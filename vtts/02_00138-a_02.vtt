WEBVTT

00:02.174 --> 00:05.479
This was, I think, about the first week of March. 
And I never saw anybody from the second hurdle on.

00:12.590 --> 00:17.598
And it was very pleasant. All right. Then Texas 
Relays, I guess, that was a big meet in those days,

00:17.838 --> 00:23.687
wasn't it? It was the biggest meet. It was the first 
outdoor meet in the country. Oh. And it was...

00:31.199 --> 00:40.478
always on the

00:31.199 --> 00:40.478
second weekend of April. And all the big schools 
from up north would come down because that would

00:40.498 --> 00:46.971
give them a chance to run outdoors for the first 
time. And the Midwestern schools were very

00:48.134 --> 00:52.583
powerful in those days, Oklahoma, Oklahoma.

00:55.583 --> 01:00.530
And Minnesota, Michigan, Notre Dame, they'd come 
down. And a lot of the smaller schools that were big

01:00.650 --> 01:06.959
in track would come down as well. And they had a lot 
of distance people. And they would come down and

01:10.224 --> 01:12.327
compete. And that was my first big meet. In fact, 
that was, well, no, I take it back. The first big

01:18.996 --> 01:22.401
meet was the Fort Worth Fat Stock Show meet. at 
Farrington Field in mid-March.

01:30.252 --> 01:34.198
And we did quite well. We had a powerful freshman 
track team that year. And we wiped everybody out.

01:41.929 --> 01:49.840
And we had powerful hurdlers, powerful 
sprinters, powerful relay teams. and we were

01:51.642 --> 01:53.484
pretty good in the field events too. We had a good 
high jumper, Don Graves from Brownwood. Weight

02:00.069 --> 02:02.651
men, we were a little shy. Colonel Landy didn't 
recruit

02:02.871 --> 02:11.479
weight men that year because he still had George 
Cadera for another two years. I guess that's why he

02:12.760 --> 02:17.284
didn't recruit any weight men until he recruited 
Darragh Hooper the following year. Right, and

02:18.024 --> 02:21.227
then at the Texas Relays, you went over there? I won 
there. I won the high hurdles and set a new freshman

02:23.133 --> 02:28.401
record. And that trophy up there came from the 
Texas Relays. How good. Clyde Littlefield

02:37.854 --> 02:43.922
presented it with tight jaws, I might add. 
Remember what the time was? Yeah, I think it was...

02:50.873 --> 02:51.394
14-7. And

02:51.614 --> 02:57.400
how did that compare with the varsity times? 
Varsity times were 14-6. So you were right. All

03:05.348 --> 03:11.134
right, then any other big meets before the 
conference meet? No, we didn't. Freshmen didn't

03:12.796 --> 03:14.377
have a conference meet. Oh, you didn't? Oh, 
really? No. We ran against Texas and Rice Fish.

03:20.285 --> 03:30.921
We'd have a triangular meet, and that was a 
conference meet because there wasn't anybody

03:20.285 --> 03:30.921
else that had a powerful fish team in the 
conference then. Did you lose any of the high

03:31.442 --> 03:34.186
hurdles that year? No, I was undefeated in both 
hurdles that year. So how did you feel

03:39.875 --> 03:45.163
athletically when you finished that spring as 
competition? I felt good. Did you have any goals

03:47.803 --> 03:53.750
you hadn't reached?

03:55.192 --> 03:57.295
Goal setting hadn't been invented then. Okay. 
Like you hear today. And I had no particular goals

04:00.518 --> 04:05.384
except just to do the best that I could. What did you 
eat or drink or not eat or drink? Or what were your

04:09.209 --> 04:13.834
diet and behavior rules for yourself? I had none, 
just don't overload myself on the day of a meet. And

04:21.610 --> 04:29.640
always try to have a bowel movement so that I'd be a 
couple of pounds lighter. And not eat just right

04:29.660 --> 04:32.243
before. Did you drink soft drinks and eat ice cream 
and malts or anything? Oh yes, sure. And there were

04:40.713 --> 04:43.737
no vitamin additives then, were there? They were 
available, but nobody took them. Steroids hadn't

04:51.050 --> 04:53.854
been invented. Herbal supplements were 
something that you fed the rabbits and goats. No,

05:00.762 --> 05:02.925
things were very simple then. And you weighed, 
what did you weigh then? I weighed 172 pounds. And

05:08.432 --> 05:11.756
you're what, 6'1"? I was 6'1". Okay. So as that 
spring is ending, has your wife moved up to College

05:15.730 --> 05:20.615
Station yet? Not yet. Okay. She would come up and 
the Andersons would move out of their master suite

05:23.398 --> 05:38.715
into

05:23.398 --> 05:38.715
Rusty's bedroom and Rusty would bunk with Wally. 
at 501 Fairview, and as a matter of fact, we spent

05:39.320 --> 05:52.137
our honeymoon in the Anderson's Master Suite that 
whole week.

05:52.357 --> 05:58.966
Think how, by today's rules, that would probably 
be some NCAA violation that the coach provided.

05:59.006 --> 06:03.131
That would be putting it mildly. I can foresee 
losing 10 scholarships, never being able to

06:08.041 --> 06:15.109
participate in the NCAA meet, all kinds of bad 
things like that. Now, do you remember what your

06:15.930 --> 06:18.753
best time was that spring? Yes. It was 14-5 in the 
high hurdles, which beat the Southwest

06:20.715 --> 06:36.293
Conference time that year, and 22-9 in the low 
hurdles, which broke the Southwest Conference

06:20.715 --> 06:36.293
record. And let's see,

06:36.712 --> 06:44.540
in high school, was it 200 yard? 200 yards. But in 
the college, was it 220? 220. 220. But it was 110 in

06:49.145 --> 06:52.248
both the highs. 120 in both. 120 in both. We ran 
yards. Oh, yeah, yeah. I'm sorry. Yeah, yeah,

06:56.533 --> 06:57.914
yeah. Okay, so as you go home, as school is out that 
spring, how did you feel about that first year? I

07:06.125 --> 07:07.687
felt very good about it. I'd had a great time. I had 
done far better than I ever anticipated.

07:19.041 --> 07:21.244
My folks were ecstatic with my grades. Colonel 
Landy, I might add, was a little proud as well. And I

07:27.873 --> 07:35.963
was inducted into Phi Eta Sigma, an honorary 
scholastic fraternity.

07:37.394 --> 07:40.158
The Beaumont A&M Club was also quite proud.

07:43.644 --> 07:47.329
Did anybody... Charlie Babcock was proud. Did 
anybody ever come up to you that year or any other

07:47.349 --> 07:57.064
year and try to hand you some money on the side or 
anything that would have been inappropriate? I'm

07:57.505 --> 08:00.790
surprised you would ask that.

08:02.353 --> 08:04.596
You ever hear of the Coconose Brothers? Mm-hmm, 
mm-hmm. Beaumont. That's C-O-K-I-N-O-S. That's

08:06.588 --> 08:09.753
right. There were four brothers, Genos, Jimmy, 
Mike, and Andy.

08:20.429 --> 08:24.395
They spent a lot of time on campus, particularly 
during football season. Jimmy would always come

08:24.455 --> 08:31.425
up with his cronies, and they'd stay, I don't know, 
someplace. And mysteriously, a black Ford would

08:35.680 --> 08:42.907
appear in the parking lot behind Hart Hall. And 
mysteriously, an envelope would appear under my

08:42.927 --> 08:53.317
door that would say, the key to that car is under the 
floor mat. And be sure and look in the glove

08:54.077 --> 08:57.321
compartment. And I would look in the glove 
compartment and there would be an envelope with a

08:57.341 --> 09:02.025
$20 bill in it. And boy, a $20 bill would go a long way 
in College Station. And frequently, my bride to be

09:07.900 --> 09:20.296
would get a ride of Jimmy for the football season, 
if my folks weren't coming. But no, other than

09:20.316 --> 09:29.869
that, when I'd go home, of course, I couldn't buy I 
couldn't buy a meal when I'd go out. Charlie Meyer

09:35.449 --> 09:38.133
was the High Sheriff of Jefferson County.

09:41.138 --> 09:48.830
He'd always insist that you come down to see him on 
Christmas Eve and you'd go down there and he'd slap

09:41.138 --> 09:48.830
a pint of Old Crow in your hand. It was a different 
era. What did you do that first summer? I went to

09:57.457 --> 10:04.163
work for Trotty and Thompson Construction 
Company, a couple of Aggies, Jess Thompson and

09:57.457 --> 10:04.163
Bill Trotty. They were late 20s, early 30s 
vintage. And they had a road construction company

10:08.848 --> 10:13.632
there in Beaumont. They did city streets and farm 
to market roads. And Ben Ramsey was the lieutenant

10:17.956 --> 10:24.983
governor at that time, and Ben Ramsey would make 
sure that Farmer Market Roads always got on the

10:25.587 --> 10:35.720
legislative agenda, since he said it was the 
Lieutenant Governor, and Trotty and Thompson got

10:25.587 --> 10:35.720
their share of contracts. It did not hurt that 
Trotty and Thompson was an informal subsidiary of

10:36.622 --> 10:55.206
Brown and Rupp,

10:36.622 --> 10:55.206
and I hired on with Trotty and Thompson and worked 
roads, dug ditches, menial labor until they found

10:55.912 --> 10:58.875
out that I could drive a truck. And then I drove a 
truck and did menial labor. And then I drove a

11:04.981 --> 11:14.670
tanker truck, a water truck for them and worked for 
them every summer for four years. All right, then

11:16.091 --> 11:24.619
in the fall of 49, coming back for your sophomore 
year, you're staying in business as a major.

11:24.987 --> 11:26.108
That's right. Do you remember what it was 
officially titled? Was it called Business or

11:28.470 --> 11:30.432
Business Administration? It was called the 
Department of Business Administration. Okay.

11:37.118 --> 11:38.779
And did your wife come with you then? Yes. And where 
did you all live? We lived...

11:42.322 --> 11:51.791
We lived there. It was 16... 16 by 16 foot hut, it was 
called. You may have seen pictures of the drill

12:00.062 --> 12:07.712
field in World War I, how they had these shacks all 
around the drill field. And that's what that was.

12:11.076 --> 12:17.724
And Colonel Andy bought one of those and moved it to 
his property for use as a servant's quarters. And

12:17.744 --> 12:20.727
this was on the back of the... The back of their 
house. And they lived on the south side of the

12:21.769 --> 12:24.492
campus? on the south side of the campus at 501 
Fairview, which was about four blocks from

12:24.691 --> 12:42.048
South Side Grocery, which is where Rother's 
bookstore is now. Yeah, yeah. And you paid rent?

12:46.512 --> 12:47.653
No. Okay. No rent. All right, what did your, did 
your wife have a job or did she stay home? No, she

12:53.193 --> 12:55.075
stayed home.

12:57.539 --> 13:00.222
There were just no jobs available. All right. You 
still were in the Corps officially. Oh,

13:05.208 --> 13:06.169
absolutely. And so you wore your uniforms. Every 
day. Describe your routine then as a young married

13:08.893 --> 13:13.399
man going to Texas A&M.

13:16.903 --> 13:21.529
I would ride my bicycle to the first class. If I felt 
like it, I would stop at Sabisa and have breakfast

13:22.640 --> 13:29.407
so my wife wouldn't have to get up and cook. We had an 
old Detroit Jewel, Detroit Jewel it's called, gas

13:30.608 --> 13:37.335
stove. And incidentally, we had to put an extra gas 
line out there to put in a water heater. That place

13:44.703 --> 13:47.005
did not have hot water. So my father-in-law and my 
dad, brought a hot water heater up one day used and

13:50.956 --> 13:59.365
we put that sucker in and we had hot water and we 
washed dishes in the bathtub. But I would go to my

14:00.366 --> 14:16.682
first class on a bicycle and most of the classes 
were down in the

14:00.366 --> 14:16.682
in the shacks they were called. And those were at 
Northgate? No, those were where the water tower is

14:21.078 --> 14:24.022
now. Yeah, yeah. I mean, on the north side of the 
campus. On the north side of the campus, yeah. And

14:27.307 --> 14:31.052
they were World War II leftover prefabs? They were 
World War II barracks buildings. Oh, barracks,

14:33.576 --> 14:34.397
okay. That had been partitioned into classrooms. 
Drafty and cold, if you wouldn't believe. Now, in

14:41.026 --> 14:44.952
49, were freshmen back on the campus? No. They're 
still? They're still out at Bryan Annex. But the

14:49.338 --> 14:51.000
campus was crowded. because of the veterans. 
That's right. We still had a lot of veterans. But

14:55.655 --> 14:57.798
they were starting to dwindle off. The class of 50 
was the largest class that had come through. I

15:03.126 --> 15:06.911
think class of 50 had 1,500 students in it. We had 
about 1,250 in our class of 52. What did you young

15:10.357 --> 15:16.185
kids think about those old World War II veterans? 
We were in awe.

15:21.018 --> 15:22.681
They didn't talk much about it. They didn't 
particularly want to. Particularly those who had

15:25.968 --> 15:27.752
been in combat. Now those who had not been in combat 
would open up more and tell you what barracks life

15:28.393 --> 15:36.269
was like and this kind of business. But we didn't 
bug them because

15:48.153 --> 15:48.934
We'd leave them alone. But we had a number of 
veterans in our classes. That bicycle that you

15:53.220 --> 15:57.426
rode to the campus, you never locked it, did you? 
No. And would you sometimes... Never thought

16:00.610 --> 16:02.633
about it. Yeah. Did you sometimes take from class 
to class or did you leave it at Sebesa? Well, I'd

16:08.401 --> 16:09.823
leave it at Sebesa. I took it with me from Every 
building. And did you come back and eat lunch on

16:16.441 --> 16:18.824
campus or go home? I'd come back and eat lunch at 
Sbisa. And your degree plan was set up so that you

16:22.929 --> 16:28.115
would graduate in four years. Oh, yes, sir. 
Everybody's was. Today's kids cannot believe it.

16:34.122 --> 16:35.584
You took 19 hours? My goodness. How could you 
handle that many? Well, engineering students had

16:39.082 --> 16:41.144
more than that. That's right. And the students 
just cannot believe that.

16:47.290 --> 16:49.332
Did you go home to eat lunch or eat on campus? I ate at 
Sabisa. At Sabisa. And then in the fall, you're a

16:51.834 --> 16:58.040
sophomore, junior, and seniors. You're still 
working out cross-country. We'd go to that

17:00.823 --> 17:06.068
cross-country course and sprain our ankles.

17:07.465 --> 17:13.633
Colonel Andy let us get by with three days a week.

17:15.936 --> 17:21.062
But then of course up popped the Sugar Bowl meet. 
Sugar Bowl had a track meet. I don't know if you do

17:22.464 --> 17:23.465
that. Yeah, I remember that. But those of us who 
were invited to the Sugar Bowl meet would have to

17:24.647 --> 17:36.021
start a pretty strenuous workout schedule in 
November and December. all the way through the

17:37.351 --> 17:38.972
Christmas holidays. And that got to be a pain. I 
mean, it was an honor to be invited to run in Sugar

17:43.977 --> 17:51.984
Bowl meet, but we had other things that we wanted to 
do. But we showed up, and we gave a good account of

17:52.004 --> 17:55.728
ourself. I was running against the West Coast

17:57.149 --> 18:05.637
record holder. And I came in second in the higher. 
Didn't have it lower. In those days, for meets like

18:13.605 --> 18:18.529
that, did you get a ribbon or a medal? What were the 
symbols of victory? For the larger meets, a medal.

18:25.836 --> 18:32.401
For the triangular meets and that sort of thing, 
you get a pat on the back. What about conference

18:33.763 --> 18:34.904
meets? Conference meets? First three places got 
medals. And even after they went to scoring five

18:40.674 --> 18:49.964
and six places, it was still first three places got 
medals. And so as you and your wife are settling in

18:49.984 --> 18:59.755
to being a married couple, what did you all do at 
night? We'd listen to the radio. We would play

19:02.545 --> 19:07.490
Canasta with Wally and Rusty Anderson.

19:10.453 --> 19:27.489
If you got your freshman numeral, which meant you 
lettered as a freshman, because freshmen were not

19:10.453 --> 19:27.489
varsity eligible in those days, you also got 20 
tickets, free tickets, to Guyon Hall, which is

19:10.453 --> 19:27.489
where movies were shown on cameras. And there 
were... various and sundry other perquisites

19:30.785 --> 19:38.776
that one came by surreptitiously. What was it like 
to go to a Gien Hall movie? How did the Aggies

19:42.721 --> 19:45.925
conduct themselves in there? Oh, well, when a 
pretty girl would come on the screen, you know, the

19:47.327 --> 19:54.136
whistles.

19:56.519 --> 19:58.682
But they were a pretty orderly bunch. And you could 
get old-fashioned popcorn and all that there. You

20:02.742 --> 20:07.488
could get popcorn and no gum. They didn't want it on 
their seats. Where else did a young couple go in the

20:09.211 --> 20:13.757
evenings if you wanted? You could go to a campus 
movie, which is where something Canyon, Shadow

20:13.777 --> 20:19.985
Canyon I think is now. And

20:21.367 --> 20:28.737
we didn't have any money. And if we did have money, 
there was no place to go. We'd play bridge. We'd go

20:34.777 --> 20:36.899
over to other couples' houses. A pretty simple 
life. A big weekend was when you'd get your $10 a

20:41.444 --> 20:58.420
month laundry check, and you'd find somebody, 
some other couple who had a car, and you would go

20:41.444 --> 20:58.420
down to the Triangle Drive Inn, which is where 
Chicken Oil Company is now. And you'd get a big,

21:03.325 --> 21:10.754
juicy hamburger on a giant elephant ear bun. And 
that was really living it up. You could get a

21:14.118 --> 21:20.546
hamburger for 50 cents and a huge Coke for two bits. 
Now, if a couple, whether it be y'all or anyone

21:21.447 --> 21:28.356
else, if a young couple wanted to do something 
pretty wild, What possibilities were there in

21:28.994 --> 21:31.136
Brazos County? I don't know where you'd do it. I'm 
not sure what you mean by why. Was there a place that

21:38.263 --> 21:42.688
a person could get legally or otherwise alcoholic 
beverages? Not legally, but you could get it.

21:46.231 --> 21:48.294
Whiskey Bridge was the closest place. And the old 
stone statues are still there to this day. The

21:54.900 --> 21:57.583
bridge has been dismantled, I guess sold for 
scrap. But you'd just go across Whiskey Bridge and

21:57.952 --> 22:08.623
get a half pint, or a pint was the most anybody could 
afford. And you'd have to make that last. Now, was

22:10.324 --> 22:12.406
Uncle Ed's operating in that era? Uncle Ed's was 
operating in, of course, I never took my wife out to

22:12.506 --> 22:20.034
Uncle Ed's. I don't know of anybody that took a date 
out to Uncle Ed's either. We'd just go out there for

22:24.298 --> 22:27.081
good bull and a couple of beers. Now, beer was 
legal, wasn't it? In Brassets County. Brassets

22:32.562 --> 22:34.824
County, that's what I mean, yeah. Was there a boot, 
nobody that I've asked this question of has had an

22:35.264 --> 22:41.750
answer that yes, they did. Did you ever hear of a 
bootlegger in Brassets County? Never did. And

22:48.196 --> 22:52.140
there was no House of Ill Repute in Brassets 
County, was there? I never heard anybody mention

22:52.160 --> 22:53.481
one. Brenham, I think, was the closest place. Now, 
was the chicken ranch, did you guys know about the

22:56.002 --> 22:59.948
chicken ranch? Oh, yeah. Is that right? The 
chicken ranch was alive and well. Did Aggies

23:05.196 --> 23:07.340
really go over to the chicken ranch? Absolutely. 
Was there any kind of a ritual that a fish was

23:09.903 --> 23:14.991
supposed to go or anything like that?

23:18.377 --> 23:19.739
I suppose there might have been. I wasn't aware of 
it.

23:24.082 --> 23:27.506
Fish didn't go, I guess for a couple of reasons. 
They didn't have a car. They didn't have any money.

23:32.191 --> 23:35.674
The upperclassmen had cars and usually a little 
more money. And I don't know, maybe they'd get

23:37.096 --> 23:42.882
together a car load once a semester or something 
like that and go. Now there was no organized

23:43.443 --> 23:49.189
activity on the campus for married students, was 
there? There was no... No. Hey, honey. There were

23:53.849 --> 23:58.633
no scheduled activities specifically for 
married couples, were there? Student married

23:59.014 --> 23:59.934
couples? Oh, I think there may have been some music 
groups, bridge groups, something like that. We

24:09.923 --> 24:17.209
had a bowling alley in the basement of the Y, but I 
think there were two alleys or something. You just

24:18.991 --> 24:21.133
didn't get a whole lot of people down there. Was Mr. 
Cashin still active in those days? Which Cashin

24:25.422 --> 24:27.025
are you talking about? Red and Jim's dad. I did not 
know Mr. Cashin. Okay. He's the one that created

24:32.575 --> 24:36.001
the Y, and I don't know when he died. Mrs. Cashin, 
she ended up being the lady that ran the big board of

24:36.501 --> 24:45.718
directors house on the north side of Sabeasa. 
After he died, she was the lady responsible for

24:46.659 --> 24:49.945
operating it. I remember the house, but I do not 
remember Jesus Cash. What about religious

24:56.983 --> 24:59.425
groups? Were you all churchgoers then? 
Occasionally.

25:05.571 --> 25:10.075
There were a number of religious groups for all 
religions here. There was the Hillel Society for

25:10.135 --> 25:15.700
the Jewish students, and they were very active. 
There were Protestant men in the chapel. Each of

25:19.810 --> 25:31.824
the local churches sponsored a youth activity 
group that was geared towards students. Do you

25:33.746 --> 25:36.470
remember Religious Emphasis Week in the spring? I 
remember the name, I remember it happening,

25:37.090 --> 25:49.665
but I was usually too involved off on a track trip 
someplace to be able to participate. But we

25:49.932 --> 25:53.236
weren't really churchy. Describe the student 
body during your four years here. Describe the

25:57.061 --> 25:58.643
student body in general. Where were they from? 
What kinds of family backgrounds, their

26:01.287 --> 26:08.456
attitudes, their ancestry, et cetera? The 
majority of the student body was WASP, white,

26:10.599 --> 26:18.049
Anglo-Saxon, Protestant. We had just a 
smattering of Hispanics. A

26:23.810 --> 26:32.419
few Jewish students, Aaron Cohen, a classmate of 
mine. Aaron made a tremendous name for himself at

26:32.639 --> 26:40.047
the Johnson Space Center.

26:40.568 --> 26:43.591
How were Jewish students treated by the other 
students? Just like everybody else. Not a bit of

26:45.940 --> 26:46.861
difference. Same for the Hispanic students. They 
were just part of the gang. Were there any

26:52.148 --> 26:56.214
international students that you remember? There 
were, but they were mostly graduate students and

26:57.055 --> 27:02.462
we didn't have a lot of contact with them. They were 
mostly in engineering and agriculture. And there

27:06.548 --> 27:09.913
were almost no Asian students in those days, were 
there? Not then. That's what I thought. There were

27:11.495 --> 27:15.340
Latin American students,

27:16.450 --> 27:45.428
no i don't recall any european students don't 
recall any canadian students but there were there

27:16.450 --> 27:45.428
were there was a rare asiatic student now there 
were a bunch of catholic kids oh yeah german czech

27:16.450 --> 27:45.428
polish you bet uh hometown clubs were still going 
big then hometown clubs were big what were they why

27:16.450 --> 27:45.428
were make believe i didn't know why they existed 
well uh Because you got to get back with your own

27:46.032 --> 27:59.994
kind and talk about, hey, who's going with Susie 
now that she's off at TSCW, that kind of thing. And

28:00.014 --> 28:04.161
who's got an extra seat in the car going home this 
week? Who's going home? You kept book on who's

28:04.982 --> 28:07.706
going home in the car. Did you ever hitchhike as an 
Aggie? Frequently. Frequently. make believe I'd

28:14.129 --> 28:15.631
never heard of that. Describe how an Aggie 
hitchhiked. Well, at Eastgate,

28:17.433 --> 28:23.299
there was what was called the Aggie Line. And the 
first freshman to show up would be elected. Well,

28:30.167 --> 28:31.128
he wasn't elected. He was told to go out there and 
stand and stick out his thumb for a ride. We always

28:36.553 --> 28:38.676
hitchhiked in uniform. And in those days, it was 
easy to hitchhike. And people who came back and

28:43.576 --> 28:52.868
forth on Highway 6 knew Aggies and they would 
always stop to pick them up. The drill was that the

28:53.549 --> 29:03.501
freshman who was standing out there with his thumb 
out, when the car stopped, he'd say, yes sir, where

28:53.549 --> 29:03.501
are you going and how many people can you take? The 
driver would tell him and he'd holler back and say,

29:04.082 --> 29:08.267
two going to Houston. The first two guys in line who 
were going to Houston pick up their go to hell bag

29:12.854 --> 29:16.058
and run out there and get in the car. And some of us 
had these little tickets that we would give to the

29:17.059 --> 29:30.075
driver of the car and solving them of any blame and 
any liability and tell them who we are and that kind

29:17.059 --> 29:30.075
of thing. So it made the driver feel better about 
it. I've hitchhiked all over this state. All

29:36.462 --> 29:42.810
right, if you were hitchhiking from Beaumont, 
where was the best place to catch the ride? You'd go

29:44.056 --> 29:55.732
out 290, I mean Highway 90, toward Houston at 
Amelia, which in that day was about four or five

29:44.056 --> 29:55.732
miles out of town. And after Highway 105 got to be 
improved from being just a logging road, 105 was a

29:57.314 --> 30:10.994
good place to go. You'd go about... four or five 
miles north of town, where 105 came into 69, and 105

30:12.592 --> 30:24.864
would bring you right into Navasota, and then 
you'd get on Highway 6 and come up here. Was there a

30:25.265 --> 30:31.931
special, and I don't know the answer to this one, 
was there kind of a specially good place in Houston

30:25.265 --> 30:31.931
to get a ride? Was there a certain corner? The 
Houston A&M Club would put up little shacks out on

30:43.743 --> 30:53.637
Highway 90 and on Highway 290, right where Highway 
6 would take off from Highway 90, there was a shack.

30:53.697 --> 30:57.042
And that would keep you out of the weather. And if I 
may spin this little yarn. Please do. My roommate,

31:03.571 --> 31:08.738
Walter Evans, and I were hitchhiking This was when 
I was a freshman, he was a sophomore. For some

31:12.181 --> 31:20.533
reason, Evans couldn't get a car off his dad's used 
car lot that weekend and we were having to

31:12.181 --> 31:20.533
hitchhike back late.
