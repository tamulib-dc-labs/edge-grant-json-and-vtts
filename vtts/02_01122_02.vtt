WEBVTT

00:02.005 --> 00:18.692
We publish booklets, and we give them information 
at closing, and we visit with all the landscape

00:02.005 --> 00:18.692
architects and architectural, I mean, landscape 
firms that operate in the woodlands to try to get

00:02.005 --> 00:18.692
them to think about this natural environment and 
saving trees. So that's an ongoing process. Yeah,

00:22.298 --> 00:28.548
every year we have something called Arbor Day, and 
we've given away, how many of them? 330 pounds.

00:29.815 --> 00:38.145
seedlings and small trees, and people stand in 
line to get those trees, and they take them home,

00:29.815 --> 00:38.145
and they plant them in the yard. They plant them. 
And we did get to have the wildflower festival.

00:43.932 --> 00:47.557
Wildflowers are deeply part of the image of the 
woodlands. Lady Bird Johnson has been here for

00:48.217 --> 00:50.961
several seminars. She's deeply involved in 
wildflowers. Texas wildflowers are something we

00:53.356 --> 01:01.507
plant and cultivate every year and have a very 
well-defined program to propagate those. At what

01:02.588 --> 01:09.057
point following 86 did you feel like you were 
rounding the hump, let's say, of the financial

01:02.588 --> 01:09.057
priority? You may not have felt that way yet. I 
guess we're still working on it. Statistically,

01:15.566 --> 01:19.431
the third quarter of 1987 is when The Houston 
economy started rebounding. I think we gained

01:23.015 --> 01:29.982
12,000 jobs in Houston in the third quarter of 1987 
after having lost 200,000. That was the first time

01:30.023 --> 01:32.545
you could see it coming back. In 1988, I think we 
gained maybe 30,000 jobs at about that level,

01:33.286 --> 01:38.893
maybe 40,000 jobs in 1989. Also, according to a 
study done by Barton Smith at the University of

01:40.274 --> 01:49.705
Houston, you probably know, Houston is now about 
60% energy-dependent, where it was 80%

01:50.478 --> 01:58.308
energy-dependent. And the strengths are, you 
know, the port of Houston, it's number one in the

01:58.328 --> 02:08.300
nation in terms of export tonnage. And most of that 
is not petroleum-related. It's grain and

02:10.623 --> 02:13.206
foodstuffs and things like that. The NASA Space 
Center, of course, has come back strongly during

02:14.127 --> 02:18.392
the downturn. During that downturn, we were 
blessed, too, with the largest highway

02:19.722 --> 02:29.292
construction program ever undertaken in this 
region. More than a billion dollars a year was

02:29.312 --> 02:38.942
spent on highway construction in the Houston 
region, which exceeded any other state in the

02:29.312 --> 02:38.942
nation except California for a five-year period 
of time. And, of course, the tremendous growth and

02:39.883 --> 02:48.953
expansion of the Texas Medical Center, a $5 
billion expansion program underway out there,

02:39.883 --> 02:48.953
and it's still ongoing. really helped the Houston 
economy. Compact Computer came into being and

02:52.012 --> 02:55.976
didn't exist in 1982. And that's one of the major 
companies in this country. And it's located 20

02:59.439 --> 03:01.421
miles away. The biotechnology industry and 
startup companies that have come out of that. Dr.

03:09.768 --> 03:13.852
Dominic Lamb, you'll enjoy that interview. He's a 
very interesting, intelligent, bright,

03:13.872 --> 03:18.096
energetic person. You'll get a lot from Dr. Lamb.

03:24.871 --> 03:35.264
There was another matter I was going to mention.

03:39.629 --> 03:44.375
By 88, you can see things moving in the right 
direction. 89 was a good year. This year, we'll

03:45.597 --> 03:48.100
have a record year in home sales. So far, we've sold 
almost $120 billion worth of homes, $120 million

03:48.873 --> 04:01.071
worth of homes, $120 million worth of new homes 
this year. Oh, no, the Barton Smith study. We had

04:04.716 --> 04:14.050
him conduct a study to determine what is the impact 
of the Woodlands on the economy of Montgomery

04:04.716 --> 04:14.050
County. In the early days, the Woodlands was not 
well accepted by Montgomery County. great deal of

04:17.982 --> 04:45.593
suspicion doubt and uncertainty even hostility 
from the hostility and there is still some of that

04:17.982 --> 04:45.593
but it's it's beginning to wane and obviously it's 
not so bad but the interesting thing about that

04:17.982 --> 04:45.593
study is that now the woodlands constitutes 17 of 
the tax base in the county it is the biggest single

04:17.982 --> 04:45.593
taxpaying entity in the county today at one time 
the connor oil field was the dominant economic

04:46.315 --> 05:13.774
generator for taxes in the county and now the 
woodlands exceeds and when i say the woodlands i

04:46.315 --> 05:13.774
mean all the homes collectively the woodland pays 
more taxes than the common law bill pays to support

04:46.315 --> 05:13.774
schools and the county government we also now 
constitute about 16 percent of the voting

04:46.315 --> 05:13.774
population in the county

05:14.513 --> 05:25.408
The community is predominantly Republican, 
predominantly conservative, and it's changed

05:14.513 --> 05:25.408
the shape of politics within the county. When I 
moved here 20-something years ago into

05:25.749 --> 05:38.286
Montgomery County, you could not find anyone who 
would profess to be a Republican, except Dr. Wally

05:25.749 --> 05:38.286
Wilkerson, who was part of the Republican Party. 
Today, you can't find anybody who agrees that

05:38.346 --> 05:43.153
they're a Democrat.

05:43.927 --> 05:51.976
Local office holders who originally were elected 
as Democrats have now changed to the Republican

05:43.927 --> 05:51.976
Party for fear of being defeated. The Woodlands 
has done, I think, a number of positive things for

05:52.617 --> 05:56.201
the county. It's helped create economic growth. 
It's helped create jobs. It's provided, I think,

06:00.806 --> 06:08.395
the numbers, 25% of the retail sales are generated 
by people who live in the Woodlands. That's not 25%

06:08.435 --> 06:11.098
retail sales occurring in the Woodlands. But the 
population of the women's generates 25% of the

06:11.315 --> 06:17.261
retail sales. Has this study been published? I'll 
give you a copy of it. I think we'd like that. Jack,

06:22.506 --> 06:23.507
could you see it? It's interesting reading. And I 
got Dr. Smith to do it, so it would be objective. We

06:30.414 --> 06:35.779
could do it, but that would not be held to be fairly 
objective. Credibility would be questioned,

06:35.839 --> 06:37.761
but... This will give you some good background 
information from a third-party source. It's got a

06:41.961 --> 06:58.020
good executive summary, and then he kind of gets 
involved in the science of evaluating

06:41.961 --> 06:58.020
demographics and economic evaluation.

06:58.040 --> 07:06.550
The executive summary makes more exciting 
reading than the methodology.

07:07.677 --> 07:36.925
Well, you know, we've

07:07.677 --> 07:36.925
got the

07:07.677 --> 07:36.925
same over in the Gulf, and we've got oil prices that 
went down $5 a barrel yesterday, and I don't know

07:07.677 --> 07:36.925
what they've done today, and there is a 
devastating financial conditions for financing

07:37.293 --> 07:41.977
real estate nationally. And while the market is 
good in the Houston region, financial

07:42.178 --> 07:49.064
institutions don't look favorably upon real 
estate financing. So I think it's going to have

07:49.144 --> 07:56.911
some detrimental effect on Houston, even though 
we're doing much better than the nation as a whole.

07:56.931 --> 08:00.855
We still look to the money-centered banks for a lot 
of financing. And I don't think that it's going to

08:00.915 --> 08:06.220
be as generous as we would like for it to be. But so 
far we've spent $2 billion in the river, total. $2

08:13.668 --> 08:16.811
billion has been invested by all parties in the 
river. A billion dollars of that is in residential

08:16.831 --> 08:22.355
homes owned by third parties. The rest of it's in 
schools and churches and office buildings and

08:22.375 --> 08:35.667
research facilities and land development and

08:22.375 --> 08:35.667
those kinds of things. The total investment in the 
woodlands will be about $12 billion by all

08:36.608 --> 08:42.235
parties. And the population will be somewhere 
around 150,000 people. And we anticipate having

08:46.580 --> 08:51.646
about 80,000 permanent jobs. Someone asked, when 
are you going to finish developing the woodlands?

08:56.852 --> 09:01.457
And the very clear answer is that we never will, 
because no city is ever complete. I don't think

09:01.497 --> 09:05.502
you've ever driven through any city in this 
country where you could they have finished. I

09:08.219 --> 09:16.287
mean, there will always be redevelopment, 
reconstruction of buildings, replacement of

09:08.219 --> 09:16.287
housing. But essentially, most of the 
development will have occurred by the year 2027,

09:16.307 --> 09:25.897
2020, 2030.

09:26.557 --> 09:27.578
Somewhere in that range. We have a very definite 
plan year by year, unit by unit. You asked about the

09:33.545 --> 10:02.758
the strategy for developing it that we have a an 
economic model that we update annually that looks

09:33.545 --> 10:02.758
forward and takes into account changes since we 
last did it is that in-house is that done in there we

09:33.545 --> 10:02.758
do it with some outside consulting help but it's a 
it's an in-house document that we could use for our

09:33.545 --> 10:02.758
own planning purposes and we don't publish that 
well do you see that this kind of expansion

09:33.545 --> 10:02.758
population growth as being a threat or a great 
difficulty in uh continuing to manage the

10:03.093 --> 10:11.581
environment and the quality of life type 
situation, or do you feel quite comfortable that

10:03.093 --> 10:11.581
can be accommodated? I think it can be 
accomplished, but it's becoming more

10:11.601 --> 10:15.305
complicated. I think the 1990s is going to be the 
decade of the environment. We see things like

10:20.610 --> 10:31.260
concern about hazardous waste, endangered 
species, the wetlands, the Clean Air Act. All of

10:31.679 --> 10:33.702
those things are going to come to bear. Frankly, I 
don't think in the future you're going to see very

10:34.523 --> 10:43.395
many large-scale communities like the woodlands 
undertaken in the future for those very reasons.

10:43.415 --> 10:54.971
There's so much uncertainty over the life span of 
developing a community like this that you deal

10:43.415 --> 10:54.971
with a lot of uncertainties, a lot of risk 
involved. You have so much front-end investment

10:55.652 --> 10:59.357
that you have to recoup out of out of the assumption 
of later development no i don't

11:00.147 --> 11:28.163
i don't think you probably will i think the 
government involvement should be one of

11:00.147 --> 11:28.163
providing incentives and not providing 
roadblocks actually you know some people look at

11:00.147 --> 11:28.163
the woodlands as a government-sponsored 
community We borrowed $50 million to start the

11:29.223 --> 11:35.611
development of the Woodlands, but we're paying 
that back. That was a loan. That was not a gift from

11:36.292 --> 11:38.915
heaven. It was a little lower interest rate, but 
when you add to it all the administrative cost of

11:40.197 --> 11:51.491
monitoring that for the government and reporting 
and the hassle you go through, I'm not sure it was a

11:40.197 --> 11:51.491
good bargain. George Mitchell will tell you it was 
a tremendous bargain, but I lived over here

11:51.752 --> 11:58.420
working on those reports that had to go in, and I was 
There was a cost attached to that. But I think the

12:02.178 --> 12:06.364
environment is going to be a great challenge in the 
future. We, I think, tried to address it very well.

12:09.007 --> 12:11.231
And I think we've done a pretty good job of it. But I 
think there are going to be more and more rules and

12:11.251 --> 12:19.222
regulations promulgated without a clear 
understanding of the impact. It's going to cause

12:20.103 --> 12:23.888
uncertainty and delays. And the delays is money. 
When you get one of these started, you really need

12:27.087 --> 12:30.952
to move along with it. You can't have periods of 
time when you do nothing. What projects are you

12:36.419 --> 12:41.505
really devoting most of your time to right now? Or 
is there any kind of affinity like that? Well, I'm

12:44.368 --> 12:50.496
pretty well involved in all the projects that are 
going on. It's hard in a community like this to

12:51.067 --> 12:56.415
separate it into a series of projects. They're all 
interrelated. Right now, this week, we have the

12:58.418 --> 13:05.729
formal opening of the new 18-hole golf course 
designed by Arnold Palmer. And we are expanding

13:05.749 --> 13:11.478
the country club and the large... What is that 
opening? It's on the 30th. You're invited. Thank

13:14.202 --> 13:14.503
you, sir. It's coming at 11 o'clock. But we're... 
Right now, after being here 15 years, a number of

13:20.767 --> 13:34.625
our facilities are 15 years old, and we have had an 
ongoing refurbishing program, but right now it's

13:20.767 --> 13:34.625
a little more intensive than it has been in the 
past. We've renovated the conference center,

13:35.226 --> 13:46.340
updated the guest rooms, enlarging the country 
club, separating the conference center from the

13:35.226 --> 13:46.340
country club for their two separate entities over 
there. We're enlarging the golf facilities

13:46.380 --> 13:49.204
because the The membership has grown 
tremendously. We're engaged in, continually

13:52.986 --> 14:03.216
engaged in this economic development program and 
encouraging businesses to locate here. And the

14:03.237 --> 14:13.167
main thrust in that, again, would be right now is in 
the medical area, in the, say, in the umbrella of

14:03.237 --> 14:13.167
the advanced research area. And also 
well-established companies looking for a home.

14:17.213 --> 14:22.021
For example, we have the products testing 
laboratory for Penzol here, a well-established

14:17.213 --> 14:22.021
company. Betts Process Chemical has a major 
operation here. Up in the Trade Center, you may or

14:26.127 --> 14:37.585
may not have seen it, it's a rail to serve Trade 
Center and major distribution centers there

14:26.127 --> 14:37.585
owned by Michelin Tire, Kraft Food, Eckerd Drug, 
The distribution outlet for McDonald's, as well

14:38.138 --> 14:43.223
as Burger King are there. Are you continuing that 
expansion? Yeah. As a matter of fact, most of our

14:46.206 --> 14:48.608
buildings are completely full there. We have an 
ongoing program to enhance and improve the

14:50.510 --> 15:00.000
mobility of the region through the encouragement 
of improving highways. We've created here in the

15:00.721 --> 15:07.167
Woodlands, and I think this is kind of unique, 
we've created a commuter van system. and also

15:07.737 --> 15:12.845
commuter bus parking ride system. We're outside 
the service area of the Houston Metro, so they

15:12.865 --> 15:19.856
could not bring buses into the woodlands. So we 
worked through the county and got a federal grant

15:19.876 --> 15:27.568
and we built a parking ride lot and we financed the 
buses. it's now being operated by brazos transit

15:27.970 --> 15:57.910
authority which is located in brian right they do a 
good job yeah they do a good job here too so we've

15:27.970 --> 15:57.910
been able to take uh you know four or five six 
hundred cars off the highway by creating uh

15:27.970 --> 15:57.910
alternative systems for transportation is there 
no internal transportation yeah would you

15:27.970 --> 15:57.910
anticipate ever having to do something like that 
well we're setting aside rights aways and the

15:27.970 --> 15:57.910
provision for that to occur There's no defined 
plan to make it happen currently. Most of those

16:03.024 --> 16:05.167
that have been attempted have failed. Without 
some heavy subsidy, it's hard to, even up to Brian,

16:06.910 --> 16:13.481
I don't know. What about rail service? Do you need 
to teach them anything in monorail or anything

16:15.063 --> 16:20.412
like that in the Houston-Dallas connection? 
Well, that's always a possibility, and part of the

16:24.822 --> 16:41.320
There's a

16:24.822 --> 16:41.320
plan for this high-speed rail from Dallas to 
Houston and to San Antonio, and there are a couple

16:24.822 --> 16:41.320
of alternate routes for that, both to the west of 
the Woodlands. They would not come through the

16:41.340 --> 16:51.792
Woodlands, so I don't think we'd be exposed to that 
opportunity, but we do have a rail system here in

16:41.340 --> 16:51.792
Front Door. There's great debate in the city of 
Houston, as you know right now, about heavy rail,

16:52.463 --> 16:59.851
whether or not to have it, and if so, where, and who 
pays for it. If, as you commented, the 90s become

17:01.313 --> 17:14.828
the decade of the environment, highway building, 
if it's pursued logically, would diminish, I

17:01.313 --> 17:14.828
would think. Alternative, as you suggested, 
alternative modes would have to then increase.

17:21.269 --> 17:22.992
Yeah, I think you're going to see those pressures. 
I think you're exactly right. With respect to the

17:25.776 --> 17:39.776
specific question about rail, I don't think 
that's in the immediate 10-year horizon just

17:25.776 --> 17:39.776
because of cost, time to build it, who owns it and 
how it operates. There are a lot of questions that

17:40.497 --> 17:48.829
need to be answered about rail before it's 
implemented anywhere in the Houston region, I

17:40.497 --> 17:48.829
think. Great debate about that. What about

17:55.249 --> 18:04.140
recreation

17:55.249 --> 18:04.140
as an economic investment? That's a good 
question. Back when I got started in the real

18:06.964 --> 18:18.259
estate development business, developers 
typically built golf courses to help sell land and

18:06.964 --> 18:18.259
then hope they didn't lose too much money and 
usually gave it away to The members, if they would

18:18.593 --> 18:30.485
take it or sell it to someone for a small number of 
dollars, Club Corporation of America became

18:18.593 --> 18:30.485
wealthy by taking over clubs that developers 
didn't know how to run or that members couldn't

18:18.593 --> 18:30.485
operate. Today, that's changed. Golf is a 
business, and it's a profitable business. We just

18:38.893 --> 18:42.557
finished a study looking at golf meets in the 
woodlands. Right now, we have four 18-hole golf

18:42.637 --> 18:45.360
courses. One of them is a tournament players 
course, which is in fact a day-to-day course. You

18:50.955 --> 18:52.537
don't have to be a member to play. We have one course 
for the conferees who visit the conference center

18:53.398 --> 18:59.265
for recreational purposes. And we have two 
18-hole courses set aside for country club

18:59.285 --> 19:04.711
membership. And we had the firm by the name of Real 
Estate Research Associates of California do a

19:04.731 --> 19:16.005
comprehensive study course looking at the total 
golf needs in demand throughout the life of the

19:16.745 --> 19:19.849
Woodlands. And in total, we need 10 golf courses in 
the Woodlands, 10 18-hole golf courses. So we need

19:25.296 --> 19:26.838
six more than we have today. And that would be a 
combination of the second tournament players

19:27.559 --> 19:43.039
course, which we have the right to build, a 36-hole 
daily fee course, a public course, for those who

19:27.559 --> 19:43.039
cannot afford or choose not to belong to a country 
club, And then a more exclusive country club than

19:43.677 --> 19:55.715
the one we have today, a higher end club, maybe an 
equity club where the members would own that.

19:55.735 --> 20:10.478
We're combining that now with our land planning 
for the remaining portions of the woodlands to

19:55.735 --> 20:10.478
make sure we set aside enough land in the right 
place to accommodate those golfing

19:55.735 --> 20:10.478
needs. Yeah. We've

20:12.147 --> 20:32.430
got all the real estate falls under... We've got 
two parcels of land in Colorado, one between Aspen

20:12.147 --> 20:32.430
and Snowmass and one at Steamboat Springs. And the 
regulatory environment up there is a morass.

20:37.035 --> 20:39.418
Yeah, dealing with everybody. Forest Service is 
the one who grants permits, but you deal with

20:39.635 --> 20:47.564
everyone who chooses to deal with you. But in the 
area between Aspen and Snowmass, we have

20:47.724 --> 20:54.832
developed about 800 acres of land. And have sold 
lots to individuals who have built homes. And

21:02.000 --> 21:09.068
that's in the very beautiful Owl Creek Valley that 
extends the entire distance from the town of Aspen

21:02.000 --> 21:09.068
to the town of Snowmass. And in Steamboat Springs, 
we have 3,000 acres of land that we own jointly with

21:09.925 --> 21:17.919
a third party. And there, we're actively trying to 
get a permit to build a ski mountain. And that one

21:24.230 --> 21:30.280
will take on a different character from what we 
have in Aspen. has been very low density. The only

21:32.685 --> 21:42.439
thing that, you know, recreation ties nicely with 
your quality of life and with the types of your

21:32.685 --> 21:42.439
medical care, atmosphere, and all of that. Even 
with the environmental. The jogging path. Yeah.

21:46.685 --> 21:51.032
You asked about other recreational things here in 
the Woodlands, and you mentioned jogging path.

21:51.052 --> 21:55.278
That's probably the single most popular 
recreational amenity we have. We have 53 miles of

21:55.318 --> 21:58.663
pathway. And it costs... $20 a foot to build that. 
Is that your cost? $10,000.

22:10.959 --> 22:13.842
$10,000 a month. $5 to $10 million invested in this 
pathway. I mean, that's a tremendous investment

22:18.127 --> 22:22.853
in a recreational facility. But it's used by 
everybody. Kids on bicycles, people out for

22:25.196 --> 22:31.603
exercise, people both jogging and riding 
bicycles and actually commuting in some cases

22:32.090 --> 22:37.957
from home to school and from home to shopping. 
We've got some of the retirement communities

22:38.517 --> 22:50.451
located close to the shopping center, and you see 
people in wheelchairs walking down and moving

22:38.517 --> 22:50.451
down a pathway to go to the grocery store. So it's 
kind of a nice feel to it. We have a swimming

22:54.416 --> 22:56.578
athletic center, which is Olympic quality in 
terms of its facilities. As a matter of fact,

23:00.745 --> 23:10.520
Olympic tryouts are held there, and we're in the 
process of enlarging and upgrading that

23:00.745 --> 23:10.520
currently. I think in summary, I really don't know 
how much time you wanted to give us, but... I've

23:15.026 --> 23:16.288
still got a couple of questions. Okay, you go 
ahead. Well, one of the things which you started,

23:17.771 --> 23:22.057
and then we got distracted away from it. You 
mentioned some of the things that in the future...

23:26.714 --> 23:31.041
not that they're worried, but the things you're 
planning to do. The other side of that coin is, what

23:31.061 --> 23:37.571
are the future incentives or the initiatives that 
you perceive? Are there future initiatives? Is it

23:38.973 --> 23:47.005
going to be business as usual, or are there other 
initiatives that the Woodlands is going to

23:38.973 --> 23:47.005
develop in the next two to three decades? Well, 
yeah, there are very specific things that we need

23:47.566 --> 23:52.874
to develop in the next several decades. One is town 
center. Town center is well-defined on paper,

23:56.414 --> 24:00.317
still defined if you try to find it. But it will 
include about 17 million square feet of office

24:00.338 --> 24:12.248
space, which is equivalent to the downtown of 
probably Cincinnati, if you measure in square

24:00.338 --> 24:12.248
footage. But it will include a regional shopping 
mall, and it will be the urbanized center for

24:12.268 --> 24:18.033
Northeastern. Not only the urbanized center for 
Woodlands, but we look at that as a focal point for

24:18.053 --> 24:25.320
business in Northeastern. It's a Termination of 
the Hardy Toll Road is on I-45. It's the

24:28.004 --> 24:36.374
intersection of some major east-west roadways 
under design and partially under construction.

24:36.394 --> 24:39.117
And it will be the center of population for more 
than a million people. So we look at that as a big

24:40.039 --> 24:47.167
item on our agenda for the next 10 to 15 years. We 
look at the research forest only at beginning

24:47.187 --> 24:52.875
stages right now. And we would hope that we would 
have 15,000, 20,000 jobs in the research forest

24:54.498 --> 24:58.723
over the next 20 years. And in fact, do things like 
have been done in the research triangle of North

24:59.363 --> 25:10.415
Carolina, or around the Stanford and the Silicon 
Valley, or Route 128 in Boston. So that's a

25:10.435 --> 25:13.118
long-term goal and objective. We work on it every 
day. And we try not to lose sense of direction of

25:14.279 --> 25:22.028
where we're trying to get to and be discouraged if 
we haven't gotten there as quickly as we'd like.

25:22.368 --> 25:24.370
Those are two very big elements. uh beyond that the 
the continuation of a quality residential

25:25.328 --> 25:50.475
program on the remaining lands in the woodlands 
that continues to provide housing opportunities

25:25.328 --> 25:50.475
for the secretary and the clerk in the grocery 
store as well as the chairman of the board all done

25:25.328 --> 25:50.475
in a tasteful way neighborhoods that are close 
together so you get the social intermixing of

25:50.995 --> 26:19.737
school level anyway public schools where you 
don't have an elitist side of town and a poor side of

25:50.995 --> 26:19.737
town so that's an objective we had from the 
beginning and we still pursue we have a couple of

25:50.995 --> 26:19.737
major lakes we'd like to build in the woods for 
recreational purposes and that's going to take

25:50.995 --> 26:19.737
some regulatory approvals governmental health 
and things like that but that's part of the mission

25:50.995 --> 26:19.737
that we look at as being important to us. Let me ask 
you a couple of specific questions. My brother's a

26:29.136 --> 26:32.381
city manager in Las Vegas. We've been doing that 
for more than a dozen years. I called him several

26:36.607 --> 26:40.172
months ago, or actually a better part of a year ago, 
when we first started kicking around. Well, over

26:40.777 --> 26:49.769
the years I've talked to them, I'm completely at 
sea when it comes to the niceties or the crudities,

26:40.777 --> 26:49.769
however you want to look at it. I've run in a 
community. Both definitions are right. You

26:52.872 --> 26:55.135
mentioned that the Woodlands is 
non-incorporated. That's right. Will it be?

26:57.298 --> 27:03.626
Well, let me give you the legal side and then maybe 
the practical side, a little background. Right

27:03.646 --> 27:06.109
now we have a community association. It was formed 
when the Woodlands was created. and is supported

27:09.312 --> 27:16.201
financially by assessments applied against all 
properties that have been developed in the river.

27:16.221 --> 27:18.865
And it has about a $6 million budget now. And it 
provides all the municipal services that the city

27:18.885 --> 27:38.070
would provide, including the fire department, 
the collection of garbage, the street escape

27:18.885 --> 27:38.070
maintenance, neighborhood watch programs, 
emergency medical services, street lights,

27:18.885 --> 27:38.070
mowing grass, maintaining the parks and 
pathways. It does everything the city would do.

27:40.244 --> 27:48.935
And the outlook is for that mechanism to continue 
until one of two things happens. The woodlands

27:48.955 --> 27:59.267
become separately incorporated in the city, or 
it's incorporated into the corporate boundaries

27:48.955 --> 27:59.267
of the city of Houston. And under current state 
law, the woodlands is in the extracurricular

27:59.327 --> 28:06.336
jurisdiction of the city of Houston. And the city 
of Houston has the right and authority to annex the

28:07.278 --> 28:12.064
woodlands any time it would like to do that. As a 
practical matter, I don't think they will for

28:13.246 --> 28:18.392
another year for a couple reasons. One, we're not 
contiguous to the existing boundaries of the city

28:18.412 --> 28:28.085
of Houston, and they would have to step over a lot of 
the land that would not be in their corporate

28:18.412 --> 28:28.085
boundaries. And two, they're not going to annex 
the woodlands as long as there is a significant

28:31.848 --> 28:40.202
debt existing in the municipal utility districts 
that have been created to provide utilities until

28:31.848 --> 28:40.202
that debt is paid down. I would think that over the 
next 20 years, unless state law changes, that

28:41.263 --> 28:54.244
Woodlands will become part of the City of Houston. 
Is that an assumption built into your strategic

28:55.086 --> 28:57.590
plans? Yes. I'll go on to say, too, that if you took a 
vote in the Woodlands today, there'd probably be

28:59.607 --> 29:11.666
90% of the people who would choose not to be in the 
city of Houston and maybe 10% who would. So it's not

29:12.588 --> 29:16.554
necessarily a popular decision. But when you 
think about it on a regional basis and step aside

29:16.574 --> 29:25.969
from the selfish, what's best for me question, 
Cities up in the northeastern part of the country

29:26.422 --> 29:40.477
and other parts of the country have been choked, 
small incorporated cities surrounding them,

29:26.422 --> 29:40.477
productive people moving out of the inner city, 
living and paying taxes in these small

29:26.422 --> 29:40.477
incorporated areas. And the central city has no 
tax base or declining tax base to provide

29:41.197 --> 29:55.112
essential services, the airport, the library, 
the museum, the streets that lead to the jobs where

29:41.197 --> 29:55.112
people work. and philosophically george 
mitchell felt that the city of houston needed to

29:55.987 --> 30:25.926
have the ability to continue to annex land and grow 
as it could provide services for those areas so by

29:55.987 --> 30:25.926
contract the woodlands is included in etj it was 
not it was not geographically situated to be

29:55.987 --> 30:25.926
included in etj but by contract it is now included 
in etj isn't that I mean, a lot of what you said, you

30:27.155 --> 30:31.819
know, were you to go, well, one, does the community 
in fact know that? Yes. They do know that? Isn't

30:33.881 --> 30:38.546
that then a potential source of some grievous 
conflict in the future? Yes. Which means, I mean,

30:41.068 --> 30:44.772
what's going to happen? Well,

30:44.792 --> 30:57.043
right now the approach, and I think the realistic 
response is that nothing is going to happen for a

30:44.792 --> 30:57.043
period of time. city of houston is not going to 
annex it with them for a period of time you know

30:58.829 --> 31:26.136
likelihood yeah it's a sleeping dog that's going 
to wake up well it slept in a place called clear lake

30:58.829 --> 31:26.136
city until the residents there challenged the 
system and under state law an area can if it wants to

30:58.829 --> 31:26.136
separately incorporate it first has to ask the 
city in whose etj it resides to annex them and if the

31:27.128 --> 31:55.549
city refuses to do that then they can incorporate 
the clear lake city asked the question and they

31:27.128 --> 31:55.549
were annexed into the city of houston and that was 
not a pleasant set of circumstances existed for a

31:27.128 --> 31:55.549
number of years as you look around houston every 
major large-scale community is in etj in the city

31:27.128 --> 31:55.549
of houston it's not unique to the woodland no i know 
so wherever you uh around the city of Houston,

31:56.069 --> 32:00.354
you're faced with the same issue. So it's not a 
unique Woodlands question. It's a regional

32:02.957 --> 32:06.722
issue. But the distinction is, I mean, forgive me, 
but the distinction is those communities,

32:07.343 --> 32:18.937
this is a corporation running a community. That 
isn't happening. Kingwood is, too. Oh, is it? Fair

32:22.601 --> 32:24.183
Lake City is, too. Because what I would... you 
know, at least there'd be a nagging headache in the

32:27.743 --> 32:39.334
back of my skull that at some point, instead of 
animosity being turned toward the city of Houston

32:27.743 --> 32:39.334
or some other place, that I'm going to catch it in my 
lap, you know. Well, under the community

32:39.434 --> 32:57.430
association that we have here, it's a 
representative form of government that

32:39.434 --> 32:57.430
residents elect representatives to serve on 
their behalf on the board of directors that

32:39.434 --> 32:57.430
addresses all the municipal services and charges 
for those services that the scope of delivering

32:57.916 --> 33:23.890
those services and in fact in 1992 the residents 
will control that wca board the community

32:57.916 --> 33:23.890
association board and the developer will no 
longer control that one so it's not that the

32:57.916 --> 33:23.890
corporation controls the community uh the 
residents will control the community you're in

32:57.916 --> 33:23.890
the middle of that transfer right now yeah right 
that was my second question we're in the

32:57.916 --> 33:23.890
transition that takes place in 1992 and We're 
trying to go through the discussion of trying to

33:24.190 --> 33:33.502
prepare the community for that happening. And 
right now, frankly, there is some confusion. It's

33:37.607 --> 33:38.849
a complicated issue. Most people don't think 
about it day to day. It's not something they deal

33:42.293 --> 33:43.415
with. And then when confronted with the notion 
that something's going to happen, the natural

33:43.955 --> 33:51.565
reaction is, if it's changing, I need to be 
concerned about it. And then they try to learn

33:51.983 --> 33:55.128
quickly what they need to be concerned about. And 
we're going through a very lengthy educational

33:55.689 --> 34:03.000
process now to make sure they don't misunderstand 
that we're the bad guys. Sure. That was my other

34:05.243 --> 34:06.325
question. As the privatization of city 
management or government proceeds, what's your

34:06.565 --> 34:14.036
role? How will you continue to influence or affect 
the quality of life issues, the infrastructure,

34:14.116 --> 34:21.147
the that you've worked so hard to establish. Well, 
we hope we put in place a framework with respect to

34:24.584 --> 34:32.876
those areas already developed that will last long 
after the development is gone. That was the, I

34:33.157 --> 34:37.663
don't like the word scheme, that was the concept. 
To put in place a form of quasi-government.

34:44.273 --> 34:47.617
Residents would run, control, operate, and take 
care of their own needs. Our intent is not to be here

34:48.619 --> 34:50.762
forever. probably seems that we will be. We'll be 
here for a long time. But in 1992, when this first

34:55.998 --> 35:15.419
community association control transfers to the 
residents, a second community association will

34:55.998 --> 35:15.419
be formed to carry out the development mission on 
lands not yet developed. So we will, in essence,

35:15.439 --> 35:16.861
control. We'll have the capacity to control the 
undeveloped lands. with respect to lands already

35:21.640 --> 35:27.445
developed, the residents will control that. So 
there's a transfer of control with respect to

35:27.465 --> 35:32.270
what's already been done. In terms of residential 
development, you're about halfway where you

35:32.290 --> 35:37.094
anticipate being? No. No, we've got 30,000 people 
live here, 150,000. 150,000, you're assuming.

35:42.779 --> 35:43.940
No, whatever percent that is. You've got a lot to 
do. 20% somewhere. But it's an accelerating pace.

35:51.458 --> 35:58.367
And if we don't have eight years of economic 
hardship, maybe we'll move along faster. We're 16

35:58.828 --> 36:03.294
years old, and we've been in the doldrums eight of 
those 16 years. So I think our progress has been, I

36:03.394 --> 36:08.421
think, surprisingly good, considering what's 
happening. Well, I think you're right. I think

36:10.824 --> 36:12.146
you're right. You know, the rest of the country has 
been in college stations. You've still been

36:15.290 --> 36:16.492
pretty active. Let me ask one last question, and 
then I'll shut up. And you may find this

36:19.295 --> 36:20.537
impertinent. But it's something that I wondered 
about as I talked with Mr. Richmond, Mr. Brown, and

36:20.821 --> 36:28.393
now you. What would happen to the Woodlands if 
George Mitchell died tomorrow? Well, the

36:35.144 --> 36:42.074
Woodlands Corporation is a wholly owned 
subsidiary of a public corporation. George, in

36:42.155 --> 36:46.862
fact, owns 62% of the stock of that corporation, 
but it is publicly held. and will have an ongoing

36:47.365 --> 36:52.933
life should something unfortunate happen to Mr. 
Mitchell. I'm not privy to how his estate would be

36:52.953 --> 36:59.743
managed. I would expect that a great portion of it 
probably would go into a foundation. And I would

37:04.931 --> 37:09.438
not expect any great changes over the short term. 
Over a longer period of time, I don't guess I would

37:09.458 --> 37:16.208
be capable of addressing that. But there's enough 
framework in the Woodlands, just talking about

37:16.795 --> 37:24.662
the Woodlands itself and the community of the 
Woodlands. There's enough framework here

37:24.682 --> 37:37.954
already in place and enough initiatives in place, 
and it's a market that vitality has been

37:24.682 --> 37:37.954
established to the point where I think it could 
have an ongoing life beyond this commission. You

37:37.974 --> 37:45.060
feel that the strategic plans you've developed 
and the machinery of those are going to continue on

37:37.974 --> 37:45.060
regardless? Yeah. There may be some modification 
to it, but I come back to the earlier statements.

37:51.853 --> 38:00.942
What we try to do is build fabric in the community 
that gives the community ongoing life and set into

37:51.853 --> 38:00.942
place some institutions that have a life of its 
own. And it will be a viable community. You know, a

38:05.067 --> 38:08.791
town of 30,000 people is not a small town. And it's 
got a lot of elements in it that are necessary to

38:08.811 --> 38:14.697
make it function, even if it's leading up others. 
By 1992, basically, the Woodlands Corporation

38:14.997 --> 38:24.849
would be another business located in the 
Woodlands City, I'd say, in the transfer

38:14.997 --> 38:24.849
authority. Except that they'll still be 
developing. They'll still be developing. We're

38:27.852 --> 38:29.314
going to continue to develop. In 1992, you won't be 
able to tell any difference visually if you drive

38:29.394 --> 38:33.879
in here. And if you live here, you probably won't 
notice any difference either. Legally, there

38:39.345 --> 38:41.528
will be some changes that take place. But I think 
with respect to the development concept, the

38:42.065 --> 38:56.545
quality of what we're doing, the pace at which 
we're doing it, the way it's financed, there'll be

38:42.065 --> 38:56.545
little or no change to that. Well, good. We 
probably shouldn't have put it on the board. Well,

38:59.328 --> 39:00.450
we haven't written that position. I like to talk 
about the Woodlands. Well, it's exciting. Yeah,

39:03.995 --> 39:07.359
it's a unique opportunity, a unique place. It's 
nice to have a sense of pride in what you're doing. I

39:13.452 --> 39:22.885
guess the most satisfying things I can do is not sit 
here in the office, but occasionally on the

39:13.452 --> 39:22.885
weekend drive around and see what's happening. I 
mean, it's kind of impressive when you get out and

39:22.905 --> 39:26.590
look at all the things that have happened. And we 
got caught up in the fires like anyone else.

39:29.514 --> 39:32.357
There's a crisis today or a crisis tomorrow. We 
addressed that, and we'd like to think we always

39:32.578 --> 39:42.531
have a long-range vision, but in truth and in fact, 
you have daily things that you need to do. It's nice

39:43.237 --> 39:50.324
to back away occasionally and reflect on what has 
happened and what can't happen. And we've got a

39:50.344 --> 39:52.787
staff of people who have been here a long time. That 
was my next question. How do you work? Do you have

39:55.029 --> 39:56.611
staff meetings regularly? Yeah, we have staff 
meetings and planning meetings and meetings on

39:56.631 --> 40:02.657
special issues. But most of our employees have 
been with us 10, 15 years and been working together

40:03.358 --> 40:10.605
as a team for that period of time. We don't have a lot 
of turnover. And you don't have to have quite as

40:13.831 --> 40:18.736
many meetings when people have been around that 
long. Everyone knows what they need to do and

40:19.857 --> 40:24.361
what's expected of them. But in managing this 
process, we have a staff meeting once a week where

40:24.381 --> 40:40.716
our key managers get together and talk about the 
issues and try to stay away from numbers and

40:24.381 --> 40:40.716
details, but look at the big picture. Then we have 
specific planning meetings in the residential

40:41.050 --> 40:53.308
communities and also in the commercial and retail 
areas. We have staff groups. Jack provides

40:56.653 --> 41:02.661
advertising and VR services to the operating 
units. Each operating unit doesn't have an

41:02.681 --> 41:06.507
advertising and VR person. We have centralized 
engineering and construction group. We have a

41:10.160 --> 41:14.366
centralized land planning group.

41:16.690 --> 41:21.157
We have a centralized legal, accounting, 
financial services. And then we have essentially

41:21.177 --> 41:24.682
three operating groups. We have a residential 
group, a commercial industrial group, and we have

41:24.782 --> 41:32.955
a hospitality group. Those are the three 
components of the Woodlands community. And then

41:35.759 --> 41:36.420
we have Another group that we call Mitchell 
Southwest that takes care of all the properties

41:36.772 --> 41:43.719
not in the woods, in Galveston Island. We own 
40,000 acres of timberland between here and

41:44.300 --> 41:49.685
College Station.

41:51.367 --> 41:56.432
We have resort properties on Galveston, on Lake 
Travis, Lake Livingston. And that's taken care of

41:56.452 --> 41:59.274
by a separate group. That's a good summary. The 
stuff that Mr. Mitchell does, The restoration

42:04.160 --> 42:07.564
stuff, I'm guessing. No, we provide the technical 
services. That's all his money, all his

42:11.229 --> 42:14.313
initiative. We have a couple architects that work 
in our planning group that help him select

42:15.694 --> 42:26.968
architects, especially trained in renovation 
work. We oversee some of the construction for him,

42:26.988 --> 42:33.036
and we are reimbursed on a time basis for the work we 
provide for him. That's basically like a

42:33.252 --> 42:35.875
contractual contract. Yeah, right. But you 
are—you are doing the—what's not pirates—what's

42:36.976 --> 42:43.523
the point? Point Venture? No, down at the office. 
Pirates— Pirates Beach and Cove? Yeah. Yeah,

42:48.628 --> 42:51.632
that's our— And there's new activity there, 
right? Yeah, right. Right. Several kinds of new

42:53.273 --> 42:54.575
activity. One, we're developing part of it, and 
we're in the courthouse on part of it, so— We've

42:58.126 --> 43:04.415
been trying to get approval to develop one little 
parcel down there for 16 years now. And it's caught

43:05.156 --> 43:14.209
up in emotion and environment and local politics. 
Well, we sure appreciate your time. Well, thanks

43:16.051 --> 43:17.273
for coming by. It's really been a good time. I look 
forward to seeing what work product you produce

43:18.374 --> 43:21.619
here. We will too, yeah. What is your time frame 
for? Really about six months.
