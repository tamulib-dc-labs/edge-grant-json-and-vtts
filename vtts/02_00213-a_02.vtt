00:04.553 --> 00:08.959
So that first semester went well, and your grades 
came out okay? About a three, four. Three, four.

00:11.502 --> 00:13.945
Did you have a goal that you were shooting for? 
That, I mean, I didn't really, I knew I wanted to do

00:15.527 --> 00:23.598
well, but I knew I didn't want to, I didn't want my 
only thing at A&M to be my grades. I knew that. As you

00:25.040 --> 00:32.670
began to try to look further into the future, who 
did you turn to for advice? A man named Dr. Ben

00:32.819 --> 00:34.321
Welch. I don't know if you've heard his name at all. 
At the time he was in charge of the fellows program

00:37.186 --> 00:42.615
in the School of Business. He is Aggie Men's Club 
advisor. An absolutely amazing man. Probably the

00:46.661 --> 00:51.249
man in which I've learned most of at this, since 
I've been here. Dr. Welch. What made him a good

00:54.774 --> 00:57.679
advisor? his genuine love of A&M and genuine love 
of the group in which I was involved in I mean like he

00:58.722 --> 01:24.915
loves Aggie Men's Club and he loves Texas A&M and it 
was just very obvious that he did that and he was

00:58.722 --> 01:24.915
just he's a very caring individual he takes the 
time to give you a hug he takes the time to see how

00:58.722 --> 01:24.915
you're doing which is great and so it was just very 
easy to talk to him did While you were getting very

01:25.267 --> 01:34.465
much involved and attached, were you aware of 
other freshmen who were just kind of getting left

01:25.267 --> 01:34.465
out? I was. My roommate was one of them. Is that 
right? My roommate was one of them. What could have

01:38.252 --> 01:40.637
been done in hindsight? What could I have done or 
what could they have done? What could A&M have done

01:43.503 --> 01:45.807
or what could they have done? I think a big part of my 
roommate was the fact that he played football,

01:46.630 --> 01:53.197
which is such a big time commitment, and he just 
didn't enjoy it. He just wasn't enjoying himself

01:53.357 --> 01:58.263
because walk-ons don't get a fair shake at the 
school. And so he was getting really frustrated

01:58.804 --> 02:06.072
with the fact that he was going out there four hours 
a day and nothing was really coming of it. But as far

02:08.775 --> 02:10.056
as I think... He didn't even go to MSC open house. He 
didn't try. He didn't put forth the effort. And at

02:17.302 --> 02:20.289
A&M, you have to put forth the effort a little bit if 
it's going to get. I mean, it's just like anything

02:20.309 --> 02:21.412
else. And so him not putting forth the effort kind 
of doomed him for the rest of it. And he ended up

02:26.364 --> 02:28.990
transferring after his freshman year. All right. 
But you stayed the whole semester, the whole year

02:30.459 --> 02:33.643
in Cane. I did. As you go home Christmas, you feel 
good about the first semester. I do. I feel very

02:38.909 --> 02:39.971
good about the first semester. Now, what does an 
Aggie do for four weeks in the semester break? Hang

02:46.118 --> 02:48.281
out with high school friends and go skiing. I 
remember I went skiing. I went skiing with some of

02:50.103 --> 02:54.488
my high school friends actually. and then just 
hung out with them. And did you tell them anything

02:56.521 --> 02:58.746
about A&M? Oh, yeah, if they had listened. But a lot 
of them wouldn't listen. There was, out of the 73

03:02.815 --> 03:06.643
people that graduated from my high school, 21 of 
them came to A&M. Really? So...

03:12.220 --> 03:24.630
So your second semester you dug in more deeply and 
did you start looking around for a specific major?

03:24.991 --> 03:26.635
A little bit I did. I had heard that the College of 
Business was starting to put requirements on GPA

03:27.796 --> 03:34.583
requirements, which I was fine just as far as that 
goes. But I started looking towards business

03:35.144 --> 03:39.649
simply because I enjoyed history a lot. I remember 
talking to my parents about history. I had a great,

03:41.191 --> 03:42.873
great class. Probably one of the better classes 
I've taken. It was History 106. Its name was Arnie

03:45.455 --> 03:46.757
Kramer. Loved that class. Loved Mr. Kramer. We 
ended up becoming relatively good friends. I

03:53.665 --> 03:55.386
stopped by his office every once in a while. We just 
became... very close and I really enjoyed his

03:57.749 --> 04:00.157
teaching method. I know him well, but what made him 
outstanding? His love for what he was doing.

04:07.553 --> 04:36.244
honestly it was just very obvious that he really 
enjoyed not only history but also teaching

04:07.553 --> 04:36.244
students about it and he took it very seriously and 
he rewarded students in the right way of rewarding

04:07.553 --> 04:36.244
students you know it wasn't just he didn't reward 
students just by going okay good job like if you

04:07.553 --> 04:36.244
came to class you got rewarded for it if you did 
extra credit you got rewarded for it the tests were

04:07.553 --> 04:36.244
a combination of having to know facts but also just 
using your mind as well And also, he just made it

04:36.224 --> 04:37.966
fun, you know. He threw in little, at least for me, 
who can't think on one subject forever. It was a

04:43.074 --> 04:45.397
Tuesday, Thursday class, and so it was an hour and a 
half long. He would throw in random stuff. I mean,

04:47.380 --> 04:50.244
he's always big on word origins, and he's really 
big on that type of stuff. And so, he would throw in

04:50.284 --> 04:54.050
stuff that would keep your interest going. And 
just, I loved going by his office hours. We always

04:57.995 --> 05:03.463
had such great conversations, and we ended up 
actually going to lunch a couple times, and it was

04:57.995 --> 05:03.463
just really neat. Did you know anything about his 
background? I did once the semester started

05:06.907 --> 05:12.634
progressing just as far as what he did as far as the 
civil rights and stuff like that. No, I'm meaning

05:12.654 --> 05:14.516
his grandparents. No, I don't. One of his 
grandfathers or great-grandfathers was the

05:15.257 --> 05:19.943
chief rabbi in Budapest. His father or 
grandfather immigrated over here, worked about

05:21.665 --> 05:31.797
eight years, goes back, says to the synagogue 
congregation, I'm looking for a wife. And one of

05:31.928 --> 05:34.373
the families said, here she is. They get married 
and come back to the Chicago area. And he grew up

05:41.347 --> 05:46.478
learning to speak Magyar Yiddish English And 
German. And so, and many of his relatives were

05:49.088 --> 05:54.215
involved in the Holocaust and all like that. Oh, 
yeah. So he had firsthand experience in that. The,

05:58.620 --> 06:03.526
in general, that freshman year, were the 
instructors good? I was relatively blessed with

06:04.127 --> 06:06.610
my instructors. I remember second semester 
freshman year having one that I didn't really care

06:06.630 --> 06:09.734
for. He was my oceanography professor. It was much 
like I was a number. And he just came in, said his

06:15.007 --> 06:17.111
stuff, and then left. He was never really at his 
office hours, very distant, very big on research.

06:21.621 --> 06:26.893
And that's one thing that I kind of, I think any time 
you get a university professor, A lot of them think

06:28.038 --> 06:36.187
that their main job is research rather than 
teaching, which I don't agree with, but I guess

06:28.038 --> 06:36.187
they're open to do whatever they want. But that 
kind of frustrates me sometimes. If you want to be a

06:38.009 --> 06:41.352
researcher, then go work for a research company. 
Don't act like you're a professor. Now, did you

06:43.895 --> 06:46.678
zero in on business eventually? For a while. Oh, 
okay. For a while. My major is not business. I did

06:51.443 --> 06:52.424
zero in on business. I became a business major 
beginning of my sophomore year. Yeah, beginning

06:56.962 --> 06:58.826
of my sophomore year I became a business major. 
Alright, then that second semester though you had

06:58.866 --> 07:04.057
more into student activities. Were there any that 
you added that? I didn't get in any. Other than fish

07:10.650 --> 07:11.973
camp. I got fish camp. It's funny, people ask me, 
they're like, well, how has your college career

07:14.933 --> 07:18.839
been so successful? Like everything you've done, 
it seems like you've touched his turn to gold and

07:19.420 --> 07:26.850
all this kind of stuff, just as far as the elections 
I've won and stuff like that. But I've been denied

07:28.693 --> 07:33.540
more than I've been accepted at A&M to 
organizations. I tried out for four

07:33.580 --> 07:37.005
organizations first semester of my freshman 
year, got into one. Tried out for four more second

07:37.466 --> 07:40.350
semester, got into one. I applied to eight my 
sophomore year, got into three. So I've

07:44.196 --> 07:49.604
definitely tried stuff, but just, I mean, don't 
get into everything. As you look back on those

07:49.785 --> 07:57.617
successes and lack thereof, do you think that the 
process was relatively fair? Oh, definitely.

08:00.461 --> 08:02.284
Some of the stuff kind of frustrates me. It's kind 
of like a catch-22 situation. I guess I'm a theater

08:04.107 --> 08:31.245
arts major and so I'm trying to get into theater 
obviously and the problem with theater is that

08:04.107 --> 08:31.245
it's kind of an inclusive group that if you don't 
know someone or if you aren't already in the group

08:04.107 --> 08:31.245
then they aren't going to let you do anything but 
you can't do anything unless you're in the group

08:04.107 --> 08:31.245
and so it's kind of a catch-22 well student 
government is much the same way if you don't know

08:04.107 --> 08:31.245
someone then it's very hard to get involved but yet 
they want to involve more people and so it's this

08:04.107 --> 08:31.245
kind of this dichotomy of mission I guess and so I 
guess if I could change anything it'd be a lot of

08:04.107 --> 08:31.245
that What about the MSC and all its activities? I 
didn't know about the MSC, to be honest with you. I

08:36.610 --> 08:37.591
knew about the MSC. I was in the MSC all the time, but 
I didn't know about all the organizations. I heard

08:40.754 --> 08:43.697
about MSC Hospitality, and I heard about MSC Opus. 
But other than that, I really didn't know about

08:44.218 --> 08:46.020
anything. I didn't know about Town Hall. I wish 
there was some freshman organizations that I

08:47.581 --> 08:51.986
could have gotten involved in that are here in the 
MSC that are housed here. There's just a lot of

08:52.586 --> 08:54.248
stuff that I didn't know about. I was gone for 17 
years, and one of my shocks when I came back was that

08:54.688 --> 08:59.393
SCONA is very little today. It was one of the 
grandest activities on the campus. It was big.

09:06.629 --> 09:12.799
They were raising $40,000, $50,000 per year 
themselves as students in the 60s. Wow. Let's see.

09:17.446 --> 09:21.773
Then did you say you eventually ended up as a 
theater arts major? Yes. When did you? Second

09:23.717 --> 09:25.419
semester of my sophomore year. Okay. All right. 
You finished the first year. Your grades were

09:29.185 --> 09:30.227
okay. What did you do that summer? I interned at my 
church. I got a job. I got a job and went, and

09:34.793 --> 09:39.385
something that college students, many college 
students do, you walk through the M.I.C. and get a

09:39.406 --> 09:41.057
gooder credit card. So you get a credit card and 
you're just like, wow, this is easy to spend. And so

09:44.099 --> 09:47.963
I racked up a, not a huge debt, but a couple hundred 
dollars in debt. And I was just like, oh my gosh,

09:48.724 --> 09:50.045
can't do this. So I went back that summer. I 
interned at my church and I just paid that off. Just

09:53.408 --> 09:54.189
had a really fun time. I was involved in fish camp, 
hung out with some high school friends, really did

09:54.209 --> 09:57.132
some neat stuff. Just as far as hanging out with my 
parents, went on some fun trips with some high

09:57.152 --> 10:00.415
school friends. Like we went to New York, some 
friends of mine, about six of us, we went to New York

10:01.216 --> 10:07.602
and just stayed for a week. And then just came back 
for fish camp. And so that summer was really just

10:09.745 --> 10:13.049
kind of a time away, I guess. Did you do any 
introspection after the first year in

10:13.189 --> 10:18.095
preparation for the second? Oh, yeah. What did you 
decide you were going to modify or change? My

10:23.582 --> 10:26.085
involvement level in A&M. My involvement level in 
my friends had been very high my freshman year just

10:26.125 --> 10:34.095
as far as pouring myself into, for instance, Aggie 
Men's Club and the friends that went in that. I did

10:34.700 --> 10:38.828
some, I felt that I represented myself really well 
my freshman year. And so then that summer I was, I

10:40.873 --> 10:48.608
just really was like, okay, I started thinking 
about the Yale leader thing again, simply because

10:40.873 --> 10:48.608
you run at the end of your sophomore year. So that 
was something that was on my mind a little bit. I

10:52.737 --> 10:55.763
hadn't decided that I was going to do it yet. but it 
was on my mind. And so I came back to school and I just

10:57.085 --> 11:00.010
got really involved with stuff. I was living in a 
house off campus with some friends. I lived with

11:02.073 --> 11:03.796
some seniors, which was really neat. It was my best 
friend and myself that I made here. We didn't know

11:07.542 --> 11:09.264
each other before we got to A&M. He and I lived with 
four other seniors, graduating seniors. So it was

11:12.930 --> 11:14.713
really neat. to see a 22-year-old in college as an 
18-year-old, you know. As a 19-year-old, you got

11:19.341 --> 11:25.432
to see a 22-year-old, which was just such an 
amazing learning experience, which was really

11:19.341 --> 11:25.432
neat. Alright, now describe the daily class, the 
class day routine then. Living off campus in a

11:30.185 --> 11:35.612
house, what time did y'all get up, what time did you 
do this or that? I guess it was very dependent upon

11:35.672 --> 11:40.137
what time my class started. I really can't 
remember what my exact schedule was. I remember I

11:42.320 --> 11:45.103
didn't have any 8 o'clock's my sophomore year, 
which is really good. But off campus parking is

11:45.684 --> 11:56.817
obviously a hassle, so I got a bike and I got a little 
trailer hitch that went on my little Blazer that I

11:45.684 --> 11:56.817
could put my bike on there and I'd go and I'd park out 
at Reed Arena and then ride my bike all over campus.

11:57.843 --> 11:59.326
which is great and it worked fine. The thing that 
makes me laugh about it is that all these people

11:59.807 --> 12:03.796
complain about parking. All these people 
complain about all this stuff. And I'm like, it's

12:05.680 --> 12:07.484
because you're lazy. I was like, there's always a 
parking spot at Reed Arena. Always, 24 hours a day.

12:11.573 --> 12:13.838
If you want to go park there and just get on the bus, 
then you're fine. But all these people want...

12:15.241 --> 12:19.108
parking to be right next to the classroom, which 
isn't going to happen. Makes me laugh. I think the

12:20.150 --> 12:26.622
student body is very apathetic as far as wanting to 
do something for themselves about problems other

12:20.150 --> 12:26.622
than just sitting around complaining. And I've 
learned that this past year as far as just in the

12:27.082 --> 12:31.570
leadership role that I've been in and the 
committees I've been on. I'm kind of frustrated

12:32.652 --> 12:35.798
with the student body sometimes.

12:37.330 --> 12:40.354
Now, what would you, you'd come to the campus and 
stay all day? Pretty much, just simply because,

12:40.795 --> 12:46.863
well, I'd come for at least a little bit, but I would 
have meetings at night, so I'd go home and I'd have

12:40.795 --> 12:46.863
to change for meetings. But when you parked at Reed 
Arena, got on your bike, what did you bring with you

12:47.184 --> 12:51.910
to campus? Just my books and my day planner and my 
wallet, I guess. Backpack? Backpack, yes, there

12:56.937 --> 12:58.319
would be a backpack. And any stories about bike? 
Oh, sure, bike collisions all the time. I mean,

13:04.617 --> 13:05.840
they were a weekly occurrence. They just 
happened. Sometimes cars, sometimes people, but

13:07.323 --> 13:11.833
sometimes you'd try and hop a curb and not do it and 
you'd fall. Ever get hurt? Not too bad. Not too bad.

13:15.340 --> 13:16.944
I mean, I'd skin an knee and skin an elbow. Bike 
theft, ever? Yes, twice. Two bikes got stolen.

13:22.275 --> 13:22.917
Didn't get it back? No, didn't get it back. Didn't 
get it back. Was this unusual, or did other people

13:27.037 --> 13:29.320
have the same? Bike theft is very commonplace, 
yeah. I didn't know that. Yeah, bike theft is

13:32.826 --> 13:35.491
enormous on this campus. Does anybody know what it 
is? Does somebody else just steal it and use it? I

13:40.018 --> 13:40.379
don't know. I honestly don't know. Did you ever 
see, think you saw it? Yes. Oh, yeah. I thought I'd

13:45.046 --> 13:45.747
saw it. I thought I'd see it, and I'd run after them, 
and they'd be gone. Wow. Alright, so you'd come,

13:49.994 --> 13:54.321
where'd you eat lunch then? MSC, again, simply 
because I didn't have on-campus dining and so I

13:54.721 --> 13:58.788
just ate at Aggie Bucks. With a group or anything? 
With my friends, just with my friends that would be

13:59.689 --> 14:02.013
there. Or I'd, yeah, I'd eat in the 12th Man a whole 
lot. Alright, then in the afternoons when you had

14:07.261 --> 14:10.606
free time, where'd you go? I'd go home. I remember 
I'd work out. I'd go to the rec center maybe. I'd go

14:14.710 --> 14:16.852
over to another friend's house, but then I'd go 
home. My house was one. It was very big. Turn of the

14:18.695 --> 14:20.497
century colonial house. Plantation house out in 
Bryan by downtown Bryan. You know the Kyle house?

14:24.722 --> 14:25.964
Right across the street from the Kyle house. It was 
on Finnfeather. Well, you know how Finnfeather

14:27.345 --> 14:29.428
turns and it becomes something else? Well, it 
picks up again right there. And I lived right on

14:31.891 --> 14:33.173
that street. And just huge house, four bedroom. We 
had six guys living there. And it was just... So all

14:39.100 --> 14:40.946
their friends were coming over all the time. So the 
house was a really neat place that we'd go to bed at 4

14:40.966 --> 14:43.875
o'clock every day. How did you all in that house, 
how did you all divvy up the food. Who bought what

14:51.211 --> 14:52.993
groceries? Who cooked? We said we each had a 
cabinet and so just as far as snacks and stuff goes,

14:54.235 --> 15:05.311
you're in charge of that yourself, but as milk, 
eggs, stuff that goes in the refrigerator, meat,

14:54.235 --> 15:05.311
that's kind of community. And it was just kind of up 
to the honor of the person to go get more. Did you

15:09.577 --> 15:10.358
cook your own? Sometimes. relatively everybody 
played to the rules? Yeah, it was a really good

15:14.944 --> 15:16.747
thing. One of the great things about my freshman 
year is we had something called family dinner,

15:16.787 --> 15:22.594
which was every Monday night we'd eat dinner 
together. And it would rotate. We had a schedule.

15:25.758 --> 15:30.304
Either someone would cook or you'd take everyone 
out to dinner for the whole house. And so it was

15:30.504 --> 15:37.052
really neat just simply because that was a weekly 
event in which we got together even if we were

15:30.504 --> 15:37.052
really busy and just kind of talked. And then that 
fall of your sophomore year, bonfire again? What

15:41.858 --> 15:43.099
was your task? I lived off campus, so it was a lot 
harder to get involved with bonfire. I went to cut

15:47.124 --> 15:48.405
three times, I think. I went to father-son cut. 
Where was the cut area that year? Snook the first

15:54.532 --> 15:55.674
year, where? It was...

16:01.450 --> 16:03.754
I think it was Snook again, just a different part of 
Snook. I remember the road where you turned off to

16:04.235 --> 16:10.146
get to it, but I don't remember how to get to that 
specific place. So that's the fall of 98. Fall of

16:15.195 --> 16:15.976
98, yes. Did you or any of your buddies ever talk 
about danger, worries

16:15.996 --> 16:24.171
about Bonfire? Oh, sure. At Cutside, I remember 
one time we got out there and it was wet that

16:25.379 --> 16:29.723
morning. So we were cutting and a friend of mine who 
has never wielded an axe before got it and swung and

16:30.124 --> 16:41.254
missed right by two people's heads. So it was 
plainly obvious.

16:47.680 --> 16:52.585
For those of you working in the cut area, you all 
were entirely separate from the stackers. No, you

16:53.155 --> 16:54.337
can do both. You can do both. Did many do both? Most 
people did both. Most people did both. Something

16:58.803 --> 17:01.566
because stack didn't start until cutting was 
done. What would be your guess as to how many people

17:02.608 --> 17:09.277
actually participated in bonfire during those 
years? Cutting, stacking? No, do you say going out

17:11.660 --> 17:16.046
once or do you say heavily involved? No. 5,000? 
4,000 went once. As far as the dedicated crew of

17:21.412 --> 17:24.295
people that would build it, 250. And

17:24.335 --> 17:29.159
were they civilian or corps? It was both. What 
would be? Half and half. Half and half? Maybe a

17:32.582 --> 17:36.466
little more civilian simply because there's more 
people that are civilian. Were there any women in

17:36.826 --> 17:38.568
the cut area? Yes. What were they doing? Some were 
cutting but most of them they were the water people

17:40.650 --> 17:45.994
that drive around in a truck with the water and with 
the lunches and stuff like that. Did you and the

17:46.014 --> 17:48.056
other guys make fun of them or anything? No. And 
were there some women at the stack area? Yes, there

17:52.413 --> 17:53.855
were. And they got made fun of. They what? They got 
made fun of. They did? But they had the cookie shack

17:57.039 --> 17:59.362
also out at the cut site. I mean, out at the stack 
site.

18:03.807 --> 18:05.009
When did you first go to muster? Freshman year. It 
was the first one in Reed Arena. What did you think

18:08.813 --> 18:09.634
about it? Blown away. I remember I just, I went home 
and just sat by myself for like three hours after

18:10.876 --> 18:14.320
it. I mean, I just, it was really hard to 
comprehend, you know. It was great. A year ago I did

18:20.872 --> 18:47.098
the muster, my 25th muster speech at Albuquerque 
and before they called the roll, a young man from

18:20.872 --> 18:47.098
Albuquerque came up and he was either a sophomore 
or a junior and his squad was on duty at the stack

18:20.872 --> 18:47.098
when the collapse came and his outfit, he unfurled 
his outfit banner which had gotten torn and there

18:20.872 --> 18:47.098
was a blood stain on it. That was, that was 
touching. Then Mrs. Curley, I was president at UT

18:51.117 --> 19:07.014
El Paso when I left here and we still have an Aggie 
daughter and granddaughter and grandson and a

18:51.117 --> 19:07.014
son-in-law out there and Mr. and Mrs. Curley were 
the I know that actually, I'm relatively close

18:51.117 --> 19:07.014
with the Curleys. Are you? Yeah, I am. I'm a Fish 
Camp co-chair and they are namesake and so we're

19:08.616 --> 19:12.360
Camp Curley.

19:16.559 --> 19:17.020
in there. I haven't read it all yet. Very, very, 
very touching. Very touching. Oh, my. Let's see.

19:24.258 --> 19:24.619
Muster. Why was Muster touching? Just because it 
was packed. 15,000 people were there. For what?

19:32.149 --> 19:32.430
Why? I'm a big person. I question people's 
motivation for stuff. I don't question it as far as

19:37.317 --> 19:39.621
is it real or not. But I ask the question why a lot. 
I'm a big why person. Why do you do what you do? Why do

19:44.649 --> 19:45.550
you say what you do? And so I was just like, okay, all 
these people are here. Why? Why are these people

19:48.855 --> 19:49.657
here? What is the answer then? Why were they there? 
A&M. A&M. Why this devotion? Something that human

19:58.392 --> 20:04.079
beings need is a sense of self within a bigger 
conglomerate, in my opinion. You always need to be

20:04.099 --> 20:06.502
involved in something bigger than yourself. I 
think that's why Bonfire had such a bigger feel to

20:06.562 --> 20:12.951
it because it felt like you were working not only on 
something now, but you were upholding something

20:06.562 --> 20:12.951
in the past. And that's what A&M is. A&M is 
believing in yourself and investing in the now to

20:15.294 --> 20:20.520
build for the future, remembering the past. And so 
that is what in my opinion muster is muster is

20:24.177 --> 20:43.266
something where you come not for yourself you're 
not getting anything out of that sure the muster

20:24.177 --> 20:43.266
speaker might say something where you go wow 
that's really cool but you're not going to learn

20:24.177 --> 20:43.266
anything about life there you go to show support 
for those families that are sitting on the floor

20:24.177 --> 20:43.266
you go to show support for a m you go to be there I tell 
them that those words in the song, there is a spirit

20:44.073 --> 20:48.096
which can never be told. You can't really describe 
it. You can't. You got to feel it. You do have to feel

20:50.539 --> 20:51.319
it. And it took some of us outsiders a while to 
understand that. Now you went to some athletic

20:56.023 --> 21:02.269
events in G. Raleigh. What was it like over there? 
It was fun. Basketball games were different. Now

21:08.314 --> 21:12.898
no one went to basketball games my freshman year 
simply because we were horrible. And see, when I

21:13.537 --> 21:17.682
left here in 1980, you couldn't get a ticket. It was 
packed. It was called the Holler House because the

21:18.683 --> 21:25.452
opposition knew that was going to be a tough place 
to play. I'm so mad about athletics right now. For

21:30.999 --> 21:41.552
you as a freshman or sophomore, what were the other 
key events that you and your buddies included in

21:30.999 --> 21:41.552
your calendar? Our back porch, we had an enormous 
back porch at my house. And hours upon hours upon

21:45.403 --> 21:50.031
hours were spent on the back porch playing the 
guitar, singing, hanging out. Just hours.

21:52.555 --> 21:57.503
Hanging out, that was definitely my coming to age 
as far as socially goes. Just as far as going out or

21:58.485 --> 22:02.331
having friends over or staying up until dawn, just 
doing nothing. Did y'all, as a little community,

22:03.172 --> 22:08.080
did you ever counsel each other? Mm-hmm. Oh, sure. 
My roommate got engaged that week, that semester.

22:13.670 --> 22:15.452
Actually, the spring semester myself. Did anyone 
ever say to anyone else, hey, you ought not do that?

22:18.456 --> 22:18.737
Oh, yeah. Yeah, accountability was a big part of 
our house. All right. Did you attend any religious

22:24.765 --> 22:26.587
services here? I did. Where? I went to breakaway 
every Tuesday. It wasn't on campus at that point.

22:31.568 --> 22:34.394
It was still over at Central Baptist Church in 
Bryan. But I went to Breakaway almost weekly. What

22:37.440 --> 22:38.683
was special about Breakaway? The numbers, 
honestly. And the speaker, Greg Mott, I don't know

22:42.751 --> 22:50.166
if you've ever heard him or been in contact with 
him, but he has an amazing way of knowing what

22:42.751 --> 22:50.166
you're going through. He has, for some reason, his 
thumb is on the pulse of a college student. I can't

22:55.829 --> 22:56.451
explain it. Some people have the gift and he's got 
it. And this was on what nights? Tuesday nights.

23:01.080 --> 23:01.882
Tuesday nights. All right, then on Sundays... 
Sundays I'd go to church. Where? It depended.

23:06.391 --> 23:09.417
Sometimes I'd go to Central Baptist simply 
because I went to Second Baptist. But then I'd go to

23:09.959 --> 23:12.103
Grace Bible Church as well because I... I really, 
really enjoyed Dwight Edwards, who was the pastor

23:12.623 --> 23:15.510
there. Really enjoyed his sermons because it took 
me like three hours to get through. Like I'd have to

23:19.459 --> 23:22.687
go home and just ponder for a while. So I do that.

23:30.562 --> 23:37.230
Like one of the questions that I have here in 
Muskaka, were there any international events or

23:30.562 --> 23:37.230
anything like that off campus that stunned you? 
No, I can't think of any, but see if it's just

23:37.290 --> 23:48.343
December 7 or, were there any international, any 
national catastrophes or, that you remember?

23:48.403 --> 23:50.686
Columbine was my junior year, I think. Do you 
remember where you were when you heard the news?

23:52.969 --> 23:53.730
About Columbine?

23:56.733 --> 23:57.514
No. I don't. I remember I was when Di died, Princess 
Di died. It was two days before school started, I

24:01.962 --> 24:05.665
think, or it was the week before school started, my 
freshman year. And I was at a fish camp party with my

24:06.246 --> 24:08.068
DG leader. And we walked in, and the news was on, and 
it said, do you hear Princess Di died? And we're

24:12.132 --> 24:14.094
like, whatever, it's just a joke. But I totally 
remember that apartment. It was in Scandi

24:15.575 --> 24:17.697
Apartments over on Anderson. Alright, so that 
second, do you go out for Yale later? As a

24:22.662 --> 24:25.064
sophomore, spring semester as a sophomore. 
Describe that. From beginning to end. Oh, man.

24:31.286 --> 24:31.987
Describe that. Well, you decided to do it when? I 
decided to do it Christmas break of my sophomore

24:35.170 --> 24:41.976
year just because it got to the point where I was 
like, okay, if I'm going to do this, then I need to do

24:35.170 --> 24:41.976
it. And I'm the type that I don't like having 
questions about what ifs. I don't like what ifs. If

24:47.041 --> 24:49.424
you have a what if, then in my opinion, then you're 
not doing it right. And so... I'm very much a goer

24:51.950 --> 24:53.392
and a doer. And so I was just like, okay, either I'm 
going to do this or I'm going to regret it for the

24:54.094 --> 24:57.940
rest of my life. So I told my friends, I was like, 
okay, I'm going to run for yell leader. And some of

25:01.065 --> 25:03.930
them were really supportive and others were just 
like, okay, that's really neat. And then all the

25:04.992 --> 25:11.503
spring semester was just trying to grab a hold of 
this thing that is definitely not definable. Um,

25:13.313 --> 25:15.936
There's no handbook on how to run an election. 
There's no handbook on this is how you get elected.

25:18.518 --> 25:22.142
There's no guidelines to say this is how many 
people you need in each area. This is how you do off

25:22.182 --> 25:23.803
campus. This is how you do on campus. This is how you 
budget your money. There's no handbook on that.

25:27.267 --> 25:30.110
It's just doing it and making sure you have the 
right people. How did you do it? I have no idea. I

25:34.054 --> 25:34.734
look back on it. There was a group of us, honestly.

25:39.132 --> 25:43.597
What we did was just very radically different than 
anything anyone had done in the past. We didn't

25:43.617 --> 25:50.424
focus so much on the fact that I was running for Yale 
leader, but on the fact that we wanted to have a

25:43.617 --> 25:50.424
relationship with every person on this campus as 
far as impacting people. It was amazing, like it

25:51.224 --> 25:55.529
really was. First campaign meeting, four people 
were there. Two days before campaign started that

25:58.992 --> 26:03.537
spring break, campaign started, we had 14 people 
sitting in your room. By the last day of

26:03.652 --> 26:06.842
campaigning, we had 160 people sitting in a room. 
And where were these meetings? At my house. At your

26:09.089 --> 26:09.470
house? They were at my house. And what did you call 
it? Did it have a... It didn't have a... It didn't

26:18.805 --> 26:20.768
have a name, but there was definitely something. 
The color that we used was neon green. And so we

26:24.473 --> 26:29.580
totally grabbed onto the neon green thing, both in 
what it meant to us. It meant to us, I guess, joy is

26:29.961 --> 26:38.813
something you could call what my sophomore year 
was, simply because that's what we were trying to

26:29.961 --> 26:38.813
do, is we were trying to make people not just have a 
regular day of class. We were trying to make people

26:38.853 --> 26:40.095
smile. We handed out jokes instead of campaign 
materials. We handed out little smiles, little

26:43.800 --> 26:47.125
green smiles made out of... pipe cleaner. And it 
had your name on it? No. They didn't even have my

26:51.674 --> 26:53.457
name on it. The smiles didn't. The jokes did. But it 
was on the back. We just really tried to make people

26:58.124 --> 27:00.688
happy. We just really tried to make people smile. 
We tried to make it didn't seem like it was

27:02.370 --> 27:05.575
campaigning because it wasn't campaigning. You 
know, it was us having fun. It was us going to meet

27:07.978 --> 27:09.120
people. And I guess it was just contagious. Now 
these were all civilian students in your campaign

27:12.004 --> 27:16.611
ever? Did anybody Did any corps group ever say 
anything? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. What was there? They

27:23.905 --> 27:24.486
didn't like it. They didn't like it. They thought 
it was wrong. They thought what I was standing for

27:26.289 --> 27:32.079
was wrong just because the corps is very not open to 
change. The corps is very not open to anything

27:32.099 --> 27:34.603
that's different than the way they think. How did 
y'all avoid being seen as reactionary to the

27:34.784 --> 27:40.433
corps? It was never an issue with us, just because 
that wasn't my purpose for running. My purpose for

27:43.297 --> 27:44.820
running was not to get the core. My purpose for 
running was not pro non-reg. My purpose for

27:47.423 --> 27:54.935
running is that I loved A&M, and I wanted to 
represent A&M at athletic events and also to

27:47.423 --> 27:54.935
everything else that Yellators do. Did you make 
any speeches anywhere? Mm-hmm. Where?

27:57.679 --> 27:59.261
Everywhere I could. Everywhere I could. I went to 
sororities, fraternities, SGA committees, MSC

28:01.068 --> 28:05.922
committees. There was an open forum in the MSC 
where we spoke. Anywhere I could speak, I'd speak.

28:10.715 --> 28:14.807
And what was the substance of what you tried to 
convey every time? I'd get up and talk about just

28:14.872 --> 28:19.738
the largeness of what I was running for. Kind of 
give people a sense of what Yell Leader was in my

28:20.339 --> 28:23.283
mind. And then I had a friend, actually, that would 
sing a song. He had his guitar, and he would come in

28:25.926 --> 28:30.392
and sing a song that was more just fun than 
anything. It was very much a campaign tactic

28:31.153 --> 28:34.958
because it was a very catchy song. You couldn't 
hear the song and not have it stuck in your head for

28:35.459 --> 28:37.501
an hour. And it was a song that we wrote. And so it 
was... I think that that's the reason I won

28:43.002 --> 28:44.604
personally. What worked in hindsight? What did 
you do that worked best and what did you do that

28:46.706 --> 28:50.830
worked least? What worked best is I focused on 
individuals. I didn't worry about

28:54.193 --> 28:55.494
organizations. I didn't worry about the fact that 
the Corps was doing this. I didn't worry about what

28:58.477 --> 29:00.019
other candidates were doing. I worried about what 
the group, my friends, and the campaign staff

29:00.759 --> 29:06.645
wanted to do and we just stuck to that.

29:09.668 --> 29:11.710
To do anything differently,

29:13.613 --> 29:16.160
I don't know, I don't think I'd do anything 
differently. And when the votes were counted, how

29:17.323 --> 29:20.211
did you, where did you? We were at Sol Ross and I 
remember my friends and we were all huddled

29:20.993 --> 29:25.866
together and we made the runoff, which was just 
enormous. Just because there was nine people

29:26.588 --> 29:29.395
running that year. and we made a runoff with one of 
the, it was one of the guys in the Corps. There's

29:33.642 --> 29:33.983
two? One guy won it outright, and then I was in a 
runoff with the other Corps guy from Corps block.

29:39.853 --> 29:40.614
For the one more slot? For the one more slot. Who led 
in the primary? His name was Bubba Mosier. No, who

29:44.581 --> 29:45.944
led? He did. He did. I was behind. I was about a 
thousand votes behind. Okay. which I was worried

29:50.857 --> 30:01.207
about, but I wasn't too worried about simply 
because there were a lot of other people that I was

29:50.857 --> 30:01.207
hopefully going to get their vote now that it was 
just in between a core guy and a civilian. Even

30:02.328 --> 30:06.772
though that still wasn't an issue with me, just 
campaign thinking was this. Runoffs just did much

30:08.994 --> 30:10.596
of the same thing. We didn't really change 
anything around. I remember changing signs to say

30:12.477 --> 30:17.522
runoff on it just to let people know that it was 
runoff. And then when the votes were counted for

30:18.245 --> 30:21.082
the runoff. I remember we were out at Sully. I 
remember my friend and I actually, the guy who ran

30:23.020 --> 30:28.827
my campaign, who has impacted my college career a 
lot, his name is Sko Maps, Roscoe Maps. His name is

30:29.708 --> 30:31.530
Roscoe Maps. M-A-P-P-S. P-P-S, okay. Roscoe, and 
people call him Sko. That's his name is Sko, S-C-O.

30:38.077 --> 30:41.180
His name is Sko, and Sko is the campaign manager. 
And Sko, are we about out? We're about three, four

30:44.364 --> 30:46.166
minutes. Okay. Sko, we were sitting in Allface 
Chapel, and The Lord was a big part of that. We

30:52.902 --> 30:53.863
didn't want to do anything. It was so neat just 
because it seemed like every day the Lord gave us

30:54.584 --> 30:57.887
just enough to get through that day. And then we'd 
sleep our two hours and then we'd get exactly what

30:57.927 --> 31:01.130
we needed the next day. We were sitting in All Face 
Chapel and it was done. And we had about 45 minutes

31:03.813 --> 31:09.859
until we would go meet our friends to go eat dinner 
and then walk over together. And he and I were just

31:09.879 --> 31:10.900
sitting there. And I think we just knew that we won. 
We just knew. I remember looking at each other. And

31:16.125 --> 31:18.627
we talked about it afterwards that we just knew. 
And when the votes were counted, what was the

31:18.607 --> 31:21.750
margin? Mayhem. I won by 271 votes. Was there a 
large turnout, small turnout? Voter turnout. By

31:29.138 --> 31:30.220
Aggie standards? Large turnout. It was the 
largest runoff turnout that we'd ever had. And by

31:33.884 --> 31:38.509
and large, was it a core civilian vote, as far as you 
know? Yeah, it really was. It really was. Did

31:41.292 --> 31:42.673
anybody accuse you?
