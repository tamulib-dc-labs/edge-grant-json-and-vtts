WEBVTT

00:04.300 --> 00:18.529
But what I'm trying to do is put together a little 
history of the executive secretary's position

00:04.300 --> 00:18.529
with the Texas Medical Association. I'll have to 
ramble a little bit. In fact, I'll have to go back

00:21.278 --> 00:28.228
and refer to some of my notes on dates. But for 
specific dates, times, and places, we'll have to

00:28.248 --> 00:41.486
refer to the Texas Federal Bulletin, which is on 
file in the Austin office.

00:41.506 --> 00:44.550
We will start with the year 1943. Many, many things 
happened during that particular year. And if you

00:48.505 --> 00:53.532
may recall, it was the tail end of the war period. 
Dr. T.O. Booth was state veterinarian in the early

00:56.376 --> 01:11.297
part of 42,

00:56.376 --> 01:11.297
and volunteered to go back into the service. Dr. 
M.B. Stearns of Dallas was the original editor of

01:13.546 --> 01:34.109
the Texas Veterinary Bulletin and had issued some 
two or three

01:13.546 --> 01:34.109
issues prior to his return to military service. 
And I think if we check the bulletin records, we'll

01:34.890 --> 01:41.858
find that Dr. Booth probably published at least 
one or two. But I became a state veterinarian upon

01:43.171 --> 01:52.741
the volunteering of Dr. T.O. Booth. I was 
assistant state veterinarian at the time,

01:55.183 --> 02:01.069
stationed in New Brunswick, Texas. When a group of 
my colleagues got together in Austin and decided

02:03.011 --> 02:10.579
that I should move on up as state veterinarian, It 
was a rather embarrassing situation because,

02:11.842 --> 02:27.997
first off, they had agreed to assess 
veterinarians in Texas to supplement the

02:11.842 --> 02:27.997
paycheck for state veterinarians. Believe it or 
not, in 1943, the state veterinarian's salary was

02:28.537 --> 02:40.448
$2,750 a year, plus expenses.

02:41.221 --> 02:52.154
decided to go to Fort Worth, become the state 
veterinarian, but the course could not accept any

02:41.221 --> 02:52.154
contributions from my colleagues. As it turned 
out, I inherited the Texas Veterinarian

02:52.175 --> 03:04.930
Billetton and also the secretaryship of the State 
Veterinary Medical Association, or the Texas

02:52.175 --> 03:04.930
Veterinary Medical Association.

03:07.533 --> 03:08.815
We were able to maneuver and manage I officed in the 
W.T. Wagner building downtown Fort Worth and

03:15.324 --> 03:39.814
there was a small office on the same floor 
available and I rented that office and placed the

03:15.324 --> 03:39.814
secretary and the bulletin office in that room the 
idea being that I did not want to be in a position of

03:41.684 --> 03:52.945
conflict of interest, and by separating the 
offices, we at least could show our desire to

03:41.684 --> 03:52.945
remain a separate entity. Again, during that 
year, I also inherited a position on the World

03:55.350 --> 04:02.764
Manpower Commission which had to do with the 
drafting of veterinarians or also drafting of all

04:03.976 --> 04:18.436
professional people such as physicians, nurses, 
dentists, and the like. Mine was representing the

04:18.456 --> 04:21.801
veterinary profession. So 1943 was a bang-up 
start

04:21.821 --> 04:31.114
for the first time probably in the history. was a 
separate and complete office for the Executive

04:31.988 --> 04:39.623
Secretary of the Texas Veteran Association. I 
mentioned the War Mountain Fire Commission, the

04:39.643 --> 04:47.238
Bulletin, and so forth, all supplemented towards 
this office. And the expenses alone were all that

04:48.520 --> 04:54.452
were taken by me as secretary at the time and this 
was a brand new step because the first time any

04:54.820 --> 05:24.456
funds had been provided to a secretary per se the 
title of executive secretary just kind of grew out

04:54.820 --> 05:24.456
of the position we managed to get some furniture 
from the wall mine power commission which was a

04:54.820 --> 05:24.456
government agency desk chairs the like cabinet 
filing cabinets I began to step out, and then, of

05:25.499 --> 05:36.898
course, the first major step was to gather funds to 
continue the publication of the Texas

05:25.499 --> 05:36.898
Veterinarian Bill. This put us into the 
advertising game, and, of course, we catered to

05:38.160 --> 05:48.537
advertisers with sales only to veterinarians. We 
were rather selfish and aristocratic in our

05:49.715 --> 06:03.615
procedures because we set a fee for the 
advertising that was necessary to cover the cost

05:49.715 --> 06:03.615
of the publication. And many of the companies we 
dealt with had advertising agencies who had

06:04.937 --> 06:12.548
always expected a commission. We had a flat rate 
and told them so. Of course, they felt like they

06:18.908 --> 06:28.237
were obligated, in a sense, to advertise with us, 
so we got along beautifully in that route. The

06:29.739 --> 06:48.578
reason I rival so much here is that for the ten years 
that I served as the Executive Secretary, 95

06:29.739 --> 06:48.578
percent of its success could be based upon the fact 
that it was a veterinarian representing

06:29.739 --> 06:48.578
veterinarians. and the various positions that I 
held during that interim complemented or

06:50.009 --> 06:58.398
assisted in our development. In so many words, we 
could not have grown as rapidly as I think we did had

06:59.439 --> 07:19.982
it not been for the fact that as state veterinarian 
I was able to work it right along hand in hand in my

06:59.439 --> 07:19.982
visitations out over the state and the like, 
created the atmosphere of consultation, etc. The

07:23.237 --> 07:37.075
year 1943 was a definite growing up period of the 
Texas Veterinary Medical Association. I mention

07:37.095 --> 07:49.632
this because it was also a growing up period of the 
acceptance of the veterinary profession, the

07:37.095 --> 07:49.632
pressures that were placed upon them during the 
war period, The fact that unless they were

07:51.367 --> 08:00.696
essentially classified within their area or 
territory, they were vulnerable to the draft. All

08:02.077 --> 08:08.683
in all, it was a tremendous transition.

08:08.703 --> 08:19.213
I'll have to, of course, compare the various 
positions that I held during that time as having

08:08.703 --> 08:19.213
direct influence and vice versa on each other. The 
state veterinarian's office was largely managed

08:20.594 --> 08:29.447
and handled by a layperson who was called a 
director. And there was a constant maneuver that

08:29.467 --> 08:49.217
took place between he and I during that period, 
resulting finally in the reestablishment of the

08:29.467 --> 08:49.217
state veterinarian as the director and the 
administrative office of the Livestock Sanitary

08:29.467 --> 08:49.217
Commission of Texas. It was an uphill battle 
because, again, we were feeling our way by

08:50.362 --> 09:06.120
interrelationship between the veterinary 
profession and the enforcement agencies, as was

08:50.362 --> 09:06.120
the state veterinary. The enforcement, of 
course, necessitated a closer relationship

09:06.140 --> 09:19.795
because, in many instances, there was a pot called 
the kettle black, and the veterinarian in the

09:06.140 --> 09:19.795
field was actually responsible for carrying out 
the majority of the enforcement regulations of

09:20.652 --> 09:27.581
that department. Thus, a constant source of 
information could be sent out by way of the Texas

09:27.601 --> 09:43.924
Veteran Air Bulletin with the interlocking of the 
duties of the two offices. I know this is rambling

09:43.984 --> 09:48.550
and it's hard to explain,

09:49.458 --> 10:06.519
We did begin to understand the requirements 
necessary for veterinarians to make interstate

09:49.458 --> 10:06.519
shipments and handle livestock disease 
outbreaks and on and on and on. We felt kind of

10:06.539 --> 10:19.414
lonesome during that period insofar as 
communications between veterinarians back to

10:06.539 --> 10:19.414
their alma mater at A&M uh all of these uh it looked 
like the veterinarian was the last one to receive

10:20.204 --> 10:41.976
any information and the rest of it went out to the 
agricultural channels to the county agents and so

10:20.204 --> 10:41.976
this led on then eventually to the movement of the 
office finally to a m at which time in 1945 I

10:42.682 --> 11:03.742
accepted the position of Extension Veteran, 
again taking the office of the State Association

10:42.682 --> 11:03.742
with me, with the full sanction of my bosses and the 
like, and we established another office, what was

10:42.682 --> 11:03.742
called the North Gate of Texas A&M. It was an 
upstairs office, again keeping our

11:04.042 --> 11:10.748
relationships separated as much as possible. 
When we got into the extension veterinary side of

11:11.943 --> 11:24.011
it, it was with the full understanding of the 
bosses that we were going into an educational

11:11.943 --> 11:24.011
period. The prime purpose of my employment was to 
cement relationships between the various

11:28.885 --> 11:35.801
agricultural representatives, such as county 
agents, and the local veterinarian. Kind of a

11:35.821 --> 11:44.903
goodwill emissary, and at the same time offered 
the golden opportunity to visit with all of the

11:35.821 --> 11:44.903
veterinarians in Texas. In fact, Dr. Marsteller, 
my previous dean of the veterinary school, was

11:46.520 --> 11:57.155
very envious of the fact that I couldn't go out all 
over Texas. Also, it was true of the faculty of the

11:57.937 --> 12:01.101
veterinary college. I was free to travel the state 
of Texas, preach the gospel, but I tried

12:01.962 --> 12:14.080
desperately to come back and at least report to the 
dean of the veterinary school of what was

12:01.962 --> 12:14.080
happening out there. The Texas Gun Air Bill 
continued. Each time, as in Fort Worth and also at

12:19.085 --> 12:35.862
A&M, it was printed and handled by local printing 
companies and was absolutely free of any other

12:19.085 --> 12:35.862
connection. The

12:35.882 --> 12:41.248
period of 43 to 45 I mentioned was a growing up 
period. We took veterinarians from cowboy boots

12:46.125 --> 12:50.650
to tuxedos. We had many meetings, you know, as it 
was established, one in the summer at A&M and one in

12:52.151 --> 13:04.042
the fall elsewhere through the state. These were 
largely fraternal-type meetings. We did have

13:07.946 --> 13:09.447
good programs. But the camaraderie and so forth 
began to build a profession to recognize each

13:10.338 --> 13:24.100
other's talents and abilities and began to work 
together. The most outstanding meeting, I guess,

13:25.803 --> 13:30.270
during that particular period I don't remember 
the exact date without checking, but it was a

13:31.212 --> 13:57.304
combination meeting of the Southern Veterinary 
Medical Association held in Dallas, Texas, when

13:31.212 --> 13:57.304
Dr. R.A. Self of Dallas was the local chairman, and 
we had a rather large gathering of veterinarians

13:31.212 --> 13:57.304
from Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, et 
cetera. So much for that, Rodman, and the period

13:58.212 --> 14:06.423
of A&M episode. She made the relationships a great 
deal between the veterinary school and the

14:07.324 --> 14:17.458
veterinary profession because we were on the same 
ground and territories. And it had grown and

14:18.720 --> 14:24.928
developed so much that By that time, they were 
paying a fixed salary and offering secretarial

14:26.275 --> 14:35.470
assistance to the executive secretary.

14:37.913 --> 14:41.659
This is where the program began to grow. In 1948, I 
accepted a position of pharmaceutical

14:41.679 --> 14:52.857
representative for one of the solid veterinary 
supply houses United States and it was done I know

14:53.326 --> 15:12.027
because of my contact throughout the state and 
they bought that rather than any particular

14:53.326 --> 15:12.027
ability again I was free to wander the state of 
Texas under the guise of service representing the

15:12.260 --> 15:35.567
veterinary supply house but always been able to 
carry on the duties and responsibilities of the

15:12.260 --> 15:35.567
executive secretary and build the bulletin into a 
much better publication and also carry the gospel

15:12.260 --> 15:35.567
to the veterinarians of texas about that time of 
course in between there we lost the dean of the

15:36.307 --> 16:05.925
veterinary school started searching for new ones 
wound up with dr rc dunn as acting dean and we began

15:36.307 --> 16:05.925
to try hard to put together the extension 
veterinary directly into the veterinary school

15:36.307 --> 16:05.925
this was a hopefully an act that would be accepted 
at that time but it wasn't and of course that again,

16:06.125 --> 16:11.593
disturbed me enough to move on to the next step. 
From the latter part of 1949,

16:13.615 --> 16:26.614
I got the desire to come back home and get back into 
general practice. Having done all of these other

16:26.634 --> 16:35.406
things over a period of many years, I was beginning 
to feel like it was time to settle down. So I came

16:35.943 --> 16:48.201
back to New Braunfels at the request of a 
cooperative group and organized a co-op cremary.

16:48.221 --> 16:53.489
I built it from scratch and managed it through to 
1951. And during the time of the co-op cremary, I

16:54.110 --> 16:59.959
established my own veterinary hospital. Dan was 
able to put my office or the executive secretary's

17:00.952 --> 17:08.986
office all into one unit. I had a full-time 
secretary to assist and an awful good local

17:09.006 --> 17:25.255
printing publisher that assisted us in 
maintaining and keeping the bulletin going. And

17:26.787 --> 17:41.263
the only difficulty arose, of course, was still 
some callbacks on other relationships we'd had

17:26.787 --> 17:41.263
over a period of time. In other words, it wound up or 
accumulated or cumulated or whatever the word I

17:41.283 --> 17:48.992
want to use. In 1953, thereabouts,

17:49.012 --> 17:56.220
they had a landfrax outbreak in Wichita Falls. At 
the request of a colleague in Wichita, I was called

17:57.500 --> 18:11.013
up to assist in negotiating some kind of a 
diplomatic maneuver. The Red Hands were all

18:11.033 --> 18:21.683
feeling a sudden burst of popularity, and each one 
feeling like he was a hotshot for the area. The

18:23.024 --> 18:25.667
livestock side of the commission was balking. The 
local cattle raisers were squawking, and so I

18:26.997 --> 18:50.727
reluctantly went up, visited with the 
practitioners for breakfast, settled on one

18:26.997 --> 18:50.727
representative, made our pitch to the cattlemen, 
and then was turned down by the livestock signer

18:26.997 --> 18:50.727
commission, and I began to realize that In my 
position, I was no longer speaking for the

18:51.061 --> 18:55.808
profession. It was kind of a lonesome affair and 
felt like it was time to move on. So in 1953, I

19:01.017 --> 19:16.381
resigned as executive secretary and was awarded a 
lifetime membership in the Texas Dynamical

19:01.017 --> 19:16.381
Association.

19:16.401 --> 19:17.963
So far, this sounds like purely a personal 
history. And therefore, this segment, we will

19:21.374 --> 19:38.458
attempt to cover some of the accomplishments that 
we feel like took place during those 10 years in the

19:21.374 --> 19:38.458
veterinary profession itself. First off, we'll 
go back and repeat that the association to the

19:38.478 --> 19:46.228
various offices held and the fact that I was a 
veterinarian I think helped tremendously in that

19:47.018 --> 19:55.930
period of ten years. We were talking to each other, 
we were understanding each other, and the

19:57.192 --> 20:07.386
association began to grow. The early years were 
largely expenses were taken care of by a

20:13.597 --> 20:36.972
registration fee at the conventions these were 
nominal and largely paid just for the convention

20:13.597 --> 20:36.972
there was no surplus funds developed at that time 
as we began to grow of course developed the

20:13.597 --> 20:36.972
commercial aspect of displays and began to make a 
little bit of money off the convention to assist in

20:38.487 --> 20:44.495
the growth of the office. Some of the major 
highlights, I think, probably took place in the

20:45.876 --> 20:59.533
changeover in the state veterinarian's office, 
put the veterinarian back into his position of

20:45.876 --> 20:59.533
responsibility. This was all done by full 
knowledge of the profession itself, of what was

21:06.922 --> 21:09.325
taking place and what was going on. Also, we began 
to diligently

21:10.867 --> 21:28.472
participate in disease outbreaks of all types 
with tremendous cooperation from A&M Experiment

21:10.867 --> 21:28.472
Station. We began to get first-hand information 
on what was going on and were able to transmit it

21:28.492 --> 21:36.523
back to the veterinary profession rally the 
troops, as the words are, and begin to

21:37.432 --> 21:47.284
intelligently approach such things as rabies 
outbreaks and the like. Many, many experiences

21:47.304 --> 21:57.717
directly with local veterinary associations 
were necessary during that particular time.

21:57.757 --> 22:05.447
This, of course, expanded greatly during the 
extension period at A&M because of the

21:57.757 --> 22:05.447
relationship ability to take a faculty member or a 
experiment station member directly with you in

22:06.203 --> 22:16.216
contact with the general public and the 
veterinary detectives. I also recall that the

22:17.497 --> 22:25.388
sessions of the Veterinary Association were held 
in the summer and the fall. In the fall elsewhere

22:26.189 --> 22:31.295
over the state, in the summer always at A&M. We've 
managed to encourage A&M to understand that we

22:35.330 --> 22:44.548
were a profession such as anything that came out of 
the college, from engineer or whatnot. And we felt

22:45.410 --> 22:52.163
like they owed an obligation to the profession 
just like they did to those others. And they were

22:52.844 --> 22:54.267
holding various type summer seminars for other 
groups, and so during that period they did agree

22:54.888 --> 23:09.070
and took over the summer session as a 
college-sponsored event. The conventions that

23:09.090 --> 23:17.043
were held, like I mentioned before, were largely 
fraternal type. Everybody had a good time, lots of

23:17.203 --> 23:23.072
entertaining and visitations and bill sessions. 
But began to develop a strong program covering the

23:24.115 --> 23:34.530
general practice of MMS. The specialization 
began to appear and the use of radiological

23:35.852 --> 23:44.745
equipment and on and on and on. All of those 
developments were In other

23:47.842 --> 24:17.106
words, the veterinary executive secretary was 
closely related to that development program and

23:47.842 --> 24:17.106
consequently kept it within the realm of what they 
felt was actually the needs of the profession at

23:47.842 --> 24:17.106
the time.

24:18.031 --> 24:31.165
I guess the big highlight was the fact that we 
changed from enforcement aspects or studies to

24:18.031 --> 24:31.165
educational. And in the educational realm, we 
just had a case recently to recall that 40-some odd

24:32.646 --> 24:43.718
years ago we organized the first group of 
interested cattlemen in brucellosis. We had

24:51.208 --> 25:01.319
representatives of sheep, goat, and raisers, the 
swine breeders, the herford breeders, the

24:51.208 --> 25:01.319
shorthorn breeders, the Texas Cattle Raisers 
Association, and on and on. And we were able to put

25:02.240 --> 25:10.009
together a session at NM,

25:02.240 --> 25:10.009
which We thought we had full agreement of all of the 
representatives of the various breed

25:10.242 --> 25:33.212
organizations, but were flat overruled on 
parliamentary procedure by the Texas Cattle

25:10.242 --> 25:33.212
Raiders Association, in which they said that 
those people all had to go back to their

25:10.242 --> 25:33.212
organizations, get their approval before they 
could vote. on any program for the state of Texas.

25:37.630 --> 25:40.615
Ironically, here it is 40-some-odd years later. 
They had a big wrestle in the legislature this last

25:41.817 --> 25:45.422
session. Someday, someday.

25:51.111 --> 25:57.681
The rest of it, I'll have to refer to the Texas 
Department of Buildings because it attempted

25:58.302 --> 26:06.094
during that period to pretty much carry the 
minutes of the various meetings held by the

25:58.302 --> 26:06.094
organization. The board of directors, the 
executive board, all functioned in proper

26:06.114 --> 26:17.391
procedures and orders, and nearly all of the work 
was carried out. specifically based upon the

26:18.248 --> 26:25.519
desires of the representatives of the veteran 
profession. There were no new innovative

26:25.539 --> 26:39.700
programs that I can think of at the moment that were 
revolutionary, but just a steady, progressive

26:25.539 --> 26:39.700
development of the profession itself.

26:46.413 --> 26:55.245
This is another form of reminiscing over a period 
of, well, I guess you'd call it veterinary

26:46.413 --> 26:55.245
medicine in general. Dr. Bob Norton's here now and 
raised a few questions about Dr. Mark Francis and

26:56.787 --> 27:10.024
Dr. Hubert Schmidt and Dr. Marsteller and some of 
those in the heydays. Actually, Dr. Francis was

27:11.101 --> 27:19.918
the first major participant in the organization 
of the Texas Veterinarians. He was also licensed

27:19.938 --> 27:24.346
number one in the state of Texas. Dr. Marsteller 
was his protege, and so was Dr. Hubert Schmidt.

27:29.736 --> 27:32.822
Hubert came to A&M from Comfort, Texas. As an 
agriculture student and befriended Dr. Francis,

27:33.595 --> 27:43.125
Francis encouraged him to go back to Berlin, 
Germany, and he did. He got his degree there and

27:43.866 --> 27:48.972
came back and worked the rest of his life bringing 
him in. Dr. Marsteller was a friend from Ohio that

27:48.992 --> 27:59.563
Dr. Francis brought down early in the 
organization or early beginning of Edmure

27:48.992 --> 27:59.563
School. Dr. Francis came originally in the 
agricultural aspects of it did a little work in the

28:03.430 --> 28:32.543
early experiment days and also is responsible for 
dr rc dunn who came in and actually built a

28:03.430 --> 28:32.543
laboratory and produced the whole collar vaccine 
on the campus i think now it's a veterinary museum

28:03.430 --> 28:32.543
or it was for a while i don't know what the building 
is now i think they moved some of that to the new

28:03.430 --> 28:32.543
library the uh Dr. Francis was an old philosopher, 
really, as a teacher. He used to act out a number of

28:37.893 --> 28:40.497
things. I never will forget when he was giving us a 
description of the upper esophagus and its

28:40.577 --> 28:52.275
relationship with the trachea and so forth. He 
described it as an old bill downtown on a Saturday

28:52.456 --> 28:58.986
afternoon buying a red soda water And when he drank 
it, you'd see that old atom dropper jump up and

28:59.827 --> 29:10.444
down, and then he'd give a description of how it's 
all interconnected and those type

28:59.827 --> 29:10.444
illustrations. He was not truly a teacher in the 
sense that he didn't conform with college rules or

29:10.464 --> 29:18.137
regulations. All of our examinations were pick 
out five students in the room and have them write

29:18.157 --> 29:24.788
five questions on the boards. We'd answer all the 
questions. We were not permitted to leave the room

29:27.532 --> 29:30.901
until the last man finished. And he'd take all the 
papers and throw them in a trash can and said, the

29:31.803 --> 29:41.106
college said I had to give you a test, but they 
didn't say a word about who was to grade the papers.

29:41.947 --> 29:52.541
He did all of his grading based on attendance in his 
classroom and his observation of your procedures

29:41.947 --> 29:52.541
and your attitudes and the like. I had him, 
fortunately, for both years of anatomy and, of

29:54.103 --> 30:04.056
course, in the latter two We were only associated 
with them on a friendship basis through Dr. Dunn's

30:04.373 --> 30:17.288
sister-in-law, Evelyn Cahill, who was Dr. 
Francis and Dr. Marsteller's secretary. So was

30:18.670 --> 30:25.158
Mary Dunn, who was Dr. Dunn's wife, who was also a 
secretary in the veterinary school. Dr. Francis'

30:27.601 --> 30:32.727
main family family, I guess, came, of course, with 
his sister. dipping of cattle for the Texas Fever

30:33.550 --> 30:36.854
State. But his other was association with an old 
gentleman over in the biology department. I can't

30:43.002 --> 30:46.587
think of his name right now, but biology and 
botany. And they used to go together every

30:47.628 --> 30:58.242
Saturday down in the Brazos River bottoms on 
archaeological

30:47.628 --> 30:58.242
projects.
