WEBVTT

00:01.988 --> 00:06.815
In your later years, you had the pool at the YMCA, 
and you had Sunday school classes there. Yeah. And

00:07.556 --> 00:11.882
any club meetings of the kind were held there. You 
see, it was not too large a place. And it was in that

00:15.227 --> 00:21.195
year that they did something with the basement. 
Somebody got a lease and put a barber shop in there,

00:22.036 --> 00:30.308
and a man named Casey started a soft drink counter 
in there. I didn't know students had as much money

00:31.233 --> 00:34.636
as they had. I didn't have any money to throw 
around, but Casey was supposed to have a gold mine.

00:42.585 --> 00:46.949
Did the Y there on campus operate as otherwise did? 
Were there rooms for people who visited campus?

00:49.352 --> 00:51.153
No, there was no rooms for visiting. There was two 
rooms back of the foyer

00:51.654 --> 00:59.502
in the of the main room of the YMCA was cut off from 
the rest of it, and the entrance was on the back

01:00.697 --> 01:07.625
side. There was stairs on the back side. And those 
two rooms up there were occupied by officers

01:10.068 --> 01:15.094
during the war activities. There was no other 
rooms or facilities for guests in the YMCA. What

01:25.046 --> 01:27.008
was the life like in the dormitories?

01:30.143 --> 01:32.566
Was it pretty well regimented by the military? 
Yes, it was military regulation. Of course, there

01:35.489 --> 01:42.876
was a lot of extracurricular activities took 
place, water fights and things of that kind. But it

01:43.878 --> 01:50.104
was one racket we had. I remember they had a rule you 
had to have one light in your room, and you had to be

01:50.164 --> 01:57.552
out after taps. Well, these electrical engineers 
wired those rooms so that, well, first they had

01:59.489 --> 02:18.974
shades that wouldn't let in light out the windows, 
because the guards, the sergeants, the army

01:59.489 --> 02:18.974
sergeants were the regular. What's his name? So 
I've just almost slipped. The two sergeants I'd

02:23.159 --> 02:25.362
love today. It was just the opposite of each other. 
There were older people in the retired army,

02:28.030 --> 02:36.438
sergeants, and they patrolled the campus. They 
weren't instructors in military science? No, no.

02:38.580 --> 02:40.622
They were under the commandant. They was in charge 
of regulating the regulations carried out. One of

02:45.806 --> 02:49.470
them, of course, was lights out at 1030. But these 
upperclassmen, especially, put these heavy

02:54.923 --> 02:56.645
shades on these windows. There were great big 
windows in that poster hall, you know, eight-foot

02:56.665 --> 03:01.111
windows. And then they would wire these rooms so 
they'd have lights all over the darn place. But it

03:07.219 --> 03:11.024
was fixed so that when the door opened, every light 
went out except that one. That was always a sneaky

03:12.606 --> 03:14.949
thing. The wiring was covered by pendants and 
things of that kind. And only the Sophisticated

03:23.543 --> 03:28.751
electricians could do that, but otherwise you 
just had the one light. I had a buggy lap robe for a

03:29.812 --> 03:39.947
table cover on a board table, and a stove. I should 
have liked to get a hold of that old stove. Only the

03:42.311 --> 03:46.457
older dorms, I think, had stoves. Did you have a 
wood box in each room? Yep, a wood box and a

03:48.060 --> 03:52.386
washstand with a bucket of water. I've had his 
disadvantages. My first roommate was a Fort Worth

03:58.110 --> 04:05.957
boy, but he had syphilis and I didn't know syphilis 
from anything else. I didn't know it until later.

04:07.018 --> 04:17.528
He had syphilis and his hair was falling out just 
like snowflakes and sores all over him. And he

04:17.548 --> 04:19.150
complained that I

04:23.500 --> 04:25.322
I said something to him. Anyhow, he complained to 
the commandant that I had done something. I forgot

04:32.092 --> 04:34.655
whether they insulted him or something. I didn't 
know what he had. I knew he had that stuff. The

04:39.942 --> 04:45.449
sergeant called me up on the carpet, wanted to know 
why I wasn't getting along with this fellow, and I

04:39.942 --> 04:45.449
told him. This fellow had some kind of disease, and 
he wasn't very clean. And the next thing I knew,

04:52.745 --> 04:55.471
they had him out of school. The hospital found out 
he had syphilis.

05:00.822 --> 05:12.306
In the dormitories where you only had a washstand 
and a

05:00.822 --> 05:12.306
stove like that in each room, where did you bathe? 
There was one room down on the first floor with

05:12.978 --> 05:18.566
showers in it. And of course, the toilet was down 
there, too. They had one room for the toilet and

05:21.050 --> 05:23.914
another room for the showers. That was the 
entrance of the building down on the first floor.

05:27.640 --> 05:29.162
So you had to run down there for showers. You had to 
run down there for toilet. And the other

05:32.106 --> 05:35.952
dormitories had toilet on the same floor. Now, you 
mentioned you were in the Foster Hall as a fish.

05:40.138 --> 05:42.782
Were you there for other years, too? freshman and 
sophomore year. My junior year I was there, but

05:46.034 --> 05:52.341
that was October. We hotheads got enlisted. No, 
that junior year I was—I

05:57.426 --> 06:11.200
don't know how I wound up in that other hall with 
Charlie Babcock, his And we were working on

06:11.720 --> 06:17.849
advertising for the year's annual. And that's 
when I enlisted. What is that dormitory that's

06:19.131 --> 06:26.722
just next to Ross Hall, just north of it? Mitchell 
was on this side of the street. What was it? And it

06:30.167 --> 06:33.852
was, oh, I didn't think I'd ever forget that. 
Pfeiffer was over there somewhere. Huh?

06:35.815 --> 06:37.558
Pfeiffer? Pfeiffer was one of the oldest. Yeah. It 
was one of the oldest buildings on the campus over

06:41.335 --> 06:44.880
on the other side there. Well, anyhow, I was there 
for that portion of the year. And then after that,

06:52.151 --> 07:00.303
they reserved Goodwin Hall,

06:52.151 --> 07:00.303
which is in front of Foster Hall. When

07:01.285 --> 07:10.178
they built the new auditorium there, it was over 
here at the end of the street. The first Bissell

07:10.428 --> 07:14.634
Hall, Goodwin was the older hall. It was there when 
I first went. Goodwin Hall was there. It was a

07:18.399 --> 07:22.264
three-story in the basement. And all of the 
service company was quartered in that building.

07:27.472 --> 07:38.427
And I stayed there until the 42nd Service Company 
was moved out and the new one brought in. and I was

07:38.744 --> 07:40.546
retained in that one. And then they took over 
Goodwin and Ross, and then they built some

07:41.528 --> 07:51.001
barracks, and I went later into Austin Hall. They 
took over all those because the student body had

07:51.021 --> 07:55.467
declined considerably. So the Goodwin Hall and 
Mitchell, not Mitchell, Ross, Austin, One other,

08:07.398 --> 08:11.164
the one I can't name, was taken over by the 
military. And that lasted until 1918, November,

08:12.586 --> 08:23.142
when the armistice was signed and things moved 
out. And I came back in January to enter school

08:23.162 --> 08:27.549
again. That was the saddest part of the picture 
because there was a lot of bitterness. in the

08:36.946 --> 08:38.008
atmosphere. Between the military, I think, and 
this college, I think there was some friction,

08:39.530 --> 08:53.590
although I can't put my finger on it, and there was 
considerable friction between the college and

08:39.530 --> 08:53.590
the town. This was right after the war? Right after 
the war. Very much unhappiness. Of course, a lot of

09:01.802 --> 09:06.008
people in Bryan had died, and we'd lost 300 or 400 
there in College Station, at least that many. I

09:10.308 --> 09:11.709
never did have a record on it. But I've seen the 
conference start to seal them for boxes waiting to

09:12.510 --> 09:17.856
be shipped out. Well, just death from the flu there 
on campus.

09:26.744 --> 09:28.226
I suppose they still do that. If there's a death on 
campus, they have a military parade. And that was

09:33.663 --> 09:36.106
always an impressive ceremony. That happened 
four times while I was in college. Now, this was the

09:41.232 --> 09:43.575
death of a student. They'd have a military parade. 
Well, now they have a ceremony which they call

09:49.242 --> 09:51.845
silver taps. Oh, they had silver taps. And then in 
addition to that, they had the parade. Used to

09:56.991 --> 10:00.996
parade down to the railroad station to put the box 
on there. Well, I don't... There's no railroad

10:02.806 --> 10:04.828
there now. Well, the railroad still runs through 
there. It was on a freight train. I've been there

10:09.473 --> 10:10.654
almost three years. I don't know that there's been 
a death on campus. Whenever a student is killed off

10:13.958 --> 10:19.564
campus, they have silver taps at, I believe, 10 
o'clock in the evening.

10:23.147 --> 10:28.493
We have a picture in the archives of a group of 
students marching down the road to Bryan.

10:29.198 --> 10:34.325
supposedly in 1919, and someone has identified it 
as a student strike in 1919.

10:37.169 --> 10:43.257
Somebody else was told me to know that after the 
armistice was signed, a number of students

10:37.169 --> 10:43.257
marched down to Bryan for a celebration. Yes, they 
did. So it was a celebration, celebrating the

10:45.040 --> 10:48.104
armistice. I remember I went to class, and these 
students came around the corner in mobs, eight or

10:48.124 --> 10:57.417
ten deep, And they were shouting terms which I 
don't remember. But nobody went to classes. I

11:04.224 --> 11:11.151
mean, there were no classes held because a few 
dumbbells like me showed up in class, didn't know

11:04.224 --> 11:11.151
what was going on.

11:15.075 --> 11:20.360
But the student body marched, and a segment of them 
marched to Brian's, I remember. But I wasn't with

11:20.961 --> 11:23.664
that group and didn't see them. But that did 
happen, I'm pretty sure.

11:28.531 --> 11:31.174
Do you remember the dormitory you lived in the last 
year you were there? I lived in the dormitory next

11:33.157 --> 11:43.389
to

11:33.157 --> 11:43.389
Speza Hall. That dormitory, if I had brought my 
annual down here, I could have shown you a picture.

11:49.296 --> 11:49.736
Well, let's see. There's, I believe, Leggett and 
Milner. Leggett. Leggett. I believe it was

11:52.960 --> 11:53.821
Leggett. Leggett Hall is next to the dormitory, I 
believe. That's Speza, you mean? Mm-hmm.

11:58.130 --> 12:00.533
Leggett's next to Speezer. Yeah, next to Speezer, 
yeah. Yeah, I was in that dormitory for the last

12:02.516 --> 12:11.547
year I was there, and my roommates are both all 
dead. On the mention of Speezer Hall, what was the

12:13.189 --> 12:16.754
food like in Speezer? Well, I heard a great deal of 
criticism by students, but I never had any

12:17.815 --> 12:27.107
complaints about There was more food than most 
humans needed, and they gobbled it up faster.

12:36.139 --> 12:37.681
Yeah, I was dumbfounded one time. I didn't get to a 
meal, and the time they marched in and out wasn't

12:37.741 --> 12:44.271
fifteen minutes.

12:46.093 --> 12:55.086
On Thursday, I think it was, every week we had a 
T-bone steak that big, and bread and pies and

12:56.382 --> 12:57.766
cakes. I thought the meals were outstanding from 
my point of view, but the A lot of people, you know,

13:04.803 --> 13:06.225
fuss. I mean, I've seen that all over the world. 
Steamships and everything else. Well, students

13:10.070 --> 13:14.496
today fuss about the food, and there's much more 
variety, I imagine, than you had. There probably

13:14.536 --> 13:17.800
was, and there probably is more variety. I sit here 
the same at Tech. I've been out there for 20 yards a

13:19.182 --> 13:24.809
year, and they complain about the food. But any 
institutional food is going to have to be produced

13:25.330 --> 13:33.240
mass production, and you can't put the delicacy 
into it that you do in home cooking. And a hell of a

13:34.030 --> 13:41.277
lot of them that complained about the food don't 
get as good food at home.

13:44.881 --> 13:48.985
What privileges did upperclassmen enjoy that, 
say, freshmen didn't have? Well, the first thing I

13:49.165 --> 14:00.696
remember is that freshmen couldn't go to town 
except on Saturday afternoon, and upperclassmen

13:49.165 --> 14:00.696
could go in the evening.

14:04.523 --> 14:19.079
I don't know about any other special privilege 
other than they sat at a table where they got

14:04.523 --> 14:19.079
presumably preferred food, and I'm not sure they 
did because I never did inspect it. It never

14:19.099 --> 14:20.281
bothered me. Well, what about the, it was all 
served family style, wasn't it, as far as, what

14:21.121 --> 14:26.207
about passing the food around the table? Yeah, 
they brought it, and they'd have a plate of meat for

14:26.247 --> 14:31.493
so many people that It was family style. You passed 
water around and you got your own milk and your own

14:33.208 --> 14:37.412
coffee. I never drank coffee until my senior year. 
Did upperclassmen get first choice at the meet or

14:42.397 --> 14:45.340
something like that? Yeah, and of course there was 
this

14:45.360 --> 15:01.817
idea if a freshman doesn't behave properly, 
according to their studies, they confiscate his

14:45.360 --> 15:01.817
kush or his dessert. things like that. Today they 
have a custom, and I don't know how old it is, but an

15:05.289 --> 15:18.502
upperclassman, primarily a sophomore, will ask a 
freshman a question, and if he can't answer it by,

15:05.289 --> 15:18.502
say, 5 o'clock or something, then he has to give his 
kush to the upperclassman. Yeah, the similar

15:18.542 --> 15:24.788
things happen, not exactly how they're 
sophisticated, but there'd be some of the similar

15:18.542 --> 15:24.788
lines. In the archives, we get a good number of 
those questions. I think for some of them, there

15:28.712 --> 15:31.875
just are no answers. Ha, ha, ha. Well, you have to 
give up a classroom some credit for your

15:34.197 --> 15:42.349
sophistication.

15:42.469 --> 15:45.134
Did you have any amount of entertainment or 
recreation? We talked a little bit ago about a few

15:45.594 --> 15:49.961
things in the Y and club meetings and so forth. 
While we had the recorder off a minute ago, you

15:50.722 --> 15:58.173
mentioned a lecturer who was there who had an 
influence upon you. Did you have much of that

15:58.213 --> 15:59.395
experience? about once a year or something like 
that. I only remember that. Of course, every

16:03.798 --> 16:18.072
chapel day, that's Christmas, Sunday, we had a 
speaker from a different denomination, and some

16:03.798 --> 16:18.072
of those people were, we had to go to the chapel to 
get the whole core in that little building, if you

16:03.798 --> 16:18.072
remember what it looks like. That was the old 
chapel building? Yeah, the old chapel building.

16:22.296 --> 16:26.180
Now, Diane Hall was built while you were there, and 
that became the new chapel then. Yeah, the new

16:26.200 --> 16:27.021
chapel. And while I was in the, signaled in the last 
phases of that service company, I was stationed in

16:29.513 --> 16:34.099
that chapel. We occupied that chapel. I believe 
they then dubbed it the Armory, didn't they? Yeah.

16:41.087 --> 16:42.669
Did you ever have any movies on campus? Yes, that 
came after the war, I'm pretty sure. Yes, it came

16:50.138 --> 16:51.620
after the war. They had an arbor out there back of 
the in that open space back at the YMCA. We had a

17:02.094 --> 17:05.658
whole couple thousand, I imagine. They'd have 
pictures in there. There were second and

17:07.621 --> 17:10.444
third-run pictures, and we had a few. Some 
students put on plays. There were several of

17:14.269 --> 17:15.211
those. Class put them on to raise some money and 
things of that kind. What sort of things? What did

17:19.616 --> 17:22.420
they raise money for?

17:24.357 --> 17:25.819
I think it was to buy something. I've forgotten 
what that was called. Just be a class gift to the

17:27.041 --> 17:28.744
school or something? Yeah, something of that 
kind. And I can visualize the people that were on

17:32.449 --> 17:36.255
that, and they're all dead. They were on what? On 
that program. The only program, the only thing

17:40.261 --> 17:43.166
they had. They're all passed out. And they were 
younger people, too.

17:51.198 --> 17:52.440
That was a time when... The thing that dominated 
that period was forming of the American Veterans

17:53.787 --> 18:15.695
Association, and

17:53.787 --> 18:15.695
the commandant was married Bazell's sister. What 
was his name? Somewhere along there, Ike Ashburn.

18:21.742 --> 18:22.343
Ike Ashburn. I'd known him for years before he had 
gone to Polytechnic College in Fort Worth as a

18:23.065 --> 18:37.879
barefoot boy when I lived on Bessie Street, which 
was the first street leading to Polytechnic

18:23.065 --> 18:37.879
College. I'd known him ever since he'd gone at that 
period of time in Polytechnic College, and he was a

18:39.861 --> 18:51.672
journalist or what we call a reporter to the 
public, what do you call that, communications He

18:52.192 --> 18:53.534
was in charge of that. On the campus? Yes. Or 
college information office or something like

18:57.658 --> 19:00.221
that. And that was his job. He was a big fella. Six 
feet six and weighed 300 pounds and the jolliest,

19:02.303 --> 19:08.390
kindest person you ever knew. And he and many of the 
faculty went out and took lessons from the Cadet

19:09.291 --> 19:19.583
Corps on drilling. And he went off into this 
training camp over there, and he came back to

19:20.845 --> 19:29.700
college as a full major and made commandant at 
college. And that was 1919 through 19—I don't know

19:29.760 --> 19:38.656
when, how long he stayed there. But he was the

19:38.676 --> 19:45.908
person who seemed to bring the whole spirit of the 
whole thing together, absolutely. All these men

19:49.687 --> 19:53.212
that came back, most of them were dissatisfied. 
Everybody was unhappy. I could imagine that, and I

19:55.935 --> 20:06.189
think this happened again after the Second World 
War, men who had interrupted their schooling to go

19:55.935 --> 20:06.189
off to the war and then come back, and they were 
not... They were at odds and ends. They didn't know

20:07.551 --> 20:13.999
what it was all about, and they were very unhappy. I 
was, too. And to put your finger on it is difficult.

20:21.864 --> 20:27.693
But some were resentful for the treatment they'd 
gotten, the honor or the neglect. Some were

20:28.895 --> 20:34.283
concerned greatly over the loss of people that 
they didn't have. And all of us recognized that

20:35.365 --> 20:39.672
this was a changed environment. It wasn't the same 
old easygoing. atmosphere that we had enjoyed

20:43.972 --> 20:48.899
before, and it never was again, I don't think. And I 
think once you interrupt a pattern of living, you

20:50.221 --> 20:57.330
can't ever re-establish it again. Was there a 
difference, say, in the military discipline

20:58.031 --> 21:03.739
before and after the war? There was less 
discipline after than before. There was more give

21:07.504 --> 21:10.789
and take.

21:14.853 --> 21:22.882
If you, before the war, if you failed to salute, you 
got reprimanded very highly. And after that, it

21:22.962 --> 21:26.726
was all kind of slipshod. It wasn't this great. Was 
there a requirement for each cadet to speak to each

21:28.948 --> 21:33.954
other cadet as he met him on campus then? No, they 
didn't. Sometimes you did, sometimes you didn't.

21:37.958 --> 21:40.761
But I got a taste of that in 1937. I was down there for 
I came down from the University of Pennsylvania to

21:43.507 --> 21:48.575
visit my folks in Fort Worth. And I took that trip 
down to see Dean Kyle. And I couldn't get anything

21:52.221 --> 21:54.564
done. These students come up, introduce 
themselves, and then we tell them who you are. And

21:58.230 --> 22:00.273
the first thing you know, they've taken you over. 
And you don't get anything done. And it was

22:02.737 --> 22:04.019
pleasant. But, by George, I'd be scared to go down. 
And now it's the same thing happening. The same

22:09.568 --> 22:11.691
thing doesn't happen anymore. Quite often you 
walk all the way across campus and no one will speak

22:12.228 --> 22:16.331
to you unless you speak to them first. Well, Lord 
gracious, you couldn't go ten feet then in those

22:16.351 --> 22:19.374
days. Did the cadet officers have any particular 
privileges over the regular cadets?

22:28.602 --> 22:36.088
I think they did, but I can't

22:28.602 --> 22:36.088
pinpoint it. I know that they had more freedom to do 
things than we did. Did

22:42.265 --> 22:48.631
you have any favorite teachers or instructors 
when you were there?

22:51.774 --> 22:57.040
Well, to tell you the truth, I think they were all my 
favorites.

22:58.621 --> 23:09.792
Even the severest one, the man we had in chemistry 
that plunked, I think, 80% of his students for his

22:58.621 --> 23:09.792
entire career. People disliked him, but I was 
assistant to a man who was in charge of keeping the

23:10.480 --> 23:20.271
chemistry building in order. And I worked for 20 
cents an hour, odd hours. And I loved that man. He

23:29.201 --> 23:32.464
was a little fellow, and he was very didactic. He 
had everything exactly. Chemistry was so

23:34.667 --> 23:39.272
precise, the way he presented it, the average 
person couldn't conceive of it, you see. And

23:41.897 --> 23:54.971
because the president gave us a lecture before his 
class started saying that it took a superior mind

23:41.897 --> 23:54.971
to, if you were proficient in chemistry, you had a 
superior mind. And because I wasn't, I had an

23:55.051 --> 24:01.898
inferiority complex, although I worked in the 
building. But the other chemistry teachers I

24:01.918 --> 24:07.504
thought were just, well, we were just like 
buddies. And Dr. Hedges, C.C. Hedges, I wonder if

24:09.847 --> 24:12.451
he's still living. I'm not sure. I would like to 
know. I have thought for years I would go down to see

24:14.614 --> 24:18.018
him. He was chemical engineer. He was in charge of 
the whole chemistry division. And Duke Thornton.

24:25.728 --> 24:27.070
Duke Thornton is still living. I want to see him 
someday. He was just a young man in the chemistry

24:28.652 --> 24:35.922
department the last two years I was there. The 
others I can remember, but I can't remember the

24:36.222 --> 24:41.191
names. And the catalog that would have refreshed 
my memory I have searched all over the place for,

24:41.211 --> 24:58.483
and I have suspicion that I gave them with a ton of 
other stuff to the Southwest collection here.

24:59.813 --> 25:00.474
Okay. What was the general attitude of the 
students toward the administration? And I guess

25:04.877 --> 25:14.405
this would be a dual kind of thing, one to President 
Bezell for the education administration and one

25:04.877 --> 25:14.405
to the commandant, to the bull for the military. 
Isn't that

25:15.426 --> 25:20.050
the same?

25:25.255 --> 25:28.057
I don't know that there was any conflict. I can't 
put my finger on it. I know I got a dream I wanted to

25:30.307 --> 25:45.521
take some plants that I had developed over in the 
horticulture, take them home and transplant them

25:30.307 --> 25:45.521
on this farm, and I couldn't get any. The 
commandant turned me down,

25:47.723 --> 25:59.453
and I went to Wiesel's office to ask him about it, 
and he scolded me plenty. But the upshot of it was,

26:01.458 --> 26:07.505
the commandant said, all right, go ahead. Get back 
in three days. And I did. But that's the only

26:12.511 --> 26:14.694
conflict I ever had with them. And Dr. Buzell, in 
later years, after that year, that was my freshman

26:14.754 --> 26:26.928
year, he was always very, very careful, very 
thoughtful. And I stayed there one summer. and got

26:31.968 --> 26:34.110
to know him and his family. So I always felt very 
fond of Dr. Brazell, Dr. Hedges, Dr.

26:36.152 --> 27:00.679
Francis, and his left and right arm was

26:36.152 --> 27:00.679
Marsteller. I had War Courses under Marsteller, 
and he used to raise cane with me, and I thought he

27:04.030 --> 27:14.583
was great.

27:14.603 --> 27:19.329
He was a rough speaking person, but he was a very 
gentle, fine person. His father-in-law was Deke

27:19.349 --> 27:27.779
Fountain, who was head of English, and Dean 
Fountain and I were buddies. I liked every one of my

27:29.401 --> 27:33.987
teachers, and I often wondered where they've 
what's happened. I know that Hensel and Potts in

27:35.394 --> 27:49.170
the horticulture are both gone, and I

27:35.394 --> 27:49.170
just wonder about hedges. I'd just like to see 
hedges. I'm not sure whether he's still there.

27:53.485 --> 28:05.918
Duke Thornton, I know is, because my assistant 
interviewed him this summer on his career there as

27:53.485 --> 28:05.918
a teacher, and he gave us some rather interesting 
insights into life in Bachelor Hall, for example,

27:53.485 --> 28:05.918
and things of that nature. Entomology,

28:06.178 --> 28:18.790
he married Miss Merriman back in, that's after I 
left college. He was, in anthropology, was

28:19.411 --> 28:22.555
Bilzing. Bilzing was a wonderful person.

28:29.365 --> 28:37.516
I had an English teacher my senior year on public 
speaking, and I thought he was great. Looking back

28:37.897 --> 28:48.692
on people like Puryear, who was assistant to the 
president when I went there, you know, he was a

28:37.897 --> 28:48.692
mathematician.

28:50.174 --> 28:55.238
Oh, who was that in engineering and history? I knew 
those people, but I was not necessarily a student

28:56.319 --> 29:01.824
of theirs. But

29:02.805 --> 29:12.614
those people treated you as if you were their own 
kid. That's the kind of attitude we had there.

29:15.256 --> 29:20.080
There's a pretty close working and social 
relationship between the students and the

29:15.256 --> 29:20.080
faculty. I always found it so. Were there any girls 
in any of the classes that you attended? No,

29:25.827 --> 29:26.908
whatsoever. The only girls on the campus that year 
was three or four who worked in the home

29:26.928 --> 29:44.009
demonstration department who were housed in that 
building across the street from Speza Hall, what

29:26.928 --> 29:44.009
we call that building. It was one of the first 
buildings on the campus, a four-story building.

29:47.667 --> 29:48.869
French-type building. What was the name of that? I 
can't remember. Gathright. It was Gathright.

29:53.095 --> 29:55.138
Gathright. They were housed in that, and they came 
out from town on the interurban. One girl, Ruth

30:01.747 --> 30:14.726
Cannon, was secretary to the registrar, who 
was—the

30:01.747 --> 30:14.726
registrar was—I can't call his name offhand. I 
can't remember it either. preceded H.L. Heaton,

30:17.781 --> 30:21.565
who... Yeah, well, just a minute, I'll get to it. 
But Ruth Cannon, during the war, in 1918, married

30:22.185 --> 30:31.835
Runt Stangle.

30:31.855 --> 30:42.366
And I always remember that we almost had a 
celebration in our company because we thought

30:31.855 --> 30:42.366
that was the greatest thing that ever happened. 
Ruth Runt Stangle and Ruth Cannon got married.

30:47.000 --> 30:49.005
That was the most beautiful couple.

30:51.811 --> 30:55.199
And of course, Ron Stangle is the reason why I'm 
here. Because out of curiosity, I came to visit

30:56.202 --> 31:04.722
Tech in 1937 to see him because I heard he was here.
