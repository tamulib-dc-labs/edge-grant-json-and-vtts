WEBVTT

00:01.263 --> 00:15.520
because

00:01.263 --> 00:15.520
the Texas and Southwestern cattle raisers in 
their executive committee say, well, you know,

00:01.263 --> 00:15.520
these youngsters have had eight years of college, 
but now they should know everything. Yeah, right.

00:16.280 --> 00:19.845
Oh, sure.

00:19.885 --> 00:22.948
Okay, so that's as far as our pressures on the 
clinical. How about the pressures on the

00:23.249 --> 00:28.715
research, which you said was another one of the 
aims that you wanted to improve? Well, as I

00:29.436 --> 00:30.477
mentioned, When I came here, and you've 
interviewed Dr. Price, and you mentioned that he

00:30.693 --> 00:42.024
left you with a perception of the growth of the 
college. And it had been phenomenal. And the

00:44.486 --> 00:52.253
physical plant had grown not as much as it should 
have, but certainly it had grown substantially.

00:52.934 --> 00:57.038
And the numbers of students had become 
overwhelming. biggest in the nation. We were on an

00:59.110 --> 01:03.035
accelerated program where they finished in three 
years. We had started a

01:03.736 --> 01:10.705
undergraduate program in biomedical science. 
And so we had students running out of our ears. And

01:14.610 --> 01:23.302
in this complex at one time or another, we had 
1,500, 1,600 students, which is unbelievable for

01:14.610 --> 01:23.302
a professional school. Most veterinary schools 
think in terms of working with only 500 or 600

01:26.397 --> 01:31.082
students at best. So our teaching program was 
enormous. Our faculty, many of them were spending

01:34.686 --> 01:44.776
16, 18, 20 hours a week actually in laboratory 
lecture facing students. My goodness. That

01:46.778 --> 01:48.640
didn't leave any time for us. It doesn't. That's 
right. So what we had was a teaching mill. We had a

01:54.123 --> 02:07.778
few professors that had joint appointments with 
the Agricultural Experiment Station, or

01:54.123 --> 02:07.778
something like that, where there may be 50% 
research that could find a little time to do

01:54.123 --> 02:07.778
research. But 80% of our faculty were doing none, 
or very little. And we were so oriented toward the

02:13.805 --> 02:22.915
teaching program that it was very difficult to 
find time for the faculty And even more difficult

02:23.401 --> 02:33.292
than finding time was changing the orientation, 
changing the direction of the faculty. They had

02:33.312 --> 02:34.814
gotten into a habit. They had gotten into a rut. And 
that trimester system just rolled over like a

02:37.297 --> 02:41.021
wheel in a rut. And you'd turn over three times in a 
year. And then you'd just keep right down that rut.

02:46.668 --> 02:52.294
And I remember one of my first eye-opening 
experiences came to Texas A&M. I had a young

02:54.995 --> 03:10.633
faculty member that, probably 35 years old, and he 
had just come back from Iowa State with a new PhD two

02:54.995 --> 03:10.633
or three years before, a few years before. And one 
night at a social function, I asked him, I said, how

03:10.653 --> 03:22.146
can we shift the emphasis of our program and get 
more research going? And he looked me straight in

03:23.105 --> 03:25.067
the eye and said, why should I? Or why should we? Now 
I knew I had a problem. Because, you know, that

03:29.573 --> 03:37.643
never dawned on me that a young man of that 
background and orientation would question why we

03:29.573 --> 03:37.643
should need more research. But, you know, he 
looked me in the eye and said, why should we? And

03:41.207 --> 03:44.071
that's when I knew I had a problem. Because what he 
was really reflecting was the attitude of a lot of

03:44.091 --> 03:48.496
the faculty. So it's been... hard battle. Dr. 
Price made a noble effort to move this before he

03:54.558 --> 04:04.396
stepped out when he brought Dr. Maurer

03:54.558 --> 04:04.396
here. He had done a noble effort and he had

04:04.416 --> 04:13.311
jarred a few cracks open But, boy, it was still a 
long way to go. And it has still been a long way to go,

04:16.799 --> 04:19.523
and it still is. And what steps have you taken? I 
mean, have you given them some release time or

04:21.466 --> 04:26.292
maybe more sabbatical-type time? Because 
research just consumes so much time. Well, Terry,

04:32.582 --> 04:39.872
I guess the thing is, I've done all I could, but the 
biggest nightmare has been...

04:41.236 --> 04:49.045
overcoming attitudes, overcoming attitudes of 
faculty and overcoming attitudes of department

04:41.236 --> 04:49.045
heads. We fight like mad to keep all our positions 
filled, because it's only by keeping positions

04:49.706 --> 05:08.188
filled that we are able to have time to give faculty 
members relief for a semester, like those that are

04:49.706 --> 05:08.188
in the block training system in the clinic. What we 
try to do is give every faculty member over three

05:08.658 --> 05:17.208
blocks of the 10 off, that's 15 weeks a year, that 
they're free of teaching. So that gives them some

05:18.770 --> 05:24.417
time for scholarship or self-study, 
self-improvement. And if they can get some

05:24.437 --> 05:26.479
research in there, fine. But we've tried, like 
everything, to add a few new positions. It's been

05:33.207 --> 05:35.289
tough to add positions. And the difficulty there 
is this. We're under the formula and under all the

05:38.594 --> 05:53.438
teaching load reports, and we can only justify new 
positions by student

05:38.594 --> 05:53.438
enrollment, really, and student credit hours 
taught. So if you do that, then you sort of catch 22.

05:57.084 --> 05:59.848
Yeah, exactly. You're right where you started 
again. So it's been a difficult thing. It's a

06:05.335 --> 06:06.896
problem with the legislature, then. Yeah, the 
Texas legislature, as you well know, and I'm sure

06:07.277 --> 06:12.061
you hear this all the time. They really don't 
believe in research. No. And, for instance, the

06:15.985 --> 06:24.513
organized research, you know how little they fund 
that and how repeatedly they've quacked at it and

06:15.985 --> 06:24.513
tried to cut it out. And all that is is just a little 
seed money for young teachers to try to get them

06:25.273 --> 06:29.217
started. And it the best investment that state 
could make. But the organized research is a

06:35.462 --> 06:59.031
stepchild and it, you know, they get up over there 
and they talk about how some of those dollars have

06:35.462 --> 06:59.031
been used or some professor could study the color 
of lizard coats and tree lizard or something, you

06:35.462 --> 06:59.031
know, and they think they're being funny because 
they don't understand research and they don't

06:35.462 --> 06:59.031
understand what it means. So The only approaches 
that we've had a little luck with, and I think where

07:01.923 --> 07:21.483
we've made the most progress, is by recruiting 
young faculty from other institutions that know

07:01.923 --> 07:21.483
the importance of it and who are willing to do the 
extra work, walk the extra mile to get started. And

07:22.343 --> 07:29.871
once you can ever get the start where you can get 
some sponsored research money and you can relieve

07:30.475 --> 07:34.720
a part of a person's salary to leave them on to a 
research program. Then you can build from that,

07:36.122 --> 07:39.446
and you relieve their faculty time. You let you 
hire some other teachers to do the teaching. And

07:42.791 --> 07:49.118
this is how the College of Engineering has been 
able to do it, and some others that have been more

07:42.791 --> 07:49.118
successful than we have. College of Geoscience 
has been able to do it. Part of me, they have

07:52.863 --> 07:57.990
sponsors where they can get research money better 
than we can. We're fighting a tough market. right

08:00.125 --> 08:01.888
now. It would have been so much easier to have done 
it in the 60s. When there was more money. When there

08:05.714 --> 08:06.956
was more research money. But for whatever reason, 
and I don't know what the political pressures were

08:08.719 --> 08:19.356
on Dr. Price and the executive committee in the 
60s, but for whatever reason they decided to

08:08.719 --> 08:19.356
expand enrollment. And there was a great pressure 
to expand enrollment. Whatever there was, they

08:22.581 --> 08:25.626
did that and they didn't push research. for 
whatever reason. And so you'd consider yourself

08:28.061 --> 08:31.386
the first dean then to push research? Oh, I don't 
know, because Dr. Price... Emphasize, we'll say.

08:36.454 --> 08:38.156
I pushed a little harder than Dr. Price did. Dr. 
Price was trying, you know. I sure want to be fair,

08:40.900 --> 08:46.148
because he began to, he set the rules in motion, and 
he was trying. Perhaps I'm the first one that's

08:47.690 --> 08:52.457
made more fuss about it, trying... Some of the 
faculty members say it's all I care about. That's

08:56.612 --> 08:57.353
not right. I've tried to bring balance. I believe 
in strong teaching as much as anybody, but I've

09:00.438 --> 09:14.378
tried to bring balance to the program, try to 
improve our clinical training program, try to

09:00.438 --> 09:14.378
improve our research effort without damaging our 
teaching program. How many hours a week, or what's

09:19.756 --> 09:26.465
the course load for an assistant professor, the 
average professor? Well, it varies all over the

09:27.086 --> 09:39.362
place because our teaching is so much different 
from, say, history or sociology or political

09:27.086 --> 09:39.362
science or engineering even, although it's more 
like engineering. We have so many lab hours. So

09:42.526 --> 09:45.850
much of our teaching has to be done, especially in 
the clinical area, in small, very narrow

09:46.673 --> 09:52.379
student-teacher ratios, one to three, one to 
four. And that's expensive and time-consuming.

09:58.385 --> 10:02.830
Because our profession is esoteric. The graduate 
immediately enters a field of private practice,

10:02.850 --> 10:14.942
and the average client doesn't really know what a 
veterinary knows what his training is, just like

10:15.952 --> 10:18.956
medicine. And so there's a great demand for 
quality control. And that's what we've been able

10:23.822 --> 10:39.722
to do in American schools that they don't do in some 
other places like Mexico or Italy or so forth when

10:23.822 --> 10:39.722
they'll take classes of 500 students and lecture 
to them. They don't know whether they've learned

10:39.822 --> 10:41.744
anything or not. We have the very... Narrow 
student-teacher ratios in the clinical sciences

10:45.095 --> 11:08.827
where the instructor works closely with the 
individual to know whether they can do surgery or

10:45.095 --> 11:08.827
not, whether they can operate a radiological 
equipment, whether they can operate an

10:45.095 --> 11:08.827
anesthetic machine without killing the patient. 
And these things have to be done almost like a

11:08.847 --> 11:14.595
one-on-one, one-on-three, something like that. 
And so I'd say try to get back to your question. I

11:19.787 --> 11:23.351
feel that it, and I think it varies a great deal. 
Yes, ma'am. Excuse me. Your 11 o'clock

11:25.874 --> 11:26.896
appointment's here. All right. Thank you. I feel 
that it

11:28.838 --> 11:45.139
varies, but somehow a teacher shouldn't have to 
face students, whether in the lecture room or the

11:28.838 --> 11:45.139
lavatory or on rounds in the clinic. He or she 
shouldn't have to face students more than about 15

11:46.537 --> 11:53.450
hours a week, whatever system, whatever shape. 
But now I know a lot of our clinicians do. Some of

11:57.337 --> 12:01.686
them are 20, 25 hours a week. That must be draining. 
It is, very draining, very draining. It's just too

12:06.956 --> 12:09.220
much. They need time for reflection, time for 
thought, time for preparation, time for study,

12:09.503 --> 12:17.874
time for self-development. It's so hard to do. 
We've tried to improve some by bringing in the

12:20.297 --> 12:23.982
residency training program. We bring the young 
veterinarians in for two and three years of

12:24.743 --> 12:29.529
postgraduate training. And when did you start 
this program? We started in about 75. And now we

12:34.896 --> 12:39.342
have about 20 students in residency training. And 
they give some of the clinicians, the senior

12:39.980 --> 12:44.766
staff, some relief. And you bring these men and 
women right out of the field then? Well, they

12:50.312 --> 12:57.320
either come through a one-year internship, or 
they may take their internship in a private

12:50.312 --> 12:57.320
practice. But when we bring them into residency, 
they've had at least one year experience

12:58.081 --> 13:05.970
post-graduate. And then they go into a residency 
program of two or three years. And this moves them

13:10.424 --> 13:22.184
towards certification in one of the 12 colleges, 
specialty colleges, like surgery, internal

13:10.424 --> 13:22.184
medicine, radiology, pathology, and on and on. 
That's a great idea. Was that your idea,

13:24.728 --> 13:25.911
basically? Well, it was my idea to try to build a 
residency program because we didn't have one when

13:27.093 --> 13:32.582
I came here. But I can't claim, you know, I couldn't 
claim ID for the residency program because they

13:32.849 --> 13:39.538
started in other schools before. Oh, I see. That 
sounds like, that's more like a medical doctor

13:42.682 --> 13:46.788
residency training. Pattern after pattern, very 
similar. And a way to, so the young person can

13:51.094 --> 13:54.458
specialize. Yeah. It's been another way to push 
back the curtain of ignorance into clinical

13:55.199 --> 14:00.907
sciences. Mm-hmm. uh, as different from the 
traditional graduate program, the master's and

14:02.414 --> 14:09.124
PhD research program. This is more oriented 
toward the service or clinical program. But

14:13.511 --> 14:15.594
we've, uh, we felt that they've helped us. It's 
helped us a great deal in two respects. One, it's

14:18.778 --> 14:31.898
taken some weight off of the senior faculty, uh, 
facing students, as I mentioned, so many hours a

14:18.778 --> 14:31.898
day, but also those young minds are the most 
progressive, probing young minds in the, in the

14:18.778 --> 14:31.898
field. And they stimulate the older professor, 
too. So it's been good. I think it would be

14:36.299 --> 14:37.500
tremendous. I think it's an excellent idea. It's 
been helpful, very helpful. And how many a year do

14:40.403 --> 14:41.745
we have? Well, we have about, let's see, I think 
about 22 residents right now. No, no, 22 interns

14:51.955 --> 14:54.898
and residents. We have four interns and the rest 
are residents, so 22 altogether. And we graduate

15:02.185 --> 15:08.933
each year about, there'll be about three in the 
large animal finish and about three in small. Each

15:09.534 --> 15:11.196
year we'll have two to three finish. And they go on 
to become faculty members somewhere else or they

15:12.297 --> 15:16.823
may go into specialty practice. They get their 
boards in a couple of years after they finish here.

15:22.249 --> 15:23.090
Sounds like an excellent. Do we have a couple more 
minutes or do we have to quit? Yeah. If you can, or we

15:29.742 --> 15:42.018
could... No, I just want to ask you about those 
residency training, the clinical aspects, sound

15:29.742 --> 15:42.018
like a couple of your accomplishments. What else 
would you consider your accomplishments? And

15:44.180 --> 15:48.726
then let's talk about some things that you might 
consider your shortcomings as the dean.

15:51.950 --> 15:58.939
Well, I guess strengthening the clinical program 
has been my... I guess something I could point to

16:00.269 --> 16:03.435
that, well, I didn't do. I've helped and aided to 
accomplish. Dean never does anything really. He

16:09.025 --> 16:11.209
just creates the environment to get it done. Put 
some weight behind it. Yeah. Leans. There's leans

16:14.815 --> 16:18.141
and lashes a little in there. That has been one. I 
think I would have to. I would say that I have been

16:23.590 --> 16:41.348
able to build better bridges with the state, the 
industry, and so forth by working hard to build the

16:23.590 --> 16:41.348
bridges with the commodity groups, industrial 
groups, by our advisory board development. We've

16:41.868 --> 16:51.758
moved ahead in development, private sector 
creation of a development council.

16:52.109 --> 16:55.633
We've improved our research, I think, some. And 
I'll put that on the negative side, too, because

16:56.794 --> 17:00.097
not enough. But I think we've made some progress. 
We had pretty good progress with the Institute of

17:02.600 --> 17:12.290
Comparative Medicine, a joint effort with Baylor 
until the governor shot it down two years ago. But

17:13.111 --> 17:20.378
that allowed us to improve our research efforts 
and bring some faculty in we couldn't have brought

17:13.111 --> 17:20.378
in otherwise. Was it too expensive for Clements? 
Oh, the governor just got it because he had run on a

17:24.517 --> 17:33.908
political promise of cutting taxes, and it was 
vulnerable to his red pencil. So he cut it out in

17:34.870 --> 17:36.752
1979. It was another one of those 5% waste things.

17:42.639 --> 17:43.881
Yeah. He ran on Proposition 13 in Texas, where we 
had the lowest tax base in the country. But that's

17:49.906 --> 17:51.849
part of this business. You win some and you lose 
some. But I think we have improved our research

17:56.035 --> 18:02.625
effort to some degree and had some success with it. 
I think we've built a better bridge with the

18:04.208 --> 18:08.294
industry. Certainly not what I'd like to see, but I 
think it's a lot better. I think we're working

18:13.863 --> 18:18.630
better with the especially with the Texas 
Agricultural Experiment Station. And we've

18:23.833 --> 18:39.247
developed some interdepartmental research 
programs in the college, like the one we have going

18:23.833 --> 18:39.247
with brucellosis, which is a substantial name, a 
good effort, giving us national visibility. So,

18:39.267 --> 18:48.175
yes, I think we've been able to improve our 
clinical program, and overall we've improved our

18:39.267 --> 18:48.175
research program. And those were two goals that I 
came here with. And I think we've been fairly

18:52.805 --> 18:56.050
successful. I guess I also saw after coming here 
that we needed to move away from the accelerated

18:56.070 --> 19:03.321
program. So we're moving away from that. I think 
that was an accomplishment for Dr. Price in early

19:06.987 --> 19:12.555
60s. On the flip side of the coin, I think it's 
almost an accomplishment for me or for our current

19:17.588 --> 19:24.801
administration, executive committee, to go back 
because I think it had outlived its usefulness. So

19:26.764 --> 19:29.809
in other words, we're keeping a flexible 
administration. That's right. In terms of the

19:31.552 --> 19:32.554
times. Oh, yes. No way to get a rigid one. We have to 
respond to changing times and changing needs. How

19:41.348 --> 19:42.409
about shortcomings? Things that you wanted to do, 
but you, well, you said research, for example. You

19:45.673 --> 19:49.858
want to get more research time, and you want to have 
more people doing research. I want to see the

19:49.878 --> 19:52.160
research program better. I want to see more people 
here with national visibility in research. I

19:57.006 --> 20:00.450
think we have a state, the economy, the resources. 
We ought to be stronger in research. I hope that in

20:03.213 --> 20:09.921
the next few years, we can keep moving in that way. 
step out of here in a few years, I can at least feel

20:10.137 --> 20:14.862
that it's moving in that direction. So I want to see 
the research effort build and do much better than

20:15.763 --> 20:21.229
it has so far. I still would like to see us improve 
our program and food animal medicine more than we

20:22.110 --> 20:26.534
have. And we have to do that. We have to get some 
better leadership there. We have a number of

20:33.382 --> 20:38.507
people getting on toward retirement, maybe with 
their When those people step down, we can find some

20:39.247 --> 20:45.273
stronger leadership in food animal medicine. 
It's been tough because the faculty there is

20:45.733 --> 20:49.797
getting a bit old. Other areas that I think there's 
a need for curricular change, a substantial

20:52.259 --> 21:04.371
curriculum change, and

20:52.259 --> 21:04.371
I don't know. We've had a curriculum committee. 
We've pushed them pretty hard into it. in-depth

21:08.339 --> 21:11.842
study for the last three years now. And at times, it 
seems like maybe we're making some breakthrough.

21:16.026 --> 21:19.329
But we need change in two areas. Number one, a 
curriculum more attuned to the needs of the last

21:19.409 --> 21:29.739
decade of this century and the first decade of the 
next century. And also, we need improvement in our

21:30.599 --> 21:33.442
teaching methods. We're still kind of obsolete 
there. I'm hoping that shifting back to a

21:38.191 --> 21:46.402
four-year curriculum, maybe getting some time 
for people to have some time in the summers to work

21:38.191 --> 21:46.402
on instructional methods will help. And that's 
one of the reasons I would have to say I fought hard

21:48.405 --> 21:55.254
to leave the accelerated program. And I say that in 
all due respect to Dr. Price and the people that in

21:55.274 --> 22:03.906
the early 1960s saw fit to go that way. But I sure saw 
fit to go out. And it's been tough to do that. It

22:08.414 --> 22:10.577
hadn't been easy. We need more time for reflection 
and for research, then.

22:16.727 --> 22:18.089
I'm not sure I'm following your question. More 
time for reflection, for teaching methods, and

22:18.109 --> 22:29.466
staying on top of your discipline and your subject 
matter, more time to read the material, and more

22:18.109 --> 22:29.466
time for the professor to do the research. Oh, 
yeah. Those are the reasons, I think. We're

22:31.790 --> 22:34.234
shifting the focus now. Yeah. Those are the 
justifications, I think. Now, if you had to rank

22:37.372 --> 22:44.378
Texas A&M, I know it's the largest student body as 
far as the largest vet school in the country. If you

22:44.864 --> 22:48.649
had to rank it along teaching and research, how 
would you rank it? My students come in all the time.

22:51.173 --> 22:53.076
I have a lot of pre-vet students. They're 
excellent students. They come in there. They're

22:54.898 --> 22:55.539
eager. They want to know how to improve in my 
course. It's a pleasure to have them. And they

22:58.644 --> 23:02.589
always want to know, tell me everything you know 
about the vet school. So I want to get it firsthand.

23:04.973 --> 23:06.255
They say, I know it's the largest. I don't know how a 
professional, though, would rank it. Well, we're

23:09.519 --> 23:14.787
not, in my opinion, we're not the top school by a 
substantial number. And we're not the bottom by a

23:15.442 --> 23:18.585
hell of a long way either. I guess, and I know they 
have some weaknesses just like we do, I guess I'd

23:20.947 --> 23:30.255
rank California Davis top overall.

23:34.339 --> 23:38.763
In research, then I'd put Cornell probably 
second. Cornell might even be first in research.

23:45.175 --> 24:00.616
in the orientation toward comparative medicine, 
orientation with human medicine, and from a

23:45.175 --> 24:00.616
strictly overall

23:45.175 --> 24:00.616
scholarship, I'd rank University of 
Pennsylvania second or third. So Davis,

24:01.958 --> 24:06.023
Pennsylvania, and Cornell, some combination. 
Although I think our clinical program and our

24:06.544 --> 24:12.072
teaching program might be stronger than Cornell. 
I'd place us in right below that tier. The next

24:15.392 --> 24:19.599
group of three or four. I'd place Texas A&M, Ohio 
State, Iowa State in that tier.

24:28.032 --> 24:31.277
I could point out areas that we're probably 
stronger than any. Okay, would you do that for me?

24:34.742 --> 24:42.013
Well, I really think from the standpoint of our 
students being ready to move into the business

24:34.742 --> 24:42.013
world or to the professional world of practice to 
go to work the day they graduate, I really think our

24:42.803 --> 24:55.320
graduates may be at the top of the whole box.

24:55.540 --> 25:04.733
But from the standpoint of the in-depth 
education, I'm not sure that's true.

25:07.417 --> 25:10.701
And I think we're still suffering from the effects 
of the accelerated program. I would hope that in

25:11.356 --> 25:27.230
four to five years that we could say that our 
overall teaching, research, and service, judged

25:11.356 --> 25:27.230
on all three, that we'd be either tops or among the 
top three. And I don't think that's unreasonable.

25:29.492 --> 25:30.954
Some people might say we're there now. I don't 
think we are. Because I think we're still

25:33.296 --> 25:34.797
lopsided.

25:37.259 --> 25:41.363
But I think it's, see, we'll be back on a four-year 
curriculum. in 1982. And I think from there,

25:44.088 --> 25:56.183
within another three years, if we can keep getting 
the resources that we need, we can be among the top

25:44.088 --> 25:56.183
three. Because right now, I know Cornell's having 
problems keeping their standard. They still have

26:01.289 --> 26:03.091
the strong research program. They have a much 
smaller school than we do. They only take 75

26:06.275 --> 26:07.857
students. And so as a result, maybe they are able to 
give a little more in-depth training than we are.

26:15.484 --> 26:18.988
But I think we can be a moment. Sounds like you have 
your challenges for the future. Well,

26:21.030 --> 26:27.456
are there some other issues? These are basically 
the things that I wanted to talk about. Are there

26:30.399 --> 26:34.904
other issues that you might want to explore in a 
later interview? Or do you think we should close it

26:34.924 --> 26:36.745
at this? Are there other things that you'd like to 
say? Up ahead, I don't know, Terry. I don't know. I

26:40.825 --> 26:43.490
couldn't say there are. Well, maybe you should 
read the transcript. All right. Well, thanks a

26:47.278 --> 26:47.899
lot. If after, when you're all ready to close, you 
have other questions, well, I'd be glad to try to

26:47.919 --> 26:57.218
answer them or chat with you about them. But I don't 
know of anything else. One last thing, and that is,

26:59.558 --> 27:07.725
why are more students, why is vet school, entrance 
into vet school, more competitive today than

26:59.558 --> 27:07.725
medical school? It seems like the last 10 years, 
maybe even longer, there's just been this great

27:08.426 --> 27:17.274
surge of students who want to go to vet school. It 
has dropped off some. It is beginning to drop off.

27:20.397 --> 27:20.997
But you're right. I'm not sure. I've thought about 
that a lot and theorized. I have some theories

27:28.955 --> 27:29.996
about it. I think that we had a reaction from the 68 
to 70 time, when all the young people were striving

27:31.998 --> 27:49.757
for relevancy, trying to see some value to why they 
were working, to life. They tried to turn back to

27:50.257 --> 27:52.960
nature. They swarmed into courses like what 
diseases of fish and wildlife when there weren't

27:57.018 --> 28:02.446
any jobs there. There weren't enough jobs there. 
As a result of books like James Harold's All

28:07.794 --> 28:23.317
Creatures Great and Small, I could see maybe some 
basic values in being able to administer to the

28:07.794 --> 28:23.317
health and well-being of animals. And then, of 
course, That almost assumed an equal rank with

28:26.954 --> 28:34.345
medicine for a lot of young people. Many of them 
sort of were turned off to medicine because they

28:35.507 --> 28:45.382
had the image that medicine was so monetary and so 
financially oriented. Well, I don't know. But of

28:49.268 --> 28:54.936
course, there were only, at that time, 18 
veterinary schools, and there were 120 medical

28:49.268 --> 28:54.936
schools. It was harder to get into veterinary 
schools because of the numbers. And so that built

29:00.095 --> 29:03.881
an artificial situation that we've had to deal 
with. And we talked about it earlier this morning.

29:08.768 --> 29:10.190
But that was a factor. I guess that was part of it. So 
now you think that it's on the decline? It's

29:16.499 --> 29:17.581
tipping away from that. Many states, the numbers 
have dropped off. Marketly, we haven't seen much

29:21.988 --> 29:24.231
drop off. On the other hand, we haven't had any 
increase either. In fact, I guess we have about 100

29:27.245 --> 29:33.272
less applicants now than we did at the peak. But 
still, you have about 600 who are qualified. About

29:36.535 --> 29:37.436
500 now. Oh, so it has dropped down. Yeah, from 600. 
Slightly under five now, where one time it was six.

29:45.245 --> 29:46.166
So we're down 100. Do you see this as a tendency for 
the future? Do you think it's going to drop down a

29:47.387 --> 29:49.089
little bit more? I would anticipate that it will. I 
think it will. and everything goes in cycles.

29:57.688 --> 29:59.798
Sure, sure. Well, thanks a lot for this interview. 
I really appreciate it. My pleasure.
