00:02.258 --> 00:05.042
Let me set this up here. Brief biographical sketch 
of yourself and your schooling.

00:11.412 --> 00:12.854
Do I need to give my name and everything? Sure. OK. 
Name's Sterling Wheeler. Brief biographical

00:15.157 --> 00:20.486
sketch, starting with schooling only. Sounds OK. 
Just schooling at Texas A&E. I've got my

00:23.170 --> 00:27.196
bachelor's in environmental design there in 77. 
Received my master's in urban planning in 79. And

00:32.349 --> 00:41.699
to

00:32.349 --> 00:41.699
give you history before that, I was born and raised 
in South Texas, Corpus Christi. And

00:41.939 --> 00:48.386
then after my schooling, I ended up in Dallas. And 
I've been here a year and a half.

00:56.755 --> 01:00.840
Basically, there's not a whole lot to say. OK. 
Which of these questions do you think you could

01:02.384 --> 01:07.491
best cover? How about number nine? Do you know how 
many planters are now employed? That fluctuates

01:11.637 --> 01:13.159
somewhat. I could check on that. I have to go ask our 
clerk.

01:21.610 --> 01:22.912
You want me to go check on that now? I could get that 
for you. The department, I think, has around 80

01:27.619 --> 01:32.205
people, but I don't know how many of those are 
professionals. at

01:32.405 --> 01:38.714
least 40 to 50, somewhere in there, but I can get an 
exact number. We've had a couple people leave

01:39.455 --> 01:41.998
recently. Three people leave. Okay. Is there any 
systematic periodic review of your city's comp

01:46.905 --> 01:51.952
plan? We don't have a comp plan, and therefore 
there's no periodic review. Okay, so... Then...

02:00.721 --> 02:09.370
Obviously, since your city does not conduct 
comprehensive planning, how would you

02:00.721 --> 02:09.370
characterize this planning stuff?

02:09.410 --> 02:11.131
For example, incremental or radical? What is 
radical planning?

02:16.817 --> 02:17.157
That's a .

02:21.722 --> 02:23.123
I guess it's incremental planning. We are 
reactionary. We don't really plan for problems.

02:30.353 --> 02:36.598
If a problem occurs or an issue comes up, we then 
initiate a study. Most of our studies are

02:37.159 --> 02:43.324
initiated through either the planning 
commission stating that there's a problem.

02:43.525 --> 02:49.510
Therefore, you, the planning department, have to 
study the problem and come up with

02:43.525 --> 02:49.510
recommendations. And that usually comes out of 
zoning cases, sometimes subdivision cases, but

02:49.530 --> 02:55.775
seldom subdivision cases. Or the city council 
thinks there's a problem. And they tell the

02:59.480 --> 03:05.448
planning commission, who relays it to us, we do a 
study. Or we see there's a problem and we ask the

03:05.468 --> 03:14.620
planning commission if we can initiate a study, or 
we initiate it on our own. An example is our only

03:14.640 --> 03:24.593
adopted land use plan, which is the Kleberg 
Community. plan, which that's the first plan I

03:24.944 --> 03:28.769
worked on when I came here. It was initiated when 
the city consolidated with the former city of

03:29.710 --> 03:34.456
Kleberg. We had to solve some zoning questions. 
Kleberg had its own zoning ordinance. As part of

03:42.446 --> 03:48.353
the state statute of consolidation, you have to 
adopt that city's ordinances for a period of time

03:49.058 --> 03:53.325
during a transition period. So we adopted 
Kleberg's ordinance. And it wasn't real

03:56.230 --> 04:09.754
compatible with the Dallas ordinance, so we 
conducted a land use study to determine proper

03:56.230 --> 04:09.754
zoning of the area. So we did a little land use 
study, got citizen participation,

04:15.755 --> 04:17.878
As a result, we had a land use plan. And based on the 
land use plan, we developed a zoning proposal and

04:18.158 --> 04:33.438
changed Kleberg zoning to Dallas zoning, 
essentially.

04:33.458 --> 04:34.639
That's basically how we operate. It's 
reactionary.

04:38.604 --> 04:43.230
We really don't have any type of comprehensive or 
long-range outlook at this time. We would like to,

04:44.206 --> 04:52.278
and our work program was geared into developing a 
comprehensive plan over the next three years. But

04:53.299 --> 05:00.390
we had some budget, severe budget cuts this past 
year. I think we lost $150,000 out of our budget,

05:00.430 --> 05:08.762
resulting in losing three positions. So that sort 
of put us off of our three-year timetable of

05:09.856 --> 05:17.483
getting something out. And what even makes it look 
a little worse in terms of if we're going to get a

05:17.744 --> 05:32.438
comprehensive plan out is this upcoming tax 
referendum, which might totally not abolish the

05:17.744 --> 05:32.438
planning department, but severely cut it.

05:36.702 --> 05:38.884
I haven't directly answered that. that question 
but we really don't do any comprehensive planning

05:39.235 --> 05:52.728
at this time but we do, that's one of our objectives 
is to eventually get into a comprehensive

05:39.235 --> 05:52.728
planning process. But right now it's not feasible 
from a political standpoint

05:53.849 --> 06:05.800
and from a budgetary standpoint it's probably not 
feasible because We have too many little

06:06.370 --> 06:14.879
short-range projects that we're given, which 
really doesn't allow us to have a long-range

06:06.370 --> 06:14.879
viewpoint that we're trying.

06:18.883 --> 06:20.725
I'll reword this question a bit. What 
administrative procedures and planning program

06:21.165 --> 06:26.330
elements does your community have for 
implementing? We don't have a community plan,

06:27.532 --> 06:31.195
just planning. Which one? Seven. Seven?

06:35.345 --> 06:45.440
Program elements are

06:35.345 --> 06:45.440
the departments organized, I think, in six or 
seven divisions, and each one is considered a

06:35.345 --> 06:45.440
program. My division is land use and public 
facilities.

06:52.150 --> 07:04.828
In this program, we usually try to handle all the 
land use issues that are broad in nature, affect an

06:52.150 --> 07:04.828
area of the community like North Dallas,

07:05.872 --> 07:08.155
an area larger than what's considered a 
neighborhood. Then we have another program area,

07:10.198 --> 07:16.125
neighborhood and community development. That 
handles the department's involvement in CD

07:17.647 --> 07:27.960
monies, which basically spin on doing 
neighborhood studies. Then we have urban design

07:30.023 --> 07:35.710
and the environment section, which is Tom 
Niederhauer's section. And that handles all the

07:36.517 --> 07:43.044
historical designation

07:36.517 --> 07:43.044
processing.

07:46.588 --> 07:50.632
It staffs some environmental committee. I'm not 
familiar with what it is, the actual title. It

07:55.718 --> 07:58.140
staffs the sign board. Well, I think that's been 
shifted. The sign board has been shifted to Zoning

08:04.073 --> 08:05.735
and Development Administration. That's another 
program aspect. The Zoning and Development

08:09.839 --> 08:24.453
Administration is basically our processing 
division, where it processes zoning cases,

08:09.839 --> 08:24.453
subdivision cases, Board of Adjustment cases, 
floodplain fill applications,

08:09.839 --> 08:24.453
signed Board of Adjustment.

08:28.417 --> 08:31.920
Then we have an Economic Analysis Division. which 
basically handles our computer work, where we're

08:32.558 --> 08:59.680
putting together a database, looking at how, or 
utilizing the database we have in the city, like

08:32.558 --> 08:59.680
looking at the tax file, seeing how we can utilize 
that, the building permit file, getting it in a

08:32.558 --> 08:59.680
format that we can use, taking other departments' 
information and trying to build up a database that

08:32.558 --> 08:59.680
we can use. easily so we can punch in some 
information and get it out in a form that we can use.

09:12.371 --> 09:22.663
So in terms of program elements, it sort of matches 
up with our divisional organization.

09:27.655 --> 09:31.260
Have I answered your question or am I beating 
around the bush? Yeah, I think so. What

09:34.825 --> 09:47.161
organizational structure do you have in its 
relationship with the, you mentioned it just then

09:34.825 --> 09:47.161
about the different program elements, but the 
relationship with the city council or other

09:34.825 --> 09:47.161
legislative body? And how is the relationship 
with the city council? Okay, we have no direct

09:50.386 --> 09:53.730
relationship with the city council. It's in the 
city charter that staff cannot directly

09:54.132 --> 09:59.601
communicate with the city council. The only 
communication directly with the city council

10:00.363 --> 10:04.770
that's allowed is through the city manager.

10:08.156 --> 10:14.807
We are allowed

10:08.156 --> 10:14.807
direct communication with the city planning 
commission. But usually that communication is

10:15.985 --> 10:23.775
usually transferred through a program manager or 
an assistant director or the director. It's

10:23.895 --> 10:25.958
usually not a staff individual. The only cases 
where the individual staff that has the most

10:27.059 --> 10:37.472
communication in our department with the 
planning commission are the zoning planners. And

10:37.933 --> 10:45.182
they

10:37.933 --> 10:45.182
basically present each zoning case to the 
planning commission.

10:47.963 --> 10:53.832
And the only time other staff members have 
communication with the Planning Commission is

10:47.963 --> 10:53.832
when they work with them on subcommittees. We have 
a zoning ordinance review committee, which has

10:54.673 --> 11:00.522
one or two commission members on it. We have a new 
inner city committee looking at inner city

11:02.104 --> 11:07.392
issues. There's one or two commission members on 
that. That's the only time we really get direct

11:10.336 --> 11:13.661
contact with commission members. So it's sort of a 
formal structure, whereas We communicate with

11:18.035 --> 11:33.315
our program manager who communicates with the 
assistant director and director, and the

11:18.035 --> 11:33.315
assistant director and directors have basic 
communication with the planning commission and

11:18.035 --> 11:33.315
the manager's office. Sort of a hierarchy.

11:39.112 --> 11:46.744
Whereas there is communication every once in a 
while in between individual staff members and the

11:39.112 --> 11:46.744
planning commission, but it's not very often. 
Like I just recently gave a presentation to the

11:47.245 --> 11:56.199
planning commission, and one of them asked if I was 
new, because they never saw me. They only see about

11:56.379 --> 12:01.988
10 different people regularly in the department, 
and some of them assume that's basically it.

12:02.428 --> 12:05.473
That's the whole department, those people they 
see once a week. Because I've been here a year and a

12:05.977 --> 12:08.981
half, and this lady said, oh, are you new? Where 
have you been? So in

12:09.742 --> 12:22.219
terms of organizations, pretty formal in terms of 
who has direct contact with the people higher up.

12:23.301 --> 12:25.123
Because the city is rather large. Our 
department's rather large. And you can't have

12:26.465 --> 12:33.174
every member in the department having contact 
with every member of the planning commission. It

12:33.254 --> 12:35.477
would create chaos. And that'd be mixed stories. 
One staff member would have an opinion, and he'd

12:39.562 --> 12:48.532
express that opinion to a commission member, and 
the commission member would take that as the

12:39.562 --> 12:48.532
department's position when it's not. So that 
would lead to problems if you didn't have that

12:50.014 --> 13:02.427
formal line of communication, whereas 
communication usually comes through very few

12:50.014 --> 13:02.427
people to the higher level. What's the present 
city council's reaction to planning, if you know

13:03.318 --> 13:09.347
what I mean? I've read many a North Dallas issue.

13:18.640 --> 13:21.545
Overall, I don't think they're very responsive. 
There's a few members that seem to be, like Sid

13:21.585 --> 13:32.160
Stahl seems to want planning, wants a 
comprehensive plan. I think the council's sort of

13:33.507 --> 13:36.090
divided now.

13:40.834 --> 13:43.517
They have divided interest. I think we're in a 
transition from a developer or

13:43.537 --> 13:51.044
business-oriented council to a people-oriented 
council. Or maybe not a people-oriented council,

13:52.926 --> 14:01.675
but a district-oriented council, because we just 
recently changed over to single-member

13:52.926 --> 14:01.675
districts. whereas most of the council members 
are looking out after their constituency, which

14:02.448 --> 14:18.627
is sometimes a minority constituency, like 
Medrano's constituency is probably mostly

14:02.448 --> 14:18.627
ethnics. I can't state that as facts, but I think 
it's sort of dividing the city up into areas and

14:21.009 --> 14:31.982
creating a lot of little squabbles that wouldn't 
have occurred if all the council members were at

14:21.009 --> 14:31.982
large. It is changing the structure of the council 
and its relationship to the business community,

14:33.025 --> 14:50.747
but still the council is very strongly associated 
with the business community because Paulson's a

14:33.025 --> 14:50.747
big developer in town and he's the mayor. It's sort 
of a traditional pattern that the council would be

14:52.789 --> 15:01.480
business-oriented or development-oriented. 
pro-development oriented. It's not to say

15:03.637 --> 15:13.471
development's bad, it's just it's probably bad 
when the decision makers are all biased when

15:03.637 --> 15:13.471
they're making a decision.

15:17.697 --> 15:24.106
So it's really hard to tell

15:17.697 --> 15:24.106
the direction they're going to take in terms of 
planning. There are too many unknowns that

15:26.369 --> 15:30.555
elections coming up, Folsom isn't running for 
re-election. If we get a strong mayor in there

15:31.379 --> 15:40.454
that's people-oriented, it'll probably change 
the outlook tremendously.

15:40.474 --> 15:43.099
Then again, we don't know what's going to happen in 
the tax referendum. If that passes, even if we do

15:43.139 --> 15:52.294
get a council that is pro-planning, we're not 
going to be able to do any planning because we're

15:43.139 --> 15:52.294
not going to have the staff.

15:54.257 --> 15:56.020
That is, I assume we're not going to have the staff. 
So it's really hard to tell where we're going to be

15:58.598 --> 16:05.707
going until after January 17th, or 18th, whenever 
that election is. 17. 17. Why don't

16:06.508 --> 16:13.877
we skip down to the last question? You mentioned 
the history part would be hard for you to cover,

16:15.959 --> 16:21.766
which would be mostly what 11 is. And you've 
answered what the current status of planning is in

16:22.607 --> 16:25.551
the city. How about the role of outside 
consultants in planning?

16:32.930 --> 16:37.535
I really don't know how much impact outside 
consultants have. Anytime we get a controversial

16:37.575 --> 16:48.805
issue, it seems that we bring in a consultant to do a 
study instead of staff handling it. In many cases,

16:50.227 --> 16:53.850
it's not always. I really haven't had that much 
experience with consultants while I've been

16:54.100 --> 16:57.243
here. Everything I've worked on, we haven't had a 
consultant. I came in at the tail end of one

17:01.127 --> 17:04.771
consultant study and took it through. That was 
Babcock did an analysis of our zoning ordinance.

17:12.618 --> 17:17.844
And one aspect of that was analysis of our parking 
standards in the zoning ordinance. And as a result

17:17.864 --> 17:22.268
of that, one of my functions when I first got here 
was to staffed the zoning advisory committee and

17:22.990 --> 17:36.730
put together some recommendations based on 
Babcock's parking study or parking analysis.

17:36.750 --> 17:39.754
In most cases, we disagreed with what Babcock did. 
That was the poorest part of his study.

17:44.692 --> 17:48.437
But I really don't know how involved consultants 
have been with the city. Tom Niederhammer would

17:49.178 --> 17:50.299
know. He probably already told Cornish what their 
involvement is because he's worked quite a bit

17:50.319 --> 18:01.934
with people like Kevin Lynch, who did our sign 
ordinance and worked with our sign ordinance

17:50.319 --> 18:01.934
committee. So Tom would have a better viewpoint of 
how the role of consultants have affected

18:03.717 --> 18:08.623
planning in Dallas. OK, how about on question 
number 12, these influences? You mentioned the

18:13.762 --> 18:18.167
political influence or the business 
orientation. Have you noticed any religious

18:18.187 --> 18:23.013
influences which affected planning for you? I 
really don't think there has been significant

18:23.333 --> 18:27.418
religious influences on planning.

18:31.183 --> 18:39.252
I think political is probably the biggest current 
influence on where planning will go. Geographic

18:39.923 --> 18:59.168
influence had probably been the strongest in 
determining the urban form in Dallas in terms of

18:39.923 --> 18:59.168
why Dallas came about, why Dallas occurred here, 
and why it grew. It's significant now in terms of

18:59.188 --> 19:06.117
being a regional center.

19:07.700 --> 19:14.349
It was significant back in the 1800s because this 
was the narrowest crossing of the Trinity within

19:07.700 --> 19:14.349
100 miles. That's the reason why Bryan came here in 
the first place. It's probably the reason why the

19:18.375 --> 19:21.359
railroads were enclosed to come here. Also 
because of some bribery that went on and stuff.

19:27.608 --> 19:31.414
Which all these things added up to Dallas growing. 
It has regional significance. So I think that's

19:36.455 --> 19:49.073
important in its early development and its 
current status as being a regional distribution

19:36.455 --> 19:49.073
center for goods. It's probably the reason why the 
World Trade Center out here is doing so well. The

19:56.503 --> 20:04.234
reason why it can compete with New York in terms of 
marketing fashion and stuff because of its

19:56.503 --> 20:04.234
centralized location.

20:07.403 --> 20:12.812
So the most important effect on planning is 
political.

20:15.858 --> 20:20.266
Geographic location is important as far as its 
early development.

20:24.112 --> 20:32.567
I'm not too familiar with sociological effects or 
ethnic effects.

20:33.863 --> 20:39.717
groups are a political force, so they relate to the 
political climate. But I don't know about what

20:39.737 --> 20:44.288
their effects on planning is, other than they're 
sort of skeptical.

20:47.335 --> 20:49.240
Anytime we'd go into an area, that's dominated by 
an ethnic group, they're very skeptical of what

20:50.806 --> 21:07.309
we're doing because they see us as being the big 
city and seeing us as a foe because we've done so

20:50.806 --> 21:07.309
many bad things to them in the past, putting 
freeways through the middle of their

20:50.806 --> 21:07.309
neighborhoods. They're afraid that we're going 
to go in there and tear down their whole area and

21:08.570 --> 21:13.137
they won't have any place to live. And that was one 
of the reasons why the... ICP plan, the Interim

21:19.055 --> 21:24.042
Comprehensive Plans, failed because you 
couldn't get the minority support. And the

21:24.883 --> 21:30.330
minorities were the ones to benefit from a 
planning effort.

21:33.915 --> 21:36.439
So I guess they do affect planning somewhat. If 
they're not receptive to planning, the planning

21:37.320 --> 21:44.910
probably won't occur because you need citizen 
support or the planning effort, and the citizen

21:45.633 --> 22:03.859
support relates directly to political climate, 
like if there's strong citizen support in the

21:45.633 --> 22:03.859
planning department doing something, it's more 
than likely that the politicians will be somewhat

21:45.633 --> 22:03.859
in favor of what we're doing.

22:07.925 --> 22:13.092
And that's one reason why any time we do a land use 
study, or most of the time we go out and try to put

22:13.510 --> 22:32.010
together some citizen participation, have a 
community meeting, elect a task force to work with

22:13.510 --> 22:32.010
us so we can go through the public hearing process, 
have citizens there that worked with us as

22:13.510 --> 22:32.010
evidence that we were out in the community working 
with the citizens and that we have their support.

22:32.330 --> 22:33.892
It's much easier to get things through. So I guess 
if you're working in an area that's composed of

22:33.912 --> 22:43.382
minorities, you're going to have to have their 
support more than likely. to get a plan through, if

22:44.915 --> 22:53.086
it's a neighborhood or community plan. Do you see 
any military influences anywhere? From my

22:55.730 --> 23:00.216
experiences in Fort Worth, it's pretty much now. 
Well, in the early 60s and 70s, there was a bomb in

23:00.556 --> 23:03.360
enforcement. It's dying out now. Do you see any in 
the Dallas area? I don't know if there has been or

23:07.446 --> 23:10.450
not. I'd say currently there isn't any. We do have a 
naval base out way on the... Grand Prairie. Yeah,

23:17.218 --> 23:22.123
it's in our city limits, but essentially it's 
surrounded by Grand Prairie. But I don't see that

23:23.964 --> 23:26.787
as a big influence on the city of Dallas. It's way 
out there on the edge. I don't know what kind of

23:29.209 --> 23:30.911
impact it has had. I think that's the only military 
installation in the city that I know of. How about

23:36.536 --> 23:40.740
the... What do you see as the big economic 
influence in the area? now and in the coming

23:41.935 --> 23:44.379
future? I think the one thing that has had a major 
economic influence on the city and its direction

23:44.399 --> 23:55.277
of growth is the creation of DFW.

23:59.684 --> 24:03.210
That has strengthened the growth to the 
northwest. That's the only area the city's really

24:03.230 --> 24:04.973
growing in. Look at a growth corridor. We're 
growing in between here and north out of Dallas.

24:12.724 --> 24:18.550
And if that airport wasn't built, I don't think 
you'd be seeing that kind of growth. I don't think

24:19.811 --> 24:29.901
north Dallas would have grown as it did because it 
seems to be correlated to DFW being built. But I

24:31.863 --> 24:32.944
can't say that's a fact. I'm not. that familiar 
with regional economics. That's just a general

24:37.894 --> 24:39.416
observation. Well, has the city of Dallas come up 
with, I shouldn't say a plan, but some way of attack

24:40.497 --> 24:52.031
to maybe stop some of the growth moving out of the 
city? Because Plano is on the up and all the other

24:52.151 --> 24:58.198
suburbs to the north. Yeah.

25:05.129 --> 25:12.036
We started the North Dallas study with 
cooperation from the surrounding cities in that

25:05.129 --> 25:12.036
area. I think there's seven cities that were 
involved. And one of the objectives in that study

25:15.699 --> 25:21.285
was to limit development rights. Like our zoning 
ordinance is too liberal. They can build very

25:24.668 --> 25:27.912
intense development under current zoning. In 
certain areas up there are O2 districts and MF2.

25:33.142 --> 25:35.664
districts of pretty high densities. One of the 
objectives was to have the zoning ordinance

25:36.125 --> 25:51.640
correlate to current average development, 
because development intensity increases as it

25:36.125 --> 25:51.640
starts to be building out. As land becomes more 
valuable, you have to build more units per acre,

25:51.660 --> 25:58.827
more square footage of office or retail per acre. 
So they wanted to try to put a ceiling on that. and

26:03.078 --> 26:11.810
put a ceiling on it just above the current average 
development and not the current allowable

26:03.078 --> 26:11.810
development. However, the other cities didn't 
want to cooperate with doing that. So that fell

26:17.418 --> 26:18.259
through. That was one objective of the North 
Dallas study. But that never happened. And

26:27.291 --> 26:29.254
cooperation with other cities broke down. The 
problem here is it's regional in nature. You have

26:32.608 --> 26:34.410
so many jurisdictions involved. If one city 
tightened up their development standards, the

26:34.450 --> 26:41.740
development would just go to one of the other 
cities. It would encourage development to go

26:42.261 --> 26:46.767
further north instead of go elsewhere in the city. 
So the only way you can accomplish a goal of cutting

26:46.787 --> 26:56.541
back development densities is for all the cities 
in the area to cooperate. whereas they're not

26:57.753 --> 26:59.615
really cooperating. Each one wants to get as much 
development and thereby get as much revenues as

26:59.735 --> 27:07.824
possible from what's happening up there. They 
want all their fair share or more than their fair

27:08.565 --> 27:11.589
share. So everybody's in competition, 
essentially, with the other. They're just not

27:16.434 --> 27:18.656
going to do anything to stop the growth. They're 
going to try to encourage it. And the result is

27:21.219 --> 27:27.186
massive transportation problems.

27:29.326 --> 27:35.215
And that was another objective of the North Dallas 
study to solve some of the transportation

27:29.326 --> 27:35.215
problems up there.

27:38.200 --> 27:48.176
But you can't solve transportation problems in 
this little portion of Dallas when you have

27:38.200 --> 27:48.176
impacts coming from three sides that you don't 
have control over. So all the planning department

27:50.660 --> 27:54.827
can essentially do is analyze the problem, 
project traffic volumes, and determine how much

27:54.993 --> 28:01.821
money is needed to meet that future demand. And it 
ends up that it's in the hundreds of millions of

28:03.143 --> 28:07.889
dollars in that one 30 square mile area. I'm not 
real familiar on the facts and figures of North

28:10.292 --> 28:13.796
Dallas because I didn't work on it. But in terms of 
planning, our role is Basically, we analyze the

28:19.968 --> 28:22.171
situation. We tell the decision makers what are 
the implications of what's happening and what we

28:22.231 --> 28:27.419
expect to happen.

28:30.363 --> 28:34.609
And not in terms, or at least we haven't yet 
formulated a plan for the area. We do have various

28:34.669 --> 28:37.033
land use concepts formulated. And under each 
scenario, we have the impacts of each scenario in

28:37.494 --> 28:48.810
terms of traffic volumes, in terms of dollars, and 
transportation improvements. But it's really up

28:49.853 --> 28:59.583
in the hands of the decision makers whether or not 
and when in RF we're going to ever put those kind of

28:49.853 --> 28:59.583
improvements up there. We know we're going to need 
them to solve the congestion problems. But the

29:03.187 --> 29:12.496
other side of the coin is that people can live with 
congestion or that when it becomes so congested,

29:03.187 --> 29:12.496
the development will go elsewhere, will go 
further north.

29:15.539 --> 29:18.983
There's no easy way to put a cap on that growth. And 
we can't divert it to other areas of Dallas. We

29:24.679 --> 29:28.403
could have 20 years ago if we had stronger 
planning.

29:31.387 --> 29:32.107
But we didn't. I think a lot of that growth could 
have gone elsewhere. But it got started up there.

29:41.698 --> 29:46.523
Like three years ago, no one expected that kind of 
thing to happen that quickly.

29:50.722 --> 29:54.486
As far as planning is concerned, we really can't 
control it or direct it. We can just monitor it.

29:58.231 --> 29:59.332
Stay one step behind it. Monitor it and analyze 
implications from what's happening currently,

29:59.352 --> 30:12.387
gear our bond programs to address those problems. 
But there's going to come a point where other

30:13.528 --> 30:19.615
citizens in Dallas are going to probably vote such 
bond programs down because we're sinking all this

30:20.101 --> 30:41.400
money up in that one area and they're going to feel 
like they're being ignored or politically at some

30:20.101 --> 30:41.400
point there's not going to be the money put up there 
that's necessary for those improvements in my

30:20.101 --> 30:41.400
opinion so you're going to probably have a very 
long term problem up there

30:45.852 --> 31:00.494
It could be that areas up there, if congestion gets 
too bad and there's no money to solve the problem,

30:45.852 --> 31:00.494
certain businesses due to congestion might fail 
and might move further north or someplace else.

31:01.516 --> 31:05.802
There's a potential problem up there, all kinds of 
problems to solve.

31:15.080 --> 31:19.251
