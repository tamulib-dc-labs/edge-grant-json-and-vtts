00:02.933 --> 00:19.518
We've been talking about the various buildings 
and one thing I wanted to ask you in particular to

00:02.933 --> 00:19.518
have it on record is I've been told a couple of times 
who the girl was that was used for a model for the

00:02.933 --> 00:19.518
heads on the systems building. This was Sarah, 
Sarah Orth. Sarah Orth was the daughter of Bill

00:25.587 --> 00:29.312
Orth. who came to the college about 1928 or 1929 
principally to head the buildings and grounds

00:30.406 --> 00:49.928
department at the time, when at the time the 
college had decided they would erect the library

00:30.406 --> 00:49.928
themselves and the first wing on the chemistry 
building. She was his daughter, grew up here a

00:52.050 --> 00:59.198
number of years on the campus, a very attractive 
young lady.

01:00.241 --> 01:13.117
Sam Vosper used her as a model for some of the 
figures decorating the system administration

01:00.241 --> 01:13.117
building entrance and main lobby. So the 
procedure for making these, whether they were

01:13.137 --> 01:26.013
faces or animal heads, was to was to carve one and 
then make a mold from that and then cast? You had to

01:26.534 --> 01:29.337
make a plaster mold and some something to set up 
your molds for making your castings from. And then

01:34.967 --> 01:37.710
thereafter, you cast however many you needed. And 
that all was done on campus, too. That's right.

01:43.958 --> 01:51.588
You mentioned that the college decided to build 
some of these new buildings on its own. In other

01:51.708 --> 01:57.535
words, it was its own contractor, and it hired the 
laborers to do all the work. under whose direction

01:58.409 --> 01:59.911
then? Well, as I said, this W.A. Orth, a graduate of 
A&M, I don't remember where he was working when he

02:04.859 --> 02:21.784
came here, but

02:04.859 --> 02:21.784
he was brought here to head the department and the 
buildings and college utilities department

02:04.859 --> 02:21.784
actually constructed these buildings, along 
with another project like extension of utility

02:22.355 --> 02:29.767
tunnels and things of that sort. But I think of 
those two buildings particularly that were built

02:29.787 --> 02:34.836
in that time. I'm not certain about Hart Hall. I 
can't remember when that was contracted. I'd

02:39.384 --> 02:42.569
rather think the college built it, too. I should 
know. I designed the heating system for it at the

02:44.352 --> 02:46.776
time. That was one of the other things I wanted to 
ask you. How much of the designing did you

02:49.835 --> 02:53.399
personally do on some of the buildings? Well, 
principally my work, quite often there was an

02:54.841 --> 03:07.176
intermingling of my work with the engineering 
experiment station, the college architect,

02:54.841 --> 03:07.176
because the offices were in the same building, the 
head man was the same. Generally, I designed some

03:08.197 --> 03:14.265
of the mechanical equipment, in particular hot 
water heating systems. I remember particularly

03:17.272 --> 03:33.426
Hart Hall, the dormitory, and Walton Hall, and the 
Cushing Library, the original heating system and

03:17.272 --> 03:33.426
that. And then of course later when we cut over or 
changed over the heating of the entire campus,

03:33.446 --> 03:44.455
which was a combination of steam heating and hot 
water heating, and established a central hot

03:45.515 --> 03:54.065
water heating system and converted all buildings 
that had been steamed to hot water heating. Well,

03:54.085 --> 04:01.995
that was one of my jobs of making the designs for the 
changeover and the buildings. That would have

04:02.435 --> 04:05.799
been after you came back from the war though? No, 
that was in the 30s. So you did have a excuse me,

04:14.202 --> 04:17.326
central heating system before the war. Yes, but it 
didn't include all buildings. A number of the

04:23.393 --> 04:39.653
buildings had a hot water heating system, but they 
had a heat exchanger in the building which

04:23.393 --> 04:39.653
converted steam to hot water or heated the water 
with steam that was then circulated by gravity

04:23.393 --> 04:39.653
through the building. At that time, we went to 
forced circulation from a central plant. Did you

04:46.372 --> 04:50.737
make use of any students in any of these building 
projects? There were always students used for

04:50.757 --> 04:58.826
drafting and other purposes all the time. Now, of 
course, primarily in the Big 33 expansion, this

04:58.886 --> 05:08.577
was Depression days, and architects and 
engineers were quite readily obtainable at that

05:09.839 --> 05:33.630
time because there wasn't much construction 
going on, and we had a full staff of largely adult

05:09.839 --> 05:33.630
engineers and architects, although they always 
had a number of students that did various things,

05:09.839 --> 05:33.630
particularly drafting, that is putting the thing 
on the tracing cloth that had been designed by

05:09.839 --> 05:33.630
someone else. I was particularly asking or 
interested in whether you used students in in any

05:39.488 --> 05:44.915
of the actual construction, any of the laborers 
for digging foundations? Particularly in

05:46.317 --> 05:49.761
summer, quite often they were used in that. It was 
difficult to use students in many construction

05:50.682 --> 05:59.493
jobs because most of the time they didn't have 
hours that fitted in very well with construction

05:50.682 --> 05:59.493
time. I used quite a number in the buildings and 
college utilities. A very large portion of the

06:09.323 --> 06:17.637
janitorial service or custodial service in those 
days was students. This is pre-World War II. Yeah.

06:22.626 --> 06:29.357
Were any of the buildings constructed as WPA 
projects?

06:32.155 --> 06:43.331
I don't believe we had any buildings conducted, 
but we had other construction projects on the

06:32.155 --> 06:43.331
campus, sidewalks, curbs and gutters. At the time 
I left, I had a crew out at what was to be Easterwood

06:44.533 --> 07:02.078
Airport, a construction crew clearing off the 
pasture area there so that it could be graded and

06:44.533 --> 07:02.078
built.

07:04.015 --> 07:11.365
We made a lot of drainage pipe, concrete pipe, 
actually set up a plant and made it with WPA labor.

07:12.106 --> 07:22.520
We made a lot of half rounds to use in lining some of 
the drainage ditches, particularly what is now

07:12.106 --> 07:22.520
the golf course. A number of those creeks were 
partially lined with half round pipes and small

07:32.973 --> 07:34.034
concrete slabs.

07:36.978 --> 07:39.360
Was that to prevent additional erosion? Well, it 
had to clear up so the stuff would drain out and you

07:40.282 --> 07:50.113
wouldn't get holes that raised mosquitoes in and 
things, and that's how you improved the drainage.

07:51.615 --> 08:01.146
Now, I believe a little bit earlier you indicated 
that in, what, late 1940 you entered the military

07:51.615 --> 08:01.146
service. Yes. In what capacity did you enter the 
service? At that time I was

08:09.075 --> 08:14.081
in the infantry. Olin Teague and I went on duty 
together on October the 2nd, 1940 at Fort Sam for

08:16.303 --> 08:26.616
physical exams. He wound up with the military 
police company down at Camp Palacios. And I was an

08:32.710 --> 08:42.358
infantry instructor in the Houston Military 
District, stationed in Houston initially.

08:44.941 --> 08:49.425
At that time, I was a first lieutenant.

08:53.028 --> 08:56.711
I take it you had remained in military. I was 
commissioned a second lieutenant in 1929 on May

08:57.532 --> 09:02.616
26, And then you remained in what was then the 
National Guard? No, I retained my reserve

09:06.345 --> 09:08.969
commission. In fact, the first summer I went on 
active duty after graduation, I was in the 359th

09:09.369 --> 09:19.404
Infantry, which was headquartered in Dallas. And 
I had been assigned to them because my home address

09:20.605 --> 09:25.312
was Denison, Texas, up north of Dallas. At the same 
time, I got to camp another regiment was there, the

09:31.925 --> 09:39.453
360th, which was composed of Houston and College 
Station, the southern part of the state area. And

09:39.533 --> 09:46.260
Colonel Ike Ashburn was the colonel commanding 
the unit. And Colonel Ashburn at that time was

09:46.320 --> 09:55.250
secretary of the Former Students Association, 
and then later became assistant to the president.

09:56.191 --> 09:58.573
And he was then succeeded by E. McQuillan.

10:02.587 --> 10:19.408
I

10:02.587 --> 10:19.408
stayed there in Houston until, I don't know long, 
about May 1941,

10:02.587 --> 10:19.408
just to show you how you might, how assignments 
might happen. Back in 34 and 5, I had commanded a

10:20.309 --> 10:30.282
camp of two Civilian Conservation Corps 
companies in Santa Fe, New Mexico. And I had a

10:31.544 --> 10:38.032
lieutenant under my command there named Harold 
Penny from Arizona. And I was adjutant in the

10:38.052 --> 10:43.680
Houston Military District and infantry 
instructor there. One day I was reading the Army

10:43.720 --> 11:01.483
and Navy Journal and happened to see a story on the 
front page about the adjutant general school

10:43.720 --> 11:01.483
being set up in Washington, D.C. And on the staff 
and factory, they listed this Jack Penny. I had not

11:02.510 --> 11:08.878
heard of him since then so I dropped him a note 
telling him what I was doing and I was adjutant

11:02.510 --> 11:08.878
there and this and that. About a week later I had a 
call from San Antonio Military District that was

11:10.240 --> 11:23.318
in charge of all the reserve activities in the 8th 
service, 8th corps area it was then.

11:26.362 --> 11:30.407
They told me they had a request for my being 
transferred to the adjutant general school And

11:30.860 --> 11:35.525
Colonel Jones at the time said, well, Badger, you 
don't have to go if you don't want to. We won't

11:35.565 --> 11:36.526
release you. I said, well, that sounds kind of 
interesting to me. I think I'll try it. So I was

11:41.091 --> 11:47.478
immediately transferred to the Adjutant General 
School, the staff and faculty there. I was

11:49.641 --> 11:53.785
assistant editor of the Adjutant General's 
publications at that time. Of course, we had gone

11:55.948 --> 11:57.930
on active duty Both Tig and I for six months for 
training, but we hadn't been on more than a month or

11:58.619 --> 12:08.313
so until they extended to a year, and you were 
supposed to rotate after a year. So after 13

12:08.393 --> 12:14.862
months, I might as well return to College Station. 
I'd been on military leave. This was before war,

12:19.428 --> 12:26.398
before Pearl Harbor, but it was just about time to 
meet myself going back. Although when I returned

12:28.555 --> 12:55.542
to college, Mr. Gilchrist, who was then dean of 
engineering, and Mr. Spence, who was then acting

12:28.555 --> 12:55.542
vice director of the engineering experiment 
station, assigned me to Austin to represent the

12:28.555 --> 12:55.542
university on the governor's originally 
industrial staff, which about that time became

12:28.555 --> 12:55.542
defense staff, by the time I got there.

13:01.428 --> 13:05.893
And then, so how long did you stay in Austin then?

13:08.756 --> 13:14.823
Well, immediately after Pearl Harbor, I had 
orders to return to active duty to the infantry

13:08.756 --> 13:14.823
school in Fort Benning, Georgia. And I was working 
with the Secretary of State quite a bit in Austin.

13:22.791 --> 13:30.540
Bill,

13:22.791 --> 13:30.540
I don't know the name of that graduate, by the way. 
Anyhow, I told Bill to tell the governor that I was

13:31.111 --> 13:38.279
going back to an active duty. I was a captain at the 
time. And next week would be my last over there. The

13:45.667 --> 13:48.571
following week, I came back to close up my office. 
And the Secretary of State told me, he said,

13:50.153 --> 13:58.502
Howard, I hope you don't mind it, but Governor 
Stevenson and I called General Donovan. I told

14:00.102 --> 14:03.927
them we just couldn't let you go right now, and he's 
deferred you for six months. I told them, well, I

14:05.449 --> 14:09.695
wouldn't have done it, but since they've done it, 
I'll naturally stay. So I stayed there until June

14:09.715 --> 14:30.042
the 1st of 1942,

14:09.715 --> 14:30.042
that would be, which time I went on duty to tank the 
Story Camp Command as Assistant G-1 on General

14:09.715 --> 14:30.042
A.D. Bruce's staff at that time. Where were you 
stationed at? At Camp Hood. Camp Hood, uh-huh.

14:38.897 --> 14:45.026
General Bruce always had a dream then of making 
Camp Hood a permanent post. So when it was set up,

14:45.407 --> 14:50.595
you had a number of buildings on the

14:55.233 --> 15:00.698
camp painted post headquarters, post this and 
post that. Well, of course, the only one that's

15:00.718 --> 15:03.420
legal was post engineer. The rest of them are 
temporary insulation as a camp and not entitled to

15:04.221 --> 15:10.846
be called a post. And it stayed that way until an 
inspector general from Washington came through

15:10.866 --> 15:15.550
and happened to see them. And they were 
immediately repainted with the designation camp

15:15.570 --> 15:23.216
instead of post headquarters. I was the first 
adjutant. of Camp Hood and when it was established

15:26.080 --> 15:34.931
and moved out from Temple there when we first 
opened it. How long did you stay at Camp Hood or Fort

15:34.951 --> 15:38.796
Hood as it's known?

15:44.243 --> 15:55.497
Let's see, I got there really finally I think about 
July the first of 42

15:44.243 --> 15:55.497
and

15:44.243 --> 15:55.497
I I don't remember now whether it was a year or two. I 
stayed there until I went to the commanding

16:00.144 --> 16:06.130
general staff school at Fort Leavenworth.

16:09.072 --> 16:16.319
And right now I can't remember whether it was the 
spring of 42

16:09.072 --> 16:16.319
or 43. After completion of the course there, I was 
assigned to the 8th Service Command

16:16.859 --> 16:27.289
headquarters, which is in Dallas then. first 
Director of the Enlisted Section of the Military

16:28.180 --> 16:42.174
Personnel Division and later as Director of the 
Military Personnel Division 8th Service

16:28.180 --> 16:42.174
Command.

16:42.194 --> 16:48.801
Did you stay there then until the end of the war or 
did you have another service somewhere else? No, I

16:48.821 --> 16:52.364
wound up at two other installations. During the 
time I was at the Service Command Headquarters,

16:59.399 --> 17:15.259
The technical services installations were 
transferred from the chief of the service, like

16:59.399 --> 17:15.259
the chief surgeon or the chief engineer, to the 
service commander. Two of those posts were Camp

17:16.401 --> 17:23.950
Claiborne down in Louisiana between Lake Charles 
and Alexandria. It was an engineering camp,

17:25.452 --> 17:28.596
training center. and the medical training center 
out at Barclay.

17:37.208 --> 17:58.397
These commanding officers couldn't remember 
that they were no longer on the chiefs of services

17:37.208 --> 17:58.397
and were under the service command, commanding 
general instead, and this led to quite a number of

17:37.208 --> 17:58.397
problems, and both of them had gotten a pretty bad 
reputation in the military services anyhow. So

17:59.491 --> 18:11.290
the general set up an investigating board to go to 
Camp Claiborne and find out what was wrong with it.

18:11.310 --> 18:19.082
And it was my job with some assistance to dig into 
the personnel set up at Camp Claiborne. And I

18:19.302 --> 18:27.355
admit, while we were there, every time we got 
anything from the service command headquarters,

18:19.302 --> 18:27.355
we were scared to death we were going to be 
transferred there. But we got out safely and

18:28.482 --> 18:32.868
returned to Dallas. And a few weeks later, we were 
sent out to Camp Barkley at Abilene to do the same

18:34.771 --> 18:39.238
thing there. And some months later after return, I 
was sent out to Camp Barkley to be director of

18:41.621 --> 18:56.022
personnel for the camp and begin to close out the 
installation. This was in the

19:00.663 --> 19:02.906
long about the time of the Battle of the Bulge. And 
then from there I went to

19:05.129 --> 19:15.083
camp up at Gainesville, Camp Howes. As director of 
personnel, I wasn't there very long. The

19:20.049 --> 19:28.321
commanding officer and I went to service command 
headquarters a time or so, and each time he came

19:20.049 --> 19:28.321
back and said, Badgett, you better thank me. I 
can't be out of Claiborne this time. And one day, he

19:31.122 --> 19:34.146
came in after a review. He was very fond of having 
reviews on Saturday morning, which I was not great

19:34.166 --> 19:41.918
at hearing of. He came in and called me in the 
office, stuck out his hand, said, well, goodbye,

19:44.662 --> 19:48.407
Batch. And I said, Carl, who's going, you or me? He 
says, you're going to Captain Claiborne. So I went

19:53.575 --> 19:58.682
down there to try to straighten out the personnel 
situation and that mess. But I enjoyed both

19:59.219 --> 20:04.546
assignments very much.

20:04.566 --> 20:08.751
At what point then did you leave active duty?

20:13.378 --> 20:19.886
I left Claiborne,

20:13.378 --> 20:19.886
I believe I went off active duty in February 1946. 
Did you return immediately to the A&M then? Yes. In

20:26.995 --> 20:49.930
fact, knowing I was going to get out soon, I had come 
over here one weekend to see Mr. Spence, with whom

20:26.995 --> 20:49.930
I'd worked with before in the Experiment Station, 
and he had been assigned a job as head in the

20:26.995 --> 20:49.930
Construction Program Office for the college at 
the time, and of course I was on military leave at

20:26.995 --> 20:49.930
the time. I didn't know whether I'd have a job when I 
got back or not, but But to see him he said, Howard

20:53.708 --> 20:59.275
says, I've just got so much to do that I'm making 
enemies out of my friends. I'm getting so nasty

20:59.335 --> 21:00.657
with them. I need some help and I'd pay you a lot more 
money to work here and I can't never an experiment

21:01.718 --> 21:06.384
station. So at that time when I returned I went into 
physical plant work at the university or college

21:06.444 --> 21:13.554
at that time. Did you go in immediately as 
assistant manager of? Assistant manager of

21:17.639 --> 21:19.261
construction. Assistant manager of 
construction.

21:23.982 --> 21:26.605
What, then, were your responsibilities in that 
position? Well, at that time, I guess our most

21:27.085 --> 21:51.188
pressing job at that time was converting Hart and 
Walton Halls for family occupancy, making suites

21:27.085 --> 21:51.188
of rooms out of them for married veterans who were 
returning to A&M, as well as completing the

21:27.085 --> 21:51.188
construction on what a conversion of the project 
houses. I started to say construction, but they

21:53.990 --> 21:57.113
were built during the Depression. And they were 
converted to married student housing for

21:58.215 --> 22:03.621
graduate students at the time. Oh, I took over a lot 
of these jobs, and the planning, and the handling,

22:04.783 --> 22:13.854
and various construction projects on the campus. 
And then along in that time, we

22:19.889 --> 22:27.178
Buildings and Grounds, or Buildings and 
Utilities it was called at that time, was under Mr.

22:19.889 --> 22:27.178
Spence's nominal direction too. I took

22:27.198 --> 22:49.086
over the administration of the

22:27.198 --> 22:49.086
operating end of the

22:27.198 --> 22:49.086
buildings and utilities and set up the physical 
plant department.

22:51.530 --> 23:06.630
landscape or building of the grounds department 
which had been acting or operating under the head

22:51.530 --> 23:06.630
of the floor culture and landscape department and 
reorganized the thing. Of course that time Knox

23:08.232 --> 23:12.758
Walker was my superintendent of buildings and 
utilities. I was unaware of the fact that Hart and

23:14.660 --> 23:19.967
Walton had ever been converted to married student 
housing. Well, they left themselves very well to

23:21.438 --> 23:28.466
it because it's a suite type of dormitory. You have 
two rooms with a connecting bath, laboratory,

23:28.526 --> 23:35.874
laboratory in each room. What we did, we took one 
room was the sleeping quarters and the other room

23:36.855 --> 23:44.623
was the kitchen 9-ed. We bought some kitchen 
cabinets and installed them in there. and stoves.

23:52.613 --> 23:54.055
We piped it with gas. So each married couple had two 
rooms in which one you could say was the living room

23:55.337 --> 24:05.411
bedroom and the other was the dining room kitchen. 
For how long were these two buildings used that

24:05.431 --> 24:08.115
way? Two or three years. Of course we You had a 
decline in students during the war, and then this

24:12.344 --> 24:23.903
surge of returning veterans, of which many, many 
of them were married. A&M had no married student

24:24.243 --> 24:28.530
housing of any sort at that time. So those were very 
readily bought beds. I believe we used the regular

24:33.607 --> 24:35.890
dormitory beds. Bought a dresser, dinette table, 
chairs, and a few other odds and ends, and put in

24:36.311 --> 24:46.886
kitchen stoves, refrigerators, and the kitchen 
cabinet was seen. At what point were the barrack

24:48.608 --> 24:55.598
type college view buildings either brought in or 
constructed? Well, I had charge of that.

25:01.985 --> 25:24.387
These were,

25:01.985 --> 25:24.387
I guess in 47 it was started, not terribly long 
after the war, and we procured these what had been

25:01.985 --> 25:24.387
barracks

25:01.985 --> 25:24.387
down at Victoria, Texas at Foster Field, and of 
course the government handled the contracting of

25:25.177 --> 25:31.046
it, actual construction, and our own engineering 
superintendent on the job. We had to provide the

25:31.106 --> 25:36.814
utilities, walks and streets for it, and the basic 
plan for it. And these were dismantled in sections

25:38.777 --> 25:53.378
and brought up here in pieces and reassembled and 
converted from barracks to four or eight

25:38.777 --> 25:53.378
apartments each, two on each floor. Now they've 
been very serviceable. The students have

25:55.970 --> 26:00.735
generally been very happy with what they had for 
the money they had. In fact, there were some

26:00.755 --> 26:08.424
protests when this group was torn down for those 
first new permanent, not Hensel. Hensel, it was

26:08.444 --> 26:18.235
built back of the idea that ultimately the front 
part, the old barracks apartments would be this

26:08.444 --> 26:18.235
amount of torn down and new apartment houses built 
there. And so were the brick ones. And so were the

26:22.786 --> 26:24.949
first brick ones. And then we did demolish several 
on this end. I've forgotten how many, four or five

26:32.179 --> 26:35.264
of them. And built some permanent apartment 
there. That's the ones that have just been

26:39.310 --> 26:41.513
completed? No, these were built several years 
ago. They were air conditioned. And then these

26:47.290 --> 26:50.054
were built.

26:52.097 --> 26:53.600
I didn't tear down any for those. I just got rid of 
the rest of it. I see they're built on down on what

26:55.563 --> 27:02.554
had been the, what Prince Hensel had started as an 
arboretum. And they're part of the landscape

27:02.574 --> 27:05.839
architecture. That's the ones right on College 
Avenue. Well, I won't say it unless you turn that

27:08.563 --> 27:12.389
off. They may be very nice inside now, and I'm sure 
they are. Did your responsibilities as assistant

27:16.349 --> 27:28.608
manager for construction of physical plants 
carry any responsibilities

27:16.349 --> 27:28.608
for the annex?

27:32.454 --> 27:42.390
Well, before they required the annex,

27:32.454 --> 27:42.390
actually I believe Mr. Spence and I divided 
responsibilities. He would handle the new

27:43.079 --> 27:49.847
construction, I'd handle the renovation and the 
maintenance and operation of the physical plant.

27:49.867 --> 28:01.380
And

27:49.867 --> 28:01.380
jointly we, I say we acquired, we did the footwork 
of acquiring the annex. I remember I had in

28:01.961 --> 28:12.073
inventory every piece of what they call personal 
property out there when we took it over and when we

28:01.961 --> 28:12.073
turned it back the first time. See, we had it twice. 
First time they took it over,

28:15.499 --> 28:29.518
and then

28:15.499 --> 28:29.518
they closed the base down completely. Well, we had 
it probably in about 47. We got it in about 47, I

28:33.143 --> 28:34.866
think. We took it over and we had set up freshmen, 
moved freshman class out there. And they lived in

28:40.268 --> 28:43.812
one school out there. The basic, what was called 
the basic division. Basic division. It was what,

28:46.856 --> 28:48.898
about four years out there, wasn't it? Three or 
four. I don't remember how long it was. And then I

28:51.161 --> 28:54.805
guess what, during the Korean War, the Air Force 
took it back over? That would be when it took it back

28:54.845 --> 28:57.969
over and it operated again. And then we acquired 
it. Then after that, on a permanent basis, after

29:01.513 --> 29:09.162
they had removed certain buildings and we decided 
we didn't want, And we bought it, got it, went on it.

29:12.070 --> 29:17.897
We would get 5% equity in it each year we occupied 
it. In other words, in 20 years it would be 100%

29:17.917 --> 29:20.600
ours. Unless we, but some parts we actually 
bought. They set a price so we could get them on

29:23.704 --> 29:30.432
something they wouldn't have set up, they didn't 
want to change. And then later we got rid of most all

29:30.492 --> 29:34.356
the other buildings in the room. Rather, well, the 
teal theater of operation type construction, the

29:35.753 --> 29:52.934
living quarters and a lot of these wooden 
buildings were kept under the more apartment

29:35.753 --> 29:52.934
type, the later hangars and such.

29:52.954 --> 29:59.702
So, but you had some responsibility for 
converting any of those buildings after? We set up

30:00.323 --> 30:23.288
a branch of the physical plant operation office 
out there and had a superintendent who worked

30:00.323 --> 30:23.288
under the superintendent

30:00.323 --> 30:23.288
of the physical plant.

30:23.308 --> 30:29.335
And the ability to tell us I was a director, but then 
I became director of the physical plant separated

30:29.922 --> 30:37.472
completely from his dispensing room over there.

30:37.493 --> 30:38.274
Okay. After

30:38.674 --> 30:50.330
having been assistant manager, you became the 
manager of fiscal plans, at least according to the

30:38.674 --> 30:50.330
former student's directorate. Yes, I was the 
manager of fiscal plans, and then it was later

30:50.350 --> 30:57.280
changed to director of fiscal plans.

30:59.622 --> 31:05.953
Was it at that point that you separated from Mr. 
Spencer's operation?
