Testing on Monday, August 6th.

00:06.212 --> 00:07.814
Monday, August 6th.

00:07.834 --> 00:09.276
Testing, testing.

00:16.003 --> 00:17.005
Testing, two.

00:17.145 --> 00:18.126
Testing, two.

00:18.306 --> 00:19.307
Testing, two.

00:19.548 --> 00:28.498
Testing, testing, one, two, three.

00:29.099 --> 00:31.101
Testing, testing, one, two, three.

00:33.342 --> 00:46.178
This is August 6th, we're in the Evans Library and we're chatting today with Colonel Jim Woodall about his experiences here at A&M as the Commandant.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.564
You graduated from A&M now in what year?

00:50.604 --> 00:50.744
1950.

00:50.764 --> 00:54.909
1950, just in time to go to Korea, I guess.

00:55.029 --> 01:00.396
Well, just in time to go in the service for the war started about the 25th of June.

01:01.169 --> 01:03.154
However, I didn't go to Korea, I went to Germany.

01:03.355 --> 01:04.497
Oh, you went to Germany.

01:05.741 --> 01:06.763
Pretty quickly?

01:08.066 --> 01:15.465
Actually, I was called to active duty in September of 1950, and then

01:16.272 --> 01:30.868
2nd Armored Division at Fort Hood, Texas, and we trained recruits up to, you know, to combat ready status, and then the entire 2nd Armored Division deployed to Germany as part of the NATO buildup in 1951.

01:30.888 --> 01:36.855
All right, briefly summarize your active duty experience.

01:36.915 --> 01:37.816
Take us from 1950.

01:38.717 --> 01:45.064
Well, I started out as, of course, a 2nd Lieutenant platoon leader in the 41st Armored Infantry Battalion.

01:46.158 --> 02:03.024
and I stayed with them a while and then there was a critical shortage of artillery lieutenants and so I was sent to the field artillery to help train the field artillery units and then that was in late 50 and early 51.

02:03.084 --> 02:14.882
In April of 51 I was sent back to the 41st infantry battalion and then in July we deployed to Germany and stayed in Germany three years at Coleman Barracks

02:15.267 --> 02:18.216
which is near Mannheim and Heidelberg.

02:19.881 --> 02:29.850
I rotated back in 1954, and I was a company commander in the 512th Armored Infantry Battalion at Fort Hood.

02:30.877 --> 02:37.563
And then in 1955, I resigned my commission and went into the lumber business in Belton, Texas.

02:37.924 --> 02:44.950
Actually, I was working for my father-in-law in the lumber business and in the building products.

02:44.970 --> 02:49.094
We had a little manufacturing company building products and stayed there.

02:49.134 --> 02:57.002
And then I realized I'd made a mistake by getting out of the Army, but at that time, you couldn't get back in once you got out.

02:57.640 --> 03:22.129
So in 1959 a program where former regular officers could reapply for active duty came along and I reapplied and I was accepted and rejoined the Army and was called back to active duty in January 1960 in the second infantry division at Fort Benning, Georgia where I was the executive officer of a

03:22.531 --> 03:27.638
company in the 9th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Infantry Division, and we were training recruits at that time.

03:27.678 --> 03:38.093
And during that period, later on at Fort Benning, I became the commandant of the 2nd Infantry Division NCO Academy.

03:38.113 --> 03:41.538
And then I went to school there at Fort Benning.

03:41.638 --> 03:44.983
It was the career officer's course, and it was a nine-month school.

03:45.724 --> 03:51.492
At the end of the school in July of 1963,

03:51.775 --> 03:59.507
Then I went to Korea and I was stationed on the DMZ in Korea up near Panmunjom.

03:59.907 --> 04:06.758
I was the battalion adjutant S-1 for the 8th Calvary Regiment.

04:06.778 --> 04:12.346
And we were, like I said, we were stationed right on the DMZ and had a lot of things going on, a lot of action.

04:12.366 --> 04:19.757
In fact, that was my first time I was ever shot at was along the DMZ on an ambush that we pulled.

04:21.020 --> 04:37.125
I rotated back to the States in 1963 and I was assigned again to the 2nd Armored Division at Fort Hood and I was a Brigade S-1 and later on I was Division G-1.

04:37.306 --> 04:46.420
And during that time I went on Operation Big Lift to Germany where the entire division went to Germany for

04:46.653 --> 04:48.436
six weeks to two months.

04:48.816 --> 04:53.484
And another trip that we made while we were there was Operation Longhorn.

04:53.504 --> 04:58.632
No, it was Operation Desert Strike out in the Mojave Desert and spent a couple of months out in the Mojave Desert.

05:00.355 --> 05:07.686
Then I was selected for the Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth and I went to school up there for almost a year.

05:07.846 --> 05:09.589
From there I went to Washington, D.C.

05:10.143 --> 05:13.066
where I was in the strategy and tactics analysis group.

05:13.106 --> 05:19.754
And I was a military analyst at that time, stayed there two years, and then I couldn't wait to get out of Washington.

05:19.814 --> 05:22.537
In fact, I volunteered to go to Vietnam.

05:22.597 --> 05:25.901
And after two years in Washington, they did send me to Vietnam.

05:26.581 --> 05:36.252
And in Vietnam, I was assigned to the 173rd Airborne Brigade and to the 1st Battalion of the 50th Infantry, Mechanized Infantry.

05:37.109 --> 05:39.111
as the battalion executive officer.

05:39.191 --> 05:52.985
I was executive officer for five months and then for six months I was battalion commander and then my last month in Vietnam there were some problems in an airborne unit and so my command time was up.

05:53.065 --> 06:06.559
I had my six months in so they sent me over to command the airborne battalion for a short while until another lieutenant colonel came in to command the battalion and so I stayed over there a month or so and

06:06.995 --> 06:25.084
Then I came back to the States and again I was assigned to Fort Hood, Texas and I was in the combat service support test headquarters and we were testing computerizing personnel and logistics in the division.

06:26.086 --> 06:30.353
I stayed there a couple of years and then I was selected for the Army War College

06:30.991 --> 06:48.089
in 1971, graduated from the War College, and this War College was at Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania, and I graduated from the War College in 1972, and I was sent to Germany, to Heidelberg, Germany, to headquarters U.S.

06:48.149 --> 06:48.950
Army Europe.

06:50.131 --> 06:58.500
And there I was the infantry systems officer, and later on became the chief of the weapons branch in

06:58.767 --> 07:03.215
in the operations part of USRA headquarters.

07:03.255 --> 07:11.029
My last two years, I was three years in DESOPs there in Heidelberg, and then my last two years I was the deputy commander of the U.S.

07:11.109 --> 07:12.592
Army Postal Group Europe.

07:14.415 --> 07:19.003
I didn't have much to do with the postal operations.

07:20.030 --> 07:30.887
main function was to act as the IG and to get the troops shaped up because they were a pretty sorry outfit when I went in to get the troops looking and acting like soldiers.

07:31.669 --> 07:35.314
So I spent two years traveling all over Germany.

07:35.775 --> 07:45.070
We had 18 different units and scattered all over Germany and I spent two years visiting those units and getting them generally shaped up.

07:46.472 --> 07:47.674
I returned and

07:47.924 --> 07:55.955
July of 1977, came to Texas A&M, and that's where I was appointed as the commandant.

07:57.217 --> 08:06.230
And I stayed at Texas A&M as a commandant of cadets and the professor of military science until my retirement from military service in August of 1982.

08:06.250 --> 08:16.665
How did you and the commandant get, how did those two

08:16.865 --> 08:18.607
How did that role mesh for you?

08:19.247 --> 08:20.969
Did somebody communicate with you?

08:21.089 --> 08:22.170
Did you contact?

08:23.392 --> 08:25.394
Did you seek it or did they seek you?

08:25.574 --> 08:27.436
Oh, well, I sought the job, certainly.

08:28.417 --> 08:30.899
I wrote to Tiger Teague, who was the representative.

08:30.939 --> 08:33.082
I wrote to Jack Williams.

08:33.222 --> 08:42.231
I wrote to Clyde Wells, who was the chairman of the board, who was a family friend, telling them I wanted the job.

08:43.342 --> 08:47.086
But Colonel Parsons, my predecessor, kept extending.

08:47.186 --> 08:51.210
So he would extend here at A&M and I would extend over to Germany.

08:51.711 --> 08:54.774
And I ended up spending five years in Germany on a three-year tour.

08:56.076 --> 09:09.670
And I was finally notified to come back here for an interview because the person that the Pentagon sent down for that job, they had been turned down here by

09:10.612 --> 09:17.763
by the authorities at A&M, and so I came from Germany over and interviewed for the job and got it.

09:18.184 --> 09:22.691
Who, do you remember, can you describe the interview process?

09:23.773 --> 09:26.256
How many sessions were there and with whom?

09:26.276 --> 09:28.760
Well, they essentially knew who I was.

09:28.840 --> 09:34.329
I'd sent them, you know, my military record and a picture and so forth.

09:36.953 --> 09:38.155
Excuse me.

09:39.282 --> 09:46.754
And first I went to Colonel Parson, who was the commandant, and he told me, you're not going to have any trouble.

09:47.054 --> 10:00.295
And so then we went over to see General Simpson, and he was the one that the commandant reported directly to, and he was an assistant or, yeah, I think assistant or some kind of assistant vice president for student services.

10:00.395 --> 10:06.505
And then, of course, he reported to John Colas, who was the vice president of student service, and I went in to see him.

10:08.105 --> 10:30.542
And then I went to see, by this time, Dr. Williams was sick, and I went to see John Calhoun and visited with him for a little while, and then I went back over to the Trigon, and by the time I got back to Trigon, Colonel Parsons said, well, there's no problem, so you've got the job, and so I was real happy.

10:30.863 --> 10:34.669
Of course, my daughter was here from Germany, going to school, she was a freshman,

10:35.425 --> 10:41.110
So I had a chance to visit with her, but I was very glad, you know, that I'd been accepted.

10:42.271 --> 10:44.473
And so then I went back to Germany.

10:44.673 --> 10:57.705
In each of these sessions with these various individuals, which one do you remember that was really the most, like a job interview, the most?

10:58.646 --> 11:00.148
There were no job interviews.

11:00.228 --> 11:04.892
We just sat down and shot the bull, and they wanted to know who I was and what I had done.

11:05.294 --> 11:15.148
As far as you knew, were you one of many, or were you... There was one sent down from the Pentagon, and he was turned down.

11:15.248 --> 11:15.989
Okay.

11:16.009 --> 11:17.792
And then I was next on the list.

11:19.474 --> 11:20.055
All right.

11:20.075 --> 11:28.167
Of the people, and I'm not going to ask the negative, of the people who interviewed you, which one created the strongest personal impression on you, the most positive?

11:29.088 --> 11:30.390
Oh, I think General Simpsons.

11:31.130 --> 11:31.891
by far.

11:32.051 --> 11:42.202
I mean, you know, he was such a dynamic, and they were all great, you know, John Colas and Dr. Calhoun and Tom Parson, but... Had you met General Simpson before?

11:42.222 --> 11:53.894
I had never, I never even heard of General Simpson, but he was... Describe him as you... Well, he was like a great gentleman, grand gentleman, and a prince of a man.

11:53.934 --> 11:55.416
They were just

11:55.902 --> 11:57.764
Everything about him you had to like.

11:58.385 --> 11:59.527
Perfectly erect.

12:00.228 --> 12:00.768
That's right.

12:01.169 --> 12:01.890
In every way.

12:02.210 --> 12:03.212
He was a straight shooter.

12:03.632 --> 12:05.194
He told you how it was.

12:06.095 --> 12:10.842
Did anybody describe for you any problems that you would need to deal with?

12:11.683 --> 12:12.904
Well, both, oh yes.

12:13.385 --> 12:15.448
Parsons and General Simpson.

12:16.229 --> 12:17.370
What were those problems?

12:18.650 --> 12:23.202
Well, I'm not sure I remember what kind of problems they decided.

12:23.823 --> 12:31.002
But they, you know, they said, you know, you've got problems with, of course, one of the main problems was having women in the Corps.

12:31.423 --> 12:32.987
That was one of the major problems.

12:34.029 --> 12:35.072
And, you know,

12:36.689 --> 12:43.092
conduct of cadets, you know, some of the stupid tricks they pulled.

12:43.533 --> 12:49.213
But there was nothing major, but the major problem would have been women in the Corps.

12:49.565 --> 12:53.570
At the time you visited the campus, were there already women?

12:54.230 --> 12:59.296
They were introduced by the previous commandant, introduced into the Corps.

12:59.316 --> 13:00.498
During Colonel Parsons' time?

13:00.518 --> 13:05.424
About 75, I think, or something, might have been 74, I'm not sure.

13:05.544 --> 13:11.691
Did you, what was your impression, when you first chatted with him, what was your impression of Dr. Williams?

13:12.447 --> 13:15.550
Well, I didn't see Dr. Williams for some time after that.

13:15.770 --> 13:16.091
Oh, okay.

13:16.111 --> 13:16.791
You know, I saw him.

13:18.013 --> 13:19.634
Like I said, he had been sick and he came out.

13:19.654 --> 13:23.038
But I thought he was a tremendous individual, you know, dynamic.

13:24.479 --> 13:28.944
I enjoyed, you know, I enjoyed every time I ever had a chance to talk to him.

13:28.984 --> 13:32.427
Did he ever say anything to you about his World War II record?

13:32.667 --> 13:33.068
Never did.

13:34.249 --> 13:36.611
Which was a proud, proud, proud record.

13:36.892 --> 13:39.214
He was always very, very, very...

13:39.498 --> 13:42.422
shy and private about that.

13:42.863 --> 13:49.533
See, many landings in the Pacific, wounded, decorated, but he never... I never heard anything about that.

13:49.733 --> 13:52.778
He never talked about it.

13:52.798 --> 13:59.728
All right, so you came and began your services commandant at what year, what date?

14:00.830 --> 14:05.877
Well, I interviewed in April of 1977, and then I came

14:06.886 --> 14:16.541
here and I left Germany about the 8th of July and I hit the ground here on the 15th of July, which was my birthday, and started to work.

14:17.682 --> 14:17.783
Okay.

14:17.803 --> 14:20.747
Now, was Jarvis Miller over?

14:20.767 --> 14:23.211
Jarvis Miller was president by then?

14:23.231 --> 14:24.793
Was not the president at the time.

14:24.873 --> 14:24.974
Oh.

14:25.074 --> 14:27.998
He was the director of the Ag Experiment Station.

14:28.018 --> 14:29.020
Ag Experiment Station.

14:29.380 --> 14:31.864
I knew he was, he was here, but

14:32.215 --> 14:38.043
In fact, I went to see him a few days before he was selected as the president.

14:39.144 --> 14:40.827
And it turned out he was selected as the president.

14:40.847 --> 14:42.849
Of course, we had been freshmen in the same outfit.

14:43.130 --> 14:43.631
Oh, that's right.

14:43.671 --> 14:44.051
That's right.

14:44.071 --> 14:46.114
Yeah, you knew him well.

14:46.975 --> 14:53.143
When described moving you and your, were there any children at home then or it was just you and your wife?

14:53.364 --> 14:55.286
Well, I had one married daughter.

14:55.927 --> 14:57.970
I had one daughter who was going to school.

15:00.363 --> 15:01.604
here at Texas A&M.

15:01.965 --> 15:07.992
My oldest daughter had graduated from Southwest Texas and had come to Germany to stay with us for six months.

15:08.072 --> 15:11.676
She graduated in December, stayed with us six months until we came back.

15:12.317 --> 15:16.262
And as it turned out, I extended two more years and she just stayed with us.

15:17.543 --> 15:18.865
So she came from Germany with us.

15:18.885 --> 15:25.713
So I had my oldest daughter and my youngest daughter who was in junior high at that time or getting ready to go into junior high.

15:26.514 --> 15:27.375
So I had two with me.

15:27.495 --> 15:29.998
I had one married and then I had one here at Texas A&M.

15:30.147 --> 15:35.676
Describe what it was for you and your wife and those daughters to find a place to live here.

15:36.096 --> 15:53.944
Well, of course, we came and my wife's home was in Belton, so she went to Belton and I came down here and she came down and we looked at a few places and got a real estate agent to show us around, but there really weren't that many places.

15:54.160 --> 16:04.271
I was talking to Dr. Williams and told him, you know, I was staying in the motel and my wife was in Belton and she was running back and forth looking for a house.

16:04.352 --> 16:12.220
And so he volunteered to let me stay in an apartment, the president's apartment, which is over in the MSC.

16:12.301 --> 16:14.063
And we stayed over there a couple of weeks.

16:14.843 --> 16:18.528
And then I had my brother-in-law had a nice travel trailer.

16:18.588 --> 16:21.771
And so he brought it down for me and we put it in a little trailer park here.

16:21.791 --> 16:23.273
And so we stayed in the travel trailer.

16:24.029 --> 16:28.976
for probably a month to six weeks, I'm not sure how long it was, while we located a house.

16:28.996 --> 16:33.743
And it turned out the house we bought was one of the vice presidents here, Howard Vestal.

16:34.364 --> 16:38.469
We bought his house, I think it was the day that it came on the market.

16:39.270 --> 16:42.255
We went by and we made a deal on it then.

16:42.335 --> 16:46.521
And so I had already told my wife that we can't buy a new house.

16:46.561 --> 16:49.665
I have to have a house that's

16:50.202 --> 16:53.065
Yard is established, it's got shrubbery.

16:53.226 --> 16:57.231
I don't have any time to do anything except maybe mow the lawn.

16:57.931 --> 17:01.616
So we were looking for an older house or an established house.

17:02.517 --> 17:04.499
He was a P-38 pilot during the war.

17:04.660 --> 17:05.380
I didn't know that.

17:05.781 --> 17:06.682
I knew it was in the Air Force.

17:06.702 --> 17:13.811
He was in the first squadron that flew from Britain to North Africa in the fall of 42.

17:13.831 --> 17:19.838
I heard him tell they were given, literally given National Geographic

17:20.071 --> 17:27.845
maps of the Iberian Peninsula and told, do not, do not, do not violate the Spanish airspace.

17:27.885 --> 17:29.247
We don't want Franco to get in the war.

17:30.169 --> 17:37.862
And so they would fly around, and when they landed in North Africa, I believe he said they had 30 minutes or 15 minutes of fuel left.

17:38.844 --> 17:39.625
And that was all.

17:40.607 --> 17:43.632
And I've heard his wife tease him when he first got

17:44.118 --> 17:49.805
his wings and all that, how much he loved to have his white silk scarf around his neck.

17:50.426 --> 17:56.734
And one night on one of their dates that he got the scarf hung in the door when he closed the door.

17:57.495 --> 18:03.763
So you get settled in in the summer of 77.

18:04.098 --> 18:11.687
Describe the staff you inherited in the Trigon.

18:12.227 --> 18:15.972
Who were the key people on the commandant staff when you arrived?

18:15.992 --> 18:19.155
Well, the staff was very austere.

18:19.215 --> 18:21.959
We had Colonel Johnson, who was a retired lieutenant colonel.

18:22.159 --> 18:23.100
What was his first name?

18:23.340 --> 18:24.522
Don Johnson.

18:24.642 --> 18:25.062
Don?

18:25.082 --> 18:29.628
Don Johnson was the assistant commandant.

18:29.648 --> 18:31.810
And then we had

18:31.975 --> 18:37.462
part-time grad assistant and I'm not sure if that was Jake Betty.

18:37.822 --> 18:39.384
Jake Betty was there at one time.

18:39.565 --> 18:53.382
I'm not sure who it was, but and that was plus I had we had a receptionist and about we had about three or four typists and clerks and so forth.

18:53.402 --> 18:55.705
I think we had four in the office and

18:55.837 --> 18:57.799
And that was the Commandant's staff.

18:58.100 --> 19:00.303
And all of that was in the Trigon?

19:00.323 --> 19:03.266
Yes, it was all in that one office.

19:03.507 --> 19:07.291
Does that building have an official name other than Trigon?

19:07.491 --> 19:09.754
I think it's called the Trigon.

19:09.814 --> 19:11.577
I don't know that it has an official name.

19:12.798 --> 19:13.919
Was it yet air conditioned?

19:14.600 --> 19:16.703
It was air conditioned at that time.

19:17.644 --> 19:21.389
And so describe your first few weeks that summer.

19:21.709 --> 19:24.072
Well, of course, immediately,

19:26.060 --> 19:30.447
When I came, like I said, I came from Germany and started work, and they were having new student conferences.

19:30.967 --> 19:48.774
Well, I let Don Johnson take those for a while until I could find out what was going on, because it was where you would speak to all the incoming students, and then you'd speak to the parents, and there were about three different speeches that you would do in one new student conference.

19:48.854 --> 19:50.917
Sometimes there were two student conferences a week.

19:51.618 --> 19:55.324
So I let him do it a while, then I finally took over that

19:55.861 --> 20:07.035
that job and so that really kept me busy and you know, especially during August since it's 100 degrees and you're in your uniform trying to dash around the campus.

20:08.382 --> 20:13.329
And, of course, we were heavily recruiting, trying to, you know, trying to get as many freshmen as we could.

20:13.429 --> 20:20.399
And then we, of course, we started in late August at the FOW, and that was really the first look I'd gotten at the Corps.

20:20.419 --> 20:27.229
Of course, and then we had, we brought the commanders in, had a commander's conference, and that was the first look I got at the commanders, first chance I had to talk to them.

20:27.870 --> 20:36.162
Then immediately brought in the freshmen, and then school started, and we never, you know, we never slowed down until the end of school.

20:36.547 --> 20:40.252
And then you started the new student conferences again.

20:40.313 --> 20:42.696
So there really wasn't any slack time over there.

20:42.716 --> 20:45.500
You were fully committed 12 months a year.

20:46.382 --> 20:54.093
And all of the student corps leaders had been selected in the spring, had they not?

20:54.113 --> 20:54.934
Right, yeah.

20:55.135 --> 20:56.096
So you inherited?

20:56.456 --> 20:58.820
I inherited a new slate of commanders.

20:59.361 --> 21:03.567
And who was the key secretary for the Commandant?

21:04.002 --> 21:06.604
Well, it was Ann Harton at that time.

21:08.006 --> 21:08.506
H-A-R-T?

21:08.747 --> 21:09.848
H-O-R-T-O-N.

21:10.328 --> 21:11.489
H-O-R-T.

21:12.230 --> 21:13.751
I think that was who it was.

21:14.352 --> 21:19.657
And then we had this receptionist that had been there for years and years was Butch Toole.

21:20.678 --> 21:24.802
And I don't even know what Butch's first name is, but she always went by Butch.

21:24.822 --> 21:32.389
And I should explain that the Army sent me here as a professor of military science to run the Army ROTC program.

21:33.010 --> 21:35.513
But there was an agreement back in the 50s.

21:36.114 --> 21:47.909
At one time when we had General Malloy, or at that time Colonel Malloy and Colonel Boatner, they were the PMS and T's, they called them then, Professor of Military Science and Tactics.

21:48.369 --> 21:50.051
And they were the commandant.

21:50.852 --> 21:55.238
Well, then the, and that's, you only had Army ROTC at that time.

21:55.640 --> 22:03.992
and then had the Air Force ROTC, but they continued with the Army colonel in charge as a commandant.

22:04.053 --> 22:18.634
And then when the Korean War broke out, I don't know what happened, but Colonel Joe Davis, who was a university employee, who was the deputy commandant under Malloy and Boatner, he became the commandant.

22:18.654 --> 22:21.158
And he was the commandant for 10 or 11 years.

22:21.610 --> 22:26.656
And that would take you up to the early 60s, and then there was an agreement between the U.S.

22:26.776 --> 22:34.466
Army and Texas A&M that the senior Army officer would also serve as Commandant of Cadets.

22:35.026 --> 22:42.876
And so that's how the Army became the Commandant, the professor of military science.

22:42.976 --> 22:48.563
And of course, I think it was always resented by the Navy and by the Air Force that the Army officer was

22:49.133 --> 22:52.496
and it did cause some problems at times.

22:53.197 --> 22:58.302
Were most of the other officers on the Commandant staff, were most of them Army?

22:59.984 --> 23:01.105
Well, there was only one.

23:02.006 --> 23:04.208
That was Don Johnson, and he was Army.

23:04.369 --> 23:06.471
And he was Army, okay.

23:06.491 --> 23:15.580
Now, and had we yet done the, with Mr. Teague's assistant, had we gotten the Navy unit, meaning with the Marine Corps emphasis, had that yet?

23:16.100 --> 23:20.285
It was done under Colonel Parson, my predecessor.

23:20.545 --> 23:21.406
Okay.

23:21.426 --> 23:24.851
And so when you got here, some of those Corps members were?

23:25.251 --> 23:30.537
Yeah, we had Air Force and Navy with heavy Marine Corps.

23:30.557 --> 23:37.866
About, as well as you can remember, about how many members were in the Corps your first fall?

23:38.747 --> 23:41.871
Probably about 2,200.

23:42.577 --> 23:55.151
I know somewhere around there, I know that the most we had in the Corps during my five years was 19, I guess, 75, 76.

23:57.494 --> 23:59.896
And we had, we started out with 2,475.

24:01.798 --> 24:03.180
But normally we had 22, 2300.

24:03.981 --> 24:10.508
And as you began to

24:11.095 --> 24:14.020
evaluate the Corps when you got here.

24:14.801 --> 24:18.807
Compare it to the Corps you remembered that you left as a student.

24:19.148 --> 24:20.309
How had the Corps changed?

24:20.630 --> 24:26.719
Well, it was funny, but the Corps really hadn't changed that much over the years.

24:26.980 --> 24:31.026
It was still essentially the same type of organization.

24:31.066 --> 24:33.770
Now, of course, there were outward obvious changes.

24:33.810 --> 24:37.356
They had much better uniforms than we had.

24:37.657 --> 24:44.665
And I can't say the dorms were any better because they're the same old dorms that we lived in when I was a cadet.

24:46.287 --> 24:56.519
But primarily the uniforms and of course you had, you didn't have Saturday classes which was certainly a benefit to the Corps.

24:59.663 --> 25:03.107
And a quality of students.

25:05.332 --> 25:16.367
Well, I'm sure that when I came here, all you had to have was, you know, a little bit of money and a high school diploma and have some way to get here.

25:18.069 --> 25:23.717
Like I said before, you know, high school diploma, 200 bucks and ability to hitchhike, and you're an Aggie.

25:25.539 --> 25:30.626
But, of course, the entrance requirements were higher.

25:30.666 --> 25:32.689
I mean, they had the entrance requirements now.

25:33.243 --> 25:38.412
And so they were higher, and I'm sure academically they were better students.

25:40.375 --> 25:43.039
And numerically, about what was the comparison?

25:44.041 --> 25:45.583
How many were in the Corps?

25:46.184 --> 25:47.947
Well, somewhere between 22 and 2400.

25:48.248 --> 25:55.480
When I was in the Corps, it was about half the student body, or a little less than half, and the student body was around 9,000.

25:55.840 --> 25:59.807
So there'd be 4,000 to 4,500 in the Corps.

26:00.378 --> 26:07.870
So, four occupied, when you became Commandant, about what percentage of the core dorm area?

26:07.890 --> 26:11.536
Well, of the 12 dorms, they occupied, I think, 10.

26:12.357 --> 26:13.419
And that was my goal.

26:13.619 --> 26:14.621
I had several goals.

26:14.761 --> 26:19.849
One was to, you know, get 2,500 cadets, and another one was to have all 12 dormitories.

26:20.290 --> 26:22.133
Well, I got 2,475.

26:22.450 --> 26:25.113
And I did at one time have all 12 dormitories.

26:25.173 --> 26:33.384
However, there was one dormitory where we had the females that had two floors of cadets and two floors of civilian students.

26:34.745 --> 26:39.852
And what were your other goals when you took over as coming up?

26:40.072 --> 26:48.222
Well, the 2,500, the 12 dormitories, and improve the discipline of the Corps.

26:49.670 --> 26:56.158
Did anybody give you any advice, any directions, any counsel as you're beginning?

26:56.759 --> 27:01.264
Well, I talked daily, and I visited daily with General Simpson.

27:01.284 --> 27:02.966
He was the key person you talked about?

27:03.026 --> 27:08.933
He was the key person and my inspiration, my mentor, I guess.

27:09.254 --> 27:13.579
And we discussed many things, you know, about the Corps.

27:13.599 --> 27:16.082
However, he never came out and told me

27:17.294 --> 27:19.678
what to do or that I had to do something.

27:20.298 --> 27:29.172
I would usually, if I was going to do something, I would go and discuss it with him to tell him what I was going to do.

27:30.273 --> 27:32.637
And he was very supportive in everything.

27:33.037 --> 27:34.960
Now his office was where?

27:34.980 --> 27:36.102
It was in the YMCA.

27:36.162 --> 27:36.903
In the YMCA.

27:36.923 --> 27:39.206
Yeah, along with John Colas.

27:39.306 --> 27:41.009
Right near John Colas.

27:42.131 --> 27:45.816
Was he in civilian attire each day or a suit?

27:46.066 --> 27:53.312
The only time he ever appeared in uniform was that on a few occasions.

27:53.613 --> 28:00.299
One is that he was normally the commissioning officer during the summer and he would appear in his uniform at that time.

28:01.400 --> 28:15.212
And there may have been another time that he appeared in uniform but I think for the Marine Corps ball or Marine Corps birthday party he would be in his uniform but not over two or three times a year.

28:15.631 --> 28:22.280
Did I mention to you the story he told me about when he became division commander in the Marine Corps?

28:22.921 --> 28:23.622
No.

28:23.942 --> 28:29.289
This is for the typist to put this as an editorial note.

28:30.290 --> 28:42.246
General Simpson told me that when he became, I believe it was the 1st Marine Division, and he learned to his shock that somebody had removed all of the battle streamers

28:42.715 --> 28:46.761
from the division's official flags.

28:46.881 --> 28:47.321
Colors.

28:47.461 --> 28:47.842
Colors.

28:49.144 --> 28:56.834
And he wanted to have those put back in some appropriate manner.

28:56.854 --> 29:02.001
And he found that those streamers went back all the way to the Spanish-American War.

29:02.983 --> 29:07.048
Now this was, they were stationed at, what's the Marine base near San Diego?

29:08.871 --> 29:10.313
Kent Pendleton, is that right?

29:10.353 --> 29:11.254
Yeah, Kent Pendleton.

29:11.707 --> 29:17.773
And he learned that there were retirees living in the area from every campaign.

29:17.813 --> 29:22.697
And so he had the whole division present.

29:22.717 --> 29:30.324
And he had a veteran come up who had served in that campaign to put that back over.

29:31.325 --> 29:37.271
He said, I realized after that day I never had to worry about pride and spirit anymore.

29:38.112 --> 29:41.595
But that was a truly, truly touching experience.

29:41.913 --> 29:47.862
He said, not only for the young men in the outfit, but certainly for the new division commander.

29:48.763 --> 29:54.892
And I've always thought, too, that seems to me like prototypical Simpson.

29:55.653 --> 29:57.456
He was that kind of a man.

29:58.658 --> 30:07.050
Did any other, did president, vice president, board members, former students, anybody else give you advice?

30:07.150 --> 30:10.435
Oh, I got advice from former students, yeah.

30:10.820 --> 30:11.881
Share some of it.

30:11.901 --> 30:13.563
What was it like?

30:13.583 --> 30:15.825
Plus or minus?

30:15.845 --> 30:23.694
One guy, I had had a little confrontation with the core staff, and we can go into that a little later.

30:23.854 --> 30:26.116
Oh, yes, we'd like that.

30:26.136 --> 30:27.378
At the beginning of school.

30:27.438 --> 30:30.481
It wasn't really a confrontation, but it was, you know, an understanding.

30:31.502 --> 30:34.245
And so one of my classmates came up to me

30:34.833 --> 30:40.821
at one of the first football games and said, well, I understand that you're just about to destroy the Corps.

30:41.862 --> 30:45.907
And I just looked at him and I said, well, I'm not sure that you really know what you're talking about.

30:45.987 --> 30:47.950
And that was the end of that conversation.

30:48.911 --> 31:01.988
And then, of course, they had the famous saber incident, and I had all kind of letters that when I took the sabers away from the ODs, which is another story,

31:02.592 --> 31:10.243
that I was accused of destroying traditions at A&M and old armies going to hell.

31:10.363 --> 31:14.690
And so, you know, I just had to ignore most of that.

31:14.850 --> 31:16.012
I'd get those letters.

31:16.032 --> 31:17.454
A lot of them I wouldn't even answer.

31:17.514 --> 31:21.139
They were so stupid, you know, wouldn't honor them with an answer.

31:22.081 --> 31:25.266
But I got plenty of advice, primary and former students.

31:26.788 --> 31:28.330
John Colas really...

31:28.732 --> 31:34.662
You know, he let General Simpson handle the Corps.

31:34.782 --> 31:39.610
And as far as Board of Regents, all I got was support from them.

31:40.231 --> 31:44.057
So nobody gave you marching orders when you get in

31:44.324 --> 31:59.380
do this this this no i really didn't this kind of did it uh you know all right as as the routine started then that fall uh describe a typical week for uh for the
