WEBVTT

00:01.769 --> 00:04.412
I hope. I believe it's already connected and now 
we'll see if it's actually picking up sound in the

00:04.612 --> 00:12.500
room. Let's see, I'll ask some questions. All of 
your family is from Texas, right? You want to take

00:18.447 --> 00:20.549
it right here? Yeah, I'll play it back to you.

00:28.651 --> 00:31.495
Well, not right now. It's for a demonstration now. 
Well, I'm from here. He's from Mexico. What town

00:38.804 --> 00:39.985
are you from? Bustamante. Bustamante. 
Tamaulipas. Tamaulipas. There are two

00:45.092 --> 00:46.594
Bustamantes. Yes. Nuevo León. Yes, I know this. 
Near Monterrey. Yes. And the other Bustamante is

00:54.203 --> 00:56.346
very far. On the other side of Victoria. On the 
other side of Victoria. And it's the house of your

01:01.335 --> 01:05.740
mother and father? Yes, my brother and father. But 
are they all from Mexico? Yes. And what is your

01:12.448 --> 01:13.689
father's name? Severino, Severino Medina. 
Severino Medina. And your mother? Taurina.

01:22.519 --> 01:23.700
Taurina. In what year did they come to the United 
States? In 1918. What was the reason they came?

01:34.853 --> 01:37.557
What do you mean?

01:40.543 --> 01:41.845
What was the reason? Why did they come? They came 
for the war. For the war? For the revolution. They

01:47.715 --> 01:48.456
didn't have... What kind of work did your father 
have in Mexico?

01:58.598 --> 02:00.600
He was here. He didn't know what kind of work, 
because there was no work. What was

02:09.410 --> 02:17.278
the reason for the revolution? How old were you 
when you came here?

02:26.215 --> 02:27.958
How old were you? I came when I was 15. I was the 
oldest. 15? 15 years old. The other boys came when

02:37.552 --> 02:44.683
they were little. OK.

03:18.768 --> 03:19.609
good as mine. And he was telling me something. . . . . 
.

03:42.832 --> 03:48.620
We came on foot and then we took the train at night 
for a while. The next day we walked on foot. How long

03:52.566 --> 03:56.411
did it take? How long did it take for your uncle to 
get out of

03:56.431 --> 04:05.103
there? My uncle took about a month or five weeks. 
And how was it possible to eat?

04:17.153 --> 04:19.917
What did your family eat? What did they eat? Yes, 
what did they eat? Well, almost bread, only bread

04:23.422 --> 04:29.591
and water. Sometimes there was everything, but 
there was nothing to buy. My uncle brought money,

04:36.241 --> 04:39.045
just limited, little. Yes. Yes. Yes.

04:47.730 --> 05:07.075
Is there

04:47.730 --> 05:07.075
any

04:47.730 --> 05:07.075
illness

04:47.730 --> 05:07.075
there? Fernando came sick. Yes, one or two boys 
came, little ones, my brothers came sick. Yes.

05:19.799 --> 05:28.212
Well, if there was nothing to eat, well, give him a 
doctor and all that, because there was nothing to

05:19.799 --> 05:28.212
eat. And the water, was it good or bad? Well, what we 
found, sometimes a little good, sometimes bad.

05:36.181 --> 05:36.501
Yes. And what time of year was it? What year? What 
time of year?

05:52.159 --> 06:04.433
In this month, the 8th, the 8th of January, the 
18th, we passed the royal. And are there soldiers?

06:07.860 --> 06:07.920
No. Are there problems with soldiers? Well, they 
came to us with fear and they never saw us. And God

06:14.646 --> 06:23.375
did not see us and covered us because there can be no 
other way. And for what reason did he decide to

06:25.116 --> 06:33.424
leave his people? At this time, is there a very big, 
special problem or something else? Yes. Because

06:43.544 --> 06:46.889
that year, the uncle decided to go to Taerios. They 
had a very different year, Frivi and all. An uncle.

06:54.360 --> 06:59.107
But they walked hidden until San Antonio. Yes. 
From San Antonio They came to College Station in a

07:01.450 --> 07:05.216
bus. No, from Laredo they came in a bus. They spent 
the whole year. Locked up, without food, without

07:13.169 --> 07:14.692
drink. Plus the driver brought them. That's where 
those two sick creatures came from. What year did

07:20.862 --> 07:23.847
they arrive at College Station? Here, what can I 
say? The same year, in the same month, yes. He

07:31.686 --> 07:34.830
wanted to know the date of the year, right? I mean, 
it seems like the 15th, the 17th. The 18th. The 18th

07:42.801 --> 07:43.602
they arrived. The 18th? For what reason did they 
come here, to Bryan? No, we were outside of Bryan,

07:49.270 --> 07:52.855
at the ranch. It's a ranch close to here? Yes, it's 
about 25,000. We came here in... 1944. We lived in

08:02.483 --> 08:05.889
Texas. Yes. But when we came from Mexico, we went to 
work in a ranch 20 miles away from here. Yes.

08:18.974 --> 08:25.041
¿Y su papá fue campesino o comerciante? No, 
comenzaron a trabajar en Desenraiz con un... Para

08:25.221 --> 08:32.430
limpiar tierra, para sembrar. ¿En México? No, 
aquí. ¿Aquí? Sí, 20 millas afuera de Brown. Y aquí

08:41.060 --> 08:45.505
nos venimos hace unos 25 años, nos venimos para... 
But before what, in Bustamante, what kind of work

08:46.177 --> 08:49.922
did he have? Well, just sowing, reed corn, you 
know. That's the main thing in Mexico. Yes. Did he

09:02.719 --> 09:04.281
have his own land? We lived there on a ranch and it 
never rained. I don't know how we make a living.

09:12.531 --> 09:15.255
They irrigated, they were irrigation lands. Yes. 
Did you own the land? No, no. Did you rent it? No, I

09:23.735 --> 09:24.957
didn't. I was with someone else, with the owners of 
the land. Ah, yes. And then, in 1918, your mother

09:32.824 --> 09:38.929
and father went to the United States. My 
grandfather, my grandmother. And you. and two

09:44.665 --> 09:51.672
sons-in-law, one son-in-law came with their 
grandparents. You are Mr.

09:52.445 --> 09:59.595
Medina and your other name is? He is Medina. 
Medina. Alquilio C. Medina. Alquilio C. Medina.

10:06.004 --> 10:08.006
Alquilio C. Medina. Alquilio C. Medina. And his 
mother and father and the whole family. Medina.

10:13.954 --> 10:14.555
His brothers. And his uncle? His name was Juan 
Contreras. His mother's brother? Yes, his

10:24.436 --> 10:27.379
mother's brother. And he came to Texas first? Yes, 
he was here, he was many years old. He and her father

10:37.571 --> 10:40.454
always lived in the same ranch. Oh, his family 
still knows your family. Yes. Because his aunt...

10:47.390 --> 10:53.117
My father was from his people. Very close, very 
retired. My mother was nothing. But she was from

10:58.003 --> 11:02.809
Texas and he was from Mexico. And they know each 
other. They are very distant relatives. Very

11:10.439 --> 11:11.200
distant. Very distant. But they were very close 
people. And for this reason, your family came to

11:17.039 --> 11:22.785
Wheelback during these years. Yes. And

11:23.947 --> 11:30.133
for how many years? When did you find him? When did 
he find you? Me and him? Yes. Well, we got married in

11:36.300 --> 11:42.507
1920. El 15 de octubre. She was 15. That's what I'm 
saying. That's what I'm saying. Just the little

11:50.736 --> 11:53.119
kids and they got married. They got married in 
1920. I don't want to say this because... He was 18

12:00.327 --> 12:04.972
and I was 16 years old. He is older than me, 4 years. 
Yes. How

12:12.507 --> 12:42.278
many

12:12.507 --> 12:42.278
years

12:12.507 --> 12:42.278
does

12:12.507 --> 12:42.278
he live in Wheelock?

12:44.131 --> 12:48.757
About 30 years. In what year did you come here to 
Bryan? In 1942, I think. And what kind of work do you

12:57.247 --> 13:01.453
have here in Bryan? Well, just looking for work. 
The first years, I worked as a baker. And I worked as

13:11.625 --> 13:13.868
a butcher. Y después buscamos trabajo aquí en él. Y 
yo comencé a trabajar en un garage. Sí. Él comenzó a

13:23.611 --> 13:27.816
trabajar en College Station, en un comedor, ¿te 
acuerdas? Pero después. Después del garage.

13:33.402 --> 13:37.186
Y trabajé una temporada en el garage. Y luego paré y 
fui a College Station.

13:42.192 --> 13:42.893
Allí pues... I worked in a dining room, washing 
dishes, sweeping, mapping.

13:55.637 --> 14:00.143
From there, I would go to the car station, and I 
would come back to the garage.

14:05.970 --> 14:07.132
And... I still remember that day. I forgot the 
material. And have you ever returned to Mexico to

14:11.392 --> 14:16.059
visit? No, we haven't returned there. No? No. He 
left something out. He retired when he got hurt on

14:24.371 --> 14:27.256
his eye. Ah. He retired. He retired. In what year 
did you retire? In what year did he retire? He

14:36.269 --> 14:37.551
retired three years ago. Three years ago. Three 
years ago, yes. And you never want to visit Mexico?

14:46.526 --> 14:48.088
Well, no, we don't have money. That's another 
reason. And I say that you need money because here

14:51.652 --> 14:59.602
the neighbors go and they bring a lot of money. Yes. 
What kind of house does your family have in Mexico?

15:06.551 --> 15:07.032
Do you remember? It's from Madero

15:07.838 --> 15:12.403
or what? Your house, your family's house in 
Mexico, in Bustamante. What kind of house? Well,

15:18.631 --> 15:26.039
houses like the ones in Aguas Pobres, they look 
like they're... They're old? No, they're...

15:27.561 --> 15:34.369
What's it called, Amara? It was like straw. They 
made different houses, but like garbage. They

15:47.723 --> 15:48.765
tied it up. They made carts out of it. Carrizo. 
Carrizo, I don't know how they call it. Have you

15:55.927 --> 15:59.331
seen that big bush over there that looks like corn? 
Yes. That's what I told you it was carrizo. They dry

16:03.496 --> 16:05.880
it and they stop it like this. Yes. And they put 
leaves like this and then they add carrizo. Ah,

16:12.047 --> 16:13.029
yes. You must have seen some when they went to 
Mexico. Look like a tins. Tins, something like

16:17.895 --> 16:20.438
tins. Like this. Oh, yes. I think I've seen houses 
like that in Tlamalipas. Sí. Sí.

16:34.222 --> 16:36.685
Have you seen anyone? I haven't seen him, but his 
mother and the people from the medical center. Ah,

16:39.809 --> 16:42.833
his mother says all these things. They put 
tortillas like this on their arms. They burned

16:45.717 --> 16:54.048
firewood and they put a comal like this and they put 
tortillas. And they hid them because they heard

16:54.068 --> 16:57.633
them and they came and took them away. They 
suffered a lot in Mexico. That's why he didn't want

17:01.418 --> 17:03.300
to go to Mexico. I don't blame you. I'll never go. I 
never want to go. I don't want to. Why not? It's very

17:13.246 --> 17:14.087
nice. I do want to go one day. One day I want to go 
there. I don't like it. I want to go to the ranch

17:19.573 --> 17:23.618
where my father and mother live. Ah, the ranch. My 
mother lives there. Yes? Your mother lives there?

17:28.604 --> 17:29.164
In Mexico? In the ranch. Ah, yes. The two of them are 
dead. Yes. One day, I want to go back. This young man

17:39.078 --> 17:44.246
is the one who has gone from the whole family to 
Mexico. Those two have gone, but this one has been

17:44.266 --> 17:48.532
in the family home of his wife. Yes. In Aguas 
Calientes. Ah. And from there, he has been to

17:52.978 --> 17:55.422
Monterrey and all that. I don't know, I don't know. 
You know, on vacation they go see them. They've got

17:59.843 --> 18:01.545
people in the nest. His wife, family, they live in 
the nest. He is very handsome. Then there was

18:09.191 --> 18:14.396
nothing to do with him, just the firewood. Yes. 
Now, my sister-in-law says that there is beauty in

18:14.616 --> 18:20.341
some parts. In Bustamante? Yes. Yes. But in the 
past? No. Just the firewood. There were schools

18:27.436 --> 18:36.144
there when you were a child? There were schools? 
Yes, before the war. When the war, there was

18:46.794 --> 18:48.795
nothing. In what year began, how do you say began? 
The war began there. 1810. 1910. 1910.

19:07.109 --> 19:12.093
Y su familia vive en este pueblo con la guerra para 
ocho años? Pues el papá de él se fue con los

19:13.615 --> 19:17.278
soldados. Y él se quedó a atender la familia. 
¿Usted? Mi papá se lo llevaron. Vente, vamos. No,

19:25.326 --> 19:27.868
que mi mamá no vente, vamos. They took

19:28.405 --> 19:32.970
him away. I don't know what happened. I was older, 
and the other two were younger. I don't know what my

19:38.636 --> 19:43.901
mother did for us. My father wasn't there. He 
didn't have any money or anything. And your father

19:48.006 --> 19:49.988
was a soldier? What kind of general was he? Zapata 
was a general. Pancho Viena? Yes, with Carranza

20:00.641 --> 20:04.027
and Villa. Carranza and Villa. But your father 
returned to Bustamente in what year? Yes, he was

20:13.122 --> 20:16.468
lucky that he returned. And then there was nothing 
to eat, there was nothing, no work. It came to mind.

20:25.119 --> 20:31.067
He had an idea of where there was enough corn to eat. 
Yes. And he said, before my children, these

20:32.109 --> 20:42.343
creatures die of hunger, let's go there. And so he 
took us to a place where there was a lot of water, a

20:43.344 --> 20:52.176
lot of corn. People died not of hunger, but of 
sickness. Very sick, because they drank river

20:56.325 --> 21:00.173
water. There was no water left to drink from the 
river. What is this river called?

21:11.436 --> 21:14.502
The river of Santa Ingracia. From Santa Ingracia? 
Yes, I think you live there. I know him! You live in

21:20.987 --> 21:23.730
Mexico, I think I know him. In your town, right? 
Yes, I know him. Bustamante is close to Santa

21:28.035 --> 21:31.479
Ingracia? From Hacienda de Santa Ingracia? From 
Nuevo León, yes. It's over here. How many miles,

21:35.904 --> 21:40.009
more or less, separated are the two places? How 
many miles separated are they? I don't have an

21:41.670 --> 21:43.172
idea. About 300 miles. 300? Well, that's quite 
far. But the river was... There was a place called

21:53.466 --> 21:57.730
La Cruz. Yes. It's close to Santa Yengra. Another 
place where the train stops. The train that comes

22:06.819 --> 22:11.663
from there, it goes from here to Monterrey, and it 
stops there at La Cruz. Ah. La Cruz and Santé András

22:14.152 --> 22:23.043
are in the middle, not very far, one of

22:14.152 --> 22:23.043
the two. And that's the name of the river, the Santé 
András River. It's where a lot of people were sick.

22:32.074 --> 22:32.194
Yes. But it's during this trip. this disease was 
during the trip? When they got sick? Yes, well,

22:42.484 --> 22:53.161
some of them came, and one of them had already got 
up, and other sick people came, and my uncle said,

22:42.484 --> 22:53.161
well, let's go. Well, this boy is very bad. You 
know, wherever he dies, we bury him. We have to keep

22:57.948 --> 23:01.253
walking. Like the Israelis. But all these people 
would have stayed there. But God puts the means. Do

23:09.966 --> 23:11.048
you understand me? Yes. They started writing to 
the uncle. Yes. By letters. Yes. And we, as we were

23:19.818 --> 23:24.964
here, he said, my father's name was Ignacio, his 
name was Juan. He went and told him, Ignacio, my

23:25.084 --> 23:30.210
father is very bad there, my sister, my 
brother-in-law. They are very bad there. What do

23:32.470 --> 23:33.031
you think? What will we do? The two of them were from 
Mexico. Yes. Today we are going to gather this

23:36.556 --> 23:41.684
family and the other and we will help you. Many 
helped that uncle so that he could bring them. And

23:46.672 --> 23:48.915
he left alone. He left alone with a bag of clothes 
only for him. He knew very well that he was going to

23:52.661 --> 23:54.403
suffer there. But they... They were just running 
away. They were just in a house. It was dark and it

24:02.525 --> 24:04.388
didn't dawn. He put them all in motion and they all 
came. His father, his mother, his grandmother,

24:09.334 --> 24:18.567
his grandson, his grandchildren, his 
grandchildren, because they had already buried

24:09.334 --> 24:18.567
three of the virgulas. There was only one behind 
the other. And when they came from there, they came

24:21.872 --> 24:26.218
in pain because they had left their daughters 
buried. but they were running away from that

24:26.705 --> 24:29.088
revolution. They couldn't eat, they couldn't 
make their food, because if they made it, they

24:31.271 --> 24:41.104
would smell it, they would add tortillas, they 
would smell it, and they would come and take it

24:31.271 --> 24:41.104
away. If they brought a blanket, they would take it 
away. All they wanted was to live. But his father

24:45.991 --> 24:51.398
was already free from the revolution, they had 
already left him. The worst thing he did was to

24:51.558 --> 24:53.922
leave. And they came, And he transported them by 
boat. Yes. They didn't go by, you know, by train or

24:57.539 --> 25:03.787
something. No, they went by boat. One behind the 
other, one behind the other. And they were hidden

25:09.914 --> 25:12.517
in a house. Yes. And in that house, there was a bus 
that picked them up to San Antonio. From San

25:21.245 --> 25:22.587
Antonio. Yes, from San Antonio. He sent Ken out of 
here to bring them. Then they walked in huayines.

25:29.555 --> 25:31.958
Do you know what huayines are? Huayin. Huayin. 
Huayin. They were two big huayines. Yes, from all

25:36.344 --> 25:38.466
over. From the family that he had here. And they 
brought them. I remember well. I was little. I was

25:44.253 --> 25:45.755
nine years old. Yes. I was nine years old. Y todos 
nos juntamos a dar ropa, a dar comida cuando ellos

25:48.785 --> 25:53.592
vinieran. Sí. Y en Guadalini, entre las nieves, 
muchos veían. Pero así venían todas cobijaditas

25:58.779 --> 26:10.695
de luto, todas muchachas, no muchachas que estas, 
todas de luto porque habían dejado hermanos,

25:58.779 --> 26:10.695
sobrinos, enterrados. Un tío de él fue afusilado 
en esa guerra por malicia. And my mother-in-law

26:18.097 --> 26:27.707
cried a lot and said, when I got married, she told me 
from there, if you saw how sad the revolution is,

26:18.097 --> 26:27.707
you don't know. When they shot my brother, she 
said, did you know what time it was when the sun came

26:27.727 --> 26:36.195
out? Did you know what time they were going to shoot 
him? And where they shot him, so close to our house.

26:42.751 --> 26:51.199
My mom and we were all in that corner, praying, 
asking God for the brother who was going to be shot.

26:53.121 --> 26:56.004
And they heard the shots. Oh, it was so sad. But they 
suffered a lot. Yes. That uncle of his had just been

27:01.149 --> 27:04.372
shot when they came here. His name was... What was 
his name? Petronilo. Petronilo Contreras. They

27:12.569 --> 27:18.557
just shot them because at that time, even if they 
didn't go, they would say, you did it, you did it.

27:18.577 --> 27:21.220
And as they grabbed one here, the police, don't 
talk. But they shot them.

27:26.928 --> 27:28.710
It's a very sad story. We went from being wet. You 
know what wet is. Mojado? Wet? All mojado. Wet

27:38.254 --> 27:39.276
bags. Oh, all mojado. Y después aquí tuvimos que 
arreglar. No quisieron echarnos, pero

27:45.752 --> 27:52.228
arreglamos y pagamos los... In these years, there 
aren't many people on the border to make papers,

27:52.951 --> 28:01.725
right? Now, yes, we have the papers. But they were 
reporting for many years that they weren't from

28:03.428 --> 28:09.778
here. Yes. It was a bad past, yes. But they said, 
well, let's go to Langley.

28:19.715 --> 28:27.482
But in the citizenship papers, there they had to 
say what the reason was for them to come here. And

28:27.563 --> 28:31.366
they had a very big excuse, because defending 
life, you know. Yes, yes, I think so. That's why

28:33.288 --> 28:34.389
they were forgiven. But it's a very delicate thing 
to say that. But in the scriptures it says that

28:37.812 --> 28:44.319
there was a very big reason for them to run away. 
Yes. And that uncle was the one who saved all those

28:44.779 --> 28:47.882
people.

28:51.102 --> 28:58.772
But now you are a citizen. When I married him, they 
told me that I had lost my citizenship here. That he

29:10.928 --> 29:14.393
had made me Mexican. But a lot of people told me, fix 
your papers, because if you don't fix your papers,

29:14.845 --> 29:22.855
he can't be a citizen. And I fixed my papers, and I 
said, well, why if I'm here? But he was from there.

29:27.340 --> 29:30.724
At that time, they made one of them. Now they

29:30.744 --> 29:35.750
don't. And I fixed my papers, and he fixed his. 
Because with my papers, I made him a citizen. Yes.

29:43.118 --> 29:48.505
But that's how my in-laws and their citizens have 
been doing it. Many of my brothers-in-law have

29:48.705 --> 29:53.191
become citizens. And he is a citizen. So he doesn't 
have to report anything anymore. He reports his

29:57.457 --> 30:04.225
portrait

29:57.457 --> 30:04.225
of his land. And your grandparents, do they like it 
here? No, they don't like it anymore. No, he died,

30:10.113 --> 30:11.835
he's buried in a hole. But when they came here,

30:12.220 --> 30:27.595
did they like life here? Yes. One thing they didn't 
like was that he had put corn tortillas Y le daban,

30:39.187 --> 30:41.730
no, yo no quiero. La tortilla de harina no la 
quería, que le hacía mal. Eso era lo único que no le

30:47.196 --> 30:50.679
gustaba a ella. Lo demás sí, todo

30:50.700 --> 30:58.228
le gustaba. ¿Y su mamá y papá también le gusta? Sí, 
sí.

31:07.992 --> 31:16.521
And even if he doesn't like it, he has whatever he 
wants. He's very old. My father is old, but he's

31:20.065 --> 31:25.351
still alive. Your father is still alive? Yes. How 
old are you? Seventy-seven. Seventy-seven years

31:31.577 --> 31:35.081
old. Quite old. He still roams around, you know? 
What are you going to show him? Look, that is it. The

31:43.024 --> 31:44.425
daddy, you know? Yes. Oh, it's your mama? Uh-huh. 
No, she's dead. Oh, she's, uh-huh. That's daddy,

31:50.471 --> 31:51.612
granddaddy. He's leaving, but she's dead. But 
where does he live? He lives not even two blocks

31:55.176 --> 31:57.458
from here. Right here. Down behind that golf 
station, down the road. That's my granddaddy.

32:05.526 --> 32:06.467
That's daddy's van. You know that golf station 
over here? Yeah. Right behind

32:11.627 --> 32:18.719
it. Maybe he would like to. He might like to. That 
would be... If one of you could take me and

32:25.872 --> 32:30.700
introduce me to him, All

32:31.118 --> 32:43.910
right. Sometime during the week, I could call you 
and ask if it would be a good day. Because he might

32:49.835 --> 32:58.763
like to tell about it, and he could maybe say some 
things that he would remember having been older

32:49.835 --> 32:58.763
than you. He has his own? Yes. Ah, how nice to make 
this story about him too. Where is your town? What?

33:09.521 --> 33:10.202
Your town. Your hometown. Oh, me? From Missouri? 
Neosho, Missouri. Missouri?

33:22.014 --> 33:22.134
Yes. And then my family came to Texas when I had... 
Diez y cuatro años. Casi la misma con usted vienen a

33:30.708 --> 33:35.140
Texas. Diez y cuatro años. Catorce. Catorce. 
Gracias. Yo me olvido mucho español. Bueno, 14

33:46.783 --> 33:47.825
años. Y viven en Huntsville. Es que cerca de aquí. Y 
después yo fueron a Louisiana para mis estudios en

33:53.251 --> 33:58.318
la universidad. Y me encuentro mi esposo allá. Y él 
es de Louisiana. Oh. Él es un, bueno, su familia de

34:04.526 --> 34:11.815
Louisiana es un parte, un parte francesa. or 
Cajun, a part German, a part Irish. How do you say

34:23.532 --> 34:25.939
Irish? No, no, no. Irish. From Ireland. From 
Ireland and also from Spain. From Spain. And also

34:36.811 --> 34:46.105
another part of England and Scotland. My brother 
is a teacher in a school out there. The little one is

34:50.412 --> 34:54.197
a teacher in a school out there. But he's from 
Louisiana, right? Yes, my husband. This little

34:57.943 --> 35:07.097
boy spent about three or four months in Louisiana 
National

34:57.943 --> 35:07.097
Guard. He finished college and then he went to 
Virginia. There are a lot of French people in

35:10.822 --> 35:13.687
Louisiana. Yes, a lot. How many children do you 
have?

35:23.891 --> 35:24.452
Nine. Nine? That's good.

35:31.143 --> 35:34.087
Six sisters, six daughters. And three brothers. 
Children. And the older brothers. No one's home,

35:41.317 --> 35:42.458
everybody's married. Were you the last one to 
marry? I'm the last one to marry. Are you the

35:45.102 --> 35:45.983
youngest? He was the baby one, and then he beat me, 
and I was the last one, you know, to get married. And

35:59.359 --> 36:00.761
this is one of your sons? Ah, sobrino. El que 
agarramos allá. Pero estos... They take in

They was taken

36:21.182 --> 36:31.378

brothers-in-law,

36:35.688 --> 36:53.015
they're already

36:35.688 --> 36:53.015
there.

36:56.360 --> 36:57.021
He died. This one. How sad. This is his husband. 
Yes. And him? He's in LABO. Ah, LABO. What kind of

37:09.836 --> 37:11.478

Rosie. I was

41:30.241 --> 41:44.894
looking at it. I think it's run out. This was the one 
that was making the noise. The first one and the

41:54.203 --> 41:58.847
last one. This is the last one. The last one and the 
first one. See? The oldest one and the last one.

42:10.824 --> 42:13.768
This is the baby. It doesn't look like it here. I'm 
telling you, baby, you were very pretty when you

42:15.269 --> 42:22.418
were little, but now you're very ugly. Where is the 
other picture?

42:26.903 --> 42:27.163
This one. Yo le digo, ahora estás muy feo. No, no es 
feo. Pero mire, cuando nos vinimos para acá, así

42:32.699 --> 42:37.024

estábamos con los belices listos para venirnos

hermanas, las que están ahorita en el hospital.

43:00.089 --> 43:07.260
They married two brothers and two sisters.

43:07.281 --> 43:08.262
Carmen and James. Oh, what a pretty dress. Where 
are they going? She made the party. Ella lo hizo.

43:17.076 --> 43:17.357
Sí. She made. Mm. Beautiful. They were having a 
dance, a dance, and they had to wear a kimono.

43:25.130 --> 43:25.390
Mm-hmm. She, that looks, that's... Oh, she is 
pretty. These are sisters. No, no, no. They're the

43:31.918 --> 43:33.139
same one. The same one. Mm-hmm. She got those two 
babies married. Mm. Oh, they're pretty, too. Oh,

43:40.528 --> 43:43.371
thank you.

43:51.839 --> 43:54.682
There's the teacher. There's the teacher. And 
he's got a little baby, too. And they've been

44:09.336 --> 44:11.518
married five years already. Is she from here, or is 
she from somewhere? She's from Port Arthur. From

He's cute. They're all cute. Well, their father is 
muy guapo.

That's the same one. Here it is with them.
