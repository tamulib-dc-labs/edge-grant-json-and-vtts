WEBVTT

00:06.157 --> 00:12.626
As I was saying, the department did purchase a 
birdshot, which at 2 to 3 feet is deadly, but at 20 to

00:06.157 --> 00:12.626
30 feet is not. And at least at that point, we had 
something as an alternative between the use of a

00:13.468 --> 00:24.083
wooden stick and an absolute deadly force. We 
still do not have it. Rubber bullets are available

00:28.634 --> 00:30.897
and so forth. And certainly chemical agents are 
available as a means to try to affect crowd

00:31.217 --> 00:36.583
control. But we still do not have even developed 
what I suppose one would call weapon systems that

00:38.205 --> 00:53.163
are useful in that kind of situation in the sense of 
being injurious enough to get someone's

00:38.205 --> 00:53.163
attention, but not so injurious as to maim or kill. 
OK. Did the increase of blacks and women in the

00:54.841 --> 00:58.870
force have any impact on crowd control? MR. No, not 
appreciably. Not appreciably. People, I don't

01:02.979 --> 01:14.284
care what your background is, what your ideology 
is, when you get in a crowd control situation and

01:02.979 --> 01:14.284
you're over there in that uniform, you're a 
uniform, period. The amount of solidarity and

01:14.500 --> 01:21.910
unity is just absolutely as strong as you can 
imagine in that sort of situation. Your life

01:21.950 --> 01:28.600
depends upon the backing of someone next to you and 
vice versa, and it just doesn't make much

01:21.950 --> 01:28.600
difference. I had read an article in the U.S. News 
and World Report where Cleveland hired some black

01:28.980 --> 01:36.871
officers to go into the ghetto situations, and 
they said it didn't work. Didn't, no. In fact, I

01:38.554 --> 01:42.499
would speculate that in some situations you might 
aggravate it in the sense that... those officers

01:43.610 --> 01:50.557
might be less sympathetic or less tolerant than 
what white officers might be. That's pure

01:50.597 --> 01:56.382
speculation, I hasten to add, but it's not going to 
make an enormous amount of difference. Was crowd

01:57.463 --> 02:05.230
control or maybe just crime itself, general 
crime, an issue in the 1968 campaign? And if so,

02:05.751 --> 02:08.553
what were Nixon and Johnson's stance on the issue? 
Well, it certainly was an issue in the 1968

02:09.354 --> 02:13.498
campaign. Those were certainly 
understatements, say, turbulent years of the

02:14.474 --> 02:20.780
United States. And

02:21.821 --> 02:43.401
looking back, I don't think that Nixon, clearly he 
campaigned on very vague promises with regard to

02:21.821 --> 02:43.401
both what he would do about situations in the black 
ghettos and with regard to the Vietnam War. But

02:44.545 --> 02:55.916
Lyndon Johnson had the unfortunate experience of 
being president at the wrong time, analogous to

02:44.545 --> 02:55.916
Herbert Hoover, who didn't create the Depression 
but happened to come into office right before it

02:44.545 --> 02:55.916
hit. And that was the situation with Lyndon 
Johnson. I have a great deal of respect and

03:00.981 --> 03:03.864
admiration for Lyndon Johnson as a president. And 
I think he did probably as credible a job as anyone

03:04.384 --> 03:13.793
in that office at that particular time could have 
done. Now, he had to withdraw from the election. He

03:16.922 --> 03:30.300
chose to withdraw, and I think he would have lost 
the election had he run against Nixon, because

03:16.922 --> 03:30.300
people were upset with the situation and were 
going to vote for a change, period. And it didn't

03:30.861 --> 03:31.742
matter. I don't believe it mattered what the 
agenda of change would have been. They were voting

03:35.968 --> 03:41.856
for an agenda of change, period, or for change, 
period. Yes, it was very much an issue. And

03:44.149 --> 03:59.087
the Democratic Party was hurt at that particular 
time through its identity with social change,

03:44.149 --> 03:59.087
with social activism, and so forth. And the mood of 
the country was a mood of, let's get a handle on

03:59.328 --> 04:04.674
this. Let's back off. Because in every instance, 
of course, it's extreme situations which make the

04:06.980 --> 04:11.066
headlines. It's extreme situations which drew 
the attention of the national news media. And

04:15.053 --> 04:25.269
in that sense, the Johnson administration was 
characterized as having failed to maintain

04:15.053 --> 04:25.269
social control. One of the things that's 
relatively confusing about the era is how the

04:26.791 --> 04:33.662
polarization tended to group several issues 
together which were in essence unrelated. The

04:38.914 --> 04:44.513
black ghetto riots, the Vietnam War protest, The 
increase, the skyrocketing crime rate, which

04:44.830 --> 05:05.757
really took off about 1963, 1962, 1963, and it was 
precipitously climbing all during that era, all

04:44.830 --> 05:05.757
got wrapped up in this law and order issue, that 
there was a lack of respect for authority, that we

04:44.830 --> 05:05.757
need to enforce the laws, that we need to maintain 
order. And three, what in effect, were diverse

05:06.718 --> 05:13.487
issues

05:14.817 --> 05:22.507
I won't say unrelated to one another or certain 
relationships, but three distinctly different

05:14.817 --> 05:22.507
issues tended to be grouped together. And in that 
sense, people would end up

05:23.048 --> 05:40.031
voting for order, not voting against the Vietnam 
protests, not voting against the plight of black

05:23.048 --> 05:40.031
ghetto residents, but simply voting for 
maintenance of order. That's what they wanted to

05:40.091 --> 05:41.112
do. What do you think of Nixon's law and order 
campaign? I know you said he was pretty vague about

05:44.356 --> 05:46.499
it. And was it carried out after he was elected? And 
how did it have an effect, if any, on crowd control?

05:52.706 --> 06:00.136
Well, the law and order campaign, like every law 
and order campaign at the federal level, is as

05:52.706 --> 06:00.136
phony as a $3 bill. Law enforcement in this country 
is fragmented. It's certainly coordinated

06:07.838 --> 06:11.702
effort is not possible beyond the state level. And 
even at that level, extremely difficult to amount

06:12.302 --> 06:17.087
any coordinated effort. So we get president after 
president in this sense. The issue of crime

06:23.013 --> 06:25.936
control first came up the 1964 elections. Prior to 
that, one is hard pressed to find reference to

06:27.517 --> 06:35.365
crime as an issue, a national political issue. And 
we have presidents running on a law and order

06:35.986 --> 06:40.333
ticket, law and order platform. There isn't very 
much they can do to affect law and order. It's a

06:43.398 --> 06:44.419
state and local issue. Now, the one thing that was 
visibly done was the creation of the Law

06:44.519 --> 06:59.563
Enforcement Assistance Administration during 
the Johnson administration, which Nixon

06:44.519 --> 06:59.563
continued, which provided federal aid to local 
law enforcement programs for innovation and

06:59.881 --> 07:02.886
development. That aid was specifically, there 
were specific provisions which prohibited

07:03.467 --> 07:17.413
local, state and local agencies from supplanting 
endeavors that they were now supporting with

07:03.467 --> 07:17.413
state or local money. So you couldn't take the 
federal money and do something you were now doing

07:17.513 --> 07:20.799
with state money. You had to do something new with 
federal money. And that was a tremendous boon to

07:23.287 --> 07:41.838
law enforcement in this country, to develop a 
sophistication in law enforcement, to virtually

07:23.287 --> 07:41.838
catapulting, I don't think it's an overstatement 
to say, catapulting the police finally into the

07:23.287 --> 07:41.838
20th century. Whenever prior to that, very 
antiquated operations

07:50.708 --> 07:59.617
did not take advantage of either recruitment 
selection of high quality personnel or the

07:50.708 --> 07:59.617
technology that's available to them. So the Law 
Enforcement Assistance Administration, which

07:59.637 --> 08:08.125
died during the Carter administration, was 
certainly the primary factor. And we still have a

08:08.145 --> 08:09.967
residual of that, by the way. The National 
Institute of Justice still exists. And just a

08:12.530 --> 08:20.057
month ago, President Reagan signed what's now 
called the Justice Assistance Act, which will in

08:20.813 --> 08:24.399
effect, resurrect LEAA. They don't want to say 
that because... See, one of the problems with LEAA

08:24.439 --> 08:30.730
politically was that crime did not go down. A lot of 
money was pumped in. At the peak in 1973, a billion

08:32.694 --> 08:38.945
dollar appropriation to LEAA, which went to state 
and local government to help in crime control. But

08:39.345 --> 08:40.487
the crime rates didn't drop. And so the program was 
regarded as a failure. Well, it would take a long

08:46.210 --> 08:53.979
time to get off onto this tangent, but the effect of 
that sort of thing is going to take years to really

08:46.210 --> 08:53.979
be demonstrated. And federal money was dumped on a 
problem, and whenever solutions weren't

08:54.800 --> 09:04.631
forthcoming within four or five years, there was 
disillusionment set in at the federal level. That

09:05.652 --> 09:13.180
was the primary, the whole product of the riots 
which started out in the Watts section of Los

09:05.652 --> 09:13.180
Angeles with the Vietnam protests and focusing 
national attention on the police and getting the

09:13.531 --> 09:26.407
police into the CBS evening news was undoubtedly 
and unquestionably the omnibus Safe Streets and

09:13.531 --> 09:26.407
Crime Control Act. And the only measure in that act 
which made any difference at all was the federal

09:26.427 --> 09:31.913
assistance, the money that came down. The other 
provisions are empty fluff.

09:38.061 --> 09:40.804
Can you cite anything in particular of why it 
didn't work for our lawyers? on the federal

09:42.640 --> 09:43.702
assistance? Well, crime...

09:49.473 --> 09:55.024
The difference between the best case and the worst 
case in terms of what we can do with structured

09:49.473 --> 09:55.024
societal response to crime is probably not all 
that great. First of all, crime is primarily a

09:55.224 --> 09:57.649
product of social conditions. So if in the... I 
suspect that in terms of the best case... the most

10:04.628 --> 10:12.439
effective, most efficient criminal justice 
system response possible probably makes no more

10:04.628 --> 10:12.439
than a 20% difference in the crime rate. Now, it 
took time. When that money first came down, you

10:16.685 --> 10:21.071
literally didn't know what to do with it. I was on 
the Law Enforcement Training Council during that

10:21.151 --> 10:30.163
period of time when the money really started 
flowing, 1971.

10:30.751 --> 10:31.792
We had representatives. It was dispersed to all 
the states, and then the state could disperse

10:31.832 --> 10:34.596
within. It was a block grant program, it was 
called. So the state would get a block grant, $20

10:37.700 --> 10:47.353
million, and then the state would disperse it to 
local agencies within that state, and it would be a

10:37.700 --> 10:47.353
state agency that was responsible for that. 
Representatives of the state agency came out and

10:48.114 --> 10:53.321
visited the Law Enforcement Training Council and 
said, come up with something. Give us some

10:53.361 --> 10:54.622
training programs. We've got about $300,000 here 
that we need to spend, and we're just going to go

10:54.843 --> 11:00.370
back. And so we literally invented training 
programs, quick and dirty, to get the money out. It

11:07.992 --> 11:10.617
took time to develop the sophistication. It took 
time. You didn't have in law enforcement anybody

11:11.658 --> 11:16.707
with college degrees at that time. When I went on 
the Lansing Police Department in 1967 with a

11:17.008 --> 11:25.362
baccalaureate degree, I was the first individual 
ever to go on that department, a $200 million

11:17.008 --> 11:25.362
department that had a college degree. And in fact, 
you didn't tell anybody about it. You kept quiet

11:28.855 --> 11:29.916
about it. And so you just simply didn't have the 
sophistication. You didn't have the

11:32.901 --> 11:36.225
infrastructure in place to spend the money 
effectively. About the time that the money dried

11:36.846 --> 11:42.114
up, the Carter administration, we finally were in 
a position to spend it well. And I suspect if the

11:42.795 --> 11:52.309
money starts flowing again in substantial 
amounts through the new Justice Assistance Act,

11:42.795 --> 11:52.309
we'll do a much better job of spending it this time 
than what we did the last time. OK. We've already

11:54.890 --> 11:57.854
talked a little bit about the tough position the 
policemen are in. What were the police force's

11:57.954 --> 12:04.023
feelings during the 60s towards being ostracized 
for alleged brutality and breakout riots? And did

12:04.764 --> 12:08.690
these feelings have an effect on their 
performance? Yes. Police officers were very

12:09.972 --> 12:15.079
resentful of the hostility that was generated 
against them. They truly felt like that they had

12:15.099 --> 12:20.948
behaved in a very reserved way. which in the vast 
majority of instances did occur. They

12:24.059 --> 12:29.805
felt like they were being made scapegoats.

12:34.149 --> 12:44.279
They felt like they were doing a basic duty in terms 
of maintenance of order and were being criticized

12:34.149 --> 12:44.279
for that. And it had an effect on performance. It 
had an effect both in terms of your reaction a riot

12:50.240 --> 12:52.985
line and in your daily contact with citizens. I 
think that was an era which was very unpleasant in a

12:53.125 --> 13:02.503
sense of police feelings of hostility towards the 
community. You'd see that, you'd stop someone on a

13:04.166 --> 13:13.564
traffic stop who had hair below their ears, and 
boy,

13:14.067 --> 13:18.933
Unpleasant exchanges may not have been 
inevitable, but occurred at a high percentage of

13:14.067 --> 13:18.933
the time. And the police certainly instigated 
much of that. Walk up and say, OK, dirtbag, give me

13:25.260 --> 13:28.684
your driver's license. You're not going to have a 
pleasant contact after that. And so that

13:32.369 --> 13:42.741
resentment was manifested both in riot 
situations and in daily contacts. A lot of ill

13:43.632 --> 13:46.035
feelings at that particular time. How did these 
feelings affect the performance when they went

13:46.836 --> 13:49.880
into the situation? Were they less hesitant to 
bring out force? Yes, I think they were less

13:53.925 --> 13:56.008
hesitant to bring out force. They made many 
unnecessary arrests.

14:00.915 --> 14:06.402
They generated hostility where none necessarily 
had been generated.

14:10.127 --> 14:11.108
We have... strong commitment to a civilian police 
system in this country. I believe very, very

14:18.712 --> 14:29.788
strongly in making a civilian police system and 
recognize that on a worldwide basis, a number of

14:18.712 --> 14:29.788
police agencies are not civilian in the sense that 
we think of it as civilian. very closely aligned to

14:30.410 --> 14:32.295
military. Even in some other democracies, they 
are very closely aligned to military and, in fact,

14:33.238 --> 14:45.533
train with military and interchange, in some 
cases, interchange in terms of officer corps and

14:33.238 --> 14:45.533
the like.

14:47.386 --> 14:52.872
The problem with the disturbances during that era 
is it militarized the police. It put them in a role

14:52.932 --> 14:55.956
of a military force rather than a civilian force. 
And the police are not prepared to deal with that.

15:01.922 --> 15:03.204
That's a good way to put it. They're just not 
prepared to deal with that. Police in the United

15:05.566 --> 15:10.332
States are, in effect, civilians in uniform. And 
as long as you maintain that, that both legal and

15:13.930 --> 15:17.618
psychological approach to the job, you'll do 
well. When you start thinking of yourself as an

15:18.801 --> 15:32.192
occupying military force, as the police were in 
the black ghettos during that period of time, in

15:18.801 --> 15:32.192
situations in St. Louis, in Los Angeles, even in 
Detroit, where They wouldn't respond to a call, a

15:32.408 --> 15:40.236
domestic dispute, in certain areas, certain 
blocks, without sending four officers. So you

15:40.276 --> 15:44.460
send four officers in on a husband-wife dispute 
where you've got to call a referee. Well, you show

15:45.101 --> 15:57.994
up with four individuals, and yet the character of 
that situation is going to change immediately

15:45.101 --> 15:57.994
into a confrontation, hostile situation, just by 
the nature of you walking the door with four guys

15:45.101 --> 15:57.994
facing some husband who's having a, and he's maybe 
half drunk, usually is, but having a dispute with

15:58.244 --> 16:12.311
his wife, and you're not going to sit down and do 
social counseling and mediation with four

15:58.244 --> 16:12.311
officers there. Okay. Is riot control, I'm trying 
to get what you think about it, is riot control a

16:15.157 --> 16:21.028
police force's job, military, or both? well it 
should first be the police force's job despite

16:22.628 --> 16:49.598
this may sound contradictory despite everything 
i've said about the police are basically

16:22.628 --> 16:49.598
civilians the police basically are untrained or 
unprepared to deal with with riots we have in fact

16:22.628 --> 16:49.598
an absolutely outstanding record in the united 
states the police dealing with riots from the

16:22.628 --> 16:49.598
perspective of civilians not getting hurt and by 
and large the police have managed to control civil

16:22.628 --> 16:49.598
disturbance in this country without hurting 
civilians i think that's part of Despite the

16:50.067 --> 17:01.457
ineptitude, despite the lack of equipment, 
despite their own psychological, their own fear

16:50.067 --> 17:01.457
in those situations, the police, by and large, 
have behaved as civilians. And the few instances

17:02.119 --> 17:06.270
we've brought military in have not gone well. The 
amount of force used is typically far more than is

17:09.203 --> 17:12.767
necessary. Realize the police have to walk back to 
that neighborhood the next day. They've got to

17:15.811 --> 17:17.593
deal with those people on a one-to-one basis. And 
they are much more hesitant to club somebody over

17:18.193 --> 17:25.342
the head or to shoot at somebody because the next 
day they could be shooting back at them. And

17:25.362 --> 17:28.465
they're going to use a whole lot more restraint. 
No, I think the police, you only call in the

17:28.486 --> 17:36.595
military when it's virtually totally out of 
control and the civilian police are no longer able

17:28.486 --> 17:36.595
to handle it at all And that would be absolutely a 
last resort, including the National Guard, by the

17:37.064 --> 17:44.592
way, which is probably the worst to call in of 
anybody. Okay. When you say they, in the past, have

17:46.714 --> 17:51.418
a really good history, that's comparing it to 
other countries? Yes, right. That's in, yeah,

17:52.600 --> 18:04.031
it's in contrast to even other democracies where 
the police have reacted with much greater force

17:52.600 --> 18:04.031
and there have been many more, much more extensive 
injuries ensued. Okay. What a, What impact over

18:06.089 --> 18:08.492
the 60s was media? Well, there's no doubt that 
media coverage of these events escalates the

18:10.154 --> 18:18.224
violence, escalates the disturbances. I'm not 
proposing news blackouts, but certainly it is

18:19.266 --> 18:35.286
helpful to have voluntary restraint on the part of 
the media in coverage of certain of these events. a

18:35.823 --> 18:49.337
minor disturbance at a city park can become a 
neighborhood-wide riot if the cameras are

18:35.823 --> 18:49.337
immediately there and if you're broadcasting it 
on the evening news and so forth. I think that

18:49.458 --> 19:01.611
what's necessary is restraint on the part of the 
media whenever disturbances are still in

18:49.458 --> 19:01.611
progress. Now, once...

19:05.472 --> 19:12.879
Once they've subsided, then certainly the media 
can, I wouldn't propose for a minute that we don't

19:05.472 --> 19:12.879
provide full coverage. But I do believe it's wise 
to maintain some restraint while things are in

19:13.319 --> 19:18.724
progress. It does incite. It does draw 
individuals, more individuals, into the

19:20.365 --> 19:24.949
situation. And also, do cameras have a strong 
effect on how brutal the police are going to be when

19:25.710 --> 19:33.657
they know that there's a camera right there? No, I 
don't believe the cameras have a mitigating

19:34.295 --> 19:39.825
effect on police brutality. No.

19:44.674 --> 19:55.073
The psychology of that situation, by the time an 
officer loses control and starts wailing with a

19:44.674 --> 19:55.073
nightstick, it doesn't matter if you've got 50 TV 
cameras focused in on that officer. He is... the

19:56.772 --> 19:59.476
kind of instigation, the kind of fear that's beget 
that. In his mind, he is being justified in what

19:59.816 --> 20:07.608
he's doing, and therefore the fact that you're 
taping it isn't making any difference. It's not a

20:07.648 --> 20:12.515
situation where he's trying to commit a deviant 
act that he knows he'll be sanctioned for. From the

20:14.077 --> 20:17.242
perspective of that officer, he's justified in 
doing what he's doing. Okay. Why did Hubert

20:19.285 --> 20:23.350
Humphrey order an FBI inquiry on the Battle of 
Chicago? Well... And what came about that

20:27.232 --> 20:31.037
inquiry? I don't recall the precise results of 
that inquiry. Certainly no one that I recall was

20:33.340 --> 20:41.249
ever sanctioned in the city of Chicago for 
anything they did during the Democratic

20:33.340 --> 20:41.249
Convention riots. Not one officer. I

20:45.034 --> 20:56.428
would defend the actions of the Chicago police as 
human beings. I would not defend their actions as

20:58.028 --> 21:03.219
an organizational entity, as a unit of 
government. In that sense, Humphrey's call for an

21:03.239 --> 21:18.450
inquiry was undoubtedly justified to the extent 
that such inquiry investigates

21:18.987 --> 21:23.472
the appropriateness of organizational 
response, which was needed. Realize you had Mayor

21:23.712 --> 21:26.435
Daley in Chicago at the time. And Daley was a 
classic law and order and had made comments in the

21:26.555 --> 21:36.545
months prior to that during some of the ghetto 
disturbances in Chicago. And this is where you get

21:36.565 --> 21:39.007
this bleeding of one incident into another. 
During the ghetto disturbances in Chicago, he had

21:39.027 --> 21:44.573
made a public comment on television I want my 
officers to shoot to kill arsonists and shoot to

21:45.143 --> 21:49.789
maim looters. Well, looters are, for God's sakes, 
I don't want to sound sexist, but women and

21:50.790 --> 21:59.741
children out there looting. There's an 
excellent, Joseph Lombard's book, The New

21:59.761 --> 22:13.918
Centurions, has a chapter or two devoted to, which 
is quasi-autobiographical, by the way, has a

21:59.761 --> 22:13.918
chapter or two devoted to the Watts Riot. And 
there's an excellent scenario where a young

22:16.127 --> 22:30.863
sergeant ends up taking control of a platoon of 
seven or eight individuals, and there's a

22:16.127 --> 22:30.863
warehouse, and there's individuals in the 
warehouse, and he gets caught up in the role, and he

22:16.127 --> 22:30.863
surrounds the warehouse, and he orders them to 
surrender over the bullhorn, and then they come

22:16.127 --> 22:30.863
parading out. And I can't quote it exactly, but 
Wambaugh does a number in terms of, the first one

22:30.883 --> 22:43.397
out was an old man with a strong limp and an old 
battered trench coat. The second was a a

22:44.847 --> 22:49.334
middle-aged woman who weighed over 250 pounds, 
and a third one. And he goes on like that until you

22:49.354 --> 22:59.691
get these looters,

22:49.354 --> 22:59.691
these rebels. I'm trying to look for the right word 
here. uh instigators of rebellion and and so forth

23:02.752 --> 23:18.094
and what what of course the the scenario is uh he's 
got his military strike force there and he's got a

23:02.752 --> 23:18.094
pathetic lot of people uh that he's surrounded in 
order to come out with their hands up and uh As the

23:18.766 --> 23:22.511
scenario goes in the chapter, the sergeant shakes 
his head and walks away. The officers are left

23:22.551 --> 23:26.436
standing there wondering what to do. They stand 
around for about five minutes, and they all walk

23:27.117 --> 23:30.481
away, and the looters walk away. I cite that to you 
because it's a

23:30.982 --> 23:45.280
telling situation in terms of what you have.

23:49.360 --> 23:53.645
We have never been so polarized in this country 
that we didn't identify with one another.

23:57.269 --> 24:17.072
I read in the U.S. News report, U.S. News and World 
Report back in 1964, that the Army's approach to

23:57.269 --> 24:17.072
crowd control was to first show force, second, ask 
rioters to disperse, three, be in the crowd to

23:57.269 --> 24:17.072
disperse, four, use high-pressure water hoses, 
five, use tear gas, six, fire at leaders, and then

23:57.269 --> 24:17.072
seven, fire at everybody else. What do you think 
about this approach, and has it changed? And if it

24:20.536 --> 24:26.704
has changed, what are the reasons for change?

24:28.907 --> 24:37.518
First of all, the assumption is when you start with 
a show of force, the assumption in terms of general

24:28.907 --> 24:37.518
operating procedures is that you already have a 
crowd which is considered out of control. So

24:38.259 --> 24:44.808
preceding that, what you generally have is 
minimum show of force as long as the crowd is

24:38.259 --> 24:44.808
peaceful. You don't want to instigate them. In 
terms of that sequence, once a crowd is out of

24:47.005 --> 24:53.134
control, I don't think it's changed. That 
primarily is the technique that's recommended.

24:59.844 --> 25:07.015
The only thing I'm not quite sure of, and I don't 
think you'll find in any police department

24:59.844 --> 25:07.015
training manual, is the shooting at. You're only 
going to return fire, particularly when dealing

25:08.517 --> 25:15.207
with a crowd. The only variant of that would be that 
rather than shooting leaders, arresting leaders

25:15.642 --> 25:30.035
is generally regarded as a good tactic to go in and 
attempt to arrest the leaders early on if the other

25:15.642 --> 25:30.035
tactics don't work. I also read where a mayor 
advocated a permanence to stop riots, and it

25:32.717 --> 25:38.702
worked for him. He was quoted as saying, meet force 
with superior force from the outset. to warn

25:44.701 --> 25:46.464
people, no mercy on the lawless. Do you think it 
just takes a certain kind of crowd for this to work?

25:49.931 --> 25:53.177
Or do you think this, do you totally disagree with 
this? I simply disagree with it. Gentlemen, no

25:55.080 --> 25:56.543
mercy on the lawless. Those kind of statements are

25:56.563 --> 26:06.962
good, classic situation of law and order 
rhetoric. that out on the street doesn't get

26:07.313 --> 26:09.015
translated. It just loses translation out on the 
street. You've got the classic picture, the

26:11.559 --> 26:23.376
photograph that made all the papers in the late 
1960s during the Newark riots of the police

26:11.559 --> 26:23.376
officer in Newark bearing down with a shotgun. You 
don't see what he's shooting at, but the

26:23.397 --> 26:28.985
commentary was he shot and killed a 12-year-old 
boy running from a liquor store. That's, you know,

26:31.168 --> 26:36.055
no mercy for the lawless. We have never had justice 
without mercy. We've always had mercy and

26:38.947 --> 26:40.349
justice. I just disagree totally with that. I 
think that the business of showing force is fine,

26:43.013 --> 26:53.029
the business of enforcing the law within the 
limits of what you're able to do out and out, the

26:43.013 --> 26:53.029
turmoil of a riot situation. And there are real 
limits to that. I don't know. How much good do you do

26:57.255 --> 27:02.143
by arresting somebody running away from the store 
with a gun? A woman who lives in a black ghetto

27:02.596 --> 27:10.126
running in, grabbing some dresses, running away 
to the store, and so you'd effect an arrest. And

27:10.146 --> 27:17.635
during the setting of a ghetto riot, whenever 
everybody's looting or TVs are being carried

27:10.146 --> 27:17.635
away, I don't know that you accomplish a thing. 
Were there some changes in technique and

27:19.878 --> 27:23.723
equipment that made the riot situations more 
violent? And about when were these changes made?

27:30.187 --> 27:34.271
I don't recall any changes that I would 
characterize as making pariah situations more

27:30.187 --> 27:34.271
violent. And as a point in fact, I think if changes 
were made, they'd probably decrease the amount of

27:34.291 --> 27:39.056
violence, not aggravated it. Do you recall any 
that made them less violent?

27:46.303 --> 27:57.915
I think to

27:46.303 --> 27:57.915
the extent that the police were prepared to deal 
with, had some sort of a backup in terms of use of

27:46.303 --> 27:57.915
force, the bird shot as a case in point, for 
example, I think that the police were more

27:58.098 --> 28:02.404
confident. The police were less afraid that they 
would have to use deadly force and therefore have

28:03.725 --> 28:09.673
deadly force used on them. Certainly in terms of 
the distribution of walkie-talkies, believe it

28:12.317 --> 28:21.449
or not, to each officer, which were just being 
distributed at that time. Now, in a ghetto

28:21.529 --> 28:26.215
situation, that's very important to you because 
you're in communication with police with other

28:26.920 --> 28:55.493
officers and therefore again you're less afraid 
you're less likely to start shooting in a

28:26.920 --> 28:55.493
situation where you feel threatened those things 
more than more than gas grenades or pepper foggers

28:26.920 --> 28:55.493
or that sort of thing really those those items were 
used relatively seldom

28:26.920 --> 28:55.493
professor joseph layman of cal berkeley said in a 
democratic society the police must be concerned

28:26.920 --> 28:55.493
with what with doing what is most consistent with 
the least amount of force. How do you feel about

28:59.457 --> 29:02.823
this statement? Yes, I would agree with that.

29:07.752 --> 29:10.637
We never enforce all the law all the time. And

29:11.659 --> 29:19.894
that simply carries through to a riot situation. 
In a riotous situation, it doesn't always pay to

29:20.785 --> 29:26.133
make an arrest, even if you see a violation. You use 
the least amount of force to affect control, to

29:26.193 --> 29:29.618
maintain order. The law is not an end in and of 
itself. It's a means to an end. The end is

29:33.544 --> 29:34.765
maintaining order. And enforcement of the law is 
the best means. In one situation, fine, but in

29:37.269 --> 29:40.294
other situations, it may not be. And that's 
certainly true in riot or disturbance

29:40.694 --> 29:43.478
situations. How much of a part did police dogs play 
in the change over the decades? Not very much. I

29:53.244 --> 29:59.512
don't recall a dog being used in the state of 
Michigan during any of the disturbances. And my

29:59.913 --> 30:06.021
memory just is not good enough to tell you whether 
they may have been used in disturbances

29:59.913 --> 30:06.021
elsewhere. The image of the dogs being used in 
Birmingham, Alabama during the civil rights

30:06.061 --> 30:15.514
demonstrations

30:06.061 --> 30:15.514
had an enormous impact. police were in fact many 
departments simply have policies that forbid

30:16.118 --> 30:43.948
even dog even departments that have dogs have 
policies that forbid they're using them in crowd

30:16.118 --> 30:43.948
control situations because they are so 
inflammatory and I were I a police chief I would

30:16.118 --> 30:43.948
absolutely forbid a dog from being used in a crowd 
control situation no no reason for yes

30:16.118 --> 30:43.948
right and at that in fact that era Steve had really 
hurt what is otherwise an effective law

30:44.705 --> 30:50.012
enforcement tool, the use of dogs. And we're still 
recoiling from that era whenever dogs were used

30:50.613 --> 30:57.662
for riot control in Birmingham and probably 
elsewhere. I don't remember. I remember

30:58.283 --> 31:00.866
specifically Birmingham, Alabama. And that 
generated such hostility, such resentment

31:01.607 --> 31:13.023
towards police dogs that many agencies don't have 
them yet that should have them for purposes of

31:01.607 --> 31:13.023
tracking, for purposes of going in a building. We 
have a burglar hiding. And locating the burglar,

31:14.455 --> 31:17.660
it's a lot safer for the officers. It's a lot safer 
for the burglar, in a sense. He doesn't get a

31:20.024 --> 31:23.549
trigger-happy officer blowing him away, then he 
sees a shadow. But departments are hesitant to

31:24.210 --> 31:30.040
have dogs because of that riot control imagery of 
dogs. When was that taking place? And when did the

31:31.642 --> 31:36.109
dogs were? That was early, early 60s. Yeah, those 
civil rights demonstrations were early 60s,

31:37.952 --> 31:42.319
particularly in Birmingham. And by the time you 
had the full-scale late 60s disturbances, I don't

31:42.839 --> 31:51.089
recall dogs being used. OK.

31:52.270 --> 32:00.601
You've already touched on a few of the techniques, 
the equipment for crowd control. With the

32:00.941 --> 32:11.614
increased government spending on research for 
crowd control devices, such as a bubbly machine,

32:00.941 --> 32:11.614
an instant banana peel, rubber bullet, 
die-bearing dart, Were they used and were they

32:12.134 --> 32:15.918
effective? They weren't used in the late 60s. I 
think most of that technology is post-1970

32:18.541 --> 32:27.271
technology, and so by and large were not used in the 
1960s. And I have

32:27.531 --> 32:34.699
reservations about how effective any of it will 
be. You've got to have it at the right place at

32:34.915 --> 32:42.014
exactly the right time, and it's very difficult in 
some cases to do that. I've gotten it out of an

32:42.936 --> 32:47.288
article dated in 67, but I guess that was just 
enough. Maybe the testing stages. Well, I stand

32:48.857 --> 32:50.218
corrected then. They may have had them. I just 
don't recall them being available to any agency. I

32:54.965 --> 33:01.673
was on the Law Enforcement Training Council, as 
you recall, in 1971, and we developed the training

32:54.965 --> 33:01.673
modules for civil disturbances then. And I don't 
remember an agency in the state of Michigan that

33:02.234 --> 33:05.779
had any of those devices. Again, they may have, and 
I just wasn't aware of it, but they certainly

33:05.819 --> 33:11.546
weren't widespread use. So these newfangled 
devices didn't change any technique or anything?

33:15.592 --> 33:15.652
No. They weren't even used? No. Could you please 
compare the differences in controlling a crowd in

33:19.600 --> 33:24.307
64 and more than 74? If there are any differences. I 
know you mentioned that psychology was one of the

33:26.350 --> 33:32.519
biggest changes over the 60s, whereas technique 
wasn't quite as much. I think we learned, I think

33:33.120 --> 33:41.011
that decade taught the police to act with 
reservation, no matter what the provocation.

33:41.311 --> 33:42.753
That's the primary thing we learned. Now, even 
given that, You had a situation in Austin in the

33:46.060 --> 33:52.147
last 12 months where you had officers getting 
carried away and whaling with the nightsticks.

33:52.167 --> 34:03.820
But the difference there is that the minute the 
subject was subdued, the nightsticks quit

33:52.167 --> 34:03.820
flying, and it did not spread. The anger did not 
spread among other officers to the point where you

34:03.960 --> 34:11.789
had 40 or 50 nightsticks whaling. The primary 
issue was learning the lesson that you're not

34:15.710 --> 34:18.713
going to win by clubbing somebody in the head. 
You're going to lose. The media's going to rack

34:20.395 --> 34:21.577
you. You're going to be criticized. The police 
chief's going to lose his job. That you're going to

34:26.583 --> 34:27.484
lose. Out on that situation, I don't care what the 
provocation, you hold your temper. Now, that's

34:31.208 --> 34:32.710
the lesson that was really learned. And the 
equipment and the formations and the techniques

34:32.730 --> 34:37.815
are all secondary to that.

34:40.859 --> 34:40.959
Okay. A hypothetical situation today and now, say 
you were chief of police and... there was a crowd,

34:45.477 --> 34:52.229
potential riot situation, what would your plan of 
action be? Well, I think first of all to have a

34:52.249 --> 34:59.842
minimum show of force until it was inevitable that 
violence was going to occur. When violence

35:00.904 --> 35:09.038
occurred, then move out in force and immediately 
arrest the leaders, the agitators of the crowd,

35:00.904 --> 35:09.038
remove them from the scene. Don't make mass 
arrests, if you can avoid it at all. Don't make mass

35:12.963 --> 35:14.145
arrests. Go in and grab four or five. And then 
attempt to split that crowd into small groups. Mob

35:21.517 --> 35:23.140
psychology is very real. People in that large 
group and the anonymity that comes from being in

35:23.541 --> 35:26.706
that large group. people really do behave 
differently than what they will as individuals.

35:31.340 --> 35:37.528
To the extent that you can get them in small groups, 
to the extent that you can get them isolated,

35:31.340 --> 35:37.528
they'll start behaving as individuals again. And 
that's the primary tactic to be used. Probably the

35:42.514 --> 35:51.466
last question would be, I know crowd control 
riots, like you said, are a big issue now because

35:42.514 --> 35:51.466
there are very few of them. How much research for 
crowd control is going on today and what do you see

35:51.486 --> 35:56.372
in the future? I'm not aware of any research going 
on in crowd control right now. There's certainly

36:02.322 --> 36:09.957
not in terms of, in general in police circles, any 
research going on in crowd control.

36:12.198 --> 36:16.523
We have, relatively speaking, very effective 
agents for fraud control right now. The banana

36:18.345 --> 36:27.115
peel of the types of agents and so forth are fine, 
but good old CS Gas has always done it for us. You hit

36:29.037 --> 36:34.763
someone with a crab with a pepper fogger, and 
they're going to move.

36:35.924 --> 36:42.277
in terms of controlling the crowd, other than 
dealing with the psychology of crowd control,

36:35.924 --> 36:42.277
equipment is not the answer. And we know, in terms 
of the approach to crowds, what the best police

36:43.660 --> 36:50.454
psychological approach is. When we get to 
equipment, then if you're going to have to

36:55.043 --> 37:02.219
disperse that crowd of equipment, you gas them, 
pure and simple. And it's highly effective. It

37:03.743 --> 37:04.204
works. They're going to move. They're going to 
run. And when they start running, you split. You

37:07.812 --> 37:08.714
divide them. You plan ahead of time so that the... 
either with wedges of officers or by the natural

37:12.695 --> 37:20.765
configuration of the area or whatever, to start 
splitting that crowd into smaller groups. And

37:20.805 --> 37:22.787
when you do that, you'll get control of it again. 
It's only in a large mob that things really get out

37:22.847 --> 37:26.772
of control. And I don't foresee any extensive 
amount of attention being paid to this. I don't

37:33.580 --> 37:42.010
know if you've ever experienced being hit with 
tear gas or not, but one time around, it makes a

37:33.580 --> 37:42.010
believer out of you. That stuff stings, your eyes, 
you no longer can see, your eyes are watering so bad

37:42.884 --> 37:56.600
you can't see, you choke, you gag, and you don't sit 
there next to a gas bomb and look at it. You move

37:56.620 --> 37:58.162
whenever it hits. That's very effective. No 
long-term injuries result from that.

38:06.592 --> 38:10.377
I know it has a bad reputation, but after all, at 
that point you're talking about We're talking

38:11.032 --> 38:13.775
about trying to use force, which isn't going to 
maim or kill. And that is effective. Is there any

38:17.018 --> 38:26.408
other comments you'd like to add about the 
questions or anything about

38:17.018 --> 38:26.408
this interview? Do you feel we got a full one? I 
think we did a pretty reasonable job. You did a very

38:30.212 --> 38:31.854
thorough job in the interview. My compliments to 
you in terms of covering the issues that exist with

38:32.094 --> 38:39.402
regard to the problem.

38:40.799 --> 38:49.748
I would just, I would add something as just a matter 
of underscoring that I've already said, and that

38:40.799 --> 38:49.748
is that the primary dynamic is police fear. And if 
you can prevent the police, to the extent, you

38:49.928 --> 39:01.120
can't prevent the police from being afraid, but to 
the extent you can give police confidence, you'll

38:49.928 --> 39:01.120
maintain structured, reasoned response to crowd 
control. When the police are, when the police go

39:01.140 --> 39:05.144
out of control is when the police fear is out of 
control. I don't think the Chicago police on that

39:05.684 --> 39:09.388
Wednesday night in Chicago rioted because they 
hated the demonstrators. I think they rioted

39:12.909 --> 39:16.654
because they were afraid for their personal 
safety and for the safety of their families. And

39:17.055 --> 39:18.537
they were going to strike out at somebody. They 
were going to show who was in charge. A very

39:21.080 --> 39:29.152
effective technique for a group that wants to form 
a rebellion in this country is to personalize the

39:21.080 --> 39:29.152
police. Start calling them at home. Start leaving 
something in their mailbox on their doorstep. And

39:34.239 --> 39:38.785
I'll guarantee you, you will get a violent police 
reaction when you do that. Yes, that's a lot of

39:42.876 --> 39:45.644
wine. Thank you very much, Dr. Hoover. No problem, 
Steve. You really did do a good job.
