00:01.752 --> 00:08.141
November 17th, 1989, Matt Spahn is interviewing 
me for a journalism project. How did that go?

00:15.251 --> 00:19.457
This is an interview with Judith A. Baer by Matt W. 
Spahn. on November 17, 1989, at Bolton Hall, Texas

00:19.572 --> 00:27.067
A&M University, concerning feminism. In the 
interest of accumulating knowledge, I am asking

00:28.049 --> 00:36.186
you to donate this tape to me or to the Texas A&M Oral 
History Collection in the University Archives.

00:36.707 --> 00:37.549
Is that all right with you? Right. Let's begin. 
Tell me about yourself. Okay. I was born in Mount

00:44.215 --> 00:56.532
Kisco, New York, while my father was at Wright 
Field in Dayton, Ohio, during World War II, and my

00:44.215 --> 00:56.532
mother was visiting her family. When the war 
ended, we moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts,

00:57.814 --> 01:03.422
where my father got a PhD at Harvard. I like to 
describe myself as a second-generation

01:03.462 --> 01:07.888
political scientist. We lived in Cambridge until 
I was 14, then we moved to Arlington, which is near

01:07.868 --> 01:15.717
Cambridge, where I went to high school. I then went 
to Bryn Mawr College, got an AB there in 1968, got my

01:16.318 --> 01:30.214
MA from the University of Chicago in Political 
Science in 71, and my PhD in 1974. And after a long

01:30.194 --> 01:38.697
series of cross-country moves, trials and 
tribulations, I am an associate professor of

01:30.194 --> 01:38.697
political science at Texas A&M. Thank you. Let's 
start off your early childhood because we want to

01:41.618 --> 01:46.303
see how this has led up to you. There is a profile of 
the professional woman which has her as either the

01:46.323 --> 02:04.441
oldest child of daughters only or the only child of 
someone who is very close to and influenced by her

01:46.323 --> 02:04.441
father and grows up in a non-traditional family. 
That is not me. I am the oldest, and I have three

02:06.543 --> 02:17.156
younger brothers, no sisters, and we grew up in a 
family which was extremely traditional with

02:06.543 --> 02:17.156
respect to sex roles. And I have always said to 
people that I've been a feminist ever since I can

02:18.137 --> 02:23.283
remember. When I was eight years old, I decided I 
wanted to be the first woman president. You've got

02:28.129 --> 02:29.931
to remember this is back in the 1950s. The 1950s 
were not a great decade for feminism. He was high

02:36.293 --> 02:39.596
school, and by that time it was the 1960s. I 
remember high school as the worst four years of my

02:39.856 --> 02:46.362
life so far anyway. And things only got better when 
I went to college. I went to college planning to

02:50.886 --> 02:58.173
become a lawyer, maybe possibly the first woman 
Supreme Court Justice, which it's already too

02:50.886 --> 02:58.173
late for. And in my junior year, I met a great 
teacher, Peter Bachrach at Bryn Mawr College, and

02:58.213 --> 03:05.980
it was partly his influence. that made me want to go 
into graduate school in political science. And

03:09.824 --> 03:12.687
then I went to the University of Chicago. And about 
that time, and this is the late 1960s, the feminist

03:13.088 --> 03:22.438
movement, the newer wave of the feminist movement 
came along. And I just wish it had happened 20 years

03:22.919 --> 03:34.752
earlier, but I really believe that if I'd been born 
in the 1920s or 30s instead of the 1940s, I would

03:22.919 --> 03:34.752
have gone absolutely crazy. So it was very 
fortunate the feminist movement came along when

03:34.732 --> 03:38.800
it did. You said the new wave in the late 60s. When 
was the very first wave? The very first feminist

03:44.771 --> 03:56.132
movement in this country is usually seen as having 
begun in 1848 with the convention at Seneca Falls,

03:44.771 --> 03:56.132
New York. Well, there had been, okay, the first 
American woman to write about feminism was Judith

03:56.112 --> 04:06.772
Sergeant Murray, and her book on the equality of 
the sexes was published in 1790. It wasn't very

04:06.953 --> 04:09.858
influential at the time. She was influenced by the 
great British 18th century feminist Mary

04:09.918 --> 04:15.589
Wollstonecraft. The women who convened at Seneca 
Falls, and prominent among them were Susan B.

04:15.890 --> 04:24.521
Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Lucretia 
Mott. Most of them came out of the abolitionist

04:25.362 --> 04:30.268
movement, the movement to abolish slavery. There 
had been, in the earlier 1840s, a large

04:30.829 --> 04:38.438
anti-slavery convention in London. And Stanton 
and Mott, who were present, were not allowed to

04:38.418 --> 04:50.555
speak because it was considered unseemly for 
women to speak in public, and they decided it

04:38.418 --> 04:50.555
wasn't only the slaves that needed liberating. 
There's a real parallel with the later feminist

04:50.996 --> 05:02.552
movement because most of us had been involved in 
the civil rights movement and also in the student

04:50.996 --> 05:02.552
and anti-war movement of the 60s. But there's a 
Seneca Falls Declaration, and it's modeled after

05:03.173 --> 05:13.809
the Declaration of Independence, where they talk 
about histories of injuries and usurpations. And

05:14.951 --> 05:28.692
they mention such things as the practice then of 
giving custody of children to the father in

05:14.951 --> 05:28.692
divorce, the practice of coverture, which meant 
that when a man and woman were married, The notion

05:28.958 --> 05:34.612
was the couple was one, and that one was the 
husband. The woman could not sign contracts. She

05:36.777 --> 05:38.121
could not own property. She had no separate 
identity. And, of course, the denial of the vote.

05:45.158 --> 06:02.222
Getting the laws of the different states amended 
so that women could vote and getting a national

05:45.158 --> 06:02.222
constitutional amendment was the goal of the 
first feminist movement and that of course

05:45.158 --> 06:02.222
culminated in 1920 with the passage of the 19th 
amendment. And after that, the movement kind of

06:02.202 --> 06:07.667
fizzled out because that had been the goal. All the 
energies had gone toward that goal. The earliest

06:11.211 --> 06:15.795
generation of feminists, Anthony and Stanton, 
were dead by now. And there just was really not that

06:16.516 --> 06:18.858
much energy. Now, yeah, go ahead. You talked about 
the movement in the late 60s and how it was part of

06:21.981 --> 06:28.547
the student movement, the anti-war movement. 
What peoples did that movement share with the

06:29.000 --> 06:33.087
other movements? Was there a completely 
different group? Was there some overlaying? No,

06:35.892 --> 06:40.319
there was a considerable amount of overlap. Jo 
Freeman, who's published quite a bit, who's the

06:40.960 --> 06:47.872
name she published under in the late 60s, was 
Joreen. We were graduate students together at the

06:47.952 --> 06:51.598
University of Chicago, and she was... a veteran of 
that movement. People like Casey Hayden, Tom

06:54.242 --> 06:57.688
Hayden's first wife. But there were others who, 
well, like me, I was never prominent in the civil

06:58.750 --> 07:05.501
rights movement. I marched and I carried banners 
and I licked stamps and I put posters up all over

07:05.581 --> 07:11.592
town. Carnation can milk, by the way, is very good 
if you want to make posters stick to trees. Most

07:17.802 --> 07:21.647
people don't know that, even though it's messy. 
And I was really, because I really concentrated on

07:23.169 --> 07:38.991
school when I was in college, and I was much too shy 
to take a prominent role, and I'm not one of the

07:23.169 --> 07:38.991
world's best-known feminists either, but I'm a 
little more prominent in that movement. And one of

07:39.912 --> 07:44.839
the things that happened that got the feminist 
movement going was the publication in 1963 of The

07:44.819 --> 07:50.106
Feminine Mystique by Betty Friedan. And Betty 
Friedan was a woman who had gone to graduate school

07:50.126 --> 08:01.800
in the 1940s, dropped out to be a housewife, 
married, had three kids, and then really became a

07:50.126 --> 08:01.800
journalist and looked around for projects. And 
the 1960s, well, that was still the time when Leave

08:02.080 --> 08:09.830
It, I don't know if you've ever seen Leave It to 
Beaver, you know, all those comedies, Father

08:02.080 --> 08:09.830
Knows Best. That was the model, the very 
patriarchal family. and you were not that

08:14.789 --> 08:35.447
everybody lived that way but you were expected to 
and all of a sudden for dan was saying hey being a

08:14.789 --> 08:35.447
housewife is not right for every woman it's a it's a 
good idea to be a lawyer to have careers to go to

08:14.789 --> 08:35.447
graduate school we have really narrowed the 
possibilities for women. And of course, she was

08:38.118 --> 08:41.664
widely thought of as being absolutely crazy. And 
abuse was just heaped on her. And when I read this

08:44.349 --> 08:47.455
book, I was a freshman in college. And in fact, it 
was the book I took along on our geology field trip.

08:51.543 --> 08:55.052
geology was a science requirement, which I took 
very reluctantly. And I'm sitting there reading

08:55.733 --> 09:01.748
this in the hotel room, nodding and thinking, oh 
God, where has this been? I'm not alone. I'm not

09:03.292 --> 09:04.655
crazy. And a lot of us felt that way. I think that you 
can never really date the beginning of a movement

09:07.743 --> 09:13.270
with any precision. I think if you dated this one, 
it would be in the spring of 1968 at Columbia

09:13.911 --> 09:19.959
University. You may have heard of the student 
uprising and the trying to prevent and

09:20.020 --> 09:29.312
successfully preventing the building of a gym in 
Harlem. which the people who lived there couldn't

09:29.596 --> 09:34.929
use, and many of whom were losing their homes 
because of it. And at that time, during the sit-in,

09:35.991 --> 09:46.997
there was a notice that was put up to all women, you 
are in a liberated area, you don't have to do the

09:35.991 --> 09:46.997
cleaning and cooking anymore. And then in the fall 
of 68, I began graduate school. The Women's Caucus

09:52.076 --> 09:58.908
in our department, Political Science, and in many 
others, was organized in the next few months. And

10:00.150 --> 10:05.740
all of a sudden, between 68 and 69, there was a 
women's movement everywhere. And it wasn't

10:05.780 --> 10:11.871
really well-perceived in the mass media or 
anything like that. the things that happened. The

10:13.784 --> 10:18.129
ERA was brought up in the Congress in 1970. It 
failed then. Then it was brought up in 72. And for a

10:21.613 --> 10:23.995
while, it looked as though it was going to pass. 
Title IX of the Civil Rights Act of 1972 gave women

10:24.536 --> 10:31.443
equal educational opportunities. And it's just 
been amazing. There are now 40% of the law students

10:33.725 --> 10:40.913
in this country are women. In medicine, the 
figures are the same. They approach 50%. The same

10:44.882 --> 10:48.651
is true in academia and graduate programs. The 
changes have just been

10:49.032 --> 10:54.485
overwhelming since that time. Has the feminist 
movement gone to other nations? Absolutely.

11:00.333 --> 11:08.438
There is a feminist movement just about 
everywhere in the world, even in places you

11:00.333 --> 11:08.438
wouldn't expect, like Spain and India. One of the 
exceptions Our near exceptions is Scandinavia,

11:11.858 --> 11:27.223
and I remember reading one article and saying, 
hey, how come in Scandinavia, where the women are

11:11.858 --> 11:27.223
probably most advanced, there's no feminist 
movement, as if to suggest that a feminist

11:11.858 --> 11:27.223
movement is really superfluous. Well, my feeling 
is that there's very comparatively little

11:27.323 --> 11:33.192
feminism in Scandinavia because they don't need 
it. as yet. There is equal opportunity. In fact, I

11:38.324 --> 11:48.763
was at a conference in Sweden this summer, and a 
Swedish sociologist spoke, and she said, well,

11:38.324 --> 11:48.763
the joke is that the state is a woman's best friend. 
With the state, you don't need a man, because you

11:48.803 --> 11:54.032
can have your career, have your children, A lot of 
people in Scandinavia are unwed mothers. And I

11:57.956 --> 12:00.379
don't mean 16-year-olds living in poverty. That 
doesn't happen. I mean 35-year-old women college

12:01.460 --> 12:04.484
professors. And because you get all these 
benefits and you do have equal opportunity, there

12:05.205 --> 12:14.595
is probably... You have the same kind of problem in 
Sweden that you have here. Men do not share

12:15.076 --> 12:18.279
housework equally or childcare. But things are 
very, very different. The goals tend to be

12:21.974 --> 12:26.888
different because there are many countries in 
which Things are less advanced. I mean, in India,

12:29.929 --> 12:39.818
one of the goals is the abolition of sati, the 
custom that when a man dies, his widow jumps on his

12:29.929 --> 12:39.818
funeral pyre. This is illegal in India, but it 
still goes on. And for many women, the choice is

12:45.964 --> 12:52.110
between sati and destitution as a widow. Widows 
are very, very poor. in India. And another thing

12:55.814 --> 13:13.652
that often happens is selective abortion, 
because a fetus is female, which for a woman in Asia

12:55.814 --> 13:13.652
may be a viable choice, because if she has a girl, 
her husband and her in-laws are going to blame her

12:55.814 --> 13:13.652
and make her life miserable. But it would be nice to 
have that change. But yes, there's feminism

13:15.654 --> 13:17.295
everywhere. Let's talk about the feminist 
movement in the 70s. What happened then? or its

13:22.353 --> 13:24.356
goals for that decade? Well, equal educational 
opportunities, which we're very close to,

13:24.376 --> 13:47.950
affordable child care, which we're not, the ERA, 
which of course was defeated, significant

13:24.376 --> 13:47.950
changes in the laws having to do with rape and 
sexual abuse. That has come about. There was very

13:50.095 --> 14:05.978
much a counter-trend, and this was not the fault of 
feminists, although people often blame them,

13:50.095 --> 14:05.978
such a thing as no-fault divorce, which was a 
reform primarily sponsored by... male

14:06.110 --> 14:25.159
legislators and lawyers, which was a very good 
idea, to remove the notion that one person got a

14:06.110 --> 14:25.159
divorce from another who was mistreating him or 
her and had to pay lots of alimony, that divorce was

14:06.110 --> 14:25.159
seen as something that happened when a marriage 
ended. But the problem was that this has meant

14:26.121 --> 14:30.227
increasingly that divorced women, if they have 
children and they have backtracked their career

14:30.207 --> 14:41.179
ambitions to take care of their kids in their home, 
often end up in poverty. But it's been a way for men

14:41.199 --> 14:47.767
to get out of obligations to their families, and 
that's certainly something that has to change.

14:48.888 --> 14:50.090
What did you do in the 70s? I got a PhD. I began my 
publication career. with a book and an article,

14:57.882 --> 15:05.203
the book, The Chains of Protection, the article on 
sexual equality in the Burger Court in 1978. I

15:05.223 --> 15:07.870
joined now. I... myself concentrating on being a 
scholar, and I did. Scholarship took a front seat,

15:16.047 --> 15:28.193
and feminist activism took a back seat, although I 
did go to the march supporting the extension of the

15:16.047 --> 15:28.193
deadline for the ERA in 1978. Let's talk about your 
book, The Chains of Protection. Can you give me a

15:30.836 --> 15:33.360
synopsis of that? Yeah. That was my dissertation, 
and there's one more chapter that I wrote for

15:33.980 --> 15:40.208
Greenwood Press. Basically, I was looking at the 
court decisions pertaining to special labor

15:40.228 --> 15:49.981
legislation for women, what is called protective 
labor legislation. And this was an old idea to...

15:55.038 --> 16:05.137
to pass laws saying that you couldn't make women 
work more than a certain number of hours a day or

15:55.038 --> 16:05.137
make them work at night or lift a lot of weights and 
so on. And in many ways I wish I were writing that

16:06.118 --> 16:11.308
book now because There was an old controversy in 
the early feminist movement which is arising

16:11.542 --> 16:16.876
again now. And essentially what happened in the 
1800s when it became more and more common for women

16:17.377 --> 16:27.964
to work outside the home, you had the same kind of 
sex-segregated labour market. as we do now. There

16:29.207 --> 16:38.728
were men's jobs and women's jobs, and the women's 
jobs paid less, and they had to work longer hours,

16:29.207 --> 16:38.728
and there was less effort given to forming unions. 
So women couldn't gain concessions through

16:38.768 --> 16:44.721
collective bargaining, as men did. And when 
legislators began approaching this problem,

16:44.701 --> 16:57.808
they saw it not as a problem of women have to work 
harder, but a problem of women can't work as hard,

16:44.701 --> 16:57.808
they're weaker, they bear children, they have 
special needs, and so on. And that was essentially

16:58.369 --> 17:02.878
the basis on which protective labor legislation 
was upheld. Now there was a whole group of

17:03.972 --> 17:31.498
feminists, people who supported women's 
suffrage, people like Jane Addams of Hull House,

17:03.972 --> 17:31.498
probably the most famous, but also Josephine 
Goldmark, who wrote some of the early court

17:03.972 --> 17:31.498
briefs, Florence Kelly, and so on, who supported 
this legislation because they essentially

17:03.972 --> 17:31.498
accepted the family with the traditional female 
role as a given. Women needed concessions because

17:31.478 --> 17:38.029
their mission in life was to be wives and mothers. 
Feminists like Anthony and Stanton disagreed and

17:39.140 --> 17:46.850
felt, well, the role in the family might be 
oppressive. We need full equality. It means

17:48.472 --> 17:54.040
moving into the professions, having the choice 
not to bear children, and so on. And while the

17:54.841 --> 18:07.257
advocates of protective labor legislation 
supported women's suffrage, the advocates of

17:54.841 --> 18:07.257
women's suffrage did not always support 
protective labor legislation. After the 19th

18:07.675 --> 18:11.481
Amendment was ratified, then you had a real split. 
The social feminists who became active in the

18:11.902 --> 18:19.034
labor movement still supporting the special 
laws. The National Women's Party, under the

18:19.715 --> 18:28.249
leadership of people like Alice Pohl, 
disagreeing with them, and there were lots of

18:19.715 --> 18:28.249
charges made. Proponents of protective labor 
legislation said that the others were

18:28.229 --> 18:44.005
anti-family, and people like Alice Paul said that 
the social feminists, as they were called, were

18:28.229 --> 18:44.005
really hurting women by endorsing their 
traditional role. You can guess, which I'll bet

18:44.305 --> 18:53.134
without any problem, what side the mainstream 
media, the political parties were on. They were on

18:53.515 --> 18:57.679
the side of the social feminists. We've got the 
same split now. Maybe you remember the

19:02.660 --> 19:06.327
controversy last spring over the mommy track. The 
proposal by a woman who really should know better,

19:06.968 --> 19:12.478
who is an expert in women's working patterns. That 
in the professions, you have two tracks. If the

19:19.208 --> 19:25.854
woman wants to work full time, which means 80 hours 
a week in business and law, she can concentrate on

19:19.208 --> 19:25.854
that. If the woman wants to work part time, which 
means 40 hours, which most of us think of as full

19:26.294 --> 19:36.204
time, and raise children, then she could be on the 
quote unquote mommy track. And she will really

19:36.504 --> 19:42.870
abandon all hope of really reaching the top 
echelons. And a lot of people think that's a very

19:42.850 --> 19:45.653
good idea. I think one woman who would is Sylvia Ann 
Hewlett. Three years ago, she wrote a book which

19:50.477 --> 20:10.815
became very controversial called A Lesser Life, 
and she attacked the feminist movement

19:50.477 --> 20:10.815
represented by people like Ferdinand, now Gloria 
Steinem, and so on, for not understanding that the

19:50.477 --> 20:10.815
central fact of most women's lives was their home 
and their children. Well of course, even if that

20:10.795 --> 20:16.182
were true for everyone, that's only true for about 
20 years. And she felt that what women needed was

20:17.393 --> 20:30.166
maternity leaves, child care, concessions so 
they could be in the home, and possibly even a

20:17.393 --> 20:30.166
salary for housework. That's an extremely 
controversial proposal, which she did not make.

20:34.570 --> 20:37.153
And she would probably support the mommy track. 
But there are also a group of feminists, and I put

20:37.433 --> 20:42.338
myself firmly in this category, group who 
suggests that we need to take a look at the family

20:42.318 --> 20:54.441
itself, because as presently constituted, it is 
oppressive of women. There are a sociologist

20:54.461 --> 21:02.115
named Arlie Hochschild has just published a book 
called The Second Shift, and she looks at working

20:54.461 --> 21:02.115
women. but blue-collar women and professionals 
and sees, you know, now we've got the two-career

21:02.095 --> 21:08.406
marriage, great. The man has one full-time job, 
then he comes home and relaxes. The woman has one

21:13.496 --> 21:17.623
full-time job at work, she comes home and has 
another full-time job of taking care of the kids in

21:17.603 --> 21:22.775
the house, and things are not shared. And the mommy 
track proposal is just really buying into that.

21:26.885 --> 21:30.914
Now, some women, I think you would be one of them, 
say, well, women want it that way. They want to be

21:31.215 --> 21:34.262
the primary caregivers. I don't think so. I doubt 
that any woman wants to come home and start taking

21:36.244 --> 21:45.635
care of her kids while her husband sits in front of 
the TV and drinks a beer. I just do not believe that.

21:48.798 --> 21:53.423
Now, it's certainly true that women bear the 
children. Okay, for nine months they've got

21:53.483 --> 21:56.567
exclusive responsibility. After that, when 
they're breastfeeding, they've got a

21:59.977 --> 22:04.244
responsibility that the man can't share. But when 
you've got somebody whose two kids are seven and

22:04.564 --> 22:11.294
five, I mean, nobody's nursing their 
five-year-olds. And you've got a pattern where

22:13.057 --> 22:17.764
she comes home and starts working, he comes home 
and collapses. Come on. Nobody's going to tell me

22:19.086 --> 22:21.650
that that's just. Right. That sounds analogous to 
the... biological need for a woman to nurture,

22:25.019 --> 22:28.351
that big argument. The biological fuck. I love it. 
Oh, I love it. It was something that was...

22:36.477 --> 22:41.865
invented, I mean, the term was invented by some 
physician, I think, male. You know, that when you

22:42.265 --> 22:55.485
get into your late 30s and early 40s, you hear your 
biological clock ticking, and you get frantic if

22:42.265 --> 22:55.485
you haven't had a baby yet, and I am here to tell you 
that that does not apply to everyone. Of course,

22:55.565 --> 23:01.033
you know, to some extent, we all have needs we are 
told that we have. But it's funny, I was reading a

23:02.161 --> 23:19.910
novel recently, a piece of trash, and it has to do 
with a woman who was in medical school in the late

23:02.161 --> 23:19.910
1950s, and she's talking about, I hear my 
biological clock ticking, well, the term didn't

23:02.161 --> 23:19.910
exist in the 50s. I mean, the writer who is writing 
in 1988 is applying it to this woman. It's as if you

23:25.359 --> 23:27.983
wrote a novel... about the Civil War, and you had 
people saying like and you know and groovy and

23:27.963 --> 23:37.359
other slang from the 1960s. It's just 
anachronistic. It's very stupid. But, you know, I

23:40.945 --> 23:45.313
think now, looking back on the book, Of course, 
with hindsight, knowing that the issue I was

23:45.952 --> 23:55.607
talking about is now so very, very important, I 
would have polarized the book more. I know that I

23:55.627 --> 23:57.430
was criticized. A couple of the reviewers said, 
well, she's too strident. She's too feminist.

24:00.775 --> 24:01.917
She's too prejudiced. And now I think I would not be 
more moderate. I would really be stronger, be more

24:06.043 --> 24:13.815
feminist, be more polarized in writing that book. 
Since this is 1989, we can look back on this past

24:14.690 --> 24:21.036
decade and try to get some perspective on it. What 
happened in the 80s for the movement? Oh, boy. The

24:25.709 --> 24:29.595
feminist movement ran into a big problem, and that 
was known as the Reagan administration. And the

24:30.838 --> 24:40.934
ERA was defeated, which a lot of people attributed 
to extremism, stridency, and all of those things.

24:41.215 --> 24:51.632
And I think that we made a big mistake, but I think 
the big mistake that we made was not understanding

24:41.215 --> 24:51.632
that state legislatures are different from 
Congress. Congress is not a microcosm of... No,

24:51.764 --> 24:56.290
I'm going to put it another way. The 50 state 
legislatures are not a microcosm of Congress.

25:01.076 --> 25:02.878
Different people get elected there. The patterns 
are very different. And I think that in many ways,

25:06.383 --> 25:15.915
the movement in the 80s was not... Well, often it's 
been said that the feminist movement is dead

25:16.351 --> 25:21.920
because it was all these horrible man-haters. And 
essentially, I think that we were not

25:22.400 --> 25:32.416
appropriately willing to condemn certain 
patterns of male behavior. One of the things that

25:32.576 --> 25:37.043
you saw in the 1980s was the divorce revolution. 
More and more, he and she get married, he has a

25:37.428 --> 25:47.182
career, she either stays home or held back on her 
career to raise the kids. Fifteen years later,

25:47.642 --> 25:49.725
they get a divorce. There's one study in 
California that showed that after a divorce, a

25:49.845 --> 26:00.921
man's income rises, the woman keeps the kids, the 
family income rises. And one sociologist

26:01.205 --> 26:07.632
described divorced women with children as the new 
poor. The 80s was also the decade that saw the

26:08.033 --> 26:13.479
feminization of poverty. More and more the people 
who were poor were women raising children. Okay,

26:18.225 --> 26:28.056
one of the things that I should have mentioned and 
that I didn't was that one of the goals of the

26:18.225 --> 26:28.056
feminist movement and of the great majority of the 
people who label themselves feminists is

26:28.036 --> 26:32.022
reproductive freedom, and that includes the 
right to an abortion. And of course there has been,

26:32.062 --> 26:41.816
if you look from Rovers' way to web services in the 
reproductive health services this summer, there

26:32.062 --> 26:41.816
was a significant back step in that. Now the news 
from the latest elections are very good. There

26:45.321 --> 26:48.846
seems to be a pendulum swinging in favor of Joyce. 
Let's talk a little bit about the court. I don't

26:52.635 --> 26:59.187
mean to limit you and say that's your specialty, 
the Constitution of the Supreme Court, but I know

26:52.635 --> 26:59.187
you're an expert on that subject. Did you talk 
about that in the 80s, what the court did? Yes.

27:03.234 --> 27:03.335
Okay. Ronald Reagan ran for president twice. 
promising that he would put justices on the court,

27:06.781 --> 27:27.203
who would overturn Roe versus Wade, who would 
backtrack on affirmative action, who would do a

27:06.781 --> 27:27.203
few other things like restore credit schools, 
which don't have to do with women, but are also

27:06.781 --> 27:27.203
similarly conservative. Very few people 
believed him. The vast majorities who voted for

27:29.664 --> 27:35.735
him in 80 and 84 didn't take him seriously. He meant 
it. They were wrong not to do so. The real irony is

27:41.341 --> 27:50.151
that Reagan's economic policies, which were 
popular for a lot of voters, aren't going to come to

27:41.341 --> 27:50.151
fruition, and his jurisprudence may. I mean, 
these guys, Kennedy, Rehnquist now as chief,

27:50.231 --> 27:59.441
Scalia, want to overturn Roe v. Wade. They are 
slashing affirmative action. The only wild card

28:02.545 --> 28:09.272
was O'Connor, and she came up in the first term when 
the... real stringency with interviewing

28:09.944 --> 28:20.418
potential Supreme Court nominees had not been 
instituted by Edwin Leese and his Justice

28:09.944 --> 28:20.418
Department. By the way, it's not only the Supreme 
Court, it's the whole federal judiciary. Almost

28:25.465 --> 28:29.230
half of the people who are now federal judges have 
been appointed by Reagan. And I think Now, he

28:33.080 --> 28:40.685
clearly has got the majority that is going to kill 
affirmative action and has, essentially. He is

28:41.849 --> 28:45.722
one vote short of the majority on Roe. Now this may 
all become moot. The Illinois case, which is

28:49.380 --> 28:57.173
scheduled for this term, the one that puts heavy 
restrictions on clinics, may not be heard at all.

28:57.233 --> 29:04.885
Because the attorney general who brought the case 
is running for governor and he cannot get money

28:57.233 --> 29:04.885
because of his anti-choice stance. And now he's 
trying to get a compromise in the case and get it

29:05.025 --> 29:11.676
withdrawn from the court. So it's going to be 
interesting to see what Bush is going to do. Bush is

29:18.332 --> 29:21.278
in real trouble on this whole issue. And Bush 
promised that he was going to appoint judges who

29:21.358 --> 29:27.271
would overturn Roe and do all these things. It's 
going to be interesting to notice, if you will.

29:33.374 --> 29:40.324
You were talking about Reagan and how he has so many 
people put on the bench. What could that do to the

29:40.765 --> 29:42.467
movement? I think it has already done a great deal 
and what it has told us is that don't go to the

29:42.487 --> 29:51.079
Supreme Court. The situation is not analogous to 
the blacks in the 1950s to Brown v. Board of

29:51.360 --> 29:57.188
Education. And more and more cases have been filed 
in state courts, which are sometimes receptive.

30:05.896 --> 30:08.939
People have gone to the legislatures and to 
Congress. One of the things that I think could

30:10.040 --> 30:21.630
happen, I think that pro-choice has the potential 
of bringing about a significant realignment in

30:10.040 --> 30:21.630
American politics. I think this is very good news 
for the Democrats. Now, I don't think the

30:24.775 --> 30:29.082
Democrats have the guts to run on the pro-choice 
issue and make it theirs. And I don't think the

30:33.346 --> 30:37.633
Republicans have the stupidity to let them. And 
right now, as I said, if you saw that article in the

30:38.214 --> 30:45.466
Eagle over the weekend, I think the 
identification is with the Democrats. I don't

30:45.887 --> 30:47.570
think it's going to stay that way. So there will not 
be a realignment. But I think basically that's a

30:51.276 --> 30:55.643
failure of nerve on the part of the Democratic 
Party. I've voted Democrat all my life, and I

30:57.496 --> 31:07.029
probably always will, but I'm really pretty sick 
of their cowardice at the national level at the

30:57.496 --> 31:07.029
moment. Let's talk about your other book, 1983, 
Equality Under the Constitution. This was the

31:11.976 --> 31:18.646
book where I tried to go from feminism to a general 
theory of equality. I'll tell you what I do not

31:18.846 --> 31:21.049
mean. There was a cliche that was very common in the 
late 60s and early 70s. You heard this from

31:25.916 --> 31:27.418
Menelak. Let's not talk about women's 
liberation. Let's not talk about human

31:30.000 --> 31:32.062
liberation. And what that meant basically is 
let's not talk about the way I oppress you. Let's

31:36.186 --> 31:39.249
talk about the way other society oppresses me. And 
that isn't what I meant. But I wanted to ask, if you

31:41.090 --> 31:57.405
are a feminist, if you are committed to sexual 
equality, what does that mean in terms of thinking

31:41.090 --> 31:57.405
about society and equality in general? Well, one 
of the things that it seemed to me to mean was that if

31:57.385 --> 32:08.425
you really believe that women and men are equal, 
you're saying that... physical differences

32:08.742 --> 32:13.627
really shouldn't be used as a basis for 
inequality. And you're also saying that sex roles

32:14.087 --> 32:22.696
and, of course, sex itself, sexual activity, 
should not be used as such a basis. Isn't that

32:22.756 --> 32:24.478
really affected the way... There are two chapters 
in the more recent book, one on disability, one on

32:24.618 --> 32:30.504
homosexuality. And those are things that I had to 
think about a lot as a feminist because it does seem

32:30.844 --> 32:36.690
to me that you... A true commitment to sexual 
inequality implies looking at sex roles, at

32:36.670 --> 32:48.170
sexual orientation, and at physical differences 
in a new way. And you know, I went back, there's a

32:48.831 --> 32:55.182
chapter in there on the history of the 14th 
Amendment where I try to look at the whole thing in a

32:48.831 --> 32:55.182
new way. Historical treatments of the 14th 
Amendment were very big at the time that I was

32:55.482 --> 33:01.092
writing. And in fact, there's a new book out, which 
I just read a long review of, for a journal, where

33:02.168 --> 33:16.796
somebody looks at a lot of us who are writing from, 
say, the years from 77 and 85, and I'm one of the

33:02.168 --> 33:16.796
people he mentions. I'm at one extreme, and there 
are a few others at the conservative extreme. And

33:21.305 --> 33:23.868
it was quite interesting. I had gotten what I 
expected, some extremely negative reviews from

33:23.908 --> 33:32.198
the conservative wing of the political science 
profession. I've also got some very positive

33:32.238 --> 33:39.786
feedback, although I used to joke for a while that 
everyone who liked the book wrote me a letter.

33:39.826 --> 33:45.473
Everyone who didn't like the book wrote a review 
and got it published. Okay, you wrote in 1985 on

33:46.415 --> 33:50.005
feminism and ethics. Yes. I was asked to write an 
introductory article for an issue of a journal

33:50.988 --> 33:55.682
called Women in Politics, and that journal itself 
owes its existence to the feminist movement. It

34:02.037 --> 34:05.063
began publication in 1980. And I was basically 
saying, here are the articles we're publishing on

34:06.065 --> 34:13.220
this issue, write what you please. And one of those 
articles by a historian named Robert Booth Fowler

34:17.262 --> 34:35.255
had to do with feminism in a place you wouldn't 
necessarily expect to find feminism, and that is

34:17.262 --> 34:35.255
the evangelical Christian movement. And of 
course, this is all kinds of ethical issues. that

34:38.120 --> 34:40.445
arise here. And then another article written by a 
very good friend of mine, Leslie Goldstein, who

34:41.127 --> 34:54.398
teaches political science at the University of 
Delaware, had to do with the issue of Medicaid

34:41.127 --> 34:54.398
funding for abortions and where we should stop and 
all of this. She looked at the All of the biological

34:57.104 --> 35:07.374
data on the fetus, you know, when can we say it 
becomes human and all of that, and found that, you

34:57.104 --> 35:07.374
know, for one thing, life doesn't begin. Life is 
passed on from the sperm in the ovum. And that it's

35:11.418 --> 35:18.125
really not true that at the moment that these 
unite, you have a human being. At the moment that

35:18.505 --> 35:25.812
these unite, you have some tissue which has about a 
50% chance of being miscarried. or you wouldn't

35:25.792 --> 35:34.161
even call it that, as almost being a kind of tumor 
which exists in the uterus for a week or two and then

35:25.792 --> 35:34.161
leaves. The whole process of fertilization, 
implantation, and becoming a pregnancy is a very,

35:34.462 --> 35:44.353
very complex process. And she talked about the 
ethics of late abortion and all of that. And I

35:48.958 --> 35:51.681
decided to write on feminism and ethics and what 
the question is also something that interests me

35:51.661 --> 36:16.774
having been brought up as an episcopalian having 
gone to church to sunday school i'm now unitarian

35:51.661 --> 36:16.774
and having been interested in religious 
questions and ethical questions all my life how

35:51.661 --> 36:16.774
does a feminist live a moral life given a 
commitment to sexual equality what does this mean

36:17.480 --> 36:27.220
And one of the things that has always struck me and 
has struck most people is that

36:17.480 --> 36:27.220
women, in a sense, bear moral responsibility. If 
you go to the supermarket, you see all these

36:31.777 --> 36:40.347
magazines directed at women and giving guidance 
how to run your family, your house. There is no such

36:40.407 --> 36:44.513
thing as men's family circle. There are no 
magazines on fathering. There's lots of

36:46.855 --> 36:48.898
magazines for mothers. If you look at Parents 
Magazine, look at its advertising, it's very

36:49.379 --> 36:57.088
clear who they expect to buy and read against 
mothers. And you go to, you know, you look at

36:57.575 --> 37:01.720
self-help books in the library. They're usually 
addressed to women. Who goes to church or to temple

37:05.144 --> 37:09.330
or listens to sermons? Women. And that it's, women 
are the targets of moral exhortations. Men are

37:17.620 --> 37:19.262
not. And in a way, there is certainly an imbalance. 
Women are the ones who are made to feel guilty about

37:24.665 --> 37:29.794
their parents, about their children, about 
everything else. Men are not. But on the other

37:31.597 --> 37:35.563
hand, do we want... to say that it's okay for women 
to act like men. And I argue that no, I mean, you

37:40.307 --> 37:46.793
don't want, just because men walk out on their 
families, it doesn't mean that women can. Just

37:46.833 --> 38:02.826
because men do not have the burden of doing things 
for people, visiting the sick, helping the poor,

37:46.833 --> 38:02.826
taking care of your ill mother, your children, 
your neighbors, that's necessary. Just because

38:03.086 --> 38:05.128
men don't do that does not really mean that I think 
that women should give it up too. There, I think,

38:10.676 --> 38:19.932
has to be a balance between excessive 
responsibility and some sort of moral

38:10.676 --> 38:19.932
responsibility. And I talk a lot about 
evangelical Christianity in that article

38:23.873 --> 38:28.259
because of course that's very central. What are 
your duties as a human being in Christianity? And

38:33.826 --> 38:48.885
how, you know, I point out that the women who are 
feminists within evangelical Christianity

38:33.826 --> 38:48.885
reject all the patriarchal notions, but on the 
other hand, they wouldn't be comfortable with the

38:33.826 --> 38:48.885
message that you get from what we used to call the 
human potential movement in the 60s. Maybe you've

38:53.674 --> 38:59.340
seen the poster that says, I do my thing, you do your 
thing. Okay, you wouldn't be comfortable with

38:59.360 --> 39:01.242
that. You also wouldn't be comfortable with the 
go-for-it-baby-and-grab-it school of thought

39:01.542 --> 39:15.497
self-help books, which are often written for 
women in business, that this is something which to

39:01.542 --> 39:15.497
a serious Christian even a feminist or to anyone 
with serious ethical principles is just not

39:16.118 --> 39:22.993
acceptable. Let's get back to the religious issue 
again. There's an idea of thinking of God as

39:27.964 --> 39:31.492
mother. How do you feel about that? I like it 
because the ways we think of God are culturally

39:35.508 --> 39:41.815
determined. It makes at least as much sense to 
think of God as mother as God as father. I mean,

39:46.340 --> 39:57.833
Judeo-Christian tradition is patriarchal, so 
naturally we see it as God the Father, and of course

39:46.340 --> 39:57.833
in Christianity it's Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, 
and that really kind of lets you out if you're a

39:46.340 --> 39:57.833
woman. But you know, there are some religions The 
Eastern religions do not really conceive of God as

40:00.803 --> 40:09.319
a figure of such a sort at all. And of course, these 
have influenced the Eastern version of

40:09.480 --> 40:13.627
Christianity. For example, in Japanese, the 
Lord's Prayer is not. our Father, it is our God who

40:18.657 --> 40:30.878
art in heaven because in Japanese culture it 
simply makes no sense to conceive of God as a Father

40:18.657 --> 40:30.878
and women in various religions are bringing up new 
patterns. And I know the Unitarian Church has a

40:33.581 --> 40:40.932
curriculum that we're running there now, which is 
called Cakes for the Queen of Heaven. And that's

40:40.972 --> 40:48.985
from a quotation from Jeremiah, and it's a very 
nasty quotation, saying, you know, the women like

40:40.972 --> 40:48.985
the pagan religions. instead of Judaism, which of 
course for him was the truth. And you go back and

40:52.791 --> 40:59.001
look at pagan religions, you look at Wicca, for 
example, which is the art of witchcraft. A witch is

40:59.041 --> 41:05.832
not only somebody who is evil, although that was an 
outgrowth of that tradition. But Wicca is, for

41:07.114 --> 41:12.863
example, very much involved with the art of 
natural healing through witchcraft. herbs and

41:12.843 --> 41:14.826
things of that sort. It really has been distorted 
by patriarchal Judeo-Christian tradition. And

41:21.257 --> 41:35.641
some of the Roman gods and goddesses, for example, 
the myth, which is in both Greek and Roman

41:21.257 --> 41:35.641
mythology, of Demeter and Persephone, of how the 
seasons got started, the mother-daughter

41:21.257 --> 41:35.641
relation there. And a lot of, within many 
religions, really all of the mainstream

41:40.467 --> 41:50.102
religions, there is some effort going on to 
reclaim this part of the tradition, which

41:40.467 --> 41:50.102
existed, which did exist. The notion of God, 
conceiving of God as a mother, is not something the

41:50.683 --> 41:56.672
20th century feminists made up. It was in the 
history of our traditions and really buried. And

42:01.099 --> 42:05.766
that is being claimed, and a lot of research is 
going on about that. Let's move on to your next

42:07.214 --> 42:13.060
writing, 1987, Sexuality and the Law. Yeah, that 
is an article that I did for the American

42:13.500 --> 42:33.259
Encyclopedia of the Judicial System, and I was 
invited to do that, and that pulled through in a lot

42:13.500 --> 42:33.259
of things about all rape that I wrote about 
homosexuality and the ways that it has been

42:13.500 --> 42:33.259
conceived in law and so on. There was a theme of that 
article, and basically I was saying that

42:37.522 --> 42:45.453
Traditionally, the law has punished people who 
deviate from the patriarchal norm. It has

42:45.473 --> 42:49.838
punished homosexuals and sometimes even 
unmarried women. And it's punished them more

42:50.359 --> 42:56.307
consistently than people who violently act out. 
the patriarchal norm. That's essentially what

42:57.589 --> 43:00.472
rape and incest are. They are a violent acting out 
of the norm that men, that fathers have power, that

43:00.793 --> 43:11.966
men have sexual power over women and can demand 
sexual services, and so on. And even though the

43:12.026 --> 43:20.877
text of our laws has very heavy penalties for rape, 
they have in the past included death, that's not

43:12.026 --> 43:20.877
what happens. Only, I think, about one in ten 
rapists are punished. And that was the second.

43:25.491 --> 43:27.573
That is really not scholarship. That is an article 
for a general audience. That's an article for

43:30.036 --> 43:38.564
somebody who wants to write a paper, to go read the 
article and look at the bibliography and get some

43:30.036 --> 43:38.564
ideas. And that really is, I think, who those 
encyclopedias will be used by. They'll be used by

43:42.709 --> 43:47.053
students who want a starting point. Okay, we're 
going to flip the tape. Okay.
