00:05.397 --> 00:11.806
Well, speaking of the books, Reisner's books, 
have you ever read any of the books that any of the

00:05.397 --> 00:11.806
other POWs have written? Oh, yeah, I have. I've 
read Robbie's book, and I read my old roommate, Red

00:13.068 --> 00:20.379
McDaniel, wrote a book. I don't remember all of 
them at the moment, but I did read most of them.

00:33.017 --> 00:33.417
Uh-huh. Okay. There were some prisoners released 
early, and the people like we talk about, the

00:34.675 --> 00:40.433
cooperated. They were released early, 
obviously, because they did cooperate. What was

00:44.968 --> 00:48.499
the POW's feelings in the camp about those men? 
Well, we felt they were dead wrong to accept

00:49.593 --> 00:58.060
preferential treatment and so on. But the big 
thing that was so wrong about it was that it played

00:58.541 --> 01:08.870
right into the hands of the Vietnam 
propagandists. They served their purpose by

01:08.990 --> 01:18.418
releasing three people at a time and saying, You 
know, they had those people

01:18.820 --> 01:35.024
giving the answers that they were assured, you 
know, before they released them, that they had

01:18.820 --> 01:35.024
people that are going to say the things they wanted 
them to say when they got out. And that's why they

01:35.044 --> 01:37.508
released them. And they did it strictly for the 
benefit of the Vietnamese, not for anything other

01:37.528 --> 01:46.001
than that. I mean, North Vietnam. That was 
cooperating to the nth degree with the enemy. And

01:58.996 --> 02:12.313
of course, we all had discussed that and said that 
we would not get involved in a program that would

01:58.996 --> 02:12.313
lead to something like that. Because you could 
very easily detect what was going on if If they

02:19.402 --> 02:28.032
started moving in that kind of a direction with 
you, you'd know what they were up to. Actually, the

02:28.132 --> 02:48.075
only one person that

02:28.132 --> 02:48.075
our so-called senior officers authorized to go 
along with the D and try to get released was a guy

02:28.132 --> 02:48.075
named I never think of these names for so many 
years. He was a young seaman who they captured in a

02:54.168 --> 03:01.779
real freak way up there, and he was with us for a 
while. He had fallen overboard off of a destroyer

03:02.219 --> 03:10.070
out in the Gulf of Tonkin and got picked up by 
Vietnamese fishermen. And he was in our prison

03:10.851 --> 03:12.053
system. He was an American. And his name was 
something like Hagler or Hagar. I've forgotten

03:17.961 --> 03:19.243
his name now. But anyhow, he was a young fella. 
Wasn't an officer. And I think our people, our

03:24.614 --> 03:41.476
senior guys had told him when he reported that they 
were making approaches to him along the lines that

03:24.614 --> 03:41.476
led him to think that they might be thinking about 
sending him. And they told him to go ahead and play

03:41.496 --> 03:44.320
along with them. and obtain his release, and they 
gave him information to take home with him. So he

03:53.392 --> 04:01.164
was the only one of the, I think there were 12 
overall that got released. None of them were

04:01.184 --> 04:09.597
authorized to do that except

04:01.184 --> 04:09.597
him. Most people... the POWs as having to endure 
the hardships and everything, but your family, of

04:12.008 --> 04:18.395
course, was worried. Did they ever have any notice 
that you were a prisoner of war, or were you just

04:18.635 --> 04:23.220
considered missing for that time? I was missing 
until June of 1970 is when Ann found out. So you'd

04:31.470 --> 04:33.612
been over there about two years then, right? Well, 
I was shot down in December of 67, so 68, 69. It was

04:38.497 --> 04:41.661
two and a half years or so. when she finally got some 
confirmation that I was alive. That's the first

04:47.280 --> 04:49.382
she'd heard of me in any way.

04:54.848 --> 05:11.445
But that came as a real surprise to me, and I didn't 
know it until I got home because my assumption from

04:54.848 --> 05:11.445
the beginning was that I was known to be a prisoner 
because I had made several transmissions on my

05:11.780 --> 05:15.625
little radio coming down in the parachute. You 
know, this parachute opens at 13,000 feet, and I

05:15.645 --> 05:24.395
was coming down for a long time, and I was up pretty 
high when I made the transmissions. We had good

05:24.936 --> 05:38.732
communications coverage of the whole area up 
there in Package 6 with communications aircraft,

05:24.936 --> 05:38.732
special aircraft that had all the communications 
gear on. So, you know, I just didn't dream that

05:39.235 --> 05:47.311
those communications, that those transmissions 
that I made weren't recorded. I just assumed they

05:48.694 --> 05:50.718
were. And went from there, I just didn't, from the 
very beginning, I just said, well, you know, they

05:51.440 --> 05:56.791
know I'm okay. But That wasn't the case at all. They 
didn't get anything. And nobody, and I had a lot of

06:00.977 --> 06:13.896
close friends in the war zone down there, and in the 
headquarters down at Seventh Air Force, and so on.

06:14.697 --> 06:28.277
General Bo, among them, General Tomlin, and they 
all tried to get, they screened every

06:14.697 --> 06:28.277
communication they could find and so on, tried to 
get some clue, but nobody knew anything. I mean,

06:28.865 --> 06:40.793
there wasn't any communications that they could

06:28.865 --> 06:40.793
make any determination, positive determination 
that I had made. So I was strictly missing an ax

06:41.856 --> 06:44.983
until one time. You did arrive back in the States. 
What was your response to the Americans' actions

06:49.965 --> 06:53.849
at the time? I mean, POWs were given a fairly warm 
welcome, and then again, there were the awarding

06:54.249 --> 07:02.036
senators also, the people that were opposing the 
war. I didn't see any of those. All I ever got when we

07:04.639 --> 07:15.849
got back was strictly, you know, fantastic 
reception from everybody that I came in contact

07:04.639 --> 07:15.849
with. And it was just... a very euphoric

07:18.038 --> 07:27.710
time for a good while.

07:29.272 --> 07:33.317
Well, it hasn't stopped yet. How was it like to see 
your kids again? They'd grown up while you were

07:37.703 --> 07:43.330
gone, or at least six years change or seven years 
change? Yeah, right. They'd grown quite a bit. My

07:47.958 --> 07:55.928
kids ranged in age from seven to 14.

07:59.193 --> 08:01.856
And then when I got home, they ranged from 13 to 20. 
That was quite a change. Kathy was beginning her

08:06.822 --> 08:12.650
junior year, I suppose, in college. And John 
was...

08:18.265 --> 08:21.488
It was sophomore year. So there was a big chance 
they'd grown up, of course. But they really hadn't

08:26.432 --> 08:33.038
changed personality-wise.

08:33.959 --> 08:35.901
The kids were all the same. And I had gotten a few 
little snapshots in the last year or so while I was

08:36.281 --> 08:45.049
up there. And also, when I arrived at Clark, I had a 
big letter with some current pictures and that

08:48.286 --> 08:56.355
sort of thing were there for me. I didn't have any 
trouble recognizing my family.

09:02.422 --> 09:16.538
Well, to close it up, do you have any statements to 
summarize your feelings about the conflict in

09:02.422 --> 09:16.538
Vietnam or about the hardships you had to endure, 
the men over there had to endure?

09:20.146 --> 09:24.631
No, I don't know specifically.

09:27.454 --> 09:32.839
The Vietnam War turned out most unfortunately.

09:33.440 --> 09:48.195
I think, though, that in the fall of 72, when it 
became pretty obvious to us up there, too, because

09:33.440 --> 09:48.195
a lot of things were happening, that our release 
was getting pretty close. And that was before the

09:48.665 --> 09:52.971
election, if you recall, in November. They 
publicized this famous statement by Kissinger

09:53.312 --> 10:01.404
that peace is at hand or something like that. So it 
was

10:02.445 --> 10:06.351
getting close. And then the obvious thing 
happened that always happens with the

10:06.772 --> 10:13.281
Vietnamese. There's no way you can negotiate with 
them anything reasonable. So at the last minute,

10:18.263 --> 10:26.692
they just threw a monkey wrench into the whole 
thing. And so the president sent the B-52s to Hanoi

10:27.654 --> 10:37.685
in December.

10:38.446 --> 10:46.735
For 11 days, they had airplanes in the sky 24 hours a 
day over Hanoi. B-52s at night mostly, and during

10:47.288 --> 10:54.915
the day, fighters and so on. That 11 days typifies, 
well, in the first place, it was a very courageous

10:56.157 --> 11:15.996
decision that had to be made by the one man alone, 
and he had to do it, and he did it knowing that, you

10:56.157 --> 11:15.996
know, there would be a lot of criticism about it and 
so on. But it had to be done, and it was very

11:16.634 --> 11:19.898
effective. If he hadn't have done that, chances 
are, you know, we might still be in Vietnam. But

11:26.608 --> 11:28.430
those 11 days wiped them out. And it didn't, you 
know, they very selectively bombed the different

11:29.712 --> 11:39.946
areas, the industrial areas and so on up there. All 
around Hanoi, I was right underneath it all, you

11:39.966 --> 11:43.831
know, in the prison. Plaster was coming off the 
walls in there. So, you know, I could see what was

11:47.212 --> 11:50.857
happening.

11:53.000 --> 12:02.312
But if we had done that, you know, like in 1964, the 
war would have been over in a week. We wouldn't have

12:03.293 --> 12:09.762
lost 50,000 people in over a period of, you know, 
eight, nine years. So, that's hindsight, but it

12:17.030 --> 12:21.878
You know, it's something that a lot of people knew 
about and knew should have been done. But that war,

12:23.260 --> 12:41.029
of course, as everybody knows, got involved in the 
political process and the trying to run the war

12:23.260 --> 12:41.029
from Washington and without without any regard 
for military principles and so on, is what got us in

12:41.515 --> 12:49.726
trouble with Vietnam. Had we gone into that war 
with the intention of winning it right away, it

12:51.048 --> 13:00.200
would have been over within a matter of weeks. 
There wouldn't have been any problem whatsoever.

13:05.782 --> 13:08.406
You know, again, that's hindsight. If Barry 
Goldwater had been elected in 1964, then we

13:08.706 --> 13:17.339
wouldn't have had a Vietnam War that would have 
lasted any time to amount to anything. It would

13:17.359 --> 13:20.283
have been over in a real big hurry. But that wasn't 
what made it happen. But I, you know, as far as

13:26.352 --> 13:33.983
myself personally is concerned, I was just... 
doing my job and I was one of those guys that never,

13:34.975 --> 13:54.814
you know, I didn't, I went up there and flew up over 
Hanoi every day and I did, expected to fly my full

13:34.975 --> 13:54.814
tour and not get shot down. I just knew, you know, it 
wouldn't ever happen to me, but it sure as heck did.

13:59.558 --> 14:04.763
I was one of the unfortunate few as far as that's 
concerned. And when it happened, if it had cost me

14:05.705 --> 14:21.708
my life, it would have been, you know, that's the 
way it would have gone because I was just doing what

14:05.705 --> 14:21.708
I'm supposed to do. And so I don't have any qualms 
about...

14:34.291 --> 14:38.939
doing my job, being in the military, and taking 
what comes with that. And for me, it turned out

14:40.682 --> 14:49.296
being in prison for a good long stretch, but that's 
the breaks as far as I'm concerned. And I'm just

14:49.316 --> 14:53.984
extremely fortunate that in the end, it turned out 
the way it did. And I got back to my family and a great

14:54.885 --> 15:00.855
life the only country in the world to live in, you 
know, as far as I'm concerned. So overall, I'm

15:05.838 --> 15:16.653
extremely fortunate and basically I'm fortunate 
to be an American. And then, you know, to have all

15:18.235 --> 15:25.746
the things that that allows me to have, including 
my family and so on.
