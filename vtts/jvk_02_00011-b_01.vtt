00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:14.050
The Aspirations Committee has appointed faculty and staff to recommend what A&M ought to aspire to be in 1976, the 100th anniversary year.

00:00:14.852 --> 00:00:19.220
And they recommend coeducation, non-compulsory core, and so forth.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.187
Were you at all involved in any of that effort?

00:00:23.567 --> 00:00:25.110
Were you on any of those committees?

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.304
Well, it seemed like I was on, had a minor role on some of those committees.

00:00:29.404 --> 00:00:31.346
I was not a chair of any of those committees.

00:00:31.767 --> 00:00:37.994
What was the, as far as you and your colleagues, what opinion did you all have about any of those changes?

00:00:38.415 --> 00:00:41.799
Well, I think we were nearly all very much in favor of it.

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.901
I don't remember any opposition to that at all.

00:00:45.263 --> 00:00:49.528
And, of course, we were in a field where, that we would be affected a lot by having women students.

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:51.763
And we were ready for it.

00:00:51.903 --> 00:00:53.207
We were willing to do it.

00:00:53.708 --> 00:01:00.026
All right, among the first changes that came as a result of that was the admission of black students.

00:01:00.808 --> 00:01:02.794
And you said that that touched you.

00:01:02.894 --> 00:01:05.762
Please describe that in as great a detail as you can.

00:01:05.742 --> 00:01:08.830
Well, this was earlier, I think, than the 70s.

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.577
Oh, this early 60s.

00:01:11.657 --> 00:01:12.800
Yeah, somewhere in there.

00:01:13.401 --> 00:01:22.384
I remember it was right after they had that big story about over in

00:01:23.596 --> 00:01:29.030
blacks trying to enter University of Alabama and the governor was out there to block it.

00:01:29.952 --> 00:01:33.943
There was just lots of publicity about that on TV and everything.

00:01:33.963 --> 00:01:40.660
And then I found out that my class, a survey course in

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:58.950
general psychology, he was about 75 in that class, he was going to meet on a Monday morning, meet five days a week for an hour and a half, and it was in an academic building, and that it would have two black students, a man and a woman, and they were to be the first undergraduate black students ever to attend A&M.

00:01:59.571 --> 00:02:01.254
There hadn't been graduate students before.

00:02:02.356 --> 00:02:08.065
And since this was right after that case over in Alabama that was so famous,

00:02:08.197 --> 00:02:09.740
Am I right about it being Alabama?

00:02:10.581 --> 00:02:16.250
I thought, well, maybe there'll be TV cameras there, or maybe the newspaper will be there.

00:02:17.232 --> 00:02:18.494
But nobody cared at all.

00:02:18.955 --> 00:02:22.100
There was not any excitement about it at all.

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.986
It happened to be a little larger class than usual for that

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:45.358
for those days it was about, every seat was occupied in one of the larger, it was about 70 maybe in there, 60 or 70, which was all that room would contain, and the two black people and then the 68 or so, 60-some odd white students.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.182
You know, there just wasn't anything to it.

00:02:47.383 --> 00:02:48.885
I just taught my class.

00:02:49.145 --> 00:02:51.509
How did you learn they were going to be in that class?

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:54.893
It was in the newspaper, but it wasn't blown up just real big.

00:02:54.993 --> 00:03:02.364
And I might have been told, I think I was told by, you know, we register all, we see everybody who registers in those days.

00:03:02.404 --> 00:03:04.387
They come around to your table and register.

00:03:04.427 --> 00:03:08.172
So it was well known that they would be there.

00:03:08.232 --> 00:03:11.076
Did you see anything?

00:03:11.545 --> 00:03:15.149
relating to their being in that class by anybody else?

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:16.270
Not at all.

00:03:16.311 --> 00:03:21.136
I was really pleasantly surprised, you know.

00:03:21.156 --> 00:03:30.887
I thought there'd be at least a little excitement about it or I didn't expect any real trouble, you know, but I thought there would be a little bit of disturbance or excitement or...

00:03:31.468 --> 00:03:32.709
These were undergraduate.

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:33.671
They were undergraduates.

00:03:33.991 --> 00:03:35.533
And they were not a husband and wife?

00:03:35.893 --> 00:03:36.534
No, they were not.

00:03:37.075 --> 00:03:40.118
And it happened that the man I knew slightly.

00:03:40.503 --> 00:03:45.188
His name was Dunn, and he worked over in the MSC as a shoeshine man.

00:03:46.029 --> 00:03:47.610
And I had met him.

00:03:48.111 --> 00:03:49.732
I guess he'd probably shine my shoes.

00:03:50.513 --> 00:03:52.855
And everybody knew him.

00:03:52.875 --> 00:03:54.497
A lot of people knew him.

00:03:55.218 --> 00:03:55.999
And he was one of them.

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:57.980
I don't know if he ever graduated from A.M.M.

00:03:58.001 --> 00:03:58.341
or not.

00:03:58.401 --> 00:03:59.542
What about the woman?

00:03:59.562 --> 00:04:00.023
Do you know?

00:04:00.403 --> 00:04:07.950
I can't remember her name, but she was very... made a nice appearance, nice manners.

00:04:09.192 --> 00:04:10.493
She was...

00:04:11.249 --> 00:04:19.485
about maybe a little above the usual age for an undergraduate student, but not much, you know, maybe about 21, 22 years old.

00:04:19.505 --> 00:04:25.456
And neither of them did anything special to come up to talk to you after the class was over or anything like that?

00:04:25.476 --> 00:04:25.696
No.

00:04:25.716 --> 00:04:27.079
I called the roll and they said, here.

00:04:28.461 --> 00:04:30.085
They didn't even say, here.

00:04:30.606 --> 00:04:34.573
And did, as far as you recall, they did okay academically?

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:36.291
Yes.

00:04:36.932 --> 00:04:38.155
Okay is the right word.

00:04:39.618 --> 00:04:39.718
Yeah.

00:04:39.738 --> 00:04:41.121
All right.

00:04:41.141 --> 00:04:49.660
See, there were a few that summer, a few black students that were here because Earl Rudder called the Pentagon

00:04:50.180 --> 00:05:00.682
and told them when they sent that summer's group of Army enlisted men at Army expense, send a few, include a few black students.

00:05:01.765 --> 00:05:07.176
All right, then that fall when we were back

00:05:07.156 --> 00:05:14.151
to the normal enrollment, do you remember any problems regarding racial integration?

00:05:14.532 --> 00:05:16.596
You know, after that, I didn't even notice it, Haskell.

00:05:17.177 --> 00:05:23.270
The first time was noticeable, you know, but after that, I think having black students was rare.

00:05:23.491 --> 00:05:27.038
You know, they were very much in the minority.

00:05:27.018 --> 00:05:32.471
But I never thought much about it, and neither did my other students, and it was no longer even an event.

00:05:33.734 --> 00:05:35.077
And most of the time I couldn't tell you.

00:05:35.117 --> 00:05:39.587
You know, if you'd ask me during the semester, do you have any black students, I'd have to stop and think.

00:05:40.369 --> 00:05:43.356
Now, we'd always had women in summer school here.

00:05:44.045 --> 00:05:50.495
but at about that time we had women for the first time in the two long semesters.

00:05:50.515 --> 00:05:55.483
Do you remember women in class for the first time in the long semesters?

00:05:55.543 --> 00:05:57.486
Was there any difference there?

00:05:59.750 --> 00:05:59.970
No.

00:06:00.271 --> 00:06:02.614
That transition was very smooth.

00:06:02.634 --> 00:06:06.741
I can see why you would ask that, but I didn't notice it.

00:06:07.161 --> 00:06:07.983
I didn't notice much.

00:06:08.644 --> 00:06:10.086
How long before?

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:28.334
I heard people say, and I kind of noticed it myself, just an informal observation, that people started working a little harder on their books and started being a little more interested in academics when women came.

00:06:28.715 --> 00:06:29.536
You mean the students?

00:06:29.636 --> 00:06:31.821
Right.

00:06:32.527 --> 00:06:39.115
Part of that might just be talk, you know, but I do believe there is something to that.

00:06:39.155 --> 00:06:40.596
I think that it started to...

00:06:40.636 --> 00:06:41.357
It became more competitive.

00:06:41.457 --> 00:06:42.158
I believe it did.

00:06:43.299 --> 00:06:51.028
I don't have any figures on that, but that was a general impression that I heard a lot of people say, and I didn't find any reason to contradict that.

00:06:54.212 --> 00:07:01.200
Do you agree with my theory that racial integration among the students went more smoothly here

00:07:01.923 --> 00:07:05.107
than the admission and enrollment of women.

00:07:06.529 --> 00:07:15.199
That in some areas of the corps and so forth, it wasn't easy to be the first female, but there never was any problem being the first black that I knew of.

00:07:15.379 --> 00:07:17.982
There was not any problem being the first black.

00:07:18.343 --> 00:07:26.833
There was not any, and I think there were some, I heard some criticism, nothing violent

00:07:27.168 --> 00:07:29.050
or varied and didn't amount to too much.

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:37.497
But I did hear some kind of cynicism about women coming, but I had never heard that about blacks.

00:07:37.577 --> 00:07:41.381
And I think that was partly because it was just time.

00:07:41.461 --> 00:07:45.484
If it had happened a year or two earlier, there might have been.

00:07:45.625 --> 00:07:50.029
But when it happened, there just was not any problem in that transition.

00:07:50.589 --> 00:07:57.175
Now, in the late 60s, what was happening to enrollment numbers in your classes and in education in general?

00:07:59.298 --> 00:08:00.459
It didn't affect me much.

00:08:01.821 --> 00:08:03.042
Your classes didn't get larger?

00:08:03.103 --> 00:08:05.325
We had more classes, but the classes weren't larger.

00:08:05.806 --> 00:08:09.610
We had more faculty, so it didn't really affect me much that way.

00:08:11.072 --> 00:08:12.313
But the place did get bigger.

00:08:12.514 --> 00:08:23.807
Oh yes, the campus got much more crowded and I saw lots more people and lots more traffic and parking started becoming a problem where it was absolutely no problem at all.

00:08:24.788 --> 00:08:27.111
And I noticed those, but as far as classes,

00:08:28.036 --> 00:08:35.143
All through my entire teaching career, I just taught my classes, you know.

00:08:35.383 --> 00:08:38.306
Where did you teach, where did you park in the earliest years?

00:08:39.107 --> 00:08:40.168
Where was your parking place?

00:08:40.969 --> 00:08:49.357
Well, right adjacent, north of the academic building was a parking lot, and I just parked there, didn't pay anything, just parked there.

00:08:51.539 --> 00:08:54.642
I did happen to have very excellent parking all the time I was here.

00:08:54.702 --> 00:08:57.385
I was fortunate in that regard.

00:08:57.365 --> 00:09:01.569
And I don't know whether we even locked our cars in those early years.

00:09:01.709 --> 00:09:03.551
I always did, but people kidded me.

00:09:03.891 --> 00:09:06.433
Oh, how silly to lock your car, but I always did.

00:09:07.915 --> 00:09:12.299
City slicker from Austin locking your car, they would say.

00:09:12.319 --> 00:09:16.423
Did you and your colleagues feel that A&M was moving forward in the late 60s?

00:09:17.303 --> 00:09:18.264
Progress in Bing May?

00:09:18.484 --> 00:09:19.165
Yes, we did.

00:09:22.088 --> 00:09:24.570
Then were you aware that

00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:27.294
Mr. Rutter dies in early 1970.

00:09:27.815 --> 00:09:31.921
Were you and your colleagues aware of any health problems that he had?

00:09:31.961 --> 00:09:34.665
No, I was very shocked by that.

00:09:34.785 --> 00:09:35.806
I didn't expect that.

00:09:36.427 --> 00:09:39.031
He died pretty young, you know, and I was really surprised.

00:09:39.832 --> 00:09:41.935
I think that he had

00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:48.638
He had moved on Lee Street, which is close to where I live.

00:09:48.678 --> 00:09:50.161
I live right at the end of Lee Street.

00:09:50.822 --> 00:09:54.328
And I believe he was living there at the time of his death.

00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:59.637
And I was very surprised and shocked and sad about that.

00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:01.902
You want to guess how old he was?

00:10:02.703 --> 00:10:03.023
Uh-huh.

00:10:03.043 --> 00:10:08.990
I think he was definitely in his 50s, maybe 57, 58, right along in there.

00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:11.493
One month short of his 60th birthday.

00:10:11.513 --> 00:10:12.434
Is that right?

00:10:12.454 --> 00:10:19.082
Which means, as a reservist, he did not qualify for veterans benefits upon his death.

00:10:20.303 --> 00:10:28.172
And even his classmate, Olin Teague, chairman of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, could not get it changed.

00:10:28.456 --> 00:10:31.020
Just a few months short, huh?

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:31.220
Yeah.

00:10:31.961 --> 00:10:37.289
Then that fall, 1970, Jack Williams becomes our president.

00:10:37.309 --> 00:10:40.594
What impression did he make upon you and others quickly?

00:10:40.855 --> 00:10:45.722
Oh, I was very much impressed and liked him, and I remember that big convocation.

00:10:45.782 --> 00:10:52.593
I've never been much for a ceremony, but that was really a nice ceremony that everybody seemed to like.

00:10:53.114 --> 00:10:54.516
What was impressive about him?

00:10:55.577 --> 00:10:57.400
What made such a good

00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:58.602
positive feeling?

00:11:02.788 --> 00:11:05.331
Well, he spoke real well.

00:11:05.752 --> 00:11:14.004
He had a good way of expressing himself and good vocabulary and things like that.

00:11:14.224 --> 00:11:18.631
Did you all think of him as an academic?

00:11:19.211 --> 00:11:20.974
Yes, very much so.

00:11:21.848 --> 00:11:23.491
I didn't know much about him before.

00:11:23.511 --> 00:11:25.474
I just didn't have any reason to.

00:11:25.614 --> 00:11:35.369
But as soon as I heard about him, and so met him, and saw him, and interacted with him a little, well, I was very much impressed by his academic credentials.

00:11:35.489 --> 00:11:45.865
And I remember thinking that as much as I admired General Rutter, that he was probably a little bit

00:11:45.845 --> 00:11:54.516
better for running an organization like this at that stage of its development, you know, after Rutter had done so much to get it to that stage.

00:11:56.258 --> 00:12:02.226
I imagine Rutter would have done real well at any stage, but I do remember having that feeling.

00:12:02.526 --> 00:12:13.060
I tell people, Rutter couldn't have done what Williams did, and Williams couldn't have done what Rutter did, because Williams politically would have gotten shot down.

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:14.181
Oh, you're not an Aggie.

00:12:14.465 --> 00:12:17.888
You're wanting to change the court and admit women, da, da, da, da, da.

00:12:18.369 --> 00:12:18.809
But Mr.

00:12:18.909 --> 00:12:22.934
Rudder didn't have the know-how about all these new graduate programs and so forth.

00:12:23.634 --> 00:12:26.918
Now, education by then is growing and growing.

00:12:28.719 --> 00:12:31.222
Did you all feel you were part of something that was happening?

00:12:31.742 --> 00:12:32.183
Oh, yes.

00:12:33.925 --> 00:12:44.235
And let's see, Paul Hensling by then, was he, when the College of Education was created, describe the department that you were in.

00:12:44.924 --> 00:12:52.216
I was in the Department of Educational Psychology, and Art Roach was our first department head, and he's a counseling psychologist.

00:12:52.236 --> 00:12:52.977
Where did he come from?

00:12:53.998 --> 00:13:08.281
Well, he had already been here several years, but he, well, his Ph.D. is from Notre Dame, and I don't know, he might have taught at Louisiana State or maybe it's Tulane or somewhere over there.

00:13:08.341 --> 00:13:11.927
I'm not sure, but he had already been here several years when that

00:13:12.278 --> 00:13:17.024
About how big was the department when it was created, the faculty?

00:13:17.304 --> 00:13:17.725
Faculty.

00:13:17.745 --> 00:13:26.757
We had probably more faculty in that department than we'd had in the whole education and psychology faculty when I first came.

00:13:26.857 --> 00:13:30.361
We had probably about, maybe about eight.

00:13:31.843 --> 00:13:33.806
And the College of Education?

00:13:33.826 --> 00:13:35.448
And of course we were entirely graduate.

00:13:36.229 --> 00:13:38.792
We taught some courses for undergraduates

00:13:39.346 --> 00:13:43.252
in like psychology of learning and a few things like that.

00:13:43.333 --> 00:13:48.181
And I taught one test and measurement for undergraduate, but all of our majors were graduate students.

00:13:49.503 --> 00:13:51.967
And always have been.

00:13:52.728 --> 00:13:53.429
All right.

00:13:53.449 --> 00:14:01.202
As things got into high gear, describe the typical students in that program.

00:14:01.807 --> 00:14:04.252
Where did they, had they done their undergraduate?

00:14:04.693 --> 00:14:07.339
Where did they come from and so forth?

00:14:07.359 --> 00:14:18.904
Well, we, of course we got some of our own graduates, but we got them from all over Texas, every college in Texas.

00:14:18.884 --> 00:14:28.236
And it wasn't long before we were getting them from all around the United States and then we got some foreign students too, international students coming in.

00:14:28.817 --> 00:14:32.302
Were they experienced already in education?

00:14:32.963 --> 00:14:33.683
Often they were.

00:14:33.703 --> 00:14:43.997
Yes, they nearly all, of course they, well a few came in directly from

00:14:43.977 --> 00:14:46.924
previous graduate work into the doctoral program.

00:14:46.944 --> 00:14:57.230
But a typical student had been in some kind of educational work, teaching or some other education or administration or some other educational work for a few years at least.

00:14:57.772 --> 00:15:00.298
And some were middle-aged or

00:15:00.835 --> 00:15:08.045
It wasn't unusual for me in those about the first half of my career to have students older than I was.

00:15:08.946 --> 00:15:10.008
Then they started getting younger.

00:15:10.048 --> 00:15:20.563
Now were most of these that were experienced were coming out of elementary and secondary or were there some college?

00:15:20.603 --> 00:15:22.045
Some college all along.

00:15:22.525 --> 00:15:22.625
Okay.

00:15:22.645 --> 00:15:25.189
Just a mixture, quite a mixture it was.

00:15:25.996 --> 00:15:32.270
What other programs in the state were y'all like?

00:15:32.751 --> 00:15:43.414
I think we were, well of course we were like Texas a lot.

00:15:44.221 --> 00:15:47.645
some of the very same kinds of things that Texas had.

00:15:47.665 --> 00:15:49.568
I think North Texas.

00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:55.616
And East Texas had always been kind of strong in counseling.

00:15:56.617 --> 00:15:59.300
And they were kind of like we were.

00:16:01.163 --> 00:16:13.198
And of course, by that time, we had had a lot of experience in putting out counselors with master's degrees and some beyond master's degree, but not a doctoral program.

00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:16.021
Texas Tech.

00:16:18.584 --> 00:16:22.929
And I guess that was about it.

00:16:24.071 --> 00:16:24.471
Were there?

00:16:24.531 --> 00:16:27.896
I had lots of students, by the way, from Sam Houston.

00:16:27.916 --> 00:16:35.825
Not necessarily majoring with us, but taking my statistics courses and techniques of research and computer work and things like that.

00:16:37.367 --> 00:16:37.487
Right.

00:16:37.507 --> 00:16:43.675
As things were in high gear in the 70s and 80s, describe what it was like to

00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:53.964
What was a typical day or week like for a full-time, full professor in educational psychology?

00:16:54.885 --> 00:16:59.192
Well, like I said, I managed to get myself on lots of student committees.

00:17:00.214 --> 00:17:05.802
And there were times, especially in the summer, because we had a lot of students who would come for summer.

00:17:05.822 --> 00:17:07.445
They'd be doing other things during the year.

00:17:07.545 --> 00:17:09.147
So it was more so in the summer.

00:17:10.149 --> 00:17:12.312
It wouldn't be unusual for me to have

00:17:14.435 --> 00:17:22.286
It was not too unusual for me to have four, and not at all unusual for me to have three committee meetings a day, and they would be always two hours.

00:17:23.208 --> 00:17:30.238
So I would spend six to eight hours a day in committee meetings, hard on the bottom.

00:17:30.298 --> 00:17:33.102
Because this included such things as

00:17:34.364 --> 00:17:43.260
program planning with the committee, dissertation proposal, final exam, final exam for the master's students.

00:17:44.542 --> 00:17:47.507
And each one of those took two hours, no matter what you did.

00:17:47.868 --> 00:17:50.453
It always take up the whole full two hours.

00:17:51.294 --> 00:17:53.859
And you're also teaching how much?

00:17:55.061 --> 00:17:58.026
In the summer, I usually was teaching six hours.

00:17:58.006 --> 00:18:02.739
No, I was teaching, yeah, that's right, six hours, three hours each term.

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:05.847
In those days, earlier, I was teaching more.

00:18:06.268 --> 00:18:08.374
And then in those days, in the long semester, how much?

00:18:08.394 --> 00:18:10.420
I'd be teaching nine semester hours.

00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:12.505
Three preps, three different preparations?

00:18:13.347 --> 00:18:14.310
Yes, usually.

00:18:15.218 --> 00:18:19.268
And so you'd get to campus at about what time?

00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:21.614
Take me through a typical day.

00:18:21.795 --> 00:18:23.479
I always arrived before 8.

00:18:24.321 --> 00:18:25.805
Never was any parking problem either.

00:18:26.808 --> 00:18:31.540
And not much before 8, but I was always here at 8.

00:18:32.313 --> 00:18:36.278
I always took off some time in the middle of the day to go to the gym.

00:18:36.539 --> 00:18:39.863
I did that throughout the time here, and I still do.

00:18:39.883 --> 00:18:40.784
And what did you do?

00:18:40.824 --> 00:18:43.308
Most of the time we played badminton.

00:18:43.328 --> 00:18:43.488
With?

00:18:44.569 --> 00:18:53.161
Charles McCandless and Carl Landis and Lynn Hanna and Jim Melton and Ed McWilliams.

00:18:54.122 --> 00:18:55.584
Singles, doubles, or what?

00:18:55.604 --> 00:18:56.765
Yes, both of those.

00:18:56.785 --> 00:18:57.586
Both?

00:18:57.606 --> 00:18:57.947
Mixed.

00:18:58.287 --> 00:18:59.569
Who was your favorite partner?

00:19:03.211 --> 00:19:12.765
Well, during many of those years, and especially later, Len Hanna was my best friend.

00:19:13.546 --> 00:19:20.376
And we played millions of badminton games and got to be real good friends on other bases, too, finally.

00:19:21.157 --> 00:19:24.342
By the way, Monday was the fourth anniversary of his death.

00:19:24.659 --> 00:19:28.108
He was in entomology department, 10 years older than I am.

00:19:28.709 --> 00:19:32.619
And of course, Charles McCandless, he taught me quite a bit about playing.

00:19:32.679 --> 00:19:35.166
And Barney Welch played with us some.

00:19:35.286 --> 00:19:37.993
And Carl Landis played with us.

00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:43.616
Now, this was over in an old... G. Raleigh White on the third floor.

00:19:43.736 --> 00:19:44.898
Oh, it was in G. Raleigh.

00:19:44.918 --> 00:19:47.120
Until the new rec center was built.

00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:48.262
And then we moved over there.

00:19:48.282 --> 00:19:51.125
And we're still, I'm still, but I'm not playing now.

00:19:51.145 --> 00:19:53.247
I have knee surgery.

00:19:53.327 --> 00:19:57.753
In those years, normally, what time of day did you do that?

00:19:58.293 --> 00:20:01.717
I would take off, I would try to not have any appointment before two.

00:20:02.658 --> 00:20:06.883
And I would be over there, you know, on the way over there and on the way back or showering.

00:20:07.218 --> 00:20:09.081
or playing from twelve to two.

00:20:10.023 --> 00:20:15.653
One time I asked Len, did he remember where he was when Kennedy was shot?

00:20:15.854 --> 00:20:19.921
He said, I was the same place you were, playing badminton on the third floor of G. Riley White.

00:20:20.362 --> 00:20:22.305
We learned about it after we got it back on the street.

00:20:24.970 --> 00:20:27.775
Oh, another partner of mine was Tony Sorenson.

00:20:28.075 --> 00:20:30.798
He died young.

00:20:31.439 --> 00:20:37.206
Now of your close group of badminton players, who was the best?

00:20:39.149 --> 00:20:42.353
Who was the best, the hardest to beat?

00:20:43.174 --> 00:20:49.061
Okay, well Charles McCandless was really an excellent player, a real good, best player.

00:20:50.242 --> 00:20:57.171
And later on, a little later than that, I don't know if you know, Cheryl Smith in chemistry.

00:20:57.708 --> 00:20:58.610
Real good player.

00:20:58.650 --> 00:21:01.294
And then we always had some Asian students that would play with us.

00:21:02.116 --> 00:21:07.485
And they were, the ones that played with us were very good.

00:21:07.525 --> 00:21:09.789
They go in for badminton more in Asia than they do here.

00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:11.953
And I was pretty good too, Haskell.

00:21:12.093 --> 00:21:13.916
Okay.

00:21:13.936 --> 00:21:16.881
You got to the campus by eight.

00:21:17.047 --> 00:21:20.312
in your teaching class and then in your office?

00:21:20.332 --> 00:21:29.227
I would go home about 5 o'clock, unless I had a night class, and then I stayed on until after 8 p.m. What about lunch?

00:21:29.347 --> 00:21:30.028
Where'd you eat lunch?

00:21:32.152 --> 00:21:32.893
I usually didn't.

00:21:33.454 --> 00:21:33.955
Really?

00:21:34.916 --> 00:21:40.405
I just, but I maintained a large body weight all that time.

00:21:40.857 --> 00:21:43.003
I just ate a lot when I finally did get home.

00:21:44.587 --> 00:21:48.758
I usually kept some things like, you remember Metrical?

00:21:50.022 --> 00:21:51.225
I had some of those wafers.

00:21:51.305 --> 00:21:55.356
And I would eat things like that.

00:21:55.977 --> 00:21:58.100
No, I didn't eat lunch, no.

00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:01.625
So you got a typical weekday you'd get home what time?

00:22:02.627 --> 00:22:04.990
About 6 o'clock, 5.30 to 6 o'clock.

00:22:06.492 --> 00:22:08.535
Didn't do much work at home.

00:22:10.178 --> 00:22:11.440
Usually, sometimes I had to.

00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:14.704
So evening after supper you could relax.

00:22:15.025 --> 00:22:16.667
That's right.

00:22:16.687 --> 00:22:18.049
There were times when I couldn't.

00:22:19.131 --> 00:22:25.360
When children were growing up, when they were in junior and senior high, what did family do for enjoyment?

00:22:27.989 --> 00:22:34.396
We stayed at home most of the time.

00:22:34.496 --> 00:22:35.498
We were all readers.

00:22:36.138 --> 00:22:39.682
We would sit around and read and tell each other what we were reading.

00:22:41.004 --> 00:22:42.466
We watched TV quite a bit.

00:22:45.309 --> 00:22:46.370
Movies, picnicking?

00:22:47.071 --> 00:22:48.392
Some of that, yes.

00:22:48.412 --> 00:22:49.313
We weren't big on that.

00:22:49.994 --> 00:22:52.237
What kinds of vacations were you all able to work on?

00:22:52.257 --> 00:22:53.718
We had very few vacations.

00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:57.743
During a lot of this time, my wife was in poor health.

00:22:58.027 --> 00:23:01.551
which she still is, and it was hard for her to travel.

00:23:02.071 --> 00:23:06.155
And that contributed to our not being on vacation.

00:23:07.196 --> 00:23:10.239
Of course, my teaching 12 months a year contributed to that, too.

00:23:11.461 --> 00:23:17.026
What would you... We visited family in Waco quite a bit.

00:23:18.768 --> 00:23:27.797
What evaluation would you give in hindsight of the A&M Consolidated School District while your children, based on the years they were there?

00:23:28.267 --> 00:23:30.810
Well, I was entirely satisfied with it.

00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:32.832
I would agree with you.

00:23:32.852 --> 00:23:36.596
And I think the Bryan School District has been good most of the time, too.

00:23:37.617 --> 00:23:42.682
I have two grandchildren that are now in Bryan High School and have gone all through the Bryan Schools.

00:23:43.003 --> 00:23:46.006
And I think they have an excellent education.

00:23:48.589 --> 00:23:56.637
Did you go to, back in those years when the kids were at home, did you all go to football, basketball games?

00:23:57.967 --> 00:24:04.938
Not until they got kind of older, and then by then they were doing other things, so didn't do too much.

00:24:05.118 --> 00:24:06.240
Never did do much of that.

00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:08.503
Some, but never did do much of that.

00:24:09.985 --> 00:24:14.012
Were you part, was commencement normal for you to attend?

00:24:14.372 --> 00:24:17.016
No, I usually found a way out of that.

00:24:18.338 --> 00:24:20.802
In fact, a lot of years, when it was compulsory,

00:24:21.457 --> 00:24:27.746
I got a job in the registrar's office of helping them line up, and then I left.

00:24:28.828 --> 00:24:30.490
So I was kind of a shirker on that.

00:24:31.331 --> 00:24:36.879
Oh, describe registration, academic registration in the olden days.

00:24:36.899 --> 00:24:38.341
Oh, that was amazing.

00:24:38.622 --> 00:24:40.204
I really missed that.

00:24:41.005 --> 00:24:45.491
But we would all be in one big room, either Duncan Hall or Sabeza Hall.

00:24:46.433 --> 00:24:48.055
Every department would have a table.

00:24:49.064 --> 00:24:55.457
And people would come around, and they would register for your courses, and it would all be done by hand.

00:24:55.477 --> 00:25:03.532
It was on punch cards, but that was a really amazing day.

00:25:03.793 --> 00:25:08.001
And it was all done in one day, or half a day.

00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:14.506
And they would just go around and pick up their cards for the classes they want to register.

00:25:15.127 --> 00:25:28.707
And if you had any questions from one department to another about prerequisites or something like that or the qualifications for a person to enroll in a course, you'd just yell across there, hey, can this guy get in a history course or something like that.

00:25:30.210 --> 00:25:31.411
Did it work?

00:25:31.792 --> 00:25:32.473
Did it function?

00:25:33.254 --> 00:25:33.955
It did work.

00:25:34.596 --> 00:25:35.357
It was chaos.

00:25:35.417 --> 00:25:37.541
I mean, it seemed like chaos, but it did work.

00:25:37.681 --> 00:25:38.562
And it was all over.

00:25:39.352 --> 00:25:39.753
quickly.

00:25:40.175 --> 00:25:46.434
See, I wonder if it didn't work better than today's computer system because there was real communication.

00:25:46.534 --> 00:25:48.079
Yeah, it worked real well.

00:25:48.481 --> 00:25:50.625
It was kind of a social equation.

00:25:50.665 --> 00:25:54.572
It was about the only time that you got together with faculty from other departments.

00:25:54.612 --> 00:25:59.180
You weren't exactly together with them, but you were in the same room with them and you'd see them.

00:25:59.581 --> 00:26:03.789
In your department, what faculty members were expected to be a part of registration?

00:26:04.330 --> 00:26:05.271
I think we all did it.

00:26:05.732 --> 00:26:10.801
We took shifts, but I think every one of us did it.

00:26:10.821 --> 00:26:12.244
And of course the students

00:26:13.523 --> 00:26:27.910
were, some of them were new and they were more confused than we were and they would be looking for, I remember one time somebody stopped by our station and asked, where do you sign up for religion?

00:26:29.012 --> 00:26:32.258
And Warble looked around and said, God only knows.

00:26:33.385 --> 00:26:34.726
Very good.

00:26:34.746 --> 00:26:35.307
Very good.

00:26:37.589 --> 00:26:47.500
During those years when everything was in high gear in the 70s, 80s, early 90s, what was your favorite course to teach?

00:26:48.321 --> 00:26:49.822
The beginning course in statistics.

00:26:50.963 --> 00:26:52.445
That was my favorite.

00:26:52.665 --> 00:26:53.346
Undergraduate?

00:26:53.806 --> 00:26:56.409
It was undergraduate, but lots of graduate students took it.

00:26:57.750 --> 00:27:00.253
Lots of graduate students did take it.

00:27:01.718 --> 00:27:04.464
As many graduates or more graduates than there were undergraduates.

00:27:05.205 --> 00:27:07.630
And they were from a wide variety of majors?

00:27:07.871 --> 00:27:08.552
Yes, they were.

00:27:08.592 --> 00:27:18.913
And over the years, describe the quality of the students that took it.

00:27:18.974 --> 00:27:21.178
Did it go up, down, sideways, or what?

00:27:21.496 --> 00:27:22.317
stayed the same.

00:27:23.039 --> 00:27:30.632
They were all totally ignorant of statistics when they came in and I taught them something but I didn't notice any real differences, real changes.

00:27:31.393 --> 00:27:36.723
I mentioned a while ago I did notice, did seem to notice a little improvement when women came in.

00:27:36.743 --> 00:27:39.548
I would apply that to statistics also.

00:27:39.568 --> 00:27:45.478
I mean it's just the overall, I believe their interest in academics started to

00:27:46.943 --> 00:27:49.587
and maybe a little competitiveness started coming in.

00:27:49.607 --> 00:27:50.869
But it wasn't a great factor.

00:27:50.909 --> 00:27:53.072
We always had good students.

00:27:53.653 --> 00:27:56.036
Did the students create a nickname for that course?

00:27:56.236 --> 00:27:57.598
Some courses had a nickname.

00:27:58.239 --> 00:28:00.563
Was there?

00:28:00.583 --> 00:28:06.331
Well, no, not that.

00:28:06.371 --> 00:28:08.054
But they did joke about it quite a bit.

00:28:08.294 --> 00:28:14.503
And let me see.

00:28:15.479 --> 00:28:31.986
I was always emphasizing the concept of significant figures in calculation, probably beat that horse to death, but a lot of people referred to me as, said, Dr. Barker, if you had

00:28:31.966 --> 00:28:38.459
call name on the radio, he'd be the significant figure.

00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:41.546
Maybe I'd be the last to know though if they had a nickname for it.

00:28:42.628 --> 00:28:45.293
Describe how you actually taught the course.

00:28:45.835 --> 00:28:49.682
Were you standing, sitting, walking, standing still, what?

00:28:50.665 --> 00:28:53.350
In that particular course I was always standing.

00:28:54.055 --> 00:28:58.540
I always had a piece of chalk in my hand, and I did use a blackboard quite a bit.

00:28:58.961 --> 00:29:02.665
But even if I didn't, just in case, I had the chalk with me.

00:29:04.027 --> 00:29:12.176
And I asked a lot of questions, but they were rhetorical questions.

00:29:12.757 --> 00:29:15.700
But I did try to anticipate what the questions would be.

00:29:16.661 --> 00:29:20.586
And of course, I did have a lot of real questions too.

00:29:23.485 --> 00:29:30.114
I guess I would be in motion quite a bit.

00:29:30.534 --> 00:29:32.336
I wouldn't stay in exactly the same place.

00:29:33.077 --> 00:29:39.766
I had hardly any notes in that course, especially after I'd taught it about a million times, you know.

00:29:40.627 --> 00:29:47.076
And I didn't stay in one place necessarily, but I didn't constantly move either.

00:29:48.718 --> 00:29:52.783
But I moved to the chalkboard a lot.

00:29:53.422 --> 00:29:59.669
Had a lot of dry cleaning bells on my suits from all that chalk.

00:30:01.932 --> 00:30:04.515
Normally, how were you dressed?

00:30:04.535 --> 00:30:11.484
I always wore a tie, and I almost always wore a jacket, sport jacket of some kind.

00:30:11.924 --> 00:30:15.408
Not always pressed too well, but I wore a coat and tie.

00:30:16.149 --> 00:30:21.015
In the summer, I would usually wear a short-sleeved shirt and a tie.

00:30:21.890 --> 00:30:23.012
Did you give them any?

00:30:23.032 --> 00:30:25.315
But I was about the last to do it, you know.

00:30:26.777 --> 00:30:32.825
Did you give the students any guidelines as to how you expected them to behave in class?

00:30:34.988 --> 00:30:42.659
Well, not so much behave, but I was very specific about what the content would be.

00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:51.171
In fact, I gave them homework assignments that were the same as the test from previous years.

00:30:51.674 --> 00:31:03.697
And I found out that there were immense files of those available on campus, lots more than I had, you know, thousands of former previous tests.

00:31:03.717 --> 00:31:07.585
And since I knew they had them, you know, some had them, I wanted them all to have them.

00:31:07.605 --> 00:31:11.252
So I issued to students when they were going to be having a test,

00:31:11.806 --> 00:31:18.480
I gave them something just like the next test they're going to take, except the words are different and the numbers are different.

00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:20.884
The music's different.

00:31:21.085 --> 00:31:24.111
And I even had students frequently ask, may I have some
