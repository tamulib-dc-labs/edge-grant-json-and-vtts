WEBVTT

00:03.963 --> 00:05.225
Let's back up, though. You start the first grade, 
and where was the school? What school did you

00:11.993 --> 00:13.855
attend, and where was it? It was in

00:14.676 --> 00:28.913
the big old building.

00:28.933 --> 00:29.654
I don't need a map. But it was on campus. Yeah, right 
there by the By the pavilion? Well, down from the

00:37.080 --> 00:38.562
pavilion. Let's see.

00:46.011 --> 00:52.959
Well,

00:46.011 --> 00:52.959
see, this was a quality road right here. Like that. 
You got up here and you went that way and you went in

00:54.381 --> 01:00.028
behind the academic building. Okay. And this 
built a road right here. Mm-hmm. It's the last

01:03.093 --> 01:05.035
building on this side. One, there's another one 
right there beside it. One of them was for the, I

01:08.278 --> 01:17.107
think, for the extension service, and one was for 
the... Now, I remember where Old Science Hall was.

01:17.187 --> 01:18.007
Was it near that? Old Science Hall. Mm-hmm. The red 
brick building tore down about 40 years ago? No,

01:25.415 --> 01:26.676
there were two. I think they're still standing. 
Okay. About how many first graders were there

01:29.439 --> 01:32.982
year-to-year?

01:35.425 --> 01:42.075
They was, oh,

01:35.425 --> 01:42.075
I guess they were about 25. Now, and were they from 
all across this south part of the county, or were

01:42.095 --> 01:48.525
they only from the campus? No, they brought in the 
ones from the south.

01:58.239 --> 02:01.103
There were farms all through this area, see? And 
those kids walked to school. What was the name of

02:04.214 --> 02:08.258
the, was it the A&M Consolidated School then? What 
was the name of it? Well, you see, that's where,

02:09.759 --> 02:15.504
that's what happened.

02:16.785 --> 02:21.109
It was not a consolidated thing.

02:22.170 --> 02:33.640
The state had laws for school districts like that, 
but the A&M campus was not a school district. Okay.

02:34.454 --> 02:44.326
And the A&M, the budget of the A&M campus gave so 
much money to this combination of school

02:34.454 --> 02:44.326
districts. It was just a, it was just an 
association. It wasn't, it was legalized by what

02:53.217 --> 03:03.550
the legislature gave the college to give to the 
school districts. Were all 11 grades in the same

03:03.918 --> 03:07.843
building? Not then. So you had an elementary 
building and a high school? No, we had no schools.

03:16.032 --> 03:18.495
No, I mean on the campus. Well, we had no schools. 
They were on the campus, but they were in various

03:22.680 --> 03:26.685
buildings. Oh, okay. Now, where did the teachers 
come from? They hired them. But they live on

03:32.231 --> 03:33.773
campus? Uh, yeah, they did, they did. They, uh,

03:39.287 --> 04:03.388
I don't know about those, the younger, I know that, 
um,

03:39.287 --> 04:03.388
Ethel Waldron, who was the oldest girl, she told me 
one time that, uh, she was in that same building

04:03.655 --> 04:10.222
that I was in, right on the corner. Later on, they 
built a white building down here, straight down

04:10.242 --> 04:19.092
south of that. I think they later called it the 
Music Hall or something like that.

04:26.521 --> 04:29.864
Now they built that building, this wooden 
building. And they built that, and when they did,

04:33.558 --> 04:37.123
they started having us at the regular school. So 
you got up and walked a short distance from where

04:38.045 --> 04:46.297
you lived to the school. Dad took me. Dad carried us 
in a car. Really? Yeah. I had two sisters, too. As

04:57.234 --> 04:59.397
you think about it now and look back, What was the 
quality of the elementary grades you took here on

05:00.001 --> 05:05.430
campus, the first few grades? Was it a good school?

05:10.137 --> 05:13.462
Yes, I guess it was for what they did. I mean, it was 
all right. My problem was the fact that

05:17.188 --> 05:26.042
I had astigmatism and I couldn't read. I'm also a 
dialectic.

05:31.391 --> 05:35.176
I don't know right from left. And so I was always, 
they were always waking me up or doing something, I

05:35.196 --> 05:45.632
don't know, yelling at me. It didn't make any 
difference. But we got an education. We got a good

05:51.761 --> 05:53.003
education. In the elementary years, who were some 
of your closest buddies? Lucian Morgan,

05:58.152 --> 06:03.839
Charles Ritchie. Ritchie? Ritchie. Ritchie. He 
was head of the Civil Engineering Department. And

06:16.915 --> 06:19.418
Dean Bolton, he had a boy. And the FAPS boy, he died. 
That's the only one I ever saw that was dead at that

06:24.524 --> 06:27.147
time. But they had, and the Billsies had two boys, 
and one of them died. What kind of mischief did you

06:34.463 --> 06:37.486
little boys create? What'd y'all do for pranks? 
Oh, there's a, the chemistry department had a

06:40.650 --> 06:55.024
building, a tin building, right back here, behind 
me, between the, the old chemistry building And

06:55.662 --> 06:58.386
the Aggie Engineering Building. The Aggie 
Engineering Building had a lawn on the front of it.

07:03.392 --> 07:05.936
And it had a filling station over on the right here. 
But we would come up there and they had some men

07:07.578 --> 07:20.395
working in there and we'd take a rock and throw up 
there and hit it with a tin roof, you know, and they

07:07.578 --> 07:20.395
were working there. I guess they got used to it. Oh, 
you were just always around someplace. Another

07:30.405 --> 07:38.855
thing too, there were some old World War I 
trenches.

07:41.818 --> 07:43.420
You never heard this story before. There were some 
old World War I trenches that we played in. Where

07:49.447 --> 07:50.188
were they?

07:54.033 --> 08:00.381
Going towards College Park, you know, there's a 
dip there. Well, they're building that gully. And

08:06.069 --> 08:11.836
they were just like the pictures in it that we're 
showing on TV today. Did they use them for

08:13.859 --> 08:15.080
training? I guess they would have. So you all 
played in those trenches? Yeah. Yeah, we played in

08:21.329 --> 08:22.470
those. Did y'all ever make any noise in the 
academic buildings, you little boys? Our

08:28.980 --> 08:50.761
biggest, or what we did, was

08:28.980 --> 08:50.761
taking, at the end of the semester, they had a

08:28.980 --> 08:50.761
requirement that you had to clean your room and 
leave it in good order. The students? Yes,

08:51.922 --> 08:53.183
students. through the hall. We went down those 
halls. I walked home with enough alarm clocks.

09:05.277 --> 09:07.320
And I'd take them apart. The other thing was that

09:08.862 --> 09:21.060
they had those old coal

09:08.862 --> 09:21.060
hot stoves. Brown coal oil stoves? Well, there 
were usually about four. Oh, okay. There were four

09:29.381 --> 09:30.682
burners. They had this big old jar sitting up on the 
end. And so then they would,

09:34.948 --> 09:42.077
I'd go get those. I don't know how I got them home, 
but I'd get two or three of those and I'd take them

09:53.069 --> 09:57.175
We'd throw them in the garbage after I got through 
Pink Park. Just take all the screws out of them. And

10:02.842 --> 10:17.241
then

10:02.842 --> 10:17.241
my father got me an eighth-inch

10:02.842 --> 10:17.241
pipe. He got me 12-inch lengths of eighth-inch 
pipe. elbows, some tees, some caps, some

10:23.815 --> 10:44.794
couplings, and he got that from, and I remember 
when he brought it home, and he said, mother, you

10:23.815 --> 10:44.794
got some of my lye? And she said, yeah. And so they 
took a big old pan, set it up on that big range, and

10:53.853 --> 10:59.023
filled it with water and he dumped all those in 
there. He cleaned all the grease off of them. I

11:01.287 --> 11:04.192
haven't got pieces of those in my farm yet. You 
could scroll together like this. And then there

11:09.703 --> 11:16.435
was another one later on was a little what's called 
a rector's set. You remember all those? We had

11:21.838 --> 11:23.400
those. We didn't have a lot of toys, but we didn't 
have any

11:23.420 --> 11:37.792
radio, TV, or anything. The first time I ever heard 
of radio was in 1926. Do you remember, did your

11:42.817 --> 11:46.860
father buy radio then, or what was the occasion? 
Occasionally we went down to the Bentley's

11:47.785 --> 12:01.541
apartment on South Bryan Street, about where 
Connolly's is today. There was a house in there and

12:02.823 --> 12:05.586
they were renting that house. He was, Bentley was 
one of our professors there. And that's the first

12:11.393 --> 12:13.495
time I ever heard a radio. We sat there and listened 
to it. Now you had a different society, your

12:17.924 --> 12:22.771
society was entirely different too. Sure. You 
had, you had heads of the departments, you had

12:24.774 --> 12:45.366
professors that were working, which in there, 
well I guess you, like the Air Force, or like the

12:24.774 --> 12:45.366
Army, you never, we never did go see some of the 
help. They had people, white people, who did a lot

12:46.595 --> 12:55.947
of work for us. And they had a lot of Negro people, 
too. While you were a little kid, elementary

12:59.591 --> 13:08.563
school, where did your mother in those years, 
where did she buy her groceries? From Luke and

13:10.225 --> 13:12.227
Charlie's. Luke and Charlie's? Yeah, Luke and 
Charlie's. Where was that? Northgate. Okay, how

13:17.941 --> 13:19.743
big was it? It serviced the whole college. Is that 
right? And did they deliver for her? Yeah. Now

13:26.811 --> 13:31.376
you're saying L-U-K-E, Luke, Luke and Charlie.

13:35.820 --> 13:41.246
It's Luke,

13:35.820 --> 13:41.246
I think it's Luke Patronella. Okay. And I don't 
remember what the, or Charlie was his last name.

13:48.331 --> 13:51.154
And then occasionally, and then to buy other 
things. The bill, the mother ran there about $75 a

13:51.654 --> 13:56.539
month. And then would you go down, would the family 
go downtown, Brian, for shopping, other

13:57.700 --> 14:03.106
shopping? A little. But Dad loved to take us 
downtown. He's We'd go down there across from the,

14:13.872 --> 14:28.046
where the LaSalle, the Marisco building, on that 
street there, on the corner, right there on the

14:13.872 --> 14:28.046
corner across the street. The Watkins men sat 
right there on the corner. He had a, he had a, that

14:32.611 --> 14:41.199
with all

14:32.611 --> 14:41.199
those pharmaceuticals. And he was there. Then the 
Negroes, they had a wagon yard where the food town

14:44.618 --> 14:55.033
is today, down on North Main Street. That was a 
wagon yard. And they came in here on Saturday

14:56.995 --> 14:59.078
night. On Saturday, they came in on Saturday. From 
out in the country? Out in the country, all over.

15:06.629 --> 15:09.353
They'd drive a wagon in there. And I guess they 
drove it home afterwards or something or

15:09.373 --> 15:13.258
something. Or maybe they stayed there. I don't 
know. But they'd always coming out through there.

15:19.781 --> 15:24.047
And then there was white people in there and 
everybody else in there. And Dad loved to just sit

15:24.067 --> 15:28.172
there and watch those people. What was the big... 
Was there any big department store downtown? Dry

15:33.260 --> 15:34.201
goods store? Oh, yeah. Edges. Edges. Okay. And...

15:41.291 --> 15:41.992
I don't know. What's the name? I don't know. A.M. 
Waldrop? A.M. Waldrop, yeah, they were there.

15:51.097 --> 15:58.890
Waldrop's were there, and Edges, well, they 
always got a lot of stuff from there. And Lester's

15:59.431 --> 16:02.035
later on came in. How often did the family, or your 
mom and dad at least, how often did they go to

16:02.055 --> 16:08.466
Houston or Dallas? Well, uh, In the first few 
years, we went to Houston. We would... Would you go

16:22.756 --> 16:24.899
by train or car? No, we went by car. It was a rough 
trip. It took about four hours. Three or four

16:32.648 --> 16:34.150
hours. We used to buy stuff at... Foley's? No, 
Foley one day. Oh. It was there.

16:45.646 --> 16:55.196
They

16:45.646 --> 16:55.196
used to buy me clothes

16:45.646 --> 16:55.196
there.

16:56.538 --> 16:59.100
It was a store right downtown on Main Street. And we 
went there and they bought me pants that looked

16:59.881 --> 17:09.391
like jodhpurs. And that's all I wore for a long 
time. And then

17:16.122 --> 17:24.269
my father was head of the Ag Engineering 
Department. He had to take care of the entire Ag

17:24.289 --> 17:28.673
Engineering Department. So then the Hardware

17:28.693 --> 17:45.167
Implement Association in Texas, came to the 
college and says, can you get us a man to run this

17:46.177 --> 17:58.394
organization?

17:58.415 --> 18:00.477
So they asked Dad to do it. And yeah, that was when 
that was. And so he took the job on them. They paid

18:13.516 --> 18:15.559
him an honorarium. I think it was something in the 
early days of about $100 a month. In addition to

18:21.474 --> 18:23.717
his... Salary. To his campus responsibilities.

18:28.123 --> 18:32.568
And they gave him a... Did that cause him to travel 
much? Oh, a lot of times. A lot of times. He

18:37.615 --> 18:38.096
traveled. And

18:38.576 --> 18:46.086
the reason I remember that, that far back, One day 
we were going, and I went with him. He was having a

18:51.851 --> 18:58.800
series of meetings in Waco. And so we drove up 
there. I know we were driving there in that 21

19:05.468 --> 19:09.713
Dodge. It took us four hours to get up there. All 
gravel roads. like that. And so he, he says, son you

19:19.210 --> 19:27.241
gotta have a pair of long pants.

19:27.261 --> 19:31.787
So we went to Cox's in Waco. He bought me a pair of 
long pants. That was the first time I'd ever had a

19:33.850 --> 19:41.020
pair of long pants.

19:41.040 --> 19:42.482
That would be in I would say it was about 1924 or 
something like that. That's about when that was.

19:52.701 --> 20:02.473
But his job as Secretary and Treasurer of the 
Hardware Association, I traveled with him a lot.

20:03.374 --> 20:12.705
What were the primary implement companies that 
were supplying farm implements in those days? Oh,

20:13.124 --> 20:14.406
IEC. International Harvester. John Deere.

20:22.518 --> 20:22.898
Ford. Ford had some things, not that far back. The 
first Ford was about 1937. Yeah, but was Farmall

20:31.891 --> 20:35.837
back in the early 20s? No. I thought they were 
later, too. When I was teaching, I taught at

20:40.512 --> 20:51.403
Tarleton in 35, 37, and the only one I had was IHC, it 
was a hormone. Ford came on a year later, but the

20:52.164 --> 21:05.397
Ford had a lift on the back, which makes it, even 
today, my son has one of them. We still keep it in

21:05.417 --> 21:07.920
Kipropa. Were there, were there farm tractors in 
the 20s? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Uh, the college got two

21:16.133 --> 21:35.140
oil pools, and then we got one of them stuck out 
here, uh, right across from about where their

21:16.133 --> 21:35.140
farm, uh,

21:16.133 --> 21:35.140
you know, Where you get flowers and stuff there. A 
horticulture center? No, right there on Old

21:40.600 --> 21:43.744
College Road. Oh, oh, oh. A student was driving and 
he lost it and he ran off in a big ditch. We had a hell

21:52.235 --> 21:54.678
of a time pulling that thing out of there. And then 
they got an aviary, which is big. I like the aviary

21:59.865 --> 22:01.867
better. It's an easy start. Were Texas farmers 
using, that didn't have tractors, did they use

22:04.229 --> 22:10.456
horses or mules? Which did they use most? For 
plowing and... Down here, probably with mules.

22:18.644 --> 22:19.945
Mules, mm-hmm. What they had, horses. Up north, 
you never, you very seldom saw mules. Now, another

22:27.033 --> 22:29.055
thing about mules is that you put a pair of mules 
together and one of them dies, you got it. The other

22:38.582 --> 22:41.166
one won't make up. I don't know why that is, but 
that's the truth. And we had one, the college had a

22:46.694 --> 22:58.671
stallion, a horse stallion out of a mule. which 
college has, I understand it somewhere. But I used

23:05.640 --> 23:08.424
to, I used him in 37. When I came back in 37, I brought 
a horse with me then. I built a trailer and brought a

23:16.233 --> 23:20.538
horse with me. And we used to take him over there. 
This is right over here was the horse barn. You know

23:26.926 --> 23:27.546
that? The pavilion. No. The little one right 
beside it. Oh, yes, yes. That's a horse bar. The old

23:33.997 --> 23:37.863
pavilion is still there. And then the... Where the 
golf course is now was the cow pasture. And then

23:44.072 --> 23:46.695
north of that... All of it was cow pasture. Oh, all 
of that was cow pasture. And then the roads out

23:50.581 --> 23:53.325
there, there wasn't any roads out there. They were 
just open pasture where the veterinary people

23:53.345 --> 23:59.033
kept their stock In the early 20s, the first years 
your family was here, where did you all go to

23:59.570 --> 24:03.695
church? Gone home. And did just about the whole 
campus attend? Yeah. Now, who did the sermon?

24:14.967 --> 24:15.808
Reverend Matthews. What denomination was he? I 
don't know. Was there Sunday school? Sunday

24:21.554 --> 24:22.235
school. We went to Sunday school. And I was in the 
class with Dr. Reed, who was head of the poultry

24:24.297 --> 24:28.682
department. Were there any churches at what we now 
call Northgate in the 20s? They started up then.

24:38.613 --> 24:39.634
They started up then. What were the first ones that 
you remember? The Methodists and the Baptists.

24:47.723 --> 24:48.985
The Baptists were later. But the first church, the 
tabernacle back there, was built by the

24:49.946 --> 24:55.072
Methodists. It is a big old tabernacle. It's a very 
big old thing. I mean, it wasn't, it had windows in

25:00.033 --> 25:16.999
it, of course, but it was just a really,

25:00.033 --> 25:16.999
and I had to help get the sewer line in there. And my 
father did a lot of that work for these people

25:17.019 --> 25:27.475
around here, but he had several

25:30.897 --> 25:36.185
students

25:30.897 --> 25:36.185
that were quite competent. One was . I worked for 
him. We dug a trench across the, from that old

25:43.155 --> 25:53.690
tabernacle, which is right there, where the 
church is now, across that street right there. And

25:54.992 --> 25:58.638
it went back into the college system down here 
somewhere. I don't know just where it went. You

26:00.833 --> 26:02.555
know, that didn't bother me. When I had to crawl in 
those things and check the grade on them, they

26:04.177 --> 26:18.413
thought, oh hell, I was a pretty good engineer 
before I was 12 years old. Now, when you arrived,

26:19.594 --> 26:29.085
the campus had its own power system already, and 
the sewer system or was on the campus. It had a sewer

26:32.260 --> 26:42.593
system which was mainly aligned to the

26:32.260 --> 26:42.593
to the Brandeis River. They pumped it out there and 
pumped it to the river. There's a pipeline down

26:46.798 --> 26:49.261
there someplace. Back to religion, were there 
many Catholic or Jewish people here then?

27:01.317 --> 27:07.766
They would have

27:01.317 --> 27:07.766
their meeting places on Sunday. The college 
opened up the buildings for them. Then you had a

27:13.794 --> 27:20.764
compulsory sermon for the students. What if they 
didn't attend? What happened? They were

27:24.348 --> 27:26.751
disciplined. See, you had a, you had a, just like 
you do today, the same thing with the Corps. You had

27:33.318 --> 27:42.749
a Corps commander for each company, and he was 
responsible to... For getting them there? I don't

27:42.769 --> 27:43.790
know. Well, he was responsible, yeah, for the 
training and also the And then you had, we had 16

27:53.339 --> 28:03.879
army officers here on campus, lived with us. Were 
there anyone, was there anyone on campus who had

28:05.783 --> 28:10.993
been a kind of a World War I hero?

28:13.724 --> 28:14.285
No. No, those people we had were real army, a real 
army or air. We didn't have any air force. We did

28:24.581 --> 28:26.204
have cavalry. And you see, here's what happened. 
They would assign an officer and his family to the

28:33.375 --> 28:41.588
college for four years. if he formed outright. And 
they could actually ask for the fifth year if they

28:45.908 --> 28:49.794
wanted to. And so I only saw one man that I know of 
that they pulled him off after one year because he

28:51.616 --> 29:06.376
was playing around. When Dr. Bezell went to the 
University of Oklahoma, who followed him? Did Is

29:11.335 --> 29:13.178
that when Walton became president? Yeah, I guess 
so. What kind of a president was he? Who, Walton?

29:18.808 --> 29:19.249
Mm-hmm. He was a good man. Good man. See, he was a man 
that could get up and talk to people. Mm-hmm. That

29:31.530 --> 29:37.039
is the most important part of a professor's life. 
His ability to talk and relate to people. Walton

29:42.467 --> 29:43.628
was great at it. His family was... I couldn't say 
much more. And... Oh, Ethel Walton, the oldest

29:52.081 --> 29:58.730
girl, married Burgess.

30:01.374 --> 30:04.579
And they formed what's called South Oakwood. and 
later they went and formed North Oakwood, which I

30:05.167 --> 30:10.435
have a home. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Oh, now, this is 
Herschel Burgess? Yeah. Mm-hmm. And where South

30:15.002 --> 30:22.112
Oakwood is now, when you got here, what was it, just 
open land? No, it belonged to the,

30:22.153 --> 30:30.866
it belonged to the Shoots. But was it just... It was 
a farm. A farm? They had a family down there that

30:33.989 --> 30:41.440
raised crops

30:33.989 --> 30:41.440
in the lower end of it. About when were those 
streets laid out? Well, the South Side

30:46.908 --> 30:57.043
Development Company, which is College Park,

30:46.908 --> 30:57.043
the Charter was granted in 1920 or 21. My father was 
a part of it. There was Dan Schultz, there was

31:07.550 --> 31:22.069
Lancaster, I don't remember what his first name 
was, Dr. Clark, and then there was Burgess, I mean

31:26.217 --> 31:38.717
There was Dorney, and then there was a

31:26.217 --> 31:38.717
man who was like Dr. Fraps. He was in Dr. Fraps's 
outfit.

31:46.009 --> 31:48.513
He buried over there. They formed a company and 
they bought that land.
