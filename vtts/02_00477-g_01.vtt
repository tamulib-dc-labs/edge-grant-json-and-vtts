WEBVTT

00:02.275 --> 00:15.808
We have a complaint here against you that you're 
going to have a closed court against the Fort

00:02.275 --> 00:15.808
Jackson Five, and I said, that's exactly right. I 
said, I thought all you people in Washington knew

00:16.408 --> 00:19.391
that. Well, they said, well, Secretary of Defense 
and Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public

00:20.452 --> 00:30.662
Affairs feels that it should be opened. I said, I 
guess you misunderstood me. I said, the court is

00:35.824 --> 00:45.336
closed, and if you want it open, you get yourself 
another boy down here to command this place.

00:46.077 --> 00:46.918
That's what you told him? That's what I told him. Of 
course, that was going back to the Secretary of

00:48.620 --> 00:50.923
Defense. That went back to the Secretary of 
Defense. The court remained closed.

01:00.174 --> 01:00.615
Well... They were all found guilty. Of what 
charge? For disrupting the military operations

01:06.999 --> 01:18.397
and for anti-communist activities within the 
armed forces. I mean for communist activities.

01:20.039 --> 01:21.021
Anti-American activities. Anti-American 
activities, yeah. And there were eight or ten

01:23.485 --> 01:25.368
charges on there. I don't remember now what it was. 
defiance of rules and standing order and

01:27.477 --> 01:34.205
regulation, misconduct, and so on and so forth 
like that in public places. And they were found

01:36.307 --> 01:44.417
guilty and given undesirable discharge or 
dishonorable discharges depending on the

01:36.307 --> 01:44.417
seriousness of each individual. And then they 
turned around and sued me in the federal courts for

01:45.478 --> 01:52.065
denying their rights on the First Amendment. And 
the Secretary of the Army and I were tried And this

01:56.468 --> 02:00.372
is the first case we tried in the federal courts. I 
was tried in the federal court along with the

02:02.695 --> 02:06.339
Secretary of the Army. And a federal court ruled 
that you could not operate a military force as a

02:08.021 --> 02:24.619
common ordinary

02:08.021 --> 02:24.619
civilian organization. from the standpoint of 
discipline and authority of the

02:24.953 --> 02:36.111
commander-in-chief,

02:24.953 --> 02:36.111
and that we were, the Secretary of the Army and I, 
were acquitted. And they appealed that. And we got

02:40.398 --> 02:48.732
a two-to-one vote in our favor in the Fourth 
Circuit Court in Richmond. And that was over with,

02:48.752 --> 02:51.096
and those guys were out. And believe it or not, one 
went to Massachusetts and ran for the Congress up

02:51.633 --> 03:07.067
there under the Socialist Workers Party and the 
head leader stayed in Georgia and ran for the

02:51.633 --> 03:07.067
Congress under the Social Workers Party of the 
First District of Washington. But that was an

03:09.069 --> 03:20.880
episode in my life where, you know,

03:22.565 --> 03:51.407
have got to stand up to what you believe in and be 
damned what the intent of your superiors might be

03:22.565 --> 03:51.407
from the standpoint of interfering with your 
responsibilities which you've been assigned to

03:22.565 --> 03:51.407
and by God when they do they either they either get 
in my view get somebody else to do the damn job or

03:22.565 --> 03:51.407
leave you alone. And they left me alone.

03:58.166 --> 03:59.468
But it set the example. The case set the example for 
the rest of the United States during this critical

03:59.508 --> 04:12.821
period of communist disruption and burning of 
buildings and total destruction, anarchy within

03:59.508 --> 04:12.821
a democracy. That's a hell of a thing to happen in a 
democracy, isn't it? God damn. Did you have any

04:23.602 --> 04:28.409
other examples of disorderly conduct? Out of the 
ordinary disorderly conduct?

04:34.519 --> 04:34.659
Oh. Or for the most part were they just the usual or 
the usual routine sort of thing?

04:49.202 --> 04:51.465
Nothing uncommon to everyday life. Did you ever, 
with these Fort Jackson Five, did you ever have any

04:51.665 --> 04:57.991
talks or discussion with them? No, no. Did you ever 
interview them? No, God no. Ask them what they were

05:02.335 --> 05:04.496
doing or why? No, no, no. Weren't you curious? 
Well, you get all that information anyway. You got

05:11.122 --> 05:17.768
ways and means of finding out all this 
information, you know.

05:18.989 --> 05:20.811
So you don't need to talk to them. You just don't, 
you never want to give a communist element the

05:23.255 --> 05:45.432
privilege

05:23.255 --> 05:45.432
of, of being honored with your presence, you see.

05:45.552 --> 05:48.958
So, that,

05:51.487 --> 06:00.837
You'd be surprised how many congressmen, how much 
support from the Congress you can get from a

05:51.487 --> 06:00.837
communist element in this country. What do you 
mean? A congressman writing you and saying, what

06:04.481 --> 06:10.027
are you doing to this fine young man? We've just 
heard that you locked up this fine young man.

06:16.754 --> 06:18.996
What's the matter with you? And what they're 
talking about is they're supporting a commie.

06:29.449 --> 06:29.730
See? And you say, well Jesus Christ, how in the hell 
can the people elect a joker like that to represent

06:31.292 --> 06:41.885
them in the United States Congress? Through 
ignorance? He was ignorant in the first place. He

06:47.732 --> 06:48.493
really didn't intend to support communism.

06:55.815 --> 06:58.979
Sometimes you feel like that they do, but I don't 
think they do.

07:04.485 --> 07:15.257
But it's the sort of thing that, that's the reason I 
asked you yesterday about what we had found at A&M

07:04.485 --> 07:15.257
back some time ago, what the indications were.

07:19.051 --> 07:25.358
Well, you left there in 1970 and you went up to 
command the entire Army in Alaska. What are the

07:27.461 --> 07:31.405
responsibilities up there? Responsibilities 
are to command about a division of, at that time,

07:31.425 --> 07:47.083
about a division of Arctic trained soldiers and 
Eskimo scouts. with intelligence activities

07:49.021 --> 08:17.290
scattered along that part of the front, along the 
barren straits, and to provide external security

07:49.021 --> 08:17.290
and support to internal police forces, and to 
train the soldiers in the art of winter warfare,

07:49.021 --> 08:17.290
skiing,

07:49.021 --> 08:17.290
glacier training on glacier ice, movement on the 
glaciers, mountain climbing, arctic scouting,

08:18.147 --> 08:42.433
the art of scouting, parachuting in toward the 
North Pole, and survival and recovery, and the use

08:18.147 --> 08:42.433
of helicopters and snowmobiles and other types of 
equipment. and most of your training you wait

08:44.658 --> 09:00.880
until the weather is minus fifty degrees for your 
winter exercises and you work very closely with

08:44.658 --> 09:00.880
the Canadian military and you exchange units back 
and forth. The exercise that I had during the

09:02.162 --> 09:13.517
winter of 1970 was for about six weeks in which I had 
a commando regiment airborne commando regiment

09:14.476 --> 09:17.879
out of Canada joined us. I had about five thousand 
in the exercise. They sent me about fifteen

09:21.903 --> 09:43.605
hundred and we were to experiment with the use of 
helicopters in air mobile operations during the

09:21.903 --> 09:43.605
heavy winter and the temperature had to be minus 
fifty to minus seventy-five in order for us to and

09:21.903 --> 09:43.605
we learned a tremendous amount about cold soaking 
of vehicles. We know that we only, at those

09:45.773 --> 09:55.326
temperatures, we only get about 10 minutes of work 
per hour out of a soldier. We know that we have a high

09:55.346 --> 10:11.550
number of casualties because you can't get them to 
go urinate or defecate because flesh burns, third

09:55.346 --> 10:11.550
degree burns, in 30 seconds at that temperature. 
We know that if you cut your helicopter off, it'll

10:12.290 --> 10:25.726
cold soak in 15 minutes to the point it'll take you 
two hours with Herman Nelson heaters in order to

10:12.290 --> 10:25.726
get it to where it'll start again. So you never turn 
off the engine, you see, helicopter engine, when

10:25.786 --> 10:34.856
you're flying out in the field. We know that the 
commanding general designed his own uniform.

10:39.542 --> 10:42.145
That's me in the uniform Wade less than four pounds 
while he survived at minus 75. The soldiers had to

10:48.434 --> 10:55.261
have 96 pounds of clothing on to survive at that 
temperature. Why? Was it a different material?

10:57.002 --> 10:59.465
Yes, totally different material. I designed this 
uniform. It was a two-piece form-fitting

11:02.148 --> 11:07.693
goose-down underwear. with zippers all over the 
place so you know you can without taking it off and

11:07.910 --> 11:14.136
without exposure. Followed by a wind-resistant 
piece of cloth that was finally found of a tins

11:16.218 --> 11:35.757
line, a tins line which is real hard, waterproof, 
windproof, and that in the form of a one-piece

11:16.218 --> 11:35.757
coverall again lined with with goose down on the 
inside.

11:41.500 --> 11:48.833
The result of that is you find today a product 
called Gore-Tex, G-R-E-T-E-X, okay? Yeah, by

11:48.853 --> 11:50.395
Gorman. Yeah. No, wait a minute. What's the guy's 
name? His name is Gore, isn't it? Yeah, yeah. So,

11:55.544 --> 11:57.587
it's Gore-Tex. That's the forerunner of this 
uniform I had. Gore-Tex is a waterproof Yeah,

12:02.517 --> 12:04.519
that's right. And hard as hell. You can't cut it 
with a knife. And then I had a same sort of headgear

12:09.264 --> 12:27.283
with wolf fur on the outside, which would not 
permit

12:09.264 --> 12:27.283
snow to melt on my face. I

12:27.523 --> 12:32.288
was able to negotiate

12:34.580 --> 12:36.343
with just a small amount of weight. Well, the 
problem resolved itself around the fact that you

12:37.305 --> 12:48.183
can't get enough goose down to equip a division of 
troops. It just isn't available, and I put the

12:48.203 --> 12:59.743
Natick Laboratories up in Massachusetts 
requirement on them to come up with the material to

12:48.203 --> 12:59.743
replace goose down. It's my understanding that 
they've been able to do that now, but it's been one

13:01.529 --> 13:19.822
hell of an expensive proposition to try to come up 
with a synthetic that produces the same warmth

13:01.529 --> 13:19.822
capability, protection capability as goose 
down. Is that how we got things like hollow film?

13:21.805 --> 13:24.470
Yes, yes, yes. Those are all the requirements. 
originated out of those exercises over the years,

13:26.639 --> 13:33.368
not only that one but others.

13:35.051 --> 13:40.718
Probably the most effective vehicle for moving 
across the snow is a surface effects vehicle.

13:41.299 --> 13:43.402
Surface effects vehicle, as you know. That's a 
vehicle that operates on air cushion. Yeah, on air

13:48.028 --> 13:49.370
cushion. Helicopters, we found, created 
snowstorms. We'd be able to set down a piece of

13:53.856 --> 13:56.460
artillery The normal procedure is to sit down next 
to it and let the 15 men off it and the ammunition

13:56.879 --> 14:06.251
that's going to run that artillery piece. But in 
letting the ammunition bag under the artillery

14:06.271 --> 14:23.173
piece that slung down under the helicopter on the 
ground, it created such a snowstorm that the

14:06.271 --> 14:23.173
helicopter had to fly away and wait until the storm 
subsided before he could come back and create

14:23.660 --> 14:28.745
another storm, but go ahead and sit down and let the 
men out. So we learned a tremendous amount of what

14:28.765 --> 14:34.231
you need to do. One thing we know that we have to do if 
we're going to have that kind of operations in

14:35.352 --> 14:44.241
Alaska in the snow, we know that we have to go 
stabilize the snow. How do you do that? Well, you

14:46.944 --> 14:49.026
spray it with a chemical. and stabilize the snow so 
you can sit down without creating these clouds. Of

14:55.413 --> 15:04.966
course, if you're doing this operation near the 
enemy, you're tipping your hand because he can see

14:55.413 --> 15:04.966
the snow clouds that you're creating.

15:08.751 --> 15:15.840
I would say that 10% at temperatures of minus 50 to 
minus 75 Ten percent of the effort is fighting and

15:17.238 --> 15:21.624
ninety percent is survival. That's just what I 
would think. I would think that the probability of

15:22.826 --> 15:34.623
ever having battle in that type of atmosphere 
would be really slim unless we were talking about—

15:22.826 --> 15:34.623
Particularly ground action. Yeah, exactly. I 
think you'd have to concentrate primarily on air

15:35.725 --> 15:39.911
capability.

15:42.194 --> 15:45.118
Was this aimed toward Siberia? Well, this is aimed 
toward defending ourselves against attacks from

15:45.402 --> 15:52.933
Siberia across the Bering Strait.

15:56.678 --> 16:02.026
Tell me about relations of the Canadians and the 
quality of their troops and officers. Their

16:03.228 --> 16:09.537
troops and officers are very, very high quality. 
As a matter of fact, this particular regiment had

16:11.170 --> 16:15.536
two squadrons. Instead of saying battalions, 
they were talking about squadrons. And one was

16:20.463 --> 16:22.567
French and one was English.

16:25.911 --> 16:33.482
High order of professionalism, very high order of 
professionalism. And this particular regiment

16:33.502 --> 16:40.873
trades off every three years from an English 
regimental commander to a French-speaking

16:33.502 --> 16:40.873
regimental commander. Well, this regiment had a 
lot of capability for insurgency, for scouting,

16:42.929 --> 17:00.748
for operations behind lines, supporting people 
on the flanks, for internal security purposes.

17:01.648 --> 17:06.413
It's a tremendous capability to have in that one 
regiment. But they are not unlike other armies in

17:06.433 --> 17:11.839
the world who have less responsibility in the 
world than the United States. They have so very

17:17.017 --> 17:29.293
few, so little strength, but what they have is 
number one first class in my view, and they've got

17:17.017 --> 17:29.293
some top-notch officers. I have been to school 
with their officers, and I have great admiration

17:30.154 --> 17:35.621
and respect for them. In fact, they just I'd be 
willing to fight under their command or along

17:40.692 --> 17:51.902
beside them or in front of them or behind them or 
wherever you say, anytime, anyplace in the world.

17:51.922 --> 17:53.043
That's how good they are. And they have a brigade in 
Europe at a part of their NATO commitment. And I had

18:01.511 --> 18:07.577
visited that unit in 1976

18:01.511 --> 18:07.577
and they had one of the finance brigade commanders 
there was in Europe. He was just totally

18:12.613 --> 18:16.457
outstanding, along with all of his subordinates. 
So I can't speak with nothing but praise and

18:17.739 --> 18:31.553
admiration for Canadian forces, but they're 
awfully small and they don't have very much.

18:34.577 --> 18:35.758
I suppose it's gets back to money and it also gets 
back to what do they need to take care of themselves

18:37.038 --> 18:54.367
when they got a United States down south that's 
damn sure not going to interfere with what they're

18:37.038 --> 18:54.367
doing. Now you were controversial when you were 
down in South Carolina Do you think that they moved

19:02.148 --> 19:07.395
you all the way up to Alaska to put you on ice, so to 
speak?

19:11.980 --> 19:19.129
Maybe so, but I inherited another situation in 
Alaska which I spent many months cleaning out. Oh,

19:19.149 --> 19:20.010
well what was that? The Mafia, the civilian Mafia 
had penetrated the aviation supply company

19:32.236 --> 19:34.199
Fairbanks. And they were stealing off, with the 
assistance of some of the military personnel,

19:34.780 --> 19:46.459
thousands and thousands of dollars worth of 
supplies. Really? Yeah. How'd you find out about

19:50.024 --> 19:51.046
this? Well, this stuff is showing up all over the 
place, the country. U.S. Army equipment is

20:00.367 --> 20:04.413
showing up in places it shouldn't be showing up. Oh 
yeah, that's right. And so, with the aid of a little

20:06.396 --> 20:27.707
help from Washington,

20:06.396 --> 20:27.707
I called for some

20:06.396 --> 20:27.707
fifteen army auditors, special army auditors, 
And about the same number of agents, trained

20:29.392 --> 20:37.805
agents, I was able to penetrate this business. 
Cleaned it out. Some of the mafia started killing

20:42.412 --> 20:49.382
themselves and disappearing before we got 
indictments in the federal court. I cleaned that

20:51.305 --> 20:52.146
out. And about that time... Federal FBI agents? 
Yes. Oh, yeah. Oh, I worked very closely with them.

21:01.746 --> 21:14.640
And my own CID, Criminal Investigations people 
too, from Washington, I had asked to be

21:01.746 --> 21:14.640
reinforced, unbeknownst to anybody, you know.

21:14.660 --> 21:17.603
High quality, did you think the FBI was high 
quality? Oh, absolutely, number one. Just

21:20.086 --> 21:21.087
absolutely. I've always had the greatest 
admiration for the

21:21.307 --> 21:28.575
FBI. Now you get another assignment, another year 
in Vietnam. I get seven days to get to Vietnam,

21:32.876 --> 21:36.661
General Abrams says. Oh, is that how long? Were you 
trying to get back? No, I was trying to spend

21:41.106 --> 21:50.716
another year in Alaska after I'd cleaned this mess 
up so I could go fishing. Get in a little fishing.

21:53.719 --> 21:55.041
Did you have any time? Oh, hell, I only got one— 
float trip of a couple of days, that's all I had.

22:00.514 --> 22:14.700
Miss Hollingsworth, she enjoyed going down to 
Seward Bay and where we had a camp, Army had a camp,

22:00.514 --> 22:14.700
and catching silver salmon and that sort of stuff. 
And I got a chance to go out one Sunday afternoon to

22:14.720 --> 22:21.192
Iliamna and I got a big rainbow down there. I had 
very little time for that. General Abrams called

22:24.341 --> 22:33.354
you up and said, General, Chief of Staff of the Army 
called me up and said, General Abrams wants you

22:24.341 --> 22:33.354
over there right away in seven days. And I said, 
hell, I've got to get Miss Hollingsworth home.

22:38.722 --> 22:40.064
Well, you better get moving. So, my God, we just got 
things stirred up, and I got Miss H back home, and

22:40.124 --> 22:47.955
then I took off and got over there. And what had 
happened there, we had a couple of disasters

22:49.387 --> 23:00.160
up on the DMZ.

23:02.863 --> 23:05.646
And Abrams wanted me back over there. They were 
receiving a lot of criticism about drugs amongst

23:06.568 --> 23:10.452
the soldiers. He had had a fifth The 5th Brigade, 
separate brigade, 5th Independent Brigade that

23:17.973 --> 23:45.718
was on the DMZ between North and South in a fire base 
and they created themselves a mess hall and they

23:17.973 --> 23:45.718
had all the guys in there eating and in comes a 
rocket and kills a big part of the people. Total

23:47.015 --> 23:57.129
violation of how to secure yourself and to allow 
people to congregate in a place that's vulnerable

23:47.015 --> 23:57.129
to attack. Murdered a bunch of people. Then they 
had Mary Ann, Firebase Mary Ann, which is a part of

24:00.553 --> 24:11.588
the old Mealy Division, the 23rd Division, 
Marical Division, had the Mealy problems. Well,

24:12.513 --> 24:17.660
they guys went to sleep in a fire base. Communists 
overrun them, killed most of them. And Abrams, I

24:23.167 --> 24:26.091
guess, thought that was the problem. We better get 
the meanest son of a bitch in the world back over

24:26.111 --> 24:30.237
here. That's why he called you? Yeah, yeah. 
Meanest son of a bitch in the world back over here to

24:35.644 --> 24:40.270
sort this out. Is that what he told you when he got 
there? Yeah, yeah. He said, I want you to get up

24:43.917 --> 24:47.201
there and get it sorted out. I said, well, I'll take 
a look at it. He said, I don't want you looking at it.

24:51.706 --> 24:56.452
I want you to sort it out.

24:56.472 --> 25:00.817
Well, it had, deterioration had, you know, 
nothing to do. The President of the United States

25:00.877 --> 25:11.410
and the Secretary of Defense and all the high 
moguls in Washington, plus all the Congress, I

25:12.622 --> 25:20.092
went up north and you had 23rd Division up there and 
101st Airborne Division. And this separate

25:21.754 --> 25:27.541
brigade up there, bits and pieces of artillery 
scattered here and there.

25:30.525 --> 25:38.055
And I became the deputy commander as a major 
general, deputy commander of the 24th Corps.

25:39.284 --> 25:40.766
That's the emblem right there. This is what they 
gave me when I lived up there. 24th Corps was

25:43.990 --> 25:47.474
commanded by a hell of a fine guy. A nice guy. What 
was his name? His name was, I'd rather not call his

25:53.221 --> 25:56.505
name. He was just a nice guy. Nice guys don't win 
ballgames. And he turned me loose. He said, I know

26:03.514 --> 26:06.237
why you're here. He was a three star? Yeah, he was a 
three star. You have the freedom of the run. Well, I

26:15.306 --> 26:17.568
started sorting things out. I found a battery of 
artillery that couldn't perform. Remember now we

26:23.474 --> 26:28.499
were deactivating units and they were bringing 
them home and that sort of stuff. I found a battery

26:29.380 --> 26:35.025
of artillery that was so hopped up on drugs that 
rather than try to train it, I just deactivated it

26:35.984 --> 26:39.808
in place. Took all the people away, sent them home, 
and deactivated it right there in the spot. That

26:48.739 --> 26:49.520
bad off. That bad off. They couldn't have fired 
around in any direction anywhere. Marijuana?

26:56.748 --> 26:57.369
Marijuana. So, uh, I got very tough with them. I 
went into the 101st Division. I found rusty

27:04.807 --> 27:24.604
weapons and fire bases and here the division 
commander, I'd have the division commander and

27:04.807 --> 27:24.604
the brigade commander and the battalion 
commander and the whole sequence of command right

27:04.807 --> 27:24.604
there and here I am looking at a rusty rifle in a fire 
base and I said, inexcusable.

27:27.503 --> 27:33.270
How's this guy gonna save his life with this thing 
and he won't shoot? Well that's how lax things have

27:33.290 --> 27:35.433
gotten. Well the only thing that saved us I guess 
was the fact that you had to leave. In the meantime I

27:41.920 --> 27:50.811
knew Giep up there from intelligence reports was 
getting ready to pull off an onslaught As we left,

27:52.090 --> 28:04.925
he was going to come in with all of his conventional 
capability and not a

27:52.090 --> 28:04.925
counterinsurgency role that he had been doing, 
but now he's ready. He's got all the tanks and

28:04.945 --> 28:13.134
equipment, T-54, T-55 tanks, artillery, air 
defense weapons that the Soviets had sent him.

28:14.015 --> 28:17.119
He's all set now to go conventional. against the 
Vietnamization which was the Vietnamese plus a

28:17.622 --> 28:45.756
handful of Americans left and he struck on the 30th 
of March meantime here I am up there sorting things

28:17.622 --> 28:45.756
out and we're sending people home sending people 
home when Abrams relieves a major general who is

28:17.622 --> 28:45.756
more or less a commander of the third Vietnamese 
Corps just outside of Saigon.

28:52.170 --> 29:01.084
Abrams relieves him and by God I get instructions 
to go immediately so I go there immediately on the

28:52.170 --> 29:01.084
15th of December. That relief came as a result of an 
element of artillery on the Cambodian border

29:12.449 --> 29:26.984
having a little conflict with a troop of cavalry, 
U.S. Cavalry, the 1st Cavalry Division, and the

29:12.449 --> 29:26.984
artillery soldiers got up and left their 
artillery pieces because they were scheduled to

29:12.449 --> 29:26.984
go home. The U.S. Army? Yeah, U.S. They got up and 
left them, and here you are in the face of the enemy

29:29.566 --> 29:39.216
on the Cambodian border, the artillery pieces 
sitting there. So the cavalry was sent up to guard

29:39.483 --> 29:46.394
the pieces, and they resented the hell out of that, 
of course. Where did you find these soldiers? I

29:47.816 --> 29:50.700
don't know whatever happened to them. But anyway, 
that had happened and occurred and had been sorted

29:51.882 --> 30:03.119
out, but then I guess General Abrams had decided 
that that fellow needed to go home. He must have

30:03.179 --> 30:04.481
been tired. Actually, generals don't get tired, 
you know. So,

30:09.959 --> 30:14.685
I go down there and take over that. I inherit a 
three-star Third Vietnamese Corps commander

30:15.806 --> 30:36.490
who had been one hell of a guy as a regimental 
commander and as a division commander.

30:39.237 --> 31:00.166
But I thought he was weak as hell as a corps 
commander and he had been fighting the war for

30:39.237 --> 31:00.166
twenty years and wounded seven or eight times and I 
guess what happens to a man you finally reach a

30:39.237 --> 31:00.166
point of no return and no end to what you've been 
doing for twenty years and you just finally reach a

30:39.237 --> 31:00.166
point where you're totally ineffective. As a 
result of that I had to take over command of that

31:01.508 --> 31:08.097
Vietnamese corps because he was so sick and so 
frightened that he couldn't eat and he couldn't

31:08.887 --> 31:12.754
sleep. So instead of me being— He was the 
three-star Vietnamese general. Yeah, instead of

31:16.921 --> 31:20.887
me being his advisor, I became the commander. I did 
it all. And on the 30th of March, they assaulted Loc

31:24.413 --> 31:32.447
Ninh with new forces. And then they moved to 
Arnlock, a province capital, in a big rubber

31:33.423 --> 31:51.349
plantation that was to become GEAP's 
headquarters for control in the South. And they

31:51.970 --> 31:59.100
were to take that by the 18th of April and set up 
their new government down there. I refused to let

32:01.063 --> 32:02.805
them have it. And I had one Vietnamese, part of one 
Vietnamese division in there, plus some province

32:03.983 --> 32:16.618
forces of total strength was 6,800. 6,800 
Vietnamese? How many Americans? About six. About

32:22.485 --> 32:23.326
six? Six Americans, yeah, advisors. And they took 
on 49,000 starting on the 5th of April. And they

32:35.000 --> 32:36.622
were totally surrounded. And you were in there? I 
went in and out. By helicopter? By helicopter. And

32:45.575 --> 32:54.328
that was under siege from the 5th of April until I 
finally killed that formation the second time.

32:57.032 --> 33:04.062
And Mr. Gieb decided that he no longer had an 
offensive capability on the 18th of May. There was

33:05.763 --> 33:12.930
continuous, sporadic action all around, but I had 
totally destroyed his offensive capability. And

33:13.491 --> 33:16.193
at that time, I had destroyed it twice. I destroyed 
it first when he attacked with five divisions.

33:23.000 --> 33:23.741
Tell me about this. Well, they had five divisions 
that attacked 360 degrees around these guys, plus

33:24.782 --> 33:35.112
one artillery division. which they'd brought in, 
and the artillery division beat to pieces all the

33:35.615 --> 33:58.143
Vietnamese artillery inside and destroyed the 
whole place of An Loc, a beautiful French

33:35.615 --> 33:58.143
province, you know, town headquarters, red tile 
roofs and all that sort of stuff. Very French,

33:58.163 --> 34:00.286
modern place. It was a province headquarters with 
20,000 people in it.

34:07.357 --> 34:10.561
They destroyed that, a large share of it. They were 
supposed to have that on the 18th. The 9th VC

34:13.985 --> 34:28.844
Division, those that we captured and killed of 
that division, had a clean uniform in his pack and

34:13.985 --> 34:28.844
they were going to be the parade forces on the 18th 
of April when they set up their new government and

34:13.985 --> 34:28.844
took over the South. Well, with the use of B-52s and 
TAC air, and some helicopter gunship. And by the

34:39.907 --> 34:46.774
use of C-130s, I was able to keep ammunition 
supplies going in there. And at the end of the first

34:46.794 --> 35:05.494
battle, which was over about the 16th or 17th,

34:46.794 --> 35:05.494
they were unable to attack me again until the 10th 
of May, at which time they brought down 40,000 more

35:05.947 --> 35:13.675
replacements plus 135 tanks, T-55 tanks.

35:13.935 --> 35:19.681
At that time I counted my strength and I was down to 
about 3,000.

35:22.144 --> 35:35.498
That included wounded because the Vietnamese 
refused to go in and take all these helicopters

35:22.144 --> 35:35.498
we'd give them and train them with for the last 
eight years, refused to go in and evacuate their

35:22.144 --> 35:35.498
own wounded. Really? The South Vietnamese? The 
South Vietnamese refused to go in and back their

35:38.689 --> 35:42.173
own wounded. Why was that? Because they'd get the 
hell shot out of them. And the other thing is they

35:46.698 --> 35:59.612
lost total control of their people and when they'd 
get a helicopter in there you had only about two

35:46.698 --> 35:59.612
seconds to sit down, load up, and get out before the 
incoming rockets and artillery. The high day of

36:00.267 --> 36:21.655
rocket incoming fire on those forces was 5,800 
rounds in a 24-hour period, which we think, for the

36:00.267 --> 36:21.655
density that we held on the 10th of May, we only had 
100,000

36:00.267 --> 36:21.655
meters by 2,000 meters. That's all we had. That was 
all that was left at Onlon. We had that. with

36:26.862 --> 36:37.854
probably 2,800 people, some of them afraid to 
shoot their weapons because they knew that if they

36:26.862 --> 36:37.854
were wounded, there was no medical capability. 
And they knew that their own people wouldn't

36:37.874 --> 36:40.717
evacuate them. And I was told that I could not 
afford to have any casualties because

36:42.359 --> 36:51.469
Vietnamization is working. And I knew goddamn 
well how well Vietnamization was working because

36:52.748 --> 37:21.203
here I am in command of all 14 provinces plus all the 
regional forces and the popular forces in all the

36:52.748 --> 37:21.203
villages plus the five-division Vietnamese 
capability against now in the total and final

36:52.748 --> 37:21.203
analysis about 67 divisions of North Vietnamese 
around An Long. And I'm catching hell from

37:22.803 --> 37:25.166
everybody. And bad press. And... Why bad press? 
Well, press, for example, one time... During this

37:32.596 --> 37:37.864
battle? Yeah, during the whole damn campaign, 
during April and May. Well, one time I landed on the

37:41.929 --> 37:49.840
road, Highway 13, which had been cut off and 
blocked, which is our supply route in there, which

37:41.929 --> 37:49.840
caused no ground element supply at all. It had to 
all be by air, air droppable.

37:59.369 --> 38:09.027
I was, I was standing out there and the BBC, I looked 
around and somebody had a microphone stuck

37:59.369 --> 38:09.027
between the legs. Well, General, what are you 
going to do today? Have you lost on lock? I said,

38:14.501 --> 38:17.084
hell no, I haven't lost on lock. And he said, well, 
what are you going to do today? I said, I'm going to

38:19.087 --> 38:23.773
kill every one of these bastards before they get 
back into Cambodia.

38:26.896 --> 38:39.992
And Jesus God, first thing I know, the Secretary of 
Defense, old Hubert Humphrey, who was a leftist

38:26.896 --> 38:39.992
son of a bitch, and a goddamn Catholic Priest in 
Washington saying, you ought to relieve that guy.

38:43.737 --> 38:45.820
He's trying to kill his enemy.

38:49.064 --> 38:49.805
Can you imagine that? Well, Abrams come out and he 
said, God damn it, you have to talk to the press. I

38:56.272 --> 38:58.936
said, no, I don't have to talk to the press. I avoid 
the goddamn press. But when some son of a bitch

39:01.939 --> 39:09.068
sticks a microphone up between my legs, next time 
I'm going to shoot him. He said, Jesus Christ, I'd

39:10.246 --> 39:13.950
rather you talk to him than shoot him.

39:19.475 --> 39:21.357
One or another is bad enough. Well, you know, you 
know, goddamned

39:23.439 --> 39:31.748
anti-American bastards in America or something 
else. Anyway...

39:38.056 --> 39:40.499
We went ahead and won that damn battle. What about 
the second siege? Oh, second siege, the second go

39:42.161 --> 39:44.644
at it. You were telling me about the buildup. Well, 
they got them all back together, and we started

39:46.867 --> 39:52.694
getting pressure on the 10th. So I went out to see 
General Abrams.

39:59.643 --> 40:01.044
He said, can you hold it? I said, well, if I get 
enough firepower, I can. I said, I don't have any

40:03.668 --> 40:06.211
troops hardly left the town. I said, I got it. 
Somehow or another, I got to get them to hold. If I

40:09.942 --> 40:13.548
can just get them to hold, I'll kill the rest of the 
bastards myself. But I've got to get them to hold.

40:19.376 --> 40:24.784
He said, well, I got 125 sorties a day of B-52s. He 
said, I've been thinking about giving all of them

40:25.004 --> 40:36.261
to you one day and then give them the next area over 
in fuel up in the second core area of Viet Cong up in

40:36.899 --> 41:03.767
the hill country some help the next day and then up 
on the DMZ in the first core area in Da Nang area the

40:36.899 --> 41:03.767
next day and I said well god damn it if you do that it 
means three and I'll get them all tomorrow and then

40:36.899 --> 41:03.767
when I need them the next day they're out their 
B-52s are gone somewhere else I said I'm not so sure

40:36.899 --> 41:03.767
that I can stand that But I said, by God, I'll accept 
that if you'll give them to me when I want them. He

41:12.492 --> 41:14.835
said, well, when do you think you're going to be 
attacked? I said, I think I'm going to be attacked

41:14.895 --> 41:19.661
at 5.30 on the morning of the 11th. He said, why do 
you say that? I said, because of the buildup and the

41:21.303 --> 41:31.515
pressures I'm getting all around the perimeter, 
tank movements and that sort of stuff. And I said,

41:31.535 --> 41:34.058
if you could give them all to me then, over a 30-hour 
period,

41:36.080 --> 41:44.192
plus a Kitty Hawk and a Hancock, plus the 7th Air 
Force.

41:47.177 --> 41:53.526
Meantime, the president has sent Alexander Haig 
and Henry Kissinger over. Alexander Haig comes

41:54.107 --> 42:00.697
under president and wants to know from you 
personally, can you hold it? That's what Haig

42:02.920 --> 42:04.062
asked you? Yeah, he said, the president wanted me 
to ask you personally, and I have to pass the

42:04.092 --> 42:08.657
president. I said, I don't know. You'd like a beer? 
Yeah. Beer. Thank you. So,

42:19.729 --> 42:24.374
I said, I don't know, Al. I said, God damn it, if I can 
get some damn firepower here to support it, I said,

42:24.394 --> 42:29.560
I think I can.

42:33.117 --> 42:36.701
He said, well, the president's going to give you a 
third star if you can do it. Really? That's what

42:37.822 --> 42:40.125
Hank said to you right there on the spot? That's 
what Hank said to me. I said, I'm not interested in

42:41.306 --> 42:44.309
any goddamn third star. I said,

42:44.429 --> 42:51.477
I'll see what the hell I can do here. I've got to have 
the damn firepower.

42:55.902 --> 43:00.627
I had four battalions of infantry left in the 3rd 
Brigade of the 1st Cavalry Division. and a handful

43:01.687 --> 43:05.534
of helicopters. And I wasn't permitted to use 
these infantrymen. So Abrams comes out— They were

43:09.802 --> 43:11.645
Americans. Americans, yeah. Everybody else had 
gone home, except a hell of a big lot of

43:13.047 --> 43:22.284
headquarters, about 30,000 civilians and 
military left in headquarters there. And that's

43:22.304 --> 43:25.770
the reason why they didn't want the damn high 
command captured.

43:29.530 --> 43:35.139
Remember, they had gotten into Saigon with a hell 
of a lot less strength in 1968. But I had no goddamn

43:37.403 --> 43:39.646
strength at all. I wasn't going to allow the son of a 
bitch that's in there. So, well, Abrams comes out

43:42.471 --> 43:48.901
to see me, and he said... He flew out? Yeah, in his 
helicopter, he came out to see me from his

43:50.163 --> 43:54.390
headquarters down in Saigon. He said, Secretary 
of Defense and the President wants to continue

43:55.788 --> 44:07.942
withdrawal

43:55.788 --> 44:07.942
of forces, drawdown.

44:10.425 --> 44:14.630
He said, and you want more air power? I said, yeah. 
He said, what will you trade for a Marine Air Group?

44:24.425 --> 44:33.099
I said, I'll trade you two battalions of infantry, 
but those guys are out there protecting the rocket

44:24.425 --> 44:33.099
belt to keep rockets from falling on your head down 
there. And I said, I don't think you're going to get

44:33.119 --> 44:36.164
any. I think all those rocket forces are all up 
around me at Unlock. You haven't had any rounds in

44:41.733 --> 44:43.776
on you recently. I said, I'll trade you two 
battalions of infantry for a Marine air wing. He

44:50.260 --> 44:53.765
said, well, hell, there's only 900 people in that 
Marine air wing. I said, yeah, I don't give a damn

44:53.845 --> 44:55.948
how many people we got. I just want the damn 
airplanes. 36 airplanes, or 24, 20. Yeah, about 36

45:00.654 --> 45:04.219
airplanes. A-4s, A-4s. So, that was the 12th 
Marine Air Group. So, commanded by Colonel Dan

45:12.470 --> 45:17.196
Mocko, who should have been a Marine Brigadier, 
but never was, and retired as a colonel. God damn,

45:22.186 --> 45:24.353
what a phenomenal guy. Anyway,

45:25.617 --> 45:30.915
he said, well, by God, I want you.
