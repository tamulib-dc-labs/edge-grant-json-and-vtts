00:01.381 --> 00:10.254
In 1952, I have listed here a ball breaker 
signaling device.

00:10.274 --> 00:12.277
Well, that was kind of fun. And I must say, as usual, 
these things have a little more implication than

00:12.297 --> 00:18.646
they sound like. That was Art Maxwell and me, I 
think. At any rate, at that time, there was a lot of

00:21.811 --> 00:30.443
importance of measuring, taking cores on the 
ocean bottom and taking temperature gradient in

00:31.958 --> 00:38.367
the ocean bottom, which required very precise 
lowering of devices at great depths in the ocean.

00:39.388 --> 00:40.249
Temperature probes. And it was important to know 
when you were on bottom. And these were depths of

00:43.714 --> 00:48.961
4,000 fathom or so, you see. 3,000 fathom. Well, 
you've got a lot of cable out. There's a fairly

00:52.045 --> 00:55.009
light instrument on the bottom of it. There's 
really no way to tell when you're on the bottom of

00:55.029 --> 00:57.472
it. And so... You needed something that told you 
when you hit bottom.

01:06.081 --> 01:09.967
Well, there was quite a lot of possibilities of how 
you did this. And there have certainly been much

01:10.047 --> 01:13.472
more sophisticated devices since. But this, we 
rigged up one real fast. And it was a glass ball with

01:15.895 --> 01:22.145
a hammer and a trip. And when it hit bottom, the 
hammer came down and presumably smashed the glass

01:22.425 --> 01:26.812
ball. And the ocean, finding itself unsupported, 
since there's now a hole in the middle of it at 2,000

01:29.907 --> 01:32.531
or 3,000. Fathom rushes in, and the noise it makes 
when it meets itself coming from all sides is

01:32.611 --> 01:39.142
considerable. There's a lot of power in that. And 
you hear this bang on the surface, so you know

01:41.466 --> 01:45.012
you've hit bottom. Well, it turned out to be much 
more difficult to break these damn glass balls. I

01:48.397 --> 01:49.539
suspected it. Then you'd have a hammer that'd just 
smash into pieces on the surface. But under this

01:53.405 --> 01:54.988
pressure, it didn't do anything. It just bounced. 
You make a point on the hammer, big hammer, you

01:57.211 --> 02:00.876
know, dropping. You make a point on the hammer, the 
hammer would sometimes go into the ball and seal.

02:04.422 --> 02:09.349
Other times it would go in and knock a shell off and 
the ball would be intact when you came up.

02:12.013 --> 02:14.436
Sometimes the ball would crack all the pieces but 
not break. It would all be held together by the

02:14.497 --> 02:16.299
pressure. Well, we finally made the proper kind of 
point that it always broke the ball. But this, of

02:22.228 --> 02:23.590
course, had led... That paper, incidentally, 
then, and our remarks about the difficulty of

02:24.025 --> 02:43.173
breaking the ball have led to the utilization of 
glass capsules in underwater vehicles and

02:24.025 --> 02:43.173
spherical capsules in underwater instruments of 
all sorts, because glass obviously requires

02:24.025 --> 02:43.173
quite different properties under these very high 
pressures. Excuse me. I have high-speed

02:49.502 --> 02:51.906
plankton. sampler in 1958. Yeah, that was a kind of 
fun device. When we were first starting out, 1958?

03:00.153 --> 03:03.077
Oh, we designed that much earlier than that. That 
was when the paper came out, I guess. It came out

03:04.840 --> 03:06.061
years later. That was back in 1951 or so, or 53 
maybe. It was a torpedo-shaped plankton sampler

03:13.587 --> 03:19.175
that could be towed at high speed at considerable 
depth. And it had a neat little recorder in it that

03:19.435 --> 03:25.284
told you how deep it was and how much water was 
passing through it at each depth. It worked very

03:25.925 --> 03:26.686
well.

03:29.710 --> 03:31.012
It was used for quite a few years. I have, in 1966, an 
Isaacs-Brown opening-closing trawl. That's

03:36.279 --> 03:43.189
just a modification of the midwater trawl that 
allows you to open and close it at some depth. Now,

03:43.507 --> 03:47.751
the last two things I would like some elaboration 
on. 1968, a deep sea observational camera system.

03:55.118 --> 03:57.740
Well, over a series of years we developed these 
cameras. They were free fall cameras that you

03:57.760 --> 04:04.046
could chuck over the ship's side. And they went to 
increasing sophistication. We designed them in

04:08.370 --> 04:10.171
several different forms. They went to the bottom. 
They usually had a bait in the foreground

04:13.763 --> 04:17.867
somewhere, a mass of fish or something. And they 
sat down there taking pictures every five minutes

04:18.528 --> 04:31.362
or 10 minutes, sometimes still pictures, 
sometimes movies, motion pictures, and

04:18.528 --> 04:31.362
sometimes stereo motion pictures. We had some 
interesting stereo motion pictures. And we

04:34.545 --> 04:43.635
discovered a great deal about the deep benthic 
fauna and how it behaved. what the distribution of

04:45.353 --> 04:55.365
these creatures were, how they probably searched 
for their food, and a whole different food web, you

04:45.353 --> 04:55.365
see, of very active deep creatures, yes.

04:58.569 --> 05:10.264
I think I'll try to revise that program because 
it's kind of a natural for a cooperation with small

04:58.569 --> 05:10.264
coastal countries because the cameras can be 
operated from unspecialized vehicles. They can

05:10.700 --> 05:19.213
be dropped over the side and sections taken down 
across the shelf and find out what really lives in

05:10.700 --> 05:19.213
these deeps. We find, for instance, along this 
coast that some of the commercial fish of British

05:19.393 --> 05:32.292
Columbia and southern Alaska and Washington, 
probably their main population is down here off

05:19.393 --> 05:32.292
Baja California at great depths. They're 
creatures of the cold, dark waters, and they

05:33.594 --> 05:40.504
merely outcrop up in the Arctic regions or near 
Arctic regions. And that's where the principal

05:41.648 --> 05:43.890
commercial fishery is based. But the population 
itself extends to increasing depths down farther

05:44.371 --> 05:51.638
and farther and closer to the equator. We find a big 
population of great arctic sharks off the Baja

05:52.099 --> 05:57.184
California coast, for example. A shark very much 
like the

05:59.126 --> 06:07.975
Icelandic or Greenland shark. Huge one. lots of 
shrimp, we'd find deep lobsters, we'd find all

06:12.142 --> 06:19.011
sorts of things. When did you first become 
interested in photography?

06:24.118 --> 06:25.399
You mean in underwater photography? In 
underwater photography and above water

06:25.419 --> 06:27.382
photography. Well, I became much impressed by the 
competency of first-rate cameras to record

06:27.402 --> 06:38.256
things at Bikini, I think. Well, before that, I was 
in charge of the photography of the two A-bomb

06:40.019 --> 06:46.167
shots in 1946. And the fact that these big aerial 
cameras would allow you to place in space and in

06:48.129 --> 07:07.714
position ships and explosive phenomena and so on 
and so forth, I thought was, when they were rigidly

06:48.129 --> 07:07.714
based on land, was a very powerful technique.

07:09.770 --> 07:15.657
I've used these kinds of cameras in determining 
the motion of an amphibious craft in the surf zone.

07:16.838 --> 07:28.531
In that early work at Berkeley, you see, by 
mounting cameras on shore and aiming them aerial

07:16.838 --> 07:28.531
cameras, big mapping aerial cameras on shore 
aimed at amphibious craft coming through the

07:16.838 --> 07:28.531
surf. You then could position a craft exactly in 
space continuously, see just what its motions

07:29.352 --> 07:34.979
were. On a big craft, you could even measure the 
bending of the hull. Well, I was much impressed by

07:39.183 --> 07:46.573
the competency of first-class mapping cameras 
used in those kind of modes. And, of course, I've

07:48.156 --> 07:54.645
always wanted to see what did the ocean do with a 
dead whale on its bottom? What in the devil does it

07:55.426 --> 07:56.587
do with it? It increases the food supply in square 
miles for years, a dead whale. It must be adapted to

08:03.077 --> 08:04.519
utilize it. And so it turns out it is.

08:14.637 --> 08:22.509
Because

08:14.637 --> 08:22.509
I'd been doing this radio-controlled 
photography. We not only had two aerial cameras

08:23.270 --> 08:36.531
shooting at amphibious craft in the surf, but a 
radio-controlled camera and a planar blimp up

08:23.270 --> 08:36.531
above photographing simultaneously with radio 
control. She triggered the shots in an automatic

08:37.973 --> 08:40.898
system. And then Revell asked you then to go to 
Bikini and mount cameras, which would do

08:42.228 --> 08:47.515
something? Be in charge of the photography. Be in 
charge of photography, right. OK. Oh, the

08:50.299 --> 08:53.243
land-based photography. Well, the 
radio-controlled photography. And did you use

08:55.906 --> 08:59.050
the same techniques there that you had used? 
Essentially, yeah. Did you make any substantial

09:01.253 --> 09:03.236
changes? Oh, well, of course, they had lots more 
backups and things, because there was no going

09:03.737 --> 09:11.627
back and repairing the cameras. And so we built the 
towers, and we designed the backups. And the

09:19.907 --> 09:27.856
backups were, of course, it was uncertain at that 
time what would happen to radio signals at the time

09:19.907 --> 09:27.856
of an atomic explosion. So we had not only a central 
radio triggering

09:28.777 --> 09:41.412
synchronizers for the total cameras, airborne 
and land, But we had backup individual timers on

09:42.404 --> 09:45.712
each camera. So if it failed to get its pulses, it 
asked for another one. If it got another one and

09:48.238 --> 09:52.507
didn't respond, then it took its own picture 
anyway. And as a matter of fact, that saved our neck

09:53.169 --> 09:56.837
just at the instant of the explosion. That's what 
Revell said, exactly what happened. He did? Yeah.

10:02.459 --> 10:03.300
When was that? When I interviewed him. He 
suggested that the camera work here was not only

10:04.161 --> 10:11.891
splendid, but it involved innovation, which had 
not been done before in camera. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:13.934 --> 10:14.294
That's right. And so exactly what happened? Why 
did the cameras fail the first time? Oh, just

10:19.862 --> 10:24.508
because of the tremendous electrostatic charge 
that is built up at that instance. You see a vast

10:24.548 --> 10:29.454
amount of static just for that instant shot. So we 
got pictures.

10:33.063 --> 10:39.052
The bomb had gone off under water, the bottom of the 
fleet was lit up, and the Shockwave had not yet

10:33.063 --> 10:39.052
arrived at the surface. In thirty fathom of water. 
The bottom of the fleet was lit. And there's not a

10:45.641 --> 10:48.225
pimple on the surface yet. That's pretty 
remarkable photography.

10:54.253 --> 10:57.918
Now, was it contact here on Bikini Atoll? Is this 
the contact that brings you to Scripps

10:58.279 --> 11:00.522
Institution? This contact with Revelle here? No, 
I don't know. The first time I ever remember

11:03.497 --> 11:08.162
Revelle was an interesting case, as a matter of 
fact. I'd built the first of these sea sleds. And we

11:11.286 --> 11:14.449
were at Morro Bay, California. And I had built it, 
and then I was out on the beach, and we were going to

11:15.950 --> 11:20.435
test it for the first time. We had a duck, and we had a 
big spool of rope, just rope, manila rope. And I had

11:28.447 --> 11:32.051
attached this, and I had two helpers, two duck 
drivers. I had attached this roll, and we had it on a

11:32.792 --> 11:34.995
standard. And I said, well, we just started in the 
surf. First time we ever started a sea sled. And the

11:44.406 --> 11:58.183
commandant of the little naval base there came 
down and says, there's an important young

11:44.406 --> 11:58.183
lieutenant at the train in San Luis Obispo. You're 
supposed to go pick up. I'd never heard of a bell

12:00.677 --> 12:02.580
before. So I got in the car and went down and picked 
up this young, slender, tall lieutenant and

12:04.643 --> 12:14.578
brought him back. And we came down on the beach. And 
here are these two guys. I told him about this sea

12:18.484 --> 12:21.228
sled for taking a line through the sea. Here are 
these two guys, 6,000 feet of line, standing out in

12:21.649 --> 12:27.057
the ocean. cable spool is pulled off the standards 
they've got an oar shoved through the through the

12:28.100 --> 12:52.926
cable spool and it's plowing the sand down towards 
the beach so obviously they're being pulled into

12:28.100 --> 12:52.926
the surf both of them i grabbed the duck then and ran 
a wire out from the winch at the stern of it and got

12:28.100 --> 12:52.926
hold of it they hadn't had time to do this thing was 
obvious so it was an interesting First

12:53.530 --> 13:00.077
introduction to Ravel and our work there, he was 
immensely impressed by that damn sea sled, I must

12:53.530 --> 13:00.077
say. You know, this kind of mysteriously line 
going out into the ocean, these two guys, and of

13:00.998 --> 13:06.264
course I'm obviously shocked and excited. So that 
was my first introduction to him. We then took him

13:07.806 --> 13:10.869
out in the surf in the duck. He'd never been out in a 
BUKW, you know, a wheeled vehicle. Marvelous

13:15.294 --> 13:16.636
vehicles. Marvelous. We never really managed to 
sink one in any reasonable sort of... I have a

13:23.467 --> 13:28.292
picture of one with a 28-foot breaker coming up on 
it. I was in. I survived it, obviously. Well,

13:32.756 --> 13:37.340
anyway, so that was my first introduction to 
Ravel. Maybe 1945, I don't know when it was. He was

13:40.844 --> 13:43.646
just organizing the O&R. Marvelous man. And, 
well, who specifically taps you to do the

13:47.190 --> 13:50.793
photography at Bikini? He does. Ravel. He does. 
All right. And then after photography, there,

13:53.015 --> 13:56.059
and... I got interested in radioactivity. Okay. 
And waves. In fact, that's one of the reasons we did

14:00.966 --> 14:03.089
the photography. It turned out it really was 
necessary to place all the ships in the exact

14:03.409 --> 14:08.717
position. But then, of course, the main purpose 
was the wave theory, what kind of explosive waves

14:10.219 --> 14:19.091
were produced by these sorts of things. And that's 
what we followed them on the bigger shots later.

14:23.710 --> 14:25.252
the waves. What sort of wave did you expect? From 
that? Oh, just about what came, what we produced,

14:30.019 --> 14:33.965
yeah. Some people argue that the wave would be, you 
know, untold feet high and would... Well, that

14:33.985 --> 14:49.989
was, those were interesting days when we first 
shot off the Beglands out there because it wasn't a

14:33.985 --> 14:49.989
bit clear that the atoll would necessarily not 
collapse. And we had some of the best world-famous

14:51.942 --> 14:57.107
Kistiakowsky, the famous soil machination. You 
see, a coral atoll is really kind of a barrel full of

14:58.728 --> 15:04.814
mud, a thin shell, a brittle shell. And it's clear 
that coral atolls only exist where there are no

15:05.214 --> 15:11.119
earthquakes.

15:11.960 --> 15:14.002
So there was a real question. Was the thing stable 
or not? The bomb itself probably couldn't make a

15:16.724 --> 15:21.949
highly destructive wave.

15:22.958 --> 15:27.904
over the atoll, it might in critical depth and deep 
water. But as part of the atoll collapsed, then the

15:29.466 --> 15:35.873
amount of energy that got linked into a wave was 
gigantic, you see. And we surely didn't know

15:35.893 --> 15:38.836
whether that would take place or not. And there 
lies a tale of where we almost evacuated the

15:38.857 --> 15:46.646
Pacific Basin by accident. Someday we'll go into 
that one. Was that the cloud mist that appeared?

15:49.889 --> 15:50.350
No, no. No, no.

15:56.303 --> 15:58.345
I don't know if this tale has ever quite been told. 
This was at Ivy Mike, the first big gauge bomb. And

16:03.011 --> 16:10.080
it was shot off on an island in the north of Bikini, 
northwest of Bikini. Totally obliterated the

16:10.881 --> 16:12.142
island. And at that time, we didn't know whether it 
would produce a huge wave or not. So we set off on a

16:16.367 --> 16:20.532
seamount about 700 feet deep. We mounted two 
floating wave gauges. And we had the Horizon, one

16:26.273 --> 16:38.334
of our ships, and Walter Monk was there, and Bill 
Bascom was there, and a fellow by the name of

16:26.273 --> 16:38.334
Commander Monk Hendricks.

16:41.138 --> 16:47.910
And we had these two, and we were going to stay with 
them 12 minutes, which was after the bomb went off.

16:49.595 --> 16:52.518
and see if there was going to be a great change in 
water level. And we had a set of signals. And

16:53.999 --> 17:00.145
everything was set up to start the evacuation of 
Pacific Coast cities if we had a big one. Well, the

17:00.165 --> 17:02.908
bomb went off. We stayed there the 12 minutes. The 
cloud was overhead at this time. We practiced

17:07.633 --> 17:11.156
getting these skiffs back ashore, aboard. Not our 
moorings, just the skiffs we ran. So we watched

17:13.659 --> 17:17.863
that first H-bomb from skiffs 26 miles away. And 
the open water with the horizon was well away.

17:23.848 --> 17:29.835
Well, we had practiced getting those skiffs back 
aboard and us aboard. And the earliest we could do

17:29.915 --> 17:32.999
it was something like 15 minutes. But with that 
cloud overhead, we got it done in something like

17:33.039 --> 17:37.965
five. Every hand was there pulling. Well, we then 
got in the fallout. We took more fallout than any

17:44.853 --> 17:48.998
fixed point on the Earth's surface has ever 
gotten. because we were conned into following a

17:49.720 --> 18:00.295
path that eventually turned out we were following 
the point of maximum fallout for something like 17

17:49.720 --> 18:00.295
hours. Anyway, days later, we got back to the 
skiffs and picked them up. One minute after we left

18:07.985 --> 18:16.317
that skiff, one of these moorings showed a record 
of a 50-foot wave. Something had gone wrong with

18:17.499 --> 18:18.580
it. What had happened was the

18:19.100 --> 18:32.839
pressure gauge had not locked into its position 
and had suddenly let loose and slid down the cable

18:19.100 --> 18:32.839
50 feet. But of course, we wouldn't have known 
that. It went up 50 feet and stayed there. But if

18:38.995 --> 18:48.328
we'd been there and seen the 50-foot, we would have 
certainly called for the evacuation of the

18:38.995 --> 18:48.328
Pacific cities of the North Pacific. And the 
fiasco would have been absolutely gigantic.

18:51.712 --> 18:54.256
Scripps' name would have been totally mud. When 
did you come to Scripps? Well, I oscillated

18:57.620 --> 19:04.750
between Scripps and Berkeley for a year or more in 
about 1948 or thereabouts. I first applied to

19:06.535 --> 19:10.880
Scripps in 1936 for a job. I had been commercial 
fishing. I had gotten a lot of questions about my

19:17.407 --> 19:23.013
mind about the oceans. I asked very puzzling 
things, still puzzling. I had written a letter to

19:31.783 --> 19:35.867
Scripps asking why these things were taking 
place. I got an answer which really didn't address

19:36.893 --> 19:41.738
the questions I'd asked. Just like, you know, even 
today, why you get all kinds of questions from

19:42.218 --> 19:48.744
fishermen and one thing or another. So I thought, 
boy, those guys need some help, you know, down

19:48.764 --> 19:52.248
there. And it seems to me, I can't answer these 
kinds of questions, so I applied for a job. It took

19:58.333 --> 20:05.500
me ten years to get here.

20:05.800 --> 20:11.809
Director then, just freshly director, 1936.

20:11.829 --> 20:16.676
Did it seem to you as if Scripps' institution 
functioned better when it was smaller? Well, it

20:18.298 --> 20:19.640
depends what you mean by better. It was a hell of a 
lot more fun, I guess. In many ways, there was more

20:22.104 --> 20:27.992
rapport, and there was more of a spirit of 
adventure, I think. I was thinking about

20:28.012 --> 20:30.095
interchange of ideas. I'm shocked that a guy comes 
to you and says, how about a troll? You're involved

20:34.341 --> 20:35.503
with a monk. Yeah. And did you seem to have more 
exchange with your colleagues? Was it

20:39.967 --> 20:41.569
compartmentalized then? Is it 
compartmentalized now? Well,

20:43.432 --> 20:53.966
I think an oceanographic institution 
fundamentally has to be interdisciplinary. And I

20:55.007 --> 21:01.356
think it perpetually tends to crystallize into 
special forms of each of the disciplines again,

20:55.007 --> 21:01.356
you see. There's a perpetual necessary to be 
breaking up. There's a polymerization that goes

21:05.672 --> 21:11.218
on, a crystallization that has to be continuously 
combated. People like to talk to people who are in

21:11.678 --> 21:13.980
their same field. There's no question about it. 
Yet really the penetration and understanding of

21:16.243 --> 21:25.572
the universe in general, and the oceans in 
particular, and the planet in particular,

21:16.243 --> 21:25.572
certainly requires a communication of all sorts. 
And yet I think the ideal has to be accumulation

21:32.673 --> 21:44.329
around temporary nuclei that then break up and 
form new associations, and that's a hard thing to

21:32.673 --> 21:44.329
form. Give me a follow-up on this. Now, when Ravel 
goes to Pakistan, don't you go with him? No, I have

21:51.018 --> 21:52.240
been with him. You have been with him to Pakistan. 
Well, that's what I mean. On his first trip to

21:55.324 --> 21:58.168
Pakistan to study the soil, weren't you part of 
that? Sure, yeah. Okay. How would you be involved

22:01.172 --> 22:02.494
in that? What was your connection with this 
solization process? Well, obviously, the salt

22:08.189 --> 22:13.715
eventually had its origins in the oceans. I mean, 
as Ravel says, if you can understand a planet with

22:13.735 --> 22:19.321
oceans, you also have to understand a planet 
without them. That's why you should study Mars.

22:23.826 --> 22:25.347
Kind of control, huh? One planet with, one planet 
without. From that viewpoint, it's not much of a

22:28.175 --> 22:41.133
stretch to say you ought to also look at the doabs of 
West Pakistan, where the problem is salt. And I had

22:42.395 --> 22:46.200
worked some on the salt of the Colorado River and 
various other things. I was interested in

22:46.220 --> 22:47.963
halophytic plants. I think they're really a vast 
potential halophytic plants of this world, the

22:52.306 --> 22:59.855
ones that are perfectly capable, the higher 
plants that are perfectly capable of living in

22:52.306 --> 22:59.855
seawater. Totally unexplored. Almost totally 
unexplored. We have no idea what the total

23:03.440 --> 23:08.166
genetics of all the halophytic plants of this 
world are. Every time we even look at it, we find new

23:08.927 --> 23:11.089
ones. Halophytic avocado, for instance. 
Fortunellas, legumes.

23:19.239 --> 23:19.680
You see. Our crop plants, the crop plants on which 
man depends for his entire existence, strangely

23:20.909 --> 23:32.461
were all developed by prehistoric man. We have 
never developed a crop plant with any

23:33.442 --> 23:36.726
consequence. In historic times, we've made 
improvements, or sort of improvement. But all the

23:44.013 --> 23:50.460
principal tremendous selections of polyploidy 
and everything are made by primitive man. The only

23:52.567 --> 23:55.773
thing we've developed in historic times are 
grapefruit and poshelsprouts. And nobody's

23:56.935 --> 23:58.859
going to feed the human race on those. So the whole 
curious matter of increasing salination around

24:00.322 --> 24:11.824
the world, of the increased need for utilization 
of seawater for agriculture, of aquaculture and

24:12.935 --> 24:15.258
so forth. And this vast array of plants, higher 
plants, that know perfectly well how to

24:15.738 --> 24:29.255
desalinate seawater all by themselves using 
sunlight at high level energy rather than the

24:15.738 --> 24:29.255
degraded form we can use it in, has really received 
no attention. It's something Texas A&M ought to

24:30.436 --> 24:32.359
get into.

24:37.305 --> 24:42.351
Was this what originally attracted you to your 
work on the Colorado River, or was it vice versa?

24:43.158 --> 24:47.382
Well, I got interested in the Colorado River for a 
very curious reason. I was plotting the total

24:48.183 --> 25:01.695
dissolved solids of the Colorado River one time, 
and several other rivers, including the Indus, as

24:48.183 --> 25:01.695
a function of stream flow, annual stream flow. And 
it turns out that instead of that line of plot of

25:01.715 --> 25:11.865
total dissolved solids per year and total water 
flow per year, extrapolating through the 0-0

25:12.773 --> 25:24.403
axis, which is, say, zero dissolved solids 
transported at zero flow, it goes through the

25:12.773 --> 25:24.403
dissolved solid axis at rather high level. It's an 
inclined line, which says, in the case of the

25:24.723 --> 25:32.971
Colorado, that at zero flow, it's transporting 
3,600,000 tons of salt. Well, the only possible

25:33.951 --> 25:40.117
explanation for such a decent river, like the 
Mississippi, goes through the 0-0 axis. But both

25:40.958 --> 25:42.679
the Indus and the Colorado do not. The only 
possible explanation for this is that there are

25:44.245 --> 25:56.059
brine springs feeding into the rivers, brine 
springs, not salt springs, but concentrated

25:44.245 --> 25:56.059
brines, which are continuously flowing. So that 
as the river goes down, a year of low flow, the slant

25:57.541 --> 26:04.870
is higher.

26:06.250 --> 26:14.638
We start hunting for those springs, which we 
assume must exist, and we found none of them in the

26:06.250 --> 26:14.638
hydrological literature at all. We found them in 
anthropological literature. The Indians knew

26:18.221 --> 26:32.054
about these brine springs flowing into Colorado, 
and the first one we looked for was a great series of

26:18.221 --> 26:32.054
volcano-like structures of pure salt with pure 
saturated brine flowing down into Colorado.

26:32.074 --> 26:34.536
600,000 tons a year. and i thought you know the 
hydrological mythology is the river supplies you

26:36.406 --> 27:01.384
with water that god has determined the quality 
that is now your problem nobody ever inquires as to

26:36.406 --> 27:01.384
how it got that quality huh so now here's six just 
this one spring six hundred thousand tons is

26:36.406 --> 27:01.384
enough to put fifteen thousand acres out of 
existence every year by salination but it's a

26:36.406 --> 27:01.384
small flow why not build a little brick retainer 
and pump the damn stuff back up on the mesa or inject

27:02.427 --> 27:10.178
it into the ground and keep it out of the Colorado. 
Can't get anybody interested in that.

27:12.461 --> 27:14.604
Reclamation Department doesn't do that sort of 
thing. Agriculture Department care less. That's

27:16.727 --> 27:18.429
not part of their problem. And so it still flows 
into the Colorado as far as I know.

27:25.519 --> 27:28.823
And then there's undoubtedly six more like that. 
And out of curiosity, you think anthropological

27:30.490 --> 27:34.695
sites can locate these? That's how we locate it. 
Because the Indians had a real mythology about the

27:37.239 --> 27:52.819
trek, the salt trek, which was kind of a young 
manhood trek to go down in this great canyon and

27:37.239 --> 27:52.819
climb down these cliffs and gather the salt and 
bring it back. And that's all recorded in 1896.

27:56.659 --> 27:58.542
That's where we found it. We even found the old 
ladder that the first man who went down there early

27:59.023 --> 28:09.139
in the century had built to get down one of these 
cliffs, all full of salt drift and crystals of

27:59.023 --> 28:09.139
salt. What made you decide to check 
anthropological literature? Well, it's obvious

28:13.446 --> 28:18.975
that if she was going to find out what the Indian 
names of these damn streams are, they'd surely

28:13.446 --> 28:18.975
know whether they had salt in them or not.

28:22.533 --> 28:24.396
And, of course, the Indus does the same thing. I 
mean, it's easy. There's a place called Salt

28:25.579 --> 28:28.183
Mountain or Salt Hill. It's by Sarco. And it flows 
into the Indus. Salt water.

28:37.761 --> 28:39.023
Anyway, that's only part of it. But it's 
interesting, it seems to me. And it's an

28:42.430 --> 28:45.435
interesting commentary on our bureaucracy.
