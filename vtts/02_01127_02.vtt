WEBVTT

00:01.448 --> 00:02.830
And the impact of that. Also, we were building out 
here, which is a whole new area, and there weren't

00:03.892 --> 00:11.504
builders and workmen and so forth in the area. So we 
went all through that in, let's say, the end of 73,

00:11.524 --> 00:18.955
most, I mean, end of 72, all 73. We opened in October 
of 74. And about that time, it just went nosedive

00:22.661 --> 00:25.465
again. And then we cut away back in 75. 76 
residential sales start picking up a little bit.

00:33.476 --> 00:35.259
Things start getting a little better in 77. Then 
they really start going up like this and really

00:36.140 --> 00:45.575
starting looking fantastic about 79 and 80 and 81 
and 82 and then going right down again. Now we're

00:46.376 --> 00:53.767
just kind of going up again on the scale because 
we're hearing of more deals. People are looking

00:54.128 --> 00:56.852
for large hunks of space. People are looking 
around, thinking of doing buildings. So we see

01:00.276 --> 01:02.659
things happening, and things are getting better. 
We're going to remodel this building over here,

01:04.542 --> 01:10.551
which was the Superior Oil building until Mobil 
bought them out. Mobil bought them out and cleaned

01:10.611 --> 01:13.194
out the company. We got the building back, so we're 
going to remodel that building and try to put that

01:13.996 --> 01:18.182
back on the market. We've got the whole building is 
empty, 80,000 feet. So we're going to remodel

01:24.050 --> 01:25.472
that. We're remodeling the first floor lobby of 
the Bank One building. So we're now doing several

01:32.069 --> 01:34.853
things. We're planning for new commercial 
developments, shopping centers, malls, and so

01:34.913 --> 01:41.883
forth. We're doing remodeling of existing 
buildings to upgrade the quality of those

01:42.484 --> 01:51.797
buildings, and then we're building some new 
buildings, both here and in That all sounds kind of

01:52.351 --> 01:55.175
seat-of-the-pants. Is it seat-of-the-pants, or 
do you employ market analysis firms or whatever to

01:55.655 --> 02:06.970
look around and give you suggestions and ideas? 
Yeah, I'd say that, well, let's see, what would be

02:08.331 --> 02:11.856
an example? If we were going to do an office 
building We would do a market survey in terms of

02:15.082 --> 02:23.030
what are the demands for that kind of space to try to 
give an idea of what size building we should do. And

02:24.071 --> 02:32.640
what we would then do is develop a budget based on 
that program, get the total project budget

02:24.071 --> 02:32.640
prepared. Then we'd run a performa on the building 
to determine can we really, of course, a lot of

02:32.680 --> 02:43.772
them, once they see the pants, it's just using 
judgment based on You know, your own knowledge or

02:44.073 --> 02:48.339
what you can get from consultants. If we're going 
to do, let's say, we want to do another small

02:49.020 --> 03:00.895
village shopping center, we'll bring in a market 
consultant, for example. He will then gather up

03:01.176 --> 03:07.784
all the data that we have from, say, Mel DePay, who 
does all our market research. And he can then see

03:08.505 --> 03:13.472
how many people are living in that area right now 
What's the potential for growth in that area based

03:13.874 --> 03:20.805
on our development plans and what the growth has 
been historically? And then he could say, well,

03:21.766 --> 03:36.810
you can justify to build, let's say, 100,000 
square feet here, but you need to have maybe 50,000

03:21.766 --> 03:36.810
square feet this year, 75 this year, and then max 
out 100 at that year. And if you do that, and if you

03:37.094 --> 03:44.442
have this kind of a store, and then you have these 
ancillary type of facilities here, I think it'll

03:37.094 --> 03:44.442
work. We say, OK. So we then go through the land plan 
to try to see if we can get a site, get the thing to

03:46.885 --> 03:51.209
work. Then we will get cost estimates on that, as I 
say, do a budget, do a performa. Let's say

03:59.678 --> 04:01.480
everything goes smoothly that way. It doesn't 
always go that way. Rarely ever goes that way.

04:06.018 --> 04:07.841
proceed to go ahead and build it. Is Hallmark doing 
the marketing for the mall? Yeah, well, we've done

04:10.765 --> 04:12.368
it jointly with them. But there, you're talking 
about a very long area, I mean, large area. They go

04:17.055 --> 04:22.783
as far south as FM 1960 and go north to Conroe or even 
Huntsville. It's a regional mall. Now, that

04:24.245 --> 04:26.729
construction is actually destroyed on there? No, 
no, no, no. I wish it had. Where are you? We're on a

04:30.672 --> 04:32.555
standstill there. Part of that is due to hard 
times, economy, and Sears store. You see,

04:38.904 --> 04:41.727
Hallmark is part of Sears. The intent was to bring 
Sears in as one of the first stores. Sears is having

04:47.175 --> 04:50.560
financial problems.

04:51.641 --> 04:53.304
They've been trying to get Sears in here. We've 
been saying, look, we'd better let's drop Sears

04:53.664 --> 04:58.231
and let's try to bring in someone else. So that's 
what we're trying to do right now. We've got

05:00.372 --> 05:02.494
Dillard's committed to open. We need to get 
another one to start the first phase of the

05:03.975 --> 05:06.938
development. Yeah, because don't you anchor 
those things? Yeah. Oh, yeah. The mall is designed

05:10.842 --> 05:15.046
to have, depending on how you want to count it, five 
or six anchors. And it's designed so that we can do

05:16.107 --> 05:27.358
the top part of the mall starting with two anchors 
up here, two major department stores, which would

05:16.107 --> 05:27.358
be like Dillard's and Sears. But, you know, we 
could go with Dillard's and maybe Foley's or

05:27.659 --> 05:35.976
Dillard's and maybe Penny's or, you know, 
something like that. So we're in the process of

05:36.717 --> 05:41.747
trying to see if we can pin someone down and make a 
commitment to go in.

05:44.873 --> 05:47.458
And where would that leave Hallmark, the 
management firm? Oh, Hallmark. Hobart is

05:49.057 --> 05:50.659
independent. The development company is 
independent. They can operate independently of

05:52.400 --> 05:58.066
Sears as a department store. However, they're 
owned by the same company. They say they're

06:01.429 --> 06:07.535
independent, but I notice that they seem to be 
pretty tied to try to get Sears in. But we're

06:07.975 --> 06:11.418
saying, look, time's going by and we need to get 
this going. And the thing is that the Houston

06:11.458 --> 06:18.405
economy, while it's improved, is still not, you 
know, isn't that buoyant of an economy. Greens

06:21.593 --> 06:26.638
Point Mall is our closest mall, and that's 
probably 10 miles from here south of us. And it's

06:27.479 --> 06:29.722
kind of rocky right now. Lord & Taylor, which is 
their quality store, has moved out. And that's

06:34.628 --> 06:38.732
brought, I think, the level of quality of that 
center down. I think the population in that area

06:39.493 --> 06:43.798
has shifted. Oh, it has. Sorry, it's this way over 
here. Yeah, well, it's shifted in at the Economic

06:48.440 --> 06:50.303
base of that area is lower. So they're looking at 
that, and they're saying, well, look, if we build a

06:51.064 --> 06:57.815
store here, all the people in this area are going to 
go there. They're not going to go down to our

06:57.835 --> 07:05.127
existing store down there, and the existing store 
is not doing that well, so why should we build

06:57.835 --> 07:05.127
another store up here? Dealers will go in here 
because he doesn't have a store down there. Yeah,

07:10.355 --> 07:10.836
he does. Huh? Is there a deal? Oh, that's right. 
They took over Joski's. Yeah. It's a smaller

07:15.962 --> 07:16.763
store. That's right. They took over Joski's, I 
think. Is it Joski's? No. There is no Joski's down

07:22.089 --> 07:23.350
there. No. Who did they take over Joski's? Huh? 
Yeah, they took over Joski's. Yeah. I was looking

07:27.955 --> 07:30.618
at the Galleria where they... Yeah, there is a 
dealer. It's at Green's Point, isn't there? Yeah.

07:34.602 --> 07:34.782
That's... They took over another store. It was 
Joski's. I don't go there. I think Galleria. There

07:40.851 --> 07:43.134
was a Dillard's and a Joski's, wasn't it? There was 
a Joski's there. It was a separate freestanding

07:45.457 --> 07:49.182
store right across the street from the Galleria, 
right. And Foley's, our anchor in colonization is

07:49.462 --> 07:56.011
Foley's and Dillard's. Yes, right. How's the 
enrollment at A&M? Is it still going up? Well,

08:03.905 --> 08:06.428
they've capped it. Have they? Yeah. From what I 
hear in the Senate, they've got some enrollment

08:08.271 --> 08:13.717
management things that are working. Which aren't 
working, but in terms of actual leading it, I don't

08:13.737 --> 08:18.343
know. Anyway, we've got about $41,000. Yeah, my 
daughter went to A&M. Benching? Yeah, through

08:22.669 --> 08:23.630
agriculture. In what field was she? She got her 
bachelor's in agriculture economics, and then

08:28.576 --> 08:39.148
she took her graduate degree also in 
agri-economics, but her major emphasis was in

08:28.576 --> 08:39.148
international trade. So she's now with the 
Foreign Agriculture Service. Travels all over

08:43.233 --> 08:44.254
the world. That's exciting. Represents the U.S. 
government and the rice market. Oh, no kidding.

08:50.942 --> 08:51.843
You have to read my book. I have a long history of the 
American rice industry. Really? Yes, sir. She

08:55.007 --> 08:55.748
would enjoy that. How current is your book? Last 
year? Oh, I'd like to get a copy of that. Yeah, in

09:03.002 --> 09:09.249
fact, she's delivering a speech in Kansas or 
someplace today. That was an exciting project.

09:12.433 --> 09:13.534
Really, yeah. She knows everybody. I mean, she 
knows all the rice people in Thailand. But this

09:18.119 --> 09:21.383
woman is just going to be translated into 
Japanese? Yeah, Japanese. Well, her last trip,

09:22.504 --> 09:26.308
she went to Seoul, Tokyo. Jakarta,

09:27.875 --> 09:31.540
Bangkok. That's a fascinating world. It goes way 
back, too. Oh, it's real interesting. I know. It's

09:35.725 --> 09:37.468
real interesting. I didn't know anything about 
it. I mean, I grew up in the city. I didn't know

09:40.151 --> 09:41.653
anything about agriculture. A friend of mine, 
Clive Harston, who just retired from . Did you know

09:47.521 --> 09:49.764
a Dr. Cook in agriculture? Yeah. Dr. Cook was her 
mentor. In fact, she was interested in coming back

09:53.963 --> 09:56.827
here. We were sidetracking. And he's at 
University of Missouri. And he was trying to

10:00.852 --> 10:04.156
encourage her to come. What's going to happen? 
Well, I think if the Houston economy can just keep

10:06.840 --> 10:19.716
picking up, even if it's gradual, I think that 
we're just on the threshold of doing our greatest

10:06.840 --> 10:19.716
work here in the woodlands. I just see it just going 
like this. prefer that the economy just creep up

10:23.579 --> 10:31.189
gradually and solid base, rather than this big 
spikes of boom and bust kind of thing. And then we

10:31.869 --> 10:34.973
can develop very nicely. And I think with the 
regional mall and what that would do to this whole

10:35.073 --> 10:45.286
area, the spin-off of developments around malls, 
have you seen up in Bryan College Station area or

10:35.073 --> 10:45.286
anywhere else? We'll build office buildings 
around here. That's why we're doing this plan

10:47.409 --> 10:49.131
here. We're now talking about large office 
buildings. I mean, we're really starting about

10:52.231 --> 10:54.353
going big time. I just hope I can stay around to see 
it all happen. Well, you know, that's what I've

10:57.277 --> 10:59.741
since been talking about. Because I've suffered 
through this all these years, hanging out with my

10:59.761 --> 11:04.507
short fingernails. Now I'd like to stay here and 
enjoy and see this tremendous, what I think should

11:04.587 --> 11:11.156
be really tremendous development. I mean, we made 
an offer to buy that downtown site, to build that

11:11.436 --> 11:17.744
tower downtown Houston. What's that? Gottlieb 
called that super block. Is that an internal kind

11:21.381 --> 11:25.205
of thing? No, it's one block, downtown Houston, 
right across from Shell Plaza. If you know where

11:31.551 --> 11:33.332
Shell is, Shell is right here. Tenneco is here. Two 
Shells here. The old Bank of the Southwest is right

11:36.075 --> 11:37.837
here. There's just a block right there. Bank of 
Southwest owned the land. They were going to build

11:43.502 --> 11:46.285
that Bank of Southwest Tower. They had an 
architectural competition in the 80s. And Murphy

11:49.203 --> 11:54.508
Yan, Helmut Yan, architect from Chicago, won the 
design competition. And they were going to build

11:55.448 --> 11:56.589
that building. They, in fact, tore down a 20-story 
building that was on the site for that building.

12:02.294 --> 12:07.419
Well, again, they were ready to go ahead, and the 
economy went down, and they didn't do it. And, of

12:08.400 --> 12:15.766
course, then Bank of Southwest merged into become 
M-Bank. And, of course, later they went bankrupt.

12:18.565 --> 12:45.062
m corp then became then they went bankrupt so we had 
offered to buy the site and we were well along i had i

12:18.565 --> 12:45.062
was working with helen young from chicago we were 
revising plans to come and do maybe about a

12:18.565 --> 12:45.062
75-story office building it was a gigantic 
project that's the kind of project you get into and

12:18.565 --> 12:45.062
you'd be into it for four or five years we i had done 
the budgets and we were around Last budget I did was

12:46.814 --> 12:52.840
around $400, $450 million to do that building. 
Incredible projects. I mean, they're so, you

12:54.882 --> 13:02.229
know, you get into things like, you know, the 
building's that tall, you know, with wind, they

12:54.882 --> 13:02.229
want to move like that. Well, it's the first turn in 
time I've heard of a tuned mass damper. It's like a

13:06.113 --> 13:15.522
huge block of concrete up there that's tuned so 
that when the building wants to go this way, this

13:06.113 --> 13:15.522
thing is moving that way, and vice versa, to stop 
the building from swaying. And then you get into

13:19.904 --> 13:24.868
the analysis of the elevators, the mechanical 
systems, and the security systems. I mean, it's

13:24.928 --> 13:28.131
just like a little world into all of itself. That 
building, when it moves, every piece of metal, and

13:28.171 --> 13:35.478
glass, and roof, and everything's all moving at 
the same time. How does all that move and stay

13:35.498 --> 13:37.000
together? Could it just fly apart? Do you 
anticipate that happening, something happening

13:40.323 --> 13:42.365
now? Well, I think. I don't know if we're going to be 
running out and doing a building like that. It

13:48.339 --> 13:49.701
would be exciting if we would. But the reason we are 
even looking at doing that is that the Shell Oil

13:49.801 --> 13:58.252
Company was looking for a million square feet of 
space. And it wasn't available if they were to move

13:59.854 --> 14:03.539
and go into another building. And if we could have 
got the Shell Oil Company to have agreed to enter

14:03.999 --> 14:14.753
into an agreement with us, that would have given us 
the basis to build that building. a multi-million

14:15.560 --> 14:21.328
dollar development like that, you have to have a 
major tenant in there to... It's not built on spec.

14:25.093 --> 14:28.338
No, you go bankrupt overnight trying to do 
something like that. So we were moving along

14:29.039 --> 14:43.879
pretty well, but then the MCORP was in bankruptcy, 
and the bankruptcy court judge said that they

14:29.039 --> 14:43.879
couldn't sell the site to us. although they had 
agreed to sell it to us, and said that there had to be

14:44.652 --> 14:57.957
an auction to let any developer come in who wanted 
to to buy that site in competition with us. Mr.

14:57.977 --> 15:02.505
Mitchell decided then that he would withdraw his 
offer to buy it. And one of the other problems is

15:04.148 --> 15:07.875
that we were moving quickly trying to you know, get 
the designs done, try to secure financing. Our

15:12.299 --> 15:22.216
treasurer, George Lake, was working with people 
in New York, and I think he had engaged Goldman

15:12.299 --> 15:22.216
Sachs to try to then raise the funds to finance the 
project. Well, we were just getting underway with

15:22.256 --> 15:27.606
that when the judge said, oh, no, you're going to 
have to have this auction. And we said, well, you

15:27.686 --> 15:29.248
know, we're not ready. No, you're going to have the 
auction. So Mr. Mitchell decided to withdraw our

15:32.375 --> 15:37.884
offer to buy it, let them go have the auction. They 
had the auction, and no one bid.

15:42.633 --> 15:43.815
Does that put you back in? Well, the site's still 
there, but also at the same time, the Shell Oil

15:43.995 --> 15:55.615
Company decided to work with the Heinz Company, 
who are the managers of the building that they're

15:43.995 --> 15:55.615
in, to remodel their space to suit their 
requirements and to stay there, which may have

15:56.236 --> 16:05.027
been part of their strategy all along. One

16:05.367 --> 16:09.111
other thing. We asked you, how does the 
transportation element of the infrastructure of

16:09.131 --> 16:19.183
the woodlands affect your planning, designing? 
How has that? How does it? Our planning department

16:26.105 --> 16:39.422
has the prime responsibility for doing the 
overall general plan and then maintaining the

16:26.105 --> 16:39.422
planning, working with the commercial and 
residential divisions for their areas. They

16:40.363 --> 16:45.570
employ consultants who do traffic planning, 
traffic analysis. They'll study the present

16:47.012 --> 16:54.762
population at the Woodlands, what the growth 
patterns are, and then they'll say from there, You

16:55.147 --> 17:00.933
need this road, this road, this road, this road is 
what you need if you want to do that kind of

16:55.147 --> 17:00.933
development. If you don't do that, you can do this, 
this, and this. So they'll then come in and give us

17:04.656 --> 17:07.599
options. We'll then go through a lot of discussion 
and thinking about it and say, OK, we're going to do

17:07.980 --> 17:15.527
this, this, and this. And then that kind of lays the 
bare bones framework for what we will develop. In

17:21.995 --> 17:34.175
other words, if you have a road that's two lanes 
wide and if you want to have adequate

17:21.995 --> 17:34.175
transportation, meaning automobiles, that's 
not just bumper to bumper. If you want to have

17:34.515 --> 17:46.855
people be able to drive, they have categories of 
service going from like A to D or E. And probably if

17:34.515 --> 17:46.855
you took, you know, if you got on a freeway and you 
could just drive 65 miles an hour without ever

17:47.712 --> 17:52.317
slowing down, that's probably category A. If 
you're downtown on the Southwest Freeway at 5

17:53.198 --> 18:01.308
o'clock and you're bumper to bumper, that's 
probably category D or E. So there's that range of

17:53.198 --> 18:01.308
service. That's how they talk about it. So if you 
want to have, say, category C or B, and if it's a

18:03.951 --> 18:13.922
two-lane road, then you can do, let's say... you 
can do a million square feet, let's say, in this

18:14.898 --> 18:17.722
area. All right? If you put a four-lane road in 
there and you want to have the same category of

18:19.905 --> 18:27.796
service, then maybe you can do three million 
square feet. You want to put a six-lane road in

18:28.236 --> 18:31.681
there so it goes like that. And then it determines 
are you having surface connections? Are you going

18:36.187 --> 18:37.489
to have overpasses? Then, of course, you get into 
the consequences of the cost of that and things

18:38.330 --> 18:43.858
like that. The traffic planning is very

18:44.007 --> 19:03.850
much welded into the whole planning process 
because we have to not only plan the roads for the

18:44.007 --> 19:03.850
service of these areas, but we have to lay out the 
roads so that we have developable parcels of land.

19:04.611 --> 19:11.179
You don't want to have a lot of odd shapes and pieces 
because you can't build in them very well or no one

19:04.611 --> 19:11.179
will want to buy it. Normally, they want a nice 
regular piece of land that has certain dimensions

19:11.547 --> 19:16.832
to it to make the thing work. And we generally know 
that if you have, say, 250 feet from here to here,

19:16.872 --> 19:25.801
that generally satisfies most buyers' 
requirements as to what they might want to do. So

19:26.922 --> 19:28.664
traffic planning is very important. Most of our 
traffic, well, all of our traffic planning is

19:29.404 --> 19:33.188
surface roads. The planning department has been 
working for years on a concept of trying to have

19:34.049 --> 19:39.394
a... like a shuttle bus system that would run east 
and west through the woodlands, and primarily in

19:39.982 --> 19:49.093
what we call this town center area. And they had 
carried the plans to quite a stage, and I think they

19:50.154 --> 19:59.605
were going to make an application to the 
Department of Transportation, but I don't think

19:50.154 --> 19:59.605
it ever went through. Any rail talk at all, ever? 
Well, no. I think that Spine... transit system

20:08.028 --> 20:09.670
they were talking about. At one time, they thought 
it might be light rail, but I think that they really

20:09.710 --> 20:15.455
felt that the cost of that would be prohibitive. 
And I think that they were thinking that it would be

20:15.475 --> 20:25.806
a spine, all right, going right through, but it 
would probably be like a bus system, shuttle bus

20:15.475 --> 20:25.806
system. Or maybe all of a sudden, or helicopter pad 
type things, feasible as transportation

20:25.826 --> 20:32.853
devices? We've had helicopter pads since we 
opened. When we opened the Woodlands, we created a

20:35.652 --> 20:41.498
pad site right south of here where Woodlands 
Parkway. See, Woodlands Parkway in the future is

20:42.359 --> 20:45.862
going to go over Groves Mill Road like so. Well, 
right now we come up like that and we stop and we take

20:46.523 --> 20:50.407
the feeder road going across. So we create a 
landing pad for helicopters. It's used quite

20:53.330 --> 20:56.193
regularly. It's not a commercial pad. It's not a 
heliport, but it is a landing pad. And then we

21:01.979 --> 21:03.280
created another one. over by the first golf 
course, but I don't think that one ever got used.

21:08.021 --> 21:10.224
What about the medical center? I don't think a 
medical, wait a minute, let's think. We've got a

21:13.389 --> 21:14.531
garage there.

21:18.176 --> 21:22.362
I can't remember if we have a pad on top of the garage 
of that medical center or not. You've got the

21:22.562 --> 21:27.029
ambulance entries on the top level of the garage. I 
can't remember if we have a helicopter pad in there

21:28.150 --> 21:30.634
or not. I know one thing I would ask you about is the 
university. Where is that going? Well, that was

21:36.359 --> 21:38.623
bad timing. As I said, I had, when I was with the 
University of Houston, had got the agreement all

21:39.825 --> 21:56.571
resolved for the donation of 400 acres of land, 
really prime land, to the University of Houston.

21:56.591 --> 21:59.035
The coordinating board are the ones who really 
started this. the coordinating board became the

21:59.318 --> 22:02.020
ones who were against it. And if you listen to the 
coordinating board, he's still there. He was like

22:08.426 --> 22:10.688
director of facilities in those days. I think he's 
still head of it, or has he left? Not Gordon Flack.

22:16.273 --> 22:16.894
Ashworth. Ken Ashworth. Ken Ashworth was 
director of facilities when I was at the

22:18.716 --> 22:22.139
University of Houston. He went and got his 
doctorate when he was working there at UT. and then

22:28.040 --> 22:30.182
came back to be the commissioner. Gordon Flack, I 
think, who is now retired. I don't know if you know

22:33.706 --> 22:34.647
those people. I don't know Ashworth. I don't know 
Flack. But I think when Ashworth came in, looking

22:36.990 --> 22:57.152
at it from his viewpoint, he saw that universities 
and colleges were getting established around

22:36.990 --> 22:57.152
Texas for political reasons. in many cases, 
weren't really justified in terms of the

22:57.402 --> 23:06.433
population and enrollment served, like, say, 
Permian Basin, for example. You take a look at that

23:06.473 --> 23:07.835
whole area. I mean, I was very much into taking a 
look at population growth, enrollment trends,

23:07.995 --> 23:20.751
and all this, because the University of Houston 
really was using its facilities much better than

23:07.995 --> 23:20.751
any other institution in the state. I mean, of 
course, people at A&M and UT would like to hear

23:21.492 --> 23:25.397
that, or they wouldn't agree with it. But I know 
that they were. because they were being intensely

23:27.018 --> 23:33.029
used because they didn't have the space that UT and 
AM had. And you know when most professors like to

23:33.049 --> 23:47.594
teach, and then you get into the, I can't remember 
the terms we used, but it really dealt with percent

23:33.049 --> 23:47.594
of occupancy and classroom utilization and all 
that stuff. I can't even remember the terms

23:47.614 --> 23:51.321
anymore, but I remember we got into all those 
studies. and how I was trying to advocate that if we

23:52.077 --> 23:59.445
could get all the professors to start at 8 o'clock 
and quit at 6, we could even do better. Of course,

23:59.745 --> 24:02.929
that went about like that in the academic sense. 
But, you know, but like, well, I don't want to get

24:04.010 --> 24:14.862
into a lot of stuff, but there were institutions 
that had been approved in state legislatures that

24:04.010 --> 24:14.862
had never been approved for political reasons. 
And I think the... The Victoria campus,

24:17.440 --> 24:21.104
University of Houston, was one that I don't think 
should have ever... I was in that initial meeting

24:21.124 --> 24:24.447
when those people came and talked to us. 
University of Houston didn't go out for that. They

24:26.089 --> 24:26.910
came to us. Or came to the University of Houston and 
said, we want to get this. And I think maybe A&M

24:30.613 --> 24:35.078
didn't want to do it or something. I don't think A&M 
wanted to do that. In fact, when University of

24:37.020 --> 24:41.465
Houston... I was told by Pat Nicholson, who was 
there during all those... period when they were

24:45.352 --> 24:49.138
trying to get the University of Houston to become a 
state-supported. The University of Houston had

24:49.679 --> 24:52.444
gone to the University of Texas. And I don't know if 
they ever gone to A&M and said, we'd like to be a part

24:53.726 --> 24:57.772
of your system. Well, I didn't know that. And they 
said no. Nowadays, I mean, in the last 20 years,

25:00.797 --> 25:05.465
they would have loved to have that. Oh, yeah. A&M 
would have loved to have it too. Oh, yeah. But A&M

25:08.116 --> 25:12.661
had dropped Arlington and everything they could 
for a while. Well, as you probably know, there was a

25:12.701 --> 25:19.768
lot of politics and a lot of decisions that were 
made, like the downtown college that the

25:12.701 --> 25:19.768
university required. That was political, too. 
But anyway, so back to that story. I think Ashworth

25:27.036 --> 25:37.347
rightfully saw that a lot of that was happening and 
that it was costing the state of Texas a lot of money

25:27.036 --> 25:37.347
to support, maintain, continue this. They've got 
to put a lid on this and stop this proliferation of

25:37.698 --> 25:47.650
colleges and universities throughout the state, 
try to get some handle on how the state's going to

25:37.698 --> 25:47.650
develop. Now, California had, I think, an 
excellent system. There may be prejudice coming

25:52.235 --> 26:04.009
from California, but they had the University of 
California, and that took the top, I think, 12.5%

25:52.235 --> 26:04.009
of the high school enrollment. Then they had the 
state college system that took a top 33%. And then

26:10.210 --> 26:13.814
any student graduated from high school could go to 
the community college system. They had an

26:13.854 --> 26:16.838
excellent community college system. Maybe 200

26:18.120 --> 26:22.546
community colleges. And it was free. You went free 
to community college. And if you can make it there,

26:26.351 --> 26:31.558
then you could apply to either go to a state college 
or to the university. There's one university.

26:34.145 --> 26:39.431
University of California, and then the state 
colleges, which, of course, the state colleges

26:34.145 --> 26:39.431
never liked to be called state colleges. They 
later became called state universities. But I

26:42.674 --> 26:44.877
knew that system well. The state government had 
adopted the plan. State Department of Finance

26:48.881 --> 26:50.302
went along. State University of California had 
done a restudy of population back in the 50s or so.

26:58.972 --> 27:04.017
And that's what laid out the whole plan for the 
Development University of California, which

26:58.972 --> 27:04.017
then recommended the establishment of the major 
campuses of the university, and to establish one

27:04.840 --> 27:13.328
at Santa Cruz, San Diego, Irvine. There was an 
excellent system. Texas never had a plan like

27:14.629 --> 27:16.631
that. And it's been a free-for-all scramble. All 
that stuff is really out there. It's just not been .

27:22.917 --> 27:26.440
But that's what the coordinating board has been 
trying to do. I mean, in the good old days, anybody

27:26.500 --> 27:31.465
want to start a new department of history, go start 
a department of history. Gottlieb this morning,

27:31.485 --> 27:33.447
though, said or see if I remember this right, it was 
his impression that had Mr. Mitchell gone with

27:35.215 --> 27:46.747
either UT or A&M. Could have had it. Oh, yeah. 
Because you probably know Mr. Mitchell is a

27:50.692 --> 27:54.996
graduate of A&M, been a great supporter of A&M. But 
he's always felt the University of Houston really

27:56.738 --> 28:03.265
serves the Houston community. despite what UT and 
A&M think, provide pretty good education for

28:04.055 --> 28:15.685
people who cannot afford to go to A&M and UT, and has 
done an excellent job. He felt that a campus here

28:16.205 --> 28:23.771
should be related to the University of Houston 
system as such, rather than A&M. He felt strong

28:25.433 --> 28:27.495
about it, and that was it. He's had friends of his 
who said to him, George, you've got an excellent

28:28.395 --> 28:33.960
idea, but you've got the wrong university. And I'm 
sure he's been said, if you go A&M or UT, you'll get

28:34.582 --> 28:38.426
it. So anyway, back to your question. We got the 400 
acres, donated to University of Houston about

28:41.529 --> 28:57.445
this time, coordinating board afterwards, 
restudying the whole, even though they said you

28:41.529 --> 28:57.445
should expand, start to look back maybe seven or 
eight years later and saying, well, things are

28:41.529 --> 28:57.445
really ongoing. This is really a mess. We've got to 
get some organization here. We can't let people

29:00.704 --> 29:04.790
start new camps because it costs the state a lot of 
money. And so they put a clamp on it. Dr. Hoffman

29:08.275 --> 29:13.123
went to the coordinating board to make a petition 
to try to get them to approve it. People from the

29:13.964 --> 29:27.344
Huntsville area, Sam Houston and that, were 
fighting politically to fight against it because

29:13.964 --> 29:27.344
they thought that that would seriously affect the 
enrollment at Sam Houston State University. Got

29:28.045 --> 29:29.547
the support of one of their local state 
legislators to come and argue against it. And it

29:33.978 --> 29:38.022
didn't get approved, and that was really the last 
big opportunity to get through. There had been

29:38.042 --> 29:41.345
other attempts after that time, but never struck. 
The land is still there, and Houston still has it?

29:43.608 --> 29:45.209
No, the land is gone now. It's been used for other 
purposes. So you really don't anticipate that

29:47.792 --> 29:49.313
it's going to happen? I don't anticipate it coming 
and happening. If it does, it'll be a long time from

29:53.277 --> 29:55.840
now. That's unfortunate, because I think Mr. 
Mitchell's correct, that would be an integral

29:59.513 --> 30:05.599
element in the development of the community. Oh, 
it would have been wonderful. Yeah, we had the area

30:07.261 --> 30:08.963
all planned. It was on the other side of Lake 
Woodlands. He felt that this would give an

30:11.726 --> 30:18.373
opportunity for students in Montgomery County, 
because there isn't anything beyond the 12th

30:11.726 --> 30:18.373
grade here. And also, it would be a 
state-supported institution. So, I mean, the

30:23.218 --> 30:25.661
concept was great. The timing politically mean 
politically in terms of the state and everything

30:28.117 --> 30:32.283
was just unfortunate. And maybe if, you know, 
maybe if Dr. Hoffman had, maybe if he had had the

30:34.286 --> 30:44.300
opportunity to line up political forces himself, 
it may have happened. But there are too many other,

30:44.320 --> 30:52.291
you know, jealousies and territorial things 
going along that were working against it by that

30:44.320 --> 30:52.291
time. That's my view of the thing. So anyway, the 
Woodlands lost having a campus at the University

30:55.977 --> 30:58.982
of Houston. We tried to create a center here. And we 
had it in a building up the road here to try to get

31:02.547 --> 31:08.497
something started by offering courses. But that 
became real hard to try to get professors to come

31:08.557 --> 31:13.104
from the University of Houston and come here and do 
that. And that's about when David Gottlieb got

31:13.805 --> 31:22.980
involved, because he got involved in this little 
center that we were starting.

31:24.952 --> 31:29.377
Well, we're about to run out of your time, but would 
you wrap us up? I know a while ago you said that you

31:29.477 --> 31:36.446
see great times ahead for the woodlands in terms of 
population growth. Yeah, well, in terms of our

31:36.466 --> 31:39.489
commercial development. Do you think that kind of 
expansion that you anticipate will change the

31:40.691 --> 31:52.825
complexion, the environment in the woodlands? Do 
you anticipate much change? It'll change the

31:56.626 --> 32:03.612
appearance of this whole town center area as it 
develops towards the mall and around the mall with

31:56.626 --> 32:03.612
things like this. It's going to make a big change. 
But I think the change is going to be one of quality.

32:11.239 --> 32:19.446
And while it'll introduce a more urban character, 
I think it's going to be a splendid contrast

32:11.239 --> 32:19.446
between what we have now and what we have there. And 
I think this will then start to give more of a focus

32:20.026 --> 32:25.671
of a downtown compared to what we have now You know, 
we've got a group of buildings here and some

32:26.090 --> 32:30.695
buildings here, but there's no focus to the area. 
And I think this will give some real center, real

32:30.875 --> 32:36.000
focus to this commercial town center 
development. And so I would see that in the future,

32:37.101 --> 32:43.347
we're going to have larger buildings, you know, 
10, 20-story buildings in height. Now, of course,

32:43.828 --> 32:51.135
this is predicated on, hopefully, some slow to 
moderate growth and improvement of the economy of

32:43.828 --> 32:51.135
the Houston area. That would be a major 
centerpiece. That would be a major centerpiece.

32:56.624 --> 33:03.094
Plus, this is really a big window from I-45 into the 
woodlands. Right now, you go by, it's all trees

33:03.154 --> 33:05.157
along here. You don't know anything is here. 
That's an interesting point. That's something

33:09.464 --> 33:12.588
that has always struck me about the woodlands is it 
was a mystery. Yeah, that's right. We say to

33:13.530 --> 33:16.975
ourselves, that was really dumb of us. We should 
have got right down here in the beginning and

33:16.995 --> 33:20.380
started this development. We said, well, other 
people said, well, we ought to start over the

33:20.613 --> 33:24.818
center and work backwards. It's like the dumbbell 
theory of development, where you own this piece of

33:25.959 --> 33:34.549
land, and you develop this and develop this. You do 
that because this becomes more valuable, because

33:34.589 --> 33:40.196
you create the market forces. So we've had 
arguments back and forth. I mean, this mall, when

33:42.118 --> 33:45.422
Pereira designed it, was a way over here. And then 
it's been here and here. Well, anyway, now it's

33:47.938 --> 33:48.999
here. And so if that happens, we can say, well, 
we've got this Pinecroft development that's

33:49.039 --> 33:58.210
going to take place right here. And we've already 
started the land development for a large Target

33:58.250 --> 34:01.694
store. It's going to go up here because this is 
here. So you can see things are going to start

34:04.197 --> 34:05.979
happening. And this will be a gorgeous 
development to drive here. This is going to be

34:09.443 --> 34:11.946
about a 25-acre lake. Looking right across here, 
there's going to be a hotel here. office building

34:15.575 --> 34:37.802
here we're going to have a civic building there 
this will be our first phase of this development

34:15.575 --> 34:37.802
with three office buildings around a very large 
parking structure looking onto this water it'll

34:15.575 --> 34:37.802
be a beautiful development well the details are 
nicely done yeah there's a sense of we put a lot of

34:15.575 --> 34:37.802
effort into the planning of what we do and the 
design. And there's a lot of people participate.

34:43.169 --> 34:48.415
We all have our areas of responsibility, but 
there's a lot of input coming from different

34:43.169 --> 34:48.415
groups. So we put a lot of thought into it, and I 
think the result is that we get good quality. And I

34:56.324 --> 35:06.136
think people, as you come around, you can see the 
quality right down to the signs and the roads and

34:56.324 --> 35:06.136
the landscaping and how we deal with the natural 
environment and everything. All right, sir. We

35:06.737 --> 35:07.838
thank you very much. OK.
