WEBVTT

00:01.195 --> 00:08.290
I understand that those 23 people were augmented 
by a lot of other people during that summer. Oh, I

00:08.811 --> 00:09.693
know that. And that was the next year. And a lot of 
those people I probably never even met, Bob. I

00:15.024 --> 00:16.648
probably never even met them, you know. Yeah, I 
know. That was another series of questions here I

00:17.069 --> 00:21.077
wanted to ask you, as a matter of fact. Says, 
several candidates join other missions, is a

00:21.344 --> 00:26.210
phrase I found. What other missions? Is there an 
Air Force mission? Well, there was a mission on

00:29.154 --> 00:36.344
investigating the chemical industry in Germany. 
And there was a mission in investigating the

00:37.525 --> 00:44.655
metallurgical industry, the coke iron and steel 
industry. And there were at least a half a dozen, or

00:44.755 --> 00:48.820
perhaps even a dozen, separate groups that came 
over later that had nothing to do with the

00:49.475 --> 00:55.588
technical oil mission. But they were all 
functioning over there. And did they write

00:57.572 --> 00:58.955
reports too? They wrote reports too. And I don't 
know where those reports are. All right, they

01:02.603 --> 01:06.907
also, so what you really have then are a series of 
missions going in. A series of missions. And so

01:08.088 --> 01:14.434
there's, hell, I'm just making these names up, 
obviously, but a technical mission on metallurgy

01:08.088 --> 01:14.434
in Germany. And there was a technical mission on 
such things as the oxygen plants. Okay. And the war

01:21.481 --> 01:27.126
gas plants and the chemical plants and things of 
that nature. Everybody got over there, you know.

01:29.048 --> 01:31.530
Did they also touch things on synthetic fuels?

01:35.037 --> 01:43.550
I don't remember ever being involved in any 
reports that I have read about synthetic fuels.

01:48.758 --> 01:54.507
Was there an Air Force

01:48.758 --> 01:54.507
team on synthetic fuels? Yes, I believe there was. 
Is there a difference between the Air Force

01:56.430 --> 01:59.475
reports and the Tom reports? Well, the Air Force 
collected a lot of their own reports.

02:06.855 --> 02:12.825
And I showed you what they had done with the Germans 
last time on having the Germans sit down and write

02:06.855 --> 02:12.825
reports. After we had left, they sat down and got 
the Germans to write reports. And they obviously

02:18.114 --> 02:22.982
had a team over there, but I don't remember meeting 
any of the Air Force people. So we send in, then, in

02:23.772 --> 02:29.920
terms of... Now, I think you've got to look at the 
chronology here a little bit, too. Yeah, okay,

02:30.040 --> 02:30.821
good. Because I went over, if I remember 
correctly, in December of

02:30.841 --> 02:39.932
1944. Uh-huh.

02:43.697 --> 02:48.043
And I was over there until about June of 1945. The 
war had ended in the meantime. But There was a great

02:54.299 --> 03:17.910
deal of work done from June of 1945 by the technical 
oil mission and by the other teams such as the Navy

02:54.299 --> 03:17.910
team and the chemical team and the Air Force team 
and so on and so forth that I had really no knowledge

02:54.299 --> 03:17.910
of, you see. And that went on. They were over there 
for most of the year until the end of the year and

03:20.488 --> 03:26.276
even longer, I think. So they're over there, I 
think, all through 45 and 46. Early 46. Yeah,

03:29.561 --> 03:31.403
presumably. OK.

03:38.814 --> 03:39.915
It. It says, why did you bring additional 
candidates over in 45? It was the next question I

03:44.126 --> 03:48.570
was to ask, but I assume that you answered that, 
that you returned by then. But there seems to be an

03:48.871 --> 03:52.394
influx of new people joining your mission in 45. 
Yeah, there were. And I think as we got into

03:54.456 --> 04:06.308
Germany, that more and more industries and more 
and more people here in the United States got

04:08.617 --> 04:14.224
interested in the idea of investigating this 
German technology as thoroughly as possible. I

04:15.826 --> 04:32.087
think perhaps the technical oil mission and the 
Navy mission were the earliest ones over there,

04:15.826 --> 04:32.087
but as it became known throughout the technical 
industry that it was possible to get into these

04:15.826 --> 04:32.087
German plants and investigate, more and more 
people began to get interested in the thing. So the

04:32.107 --> 04:36.312
thing just spiraled out from a small group to a 
bigger and bigger group. I suppose the Germans

04:37.270 --> 04:41.014
must have gotten pretty tired of this after a 
while. Why were plant managers not as cooperative

04:43.456 --> 04:47.120
as scientists? Who the hell said that? Did I say 
that? Yeah, you said that in the Saturday Evening

04:49.182 --> 04:51.985
Post in 1945. You suggested that plant managers 
might not have been as cooperative as scientists.

04:55.549 --> 05:01.135
There are a couple of accounts of material being 
hidden away that are searched out in various

04:55.549 --> 05:01.135
places. I think that, I very much, I think probably 
that was Ruth Knoll's addition to the article. I

05:08.556 --> 05:11.399
wouldn't, I don't believe I'd substantiate that. 
Okay. As a matter of fact, we had, I don't remember,

05:12.219 --> 05:19.826
I don't remember any Germans that weren't 
recently cooperative, really. Once or twice we

05:22.148 --> 05:30.615
got into a discussion with people and they got 
rather difficult to handle, but it was so seldom

05:22.148 --> 05:30.615
that it was really... I would say almost to no 
consequence.

05:36.511 --> 05:39.254
Was much material lost in terms of collecting 
material? I know that's a very difficult question

05:39.274 --> 05:41.237
to answer. But you seem to have come back. I'm 
afraid to guess how many documents ended back up in

05:43.580 --> 05:48.286
this country. But literally, you're talking 
about 450,000 frames of microfilm or so at a

05:48.326 --> 05:56.737
conservative estimate. Is it that much? Oh, got to 
be, at least. Yeah. I don't know what all involves.

06:05.973 --> 06:15.121
Let me tell you a little story here that will 
probably illustrate what kind of, what happened,

06:05.973 --> 06:15.121
really. You know, we were also interested not only 
in collagenation, but the fissure-tropical

06:16.082 --> 06:23.008
process, as you're well aware. And we went to 
Stark-Roddy-Holton, where the Rorkeme had a

06:24.289 --> 06:30.555
fissure-tropical plant. And when we got to 
Sterk-Rodney Holden,

06:31.953 --> 06:58.315
we went into the plant and we found very few 
documents that dealt with the operation of the

06:31.953 --> 06:58.315
plant, the flow sheet for the plant, the 
experimental work that they had carried out, the

06:31.953 --> 06:58.315
results of their operations, and so on and so 
forth, or exactly how they carried their

06:31.953 --> 06:58.315
operations out. And we talked to a number of people 
there, some of which we brought back later on, like

06:59.864 --> 07:08.157
Dr. Alberts and so on and so forth. And we finally 
learned that practically all the documents on the

07:08.177 --> 07:21.518
fish and drug process had been removed from the 
plants and taken to Magdeburg.

07:22.696 --> 07:27.183
And they were supposed to be in a in Magdeburg. 
Well, my German at that time told me that a was a

07:27.583 --> 07:36.657
water castle, but I couldn't figure out just what 
the hell he meant by a water castle. It turned out to

07:37.438 --> 07:39.381
be a castle with a moat around it. And so we got 
together a group of people. By that time, somehow

07:46.632 --> 07:48.735
we'd got to Frankfurt. And we got together a group 
of about six or eight people. And we decided we'd go

07:53.813 --> 07:57.937
down and investigate this castle at Magdeburg. I 
think this is described in one of the articles that

07:58.117 --> 08:02.121
you've got. And we did find this castle at 
Magdeburg. And in the buildings surrounding it,

08:07.767 --> 08:11.630
it was a castle with a motor on it, of course. And in 
the outer buildings around the castle, we found

08:11.650 --> 08:19.618
most of the documents on the official drug 
process. And we found a good many slides on the

08:20.408 --> 08:23.472
fish. I'm sorry, I wish I hadn't gone. And things of 
that nature. And so

08:30.280 --> 08:39.030
they were literally boxes and boxes of them. And we 
went through the boxes one by one, trying to pick

08:39.050 --> 08:46.939
out the material which we thought was important 
scientific material. And this stuff, we had a

08:47.729 --> 08:52.534
truck and a driver and so on and so forth. So this 
stuff was all loaded into the truck. And there were

08:55.758 --> 09:02.966
literally piles and piles of documents on this, on 
the Fisher-Tropsch operations. Now, I'm sure

09:02.986 --> 09:09.333
that material was all taken back to Frankfurt and 
was ultimately all microfilmed. But we had only

09:09.573 --> 09:17.382
read it

09:09.573 --> 09:17.382
very scantily, very briefly. And from that, I 
don't remember preparing any reports for it, but I

09:18.340 --> 09:28.537
presume that was used to prepare reports on the 
facial drug process when it was brought back to the

09:18.340 --> 09:28.537
United States. And that's why you find all these, I 
mean, whole truckloads of documents were brought

09:28.557 --> 09:39.234
back, and they were all microfilmed and sent back 
to the United States. Hmm, okay. Let me ask some

09:39.735 --> 09:42.760
questions about that while I'm right here. This 
seems a logical place to put it, then. I keep

09:46.403 --> 09:47.866
finding an account. And some of these things I 
might ought to be able to answer, but I really can't

09:48.247 --> 09:54.299
tell because not being a chemist. 468 documents 
are sold from the technical oil mission.

10:02.756 --> 10:04.339
By documents, you mean reports. Must be reports, 
right? That must be what it is. Reports and

10:07.116 --> 10:09.700
material, we collect them over there. All right. 
And so what that microfilm copies are then, or

10:11.181 --> 10:20.954
those must be microfilm copies of reports plus 
addended material, which seemed to back the

10:11.181 --> 10:20.954
reports? Yeah. OK. And this question is not really 
for me. It's for Professor Winerdi.

10:31.066 --> 10:35.732
See, in Science Magazine, you were saying the 
cream off the top of the German oil production had

10:36.067 --> 10:37.149
been collected. And I suppose that was what you 
meant when he asked me about it.

10:49.947 --> 10:52.450
I meant several things by that statement. 
Probably I can't give you the full details of what

10:52.470 --> 11:00.682
goes through my mind when you make a statement like 
that. But

11:00.742 --> 11:05.449
for example,

11:07.876 --> 11:12.501
I think we brought back enough data. In fact, I know 
we brought back enough data. So we were able to

11:15.685 --> 11:21.532
build a 50-barrel-a-day fish and drugs plant in 
Louisiana, Missouri. And that was largely on the

11:21.552 --> 11:28.360
basis of the information we collected in Germany 
about the plants they operated. Now, we didn't

11:28.440 --> 11:37.090
build that plant exactly like the German plant, 
because we had some other ideas we had added into

11:28.440 --> 11:37.090
it. I think we had, in fact, at Louisiana Missouri, 
and during our engineering and construction work

11:37.846 --> 11:50.747
out there, had really creamed off the top of what we 
knew about the fish treatment process. Now, we

11:50.767 --> 11:59.601
also took all of the documents that we could get 
about the fish, about the coalization process,

11:59.918 --> 12:04.663
And they were all taken to Louisiana, Missouri, 
all the ones that we thought would be very helpful

11:59.918 --> 12:04.663
to us. And it was on the basis of those documents, 
plus such assistance as we had from the German

12:04.683 --> 12:16.535
people we brought over, by which we designed the 
collagenation plant at Louisiana, Missouri. And

12:16.675 --> 12:18.517
we made that plant run finally. And it was pretty 
much the same type of plant that they had used in

12:18.657 --> 12:23.682
Germany. Now, by the time we had built that plant, 
we had a whole lot of new ideas, and we revised the

12:26.648 --> 12:33.996
plant considerably and incorporated a lot of 
those new ideas in it. Remember now, we're talking

12:34.016 --> 12:47.470
about 1945 to 1950, when we've got another 10 or 15 
years of technology that we can add in to the German

12:34.016 --> 12:47.470
technology to build this plant. And now, even more 
than that, there were documents brought back on

12:51.742 --> 13:08.912
processes like the so-called OXO process, in 
which you can take an unsaturated hydrocarbon

12:51.742 --> 13:08.912
compound and add CO and hydrogen to it and make 
alcohols and ketones and things like that. And

13:09.273 --> 13:13.260
there were several plants built by the oil company 
on the basis of that technology. And then the whole

13:14.067 --> 13:25.619
acetylene technology, the Germans are quite a 
long ways ahead of us on the acetylene technology,

13:14.067 --> 13:25.619
and the chemical industry picked up the acetylene 
technology and went into that in quite a lot of

13:14.067 --> 13:25.619
detail. So what I meant was that industry and the 
Bureau of Mines and everybody in the United States

13:26.060 --> 13:39.294
has, in fact, had an awfully good look at this 
technology and has, in fact, and is now using that

13:26.060 --> 13:39.294
technology. Do I make myself clear? Sure, you make 
yourself clear. What is the Wright-Patterson Is

13:44.830 --> 13:47.653
there a Wright-Patterson system somehow? 
Wright-Patterson is the airplane locomotive

13:48.053 --> 13:52.418
engine builders. Yeah. Would they, for example, 
have gone back in and looked at the German

13:54.400 --> 13:58.825
technology? I'm sure they did. Well, I'm not sure 
of that, but I imagine they had people over there,

14:01.608 --> 14:12.119
and I suppose they were interested in the airplane 
engines and the airplane fuels and things of that

14:01.608 --> 14:12.119
nature. Yeah, I guess. I want to figure, what, an 
hour and a half later to the airport? Yeah, I'd say

14:20.615 --> 14:31.188
at

14:20.615 --> 14:31.188
least that. I want to ask you some questions about 
Louisiana, Missouri plants and problems I had in

14:31.408 --> 14:42.242
trying to decide what happened there. Were there 
two plants operating there or one plant? We built

14:47.103 --> 14:49.546
both the fissure troops and the coal 
hydrogenation. There were two plants. Two

14:50.988 --> 14:51.529
plants, okay. But they were different size 
plants. The coal hydrogenation was 200 barrels a

14:53.392 --> 14:59.621
day, and the fissure troops was 50, about one 
quarter of the size. Okay. And did you disassemble

15:00.562 --> 15:04.428
a plant and bring it over? No, no. We built it, 
redesigned it, and built it right from scratch.

15:08.233 --> 15:08.494
Okay. Both cases. And you used German plans? Yes. 
Modified German plants. Modified German plants,

15:14.151 --> 15:15.593
all right. Now was there already a plant existing 
there that you modified? Yeah, there was.

15:20.660 --> 15:22.964
Louisiana, Missouri was producing ammonia. 
Okay. And we used the part of the ammonia lines to

15:23.965 --> 15:29.233
make hydrogen. We didn't make our own hydrogen for 
our own coal hydrogenation plant. We made the

15:33.840 --> 15:35.803
hydrogen from natural gas. And this is where the 
synthetic fuel was produced, which ran, for

15:36.965 --> 15:41.450
example, the terrain. Yeah. It comes out of this 
plant. And what did you estimate that a plant, how

15:43.393 --> 15:50.982
much more efficient was this plant than its 
comparable German plant? Well, the actual plant

15:51.903 --> 16:01.916
we built probably wasn't much more than 10% or 15% 
more efficient than a German plant. But on the

16:01.936 --> 16:06.381
basis of what we learned during its construction 
and operating period, We designed a plant which I

16:07.036 --> 16:16.268
think was about double the efficiency of the 
German plant.

16:16.768 --> 16:22.055
I assume there's a report where you discuss how 
efficient this plant would have been. Yeah, there

16:22.095 --> 16:22.395
is. If I could just put my hand on it right now, I'd 
give you a copy. We could make a copy of it. I

16:29.745 --> 16:31.727
probably should have given you...

16:45.190 --> 16:50.779
It's a report by Skinner and Hirsch, as I remember 
it.

17:13.169 --> 17:34.655
thermal

17:13.169 --> 17:34.655
efficiency and we came up with something a little 
over 55%. The Germans were about 30% and you were

17:34.695 --> 17:38.400
about 55%. This is a various section of the plant. 
Hydrogenation proper, improved plant, German

17:44.921 --> 17:49.786
plant, okay. The hydrogenation proper we came up 
with about 73 against 51. The hydrogen

17:53.869 --> 17:55.771
manufacturer we came up with. The Germans were 
very inefficient in hydrogen manufacturing.

17:58.534 --> 18:03.178
That technology had improved amazingly from 27 to 
62. The power plant from 42 to 39. The power plant

18:06.261 --> 18:08.944
actually went down a little bit. Overall 
efficiency, 28.9, and this one is 55. I see. And

18:14.757 --> 18:17.481
this is what, in the industrial engineering, 
chemistry? You want a copy of it? Yeah. Let me have

18:22.109 --> 18:25.675
the girls make the copy of it for us. It's selling 
enough, because the girls are making it. Good.

18:36.430 --> 18:47.684
Now, so all in all, what percentage of synthetic 
oil would you say, or what percentage of national

18:36.430 --> 18:47.684
production of fuel did the Germans produce 
through synthetic oils?

18:51.669 --> 18:53.011
I don't know. I never calculated it. They produced

18:56.495 --> 19:05.847
about 100,000 barrels a day

19:08.375 --> 19:10.118
They're coal-hygienation plants.

19:13.342 --> 19:15.425
And they had seven fish and trout plants. And I 
doubt if those seven fish and trout plants

19:17.148 --> 19:21.655
produced more than 20,000 barrels a day. So we're 
talking 120,000 barrels a day. And I don't know

19:25.460 --> 19:28.545
what their total use is. You might be able to... I'm 
sure you could look it up for those years or the

19:31.249 --> 19:35.475
years just before the war, something like that. 
But... At that time, Bob, we were using about 4

19:38.210 --> 19:46.458
million barrels of oil a day, or 4, 4.5 million 
barrels a day. I suspect that the Germans were down

19:47.318 --> 19:55.206
around 1

19:47.318 --> 19:55.206
million barrels a day, or something in that order. 
So it's probably something in the order of 10% to

19:56.227 --> 20:00.751
15% of total production. Okay? This is a very rough 
figure. Yeah. So it was only really a supplemental

20:05.294 --> 20:08.719
measure, always. Yeah, and of course what they, 
there was two things they used this oil for, to a

20:08.739 --> 20:14.747
considerable extent. The coal hydrogenation oil 
ran a great deal of their Luftwaffe, because it's a

20:15.007 --> 20:23.900
high-octane gasoline, mostly. And the 
fissure-tropical oil they used for a variety of

20:25.221 --> 20:31.470
purposes, but one of the things they used it for was 
for diesel fuel. Okay, Mads, thank you very

20:32.952 --> 20:41.004
much. She left a note and

20:41.024 --> 20:54.785
I didn't see it. Yeah. All right, so there are two 
plants then. How much time did you spend at the

20:56.808 --> 21:00.673
plant? Plants? At the plants. Did you go to the 
plants regularly? When we weren't in London or

21:05.732 --> 21:14.184
trying to get from London to Germany, we were in the 
plants. Oh, I'm sorry. I meant the plants in

21:14.765 --> 21:17.228
Louisiana, Missouri. Oh, in Louisiana, 
Missouri. Oh, I thought you meant the German

21:18.550 --> 21:21.514
plants. Oh, I used to go out there about...

21:27.779 --> 21:29.864
I guess I was traveling every week. But, see, I had 
the Morgantown Laboratory to carry, the Brewston

21:30.004 --> 21:38.344
Laboratory, the Louisiana, Missouri plant, and 
the rifle plant. So probably once a month, two or

21:38.364 --> 21:45.721
three days a month was the best I could do at each 
place. Okay, now... Did the coppers company build

21:47.320 --> 21:50.004
one of the plants? The coppers company built the 
fish and trout plant. But the fish and trout

21:52.067 --> 21:53.549
plants. The Bechtel built the coal hydrogenation 
plant. Did Bechtel do a cost analysis of both

21:56.073 --> 21:59.538
plants? No, Bechtel only did a cost analysis of the 
coal hydrogenation plant. Okay, that's all

22:03.745 --> 22:05.467
right. And I assume they published that. Yeah, 
I've got a copy of it here. Okay. Now that's all

22:12.498 --> 22:16.163
based on 1951 or 1952 figures. Bob, too. And then we 
did our own cost analysis of the Fisher-Tropsch

22:17.371 --> 22:21.277
plant. And was yours substantially different 
from Bechtel's? Well, we worked with Bechtel on

22:25.122 --> 22:29.589
the analysis of the coal hydrogenation plant. And 
so the report that came out from Bechtel was a

22:29.869 --> 22:36.078
Bechtel Bureau of Mines report. Now, later on, we 
cooperated with the petroleum industry in a study

22:37.921 --> 22:45.812
of the coal hydrogenation again. And that came out 
a little higher than the Bechtel plant, but

22:46.552 --> 22:57.165
substantially in the same region.

22:57.185 --> 23:01.330
Bechtel never analyzed the Fisher Trucks plant. 
We did that ourselves. I don't believe we even had

23:02.972 --> 23:04.734
copper samples. We did meet our own cost analysis. 
Fisher Trucks? Yeah.

23:11.898 --> 23:16.582
If you ask me where that is published, I'd probably 
have a hell of a time picking my fingers up. But, you

23:16.602 --> 23:29.934
know, this series of reports on synthetic fuels, 
these annual reports, do have a lot of those cost

23:16.602 --> 23:29.934
studies in it for all three things, oil shale, 
fish, trucks, and coal hydrogenation. And those

23:31.816 --> 23:35.119
annual reports now, those are Bureau of Mines 
reports? Those are Bureau of Mines reports, yeah.

23:37.521 --> 23:38.822
From 1946 to 1952. Yeah, right, right. I have a few 
questions on things that were just sort of vague

23:43.555 --> 23:52.689
towards the end of our interview that I need to have 
some information on. I'll make sure I have these.

23:54.773 --> 24:00.442
And again, I have an advantage over you having both 
written Tom and having read your interview and you

23:54.773 --> 24:00.442
not. I'm

24:00.742 --> 24:05.049
sorry yours didn't arrive here. It was supposed to 
have already been here before I got here.

24:20.309 --> 24:32.545
Now, one of the things you say is that

24:20.309 --> 24:32.545
I think you've answered the question, all kinds of 
cost studies have been done. Are you referring to

24:33.166 --> 24:36.551
those in the 1950s and all kinds of cost studies? 
But I assume from our conversation, all kinds of

24:36.571 --> 24:40.516
cost studies must have been done since the 1950s. 
Oh, yes. Come on in. Thank you very much. MR. Thank

24:46.677 --> 24:46.938
you. Now, will these be summarized in the National 
Committee of Engineers report? MR. Only in the

24:55.346 --> 25:02.313
most general terminology,

24:55.346 --> 25:02.313
Bob. The economics in that report is not detailed. 
It's very, very, there is so much controversy

25:07.498 --> 25:14.245
about this economics we had really to do a sort of an 
overall job to avoid this controversy. And as you

25:23.628 --> 25:37.263
probably know, IRDA has been making cost studies 
literally by the dozens since they have been in

25:23.628 --> 25:37.263
operation, and the Office of Cold Research made 
cost studies and everything else. Let me read you

25:38.784 --> 25:41.127
what I said about that. Bob, these are really my own 
words, and I think the most nearly represents what

25:41.225 --> 25:49.877
I think about the whole damn thing. Although

25:49.938 --> 26:09.105
extensive efforts have been made to accurately 
determine capital costs for the most promising

25:49.938 --> 26:09.105
and most highly developed liquefaction 
processes, those are really the H coal and the

25:49.938 --> 26:09.105
Exxon process now. The results have shown great 
variations, depending not only on the process

26:09.710 --> 26:19.390
selected but also on the many economic and 
engineering judgments involved in the

26:09.710 --> 26:19.390
estimates. Furthermore, estimating has been 
made much more difficult by the inflation that has

26:19.410 --> 26:30.553
occurred during the last five years, and it is 
necessary to talk in terms of ranges rather than

26:19.410 --> 26:30.553
specific figures. Estimates indicate that the 
capital cost of the most promising of the coal

26:31.360 --> 26:56.727
liquefaction processes, and I'm not referring to 
dry coal hydrogenation, I'm just referring to the

26:31.360 --> 26:56.727
existing processes, to produce a synthetic crude 
oil from a plant feeding 25,000 to 50,000 tons of

26:31.360 --> 26:56.727
coal per day will fall...

26:31.360 --> 26:56.727
No, there's an error there, isn't there?

27:00.419 --> 27:03.343
Well, I think they want to check that. Will fall in 
the range of $20,000 to $30,000 per barrel per

27:03.363 --> 27:08.611
operating day. And that's about five times what a 
petroleum refinery costs.

27:16.383 --> 27:19.908
Well, the cost of product will depend mainly on the 
capital and operating costs of the plant. An

27:19.948 --> 27:22.311
additional important factor is the cost of the 
coal. With coals priced from 40 to 120 per million

27:23.012 --> 27:30.223
BTUs, that's in the range from about $8 to $25 a ton. 
The corresponding cost of synthetic crude is $20

27:30.676 --> 27:34.520
to $30 per barrel. And I think that's too low. I 
think it's probably closer to $30 to $40 a barrel,

27:36.862 --> 27:44.971
particularly since this date is a year old now. 
Yeah. Harry?

27:53.640 --> 27:57.544
And so you think then $30 to $40 a barrel is more 
realistic? Of course, synthetic crude. Of

28:00.247 --> 28:01.268
course, synthetic crude. Okay. Now, you say that 
we have, in fact, reviewed every process that is

28:02.610 --> 28:19.569
publicly described for either the fissure tropes 
or the cold hydrogenation

28:02.610 --> 28:19.569
process. My tongue has become thick this 
afternoon. All right. Now, is this the... Were you

28:25.537 --> 28:27.860
referring to the TOM documents here? No, no, I'm 
referring to the Academy of Engineering. To the

28:31.004 --> 28:32.245
Academy of Engineering? Yeah. Okay. All right.

28:38.213 --> 28:40.576
Does that include going back and looking at German 
documents? That's out of curiosity. No, because

28:43.359 --> 28:52.150
we felt that the processes now have proceeded 
somewhat beyond the German technology. Now...

28:57.076 --> 29:00.879
Is there any way to find out where all the reports 
were distributed by Major Green? Do you have any

29:00.899 --> 29:01.800
idea? I remember Major Green. He evidently 
distributed. Was he with the Department of

29:07.185 --> 29:08.626
Commerce? Yes.

29:11.769 --> 29:16.893
No, I have no idea, Bob, how you could find that out. 
Unless it's in the records of the Department of

29:16.933 --> 29:20.556
Commerce someplace. Well, I can check with them. 
And then I somehow or another have come up with five

29:22.418 --> 29:26.982
indexes, which we've spoken of before. going to 1 
to 119, then 119 went to 450, and then a last index,

29:27.383 --> 29:37.460
which goes on to 305. And you didn't have anything 
to do with putting these indexes together? No. OK.

29:43.190 --> 29:45.995
Then you can't answer my questions on how they 
counted documents. I'm trying to arrive at a total

29:46.676 --> 29:50.202
figure of the number of documents brought into 
this country, see? And they seem to be scattered

29:52.097 --> 29:57.183
all over the country, and I can't... I'm sure 
you're right. You know, I can't seem to find... For

29:58.124 --> 30:03.430
example, there are documents at 
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.

30:07.335 --> 30:14.063
Were those documents I had on coal hydrogenation, 
were they from Wright-Patterson?

30:19.308 --> 30:23.073
No, this is a central air documents office. And 
that was...

30:24.575 --> 30:35.350
And I don't know what the Air Force did over there. 
I've got a few of the things they did, as you see

30:35.410 --> 30:46.324
here, but I have no idea how much work they did.

30:46.344 --> 30:47.526
Well, I...
