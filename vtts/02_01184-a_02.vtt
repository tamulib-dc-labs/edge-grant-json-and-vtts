00:03.338 --> 00:13.815
And he was telling that the university 
administration thinks that McDonald either lies

00:03.338 --> 00:13.815
to them or is incompetent to give them a straight 
answer about how much something is going to cost.

00:13.835 --> 00:14.636
So continue, Tim. So in the early days of the 
300-inch project, where Pete Flan was president

00:14.837 --> 00:26.275
and Harlan was pushing it very hard,

00:27.200 --> 00:39.044
In my opinion, and I've never had Pete Flan say this 
one way or another, or Jerry Falcon say it, who had

00:27.200 --> 00:39.044
become Flan's vice president for research and 
then later executive vice president provost. In

00:40.607 --> 00:45.276
my opinion, they made us jump through so many hoops 
They wanted outside reviews on a number of

00:45.965 --> 00:50.631
occasions. They were extraordinarily cautious 
in believing the information we sent up to them.

00:56.619 --> 01:05.070
And then, in my opinion, that delayed the project 
so long that the oil crunch in Texas happened and

00:56.619 --> 01:05.070
killed it. And that... I've said to other people 
that Without Harlan Smith, there would never ever

01:10.653 --> 01:14.940
have been a 300-inch project. With Harlan Smith, 
it was impossible to accomplish a 300-inch

01:15.380 --> 01:27.279
telescope project because the relations between 
him and the administration were such that it took

01:15.380 --> 01:27.279
too damn long to develop it. We almost had the same 
problem with the SST. We began involvement in the

01:30.724 --> 01:33.929
SST in 1985. We started talking with Penn State. In 
1987, we entered into an agreement with them. But

01:43.409 --> 01:59.351
as late as 1992, the UT administration, with a new 
president, same vice president for research,

01:43.409 --> 01:59.351
were having difficulty believing anything we 
told them. And we almost lost the SST even after

01:59.371 --> 02:05.500
Harlan because of that history that had been built 
up. They, I think quite literally, they simply did

02:05.969 --> 02:08.773
not trust him. They respected his incredible 
entrepreneurial ability and they respected his

02:08.833 --> 02:17.345
ability to communicate with the public. They 
respected his ability to raise money and to

02:17.866 --> 02:25.436
convince people of the rightness of the programs 
he was pursuing. But I literally believe they did

02:25.917 --> 02:30.964
not trust him.

02:31.214 --> 02:33.997
My wife and I lived most of the last 10 years up in New 
England. And frankly, what anybody knows about

02:34.518 --> 02:48.635
the University of Texas, not just from Stardate, 
but from McDonald Observatory, that's what the

02:34.518 --> 02:48.635
University of Texas is known for in that part of the 
country and in the Midwest, too, where all my

02:34.518 --> 02:48.635
ancestors are. Do you think the administration at 
UT appreciates that?

02:57.286 --> 02:59.149
Well, the administration at UT just changed. 
We're now on about the fifth president since I've

03:00.571 --> 03:04.297
been there. They come and they go. The new 
president, I can't say if he does or not, but I can

03:05.559 --> 03:21.083
tell you this, that I'm optimistic because at the 
first Board of Visitors meeting that we had in

03:05.559 --> 03:21.083
February, at which the new president took over in 
January, Robert Berdahl, who came from the

03:05.559 --> 03:21.083
University of Illinois, He stood up in front of it 
and he said, long before I ever knew that I would

03:21.788 --> 03:34.764
show up here at the University of Texas as 
president, I had enjoyed listening on the radio in

03:21.788 --> 03:34.764
Illinois to Stardate. And he said, I'm really 
appreciative of what the observatory does in that

03:36.166 --> 03:41.493
regard. So he obviously had started out on the 
right foot. The previous president, Bill

03:48.670 --> 03:53.118
Cunningham was very strongly supportive of us all 
during his term. And without him, the

03:53.979 --> 03:57.586
spectroscopic survey telescope would have died. 
The president before that was Pete Flan. And one of

04:00.210 --> 04:05.159
the first things he said, I can remember driving 
across town and hearing it on my radio in my car. He

04:05.259 --> 04:08.284
was giving a halftime talk at a football game. They 
were interviewing him at halftime, not a talk. He

04:12.432 --> 04:13.193
was being interviewed. And they asked that 
question, what are the preeminent programs at UT

04:13.645 --> 04:18.269
Austin now that you've just taken over as 
president? And the first one out of his mouth was

04:18.549 --> 04:29.238
the McDonald Observatory and the Department of 
Astronomy program is preeminent as a jewel in our

04:18.549 --> 04:29.238
crown, or some words to that effect. So I think the 
presidents have had an appreciation for the

04:29.258 --> 04:35.884
excellence of the program in astronomy at Texas. I 
think as money gets tighter and tighter, they

04:36.384 --> 04:42.910
are...

04:43.396 --> 04:49.303
There's a little bit of the climate, what have you 
done for us lately type of attitude, which they

04:43.396 --> 04:49.303
have to take. They have to decide what's strong 
today, not what was strong 10 or 20 years ago.

04:53.308 --> 04:54.209
What's strong today? And how is that going to help 
this university? So we have to continually read.

04:58.715 --> 05:01.979
50 years ago, Harvard was the preeminent 
astronomy department. But them days is gone

05:02.019 --> 05:05.303
forever.
