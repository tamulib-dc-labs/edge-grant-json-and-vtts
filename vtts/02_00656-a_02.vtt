00:11.894 --> 00:17.762
California at San Diego a good idea for Scripps 
Institution?

00:17.782 --> 00:20.926
I guess my opinion about that has had a lot of ups and 
downs. I think in the long run, yes. It was, well,

00:22.868 --> 00:27.775
perhaps one shouldn't say good or bad. It was sort 
of inevitable. The Scripps Institution was part

00:29.296 --> 00:40.551
of the University of California, and as long as it 
is to remain a part of the university, it would have

00:29.296 --> 00:40.551
been silly, I think, to consider establishing a 
part of the university here in San Diego and not

00:42.421 --> 00:48.050
having it be tightly coordinated with Scripps. As 
it turned out, I think that the existence of

00:48.070 --> 00:57.585
Scripps made it possible for us to build a very 
strong science faculty quite rapidly. The other

00:57.605 --> 01:01.071
parts of the University of California, the new 
campuses of that same era, have not achieved

01:02.570 --> 01:09.539
anything like the scientific

01:02.570 --> 01:09.539
eminence that the San Diego campus has. We're 
right up there pushing along with Berkeley and Los

01:09.900 --> 01:14.366
Angeles, in spite of the fact that we're only about 
a third as big. And I think in large measure this was

01:15.007 --> 01:28.645
due to Revell as an individual, but also due to the 
kind of high grade science community that we had

01:15.007 --> 01:28.645
here in the specialized realm of the ocean. And a 
number of well-recognized people like Eckhart

01:28.895 --> 01:35.644
obviously made it easier to recruit good 
physicists to come. They thought, you know, it was

01:37.767 --> 01:44.216
no sin to go to San Diego to work with Carl Eckhart 
and survive. And so I think that was a big help. As

01:48.281 --> 01:54.970
director and then, well, primarily as director at 
Scripps Institution of Motionography, and your

01:55.270 --> 02:08.607
responsibility in terms of recruiting students 
and recruiting faculty members, did you feel as if

01:55.270 --> 02:08.607
the prestige of the institution allowed you to 
have sort of a choice of the upper echelon of

01:55.270 --> 02:08.607
science and students? I think in the case of 
students,

02:09.448 --> 02:18.139
for a very long time, Scripps Institution was the 
place. If you wanted to do graduate work in

02:18.900 --> 02:21.683
oceanography, there was no question that it was 
the outstanding place to go. As the world has

02:28.160 --> 02:45.124
developed, other places have grown too, and I 
think that the other two places that really

02:28.160 --> 02:45.124
compete strongly with us now are the MIT Woods Hole 
Complex and the Columbia University. Those are

02:45.144 --> 02:52.294
the other two that we battle with occasionally 
these days for the best of the incoming students.

02:54.097 --> 03:10.097
In terms of recruiting staff, that's again a

02:54.097 --> 03:10.097
kind of

02:54.097 --> 03:10.097
a place in which we do not have too much trouble.

03:12.280 --> 03:19.429
Again, we do indeed compete primarily with MIT and 
Columbia. particularly the MIT group in geology,

03:19.882 --> 03:29.834
geophysics, geophysics side of the world

03:19.882 --> 03:29.834
particularly. They provided some fairly 
formidable competition. You were asking about

03:33.599 --> 03:42.730
whether the development of the university or the 
full-scale campus here was something that I

03:33.599 --> 03:42.730
thought was good or bad. It had a very interesting 
effect on the Scripps Institution in this period

03:43.510 --> 03:48.977
in which I had to sit in the director's seat, 
because that was a period of some really deep

03:49.514 --> 03:59.550
soul-searching on the part of a lot of people in the 
Scripps Institution. As the new people arrived in

03:59.570 --> 04:14.573
science, there was a very strong sort of 
centrifugal effect that all of a sudden here were

03:59.570 --> 04:14.573
eminent chemists, eminent physicists, and so 
forth. And if you looked around, you could see the

04:14.693 --> 04:17.918
physicists and the chemists in the institution 
beginning to think less about the ocean and about

04:18.961 --> 04:32.742
working together to solve the ocean's problems 
than about what kind of interaction they were

04:18.961 --> 04:32.742
having with the physicists or with the chemists, 
the people in their own disciplines. Because

04:34.445 --> 04:38.150
we've been living in a kind of vacuum with regard to 
that for many years. And so there was a strong

04:38.210 --> 04:41.575
centrifugal effect. And I felt the main thing that 
I really had to work at while I was director was the

04:49.184 --> 04:53.890
business of just keeping the institutions from 
flying apart. Gradually this wore off and we went

04:54.471 --> 05:18.803
through a completely different stage some 
several years later in which the problems of

04:54.471 --> 05:18.803
general education and things like this, people 
who had had the luxury in earlier times of being

04:54.471 --> 05:18.803
able to specialize in not have to interact with too 
big a group, and all that sort of thing. These

05:23.354 --> 05:31.003
problems began to overwhelm people, and there was 
a great rush back toward the Scripps Institution

05:23.354 --> 05:31.003
in the late 60s. In fact, there were people on the 
upper campus, as we call it, the general campus,

05:31.063 --> 05:39.492
who wanted to join the rush. And there was a 
department, a whole department, the earth

05:40.033 --> 05:47.001
sciences department, which had been built within 
the first college up on the UCSD general campus.

05:54.267 --> 06:03.600
The science department staffed about half with 
Scripps people, and the other half with new

05:54.267 --> 06:03.600
recruits from various distinguished places. And 
that department just claimed completely COVID,

06:06.224 --> 06:10.930
and all of the people dashed back to the Scripps 
Institution because their interests were with

06:11.382 --> 06:20.153
really doing oceanographic research. And I guess 
this is the place that underscores the fact that

06:20.173 --> 06:26.921
Scripps is a sort of anomalous place in the 
University of California. It's a research

06:26.941 --> 06:34.370
institution with graduate educational 
responsibilities and public service

06:26.941 --> 06:34.370
responsibilities. This is a very, there is 
another part of the University of California that

06:34.390 --> 06:41.018
is built like this. And this means that we really 
are forever, every time there's a change in

06:41.555 --> 07:10.819
administration, a new chancellor on this campus 
or a new president of a statewide organization, we

06:41.555 --> 07:10.819
spend some fair amount of time having to go through 
indoctrination kinds of things to remind these

06:41.555 --> 07:10.819
people that this is, that the Scripps Institution 
part is not your conventional, it's neither a

06:41.555 --> 07:10.819
conventional university research institute, 
nor is it a conventional university department.

07:11.390 --> 07:13.533
and it sort of sits in between these. It's far more a 
research organization and, however, it's also a

07:13.553 --> 07:20.082
public service organization. And the University 
of California, in the basic documentation that

07:20.102 --> 07:35.963
talks about what is the mission and the goal and so 
on, and what kinds of contributions do they expect

07:20.102 --> 07:35.963
faculty members to make, The three things that are 
brought forward are teaching, research, and

07:37.563 --> 07:45.670
public service. This third item is much more of a 
factor, I think, in a state university than in a

07:45.691 --> 07:58.582
place like Harvard, and really dates back to the 
days of the agricultural impact and all that sort

07:45.691 --> 07:58.582
of thing. But Scripps Institution has much more of 
the flavor of this public service plan than other

07:58.602 --> 08:06.810
parts of the university. and, in fact, is in major 
part, as far as university support, is funded out

08:07.297 --> 08:31.465
of the same budget as the budget that supports much 
of the agricultural research and so forth, the

08:07.297 --> 08:31.465
organized research budget, so-called, of the 
university as opposed to the

08:07.297 --> 08:31.465
instruction budget. When you become chairman of 
the Oceanography Department, Does that really

08:34.111 --> 08:38.075
change your role at all in Scripps Institution? 
Yeah, yeah. Well, I was chairman of the

08:40.738 --> 08:46.724
Oceanography Department back in 1963 or 4. I gave, 
I passed that along to somebody else when I went

08:47.545 --> 08:55.954
back to being director of Scripps again.

08:55.974 --> 09:02.481
In the interim between, in the late 60s, that 
department was reorganized, combined with the

09:03.220 --> 09:25.263
marine biology curriculum that we'd had, and this 
previously existing earth sciences department,

09:03.220 --> 09:25.263
and we established a thing that we decided we would 
call the Graduate Department of the Scripps

09:03.220 --> 09:25.263
Institution of Oceanography, which essentially 
is an organizational entity that looks out for the

09:03.220 --> 09:25.263
students in a sort of formalistic way. The 
students, since these are all graduate students

09:25.884 --> 09:29.768
and nearly all PhD type, the students have to 
become involved in research. And that

09:33.434 --> 09:41.927
involvement has to work through the research 
administering subdivisions of the institution.

09:41.947 --> 09:46.795
The laboratories like the Marine Physical 
Laboratory, the research divisions, that sort of

09:41.947 --> 09:46.795
thing. But what we had found out in the early 60s was 
that if we didn't have somebody who was charged

09:46.815 --> 09:59.113
with seeing that the students in fact had some 
financial support, and that they, in fact, moved

09:59.600 --> 10:05.851
fruitfully toward finishing their degrees as 
opposed to getting research done. Those are two

10:06.672 --> 10:08.035
rather different things. That we would have 
students who were around for eight or ten years,

10:08.996 --> 10:24.223
and as oceanography became more widely known in 
the 60s, the number of applicants went up, and it

10:08.996 --> 10:24.223
became clear that, you know, there was no way you 
could take in numbers of people who were applying

10:24.406 --> 10:30.133
and expect them all to stay around for six or eight 
years. In fact, there was no reason for them to stay

10:30.153 --> 10:35.019
around that long. So we established this 
departmental structure, which then sees that

10:35.039 --> 10:45.132
students take their qualifying examinations at 
reasonable times and

10:46.478 --> 10:49.463
the committees are properly appointed and things 
of that sort. And essentially I took over the

10:49.483 --> 11:00.740
responsibility of the chairmanship of that 
department just this last January, so I'm doing

10:49.483 --> 11:00.740
essentially a second tour as department 
chairman. It does change your role because it

11:00.840 --> 11:13.380
means that, or it adds to your role I suppose, 
because I didn't drop any responsibilities when I

11:00.840 --> 11:13.380
took on this one, in that you have to

11:16.027 --> 11:27.902
think about the role of the institution in a 
different way, in terms of what kind of a

11:16.027 --> 11:27.902
contribution it's making specifically to the 
students, as opposed to what kind of contribution

11:16.027 --> 11:27.902
it's making to Oceania. Now, when your scientific 
liaison officer for Western Europe, what does

11:27.922 --> 11:34.050
that mean? That was an interesting interview.

11:39.337 --> 11:41.680
The Office of Naval Research

11:44.326 --> 11:48.110
has been overall a very enlightened 
organization. It really started out right after

11:48.130 --> 11:57.722
World War II as the only really effective 
supporter of research in the United States. And

11:59.083 --> 12:02.247
that role is no longer its role anymore. The 
National Science Foundation has grown in

12:02.707 --> 12:08.494
strength and purpose and capability. But one of 
the things that the Office of Naval Research did,

12:08.474 --> 12:27.821
starting right after World War II, was it 
established an office in London whose initial

12:08.474 --> 12:27.821
goal was to help scientists on the European 
continent to get back in action after World War II.

12:27.841 --> 12:38.295
And it was pretty successful in doing this, partly 
by providing communication and liaison, finding

12:27.841 --> 12:38.295
out where people were, providing some monetary 
support. equipment and things of this kind that

12:38.461 --> 13:08.164
went on for several years and then of course the 
scientific community in europe became its own

12:38.461 --> 13:08.164
community again and but the navy decided that it 
would be useful to maintain for the benefit really

12:38.461 --> 13:08.164
of the entire u.s scientific community some kind 
of liaison with the european community so that

12:38.461 --> 13:08.164
this london office stayed in existence staffed by 
people who are scientists on leave from various

13:09.680 --> 13:17.049
universities or government laboratories, 
whatever the typical duration of tour might be.

13:17.609 --> 13:19.812
Well, we'd like them to be two years or something 
like that. In recent times, it's been difficult to

13:19.832 --> 13:23.536
get people to go for that long. When you go over 
there, the aim of the game is, in fact, to make

13:24.057 --> 13:36.531
contact with as many people as you can throughout 
Europe and in whatever your field may be. go visit

13:37.068 --> 13:43.394
them, learn about what they're doing, but also to 
help them to find out what's going on in the United

13:37.068 --> 13:43.394
States. So it's sort of a two-way street, and you 
don't go out visiting without providing

13:43.474 --> 13:50.480
something in return. Make a seminar of your own 
while you're there, or a great deal of helping

13:51.401 --> 14:05.353
people to be in touch with particularly the sort of 
gray literature that most of the scientists in

13:51.401 --> 14:05.353
Europe are just as good as we are about reading and 
reading publications, but they don't always have

14:05.738 --> 14:23.458
access to reports that are done within ONR 
contracts or NASA contracts or something like

14:05.738 --> 14:23.458
that, which sometimes have very useful 
information in them, but which are not always

14:05.738 --> 14:23.458
easily accessible to people in the European 
community. And so one of the ways that you can help

14:23.478 --> 14:33.990
people over there is to put them in touch with that 
sort of thing, with other people in the United

14:23.478 --> 14:33.990
States who are working on things that seem to be 
similar to theirs. And I went over there in the

14:35.320 --> 14:42.777
summer of 74 and came back in the fall of 75. In my 
case it was particularly nice because it was a

14:42.797 --> 14:52.198
chance to expand a little bit on my areas of 
interest. I was the only person on the staff for

14:52.617 --> 15:18.878
most of that grade, either in acoustics or in 
oceanography, which meant that I could go around

14:52.617 --> 15:18.878
and see what was going on in acoustics and 
diagnosis in hospitals and things like this, or go

14:52.617 --> 15:18.878
out and see what was going on in fisheries research 
and things that I have a marginal interest in but

14:52.617 --> 15:18.878
don't always have much time to keep track of when 
I'm involved here. The Conrad Award for

15:20.174 --> 15:24.840
Contribution to the Navy Science Program in 74. 
For what was that given? Good behavior. That's an

15:29.826 --> 15:48.088
award that is handed out by the Navy to people who 
played a role, not necessarily as individual

15:29.826 --> 15:48.088
research people, but in management was not really 
quite the right word either. Pulling together,

15:52.370 --> 16:00.682
stimulating, seeing that the research goes 
forward in a fruitful way, in a way that's fruitful

15:52.370 --> 16:00.682
to the Navy. And it's an award that over the years 
has been given to directors of Navy laboratories

16:00.842 --> 16:14.903
on occasion, directors of research groups, an 
occasional admiral during there who's run a major

16:00.842 --> 16:14.903
program or made major contributions to research 
activity. his vibratory and physical vibratory

16:17.566 --> 16:31.081
had been successful enough within the, oh, in 
honor of context, over the years that eventually

16:17.566 --> 16:31.081
it got to be enough, but I decided to give him that. 
Oh, what about the award from the Franklin

16:31.101 --> 16:34.725
Institute in 1965? That was a different kind of 
thing. It was really related to Flip,

16:36.687 --> 16:43.995
which is a vehicle that I had. bringing

16:46.405 --> 16:53.296
into reality. It was recognition for, well, it's 
like a lot of other medals. It's hard in science

16:57.963 --> 17:06.035
these days to give a medal to a person, because in 
general, you don't do anything alone. And in fact,

17:06.055 --> 17:14.168
in this particular instance, I guess the main 
thing I can say is that I raised the money, and did

17:06.055 --> 17:14.168
some of the design calculations, and I guess I 
wasn't the only doer by any means, but I suppose I

17:16.308 --> 17:22.820
was the leader in getting it done. He worked in the 
laboratory. That was a craft that was a lot of fun to

17:24.243 --> 17:40.172
do and has been an important tool for carrying

17:24.243 --> 17:40.172
out quite a wide range of research things and it 
grew out of a Navy program which

17:43.409 --> 18:10.632
was a part and you could see that there was a role 
that our laboratory could play and we sort of

17:43.409 --> 18:10.632
visualized this craft

17:43.409 --> 18:10.632
to take out to sea and well I mentioned the fact that 
we used to go to sea in submarines to hold

17:43.409 --> 18:10.632
hydrophones nice and still well once we got a flip 
we stopped going to sea in submarines because we

17:43.409 --> 18:10.632
could hang the hydrophones nice and still in the 
water and there wouldn't be about half a dozen of us

18:11.405 --> 18:23.436
out there scientists and even half a dozen crewmen 
instead of half a dozen scientists and 80 to 100

18:11.405 --> 18:23.436
crewmen, which you generally have in an ordinary 
military submarine. So it was really a pretty good

18:23.456 --> 18:26.879
sort of thing. What exactly was the elevation? 
Well, it was, the idea was to provide a platform

18:30.122 --> 18:41.192
which would sit stably in the ocean and We were 
initially studying a thing that's kind of like the

18:42.083 --> 18:51.399
twinkling of stars, namely the fluctuations in 
apparent direction of a variety of sound as it's

18:42.083 --> 18:51.399
transmitted through the water. And so what we 
wanted was a place where we could mount

18:51.880 --> 19:00.655
hydrophones down well within the water column, in 
this case down inside 300 feet, which is as far as

18:51.880 --> 19:00.655
the bottom of the cliff. And then one could go off in 
the distance and hang a sound source down from a

19:00.675 --> 19:04.902
ship And you could sight from up at the top out in the 
air, you could sight off to where the sound source

19:05.303 --> 19:10.228
was. At the same time you could determine the 
direction of the arrival of the sound and how that

19:10.769 --> 19:19.417
direction fluctuated back and forth because of 
the smaller temperature differences within the

19:10.769 --> 19:19.417
ocean. And so it gave us this kind of a rigid 
structure and as with other things we've done, the

19:19.437 --> 19:30.889
idea was to see if we could put something together 
that would solve one problem but would be flexible

19:31.426 --> 19:40.543
enough that it could solve a bunch of other 
problems later on that we only vaguely have a sense

19:31.426 --> 19:40.543
of. And in fact, it's been pretty successful in 
that regard. It's a good thing for hanging things

19:42.767 --> 19:47.577
down quietly.

19:47.677 --> 19:51.544
Now, it's been suggested at least that Dr. The 60s 
were in effect, particularly the middle to late

19:53.414 --> 20:03.163
60s, were sort of an age of invention which brought 
together all kinds of techniques to sending

19:53.414 --> 20:03.163
oceanographers out to sea. This may be over, that 
oceanography may now revert to having more and

20:03.884 --> 20:15.354
more work done in the lab and a systematic work with 
the data already produced. Would you agree with

20:15.414 --> 20:21.700
this?

20:22.051 --> 20:25.997
To some extent this has to be true. Partly because 
communication has become so much better and we've

20:26.017 --> 20:42.364
developed or are in the process of developing ways 
of looking at some aspects of the ocean anyway.

20:42.384 --> 20:48.514
Using things like satellites for example where it 
really

20:48.967 --> 20:51.169
you might just as well be sitting in your lab as any 
place else. It doesn't mean you're going to get to

20:51.289 --> 20:53.992
be on a ship if you're going to use satellite data. 
It's going to come pouring down out of the sky by

20:54.152 --> 20:59.837
whatever radio link it uses. And you're going to 
sit at home near your computer and try to

20:59.857 --> 21:10.847
understand what that information means. I think, 
on the other hand, there is much, in some ways,

21:10.867 --> 21:18.214
there is less working

21:18.650 --> 21:32.730
in the data manipulation business after an 
operation is over. It used to be that you'd go out

21:32.750 --> 21:46.750
and make some measurements and you had to come home 
and work those over very, very heavily before you

21:32.750 --> 21:46.750
could write a paper. ability to take computers to 
sea with us, and to take more sophisticated

21:47.101 --> 22:06.381
instruments for doing chemical analyses, and 
whatever, also, has meant that the turnaround

21:47.101 --> 22:06.381
time for a problem of a given level of complexity is 
going to be a lot shorter. So you have these two

22:06.401 --> 22:14.029
things kind of working against one another when 
you try to guess what the oceanographer of the

22:06.401 --> 22:14.029
future is going to do as far as going to sea. On the 
one hand, he has the capability to go to sea and get

22:17.307 --> 22:22.053
his data in shape to draw some conclusions a lot 
faster than he could before. So his turnaround

22:22.073 --> 22:26.919
time to get ready to go back out to sea and find 
something else has increased. In fact, almost the

22:27.640 --> 22:40.196
limiting factor there is the publication time or 
something of this kind, because the granting

22:27.640 --> 22:40.196
agencies like to see something in hard print 
before they like to keep on funding you to go on off

22:27.640 --> 22:40.196
for the next trip. And yet the early part of the data 
analysis can go very, very fast. So if there's that

22:46.197 --> 22:59.614
working against the fact that there are other 
buoys, satellites, and things of this kind that

22:46.197 --> 22:59.614
make it possible to do perfectly good 
oceanography without ever running out of our ship

22:46.197 --> 22:59.614
at all. Okay. What particular problems in the 
immediate future do you see oceanography

23:00.274 --> 23:04.880
addressing itself to? I don't know.

23:12.209 --> 23:13.791
There's two kinds of problems.

23:16.387 --> 23:19.230
scientific problems. And here I guess

23:19.250 --> 23:44.352
the air-sea interaction problem is a major one 
that is attracting a lot of attention and is going

23:19.250 --> 23:44.352
to require a lot more attention before it really is 
solved.

23:44.372 --> 23:44.993
Biological questions still remain kind of 
elusive in terms of what we can do about them.

23:55.920 --> 24:05.260
Geology, geophysics part has benefited greatly 
from improved

23:55.920 --> 24:05.260
instrumentation, ability to make measurements 
that are relevant. in quite a variety of ways. And

24:07.669 --> 24:22.442
the geologists who 10 or 15 years ago played just 
qualitative games and looked at rocks and things

24:07.669 --> 24:22.442
like this now know as much geophysics as 
geophysicists do in many instances. And it's hard

24:22.902 --> 24:25.885
to draw the line. And they've learned to work with 
sophisticated instrumentation and draw

24:25.905 --> 24:35.854
conclusions from this in conjunction with 
whatever things you do with actual samples. the

24:35.834 --> 25:00.627
biologists haven't gotten quite around to this 
place yet partly because it's not as easy to solve

24:35.834 --> 25:00.627
their problems with the instrumentation side of 
the game because at least you know where the sea

24:35.834 --> 25:00.627
floor is and it's likely to stay there it's only 
going to move a few centimeters per year or

24:35.834 --> 25:00.627
something of this kind whereas the biological 
situation will change very rapidly it changes

25:03.593 --> 25:05.355
and rapidly in both space and time. The question of 
patchiness of distribution of animals in the sea,

25:05.796 --> 25:19.755
plants and animals, why this occurs, what kinds of 
scales, and how much of this is behavioral, how

25:05.796 --> 25:19.755
much of it is hydrodynamic, things of this kind. 
These are all the questions

25:19.775 --> 25:28.167
that I think remain to be answered.

25:30.847 --> 25:41.342
There is a question in sort of sociological terms, 
I suppose, as to

25:30.847 --> 25:41.342
who wants to know about the ocean anyway, sort of, 
you know?

25:45.728 --> 25:52.517
The biological situation often is justified in 
people's minds by fisheries-type activities.

26:00.633 --> 26:04.098
Really, and that's a perfectly good 
justification in its own way. The question of what

26:04.920 --> 26:17.701
level of research activity you can justify, 
however, is a different

26:04.920 --> 26:17.701
one. And this is why I think that some other aspects 
than the fisheries are beginning to drive the

26:22.028 --> 26:35.049
biological situation in the sense that people 
would like to know if you spill a bunch of oil out of a

26:22.028 --> 26:35.049
ship, what's that going to do to the biological 
situation in the sea? A supertanker full of oil

26:35.069 --> 26:43.622
represents as much money as an awful lot of 
fishing. And so, although the the destruction of

26:50.260 --> 26:57.153
life in the sea or something like that is 
approached on a sort of aesthetic basis almost.

26:59.117 --> 27:05.670
The question of whether people are going to exact 
retribution from oil tanker drivers who do

27:06.038 --> 27:08.742
pollute the ocean. If they are, then there has to be 
a lot more argument about marine biology involved

27:08.762 --> 27:14.510
in all that. So the tanker drivers and oil 
companies are going to claim that, in fact, you

27:14.590 --> 27:23.902
know, I haven't been in the ocean anyway.

27:26.947 --> 27:34.577
And the amounts of money that are going to be 
involved between governments trying to just

27:26.947 --> 27:34.577
maintain those... the nice values of life. You may 
all get involved in more money than you didn't

27:39.401 --> 27:43.345
think of in the fisheries business. And finally, 
where do you think your career is going to go? I

27:50.233 --> 27:53.777
don't know. I have a couple of, some research 
things that I hope I'll be able to work on.

28:06.333 --> 28:21.492
seem to me to be interesting whether

28:06.333 --> 28:21.492
I can convince other people that they're 
interesting enough to fund them. That's another

28:21.572 --> 28:25.637
kind of thing I'd like to do. So I'm very careful 
measuring the displacement of the floor of the

28:25.657 --> 28:29.061
ocean. The plate tectonics model that has come out 
of recent geology and geophysics certainly says

28:29.081 --> 28:35.749
that the pieces of the crust of the earth are 
sliding around people are beginning

28:36.303 --> 28:56.504
to be able to measure these motions directly on 
land, like on the San Andreas Fault, or in Iceland,

28:36.303 --> 28:56.504
when the spreading centers come up to the sea 
surface. And I'd like to go ahead and make some

28:56.524 --> 29:00.708
measurements of this kind on the deep sea floor, 
spreading centers. This, I think,

29:00.728 --> 29:05.213
is within the realm of technology. Also,

29:06.290 --> 29:33.934
I'm getting

29:06.290 --> 29:33.934
to

29:06.290 --> 29:33.934
a place where I probably have to think rather more 
about looking perhaps at a broader picture, and

29:06.290 --> 29:33.934
I've tried to look at a broader picture for a long 
time, but I think the question of interactions

29:06.290 --> 29:33.934
outside of the sphere of just this laboratory and 
this institution There

29:36.158 --> 29:44.077
are numerous opportunities and other kinds of 
things in that area. Perhaps that will happen.
