00:04.908 --> 00:10.918
How did our course compare with theirs?

01:15.040 --> 01:36.070
Thank

01:15.040 --> 01:36.070
you. I'm

01:37.163 --> 02:06.175
assuming that the Of

02:06.998 --> 02:28.112
all the N70s, that University of Texas score in 
January, scored higher or hit more than a year at

02:06.998 --> 02:28.112
the top than any of the others until Houston came 
in? Or was there no clear dominant team in college?

02:49.118 --> 02:54.555
Okay.

05:35.236 --> 05:49.768
...

05:35.236 --> 05:49.768
... ... ...

06:09.931 --> 06:23.970
But we would basically play against them,

06:09.931 --> 06:23.970
whatever it is, whatever side. That's it.

06:36.286 --> 06:39.330
All right. To

06:39.985 --> 07:07.697
this

06:39.985 --> 07:07.697
day, I don't. What was your, what were your rules

07:08.993 --> 07:22.690
in transit?

07:25.553 --> 07:31.060
Basically, they wanted to listen to music or 
something like that when we were roughhousing,

07:25.553 --> 07:31.060
when I was driving. We'd talk all the time, 
sometimes.

07:56.817 --> 08:05.528
Thank

07:56.817 --> 08:05.528
you.

08:31.343 --> 08:33.591
Thank you.

10:26.752 --> 10:28.881
uh... stronger alcohol
