WEBVTT

00:02.647 --> 00:07.113
They had them for so long in a department head 
status.

00:12.541 --> 00:25.159
Now, in those early days, did President Rutter or 
Vice President Page give you any guidelines, any

00:12.541 --> 00:25.159
boundaries? None. None.

00:38.810 --> 00:44.255
How often did you meet with the other deans and the 
president and the vice president?

00:47.418 --> 01:08.496
At that time, 59 and for a few years beyond that,

00:47.418 --> 01:08.496
there existed what was known, I think, as an 
executive committee, the executive committee.

01:10.180 --> 01:11.741
President Rutter presided. Other members were 
Vice President Page, Registrar Lloyd Heaton, who

01:14.044 --> 01:24.894
kept the minutes of that group.

01:30.919 --> 01:38.466
Each of the four deans, academic deans, plus the 
dean of students, and the vice president for

01:39.847 --> 01:42.650
business affairs. That's one, two, three, four, 
five, six, I think eight people.

01:53.203 --> 02:04.116
Well,

01:53.203 --> 02:04.116
they would meet, I believe, once a week over in the 
Koch building.

02:08.973 --> 02:22.109
And the agenda consisted of curricular matters 
and other items which pertained to the operation

02:08.973 --> 02:22.109
of the university. At times, there were

02:23.891 --> 02:32.601
some

02:37.053 --> 02:41.437
Oh, let's see how to describe this.

02:51.525 --> 02:57.951
At times there were some unexpected agenda items, 
but not frequently. And by an unexpected agenda

02:58.531 --> 03:06.098
item, I mean something that one of the deans would 
bring to the table as a as a potential problem in

03:06.213 --> 03:11.562
that area or whatever.

03:16.249 --> 03:30.212
President Rutter had,

03:16.249 --> 03:30.212
President Rutter as the presiding officer of the 
executive committee

03:37.060 --> 03:45.473
had the style of discussing an issue on the agenda, 
whatever it might be.

03:49.118 --> 04:06.004
But then, before a vote was taken on it,

03:49.118 --> 04:06.004
and after, on occasions, he had expressed his view 
on the subject He would go around the table asking

04:08.262 --> 04:14.231
each one of those present, what do you think? And 
generally, you would say in a two-sentence

04:15.793 --> 04:23.805
expression, what I think. And of course, they were 
always tailored to what the chairman thinks.

04:32.217 --> 04:35.502
I recall there was one departure to that on one 
occasion. after I'd been there a few years.

04:41.113 --> 04:47.523
And it, I think, started the group.

04:54.793 --> 04:55.274
Let's see.

04:59.740 --> 05:04.307
But that was the way that President Rutter

05:07.308 --> 05:22.127
made known to the deans

05:07.308 --> 05:22.127
what he expected

05:07.308 --> 05:22.127
in the way of change or progress or whatever. 
Incidentally, Haskell,

05:24.270 --> 05:35.644
I don't know whether this should go into the record 
or not. You want me to turn it off? Yeah. When you

05:40.653 --> 05:45.880
first got here, who were your dean colleagues? My 
closest colleague was Fred Benson in the College

05:48.083 --> 05:51.728
of Engineering.

05:54.873 --> 06:01.342
I did not know Patterson very well, dean of 
agriculture.

06:05.387 --> 06:05.968
And

06:08.497 --> 06:17.566
I knew Al Price

06:08.497 --> 06:17.566
somewhat, but not closely.

06:20.389 --> 06:24.774
Describe Benson and his personality and his 
style. Who? Fred Benson.

06:34.724 --> 06:37.727
Fred was low-key.

06:40.171 --> 06:40.892
Thorough. Took an engineer's.

06:46.559 --> 06:48.882
Made an engineer's analysis about. Issues that 
came up.

06:54.670 --> 06:58.695
A stickler for truth and honesty.

07:05.564 --> 07:06.465
Square shooter. Do you think that President 
Rudder in those early, your early years here, do

07:08.842 --> 07:20.456
you think that there were any of the deans that had 
more influence with him than the others? I've just

07:20.877 --> 07:22.939
named him Fred Benson. I think Fred and his 
straightforwardness

07:23.480 --> 07:38.038
and his business acumen and knowledge of his field 
plus the recognition that Fred had among the

07:40.246 --> 08:00.926
engineering sector in the state, commercial as 
well as collegiate,

07:40.246 --> 08:00.926
became known to Rutter, and he recognized that and 
respected it. As you were trying to learn more

08:01.967 --> 08:09.915
about A&M and your responsibilities, to whom did 
you turn for input? Who were your advisors,

08:10.705 --> 08:14.531
friends, counselors?

08:25.347 --> 08:27.430
Haskell, I can't remember that I had one. Did you 
pick up the phone and call another dean and say,

08:29.593 --> 08:34.179
I've got a problem, what do I do? I'd call Benson 
occasionally, rarely. Mm-hmm. He was the only one

08:39.173 --> 08:41.115
I would call. On

08:42.757 --> 08:58.653
maybe an occasion or two, I would call Wayne Hall, 
but not frequently. He becomes the vice president

08:58.673 --> 09:03.859
not long after Boyd Page leaves. Describe Wayne 
Hall's style of... of administrative

09:08.671 --> 09:10.754
leadership?

09:18.246 --> 09:19.929
Again, low-key.

09:28.703 --> 09:35.353
That's the best I can say of it, a low-key guy.

09:35.671 --> 09:43.582
He was strongly loyal to President Rutter, I 
think.

09:43.942 --> 09:49.269
I've learned from him that he was Dean Hall. I have 
trouble not calling him Dean Hall because when I

09:49.289 --> 09:58.962
worked for him as assistant graduate dean, but 
when I worked for Dr. Hall, I learned that he

09:59.836 --> 10:10.050
apparently is the one when Mr. Rutter was very 
unhappy about the recommendation that the name be

09:59.836 --> 10:10.050
changed to Texas State University. Mr. Rutter 
didn't like that at all. And that Hall came up with

10:12.754 --> 10:22.768
the Texas A&M, no abbreviations, the A and the M and 
the ampersand, and that he said Mr. Rutter liked

10:12.754 --> 10:22.768
that. He wanted to hold on to the A&M title. Yeah. 
With A&M not standing for anything. That's right.

10:29.520 --> 10:29.841
That's right. I'm going to. All right. Unplug 
your. Oh, I'm going to close this block. As you

10:38.097 --> 10:47.916
became the new dean, what were your immediate 
goals for arts and sciences and then your long

10:38.097 --> 10:47.916
range goals?

11:02.864 --> 11:04.005
No Haskell.

11:06.548 --> 11:08.050
I don't recall having. A set of.

11:14.298 --> 11:14.818
Goals. Either in writing or. In memory.

11:24.310 --> 11:25.611
I I wanted to. First of all, I wanted to do a a good 
job. I

11:32.733 --> 11:55.093
felt more responsible

11:32.733 --> 11:55.093
to the department heads and the faculty than I did 
to the Koch building. And you didn't have any fires

11:56.454 --> 11:59.317
that had to be put out? There were no immediate 
problems that you had to deal with. Well, quickly.

12:07.519 --> 12:08.100
There were. There

12:08.140 --> 12:19.035
were. A couple of personnel matters. That 
President Rudder was interested in in the School

12:22.800 --> 12:28.407
of Arts and Sciences.

12:31.154 --> 12:32.636
That he wanted. Changes made in. But he didn't put 
undue pressure on me. To. Make those changes.

12:49.233 --> 12:51.135
And they were made. In time. One ran its normal 
course, the other. I found an opportunity where

13:00.162 --> 13:24.362
the individual had

13:00.162 --> 13:24.362
problems with his travel reports, and it was the 
basis for requiring a change. It turned out well,

13:25.103 --> 13:29.967
and I think, please, Mr. Rutter,

13:33.136 --> 13:42.725
But

13:33.136 --> 13:42.725
I

13:33.136 --> 13:42.725
wanted to see the college grow.

13:45.628 --> 13:49.772
I wanted to see the departments get the 
recognition they deserved. One of the first

13:51.614 --> 14:03.025
things I did from the standpoint of a study made to 
help me at the budget table was to develop a

14:04.591 --> 14:31.847
statistical analysis of the budget of A&M College 
of Texas in which I showed total

14:04.591 --> 14:31.847
number of faculty by rank, salary and average 
salary by rank at each department in every college

14:04.591 --> 14:31.847
with college-wide summaries, school summaries, 
that is.

14:35.827 --> 14:50.407
I also showed secretarial

14:35.827 --> 14:50.407
support

14:35.827 --> 14:50.407
in the department head's office for the 
department head and the faculty. The number, the

14:52.090 --> 15:01.463
head count number of people in service positions 
to help the department head and the faculty. And of

15:03.706 --> 15:05.749
course, here sits ag and engineering, each with 
the

15:06.151 --> 15:32.800
support

15:06.151 --> 15:32.800
of being Agricultural and Mechanical College of 
Texas, plus each with an engineering experiment

15:06.151 --> 15:32.800
station and an extension service from which They 
could borrow and change and swap out and such.

15:42.160 --> 16:02.297
And that was, incidentally, the amount of support

15:42.160 --> 16:02.297
for the departments in the School of Arts and 
Sciences almost just dwindled into

15:42.160 --> 16:02.297
insignificance when compared to these big guns.

16:05.551 --> 16:13.901
I also did an analysis of travel funds,

16:05.551 --> 16:13.901
which was just startling.

16:16.384 --> 16:32.503
Did an analysis of

16:16.384 --> 16:32.503
semester credit hour production, how much 
teaching took place in this college by department

16:16.384 --> 16:32.503
compared to that college by department.

16:39.942 --> 17:02.322
That,

16:39.942 --> 17:02.322
when I went for my hearing with President Rutter

16:39.942 --> 17:02.322
on budget matters, and as I recall at that time the 
business manager was a chap by the name of Charles,

16:39.942 --> 17:02.322
Tom Cherry hadn't come yet. Graber or something 
like that. I believe it was G-R-A-E-B, I think.

17:09.655 --> 17:10.936
Yeah, I think so. I gave him a copy and I gave the 
president a copy and I went over it page by page and

17:12.277 --> 17:20.406
it was painful for them.

17:24.411 --> 17:28.495
And I think that helped open the door budget-wise 
for us in the

17:28.795 --> 17:34.421
School of Arts and Sciences. We didn't make 
quantum leaps by any means, but we did increase our

17:34.761 --> 17:55.883
support both salary-wise and office help, 
travel, other expenses kind of things.

17:56.993 --> 17:58.896
Gradually, but it increased.

18:05.425 --> 18:11.813
Among your department, I'm not going to ask the 
negative now, among those department heads that

18:05.425 --> 18:11.813
you inherited, who were your favorites?

18:19.644 --> 18:20.485
Hard to say. Chester Clipple in mathematics. I... 
thought was a great guy.

18:35.388 --> 18:49.309
Chester

18:35.388 --> 18:49.309
did not

18:35.388 --> 18:49.309
take kindly at the graduate level in mathematics. 
Chester did not look with great favor upon making a

18:54.537 --> 18:59.122
strong effort to improve the graduate enrollment 
in mathematics.

19:02.346 --> 19:11.837
His department was probably the most selective of 
all for graduate students. He had grown up under

19:11.857 --> 19:19.526
the tutelage of a UT

19:11.857 --> 19:19.526
mathematician.

19:22.870 --> 19:24.392
Name escapes me now. who felt that you just almost 
had to walk on water to be a candidate, to be a

19:26.397 --> 19:47.550
doctoral student in mathematics, that you really 
truly had to come up with an original, creative,

19:26.397 --> 19:47.550
new mathematical construction of some kind that 
just never existed before. Clipper was like that.

19:54.460 --> 19:56.944
Now, who headed education when you arrived? When I 
arrived, Grady Parker was head of education. It

20:02.091 --> 20:04.555
was a department and business was a department. It 
was a department. Business was a division. Oh,

20:08.141 --> 20:08.681
that's right. The division of business. No 
departments within the division.

20:16.874 --> 20:21.801
And I was amused when, in a way amused, I was amused 
at the rationale given for the dissolution

20:23.738 --> 20:40.641
of the School of Arts and Sciences into a College of 
Liberal Arts and a College of Science.

20:43.465 --> 20:51.957
President Rutter said that various consultants 
had looked at it and they felt that the span of

20:43.465 --> 20:51.957
control

20:54.940 --> 21:07.792
a good administrative word, that the span of 
control was too extensive for one dean to have so

20:54.940 --> 21:07.792
many departments, those in science and over here. 
And at the same time that took place, I'd made a swap

21:10.295 --> 21:17.081
with political, a swap with the president. I said, 
well, if we're going to do this, namely reorganize

21:17.121 --> 21:24.188
the College of the School of Arts and Sciences and 
the two colleges.

21:31.085 --> 21:37.917
I would like at least to take the Division of 
Business Administration and give it

21:31.085 --> 21:37.917
departmental status.

21:42.044 --> 21:44.168
So in the same movement, We created as many 
departments in business as we lost in science.

21:52.878 --> 21:55.723
Span of control turned out to be the same. So arts 
and sciences is divided into two parts at first.

22:03.514 --> 22:07.781
Yes, liberal arts and science. And did the 
geosciences go with science? Oceanography and

22:13.443 --> 22:15.425
Meteorology.

22:18.949 --> 22:28.641
Geosciences was comprised of oceanography and 
meteorology out of the School of Arts and

22:18.949 --> 22:28.641
Sciences. Geology from engineering. Geography 
from, was it in agriculture at that time?

22:40.374 --> 22:42.657
Geophysics.

22:44.290 --> 22:48.075
or was that Department of Geology? But 
geosciences came, I think, after science did,

22:50.319 --> 23:01.695
maybe by a year, Haskell. I'm fuzzy on that. And 
then later, education becomes a college, And

23:11.358 --> 23:13.701
business becomes a college. Business becomes a 
college first. Then education becomes a college

23:17.405 --> 23:20.208
in 69. Okay. So 10 years after you. 10 years after I 
got. All right, let's back up and lead me as much as

23:26.334 --> 23:40.470
you can, lead this discussion through the century 
study, the aspirations report, and all of that.

23:43.657 --> 23:47.141
How did, as far as you know, how did that come into 
being even? What, the central council? Why did we

23:50.985 --> 23:55.390
even have a forward look? I think it came into being 
as a consequence of the University of Texas study.

24:03.098 --> 24:05.061
Because theirs was their 75th. Theirs was their 
75th anniversary, wasn't it? Yes. That was the

24:10.507 --> 24:13.630
basis for the committee of 75. and ours was the 
Century Council, 100. Have to go up a little

24:18.753 --> 24:20.455
higher, you know.

24:26.382 --> 24:35.894
So I think that was the prime push for the

24:26.382 --> 24:35.894
Century Council study.

24:38.678 --> 24:39.499
President Rudder, called me over and said he'd 
like for me to become the chairman of the

24:40.323 --> 25:04.660
coordinating committee i think was its title i'm 
not sure he

24:40.323 --> 25:04.660
gave me the names of others he thought would be good 
members of the committee and

24:40.323 --> 25:04.660
the responsibility of that committee was to

25:08.437 --> 25:10.279
Determine agenda for meetings.

25:12.963 --> 25:23.055
Seek out and put into usable form all the data and 
information which the various committees of the

25:12.963 --> 25:23.055
Century Council. Salt. Ask for. Make it 
presentable to them.

25:32.407 --> 25:36.672
I I. I guess the word would be.

25:40.094 --> 25:54.456
I'm not sure, the first meeting of the Century 
Council, President Rutter asked me to lay out the

25:40.094 --> 25:54.456
long scope agenda, which I did. And,

25:54.516 --> 26:06.895
of course, it was that Century Council supported 
by one other not too frequently remembered

26:08.478 --> 26:19.113
activity

26:08.478 --> 26:19.113
that caused the big change in military and 
coeducation. And with reference to that second

26:19.133 --> 26:36.038
one I'm speaking of, it was a study commissioned by 
the Farmer Students Association to go to the high

26:19.133 --> 26:36.038
schools of the state and In a blindfold study, A&M 
not identified as the sponsor of the study. They

26:43.747 --> 26:53.956
asked a PR firm, I think, in Houston to design and 
execute the study for them. Barton Nelson was part

26:53.976 --> 26:57.780
of that over in rural sociology. I know. But that 
study, commissioned by the at President Rudder

27:06.342 --> 27:33.447
and the board's request, commissioned by the 
former students and paid for by them, went to the

27:06.342 --> 27:33.447
high schools of Texas asking, I think, juniors or 
juniors and seniors about their preferences for

27:06.342 --> 27:33.447
colleges, why Why do you prefer this college?

27:41.180 --> 27:44.224
I don't know whether they asked, why do you dislike 
this college or not? But nonetheless, A&M came out

27:44.305 --> 27:51.815
weakly, weak, weak, weak. Such phrases as Cal 
College, no girls,

27:51.835 --> 28:04.092
and such as that. I think that study, although it 
hasn't been given the recognition publicly that

28:05.455 --> 28:28.448
it deserves, I think that had as much influence on 
the dissolution of all military and the

28:05.455 --> 28:28.448
development of a coeducational program as 
anything else. There's one other... name

28:32.017 --> 28:42.287
associated with coeducation especially that I 
have not heard at all during any of the discussions

28:32.017 --> 28:42.287
over the years. And that's the name of a woman by the 
name of Mary Ann Parker. Do you know that name? Mary

28:52.557 --> 28:58.582
Ann Parker was the wife of

28:52.557 --> 28:58.582
George Parker. What was his name? I knew them both.

29:06.155 --> 29:08.278
Mary Ann, I think, was a UT grad. Her

29:08.298 --> 29:28.949
parents, her family, I think, Parker Lumber and 
Parker Esten Hardware, that Parker, affluent,

29:08.298 --> 29:28.949
well-to-do, top of the list, O'Brien 
citizenship.

29:31.533 --> 29:32.955
Mary Ann Parker for several months raised all 
kinds of stew about the admission of women to Texas

29:35.365 --> 29:46.080
A&M University. She was in President Rutter's 
hair and he,

29:47.763 --> 29:59.119
he was not happy with her pushing. She wanted women 
admitted. Oh Lord, yes. She and Bill Moore.

30:08.693 --> 30:24.393
I don't know what prompted Mary Ann to become so 
heavily involved, except that it might have been

30:08.693 --> 30:24.393
just it was something that she thought should 
happen. But she threatened lawsuits.

30:32.015 --> 30:38.322
and in fact may have initiated a lawsuit for a while 
back in the old Brown Eagle. There's quite a few

30:39.883 --> 30:47.352
stories about Mary Ann Parker and her quest for the 
admission of women. I never see her name

30:48.132 --> 30:53.218
identified with that movement, but it was strong.

30:57.723 --> 30:58.984
Now, I have heard a legend that when Mr. Rutter got 
our committee's first set of recommendations,

30:59.842 --> 31:11.498
recommending women, volunteer corps, that he 
called the deans in and fussed at them. And did

31:12.820 --> 31:13.361
what? And fussed at them, chewed them out. Why 
didn't you all watch on the... Why don't you

31:15.323 --> 31:18.908
control it better? There you go. Is that correct, 
as you recall? I do not specifically recall such a

31:24.756 --> 31:27.560
meeting. It could have happened. I... There are a 
lot of things I don't recall, Haskell. Another

31:33.693 --> 31:46.614
part of the myth is that Benson, the way I heard it, 
Benson kind of said, well, Earl, if you didn't want

31:33.693 --> 31:46.614
their recommendations, you sure as hell 
shouldn't have asked for them. That sounds like

31:46.694 --> 31:50.841
Benson.

31:52.965 --> 31:55.549
Did you deans have any... Did you all have any 
guesstimate of what the Century Study was going to

31:57.014 --> 32:02.099
recommend? Were you all surprised?

32:15.453 --> 32:18.596
Well, not really. It seemed to me to be just such an 
essential It's going somewhere along the line.

32:28.034 --> 32:29.295
It's going to take place. Why not now? After all of 
this support for it and strong voices for it. And of

32:36.045 --> 32:39.410
course there was that minority of the old diehards 
who. Who resented it deeply? But. In the final

32:44.818 --> 32:46.200
analysis. Did not submit a minority report. Did 
any body try to twist your arm? No. No. At one time,

32:57.203 --> 33:04.534
J. Harold Dunn was the chairman of the Century 
Council. At one time, during a luncheon, I sat next

33:06.217 --> 33:18.656
to Harold, and he asked me, he said, Dean Hubert, he 
didn't say, do you think we ought to admit women? He

33:18.676 --> 33:22.101
said, how do you think we should start the 
admission of women?

33:25.574 --> 33:29.980
I said, well, Mr. Dunn, there are two ways in my 
mind. The first is just use the same admission

33:30.000 --> 33:39.632
standards, but open it up.

33:42.736 --> 33:44.699
If you're qualified, come on. The second would be a 
more gradual conservative approach, and that

33:48.372 --> 34:13.705
would be to open it up first for the first two to four 
years to transfer girls, students from junior

33:48.372 --> 34:13.705
colleges or from any other college who have at 
least 60 hours of college credit come to A&M for

33:48.372 --> 34:13.705
your degree and your upper division work.

34:16.756 --> 34:22.726
And that was a move which I thought had some merit 
from the very beginning of this study. I never did

34:23.387 --> 34:28.074
expound it, but I felt that it had some merit. But I 
did say that to Harold Dunn. He was the only one who

34:32.000 --> 34:39.372
asked me my opinion about the... about the 
coeducational thing. He was certainly for it, no

34:43.865 --> 34:47.388
question about that. Now, I have the impression 
that one of the other unsung heroes in all those

34:48.069 --> 34:55.316
changes was Bill Moore. Please add any 
information or perception you have of Bill

34:56.477 --> 35:03.064
Moore's interests and his role. Well, I just, my 
knowledge of Bill's role is sideline knowledge.

35:10.722 --> 35:12.304
not mainstream knowledge. But I do know that Bill,

35:14.287 --> 35:39.463
and I've got to add, along with Mary Ann Parker,

35:14.287 --> 35:39.463
was just so strong in expressing their views on the 
need for A&M to open up as a coeducational school.

35:39.983 --> 35:44.410
Bill Bill approached it from the standpoint of 
the. Of the legitimate use of state resources. You

35:51.783 --> 35:54.407
can't deny them on the basis of. This 
discriminating on sex.

36:01.299 --> 36:02.020
And. That was essentially Mary Ann Parker's view 
also.

36:09.565 --> 36:23.726
But Bill's main role, I think, was just as you 
indicated, some other individual put his arm

36:09.565 --> 36:23.726
around Earl and say, Earl, it's got to happen, old 
boy. I can't keep the lid on the Senate anymore. And

36:29.976 --> 36:34.763
of course, Bill was in such a strong position as 
chairman of the Senate Finance Committee

36:38.354 --> 36:46.425
that

36:38.354 --> 36:46.425
he had to be listened to. How Earl responded to 
that, I don't have the slightest idea. What do you

36:52.233 --> 36:56.579
remember about any discussion or attitudes about 
race? I don't remember much opposition to

36:57.461 --> 37:00.284
integration. I don't think there was any. I don't 
recall it if there was. When were you aware that

37:07.801 --> 37:14.587
those first black students were going to enroll in 
summer school that year? I didn't know that they

37:15.328 --> 37:18.251
were going to. I certainly wasn't. Huh? I wasn't. I 
wasn't aware, no. I understand that Mr. Rutter

37:23.756 --> 37:37.268
called the Pentagon and

37:23.756 --> 37:37.268
said when they send some regular Army enlisted 
men, as they normally did to finish a degree at A&M,

37:37.703 --> 37:40.105
to include some black students that summer. And 
then he called Mr. Heaton in, I understand, and

37:41.607 --> 37:47.913
said, Lloyd, you check their prerequisites. You 
check their transcript and be sure they're in the

37:48.073 --> 37:57.101
right section taking the right courses. But I and 
my colleagues, we weren't aware that there were

37:58.883 --> 38:07.491
going to be any black students in history courses 
until the appropriate instructors got a call from

38:08.078 --> 38:11.902
Mr. Eaton's office. I wasn't aware of it, which is, 
I think, good.

38:25.737 --> 38:27.659
Will you interview Charles McCandless? Yes, sir. 
I already have. Did Charles tell you the story of

38:31.163 --> 38:35.408
the Pinkerton detective? He mentioned it, but 
Please, you tell it. Charles was closer to it than

38:41.668 --> 39:06.300
I, but

38:41.668 --> 39:06.300
during the 60s, when the SDS was on campus and 
organizing the society chapter,

38:41.668 --> 39:06.300
they began to make noises which, of course, 
President Rutter detested.

39:09.419 --> 39:20.352
And

39:09.419 --> 39:20.352
he tried to do everything he could to put 
roadblocks in their way.

39:24.197 --> 39:33.448
Charles McCandless was the associate dean in 
liberal arts for student relations programs. He

39:35.490 --> 39:38.734
came to me one day and said, Dean Hubert, We have a 
new student who is just not going to class.

39:47.789 --> 39:57.823
All he's done practically is register, maybe 
showing up in class once or twice, but he's not

39:47.789 --> 39:57.823
going to school at all. What's his name? He gave me 
his name. I says, call him in and give him a warning

40:01.689 --> 40:09.700
and bust him out of here if he can't go to school.

40:14.033 --> 40:15.915
I don't remember whether Charles. Called him in 
and gave him the warning. Or whether Charles first

40:20.220 --> 40:23.383
he must have done that. Because a few days later, 
Charles got a call from the Coke building.

40:33.234 --> 40:37.459
That that guy you're concerned about not going to 
class. Don't worry about him. He's on a special

40:41.163 --> 40:43.365
scholarship.

40:47.480 --> 41:02.440
He is a Pinkerton detective from the Houston 
Pinkerton Detective Office, and he's here

40:47.480 --> 41:02.440
infiltrating the SDS group and reporting to 
President Rudder. Did you have that information?

41:05.644 --> 41:06.546
I don't think we did. Talk to Chuck on it. Oh, good. 
Go back to Chuck and confirm that. Does anybody

41:11.913 --> 41:15.698
know what the Pinkerton man discovered? I don't. 
And I doubt if Chuck does. But he gave reports. How

41:23.138 --> 41:24.500
frequently, I don't know. But he took... You're 
mentioning McCandless. Go back to your beginning

41:30.009 --> 41:32.272
months. Who were your key staff people in your 
office? Describe them. Marie Franklo, the

41:38.362 --> 41:40.305
secretary. Describe Ms. Franklo and come 
forward. And... And Skipper Schlesinger.

41:49.734 --> 41:50.815
Schleselman. Schleselman, the associate dean.

41:56.482 --> 42:02.829
Shortly after I came on board, Skipper fell off of a 
ladder while painting his house.

42:05.953 --> 42:07.354
He was in his 60s then. Why he was up on a ladder, I 
don't know. But nonetheless, he fell and broke a

42:10.197 --> 42:13.461
leg, as I recall. And I had the dean's office for 
months with just Marie Franklo and myself.

42:23.626 --> 42:27.050
Mrs. Franklo was such a joy.

42:30.395 --> 42:42.891
She felt that the dean's office,

42:30.395 --> 42:42.891
wherever it was on campus, but that the dean's 
office was the shining light on campus, and it had

42:44.153 --> 42:53.710
to be above reproach in every way. For

42:55.032 --> 43:08.035
example, a little later on, we were able to hire a 
part-time clerk to help Mrs. Franklow during

43:09.753 --> 43:14.881
Skipper's absence.

43:17.505 --> 43:25.456
And the young lady

43:17.505 --> 43:25.456
came to work the first day without any hose on. Mrs. 
Franklow sent her home and says, you go get some

43:26.999 --> 43:30.183
hose on. You're working in the dean's office now. 
But she was She was very diplomatic with faculty,

43:36.871 --> 43:42.618
just outstanding with them. She knew A&M and its 
entire history, I think. She had good contacts

43:51.708 --> 44:02.541
throughout the college with other of her 
colleagues and others. And she had a good

44:03.044 --> 44:06.830
communications linkage.

44:10.236 --> 44:11.698
But she was a joy. And she

44:12.459 --> 44:23.637
was a stickler for accurateness and 
thoroughness. I remember one time I got a

44:23.658 --> 44:25.961
memorandum. I've forgotten from which 
department.

44:32.339 --> 44:35.162
In which there were a couple of misspelled words.

44:39.445 --> 44:43.129
She sent the memorandum in without any comment. I 
quickly identified the misspelled words.

44:47.573 --> 44:48.373
Encircled him. And I said, Miss Frank Lowe, send 
this back to the department. And ask them to.

44:57.121 --> 44:58.743
Revise the memorandum. And send it over in a 
correct form.

45:07.439 --> 45:10.162
Well, she was so pleased with that. She says, 
that's grand. But

45:14.328 --> 45:25.061
it was things like that that she thought was 
important to the dean's office. Now, she was with

45:27.665 --> 45:31.590
you for how many years? She was with me, Haskell. 
She retired. I'm trying to recall now.

45:41.003 --> 45:51.575
When the College of Liberal Arts was organized in 
65, I'm trying

45:41.003 --> 45:51.575
to remember what happened. I think it was about 
that time that she retired. And then she is

45:55.079 --> 45:57.682
followed by? She was followed by Peggy Ritchie.

46:05.090 --> 46:09.255
Peggy had been in a number of locations on campus. 
Peggy had a degree from Lamar and had

46:10.788 --> 46:20.841
worked most recently for Bill Graff. Oh, gosh, 
what a guy. Nonetheless, I asked her if she would

46:26.588 --> 46:35.420
like to come over and join the new College of 
Liberal Arts. She accepted and and was a mainstay

46:37.096 --> 46:41.341
through liberal arts days and education too.

46:44.805 --> 47:06.512
Competent, well

46:44.805 --> 47:06.512
educated, good

46:44.805 --> 47:06.512
solid record keeper, accurate, a stickler for 
perfectionist perfection. And, yes, she was a

47:08.534 --> 47:15.701
younger Marie Franklo, really.

47:19.725 --> 47:21.067
College of Liberal Arts. I was amused. Well, 
that's not the right word for it. I'm amused now

47:27.193 --> 47:34.440
about it, but initially I was distraught.

47:37.458 --> 47:43.127
I'm looking at my watch because I think shortly 
after 11 I'll need to go in, Haskell. Okay, all

47:43.467 --> 47:43.788
right. We're not far from the end of this tape. 
Okay.

47:54.023 --> 48:04.579
In 1970—no,

47:54.023 --> 48:04.579
that's not it. In 1995,

48:06.938 --> 48:18.248
the College of Liberal Arts celebrated its 25th 
anniversary.
