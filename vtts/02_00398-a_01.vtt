00:01.904 --> 00:08.014
This is Mary Lee Nolan in an interview with Mrs. 
Lupe Alemán. What's

00:08.034 --> 00:14.786
her name? Guadalupe Alemán, but Lupe, well, 
Grande is Guadalupe Alemán. And for my father,

00:24.854 --> 00:26.577
González. González. Yes. Lupe González de 
Alemán. Yes, for my husband. Yes. And where were

00:34.769 --> 00:36.492
you born? I was born here in the Nueces County. Yes. 
Yes, I was born here, I was raised here. In what

00:47.509 --> 00:48.891
year? Well, I think I was 17, it seems. And where was 
your father born? My father, well, they are both

00:54.115 --> 00:57.960
from Mexico. But I don't know where they are from. 
No? No. But they invented a lot of... Nanahuato.

01:11.618 --> 01:12.499
Nanahuato? Yes. Rial del Oro, Rial de Pozos. I 
think they are neighbors like Tricorpos. Yes. And

01:21.911 --> 01:23.093
Robstown. And that's what I heard them talking 
about. Yes. And I was born...

01:34.335 --> 01:39.423
I was the first girl, I think, in their family. 
Because I grew up in a place where they worked all

01:40.204 --> 01:48.939
day. They worked. My father, my grandparents, 
they worked all those lands because it was

01:51.811 --> 02:04.204
just a mountain. And they dug a lot with talaches 
and with that they kept us, all of us, they kept

02:04.224 --> 02:17.599
digging, digging and de-rooting. Todos mis tios, 
mis abuelitos, mi papá, And my brother, the one I

02:26.219 --> 02:31.144
have there, I have a brother who lives there in the 
corner. And that brother helped my father because

02:32.265 --> 02:35.889
he was the oldest. But they were born in Mexico, the 
two of them. They just came here, they were raised

02:38.832 --> 02:42.416
here. And he was the oldest and he helped my father. 
To grab the talacha, to dig very hard. He worked

02:47.802 --> 02:53.728
very hard, my little brother and my father, to 
raise the others. Well, and then that I know from

02:55.244 --> 03:07.575
those times that I grew up, that I was knowing, I 
still recognized all that. I

03:07.995 --> 03:15.542
went to where my father worked. I looked at them as 
they worked very hard. And then I looked at many

03:20.987 --> 03:25.251
fields and many people. their clothes hanging on 
the branches, their, this, grinding, making

03:26.598 --> 03:52.420
tortillas, some big firewood, there they put a 
comal like this, they were throwing tortillas,

03:26.598 --> 03:52.420
tortillas, and making their food, well. I met a lot 
of friends like that. So, I would look at what my

03:56.539 --> 04:01.227
grandpa was doing. What is grandpa doing? He would 
say, I am making, they were called, those were

04:03.691 --> 04:10.543
called galemes. Galemes? Galemes, from pure 
land. From pure land, they made from firewood,

04:15.050 --> 04:19.278
from the inside, from pure firewood. And then, 
They would put them like this. Then they would put

04:23.110 --> 04:26.314
grass on the firewood. Then they would put a lot of 
dirt on top of everything. They would cover it with

04:29.818 --> 04:31.480
dirt. That whole pile of dirt. But the firewood 
would stay inside. And then there would be a hole in

04:35.104 --> 04:39.649
the firewood. And they would put a lot of firewood 
in there. And a lot of garbage so that a lot of

04:42.492 --> 04:46.057
firewood would be made. That would burn. It would 
burn. After it burned, I think it lasted, I don't

04:48.914 --> 04:59.528
know much, but it seemed to last three days or a week 
to cook. It was coal, like the one they make now.

05:03.573 --> 05:15.128
Well, then, after it was ready, he was paying, 
paying, and he was getting smaller and smaller.

05:15.148 --> 05:16.710
So, with a rake, they were doing it. And they did it, 
and they did it, and they dug around it, and they

05:17.770 --> 05:28.267
were stretching it with that rake when it was 
already turned off. So, here they had it very

05:29.269 --> 05:39.205
clean, and they were making all that coal like 
this, it had already been done, they did it like

05:29.269 --> 05:39.205
this, like this, all around they dug it with that 
rake. That coal, there were many ribbons, you know

05:40.282 --> 05:45.347
what ribbons are. Well, then they threw all that 
coal, they picked it like a potato. They picked

05:51.773 --> 05:54.996
that coal, they ribbons, the ribbons like that. 
They carried 30, 40 ribbons of that, of pure coal.

06:00.742 --> 06:06.187
The town was very small, the town was very small. 
What was this town called? This little town? Yes.

06:11.782 --> 06:26.518
Well, from what I know, I don't know, but I never 
knew, since I knew what it was called, it was

06:11.782 --> 06:26.518
Corpos, because they took it to Corpos, when there 
were very few shops. My grandpa took it to a huayín

06:27.780 --> 06:33.646
and there were no mules, because those, I think, 
cost more. He had some burritos, sí, sí, y él

06:35.682 --> 06:43.873
llevaba todos esos costalitos en eso y los llevaba 
a corpos. Entonces mi abuelito no quería, mi

06:43.893 --> 06:53.405
abuelito no quería hablar, él le daba vergüenza, 
pero mi abuelita sí iba con él. Mi abuelita era una

06:54.346 --> 06:58.011
señora muy delgadita, She was a very pretty lady, 
but she was dark-skinned. But she had a very pretty

07:04.175 --> 07:09.121
body. She would go out on the street and say, Do you 
buy coal? Yes, the ladies would come out. Good

07:23.498 --> 07:24.379
morning. Good morning. This is my mother. Nice to 
meet you. Oh, here. Here, here. And then she tells

07:35.574 --> 07:41.143
me, well... So, when she talked about all that, the 
ladies and gentlemen would go out to buy my

07:41.164 --> 07:51.522
grandparents. I don't know if at that time it would 
cost about 15 cents, I think a dime. They were very

07:59.618 --> 08:03.125
happy. So with that, they bought everything they 
needed for food. They bought everything they

08:10.908 --> 08:27.245
needed from the food, they came very delighted to 
the house because they brought a lot of food, of

08:10.908 --> 08:27.245
what they wanted with that. Well, they followed 
them around, around with that. Well, following

08:31.189 --> 08:39.177
until they finished that, but they always 
continued to dig, to dig, because they were paid

08:31.189 --> 08:39.177
money for that. An acre, half an acre, they paid for 
it. A fourth, an eighth, they said, that's what

08:43.042 --> 08:48.209
they paid for, what they did. A little, but they 
paid for it. Well, then, that was over and Desenray

08:50.853 --> 08:56.801
continued.

09:00.806 --> 09:06.294
My father, then, he gathered money, he gathered 
money. That was what my grandfather, my father,

09:06.374 --> 09:08.657
did. They gathered money, so I think they met with 
the first boss that I knew, that I thought, that I

09:09.228 --> 09:23.011
thought that my father had that boss. It was Mr. 
Yondón. Yondón. Yondón. Yondón. Uh-huh. His name

09:30.344 --> 09:32.367
was Juan Yondón. Yes. Yes. By the way, they live 
around the 9th before they reach Corpus. They

09:38.820 --> 09:46.132
don't exist anymore, but I think one or two of his 
daughters do exist. Yes. His place is still there,

09:47.595 --> 09:52.823
because it was a very beautiful place. I remember 
he was a fat man. very pink, with a white beard, and

09:57.254 --> 10:06.949
he wore a big hat, and he was a very respectful man. 
But he was a man, like his family, who was also very

10:07.290 --> 10:15.002
kind to Mexicans, because he wasn't Mexican. But 
he was very kind to everyone. Where was he from?

10:22.685 --> 10:23.606
What part? Well, I didn't know what part he was from 
because when I thought about it, it was that he

10:24.067 --> 10:35.681
lived there, he had all his property. I think, who 
knows, he was the first founder of here because he

10:35.701 --> 10:44.831
had a very beautiful house. It was worth a lot of 
money because the house still exists. Well,

10:51.355 --> 10:59.671
my father worked with him for many years. Then my 
father worked with a man, his name was Jose Han. He

11:06.424 --> 11:09.710
was another boss of my father. That boss was a very 
good boss with my father. At that time, my father

11:13.664 --> 11:21.196
was no longer working at St. Ray's. That was pure 
land.

11:29.028 --> 11:30.711
They helped my father. So they helped my father 
because we were already a lot, because we were 12 in

11:32.395 --> 11:39.887
the family. 12? 12 in the family. 12 children? Yes, 
12. This is your mother, correct? Yes, she is my

11:50.343 --> 11:52.506
mother. Your mother is Mrs. Juanita Gonzalez? 
Yes. Correct. And you had 12 children? Yes, you

12:00.644 --> 12:04.189
know it was in 19. I almost had an abortion, but in 
12. God gave me so many families. Maybe it's

12:12.020 --> 12:19.550
possible for your mother to tell me something 
about Mexico. Well, yes. Where were you born?

12:24.477 --> 12:30.145
Well, I wasn't born in Rosario, because before 
they didn't tell their parents anything. I didn't

12:30.428 --> 12:35.515
want anyone to talk to Recio because it would upset 
him. I didn't know

12:35.635 --> 12:42.865
where I was born. No? I didn't know. But you were 
born in Mexico. Yes, I'm from Mexico. In Mexico.

12:46.750 --> 12:47.672
Where in Mexico? I'm from Mexico, in Guanajuato. 
Guanajuato? Yes. In what town or ranch? Well, I

12:54.321 --> 12:55.783
almost grew up in a ranch. A ranch? A pure ranch, 
yes. What's the name of this ranch? Well, the ranch

13:01.107 --> 13:13.475
where my father used to work, well, sometimes 
there was no work here in the mines, and we would go

13:01.107 --> 13:13.475
to the ranch, because we created a mineral in the 
Real de Pozo. Oh, yes. Yes. We grew up there, and

13:15.098 --> 13:20.871
when my father stopped working, he would take us to 
the ranch. We had already worked for two or three

13:21.593 --> 13:29.104
weeks, and we came back from Vuelta a Rodar. It's a 
well. It's a well where they make the money from the

13:31.187 --> 13:34.452
mines. It's on the side of San Luis Potosí. It's on 
the side of San Luis Potosí. Yes, it's very close to

13:46.970 --> 13:49.474
San Luis Potosí. And your father was working with 
mines and also with the fields? Yes, also with the

13:59.284 --> 14:02.988
fields, yes. When he was tired of working with the 
mines,

14:03.048 --> 14:13.239
we would go to the fields to work. One month, one 
week. And in what year were you born, more or less?

14:20.183 --> 14:22.286
Well, how old were you? More or less. When we were 
going there, my dad took me. You? What was your age?

14:38.631 --> 14:45.541
No, mom doesn't know right now, nor do I know. You 
were 90 years old. More or less.

14:54.814 --> 14:57.662
And when did your family come to Texas? Oh, when we 
came to give here, my little boys came every half

14:59.166 --> 15:03.538
year. Before 1910

15:04.244 --> 15:32.698
or after?

15:36.307 --> 15:41.915
Well, for what reason did you come to Texas? 
Because you know that for Mexico there are a lot of

15:41.995 --> 15:47.202
needs. Yes. A lot of work, it's very cheap. Yes. And 
here, since our families were here, they fixed it

15:49.745 --> 15:54.872
and they took us. Yes. Yes, that's why we came here. 
Yes. And was there a war in Mexico these days? We

16:04.943 --> 16:09.990
didn't know about that war, we were already here. 
Wasn't there a war in Mexico? That war that was in

16:13.115 --> 16:17.281
Mexico, we were already here when we knew about 
that war. They were here when they were already

16:18.483 --> 16:21.367
here. They were already here when they were 
already here. They were very sad this war. Yes,

16:28.978 --> 16:29.519
very sad. They were talking about how sad it was. We 
were already here. Yes, I was very young. Did you

16:39.386 --> 16:42.411
have a family here before you came?

16:46.356 --> 16:46.416
No. Is there a family here in Texas? This was the 
first one. Ah, yes, the first girl. La primera

16:58.032 --> 17:02.859
tejana de la familia. Sí. De la familia. Bueno. Sí. 
Tu historia. Continuar.

17:18.301 --> 17:26.352
Bueno, este, no sé ni dónde iba.

17:28.627 --> 17:38.461
I went with the man who was

17:28.627 --> 17:38.461
my father's boss. Yes. Well, after that, those men 
helped my father a lot. And they started to give him

17:42.847 --> 17:47.173
work. And my brothers, we all started to grow. So 
they, I don't know, they gave him... about two,

17:58.816 --> 18:07.831
three, I don't know, about five acres of land.

18:07.851 --> 18:23.799
So, the boss, Mr. Jose Han, he had, he was a man who 
had money, a man who had many mules, horses, quite a

18:07.851 --> 18:23.799
lot. So, We started helping my father because we 
were the three oldest. And my father, that was

18:30.536 --> 18:36.883
everything.

18:36.903 --> 18:44.191
Everything he

18:36.903 --> 18:44.191
gave us. So my father, he helped him and bought 
mules for my father.

18:53.491 --> 19:02.366
He bought a mule for my dad and he bought the first 
thing we worked with. So my dad bought a cow for that

19:02.386 --> 19:17.271
man because the cow was very cheap because dad had a 
family and he was a very good worker and he was a very

19:02.386 --> 19:17.271
good dad. Entonces, él le vendió esa vaca. Esa vaca 
era muy buena y daba mucha leche. Entonces, él

19:27.345 --> 19:29.408
sembraba mucho. Mi papá, él lo ayudó con mulas. Y yo 
no sé si las pagaría mi papá al contado o no sé, pero

19:33.714 --> 19:41.084
él lo ayudó con mulas. Y mi papá, a veces que le 
pasaba una mula bronca y mi papá la amansaba. Y él

19:48.352 --> 20:03.868
trató de comprarse luego luego con su trabajo un 
guayín, un tiro de mulas nuevas, porque él no le

19:48.352 --> 20:03.868
gustaba, le gustaba que trabajaran las mulas 
pronto. Y luego entonces, en ese rancho que le dio

20:05.069 --> 20:12.577
esos cinco acres, no tenía mi papá, no había casa. 
No, no había casa, nomás era el puro lugar. Do you

20:17.495 --> 20:21.920
know what the house was like? It was a very big tree, 
a very beautiful tree. It was very big, like this,

20:26.706 --> 20:30.591
that tree that grew there in the corner of Salabor. 
So my father, I don't know, he bought sheets, what

20:32.033 --> 20:38.601
do you call it? Sheet. Do you know what a sheet is? 
Well, so he bought it. So my father built a house.

20:47.093 --> 20:52.041
The kitchen was big, he made the house like that. 
So, I remember, we all went, we all took, we all went

20:54.004 --> 21:02.737
to that place, but there was no house. But as it 
were, there was this tree. And

21:04.239 --> 21:12.392
then, well, my father was very good, but Entonces, 
mi papá, yo agarré una cobija. ¿Ves? Yo no estaba

21:19.004 --> 21:21.032
muy grande, pero... I grabbed a blanket and I tied 
it on the floor. My father didn't like that I tied

21:26.161 --> 21:28.464
that blanket on the floor. He grabbed one of those 
sticks that hit the mules. I tried to run so they

21:36.575 --> 21:43.624
wouldn't hit me because I was sitting on the 
blanket, but he didn't like that. He said to my

21:43.664 --> 21:49.872
father, I'm going to run, and my father did this and 
I fell. Well, then when I fell down, he told me, you

21:50.054 --> 21:56.100
shouldn't have run, he said. Well, I was going to 
tell you not to throw that mattress on the ground.

22:04.810 --> 22:08.794
It was all I remember that my father was going to hit 
me. Because my father never cursed us, nor did he

22:10.696 --> 22:17.563
ever do us wrong for him. He built that house, and 
then we would step on it. We would step on the

22:22.888 --> 22:27.513
cotton, corn, whatever it was. And he would plant a 
lot of garden all

22:28.254 --> 22:34.923
the time. So he would make us work. There was a lot of 
harvest, a lot of cotton, because the water would

22:37.746 --> 22:45.616
come and the cotton would grow a lot. So he would 
say, They would grab the plow and we would work

22:46.923 --> 22:49.409
here. They would grab the plow, all of us. There was 
a lot of grass. He would help us and guide us and give

22:57.086 --> 23:04.543
us encouragement and everything. Well, I grew up 
with cotton. My father used to sell cotton bags. I

23:14.672 --> 23:20.899
don't know if that man was the fourth, or the 
middle, or I don't know how he did with his boss. But

23:20.919 --> 23:27.045
then, my father always bought the best. With what 
God gave him, he bought skulls, all kinds of tools

23:35.017 --> 23:38.303
that he needed to work, he would buy them. He 
thought about all that because he looked and

23:38.324 --> 23:46.319
because his boss told him.

23:49.105 --> 23:52.191
And he always thought about having them for us. 
Well, then... The owner had a lot of food for the

23:56.617 --> 24:05.191
cows because he had a dairy farm. He had silos that 
were very big and they fed them there. So you would

24:10.641 --> 24:17.933
see a lot of guayines all loaded with pasture. And 
that pasture was carried by the Guayines. They

24:21.819 --> 24:26.725
were paid for that pasture, because they carried 
all that pasture to the machine. He had a machine

24:27.627 --> 24:33.514
that you put the manhojo there, they were pure 
manhojos. They cut it in the work and then they put

24:33.534 --> 24:39.743
it in the barn. You see, they were in the barn. He put 
workers to make the barn, like the Indians, that's

24:41.164 --> 24:46.131
how they did it. Well, then, here were some 
loaders, the guayines arrived, like trunks, and

24:46.111 --> 25:03.127
they threw those loaders, they threw the pasture, 
the guayines, and they put them so high, so high,

24:46.111 --> 25:03.127
that's how they carried the guayines, all out of 
order, to the silos, to the machine. Then, there,

25:03.647 --> 25:13.857
the guayine was like this, throwing all that 
manure there, and the machine was stirring it, and

25:03.647 --> 25:13.857
throwing it into that boat. I think my father was 
paid, I'm not very sure because he didn't tell us,

25:14.461 --> 25:29.297
but I think he was paid like 5 or 10 pesos a day on each 
trip. On each trip he was paid. So he was earning his

25:34.162 --> 25:42.932
money and it was less for him. They ran the guayines 
in a row, like trunks. The first one to arrive would

25:50.401 --> 25:56.792
be the one to be loaded first, and the other one 
would make more trips. Well, then my father with

25:56.812 --> 26:01.561
that guayín maintained the house much better. But 
between the family and my mother, she... and she

26:10.486 --> 26:16.312
would tell my father to buy what he needed all the 
time. She didn't want good clothes, she didn't

26:16.352 --> 26:23.399
want anything good, like now. She wanted my father 
to have what he needed to work. That's what she said

26:27.584 --> 26:30.767
too. So, he, my father, for a long time, he changed 
from there. And then she gave it to me because I

26:39.173 --> 26:46.385
think time was over. So my grandparents, they were 
always with my father, who are her parents. Yes,

26:53.536 --> 26:56.201
they were always with my father. So we went 
somewhere else, always to Don Juan Yondon's

26:56.301 --> 27:01.249
ranch. And it was a house. So it was a house. So it was 
a house that they called the house of three waters.

27:09.347 --> 27:11.431
Because it had three corridors. One like this, 
another like this, another like this, and another

27:11.692 --> 27:16.481
like this. And it was a round house. Ah, how 
beautiful. Yes, there were many rooms. Well, the

27:22.036 --> 27:30.826
house was very big and everything, but there was no 
opportunity to make it nice inside. One put what

27:30.846 --> 27:33.369
one could and what one had. It had many windows and 
everything. Well, there we spent the time,

27:37.374 --> 27:51.790
another more time, that all my friends still have 
Las amigas de los meras amigas de mi papá, de mi

27:52.090 --> 27:56.514
mamá. Ya quedaron nomás los hijos de ellos. 
Entonces, este, se vino el chubasco. Yo no sé en qué

28:07.364 --> 28:11.909
año fue ese chubasco muy grande que acabó Corpus. 
Ah, 1919. Ajá. 1919.

28:18.435 --> 28:19.836
Yes, ma'am. yes yes well then I think I would have 
like some ten years I think what happened during

28:20.255 --> 28:42.803
this chubasco is chubasco the same thing as a 
hurricane Well, I think so, like Celia, almost

28:43.643 --> 28:50.394
like that. Because look, we were in that house, 
that house was very strong. Well, there were my

28:54.861 --> 29:04.656
grandparents, there was a brother of mine who is 
the eldest in the family, my brother was 30 years

28:54.861 --> 29:04.656
old. He didn't get married until he was 30 years 
old. He got married after I got married. Yes. Well,

29:12.492 --> 29:16.197
then, there was all that Gallardo family. They 
came to the strength of the Higronazo because the

29:16.398 --> 29:23.629
house of God was like this. The water was given to 
him like this. That family was given to him like

29:25.512 --> 29:27.555
this. Because of his... Because of the water. Yes, 
his body. His body. The water rose up to here. In the

29:31.080 --> 29:32.082
middle of his body. Yes, the water. And they went, 
they were all tied together and held in their

29:33.340 --> 29:44.720
hands, and the air in their strength and the water, 
and they left with us, all that family. So, there

29:45.782 --> 29:55.298
were my grandparents, there was that family, they 
were two, it was a son and his... and his father,

29:56.392 --> 30:13.945
men, my father and my three brothers

29:56.392 --> 30:13.945
and my father and my three brothers, well, and 
those were five. So they went inside quickly

30:14.195 --> 30:21.348
because the air didn't let them in. So the air came 
like this, right? It lifted the door, it sold it

30:25.857 --> 30:28.281
hard. So they all grabbed a machete and they all ran 
to the side of the door. There was a time when they

30:34.630 --> 30:38.233
locked her up. There were five of them. They locked 
her up, tied her up with a rope, and then they put

30:41.096 --> 30:45.180
something strong on her. So the house was like 
this, but the house never fell. And since they put

30:51.846 --> 31:00.515
pressure on her, that's where the hurricane came 
in, but it didn't come in. Well, everything calmed

31:00.535 --> 31:01.836
down. Everything calmed down and the water 
stayed. So many people came from other places

31:07.553 --> 31:15.584
because they wanted help to help raise the river. 
Because it was destroyed. They looked at us. Do you

31:18.848 --> 31:20.871
know where the river is? That river over there, the 
9th? Yes. Well, that river... Había muchos

31:27.432 --> 31:29.856
árboles y todo. No se miraban árboles. Todo se 
miraba así, pero mirabas tú como un pueblo porque

31:31.900 --> 31:39.533
todo de otras partes se trajo a la agua. Sí. Todo. 
Había... Había cosas de aranzas, de tab, había de

31:42.350 --> 31:51.065
corpos, había de pueblos vecinos. Todo había en 
ese río. Todo había allí. Una negrita la sacaron de

31:55.774 --> 32:01.223
un tanque de aceite. Una señora la hallaron 
colgada en uno de los árboles. Oh, my dad went to

32:06.734 --> 32:10.519
help. My dad and that Gallardo family, the two of 
them went to help. My brothers went to help because

32:16.907 --> 32:28.422
the boss told my dad, come on, help, he said, 
because they need help to lift up the debris that

32:16.907 --> 32:28.422
there was from the chubasco. And all the neighbors 
from there left. They came from many places to help

32:31.847 --> 32:33.810
there. But you looked at it as if it had been a town. 
You looked at how many things there were there. So

32:44.066 --> 32:53.139
the police were taking care of it because there 
were many things of value thrown away. And then

32:53.160 --> 32:56.805
they checked them all, those who were going to help 
them checked them. They didn't bring anything.

32:59.487 --> 33:07.897
But I'm not saying that I'm in favor of my parents or 
anything. But my parents taught us to respect

33:07.997 --> 33:11.160
others. And they respected me because I never told 
them to bring anything to the house. From what was

33:16.145 --> 33:18.268
there, no. I never saw anything. I never knew 
anything because they never brought anything.

33:25.945 --> 33:34.678
Well, then, after a short time, all of that, for a 
long time, they kept raising all of that. After a

33:34.698 --> 33:39.746
short time, we left from there. We all left for that 
ranch that still exists, but the owners don't.

33:46.175 --> 33:49.220
Here it is, it was Jose Yaliva. After that, from 
that ranch, We went to... what is the 9th street?

34:02.252 --> 34:03.775
It's the 9th street and we were there. Do you know 
where the 9th street is? 37, number 37. Hey

34:09.025 --> 34:14.374
Virginia, is the 9th street, what number is it? 
It's the 9th street. That's how we named it. That's

34:21.443 --> 34:24.066
how we named it. That's how we named it. That's how 
we named it. That's how we named it. That's how we

34:38.503 --> 34:44.130
named it. Yes, but she was Italian. Yes, she was 
Italian. Her wife was Mexican. She was a very

34:53.091 --> 34:56.074
beautiful lady. And they were very nice. So they 
had a house because they were the first founders of

34:59.738 --> 35:07.046
Corpus. So my father and they went to that place 
because that man told him, Gonzales, I don't know

35:14.722 --> 35:23.069
how they would fix it, but he said he would pass his 
land to him so he could plant it. Like my father, he

35:25.131 --> 35:43.868
already had everything, so he said, well, but I 
don't have a house, he said, but I have a little

35:25.131 --> 35:43.868
house, and that little house only had a room, as 
long as here, and the kitchen was divided, and it

35:25.131 --> 35:43.868
was small. He said, there you go, he said, in the 
meantime, he said, but it's very good land, and

35:44.118 --> 35:51.388
it's enough. So he said, my dad, it's good. And so we 
went to that place. So it was on the other side of

36:00.741 --> 36:07.910
that place, there was another land, and it was from 
another Italian. Yes. Yes, they were... The only

36:10.493 --> 36:16.684
friends of the other Italians were friends. So 
they had a very nice house because those families

36:17.205 --> 36:23.617
were the first ones. They had a two-story house 
that still exists. It was a two-story house, so my

36:29.798 --> 36:37.449
father was very close to them. They were very close 
since my father came here and met all of that

36:37.469 --> 36:41.995
family.

36:44.599 --> 36:49.045
They had their parents from those Italians. They 
were very young, both of them. My father and mother

36:53.291 --> 36:56.196
were this size. Both of them were old. But they 
didn't know any Spanish, but they were always

36:58.469 --> 37:04.845
good. And my father had a very good friendship with 
them. When my father needed something, He would go

37:15.378 --> 37:19.624
with him. When my father needed to borrow money, 
the man, that cigarette, would lend money to my

37:19.684 --> 37:29.958
father until the year was over. When the year was 
over, with what my father raised, he would pay 200,

37:29.978 --> 37:42.415
300 pesos to that man, with what my father raised, 
to live with us. Bueno, entonces cuando él tenía

37:43.897 --> 37:49.401
trabajo, mi papá, He was going to work with him. 
When he didn't have money, he was going to work with

37:51.379 --> 37:54.162
him. He helped him a lot. My father really liked to 
play in the barrage. They really liked to play in

37:59.910 --> 38:04.156
the barrage, the Italians. They looked for my 
father. My father, the day he didn't work, he was up

38:05.878 --> 38:15.271
until one in the morning, at four, with them, 
playing in the barrage. They had a very good time

38:15.351 --> 38:18.054
with them. He was... They were two brothers, they 
were Italians. They loved my father very much.

38:25.512 --> 38:30.744
Well, then, they helped us all the time. If he said, 
Hey, Fernando, are you going? Because my father's

38:39.004 --> 38:42.388
name was Fernando. So he said, I want you to lend me a 
boy so that I can roll the cotton or whatever. So my

38:48.955 --> 38:56.985
father says, well, you know, the boys are busy 
here, but if you want, my girl is going to help you.

38:57.005 --> 38:58.667
Oh, that's good, Fernando. We make the roll and all 
that. Well, I was going to roll the work that they

39:01.859 --> 39:07.085
wanted, I was going to do it. Well, then he had two 
girls, that man had, his name was Juan, the other

39:09.007 --> 39:21.700
one was called Rocky and the other one was called 
Juan. So my father treated the older one, who was

39:21.720 --> 39:26.446
Juan. Well, then he says he had, Three

39:30.918 --> 39:34.563
girls. And those girls, they were average, those 
girls. Only one of them was the oldest. So, they

39:43.294 --> 39:50.884
grew up, well, not much, but they were always big, 
the oldest. Because they didn't let me, like now,

39:52.163 --> 39:58.210
they didn't let me play a lot. They only gave me a 
certain amount of time to play with my friends.

40:05.279 --> 40:07.882
That was one friend. My cousin was another friend 
because my aunt lived next door to those Italians.

40:21.762 --> 40:32.481
Y mi prima, pues casi era de la camada mía, pues 
tendría yo creo como algunos once o doce años,

40:21.762 --> 40:32.481
nosotros las tres. At that time, the girl was 
Italian. She had long hair and a beautiful family

40:38.744 --> 40:44.853
braid. I went to my mother and asked her, Lupita, 
will your mother let you come to my house? I said, I

40:50.902 --> 40:54.688
don't think so, because I'm working. She said, I'm 
going to tell your mom. And she came early. And she

40:58.050 --> 41:04.604
said, Mrs. Juanita, let Lupita go play with me for a 
little while. And Trinda, my cousin, said, well,

41:04.624 --> 41:09.735
she said, mom, well, go. She said, but just for a 
little while, Lupe. Half an hour. or Asina. We used

41:15.958 --> 41:17.941
to go and play together. I used to play with the 
other cousin for a little while, either at her

41:17.981 --> 41:22.748
house or at my house. For a little while, and then 
we'd go home. Lupita would say, well, I'm leaving.

41:28.156 --> 41:29.538
I'd go home soon. But it wasn't all the time. It was 
only once a week. Or on Sundays, I'd do everything I

41:35.166 --> 41:43.018
could, and I'd have it on Sundays, but it was at my 
house, and my friends would go there. to play with

41:43.370 --> 41:49.215
me, because I really liked the ball game. And I 
still like the ball

41:49.235 --> 41:56.662
game. And then, well, she begged a lot, that year 
that we were there, she begged a lot, my little

41:56.762 --> 42:12.195
friend, my mom and my dad, because my dad was in 
charge. Entonces dice, ¿por qué no la dejan ir a

42:13.053 --> 42:17.876
Lupita que vaya a la escuela? Yo nunca he ido a la 
escuela. Nunca. Why not? Because the schools were

42:22.320 --> 42:28.372
retired. They weren't very retired, but the 
parents were always stricter. In short, the

42:33.481 --> 42:40.034
parents in those years didn't know what one could 
be missing. Not even one could think of that.

42:45.892 --> 43:05.177
Entonces, de allí estaba retirado, no estaba muy 
retirado, pero podíamos ir a pie como íbamos

42:45.892 --> 43:05.177
entonces, porque cuando esa amiguita me animó y a 
mi papá que me dejara ir, que me dejara ir a la

42:45.892 --> 43:05.177
escuela, entonces me dijo, pues está bueno que 
vaya a la escuela, dijo mi papá y mi mamá, pues que

42:45.892 --> 43:05.177
vaya a la escuela. Pues que entonces ella estaba 
bien contenta porque allí no había amiguitas para

43:06.098 --> 43:15.730
que fueran de allí de ese barrio para que fueran con 
ella, nomás yo, mi prima y mi primo. So, we went to

43:16.452 --> 43:19.695
the school. That school was made by Mr. Jose Jante. 
They told him. He was my father's boss. He made that

43:33.529 --> 43:37.373
school, which is on the way down. I don't know if it 
will be closed. On the way down, there is a school on

43:39.295 --> 43:44.620
the same road. So we went to school and she had a lot 
of white friends, but she didn't leave us. She

44:00.446 --> 44:04.752
always ran and talked with us. Before leaving, she 
would go to the street and tell me, Lupita, because

44:05.187 --> 44:22.892
there was a mountain there, a little bit of a 
mountain, and she had my flip-flops, and I would

44:05.187 --> 44:22.892
get together with my cousin, and there weren't 
many Mexicans, so she would say, Lupita, No te

44:22.872 --> 44:25.835
vayas a ir y me dejes sola. Dice, Lupe, yo te doy un 
sándwich. Dice, pa' que me esperes, me decía. Le

44:31.622 --> 44:34.125
decía yo, pues dile a mi prima. Le decía, si ella me 
espera a mí, entonces yo te espero a ti. No necesito

44:39.512 --> 44:40.913
sándwich. Entonces decía, ay, Lupita, por favor, 
dice, espérame. So I said, well, and I said to my

44:45.839 --> 44:55.289
cousin, let's go, let's go, because she doesn't 
come with us when we're here, she doesn't come with

44:45.839 --> 44:55.289
us, she says, it's better to go. Oh no, I said to her, 
let's wait, poor thing, let's wait. Well, well,

44:59.092 --> 45:02.196
I'm not going to go, I'm going to wait for her. Well, 
then we were waiting for her. And she did go with us.

45:07.541 --> 45:14.428
So when we were going, she was sharing sandwiches 
with us and my cousin always Well, she didn't like

45:14.864 --> 45:17.570
it. So she said, she said, oh, yes, she said, oh, 
don't lick me so much that I don't have a ranch. She

45:25.587 --> 45:30.658
said, she said, my cousin, oh, cousin, why are you 
so bad? I said, well, playing like that, well,

45:30.678 --> 45:34.847
then. Ay, pues que mi primer maestra que ya murió, 
fue primera y última maestra que yo tuve, fue Miss

45:35.536 --> 45:44.610
Bessie. Bueno, esa maestra fue una maestra que 
vino de otros estados, esa maestra.
