00:01.702 --> 00:23.001
In late 1987 and in 1988, there was a great deal of 
excitement in the House of South Texas area about

00:01.702 --> 00:23.001
the expansion of higher education in South Texas 
and the further development of

00:25.428 --> 00:31.517
this area with regards to institutions of higher 
education. There was no question that South Texas

00:33.139 --> 00:39.869
had been neglected with regards to higher 
education. And the legislators in South Texas

00:41.292 --> 00:53.730
placed the blame at the feet of the legislature as a 
whole. The truth of the matter is that the

00:54.757 --> 01:03.869
legislature responds to requests that are made by 
individual legislators. Not that they always get

01:04.710 --> 01:09.156
what they ask for, but they first have to ask for it. 
Now Texas, by 1987, had emerged from the old

01:10.718 --> 01:24.696
patrone system that really had little regard for 
higher education for its masses. and most of the

01:26.093 --> 01:31.039
legislators responded accordingly. I recall one 
time in earlier years when I was serving in the

01:32.540 --> 01:55.847
legislature, this was about 1974 as I can best 
remember, I struck up a conversation with the

01:32.540 --> 01:55.847
state representative from Duval County one day 
and I stated that I see that he has an opponent in the

01:57.177 --> 02:04.584
election.

02:07.866 --> 02:12.631
And he was devoting some time to campaigning. Let 
me know very quickly that he did not have to

02:14.072 --> 02:26.543
campaign, that George Parr elected him, and see to 
it that he was reelected. This particular state

02:26.962 --> 02:40.470
representative at that time had I'm sure no 
interest in promoting higher education in South

02:26.962 --> 02:40.470
Texas.

02:40.510 --> 02:46.202
In 87 and 88 all of this had changed with the 
election of a new generation of legislators that

02:48.275 --> 02:59.585
were no longer under the control of certain 
politically powerful individuals. This is not to

03:00.746 --> 03:15.700
suggest that all state representatives and 
senators in South Texas were under anyone's

03:00.746 --> 03:15.700
person's control, such as George Parr, is simply 
to point out that there was that environment in

03:16.372 --> 03:29.272
South Texas

03:16.372 --> 03:29.272
in the earlier years and prior years. We began to 
think about what we would be proposing to the joint

03:30.574 --> 03:43.695
committee that was established to look at higher 
education in South Texas. We came to certain

03:44.755 --> 04:00.711
conclusions, but recognized the fact that the 
University of Texas system would need to be

03:44.755 --> 04:00.711
conferred with on all these matters. There were 
essentially five institutions, three that

04:01.872 --> 04:10.881
existed within the University of South Texas 
system.

04:14.320 --> 04:26.539
i.e., Corpus Christi State University, Texas A&I 
University in Kingsville, and Laredo State

04:14.320 --> 04:26.539
University in Laredo. In Edinburgh, Texas, there 
was Pan American University with a branch in

04:28.402 --> 04:35.232
Brownsville. that was strictly an upper-level 
institution and located on the Junior College

04:36.224 --> 04:45.409
campus in Brownsville, Texas. Our initial 
meeting with the University of Texas System

04:46.853 --> 04:52.107
Chancellor that they were interested in Pan 
American University at Edinburgh with its branch

04:53.572 --> 05:17.638
in Brownsville and Laredo State University 
becoming a part of the University of Texas system

04:53.572 --> 05:17.638
and leaving the Texas A&M University system with 
Corpus Christi State University and Texas A&I

04:53.572 --> 05:17.638
University. in Laredo State University was 
because of the fact they had University of Texas at

05:18.479 --> 05:46.512
El Paso on the border to the west and would have Pan 
American University in Brownsville campus to the

05:18.479 --> 05:46.512
east and would like to have Laredo since it was also 
located on the border. There was a great deal of

05:48.095 --> 06:14.727
interest in international trade with Mexico at 
the time and the University of Texas System

05:48.095 --> 06:14.727
Chancellor felt like that they, being the 
University of Texas System, would like to take the

05:48.095 --> 06:14.727
lead in international trade and therefore would 
like to have Laredo State University in their

05:48.095 --> 06:14.727
system.

06:16.023 --> 06:24.015
impression was that this would be the final result 
for several reasons. Number one, Pan American

06:24.155 --> 06:35.231
University had almost become a part of the 
University of Texas system some years earlier and

06:24.155 --> 06:35.231
there had always been that close tie. Number two, 
the state senator in the Lareda area was a graduate

06:36.333 --> 06:45.186
of the University of Texas system and would 
probably lean toward putting Laredo in the

06:45.436 --> 06:52.686
University of Texas system. The A&I University 
was a logical fit with Texas A&M University

06:53.708 --> 07:02.140
because of the programs that they offered. And the 
Texas system chancellor had let the people in

07:03.081 --> 07:12.895
Corpus Christi know that they were not interested 
in Corpus Christi. I failed to take into account

07:13.870 --> 07:26.824
was the fact that the University of Texas system 
had two other upper level institutions within its

07:13.870 --> 07:26.824
system already. One at Tyler and the University of 
Texas at Permian Basin. The state was an upper

07:35.794 --> 07:42.662
level institution as well as Corpus Christi State 
University. It was not long until we were notified

07:43.351 --> 07:59.073
that the University of Texas system had no 
interest in Laredo State University becoming a

07:43.351 --> 07:59.073
part of their system. The reason became quite 
obvious that they did not want to take in any

08:01.745 --> 08:14.364
upper-level institutions that were interested 
in becoming four-year institutions.

08:16.727 --> 08:24.158
It's quite evident that both Corpus Christi State 
University and Laredo State University wanted

08:16.727 --> 08:24.158
four-year status. left the Texas A&M University 
system with the old South Texas system intact,

08:24.965 --> 08:48.377
i.e., Corpus Christi State University, Texas 
A&I, and Laredo, with the University of Texas

08:24.965 --> 08:48.377
system picking up Pan American University and its 
branch in Brownsville. For the

08:48.397 --> 08:54.685
misunderstandings in the merger talk, was the 
Chamber of Commerce people thinking that if they

08:54.800 --> 09:12.319
joined the University of Texas system or the Texas 
A&M University system, they would become heirs of

08:54.800 --> 09:12.319
the permanent university fund. They just had not 
read the Texas Constitution, which clearly would

09:13.413 --> 09:27.629
leave these institutions outside of the 
Permanent University Fund and continue in the

09:13.413 --> 09:27.629
Higher Education Assistance Fund. Hearings were 
held during this interim period in

09:29.091 --> 09:40.163
Brownsville, Edinburgh, and Laredo.

09:43.315 --> 09:55.790
I recall that the University of Texas system 
chancellor and I traveled together attending

09:43.315 --> 09:55.790
those hearings and testifying before the joint 
committee. In those hearings that the University

09:57.192 --> 10:09.627
of Texas system chancellor made it clear that they 
could not support an institution moving from an

09:57.192 --> 10:09.627
upper level status to four year status. On the 
other hand, I was authorized by the NM System Board

10:10.467 --> 10:25.320
of Regents to say that we would support such a move 
if the legislature so designated. Later on, I will

10:27.162 --> 10:39.293
discuss the name change controversy

10:27.162 --> 10:39.293
with regards to the South Texas Institution's 
merger into the Texas A&M University System and

10:40.083 --> 10:58.783
the Lieutenant Governor's later interest in 
moving the Laredo State University

10:40.083 --> 10:58.783
to the University of Texas System.

11:02.968 --> 11:08.554
As we moved into the legislative session 
convening in January of 1989,

11:11.251 --> 11:20.520
was evident to me that we were going to have a 
struggle with regards to the general revenue

11:11.251 --> 11:20.520
appropriations to higher education. 
Representative Tom Uher, who had been a champion

11:22.182 --> 11:39.739
for higher education, had been removed from his 
position as chairman of the Budget and Oversight

11:22.182 --> 11:39.739
Committee in the House Committee on Higher 
Education.

11:41.103 --> 11:59.213
the chairman of the House Appropriations 
Committee had instructed

11:41.103 --> 11:59.213
all proposals

11:41.103 --> 11:59.213
to contain a 5% reduction in general revenue 
appropriations. The chairman of the Budget and

12:00.391 --> 12:26.768
Oversight Committee that sat on the Higher 
Education Committee and the Appropriations

12:00.391 --> 12:26.768
Committee

12:00.391 --> 12:26.768
began to make the 5% reductions, but the cuts were 
even deeper than that because he was adding

12:00.391 --> 12:26.768
special items for members that served on his 
committee. A school was not on the committee. they

12:30.209 --> 12:38.824
resulted, the school got even bigger cuts than 5%.

12:39.204 --> 12:55.592
Though Representative Uher had been removed from 
the subcommittee that made the proposal to the

12:39.204 --> 12:55.592
Higher Education Committee and then on to the 
Appropriations Committee, he still was a member

12:55.927 --> 13:00.575
of the Higher Education Committee. He approached 
me and the rest of higher education with a proposal

13:02.899 --> 13:21.310
that we fund higher education with a $500 million 
increase that would be fairly and evenly spread

13:02.899 --> 13:21.310
throughout higher education. The University of 
Texas system had created a model for doing this,

13:22.184 --> 13:35.384
and so it was suggested that they would furnish the 
dollar amounts to Representative Uher. We're

13:37.066 --> 13:48.664
working on a very short time fuse, but University 
of Texas system officials felt like that they

13:37.066 --> 13:48.664
could accomplish this in very short order. We had 
less than one week to get all this done. After a few

13:53.764 --> 14:10.082
days had passed, I decided to do a follow-up to be 
sure that the University of Texas system was

13:53.764 --> 14:10.082
putting together a proposal that Representative 
Uher had requested. Learned that they planned to

14:11.303 --> 14:16.609
do nothing about it, even though they had said they 
would. Learning this, I asked our officials here

14:17.737 --> 14:30.256
at the Texas A&M University System if they could 
put together such a proposal within a matter of

14:17.737 --> 14:30.256
hours. We were able to do this and carry it to 
Representative Uher and to all of higher

14:32.059 --> 14:40.993
education the following week. Representative 
Uher offered his substitute to the full Committee

14:43.184 --> 14:49.492
on Higher Education, and it passed. However, when 
the proposal reached the House Appropriations

14:51.014 --> 15:11.740
Committee, Chairman Rudd refused to accept it 
because it was over the 5% reduction that, in fact,

14:51.014 --> 15:11.740
had an increase that he had said that he wanted in 
the proposal that came forward. Interesting to

15:14.862 --> 15:23.502
note, however, that within a few days following 
this proposal being presented to the House

15:14.862 --> 15:23.502
Appropriations Committee The committee 
chairman and the speaker reversed their

15:23.735 --> 15:42.198
positions and decided that these reductions 
would not be in order and that they would no longer

15:23.735 --> 15:42.198
be imposed by the chairman.

15:45.142 --> 15:51.750
The 1989 General Appropriations Act did in fact 
include about four to five hundred million

15:51.899 --> 16:06.483
dollars additional funds for higher education, 
almost identical in dollar amounts to those that

15:51.899 --> 16:06.483
Representative Uher had proposed. The bill to 
transfer the

16:14.478 --> 16:37.788
South Texas institutions into the Texas A&M 
University system and the University of Texas

16:14.478 --> 16:37.788
system that has been previously discussed was 
filed as two separate bills and were passed

16:14.478 --> 16:37.788
through the legislature with relative ease. One 
of the issues that was in the bill to transfer the

16:43.958 --> 16:56.794
South Texas University system into the Texas A&M 
University system dealt with the changing of the

16:43.958 --> 16:56.794
names of those institutions. Regents at that time 
objected to the dealing with the name changes in

16:58.336 --> 17:13.155
the bill and asked me to discuss it with the author 
of the bill. They did this and the author agreed to

17:13.895 --> 17:27.529
withdraw the provision in the bill that provided 
for name changes of the South Texas institutions.

17:27.549 --> 17:42.585
There was a separate bill passed that gave the A&M 
System Board of Regents the authority to make

17:27.549 --> 17:42.585
these name changes.

17:44.017 --> 18:06.501
A&M Board took no action on this matter for quite 
some time, which led to infuriating

17:44.017 --> 18:06.501
the senators in the South Texas system and the 
lieutenant governor at a later date. I will

18:08.263 --> 18:12.387
discuss when we get to 1993. There were other bills 
in 1989 that were significant to the Texas A&M

18:14.735 --> 18:23.005
University System. One that

18:24.267 --> 18:42.289
specifically mentioned Texas A&M or the Texas A&M 
University System was a bill to

18:24.267 --> 18:42.289
publish a Central Texas College in Killeen and a 
private college on the Central Texas College

18:43.552 --> 19:02.973
campus and create a four-year institution in 
Killeen near Fort Hood known as Central Texas

18:43.552 --> 19:02.973
University. The bill was passed by 
Representative Stan Sleater with the

19:12.914 --> 19:24.951
understanding that he would be later interested 
in making it a part of the A&M system but did not want

19:12.914 --> 19:24.951
to deal with that issue at this time. The bill had a 
future date of 1999 that the new university would

19:26.974 --> 19:38.010
be created, provided certain obligations were 
taken care of and the two existing boards were

19:38.783 --> 19:53.826
abolished, creating a new board for a 
state-supported institution. One of the

19:55.528 --> 20:07.947
concessions that Representative Sleater had to 
make to get the bill passed and signed, or not

19:55.528 --> 20:07.947
passed, but signed by the governor, Ann Richards, 
was to agreed to pass a bill in a special session

20:10.272 --> 20:28.094
that would follow to allow the Coordinating Board 
to approve this new institution before it became

20:10.272 --> 20:28.094
in effect. Representative Sleater did 
subsequently pass such a bill which required the

20:30.297 --> 20:38.828
Coordinating Board's approval of the new 
institution prior to it coming into existence.

20:48.765 --> 21:02.605
This is still a pending matter and has not been 
resolved by the Coordinating Board at this time

20:48.765 --> 21:02.605
that I am at this time of this being written. The 
1989 regular session was a session that the

21:04.424 --> 21:14.334
student recreation sports fee was established 
for Texas A&M University. This generated the

21:15.275 --> 21:30.972
funds and the bonding allowance,

21:15.275 --> 21:30.972
bonding authority for

21:15.275 --> 21:30.972
the building of the student recreation

21:31.745 --> 21:42.042
center that is now one of the magnificent 
facilities on the Texas A&M campus. There was

21:42.713 --> 21:58.174
concern on the part of the local legislator that 
the students might not want to assess themselves

21:42.713 --> 21:58.174
for the fee to build the facility since they would 
never get to use it by the time it was built. And this

21:59.516 --> 22:02.360
was really something that the administration 
wanted. But we were able to convince the

22:03.201 --> 22:11.893
legislature that the students really and truly 
did want it and were willing to pay for it. Issues in

22:13.325 --> 22:22.140
the appropriations process was the threat of 
losing accreditation of the vet school. The

22:23.522 --> 22:36.143
veterinary school at Texas A&M had been 
threatened with loss of accreditation if they did

22:23.522 --> 22:36.143
not improve their facilities. This

22:36.123 --> 23:02.670
may have not been as serious a threat as it first 
appeared, but was used as leverage to get

22:36.123 --> 23:02.670
appropriations

22:36.123 --> 23:02.670
for the vet school and to bring the board around to 
appropriating the funds to build additional

22:36.123 --> 23:02.670
facilities at the vet school. The discussion and 
hearing regarding the accreditation of the vet

23:04.000 --> 23:21.971
school led to a rider that required whatever 
tuition the vet school raised to be spent on the

23:04.000 --> 23:21.971
programs at that particular school. This removed 
some of the flexibility that had previously been

23:30.224 --> 23:45.685
given Texas A&M in expending their tuition 
revenue monies that were not designated for any

23:30.224 --> 23:45.685
particular college or school within the Texas 
A&M. After 1989, the Texas A&M University System

23:45.945 --> 23:59.623
Board of Regents had decided to develop and build 
the facilities for an Institute of Biosciences

23:45.945 --> 23:59.623
and Technology on the side of the old Shamrock 
Hotel building in Houston, Texas, which is across

24:00.127 --> 24:12.340
the street and on Main Street from the Texas 
Medical Center. Funds were generated from

24:13.702 --> 24:24.413
primarily federal sources and some private 
sources to get the buildings built. U.S. Senator

24:25.426 --> 24:35.803
Lloyd Benson was chiefly responsible in getting 
these funds in the appropriations bills over the

24:25.426 --> 24:35.803
years at the federal level. before the 1989 Texas 
legislature was the need for funding the facility

24:37.133 --> 24:50.734
for operational expenses once it was open. This 
was to be primarily a research or solely a research

24:51.476 --> 25:04.997
facility to work with the Texas Medical Center. 
and would give the Texas Medical Center access to

25:05.652 --> 25:13.543
the expertise on the main campus at Texas A&M 
University. The Texas A&M System Board of Regents

25:15.667 --> 25:31.069
had the authority to establish the institute 
without legislative approval, but it had been my

25:15.667 --> 25:31.069
experience that if the legislature acted 
affirmatively on such a program, there was a

25:31.302 --> 25:36.951
better chance of getting appropriation. So we 
decided to and asked the legislature to

25:38.896 --> 25:56.044
officially sanction the program by a bill that 
would establish the Institute of Biosciences and

25:38.896 --> 25:56.044
Technology in Houston as a part of Texas A&M 
University. I think this did, in fact, get us a $7.5

25:57.787 --> 26:03.216
million appropriation for that biennium, for the 
upcoming biennium beginning in 1989 for the

26:03.787 --> 26:10.121
Institute. Without the accompanying bill, we 
very likely would not have gotten funding for the

26:12.185 --> 26:18.820
Institute. Very similar program,

26:24.239 --> 26:32.687
was one in Galveston at Texas A&M University, 
Galveston, called the Texas Institute of

26:24.239 --> 26:32.687
Oceanography. The Texas Institute of 
Oceanography, as the Institute of Bioscience and

26:33.789 --> 26:50.365
Technology, could be approved and established by 
the Texas A&M University System Board of Regents.

26:50.767 --> 26:54.912
But here again, the question was a matter of 
funding. So a bill was filed to create, by

26:55.794 --> 27:14.157
legislative act, the Texas Institute of 
Oceanography in Galveston in hopes that we could

26:55.794 --> 27:14.157
get an appropriations attached to that or to 
accompany that creation. Again, this was...

27:19.049 --> 27:28.261
done very similar to the Institute of Biosciences 
and Technology, and a $1.3 million appropriation

27:19.049 --> 27:28.261
was attached. Incidentally, the Texas Institute 
of Oceanography is created and allows A&M to work

27:29.042 --> 27:42.440
with the University of Texas in its research 
programs. I'm not sure whether that has ever

27:42.460 --> 27:44.803
happened. been accomplished or not, but it is a 
part of the legislation. The Texas A&M University

27:50.893 --> 28:08.395
system was fortunate in 1989 to have the 
appointment of its own local state senator from

27:50.893 --> 28:08.395
Bryan College Station appointed as chairman of 
the Senate Finance Committee. This came about as a

28:09.927 --> 28:19.601
result of the defeat of the chairman of the Senate 
Finance Committee in his local district, Senator

28:09.927 --> 28:19.601
Grant Jones. Later than the appointment of 
Caperton, most of the leadership in the

28:20.703 --> 28:31.058
legislature remained about the same as it was in 
1987. During the elections in 1990, Senator

28:32.523 --> 28:55.440
Caperton of Bryan chose not to seek re-election 
and convening of the legislative session in 1991,

28:32.523 --> 28:55.440
Senator John Monford was named chairman of the 
Senate Finance Committee. Chairman Monford was

28:55.460 --> 29:00.167
appointed by Lieutenant Governor Bob Bullock. 
The leadership in the House remained the same.

29:04.704 --> 29:11.005
Gibb Lewis was Speaker and Jim Rudd remained as 
Chairman of the House Appropriations Committee.

29:12.469 --> 29:13.633
1991. The 1991 regular session of the Texas 
Legislature would be the first session that the

29:14.052 --> 29:36.921
three South Texas schools, Corpus Christi State 
University, Laredo State University, and Texas

29:14.052 --> 29:36.921
A&I would function as a part of the Texas A&M 
University system. One of the major concerns of

29:38.352 --> 29:58.656
Corpus Christi State University and Laredo State 
University was the problem of how to construct

29:38.352 --> 29:58.656
facilities on those campuses and where the monies 
could come from.

30:01.387 --> 30:27.259
I had suggested to the president of Corpus Christi 
State University when the question arose that

30:01.387 --> 30:27.259
years before, tuition revenue bonds had been 
authorized by the legislature and might be a

30:01.387 --> 30:27.259
possible source of funds for the building of 
facilities on that campus. Tuition revenue bonds

30:27.762 --> 30:46.481
sound like a great idea at first until you realize 
that it's really money, if they're really general

30:27.762 --> 30:46.481
revenue bonds, you're taking the money directly 
out of the general revenue to replace the tuition

30:27.762 --> 30:46.481
revenue that is used to retire those bonds. 
Otherwise, the institution would suffer a great

30:48.683 --> 30:55.069
loss of revenue that it needs for its operations. A 
bill was drafted authorizing Corpus Christi

30:59.072 --> 31:17.580
State University to sell bonds, pledging tuition 
revenue from throughout the Texas A&M University

30:59.072 --> 31:17.580
system, and the bill was passed and became law. 
Earlier that same year, there was a special

31:18.252 --> 31:48.192
session, and Laredo State University,

31:18.252 --> 31:48.192
having a similar problem, decided to copy the bill 
that Corpus Christi State University had passed

31:18.252 --> 31:48.192
authorizing the sale of bonds pledging tuition 
revenue of the Texas A&M University system. The

31:50.011 --> 32:09.724
radar state was able to get a bill through in that 
special session, and so they were likewise

31:50.011 --> 32:09.724
authorized to pledge tuition revenue of the A&M 
system to sell bonds to raise funds for capital

31:50.011 --> 32:09.724
improvements. It was about this time that I 
decided to once again try to develop a grassroots

32:11.712 --> 32:22.566
program for the Texas A&M University System. This 
later became known as TAMUS LIFE, which is an

32:24.989 --> 32:37.645
acronym for the Texas A&M University System 
Legislative Information for Education. New

32:39.448 --> 32:41.230
programs have been developed around the country, 
but they were springing up because of the lack of

32:41.682 --> 32:55.523
support for higher education, and most of this was 
because of the economic times that we were going

32:41.682 --> 32:55.523
through. I began to review what other states were 
doing and found out that most of these successful

32:57.258 --> 33:09.879
programs were being operated by the alumni 
associations in various states. There were some

33:10.861 --> 33:20.076
states like Indiana where several universities 
had gone together to create one statewide

33:10.861 --> 33:20.076
organization. The Texas A&M University system 
was a system consisting of a number of

33:21.018 --> 33:26.366
institutions. I knew that the alumni connection 
would not work as a way to spin off a grassroots

33:26.466 --> 33:37.281
organization. The only model for a system 
operating such a program was California. It

33:45.472 --> 33:50.940
appeared to have a very successful program that 
operated at the system level. The more I learned

33:52.557 --> 34:05.811
about grassroots organizations in other states, 
the more encouraged I became that Texas A&M

33:52.557 --> 34:05.811
University System needed a similar program. So 
hopeful that we could link up with the University

34:07.893 --> 34:13.979
of Texas System, but this never occurred. I did run 
across two studies where legislators and former

34:15.621 --> 34:21.467
legislators were surveyed, to determine what 
influenced them with regards to their decisions

34:22.072 --> 34:26.717
on higher education. The two states that had 
conducted a survey were Florida and Alabama. The

34:34.145 --> 34:42.194
results of the two are very similar, and I will not 
go into detail with regards to those results of

34:34.145 --> 34:42.194
those studies. However, to summarize, they both 
agreed that their own lifetime experiences,

34:42.935 --> 34:52.045
speaking now of legislators, was the greatest 
influencing factor.

34:58.967 --> 35:10.539
There's nothing that a grassroots organization 
can do to change or influence the lifetime

34:58.967 --> 35:10.539
experiences that a legislator has had with 
regards to higher education. Moving on to the

35:11.420 --> 35:19.028
second most important influencing factor was a 
trusted friend. areas where a grassroots

35:20.392 --> 35:35.827
organization can have a tremendous impact by 
identifying those trusted friends and asking

35:20.392 --> 35:35.827
them to assist whenever the need arises. It's 
interesting to note that at the very bottom of the

35:37.189 --> 35:46.518
scale were such factors as radio ads, TV ads, 
newspapers, and billboards. These were at the

35:47.579 --> 35:49.521
bottom of the list of priorities as far as 
legislators are concerned in influencing

35:50.108 --> 35:59.720
factors. Our effort with Tempest Live was to set 
out to identify friends of legislators that would

35:59.740 --> 36:10.072
speak favorably for higher education and the A&M 
system schools.

36:12.896 --> 36:18.883
There were several deterrents to this being as 
successful a program as it could be. For one, the

36:19.471 --> 36:32.772
newer schools that had come in saw Texas A&M 
University as the enemy because they were not

36:19.471 --> 36:32.772
allowing the other schools to share in the 
permanent university fund. Of course, this is

36:33.753 --> 36:39.522
something A&M had no control over since it is a part 
of the Texas Constitution. Second, we found that

36:40.177 --> 36:58.103
the schools were very proprietary in sharing with 
the system a list of their friends that they had

36:40.177 --> 36:58.103
established themselves and did not want to share 
their support groups with the system. The A&M

36:59.365 --> 37:04.733
system as an entity has no alumni, It had to draw 
upon the various alumni from the various

37:05.422 --> 37:12.610
institutions. A program of this sort to be 
successful requires that the people that are

37:14.051 --> 37:29.488
supporting you, are forming the support group, 
must be informed on the issues and how they should

37:14.051 --> 37:29.488
contact their legislators. To accomplish this, 
we went around the state, mainly in areas where we

37:31.291 --> 37:53.372
had colleges and universities that are part of the 
Texas A&M University System, and met with the

37:31.291 --> 37:53.372
support groups and explained to them what they 
could do and how they could be of assistance to us. I

37:55.113 --> 37:58.176
detected that we were only getting token support 
from the leadership on the various campuses. By

38:05.564 --> 38:15.373
the session beginning in 1993, we did have a core 
group of about 800 supporters that were signed up.

38:16.774 --> 38:34.491
And we were able to make some effective use of this 
in contacting legislators and letting them know

38:16.774 --> 38:34.491
of these people supporting higher education and 
Texas A&M University System in particular. In one

38:35.872 --> 39:04.697
particular case, very late in the regular session 
of 1993, the chairman of the Senate Finance

38:35.872 --> 39:04.697
Committee called several of us to his office, and 
several of us being some of the people in Austin

38:35.872 --> 39:04.697
that worked with higher education institutions, 
and indicated to us that it was very important that

38:35.872 --> 39:04.697
the public school finance bill pass in the House. 
Otherwise, the appropriations bill would have to

39:04.677 --> 39:18.031
be reopened and monies diverted from higher 
education to the public school finance bill. This

39:19.232 --> 39:27.761
was a direct threat to higher education 
appropriations, which had been pretty well

39:19.232 --> 39:27.761
buttoned down by then. So I immediately contacted 
our statewide chairman, of our grassroots

39:34.698 --> 40:00.092
program and he went out of communications to the 
leaders of the Tammis Life program asking them to

39:34.698 --> 40:00.092
contact their house members and assist in getting 
the public school finance bill passed. I always

40:02.035 --> 40:03.557
hope that the people in the support group 
understand why it's necessary to support

40:05.208 --> 40:21.568
something like public school finance at such a 
time without saying that you had been threatened.

40:22.349 --> 40:34.084
But it was effective and we were able to let the 
leadership know that in the legislature

40:37.793 --> 40:49.164
was that we had taken such action and I'm sure that 
it was a very critical issue to them and I'm sure

40:37.793 --> 40:49.164
they appreciated our support. Getting public 
school finance passed during the regular

40:50.785 --> 40:55.690
session. There was one other piece of legislation 
that was introduced by a legislator from Lubbock

40:56.911 --> 41:06.940
that would have dismantle the permanent 
university fund. I did not see this as an immediate

41:13.189 --> 41:34.294
threat to the permanent university fund because 
of the interrelationships and the fact that the

41:13.189 --> 41:34.294
legislator was a first term member and just had not 
recognized how much support could be generated

41:35.371 --> 41:42.924
for the permanent university fund if it became 
necessary. I did expect him to get a hearing on his

41:44.247 --> 41:56.468
bill because the chairman of the House 
Appropriations Committee was a graduate and a

41:44.247 --> 41:56.468
strong supporter of Texas Tech. I suggested to our 
people that we not get too exercised over the bill

41:58.810 --> 42:13.050
at its initial stages, but the University of Texas 
system took a different approach. They were very

42:15.373 --> 42:20.700
active in trying to get the bill killed very early.

42:23.330 --> 42:48.730
This led to them being lectured to by the 
Chairman's House Appropriations Committee that

42:23.330 --> 42:48.730
they had violated a provision in the 
appropriations bill which prohibits

42:23.330 --> 42:48.730
that work for an institution or state agency from

42:23.330 --> 42:48.730
lobbying for or against legislation. It is a very 
fine line, but there is a difference in going to

42:50.296 --> 43:03.368
someone and asking him to vote against the bill and 
going to him and explaining the impact of the

42:50.296 --> 43:03.368
legislation. On the very last day of that 
legislation, I was informed that I was no longer

43:04.909 --> 43:19.442
Executive Secretary of the Board of Regents and 
was being reassigned as Director of Public

43:04.909 --> 43:19.442
Policy.

43:22.730 --> 43:28.379
This was described to me as a lateral move, but 
obviously it was not. The position of director is

43:30.262 --> 43:38.095
not as elevated as the position of vice 
chancellor.

43:41.220 --> 43:45.126
I was never advised as to why this change was made. 
And it would serve no useful purpose for me to

43:46.321 --> 43:57.799
speculate as to why the position change was made 
and why the position of Director of Public Policy

43:46.321 --> 43:57.799
was even created. It was very difficult and trying 
because for one thing, we were changing

43:59.422 --> 44:07.354
chancellors about every year. There were 12 
months during that period of time. In the summer of

44:13.287 --> 44:35.735
1994, approximately one year later, the 
chancellor was reassigned, and at that time, the

44:13.287 --> 44:35.735
system vice chancellor and general counsel was 
moved to Austin and reassigned as vice chancellor

44:13.287 --> 44:35.735
for state affairs. Shortly thereafter, I started 
spending two days in Austin when during the

44:43.780 --> 44:58.281
interim when the legislature was not in session to 
be in touch with the new vice chancellor for state

44:43.780 --> 44:58.281
affairs and to have secretarial support. By the 
time the legislature convened in January 1995

44:59.964 --> 45:08.877
another new chancellor had been named and A new 
person was brought in to serve as chief for

45:11.489 --> 45:17.916
legislative affairs. This was an unfilled 
position that had been on the books for some time.

45:26.426 --> 45:32.793
In the 1995 legislative session, I spent as much 
time in Austin as I had in the past. That is three or

45:33.554 --> 45:37.018
four days a week during the time they're in 
session. And even more than that, toward the end of

45:37.939 --> 45:40.382
the session, able to accomplish a great deal 
during that session, just being the eyes and ears

45:42.303 --> 45:50.291
of the system. Members of the legislature 
continued to call upon me and seek my advice on

45:50.311 --> 46:00.200
various issues. At one point in time during the 
session, the chairman of the, the dean of the

46:01.982 --> 46:08.428
Senate,

46:11.311 --> 46:25.064
called me in to work on legislation that would 
create a medical branch in Corpus Christi, part of

46:11.311 --> 46:25.064
the Texas A&M University Medical School. The 
legislation did not get very far through the

46:25.084 --> 46:40.018
process, but I was able to provide a supportive 
role to this influential member of the Texas

46:25.084 --> 46:40.018
Senate. In the 1993 regular session of the Texas 
legislature, a bill was filed that would transfer

46:41.011 --> 46:56.834
Texas A&M International University in Laredo 
from the Texas A&M University system to the

46:41.011 --> 46:56.834
University of Texas system. This was not in the 
best interest of the Texas A&M University system

46:58.136 --> 47:09.212
and would have created a negative image on the part 
of Texas A&M University and the Texas A&M

47:09.783 --> 47:12.690
University system. It passed easily in the Texas 
Senate with the support of the Lieutenant

47:14.193 --> 47:27.623
Governor and to the House of Representatives was 
referred to the House Higher Education Committee

47:14.193 --> 47:27.623
for a hearing.
