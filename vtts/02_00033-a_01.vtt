00:02.461 --> 00:09.099
It is August 7, year 2000, testing, testing, testing one.

00:12.308 --> 00:17.702
Testing the other mic, testing the other mic, testing the other mic.

00:19.893 --> 00:21.114
Okay.

00:21.134 --> 00:38.494
This is August 7, 2000, seated in the Heritage Preservation Program offices, and I have the honor and pleasure to chat with Dr. Vaughn M. Bryant, Jr., the chairman, or is the title head?

00:38.914 --> 00:39.535
Was head.

00:39.956 --> 00:40.917
Was head.

00:41.057 --> 00:42.138
Oh, you're not head anymore?

00:42.378 --> 00:42.438
No.

00:42.458 --> 00:43.960
Of the Department of Anthropology.

00:44.497 --> 00:51.722
To begin with, because a stranger might listen to this or read the tape, read the transcription,

00:51.955 --> 01:01.847
Describe your family background, mom and dad, and where you grew up and where you went to school before you started having the opportunity to be an Aggie.

01:02.268 --> 01:02.528
Sure.

01:03.029 --> 01:04.671
I was born in Dallas, Texas.

01:04.811 --> 01:10.959
My father at the time was working as a reporter for the Dallas Morning News.

01:12.120 --> 01:17.727
And about six months after I was born, he was offered an opportunity to

01:17.707 --> 01:31.039
teach Spanish in an English university in Panama City, Panama, in the Canal Zone.

01:31.299 --> 01:32.580
Well, I guess it was in the Canal Zone.

01:32.600 --> 01:36.404
So we moved to the Canal Zone six months after I was born.

01:36.424 --> 01:40.728
I was born in October of 1940, so that would have been early 1941.

01:42.109 --> 01:46.853
And we lived in the Canal Zone for a couple years, and I remember hearing my father

01:47.187 --> 01:50.431
My mother would tell me the stories of when Pearl Harbor was bombed.

01:51.472 --> 02:09.533
Everybody in the Canal Zone panicked because the biggest thing they had was a couple of machine guns, and they suspected that the Japanese fleet would sail on from Hawaii over to the Canal Zone and try to seal the canal so that it could no longer be used.

02:09.952 --> 02:16.981
They were already starting blackouts and things like that, but fortunately nothing ever happened.

02:17.001 --> 02:34.963
Shortly after that, in 1942, my father quit working for the university there in the Canal Zone and became a war correspondent for the Associated Press.

02:35.433 --> 02:37.496
And they sent him to South America.

02:38.138 --> 02:44.308
And in the next five to six years, we lived in every capital in South America.

02:45.831 --> 02:47.674
Never more than a few months, it seemed like.

02:48.355 --> 03:00.816
We lived in Rio, and we lived in La Paz, and we lived in Santiago, Chile, and Buenos Aires, and all of the big capitals down there.

03:00.796 --> 03:02.899
I don't have a whole lot of memories of that.

03:03.059 --> 03:10.350
There are a couple of them that stand out, and that is that when we were living in Paraguay, or was it Uruguay?

03:10.390 --> 03:11.312
I'm not sure which one.

03:11.832 --> 03:25.032
Anyway, one day we took an excursion boat out into the ocean, and we got a chance to see the Grouse Bay, which had been sunk, scuttled,

03:25.012 --> 03:33.020
As you remember, it went into Montevideo and was cornered and decided to go out and scuttle itself a few miles offshore.

03:33.140 --> 03:42.069
And I remember this tour boat going out, you know, passengers, and we went around this blackened superstructure.

03:42.129 --> 03:44.851
That's all that was above water, but there was still quite a bit above water.

03:44.911 --> 03:50.817
And I remember that vividly, and I didn't understand what it was, but it seemed to be an important thing.

03:51.320 --> 04:02.535
My other recollection was going over the Andes in a train on my birthday, October 5th, in 1946.

04:04.498 --> 04:19.639
And I remember seeing as we were going over the Andes, up in the very top of the Andes, from Buenos Aires to Santiago, that's the way they used to drive the cattle herds from Argentina over to Chile, and they would drive them over in the summertime.

04:21.205 --> 04:33.097
Anyway, a lot of the cattle didn't make it and so they would die on the side of the railway track and of course that was the main cut through the mountain so they would run them through the railway.

04:33.117 --> 04:37.408
So I remember seeing numerous carcasses of frozen cattle

04:37.878 --> 04:39.563
as we were crossing the Andes.

04:40.044 --> 04:49.570
Anyway, so then, well, the one other thing I remember was living in Rio.

04:49.731 --> 04:53.541
We lived in Rio de Janeiro for a while, and my brother was born there.

04:53.521 --> 04:54.804
1945.

04:55.225 --> 05:08.497
And we lived at 777 Copacabana, which was a high-rise building right on Copacabana Beach, which today would probably cost you an arm and a leg.

05:08.998 --> 05:11.985
Back then it was rather inexpensive property.

05:12.370 --> 05:14.834
Living in Rio at that time was interesting.

05:14.874 --> 05:20.784
I remember going to Sugarloaf Mountain and up to see the big statue of Christ and some of the other things like that.

05:20.804 --> 05:22.066
So it was a fun time.

05:22.507 --> 05:28.978
And came back to the United States in 1947, late 47.

05:30.595 --> 05:40.988
My father had taken a job with the Port of New Orleans as Director of International Relations, and we lived in New Orleans for a few years.

05:41.008 --> 05:41.548
I don't remember.

05:41.568 --> 05:48.637
In fact, I remember when I lived in New Orleans, the streetcar still went down Canal Street as well as St.

05:48.677 --> 05:49.058
Charles.

05:49.538 --> 05:52.722
You could take the streetcar all the way to the end of Canal.

05:52.702 --> 06:05.654
Anyway, we lived right near Audubon Park for a while, and then eventually built a house out in Metri, which at that time was a boondocks, but now it's almost downtown New Orleans.

06:06.154 --> 06:08.937
That's M-E-T-A-I-R-I-E.

06:08.957 --> 06:09.858
Yeah, Metri.

06:09.878 --> 06:10.579
Metri, yeah.

06:11.059 --> 06:14.882
But anyway, that was very enjoyable.

06:14.923 --> 06:15.643
It was a fun time.

06:16.784 --> 06:21.949
From there, he accepted a job as the head of the Good Neighbor Commission,

06:22.503 --> 06:25.607
working for Governor Alan Shivers in Austin.

06:27.390 --> 06:34.119
And so we moved to Austin, where he then began doing a lot of traveling in Mexico.

06:34.159 --> 06:36.782
And in fact, we got to travel with him some of the time.

06:37.523 --> 06:51.582
One of the better experiences, or the more fun experiences, was we went down to Yucatan and spent several weeks down there and went out to Chichen Itza,

06:52.068 --> 06:53.733
You'll have a good time spelling that one.

06:53.873 --> 07:04.002
But anyway, Chichen Itza, which is a large archaeological site that the Mexicans had just restored, and they were opening a big hotel called Maya Land.

07:04.454 --> 07:10.205
And we were there for the inauguration and opening of this big fancy hotel.

07:10.265 --> 07:14.093
The governor of Mexico was there and a governor of the state of Yucatan.

07:14.133 --> 07:17.239
Anyway, it was a big thing and it was a lot of fun.

07:17.439 --> 07:24.353
Shortly after that, my parents got divorced and my mother...

07:24.333 --> 07:35.370
married an Alaskan and moved to Sterling, Alaska, which is south of Anchorage on the Kenai Peninsula, K-E-N-A-I.

07:37.233 --> 07:40.398
This was back when it was still a state in 1957.

07:41.019 --> 07:43.523
I'm sorry, still a territory in 1957.

07:44.110 --> 07:54.081
And so I moved up along with my brother, my brother and me, moved up to, my brother and I, yeah, right, sorry.

07:54.101 --> 07:59.067
My brother and I moved up to Alaska with my mother.

07:59.387 --> 08:07.536
And we lived on a homestead, which was about four and a half miles from the next neighbor on a gravel road.

08:08.191 --> 08:12.177
in a little town called Sterling, Alaska, which had a population of about 35.

08:12.557 --> 08:19.688
And Kenai, which was the next biggest town, it was a fish cannery, had a population of several hundred.

08:20.128 --> 08:22.592
Today, Kenai has 20,000 people.

08:22.672 --> 08:31.465
But anyway, I remember when we flew to Alaska, the last leg of the flight was in a DC-3.

08:32.103 --> 08:34.587
and we landed on a dirt runway in the mud.

08:35.729 --> 08:41.477
It had steel grading on it, much like they did overseas during the war, but that was it.

08:41.658 --> 08:46.986
It was a dirt runway with steel grading, and they didn't even have a conning tower.

08:47.066 --> 08:52.474
It was just a little shack, and I guess they just flew in by visual sighting or something.

08:53.146 --> 09:00.795
We lived in Alaska for a couple years, and then I came back to Texas to go to high school.

09:00.896 --> 09:09.907
My father had remarried, moved to Houston, where he had gotten a job again with the Port of Houston as Director of International Relations.

09:10.307 --> 09:13.771
So we moved to Houston and went to high school there.

09:14.272 --> 09:15.594
Which high school?

09:15.614 --> 09:18.938
I went to San Jacinto High School, which is now a tech college.

09:19.098 --> 09:19.879
In fact,

09:20.787 --> 09:23.151
I was on the football team and it was interesting.

09:23.211 --> 09:27.477
I played two years of football and my younger brother played two years of football.

09:28.559 --> 09:32.805
And between us we played four consecutive years during which we never won a game.

09:34.007 --> 09:41.378
At one time we held the 5A high school record for consecutive losses in the state of Texas.

09:41.763 --> 09:55.576
Anyway, part of the problem was that San Jacinto High School was very close to, well, it was close to, it wasn't close to Meyerland, but it was close to Old Spanish Trail.

09:55.996 --> 09:59.159
And there were a lot of Jewish people that lived in that area.

09:59.680 --> 10:04.184
And in fact, the high school was sometimes called Sheeney High.

10:05.005 --> 10:09.289
And the reason being is that the vast majority of students there were Jewish.

10:09.775 --> 10:14.563
Nothing against the Jews, but they didn't particularly care to play football.

10:14.623 --> 10:18.749
Most of them excelled in basketball, track, and other sports.

10:18.769 --> 10:23.657
But for some reason, there weren't, as far as I can remember, a single Jew on the football team.

10:23.677 --> 10:27.663
And so the football team consisted mainly of Gentiles.

10:27.743 --> 10:32.070
Of course, there were no other minorities, no blacks or anything like that in school at that time.

10:32.793 --> 10:45.933
So at times when we would go play football, we would never have more than 19 people even suit up, which is not even a complete double squad.

10:45.973 --> 10:49.759
In other words, most of us played offense and defense.

10:49.779 --> 10:58.632
And I remember our coach was named Coach Phillips, and one of his famous expressions at halftime was,

10:58.898 --> 11:06.031
When he'd get us all together, his pep talk would always end with, okay, boys, go back out there and let's see if we can hold the score down.

11:07.614 --> 11:14.907
Because some of the scores against us were astronomical, 40s and 50s and 60s to nothing or to three or six points.

11:14.947 --> 11:15.388
But anyway.

11:15.807 --> 11:26.100
All right, so after high school, I also swam in high school, and we did a little better in swimming, and there were Jews on the swimming team.

11:26.120 --> 11:32.708
But anyway, then went to the University of Texas, where I began majoring in geology first.

11:33.108 --> 11:34.310
No, actually, it was journalism.

11:34.410 --> 11:44.903
I decided I was going to be a journalist, and I enjoyed journalism, except I found out that I had to write stories about things I wasn't particularly interested in, and I didn't want to do that, so I got out of journalism.

11:45.288 --> 11:49.712
and then got into geography and got my bachelor's degree in geography.

11:51.214 --> 11:55.158
While I was doing geography, I learned to make maps and became a cartographer.

11:55.418 --> 12:04.427
And this is when I started working for the University of Texas Press as their primary cartographer, drawing maps and illustrations for their books.

12:04.547 --> 12:05.808
This was under Frank Wardlaw.

12:06.970 --> 12:13.316
And then as I entered my graduate work, I went into anthropology.

12:13.416 --> 12:14.417
Why?

12:14.667 --> 12:23.530
The anthropology department offered me a fellowship or a teaching assistantship if I would draw maps of archaeological sites for them.

12:23.965 --> 12:27.852
which they couldn't seem to do very well, which was rather easy for me.

12:27.973 --> 12:38.492
So that's how I got into anthropology, and I ended up getting a master's degree in anthropology, continuing to work for Frank Woodlaw at the press.

12:38.713 --> 12:46.227
In fact, I was chief illustrator and mapmaker for, oh, I don't know, it seemed like about six years or so.

12:46.882 --> 12:48.244
Let's sidetrack a second.

12:48.324 --> 12:54.832
Describe Frank Wardlaw as you recall him at that time, since he would end up here as our press director.

12:55.933 --> 13:12.893
Well, I didn't have a whole lot of contact directly with Frank Wardlaw, although I remember him as being, he seemed big to me, big and impressive, and a very, you know, very nice, congenial sort of person.

13:12.993 --> 13:15.977
I mean, my brief meetings with him

13:16.312 --> 13:26.344
were very congenial and very nice, and I got to be, you know, fairly good friends, although most of my work was with some of the editors.

13:27.025 --> 13:31.190
It was Dr. Wardlaw, Mr. Wardlaw, whatever.

13:32.211 --> 13:34.934
Frank Wardlaw very rarely ever interceded in these things.

13:34.994 --> 13:40.060
Just once in a while I would see him at social functions that were held at the university press or something like that.

13:40.180 --> 13:41.922
And remember, I was just a graduate student.

13:41.982 --> 13:45.266
I was not, you know, big shot, so.

13:45.286 --> 13:45.947
Then PhD where?

13:46.670 --> 13:50.255
Well, after this, you'll love this story, too.

13:50.756 --> 14:14.770
After I got my master's degree in anthropology, and while I was in anthropology, my last year in anthropology, or actually, I guess it was shortly after I entered anthropology, an archaeologist at the University of Texas by the name of Ed Jelks got one of the first

14:15.408 --> 14:20.195
what we would call a paleo-environmental NSF grant.

14:20.576 --> 14:41.348
He and several colleagues got a grant to do the paleo-ecology of the Amnistad Reservoir, which was just being built at this time south of Del Rio, or actually a little north of Del Rio, and backs up along the Rio Grande and Pecos Rivers.

14:41.885 --> 14:47.012
And so they had been doing cultural resource salvage work out there.

14:47.052 --> 14:49.194
In fact, they'd worked there in the WPA days as well.

14:49.975 --> 14:57.024
But this was an NSF grant to go out and try to do an in-depth study into a number of different aspects.

14:57.185 --> 14:59.287
They wanted to look at the ecology.

14:59.327 --> 15:01.731
They wanted to look at the plant remains.

15:01.751 --> 15:07.538
They wanted to look at the animal remains, perhaps even diet reconstructions and whatever.

15:08.598 --> 15:13.789
So they had this money in the department and they didn't have anybody, they didn't have any gophers.

15:13.889 --> 15:15.593
They needed some graduate student gophers.

15:17.497 --> 15:23.350
My understanding is that they offered the job to several graduate students who turned them down.

15:24.747 --> 15:38.664
And eventually they asked me, they called me in one day, and they said, well, we need a student to be a gopher, and we need somebody primarily to assist with the palynology.

15:39.966 --> 15:42.970
And we wanted to know whether or not you would be interested in doing this.

15:42.990 --> 15:45.212
And I said, well, you know, what does it pay?

15:45.252 --> 15:46.754
And they said $300 a month.

15:46.854 --> 15:49.918
And they said this would be a two-year job.

15:49.938 --> 15:52.601
And I said, well, of course, I would be more than happy to do that.

15:52.862 --> 15:53.843
Now this is what year?

15:54.413 --> 15:55.674
This would be about 1966.

15:55.694 --> 15:56.335
No, 1965.

15:56.455 --> 16:01.981
Yeah, 1965.

16:02.121 --> 16:05.825
I said, I'd be more than happy to do this.

16:06.245 --> 16:11.911
So I then went out and got a dictionary and tried to find out what palynology meant.

16:11.931 --> 16:13.252
I had no idea what it meant.

16:13.372 --> 16:14.934
I'd never heard of the word.

16:14.954 --> 16:16.576
It turned out it was pollen studies.

16:17.256 --> 16:18.778
So that's what happened.

16:18.798 --> 16:20.860
For the next couple of years, I assisted.

16:21.228 --> 16:39.338
palynologists who were hired by this grant from other universities like John McAndrews who was from up in Canada and they hired Dick Heavily from Arizona, H-E-V-L-Y.

16:40.111 --> 16:50.387
But anyway, and so my job was to assist them and of course there were some very interesting, I learned a lot.

16:51.308 --> 17:06.912
I had a background in anthropology and the reason that they selected me I found out and asked me if I wanted is because they were looking through my transcript and noticed that I'd taken two courses in plant geography and so they figured I must know something about plants.

17:08.731 --> 17:35.802
One of the things I learned as this gopher was that anthropologists and botanists very rarely knew how to communicate with each other because I remember I was in my role as gopher, was escorting a palynologist, a botanist from Arizona State University out to the Omnistab Reservoir around Langtree

17:36.473 --> 17:52.947
And the archaeologist who was working on this big site out there by the name of Dick Ross, anyway, the two, three of us actually, were walking across the barren landscape out in that area right along the Rio Grande.

17:53.585 --> 18:07.145
And I remember Dick Hevely, the botanist, looked down at a small bush that was not much higher than your knee, and he said, my God, I've never seen a Quercus virginiana that small.

18:08.266 --> 18:12.332
And the archaeologist looked at it and said, hell, I thought that was an oak.

18:14.175 --> 18:20.925
And that, to me, expressed the problem that existed at that time, as the botanist and the anthropologist never talked to each other.

18:21.192 --> 18:43.453
And in fact, my later job was to clean up a lot of the writing that became part of the final report of this big NSF grant because the botanists wrote with no understanding of archaeology and the archaeologists wrote with no understanding of botany and I tried to, I was, you know, part of my job was to edit this stuff and to try to make it all compatible.

18:44.598 --> 18:54.471
In the process, I began to see that, to me, what seemed like an interesting thing to pursue would be to try to do botanical work within the field of archaeology.

18:56.855 --> 19:04.665
But with a background in archaeology, I felt that I would be more of an asset than somebody who was just strictly a botanist.

19:05.406 --> 19:14.098
So I, after getting my master's in anthropology, left and joined the botany department for a PhD, still at the University of Texas.

19:14.804 --> 19:17.416
and ended up getting my PhD in botany.

19:18.440 --> 19:19.043
Why botany?

19:19.124 --> 19:21.675
Because I figured that if I was going to be

19:21.875 --> 19:23.116
looking at plant materials.

19:23.217 --> 19:28.523
I would need the kind of in-depth training you would get by doing a doctoral study in botany.

19:28.843 --> 19:33.669
And I didn't think I could get that kind of information in anthropology.

19:33.689 --> 19:38.835
So I ended up with three degrees, one in geography, one in anthropology, and one in botany.

19:40.737 --> 19:42.900
This was 1969 when I finished.

19:43.100 --> 19:46.644
I had six job offers, and it wasn't that I was the most outstanding graduate.

19:46.704 --> 19:50.008
It's just in 1969, jobs were plentiful.

19:51.338 --> 20:04.447
And of the six job offers, I finally decided on one at Washington State University, mainly because I had seen all these Sierra Club posters of how beautiful the state of Washington was, the beautiful coniferous forest.

20:04.487 --> 20:08.757
And of course, coming from Texas, it was rather flat and dry.

20:09.158 --> 20:16.648
So we went up to Washington State University in Pullman, but I discovered that Pullman is not in the middle of the Cascade Mountains.

20:16.768 --> 20:23.517
Pullman is in a barren area that looks much like El Paso.

20:23.538 --> 20:29.626
Anyway, Pullman is noted for its wheat, and it's a big wheat belt area.

20:31.608 --> 20:37.917
The university at Pullman, they had a fairly good-sized anthropology department,

20:37.897 --> 20:43.857
and they were beginning to try to build something that they called the Quaternary Option.

20:44.579 --> 21:08.629
which was an attempt to train archaeologists in a little bit of faunal analysis, a little bit of plant analysis, a little bit of ecology, a little bit of bone analysis, a little bit of soil analysis, so that when they go out and looked at sites, they would know more than just looking at the sherds and flint chips and stuff like this.

21:09.470 --> 21:11.453
and I was hired to do the botanical part.

21:11.473 --> 21:17.661
They had hired somebody else to do the faunal part and somebody else to do the geology and so forth.

21:18.602 --> 21:31.258
But when I got there, I found out, and this was something, you know, I had my PhD in hand, but when I got there, or actually when they had hired me, which was earlier while I was still finishing up my PhD,

21:31.627 --> 21:41.558
They made it very clear in the letter that it really didn't make any difference whether I finished immediately or not, that I could have a few more years if I needed it, and not that I wanted to hesitate and do it.

21:41.939 --> 21:45.343
Although there was an interesting point.

21:45.843 --> 21:55.474
I got a call from Ralph Selecki, who was then chairman of the anthropology department at the University of Columbia, who in fact had also offered me a job at Columbia University.

21:56.315 --> 22:05.873
asked me if I would go to Lebanon with him and spend the summer doing the ethnobotanical remains from a large Neolithic site, which would have been a wonderful opportunity.

22:06.655 --> 22:09.200
But I was writing my dissertation, and I turned him down.

22:09.580 --> 22:10.442
I hated to do that.

22:10.979 --> 22:12.963
But in retrospect, it was a wise decision.

22:13.524 --> 22:15.829
So anyway.

22:17.031 --> 22:21.480
But when I got to Washington State University, seven of the 12 faculty members didn't have PhDs.

22:21.661 --> 22:24.647
They were all working on them, but they didn't have them.

22:25.288 --> 22:29.497
And Washington State had some other problems.

22:29.797 --> 22:32.042
The main problem was, shortly after I arrived,

22:32.022 --> 22:41.522
The supersonic transport was something that the United States government had been interested in funding.

22:41.743 --> 22:46.032
It was sort of like, well, the Concorde was the one thing that remains of it.

22:46.315 --> 22:49.439
But the United States at one time was going to build a whole fleet of these things.

22:49.559 --> 22:53.704
And so it was funded through Boeing and, of course, Seattle.

22:55.125 --> 23:07.480
And when the federal government yanked the B-1, or not the B-1, but when they yanked the supersonic transport funding, the whole state of Washington went into almost deprivation.

23:07.460 --> 23:09.462
The university got its budget cuts.

23:09.863 --> 23:10.844
There weren't any raises.

23:10.884 --> 23:12.225
There was no money for travel.

23:12.306 --> 23:17.311
In fact, you even had to get permission from the department chairman to even make a long-distance phone call.

23:18.192 --> 23:19.974
And so times were grim.

23:20.575 --> 23:36.994
Anyway, the main problem I had in living in Washington was not necessarily the budget cuts or anything, but coming from Texas with 200 or 350 days of sunshine,

23:37.362 --> 23:43.370
and going to Pullman, Washington, where in September it's clouds over and you don't see the sun again until May.

23:43.891 --> 23:47.816
In fact, I remember counting 21 consecutive days in which you could not see the sun.

23:48.857 --> 23:55.006
And it drizzled every day almost, or it rained, or occasionally it snowed.

23:55.486 --> 24:00.133
And in the wintertime it would snow in the morning early before sunrise.

24:00.253 --> 24:01.975
By noon it would melt into slush.

24:02.055 --> 24:03.557
By afternoon it would freeze again.

24:03.657 --> 24:05.580
So all the roads were always icy.

24:06.995 --> 24:10.913
So I decided that it was time to bail out of Washington State.

24:12.158 --> 24:13.866
And this is where the interesting part comes in.

24:15.230 --> 24:23.201
In 1968, of course, Texas A&M had decided to build a College of Liberal Arts, and they approved this.

24:23.261 --> 24:39.725
They had hired David Maxwell to come over from Tulane to be the first dean of liberal arts, and in his or the university's projection, they had created the Department of Sociology and Anthropology, but they had nobody in anthropology.

24:39.885 --> 24:40.947
All they had was sociology.

24:41.768 --> 24:44.832
And the first head was Robert Skorbonik,

24:45.537 --> 24:47.322
who had come out of rural sociology.

24:47.342 --> 24:50.612
Anyway, that's sort of a little background.

24:50.632 --> 24:58.416
So in 1970, I began writing letters to some friends of mine, not a whole lot of friends,

24:58.733 --> 25:00.154
Not a whole lot of people.

25:01.155 --> 25:05.720
And the main thing, since I was a botanist, I wasn't really looking for a job in anthropology.

25:05.760 --> 25:07.061
I was looking for a job in botany.

25:07.181 --> 25:09.344
And so I was writing botany departments.

25:09.364 --> 25:15.630
And one of the people I wrote was a good friend of mine named Bill Elsick, who worked for Exxon.

25:15.710 --> 25:25.099
He was a palynologist that worked for Exxon down in Houston, which at that time, was it Exxon or was it, I don't know, but anyway, Humble.

25:25.139 --> 25:26.901
I think he worked for Humble Oil at that time.

25:27.472 --> 25:38.869
Anyway, he worked in Houston, and I had gotten to know Bill because I was a member of the American Association of Stratigraphic Palynologists and was keeping fairly good track of other palynologists.

25:40.873 --> 25:46.681
I wrote Bill and said, hey, Bill, is there any chance of an opening in the oil industry?

25:47.683 --> 25:50.948
Oil was booming at this time, and they were looking for a lot of people.

25:51.367 --> 25:56.654
to do palynology because palynology is useful in oil exploration.

25:56.674 --> 25:59.057
So I was really asking Bill if he knew of a job.

26:00.559 --> 26:04.684
Turns out that Bill's wife is Bob Skarbonik's first cousin.

26:06.066 --> 26:09.630
And they all go back to snook very frequently.

26:10.711 --> 26:17.560
And one day while eating kolaches at some snook eatery,

26:17.843 --> 26:24.152
Bob happened to mention to Bill, he said, I have just been given a terrible burden.

26:24.893 --> 26:30.841
He said, the dean has asked me to go find an anthropologist, and I don't have the foggiest idea of where to look.

26:32.003 --> 26:39.754
And Bill Elsick said, well, I know of a guy up in Washington State who's in an anthropology department who's looking for a job.

26:40.135 --> 26:42.858
And so Bob Skobanik said, well, give me his name.

26:43.559 --> 26:44.020
Okay.

26:44.371 --> 26:53.360
Well, sure enough, Bob Scribani called me in Washington State and asked me if I would help them find an anthropologist.

26:53.400 --> 27:01.088
Well, of course, I could see between the lines that it was really more of an invitation to apply myself.

27:03.751 --> 27:10.918
I'm a little ahead of the story, though, because I had also written, at the same time I had written Bill Elsick, I had also written my good friend George Carter.

27:11.438 --> 27:17.280
who I had known at the University of Texas, because he had come to Texas when I was a graduate student there,

27:17.699 --> 27:25.650
to give a talk, and he had given a talk on his dissertation, which was really the ethnobotany of the American Southwest.

27:25.670 --> 27:26.772
It's still a classic work.

27:27.993 --> 27:46.018
And he was very much interested, because at the time I was studying pollen, and he was very much convinced that corn had made a transatlantic migration via dispersion, boats of people carrying it,

27:46.133 --> 27:48.195
over to Africa before Columbus.

27:48.956 --> 27:57.044
And so he was convinced that in East Africa, or West Africa actually, that they'd been growing corn prior to Columbus's voyage.

27:57.905 --> 28:03.711
And he had gotten some samples from Nigeria, and he wanted somebody to look at them to see if there was corn pollen.

28:03.791 --> 28:08.136
Well, I volunteered to look for them, and there wasn't any corn pollen in there.

28:08.176 --> 28:11.179
But anyway, that's how I got to know George Carter.

28:11.497 --> 28:17.566
Anyway, I had also written George Carter, who at that time was here at Texas A&M in Geography Department.

28:18.207 --> 28:37.858
Well, George Carter immediately got together with Ed Duran, who was the Department of Geography, and together they sent me a letter inviting me down to Texas A&M to interview for a job as a cartographer, as a mapmaker, to teach mapmaking in geography.

28:38.429 --> 28:45.476
using my training for my undergraduate degree and my experiences as a mapmaker during my graduate work.

28:47.038 --> 28:50.021
So I really came to Texas A&M at their invitation.

28:50.482 --> 28:55.807
They footed the bill for me to be interviewed here to get a job in geography.

28:55.847 --> 29:01.874
But while I was here, since Schubanek had been writing me, I told Bob that I would drop by and say hello.

29:02.154 --> 29:04.116
So I did.

29:04.670 --> 29:09.998
I went by and talked to Bob Skribanek, gave him a copy of my resume, and it sounded very interesting.

29:10.398 --> 29:17.789
And while I was here, and this was in the early days of A&M, I remember that I also got an opportunity to visit with Dean Maxwell.

29:18.991 --> 29:23.277
And then I also saw Jack Williams for 30 minutes.

29:23.398 --> 29:28.205
I thought that was really impressive that the president of the university would have 30 minutes to talk to me.

29:29.567 --> 29:33.192
And of course, when I had talked to Bob Skribanek, I had laid out some

29:33.509 --> 29:58.403
ideas that i had about how they could build an anthropology department and the more i got to talking to him and to dave maxwell and jack williams the more it began to sound like that might be a better way to go than geography the other thing that kind of squirreled my my position in geography was i remember sitting in ed duran's office looking at him and he asked he said if you had to sum up

29:59.176 --> 30:03.561
If you had to sum yourself up in one word, what would you call yourself?

30:04.302 --> 30:05.083
I knew what he wanted.

30:05.123 --> 30:06.905
He wanted me to say, I'm a geographer.

30:06.925 --> 30:09.147
And I said, I'm a palynologist.

30:09.167 --> 30:10.108
That was the wrong answer.

30:10.729 --> 30:16.235
Anyway, they actually did offer me a job in geography, and they offered me a job in anthropology.

30:16.676 --> 30:21.562
And it was really the same pay, so it was really no advantage of one or the other.

30:21.642 --> 30:28.069
But I decided to take my chances with the anthropology one rather than geography because

30:28.943 --> 30:30.369
I saw it as an opportunity.

30:30.429 --> 30:34.547
Now, at the time, Dave Maxwell had told me, he said, well, here's the deal.

30:34.949 --> 30:38.363
He said, we don't know whether anthropology is going to go here on this campus or not.

30:39.018 --> 30:44.585
We'll hire you, and even if it doesn't go, we'll keep you as our token anthropologist.

30:44.605 --> 30:56.519
You know, we're not going to fire you, but if it really takes off, then we will begin to add more money to anthropology, and hopefully someday it will become a, you know, a booming discipline.

30:57.219 --> 31:01.544
In fact, he said, we would love to see it become a separate department within 20 years.

31:02.085 --> 31:07.071
So anyway, that was a calling, and so that's how I got here.

31:07.632 --> 31:08.873
What year did you arrive?

31:09.308 --> 31:15.266
I came here in the summer of 1971, in August.

31:15.387 --> 31:20.382
I started August 1st, 1971, and at the time we had bought a house.
