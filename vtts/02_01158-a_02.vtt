WEBVTT

00:02.377 --> 00:07.844
So anyway, then when we got our health center 
built, a big part of my practice was the zoo. I'd go

00:07.864 --> 00:12.150
there every day for two or three or four hours, 
whatever necessitated. And then still I had a

00:12.170 --> 00:15.995
large animal practice, equine practice. And then 
I recommended that they get a full-time

00:16.015 --> 00:28.232
veterinarian at the zoo, and I did not want it 
because I had a pretty good equine practice, and

00:16.015 --> 00:28.232
I've got a couple of farms, and I kind of like to do 
different things. so then they hired a couple of

00:28.803 --> 00:56.734
full-time and one of them so they didn't do they 
didn't get they did yeah yeah and i do work i go there

00:28.803 --> 00:56.734
once a while when they somebody's out of town dr 
fletcher's there now he's in there all the people

00:28.803 --> 00:56.734
that i know didn't zoo worker in there and uh so 
present time and we have tom mitch and aazv About

00:57.355 --> 01:02.080
the time I started zoo work, the American 
Association of Zoo Veterinarians was just

00:57.355 --> 01:02.080
started. And we had no literature, we had no books, 
we had no normals. I think the first meeting I went

01:06.966 --> 01:11.451
to was... Michigan State. I guess it was... It was 
the only one they had. Yeah, I guess that was back

01:13.494 --> 01:19.060
about 19... had to be about 1960. 59, 60, 61. No, 
about 60, 61, 62. It was in the early 60s when they

01:24.243 --> 01:27.409
had a few meetings. Yeah, and there were only, I 
think there were 15. I went to Michigan State, when

01:30.694 --> 01:36.224
Tom and I went, and I started going to them, we went 
to Michigan State, the Kellogg Center. There was

01:36.685 --> 01:43.697
15 or 18 veterinarians there, and they met once a 
year, and we still had very little information

01:43.981 --> 02:08.233
knowledge books literature so then it now it is i go 
every year went to hawaii and went to australia

01:43.981 --> 02:08.233
last year and the avian society a avian 
association met with a zoo vendor in hawaii year

01:43.981 --> 02:08.233
before last and now there's international 
organizations there are thousands of members and

01:43.981 --> 02:08.233
we have books that we have some gentlemen that are 
really specialists at it, Dr. Murray Fowler in

02:08.585 --> 02:16.499
Davis, California, and some other people. And we 
have a lot of things, Tom. Really, a lot of

02:18.583 --> 02:20.927
information. In fact, I tell people that in that 
field, and I think just what Stubby's saying, that

02:21.007 --> 02:32.888
the last about probably five to six or seven years, 
I've been on the greatest learning curve of my

02:33.087 --> 02:41.799
career in these species because the 
information's being disseminated and published

02:33.087 --> 02:41.799
and flowing. And I've learned more medical, 
gained more medical knowledge in those species in

02:41.819 --> 02:51.292
the last five or six years than the other 20 years 
put together. You know, because we were just down

02:51.332 --> 02:55.839
here stumbling along, trying to do the best we 
could. And nobody to talk to or share information.

02:58.442 --> 03:00.445
Colleges have some people. They had one man 
several years ago, a very good friend of mine,

03:01.032 --> 03:03.756
died. I was a pulper. Dr. Dean Brown was the only 
exotic teacher at A&M. They only had one course.

03:10.025 --> 03:12.770
Now they have a couple of men, and they're going to 
have to expand. They're going to have to expand.

03:14.272 --> 03:20.441
The demand I want to get into, I want to bring this up 
because it is important. I went to Australia the

03:20.862 --> 03:23.926
year before last to wildlife it. And there are only 
two of us in the United States that are exotic

03:23.946 --> 03:30.516
veterinarians, wildlife. Over there, for 
example, in Texas now, exotic medicine, there's

03:30.935 --> 03:35.201
ranches. I have ranches from five acres to 
thousands of acres. They have eight-foot fences

03:39.246 --> 03:40.548
around them. I have an article written on that. 
You've got them fenced in now. When their

03:44.914 --> 03:52.785
population increases, if you don't take care of 
them, feed them, supplement them, get rid of the

03:44.914 --> 03:52.785
surplus, you create a monster. And I can tell you 
many things about this. Anyway, it's created a new

03:56.956 --> 04:06.670
business in Texas, exotic medicine, because now 
we have, you can come to Texas and hunt or shoot any

03:56.956 --> 04:06.670
kind of a trophy that's in Africa. There's more 
black buck antelope and axis deer in Texas than

04:08.092 --> 04:13.620
there is in Asia where they originated. I mean, by 
thousands. Is that right? That's interesting. I

04:16.884 --> 04:18.867
know we've got some around College Station. I had a 
friend, a client, Mr. Liu from Taiwan that raised

04:19.047 --> 04:22.733
axis. We shipped three loads. by Flying Tiger 
Airlines to Taiwan. Now he has a ranch in Taiwan.

04:30.437 --> 04:33.601
And when I was in Australia, we stayed on a game farm 
for two nights. They get more for the horns that are

04:34.502 --> 04:43.815
cut off in the velvet that the Taiwanese and some of 
the people think are an aphrodisiac and make you

04:34.502 --> 04:43.815
live forever. They get more for that and they do the 
meat. Now here in Texas, the meat, some of it, but

04:47.120 --> 04:54.570
there's too many hunters in Texas. The thing in 
Texas that it's really doing is trophy hunting,

04:54.854 --> 05:05.327
the big trophy heads of all these axes, greater 
kudu, lesser kudu, sable antelope, you name it.

05:06.068 --> 05:12.236
It's created a complete new thing, and it's 
growing ostriches right now real hot. They were

05:12.256 --> 05:16.261
getting $800 for a little three- or 
four-month-old ostrich. Now, a gentleman told me

05:16.321 --> 05:24.692
the other day they're getting $3,000 to $4,000, 
and he bought a pair of ostrich for $82,000.

05:25.027 --> 05:26.630
five-year-old breeding stock. He has an 
incubator he paid $70,000. And they all think

05:28.933 --> 05:38.549
they're going to get rich, but the very few of them 
are going to make any money. You may not have heard

05:38.569 --> 05:46.703
of him, but Fred Thornberry, who's an A&M in poker 
science, he's been getting a lot of this exotic

05:38.569 --> 05:46.703
bird inquiry. Boy, he says, when they come to me 
with ostriches now, I tell them, you know, Stay out

05:50.727 --> 05:52.008
of it. You're going to lose your shirt. And he said, 
they'll do it anyway. They'll do it anyway. You

05:56.192 --> 05:56.853
can't tell. They have the money and the ostrich 
skin boots and the feathers and something unique.

06:04.701 --> 06:05.481
People have money. They're going to do something 
with it. I'm going to California next month to

06:08.985 --> 06:12.748
visit Murray Fowler. I'll talk to A&M. And they're 
limited. I'm limited. as to the whole ostrich

06:19.195 --> 06:22.259
picture, and I know more than most people. I have 
more experience with them. But we have, you know,

06:24.222 --> 06:38.901
when each phase of each one specific individual 
animal all of a sudden gets popular, then

06:24.222 --> 06:38.901
everybody knows a thing about it, and there's one 
alcohol. It concentrates the problems, too. You

06:40.723 --> 06:42.165
know, some guy can have a one or two ostriches out 
here, or a few of them, and he's raised them, and he

06:42.550 --> 06:46.814
doesn't have any problem. But when you start 
getting 40 or 50 of them, you start having

06:46.835 --> 06:53.842
overcrowding, and your nutritional problems, 
and disease control. Parasite problems. Yeah,

06:55.003 --> 06:57.666
parasite problems, and then it just accentuates. 
I have a little article I wrote about 12 years ago.

07:00.969 --> 07:08.237
When I was doing the zoo work, and I started going to 
ranches, and with the ant ranches in the 70s,

07:00.969 --> 07:08.237
everybody was putting an eight-foot fence around 
them. 50 or 100 or 20 or whatever. And all of a

07:10.901 --> 07:13.786
sudden, they start like this. And I wrote a little 
article. I always used to go talk to them. I'd talk

07:16.170 --> 07:21.017
to them at Chamber of Commerce and there and places 
they'd get me to come up and talk to them. And I

07:21.037 --> 07:23.361
finally have a little article that has an outline. 
When you get older population, you're going to get

07:24.082 --> 07:26.686
reproduction. You get malnutrition. You get 
parasitism. You get crowding, male-female

07:28.709 --> 07:31.534
imbalance. You get all these things occur. Man 
creates them and puts them in an eight-foot fence.

07:37.546 --> 07:41.170
If the weather, normally they migrate if they run 
out of fruit on that place. When you put them in an

07:41.250 --> 07:43.933
eight-foot fence, they can't migrate. And I've 
been on ranches that some supposedly intelligent

07:43.953 --> 07:49.499
good people had, and they wouldn't feed them. 
You'd go out and be carcass land. Now, I wanted to.

07:52.842 --> 07:54.444
I've reported some of them to Humane Society. Some 
of the people were afraid of them. They had a lot of

07:56.787 --> 07:58.649
clout. But anyway, you can imagine what you get. 
And it's still going on, and it's... It's going to

08:05.457 --> 08:13.408
continue to go on, but mainly in Texas, in my 
opinion, at the present time, the trophy heads are

08:05.457 --> 08:13.408
worth more than anything. But ostriches are hot 
now, llamas are hot, and it's going to go from

08:14.189 --> 08:21.238
animal to animal. Llamas are a big thing. I used to 
refer llamas. I used to have a client at Fort

08:25.084 --> 08:32.133
Terrace Ranch in the other side of Junction, a real 
fine man, Mr. Noel, had just a play thing. He just

08:32.153 --> 08:34.857
had a few because of friends, and he liked them. 
You'd get ostriches, everything just running

08:35.107 --> 08:36.909
around. They were all gentle. You could feed them. 
A male ostrich, by the way, besides a casserine, is

08:40.272 --> 08:46.219
probably the most dangerous. They have a middle 
toe about that long. And with a male ostrich, I have

08:48.761 --> 08:54.587
pictures of dents in pickup trucks. A male ostrich 
in mating season will attack a bulldozer or an

08:54.607 --> 08:59.152
airplane. He has no fear of anything. We've had to 
decoy him to get through fences. They can jump up

09:04.655 --> 09:05.977
and hit you. They can open you up. I've got pictures 
of them. They're very dangerous. Most people

09:10.705 --> 09:11.486
don't realize it. Oh, they're dangerous. That's 
the reason I'm glad to refer those to stuff. All

09:15.813 --> 09:20.760
your large breeds of birds at the zoo, I learned 
this over Mr. Chisholm when I first went. Big

09:21.201 --> 09:23.304
pelicans and cranes that have long beaks. Like Tom 
said, the animal that's raised in captivity has no

09:23.885 --> 09:28.432
fear of man. He is the most dangerous. All for 
different reasons. And you walk in one of their

09:32.245 --> 09:34.689
pens and they'll walk up to you. And if they don't 
like it, before they hit you in the eye. So you never

09:37.953 --> 09:42.099
get into it and never let them get too close to you. 
So that's a true statement there. But anyway, so,

09:43.822 --> 09:48.028
you know, let's see. I was kind of putting an 
outline in front of it. Oh, that's interesting,

09:49.710 --> 09:50.892
too. That's good information. But it's a changing 
picture. And cage birds, like Tom said, are just,

09:58.233 --> 10:01.017
And exotic animals are just going crazy in this 
state. We have a climate where a lot of them do well

10:01.057 --> 10:08.750
and we have a lot of people with small ranches and 
farms that get interested and have a little extra

10:01.057 --> 10:08.750
money. So when did you, when did you essentially 
step out of the zoo work? Well I, I, oh let's see, 78

10:14.739 --> 10:23.413
to 80 something, about nine years ago. And then 
they got another veterinarian and he quit and I

10:23.883 --> 10:29.910
went back and worked with him on a contract 
part-time basis. And now they call it a swab and

10:30.050 --> 10:35.296
he's out of town. I like ranch exotic work. I really 
like it. It's challenging. It's every ranch is

10:38.620 --> 10:40.062
different. It's a different environment.

10:44.207 --> 10:45.929
You have partners, associates? No, I'm by myself. 
Dr. James and I sold that place. Everybody's

10:49.052 --> 10:53.097
scattered like a bunch of quail. You're not 
thinking about bringing anybody else in with you?

10:56.944 --> 10:57.865
No, I want to keep it simple. I want to keep it simple 
and do what I can do. You know, you get a little

11:01.629 --> 11:12.881
older, you get cranky, and you get more 
particular, and you kind of, I know what I know, and

11:01.629 --> 11:12.881
I know my limitations, and I'll refer somebody 
else to something I can do, I think I can do justice

11:01.629 --> 11:12.881
to. I'll do it. If not, I'll refer somebody else. Do 
you have any working associations at A&M, at the

11:15.504 --> 11:20.569
college or anything, or do you have much 
involvement with them at all? Not right now. We

11:22.279 --> 11:35.091
were talking about having some practitioners 
that are knowledgeable and experienced come up

11:22.279 --> 11:35.091
and have some little group seminars, kind of like 
Tom was doing, except he was doing it for the

11:22.279 --> 11:35.091
students and the other practitioners. But 
they're going to have to do it because unless they

11:35.111 --> 11:43.458
get a couple of knowledgeable professors out 
there that are more versatile. Well, and the

11:43.478 --> 11:49.864
problem is we've recommended for the last several 
years that they get a clinician. full-time

11:50.587 --> 11:56.873
clinician, at least in Cagesburg Medicine or in 
Cagesburg Medicine and other exotics. And the

11:56.953 --> 12:05.341
problem in talking with Dr. Samuelson is the fact 
that the college can get money for a piece of

11:56.953 --> 12:05.341
equipment easier than they can for a new staff 
position. And so their budget limitations have

12:06.062 --> 12:10.406
really thwarted that. They want to do that, but 
they've just not been able to do that. The

12:14.309 --> 12:20.475
gentleman he talked about is Cagesburg, and they 
have Dr. Jensen, a young veterinarian who I talked

12:14.309 --> 12:20.475
to at the state meeting a while But they need it. 
They have to use him in everything. He can't just

12:25.318 --> 12:28.603
dedicate himself to exotics and that kind of 
thing. I called up there last week and talked to Dr.

12:28.623 --> 12:35.133
Julep, who's in charge of postgraduate seminars. 
He's a personal friend of mine. And he said,

12:37.196 --> 12:41.263
they're hard to catch, and I want to go up and visit 
with them for a day. And they're just snowed. Yeah.

12:45.700 --> 12:49.025
Well, you know, that same area, the interest is 
really there. You know, Walter can tell you that

12:49.065 --> 13:10.054
we, I think it was, I don't know, four or five years 
ago, we held the first Caged Bird seminar,

12:49.065 --> 13:10.054
continuing education seminar for 
practitioners, and I was on the program, and we

12:49.065 --> 13:10.054
brought,

12:49.065 --> 13:10.054
let's see, I think we brought Susan Club in from 
Florida, and Dr. Fred Seufer from from Houston.

13:12.014 --> 13:14.397
Yeah, you need to talk to Fred. And we put on the 
first avian seminar at A&M, and it was the best

13:14.457 --> 13:25.169
attended seminar that they'd ever put on up there. 
And still continues to be. Each year they have an

13:27.031 --> 13:33.778
avian seminar, and Walter said it still continues 
to be the best attended seminar he puts on. So the

13:34.379 --> 13:37.843
interest is really there from the practitioners. 
Many of them are only going to see maybe a few of

13:40.105 --> 13:45.651
these animals, but they want some knowledge when 
they do get confronted with it. I have young

13:45.751 --> 13:55.582
veterinarians, and I'm sure Tom does too, that 
call me, and I'm charging them consultations

13:45.751 --> 13:55.582
because I don't want to keep giving out my dosages 
that it took me 20 years to learn. And they don't

13:56.023 --> 13:57.124
know anything. They're in a small town. They're 
doing a mixed practice because they have to. And

14:02.150 --> 14:03.751
somebody has a llama. Somebody has an ostrich. 
Somebody has this giraffe here last week. And they

14:08.737 --> 14:09.758
call. And a lot of them have been calling me because 
I'm one of the few that used to go and stay at ranches

14:10.177 --> 14:18.945
on general exotics. And I don't know it all, but I 
learned a lot. And so I try to help them and give them

14:23.469 --> 14:27.993
at least something to do. But that's why Tom says 
it. The ostrich seminar, they had a great crowd up

14:30.415 --> 14:34.819
there last month. They had a llama seminar. Dr. 
Murray Fowle from Davis, California, is probably

14:38.712 --> 14:41.435
the most knowledgeable general exotic man in the 
world. One of them. And then they're going to have

14:44.037 --> 14:48.021
more of them, I'm sure. They need them. They have 
to. The veterinarians are just groping for

14:48.901 --> 14:51.143
knowledge. And they have to get it or refer to 
somebody else. But we should become more

14:54.266 --> 14:57.309
specialized than we're going to. That's good. 
That's a good thing. That's been fascinating.

15:00.912 --> 15:04.336
Let's shift to another area of pioneering 
veterinary medicine. Yeah, the real pioneer. The

15:05.477 --> 15:06.998
real pioneer. In other words, could you tell me a 
little bit, tell us about how you got into the

15:07.771 --> 15:21.784
business and your background and your 
recollections of entering into the profession,

15:07.771 --> 15:21.784
your problems and measures and so forth. Well, I 
was born here in San Antonio. Okay. And what is your

15:25.227 --> 15:27.509
full name? Norma Anelna Betts. My husband's name 
is Brockley, B-R-A-U-C-H-L-E. So I have a nice

15:34.236 --> 15:36.698
alias I can hide. Well,

15:36.863 --> 15:50.501
I kind of feel

15:36.863 --> 15:50.501
like this. I lose my identity completely. 
Somebody wants to come to town that I knew 30 years

15:53.545 --> 16:01.656
ago, they'd never find me.

16:02.378 --> 16:08.509
I didn't know there was a legal reason for doing 
that. No, I do it where I work. I'm in the elder beds

16:09.871 --> 16:11.153
of Brockley. I think many of the married gals do 
that. My daddy busted his butt putting me through

16:14.860 --> 16:19.207
school. Retain their maiden name as their 
professional name. Excuse me, go ahead. No, I was

16:26.340 --> 16:27.542
born here. Oh, I decided when I was about seven I 
wanted to be a veterinarian. Did you really? Yeah,

16:31.831 --> 16:34.074
my dad said, well, you know, the sky's the limit. 
There was nothing that he ever told me that I

16:34.514 --> 16:38.038
couldn't accomplish. I grew up thinking the world 
was my oyster. I'm serious. My daddy never told me,

16:43.604 --> 16:47.328
you can't do this or you can't do that. You've got to 
have that attitude to a certain degree. Too many

16:51.072 --> 16:52.934
obstacles. I graduated from Burbank High School.

16:58.555 --> 17:02.220
I tried to get into A&M, and of course they didn't 
want me. When was that? This was back in graduating

17:03.582 --> 17:06.646
from Burbank in 43. I was 16 years old. And we had 
just gone through a short period over there where

17:08.269 --> 17:12.995
they had a few women come to school. Oh, the summer 
is all they take. Yeah, because I went over and

17:14.978 --> 17:18.703
talked to Dr. Turk on many occasions. You don't 
know him. He was long before you. Dr. Turk and Dr.

17:21.407 --> 17:25.172
Robinson tried. Yeah, they did try. They did try. 
Because there were a few who were there full-time

17:27.585 --> 17:32.654
in the late 30s because of the depression, local 
faculty-wise. Yeah, faculty-wise and

17:32.674 --> 17:38.285
offspring, but that was all, and certainly not in 
the area of medicine. No, that's right. I mean,

17:38.846 --> 17:40.108
that's no place for a female. That was one of the old 
eyes. So my dad wrote the commission of education

17:43.013 --> 17:49.285
here, who was at that time Leo Edwards. He wrote him 
back that they didn't send women out of state

17:49.906 --> 17:53.029
schools. They'd send black out of state schools, 
but not a woman. That made my daddy upset. So I

17:58.675 --> 17:59.876
applied to Auburn. It was either Auburn or 
Colorado State. There weren't that many

18:03.199 --> 18:05.041
veterinary schools then. And those that did have 
vet schools certainly didn't want to accept a

18:05.401 --> 18:14.971
student from a state that had a veterinary school 
of their own. But you really had a double problem. I

18:16.332 --> 18:17.273
can see that. That's right. Went to Auburn, 
applied for, well, did my pre-vet work there.

18:26.642 --> 18:29.166
About a year or two later, my family moved there. 
That way, I was a resident. And got in vet school.

18:34.655 --> 18:35.496
See, I'm on through. We were back on the quarter 
system then. Took us four years, three months, and

18:39.263 --> 18:42.808
11 days straight through. It's tough. It's during 
the war. Learned a lot. So your family really put a

18:49.643 --> 18:57.210
lot into it for you with that degree. And then you 
got your degree and you came back to Texas right

18:57.230 --> 19:00.352
away. Came back, yeah. The same time. That was 
home. My grandparents were here. So the summer

19:07.759 --> 19:17.608
before I graduated, old Dr. Wharton got me a job 
with Gene Ingram, who I'm sure you've met in the

19:07.759 --> 19:17.608
optosis. at a clinic there on Broadway. Oh, I 
remember, yeah. I was trying to think of his name.

19:27.547 --> 19:28.469
Howard. And Dr. Barton kind of took me under his 
wing. Be careful. You better be careful. I never

19:37.403 --> 19:40.047
had any problem with him. I knew him when I was in 
high school. He used to come out to Burbank and talk

19:41.329 --> 19:43.953
to the class. You weren't one of the seven wives? 
No. His seventh wife or his fifth wife shot him in

19:47.592 --> 19:50.736
the face. Oh, man, I can... Put a hole through his 
head you could throw your hat through. Shot him

19:55.483 --> 19:59.368
three times, once in the front, once in the back, 
and once in the side as he turned. And then shot his

19:59.448 --> 20:05.396
ex, one of the other ex-wives ran to the bathroom 
and she emptied a gun in the bathroom door. Well, he

20:05.416 --> 20:11.365
was visiting one of his ex-wives and this other one 
of his ex-wives... Early days of the old west. Hey,

20:13.107 --> 20:19.314
you know, all I can say is he did marry him. Ingram 
now is, are you in a partnership? No, no, no, no. I

20:25.741 --> 20:27.643
just worked for him the summer before I graduated. 
That was all. And then when I graduated, I came

20:29.825 --> 20:31.687
back. Dr. Wharton got me a job down at Swift's with 
Dr. Fisher. who is now retired and is in . Is that

20:40.963 --> 20:42.545
where he is? The wife is a physician. She's a health 
director down there. Well, I'll be down there. And

20:48.553 --> 20:56.242
I just decided I really wanted all those darn 
single trees on the floor and those tubs all day

20:48.553 --> 20:56.242
long. And I was, shoo, I couldn't take it. And you 
were inspecting? Yeah, livers, gallbladders. A

21:06.179 --> 21:07.421
real glamorous job. That's right. Oh, hey, you 
know, at least they equipped you. I mean, you could

21:11.927 --> 21:15.752
get the chain gloves, you know, and stuff like 
that. So I went back and graduated. There was a guy

21:17.815 --> 21:27.528
in Georgia who wanted me to come to work for him, so I 
went and took the state board in Atlanta. I was the

21:28.289 --> 21:30.472
first woman to make the state board there. It was 
big, plastered all over the newspaper. Is that

21:33.196 --> 21:33.596
right? She was the only girl in our... When

21:35.288 --> 21:45.224
I started the school, there were 50 of us in a 
pre-vet class. Like I said, four years, three

21:45.244 --> 21:50.692
months, and 11 days later, two of us of that 50 
graduated together. The rest of them flunked out

21:52.635 --> 21:56.201
or went into the military. And out of the 27 in our 
class, 25 were veterans or add-ons. Only from the

22:03.622 --> 22:08.747
Okefenokee Swamp in Georgia. And I finished 
together. Were there other women in that

22:11.089 --> 22:16.654
group? Had there been other women through the 
program before at Auburn? Two. Is that right?

22:21.139 --> 22:28.265
Lucille Demerling and Marie Hall-Alberger, who 
is quite a mycologist. I think she did a master's

22:28.285 --> 22:32.790
when she was here. Pardon me. She

22:33.575 --> 22:38.080
went to work for Auburn. She was faculty. She was 
there when I went back for the last reunion. Came

22:44.727 --> 22:47.150
back here, went in small animal practice. Are you 
going in on your own? No, I went with Bob

22:49.392 --> 22:53.196
Sturdivant, went to the Aftosa thing. You 
remember Bob Sturdivant? He's in that because he

22:55.499 --> 22:57.361
did zoo work. Everybody that I could find did zoo 
work. is in there about the time they did it. It

23:02.529 --> 23:03.150
might help you. Bob went to a post-problem foot and 
mouth in Mexico. And David Sprinkle, who was a

23:09.536 --> 23:24.291
small animal veterinarian and lived out here on 
what was then almost Luke Road, had a clinic and a

23:09.536 --> 23:24.291
kennel just down the road from Leo Holbrook.

23:27.013 --> 23:29.856
And I took over the clinic in Alma Heights. David 
decided he's going to go back into service and that

23:30.983 --> 23:34.267
left me. And it wasn't really very lucrative. 
Sturdivant hadn't been a very frugal

23:40.695 --> 23:45.340
businessman.

23:48.644 --> 23:50.146
That's saying it nicely. Yes, that's very nice. We 
can all have comments. His creditors came and got

23:59.738 --> 24:08.186
his x-ray machine first,

23:59.738 --> 24:08.186
and came and got some of his other equipment. Were 
you leasing, or what was your situation right now?

24:10.949 --> 24:19.998
Well, I was paying the rent on the place, and then 
splitting the take with this guy who's in Mexico.

24:20.218 --> 24:26.685
And finally, he said, hey, man, ain't nothing here 
anymore to practice with, you know? Bob was known

24:26.705 --> 24:29.087
as, I think, probably The best term, kindest term 
is a maverick.

24:37.070 --> 24:40.417
He was a wheeler and dealer outside of veterinary 
medicine. Got him in trouble all the time. I saw him

24:41.980 --> 24:50.738
one time over at Dale's gun shop and he was buying 
some, oh he went in there and bought a whole bunch of

24:41.980 --> 24:50.738
ammunition and a bunch of clay pigeons, you know. 
And a friend of mine was with me in bed there, and he

24:51.123 --> 24:56.170
said, well, so-and-so, he owes me, I don't know, 
$300 or $400 for this and that. He didn't care. He'd

24:57.532 --> 25:02.959
borrow stuff from everybody in town, and then 
they'd pay back drugs and everything else. He was a

25:02.979 --> 25:04.381
nice fellow, just nice. But I mean, he just, he was 
astute. So your business is disappearing. An

25:09.247 --> 25:10.749
astute. Yes. Your business is physically 
disappearing. Yeah. The equipment was just about

25:13.934 --> 25:18.300
to cut. And about that time, Bob and I decided to get 
married, and we leased a sprinkles place out here

25:19.861 --> 25:35.601
on Almost Loop Road, which later became Lawndale,

25:19.861 --> 25:35.601
and had a kennel there, so I had a clinic there.

25:38.725 --> 25:40.587
And that was for a long time. Your husband's not a 
veteran. No, he's an Aggie, though. He taught in

25:43.631 --> 25:45.434
the veteran's school I taught in. That's what I was 
going to say. He taught now in the veteran's

25:47.296 --> 25:49.699
training program. And they needed another slot. 
And you and I, I think, were out there at the same

25:52.789 --> 25:54.992
time. Because I was out in Martinez. Oh, were you 
there? Yeah, I was at Martinez. And you were? I was

26:02.059 --> 26:03.221
at Charlotte. Yeah. And Harold was in Poteet. 
Poteet. And we rotated. It was the Atascosa County

26:10.208 --> 26:12.551
Vocational School. And it was Veterans Training 
Program. Ranch Boys. Instead of going to college,

26:17.216 --> 26:18.437
they got I went to school a couple of days a week. 
Yeah, I went to school a couple of days a week. And

26:22.465 --> 26:29.331
talking about diseases and genetics, no physical 
treatment or anything. I didn't compromise. You

26:31.814 --> 26:32.875
did like I did. I just kind of got to look at it and 
generalize. Yeah, I mean, as far as compromising

26:35.618 --> 26:45.167
or prostituting my profession, I don't think I can 
be accused of doing that.

26:46.531 --> 26:55.166
Of course, when I came back to take the state board, 
Dr. Robinson got Ed Hornicle to get me some old

26:46.531 --> 26:55.166
quizzes. That's... Okay, let me ask you about the 
state board. When you came back to take the state

26:59.433 --> 27:02.458
board, was that a problem at all? No, I don't think 
it was a problem, was it? Had other women finished

27:05.245 --> 27:08.369
taking the state board? Were there other women 
practitioners in Texas at the time? Or do you know

27:10.371 --> 27:11.573
anything specific about it? Yeah, old Campbell 
was in Dallas with Dr. MacLeod. Did it even occur to

27:15.658 --> 27:19.763
you that you were doing something different by 
coming back to practice? Oh, I had no problem

27:19.783 --> 27:22.966
knowing that it was something different. The

27:23.747 --> 27:32.077
members of my class made that perfectly clear. 
Were you the only girl in the class in law school?

27:34.625 --> 27:42.193
Well, see, when we took, I was at A&M, I just 
graduated, and she was the only girl, of course, we

27:34.625 --> 27:42.193
had the only girl students at A&M at the time. I was 
the only one up there taking the state board. How

27:44.315 --> 27:47.459
were you received locally by your colleagues 
here? Well,

27:49.141 --> 27:56.969
there were three who really went to bat for me. Dr. 
Ray, who happened to be on the board at that time, Al

27:56.989 --> 28:04.277
Nagel, who is still living, and Walt Lawrence, who 
is not living. Harry Flaticle said, will you come

28:05.962 --> 28:07.985
out? Yeah, you come to work for me. You want me to 
clean cages? I said, really? I've done enough of

28:11.572 --> 28:12.513
that. Thank you. If I'm going to clean cages, I'm 
going to do it for myself. And so we started the

28:18.684 --> 28:23.232
clinic out here, just over the hill from Leo 
Holbrook. What was the name of your clinic? Was it

28:27.539 --> 28:28.300
Broadway? No, I don't know. Was it Leo Holbrooks? 
No, Holbrooks was Broadway. That was Broadway.

28:35.064 --> 28:35.585
Airport. Airport, that's right. Why am I saying 
that? Heck, it's still on my checks. Yeah, that's

28:39.650 --> 28:41.352
right. Airport. Airport. And you and your husband 
were in the business together? No, he was with the

28:48.261 --> 28:51.646
Atascosa County Vocational School. He's a 
teacher. He's a counselor. Yeah, I know that. I

28:54.129 --> 28:55.771
know he's not a... Yeah, he's not right in there. 
But he's not a business associate either in that

28:55.791 --> 28:58.815
sense. Back then and maybe still now, I'm not sure. 
You've got to be a veterinarian to be part of the

29:01.447 --> 29:05.935
practice. I didn't know if you could have a 
business associate. I've never even thought of

29:09.260 --> 29:12.285
having a business associate. It's been illegal up 
until recently. I don't know anybody that is. This

29:16.312 --> 29:19.998
was back when Gleason. Before Dr. Gleason? Well, 
before I graduated from college, old Dr. Gleason

29:21.080 --> 29:26.509
and Dr. Ray. Dr. Ray and, oh, who was the one on San 
Pedro? Who was the one down on San Pedro? I want to,

29:34.078 --> 29:34.999
Burby. Burby. Would go out and do TB testing and 
stuff on cattle. And somebody called and phoned,

29:44.634 --> 29:47.839
well, I'll do it for 50 cents a head. and they'll 
call somebody else, well, Dr. So-and-so says

29:48.427 --> 29:53.353
he'll do it for 50 cents, well, I'll do it for 40. I 
mean, you talk about cutthroat. Well, it's come

29:55.416 --> 29:57.018
full circle. It's right back where it used to be. 
This is just exactly what I was going to say. How

30:02.745 --> 30:08.332
long it took us to clean up, if you would, the 
telephone book. We talked about that this

30:09.093 --> 30:10.395
morning. And Judas Priest, look at it now. It's 
like a bunch of lawyers. It's worse than it was

30:14.340 --> 30:18.265
before. I mean, if that's what veterinary 
medicine is all about, that's fine. It's not for

30:23.118 --> 30:23.819
me. Now, when you started in your clinic, are you 
doing almost exclusively small animal at this

30:23.879 --> 30:30.086
time? Yes. Are you doing any large animal 
practice? Well, a little bit. My husband didn't

30:36.253 --> 30:39.417
exactly look with favor on the large animal. The 
majority of it was some lameness and some screw

30:40.939 --> 30:47.847
worms that I picked out of a horse's hoof and scared 
the hell out of him. But I did limit it. There were

30:54.212 --> 30:55.754
horses around us. We were in the county, just 
inside Lukeport County. It was not in the city at

30:59.398 --> 31:00.659
all. Broadway didn't even run all the way through 
out here. Scrivener's was the end of the earth,

31:03.942 --> 31:06.785
wasn't it? Not the country. I mean, you see deer 
running right out here where this building is. The

31:11.490 --> 31:13.051
country store. Now, roughly what year is this when 
your clinic first opened? 48. 48. 40, yeah, 48, 49.

31:22.364 --> 31:24.706
See, I graduated in 47, December 47. So I was 48, 49. 
And I laughed about your poultry bit because we

31:28.650 --> 31:37.759
used to buy chicks from Casimir Cheryl Hatchery in 
Bryan, remember? They had the highline chickens.

31:40.422 --> 31:42.404
Yeah, highline chickens. And talk about the a brew 
mill over there. We dressed 150 friars every

31:46.985 --> 31:55.734
Saturday morning and took them over to art over 
here at Oak Grove. It was a brew mill and

31:57.577 --> 32:02.122
restaurant. Those first few years, could you talk 
about that in your clinic as you got started? Well,

32:07.488 --> 32:13.274
yeah, I guess I was somewhat of an oddity. I had done 
some relief work for Al Nagel and for Perry Stein

32:16.015 --> 32:18.639
and a few of the others around. So I wasn't 
ostracized by any potential clients that I would

32:19.259 --> 32:27.651
call. You didn't run into any client resistance? 
No, they'd call on the phone, you know, I need to

32:32.117 --> 32:36.763
talk to Dr. Betts, and I'd say, this is she. And over 
where I am now, you know, they'd call, man, hey,

32:37.845 --> 32:42.051
Dr., catch that lady on line four. Good afternoon, 
may I help you? I want to talk to the veterinarian.

32:45.985 --> 33:12.752
well I know because you know you know when Mary when 
Mary Mainster started with me you know I had some

32:45.985 --> 33:12.752
clients you know we're used to me and they'd say 
well I don't want that one there now conversely

32:45.985 --> 33:12.752
though would you not also have attracted a certain 
client I think this is because in households the

33:13.559 --> 33:16.362
the wife, the mother, is the one who takes care of 
the animals. Well, of course, Mary, we used to

33:16.382 --> 33:18.183
laugh about it. Mary would say, well, you know, she 
had one, and once in a while, didn't want that man in

33:18.203 --> 33:23.668
her ear. Yeah. So it worked out. Yeah. I didn't have 
any problem with myself. I mean, I knew this was

33:29.434 --> 33:33.397
what I wanted, and hey, you know, that's just the 
brains. Right. Okay. Now, our classmates used to

33:35.739 --> 33:41.845
razz me in our bacteriology props that Oh, Nellie, 
don't worry. There's always a vet school in

33:43.383 --> 33:47.247
Tuskegee for niggers and women. But I was the one 
that babysat his kids. I mean, I was the one that he

33:50.350 --> 33:52.893
called the babysat. Did you ever then have any 
continuing involvement or relations with A&M?

34:00.080 --> 34:00.361
No. With the problem of... No, I tell you the truth, 
I was just a little ticked with A&M. I can imagine

34:04.084 --> 34:06.267
you would be. In the common vernacular, yes. Yeah, 
I can imagine you would be. But then when I got in

34:10.090 --> 34:23.848
Ammo Control, I became really involved with the 
Texas Ammo Control Association on the ground

34:10.090 --> 34:23.848
floor with the initiation of that, and also with 
the National Ammo Control Association. And now, I

34:23.868 --> 34:32.119
know A&M campus better than Bob does, and when he 
went up there for his reunion last year, you want to

34:23.868 --> 34:32.119
go here? Well, it's not there. Yes, it is. I'll show 
you. It's changed considerably. Yeah. Yeah, boy.

34:36.825 --> 34:36.925
Yeah. So how long did you stay in, basically in 
private practice, is that the right word? Yeah,

34:41.729 --> 34:53.600
I guess full time until about 1960 when we moved 
over on Kennelworth. We sold a place over here. Oh,

34:56.743 --> 35:00.646
60, 61, somewhere in there. And I did relief work 
for veterinarians. in the area. And then Ed

35:09.811 --> 35:17.360
Hornigle called me in 75 and said, say, I want to 
come over here and work at Ample Control.

35:18.361 --> 35:22.145
Actually, what he said, do you want to come over and 
work the dog pound? I said, do you mean like full

35:22.165 --> 35:25.009
time? He said, yeah. And I said, I'll come over and 
follow you around for a while, and I'll tell you.

35:32.197 --> 35:33.979
So this is different. And that's what you're 
doing, right? You're the director? I'm in animal

35:36.878 --> 35:38.902
control. Are there others with you in the office? 
Dr. Lammers, a K-State graduate,

35:42.869 --> 35:48.919
he's been there almost 30 years. Ned Lammers. Does 
Crenshaw come over here? Elmo? Yeah, Elmo

35:55.227 --> 35:56.368
Crenshaw. He goes over to Austin. That's the 
Humane Society. They have a program where they...

35:59.812 --> 36:04.096
Well, no, but we work with them. I mean, we give them 
animals to adopt, and they were with us last year

36:04.116 --> 36:12.144
from February to August while they were 
remodeling their place. And, of course, Bill

36:12.224 --> 36:15.087
Bilderbeck serves on their board. Well, one of the 
really, I think, one of the really... top

36:18.813 --> 36:32.433
accomplishments that Denelda was involved with 
was for years in San Antonio, the humane

36:18.813 --> 36:32.433
organizations, humane society, has had an 
adversary relationship with the dog pound. It was

36:32.453 --> 36:40.745
a big bad thing, and they were down there 
demonstrating to city council and all kinds of bad

36:32.453 --> 36:40.745
things about it. And now they're working 
together. the Humane Society and the Animal

36:43.602 --> 36:46.408
Control Facility. And the Humane Society is 
adopting, handling their adoptions. They did

36:50.537 --> 36:51.439
last year. We're sending them animals when we have 
more than what we can feasibly adopt. So they've

36:55.749 --> 36:59.417
got a working relationship, which should have 
existed. you know for years there are any large

36:59.617 --> 37:25.202
facilities you don't have to humane side a lot when 
I look at animals I don't know study where are they

36:59.617 --> 37:25.202
gonna pull up well I mean they got a place really 
down the stockyards and put them in a pen well honey

36:59.617 --> 37:25.202
that's all we do that's all you can do where you 
gonna put them they told me they had the money but

36:59.617 --> 37:25.202
they didn't have the location so buy some property 
why don't they buy some property well they looked

36:59.617 --> 37:25.202
you know they looked I know they looked at trying to 
maybe sell that property and try to find another

37:25.503 --> 37:28.328
location. And they just couldn't really do it 
without costing them a lot of money. So they

37:31.173 --> 37:34.679
enlarged their present facility. There wasn't 
any reciprocity when I graduated. So I took the

37:39.306 --> 37:46.559
Alabama board, the Georgia board, and then came 
back here and took the Texas board with you. You

37:46.779 --> 37:49.484
went through the examination. Well, I figured, 
hey. I might as well do it now. Sure. Well, it's

37:52.982 --> 37:54.865
fresh on your mind. Yeah. Oh, they make quite a big 
deal of it, the Georgia board. Of course, Alabama

38:00.173 --> 38:04.700
has been two before me. Yeah. They accepted me. I 
don't think I was ever really outcast because I

38:06.483 --> 38:17.920
kept up with some of the profs and with some of my 
classmates who unfortunately are alive and dead

38:06.483 --> 38:17.920
now. Are all of you now pretty active in the Texas 
Veterinary Medical Association? Yeah. I'm on the

38:24.300 --> 38:25.662
ethics board. I'm enjoying it. I'm on the 
conference convention, I guess. I've served on

38:30.510 --> 38:40.087
public health and on historical quite a bit with 
Freud and, oh, what's his face, in Austin. And I'm

38:40.107 --> 38:41.950
on the public relations committee. Oh, Schaefer, 
no. No. I'm sorry, too. I knew Eddie Grist. Oh,

38:52.086 --> 38:53.989
yeah, Eddie. I worked with Eddie on the historical 
thing, but Eddie is sore. I haven't seen him in

38:58.916 --> 39:02.661
quite a while. Let me just throw this out real 
quick. What do you think each of you, that a history

39:04.704 --> 39:12.055
of veterinary medicine should do or say, or is 
there something special that you would think

39:12.254 --> 39:16.422
needs to be developed? Well, I think, I mean, I'll 
get it off my chest first. You know, I think we've

39:20.769 --> 39:35.055
talked about specialization, which to me 
increases efficiency,

39:20.769 --> 39:35.055
keeping up with seminars, postgraduate work. 
Well, I think that, to me, one of the things in

39:37.246 --> 39:49.322
looking back in my career in veterinary medicine 
is that I guess that professions have to change.

39:50.223 --> 39:51.284
That's part of that. And in a way, as you grow older, 
it's more difficult to change with it. But we've

39:58.433 --> 40:04.401
enjoyed a profession that's been very unique up to 
now. uh in which veterinarians really i think

40:05.073 --> 40:28.617
really felt like colleagues uh not like 
competitors and enjoyed a professionalism and a

40:05.073 --> 40:28.617
camaraderie among themselves that i see 
disappearing today we all do thank god and that's

40:05.073 --> 40:28.617
that's the part that is disturbing about what's 
happening and And RMM, Robert Miller, says it's

40:28.934 --> 40:35.883
because we've graduated too many veterinarians 
and there's too much competition. And I think that

40:35.903 --> 40:38.987
that certainly is a factor in it. I think that 
probably the federal government has played a role

40:39.707 --> 40:50.521
in striking down the traditional rules of 
professional conduct that have guided our

40:39.707 --> 40:50.521
professions for many, many years. That's my next 
question. Why is this happening? I think it's

40:55.527 --> 40:57.289
twofold. And I think there's a third factor 
involved in that that it's a change that has

40:58.904 --> 41:18.448
occurred in our young people the values our value 
systems uh after post post vietnam war and i think

40:58.904 --> 41:18.448
all of those things have played a role i think all of 
them have played a role but they all boil down to

40:58.904 --> 41:18.448
people Well, they do. We've seen that everywhere. 
In the Department of History, I was department

41:21.838 --> 41:23.740
head. I hired a bunch of people, and they are the 
most cutthroat bunch of people I've ever seen.

41:28.045 --> 41:29.086
It's a huge trend. And we all see it. So I don't think 
you can lay it at any one doorstep. But I think you

41:33.090 --> 41:36.894
agree, Billy, are those the prime reasons? Yeah, I 
think that it's a free. There's a different breed

41:39.376 --> 41:40.858
of animal out there. Yeah, that's right. Exactly. 
I think we need more cooperation. Now, where

41:43.741 --> 41:45.783
that's going to lead to, I don't know. I kind of have 
a feeling. that things have a tendency to come full

41:48.550 --> 41:51.114
circle. And I remember I've been a consultant to 
Trinity University to their animal programs for

41:52.015 --> 41:59.006
about 25 years. And I go down there probably once 
every month or two and tour their animal

41:59.867 --> 42:11.545
facilities and get together with professors who 
are using animals and problems they're doing. And

42:11.565 --> 42:15.891
I can think back through what's happened on the 
campus And just thinking about it strictly from

42:16.546 --> 42:21.812
dress, a dress code. What went through and now it's 
come back and you see the kids now wearing ties,

42:21.832 --> 42:30.261
white shirts, girls wear dresses, need haircuts. 
I mean, you know, several years ago you go down

42:30.421 --> 42:40.232
there and, I mean, they're walking around with 
cut-off Levi's and T-shirts with no bras and, you

42:30.421 --> 42:40.232
know, I mean, hair down to here and, you know. And I 
look at what's happened in that and I can't help but

42:40.752 --> 42:45.878
think that that same thing is going to happen in our 
profession, I don't think that I'm going to be

42:46.280 --> 42:51.947
around to see it come the full circle. Or I may be 
around, but I won't be actively involved in

42:52.567 --> 42:56.552
practice at that point. But it's now like, the 
veterinarians come in and they're doing all these

42:56.832 --> 43:01.337
extended hours things. And I can remember when we 
started, when I started, we used to be open from 7 to

43:01.397 --> 43:09.467
9 on Thursday evening, all day Saturday. We had 
hours Sunday afternoon, usually three to four

43:09.807 --> 43:13.992
hours on Sunday afternoon. And then we all got 
together and said, well, let's knock out this

43:14.208 --> 43:19.093
evening and Sunday thing. And we found everybody 
said, oh, gee, everybody's wringing their hands.

43:21.475 --> 43:23.557
Oh, we're going to lose business, you know, and all 
that stuff. But we all did it. And boy, we

43:24.778 --> 43:28.581
compressed our business into shorter hours. And 
then pretty soon we started cutting our hours down

43:28.602 --> 43:31.324
on Saturday. And pretty soon we were closing at 
noon on Saturday. And we found out we did the same

43:33.346 --> 43:38.110
amount of business that we did in those extra 
hours. And we cut down our overheads and things

43:38.170 --> 43:40.873
like that. And I can't help but believe that 
veterinarians are keeping all these extended

43:41.242 --> 43:45.828
hours or something. We're going to begin to. That 
realization that they're just spreading their

43:47.009 --> 43:51.395
business out over a longer period. They're not 
capturing a lot of new business by doing that. The

43:55.400 --> 43:56.121
association. That it's going to come around to its 
realization. I think, just like Tom said, it's a

43:58.524 --> 44:03.129
group of happenings. And it's a trend. And I all 
business the country. It's happening in all the

44:06.333 --> 44:07.956
professions. It's dentistry, and law, and 
medicine. I mean, we're not unique. We don't agree

44:12.061 --> 44:12.802
with it. It's all not good. We used to have, at one 
time, we had a, these people all remember that. We

44:18.087 --> 44:22.551
had probably the most knit, close, neat 
organization. I mean, we had our knock-down,

44:22.571 --> 44:26.375
drag-out fights, but we all were friends when I was 
older. We used to argue. I can never remember our

44:28.096 --> 44:30.859
rabies meetings. I mean, they were classic. What 
percent of our veterans in town are members of our

44:33.061 --> 44:37.125
local association now? Half of them. I mean 
members. We used to have, I bet we had 98% of people,

44:41.424 --> 44:45.931
veterinarians, members. And they came to 
meetings. They came to meetings. We had things at

44:48.274 --> 44:50.117
4th Army. We had an Army man here who made all Army 
people. And we had a real, but now as things get

44:53.462 --> 45:04.219
larger, it's like these ranches, they get larger, 
they get... You know, another example, another

44:53.462 --> 45:04.219
example of that. is that when Wally Larson was the 
president of our association, he and I were

45:04.874 --> 45:14.623
sharing the old clinic down here, and he made me his 
program chair. And he sat down and, you know,

45:14.643 --> 45:23.953
coming from Wally, it was a shock to me when he sat 
down and said this, because Wally was a big country

45:14.643 --> 45:23.953
boy, you know, large animal practitioner. And he 
said, Tom, he said, I want to change our image of

45:24.673 --> 45:31.320
ourselves. He said, Every year we had our 
installation of officers in the association. We

45:37.673 --> 45:39.875
had a beer bust at Medina Lake. I mean, that was the 
installation. And he said, I want us to have a black

45:43.098 --> 45:46.582
tie affair. I want to invite all the local 
dignitaries we can invite. Let's have it at the St.

45:52.228 --> 45:54.390
Anthony Hotel. So I got going, and we planned that 
thing. And we invited the president of all the

45:57.760 --> 46:06.113
professional associations, all the base 
commanders and the health center commanders. And

46:06.153 --> 46:13.785
we happened to have the president of the Texas 
Medical Association with a San Antonio physician

46:06.153 --> 46:13.785
at that time. And we had the first formal 
installation at the St. Anthony Hotel. It was

46:18.031 --> 46:20.215
black tie only. And we had a packed crowd. And we had 
local politicians. It was the most successful

46:25.115 --> 46:34.085
image, and veterinarians walked away from that 
feeling, really feeling like they were really

46:25.115 --> 46:34.085
something. And I've heard talk now that the 
installation is going to revert back to a casual

46:34.185 --> 46:42.934
beer bus kind of thing. I said, Jesus. Here we go 
again. I mean, I walk in veterinary clinics, and I

46:46.638 --> 46:54.126
see veterinarians without ties and smocks on and 
things like that. And I say, well, you know, here we

46:54.511 --> 46:58.958
go again. When Al Nagel was president of the local 
association, we had our meetings down at the St.

46:59.038 --> 47:04.447
Anthony. And I mean, we had a dinner meeting, if you 
recall. And I really think that something like

47:11.038 --> 47:16.367
that has a tendency to raise us up a notch.
