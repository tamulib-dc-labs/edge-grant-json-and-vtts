00:11.776 --> 00:22.347
When you contacted seismic studies prior to World 
War II in terms of work, has the equipment changed a

00:11.776 --> 00:22.347
great deal since then, would you say? Or has it 
remained rather constant? No, there's been great

00:24.590 --> 00:32.038
improvements to equipment, largely due to the oil 
companies.

00:32.118 --> 00:38.024
The refraction seismic technique, I don't think I 
need to explain what it's all about, is much the

00:32.118 --> 00:38.024
same. But the refraction technique has become 
extremely sophisticated from the point of view of

00:41.054 --> 00:46.580
data processing. You now have hundreds of 
instruments out and combine them in quite subtle

00:46.600 --> 00:54.409
ways, combine the signals in quite subtle ways. 
This, of course, is caused partly by the

00:54.909 --> 01:02.297
extraordinary change in electronics. You see, 
one of the striking things in my life that has

01:02.537 --> 01:10.386
affected science so greatly is the change in 
electronics. There have been three major

01:10.788 --> 01:13.452
changes. When I was a young man, electronics 
worked with vacuum tubes, and this went on right up

01:14.033 --> 01:22.825
to something like 1950. No, later than that, 
almost 55 or 56, the vacuum tube was king, and

01:24.167 --> 01:31.718
everything had vacuum tubes in it. They were 
large, they were unreliable, they broke, they

01:32.279 --> 01:38.348
were an absolute pest, and I remember there was a 
joke saying there's nothing wrong with

01:38.800 --> 01:46.911
electronics which couldn't be cured by getting 
rid of the vacuum tube, which was, of course, the

01:38.800 --> 01:46.911
only electronic component, practically. Well, 
then the invention of the transistor made a

01:46.931 --> 01:50.596
difference. And I remember very well making the 
decision in my own lab that in future we would use

01:50.657 --> 02:03.014
transistors unless there was some reason to the 
contrary to use valves, that our standard would be

01:50.657 --> 02:03.014
to use transistors. Well, in about a couple of 
years, you could buy... little packages

02:06.948 --> 02:16.520
containing perhaps half a dozen transistors and 
doing some function like some logical function or

02:06.948 --> 02:16.520
a counting function or something of this kind. 
Well then we made another decision. We decided we

02:18.042 --> 02:20.946
wouldn't solder together our own transistors. 
We'd buy the little package units unless there was

02:21.627 --> 02:25.411
some reason to the contrary. Well that lasted some 
years and then suddenly we got integrated

02:26.132 --> 02:34.783
circuits and we got things a few millimeters 
across which would do these functions. So you had

02:34.803 --> 02:36.145
the three the four things, the three transitions, 
in this very short time, really, since the late

02:36.378 --> 02:43.286
50s. And this is the thing that's made all the 
difference. It's the same thing, of course,

02:46.611 --> 02:52.358
that's produced the pocket computers, things you 
couldn't conceive of doing. You can be much more

02:52.498 --> 02:56.302
fancy in your data analysis. You've probably 
heard about Walter Monk's ocean-bottom

02:56.322 --> 02:59.606
capsules. These are all dependent on this kind of 
thing. And all through science, it's may be

03:05.926 --> 03:09.692
possible to do things that you really couldn't 
have done before. And seismic reflection

03:10.353 --> 03:15.261
shooting is one of the critical things.

03:18.646 --> 03:22.232
Would you describe your instrument for measuring 
heat values? Would I describe it? Yes. Well, it's

03:24.896 --> 03:27.801
all in the literature, of course, but I'll 
certainly describe it. It was a tube about 10 feet

03:28.863 --> 03:33.570
long, a little over an inch in diameter, which 
contained the original apparatus you want, the

03:34.327 --> 03:38.694
one we started with. The first one we had, the 
temperature measurements were made by

03:38.714 --> 03:43.402
thermocouples. We had copper constant and 
thermocouples in it, and we measured the

03:43.723 --> 03:59.710
temperature difference between the bottom of the 
tube and the top of the tube, and the middle of the

03:43.723 --> 03:59.710
tube and the top of the tube, so that we got two 
temperature differences. the wires from these

04:00.230 --> 04:25.219
thermocouples ran into a pressure-tight 
container at the top, fastened onto the top of the

04:00.230 --> 04:25.219
tube, and the whole thing was lowered down into the 
sea on a wire, and when it got near the bottom, we

04:00.230 --> 04:25.219
arranged for it to be dropped and to go rapidly, 
shoot down into the bottom, and this tube

04:00.230 --> 04:25.219
penetrated in 10 feet or 15 feet, whatever its 
length was. You left it there for half an hour and

04:25.760 --> 04:30.085
then pulled it out again. This I developed here in 
La Jolla in the summer of 1949 with Art Maxwell, who

04:31.094 --> 04:43.228
was a graduate student. And you built this in the 
lab? I built it myself in the scripts workshops

04:45.090 --> 04:49.595
with my own hands and Maxwell's hands. And so you in 
effect knew about what you wanted. Was there any

04:54.461 --> 04:55.482
other temperature measuring device which gave 
you clues on how to build it? First of all, at one

05:00.471 --> 05:02.894
point I think we got wrong. I thought of this before 
the war, but we actually did it after the war in

05:03.355 --> 05:07.841
1949. I think you asked me the question in terms of 
what we did before the war. I measured heat flow on

05:11.866 --> 05:16.392
land in England and South Africa before the war. I 
had the idea of measuring it at sea before the war,

05:16.933 --> 05:23.722
but I didn't actually get it done until after the 
war. And this apparatus This first one we built

05:25.550 --> 05:28.995
here never actually worked. It was clearly 
possible there were trivial things wrong with it,

05:29.095 --> 05:42.073
and Art Maxwell built a thing with a rather 
different recording arrangement, and I built one

05:29.095 --> 05:42.073
like the original one in England, and they both 
worked. Sorry, you asked me a question. No, you've

05:43.915 --> 05:46.499
answered it. I was wondering where you got the 
idea. The answer is I suppose... Oh, no, let me say a

05:48.061 --> 05:52.367
little more about it. Just before we did the job 
here, a man, Norwegian, whose name escapes me,

05:53.528 --> 06:08.732
I'll remember it in a minute, had the same idea 
independently, and he was a Dane. The Danes had a

06:08.892 --> 06:21.612
round-the-world trip, oceanographic, ocean 
floor trip, just in the early, middle 50s.

06:22.385 --> 06:31.074
I think it was the early 50s, I think, and he 
actually used this apparatus, I think, before we

06:22.385 --> 06:31.074
got ours to work. He didn't get any results. He got 
some temperature differences, but what they,

06:34.197 --> 06:40.964
undoubtedly, they were due to friction on pushing 
the thing in. When the spike goes in, it rubs on the

06:41.045 --> 06:51.075
sediments and warms itself up, and you have to 
leave it in for something like half an hour on the

06:41.045 --> 06:51.075
sizes we had. to settle down. Otherwise, you get 
two or three times too high a value. And he got

06:55.868 --> 06:56.929
absurd. Well, some of the results were reasonable 
and some of them were absurd. And I think no one has,

07:00.072 --> 07:02.614
they've never been quoted again. And I think they 
were beyond question wrong. But he has, in a sense,

07:05.677 --> 07:08.701
the priority on it. And I'm only sorry I can't 
remember his name. He's a well-known Danish

07:12.384 --> 07:19.932
oceanographer who went on this round-the-world 
trip, mostly collecting sediments. Afterwards,

07:20.367 --> 07:28.115
Maxwell and various people made smaller versions 
of it in which you don't have to leave it quite so

07:20.367 --> 07:28.115
long. You can leave it for 10 minutes instead of 
half an hour, and this is quite a help. Of course,

07:32.040 --> 07:37.746
the ship always pulled my apparatus and bent the 
probe, so I always, every time, I had to straighten

07:32.040 --> 07:37.746
it. When you went to Toronto, did you have any 
innovations in mind as far as changing the nature

07:40.349 --> 07:47.877
of the department or the faculty there? Well, I 
didn't know much about it, of course, when I went.

07:51.922 --> 07:55.347
I'd never been there, and so I could hardly go with 
much idea. I went with a certain apprehension

07:55.367 --> 08:15.417
because there was a geophysical section there run 
by Jock Wilson, J. Tuzo Wilson, who was a very old

07:55.367 --> 08:15.417
friend of mine, and I thought he might feel that to 
have another geophysicist come in as head of the

07:55.367 --> 08:15.417
department was, in a sense, detrimental to him, 
but he was extremely good about it. And the thing,

08:19.432 --> 08:27.362
one of the things I was interested in was

08:19.432 --> 08:27.362
boosting up this project. It was a very, rather 
small project, and I was only there for two years.

08:31.848 --> 08:35.413
We did expand it quite a bit. And, I mean, I'd left 
pure physics 10 years, 20 years before nearly, and

08:36.074 --> 08:44.745
it... was obviously a thing I had to feel my way with 
a bit to take over, take charge of a very large

08:45.451 --> 08:55.002
physics department. There were interesting 
things going there. They were doing work on

08:56.564 --> 08:59.207
developing the electron microscope. They were 
doing work on spectroscopy, which I didn't know

08:59.808 --> 09:05.775
much about. Some low temperature work. There were 
quite nice things going on there. Then I got very

09:09.920 --> 09:12.403
interested in the setting up of a computer center 
there. I mean, 49 was early days for this. And we set

09:16.854 --> 09:23.822
up one of the first of the things that all 
universities now have, a computer center. So I had

09:23.842 --> 09:27.927
an interesting time there. What about at 
Admiralty when you were in operational research

09:27.947 --> 09:32.112
there? Did you try to bring any new ideas into 
Admiralty? Well, what we were interested in doing

09:35.116 --> 09:41.023
was examining, we regarded operations analysis 
as the examination of past operations to

09:41.341 --> 09:53.657
understand what happened and why, and to use this 
information in the planning of future

09:41.341 --> 09:53.657
operations. The critical, probably the most 
important project in that group, this group was

09:54.338 --> 10:07.635
run by Patrick Blackett, the most important 
project, I think, was the arguments about the size

09:54.338 --> 10:07.635
of convoys.

10:09.134 --> 10:13.480
a considerable split in the Navy about the proper 
size for convoys. I mean, on the obvious

10:13.640 --> 10:21.872
difficulty, if a convoy is very large, it's 
conspicuous, and you may lose a lot of ships if it's

10:13.640 --> 10:21.872
attacked. If a convoy is very small, it'll have to 
have rather few defensive vessels, rather few

10:21.892 --> 10:31.746
escort vessels, because there'll be more convoys 
to divide the escort vessels between. Where does

10:31.806 --> 10:33.589
the balance come? How fast does a ship have to be not 
to go in convoy at all? These kinds of questions,

10:38.035 --> 10:40.479
fascinating questions. I didn't have very much to 
do with this. I knew all about it, and I talked about

10:43.623 --> 10:47.068
it continuously. But Blackett and some other 
people, Henry Hume particularly, did most of

10:47.108 --> 10:54.359
this. My own main interest, I think, I was 
interested in arguments about the use of air

10:54.499 --> 11:02.952
power. whether we should use it on flying bombs, 
whether one should divert aircraft from the

11:03.607 --> 11:11.919
bombing of Germany to coastal command. This has 
all been published now, this great controversy

11:11.959 --> 11:28.102
about the use of air power, how far it was desirable 
to use aeroplanes to knock down German housing,

11:11.959 --> 11:28.102
and how far it was better to concentrate on 
particular objectives. And I spent a lot of time on

11:30.590 --> 11:32.753
intelligence connection with this. And then, as I 
told you yesterday, I was very interested in, very

11:32.833 --> 11:51.101
much concerned with the German development of the 
V weapons, the flying bombs and the rockets, and

11:32.833 --> 11:51.101
getting an understanding of what was likely to 
happen, what ought to be done about it. A very

11:51.121 --> 11:58.993
important question, of course, because these 
things were very embarrassingly likely to arrive

11:51.121 --> 11:58.993
just before the invasion of France. And we didn't 
quite know how the British public would react. It

12:04.202 --> 12:14.591
obviously depended on the intensity of the attack 
on London, whether they would demand that they be

12:04.202 --> 12:14.591
defended from this, and we'd have to cut down the 
effort in France. I mean, it was extremely

12:14.691 --> 12:19.275
important to understand what was likely to 
happen. And in fact, we managed, by destroying the

12:19.816 --> 12:27.563
sites, to postpone the attack until after the 
landings in France. We were lucky that way, I

12:28.049 --> 12:29.911
think. Because there was a great argument as to 
whether it was necessary to land in France. The Air

12:34.975 --> 12:44.164
Force believed, for emotional reasons, that if 
you knocked down 30% of all the houses in Germany,

12:34.975 --> 12:44.164
you would, in fact, end the war. This turned out not 
to be true, but a really terrible thing,

12:45.585 --> 12:56.335
deliberately to go out and use air power to destroy 
housing and kill civilians. It's one of the great

12:56.855 --> 13:03.822
war crimes, of course, by anything but our current 
standards. I mean, by any standards of war from the

13:03.862 --> 13:10.208
17th century to now, it is a war crime. But, of 
course, things have now changed so much, and the

13:10.228 --> 13:20.178
attack on civilians, the killing of civilians, 
and the destruction of their houses is now an

13:10.228 --> 13:20.178
accepted part of war. But the thing about it that I 
felt very strongly at the time

13:29.525 --> 13:41.276
Now, to begin today then with fresh questions, 
from the last time we talked, you had in effect

13:29.525 --> 13:41.276
resigned at Toronto and were taking a new 
direction in your career. Well, I came home and I

13:41.397 --> 13:46.301
became the bottom man on the totem pole. An 
eccentric thing to do. I thought at the time I

13:49.184 --> 13:55.110
wanted peace and quiet to get on with my own work. A 
great many scientists, particularly scientists

13:55.478 --> 14:06.353
who had the experience of the war, have oscillated 
between a desire for power and influence and a

13:55.478 --> 14:06.353
desire to do their own work. The outstanding 
example was the treasurer of the National

14:07.334 --> 14:14.023
Academy, Bob Robertson. Bob Robertson was an 
expert on relativity. And Bob Robertson came over

14:18.309 --> 14:24.017
during the war, and I remember telling him, But 
there was no good coming over and talking about new

14:24.638 --> 14:30.246
gadgets he wanted made and all this kind of thing. I 
said, just wasting your time. The war's nearly

14:31.547 --> 14:32.449
over. The only thing that matters is to use what 
we've got and get on with it. And I don't want to talk

14:36.154 --> 14:39.318
about whether you can make a better death charge. 
I'm just not interested. And he got this point and

14:41.040 --> 14:46.728
became an enthusiastic supporter of operations 
analysis. A very successful, very influential

14:47.369 --> 14:49.752
man. talking all the time about how he wanted to get 
back to his relativity at Caltech. Well, the war

14:55.416 --> 14:56.237
ended. He went back to relativity at Caltech. 
Before a year or so was over, he was saying he felt it

14:59.040 --> 15:03.786
wasn't relevant. He felt he ought to be doing 
something useful. Morphy went and became chief

15:06.009 --> 15:09.353
scientist to NATO, I believe. And this cycle was 
repeated several times until eventually he got

15:09.373 --> 15:14.719
killed in a road crash. But this is true of many 
people, this oscillation between positions of

15:19.820 --> 15:33.295
moderate power and influence and positions in 
which you can just deal with graduate students and

15:19.820 --> 15:33.295
try and teach people what the world is like and how 
things work and get on with the things you're

15:19.820 --> 15:33.295
interested in. Well this was one of these switches 
that I decided I could have had various jobs. I was

15:39.402 --> 15:47.491
offered the directorship of the atomic weapons 
establishment in England at the same time and I

15:39.402 --> 15:47.491
refused it. I could have done almost anything I'd 
wanted to do. At the end of the war, I was offered the

15:50.064 --> 15:53.128
job of Chief Scientist of the Air Force. Many, many 
jobs. There was always this choice, and to some

15:56.732 --> 16:03.040
extent, the oscillation between the two things. 
Well, anyway, I went back to Cambridge, and this

16:03.741 --> 16:09.348
has been a success. Somewhere in one of C.P. Snow's 
novels, he has a case of this sort, and says that

16:12.211 --> 16:16.877
he's noticed how often it is successful where 
people like Charles V of Spain, resigning as

16:17.178 --> 16:26.993
emperor and going into a monastery. Snow doesn't 
quote this, but it's another example. It's a

16:29.758 --> 16:38.712
common human thing to do, and I'm sure when Snow 
wrote this, he was thinking of me, because we

16:29.758 --> 16:38.712
talked about it not very long before. Well, 
anyway, I went back to Cambridge to this job, as

16:44.313 --> 16:54.989
assistant director of research with this man, 
Brown, who was a lot younger than me and I'd worked

16:44.313 --> 16:54.989
with as a young man, and he was head of the 
department. And I had to, of course, be frankly

16:55.991 --> 17:02.661
careful not to tread on his toes or to attempt to run 
the department. I had to sit in the background and

17:02.681 --> 17:07.188
let him do what he wanted to do, so to speak. I had 
some difficulty in refraining from getting the

17:10.418 --> 17:14.322
department involved in the International 
Geophysical Year. He wanted, for some reason best

17:14.362 --> 17:19.107
known to himself, to have nothing at all to do with 
the International Geophysical Year. I think he

17:19.668 --> 17:21.089
just thought he'd be a nuisance. He was a rather 
half-hearted geophysicist. He was an awfully

17:26.475 --> 17:32.482
nice man, a very able man, but really fairly 
half-hearted about actually doing any work. He

17:32.502 --> 17:35.525
was, I think, a country gentleman at heart, 
really. And he died of cancer. or about ten years

17:38.903 --> 17:40.525
ago, I suppose. But before that, he decided to 
resign as head of the department. And so I became

17:46.531 --> 17:48.493
head of the department. And at this time, or about 
that time, or a little before, the university had

17:48.513 --> 17:54.560
promoted me to my old grade as reader.

17:57.263 --> 18:04.351
So we both were readers, and I took the job as head of 
the department. And we were, by that time, in quite

18:04.371 --> 18:07.594
a mess. And I went into it with this man called 
Morris Hill, who had been a graduate student with

18:08.283 --> 18:15.630
me after the war, and I'd known him during the war. 
He was the son of A.V. Hill, the Secretary of the

18:17.692 --> 18:26.662
Royal Society, the physiologist, the man who was 
in charge of this committee looking into

18:17.692 --> 18:26.662
scientific manpower that I mentioned yesterday. 
Well, his son was in the lab, and he was getting very

18:26.682 --> 18:34.569
depressed and upset, and I had a long talk with him. 
And I decided that what we lacked was money. So I

18:37.645 --> 18:39.588
said, well, why don't I get some money? So we got a 
lot of money. We got $50,000 a year from the Office

18:41.812 --> 18:47.201
of Naval Research, which was reasonable. It was my 
appreciable money in those days, it isn't now. And

18:50.767 --> 18:52.730
we got money from here and there. And soon we were 
really quite well set up. And we went into the

18:55.775 --> 19:01.344
marine work, marine geology, on quite a scale. We 
had an extensive operation in the Indian Ocean. um

19:05.135 --> 19:32.914
during there was an international um i forget what 
it's called the international indian ocean

19:05.135 --> 19:32.914
expedition there are lots of different 
nationalities sent ships to the indian ocean i

19:05.135 --> 19:32.914
didn't go but a lot of our people went well so that 
when i became head of the department again i went

19:05.135 --> 19:32.914
through a moderate expansion looking back i 
didn't expand it enough i decided that I wanted to

19:33.434 --> 19:36.438
aim at 20 graduate students. So we went up to 20 
graduate students and a staff of about five. We

19:41.363 --> 19:50.074
didn't get any appreciable increase of money from 
the university, but we simply, in fact, the

19:41.363 --> 19:50.074
university money was practically negligible. It 
paid my salary and a couple of other salaries and

19:50.094 --> 19:53.598
nothing much else. And I got the money from all 
kinds of places outside. And then, a little later

19:59.224 --> 20:02.428
on, I saw the writing on the wall that this country 
wasn't going on indefinitely financing Europe,

20:03.168 --> 20:10.898
scientific enterprises in Europe. And when our 
contract with ONR ran out, I decided not to try and

20:11.398 --> 20:16.585
get it renewed. I was sure it was going to go, and I 
wouldn't get it renewed, and so I decided to use the

20:17.326 --> 20:26.918
fact that this wasn't being renewed to put 
pressure to get money from the British

20:17.326 --> 20:26.918
government. So we got quite good contracts, 
grants rather, with the old Department of

20:31.180 --> 20:38.830
Scientific and Industrial Research in England 
and its various successors, the Natural

20:31.180 --> 20:38.830
Environment Research Council. They've been our 
main finance since that. And we've been

20:42.976 --> 20:48.323
adequately financed for the level we were working 
at. I think, looking back, we ought to have aimed at

20:48.623 --> 20:53.910
a 50% higher level. But we didn't really do it. But 
we've had very distinguished people. numerous

21:00.138 --> 21:27.194
fellows of the Royal Society, and we had played a 
very large part in the revolution in geology, the

21:00.138 --> 21:27.194
transition from the idea of fixed continents, no 
global theory, to the ideas of Wegener and the

21:00.138 --> 21:27.194
ideas that you could have a global theory of why the 
Earth worked like it did. Our main theme since I

21:29.855 --> 21:45.632
went back there in, I went back in 56 and I would say 
the main theme of that department in Cambridge

21:29.855 --> 21:45.632
since 58 has been a global view of geology, 
particularly the mechanism of geology as

21:29.855 --> 21:45.632
exemplified in the sea floor.

21:48.295 --> 21:50.838
I should like to ask two questions right here if I 
could. What finally became of the explanation of

21:50.858 --> 21:57.465
low values you found in the Pacific, speaking of 
heat values in the Pacific floor? Did we find those

21:57.749 --> 21:59.391
values? Yes, you did. Well, they were very 
variable. I mean, there are very high values along

22:01.995 --> 22:05.920
the ocean ridge. Right. And there are lower values 
on each side, some of which are exceptionally low.

22:11.308 --> 22:27.250
And the general decrease of heat flow away from the 
ridge is qualitatively well explained by the

22:11.308 --> 22:27.250
ideas of the motion of the sea floor away from the 
axis. It's a somewhat curious situation at the

22:27.854 --> 22:32.480
moment. One gets a very good account of the slope 
from the ridge down on each side. I mean, it's a very

22:40.990 --> 22:49.741
striking feature of the sea floor that the deepest 
places are quite close to the continental edge and

22:40.990 --> 22:49.741
the shallowest places are in the middle. I mean, 
this is not what anyone would expect of an ocean.

22:53.405 --> 22:57.490
And the reason is because new ocean floor is being 
formed, all hot, by volcanoes on the ridge and

22:57.892 --> 23:21.675
these volcanoes keep erupting and it keeps 
splitting open and you're forming new sea floor on

22:57.892 --> 23:21.675
the axis of the ridge and the sea floor on each side 
is moving away and as it goes of course it cools and

22:57.892 --> 23:21.675
contracts and the increased depth of the sea is 
very well accounted for quantitatively by the

22:57.892 --> 23:21.675
cooling. The heat flow is not so good 
quantitatively. Various people, mostly

23:26.512 --> 23:43.155
students of mine, are working on this now, and I was 
talking to Dan McKenzie, who's the brightest man

23:26.512 --> 23:43.155
on this stuff, and he tells me there's a man at MIT, 
an old student of ours, who now has a rational

23:26.512 --> 23:43.155
explanation of this, but I'm afraid I can't 
remember what it is. But you began working with

23:43.175 --> 23:50.865
that, though, with these ideas really in the 50s 
while you were... Well, what I wanted to do, you

23:43.175 --> 23:50.865
see, I was fairly convinced that the Earth's heat 
was the ultimate cause of geological change, that

23:51.453 --> 23:57.781
the Earth is a heat engine. And the question of 
whether the Earth is cooling, whether the Earth is

23:58.141 --> 24:11.136
heating up, how the heat flow varies from place to 
place, was obviously one of the critical things

23:58.141 --> 24:11.136
about the Earth, which wasn't understood, wasn't 
known, hardly. You see, the increase of

24:11.797 --> 24:19.266
temperature in mines was, as far as I know, 
discovered in the middle of the 17th century. You

24:22.964 --> 24:37.924
would think that it would have been known to 
Agricola in the 16th century, and whilst I haven't

24:22.964 --> 24:37.924
read Agricola's enormous works in Latin all the 
way through, I have made a fair search, and it

24:22.964 --> 24:37.924
appears that he doesn't know that it's hot in 
mines. Very surprising, and I don't understand

24:39.526 --> 24:48.358
why, and I want to read some of his obscurer works to 
see whether he really did know, but those are

24:49.013 --> 25:10.005
French

24:49.013 --> 25:10.005
Jesuit theologian, astrologer, scientist of a 
sort in the beginning, somewhere about 1620, the

24:49.013 --> 25:10.005
beginning of the 17th century, who remarks that 
the mines in what's now Czechoslovakia and

24:49.013 --> 25:10.005
Bohemia are hot in them. And there's a beautiful, 
very interesting travel book by Edward Brown, the

25:10.025 --> 25:16.455
son of Brown, who wrote the essays. Brown, what's 
his name? Doesn't really matter. Well-known 17th

25:23.850 --> 25:27.394
century essayist who lived in Norwich, England. 
Well, his son was a doctor who went out to the mines

25:27.414 --> 25:36.066
in Bohemia and gives a very good account of how it 
gets warm as you go down them. And Boyle, he was a

25:36.086 --> 25:47.100
friend of Boyle's, Robert Boyle's, whose joke 
about Boyle that he was the father of chemistry and

25:36.086 --> 25:47.100
the nephew of the Earl of Cork. Well, anyway, he 
wrote about the heat inside the Earth. And then

25:51.893 --> 25:54.236
really no one paid any attention to it. There's 
extraordinarily few references to it from these

25:54.276 --> 26:04.928
very interesting papers of Boyle in about 1660, 
way down until our own times. And then Kelvin got

26:04.988 --> 26:06.529
interested. Kelvin was interested in it in 
connection with the age of the Earth. There's a

26:11.498 --> 26:15.984
very interesting book that's been published by 
Joe Birchfield, who you may know. Joe Birchfield

26:16.384 --> 26:19.068
of Northern Illinois, I think. He wrote a book on 
Kelvin and the age of the Earth. I've written a

26:22.993 --> 26:24.935
review of it, which I will give you. And Kelvin set 
up a committee, a committee of the British

26:25.877 --> 26:33.827
Association, to measure heat flow from the Earth. 
You have to measure not only temperature

26:35.921 --> 26:41.606
gradients, which is relatively easy, but also the 
thermal conductivity of the rocks. And this

26:42.207 --> 26:44.969
committee was very active for 10 or 15 years. And 
then again, the subject died and nothing happened

26:45.530 --> 26:53.777
until Jeffreys suggested to me in the middle 1930s 
that we ought to do something about it. And we

26:54.278 --> 26:56.119
started to do something about it. We developed 
methods of measuring thermal conductivity of

26:56.159 --> 27:03.966
relatively small pieces of rock, methods of 
making the specimens, all this kind of thing. And I

27:06.182 --> 27:15.771
went to South Africa and worked the western 
temperature measurements in boreholes and mines

27:06.182 --> 27:15.771
there, and I collected specimens and measured 
thermal conductivity and so on. And I had students

27:16.232 --> 27:19.355
working in England on it, or one student anyway. 
And so we got well into heat flow on land before the

27:19.876 --> 27:27.023
war, and then after the war decided to do it at sea. 
We had to take cores and measure the thermal

27:27.043 --> 27:31.287
conductivity of the material. Afterwards, 
Morris Ewing at Columbia developed a method in

27:34.591 --> 27:38.736
which you measured the temperatures and took the 
cores at the same time. And this was one of the new

27:41.039 --> 27:48.028
inputs to the whole argument about what's been 
happening on Earth. The critical things, I think,

27:48.149 --> 28:03.248
for the revolution in geological thought were, 
historically, first of all, Wegener, who before

27:48.149 --> 28:03.248
the first war, had very good arguments for the idea 
that the continents had split and moved apart.

28:08.801 --> 28:12.807
Wegener lost out, I think, for two reasons. There 
was tremendous controversy in the 20s about this,

28:13.048 --> 28:18.636
very offensive papers about Wegener. And he lost 
out for two reasons. One, he wasn't a member of the

28:21.521 --> 28:23.604
right trades union. He was a meteorologist, not a 
geologist. Secondly, he mixed up good arguments

28:28.411 --> 28:31.716
with bad. And if you have a difficult case to argue, 
you want to argue on your strong arguments.

28:37.963 --> 28:44.102
Because otherwise people will refute the weak 
ones and think they refuted the whole thing.
