WEBVTT

00:02.495 --> 00:09.403
So you weren't aware of any secret?

00:09.423 --> 00:10.944
A lot of conversations about it.

00:11.565 --> 00:13.747
Speculation about, are they still around?

00:15.790 --> 00:20.435
My freshman year, I wondered if the Corps commander was one of them.

00:21.816 --> 00:23.378
My sophomore year, I wondered.

00:23.398 --> 00:25.620
My junior year, I knew he wasn't because I knew him very well.

00:25.660 --> 00:30.105
In fact, it was Jack Lunsford, our chemistry department.

00:30.345 --> 00:31.827
Of course, I knew Hagler was not.

00:32.482 --> 00:36.283
All right, that sophomore year, Aggie football began to improve.

00:36.947 --> 00:37.751
Yeah.

00:37.771 --> 00:38.998
How did things...

00:39.232 --> 00:42.637
you and the Corps and others, how did that affect y'all?

00:42.797 --> 00:43.798
Well, it was well received.

00:44.018 --> 00:49.986
We began to take some pride in it, and Bear was very much a presence on campus at the time.

00:50.006 --> 00:51.989
What impression did he make on students?

00:52.329 --> 00:54.492
Well, you'd see him at Yale practices.

00:54.532 --> 00:57.877
He would be once or twice at Yale practice or midnight Yale practice.

00:57.897 --> 01:00.901
He would be there and introduce the team and make speech and stuff.

01:00.921 --> 01:02.823
And he was strong.

01:03.144 --> 01:04.806
He could get you committed to it.

01:05.707 --> 01:07.990
One of the things he would do, though,

01:07.970 --> 01:21.164
and I didn't realize this until my junior and senior year, if he had a big game on Saturday and practice wasn't really going the way he thought it should, he would arrange for a spontaneous yell practice.

01:21.204 --> 01:23.907
The way he arranged it was to call up the head yell leader.

01:24.087 --> 01:28.312
Of course, head yell leader was on core staff, so we'd know these things.

01:28.512 --> 01:34.939
He'd say, you need to show up, your guys need to show up at the athletic dorm at 1030 or something like that.

01:35.920 --> 01:37.622
All of a sudden, the whole campus would

01:38.058 --> 01:41.109
fallout for spontaneous yelp practice.

01:41.130 --> 01:42.615
And whatever the bear wanted.

01:42.635 --> 01:44.181
The bear got.

01:44.201 --> 01:45.145
The bear got.

01:46.610 --> 01:48.979
Who was president in those years?

01:49.195 --> 01:53.522
Well, my freshman and sophomore year, Manny Morgan, was president.

01:54.184 --> 01:59.994
He left the university and Tom Harrington, who had been president, was then chancellor, became president again.

02:00.054 --> 02:02.298
He held both jobs.

02:02.318 --> 02:06.164
By January of my senior year, Earl Rudder came as vice president.

02:06.845 --> 02:08.769
I think he was executive vice president.

02:08.789 --> 02:12.435
Everybody knew he was going to be president and he began to act like president.

02:12.415 --> 02:12.936
Really?

02:12.996 --> 02:13.236
Yeah.

02:13.336 --> 02:15.879
So that was, even students were where?

02:15.899 --> 02:18.201
Yeah, that was our perception that he was going to be president.

02:18.261 --> 02:22.786
In fact, I think that was a common understanding at the time.

02:22.806 --> 02:26.770
I don't know if it was in the newspapers even or not, but we met him.

02:26.790 --> 02:28.071
He began to make decisions.

02:28.131 --> 02:30.093
He lived in the president's house.

02:32.015 --> 02:35.639
Harrington lived in where Madeline lives now, which is the whole home of the chancellor.

02:37.461 --> 02:41.545
Do you remember what impression Mr. Rutter made on you at that time?

02:41.744 --> 02:47.732
Yeah, of course, we had read about him and heard about him, and we all heard the stereotype, he's not an academic, and blah, blah, blah.

02:47.772 --> 02:50.956
That was less important to us than it seemed to be to other people.

02:53.039 --> 02:56.684
Being in the Corps, you're always wondering, is the Corps going to die and all that stuff?

02:56.764 --> 03:02.091
And we knew that at that point it was optional, and there was all sorts of paranoia about its future.

03:02.151 --> 03:07.418
There was even a little episode in the courts about letting in women during that time frame.

03:07.438 --> 03:10.182
So we were all curious about his support for the Corps.

03:10.162 --> 03:12.906
And here's this retired general appointed.

03:12.926 --> 03:14.048
We said, well, we got him made.

03:14.128 --> 03:14.969
And then we came in.

03:15.009 --> 03:18.054
He made it pretty clear that he's a university president.

03:18.094 --> 03:19.296
He's not commandant.

03:19.797 --> 03:26.166
And he met with Hagler and me back over in the dorm, too, where we were all located.

03:26.887 --> 03:30.353
And he was pretty strong in making us understand what his expectations were.

03:30.413 --> 03:34.018
And he wasn't automatically going to come out and defend the Corps.

03:34.038 --> 03:36.442
We had to look after ourselves and stuff.

03:36.462 --> 03:37.283
He was impressive.

03:37.263 --> 03:41.069
And was it clear that he planned to take charge?

03:41.349 --> 03:43.592
Yeah, he had that demeanor about him.

03:44.313 --> 03:48.520
Of course, when you're young that way, you're easily impressed by somebody with his background.

03:48.820 --> 03:51.284
Were you all aware about his World War II?

03:52.125 --> 03:54.709
Yeah, that was very common knowledge to all of us.

03:56.491 --> 03:57.733
Back up to Morgan.

03:57.813 --> 04:00.337
Did you all know or see anything?

04:00.758 --> 04:02.460
Did you all have much impression of him?

04:02.575 --> 04:08.552
We saw him, but I didn't have the opportunity to have any up-close conversations with him.

04:08.572 --> 04:11.721
I learned more about him since I've been back than I did then.

04:12.382 --> 04:16.213
Because I've heard that some of his plans

04:16.447 --> 04:20.032
became reality later.

04:20.753 --> 04:21.515
Yeah.

04:21.535 --> 04:23.417
There's a gentleman named Bob Kamm.

04:23.578 --> 04:25.440
Did you encounter Bob Kamm in your life?

04:26.142 --> 04:37.138
Bob, of course, left was a dean here, dean of the basic division or something, I forget his exact title, but he was brought here by Morgan, one of Morgan's chief lieutenants.

04:37.118 --> 04:47.198
And when Morgan left Comm State a couple more years, and then he went to Oklahoma State as the Dean of Arts and Sciences, later became VP for Academic Affairs, then president.

04:48.180 --> 04:52.528
When I became provost up there, I get this letter from Bob Comm saying, I remember you.

04:52.508 --> 04:54.892
I couldn't believe it, but he did.

04:54.932 --> 04:57.535
The man's got a steel trap for a mind.

04:57.555 --> 05:05.527
I was having dinner with him a few weeks before I came back down here, and he started describing for me my roommate my senior year.

05:05.708 --> 05:06.789
I can't remember his name.

05:06.849 --> 05:12.618
He was from LaGrange, and he described his mannerisms and so forth, and he nailed it directly.

05:13.038 --> 05:13.719
Amazing man.

05:14.480 --> 05:18.246
But he described Morgan as a real fine person.

05:18.226 --> 05:25.636
a visionary, had great ideas for the university, was too progressive for A&M at that time.

05:27.118 --> 05:43.660
He also was the early example of the awkwardness of the structure we have here, of a chancellor and a president sitting in the same proximity, neither of which is willing to relinquish running this university to each other.

05:43.640 --> 05:47.126
He told, Morgan told people, I can't get along with this Chancellor.

05:47.166 --> 05:48.829
He's interfering in my business.

05:49.811 --> 05:58.006
And so I think Morgan is, I don't know what happened to him when he left here, but I think he doesn't get credit for some of the ideas.

05:58.607 --> 06:00.831
He, in fact, I think would have brought women here earlier.

06:01.191 --> 06:02.133
That's what I've heard.

06:02.233 --> 06:07.302
He probably would have gotten the Corps in right proportion to its importance earlier.

06:07.282 --> 06:19.020
Not being an Aggie, not having the right chemistry on the board probably made it more difficult.

06:20.883 --> 06:23.487
You had a car your sophomore year.

06:23.527 --> 06:24.649
How did that change life?

06:25.118 --> 06:30.688
It added a lot of flexibility and got me a lot of friends too.

06:31.469 --> 06:34.395
Parking was not good, even for sophomores.

06:34.795 --> 06:35.998
Parking was always a problem.

06:36.198 --> 06:41.828
Freshmen had to park enormously great distance away, and sophomores wasn't much better.

06:42.078 --> 06:47.304
Did y'all already have them nicknamed the Hempstead lot and the Navisota lot?

06:47.344 --> 06:48.205
Yeah, I think so.

06:48.406 --> 06:49.066
I think so.

06:49.086 --> 06:50.408
And what kind of vehicle was this?

06:50.688 --> 06:52.510
Well, mine was a car I wish I had now.

06:52.530 --> 06:54.293
It was a 51 Oldsmobile 88.

06:54.433 --> 06:56.335
It was my mother's car.

06:56.395 --> 06:57.877
This was like 55.

06:58.878 --> 07:00.620
And she bought a new Buick.

07:01.321 --> 07:04.445
And this was a yellow car with black fender skirts.

07:04.805 --> 07:07.268
This thing would attract attention today.

07:07.288 --> 07:09.891
And it had good rear fenders, too.

07:09.871 --> 07:13.841
It had... No, no, those come later.

07:13.921 --> 07:16.788
It didn't have the dramatic fins on it.

07:18.492 --> 07:20.297
It was really a very fast car.

07:20.317 --> 07:24.066
It had a high dramatic transmission in it, which my mother did how to shift gears.

07:24.265 --> 07:28.690
All right, now you're still dating this young lady, and she was where in school?

07:28.710 --> 07:33.577
Well, I met her in high school my freshman year, and then she was at SMU a freshman that next year.

07:33.597 --> 07:35.559
And how often did you go back and forth?

07:35.619 --> 07:36.560
As often as possible.

07:38.443 --> 07:39.484
Really, every weekend.

07:40.465 --> 07:47.033
I forget if sophomores did not have complete freedom the number of times they left, like juniors did, but every chance I did.

07:47.494 --> 07:48.535
Came down from most ballgames.

07:48.785 --> 07:56.898
And was she allowed to, when she came down here for an SMU football game, was she allowed to root for the Mustangs?

07:58.982 --> 08:00.825
She was quiet about that.

08:00.905 --> 08:01.867
I think she really did.

08:01.987 --> 08:04.311
But yeah, I guess she was allowed to.

08:05.813 --> 08:14.708
On athletics, what big games do you remember with greatest joy in the Bryant years?

08:14.873 --> 08:18.998
We had never beaten Texas in Memorial Stadium.

08:19.018 --> 08:22.423
In my junior year, we did, and that was a big deal.

08:23.624 --> 08:25.006
And what did you all do to celebrate?

08:26.948 --> 08:27.309
Partied.

08:27.369 --> 08:35.619
We took over Austin that night, and there were people ripped up grass from Memorial Stadium, and probably some still have it.

08:35.639 --> 08:37.101
It was quite a big deal.

08:37.300 --> 08:41.666
That particular year, we were ranked high in the nation, very high in the nation.

08:41.906 --> 08:43.868
And Brian had gotten us in trouble.

08:43.949 --> 08:48.875
I don't think we, my recollection, I may mix up my years, but I think that was the year we couldn't go to a bowl game.

08:48.955 --> 08:49.976
I think that's right.

08:49.996 --> 08:50.757
I think that's right.

08:51.218 --> 08:57.226
Do you remember any negative out-of-town football experiences?

08:57.967 --> 08:58.387
Oh, yeah.

08:58.407 --> 09:00.810
My senior year, we had a big fight up at TCU.

09:01.551 --> 09:02.272
Oh, really?

09:02.292 --> 09:03.213
Yeah, yeah.

09:03.233 --> 09:03.914
Describe that.

09:04.115 --> 09:04.455
Well, yeah.

09:06.359 --> 09:16.399
What we believed was that the freshman football team at TCU had been told to bring home some souvenirs, and a lot of Aggies lost their hats and some of their boots and their rings and stuff.

09:16.419 --> 09:19.846
And it was kind of an unfortunate situation.

09:19.866 --> 09:21.369
In fact, a lot of it came back.

09:21.449 --> 09:26.078
The university got very aggressive in punishing the perpetrators.

09:26.619 --> 09:27.962
This happened after the game?

09:27.942 --> 09:30.706
after the game, as people were leaving the ball game.

09:31.126 --> 09:39.958
There were these thugs basically out there, jumping people and taking parts of their uniforms, sabers and their rings.

09:41.621 --> 09:45.566
I don't remember other than that anything that particularly comes up.

09:45.606 --> 09:48.550
There were silly things of stealing the Baylor Bears and stuff like that.

09:48.985 --> 10:00.898
During a court trip, march down Main Street, Congress Avenue, and so forth, there never were problems, were there?

10:00.918 --> 10:01.799
None that I recall.

10:02.000 --> 10:06.024
Again, these things are not things I think about a lot.

10:06.945 --> 10:11.230
Two of those years, I was on a court staff, and we went through first, what happened later.

10:11.210 --> 10:14.033
I don't have any recollection of that.

10:14.053 --> 10:28.927
I've never heard anybody mention anything except positive things from court trips and the generosity of people to provide free places to sleep and things like that.

10:29.647 --> 10:34.352
Now, so on a Dallas or Fort Worth court trip, you always had a date.

10:36.754 --> 10:38.736
The

10:38.716 --> 10:44.504
Where did your buddies, where did they locate dates if they didn't have a... Well, we'd try to get them dates.

10:44.544 --> 10:47.729
Like my girlfriend would get them dates.

10:48.470 --> 10:54.118
You know, like, you know, she went to... I met her when she was a senior in high school.

10:54.819 --> 10:58.745
Probably every girl in her class had the opportunity to date an Aggie.

10:59.686 --> 11:02.310
And there was just a network that developed out of that.

11:02.864 --> 11:04.787
Now, did the Tessies come down?

11:04.807 --> 11:07.151
To a degree.

11:07.492 --> 11:12.401
I get the impression that wasn't as much of a traffic as it might have been in different generations.

11:12.901 --> 11:18.451
But, you know, in those days, the homecoming queen was a Tessie, and that still was going on.

11:19.553 --> 11:23.640
In some years, I've heard about either a train load or two or three bus loads.

11:23.755 --> 11:26.460
There may have been, but I don't remember that happening.

11:27.222 --> 11:36.540
I think by the time I came along, there were enough cars, and the trains were less reliable, and I think there was a different way of doing it.

11:36.880 --> 11:39.044
The generation before, trains were more important.

11:39.064 --> 11:40.988
How was the homecoming queen selected?

11:40.968 --> 11:45.574
I think there were just nominations, photographs, interviews.

11:45.614 --> 11:47.676
The MSC folks I think did it.

11:48.016 --> 11:49.779
I was never involved in it.

11:50.279 --> 11:54.464
You as a corps leader did not go up there on any... I think Hagler did.

11:54.484 --> 11:59.891
I think as corps commander, I think he was the escort of the homecoming queen.

11:59.911 --> 12:02.554
In fact, he was...

12:02.534 --> 12:11.887
very close to his girlfriend then, the lady who's now his wife, that he got married his senior year, early in the second semester.

12:12.728 --> 12:19.497
And I recall some tension over the idea he was escorting this homecoming queen.

12:21.079 --> 12:24.363
And it was duty versus country, so to speak.

12:25.244 --> 12:26.706
I do see some humor in that.

12:26.827 --> 12:27.347
That's good.

12:27.387 --> 12:31.613
The...

12:32.960 --> 12:35.426
No, we've already done that.

12:35.486 --> 12:39.556
Where would they go on dates?

12:41.581 --> 12:47.695
Did you ever have a summer job that was profession-oriented?

12:48.552 --> 12:49.694
I had a number of them.

12:49.714 --> 12:58.806
At the end of my sophomore year, I went to work for Southwestern Bell, my brother's influence.

12:58.846 --> 13:00.248
I worked for them for two summers.

13:01.010 --> 13:02.011
Doing what?

13:02.472 --> 13:04.414
It's kind of a junior engineer kind of job.

13:04.474 --> 13:05.796
In Dallas?

13:06.177 --> 13:07.959
In Dallas, yeah.

13:09.161 --> 13:12.045
With my 17 years on that board,

13:12.025 --> 13:14.759
Pounding in my heart great gratitude.

13:15.503 --> 13:15.865
What was it?

13:16.308 --> 13:19.605
What kind of well company did it seem to be I?

13:21.070 --> 13:26.617
To be perfectly honest with you, it didn't seem very dynamic and exciting, extremely conservative, very cautious.

13:26.657 --> 13:36.530
Of course, at that point, they were a real public utility, totally regulated, and they were very much what appeared to me to be a public utility attitude.

13:36.570 --> 13:40.896
But it's unfair for me and the situation I was in to assess that.

13:40.916 --> 13:43.299
I met some good people, and they were kind to me.

13:43.900 --> 13:49.187
You see, I saw it as AT&T is broken up.

13:49.775 --> 13:53.823
Before then, our headquarters was in St.

13:53.843 --> 13:55.246
Louis.

13:55.266 --> 13:57.912
We were to bring our wives, always.

13:59.114 --> 14:03.784
We would have social events beginning at 5 o'clock on Friday evening.

14:04.422 --> 14:08.790
Line sometimes was flown from Paris, France that day.

14:10.232 --> 14:12.977
We would have an elegant, elegant dinner.

14:13.619 --> 14:20.711
Then there was almost a free gift at every meeting of considerable cost.

14:20.731 --> 14:24.979
Then the next morning, while we were meeting, our wives were taken...

14:25.820 --> 14:30.927
maybe to a Neiman's-like fashion show or something.

14:31.568 --> 14:40.440
Well, as soon as that break comes and Ed Whitaker takes over, all of that stops because he says the public will not stand for that.

14:41.602 --> 14:44.065
Until then, every

14:44.045 --> 14:46.310
corporate official in St.

14:46.330 --> 14:50.980
Louis had a chauffeur-driven limo every day back and forth.

14:51.020 --> 14:51.821
He said, no more.

14:52.362 --> 15:02.644
We will provide a chauffeur-driven vehicle for you when you are going to represent this corporation at a social event where alcoholic beverages are served,

15:02.624 --> 15:09.153
So there'll be no hand that you had maybe had too many drinks.

15:09.433 --> 15:15.141
And so there was a complete turnaround like that.

15:16.543 --> 15:24.193
Let's see, the Corps did not have any sharp changes during those four years, did it?

15:24.612 --> 15:30.218
Only the management of this optional situation was not required.

15:30.999 --> 15:34.262
You know, my freshman year was the first year that it was not required.

15:35.323 --> 15:40.529
And managing that, I'm sure, created some special problems at the time.

15:40.729 --> 15:40.929
All right.

15:40.949 --> 15:42.431
Who was the commandant in those days?

15:42.891 --> 15:44.012
A man named Joe Davis.

15:44.473 --> 15:47.376
In fact, I didn't realize he was still alive.

15:47.436 --> 15:48.517
He died this last year.

15:48.557 --> 15:50.539
He lived up at Tarleton.

15:50.739 --> 15:53.202
Please describe him as you knew him.

15:54.397 --> 15:57.364
He was not a regular Army officer.

15:57.464 --> 15:59.609
He was in the Texas Guard, I think.

16:01.233 --> 16:04.862
I found him straightforward and kind of tough.

16:06.428 --> 16:14.040
Not a warm, friendly person in the sense that you might think of someone that was interested in you personally and supportive of you.

16:14.060 --> 16:15.482
He was very businesslike.

16:16.063 --> 16:18.026
He had a guy named Wilkins.

16:18.146 --> 16:20.771
Taylor Wilkins was his assistant commandant.

16:21.532 --> 16:23.214
He was the guy we dealt with all the time.

16:23.275 --> 16:27.000
More of a warm person, but tough.

16:27.121 --> 16:29.905
You didn't cross the line with him.

16:29.885 --> 16:33.193
And he was a guy that I would see as kind of the mentor of the two.

16:34.095 --> 16:37.402
Davis was a little more remote, a little more difficult to reach.

16:38.004 --> 16:41.692
Of course, even in 1954, he seemed quite elderly to me.

16:43.356 --> 16:45.220
But Wilkins was the one you all worked with.

16:45.240 --> 16:47.826
Wilkins was a guy we dealt with on a daily basis.

16:48.110 --> 16:58.788
When you're a junior on core staff, somebody from one of that set of people had to be in Wilkins office every day to sort of deal with things they want us to do.

16:58.808 --> 17:00.652
Was there a dean of students then?

17:01.954 --> 17:04.058
Hannigan would have that time.

17:04.078 --> 17:05.280
Hannigan came a little later.

17:05.781 --> 17:06.642
I know it.

17:08.157 --> 17:16.365
There was a guy named Penberthy who associated here with intramurals and stuff, but he was more like a dean of students person.

17:16.766 --> 17:21.531
So he's between Comm and... Well, Comm wasn't really dean of students.

17:22.472 --> 17:28.738
Comm was an academic dean, more like a dean of academic affairs, dean of the basic division or something like that.

17:30.039 --> 17:33.743
My recollection, Comm was an academic person.

17:33.993 --> 17:37.380
As far as you were aware, to whom did Davis report?

17:38.723 --> 17:40.688
I thought he reported to the president.

17:40.708 --> 17:41.108
I don't know.

17:41.128 --> 17:42.692
I think he probably did.

17:42.812 --> 17:44.536
And their offices were in the Trigon.

17:44.656 --> 17:45.358
Yeah, definitely.

17:46.380 --> 17:49.707
During your four years, did the core numbers change?

17:49.906 --> 17:53.191
Not much, and the enrollment didn't change much.

17:53.732 --> 18:03.828
There were probably more people my freshman year than there were my senior year because the wave of the Korean people and so forth had passed out pretty fast.

18:04.610 --> 18:06.753
Well, we didn't worry about it any much.

18:06.813 --> 18:12.302
I now know that everybody was worried desperately we weren't growing the same way that UT was growing, for example.

18:14.037 --> 18:18.824
When did you even have an ambition to be on Corps staff?

18:19.806 --> 18:23.452
In almost all my life.

18:23.552 --> 18:27.378
I've never sort of looked at things like that and lusted after them.

18:28.059 --> 18:31.804
My freshman year, I was in the same dorm with Corps staff, so I knew all about it.

18:33.106 --> 18:34.028
They were dorm 12.

18:34.068 --> 18:40.618
They eventually moved to dorm 2, but I knew of it and who the people were and so forth and so on.

18:40.598 --> 18:44.323
I thought I'd probably be a first sergeant and stuff like that.

18:45.905 --> 18:50.070
Jack Lunsford, who eventually became the Corps commander, was from my same outfit.

18:50.751 --> 18:53.755
So his sophomore year, he pays me.

18:53.775 --> 18:55.397
His junior year, he's on Corps staff.

18:56.098 --> 18:57.420
So I know him and he's there.

18:57.460 --> 19:02.025
Then he's selected as sergeant major and then cadet colonel of the Corps.

19:02.626 --> 19:07.973
So I think he knew me and probably that had some influence in the selection process.

19:08.813 --> 19:13.401
When did you become aware that you might be on this track, whether you wanted to be or not?

19:13.982 --> 19:17.708
I think it was probably the second semester of my sophomore year.

19:18.189 --> 19:25.221
At that point, my academics were really getting quite good, and I was getting some recognition within the Corps.

19:28.607 --> 19:30.571
What confirmation?

19:30.691 --> 19:33.015
How did somebody inform you?

19:33.434 --> 19:37.620
Well, they had an interview process then, which I think they made something similar now.

19:38.221 --> 19:47.755
But you're interviewed by the juniors on core staff, rising seniors, and how you conducted yourself in that interview was basically it.

19:48.175 --> 19:49.657
They decided who they invited.

19:49.678 --> 19:52.101
What kinds of questions were there?

19:52.840 --> 19:54.643
chicken kind of questions, you know.

19:54.663 --> 20:03.299
They'd ask you public affairs kind of issues, stuff in the newspapers, current events kinds of things.

20:04.321 --> 20:07.947
They would ask you how you deal with hypothetical situations.

20:07.927 --> 20:15.681
Back in the context of one of your earlier questions, I can remember Lunsford tossing out on the table, he says, what do you think of this?

20:15.821 --> 20:18.646
I picked it up and it was a TT card.

20:19.969 --> 20:21.632
He'd gotten out of the archive somewhere.

20:22.373 --> 20:28.905
The idea was to make me think for a moment all these guys were in this secret organization.

20:28.885 --> 20:34.333
Were there any questions you recall that were clearly inappropriate?

20:34.593 --> 20:34.794
No.

20:36.256 --> 20:41.623
As far as you think back on it, was the interview real?

20:42.905 --> 20:45.008
That is, they hadn't made the decision in advance.

20:45.048 --> 20:46.891
No, I think the interview was real.

20:46.911 --> 20:49.595
Do you have any idea how many others were interviewed?

20:49.635 --> 20:52.179
Well, I think there were about five of us on core staff.

20:52.559 --> 20:56.144
It was much smaller then than it is now.

20:56.866 --> 20:58.588
They probably interviewed 10 or 15 people.

20:58.720 --> 21:00.962
So the odds were two or three to one.

21:01.203 --> 21:01.943
Yeah, yeah.

21:01.963 --> 21:04.726
For example, I didn't get on immediately.

21:05.967 --> 21:16.659
About a week after they made the selection, one of the guys announced he was getting married, a guy named Don Loomis, who I've seen since that time, and went to Harvard like a lot of those guys did.

21:16.679 --> 21:19.962
And I was kind of the first alternate, and I got on the first day.

21:20.603 --> 21:23.486
And how were you informed that you had been selected?

21:23.626 --> 21:25.808
Launchford sent a message over to come see me.

21:26.665 --> 21:28.006
And then he told you a word about it.

21:28.026 --> 21:29.327
Yeah, he told me a word about it.

21:29.468 --> 21:30.829
Shocked me, surprised me.

21:30.949 --> 21:33.451
And this is near the end of your sophomore year.

21:33.471 --> 21:34.092
Sophomore year, yeah.

21:34.112 --> 21:36.073
Late in the spring of my sophomore year.

21:36.093 --> 21:40.097
And then you and Hegler began to room together.

21:40.497 --> 21:41.098
The next year.

21:41.258 --> 21:41.939
The next year, yeah.

21:42.880 --> 21:49.526
When we came here for Fish Week, that's when we moved in together.

21:49.626 --> 21:56.672
And basically, core staff and the core leadership had to manage that orientation with that next set of freshmen.

21:56.652 --> 22:08.592
And it was, as far as anyone knew, quite clear that future Corps commanders would probably come from this.

22:08.732 --> 22:09.694
Absolutely.

22:09.714 --> 22:13.721
The idea that they would go outside of that set of people was revolutionary.

22:14.382 --> 22:18.829
It was predetermined that one of those five, if that was the right number, would be Corps commanders.

22:18.978 --> 22:25.991
And in your era, was there a mix of Army and Air Force?

22:26.011 --> 22:27.493
In fact, it may have been six.

22:27.554 --> 22:28.776
It may have been three and three.

22:30.178 --> 22:32.563
Were you aware of any token appointments of any sort?

22:34.145 --> 22:38.153
The head yell leader was seen by most as a token appointment.

22:38.173 --> 22:42.741
There was always somebody from the athletic department.

22:44.729 --> 22:50.117
Somebody from the athletic unit was a token corps commander, a token corps staff person.

22:50.137 --> 22:50.538
Oh really?

22:50.558 --> 22:51.860
Yeah.

22:52.802 --> 23:10.990
And we had a guy from, that was a day student, but I think that was, there was an interesting guy that was actually in the class of 57, but he laid out a year and was very close to some people on corps staff that was around our junior year as a junior.

23:10.970 --> 23:16.095
Describe the life, the routine, then, of a Corps junior on Corps staff.

23:16.115 --> 23:19.358
Well, you did all the work, an enormous amount of work.

23:19.578 --> 23:20.378
What did it include?

23:20.579 --> 23:22.480
Well, you had an assignment.

23:22.500 --> 23:26.244
Like, I was the intelligence sergeant, which is kind of a funny name.

23:26.284 --> 23:37.674
And there was a senior that was the Corps intelligence officer, and I basically did all his work for him and looked forward to the time I'd be a senior and had somebody do my work for me.

23:37.694 --> 23:40.977
To give you an example, his job was cadet court.

23:41.412 --> 23:42.553
He was responsible.

23:42.873 --> 23:49.299
And this was a very important kind of self-governance process, disciplinary procedure.

23:49.319 --> 23:59.129
And the sergeant really had to keep all the records, court records, and maintain those and produce those in case there were appeals and things like that.

23:59.169 --> 24:03.373
So it turned out to be a fairly large responsibility.

24:03.393 --> 24:05.435
Of course, you didn't have convenient tape recorders.

24:05.515 --> 24:08.378
You didn't have word processors and things.

24:08.398 --> 24:10.980
So the physical delivery of that

24:10.960 --> 24:13.683
record was very burdensome.

24:14.965 --> 24:23.315
You also took turns being sergeant major because they had not picked the selection of sergeant major and met your corps commander.

24:23.616 --> 24:24.937
So that was done late in the year.

24:25.758 --> 24:29.323
So maybe for six weeks or so you would be the sergeant major.

24:30.144 --> 24:36.732
And your job was to show up in Colonel Moken's office sometime that morning to get your orders for the rest of the day.

24:37.201 --> 24:43.048
And about how many hours per week did... Oh, it was enormous.

24:43.128 --> 24:44.589
Probably 30 hours a week.

24:44.690 --> 24:48.574
You were doing something relating to that responsibility.

24:48.674 --> 24:52.338
And you had to somehow do your academics and go to class.

24:52.378 --> 24:55.562
It was a good exercise in time management.

24:55.582 --> 24:59.466
And the other members of the Corps staff had similar time commitments?

24:59.486 --> 24:59.847
Absolutely.

24:59.867 --> 25:02.290
Everybody worked like Trojans.

25:02.730 --> 25:05.794
That year, what was John Hagler's task?

25:05.814 --> 25:06.094
Well...

25:07.795 --> 25:08.856
I forget.

25:09.116 --> 25:12.300
I'm not sure exactly what his assignment was.

25:13.421 --> 25:15.203
And the Corps commander your junior year?

25:15.623 --> 25:19.748
It was Jack Lunsford, Professor of Chemistry.

25:20.028 --> 25:23.692
Jack Lunsford, distinguished professor of chemistry.

25:24.292 --> 25:31.440
Were there any big unusual events during that junior year that a Corps leader needed to be?

25:32.753 --> 25:34.900
Oh, it was actually a pretty quiet year.

25:34.940 --> 25:39.877
You had the usual kind of good bull events where you'd make the commandant mad.

25:41.221 --> 25:42.325
What would that be?

25:42.558 --> 25:48.268
Well, both my junior and senior year, the reveille we had that time was ill-mannered.

25:49.270 --> 25:52.916
The protocol in those days, she was trained to march in front of the band.

25:52.936 --> 25:59.708
When the band came on the field for 30 seconds or so, she would prance out in front like she was trained to do, but usually distracted.

26:00.169 --> 26:06.220
And then she would run to the sidelines, bite people, officials, anybody that had to be out there.

26:06.200 --> 26:11.014
And in her excitement, she'd typically defecate on Kyle Field.

26:11.837 --> 26:18.115
And then Monday morning, the president would call up as mad as everything about, can't you guys control that dog?

26:18.135 --> 26:19.399
You know, this is embarrassing.

26:19.733 --> 26:22.436
Of course, when she did it, the Corps would stand up and yell.

26:23.457 --> 26:26.841
There was even gambling going on about where she might leave it.

26:28.843 --> 26:32.487
I'll never forget my senior year, there was a guy named Rat Ray.

26:32.548 --> 26:35.090
He's actually worked for the Atlanta Falcons now.

26:35.671 --> 26:38.254
He's been a trainer in the NFL for years and years.

26:38.895 --> 26:44.081
He had to come out and pick it up because the players were going to come out and play the second half.

26:44.241 --> 26:46.163
This was not what you wanted to leave out there.

26:46.784 --> 26:49.949
And we gave him unbelievable trouble about that.

26:50.370 --> 26:56.821
He was out there with the entire Corps Cadets on his feet, giving him a hard time because he's removing the stuff.

26:57.923 --> 27:02.430
And I saw him a couple years ago, and he remembers that very clearly.

27:02.410 --> 27:10.162
Let's see, and no problems, no tragedies during that junior year.

27:10.843 --> 27:12.525
None that come to mind right now.

27:12.545 --> 27:16.591
No, but I mean like the death of the... Nothing comparable to that.

27:16.611 --> 27:19.896
And bonfire was going routinely.

27:19.876 --> 27:25.265
Well, bonfire was going routinely, but my senior year it fell down.

27:26.106 --> 27:30.794
It was one of the times in history that it fell, I guess three times that we were conscious of.

27:30.854 --> 27:32.136
It was over behind Duncan.

27:32.356 --> 27:33.458
Yeah, nobody was on it.

27:33.518 --> 27:36.503
It fell early Sunday morning, and no harm.

27:36.523 --> 27:39.929
It was shoved back up in a short period of time.

27:40.610 --> 27:46.840
And during your four years, all four years, it was teepee style, one log high.

27:46.880 --> 27:46.980
Yeah.

27:47.433 --> 27:51.339
The only thing unusual was that there was finally some mechanization brought in.

27:51.359 --> 27:59.371
I think my senior year, there was a freshman who was academically having the worst time.

27:59.811 --> 28:06.601
The poor guy was just really struggling, but he happened to own a front loader, and he was very popular.

28:06.641 --> 28:16.596
The Yale leaders found him and protected him, and he sort of broke the paradigm out there of the only people getting near the stack were the upperclassmen.

28:17.453 --> 28:20.275
Before that, how were the logs stood up?

28:21.402 --> 28:22.764
In a very dangerous way.

28:22.804 --> 28:26.049
They had these big long sticks with a fork on the end of them.

28:26.069 --> 28:31.778
And the kids would pick them up and you'd get the fork under them and basically walk them up and then drop them over.

28:32.038 --> 28:34.862
Didn't use a rope to pull them up.

28:34.882 --> 28:37.727
And the center pole was stuck in the ground.

28:38.468 --> 28:41.793
And it was no taller than necessary.

28:42.233 --> 28:42.594
That's right.

28:42.614 --> 28:45.238
To hold the outhouse on top.

28:45.258 --> 28:47.882
And the outhouse in those days was an outhouse.

28:48.402 --> 28:50.604
And how was it procured?

28:51.606 --> 28:52.246
Improperly.

28:53.167 --> 28:54.189
You know the story.

28:54.209 --> 28:55.810
People would go out and steal one.

28:56.992 --> 28:59.535
And then the president would get a call.

28:59.595 --> 29:08.525
I presume he'd act shocked that we'd do such a thing and probably hunt it, but discovered to discover later that it had been burned up.

29:08.545 --> 29:10.647
What I was told by one man...

29:11.251 --> 29:15.777
who married one of the, what's the family that owns the land at the Northgate?

29:16.919 --> 29:17.420
Yeah, I don't know.

29:18.281 --> 29:19.643
They still own much of the real estate.

29:19.723 --> 29:22.246
Anyway, this would have been about 1928.

29:22.326 --> 29:22.507
Culpeper?

29:23.208 --> 29:24.990
No, not Culpeper.

29:25.010 --> 29:27.033
They owned down that way.

29:27.093 --> 29:39.891
Anyway, he said during that era that if you wanted a new outhouse, you secretly made the Corps aware to come steal yours, and you complained to the president,

29:39.871 --> 29:42.836
He paid for your new one, and you got a better outhouse.

29:42.856 --> 29:46.062
Well, that's a degree of sophistication I didn't know about.

29:46.082 --> 29:49.048
And he said that that was the way they got it.

29:49.248 --> 29:53.135
Now, was there a special outfit that was to get the outhouse?

29:53.155 --> 29:56.461
Yeah, I think it was the jocks, but don't quote me on that.

29:56.481 --> 29:57.002
I'm not sure.

29:57.042 --> 29:57.984
You probably know.

29:58.004 --> 29:58.645
No, I don't know.

29:58.665 --> 30:02.031
But I think there was one unit whose job was to get the outhouse.

30:02.281 --> 30:05.771
And it was always painted orange in some way.

30:05.831 --> 30:11.346
Decorated in a disgusting way about UT.

30:13.621 --> 30:14.562
Let's see.

30:14.582 --> 30:21.833
And throughout your four years, silver taps would have been held comparatively infrequently.

30:21.853 --> 30:22.814
Yes, definitely.

30:22.834 --> 30:26.219
Because of the fewer, smaller student body.

30:26.239 --> 30:33.689
Smaller student body, fewer cars, less high-speed driving, highways wouldn't support it.

30:33.849 --> 30:37.114
Just the nature of the taps.

30:37.381 --> 30:45.897
Do you remember any indication of anything other than respect for silver taps?

30:46.317 --> 30:47.359
I've never heard of any.

30:48.201 --> 30:50.044
And it was held at exactly the same way?

30:50.064 --> 30:53.230
Exactly the same place, exactly the same protocol.

30:53.210 --> 30:58.140
The only change I saw when I came back was the discipline about lights.

30:58.320 --> 31:01.647
When you go back to the door now, you see the lights coming back on.

31:02.469 --> 31:07.740
But in the old days, the campus, the total campus was totally blanked out.

31:08.160 --> 31:09.744
It stayed that way the next time.

31:10.465 --> 31:12.349
Student intelligences in Utah.
