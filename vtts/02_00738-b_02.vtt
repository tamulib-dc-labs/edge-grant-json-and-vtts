00:03.052 --> 00:04.414
That's good. What Ray's salary was when he came? 
Yeah, how much was he making when he came here in

00:06.436 --> 00:08.538
1925? Right here, you mean about the college 
people were a little bit standoffish about the

00:08.558 --> 00:15.806
Brian. And of course, it has its roots in this, that 
Brian was business. And business was commercial.

00:22.894 --> 00:25.958
And business was making money perfectly 
properly. And I don't know that I was ever gouged in

00:29.275 --> 00:38.965
any sales or anything like that or not treated 
nicely or so on. I think we came here at 2,400. Yes,

00:43.270 --> 00:52.099
because Austin College, you were getting 1,800, 
which was a big salary. And he raised you then to

00:52.639 --> 00:59.046
2,000 after a year or two. And because they had 
offers. By the way, a properly raised and proper

01:01.353 --> 01:14.951
degree is from a proper institution, a man, 
whether a master's, but especially a PhD. They do

01:15.331 --> 01:18.435
not go seeking positions. Not in those days. 
Nowadays, they do not only seek them, they

01:20.197 --> 01:24.022
scramble for them. Because there are so many PhDs. 
You don't. We didn't do that in those days. We

01:29.862 --> 01:31.023
waited for offers. It's now a buyer's market.

01:35.249 --> 01:37.111
Well, I don't know that it was that. It is now, not 
then. It was a feeling of dignity, the same as

01:38.392 --> 01:45.481
doctors do not advertise. And we have a doctor 
friend up in Virginia who advertised. with a

01:52.992 --> 01:56.656
picture taken of himself and wife and five 
children. We know the wife particularly well up in

01:56.676 --> 02:00.981
Lynchburg, Virginia. And that was put in the 
paper. And the Medical Association

02:05.467 --> 02:15.078
sort of protested, because that might look as an 
advertisement. And you know, or advertisement, I

02:15.098 --> 02:20.164
don't know which way you want to pronounce it. We 
change in pronunciations, too, I think. And for

02:23.939 --> 02:32.472
instance, you never see anything about the doctor 
or his practice. The only thing you see is that

02:32.752 --> 02:41.044
doctor or doctor so-and-so are pleased to 
announce the association of so-and-so. Or they

02:42.366 --> 02:48.936
may say location doctor so-and-so has moved his 
office or clinic to such and such a place, which is

02:49.220 --> 02:54.647
for the convenience of people and not 
advertising. And that's the way Ray never sought

02:54.967 --> 02:58.712
any place. Of course, he went to Austin College 
because of the friendship of two family friends.

03:07.043 --> 03:14.212
Do you remember what they were paying your 
professors in the department who worked for you or

03:07.043 --> 03:14.212
your instructors? Do you remember what the salary 
scale was? Here, I think we came to 2,400, and we

03:18.127 --> 03:21.591
thought that was enormous. But, oh, it would be 
maybe 1,800 the way we left Austin College. But it

03:30.240 --> 03:31.281
was plenty. You know, you could buy much more. 
Right in my head, the cigar got about 2,000.

03:37.267 --> 03:38.208
Uh-huh. And he was the one that was here. I signed 
many pills, but I can't remember now what was on

03:40.290 --> 03:45.536
them. No, or what you offered those who came after 
you, the only thing, the only way you could get that

03:48.063 --> 03:57.615
would be to ask, um, ask, um... Probably have to go 
to the comptroller. No, you could, yes, the

03:59.838 --> 04:05.906
comptroller probably would know from the 
records, but he'd have to look pretty far back. But

04:06.166 --> 04:10.932
you could ask the, um, Horace Bassett, I'm sure 
he'd be glad to tell you. Okay. And I think you could

04:11.933 --> 04:14.897
ask, um, Al B. Nelson, who lived out college way 
out. He came here about 35 or 36, I think, didn't he?

04:23.142 --> 04:24.403
Hard to remember. Wait a minute now. This would be 
something like that. The Fullers came seven years

04:26.546 --> 04:29.710
after. The Fullers and Dean.

04:37.580 --> 04:38.801
Who succeeded Dean? Not Della Plain. Who was 
before that? Brooks. That was seven years after we

04:42.316 --> 04:46.662
came. They came, and that's when J.D.P. Fuller 
came, who later went to the VMI, Virginia

04:52.271 --> 04:59.741
Military.

05:04.849 --> 05:07.733
Let me think.

05:11.189 --> 05:18.896
I can't remember what you offered him or what he 
came for, but that was seven years after we came.

05:19.436 --> 05:30.326
And I remember telling Mrs. Brooks, he came in 
seven years after we came. I remember that

05:30.366 --> 05:32.888
particularly by something I said. I said, Mrs. 
Brooks, you know, if you stay here, there's a bug

05:32.908 --> 05:39.694
that bites you. And she said, what's that? I said, 
well, it's a bug that makes you want to stay here.

05:46.460 --> 05:55.632
And if you stay here seven years, you will be 
absolutely captured by that bug. And she said, how

05:55.652 --> 05:57.575
long have you been here? I said, seven years. So I 
remember that they came then. He was mayor of Waco

06:01.060 --> 06:06.026
when he came. So that's seven years. That was in 
1932 then. You see, that's pretty far back. And he

06:12.091 --> 06:14.994
was mayor of Waco. And was he a professor? Yes, he 
was a professor. He was Dr. Brooks. He was a

06:20.279 --> 06:25.264
professor in school and college administration. 
And that's what Dean Friley took up in Chicago. And

06:29.909 --> 06:36.135
we spent part of the summer up in Chicago at a 
friend's home who was going to be gone. We went to

06:36.475 --> 06:38.217
the seaside for the children. Lake Michigan, and 
they all got earrings. And they were bathing in

06:41.318 --> 06:46.365
Lake Michigan. And he went up there to, that was 
Dean Friley. He went up there to get a degree. I

06:54.355 --> 06:59.322
think he had a doctor's degree, but maybe he just 
went up there with that doctor's degree. He was the

06:59.342 --> 07:04.088
one that wanted doctors here in this, because 
there were so few. There was Humbert, and Sylvie,

07:04.148 --> 07:07.512
and Milsing, and Sonny. And it seems to me there 
were six PhDs at the time that we came. But it may

07:14.735 --> 07:16.018
have been 10. I can't remember, because that 
surprised me. That's one of the surprises. Well, I

07:20.648 --> 07:24.598
think you've sort of picked our brains 
thoroughly. I don't know if there's any brains

07:24.678 --> 07:26.462
left now.

07:31.454 --> 07:32.996
was positioned to care of the boys. They are 
cadets. We used to call them cadets, or the boys.

07:38.002 --> 07:42.126
And in fact, I think we said the boys more than 
anything else. He was allowed on the side some

07:42.407 --> 07:45.350
life. I remember one woman here, their young son, 
who was Jimmy Cashin, he was just a little fellow.

07:57.464 --> 08:00.988
And he was born right here on the campus. And they 
would ask him just to get him to make us laugh,

08:03.263 --> 08:14.304
though he didn't know why it was funny. They'd say, 
what do the boys say? Notice the word boys. And he

08:19.582 --> 08:24.011
would say, rah, rah, rah, rah, rah, rah, rah, rah, 
rah, rah, like that. So you see, we called it boys.

08:26.236 --> 08:30.745
And they lived near Dr. Marsh, who was college 
physician when we came. And I think he came perhaps

08:30.785 --> 08:37.860
the same year as he has a son who is James. Jack 
Marsh, a physician, but Dr. Marsh has died. He

08:42.503 --> 08:58.903
looked after the cadets or the boys and was really a 
specialist in respiratory diseases, which was

08:42.503 --> 08:58.903
the commonplace thing here, though he did operate 
minor things like appendicitis and so on. And I

08:58.883 --> 09:04.611
think one Houston friend told me that this was 
called the appendicitis belt. That didn't mean

09:05.032 --> 09:08.577
just the college, but it meant the town too. And so a 
good many went for specialties, went to Houston,

09:09.358 --> 09:17.430
as we did. We had no pediatrician. and no 
ophthalmologist. In fact, Dr. Rolstrom was the

09:24.740 --> 09:31.687
first ophthalmologist down in Beague, Houston, 
which was Beague even then. So we would go down

09:32.148 --> 09:34.570
there, and others would go there. They would take 
their children down to checkups if they were

09:34.610 --> 09:39.796
worried in any way. And I think where they went to, 
oh, I can't remember the name. We took our son

09:46.223 --> 09:48.786
there, both of them. for a checkup, and everything 
was all right. And we took for eyes. You see, we were

09:52.343 --> 09:54.125
great readers. And we had a nearsighted son, and a 
son who was operated on his eyes. So we had to go to

09:59.691 --> 10:01.593
Houston for things like that. And that's all I 
think we went to. There were other specialists,

10:05.057 --> 10:07.980
but we didn't need specialists. And people went to 
Temple for medical, Scott and White. And some went

10:13.426 --> 10:18.351
up here to right north of us, Marlin, I believe 
there's a clinic up there. And Temple, though, was

10:22.544 --> 10:26.949
Dr. Marsh's recommendation. I remember Ray went 
out to Temple. I don't remember that. Oh, Ray, that

10:31.153 --> 10:35.498
was in 29, because of when your father was sick. Dr. 
Marsh recommended a general checkup up at Scott

10:36.479 --> 10:41.785
and White. So you see, we just had to go away for 
special things. And Dr. Marsh was a very kindly,

10:46.951 --> 11:00.792
friendly, would tell you things, and

10:46.951 --> 11:00.792
very likable, very likable. He was also his widow. 
And Jack was a nice kid. Jack went on a trip to

11:08.884 --> 11:14.612
Europe.

11:15.149 --> 11:23.042
when Sam Ray was a political officer in the State 
Department. And when they had free time, he took

11:23.643 --> 11:30.235
off time to go to see Sam Ray up there. And Mrs. Marsh 
told me that Jack said that, oh, Sam Ray, he is

11:31.236 --> 11:38.168
important. And I said, no, he isn't. He's just 
progressed, but I wouldn't say that it was topped.

11:46.183 --> 11:56.393
But it seemed so, because he had crimson satin 
walls, you see, and could look over. The embassy

11:56.493 --> 12:07.363
was a beautiful, restored palace, the Pallas 
Margarita, I think it was, in Rome. And I said to

12:07.917 --> 12:12.322
Mrs. Marsh, but she was so kind to tell me that. And I 
said, no, he's not important. He's not important

12:15.645 --> 12:17.086
to his friend. Oh, no, she says, but I'm in the 
department. I shouldn't put that in. I hope that is

12:23.273 --> 12:24.574
the number. It's great. Given credit. If you're 
given credit, you see. I couldn't choose. I wanted

12:29.639 --> 12:36.186
to, because Johns Hopkins has a copyright on . Oh, 
no, he wasn't making money. It would also depend on

12:37.852 --> 12:40.955
how old the copyright is, too. I think you've got, 
what, 27 years? Is about all that thing's good for?

12:45.300 --> 12:46.741
No, he had 1932. Because Hopkins would have let him 
know. But Samurai is his own. He published it his

12:54.370 --> 12:57.053
own self. I don't know how. And I don't remember his 
name or anything.

13:08.431 --> 13:14.919
you see, because it's John Patchett, William 
Patchett. He makes that much off of it? No, it sells

13:17.543 --> 13:20.486
for $13 a volume. You get a nice percentage of that. 
That's capital gains. Yes, ma'am, it is. But

13:26.033 --> 13:37.408
capital gains is better than real income because 
you pay only half of what your capital, you pay only

13:26.033 --> 13:37.408
half of what your capital gain is with. I've gone 
through some of that last year for the 72 things we

13:37.777 --> 13:43.264
had.
