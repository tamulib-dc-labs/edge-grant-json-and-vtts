WEBVTT

00:02.495 --> 00:04.397
Okay. We, as former students, could also tie this 
to the gravity of the situation as far as A&M was

00:04.457 --> 00:12.565
concerned, and specifically the cadet corps. In 
any case, a

00:14.547 --> 00:24.457
couple of days after that it had been straightened 
out, and they resumed their functioning. Their

00:24.477 --> 00:28.941
resignation had never been accepted, of course.

00:30.355 --> 00:35.720
But they did not give on the policy. That stuck. In 
other words, hazing was diminished? Hazing was

00:41.226 --> 00:44.029
diminished. And in fact, or just in... Well, I 
think we got into this rather deeply earlier in our

00:44.129 --> 00:55.200
discussions. And again, I go back. You've got to 
allow these cadet commanders to run their

00:57.608 --> 01:01.292
outfits. And you can't have someone there all the 
time supervising them. You'll destroy what

01:05.778 --> 01:15.629
organization you have if you tried to observe them 
all the time, instruct them all the time. I think,

01:17.031 --> 01:21.616
in general, that that policy did stick. I'm sure 
there were exceptions. What they're trying to do

01:25.140 --> 01:27.463
is reduce physical hurt hazing.

01:33.838 --> 01:46.493
But of course, another part of it was to get it into 
focus so that particularly the freshmen weren't

01:33.838 --> 01:46.493
distracted too much of the time from what they're 
there basically to do. But in my opinion, when you

01:48.936 --> 01:55.264
reduce one form, there's going to be something 
else increase a bit. And as long as those cadet

01:55.764 --> 01:58.007
commanders are conscientious in guarding the 
time that their freshmen and sophomores need to do

01:58.882 --> 02:23.742
their studies and guard their rights as we used to 
have it between recall and taps at 11 o'clock.

02:24.802 --> 02:34.015
Most of them are going to say to it that the hazing is 
not going to be too destructive.

02:34.035 --> 02:53.003
It's awfully hard to order a specific change in 
policy for an activity in the cadet corps because

02:34.035 --> 02:53.003
you don't have

02:34.035 --> 02:53.003
the means to go beyond that cadet commander to do 
anything about it. So you've got to have

02:54.265 --> 03:00.090
confidence in him that he understands it and in 
good faith is going to do something about it. And

03:01.191 --> 03:05.235
that's why they made such a point of resistance 
here. Instead of accepting the policy and

03:05.516 --> 03:14.464
ignoring it, they said, we object to this and we 
want you to reconsider. Then

03:14.504 --> 03:22.011
when they came back and said we'll put our officers 
insignia back on and function, they were saying,

03:23.206 --> 03:35.767
in effect, okay, we accept the policy and that 
means that we've got to do something about it. When

03:35.787 --> 03:46.885
you and two others addressed these students, what 
kind of response did they give you? They were in an

03:49.413 --> 03:56.101
emotional state when this incident occurred, 
highly emotional.

03:56.121 --> 03:57.402
They listened politely. I didn't know at the time 
whether we'd been very effective or not.

04:06.373 --> 04:09.897
One of my cohorts became very emotional about it.

04:13.762 --> 04:17.226
They were very serious about it, long faces. And I 
could see question marks on many of those faces. A

04:23.098 --> 04:33.834
very effective cadet leader had really, you might 
say, crystallized their action in a rather sudden

04:23.098 --> 04:33.834
way.

04:36.598 --> 04:46.572
But I think as those days went by and the 
implications were known, and their own personal

04:36.598 --> 04:46.572
situation We're known, and I'm sure they got a lot 
back from Daddy very quickly, particularly the

04:47.108 --> 04:54.214
ex-Aggy Daddies. Sure. As I say, I'm not sure that 
this meeting was critical in the process, but I

04:56.977 --> 05:04.364
think it helped. And you made known the Army's view 
of this insubordination. Well, of course. We made

05:11.810 --> 05:14.753
known the implications to that. from the 
standpoint of the Army. The Army can't tolerate

05:16.764 --> 05:18.446
this sort of thing. They're under contract with 
them. And there are repercussions that this

05:20.349 --> 05:24.955
behavior could have on their careers. And no 
matter what or who attempted to defend those

05:24.975 --> 05:32.865
cadets, they were in a defenseless position.

05:36.470 --> 05:37.551
They can't realize that. And how were relations 
between the staff and the student cadets after

05:40.349 --> 05:47.478
this episode? I don't think this really affected 
too much. Naturally, they looked to the

05:50.362 --> 05:59.614
commandant as the key man involved as far as the 
military staff was concerned. And to his credit,

06:00.596 --> 06:04.821
President Gilchrist made it clearly known this 
was his policy. So it didn't affect too much.

06:11.247 --> 06:15.792
the relationship between the staff and the 
cadets. And I think they all respected Colonel

06:15.812 --> 06:18.616
Malloy very much. I don't think he lost any respect 
over it. I think, you know, we always have one gripe

06:20.478 --> 06:38.098
about somebody in a case like that, and I imagine 
they did more griping about him than any other one

06:20.478 --> 06:38.098
in uniform, but that's because he was the cook in 
the kitchen. How had Texas A&M changed in the six or

06:38.990 --> 06:44.798
seven years that you had been absent? Well, I think 
the major change, of course, had been in the cadet

06:44.818 --> 06:53.431
corps because it was decimated by the war. No fault 
at A&M. That was the major change. And, of course,

06:59.920 --> 07:03.645
the student body wasn't too hefty. I forget how 
many we had in that cadet corps at that time, but it

07:03.665 --> 07:08.592
wasn't very big. It grew rapidly when the war was 
over, and we had probably the most significant

07:09.247 --> 07:23.943
change that I saw was

07:09.247 --> 07:23.943
two, one of which was very pleasing and one of which 
was displeasing.

07:26.366 --> 07:36.037
We had this great input of veterans, many of whom 
had been drafted and served. Many of them had been

07:37.618 --> 07:39.220
drafted out of A&M. Served as enlisted men, came 
back, got in the cadet corps, and were

07:40.128 --> 07:46.576
commissioned when they left. But the remarkable 
thing about them was that A&M or no other

07:46.596 --> 07:57.810
institution, I suppose, had ever seen the 
industry on the part of a body of students that they

07:46.596 --> 07:57.810
showed. And their grade achievement was 
unbelievable. The bell curve just had to be thrown

08:04.579 --> 08:06.962
out the window.

08:09.912 --> 08:16.659
because there were so many of them up there, you 
know, pay students. And so that was a,

08:16.679 --> 08:22.825
of course, that was a very good thing. That 
academic average is way up, and you can imagine the

08:23.225 --> 08:33.455
effect it had on the youngsters who were in the 
classrooms with these. Of course, many of them

08:34.837 --> 08:39.261
came with wives, and the GI Bill was, seeing them 
through, and that's a great thing.

08:47.007 --> 09:09.754
The other thing that was such a drastic change from 
the A&M that I had known, the cadet corps I'd known,

08:47.007 --> 09:09.754
and of course in my day when you thought of A&M you 
thought of the cadet corps because they were the

08:47.007 --> 09:09.754
student body, was that the president made the 
decision in order to really get a hold of this

09:11.540 --> 09:16.926
hazing

09:11.540 --> 09:16.926
to put all the freshmen out at Bryan Field. That was 
my second year there. I believe it was the second

09:22.552 --> 09:32.103
year.

09:32.123 --> 09:34.866
I was assigned as the PMST of Bryan Field. I was 
assigned as the PMS&T of the freshmen. And Luke

09:39.344 --> 09:49.135
Harrison, who was an ex-Aggie and was on the staff 
at A&M, was assigned as the commandant

09:39.344 --> 09:49.135
representative.

09:52.299 --> 09:59.027
Dean Harrington was the, you might say, he was the 
dean of the freshmen at Bryan Field. Later

10:01.430 --> 10:06.336
succeeded by

10:01.430 --> 10:06.336
my great friend,

10:15.766 --> 10:22.936
Dr. Abbott was the successor to Dean Herring when 
he was made president of the university. But this

10:24.998 --> 10:30.326
was an extremely interesting thing, even though I 
disapproved it personally. I lived out there,

10:32.148 --> 10:38.677
lived in the little old apartment in the old 
hospital building at Bryant Field. And these

10:38.697 --> 10:45.486
cadets lived in those old barracks and went to 
school in the mess halls and offices. had their

10:46.782 --> 10:59.643
classrooms there, we did their military 
practical exercises, training, drills,

10:46.782 --> 10:59.643
freshman commanding freshman. We appointed 
acting officers from among the freshmen who'd had

10:59.663 --> 11:10.140
ROTC training in high

10:59.663 --> 11:10.140
school. appointed drill days, we call it. In other 
words, the military science course required them

11:13.890 --> 11:27.710
to be instructed by the military staff

11:13.890 --> 11:27.710
in the practical exercises, usually one 
afternoon a week. Senior cadet officers from the

11:29.092 --> 11:40.549
main campus would come and work with them on that 
drill day.

11:43.178 --> 11:48.584
I guess the most interesting aspect of it was how 
hard those freshmen tried to be good. I mean, to

11:49.785 --> 11:56.232
accomplish what they were asked to do. And they 
became excellent in close order drill because

11:56.752 --> 12:10.587
they actually would go out and drill more extra 
time than they would have if they'd been on the main

11:56.752 --> 12:10.587
campus and the drill times called by their 
commanders.

12:14.701 --> 12:15.882
And they wanted to be good fish. And they were just 
as disappointed to be out there, of course, as the

12:16.023 --> 12:22.450
upperclassmen back at the campus were. 
Displeased that they weren't there. Why was the

12:27.096 --> 12:30.560
order put out that they had to stay out there? It was 
the hazing problem. Oh. So they wanted to separate

12:32.742 --> 12:34.484
the fish. They wanted to just separate. This was 
Dr. Gilchrist's idea. Just completely separate

12:40.311 --> 12:44.556
the freshmen, and that would interrupt this 
hazing bit, see? That was the basic reason for it.

12:51.097 --> 13:01.206
One thing we

12:51.097 --> 13:01.206
did, and let's see, I was there I guess two years 
with those freshmen. And that first year, really

13:01.226 --> 13:07.272
they had time on their hand. They did a lot of this 
extra drilling, but somehow one freshman came to

13:07.292 --> 13:14.779
me. or a group of them came to me, led by a freshman 
from Dallas, who later became the cadet colonel,

13:15.721 --> 13:25.833
by the way, asking if they could form a freshman 
drill team.

13:29.216 --> 13:42.792
And I told them I thought it was a good idea, but I'd 
want to know if they felt they could train

13:29.216 --> 13:42.792
themselves, because it would be very difficult to 
have a non-commissioned officer from the main

13:43.801 --> 13:47.747
campus come out there every day to work with them. 
They said they assured me that they could do it. And

13:50.952 --> 13:58.924
so they wanted us something distinctive for their 
uniform, and we planned all this and got approval

13:50.952 --> 13:58.924
for it and formed that thing. Well, as you know, 
that freshman drill team has won national

14:00.466 --> 14:08.458
competition. Nearly every time it's competed in 
recent years. I know when I was in Washington, I say

14:13.932 --> 14:22.286
recent years, and when I was in Washington, the 
last three or four years I was in Washington, they

14:13.932 --> 14:22.286
came to Washington for the competition and won 
each time. So I, of course, bear pride. Because I

14:26.372 --> 14:28.876
was an observer of the creation of this thing. They 
created it themselves. And thank goodness the

14:31.801 --> 14:37.230
authorities come and approved it. And 
incidentally, I think that was another effort to

14:39.455 --> 14:47.088
show their excellence. And the first time they 
were seen by the cadet corps as a whole was at the

14:47.108 --> 14:58.729
next spring, at the spring football game, you 
know, the inter-squad game. At halftime, we had it

15:00.532 --> 15:02.155
set up for this

15:05.425 --> 15:09.250
And it was kind of funny and it was kind of 
emotional, too. When they took to the field, they

15:11.272 --> 15:23.507
were announced over the loudspeaker system, and 
when they took to the field, there were boos and the

15:11.272 --> 15:23.507
waving of the white handkerchief, and that's an 
insult to an Aggie, you know. That's the sign we

15:23.667 --> 15:26.030
give the tea sippers. But

15:28.373 --> 15:33.880
they were so good. You see, they'd been training 
several months, and the only people who'd ever

15:34.872 --> 15:44.040
seen them had been those cadet officers that came 
out there to work with certain units. But anyway,

15:44.060 --> 15:54.189
they were so good when they finished that that 
whole student body just took to their feet. It was

15:54.910 --> 15:57.292
really something. So they were solid then. They 
were in. And it did a lot to...

16:06.952 --> 16:13.542
You know, if the

16:06.952 --> 16:13.542
main student body's proud of them, it kind of makes 
them apart. Sure, absolutely. So that was sort of a

16:14.604 --> 16:19.752
joining of the fish to the main corps. Now, when the 
veterans came back from the Second World War, they

16:20.093 --> 16:24.960
did not have to join the corps. I'm sure some of them 
Some of them didn't want to join the Corps after

16:27.235 --> 16:32.381
being a veteran of the Second World War. What was 
the relationship between the young student in the

16:32.681 --> 16:38.327
Corps and the veteran? Well, it's true that the 
veterans, they didn't have to wear the uniform.

16:46.255 --> 16:48.918
They didn't have to live in the Corps.

16:52.122 --> 16:55.285
Most of them were very respectful of the Corps. 
And, of course, the Corps was very respectful of

16:56.750 --> 16:58.953
them. I think there were some on the part of all of us 
who were accustomed to looking at that student

16:58.973 --> 17:04.621
body. There were some that didn't like the idea of 
all those civilian clothes on the campus. But I

17:13.494 --> 17:19.242
don't think there was any resentment of those 
veterans at all. I wanted to really respect for

17:20.003 --> 17:21.385
them. And I think it was understood they should 
have that privilege of not being in the It was

17:29.032 --> 17:40.404
interesting, though, how many chose to be and how 
many chose to complete their military training

17:29.032 --> 17:40.404
there for a commission.

17:40.424 --> 17:42.145
A high percentage, do you think? I really don't 
know what the percentage was, but I could just tell

17:42.165 --> 17:49.152
from my own classes, my first and last year there. I 
was at Bryanfield this year. I was on the campus two

17:51.154 --> 17:52.676
years. I was just Bryanfield one year. We'd have a 
good number. good percentage in the in our classes

17:58.073 --> 18:22.950
but what percentage of the veterans it was I don't 
know now you had been a student of course at A&M and

17:58.073 --> 18:22.950
now you came back as an instructor what what'd you 
think of that new role that was very interesting

17:58.073 --> 18:22.950
revealing and somewhat disillusioning can you 
explain yeah I say that I say that uh respectfully

18:24.145 --> 18:27.328
But the reason, perhaps I'd better say the 
disillusioning first. The disillusionment was

18:27.969 --> 18:51.992
that as I went through there as a student and a cadet 
and an appointed cadet leader,

18:27.969 --> 18:51.992
I came to know many of the, of course, well, many of 
the senior officials of the college, the

18:27.969 --> 18:51.992
presidents and the deans and committees and so 
forth.

18:55.904 --> 19:22.772
and I held them in awe and great respect and I still 
do and to me they were just sort of a

18:55.904 --> 19:22.772
a model of

18:55.904 --> 19:22.772
fine men leading a fine purpose in a fine way and all 
of them perfect gentlemen all of them perfect in

18:55.904 --> 19:22.772
their understanding of cadets and everything 
else that goes on there. But when I came back on the

19:28.626 --> 19:52.658
staff and got to competing for funds for this 
activity for the cadet corps,

19:28.626 --> 19:52.658
for classrooms that would meet this requirement 
and so on and so on, I found that they'll fight just

19:28.626 --> 19:52.658
as hard for their territory as those deans will, as 
they will defend the school as a whole. I came to see

19:56.708 --> 19:59.933
a bit of politics at work, and I guess that's 
natural. I never, of course, recognized that

20:00.513 --> 20:06.862
politics were working in the university when I was 
a student. Politics is not bad, but it's a little

20:06.882 --> 20:20.941
disappointing when you feel that maybe old Dean 
so-and-so is not looking beyond his desk when he's

20:06.882 --> 20:20.941
trying to get this done and so forth and so on. So, 
that extended a little bit. as a whole. What way was

20:25.533 --> 20:27.075
it satisfying? Well, the most satisfying thing 
was to be working with the Cadet Corps, not just

20:27.696 --> 20:39.614
training them in what we were there to train them 
in, but to get them back on the road and rebuilt. It

20:39.754 --> 20:43.300
was a matter of rebuilding with new material 
because the material had been taken away. That was

20:45.723 --> 20:47.646
very satisfying. Sounds like it was successful 
also. I think it was. I've of course been It's been

20:54.232 --> 21:08.589
very painful to me to see the cadet corps steadily 
recede to a minuscule part of the student body that

20:54.232 --> 21:08.589
from just at a distance you can hardly observe 
them. I'm sure they're more significant on the

21:10.051 --> 21:22.686
campus than that, but I hope that we can see a 
regrowth in the cadet corps simply because it's

21:10.051 --> 21:22.686
good. It's good for the boys. the men that get in it. 
It's good for the country to have the product of it,

21:25.873 --> 21:30.780
and the state.

21:36.027 --> 21:38.291
But we did, I think, do a pretty good job. We had a 
very fine, two fine commandants while I was there,

21:38.351 --> 21:42.397
and very fine staff. Very well prepared officers 
that were carefully selected to come in there

21:44.400 --> 21:52.211
those early years after World War II. It worked. 
Now what were your feelings when you were

21:55.285 --> 22:05.437
reassigned

21:55.285 --> 22:05.437
and when you were reassigned to go to, you said you 
went to work college. No, you went to Venezuela

22:05.697 --> 22:07.780
right from there. Went to Venezuela, uh huh. It was 
after that, yeah. What were your feelings about

22:10.643 --> 22:12.685
leaving A&M? Well, I was ready to go because you 
know three years is a pretty good normal tour and as

22:12.705 --> 22:25.140
a matter of fact anytime you leave a job you You look 
back and say, well, is there something that I

22:25.508 --> 22:30.315
haven't accomplished that should be 
accomplished? I'm sure at A&M there's always more

22:31.877 --> 22:37.725
to accomplish, but the basic thing we undertook 
had been put well on the road. So I didn't feel that I

22:38.507 --> 22:45.336
need another year to see my part of this finished. 
And I look forward to going to Venezuela, because

22:46.398 --> 22:53.608
when that job, I was first called on the phone to ask 
me if I'd like to have this particular job. to go to

22:55.310 --> 23:09.273
Venezuela with the mission of joining the U.S. 
Army mission there and for my job create an

22:55.310 --> 23:09.273
artillery school in Venezuela. And it was a 
fascinating idea to me. And of course the reason

23:11.877 --> 23:20.912
they called me because my record showed I'd had 
Spanish in school.

23:21.719 --> 23:27.886
asked to be sent to the Army Language School 
because my Spanish had never been good, and my

23:21.719 --> 23:27.886
vocabulary had disappeared. And they said, no, 
it's urgent. If you insist on going to language

23:30.208 --> 23:32.651
school, forget it. So I forgot it. Went on as was, 
and it turned out to be a very interesting

23:34.773 --> 23:43.543
experience.

23:44.464 --> 23:47.507
I'm moving toward Venezuela now, and I was 
wondering, you were the You were the assistant

23:48.044 --> 23:50.606
field artillery advisor. Who was your chief, your 
boss? Colonel John Casey was the senior

23:53.028 --> 23:56.651
artilleryman there. He was also deputy chief of 
mission. Colonel Marsh was the chief of mission.

24:06.620 --> 24:07.661
In other words, the commander. So Colonel Casey 
really functioned primarily as chief of mission.

24:13.686 --> 24:14.927
I mean, deputy chief of mission. And he really 
never was active in the working with the artillery

24:19.853 --> 24:23.016
units of Venezuela. That was basically mine, 
working with the units and getting this artillery

24:23.056 --> 24:31.205
school started. Okay, let's talk about that. We 
were talking a little bit about that last night.

24:34.828 --> 24:49.303
Yeah, well, it was a very interesting challenge, 
of course, because I think as a matter of

24:34.828 --> 24:49.303
background and focus, we ought to point out that 
this was 1949, late 49, that I arrived there. World

24:50.650 --> 24:58.137
War II is just really still in view in the past. Many 
of the Latin American countries had wanted to

24:58.157 --> 25:06.406
contribute to the war in some way, but none of them 
really provided effective fighting forces.

25:07.507 --> 25:15.915
Brazil, as I recall, is the only country in Latin 
America that fielded an expeditionary force, and

25:07.507 --> 25:15.915
they did very little. They arrived late in the 
European theater and didn't do much. I think they

25:19.270 --> 25:20.932
went to Italy, as I recall. I believe that, no one 
told me this, but I believe that having been

25:23.356 --> 25:44.569
through that experience of World War II and seeing 
how ineffective they were, that the Latin

25:23.356 --> 25:44.569
American governments were very conscious of the 
need that they probably should do something to

25:23.356 --> 25:44.569
modernize their military forces in case of need. 
And that they were very receptive to a suggestion,

25:45.595 --> 25:57.991
by the way, from the United States that we put a 
military training mission in, I think, in nearly

25:45.595 --> 25:57.991
every country down there. We proposed that and it 
was accepted. And I think though the main, one of

26:01.215 --> 26:14.792
the reasons that we proposed it was, if I 
understand it correctly, that we didn't want the

26:01.215 --> 26:14.792
history of post World War I repeated.

26:16.983 --> 26:25.153
After World War I, vast numbers of discharged 
German officers went to South America, and they

26:16.983 --> 26:25.153
became an influence in those armed forces down 
there. And for you to see that, all you have to do is

26:26.134 --> 26:29.138
look at their uniforms today. And if you can see a 
movie of a parade in most any Latin American

26:31.100 --> 26:44.897
country, even today, that influence is still 
visible, and most emphatically, by the way they do

26:45.181 --> 26:48.284
the goose step when they pass the reviewing stand. 
That came from Germany. So anyway, there were also

26:51.167 --> 26:55.171
Italian officers and so forth in there. And there 
was sort of a mix. Most of them there is private,

26:57.814 --> 27:02.458
retired, or discharged individual. But 
nevertheless, the influence was there. And so we

27:04.400 --> 27:13.990
replaced that influence and set out to

27:04.400 --> 27:13.990
advise and assist in modernizing armed forces of 
those Latin American countries. At the same time,

27:19.665 --> 27:39.928
when we back off and look at it, and even when I was 
there I could see it, at the same time our

27:19.665 --> 27:39.928
government and the State Department was making 
judgments on really how modern or how much should

27:19.665 --> 27:39.928
these countries have, how much modernity and how 
much equipment and what kinds. They resented

27:40.609 --> 27:41.850
that. It was hard to see, I guess, that there was any 
external threat to Latin America. They were not

27:51.087 --> 27:53.750
prone to ally among themselves. In fact, more 
prone to fight among themselves, although

27:53.870 --> 28:01.719
there's been no serious fight for decades among 
them. But I could see, as an observer in Venezuela,

28:03.020 --> 28:13.812
that the Venezuelans' officers felt that someday 
they were probably going to have to fight

28:03.020 --> 28:13.812
Colombia. or someday they're probably going to 
have to fight Guayana.

28:20.063 --> 28:31.995
I guess when they look around their borders, 
Brazil was, there's so much jungle between them

28:20.063 --> 28:31.995
and the nearest road to Brazil that that wasn't a 
worry, but their other neighbors were. So anyway,

28:34.317 --> 28:38.221
our efforts- What about the threat of communism? I 
beg your pardon? What about the threat of

28:39.122 --> 28:40.403
communism? At the time I was there, it was not 
significant at all. Not as significant at all.

28:47.107 --> 28:50.932
This occurred subsequently, that threat. But I 
think in the form of general comments, again, it

28:52.094 --> 29:14.022
was a little bit frustrating to be there to 
convince the Venezuelans that we could help them

28:52.094 --> 29:14.022
modernize and make them effective armed forces 
and then have their request for Venezuela could

29:14.272 --> 29:15.853
buy. They had the money. That oil and iron and 
everything. To be refused by the State Department

29:20.317 --> 29:38.593
an order of cannon or fighter aircraft or 
whatever, Navy ships, it just didn't seem to make

29:20.317 --> 29:38.593
much sense to the Venezuelans. They resented 
that. They resented it. It seemed clear to me that

29:44.444 --> 30:00.934
the leadership in Venezuela was also conscious of 
the fact that, aside from this stepbrother

29:44.444 --> 30:00.934
position they were in vis-a-vis the United 
States, that we didn't seem very important to

29:44.444 --> 30:00.934
them. They didn't seem very important to us. They 
got that impression.

30:11.056 --> 30:39.004
important matters of national security or 
international security and international

30:11.056 --> 30:39.004
affairs and economic affairs were elsewhere we 
took for granted the economic relationships and

30:11.056 --> 30:39.004
we also took for granted the dominance of the 
political relationship our dominant position

30:11.056 --> 30:39.004
that's the way they viewed it but where we had money 
to go in to help people it was primarily in europe

30:11.056 --> 30:39.004
and where we had strategic considerations to 
really come to grips with outside of Latin

30:39.203 --> 30:43.809
America. It was in Europe and in the East. So those 
people aren't unlearned

30:49.296 --> 31:03.895
down there, and they're pretty intelligent 
people, and I think they found it very difficult to

30:49.296 --> 31:03.895
remain good allies. as opposed now, and not 
opposed, but it's easier for them to be good trade

31:04.853 --> 31:12.181
partners because it's just natural that we trade 
together.

31:14.923 --> 31:20.669
So anyway, that was the atmosphere in which I 
worked. But my job was a very fixed and simple one.

31:24.713 --> 31:29.258
And the complexities were small, but many. The job 
was to get an artillery school established and

31:30.318 --> 31:36.848
they never had one. I was surprised to learn after I 
got down there that they didn't have a basis to

31:36.868 --> 31:44.920
spring from, a base to spring from. They didn't 
really have a trained artillery branch. They had

31:48.065 --> 31:49.888
nothing that resembled a school. They had nothing 
that resembled a universal artillery training

31:55.630 --> 32:00.275
program for advancing officers in their 
capabilities.

32:03.960 --> 32:07.844
And therefore, this school concept started with 
me. Well, that makes you feel pretty

32:07.984 --> 32:13.711
self-conscious, you know, and feel the 
responsibility of it. So, I'd been there, got

32:13.971 --> 32:24.523
there in September of 49, and in November, the G3 of 
the Armed forces called me in. He's the one that, of

32:26.504 --> 32:37.294
course, had planned this, and asked me if I would 
start a little informal class there at the

32:26.504 --> 32:37.294
Ministry of Defense with some artillery officers 
just to get started. The Venezuelan G3?

32:39.355 --> 32:40.316
Venezuelan G3. And the idea, I guess, as much as 
anything else, would get me prepared, which made

32:42.098 --> 32:48.543
sense. But I told him, well, you know, my Spanish 
isn't very good. He's very good in English. I've

32:54.322 --> 32:56.004
got some Spanish to learn. And also, since I've 
gotten here and seen what has to be done, I have

32:56.045 --> 33:08.142
written to Port Sale, Oklahoma for lesson 
material so that we can start a course. We can

33:09.525 --> 33:12.429
design one for our needs here and get it going. But I 
said, the main problem right now is the language.

33:15.774 --> 33:21.342
But if you'll give me a translator and allow that 
you know, extra time it takes, sure, I'll get

33:21.608 --> 33:25.493
something going. He said, oh, no, our policy is 
there'll be no translators in any of the classes. I

33:33.563 --> 33:37.649
said, well, then it seems to me that you're going to 
have to give me a little more time to get prepared.

33:38.330 --> 33:40.252
He said, oh, I think you can do it. You know, I said, 
you can do it. And we need to get going. So I didn't

33:47.942 --> 33:49.123
argue the matter. I took it to my chief, the 
missions. At that time, it wasn't Colonel Marsh.

33:54.057 --> 34:00.887
At that time, it was Colonel Marsh's predecessor, 
who was very fluent in Spanish, beautifully,

33:54.057 --> 34:00.887
spoke it beautifully. And I presented the 
problem, and I fully expected that he'd support

34:01.688 --> 34:06.635
me, and we'd get this thing into reason. He said, 
well, I think you can do it. So there I was. Anyway,

34:10.380 --> 34:18.211
all I tell this for you is that it really forced me to 
get that Spanish or go home. It's that simple.

34:21.515 --> 34:27.423
Well, as you know, Spanish is probably the easiest 
language in the world to learn and use. But

34:28.264 --> 34:30.387
anybody's got to have a vocabulary. Sure. It's 
easy to drive nails, but you've got to have nails.

34:35.995 --> 34:36.676
So what did you do? So what we did was start this 
little course, and I went over every other day for

34:36.916 --> 34:43.485
two hours. This gave me a lot of time to struggle 
with it. I would do my lesson plans, have the

34:48.599 --> 34:56.992
mission translator translated into Spanish. I 
would study it. I would rewrite it in the Spanish

34:59.636 --> 35:02.220
that I felt I could use. And I'd try my best to 
memorize

35:03.702 --> 35:09.010
it. And I'd make a little series of rites or 
exercises to be done with paper

35:21.016 --> 35:24.860
I had to have some other means than my Spanish. 
Well, this went on from late November until March

35:25.862 --> 35:33.831
of the next year. 1950. By March, I didn't have to 
use the translator. I didn't have to memorize the

35:41.540 --> 35:44.623
Spanish. I had learned, relearned my basic 
grammar and Of course, I never lost the

35:49.552 --> 35:51.314
pronunciation.

35:53.778 --> 35:59.225
And I had acquired a pretty decent military 
vocabulary, which was new to me in any case. Then in

36:00.567 --> 36:05.473
March, we started, that was just sort of a 
makeshift course. The same officers then joined.

36:09.839 --> 36:10.520
How many were there? There were about eight 
officers, a small group. It turned out it was a very

36:13.664 --> 36:15.367
wise thing to do. I wouldn't have gotten prepared 
any other way under those policies. So in March we

36:19.387 --> 36:31.199
started the first full-time,

36:19.387 --> 36:31.199
not full-time, the first everyday series course. 
For two hours every day? This was two hours every

36:34.343 --> 36:35.744
day. Plus, on certain days we'd have exercises 
that would take a whole half a day. They had a little

36:42.792 --> 36:48.938
place called El Valle, the valley, in which there 
was a small military installation. And it was a

36:49.525 --> 36:51.467
little military reservation. And we could shoot 
the 105 howitzers in there. We had very short

36:55.050 --> 36:57.633
minimum ranges. We could hardly shoot over 2,000 
yards in a very narrow corridor, and therefore, a

36:58.594 --> 37:09.785
very small selection of targets to practice them 
on. But we could get the mechanics in, and we could

37:09.805 --> 37:12.288
get the guns. So you could give them some 
on-the-job training. So we could give them some

37:14.049 --> 37:18.874
practical training.

37:20.862 --> 37:28.909
few officers in this class, including most of 
those who were in that first class. And about

37:28.929 --> 37:44.864
halfway through this course, which ran until that 
fall,

37:28.929 --> 37:44.864
two young officers, lieutenants, returned from 
the United States Artillery School. And they

37:44.884 --> 37:47.026
assisted me, not full time. They had other jobs, 
but they'd assist me. classes but I was the

37:49.853 --> 38:19.371
instructor then when that training was finished 
we went to the field that year first time I guess

37:49.853 --> 38:19.371
they've done a field exercise in true sense in 
their careers and well that's a long story of how we

37:49.853 --> 38:19.371
found it but we found a beautiful piece of terrain 
out in the hinterland about 150 kilometers from

37:49.853 --> 38:19.371
Caracas

37:49.853 --> 38:19.371
it would have been a credit to any service school. 
It was just terrain that individuals in the

38:21.981 --> 38:27.229
government owned some of it, but just wasn't 
occupied. Minimal roads into it, as you might

38:29.413 --> 38:31.556
imagine. And we spent, all told, three weeks out 
there applying what these young, what these

38:33.800 --> 38:43.435
people had been trained to do in artillery. And our 
old saying in the artillery is, what you've got to

38:44.461 --> 38:50.108
learn is how to shoot, move, and communicate. But 
in order to do those things effectively, you've

38:51.109 --> 38:56.615
got to be out in the field to do it. On maneuvers. 
That's right. Well, it was highly successful from

38:59.879 --> 39:04.404
their point of view for several reasons. One, it 
went very well. They found that they could do the

39:07.688 --> 39:10.992
things that they'd been trained to do. in the 
classroom and in that little practical exercise

39:11.275 --> 39:15.520
area to do.

39:18.343 --> 39:23.850
They were the only school class in the Venezuelan 
Army that got to go to their field exercise. They'd

39:23.910 --> 39:38.768
been planned for the other branches too, but the 
dictator President Delgado Chabot had been

39:23.910 --> 39:38.768
assassinated just in a few months, a few weeks, I 
guess, before we were supposed to go. And again,

39:39.322 --> 39:45.091
this G3 felt that we should go because we were ahead 
of the others. But all the others were canceled

39:45.191 --> 39:49.457
because of that incident. And so that kind of made 
these artillerymen feel they were ahead, too.

39:54.906 --> 40:02.017
Furthermore, the succeeding dictator, Paris 
Jimenez, came out for the final exercise, and he

39:54.906 --> 40:02.017
was so impressed. Because it's not that it was... 
So absolutely excellent, but it was so far beyond

40:07.385 --> 40:12.733
what they'd ever known before. He was so 
impressed, and we did a full blue shoot and

40:15.196 --> 40:26.452
communicate exercise for him with a very 
impressive artillery fire for him to observe. He

40:28.795 --> 40:33.662
ordered that next year there would be a combined 
field exercise mission. infantry supported by

40:34.823 --> 41:03.970
artillery and engineers and signal and with armor 
they had an armored battalion or two and so

40:34.823 --> 41:03.970
actually the next year we did that but as far as the 
course and the artillery school was concerned

40:34.823 --> 41:03.970
after that first year of training and winding up 
with that initial field exercise then the

40:34.823 --> 41:03.970
artillery school of Venezuela was formally 
chartered And we took

41:05.789 --> 41:18.329
Major

41:05.789 --> 41:18.329
Jose Quevedo to be the commandant. He was promoted 
to lieutenant colonel. He was one of the three

41:19.751 --> 41:22.976
majors in that first course. I was his advisor. The 
two young officers who'd been trained at Fort Sill

41:27.743 --> 41:32.691
were put on the teaching staff, along with Were 
those Venezuelans? They were Venezuelans.

41:38.014 --> 41:44.564
Along with the Venezuelan officers from that 
first course who were outstanding.

41:44.584 --> 41:47.489
And then we had the first full-time course. Run by 
the Venezuelans. Run by the Venezuelans. And this

41:53.238 --> 41:57.565
full-time course, as was the one that I taught you, 
And as all the courses in the Venezuelan Army

41:59.485 --> 42:08.673
became officers' courses like that in the other 
branches, those were qualifying courses for

41:59.485 --> 42:08.673
promotion. Anyone who didn't go through that 
course or pass that course didn't get promoted. So

42:15.439 --> 42:18.201
you could see the motivation that attended. That 
was a very great aid to me, of course, in the very

42:19.282 --> 42:23.346
beginning.

42:26.108 --> 42:28.210
It also was a problem because there

42:33.623 --> 42:42.313
You would expect standards to be somewhat 
different in various ways against two

42:33.623 --> 42:42.313
civilizations, comparing two civilizations, 
theirs and ours. But initially, I set the basic

42:44.055 --> 42:51.944
standards for that initial course. And then when 
we formed this school, we had to set some of the

42:51.964 --> 42:56.690
norms. And one of them had to do with ensuring that 
each officer did his own work.

43:06.698 --> 43:14.372
because he would scramble to be sure he passed and 
got qualified for promotion and everything.

43:15.373 --> 43:26.934
Well, those standards that we established in that 
first course that I taught were basically applied

43:15.373 --> 43:26.934
to the new thing, and they really had a new set of 
standards, too, for conductive classes. And what

43:27.234 --> 43:28.136
were those standards? And that spread.

43:37.630 --> 43:55.709
It required, of course, that an officer be 
absolutely above reproach on doing his own work,

43:37.630 --> 43:55.709
whether it was work to be accomplished outside of 
the classroom by him, or in the classroom, or on a

43:37.630 --> 43:55.709
test. They just never observed such a standard 
seriously before. And I guess the big difference

44:00.293 --> 44:03.316
was this qualifier for promotion. In other words, 
you've seen professors that say, I don't care how

44:07.060 --> 44:11.644
you get it, just so you get that information in your 
head. But when you're grading this fellow against

44:13.206 --> 44:18.331
that one for purposes of promotion, it's got to be 
different than that. It's got to be very strict.

44:19.752 --> 44:23.015
They had not had that strict standard. Another 
standard we had was that a very important means of

44:24.757 --> 44:32.344
instruction is the demonstration.

44:35.187 --> 44:36.628
In their military academy or

44:47.037 --> 45:01.931
And the standard was that a poor demonstration is 
worse than no demonstration, and so you'll

44:47.037 --> 45:01.931
rehearse the demonstration out on the side of the 
students as many times as necessary to make it as

44:47.037 --> 45:01.931
near perfect as you can expect it to be. That's 
something they'd never really heard of. Another

45:06.256 --> 45:14.884
standard was that no class would be conducted 
without appropriate aids to instruction,

45:16.214 --> 45:20.801
basically graphical aids. The various means of 
instruction, the least effective is the lecture

45:21.001 --> 45:31.697
because of the inability of our mind to record 
words.

45:36.224 --> 45:40.049
If you see something done, you're going to 
remember more than if you just heard about it. And

45:41.411 --> 45:46.018
of course, if you do it, you're going to remember 
much more than the other two combined. So anyway,

45:49.898 --> 45:54.743
those were the kind of standards we tried to get in 
there, and it worked. And it spread to the other

45:54.763 --> 46:12.239
schools, because at this point, because of that 
misfortune of everybody being grounded in their

45:54.763 --> 46:12.239
fortresses, so to speak, when the president was 
assassinated, except the artillery corps, we got

45:54.763 --> 46:12.239
a head up in the scene. How'd you get along with the 
Venezuelan soldiers? How'd the American army and

46:14.741 --> 46:17.203
the Venezuelans get along? We got along fine. And I 
think our training mission, I forget how many

46:19.192 --> 46:24.058
officers we had. We had, it seems to me, about 20 
officers, 20-odd officers in that mission, and a

46:24.138 --> 46:32.629
corresponding number of non-commissioned 
officers. And we were spread out advising the

46:32.650 --> 46:38.958
various branches and the various headquarters. 
We got along well. I will say this, though,

46:42.142 --> 46:45.807
speaking of differences.

46:48.638 --> 46:57.512
In the Venezuelan Army, the personality

46:48.638 --> 46:57.512
of the person makes a lot more difference than it 
does in our Army. I mean, you know, we're

46:58.494 --> 47:11.916
accustomed in our Army to accepting a leader or a 
cohort

46:58.494 --> 47:11.916
based on the way he operates and what he gets 
accomplished. But the personality is more

47:11.936 --> 47:14.680
important there.
