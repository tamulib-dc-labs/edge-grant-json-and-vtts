00:01.702 --> 00:06.128
Please return this copy to Army Services 
Technical Information Center, Dayton, Ohio.

00:09.112 --> 00:14.840
So presumably this is where a lot of the Air Force 
documents. They were in Dayton, Ohio, the

00:14.860 --> 00:17.283
not-building Dayton, Ohio. Were accumulated at 
one time or another, but then this goes back where

00:18.145 --> 00:22.391
they are now. It's hard to say. Okay. Now, the next 
few questions I wanted to ask you to close off the

00:24.974 --> 00:30.021
technical oil mission part. I have to do with 
questions other people should like for an answer

00:30.457 --> 00:35.925
on, if it's possible. If you were going to begin to 
catalog the documents, that is to abstract them

00:37.348 --> 00:48.685
and to index them and place them on a computer, 
would you begin with the technical oil mission

00:37.348 --> 00:48.685
documents first?

00:55.583 --> 01:02.214
Well, are you considering all the technology in 
synthetic fuels or just the technical emissions?

01:02.334 --> 01:08.985
All synthetic fuels,

01:02.334 --> 01:08.985
I think. There are literally tons of documents. I 
know. And ERDA itself has published, I suspect,

01:12.911 --> 01:18.260
wagon loads of material. And how to ever get that 
indexed into a...

01:25.503 --> 01:30.911
into something and somebody could quickly find 
what he wanted. I have no idea how you do that. Well,

01:32.854 --> 01:40.084
I think they're considering only documents 
coming out of Germany, not things done since

01:32.854 --> 01:40.084
Germany. That would... Of

01:41.667 --> 01:51.561
course, there's a lot of a lot of published 
literature out of Germany. Actually, since the

01:57.026 --> 02:13.041
war, the Germans have done almost nothing on 
collagenation or the fission process or

01:57.026 --> 02:13.041
synthetic fuels generally, because they have 
been using oil

01:57.026 --> 02:13.041
that they imported mostly.

02:20.267 --> 02:23.590
So in effect, it seems to me that If you could 
confine your indexing to the technical oil

02:24.042 --> 02:41.275
mission documents, well, this might be a possible 
approach to it, but to consider a broader area

02:24.042 --> 02:41.275
would mean an awful lot of literature had to be 
considered. from IRDA and from the Bureau of Mines

02:43.769 --> 02:49.957
and from the Office of Coal Research and from the 
universities and everybody else. Because

02:49.977 --> 02:58.849
there's been work going on all over the United 
States in particular and in a number of other

02:49.977 --> 02:58.849
countries as well. OK. Well, from the documents 
brought back to Germany, then. From Germany. From

03:04.717 --> 03:05.738
Germany. The war documents, really, for lack of a 
better word, the documents that we selected in

03:11.444 --> 03:20.075
Germany and shipped back to this country and to 
England, if those were going to be indexed and

03:11.444 --> 03:20.075
cataloged, should they begin the technical oil 
mission? Or should they begin exploring other

03:20.576 --> 03:23.640
archives?

03:31.711 --> 03:36.557
Of course, there was a lot of work in Germany. done, 
well, practically all the work was done for the

03:37.482 --> 03:41.228
technical oil mission. So I would, I guess you 
really ought to consider all the work that was done

03:41.608 --> 04:01.077
in the 1920 to 1940 period, which was published in 
Germany, and then add to that all the work that was

03:41.608 --> 04:01.077
brought back for the technical oil mission.

04:09.899 --> 04:22.110
And let me

04:09.899 --> 04:22.110
think just

04:09.899 --> 04:22.110
a minute. It's really a field that I don't consider 
myself very well qualified in this business index

04:22.131 --> 04:30.779
and documents. But

04:30.799 --> 04:39.687
the Bureau of Mining, you know, has published 
Indices of patents and...

05:05.806 --> 05:07.889
Yeah, this is the... You got that? Yeah, this is the 
index of the microfilm reels of technical oil

05:08.489 --> 05:21.325
emissions.

05:21.485 --> 05:28.354
It's not synthetic fuel, but it's part of the 
synthetic fuel.

05:38.206 --> 05:49.358
Well, I think what's being considered is to go 
through the German documents and abstract the

05:38.206 --> 05:49.358
information and place it on a computer. Should 
they begin with technical oil emission

05:49.378 --> 05:53.430
documents, or should they begin with other 
documents?

06:17.592 --> 06:28.577
Now, there's an index like that, I think it's a 
little bit bigger, on collagenation patents,

06:17.592 --> 06:28.577
too. I'm sure I got it someplace here in the book, in 
case I can't...

06:46.432 --> 06:48.936
I think there's some 3,000 patents in there. Just 
on? Cohonogenation. Cohonogenation. Up to 1950,

06:53.704 --> 06:55.827
I believe. I don't know when that thing was 
published.

07:03.019 --> 07:03.780
In three parts. 1951. I don't believe I've got the 
other two parts. I'm very sorry.

07:11.954 --> 07:12.675
But...

07:15.608 --> 07:18.473
I have read this book. It's a series of abstracts. 
It's just a little piece here. I think I've read

07:24.081 --> 07:27.327
every patent in there. And you see here I've made 
whole notes on the whole thing, trying to anchor

07:27.347 --> 07:38.865
into my mind what the previous technology was.

07:43.908 --> 07:51.985
I don't remember exactly how this is divided up, 
but I'm sure there's some classification in here,

07:43.908 --> 07:51.985
patents. I guess it's just, maybe it's 
chronologically, I don't know, or patent number

07:52.005 --> 08:01.765
or something

07:52.005 --> 08:01.765
like that. I don't know how to do that, John, that 
you're talking about.

08:11.701 --> 08:18.109
We've, the Bureau of Mine says, as you see it, made 
attempts at certain sections of it.

08:21.494 --> 08:34.350
But I don't think,

08:21.494 --> 08:34.350
I don't know as if,

08:21.494 --> 08:34.350
I don't know whether you can improve on what's 
already been done or whether you can't.

08:39.376 --> 08:53.392
I'm sure you can put all that in a computer so maybe 
you can index it in some way so you can call up what

08:39.376 --> 08:53.392
you want with less trouble and this, but I really

08:39.376 --> 08:53.392
don't know how to do that. Yeah, I think they're 
talking about making a box by box and item by item

08:53.412 --> 09:07.088
search of all the German documents brought over

08:53.412 --> 09:07.088
and abstracting those.

09:11.658 --> 09:13.100
Well, good luck to you.

09:17.024 --> 09:20.889
Well, assuming that's what they're going to do, 
should they begin with the TOM documents? Should

09:21.089 --> 09:23.052
they begin out random? I'm talking really just in 
terms of personal opinion. I really realize that

09:25.775 --> 09:29.699
you don't have any. Well, the TOM documents only 
cover a small segment of the coal, hydrogenation,

09:29.719 --> 09:37.729
and fission droppers technology. That's the 
trouble. It does, huh? Yeah.

09:43.788 --> 09:45.650
And the others are found outside of Germany? Some 
of them may be found in Germany and many of them

09:45.670 --> 09:50.076
outside of Germany. I see. They're all over the 
world, the United States, England, everywhere.

09:58.146 --> 09:59.067
You bet. Okay. Now, have some of the documents been 
in effect lost or destroyed since they've been

10:01.330 --> 10:09.340
stored here, as far as you know? In other words, are 
there sizable blocks or documents missing

10:11.902 --> 10:15.968
anyplace? Well, to my knowledge,

10:15.988 --> 10:24.038
I don't really know, but I don't know where they 
were stored in the first place. I only have the

10:24.479 --> 10:26.982
vaguest idea of where they were stored. And this is 
a hearsay story that you can maybe check out on, but

10:28.785 --> 10:41.402
we did... a lot of work in Louisiana, Missouri, as 
you know, and recorded it in the annual reports.

10:48.035 --> 10:50.978
But the annual reports are not very detailed 
reports. And a lot of the detailed data that we got

10:52.240 --> 10:59.809
from Louisiana, Missouri, was supposedly stored 
at Pittsburgh. Well, later on, it was moved from

11:00.710 --> 11:05.196
Pittsburgh to Morgantown, West Virginia. And 
then IRDA authorized a restudy of that Louisiana,

11:06.070 --> 11:12.156
Missouri data. And they authorized Floor to 
restudy that data plus some other data from the

11:13.318 --> 11:21.847
Office of Coal Research and various other places. 
And the Floor people told me that they went down to

11:22.948 --> 11:32.618
Morgantown and the documents from Louisiana, 
Missouri had all been destroyed shortly before

11:22.948 --> 11:32.618
they got there as it happened. So that's the only 
thing I know of officially that's been lost and

11:34.724 --> 11:39.212
destroyed. But I don't know what happened to all 
the files that the Department of Commerce had

11:39.272 --> 11:49.330
either, except I guess you said they were 
microfilmed. Yeah, they're supposed to have been

11:49.350 --> 11:50.792
microfilmed. According to these charts I went 
through, they're supposed to have been

11:50.812 --> 11:54.278
microfilmed and sent out. And allegedly, Private 
Enterprise could check this index and call for

11:57.657 --> 11:59.399
something they wanted. I presume that's what the 
index was for. Well, it seems to me I have some vague

12:01.642 --> 12:12.156
recollection that they did try to preserve this on 
microfilm so people could get it if they wanted it

12:01.642 --> 12:12.156
at some future date. But whether it was actually 
done or not, I don't know. And presumably that you

12:16.141 --> 12:19.566
could read through the indexes. And if something 
interested you, they're supposed to be able to

12:19.586 --> 12:25.133
call those out for you to go through some kind of 
report.

12:27.273 --> 12:27.974
I don't know. Technical oil mission, though, now, 
it's really much more concerned with other things

12:27.994 --> 12:33.945
than petroleum, is it not? Well, the technical oil 
mission, if you consider TOM directly, we were

12:34.986 --> 12:46.026
really confined all our efforts to synthetic 
fuel. I got a damn Greek I'm supposed to talk to

12:46.046 --> 12:49.652
about a report, I think. Well, you know, frankly, 
the problem I have is I don't know what documents

12:51.320 --> 13:02.015
have been looked at and what documents haven't 
been looked at and where they're stored and what

12:51.320 --> 13:02.015
they are and whether they're duplicate or not 
duplicate documents. And so your problem is

13:04.218 --> 13:10.307
unless you know them.

13:17.257 --> 13:31.337
After you leave the bureau... You know, I sort of 
wonder...

13:17.257 --> 13:31.337
Did you talk to Ernie to see if they've made any 
surveys of the previous legislature? No. Well,

13:35.002 --> 13:39.389
they've hired an awful lot of people to do an awful 
lot of studying. And I wonder if they might not be a

13:41.452 --> 13:45.998
good place to start.

13:52.728 --> 13:59.996
We did a lot of work at the Bureau of Mines on 
surveying the earth literature, as you see here.

14:01.478 --> 14:16.334
But that work was pretty well wound up in the early 
50s, and it ought to be carried forward beyond the

14:01.478 --> 14:16.334
time the Bureau of Mines has carried it forward. 
Now, it's possible the Office of Coal Research has

14:16.354 --> 14:21.199
done some. You know, I think another group you 
ought to talk to is Ephraim.

14:28.632 --> 14:32.759
I don't know how much studying, I don't know how 
much reviewing they've done of literature out

14:28.632 --> 14:32.759
there. But I think Erda's really a better group to 
start with.

14:43.215 --> 14:47.001
You leave the Bureau of Mines in 1952. I inferred 
from your interview you left it because you felt

14:47.369 --> 14:54.577
like they would do nothing else with synthetic 
fuels. Is that correct?

14:58.521 --> 15:15.739
Yeah, I wouldn't say that they would do nothing 
with synthetic fuels, but I felt that the interest

14:58.521 --> 15:15.739
in synthetic fuels had gone downhill at a very 
large rate because of oil in the Middle East.

15:16.192 --> 15:18.894
uh... tend to lose track of synthetic fuels? I 
don't... that's not... that's not... Well...

15:18.934 --> 15:25.660
From 53 to 62, you don't seem to be very active in 
synthetic fuels. Is that fair? Except at that work

15:26.021 --> 15:30.365
I did at Spencer Chemical Company in El Paso, a 
natural gas company. Okay. And then from 60, uh...

15:34.208 --> 15:36.330
I took out those patents in the early 60s. And from 
60 to 68, I did very little in synthetic fuels

15:38.011 --> 15:45.658
because I was working then on, uh... Actually, I 
was very much more busy with my consulting work,

15:47.191 --> 15:53.839
and I was working on building ammonia plants and 
things of that nature. So there was a period of

15:53.879 --> 16:01.067
about seven years in there, which I did relatively 
little in synthetic oil. And then when the Arab,

16:01.087 --> 16:12.241
well, before the Arab scare came up, the Academy of 
Engineers started to review, again,

16:01.087 --> 16:12.241
gasification processes and so forth. And I 
started to work with them, and that aroused my

16:12.261 --> 16:15.865
interest again. And that's how you come back to it. 
Yeah. That started about 1967, 68.

16:24.054 --> 16:35.432
And I'll tell you another thing that brought me 
back to it was the Union Pacific asked me to take a

16:24.054 --> 16:35.432
look at the possibility of coal mining on the Union 
Pacific Railroad. And this was about the time we

16:36.614 --> 16:44.586
got into our environmental problems with the 
power plants and so on and so forth. And that work

16:45.106 --> 16:52.954
for the Union Pacific brought me back into 
synthetic fuels. And I take it that presently at

16:52.974 --> 17:01.163
least you're not optimistic about synthetic 
fuels solving the nation's oil crises.

17:07.190 --> 17:09.552
I wouldn't say that I'm optimistic. I said you're 
not optimistic. I'm not optimistic. I believe

17:12.135 --> 17:14.758
that if we can get a substantial improvement in 
existing processes by hydrogenating coal

17:15.734 --> 17:31.087
directly with hydrogen gas that we got a chance of 
helping ourselves greatly on our oil supply

17:15.734 --> 17:31.087
century. Does that sum it up for you? Mm-hmm. Sure 
does.
