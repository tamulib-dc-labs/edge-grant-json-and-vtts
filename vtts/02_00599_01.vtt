00:01.853 --> 00:07.061
Thomas F. Urban of Senator Ralph W. Yarborough on 
April 22, 1985. In 1964,

00:07.081 --> 00:21.062
President Lyndon Johnson stated, quote, I don't 
think Texas has had a senator that voted for the

00:07.081 --> 00:21.062
people more than Senator Yarborough has voted for 
them. And no member of the U.S. Senate has stood up

00:21.082 --> 00:30.156
and fought for me or fought for the people more 
since I became president than Ralph Yarborough.

00:30.997 --> 00:40.490
What was your relationship with President 
Johnson, and how did it change over the years as he

00:30.997 --> 00:40.490
was first senior senator from Texas and later vice 
president and president? Well, when I first went

00:42.013 --> 00:46.439
to the Senate, of course, Johnson had opposed my 
election. He had opposed it from the governor and

00:46.479 --> 00:48.882
then all the way through. His was the big money of 
Texas, and I represented the people. Now, Johnson

00:52.087 --> 00:56.473
was a very, very clever politician. He would vote 
for the people on a number of issues, but enough to

01:00.646 --> 01:10.057
say he was progressive, but not to alienate that 
vast big money that was supporting him. And some

01:10.077 --> 01:19.567
average senator, like the two we've got now, one Bo 
Weaver and one Republican, they just voted

01:10.077 --> 01:19.567
against the people the majority of the time, the 
whole time. Johnson didn't. If it was a matter

01:21.149 --> 01:26.215
affecting union labor, he generally voted with 
the big contracts. If it was a matter that affected

01:27.055 --> 01:33.745
the poor, he would vote with Sam Rayburn for Social 
Security and things like that. So, he didn't want

01:34.086 --> 01:40.355
to see anybody else coming along with the record 
that I had of voting for people all the time.

01:41.417 --> 01:49.930
Because he told friends he wanted to be president, 
and all of Newark around Washington told him that

01:41.417 --> 01:49.930
he voted the way he voted against the blacks. He 
could never be president. He told them that... He

01:53.498 --> 01:54.739
had to get elected. He couldn't be president if he 
wasn't elected first, and then the Senate. He had

01:58.002 --> 01:59.623
to vote that way in Texas. They'd have to 
understand if you didn't vote that way, you

01:59.663 --> 02:03.587
couldn't be elected. Well, when I voted on, when I 
was elected with no money, you might say, on the

02:03.667 --> 02:17.439
platform of fairness and equal treatment to 
everybody, Johnson immediately switched and

02:03.667 --> 02:17.439
began to support civil rights bills, and all of 
them had been introduced. That was a big switch in

02:18.540 --> 02:20.842
his... He didn't switch his... his position. He 
had opposed me in those races, so when he ran for the

02:25.404 --> 02:32.335
Presidency in 1960, I supported John F. Kennedy. 
Johnston was very mad about that. I wasn't

02:34.298 --> 02:35.861
particularly sore with him. I felt better about my 
relationship with him. I repaid him. I showed him

02:39.126 --> 02:40.488
he couldn't bluff me. I wasn't afraid of him, so I 
just wanted to let him know I was his that I was his

02:44.630 --> 02:48.135
equal in independence of thought. Couldn't push 
me around. He thought that being vice president,

02:49.918 --> 02:55.166
later president, people from Texas ought to take 
orders from him. Thought I would take orders from

02:55.186 --> 02:56.568
him. I supported my own bills, whether he was for or 
against them. But our relationship was not a

02:59.892 --> 03:05.761
bitter relationship that's been painted up in the 
press a lot. He appointed my son member of the

03:05.781 --> 03:13.152
Indian Claims Commission, where he served 11 
years, and I very much appreciate that. I have at

03:13.840 --> 03:21.019
least 30 autographed photographs of Lyndon 
Johnson and me over the years. I was down at the

03:21.580 --> 03:23.565
White House a lot. He told me one time, he said, 
Ralph, you never give me any property. Come down

03:26.793 --> 03:27.816
here and talk. And you don't go down back and make a 
statement about it. I never did make a statement

03:31.214 --> 03:34.177
about it, as it does the White House. I knew he had 
the power the next day to say, well, that isn't so.

03:37.882 --> 03:39.003
That's not what I said. And I wasn't going to give 
him that chance. But what he had me down there for

03:42.166 --> 03:46.711
was a judiciary appointment of judges in Texas. It 
was my patronage that he was trying to trade me out

03:46.731 --> 03:50.336
of. Johnson was a real horse trader, the best I've 
ever seen. He was cunning as a fox and a coyote

03:53.439 --> 03:57.043
combined. He was a real 100% politician. That's 
what made him effective in legislation. To him,

04:02.686 --> 04:14.478
the politics of it was all up to what he could do and 
how the people would respond.

04:14.579 --> 04:23.368
How did your role as a major carrier of legislation 
change between administrations of Presidents

04:14.579 --> 04:23.368
Kennedy and then later President Johnson? 
There's a constant evolution in that role. When I

04:28.548 --> 04:35.157
first got there with Johnson, the majority leader 
of the Senate, it was very difficult to get

04:28.548 --> 04:35.157
anything passed. I got very little passed as long 
as he was the majority leader of the Senate because

04:35.177 --> 04:40.144
he was blocking all of it. He had put the chairman in 
their positions. I was a co-author of a good many

04:44.029 --> 04:47.234
important bills. I had a role in it because if I 
introduced the bill by myself or put my name first

04:47.354 --> 04:53.322
on it, I'd get a lot of other people to put their 
names and then put mine where really in the

04:54.061 --> 04:59.848
background I was pushing it harder than anybody. 
And I got legislation passed that way but I didn't

05:00.329 --> 05:10.942
issue any statement to the press as my legislation 
because I didn't want to get snarled in the House.

05:10.962 --> 05:13.926
Now Lyndon could not block all legislation in the 
Senate. even if he didn't want it. I mean, even

05:15.766 --> 05:22.376
while he was majority leader directly, but he 
could indirectly due to his great influence with

05:15.766 --> 05:22.376
Sam Rayburn. Sam Rayburn had the house right in the 
palm of his hands. He was a terrific speaker,

05:25.981 --> 05:35.115
dynamic in his organizational skills, and very 
modest about it all the time. Didn't claim that

05:35.135 --> 05:39.762
power, but he had it, and he was such a believer in 
Lyndon Johnson. If Lyndon came over and told him a

05:40.113 --> 05:46.283
senator hadn't treated him fairly, he'd bottle 
that senator's bills up and never let any pass. So

05:46.303 --> 05:48.126
you had to think of Sam Rayburn. And so I'm 
co-author of a number of beneficial bills during

05:48.908 --> 05:58.784
the years that Lyndon was majority leader, but 
that my name first, my bills, no, I couldn't get

05:48.908 --> 05:58.784
them back up. One passed, the Cold War GI Bill. 
Lyndon and John F. Kennedy both helped me on that.

06:04.033 --> 06:06.036
Taylor Strong, Eisenhower's president, He was 
opposed to the Cold War GI Bill, and they were each

06:06.303 --> 06:11.769
running for the presidency, and they got right in 
behind him. Well, we passed it in the Senate, and

06:12.370 --> 06:15.834
Eisenhower was able to block it in the House. Tiger 
Teeth blocked it for him because the president

06:15.854 --> 06:19.458
asked him to in the House. And when Kennedy came in 
as the president, I went down to see him about it.

06:26.587 --> 06:30.191
He'd been on that committee and helped us pass it 
that time. I was telling you about it when we passed

06:30.211 --> 06:36.158
it in 57, I believe, to 31 over the Republicans in 
Eisenhower's opposition. Kennedy's answer

06:36.695 --> 06:40.540
says, yes, Ralph, but I'm president now. And then 
when Johnson became president, I went back again

06:40.560 --> 06:44.165
to try to pass it. I passed it two or three times. It 
took eight years to get it finally written into

06:45.447 --> 06:48.231
law. And Lyndon must have been reading John F. 
Kennedy's tapes. He always had those tapes.

06:53.117 --> 06:57.062
Because he looked at me and smiled and said, yes, 
Ralph, but I'm president now. When I told him he'd

06:57.082 --> 06:59.706
help me pass it. That's what took me eight years. 
The hardest, longest fight I had was to pass that.

07:03.813 --> 07:16.627
Cold War GI Bill, but I've got the tremendous 
satisfaction, it is to me tremendous, of seeing

07:03.813 --> 07:16.627
that eight million veterans at least have gotten 
an education on that bill. In what ways did your

07:16.647 --> 07:22.494
views on civil rights legislation vary from 
President Johnson's? Practically none. Okay.

07:27.399 --> 07:30.242
Practically none, we're both supportive. I don't 
think Johnson had before I got there. But when I got

07:34.324 --> 07:37.609
there, he turned around 180 degrees. He became 
stronger than he was before. The difference

07:40.372 --> 07:46.841
between us was he was in the leadership role, and I 
had very little seniority. I wasn't on the

07:47.362 --> 07:49.144
Judiciary Committee. I wasn't on the committee to 
handle the bills. So my role was merely a

07:51.427 --> 07:54.351
supportive role to support him. But where I was 
having the most influence in was on the committees

07:58.285 --> 08:26.622
i was on i was on the educational subcommittee went 
on it in january of 1958 stayed there 13 years and

07:58.285 --> 08:26.622
was author a co-author of every major educational 
bill in that time and i was having there because

07:58.285 --> 08:26.622
that committee was split one time another dirksen 
strom thurman and uh goldwater all of them in there

07:58.285 --> 08:26.622
to fight us on another bill and i was only fighting 
for those education built because I taught school

08:26.973 --> 08:33.842
three years in the rural schools of Henderson 
County. I taught briefly in the University of

08:34.242 --> 08:36.785
Texas Law School. I served four years as the 
counsel for the Texas State Teachers

08:37.506 --> 08:44.715
Association, one there. I had been on the Texas 
State Board of Law Examiners four years. I

08:48.881 --> 08:53.166
represented a bunch of school districts and 
colleges in their litigation. And during the big

08:53.483 --> 09:12.279
years that I served education, while I was 
assistant attorney general under Jimmy Allred,

08:53.483 --> 09:12.279
where this plaque the land office gave me in 
January 31st of this year, they have since audited

08:53.483 --> 09:12.279
what happened to the judgments I won in the oil 
lands of Texas. I had the land desk at four years

09:12.400 --> 09:15.205
under Allred. And the opinions I wrote that are 
still being followed in the land office, and

09:16.670 --> 09:27.609
they've given me this plaque that says that I 
enriched the permanent school fund by more than

09:16.670 --> 09:27.609
two-tenths of a billion dollars. And the whole 
size of it is four-tenths of a billion. Now that's

09:30.515 --> 09:31.857
half of it. That was the greatest educational 
contribution I've made in my life. And it's

09:35.023 --> 09:39.150
because I started off as a rural school teacher 
when I was 17. and the one teacher of rural school.

09:42.764 --> 09:47.267
My youngest pupil was six and my oldest was 25 and we 
had a ball. In 1969, you became chairman of the

09:49.120 --> 10:00.435
powerful Labor and Public Welfare Committee, 
which President Johnson stated was responsible

09:49.120 --> 10:00.435
for 80% of the legislation passed by the 89th 
Congress. What made this committee so prolific in

10:01.036 --> 10:05.141
the passage of legislation? Because of its 
jurisdictional setup. Each committee has

10:07.905 --> 10:17.457
jurisdiction over certain things, armed 
services, military bills, interior and insular

10:07.905 --> 10:17.457
affairs. over islands and over national parks and 
over Indian reservations and so forth, commerce

10:17.791 --> 10:32.012
over railroads and the Federal Railway Act and 
aviation and civil air. By jurisdiction, we had,

10:32.033 --> 10:44.271
Labor and Public Welfare Committee had 
jurisdiction over labor legislation, over all

10:32.033 --> 10:44.271
educational legislation, all health 
legislation.

10:45.533 --> 10:51.859
All veterans' education and hospitalization, 
not the pensions, that went over under taxation.

10:52.379 --> 10:58.465
But all hospital, veterans' hospital, all 
veterans' education, we had. My GI Bill was there.

10:59.666 --> 11:01.548
I could pass a proposal on that committee. And a 
number of other things. We had jurisdiction over

11:03.890 --> 11:06.452
the poverty bill. We had jurisdiction over the 
food stamp problem at first. And a number of bills

11:10.476 --> 11:13.058
like that. We had jurisdiction over so many 
things. And we came through that. Those were the

11:17.298 --> 11:25.089
things I was, those were the things I'd run for 
governor of Texas three times on to improve the

11:17.298 --> 11:25.089
education of our low standing in the union. In 
public health at that time, Texas was 46 out of the

11:25.570 --> 11:30.157
48 states. We're very low. We're still low. We're 
39th, we're 49th in the union in the size of our old

11:31.760 --> 11:36.467
age picture. And we're the richest state in the 
union. We're 49th in the union in the average

11:43.162 --> 12:11.262
payment for the dependent child i ran for governor 
on those a great disappointment for me in life is

11:43.162 --> 12:11.262
that they're still there 49th down this rich 
terribly rich state i mean terribly tremendously

11:43.162 --> 12:11.262
rich state i meant to say and we pay something like 
30 some odd dollars and i think that at this time

11:43.162 --> 12:11.262
south carolina is the only state in the western 
mississippi those two generally are they've gone

11:43.162 --> 12:11.262
up and i helped pass They put two more states in the 
union while I was there. So that didn't improve

12:14.445 --> 12:17.148
Texas standing in it. We fell from 46 to 48 and 49. 
They went ahead of Texas in those things. But we

12:23.796 --> 12:29.422
passed that legislation because that's the 
committee it came to. And we got on that committee,

12:29.702 --> 12:39.573
a bunch like myself got on it because we were for

12:29.702 --> 12:39.573
it. I'm going to stop there. A

12:41.110 --> 12:58.607
number of major political leaders have served as 
members of this committee over the years,

12:41.110 --> 12:58.607
including John F. Kennedy, Richard M. Nixon, 
Hubert H. Humphrey, Robert F. Kennedy, and Barry

12:41.110 --> 12:58.607
Goldwater. And then while you were chairman, 
Edward M. Kennedy, Walter F. Mondale, Alan

12:59.047 --> 13:05.914
Cranston, Jacob Javits, and Richard Schweiker. 
Why do you think this committee drew such great

13:07.055 --> 13:09.497
leaders? Because it was the committee that did 
things for people. It did more things for people

13:13.599 --> 13:18.264
than practically all the rest of the committees in 
there combined. And if you wanted to serve people,

13:18.765 --> 13:24.131
if you wanted to get something done for people, you 
gravitated to that committee. When I went on the

13:24.792 --> 13:29.517
education subcommittee, nobody wanted on it. And 
it was easy. I got on that with Johnson's help. He

13:33.482 --> 13:36.125
had a hard decision to make. Senator McNeely from 
West Virginia had died with cancer, and so he was on

13:39.363 --> 13:44.028
the committee. And labor was very strong for Joe 
Clark, a strong, very liberal senator from

13:45.970 --> 14:01.908
Pennsylvania, a Harvard graduate and the first 
reformed mayor, honest mayor that Pennsylvania

13:45.970 --> 14:01.908
had had since the Civil War, noted for corruption, 
one of the most corrupt city governments. He got

14:01.928 --> 14:06.113
elected on the campaign to clean up Philadelphia 
and went on to Senate. He wanted to be on that

14:06.953 --> 14:14.943
committee, and the Republicans had somebody 
else, Goldwater or somebody. I mean, this was the

14:15.103 --> 14:16.906
Democratic seat. I mean, Strom Thurmond was a 
Democrat then. They wanted Strom Thurmond on it.

14:21.612 --> 14:24.676
And Johnson, Queen of Rock in a hard place. As you go 
inside, there's the liberals and the

14:25.577 --> 14:28.000
conservatives. Well, I had just reached the 
Senate. It's been there a few months. Nobody knew

14:32.497 --> 14:34.381
really what I'd do. Now, this is Johnson. I didn't 
go around advertising what I was going to put on

14:37.548 --> 14:40.535
there. So Johnson brought up the question of 
putting me on it. Now, I think he had some ulterior

14:44.450 --> 14:46.874
motives, too. He thought being on the labor 
committee that I would alienate the people of

14:46.934 --> 14:52.342
Texas so it would defeat me. But that didn't worry 
me. I saw a chance to get on the committee that I most

14:55.526 --> 14:59.412
wanted on, education. And I got on it when I did a 
Republican senator from Kentucky, one of my

15:01.214 --> 15:13.933
friends I had in the Senate, and knew him in the past 
years, John Sherman Cooper, a great senator. He

15:14.538 --> 15:19.042
came to me and said, Ralph, what on earth are you 
getting on that education subcommittee for?

15:19.062 --> 15:20.303
Don't you know it'll beat you? When Happy Chandler 
left the Senate to be baseball commissioner, they

15:21.124 --> 15:26.309
put me on it. I'd just been appointed by the 
governor as a vacancy. It beat me at the next

15:29.091 --> 15:30.653
election. Then he became ambassador to India and 
made a great record. They came back, they put him on

15:34.136 --> 15:35.578
it. When Alvin Barkley died with a heart attack, he 
was appointed again by the governor. He went back

15:41.843 --> 15:42.604
on it. it beat him again and he came back a third time 
then got elected to put him back on he said they put

15:42.770 --> 16:07.528
me back on third time see it's just about four 
months i said yeah and he said i'm getting off and

15:42.770 --> 16:07.528
did that week i said well he said why are you staying 
i said because i came here to try to do something

15:42.770 --> 16:07.528
about education he said that's the lowest cause 
and uh the uh I said, well, I'm going to do something

16:08.403 --> 16:14.490
about it, or I'll get beat trying, one of the two, or 
die trying. Well, it had been a lost cause. The

16:16.733 --> 16:20.177
education bill had been killed for 20 years there 
in the Congress. But the Russians had put up

16:20.717 --> 16:24.642
Sputnik 1 in October of 57. People were terribly 
afraid. They'd fallen behind in science, fallen

16:26.104 --> 16:29.888
behind in mathematics, engineering. They didn't 
quite know which people without skills out, but

16:30.309 --> 16:36.756
they knew something was wrong for the Russians to 
be ahead of us. And so there was a great push to catch

16:37.529 --> 16:54.084
up, and we passed the National Defense 
Educational Act that year with seven great

16:37.529 --> 16:54.084
titles, and it covers everything from the primer 
through the 5,500 graduate slots for people to get

16:37.529 --> 16:54.084
PhDs. It was a great, one of the great breakthrough 
legislative acts in the history of American

16:54.104 --> 17:02.392
education, federal aid to education. One of the 
biggest, one historian says it's a moral land

17:02.412 --> 17:06.135
grant College Act founding the the land-grant 
colleges of which Texas A&M was one that founded

17:06.520 --> 17:36.477
under that act with federal land grants and they 
said this is great by far the greatest act since

17:06.520 --> 17:36.477
that 1862 that Lincoln signed and so that and being 
on that committee I had was able to pass a lot of

17:06.520 --> 17:36.477
legislation I did not put in my main time on the 
elementary and secondary, that's grade and high

17:37.132 --> 17:42.485
school. I saw by the time I went there that the 
average child school child had a chance to go

17:47.662 --> 17:56.069
through a public high school free, tuition free, 
that blocked him when he wanted to go to college.

17:56.189 --> 18:06.058
When I went on that committee, there were only 
three million students in college in America, all

17:56.189 --> 18:06.058
kinds of colleges, senior, junior, medical, 
everything you had above high school, just three

17:56.189 --> 18:06.058
million. That's where I put my work. That's where I 
passed the bill. That's where I had the greatest

18:09.281 --> 18:11.242
influence. I concentrated on that. And many 
others were fighting very hard over the

18:13.044 --> 18:17.668
elementary and secondary over two things. 
religion, difference of religion, parochial

18:17.648 --> 18:21.453
schools, or race. And I put my effort in on the 
higher education. It wasn't centered there. They

18:27.783 --> 18:30.867
were fighting those other issues down in the 
trenches, lower down. And I got my higher

18:31.388 --> 18:37.737
education bills through, and when I left there, we 
had 11 million people in college in the United

18:31.388 --> 18:37.737
States. That's the greatest contribution that I 
made in the Senate, I think. Now, of course, I

18:42.424 --> 18:44.346
couldn't do that by myself. I didn't do all that. 
And I think except for my Cold War GI Bill, most of

18:45.863 --> 18:53.113
the bills would have passed if I hadn't been there. 
But there wouldn't have been as many people in

18:53.194 --> 18:55.757
college. I was on the Appropriations Committee, 
too. I got on that with six years to go. And I had six

19:00.484 --> 19:06.993
years of my last six years as on the Appropriations 
Committee, 13 years on the Education Committee. I

19:07.114 --> 19:10.298
can say truthfully without boasting, I rolled it. 
I opened the doors to colleges in America so the

19:10.318 --> 19:15.145
youth of America could get inside. How do you think 
civil rights advances would have been aided if

19:17.048 --> 19:26.138
either Hubert Humphrey or Robert Kennedy would 
have been elected president instead of Richard

19:17.048 --> 19:26.138
Nixon in 1968? Oh, I think that they would have 
advanced faster, though one thing that's

19:26.158 --> 19:40.795
overlooked are the extraneous factors A lot of 
influence on civil rights. A lot of things outside

19:43.439 --> 19:48.745
the halls of Congress or the President's speeches 
had a great influence. The civil rights bill that

19:48.765 --> 20:02.560
passed when Johnson was in and got so much acclaim 
for because he really put his shoulder to the wheel

19:48.765 --> 20:02.560
on that civil rights bill and put his mark on it. And 
while I was putting mine on education, he put his on

20:03.661 --> 20:08.807
it, but it was being filibustered. And the general 
thought in the Senate was if you've got 24

20:09.158 --> 20:17.812
filibustering and you have 24 hour sessions a day, 
they need to stand up and keep talking. You can't

20:17.832 --> 20:20.717
break it if the 24 wouldn't work at it. Of course, 
they've got to have some additional votes.

20:23.661 --> 20:27.307
They've got to have a three-fifth can break it. So 
if you've got 24 active workers, they can probably

20:27.968 --> 20:31.113
stall the bill. And they thought that civil rights 
bill was stalled. And then the Selma riots took

20:34.379 --> 20:36.482
place. It was shown on television all over the 
United States with policemen riding those

20:36.968 --> 20:47.941
marchers trying to march from Selma to 
Montgomery, Alabama to petition Governor

20:36.968 --> 20:47.941
Wallace. They tried to ride them down, they rode 
them down with horses, turned fire, turned police

20:48.542 --> 20:55.130
dogs, and was tearing and pulling them down the 
street. That so shocked the people of America. The

20:58.012 --> 21:18.081
whole nation was so shocked by this that the 
pressure had plopped like that, that the whole

20:58.012 --> 21:18.081
idea that the filibusters were left standing 
alone, and it turned all the doubters, all the

20:58.012 --> 21:18.081
undecideds, and all those that were maybe with 
them but weren't telling anybody that, it turned

20:58.012 --> 21:18.081
them over for a patient. The second one was the open 
housing bill, the real estate, the homes, open

21:18.101 --> 21:25.332
houses, the people of all races couldn't 
discriminate against it. Now, that one was really

21:25.833 --> 21:27.495
bogged down, because the real estate lobbyists, 
in fighting the civil rights bill, there was no big

21:28.977 --> 21:34.583
money back at that time. Airlines didn't want 
segregation. Trains and buses didn't want

21:37.987 --> 21:50.140
segregation in transportation because they're 
just too expensive and unwieldy to try to have a

21:37.987 --> 21:50.140
black and white section and have a plane, et 
cetera, and all those interests. But when you got

21:50.160 --> 21:52.082
to housing, That broke the real estate interest in 
the vast billions of dollars, scores of billions

21:52.585 --> 21:59.234
of dollars involved. But it would affect the 
values of the homes they were selling, the value of

21:59.254 --> 22:05.242
real estate was involved in them. The big money was 
on the side of blocking that bill. And I think it's

22:08.687 --> 22:13.112
virtually blocked when Martin Luther King was 
assassinated in Memphis. And when he was

22:13.132 --> 22:21.023
assassinated, it turned sentiment around just 
like the earlier Selma routes turned down.

22:22.538 --> 22:25.522
turned the civil rights bill around. And while 
Hubert Humphrey and Robert Kennedy would have

22:25.542 --> 22:43.488
been strong exponents of faster advance in civil 
rights, at the same time, without those

22:25.542 --> 22:43.488
extraneous things happening, the first civil 
rights bill would not have moved fast. In time, it

22:43.548 --> 22:45.530
would have become low. In time, the opening 
housing would have become low. But it would be

22:48.935 --> 22:50.557
stalled for years. It would take years and years. 
Those events catapulted them right onto

22:52.643 --> 23:02.592
the law books. You once had a campaign slogan, 
Ralph Yarborough fights the people's battles and

23:02.612 --> 23:07.796
he wins them. Was this really an accurate count of 
your victories in the Senate? And what do you see as

23:12.360 --> 23:14.802
your main victories in the Senate? And if any, did 
you have any shortcomings? Did the Senate oppose

23:18.645 --> 23:21.908
any of your major legislation?

23:25.347 --> 23:35.823
Yes,

23:25.347 --> 23:35.823
the main victories I won were in the field of 
education, and I think composite on higher

23:25.347 --> 23:35.823
education. We had to pass a higher education 
facility bill. Most colleges don't use college as

23:38.867 --> 23:46.238
a generic term of university, college, junior 
college, and all. Very few have the financial

23:46.258 --> 23:53.349
resources that Texas and A&M University in Texas 
have, dividing the permanent fund. Very few.

23:54.507 --> 24:02.137
Harvard and a few great ones like that, Princeton, 
Yale, Stanford, California, some do.

24:05.883 --> 24:17.258
So without the money, even though we increased the 
college enrollment about four-fold, unless they

24:05.883 --> 24:17.258
had money to build the buildings, they couldn't 
have taken care of it. So we passed the higher

24:17.896 --> 24:37.282
education facilities bill to give money to public 
colleges, both to direct money or lend it to a

24:17.896 --> 24:37.282
church-related school, let them build by paying 
interest on it, paying it back, and giving it to

24:17.896 --> 24:37.282
independent schools like Rice and Stanford, 
where they had no church connection. The

24:37.322 --> 24:47.515
constitutional innovation against government 
financing churches, we did not have gifts to

24:37.322 --> 24:47.515
church-related schools. And it enhanced college 
education greatly. I think I made a major

24:52.728 --> 24:58.917
contribution there, I think, leaving one in the 
Senate on that. Because, as I say, most of those

24:58.937 --> 25:04.545
bills, if I hadn't been there, I think would have 
passed in some form. But it depends on who's out

25:04.565 --> 25:09.392
there working on them. I've had members of the 
House tell me, I'd go over and talk to House

25:09.492 --> 25:15.520
members. You're the only look up in amazement. 
You're the only senator who ever darted my door.

25:21.046 --> 25:25.031
Why, a senator from my home state wouldn't even 
come over here at the house side to see me. I worked

25:25.051 --> 25:26.373
on it. The police guards after we started bumming 
things in Washington had to have everything

25:26.633 --> 25:32.080
guarded. You just go in one door. We worked openly 
the first few years. Staff would come back and work

25:35.725 --> 25:40.812
till midnight, and then it wasn't safe any longer 
to be attacked on the streets. And so I lived right

25:41.413 --> 25:46.560
across the street from the Senate office 
building, my apartment. And the guards told me I

25:47.148 --> 25:53.274
was the only senator in those closing years who 
came and worked in his office at night. He takes

25:53.294 --> 25:53.935
work. They work like you see that in lawsuits. If 
you don't prepare, if you don't work at it, you're

25:56.518 --> 25:59.481
going to get beat. And I worked at those laws. I 
didn't interview civilians or leave. You had to go

26:04.766 --> 26:06.048
see people. You had to see people that hadn't 
decided on it and try to get them to agree with you

26:06.068 --> 26:11.714
individually. As soon as the House members, I 
worked everywhere. What do you think was the major

26:15.295 --> 26:22.565
legislation that you worked for that didn't pass? 
The major one that I worked for that didn't pass?

26:26.590 --> 26:33.219
The major one I worked for that didn't pass was the 
space program and the satellites up there. The

26:33.259 --> 26:42.552
government spent $25 billion on that and financed 
it, and I thought they ought to remain in

26:33.259 --> 26:42.552
government ownership and to pass the bill to... to 
create a corporation to turn it over to, to give

26:43.038 --> 26:49.996
them away to a corporation, a special 
corporation, a government created. I fought

26:50.016 --> 26:54.989
that, filibustered on that, and I filibustered or 
failed. That's the only time I filibustered a bill

26:55.029 --> 26:58.498
while I was there. who were coming along pretty 
well to one of our main filibusters, jumped up and

26:58.985 --> 27:05.973
called Mansfield a liar, and it wasn't true. He 
wasn't that bad. He hadn't taken any part in it. He

27:08.796 --> 27:12.120
was sitting there as majority leader all the time. 
And just like the Jewish prayer, the thing, and

27:12.140 --> 27:24.394
made an infuriate to all the senators, and 
virtually one of the filibusters, virtually a

27:12.140 --> 27:24.394
boat cow filibuster, always wondered why he did 
it. Do you feel that your views while you're in the

27:24.454 --> 27:27.878
Senate changed? over time? Well, the 
opportunities changed. See, when I went there, I

27:33.447 --> 27:40.036
went there wanting on the Appropriations 
Committee because I lived here at Austin. I knew

27:40.096 --> 27:45.323
where the power was and I'd served in the Army in 
World War II. I'd been in West Point a year. I had

27:47.647 --> 27:51.472
been a staff officer on the men's division for two 
years and 11 months. I went in wanting on the Armed

27:51.852 --> 27:56.599
Services Committee and had all those posts over 
Texas. I was a reserve lieutenant colonel then,

27:56.815 --> 28:00.859
and I wanted to own that. Well, Johnson was on it. 
You couldn't be on the same one, the same party, the

28:01.920 --> 28:04.823
same state. You might have your different 
parties. And I wanted to own the Appropriations

28:07.145 --> 28:10.749
Committee because they're the ones dividing the 
money. That meant enough political power to do

28:10.809 --> 28:14.553
something and put that money. If you own the 
Appropriations Committee when the pie is cut, you

28:14.573 --> 28:22.080
can get to share for your people that you vote for 
all these years in campaigns. Well, Johnson was on

28:22.499 --> 28:26.385
that, too, so that was, I was barred. And I took what 
I could get in the way of the steering committee of

28:26.405 --> 28:50.582
recommendation committees, and I took what I 
could get, but fortuitously, I got on one that I

28:26.405 --> 28:50.582
wanted very badly, labor and public welfare, 
because aside from the public welfare, the food

28:26.405 --> 28:50.582
for the starving, I wanted that, and the fair shake 
for labor, I wanted, above all, education and

28:26.405 --> 28:50.582
health. the health condition of Texas so bad. Now, 
what I did for education helped the education

28:52.930 --> 29:02.585
nation and helped health in Texas, but it didn't 
push Texas up ahead of other states. It was even for

29:02.665 --> 29:05.449
the whole nation, but it meant much more. And so 
that was a thing that I never dreamed I would have,

29:06.170 --> 29:12.099
and I went there. I thought other senators, senior 
to me, it'd be years before I could get on it. I was

29:16.105 --> 29:19.911
very much interested in parks, but the Interior 
and Insular Committee Generally went to Western

29:20.228 --> 29:25.513
Center because they had the Indian reservations, 
the national parks, everything there. I had a very

29:26.253 --> 29:36.182
good fortune there of passing more national park 
legislation than anyone else, I think, in the

29:26.253 --> 29:36.182
Senate while I was there. I wasn't on the 
committee, but Senator Scoop Jackson, the

29:36.602 --> 29:42.708
chairman of the school committee, was a good 
friend of mine. His wife, he was down here during

29:42.748 --> 29:48.232
World War II, met a young lady from Georgetown, 
married her. His wife was from Georgetown, Texas.

29:50.553 --> 29:51.895
He'd help me in every bill. The chairman of the 
parks committee, subcommittee, out in Bible,

29:52.395 --> 30:01.927
wasn't for my bills because he was Lyndon's good 
friend and I was the author of the bills and they

29:52.395 --> 30:01.927
were trying to block them. Scoop Jackson made him 
bring my bills out of that subcommittee. I never

30:05.331 --> 30:11.498
heard in my whole years in the Senate, I never heard 
any other chairman of the full committee order. a

30:11.950 --> 30:15.554
chairman of the subcommittee under him to bring 
those bills out. I was a very great friend. But I

30:18.857 --> 30:31.491
ended up as the author of the board of the Mountain 
National Park, the Padre Island National

30:18.857 --> 30:31.491
Seashore Park, and the first big picket bill ever 
introduced. I wasn't able to get that passed while

30:31.691 --> 30:36.576
I was there, except in the Senate the last few 
months. It was too late to get it to the House. But I

30:38.718 --> 30:41.181
kept working on it and served two terms as chairman 
of the big big association in Texas and we finally

30:41.465 --> 31:09.312
the whole group of us I just wanted that but the fact 
that I'd been there I knew members of that

30:41.465 --> 31:09.312
committee in the house went around Republicans on 
the house committee told me they'd help me get my

30:41.465 --> 31:09.312
bill through this land only bill was up there 
lobbying on that for left and locked to stay in

30:41.465 --> 31:09.312
lobby for money and I wasn't up there lobbying for 
any corporations anything so they were pretty

30:41.465 --> 31:09.312
sympathetic

31:13.983 --> 31:18.348
the Civil Rights Reform in the Senate, especially 
from other Southern Senators?

31:20.831 --> 31:27.759
Well, they, I didn't have much sympathy for them 
when I'd come out in the Education Bill. They were

31:28.220 --> 31:28.760
mad. See, Johnson promoted this, well, with Dick 
Russell and all. I wouldn't sign the Southern

31:33.145 --> 31:38.451
Manifesto when I went down. And that, Johnson 
promoted it. They knew he was running for

31:39.132 --> 31:40.734
President. They'd excuse him. See, he got himself 
excused. But he did, he was trying to dynamite in

31:43.615 --> 31:45.837
other bills. He knew what I was working on in 
education. He was trying to dynamite, not

31:47.819 --> 31:58.069
necessarily against him, but he was supposed to 
bypass them because I hadn't supported him,

31:47.819 --> 31:58.069
wasn't supporting him, the president didn't. And 
so he got to be president. And then I was supposed to

32:01.752 --> 32:06.356
change the courses in midstream and lose my race. 
And furthermore, once he got to be president, he'd

32:06.757 --> 32:12.222
sign any bill I could pass. I was past them. I was 
getting all my bills signed. Of course, he had

32:16.503 --> 32:18.368
claimed credit when he signed them. This is my 
great society. Turned around, one of my

32:19.892 --> 32:24.304
educational bills gave me a big old smile and says, 
Ralph, 80% of all of my great society legislation

32:24.892 --> 32:29.400
goes through your committee. And he had all those 
members of the House and Senate press turn around

32:29.420 --> 32:37.113
and smile at me, saying, I've got your stuff and 
I've got it and you haven't. But the bills are low.

32:40.057 --> 32:41.961
The main thing was to cut the bills off. I didn't 
quibble with him. I didn't get out and make

32:43.042 --> 32:47.831
speeches and say he's trying to steal my credit. I 
did not stir up a quarrel with him. I wanted the law,

32:49.647 --> 32:52.731
the main thing, what did you pass? And the Dallas 
News admitted after I was defeated, of course,

32:52.831 --> 33:02.103
that I'd passed more national legislation than 
any other senator in the history of the Senate in

32:52.831 --> 33:02.103
Texas. I was still there when they wrote that, so 
the staffers and I went over to the Library of

33:02.123 --> 33:09.333
Congress where they have the records and got their 
help. You'd call them during the Senate to dig out.

33:12.096 --> 33:15.421
They dug out, and I hadn't passed more national. 
Dallas News said national. boondoggle and get a

33:17.356 --> 33:22.863
bridge for your district, you know, or something, 
a new post office building. That's a bill, but they

33:22.883 --> 33:24.706
weren't counting those. They counted something 
that affected the whole nation, like education

33:24.766 --> 33:28.871
and health. I've got some in this year of that in the 
materials I gave you that you'll find in what I've

33:30.674 --> 33:38.284
said, but it's substantial. The early 1970s was a 
time of great scandal exposition, primarily

33:40.373 --> 33:47.439
Watergate and the Sharpstown scandals. You've 
always been an outspoken fighter of corruption.

33:51.803 --> 33:58.910
Do you think that this corruption is as pervasive 
in recent years as it was in the 60s and 70s?

34:00.871 --> 34:03.394
Probably more so, but probably more subtle. Not as 
brazen, not as open, not as brash. And a lot of

34:06.817 --> 34:10.380
things that were corruption then are not now. The 
common cause got this pact law passed so the

34:10.597 --> 34:17.586
corporations can contribute millions. It's 
illegal then for corporations to contribute to

34:17.666 --> 34:21.611
political campaigns. They've legalized 
corruption. It's not corruption anymore, but

34:23.714 --> 34:30.863
it's legal for them to give everything they want to 
by the organization of pacts to candidates. They

34:30.884 --> 34:33.567
spend as much as a half million or a million dollars 
on one candidate and one congressional race over

34:34.475 --> 34:37.900
and over. And they left them generally when they 
did that. Most of those got elected. And the

34:42.087 --> 34:48.076
influence of the vast wealth is incomprehensibly 
greater now than it was when I was there. The

34:49.158 --> 34:52.023
special interests have a... And they've even 
turned around. They call poor people and they call

34:52.063 --> 34:58.753
the old-age pensioners and the poor people and the 
hungry the special interests. And the big papers

34:58.773 --> 35:01.798
swallow it because they're big interests too, you 
know. They got that money while they sold the

35:02.217 --> 35:09.809
Dallas Times Herald years ago when it wasn't worth 
near as much as it is now for $97 million. And when

35:09.829 --> 35:15.157
that interest rate went up under Carter and 
Reagan's 20%, they didn't agree. That's what was

35:15.217 --> 35:18.102
causing the inflation. The high interest rate was 
the most inflationary thing in our economy. They

35:21.387 --> 35:27.516
were blaming it on labor, and they were blaming it 
on all kinds of things, these appropriations.

35:28.188 --> 35:32.454
wife and I was there running when they were beating 
me in 70 said I busted the budget. The total budget

35:33.175 --> 35:36.460
was only $200 billion. It's $850 billion. It's 
jumped up now $900 billion. Reagan's busting it

35:40.446 --> 35:48.098
with this ungodly expenditures for everything 
that you can shoot on Earth and now going out into

35:40.446 --> 35:48.098
space dumping something to shoot at. He's got to 
have a space war. Somebody shouldn't have let him

35:51.282 --> 35:55.849
see that motion picture of Star Wars. Who do you 
think is the examples of, you know, people who have

35:57.905 --> 36:07.440
been elected by PAC money, especially like in 
Texas? Well, Phil Graham is one. Bill Williams,

36:11.225 --> 36:14.611
Helms in North Carolina. A number of those 
senators that you, they published figures, five,

36:14.631 --> 36:19.118
six, seven, eight million. The PAC money, Benson 
spent about, lowest estimate i've ever heard of

36:22.525 --> 36:44.145
what he's been against me is six and a half million 
and i'm not talking about just out of clear blue uh

36:22.525 --> 36:44.145
friends of mine but know something about the 
expenditure of money and i've always called it six

36:22.525 --> 36:44.145
and a half million because some people working in 
his campaign down there heard that figure and quit

36:22.525 --> 36:44.145
and joined us last week left him said i just can't 
stomach this buying elections like this. A lawyer

36:46.118 --> 36:52.908
in West Texas, a bunch of right students, head over 
here when they're talking about what the budget

36:46.118 --> 36:52.908
was for his campaign, six and a half. Since then, 
I've been told it's closer to eight million, and by

36:53.448 --> 37:03.984
people in Houston that don't admit they had 
anything to do with it. But, one of the most

37:04.325 --> 37:11.415
prominent lawyers in Texas, if I call his name, 
being known all over Texas, stopped me on the

37:04.325 --> 37:11.415
street about two years ago, Texas City, and said, 
I'd known him in the law school at the University of

37:12.998 --> 37:24.171
Texas there when I was a senior law, and he was a 
junior law, and I'd known him. He was one of the big

37:24.191 --> 37:25.973
shivers men on the other side. Stopped me and said, 
Ralph, you've been claiming all the time that that

37:26.494 --> 37:33.181
1956 governor's race was stolen from you. He said, 
you may not know it, but the 1954 one was too. And

37:38.007 --> 37:40.710
that's where he was raising a lot of the big money at 
my point. in the 54th. So we know, I had a man right in

37:42.692 --> 37:48.840
the horse's mouth that was raising the money on the 
other side. And I knew they were raising that from

37:48.860 --> 37:51.223
70. Two races in which the most money, most 
millions were raised. There were millions in each

37:54.767 --> 38:02.617
campaign, but most millions raised against me, 
and I never was able to raise a million in a

37:54.767 --> 38:02.617
campaign. I was lucky to get up towards the end. I 
could get up towards the half a million before

38:05.201 --> 38:08.104
that. One time when I was elected to the Senate, In 
1957, I spent $80,000, most of it borrowed. And

38:15.536 --> 38:19.461
when I got up there, one of the senators asked me 
what I spent, and I told him. He turned around and

38:19.481 --> 38:22.163
walked off, just saying, you're a liar. He didn't 
believe it. I never told anybody in the city that

38:22.964 --> 38:25.607
that's what I spent. Or I said I couldn't raise any 
money, and he just spent a miniscule amount, and

38:25.727 --> 38:30.573
never would tell them. They wouldn't believe it, 
because they'd all spent even from small states

38:30.593 --> 38:34.677
hundreds of thousands. What do you think should be 
done to fight graft in public office, especially

38:36.293 --> 38:46.227
in Washington and Austin?

38:46.247 --> 38:47.789
It takes education of the people. It takes 
candidates that are willing to run and put their

38:49.091 --> 38:56.041
neck on the line and denounce it and expose it. And 
it's a tough issue to get elected on unless you've

38:56.722 --> 39:05.254
got somebody indicted or something that you would 
like the public to show that people They're not apt

39:05.572 --> 39:07.314
to believe it. Or they see a lot of graft in their 
local officers and they think that's everybody in

39:07.814 --> 39:13.620
the office is crooked. That's a, the big interest, 
don't mind people believing they're buying all

39:13.660 --> 39:21.148
this crooked because that excuses their account. 
It

39:21.368 --> 39:27.715
takes constant education. It's a different 
world. In the world in which I grew up, I'm 81, I'm

39:30.097 --> 39:35.443
14, the time I grew up, accepting money from 
somebody, passing bills was a disgrace. That was a

39:39.863 --> 39:46.974
man, the highest disgrace you could have was 
taking money under the table from the public

39:39.863 --> 39:46.974
office. It's not people that don't favor it now, 
but they kind of wink at it. And they say, well, they

39:56.007 --> 39:58.491
all do that. With this big contribution, such a 
high percentage, you win, they have to take it. But

40:03.298 --> 40:04.620
on the other hand, They don't have to take it under 
the table for a bill. Now they know in advance how

40:07.840 --> 40:12.945
they stand on these bills and raise the money and 
put them in. It's legal to contribute the money

40:13.626 --> 40:15.848
with the PACs. They know in advance how they're 
going to vote, so they don't pay them money after

40:16.108 --> 40:22.355
they get in the vote. And the number of senators 
when I was there who would take money under the

40:22.375 --> 40:31.404
table, the influence was not high at all. And the 
staff knew who it was, and they talked badly clubs

40:34.958 --> 40:41.206
of their own, the staff, the Democratic Club of 
Staffers. And they gossip about the senators, the

40:41.226 --> 40:52.700
senators that think he can do something under the 
table, that thinks he can have an affair with a

40:41.226 --> 40:52.700
woman other than his wife and not be known. It's 
known around, they don't go talking to the press,

40:52.720 --> 40:59.328
but they know it all over the Senate, nothing but 
that. The staff find out, they're around, so many

40:59.348 --> 41:04.695
of them watching everything. I don't mind 
spreading a little scandal on the senator. So if

41:08.559 --> 41:16.712
he's taking money under the table, and as I say, I 
don't think a high percentage did. I think the

41:16.833 --> 41:21.480
percentage he did was relatively small, but a lot 
of them were very influential. The reason

41:21.500 --> 41:26.228
probably the money was after, they had the 
influence to pass or to stop folks. What do you

41:28.182 --> 41:36.733
think can be done to elect public officials who 
represent the interests of the common man rather

41:28.182 --> 41:36.733
than the special interests of big business? Well, 
I think organizations to help in that are growing.

41:43.242 --> 41:45.444
The consumer groups in Texas are growing. They 
were practically unknown when I was running, very

41:45.485 --> 41:50.671
small in my last race. The Sierra Club has 12,000 
members in Texas now on conservation issues, on

41:52.820 --> 41:58.448
environmental issues. And if they were in Texas 
while I was running, they were virtually unknown.

42:04.157 --> 42:16.134
The Audubon Society is here, but they wouldn't 
lobby or take part in politics because they would

42:04.157 --> 42:16.134
lose their tax exemptions, the tax exempt 
organizations that got out and contributed. So

42:16.154 --> 42:22.303
the organizations that would support the kind of 
things I was interested in, conservation,

42:23.093 --> 42:30.321
environmental issues, protection of wildlife, 
the creation of parks, was just practically

42:23.093 --> 42:30.321
non-existent. I'm taking Texas as the best case 
example now. The organizations, my goodness, if

42:33.744 --> 42:42.113
I'd had an organization for the third of that many 
members, I don't think I would have been the

42:33.744 --> 42:42.113
future. But to be mobilized, it takes some money to 
mobilize people. You've got to have money enough

42:46.438 --> 42:51.403
to reach them to let them know how you stand. And it 
still takes some money
