WEBVTT

00:01.904 --> 00:03.466
What you want to get down is some of the facts. You 
probably in this course of study, you've been

00:04.668 --> 00:10.275
there and you've studied a little bit about the 
history of Vietnam. Okay, I got my orders to go to

00:10.295 --> 00:13.479
Vietnam and left right after New Year's. And it was 
cold, it was cold in January in New York. And I flew

00:20.889 --> 00:29.160
from New York to San Francisco and got in there at 
night to this one particular building in San

00:20.889 --> 00:29.160
Francisco International Airport. Kind of waited 
around with another 150 other guys that were going

00:30.558 --> 00:36.483
to Vietnam. Some for their second tour and some for 
their first tour like myself. Lots of young guys?

00:42.728 --> 00:43.609
Yeah, sure. Lots of guys my age too by now, like 27, 
28. A lot of career military guys, sergeants,

00:48.013 --> 00:54.038
officers. And this is our job. We're going to work. 
This is what we were trained to do. This is what we

00:58.222 --> 00:59.603
were motivated to do.

01:03.042 --> 01:04.504
that and I believe that today. Those guys got on 
that plane, nobody put a gun on them. I could have

01:09.589 --> 01:11.652
resigned my commission at the airport and gone 
home. That was my job. That's what I was trained to

01:13.414 --> 01:14.675
do. That's what I signed on to be. I got on that plane 
to San Francisco and it was a commercial airplane

01:16.737 --> 01:21.903
with stewardesses and everything. It was a 
charter. Transglobal or something. It was a

01:25.807 --> 01:27.609
charter fleet. You just like flying TWA or paying 
them. They served us the little meals and We got to

01:33.029 --> 01:41.682
fly to Hawaii and we got there very early in the 
morning to Hawaii. I remember how Hawaii smelled

01:41.922 --> 01:44.646
of flowers. And we just walked around the airport 
while we were through the plane. It was like two

01:46.809 --> 01:48.251
o'clock in the morning. We're going off to war and 
the airport's deserted. No brass bands or

01:50.955 --> 01:53.158
anything. We're going to war. This is in January of 
68. And from there we flew to Hawaii.

02:08.737 --> 02:11.339
It's a little tiny manhole cover out in the middle 
of the Pacific. And they were refueling just this

02:13.061 --> 02:17.224
Navy installation to refuel the plane there. 
Watch the sun come up out of the Pacific. It's

02:18.686 --> 02:19.687
something I'll never forget. And from there, we 
flew to right in Vietnam. I remember the

02:24.611 --> 02:26.593
stewardess, we landed at Ben Hoa Epe. The 
stewardess says, welcome to Ben Hoa, Vietnam.

02:29.515 --> 02:32.618
Everybody said boo. Just like welcome to 
Cincinnati, or welcome to New York, or welcome to

02:32.778 --> 02:36.722
San Antonio. She says, welcome to Ben Hoa, 
Vietnam. And she did wish us all good luck in our

02:39.533 --> 02:42.358
tours of duty. And then that same plane would take 
out another plane load of guys who were rotating

02:43.720 --> 02:48.007
back to the States. We got off the plane, it was 
during the day, and the first thing that struck you

02:49.930 --> 03:00.187
was the enormous heat and humidity and the dust and 
the smell of Vietnam. We got in, it was in the

03:00.207 --> 03:04.073
evening, they put us, got us some supper. I forget 
where we had, so we had something to eat and then

03:04.340 --> 03:07.104
crashed. They had some temporary barracks there 
for us, just wooden shacks really. We crashed and

03:12.692 --> 03:16.037
had an outdoor latrine in there. I think it was 
washed up a little bit. I knew what, as an officer

03:19.502 --> 03:24.269
you had orders directly to a unit, so it was just a 
matter of hooking up. The next morning there was a

03:26.292 --> 03:33.503
two and a half ton truck and we all going up to 
division headquarters, 25th Division

03:26.292 --> 03:33.503
Headquarters.

03:36.031 --> 03:37.352
And we all threw our gear. We put some fatigues on. 
We had stateside fatigues, not jungle fatigues.

03:40.536 --> 03:47.443
We put some fatigues on, threw the rest of our gear 
on the back of the truck, and off we went up Highway 1

03:40.536 --> 03:47.443
from Ben Hoa to Cu Chi. And that was my first 
exposure to Vietnam. I was sat in the front. I was

03:52.708 --> 03:55.872
seeing a guy on a truck, so I rode in the front with 
the driver. He had an M16 with one clip of

03:56.452 --> 04:00.076
ammunition, 18 rounds. That was the only weapons 
we had on this truck. And we just drove up the middle

04:02.799 --> 04:05.802
of that road, 25 miles. at Coochee Divisional 
Headquarters, just like we were driving down

04:06.490 --> 04:12.716
Interstate 35. I mean, there was a lot of civilians 
and people running around, and we had to blow the

04:12.736 --> 04:20.544
horn a lot to get everybody out of the way. The 
driver was a young fellow, enlisted man. He said,

04:23.107 --> 04:24.809
oh, this damn thing's almost over. What happens? 
He'd hide in the hair of Charlie in weeks, months.

04:27.972 --> 04:29.393
Hadn't been mortared or rocketed. Nobody shot at 
him. It's been quiet. Of course, we didn't know

04:31.955 --> 04:34.758
that they were infiltrating and getting ready for 
that type of offensive. They were all hiding out in

04:34.778 --> 04:36.260
the jungle. But we drove up to the divisional 
headquarters, just bigger than Dixie, 20 guys on a

04:37.481 --> 04:42.728
truck and one gun. Anybody want to take us out, they 
could. Got to the divisional headquarters, I was

04:47.974 --> 04:53.140
assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 14th Infantry as 
their signal officer. Well, I drew my gear and an

04:55.823 --> 04:59.447
M16 rifle, sign for some equipment, because as I 
said, I had to sign for cryptography equipment.

05:05.795 --> 05:09.459
You know what cryptography equipment is? What 
that is, is it's automatic coding and decoding

05:09.639 --> 05:14.605
machines for communications. Like a cryptogram. 
Yeah, okay, just like that. And even a battalion

05:18.050 --> 05:23.056
that we had, so I had to check everything on the sign 
for it. And I had a repair shop that would fix the

05:23.076 --> 05:27.561
radios and stuff back at the battalion.

05:30.730 --> 05:59.877
They had taken a brigade up there and made a forward 
base up there near the Cambodian border, had an air

05:30.730 --> 05:59.877
field on it that we had built out of the jungle and 
that was the big jungle up there and we drove in a

05:30.730 --> 05:59.877
convoy and every morning a convoy would leave the 
division headquarters to go to this base camp and

05:30.730 --> 05:59.877
every morning the first people out on the convoy 
was a company of mechanized infantry because the

05:30.730 --> 05:59.877
bad guys would ambush and they'd have to fight 
their way up the road every morning. And we were in a

06:01.527 --> 06:06.012
cowboy, and that was my first dust, I won't forget 
the dust in January. I still have it. I have a

06:06.753 --> 06:11.157
triangular bandage that's part of a first aid kit. 
I made a cowboy-style bandana just to keep the dust

06:11.618 --> 06:14.621
out. And I went up there to join the battalion. We'd 
get shot at occasionally up there. I remember the

06:23.550 --> 06:26.033
rats up there, huge, as big as dogs. I was in a 
foxhole when a rat jumped on my stomach, so we left a

06:27.599 --> 06:36.748
little candle on it and the rats didn't like light, 
but if you put all the lights out in the foxhole, the

06:27.599 --> 06:36.748
rats would come in there. Big rats, huge rats. 
Everything was big up there. They had pythons

06:39.331 --> 06:49.141
crawling across the airfield, they had rats as big 
as, we have, you know, cats here in the house, rats

06:39.331 --> 06:49.141
as big as that. Big. Mosquitoes. Hmm? Mosquitoes 
were a problem. No, there probably were no

06:52.565 --> 06:54.687
mosquitoes. Scorpions as big as crawfish. Yeah, 
big black scorpion. But that's, that's not real

07:02.388 --> 07:06.654
important. We got up there and everybody's 
getting ready for this big truce. It's gonna have a

07:11.701 --> 07:14.264
ceasefire, very intense. And we're right up near 
the Cambodian border and we had artillery, we had

07:14.384 --> 07:22.615
airfield, we had all sorts of infantry units out 
there. I mean, it was a good, Good place ever. Now

07:28.119 --> 07:34.746
being a Signal Corps guy, we had switchboard and we 
had radios and we also had a multi-band radio just

07:28.119 --> 07:34.746
like you're using here. You could get everything. 
We listened to AFN Saigon. And that night, first

07:40.032 --> 07:48.462
night of the Tet ceasefire, a young soldier came 
and said, Captain, you need to come on down to

07:40.032 --> 07:48.462
Switchboard Bunker and listen to this. Okay. So I 
got out my foxhole and what's going on? There's

07:55.957 --> 07:56.818
AFN. All you can hear is this guy saying, stay in 
your BOQs, stay in your barracks. And you hear

08:02.746 --> 08:04.589
gunfire in the background. You hear airplanes. 
And this is on a radio station in Saigon. We thought

08:08.614 --> 08:09.716
it was a joke. I said, what's going on? He said, all 
hell seems to have broke loose in Saigon. So I got on

08:16.705 --> 08:17.807
the brigade. I called my buddy at the brigade, 
Sigma. I said, what the hell is going on? Because

08:20.650 --> 08:23.314
the brigade had more communications with Saigon 
than we had. He said, something crazy's going down

08:24.138 --> 08:26.301
in Saigon. We don't know just yet. So I said, well, I 
better tell the old man. I got the colonel up and

08:30.746 --> 08:33.930
says, something hit the fan down in Saigon. I don't 
know what's going on there. What the hell? It's a

08:36.534 --> 08:37.915
ceasefire. There's supposed to be nothing going 
on there. Well, it went about an hour later. You

08:43.723 --> 08:44.524
know, this is dead at night. It's about an hour 
later. We finally get the word. Ceasefire's off.

08:47.648 --> 08:53.335
We start shooting our mortars and artillery 
starting what they call H&I, harassment and

08:47.648 --> 08:53.335
interdicting fire. by the time, there wasn't a bad 
guy within 50 miles of us all down around the

08:55.778 --> 09:02.306
side-gun area kicking ass. Well, we stayed up 
there another couple of days and we got the orders

09:03.127 --> 09:16.543
to tear down that base camp and return back to 
Coochee, to our divisional headquarters, or

09:03.127 --> 09:16.543
because of all the things that had happened, it was 
that big Tet Offensive. So, yeah, I was in the Tet

09:16.803 --> 09:20.047
Offensive, except the bad guys worked right past 
it. And we got down to, the divisional

09:24.550 --> 09:29.596
headquarters, which had been kind of like a 
country club, and that place was torn up. I mean

09:29.616 --> 09:41.571
there were shell holes all over the place, and I 
had, talking to some of the guys that had been down

09:29.616 --> 09:41.571
there, they were feeling sorry for us being on the 
Cambodian border, and they cut off our help.

09:41.591 --> 09:50.983
Although the Tet Offensive was a military defeat 
for the enemy, was, it was, wasn't it also a

09:41.591 --> 09:50.983
psychological defeat for the United States? Not, 
not us. Every time we came into contact with

09:54.166 --> 09:57.092
Charlie, we kicked his ass up. So the Tet Offensive 
to you was not a bad sign? No, we whipped him. We

09:59.857 --> 10:00.438
whipped him. No, we didn't feel bad. We just said, 
geez, what are these people doing here? Don't they

10:05.247 --> 10:08.092
realize they can't do this? Because every time we 
would catch him like that, we'd get blown away. We

10:11.759 --> 10:13.583
had such enormous firepower. So you still felt 
that the war was winnable after the Tet Offensive?

10:17.740 --> 10:21.183
Did you see it as the tide changing? Oh, heavens no. 
In fact, you know, you're not going to believe

10:23.586 --> 10:30.673
this, but we would wish that he would do that more 
often. Try to come against us in a big offensive

10:31.554 --> 10:34.697
like that. Come out of those underground tunnel 
networks. Come out of the jungle. Because every

10:40.182 --> 10:43.425
time he did that, we would stomp the snot out of him. 
You see that? For every one of our cows, we must have

10:47.407 --> 10:49.650
taken 20 of his. Never mind all this crap you hear 
about inflated body counts. I sure am piled up

10:53.456 --> 10:55.019
there like cordwood. They'd go in there, they'd 
have an initial success against two MPs guarding

10:57.442 --> 11:08.940
the front of a PX somewhere, and they'd commit 50 
guys, and the next thing you know, we'd gang up on

10:57.442 --> 11:08.940
those basses and take them out with a thousand 
guys. You understand that? So, in a guerrilla war,

11:11.664 --> 11:14.629
whenever they... break off the guerrilla war and 
move to the conventional warfare stage, they got

11:14.812 --> 11:22.801
the snot stomped out of them. They got killed, big 
time. You know, there's no way to tell how many of

11:26.405 --> 11:34.914
those people we killed during that Tet Offensive, 
that first one. No, there's no telling.

11:38.578 --> 11:42.102
But everything, every even small success like up 
north in

11:46.672 --> 11:47.773
We took everything back. So do we see that as a 
turning point in the war? Yeah, we're saying, gee,

11:52.498 --> 12:01.187
if these guys are going to keep this particular 
strategy up, there's not going to be any soldiers

11:52.498 --> 12:01.187
left up north. You see? Do you understand that? And 
that's the thing that bothers me when I see Walter

12:03.889 --> 12:11.717
Crankcase and Dan, whatever his name is, saying 
this was a turning point.

12:14.633 --> 12:16.015
the defeat of America. Bullshit. That's not true. 
Do you think it had a lot to do with them being there

12:18.319 --> 12:21.143
and showing it on TV? How important do you think the 
media was? Oh, enormous. You see, those guys

12:24.629 --> 12:32.502
communicated to the American people that we had 
been whipped in Vietnam during the Tet Offensive.

12:33.744 --> 12:39.092
And the American people said, oh my God, this is, oh 
my, oh, this is so terrible. Oh, All our generals

12:41.043 --> 12:45.368
are telling us that they went into war and these 
guys take over the American embassy. My God. Stop.

12:49.053 --> 12:58.264
But from a professional soldier standpoint, if 
those guys would have done it all the time,

12:49.053 --> 12:58.264
eventually there would be nobody left because 
they got such a bad military whipping.

12:58.325 --> 12:58.925
Politically. Oh, did they win politically? 
Everything that they lost, they more than made up

13:03.631 --> 13:09.919
for in the streets and on the television sets and 
newspapers of America.

13:12.937 --> 13:13.618
Think about that. Their victory in the Tet 
Offensive wasn't in Vietnam. It was in Brooklyn

13:17.801 --> 13:27.830
and

13:17.801 --> 13:27.830
San Francisco and in Temple, Texas, on the streets 
and in the living rooms of America. That's where

13:27.890 --> 13:28.771
they won. Because there was such a biased news 
reporting of Vietnam War. They didn't talk about

13:33.736 --> 13:37.719
the big victory. They showed the kids getting 
killed over there. The kids are talking about the

13:41.219 --> 13:43.442
American soldiers. You see the American guys 
getting shot at. Do you think they have a

13:45.125 --> 13:51.053
responsibility, the media has, for showing the 
public, or do you think they should have been kept

13:45.125 --> 13:51.053
out of the war? Well, like in World War II, there was 
a national effort towards winning the war. It even

13:56.761 --> 13:58.403
existed in the media. Look at the movies, eye 
bonds. Look at the news reporting, the radio

14:02.549 --> 14:07.416
broadcasts. Everything was geared towards the 
war efforts. Here, in Vietnam, that wasn't the

14:09.113 --> 14:11.877
case. There was no popular support in the media for 
a military victory in Vietnam. Why do you think

14:21.169 --> 14:21.890
that?

14:25.535 --> 14:26.396
I can speculate. Would you like me to speculate? 
Sure.

14:32.464 --> 14:36.910
Essentially, those individuals who were 
professional soldiers were what we would call

14:32.464 --> 14:36.910
today conservatives. Now, John F. Kennedy, Thai 
conservatives,

14:38.105 --> 15:02.053
what was prevalent in the arts, and the media is 
part of the arts, is kind of a liberal attitude,

14:38.105 --> 15:02.053
what we would call liberal today, I don't know what 
you called it back then, but it was more of a

14:38.105 --> 15:02.053
pacifist, accommodate, patronize,

15:05.476 --> 15:10.121
non-violence, roses and sunshine. If you only 
love somebody long enough, you'll win them over,

15:10.181 --> 15:15.888
all kinds of stuff. And that filtered down into the 
media's approach towards the interpretation of

15:15.908 --> 15:23.977
the war. You know, a guy like Walter Cronkite, or a 
guy like Dan Rather, or a guy like Tom Brokaw, he

15:24.558 --> 15:30.805
wasn't...

15:34.089 --> 15:35.230
The inflection that they... what they show, how 
they describe it could have a profound effect upon

15:35.682 --> 15:42.711
how the American people saw the war. Just, just an 
inflection of the war. Now I didn't, I didn't see

15:45.434 --> 15:49.019
all the coverage because I was over there where 
they're making the movie. I wasn't back over here.

15:52.183 --> 16:03.377
But the, the general consensus was amongst the 
professional soldiers of Vietnam is that what got

15:52.183 --> 16:03.377
back to us later on after it was over, after we had 
come back from our tour, is that The American

16:04.049 --> 16:14.407
people were getting kind of a one-sided view of the 
war, like somehow it was an exercise in futility

16:04.049 --> 16:14.407
that we could never defeat these people. You could 
never win over there. It's not true we could. We had

16:18.954 --> 16:20.557
the power to do it. And nobody likes frustration. 
Nobody likes to be frustrated. Your sons and

16:27.168 --> 16:33.597
husbands are going over there and they're getting 
killed, but not for any real purpose, not for any

16:27.168 --> 16:33.597
real good purpose. So that kind of upsets you. 
You're usually going to get tired of hearing about

16:35.400 --> 16:37.163
it. And every night you're seeing some kid getting 
smoked on TV. Today in Vietnam, X number of GIs got

16:41.429 --> 16:46.416
smoked, and this, that, and chicken. And living 
from a couple TVs now, not black and white, with the

16:46.516 --> 16:53.226
blood, and the screaming, and the bullets, and the 
blowing up. And you're getting this seven days a

16:53.246 --> 16:54.648
week. At six and at ten, Never mind the newspapers, 
never mind Time magazine. That's just where I get

17:01.712 --> 17:04.836
right down to the television stuff. That's the 
main way that people receive information. And

17:08.720 --> 17:20.192
Living Color, I mean, today in Vietnam, when I had 
the footage, it wasn't six months ago, and it

17:08.720 --> 17:20.192
wasn't censored by the government. Guys, 
whatever, you know, old Vietnam, you'd be

17:20.892 --> 17:24.276
surprised. I was a signal officer, right? So I was 
always hanging around with the Chinese

17:25.835 --> 17:27.877
headquarters. So I was a newsman around, doing 
something. After a while, you get tired of it. What

17:33.044 --> 17:35.587
kind of biased piece of reporting are you going to 
do today? You just want to give us a break. So yeah,

17:39.192 --> 17:46.301
did the media have a profound effect on the 
eventual disposition of the conflict in Vietnam?

17:47.303 --> 17:49.966
It was the controlling factor. I call it the media 
war, if you want to call it that. Do you think they

17:51.745 --> 17:56.651
had a right to do that, or do you think they were out 
of... Oh, they sure had a right to do it. Do you think

17:56.671 --> 17:58.674
they were out of line? Do you think that they... No, 
I think those people were being honest to

18:00.296 --> 18:07.805
themselves, but I think they have a distorted view 
of what was going on over there. So you do agree that

18:07.846 --> 18:09.768
they should have been over there? Should have been 
over there. Because, see, this thing had never

18:13.613 --> 18:21.583
really elevated itself to a real war, and if it had 
been a real war, where the total power of the

18:13.613 --> 18:21.583
nation... was committed to total and 
unconditional defeat of the enemy. And their

18:28.216 --> 18:30.860
outlook on the war was a lot different. It would 
only last a couple of weeks. But this thing was an

18:34.545 --> 18:36.427
ongoing story. And more and more Americans are 
getting killed now. The leadership, you know, the

18:40.753 --> 18:49.224
President of the United States, 
Commander-in-Chief of all the military, the boss

18:40.753 --> 18:49.224
doesn't know what he wants to do. So at least 
they're uncertain in the rank. The soldiers are

18:52.073 --> 18:55.156
doing the best job that they can. Every time they 
catch Charlie, they twist his tail. They really go

18:57.959 --> 19:02.244
after him. Charlie is a euphemistic expression 
for the enemy. And... We've studied a lot about the

19:06.809 --> 19:16.219
leadership and the problems, such as the one-year 
tour of duty doesn't give you much time to learn

19:06.809 --> 19:16.219
your manner. Make...

19:21.217 --> 19:22.558
attachments with your troops? Or, or get you 
acquainted with the surroundings? Do you agree

19:25.661 --> 19:26.462
with that? Well, that's a theory. It said the Vien- 
American didn't have ten years experience in

19:28.104 --> 19:35.571
Vietnam and had one years experience ten times, 
yeah. But that's not true because amongst the

19:35.591 --> 19:41.958
non-commissioned officers and amongst the 
officer corps, most of these guys were

19:35.591 --> 19:41.958
careerists. It wasn't like in World War II where a 
guy had just been drafted. Most of the, uh,

19:47.896 --> 19:52.762
non-commissioned officers, sergeants, and 
officers that I served with had been in the Army

19:47.896 --> 19:52.762
before Vietnam started. So these guys were 
committed towards the military service. Number

19:55.865 --> 20:09.441
two, it doesn't take you a whole lot of time to get to 
know 40 guys or 100 guys or who's ever working for

19:55.865 --> 20:09.441
you, especially if they're also professional 
soldiers and good soldiers. I can say that the men

20:11.424 --> 20:16.890
that served under me and the people that I served 
were all professionals. whether they had been in

20:17.123 --> 20:20.326
the army for six months or 16 years, there'd be no 
difference. They did their job very, very well as

20:20.486 --> 20:22.988
they were trained to do.

20:27.492 --> 20:29.915
Should the tours of duty over there have been 
longer? No, I think considering the fact that

20:29.975 --> 20:46.810
there wasn't very much popular support at home for 
the war, it would have been really hard to stay over

20:29.975 --> 20:46.810
there indefinitely until you got killed and 
wounded to the point they had to be evacuated, so it

20:29.975 --> 20:46.810
was nice to have something to look forward to 
getting out of there for a while because that You

20:47.633 --> 20:54.241
know, it's not like World War II where you're 
getting all these great letters from home and

20:47.633 --> 20:54.241
everybody's proud of you and all that stuff. 
People at home didn't know what the hell was going

20:54.261 --> 20:56.243
on. All they got was a distorted picture from the 
media. So they were worried. You were worried

21:00.307 --> 21:01.649
about your folks at home. You were worried about 
yourself. Gee, you know, the government's so

21:02.990 --> 21:05.673
uncertain about what's going on here. I don't want 
to get killed for nothing. But you still try to do

21:07.536 --> 21:10.959
your job.

21:12.762 --> 21:17.167
So should we have just stayed over there forever 
and ever and ever like in World War II? No. I don't

21:18.127 --> 21:18.708
think so. I don't think it would be a good idea. The 
war was pretty simple. There wasn't a whole lot of

21:23.692 --> 21:28.177
sophistication to it. What you tried to do over in 
Vietnam was kill the bad guys. That was it. That was

21:33.882 --> 21:34.563
the job. We had the ground. We had the terrain to 
belong to us. They were the interlopers. All they

21:41.890 --> 21:43.151
had to do was find them and kill them. It was hard to 
find them, though, wasn't it? Pretty sneaky,

21:46.314 --> 21:47.155
yeah. tunnels and jungles, and sometimes they 
disguised themselves to be civilians. What a

21:53.014 --> 21:55.717
surprise. So, so it wasn't a terribly 
sophisticated, well, like in a communications

21:55.757 --> 22:01.683
standpoint, everybody talked about radio. Yeah, 
didn't the United States spend a lot of money on

22:02.324 --> 22:13.555
sophisticated equipment and smart bombs and 
little devices that would sense a person that

22:02.324 --> 22:13.555
looked like the IBM computers? Didn't they map on 
those? Yeah, sure, but I mean, we were using that

22:17.712 --> 22:21.898
technology in places other than Vietnam, too. We 
used like those sensor devices, which were highly

22:23.140 --> 22:25.844
classified. They were used in Czechoslovakia to 
monitor, they were dropped over Europe to detect

22:27.005 --> 22:35.638
Russian troop movements and all that kind of 
stuff. It's what they call an unintended ground

22:35.658 --> 22:40.705
sensor, and all it does is, it's like a little 
seismographic. Something goes past it, it gives

22:40.725 --> 22:46.453
us a signal thing, and the skies look like little 
bushes and little trees and stuff. I mean, that's,

22:46.754 --> 22:55.605
that's a little gadgets, but the, and all of this is 
giving information that somebody's walking

22:46.754 --> 22:55.605
past, whether it's a water buffalo or a platoon of 
Viet Cong, you don't know. So you, yeah, there was a

22:55.625 --> 23:03.055
lot of tech, like the M16 being a high-tech weapon, 
right? It was made out of plastic and it had

23:03.075 --> 23:12.007
die-cast parts and a tiny little high-velocity 
bullet, but it, you know, it's still a lagoon that

23:03.075 --> 23:12.007
shoots people. Ain't no different than something 
Napoleon had. So... But it wasn't a terribly

23:16.572 --> 23:19.335
sophisticated war.

23:24.619 --> 23:28.363
The whole trick was to find out where the bad guys 
were and then smoke them. Kill them. That's all.

23:31.546 --> 23:34.108
You mentioned the career soldier a lot. I'm sorry. 
Yeah. But

23:35.670 --> 23:43.677
in a lot of the books we've read, they mention that a 
lifer was this worst kind of soldier. to lead you

23:44.433 --> 23:54.328
because of the careerism and the attitudes of, to 
be selfish motives when you're leading your men.

23:54.348 --> 23:55.530
Did you experience any of that? Did you see that? 
Yeah, some of the guys would say, oh, you're a

23:57.053 --> 24:00.077
lifer. I'd say, yeah, sure, I'm a lifer. If you want 
to say a lifer, I'm a professional soldier. It's my

24:03.202 --> 24:04.384
job. My return was, would you like to be taken, led 
into combat by an amateur or professional? But

24:10.977 --> 24:18.227
some career soldiers, did you ever see them making 
totally selfish moves? Some of the books we read,

24:18.307 --> 24:30.062
they wouldn't tell their men about the Viet Cong 
waiting or the camp because they wanted them to be

24:18.307 --> 24:30.062
extra alert and they didn't want them to maybe shy 
away from the camp. No, I didn't see any of that. A

24:34.027 --> 24:35.770
bad leader, did you ever see that? Oh, sure. Not 
just a stupid one, but someone with the wrong

24:37.732 --> 24:40.356
motives. No, no, no. No, I didn't say that. I saw a 
lot of bad leaders in the sense that leadership is a

24:42.574 --> 24:51.468
technical and a personal attribute. You have to 
have no technical things. You have to know how to

24:53.371 --> 24:54.252
lead. How do you maneuver a company? How do you 
maneuver a battalion? How do you plan a military

24:57.617 --> 25:01.183
operation? Yeah, to be a leader you have to have 
some technical training. Then you have to have

25:04.748 --> 25:07.851
personal characteristics that are very 
important. Some guys had it more than others. They

25:09.193 --> 25:10.354
were good leaders and bad leaders. You have good 
brain surgeons and bad surgeons. You have good

25:13.157 --> 25:18.983
college professors and you have not so good 
college professors, right? That's just a human

25:19.243 --> 25:20.184
trait. It has nothing to do with being a soldier. 
And if you weren't good at what you did, you didn't

25:22.506 --> 25:27.371
do it for very long. The boss would find somebody 
else to do it. You take a simple job like a guy whose

25:32.011 --> 25:53.339
responsibility was to be a platoon leader, and he 
went out and he did something wrong, when he should

25:32.011 --> 25:53.339
have been able to figure out how to do it correctly, 
he was usually sent back and he was in charge of the

25:32.011 --> 25:53.339
mesh kit repair company or something. Or some guy 
who was reluctant to take, to lead his men

25:53.359 --> 26:00.448
properly, he was relieved that somebody else was 
put in there. Senator, you don't see careerism as a

26:01.205 --> 26:03.767
major problem? Well, what do you mean by 
careerism? Careerism as... Let's make the most of

26:05.469 --> 26:09.773
this situation because it's the only war we've 
got. Yeah, I think as a professional soldier, they

26:12.315 --> 26:19.362
all thought about the impact that this conflict or 
war would have on their career. You have to think

26:19.402 --> 26:20.463
about that.

26:24.206 --> 26:26.929
Well, for example, there was a passage in a book... 
I think you want to do well, though. Because if you

26:28.745 --> 26:30.828
do poorly, it's going to screw up your career. So 
you want to do well. Okay, there was a passage in our

26:33.913 --> 26:49.339
book about one military leader who, he was so set on 
having a high body count of Vietnamese that when

26:33.913 --> 26:49.339
the medevac came in, instead of putting his 
wounded on, he wanted to put the dead Vietnamese

26:33.913 --> 26:49.339
on. I mean, did you ever see him? Never, ever. Never 
saw anything like that. I saw a guy's, commanding

26:55.795 --> 26:59.260
officers who would bend over backwards to do 
things for their men. Like get them extra chow or

27:00.061 --> 27:02.624
get into new weapons. When they new weapons came 
out, they want to get it first or to get them a

27:03.465 --> 27:09.033
three-day break somewhere or an extra R&R. I'm 
talking about those guys that really busted their

27:09.053 --> 27:13.860
buns for their soldiers. I saw that more than I saw 
nonsense like you're talking about. I don't know

27:18.045 --> 27:20.689
who reported that, but I've never seen anything 
like that.

27:24.213 --> 27:25.695
How about fragging? No, none of that went on when I 
was there. That was later on when America pulled

27:28.999 --> 27:36.328
back from the combat role and the guys were just 
sitting around the barracks and had nothing to do.

27:36.709 --> 27:39.172
The drugs were a big problem later on too. Did you 
see him when you were there? Yeah, I'd be out in the

27:41.575 --> 27:51.688
jungle in a fire base or something and one of my 
soldiers would come walking by and he's got a bag of

27:41.575 --> 27:51.688
marijuana and he had a big enough choke of horse and 
I said, what the hell do you got there? He says, he

27:52.394 --> 27:54.456
just bought it from the mama sign over here. I said, 
what'd you give for it? He says, a couple of peas,

27:56.118 --> 28:00.642
like $2 for a pound of local wheat. He says, you're 
not going to, all right, dump it out, man. Oh, come

28:03.725 --> 28:04.546
on, Captain. I said, dump it out. And usually guys 
who did that were real zorches anyway. I mean, this

28:08.130 --> 28:12.734
is a guy who, his job in the battalion was to go 
around and burn the cans of shit. And so we got rid of

28:13.575 --> 28:20.302
the, some yo-ho like that, some rum diddy and a 
goo-goo wasn't worth anything. He'd have a job

28:20.402 --> 28:21.523
like that. No, and, uh, fragging? Nah, I didn't see 
that. There was not one, one instance of that. And

28:27.852 --> 28:31.960
it really is hilarious in that movie, the platoon 
had us two sergeants, one was trying to kill the

28:27.852 --> 28:31.960
other. You never saw that. You know, later on, in, 
uh, I guess in the early 70s, it started having a lot

28:33.844 --> 28:42.260
of fragging incidents, and I heard about that. Who 
was doing it? These were the guys... They were,

28:45.044 --> 28:46.847
they really weren't soldiers. They were just 
civilians who were there against their will and

28:46.867 --> 28:55.461
they just were rebelling against the symbol of 
authority and they were petty anyway. They'd

28:55.721 --> 28:58.566
throw a hand grenade under a sleeping lieutenant. 
I mean, that takes a lot of guts to do that. Those

29:03.934 --> 29:05.096
guys are never soldiers. A soldier would never do 
that. A real soldier would never do that. Speaking

29:09.042 --> 29:12.047
of soldiers, what did you think about the armed 
forces? I didn't see a whole lot of it, but they were

29:13.293 --> 29:18.459
okay individually. They weren't,

29:18.679 --> 29:24.145
they weren't as good as Americans.

29:26.948 --> 29:29.191
They weren't as good, they weren't as highly 
motivated. Believe it or not, they were fighting

29:29.231 --> 29:31.013
for their own country. We were, but the American 
soldier was a better motivated combat soldier

29:31.053 --> 29:37.681
than some of the Arlins I saw. Now a good buddy of 
mine advised a was a signal advisor to an Arvin

29:41.930 --> 29:49.538
division, and I went over to see him, and he said, 
what is the kind of hair you got here? These guys are

29:49.558 --> 29:51.179
a little loose. Because American soldiers were, 
believe it or not, forget all the Hollywood

29:52.441 --> 29:59.888
movies, pretty well organized, pretty well 
structured. They could do something. You snap

30:02.611 --> 30:06.455
your fingers and you can get 24,000 guys to move in 
one direction at one time. The Arvins were just a

30:07.636 --> 30:10.179
little goofy-looky about that. They were just... 
And I don't know is if it's as much an Arvin problem

30:13.300 --> 30:21.870
or it's just a cultural problem with all of that 
part of the world. The North Vietnamese were not

30:21.890 --> 30:24.853
supermen either. They kind of goofed up a few 
times, so. So I think, did I have a lot of contact

30:27.937 --> 30:32.342
with the Arvins? No. Did I see them? Did you ever 
fight with them? No, no, no. They, sometimes like

30:35.586 --> 30:38.329
we got hit one night and We were 150 soldiers with 
three tubes of 105 millimeter artillery. We got

30:44.420 --> 30:48.666
hit by a North Vietnamese regiment of about a 
thousand. We fought all night and we just, it was a

30:48.686 --> 30:52.191
hell of a battle. And then that morning when the sun 
came up, an ARVN unit came in to sweep the jungle to

30:53.032 --> 31:04.929
flush out any wounded

30:53.032 --> 31:04.929
or anything like that. But you know, they were 
okay. They were alright. You know, a lot of those

31:09.545 --> 31:16.715
Army soldiers were guys that, until they became a 
soldier, couldn't read or write. They went out in

31:16.735 --> 31:18.678
the boondocks working on a rice field. A lot of 
Saigon cowboys, I wonder how they avoided the

31:20.942 --> 31:23.626
draft.

31:26.329 --> 31:31.177
And a lot of people in America avoided the draft, 
too, for some reason. Do you have any combat

31:33.159 --> 31:36.625
experiences you'd like to talk about? Any 
particular... horrifying ones, or ones that

31:39.953 --> 31:46.461
stand out as, did you ever feel like you were a hero? 
No, no, you don't. It's a son of a bitch to get shot

31:50.506 --> 31:51.968
at. I see friends blowing up. I see a lieutenant, 
but he's riding in a jeep, and he was just heading

31:54.911 --> 32:05.664
out of a fire base, and a remote-controlled bomb 
went off under his butt and blew him to a million

31:54.911 --> 32:05.664
pieces. Nice young fellow. Cut him right in the 
hand. I was sitting on top of a bunker out in a

32:10.177 --> 32:16.045
dried-out rice field with another captain, and he 
and I were smoking Kent cigarettes. And the only

32:17.386 --> 32:21.512
tree in the whole area was the one we were sitting 
under, and a sniper opened up on it. And it was the

32:23.194 --> 32:26.879
only casualty I sustained in the Vietnam War. What 
happened? Well, the bullets went right over the

32:29.482 --> 32:30.824
top. The guy was firing an AK-47, and he wasn't a 
very good shot. He wasn't an American marksman,

32:33.588 --> 32:35.370
that's for sure. He cut loose at all 30 rounds and 
went over our heads. Because I remember the leaves

32:38.358 --> 32:41.221
coming down as the bullets popped through the 
tree. And this captain and I immediately fell

32:42.602 --> 32:45.064
forward. And as I fell forward, the cigarette 
broke off and the hot end of it went up my

32:45.084 --> 32:51.490
nose. Oh, that really got me angry. Boy, that hurt 
like hell. If you don't think a hot cigarette up

32:54.532 --> 32:59.076
your nose doesn't hurt. And I knew where the 
bullets were coming from, you could tell. So I went

33:02.019 --> 33:04.101
over there with a .50 caliber machine gun. I 
cranked it and they fired one round and the gun

33:04.161 --> 33:06.863
jammed. I picked up an M16, fired one round, and 
that damn thing jammed. So I grabbed my .45 out,

33:11.567 --> 33:15.934
fired one round, and that damn thing jammed. I 
threw the .45 down, sat down, lit up another

33:15.954 --> 33:20.862
second, said, the hell with it, you can go home. So 
you didn't kill him? No, I sent a bunch of guys, they

33:21.924 --> 33:26.611
go out that wood line, they found a stack of empty 
brass that was still warm. That was it. They

33:28.574 --> 33:29.997
brought the brass back in a hat. In contrast to 
seeing your friends die, how did you feel when you

33:31.559 --> 33:35.145
killed... When I killed somebody, I never killed 
anybody. You never killed anyone? Mm-hmm. How's

33:42.873 --> 33:43.393
that? Doing my job. I was a signal launcher. So you 
were never out there in the field fighting? Yeah,

33:49.841 --> 33:51.763
mm-hmm. But it's not like you and I sitting in this 
room, we would smoke. Never did that. In fact, very

33:55.548 --> 33:57.029
few guys ever did that. Very rarely did that 
happen. And I saw a lot of dead North Vietnamese,

33:59.152 --> 34:03.056
hundreds and hundreds, and I didn't know that our 
boys had killed. But I never pulled a trigger on

34:04.218 --> 34:05.799
myself. A captain It's not my job to go out there and 
stick a bayonet in somebody. Do you think you'd

34:10.118 --> 34:13.081
have a different attitude now if you had actually 
killed people? Well, see, when you say kill, I pull

34:14.002 --> 34:18.868
out a gun and shoot you, that's killing. I get on the 
radio and call an airstrike and there's two tons of

34:18.888 --> 34:22.872
napalm on it. That's a little distant. So yeah, I 
guess I've been responsible for the death of

34:26.236 --> 34:29.139
people over there. But if they had stayed home in 
North Vietnam, they wouldn't have gotten into

34:33.395 --> 34:36.278
trouble. Do I feel bad about it? No. What about the 
innocent South Vietnamese? War's hard. War's

34:44.425 --> 34:45.526
really tough, you know. People get killed in the 
war. I don't feel any worse about that than the fact

34:48.628 --> 34:54.373
that we took out Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Dresden, 
Hamburg. You know, in Hamburg, thousands and

34:55.374 --> 35:00.819
thousands of civilians perished in bomb shelters 
and firestorms. You know how they died? It melted,

35:02.487 --> 35:04.591
the intense heat. Now do I feel bad about that? Sure 
I feel bad about anybody getting killed. But

35:10.941 --> 35:12.364
that's what war is all about. That's what war is

35:12.484 --> 35:19.536
all about. Okay, um... That's why you should never 
undertake a war. Halfway. Halfway, precisely. So

35:27.682 --> 35:35.031
would you say that was our problem with the war, is 
that we didn't commit fully? Yeah. Not the

35:36.332 --> 35:40.257
leadership or the conventional versus 
guerrilla?

35:47.125 --> 35:50.989
I don't know how I can make this point clear. But 
life in America during the Vietnam War was damn

35:52.876 --> 35:59.882
good in America. There's cars, there's plenty of 
cars and everybody was, we had TVs and plenty of

35:59.902 --> 36:08.230
work and making good money. Wow, life is great. 
Lots of leisure time, terrific vacations. The

36:14.976 --> 36:18.139
dollar was king, you know, four marks to the dollar 
in Europe. Life in America was good except for one

36:19.400 --> 36:21.702
little thing. Every so often, somebody you knew 
came home in an aluminum coffin.

36:33.216 --> 36:45.690
It's almost as if the price of the prosperity that 
America enjoyed during the Johnson years, the

36:33.216 --> 36:45.690
Great Society, it's almost as if the price for that 
was paid with blood in Vietnam. I've got a

36:46.491 --> 36:48.534
suspicion about that. I'm not entirely sure that 
that's correct, but I got a sneaky feeling that

36:53.255 --> 37:09.939
that quality of life and the great social programs 
that Johnson put into effect during the real big

36:53.255 --> 37:09.939
bill in Vietnam was not paid for with the blood of 
American lions in the jungles and the ice fields of

36:53.255 --> 37:09.939
South Africa. Now, that'd be something for you to 
take a look at. Everybody thinks about Johnson as

37:13.464 --> 37:16.869
the Vietnam president, but he was a great society. 
He was the New Deal phase two. He's going to pick up

37:18.892 --> 37:20.955
where FDR left off. He's a protege to Franklin 
Delano Roosevelt. And he saw this as his golden

37:23.579 --> 37:27.405
opportunity to really make a difference in 
American life. And that damn Flanagan, that was to

37:28.327 --> 37:31.973
be a non-war, but I think that's what paid. What? 
For the first break. Deemployment, you know. Oh,

37:38.164 --> 37:43.212
so you think that... You think that can of 
C-rations got to the American soldier in a foxhole

37:38.164 --> 37:43.212
free? No, somebody had to pay for it and put it 
there. Somebody had to put it in a little tin can and

37:46.738 --> 37:49.603
put it in a box and then ship it. A war is a great 
builder of prosperity at home. Look at World War

37:56.190 --> 37:57.131
II. The depression in America didn't end until 
World War II started.

38:03.059 --> 38:21.042
I got a funny feeling that if some historian were to 
take a hard look at it, maybe you're going to take a

38:03.059 --> 38:21.042
historian and a sociologist who have been 
studying the society

38:03.059 --> 38:21.042
from an analytical standpoint,

38:03.059 --> 38:21.042
that The war in Vietnam created greatly to the 
prosperity that America enjoyed during the same

38:21.747 --> 38:28.175
period of time that the war was going on. Got a funny 
feeling about

38:29.396 --> 38:35.543
that. Um, if you, do you have, would you like to add 
anything else or can, I'd like to ask you about how

38:35.564 --> 38:43.333
and why you came home. Well I came home because my 
wife got real sick. And the Red Cross, I was due to

38:47.650 --> 38:52.415
come home in January, I got a call in December 
saying to get home. Red Cross and Telegram. It was

38:54.918 --> 38:57.160
right after you were born. Right after you were 
born. And Mama got sick, she had a problem and the

39:01.826 --> 39:08.293
Red Cross said to get her home. So I left a month 
early, after 11 months. I was out of combat for all

39:10.956 --> 39:16.662
intents and purposes though because I was back at 
the division headquarters and I was a radio

39:10.956 --> 39:16.662
systems engineer. That's a fancy job for a guy who 
just fooled around radio. I was a staff officer

39:22.808 --> 39:24.511
then. I spent nine months in combat and two months 
behind a desk. I

39:28.696 --> 39:36.266
got the telegram at 8.30 in the morning and at one 
o'clock I was gone. I packed my bags and I left all my

39:36.847 --> 39:39.070
gear there. I took one suitcase and that vase up 
there, see that vase in the middle? That's from a

39:43.676 --> 39:47.982
Buddhist temple in Saigon that the tanks were 
gonna crush. It's a beautiful vase. That's the

39:51.144 --> 39:52.526
only souvenir I brought home. I took about 20 
pictures in a year somewhere, I don't know where

39:52.546 --> 39:57.671
they are. I came home, not by any organized means. I 
came, I

40:02.136 --> 40:07.942
was wearing my jungle fatigues, all dirty and 
everything. Even though I was a desk officer, it

40:07.962 --> 40:11.286
was hot and everything.

40:16.700 --> 40:18.942
Got on a helicopter to Town Center Air Base. 
Grabbed a cargo plane from Town Center to the

40:19.143 --> 40:21.665
Philippines. Sat in a chair for 24 hours at Clark 
Air Force Base in the Philippines and grabbed a

40:22.726 --> 40:31.095
commercial flight to Hawaii. I remember getting 
off the plane at Hawaii, 8.30 in the morning. And

40:36.301 --> 40:38.844
I'm still in the same closet I've been wearing for 
three days now. Got a beard and everything. Going

40:42.428 --> 40:43.669
to a coffee shop. in the airport and all these 
civilians looked at me like I wasn't there, like I

40:44.982 --> 40:50.987
was invisible. I sat at the counter in a coffee shop 
with all these ladies with their blue hair and

40:51.668 --> 41:04.359
their muumuu's and their flowers and they're lazy 
getting ready to go back to their states after a

40:51.668 --> 41:04.359
beautiful Hawaiian vacation, like there wasn't 
even a war on. That hurt you? No, it didn't hurt me,

41:05.440 --> 41:09.643
it just made me realize that most civilians didn't 
care. As long as the war didn't affect them

41:10.804 --> 41:14.888
personally, they didn't really care about it. I'm 
sitting there in the coffee shop and everybody's

41:16.673 --> 41:24.605
eating their pancakes and their fresh pineapple 
and it was gorgeous, a beautiful coffee shop in the

41:16.673 --> 41:24.605
airport. And I said to the waitress, I said, look, 
it's 8.30 in the morning, I'm just coming back from

41:24.805 --> 41:28.711
Vietnam. Can I please have two boilermakers? I'd 
say a glass of beer and a double shot of whiskey. She

41:36.103 --> 41:37.585
says, Captain, you got it.

41:45.395 --> 41:55.388
And I slept on a plane from Hawaii back to the 
States, got into San Francisco, and that plane

41:45.395 --> 41:55.388
from Hawaii to San Francisco was continuing on 
with the same flight crew to New York. And the

41:57.891 --> 42:02.137
stewardess said, God bless him, they had seen a lot 
of guys coming. They put me in the plane there, and

42:03.299 --> 42:08.225
they covered me up with blankets and everything, 
and they gave me a two-steak dinner. They gave me a

42:09.186 --> 42:13.512
couple of shots of bourbon, and I said, we'll wake 
you up when we get to New York, because I was pretty

42:09.186 --> 42:13.512
whacked out by The plane was empty. And these are 
the same students that have been shuttling guys

42:17.994 --> 42:22.000
all back and across the Pacific now for years. And I 
wonder what those students could have to say about

42:24.043 --> 42:29.872
how many guys they took and how many guys they 
brought back and what the difference was. I wonder

42:30.473 --> 42:32.055
what that had. I don't know what they thought. 
After I got back to New York, that was the biggest

42:34.378 --> 42:37.363
surprise of my life. I got off the plane at JFK or 
LaGuardia, I forget which one it was. LaGuardia

42:41.449 --> 42:42.230
Airport. Yeah. It's

42:46.313 --> 42:55.647
like 6.30 in the morning and all these businessmen 
are catching a shuttle flight to D.C. and stuff

42:46.313 --> 42:55.647
like that. Here I'm getting off the plane in jungle 
fatigues. And it's cold in New York in December.

43:02.657 --> 43:05.060
And these guys don't even see me. Not one of them 
came up to me and said, hey, thanks for what you're

43:05.080 --> 43:09.407
doing. Just like they didn't even want to 
acknowledge the fact that I was there. I felt

43:12.691 --> 43:13.873
pretty low. Then did that hurt? Wow, that hurt, you 
know. See all these very nicely dressed

43:17.252 --> 43:27.913
businessmen with their suits and their camo hair 
coats and their briefcases and their shiny shoes,

43:17.252 --> 43:27.913
going about their business, because that's what 
all the shuttle flights leave out. Going to

43:27.933 --> 43:30.658
Boston, going to Philly, going to DC. All these 
businessmen and not one person came over to me or

43:32.061 --> 43:36.469
even, even as I passed them, So I went in the 
bathroom, it was kind of early, the bathroom at the

43:38.339 --> 43:42.102
airport, and I cleaned up. I washed a little bit and 
shaved, and I had some civilian clothes in my

43:42.163 --> 43:46.186
suitcase. I put those on because I didn't want my 
wife to see me in my dirty old fatigues, all smelly

43:46.246 --> 43:55.735
and nasty.

43:55.755 --> 44:03.923
And I grabbed the cab to the apartment, and the 
Puerto Rican cab driver, and I had to give him

43:55.755 --> 44:03.923
directions. Nice guy. He didn't say anything to me 
either because he didn't know who the hell I was.

44:10.520 --> 44:12.423
I got to the apartment and my wife wasn't there. She 
had gone to the bakery to get some, but my

44:12.443 --> 44:17.691
mother-in-law was there, her pop, she was there. 
And oh my God, she was so happy to see me. They were

44:19.153 --> 44:19.814
all relieved. And then mommy came up and she was 
feeling pretty sick, but I could tell she was

44:19.915 --> 44:26.985
enormously relieved. But she had had a baby while I 
was gone. And we had fresh bread and real coffee and

44:33.836 --> 44:37.742
sat in the kitchen. We didn't talk about the war 
over there. We just talked about the family

44:40.792 --> 44:42.954
catching up on all that stuff. There was not much of 
a homecoming. My family was happy to see me. I

44:50.802 --> 44:52.103
remember seeing Jennifer when I left her. She was a 
tiny little baby, three, four months old, and now

44:52.143 --> 45:00.191
she was wearing dresses and had long hair, and it 
was really quite exciting. Then later on that

45:00.892 --> 45:06.277
afternoon, my folks came from Staten Island to 
Queens with my other daughter. I didn't see her as

45:06.437 --> 45:08.539
tiny. I think about three or four months old. It's 
like,

45:11.728 --> 45:17.156
what went through my mind was all that was behind me 
now. Do you think that your life, how do you think

45:17.776 --> 45:22.263
Vietnam changed you as a person? Not at all. Not at 
all? No. See, I was a professional soldier. When I

45:27.971 --> 45:34.180
spent eleven years in the Army, and Vietnam was 
only one tenth of that, roughly ten percent of my

45:27.971 --> 45:34.180
military service was spent in Vietnam. I think 
what had more impact upon my life was leadership

45:40.160 --> 45:42.464
school when I was making OCS. I think being a father 
had more impact on my life than being a Vietnam

45:44.127 --> 45:51.260
soldier. Did you feel like people didn't 
understand you or couldn't relate to you or what

45:52.762 --> 45:58.132
you'd experienced? No, I didn't expect any 
civilian to understand what a soldier's been

45:58.312 --> 46:02.960
through has been a combat. No civilian could 
understand it. So I didn't feel special. Did you

46:07.229 --> 46:08.471
feel foreign to people? Like you couldn't, did you 
feel like you had changed at all to where people...

46:14.059 --> 46:19.867
I was the same guy I was when I went there.

46:19.887 --> 46:20.628
No, it had no effect. And that's another thing, I 
see all these guys who were traumatized by the

46:21.609 --> 46:25.955
Vietnam experiences. I wonder if they're really 
being sincere about that. I'm sure some of them are

46:28.018 --> 46:32.965
because there's always people that are 
traumatized by the horror of war.

46:35.459 --> 46:44.958
But I don't think those fellows are any different 
than the guys in World War II or in Korea or the

46:35.459 --> 46:44.958
Spanish-American War or the Civil War. I mean, 
yeah, war's a nasty thing, but you tend to put those

46:44.978 --> 46:50.169
things behind you. And, you know, the vast 
majority of the guys that went to Vietnam...
