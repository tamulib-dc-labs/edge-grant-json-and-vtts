00:02.005 --> 00:14.935
And meeting people is an asset that you'll have or you can't, or you can get it someplace else, but you can tell the people that go to A&M when you walk in a room.

00:15.843 --> 00:32.863
And in our day, we had to stand up to meet everybody and you'll still see people, you'll know where they went and about what class years they were when they stand up to meet somebody or whether they were in the Corps or not primarily because we had to do that and people say, you don't have to stand up.

00:32.883 --> 00:37.949
Well, I do have to stand up because that's the way I was taught to meet people, you know.

00:39.511 --> 00:43.496
So it's just a, you learn everything about life.

00:43.596 --> 00:44.517
I had a friend,

00:45.998 --> 00:51.806
that was head of the highway department that told me that his degree only got him the job with the highway department.

00:51.866 --> 00:58.135
What he learned at A&M is what got him the head job at the highway department.

00:58.676 --> 01:00.158
Raymond Stotcher was his name.

01:03.823 --> 01:11.854
What is it that creates this strong feeling about the school, this Aggie spirit?

01:12.509 --> 01:13.431
What creates that?

01:13.451 --> 01:14.252
I'm going to tell you.

01:14.492 --> 01:17.057
I don't know what creates it, but I can tell you what it is.

01:18.620 --> 01:19.762
We never graduate.

01:19.822 --> 01:22.767
Think about that.

01:24.991 --> 01:26.734
We're still part of this deal.

01:27.455 --> 01:30.841
We're still part of this school, and we never graduate.

01:31.763 --> 01:32.724
Are there some event?

01:32.744 --> 01:33.866
We get a diploma.

01:33.886 --> 01:37.673
We do a lot of things, and we go to work, but we never graduate.

01:38.142 --> 01:43.571
Are there some events that are very important in creating these strong feelings?

01:43.671 --> 01:44.352
Well, sure.

01:44.452 --> 01:45.294
What are they?

01:45.314 --> 01:58.555
The muster is one, of course, and the silver taps is one, of course, and the camaraderie with your roommate, the camaraderie with the different areas that you spend time in.

01:58.595 --> 02:04.825
The people today, they're in Escona, so to speak, which we didn't have, which is fine.

02:05.041 --> 02:08.385
the people that work in that to get these other kids here.

02:08.806 --> 02:12.390
There's got to be a camaraderie there that binds them to the school.

02:12.911 --> 02:15.014
It's being on the student senate.

02:16.235 --> 02:34.238
You know, the leadership they learn and the politics and so forth and just the whole nine yards because we, the student body pretty well governs themselves around here.

02:34.319 --> 02:44.951
You do things or you get places because of your peers, not because the administration or because somebody likes you or because you have money or because you don't have money.

02:46.113 --> 02:56.385
It may have changed a little bit when they brought in this Greek thing and all of that, but still, I think even they have some loyalty back to the school.

02:56.405 --> 03:03.313
But if you were a consultant to Texas A&M's leadership today,

03:04.762 --> 03:07.486
about what A&M should or should not do in the future.

03:07.626 --> 03:12.272
What advice would you give them?

03:12.292 --> 03:14.094
About their leadership today?

03:14.114 --> 03:14.655
Well, no.

03:14.715 --> 03:19.882
You're advising the key decision makers about what A&M should or should not do in the future.

03:20.202 --> 03:26.230
What would you tell them to keep doing or not do?

03:33.331 --> 03:44.603
Well, they, I think I would have to tell them they need to keep, I'll say the core because of the leadership qualities.

03:45.885 --> 03:49.689
But you get leadership qualities in other areas of this place also.

03:50.150 --> 03:57.718
As I just pointed out, the students sent it to lead that to be the president of the student body or a class officer or something.

03:58.627 --> 04:06.360
But those things they need to maintain, and they need to maintain the spirit.

04:08.624 --> 04:09.706
I don't know how you do that.

04:10.066 --> 04:21.225
My friend says the spirit of Texas A&M was not born in English 103, but on Kyle Field, you know.

04:27.010 --> 04:29.954
So I don't know, that's, I could probably think of some others.

04:30.235 --> 04:37.726
Would you have any thoughts about how large the student body be or how selective admissions ought to be or?

04:38.507 --> 04:39.789
Well, I'll tell you what I think.

04:40.070 --> 04:43.455
I think that the student body is probably large enough right now.

04:44.977 --> 04:49.924
But I also think that we're getting away from the good old solid C student.

04:52.048 --> 04:54.992
And this school was built on the solid C student.

04:56.086 --> 05:00.012
because probably 90% of the C students are working A and B students.

05:01.895 --> 05:22.027
If you really got out and looked at those who own their own companies now, if you went back and checked their record, there may be one or two that were just, but if we were trying to, how would we identify those students with that potential?

05:22.127 --> 05:23.730
How could we identify them?

05:27.878 --> 05:28.499
I don't know that.

05:28.519 --> 05:29.920
I don't have an answer to that, by the way.

05:29.940 --> 05:31.101
Well, I don't either really.

05:31.382 --> 05:46.238
It's just, well, the ones that I would say, well, you'd have to have just average SATs and average this and average that, you know.

05:48.120 --> 05:50.062
They can make it, I think, if they come up here.

05:50.402 --> 05:55.708
But are there any academic areas that we ought to start or to stop?

05:55.992 --> 05:57.594
Well, don't get me off on that.

05:57.654 --> 06:02.139
I'm not into liberal arts, I'll tell you that, so, and I don't want to hurt your feelings.

06:03.961 --> 06:11.190
The thing that gets, I think we're getting away from the land-grant school, and I think we're getting away from what we were put here for.

06:12.211 --> 06:17.417
There's other schools around the country that have great, outstanding music, liberal arts.

06:17.477 --> 06:18.598
They've been in a hundred years.

06:19.880 --> 06:25.206
And just to put us in it so we can be someplace, which we already are, if you ask anybody in,

06:26.182 --> 06:40.461
Arabia and oil companies over there, the Aggies that are running the place, the Aggies that are running the Panama Canal, I think the head man and seven out of the twenty that run it are A&M graduates.

06:40.481 --> 06:46.068
You know, it's, we're all over the world already in a world-class university, you know.

06:46.108 --> 06:51.295
See, I tell people, if we would start in the fine arts, in music and the fine arts now,

06:51.595 --> 06:56.000
in 30 years we could be as good as North Texas was 30 years ago.

06:56.060 --> 06:58.463
I believe that.

07:01.566 --> 07:04.930
You know, but so that's just, and that's just a pet peeve.

07:05.571 --> 07:07.733
I'm sure they know what they're doing.

07:07.833 --> 07:09.395
I'm not into that, so.

07:09.415 --> 07:14.481
If you, if someone walked up to you and gave you a check for a million dollars,

07:14.461 --> 07:21.673
But you had, one of the commitments you had to make was to pass that money on to A&M.

07:21.693 --> 07:28.706
If you could make a major gift, personal gift to A&M, for what purpose, for what use would you want that money?

07:30.569 --> 07:36.519
Well, it would be, I would say at least half of it would probably go to the Corps for Corps scholarships.

07:37.561 --> 07:39.945
And then,

07:41.731 --> 07:43.312
Probably into engineering or.

07:43.773 --> 07:45.274
How do you select the recipients?

07:51.820 --> 07:53.602
If you were making the choices.

07:53.962 --> 07:54.102
Oh.

07:58.126 --> 08:00.188
Well, on the core scholarships.

08:00.208 --> 08:00.628
Either one.

08:00.908 --> 08:01.309
Either one.

08:05.272 --> 08:07.394
Is it just by luck?

08:07.774 --> 08:08.855
Put a name out of the hand?

08:09.216 --> 08:09.756
It could be.

08:09.936 --> 08:11.738
No.

08:13.675 --> 08:26.215
We'd have to take some high school grades, of course, but also on family ties, I guess, to the school or people that want to come.

08:30.341 --> 08:33.025
We really need to find two people that really want to come here.

08:36.451 --> 08:39.075
See, I've often said,

08:40.743 --> 08:54.360
To what former students, faculty, advisors, to what people from your A&M student years do you feel deep feelings of gratitude?

08:57.884 --> 09:03.211
Who in those years helped you in whatever way?

09:10.140 --> 09:10.480
Hmm.

09:12.687 --> 09:17.513
Were there some events where you now realize that was a key event while you were a student?

09:23.321 --> 09:26.104
Well, Dr. Groneman was very important to me.

09:27.887 --> 09:38.881
And people in my department there, Dr. Groneman and Dr. Boone, were very important too.

09:39.101 --> 09:40.703
That's Jim Boone.

09:41.223 --> 09:42.404
James.

09:42.665 --> 09:43.406
James, yeah.

09:43.426 --> 09:43.686
James.

09:43.866 --> 09:44.207
Yeah.

09:44.707 --> 09:58.284
And also Dr. The Big Man, big guy in industrial technology.

09:58.364 --> 09:59.366
What was his name?

10:04.392 --> 10:05.013
We'll get it later.

10:05.694 --> 10:09.238
Anyway, he helped me a lot and

10:11.969 --> 10:17.823
Who else?

10:19.386 --> 10:20.068
Dean Benson.

10:22.493 --> 10:29.269
I thought the world and all of him, and he was just a good person that I knew.

10:30.734 --> 10:32.736
Did you have any classes with him by chance?

10:33.477 --> 10:34.699
No, I didn't.

10:34.719 --> 10:36.982
I just... Did you have any with Graneman?

10:38.063 --> 10:38.864
Yes.

10:38.884 --> 10:40.426
What was he like as a teacher?

10:41.007 --> 10:41.667
He was okay.

10:41.687 --> 10:47.775
He was a little loose, you know, but he was okay.

10:48.376 --> 10:48.976
He was good.

10:50.398 --> 10:50.939
He taught us.

10:50.999 --> 10:52.461
We learned what we needed to know.

10:52.481 --> 10:54.183
Let's see, you mentioned McGuire earlier.

10:54.403 --> 10:54.763
Was he?

10:54.783 --> 10:55.504
Dean McGuire.

10:55.604 --> 11:00.150
He's the guy that let me in and that helped me through the first...

11:01.244 --> 11:05.690
semester or two.

11:09.535 --> 11:14.161
But he really, really did me good.

11:14.582 --> 11:24.495
Were there some buddies that were important in helping you become what you are?

11:28.721 --> 11:30.103
Well, Warris and

11:31.501 --> 11:35.885
I'm having a mental blank now, it's getting too late.

11:36.726 --> 11:37.066
Herbie.

11:37.607 --> 11:38.568
Oh.

11:38.588 --> 11:40.690
That's after you, after I got out.

11:40.710 --> 11:41.350
Yeah, yeah.

11:41.370 --> 11:47.877
But they helped me considerably and who else?

11:58.547 --> 12:01.069
There were some, well.

12:06.938 --> 12:08.520
Well, that's about all.

12:08.981 --> 12:09.281
All right.

12:09.301 --> 12:10.903
Now, I've only got one more question.

12:10.963 --> 12:16.531
Have we left anything out that you might have thought of that we were going to talk about?

12:16.551 --> 12:17.131
I don't think so.

12:17.412 --> 12:17.732
All right.

12:18.093 --> 12:23.740
Then my last question is, what feelings do you carry in your heart about Texas A&M today?

12:31.230 --> 12:33.393
Well, great feelings.

12:34.354 --> 12:36.557
Just outstanding feelings.

12:38.022 --> 12:41.588
worked here, retired here, still give money.

12:42.570 --> 12:44.032
Why?

12:44.052 --> 12:44.994
Why do you feel that way?

12:45.675 --> 12:45.935
Why?

12:47.117 --> 12:48.800
Just because I haven't graduated.

12:51.925 --> 12:53.208
I'm still a part of this deal.

12:53.228 --> 12:56.453
I put a lot of life into this place.

12:58.711 --> 13:11.168
During my five years with the former students taking care of all the A&M clubs, I had a chance to meet all the deans, most of the professors, taking them to club meetings.

13:12.609 --> 13:22.603
We started, as you recall, in 70, 71, the counselors program.

13:23.864 --> 13:28.110
Well, I was in charge of all of that, so I set up all those meetings with the alumni

13:28.630 --> 13:32.616
Took the airplanes full of the deans and the administration.

13:36.301 --> 13:44.894
So I've had a great part in the structure and the former students and the 12th Man Foundation.

13:44.934 --> 13:52.225
They were raising $250,075 when I went there and $2 million when I left.

13:53.470 --> 13:58.540
So I put a lot of work into this place and I want it to progress.

13:58.560 --> 14:07.497
I want it to get better and I hate it when people don't do good.
