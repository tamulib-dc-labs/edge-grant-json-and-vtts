WEBVTT

00:02.461 --> 00:05.405
Testing, testing, Friday, Friday. Testing, 
testing.

00:11.695 --> 00:15.601
When we quit last Friday, we had you finish your 
freshman year. What did you do that summer after

00:16.482 --> 00:19.006
your freshman year? Well, as I indicated earlier, 
I had this agreement with my parents who couldn't

00:19.406 --> 00:29.922
support me, but they offered to pay me, I think, 
$600 room and board to work on the farm that summer.

00:29.942 --> 00:31.945
So that's what I did, and I worked pretty hard. One 
of the interesting experiences that was, the work

00:32.279 --> 00:43.540
was pretty hard and pretty hot in the summer, but we 
did have a good tradition of about a two hour break

00:32.279 --> 00:43.540
at midday to get away from the heat. Started early, 
had dinner, and then took a nice lap and worked till

00:43.580 --> 00:50.473
late, you know, dark at night. made it very 
difficult when you came back to September and had a

00:51.044 --> 00:56.210
one o'clock class to stay awake. Your work day on 
the farm began at what time? Daylight? Yeah,

01:00.555 --> 01:01.896
daylight. I guess that was before daylight 
saving. They used daylight saving time during the

01:05.080 --> 01:08.164
war, but they dropped it after the war. So it was 
basically, we had a very heavy routine. We had

01:12.889 --> 01:18.115
usually up around six, and at that time my sister 
had already left so there were only three of us and

01:18.584 --> 01:48.000
it'd be an hour hour and a half of doing the chores 
because we had cows about 20 cows to milk chickens

01:18.584 --> 01:48.000
to feed hogs to feed sheep everything else my 
mother usually left about 20 minutes before and

01:18.584 --> 01:48.000
after about an hour and a half we ate breakfast and 
that's why i'm still a big breakfast eater because

01:18.584 --> 01:48.000
you were really ready to eat and then you went out 
and do the fields and then what had to be done in the

01:18.584 --> 01:48.000
fields worked till noon had a pretty good meal at 
noon and in the summertime you rest at during the

01:49.010 --> 01:55.718
period, during the heat of the day, and then went 
back out around 2 or 2.30 and worked till dark,

01:49.010 --> 01:55.718
which was 7, 8 o'clock. So you were grateful for the 
opportunity to come back to school. I've often

02:00.945 --> 02:08.094
heard many Aggies say that many Baptist ministers 
got their call in the middle of a patch in August.

02:09.035 --> 02:12.619
All right, you came back as a sophomore and lived 
where? Well, the old company that I had been in had

02:12.760 --> 02:18.747
been broken up and had been assigned to D 
Artillery. I think just arbitrarily. I don't know

02:20.667 --> 02:21.789
that I had a choice. I don't remember having a 
choice. But that was the year, this was 46, when the

02:23.631 --> 02:30.860
things really bulged, because that's when the 
veterans really came back in. And there was a huge

02:30.880 --> 02:33.062
housing shortage. And that's when they went to 
three to a room. And if you're familiar with the

02:35.946 --> 02:43.315
dormitories over in the new dorm area, the core 
area, those rooms are barely big enough for two.

02:43.395 --> 02:49.442
And they actually put a triple, another bunk on top 
of the two bunks to save a little space. There

02:49.777 --> 02:52.821
really wasn't much space for a table or anybody 
else. So it was a very difficult circumstance. And

02:55.204 --> 02:58.348
of course, my own situation was working in the 
library. I still did most of my studying at the

02:58.468 --> 03:04.596
library and stayed in the room just the minimum 
period that I had. And also, as I said, probably

03:04.636 --> 03:10.224
escaped some of the activities that I didn't want 
to participate in. How did three roommates decide

03:10.244 --> 03:15.210
who slept on the top and who on the bottom? Some of it 
was tar plays, I guess, and some of it was, I think

03:17.063 --> 03:22.830
most of the time it was by flipping coins or 
something like that. And we took turns. I think

03:24.112 --> 03:27.396
that's what we usually, I mean, we often took 
turns, I think. And some just had preferences for

03:27.977 --> 03:30.300
one thing or the other.

03:33.724 --> 03:37.509
Was there an effort made to have three study tables 
in that crowd? I think they managed to put a third

03:37.589 --> 03:42.035
one in there in front of the window or something 
like that. And they had only two closets, which we

03:42.175 --> 03:46.581
were even starting off with, but not even too large 
for one person but it was it was not very easy to

03:46.662 --> 04:13.260
operate in and the other of course the other 
problem as i indicated with all these veterans

03:46.662 --> 04:13.260
coming back even those who had not performed too 
well academically before they went to the war most

03:46.662 --> 04:13.260
of them had gotten married and gotten the gi bill 
and they were determined to make their mark and

03:46.662 --> 04:13.260
many many who had barely passing averages 
suddenly were straight-a students and it was

03:46.662 --> 04:13.260
pretty

04:16.632 --> 04:23.581
Was the temporary housing for the veterans over 
around the football stadium, was that yet there?

04:23.661 --> 04:25.443
Well, they used the project houses. Okay. They 
used those, but then they built on the north side,

04:26.044 --> 04:37.418
they brought in all those barracks, and that's 
where most of the veterans lived. And there were a

04:37.779 --> 04:43.506
lot of barracks on campus about where the Brocker 
building in that area were used for classrooms. I

04:43.646 --> 04:45.188
remember many classrooms were held in. pretty 
unsatisfactory. I mean, they couldn't be cooled,

04:46.783 --> 05:02.423
well, we didn't have air conditioning, and even 
pretty hard to heat, but there were a lot of, just

04:46.783 --> 05:02.423
one barrack, all temporary buildings, and the 
housing, well, that wasn't even too long ago when

04:46.783 --> 05:02.423
they turned, that served A&M for many, many years 
for barrack student housing. Do you remember

05:03.224 --> 05:10.433
seeing some veterans who were badly injured 
hobbling to class? Uh, not too many. There were

05:12.085 --> 05:21.534
some, and of course they loved to kid the younger 
ones of us that hadn't had all the experiences that

05:12.085 --> 05:21.534
they had and made fun about it and so forth. But they 
also, I think, were good role models because they

05:21.554 --> 05:28.942
studied and they were in the business. And you were 
settled into your major by now? I think so, yeah,

05:32.966 --> 05:34.367
pretty well. I was headed in that direction. I 
guess the two general things that we hadn't

05:38.493 --> 06:05.057
commented on, and I'm not sure when these 
happened, there was a famous revolt, senior

05:38.493 --> 06:05.057
revolt, where the seniors, because of the 
crackdown on hazing, as I recall, and the, the

05:38.493 --> 06:05.057
Oprah's was president at the time, and he cracked 
down on, and the senior commission, who were

05:38.493 --> 06:05.057
commission officers, decided they would push him 
in a corner by offering their resignations, and It

06:05.695 --> 06:07.478
probably happened my freshman year. It could have 
been my sophomore year. But anyway, the seniors

06:08.599 --> 06:29.630
had everybody fall out late one evening, 9, 10 
o'clock, with bearing torches, marched on the

06:08.599 --> 06:29.630
president's home, and they, with a great deal of 
ceremony, they handed him their resignations as

06:08.599 --> 06:29.630
protest to this crackdown on core activities. And 
to their utter surprise, he accepted it. And I

06:32.982 --> 06:37.590
didn't know really what the, I was just marching in 
and marching back. But anyway, that was one of the

06:37.630 --> 06:40.955
interesting things that happened. Also during 
this period, it might have been about my sophomore

06:41.536 --> 06:53.556
year, we had a lot of publicity focused on campus 
that there was a Life magazine came down and did a

06:41.536 --> 06:53.556
story. and did a picture of the entire corps 
assembled in front of the mess hall. I'm in that

06:57.720 --> 06:58.521
picture. I still find myself. Have you ever seen 
that? Yeah. And that was a big activity. Anyway, in

07:03.570 --> 07:14.329
the sophomore year, as I said, that was the year I 
started working in the library full-time and

07:03.570 --> 07:14.329
enjoyed that aspect of it. I may have had been for 
that. I don't know if I could have either paid for my

07:15.631 --> 07:18.396
education because I probably averaged working 
about 30 hours a week mostly in the evening like

07:19.203 --> 07:47.809
when I got to the after I did my apprenticeship 
running the stacks you moved up a little and

07:19.203 --> 07:47.809
finally got to the reserve desk which was the ideal 
place to be because in a three hour period you might

07:19.203 --> 07:47.809
have an actual work of maybe a half an hour or 45 
minutes and then occasionally somebody would

07:19.203 --> 07:47.809
come in but the idea was the books were on reserve 
for two hour use The student could come in, get the

07:48.329 --> 07:51.575
book, and then turn it in. You'd have to shelve it 
and take care of that aspect of it. But it was a

07:54.580 --> 07:55.822
wonderful place to study. It was quiet, and the 
resources were handy and all that. Now, the

07:59.508 --> 08:03.675
library was a quiet place to escape from hazing, 
wasn't it? Well, yeah, for a lot of people. That's

08:05.440 --> 08:06.061
what I mean. But it was a wonderful place, and 
especially with three to a room. It was a wonderful

08:08.726 --> 08:10.149
refuge. I probably would have gone there anyway if 
I could have. But see, the core of regulations was

08:13.575 --> 08:19.386
that unless you had a job, you were expected to be in 
your room. Oh. Even as a sophomore. Now, you didn't

08:21.670 --> 08:28.022
have the, you weren't tied down where you had to 
stick at your desk. But you had to stay in your room,

08:28.576 --> 08:31.144
too. I mean, you could move around and you could 
visit with colleagues and so forth. But they were

08:34.494 --> 08:35.939
also enforcers. They'd walk up and down the hall 
periodically to make sure of the freshmen. The

08:40.252 --> 08:41.877
freshmen always had to keep their door open. But 
could you claim that you were in the library doing

08:42.245 --> 08:45.450
homework? Yes, well, yes, occasionally. But then 
you could only do it. But if you worked, I mean, you

08:47.833 --> 08:49.876
put that on your schedule. You placed your 
schedule on your door so the upperclassmen would

08:50.337 --> 08:55.724
know how to account for you. And if there was a 
vacant period, you'd have to account for it. And it

09:00.771 --> 09:06.860
was nice to feel at work and so forth, where you 
could escape some of that activity. And the

09:06.880 --> 09:08.843
librarian at this point was whom? I can't remember 
for sure. If you name the names, I might recognize

09:10.456 --> 09:12.078
them. I don't remember. He was a former English 
professor. Tommy Mayo? Mayo. Oh, he still was?

09:17.142 --> 09:17.462
Okay. Maybe. Because he was the director for a 
long, long time. But I had very little contact at my

09:21.566 --> 09:23.528
level with him. Describe the environment of the 
library at that time. Well, it was basically the

09:27.311 --> 09:30.674
Cushing part, as you know. I'm not even sure. I 
can't even remember as much where the downstairs

09:32.696 --> 09:38.982
were used, where those exhibition rooms are now. 
The main center was the second floor, where they

09:39.147 --> 09:47.735
had on the west side, as it still is there, this huge 
long reading room. That's where the reserve desk

09:48.075 --> 09:51.498
was located at the entrance. And then, on the east 
side, they had the circulation desk, where the

09:51.518 --> 10:03.209
students ran and accepted the request for books 
and ran the hand stacks and brought them back to

09:51.518 --> 10:03.209
whoever requested them. Was there ever any 
hijink, any pranks in the library? Not that I'm

10:08.138 --> 10:09.426
aware of. I'm not aware of any. Speaking of pranks, 
of course, you've heard this before. Sometimes

10:14.635 --> 10:22.245
with the tacit blessing I guess of the juniors and 
seniors, some sophomores really got out of line. I

10:22.365 --> 10:26.911
mean they were the enforcers in terms of the 
paddling and the hazing and so forth. Of course it

10:26.931 --> 10:38.567
was presumed that the juniors and seniors put them 
up to it to some extent, but sometimes a little

10:26.931 --> 10:38.567
sometimes some sophomores got a little too 
enthusiastic and the the way for the freshmen to

10:39.374 --> 10:43.305
strike back was roundouts. You knew that. They'd 
get a wastebasket full of water, and usually it was

10:44.307 --> 10:52.449
water, but if he was really obnoxious, sometimes 
it was treated water. There were some human some

10:53.735 --> 10:56.438
human fluid. And it often really helped. It cooled 
off the ardor in terms of some of the—another

10:58.100 --> 11:05.829
practice—this was mostly done on piers. You'd 
short-sheet people, if you've heard of that. That

11:09.454 --> 11:10.936
was some of the activities. I told you about hazing 
the students always trying to play pranks on the

11:11.116 --> 11:22.189
campus cops, the KKs as we called them, wherever we 
could, because they were regarded as not too

11:22.996 --> 11:27.241
intellectually swift, and that was some of the 
side activities. Now, was the, did y'all call it

11:27.842 --> 11:30.705
the quack shack then? Yeah. Describe it. Well, I 
had a very, I guess it was, no, it was later on, it was

11:35.972 --> 11:42.520
generally lowly regarded by the students. I mean, 
you went there as a last resort. In fact, I could

11:44.522 --> 11:45.643
tell you a story. I almost died there myself later 
on. I might as well have entered. I think I was

11:49.568 --> 11:51.130
further along. but I got a very bad strep 
infection, it might have been my junior year, and

11:52.139 --> 12:16.932
antibiotics had just become available, but they 
were treating me here, they had only one aged

11:52.139 --> 12:16.932
doctor as I remember, and maybe a nurse or two, and 
that was it, but they had a hospital, a little,

11:52.139 --> 12:16.932
several beds, and I was in there, and which we've 
discovered since then that I I'm allergic to

12:18.413 --> 12:21.477
sulfa, but that's what they were treating me with, 
sulfa. Same here. Instead of penicillin, I mean,

12:22.218 --> 12:36.058
they didn't... About that time there was a 
colleague of mine from my same community who was

12:22.218 --> 12:36.058
one class ahead of me, who we started riding, he had 
a car and I didn't, sometimes that was my ticket to

12:22.218 --> 12:36.058
get home. Anyway, he was concerned about me and 
even though we didn't live in the same dorm or

12:36.959 --> 12:43.729
anything, he looked after me and he was raving with 
these people you've got to do something because at

12:45.312 --> 13:12.754
that time i was not even conscious and he took it on 
himself to take me out of there and took me home to

12:45.312 --> 13:12.754
the family doctor who gave me penicillin and two 
days later i was back in school i mean you know the

12:45.312 --> 13:12.754
penicillin was really marvellous but i think the 
uh i guess the budget was such they had it was an

12:45.312 --> 13:12.754
elderly gentleman who was here and as i said it was 
generally a place to be avoided I guess if you were

13:13.240 --> 13:15.042
an accident, you were carried there. And I guess 
anything more serious was taken to the local

13:15.062 --> 13:19.328
hospital or something like this. Now, since you, 
as a sophomore, were not a hazer, did your buddies,

13:20.109 --> 13:29.522
did your classmates look down on you? Did they 
tease you about it? No, no particular problem.

13:33.026 --> 13:39.535
There were always enough that were eager enough 
to, I guess it was their revenge for what they had

13:33.026 --> 13:39.535
done. experience as freshman, but I didn't see it 
as that way. I thought, you know, sometimes the

13:42.356 --> 13:57.812
cycle has to be broken, but no, I don't think so, and 
as I said, I kept, you know, I was more interested in

13:42.356 --> 13:57.812
academics, I have to indicate, and I tried to keep 
as low a profile as possible in terms of the core

13:42.356 --> 13:57.812
activities. I didn't have anything against them, 
but I felt the primary purpose of coming here was an

13:57.872 --> 14:08.644
education, and I felt some of that wasn't 
contributing to the education. Another thing I

14:12.511 --> 14:24.082
guess I could comment on was, and you've probably 
heard this too, and I had visited, because I park in

14:12.511 --> 14:24.082
that particular area, with some of the bonfire 
leaders in the last several years.

14:27.105 --> 14:32.509
If they had continued the tradition as we had it 
when we were here, there wouldn't have been a

14:27.105 --> 14:32.509
problem as far as I see it. The tradition then was 
you had a good big bonfire, but you did no work on it.

14:37.818 --> 15:03.437
absolutely none until the second last game which 
was usually at that time there was a flat pattern

14:37.818 --> 15:03.437
with TCU which was about a weekend a week it was 
about 10 11 days before the TU game and everybody

14:37.818 --> 15:03.437
went out and did the work then but we built one layer 
which you know couldn't fall I mean just one cone

14:37.818 --> 15:03.437
layer made a pretty good fire and that was it we were 
not allowed to work on the other And the other,

15:03.721 --> 15:28.550
there were some other traditions, as you're 
probably aware, when we played SMU, all the

15:03.721 --> 15:28.550
freshmen had to wear spurs, made out of coat 
hangers with bottle caps so they'd, you know, spur

15:03.721 --> 15:28.550
the ponies and that type of thing, and there were 
some other traditions like that, that every time,

15:03.721 --> 15:28.550
you only look forward to the next game, you never 
look beyond the second, I mean, beyond the next

15:03.721 --> 15:28.550
game, and went on from there. But I often say if 
they'd have kept with it, didn't get competitive

15:31.801 --> 16:00.053
in seeing how high they could get and I've been 
observing this the last several years that you

15:31.801 --> 16:00.053
know this is an accident waiting to happen and I've 
told told several people I have a good engineering

15:31.801 --> 16:00.053
friend I play tennis with who is a structural 
engineer and he's he has had filed numerous

15:31.801 --> 16:00.053
reports pointing out that you know this was an 
accident waiting to happen but anyway I think they

15:31.801 --> 16:00.053
ought to go back to if they want to have a bonfire 
have a modest one and it still makes a pretty good

15:31.801 --> 16:00.053
fire. And your work on the bonfire was where? Were 
you a cutter, a hauler, or? Well, it really, it was

16:07.593 --> 16:13.119
more of a scrounging operation. I mean, we picked 
up, there was trash in there, too. I mean, there

16:15.482 --> 16:18.986
were some logs, but I mean, I think it started out 
with just trash. Oh, before the war, I know. Yeah,

16:20.868 --> 16:28.838
and then later on, they started making a mixture of 
it, but we were told, I mean, that was one of the

16:20.868 --> 16:28.838
hazing, if you see a toothpick, pick it up. It's 
something to put on the bonfire, and so people just

16:28.858 --> 16:35.305
kept gathering, and I guess the cutting started 
about that time, But we had no machinery, cranes

16:35.285 --> 16:39.874
and all of that stuff. We did everything 
ourselves. And it was pretty much a big effort

16:42.238 --> 16:46.065
right at that time. Of course, usually it was rainy 
and sloppy and everything. Now, how did you carry

16:48.550 --> 16:51.496
it to the bonfire site? On shoulders. I mean, a gang 
of 10 or 12 people, there was a big lock, and you'd

16:52.750 --> 17:00.499
push it up manually. I mean, there was no machinery 
whatsoever. All right, before the war, I've had

17:02.181 --> 17:10.832
some people tell me that they borrowed from the 
railroad station those little carts. Yeah, I

17:10.952 --> 17:12.574
think that might have been true. Yeah, they might 
have used some of those. And it was in front of the

17:13.735 --> 17:15.417
MSC. In the drill, on the drill field? It started 
out, yeah, it was in the, yeah, that's where it was.

17:21.656 --> 17:24.140
I can't remember when it was, it might have been 
while I was here. They changed it to the other drill

17:24.240 --> 17:27.564
field over here behind Duncan. But starting out it 
was on the parade ground in front of the MSC, yeah.

17:33.112 --> 17:40.122
Let's see, were you, didn't, did Eisenhower come 
to visit during your student days as a general? I

17:41.722 --> 17:42.463
can't remember. I would have remembered, I think, 
if you had. I was trying to remember when. I don't

17:46.028 --> 17:48.851
know what the year was. Let's see. Academically, 
who became your counselor, advisor? Who did you

17:56.101 --> 17:58.524
turn to for advice? What to take? Well, I had this 
earlier advisor in agricultural engineering as I

18:02.789 --> 18:11.020
got to, I guess, going more to animal science. I 
never really had one. I of course made an

18:13.632 --> 18:28.526
acquaintance with the department head and became 
a lifelong friend, Dr. Miller, who was head

18:13.632 --> 18:28.526
department head, and there were other people, 
O.D. Butler,

18:28.586 --> 18:38.155
Bill Warren, who's back here, who was head of the 
department at Auburn, I guess they moved back

18:28.586 --> 18:38.155
here. All right, who, as you look back on it, what 
were the factors that led you toward your major? I

18:46.902 --> 19:04.868
guess basically my 4-H experience because I had, I 
had sheet projects and a lot of hard projects and I

18:46.902 --> 19:04.868
was just particularly interested in that field 
and I guess at that time, well I guess I was pretty

18:46.902 --> 19:04.868
well aiming toward becoming a county agent or 
preparing myself to come on and The animal aspects

19:05.185 --> 19:09.070
of a county agent's work are pretty important. I 
mean, you can go either ironic or—if you go animal,

19:09.090 --> 19:17.582
you're a little weak in the other, but you have to 
pick it—you still get a balanced course. Who were

19:18.263 --> 19:32.762
the key faculty members and or courses that shaped 
your— Well, I don't know if it shaped it, but I

19:18.263 --> 19:32.762
certainly can recall some for one extreme or the 
other. And I guess I would have to say the best

19:33.316 --> 19:42.684
single professor that I ever encountered was Tom 
Harrington in chemistry, freshman chemistry. I

19:42.704 --> 19:45.827
took that as the second year here, because I told 
you we had to switch. We took the practical

19:45.927 --> 19:47.148
courses. And I was told that the conventional 
wisdom of Aggies was that chemistry, there were

19:47.809 --> 20:02.682
records of people taking it five, six times or 
finally going to a junior college or somewhere and

19:47.809 --> 20:02.682
getting it transferred. and it was a very tough 
course, and I was told that I was hopelessly going

20:03.488 --> 20:13.908
to be lost because I never had high school 
chemistry. I took high school physics. For some

20:15.571 --> 20:21.863
reason, because of the switch from a rural school 
to another, I couldn't get it in, and they said, you

20:15.571 --> 20:21.863
know, you're going to die in this thing. Well, I 
really didn't want to take it again. And so I really

20:25.021 --> 20:45.689
studied hard, and then later on I visited with Dr. 
Harrington about it, and he said, you were better

20:25.021 --> 20:45.689
off the way you were than the ones who had it in high 
school, because they thought they had it made, and

20:25.021 --> 20:45.689
after about four weeks, they were in new 
territory, and they hadn't really learned to

20:25.021 --> 20:45.689
study it. But I made good grades in chemistry, but a 
part of it was because I really worked at it, And Tom

20:51.852 --> 20:54.214
Harrington was just a wonderful lecturer. What 
made him a wonderful lecturer? He had a dynamic

20:57.557 --> 20:59.539
voice. He was enthusiastic. He, you know, kept 
your interest. I remember, you know, I guess it's

21:06.144 --> 21:11.749
still that way, chemistry lecture room, you're 
familiar with it. I guess it holds, what, 250, 300

21:11.769 --> 21:13.811
people? Yeah. Very easy to go to sleep in there, 
huh? And I guess sometimes, but it was hard to sleep

21:16.553 --> 21:20.897
with him because he was such a dynamic professor. 
But I remember one time he filled a balloon with

21:21.350 --> 21:41.007
some, had all these gas outlets on the laboratory, 
filled the balloon one time and raised it up and

21:21.350 --> 21:41.007
then put a Bunsen burner up to it and it popped so 
loud the dust came out of the cracks of the building

21:21.350 --> 21:41.007
and that kept a lot of people from going to sleep 
from that because they almost had heart attacks

21:21.350 --> 21:41.007
when that went on. But he was a wonderful 
professor. Did he have any key attributes in terms

21:42.967 --> 21:51.600
of you must do this or that or you may not do? No, I 
mean... What if you went to sleep? Did he wake you

21:55.687 --> 21:56.508
up? Well, I don't, it was, as I said, pretty hard to 
go to sleep under him because he was such a good

21:56.909 --> 22:09.328
lecturer, and of course you better take good notes 
because the tests were, you know, pretty much all

21:56.909 --> 22:09.328
the material presented in the lecture, but I 
actually enjoyed it. Did he have a student

22:11.734 --> 22:13.735
nickname? Did the students give him a nickname? 
Not that I remember. I've often thought how almost

22:17.579 --> 22:21.702
everybody else had a nickname, but I've never 
heard one for him. No, I can't remember. And as

22:23.344 --> 22:27.828
unlike anybody else. There was not a lot of 
entertainment here on the campus. We had movies on

22:31.871 --> 22:35.635
Saturday night for 25 cents in Guyon Hall. I guess 
there was a campus theater, but I think they

22:35.875 --> 22:39.298
charged more. and couldn't afford it, but the 
students were always looking for some

22:39.869 --> 23:06.217
entertainment, and professors were fair game in 
terms of the observation, and this is, I know his

22:39.869 --> 23:06.217
name, but I don't want to mention it, but there was a 
stereotypical math, absent-minded math

22:39.869 --> 23:06.217
professor who lived in one of the houses here on the 
campus, but he was single, he didn't have a family,

22:39.869 --> 23:06.217
and he always rode his bicycle. Have you heard this 
story? rode his bicycle to classes back and forth.

23:11.548 --> 23:19.680
And he had, the students always, I mean not always, 
but there was usually a group gathered to see this

23:11.548 --> 23:19.680
daily procedure. He'd come back home, the garage 
didn't have a door where the car comes in. He didn't

23:24.808 --> 23:26.310
have a car, he just had a bike. The door was off, it 
was open to the street, but there was a little side

23:27.271 --> 23:33.180
door, like a regular house door, that he came up to, 
carefully unlocked, opened the door, pushed the

23:33.818 --> 23:39.444
bike in, closed the door, and locked it. You could 
see all of this open. And I don't know if he just did

23:41.307 --> 23:45.912
it to entertain the students or if he was really 
that out of it. They had another story about him

23:46.492 --> 23:55.062
that one time he accidentally bumped into a 
student, ran into a student biking. And after the

23:56.043 --> 24:01.309
student assured himself nobody was hurt, the 
professor asked him, he said, do you remember

23:56.043 --> 24:01.309
which way I was going? Because if I was going that 
way, I was coming from home. But those kind of

24:05.206 --> 24:08.129
things, as I said, we were desperate for 
entertainment. What did you and your buddies do

24:09.611 --> 24:12.314
for fun? Say, on a weekend or... I always worked. I 
mean, every weekend, unless there was a football

24:18.301 --> 24:22.686
game, I still, you had to go to a football game. As a 
corps member, you had to go to conference games.

24:25.870 --> 24:28.753
And, of course, when the game was here, you had to 
participate. And that was, I guess, about the main

24:29.594 --> 24:31.256
thing. Very rarely did I go to the movies with 
friends. Occasionally, I mean, there was some

24:35.750 --> 24:43.118
intramural, they were very strong on intramural 
activities, which was probably good. One

24:44.479 --> 24:57.973
of the big, big activities after a big rain, there 
was always mud football, you know, where you

24:44.479 --> 24:57.973
tackle and you could follow the slash and you 
somewhat needed a shower after that. The other

24:58.554 --> 25:05.301
thing that was, I guess, shocking for me, 
particularly in my freshman year, was the In

25:07.424 --> 25:17.281
freshman athletics, they have very high 
requirements, and even though I worked hard on the

25:07.424 --> 25:17.281
farm, I didn't run a lot. They had the expectation 
when you came here to pass first semester of PE, you

25:17.301 --> 25:27.058
had, they had a track over on the other side, they 
called it the Miles and Seven. You had to run that in

25:27.559 --> 25:32.487
a certain prescribed time, and if you're not in 
shape, you know, that takes a while, and they had

25:32.753 --> 25:38.640
Putnam, do you remember the name? Is that the name? 
Yeah. Anyway, he would start us off and then, you

25:43.105 --> 26:01.866
know, pass us all up and be there to clock us in, but I 
think the rule was you had to make it under, I'm not

25:43.105 --> 26:01.866
sure of this, under thirteen minutes to get an A or 
B, and between thirteen and fifteen you'd get a C or

25:43.105 --> 26:01.866
D depending on how you did on everything else, but 
that was a huge requirement for people and luckily

26:02.217 --> 26:25.120
I had heard about it and I started on the farm 
working up to getting in shape and they had you know

26:02.217 --> 26:25.120
so many push-ups chin-ups and all I guess it was 
from the military they were you know the basic

26:02.217 --> 26:25.120
physical standards that they kept but they were 
fairly rugged but there was a lot of uh if uh

26:02.217 --> 26:25.120
activity I said there were intramurals. The Corps 
always, after say the period of between five and

26:27.830 --> 26:37.080
six in the evening, there were usually some 
intramural activity that you were expected to

26:27.830 --> 26:37.080
participate in. But on a Saturday night when there 
wasn't anything scheduled, you and your buddies

26:37.100 --> 26:43.126
didn't go to the clay pits or? No, I never did. I 
mean, I'm sure the others did and there was, I heard

26:44.167 --> 26:53.217
about Ed's, I never knew where that was, but as I 
said, most of my time was spent working and I guess

26:53.602 --> 27:09.045
later on we did begin to notice the interest in the 
opposite sex and you've heard of these stories

26:53.602 --> 27:09.045
about how it was handled when you had dates. I mean I 
did I think have two or three dates come down on home

27:09.205 --> 27:20.402
games and you knew about evacuating a dormitory 
and you'd have to furnish the sheets and then the

27:20.551 --> 27:27.360
The joke was that you wouldn't wash those sheets 
for about a month because they had this wonderful

27:20.551 --> 27:27.360
smell of perfume and so forth. Yeah, one whole dorm 
was evacuated, and you had to find a place to sleep.

27:32.908 --> 27:35.892
And how did the Aggies treat those young ladies? 
Oh, with great respect, tremendous respect. And

27:39.436 --> 27:41.699
it was a real honor for the ladies to come here. I 
mean, that was a coup as far as their peers were back

27:41.739 --> 27:45.865
home were concerned. And, of course, they were to 
the traditions with TWU, particularly when we

27:49.964 --> 27:52.186
went to Dallas or Fort Worth. They came down in 
mass, and there was some interaction. Of course,

27:55.369 --> 27:59.593
there was that earlier tradition of where you 
wrote your counterpart with the same box number.

28:00.134 --> 28:01.936
Sometimes that led to disaster. Sometimes it led 
to, I guess, enduring relationships, as I heard. I

28:05.639 --> 28:06.841
have heard you have, too. On Sunday morning, did 
you go to worship? Yes, I started to. I really

28:12.466 --> 28:18.212
didn't have much of a religious upbringing in my 
home. I mean, my my mother had been I guess of the

28:20.609 --> 28:46.701
Protestant or Lutheran persuasion my father had 
been Catholic but his father had fallen out with

28:20.609 --> 28:46.701
the church and they really didn't do much but I felt 
it's part of my education and I started I guess with

28:20.609 --> 28:46.701
the Lutheran but then the Presbyterians had the 
better facilities over in the YMCA they used the

28:20.609 --> 28:46.701
and so I fell in and to this day I'm a Presbyterian 
because of that But I went, you know, I went most

28:47.120 --> 28:49.545
Sunday mornings. Did you know Mr. Cashin? Oh, yes. 
Describe him. We don't know how—I don't have much

28:53.292 --> 28:54.935
about him. Well, he was the YMCA. I mean, that was 
it, and he ran that— I guess he was Presbyterian,

29:02.290 --> 29:03.972
too. I guess, I remember the Lutherans had the 
second choice of facilities. They had to meet in a

29:07.475 --> 29:16.303
different room, but they had a regular chapel that 
the Presbyterians used because they were one of

29:07.475 --> 29:16.303
the few churches that didn't have their own 
facility here. What about his, what did he, what

29:16.643 --> 29:21.828
physically, what did he look like and his 
personality? Well, he was, as I best remember him,

29:23.569 --> 29:29.935
he was sort of slightly built. And not too outgoing 
or talkative. I mean, they ran their program over

29:34.355 --> 29:40.501
there, YMCA, and they had other activities, you 
know. It was a refuge. I don't think I ever used it

29:41.362 --> 29:43.624
much as a refuge. They had a barbershop there and a 
few other recreational activities. Did you meet

29:48.850 --> 29:50.532
either of his sons? Well, yes, I knew them very 
well, of course. He served on a bank board with him.

29:55.537 --> 29:56.698
No, but as students? No, no, I didn't. I guess Red 
must have been in school with me, but I think he's a

29:58.513 --> 30:02.417
little younger than I am. And Jim? Jim was even 
younger, I think. No, no, Jim's the older one. Oh,

30:06.001 --> 30:07.262
yeah, Jim was the football player. Yes. And Red was 
not, but he learned how to play. That's right. Jim

30:12.268 --> 30:15.311
was a good football player. What about, was there 
Religious Emphasis Week then? Oh, yes, they had

30:19.356 --> 30:21.218
Religious Emphasis Week. and there was not too 
much separation of church and state in fact I guess

30:21.586 --> 30:42.092
that's one of the things that turned me off with the 
Lutheran program the minister at that time was a

30:21.586 --> 30:42.092
little too I guess I had a spirit of

30:21.586 --> 30:42.092
your religiosity is something you do and don't get 
it from the outside. This particular Lutheran

30:47.029 --> 31:04.063
minister took it on himself, because the churches 
were given the information from registration,

30:47.029 --> 31:04.063
who was Presbyterian, who was Lutheran, 
Catholic, and so forth, and they knew where you

30:47.029 --> 31:04.063
lived, and this Lutheran minister took it on 
himself to knock on doors at 8 o'clock in the

30:47.029 --> 31:04.063
morning in the dorm to remind them. Lutheran 
students to come to church, and I guess I'd put

31:04.583 --> 31:09.127
Lutheran on them, and I resented that. I mean, I 
thought that was a private morning, and you know,

31:09.147 --> 31:26.803
if I wanted to go to church, I would, but it kind of 
turned me off at the time, but I mean, there was a lot

31:09.147 --> 31:26.803
of, and they had the religious emphasis week, they 
had activities right here on the campus of

31:09.147 --> 31:26.803
outstanding ministers or speakers coming in and 
so forth. Were there Sunday night? Oh, Sunday

31:28.685 --> 31:32.008
night activities and Wednesday night, and you 
wouldn't, Nothing else would be scheduled on

31:32.427 --> 31:35.522
Wednesday nights or on Sunday evenings. Was there 
any food served? Oh, yes, and girls were often

31:37.592 --> 31:40.345
there.
