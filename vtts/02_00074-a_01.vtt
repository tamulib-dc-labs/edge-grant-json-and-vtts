00:02.427 --> 00:15.359
This is July 13, sitting in the study of Raul 
Fernandez in San Antonio, and delighted to have

00:02.427 --> 00:15.359
the opportunity to chat with him about his student 
days. I think I mentioned to you the first question

00:16.260 --> 00:23.247
I would ask would be, why did you go to A&M in the 
first place? Why did you go there instead of

00:23.267 --> 00:25.549
somewhere else? And were you, like me, from a 
working class background, and going to college

00:25.929 --> 00:32.215
was a big step? It was a big step, no question. See, 
both my parents were born in Mexico and neither

00:34.134 --> 00:39.039
probably finished grade school. However, they 
instilled in us, you're going to go to college.

00:43.544 --> 00:44.545
You're going to go to college. And I believed that. 
And there was no decision for me to make. I followed

00:49.911 --> 00:51.493
my brothers. And my brother Gus, who was a freshman 
in 49, and then Albert. And Gus passed 53, and then

00:58.680 --> 01:01.223
Albert passed 54. And Albert graduated on the 
night that I graduated from high school. He

01:06.889 --> 01:09.052
graduated from A&M. And so we just switched 
places, and he went back to Laredo, and I went to

01:09.072 --> 01:13.096
College Station. And your class of? 59. 59. And did 
you visit A&M before? I had the occasion to go a few

01:22.146 --> 01:31.716
times, both on a, I already had my mind made up, but 
we got a day to go visit a college or university. And

01:32.185 --> 01:37.213
the three of us from Laredo, we drove up there and 
spent the day at A&M. There was no other

01:38.234 --> 01:39.737
consideration for me. I applied to one 
university, and I was very fortunate to have a $250

01:39.897 --> 01:51.114
scholarship, if I remember correctly, from the 
Laredo A&M Mothers Club. And God bless them for

01:51.134 --> 02:00.268
that, because at that time, it cost $800 to $900 for 
everything for a year. And so that was like a 25%

02:00.755 --> 02:06.520
supplement to what I was about. And so I didn't work 
the first semester. But it took me, I crammed four

02:09.884 --> 02:14.508
into five. And 10 semesters, I worked nine. The 
first one, I didn't have to. I felt like that was OK.

02:21.434 --> 02:25.118
While you're on that subject of work, what were 
your work? At A&M? Where did you work? Well, I had,

02:26.900 --> 02:29.462
most of the time, I worked around the MSC. 
Mid-semester of my freshman year I got a job in what

02:33.391 --> 02:40.482
used to be the MSC reading library down the lower 
level. It was like a reading library and then it

02:40.942 --> 02:46.030
became something else after that. I started there 
and then about towards the end of my freshman year

02:50.570 --> 02:57.077
of the semester, a job opened up making signs in the 
basement. I remember the elevator used to go down

02:57.217 --> 03:03.163
and you'd open the doors and you'd go into there, 
there'd be a cage right in front of you, a lot of work

02:57.217 --> 03:03.163
in that cage. And we had an embossed graphing 
machine there and we made all the signs for the

03:03.883 --> 03:07.927
university. What was your pay, do you remember? 
No, but I worked for Herbie Johns. Mr. Johns was

03:12.472 --> 03:18.518
the, I guess he was the manager of the MSC at the 
time. Gosh, I don't remember. Maybe 35, 40 cents an

03:20.868 --> 03:22.910
hour. Maybe, maybe 50 cents. Now, did you work in 
the MSC nine semesters? Yes, all night. However,

03:28.975 --> 03:33.019
other times I had one other job, and one time I had 
three jobs. What were those others? Being an

03:35.921 --> 03:47.011
engineering major, I got the opportunity to work 
at TTI, Texas Transportation Institute, and we

03:35.921 --> 03:47.011
did testing of cylinders and the kinds of things we 
did in a lab. We learned that, and we'd go over there

03:47.031 --> 03:49.753
and do grunt work and Mike Woodson and Wesley Heald 
and I, we were all running buddies. I think Wesley

03:55.452 --> 04:01.017
is just the new chief engineer for the highway 
department, if you heard his name bad around. So we

04:01.037 --> 04:04.280
would work at that. My brother Gus worked with me 
three years in making signs, because right after I

04:04.540 --> 04:16.671
got there, the brother person was there left, and 
so I got Gus to come in there, and so we worked

04:04.540 --> 04:16.671
together. How did When you got, let's go back now 
to, you're going to enroll as a freshman. How did

04:23.263 --> 04:25.385
you get there on that trip? When I went to 
university, a dear friend of mine, Danny Flores,

04:25.405 --> 04:40.744
his mother, his mother took Danny and David 
Loudell and me, and she drove us up there. I shipped

04:41.344 --> 04:46.150
a footlocker and took a little Samsonite suitcase 
that I'd been given, Describe what was in those two

04:46.838 --> 04:49.721
containers. What did you take with you?

04:54.487 --> 04:54.667
Not much. Not much, Haskell. Towels, sheets, 
underwear.

05:04.698 --> 05:06.460
We didn't have a whole lot of clothes. We just 
didn't in those days. And enough clothes to escape

05:08.723 --> 05:13.208
when you could. And not a whole lot. not a 
typewriter no not a radio uh wasn't a freshman

05:16.302 --> 05:46.005
privilege in our call but uh it wasn't it wasn't on 
the first on the first trip did you i'll call us of it

05:16.302 --> 05:46.005
did you take in a civilian suit or dress coat

05:16.302 --> 05:46.005
i don't think so do you remember how long the drive 
took an hour it's a six hour drive okay okay between

05:16.302 --> 05:46.005
six and seven hours okay even even the expressways 
yeah i drive right through san antonio from Right

05:46.154 --> 05:50.259
up all the, up from Broadway and up Nogalitos. 
Because San Antonio is almost exactly halfway,

05:50.759 --> 05:54.824
isn't it? Exactly. Describe how you, where did you 
get out at and where did you put your stuff? You

06:02.594 --> 06:05.076
know, move me into the dormitory. Yeah.

06:12.105 --> 06:13.346
The other, let me see. I was in, I was in, assigned to 
B-triple-A. There was only one, no, there was two

06:17.481 --> 06:21.286
core areas at the time. We just drove up to the core 
area. The new core area. Around Duncan. Around

06:28.715 --> 06:30.517
Duncan, yeah. Actually, I don't know. We called 
the new area dorms 16, 17, and 18. I was in dorm 17 my

06:37.165 --> 06:39.848
freshman year. And Danny was in the same area. 
Regiment, we were 2nd Regiment, and he was in

06:46.128 --> 06:48.571
Quartermaster's. And then Dave was an engineer, 
so he was over there on Duncan. We were over there by

06:51.555 --> 06:53.718
Sabisa. Oh, you were by Sabisa? Yeah. We had two 
corps airs there. Do you remember any sudden

06:58.944 --> 07:04.892
realizations that you now were in the corps that 
first day? Did anything happen? Any sophomore

07:06.033 --> 07:07.475
pounce on you? No, I really don't remember that 
happening. We got there probably before the

07:11.921 --> 07:15.966
sophomores did. And we kind of had a weekend with 
the first sergeant and maybe a few other people.

07:25.293 --> 07:27.597
And the sophomores got there Sunday night. Did you 
go to fish camp? No. No, I did not. I don't do that any

07:31.644 --> 07:33.387
fish camp tonight. I don't know. No. What about 
registration? Do you remember that, that first

07:37.034 --> 07:39.017
time?

07:41.782 --> 07:42.523
Frankly, no. I really don't remember. I remember 
the registration process. It was just something

07:48.871 --> 07:50.473
you had to do. You didn't ask. We just did what we had 
to do. Tell me about how you got oriented, broken

07:57.542 --> 08:04.871
into, introduced to being a fish. How did the 
sophomores? Frankly, I thought it was a game. It

08:12.173 --> 08:13.494
was, to me, it was a game. And I wasn't intimidated 
by the sophomores. I knew what to expect. Both my

08:18.719 --> 08:20.040
brothers had been in the Corps. And they couldn't 
eat me. And I was in a reasonable outfit. They were

08:28.548 --> 08:31.190
pretty tough, but we were tougher. And we took 
great joy in hazing sophomores. And I think we did a

08:36.235 --> 08:38.737
real good job of it. A lot of people knew my name. 
Describe your room, your fish year, physically.

08:45.934 --> 08:46.575
What was in it? What did it look like? Okay, we had, 
you know, you walk in, depending on what side of

08:47.776 --> 09:05.292
the, the laboratories were, say if I walk in, the 
laboratories on the right, we actually had a

08:47.776 --> 09:05.292
closet behind the door, and then you had a, of 
course, the other closet from the other unit, I

08:47.776 --> 09:05.292
guess, was there, too. We had a laboratory. We had a 
double metal... metal bed, bunk bed. And they each

09:13.890 --> 09:17.052
came with a mattress, and I think they came with a 
pillow too. And there was two desks at the end.

09:19.995 --> 09:25.560
There was a window at the end with a radiator, one of 
those steam jobbies. And the closet was small. We

09:29.043 --> 09:30.724
didn't have much. And we got more clothes there 
assigned to us by the department, the military

09:30.865 --> 09:40.433
science department. and then we probably brought 
up there, I think we must have had at least two or

09:41.206 --> 09:47.213
three uniforms issued and fatigues. Of course, we 
supplemented that and bought more other uniforms

09:47.534 --> 09:57.306
that really had form fit, so you wouldn't look like 
cadet slouch. Did you have anything, any

09:57.326 --> 09:59.929
decoration on the wall or the floor? Nothing. 
Curtains? Absolutely not. And what floor? Fourth

10:06.597 --> 10:07.618
floor. Tufts, as a freshman, are the best for 
studying. Oh, I hadn't thought about that. But you

10:13.206 --> 10:15.009
meet a lot of people. And you also get very fast 
going upstairs. And you can just slip around the

10:17.333 --> 10:26.248
end of the metal banisters going up and down, where 
you just grease out those things. But you had to

10:26.609 --> 10:28.692
meet them anyway, sooner or later. So you might as 
well just do it. And so we got to meet all the

10:30.936 --> 10:35.884
freshmen. And sophomores and seniors, there were 
the other two. I was in B-triple-A. Did it have a

10:41.018 --> 10:42.721
nickname? No, we didn't use nicknames at that 
time. We were B-anti-aircraft artillery, and we

10:45.985 --> 10:49.710
were proud of it. And these kids today are proud of 
what they are, and that's okay. But A-triple-A and

10:54.136 --> 10:57.100
B-triple-A and C-triple-A were the same door. And 
the way the selection process went, whichever

10:57.641 --> 11:05.331
unit was the top unit in the scoring for general war 
got their choice of floors. And if you were the best

11:05.952 --> 11:15.505
out there in that battalion, you always took the 
top floor because it was the quietest, even though

11:05.952 --> 11:15.505
you had to go up three flights. But at that age, and 
even now, it's not a problem. Take me, let's make

11:18.749 --> 11:22.434
believe we're in the middle of the fall, your fish 
year. Take me through a typical class day. In other

11:27.020 --> 11:29.863
words, a Monday through Friday. What time did you 
get up and so forth? Ah. I know when we got up, we

11:35.112 --> 12:02.824
didn't have a whole long time to get ready and hit 
the quad for formation to mark to breakfast and the

11:35.112 --> 12:02.824
whistle jock would run up and down the halls 
blowing the whistle and saying how long time it was

11:35.112 --> 12:02.824
to formation and you'd get a I'd wake up and then 
you'd have a warning to the time, to formation.

12:08.563 --> 12:09.444
You'd want your breakfast. And then we would, if we 
were really quick, we'd do some of our room before

12:10.125 --> 12:21.417
we left or when we got back when you, when you tidied 
up your room and your, got your, got your things

12:10.125 --> 12:21.417
together. But you had to leave your room straight. 
You had to leave it absolutely tip-top. And a lot of

12:25.401 --> 12:32.068
time before we'd go to bed at night, we had 
everything except maybe wiping down your lab or

12:32.555 --> 12:38.502
clean a mirror or straighten out something that 
might have, you know, beds were always made. I

12:39.944 --> 12:48.154
can't remember if we made them before we left or 
probably after because you had to hustle with two

12:39.944 --> 12:48.154
people to get out to formation and make sure you had 
all your grass on. It took a long time at first, but

12:48.214 --> 12:55.003
then after a while, after you got, you knew the 
game, what they were looking for, it wasn't a

12:48.214 --> 12:55.003
problem. Right, and you all fell in where? In front 
of the dorm. And march to? March to Sabisa. Then go

13:02.522 --> 13:05.446
back to, after breakfast, go back? Go back on your 
own. And do what? Well, you finish cleaning up your

13:07.749 --> 13:09.631
room. Most of us had class at 8 o'clock. Did you ever 
take care of a sophomore's room also, or a

13:12.034 --> 13:15.319
junior's? No. You didn't have that? I did not do 
that. All right. Then noon, did you all fall out and

13:17.802 --> 13:22.208
march? Absolutely. We'd have a... Formation, 
probably 10 to five minutes before the hour, and

13:24.428 --> 13:29.694
march to lunch. And you were at formation. 
Everybody was at formation. Most seniors were at

13:33.759 --> 13:36.402
formation, too. Of course, there wasn't any place 
else to eat. You either ate there or at the MSC. And

13:40.606 --> 13:44.010
everybody went. All right. Then in the 
afternoons,

13:44.291 --> 13:49.577
what if you had any spare time? Well, I never had a 
whole lot of spare time. maybe that first

13:53.791 --> 14:01.861
semester, but that time you're trying to adapt to 
college life and playing the game.

14:04.704 --> 14:07.848
But we took too many classes, bottom line. I think 
we were dumb or we weren't counseled as well as kids

14:07.908 --> 14:12.493
are today. But consequently, you'd end up, you're 
taking 17, 18 hours and maybe you only pass 14 or 15.

14:19.622 --> 14:22.245
And a lot of us, A lot of us did that. I'm not ashamed 
of it. But the important thing is to never quit. I

14:29.746 --> 14:37.776
flunked

14:29.746 --> 14:37.776
countless, three times before I passed it. Passed 
it on the fourth time, but I never quit.

14:43.302 --> 14:45.225
But we always had time to get back. We had 
intramurals. That was part of our company

14:47.467 --> 14:50.511
strategy Everybody participate. Professional 
played with freshmen, then upperclassmen had

14:52.224 --> 14:55.429
their own deals. We would march a lot.

15:00.156 --> 15:09.189
Before dinner, we weren't doing intramurals

15:00.156 --> 15:09.189
unless somebody had someplace to be. The unit had 
things to keep us busy and keep us on task. Learn how

15:15.539 --> 15:20.346
to march was important to this group and important 
to me. There was always training going on. How was

15:24.399 --> 15:29.705
supper different in routine if it was to lunch and 
breakfast? Had a little more time. And there was

15:32.348 --> 15:39.537
more time for old, trained freshmen. And it was a 
sophomore job. And seniors and juniors would play

15:42.321 --> 15:45.505
with us. You know how that goes. Describe the task 
of a typical fish Well we sat in the middle and

15:50.701 --> 15:56.367
you're passing stuff and or in the hot corner. In 
the hot corner you got the food from the waiter at

15:56.687 --> 16:20.472
that time it was family style and the waiters would 
come and you'd have to you know grab it off the

15:56.687 --> 16:20.472
waiters and pass it around but usually the juniors 
and seniors sat on the outside fresh on the hot

15:56.687 --> 16:20.472
corner and then I think there was eight to the table 
if I remember correctly it could have been ten and

15:56.687 --> 16:20.472
you had at least one or two sophomores at the table 
and One or two freshmen. I understand that some

16:22.723 --> 16:26.126
Aggie food had a special Aggie name. They all had 
names. Can you remember as many of those as you can?

16:30.189 --> 16:30.790
Oh, probably. Bread was gunwadi. Mustard was 
baby. Eggs were cackle, I believe. Bullmeck,

16:40.178 --> 16:41.900
obviously, was meat. And there were just a lot 
of... Beans? I don't remember what beans were.

16:49.447 --> 16:49.767
Corn? Ketchup? Ketchup and blood, yeah. Let's 
see, tea, coffee,

16:54.748 --> 17:00.454
dessert. Dessert was a kush. And all dessert was 
kush? All dessert was kush. It was pie or cake?

17:06.960 --> 17:07.400
Yeah, everything. And from there came the kush 
questions. Did you ever, when you were home, did

17:12.305 --> 17:17.290
you ever forget and asked for something. I'm sure 
we all did. And maybe some of them I did on purpose.

17:22.323 --> 17:23.804
In an Aggie fashion? Yeah. Oh, yeah. Let's see. All 
right. Now, did your freshman year, did you and

17:28.969 --> 17:35.396
your classmates ever wait till all the 
upperclassmen left? If you wanted to eat. So you

17:36.997 --> 17:38.098
could really eat? Sure. But they always left in 
time to make sure we had enough time to eat. I mean,

17:42.963 --> 17:44.585
they didn't stick around. They had to go, too. But I 
never left the mess hall hungry. I never, ever left

17:49.791 --> 17:51.512
the mess hall hungry. In general, what was the 
quality of the food? I thought it was great.

17:56.777 --> 17:58.038
Frankly, it was good. Did you have a particular 
favorite dish, as you think back on it? I had a real

18:03.483 --> 18:12.992
standard stomach, and there may have been some 
favorite, but it was reasonably good. Was there

18:13.132 --> 18:16.555
any that you all really disliked? I've not heard of 
any. I was just wondering. I don't even think they

18:18.516 --> 18:22.220
ever service . That's one of the things I'm already 
fond of. Everything else is fine. Define hazing as

18:28.665 --> 18:31.748
it was in your day. What happened in or around the 
dorms that an investigator today would say, oh,

18:32.929 --> 18:39.495
that's hazing? Nobody ever touched me. Nobody 
ever hit me. Now, we might have been out at a company

18:43.318 --> 18:46.221
party or something. And if you wanted to trade 
licks with a broom with a sophomore and you felt

18:46.589 --> 18:55.222
like that was as close as I would say, never. Nobody 
ever beat my ass. I don't remember. Not many have

18:58.427 --> 19:00.490
said that. Usually a broomstick or part of a 
baseball bat. Nobody. Absolutely. Only in fun,

19:07.100 --> 19:11.787
like I say, and we pride ourselves on being able to 
take a lick or give a lick. But you would trade, and

19:12.138 --> 19:14.441
that was okay. And some of them were popping pretty 
good. All right, but push-ups and duck walking,

19:16.804 --> 19:21.289
what else?

19:24.333 --> 19:31.281
We didn't run like the court runs today, but I 
learned hold the wall up. You heard that game?

19:33.124 --> 19:33.604
Describe it. Well, where you put your back on the 
wall and you form a chair-like with your legs, with

19:33.925 --> 19:41.554
your with your thighs being parallel to the floor. 
And it really builds up your legs really good.

19:48.363 --> 19:51.848
Sometimes you do it so long, they start to tremble 
and you fall down. But it builds a little

19:51.908 --> 19:58.956
character, especially if you're trying to get 
your attention. I can't recall what all the...

19:59.056 --> 20:03.281
Now, would a sophomore direct you to hold the ball 
up? Oh, yeah.

20:06.805 --> 20:11.170
So be freshman, give me five. Would that be 
push-up? Five or more, I suspect. But now the

20:14.719 --> 20:18.707
juniors do push-up because they love their class 
year. Four guys from 99 are going to have a problem.

20:21.652 --> 20:22.554
But we didn't do that. So we didn't do push-ups. And 
then after a while, we'd just do it ourselves just

20:24.838 --> 20:30.389
to build up. We could compete with sophomores and 
show them that, hey, I can take it. And we duck

20:35.281 --> 20:36.623
walked. We duck walked a lot. Duck walked in your 
raincoat, in your helmet, liner. We did that, even

20:42.330 --> 20:46.094
the sophomores, when we stole the junior blouses. 
And we had a lot of fun with them on that. Describe

20:48.737 --> 20:49.378
that. Okay. When we were sophomores, you know, the 
junior ball comes up, and the custom, the

20:51.561 --> 21:02.434
tradition was the sophomores would go over and 
steal the junior's uniform so that they couldn't

20:51.561 --> 21:02.434
go to the ball. And the game was they would, torment 
you and haze you until you say, we give up. And of

21:07.885 --> 21:10.308
course, nobody ever gives up. Finally, the CO will 
come and say, all right, guys, give it back to them.

21:14.793 --> 21:16.235
Oh, okay, we don't want to, but we'll do it. And we 
had a couple of juniors, we had a couple of

21:16.895 --> 21:31.292
gentlemen who were, I remember Dan Greenberg in 
Houston, he was a vet major, and he wore glasses

21:16.895 --> 21:31.292
about that thick of Coke bottles, and he didn't get 
a contract, but There was one other, one other, I

21:32.268 --> 21:34.871
can't remember who that was. But anyway, when we 
said we're gonna, we had a sophomore meeting and

21:34.891 --> 21:41.437
we're going to steal the blouses. And I said, you 
know, we can't leave Dan Greenberg out. I mean,

21:45.100 --> 21:46.282
he's part of this group. And so we, and there was one 
other. So anyway, we said the mission. I think I

21:50.946 --> 21:55.050
went to Greenberg's room and his roommate was 
there. And I said, Dan said for me to come up and pick

21:55.090 --> 21:57.652
up a suit. He wanted me to take it to the cleaners. 
Grab her suit. It's the funniest thing. We were the

22:03.146 --> 22:05.670
first meeting that they called the sophomores in. 
And they're sitting on the beds, and we're sitting

22:05.690 --> 22:13.824
on the floor like freshmen again with our knees 
under our chins. And bang, the door just busts

22:13.864 --> 22:16.448
open. And damn Greenberg walks in, says, where's 
that damn bully Fernandez? He stole my suit. Sir.

22:24.922 --> 22:25.984
Anyway, so yeah. You learn a lot of things in that. 
There was an incident, and I probably won't touch

22:29.017 --> 22:45.453
on that, that happened that

22:29.017 --> 22:45.453
sophomores learn, even at that stage, juniors 
rather, even at that stage, you've got to watch

22:29.017 --> 22:45.453
what you say. And that's the place to learn, to make 
a mistake, not after your professional life or

22:46.394 --> 22:53.901
other things. But it isn't fun. You're saying 
politely. Here's somebody said something very

22:56.137 --> 22:59.240
indiscreet. Well, it was one of those things that 
is not acceptable. It's one of the rules. You can't

23:05.406 --> 23:06.047
do that. And it was said. And everybody just got up, 
the sophomores. And it was directed at me. And we

23:13.895 --> 23:15.537
hadn't rehearsed that. And we were duck walking. 
And the term was, do you? get the duck walking

23:26.512 --> 23:28.774
faster. Do you understand that? Or do you want me to 
tell you in Spanish? And it wasn't rehearsed.

23:34.700 --> 23:36.221
Everybody got up in unison. I said, you violated 
the rules of the game. And we all left and went to one

23:39.704 --> 23:41.786
of the rooms. And they screwed up. That night, they 
couldn't touch us anymore. And actually, we beat

23:46.951 --> 23:49.073
them at their game. And it wasn't malicious. It 
wasn't anything. And this... The young man that

23:54.811 --> 23:57.175
said it was from the valley. And there was never any 
later retribution for young people. Absolutely

24:02.384 --> 24:05.710
not. I guess that was even the one I had to say. That 
was the closest to a lot of popular questions. Were

24:11.720 --> 24:17.190
there anything, being a minority, being a 
Mexican-American, was there any... Anything

24:17.457 --> 24:19.400
ever directed at you? No, not ever. Never. I'm not 
texting anything. Now, the people that I've

24:22.304 --> 24:36.405
interviewed up through the war, through World War 
II, have said that there were nicknames that were

24:22.304 --> 24:36.405
not at all intended to be derisive. Oh, 
absolutely. But that they referred to some of the

24:37.567 --> 24:41.333
Jewish students as Jew boy. And... Those are 
Lebanese background. We had our first sergeant,

24:50.943 --> 24:57.048
Paul Moenis, a Greek, and we all called him Greek. 
We were proud of those kinds of things. I had a

24:59.230 --> 25:01.773
nickname, which was Bully, but I grew up with that. 
When my friends went up with me, to me, that was my

25:02.193 --> 25:08.479
only name because I never went by Raul. People say, 
when they drop handles, what's your name? I say

25:12.703 --> 25:14.565
Bully because that's what everybody ever called 
me. Alright, was there ever, let's work on the

25:14.697 --> 25:23.509
minority bit of it, was there ever any, were you 
ever called Mexican or Latino? Never. Never a

25:24.511 --> 25:25.272
problem. Was that true, as far as you know, pretty 
well campus-wide? Absolutely. But at that time,

25:29.858 --> 25:33.684
there were no blacks in Texas A&M, by law. And I grew 
up in Laredo, and I didn't even know the minority. I

25:39.284 --> 25:41.668
didn't find out maybe until I was 25 or 30. I don't 
know. But in Laredo, everybody spoke Spanish and

25:43.090 --> 25:47.357
everybody spoke English. And it was a great 
community by that standard. Now, you were

25:54.522 --> 25:56.605
bilingual. Absolutely, yes. And did that, at A&M, 
was that anything unusual? Was that to your

26:04.777 --> 26:07.020
advantage or disadvantage? Well, I got an A in a 
three-hour course, which is a great place

26:07.340 --> 26:16.073
to compete. It was an advantage, not as far as being 
in the Corps or anything else. It's always been an

26:21.641 --> 26:24.124
advantage to me. As a student,

26:24.374 --> 26:30.223
it didn't make any difference. Did you, was your 
freshman roommate, your fish hole lady, did that

26:30.243 --> 26:35.470
person become a special friend? I went through 
several. Oh, so. Remember when you sat down that

26:38.435 --> 26:45.926
first day, the first sergeant told us, you know, 
look to your left, look to your right, because that

26:38.435 --> 26:45.926
guy's not going to be here at the end of this year. We 
lost a lot of them. I don't think my freshman

26:49.400 --> 26:54.045
roommates made it. There's only about 11 or 12 of 
us. Are there some special friends, though, from

26:59.031 --> 27:02.095
your class? Christ. Who are the most special? 
Those are the friends that you have forever and for

27:05.559 --> 27:08.502
life. Who are the most special ones? Well, all the 
guys in my outfit were special. Maybe one or two

27:14.690 --> 27:18.394
that had others, but we were so close because... 
Most of us, and even those that did have something,

27:18.593 --> 27:24.641
you didn't know it. And, you know, I can, well, Paul 
Moenis, he was also a CE major, civil engineering,

27:25.422 --> 27:42.225
and Wesley Hill, who's now the highway engineer, 
state of Texas, Mike Woodson, Tommy Lohman is my

27:25.422 --> 27:42.225
dear friend. We still go skiing together. Our 
wives are close. Our wives are closer than we are, I

27:44.628 --> 27:46.491
think. And they just tolerate us and invite us 
along wherever we go. But some I don't see, and some

27:51.750 --> 27:55.896
have died. But John Thomas, our class agent, was in 
our activity. All right, describe for me some of

28:03.988 --> 28:10.297
the pranks, the good bull that you knew about, 
whether you were involved in or not. Oh, I was

28:10.818 --> 28:12.160
involved in most of it. All right, describe some of 
them. The question of the drown outs are always

28:14.787 --> 28:17.211
special. That's a lot of fun to drop a waste can of 
water on a sophomore. When I was a sophomore, I've

28:24.742 --> 28:26.946
done it a million. It's okay, the scar I have under 
my chin, diving out of bed and catching the

28:27.487 --> 28:39.445
backside of that freshman and I missed and I fell 
down and got a scar to prove it.

28:41.247 --> 28:44.431
We, let me see, some of the real neat things that we 
did there. Poor Buddy Majan. Buddy, he's from the

28:45.272 --> 28:47.475
Valley. And one time we had a fish, we had a fish beer 
bust. Totally illegal, obviously. But we went

28:56.706 --> 28:59.470
out, us freshmen, and we had a party. And so we were 
out there in the, some open farm, ranch land,

28:59.490 --> 29:07.820
something like that. Maybe out in the pits, I don't 
know. And we were out there. drinking beer and

29:11.622 --> 29:23.261
joined fellowship and the poor armadillo came 
through the area and it was night and that's when

29:11.622 --> 29:23.261
armadillos come out. And so we, of course it was a 
bunch of freshmen trying to catch an armadillo and

29:23.281 --> 29:27.648
we finally caught him. And we didn't hurt him, we 
just caught him. And I said, well now we got him.

29:32.736 --> 29:34.339
What are we going to do? Somebody said, let's put 
him in Buddy Major's bed. And so this armadillo was

29:38.097 --> 29:40.861
half scared to death. And he might, you know, he was 
trying to act possum. I think he was half possum. So

29:43.965 --> 29:50.935
when we got back to the dorm, we were probably a 
little rowdy. And the sophomores always need a

29:50.955 --> 29:55.080
good reason to get after you. But that armadillo 
ended up in Buddy Major's bed. And Bobby Muller, he

30:02.691 --> 30:04.714
was He frogged in, so it was already our second 
semester. Bobby Mueller, Frog Mueller, was one of

30:09.134 --> 30:16.862
Major's favorites because Bobby was a frog. And as 
a matter of fact, he called him into his room, and he

30:16.902 --> 30:23.628
was sitting there fussing for something. And he 
was in the process of getting into bed. And I mean,

30:27.292 --> 30:32.777
he came out of that bed like a rocket. You know, Joe 
Fenton. Joe was Buddy's roommate, and Joe

30:34.616 --> 30:37.480
witnessed that. That was so funny. I could just, 
and Joe tells it even better. I mean, it's just

30:41.126 --> 30:42.447
hilarious. And Bobby was the one that put it in 
there. And Buddy didn't know that, but he just, you

30:46.333 --> 30:49.898
know, he was getting him in there for some kind of 
training. And, you know, we would always find.

30:52.361 --> 30:56.507
Now, what was the retribution for that? Oh, I'm 
sure we paid the price. Now, that's the kind of good

30:58.810 --> 31:03.557
story that I very much want in here. Do you remember 
any others? No, that one's special. Let me think

31:10.737 --> 31:11.858
here. Did you all ever put any or know of any 
explosives that were put in someone's room? Those

31:17.946 --> 31:18.807
were dangerous. I hear there's some people that 
might have done that. I've never had the pleasure

31:20.709 --> 31:22.431
of doing that. No Babel bombs? Babel bomb. Yeah, 
there was, you know, you really had to, they

31:24.454 --> 31:27.638
really...
