WEBVTT

00:05.954 --> 00:11.021
¿Dónde será?

00:11.041 --> 00:12.182
Sus tías en la escuela. Ah, sí. Esa familia venía, 
vino de otros estados. Y esa familia estaba vecina

00:19.712 --> 00:22.216
con nosotros. Ellos desmontaron ese lugar. 
Nosotros estábamos como aquí. Esa familia llegó y

00:27.122 --> 00:29.726
compró el lugar. Era monte. Enfrente de nosotros. 
Eran el papá y la mamá. Y dos muchachas, que eran sus

00:36.278 --> 00:39.863
hijas de ellos. Bueno, ya los señores estaban poco 
grandes. Esas muchachas eran muchachas ya

00:42.126 --> 00:48.594
mayores, nomás que ellas nunca se habían casado. 
Esas muchachas, ni nosotros ni ellas entendían,

00:50.397 --> 00:56.785
pero era buena familia. Then, as chance would have 
it, she said she was going to be a teacher. Nosotros

01:07.700 --> 01:18.417
conocíamos por mi papá, ese señor que vive también 
por ese camino, le decían Steary Well. Ese señor

01:18.457 --> 01:24.066
era un trabajador y era un señor solo, americano. Y 
él, yo no sé cómo se hacía entender con mi papá, pero

01:25.087 --> 01:30.396
pues sería por sus modos. Él tenía muy buenas 
amistades con la gente. American. And that man

01:35.320 --> 01:39.846
also looked for my father a lot. This boy, he was 
already a big boy, but he hadn't been married.

01:44.814 --> 01:49.240
Those girls arrived there for new ones. They liked 
it. So these girls went out for a walk. I saw that

01:54.989 --> 01:58.434
they dressed very well. And those boys came and 
took them for a walk. And my father would say, this

02:03.505 --> 02:09.752
is Tiri Güell, he says, he's taking the girls for a 
walk. And I would hear my father talking. And they

02:15.219 --> 02:16.861
would go. And another time they would say, they 
would go to a carnival with them and everything.

02:24.129 --> 02:33.360
Then the other sister got married to another boy, 
also of an older American age, who was called

02:24.129 --> 02:33.360
Güelle. Willie Hatchick. Willie Hatchick. Sí, yo 
no sé, será apelativo, yo no sé, pero así le decían a

02:37.805 --> 02:43.877
él, el Willie. Entonces, ella salía con ese 
muchacho, la otra muchacha. Then came the time

02:51.363 --> 02:57.573
that she went to school. And I was her friend, 
because we were neighbors. She said, you here? And

03:07.550 --> 03:11.577
I said, my friend, yes. Oh, she was very pleased. 
Well, what do you think? What I learned, my memory,

03:17.553 --> 03:22.823
I think my memory has been very bad. Well, I don't 
think it's that bad because I'm saying all this,

03:23.003 --> 03:28.192
but now I've always lost it. Well, then she gave me a 
book. You know the books that were there before.

03:39.068 --> 03:43.572
Look, this story was the story that I learned. I 
learned to do the first numbers because I never

03:43.592 --> 03:51.120
knew anything. The 2, the 5, I only know up to the 60. 
Yes, I know them all. But the ones I have the most are

03:56.045 --> 04:01.350
the 80, 60. Well, I was learning that because she 
taught me. Then she gave me a little book and I

04:05.900 --> 04:10.267
started writing letters. Well, I did write them 
and I did learn. And she told me, I learned them in

04:14.253 --> 04:17.898
English. Maybe if I had followed, I would have 
learned. So I told them in English. Well, I always

04:24.969 --> 04:26.271
kept them. Los conocí, los conozco, y conozco 
todo, y sé leer español poquito, y bueno, pues yo

04:27.685 --> 04:36.113
estuve un mes en la escuela. Entonces me dio un 
librito que decía mi acuerdo, lo sabría de

04:38.535 --> 04:56.612
memoria, pero no, lo supe leer y conocí las letras, 
y donde este era un niño, y ese niño se trataba de su,

04:38.535 --> 04:56.612
yo creo que, of what he, his name, and Yasina, 
right? And he was called Will. Well, and I said,

05:06.839 --> 05:12.746
this is Will, how do you do, Will? That's the story 
he had, and she told me that. And how do you do, May?

05:20.556 --> 05:21.517
How do you do, May?

05:24.340 --> 05:26.683
And she, well, so I said, Well, no. Since my mother 
got sick, when I was in school for a month, I had to

05:29.214 --> 05:38.235
leave school. Then they took me out of school 
because she had babies of all sizes, and I left

05:38.255 --> 05:45.752
school. I think, I was liking it because I was 
resting there. I was there, well, you know the

05:52.253 --> 05:54.376
classes at school. It was a little difficult for me 
when they are like this, they put them like this.

06:00.984 --> 06:01.184
See? Yes. Uh-huh, the numbers. And I think I was 
practicing. Well, it was very little time for me to

06:10.236 --> 06:14.542
do all that. So, My cousin, I asked my cousin and she 
asked me what to do. I said, no, because then I won't

06:19.055 --> 06:23.022
know if you make them for me. She said, well, so you 
can make them soon. She said, yes, but I don't know

06:27.128 --> 06:29.933
then. Well, but since the time was so short, I 
didn't learn much. I learned a few words only. Yes.

06:39.091 --> 06:46.321
Bueno, siempre agarré palabras de saludar de 
Asina, pocas palabras. Pues me retiré entonces y

06:48.104 --> 06:54.113
allí nos fuimos.

06:57.598 --> 07:00.923
Entonces vino la guerra muy dura. La guerra. Hubo, 
yo creo, sería por la guerra o sería por... that

07:08.521 --> 07:15.375
there was destruction, or I don't know what the 
cause would be. The story is that they reduced our

07:15.395 --> 07:19.784
food a lot. We had to sweeten the coffee with brown 
sugar. They didn't have to give us flour. My

07:29.851 --> 07:43.828
father,

07:29.851 --> 07:43.828
because I barely remember, because very few took 
us through that big street that goes straight to

07:29.851 --> 07:43.828
the sea. There was a small shop, very small, and 
those were Arabs. And those Arabs were the ones who

07:49.995 --> 07:55.842
served my father food, with and without money. And 
because of so much knowledge and a lot of family,

07:57.458 --> 08:09.678
instead of giving it to my dad in secret, I think, I 
don't know, they would give him a grain of flour. It

08:10.519 --> 08:13.925
was all they could give my dad, a grain of flour, 
because there was no flour. And if there was, they

08:13.945 --> 08:19.534
wanted to send it to other states. So what they did 
was a lot of corn flour. They gave it to my father

08:23.847 --> 08:27.338
because the family was big. A lot of corn flour. And 
now, before, you didn't know how to make corn

08:29.774 --> 08:38.046
bread. You made it. I didn't make it, my mom made it. 
My mom only made it because that man, Jose Jan, gave

08:42.934 --> 08:49.203
my dad a lot of Guaramilk. And that bread, my mom 
beat it with a lot of Guaramilk. And then, some pans

08:54.491 --> 08:58.617
that had legs and a... A lid, they would put embers 
on top of the lid and they would put the corn bread

08:58.765 --> 09:06.415
inside that pan. And then below, they would put 
embers and they would put that pan there. And that

09:13.345 --> 09:14.947
pan would cook there. If you would put a little 
heat, the golden breads would come out, but they

09:15.408 --> 09:22.377
would come out hard. They didn't come out as fluffy 
as these. Well, because they didn't have the

09:25.562 --> 09:31.790
subtleties that these have now. Naturally, for us 
it was a very good bread, because we didn't know

09:31.870 --> 09:37.759
them anymore. But it was very good, and that was 
what we did. Yes, we got tired of eating it. pero no

09:47.298 --> 09:53.548
nos morimos de hambre porque había mucha harina de 
maíz y mi mamá nos hacía los panes. Y en esos

09:55.411 --> 10:12.597
sartenes, que ahora todo tiran a la basura, todo lo 
de años atrás lo tiran a la basura porque ahora todo

09:55.411 --> 10:12.597
es moderno, pero es más mejor lo que pasó than what 
we have now. Yes. Both in the health of the person

10:16.208 --> 10:24.075
and in the things that are useful. Yes. Because 
what we had before was very... everything was very

10:24.295 --> 10:30.881
well built. Yes. From everything to everything 
and even in the person. Yes. Because now the person

10:37.267 --> 10:41.571
is like como todos los que hay ahora. And it has a lot 
of people, a lot of medicine, a

10:46.242 --> 11:01.061
lot of... a lot of... a lot of use that has happened 
now, both in people, in food, and in everything.

11:01.462 --> 11:06.628
It's more modern, but now people die more than in 
the past years. Yes. And there weren't the tools

11:07.289 --> 11:12.316
that there are now. And in the past years, Años 
pasados no había lo que hay ahora. Y ahora se muere

11:17.927 --> 11:23.997
más la gente porque ahora andamos más recio de 
todo. Y por eso uno no vive en paz. Uno vive la

11:28.304 --> 11:31.129
carrera y por eso se muere más pronto. Porque vive 
la carrera. Bueno, entonces, esto de mi...

11:42.335 --> 11:52.544
Terminó en esto que de la escuela, al poco tiempo 
nos fuimos de ese lugar, de esa familia.

11:55.227 --> 12:06.356
Nos fuimos como el veinti...

11:55.227 --> 12:06.356
Como el veinti...

11:55.227 --> 12:06.356
Como el veinticinco, yo creo, de ese lugar. Pa'l 
rancho ese de José Yaliga.

12:13.233 --> 12:15.616
We changed everything. I think two trips to Guayín 
took my father to that place. Because at that time

12:23.646 --> 12:30.795
that man was a very fat man. He was an American man. I 
don't know what race he was of. But he had his own

12:37.504 --> 12:39.426
customs. And his appearance made me think he was a 
Mexican. He was a fat man. His mustache was very

12:49.853 --> 13:07.337
black, a very colored man, a very fat and tall man, 
owner of many mules, many cows, a very large ranch

12:49.853 --> 13:07.337
that he had, and here is still his ranch. Well, he 
had another ranch in Sandias. He planted a lot of

13:12.158 --> 13:15.682
sandias there. And he used a lot of cowboy hat. And 
he was very Mexican. His whole family, because he

13:20.427 --> 13:28.697
had big boys and girls and everything. His oldest 
girl was called May. and very good to his whole

13:32.984 --> 13:41.952
family, and a very good boss that he was with my 
father and everything. So, I don't know how my

13:43.113 --> 13:54.163
father would fix it there, but my father had a lot of 
land. He said that for cotton, for cabbage.

14:00.889 --> 14:00.949
So, My father would take care of the cows in the 
farm. Every morning, at 3 or 4 in the morning, my

14:08.986 --> 14:16.743
father would be there, taking care of the cows in 
the farm. He would take a lot of milk to the house.

14:22.327 --> 14:36.266
The others would get up to have lunch with the 
mules, so that when they all went to work, those

14:22.327 --> 14:36.266
mules would have lunch before going to work. All of 
them. You could see the line of pure men working.

14:45.659 --> 14:46.039
So... At that time, my brothers worked. My two 
brothers and my father. There were three brothers

14:53.118 --> 14:56.964
who were already working. My brothers earned a 
very good salary. It was a good salary, I say, in

14:59.588 --> 15:04.135
those years. They earned money. They earned one 
peso per day. So there were three of us. mis tres

15:11.264 --> 15:18.363
hermanos, pero no sé si el peso por hora o el peso por 
día, pero más bien era el peso por día. Bueno, tres

15:18.383 --> 15:21.932
pesos ganaban porque eran tres. So we would get up 
at four in the morning to make them lunch. They

15:30.993 --> 15:34.118
would be ready for lunch when they got up. When they 
were playing, when it was dawn, my brothers and my

15:34.358 --> 15:41.828
father were already at the edge of the field. 
Because in California they call it fil, here we

15:42.753 --> 15:53.026
call it labor. Well, that was early in

15:53.566 --> 16:05.301
the morning, early in the morning. Then, you know, 
my father sowed the first year and he got a lot of

16:05.905 --> 16:15.583
cabbage. And since I was the eldest and my two 
brothers and my father, my mother never worked. My

16:21.013 --> 16:23.618
mother was always at home. No, I never worked. 
Well, then, I...

16:28.906 --> 16:32.371
I don't know what would have happened to me. My 
mother didn't tell me why. I think she didn't know.

16:35.255 --> 16:36.677
I knew more. I wore my

16:36.697 --> 16:42.625
brothers' pants. My father told me, we are going to 
cut cabbage. We are going to start cutting

16:49.094 --> 16:52.960
cabbage.

16:55.023 --> 16:58.187
Soon I got ready. and we would go, we would stick to 
the cart, each of us would grab our knives, there

16:59.112 --> 17:08.765
were four of us. Here was the cart, do you know what a 
cart is? It's a box. And then two wheels. Two

17:15.150 --> 17:15.471
wheels. And then a mule. Or a horse, whatever it 
was. And here you were cutting the cabbage and here

17:19.737 --> 17:27.047
you were throwing it. Here goes the other one 
cutting the cabbage and throwing it. See? And the

17:31.273 --> 17:34.097
horse walking. So we would go out, fill up, and make 
cabbage. And my brothers and I, I think that's why I

17:41.054 --> 17:46.760
like the ball. Because if I was down, I was here, my 
brothers and I would throw a lot of cabbage, and

17:47.841 --> 17:58.692
cabbage, and cabbage, and cabbage, and cabbage. 
And well, that was the job we did. The whole season

18:00.154 --> 18:04.118
of cutting the cabbage, we would cut it. So my dad 
made a lot of money. Then my dad said he was going to

18:11.609 --> 18:21.544
buy a truck of the Ford that was used in those years. 
He bought a Ford, a new Ford truck, because my dad

18:21.564 --> 18:30.157
always liked to buy, but good. So he bought a truck 
of those. But what I didn't like was the color,

18:34.152 --> 18:39.728
because he bought it in black. Everything in black 
and black. But it looked very pretty. My father

18:44.140 --> 18:46.306
laughed at it. We didn't laugh at it, not even my 
brothers. My father was a driver. And then it

18:51.697 --> 18:53.279
changed. We, the people, there were two people who 
had a car. My father bought that truck. But our

19:03.872 --> 19:14.065
first friends were, they lived, they were John Doe 
workers. It was the Cuellar family. They bought

19:17.019 --> 19:22.425
Mr. John Donne's car. It was a Dodge. That was Mr. 
John Donne's car. It would be his first car, I don't

19:30.033 --> 19:31.415
know. So he bought another car, a more modern one, 
and he gave the car to that family. So they were...

19:42.479 --> 19:55.230
the family called them the rich because they 
already had a car and they called them the rich. So

19:55.250 --> 20:08.762
when we bought that truck, we were the richest 
because that's what they called us because we

19:55.250 --> 20:08.762
didn't have any friends yet. Only the Gonzales 
family had a truck. Well, then we didn't go to

20:13.259 --> 20:17.066
Guayina anymore, to Corpos. We would do half a day, 
one day to get to Corpos. But the whole family would

20:20.693 --> 20:24.079
go to Guayina. You see? My father, like me, I 
imposed on my family. My father would take us all

20:30.852 --> 20:36.162
and say, let's go to the store. It was a store that 
was, I think it was also Arabs or Italians or I don't

20:37.103 --> 20:41.794
know. By the way, I don't know, it's here on this big 
street too, which is the one that has always been

20:41.814 --> 20:52.539
full of bodies, that street. And my father took us 
there. And there, that's every year that there was

20:54.839 --> 20:59.847
money. There he would take us and he would take us 
all and he would say, he would take my mother and he

20:59.867 --> 21:07.279
would take us all. They take everything you want, 
everything you need to buy. So, Well, we didn't

21:12.490 --> 21:15.975
know what color we could look for. We just liked 
whatever it was and we bought it. My mom didn't tell

21:20.122 --> 21:23.367
us anything. She didn't... Mom, we like it, it's 
good. My dad, it's good. He just took us to choose.

21:33.383 --> 21:34.144
So... I used to buy and pay my dad a lot, because it 
was for everyone. I used to buy chestnuts, beans,

21:42.485 --> 21:49.591
everything I needed. I used to pay together, but 
only in one store. It was all there. So, for so long

21:58.980 --> 22:01.583
that I was a little older, eh, este, el señor es el 
dueño de la tienda. Tenía yo toda la confianza y

22:08.010 --> 22:11.800
decía, Lupita, es muy desgustada. Ándale, 
Lupita. Come in here and look for all the shoes you

22:14.168 --> 22:17.852
want. Come on, you check the shoes you like, 
because you are very disliked. Well, check all the

22:24.339 --> 22:25.761
ones you like. Well, I went in there to look for the 
shoes I wanted. He says, you Lupe, you are very

22:32.128 --> 22:36.132
disliked, you are never going to get married. He 
says, because you, look, you don't like anything.

22:40.778 --> 22:42.480
Well, I already checked them. Do you like those? 
Yes. Well, we left. We left. So, I don't know how

22:50.439 --> 23:00.004
many years we lived

22:50.439 --> 23:00.004
there. I went back, my sisters, my mom, I helped her 
a lot. The years that I lasted, because I lasted

23:07.895 --> 23:15.463
little, but the years that I helped my mom, I worked 
since I was very young helping her. I understood

23:16.184 --> 23:27.156
about my sisters, about combing them, bathing 
them, ironing them, All the time my sisters were

23:27.760 --> 23:32.018
very clean. So my father said, The sewing machines 
arrived, so my father came and said, do you like the

23:36.805 --> 23:45.495
machines? The man from the machines said to me. I 
said, yes, I like them, but my father is not here

23:48.299 --> 23:54.687
right now because my mother could no longer do 
anything. So I already knew a little about sewing

23:54.707 --> 23:59.252
with the neighbor. with the neighbor. A lady had a 
machine and she told me, come sew here so I can teach

24:01.935 --> 24:06.500
you. Well, I already knew a little sewing. So she 
tells me, oh, my father is coming. Well, I'll wait

24:15.871 --> 24:17.953
for him. My father arrives and since I was the girl 
who helped him a lot, both my father and my mother,

24:26.873 --> 24:34.914
So, he tells me, his father is coming and his 
daughter wants a machine. So my father tells my

24:35.014 --> 24:42.474
mother, hey, do you want a machine? And my mother 
says, Well, no, he says, why do you want this

24:44.018 --> 24:46.441
machine? Why do you want a new machine? It costs a 
lot. He says, why don't you better buy a used one so

24:50.665 --> 24:58.834
that it can be taught? And then my father says, no. 
He says, if she wants a machine, it's better to buy

25:03.279 --> 25:09.165
her a new machine. And then I told him, I already 
know how to sew. I told him, if you want to buy me a

25:13.754 --> 25:18.428
machine, Dad, buy me a new machine. I do want a 
machine. He said, yes. Do you want the new machine?

25:23.202 --> 25:23.543
Yes. Well, my mom didn't say anything anymore 
because she said, no, it's better to buy her a new

25:24.299 --> 25:32.569
sewing machine. So I said, I already know how to 
sew. Well, then let's buy it. And then they bought

25:36.254 --> 25:39.117
me a new sewing machine. My dad didn't buy it, it 
didn't cost the machine anything more than, it

25:39.158 --> 25:44.224
seems to me, 100 pesos. It didn't cost much in those 
years of that Singer. On that machine, I didn't let

25:49.330 --> 25:54.036
my mom sew. Because we sewed by hand. We sewed 
everything by hand. My mother taught me how to sew

26:00.322 --> 26:12.244
by hand, but she wanted me to sew very well, like a 
machine. And if I didn't sew well, I did sew well. I

26:17.514 --> 26:22.223
knew I sewed well, but she didn't like it. She would 
say, sew it well again. Well, I sewed it again. I

26:27.613 --> 26:29.456
sewed it again. So when they bought that machine 
for me, I sewed for my mother, because my mother

26:33.183 --> 26:51.663
gave the clothes to sew, they charged 50 cents for 
sewing the clothes, but it was not money, because I

26:33.183 --> 26:51.663
sewed them. So they say, So I sewed everything in 
the machine, I didn't let her sew everything. I cut

26:59.345 --> 27:10.396
her dresses and sewed all her dresses

26:59.345 --> 27:10.396
in the machine. So from there we went back to the 
same place where we had been born. Because that

27:20.399 --> 27:24.304
Italian family had already left their place. They 
had already gone to another place because they

27:25.306 --> 27:29.291
were already old men. But all of these places are 
close to here, to Corpus? Yes. Yes, they are close.

27:39.985 --> 27:44.972
Yes, yes, all of these, where we have lived, yes, 
everything is close here. Yes, in the Nueces

27:44.992 --> 27:47.115
County. Yes, it's in Condado de Nueces, 
everything I'm talking about. Everything is in

27:50.138 --> 27:51.960
Condado de Nueces. Yes, yes. You never lived 
there. I didn't know anything about Robestown.

27:57.546 --> 28:02.892
No, you didn't come to California or places like 
that. Well, you know that now, since I got married,

28:02.912 --> 28:08.698
since I got married, I've been to other states. 
Yes, but in the past. Ah, not in the past, no. I've

28:13.163 --> 28:15.465
been here since my dad... Y toda nuestra familia 
aquí estuvimos, todo el tiempo aquí estuvimos,

28:15.901 --> 28:23.201
porque él nunca salió de aquí. Bueno, entonces 
volvimos a regresar para atrás. Le volvieron a dar

28:27.191 --> 28:30.400
el mismo lugar a mi papá de tierra. But then we were 
better off because we already had a truck. And then

28:38.947 --> 28:56.674
my brothers, who were my two brothers, my father, 
who is in this place where he bought the machine for

28:38.947 --> 28:56.674
me, he bought my brothers two horses, beautiful 
horses, and two Because they wanted to ride horses

28:57.008 --> 29:16.468
and they couldn't

28:57.008 --> 29:16.468
buy so

28:57.008 --> 29:16.468
many cars. But horses, yes. So my brothers, each 
one went out to walk on their horses because they

29:18.230 --> 29:26.999
lived here. They had to come here where they had 
their friends and my grandmother. So here was my

29:31.523 --> 29:33.685
grandmother and my grandmother. They would come 
on Saturdays and they would be here and they would

29:34.106 --> 29:41.173
go back until Sunday afternoon. That's why they 
wanted their horses and very good chairs. So when

29:51.760 --> 30:04.736
we came back to that place, I was 16 years old. My 
older sister was older, but she was I was with my

30:10.583 --> 30:16.811
grandmother, she had been raised with my 
grandmother, the sister who followed me. But

30:18.133 --> 30:23.440
since she was already old, she wanted to be next to 
us. Because she was not forced to be alone, just

30:23.460 --> 30:29.328
with my grandmother. And here in my house there 
were many little sisters and I was the oldest and

30:29.348 --> 30:36.237
she had never been with us. She said, I want to be 
with mom. I don't want to be with grandma anymore.

30:42.917 --> 30:46.281
But when grandma was alone, mom left her there. But 
my mom wanted her to leave and my sister didn't want

30:46.802 --> 30:50.827
to go. Poor thing, she was alone in the mountains. 
She wasn't well. She didn't want to be there. So

30:56.454 --> 31:02.882
that house was as big as this one. of the Italian 
men, of Mr. Rosas. So, that's where we lived. I

31:15.093 --> 31:31.729
think I was about six years

31:15.093 --> 31:31.729
old, six months old, when I thought of getting 
married. So, So I came back and I thought about

31:33.389 --> 31:39.163
getting married.

31:41.692 --> 31:48.520
Naturally, when you're a father, you feel bad. I 
was the first one. My father was very mortified and

31:50.722 --> 31:57.169
very hurt, but my father didn't say anything. But 
he did feel bad. The one who told my mother and the

32:02.235 --> 32:09.223
one who told my father was her. So I got married. El 
27. ¿En qué modo encontró con su esposo? Mi esposo

32:19.840 --> 32:27.139
era de...

32:19.840 --> 32:27.139
Él era de México. From Mexico? From which part? He 
was from Monterrey. Yes, his whole family was

32:31.956 --> 32:35.720
there in Monterrey. And he passed with papers to 
this side. And here he was. There he was working in

32:42.629 --> 32:43.950
that ranch too. There he taught himself to work. 
And well, in that ranch I met him. And one, I don't

32:50.018 --> 32:58.738
know, one no longer thinks, there are things that 
one doesn't think about when one is still old. And

32:58.758 --> 33:04.230
there are still things that one doesn't think 
about. In what year did your husband come to the

33:04.767 --> 33:10.533
United States? I think he came around... I think it 
was around... I'm not very sure, but I think it was

33:16.139 --> 33:23.927
around...

33:24.008 --> 33:27.531
I think he came around... around 23, 24. 23, 24. I'm 
not very sure. For what reason? For what reason did

33:31.556 --> 33:33.778
he come? Oh, well, he came for the same reasons that 
there is not much life there because the jobs are

33:34.012 --> 33:48.294
not like here. Not many have the opportunities. 
Now there are many opportunities. In those years

33:53.001 --> 33:56.627
there were not the opportunities that there are 
now. Now there are people who are very poor. Now

34:00.512 --> 34:02.737
there are people who don't have a school. Now there 
are people who don't have education. It's because

34:06.585 --> 34:11.014
they don't want it. Now they have all the 
opportunities. And Mexico too? Mexico, yes,

34:16.268 --> 34:30.472
there are also opportunities because I have been 
to Monterrey, I have been to Monterrey twice. And

34:30.492 --> 34:38.325
now that I have been alone with my children, I have 
been twice before. And I have seen that there are

34:38.710 --> 34:45.885
very poor people, but most of the people have their 
jobs, and very good jobs that many people in Mexico

34:46.287 --> 34:55.756
have. The poorest people have very good jobs to 
maintain themselves. Because they sell their

35:05.206 --> 35:12.733
things that they sell, very pretty, and any of 
those things need to be studied. And they have

35:13.557 --> 35:20.867
them, that's why they learn them, and that's why 
they make their lives. But I'm going to tell you

35:21.467 --> 35:30.119
that Mexico, as you know, I only know it because 
I've heard it and because they tell me about it. But

35:30.820 --> 35:34.144
yes, Mexico is very rich. As they say, Mexico is 
sitting in gold. But yes, What's the point of me

35:41.063 --> 35:49.354
being very rich and having the money saved here? 
You don't put it to work for the poor. You don't put

35:53.098 --> 35:55.702
it to help your own people. No. You want to have it. 
You use it a lot. You just think about being well. In

36:07.321 --> 36:09.023
having everything, only you. You have 
everything, you don't know about the others. And

36:14.789 --> 36:20.556
that's what I see, that it's not right. Because 
having your money, why don't you put it to work? So

36:27.744 --> 36:34.071
that that family doesn't suffer, the poorest one 
like you, doesn't suffer. put it to work and you

36:34.473 --> 36:39.040
will see how there is no poverty. Even if it is a 
little, like here when the United States started

36:40.422 --> 36:51.539
to pay little by little, but people knew how to 
support themselves. Well, there should have been

36:56.984 --> 37:03.931
Like those who have so much money, put them to work 
so that those poor people don't suffer. Many of

37:04.332 --> 37:12.320
those people have died, many, in these states. 
Why? Because there are many who have a lot of family

37:13.621 --> 37:20.849
and they don't have to keep them. And that's why 
they come to these places. because the money is

37:23.579 --> 37:28.087
saved there from those who have it, they don't give 
them what they lack. That's what I take badly

37:28.208 --> 37:31.915
there. And Yacina is, because I say on my part, I 
have gone a little, here to Laredo, here to Laredo,

37:31.935 --> 37:46.161
this to Monterrey, Yo tengo todo esto que no uso. Yo 
fui la otra vez. Yo llevé como cuatro o cinco

37:52.610 --> 37:56.094
paquetes. Yo los anduve repartiendo allí a esa 
gente que está de atiro pobre. Yo no lo necesito. Yo

38:03.582 --> 38:04.964
se los llevé a ellos. Porque a mí, yo no quiero tirar 
esto y tirar lo otro. Nosotros tenemos abastecido

38:11.571 --> 38:15.436
aquí, gracias a Dios. Bueno. We don't like it 
anymore. We don't like this food anymore.

38:24.425 --> 38:24.685
Everything. No, if God punishes us too. That's not 
good. If you go... Look, there are times when I have

38:28.690 --> 38:35.138
penises. I'm collecting penises, penises, 
penises. I have many penises, or nickels, or

38:37.561 --> 38:41.165
whatever. I carry many nickels in my wallet. I take 
them out with all the people I see who need nickels.

38:47.052 --> 38:47.873
I give it to them. I'm not going to be richer if I give 
a nickel and a dime. That's not going to help me. No.

38:58.474 --> 38:59.676
What I have is good. I don't envy anyone. I don't 
envy anything. Because I don't have those years. I

39:09.851 --> 39:11.093
don't envy anything. Nothing good. I go there, I 
tell you, I give away all the packages, packages,

39:13.678 --> 39:19.468
packages of clothes, of what I carry there. I give 
it to the poor people. I give the money to the poor

39:21.712 --> 39:24.677
people. That's why I carry what I carry loose to 
give away. I am here, where I can earn a nickel. Yo

39:34.799 --> 39:41.986
aquí estoy, yo hago mis costuras, yo hago mis 
delantares, yo hago horquilleros. ¿Yo puedo

39:42.006 --> 39:43.968
ganar un peso? Allá no. Esa gente no tiene, no tiene 
dinero para comprar un pedazo de material porque

39:46.231 --> 39:52.057
no lo tienen. Bueno, entonces, yo si lo tengo, 
ahorita no lo tengo, al ratito lo tengo y allá no.

39:58.804 --> 39:59.064
¿Ves? Porque ellos no tienen con qué ponerse a 
trabajar, monchos. And

40:02.828 --> 40:07.534
that's what makes a lot of money. It's like me, I'm 
doing very well here, I have everything here.

40:13.461 --> 40:16.564
Those people need a piece of bread, and I'm eating 
it. I don't need poverty, I'm not in poverty, I'm

40:17.165 --> 40:22.051
not in anything. I'm living very peacefully and 
everything. I don't know about the others. And

40:26.656 --> 40:27.958
that's what's not good. That's not good, and I'm 
not right about that. So, I got married on the 27th.

40:44.264 --> 40:47.628
I got married. Well, I got out of my house well 
because I didn't think about it. It was hard for me

40:56.129 --> 40:57.791
and all that. I thought, my mom and dad put in four 
months for me to get married. Well, I waited

41:04.361 --> 41:15.618
because I said, if they don't say yes, well, I'm 
going to stay. So,

41:15.738 --> 41:20.625
the year came, my little boy. He is now 40 years old. 
He is the oldest and he is in the service. Well, nine

41:25.897 --> 41:27.781
of my family came. There are nine of my children. 
Five men and three women.

41:39.986 --> 41:42.090
So I... The first time I went to the West, I went here 
nearby. The first time I went out, it was with my boy

41:48.295 --> 41:55.325
when he went to the service. Because my boy said, 
Mom, I'm going to go to the service. He said, he

42:00.772 --> 42:04.638
registered when he was 18 years old, which was when 
the war was. In this second war. The World War II.

42:10.165 --> 42:11.487
The World War II. Then he told me, Mom, we've never 
gone out of here. And I want us to go to Las Piscas

42:20.577 --> 42:30.889
this year, he said, because I'm going to leave next 
month. So I had my bad dad, and I had my mom and my

42:31.230 --> 42:37.137
grandparents who had died. Mi abuelito murieron 
el 37, murió mi abuelito. Y el 45 murió mi abuelita.

42:51.744 --> 42:55.069
Y el 45 mismo se fue mi muchacho al servicio. Pues 
que entonces yo,

42:57.513 --> 43:04.002
cuando yo, Cuando yo me casé, yo pensé nunca irme de 
fuera de ellos. Porque yo pensé todo el tiempo, si

43:12.258 --> 43:18.543
yo me casaba, estar todo el tiempo al lado de ellos. 
Pero entonces cuando yo, mi muchacho me dijo que me

43:19.864 --> 43:27.371
fuera, mi papá estaba malo. Y yo fui y le dije a mi 
papá que yo me iba a retirar de aquí. Y que me iba a ir.

43:36.010 --> 43:36.751
to the north. So my father says to me, well, I'm 
happy that you're leaving with your family,

43:37.712 --> 43:53.692
because I know that you're not having a good life. 
And maybe you can get a little better so that the

43:53.913 --> 44:00.261
boys can help you and you can leave. Well, I didn't 
feel very good leaving because my father was sick.

44:05.896 --> 44:16.546
But my Lord had promised me all the time that He 
would never take me out of my parents'

44:05.896 --> 44:16.546
side. But He never knew this. But that's how it was. 
He did fulfill what He told me. But because of Him, I

44:27.135 --> 44:32.600
lost my father because I never saw him again. 
Because on that trip, I lost him. But who caused it?

44:36.908 --> 44:38.771
Well, it was him. Because if he had seen the states 
with so many people at ease, I wouldn't have left

44:38.791 --> 44:45.904
this state. So we went. Thank God, we went back.

44:56.099 --> 45:00.225
I never received a telegram from my father. I never 
heard from him. Until I was on the ground, I knew

45:02.749 --> 45:06.155
that my father had died. It was impossible to come 
because they had buried him. So I went back. My son

45:17.332 --> 45:23.642
had the opportunity to go to Monterrey. to see his 
uncles, because his whole family is there. Yes.

45:30.354 --> 45:36.260
Then he said, Mom, give me money to go see my uncles. 
Yes. And he went with his cousin to Monterrey. A

45:41.766 --> 45:45.450
week passed and he came back. Then he went to the 
service. Then the second one stayed, the one who

45:49.514 --> 45:53.578
followed him. Que fue mi muchacho.
