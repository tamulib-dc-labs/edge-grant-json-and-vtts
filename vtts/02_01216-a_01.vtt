WEBVTT

00:02.883 --> 00:08.049
Dr. Vandiver, would you please tell us your name? 
Frank Everson Vandiver, born Austin, Texas,

00:08.870 --> 00:14.056
December 9, 1925. And

00:14.196 --> 00:18.201
what happened after that? 67 years passed after 
that. Your father was a professor? He was a math

00:26.230 --> 00:29.093
professor at Texas, University of Texas. and was 
on the faculty for 40 years, so I'm a faculty brat.

00:34.725 --> 00:44.840
And I took my master's degree at the University of 
Texas, have no bachelor's degree, and went on and

00:34.725 --> 00:44.840
took my PhD in history at Tulane. Who did you work 
under at Tulane? Wendell Holmes Stevens. OK,

00:50.127 --> 00:50.508
that's true. Great man. And spent some time 
teaching the summers at LSU, trying to fill in for

00:52.691 --> 00:58.860
T. Harry Williams. which was never an easy job, as 
you can well imagine. And was at Rice University

01:03.002 --> 01:07.447
for 24 years. Went to Rice in 1955 and left in really 
the end of 1979. And you taught primarily the

01:13.954 --> 01:17.518
South? South and seminars in biography and civil 
war, that sort of thing. And I also taught a

01:24.746 --> 01:28.510
freshman U.S. history course, which I greatly 
enjoyed. Which I still enjoy. I think it's a great

01:30.458 --> 01:31.439
course. Everybody ought to teach it. Each time I 
teach it, I learn more American history, don't

01:33.641 --> 01:36.283
you? You really do. It's wonderful. And that's 
where you recruit the students of the future. I

01:43.210 --> 01:50.156
shared the course every once in a while with Bill 
Masterson, who I think was the best general

01:43.210 --> 01:50.156
teacher of American history I ever saw. I was 
trying to emulate him a lot of the time. And I went in

01:55.100 --> 01:59.104
1979 to

01:59.810 --> 02:01.192
at the North Texas State University. You had 
gotten into administration at Rice. Oh, yeah,

02:03.115 --> 02:04.016
yes. I'd gotten in, despite the fact that one year I 
shared an office with Walter Prescott Webb, who

02:04.116 --> 02:16.655
had left the University of Texas and retired, and 
he came to Rice, and he kept saying, now, no matter

02:04.116 --> 02:16.655
what they tell you, don't go into administration. 
So, of course, I didn't listen to Walter Prescott

02:17.496 --> 02:21.262
Webb, and I should have. Got into administration, 
became department chairman, which I hated, and

02:21.863 --> 02:28.973
dropped that job, and In between, I got to go to 
England as the Harmsburg Professor of American

02:29.442 --> 02:43.242
History, which was a great year at Oxford, and came 
back and got stuck with being chairman again,

02:29.442 --> 02:43.242
because I wasn't there when they were selecting 
chairman. You know how that is, don't you? Yes. And

02:46.187 --> 02:57.323
then the president of Rice left, Ken Pitzer, he 
went back to Stanford as president, And I was

02:58.265 --> 03:02.129
selected as acting president of Rice University. 
Apparently, again, for the reason that nobody

03:02.929 --> 03:05.912
else would take the job. And I took the job for the- 
What year was that? 1969.

03:12.238 --> 03:15.942
And I think I took the job for a reason that a lot of 
presidents take the job. I was afraid of who else

03:16.002 --> 03:17.563
might get it. So I was acting president for 18 
months. And then Norman Hackerman came from the

03:23.489 --> 03:27.613
University of Texas. And I became Norman's 
provost at Rice and stayed in that job. Let's see, I

03:33.489 --> 03:42.678
was in that job for a year and then I went for a year to 
West Point and was professor of military history

03:33.489 --> 03:42.678
at West Point for a year, 73 to 74. Did you like that? 
I loved it. I had a wonder. It was like dying and

03:46.122 --> 03:49.545
going to heaven for a military historian. It was 
wonderful. And then came back and stayed at, as

03:56.045 --> 04:00.171
provost and finally academic vice president 
together until 1979. My wife died in late 78, and

04:02.113 --> 04:09.043
that really changed my whole attitude about 
staying at Rice. 79, excuse me. So two weeks after

04:12.267 --> 04:19.076
she died, the offer to go to North Texas came, and it 
was, at that time, a very great release for me to go.

04:20.478 --> 04:24.043
And I went and had a great year and a half. I thought 
North Texas was a wonderful place. It was just

04:27.451 --> 04:29.634
lying fallow. And it was. And it is a good school, 
you know. Yeah, I think it is, too. And I had a

04:34.199 --> 04:35.661
wonderful time there. I learned about one of the 
super music schools of the country, which is up

04:36.302 --> 04:39.786
there. It really is great. And I had a good time 
there. And to tell you how I got to A&M, I can tell you

04:43.991 --> 04:49.778
exactly the first moment I heard about it. Not 
about my original thoughts. I'll come to those in a

04:51.560 --> 04:52.461
minute. But I had gotten up early in the morning, 
and I was getting ready to go to the office in North

04:53.622 --> 04:59.730
Texas, and it was over. It was about, oh, 7 o'clock. 
It was a day like this, beautiful, clear blue sky,

05:01.272 --> 05:05.678
and sort of cool. And Renee and I were sitting in the 
living room, looking out the window at the trees

05:06.619 --> 05:11.506
and having coffee. And the phone rang, and it was 
Frank Hubert. And I wish I could tell you the date. I

05:18.976 --> 05:22.380
simply don't remember what the date was. Frank 
said, it must have been sometime in early August,

05:23.305 --> 05:31.136
maybe. But he said, I said, my God, Frank, what are 
you doing calling me at 7 o'clock in the morning? I

05:37.946 --> 05:41.210
said, are you calling to tell me the name of the new 
president of A&M? They had been debating this, and

05:41.230 --> 05:46.618
we'd read in the paper there were 200 candidates 
and all this kind of thing. And he said, well, I hope

05:47.179 --> 05:48.901
I'm talking to you. And I almost dropped the phone. 
And I said, what? and he said well the 200

05:53.157 --> 06:12.702
candidates we had all busted so he said i threw my 
hat down on the table at the board meeting and i said

05:53.157 --> 06:12.702
i'm going to give you the name of the man who ought to 
be the president and he said i think they'll

05:53.157 --> 06:12.702
probably go take my recommendation if you're 
interested Well, I said, I don't know. You've got

06:16.624 --> 06:18.126
to give me a little time to know. He said, I'm not 
going to give you any time to think. You had not even

06:19.989 --> 06:21.151
given it any thought. Not at all. I'd been reading 
what they were doing, but it never crossed my mind.

06:25.797 --> 06:31.265
And I said, well, I really am not going to tell you, 
Frank, what I think about it, but you can talk some

06:25.797 --> 06:31.265
more. Tell me about the place and what you want and 
what the situation is. Excuse me. So he said, well,

06:37.895 --> 06:40.579
we are... We need a president. We've had a 
president for a year and a half or however long it

06:42.170 --> 06:45.655
had been. It didn't work out for anybody and for him 
and for us. And I'm the chancellor, and I have the

06:50.742 --> 06:54.348
job of selecting you. And he said, if you're 
interested, I want you to go down to Dallas and meet

06:56.411 --> 07:07.027
with Bum Bright and John Blocker as soon as 
possible. They were both members of the board, as

07:07.387 --> 07:09.250
you know. So I said, well, I'll think about it. He 
said, call me back in half an hour. He did not give me

07:14.945 --> 07:16.246
much time. So I went into the living room. Renee 
said, what was that all about? I said, well, I don't

07:24.497 --> 07:30.485
know exactly what happened, but I think I was just 
offered the presidency of Texas A&M University.

07:32.047 --> 07:33.069
She said, you're joking. And I said, no, I think 
that's what happened.

07:38.609 --> 07:43.616
So the next thing I did was call Norman Hackman very 
early, right away. He was already in the office,

07:44.558 --> 07:46.621
knowing Norm. He'd been there for two hours. And I 
told Norm what had happened and what did he think.

07:51.208 --> 07:56.075
He said, well, they called me, and I suspect 
they're actually going to offer you the job. And he

07:57.457 --> 08:02.184
said, now, I didn't think you ought to go to North 
Texas because I didn't think they had any money.

08:03.365 --> 08:05.188
And there wasn't much you could do with the 
university. But A&M has part of the available

08:05.228 --> 08:07.131
fund. And something can be done there. So I think 
you ought to seriously consider going. So I called

08:13.649 --> 08:19.336
Frank back in about an hour, not half an hour, and 
said, well, I'll go down and see Bum. But I said, I

08:20.077 --> 08:25.704
can't do it right away because Renee and I are going 
to China. A group of presidents of state

08:26.926 --> 08:30.971
universities have been selected to go to China. So 
we went to China. And came back. And then I went down

08:34.876 --> 08:36.898
to see Bum. John, and I had a very interesting 
interview with them. They asked me the same

08:42.094 --> 08:46.719
question one of them said, you asked, what do you 
think about A&M? And I had thought I was probably

08:48.421 --> 08:53.487
asked that question, so I decided to be honest. I 
said, this is no time to be coy, gentlemen. You

08:57.292 --> 08:59.434
ought to really know what I think about A&M. I said, 
my daughter is in A&M at the moment, and before she

09:01.276 --> 09:07.003
went, though, I had very low opinion. I share the 
elitist view of all Rice people that no other

09:07.152 --> 09:35.995
university in the state was worth anything except 
perhaps Texas because of my own personal bias but

09:07.152 --> 09:35.995
A&M I thought was sort of a cow college and it was 
several grades above the University of Houston

09:07.152 --> 09:35.995
but not too many in my eye and I said I also have heard 
several times that the Board of Regents is

09:07.152 --> 09:35.995
impossible to work with And no president told me 
straight out. And I said, I don't think, as I

09:40.590 --> 09:44.736
understand it, nobody can survive the board. So I 
think you ought to know that I am very dubious that

09:45.497 --> 09:51.125
you and I are going to get along very well. I have a 
wonderful board at North Texas. And they said,

09:54.290 --> 09:56.092
said, how can that be? You've got 80 childs on the 
board. And I said, that's right. And I thought I'd

09:58.856 --> 10:00.859
have a lot of trouble with 80 childs. But each 
meeting, he starts off by saying, we are here. we

10:05.843 --> 10:10.770
have only one legitimate function, to hire or fire 
the president. Do I hear a motion to fire the

10:10.790 --> 10:13.774
president? He really did. And hearing no such 
motion, our only other legitimate function is to

10:15.637 --> 10:19.663
ask him how we can help him. I said, I have a 
wonderful board chairman, and I don't think I want

10:20.905 --> 10:26.393
to trade on that. And they looked a little 
surprised, but I thought they were both very nice.

10:33.763 --> 10:35.766
I was particularly impressed with John Blocker, 
who I thought all along really knew what the

10:36.792 --> 10:39.436
university was. I wasn't sure that Bum did, but I 
knew that Bum's heart was in the right place, and I

10:39.476 --> 10:45.145
could tell that from the interview. And so it went 
along very well. I was there two or three hours, two

10:49.071 --> 11:03.795
and a half hours, and they finally said, well, 
would you go up to Indianapolis and meet Art

10:49.071 --> 11:03.795
Hanson, who was then president of Purdue?

11:03.815 --> 11:04.015
Excuse me. And they said, he's going to be 
chancellor next year. This was almost a year

11:09.401 --> 11:11.324
ahead. But nobody knows him. So you go up and see 
him. So I went up and had an interview with Hanson. I

11:18.053 --> 11:19.074
liked him very much. It seemed to go very well. And 
that's how I got the job. I came back, and they

11:23.740 --> 11:25.703
offered it to me, and I took it. Had the search been 
put on hold here during that time? I'm trying to

11:29.388 --> 11:30.309
remember. I'm trying to remember. I was trying to. 
The same thing was going through my mind.

11:33.593 --> 11:37.417
Apparently, they'd run through a great number of 
candidates. And I don't know whether it was on hold

11:37.437 --> 11:40.941
or whether it was just nothing had happened. They 
just sort of sat for a while. And I said, look, you

11:44.224 --> 11:48.909
can't really offer me this job. And I can't take 
this job without visiting the university and

11:49.770 --> 11:54.855
talking to the faculty. This doesn't make sense. 
Well, that was a shock. Apparently, that hadn't

11:59.460 --> 12:01.322
been done before. So they arranged a visit for us to 
come down, Renee and me, and talk to various

12:01.977 --> 12:07.524
people. I talked to various members of what was the 
old academic program council, do you remember?

12:13.572 --> 12:16.756
And I didn't think I talked to enough faculty. I was 
talking to administrators. I kept talking to

12:18.378 --> 12:22.443
deans and people like, where is the faculty? And 
they just never showed up. There were some members

12:25.907 --> 12:28.991
of the faculty on that council, but not very many. I 
still didn't feel that I had a, a broad enough base

12:32.487 --> 12:36.012
of constituency to deal with. But that seemed to be 
what, the way they worked it here, so. I remember

12:40.999 --> 12:44.565
one engineer told me, well, why do you want to talk 
to the faculty? That sort of shook me up, you know.

12:49.572 --> 12:51.515
And so I took the job. And the, go on, pick up a 
question. Could you again comment on your

12:58.390 --> 13:12.911
perception of A&M at the time you, say, walk into 
your office, and your sense of what you would like

12:58.390 --> 13:12.911
to do or needed to be done at Texas A&M as president?

13:14.674 --> 13:22.745
By the time I took the job, I had read an awful lot of 
material about A&M, including your history, by

13:14.674 --> 13:22.745
the way, that I had not seen before. I'd read all 
kinds of material, you know, the catalog, the

13:23.266 --> 13:26.811
budget, all kinds of data, and my impression was 
this, that A&M had all the elements to be a great

13:27.348 --> 13:39.303
university. It had a good faculty. It had an uneven 
faculty, but basically a good faculty. I read all

13:47.654 --> 13:56.325
the dossiers of the faculty I could get my hands on, 
and I thought it had a fine Its greatest reputation

13:56.862 --> 13:59.865
was in engineering and agriculture. It had a 
coming reputation in science, but it hadn't made

14:01.906 --> 14:05.249
it. Its liberal arts were depressing, and they 
made me feel very bad, for obviously personal

14:07.291 --> 14:15.078
reasons. Its school of education fascinated me, 
because I had been brought up in the old attitude

14:15.798 --> 14:25.907
that schools of education were crap, and that they 
had no place on a campus of a university. Well, that

14:27.427 --> 14:36.360
was Frank Hubert's realm, and I still remember 
being shocked when they split education out of the

14:27.427 --> 14:36.360
arts and sciences and he went with education. I 
could never understand that. I know the feeling,

14:38.163 --> 14:45.374
but I was impressed as I looked at the College of 
Education with the quality of the faculty. I

14:45.434 --> 14:49.119
didn't know that you could have research in 
education, but some people were doing it. So when I

14:49.140 --> 14:54.848
got here, I knew a lot more about A&M than when I 
started. And I was... And you probably knew a lot

14:55.790 --> 15:00.677
more about A&M than a lot of A&M types. Well, 
undoubtedly, because I had really studied it. You

15:05.123 --> 15:10.890
knew a hell of a lot more, but most of the faculty 
didn't know all this about A&M. So I came with a

15:11.311 --> 15:14.315
feeling that... I looked at the available fund and 
the PUF and realized that Norm was right. There was

15:20.904 --> 15:23.287
a chance to do something here then. I think it's all 
watered down now. But then there was. And the

15:28.397 --> 15:36.949
problem, of course, was going to be, who could I put 
in the administration to help me get it done? Get

15:39.072 --> 15:40.354
what done? Get what done? What did I want to do? 
Well, the first thing that occurred to me was that

15:45.522 --> 15:55.817
the president of the university ought to have a 
vision of an institution, for it anyway, one that

15:45.522 --> 15:55.817
he He may be able to, he can articulate, but he may 
not be able to achieve, but he ought to be able to

15:55.966 --> 16:03.133
articulate a vision of the university. And I could 
tell from A&M's reputation in things like

16:03.153 --> 16:16.385
agriculture and engineering that it had an 
opportunity to be an international institution.

16:16.405 --> 16:24.252
So that's when I came up with the idea of a world 
university, not a world-class university, but a

16:16.405 --> 16:24.252
world university. And I really worked toward 
that, trying to internationalize the

16:25.362 --> 16:29.728
institution. And then I looked around at the 
administration, and you know, nobody wants to

16:30.969 --> 16:38.840
come in and shake the place up immediately. You 
want to look around and see what you got to deal

16:38.860 --> 16:41.463
with. And so I made a very careful study of all the 
colleges. I went to every college and asked the

16:48.613 --> 16:54.120
dean to give me a whole day's briefing with the 
faculty and everybody. So in a period of about six

16:54.995 --> 16:59.380
months, I knew a lot about every college. And that 
was a most revealing experience. And I knew a lot

17:04.126 --> 17:06.248
about the deans by then, too. How did the A&M 
College structure, let's say, compare or differ

17:06.268 --> 17:13.337
from the other, North Texas, Rice, et cetera? And 
this is a leading question that I have at home. It

17:16.861 --> 17:24.630
compared very similar to the North Texas college 
structure, colleges of engineering and so forth.

17:25.218 --> 17:27.962
Rice had an entirely different focus. But coming 
from North Texas, I could relate to the college

17:29.263 --> 17:37.714
structure here easily enough. Now, Rice has two 
different colleges, the residential college

17:37.734 --> 17:44.643
system and then the academic colleges. So you get 
all mixed up between the two. But I got a pretty good

17:47.487 --> 17:53.014
idea of what the institution was like. And I liked 
what I saw in the deans. I thought most of those were

17:55.735 --> 17:57.256
pretty good. Strong deans. Strong deans, yes. And 
they're essential. The provost, or the academic

18:02.462 --> 18:09.189
vice president, when I came, oh, my mind is 
leaking. You will remember. I can't help you at the

18:09.910 --> 18:12.072
moment. I was thinking. It'll come to me in a 
minute.

18:19.160 --> 18:19.560
Oh, dear. Anyway, it'll come back to me. He said 
he'd stay until the end. That's not Mac Prescott.

18:26.781 --> 18:28.003
Yes, it was Mac Prescott. And Mac said he'd stay for 
a year, but no longer. Well, I liked Mac. I thought

18:33.690 --> 18:37.254
he was damn good, and I wished he would stay home, 
but he obviously wasn't going to. He made up his

18:37.294 --> 18:38.375
mind to go. So I had to look around for an academic 
VP, and for another year, I stuck with Chuck

18:39.417 --> 18:46.365
McCandless, who was his deputy. But I was looking 
for a provost, and finally came up with... Gordon

18:52.529 --> 18:55.233
Eaton. And Gordy and I got along just fine. We were, 
we thought alike and that sort of thing. Where'd

19:01.082 --> 19:02.444
you find Gordon? In a search? Well, we had a regular 
search. That was another thing. I started

19:07.271 --> 19:11.798
searches for administrators, which shocked 
everybody, you know. I would put together a search

19:12.659 --> 19:19.549
committee with administrators and faculty 
members and consequently Obviously this was

19:19.765 --> 19:21.867
iconoclastic. People didn't do that at A&M. And 
very soon I began to worry that the APC, I think that

19:24.290 --> 19:36.665
was what it was called, wasn't the body of people 
that I needed to deal with. Those were the deans and

19:36.705 --> 19:38.487
department heads. Yeah. And you know, I needed to 
talk to the deans and department heads, but I

19:39.448 --> 19:46.296
couldn't find the faculty. My whole orientation 
was, how can you run a university if you don't know

19:46.478 --> 19:51.383
what the faculty wants to do? The faculty may have a 
view of the university you don't have. And to me,

19:56.048 --> 19:59.952
the faculty is the heart of the university. And if 
you haven't got them with you, you might as well

20:00.292 --> 20:02.695
quit. Because ultimately, they're going to 
scuttle you. But I couldn't find out who the

20:06.759 --> 20:11.344
faculty was and how to get their opinion. And very 
shortly after I got here, I got all hooked up in

20:14.643 --> 20:22.750
football crisis, as you may remember, with Tom 
Wilson and the coming of Jackie Sherrill. And that

20:23.051 --> 20:33.940
was a disaster because I really, not a disaster, 
but it was eye-opening to me because it turned out I

20:23.051 --> 20:33.940
had really nothing to do with the athletic 
program. Turns out the Board of Regents ran the

20:33.960 --> 20:36.883
athletic program. And so I had a big fight with the 
Board about that. I made a stand with Frank, and I

20:42.757 --> 21:00.896
told him that if they ran roughshod in and tried to 
put a new coach in without me being involved, I

20:42.757 --> 21:00.896
said, I know you have the veto, but if I'm not 
involved in the process, I quit. And I wrote a

21:01.877 --> 21:09.105
letter to that effect and gave it to Frank and had a 
stormy session with the board. But I said, look,

21:09.125 --> 21:11.447
you guys can't do this. I said to Bum, this is what I 
told you when I was talking to you about coming

21:11.917 --> 21:16.704
here. You are running the university, and you 
can't do that. How long after you got here was that?

21:21.951 --> 21:25.456
Do you remember? It was about, let's see, we'd been 
through one football season. I got here in

21:31.585 --> 21:32.947
September. We went through the football season, 
and it was right at the end of that. So it would have

21:36.272 --> 21:40.438
been about January, right after, yeah, January, 
February. Did you have a meeting with the faculty

21:41.903 --> 21:44.186
about that time? I did. I'd forgotten that. I'd 
forgotten that. I'd forgotten that. We all

21:48.052 --> 21:49.834
dropped our teeth about that time. But you see, my 
own feeling was, Henry, I couldn't go on as

21:49.854 --> 22:06.418
president with the faculty thinking that I had 
been all screwed up in this football business and

21:49.854 --> 22:06.418
that I just couldn't let the faculty feel. What I'm 
trying to say is I couldn't go on if the faculty

22:07.559 --> 22:11.505
didn't approve of what I had done. And there wasn't 
a faculty senate to deal with. So I called a

22:15.033 --> 22:17.856
convocation of the faculty. And that may have been 
a precedent-setting meeting. Well, I think it

22:25.386 --> 22:26.828
was. And I think the faculty weren't prepared. 
They didn't know what was going on. And all of a

22:30.652 --> 22:32.054
sudden, there he is. I think they were, as I was, but 
sort of hanging there. Well, I didn't know what

22:36.340 --> 22:37.721
else to do. It was interesting. And I had no other 
constituents to deal with. And I thought, well, if

22:42.360 --> 22:46.687
the faculty is going to say no, well, I'll quit. And 
I don't think the faculty had ever been presented

22:48.510 --> 22:53.557
with that kind of choice before. Well, and that led 
me to the faculty senate business. OK, now where

22:57.884 --> 22:59.627
did that idea come from? What was the precedent? 
Did they have it in North Texas? They had a faculty

23:02.271 --> 23:05.195
senate in North Texas. Yes, indeed. And they had a 
faculty council, it was called, at Rice, which was

23:07.696 --> 23:13.184
the same thing. But I went on here. And one day, a 
group of about three or four professors came in,

23:18.011 --> 23:23.118
led by Tom Kozik. And it was after this board, this 
meeting, that I called.

23:30.729 --> 23:33.352
And he said, well, you know, this meeting you 
called was very interesting. It reminded me of a

23:34.013 --> 23:37.298
plan. several of us came up with several years ago 
to try to push a faculty senate, which he said did

23:37.632 --> 23:45.842
not get very far. And he said, since you seem to want 
faculty opinion, how do you feel about a faculty

23:46.583 --> 23:53.031
senate? And I said, boy, I am all for it. So he said, 
here. He dusted off an old plan, literally, and

23:56.836 --> 24:00.360
handed it to me. And he said, can you start with 
this? So you know what happened? I created a

24:04.785 --> 24:07.048
committee to look into the faculty senate. Claude 
Davis was the chairman, who did a great job. The

24:12.384 --> 24:14.246
committee did a wonderful job. They had a hell of a 
time, too. They worked very hard. Worked very hard

24:16.208 --> 24:18.351
on it. And they had a lot of resistance. God 
almighty, you know. That has changed. I couldn't

24:23.657 --> 24:24.759
believe it. I just couldn't believe it. The 
engineering school came to pieces. Veterinary

24:28.723 --> 24:31.146
medicine blew up, you know. How could you do 
something like this? We haven't done it this way

24:33.792 --> 24:35.954
before. So

24:36.215 --> 24:40.780
I was very proud of that. I think they did a 
wonderful job. And as you know, we turned over all

24:43.183 --> 24:52.053
the functions of the old ABC to the Senate, course 
approval and all that sort of thing. And I think

24:52.193 --> 24:53.675
they've done a great job. OK, let me ask you about 
the faculty senate. Do you think, how has that

24:55.297 --> 25:03.546
impacted, let's say, on the quality and the 
character of the university? Well, I'm probably

25:04.066 --> 25:07.649
not the best one to ask that. You ought to ask the 
faculty, I guess. But what I think, let me give you

25:09.931 --> 25:14.815
my impression.

25:15.856 --> 25:22.042
Remember, I'll give you a biased impression 
because I was so much in favor of the Senate.

25:24.384 --> 25:32.571
I thought all along that the university, if it was 
going to become a first-class institution,

25:34.019 --> 25:43.748
couldn't get there with, you couldn't hire the 
right kind of faculty if you didn't get into the

25:34.019 --> 25:43.748
20th century administratively. You know, you 
talk to good faculty everywhere, and they always

25:43.788 --> 25:50.955
ask about faculty representation, faculty 
governance, and all this kind of thing. So I

25:50.975 --> 25:56.040
thought the Senate was essential for recruiting 
faculty. I thought it was essential, too, as an

25:57.121 --> 26:01.866
organization through which the administration 
could make its plans known, and could ask advice

26:02.538 --> 26:09.064
and help of the faculty. I really saw the Senate as a 
two-way street. Did it work that way? It did work

26:13.568 --> 26:14.549
that way. Not always, but essentially. And I told 
that committee that was making up, creating the

26:16.931 --> 26:29.743
Senate at their last meeting, I said, look, when 
this Senate is going, the first time I say to

26:16.931 --> 26:29.743
myself, Jesus Christ, why did I do this? You are a 
success. And it took about a year, but then I

26:32.744 --> 26:37.911
started saying it frequently. Yes, yes. And I 
meant that, and I think that's true. Do you think

26:43.959 --> 26:48.524
there was a tangible result in better recruiting? 
Did you sense that? I think so. I think so. A lot of

26:52.770 --> 26:57.917
the fact, I always sat in on recruiting a full 
professor. I couldn't do it further down, and I

26:58.437 --> 27:01.862
didn't think it was really my business. Sure. But I 
thought full professors... You did interview the

27:02.478 --> 27:04.681
full professors? Yes, I thought I ought to look at 
those. And several of them would say, do you have a

27:07.824 --> 27:12.730
faculty center? And I think that was very 
important. And through the Senate, for instance,

27:15.734 --> 27:26.527
we worked on, Gordy and I worked on getting the core 
curriculum approved. And I wrote to the Senate and

27:26.647 --> 27:29.751
suggested they look at the core curriculum. And lo 
and behold, I think they came up with a fine core

27:30.389 --> 27:33.354
curriculum. And they did it. I was really proud of 
that. I think one of the main achievements of my

27:39.723 --> 27:45.131
administration was the faculty senate. I was 
going to say, I assume that. Yeah. What about the

27:49.478 --> 27:58.231
academic recasting or redirection or thrusting 
that you were trying to achieve as president?

27:58.251 --> 27:59.333
Where were you trying to work? I was trying to work 
at... Or does a president really have a capability

28:00.190 --> 28:09.298
to sit there and shape those kind of things very... 
You can think about it. You can think about it. But

28:10.279 --> 28:14.403
you can't do them until the opportunity comes. I 
wanted very strong leadership in two areas where

28:14.423 --> 28:22.950
we had a real problem. You will recall that 
agriculture and engineering had gotten into a

28:22.970 --> 28:29.556
serious split of authority The dean, for 
instance, the dean of agriculture had almost no

28:30.599 --> 28:36.466
authority. He was the academic dean, but he didn't 
have any research money. Remember, it all went off

28:40.271 --> 28:44.336
to the experiment station. And my big problem, I 
was trying to think very early on how you get it back

28:44.356 --> 28:53.947
together. The experiment stations and the 
engineering experiment stations had been

28:59.405 --> 29:02.469
siphoned off to the system, you may remember. 
Well, how can you bifurcate the College of

29:03.811 --> 29:09.419
Engineering and Agriculture that way? It 
emasculates the university side, and it creates a

29:10.100 --> 29:18.051
monster from the standpoint of the research side. 
If you were a professor of agriculture, and you

29:18.071 --> 29:29.226
also had a joint appointment in the experiment 
station, which you would if you wanted to do

29:18.071 --> 29:29.226
research, where did your loyalty lie? It was with 
the man who had the money. And so it was a terrible

29:33.819 --> 29:35.241
mess. And the only solution, the obvious one I 
wanted to achieve, was to get it back to the

29:36.943 --> 29:47.855
university and have the system say a flag on it and 
take it back. Well, Frank wasn't about to do that

29:48.176 --> 29:56.185
because he'd fought the whole battle of trying to 
get it saved in the first place. It was old history.

29:58.167 --> 29:58.808
You know about that. Hanson

29:59.463 --> 30:10.633
knew where it ought to be in the university, but he 
didn't want to give it up. Sure, that's right. And I

30:11.934 --> 30:13.355
could see that happening. And I kept saying, Art, 
you know where it ought to be in the university. Oh,

30:17.199 --> 30:21.182
I know, I know, but it's just going to take a little 
while to get this done. So what we did was come up

30:21.202 --> 30:27.428
with this sort of curious two-hatted creature The 
first one was Donald McDonald, who you remember

30:28.555 --> 30:46.396
was a professor of engineering, and we made him, 
got Art to agree to this, made him dean of

30:28.555 --> 30:46.396
engineering and deputy chancellor for 
engineering. He was acting in both capacities. So

30:49.479 --> 30:55.686
he had two hats, but it gave him what amounted to the 
power of one office. And that worked. So we worked

30:57.462 --> 31:02.608
that in agriculture.

31:03.349 --> 31:08.554
Perry, got Perry to do that. And that, I think, was 
an ingenious dodge that worked. And then the

31:16.523 --> 31:20.247
problem was to get the right person. Donald didn't 
want to keep it. Donald, you know, he took a hell of a

31:22.470 --> 31:26.314
beating in that job. It was terrible. because the 
faculty didn't understand it and the faculty

31:28.090 --> 31:31.453
didn't want it. There was a lot of contention. You 
remember. You remember. It was really a mess. And

31:34.315 --> 31:36.777
then everybody thought Nichols were at stake, 
too. Oh, yeah. Yeah. They sure were. Yeah. And it

31:40.180 --> 31:41.962
was a mess. And he took a real pounding. I thought he 
ought to wear a flak jacket every day over at the

31:45.004 --> 31:49.848
engineering school. So the problem was to get the 
right people. And that's where the faculty senate

31:52.611 --> 31:57.675
helped, because we had one.

31:58.297 --> 32:07.926
Gordy and I put together a search committee to look 
for both a dean and vice chancellor of engineering

31:58.297 --> 32:07.926
and of agriculture. And we had a hell of a time 
recruiting Herb Richardson, but we did it. Herb

32:13.751 --> 32:17.194
was dean of engineering, you know, at MIT. And it 
turns out that he was actually slated to be

32:17.755 --> 32:20.377
president. But I think the thing that saved us was 
he didn't know that. And we didn't either. Have you

32:25.041 --> 32:25.862
ever told him that? No. And so it was sort of like a 
soap opera. Every week we would wonder how we were

32:33.823 --> 32:37.028
doing in recruiting Herb Richardson. We'd have 
him and then we wouldn't have him. It's like

32:38.850 --> 32:40.393
landing a great big fish. And Gordy and I both knew 
that. We knew that if we could land Herb

32:43.317 --> 32:50.869
Richardson, steal the dean of engineering from 
MIT, we had made it. A&M had made it. And it was vital

32:53.734 --> 32:55.236
that we get him. So then we went to get Charlie 
Arnson for agriculture, and he was with, oh,

32:58.034 --> 33:07.789
what's that big company that he came from?

33:10.774 --> 33:12.116
He was their research director. It's a big ag 
corporation, and I can't think of the name.

33:16.403 --> 33:23.454
Anyway, but again, he was a member of the National 
Academy of Sciences, and Herb was a member of the

33:16.403 --> 33:23.454
National Academy of Engineering. That's the kind 
of quality we were looking for. And getting them

33:26.367 --> 33:30.191
both was a big moment. And to me, it represented the 
arrival of Texas A&M on the national scene. Good.

33:36.358 --> 33:41.204
Now, how are you and Hanson collaborating or not? 
Very well. Very well. Art's problem, and I say this

33:43.927 --> 33:52.577
with affection because I like Art, was he could 
never make a decision. Gordy came back from some

33:54.869 --> 34:01.458
meeting after we had been announced he was coming 
here, and he'd run into somebody from Georgia

33:54.869 --> 34:01.458
Tech. You know, he'd been at Georgia Tech before, 
Hanson had. And he said, the man looked at him and

34:04.061 --> 34:07.185
said, has Art made a decision yet?

34:10.129 --> 34:10.730
And that was true. That was true. But he was, Hanson 
knew what a university ought to be, and that's what

34:11.771 --> 34:16.497
counted. So when you'd go in and you'd tell him, 
look, we're trying to recruit somebody like Herb

34:17.539 --> 34:23.306
Richardson, he understood that. Now, where is the 
board? right now in all of this? The board was very

34:28.004 --> 34:30.728
supportive of this kind of thing. As long as you and 
Hansen were basically together and presented a

34:31.949 --> 34:35.374
united front. Yeah, yeah. One of the board 
members, Dooley Bell, whose name you may

34:37.216 --> 34:50.813
remember, told me one time, I'd been telling the 
board that one of my objectives was to get either

34:37.216 --> 34:50.813
raised internally or hire a Nobel laureate. 
because I thought that a great research

34:52.177 --> 34:57.942
university wasn't one unless it could recruit at 
that level. And he told me one day, he says, by God,

34:59.423 --> 35:09.192
you better recruit that Nobel laureate fast, 
because people are getting mad at the way you're

34:59.423 --> 35:09.192
recruiting all these highfalutin faculty 
members. But that made me feel good. That meant the

35:10.694 --> 35:13.676
board was concerned and knew what I was trying to 
do. Now, they might not like it, but they

35:13.977 --> 35:15.998
understood it. And Hanson understood it, and he 
explained it to them, what we were trying to do. So

35:21.539 --> 35:30.352
we got those two, and then I went after... Is Bum 
still... Bum is still chairman of the board. Then

35:30.372 --> 35:37.242
one day Perry called, and he said, how much do you 
really want to recruit a Nobel laureate? I said,

35:38.063 --> 35:39.385
pretty much, Perry. He said, well, I think we have a 
shot at Norman Borlaug. And oh my God, that was...

35:45.674 --> 35:49.960
Then we got Norman, as you know, And that was 
another great step forward. Then we got Derek

35:52.265 --> 35:57.510
Barton in chemistry. And that was another great 
shot in the arm for us. And you know, my feeling was

36:02.775 --> 36:10.663
that if you could recruit at that level, Henry, you 
didn't have to worry about being a national

36:02.775 --> 36:10.663
institution anymore. Right. Or a world. That's 
right. People knew you. That's right. And you

36:14.447 --> 36:18.951
know, we recruited a wonderful black playwright 
who was a Pulitzer Prize winner. Then we began to

36:21.756 --> 36:24.539
hit that kind of stride. These are sort of 
tangential questions, I guess. What's your

36:29.085 --> 36:34.551
relationship, let's say, with the former 
Students' Organization about this time? Is there

36:34.571 --> 36:40.799
any collaboration, association, friction, et 
cetera? All of the above. All of the above. A lot of

36:45.464 --> 36:46.245
change. A lot of change on the campus. Many old eggs 
were not at all sure that this was the right way to

36:49.880 --> 36:54.807
go. Again, we hadn't done it this way before. And I 
was emphasizing things a lot of them didn't really

37:00.314 --> 37:05.281
think they wanted at A&M. There was enough trouble 
over women, but that was still bubbling. But this

37:12.351 --> 37:18.199
big business about recruiting all this 
high-powered faculty and talking about world

37:18.517 --> 37:47.528
universities and research all the time we ought to 
be here teaching agriculture you know and

37:18.517 --> 37:47.528
engineering that was a it was a problem and i had to i 
went before the a meeting of the one of their annual

37:18.517 --> 37:47.528
meetings they have here and explained what i was 
trying to do just told them straight up and i said

37:18.517 --> 37:47.528
look my favorite line i used it whenever i could 
talk to the alumni look if this place is just like it

37:18.517 --> 37:47.528
was when you were here everybody's failed 
Everybody's fizzled from the beginning to the

37:48.352 --> 37:51.616
end.

37:54.799 --> 37:58.283
And I said, you shouldn't be sitting out there and 
wanting it to be just the way it was. Don't come to me

37:59.244 --> 38:00.585
and tell me that. You don't impress me with that 
line. And it really shook them up, you know. But

38:05.871 --> 38:06.892
it's true, Henry. Again,

38:09.375 --> 38:18.004
on the former students, do you think they, from 
your other university experiences, are really a

38:09.375 --> 38:18.004
unique Oh, yes. They are. And they have, they 
have... Are they a blessing to the university?

38:26.005 --> 38:30.151
They can be both a blessing and a curse, because 
they have tremendous power. They have real power

38:30.892 --> 38:38.183
with the board, because the board, up until 
recently, has been essentially them,

38:30.892 --> 38:38.183
represented them. One board member, I always 
thought, he was at one time president of the former

38:38.203 --> 38:47.097
students, and He was a politician, his 
profession. So I right away figured out what he was

38:50.950 --> 38:53.873
doing. He was looking for his constituency, and he 
represented the students perfectly. Then he got

38:57.877 --> 39:04.403
on the board, and I was hoping he would switch and 
his constituency would be the university, but he

38:57.877 --> 39:04.403
never made that switch. So the board, since it so 
often comes from the former students, can also be a

39:06.105 --> 39:16.915
problem because they're reflecting what they 
hear out among the former students. troops but and

39:17.333 --> 39:42.936
there also can be a great help because i when i was 
trying for instance to fight the budget crunch in

39:17.333 --> 39:42.936
austin in 85 84 and 85 when we first got the turn down 
what were the total years in here 81 to 88 um

39:17.333 --> 39:42.936
i got great help from the board and i got great help 
from the the aggie mom yeah wonderful group just

39:43.608 --> 40:12.585
wonderful and they would they'd go to austin 
they'd talk to everybody you know on the board the

39:43.608 --> 40:12.585
former students would do that too i'd often tell 
the moms had more clout than the purpose well i

39:43.608 --> 40:12.585
always thought that the moms were the best asset 
that i could count on i used them all the time for

39:43.608 --> 40:12.585
politic direct political health and got it and 
they were tickled because nobody had used them

39:43.608 --> 40:12.585
that way before and they really liked that what 
about uh I

40:13.274 --> 40:22.588
was about to come to that, because shortly, my mind 
is vague on the dates, Henry. As a historian it

40:23.008 --> 40:25.011
shouldn't be, but it is. I

40:25.171 --> 40:29.458
don't know. It's a good thing we're not 
journalists.

40:34.485 --> 40:39.332
It must have been about 82.

40:42.282 --> 40:49.209
that a

40:42.282 --> 40:49.209
group of faculty came to see me.

40:52.032 --> 40:55.716
Oh, what's that lady's name? Wonderful faculty 
member. Sociology? Yes. You know who I'm talking

41:01.963 --> 41:04.505
about. Oh, yeah. She was wonderful. She came with a 
group. cox not not uh no no um schaefer yeah ruth

41:07.291 --> 41:31.543
ruth came to me yeah with a group and uh i remember 
she came to me about this time when i was department

41:07.291 --> 41:31.543
head yeah well she you know i didn't know whether to 
throw her out or listen to her at the time well you

41:07.291 --> 41:31.543
know she came and blasted at me you know how ruth can 
be and i sort of sat back and i thought she was my

41:07.291 --> 41:31.543
friend yeah And it suddenly dawned on me as I 
listened that this lady was raising my

41:31.658 --> 41:38.705
consciousness in the old terminology, and she 
really was. So I said, okay, are you going to put

41:39.406 --> 41:43.150
your money where your mouth is? I'll create a 
committee to look into minority affairs, but you

41:44.031 --> 41:47.655
have to run it. She said, all right. So she, you 
know, they put together a report, which was an

41:51.739 --> 41:58.746
excellent document, and it was going to cost, the 
program for minority recruiting of both students

41:58.979 --> 42:04.926
and faculty was going to cost $4 million.

42:07.689 --> 42:11.713
And I said, all right, I will take this to the board. 
And boy, did I run into a big fat puzzle. Big fat

42:15.898 --> 42:18.761
problem. One board member says, you goddamn 
liberal Democrat, you're trying to change the

42:18.781 --> 42:24.508
university. I said, that's right. Not because I'm 
a liberal Democrat, but because the university

42:26.755 --> 42:30.360
needs changing. And that made him mad. But they, 
with Art Hanson helping, and with Bum also

42:32.543 --> 42:46.683
helping,

42:32.543 --> 42:46.683
you know, Bum was an odd character in many ways. 
I'll talk about Bum separately. The board finally

42:50.108 --> 42:54.394
bit the bullet and appropriated the money. How did 
you persuade them? Well, it took two or three

42:55.544 --> 43:02.871
different meetings, and it took a lot of meeting 
upstairs in the regent's quarters. I was greatly

43:03.992 --> 43:12.119
helped by John Coleman, the black regent from 
Houston. He was, I always thought, the one regent

43:14.041 --> 43:18.224
who knew what a university was. I'll tell you 
another story about him later.

43:23.089 --> 43:24.370
And Royce Weisenbaker,

43:28.130 --> 43:33.357
And

43:28.130 --> 43:33.357
Clyde Well. Remember Clyde? Oh, yeah, I remember 
him real well. They all... He was on the board when

43:39.265 --> 43:40.687
Rudder was here. Yeah, he was on the board 24 years. 
All of these people, and there were one or two

43:44.893 --> 43:47.657
others I can't remember. All the allies I was 
counting on. I was sort of operating like Lyndon,

43:51.963 --> 43:55.808
trying to count the votes with each meeting. But 
this group And Norman Mosier, Norman Mosier,

43:58.319 --> 44:06.667
would all put it this way. Well, we don't like to do 
this, but it has to be done. So they voted the $4

44:11.852 --> 44:13.614
million. But then they said, okay, you're stuck 
with it. You have to make something happen. So then

44:19.539 --> 44:24.664
I went back to Ruth in the committee, and I said, 
okay, now you're stuck with it. Be careful what you

44:25.218 --> 44:26.539
pray for. You've got it. Now make something 
happen. And it did. It did. It did. Never, I guess,

44:33.406 --> 44:35.988
to satisfy enough people. No, but she said the 
first thing we have to do is have some edict from

44:36.008 --> 44:41.133
your office that this is important. I created 
extra jobs in departments for minority

44:41.273 --> 44:45.957
recruiting. And I think it was a great step 
forward. And we did very well in recruiting

44:48.539 --> 44:54.205
students, but we were way behind in the pack. I 
said, look, I told Ruth, I said, now, you're going

44:55.103 --> 45:04.393
to be impatient, and you ought to be, but you've got 
to remember, if we get one, we're 100% better than

44:55.103 --> 45:04.393
we were yesterday. Another question, I guess, 
relating to minority recruitment students. What

45:10.039 --> 45:15.425
about the Corps of Cadets during these years? How 
were they deferring, and were you having

45:15.445 --> 45:20.270
problems? The Corps was doing very well. The old 
system, in effect, when I was here, it wasn't

45:23.133 --> 45:40.617
necessarily that old, was that there was a senior 
professor of military science who ran the Corps,

45:23.133 --> 45:40.617
but also was a professor of whatever, air or, you 
know, Army or Navy. We then had the case of Mr.

45:42.379 --> 45:50.170
Goodrich, whom you may remember, the cadet who 
died, was killed by over... work, remember? Yes, I

45:52.062 --> 45:53.924
sure did. And I think this was the thing that 
triggered it. There may have been an earlier

45:56.207 --> 45:57.709
episode. Well, it was shortly after I got here 
during the SMU game, there was the case of the

45:58.109 --> 46:03.215
Sabre. Oh, you were here for that, too. Oh, I was 
here for that, too. That was my second football

46:06.419 --> 46:08.682
game. That was a great moment. And I had to write the 
president of SMU a letter of apology, which

46:11.044 --> 46:19.414
infuriated the Corps of Cadets that I would 
apologize. And I had a meeting with the Corps, and I

46:20.035 --> 46:30.527
said, look, I said, you know, you're supposed to be 
officers, not necessarily gentlemen. But

46:32.129 --> 46:36.975
officers conduct themselves with probity in a 
moment of crisis. That's why you're an officer.

46:40.098 --> 46:42.801
And if you can't act that way, you don't need to be an 
officer. You should be busted. Yeah, I would have

46:45.382 --> 46:50.690
thought you had more understanding and 
compassion for the Corps than many Presidents.

46:50.710 --> 46:52.493
Yes, but I think that point was quite right. But the 
case of Goodrich convinced me that there was real

46:52.573 --> 46:59.644
trouble in the Corps that I didn't know about. 
Neither did Coldress, who had only a tenuous

47:00.966 --> 47:04.652
connection. You know, the Corps has always had the 
strange rule of the organization which allows

47:04.832 --> 47:12.925
them to manage themselves. And I don't think 
that's a way to run a Corps. A Corps can't manage

47:15.311 --> 47:17.768
itself.
