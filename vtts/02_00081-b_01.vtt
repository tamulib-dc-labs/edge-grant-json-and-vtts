WEBVTT

00:02.613 --> 00:08.982
international students, and you said Saudi 
Arabia students were not quite as good. Well, it

00:09.543 --> 00:15.231
depended on where they were, you know, what their 
status was in the society. The ones who were in a

00:15.812 --> 00:19.297
high status, they felt that they didn't have to do 
anything. Everybody had to do everything for

00:19.357 --> 00:26.747
them, even including their research work, and 
other ones were very hardworking. They were

00:26.727 --> 00:29.013
generally fairly intelligent. The ones that we 
had from Turkey would work very hard, but their

00:29.895 --> 00:38.577
quality seemed to be a lot lower, even than the 
Saudi Arabia. More often than not, did these

00:39.164 --> 00:43.411
students come with an undergraduate degree? Yes. 
They came as graduate students? Correct. Where

00:46.455 --> 00:48.439
had they done their undergraduate degree? Mostly 
in the national universities. In their country?

00:52.505 --> 00:53.226
In their own country. In terms of their family 
backgrounds, were they by and large from families

00:53.527 --> 01:03.282
that had the parents had a college degree? I don't 
remember whether they did or not. I suspect they

01:08.850 --> 01:21.516
did, but they came from families that were better 
off, well off, relatively well off, and also who

01:08.850 --> 01:21.516
were interested in education, as you might 
expect, because they did have to sort of pay for

01:08.850 --> 01:21.516
their coming over here. They would not be what we 
would call peasant families. No. Definitely not.

01:27.008 --> 01:37.690
Did ever have any that you can remember who were 
from very well-to-do and or families with royal

01:27.008 --> 01:37.690
blood? Did you all ever have any of those? I'm not 
sure we had any with royal blood, but we did have

01:40.397 --> 01:48.668
some that were well-to-do, that looked like they 
had more money and they knew what to do with. And

01:48.968 --> 02:02.226
especially that Saudi Arabian student in 
particular, I think he had from a well-to-do

01:48.968 --> 02:02.226
family, which was indicative of his work ethic. 
Now, I remember in the late 70s when I was dean of

02:02.695 --> 02:15.156
faculties, we worked with the Saudi Arabian 
government to make a kind of a package deal in a

02:02.695 --> 02:15.156
number of departments. Did you all ever have a kind 
of a contract with any nation or any government

02:15.176 --> 02:23.370
about that? Not in the beginning. It may have in the 
recent past. There may have been some. And with

02:30.396 --> 02:32.139
Saudi Arabia. I think when Terry Spencer and Joel 
Watkins set up the petroleum geology or petroleum

02:32.219 --> 02:46.523
geophysics program, I think they may have set up 
something with China and with Saudi Arabia. Right

02:47.178 --> 02:53.347
now, back in the 70s, President Williams is 
followed by Jarvis Miller. Did his presidency

02:54.448 --> 02:57.953
have any impact on y'all? No. Right. Then Frank 
Vandiver. Right. Any presidents coming through

03:01.879 --> 03:11.312
the 80s and 90s that you recall having a direct 
impact on how y'all did things? No, they didn't do

03:11.427 --> 03:12.929
anything bad. They didn't do anything good. We 
were sort of off in our own little corner, and I

03:14.171 --> 03:20.061
don't think they helped us or hurt us. All right, 
trace on through then the department heads in

03:20.201 --> 03:25.690
geophysics. Well, let's see. After Earl Hoskins, 
then I got Joel Watkins, I believe. And after Joel,

03:33.822 --> 03:37.829
why, now we've got Andy Hash. How long has he been 
here? Andy was an undergraduate, a graduate

03:39.642 --> 03:48.392
student here, so he's been here since the 70s. Did 
he stay? He never left? That's right, he never

03:52.937 --> 03:53.998
left. My goodness. So he did all his degrees here. 
Well, I'm not sure he did the undergraduate

03:57.843 --> 04:00.305
degree. He certainly did the graduate degree. It 
was in geology, not in geophysics. All right, then

04:04.702 --> 04:07.495
the deans. What about the deans that made a 
difference? Well, I think the only one, well,

04:12.076 --> 04:14.720
let's see. Mel Friedman made somewhat of a 
difference because there was a time when things

04:14.980 --> 04:20.409
were tough in the oil business. And Mel got kind of 
hustling around with the Department of Energy to

04:20.829 --> 04:30.264
kind of get us into that program to try to improve 
matters there. We got into the nuclear waste

04:30.644 --> 04:35.552
isolation and stuff like that. I remember Gordy 
Eaton, who preceded Mell, was a very effective

04:35.988 --> 04:53.772
dean, because he was such a good organizer and 
operator and personable and so forth, and seemed

04:35.988 --> 04:53.772
to do a very nice job. His interaction with the 
department wasn't quite as much as it was as Mell,

04:55.074 --> 05:03.345
because Mell had already been in the department. 
And so he already knew who the department was. And

05:06.396 --> 05:07.720
so we got along quite well. He had an impact. And 
after him, after Mel, I guess, was Deuce. I

05:14.429 --> 05:17.292
believe, and after Deuce is Pryor. I think those 
guys have done about as much as the presidents have

05:19.193 --> 05:22.936
done. They just didn't make any difference. In 
terms of the college, oceanography,

05:27.300 --> 05:42.934
meteorology, geology, geophysics, and 
geography, has the college down through your

05:27.300 --> 05:42.934
30-some odd years seemed to pull together 
reasonably well? No, I really don't think so. As a

05:47.310 --> 05:56.085
matter of fact, I think one of the really dumbest 
moves that was ever made was that they built the

05:47.310 --> 05:56.085
oceanography and meteorology building so far 
away from this building. And so consequently,

05:56.506 --> 06:05.361
there's been very little interaction between 
meteorology and geophysics, or oceanography and

05:56.506 --> 06:05.361
geophysics. and between geography and 
geophysics. Well, geography maybe is not so bad.

06:10.469 --> 06:14.695
Maybe there doesn't should be, or there isn't much 
reason to have much interaction. But there hasn't

06:15.095 --> 06:16.377
been any with that. So no, I don't think it's really 
pulled together. I think it's the lack of

06:20.243 --> 06:26.472
propinquity that's caused the real problem. And I 
think it's a bad move, whoever decided to do that.

06:30.680 --> 06:37.113
And I think they did that because they wanted that 
stupid weather radar on the top of the thing there,

06:30.680 --> 06:37.113
and they were afraid of this water tower. But that 
was a bad move. Also, going to a tall building is a

06:40.139 --> 06:42.344
bad move. I was at MIT when they did the I.M. Pei 
building, the green building there. And it was a

06:47.208 --> 06:50.215
very small base and very tall. You got almost no 
communication from one floor to the next. It's

06:54.765 --> 06:57.231
almost like the laws of physics are here. The 
greater the potential, the less the interaction.

07:00.719 --> 07:04.407
It's inversely proportional to the distance and 
the height. And interaction between the faculty

07:04.387 --> 07:10.214
is a very important and crucial thing. This 
building is great because it's long, very long,

07:10.534 --> 07:19.244
and only three stories high or so, and that's the 
way it should be. I'm nodding my head in agreement

07:19.784 --> 07:27.173
because I believe that we human beings don't move 
vertically nearly as well as we move

07:19.784 --> 07:27.173
horizontally. Correct. uh... university of 
texas library towers uh... notable example of

07:28.467 --> 07:44.130
that uh... the uh... washington monument is a good 
visual symbol but that's all yeah that's all Do you

07:44.110 --> 07:58.950
recall, looking back over these 30 years, do you 
recall when

07:44.110 --> 07:58.950
the department and or the college might have gone 
after some research grant or some project that it

07:44.110 --> 07:58.950
didn't? That it didn't get? Was there some 
opportunity that either it tried and failed or

08:01.773 --> 08:08.262
didn't even make an effort?

08:11.009 --> 08:15.914
Well, we went after a lot of things, and we tried. 
Some we were successful, some we failed. But I

08:18.217 --> 08:24.784
don't think there was anything that was so 
traumatic that it knocked us to our knees or

08:18.217 --> 08:24.784
anything like that. We could have done better than 
we did do in terms of getting research work. I don't

08:32.172 --> 08:36.257
think we went after as much as we should have. Can 
you think of some geophysics

08:36.710 --> 08:56.052
research accomplishment when that really began 
to put this department on the map, began to clearly

08:36.710 --> 08:56.052
demonstrate it was playing in the big leagues?

08:57.618 --> 08:58.620
That's a good question.

09:02.006 --> 09:05.171
That's tough to answer, because the only ones I can 
think of are the ones that I did. And I'm not sure

09:05.472 --> 09:07.074
that's fair to say that. No,

09:07.114 --> 09:14.868
I really can't think of anything. Well, I guess 
maybe the SALT project, the nuclear waste

09:14.908 --> 09:22.461
project. and nuclear isolation in the SALT 
project, which was partly in this department and

09:22.441 --> 09:31.330
also in geology in the Center for Tectonal 
Physics. But the Center for Tectonal Physics

09:32.331 --> 09:35.274
always was a very important part. I think the 
Center for Tectonal Physics put this department

09:35.334 --> 09:49.528
on the map, or this college or this group on the map, 
because of the many diverse things that they did

09:35.334 --> 09:49.528
and useful things that they did. Which ones in 
particular specifically? I can't think of all of

09:53.274 --> 09:54.656
them. Are there some national rankings, national 
listings of the top five or ten geophysics? Are

10:05.594 --> 10:07.517
those ever done? I think they are. I don't know what 
our rank is. You don't know where? We've never been

10:13.947 --> 10:17.512
in the top five. But we would be, if someone asked us 
where we big league, we'd claim that, wouldn't we?

10:25.023 --> 10:26.426
Yeah, right. But second tier. Top ten? Top ten, 
probably. Certainly top 20, yeah. The

10:35.813 --> 10:47.992
involvement with industry, is it today about what 
it used to be? What are the current trends in

10:48.072 --> 10:58.868
research and job placement today? Actually, I 
think the involvement in research is even more

10:58.848 --> 11:12.786
today than it was in the past, mostly because the 
oil companies themselves have gotten rid of their

10:58.848 --> 11:12.786
research departments and so therefore they're 
doing a lot of stuff outside with the

10:58.848 --> 11:12.786
universities, with consortia. So in that sense, I 
think it's increased. However, the oil companies

11:16.531 --> 11:18.493
have Their total effort has gone down all the way 
along the line. They seem to be pulling in their

11:22.519 --> 11:24.161
ears. The oil companies are being run more by 
businessmen than they are by engineers or

11:24.221 --> 11:38.202
geologists or people who are interested in the 
business. There seems to be less interest in the

11:38.222 --> 11:47.856
actual nuts and bolts of the business and more 
interest in how much money can they make and so

11:38.222 --> 11:47.856
forth. I think the oil companies, if they're not 
careful, are going to cause their own destruction

11:48.359 --> 11:54.769
by that attitude.

11:58.013 --> 12:04.002
With the mergers and so forth, they've cut back on 
the scholarships they've given us, as far as I

11:58.013 --> 12:04.002
know. I don't really know, though. The department 
head would have to tell you that. But my impression

12:07.107 --> 12:13.236
is that there's much less.

12:13.368 --> 12:16.171
Well, then I guess we've dropped the ball a good 
bit, too. There was a time when we would have almost

12:16.231 --> 12:23.960
one half of all the scholarships that were given by 
the Society of Exploration Geophysicists. I

12:23.980 --> 12:26.163
don't think we have one or two of them now. And that 
was at a time when they would give out 10 or 20. And

12:31.068 --> 12:35.173
now they're giving out 30 or 40, and we don't have 
but maybe one or two. And I think that's our fault,

12:35.153 --> 12:40.219
not going after these, number one. Number two, not 
having the quality of students that we used to have

12:40.479 --> 12:44.343
in the past. But it really was people working at it. 
Now, as the female enrollment here grew, did women

12:48.367 --> 12:59.139
coming to take courses in geophysics cause any 
changes in the way you all did things? No. Do you

13:02.322 --> 13:15.143
remember any kind of awkward incidents or moments 
when somebody told a joke or a story that they had

13:02.322 --> 13:15.143
been telling to an all-male audience and it didn't 
go over well? Well, there were some of those, yeah,

13:16.405 --> 13:19.050
right. I don't remember any one in specific, but I 
do remember in general that there were times when

13:19.070 --> 13:26.001
stuff like that would happen. But generally, the 
Aggies are good people. They're well-behaved,

13:32.774 --> 13:35.080
well-mannered young men. And they would never 
give the girls a bad time. They might needle them a

13:39.050 --> 13:42.960
little bit, but it was always in good humor. I would 
never try to embarrass them. I don't ever remember

13:44.802 --> 13:46.543
that happening. Sometimes the girls would get 
embarrassed because they would say something

13:46.563 --> 13:58.574
because just in their natural youthful 
exuberance, they would say something that if the

13:46.563 --> 13:58.574
girls hadn't been there, it would have been OK. But 
because the girls were there, it wasn't OK. But

14:00.936 --> 14:10.185
that ended up fairly quickly because of the fact 
that the female enrollment built up quite

14:00.936 --> 14:10.185
strongly, very quickly in geophysics. And so 
there were always females around. women

14:12.927 --> 14:14.529
students. So, yeah, how to behave yourself, you 
know. And besides, it was just, that was the Texan

14:19.273 --> 14:25.319
stuff, the good manners of the Texan stuff anyway. 
Did you have any particular classroom or

14:26.260 --> 14:38.192
laboratory guidelines that you made clear to the 
students, what they were to do and not to do? Yeah, I

14:39.337 --> 14:47.175
told them that when they came on in, Texas A&M had 
the policy that the students were required to

14:39.337 --> 14:47.175
attend classes. I told them that I felt that they 
were adults and that that was really not

14:47.817 --> 14:51.085
necessary. I told them that I would take the role 
for the first two weeks. And I said, the reason why I

14:54.693 --> 14:59.381
would take roll for the first two weeks was so that I 
could put a name with the face. And after that, I

14:59.821 --> 15:01.704
wouldn't need it anymore. I actually didn't even 
need it for two weeks. I said, whether they came or

15:03.768 --> 15:05.951
not was up to them. I told them that my purpose of 
being there was to teach them. And if they could

15:10.278 --> 15:15.847
learn the subject without coming to class, that 
was fine by me. All they had to do is know when the

15:15.887 --> 15:21.156
exams were, be there on time, get their homework 
in, get it in on time. And that they didn't need to be

15:21.136 --> 15:30.573
there to gratify my ego, that they would make me 
feel good, make my ego feel good if they got good

15:21.136 --> 15:30.573
scores on the exam. So that was the way in which I 
played it. I very rarely had kids not go to class at

15:33.038 --> 15:37.245
the same time. Mostly because I think I taught them 
some things during the lecture as well. Did you

15:44.423 --> 15:52.879
ever have any less than credible excuses for 
missing a test or an absence of any sort? Well, not

15:53.961 --> 16:03.259
on absences because I never asked for... No, but I 
mean maybe because they missed something and they

15:53.961 --> 16:03.259
tried to explain why they weren't there. Oh, no, 
no, because if there were, I wouldn't remember

16:03.323 --> 16:11.257
them because I'd say, it doesn't matter to me. You 
want to come, you come, you didn't come. If you

16:13.441 --> 16:18.991
didn't come, it's your responsibility to go find 
out what happened during the class and to make up

16:13.441 --> 16:18.991
for it. It felt like I were treating them as adults, 
and I expected them to understand what was going on

16:19.071 --> 16:28.167
and to take care of it. They were past 18, well all of 
them were 20, 21 years old. They were seniors,

16:33.314 --> 16:36.559
juniors and seniors. I saw no reason to treat them 
as children and did not. The best one I ever had was

16:42.046 --> 16:50.037
the student who came up very seriously the first 
day to tell me about his grandfather's illness.

16:50.017 --> 16:52.562
and that it apparently was terminal. And I began to 
feel very sorry for him. And he told me that, in

16:56.150 --> 17:01.782
fact, it was almost certain that his grandfather 
would die the first day of deer season.

17:05.525 --> 17:07.548
And he wanted me to know that in advance. And he was a 
deer hunter. Yeah, and we both chuckled over that.

17:14.277 --> 17:16.880
Did you get one for me, did you say? Let's see. More 
departmental. Do you remember any departmental

17:20.064 --> 17:24.951
crises where y'all were felt up against the wall on 
a budget matter or a vacancy at the last moment in a

17:24.931 --> 17:37.270
faculty or something like that? No. No crises of 
that sort? I don't think so. No, there's nothing

17:41.961 --> 17:43.503
that we couldn't handle. You know, you expect 
things to come up. We haven't had any natural

17:46.246 --> 17:49.490
disasters where the building... No. Over the 
years, has the space for offices, labs, and

17:50.671 --> 17:59.342
lectures been reasonably adequate? Oh yeah, 
plenty adequate. As a matter of fact, I personally

18:02.506 --> 18:09.315
think there's a lot of wasted space at this 
university, but don't quote me on that. In fact,

18:09.335 --> 18:11.478
more adequacy than parking. Yeah, right, right, 
yes. Let's see. Describe your work with graduate

18:16.003 --> 18:20.890
students, theses and dissertations. You must 
over the years have produced a number of those.

18:23.842 --> 18:26.846
Yeah, I'd have about 10 PhDs.

18:28.869 --> 18:31.994
Usually they would come on in and they'd say, well, 
we want to work on a problem. And sometimes some of

18:32.134 --> 18:37.562
them would have an idea of what they wanted to do, 
but generally they didn't. I generally had three

18:38.143 --> 18:45.794
or four topics that I thought needed to be done, and 
I would suggest them to them. Also, in the classes

18:46.194 --> 18:51.402
that I taught, I required all the students to do a 
term paper. And I gave them a bunch of topics from

18:51.382 --> 18:58.817
which to pick, and also they gave a presentation as 
well. And a lot of them took those presentations

18:59.158 --> 19:05.070
and used those for dissertation topics. So that's 
the way it ended, and we kind of worked together at

19:05.591 --> 19:12.225
it. I'm not sure we ever published any on these 
things. Of course, we've been pretty bad. My

19:17.360 --> 19:19.228
students have been pretty bad about publishing. 
I've been pretty bad about publishing, too. As a

19:23.292 --> 19:32.707
matter of fact, one of the things I'm hoping during 
my retirement to do is publish some of the

19:23.292 --> 19:32.707
dissertations that my students have done jointly 
with them, of course, you realize. But we

19:33.047 --> 19:35.471
generally work very closely together. I've 
always felt that you can teach people to be

19:35.491 --> 19:40.078
creative. I think there's a very definite 
technique for doing it. To do dissertation type

19:43.984 --> 19:49.873
work, there has to be a creative aspect to it. But I 
don't think it's impossible. I don't think

19:53.031 --> 19:55.994
there's a big deal to it. And I think I eventually 
got the kids to the point where they, too, became

19:56.915 --> 20:03.383
creative. Or they would start making ideas and 
making suggestions. I'd say, hey, why don't we do

20:07.668 --> 20:08.990
this? Yeah, OK. And that was just fine. Of course, 
part of it might have been that they were maturing

20:11.913 --> 20:16.398
and building up their background. And it's very 
hard to be creative without having any ability.

20:20.363 --> 20:27.100
Most of these theses and dissertations, are they 
in the same general area? Topic area? No, not

20:32.031 --> 20:33.793
really. They're kind of diverse, just like my is 
the diverse. Different areas. One is involved.

20:45.026 --> 20:48.189
One area would be data processing. Another area 
would be seismic wave propagation. Another area

20:51.153 --> 20:54.977
are rock properties. Let's see, the other is this 
physics of the earth kind of thing. Of which of

21:01.572 --> 21:10.873
these graduate student theses and 
dissertations, of which are you most proud as you

21:01.572 --> 21:10.873
reflect in hindsight? Yeah, that's a good 
question. I think Jean-Claude Maréchal's

21:15.904 --> 21:21.700
dissertation is the one that I'm the proudest of. 
And that's the one where he did take this Moho stuff

21:22.001 --> 21:27.276
and he did some calculations on it. But I've had a 
couple of other students who did some really nice

21:27.256 --> 21:31.300
stuff. Some of it was pretty practical, like Buck 
Behan. He did one on adaptive data processing,

21:34.604 --> 21:41.471
which is an area that I've been interested in a long 
time. And Dan Hines did some stuff on the

21:41.952 --> 21:52.283
deformation of rocks, looking at them under a 
microscope, which I thought was very

21:41.952 --> 21:52.283
interesting. Also correlation technique and 
data processing involved in that. So there have

21:55.927 --> 22:00.116
been half a dozen or so that were really quite good. 
I've been proud of most of my PhDs. Well, I'm proud

22:04.426 --> 22:07.052
of all of them, all the PhD students. Master's 
students, maybe some of them got by with all the

22:07.393 --> 22:13.446
PhDs. did solid work, as far as I'm concerned. In 
the department, who are some, were the key staff

22:18.163 --> 22:26.863
members during the years working in the 
departmental offices and so forth? Who were some

22:26.883 --> 22:30.591
people that deserve a pat on the back? Well, 
certainly Anita Ficke was one. She worked with the

22:33.685 --> 22:37.329
Underburger first and then became part of the 
department. And Michelle, who's now down in the

22:39.031 --> 22:46.599
geology office, Michelle Beale, she has been very 
useful. There was Linda, oh, gee, it was a redhead.

22:50.543 --> 22:52.185
Oh, gosh, what's her name? Oh. I can't remember. I 
can see her face, but I can't remember her name. The

22:57.779 --> 22:59.664
Alzheimer's are going to get to me, I guess. But she 
was very, very important and very effective. She

23:02.893 --> 23:09.792
was the secretary when I was the acting head, and 
she was very important, very effective.

23:11.577 --> 23:24.123
Some of the others that we've had, there was 
another gal named Linda who was pretty good, but

23:11.577 --> 23:24.123
some of them actually were, well, they were there, 
but they weren't really much use. Do you remember

23:24.143 --> 23:32.640
any important decisions made elsewhere on campus 
that had a big impact on the department?

23:35.776 --> 23:37.259
No, I don't think so. Were there any state 
decisions, legislature, governor,

23:37.439 --> 23:42.628
coordinating board? No,

23:42.648 --> 23:48.077
I really don't think so. More recently there may be 
the business about limiting the number of hours

23:48.979 --> 23:59.337
that students can take, but that's a recent thing, 
and the graduate programs. Actually, they always

23:59.485 --> 24:06.417
seemed to have made a very good environment for us 
to do what we wanted to do. It was kind of up to us to do

24:06.437 --> 24:08.040
something. And the state of Texas and Texas A&M 
have been reasonably competitive in salaries and

24:08.480 --> 24:19.840
scholarship offers and things like that? In 
scholarship offers, yes. I think that we've had

24:23.999 --> 24:28.465
people who've been very generous to the 
university. I don't think the university itself

24:28.786 --> 24:32.632
has been very competitive in terms of salaries. Is 
that right? Yeah. I know my own salary has been

24:34.395 --> 24:44.991
pretty poor and would have been glad to have made a 
move if I could have, but didn't have the

24:34.395 --> 24:44.991
opportunity. If you could be the czar, Which 
geophysics programs nationally would you today

24:49.503 --> 25:03.422
hold out as models of quality that A&M should try to 
equal or surpass? I would say MIT, Caltech, UCLA

25:03.442 --> 25:12.574
are amongst the top ones.

25:14.444 --> 25:16.748
Are there any others that are really high? 
Berkeley's pretty good. Yeah. And Stanford. And

25:24.361 --> 25:26.765
Rice is getting a pretty good program.

25:29.430 --> 25:34.258
If you, all right, are there any changes if you had 
an unlimited budget? And again, you were czar of

25:34.441 --> 25:36.888
the department. Are there any changes you would 
make in the department today? What I'm really

25:40.317 --> 25:50.644
asking is what advice, if you were called upon as 
the consultant, what course of action would you

25:40.317 --> 25:50.644
advise the department to undertake today? I would 
rather not say anything about that question.

25:59.444 --> 26:10.320
Getting near the end of the questions I can think 
of, who is there that you would like to thank for

25:59.444 --> 26:10.320
these 30 plus years here? Oh, well, I think I'd like 
to thank the state and the university because it's

26:10.300 --> 26:17.651
been a nice environment. I've enjoyed it. So I 
don't really feel like the people, Earl Cook made

26:21.317 --> 26:31.412
me feel comfortable and welcome. So did Horace 
Byers.

26:38.752 --> 26:45.143
Department heads, I'm not sure that I really got 
along all that well with any of them. Earl Hoskins

26:45.483 --> 26:49.170
was probably the one that I got along best with.

26:52.095 --> 26:55.801
Of course, I have a hard time getting along with 
people anyway. It's part of my problem, but that's

26:56.082 --> 26:59.848
my problem, not theirs. Can I think of anybody else 
who really made it a great place to be? Well, I've

27:04.786 --> 27:07.530
enjoyed having Bob Berg around. I spent time 
talking with him, learned a good bit of geology

27:09.533 --> 27:25.617
from him, and perhaps learned how to survive a 
little better in academia because of him as well.

27:26.170 --> 27:28.294
Anybody else that I can think of? No. Well, John 
Hand had an influence also.

27:35.306 --> 27:44.621
John was a very strong person and a very good 
organizer and good scientist and knew how to do

27:35.306 --> 27:44.621
things. And I always admired and enjoyed having 
him. And he always treated me fairly, I thought.

27:54.301 --> 27:55.002
Well, let's see. If you have any A&M related 
materials and you ever want to dispose of them, I

27:55.983 --> 28:16.309
would beg you please call the A&M archives because 
they would organize them and maintain them,

27:55.983 --> 28:16.309
particularly any memorabilia about the 
institution. Okay, like the photographs. That

28:23.077 --> 28:23.878
kind of thing. Oh, yes, yes, yes. Grade books. 
Okay.

28:30.747 --> 28:33.590
Evaluations of the department and that sort of 
thing. Okay. All right. Next, the last question.

28:39.317 --> 28:39.657
Okay. If someone gave you a million dollar check, 
with one requirement, that you give it to Texas A&M

28:44.875 --> 28:59.087
and you decide what use would be made of it, if you 
had a large sum of money you could pass on to A&M,

28:44.875 --> 28:59.087
what would you want it used for? I think I'd use it 
for scholarships, undergraduate, graduate

29:00.704 --> 29:08.523
scholarships for those students interested in 
theoretical geophysics. A million dollars is a

29:09.004 --> 29:12.834
lot of money, however. How would you identify the 
students? Who gets the scholarship? Well, it

29:17.545 --> 29:19.950
would depend on, first of all, their interest. 
They'd have to have an interest in doing

29:19.970 --> 29:22.536
theoretical stuff. They'd have to show an ability 
to do it, which means that they'd have to have a good

29:22.556 --> 29:30.975
background in math and physics and geology and an 
interest in the field. So you'd make it

29:32.258 --> 29:35.385
ability-based, talent-based. primarily yeah 
right yeah I think because you can get the ability

29:36.209 --> 29:50.421
most anywhere you know I was certainly wouldn't do 
it racially or you wouldn't do it on a need basis

29:36.209 --> 29:50.421
financial need as much as ability Well, I would 
rather it went to somebody who needed it, but at the

29:51.616 --> 29:59.887
same time, I would presume that whoever's asking 
for it does need it. Otherwise, if they don't need

29:59.907 --> 30:02.711
it, I would say, hey, don't take it. Clearly, yeah, 
right. Need should be a consideration, but not the

30:07.077 --> 30:10.602
most important consideration. I wouldn't give it 
to a bad needy student, let a good, not so needy

30:11.463 --> 30:17.691
student go by. Last question. What feelings do you 
have in your heart today about Texas A&M? Oh, I

30:25.648 --> 30:26.990
think it was a great place. It was a good place to be. 
I spent a lot of my life here. I think I could have

30:29.714 --> 30:35.002
been treated better. I think my contributions 
could have been recognized better. And the salary

30:43.861 --> 30:53.592
really wasn't very important, per se, because I 
got more money than I know what to do with now, even

30:43.861 --> 30:53.592
with the salary that I had, which wasn't very good. 
But the fact is that there were other people who

30:54.893 --> 31:01.120
were getting salaries that were much more than 
mine. And I felt their contributions to the

31:01.460 --> 31:05.104
university weren't equal to mine. And that sort of 
bothered me more. I would rather they had cut the

31:07.587 --> 31:11.151
other guy's salary.
