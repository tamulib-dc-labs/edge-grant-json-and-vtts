WEBVTT

00:02.073 --> 00:05.037
And President Williams gave us the money to buy his 
equipment. Oh, Williams. Jack. Jack Williams and

00:07.520 --> 00:15.030
Dr. Gammon, Ray Gammon, were born 30 miles apart. 
Huh. He ride on the edge of the Virginia border,

00:15.150 --> 00:18.314
didn't he? Yep. And Galax. Is it Galax? Oh, it's 
from Galax. Galax. And Dr. Gammon and we were on the

00:23.842 --> 00:27.727
railroad. And we're not quite sure whether his 
town is in one county or the other. One county

00:34.255 --> 00:36.658
doesn't have too good a reputation. If I were 
kidding Williams, which I haven't had a chance to

00:36.678 --> 00:48.354
do, I'd say his hometown is at the end of a little 
one-horse spur that goes south from Pulaski. Yes,

00:50.537 --> 00:52.119
it's just a line. We had the through line where we 
lived right there at River Creek with the highest

00:52.239 --> 00:58.067
point. of the line of the railroad, the Southern 
Railroad, between New York, Washington, and New

00:58.402 --> 01:06.771
Orleans. So you see it's very nice there, but 
they've taken most of it off. Do you have any

01:11.797 --> 01:15.941
recollections of Dean Bolton as a man? Dean 
Bolton? Dean Bolton was positive. That's what I

01:19.705 --> 01:21.267
would say about him. But he was kindly. We've had 
very nice relationship with him. Mrs. Bolton was,

01:27.730 --> 01:32.034
you could see the humor in everything. She was 
quite a laugher. Rather motherly, I would say. I

01:38.000 --> 01:40.182
would say rather motherly, speaking of Mrs. 
Bolton. Mrs. Bolton? Mrs. Bolton was that, too.

01:42.905 --> 01:46.829
Mrs. Bolton was lovely and gave the loveliest 
parties imaginable. Let me think now about

01:47.149 --> 01:49.291
Bolton. Well, we were on two sides in a church 
discussion.

01:57.143 --> 02:02.689
I remember Ray brought up a, this is your 
information. It's not going on there, is it? Well,

02:04.450 --> 02:06.593
I can take it off if you want me to. I don't care. Oh, 
is it still running? Oh, yes, it's running. Oh,

02:10.216 --> 02:20.367
well, I remember we were on two sides of a church 
situation that's not very pleasant. And it's

02:21.047 --> 02:22.729
better to be. on two points, politically then, 
enthusiastically. And I remember when you made a

02:27.644 --> 02:35.757
parliamentary statement, which was new to the 
smart aleck you. And I remember Bolton turned

02:36.337 --> 02:42.247
around real suddenly to look as much as to say, now 
who's opposing me? But it wasn't ugly. It was just

02:43.949 --> 02:45.552
his nature. So that's all I know. Did you have 
occasion to work with him very often in your

02:48.140 --> 02:52.225
capacity? Yes. He was dean of the college. Yes. And 
not in charge of the history department

02:56.871 --> 03:03.099
especially unless it was something related to the 
college properly. I remember something. No,

03:06.444 --> 03:09.407
Bolton, I got along very well when we had the 
conference. Oh, sure. We all got along very well.

03:12.852 --> 03:16.797
But Bolton and you, you had been thinking about 
great issues course and Bolton had two and I can't

03:17.232 --> 03:43.273
remember how you got together on that but he was the 
staff at the great issues course bringing people

03:17.232 --> 03:43.273
in here including uh Churchill uh Churchill's son 
Randolph Churchill and uh many other prominent

03:17.232 --> 03:43.273
people and uh so no Marshall was up there in Austin 
and uh And they worked that out. And it was, I

03:45.506 --> 03:55.916
believe, much more sort of academically oriented 
than it is now. Now the students have taken it over,

03:56.076 --> 03:59.179
and that's all right. But

03:59.680 --> 04:05.966
do you think perhaps students have taken over too 
much of everything? I don't know. And I don't think

04:07.368 --> 04:10.951
we will know until we see the long run effect of it. 
Well, I mean, all over the country. Not here so

04:14.641 --> 04:15.622
much. Yes, in other places. Well, here we are 
military. Here we are. We have become a little more

04:20.930 --> 04:26.839
student-oriented here, but not nearly so much as 
the rest of the country. Out in California? Oh,

04:28.121 --> 04:28.542
yes. Oh, that's terrible. But as far as that's 
concerned, it's all over. The young are not very

04:34.170 --> 04:39.157
satisfied, and I cannot say that I blame them. 
Well, did you notice when Vice President Ford was

04:39.177 --> 04:43.804
here, did you happen to watch the news that night. 
And they said on national television, at

04:45.716 --> 04:50.782
conservative Texas A&M University. So we still 
have the label. That is a conservative element

04:52.364 --> 04:55.988
here from the beginning. They dressed 
conservatively. Our dinner dresses were

04:59.292 --> 05:02.857
conservative. I remember thinking that somebody 
who was more chic and interested in being modern,

05:02.937 --> 05:12.188
we did have some people like that. who were 
atheists and very, very modern, and what we would

05:12.455 --> 05:19.725
call modern. And I think even now, we might say they 
were more radically inclined. But I noticed that

05:28.136 --> 05:34.184
her dinner dresses were conservative, just like 
mine. So it was. The whole place was conservative.

05:38.230 --> 05:41.955
They didn't want drunks living here or teaching 
here. And they didn't want loose living people

05:42.323 --> 05:45.747
here. There was another divorce, and two 
divorces, but one was quite a few years earlier.

05:54.997 --> 05:57.921
And then another divorce, and the two married. 
They were not here after that year, you see? And

06:02.306 --> 06:06.010
that was not under Walton. I think it was under 
Bolton, wasn't it? Or anyway, there was a trip down

06:09.121 --> 06:12.686
to Houston. There was one of the men. He's not here 
anymore. I could give you the name because I have a

06:15.290 --> 06:22.942
play on his name. Call it something slightly 
different, but still like his. And he made rather

06:29.692 --> 06:38.065
verbal, improper advances to one of the 
secretaries. who reported it. And I think it was

06:40.307 --> 06:48.454
the dean's secretary, a very nice looking young 
woman. And it was reported to the then Dean Bolton,

06:48.875 --> 06:53.099
the dean of the college. Or he may have been 
president. No, he was dean then. But he was given 24

06:57.162 --> 07:00.025
hours to get out. And it blew up. Well, I should not 
give names. But it blew up a little organization,

07:05.551 --> 07:09.796
which was very, very, very, you know. And one of the 
members later told me, she is not living now, that

07:10.516 --> 07:25.773
wasn't it good that that happened before he and I 
were going to give a party together. I could tell

07:25.793 --> 07:29.897
you the names, and it's really fun. It's a story. 
It's a story. How was the social life living on the

07:34.576 --> 07:37.920
campus? Oh, fine. Oh, fine. Did you play bridge? 
Did you have teams together? Bridge, a good bit of

07:41.223 --> 07:42.104
bridge. But we gave up bridge because, and I'll 
tell you what we used to have. We used to have the

07:46.569 --> 07:50.753
cadets as babysitters for our young children. 
That's wonderful. Now that is about, we had one for

07:51.674 --> 07:53.837
years. And he would come and do his lessons. Our 
children were quiet and well-behaved, but they

07:56.820 --> 08:04.228
had funny streets to them too, for instance. 
Samarie used big words and astounded everybody by

08:04.698 --> 08:10.804
his big words. And Billy was our elder son. Let's 
see up there. Was asked by our younger son at a

08:18.612 --> 08:26.039
certain period in his life when Camp stared him in 
the face. And he asked his elder brother, Camp,

08:26.500 --> 08:30.744
would you go to Camp? And Billy, for less than so, 
said, No, they make you have fun. So you see, there

08:38.054 --> 08:41.719
are lots of fun. And then I told you about the 
children roamed all over the campus, that nice

08:41.799 --> 08:55.760
little campus of that little place we went to with 
only 2,000 students and six or eight PhDs. The

08:57.503 --> 08:59.606
children could roam all over the campus. And when 
the 5 o'clock whistle blew, we almost knew what

09:00.187 --> 09:03.612
time it was. Because we had that 8 o'clock whistle, 
the 12 o'clock whistle, the 1 o'clock whistle, and

09:03.912 --> 09:11.241
the 5 o'clock whistle. And when the 5 o'clock siren 
was a-bloo, all the children came home. It was

09:16.387 --> 09:17.188
beautiful. So you see, there were so many sort of 
home-like things. And Dr. Walton was right. It was

09:25.319 --> 09:27.481
sort of we looked after each other. I remember Mrs. 
Riley once called me up and said, Billy, Only about

09:33.342 --> 09:37.567
five. Yeah, he was five years old. And he was 
heading for a kindergarten, a little spring up

09:38.789 --> 09:42.974
kindergarten. We had all sorts of little things 
that the mothers would get excited about our

09:42.994 --> 09:49.903
children should have. And that was not 
grammatical. And so Billy was walking down the

09:53.768 --> 10:02.539
street past the Dean Friley home just a stone's 
throw from us. And on his way to this little sort of

10:02.941 --> 10:15.136
impetuous kindergarten, it just sprang up 
itself. And he was wading in the gutter where there

10:15.736 --> 10:21.143
was flowing water. So Mrs. Crowley called me up and 
said, your son Billy is walking in the water that's

10:21.443 --> 10:31.455
flowing down the gutter. He'll get his feet wet. 
And you see how we looked after each other? So I went

10:36.395 --> 10:41.600
down and got home and got his shoes and socks 
changed. Let's see. What else? Any personal

10:44.223 --> 10:46.305
touches about people? Are you trying to dig out 
any? No. You just want things as they are. These

10:53.392 --> 10:54.633
people are gone now. And not many people remember 
things about them, what type of people they were.

11:00.559 --> 11:02.361
And I'm afraid it will be lost. That's what we're 
interested in. What kind of people were they?

11:06.630 --> 11:16.024
You're interested in the people as opposed or 
different from the college itself, from the

11:06.630 --> 11:16.024
university itself. And how it colored the 
university. I see what you're trying to do. I think

11:21.972 --> 11:27.040
I'll write that up myself and maybe get it 
published and make a lot of money. Oh, and I'll tell

11:27.060 --> 11:28.382
you what we had. We had a, oh, you must get that. We 
had the people on the campus and then later those

11:33.497 --> 11:49.376
that moved south of the campus when the campus 
became too crowded and the college grew larger and

11:33.497 --> 11:49.376
expanded and had more faculty as a matter of 
course. They moved south, which developed that

11:49.857 --> 11:57.846
way later.

11:58.467 --> 12:02.771
The division across Texas Avenue was a later 
development. But south of the campus, they called

12:02.871 --> 12:10.577
it Oakwood, and they called it West Park, and they 
called it College. College Park was over here. But

12:13.480 --> 12:17.383
let me see. I want to get back to where I grew up. When 
we had to move, oh, that was in 39. We moved back here

12:28.100 --> 12:31.104
in 41.

12:33.787 --> 12:35.389
Martinson built our house. And look how straight 
the lines still are after all these years. It's a

12:39.334 --> 12:41.556
wonderful, a wonderful builder. And, uh.

12:47.263 --> 12:48.405
But I was trying to think. Dr. Clark. F.B. Clark? 
Yep. F.B. Clark. I knew him. Clark Barzilla, in

12:54.212 --> 12:55.774
other words. Uh, Barzilla Clark. I knew him at 
Hopkins, where he was getting his degree in

12:57.867 --> 13:06.097
political science. But there was no political 
science department here. It was part of the

13:10.723 --> 13:12.486
history department. So he shifted to his minor, 
which was political economy. I knew him very well.

13:18.834 --> 13:23.279
In fact, I could show you pictures of where we had 
been in picnics together. I was a library

13:23.439 --> 13:27.064
assistant there at Johns Hopkins. in a certain 
section that we had departments allowed. That's

13:30.618 --> 13:31.278
very unusual. We should follow you here. And 
that's where we found each other. And

13:38.887 --> 13:46.735
in, let's see, I want to get back to the thing. I want 
to tell you that it seemed important then. Well,

13:49.278 --> 13:52.422
anyway, Dr. Clark then, no, he didn't follow us. 
Oh, you followed? He went up to the University of

13:53.523 --> 13:57.287
Pennsylvania, I think, first and married Ruth. 
And Ruth Clark and the Clarks, we were pretty good

13:57.689 --> 14:01.435
friends. But they never lived on the campus in our 
time. They had lived there some years before, but

14:04.560 --> 14:15.758
had built south there where he had bought up a whole 
lot of properties, he's a good economist, and was

14:04.560 --> 14:15.758
parceling it out. And that grew very quickly. So we 
had friends out there, the Adamses, the Clarks,

14:18.462 --> 14:24.692
oh, ever so many. came in later or had moved from the 
campus because they wanted to be, they wanted to

14:25.010 --> 14:35.826
live in their own home instead of what our son 
called the campus . And so a good many people moved

14:36.507 --> 14:42.817
out there, but that was still part of the campus in a 
way. Now I'm on to what I want to tell you. We had a

14:45.180 --> 14:54.274
social club, the A&M College Social Club, or the 
thing we called the Women's Social Club. But

14:54.727 --> 15:02.437
anyway, we had regular meetings and programs and 
refreshments, very tiresome. No, they weren't

15:02.817 --> 15:06.022
tiresome when we were all fixing them by 
ourselves. But when the college took over, it was

15:06.042 --> 15:12.470
punch and cookies, cookies and punch, punch and 
cookies, cookies and punch. But we had a very good

15:13.091 --> 15:21.021
time there together and made a big to-do over the 
newcomers that they came in. We had sometimes

15:21.423 --> 15:23.607
programs. In fact, Ruth Clark, Dr. F.B. Clark's 
wife, who died quite a few years ago, bless her, she

15:28.114 --> 15:33.362
was sweet. I always called her Gentle Ruth. She was 
program chairman, and she asked me to take over her

15:36.127 --> 15:41.215
program. And I didn't do a thing but put on 
something that I had put on up at Austin College, a

15:41.575 --> 15:48.747
pantomime. Somebody reading, I did the reading. 
And I have, you may have noticed, pretty clear

15:52.137 --> 15:56.043
enunciation. That's because I'm bilingual. And I 
put that on. It was a tale poking a little bit of fun

16:02.451 --> 16:08.840
at everything. And I read it. I had the two 
ministers' wives rolled up in a sheet, holding a

16:10.382 --> 16:18.193
sheet in front. Then I made them roll themselves up 
in the sheet. And that made the proscenium, you

16:23.191 --> 16:28.399
see, the stage setting. And I remember many other 
things. We had a circus one. Somebody, Joe

16:33.627 --> 16:35.209
Wolcott. Do you know Joe Wolcott? No, I don't 
believe so. The name's familiar. Well, they

16:39.796 --> 16:44.102
hadn't been here, I believe, as long as we, and did 
not live on the campus. I think they moved out there

16:44.182 --> 16:45.764
right away. He was a sister. And she's in the 
hospital, so it's no use. And he has cataract

16:53.532 --> 16:57.076
trouble. And we knew them not too well, but when we 
saw each other at the ophthalmologist, we were

16:57.717 --> 17:05.706
just so happy to see each other. I remember 
several, she put on a circus, I remember, once

17:06.668 --> 17:10.132
there. Then we also had the campus study club, 
which was a study of, literatures and poetries and

17:17.624 --> 17:20.248
so on. And I think I stumped them all by putting on 
one. And they always liked it. I always got picked

17:26.116 --> 17:29.241
on to make up programs. And I remember I did one on 
world literature. Well, that took and Tolstoy and

17:33.607 --> 17:38.474
pushed in the Russians. And that was all new. But it 
wasn't new to us, because we, as you see, are

17:40.236 --> 17:44.382
readers. And we got a lot of books in there, too. and 
some upstairs, and some in the corner in the front

17:46.700 --> 17:52.307
hall, which I'm trying to give away. And so those 
two organizations tied us together too, you see,

17:53.428 --> 17:59.996
the social club. And the social club, this is 
important, every Christmas gave a Christmas

18:00.296 --> 18:13.992
party to the students who didn't go home, or 
couldn't go home, or didn't want to go home, or were

18:00.296 --> 18:13.992
unable to go home. We gave a party for them at 
Christmas. And that was quite a big party. And I

18:18.716 --> 18:20.818
think it was Christmas Eve we got it. We did it. And 
of course, everybody went to it. Everybody on the

18:24.782 --> 18:25.903
campus. All the people sitting close. Where did 
they hold it? And the students, though the

18:28.026 --> 18:33.411
students were a little hold office on 
invitations. That hall was always available. Oh,

18:35.353 --> 18:35.834
I see. Yeah. What was always there? Where did they 
hold it? Oh, I know why. I know why. The same old wife

18:43.417 --> 18:45.880
without the solariums. They didn't have the 
solariums on that big. That was Mr. Cashin.

18:54.669 --> 19:06.081
But I think Mrs. Cashin, who's still living, is not 
as actively involved in this whole situation as we

18:54.669 --> 19:06.081
were. Of course, Mrs. Camel, but I doubt that you 
can interview her. But they came about a year or two

19:10.846 --> 19:12.968
before we did. But Mrs. Marsh stole her. But that 
won't do. She died some years ago saying she had had

19:17.991 --> 19:23.598
a happy life, a good, hot life. And she was going 
well satisfied and grateful for what she'd had.

19:28.845 --> 19:29.767
She was very fine. But she was, I think, born on the 
campus. Or at least her father was head of the

19:33.371 --> 19:37.897
English department fountain. There's a plaque in 
the light. meeting room of the YMCA dedicated to

19:42.968 --> 19:50.474
fountains. And I do not know, I believe there's 
some fountains living in town in Nice, because so

19:51.115 --> 20:00.984
many people, when they came here, their families 
dragged along. But we didn't. They were in

20:01.884 --> 20:06.008
Virginia. But so many came here, including the 
Cashin family, the Walton family, the Maristella

20:06.028 --> 20:12.013
family. And I don't know the other Walton family. 
And so they settled around here. But I believe the

20:19.525 --> 20:26.251
Fountain family are too far out, probably 
grandniece and so on. But Mrs. Marskeller could

20:26.492 --> 20:33.598
have told you way, way back then when they used to 
have to drive to Bryan. I've heard her. Drive to

20:35.160 --> 20:37.682
Bryan in their buggies. People didn't have cars so 
much in those days. And the road was kind of. Of

20:41.913 --> 20:45.038
course, the roads were muddy here when we first 
came out here. This was developed. There have been

20:47.081 --> 20:54.113
the college people and the Brown people have 
developed so many subdivisions around here and

20:47.081 --> 20:54.113
made millions. You see, college is quite a place to 
make your millions anyway. And for a while, there

20:58.981 --> 21:04.149
was antagonism between college and Brown. But I 
think that sort of petered out, except maybe some

21:04.810 --> 21:08.376
of the old timers. But we lived on the campus, and we 
moved to Bryant, you see. So we didn't have that at

21:11.864 --> 21:13.967
all. I mean, we were too busy having other things 
and doing other things. We didn't have time for

21:17.271 --> 21:20.715
stuff like that. But I think that's all right now. 
But you see, I don't know if you're a historian

21:22.437 --> 21:29.726
enough to know the antagonism that has always 
existed from medieval times. Isn't that so? Town

21:30.567 --> 21:31.448
and gown. Town and gown, always. Town and gown. 
Right. Well, that's way back from medieval times.

21:36.455 --> 21:36.795
Yes, ma'am. And I think it was that, uh, at 
Washington and Lee to, but not at Johns Hopkins.

21:44.331 --> 21:48.698
Johns Hopkins wasn't that one of the first that 
gave PhDs in history. It's one of the oldest. I

21:50.781 --> 21:52.324
don't remember what I believe it was. They 
advanced. It was one of the most advanced

21:53.746 --> 22:01.819
higher education, that is, beyond the four-year 
collegiate. And so, of course, I think, but I think

22:02.373 --> 22:17.954
Doug Gammon followed his head of department at 
Washington and Lee, who went to Johns Hopkins and

22:02.373 --> 22:17.954
knew all sorts of important people, including 
Woodrow Wilson, my friend. You remember? Oh, we

22:18.735 --> 22:20.057
had so many funny things. Oh, well, I didn't. We 
don't think about them. Now we've gotten to

22:23.121 --> 22:24.623
thinking about them. What else? Anything else you 
want? I can't remember any crimes. No, not

22:32.275 --> 22:33.897
interested in that particularly. There wasn't 
anything like that. It was so peaceful. Well,

22:36.921 --> 22:39.003
that's probably part of it. That campus, it was 
secure. What do you remember about the early days

22:42.468 --> 22:48.916
of the Depression, the effect upon the students, 
the effect upon the school? The early days? Say

22:51.619 --> 22:54.483
1929 on, with the start of the Depression. Our 
appropriations from the legislature were not

22:54.503 --> 22:57.967
badly reduced. Cut down a little bit in the 
interest of the economy, But we didn't suffer.

23:02.278 --> 23:04.781
Being state supported, we suffered about as 
little as any of them. We were reduced how much? One

23:07.144 --> 23:08.406
quarter. But we had two years warning. So as I told 
Helen Summitt, I said, we're cutting ourselves

23:11.009 --> 23:15.955
right now. Then we'll be prepared for that. In 
other words, we didn't suffer at all. We still went

23:22.723 --> 23:23.784
to Virginia. We began laying aside in time. We used 
to go to Virginia. You'd see practically every

23:27.168 --> 23:29.451
summer, get up in that lovely summer. But later 
that legislature over there in Austin, am I

23:29.802 --> 23:37.129
pointing in the right direction? Anyway, I point. 
You see, that's disrespectful.

23:45.538 --> 23:55.067
They didn't understand why professors should 
teach only four to five hours a day. They should

23:55.402 --> 23:59.726
have a full load, like a construction worker. Not 
coming to your land. I mean, part of architecture.

24:04.371 --> 24:05.332
No, I'm a historian. I'm not an architect. Oh, 
you're not an architect? I thought you were in the

24:08.916 --> 24:10.838
architect department. No, no, I'm a historian. 
Oh, you're a teacher in the history department?

24:17.264 --> 24:17.985
I'm an archivist. Your husband could tell you the 
differences. I'm a keeper of manuscripts and

24:20.548 --> 24:23.991
papers.

24:30.468 --> 24:35.354
archivist rather than architect.

24:36.876 --> 24:39.299
Well, we like the word archivist very well. That 
fits our way of thinking. In fact, when we had to

24:42.083 --> 24:56.782
have a heritage club,

24:42.083 --> 24:56.782
an organization, a committee in the church to 
preserve all the artifacts and all that, we had

24:42.083 --> 24:56.782
quite a little time on what to call it. And of 
course, our inclination was bookish. And we

25:00.033 --> 25:02.816
thought, our kind. But the rest of them were more 
emotionally interested in it. So it got called

25:08.120 --> 25:11.644
Heritage Club, Heritage Committee. And we're on 
it. And in fact, we gave them, we're older now, and

25:13.165 --> 25:18.870
we can't do as much. So we feel that we should give 
more. And so we had given there. And we've also

25:25.116 --> 25:26.017
gone. We went to the meeting, I believe it was last 
Sunday. before yesterday, a week ago. And we gave

25:32.673 --> 25:35.537
them some bookcases. Oh, that doesn't need to go on 
that. It doesn't need to go on that. Scratch it. I

25:41.304 --> 25:41.444
will. Take it. When I thought, oh, well, we'll give 
those two old bookcases, a six-section, glassed

25:42.485 --> 25:56.002
in to put their books and other, oh, so many papers, 
so many pictures. You ought to see what they have

25:56.042 --> 25:57.824
over there. Is this the first church? Right here? 
First Presbyterian Church in Bryan, asked to see

25:59.382 --> 26:02.165
it. And though we haven't got everything out that 
we need to have. And those six bookcases were given

26:06.350 --> 26:17.983
to Dr. Gavin in two Christmases by his father in 
1906 or so, when they had just been patented in

26:06.350 --> 26:17.983
1905. Because he was bookish, and his father 
encouraged it. And the reason he went to Austin

26:21.427 --> 26:28.275
College to try out teaching in the prep 
department, through the influence of two of the

26:28.711 --> 26:38.024
Mann family friends, because he loved books and 
had so many and received so many, just like our

26:28.711 --> 26:38.024
family did. Our family would sit around reading in 
utter silence for an evening. And then we'd notice

26:42.510 --> 26:45.714
that there was something different. And then it 
would be my wonderful father, who was always

26:46.035 --> 26:50.461
smiling. He was sitting around smiling, Edison 
smiling, because we were all reading instead of

26:50.841 --> 26:58.532
quarreling. No, I don't mean that, because we 
didn't quarrel. And let's see now. So archivist,

27:06.005 --> 27:09.387
let me think. Those two organizations, don't 
forget them. The social club, which really I think

27:12.790 --> 27:19.156
was organized to do for the boys that remained here 
at Christmas. And later, more people had cars and

27:19.836 --> 27:26.382
ways of transportation and so forth. So we didn't 
have so many boys at that time. But they always had

27:29.123 --> 27:31.947
the habit of inviting boys. But the boys were 
rather slow about wanting to get under the eye of

27:31.987 --> 27:38.336
the professors. They must have been a tough lot. 
And then that study club, which drew us still more

27:41.180 --> 27:47.128
together, you see. So when I was asked to join the 
woman's club in Bryan, which is quite it, that's an

27:47.308 --> 27:55.840
old club. I reneged because I felt that I owed it out 
there to college. We lived at college. Now I kind of

28:03.052 --> 28:06.115
wish I had joined them because I have many friends 
in there. In Bryan, you see, we have friends

28:06.796 --> 28:11.641
because we have never had these antagonisms. 
We've gone to the church in Bryan. So we have so many

28:14.844 --> 28:17.747
friends both ways. Well, let's see. Any more 
people you want? Well, I was trying to think. You

28:24.635 --> 28:26.838
must be Drew Pearson or something. No. No. Just a 
curious person by nature. No. Well, I think not

28:32.664 --> 28:40.234
Drew Pearson, but somebody else who was trying to 
catch leaks, let's say. That's the proper way to

28:41.575 --> 28:43.618
put it now. You see, we're living right now, even 
though we're 85.

28:50.085 --> 28:51.527
They tried to work. Our son tried to get him to join. 
One of them tried to get him. It was not Drew

28:57.851 --> 28:58.793
Pearson. I think Drew Pearson had died then. But it 
was somebody else on that same line, only not as

29:00.735 --> 29:11.711
grubby as Drew Pearson tried to get him to join him 
for luncheon. But fortunately, Samory had

29:11.751 --> 29:15.777
another engagement. And as he called us up and said 
the other day, by the way, he's pretty high. They

29:20.701 --> 29:23.305
don't have anybody in the State Department. All 
they have is a whole lot of military people that

29:23.325 --> 29:27.992
they write up this and that about. But has been vice 
consul, consul, consul general in Ethiopia, and

29:28.012 --> 29:42.514
consular for political affairs in our embassy in 
Rome, and is now on the same floor as Kissinger. I

29:42.574 --> 29:44.197
don't know how much I like that. Oh, you better 
delete that or they'll bug my phone. And he doesn't

29:49.827 --> 29:52.209
tell us anything. I was wondering, does he come 
home very, does he come to College Station? Well,

29:55.993 --> 29:56.974
it's been a great while. He came out here, and Dr. 
Tom Harrington. Dr. Tom Harrington. He is the

30:02.860 --> 30:11.269
chancellor emeritus that lived in on Creek, the 
Creek Road. Carter Creek? Back, no, not Carter,

30:12.210 --> 30:15.493
isn't that 32nd? It's, when you go on Wayside 
Drive, If you know, that leads off from Villa Maria

30:19.898 --> 30:25.166
Road. If you turn at Wayside Drive, you will cross 
the street that he lives on, but it's some kind of

30:25.587 --> 30:31.976
creek. And since he's retired, he moved to Bride. 
And I think he was wise. Because coming as

30:37.484 --> 30:44.375
Chancellor Emeritus and staying out there and 
being nobody, it's better to come in to Bride. And

30:45.096 --> 30:47.239
so I think he was wise on that. But he was so 
interested in Samurai, and so was this older crowd

30:47.523 --> 30:53.792
who all have died. And I think perhaps it was 
instrumental in some of this Rotary.

31:01.963 --> 31:17.023
He was also, he could have had a Fulbright, but he 
preferred a Rotary because it was paid off in

31:01.963 --> 31:17.023
American money, and the Fulbright scholarship or 
fellowship or whatever was paid up in the European

31:01.963 --> 31:17.023
money. American money, pretty smart. And he gets, 
he was down here, I can't remember what year,

31:19.364 --> 31:27.074
that's when he was in Ethiopia. And Dr. Tom 
Harrington, who was in charge, he had retired as

31:27.254 --> 31:37.467
chancellor, but he was doing something about 
international students or something like that.

31:37.488 --> 31:43.956
And he asked Ray, Sam Ray, to talk, to give a talk at 
the the Memorial Center in one of the rooms up

31:44.341 --> 31:47.905
there. I think it was the main ballroom. And about 
his work. But he calls up very frequently. But he

31:58.016 --> 32:01.540
has a pretty important job. Every bit of mail, 
every bit of pouch, the couriers carry their

32:02.340 --> 32:13.032
pouches strapped to their wrists with very secret 
documents And they don't leak, I think. And so all

32:15.143 --> 32:20.872
of that that comes in, he has to analyze and send it 
in the right direction. So he called up one

32:21.333 --> 32:23.677
particular time. And he always calls up on special 
occasions. But I suppose we talk to each other

32:27.543 --> 32:31.630
about two or three times a month. He called up, and 
there was no particular reason for it. And I said,

32:34.915 --> 32:36.658
well, what do you know? And he says, everything. 
But I'm not allowed to tell it. So that, but nothing

32:42.526 --> 33:03.702
ever gets into the battalion or into the, who at 
McQuillan used to be in charge of the students,

32:42.526 --> 33:03.702
the ex-students, or the alumni, or whatever. 
Former students. And alumni. The Association of

33:06.100 --> 33:08.564
the Former Students. The Former Students 
Association, but they call it. They don't know the

33:11.149 --> 33:13.634
word alumni, I guess.

33:16.579 --> 33:19.164
But it never gets in any of their records. And he's 
risen. He's in the secretariat, same floor as

33:20.426 --> 33:25.155
Kissinger and those other people. And I could tell 
quite a few things. that I have sort of survived

33:30.232 --> 33:39.785
because I like to think about these things in time 
together and make a life, a story, a world of them.

33:40.546 --> 33:43.950
So I think you've about drained me now. I think I've 
drained you both. I certainly appreciate it. I'm

33:46.995 --> 33:47.776
going to cut this off. But I would like to turn it up. 
He and Cam were here on the campus before we came and

33:50.499 --> 33:58.450
before either of them married. and Camel from 
Illinois, I think, and Coper from Kentucky. And

34:04.346 --> 34:05.227
D.B. Coper, he's not the one that's sick, is he? 
That's what I'd heard. Well, Mrs. Coper was raised

34:09.873 --> 34:18.205
in Bryan, and she would know a lot about it here, 
more than we, I'd say. And I don't know if you're

34:19.126 --> 34:26.496
telling her that I suggested her because she knew 
about as much as Mrs. Marsteller. who was raised on

34:26.830 --> 34:29.714
the campus and has died. That's important. Sarah 
Allen Cooper, do you know Allen Academy? She was

34:34.782 --> 34:36.925
the daughter of the Allens. One of the older ones. 
They're gone. And Mrs. Darnell, she's not living

34:41.151 --> 34:45.738
around here, she's a sister. But Mrs. Cooper, 
unless they would be, she would be disturbed.

34:51.086 --> 34:52.748
She's very tense and nervous. I don't know how good 
she would... I mean, you have to be lively, but not

34:56.598 --> 34:59.541
tense. And so I don't know whether you could, but 
she was raised in Brian. Therefore, she didn't

35:06.489 --> 35:07.651
know. And she and Margaret Camel, Margaret Camel 
was in Palestine and came visiting Sarah Allen for

35:07.711 --> 35:22.167
events here. They were both from Randall-Macon. 
They'd gone to college at Randall-Macon in

35:24.226 --> 35:27.511
Virginia, Pittsburgh. And so she would visit. So 
Dr. Camel, head of the Modern Language, and Phoebe

35:30.915 --> 35:41.950
Coker, in the English department, he never became 
head of it, but he became archivist. Yes, he was. He

35:42.811 --> 35:43.692
was the first one. And they courted the two girls. 
You see, they were blind dating and so on. So they,

35:49.180 --> 35:51.563
and that, Mrs. Hamill is not the one to see into the 
side. She's pretty far along in arthritis and

35:54.437 --> 35:58.422
things like that. But otherwise, I would tell her 
she's a very smart girl, woman, and has a good

35:59.183 --> 36:10.559
education over there around making girls color. 
But Mrs. Coker is quick and snappy like that, and I

36:10.980 --> 36:19.592
don't know how she would take questions like that. 
So, I don't mean there's anything wrong with their

36:20.332 --> 36:23.696
mind. No, no.
