WEBVTT

00:03.271 --> 00:06.604
Testing, one, two, three, four, one, two, three, 
four. Testing.

00:15.708 --> 00:32.105
This is October the 9th, sitting in the very 
pleasant office of Dennis Carrington, chatting

00:15.708 --> 00:32.105
with him about his experiences in what we used to 
call intramurals here at A&M. Dennis, for the sake

00:33.526 --> 00:43.516
of someone who might read this material and not be 
acquainted with you, describe your experience

00:33.526 --> 00:43.516
before getting to A&M. Where did you grow up? What 
did mom and dad do? Where did you go to college? And

00:47.624 --> 00:49.368
what did you do before coming here? I was born in 
Cherokee Island.

00:57.445 --> 01:00.852
My dad was a rent farmer. We lived on the farm until I 
think I was in sixth grade. And at that time, he

01:04.911 --> 01:15.946
decided I went to work for a local company that sold 
and delivered fertilizer to farmers in that part

01:04.911 --> 01:15.946
of the country. And at that time, moved to town. 
That was really a big deal to live in town. I spent

01:23.015 --> 01:27.261
the first several years of my life on the farm. 
doing things farm kids do. Of course, living in

01:28.920 --> 01:35.911
Quimby, Iowa, a town of about 400, wasn't much 
different than living in the country. It was a very

01:37.253 --> 01:38.294
small town. I grew up in a school district, small 
school district, very into sports. Sports were

01:48.487 --> 01:51.190
very important to the kids that went to school 
there. I always had good sports teams. That was

01:53.653 --> 02:00.121
probably my, the direction that I was headed in was 
probably started there in that school district. I

02:00.862 --> 02:03.845
started college at Iowa State University. I 
thought I'd play basketball there. Found out

02:06.649 --> 02:08.471
pretty quickly I wasn't quite good enough to play 
there. And I actually got a half scholarship to

02:09.692 --> 02:13.617
Morningside College, my sophomore year. Went 
there and played basketball on the freshman team

02:14.288 --> 02:18.315
that year.

02:21.319 --> 02:28.050
I was married

02:21.319 --> 02:28.050
at the time and had a child. I quit sports and 
started working my way through college. I started

02:34.361 --> 02:40.110
playing intramurals, actually, after putting 
varsity basketball. That was the first taste of

02:40.748 --> 02:45.677
intramurals, the first time I knew anything about 
intramurals. My degree was in physical

02:45.697 --> 02:47.640
education. At Morningside? At Morningside 
College. Morningside was about 1,200 students,

02:50.946 --> 02:54.933
probably, a Methodist-related school. Very good 
place to go to school, good liberal arts

02:55.794 --> 02:58.559
education. I had a degree in physical education, 
teaching certificate. I was planning on teaching

03:03.935 --> 03:12.608
and actually a teaching job offered to me and I also 
had the opportunity to do a graduate

03:03.935 --> 03:12.608
assistantship at Iowa State. At that point in time 
after doing my student teaching I decided maybe

03:13.589 --> 03:18.596
I'd be better off teaching in college than in high 
school. So I went to Iowa State, spent a year there

03:20.479 --> 03:29.692
and I worked with Len Rady who was involved with 
then the National Intramural Association. He was

03:31.495 --> 03:33.638
doing a presentation in Los Angeles and asked me to 
help him with it. So while I was there and doing the

03:37.218 --> 03:41.603
presentation, I met some people from Texas. They 
offered me a graduate assistantship. I spent four

03:47.130 --> 03:53.216
years at the University of Texas. Came to Texas 
A&M.

03:57.061 --> 03:59.283
How did you and Texas A&M link up? Carl Landis was 
the

04:12.802 --> 04:22.433
Carl Landis had called Sonny Rooker, who was the 
director of men's intramurals at the University

04:12.802 --> 04:22.433
of Texas, and asked him for a recommendation. 
Actually, I just looked at some old files here

04:23.595 --> 04:28.060
recently. There evidently was five people 
interviewed. I only knew that I was interviewed.

04:34.488 --> 04:40.335
There was actually five people interviewed for 
the job in the summer of 1973. In June of 73. job was

04:43.244 --> 04:45.026
offered to me in 1973. But it primarily based on the 
recommendation of Sonny Berger and copies of the

04:45.667 --> 04:52.095
recommendation letter, a really outstanding 
letter. Do you have any recollection of what they

04:52.896 --> 04:58.964
talked about or asked about in the interview? What 
did it appear they were looking for? Well, this is,

05:02.769 --> 05:07.816
I can't remember. This was in 1973 in the state of 
San Am. At that time, my hair was fairly long, about

05:10.278 --> 05:15.666
as long as it is right now, and I had a mustache. 
Sonny, a good friend of mine, said, Dennis, you

05:16.668 --> 05:23.338
might want to cut your hair and shave your mustache 
before you get out there. So I told him, Sonny, I'll

05:23.358 --> 05:27.144
cut my hair, but I don't want to shave my mustache. 
So I cut my hair a little shorter because the... He

05:30.764 --> 05:32.327
knew Carl Landis fairly well. He knew Carl was 
fairly conservative. And he was right. But even

05:37.057 --> 05:41.165
though my hair was a little long, Carl did hire me. 
We talked about what

05:41.987 --> 05:50.224
an opportunity there was at this university.

05:52.043 --> 05:56.070
The intramural program had been almost entirely 
core. Of course, the university was almost

05:57.232 --> 06:03.142
entirely core up until, you know, the late 70s 
probably. So there was, with women being fully

06:04.664 --> 06:17.005
admitted around 72, this really opened up the 
opportunity for an intramural program to expand

06:04.664 --> 06:17.005
and grow. It really created an opportunity to 
explore a lot of different possibilities.

06:26.505 --> 06:35.293
The good thing about the way it developed at Texas 
A&M, most of their schools at the universities at

06:26.505 --> 06:35.293
that time had a men's program and a women's 
program. Totally segregated. That didn't happen

06:37.735 --> 06:45.802
here because there weren't women

06:37.735 --> 06:45.802
here. It didn't happen until the early 70s. So we 
started basically with a program for everybody,

06:47.512 --> 06:56.150
men, women, and that allowed us to offer men's and 
women's programs from the same department. It

06:56.351 --> 06:59.517
allowed us to offer co-rec programs from the same 
department. Most of the universities had either

06:59.537 --> 07:02.945
two or three departments. Some of them had a men's 
program, a women's program, and a co-rec program.

07:05.872 --> 07:07.394
from my three different administrations. So we 
bypassed all that stuff, and we're pretty lucky

07:08.315 --> 07:14.282
because of the way things had developed here. And 
the women's program just kind of flowed with the

07:15.123 --> 07:31.844
rest of it, and there weren't the kind of the, you 
know, for a university that was all male, all of a

07:15.123 --> 07:31.844
sudden, the program looked a lot better than most 
places where they had been segregated for years.

07:32.645 --> 07:34.107
Were you replacing anyone? Actually, Carl Landis 
had put Les Palmer in the director's job, and Les

07:34.795 --> 07:47.841
did a lot of teaching in the kinesiology program, 
the physical education program. He's a great

07:48.282 --> 07:54.795
bowling instructor, he's a former baseball 
player, he taught a lot of different things over

07:48.282 --> 07:54.795
there, but bowling was probably his favorite. 
less wanted to go back to teaching carl placed him

07:55.889 --> 08:15.197
in the director's job to try to bring the program 
back up to to carl's standards it evidently

07:55.889 --> 08:15.197
slipped a little bit a few years before that and 
less wanted to go back to teach so that's what carl

07:55.889 --> 08:15.197
decided to take a look and see if he could find 
somebody And what they were looking for was

08:15.565 --> 08:21.244
somebody as young as me to take a program that was in 
pretty good shape and really move it forward. And

08:21.605 --> 08:24.134
that's kind of what we talked about in that 
interview. What was your title as you began? Your

08:26.753 --> 08:27.654
title? Director Venimeros. Director Venimeros. 
And you reported to? Arlandis. In the department

08:33.000 --> 08:34.321
of? Which was in the College of Education. So it was 
theoretically then, organizationally, it was an

08:41.108 --> 08:47.616
academically related. It was. The only 
difference that, the good difference, in this

08:54.901 --> 08:58.905
university is the money was coming from student 
fees. The student service fee was funding the

08:59.506 --> 09:01.568
program.

09:04.492 --> 09:14.422
So the nice thing about that is we weren't 
competing for academic money in a program that was

09:04.492 --> 09:14.422
not academically related. We were competing for 
student service money in the student service

09:14.883 --> 09:19.248
program and that was a good part of it. It just so 
happened that we reported through an And for many

09:23.521 --> 09:31.856
years, probably until sometime in the 80s, all of 
us or some of us taught in physical education. And

09:32.938 --> 09:35.082
your beginning salary? $12,600. $12,000

09:36.204 --> 09:44.258
in service fees and $600 for teaching, because I 
was teaching six, I think. And this is the fall of

09:44.338 --> 09:46.923
73? Fall of 73. Fall of 73. What facilities, what 
spaces did intramurals have? We were officed in

09:55.695 --> 09:58.278
DeWare Field House. There was a, at that time there 
was like a central office and that's where we had a

09:58.498 --> 10:17.524
full-time secretary, we had some student workers 
that worked there and kind of a counter set up to

09:58.498 --> 10:17.524
take entries and do all that business. There was 
actually an office behind that area that we used

10:17.875 --> 10:23.600
more for storage at that time. And then there was an 
office for the assistant director, an office for

10:24.781 --> 10:32.448
the director that's probably three times as big as 
my current office. It was huge. And then we had

10:34.089 --> 10:41.916
another office where we had equipment checkout 
and rental that serviced the DeWare facility.

10:42.617 --> 10:46.380
DeWare itself at that time was one big gymnasium. 
It had been remodeled at some point in time in the

10:48.132 --> 10:51.135
60s. There was 14

10:51.155 --> 10:56.460
handball courts on the upper level. They put in a 
second level, lowered the ceiling height in the

10:56.480 --> 11:06.390
old field house, and then put 14 handball courts up 
there. There was also a weight room that belonged

11:06.410 --> 11:10.494
to the athletic department. It was about 3,000 
square foot. And we used that weight room for

11:13.277 --> 11:16.300
recreation There

11:17.123 --> 11:30.941
was also a men's locker room, another small 
storage room that we ended up using for an office.

11:31.762 --> 11:34.265
As we grew, we needed office space. And a very small 
women's restroom. There was no women's shower

11:36.468 --> 11:41.134
facilities on campus at that time. This budget of 
$50,000, that paid salaries. Salaries were

11:45.519 --> 11:46.000
full-time. pay wages for student workers are 
officials primarily. That's.

11:57.958 --> 12:01.402
All so you have to pay for the use of any space. What 
what for space to go use.

12:11.034 --> 12:12.055
At that time we had. probably a softball field. 
Every green space on campus had a softball field.

12:25.306 --> 12:26.627
None of them at that time were lighted.

12:29.911 --> 12:35.818
The area just south of Kyle Field had an astroturf 
racing field that we used that. And the area, the

12:37.160 --> 12:42.987
new, what is now the older of the tennis courts, 
football practice fields in that area. So we had

12:46.161 --> 12:49.225
just south of Kyle Field, four practice fields. Or 
four, three or four that we used. And over on Duncan

12:53.332 --> 13:00.342
Drill Field, which at that time was a side of the 
Bonfire, we used that until the middle of October.

13:00.983 --> 13:05.490
And we probably had eight football fields there at 
one time. We also had an arrangement where we had

13:05.871 --> 13:10.077
about eight softball fields in the spring. We had 
other spaces uh what's now called peakly beach and

13:13.223 --> 13:35.248
there we had two softball fields and we could 
actually put in two ball fields since the drill

13:13.223 --> 13:35.248
field was a drill field back then but we used it 
primarily for sports clubs and even

13:36.680 --> 13:46.754
or any activity that was forbidden in a certain 
place in the intramural?

13:50.298 --> 13:51.160
No. In fact, we used Kyle Field from time to time. We 
didn't use it for games. If we needed lights, if we

13:58.029 --> 14:04.037
started running out of space and time to run 
programs, yeah.

14:10.497 --> 14:26.359
That's a good

14:10.497 --> 14:26.359
point.

14:29.203 --> 14:32.607
When you started out, did anybody give you any 
advice? Do's or don'ts? If so, summarize that.

14:40.889 --> 14:46.399
Carl Landis, Les Palmer, John Corliss, anybody? 
No, not really. As a matter of fact,

14:49.906 --> 15:02.991
I can recall writing a memo to Carl Landis that had 
three or four things that I thought we ought to do at

14:49.906 --> 15:02.991
some point. And I was ready to I'm not sure if I said 
it specifically, but I was really thinking at the

15:04.497 --> 15:13.913
start of the next year that we ought to consider 
doing some of these things and within a month he

15:04.497 --> 15:13.913
said let's start. Either all of them or most of them 
right now, he was ready to go. So to some degree they

15:18.842 --> 15:29.340
were looking for somebody that had brought some 
experience from someplace else and as young as I

15:18.842 --> 15:29.340
was, I did have some pretty good experience 
because Texas probably had the best program in the

15:18.842 --> 15:29.340
country at that time. Did the fact that you had come 
from the University of Texas, did anybody tease

15:29.607 --> 15:34.292
you about it? All the time. All the time. And 
probably one of the better stories, Rooster

15:37.476 --> 15:41.040
Andrews is still alive. He's still over in Austin. 
And he was, he's a sporting goods salesman. And he

15:46.447 --> 15:47.608
sells to schools. And he's got a huge connection 
with the University of Texas. And we had always

15:52.774 --> 15:55.277
purchased stuff from him. His going away present 
to me was about four or five different outfits. And

16:00.004 --> 16:01.166
they're all burnt orange. Although I never wore 
them on campus. I wore them quite a bit when I was

16:05.673 --> 16:09.198
jogging around town and stuff like that. But that 
was a pretty good story. It wasn't until I sent two

16:12.419 --> 16:18.545
kids to Texas A&M that they finally let me be an 
Aggie. Did anybody seriously ever say anything

16:18.565 --> 16:24.111
about your being from UT? No. I think everybody's 
always understood UT's a great school. And the

16:30.297 --> 16:34.541
nice thing that we can say now that Texas A&M is just 
as good. We've made a lot of progress over the

16:35.882 --> 16:38.865
years. We were probably better than we thought we 
were back then, too. At December, I think we had a

16:42.380 --> 16:48.816
little bit of an inferiority complex. We had a 
great school back then, too. And now we know it's

16:51.042 --> 16:53.007
not a problem anymore. I try to work that into 
almost every speech I make about A&M. And I try to do

16:57.404 --> 17:00.990
it at first and see the crowd with their eyes blank. 
And then I try to say, don't you agree with me that

17:01.010 --> 17:07.600
everything they do, we try to outdo them? And says 
yes. And I said, and so therefore, we're both a lot

17:12.848 --> 17:15.352
than we would be if the other one didn't exist. 
Exactly. With this recreation facility, Tom and I

17:16.994 --> 17:28.211
have worked together to make sure we can get our 
administration. We are competitive. We're still

17:29.873 --> 17:30.975
competitive. Right. As a newcomer, describe 
moving into station. Are you living in what it was

17:39.217 --> 17:43.864
like to go to a new place? Well, when I came down here 
for my interview, I really was. And I lived in

17:51.975 --> 17:53.658
Boston for four years. I had no clue where College 
Station was. I made it to College Station one day

17:57.449 --> 18:01.174
and I didn't pull my map out when I got ready to 
leave. I got lost leaving town. Very good, very

18:03.438 --> 18:06.422
good. So I finally I got somewhere in North Bryan 
and I was not on the right track and I had to pull the

18:06.562 --> 18:15.274
map out and figure out where I was and I finally made 
it back to Austin. I moved into College Station. I

18:17.858 --> 18:27.051
lived in a duplex just off of Southwest Parkway and 
in 1973 Southwest Parkway was the start of of the

18:27.537 --> 18:30.300
country. Nothing or almost nothing south of 
Southwest Parkway. There was a few houses, but

18:34.305 --> 18:37.329
very few. That whole area just has exploded with 
growth, and of course, the city at that time was

18:37.349 --> 18:43.676
35,000. The stories were, and they probably were 
true, there was two places where you could go get a

18:44.998 --> 18:56.211
beer in College Station in 1973. a peanut shack on 
Auburn Road, and the other one was Sparky's Pizza

18:56.866 --> 19:02.213
over at Eastgate. And I guess that was true. I can't 
remember any other places at that time where

19:04.095 --> 19:09.822
alcoholic beverages were served at College 
Station. There's a few others in Bryan, but that

19:09.842 --> 19:12.526
was a long way away. Most people lived at College 
Station at that time. But it was a very small town,

19:16.070 --> 19:20.897
about 35,000, very pleasant place to be. The 
school district was great for my kids, and so all of

19:20.937 --> 19:25.202
that was just positive as it could be. And the 
sports programs in this town for kids was probably

19:27.656 --> 19:33.121
the best I'd ever seen. All right, back on the 
campus, what were your goals as you started out?

19:41.410 --> 19:52.101
The, besides DeWare Fieldhouse, at that time we 
had, she brought Dwight, which primarily

19:55.912 --> 20:08.008
There was an addition to G. Raleigh White that had 
three basketball courts and a large locker room

19:55.912 --> 20:08.008
for men.

20:11.953 --> 20:23.488
Another addition to G. Raleigh White, and they 
called it the expansion, they had one large

20:11.953 --> 20:23.488
basketball court and a dance room and an activity 
room, another classroom on the second floor. And

20:24.127 --> 20:28.232
on the main floor, the primary reason the facility 
was built, it had a women's locker room. It was the

20:28.252 --> 20:34.040
first women's locker room for physical activity 
classes on campus ever. And that was the primary

20:35.001 --> 20:37.144
reason the facility was built. In looking at the 
facilities that we had, it was evident to me coming

20:39.627 --> 20:50.742
from the University of Texas that we were behind in 
facilities. Even at that time, I had a vision of

20:52.477 --> 20:56.043
building a reparation facility. It took me about 
22 years to get it done, but we did get it done. And

21:05.719 --> 21:17.860
part of the reason it took so much time, in the late 
70s, this university was growing by as much as

21:05.719 --> 21:17.860
3,000 students every year, and trying to keep pace 
with providing enough activity space for

21:18.127 --> 21:21.713
students to take classes. The primary focus at 
that time was building enough activity space. So

21:26.641 --> 21:31.309
most of the growth went through physical 
education. We were designing physical education

21:31.830 --> 21:36.238
space as opposed to recreation space. And there is 
a small difference and what you can accomplish if

21:38.258 --> 21:42.925
you set out to design recreation space versus 
physical education space. And that's why it took

21:44.368 --> 21:48.554
quite some time to really get around to building 
recreation space. Were there any notable

21:49.135 --> 21:55.025
absences in our facilities, our capabilities, 
when you arrived? Actually, we were able to

21:56.788 --> 21:59.372
accomplish everything we wanted to. Probably the 
biggest drawback we had is the space in G. Riley

21:59.913 --> 22:05.802
White that wasn't air conditioned. But most 
campuses at that time had similar situations.

22:12.215 --> 22:22.849
We all know now, in today's time, that exercising 
in a space that's not air conditioned in the summer

22:12.215 --> 22:22.849
in Texas is very high risk. Back then it was, you 
weren't banned unless you could do that. We know

22:28.657 --> 22:30.800
better than that now. That was probably the only 
thing. We had the right kinds of things, we didn't

22:32.562 --> 22:35.685
necessarily have enough. And of course that was a 
problem because the university went in 1973 from

22:36.065 --> 22:41.571
18,600. In 1985 we were, or 87 when we voted to build 
the rec center, we were about 35,000. Pretty fast

22:51.701 --> 22:52.641
growth. We're just trying to keep up with it, 
especially when teaching physical education

22:53.402 --> 22:58.367
activity classes. is it appropriate for me to 
identify the different activities as sports what

22:58.482 --> 23:27.780
if so describe all the sports that were being uh 
conducted in intramurals when you got here for men

22:58.482 --> 23:27.780
and then for women

22:58.482 --> 23:27.780
we i would probably have to pull out some old which i 
don't think i have in my office here we were At that

23:28.958 --> 23:36.168
time, we had four major sports volleyball, 
softball, like football and basketball.

23:38.552 --> 23:43.239
Plus, track meet in the swimming, and they were 
they were huge. We had 1000 people in the track

23:43.279 --> 23:51.130
meeting and probably 600 in the swimming back at 
that time.

23:51.150 --> 23:54.595
And there were also some other sports like tennis, 
handball, racquetball, some of what you consider

23:56.026 --> 24:00.811
individual and dual sports. I would think we had 
probably ran about 30 tournaments the first year I

24:01.732 --> 24:06.436
was here in those sports. And they were really 
focused on the core. We had teams for leagues for

24:10.800 --> 24:13.663
core. We had leagues for core freshmen. We had 
independent leagues, and we had residence hall

24:16.626 --> 24:19.128
leagues. Shortly, within the next two years, we 
opened that up. to co-rec leagues and women's

24:25.692 --> 24:28.214
leagues. And in the women's we had independent 
leagues and we had residence hall leagues.

24:34.500 --> 24:36.842
Women's residence halls were started by that 
time. What does co-rec mean? Co-rec is where men

24:38.464 --> 24:40.806
and women play on the same team. Such as? They play 
just about everything we do. Football,

24:45.210 --> 24:52.016
basketball, volleyball, softball, soccer, just 
about everything that we do. And the key there is

24:53.357 --> 24:55.159
writing rules that equalized the competition. 
And the co-rec is really a lot more popular than our

24:58.901 --> 25:02.005
women's league. We have more women playing in 
co-rec leagues than we do women's

25:02.025 --> 25:07.772
leagues. Now we're in the neighborhood of 80 
tournaments a year. So we're down from 30 to 80. But

25:15.181 --> 25:24.893
the big change that happened was women's leagues, 
co-rec leagues, and we went from offering one

25:15.181 --> 25:24.893
skill level up to as many as four different skill 
levels. What we're saying is we understand that

25:28.286 --> 25:39.351
there's people on this campus who play varsity and 
probably could play varsity for some colleges

25:28.286 --> 25:39.351
that are playing flag football. There's also 
people like me that still want to play flag

25:39.371 --> 25:44.603
football, but I'd rather not play against 
somebody that's that competitive so i play in

25:44.870 --> 26:13.611
class d if i play and those and class d is 
interesting in class c because you have people

25:44.870 --> 26:13.611
from 18 to 60 playing in those leagues and really 
enjoying it what we what we're trying to

25:44.870 --> 26:13.611
accomplish is an opportunity for everybody 
everybody to play in a competitive sport that

25:44.870 --> 26:13.611
match their interest in competition but not 
everybody wants to to go out there and get hurt

26:14.924 --> 26:19.749
playing against high level competition. Who 
encouraged the women to become more active in

26:19.769 --> 26:24.594
intramurals? Did you and others? Where did the 
drive come from? In reality, most of that came from

26:29.179 --> 26:34.004
the men that played in the programs. And that's why 
the co-reg leagues were so popular. It was another

26:38.929 --> 26:44.155
opportunity for men to participate in 
competitive sports. Even men coach, in reality,

26:44.928 --> 26:52.958
men coach most of the co-rec league teams, and men 
coach most of the women's. Now these are student

26:53.158 --> 26:54.740
men? Yeah. So you'll have somebody from one of the 
men's residence halls, and he'll be coaching a

26:57.143 --> 27:10.159
men's team, then he'll get the co-rec team 
organized, and he'll coach them. And then he may

27:10.510 --> 27:18.022
even coach at, he may be paired with one of the 
women's dorm residence halls on campus, and he may

27:10.510 --> 27:18.022
coach their women's team too. Now in the 70s, was 
that already going on? Yeah, it really got started

27:22.148 --> 27:26.716
in 74, 75 is when it really got going. All right, our 
first women's dorm was January of 71 when Dr.

27:26.736 --> 27:35.810
Williams arrived, so it's that fast. As you were 
getting started here, Are there some people

27:38.202 --> 27:48.456
outside of the Department of Physical Education 
and the College of Education, are there some other

27:38.202 --> 27:48.456
people who were good allies?

27:51.160 --> 27:52.262
Yes, very much so. John Coles, Vice President for 
Student Services. It was shortly, probably in 75

27:57.969 --> 28:03.417
or 76, I started going to his staff meetings. And I 
talked with Carl Landis, and I said, look, we're

28:03.818 --> 28:09.086
being funded by Student Affairs, Student 
Services. John has this meeting, and he's invited

28:10.608 --> 28:13.732
me. It'd probably make a lot of sense for me to be 
there from a funding point of view. The better he

28:19.060 --> 28:21.884
knows us, the more likely he is to fund us. And Carl 
Landis agreed with that. And of course, they and I

28:24.548 --> 28:29.495
started almost a 20-year relationship with Dr. 
Gold. He was very helpful to us along the way.

28:33.721 --> 28:58.227
charles mccandless charles mccandless was the 
director of intramurals in the early 60s when i

28:33.721 --> 28:58.227
knew him he was associate vice president and he had 
responsibilities for facilities on this campus

28:33.721 --> 28:58.227
facility planning for the campus and he was always 
very helpful at a time when when we and physical

28:33.721 --> 28:58.227
education were growing so fast and needing space 
so badly, he was there to champion our cause. He

29:03.655 --> 29:04.295
understood us. He understood what we were doing. 
He was really helpful in that area. Describe the

29:09.803 --> 29:15.590
personalities of Landis and Colas and 
McCandless. Carl Landis

29:16.992 --> 29:22.860
and I are probably quite different. I'm a lot more 
liberal than he is. He's a lot more conservative

29:25.483 --> 29:28.247
than I am in a lot of ways, but In time, and it didn't 
take very long time, we were probably best of

29:28.750 --> 29:32.577
friends. Not only was he a good supervisor, a good 
boss, but we became good friends. Just a great

29:40.772 --> 29:42.135
gentleman. I

29:42.385 --> 29:53.481
can remember one time I got a little frustrated in a 
discussion with him and one of those words came out

29:42.385 --> 29:53.481
and he said, we don't do that in this office. And I 
knew that and I knew from then on that I didn't

29:54.482 --> 30:03.415
become frustrated with him because With Carl, it 
didn't. If you had passion and presented a good

30:08.652 --> 30:20.244
argument, he was going to listen and he was going to 
give you an opportunity to prove yourself right or

30:08.652 --> 30:20.244
wrong. I'm going to make believe that I'm a 
neophyte. Could you count on Carl Landis to keep

30:25.890 --> 30:28.272
his word? 100% of the time. 110% of the time. He's a 
great gentleman. I think that's why I really

30:36.013 --> 30:40.319
appreciate him about as much as anybody I've 
known. Describe

30:40.359 --> 30:47.288
the personality of Colas. John Colas was... 
probably

30:53.277 --> 31:01.187
for A&M and for the profession, an integrator in 
student affairs. It's interesting because he

31:01.788 --> 31:07.515
came from physical education, so he understood 
our business pretty well. He came from physical

31:08.577 --> 31:17.368
education, got started in student affairs at East 
Texas State, now Texas A&M Commerce. So his PhD's

31:17.388 --> 31:21.934
in physical education, but he had a a sense and a 
feeling for our students.
