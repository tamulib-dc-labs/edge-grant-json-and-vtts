00:02.208 --> 00:05.552
Sir, would you state your full name and date and 
place of birth? My name is Robert Burns Bossler and

00:06.112 --> 00:13.460
I was born in Saxton, a little town in 
Pennsylvania, on November 15, 1894. And would you

00:14.541 --> 00:19.607
give your full name and date and place of birth? 
Mary Fisher Bossler, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,

00:20.648 --> 00:28.656
June the 8th, 1891. Thank you. Sir, would you give 
us a brief biographical statement of your early

00:32.431 --> 00:36.717
experiences and education. Include as much as 
you'd like. I was, I was graduated from the

00:39.480 --> 00:45.688
University of Pittsburgh in 1918. I received a 
degree of petroleum engineer. At that time it was a

00:49.753 --> 00:56.582
new degree and I was among the first 12 to receive 
that degree in the United States. He also had the

00:57.541 --> 01:06.616
diploma sent to camp, where he was in service, and 
it is a cum laude degree. It was a cum laude, and as

01:06.736 --> 01:24.645
you said, I was in the, in the May of 1918, I went into 
the Army Engineers, and I came out of that in

01:06.736 --> 01:24.645
December of 1918 as a second lieutenant of 
engineers, so it Well the graduation services

01:24.980 --> 01:27.463
were held in June. I was in camp and they did send the 
diploma to Camp Lee, but I think a lot of these

01:27.583 --> 01:41.142
incidental things are just embroidery, but not 
very vastly important. But after that, after

01:41.743 --> 01:52.557
graduation, I worked in the oil industry and my 
experience covers a wide range of largely in

01:53.414 --> 02:00.220
production and in a department of production 
called secondary recovery. I worked in the

02:01.201 --> 02:21.919
eastern fields and in some of the western fields 
where the field, the particular pools were

02:01.201 --> 02:21.919
exhausted by normal production methods and we 
stimulated the production rate by the injection

02:01.201 --> 02:21.919
of gas or air or water and in many cases we recovered 
in 10-12 years as much as they had recovered by

02:22.405 --> 02:26.328
primary production in 20 or 30 years. So, we did 
right well in the production of crude oil. My

02:33.715 --> 02:39.680
company, the last company I worked for was located 
in Oil City, Pennsylvania. We had operations in

02:40.341 --> 02:50.910
and around that part of Pennsylvania, but also in 
West Virginia and Kentucky and Oklahoma, some

02:51.768 --> 03:12.932
little in Texas, but not much and Kansas, and very 
largely in Kansas and I had a boss who was single and

02:51.768 --> 03:12.932
he was very tax conscious and he had no heirs and he 
wanted, except his nieces and nephews, So he

03:14.144 --> 03:19.389
wanted to liquidate the company, which he 
proceeded to do in a very expert manner. What was

03:19.689 --> 03:21.071
the name of the company? Brundred, 
B-R-U-N-D-R-E-D, Brundred Oil Corporation in

03:21.091 --> 03:26.336
Oil City, Pennsylvania. And in course of the work, 
I had received stock in lieu of salary increases.

03:38.487 --> 03:41.350
During the war, they weren't allowed to increase 
salaries. So to keep everybody happy, they

03:42.781 --> 03:46.785
started giving me stock in the company. So when the 
liquidation occurred, I came out of it with a quite

03:47.606 --> 04:03.724
sizable bunch of stock, which was worth to me a 
fairly large sum of money, but it did terminate the

03:47.606 --> 04:03.724
company. When was this? That was in 1954. And you 
had worked for them how long? Nineteen years.

04:10.231 --> 04:11.252
Nineteen years. And at that time there was a 
position of head of the Pennsylvania Grade Crude

04:11.907 --> 04:36.283
Oil Association Research Laboratory became 
vacant and this was an organization set up to try to

04:11.907 --> 04:36.283
stimulate the recovery of oil from the 
Pennsylvania grade fields. Those are fields

04:36.343 --> 04:41.290
located in New York, Pennsylvania, West Virginia 
and Eastern Ohio. Our job was to try to find ways of

04:42.468 --> 04:53.243
increasing the recovery and this laboratory had 
been going on for a number of years. This position

04:53.303 --> 05:00.433
became vacant and we moved up to Bradford on a 
temporary basis. We kept our home in Oil City and

05:00.473 --> 05:12.289
took an apartment in Bradford and I was there about 
a year, a little over a year, and I got this call from

05:12.792 --> 05:22.404
Mr. Whiting, and a letter from him asked me if I 
would come down and look at the job of teaching here

05:12.792 --> 05:22.404
at Texas A&M. And I came down in October of 55, yeah, 
October of 55, and then in about December, I guess,

05:23.666 --> 05:40.808
I said yes, I would like to come and try it. So I 
arrived in College Station on January 1st, 1956. I

05:45.880 --> 05:59.338
would have arrived December 31st, but I had a 
grandchild born on the night of December 31st

05:45.880 --> 05:59.338
after midnight, actually the first child born in 
the new year. So we stayed there till the daylight

06:00.259 --> 06:06.147
and came on down here on the 1st of January. But I had 
one recollection that I certainly never will

06:06.167 --> 06:11.014
forget because When I got in the Edge of Bryan, I 
called up Bob Whiting and told him where I was and he

06:11.483 --> 06:19.532
told me how to come on ahead. We got over here to the 
East Gate and it was a beautiful warm day, January

06:20.212 --> 06:34.368
1st, and he was standing there in his shirt and 
sleeves and he saw me coming and got the car stopped

06:20.212 --> 06:34.368
and he said, welcome to Texas. And you could hear it 
for a block, you know. It was a marvelous thing to

06:37.191 --> 06:41.355
get a welcome like that. Did you know him from 
someplace before you? No, no. How did he learn of

06:45.691 --> 06:47.433
you? From a Dr. Paul Torrey in Austin and Dr. George 
Fancher. Dr. George Fancher was head of the

06:53.981 --> 07:11.140
department, petroleum department at Austin, the 
University of Texas at Austin and Paul Torrey had

06:53.981 --> 07:11.140
been active in the Pennsylvania great area and we 
had remained in contact through all the years and

07:11.710 --> 07:18.680
Paul Torrey is a very strong supporter and 
advocate of the patrolling department of Texas

07:11.710 --> 07:18.680
A&M. He is giving the department all of his books 
and all of his accumulated library and he's been a

07:19.421 --> 07:41.413
friend of the of the department for for over all 
time and he he told Whiting about me and George

07:19.421 --> 07:41.413
Fancher told Whiting about me and my experience 
and background The position was to teach

07:42.203 --> 08:12.193
petroleum engineering economics and petroleum 
engineering management and my background since I

07:42.203 --> 08:12.193
had come up to, I started out as an engineer and I 
joined the Brunnerdorf Corporation as an

07:42.203 --> 08:12.193
engineer but by the time 1954 came around I was a 
member of the board, secretary of the corporation

07:42.203 --> 08:12.193
and chief engineer and a whole lot of things like 
that and Having reached that level in the company,

08:12.983 --> 08:42.315
I had a great deal of experience in wheeling and 
dealing and accumulating land and disposing of

08:12.983 --> 08:42.315
land and made a considerable study of oil company 
taxation problems and in connection with the

08:12.983 --> 08:42.315
liquidation of the corporation, we had to do a 
great deal of groundwork in discovering the

08:43.105 --> 08:47.650
methods that would result in the least taxation. 
So that my background in these various phases made

08:48.651 --> 09:04.207
me, I say in all modesty, it made me quite well 
prepared for that particular area of teaching.

09:04.568 --> 09:06.630
This was to be your first teaching experience? 
Yeah, this was the first teaching experience. Did

09:08.311 --> 09:11.695
you approach this with any apprehension? to 
teaching? Indeed I did. They did this for me. They

09:17.507 --> 09:21.074
had 64 seniors. I taught seniors and I had a great 
regard for petroleum engineering seniors and I

09:22.376 --> 09:34.459
had in certain areas, I hadn't cracked a book in 30 
years. I, you talk about the word trepidation, I

09:35.080 --> 09:39.125
was it all over. What, could you give me an idea of 
what made you decide to come to Texas, even though

09:39.765 --> 09:47.715
you had the letter and what made you decide to 
finally come to Texas? Had you ever been here

09:47.755 --> 09:48.996
before? Yeah, I had been in Texas in connection 
with the war, but I'd never been to Texas A&M. I'd

09:53.481 --> 09:56.064
never been to College Station. No, there's 
another factor to the matter. John Calhoun was

09:59.028 --> 10:04.294
then, well he was the Head of the petroleum 
engineering department at State College,

10:04.713 --> 10:10.340
Pennsylvania State College. And then he came down 
to Texas as- You had taken some graduate work with

10:11.902 --> 10:17.208
him. I had taken some work with John Calhoun at 
State College. I see. And he was down here, he first

10:21.453 --> 10:29.223
came down here as dean of engineering and then he 
moved on to something else and he's up there as a

10:21.453 --> 10:29.223
vice president now. Yes. But he was here.

10:34.193 --> 10:43.263
Well I felt that I wanted to teach but I wanted to do 
something for the industry and this looked like a

10:34.193 --> 10:43.263
good way to do it. The industry had been pretty darn 
good to me and I felt that if there was some way and

10:43.284 --> 11:02.766
this looked like a very beautiful opportunity 
where I could by teaching students and passing on

10:43.284 --> 11:02.766
some of my experience and background and general 
philosophy that I could do a little good. I wish you

11:08.547 --> 11:10.089
could have heard it. Yesterday afternoon, a young 
fellow, we were at a wedding, and this boy was also a

11:10.169 --> 11:30.610
guest, and he came up and spoke to Bob by name and 
thanked him for what he had learned from him at

11:10.169 --> 11:30.610
school and told how the various things that he had 
told them that they had gotten together and

11:30.978 --> 11:39.528
discussed them for two weeks. This was a special 
talk I'd given to one group after I'd quit

11:40.189 --> 11:45.275
teaching. Of course, that made us both beam. I 
think so. That's marvelous. That's one of the big

11:50.361 --> 11:52.804
satisfactions I've had. It's a real dividend. 
I've had a couple of those. But there aren't very

11:57.927 --> 11:59.549
many of them. But this was completely out of blue 
sky. There we were at this wedding yesterday, and

12:01.491 --> 12:11.441
the boy comes up and asked if I was Mr. Bossler. He 
said his name was Garcia. And I had made him a talk

12:14.103 --> 12:17.046
someplace, and I don't recall where it was. But he 
said, we talked and we discussed what you said for

12:18.348 --> 12:26.136
two weeks after you were there. I must have made 
some sort of an impression. Could you tell me what

12:28.201 --> 12:33.628
your first impressions or recollections are of 
the school when you first got here, what you

12:28.201 --> 12:33.628
thought? Well, the school was in a little bit of 
upheaval because of Dr. Morgan because he was

12:35.570 --> 12:54.394
advocating voluntary military and he was 
advocating departure from some of the quote

12:35.570 --> 12:54.394
traditions we have around here and He was not very 
popular and things were a bit of an uproar, but I was

12:54.644 --> 12:59.591
not in contact. One of the first people that 
Whiting took me to meet was Dr. Morgan and I was

13:00.252 --> 13:14.072
greatly impressed because he was a very pleasant 
and knowledgeable man and I'm sure he was quite

13:00.252 --> 13:14.072
able man judging from the jobs he's held since. But 
my impressions were pretty solidly related to the

13:15.414 --> 13:22.103
department. because I just had to buckle right 
down and learn and relearn and unlearn a lot of

13:22.825 --> 13:43.935
things that I had acquired over the lifetime and 
try to come up to date and try to do a good job and I

13:22.825 --> 13:43.935
think I did, but it took an awful awful lot of work. I 
just come home from school with my head down and my

13:44.075 --> 13:49.963
feet flat on the floor from there Midnight and the 
next day the same and I had to I had to get my, they

13:50.028 --> 13:59.018
gave me a month. I came in January 1st and class 
started February 1st so I had a month to get my feet

13:59.138 --> 14:05.045
on the floor. But the impression of the department 
is something I really feel great about and I like to

14:05.065 --> 14:17.959
tell about it because in the entire period that I 
was there I never heard one member of the faculty

14:18.428 --> 14:25.375
make a derogatory remark about another one, 
privately or publicly or anything else. You know

14:25.415 --> 14:30.680
in many departments in the company where I was, 
this was certainly not so. There was backbiting

14:30.740 --> 14:45.955
and infighting and there was that squabbling of 
galore and but here at the department, honest to

14:30.740 --> 14:45.955
John, nobody ever said anything to me about 
another member that they wouldn't say to their

14:46.643 --> 14:48.865
face, you know. And it was just so, so different 
from what it was in the company, that it made a deep

14:48.885 --> 14:56.953
and certainly lasting impression on me. And all 
the while I was there, nobody ever said anything.

15:03.138 --> 15:15.790
And it could easily have been done, because we had 
some PhDs and we had some that were just BS's and I

15:03.138 --> 15:15.790
just had equivalent of a BS, and yet If I run into a 
problem, some of them my mathematics were rusty as

15:16.715 --> 15:32.695
could be, I run into a problem and they were, 
practically everybody from whiting down would

15:16.715 --> 15:32.695
just drop what they were doing and clarify the 
thing for me. The most sympathetic was Paul

15:33.736 --> 15:41.926
Crawford and Bill Hammocks. Dan Bass was an 
extremely brilliant young man. and he could make

15:45.908 --> 16:00.371
these giant strides in mathematics and I just 
couldn't follow, but Bill Amex, Paul Crawford

15:45.908 --> 16:00.371
would sit down and go through it step by step by step 
by step and show me the way. I always appreciated

16:00.391 --> 16:03.456
that very much. Unfortunately, Bill Amex died and 
Dan Bass moved out to Colorado School of Mines

16:10.799 --> 16:14.164
Whiting was very patient and very, very good 
instructor. He was just great when he would take

16:14.184 --> 16:19.652
the time to explain something. And he gave me lots 
of leeway. He said, when you're in that classroom,

16:22.997 --> 16:26.883
it's yours. He said, don't ask me what to do. It's 
your job. I said, I'm not telling you what to do. So

16:34.113 --> 16:35.636
we got along real good. The books, he had the 
seniors prepare At the end of the term,

16:41.309 --> 17:03.891
I overheard one man telling another that that book 
would be, that treatise, that subject that he had

16:41.309 --> 17:03.891
been working on, was worthy of a Ph.D., Oh no, it 
wasn't PhD work, but it was pretty good work. We had

17:08.419 --> 17:14.706
an annual report we had to make, and I'd give them a 
problem on property evaluation. I'd give them the

17:14.847 --> 17:17.449
raw data and say, what's the property worth?

17:21.314 --> 17:25.438
We got values that varied two or three hundred 
percent, but it didn't worry me at all. I said, all I

17:25.458 --> 17:30.604
want to know is whether you have the method, 
whether you know the procedures. your absolute

17:31.124 --> 17:46.621
answer isn't greatly important to me, unless it's 
200 million or something like that, which is

17:31.124 --> 17:46.621
utterly absurd, but they, all I was asked, and they 
put them up in hardback binding, you know, and they

17:31.124 --> 17:46.621
were very proud. That passes a dissertation. They 
were so valuable that some of the good ones were

17:48.684 --> 18:00.557
actually stolen by some of the people who wanted to 
have them in their life. library. They stole the

18:01.543 --> 18:03.246
Goodman. I was kind of simple-minded. I didn't 
hand them back, this is yours and this is yours and

18:05.830 --> 18:09.195
this is yours. I put them out on the table and told 
them to pick theirs up and tell them what they

18:09.215 --> 18:13.722
picked up. Picked up the Goodman's and the man who 
had produced the Goodman's, he came to me and said,

18:15.245 --> 18:23.798
mine's gone. All I could leave was sorrow. But be 
that as may, the department was a very closely

18:25.462 --> 18:39.396
knit, cohesive group, and I pretty much drowned in 
coffee the first couple of months, because

18:25.462 --> 18:39.396
Whiting would say, let's go have a cup of coffee. 
Well, he was saying, well, let's go have a faculty

18:39.416 --> 18:54.912
meeting, and they'd do it over a cup of coffee, and 
he discussed all the faculty problems, and he'd

18:39.416 --> 18:54.912
sometimes have an agenda that long accomplish 
over a cup of coffee, and I'd say, you're never

18:55.111 --> 19:02.539
going to finish that, and he said, what do you bet? 
But it was very, very closely knit, cohesive

19:02.679 --> 19:17.315
group, and everybody knew what was going on 
because of this, and everybody had a part in what

19:02.679 --> 19:17.315
was going on, and it was a very marvelous 
department. I think there's no department on the

19:17.335 --> 19:22.021
campus anywhere, anytime, ever equal to that. You 
talked of... President Morgan's problems and the

19:25.283 --> 19:27.947
upheaval. Could you tell us whether the 
resentment against him was from the students or

19:28.367 --> 19:35.336
the faculty or the exes? My understanding is it 
came from the exes and the board of directors. Who

19:42.766 --> 19:44.449
were exes anyway. Huh? Who were probably exes 
anyway. Yeah.

19:50.657 --> 19:53.401
Many things he stood for happen now. I didn't know 
many of the students. I didn't know very many of the

19:57.736 --> 20:04.663
faculty, but my feeling was conveyed to me in my own 
impressions. There was very little trouble

20:05.484 --> 20:09.709
underneath. It all came from above.

20:14.955 --> 20:18.058
Ms. Bosser, could you tell us your first 
impressions on arriving here? Oh my. Yes. The lady

20:24.194 --> 20:43.411
that came to our motel, Bob Whiting had arranged 
for us to stay until we found a place, came to pick me

20:24.194 --> 20:43.411
up and had a pansy that grew in her front yard in her 
collar. And that made a big impression on me. Did

20:48.215 --> 20:50.056
you find the people friendly to you? Very 
friendly. My next door neighbor came in and I have

20:54.721 --> 21:24.272
some little old cookies and one way come in for a cup 
of coffee and found out that she belonged to the

20:54.721 --> 21:24.272
same church that I had belonged to as a Methodist 
and said that the ladies were having a meeting the

20:54.721 --> 21:24.272
next night and could I go along and I got acquainted 
with friends that are still good warm friends

20:54.721 --> 21:24.272
right now they uh Very, very pleasant. She hunted 
houses, and she'd go out with a real estate dealer

21:28.542 --> 21:37.374
and line up three or four, and after school I'd go 
out.

21:40.798 --> 21:41.279
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh. Finally, we came to this one. 
We had been living in an apartment. Our home was in

21:46.086 --> 21:50.431
Oil City, but it was a furnished apartment. I had to 
have my cooking utensils and dishes and bed linen

21:53.513 --> 21:56.958
and so forth. And we just had that packed in our car. 
And she found us a rented furnished apartment here

22:00.222 --> 22:10.336
that was available to people that owned it were in 
California. And that was down on Gilchrist Street

22:11.377 --> 22:19.509
in North Gilchrist. And then she was the one then 
that was interested in finding a permanent home.

22:25.466 --> 22:28.289
She knew that was temporary. And 1st of March,

22:28.309 --> 22:35.998
by the 1st of March, we knew we were going to live 
here. I think we moved in the 1st of April. 1st of

22:39.722 --> 22:41.263
March. 1st of March we moved in? Yeah, we moved in 
the 1st of March. January, February, we were

22:45.488 --> 22:46.369
hunting houses. I came and saw this when it was 
occupied. It had been built about six months

22:49.410 --> 22:56.442
before we got here, October or so, the year before, 
55.

22:59.808 --> 23:02.913
I saw this and the trees and the possibilities. It 
was raw mud and no driveway, no patio, no nothing.

23:08.002 --> 23:13.251
And the mailbox was in a tree that stood in the 
middle of the street out here. The page just paved

23:15.374 --> 23:19.118
around the tree, I think. But when we walked out of 
it, I said, this is what we want. So we were very

23:22.822 --> 23:26.426
happy with everything. Of course, there weren't 
as many houses available then as there are now to

23:26.446 --> 23:30.631
look at. Oh, it was a terrible search. Well, there 
were quite a few to look at, though. And I'm still

23:35.997 --> 23:41.483
very glad that we didn't take any of the rest of 
them. It's a nice place. It's a marvelous place,

23:43.718 --> 23:46.901
and its trees are worth a fortune. Yeah. There were 
40 trees on the lot. And then the lot next door was

23:51.304 --> 23:58.911
unoccupied, of course. And some people had gotten 
an architect to draw up plans to build a house on

23:59.671 --> 24:06.997
that. It's comparatively a narrower lot. I think 
90 feet was all. And that would put a driveway right

24:13.171 --> 24:20.241
up by these windows. So we turned around, bought 
that lot, and later sold half of it. So

24:25.830 --> 24:31.037
it gave us a lot more trees. I haven't any idea now 
just how many trees we're doing. The edge of the

24:34.362 --> 24:38.689
property is about 60 feet from that roof line 
there. Well, the trees shade your house. Should

24:43.310 --> 24:45.593
keep your air conditioning bill down a little bit. 
That's right. We have a smaller air conditioner

24:46.514 --> 24:56.466
than this house and the glass and so on would 
require because we are shaded, and it's a big

24:46.514 --> 24:56.466
asset. Now you've talked about some of the people 
you were closely associated with. Could you

25:00.031 --> 25:02.274
mention any more? Mention the people in your 
department. Well, there was Amex, Bass, and

25:03.775 --> 25:05.938
Whiting. They had just written a book. And then 
there was John Pettigo. and Harvey Kennedy.

25:14.083 --> 25:19.547
Harvey Kennedy was a distinguished professor who 
came down here from the Gulf Research Laboratory

25:14.083 --> 25:19.547
in Pittsburgh. He was exclusively for graduate 
students and some seniors. He was a very fine, very

25:27.574 --> 25:29.676
able man. He made a lasting impression on a lot of 
students. I got into the graduate student

25:33.599 --> 25:37.883
business that first spring. I had some graduate 
students too. They said that was a greater honor

25:41.512 --> 25:45.818
than being in the Sigma Psi. That's all there was at 
that time. And Dr.

25:48.782 --> 25:56.293
Kennedy and myself. I mentioned Bass. And then 
later we got Hank Ramey and he left and Joe Ossaba

25:59.417 --> 26:11.434
and then Bill McGuire came and Doug 
Vaughn-Gaunton. I had him as an undergraduate

26:16.725 --> 26:21.270
student and some graduate courses. Now he's back 
with a Ph.D. teaching and he's doing very well.

26:26.915 --> 26:33.061
Pretty much assistant to Bob Whiting, I think, in 
most of the things. But that's all the people that

26:33.082 --> 26:37.085
have been in the department. Oh, we had another 
called him a schlock, S-C-H-L-A-U-D-T. I had him

26:42.569 --> 26:51.743
as an undergraduate and then some graduate 
courses and he stayed on and got his Ph.D. but then

26:42.569 --> 26:51.743
he went out to work for Shell. Apparently doing all 
right there. He looked like a permanent student,

26:55.389 --> 27:00.777
you know, he was around there for about eight years 
or nine. Who would you recall outside of the

27:01.702 --> 27:04.466
department? Any other people you might have been 
closely associated with outside the department

27:04.486 --> 27:11.515
that you recall?

27:11.936 --> 27:18.985
Well, yes, there's some people in the allied 
disciplines. Geology, for instance. There was

27:20.547 --> 27:25.413
Shirley Lynch, head of the department, head of the 
department, head of the geology department. And

27:26.355 --> 27:31.101
Parker, Travis Parker and Clay Seward and Horace

27:31.233 --> 27:36.961
Blank was just about to retire.

27:39.866 --> 27:49.079
He has since retired, and I've been quite close to 
him ever since retirement because we have a mutual

27:39.866 --> 27:49.079
interest in the Gem and Minerals Club. As

27:50.441 --> 28:00.396
far as his retiring is concerned, when he reached 
the age to retire, they... board of directors

28:00.663 --> 28:09.451
voted an extra year for him, and then the next June, 
there's still another year. Well, they couldn't

28:10.032 --> 28:22.324
after that, so when they needed him again, it was a 
distinguished professor for a while, but he had a

28:10.032 --> 28:22.324
hard time retiring. Yeah, I was officially 
retired and went up on the stage, you know, and got

28:22.344 --> 28:28.830
the little certificate, and then Whiting was 
teaching my courses and he got into a crack with

28:29.553 --> 28:38.102
some other work that he was doing and would I come 
back that spring of 63. That was after your second

28:38.202 --> 28:41.966
retirement. Spring of 63 and teach my old course 
again. I actually taught an extra semester after I

28:47.612 --> 28:52.477
graduated. After I retired. I guess in other 
departments, J.G. McGuire, his neighbor over

29:02.913 --> 29:08.540
here, and he's the associate dean of engineering 
now. He was another one that I felt acquainted

29:08.580 --> 29:12.345
with. By the way, he was a voted emeritus. Yeah, I 
had an emeritus status.

29:23.485 --> 29:32.959
What were some of the more outstanding problems 
and situations which confronted you or were

29:23.485 --> 29:32.959
confronted by you or by the college during your 
association with it? Well, the problem

29:33.600 --> 29:49.324
confronting me was to equip myself to teach those 
boys and prepare an outline for the course and then

29:33.600 --> 29:49.324
accumulate the the teaching materials and so on 
that I had to have for the course. That was the

29:53.399 --> 29:57.183
outstanding problem the first year. Of course, I 
rewrote the course outline and the course

29:57.223 --> 30:19.547
notebook I think about three times in the five 
years that I, five or six years I was teaching, but

29:57.223 --> 30:19.547
the first one was to come in from industry and start 
teaching and do a credible job and earn my money.

30:19.865 --> 30:35.953
And to give the boys 60 minutes worth of time each 
hour, I say I was so busy doing that I had very little

30:19.865 --> 30:35.953
contact with what was going on outside of the 
department.

30:39.800 --> 30:44.708
What do you regard as the more important 
accomplishments of A&M Beringer Association?

30:47.270 --> 30:52.556
Oh, I would say first growth, but I think that 
growth should follow something else. I think that

30:52.656 --> 31:14.080
the accomplishment that brought about the growth 
was the de-accenting the military and making it

30:52.656 --> 31:14.080
voluntary and the opening up the schools to the 
colored and opening up the schools to the women.

31:14.420 --> 31:16.703
When we were first here, we had a big problem. There 
was some Sigma Xi owners that belonged to Sigma Xi

31:19.150 --> 31:36.271
Scientific Society or Research Society down at

31:19.150 --> 31:36.271
Prairie View. What would we do if they came up here 
to a meeting because they were probably, there was

31:36.572 --> 31:41.458
just no provision for anything. A colored man come 
here to sing and he couldn't stay in the MSC. He

31:49.898 --> 31:52.061
couldn't get his hair cut here in this town. He just 
had a horrible time and I certainly give old LBJ

31:53.023 --> 32:09.447
credit because one time he was scheduled to come 
here and he said if there's going to be any trouble

31:53.023 --> 32:09.447
with the blacks or any trouble at all, just count me 
out. He said I want to see some black people there.

32:12.792 --> 32:14.595
and that's when it opened up.

32:19.042 --> 32:31.000
Early graduation services, you'd see two or three 
back rows in the back of the G. Raleigh White and

32:19.042 --> 32:31.000
that's where the few colored people sat. That's 
where they stayed. They came in and sat down. The

32:35.968 --> 32:38.412
basketball games, they had to stay up. In our own 
section. Even a public performance like a

32:41.496 --> 33:05.884
basketball game, they had to go clear way back up 
there in the back and LBJ said, there'll be none of

32:41.496 --> 33:05.884
that and if you want me to come, of course it was 
understood that if he canceled out for some reason

32:41.496 --> 33:05.884
like that, it was going to be a lot of, a lot of fuss 
and feathers about why he canceled out So, I think

33:06.505 --> 33:21.601
that his influence was largely, very largely, his 
influence contributed largely to the admission

33:06.505 --> 33:21.601
of colored and minority groups. We always had 
Spanish, we always had Spanish, there was lots of

33:22.041 --> 33:35.415
them here, but colored, no, until about the time I 
was leaving here, leaving the campus. And those

33:36.863 --> 33:52.579
things,

33:36.863 --> 33:52.579
de-accenting the military and the admission of 
the colored and the admission of women, I think

33:36.863 --> 33:52.579
that has resulted in the growth. Also, I think that 
being a state institution and by some hook or

33:52.599 --> 34:06.212
crook, they've managed to keep fees, fees and 
tuition low, so a lot of people can come here, even,

34:07.036 --> 34:25.656
even they can come, out-of-state boys can come 
here at less expense than they can go to their own,

34:07.036 --> 34:25.656
within their own states, and these things have 
resulted in attracting a lot of people here. They,

34:25.676 --> 34:35.507
of course, the greatest, the greatest thing, of 
course, is the absolute magnificent influx of

34:36.685 --> 34:41.210
minds and researchers and scholars that have been 
encouraged to come here. The level of scholarship

34:42.351 --> 34:54.163
among the faculty is really great and it has been 
growing and been improving. It's far and away

34:54.203 --> 34:57.847
above the level it was in 56. Far and away above the 
level it was when I came here with the addition of

34:59.789 --> 35:05.815
these these scholars, scholarly people, 
researchers, specialists in their line, that to

35:06.487 --> 35:19.500
my mind has been even more outstanding than the 
numbers.

35:22.103 --> 35:34.536
The numbers are very gratifying, but I think the 
level of scholarship among the faculty, and just

35:22.103 --> 35:34.536
to see the list of the papers, it is fortnightly 
that passed around here. the list of subjects that

35:34.955 --> 35:44.605
are being published and researched and the honors 
that are acquired by the faculty. It's really a

35:44.625 --> 35:48.389
marvelous thing. I don't know too much about many 
other faculty campuses, but certainly been a very

35:48.469 --> 36:01.182
great improvement in that area. Do you think maybe 
we could, we might be carrying growth a little too

36:02.123 --> 36:05.488
far? They're estimating 22,000 next fall. I 
certainly think there's a definite limit to how

36:09.153 --> 36:19.767
big we want to be, how big we should be, and I think 
we're getting there pretty darn rapidly. I

36:19.787 --> 36:25.395
couldn't see this continuous growth, 30, 40, 
50,000. That's utterly beyond I think it should be

36:30.828 --> 36:33.792
divided up into smaller schools. You become too 
machine-like, too...

36:35.334 --> 36:50.512
the pupil-professor, pupil-teacher 
relationships can't exist when you get too big. I

36:50.793 --> 36:53.516
wish it would stop now. I wish it would stop sooner. 
I think it's big enough. I think many people, I

36:57.141 --> 36:59.063
found this in With many of the interviews I've done 
already, people think that we're big enough,

36:59.920 --> 37:05.367
maybe a little bigger than we ought to be. Yeah, 
because the people relationship to the faculty,

37:05.387 --> 37:15.980
it just can't possibly be where there's so many 
people. What do you feel were some of the greatest

37:17.622 --> 37:26.873
weaknesses or failures, lost opportunities or 
misdirections of the university during your

37:17.622 --> 37:26.873
association with it? I just had nothing to say on 
that because as I say I had my nose to grindstone and

37:28.608 --> 37:45.534
so concerned with the departmental affairs that I 
had no... Would you say possibly losing Dr. Morgan

37:28.608 --> 37:45.534
might have set us back? It did in the mind of some of 
us set us back. 10 or 15 years. Well I think the

37:52.745 --> 37:57.012
things that he was advocating have now come into 
being and if he had received the same support that

37:57.633 --> 38:01.117
others have since.

38:06.302 --> 38:26.965
Rudder was a great man and he did a great many things 
for the university but it took him a long time, a

38:06.302 --> 38:26.965
long time to come around to some of the things that 
Morgan had already arrived at and if he had

38:06.302 --> 38:26.965
received the same support that Rudder received 
later, he probably would have moved along faster.

38:29.273 --> 38:34.260
And what do you regard as some of the more 
outstanding changes that have occurred at Texas

38:29.273 --> 38:34.260
A&M? Well, size and numbers and of course things 
that I've already mentioned about women and

38:36.383 --> 38:48.259
blacks and military. Now when did you retire? Well 
I officially retired in 62 and then as I say I was

38:52.065 --> 38:58.774
called back in spring of 63 to to teach my course all 
over again. You've been quite active since you did

39:02.226 --> 39:06.791
retire in doing many things. Could you give us kind 
of a chronological description of your

39:06.851 --> 39:11.736
activities since you retired? Well the first 
couple years we felt that we had earned some time so

39:12.476 --> 39:19.243
we did some visiting. We went to India and Japan and 
the Middle East and so on and we had a son living in

39:19.263 --> 39:29.453
Canada so we traveled a great deal over Canada and 
Mexico and just really traveled around a bit and

39:30.192 --> 39:58.663
then I had a little health problem in in 68 and 
January 69 and had an operation and about that time

39:30.192 --> 39:58.663
the Brazos County Community Council was formed 
actually formed in June of 68 but I didn't become

39:59.015 --> 40:12.074
interested in it much until after I recovered a bit 
from my operation in the spring of 69 and it was one

39:59.015 --> 40:12.074
of these things that was well conceived. To my mind 
it needed something that would keep it going, some

40:12.134 --> 40:19.385
activity, day by day activity. I don't think you 
can keep a group together and just hold a monthly

40:20.126 --> 40:27.857
meeting or a quarterly meeting and talk about 
things and then don't do anything. So I said we

40:28.428 --> 40:32.594
ought to have an information referral office. I 
had been following one of these things in Kansas

40:32.614 --> 40:57.068
City area and knew a good deal about what they did 
and so on and it was apparent that there was a great

40:32.614 --> 40:57.068
many people in this area in the lower income sector 
and in the poverty sector that had problems for

40:57.470 --> 41:02.956
which they couldn't provide a solution and they 
didn't know where to go to find a solution. They

41:03.717 --> 41:18.074
needed a center to which they could come and 
describe their problems or sit, there'd be

41:03.717 --> 41:18.074
somebody to sit down with them and talk and after a 
while you would identify what the real problem

41:03.717 --> 41:18.074
was. They may have said they need money but they had 
a problem with it but they didn't know how to manage

41:18.355 --> 41:24.642
money or that they had too many kids and hence they 
always needed money or a number of reasons why they

41:24.892 --> 41:45.685
didn't have enough money but then there were 
problems of every sort and description and there

41:24.892 --> 41:45.685
were problems for which there were agencies 
already in existence the word information and

41:46.154 --> 42:16.127
referral the referral part of it of course refers 
to the fact that we would refer people after we

41:46.154 --> 42:16.127
identified a problem we would refer people to the 
welfare the Bryan City Mission or the Salvation

41:46.154 --> 42:16.127
Army or the rehabilitation whatever it was it was 
set up to work on that particular problem the

41:46.154 --> 42:16.127
information was to accumulate a vast reservoir of 
information regarding all of the social agencies

42:16.563 --> 42:45.034
in the area what to do and what their telephone 
numbers are and the people who run them and so it was

42:16.563 --> 42:45.034
to be able to make a proper referral because no use 
in my sending somebody to social security if it

42:16.563 --> 42:45.034
isn't a social security problem and likewise 
welfare or rehabilitation or anything else I had

42:16.563 --> 42:45.034
to know what these various agencies do So I had to 
accumulate the information and instead of

42:46.077 --> 42:55.066
keeping it to myself, we published it as a 
directory of social services. And we're working

42:56.968 --> 43:04.175
now on our fourth one, which means that we're just 
constantly updating these directories of social

42:56.968 --> 43:04.175
service. Well, the

43:04.855 --> 43:14.785
main object, in a few words, the purpose of the 
Brazos County Community Council occupied about

43:15.372 --> 43:18.916
that much in the Constitution. But I can express it 
in a few words that the purpose of the Bradley

43:19.657 --> 43:28.728
County Community Council was to find unfilled 
needs in the area and do something about it. And

43:29.749 --> 43:34.334
also look for duplication and overlap, but that 
was not a serious problem. But to find the unfilled

43:34.354 --> 43:44.586
needs, well, I felt that the information referral 
office was an unfilled need and we did something

43:34.354 --> 43:44.586
about it. Then there was a need for transportation 
among the poor people who can't get to a doctor or

43:45.815 --> 43:56.131
can't get to a hospital or can't get to groceries or 
can't cash their checks or anything. So we set up a

43:56.672 --> 44:09.291
roadrunner service and since we had room in our 
office we said we'll try to run it and now we have a

43:56.672 --> 44:09.291
man who does nothing but scheduled roadrunner 
calls and called the roadrunners, and that's all

44:10.486 --> 44:15.410
he does. Three hours a day, five days a week. He's 
also a volunteer. He is also a volunteer. And then

44:21.256 --> 44:25.359
we had a thing we thought was needed, but 
apparently it wasn't. It was a telephone

44:25.379 --> 44:32.005
reassurance service for people who are homebound 
or housebound or in a wheelchair or something. We

44:32.445 --> 44:39.532
thought it would be nice if somebody called them up 
every day to ask them how they were and whether they

44:32.445 --> 44:39.532
were getting along all right, whether they needed 
anything. Certainly. But we found many more

44:40.388 --> 44:48.238
people willing to do the calling than we did people 
who wanted to be called, so this kind of blew up. But

44:48.399 --> 45:07.123
then we, then the summer of 62, no 72, we were asked 
by the Governor's Committee on Aging, that is the

44:48.399 --> 45:07.123
Bradley County Community Council was asked, if we 
would sponsor a thing called the Retired Senior

44:48.399 --> 45:07.123
Volunteer Program. And we demonstrated to them 
that we were capable of doing this, and they said,

45:11.928 --> 45:16.333
all right, you're it. So now the Braddock County 
Community Council, considering it as a holding

45:17.314 --> 45:36.596
company or overriding company, we have one 
operating group, the Information Referral, and

45:17.314 --> 45:36.596
another operating group, the Road Runners, and 
another operating group, the RSVP. That's what

45:36.856 --> 45:39.319
I've been doing about Oh, 15, 20 hours a week now for 
about five years. Excuse me. Now, this might be

45:45.358 --> 45:48.362
someone needing a ride to Galveston. Yes, maybe. 
Some of my clients have. But that's what I do, but I

45:51.908 --> 45:58.056
have a couple of other things that I'm vastly 
interested in. The major one, of course, is the

45:58.077 --> 46:01.261
Junior Museum of Natural History. This is a going 
thing. I wanted it for a while, and... have a number

46:09.370 --> 46:12.174
of exhibits over there. We have a lot of artifacts 
and rocks and minerals and birds and ducks and all

46:12.214 --> 46:26.957
sorts of things, but the major thrust of the museum 
is education of the children in nature and

46:12.214 --> 46:26.957
science.
