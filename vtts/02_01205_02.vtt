WEBVTT

00:01.533 --> 00:15.852
Yes, it was great, but I just think, you know, I go to 
bed at night sometimes, I just think how wonderful

00:01.533 --> 00:15.852
it's going to be that he's still alive and vigorous 
and can have interchanges with our society. Yeah,

00:15.872 --> 00:16.373
yeah. And that's what he's going to do. He likes to 
come on the quids of the library. Right. And he has

00:21.179 --> 00:23.322
come to settle in here. Well, he really does love 
it. He likes it, that's right. Yeah, he does. He

00:29.169 --> 00:31.252
does have a nice place to stay, too. Yeah. So, 
November's dedication. November 5th

00:34.756 --> 00:40.904
and 6th. What impact do you think, this is a very 
broad closing comment, what impact do you think

00:41.325 --> 00:52.819
the press has, what they have, what have been its 
high points, low points, what do you see as... Is it

00:53.879 --> 00:55.902
in trouble? No, I don't think so.

01:02.050 --> 01:05.555
You know, I don't really see low points. I guess 
maybe I'm an optimist. But I see nothing but high

01:08.459 --> 01:12.625
points in the West. And I have not ever been 
discouraged. We've had the people, most of our

01:15.809 --> 01:23.700
presidents have been interested in the press and 
have carried it forward. I guess we had one

01:28.784 --> 01:33.533
president that wasn't so interested. That's all 
right. But we managed to, if there was a low point, I

01:35.436 --> 01:39.664
guess maybe that was it. But that was a little 
discouraging at times. He didn't do anything to

01:45.095 --> 01:46.857
hurt us. He didn't do anything to help us, but he 
didn't do anything to hurt us. And now we've got

01:49.801 --> 01:58.152
Bowen who gives away books at our luncheons every 
day and every football game. And those are

01:58.172 --> 02:00.435
wonderful things. And that's kind of what I 
envision.

02:07.945 --> 02:12.992
Those things, those books have Texas A&M on them 
and they're in people's bookshelves and

02:07.945 --> 02:12.992
libraries forever. You know, that was one of 
Frank's letters, and in that Type 22 article he

02:13.360 --> 02:23.117
did, he carefully explained why a press is 
important at the University of New York. Right.

02:23.878 --> 02:26.703
And I think that needs to be reiterated over and 
over again. I do, too. That's one of the things I

02:27.264 --> 02:29.989
hope to do with this book. Right. I agree with you. 
Because it is a, they are wonderful things that,

02:32.753 --> 02:35.959
you know, People, I envy people that read more than 
I do, and most people do. Because they do, they just

02:43.561 --> 02:47.306
get a lot out of life. But it's very, it's just 
wonderful that they do. Do you think the, in terms

02:53.996 --> 02:57.762
of, this is really up your ball, In terms of the 
kinds of books we publish, are you satisfied? Yes.

03:02.776 --> 03:03.457
Oh, yeah. I'm very, very pleased with what we've 
published. You think Frank is still right on with

03:06.243 --> 03:09.670
the regional Texas thrust? Yeah, I do. And I think 
he'd be very proud of our selection every year. I

03:13.958 --> 03:18.162
can't think of a single year that he wouldn't have 
been proud of. That's why I'm really trying to get

03:18.182 --> 03:25.688
this down very tightly in the early phase because I 
think whatever he's set down, that's the way it's

03:18.182 --> 03:25.688
been. It really is. I think so too. It's fallen 
through very, very much. I think so too. We're

03:32.014 --> 03:33.675
proud of all of our authors. Isn't our friend Frank 
Vandiver? Yes. He's got another book coming. Have

03:40.421 --> 03:41.522
you seen his book yet? No, I have not. I use Frank's 
book, Blood Brothers, I guess, in my classes. I've

03:47.003 --> 03:50.789
got two of these big survey classes. 350 students 
in one, 150 in the other. I use Frank's Blood

03:54.194 --> 03:58.620
Brothers. I used to ask him to come in and lecture. 
He loves to, but now he's got a tape. Oh, really? Oh,

04:06.111 --> 04:07.393
he is great. I just think he is so wonderful. I'm 
going to try to talk to him, too, because he... He

04:11.840 --> 04:15.307
was supposed to be involved with Wardlaw before 
the press came in. Yes, he was. He knew him in

04:16.569 --> 04:19.795
Austin. Yeah, his father taught him. His favorite 
father taught him. And I'm sure he would have said,

04:23.662 --> 04:29.934
nah, he's not coming over to the college station. 
You know, it was like that. There was no way you'd

04:33.271 --> 04:35.934
get Ward Lovett. How about the region from the 
press now? Was that a pretty happy accord? Oh,

04:40.981 --> 04:41.502
sure. They were sensitive and understanding? 
They were. Several of them. I had Vandiver come to

04:45.988 --> 04:51.255
the last Board of Regents meeting and Tom Rotell. I 
put it on. I used it as an excuse for his new book

04:53.698 --> 04:57.743
that's coming out. And he brought books for all the 
regents. He signed them all and gave each one of

05:02.239 --> 05:05.283
them one. And several of the regents came up to me 
afterwards and said, what a nice thing to do. And

05:09.728 --> 05:13.152
thanked me for calling this to their attention. So 
it was, yes, they liked the

05:13.192 --> 05:18.778
press. So that was good. Well, wouldn't you like 
it? That's right. That's the good point. The kind

05:23.123 --> 05:26.987
of books we publish are certainly They're not 
controversial in any way at all. They're just all

05:30.242 --> 05:32.785
scholarly books. I mean, I know I've been over the 
back of the Committee of the Press now. That's a

05:38.693 --> 05:40.175
win-win situation. Well, yeah. I know Clint 
Phillips always said, you know, that's one of the

05:41.016 --> 05:47.183
happiest things I've ever done in Texas A&M is be on 
the Press Committee. It really is. Haskell Monroe

05:47.784 --> 05:49.186
said that, too. Haskell's moving back, I guess. I 
know it. Yes, I do know it. Catch him. I'm very

05:53.151 --> 05:55.734
excited about that sort of thing. Yeah, that's 
great. Yes, by all means, be sure and talk to him.

06:00.300 --> 06:14.277
He's somebody that's, bless his heart, you know, 
when they tore the old press building, the old

06:00.300 --> 06:14.277
border, he just built it down after the fire. He 
gets in there and, you know, gets bricks and pieces

06:15.238 --> 06:19.764
of the building or something. Well, he got one of 
these big old weights in the windows, you know, the

06:19.784 --> 06:24.209
array of the windows. That big... round iron thing 
that goes up and think, well, he got one of those for

06:27.245 --> 06:31.749
me. He brought it home to my house. Of course, I 
never would have thought of having one of those.

06:36.553 --> 06:37.174
Well, I have one. You still have it. I still have it. 
Sure, I do. And I think of Haskell every time I see

06:40.176 --> 06:45.521
that. I told him when we tore down the Warefield 
house that I'm going to get a brick from there. I

06:51.166 --> 06:52.947
wonder if he still hauls those bricks around. 
Sure, he does. I know he does, because he keeps

06:53.808 --> 06:56.070
them. Well, any

06:56.506 --> 07:14.228
last

06:56.506 --> 07:14.228
words?
