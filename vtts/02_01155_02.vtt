WEBVTT

00:01.752 --> 00:07.399
We'll just talk about it because it's... 
Somebody, who was it? The University Archives

00:08.280 --> 00:14.248
came

00:08.280 --> 00:14.248
to me about three or four years ago. And a bunch of 
what you've asked is... You've got it. Well, let me

00:17.231 --> 00:18.233
go get that tape. I didn't realize that. Okay, 
Charles Schulz or Dave Chapman? Well, I forgot

00:21.296 --> 00:25.682
now, but I've got a copy, and I'm going to copy it and 
give it to you. All right.

00:29.984 --> 00:42.521
One thing you mentioned there about practice, 
there is an

00:29.984 --> 00:42.521
effort, at least, to say that every veterinarian 
practices his profession. Now, there are those

00:43.662 --> 00:49.310
who say that, well, practice is private clinical 
practice. Okay, that's the way I'm reading it.

00:50.932 --> 00:51.553
There is private.

00:54.824 --> 00:58.368
I practice my profession in academia. Good. OK. 
That's a good point. Because I was defining

01:01.933 --> 01:07.159
practice as being in the business of veterinary 
medicine, the private enterprise. Most people

01:07.319 --> 01:08.200
do. And then they say, well, you're the guy who's 
not practicing. We feel like we're practicing our

01:11.444 --> 01:13.627
profession after all that. Well, that's a good 
point. That will help me relieve some of the

01:14.468 --> 01:19.414
tensions I see between the two areas. So we're all 
in the same pot there, all seeking to do the same

01:19.951 --> 01:33.527
thing, and that is, the end result is a service to 
the people that they can't do themselves. Okay.

01:34.608 --> 01:35.069
For a fee. All right. Now, we don't charge a fee, but 
we get people who can charge a fee, you see, when

01:36.671 --> 01:44.620
they're out in private clinical practice. We're 
not private clinical practitioners. Not even

01:47.944 --> 01:48.625
our... Veterinary hospital here is not private. 
It's a public. So it's not a private, but it's

01:53.028 --> 01:57.914
practice nevertheless. Well, anyway, let's go 
back to the

01:59.016 --> 02:04.002
front. Are you a Texan? Oh, yeah. Born and raised in 
Erath County, Texas. Yeah. I was born to a farm

02:12.332 --> 02:15.956
family. My daddy was a farmer. He was a Sandyland 
peanut farmer. He also later got into the beef

02:21.690 --> 02:29.360
cattle business and was a beef cattle producer. My 
grandfather, he got into it because of my

02:29.400 --> 02:32.805
grandfather. My mother's father, not his own. His 
own father died before I was ever born. But my

02:39.273 --> 02:46.523
mother's daddy was in the beef cattle business and 
bred and sold it. hold her for cattle. And he wasn't

02:49.532 --> 03:03.669
in the slaughter

02:49.532 --> 03:03.669
grade kind of production, but he sold bulls to all 
of the country. When did he get into that? Ooh.

03:09.636 --> 03:10.117
I don't know. Can't tell you. The year or anything 
like that. In the 20s or 30s? No, it's early. Is that

03:14.902 --> 03:15.463
right? The reason I ask, I have an uncle who was in 
Louisiana, but he was in the purebred Hereford

03:15.680 --> 03:23.552
business. And it was partly, even in the 40s or so, 
30s, I guess, when he got into it, it was a novel kind

03:23.592 --> 03:29.821
of thing. There wasn't much of a chemistry. Well, 
of course, my grandfather on the other side, we had

03:32.264 --> 03:43.341
big old Hereford's that came to Texas from 
supposedly Mississippi. And... he never would

03:45.042 --> 03:58.697
reveal where he came from specifically, and never 
would reveal any of his kinfolks, so we wonder if he

03:45.042 --> 03:58.697
had to skip country or something like that, you 
know? We had an expression in Louisiana, going to

03:58.798 --> 04:01.361
Texas. It meant something. Anyway, he couldn't 
read nor write. He couldn't even count. One, two,

04:12.273 --> 04:14.155
three, four, like, But he died. He had 33,000 acres 
of land and a whole bunch of cattle and did pretty

04:18.385 --> 04:25.633
well. But he came to Texas and Benton County and he 
went to work for an old fellow that lived there in

04:25.693 --> 04:33.601
Benton County on a little farm, just day labor. And 
he did it with a pretty good hand

04:34.622 --> 04:44.192
and his employer had been decided that, you know, 
rent to him on the haves. He'd furnish all the mules

04:48.297 --> 04:56.950
and the hornets and the plows and the seed and 
they'd split the profits at the end. And then he did

04:56.970 --> 05:00.775
that for a while and decided he wanted to go 
three-fourths. And so he got his own mules and

05:00.795 --> 05:05.182
farmed the land. And then the next step was he 
bought the land right out of scratch. And from

05:12.232 --> 05:13.133
there he got on up into the cattle business. Well, 
anyway, my daddy got into the beef cattle business

05:17.621 --> 05:24.912
because of my mother's father, really. But 
principally, he was a

05:24.932 --> 05:31.001
farmer. Well, having grown up there in Erath 
County, Sandy Man, there wasn't anything there

05:31.021 --> 05:41.196
for me when I graduated from high school. So I went 
to the oil field in Porter, Texas. You remember

05:48.508 --> 05:50.090
what year was that? That was 1935. And

05:52.052 --> 06:07.791
from there, well in there I worked in the Alamo 
refinery, what was then called Wittenberg.

06:09.053 --> 06:15.002
later the name later changed to Phillips, but it's 
a little subdivision outside of the border of

06:09.053 --> 06:15.002
Texas. I worked in an Alamo refinery, the gasoline 
refinery there. And I was in with some guys that

06:18.908 --> 06:21.232
were 30 years old. I was 17 years old right off the 
farm. Green is gold, you know. And those guys had

06:27.301 --> 06:30.666
been working in the oil field for a long time. They 
knew how to play off Ivan the Foreman, you know, all

06:30.686 --> 06:36.495
that stuff.

06:37.859 --> 06:42.586
They treated me like I was their son, I guess. Great 
guys. You know, they were giving me the shirt off

06:44.990 --> 06:47.173
their back. But they were vile, and they were 
vulgar, and their language was terrible. And they

06:52.360 --> 06:59.911
were always kidding with me, you know, and sending 
me over to get something that didn't even exist or

06:52.360 --> 06:59.911
something. Just pranks. Well, I liked those guys, 
but at the end of the year, I thought, well, there's

07:01.574 --> 07:06.381
got to be something better than this. So I quit, and 
I came back home to Erad County. And thinking about

07:15.200 --> 07:23.830
going to college, I thought about several 
universities and colleges. I decided I was

07:23.850 --> 07:29.296
Baptist, and my family was Baptist. I went over to 
Baylor, I guess. I went over to Baylor University.

07:32.779 --> 07:33.280
I got a job. I had to have a job where I couldn't go. So 
I got a job shooting sidewalks to begin with. Went

07:40.088 --> 07:43.952
back home and told Dad about it. And he said, well, 
Al, I just, you know, I'm concerned about it. I'm

07:49.118 --> 07:52.061
afraid you're going to get over there and get 
started. And then the money's going to run out. And

07:55.165 --> 07:56.827
you just can't finish. This was before

07:56.847 --> 08:03.414
I went to the oil field. I got to the oil field. This 
was before the oil field. He said he was just afraid

08:06.487 --> 08:10.472
that I couldn't make it. And that night, I thought, 
well, you know, Dad's pretty smart, and I am, and

08:11.032 --> 08:18.201
maybe he's right. So I went back to Waco and told him 
I wasn't coming. Went on back home, and then I went

08:26.411 --> 08:32.217
to the oil field, border Texas, and then had that 
experience there. Well, when I came back home that

08:32.298 --> 08:36.122
time, Dad was in no position to help me. It was right 
after we began to come out of the Great Depression.

08:44.498 --> 08:46.100
He just didn't have it. Scratching out of living 
there in that little sand hill in the farm. So he

08:52.669 --> 09:02.481
said, well, let's go over to De Leon and see if I can 
mortgage a heifer or something and get you a little

08:52.669 --> 09:02.481
money. So I had

09:03.608 --> 09:27.861
to

09:03.608 --> 09:27.861
have

09:03.608 --> 09:27.861
a job again.

09:28.082 --> 09:32.788
A guy came along that was I guess you'd call him the 
garbage collector. He was going around town

09:37.046 --> 09:38.989
picking up garbage. And out at the edge of town, he 
had a hog farm. And he'd take my garbage out to feed

09:42.654 --> 09:45.539
his hogs. So he gave me a job. And that's what I did, 
was go around and pick up that garbage and go out and

09:46.720 --> 09:53.831
feed the hogs. And that way, I was able to make 
enough to make it through Tarleton. Finished

10:01.222 --> 10:02.724
Tarleton in a couple of years. It was a junior 
college then. And then I wanted to come to Texas. So

10:08.960 --> 10:10.422
I talked to Dad again. I had paid all my debts there, 
but I didn't have enough money to come to Texas. Dad

10:15.930 --> 10:18.834
said, well, let's go back to the bank. And we went 
back to the bank. It was worth $50. And I stood at the

10:24.181 --> 10:32.593
edge of Stephenville, Texas and put a ride down on a 
flatbed truck with a guy that was going to Houston.

10:33.232 --> 10:36.576
I threw my luggage on the back end of that truck, and 
here we went. I sat back there, and the wind was

10:36.717 --> 10:41.483
blowing, and I was nearly blowing off of that. He 
stopped at the east gate over there, and I got off

10:41.603 --> 10:50.975
with my luggage, and I started walking up with 
little big old pillows there. And I said, an old

10:50.995 --> 10:55.562
country boy like me can't do this. I turned around, 
and I started back down to Texas Avenue. the

11:02.510 --> 11:03.551
kitchen right back home. I can't do that. Then I 
said to myself, you idiot. You're an idiot. Just a

11:09.239 --> 11:10.321
plain idiot. So I turned around and went on back up 
there. Well, fortunately, at Tarleton, there was

11:13.345 --> 11:23.018
a veterinarian that taught me dairy science at 
Tarleton. Of course, in dairy science, his name

11:23.038 --> 11:25.682
was Vern Scott. There is a Vern Scott Jr. today 
practicing there. This is Vern Scott Sr. He's

11:32.452 --> 11:34.134
deceased. He was our veterinarian out on the 
ranching industry that Dad had, small but little.

11:43.125 --> 11:45.708
And I'd watched him, you know, come out there. He'd 
come out there and do some work. He interested me

11:47.735 --> 11:54.245
very much, and I guess he is really the source of my 
interest in veterinary medicine. Because

11:54.265 --> 11:55.567
usually there is someone like that. I was going to 
ask you if you've been a county agent or a

11:55.587 --> 12:00.414
vocational ag teacher or what, but it was this guy. 
Yeah, Dr. Vern Scott. And he knew Dr. C.N.

12:06.824 --> 12:09.448
Shepardson, Mr. C.N. Shepardson it was, who used 
to be dean of agriculture here. Before that, he was

12:13.194 --> 12:15.798
head of the Department of Dairy Science. Yeah. And 
he and Vern Scott had a relationship. And Vern

12:21.107 --> 12:34.105
Scott told me that when you get down there, if you 
have any problems or anything like that, or you

12:21.107 --> 12:34.105
need some help or something, you go over to see Mr. 
Shepherds and just tell him what it is. And he's a

12:34.125 --> 12:36.808
guy that'll help you. Well, I wanted to study 
veterinary medicine. He was over in dairy

12:38.371 --> 12:39.752
science. So I went to the College of Veterinary 
Medicine.

12:46.898 --> 12:52.343
then dean of veterinary medicine.

12:54.205 --> 12:56.367
What was his name? Oh, Dr. Maff, no one. Second 
dean. Marsteller. Marsteller. Marsteller,

13:01.651 --> 13:04.134
yeah, Marsteller, of course. I don't know why. 
Yeah, me too. I went blank. Marsteller was dean

13:07.316 --> 13:13.622
there, and I went over to Dr. Marsteller and told 
him I want to study veterinary medicine. He said,

13:13.642 --> 13:14.543
well, fine. And I said, well, I've got to have a job. 
He said, well, that may be a problem. He said, it's

13:19.391 --> 13:28.220
getting a little late in the summer, and all the 
jobs we're going to have for students have already

13:19.391 --> 13:28.220
been committed this fall. And I just can't give you 
any more. Oh, I may have to go back home. But I

13:36.928 --> 13:41.753
remembered what Dr. Vern Scott told me. Go over and 
see Mr. Shepherds. So I ambled over to Mr.

13:45.151 --> 13:52.199
Shepardson's office over in the agricultural 
building, still standing there. And his office

13:52.219 --> 13:54.141
was in there. And told him who I was. But Colonel 
Scott told me to come see him. He agreed with me and

14:01.930 --> 14:08.597
said, well, yeah, I think we can get you a job down on 
the dairy farm. We'll find one. Now, you'd have to

14:10.640 --> 14:14.584
be a dairy science major, however, You can't work 
over there. Well, I want to study veterinary

14:17.230 --> 14:21.136
medicine, but I couldn't do that. And I couldn't 
without a job. Well, maybe I better go the other

14:22.739 --> 14:24.201
way. At least I'll be in college. So I went over. I 
told him, I'll take it. And so he did. And I cleaned

14:30.190 --> 14:40.506
the barn, milked cows, and mowed grass for 25 cents 
an hour over there in dairy science. And I

14:40.526 --> 14:43.170
graduated in dairy science in 1940. a BS degree. I 
had every intention of going into, going to work

14:46.552 --> 14:52.061
somewhere. I wasn't sure what with a BS degree and 
trying to save enough money to come back to

14:53.102 --> 15:03.679
veterinary

14:53.102 --> 15:03.679
medicine. So... Excuse me, what kind of job 
opportunities were there then for BS in animal

15:04.280 --> 15:09.228
science? Pretty good in the 40s, 90s, and 40s? 
Yeah, I think so. I got a job before the summer was

15:13.880 --> 15:17.284
out. Graduated in May of 40, and before the summer 
was out, I had a job. There was a guy in dairy

15:23.212 --> 15:38.611
science, however,

15:23.212 --> 15:38.611
who coached the judging

15:23.212 --> 15:38.611
teams.

15:38.631 --> 15:40.073
That's all right. He's deceased. But anyway, he 
got me a job in Lockhart, Texas on the Rock and Berry

15:44.980 --> 16:00.820
farm down there. A guy with the name of Wilson 
managed it. We had 600 cows milking. And most of the

16:05.146 --> 16:07.829
milk went to Austin. Anyway, I went down there and 
started working the fall of Well late summer of

16:11.896 --> 16:29.763
1940 and then of course

16:11.896 --> 16:29.763
stayed there until World War II broke out and I'd 
been through the Corps of Cadets and the Reserve

16:11.896 --> 16:29.763
Officer and then World War II broke out and of 
course I got called in and I quit. And didn't get

16:29.783 --> 16:38.596
back in that three year span that I had intended but 
in the meantime the war went on. Spent four little

16:38.716 --> 16:40.519
four years there. And in the meantime, had 
married. And by the time I got back to the States,

16:43.388 --> 16:53.904
I'd saved enough money to come to the College of 
Veterinary Medicine. So in 1946, then, I came back

16:53.924 --> 17:02.677
to study veterinary medicine and graduated in 
1949. Well, you were also in the GI Bill. Yeah,

17:04.480 --> 17:05.882
yeah, that's right. Did you run into a guy named Ray 
Hargis while you were a student? Yeah, sure. Ray's

17:10.083 --> 17:10.743
my cousin. Is that right? Yeah, he'd been shot down 
in Germany in 41 or 42, spent three years in prison

17:11.765 --> 17:17.952
and came back over here. Yeah, you bet. That's 
interesting. You bet. So you came back in 46 and

17:23.839 --> 17:26.943
then finished your degree in 49. Came back in 
February of 46. Was the demand for it, was it tough

17:32.660 --> 17:36.865
to get into the school at that time? Do you 
remember? In terms of numbers? Well, the numbers

17:42.613 --> 17:49.041
weren't as fast as they are today. They had some 
more variation. But my class started

17:52.946 --> 18:00.996
with, well, I'm almost afraid to tell you the exact 
numbers now. That's all right. I was wondering

18:02.864 --> 18:06.308
because it's so competitive now to get in there. We 
lost a bunch. More

18:09.352 --> 18:21.367
than half that

18:09.352 --> 18:21.367
classroom failed out. That started when I 
started. We graduated on 44 students. I think it

18:24.692 --> 18:25.232
was 72 students. That sounds about right. I seem 
like I've seen that number, that camera number as

18:26.354 --> 18:29.818
well. At that time, what did most of the students, 
the veterinary students, anticipate going into

18:31.030 --> 18:37.697
upon graduation? Private clinical practice. 
Into private clinical practice. In the country,

18:40.780 --> 18:44.705
rural settings, cattle business, large animals. 
Large animals. Okay. I'm going to follow that a

18:45.646 --> 18:47.788
little bit with you later. Yeah, that was what I had 
my practice place picked out before I graduated.

18:55.396 --> 18:56.177
You were as good. I didn't go in there, but I...

19:04.548 --> 19:10.113
So I guess it was Vern Scott that really kicked it 
off for me. And then...

19:10.994 --> 19:23.364
Well, I think that was

19:10.994 --> 19:23.364
the main... So when you got your degree, what 
happened to you then? You didn't go in private? No,

19:26.937 --> 19:49.994
I was

19:26.937 --> 19:49.994
going

19:26.937 --> 19:49.994
to clean it. It goes down the other side of Wake. It 
goes to Hackensack, doesn't it? It does. It's over

19:51.636 --> 19:51.957
there. Yeah. It goes to Crankville. Yeah. Anyway, 
there's a little town, I don't know, 37,000 or

19:52.992 --> 20:00.701
something like that. And it was a pretty good dairy 
shed. Well, I had a dairy science, yes, degree in

20:02.803 --> 20:07.869
DVM. And what I planned to do was become a dairy 
practitioner, dairy cattle, and concentrate on

20:07.889 --> 20:18.101
dairy cattle. Going to little places like that, 
you couldn't, you had to be somewhat of a

20:18.121 --> 20:22.746
generalist. Because there's nobody else there to 
concentrate on. Well, long in the fourth year

20:30.280 --> 20:51.450
before we graduated, when I came back here and 
started veterinary medicine,

20:51.785 --> 21:03.539
I got a job as an instructor in the Department of 
Veterinary Physiology, and I was teaching

20:51.785 --> 21:03.539
in Veterinary Physiology. So I'd had Army 
experience and had taught in the Army, trained

21:05.501 --> 21:20.779
soldiers, and then the experience there in the 
Department of Veterinary Physiology.

21:21.316 --> 21:25.880
Then I was about to graduate with a degree. And Dr. 
John Milliff, who was head of the Department of

21:25.900 --> 21:44.818
Anatomy,

21:25.900 --> 21:44.818
in the laboratory one day, histology laboratory, 
he came to my side and said, Pryor said, have you

21:25.900 --> 21:44.818
ever thought about teaching? I said, no. He said, 
what are you going to do? I'm going to Clifton. I'm

21:50.155 --> 22:00.588
going to Clifton, Texas.

22:00.808 --> 22:08.618
I'm

22:00.808 --> 22:08.618
going to Clifton, Texas and practice . He said, 
well, why don't

22:08.638 --> 22:14.486
you think about it? And I saw what he said. I don't 
know what months or so went by, and he asked me again

22:15.707 --> 22:17.850
about the possibility of going into teaching. I 
said, no, I don't know. I don't know if he intended

22:18.391 --> 22:19.572
the whole thing. And

22:20.142 --> 22:27.069
he didn't argue with me or anything. But he came 
back the third time. And I thought, well, maybe

22:30.253 --> 22:33.176
wrong. Maybe he was telling me something. And 
finally he said on that third time, he said, I've

22:34.097 --> 22:44.628
got a job for

22:34.097 --> 22:44.628
you if you take it. And I said, well, let me think 
about it and talk to my wife about it. I'll be back to

22:46.990 --> 22:47.390
you. Then I thought about it and thought, well, you 
know, I'm going to do it for you. And then I can still

22:50.467 --> 22:57.457
go to Texas for the market. So I came back and told 
him, OK. And he said, well, that's fine. Then you

23:04.949 --> 23:07.352
got the job. I said, OK. So I graduated, and the sun 
was out, and fall came, and I went in to sing. a

23:16.538 --> 23:24.370
couple of Sissons and that, and they had a book that 
says, we're going to teach

23:16.538 --> 23:24.370
this. Sessons? What was the book? Sessons? Yeah. 
Yeah, I remember that title. That's why I was

23:31.500 --> 23:35.046
asking. I've got the old original. It's Sissons. 
Sissons? Yeah. S-I-S-S-O-N. It's Sissons.

23:44.787 --> 23:46.049
Grossman. I remember some of those old

23:46.069 --> 23:54.181
titles. Excuse me.

24:06.120 --> 24:12.229
That's something else I'd kind of like to ask you 
about, is the textbook and teaching. side of it

24:12.749 --> 24:14.011
sometimes. Well, he handed me that book and of 
course I had been through the book and had me in

24:14.111 --> 24:20.222
school. That's the textbook we used. And he handed 
me the book and said, that's what you're going to

24:23.187 --> 24:27.695
teach. And that's all the instructions I had.

24:32.884 --> 24:37.272
So I started teaching and never left.

24:40.660 --> 24:42.362
And obviously you enjoyed it. What was your 
starting salary? $3,200 a year. I always wanted my

24:49.132 --> 24:52.737
starting salary, too. I still got it here. I have 
every payday in my drawer right there. A little

25:02.031 --> 25:02.692
card. Now, what would have been the situation had 
you gone into practice in Clifton? Well, of

25:07.508 --> 25:12.513
course, Clifton no longer is a dairy store. So 
something else would have had to happen. And what

25:15.475 --> 25:18.258
would have happened, I have no idea. What kind of 
income or living would you have made had you gone

25:18.378 --> 25:24.123
into practice in Clifton at that time? I'd had to 
starve for about three years. Yeah, that was a

25:26.825 --> 25:30.228
pretty standard procedure when it'd be tough to 
get into the business. Absolutely. Now, when a

25:31.550 --> 25:37.515
practitioner like that went out into business on 
their own, basically you hang a shingle up and

25:31.550 --> 25:37.515
you're on your own. Is it a matter of good public 
relations, a matter of someone being available?

25:44.700 --> 25:46.442
What makes it work or not work? Mostly public 
relations. You've got to do a good job. Yeah, sure.

25:51.328 --> 25:52.089
Technical work. That's true, but good public 
relations. People have to want to come to you.

25:57.836 --> 25:59.358
They've got to like you. I don't care if you're good 
at your technology. People will like you and

26:03.223 --> 26:06.407
they're not going to come to you. And that's what 
some veterinarians miss. You've got to satisfy

26:10.550 --> 26:13.012
them. And sometimes you've got to do some things 
that you don't think was best, but they thought was

26:13.032 --> 26:18.396
best. Now, when a veterinarian went out into 
practice then and now, I guess this is a broad thing

26:20.458 --> 26:33.189
I've been kind of interested in, was there or is 
there any business training for that

26:20.458 --> 26:33.189
veterinarian? Very little. And still today, much 
too little. The main thing that I've heard through

26:38.110 --> 26:54.345
the years, being here at the College of Veterinary 
Medicine, of the people who left here, gone here,

26:38.110 --> 26:54.345
and then feeding information back as to what they 
needed most during that first five years of the

26:38.110 --> 26:54.345
practice was some business.

26:59.409 --> 27:08.117
I'm wondering about that because, you know, just 
in that TVMA meeting the other day, it came

26:59.409 --> 27:08.117
immediately clear to me, these people are 
basically businessmen. it seemed to me. I mean, I

27:10.280 --> 27:11.861
know they're technicians, too. They're doctors, 
but they're running businesses, and those

27:11.941 --> 27:18.428
businesses, some of them apparently were big 
operations. I know I was talking to Pinky in El

27:18.508 --> 27:23.473
Paso. Sorry, but anyway.

27:27.597 --> 27:34.504
And I gathered he's got a lot of operating as a 
businessman, as much as anything else. And a lot of

27:34.604 --> 27:36.025
these people have. You're running a business. 
That's correct. So that was just one aspect that I

27:38.270 --> 27:41.313
was sort of intrigued about. Well, in the period of 
time to get the technology in, there is just not

27:41.734 --> 27:51.785
time to make a businessman. Of course, medical 
doctors have the same situation. Yeah, that's

27:53.907 --> 27:54.648
correct. Now, they will learn it the hard way. If 
you give them the business without the

27:59.654 --> 28:05.340
technology, they can't learn that the hard way. So 
you've got to give them the technology, the arts

28:05.860 --> 28:12.828
and skills, the practice of what you mentioned. 
And then they will learn on their own. The

28:16.693 --> 28:23.601
business, it'll finally, for most of them, 
they'll melt. Now there are some that can and they

28:24.301 --> 28:28.346
fade from the scene. When they go out of here, now or 
in 1949, Did you have any idea what kind of charges

28:32.033 --> 28:36.698
you should make for services and anything like 
that? Yeah, we talked about that a little bit in

28:37.819 --> 28:41.684
school. And we also had the practitioners, 
private clinical practitioners who would come

28:41.984 --> 28:49.172
and talk with us. It was in a seminar where we talked 
to the class about their experiences. And that was

28:55.579 --> 28:59.663
good education. They donated their time. And we'd 
ask them questions, you know. What do you charge

29:05.196 --> 29:08.381
for so-and-so? You could get a pretty good idea. On 
the other hand, even then, and I guess even more

29:11.866 --> 29:24.186
after that, graduates were encouraged not to go 
directly into your private clinical practice. Go

29:24.206 --> 29:26.370
to work, for a better matter. Observe what it is out 
there in real world. This veterinary hospital

29:30.218 --> 29:40.651
here is great, but it doesn't teach you the 
business end of that, nor the public relations end

29:30.218 --> 29:40.651
of that, the personal end of that. And you'll learn 
that by just observing out there and working with a

29:40.671 --> 29:44.896
veterinarian. Number one is, if you go out there 
and you make a blunder in your practice, people are

29:45.477 --> 29:55.710
not going to come back to you. You go out there and 
make a blunder in his practice, and he's already

29:55.730 --> 29:58.774
rooted. And they'll come back to him. So you learn 
from him and do your mistakes at his expense rather

30:01.210 --> 30:07.137
than your own. Will you say that apprenticeship is 
more common now than it was, say, in the earlier

30:08.558 --> 30:16.106
period? And do most of your students now going out 
of here actually go into some sort of

30:16.126 --> 30:21.072
apprenticeship situation? I guess, if nothing 
else, having the capital to go into business would

30:22.313 --> 30:28.660
be a pretty big outlay. Well, of course it was. So, I 
know a lot of our, our years have known a lot of vet

30:30.915 --> 30:34.821
students. Many of them

30:36.464 --> 30:44.858
get into veterinary medicine because they like 
animals. Yeah, one of the things you're telling me

30:44.878 --> 30:49.045
is that maybe the most important thing is that they 
like people. Well, if they don't like people,

30:49.919 --> 30:53.943
they'd better not do it. But it was people. Yeah, 
sure. Do you screen, or in the interview process

30:54.844 --> 31:03.412
that you go through, do you try, I mean, for their 
own good, I would assume? Has that always

31:03.432 --> 31:04.393
happened? Did that happen in 1949? Well, I don't 
know if 1949. I wasn't on the admission end of 1949.

31:13.722 --> 31:15.844
And just how they did it then, I don't know. But 
we've tried through the years to build that. It's

31:19.923 --> 31:25.230
hard to do, and it's subjective as it can be. But 
yeah, they make an effort to... That's a good

31:25.250 --> 31:28.935
question. How would you describe or profile a 
typical veterinarian or a student or someone that

31:28.975 --> 31:39.448
you think should be in that kind of business? Do you 
have an image of a veterinarian?

31:44.595 --> 31:47.018
I have an image of what a veterinarian ought to be. 
What is that? Yes. And my image may be false.

31:57.362 --> 32:03.548
Number one, he's got to be accurate. Accuracy of 
the technology, the skill, the art. And you know

32:11.134 --> 32:15.718
we've lost a great part of the art.

32:16.419 --> 32:17.019
What do you mean by that? Parenthetically, here 
then. Dr. A. A. Leonard, who used to be the head of

32:22.566 --> 32:33.782
the clinics,

32:22.566 --> 32:33.782
was an artist.

32:33.802 --> 32:40.491
He could go out there and look at an animal and say, 
he didn't have to test. I don't mean he didn't have

32:40.511 --> 32:46.039
to test, but often he didn't have to run tests. He 
had the visual capability of perceiving what that

32:50.238 --> 32:51.740
was. And that's an art. That's not a skill. That's 
an art. You work on that. Today we have tests,

32:59.691 --> 33:05.519
tests, tests, tests, tests, you see. And there's 
nothing wrong with tests. But we are losing the art

33:07.702 --> 33:13.950
of the practice of that. I don't want to put words in 
your mouth. Getting into more skills. So it's more

33:16.876 --> 33:19.720
technology-oriented than... Absolutely. Well, 
we didn't have the technology. So we had to do the

33:23.645 --> 33:26.009
art. And, you know, when I say art and skills, I 
guess art is a skill, too. No, I know what you mean.

33:37.825 --> 33:43.313
The intuition to say, that's that. Well, I know 
that, for instance, way back there in the 1930s,

33:44.052 --> 34:12.083
Byrne Scott came to our place, and Dad had called

33:44.052 --> 34:12.083
him, and he came, and Dad had a cow in the corral, and 
she wasn't doing anything good either. Dad

34:12.103 --> 34:12.844
obviously knew she was ill. Dr. Berne Scott looked 
over the fence and said, yeah. He says, she has

34:15.891 --> 34:19.475
hardware disease. I said, what's hardware 
disease? He says, it's traumatic pericarditis. I

34:29.768 --> 34:31.210
said, what? He said, no. Cleared that right out.

34:36.837 --> 34:38.960
Well, I sure know she did. There were certain signs 
and symptoms that that animal displayed that he

34:40.642 --> 34:52.897
had seen so many times that he knew what that was. He 
didn't have to go any further. Now, that is skill,

34:54.960 --> 34:57.583
but it's also art. And we have lost a lot of that. You 
know, the old cow, he's tipped. She's got metal in

35:06.318 --> 35:10.743
her, pericardium in her heart. She swallows a nail 
or a wire or something. It goes into the stomach,

35:14.927 --> 35:16.569
into the rumen. The rumen sits just behind the 
diaphragm, and the heart's over on this side

35:17.069 --> 35:21.874
beating. And you try to put a hammer on the handle by 
hitting one end. So literally, that's what's

35:27.520 --> 35:29.382
happening. And the little heart's sitting there 
beating. It just draws that thing right through

35:32.225 --> 35:34.047
the... diaphragm and into the pericardium, the 
covering of the heart. And all kinds of organisms

35:38.578 --> 35:45.968
in the room go in there, and she has an 
inflammation, an infection of the pericardium.

35:46.268 --> 35:47.089
Traumatic. It was traumatic pericarditis.

35:57.382 --> 36:03.029
So a veterinarian is someone who is technically 
skilled in the factory. Yeah. At this day and time,

36:04.469 --> 36:08.974
he has to have the technology to compete. You can't 
do it without the techniques and the implements

36:08.994 --> 36:17.044
and the gadgetry that you've developed. But to 
tell you the thing, one of the biggest things today

36:17.064 --> 36:30.780
is non-invasive techniques, sonar and all this, 
so that you can see what's inside without invading

36:31.503 --> 36:33.427
the body of an invasive. And that's a great 
problem. Because any time you invade the body, the

36:36.694 --> 36:47.617
flesh, you cause a potential problem of infection 
and this sort of thing. You can see what's in there

36:47.637 --> 36:50.142
without doing that. You're way ahead of the game. 
So we're getting better and better and better with

36:53.440 --> 37:01.512
the technology, and it's going to get better and 
better, and the skills are going to be less and

36:53.440 --> 37:01.512
less. And when I say skills and arts, they're going 
to continue to subside. And I'm not saying that's

37:06.740 --> 37:10.626
wrong at all. So you've got to have the technology 
this day and time. Used to it had to be the arts and

37:13.290 --> 37:17.236
the skills, and now the technology. Now the second 
thing the guy's got to have is public relations.

37:24.811 --> 37:25.892
He's got to like people. He's got to know people and 
relate to people. We have so many

37:32.061 --> 37:41.553
little girls coming. Girls, women, young women 
come to get their medicine because they fell in

37:41.573 --> 37:51.046
love with a horse. Well, I'm not going to get on with 
that. But you've got to have more than that. Some of

37:54.747 --> 37:58.350
them will say, well, I just love animals. Shoot, 
you wouldn't want a veterinarian if you didn't

37:58.370 --> 38:01.573
love animals. But that's just the beginning of it. 
So that is an innate part of veterinary medicine is

38:04.796 --> 38:08.860
an affection, let's say, for animals. Oh, yeah. 
You have to have compassion for the welfare of the

38:09.700 --> 38:13.544
animal. But on the other hand, we can't overlook 
the needs of the client. You're working for a

38:20.890 --> 38:22.932
client, not for an animal.

38:25.848 --> 38:27.971
And you've got to face those two also. There are 
times when you can't do what you want to do. Well,

38:34.419 --> 38:36.682
for one reason, it's too expensive. And you know 
that you could make that animal better, maybe

38:37.944 --> 38:48.297
heal, if you could do what you really wanted to do. 
But you can't afford to do it because it would cost

38:49.519 --> 38:55.146
more than that animal is worth. you know, we don't 
have that problem. You do it. And insurance covers

38:59.973 --> 39:02.216
it or something. On that same line, I know this is 
the right place to do it because we need to get back

39:02.236 --> 39:17.357
to the profile of a veterinarian, but as I see it 
too, one of the difficulties in promoting or

39:02.236 --> 39:17.357
advancing the practice of veterinary medicine 
has been the problem of cost. So, for example, In

39:19.932 --> 39:25.480
fact, I was raised with the idea that animals are 
basically expendable, that you don't spend money

39:19.932 --> 39:25.480
on them. I never spent a nickel on a pet. They were 
always free, and if they died, tough. You don't do

39:29.826 --> 39:30.847
that. I spend on them. That's an old agrarian 
philosophy, though. That's right, but I spend a

39:33.751 --> 39:36.756
lot of money on my dogs now. Yeah, well, we've got to 
round to the humans. animal barn today, you know.

39:41.940 --> 39:45.804
Yeah, and your high-priced equipment you're 
talking about is expensive stuff. Absolutely. So

39:46.405 --> 39:55.014
has part of the problem of veterinary medicine 
been convincing people that they need to invest in

39:46.405 --> 39:55.014
their animals? I'm not sure if I'm asking that 
question correctly, but that somehow or other, in

39:55.355 --> 40:05.626
other words, you can prove the efficiencies, the 
cost efficiencies of taking care of animals. Is

40:05.726 --> 40:06.747
that part of the of the message that veterinarians 
have had to get across in the Southwest? Well, you

40:11.475 --> 40:16.460
know, you can sort of classify people in two 
categories in that regard. Those who have

40:16.540 --> 40:22.085
compassion for and will go all out for their 
animal. And those who say, well, it's just a dog.

40:26.129 --> 40:27.270
Yeah. And there's a vast difference in that. This 
one over here will pay the price. There's no way.

40:35.578 --> 40:35.738
Yeah. Now, you know, they meld together in here, 
and they're not two extremes, but nevertheless,

40:36.190 --> 40:56.192
you have to know, as a veterinarian, as a private 
clinical practitioner, they have to know that

40:36.190 --> 40:56.192
this individual wants this dog fixed, no matter 
the cost. This one over here, no, he just wants to

40:56.973 --> 41:02.639
know, should have killed him. You know? And you've 
got all that in there. And you've got to weasel that

41:04.902 --> 41:09.688
out of the people of your clients. Your dog can't 
tell you that. And you don't know that, so you've

41:11.972 --> 41:15.436
got to get it from within. And that's where the 
human relationship has to come in, to know what

41:15.456 --> 41:20.904
that client wants done. That's really an 
intriguing and key point. And if you please that

41:25.069 --> 41:29.495
client, you've got a regular client. If you 
displease that client, And going somewhere else.

41:33.670 --> 41:38.377
And that's the way you build your business, is 
people relationship, not animals. Has that

41:38.737 --> 41:39.979
changed over the years? I mean, when you were 
growing up in Erath County, imagine all your

41:39.999 --> 41:47.370
neighbors were farmers, agriculturists. 
Animals were a means of production. They were

41:51.275 --> 41:51.856
pets. There wasn't necessarily a bond with the 
milk cows or with whatever, you know. Oh, Boston

41:58.372 --> 42:00.795
gets pretty close to the family. All right, but 
you're... You know, but as people move to the city,

42:00.935 --> 42:09.687
as they have pets for whatever reasons, there's a 
completely different attitude. My wife's from a

42:09.727 --> 42:10.508
farm. I'm not. And, you know, we run into that all 
the time. Because she's got one set of values about

42:16.856 --> 42:21.862
animals, and I've got a completely different set 
of values. And it's difficult for me to get around

42:21.882 --> 42:23.124
that. Yeah, you know... There are great extremes 
in this animal side. There's the animal rights

42:29.976 --> 42:33.681
activist, militant. I mean, crazy on that side. 
And then there are those who are just like

42:40.531 --> 42:50.504
barbarians to

42:40.531 --> 42:50.504
animals. In here, there's a better mix, I think. We 
need to be as humane as we can be with animals. I

43:00.607 --> 43:02.670
don't think animals have any rights. You talk 
about animal rights. They don't have any rights.

43:07.996 --> 43:21.012
But we as people ought to be,

43:07.996 --> 43:21.012
well, compassionate enough to treat that animal 
without being a barbarian. We need to treat that

43:22.073 --> 43:23.475
animal carefully and correctly. We don't want to 
cause that animal any pain, and we need to be as

43:29.021 --> 43:38.793
humanitarian as we can possibly be as 
veterinarians. Well, everybody should be free,

43:38.814 --> 43:42.719
not just veterinarians. And if you do that,

43:52.666 --> 43:55.769
You satisfy the activists. And some of the others 
over on this other side say, well, that's stupid.

43:59.633 --> 44:03.237
You're just wasting your money. But let me come 
back to it for you. Veterinarians ought to be

44:06.380 --> 44:21.255
standing for humanitarian

44:06.380 --> 44:21.255
care for the animals under their control or their 
owners. being the owners of what? So we need to do

44:25.776 --> 44:39.773
everything that we can to give that animal a 
comfortable bath time.

44:39.793 --> 44:41.976
Now, money comes into the picture. No question 
about that. And as I said, sometimes you can't do

44:43.658 --> 44:48.083
that because the owner won't let you do that. Won't 
pay the bill. Well, if you don't If you go doing that

44:52.218 --> 44:58.066
for people who don't pay the bill, your business is 
going to fall apart. And you've got to work those

44:58.086 --> 45:01.811
together. But humanitarianism is a very 
essential part of the life of a veterinarian. Yes.

45:08.100 --> 45:12.466
If you dislike animals, you ought not be there. And 
that's one of the things that they, in the

45:12.486 --> 45:20.217
admissions committee, will query the person 
about humanitarianism, you know. How do they feel

45:20.618 --> 45:25.444
about these things? On the other hand, the other 
extreme, that the animal has every right, and you

45:25.464 --> 45:42.366
can't use an animal in any form or shape for 
research, you're violating their rights? Well,

45:43.307 --> 45:46.351
that isn't so. My perception is that animals are 
here for a man. and people use the animals, not the

45:52.107 --> 45:59.275
animals using people. But the people should use 
the animal correctly, humanitarily, and then go

45:59.295 --> 46:09.748
on from there.

46:09.768 --> 46:19.279
So I think, yes, the veterinarian has to have a 
compassion and a love for animals. taught in the

46:19.698 --> 46:22.623
school, an ethical posture? Oh, yeah. We have no 
course in ethics, but we try to put ethics threaded

46:24.146 --> 46:31.299
through all of it.

46:34.745 --> 46:39.193
And we have differences of opinion among our 
students. We have students that don't want to

46:39.513 --> 46:43.360
dissect a dog, and the dog's been destroy him. He's 
been anesthetized and then euthanized.

46:53.147 --> 46:55.330
Painless. And if you're going to learn what he's 
made of, you've got to look at what he's made of. And

47:03.944 --> 47:06.208
they said, well, do it with slime.
