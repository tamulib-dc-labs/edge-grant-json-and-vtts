WEBVTT

00:01.360 --> 00:17.930
anytime we just talk about it because it's you've

00:01.360 --> 00:17.930
got

00:01.360 --> 00:17.930
well let me go get that tape I didn't realize that 
okay Charles Schultz or Dave Chapman one thing you

00:30.520 --> 00:40.400
mentioned there about practice there is a effort

00:30.520 --> 00:40.400
at least to say that every veterinarian

00:40.380 --> 01:04.030
practice because

00:40.380 --> 01:04.030
I was defining practice as being in the business 
that's

01:04.010 --> 01:17.770
a good point that will help me relieve some of the 
tensions I see between the two areas so we're all

01:17.750 --> 01:23.830
the same pot there and all seeking to do the same 
thing and that is the end result is a service to the

01:23.810 --> 01:32.490
that they can't do them so we get you are you a Texan

01:39.230 --> 03:15.270
when

01:39.230 --> 03:15.270
did he get

01:39.230 --> 03:15.270
into that

01:39.230 --> 03:15.270
in

01:39.230 --> 03:15.270
the 20s or 30s is that

01:39.230 --> 03:15.270
right

03:15.250 --> 03:24.140
reason I asked I have an uncle in Louisiana but he 
was in the purebred it was partly even in the 40s or

03:24.120 --> 03:28.600
so 30s I guess when he got into it it was a novel kind 
of

03:28.580 --> 03:59.540
thing

03:28.580 --> 03:59.540
he never would wonder if he had that you know we had 
an expression in Louisiana gone to Texas it meant

03:59.520 --> 04:25.270
something

03:59.520 --> 04:25.270
anyway

03:59.520 --> 04:25.270
did pretty well

04:25.250 --> 04:58.820
but he came to Texas and Benton

04:25.250 --> 04:58.820
County and he went to

04:25.250 --> 04:58.820
work decided he wanted

04:25.250 --> 04:58.820
to go through

04:25.250 --> 04:58.820
it

04:58.800 --> 05:34.140
and the

04:58.800 --> 05:34.140
next step was he bought

04:58.800 --> 05:34.140
the land

04:58.800 --> 05:34.140
having

04:58.800 --> 05:34.140
grown up there in e rod county Sandy Land

05:34.120 --> 06:00.930
you remember

05:34.120 --> 06:00.930
what what

05:34.120 --> 06:00.930
year was that 1935

05:34.120 --> 06:00.930
from there in there I worked in the Alamo I was in 
with

06:00.910 --> 06:23.070
some guys that were 30

06:00.910 --> 06:23.070
years old, and I was 17 years old, right off the farm 
green.

06:27.362 --> 06:33.860
Those guys had been working, and they knew how to 
play off and hide from the phone, you know, all that

06:33.840 --> 06:37.970
stuff. They treated me like I was their son, I 
guess, you know, they were giving me the shirt off

06:46.570 --> 06:53.010
their back, but they were vile, and they were 
vulgar, and their language was terrible. Always

06:52.990 --> 06:57.630
kidding with me, you know, and sending me over to 
get something, which didn't, didn't help.

07:01.593 --> 07:34.620
Well, there's got to

07:01.593 --> 07:34.620
be something

07:01.593 --> 07:34.620
better.

07:34.600 --> 08:11.110
I had to have a job where I couldn't

07:34.600 --> 08:11.110
go, so I got a job swooping

07:34.600 --> 08:11.110
sidewalks

07:34.600 --> 08:11.110
at the

07:34.600 --> 08:11.110
gate. And that night, I thought,

08:11.090 --> 08:32.010
well, you know, back home, and then I went to the oil 
fence there. Well, when I came home, back home that

08:32.270 --> 09:06.690
time, then, it was in the farm, you borrowed $25,

09:06.670 --> 09:21.670
that $25, and I went to the park, and then we had the 
new $25 is

09:06.670 --> 09:21.670
what I had to pay for it. I had to have it pay down, and 
I could pay the rest of it for a period of time. So, I

09:27.690 --> 09:29.710
had to have a job again. A guy came along that was,

09:29.690 --> 09:38.660
I guess you'd call it the garbage, picking up 
garbage, and out of it. So, he gave me a job, and

09:40.223 --> 09:55.410
that's what I did, was go around and pick up that 
garbage.

09:55.390 --> 10:01.340
That way, I was able to make enough to make it 
through Tarleton. Finished Tarleton in a couple

10:01.320 --> 10:04.340
of years. It was a junior college then, and then I 
went and paid all my debts there, but I didn't have

10:12.800 --> 10:25.550
enough

10:12.800 --> 10:25.550
money.

10:27.530 --> 10:27.955
the wind. He dropped it, stopped at the East Gate 
over there, and I got off with my luggage, and I

10:29.880 --> 10:36.870
started walking up a little big old pillar. An old 
country boy like me can't do this. get your ride

10:38.850 --> 10:39.871
back home. I can't do that.

10:43.850 --> 10:46.210
I said, you eat a little, and I'll give you a ride 
back home. Then,

10:48.190 --> 10:54.380
I said to myself, you idiot. You're just an idiot. 
Just a plain idiot. So, I turned around and went on

10:56.520 --> 10:57.541
back up there. Well, fortunately, at Tarleton, 
there was a- I guess he is really the source. The

11:06.540 --> 11:14.640
source of the- Because usually, it was a big 
success that you stayed up all night. For now,

11:16.500 --> 11:50.660
you

11:16.500 --> 11:50.660
should

11:16.500 --> 11:50.660
be able

11:16.500 --> 11:50.660
to

11:16.500 --> 11:50.660
eat

11:16.500 --> 11:50.660
with everyone

11:16.500 --> 11:50.660
else. Everyone else, everybody gets their food. 
You just get your food, and you're good.

11:54.470 --> 11:54.793
Definitely. is someone like that i was going to ask 
you if you've been a county agent or a vocational ag

11:58.730 --> 12:39.650
teacher or what

11:58.730 --> 12:39.650
but it

11:58.730 --> 12:39.650
was this guy yeah

11:58.730 --> 12:39.650
he knew

11:58.730 --> 12:39.650
dr

11:58.730 --> 12:39.650
cn shepards he and verne

11:58.730 --> 12:39.650
scott had very science so the

12:39.630 --> 13:06.380
second second dean uh marcelo marcelo marcelo 
yeah marcelo yeah me too i went blank marcelo it's

13:07.160 --> 14:18.060
getting a little late

13:07.160 --> 14:18.060
in the summer and i oh dairy

13:07.160 --> 14:18.060
science

13:07.160 --> 14:18.060
major i want to

13:07.160 --> 14:18.060
study

14:18.040 --> 14:25.440
veterinary medicine but without a job well maybe i 
better go the other way at least i'll be in college

14:25.420 --> 14:55.620
so i went over i told him i'll take it and so he did and

14:25.420 --> 14:55.620
had every intention of this degree

14:56.320 --> 15:06.260
and trying to save enough money to come back to it

14:56.320 --> 15:06.260
so see what what kind of job opportunities whether 
they're then for bs and animal science pretty good

15:06.240 --> 15:12.180
in the 40s yeah i think so uh i've got a job in dairy 
science

15:13.770 --> 15:39.120
however that's

15:13.770 --> 15:39.120
all

15:13.770 --> 15:39.120
right

15:51.350 --> 16:30.220
lockhart texas rock and dairy farm we have 600

15:51.350 --> 16:30.220
cows in a way i went down there

15:51.350 --> 16:30.220
and

15:51.350 --> 16:30.220
didn't get back in that three-year span that i had 
intended but in the meantime four years there and

16:30.200 --> 16:41.570
in the meantime had married and by the time i got 
back to the states i'd saved enough money to

16:53.700 --> 17:01.890
so in 1946 then i came back to study but i graduated 
in 1949 and you're also in gi bill yeah yeah that's

17:02.510 --> 17:08.130
right did you have no running a guy named ray hargis 
while you were a student yeah sure raised my cousin

17:08.110 --> 17:12.850
is that right yeah he'd been shot down in germany 41 
or 42 spent three years yeah you came back over here

17:12.830 --> 17:20.390
you bet that's interesting so uh so you came back in 
46 and then finished your degree in 49. i came back

17:22.880 --> 17:33.420
in uh

17:22.880 --> 17:33.420
was the uh the demand for was it tough to get into the 
school at that time do you remember in terms of

17:34.840 --> 17:47.060
numbers or yeah

18:01.550 --> 18:22.890
that's all right i was wondering because it's so 
competitive now i think i think it's a

18:01.550 --> 18:22.890
salient

18:22.870 --> 18:28.700
ethnicity that sounds about a lot i seem like i've 
seen that number that kind of number as well at that

18:30.900 --> 18:35.080
time what what did most of the students the 
veterinary students anticipate going into upon

18:35.060 --> 18:41.640
graduation in the private clinical practice in 
the country rural settings cattle business every

18:42.100 --> 18:59.760
large animal okay

18:42.100 --> 18:59.760
because i'm going to follow

18:42.100 --> 18:59.760
that i'll figure it out and be thought

18:59.740 --> 19:25.060
so i i guess it was that really so so

18:59.740 --> 19:25.060
when

18:59.740 --> 19:25.060
you got your degree what happened to you then you 
didn't go in private practicing no i'm the

19:25.040 --> 19:53.580
other side

19:25.040 --> 19:53.580
of it yeah

19:25.040 --> 19:53.580
anyway there's a little pretty

19:53.560 --> 20:19.510
good dairy well i had dairy science yes degree 
going to

19:53.560 --> 20:19.510
little

19:53.560 --> 20:19.510
places like that you couldn't you had to be 
somewhat of a generalist yeah nobody else there to

20:22.970 --> 20:52.570
concentrate on yeah well long and when

20:22.970 --> 20:52.570
i came back here

20:22.970 --> 20:52.570
the

20:22.970 --> 20:52.570
job is an instructor in their physiology with

20:52.550 --> 21:08.060
their physiology so i had had i've had army 
experience and the

21:08.040 --> 21:23.170
soldiers and then the experience there in the 
department and then i was about to graduate with

21:23.150 --> 21:33.540
the team dr john miller who was head of the 
department at

21:23.150 --> 21:33.540
the minimum day he just started the biology lab 
with to my side and said the prior said yeah

21:33.600 --> 21:57.150
we're going to clifton

21:33.600 --> 21:57.150
texas and practice said well why don't you think 
about it and that's all he said oh he asked me again

22:09.280 --> 22:33.310
he

22:09.280 --> 22:33.310
came back

22:09.280 --> 22:33.310
the third

22:09.280 --> 22:33.310
time and i thought well in the wrong maybe it was 
telling me something and uh finally he said on that

22:33.930 --> 22:37.230
third time he said i've got a job for you i

22:37.210 --> 22:46.890
said

22:37.210 --> 22:46.890
well i mean i need to think about it and i told my wife 
about it and i'll be back then i thought about it and

22:46.870 --> 22:53.180
thought well you know i'm gonna do it for you and 
then i can still go to clifton texas for the market

22:53.160 --> 23:04.540
so i came back and told him okay and uh he said well 
that's that's fine then you got the job i said so

23:04.520 --> 23:19.140
graduated and some was out and

23:04.520 --> 23:19.140
that i'm adamant with it says we're going to teach 
this

23:19.920 --> 23:26.950
an old one sessions what was the book yeah yeah i 
remember that title i i that's why i was asking

23:40.560 --> 23:46.980
s-i-s-s-o-n it's sisson and grossman i remember 
some of those old titles

24:05.840 --> 24:13.260
that's something else i kind of like to ask you 
about is the textbook and teaching side of it

24:13.320 --> 24:41.940
sometimes well he handed me that book all

24:13.320 --> 24:41.940
the instructions i had

24:13.320 --> 24:41.940
and

24:13.320 --> 24:41.940
obviously

24:13.320 --> 24:41.940
you enjoyed it what would have been the uh what was 
your salary starting salary do you remember my

24:41.920 --> 24:50.140
starting salary

24:50.120 --> 25:04.990
now how what would have been your comparable what 
would have been the situation had you gone into

25:04.970 --> 25:13.220
practice in clifton well of course clifton uh no 
longer is a dairy store so something else would

25:13.200 --> 25:21.860
have had to happen yeah but what kind of uh income or 
living would you have made had you gone into

25:21.840 --> 25:23.940
practice in clifton at that time i'd had to starve 
for about three years yeah that was a pretty

25:24.080 --> 25:29.300
standard procedure when it'd be tough to get into 
business now when when a practitioner like that

25:29.280 --> 25:34.460
went out into business on their own basically you 
hang a shingle up in your your own your own is it a

25:34.440 --> 25:43.280
matter of public relations a matter of something 
being available what what makes it work or not work

25:43.260 --> 25:56.940
people have to want

25:56.920 --> 26:23.140
to come to you

25:56.920 --> 26:23.140
sometimes

25:56.920 --> 26:23.140
you've got to do some things that you

25:56.920 --> 26:23.140
went out into practice then and now i guess this is a 
broad thing i've been kind of interested in was

26:28.270 --> 26:40.490
there or is there any business training for that 
veterinary

26:28.270 --> 26:40.490
main

26:28.270 --> 26:40.490
thing that i've heard

26:56.620 --> 27:04.400
yeah i'm wondering about that because you know 
just in the tvma meeting the other day

27:10.120 --> 27:14.770
i mean i know they're technicians too they're 
doctors but they're running businesses and those

27:14.750 --> 27:19.090
businesses some of them apparently were big 
operations i know i was talking to you know names to

27:19.950 --> 27:25.580
pinky uh in el paso i'm sorry but anyway yeah i'm 
hoping and i gathered he's not operating as a

27:25.720 --> 27:38.520
businessman you're

27:25.720 --> 27:38.520
running the business so that was just one aspect of 
the technology

27:38.500 --> 27:51.780
in there

27:38.500 --> 27:51.780
you know just not enough to make a businessman of 
course medical doctors have the same situation

27:51.760 --> 27:57.300
yeah that's correct now they will learn it yeah the 
hard way if you give them the business without the

27:57.280 --> 28:03.000
technology they can't learn and

28:02.980 --> 28:29.490
then

28:02.980 --> 28:29.490
they will learn on their own yeah yeah the business

28:02.980 --> 28:29.490
it'll finally

28:02.980 --> 28:29.490
when they go out of here in 1949 so did you have any 
idea what kind of charges you should make for

28:30.270 --> 28:36.130
services and anything like that yeah we talked 
about you had something a little bit and we also had

28:36.110 --> 28:44.990
the practitioners

29:11.640 --> 29:56.820
on the other hand even then and i guess

29:11.640 --> 29:56.820
even more after

29:11.640 --> 29:56.820
that you go out there and make a blunder in

29:56.800 --> 30:05.090
his practice already rooted and you'll come back 
to him so you you learn from him stakes at his

30:05.070 --> 30:07.170
expense rather than your own will you say that 
apprenticeship is is more common now than it was

30:16.570 --> 30:20.350
do most of your students now going out of here 
actually go into some sort of apprenticeship

30:20.330 --> 30:32.780
situation i guess nothing else having the capital 
to go into business so

30:20.330 --> 30:32.780
i know a lot of our analog years have known a lot many 
of them

30:32.760 --> 30:43.490
get into veterinary medicine because they like 
animals yeah one of the things you're telling me is

30:43.470 --> 30:47.990
that maybe the most important thing is that they 
they like people if they don't like people they

30:47.970 --> 30:54.570
better not be people yeah i'm sure you scream or in 
the you know the interview process that you go

30:54.870 --> 30:59.770
through do you try i mean for their own good i will 
assume has that always happened did that happen in

30:59.750 --> 31:07.780
1949 well i don't know in 1949 and i wasn't on the 
admission yeah

31:07.760 --> 31:17.220
i don't know we've tried through the years

31:20.280 --> 31:24.380
it's hard to it's hard to better and it's 
subjective as it can be but yeah they make an effort

31:25.080 --> 31:31.900
to that's a good question how would you describe a 
profile of a a typical veterinarian or a student or

31:31.960 --> 31:39.030
someone that you think should be in that kind of 
business? Do you have an image of a veterinarian?

31:45.200 --> 31:47.220
An image of what a veterinarian ought to be? What is 
that? My image may be false, may be false. Number

31:55.200 --> 32:47.980
one, he's got to be

31:55.200 --> 32:47.980
skilled.

32:47.960 --> 32:51.510
Visual capability, perceiving what that was. A 
skill, that's a lesson.

32:59.720 --> 33:16.740
Today we have,

32:59.720 --> 33:16.740
but we are losers.

33:16.720 --> 33:18.740
So it's more technology-oriented than... Well, 
we didn't have the technology. So we had to do it.

33:34.310 --> 34:27.240
Intuition

33:34.310 --> 34:27.240
to, say, a traumatic

33:34.310 --> 34:27.240
prayer

33:34.310 --> 34:27.240
card.

34:37.080 --> 34:39.100
Well, sure enough, she did. Certain

34:39.080 --> 34:51.630
signs that he had seen so many times. He knew what 
they were. He didn't have to... Now, that is skill,

34:53.610 --> 35:27.860
but it's also art.

35:27.840 --> 35:28.861
Literally, that's what's happening. And 
inflammation

35:28.840 --> 35:44.420
and infection.

35:44.400 --> 35:47.840
It was traumatic. So they need...

35:58.680 --> 36:02.780
A veterinarian is someone who is technically 
skilled and accurate. Yeah. This day and time, he

36:04.574 --> 36:06.630
has to have the tech. Non-invasive

36:06.610 --> 36:28.996
tech.

36:29.217 --> 36:32.220
You can see what's inside without invading the 
body. You can

36:32.200 --> 36:49.090
see

36:32.200 --> 36:49.090
what's in there. I'm not

36:49.070 --> 37:08.520
saying that's

36:49.070 --> 37:08.520
wrong. So he got to have the technology this day and 
time.

37:56.760 --> 37:57.781
Well, I just love animals. So that is an

37:57.760 --> 38:07.270
innate part of veterinary medicine. It is an 
infection, let's say, Brian. Oh, yeah. On the

38:14.261 --> 38:22.140
other hand, we can't overlook

38:14.261 --> 38:22.140
working for a client. And

38:22.120 --> 38:27.400
you've got to face those two off.

38:30.570 --> 38:32.590
There are times when you can't do what you wanted. 
And

38:32.570 --> 38:48.690
you know that you could make that animal

38:32.570 --> 38:48.690
do what you really wanted to do. But you can't 
afford to do it because it would cost more than that

38:48.670 --> 39:00.390
animal is worth.

39:00.370 --> 39:02.390
And insurance covers it or something. On that same 
line, I don't know if this is the right place to go.

39:05.370 --> 39:08.390
We need to get back to the profile of a 
veterinarian. But as I see it, too, one of the

39:08.370 --> 39:17.510
difficulties in promoting or advancing the 
practice of veterinary medicine has been the

39:08.370 --> 39:17.510
problem of cost. And so, for example, in fact, I was 
raised with the idea that animals are basically

39:17.490 --> 39:25.140
expendable, that you don't spend money on them. I 
never spent a nickel on a pet. They were always

39:27.120 --> 39:30.140
free, and if they died, tough. You don't do that. I 
spend a lot. That's an old agrarian philosophy,

39:32.120 --> 39:34.140
though. That's right. I have dogs now. Yeah. And so 
forth. Yeah. And your high-priced equipment

39:40.996 --> 39:45.420
you're talking about is expensive stuff. 
Absolutely. So has part of the problem of

39:46.343 --> 39:54.990
veterinary medicine, you think, been convincing 
people that they need to invest in their animals?

39:54.970 --> 39:56.990
I'm not sure if I'm asking that question 
correctly. That somehow or other, in other words,

39:56.970 --> 40:05.140
you can prove the efficiencies, the cost 
efficiencies of taking care of animals. Is that

40:05.120 --> 40:10.580
part of the message that veterinarians have had to 
get across in this opportunity? Well, you know,

40:10.560 --> 41:09.180
all that

40:10.560 --> 41:09.180
in there,

40:10.560 --> 41:09.180
and you've got to

40:10.560 --> 41:09.180
weasel that out of the

40:10.560 --> 41:09.180
people

40:10.560 --> 41:09.180
of

40:10.560 --> 41:09.180
your clients. Your dog can't

41:09.160 --> 41:33.160
take it, and that's where they're

41:09.160 --> 41:33.160
going

41:09.160 --> 41:33.160
somewhere else. And that's the way you build your 
business. Has that changed over the years?

41:39.840 --> 41:52.500
...were a

41:39.840 --> 41:52.500
means of production. There wasn't necessarily 
a...

42:04.200 --> 42:16.470
But as people move to the city, as they have pets for 
whatever reasons, there's a completely

42:04.200 --> 42:16.470
different...

42:16.450 --> 42:18.470
Because she's got one set of values. There

42:18.450 --> 42:31.660
are great extremes in this animal rights tactic. 
And

42:31.640 --> 42:41.300
then there are those who... We need to be as 
human...

42:56.200 --> 43:36.860
Humanitarian

42:56.200 --> 43:36.860
as we can

42:56.200 --> 43:36.860
possibly

42:56.200 --> 43:36.860
be.

43:36.840 --> 43:54.060
And if

43:36.840 --> 43:54.060
you do that,

43:36.840 --> 43:54.060
you satisfy the... And some of the others over on 
this other side say, well, that's stupid. You're

43:59.320 --> 44:11.130
just...

43:59.320 --> 44:11.130
Veterinarians

43:59.320 --> 44:11.130
ought to be standing for humani... Humanitarian, 
I guess. Humanitarian.

44:18.989 --> 44:25.710
Under their control, or...

44:25.690 --> 44:32.170
So, we need to do everything that we can to give that 
animal... Money comes into

44:32.150 --> 44:41.810
the picture. No question about that. But 
sometimes you can't. Don't pay the bill. Well, if

44:50.080 --> 44:51.101
you don't... Your business is going to fail. And 
you've got to... But

44:58.480 --> 45:04.950
humanitarianism is a very essential part. If you 
dislike animals, you ought not be there. There's

45:10.230 --> 45:27.730
an extreme

45:10.230 --> 45:27.730
that the...

45:27.710 --> 45:34.432
Humanitarian...

45:35.272 --> 47:05.680
It would slide.
