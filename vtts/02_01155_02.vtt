WEBVTT

00:01.803 --> 00:07.211
We'll just talk about it because it's... 
Somebody, who was it? The University Archives

00:07.231 --> 00:14.262
came to me about three or four years ago. And a bunch 
of what you've asked is... You've got it. Well, let

00:17.286 --> 00:18.247
me go get that tape. I didn't realize that. Okay, 
Charles Schulz or Dave Chapman. Well, I forgot

00:21.332 --> 00:25.058
now, but I'm going to copy it and give it to you. All 
right.

00:30.001 --> 00:42.558
One thing you mentioned there about practice, 
there is an

00:30.001 --> 00:42.558
effort, at least, to say that every veterinarian 
practices his profession. Now, there are those

00:43.680 --> 00:50.149
who say that, well, practice is private clinical 
practice. Well, there is private clinical

00:50.289 --> 00:54.975
practice, but there's more practice than that. I 
practice my profession in academia. Good. That's

00:59.571 --> 01:01.533
a good point. Because I was defining practice as 
being in the business of veterinary medicine, the

01:01.953 --> 01:07.179
private enterprise. Most people do. And then they 
say, well, you other guys are not practicing. We

01:11.463 --> 01:12.785
feel like we're practicing. Well, that's a good 
point. That will help me relieve some of the

01:14.667 --> 01:20.192
tensions I see between the two areas. So we're all 
on the same plot there and all seeking to do the same

01:20.272 --> 01:24.677
thing. And that is, the end result is, a service to 
the people that they can't do themselves for a fee.

01:36.698 --> 01:44.625
Now, we don't charge a fee, but we get people who can 
charge a fee, see, when they're out in private

01:36.698 --> 01:44.625
practice. We're not private clinical 
practitioners. Not even our veterinary hospital

01:47.968 --> 01:51.872
here is not private. It's a public entity. So it's 
not private, but it's practice, nevertheless.

01:58.983 --> 02:00.364
Well, anyway, let's go back to the front.

02:04.028 --> 02:04.749
Are you a Texan? Yeah. Born and reared in Erath 
County, Texas. Yeah. I was born to a farm family. My

02:15.899 --> 02:17.181
daddy was a farmer. He was a Sandyland peanut 
farmer. He also later got into the beef cattle

02:21.745 --> 02:28.011
business and was a beef cattle producer. My 
grandfather, he got into it because of my

02:29.206 --> 02:32.851
grandfather. My mother's father, not his own. His 
only father died before I was ever born. But my

02:39.301 --> 02:48.033
mother's daddy was in the beef cattle business and 
bred and sold old her for cattle. And he wasn't in

02:49.415 --> 02:58.048
the slaughter

02:49.415 --> 02:58.048
grade kind of production. But he sold bulls to all 
over the country. When did he get into that? Ooh.

03:09.648 --> 03:10.129
I don't know. Can't tell you. The year or anything 
like that. In the 20s or 30s? No, it's early. Is that

03:14.894 --> 03:15.734
right? The reason I ask, I have an uncle who was in 
Louisiana, but he was in the purebred hereford

03:15.795 --> 03:23.582
business. And it was apparently, even in the 40s 
and, or so, 30s, I guess, when he got into it. It was a

03:28.349 --> 03:29.951
novel kind of thing. There wasn't much of a 
chemistry. Well, of course, my grandfather on the

03:32.274 --> 03:43.309
other side, we had the old Herford's who came to 
Texas from supposedly Mississippi. And he never

03:43.329 --> 03:53.382
would reveal where he came from specifically and 
never would reveal any of his kinfolks. We wonder

03:53.952 --> 03:58.919
if he had to skip country or something like that, 
you know? He had an expression in Louisiana, going

03:58.999 --> 04:01.362
to Texas. It meant something. Anyway, he couldn't 
read and write. He couldn't even count. One, two,

04:12.297 --> 04:16.223
three, four, like that. But he died. He had 33,000 
acres of land and a whole bunch of perfect cattle.

04:24.091 --> 04:34.609
And did pretty well, but he came to Texas and Denton 
County and he went to work for an old fella that

04:24.091 --> 04:34.609
lived there in Denton County on a little farm, just 
day labor. And he did it with a pretty good hand and

04:34.629 --> 04:47.671
his

04:34.629 --> 04:47.671
employer then decided to, you know, he'd rent to 
him on the haves. He'd furnish all the mules and

04:48.352 --> 04:50.115
everything. hornets and the plows and the seed and 
they'd split the profits at the end. And then he did

04:56.978 --> 05:05.170
that for a while and decided he wanted to go 
three-fourths and so he got his own mules and

04:56.978 --> 05:05.170
farmed the land. And then the next step was he 
bought the land right out of scratch. And from

05:12.261 --> 05:15.766
there he got on up into the cattle business. Well, 
anyway. My daddy got into the beef cattle business

05:17.568 --> 05:24.918
because of my mother's father, really. But 
principally, he was a farmer.

05:31.006 --> 05:43.123
Well, having grown up there in Erath County and 
Sandeman,

05:31.006 --> 05:43.123
there wasn't anything there for me when I 
graduated from high school. So I went to the oil

05:43.143 --> 05:47.068
field in Fort Worth, Texas. Do you remember what 
year was that? That was 1935.

05:54.257 --> 06:07.076
And from there, well, in there I worked in the Alamo 
refinery, what was then called Wittenberg. And it

06:07.096 --> 06:15.047
later changed to Phillips, but it's a little 
subdivision outside of the border of Texas. I

06:15.067 --> 06:18.372
worked in the Alamo refinery, the gasoline 
refinery there. And I was in with some guys that

06:18.858 --> 06:23.445
were 30 years old, and I was 17 years old, right off 
the farm. Green is gold, you know. And those guys

06:27.310 --> 06:30.715
had been working in the oil field for a long time. 
They knew how to play all night from the foreman,

06:30.735 --> 06:35.021
you know, all that stuff. And they treated me like I 
was their son, I guess. The great guys, you know,

06:43.613 --> 07:01.574
they were giving me the shirt off their back, but 
they were vile, and they were vulgar, and their

06:43.613 --> 07:01.574
language was terrible, and they were always 
kidding with me, you know, and sending me over to

06:43.613 --> 07:01.574
get something that didn't even exist or 
something, you know, just pranks. Well, I liked

07:01.594 --> 07:06.359
those guys, but at the end of the year, I thought, 
well, there's got to be something better than

07:01.594 --> 07:06.359
this. So I quit, and I came back home to Erath 
County. And thinking about going to college, I

07:15.035 --> 07:23.863
thought about several universities and 
colleges. I decided I was a Baptist and my family

07:23.883 --> 07:29.488
was a Baptist. I went over to Baylor, I guess. I went 
over to Baylor University. Got a job. Had to have a

07:34.653 --> 07:36.574
job where I couldn't go. So I got a job sweeping 
sidewalks to begin with. Went back home and told

07:40.137 --> 07:44.181
Dad about it. He said, well, Al, I just, you know, 
I'm concerned about it. I'm afraid you're going to

07:49.153 --> 07:56.921
get over there and get started, and then the 
money's going to run out, and you just can't

07:49.153 --> 07:56.921
finish. This was before I went to the oil field. I 
got to the oil field. This was before the oil field.

08:06.532 --> 08:10.476
And he said, he's just afraid that I couldn't make 
it. And that night, I thought, well, you know,

08:11.077 --> 08:14.961
Dad's pretty smart, and I am. Maybe he's right. So I 
went back to Waco and told him I wasn't coming. Went

08:26.358 --> 08:32.245
on back home, and then I went to the oil field, 
Porter, Texas, and then had that experience

08:26.358 --> 08:32.245
there. Well, when I came back home that time, then 
Dad was in no position to help me. It was right after

08:39.974 --> 08:45.640
we began to come out of the Great Depression, and he 
just didn't have it. scratching out of living

08:46.008 --> 08:52.655
there in that little sand hill in the farm. So he 
said, well, let's go over to Deion and see if I can

08:52.675 --> 09:05.888
mortgage a heifer or something

08:52.675 --> 09:05.888
and get you a little money to go. We went over to 
Deion. We borrowed $25 to mortgage the old heifer.

09:12.034 --> 09:13.095
He gave me that $25, and I went to talk to him. Then we 
had the new deal.

09:20.390 --> 09:23.533
$25 is what I had to have to pay down. And I could pay 
the rest out over a period of time. So I had to have a

09:27.657 --> 09:30.840
job again. And a guy came along that was a, I guess 
you'd call him the garbage collector. He was going

09:37.046 --> 09:39.007
around town picking up garbage. And out at the edge 
of town he had a hog farm. And he'd take my garbage

09:42.590 --> 09:45.653
out to feed his hogs. So he gave me a job. And that's 
what I did, was go around and pick up that garbage

09:46.835 --> 09:53.843
and go out and feed the hogs. And that way, I was able 
to make enough to make it through Tarleton.

10:01.311 --> 10:02.733
Finished Tarleton in a couple of years. It was a 
junior college then. And then I wanted to come to

10:05.616 --> 10:08.700
Texas. So I talked to Dad again. I paid all my debts 
there, but I didn't have enough money to cover

10:11.108 --> 10:15.856
debts. My dad said, well, let's go back to the bank. 
And we went back to the bank, and we parted $50. And I

10:24.189 --> 10:30.720
stood at the edge of Stephenville, Texas, and put a 
ride down on a flatbed truck. The guy that was going

10:31.139 --> 10:36.727
to Houston threw my luggage on the back end of that 
truck, and here we went. I sat back there, and the

10:36.747 --> 10:41.534
wind was blowing, and I was nearly blowing off of 
that. He stopped at the East Gate over there, and I

10:41.634 --> 10:50.987
got off with my luggage, and I started walking up to 
the big old pillars there. And I said, an old

10:51.007 --> 10:56.695
country boy like me can't do this. I turned around, 
and I started back. down to Texas Avenue, to get you

10:59.725 --> 11:03.891
right back home. I can't do that. Then I said to 
myself, you idiot. You're an idiot, just a plain

11:07.937 --> 11:10.340
idiot. So I turned around and went on back up there. 
Well, fortunately, at Tarleton, there was a

11:13.365 --> 11:24.020
veterinarian that taught me dairy science at 
Tarleton, a portion of dairy science. His name was

11:24.040 --> 11:25.783
Vern Scott. There is a Vern Scott Jr. today 
practicing there. This is Vern Scott Sr. and he's

11:31.125 --> 11:33.088
deceased. He was our veterinarian out on the 
ranching industry that Dad had, small but little.

11:43.163 --> 11:45.768
And I'd watched him, you know, come out there. He'd 
come out there and do some work. He interested me

11:47.768 --> 11:54.237
very much, and I guess he is really the source of my 
interest in veterinary medicine. Because

11:54.257 --> 11:55.579
usually there is someone like that. I was going to 
ask you if you've been a county agent or a

11:55.599 --> 12:00.447
vocational ag teacher or what, but it was this guy. 
Yeah, Dr. Vern Scott. And he knew Dr. C.N.

12:06.856 --> 12:09.279
Shepardson, Mr. C.N. Shepardson it was, who used 
to be dean of agriculture here. Before that, he was

12:13.205 --> 12:15.829
head of the Department of Dairy Science. Yeah. And 
he and Vern Scott had a relationship. And Vern

12:21.145 --> 12:34.397
Scott told me that when you get down there, if you 
have any problems or anything like that or you need

12:21.145 --> 12:34.397
some help or something, you go over to see Mr. 
Shepherds and just tell him what it is. And he's a

12:34.477 --> 12:36.839
guy that'll help you. Well, I want to study 
veterinary medicine. He was over in dairy

12:38.401 --> 12:39.762
science. So I went to the College of Veterinary 
Medicine the then dean of veterinary medicine,

12:46.173 --> 12:56.403
what was his name? Oh, Dr. Maff, no one. The second 
dean. Marsteller. Marsteller, yeah,

13:01.668 --> 13:03.990
Marsteller, of course. I don't know why. Yeah, me 
too, I went blank. Marsteller was dean there, and I

13:07.333 --> 13:14.560
went over to Dr. Marsteller and told him I wanted to 
study veterinary medicine, and he said, well,

13:07.333 --> 13:14.560
fine. And I said, well, we've got to have a job. He 
said, well, that may be a problem. He said, it's

13:19.407 --> 13:28.254
getting a little late in the summer, and all the 
jobs we're going to have for students have already

13:19.407 --> 13:28.254
been committed for this fall. And I just don't, 
just can't give you any more. And I, oh, I may have to

13:33.138 --> 13:36.922
go back home. But I remembered what Dr. Vern Scott 
told me. Go over and see Mr. Shepard's. So I ambled

13:45.168 --> 13:52.216
over to Mr. Shepardson's office over in that 
agricultural building, still standing there.

13:52.236 --> 13:55.660
And his office was in there. And told him who I was. 
And that Colonel Scott told me to come see him. He

14:01.947 --> 14:08.614
agreed with me and said, well, yeah, I think we can 
get you a job down on the dairy farm. We'll find one.

14:10.677 --> 14:14.601
Now, you'd have to be a dairy science major, 
however, and can't work over there. Well, I want to

14:17.343 --> 14:22.428
study veterinary medicine, but I couldn't do 
that, and I couldn't without a job. Well, maybe I

14:22.448 --> 14:24.229
better go the other way. At least I'll be in 
college. So I went over. I told him, I'll take it.

14:29.434 --> 14:40.865
And so he did, and I cleaned the barn, milked cows, 
and mowed grass for 25 cents an hour over there in

14:29.434 --> 14:40.865
dairy science. I graduated from dairy science in 
1940. I had every intention of going into, going to

14:44.703 --> 14:55.276
work somewhere, I wasn't sure what, with a B.S. 
degree and trying to save enough money to come back

14:55.356 --> 15:04.006
to veterinary

14:55.356 --> 15:04.006
medicine. So... What kind of job opportunities 
were there then for B.S. in animal science? Pretty

15:10.153 --> 15:10.974
good? Yeah, I think so. I got a job before the summer 
was out. Graduated in May of 40, and before the

15:17.323 --> 15:20.868
summer was out, I had a job. There was a guy in Dairy 
Science, however, who coached the judging

15:23.232 --> 15:38.637
team.

15:38.657 --> 15:40.039
That's all right. But anyway, he got me a job in 
Lockhart,

15:42.297 --> 16:03.359
Texas on the Rock and Berry farm

15:42.297 --> 16:03.359
down there. The guy with the name of Wilson managed 
it. We had 600 cows. And most of the milk went to

16:05.321 --> 16:07.844
Austin. Anyway, I went down there and started 
working the fall of Well late summer of 1940 and

16:11.930 --> 16:40.536
then of course stayed there until World War II 
broke out and I'd been through the Corps of Cadets

16:11.930 --> 16:40.536
and the Reserve Officer and when World War II broke 
out of course I got called in right away and didn't

16:11.930 --> 16:40.536
get back in that three year span that I had intended 
but in the meantime the war went on, spent four

16:11.930 --> 16:40.536
little four years there And in the meantime, had 
married. And by the time I got back to the States,

16:43.406 --> 16:54.586
I'd saved enough money to come to College of 
Veterinary Medicine. So in 1946, then, I came back

16:54.606 --> 17:02.080
to study veterinary medicine and graduated in 
1949. Well, you were also in the GI Bill. Yeah.

17:05.146 --> 17:05.967
Yeah, that's right. Did you run into a guy named Ray 
Hargis while you were a student? Yeah, sure. Ray's

17:10.017 --> 17:10.678
my cousin. Is that right? Yeah, he'd been shot down 
in Germany in 41 or 42, spent three years in prison

17:11.779 --> 17:17.987
and came back over here. Yeah, you bet. That's 
interesting. You bet. So you came back in 46 and

17:23.054 --> 17:26.959
then finished your degree in 49. Came back in 
February of 46. Was the demand for it, was it tough

17:32.677 --> 17:36.862
to get into the school at that time? Do you 
remember? In terms of numbers or? Well, the

17:42.650 --> 17:49.078
numbers weren't as fast as they are today. They had 
some more variation. But my class started

17:52.963 --> 18:01.013
with, well, I'm almost afraid to tell you the exact 
numbers now. That's all right. I was wondering

18:02.877 --> 18:06.322
because it's so competitive now to get in there. We 
lost a bunch. More had that

18:09.366 --> 18:14.013
classroom failed out. That started

18:14.033 --> 18:21.283
when I started. We graduated on 44 students. I 
think it was 72 students that started. That sounds

18:25.329 --> 18:26.330
about right. I seem like I've seen that number, 
that camera number as well. At that time, what did

18:31.047 --> 18:37.734
most of the students, the veterinary students, 
anticipate going into upon graduation? Private

18:37.754 --> 18:38.875
clinical practice. In the private clinical 
practice. In the country, rural settings, cattle

18:40.797 --> 18:44.081
business, everything? Large animals. Large 
animals. Okay. I'm going to follow that a little

18:45.723 --> 18:48.786
bit with you later. Yeah, that was what I had my 
practice place picked out before I graduated. You

18:55.433 --> 18:56.194
were as good. I didn't go in there, but I...

19:04.585 --> 19:10.171
So I guess it was Vern Scott that really kicked it 
off for me. And then...

19:11.032 --> 19:23.404
Well, I think that was

19:11.032 --> 19:23.404
the main... So when you got your degree, what 
happened to you then? You didn't go in private? I

19:26.971 --> 19:53.165
was going to

19:26.971 --> 19:53.165
Cleveland,

19:26.971 --> 19:53.165
a

19:26.971 --> 19:53.165
little town on the other side

19:26.971 --> 19:53.165
of Wake. Close to Crankville, yeah. And it was a 
pretty good dairy shed. Well I had a Dairy Science

20:02.792 --> 20:05.335
B.S. Degree in D.V.M. and what I planned to do was 
become a dairy practitioner, dairy cattle, and

20:07.817 --> 20:18.128
concentrate on dairy cattle. Going to little 
places like that you couldn't, you had to be

20:18.148 --> 20:23.353
somewhat of a generalist. because there's nobody 
else there to concentrate on. Well, long in the

20:30.297 --> 20:51.484
fourth year

20:30.297 --> 20:51.484
before we graduated, when I came back here and 
started veterinary medicine,

20:51.818 --> 21:05.515
I got a job as an instructor in the Department of 
Veterinary Physiology, and I was teaching

20:51.818 --> 21:05.515
in Veterinary Physiology. So I'd had Army 
experience and had taught in the Army, trained

21:05.535 --> 21:20.813
soldiers, and then the experience there in the 
Department of Veterinary Physiology.

21:21.333 --> 21:25.780
Then I was about to graduate with a Ph.D. degree. 
And Dr. John Miller, who was head of the Department

21:25.800 --> 21:44.789
of Anatomy, in the laboratory one day, histology 
laboratory, he came to my side and said, Price,

21:25.800 --> 21:44.789
have you ever thought about teaching? I said, no. 
He said, what are you going to do? I said, I'm going

21:48.395 --> 21:49.737
to shift. I'm going

21:50.206 --> 22:00.637
to Clifton, Texas. I'm going to Clifton, Texas and 
practice bear catching.

22:10.647 --> 22:12.709
He said, well, why don't you think about it? And 
that's all he said. I don't know what he wants. He

22:15.632 --> 22:16.132
still wouldn't buy it. And he asked me again about 
the possibility of going into teaching. I said,

22:17.514 --> 22:18.014
no, I don't know. Practice bear catching is what he 
intended the whole time. And

22:20.041 --> 22:26.651
he didn't argue with me or anything. But he came 
back the third time. And I thought, well, I'm

22:29.796 --> 22:30.416
wrong. Maybe it was telling him something. And 
finally he said on that third time, he said, I've

22:33.281 --> 22:43.155
got a job for

22:33.281 --> 22:43.155
you if you pay me. And I said, well, I'm going to come 
home and think about it and talk to my wife about it.

22:45.719 --> 22:46.200
I'll be back for you. Then I thought about it and 
thought, well, you know, I'm going to do it for a

22:47.024 --> 22:52.171
living. And then I can still go to Texas for the 
market. So I came back and told him, OK. And he said,

22:57.497 --> 23:04.927
well, that's fine. Then you got the job. I said, OK. 
So graduated, summer was out, fall came.

23:13.163 --> 23:20.235
Sessions?

23:20.556 --> 23:25.204
What was the

23:20.556 --> 23:25.204
book? Sessions? Yeah. Yeah, I remember that 
title. That's why I'm asking. I've got the old

23:33.499 --> 23:36.083
edition. It's Sisson. Sisson, is it? Yeah. 
S-I-S-S-O-N. It's Sisson and Grossman. I

23:46.494 --> 23:48.557
remember some of those old titles. Sisson and 
Grossman.

23:53.425 --> 23:53.726
Excuse me. Go ahead.

24:06.050 --> 24:14.061
That's something else I'd kind of like to ask you 
about, is the textbook and teaching side of it

24:06.050 --> 24:14.061
sometimes. Well, he handed me that book, and of 
course I had been through the book and had me in

24:14.141 --> 24:20.409
school. That textbook we used. And he handed me the 
book and said, that's what you're going to teach.

24:27.739 --> 24:29.441
And that's all the instructions I had.

24:32.906 --> 24:34.808
So I started teaching. And never left.

24:40.819 --> 24:42.121
And obviously you enjoyed it. What would have been 
the, what was your salary, starting salary, do you

24:42.141 --> 24:47.088
remember? $3,200 a year. I always remember my 
starting salary,

24:49.151 --> 24:54.179
too. I have every payday in my drawer right there. 
Yeah. What would have been the situation had you

25:01.872 --> 25:07.582
gone into practice in Clifton? Well, of course, 
Clifton no longer is a dairy share. So something

25:12.630 --> 25:15.695
else would have had to happen. And what would have 
happened, I have no idea. What kind of an income or

25:17.919 --> 25:24.309
living would you have made had you gone into 
practice in Clifton at that time? I'd had to starve

25:24.329 --> 25:26.513
for about three years. Yeah, that was a pretty 
standard procedure when it'd be tough to get into

25:26.780 --> 25:30.744
the business. Absolutely. Now, when a 
practitioner like that went out into business on

25:31.505 --> 25:44.680
their own, basically you hang a shingle up and 
you're on your own, is it a matter of good public

25:31.505 --> 25:44.680
relations, a matter of someone being available? 
What makes it work or not work? Mostly public

25:46.842 --> 25:48.223
relations. Public relations. You've got to do a 
good job. Yeah, sure. Technical work. Yeah.

25:54.490 --> 25:55.251
That's true, but People have to want to come to you. 
They've got to like you. I don't care if you're good

26:00.306 --> 26:02.810
at your technology. People will like you. They're 
not going to come to you. And that's what some

26:06.636 --> 26:09.119
veterinarians miss. You've got to satisfy them. 
And sometimes you've got to do some things that you

26:13.085 --> 26:18.433
don't think was best, but they thought was best. 
Now, when a veterinarian went out into practice

26:20.496 --> 26:24.883
then and now, I guess, this is a little bit broad, 
I've been kind of interested in, was there or is

26:25.741 --> 26:33.189
there any business training for that veterinary? 
Very little. And still today, much too little. The

26:39.015 --> 26:54.752
main thing that I've heard through the years, 
being here at the College of Veterinary Medicine,

26:39.015 --> 26:54.752
of people who left here, gone to here, and then 
feeding information back as to what they needed

26:39.015 --> 26:54.752
most during that first five years of the practice 
was some business I'm

26:55.508 --> 27:10.284
wondering about that because, you know, just in 
that TVMA meeting the other day, it came

26:55.508 --> 27:10.284
immediately clear to me these people are 
basically businessmen, it seemed to me. I mean,

27:10.304 --> 27:11.646
they're technicians, too. They're doctors. But 
they're running businesses, and those

27:13.227 --> 27:18.373
businesses, some of them apparently were big 
operations. I know I was talking to... His name

27:20.500 --> 27:23.524
took pinky in El Paso. I'm sorry, but anyway. Yeah, 
I know. And I gathered he's done a lot of operating

27:27.609 --> 27:34.298
as a businessman as much as anybody else. Sure, 
yes. And a lot of these people have. You run in the

27:36.040 --> 27:36.962
business. That's correct. So that was just one 
aspect that I was sort of intrigued about. Well, in

27:41.788 --> 27:45.613
the period of time, to get the technology in, there 
is just not enough time to make a businessman. Of

27:52.002 --> 27:53.823
course, medical doctors have the same situation. 
Yeah, that's correct. Now, they will learn it the

27:55.045 --> 27:58.208
hard way. If you give them the business without the 
technology, they can't learn that the hard way. So

28:05.975 --> 28:12.862
you've got to give them the technology, the arts 
and skills of the practice of living medicine. And

28:12.882 --> 28:14.183
then they will learn. On their own, the business, 
it'll finally, for most of them, they'll melt.

28:24.295 --> 28:28.359
Now, there are some that can, and they fade from the 
scene. When they go out of here, now or in 1949, did

28:28.379 --> 28:36.706
you have any idea what kind of charges you should 
make for services and anything like that? Yeah, we

28:37.847 --> 28:41.691
talked about that a little bit in school. And we 
also had the practitioners private clinical

28:46.057 --> 28:55.311
practitioners who would come and talk with us in a 
seminar or talk to the class about their

28:46.057 --> 28:55.311
experiences. And that was good education. They 
donated their time. And we'd ask them questions.

29:05.225 --> 29:08.390
What do you charge for so-and-so? They'd get a 
pretty good idea. On the other hand, even then, and

29:11.915 --> 29:15.861
I guess even more after that, graduates were 
encouraged not to go directly into your private

29:17.309 --> 29:24.198
clinical practice. Go to work for a veterinarian. 
Observe what it is out there in the real world. This

29:30.266 --> 29:40.700
veterinary hospital here is great, but it doesn't 
teach you the business end of that, nor the public

29:30.266 --> 29:40.700
relations end of that, the personal end of that. 
And you learn that by just observing out there and

29:40.720 --> 29:45.587
working with a veterinarian. Number one is, If you 
go out there and you make a blunder in your

29:46.587 --> 29:55.237
practice, people are not going to come back to you. 
You go out there and make a blunder in his practice,

29:55.738 --> 29:58.802
and he's already rooted. And they'll come back to 
him. So you learn from him and do your mistakes at

30:01.245 --> 30:07.172
his expense rather than your own. Well, you say 
that apprenticeship is more common now than it

30:08.593 --> 30:16.263
was, say, earlier today. Yeah. do most of your 
students now going out of here actually go into

30:16.709 --> 30:22.255
some sort of apprenticeship situation? I guess, 
if nothing else, having the capital to go into

30:22.315 --> 30:28.222
business would be a pretty big outlier. Well, of 
course it was. So I know a lot of our years have known

30:30.945 --> 30:34.809
a lot of vet students. Many of them

30:36.511 --> 30:43.459
get into veterinary medicine because they like 
animals. And yet one of the things you're telling

30:44.755 --> 30:50.083
me is that maybe the most important thing is that 
they like people. Well, if they don't like people,

30:50.103 --> 30:53.288
it doesn't matter to them. They just eat the 
people. Yeah, sure. Do you screen, or in the

30:54.911 --> 31:01.141
interview process that you go through, do you try, 
I mean, for their own good, I would assume. Has that

31:03.464 --> 31:04.426
always happened? Did that happen in 1949? Well, I 
don't know of 1949. I wasn't on the admission

31:09.113 --> 31:11.016
agenda. I don't know, but we've tried through the 
years to build that in. It's hard to build and it's

31:20.474 --> 31:28.261
subjective as it can be, but yeah, I'd make an 
effort to. That's a good question. How would you

31:29.002 --> 31:39.291
describe or profile a typical veterinarian or a 
student or someone that you think should be in that

31:29.002 --> 31:39.291
kind of business? Do you have an image of a 
veterinarian?

31:44.290 --> 31:47.014
I have an image of what a veterinarian ought to be. 
What is that? Yes. And my image may be false. I'm

31:53.604 --> 31:54.145
sure. It may be false. Number one, he's got to be 
accurate. Accuracy of the technology, the skill,

32:03.619 --> 32:10.028
the art. And you know, we've lost a great part of the 
art. Dr. A. A. Leonard,

32:17.186 --> 32:33.870
who used to be the head of the clinics,

32:17.186 --> 32:33.870
was an artist.

32:33.890 --> 32:39.819
He could go out there and look at an animal and say, 
he's got so-and-so. He didn't have to test. I don't

32:41.061 --> 32:42.563
mean he didn't have to test, but...

32:46.238 --> 32:51.766
had the visual capability of perceiving what that 
was. And that's an art. That's not a skill. That's

32:54.670 --> 32:55.752
an art. You work on that. Today, we have tests, 
tests, tests, tests, tests, you see. And there's

33:05.566 --> 33:06.988
nothing wrong with tests. But we are losing the art 
of the practice

33:07.729 --> 33:14.018
of . I don't want to put words in your mouth. Getting 
into more skills. So it's more

33:16.894 --> 33:19.777
technology-oriented than... Absolutely. Well, 
we didn't have the technology. So we had to do the

33:23.660 --> 33:27.884
art. And, you know, when I say art and skills, I 
guess art is a skill, too, but... No, I don't

33:27.904 --> 33:38.072
understand. The intuition to say, that's that. 
Well, I know that, for instance, way back there in

33:44.069 --> 34:12.895
the 1930's, Byrne Scott

33:44.069 --> 34:12.895
came to our place, and Daddy called him, and he 
came, and Daddy had a cow in the corral, and she

33:44.069 --> 34:12.895
wasn't doing anything with it, although Daddy 
obviously knew she was ill. Dr. Bernard Scott

34:13.702 --> 34:15.985
looked over the fence and said, yeah. Says she has 
hardware disease. I said, what's hardware

34:21.572 --> 34:24.596
disease? He says it's traumatic pericarditis. 
That's important. You know? Cleared that right

34:32.506 --> 34:33.347
out.

34:36.888 --> 34:38.029
Well, sure enough, she did. There were certain 
signs and symptoms that that animal displayed

34:40.651 --> 34:52.922
that he had seen so many times that he knew what that 
was. He didn't have to go any further. Now, that is

34:54.964 --> 34:58.847
skill, but it's also art. And we have lost a lot of 
that. You know, the old cow, he's ticked. She's got

35:06.352 --> 35:11.358
metal in her, pericardium in her heart. She 
swallows a nail or a wire or something. It goes into

35:15.063 --> 35:16.585
the stomach, into the rumen. The rumen sits just 
behind the diaphragm, and the heart's over on this

35:17.106 --> 35:21.932
side beating. And you try to put a hammer on the 
handle by hitting one end. So literally, that's

35:27.539 --> 35:29.421
what's happening. And the little heart's sitting 
there beating. It just draws that thing right

35:32.245 --> 35:34.047
through the... diaphragm and into the 
pericardium, the covering of the heart. And all

35:38.591 --> 35:45.980
kinds of organisms in the room go in there, and she 
has an inflammation, an infection in the

35:38.591 --> 35:45.980
pericardium. Traumatic. It was traumatic 
pericarditis.

35:54.649 --> 36:03.058
So a veterinarian is someone who is technically 
skilled in the factory. Yeah. At this day and time,

36:04.503 --> 36:08.968
he has to have the technology to compete. You can't 
do it without the techniques and the implements

36:08.988 --> 36:17.078
and the gadgetry that you've developed. To tell 
you the thing, one of the biggest things today is

36:17.098 --> 36:30.814
non-invasive techniques,

36:17.098 --> 36:30.814
sonar, OS, so that you can see what's inside 
without invading the body from the invasive. And

36:34.144 --> 36:36.687
that's a great problem. Because any time you 
invade the body, the flesh, you cause a potential

36:36.707 --> 36:47.563
problem of infection and this sort of thing. So you 
can see what's in there without doing that. You're

36:51.468 --> 36:52.650
way ahead of the game. So we're getting better and 
better and better with the technology, and it's

36:53.440 --> 37:01.529
going to get better and better, and the skills are 
going to be less and less. And when I say skills and

37:01.949 --> 37:06.875
arts, they're going to continue to subside. And 
I'm not saying that's wrong at all. So you've got to

37:10.679 --> 37:13.222
have the technology this day and time. It used to 
have to be the arts and the skills, and now the

37:13.242 --> 37:17.246
technology. Now the second thing the guy's got to 
have is public relations.

37:24.828 --> 37:27.351
He's got to like people. He's got to know people and 
relate to people. We have so many

37:31.935 --> 37:41.525
little girls coming. A girl, a woman, a young woman 
comes to get her medicine because they fell in love

37:41.545 --> 37:51.876
with

37:41.545 --> 37:51.876
a horse. But you've got to have more than that. Some 
of them will say, well, I just love animals. Shoot,

37:58.392 --> 38:01.597
you wouldn't want a veterinarian if you didn't 
love animals. But that's just the beginning of it.

38:04.822 --> 38:08.928
So that is an innate part of veterinary medicine is 
an affection, let's say, for animals. Oh, yeah.

38:09.749 --> 38:13.574
You have to have compassion for the welfare of the 
animal. But on the other hand, we can't overlook

38:13.655 --> 38:18.902
the needs of the client. You're working for a 
client, not for an animal.

38:25.882 --> 38:27.985
And you've got to face those two also. There are 
times when you can't do what you want to do. Well,

38:34.434 --> 38:36.697
for one reason, it's too expensive. And you know 
that you could make that animal better, maybe

38:37.959 --> 38:48.293
heal, if you could do what you really wanted to do. 
But you can't afford to do it because it would cost

38:49.555 --> 38:55.163
more than that animal is worth. you know, we don't 
have that problem. You do it. And insurance covers

38:59.990 --> 39:02.253
it or something. On that same line, I don't know if 
this is the right place to do it because we need to

39:02.273 --> 39:17.374
get back to the profile of a veterinarian, but as I 
see it too, one of the difficulties in promoting or

39:02.273 --> 39:17.374
advancing the practice of veterinary medicine 
has been the problem of cost. So, for example, In

39:19.949 --> 39:25.622
fact, I was raised with the idea that animals are 
basically expendable, that you don't spend money

39:19.949 --> 39:25.622
on them. I never spent a nickel on a pet. They were 
always free, and if they died, tough. You don't do

39:30.032 --> 39:31.095
that. I spent a lot. That's an old agrarian 
philosophy, though. That's right, but I spend a

39:33.781 --> 39:36.808
lot of money on my dogs now. Yeah, well, we've got to 
end the round, too, the human. animal barn today,

39:40.132 --> 39:41.954
you know. Yeah, and your high-priced equipment 
you're talking about is expensive stuff.

39:45.918 --> 39:46.399
Absolutely. So has part of the problem of 
veterinary medicine, you think, been convincing

39:46.419 --> 39:55.028
people that they need to invest in their animals? 
I'm not sure if I'm asking that question

39:55.048 --> 40:05.639
correctly, but that somehow or other, in other 
words, you can prove the efficiencies, the cost

39:55.048 --> 40:05.639
efficiencies of taking care of animals. Is that 
part of the of the message that veterinarians have

40:07.385 --> 40:11.491
had to get across in the Southwest? Well, you know, 
you can sort of classify people in two categories

40:11.511 --> 40:16.479
in that regard. Those who have compassion for and 
will go all out for their animal. And those who say,

40:23.029 --> 40:27.295
well, it's just a dog. And there's a vast 
difference in that. This one over here will pay the

40:29.478 --> 40:32.583
price. No way. Yeah. Now, you know, they meld 
together in here, and they're not two extremes,

40:36.207 --> 40:56.214
but nevertheless, you have to know, as a 
veterinarian, as a private clinic practitioner,

40:36.207 --> 40:56.214
they have to know that this individual wants this 
dog fixed, no matter the cost. This one over here,

40:56.995 --> 41:01.962
no, he just wants to know, should have killed him. 
And you've got all that in there, and you've got to

41:03.477 --> 41:09.104
weasel that out of the people of your clients. Your 
dog can't tell you that. And you don't know that, so

41:11.988 --> 41:15.512
you've got to get it from within. That's where the 
human relationship has to come in, to know what

41:15.552 --> 41:22.561
that client wants done. That's really an 
intriguing and key point. And if you please that

41:25.084 --> 41:30.211
client, you've got a regular client. If you 
displease that client, and going somewhere else.

41:33.681 --> 41:38.728
And that's the way you build your business, is 
people relationship, not animals. Has that

41:38.748 --> 41:39.970
changed over the years? I mean, when you were 
growing up in Erath County, I imagine all your

41:39.990 --> 41:48.261
neighbors were farmers, agriculturists. 
Animals were a means of production. They were

41:51.286 --> 41:51.887
pets. There wasn't necessarily a bond with the 
milk cows or with whatever, you know. Oh, Boston,

41:58.388 --> 42:00.931
that's pretty close to the family. All right, but 
you're... You know, but as people move to the city,

42:00.951 --> 42:09.403
as they have pets for whatever reasons, there's a 
completely different attitude. Oh, yeah. My

42:09.743 --> 42:10.544
wife's from a farm. I'm not. And, you know, we run 
into that all the time. Yeah. Because she's got one

42:16.873 --> 42:21.899
set of values about animals, and I've got a 
completely different set of values. And it's

42:21.919 --> 42:24.022
difficult to find ground in there. Yeah, you 
know... There are great extremes in this animal

42:26.148 --> 42:29.953
side. There's the animal rights activist, 
militant. I mean, crazy on that side. And then

42:40.546 --> 42:50.519
there are those who are just like barbarians to 
animals.

42:50.539 --> 42:53.202
In here, there's a better mix, I think. We need to be 
as humane as we can be with animals. I don't think

43:00.625 --> 43:02.708
animals have any rights. You talk about animal 
rights. They don't have any rights. But we as

43:08.036 --> 43:22.076
people ought to be,

43:08.036 --> 43:22.076
well, compassionate enough to treat that animal 
without being a barbarian. We need to treat that

43:22.096 --> 43:24.640
animal carefully. and correctly. We don't want to 
cause that pain. And we need to be as humanitarian

43:33.830 --> 43:38.796
as we can possibly be as veterinarians. Well, 
everybody should be trained, not just

43:38.816 --> 43:44.723
veterinarians.

43:47.306 --> 43:55.015
And if you do that,

43:47.306 --> 43:55.015
you satisfy the activists. And some of the others 
over on this other side say, well, that's stupid.

43:59.577 --> 44:03.261
You're just wasting your money. But let me come 
back to it. Veterinarians ought to be standing for

44:06.404 --> 44:23.061
humanitarian

44:06.404 --> 44:23.061
care for the animals under their control or their 
owners, being the owners of what? So we need to do

44:25.673 --> 44:39.792
everything that we can to give that animal a 
comfortable bath time.

44:39.812 --> 44:43.437
Now, money comes into the picture, no question 
about that. And as I said a while ago, sometimes you

44:43.457 --> 44:50.727
can't do that because the owner won't let you do 
that, won't pay the bill. Well, if you go doing that

44:50.747 --> 44:55.073
for people who don't pay the bill, Your business is 
going to fall apart. And you've got to work those

44:58.113 --> 45:00.797
together. But humanitarianism is a very 
essential part of the life of a veterinarian. Yes.

45:08.107 --> 45:12.473
If you dislike animals, you ought not be there. And 
that's one of the things that they, in the

45:12.493 --> 45:19.863
admissions committee, will query the person 
about humanitarianism. How do they feel about

45:20.765 --> 45:23.789
these things? And now... On the other hand, the 
other extreme, that the animal has every right,

45:25.360 --> 45:44.441
and you can't use an animal in any form or shape for 
research, you're violating their rights, well,

45:25.360 --> 45:44.441
let it be so. My perception is that animals are here 
for a man, and people use the animals, not the

45:55.820 --> 45:59.304
animals using people. But the people should use 
the animal correctly, humanitarily, and then go

45:59.325 --> 46:09.778
on from there.

46:09.798 --> 46:19.030
So I think, yes, the American has to have a 
compassion and a love for animals. Is that taught

46:19.050 --> 46:22.675
in school, an ethical posture? Oh, yeah. We have no 
course in ethics, but we try to put ethics threaded

46:24.119 --> 46:34.729
through all

46:24.119 --> 46:34.729
of it. And we have differences of opinion among our 
students. We have students that don't want to

46:39.514 --> 46:46.121
dissect a dog, and the dog's been destroyed, 
killed. He's been anesthetized, and then

46:47.882 --> 46:53.468
euthanized, painless.

46:57.582 --> 47:00.094
to learn what he's made of. You've got to look at 
what he's made of. And they said, well, do it with

47:03.791 --> 47:06.242
slack.
