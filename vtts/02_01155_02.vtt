WEBVTT

00:01.360 --> 00:17.930
anytime we just talk about it because it's you've

00:01.360 --> 00:17.930
got

00:01.360 --> 00:17.930
well let me go get that tape I didn't realize that 
okay Charles Schultz or Dave Chapman one thing you

00:30.520 --> 00:40.400
mentioned there about practice there is a effort

00:30.520 --> 00:40.400
at least to say that every veterinarian

00:40.380 --> 01:03.750
practice that's

00:40.380 --> 01:03.750
a good because I was defining practice as being in 
the business yeah that's

01:03.730 --> 01:16.650
a good point that will help me relieve some of the 
tensions I see between the two areas so we're all

01:16.630 --> 01:23.890
the same all seeking to do the same thing and that is 
the end result is a service to the that they can't do

01:23.870 --> 01:33.110
them so

01:33.090 --> 01:39.010
we get you can are you a

01:39.230 --> 03:17.430
Texan

01:39.230 --> 03:17.430
when

01:39.230 --> 03:17.430
did

01:39.230 --> 03:17.430
he get

01:39.230 --> 03:17.430
into that reason

01:39.230 --> 03:17.430
I asked

01:39.230 --> 03:17.430
I

01:39.230 --> 03:17.430
have

01:39.230 --> 03:17.430
an

01:39.230 --> 03:17.430
uncle

03:17.410 --> 03:27.160
in Louisiana but he was in the purebred

03:17.410 --> 03:27.160
it was partly even in the 40s or so 30s I guess when he 
got into it it was a novel

03:27.140 --> 03:55.420
he never would

03:27.140 --> 03:55.420
wonder if he had that you know we had an expression 
in Louisiana gone to Texas it meant something

03:55.400 --> 04:25.310
anyway

03:55.400 --> 04:25.310
did pretty

04:25.290 --> 05:08.060
well but he came to Texas and Benton County and he 
went to

04:25.290 --> 05:08.060
work

04:25.290 --> 05:08.060
inside Maimقط

04:25.290 --> 05:08.060
and was born in Comfort I've

05:08.040 --> 05:49.660
been

05:08.040 --> 05:49.660
grown

05:08.040 --> 05:49.660
up there in New Red County in

05:08.040 --> 05:49.660
Sandinland you know

05:08.040 --> 05:49.660
what what year was that that is 1935

05:49.640 --> 06:13.730
from there in there I worked in the Alamo Refinery 
later

05:49.640 --> 06:13.730
change to Philisp Wiree I there and I was in with 
thentexasx collection as theぐて some guys that

06:19.630 --> 06:21.271
were 30 years old. I was 17 years old right off the 
farm green.

06:27.377 --> 06:36.104
Those guys had been working and they knew how to 
play all night from the phone, you know, all that

06:27.377 --> 06:36.104
stuff.

06:37.946 --> 06:44.191
They treated me like I was their son, I guess. You 
know, they were giving me the shirt off their back,

06:45.012 --> 06:52.779
but they were vile and they were vulgar and their 
language was terrible. Always kidding with me,

06:52.839 --> 07:05.810
you know, and sending me over to get something that 
didn't,

06:52.839 --> 07:05.810
well, there's got to be something better. I had to 
have a job where

07:05.790 --> 07:20.154
I couldn't go. So I got a job, swooping sidewalks.

07:34.658 --> 07:40.960
And that night I thought, well, I'm going back 
home. And then I went to the oil fence there.

07:53.363 --> 08:21.591
Well, when I came back

07:53.363 --> 08:21.591
home

07:53.363 --> 08:21.591
that time, then I went to San Diego

07:53.363 --> 08:21.591
Farm.

08:23.032 --> 08:26.893
We borrowed

08:23.032 --> 08:26.893
$25. That $25, and I went to the park. Then we had the 
new $25

08:33.554 --> 09:05.343
is what I had to

08:33.554 --> 09:05.343
have to pay

08:33.554 --> 09:05.343
down.

09:05.423 --> 09:26.809
And I could pay the

09:05.423 --> 09:26.809
rest

09:05.423 --> 09:26.809
of it for a period

09:05.423 --> 09:26.809
of time. So I had to have a job again. A guy came along 
that was a a I guess you'd call it the garbage. He

09:36.923 --> 09:41.510
came up with garbage and had it. So he gave me a job. 
And that's what I did, was go around and pick up that

09:44.335 --> 09:50.164
garbage. That

09:51.726 --> 10:00.940
way I was able to make enough and make it through 
Tarleton. Finished Tarleton in a couple of years.

10:02.983 --> 10:05.586
It was a junior college then. And then I went to come 
to Texas. I paid all my debts there, but I didn't

10:10.171 --> 10:25.310
have enough money.

10:25.290 --> 10:30.523
I did it today, just Stephenville, Texas, and put a 
ride down on a flatbed truck. I sat back there and

10:31.605 --> 10:40.747
the wind was blowing and I was nearly blowing all of 
that with the wheat. We came down, he dropped it,

10:40.767 --> 10:41.870
stopped. at the East Gate over there and I got off 
with my luggage and I started walking up a little

10:41.850 --> 10:51.002
big old pillar. An old country boy like me can't do 
this. I turned around and I started back down to

10:56.689 --> 11:03.618
Texas Avenue, what is now Texas Avenue, to get your 
ride back home. I can't do that. Then I said to

11:05.500 --> 11:14.208
myself, you're an idiot. You're an idiot. Just a 
plain idiot. So I turned around and went on back up

11:27.739 --> 11:39.650
there. Well, fortunately, at Tarleton, there was 
a bunch of, I guess he is really the... The source.

11:53.398 --> 11:54.630
The source of... Because usually there is someone 
like that. I was going to ask you if you've been a

11:55.597 --> 12:00.630
county agent or a vocational ag teacher or what, 
but it was this guy. Yeah, Vern. He knew Dr. C.N.

12:06.813 --> 12:08.414
Shepards. He and Vern Scott had Dairy Science,

12:08.954 --> 13:00.980
so the second

12:08.954 --> 13:00.980
dean.

13:00.960 --> 13:01.981
Marsteller, wasn't it? Marsteller. Marsteller. 
Marsteller. Yeah, Marsteller. My wife... Yeah,

13:05.600 --> 13:07.171
me too. I went blank. Marsteller. It was getting a 
little

13:10.201 --> 14:17.580
late in the

13:10.201 --> 14:17.580
summer

13:10.201 --> 14:17.580
and I was

13:10.201 --> 14:17.580
an

13:10.201 --> 14:17.580
old Dairy

13:10.201 --> 14:17.580
Science

13:10.201 --> 14:17.580
major.

14:17.560 --> 14:24.548
I wanted to study Veterinary Medicine, but 
without a job, well, maybe I'd better go the other

14:17.560 --> 14:24.548
way. At least I'd be in college, so I went over. I 
told him, well, I'll take it. And so he did. I had

14:30.203 --> 15:03.700
every

14:30.203 --> 15:03.700
intention of this

14:30.203 --> 15:03.700
degree and trying to save enough money to come back 
to Veterinary.

15:03.720 --> 15:04.060
So... So, what kind of job opportunities were 
there then for V.S. in Animal Science? Pretty

15:09.250 --> 15:09.692
good? In the 40s and 80s? Yeah, I think so. I got a

15:14.024 --> 15:38.600
job

15:14.024 --> 15:38.600
in Dairy Science, however.

15:38.580 --> 15:39.601
That's all right. Yeah.

15:44.974 --> 15:54.740
So, what kind of job opportunities did you have? 
Well, I got a job in Rock and Dairy Farm.

16:04.590 --> 16:06.792
We had 600 cows. In a way, I went down there and

16:07.733 --> 16:34.380
didn't get back in that three year span that I had 
intended. But, in the meantime, four years there,

16:34.360 --> 16:49.650
and in the meantime had married, and by the time I 
got back to the States, I'd saved enough money

16:34.360 --> 16:49.650
to... So, in 1946,

16:49.630 --> 17:00.490
then, I came back to study Veterinary and 
graduated in 1945. And you were also in G.I. Bill?

17:01.470 --> 17:02.074
Yeah. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, sure. Ray's my 
cousin. Is that right? Yeah, yeah. ...and came

17:08.286 --> 17:09.490
back over here. You bet. That's interesting. You 
bet. So, you came back in 46 and then finished your

17:12.041 --> 17:13.490
degree in 49. Came back in, yeah. Was the... Yeah, 
yeah. Was the... Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

17:23.320 --> 17:24.626
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Was the 
demand for...was it tough to get into the school at

17:32.771 --> 17:36.380
that time? Do you remember? I don't... In terms of 
numbers or... Is it...?

17:46.654 --> 17:47.660
Yeah. Is it... That's all I'm...

18:04.270 --> 18:05.291
I think it was a salient impensity. That sounds

18:05.270 --> 18:21.930
about

18:05.270 --> 18:21.930
right. It seemed like I've seen that number, that 
kind of number, as well, too. At that time, what did

18:31.160 --> 18:36.200
most of the students, the veterinary students, 
anticipate going into upon graduation? Private

18:37.280 --> 18:38.481
clinical practice. Into private clinical 
practice? clinical practice in the country,

18:39.460 --> 18:44.480
rural settings, cattle business, large animals. 
Okay, I'm going to follow that. I'll figure

18:49.411 --> 19:01.920
it out and be thought. I

19:01.900 --> 19:09.413
guess it was that really... So when you got your 
degree,

19:09.473 --> 19:24.620
what happened

19:09.473 --> 19:24.620
to you then? You didn't go into private practice? 
No.

19:39.100 --> 19:46.670
Yeah.

19:53.158 --> 20:01.950
Anyway, there's a little,

19:53.158 --> 20:01.950
pretty good dairy shed. Well, I had a Dairy Science 
B.S. degree, and going to little

20:05.398 --> 20:19.670
places like that, you couldn't... You had to be 
somewhat of a generalist. Yeah. Nobody else there

20:25.820 --> 20:30.291
to concentrate on dairy cattle. Well, long in... 
When

20:31.600 --> 21:02.540
I

20:31.600 --> 21:02.540
came back here,

20:31.600 --> 21:02.540
the

20:31.600 --> 21:02.540
job was an instructor in their physiology.

21:02.520 --> 21:08.620
So I'd had army experience and soldiers,

21:08.600 --> 21:17.790
and then the little experience there in the 
Department of Medicine, and then I was about to

21:17.770 --> 21:25.740
graduate with the Dr. John Miller, who was head

21:25.720 --> 21:32.960
of the Department of the Histology Laboratory to 
my side, and said, Pryor, have

21:39.120 --> 21:52.500
you ever been to Clifton? Clifton, Texas. Going to 
Clifton, Texas, and Pryor said, Well,

22:00.420 --> 22:05.576
why don't you think about it? And that's all he 
said. All of a sudden, he went by and he asked me

22:06.220 --> 22:09.240
again. I

22:09.220 --> 22:17.610
don't know. He

22:17.590 --> 22:22.236
continued the whole time. He didn't argue with me 
or anything. What... He came back the third time,

22:23.805 --> 22:27.710
and I thought, well, he was wrong. Maybe he was 
telling me something. And finally, he said on that

22:31.290 --> 22:36.290
third time, he said, I've got a job for

22:36.270 --> 22:40.790
you. I said, well, let me think about it, and

22:43.040 --> 22:47.150
I told him I might, but I'll be back in a week. Then I 
thought about it, and I thought, well, you know,

22:47.130 --> 22:51.840
I'm going to do it for a week. And then I can still go 
to Clifton for the market. So I came back and told

22:57.380 --> 23:02.080
him, okay. He said, well, that's fine. Then you've 
got the job. So I graduated, and the

23:05.660 --> 23:19.280
sun was out, and I had a book. He says, you're going 
to teach this,

23:19.260 --> 23:24.570
an old poem. Sissons? What was the book? Sissons. 
Sissons? Yeah. Yeah, I remember that title.

23:31.530 --> 23:33.570
That's why I was asking. I've got the old reason. 
Sissons.

23:40.926 --> 23:42.892
S-I-S-S-O-N. It's Sisson and Grossman. I 
remember some of those old titles. Sissons

23:47.540 --> 24:06.120
and

23:47.540 --> 24:06.120
Grossman. That's something else I'd kind of like 
to ask you about, is the textbook and teaching side

24:08.100 --> 24:13.680
of it sometimes. Well, he handed me that book and

24:13.660 --> 24:29.680
all

24:13.660 --> 24:29.680
the instructions I had. And

24:29.660 --> 24:42.520
obviously you enjoyed it. What would have been 
the, what was your salary, starting salary? Do you

24:45.500 --> 25:00.810
remember

24:45.500 --> 25:00.810
my starting

24:45.500 --> 25:00.810
salary? Now, how, what would have been your, what 
would have been the situation had you gone into

25:04.790 --> 25:07.810
practice in Clifton? Well, of course, Clifton no 
longer is a dairy store, so something else would

25:12.220 --> 25:14.240
have had to happen. Yeah. What kind of an income or 
living would you have made had you gone into

25:21.420 --> 25:24.440
practice in Clifton at that time? I'd had to starve 
for about three years. Yeah. That was a pretty

25:27.277 --> 25:28.440
standard procedure. It would be tough to get into 
the business. Now, when a practitioner like that

25:30.420 --> 25:33.880
went out into business on their own, basically you 
hang a shingle up and you're on your own, is it a

25:37.940 --> 25:44.380
matter of public relations, a matter of someone 
being available? What makes it work or not work?

25:46.360 --> 25:57.720
People have to want to come to you.

25:57.700 --> 26:14.880
Sometimes

25:57.700 --> 26:14.880
you've got to do

25:57.700 --> 26:14.880
some things that

25:57.700 --> 26:14.880
you... Veterinarian

26:14.860 --> 26:23.880
went out into practice then and now, I guess. This 
is a broad thing I've been kind of interested in.

26:28.050 --> 26:32.070
Was there or is there any business training for 
that veterinarian? Main

26:32.050 --> 26:56.140
thing that I've heard through society.

26:56.120 --> 26:58.320
Yeah.

26:59.430 --> 27:00.600
I'm wondering about that because, you know, just 
in the TVMA meeting the other day, it came

27:00.580 --> 27:05.780
immediately. I mean, I know there are technicians 
too. Yeah. But they're running businesses, and

27:13.233 --> 27:15.670
those businesses, some of them apparently were 
big operations. I know I was talking to Pinky in El

27:18.650 --> 27:24.080
Paso. Sorry, but anyway. And I gathered he's 
operating as a businessman.

27:35.860 --> 27:38.540
You're running a business. So that was just one 
aspect of it. Technology

27:39.520 --> 27:51.440
in there is just not time to make a businessman. Of 
course, medical doctors have the same situation.

27:53.420 --> 27:54.461
Yeah. That's correct. Now, they will learn it. The 
hard way. If you give them the business without the

27:58.420 --> 28:01.940
technology, they can't learn. And then they will 
learn

28:02.920 --> 28:16.510
on their own later. Yeah. The business, it will 
finally learn. When

28:19.490 --> 28:31.630
they go out of here, now or in 1949, did you have any 
idea what kind of charges you should make for

28:31.610 --> 28:34.630
services and anything like that? Yeah, we talked 
about that a little bit. You had something to do

28:38.950 --> 28:40.970
with it. We also had the practitioners. Yeah, 
sure. Little idea.

29:10.090 --> 29:15.840
On the other hand, even then, and I guess even more 
after that, you go out

29:15.820 --> 29:59.110
there and make a

29:15.820 --> 29:59.110
blunder

29:15.820 --> 29:59.110
in

29:15.820 --> 29:59.110
his

29:15.820 --> 29:59.110
practice already rooted. And they'll come back to 
him. So you learn from him, stakes at his expense

30:00.090 --> 30:08.330
rather than your own. Would you say that 
apprenticeship is more common now than it was? Do

30:12.310 --> 30:18.490
most of your students now going out of here 
actually go into some sort of apprenticeship

30:18.470 --> 30:21.490
situation? I guess, if nothing else, having the 
capital to go into business. So, I know

30:24.620 --> 30:32.200
a lot of them. A lot of our analog years have known a 
lot. Many of them

30:36.350 --> 30:44.970
get into veterinary medicine because they like 
animals. Yet, one of the things you're telling me

30:44.950 --> 30:48.970
is that maybe the most important thing is that they 
like people. If they don't like people, they

30:48.950 --> 30:54.230
wouldn't like to eat people. Yeah, sure. Do you 
screen or in the interview process that you go

30:54.897 --> 30:58.230
through, do you try, I mean, for their own good 
always? Has that always happened? Did that happen

31:04.640 --> 31:06.680
in 1949? Well, I don't know of 1949. I wasn't on the 
admission. Yeah. I don't know. We've tried

31:15.780 --> 31:20.160
through the years. It's hard to do. And it's 
subjective as it can be. But, yeah, they make an

31:25.140 --> 31:28.320
effort to. That's a good question. How would you 
describe or profile a typical veterinarian or a

31:29.300 --> 31:35.320
student or someone that you think should be in that 
kind of business? Do you have an image of a

31:39.350 --> 31:41.370
veterinarian? An

31:41.350 --> 31:46.560
image of what a veterinarian ought to be? What is 
that? Yes.

31:50.882 --> 31:53.560
And my image may be false. I'm sure. It may be false. 
Number one, he's got to be

31:57.140 --> 32:48.320
skilled.

32:48.300 --> 32:54.120
Visual capability, perceiving what that was. A 
skill, that's a lesson.

33:00.060 --> 33:17.080
Today, we have,

33:00.060 --> 33:17.080
but we are losers.

33:17.060 --> 33:19.080
So it's more technology oriented than. Well, we 
didn't have the technology. So we had to do.

33:34.650 --> 33:50.319
Intuition

33:34.650 --> 33:50.319
to say traumatic

33:34.650 --> 33:50.319
. . .

34:34.060 --> 34:38.440
Well,

34:34.060 --> 34:38.440
sure enough, she did. You know, certain signs that 
he had seen so many times, he knew what they was. He

34:52.950 --> 34:53.887
didn't have to go . . . Now, that is skill, but it's 
also art. Literally,

34:57.170 --> 35:42.760
that's

34:57.170 --> 35:42.760
what's

34:57.170 --> 35:42.760
happening.

35:42.740 --> 35:47.180
And inflammation and infection.

35:47.160 --> 35:48.181
It was traumatic. So they need

35:48.160 --> 35:57.578
. . . A veterinarian is someone who is technically 
skilled in the factory. Yeah. This day and time, he

36:04.563 --> 36:22.260
has to have the

36:04.563 --> 36:22.260
tech. Non-invasive tech.

36:29.210 --> 36:31.560
You can see what's inside without invading the 
body. You can

36:31.540 --> 36:48.430
see what's

36:31.540 --> 36:48.430
in there. I'm not

36:48.410 --> 37:07.860
saying that's wrong.

37:07.840 --> 37:11.580
So you've got to have the technology. This day and 
time. I just love animals.

37:57.100 --> 38:06.610
So that is an innate part of veterinary

37:57.100 --> 38:06.610
medicine. It is an affection, let's say, for 
animals. Oh, yeah.

38:12.966 --> 38:16.780
On the other hand, we can't overlook. Working for a 
client, not for . . . And you've got to face

38:21.460 --> 38:26.740
those two off. There are times when you can't do 
what you wanted. And you know that you could make

38:31.910 --> 38:39.077
that . . . And do what you really wanted to do. But you 
can't afford to do it. Because it would cost more

38:49.540 --> 38:52.560
than that animal is worth. And insurance

38:52.540 --> 39:00.730
covers it or something. On that same line, I don't 
know if this is the right place to do it. Because we

39:03.710 --> 39:06.730
need to get back to the profile of a veterinarian. 
But

39:06.710 --> 39:16.850
as I see it, too, one of the difficulties in 
promoting or advancing the practice of

39:06.710 --> 39:16.850
veterinary medicine has been the problem of cost. 
So, for example, in fact, I was raised with the idea

39:16.830 --> 39:23.320
that animals are basically expendable. That you 
don't spend money on them. I never spent a nickel on

39:25.460 --> 39:26.481
a pet. They were always free and if they died, 
tough. You don't do that. I spend a lot. That's an

39:31.460 --> 39:33.480
old agrarian philosophy, though. That's right. 
But I spend a lot of money on my dogs now. Yeah. And so

39:36.133 --> 39:37.072
. . . Yeah. And your high-priced equipment you're 
talking about is expensive stuff. Absolutely.

39:46.345 --> 39:54.330
So, has part of the problem of veterinary 
medicine, you think, been convincing people that

39:46.345 --> 39:54.330
they need to invest in their animals? I'm not sure 
if I'm asking that question correctly. That

39:56.310 --> 40:05.480
somehow or other, in other words, you can prove the 
efficiencies, the cost efficiencies of taking

39:56.310 --> 40:05.480
care of animals. Is that part of the message that 
veterinarians have had to get across in the

40:05.460 --> 40:10.920
Southwest? Well, you know . . . Sure. You've got

40:12.841 --> 41:08.520
to weasel

40:12.841 --> 41:08.520
that out of

40:12.841 --> 41:08.520
the people

40:12.841 --> 41:08.520
of

40:12.841 --> 41:08.520
your planet.

41:08.500 --> 41:09.068
Yeah. Your dog can't take it. And

41:10.530 --> 41:14.974
that's where the . . . You're going

41:16.000 --> 41:32.500
somewhere

41:16.000 --> 41:32.500
else. Right. And that's the way you build your 
business. Has that changed over the . . . . . . were a

41:40.906 --> 41:50.800
means of production?

41:50.780 --> 41:53.536
There wasn't necessarily a . . . But as people move 
to the city, as they have pets for whatever

41:53.820 --> 42:07.480
reasons, there's a completely different . . . . . . 
because she's got

42:07.861 --> 42:17.810
one set of values. There

42:17.790 --> 42:31.000
are great extremes in this animal rights tactic. 
And

42:30.980 --> 42:49.570
then there are those who need to be as human . . .

42:55.540 --> 42:55.620
. . . humanitarian

42:55.780 --> 43:37.200
as

42:55.780 --> 43:37.200
we can

42:55.780 --> 43:37.200
possibly be. And if you do that, you satisfy

43:37.180 --> 43:48.388
the .

43:52.819 --> 43:52.979
. . . . . and some of the others over on this other side 
say, well, that's stupid. Veterinarians

43:59.660 --> 44:10.390
ought to be standing for humanitarian . . . . . . 
humanitarian, I guess, humanitarian,

44:11.896 --> 44:19.990
under their control or . . . . . .

44:25.780 --> 44:42.150
so we need to do everything that we can to give that 
animal money

44:25.780 --> 44:42.150
comes into the picture. No question about that. 
But sometimes you can't. You don't pay the bill.

44:50.420 --> 44:56.950
Well, if you don't, your business is going to fail. 
And you've got to . . . But

44:58.820 --> 45:05.290
humanitarianism is a very essential part. If you 
dislike animals, you ought not be there. There's

45:10.570 --> 45:25.584
an extreme

45:10.570 --> 45:25.584
that the .

45:25.604 --> 45:25.705
. . . . .

45:31.814 --> 45:34.437
humanitarian . . .

46:03.630 --> 46:05.011
. . .
