WEBVTT

00:02.140 --> 00:22.246
Well,

00:02.140 --> 00:22.246
some of the older Army types were skeptical,

00:02.140 --> 00:22.246
but I think they all recognized the right thing to 
do and the right move.

00:22.266 --> 00:24.569
Of course, they would have rather had it under 
their command. Sure. And they now have their own

00:25.430 --> 00:29.756
Air Corps again. Sure. But

00:31.047 --> 00:46.041
there wasn't, you and an instructor at West Point, 
there wasn't any tension? No, because we're

00:46.061 --> 00:50.986
getting graduates from West Point who are going 
into the Air Corps every year. Sure. And from the

00:51.566 --> 00:56.932
Naval Academy as well at that time until we 
established the Air Corps together. Sure. All

00:59.534 --> 01:00.615
right. You were on again and off again at West 
Point. You were there from May of 46 to September of

01:05.132 --> 01:08.176
47. Well, what I did was I went to Springfield 
College and got my master's degree in physical

01:08.736 --> 01:13.402
education. Oh, okay. That's just what I thought. 
You were there at Springfield College from

01:16.705 --> 01:22.152
September of 47 to June of 48, basically. Yeah. I 
just got my master's degree. And why did you pick

01:26.436 --> 01:29.640
Springfield College?

01:33.232 --> 02:02.850
my predecessor had gone there and it was 
recognized at that time it was recognized as the

01:33.232 --> 02:02.850
best physical education school in the United 
States and it's I don't know that it is still it's

01:33.232 --> 02:02.850
the old YMCA what it is the YMCA college

01:33.232 --> 02:02.850
it's had a physical education program that

02:06.509 --> 02:25.353
outstanding program for years and most of the 
leaders in the physical education field have been

02:06.509 --> 02:25.353
graduates or have attended and gotten their

02:06.509 --> 02:25.353
graduate degrees from there. How did you like it 
there?

02:29.117 --> 02:30.980
I enjoyed it. It was very difficult because I had 
carried a heavy, heavy load of subjects. My wife

02:39.099 --> 02:42.004
was pregnant. We had one small child. We rented an 
apartment and had stoked the furnace. I'd get up at

02:52.259 --> 03:00.732
5 o'clock in the morning and stoke the furnace and 
feed them both breakfast because she couldn't

02:52.259 --> 03:00.732
stand the smell of cooking. And then I'd come home. 
She had morning sickness? No, the smell of cooking

03:05.022 --> 03:07.386
made her sick. Oh.

03:11.771 --> 03:14.855
She was miserable, I think. And I would leave and go 
to school and be there all day and get home about 6.

03:22.285 --> 03:29.655
And then feed them dinner and study until about 12 
o'clock and stoke the furnace.

03:32.639 --> 03:33.781
It was like a long grind. It was, but I enjoyed

03:33.902 --> 03:38.270
it. And you received your master's. Well, I didn't 
receive it then. I finished the courses. I had to

03:43.000 --> 03:46.607
write a thesis.

03:46.627 --> 03:50.395
After I wrote the thesis, I didn't get it until it 
was done, until it was 51.

03:59.369 --> 04:05.958
And had anything changed, or did you basically 
continue for the next two years to teach the same

03:59.369 --> 04:05.958
courses?

04:10.545 --> 04:24.685
Well, the first year, I had been in charge of, I had 
been the S4 for the office, which was in charge of

04:10.545 --> 04:24.685
Office 5, and in charge of the gymnasiums, all the 
facilities, and the cleaning up, and all that. In

04:25.340 --> 04:30.025
the last two years, I was the operations officer. I 
did all the scheduling,

04:30.045 --> 04:35.711
looked up all the schedules. So it was a different 
job, although

04:35.731 --> 04:46.563
I didn't change anything when I was teaching. You 
left West Point in July of 1950, and for six months

04:46.583 --> 04:51.588
you were a student at Maxwell Air Force Base. Yeah, 
the Air Command Staff College. Tell me about that.

04:56.729 --> 05:05.441
That's the intermediate level of the Air Force of 
the Air University, the Air Force Educational

04:56.729 --> 05:05.441
System. And that's to teach

05:05.461 --> 05:24.186
staff level

05:05.461 --> 05:24.186
people to do staff level duties and to broaden 
their aspects of it and look at the Air Force from a

05:24.757 --> 05:38.445
different viewpoint and whatever they're using 
narrowly then like you've done a fighter pilot all

05:24.757 --> 05:38.445
the time just to spread you across so you can look at 
the full perspective and look at all the look at

05:38.915 --> 05:50.437
what the material officer does, what the office 
officer does, what the personnel officer does,

05:38.915 --> 05:50.437
what they all do, and prepare them for high-level 
staff and command duty. So this was exactly what it

05:51.659 --> 05:52.922
was for. How good was it? It was excellent. Very 
good. Was it primarily based on the Army command

05:57.210 --> 06:00.957
and general staff? I don't know what the Army 
Command and General Staff had. It was developed by

06:05.085 --> 06:10.673
the Air University. And your instructors were 
mostly colonels?

06:19.144 --> 06:22.388
I wouldn't say that they were mostly colonels. 
Mostly lieutenant colonels and colonels.

06:29.776 --> 06:32.059
How was the quality of instruction? The quality 
was outstanding.

06:36.806 --> 06:38.168
Very well done. They've done a good job forming the 
Air University and getting it stocked with good

06:38.188 --> 06:45.618
people. And why then after your completion in 
December 1950 did you become the Assistant

06:45.638 --> 06:53.209
Secretary and then the Secretary of the Air 
University? Well... For the next three years?

06:56.333 --> 06:57.995
Almost. It picked me off. Well,

07:00.134 --> 07:09.806
a guy that had known me was a secretary. I had 
nothing. Every major command, there's a shot at

07:11.348 --> 07:15.052
whoever was a graduate there. They have a shot at 
selecting who they want. I guess they had enough.

07:20.299 --> 07:24.744
They selected

07:20.299 --> 07:24.744
me. Put me in there. Well, why you? Were you an 
outstanding student? Well, I

07:31.625 --> 07:41.901
was a good student, yes, but I don't know why me any 
more than anybody else. They looked at my record to

07:41.962 --> 07:47.350
see where I'd been and what I'd done, I suppose. 
They also gave you a promotion to Lieutenant

07:47.370 --> 07:50.836
Colonel at the time, in 1950. Well, that promotion 
probably came from my performance of the military

07:55.028 --> 08:01.536
community,

07:55.028 --> 08:01.536
probably. A lot of people during this time were not 
being promoted at all, because of the United

08:01.556 --> 08:15.653
States, well from 45 to 50 we were decreasing, and 
you get an appointment

08:28.863 --> 08:42.621
I think

08:28.863 --> 08:42.621
it was

08:28.863 --> 08:42.621
more than a record. It probably had to do with the 
record

08:43.101 --> 08:57.980
and the particular age group or group of people 
that I was with in the rank

08:43.101 --> 08:57.980
of major. I've been a major since 44. This was 
temporary promotion. I guess I was in the eligible

09:04.209 --> 09:06.993
group and got selected. Were you eager to go to 
France? I sure was. I volunteered for it. I wrote a

09:12.983 --> 09:14.665
letter. I knew the director of personnel, officer 
personnel in Pentagon. I wrote a letter

09:20.174 --> 09:21.396
volunteering. And that's the way I got to go. And 
what did he... Well, you didn't go until September

09:28.448 --> 09:30.350
of 1953. Well, I had to be jet qualified, and then I 
had to check out in the airplanes. Okay. Well,

09:37.018 --> 09:49.472
before we talk about jet qualifying, which, of 
course, in April of 1953, you get the jet course,

09:37.018 --> 09:49.472
tell me what you did as the assistant secretary and 
secretary of the Air University. What does it

09:49.492 --> 09:50.293
mean? What were your duties? I had charge of all the 
records of all the students in the Air University.

09:55.921 --> 09:57.262
So you're like a registrar. Yeah, like a 
registrar. And I worked for the Director of

09:58.744 --> 10:02.567
Education. And I wrote all his letters and 
composed them. And I wrote all the letters to all

10:09.213 --> 10:20.484
the guest speakers for the Air War College, Air 
Command Staff College, where they were getting

10:09.213 --> 10:20.484
the guest speakers. And I provided for their 
billeting, their transportation, and we met

10:20.504 --> 10:23.987
them. It

10:25.891 --> 10:35.403
sounds pretty much like a fighter pilot at a desk 
job. It sure was. What did you think of it? I wasn't

10:38.808 --> 10:40.129
very happy. Well, I enjoyed it all right, but I'd 
rather be in a flying organization. I figured I'd

10:49.481 --> 10:52.746
learn something. What did you learn? I

10:55.895 --> 11:22.283
learned a

10:55.895 --> 11:22.283
lot about the Air Force by George Kenny, the 
commander. I wrote letters for his signature. He

11:23.003 --> 11:23.724
told me a lot of his experiences. I had another guy 
named Barker, who was the vice commander. I

11:24.945 --> 11:25.446
learned a lot from him. about

11:26.303 --> 11:46.078
Hannon people. And my boss, of course, director of 
education, third down in command. Non-rated

11:47.500 --> 11:47.861
officer. He was a very brilliant man. Very 
articulate. Inspiring.

11:53.320 --> 11:58.086
You must have had a lot of very important guests 
come to your university and talk. I had to run the

12:00.149 --> 12:02.452
Board of Visitors, too. It's a very prestigious 
group. We have Notre Dame. We have MIT. We have

12:11.764 --> 12:15.469
Georgia Tech. You name

12:15.489 --> 12:19.293
it. One time or another, they come down and 
evaluate the whole education system. Which is one

12:23.982 --> 12:27.306
reason why I think it's so good. Because it has had 
top level attention. I mean top range in the

12:31.371 --> 12:37.198
country in terms of education. So it was a good 
blend. I mean you got a lot of advice and gave advice

12:39.161 --> 12:42.825
too to civilians. Yes. Nice. Did you have a good 
working relationship? Beautiful working

12:45.489 --> 12:47.351
relationship. With the civilians? With the 
civilians. It was outstanding.

12:52.433 --> 12:57.317
They were real, they were enthusiastic about it. 
And it helped a lot too. In what way?

12:59.519 --> 13:00.240
Recommendations. Sure. On improved quality of 
education. How to improve the quality of the

13:05.244 --> 13:08.767
education. So it doesn't seem to me that there was 
any tension between the military officers

13:08.787 --> 13:18.816
running their educational institution and the 
university civilians. No. Very cooperative. As a

13:22.218 --> 13:33.014
matter of fact, one of the schools at the Arizona 
University has a degree granting

13:22.218 --> 13:33.014
authorization. Which one? The Air Force 
Institute of Technology at Black Patterson. They

13:39.904 --> 13:48.437
give degrees in engineering,

13:39.904 --> 13:48.437
aeronautical engineering, and graduate 
degrees, too. Fantastic. That really is. Were you

13:52.306 --> 13:56.592
happy to get to that jet course in April of 1953? I 
was elated. That's what I had worked for.

14:04.482 --> 14:06.405
I volunteered for them. Okay, now tell me about 
this from April of 1953 to August of 1953. What type

14:12.994 --> 14:15.177
of jets were you using? FASXs? Well, I checked out. 
I did a qualification course in the T-33 at Craig

14:17.872 --> 14:26.224
Air Force Base. I was part of the training command 
at that time. Then I went to Nellis Air Force Base

14:29.529 --> 14:45.853
and started out by qualifying in the F-80 and 
diabolomic strafing

14:29.529 --> 14:45.853
and combat tactics and so forth. And then went into

14:47.217 --> 14:53.465
the F-86. Qualified in the F-86. Theoretically 
went over there to be in an F-86 organization. But

15:00.094 --> 15:14.933
when I got there, this year's commander

15:00.094 --> 15:14.933
put me in as director of safety for

15:00.094 --> 15:14.933
the 7th Air Force. 5th Air Force. What was your 
opinion of that mode, being director of safety? I

15:22.378 --> 15:32.173
didn't want it, but I didn't have any choice, so I 
just went in and did the best job I could. What did

15:32.434 --> 15:33.696
you think of flying jets? This must have been your 
first time, wasn't it? Yes, I enjoyed it. It was

15:38.583 --> 15:41.468
completely different because you forgot about 
TARC. You didn't have to worry about TARC. You

15:43.591 --> 15:45.574
didn't have to worry about takeoff control.

15:51.157 --> 16:07.659
The acceleration

15:51.157 --> 16:07.659
is not

15:51.157 --> 16:07.659
there that you have

15:51.157 --> 16:07.659
on a prop aircraft. The acceleration of the 
airplane is low speed. And the reaction is not the

16:09.322 --> 16:11.284
same. It's harder to fly formation, again, when 
you tend to over-control the throttle. But it's a

16:12.987 --> 16:17.012
great advance in aviation in these aircraft. What 
about as far as the armaments, the firepower of the

16:17.583 --> 16:23.689
F-86 versus those P-47s? Well, there's no 
comparison to the F-86s. So much more firepower

16:27.873 --> 16:37.542
than the other

16:27.873 --> 16:37.542
F-86s. Just all the difference in the world. Now, 
when you got to Korea, the war was almost over.

16:42.006 --> 16:44.248
Yeah, the war was there.

16:47.350 --> 16:53.919
But I did get into the 86 for a while. You did get to do 
some flying in February of 54 and May of 54. You were

17:01.430 --> 17:04.795
the commander of the 18th bomb group. Fighter 
bomber. Yeah, fighter bomber group in Korea. You

17:10.723 --> 17:13.527
didn't get to go on any missions because by that 
time The war was over by that time. Yeah, but I did

17:17.593 --> 17:21.318
get to do some experimental missions. Oh, really? 
Tell me about those. They had some planes coming

17:23.380 --> 17:42.062
down at night, and so we ran an experiment, the 
F-86, to try to get on the tail of one of these with

17:23.380 --> 17:42.062
radar.

17:45.738 --> 17:51.725
get up close enough so you could eyeball it and 
shoot them down. We never were able to get it all

17:51.905 --> 17:56.130
together. What do you mean you weren't able to? 
Well, we had to be ready to go and then they would

18:02.497 --> 18:14.631
scramble you off and vector you in by radar onto the 
tail of the airplane. Then

18:15.488 --> 18:22.959
you get close enough to eyeball it and shoot it 
down. They never were able to vector, keep the

18:25.764 --> 18:44.432
low-level aircraft on their scope enough to give 
us enough perspective to give him enough time so

18:25.764 --> 18:44.432
that we could intercept it.

18:47.905 --> 18:49.187
How'd you get along with the Koreans? Did you fly at 
all with any of the Korean Air Force, or didn't they

18:49.227 --> 18:57.757
have jets at this time? We got along fine with them. 
I don't think we had jets at that time. Did you fly

19:05.426 --> 19:06.908
any joint missions with them? No. How about with 
other U.N. forces? We had a squadron of South

19:10.732 --> 19:14.857
Africans. They went home. How'd you get along with 
them? Great.

19:25.335 --> 19:26.356
They were terrific people. Very enthusiastic.

19:32.605 --> 19:33.406
They were pretty wild. Wild in what way? Well, they 
liked to party.

19:47.221 --> 19:49.403
They had their own little club. They had arm 
wrestling, leg wrestling. Oh, kidding. Yeah.

19:56.311 --> 19:58.894
And, uh, corrals. They really sang

19:58.934 --> 20:06.281
and acted like Zulu warriors. Did they get along 
pretty well? Yes, they got along great. That's

20:10.286 --> 20:11.547
what they were like. And we also had some 
Australians on the legs, too. They were real nice,

20:15.491 --> 20:17.093
too.

20:24.228 --> 20:25.651
How were they? Were they as well trained as we were 
in America? Well, I really had no access to their

20:30.500 --> 20:37.053
abilities, except that they flew well.

20:40.219 --> 20:41.962
Seemed to be well trained. Okay. Speaking of South 
Africans,

20:56.645 --> 21:06.940
And during the war in Korea, of course, we did 
integrate the forces, ship from segregated units

20:56.645 --> 21:06.940
to integrated units. Did this have any impact on 
the Air Force when you were over in Korea? Not

21:14.330 --> 21:14.731
really. Dan Davis came over and took over one of the 
wings. I inspected him and gave him a safety

21:20.399 --> 21:23.563
inspection. He's a close friend of mine. I like 
him. No problem. He had no race problems? They

21:32.230 --> 21:43.425
may have had some in the Army, but we didn't have any 
aircraft.

21:54.475 --> 21:56.878
Oh, really? Well,

21:57.158 --> 22:02.424
I don't know. There were quite a

22:02.644 --> 22:11.654
few. There were several that Steve had. We had had 
in the war, hadn't we? There were quite a few. I

22:15.418 --> 22:18.161
don't have any feel for the numbers, but there were 
quite a few. Oh, is your opinion that Truman's move

22:18.181 --> 22:22.206
to integrate the armed forces? I think he was 
right. Probably. think we should be okay of course

22:25.289 --> 22:50.588
it came much earlier than the rest of the society 
and some some officers charged at the time back in

22:25.289 --> 22:50.588
48 that the at the air force the military the armed 
forces in general uh were being or shouldn't be the

22:25.289 --> 22:50.588
social engineers for the rest of the society did 
you hear any of this

22:56.153 --> 22:58.576
No, not really. You thought it was a good move, 
though? I thought it was a good move. OK. Also

23:03.482 --> 23:11.552
during the mid-1950s, there was the rise of the 
Strategic Air Command. And other Air Force

23:12.733 --> 23:25.789
officers have told me that there was

23:12.733 --> 23:25.789
some feelings of Air Force officers who weren't 
with SAC about that command. No,

23:27.845 --> 23:53.852
I think it's very necessary command, and I think it 
was handled well, and they did give them a priority

23:27.845 --> 23:53.852
that enabled them to get what they got, but that's 
what it took to get it.

23:55.807 --> 23:59.751
They did neglect the tactical air command, which 
they did or did not. They did in favor of the

24:00.252 --> 24:16.189
strategic air command, but that was 
understandable in my opinion because

24:00.252 --> 24:16.189
the tactical air command is support for the Army. 
And what we needed was strategic air, which we

24:17.570 --> 24:22.355
didn't have, and we needed. That's the way we got 
it.

24:27.481 --> 24:39.334
Although I didn't want to be in the security 
command, I think it's proven its effectiveness

24:27.481 --> 24:39.334
and its usefulness. Why didn't you want to be in it? 
I wanted to be a fire pilot, not a bomber pilot. You

24:45.321 --> 24:57.454
yourself never felt tense or anxious about the 
fact that SAC was getting higher priority than

24:58.413 --> 25:05.643
TAC?

25:05.663 --> 25:11.270
Well, I may have had a little feeling about that, 
but I saw the reason for it. It

25:11.531 --> 25:18.520
didn't upset me, because I did see the reason. How 
about the other fighter pilots? Did they see the

25:20.903 --> 25:23.427
reason? No. Was there tension between TAC and SAC? 
I don't know about tension. It may have been

25:33.981 --> 25:34.982
resentment. Do you remember any examples

25:35.002 --> 25:53.880
of resentment? I don't know. Specific

25:54.221 --> 25:57.584
examples, no. OK, and hard. That's hard to think 
back and think of specifically. I've heard

26:04.292 --> 26:09.299
opinions of us at the Air University. What was 
their opinion? By TAC members, these are the SACs.

26:19.152 --> 26:22.717
What was the general feeling at the Air 
University? Well, the Air University was

26:22.737 --> 26:28.545
far-sighted

26:22.737 --> 26:28.545
all the way.

26:32.761 --> 26:34.122
probably the origins thing. Well, of course, 
during this period, TV movies were glamorizing

26:35.984 --> 26:41.049
the Strategic Air Command. There were a couple of 
movies about these dashing young bomber pilots

26:41.069 --> 26:48.136
and their role in the mission. Did this create any 
jealousy or hard feelings in TAC?

26:58.085 --> 26:58.426
I don't think so. Did you see any of those movies? I 
doubt it. I don't go to movies. Okay. Also at this

27:08.009 --> 27:16.203
time, 53, you became a full colonel.

27:16.223 --> 27:21.131
What were your feelings when you heard that? I 
didn't believe it. Why not? I don't know.

27:34.861 --> 27:36.824
Well, competition was pretty keen. It sure is. It 
is and was. Very keen.

27:53.130 --> 28:01.543
That's not to say I wasn't extremely pleased and 
happy.

28:18.483 --> 28:23.471
Well, you always think there's a possibility. The 
probability is quite small.

28:28.159 --> 28:41.401
Selection,

28:28.159 --> 28:41.401
you've got more competition to be a general and a 
colonel than you

28:28.159 --> 28:41.401
do anywhere else. Okay. Here we are in 1954, and you 
have a series of assignments.

28:49.381 --> 28:50.763
Arbitration Committee. Oh, that's what I... I was 
moved and I was sent to... Nellis Air Force Base. I

28:57.872 --> 29:16.297
was sent home early to be on the representative for 
the Far Eastern Air Command on the Arbitration

28:57.872 --> 29:16.297
Committee for the Fighter

28:57.872 --> 29:16.297
Reference. Not much of a job. It was only a month. 
Well, you know, you're just there during the

29:19.177 --> 29:27.626
exercises, during the competition.

29:27.646 --> 29:31.871
And then what do you do, basically grade the 
competition? No, the arbitration committee

29:31.971 --> 29:45.527
solves disputes and questions of rules and 
regulations and protests and the final

29:31.971 --> 29:45.527
determination of who's the winner.

29:48.764 --> 29:53.531
How did you like that type of assignment? It wasn't 
much of an assignment. It was a boondocking for it,

29:54.433 --> 29:56.176
I was concerned. I stayed in Las Vegas. Oh, did you 
in Las Vegas? No, I stayed out at the base because

29:58.619 --> 30:01.744
you could go to Las Vegas every night. That sounds 
like more fun than work. It was more fun than work.

30:08.295 --> 30:15.025
Okay, so then you had another quick assignment in 
Texas, the advanced flying school. Well, I went to

30:15.190 --> 30:28.025
Perrin Air Force Base as the group commander, and 
they sent me through the F-86 flying school, the

30:15.190 --> 30:28.025
F-86D, which is the interceptor. So I just went 
through the course. And then you became the

30:28.746 --> 30:33.031
commander of the group, training group. Of the 
training group. And you did that for about a year

30:34.653 --> 30:39.739
and a half, from October 54 to January 1956. Now, 
what were major challenges at that job?

30:45.683 --> 30:49.988
Well, the F-86D was a complicated electronic 
machine. And we were also trying to determine how

30:51.049 --> 30:58.897
well the weapon system worked. And we did a lot of 
evaluation of the firing system down at Matagorda

30:59.238 --> 31:09.149
Island. And we were able to get our airplanes 
combat ready. They were able to fire the rockets

31:15.839 --> 31:25.714
and hit

31:15.839 --> 31:25.714
the target. The challenge was to qualify the 
students. How many students did you usually have

31:30.702 --> 31:39.956
in a class?

31:39.976 --> 31:41.118
Gee, that's hard to remember. I think we were 
around 50.

31:45.573 --> 31:57.693
40 to 50 students per class, and you'd have about 
three classes there at a time.

31:57.713 --> 32:05.487
One would be in academics, one would be in 
instrument training, and the other one would be in

31:57.713 --> 32:05.487
. I gave her instrument training in .

32:11.459 --> 32:33.859
Because

32:11.459 --> 32:33.859
this was an all-weather aircraft. And we 
qualified everybody. Even though we already had

32:34.439 --> 32:36.581
an estimate card, we re-qualified to make sure 
they could fly in a jet aircraft. Because we got

32:36.601 --> 32:38.303
some people who had not been particularly 
experienced in jet aircraft. Sure. And then we

32:38.443 --> 32:39.223
checked them out every six. And we had a flying crew 
there, too. Because you had earlier schools

32:40.838 --> 32:50.773
checking you out back in the 40s on prop planes, and 
now here you are checking other people out on jet

32:40.838 --> 32:50.773
planes. What kind of changes did the Air Force have 
to make? I mean, did they increase the length of the

32:55.721 --> 32:58.224
school? Yes, we increased the ground school part 
of it. Familiarization with the airplane was a lot

33:02.531 --> 33:09.141
longer and much more complicated. more 
complicated systems. Sure. And you had to

33:11.792 --> 33:17.583
understand how the systems work and how they 
relate to each other. And to know when an airplane

33:17.603 --> 33:20.708
was safe to fly and when it wasn't safe to fly. And 
also what the emergency procedures are, what you

33:20.788 --> 33:27.019
do if this fails or that fails. And we also had 
simulator, which

33:33.151 --> 33:35.974
We had completely new technology. And you could 
put the guy under the hood and have him take the

33:36.154 --> 33:44.403
airplane off and land it without effort.

33:44.423 --> 33:46.284
And he could simulate a complete mission. I bet you 
that. Intercept training and everything else.

33:49.488 --> 33:50.689
We'd give him intercept training. Right in the 
simulator? Right in the simulator, which is an

33:51.830 --> 33:55.574
innovation at that time. I bet. And now we've got it 
in all of them. Sure, but isn't it? At that time, it

33:59.818 --> 34:01.420
was a real innovation.

34:05.399 --> 34:18.076
So

34:05.399 --> 34:18.076
you probably had very low amount or percentage of 
crashes by the 50s after the simulator than in the

34:05.399 --> 34:18.076
40s, is that true? That's true. As a matter of fact, 
safety has been a prime mission of the Air Force.

34:27.792 --> 34:34.260
Sure,

34:27.792 --> 34:34.260
absolutely. And

34:34.721 --> 34:48.518
in comparison with your command at the training 
group, in comparison with other training groups

34:34.721 --> 34:48.518
in the country, how was your accident rate?

34:59.939 --> 35:02.542
Well, I don't know how it was compared with it. But 
didn't they give you comparative figures? Oh,

35:05.026 --> 35:08.911
yes, they gave you comparative figures, but I sure 
as heck can't remember. Oh. The accident rate in

35:09.792 --> 35:18.663
the F-86D was fairly

35:09.792 --> 35:18.663
high per flying hour, because that's the way they 
measure. There's so many accidents per 100,000

35:18.683 --> 35:23.569
flying hours. The frequency of accidents was 
relatively low. It's your only airborne short

35:26.393 --> 35:27.955
time. So your exposure is greater on takeoff and 
landing

35:28.424 --> 35:42.480
than it is at any other time. You could take a V-52 
and keep it up for 20 to 30 hours and only be exposed

35:42.501 --> 35:48.988
to one landing and one takeoff. Sure. Whereas if 
you took a fighter airplane, you'd have about 30

35:51.571 --> 35:57.198
missions. Sure. that's 30 take-offs. That's a lot 
more exposure to the dangerous part of it. And also

36:03.821 --> 36:07.004
you've got the reliability of an engine. One 
engine versus six.

36:12.110 --> 36:16.194
So you can, sure, your odds are greater. What was 
your opinion then of the quality of the B-52 and now

36:16.234 --> 36:25.144
of its Because there's been a lot of controversy 
about this, I think. Well, the B-52, in the

36:30.842 --> 36:36.771
beginning, was a hell of an airplane. And it could 
walk away from an F-86D, climb up the altitude. The

36:43.903 --> 36:51.536
F-86D was not in the performance range that we have 
now. But the B-52 was a good airplane. But we need a

36:54.014 --> 37:06.912
bigger, faster, probably not necessarily 
bigger, but a faster and better airplane than the

36:54.014 --> 37:06.912
B-52. We need the B-1. And how do you feel about the 
cruise missile and the deployment of the cruise

37:08.374 --> 37:15.564
missile and the B-52? I think we ought to have the 
cruise missile and the B-52.

37:29.215 --> 37:35.323
Not build the B-1, but wanted to just put the cruise 
missile in the B-52. And what was your opinion of

37:35.503 --> 37:36.665
that? I think he made a mistake. A big mistake. It 
helped get him defeated, I think. So, you'd want

37:49.723 --> 37:52.466
both then? Yes. You want the B-1 and the cruise 
missile in the B-52?

37:58.966 --> 37:59.947
I think we need them both. Okay, now just explain to 
the layman himself what's the advantage of the

38:00.308 --> 38:09.961
B-1, besides speed? Penetration. Penetration.

38:15.389 --> 38:21.877
You can send all the missiles over where you want 
to, but once you program them, that's all they got.

38:22.238 --> 38:26.644
Once you program them, you have no control. Sure. 
When you send a V1, you've got full control. And

38:31.785 --> 38:37.633
you've also got a computer in there that can think, 
not just react.

38:40.857 --> 38:43.640
A guy can change. He can alter. He can alter his 
ultimate target or mission. Sure. Hold it.

38:58.636 --> 39:03.901
And if something happens, he has the proper 
procedures to follow. So more flexibility. More

39:05.262 --> 39:07.865
flexibility and more capability. OK. OK. Now, 
were you sorry that you left the command of the

39:08.265 --> 39:18.715
training, or were you ready to leave that?

39:18.735 --> 39:21.918
I was sorry to leave that command, very much so. I 
let it be known that I'd rather stay there, but they

39:24.220 --> 39:27.343
said, We want you down here. And then you came down 
to Randolph Air Force Base, but only for about five

39:29.870 --> 39:36.499
months. No, I was there about a year and a half. Oh, 
I'm sorry. You're right. You were there from

39:40.184 --> 39:43.529
February 56 to August 57. And what was your job 
there? Director of Crew Training. I wrote the

39:47.714 --> 39:52.200
syllabuses for all the crew training. We had the 
F-86D. So this is basically a promotion, wasn't

39:55.960 --> 39:58.424
it? Well, yeah. Because now you, as the director of 
crew training, you're not just the commander of

39:59.686 --> 40:09.440
one of the training groups, but now you're the 
director of a number of commanders? Well, I was in

40:10.201 --> 40:17.112
charge of all the training groups for all the crew 
training air force bases. No kidding. We had the

40:20.196 --> 40:24.803
F-100, F-4, and... We

40:26.504 --> 40:51.524
had

40:26.504 --> 40:51.524
the KC-97 rammed off. We had the helicopter 
training. We had the special weapons training,

40:52.185 --> 40:54.027
fighter training, bomber training, and special 
weapons. And your job is? and design the courses?

40:57.974 --> 40:58.255
Yes. So you're back in education again? Well, more 
in training than education. It's training. You

41:06.987 --> 41:10.111
must have had a good-sized staff to help you. I had 
three good-sized staff. How many?

41:23.110 --> 41:26.194
About 12 officers and airmen.

41:30.376 --> 41:34.200
How'd you like that job?

41:34.220 --> 41:37.222
It was a very challenging job.

41:39.024 --> 41:41.446
It really was. To be familiar with all those 
different training programs. There was a great

41:44.389 --> 41:47.212
diversity of aircraft involved. I would think so. 
How'd you ever stay on top of that? B-47s. We

41:50.875 --> 41:51.856
actually had B-47 training. I grew up going on a 
B-47 mission. It was very, very educational

42:00.380 --> 42:22.725
to get involved with all these different programs 
and then have to go up and training command and

42:00.380 --> 42:22.725
defend them

42:00.380 --> 42:22.725
and get the right number of days to just to help with 
the courses they always want to shorten the

42:00.380 --> 42:22.725
courses make them shorter we had to fight for all 
the for the time you think they actually needed.

42:26.029 --> 42:26.750
Now, who did you fight? Did you fight politicians 
or did you fight... No, no, training command and

42:26.770 --> 42:31.977
ESEF headquarters. Okay. We'd have a yearly 
meeting with the training command headquarters

42:32.758 --> 42:43.833
with people from the Pentagon.

42:43.853 --> 42:52.564
Have a lockdown drag out of time, how much time it 
took. Get them USAF to understand

42:53.671 --> 43:16.702
what it took to produce what they love. It was 
interesting. How could you ever become

43:17.123 --> 43:22.530
proficient on all the different on training on all 
the different types of airplanes? I couldn't. No

43:27.022 --> 43:31.308
way I could, but I had people under me who were, who 
had done it. So you selected experts on each plane?

43:34.452 --> 43:37.556
I had experts in each area, too. Were you given 
pretty much a free hand to pick these people? Well,

43:40.861 --> 43:52.416
the director of personnel, if you had an opening, 
the director of personnel would allow you to get

43:40.861 --> 43:52.416
people you'd select from, Or if you knew someone 
out in one of the bases. For instance, if I knew

43:56.337 --> 44:10.338
somebody at Perrin and I wanted to be in charge of 
interceptor training, I'd get, I could, if they

43:56.337 --> 44:10.338
were available, I could get

43:56.337 --> 44:10.338
them. Or they gave me, they'd send me folders and 
say you select which one you want. What airplanes

44:14.965 --> 44:19.973
were the toughest for our pilots to learn to fly, 
which ones have the highest accident rate? Well,

44:25.031 --> 44:28.896
being tough to fly and high accident rate don't 
necessarily correlate. Oh, I know. I'm just

44:29.777 --> 44:31.500
asking you two questions at once.

44:43.856 --> 44:47.361
Gee, it'd be hard to put that in perspective.

45:00.132 --> 45:20.187
I

45:00.132 --> 45:20.187
don't

45:00.132 --> 45:20.187
remember which one had the highest action rate. A 
lot of them. I don't even remember which one had the

45:20.508 --> 45:21.710
highest action rate. I do...

45:24.989 --> 45:31.495
Things like when they were first checking out in 
the B-26s, they talked about one a day in Tampa Bay.

45:32.275 --> 45:32.716
Oh, really? And did you lose about one a day? That's 
the way it looked like, but that's back when we were

45:36.259 --> 45:39.822
old, too. We didn't know that. We just got that 
rumor, I guess.

45:48.850 --> 45:54.675
I really don't know which one I would select to be 
the hardest to fly.

45:58.115 --> 46:01.178
Did you have more mechanical problems with one 
versus another? Because, you know, this is a big

46:03.701 --> 46:11.089
question as far as... F-86D

46:03.701 --> 46:11.089
was a very complicated airplane. And then it got 
more complicated, though, when we got to the

46:12.731 --> 46:17.196
F-105. The F-105 was the ultimate plane for one 
guy. And ever since then, every airplane has had

46:21.881 --> 46:25.945
two guys instead of one. And that's the F-105 right 
there.

46:31.307 --> 46:42.204
To

46:31.307 --> 46:42.204
do the complete mission, I'd have to say that was 
the hardest one to teach somebody to fly. The 105.

46:43.285 --> 46:44.127
The 105. To do the complete mission.

46:49.495 --> 46:51.498
Because you had to do it all yourself. And it 
included low-level navigation. high-level

46:56.114 --> 47:11.288
navigation, and atomic bomb delivery,

46:56.114 --> 47:11.288
and gunnery,

46:56.114 --> 47:11.288
and rocketry, bombing, a whole smidge of 
everything.
