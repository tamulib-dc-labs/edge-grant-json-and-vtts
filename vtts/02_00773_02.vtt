WEBVTT

00:00.031 --> 00:10.223
How was it that Dr. Suttle was involved? Well, Dr. 
Suttle was involved.

00:16.470 --> 00:20.435
He was fairly active in the cyclotron project. 
More detail end up with that. We went into the arts

00:22.237 --> 00:26.882
and science. Dr. Sowell and Mr. Ruddard used him 
primarily

00:28.465 --> 00:37.339
for his research know-how. He built our research

00:38.942 --> 00:53.384
programs here university-wide, not just 
engineering, and also to assess

00:38.942 --> 00:53.384
people. He used to sit in on all of the places we 
used. It was out of the value of commanding the

00:54.366 --> 00:56.329
system. which is almost entirely from the 
research point of view, which is why I didn't mind

00:58.756 --> 01:13.867
one thing or give it to some of the other fellows who 
had responsibility

00:58.756 --> 01:13.867
for the education side of things. But Suttle was 
the advocate of research, technically. Now there

01:18.888 --> 01:30.378
are lots of stories that float around about the 
psychotron and the funding for the psychotron.

01:30.398 --> 01:36.563
One of them I've heard that I don't, I wonder if 
there's a myth in that, is that Princeton was

01:30.398 --> 01:36.563
supposed to get the money and Princeton already 
had a bulldog for it. Is that a mere myth? I don't

01:39.506 --> 01:42.128
think it was Princeton, I think it was Maryland. We 
in Maryland were essentially competitors and we

01:42.148 --> 01:47.933
got the money. And

01:48.706 --> 01:54.233
really it's been a very useful instrument. 
Shortly after we brought it here,

01:54.253 --> 02:11.056
of course, they determined that this was a useful

01:54.253 --> 02:11.056
device for treating cancer.

02:11.076 --> 02:17.084
So we worked, you know, for years with the MD 
Anderson people in Houston. One of our young men in

02:17.104 --> 02:18.105
nuclear engineering. at UCLA now. We developed 
the procedures for determining the dose rates

02:22.250 --> 02:38.493
required to treat people and essentially

02:22.250 --> 02:38.493
we developed that procedure. Now of course it's 
much more sophisticated now. Most of the major

02:41.698 --> 02:48.227
cancer facilities have their own beam machines, 
not all of them are cyclotrons that they use for

02:41.698 --> 02:48.227
treatment. for the work actually. Didn't 
radiation therapy go on, research go on here even

02:50.711 --> 02:56.298
in the 50s? We were big in that. That's one I forgot. 
We were very big in radiation research. Right

03:02.306 --> 03:18.147
after World War II, Sidney Brown, who was a 
biologist, did most of his work in the engineering

03:02.306 --> 03:18.147
sperm stations, but we were the only people who 
were really supporting and encouraging to get on

03:02.306 --> 03:18.147
with this. And

03:19.088 --> 03:33.682
then we used to do a lot of these work with Spanish 
goats. We kept those Spanish goats out there right

03:33.702 --> 03:37.726
next to the nuclear science center. And that old 
facility is still out there. It's not used to it,

03:40.709 --> 03:41.510
but you can see it. It's pretty well fallen down due 
to the wooden construction. Sidney Brown, at one

03:42.871 --> 03:46.615
time, was probably one of the leading experts in 
this country in radiation protection. Is this the

03:47.557 --> 03:56.266
same type of research that has been going on in the 
60s with the medical radiation therapy? I suppose

03:56.426 --> 04:00.109
they were joined together sometime, but not here. 
If that joining was done, it was probably not going

04:00.249 --> 04:04.013
to be answered. George Price was the last man. I 
don't know if you've run into Price or not. George

04:08.277 --> 04:14.744
Price was the last man that we had in the radiation 
biology area. Of course, that sort of... research

04:18.995 --> 04:31.272
has not been done much in recent years. What

04:31.292 --> 04:41.907
year,

04:31.292 --> 04:41.907
or approximately what year was it that you got the 
MD Anderson and the Keys got together? I would

04:41.927 --> 04:43.770
guess it was sometime in the 70s, early 70s.

04:48.712 --> 04:53.978
I don't think we did, did we? Maybe we did. It

04:55.319 --> 05:08.354
started pretty quickly after Psychotron was 
finished. I don't know what I want. The catalogue,

05:09.075 --> 05:12.559
and that's the directory of former troops, when 
things happened.

05:30.005 --> 05:55.297
Okay,

05:30.005 --> 05:55.297
that was, the

05:30.005 --> 05:55.297
cyclotron was erected

05:30.005 --> 05:55.297
in 67,

05:30.005 --> 05:55.297
about six million dollars. So I would guess that 
work started even in 69 or 70. Well, it started

05:56.378 --> 05:58.020
pretty quickly after we had the cyclotron.

06:01.038 --> 06:26.463
Which

06:01.038 --> 06:26.463
of the many projects that CASE has started since 
you've been here are you most proud of being

06:01.038 --> 06:26.463
involved in? I don't know. I enjoyed all of the work 
that we did. It's really hard to say. I suppose that

06:28.747 --> 06:44.950
the work that I'm most proud of actually is the 
highway safety research work that we started for

06:28.747 --> 06:44.950
the Transportation

06:28.747 --> 06:44.950
Institute. Because I was almost directly 
responsible for getting that started. A lot of

06:46.332 --> 06:48.695
people said we couldn't do it. We began that work 
back in the early 63. and the breakaway signs and

06:55.460 --> 07:09.864
the impact attenuators that have been built on 
highways around this country have saved lots of

06:55.460 --> 07:09.864
people's lives. And those are all developed here? 
Those are all developed here. You can find lots of

07:15.354 --> 07:18.659
people playing a responsibility for it later in 
the year. We know where it all came from. And

07:19.320 --> 07:20.522
unfortunately we didn't happen to be able to see 
it. It was all done in the open area. Oil shortage

07:24.097 --> 07:36.497
in the mid-70s affected research. Yes. When the 
oil shortage came along, it was pretty obvious

07:38.440 --> 07:48.316
that ultimately there had to be a replacement for 
petroleum. And it's still true. Ultimately,

07:50.059 --> 07:50.560
we've got it. So we began then to take a look at what 
are

07:52.109 --> 08:08.268
alternate fuels that you can use to replace

07:52.109 --> 08:08.268
petroleum. Of course when you do that you begin to 
look at the fuels that you can get from coal, from

08:08.288 --> 08:18.520
renewable resources like wood and plant 
materials and that sort of thing. So we started

08:18.540 --> 08:19.281
with our organ fuels program and a chemical 
engineering people that developed a system that

08:22.214 --> 08:39.679
was able to run the standard automobile that was 
sold in this country on methanol, methyl alcohol,

08:22.214 --> 08:39.679
and that was successful. We started a program in 
which we were trying to Recovered gas from late

08:43.578 --> 08:54.234
night by burning it in the

08:43.578 --> 08:54.234
ground. That wasn't very successful. And we took a 
look at a lot of other things like flurry

08:54.835 --> 09:10.418
suspension of the coal, other

08:54.835 --> 09:10.418
ways of burning coal. We did quite a wide variety of 
research. problems

09:11.827 --> 09:36.781
came into being, most of which are still . Was TCI 
involved in the search of the 55 speed limit in

09:36.801 --> 09:39.545
terms of energy consumption? No. That was done 
because I was . Anybody think there's anything

09:40.246 --> 09:41.327
substantial about that? Have

09:43.568 --> 10:06.922
you had any

09:43.568 --> 10:06.922
changes

09:43.568 --> 10:06.922
in your attitude over time? Looking back, when you 
first took the job, his is still the same, and his

10:06.942 --> 10:09.345
goals are still the same. No, I haven't changed my 
mind about what we ought to do. goals

10:11.783 --> 10:23.776
we have to try to reach. Essentially a two-fold 
goal, to carry on activities which would be

10:23.836 --> 10:35.908
important in the state of Texas and to contribute 
to the educational programs here in Indiana. We

10:35.928 --> 10:37.690
work from time to time with a lot of other programs 
besides this.

10:40.842 --> 10:57.907
I would ask your opinion on a definition that is 
often argued over, the difference

10:40.842 --> 10:57.907
between pure

10:40.842 --> 10:57.907
science and technology. What they generally say 
is that if you look at the basics of what you call

10:57.927 --> 11:03.475
pure science,

11:06.695 --> 11:21.315
done for no good reason

11:06.695 --> 11:21.315
except just to know what's

11:06.695 --> 11:21.315
going on. We have

11:21.836 --> 11:26.643
to know what the facts are. Whereas most applied 
research is all technology, I guess. It really has

11:28.806 --> 11:30.228
a basic goal. It's an alternative fuel project. We 
started out with the idea that methanol was

11:32.551 --> 11:35.335
probably our best fuel

11:36.783 --> 11:57.735
the standpoint of competitiveness economics.

11:57.755 --> 12:02.061
And that if we were going to be forced to use it, that 
we'd have to take the automobiles right off the

11:57.755 --> 12:02.061
street and convert them. And we did that 
successfully. That's very much applied to . Is

12:03.665 --> 12:10.592
there any other, are there any other projects that 
I haven't asked you about? Well, there probably

12:10.612 --> 12:11.433
are some. I know there are others.

12:15.117 --> 12:19.762
Don't want to be an old man like I am just to slip you 
by. One thing I'd like to ask you is what is your

12:19.782 --> 12:25.668
exact title? Exact title? Well, I'm Dean 
Emeritus. Okay. I'm working part-time for the and

12:32.234 --> 12:37.120
for them, I'm a research engineer.

12:37.881 --> 12:43.468
Well, I had read that you retired in 1980, was it? 
Yeah, 1980. But you maintained your connections

12:44.650 --> 12:48.175
with the Research Foundation? I stayed on with the 
Research Foundation because I felt I had not

12:48.195 --> 12:57.266
really done for them what I should. And they paid 
part of my salary. No,

13:00.517 --> 13:24.521
I was over there two years. I had several 
connections with them in 82. Last year I didn't do

13:25.402 --> 13:26.023
anything. I didn't get paid. This year I'm working 
on a project. Are you working on a particular

13:27.144 --> 13:28.125
project for them? No, I generally work on taking a 
look at things. We ought to be doing it or not. We

13:35.483 --> 13:36.924
ought to quit or that sort of thing. And in that 
general direction, how has TEAS established over

13:36.944 --> 13:45.652
the years what projects are

13:36.944 --> 13:45.652
ready to die? Well, that's a tough question. 
That's, of course, the hardest question of all of

13:48.074 --> 13:51.637
them. We need to reach the point where it's been 
worthwhile for any more time than that would do it

13:53.299 --> 13:58.283
for us. You may have

13:59.613 --> 14:16.134
heard there's a plan going on right now about 
nuclear weapons, what we ought to do about it. The

14:16.154 --> 14:17.997
time has come when those decisions are going to 
have to be made. The American people are very

14:18.017 --> 14:26.127
scared to death of having any sort of nuclear 
involvements, power, what have you. So

14:28.216 --> 14:52.989
it looks like this is something that

14:28.216 --> 14:52.989
really may not be worthwhile doing at this time. 
Take a look at it and see whether or not this is the

14:53.009 --> 14:54.711
time to abandon it. We did a lot of work here in the 
early years of our nuclear program in an area we

14:54.731 --> 14:57.835
called Activation Analysis. But

14:59.502 --> 15:19.614
that's still going

14:59.502 --> 15:19.614
on here in the Department

14:59.502 --> 15:19.614
of Chemistry. But we decided, for our purposes, 
that we had reached the end of the line, and we

15:19.634 --> 15:24.322
transferred the program to chemistry, and they 
changed it to a much more fun little type program.

15:24.342 --> 15:26.185
In terms of administration, in the late 50s, Teas 
also became administrator of The

15:26.502 --> 15:41.143
data processing center

15:26.502 --> 15:41.143
and all those, is this a purely administrative 
function or? No. Why was this, why? The reason we

15:42.165 --> 15:47.252
were in the computer business is because we were 
the only ones that would do it. We were the only ones

15:47.272 --> 15:49.275
that could do it. Yeah, the experiment station, a 
very small 5DM machine in our direction. That

15:56.185 --> 16:09.362
said, I do

15:56.185 --> 16:09.362
not think it applies for us to put any more of our 
research into this arena than we have now. We

16:09.382 --> 16:14.389
cannot support the education program, research 
programs, and engineering as much as we can. So, if

16:14.409 --> 16:21.298
there's going to be anything more sophisticated 
around here, somebody else is going to take it up.

16:22.291 --> 16:47.242
So

16:22.291 --> 16:47.242
we decided that we would see what we could do

16:22.291 --> 16:47.242
to produce the next processing program that would 
serve our engineering people and would also serve

16:22.291 --> 16:47.242
the college generally. It was actually a borrowed 
money. And we would buy the IBM 650, which was a

16:47.943 --> 16:49.345
working machine that we had. and

16:50.236 --> 17:09.357
we built

16:50.236 --> 17:09.357
the warden building and the

16:50.236 --> 17:09.357
processing

16:50.236 --> 17:09.357
center building over there. And over here, we 
steadily increase the capabilities of that

17:09.377 --> 17:13.522
facility. Of course, the computers are now facing 
the full scheme of things. The system is going back

17:15.023 --> 17:16.965
to a centralized type of system in which everybody 
has a computer. So there's not the need now to

17:16.985 --> 17:18.387
centralize the facility. Well, we ran that 
facility for years. And the truth of

17:27.912 --> 17:44.349
the matter is, we subsidized Texas A&M University 
very substantially in computing. The better part

17:44.369 --> 17:45.570
of that, they were cutting the church short. Why? 
They never would have wanted to work in the

17:45.690 --> 17:46.972
computer industry. Do we need to research, 
please? Are we used to engineering computers? I

17:49.805 --> 18:13.332
think it was worthwhile

17:49.805 --> 18:13.332
for

17:49.805 --> 18:13.332
Ortiz to get involved.

18:14.813 --> 18:17.016
From the standpoint of the total operation, yes. I 
think we made a real contribution to the whole

18:17.177 --> 18:23.606
thing. From the standpoint of the administrative 
headaches, the legislative headaches, and the

18:23.626 --> 18:34.963
arguments with the university,

18:23.626 --> 18:34.963
no. It wasn't until that time in our engineering 
program. But it wouldn't have gotten better. It

18:42.314 --> 18:43.015
wouldn't have gotten better. Do

18:43.568 --> 19:10.251
you feel

18:43.568 --> 19:10.251
that way about any of the other programs that are 
administrated by Phoenix? Was there an impact on

19:13.015 --> 19:23.289
the university

19:13.015 --> 19:23.289
as a whole? Well, there probably are

19:23.309 --> 19:41.414
no

19:23.309 --> 19:41.414
others that I can think of that the impact on the 
university as a whole. Did you have any of the, now

19:41.434 --> 19:42.195
that and

19:42.513 --> 20:03.381
has come

19:42.513 --> 20:03.381
up with the agreements with NTRM and that type of 
thing. Did you have any university cooperation at

20:03.401 --> 20:04.462
all? No, we didn't get to that point actually. The 
things that I did primarily were to try to work more

20:07.426 --> 20:09.129
broadly here on this campus. And we were too 
successful in those operations. the

20:11.943 --> 20:37.180
idea of going out and broadening the search for 
some of the other universities in the state while

20:11.943 --> 20:37.180
we talked about it. We never did that. It's not 
something that was brand new. It was an idea that

20:38.361 --> 20:39.062
was back there. Yeah, it was an idea. Is that the way 
you generally find

20:41.710 --> 20:55.650
research develops around here, ideas of a 
long-term career? Is there anything else you'd

20:55.670 --> 20:57.793
like to add? Offhand, I don't think, but it's been 
pretty well covered. It's been tough getting all

21:01.979 --> 21:10.131
that together, but it's been very informative. 
Well,

21:10.685 --> 21:29.749
I think the injury experimentation is going to be a 
great contribution to the story, and a great

21:10.685 --> 21:29.749
contribution to the state of Texas. The country is 
facing a lot of problems, and we're having a little

21:29.769 --> 21:31.712
more jealousy than we used to. So we can do what we 
have to do to get things done. That's my answer.

21:33.134 --> 21:33.334
Thank you.

21:37.870 --> 21:59.295
We actually

21:37.870 --> 21:59.295
had a pretty fair

21:37.870 --> 21:59.295
stake in starting

21:37.870 --> 21:59.295
the research program here in Mexico. Because that 
came out of the nuclear radiation out of the high

21:59.315 --> 22:00.817
towers. And we're here largely because of our 
cause. Well,

22:02.913 --> 22:16.628
it's very well since

22:02.913 --> 22:16.628
then. Haven't you done that often? You're at peace 
to develop something and hand it over and say, this

22:18.370 --> 22:31.965
is... Getting over that jealousy is what's

22:18.370 --> 22:31.965
hard. I'm not sure. Tried that out on some

22:32.950 --> 22:41.200
of my colleagues. They'd say I'm crazy, but that's 
the way I look at it. Well,

22:50.251 --> 22:55.558
I appreciate all your time. And I'm sure I'll come 
up with some other questions. I'm going to try to

22:56.639 --> 22:57.620
ask you particular questions. As far as the 
generator of goings, the 15 years I've been around

22:57.640 --> 22:59.783
here, most of that came out of right here. That's 
what it seems. He was with it.

23:04.388 --> 23:07.651
Was he the doer or was he the one who got others to do 
it? No, he was the one who got other people to do it.

23:14.318 --> 23:16.681
He was the medic. But I mean, he encouraged you. 
Yeah. Well, if you can get other people to do it. He

23:24.108 --> 23:24.969

23:34.578 --> 23:44.980
of difference to one another.

23:45.000 --> 23:46.103

23:46.183 --> 23:48.688
happened to me.
