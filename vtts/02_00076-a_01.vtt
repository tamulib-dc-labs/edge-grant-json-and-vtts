WEBVTT

00:02.528 --> 00:15.925
pleasure today of chatting with Davis Ford at his 
office in Austin about his recollections of life

00:02.528 --> 00:15.925
as a student at Texas A&M.

00:17.486 --> 00:19.449
Why did you attend A&M in the first place? Well, my 
father was an A&M man, class of 1926, and so I grew up

00:19.849 --> 00:28.540
with an A&M ethic. Went to football games when I was 
a kid. And so I was preordained to go there, and it

00:30.524 --> 00:36.212
was never in question. We lived in Lubbock, and of 
course grew up in the shadows of Texas Tech, but I

00:36.292 --> 00:43.681
was in A&M all the way, never in question. What were 
your earliest memories of visiting A&M? Well, I

00:48.428 --> 00:57.980
came up there on a high school day and brought five 
of my friends, best friends from Lubbock, who

00:48.428 --> 00:57.980
never really had any background at A&M 
whatsoever. I was... This is going to sound a bit

01:00.140 --> 01:01.381
ironic. I was amazed at how green and pretty it was 
in the springtime compared to Lubbock. In those

01:06.045 --> 01:12.191
days in Lubbock, you couldn't even see 10 feet 
ahead because of the sandstorms that we had back in

01:06.045 --> 01:12.191
the 50s. And I thought the whole world was hot and 
sandy and dust storms until I went down to College

01:13.372 --> 01:19.397
Station. I said, this is the most beautiful place 
I've ever seen. Some people kind of laugh at it

01:21.279 --> 01:25.402
today, but it was green and lush and trees and all. 
So I said, man, it's a pretty setting. And... We

01:29.047 --> 01:35.956
stayed in the dorms with corps members and all very 
impressed. So all five of the non-A&M background

01:36.456 --> 01:44.226
high school classmates of mine went to A&M, as long 
as it was me. So we have a total of six in Lubbock that

01:44.246 --> 01:46.269
year. When you came to enroll, how did you get 
there? Did you come on the train or the bus or the

01:49.413 --> 01:51.435
car? No. Nobody really had cars back in those days 
except for rich kids, of which I was not. My dad was a

01:58.325 --> 02:02.030
farmer, kind of middle class sort of guy. But two of 
my friends were pretty wealthy kids and they had

02:02.110 --> 02:05.075
cars. So six of us piled in two cars with all our 
trunks and luggage and go from Lubbock to College

02:05.135 --> 02:12.485
Station. Describe what you brought with you. We 
were all a little bit nervous because we knew about

02:16.892 --> 02:19.375
the Corps. I had a little bit more understanding 
what the weight of this than my five high school

02:20.036 --> 02:25.564
colleagues did. We just bought just kind of 
rudimentary stuff. I'll tell you what we didn't

02:28.034 --> 02:29.836
bring. We didn't bring golf clubs or tennis 
rackets. They were just kind of the bare

02:32.019 --> 02:33.781
essentials. We were all kind of, grew up in 
Lubbock, had the Lubbock ethic. No place in the

02:37.265 --> 02:40.268
world better being raised than Lubbock in the 
1950s. So we just bought kind of the typical

02:40.349 --> 02:44.033
things. No books, no tennis rackets, no golf 
clubs, just our basic stuff. Describe the campus

02:48.999 --> 02:52.903
physically when you got there. It was hot. And, of 
course, we were from kind of the dry part of the

02:54.147 --> 02:58.472
state, and we just sweated profusely. I could not 
believe how uncomfortable it was with the

02:58.512 --> 03:01.174
humidity. We were not used to that. I'm getting 
this later probably, but it was not a freshman

03:03.497 --> 03:08.002
privilege to have a fan in your room. Of course, 
none of the dorms were air-conditioned. The only

03:09.383 --> 03:13.708
air-conditioned building was the Cushing 
Library on campus to Mount Olive. Right. But

03:14.449 --> 03:17.792
describe the campus physically in terms of what 
buildings were where. Yeah. The dominant

03:19.274 --> 03:23.378
buildings, of course, were the Old Main, MSC, And 
then all the dorms that were built back in, I guess,

03:23.948 --> 03:30.874
the 30s, that was kind of the prominent place. The 
old President's Home, the old frame President's

03:31.915 --> 03:37.320
Home over by Spacer was still there. And it was not a 
pretty campus. It was a pretty setting, not really

03:39.683 --> 03:42.786
a pretty campus to speak of. There was no 
coordination of the buildings and all. It was

03:44.727 --> 03:50.833
enrollment, as I recall, in my freshman year, was 
about 6,000 or 7,000 students, virtually all

03:44.727 --> 03:50.833
cadet corps. How did you feel that you were treated 
as a new arrival? Horrible. Horrible. I thought I

03:57.557 --> 03:59.700
was pretty much a stud in high school. I had my hair 
and a lot of girlfriends. And I grew up in Lubbock

04:02.504 --> 04:06.149
High School doing things kids did. And over the day 
we hunted and fished and chased women and played

04:06.169 --> 04:09.474
football. Lubbock High School had been state 
champion for two or three years. The last four

04:14.381 --> 04:18.627
years we were the big football power, draw 25,000 
people to a game. And Texas Tech was not much of a

04:19.855 --> 04:24.101
football power in those days, so Lubbock High 
School was the place. So we thought we were big

04:24.121 --> 04:25.443
stuff. Came down to A&M, shaved my head, and I was 
miserable. Did you go through any kind of

04:30.350 --> 04:40.705
pre-class,

04:30.350 --> 04:40.705
pre-academic boot camp or any experience before? 
It wasn't exactly boot camp. They had what they

04:42.047 --> 04:43.209
called fish week. So the upperclassmen were not on 
campus. Describe fish week. The only people that

04:46.193 --> 04:49.137
were there were our CO and first sergeant. our 
outfits and it was just orientation there was no no

04:49.555 --> 05:18.853
hazing or anything it was just kind of an 
orientation of kind of stark setting but we were

04:49.555 --> 05:18.853
all nervous about when the upperclassmen 
particularly sophomores would get there a week

04:49.555 --> 05:18.853
hence so we were nervous but fish week was just more 
like any college orientation buying books

04:49.555 --> 05:18.853
getting issued from the army or our military uh 
apparel things like that. How'd you get assigned?

05:21.393 --> 05:22.094
How did you? We had some requests on what outfit we 
went in. I'd heard, I was in the Ordinance Corps,

05:25.418 --> 05:33.527
I'd heard that the Ordinance Corps was one of the 
better outfits on the campus and it had a lot of

05:25.418 --> 05:33.527
technical people, engineers, things like that. 
So it was, that was, I just requested it. And what

05:37.171 --> 05:41.255
was its identifying number and letter? A 
Ordinance. There was only one Ordinance outfit.

05:43.718 --> 05:44.639
Did it have a nickname? I don't think it did. 
Ordinance was, I heard this was the case before I

05:48.500 --> 05:52.648
got there, when I got in there. It was more, 
probably had more serious students than a lot of

05:52.668 --> 06:00.544
our colleagues, the jocks and infantry. Right, 
and you all were housed, your unit was housed

06:00.564 --> 06:03.751
where? Dorm 7. And that's in the quote, new dorm 
area? New dorm area. That was my freshman year was

06:07.759 --> 06:10.204
in Dorm 7. Was your roommate a special person in 
your life? Interesting. I phoned him Stacha,

06:16.102 --> 06:19.967
S-T-A-C-H-A, Anton Stacha. Good boy, from 
Clifton, Texas. And never, probably about the

06:24.934 --> 06:28.299
most provincial guy you've ever met in your life. 
Just a real country boy. Good guy. And did freshman

06:33.345 --> 06:37.871
roommates have a nickname then? Oh, yeah, 
official name. Same as it is now. And that

06:40.812 --> 06:44.796
friendship, has that proved lasting? Yeah, 
Statue is one of those guys who really was not

06:45.316 --> 06:50.160
college material, but he made it. Like a lot of 
freshmen who came into court at that time were

06:52.002 --> 06:57.006
really country boys. As you know, Andy was 
considered to be kind of the poor boy at school at

06:57.047 --> 07:01.330
that time. There's a lot of truth to that. It wasn't 
universally true, but there's some truth to it.

07:05.854 --> 07:07.116
I've lost contact with Statue. I don't know really 
whatever happened to him. My next roommate, my

07:09.533 --> 07:22.748
sophomore and junior years, is and was a lifetime 
friend of Jack McCrary, who was the best man at my

07:09.533 --> 07:22.748
wedding. M-C-C-R-A-R-Y.

07:27.013 --> 07:31.859
So he was the roommate that I developed a strong and 
lasting friendship with. I had dinner with him a

07:33.000 --> 07:35.423
week ago. make believe that I had never heard what 
it was like to be a freshman in the Corps of Cadets.

07:40.317 --> 07:40.898
Describe it. It was, I guess it was kind of a shock 
deal because it was, it was austere.

07:53.529 --> 08:00.776
They shaved your heads and when they shave your 
heads your

07:53.529 --> 08:00.776
love life ceases totally. You, we had to make 21 
formations I had

08:05.407 --> 08:15.942
the unfortunate talent of being a good typist, so I 
was the perk.

08:17.865 --> 08:19.627
Every hour was filled. I was very unhappy first 
semester. Also, I had no background in

08:25.776 --> 08:28.299
engineering. My dad was a farmer. Came from three 
generations of farmers. really went broke in the

08:34.195 --> 08:37.339
50s because of the drought that we had. He was in 
Catalan and farming and so it was a shock really to

08:37.380 --> 08:52.060
get into engineering and just academically plus 
the Corps of Cadets so it was it was traumatic.

08:52.942 --> 09:00.252
Describe if you will a typical weekday of routine 
what time to get up? Yeah it was regimented. It was

09:02.235 --> 09:02.916
regimented. It was We had first call at 6.30. We had 
formation, breakfast, then class, intramurals

09:06.743 --> 09:13.011
in the afternoon. Then we had study hall from 7.30 
to 10.30, lights out at 10.30. So it was a very

09:18.998 --> 09:22.582
mechanical, rigid type of a situation. 
Obviously, it's not a military school. It was a

09:25.766 --> 09:26.567
state school. So I don't want to imply it was like 
West Point or the Naval Academy, but it was pretty

09:27.087 --> 09:32.974
close to it. Let's see, did you go to, you ate in 
Duncan? I ate in Duncan every year except my senior

09:39.170 --> 09:44.477
year. Did y'all march to all three meals? Yes. Did 
you fall out and go? Yes. Describe a typical meal

09:49.945 --> 09:52.989
for a fish. You know, it's interesting. The most I 
guess the big protest of people who didn't know

09:56.343 --> 10:04.752
what to expect, like my five friends from Lubbock 
High School, was that we paid for this meal where we

09:56.343 --> 10:04.752
could never eat dessert. They would have cush 
questions, which were impossible to answer,

10:07.114 --> 10:10.798
particularly when it was good cush. If it was bad 
cush, it was easy questions. So we never ate

10:12.400 --> 10:14.242
dessert. Bushes sat erect and had a certain 
protocol as freshmen in the mess hall, which

10:14.262 --> 10:25.253
everything kind of had a purpose to it, but it was 
not a casual meal like I had today. Can you describe

10:25.688 --> 10:31.813
for me some of the dining hall food slang?

10:35.196 --> 10:35.877
Oh, gosh. Some of it was profane. Most of it was just 
kush, was dessert. Gunwaden was bread. I don't

10:47.867 --> 10:50.049
remember all of them, but everything had a name to 
it. What about some of the beverages? Gosh, I'm not

10:53.032 --> 10:54.553
sure. Milk? I'm not sure I remember. I recall 
others. There were words that weren't quite as

11:00.086 --> 11:03.091
cute as some of the others. Beans?

11:06.175 --> 11:08.058
I don't recall that. Everything had a name. If you 
called it by the wrong name, they wouldn't even

11:09.621 --> 11:11.704
pass it to you. They'd ignore you. And as a fish, 
what was your task at the table? Just to serve up the

11:18.514 --> 11:19.535
classroom. You were strictly there just to 
fulfill man's basic needs. Just need to have food,

11:23.620 --> 11:25.503
but that was about it. There was no enjoyment. As 
you look back on it, what general evaluation would

11:26.625 --> 11:32.714
you give the quality of food? Oh, I thought the 
quality of food was good. Yeah, it was, you know, it

11:35.438 --> 11:38.002
was not the health food that we have today. But I 
thought the food was good. We all, nobody ever went

11:40.406 --> 11:44.012
hungry. Let's see, can you describe any of the 
pranks that you freshmen may have played on

11:50.688 --> 11:54.972
anybody? Well, I tell you, we're too afraid to do 
that early. But after we kind of got into the

11:57.894 --> 12:05.101
situation, taking the second semester of our 
freshman year, we started doing pretty wild

11:57.894 --> 12:05.101
things to upperclassmen.

12:06.242 --> 12:07.443
Please describe some of them. Well, one which 
stands in my memory, which will be in my memory to

12:07.463 --> 12:16.871
the day I die, was there was one upperclassman that 
we didn't like, not because he was hard on us, he was

12:07.463 --> 12:16.871
just, he was slovenly. And we didn't like him. So, 
uh, during the Christmas break, my freshman year,

12:19.797 --> 12:28.372
my roommate or my good friend, Jack McCreary, and I 
went over, they were building the Sabre motel. So

12:28.753 --> 12:32.559
on highway six at the time, Jack McCreary came from 
a very wealthy family. He was a little

12:33.721 --> 12:35.905
extraordinary for Aggies. He had a big car, big 
trunk. So we went over there that night. Uh, I think

12:41.255 --> 12:43.098
the statute of limitations has passed. So I think I 
can speak frankly. And we took a lot of the Austin

12:46.173 --> 12:50.657
stone that they were building the Sabre Motel out 
of and put it in this car. And then went over and

12:52.038 --> 12:54.540
bought some water, sand. And we did a real nice 
bricklaying job of the front of his door in the

12:56.002 --> 13:01.607
hall. And I think it was dorm seven. And so when he 
came, and then we put a

13:04.209 --> 13:12.816
big I believe we put a cat in there and gave the cat a 
lot of food. And then bricked it up. And when he came

13:16.649 --> 13:31.952
back from the Christmas holidays, he had a 
beautiful floor-to-ceiling brick wall in front

13:16.649 --> 13:31.952
of his door and a cat who had enjoyed the luxury of an 
unlimited supply of food and no sandbox in his

13:16.649 --> 13:31.952
room. That's probably about the worst thing we 
did. Oh, that's a good one. A good one. And I don't

13:37.280 --> 13:38.783
think to this day ever knew who did it.

13:41.988 --> 13:42.328
Let's see. Take me to class now. How did you... Did 
you all go to class as a group or anything? What did

13:50.403 --> 13:52.425
you wear to class? And what kind of behavior did you 
and your colleagues practice in class? Well, we

13:56.189 --> 13:58.070
were in summer uniform or winter uniform. Summer 
uniform was just khaki. Winter uniform was a

13:59.432 --> 14:07.680
little bit different type. I forgot the material 
right now. And then we sometimes would go in

14:10.342 --> 14:11.544
fatigues. We could go in fatigues when we had laps. 
Of course, I'd be an engineering major. We had a lot

14:14.993 --> 14:15.955
of labs. But you couldn't go in fatigues to class. 
You had to wear fatigues only when there was a lab

14:17.877 --> 14:22.463
involved. Again, I kind of went into a shock. I had 
no engineering or technical background. That's

14:27.449 --> 14:28.411
kind of a sidebar.

14:31.374 --> 14:38.884
When I was a junior or senior in high school and my 
dad was having such a tough time in the cattle

14:31.374 --> 14:38.884
business, I asked a friend of mine's father, about 
engineering because he was a very successful

14:39.404 --> 14:42.068
consulting engineer. So he became kind of my very 
mentor in encouraging me to get into engineering.

14:46.413 --> 14:56.066
And he told me, he said, go to A&M, get an 
engineering degree, and then go to the Army and go

14:46.413 --> 14:56.066
to Corps of Engineers, work as a civilian for their 
training program, and come back to Lubbock and

14:46.413 --> 14:56.066
work for me. I did every one of those signs.

15:02.514 --> 15:07.521
So the engineering, to get into engineering was 
kind of a shock to me. I get a little nostalgic

15:08.362 --> 15:11.527
sometimes when I talk about it, but it's kind of a 
shock. But once I got through the first three or

15:12.689 --> 15:17.436
four weeks, it became pretty easy for me. A fairly 
significant question. Describe the role that

15:21.582 --> 15:28.914
some of the significant teachers, advisors 
played in your development. That's not too much my

15:28.934 --> 15:31.618
freshman year. We had good instructors for 
freshman year, but like any university, probably

15:32.408 --> 15:41.120
you had your younger professors, assistant 
professors coming in and teaching freshmen. As I

15:41.140 --> 15:48.950
went through the teaching process, professors 
certainly made a lasting impression on me. I can

15:49.251 --> 15:50.993
name two or four today. Please do.

15:56.000 --> 16:01.487
Doc Harrington, a hydraulics professor, was 
really extraordinary. Dr. Nederman thought

16:02.530 --> 16:10.663
reinforced concrete, who later became the 
president of the University of Texas at

16:02.530 --> 16:10.663
Arlington. Wendell Nederman. Wendell Nederman. 
Outstanding professor.

16:22.642 --> 16:25.086
Those were the two who I thought was most 
impressive. There's a third one, though, who was

16:25.447 --> 16:28.572
in his senior probably a senior tenure as a full 
professor, well known, named Spencer Buchanan,

16:29.108 --> 16:38.703
who taught me soil mechanics. And again, we didn't 
know the profession at that time. We were

16:41.026 --> 16:41.828
undergraduates. We didn't know the real depth and 
strength of the profession. But it was obvious to

16:45.954 --> 16:48.518
me that he was extraordinary. He had published 
books. He was well known in the profession. It

16:50.541 --> 16:56.871
meant more to me in graduate school than it did as an 
undergraduate, because we just wanted to get out

16:50.541 --> 16:56.871
of school and weren't really sensitive to all the 
world of specialty professions, but Spencer

16:57.458 --> 17:02.323
Buchanan, I would say those three were 
extraordinary. Did you have Alphabet Thompson? I

17:04.205 --> 17:04.585
did not. JGH? Mom Semang? I knew Semang. I did not 
have him. Can you, do you remember any other

17:11.933 --> 17:14.876
faculty nicknames? Oh, good gosh, yes. Please 
share those. Well, Joe Sorrells was my sanitary

17:17.299 --> 17:20.742
engineering professor. We called him Fecal Joe. 
Joe Orr was my surveying professor. We called him

17:24.839 --> 17:25.760
Shaky Joe. We were pretty low class back in those 
days. He had an affliction where his hand shook

17:28.103 --> 17:30.245
quite a bit. In fact, we had Junction as an adjunct. 
We spent about six weeks out there with Shaky Joe.

17:37.072 --> 17:38.293
Oh, we'll want to talk about Junction. Oh, I'll 
tell you a lot about Junction. It was a great part of

17:39.414 --> 17:40.656
my career.

17:43.298 --> 17:49.605
We called Dr. Ned Rivets, because he was an 
instructor and so forth.

17:50.851 --> 17:51.872
Those were the nicknames. We had nicknames for 
most of them, unless they were pretty straight.

17:53.975 --> 17:55.498
For example, Doc Harrington. So lovable. I was 
commanding officer in my outfit in my senior year

17:58.282 --> 18:01.827
and making my faculty advisor. Remember any in 
math or chemistry or biology? No, again, math and

18:07.194 --> 18:11.881
chemistry and physics and thermo were adjuncts to 
my profession. So you didn't really relate to

18:11.901 --> 18:14.104
those professors. That's just something you had 
to do. Double E, thermo. math, for example,

18:17.395 --> 18:21.881
calculus, about as high as we went in this 
engineering in those days. Those are people,

18:22.601 --> 18:24.464
those are just things that we had to endure. I do 
remember my physics professor. It was in 1956. I'm

18:29.330 --> 18:32.013
not even sure I remember his name. He was a 
Hungarian refugee who had just escaped the last

18:32.854 --> 18:38.021
minute from the Hungarian Revolution. A real 
young fellow, a brilliant guy. But I remember our

18:41.585 --> 18:44.028
big complaint was we could hardly understand his 
English. Obviously, he was picking up English,

18:44.108 --> 18:46.691
but he was a great physicist. And what was his I 
don't remember his name. I just remember that he

18:49.205 --> 18:55.274
was the first professor I ever had who I had a hard 
time understanding, which is a kind of

18:49.205 --> 18:55.274
commonplace situation today. But most of my 
non-track courses were just, you just endured it.

19:04.869 --> 19:05.410
You had to do it. I didn't have any trouble in it. To 
whom did you turn for academic advice? Who was your

19:10.959 --> 19:13.002
key counselor advisor?

19:15.766 --> 19:23.535
That's kind of interesting, Haskell, because I 
really didn't seek much academic advice all the

19:15.766 --> 19:23.535
way through school.

19:25.618 --> 19:30.344
The first three or four or five weeks in 
engineering were kind of a shock, but then I could

19:25.618 --> 19:30.344
grasp it pretty easily. And once I got into that 
rhythm, I just really knew where I was going, and I

19:30.384 --> 19:39.635
just didn't really seek much help from any 
academic advisor. It was there. I just didn't seek

19:40.236 --> 19:41.317
it. Now, who was the dean then, dean of 
engineering? I'm going to say John Calhoun. I

19:47.002 --> 19:47.843
think that's correct. John Calhoun, which we 
never saw. I just knew who he was. It's interesting

19:51.669 --> 19:54.974
because I got to know him later in academic life. A 
fellow named Wright was the head of the Civil

19:56.075 --> 19:58.419
Engineering Department. We hardly ever saw him. 
The people who got pretty high up never spent much

19:59.641 --> 20:04.628
time, nor did we seek much time with 
undergraduates. All right, let's go back to

20:05.490 --> 20:07.212
Junction. Tell me all about Junction. Great 
experience.

20:12.331 --> 20:17.418
Junction was an adjunct of A&M, made famous, of 
course, by Mayor Bryant. And it was a kind of Texas

20:17.438 --> 20:22.765
Hill country and a beautiful place. And we went out 
there for six weeks. The geologists and the civil

20:25.468 --> 20:29.013
engineers went to Junction. And when did you go? It 
was in the summertime. And it was a six-week,

20:31.316 --> 20:34.500
pretty intense surveying camp. The geologists 
went out there to look at the subsurface strata and

20:34.520 --> 20:37.424
so forth. We went out there to learn surveying. 
Shakey Joe Orr was our professor. He was the only

20:44.042 --> 20:45.023
professor out there. And it was really a great 
experience. We had a lot of fun because we lived in

20:48.949 --> 20:55.338
these kind of semi-tents and all fell in love with 
Junction Girls. This was in June? This was

20:58.883 --> 21:00.205
probably July. I think they had two semis. Also, 
they had a freshman orientation area. Some

21:03.310 --> 21:04.912
freshmen would go to Junction for orientation. I 
never did. We had freshmen, geologists, of course

21:06.010 --> 21:12.961
when Baird Bryant was there, one football can, but 
I think the Southwest Conference had to rule that

21:06.010 --> 21:12.961
out after he was there. But the footprints were 
there. I mean, we went through the same junction

21:15.905 --> 21:20.352
they went through, except we just didn't have to 
work as hard under Baird. We'd shakey-joke a

21:22.555 --> 21:24.138
little easier than Baird Bryant. But it was just 
great. We had fish on the weekends. We all had

21:27.983 --> 21:28.865
girlfriends. A lot of us had girlfriends in 
junction. All the junction high school boys had

21:30.287 --> 21:34.954
this because when Aggies came in, we just kind of 
took over the... the female stock there. And

21:37.103 --> 21:39.707
where, on a Saturday night, where did y'all go for a 
good time? We'd go country and western dancing. In

21:41.650 --> 21:42.130
Junction? In Junction or some honky-tonk close 
by. I had lots of honky-tonk. How did y'all get back

21:45.555 --> 21:47.237
and forth? Most of us had cars. Most of us had cars. 
This was our junior year. Two of our junior and

21:52.123 --> 21:54.206
senior years, I recall. And so we would go to all 
these little outlying towns, Sonora, Junction,

21:54.226 --> 22:02.497
places like that that was on them. And Of course, 
being a West Texan, I'd put on my boots and my cowboy

22:03.706 --> 22:07.210
hat and stuff, left arm. We'd go out there and 
dance. All right, now, and you did not, the summer

22:08.831 --> 22:13.776
was not in Aggie Corps uniform or Corps. Oh, no. And 
see, this time we had gone through kind of a weeding

22:14.577 --> 22:18.061
out process. We were all, we became more 
civilianized, I guess, as you go through the Corps

22:18.101 --> 22:23.686
and you get through your sophomore year. And we 
were on kind of a degree track, starting to think

22:24.707 --> 22:27.150
about the future. So Junction was just a great 
time. Not going to summer camp, summer boys camp,

22:28.371 --> 22:33.156
except we got six hour or five hour credit course. 
Had a lot of good experiences. It's kind of a side

22:37.130 --> 22:40.153
issue. Shakey Joe had a red pickup. And in 
describing surveying notes, you always, when you

22:44.356 --> 22:54.305
get a certain surveying point and you locate it in 
the coordinates and elevation, you describe it,

22:44.356 --> 22:54.305
describe it so subsequent people can come out and 
find it. And all of a sudden, we put down our notes,

22:54.325 --> 23:03.092
this turning point or this benchmark is located 
4.5 yards away from a red pickup truck. The Shakey

23:03.427 --> 23:04.829
Joe would always come and check on us. Also, we had 
a, shortly after the Korean War, we had a mountain

23:06.371 --> 23:12.460
called Heartbreak Ridge. What you had to do is run a 
string of levels to get the elevation up to the,

23:13.301 --> 23:20.230
you'd go all the way up, and it'd take all day long. 
There's old surveying equipment, so we'd have to

23:21.652 --> 23:25.698
establish the elevation at the top of the 
mountain. And of course, everybody knew what it

23:25.718 --> 23:29.383
was from past classes. So it was pretty easy, and if 
you didn't get within a tenth of a foot, then you had

23:30.545 --> 23:36.231
to run it on Saturday. Well, that would have 
disrupted our dancing and our social plans with

23:36.251 --> 23:43.219
the Junction High School girls, so we all wanted to 
make sure that we got it. Well, to make sure that

23:43.999 --> 23:50.827
nobody cheated, Shakey Joe would take the last 
shot on the rod to the transit to make sure that we

23:43.999 --> 23:50.827
couldn't pencil it in. Not that we would have done 
that, but it was a temptation to do that because we

23:50.867 --> 23:54.831
all knew what the automation was. So he would stay 
up there, he'd crawl up there, leave his red pickup

23:55.874 --> 24:05.726
truck at the bottom of Heartbreak Hill and go up 
there to the top and take the last shot to make sure

23:55.874 --> 24:05.726
that you came in with a 10. 75% of us got it right. I 
see. On Junction, two more questions.

24:11.012 --> 24:13.115
Physically, what was there at the adjunct? They 
had a cafeteria, kind of a mess hall. Really nice.

24:16.739 --> 24:20.063
These were permanent buildings with screens and 
permanent roofs at that time. So there was kind of

24:20.744 --> 24:25.189
cabins which were all wood and screened at the top 
and it wouldn't So that was about it. We had a, I

24:26.871 --> 24:28.934
think we had a swimming pool. There was a, a river 
ran through it and always had water. So it was, it

24:35.522 --> 24:38.145
was not luxurious, but it was adequate. All right. 
And now looking back, evaluate what that

24:38.846 --> 24:44.573
experience was for you as an engineer. We had a lot 
of bonding going on. We had some good friends out

24:45.954 --> 24:47.957
there. We had surveying parties before each. So we 
worked as, and we did a lot of pretty advanced

24:49.358 --> 24:54.805
surveying at that time using that technology. It 
was a great practical experience. In those days,

24:59.285 --> 25:01.968
part of engineering was surveying. And I did a lot 
of surveying in my first part of my professional

25:02.328 --> 25:05.091
career. And probably we had the best surveying 
education of any university in the country at that

25:06.212 --> 25:11.376
time, right? College at that time. So it was a great 
experience. It was a lot of fun. We learned a good

25:17.162 --> 25:18.723
science. We learned to shoot the stars and 
establish true north and all those kind of things.

25:22.026 --> 25:23.087
Shoot polaris is what we called it. So it was a 
big-time deal. I was a little bit saddened when A&M

25:25.556 --> 25:33.884
transferred the country over to Texas Tech, but I 
didn't know any of the details, but it was a great

25:25.556 --> 25:33.884
part of my education. All right, let's go back into 
the routine. What was it like to be a sophomore at

25:36.026 --> 25:40.711
A&M compared to being a freshman? Well, a little 
bit more of a human being. Let your hair grow out.

25:45.395 --> 25:46.396
Start dating girls again. We're getting a little 
bit more confidence in our curriculum. And I was,

25:48.979 --> 25:52.062
again, in a company in a, ROTC unit that was working 
with all technical people, engineers. So we made a

25:55.192 --> 25:57.857
lot of fun at that time. We were only really 
scholars and a whole bunch. Everybody else would

25:59.639 --> 26:01.623
flunk out of engineering and go to business. So we 
called engineering pre-prisoners

26:01.723 --> 26:05.368
administration. That's what we all called it. But 
the engineering curriculum was tough. But we, at

26:11.838 --> 26:15.023
that time, when you're a sophomore, you figure out 
you want to graduate. We could handle it. Corps was

26:16.826 --> 26:18.589
our leisure. It was just more of the, you got to look 
at more of the so-called college life and away from

26:20.037 --> 26:29.389
the more rigid discipline that goes with 
freshman. All right, and when you, what were the

26:29.409 --> 26:36.939
expected, I'll say, rules of classroom behavior? 
How did you expect? Well, there were really no

26:39.482 --> 26:40.543
rules. It was just, no, there was, in my whole 
career at A&M, I don't remember any misbehavior in

26:40.604 --> 26:48.053
the classroom. None, zero. I don't remember any 
rules and guidelines that never entered our mind.

26:52.094 --> 26:54.357
There'd be any classroom behavior situations. 
Did y'all expect to go to class regularly? Oh,

26:56.700 --> 26:57.901
yeah. I mean, we wouldn't get out of school. I mean, 
that wasn't any question, not going to class. One

27:03.929 --> 27:11.259
time we'd cut class, maybe on a Friday afternoon on 
one of our easier courses, and normally the

27:03.929 --> 27:11.259
professor's pretty lean in that regard, but 
cutting class was just unheard of. Do you have any

27:12.881 --> 27:16.386
recollection of how much it cost for your, per 
year? Absolutely, almost to the dollar. Please

27:21.483 --> 27:23.525
describe that. My, virtually all of my classmates 
were not subsidized. There were no scholarships.

27:31.976 --> 27:36.060
There were scholarships available, but very few 
of us won scholarships. I could make enough in the

27:36.080 --> 27:42.108
summertime working as an intern consulting 
engineer for my mentor that I mentioned

27:36.080 --> 27:42.108
previously. I could make about $1,000 a summer. It 
was all saved because I lived at home. I worked in

27:49.348 --> 27:49.989
Lubbock. And it cost me about $1,000 a year. So I 
think I probably got $300 or $400 of help from my

27:54.075 --> 27:56.898
father. But I ended up out of A&M for a total cost of 
about $4,000. I had no debt. And a college degree.

28:06.571 --> 28:07.853
So it was a pretty simple thing. Now, if you didn't 
work in the summer, you'd be subsidized,

28:08.314 --> 28:12.259
obviously. Now, very few students worked. A few 
worked as waiters, and we really respected those

28:14.542 --> 28:16.765
guys. But very few, you couldn't be in the Corps and 
work. You just couldn't do it, unless you were a

28:19.641 --> 28:23.847
waiter.

28:24.267 --> 28:35.142
Activities on the campus, the Y, the MSC, and so 
forth, what were the places where you all went for

28:24.267 --> 28:35.142
extracurricular events? I did not get involved in 
any extracurricular events my freshman year. I

28:39.708 --> 28:40.589
had all I could handle. And I really wasn't 
oriented that way my freshman year. I just wanted

28:44.114 --> 28:44.895
to survive. Sophomore year, a little bit. But 
junior and senior year, I became much more

28:47.508 --> 28:50.912
oriented toward extracurricular events. I was 
very active in SCOMA, Student Council on National

28:50.932 --> 28:54.255
Affairs. We had a lot of fun going to pick up 
students at North Filch on the train coming up all

28:55.657 --> 29:00.802
over the country. MSC, there were some activities 
primarily through the MSC. I did not get involved

29:05.708 --> 29:07.349
with the Y at all. We had what was called the Student 
Chapter of American Society of Civil Engineers,

29:09.712 --> 29:15.338
which I got involved with. But most of us 
volunteers was great experience. So those are

29:22.794 --> 29:25.396
most of the activities in which I became involved. 
We also had a student body of the entity in the Army

29:25.416 --> 29:34.526
called the American Ordnance Association, which 
I spent some time with. Do you remember any famous

29:34.606 --> 29:41.794
visitors or celebrities that you saw or heard? 
Well, let me tell you just kind of a funny story. The

29:44.967 --> 29:46.709
answer is not really. And let me underscore that 
story. I went to the, my wife and I went to the

29:49.173 --> 29:53.880
opening of the Bush Library. We're just about six 
rows from the front. And we saw every living

29:57.545 --> 30:07.319
president, except President Reagan, all living 
first ladies, John Major, Doug Valenza, on and on

29:57.545 --> 30:07.319
and on. And of course, a lot of... Corps members 
were heavily involved in this. So I was talking to

30:10.519 --> 30:15.066
one of the corps members after this was over, and I 
said, I hope you recognize what a historic day this

30:10.519 --> 30:15.066
was. And all these famous people on this campus. I 
said, in my four years at A&M, all I saw was a drunk

30:17.349 --> 30:21.396
ex-county commissioner. And there's a lot of 
truth to that. I'm just making a funny story, but

30:23.619 --> 30:26.463
there's a lot of truth to that. I don't remember any 
really famous people. The only one I recall is

30:29.788 --> 30:31.190
Schooner. We had Hubert Humphrey come down and 
talk to us. And I remember his speakers before and

30:33.754 --> 30:36.799
after him made a lot of fun of him. As you know, he's 
very loquacious. And, in fact, the one after him

30:39.473 --> 30:45.058
said, you know, when Senator Humphrey comes up and 
talks, you don't know what he's going to say. When

30:45.459 --> 30:46.760
he talks, you don't know what he said. And when he 
gets through talking, you forget everything he

30:47.761 --> 30:49.583
said. So they made a lot of fun of him. He was a very, 
actually a very articulate guy. He's about the

30:54.087 --> 31:02.275
only one I remember of any note that in my four 
years, of course, President Eisenhower had been

30:54.087 --> 31:02.275
there before, General Eisenhower. And we had 
probably famous people before and after, but

31:02.295 --> 31:05.498
during my tenure, very few people of 
international note that I recall. Did you have any

31:10.023 --> 31:13.748
interaction, acquaintance with Wayne Stark? Oh, 
certainly. Describe him. Well, Wayne Stark, just

31:15.891 --> 31:22.861
again, one of those men of history. Wayne had a real 
propensity for students and picking out bright

31:22.881 --> 31:31.233
students who he considered to be bright and acting 
as a mentor to bring them along. In fact, it's hard

31:31.253 --> 31:34.597
to talk about Wayne without getting a bit 
emotional. I mean...

31:40.544 --> 31:41.914
I share your feeling about him. I think Wayne was 
right.
