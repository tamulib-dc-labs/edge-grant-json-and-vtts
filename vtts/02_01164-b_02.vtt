WEBVTT

00:05.498 --> 00:13.069
This is going to be your personal opinion, but I'm 
trying to build up a consensus, if there is one, by

00:05.498 --> 00:13.069
adding up personal opinion. What do you think the 
taxpayers and the general public in this country

00:13.089 --> 00:20.159
think of planetary astronomy in particular and 
just astronomy in general? I think the public's

00:20.901 --> 00:23.004
very interested in astronomy. And to the average 
person on the street, planetary astronomy is

00:23.184 --> 00:28.652
probably most of astronomy. I mean, they've heard 
a lot from Sagan, which emphasizes, although not

00:29.233 --> 00:34.881
exclusively, planetary astronomy. And they see 
stuff in the media frequently on sexy things like

00:35.030 --> 00:41.080
black holes, but they don't understand them. On 
the other hand, if you show them a picture of

00:41.100 --> 00:58.168
Jupiter or a satellite of the outer solar system or 
a volcano on Mars, they'll figure out quite

00:41.100 --> 00:58.168
quickly where it was, how that image was obtained, 
and maybe in some cases be able to tell you why

00:41.100 --> 00:58.168
they'd like to see more. So I think, in fact, it's 
extremely important for science in this country

00:58.469 --> 01:06.181
to continue the planetary program with vigor. Do 
you think the public ought to have that view? Sure.

01:09.786 --> 01:10.727
Why not? It doesn't matter. It's close. It's 
easier to touch. You can see Jupiter at night and

01:12.730 --> 01:14.533
recognize it. To point out to your kids that it's 
not just a star, but it's a big, giant, gaseous

01:15.014 --> 01:23.326
world with little planets around it. Why not? 
Here's another two-part question. And your

01:28.692 --> 01:32.015
viewpoint is probably fairly important here. Do 
you think planetary astronomers have done a good

01:32.816 --> 01:37.561
job of selling themselves to the public and 
Congress? And do you think that astronomers as a

01:37.621 --> 01:43.727
whole have done a good job doing that? It's hard to 
answer. The second one I can answer, recently I

01:46.090 --> 01:56.100
think there's been some counter examples or 
examples of negative salesmanship, bickering,

01:56.823 --> 02:06.515
to Congress trying to go pork and anti-pork for 
things like the Gemini project, probably quite

01:56.823 --> 02:06.515
counterproductive. So politicizing future 
projects with NSF and NASA as the funding agency is

02:07.376 --> 02:14.725
probably a bad idea. As far as planetary astronomy 
being successful, well, you'd like to think so. On

02:19.651 --> 02:22.955
the other hand, look at the number of missions 
planned and canceled of late. So in fact, from that

02:23.276 --> 02:25.058
aspect, despite the fact that these things are 
moderately inexpensive compared to manned

02:26.489 --> 02:35.748
exploration of near Earth environment or 
anything else. They aren't getting full funding.

02:37.933 --> 02:41.921
It's just a tough time for space science, I 
suppose. We've both done some optical and some

02:43.805 --> 02:47.653
radio astronomy.

02:51.413 --> 02:58.280
First of all, radio astronomy never had a sneering 
attitude towards planetary work. Now, is this

02:58.300 --> 03:02.825
just because the planets were bright sources that 
could be identified? Or was it because both of them

03:04.427 --> 03:08.891
in the 50s had this pariah status? Well, I'm not 
sure the radio astronomers had pariah status.

03:12.655 --> 03:15.838
They were just regarded as different, because 
their backgrounds weren't as enough. They were

03:15.858 --> 03:21.184
engineers, and they certainly knew how to use 
slide rule. some electronic test equipment.

03:24.520 --> 03:25.421
Soldering iron. It's definitely a soldering iron 
and plenty of solder. I wasn't completely

03:28.605 --> 03:30.167
scorned. I don't know. No, I think they were 
treated differently. They may have been not

03:33.471 --> 03:39.297
mainstream, but I don't think they were 
particularly pariahs. And as far as planetary

03:39.317 --> 03:50.530
astronomy making an impact, as soon as Jupiter was 
just slightly beyond discovered at low frequency

03:39.317 --> 03:50.530
from the first radiation by Franklin and Burke, 
right? Then Venus got detected, I think, in 56 or 57

03:54.625 --> 04:00.514
first. No one believed it quite that fast. With a 
high brightness temperature. And after a little

04:04.100 --> 04:06.584
while, we realized that that wouldn't go away. And 
you had to figure out what the reason was. So that

04:08.768 --> 04:18.323
played a big role around 1960, plus or minus three 
on each side of 1960, in the development of

04:08.768 --> 04:18.323
planetary physics. How come with this future 
planning and tenure plans and all this sort of

04:19.805 --> 04:35.122
stuff, the radio astronomers always seem to have 
their fights and their bloodlettings behind

04:19.805 --> 04:35.122
locked doors and come out with a unified thing, 
whereas the optical people stage public

04:19.805 --> 04:35.122
spectacles? Why does this always continue? I 
mean, I've heard this repeated many times. I don't

04:41.449 --> 04:42.290
know the answer. I mean, it's a sensible part of 
science to disagree on technical details. That's

04:48.857 --> 04:49.558
normal. but you're not supposed to involve 
Congress in it. Which doesn't understand the

04:54.747 --> 04:56.689
technical details in general. Definitely not, 
and probably doesn't care. And once they hear some

04:58.091 --> 05:07.042
argument, they figure, oh, both of these sides are 
quite silly, and let's listen to them for a few

04:58.091 --> 05:07.042
minutes and go on to something more serious. Yeah, 
I don't know the answer to that, but it does seem to

05:08.404 --> 05:10.988
always be the case. I would have thought we'd got 
over that 10 years ago. I mean, even the

05:14.392 --> 05:19.258
high-energy physicists have gotten their act 
together, which with that bunch of, Queen Bee

05:19.829 --> 05:23.854
seems incredible.

05:23.874 --> 05:25.917
Yeah, I don't know how black and white the 
situation is. I'm pretty unplugged to that. But

05:27.118 --> 05:48.064
certainly, ever since I got to think about 
astropolitics, it's always been the case that the

05:27.118 --> 05:48.064
radio astronomers have been well enough prepared 
in advance that they had a chance to get something

05:27.118 --> 05:48.064
while the optical folks bit and scratched, mostly 
scratched each other pretty badly. Now with some

05:48.179 --> 05:58.233
exceptions, I mean the National Observatory in 
the early days at least went quickly from an 0.9 to a

05:48.179 --> 05:58.233
2.1 to 2.4 meter telescopes, but after that it's 
pretty much turned off. Planetary

05:58.253 --> 06:07.806
Astronomies found out a lot of things about the 
solar system in the last 30 years. All you have to do

06:07.866 --> 06:12.853
is compare Baker's 7th edition or something like 
that and it's just a whole different solar system.

06:13.964 --> 06:19.011
Do you think that's really changed the way the 
general public thinks about anything? I've got a

06:19.031 --> 06:23.917
whole list here, the way they've thought about 
Earth, solar system, the universe, planetary

06:19.031 --> 06:23.917
astronomy, astronomy. Can you be more explicit? I 
mean, give me an example. Has it really changed the

06:26.440 --> 06:34.611
way

06:26.440 --> 06:34.611
people think about, well, for example, science? 
Do you think that all these discoveries have made

06:34.631 --> 06:39.798
people say, hey, these scientists can really do 
something. They can really find out stuff. I think

06:41.179 --> 06:43.262
they've thought that that's the case. since World 
War II. I think the application of science to the

06:46.131 --> 07:02.673
conflict, World War II and the Cold War, told 
people that science was important, if not

06:46.131 --> 07:02.673
necessarily completely without 
disqualification or sin. There's been a lot of, I

07:03.074 --> 07:13.468
don't know if you want to call it 
pseudo-philosophical comments to the effect

07:03.074 --> 07:13.468
that now that we can get out and see that Earth is 
just one little planet among others and all this

07:03.074 --> 07:13.468
sort of stuff. Do you think that's really affected 
the general public?

07:19.310 --> 07:24.078
Slightly from the ecological point of view, but 
not enormously. I think the lumber companies are

07:24.859 --> 07:30.889
still quite happy to cut all the old growth and the 
owls be damned.

07:33.914 --> 07:38.562
OK. 30 years ago, there was still a chance that 
there was life on Mars. And now we've been to all the

07:39.942 --> 07:49.131
major planets except Pluto, and no evidence so far 
of any life on any planet, particularly no little

07:39.942 --> 07:49.131
green men on Mars, not even a bug. Do you think 
that's had any effect on funding and public

07:50.032 --> 07:56.418
interest for planetary astronomy, astronomy, 
and science in general? I don't think so. I don't

07:57.259 --> 07:57.859
think so. Anyway, we haven't explored Jupiter 
thoroughly, right? I mean, there's still

08:00.842 --> 08:03.545
possibilities for floaters. The alternative is 
if they would have found one microbe on Mars. We'd

08:08.107 --> 08:10.009
be standing there now probably. That's true. I 
mean, certainly if the results had been very, very

08:10.770 --> 08:22.603
different from Viking's more or less negative 
results, that we'd want to track it down or

08:10.770 --> 08:22.603
certainly make sure it wasn't something we 
carried along. Yep, hitchhikers are welcome.

08:24.926 --> 08:26.628
Yes, I agree with what you're saying. But I don't 
think it's had an enormously negative effect,

08:26.648 --> 08:34.857
because I think most people are slightly cynical 
and didn't really expect to see much. It would have

08:35.562 --> 08:38.027
been interesting if they had found fossils. Hard 
to do experiments on. We don't know that. We still

08:41.273 --> 08:42.375
may. Of course, the only two lander probes were 
landed for engineering reasons. Absolutely.

08:48.367 --> 08:54.018
They're lousy places to look for anything 
interesting because they don't have previous

08:48.367 --> 08:54.018
water flow history. Now, unfortunately, this 
question that I that I wrote down here. It says your

08:59.866 --> 09:04.293
institution, but Lick is now separate from 
Berkeley, but isn't in all the states. Lick is a

09:04.313 --> 09:06.657
statewide institution, per se. It's called 
Organized Research Unit, and it serves all

09:06.677 --> 09:11.143
campuses. Well, then let's just take Berkeley 
here. You mentioned how Carl came here for a while

09:13.948 --> 09:17.473
and got interest started. And you still have some 
interest in planetary astronomy. Do you have any

09:20.898 --> 09:23.582
planetary astronomy group here or anything like 
that? Not really a group, but Imke de Potter is very

09:23.622 --> 09:27.388
interested and works almost full-time on 
planetary problems, radio mostly, radio

09:27.622 --> 09:34.989
magnetospheres, radio thermal radiation from 
all the planets. She's had a student who just

09:35.870 --> 09:42.597
finished a thesis on the thermal radiation from 
Mercury as measured radio interferometry. So

09:43.418 --> 09:44.299
there's a bit going on. Also, the geology 
department would like to be in it. They're not

09:46.661 --> 09:48.423
quite sure how to do that. So there's interest in 
geology, but nothing much yet to show for it. How

09:54.088 --> 09:57.612
come this place never developed a strong 
planetary things. Other things? Just breaks of

10:00.427 --> 10:01.348
the game. A lot of strong people in other fields. 
It's hard to cover every base. We don't have much in

10:06.918 --> 10:08.641
solar. But never any implied attitude that you 
shouldn't do that? No. What do you think the

10:14.290 --> 10:20.781
taxpayers got out of the money they funneled into 
the space program over there? the past 30 years of

10:21.200 --> 10:23.442
planetary astronomy? Oh, a lot. A lot, because 
it's a wonderful frontier. More in planetary,

10:26.065 --> 10:29.669
more tangible stuff in planetary than anything 
else. And we can point to moon rocks and say, hey, if

10:29.689 --> 10:33.753
you're interested, we'll tell you how old that 
rock is. That rock is older than anything you

10:33.813 --> 10:36.817
walked on. Probably. Probably. So, yeah, I think 
they've done reasonably well. I mean, you know,

10:41.322 --> 10:44.425
it's hard to justify the bucks for a launch, but 
what can you do? I think they've gotten a lot of

10:44.445 --> 10:46.948
thrills, too. You think planetary astronomy is a 
real... accepted now by most other astronomers?

10:54.091 --> 10:54.451
Most. Most. Still a few hold out. Maybe. Not that 
many. But, you know, I don't like all kinds of

10:57.814 --> 11:00.477
astronomy. Some of mine knows that, but there's 
some things I wouldn't bother to do. A lot of people

11:03.940 --> 11:09.565
have been getting a lot of mileage lately in the, 
quote, planetary, unquote, field. I just wrote

11:09.746 --> 11:12.368
down four things here. There might be more. One is 
the search for extraterrestrial intelligence.

11:16.672 --> 11:18.574
One is search for other solar systems. Another one 
is the hole in Earth's ozone layer, and one finding

11:19.992 --> 11:29.864
and deflecting killer asteroids and comets. So 
you think they've overdone that? Well, not that

11:33.549 --> 11:35.972
much. I mean, the ozone hole is real, right? So you 
hardly want to see your grandchildren have to wear

11:38.535 --> 11:44.262
a Dodger hat every time they go out in the sun in 20 
years. So that's something that clearly is a

11:45.384 --> 11:49.729
man-made situation, which can be probably 
improved by ecological care in the future. So

11:57.598 --> 11:59.721
that's probably, obviously, the most important 
thing. SETI is the most whimsical, but still has a

12:00.682 --> 12:05.549
small outside chance of success. And there, of 
course, the stakes are very large. So it's like a

12:08.213 --> 12:09.094
lottery. And that would be exciting. And I'd be 
somewhat cynical about the chances for instant

12:11.678 --> 12:16.184
success. But who knows? Killer asteroids? The 
statistics are fairly straightforward that

12:20.692 --> 12:30.501
there are asteroid impacts that are going to 
release a lot of kinetic energy. Certainly going

12:31.262 --> 12:33.344
to ruin the Tuesday tea party. Yeah. Right. So 
that's fine whether you can deflect them or want to

12:35.306 --> 12:40.631
deflect them if you knew enough how to do that. This 
is a different constituency, which might not be my

12:41.432 --> 12:46.817
favorite fans. Other solar systems are... likely 
events, and we don't quite know how to find them.

12:51.066 --> 12:54.810
When you find a dust cloud around Beta Pictoris, 
that's fine. Whether that really has anything to

12:54.850 --> 13:01.336
do with another solar system is unknown, but it's a 
kind of lead we would like to follow up in a variety

12:54.850 --> 13:01.336
of ways. So looking, for example, for objects of 
few Jovian masses by regular velocities of the

13:01.877 --> 13:17.412
apparent star are projects going on now which are 
quite worthwhile and don't tap the resources very

13:01.877 --> 13:17.412
deeply. should continue, and the chances of 
success are hard to measure, but probably pretty

13:17.662 --> 13:24.213
good. Here's a question, and I think you can put 
them together, because both planetary

13:24.233 --> 13:34.990
astronomers and regular astronomers are 
complaining about the budget crunch. But of

13:35.030 --> 13:41.581
course, there's even now vastly more money per 
astronomer available than there was in the late

13:35.030 --> 13:41.581
1950s, right? Yeah, because then there wasn't 
any. We learned to do without. But that wasn't so

13:44.425 --> 13:45.447
good. I mean, use it up, wear it out, make it do. We 
learned that. And that's not necessarily the most

13:49.733 --> 13:52.998
efficient way to proceed. It does make you 
self-reliant. But what do you think about, and

13:54.881 --> 14:03.274
I'll lump together planetary astronomy with 
astronomy, because if somebody pulls the plug in

13:54.881 --> 14:03.274
the bathtub, all the little rubber duckies are 
going to ground.

14:06.358 --> 14:07.500
What's the state of it today? Plateau? Seems like a 
plateau, but the problem is The number of people

14:12.640 --> 14:22.033
who want money are increasing, and expectations 
are increasing sort of proportional to the

14:12.640 --> 14:22.033
prospects in the field, which are good. So it's a 
disappointment in the sense that our

14:23.394 --> 14:27.520
expectations get higher all the time. So the 
exponent is greater than one. Yeah, I think so.

14:31.665 --> 14:40.818
And, well, would you agree that it just can't keep 
increasing at the rate it's been doing, say,

14:31.665 --> 14:40.818
during the 70s or during the 60s? Yeah, there it was 
very high. But it could increase a little bit, keep

14:42.897 --> 14:49.786
us from fighting among ourselves all the time for 
the remaining scraps. There are more

14:49.967 --> 14:55.494
degree-granting institutions than ever, and 
more new PhDs than ever. How long can that go on? Not

14:56.636 --> 14:57.177
forever. We've got more than we need. Right. I 
mean, you just can't employ them all game through.

15:02.624 --> 15:06.369
Also, there's a rather substantial influx of 
astronomers from other fields. So it isn't just

15:06.389 --> 15:10.575
that we're training too many PhDs, but the field is 
successful. The numbers I've heard quoted around

15:10.724 --> 15:17.150
recently is something like 135, roughly, PhDs per 
year in astronomy. And there aren't nearly that

15:18.291 --> 15:22.095
many positions. So they often go into postdocs as a 
holding position for some years. On the other

15:26.038 --> 15:33.245
hand, the number of people calling themselves 
astronomers or becoming members of AAS increases

15:26.038 --> 15:33.245
at about twice that rate. So it must mean an influx 
from physics and other associated fields. So even

15:37.549 --> 15:40.512
if we were to cut back enormously in productivity 
new PhDs, it wouldn't completely solve the

15:40.812 --> 15:47.761
problem.

15:47.781 --> 15:55.430
We forgot to go into some detail about Gerard de 
Bacallure, who was unusual in that he did

15:47.781 --> 15:55.430
planetary and galaxy research. Right. He walked 
both sides of the street in a very unusual way in the

15:56.151 --> 16:02.479
1950s, 60s, and even later. He was a good advocate 
of planetary astronomy. Wrote a good book on Mars,

16:05.703 --> 16:08.507
which was distillation of many observations. Not 
all of them survived, but it was influential. And

16:14.038 --> 16:27.537
he did very good stuff on galaxies, probably was 
one of the leader in statistical work on galaxy

16:14.038 --> 16:27.537
properties from Hubble's death to maybe 1970. 
Quite an impressive guy to be able to do that that

16:28.779 --> 16:31.122
well. So I shouldn't have omitted him earlier, but 
certainly he was a well-respected person that

16:31.783 --> 16:38.713
could do either. Well, we just noticed that when 
you applied for telescope time at McDonald in

16:38.997 --> 16:56.945
early 1963, de Bacalhau wrote you a letter dated 
February 4, 1963, in which he said there's a good

16:38.997 --> 16:56.945
possibility of JPL buying time at McDonald 
Observatory. And he sounded quite favorable on

16:57.746 --> 16:59.689
that. Right. So I'm not sure what happened next. 
Obviously, it never panned out. It was never a

17:03.453 --> 17:04.595
penny spent. He recommends that you send a formal 
application to Dr. W.W. Morgan at Yerkes

17:04.615 --> 17:09.579
Observatory. And then here's the next letter 
saying, in a famous phrase we both remember, a

17:09.840 --> 17:19.569
famous sentence, I regret to have to inform you 
that the observing program for the McDonnell

17:09.840 --> 17:19.569
82-inch is saturated.

17:22.171 --> 17:28.377
And I would have supposed that you would have made 
arrangements through Caltech to obtain

17:22.171 --> 17:28.377
observing time locally. These were very 
frustrating times. It's interesting that Morgan

17:32.724 --> 17:38.371
actually was a nicer guy than I thought at the time. 
So I don't think he was particularly mad at me. It's

17:43.278 --> 17:47.864
interesting that just a year and a half later, 
McDonald completely opened up to planetary work.

17:47.944 --> 17:52.830
Yes, right, but it wasn't because of either of 
those people, although DeVocalor certainly

17:47.944 --> 17:52.830
wouldn't have minded. No, that was Smitty's 
influence, which had an enormous positive change

17:53.331 --> 17:59.359
there.
