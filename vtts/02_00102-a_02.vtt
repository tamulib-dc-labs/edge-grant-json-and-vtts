00:02.967 --> 00:16.825
The library committee and everybody else agreed that the veterinary medicine library would remain separate, but all the other branch libraries would come to the central library, except chemistry would not agree to that.

00:17.716 --> 00:32.056
And finally, I was chairman of the library committee at this point, and Horace Byers, a very world-renowned geoscientist, was our last president of academic affairs.

00:32.116 --> 00:33.578
He had come from the University of Chicago.

00:35.120 --> 00:41.209
And so we had a public library committee hearing on this matter in the old Cushing Library.

00:42.235 --> 01:04.405
And the key point came that night when the then head of the chemistry department stood up and said that they had been hesitant to say this publicly, but that they now believed it was time to give the real reason and to state it bluntly as to why chemistry should remain separate.

01:04.425 --> 01:07.129
And he said something to the effect that

01:08.611 --> 01:12.798
Chemists worked so much harder than anybody in any other discipline.

01:13.700 --> 01:18.408
And their time was so much more valuable than those in other disciplines.

01:18.969 --> 01:28.425
And I remember he particularly said something to the effect, we don't have time to waste walking to the library like you people in the humanities do.

01:29.030 --> 01:30.432
we must have our own.

01:31.193 --> 01:39.406
And at that point, Dr. Byers interrupted and he said, this meeting is adjourned, the chemistry branch library will be closed and we'll move over.

01:41.049 --> 01:45.856
But it was saying that the time of a chemist was more important than the time of anybody else.

01:47.960 --> 01:51.966
There wasn't much

01:51.946 --> 01:56.717
space in the Cushing or Gilchrist Library buildings when you got here?

01:56.757 --> 01:58.200
Weren't they pretty well crowded?

01:58.220 --> 01:59.122
They were pretty crowded.

01:59.182 --> 02:07.581
And talking about the chemists, we had two collections of chem abstracts, one in the chemistry building and one in the library.

02:07.601 --> 02:10.107
And the library paid for both subscriptions.

02:10.964 --> 02:18.294
And so they had their library with the chem abstracts, which was their major source.

02:18.794 --> 02:22.359
But no, we were getting pretty crowded is why they started building.

02:23.321 --> 02:27.286
And when I left to go to graduate school, the fourth floor addition was a deep hole.

02:28.027 --> 02:32.212
And when I came back, they let us walk through and look at it.

02:33.034 --> 02:39.402
And we had never seen any plans or had nobody in the library had any input as to what we needed

02:40.225 --> 02:42.868
or where we were going to put things.

02:43.108 --> 02:51.356
They just let us walk through and look at the facilities, and there were restrooms for men and women on every floor.

02:51.416 --> 02:52.537
This was unusual.

02:54.319 --> 03:06.891
When I came back and they showed us the staff lounge, I looked at it, and I looked at the library, and it was so much bigger than Cushion, and I said, we will be out of this in 10 years.

03:07.512 --> 03:13.159
And everybody looked at me and patted me on the shoulder and said, well, she's kind of losing it.

03:13.219 --> 03:17.684
She's been out of contacts, and we'll be here for a long time.

03:17.985 --> 03:23.331
And in 10 years, we went into the sixth floor addition in 1978.

03:23.391 --> 03:28.357
So it wasn't a hallucination either.

03:28.778 --> 03:30.600
Now, in the old cushion building,

03:30.580 --> 03:33.944
the only restrooms were in the basement.

03:35.025 --> 03:38.328
And there was no staff lounge, as people know, staff lounge now.

03:38.368 --> 03:47.358
The men's room, the men could sit, I don't know where they sat, I think they sat in the kind of a stairwell area for their coffee breaks.

03:48.059 --> 03:51.162
There were like two small rooms in the ladies' room.

03:51.382 --> 03:57.769
One had the stalls and the sink, and the other was a little lounge area that had

03:59.082 --> 04:06.233
two couch things, like two cushioned couches and a chair, and we had a little shelf with a coffee pot on it.

04:07.175 --> 04:09.498
And everybody brought coffee.

04:09.699 --> 04:14.146
I mean, this week you may bring a pound of coffee and sugar and next week somebody else did.

04:14.907 --> 04:22.559
And when the men wanted coffee, they handed their coffee cups in through the door to get their coffee and went to take their break.

04:23.501 --> 04:26.946
Was there, do you remember, was there even a refrigerator?

04:27.753 --> 04:29.118
I don't think we had a refrigerator.

04:29.379 --> 04:31.226
And there certainly wouldn't have been a micro.

04:31.407 --> 04:32.611
I doubt there was a stove.

04:33.073 --> 04:35.301
No, you had a coffee pot.

04:36.064 --> 04:38.573
Where did you and your friends eat lunch?

04:39.059 --> 04:42.184
Well, you could sit outside if you wanted to.

04:42.344 --> 04:46.071
You could sit in the little lounge area and eat.

04:46.792 --> 04:53.423
Some people, if they had a little money in their pockets, they might go over to the MSC and get a sandwich.

04:53.483 --> 05:02.638
Most everybody either brought their lunch or went home for lunch, because a lot of the people that worked in the library were wives of students, and they lived on campus.

05:03.119 --> 05:04.982
Where did Joel park?

05:05.941 --> 05:17.997
I parked, my first parking place is now where the Harrington Education Building was, or in front between the Cushion Building and the Academic Building.

05:18.057 --> 05:18.938
That was all parking.

05:19.158 --> 05:23.924
Were there, were there stick, did, were there parking stickers at first when you got them?

05:23.945 --> 05:25.967
No, we didn't have parking stickers.

05:25.987 --> 05:27.409
We just parked.

05:27.592 --> 05:35.160
But I can't remember, I know when we started paying for parking, they started assigning you particular lots.

05:35.881 --> 05:40.746
And I know as buildings became being built, I parked right outside the library.

05:40.806 --> 05:48.333
Like I said, whether it was for the Harrington building in that parking lot or between Academic Building and Evans.

05:48.934 --> 05:52.738
And then I went out to what they call lot seven, which I think is closer to

05:53.208 --> 05:57.353
not all the way out to Zachary, but out in that area.

05:57.914 --> 06:06.045
Because I remember I was parked there one day, and I went to pick up my car, and a construction crew had backed into it.

06:06.165 --> 06:13.995
And, of course, there was no, I was by the fence, and there was no way of proving that their construction had ripped a hole in the paint in my roof.

06:14.656 --> 06:22.827
And then I also parked in the area, got to move up to where I was parking in front, the chemistry building, and where the fountain is.

06:23.583 --> 06:28.242
Now they have a fountain area there or a plaza there.

06:29.085 --> 06:31.937
That was close to what they called the M.E.

06:31.957 --> 06:32.800
shops.

06:33.404 --> 06:36.048
And I took classes over in that area.

06:36.088 --> 06:38.152
Most of my classes were in the academic building.

06:39.153 --> 06:44.602
And the ladies room in the ME shop was in a storeroom.

06:45.243 --> 06:49.029
And so, or the commode for the ladies was in the storeroom.

06:49.069 --> 06:59.125
So you had to make sure that there was nobody going into the storeroom when you went in because just the shelves were dividing the area.

07:00.168 --> 07:07.259
And Academic Building had one of the few, in the library, those were one of the few buildings that had ladies rooms on campus.

07:09.322 --> 07:18.695
As a junior staff member, did anybody give you any guidelines, any things to be sure and do and to be sure not to do?

07:22.201 --> 07:27.188
I know back in those days that I guess we had a dress code.

07:27.944 --> 07:30.027
which now there's no dress code.

07:30.127 --> 07:31.789
What was it then, you think?

07:31.809 --> 07:36.615
The women wore heels and hoes and dresses.

07:37.897 --> 07:44.365
And I remember when we did, pantsuits first came out, you wore a matched pantsuit.

07:44.405 --> 07:47.910
The top and the bottom of your pants had to match.

07:47.930 --> 07:50.794
You could wear a vest, but it had to come below the hips.

07:52.095 --> 07:55.740
And I remember we were doing some shifting and I was on a shifting crew

07:56.480 --> 08:00.465
And I came in in a pantsuit to do the shifting in the stacks.

08:01.446 --> 08:04.930
And Mrs. Castle said, you need to go home and put on a skirt.

08:06.392 --> 08:16.083
And I said, but Mr. Woodward or Dr. Dyke had said that the ones that were shifting, since they were doing so much bending and stooping, could wear slacks.

08:18.045 --> 08:23.632
But they had to have a matched top, not just a blouse and slack, a pair of pants that you have.

08:23.752 --> 08:24.833
There was no jeans.

08:25.977 --> 08:32.066
And let's see, I'm assuming no one could have any food or drink at their workspace.

08:32.947 --> 08:38.014
I don't remember anybody did because I was in reference and we were out in the public.

08:38.034 --> 08:39.196
So you certainly didn't there.

08:39.216 --> 08:40.217
So we didn't there.

08:40.518 --> 08:42.180
Now I don't know about the technical services.

08:42.320 --> 08:43.762
People are behind the scenes.

08:44.664 --> 08:49.471
In those early years, do you remember any pranks or jokes that happened in or around the library?

08:50.192 --> 08:52.575
Students or anybody else?

08:53.163 --> 09:00.763
Oh, I remember we had, we've always had our people that do things for attention.

09:01.846 --> 09:07.240
I remember we had the flashers when that was a popular

09:08.958 --> 09:27.271
revolt of students or whatever where the guys would come through and maybe they were standing on the third floor balcony in the library with a raincoat on and he had opened it up and that's all he had on and before you could get to him he could always get back into the stacks and get clothes on or disappear.

09:28.192 --> 09:30.797
We had in the

09:30.777 --> 09:36.128
Evans Building, we had the famous toe-biter, and that made national news.

09:36.629 --> 09:37.691
Describe that.

09:37.711 --> 09:44.885
Okay, the girls, it was always the girls, well, it wasn't always the girls, but we had one girl that caught him.

09:45.847 --> 09:50.035
He'd be studying in a study carol, and if you kicked your shoes off,

09:50.369 --> 10:01.686
all of a sudden you came up with a bloody toe and there was a guy that would crawl under the desk and he would actually, it was always the big toe, but he was always getting.

10:02.468 --> 10:07.055
And sometimes he would use a pair of pliers, but most of them would just bite them.

10:07.075 --> 10:17.811
And there was one girl that caught him and she brought him downstairs and she had a pretty good lock on his ear twisting it and he,

10:19.124 --> 10:25.714
He didn't particularly care to be caught by her because she was twisting his ear pretty hard.

10:25.734 --> 10:26.315
Was this a student?

10:26.956 --> 10:29.239
Yes, it was a student coming around.

10:29.419 --> 10:30.661
Do you remember what happened to him?

10:31.322 --> 10:41.678
Of course, he got loose and plunged, and I think he was out for a while and had some counseling and all like that, but it did make the news.

10:42.159 --> 10:43.821
What about any other jokes you remember?

10:46.645 --> 10:48.388
Was there ever mischief on the...

10:48.908 --> 10:52.933
library materials ever relocated?

10:52.953 --> 10:57.339
Oh, that was, we always had locate cards, because I did the locate cards.

10:57.379 --> 11:01.485
When you couldn't find a book, you'd fill out a little card to ask where the books were.

11:01.545 --> 11:16.024
And I know a lot of times you had to, you kind of knew where the books were thick or thin, because the thin books, they would kind of shove back and let the other books cover so they could come back to them.

11:17.346 --> 11:17.987
Or they would

11:18.322 --> 11:45.983
take a pin over the call number and a H call number could be transformed into a B call number just by the use of a pin until we got the the sailing system which you had the plastic overlay which you couldn't do it and if a book was missing you'd say okay now what is another call number similar like the B's to go to the H's that you would find them hidden and a lot of times when the students would

11:45.963 --> 11:54.518
write down the information for you to look where it said call number, they would put something like 846-0831.

11:56.021 --> 12:02.533
Well 846 is a literature call number, that is a call number in the literature, but it's also a telephone number.

12:03.374 --> 12:10.367
So call number to them to some meant a telephone number and others meant the call number on the book.

12:10.837 --> 12:22.087
So you always had, if it was, you'd look at the title and you'd look at the call number they wrote down to see was this a telephone number they were writing down or was it actually the call number of the book.

12:22.808 --> 12:27.612
Did, were there any incidents of where someone apparently spent the night in the library?

12:28.313 --> 12:38.042
We probably had people spending the nights in the, in the old stacks because there were like eight stack levels in the Cushing Building and four, and three floors and then

12:38.292 --> 12:42.857
When they added on, they had four floors and the stacks didn't mesh up except for the second floor.

12:43.938 --> 12:51.326
I know, I believe it was in 68 when a lot of the rioting, racial riots were going on.

12:52.147 --> 13:02.258
There weren't that many black, Afro-American, which name is currently politically correct now, on campus.

13:02.930 --> 13:05.098
And they demonstrated here on campus.

13:05.199 --> 13:12.788
And what they did, they said there's nothing in the library that reflects our heritage, our culture, there's nothing in the books

13:13.527 --> 13:15.671
And I was on duty the night they did.

13:15.691 --> 13:24.846
They came in and went to the collection in the E-collection, which has the Negro history and all, and checked everything out.

13:25.607 --> 13:35.383
Every book that they could find that dealt with Africa, the blacks, or any area like that, went to the circulation desk and checked them out.

13:35.752 --> 13:38.295
Then they turned around and turned them in.

13:38.976 --> 13:45.503
And this kind of bogged down circulation because we had just started being automated and a lot of this was done by hand.

13:45.563 --> 13:52.290
So you had book truck after book truck, several thousand books checked out and turned in almost immediately.

13:52.570 --> 13:55.534
Of course, you had to go through and they sorted the books.

13:56.875 --> 14:03.362
Things checked out every day was done in a batch mode of cards and they were done at night.

14:03.680 --> 14:18.387
for the next day, so they couldn't discharge them until the next day, so they were just stacked up in the, and the students weren't doing any malicious tearing up of stuff or defacing property.

14:18.407 --> 14:25.400
They just very quietly came in and checked them out and then sat down in the lobby to see if somebody would say something to them about doing this.

14:25.420 --> 14:26.582
Nobody said anything.

14:26.663 --> 14:28.746
As far as you know, were these A&M students?

14:28.766 --> 14:29.808
They were A&M students.

14:30.088 --> 14:32.532
And there was no white opposition to what they were doing?

14:32.552 --> 14:35.236
There were no white students stopping them or anything?

14:35.256 --> 14:35.736
No.

14:35.756 --> 14:36.678
They just let them do it.

14:37.339 --> 14:44.749
Their revolt, some of the agitators, it didn't, it fizzled because they didn't.

14:44.769 --> 14:47.914
They just said, well, let them do it and they didn't get in trouble.

14:48.054 --> 14:55.405
But I know that for several years, I was charged with going to the cataloging department

14:55.655 --> 15:06.887
and doing a bibliography with every book that came in that had a subject heading of black or Africa or anything related, and produced this for about three years.

15:07.027 --> 15:15.857
And it went to one of the deans to show them, yes, we were buying materials, but they didn't have a valid complaint about nothing and being in the library.

15:16.598 --> 15:20.422
And I probably still have copies of those bibliographies somewhere in my files.

15:21.102 --> 15:23.285
During that era, Earl Rudder was the president.

15:23.305 --> 15:25.307
Did you librarians see him much?

15:25.810 --> 15:28.537
He would come in, his dog came in a lot.

15:28.557 --> 15:28.938
Ranger.

15:29.098 --> 15:38.742
Ranger came in, and Ranger and Miss Revly Mam were the only dogs or only animals allowed in the library or in any other building.

15:39.584 --> 15:41.288
Were either of them ever a problem?

15:41.420 --> 15:42.281
Never a problem.

15:43.082 --> 15:47.569
And I think there's more security with Ms.

15:47.609 --> 15:49.311
Reveley, ma'am, now than it was then.

15:49.351 --> 15:52.315
But I know those two kind of roamed the campus.

15:53.217 --> 15:56.782
And if they wanted to sit on something, that was fine.

15:57.122 --> 15:59.425
If they wanted to lie down, you didn't disturb them.

16:00.326 --> 16:02.690
They'd lie down under the... And they were very well behaved.

16:04.112 --> 16:06.415
Better behaved than a lot of the students are today.

16:06.918 --> 16:13.655
In that era, was there anybody in the central administration that library folks thought was a key ally of the library?

16:16.522 --> 16:17.604
Yes, I cannot remember.

16:17.644 --> 16:22.817
And there was one man that was notorious because when he, I cannot remember what his name was.

16:24.485 --> 16:41.571
He would leave that Koch building, which was where most of the material was, and his secretary would get on the phone and call us in the library and say, Dr. So-and-so is on the way to the library, because when he came in, he wanted something yesterday, and he would call.

16:42.292 --> 16:43.594
What was his specialty?

16:43.634 --> 16:44.135
Do you remember?

16:44.595 --> 16:46.478
I can't remember that.

16:47.440 --> 16:50.925
Because this wouldn't have been Wayne Hall, Vice President of Academic Affairs.

16:50.965 --> 16:51.265
No.

16:51.946 --> 16:53.749
Bill Graff, Engineering.

16:54.050 --> 16:57.455
Now, I wouldn't say his name starts with a P, but I can't remember.

16:57.736 --> 16:58.417
I can't remember.

17:00.660 --> 17:05.909
I've been trying to think of his name lately because I was just thinking of some of the ones.

17:05.949 --> 17:08.393
And then we had Dr. Perry.

17:08.873 --> 17:12.699
He's a more current person that was an advocate.

17:12.840 --> 17:14.462
You're talking about Bill Perry?

17:14.783 --> 17:15.003
Bill Perry.

17:15.023 --> 17:15.604
Oh, yeah.

17:15.844 --> 17:16.145
Good guy.

17:16.165 --> 17:16.345
Good guy.

17:17.303 --> 17:20.487
And several others have been our friends.

17:21.168 --> 17:36.209
I do remember when we first started, when Dr. Rudder, when he started trying to build things, and he would go to the board about starting the programs.

17:36.369 --> 17:37.791
He said, yeah, we can start a doctoral program.

17:37.811 --> 17:40.275
We might not have anything at all in the collection.

17:40.295 --> 17:41.877
We have to go out and buy collections.

17:43.173 --> 17:45.522
It did that.

17:45.682 --> 17:51.985
Other friends of the library, allies that you all

17:53.753 --> 18:11.674
We always had a friend in Mr. Evans and he let us know that he had willed us or given us the Little Eva Plantation in Louisiana for funds for a Jim, let's see, Jeff Dykes collection, Western.

18:11.855 --> 18:12.355
Jeff Dykes.

18:12.375 --> 18:12.976
Jeff Dykes.

18:13.597 --> 18:23.068
He was a friend and helped start our Special Collections area in the Western Livestock Industry.

18:23.740 --> 18:26.084
Another note for the typist.

18:27.046 --> 18:46.018
The Little Eva Plantation was acquired by Mr. Evans 40 years ago or so, and he gave it to Texas A&M some years later, and at about that time I became

18:47.078 --> 18:57.249
a part of the administration and the library as dean of faculties, the library was one of my special concerns.

18:57.369 --> 19:01.473
It did not report directly to me, but most library matters went across my desk.

19:02.915 --> 19:06.138
And I was to watch over the Little Eva Plantation.

19:06.218 --> 19:12.985
And one of my great worries was that because of the almost sacred

19:13.994 --> 19:21.443
nature of the Little Eva Plantation being part of the scene of part of the events in Uncle Tom's cabin.

19:22.524 --> 19:32.215
Little Eva being one of the characters of Little Eva in Uncle Tom's cabin being buried, I believe, on the plantation there, the person who was the subject for it.

19:32.796 --> 19:41.065
It was always my worry that there would be some kind of racist event there and that A&M would catch a burden of blame.

19:41.635 --> 20:03.366
so that I was very, very grateful when Mr. Evans eventually made arrangements with A&M that he would take Little Eva back and give us far more in value and property in Texas in exchange for it because I always worried about Little Eva being a difficult one for A&M to deal with.

20:03.406 --> 20:09.415
One of my worries was that if Mr. Evans had died at that time,

20:09.395 --> 20:23.014
And then if A&M put the plantation on the market, would the politically correct observers accuse A&M of not treating the property appropriately and so forth?

20:23.755 --> 20:24.136
Let's see.

20:26.018 --> 20:38.676
As the library began to grow in the late 60s and early 70s, Mr. Rudder died, President Rudder died in early 1970 and Jack Williams became president.

20:38.656 --> 20:41.039
November the 1st, 1970.

20:41.280 --> 20:44.244
Did you all see much of President Williams?

20:45.245 --> 20:52.194
Dr. Williams was an advocate of the library, and he really wanted to build the humanities and social science area.

20:52.996 --> 21:05.052
And he spent time and effort in trying to build that part of the collection, where in the past it had been specifically agricultural, mechanical, engineering.

21:05.555 --> 21:13.884
And I know Dr. Rutter had started trying to the change of times when women started coming on campus.

21:15.025 --> 21:26.557
He had a battle with that with former students and current students and everyone in this that it was going away from the all-military school.

21:27.918 --> 21:35.106
And Dr. Rutter would say, yes, we could have this program, but we wouldn't have it, not check the library holdings.

21:35.508 --> 21:37.211
and we would be playing catch-up.

21:38.212 --> 21:40.616
And now we've got some good collections.

21:41.337 --> 22:01.988
Our nautical archaeology program was one of the ones that he wanted us in that program, and we had to go out and buy a collection to meet that, but our nautical archaeology program is noted worldwide now, and that was one of the ones that he wanted to help build the image of the university.

22:02.052 --> 22:04.976
After Dr. Williams got here, did you all see him in the library?

22:05.076 --> 22:08.600
He'd come into the library, and he would, he knew.

22:09.682 --> 22:19.995
We were lucky, and a lot of the administrators on campus used the library, and they knew us by name and by face.

22:20.055 --> 22:23.740
Who would be notable as fitting that description?

22:23.720 --> 22:25.542
Well, Dr. Williams came in.

22:25.862 --> 22:27.224
Bill Perry came in.

22:27.284 --> 22:39.698
Those are the ones that, and Dr. Perry's still here, and I don't care where I see him, you know, and I'm one of, I don't know how many hundreds that are on campus now, but he calls me by name.

22:39.718 --> 22:43.682
He says Lynn rather than knowing I'm just at the library.

22:45.424 --> 22:48.748
Dr. What about Calhoun?

22:49.117 --> 22:50.879
Dr. Calhoun came in, son.

22:50.979 --> 22:57.006
He was, he was a little more reserved, I think, than some of the others.

22:57.246 --> 22:59.949
But then that's probably his personality.

23:00.470 --> 23:00.950
Vandiver?

23:01.231 --> 23:02.652
Vandiver was here a lot.

23:02.672 --> 23:04.094
Dr. Vandiver was here a lot.

23:04.154 --> 23:10.721
And he would come in, especially at night, to see what the students were doing, how the library was being used.

23:10.762 --> 23:12.964
And he was using the library, too.

23:13.282 --> 23:17.227
And he was using it and not expecting us.

23:17.447 --> 23:26.618
He was one of the, we had some people that came in and they said, I want, and they wanted it presented to them on a quote, silver platter.

23:27.098 --> 23:32.064
But Dr. Vandiver was one of the ones that was actually digging into the materials to find the material.

23:32.484 --> 23:34.447
Clint Phillips came in a lot too.

23:35.648 --> 23:38.091
And he used it, and he was a friend of the library too.

23:38.864 --> 23:42.830
Another note to the typist.

23:43.671 --> 23:52.864
I was chairman of the library committee when one of the first additions to the Cushing Library was being planned.

23:54.647 --> 24:02.719
And as the library committee reviewed the plans, we noticed that there were no study carrels, particularly Coe's carrels, in the original plan.

24:04.221 --> 24:06.424
And so I hurried to Mr. Rutter's office

24:07.417 --> 24:18.490
and gave him a long and I had hoped well prepared explanation of why the carrels were a necessity and we had to have them and just couldn't have a library without them.

24:19.131 --> 24:24.698
And finally Mr. Rudder looked at me and smiled and he said, first of all, you've got to explain to me what in the hell a carrel is.

24:26.059 --> 24:28.002
He didn't know and I did.

24:28.863 --> 24:30.304
And he said, oh, okay.

24:31.125 --> 24:34.970
And he said, the design architect for this project is here in the building.

24:35.010 --> 24:35.871
I'll call him in.

24:36.796 --> 24:47.297
Well, he called the architect in and told him that what I had been there to talk about and that he, President Rudder, wanted carrels added.

24:47.317 --> 24:53.269
The architect told him that the plans were already finished, it was too late, they could not be modified.

24:54.447 --> 25:06.531
Mr. Rudder glanced at me and gave me a wink out of one side of his eye where the architect could not see and then turned to the architect and very firmly said, well, I guess we'll just have to hire us a different architect then.

25:07.793 --> 25:12.422
Suddenly, the design architect realized that he could change the plans after all.

25:12.402 --> 25:17.447
And so we got some carols designed in there.

25:17.948 --> 25:24.054
What was it like for those of you on the staff as these physical additions were being made?

25:24.535 --> 25:29.180
What kind of problems did that cause for you all, the shifting and the moving?

25:30.241 --> 25:35.206
We, the libraries, people in the library were the ones that were doing all the moving of the books.

25:36.047 --> 25:38.950
And sometimes we'd get a little extra student help.

25:39.115 --> 25:43.082
But I know I shifted many, many a book.

25:43.824 --> 25:54.343
And it's kind of heavy when you're shifting some of the oversized books and you're less than five feet tall and you're working with somebody six feet tall and you're shifting the books that can work you down pretty good.

25:55.024 --> 25:56.847
And it's far about these carols.

25:57.068 --> 26:00.614
They were open to graduate students and professors.

26:01.376 --> 26:03.199
And at first they said,

26:03.466 --> 26:06.169
a year at a time, then it was down to a semester.

26:06.889 --> 26:10.333
And the graduate students had to be writing or defending their dissertations.

26:11.274 --> 26:16.879
And usually, they were such popular that they could, there would be two assigned at a time.

26:17.800 --> 26:24.626
And a few of the professors were a little disgruntled because they were going to get, use them as a hideaway office.

26:25.848 --> 26:29.952
But we said, no, you cannot use it as a hideaway office.

26:29.972 --> 26:32.494
You have to be using the materials.

26:33.217 --> 26:43.532
and they still have them assigned with a key, and we reserved the right to go in and check to make sure that books were checked out that were in there.

26:43.552 --> 26:57.992
During this tenure, professors could check out journals, and you'd go to someone's office and there would be half of your journal collection on their shelves while they were using it, but you'd look at them and the dust would be

26:58.293 --> 27:07.467
very thick and we had to start calling in the journals because of the high use, the use of the library was going on.

27:08.028 --> 27:12.415
We always had people in what we call now instructional service program.

27:12.435 --> 27:15.679
Dr. Costa was one of the English ones that came over.

27:15.740 --> 27:16.701
Richard Costa.

27:16.741 --> 27:17.963
Richard Costa.

27:18.023 --> 27:18.664
C-O-S-T-A.

27:18.830 --> 27:33.852
And I remember I was always telling them how to use biological abstracts, and my background was not in the sciences, but we would have a corner of the old reference room in the Cushing Building, which we used to

27:33.832 --> 27:36.336
to give our presentations to the classes.

27:39.100 --> 27:41.865
Like I said, students seem to be using them more.

27:41.885 --> 27:55.266
You would see them more studying, but then they had a, the reference area had the big tables that they were using now where there's more individual carols throughout the building than we had at the beginning.

27:55.651 --> 28:04.604
Do you remember some examples of outlandish requests that someone made of a reference librarian, something that was completely?

28:07.027 --> 28:13.356
I know I did, and I don't know what happened to the bibliography or the history of barbed wire for somebody that was doing a book.

28:14.332 --> 28:24.281
And I worked on, for the extension people, the Green Bug Project for some professor, extension agent in, I think it was in Amarillo.

28:24.961 --> 28:27.323
And he published several publications for that.

28:27.443 --> 28:34.249
I worked with Richard Waters in the, I don't remember one of these, was Dr. Waters in history or sociology?

28:34.269 --> 28:40.775
I can't remember what department he was in, but we had quite a bit on the Chicanos and African-American.

28:40.795 --> 28:44.338
These are some of the early studies that now we're having programs in.

28:44.318 --> 28:54.237
And it seemed like we'd always have someone start a program then and it was kind of, well, why are you doing that interest?

28:54.597 --> 29:02.833
But now it's a common program that is a noted program at the university or is a trend.

29:03.337 --> 29:07.049
nationwide such as our multicultural studies.

29:07.149 --> 29:12.346
I started ordering stuff in that before they ever decided to have a multicultural program.

29:12.727 --> 29:15.034
I started ordering children's literature

29:15.065 --> 29:18.090
And back in those days, you did not order children's literature.

29:18.170 --> 29:20.093
You did not order sports material.

29:20.794 --> 29:22.056
Sports were for fun.

29:22.096 --> 29:32.513
Now you have a program on tourism and parks and recreation and teaching of sports, how to teach sports as well as to play baseball for fun.

29:32.533 --> 29:34.035
You had how to teach it.

29:34.015 --> 29:38.986
And we have a good education program in the kinesiology where they're using these.

29:39.968 --> 29:45.600
The books for children's literature, they were used in the education department, but you didn't have kiddie literature books.

29:45.660 --> 29:53.678
This wasn't something that you used at a university, not stopping to think that this was something that you had to have to teach.

29:53.658 --> 29:57.183
in the school system, but we're building that now.

29:57.543 --> 30:07.155
And I'm guessing that when you began, the strength of the collections in the Cushing Library were primarily in agriculture, engineering, and the sciences.

30:07.396 --> 30:08.157
Right.

30:08.177 --> 30:09.599
But we began to really.

30:09.619 --> 30:10.820
Branch out.

30:10.840 --> 30:11.641
To move along.

30:14.485 --> 30:20.813
Who was the librarian, who was director of the libraries in the 70s?

30:21.755 --> 30:23.038
Dr. Dyke.

30:23.519 --> 30:23.739
Yeah.

30:24.240 --> 30:24.761
Jim Dyke.

30:24.841 --> 30:25.322
Jim Dyke.

30:26.024 --> 30:29.471
Describe him and his manner and style of leadership.

30:30.774 --> 30:36.085
I think he had, he brought into it, he was very professional.

30:37.246 --> 30:49.963
And one thing he did is make an announcement and he said, I think our librarians and our people that are especially in the public service area, they need to, you know, look professional, dress professional.

30:50.544 --> 30:57.693
And if a man needs to get a haircut, he can take the time out and he will not have to make up the time to go get a haircut.

30:57.713 --> 31:02.680
And a woman could go to the beauty shop because she's presenting an image for the university.

31:03.672 --> 31:11.322
So you had release time, which now you do it after hours on your lunch hour or something like this.

31:11.343 --> 31:13.606
And I think the people appreciate it.

31:13.626 --> 31:14.467
They didn't abuse it.

31:15.408 --> 31:16.309
They appreciate it.

31:16.550 --> 31:22.638
And I think we looked better in our demeanor to the public.

31:22.698 --> 31:24.040
I was the chairman of the library committee.

31:24.180 --> 31:29.207
I first interviewed him, I think at Emory maybe.
