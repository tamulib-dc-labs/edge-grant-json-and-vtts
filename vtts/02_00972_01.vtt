00:02.647 --> 00:16.650
This is an interview with Colonel Herbert L. 
Curry, United States Marine Corps, by Brian W.

00:02.647 --> 00:16.650
Icarus on April 29, 1989, at the Trigon Building, 
Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas,

00:02.647 --> 00:16.650
concerning the Vietnam War. In the interest of 
accumulating knowledge about the war, I am going

00:17.332 --> 00:25.986
to donate this tape to Texas A&M Oral History 
Collection in the University Archives. Is that

00:26.006 --> 00:27.028
all right with you, sir? Yes, sir. Sir, you had 
previously stated in the interview given by James

00:29.849 --> 00:44.986
W. Hodges, Jr. on November 29, 1988, that your 
first experience in Vietnam in 1963 was with the

00:29.849 --> 00:44.986
3rd Recon Battalion and the underwater 
demolition teams of the Navy. It has been stated by

00:45.687 --> 00:53.676
other sources that during these years, even the 
special warfare units had difficulties

00:45.687 --> 00:53.676
performing. Would you please expand on that, sir? 
Yes, I will. First,

00:59.566 --> 01:13.046
under the conditions that I was operating, we 
didn't have difficulties before me, at least not

00:59.566 --> 01:13.046
difficulties with the South Vietnamese. We 
operated from the board ship on a daily basis. The

01:18.014 --> 01:28.189
underwater demolition folks conducted 
hydrographic surveys from the high water mark of

01:18.014 --> 01:28.189
the beach out to the sea. or possible landing sites 
or landing beaches my platoon and i conducted

01:28.625 --> 01:56.083
reconnaissance from the high water mark of the 
beach up to 10 miles inward we would go in select

01:28.625 --> 01:56.083
routes of egress determine trafficability away 
from the beach select terrain objectives recon

01:28.625 --> 01:56.083
towns villages airfields any type of military 
that was placed in that area. The only difficulty

02:01.351 --> 02:08.882
that we encountered was that there would be 
Vietnamese in the area, Vietnamese military in

02:01.351 --> 02:08.882
the area. They were unaware that we were operating 
in there at the same time. There was not a

02:13.409 --> 02:18.797
communications set up between the ship that I was 
operating from and the local Vietnamese military

02:19.621 --> 02:22.504
forces ashore. So we were operating 
independently, and sometimes we would have a

02:23.025 --> 02:34.036
chance meeting with Vietnamese, and they weren't 
aware that we were in the area. On one occasion, I

02:34.056 --> 02:48.632
was on a road about five or six miles inland, and 
coming around at the end was a military jeep with an

02:34.056 --> 02:48.632
army Vietnamese captain. stopped and said, hey, 
we've got a big battle going on just around the

02:49.068 --> 02:54.357
curve and over that hill. And we had no knowledge of 
that, so we had no intelligence.

03:00.007 --> 03:07.359
And Vietnam was in a war at that time, and yet the US 
forces were in there operating. So did I have

03:07.379 --> 03:08.642
trouble operating? No, I didn't, because I was 
operating from sea on a daily basis. My logistical

03:15.798 --> 03:17.920
support was there. We were well taken care of. But 
as far as any interface with the Vietnamese, we

03:19.802 --> 03:33.175
didn't have that, nor did we have any intelligence 
being given to us about what the area was like or was

03:19.802 --> 03:33.175
there any enemy forces in the area at that time. I 
understand it's not the recon's mission to engage

03:33.195 --> 03:42.565
the enemy, but were there such encounters? Yes. We 
had a couple of encounters. One time we were in the

03:47.714 --> 04:03.074
Marble Mountain area, and we received some 
gunfire,

03:47.714 --> 04:03.074
and we immediately departed the area, got back to 
our rubber boats, and went out to sea. Another time

04:03.094 --> 04:10.543
we were in the Mekong Delta area, south of Vung Tau,

04:13.325 --> 04:17.330
Half of my platoon got pinned down for an excess of a 
day. We were drawn from the mangrove swamps. We

04:20.834 --> 04:32.890
were on the beach, and the tide was out, and the 
tidal flap was such, or the tidal range was such, or

04:20.834 --> 04:32.890
the beach gradient was such that we couldn't get 
boats in to evacuate the people. So we had to remain

04:32.910 --> 04:40.039
undercover throughout the day until the tide came 
in and we could evacuate the people. Yes, it was our

04:40.059 --> 04:42.842
mission not to engage We were strictly to have

04:43.092 --> 04:48.057
thousands of them. Sir, what were the basic 
differences between activities while you were a

04:48.077 --> 04:56.966
platoon commander of a recon unit and a company 
commander of an infantry unit? Which benefited

04:58.047 --> 05:00.329
you the most in dealing with the war?

05:05.374 --> 05:11.580
Well, I can't say that one benefited me more than 
the other. Because I had been in Vietnam as a second

05:12.353 --> 05:17.922
lieutenant, I knew something about the people. I 
knew what the country and the planet were like. And

05:20.586 --> 05:25.393
that gave me some first-hand knowledge on how to 
operate there. I came back several years later as a

05:25.413 --> 05:30.180
captain and a company commander. I had more 
experience at that time. Plus, I'd gone through

05:34.146 --> 05:39.154
three weeks of specialized Marine Corps training 
at Camp Hillary, California. which was to prepare

05:39.539 --> 05:42.943
people to go into Vietnam. We had courses on, 
classes on the culture of the people, the do's and

05:44.304 --> 05:57.318
don'ts, and how to react with people, because we 
were over there to win the hearts and minds, as well

05:44.304 --> 05:57.318
as to win military. We also had infiltration 
courses, courses that trained us in detecting and

05:57.338 --> 06:05.327
avoiding moving traps and mines.

06:09.982 --> 06:13.527
So I felt that I was pretty well-prepared when I 
went to Vietnam. Still, there is nothing like

06:13.547 --> 06:19.556
on-the-job experience in combat whenever you get 
over that. Nothing truly compares you for

06:19.717 --> 06:22.841
everything in combat. So when you're asking for a 
comparison between being a company commander in

06:23.803 --> 06:36.782
combat and being a platoon commander with 
reconnaissance equipment as a second

06:23.803 --> 06:36.782
lieutenant, there is no comparison. All right, so 
I guess that will kind of lead into my next question

06:37.758 --> 06:40.842
now. On your return to Vietnam in 1968, what were 
the noticeable differences then and your first

06:41.723 --> 06:51.795
experience in 1963? In 1963,

06:51.815 --> 06:57.402
I had gone in. One of the missions had gone in to the 
Bay Airfield. or the military air base there in the

07:02.969 --> 07:12.504
northern

07:02.969 --> 07:12.504
portion of South Vietnam. It was basically a 
sleepy village, oriental village. The airfield,

07:19.875 --> 07:28.369
although there was a war going on, was fairly 
enacted by the U.S.

07:28.389 --> 07:29.871
I was amazed when I flew in. in 1968, January of 
1968. As I recall, there had been another airstrip

07:35.539 --> 07:49.391
prepared parallel to

07:35.539 --> 07:49.391
the original airstrip.

07:49.411 --> 07:56.237
It was an air base in the city of Busting Rock City.

07:56.257 --> 07:59.740
I was really, I was amazed what America could do 
when it was mobilized

08:00.631 --> 08:12.661
and eventually made. We had rocket crushers, 
postal services, clubs, exchanges, large

08:12.681 --> 08:19.267
organizations, lots of jets flying in and out, 
coming in on those runways. The transformation

08:19.287 --> 08:23.270
was like day in, night out. Is there any different 
from what it was like in 1963, as in that you were

08:31.124 --> 08:32.486
located down in them. But I guess the real question 
I'm asking is the attitude in the people and, I

08:33.347 --> 08:43.079
guess, the change in the war atmosphere.

08:44.881 --> 08:53.331
I didn't have that much contact with the people in 
1968 and 1969. When I was there in 1963, the

08:53.351 --> 08:59.899
people still lived throughout the countryside. 
because the war was not at the intensity that it was

09:00.824 --> 09:07.071
in 68 and 69. But when I got there in 68, I found that 
we still had Vietnamese living in the name, and

09:07.091 --> 09:23.028
they were allowed to travel Route 1, but there were 
checkpoints that controlled their travel, and

09:07.091 --> 09:23.028
they all actively seized at nighttime. Around the 
name, people still lived in villages But we had had

09:29.140 --> 09:32.683
what we called the CAP program at that time. That 
was Combined Action. But we took a squad of Marines

09:34.325 --> 09:40.391
and had them living at each village to train them in 
self-defense. The people would work their bills

09:41.752 --> 09:53.523
and crops in the daytime, and then they would 
return to their village, and all movement would

09:41.752 --> 09:53.523
cease after dark. Anything we knew was considered 
hostile for those Vietnamese, US forces, as well

09:53.543 --> 09:57.207
as the the local forces, what we call the PLs, I 
guess that's the popular forces, that were

09:58.148 --> 10:04.234
defending their little village of Hamlet. Later 
on in the year, when I moved up to the northern

10:05.976 --> 10:26.978
I-Corps, in the area from Guaviette north and 
Guaviette west of the Laotian border, I found that

10:05.976 --> 10:26.978
there were no villagers or people living in 
villages. They had all been taken from the

10:30.076 --> 10:34.523
countryside and taken to resettlement areas. 
These are camps that the U.S., I guess in

10:35.764 --> 10:46.961
conjunction with the U.S. Army, had constructed 
where they relocated everyone and they lived

10:35.764 --> 10:46.961
there. They lived there until the war was over. So 
in Northern I-Corps, there was no local populace

10:50.126 --> 10:57.957
out in the countryside. If we saw anyone, he was 
hostile. He was considered the authority of the

11:02.016 --> 11:06.622
leaves. Did this have any conflict with such 
villages or groups of Indians such as the

11:06.642 --> 11:19.560
Montagnards who were really not active in the war? 
I didn't get up into the mountain area where the

11:19.980 --> 11:24.366
Montagnards were working.

11:28.514 --> 11:34.442
To my knowledge,

11:28.514 --> 11:34.442
they were not resettled. I think they remain in the 
mountains. Special forces working there. They

11:41.412 --> 11:47.059
were not located in the area. So I just don't have 
any knowledge or information. In the field, I

11:51.225 --> 11:53.408
understand that many the commanding officers 
were thought of as kings, and that whatever they

11:53.692 --> 11:59.721
said was the ultimate word. Did you feel or see any 
such power? Oh, absolutely.

12:10.897 --> 12:11.918
I can call their lives. I can determine when they 
can go out of the field, when they can return to the

12:13.080 --> 12:17.586
United States. I found when I took over my company 
conditions as far as the welfare

12:23.425 --> 12:36.439
of the Marines were cautious.

12:40.102 --> 12:40.803
Sanitation was poor. Personal sanitation was 
poor. They weren't well fed, and there were ways to

12:43.726 --> 12:49.913
take care of the troops whenever they were in the 
field. You required them to go out there and cut

12:49.933 --> 12:51.254
their hair. You required them to shave every day. 
we operated

12:53.682 --> 13:17.462
in the field continuously very seldom did we ever 
go back to a camp area where we could change clothes

12:53.682 --> 13:17.462
and take a shower when we did that was the first 
thing we did but also had fresh clothes blown into

12:53.682 --> 13:17.462
us where we just take off our old clothes put them 
back on and put them on a helicopter from shipping

13:17.982 --> 13:24.872
out to Washington and fresh them. I had a different 
type of rations in there other than the old C

13:24.892 --> 13:29.860
rations that we made. They were called the B 
rations. You got the dehydrated foods, hamburger

13:31.622 --> 13:44.301
patties, rice, ketchup, mustard, beans, things 
like that to supplement the C rations.

13:44.321 --> 13:45.002
The C rations is a high-nutrition, well-balanced 
ration. But it gets old. There are 12 types of

13:52.908 --> 13:57.873
meals, and that's all you get. And I was determined 
when I got there to eat those meals to keep my health

13:57.893 --> 14:03.840
up. And I found after three months in the field that 
I was even being selective in what I ate. And when

14:10.187 --> 14:16.153
you become selective, then you don't get that 
balanced diet that you ate in the spring. When that

14:16.808 --> 14:19.031
happens, people get sores. They get injured. 
Those injuries become sores, and you might have to

14:20.994 --> 14:28.084
evacuate someone to be treated because you get big 
sores.

14:30.908 --> 14:36.396
With the change of diet, we've corrected all of 
that. Another example, during the monsoons when

14:36.416 --> 14:46.090
it's so wet, you can get immersion, but you stay wet 
all the time. I had people... Our eyes should be on

14:47.116 --> 14:53.543
three pairs of socks, and we changed three times a 
day. Me on the move, your feet would get wet every

14:53.563 --> 14:57.948
time we would stop and take your socks off. But on a 
fresh pair, you'd rain those socks out and tuck

14:57.968 --> 15:05.696
them down on the inside of your trousers where your 
body would cause the moisture to evaporate. So you

15:05.716 --> 15:10.221
always had a dry pair when we were back in Iowa. 
tactical position not on the move or have certain

15:11.365 --> 15:40.275
forces out that means you have certain a certain 
percentage of your company my company in fact i'd

15:11.365 --> 15:40.275
have to take your boots and socks off use foot 
powder and let there be there i think you do that all

15:11.365 --> 15:40.275
day every day whenever they weren't uh on the move 
that's a fairly emergent problem but had i not done

15:11.365 --> 15:40.275
something like that people would have well i 
Whenever I took over my company, people were being

15:41.116 --> 15:53.572
medevaced on the helicopter that I came in on 
because they had a mission.

15:53.592 --> 15:59.400
Did you command your men, or how did you motivate 
them to fight?

16:02.604 --> 16:05.228
Well, I obviously commanded them. As in, how did 
you command and motivate them to fight? First of

16:09.033 --> 16:09.874
all, I... I sat high standards. I maintained those 
standards. When I took over the company, I felt it

16:15.667 --> 16:19.414
was a drag tag outfit. They had long hair. They had 
not shaven in days, maybe a week.

16:28.110 --> 16:31.075
The previous company commander had allowed these 
conditions to exist. I felt their morale was down.

16:35.639 --> 16:37.721
I went in there and raised the standards. I said, 
when you're not in contact with the enemy, we will

16:37.842 --> 16:46.832
shave every day.

16:46.872 --> 16:48.113
We got haircuts. We had flippers sent out to us so 
that whenever we weren't fighting, we could get

16:48.234 --> 16:57.064
haircuts and maintain our hygiene. It didn't take 
long for the troops to realize that I was taken care

16:57.084 --> 17:03.351
of. And whenever you're doing down, they'll fight 
for you. But by maintaining standards and

17:10.448 --> 17:17.495
enforcing them, that required them to execute. 
When you require people to execute, they'll fight

17:17.515 --> 17:22.040
for you in combat. Bringing in better food to take

17:22.060 --> 17:27.787
care of. Any time we were on the move or I had people 
out operating independently, I would honor them.

17:34.550 --> 17:41.201
They contact with them constantly by radio, 
asking them where they were. Usually, let's say I

17:42.042 --> 17:50.215
was moving my rifle company five miles in the 
jungle. I'm the guy steering the train, so to

17:52.599 --> 17:56.586
speak. Everyone else tunes out. He's in charge, 
you don't have to worry about him anymore. We might

18:02.950 --> 18:12.994
be strung out over three miles, and I would radio 
back to the plume commanders periodically and ask

18:02.950 --> 18:12.994
them where they were. I kept the pressure on them so 
that they would have to keep up with where they

18:13.784 --> 18:18.128
were. They might be a half mile or a mile behind me, 
but if something happened to me, I was knocked out,

18:18.148 --> 18:25.775
one of them would have to take over. They would have 
to call in the artillery and aircraft. They had to

18:28.778 --> 18:31.341
know where they were to do that. And that was part of 
the training program that I went through. So that

18:35.164 --> 18:39.869
they would know where they were.

18:39.889 --> 18:42.171
Was this motivational? or the level of motivation 
that they felt, is it any different or any lower or

18:43.552 --> 18:54.608
higher than that of an individual coming out of, 
say, boot camp?

19:00.297 --> 19:11.854
I'm not sure there's any

19:00.297 --> 19:11.854
thing as motivational as coming out of boot camp 
for a young Marine. He has proven himself to be a

19:13.994 --> 19:18.018
Marine. And

19:18.038 --> 19:22.843
he's extremely proud of that. War and combat in the 
war is a different situation. You come out of there

19:24.065 --> 19:31.493
knowing that you survived. And that's a different 
type of, that's a relief as opposed to a

19:31.513 --> 19:38.039
motivation. After an engagement or a battle, I can 
assure you that everyone was on the emotional

19:43.728 --> 19:46.271
high. I won't call it motivation, but the 
adrenaline would be up and let's say your battle

19:46.351 --> 19:58.643
ended at 5 o'clock in the afternoon. You may stay 
awake all night being unable to sleep or may not be

19:58.663 --> 20:11.856
able to go to sleep until 3 or 4 in the morning 
because of the emotional high that you

19:58.663 --> 20:11.856
experienced after the battle. Was the level of 
motivation or the way in which you commanded your

20:13.951 --> 20:22.619
men any different from the way you led them in 1963?

20:29.745 --> 20:40.415
Well, the situation was entirely different in 68 
and 69 than it was in

20:29.745 --> 20:40.415
63. We didn't have the same problems we were 
engaged in. combat or the threat of engaging with

20:43.229 --> 20:50.455
the enemy did not exist in 1963. So I would say, yes, 
there was a difference. And as a captain in 68 and

20:54.679 --> 21:02.486
69, I was more experienced, more seasoned. You had 
to handle people better. I had a bigger bag of tools

21:03.166 --> 21:11.634
to use

21:03.166 --> 21:11.634
in 1968 than I did in 1963. Sir? Were there any 
problems with sexual harassment of the

21:12.794 --> 21:19.044
Vietnamese or the torching of villages?

21:23.932 --> 21:28.760
To my knowledge, there was no problem with sexual 
harassment. Again, we were operating in a

21:28.780 --> 21:35.971
no-man's country where everyone was hostile. 
There were no females there, as I said, indicated

21:36.011 --> 21:39.477
they were back in the resettlement camps. Those 
camps were not guarded by U.S. forces, so there

21:40.047 --> 21:49.696
were no females around, according to Mark. 
Torture, I'm aware of

21:49.716 --> 22:04.249
situations where other people got in trouble 
because they allowed prisoners of war to be

21:49.716 --> 22:04.249
tortured. I know in my country, I was told after I 
took over, That's company commander that after a

22:08.600 --> 22:13.926
big fight. Pick up some of the guys. Rock them 
hoping that they would die. Because they had their

22:22.334 --> 22:27.460
good buddy killed. Frustrated. They really 
didn't want to take. I know of no one in particular.

22:38.350 --> 22:47.621
or any specific example of an arpeggio that means 
he was killed by anyone in my

22:38.350 --> 22:47.621
company. If that did occur, the commanding 
officer

22:47.641 --> 22:59.016
should not have

22:47.641 --> 22:59.016
let it occur. And in fairness to him, these could 
have been sea stories, and troops like to

22:59.036 --> 23:05.083
embellish things and go on here, unfortunately. 
that you want to take prisoners of war. They're a

23:10.663 --> 23:12.166
source of intelligence. You get those guys and you 
evacuate them on a helicopter

23:12.186 --> 23:24.869
back to the intelligence agencies as quickly as 
you can. During my tour, I know of no atrocities

23:24.889 --> 23:30.058
that were committed anywhere within the 3rd 
Marine Committee. Before I went up to the northern

23:32.232 --> 23:46.085
part of Vietnam and took over my company, a captain 
who had the company up in the 3rd Marines was sent

23:32.232 --> 23:46.085
down to be named the court-martial because he had 
torched the village.

23:49.088 --> 23:53.412
He stayed in the same hooch with me. I thought he was 
waiting for

23:53.432 --> 23:58.797
his court-martial. He was convicted of torching 
the village. But he was given no punishment,

24:01.072 --> 24:05.720
obviously in his career. But as he told the panel of 
colonels that sat on him, the court martians, you

24:05.740 --> 24:21.048
take, you go into a village or you're patrolling an 
area and you take fire, rifle fire out of there

24:05.740 --> 24:21.048
every day. You go in, there's no one there, except 
some local villagers. I think you know that

24:24.933 --> 24:27.436
they're hiding for the income. They've got caves 
and tunnels

24:28.398 --> 24:34.987
and so forth. What happened, I believe, in this 
case, I think one day they were taking some fire.

24:38.952 --> 24:41.075
They probably had some casualties. When they went 
through, someone just reached up there and lit a

24:41.095 --> 24:47.143
flash through the village.

24:49.773 --> 25:03.811
After he explained that, I remember his words, you 
old colonels back here in the rear don't know what

24:49.773 --> 25:03.811
it's like going out there every day and getting 
shot at from this one particular village. Pretty

25:05.353 --> 25:12.081
soon, and you know the Viet Cong are there, and that 
the villages are hiding them. So I just watched the

25:12.101 --> 25:18.749
Marine Corps court-martialing though. It was 
wrong. And so he's crazy. There is another,

25:23.539 --> 25:38.420
there's a colonel

25:23.539 --> 25:38.420
in the Marine Corps right now who was interviewed 
on this TV series, a documentary on Vietnam. And I

25:38.440 --> 25:44.569
believe there was a similar type of boy in there. He 
may have clutched the legs. I'm not sure. I know he

25:50.241 --> 25:53.364
didn't get court-martialed. But yes, that type of 
thing went on. And the guy that's in the field and

25:56.467 --> 26:04.355
lives with it on a daily basis has a different 
perspective of the people that are in the rear.

26:04.375 --> 26:13.484
What looks black and white to people from a 
distance isn't quite black and white when you're

26:04.375 --> 26:13.484
out there and you're facing them. Is there kind of 
a... defend their their acts by by knowing that the

26:18.063 --> 26:43.530
villagers supported them feeling that they did i 
mean you can be so so nice to the villagers but when

26:18.063 --> 26:43.530
they go out and they support the uh the vietcong or 
whatever you know vietnamization doesn't even

26:18.063 --> 26:43.530
work well they uh they weren't defending their 
acts And they didn't kill any of the villagers.

26:47.073 --> 26:52.059
They got the villagers out of the village before 
they tortured them. But by eliminating where they

26:52.079 --> 27:00.189
lived, the villagers had to move on, and that was no 
longer a trouble spot. That was their thought

27:00.209 --> 27:07.238
process, the torture.

27:07.258 --> 27:10.041
How did the generation of soldiers respond to the 
war?

27:15.927 --> 27:23.658
Some

27:15.927 --> 27:23.658
responded extremely well, others not well at all.

27:27.624 --> 27:33.272
I don't know if the difference is a matter of 
education or awareness. Some people are natural

27:35.355 --> 27:36.737
fighters. They come from the city and they just 
love a good fight.

27:45.712 --> 27:48.859
opposed to fighting, but they got drafted. Those 
guys did make themselves

27:48.879 --> 27:53.991
as your good friends in combat. As we know, we had a 
lot of people go to Canada. We had draft fighters.

27:58.701 --> 27:59.824
We had people that demonstrated. It was your large 
college crowd that did that.

28:09.792 --> 28:26.035
With the media that is available nowadays, it's 
much easier to generate support for a movement

28:09.792 --> 28:26.035
than it was, let's say, in 1941 during the

28:09.792 --> 28:26.035
Second World War. It was not a popular war.

28:30.581 --> 28:33.525
Most people didn't understand why we were over 
there and fighting. Anyone who didn't understand

28:34.266 --> 28:38.432
that probably was reluctant to go over there. 
Those that really put any thought into it, I'd say

28:38.935 --> 28:45.180
would be lucky to go there. Except some people had 
to get in the Marines, where to get away from the bad

28:45.200 --> 28:50.385
way of life, where they were brought up.

28:53.568 --> 28:59.113
And I actually, I had Marines under me who just 
thrived on being in combat. I had others that did

28:59.133 --> 29:04.237
not. You had stated in your previous interview 
that there's, You didn't really know of any

29:08.433 --> 29:10.716
problems with fragging. You had heard of 
incidences. But was there a level of instruction

29:12.780 --> 29:32.770
or a low level of instruction that the lieutenants 
did not receive or did receive before they went

29:12.780 --> 29:32.770
into Vietnam?

29:32.790 --> 29:34.252
About fragging? Well, no, not about fragging. 
somewhat like about leading and having their men

29:36.074 --> 29:42.281
follow them and not having enough experience.

29:47.867 --> 29:56.617
Well, in the Marine Corps, we send all of our junior 
officers to basic schools where they're trained

29:47.867 --> 29:56.617
as infantrymen. Then they're sent into their 
various schools for their various specialties.

30:03.946 --> 30:05.828
That was a six-month-long school. the top second 
lieutenants, the basics of the Marine Corps, from

30:06.297 --> 30:22.176
maintaining a vehicle to the supply system to 
leadership, many hours of leadership and

30:06.297 --> 30:22.176
tactics.

30:22.637 --> 30:34.572
So yes, the young leaders or the young officers in 
the Marine Corps were prepared before they went in

30:22.637 --> 30:34.572
there. You still have people that aren't the best 
leaders, but get thrown into a situation where

30:36.065 --> 30:47.799
they don't lead well,

30:36.065 --> 30:47.799
and they could get cracked in a case like that. A guy 
that was a typical chicken and uncomfortable with

30:48.460 --> 30:58.512
the troops for some reason could get cracked.

31:03.740 --> 31:07.444
possibly even staff not commissioned officers 
could be, I don't know. The fragging that I heard

31:07.464 --> 31:21.300
about was always back in the rear area, a base camp, 
so to speak, where you had a large transit

31:07.464 --> 31:21.300
population going in and out. These were people 
that were avoiding going out into the combat

31:21.320 --> 31:28.328
units. They were the recalcitrants.

31:35.127 --> 31:38.091
I don't guess they might have retaliated. I have no 
friends and no one by name that was fractured.

31:48.327 --> 31:51.732
You're talking about the staff positions.

31:54.616 --> 32:04.611
What was the general feeling towards the rear 
echelon people, being that they had never seen the

32:04.895 --> 32:05.976
front line?

32:13.786 --> 32:23.157
Well, I don't know how to answer that, mainly 
because I didn't have any feelings one way or the

32:13.786 --> 32:23.157
other about it. I had my job to do, and I was out there 
doing it. The people in the rear had to provide the

32:30.545 --> 32:34.690
support for me and the intelligence. So they were 
providing a vital function for me.

32:47.467 --> 32:51.392
Turn that off

32:47.467 --> 32:51.392
just a second. There was the standard joke around 
about the USO shows like Bob Hope and the others and

32:51.412 --> 32:58.341
Margaret and so forth. that would come into 
Vietnam. It was always the guys in the rear that got

33:00.321 --> 33:07.530
to go to those shows, and never the guys in the 
field. The guys up winning the war never got to

33:07.550 --> 33:16.221
enjoy St. Bob Hope and Aunt Margaret or something 
like that. And so in that regard, there was

33:16.241 --> 33:21.588
resentment for the folks in the field. I pertain 
to, let's say, big decision-making, when a big

33:29.067 --> 33:36.415
operation is going to happen and a general officer 
makes a decision, the general officer is not

33:29.067 --> 33:36.415
fighting on the front line. How is that felt by many 
of the people on the front line when they had to

33:37.356 --> 33:50.111
follow somebody who didn't really, or in their 
mind, they didn't feel that he knew the situation,

33:37.356 --> 33:50.111
what was going on in the front line? I'm not sure 
that anyone even thought like that until I didn't

33:50.131 --> 33:55.817
know what the situation was. We all hoped that the 
general knew what he was doing, and that any

33:58.649 --> 34:20.842
mission that we were sent on was a valid mission, 
because there was always the possibility that you

33:58.649 --> 34:20.842
would lose someone, and you didn't want to lose 
someone for a mission that was executed

33:58.649 --> 34:20.842
on time. Yes, sir. What was the general consensus 
pertaining to the way people demonstrated back in

34:21.063 --> 34:27.913
the United States against the war?

34:30.813 --> 34:35.857
Well, I don't think you can say there's a general 
consensus. If you were a liberal, you would say

34:35.877 --> 34:40.522
that the demonstrations were good and you were all 
for them. If you were a conservative, you would say

34:40.542 --> 34:45.826
that the demonstrations were bad. Was there a poll 
taken by the media? I'm sure there was with George

34:51.331 --> 34:59.318
Harris and everyone else, and they could say so 
many, a certain percentage was for the war and a

34:51.331 --> 34:59.318
certain percentage was not. I don't recall any of 
the numbers now, but I'm sure that the majority of

35:00.158 --> 35:10.032
the people supported the war effort initially. 
And as the war dragged on, and I mean month by month,

35:10.052 --> 35:14.979
that supported the time. And at some point, I'm 
sure it was less than 50% of the nation. I know that

35:19.905 --> 35:21.588
supported the war. I know whenever ICAF came home 
from Vietnam in 1969, the general reaction,

35:27.715 --> 35:30.679
people in my home from the people in my hometown. 
Well, I guess the war is necessary. You guys are

35:34.104 --> 35:39.391
there for a good cause, but I just wish the war would 
be over. The Americans are the nature of the

35:39.411 --> 35:46.782
Americans is we like to get in and do something 
quickly. Be done with it, whether it's in business

35:46.802 --> 35:51.208
or anything else. And I think that was the general 
attitude toward war. Let's get in and get this

35:55.644 --> 36:00.969
thing over with so we can put it behind us. Were 
there specific liberal or conservative

36:00.989 --> 36:16.043
separations in the field, like groups of 
individuals who did believe in one way and groups

36:00.989 --> 36:16.043
that believed in another way for the war and 
against the war? Oh, I'm sure there were. I'm sure

36:19.146 --> 36:21.668
there were individuals who believed that way. 
When you're in a rifle company and you're out in the

36:22.053 --> 36:29.843
field, though, everyone's life depends on how 
well the fella next to him does his job. It's called

36:31.085 --> 36:32.046
survival. You don't choose teams, you just decide 
to debate when you're out there in the field,

36:34.289 --> 36:44.682
because that's the wrong time.

36:44.702 --> 36:50.490
When I was in the field the whole time, we were back 
in the rear area, club, drinking a few beers. I'm

36:51.517 --> 36:56.223
sure they've got decent debates like that. But we 
had a job to do. As I say, our survival depended on

36:58.386 --> 37:03.554
everyone doing their job. Were there many racial 
problems between whites, blacks, and Vietnamese

37:03.574 --> 37:09.382
in the field? Well, again, we didn't operate with 
the Vietnamese, so I didn't see any racial

37:09.402 --> 37:17.052
problems with the Americans and the Vietnamese.

37:19.900 --> 37:30.376
And out in the field, there were

37:19.900 --> 37:30.376
no racial problems. I would not have tolerated 
him. When I say that, I wouldn't have. He said, what

37:32.839 --> 37:34.061
would I have done? Had I had problems? I don't know. 
But I didn't have any problems. I do know back in the

37:39.770 --> 37:47.241
rear area, the blacks would congregate in one area 
and do their thing.

37:51.136 --> 37:53.058
I just don't have any first-hand experience.

37:56.001 --> 38:06.152
But where everyone's life depends on the fellow 
next to him, and if he's in a combat situation, we

37:56.001 --> 38:06.152
just don't have that problem. I'm talking about 
infantry company, not civil. The guy that you

38:10.617 --> 38:15.802
share a boxhole with, if you're white, may be 
black. And the color of the skin doesn't make any

38:15.822 --> 38:20.367
difference when you're in that situation. I had 
one platoon that was led by a black sergeant, one of

38:20.920 --> 38:39.308
the finest men I know, a tremendous leader, and he 
had no trouble at all running that platoon. When I

38:39.329 --> 38:48.042
was a sergeant running a platoon, I had a shortage 
of staff, non-commissioned officers, and this

38:39.329 --> 38:48.042
platoon leader went back to the United States 
Three weeks leave, and it took him a while to get

38:48.713 --> 39:03.737
back, but this black sergeant ran the platoon for 
about five weeks, and I was lost in responsibility

38:48.713 --> 39:03.737
for a

38:48.713 --> 39:03.737
young man. My weapons platoon commander was a 
black staff sergeant,

39:03.757 --> 39:09.727
and he had no problems. So out in the field, I just 
didn't experience any problems.
