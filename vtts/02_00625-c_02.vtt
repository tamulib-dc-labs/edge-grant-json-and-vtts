00:17.851 --> 00:31.851
What we were talking yesterday about, really 
about concepts of the environment, and I wanted to

00:17.851 --> 00:31.851
open up today by asking how you react to people like 
Jacques Cousteau, for example, who talk about

00:17.851 --> 00:31.851
oceans dying.

00:34.515 --> 00:43.808
Well, I don't take them too seriously except the 
impact they have on this. community and congress

00:44.024 --> 01:12.765
and so on that their voices is rather loud out of 
proportion probably to the amount of information

00:44.024 --> 01:12.765
they have available these environmental 
questions are certainly very complicated and and

00:44.024 --> 01:12.765
many of them were i think we have only very 
fragmentary information about And it's going to

01:13.471 --> 01:19.419
take a long time to actually solve them. It's 
probably some merit in drawing attention to the

01:20.139 --> 01:32.836
problems in general through advocates such as 
Cousteau, who speak out very loudly on them. But I

01:32.856 --> 01:40.305
think that they probably create more problems 
than they resolve.

01:43.778 --> 01:49.786
Well, how would you call attention, let's say, to 
the average American concerning problems of

01:43.778 --> 01:49.786
science in the environment?

01:52.330 --> 01:56.155
Oh, this is even more complicated. An aspect of it 
that interests me is really, I think, the semantic

01:56.315 --> 02:08.631
question. And it involves... at least two aspects 
and one is just the general question of vocabulary

02:13.951 --> 02:42.844
of not understanding each other's words but the 
more fundamental one is how you can draw people's

02:13.951 --> 02:42.844
attention to and inform them about features of the 
art environment

02:13.951 --> 02:42.844
which have not in their experience or education 
being recognized as significant features that

02:43.229 --> 03:00.495
this is a problem that I'm confronted with right 
now in the Institute for Marine Studies of trying

02:43.229 --> 03:00.495
to describe certain characteristics of the ocean 
and the processes that affect the ocean in terms

03:01.741 --> 03:18.862
that will be meaningful to lawyers and other 
people whose educational experience has been in

03:01.741 --> 03:18.862
the social sciences.

03:22.507 --> 03:30.617
Now, when these people come to your institute, the 
first thing you do, do you spend time describing

03:22.507 --> 03:30.617
the ocean and the ocean's viability? Well, one of 
the first courses they take is one which I teach,

03:30.833 --> 04:00.587
which I call the ocean system, which is 
essentially a

03:30.833 --> 04:00.587
comprehensive

03:30.833 --> 04:00.587
course in terms of subject matter, but obviously 
not a very profound one about the characteristics

03:30.833 --> 04:00.587
of the ocean atmosphere and other of the 
environmental components that make up what I call

04:00.871 --> 04:08.079
the ocean system. And so it's primarily just a 
direct task of trying to provide some

04:09.000 --> 04:29.022
understanding with the constraint that they have 
very little scientific background, most of these

04:09.000 --> 04:29.022
people. And it's also a problem of essentially 
getting and holding their interest in matters

04:29.744 --> 04:47.441
which in many cases must seem to them as trivial and 
insignificant and unimportant. And this is the

04:47.461 --> 04:57.270
kind of problem that intrigues me very much here as 
to how one can gain the necessary rapport to be able

04:47.461 --> 04:57.270
to communicate adequately with these people 
without the great depth of scientific

04:58.297 --> 05:06.346
understanding. And so, primarily then, the 
Marine Institute, what you're trying to do is

05:06.366 --> 05:13.313
appoint the layman then, I suppose. Well, we don't 
go very far into educating the public here. We're

05:21.301 --> 05:23.764
concerned with with the education of a relatively 
small number of

05:24.588 --> 05:34.022
what we hope will be sort of experts later on. And 
yet the same sort of problem, I think, is common to

05:35.244 --> 05:49.305
almost any audience outside of the scientific 
community. And even within science, you have the

05:49.325 --> 05:54.072
same sort of communications problems these days. 
The point I'm trying to emphasize to you, it's not

05:54.608 --> 06:03.099
just a matter of vocabulary, although this is a 
fairly large component. It's even conceptual.

06:05.682 --> 06:13.312
One of the sort of an example of this was that there 
are, of course, many so-called laws in science.

06:13.332 --> 06:23.164
And it dawned on me one day that to a lawyer, the term 
law certainly has a different meaning than the way

06:13.332 --> 06:23.164
it is used. Science,

06:23.701 --> 06:28.072
oh. Go

06:28.092 --> 06:33.185
ahead. Now,

06:33.205 --> 06:40.123
when they're through with the institute, or when 
they finish what amounts to their curriculum in

06:40.525 --> 06:49.056
the institute, then do you expect them to go to work 
for the government or simply be more aware of

06:40.525 --> 06:49.056
environmental problems? We've entered this 
topic by the back door here. The institute was set

06:53.342 --> 07:08.001
up about five years ago by the university as a 
graduate activity to offer graduate courses and

06:53.342 --> 07:08.001
conduct research. what we now call an area of 
marine affairs. And what we're striving to do is to

07:12.259 --> 07:36.756
draw together the information and techniques and 
understanding from a variety of different fields

07:12.259 --> 07:36.756
and give the students an opportunity to get a kind 
of breadth of understanding of what these

07:12.259 --> 07:36.756
problems are. these three there are in general 
sort of three general areas of disciplines that

07:36.972 --> 07:58.643
are involved one being the natural sciences or the 
environmental scientists the other two are

07:36.972 --> 07:58.643
involved the social sciences economics law 
political science anthropology, hopefully some

07:59.230 --> 08:14.347
history, and then the technological sciences or 
engineering sciences that concern with how you

07:59.230 --> 08:14.347
do, how you carry out various kinds of operations. 
And these are obviously focused on the ocean, so

08:15.148 --> 08:21.716
they're sort of the marine technologies. So we're 
working on a very broad sort of base. At the moment,

08:29.251 --> 08:34.858
we're concentrating on a two-year master's 
program. And during that time, the principal sort

08:35.759 --> 08:45.871
of effort will be to provide students with a sort of 
breadth in these various fields. And I mentioned

08:46.391 --> 08:49.115
the one course that I teach. I also offer a second 
one, which has more concern with how you apply the

08:53.939 --> 09:03.572
environmental information to a variety of 
different sort of problems that affect human

08:53.939 --> 09:03.572
activities. I don't deal with the economic or 
legal or political issues, although I have to keep

09:04.634 --> 09:23.119
these things in mind, otherwise we wouldn't be 
meeting our goal of trying to develop an

09:04.634 --> 09:23.119
interdisciplinary program.

09:24.382 --> 09:32.571
Aside from the textbook, which everybody 
concedes is a major contribution to

09:24.382 --> 09:32.571
oceanography, what would you name as your other 
most important contribution? I realize that's a

09:33.272 --> 09:36.035
terrible question to ask you, but nevertheless. 
Well, I agree with you. I think it's a terrible one.

09:42.502 --> 09:52.633
I think that probably the development of the 
undergraduate program here at the University of

09:42.502 --> 09:52.633
Washington, and I I select that rather than the 
graduate program, which is obviously closely

09:53.187 --> 10:12.929
coupled to it, because there have been a number of 
opportunities for graduate study in this

09:53.187 --> 10:12.929
country, although we were the pioneers, really, 
in the undergraduate program. There are a couple

10:14.090 --> 10:22.840
of other things that I will be inclined to bring up 
that I am rather proud of, One of them was that I

10:23.191 --> 10:28.057
broke the color line in the hydrographic office. 
Well, I was there up until that time. The blacks,

10:31.161 --> 10:36.267
particularly, had never been hired except for 
very low-level jobs. And I started implying black

10:36.367 --> 10:41.173
professionals. And after that, why, the doors 
were open. The other star I had in my crown, maybe

10:44.857 --> 10:49.823
rather tarnished, is that I essentially opened up 
the opportunities for women in oceanography

10:50.275 --> 11:20.215
because I employed

10:50.275 --> 11:20.215
girls, ladies, both during the war and in 
Washington, and more particularly I made it

10:50.275 --> 11:20.215
possible for them to go to sea, which was one of the 
more difficult obstacles to overcome 20, 30 years

10:50.275 --> 11:20.215
ago when there was a very strong prejudice against 
having females on board ship. So I think I

11:26.250 --> 11:33.879
contributed my small part, at least towards the 
liberation of the females. There has always been a

11:34.760 --> 11:48.597
charge leveled at the sciences, rightly or 
wrongly, that scientists or the discipline of

11:34.760 --> 11:48.597
science itself has had the greatest amount of 
prejudice towards women. Would you agree with

11:48.617 --> 11:49.358
that? I don't

11:51.042 --> 12:01.296
think it's been particularly noticeable as a 
prejudice against women. There's certainly been

12:01.356 --> 12:17.117
the feeling that in many cases they were 
physically incapable

12:01.356 --> 12:17.117
of going to sea because of the strenuous nature of 
the work that had to be carried on, but that is

12:17.502 --> 12:23.251
certainly no longer the case. The other concern in 
years gone by, which I shared in some degree, was

12:23.271 --> 12:42.683
the fact that I thought it was probably in many 
cases in a sense a poor investment to spend time and

12:23.271 --> 12:42.683
effort in educating girls in science and then have 
them get married and leave the field. It just

12:48.477 --> 12:52.245
wasn't, in a sense, very cost effective in a way. 
But I think the opportunities have existed for a

12:54.088 --> 12:59.980
long time. I'm surprised that more haven't, in a 
way, gone into the field than I see. Many of them are

13:07.836 --> 13:19.491
apparently attracted by it, but are unable to 
continue through to, well, let's say, a PhD level.

13:19.711 --> 13:26.659
They get discouraged or get distracted and tend to 
leave earlier than that. But I have a feeling that a

13:27.601 --> 13:30.304
lot of, females would like to be associated with 
science rather than actually be scientists, but

13:31.043 --> 13:42.115
this is hard to offer any sort of evidence on this. 
One thing that doesn't interest me very much is the

13:42.716 --> 13:56.832
fact that we're getting quite a few females in the 
Institute for Marine Studies program, which sort

13:42.716 --> 13:56.832
of surprised me because I hadn't anticipated 
this. And it may be that this sort of

13:57.537 --> 14:14.594
interdisciplinary policy management type 
problems is something to which they're

13:57.537 --> 14:14.594
singularly endowed and maybe are better at it than 
the men who may prefer to specialize. But this is

14:14.674 --> 14:17.737
purely my own speculation. I don't know if there's 
any basis for it at all. I think even the domestic

14:20.960 --> 14:25.384
chores that most women undertake a very 
complicated set of policy and management

14:26.022 --> 14:29.886
problem. And maybe they're better able to cope 
with all these interacting type

14:29.986 --> 14:44.743
things that go towards the household than a man is. 
Now, the next series of questions I have to ask

14:44.763 --> 14:51.991
really concerns sort of the future of 
oceanography.

14:52.011 --> 14:53.633
First of all, is that there have have been sort of in 
fields in oceanography, if I may use that word.

14:59.175 --> 15:04.843
That, for example, nuclear engineering was a big 
field in oceanography in the late 50s and early

14:59.175 --> 15:04.843
60s. What sort of do you see now as the future of 
oceanography, the in fields? What would you tell a

15:08.688 --> 15:13.995
young oceanographer to do beside his interest? 
Well,

15:14.015 --> 15:24.109
I think we went through a period that probably 
fifteen, maybe twenty years began in the late

15:25.220 --> 15:36.057
fifties when there was a good deal of popular 
interest in the ocean. not only as being a sort of

15:36.779 --> 15:56.864
adventurous region, the last frontier, and 
similar sort of analogies were drawn, but that a

15:36.779 --> 15:56.864
lot of young people had the idea that this was an 
environment in which there was a lot of

15:36.779 --> 15:56.864
opportunity to make money. And I think now this 
attitude is changing. But it certainly attracted

16:02.231 --> 16:05.976
a great many the young people in that period. As far 
as the future is concerned, it's

16:11.418 --> 16:29.601
inevitable that the world will depend to an 
increasing amount upon the resources of the ocean

16:11.418 --> 16:29.601
and upon the use of the ocean for purposes that are 
related but not directly dependent on marine

16:30.256 --> 16:36.582
resources. Transportation is an example of this. 
And I think there's a great deal of opportunity in

16:41.587 --> 16:56.922
essentially innovative types of engineering and 
the development of possibly entirely new kinds of

16:57.475 --> 17:25.407
of engineering enterprises that, and these are 
always hard to really identify, and

16:57.475 --> 17:25.407
there's the whole question of food from the sea, 
which is a very, very important one, and so that

16:57.475 --> 17:25.407
anything that we can learn which will contribute 
to essentially a high level of of production in the

17:25.943 --> 17:34.194
ocean and more effective means of utilizing these 
food resources. There are many, many examples

17:35.095 --> 17:54.381
that could be cited, but I see no sort of one or two 
kind of unique developments.

17:55.036 --> 18:14.614
As we were talking earlier, if the

17:55.036 --> 18:14.614
manganese nodule mining venture goes, this 
opens, I believe, a whole array of possibilities

17:55.036 --> 18:14.614
of other types of materials that might be taken 
from the deep sea. I have nothing specific in mind

18:14.754 --> 18:21.921
here, but just the existence of a technology may 
suggest other since the applications of that kind

18:22.357 --> 18:25.641
of a technology. There's undoubtedly going to be 
further developments in the search for petroleum

18:26.522 --> 18:43.363
materials beneath the sea, and presumably this is 
also going to go into deeper and deeper water as a

18:26.522 --> 18:43.363
technology develops. But probably of almost 
equal importance these days are the questions

18:44.564 --> 18:51.553
that that arise from the environmental concern or 
the preservation of the ocean as well as possible

18:52.158 --> 19:13.840
in the face of ever increasing impacts of human 
activities on the environment. And in this sense,

19:13.900 --> 19:20.207
it's just part and parcel of the total global 
environment as I see it. I noticed you didn't

19:20.744 --> 19:24.609
mention, for example, physical oceanography or 
systematics. Well, all right. This is, as I said,

19:28.033 --> 19:32.158
there are many different examples. One of the 
things that we're probably going to see are

19:32.718 --> 19:42.070
efforts to try and obtain energy from the ocean. 
And we have a few sort of scattered relatively

19:48.233 --> 19:54.920
small examples of this, of the use of tidal energy. 
There are plans now to try and develop the thermal

19:56.141 --> 20:15.642
energy to make use of the heat that's present in the 
water, possibly to use ocean currents to drive

19:56.141 --> 20:15.642
large propeller-like devices, the equivalent of 
windmills. And there's the possibility that we

20:19.857 --> 20:28.970
may want to use the certain areas of the ocean. 
Probably they would be near the coast for the

20:29.310 --> 20:39.666
direct capture of solar energy in some scheme 
analogous to those used on land. So there are

20:39.686 --> 20:45.274
certainly a lot of physical

20:46.013 --> 20:53.620
questions or aspects of the physical 
characteristics of the ocean that are going to be

20:46.013 --> 20:53.620
important. But most of these things are going to 
take, I think, a very long time to see any great

20:55.762 --> 21:03.450
development. Do you see more and more use of 
technology in oceanography? Oh, I think this is

21:08.635 --> 21:15.261
what has hampered the field in many ways. There has 
been a revolution in technologies that has

21:16.034 --> 21:35.924
occurred really as a consequence of the 
developments in the whole field of electronics,

21:16.034 --> 21:35.924
new kinds of instruments and sensing devices that 
have come along. But these are primarily in sort of

21:36.686 --> 21:43.476
chemical, physical, and in part in the 
geophysical area. And what always seems to me to be

21:47.215 --> 22:05.802
lacking is the very slow developments of 
instrumentation and techniques in the

21:47.215 --> 22:05.802
biological field, where in many cases we're using 
methods that are roughly 100 years old. And I'm

22:06.473 --> 22:16.227
always expecting to see some major sort of 
developments in the biological aspect, but so far

22:06.473 --> 22:16.227
haven't seen a great deal.

22:23.017 --> 22:30.608
What about the use of the computer, though, in 
biology and predicting all kinds of ecosystems?

22:31.094 --> 22:36.741
A lot of computer work is being done in effect to 
build many oceans. Well, there's a lot of work

22:38.202 --> 22:42.107
going on in modeling. The computers certainly 
encourage developments of this kind, but the

22:43.168 --> 22:59.968
problem is at the present time...

22:43.168 --> 22:59.968
Do you want me to go ahead? Sure. All

23:00.372 --> 23:29.215
right, the difficulty with the development of 
models and the use of computers as a mechanism for

23:00.372 --> 23:29.215
essentially handling the numerical aspects of 
these is that there are still major gaps in basic

23:00.372 --> 23:29.215
knowledge concerning the ocean. So most of the 
models that I've seen suffer from being too

23:29.667 --> 23:43.805
restricted or too hypothetical. They're not very 
close approximation to the real ocean. One of your

23:47.770 --> 23:54.038
contemporaries has suggested that the problem 
with computer work is that they're not out in the

23:47.770 --> 23:54.038
ocean enough to know what the ocean works like. 
Would you agree with that? Well, this may be so.

23:57.122 --> 23:58.003
There have been some sort of interesting 
developments in computers, and

23:58.642 --> 24:19.823
some computers do go to sea, and not the very large 
ones, but it is possible now to process data in

23:58.642 --> 24:19.823
essentially real time, so it's available very 
quickly. And there have been some efforts made to

24:20.140 --> 24:38.937
actually predict on essentially a day-to-day 
business, I'm sorry, day-to-day basis, and then,

24:20.140 --> 24:38.937
in effect, test what the validity of the 
projections is being made by the computers. I

24:39.838 --> 24:47.025
think they serve a useful purpose, any of these 
attempts at modeling. even though they may not

24:47.410 --> 24:58.985
solve a problem, they usually tend to sharpen up 
the questions and indicate serious deficiencies

24:47.410 --> 24:58.985
in the type of information. What I'm concerned 
with here is the fact that there are very few types

24:59.646 --> 25:15.847
of measurements that are made or can be made today 
which essentially give rates at which various

24:59.646 --> 25:15.847
things are occurring. And I am not sure that we're 
going to be able to arrive at many of these, and this

25:17.245 --> 25:39.097
is one of the main difficulties with any of these 
sort of modeling techniques, the lack of

25:17.245 --> 25:39.097
understanding of the processes and the rates at 
which they occur. Now, I want to change the title

25:41.039 --> 25:43.523
for a reason.
