Wednesday, August 2nd. Testing, testing, 
testing. Wednesday, August 2nd. Testing.

00:13.301 --> 00:14.944
Testing, testing, two. Testing, two. Testing, 
two. Testing.

00:21.434 --> 00:24.739
Today is August the 2nd. And I have the great honor 
of chatting with Roland Gonzalez. Ralph. I'm

00:31.516 --> 00:32.518
sorry, Ralph. Son is Ralph. Ralph Gonzalez, class 
of 53. As we begin, sir, tell this machine about

00:38.245 --> 00:54.405
your family background, your parents, where did 
they grow up, and where did you live, and so forth,

00:38.245 --> 00:54.405
growing up. Well, my mother came over from Mexico 
when she was two years old. And they came over.

01:07.604 --> 01:13.373
There was no restrictions on immigration at the 
southern and northern borders of the United

01:07.604 --> 01:13.373
States. However, there were on the east coast and 
the west coast. And so, people would go across a

01:19.763 --> 01:23.970
bridge in Laredo free and back and forth until 
1910. So my mother came over with her four brothers

01:30.051 --> 01:40.683
and her father and mother, and they came on a horse 
and wagon. They got to San Antonio. I don't know how

01:44.688 --> 01:49.373
long the trip took, but there was no place to stay. 
So they stayed at one of the missions. because of

01:52.418 --> 01:56.844
the marauding Indians and safety. And then from 
then on they looked around and found a place to

01:56.864 --> 02:00.550
live. So my grandfather was, as you probably know, 
the field of education in Mexico was almost nil.

02:12.747 --> 02:17.193
And the people were just lettering. Not that they 
were dumb, they just didn't have the facilities to

02:17.433 --> 02:21.379
go to school. So my grandfather, that's my 
mother's father, still had his horse and wagon.

02:30.223 --> 02:37.854
And he, I don't know how he got it, but he was real 
light-complexed. He looked more like Anglo than

02:39.015 --> 02:45.444
Hispanic, blue eyes, brown hair. And he'd take his 
horse and wagon down to the Katy Depot up on South

02:45.504 --> 02:51.653
Flores. And in those days, people used to travel 
for a couple of weeks or so, and they used trunks and

02:52.527 --> 03:00.203
big suitcases. And it was a custom of the railroad 
people that they would hire these wagons, horse

03:08.373 --> 03:17.585
drawn vehicles, to deliver the trunks and the 
suitcases to the addresses. And that's how my

03:18.326 --> 03:20.428
grandfather made a living. And then

03:21.590 --> 03:28.178
my father, he came from Mexico also. He was born 
over there. And the

03:31.102 --> 03:37.570
four brothers of my mother were skilled in bicycle 
mechanics and in other words they could do more

03:38.343 --> 04:06.595
with their hands and because they didn't have the 
education and in those days they had the bicycle

03:38.343 --> 04:06.595
races from san antonio to new raffles or seguin you 
know and uh so uh my father was one of those that

03:38.343 --> 04:06.595
wanted to ride the bicycles and he met the boys and 
then he met my mother and so

04:16.227 --> 04:22.394
So my father was, he could read music. And he was a 
drummer. And he gave lessons too. And I learned how

04:28.861 --> 04:32.445
to play drums. And he worked in a grocery store in 
San Antonio. But on weekends he had his band and

04:38.932 --> 04:42.596
they'd play at dances. What kind of music did they 
play? or dance music. And so they had a good

04:50.180 --> 05:04.361
following and someone decided that hey, if you 
fellas dress up like Charles you can go on a tour.

05:05.483 --> 05:12.053
And we'll get an agent to go ahead and book you at 
those days there were night clubs. Sure enough

05:12.860 --> 05:21.873
they got the uniforms and they went on a trip and 
they were gone two years, believe it or not.

05:23.055 --> 05:35.232
Finally the end of the tour came up and it was closed 
and the musicians began to come home, except my

05:23.055 --> 05:35.232
father. He decided to stay up there. Up where? I 
think it was Chicago. And he stayed over there and

05:47.533 --> 05:57.902
then later we found out that he asked for a divorce.

05:58.186 --> 05:59.708
My mother didn't know which way to go. They had no 
advisors or anything.

06:04.977 --> 06:11.026
But divorce was granted, and so that was the end of 
him. How many brothers and sisters do you have? I

06:13.751 --> 06:17.156
have one brother and two sisters. And what part of 
San Antonio did you grow up in? Westside.

06:22.264 --> 06:23.326
Westside. San Antonio was divided. All the black 
people moved to the east side. All the Hispanics

06:31.426 --> 06:34.593
went to the west side. So whenever there was any 
repairs to streets and so forth, we were the last

06:35.875 --> 06:41.847
ones to get it. And then the well-to-do were on the 
north side. And then there was mostly Anglos that

06:47.984 --> 06:52.491
lived in the south side. Okay, so I recall that the 
Ursuline Academy had a tower, and it had four

06:53.252 --> 07:15.145
sides, and there was a clock that you could see from 
the, and there was a clock on the east and west and

06:53.252 --> 07:15.145
south side, but none on the north. Well, why was 
that? Well, you see, there was nothing on the north

07:17.785 --> 07:21.732
side except just jungle and mesquite. 
Jackrabbits, deer, and so forth. So who wanted to

07:25.258 --> 07:27.361
see the time over there? And so people ask that 
question to this day. Okay, so when I was eight

07:31.328 --> 07:43.489
years old, I was the oldest, my grandmother 
decided that I had to go out and make some dickles

07:44.178 --> 07:47.701
and dimes. So the only thing I could do was go and 
sell newspapers. And I got to a period where I knew

07:52.346 --> 07:59.673
just about the name of every street. And my 
playmates were, one was Jewish, three were

08:01.094 --> 08:11.704
Anglos, and two were black. So I picked up English 
just like that, see. So when they put me in school, I

08:14.972 --> 08:21.202
just overheard some of the teachers doing recess. 
They said, I wonder how Ralph got to speak so good

08:22.203 --> 08:26.250
English. He said, all the rest of the other 
Hispanics, they're having trouble, you know,

08:26.931 --> 08:31.618
communicating. And they couldn't understand why 
I could be, okay.

08:42.076 --> 08:52.927
I went to the grades, and

08:42.076 --> 08:52.927
I went to UNF Austin Elementary School. And

08:54.548 --> 09:07.881
I recall that there was one student there that was 
very nice and friendly, and his name And it was

09:09.717 --> 09:12.860
Gonzales, just like mine, but with a Z at the end. 
And he became Congressman Gonzales. Henry B. And

09:19.225 --> 09:21.847
then there was Albert Pena. And Albert Pena, he 
became a judge in the municipal court. And let's

09:29.774 --> 09:33.377
see, there was Edward Neary. His dad was, he worked 
for the Yellow Cab Company. and he was a starter

09:39.468 --> 09:41.750
there at the San Anthony Hotel. And I just happened 
to bump into him because I was running around

09:43.031 --> 09:48.777
selling newspapers. Mr. Neary, he was Hispanic, 
but he could pass for an Anglo because he was of this

09:50.939 --> 09:57.125
complexion. And these yellow cabs were lined up on 
the street, so when one of the clients there at the

09:58.266 --> 10:09.137
San Anthony Hotel wanted to go somewhere, he was 
the starter. And so it

10:10.552 --> 10:16.719
was a nice arrangement. I mean, going to school and 
learning and this kind of thing. And my

10:22.045 --> 10:26.811
grandmother always wanted me to be a mail carrier. 
And I don't know why. I actually figured it was a

10:30.255 --> 10:33.899
sure thing. It was a good job.

10:39.188 --> 10:43.032
I didn't think much of being a mail carrier. So, I 
grew up and went to school and I had to sell papers in

10:44.173 --> 10:53.143
the afternoon. I wanted to take- Which paper was 
that? Which paper? Both. The San Antonio Union

10:59.470 --> 11:02.393
News and the San Antonio Light. Both were the 
afternoon then? Well, in those days, They had

11:07.707 --> 11:09.209
editions. Oh, that's right. About every two 
hours, two or three hours. We had the street

11:13.614 --> 11:22.705
edition, the noon edition, the afternoon 
edition, the financial edition, and the last one,

11:13.614 --> 11:22.705
final. And a lot of people didn't want to buy the 
paper in the daytime. They wanted the financial

11:27.772 --> 11:32.818
because they wanted to see what the stock market 
had now. Did you stand on the street corner selling

11:33.378 --> 11:37.123
it, or did you deliver them? Oh no, I saw them on the 
street. You see, I could have gotten a route on a

11:40.174 --> 11:54.010
bicycle, the paper was only two cents, but I didn't 
have the money for a bicycle, and we were poor, I

11:40.174 --> 11:54.010
tell you. So I saw my papers on the street. And you 
learn to fight. Because there's always some bully

12:01.150 --> 12:10.062
that wants to, or one that doesn't want to do 
nothing and to go out there and put you in a corner

12:01.150 --> 12:10.062
and take your money away. Or to tear your papers or 
whatever. So at the beginning I was afraid and I

12:13.867 --> 12:20.215
would cry. Then I saw some other boys that wouldn't 
put up with it and they'd fight. So I started

12:26.699 --> 12:33.769
hitting back, and I found out that the bullies 
backed off when they saw that I was fighting.

12:35.231 --> 12:44.083
Anyway, and to this day, to this day, I notice that 
among the Hispanics, they're ready to fight.

12:44.483 --> 12:56.520
Because when they're growing up, they're abused, 
they're kicked around, discriminated against,

12:44.483 --> 12:56.520
and all these ugly things that happen to people who 
live at the poverty level. So I wanted to take part

12:57.580 --> 13:07.254
in sports. And so I wanted to very much to play 
baseball. And I wasn't good at basketball. I

13:15.265 --> 13:23.517
wanted to play baseball and football, but I 
couldn't because I had to go sell papers and make

13:15.265 --> 13:23.517
some wrinkles and dyes for lunch the next day and 
whatever. Now which high school did you go to? San

13:25.593 --> 13:31.201
Antonio Vocational and Technical High School, 
which was later changed to Fox Tech. So things were

13:32.923 --> 13:35.707
pretty hard there. At that time they were just 
trying to come out of the Depression. Franklin

13:40.934 --> 13:45.400
Delano Roosevelt was doing everything he could to 
put people to work. So I became a high school

13:46.201 --> 13:49.485
dropout. And I sold papers in downtown San 
Antonio. And there was a Sellers Drugstore No. 2,

13:57.758 --> 14:04.825
Wagner's Drugstore, and the Robert E. Lee Hotel. 
And so for two years, I was out. And so finally, I

14:10.951 --> 14:22.482
realized that I couldn't get a job because I didn't 
have a, they always asked me, well, did you finish

14:10.951 --> 14:22.482
high school? Do you have a high school degree? No. 
So I told him, look, I'm going to have to go back to

14:26.210 --> 14:35.859
school and find some kind of job after. Well, I went 
back to Fox Tech. Well, it was still San Antonio

14:41.824 --> 14:44.667
Technical School. And I finally made it. What year 
did you finish high school? 1937. And I was 21. So

14:55.452 --> 14:57.454
then things started to change. And I

14:58.795 --> 15:15.231
got a job working, I started working after school 
at night, working for the Monument Chevrolet

14:58.795 --> 15:15.231
Company on Florence and Martin. Joe and Harry 
Freeman owned that business. And that worked.

15:23.903 --> 15:29.829
ten, sometimes twelve bays or stalls where 
mechanics worked. And my job was to clean up the

15:29.849 --> 15:42.663
stalls with grease, get the trash out, and I'd work 
right after school until about eleven or twelve

15:29.849 --> 15:42.663
o'clock at night. What was your pay, do you 
remember? Yes, sir. The mechanics would pay me

15:47.268 --> 15:53.134
fifty cents a week, and the company paid me four. 
And it ended up with ten dollars.

15:57.550 --> 16:02.577
And you know ten dollars was money then, you see. So 
sometimes I'd go to sleep in class because of them.

16:08.845 --> 16:14.632
So I quit and I went to California thinking I'd get a 
better job over there. It didn't pan out so I came

16:15.573 --> 16:18.898
back. Now I hopped the freight. And I went over 
there to Los Angeles, but I had to get off in, I can't

16:20.890 --> 16:35.670
think of the name right now, because the bulls were 
out there picking up hobos and everything. So I had

16:36.511 --> 16:43.381
to take a streetcar or a bus to go into L.A. And when I 
had to come back, it was the same way. And I had to die

16:43.961 --> 16:50.290
because the yards, the railroads, They were full 
of police, you know, and they were picking up these

16:50.354 --> 17:02.125
vagrants, you know, and some of them would break in 
those boxcars and steal what was inside. So I came

17:02.205 --> 17:17.340
back to San Antonio and the

17:02.205 --> 17:17.340
boss that I had there said, look, we got a boy here 
that took your job. But the parts department,

17:18.451 --> 17:27.481
Frank Wyatt, he needs somebody that can talk 
Spanish over there in the parts department. I had

17:28.182 --> 17:33.508
experience working on cars. I knew parts and 
everything. So Mr. Wyatt said, I'd like to have you

17:35.831 --> 17:40.196
come over here. You have a good memory, you 
remember numbers, and you're bilingual. So I

17:47.324 --> 17:50.370
started ten dollars a week. I wore a shirt and tie 
then, you know, and so Mr. White, he would go visit

17:50.551 --> 18:08.607
the garages over on the west side, you know, to 
solicit business and also tell them, hey, I've got

17:50.551 --> 18:08.607
a place over here on Forest and Martin. And I'm 
giving you a regular 25% discount, and if we don't

18:09.380 --> 18:20.753
have the parts, we'll get them for you from the 
other dealers, or we will order them for you. So

18:20.773 --> 18:35.871
sure enough, I had some of those Hispanic 
mechanics had a limited English vocabulary, and

18:20.773 --> 18:35.871
they could express better in their own tongues. 
And so they tell me, I want this and this and this for

18:39.569 --> 18:42.914
a white model car. And the word got around, see, 
because at that time I didn't make a, I didn't do any

18:44.075 --> 18:50.084
research. In the contacts I had with the other 
automotive supply dealers, stores, I was the only

18:50.184 --> 19:00.278
one. I was the only Mexican that was working in the 
Forest Department, see. And pretty soon Pretty

19:10.130 --> 19:13.254
soon, people from Mexico were coming over. And of 
course, Harry Freeman used to talk to them about

19:14.395 --> 19:22.464
selling them new cars, new trucks. And I remember 
one of them came in there to buy a 1940

19:22.484 --> 19:32.676
Chevrolet four-door sedan. And the price was 
$940. So, I

19:39.155 --> 19:54.478
worked there in the parts department, and people 
were coming there from Mexico to buy parts to take

19:39.155 --> 19:54.478
back to Mexico. And some of them would, they would 
ask for different information, and they would

19:55.419 --> 20:08.959
send correspondence. They had other Hispanics 
working there, see, but they didn't know. And that

20:14.331 --> 20:18.156
is, they couldn't translate. So they called me, 
they said, well, what does this guy say here? He

20:23.884 --> 20:25.666
says this and this and this. Okay, well listen, can 
we call him on the telephone or something? So

20:32.836 --> 20:33.858
that's what I was doing. Then the war came. Then the 
war, well not yet. We

20:39.803 --> 20:58.987
had something like three or four automobile 
dealers in Mexico that were having difficulty

20:39.803 --> 20:58.987
getting parts from the factory back in the States. 
It was a slow procedure, so they would come to us to

20:59.828 --> 21:05.575
order big parts. to order Pontiac parts, this kind 
of thing. So, and so I got the promotion until 19,

21:08.673 --> 21:17.186
just before the war. I would make $25 a week. Hey, 
that was good. So every payday I'd give my mama $15

21:22.594 --> 21:27.121
and I'd keep $10. And my first car was a 1928 
Chevrolet. It was old, but it would take me there

21:32.234 --> 21:36.241
and bring me back. And nobody else in my 
neighborhood had anything. They had bicycles,

21:41.069 --> 21:42.371
you see. Well, so the war broke out, and on weekends 
I would drive a wrecker. And every time we had a

21:51.446 --> 21:55.272
police radio.

21:56.129 --> 22:05.119
Every time there was a call, we'd say, car 
so-and-so,

21:56.129 --> 22:05.119
go to this intersection. And that was for a major 
accident. And there were other garages that had

22:10.485 --> 22:13.468
the same thing. They would rush out there. And 
whoever got there first, usually would get the

22:15.871 --> 22:19.375
car. So that was a Sunday. It was late, maybe about 5 
o'clock. And I heard these boys hollering, you

22:26.538 --> 22:30.223
know. I didn't know what the heck they were 
hollering about, you know, because we were

22:30.824 --> 22:35.550
listening to the radio. So one of the boys brought a 
paper and says, Pearl Harbor bombed. And I didn't

22:43.340 --> 22:46.364
get the significance of it, see. It had maybe one or 
two paragraphs, and it says, the radio became

22:46.945 --> 22:53.153
silent on contact. to San Antonio, Los Angeles, 
and it wore. Yeah. So, it wasn't long. It was, let me

23:02.309 --> 23:07.134
see, about a week, week and a half. The draft board 
number two sent me a card. Greetings. Report to the

23:11.979 --> 23:14.161
draft board so and so for induction. So I went to 
Harry Freeman and says, meet up. I'm helping the

23:19.366 --> 23:23.190
family out, then can you maybe talk to the draft 
board and give me an extension or something. Well,

23:30.516 --> 23:33.860
Freeman called me in and says he wouldn't do it. So 
then the parts manager says, look, with the

23:35.302 --> 23:48.638
knowledge you have about Chevrolet parts, or 
General Motors parts, he says, don't go to the

23:35.302 --> 23:48.638
draft board. They'll put you in the infantry and 
they'll make you German fodder. Cannon fodder. He

23:57.683 --> 24:01.068
says, Hitler's boys are going to shoot you. They 
told me that in a joking manner. He says, the best

24:03.632 --> 24:11.203
thing for you to do, you go sign up now and tell them 
you want to go into the ordnance department.

24:11.424 --> 24:12.986
That's where they got all the vehicles. Well, I did 
that. Now, when did you volunteer? Do you remember

24:18.911 --> 24:20.012
when that was? Well, January 17, 1942. And so I 
wanted to get in and go into the ordnance and, hey,

24:23.958 --> 24:34.893
let me do my stuff, you know, before I know what to 
do. But that never came about. It never came about.

24:40.340 --> 24:43.785
And I requested it in writing and everything. And 
they wouldn't accept me. At the same time, I had a

24:46.437 --> 24:56.045
cousin of mine that went in, and he wanted to be an 
airplane mechanic. And he was telling me later, he

24:56.906 --> 24:59.889
says, they lined us up. And we said, I'd count off. 
And I said, I was counting. He said, start with 50. I

25:06.915 --> 25:08.116
said, all right. You guys are going to the Cooks and 
Baker School. And he says, I don't want to go. I

25:15.430 --> 25:17.373
don't want to be a baker or a cook. He says, I want to 
be an airplane mechanic. Well, that's where he

25:21.198 --> 25:22.759
went. Someplace up in Alabama. Had a school over 
there. So we got to, let me see, we turned over to

25:26.724 --> 25:40.141
Dodd Field, which was adjacent to Fort Sam 
Houston. And there we got inducted and gave us the

25:41.748 --> 25:44.732
uniform. And my past life was too long, the uniform 
didn't, you know. So I got, I think it was a couple of

25:49.978 --> 25:54.403
days off. I went home and I had my mother, you know, 
alter the fine things. So they put me on the train to

26:01.151 --> 26:07.919
go up to Paine Field, Washington. This was in 
Everett, Washington. The day it was called, the

26:11.313 --> 26:16.078
day it was changed to Everett Air Base. And so 
that's where we were sent. And instead of going to

26:23.786 --> 26:39.261
Aberdeen and train, you know, this kind of thing, 
and learn close art of drill and so forth, there was

26:23.786 --> 26:39.261
a first sergeant there at Peyton Field that he had 
some time in the Army. And because of the

26:40.068 --> 26:50.883
restrictions and because of the inadequacy of the 
basic, they made a training field, a training

26:40.068 --> 26:50.883
base. And so they got this first sergeant to teach 
us close order drill and learn how to

26:52.104 --> 27:06.223
break down or disarm small arms and rifles. 
Because we were going to be armorers. And so this is

27:09.987 --> 27:13.390
what happened. So then in

27:14.331 --> 27:19.836
June, we were to ship out. So we got our orders to be 
sure to check all our equipment, our clothes and

27:21.237 --> 27:28.864
everything, and get it ready. And everybody was 
asking, I mean, the troops were asking the First

27:30.085 --> 27:38.273
Royal General or anybody else there. Where are we 
going? We're shipping out, but where? They

27:41.909 --> 27:42.589
wouldn't tell us. Then we got a notice on the 
bulletin board from the supply sergeant, come on

27:43.971 --> 27:50.817
over there and pick up your mosquito bars. That did 
it. I said, I know where we're going. Oh boy, we're

27:54.480 --> 27:59.345
going to the southwest Pacific area, and sure 
enough. So, and we were half scared and worried

28:00.526 --> 28:07.332
because We heard all kind of ugly stories that the 
Japanese were committing atrocities and how they

28:08.020 --> 28:18.654
would torture American soldiers. And boy, it was 
awful. But anyway, we just had to do the best we can.

28:29.189 --> 28:33.394
So we went on the USS West Point. It was a liner, but 
it was a It was converted to a troop ship, and I don't

28:36.151 --> 28:45.059
know how many were on it, but it was a whole bunch of 
people. And we noticed that some of them were

28:46.180 --> 28:52.266
musicians, you know, they had accordions and 
everything. But the top stoop of the ship was for

28:52.286 --> 28:59.573
officers and nurses, see. Oh, I tell you, we wanted 
to talk to the girls too, you know, but off limits,

28:59.593 --> 29:05.398
can't do it. So we got to Melbourne, Australia. It 
took us fifteen days to go across, and we had one

29:09.810 --> 29:15.618
submarine scare. We were expecting a torpedo to 
hit from a Japanese submarine, but it never

29:17.701 --> 29:25.031
occurred. So we got into Melbourne, and there was 
no place for us to stay. They had a place called

29:35.197 --> 29:41.625
ASCOT, A-S-C-O-T, Speedway. And it was a 
racetrack, really. It was a stadium. And that's

29:48.574 --> 29:51.138
where we stayed. It was cold as hell, I tell you. 
See, the weather was the opposite from the States.

29:59.429 --> 30:02.132
And they got some cannabis. And they made some 
walls, windbreakers is what they were really,

30:03.192 --> 30:12.065
because the wind was coming in and it was chilly, I 
don't mean. And we'd sleep with our uniform and

30:13.167 --> 30:20.678
overcoat to keep warm. And so finally we got our 
orders to move up. Now we have Australia,

30:26.787 --> 30:31.815
I guess you already know Austria has a province or a 
state, and the gauge of the railroad is one width.

30:42.447 --> 30:46.674
And when you get to the border to go into the other, 
the gauge changes. I said, my God. So we had to

30:49.318 --> 30:55.387
unload everything, trucks and everything, drive 
along, and get on one or the other train. And then

30:56.648 --> 30:59.052
they had to stop. and the engineer or somebody up in 
the front came out with a can of oil
