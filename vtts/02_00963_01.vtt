WEBVTT

00:01.027 --> 00:13.106
...concerning

00:01.027 --> 00:13.106
the Vietnam War. In the interest of accumulating 
knowledge about the war, I'm going to donate this

00:13.126 --> 00:22.642
tape to the Texas A&M Oral History Collection in 
the University Archives. Is this alright with

00:22.662 --> 00:23.964
you? Yes.

00:34.827 --> 00:36.750
When and where were you born? I was born in 1962 at 
Saigon, South Vietnam. Do you have any brothers or

00:41.878 --> 00:43.521
sisters? Yes, I do have two brothers. Are they 
older, younger? They're younger than me. And are

00:48.929 --> 00:49.811
they here? Yes, they're over here. What are your 
memories of the old government, of the Saigon

00:53.136 --> 00:57.323
government? What do you remember about it? Or what 
do you remember from people telling you when you

01:00.089 --> 01:06.900
were young, or your own opinions? It's not a very 
good government. They just wasting the money.

01:26.029 --> 01:27.592
How do you remember the people being treated? 
There's two ways to treat people in Vietnam.

01:30.008 --> 01:49.308
differently

01:30.008 --> 01:49.308
than the school

01:30.008 --> 01:49.308
people. Like, they had all the lectures? Yes. What 
did your father do? My father was a teacher. Oh,

01:56.295 --> 01:56.815
like a school teacher? Yeah, he was a philosophy 
teacher. Oh, okay. Is he here? Yes, he's over here.

01:58.397 --> 01:58.497
Okay. So, did your whole family come over? Yes, my 
whole family. What did

02:00.215 --> 02:13.827
you think of the American soldiers?

02:17.391 --> 02:19.893
Did you know why they were there? I mean, what were 
your feelings about them being there? Well, I knew

02:25.778 --> 02:29.422
they were over here to fight, to help us fight the 
Communists, but they also bring some very bad

02:25.778 --> 02:29.422
influences without exception. For example? 
Like? Like,

02:31.378 --> 02:43.740
uh,

02:31.378 --> 02:43.740
prostitution, drugs. Okay. So,

02:43.880 --> 02:49.550
you say that's why you blame that on the Americans? 
You think they started that? Um, uh, in another

02:50.172 --> 02:50.813
way, yeah. Okay. Um, why did your family feel they 
had to leave you? Did they feel they had no choice?

03:01.148 --> 03:03.271
Yes, we had no choice. We had to get out because we 
cannot live with the comrades anymore. In what

03:12.586 --> 03:13.507
year did you leave? In 1980. How did you escape? We 
escaped on a small boat. Was it just your family or

03:15.911 --> 03:17.113
were you with other people? It was a small boat and 
it carried 79 people. We

03:19.358 --> 03:33.179
traveled for seven days on the South China Sea. And 
when you say a small boat, like... It's about 12

03:35.282 --> 03:36.063
yards long, three yards. And what about food? What 
did you eat? The food supplies only lasted for two

03:38.327 --> 03:40.090
days. And the water, I don't remember, it was about 
three or four days. But we survived it. when we was

03:49.058 --> 04:02.794
dropped by the pirates. They gave

04:02.814 --> 04:12.505
us some food and water every time. What do you mean 
pirates? Like the Thailand, the Thai fishmen. Oh,

04:13.907 --> 04:14.087
okay. They dropped us. I would think that was 
pretty scary. Oh, yeah. Can you tell me what you

04:15.389 --> 04:15.989
felt? Maybe you think you were going to make it? 
Well, when I left Vietnam, Bessie, Well, I think

04:19.535 --> 04:24.483
that, you know, I'm, I'm dead already. That's 
only, in ten, in a hundred percent, I only got ten

04:24.503 --> 04:32.276
percent, you know, five. So I wasn't, yeah. So it's 
all or nothing? It's all or nothing, yeah. Um, was

04:40.770 --> 04:41.952
this like all planned out, your escape? Like, was 
it?

04:45.758 --> 04:56.815
Yes, it was all playing out because we had to hide it

04:45.758 --> 04:56.815
away from the college. They would bother, they 
would put us in jail if they know that we tried to

04:57.156 --> 05:02.143
escape. That just seemed so, I bet you were 
paranoid. Yeah, our parents planned it, I just

05:06.190 --> 05:10.336
don't remember. But you knew what they were doing, 
right? Yeah.

05:17.348 --> 05:31.532
There was a free

05:17.348 --> 05:31.532
enterprise

05:17.348 --> 05:31.532
restriction in 1978. There's no free enterprise 
in Vietnam. Right, right. So what were your living

05:35.899 --> 05:37.722
conditions? They weren't too good, were they? No, 
the living condition is bad. How were they

05:39.766 --> 05:40.487
compared to before?

05:44.045 --> 05:58.406
Yes, the communists

05:44.045 --> 05:58.406
control everything.

06:00.188 --> 06:04.615
Rice is the

06:00.188 --> 06:04.615
main food. And they control it. And meat, they 
control it. Diarrhea and all kinds of that, they

06:06.558 --> 06:08.901
will control it. They will give us an amount each 
month. Ration. Yeah, ration. And I mean, it wasn't

06:10.163 --> 06:11.365
enough. No, it's not. How big is your family? We 
have five people in our family. So your parents and

06:12.847 --> 06:13.748
your brothers.

06:17.221 --> 06:29.252
But

06:17.221 --> 06:29.252
you say they've changed a lot since then, your 
living conditions. What do you say? No, I didn't

06:32.675 --> 06:33.676
say they changed. Oh, you don't think they've 
changed since then? No, I don't think so. It's

06:38.080 --> 06:38.621
still that way. No, I mean now, your own. Not for the 
people still in Vietnam. Oh, right now, over here?

06:40.543 --> 06:40.823
Right, uh-huh. I mean, you would usually say you 
have it better now? Yes, it's better over here in

06:41.964 --> 06:46.148
the United States and America. When

06:47.360 --> 07:01.959
you

06:47.360 --> 07:01.959
were on the boat, how did you get to America? Were 
you

07:01.979 --> 07:12.372
planning to get to America?

07:12.392 --> 07:14.475
No, we planned to go to Thailand or Malaysia with 
our boat because there's some refugee camp over

07:12.392 --> 07:14.475
there. I stayed in refugee camp in Thailand for six 
months and then I went to the United States. How did

07:16.417 --> 07:17.198
you get to the United States?

07:25.548 --> 07:46.816
So

07:25.548 --> 07:46.816
you

07:25.548 --> 07:46.816
said

07:25.548 --> 07:46.816
your uncle was your sponsor? How long have you been 
here? Since 1935. Oh, okay. What were your first

07:47.857 --> 07:49.719
thoughts of the United States when you got here? So 
big. Big? What were you told about the United

07:50.000 --> 07:51.802
States before you even knew you were going to be 
here? What were your impressions of it? And

07:54.843 --> 08:17.007
do

07:54.843 --> 08:17.007
you believe that now since you're here? Yes. How 
have your thoughts changed over time, like about

08:17.127 --> 08:18.849
America? Do you think it's all what it's made out to 
be? You know, when people tell you that you can do

08:20.991 --> 08:22.673
this and you can go for that. You

08:23.362 --> 08:33.772
know, apple pie, you know? Well, my thought hasn't 
changed that much. Only that I recognize there's

08:38.137 --> 08:45.764
some limited to the capitalism. Can you explain 
further on that? Like if you have too much freedom,

08:46.445 --> 08:51.310
you can see that the crime strike is going up so much 
because the prison I didn't get punished. for the

08:52.015 --> 08:57.322
crime that they act, that they commit. So in 
Vietnam, they would have gotten? Yes. And I think

09:01.708 --> 09:02.369
I'm against it. I don't know why we put so many 
people on the death row, just wasting tax money

09:02.609 --> 09:17.709
to cheat them and have to go through a lot of appeals 
and appeals and appeals. I don't know why. Yeah, I

09:18.530 --> 09:20.433
don't understand that either. It makes me mad too. 
Yeah. I know exactly what you mean. Yeah. How

09:23.251 --> 09:37.650
have people

09:23.251 --> 09:37.650
treated you since you've been here? Uh, very

09:37.670 --> 09:43.237
nice. Except, you know, one or two occasions that 
they've been through, but so far, very nice. Like,

09:47.643 --> 09:48.384
so have you experienced racism? Yes, I have. Would 
you say blatantly? Um, about two years ago or so.

09:49.785 --> 09:50.166
What happened? It's, uh, I was working in a 
restaurant and

09:54.183 --> 09:59.290
They wouldn't teach you? No, I was working

09:59.310 --> 10:10.824
and they were a customer. Oh, you were working 
then? Yeah. And they said something to you? Yeah,

10:16.391 --> 10:17.513
they would all kind of ignore people on the floor. 
Oh yeah, that's understand, so you know. Where did

10:18.354 --> 10:19.195
you go to high school? Okay. In

10:21.921 --> 10:41.370
Vietnam,

10:21.921 --> 10:41.370
I went to

10:21.921 --> 10:41.370
a

10:21.921 --> 10:41.370
high school in Vietnam, and over here I went to 
Bryan Island. So you came to Dallas when you got

10:41.390 --> 10:42.191
here? Right away? Yes. That's where your uncle 
goes? Yes. How were you treated in high school,

10:43.253 --> 10:44.595
among other Canadian students? Pretty nice. You 
were? That's great. And so how did you get to A&M?

10:51.659 --> 11:06.220
Yeah,

10:51.659 --> 11:06.220
I'd like to get into engineering too, but I won't do 
anything. If you were in Vietnam, do you think

11:06.240 --> 11:16.014
you'd be going to school? No. Engineering degree? 
No, no way. No, not at all? Not at all. What do you

11:18.217 --> 11:18.878
think you'd be doing? I don't know. Go out, find a 
job, get out of Vietnam as quick as I can. Just to get

11:20.340 --> 11:21.261
out of there, not even stay there. How

11:22.962 --> 11:44.846
are

11:22.962 --> 11:44.846
you treated at A&M? Do you think it's, is it any 
different in a college atmosphere? Uh, no. No.

11:47.589 --> 11:47.689
Okay. Um, do you feel people stereotype you since 
you are Oriental background? Sometimes. And do

11:49.711 --> 11:51.113
you think so more at A&M on a more of an intellectual 
level? Do you think they single you out and

11:53.945 --> 12:17.556
say, oh, you're Oriental and you're so smart and 
that's all you ever do is study? Do you feel that?

12:17.937 --> 12:17.997
No. No, I don't. No? What are your thoughts of 
Vietnam today when you think about it? Sad. Sad?

12:21.241 --> 12:21.862
Would you ever want to go back? Yeah, I would like to 
go back if there was no more communists over there.

12:23.476 --> 12:39.645
Do

12:23.476 --> 12:39.645
you still have friends over there? Yes, I do have 
friends over there. Do you keep in touch with them?

12:43.311 --> 12:43.532
Not lately. What's not lately? Well, since about 
six months ago, I don't know what happened to them.

12:45.775 --> 12:46.096
All of a sudden? Yeah, all of a sudden they just 
stopped. Probably the stamp price went up too

12:46.938 --> 12:47.779
much. When you did correspond

12:48.299 --> 12:58.831
with them, did they say they wanted to leave? You 
cannot say it because they will answer on their

12:58.851 --> 13:00.873
own. But did you feel like in their writing that 
they probably were not happy? Oh, yes. What do you

13:08.362 --> 13:12.327
think of Americans?

13:12.347 --> 13:17.232
Well, like all the countries, they got good people 
and they got bad people. Right. Do you think...

13:18.758 --> 13:25.904
Americans

13:18.758 --> 13:25.904
are forward?

13:33.510 --> 13:34.011
Not really. You think they're just real curious? 
Yes, I'm

13:37.794 --> 13:41.797
very curious. Yeah. What do you think of, say, 
American women compared to Vietnamese women? Do

13:44.119 --> 13:45.340
you think that... They are more material. 
American women? Yeah. But it's not changing. The

13:48.813 --> 14:04.435
second generation of Vietnamese people over here 
is... Materialistic as well? They get

14:05.817 --> 14:06.638
Americanized. Okay, that's what I've been 
asking. I'm from Austria. And that's where I was

14:09.141 --> 14:11.665
born. And I'm an Austrian citizen. And I've lived 
here since I was born. And, you know, people ask me,

14:13.207 --> 14:15.951
you know, why don't you get the American 
citizenship? Or why, you know, you're

14:15.971 --> 14:17.152
Americanized too. And I say, well... No, I'm not 
American. I'm Americanized. Do you feel you're

14:21.581 --> 14:25.828
Americanized? Or do you feel... No, I think I'm 
still... I'm in an old-fashioned way. I'm still

14:30.595 --> 14:33.319
conservative. Conservative? Yeah. But do you 
feel you've grown to have more American views

14:33.800 --> 14:42.813
than... Well, I've been Americanized, but not as 
much as other people. Like what example? Like

14:44.336 --> 14:45.297
about... What do you think about

14:46.576 --> 14:58.155
women working? Do you think women should work? Or 
should stay at home? No, if a husband cannot

15:05.026 --> 15:08.712
support the whole family, the woman should go 
ahead and help out. Do you think your views are

15:09.433 --> 15:11.196
different than if you had stayed in Vietnam? Yes, 
because in Vietnam usually the husband is

15:11.216 --> 15:13.680
working, the wife is staying home working. Well, 
what if you were in Vietnam and

15:14.133 --> 15:28.727
you couldn't support your family? I wouldn't get 
married. You wouldn't get married? No. Okay,

15:31.710 --> 15:32.070
interesting. You wouldn't tell

15:32.090 --> 15:41.279
your wife to go get a job? No, I can't. You can't? 
It's against the tradition. Okay. Do you want to

15:42.460 --> 15:43.041
say something? Yeah. How have your goals

15:44.069 --> 15:55.023
changed? Or your values? Have they changed at all? 
Do you have a feeling that

16:00.429 --> 16:09.921
you could probably go after it and go for more than 
if you stayed in Vietnam? I really don't know. What

16:10.381 --> 16:11.663
are your feelings about having

16:12.149 --> 16:28.826
diplomatic

16:12.149 --> 16:28.826
relations

16:12.149 --> 16:28.826
with Vietnam now? Do you think America should and 
shouldn't, but not? Yeah, I'm against it. Why?

16:33.310 --> 16:35.953
Well, because you cannot trust communist people. 
You know, in front they will say something, but in

16:35.973 --> 16:38.115
the back they will do something else. They will 
never keep the promise. But do you think if there

16:38.816 --> 16:40.958
would be diplomatic relations, do you think it 
would be a better quality of life for the

16:41.663 --> 16:45.008
Vietnamese people? No. Because if we have 
diplomatic relations with the communists, all

16:46.490 --> 16:56.905
the people who we get to benefit from it is the top 
people. Who are already getting better. Yeah,

16:58.788 --> 17:03.775
they will get better.

17:07.260 --> 17:09.624
Unless, you know, there's no communists, there's 
no way we can do it. What's your opinion of

17:09.644 --> 17:10.405
Gorbachev? Well, he's right now, he got a very big 
trouble

17:11.617 --> 17:25.137
because he got the separation of power in the 
Politburo. And right now he's trying to eliminate

17:25.197 --> 17:29.323
his opponent. Do you think he means what he says by 
his blasphemous and perestroika? Well, he would

17:33.389 --> 17:38.957
show off something, but he would not go at it 
completely. He would show the free country and

17:39.848 --> 18:00.180
say,

17:39.848 --> 18:00.180
okay,

17:39.848 --> 18:00.180
I'm going to do that. I'll show you the start, but he 
would never finish. I don't really have any more

18:01.242 --> 18:02.784
questions, but you've been here eight years now? 
Yeah, eight and a half. And,

18:04.250 --> 18:10.918
I mean, you like it here? It's okay. It's okay? 
College Station's okay, or would you rather be

18:12.200 --> 18:20.309
back in... I would rather be back in Vietnam. Oh, 
you would? Of course, under different

18:21.331 --> 18:22.252
circumstances. What do you miss the most?

18:28.399 --> 18:30.662
A lot of taste in the air. Like, I'm

18:30.895 --> 18:42.491
sure

18:30.895 --> 18:42.491
you miss your friends, and... That's one thing. 
You miss, like, some of the food, or... Well,

18:42.511 --> 18:45.816
food... I don't know, it's just the feeling that 
you were born with. Mm-hmm. And, uh, it's never go

18:48.480 --> 18:49.041
away. Mm-hmm. It's still inside you somewhere. 
Yeah, it's your home. Yeah. Right, yeah. I don't

18:51.985 --> 18:54.268
even know what to say. Um... Do you want

18:56.326 --> 19:12.190
to

18:56.326 --> 19:12.190
be an American citizen? I am an American citizen. 
Oh, you are? All right. Yeah, I got the citizenship

19:13.672 --> 19:15.155
four years ago. Oh. Well, how's that feeling? How 
do you feel about it? Well, not very

19:16.336 --> 19:20.543
happy with it. No, because you had to give up your 
native language? Yeah, but I think it's good for me

19:21.624 --> 19:25.270
because I can use it to try to do something over here 
that I'd be able to do. What

19:26.532 --> 19:49.094
do

19:26.532 --> 19:49.094
you think about

19:26.532 --> 19:49.094
what President Bush, or I guess the election 
process here?

19:51.396 --> 19:53.018
Do you think it's more of a kind of personality 
election? It takes the people who have the best

19:53.038 --> 19:55.560
personalities and what they really stand for? Or 
do you like

19:56.384 --> 20:17.673
the way? What I think is the media controls too 
much. The what? The media. The media, oh,

20:19.015 --> 20:19.936
definitely. We get so much information from the 
media, so we can never tell the truth. Like, I don't

20:21.458 --> 20:23.301
know, they get good qualifications, but somehow 
we get blow up so much. Yeah. You

20:24.397 --> 20:41.122
said you're

20:24.397 --> 20:41.122
engineering,

20:24.397 --> 20:41.122
right? Yes. Are you a graduate student now, or are 
you still your undergrad? I'm still undergrad.

20:44.427 --> 20:45.008
And when are you finished? I don't know. I plan to 
finish in late 1990. Do you like that? That's a good

20:48.213 --> 20:48.814
idea, isn't it? Yes. You mean you're ready to be 
finished? Yes, I'm ready. Did you know you always

20:50.196 --> 20:51.518
wanted to be an engineering major?

20:57.202 --> 20:58.423
Uh, yeah.

21:14.161 --> 21:17.004
I don't know what you're talking about. Yeah, be a 
congressman. A politician? Yeah, a politician.

21:18.205 --> 21:18.345
Really? Yeah, I would like to be a congressman. 
Really? If I have a chance. Uh-huh. You could go

21:22.009 --> 21:22.570
work in Austin. Work in Austin, you know, in the 
capital. Uh, yeah, maybe. Or you already have

21:23.791 --> 21:24.492
bigger... plans to go right to Washington? Oh, no, 
no, that's too big.

21:38.330 --> 21:38.510
Oh, okay. But right now I just want to get together 
with some groups, Vietnamese groups, and try to do

21:38.530 --> 21:45.458
as much as I can. What do you want to do? What do you 
think needs to be done? Why should I vote for you if

21:48.902 --> 21:53.467
you're going to be a politician? What would you say 
with your platform? platform is, I'm going to

21:55.825 --> 22:08.838
reform the judicial system over here.

22:09.519 --> 22:12.922
It's a lot of nonsense in there. And I would try to 
speed up the... Not let it sit on death row for so

22:13.363 --> 22:18.728
long? Yeah. And I would like to speed up the 
bureaucratic movement. Like, you have too many

22:21.211 --> 22:22.292
departments, too many people. You have to go

22:26.251 --> 22:42.225
That's

22:26.251 --> 22:42.225
a lot

22:26.251 --> 22:42.225
of wasting right there. Thank you. I agree with a 
lot of you, actually. How would it be looked at in

22:47.210 --> 22:53.035
your culture or in your family if you were to date an 
American girl? Or would you even consider that?

22:54.677 --> 22:56.038
Well, I know my family were against it. Do you 
consider that interracial? Like some people, you

23:02.902 --> 23:11.513
know, black and white, they're interracial. Some 
people are strongly against that. Some people

23:15.338 --> 23:15.798
don't care. Yeah, a lot of Vietnamese people are 
like that. To me, it's okay. It doesn't bother you?

23:18.882 --> 23:19.042
No. Would you do that? If I can find the right 
person, right girl. I

23:22.951 --> 23:39.012
know I would find one, but I don't know. You're not 
looking

23:39.533 --> 23:43.698
for anybody, right? No. Do you have a girlfriend 
now? Yes, I do. Vietnamese

23:47.605 --> 24:02.038
culture is a different

23:47.605 --> 24:02.038
culture than American. What would you say is the 
biggest difference? That if you did date an

24:05.742 --> 24:08.944
American girl, what would she have to get used to, 
do you think? Vietnamese people are more

24:08.964 --> 24:10.045
conservative. Like, they don't like to see a girl 
going to the bar and drinking. Oh, so she wouldn't,

24:14.149 --> 24:15.090
she shouldn't do that. Yeah, and they are against. 
But you can do that? Can you? Guys, it's okay. Guys,

24:19.956 --> 24:21.157
it's alright. But the girls can't go do it. Well, 
no. Well, do you think that's kind of unfair there?

24:26.825 --> 24:28.006
I know. But... You think so? Yeah. Oh, okay. Like, 
they are against,

24:32.932 --> 24:43.225
like, pre-marriage,

24:32.932 --> 24:43.225
though, right? Uh-huh. Well, I'm sure that's not 
the statement you'd put for a lot of people. So,

24:45.268 --> 24:46.249
would your family be strongly against you? Yeah. 
Marrying, or? Do

24:47.225 --> 25:11.797
you have anything else that you just want to say? 
No, no. If you have any questions, I'll answer

25:11.978 --> 25:12.859
them. Yeah, I'm trying to think. Do you think 
school is tough? No, no. If you put, if you

25:14.180 --> 25:15.342
determine to go get it, you can get it. Do

25:16.081 --> 25:30.539
you want it bad enough? How is the school system in 
Vietnam? It's more like a French system. So, like

25:37.127 --> 25:45.377
compared to freshman high school together, 
Vietnam with the American, I think the Vietnam

25:37.127 --> 25:45.377
people have more knowledge. Especially math. The 
American people

25:46.574 --> 26:03.072
is too, they don't,

25:46.574 --> 26:03.072
they don't

25:46.574 --> 26:03.072
empathize with the mass. I guess, Oriental people 
are always looked at to seem like, it seems like

26:03.273 --> 26:11.722
they are very smart and they are very hard workers 
in their school work. Are you just brought up from

26:12.162 --> 26:14.505
home? You're going to be doing this so many hours? 
We've been doing it in Vietnam. We have class three

26:22.576 --> 26:25.780
days a week. We have class six days a week. 
Saturday, too? Yeah, Saturday, too. If I have

26:30.646 --> 26:40.259
physics, I have three days a week and

26:30.646 --> 26:40.259
one hour, two hours every day, two hours each day. 
If you have a lesson on Monday, you have to memorize

26:40.279 --> 26:44.104
that lesson to Recite

26:44.371 --> 26:54.047
it

26:44.371 --> 26:54.047
to the teacher. Be ready to recite

26:54.067 --> 27:03.803
it to the teacher on Wednesday. You have to do it 
every day like that. So it's getting through your

27:05.545 --> 27:06.247
brain. So you can't get the day, huh? No way. Well, 
it's like, keeps you on your feet. Yeah. See, the

27:08.210 --> 27:10.073
homework, we have homework too, but we have to 
recite it, what he teaches us. You know, he'll call

27:10.093 --> 27:11.475
me, and then he'll give me. If you don't remember

27:11.742 --> 27:23.241
anything, that's a zero. We have more 
competition. At the end of each month, we vote for

27:26.305 --> 27:32.215
who is the best student.

27:38.236 --> 27:44.866
And it's boys and girls in the classroom, right? I 
would think it's not as social as I think it is

27:44.886 --> 27:58.848
here in America. No, it's not as social. It's not? 
What is it like? What do young people do in Vietnam?

28:01.052 --> 28:02.054
You mean after 75 or before? No, I mean like after 
school? After school, they go home and have the

28:02.975 --> 28:04.918
parents out.

28:16.559 --> 28:22.848
Where are your parents now? Are they in Dallas?

28:30.599 --> 28:34.064
And what does your father do now? He's an 
electrical technician. And your mother? She's a

28:35.987 --> 28:36.287
tailor. Do you think they've changed since 
they've been here? Not very much. Do they still

28:40.794 --> 28:41.655
like to go back to Vietnam?

28:47.862 --> 29:06.527
So,

28:47.862 --> 29:06.527
when you have children,

28:47.862 --> 29:06.527
would you like them to... I would assume that most 
likely they'd be born in America, the children,

29:06.547 --> 29:14.978
but would you want them to know Vietnam? Sure, I 
would raise them to Vietnamese language. What is

29:16.681 --> 29:16.941
that? Let

29:17.326 --> 29:42.293
them know, you know, try to let them speak 
Vietnamese, learn to write, and know about our

29:17.326 --> 29:42.293
culture, our history. Sure, that's important. 
Yeah. Well, I think... I don't think there's

29:43.254 --> 29:43.974
anything else. I can't think of anything. Did you 
look at other

29:46.908 --> 30:00.291
schools before you came to A&M? No, UT and Rice. And 
you didn't like A&M? Rice was too much for me. I

30:08.485 --> 30:08.846
can't afford it. But UT, I don't like it. You don't 
like it? How come? I don't know. I just don't know.

30:10.609 --> 30:10.669
No? Too many people? Or just the school? Just the 
school. So do you have to pay for school yourself?

30:17.115 --> 30:19.618
Or are you a parent? No, I got a

30:19.638 --> 30:27.350
power bank and I work to support myself. I bet 
that's hard though, going to work and school at the

30:27.370 --> 30:31.937
same time. Because I know, I'm an only child and my 
parents totally, fully support me. And I have a lot

30:35.543 --> 30:39.108
of friends that work and go to school. And I have a 
friend who works and he goes to school. You know, he

30:43.439 --> 30:54.691
has to support himself totally. And I know that 
would be really hard. You

30:58.816 --> 31:06.184
know, that's very stressful. Do you think it's a 
lot of stress? Yes, it is. It adds. Especially if

31:07.325 --> 31:08.026
you have a family. I know I have a couple friends 
that I will marry and try to go to school and support

31:08.046 --> 31:10.028
themselves. Do you have to help out your family at 
the same time? No, no.

31:16.784 --> 31:18.441
Okay, it worked.
