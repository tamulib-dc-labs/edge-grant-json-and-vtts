00:04.182 --> 00:20.344
As I was saying that Guy Warren, the president of 
Chamber of Commerce, had the good sense to appoint

00:04.182 --> 00:20.344
Mr. Lon C. Hill, who was president of the power 
company, Central Power and Light Company. And his

00:22.326 --> 00:32.620
company took the position that Corpus Christi is 
the prime city of their system. and was destined to

00:33.798 --> 00:55.647
go places and expand and be a big city and be a big 
market for their power, they gave him an unlimited

00:33.798 --> 00:55.647
expense account that he could use in connection 
with working with the Area Development

00:33.798 --> 00:55.647
Committee. And he used it very effectively. He 
would have luncheons for these various

00:59.172 --> 01:02.556
committees particularly the subcommittee, the 
working committee. He would get them together and

01:07.703 --> 01:12.009
tell them this is what we want to do and how to do it. 
And he did it in a very good-natured way, but very

01:13.251 --> 01:17.958
firm. I recall one time he took us in the CPNL 
boardroom. We had a serious problem to settle

01:25.088 --> 01:30.636
between the city and the county and the navigation 
district. And he says, I want you three fellas or

01:32.067 --> 01:37.795
you three agencies to get in this room and start 
talking. And as he went out, he says, now, I'm going

01:39.017 --> 01:41.080
to lock the door. And when you come to an answer, 
I'll unlock the door and let you in or let you out.

01:46.808 --> 01:49.312
Well, it was good natured he wouldn't do it. But 
after we got through, he took us out to dinner, and

01:49.352 --> 01:53.859
we solved the problem. But that's the kind of an 
atmosphere we had to work with. And it was very

01:59.086 --> 02:00.268
effective.

02:03.083 --> 02:22.711
Well, when this report was published, the Area 
Development Committee, the Comprehensive Plan,

02:03.083 --> 02:22.711
it was called, for Corpus Christi area, the Area 
Development Committee, at their expense, had a

02:03.083 --> 02:22.711
big banquet. They filled the biggest hotel room 
that they had and invited all of the citizens

02:22.811 --> 02:32.905
committees and all the leaders, the Area 
Development Committee, and their wives. And it

02:38.277 --> 02:43.622
was the Driscoll Hotel at that time. And they had a 
very large ballroom. We never had one as big as that

02:49.329 --> 02:52.372
since. But they filled it. And the purpose was to 
present the community with the plan.

03:05.386 --> 03:12.617
So after the dinner, they got up. And they had 
Bartholomew explain the plan briefly. And then

03:17.965 --> 03:25.636
they called on each of the political leaders and 
said, now, you've been a part of this plan. You

03:26.477 --> 03:27.559
worked along with it. And it's going to be you 
that's going to carry it out, not the Area

03:28.921 --> 03:33.087
Development Committee. We're citizens. We've 
been willing to put up most of the money. The city

03:39.845 --> 03:44.070
and the county and the navigation district each 
put up $10,000. But otherwise, it was all

03:45.391 --> 03:47.453
citizens' money.

03:52.199 --> 03:56.984
So they called on each one of them to talk. Each one 
of them got up and said, now, we'll do our part. They

04:01.570 --> 04:03.692
even had a representative of the city the federal 
government there, congressmen, and the state

04:04.465 --> 04:14.077
representative. And I remember very well when 
they came around to the city, the mayor had been a

04:14.097 --> 04:23.829
member of this committee. I knew what was coming. 
So prior to this meeting, he had gotten past the

04:33.473 --> 04:40.781
largest bond issue that the city had ever

04:33.473 --> 04:40.781
passed. And it was all based on this plan. And he 
said, if it isn't in the plan, I don't want it in the

04:44.304 --> 04:47.187
bond issue. So when he got up and he said, well, 
here's our contribution. We've got so many

04:53.214 --> 05:01.202
million dollars already voted to carry out our 
part of the plan.

05:02.043 --> 05:05.466
And the other political leaders said the same 
thing. Now, this is quite a long ways to come from

05:07.688 --> 05:15.796
the time that we had this commission form of 
government. And there was political backbiting.

05:19.219 --> 05:22.202
And nobody wanted to do anything. And nobody would 
vote bonds. So based on the plan, they got the bond

05:27.066 --> 05:31.290
issue passed. And

05:32.333 --> 05:36.700
they went right to work on it. We built a dam right 
away, new water supply. We got busy on the bridge.

05:46.676 --> 05:54.348
It took a little while longer to get the airport 
problem worked out because it was a conflict with

05:46.676 --> 05:54.348
the military airspace. And we had to wait till that 
got cleared up. The State Highway Department went

06:01.122 --> 06:03.545
to work on a plan for a freeway system. And

06:05.247 --> 06:14.597
local citizens agreed to do their share in buying 
the right of way, in addition to what they had in

06:05.247 --> 06:14.597
this.

06:18.522 --> 06:28.513
The plan did have parallel streets, but these were 
modified. the State Highway Department offered

06:28.865 --> 06:31.187
the freeways. But it was all fit in with the plan.

06:38.655 --> 06:42.619
From time to time, there were minor 
modifications. But basically, the plan went on

06:42.719 --> 06:48.264
up. They did everything in the plan. And once we got 
started on implementing this plan, the citizens

06:51.287 --> 06:57.994
were impatient. They wanted it. They didn't want 
it on the 15 or 20 year schedule that we had. They

07:06.280 --> 07:07.561
wanted it faster than that. So we condensed it and 
still were able to finance it. And I

07:14.148 --> 07:26.380
had something else on that. On the freeways? Yeah, 
well,

07:28.552 --> 07:43.794
we implemented all parts of the plan

07:28.552 --> 07:43.794
very much as they were proposed. One example, in 
the school plan, the schools were generally

07:46.198 --> 07:56.753
located by using the system of circles. And the 
school administration were so anxious to have the

07:57.391 --> 08:10.307
schools located in the right place that they went 
out and bought the land that was at the center of the

07:57.391 --> 08:10.307
circle. And in a few instances, they were so 
conscientious about trying to put it in the right

08:12.149 --> 08:24.264
place that they bought land that was maybe not as 
suitable as maybe a block away would have been. It

08:24.324 --> 08:27.027
wasn't properly drained or something. But this 
was an attitude of their conscientiousness to do

08:27.631 --> 08:33.556
it according to the plan. As

08:33.616 --> 08:37.900
faithfully as possible. As faithfully as 
possible. And they did. And the one thing that was

08:41.844 --> 08:49.591
not implemented was urban renewal. This city was 
free enterprise. And there was a group, including

08:56.825 --> 09:13.462
some of the members of the Area Development 
Committee, that felt that this was socialistic

08:56.825 --> 09:13.462
and that they wouldn't subscribe to it. And they 
got a law passed in the legislature requiring a

09:13.482 --> 09:23.192
referendum

09:13.482 --> 09:23.192
for urban renewal to be undertaken. They had a 
referendum. And it failed four to one. So the only

09:31.565 --> 09:35.309
thing that was not implemented in the plan was the 
urban renewal.

09:38.071 --> 09:42.035
It was tried again two other times, and it failed 
each time. So this city was not oriented to urban

09:43.836 --> 09:46.258
renewal.

09:49.181 --> 09:55.907
I think it's appropriate to go back now and talk a 
little bit about our harbor and ship channel. As

09:57.035 --> 10:02.463
you know, the Gulf Coast here is subject to 
hurricanes. In 1919, we had a very serious

10:04.165 --> 10:20.729
hurricane here that virtually

10:04.165 --> 10:20.729
wiped off the development on an area north of the 
bridge called North Beach. A great many lives were

10:22.952 --> 10:25.776
lost.

10:29.435 --> 10:31.819
the city decided that they needed some 
protection. At the same time we were talking about

10:33.722 --> 10:48.466
building a harbor here, we had a ship channel that 
was a shallow channel that served the piers out in

10:33.722 --> 10:48.466
front of the town. But these were shallow draft 
vessels and

10:49.488 --> 10:55.898
were not adequate. The citizens here

10:57.886 --> 11:11.704
went to Congress and got this city designated for a 
deep harbor, a deep draft harbor. Congress passed

11:13.546 --> 11:20.254
it and then voted the funds to dig a deeper channel 
and to dig a deep harbor. This was completed in

11:21.256 --> 11:24.720
1926. at which time the Bascule Bridge was built.

11:31.415 --> 11:33.657
The harbor was much smaller than it is today. But in 
order to get this harbor, the community and the

11:35.859 --> 11:50.232
state had to provide a seawall protection in front 
of the city.

11:53.435 --> 11:56.158
The local citizens went to the legislature and got 
an act passed that was called tax remission. And it

12:02.380 --> 12:16.995
was for seven counties around here that all the 
state taxes would be remitted to a fund called the

12:02.380 --> 12:16.995
Seawall Protection Fund for Corpus Christi. At 
that time, the development around here was some

12:18.857 --> 12:26.145
farmland. But a lot of it was brush, and it was just 
coming into farmland, good productive farmland.

12:34.186 --> 12:35.647
And the taxes weren't very high. So this act didn't 
yield an awful lot of money. But it did yield enough

12:42.756 --> 12:48.823
that we could put a breakwater out in front of the 
city. And that is the breakwater that's out there

12:50.225 --> 12:53.128
now, those rocks. This satisfied the

12:55.589 --> 13:05.720
federal government of protection of the harbor. 
But as long about this time, I mentioned that we had

13:08.382 --> 13:18.173
discovered oil in this area and that the farmland 
is expanding rapidly. And we were producing a

13:18.233 --> 13:25.360
great deal of cotton, which was being shipped out 
of the new harbor And the taxes for this

13:26.622 --> 13:32.668
seven-county area increased substantially. So 
it was quite a bit of funds there available. The

13:39.075 --> 13:56.393
community then decided that they wanted a seawall 
in front of the city, and that

13:39.075 --> 13:56.393
Gutzon Borglum was a resident of Beeville. He made 
a plaster model for the seawall here and even

13:57.503 --> 14:09.758
offered to build a statue of Christ and give it to 
the city if they'd follow his model. For some

14:11.059 --> 14:13.062
reason, they didn't go along with that. But later 
on, they sent committees all over the United

14:14.503 --> 14:19.069
States looking at seawalls. They came back and 
decided what kind of a seawall they wanted. And

14:23.558 --> 14:27.542
they engaged a firm of engineers, and they went 
ahead and designed a seawall.

14:30.204 --> 14:44.377
And

14:30.204 --> 14:44.377
what they did with this seawall was to place it out 
into the bay, about a block or two blocks out into

14:30.204 --> 14:44.377
the bay. And then they filled the land behind the 
seawall with dredged material and created land.

14:56.224 --> 15:07.896
Some of this land went to the owners of the adjacent 
property for riparian rights, but about one block

14:56.224 --> 15:07.896
of it was left for public use. And this is what made 
the beautiful bayfront. The seawall was built and

15:16.285 --> 15:20.329
completed in 1941.

15:21.271 --> 15:22.733
just before World War II. Who did the work on it? Who 
did all the construction? Well, there was a local

15:28.741 --> 15:31.365
construction firm. It might have been Brown and 
Root. I'm not sure. Anyhow, the Meyers and Noyes

15:36.732 --> 15:40.798
were the engineers. It wasn't done then with the 
WPA labor? No. No, it was all contract. Because

15:48.023 --> 15:50.686
there's a rumor that that was done with WPA. No, 
there was no WPA. It was all done with bond money.

15:55.370 --> 15:57.792
No, all done with money from this fund. The special 
fund. They issued bonds on it, but they paid off

15:59.875 --> 16:08.343
these bonds from the revenue from this tax 
remission. And that was... finally paid off in

16:10.462 --> 16:19.833
about 1950, and the remission act was then 
repealed. We probably should mention that

16:21.295 --> 16:28.824
Goodson Borglum then went on to be the sculptor at 
Mount Rushmore. Yeah, yeah. I understand that the

16:30.847 --> 16:39.237
statue of Christ that was destined for, was 
offered to Corpus Christi went to Spearfish,

16:39.689 --> 16:43.154
South Dakota. South Dakota. Of course, Goodson 
Borglum all the time was working on Mount

16:45.698 --> 16:49.524
Rushmore.

16:52.128 --> 16:53.290
During that same period. During the same period. 
Now, after the war,

16:54.091 --> 17:08.633
this land between the, out in front of the, between 
the sea wall old shoreline that was owned by the

17:09.727 --> 17:18.760
public was undeveloped. It had a lot of shell and 
sand and wasn't very attractive and had no

17:20.022 --> 17:26.071
planning. So the city then,

17:27.773 --> 17:39.430
with the encouragement of the Chamber of 
Commerce, employed the landscape firm and city

17:27.773 --> 17:39.430
planning firm of Hare and Hare out of Kansas City to 
design the

17:40.051 --> 17:56.048
seawall, the landscaping on the seawall and the 
piers that were part of the seawall, the T-heads we

17:40.051 --> 17:56.048
call them. So the landscaping that is there is the 
result of the design that was made by the very

17:56.068 --> 18:09.062
famous landscape architectural firm of Hare and 
Hare.

18:12.434 --> 18:25.231
Since

18:12.434 --> 18:25.231
going back to the ship channel, the ship channel 
was extended several times. In about 1955,

18:26.913 --> 18:40.230
it was extended several miles.

18:41.392 --> 19:04.757
In connection with the Bascule Bridge Removal 
Project, the head of navigation in the ship

18:41.392 --> 19:04.757
channel, or the harbor, was extended about four 
miles up the

18:41.392 --> 19:04.757
channel. And the railroad bridge was built up at 
the upper part of the channel.

19:16.981 --> 19:34.638
As

19:16.981 --> 19:34.638
part of the land use plan, it

19:16.981 --> 19:34.638
was conceived that the industry all ought to be on 
the north side of the city near the ship channel.

19:36.200 --> 19:36.841
Two reasons. One, the prevailing wind was from the 
southeast, and it blew the industrial odors away

19:46.597 --> 19:48.559
from the city if it was over there. Also that we 
wanted the Bayfront to be kept clean and most of it

19:50.581 --> 20:12.206
in public ownership for use of recreation and the 
beauty of the Bayfront. This is all part of the land

20:12.226 --> 20:14.308
use plan that was included in the area development 
plan. And the city has adhered to it remarkably

20:19.634 --> 20:25.322
well.

20:29.548 --> 20:33.694
One of the problems that Corpus Christi had was 
drainage. Fortunately, most of the city is 14 feet

20:34.976 --> 20:41.325
or above except for the downtown area and on Corpus 
Christi Beach. But strangely enough, the slope of

20:46.912 --> 21:10.958
the land above was away from the bay so that in order 
to drain the land on which the city was to be built,

20:46.912 --> 21:10.958
it was necessary to dig channels that would go 
through the bluff and into the bay.

21:19.231 --> 21:31.341
Four or five large channels were built,

21:19.231 --> 21:31.341
Louisiana, Carmel Parkway, and a couple of 
others. Now these were wide and originally were

21:32.482 --> 21:41.350
open ditches, but as the city developed, the 
ditches were not acceptable. And large boxes,

21:49.077 --> 21:55.664
concrete boxes, were placed in these ditches to 
carry off the water. And all the feeder drainage

21:57.045 --> 22:10.780
was funneled into these big channels and big boxes 
and shunted into the bay. In some cases, they were

22:12.447 --> 22:17.493
several hundred feet wide. They were covered and 
landscaped and made recreation areas. So as a

22:24.500 --> 22:38.876
result, you'll find several areas in the city that 
have wide open spaces

22:24.500 --> 22:38.876
running towards the bay. It gives an openness to 
the area. developed part of the city. Has that

22:45.243 --> 22:46.544
system worked well? It has worked perfectly. How 
about during hurricanes? We have no problems

22:51.769 --> 22:53.931
during hurricanes. We're above the high point. 
The only problem that we've had was in the downtown

22:57.915 --> 23:02.319
area. After the seawall was built, the seawall was 
higher than the main business district. So as part

23:13.113 --> 23:25.911
of the seawall construction, a large drainage box 
sewer, storm sewer, was placed in Water Street.

23:27.733 --> 23:39.230
And all of the water that falls in this area goes 
into this big drainage box. And at either end, one

23:39.250 --> 23:42.394
on the north end and one on the south end, There are 
large pumps, a series of large pumps, that will

23:43.572 --> 24:05.426
pump this water out even though the water in the bay 
is higher than the

23:43.572 --> 24:05.426
land in the downtown district. The pumps are 
strong enough to pump against the hydraulic head

24:05.446 --> 24:10.153
of the bay. And we've never had any serious 
problem.

24:23.607 --> 24:30.873
One time, one of the pumps got stuck and wouldn't 
pump water out. And enough rainfall came in that

24:32.175 --> 24:38.841
the water got up to the door sills.

24:39.412 --> 24:45.659
The council was very much perturbed and made sure 
that the pumps were in good working order. They

24:46.740 --> 24:54.369
start those pumps and run them every few days to 
make sure that they have proper operating for them

24:46.740 --> 24:54.369
all year round.

24:58.453 --> 25:09.165
Well, you take that railroad line that goes out of 
San Antonio, goes to Del Rio. Now, every so often

25:10.782 --> 25:16.769
along there, they had a little town where they had a 
water plant. They had a water tank. When they got to

25:20.394 --> 25:32.288
Uvalde, they laid it out, 300-foot square blocks 
centered around the railroad station, laid out by

25:20.394 --> 25:32.288
the railroad engineers. But it was the city. You 
take DeHannis. And a whole bunch of those little

25:40.988 --> 25:46.376
cities all along there, they were all laid out the 
same way. And they're there now. Well, this is

25:48.960 --> 25:56.091
analogous to the Illinois experience of the 
Illinois Central Railroad, laying out all the

25:48.960 --> 25:56.091
towns. Sure. Sure they did. Well, we got that. Now, 
we got that up in West Texas, too. A lot of those

26:04.945 --> 26:08.430
cities out there were laid out by the railroads.

26:13.220 --> 26:15.423
But those were engineers, not planners. Yeah, but 
they didn't have planners then. No. They were the

26:22.052 --> 26:23.193
planners. Whatever it is, they were responsible 
for shaping our city, our towns. Well, then, after

26:31.825 --> 26:41.758
that initial era was over, then a lot of planning 
was done for the small cities of Texas with

26:31.825 --> 26:41.758
consultants and Well, the 701s, you mean. Later 
the 701s. But nothing was done before the 701s?

26:49.418 --> 26:52.763
Very little.

26:52.783 --> 26:57.209
Hare and Hare did something in Wichita Falls. Yes.

27:02.136 --> 27:08.725
There

27:02.136 --> 27:08.725
was something done in Austin.

27:11.962 --> 27:21.176
Well, George Kresser did a lot of work up there in 
Fort Worth, some in Dallas, laying out the parkway

27:11.962 --> 27:21.176
system. I don't know what he did in El Paso. I'm not 
familiar with that. He did a general plan in 1925.

27:27.666 --> 27:29.629
Well, Bartholomew did something there, too, one 
time.

27:32.673 --> 27:41.226
Another element

27:32.673 --> 27:41.226
in the development of our cities

27:42.134 --> 27:45.558
speculative developers. There were a whole lot of 
them. They would, over here at Rockport and that

27:48.021 --> 28:00.595
area, they laid out miles and miles of area with 
streets. What they would do, they would lay out the

28:02.357 --> 28:11.027
town with lots in the town, and then they'd bring 
people down here by train. snowbirds. They would

28:15.163 --> 28:21.989
put them in the train and then run them by and show 
them it. And they actually brought in fruit trees

28:22.909 --> 28:29.195
and tied on grapefruit. And so that when they went 
by, they said, see, look at the grapefruit. But it

28:34.179 --> 28:37.803
was tremendous promotion like that. And what they 
would do And it created a great many problems. And I

28:44.118 --> 28:46.862
know because I've done some work up in Rockport. 
They would sell a lot in town to one of these people

28:48.083 --> 28:54.793
they'd bring down here on the train. And then 
they'd give them, I think it was a five-acre tract

28:55.935 --> 29:05.509
out on the edge of town in the brush. So they sold 
these things all over the world. And so when you

29:13.090 --> 29:26.183
want to develop any area around there, you've got 
all the title problems of these people that own

29:13.090 --> 29:26.183
these little five-acre tracts. And they're out of 
town. It sounds like the Florida boom did it. You

29:34.212 --> 29:37.975
can't assemble a tract of land large enough to 
really do any good with.

29:41.919 --> 29:42.540
Summing up. The

29:43.938 --> 30:11.734
first comprehensive plan, it is rather 
remarkable that a city that had been mainly a

29:43.938 --> 30:11.734
tourist center or a resort center was just coming 
into an industrial

29:43.938 --> 30:11.734
city

30:12.389 --> 30:35.646
building of the ship channel and the discovery of 
oil, that the leaders of the community could get

30:12.389 --> 30:35.646
together and

30:12.389 --> 30:35.646
establish a city manager form of government, and 
in so doing, provided the necessary charter

30:36.368 --> 30:43.576
provisions for the establishment of an official 
planning commission. And in addition to that, the

30:45.678 --> 31:04.519
leaders, the economic leaders, the political 
leaders, and a great many of the citizens were able

30:45.678 --> 31:04.519
to come together and unite in

31:05.832 --> 31:13.939
preparing a comprehensive plan for the city.

31:19.804 --> 31:34.337
The plan was technically very well done, but in 
addition, the plan provided for the means of

31:19.804 --> 31:34.337
financing it And...
