00:02.714 --> 00:12.552
With Dr. Greenhut, I remember his chuckling later 
that Mr. Rutter gave him a long lecture about not

00:02.714 --> 00:12.552
bringing in a bunch of conservatives. The 
Department of Economics that I knew when I first

00:13.894 --> 00:24.233
got here was very high in quality of its 
instruction here. They were really good at the

00:24.415 --> 00:31.652
undergraduate and master's level, but then here 
came this group of senior scholars. The funding

00:32.173 --> 00:38.669
for that was from normal A&M sources. They were not 
a big gift. Was there any federal money that you

00:40.885 --> 00:44.148
recall that made that possible? It was a mixed bag, 
actually, Haskell. The primary source, of

00:47.791 --> 00:51.794
course, was state funding, you know, from the 
normal sources. But we did have some development

00:52.295 --> 01:00.862
grants and outside money and things like that, and 
federal money, too. You mentioned Tiger Teague's

01:01.363 --> 01:03.524
contributions. He got us everything that he could 
from the federal government, including his board

01:03.564 --> 01:10.150
of faculty. students and so forth. Not only just 
buildings. I mentioned only buildings, but

01:14.844 --> 01:17.772
that's only a part of what he got for us. Did he have 
any pet, any programs that were of highest

01:24.912 --> 01:26.235
priority to him? You mean Tiger? Yes, sir. Oh, 
yeah. I'm glad to see that the building recognizes

01:32.468 --> 01:41.087
his real, he was really gung-ho on space, NASA. Ah, 
yes, yes, yes. Yes, that's right.

01:48.200 --> 01:51.365
He and LBGA got the center down at Houston. It was 
probably primarily responsible. But he got us all

01:53.728 --> 01:56.352
that money for the space building. It's called the 
Tiger T. Well, you know, I don't have to tell you

01:56.673 --> 02:01.200
that. In the 70s, my office was there a good bit 
because the president's office was then across

02:01.220 --> 02:07.950
the street. Now, that causes my mind to jump back to 
organization. When Dr. Harrington retired, Mr.

02:16.600 --> 02:22.966
Rutter became president of the system and of the 
university. Well, officially, Dr. Harrington

02:24.027 --> 02:26.790
didn't retire. He became director of foreign 
programs. And at that time, when that happened,

02:32.035 --> 02:36.539
yes, the board brought it about. Mr. Rutter was 
appointed to both positions, same as Dr.

02:36.900 --> 02:42.325
Harrington had held at one time. And so when you 
went to him for a decision, you knew that it did not

02:46.368 --> 02:51.397
need to go beyond his desk. Did it make the 
institution function more efficiently? I think

02:55.824 --> 03:02.515
so, because he and I were on the same wavelength and 
team. He moved down to the system building, to the

03:03.337 --> 03:07.544
chancellor's office, and left me in the Koch 
building. Literally, without portfolio, I was

03:08.045 --> 03:12.392
running A&M. at that time. Of course, he was 
coordinating the whole thing. But we would meet

03:17.157 --> 03:23.343
when he was in town weekly down in the system 
building for at least an hour and a half every week.

03:24.324 --> 03:28.027
And I would have the things I wanted him to bless and 
discuss with him. And he would usually endorse

03:29.008 --> 03:32.411
them, most of them. Your title did not change. Oh, 
no. I was still Vice President for Academic

03:34.393 --> 03:37.797
Affairs and Dean of the Graduate School. Mr. 
Rutter wasn't a great believer in high-sounding

03:37.817 --> 03:41.400
titles. But in fact, you were the... I was the 
president of A&M in operation, right. I don't want

03:50.239 --> 03:51.461
to make that claim. No, I hear you. The enrollment 
was going up every year. The boom was coming.

04:02.463 --> 04:09.216
Initially we built up graduate enrollment more 
than we did undergraduate, but eventually

04:02.463 --> 04:09.216
undergraduate enrollment took over. And now, of 
course, it's in the ascendancy. Did any of the

04:12.242 --> 04:16.770
programs move faster than you expected them to? I 
was surprised. I don't know if it was faster than I

04:20.713 --> 04:32.207
expected, but because of the tactics we were using 
in chemistry as well as economics that you

04:20.713 --> 04:32.207
mentioned, we brought in groups of people at once. 
In other words, established an instant

04:32.807 --> 04:39.656
department on the rise. Mostly these were senior 
research scholars. We weren't looking for

04:45.033 --> 04:46.896
outstanding teachers. Many of them were 
excellent teachers too. Now I'm assuming that

04:48.658 --> 04:53.806
didn't do it in other departments simply because 
the resources. That was it mostly. Later I

04:55.969 --> 04:57.111
convinced Mr. Rudder if we were going to ever be a 
great university we had to have a strong level of

04:57.171 --> 05:07.266
arts too and that's when we started to build it up 
and now it's well recognized. Doing quite well.

05:08.388 --> 05:09.151
Let's see. Do you remember any good Aggie story, 
anecdotes that may have nothing to do with what

05:09.693 --> 05:19.731
we've been talking about, just their good 
recollections of? Well, Haskell, I'm not an

05:21.668 --> 05:27.058
Aggie, you know, by graduation, only 
affiliation. Neither am I. But I used to, the Aggie

05:27.860 --> 05:34.392
stories that were told me, I would promptly forget 
because I hated most of them. No, there's a lot of

05:35.334 --> 05:40.263
them, but I can't think of any right now. But 
particularly the ones that they would try to Make

05:45.479 --> 05:48.824
A&M out as it dunks or something like that. No, but 
do you remember any attempted pranks at Mr. Rutter

05:48.844 --> 06:05.027
or anybody else that may not have gone off?

06:05.047 --> 06:08.292
No, I'm sure there were some, and I probably knew 
some at one time. Let me share one on Hannigan. The,

06:11.433 --> 06:17.125
he was deeply concerned about the civilian 
students walking across the drill field. Oh,

06:17.347 --> 06:17.608
yeah. And they were wearing a path. So he gave 
direction to somebody that they strung some slick

06:19.533 --> 06:28.662
wire all the way around the drill field, around the 
trees. And the first night, the wire was cut, of

06:29.382 --> 06:33.126
course, into a zillion pieces. We had a committee 
meeting the next day, and he couldn't figure out

06:33.687 --> 06:40.493
where anybody could have gotten all those wire 
cutters. And I said, well, I suspect they got the

06:41.294 --> 06:45.658
pliers out of their pickup trucks. And he said 
something to the effect, what, they carry pliers

06:46.938 --> 06:51.835
with them in their truck? And I told him, yes, for a 
farm boy or a ranch boy that was a normal And he was

06:57.113 --> 07:01.037
kind of taken aback by that. Oh, it was Hannigan. 
Yes, sir. Oh, yeah, Rudder would have known. Oh,

07:03.960 --> 07:04.520
yeah, Mr. Rudder would have known. No, Rudder 
wasn't in the room. No, I know that. No, Hannigan

07:08.024 --> 07:10.006
was taken aback. All right, let's see. Getting 
further along,

07:13.430 --> 07:26.783
for you personally, of what are you most proud 
during your A&M experience? The academic

07:28.872 --> 07:39.634
programs in general and the faculty, the initial 
faculty that we brought in that really

07:28.872 --> 07:39.634
transformed A&M from a college, teaching 
college, to a model university. Without

07:41.317 --> 07:45.666
identifying names, but you know the names as well 
as I do that were here. Is there anything? Really

07:47.961 --> 07:56.071
the graduates, building up with the graduate 
programs was probably my strongest thing that I

07:47.961 --> 07:56.071
prized most. A lot of people would probably put 
that secondary, but I wouldn't because research

07:56.472 --> 08:06.303
and top teaching has always been my priority, and I 
think they go hand in hand. In the run of events

08:07.905 --> 08:13.712
during your years at A&M, which events did you 
enjoy most?

08:16.966 --> 08:23.702
Oh, seeing the aspirations and the dreams 
develop, I guess, without singling out

08:16.966 --> 08:23.702
individual ones. There's dozens of those. What 
about, did you like commencements? No, frankly,

08:30.938 --> 08:39.231
I'm not a crate, because as you and I both know, 
you've heard one in commencement speech, you've

08:30.938 --> 08:39.231
heard them all, or most. Occasionally there's one 
that stimulates you and it's different, but most

08:39.672 --> 08:46.122
of them are fairly rote and routine. No, I never 
cared too much for the protocol or the formality of

08:46.222 --> 08:54.094
academia.

08:54.800 --> 09:07.999
I've decided that one, in being away for 17 years 
and coming back, one of the important ingredients

08:54.800 --> 09:07.999
to A&M's experience are a number of events that are 
inclusive. fish camp, midnight yell practice,

09:08.384 --> 09:24.523
muster, elephant walk, commencement where every 
name is called, every hand is shaken, everybody

09:08.384 --> 09:24.523
gets their moment in the spotlight. That those, 
doesn't matter whether you're male or female,

09:25.104 --> 09:34.155
whether you're rural or urban, Texas born or 
anywhere else, there is that moment. And many,

09:34.523 --> 09:45.939
many institutions have dropped the commencement 
and now have a kind of a quick hereby confer upon you

09:34.523 --> 09:45.939
to be seated. And it takes a long time here now with 
three commencements in the spring and two in the

09:46.780 --> 09:54.230
winter, but I think that's a good investment. I 
think that's a tradition that's paid off. But to

09:57.514 --> 09:59.417
respond to your query about the student 
activities and the traditions that have

10:00.697 --> 10:08.128
developed, all of which I honor and respect. I was 
never deep into the student activities when I was

10:08.749 --> 10:12.695
at A&M. Oh, I had students, sure. I had graduate 
students. I had a lot of undergraduates that I

10:15.459 --> 10:25.675
still remember fondly, but I never got involved 
emotionally into the thing that really kicks me

10:15.459 --> 10:25.675
off. Just going to the football stage with you to 
hear the Aggie war half.

10:34.670 --> 10:37.613
Okay, two more questions. Let's make believe that 
somebody gave you a million dollar check that had

10:38.294 --> 10:52.310
the stipulation you must give it to Texas A&M, but 
you can decide the use of the benefit of that. What

10:52.370 --> 10:53.772
would you give it for?

10:56.502 --> 11:04.253
I would first do current research to find out 
what's going on in certain activities that I have a

10:56.502 --> 11:04.253
particular fondness for. And if I felt there was 
sufficient evidence, then I would concentrate on

11:04.293 --> 11:19.894
these areas, building up faculty, students, and 
programs to the utmost in these areas.

11:21.832 --> 11:31.285
Some of the other lasting values that most of the 
former students think about after years of being

11:21.832 --> 11:31.285
gone from here, I went indoors too, some of these 
traditions. At the time that I was there, I wasn't

11:31.565 --> 11:36.732
gung-ho about them, to be frank, but now I am. I 
think they have value. Last question. What did it

11:40.557 --> 11:49.189
mean to you, as you look back, what has it meant to 
you that you came to Texas A&M back there in 1957?

11:50.063 --> 11:52.488
No, no, no, no. It was in 48. 48, yes, yes. What did it 
mean to you that you came here?

12:01.226 --> 12:02.148
At that time or now? Now. Now, seeing what's 
developed on the shores of the Brazos River over

12:06.331 --> 12:09.175
here. No, just like Earl Rudder, I'm sure, from 
above, he would be proud of what happened at A&M and

12:09.856 --> 12:17.988
what's developed. And I'm glad that I had a part in 
it. I'm not an Aggie, you will know. Well, I tell

12:23.997 --> 12:27.362
people there are some of us that are Aggies by 
choice. Yeah, that's what it is. We could have been

12:28.564 --> 12:31.148
other places, and we chose here. And I want to thank 
you for what you meant because I don't believe this

12:36.082 --> 12:40.161
institution today would be what it is if you hadn't 
been here. Well, thank you.
