WEBVTT

00:01.482 --> 00:05.787
We started working really off the coast of 
Southern California. And in 1940, we did make a

00:06.828 --> 00:15.899
cruise as far north as roughly the Columbia River. 
And another venture that was in 1939 was a cruise to

00:15.939 --> 00:29.295
the Gulf of California, which we made in the winter 
of that year, which was the first time that any

00:29.900 --> 00:44.199
vessel from Scripps had really ventured very far 
away from home, and this was really sort of

00:29.900 --> 00:44.199
exploring in those days because so little was 
known.

00:46.922 --> 00:58.978
And I don't know what might have happened if the war 
had not intervened, and I think that we would have

01:00.089 --> 01:22.333
had to find some larger vessel and that we would 
have, presumably within a few years at least, have

01:00.089 --> 01:22.333
moved out to operations on sort of an ocean-wide 
scale.

01:26.667 --> 01:52.719
Actually, I left Scripps in July of 1941, having 
spent a month prior to that at Woods Hole to learn

01:26.667 --> 01:52.719
something about the interpretation of bathy 
thermograph observations in terms of underwater

01:26.667 --> 01:52.719
sound problems. And on July the 1st, I moved down 
the Navy laboratory on Point Loma, which not as an

01:56.249 --> 02:10.140
employee of the Navy, but under one of these war 
research programs that

02:13.023 --> 02:22.772
later on by the NDRC, the National Defense 
Research Committee, I think it was called. And

02:23.693 --> 02:31.661
this was a essentially federally funded war 
research program administered through the

02:23.693 --> 02:31.661
University of California. And I stayed in this 
program at Point Loma until early in 1946.

02:42.740 --> 03:00.268
By that time, the work had been taken over by the 
Navy itself, but I still continued, as did many of

02:42.740 --> 03:00.268
the others there, to be actually as employed by the 
University of California. And during the first

03:01.490 --> 03:09.102
year or so down there, the work was primarily that I 
was engaged primarily how you might interpret

03:09.453 --> 03:27.795
various physical conditions in the ocean, 
primarily temperature and salinity and so on, in

03:09.453 --> 03:27.795
terms of the acoustic conditions in the ocean. We 
used to call it the echo-ranging problem, and this

03:28.596 --> 03:34.583
gradually gave way to some other environmentally 
related problems, but I became more and more

03:35.069 --> 03:54.096
involved in the general sort of administration of 
some of the basic research going on at the

03:35.069 --> 03:54.096
laboratory on Point Loma. And toward the end, I 
actually was an assistant director in charge of

03:54.116 --> 04:03.068
the research, which involved primarily set of 
acoustics of various kinds, but a good many other

04:03.959 --> 04:09.917
types of activities. Now, I have several 
questions on that. Now, you go to Woods Hole,

04:12.224 --> 04:16.517
though, to work with the BT for anti-submarine 
warfare, don't you? I did go back and work with

04:18.050 --> 04:43.146
Robert Montgomery for about a month, because at 
that time, as I indicated earlier, we really

04:18.050 --> 04:43.146
didn't know what the bathy thermograph was 
measuring and so on, and also how you might be able

04:18.050 --> 04:43.146
to use this kind of information in these 
underwater sound problems.

04:43.379 --> 04:45.322
naive as to what we were doing. But I contributed my 
small part here to the whole program in that I was

04:45.462 --> 04:57.340
the one who suggested they make photographic 
copies. And Montgomery and I worked out the first

04:57.540 --> 05:12.542
sort of system for coding these things and keeping 
the appropriate records and so on, which

04:57.540 --> 05:12.542
persisted for a good many years after that. Right. 
You're looking for ways of measuring thermal

05:14.526 --> 05:17.371
clamps. In effect, yes. There had been some work 
done by Columbus Islin that was told by Morris

05:20.355 --> 05:40.707
Ewing and some of the other people that were 
associated with them in the preceding few years.

05:41.159 --> 05:52.952
which showed the probable relationship of 
temperature and humidity conditions on

05:41.159 --> 05:52.952
underwater sound. And Morris Ewing's 
contribution, I think, was particularly to show

05:53.253 --> 06:07.909
that you could use some of the refraction 
computations that he was familiar with from his

05:53.253 --> 06:07.909
work in geophysics would be applied these 
conditions in the ocean, and of course it was not

06:08.412 --> 06:19.247
directly temperature and salinity that was 
involved here, but rather the distribution of

06:08.412 --> 06:19.247
sound velocity. And so there were, we had the clue 
as to what we should be doing, although a lot of the

06:19.267 --> 06:36.310
sort of techniques had not been worked out, and 
particularly during the first year or so, much

06:19.267 --> 06:36.310
effort went into devising ways of calculating 
these so-called ray diagrams and seeing how you

06:36.762 --> 07:01.352
could, in a sense, simplify some of the conditions 
as you observed in the ocean to compute these sort

06:36.762 --> 07:01.352
of ray diagrams and so

06:36.762 --> 07:01.352
on. Then a lot of effort was spent in the first year 
or two of making up what were called sound ranging

07:01.805 --> 07:14.345
charts, or sonar charts, which didn't depend just 
on the BT. We used every other scrap of information

07:14.405 --> 07:23.340
we could to essentially try and come up with some 
semi quantitative approach of the regional

07:24.046 --> 07:34.861
differences in sound ranging conditions that 
might be predicted from known characteristics of

07:24.046 --> 07:34.861
the ocean waters. Why photography? I'm sorry? Why 
photography? What made you think of photography?

07:40.268 --> 07:47.898
Oh, I guess because my father was a photographer 
and it seemed to me that the BT slide was like a

07:40.268 --> 07:47.898
negative. Why not put it in a in a projector and just 
make a print from this, which could then be

07:49.595 --> 08:04.775
enlarged, too, because the original BT slide you 
really had to insert in a magnifier in order to read

07:49.595 --> 08:04.775
it. We more or less standardized on what was 
roughly a postcard-sized reproduction. Now, all

08:13.266 --> 08:18.994
you have to do is stick them in a regular 
photographic enlarging machine and fairly

08:19.312 --> 08:21.875
contrasty paper.

08:24.639 --> 08:30.267
Now then, when you're working, I need to know 
something else here, too, right now. Why didn't

08:30.287 --> 08:35.233
you go with Revell to the Navy and to Washington at 
this time? Why did you choose Point Loma? Well,

08:37.076 --> 08:49.032
here again, there's some kind of interesting 
things that, if I remember correctly, about 1939,

08:37.076 --> 08:49.032
there was some concern about the international 
situation and so on. Revelle had applied for and

08:54.708 --> 09:04.800
obtained a reserve commission as an ensign, and I 
applied too. I think it was somewhat later than

09:04.860 --> 09:12.410
that because, yes, must have been. And I have 
somewhere in my files a letter that I received from

09:12.430 --> 09:18.698
the Navy saying that they regretted they couldn't 
offer me a commission because they had no

09:19.049 --> 09:28.459
foreseeable need for oceanographers. So, of 
course, Ravel went down to Point Loma at that same

09:28.479 --> 09:45.698
time, and I can't really remember how long he was 
there, but he was there for about a year or two

09:28.479 --> 09:45.698
before he went back to Washington.

09:46.505 --> 09:50.989
I had tried that route, but it didn't work. And

09:53.492 --> 09:59.277
I think that answers it, sure. And then during 
those war years, then, you were involved in

10:00.398 --> 10:05.944
research at Point Loma itself. Yes. I would, as I 
look back on it now, I did a good deal of of research,

10:14.855 --> 10:20.061
particularly in the first year or two. But really 
what I became more and more involved in was what I

10:20.181 --> 10:26.869
would consider a science administration. And 
things moved very rapidly in those days. And so

10:32.075 --> 10:43.208
there was a great deal of sort of planning and a good 
deal of traveling involved in that under the NDRC

10:43.964 --> 10:55.679
where there were several centers where work of 
this kind was going on, and they served as a sort of

10:43.964 --> 10:55.679
coordinating function. And so we met at what 
seemed like fairly frequent intervals for

10:56.179 --> 11:13.161
discussions of what we were doing, what we were 
finding, what we ought to do, and also in trying to

10:56.179 --> 11:13.161
prepare sort of manuals and documents of various 
kinds for the Navy. So this is part of what I

11:13.867 --> 11:22.503
consider is the administrative side. I wasn't 
involved too much with actual sort of budgeting or

11:24.026 --> 11:31.740
matters of that kind, but it didn't. What it didn't 
involve was us breaking out from the rather narrow

11:32.075 --> 11:55.369
kind of confines of individual research and 
getting involved with the programs and

11:32.075 --> 11:55.369
activities of a variety, probably a large number 
of people in fields that I had absolutely no

11:32.075 --> 11:55.369
familiarity with at all. And this, I think, was one 
of the effects of the war that it that those of us who

12:01.167 --> 12:26.128
were involved in activities of this kind really 
got broken away from what would have been a normal

12:01.167 --> 12:26.128
sort of pattern of

12:01.167 --> 12:26.128
career evolution here and got thrust into very 
large, very complex kind of problems involving

12:01.167 --> 12:26.128
fields which were And they were originally at 
least unfamiliar to us. I anticipate, to clarify

12:31.738 --> 12:39.727
my next question, with whom did you come into 
contact in about 1941 to 1943 to sort of move you

12:31.738 --> 12:39.727
into administrative oceanography here all at 
once? Well, Professor Sverdrup was originally

12:40.628 --> 12:55.845
to essentially head up the kind of oceanographic 
component at the Point Loma Laboratory. But he

12:56.517 --> 13:08.316
encountered security problems because of having 
his family, not his immediate family, but

12:56.517 --> 13:08.316
relatives in Norway and so on. And it was felt that 
he was in a sensitive set of positions.

13:16.042 --> 13:25.556
they would not give him security clearance, and I, 
essentially, had to take over what he might have

13:16.042 --> 13:25.556
done. And he returned, and he never really left it, 
because this was only a part-time sort of activity

13:26.417 --> 13:43.062
down at Point Loma, but he returned sort of 
full-time to Scripps.

13:43.497 --> 13:52.948
Walter Monk, whom we had originally had down at 
Point Loma with us, and who could not get security

13:43.497 --> 13:52.948
clearance. Frederick Van Monk took on this study 
of the wave problem, and I think it started

13:54.490 --> 14:05.423
originally under the Air Force's support. And out 
of that, this whole amazingly rapid development

14:10.295 --> 14:27.618
of understanding of the problems of wave 
characteristics, wind wave characteristics,

14:10.295 --> 14:27.618
and methods of predicting wind wave conditions 
and swell and surf and so on. And then out of that

14:28.840 --> 14:35.188
activity came the

14:36.164 --> 14:57.750
training program which was set up at Scripps, 
which I had no direct contact at all, although I was

14:36.164 --> 14:57.750
living within a few miles of it, which brought in a 
number of young officers from the Air Force and the

14:36.164 --> 14:57.750
Navy who were trained in these wave forecasting 
techniques. And as we were saying this morning,

14:58.169 --> 15:07.680
later on, a number of these young men returned to 
Scripps and finished off their doctoral work. But

15:08.581 --> 15:14.808
that was really one of the, I think, very dramatic 
developments during the war. Because prior to the

15:15.609 --> 15:25.780
time that Sverdrup and Munch turned their 
attention to this problem, which they had not

15:15.609 --> 15:25.780
really dealt with previously, there was 
virtually nothing known about the

15:26.317 --> 15:32.345
characteristics of ocean waves. It was a body of 
theory, but very little connection between the

15:32.426 --> 15:40.257
sort of theory and the real conditions. And there 
was only a very, very limited literature about

15:40.377 --> 15:46.946
wave conditions and wave behavior.

15:50.631 --> 15:55.598
Did you consciously make an effort at about 45 to go 
to Washington or to DC, or did that just happen?

15:56.624 --> 16:25.888
Well, here again, I think that Ravel enters the 
story because he had moved from the Navy

15:56.624 --> 16:25.888
Laboratories, Point Loma, to the Bureau of Ships, 
and in particular to the, I think it was called the

15:56.624 --> 16:25.888
Sonar Design Section or something of that name, 
under a I can't remember his rank now, but Bennett,

16:26.628 --> 16:39.908
and had the imagination to see the role and 
importance of ocean information to the Navy. And

16:40.829 --> 16:54.930
yet there was no mechanism by which the Navy could 
essentially continue the oceanographic studies

16:40.829 --> 16:54.930
and so on. There are a number of sort of related 
threads to the story which are involved in this

16:55.501 --> 17:20.015
thing, and that is that, as I mentioned earlier, at 
Woods Hole and at Point Loma, we prepared, for

16:55.501 --> 17:20.015
example, these sonar charts and so on. They were 
actually published through the hydrographic

17:23.935 --> 17:25.458
office. And so that during the war, they had set up 
in the hydrographic office an oceanographic

17:25.839 --> 17:38.422
unit, I believe it was called at that time. And this 
was under the direction of Mary Sears, who was

17:39.124 --> 17:46.838
being commissioned as a wave. They served during 
the war as essentially a publications outlet for

17:47.425 --> 18:03.445
some of the material being prepared under these 
war research laboratory programs. And they did

18:03.966 --> 18:08.632
some compilation of various kinds of 
information. But this was a temporary sort of

18:08.652 --> 18:12.156
situation. And one of the things that Revell and 
others were able to accomplished was to have the

18:16.957 --> 18:35.964
Navy Department set up, on a continuing basis, an 
oceanographic section in what was then the

18:16.957 --> 18:35.964
Hydrographic Office. And I was, since the offered 
the position and it looked extremely interesting

18:40.717 --> 18:58.343
and important to me at that time that to go back and 
start what was known when I arrived as the Division

18:40.717 --> 18:58.343
of Oceanography in the Hydrographic Office. Of 
course the whole thing was later became the

18:58.363 --> 19:05.914
Oceanographic Office, but it was a division and 
Shortly

19:06.451 --> 19:31.362
after I arrived in April of 1946, the

19:06.451 --> 19:31.362
oceanographic unit that had been in existence was 
being phased out, and the new division reached a

19:06.451 --> 19:31.362
low ebb of one girl who helped me and myself. I left 
about five years later with over 200 people in the

19:36.135 --> 19:50.464
division and operating two sort of what were at 
that time very large oceanographic vessels for

19:36.135 --> 19:50.464
the Hydrographic Office. So this was, yes, a 
challenging sort of thing. I felt that there were

19:56.733 --> 20:09.853
urgent needs to keep a sort of national program 
going, rather than letting things die, as they

19:56.733 --> 20:09.853
might have at the end of the war. And

20:09.893 --> 20:19.708
I think this was turned out to be quite correct. 
What sort of people did you look for when you went to

20:22.818 --> 20:25.961
establish this office? Did you already have some 
people in mind whom you wished to bring to

20:25.981 --> 20:29.244
Washington? Well, only a few people that I'd known 
for one reason or another and seemed desirable and

20:29.805 --> 20:45.961
seemed appropriate for the job. And the People 
that really were brought in as to be my principal

20:50.688 --> 21:10.805
assistants were Clifford Barnes, who you'll 
probably talk to next week, but he only spent a

20:50.688 --> 21:10.805
relatively short time with us and then returned to 
the University of Washington. John Lyman, who you

21:12.186 --> 21:20.593
may have encountered, who had been in the Navy all 
during the war as a reserve officer. and had been at

21:20.793 --> 21:42.833
Scripps before that, Thomas Austin, who's now 
head of the National Data Center, and another

21:20.793 --> 21:42.833
young man who'd been at the WAVE program at Scripps 
during the war, Charles Bates, who's now chief

21:20.793 --> 21:42.833
scientist for the Coast Guard. So those were the 
the, in a sense, senior people who came in early in

21:45.532 --> 21:52.701
the game. But what was...

22:00.791 --> 22:11.545
I think interesting looking back that far, which 
is just over 30 years ago, that at that time there

22:00.791 --> 22:11.545
was no classification in the civil service for 
anybody called an oceanographer. So one of my

22:11.605 --> 22:15.370
first sort of jobs back there was to set up the job 
descriptions for oceanographers, get them

22:15.991 --> 22:28.347
approved by the Civil Service Commission, and 
then begin to try and recruit some people. And I

22:29.008 --> 22:33.013
very soon found that there weren't very many 
people to be recruited. And as any administrator,

22:34.175 --> 22:42.606
I abhor as a job vacancy why we were in the position 
of having to hire people with degrees in physics or

22:44.290 --> 22:56.064
chemistry or geology and so on, with essentially 
no experience whatsoever in oceanographic

22:44.290 --> 22:56.064
problems. And I soon realized, as I'd learned 
during the war, that there was a real need for some

22:56.184 --> 23:07.398
kind of program to train people or educate people 
in the field. And so, as I sometimes remark, I

23:08.479 --> 23:13.926
decided to get out of the the hiring business and 
get into the manufacturing business, and that's

23:14.412 --> 23:24.102
why the opportunity to come to the University of 
Washington looked attractive to me. Not only was

23:24.142 --> 23:30.989
it sort of intellectually attractive, but I 
thought there was a very real sort of need here.

23:31.089 --> 23:42.681
Now, there was some graduate programs available 
in the early years following the war, but One of the

23:43.437 --> 23:55.664
things that really stimulated me into coming to 
the University of Washington was the opportunity

23:43.437 --> 23:55.664
to set up an undergraduate program in 
oceanography, which had never been attempted

23:43.437 --> 23:55.664
before. You know, I want to return

24:01.595 --> 24:07.043
I have several questions, though, right here 
concerning your activities in D.C. itself rather

24:01.595 --> 24:07.043
than Washington State. Was there much conflict 
between these civilian oceanographers and Navy

24:08.205 --> 24:13.874
personnel when you began to establish this 
office? Well, I wouldn't say there was any

24:13.894 --> 24:17.759
conflict. We were looked on as a set of screwballs 
by the establishment within the Hydrographic

24:17.780 --> 24:25.010
Office. They didn't know quite what we were or who 
we were or anything else. And so we were allowed

24:29.708 --> 24:45.146
really a considerable amount of sort of freedom 
simply because they had no prior experience in

24:29.708 --> 24:45.146
this area. And this

24:46.047 --> 24:57.640
period, and I can't identify it specifically by 
year, but the military budgets were being cut back

24:58.109 --> 25:19.290
very severely in the late 40s, and along with them 
the Hydrographic Office was being cut back by

24:58.109 --> 25:19.290
major amounts,

24:58.109 --> 25:19.290
and yet the oceanographic program continued to 
grow. This of course was looked on with some sort of

25:19.330 --> 25:28.099
favor and encouragement here, but I think they 
realized that there was something to be done here.

25:36.474 --> 25:48.231
Now, the people who are sort of particularly 
important in encouraging and supporting the

25:36.474 --> 25:48.231
growth of the oceanographic program were not so 
much within the office itself, but in the Office of

25:48.633 --> 26:03.075
the Chief of Naval Operations, people concerned 
with anti-submarine warfare and pro-submarine

25:48.633 --> 26:03.075
warfare and so on, the operating forces. And it was 
largely through their interest that we got the

26:04.077 --> 26:13.952
support and opportunities we did. What about ONR? 
I have to stop and think here again. That got

26:20.758 --> 26:23.662
started when, about 46? 46. It's not really called 
Owen Orr then, but Revelle begins to think about

26:24.483 --> 26:29.529
Owen Orr in 46. Yes, it was the Office of, what was it 
called? Something Rather Off, Orr? Something and

26:35.997 --> 26:37.759
Invention. Yeah, right, it's a strange title. 
Yes, and it must have got established about that

26:39.501 --> 26:47.631
time, and Revelle then moved from the

26:48.050 --> 27:12.471
Bureau of Ships to the newly established, and of 
course the establishment of ONR was in a sense a

26:48.050 --> 27:12.471
response to the phasing out of the wartime

26:48.050 --> 27:12.471
research activities under NDRC and the parent 
organization, which was OSRD, Office of

27:12.788 --> 27:22.518
Scientific Research and Development, I guess it 
was. And so the Navy was, in a sense, trying to find

27:23.379 --> 27:30.927
some mechanism to keep some of their programs 
going. We worked very sort of closely together,

27:33.209 --> 27:36.973
although I cannot remember that there were ever 
any sort of transfer of funds or anything, as one

27:37.578 --> 27:48.092
might again anticipate in more recent times. But I 
actually spent almost a year of it. It must have

27:51.997 --> 27:56.843
been about 1949, 50. I spent the better part of a 
year actually in ONR on loan, in a sense, from

27:57.004 --> 28:06.336
the... Hydrographic Office to work on planning 
and so forth as related to anti-submarine

28:07.345 --> 28:17.340
problems. And so there was a good sort of, I think, 
there was no conflict there as you ran into some

28:17.901 --> 28:30.940
sort of of difficulties that you'd almost 
anticipate anywhere. But I had really very good

28:36.841 --> 28:54.125
rapport, I think, with the people in the 
Hydrographic Office, the CNO, and ONR, Bureau of

28:36.841 --> 28:54.125
Ships, and so on. So, no, I don't feel there was any 
antagonism, certainly there was a difference in

29:01.885 --> 29:12.319
perspectives on a lot of the problems. I went back 
to Washington with the idea that we ought to be

29:13.120 --> 29:30.323
doing a lot of work on the Arctic, and this had 
seemed to me a good sort of subject in which we knew

29:13.120 --> 29:30.323
very little and that we ought to be doing some work 
up there. And here's where we got into

29:30.944 --> 30:00.293
lack of appreciation on the part of the 
particularly CNO, who informed me and my boss, the

29:30.944 --> 30:00.293
hydrographer, in no uncertain terms that the Navy 
had no plans to operate in the Arctic and therefore

29:30.944 --> 30:00.293
had no reason to want to spend any money trying to 
find out about it. So one of the things I was able to

30:04.156 --> 30:20.357
do, in part with assistance from ONR and some 
others, was to, in effect, bootleg some, get some

30:04.156 --> 30:20.357
work started in the Arctic.
