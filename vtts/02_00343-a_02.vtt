WEBVTT

00:02.748 --> 00:04.010
Okay, just go right ahead. So that's what we were 
thinking about on chemical characterization of

00:05.913 --> 00:09.159
it. Then we felt that we needed to do some 
processing work. One of the cries that has gone up

00:16.571 --> 00:27.068
previously is, well, you remember two, three 
years ago we had this small seeded grain in the high

00:16.571 --> 00:27.068
plains. Well, that wouldn't process. In other 
words, they'd try to run it through their steam

00:29.677 --> 00:37.887
flaking equipment, and then the regular grain 
would do all right, and that damn stuff wouldn't

00:29.677 --> 00:37.887
do. So Dean Ray told me by phone that they had some 
loads of this stuff coming up there. They were

00:43.173 --> 00:48.400
going to try it in processing, and if it would work, 
well, they'd try to work it into their rations. If

00:49.741 --> 00:52.144
it wouldn't, well, they'd just be hands off of it. 
So we thought we'd better do some processing work

00:53.018 --> 01:16.394
on it to see what would happen to this type of 
material when it is processed by the usual

00:53.018 --> 01:16.394
methods, dry grinding, micronizing, steam 
flaking, and then, of course, the wet grain

00:53.018 --> 01:16.394
treatment reconstitution, this type of thing. 
Then, too, we felt that we should do digestion work

01:16.414 --> 01:20.140
with it And this is where Lichtenwalder is going to 
come in and then do animal studies which would

01:21.487 --> 01:44.389
involve growth and lactation and those two mainly 
using dairy cattle and swine and poultry and beef

01:21.487 --> 01:44.389
cattle and Lichtenwalder I think will probably 
feed it to some lambs as well. So that's where we are

01:45.390 --> 01:50.835
on it and of course this jar, I mean Dudley Smith sat 
through this meeting with us, and he sort of

01:51.254 --> 02:01.847
provided the administrative blessing, I guess, 
for it. And it's gone from there to where this has

02:01.867 --> 02:08.214
now been sent out to department heads and resident 
directors. We're apparently in business. Could I

02:09.656 --> 02:11.198
get a copy of that? Yeah, I haven't got anybody to 
copy it today. The secretary's gone, we've got to

02:14.982 --> 02:17.245
get this killed.

02:20.245 --> 02:26.053
It's got some terminology in there I think that 
might be helpful to us. Thank you. John, I believe

02:26.554 --> 02:40.074
that Dudley told me that I believe this was a group, 
sort of the initial task force that went down there

02:26.554 --> 02:40.074
that included Roland Smith, the extension grain 
marketing specialist. And what does this mean on

02:40.094 --> 02:44.360
fulfilling a grain contract? I assume this is one 
of the real concerns. That's it. Right after we

02:49.642 --> 03:10.146
were down there, there was a representative of a 
Japanese company in here, and

02:49.642 --> 03:10.146
I asked him what they were, he had spent some time 
looking at the situation, and he said, well, our

02:49.642 --> 03:10.146
contracts call for number two grain, and we can get 
plenty of it elsewhere. And you see, the

03:12.129 --> 03:15.953
interesting thing was, If you go down to the lower 
valley, they started earlier, and they're

03:17.907 --> 03:26.516
harvesting down there, and they might have had 75% 
of it out before the rain hit. So the grain, so the

03:27.777 --> 03:35.544
harvest was progressing northward until it was 
stopped by this heavy rain at Corpus Christi in

03:27.777 --> 03:35.544
that area. And at that point, Norman Vestal, agent 
in Oasis County, said, we got a wall-to-wall grain

03:35.925 --> 03:45.214
sorghum in this county that's probably in the 
neighborhood of 300,000 acres. And there's over

03:45.802 --> 03:48.646
200,000 of it that's still in the field. So they 
had, we'll say maybe 20-25% of their harvested up

03:49.126 --> 03:53.052
there. In previous years when this had happened, 
they only had a limited amount of this stuff. And

03:59.540 --> 04:05.548
they could blend it with their already harvested 
better grain and go ahead and send it for export.

04:06.001 --> 04:10.547
Well, this year, when you got 75% of it like this, 
you ain't got nothing to blend to it. That's right.

04:11.488 --> 04:13.290
So there they sit with all this grain. They've 
either got to bring in grain from outside the area

04:13.310 --> 04:19.418
to blend with it or else do something else with it. 
And plus the fact that it was probably in worse

04:20.519 --> 04:25.105
condition than previously been the case, too. 
Well, now, on your designated task force for the

04:25.926 --> 04:34.557
Sargon Research, how Do you continue to work with 
Extension? Or do you? There's no one on that list

04:40.939 --> 04:45.325
from the director's office. That's right. That 
was sort of an enabling act, wasn't it? Yes, it was

04:49.611 --> 04:51.774
sort of an enabling act. Well, first off, we called 
on the Extension people, Robert Rupp, area

04:52.915 --> 05:03.430
livestock specialist, and the district agent, 
Lynn Wilson, down there to can you find us some

05:03.848 --> 05:18.404
grain that is one hybrid part of which has been 
harvested before and part of which has been

05:03.848 --> 05:18.404
harvested after this weather period. They did a 
lot of looking and they never did come up with any

05:19.806 --> 05:23.950
really. Now apparently Prairie Foundation had 
some of their own that they had done this with and

05:24.351 --> 05:31.999
they are running a test with In other words, I'm 
including them right in the thing just like they

05:32.620 --> 05:37.545
belong to the outfit. I don't see any reason not to. 
And we may have the opportunity to do this with King

05:39.948 --> 05:48.636
Ranch also since they grew a lot of grain and they 
still have a lot in the field. And Steven Clayberg

05:49.678 --> 05:54.082
and some others were here last Monday. You were 
doubtless at that luncheon. He said that, well,

05:57.345 --> 06:00.889
who knows, we might have a hurricane that'll do the 
same thing to some grain that isn't already

06:01.578 --> 06:04.561
harvested. And if it happens, well, we'll be happy 
to work with you on this any way we can. But

06:10.827 --> 06:14.110
meantime, though, we've got Lucas Reyes. And 
Lucas is the agronomist. He's doing such things as

06:17.314 --> 06:26.843
the date of planting studies and the hybrid and 
variety tests. And he has provided us, from his

06:28.055 --> 06:44.901
data planting work, 24 samples of grain that run 
from 11 to about 20 pounds, 12 of which were

06:28.055 --> 06:44.901
harvested before the rain and 12 of which were 
harvested afterwards. Now these would be the same

06:45.341 --> 06:47.184
variety. The early planting in February was 
harvested before the rain. That that was planted

06:51.811 --> 06:55.497
in, I think, about the first of April. was 
harvested after the rain, but it's the same

06:55.898 --> 07:01.044
variety, so we get the varietal difference out 
here, hopefully. We got 53 samples from the outfit

07:02.906 --> 07:08.592
down there at Corpus. Whoever and wherever and all 
they came from, I'm not sure. But at any rate, we've

07:13.638 --> 07:23.509
got them and they're identified, and there are 
quantities of those that will be enough to let us do

07:13.638 --> 07:23.509
everything except the digestibility in the 
animal studies. We think with these samples from

07:27.338 --> 07:37.171
Lucas Reyes, there will be enough to do some chick 
studies, baby chick, which will be a good thing. On

07:37.311 --> 07:42.038
that 53 now, if you don't have a control, John, how 
can you really assess? Well, what we think of in

07:43.179 --> 07:53.293
connection with those is, okay, we can look at them 
chemically, we can look at them

07:43.179 --> 07:53.293
microbiologically, and tell what we've got here. 
And of course, a lot of this is going to have to be

07:57.301 --> 08:07.786
compared on

07:57.301 --> 08:07.786
the historical experience. In other words, I 
think Pettit The group over there, they've been

08:12.460 --> 08:16.025
doing this sort of thing. They know pretty well 
what to expect in normal grain. And they're on top

08:18.448 --> 08:24.377
of this whole business of mycotoxins and 
amplitoxins and so on. So I think that's why we just

08:25.698 --> 08:32.528
simply call it microbiological 
characterization. Yeah, they'll look at, the

08:32.548 --> 08:39.237
plan is at least, that they will look at everything 
we've got. If we've got it before and after, why...

08:42.008 --> 08:42.949
So much the better. I'm not sure what we'll get out 
of the 53 varieties, frankly, except maybe a body

08:44.271 --> 08:51.239
of information. An assessment of what is coming 
in. Okay, there it is. What does it analyze? And

08:55.825 --> 09:01.472
there are some notes made about the dates that the 
things were taken and this sort of thing. And you

09:02.854 --> 09:06.639
can tell pretty much what it looks like. But I think 
the simple fact that they'll be taking grain like

09:06.659 --> 09:11.745
that and plating it out to get an idea of what's 
going to grow off of it. And that will be useful

09:18.906 --> 09:22.330
information. Now all of this we're thinking of is 
pretty short term stuff. In other words, what I'm

09:26.476 --> 09:42.137
shooting for is to have a package of information 
that we can pretty much put together and make a

09:26.476 --> 09:42.137
publishable document of some kind by about 
Christmas. So we're not talking about years on

09:43.028 --> 09:45.271
this thing. We're talking about trying to hit it 
pretty hard. And I don't think very many of the

09:47.555 --> 09:53.604
things that we are talking about doing will take 
very much time. We're talking about only an 84 day

09:54.145 --> 09:57.209
feeding period on the cattle. Well, September, 
October, November. That'll do it. We can get them

10:01.656 --> 10:04.320
started with the first of September. And 
producers, meantime, they just have store grain.

10:08.786 --> 10:11.871
And then if we get an assessment that it really 
hasn't injured feeding value all that much, then

10:12.121 --> 10:20.936
we can move it into even the international 
markets, or certainly international markets.

10:21.056 --> 10:32.096
Now, of course, you're going to have to convince 
people of this, and this is the whole idea of trying

10:21.056 --> 10:32.096
to develop and document some definite 
information. Up to now, we really don't have that

10:32.516 --> 10:36.082
much information about it. I think everybody 
knows about it. The Prairie Foundation did a

10:38.969 --> 10:58.397
little feeding study the last time we had this, and 
their story was that this, what they called black

10:38.969 --> 10:58.397
grain, they didn't get a grade under anything 
then, was just as good as far as cattle performance

10:38.969 --> 10:58.397
is concerned as their better number two grain was. 
This grain sardine that you spoke of that had

10:58.417 --> 11:06.268
lodged completely, is that pretty much like corn? 
Will it pick itself up again? Yeah, by the time we

11:08.264 --> 11:16.495
got down there to Beeville this last time, Corpus, 
we went by there and it was harvested. It was gone.

11:18.518 --> 11:25.568
And Tom Longnecker told us that, well they didn't 
have a place to store it or anything and it was all

11:18.518 --> 11:25.568
damaged. He said we sent it all over to Perry 
Foundation because we had a bunch of our own cattle

11:26.429 --> 11:31.977
over there anyway. and therefore we sent it over 
there. Did they have to have any special pickup

11:35.501 --> 11:40.565
equipment or was it just a conventional combine? I 
didn't ask you. A lot of times when something like

11:41.787 --> 11:47.332
soybeans lodge, you have to have a special pickup 
arms. Yes, this is true I think with nearly

11:47.352 --> 11:58.562
anything that they harvest that way, with binders 
and mowers and combines and the whole works. But

11:58.582 --> 12:00.664
that's sort of where we are. We're in the process 
now of trying to, well, we've got these samples,

12:01.167 --> 12:14.625
nearly 100 of them, 53 plus 24, and I know there's 
some more. We've got some from Prairie

12:14.885 --> 12:21.894
Foundation, and I don't know, I mean, Lake Mauna 
has got all of those. But we're looking at almost

12:21.914 --> 12:27.141
100 samples of grain already. There's a lot of 
these things that we can do without any further

12:27.357 --> 12:31.122
ado. Just get at it. And the best judgment is that 
you've got something in excess of a half million

12:32.825 --> 12:38.433
acres involved. That's right. Now there's some 
terrific losses. For example, Leo Welder at

12:44.261 --> 12:52.433
Refurio had just finished combine. We visited him 
on this same trip to Beville. had just finished

12:56.281 --> 13:04.914
combining, and he said that before the rain, they 
were harvesting something like 42, 4300 pounds an

12:56.281 --> 13:04.914
acre. After the rain, they were cutting about 26. 
Almost half of it. Yeah, in other words, and you

13:10.983 --> 13:19.536
don't see it so much now, but when they first 
brought this back and they first began to get dry,

13:10.983 --> 13:19.536
he'd shake them like that and they'd just shower 
out of there. All the loose stuff is gone now pretty

13:20.237 --> 13:25.765
well, but it doesn't take too much. You can get 
grain out of it still, so there's an awful lot. They

13:31.761 --> 13:36.727
said that they probably had the biggest acreage 
and the highest yield they've ever had.

13:43.034 --> 13:44.876
But the grain market has been real funny. At the 
right after that, in other words during the week of

13:47.399 --> 13:55.549
wet weather after we were down there with this 
crash meeting,

13:58.043 --> 14:02.990
grain sorghum was selling at Corpus at about 
$4.85, $4.90. And

14:03.070 --> 14:16.730
then there was a boy in here in my office from 
Dilley, which is down there by Cotulla, that way.

14:16.750 --> 14:25.603
And I don't know whether the boy was completely 
knowledgeable or not, but he said they were paying

14:16.750 --> 14:25.603
five and a quarter farmers for grain at Dilley. 
John McNeil was down here for the animal science

14:27.743 --> 14:35.694
meetings from Amarillo, an area extension man out 
there. And he said the market had absolutely gone

14:36.635 --> 14:40.020
pot on the grain out there. Those

14:40.060 --> 14:46.970
people out there are just not interested in the 
Danish grain at all. I think probably because the

14:46.990 --> 14:57.244
grain had ripened farther north and began to get 
harvested here and on into central Texas. In other

14:58.220 --> 15:00.642
words, the grain was moving. They weren't out of 
grain out there anyway, so they began to take her

15:00.682 --> 15:08.208
off, and there's no support price on the grain 
anymore.

15:11.311 --> 15:19.258
They better watch it that they don't crowd some of 
these South Texas cattlemen into moving into the

15:11.311 --> 15:19.258
feeding end of it and feed their own grain. Could 
be. If they haven't got any market for this sort of

15:21.059 --> 15:25.923
stuff, the old cattle in South Texas might win it 
pretty well. That's right. Sure might. So,

15:28.527 --> 15:33.072
but that's sort of our story. Well, that's great. I 
hate stories about what we're going to do. Well, I

15:37.656 --> 15:44.863
always say, John, that such a story on research is 
sort of like trying to sit on a two-legged stool.

15:45.444 --> 15:50.990
We've got a problem and we're doing something 
about it, but we don't yet have a third leg with your

15:45.444 --> 15:50.990
research results. Which will prop it up. Yeah. 
So... Could I also get a copy of this U.S. Standard?

16:00.032 --> 16:01.034
You can take that one. That's the only one I've got. 
I got it from Roland Smith. I can give you another

16:03.738 --> 16:04.539
one. All right.

16:10.226 --> 16:14.452
I believe that would be helpful to fill in our 
knowledge to make sure we don't say something. One

16:14.472 --> 16:21.602
of the things about processing, you don't know 
Charter Pierce in the micronizing process, do

16:14.472 --> 16:21.602
you? Well, he invented, Chardo invented the 
micronizing process. What is that? Which

16:27.891 --> 16:34.598
consists, well it's a substitute for steam 
flaking. Steam flaking is what's been accepted in

16:34.618 --> 16:38.422
the cattle feeding industry pretty well. It's a 
pretty energy intensive system. But Chardo

16:43.027 --> 16:48.333
started out to pop grain. And he developed this 
machine. It's nothing in the world except for

17:27.091 --> 17:34.018
In other words, this is just a steel plate that runs 
through here with a flanged edge on it to keep the

17:27.091 --> 17:34.018
grain on. And it oscillates anyways like this. 
There's a motor that just simply runs. Popcorn

17:40.364 --> 17:40.964
shaker. Yeah, same idea as shaking it in a skillet. 
And these infrared generators are lined up over

17:43.787 --> 17:47.931
the top of it here. These are all gas. It's 
gas-fired. The grain goes in here, and it dribbles

17:50.954 --> 17:54.617
onto this skillet. and passes under these 
infrared generators, and as it gets down to this

17:55.070 --> 18:02.080
end here, it pops like this. What percentage of 
moisture does it have to be to pop successfully?

18:05.506 --> 18:07.909
Well, that's part of this thing here. And one thing 
is, it's like popcorn. There's some of it that

18:11.675 --> 18:16.542
simply won't pop, except this is the much worse 
than any popcorn you ever saw. There's no

18:16.562 --> 18:18.645
comparison. We did have some information... on 
the uh influence of moisture it is right here on

18:21.884 --> 18:48.702
percentage of pop and it looked as if it seems to be 
something like that and what if it doesn't pop well

18:21.884 --> 18:48.702
they do you can make another use of it i suppose well 
and what we found out from this was that it really

18:21.884 --> 18:48.702
doesn't need to pop anyway Because in this right 
here, first thing we learned is that the darn stuff

18:49.070 --> 18:56.059
isn't all going to pop. And therefore, to get any 
information on the influence of popped grain on

18:56.079 --> 19:05.611
animal performance, we're going to have to screen 
it so we have 100% popped. So in this thing here, we

19:07.013 --> 19:11.539
put a screen right in there, quarter-inch mesh. 
And that stuff that dropped through we called

19:12.640 --> 19:16.685
partial and non-popped. And it went through a 
rotor mill and came out here. that which came on

19:19.478 --> 19:48.372
over the screen was a hundred percent popped and it 
dropped in here and came out here and then we just

19:19.478 --> 19:48.372
plugged the thing up and let the whole mess come 
together through and we called that the uh partial

19:19.478 --> 19:48.372
and non-pop no the pop grain mixture yeah well the 
important thing is that we found that all of the

19:19.478 --> 19:48.372
heat treated grain differed from the original 
grain, but these three fractions didn't differ

19:48.622 --> 20:01.896
from one another in anything we measured, which 
indicated pretty strongly that it wasn't

19:48.622 --> 20:01.896
popping, per se, that was doing the job. It was the 
heat treatment. On the basis of that, Chardo

20:03.658 --> 20:11.026
Pierce scrapped the idea of popping grain, and he 
went to the micronizing concept. And what he's

20:11.046 --> 20:17.413
done now, instead of heating this to the popping 
stage like this, he heats it to where there's only

20:18.760 --> 20:24.706
about one or two percent that'll pop right in here. 
And all that is is a practical indicator that the

20:25.587 --> 20:29.491
grain is hot enough. And from there then, he drops 
that hot grain into loosely set rolls, and you come

20:29.911 --> 20:37.579
out with this right here. In other words, it's a 
kind of a thick, spongy kind of a thing. it looks

20:45.760 --> 21:01.542
like it's almost been flexed yeah yeah but it's 
it's in strict contrast to steam flaking

20:45.760 --> 21:01.542
which is this stuff here in other words the steam 
flake is a wet process
