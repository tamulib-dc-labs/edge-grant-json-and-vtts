00:01.668 --> 00:02.629
You mentioned poker playing. Was there a fair 
amount of poker playing? Well, you know, I never

00:04.772 --> 00:15.086
did gamble myself, but some of the boys did. Of 
course, that goes on in every kind of society. Once

00:18.831 --> 00:23.197
in a while, they'd get caught, and that was it when 
they got caught. Well, I asked somebody about

00:23.217 --> 00:29.565
working in school, and somebody told me about 
somebody that he knew They worked his way through

00:29.545 --> 00:32.931
school the last two years with a pair of dice. Well, 
that's right. A lot of them do. These boys got

00:35.756 --> 00:40.605
allowances, you know, and their parents would 
send them so much allowance every month. So this

00:40.625 --> 00:42.148
allowance would come in. I knew an old boy from my 
hometown there. He got an allowance every month.

00:45.314 --> 00:52.988
His daddy was a banker, and he got a pretty good 
allowance

00:45.314 --> 00:52.988
every month. Boy, in two or three days, that 
allowance was gone. He was a great, he rolled eyes,

00:57.473 --> 01:02.661
he'd do anything. So then I remember one time he got 
broke and he got the job selling pies. He was up

01:08.110 --> 01:12.196
there in Mitchell Hall selling his pies. So he went 
around, you know, and he got into a crap game up

01:12.917 --> 01:19.488
there and he lost all his pies. Who was he selling 
pies for? himself, trying to make a little money.

01:24.123 --> 01:24.724
Where'd he get them? Did he buy them in Bryan or 
something? I don't remember where he got those

01:26.126 --> 01:27.869
pies. I don't remember where he got those pies. 
Well, he'd buy the whole pie and sell it in slices

01:29.511 --> 01:31.674
then. No, he'd just sell the pie. And another thing 
they used to do was, I never knew what apricot pie

01:33.377 --> 01:43.992
tasted like until I got to be a sophomore.

01:44.012 --> 01:47.157
So that was the favorite cushion, we called 
cushions. as a favorite cook, apricot pie. So

01:51.261 --> 01:58.249
we got maybe apricot pie maybe once or twice a week. 
So they'd come in, we'd have apricot pie, and the

01:59.650 --> 02:07.899
chef would say, all right, fish, bring that pie 
down here. So he'd tell some fish, he said, now, I

02:07.919 --> 02:13.785
want you to get this pie out of the mess hall and 
bring it up to my room. So I caught some old fellow,

02:15.605 --> 02:19.455
some old boy up there one time. He had about 25 or 30 
pies in his trunk.

02:24.327 --> 02:27.135
He'd store them away in his trunk. So we'd have our 
job then would be Smuggle this pie, put it in your

02:29.746 --> 02:33.431
blouse, you know, and smuggle it out of the mess 
hall. Of course, there's an old Army sergeant. He

02:35.012 --> 02:37.315
was an old Sergeant Foster. I remember that. He'd 
just straight in there, you know, and he'd be there

02:38.677 --> 02:41.821
at the mess hall door. He'd see something, notice 
something, and he'd come here. Come here. He'd

02:47.007 --> 02:51.012
just reach in and unbutton his reach and take that 
pie. Yeah, you mean you put the whole pie in your

02:51.278 --> 02:54.282
bluff. Sure, sure. They'd just take it up to the 
room. Then at night, when you see this

02:56.805 --> 03:01.191
upperclassman, he'd invite a few of his friends 
in. They'd have a snack, a pie snack. I never knew

03:04.536 --> 03:08.742
what apricot pie tasted like until I got to see it. 
But they had it all the time you were there as a

03:08.802 --> 03:12.306
freshman, but you never got it. Then you used to 
have what's called a prune race. They gave us a lot

03:16.652 --> 03:20.998
of prunes, I guess, to keep us kind of regulated, 
you know, physically. Nobody seemed to care much

03:21.822 --> 03:24.986
for prunes, but I happened to like prunes. I always 
have liked prunes. So they'd come in, usually

03:28.030 --> 03:32.776
Saturday night we'd get prunes. They'd come in, 
you know, and they'd say, well, nobody eats prunes

03:33.938 --> 03:43.030
tonight. So we're going to have a prune race. So... 
the upperclassman down at this end of the table,

03:49.430 --> 03:59.504
he'd pick out a freshman, his freshman, and the 
other guy, he'd pick out his freshman. And when the

03:59.524 --> 04:02.468
meal was finished, nobody leaves the table now. 
When the meal was finished, well, then they'd give

04:03.630 --> 04:11.902
each one of us a bowl of prunes and give us a 
toothpick. And whichever one got the prunes

04:12.322 --> 04:16.027
finished first, he won. Well, if you If you won for 
your upperclassman, then the other

04:20.328 --> 04:26.655
upperclassman, he'd work you over. And then if you 
lost by the one you lost for, he'd work you over. So

04:32.022 --> 04:34.084
you couldn't win either way. What was the 
toothpick for, picking up the prunes? Yeah, you'd

04:35.906 --> 04:42.333
pick up prunes with a toothpick and stick them in 
your mouth, and the one cleaned up his dish. Well, a

04:42.353 --> 04:47.179
big bowl of prunes, enough for 12 men, you know, two 
bowls, enough for six men to eat. You ate the whole

04:48.391 --> 04:49.492
bowl. We'd have to eat it, yeah. I meant you were 
regular for a couple days.

04:55.320 --> 04:59.326
Another thing that happened funny, I was walking 
post over one night. See, we had the artillery down

04:59.346 --> 05:05.694
there, and we had the horse cavalry, and we had the 
Sigma Corps, and we had the Air Corps. So the old

05:07.476 --> 05:10.380
Foster Hall used to quarter the battery. The 
battery was quartered in Foster Hall. So I was in

05:15.767 --> 05:16.669
the infantry. I was nothing to them. So they'd send 
a boy from the infantry, a blue catcord on the cat,

05:18.935 --> 05:32.351
or some other organization, some other company, 
you know, into this Foster Hall. Those artillery

05:32.812 --> 05:35.835
boys give you a hard time. But you know how old 
Foster Hall, you ever seen Foster Hall? Only

05:38.318 --> 05:38.899
pictures. Well, it's built in two wings, and you 
had a rotunda. up four floors, four floors up. They

05:47.827 --> 05:57.696
had a rotunda, and each round, each one of these,

05:47.827 --> 05:57.696
they had banister ratings, and it didn't clear up 
the top of the ceiling. So you had to walk from one

05:59.177 --> 06:01.519
wing to the other. So I was over there one night 
walking post in Foster Hall, and the thing was that

06:03.361 --> 06:12.870
when the Sentinel walked come in the open, you see, 
for those boys up there in the battery, they'd get a

06:13.188 --> 06:21.565
big GI can full of water and get up on the top floor. 
And when you went, they'd come in the open there,

06:21.585 --> 06:27.978
they'd let you have that can, that GI can full of 
water. So I was over there one night walking post,

06:29.321 --> 06:32.227
and I was pretty careful. I was always looking when 
I went by. We had an old commandant down there we

06:35.648 --> 06:39.473
called Bull Muller. Old Bull. Oh, he just scared to 
death. He had those steely blue eyes, you know. The

06:47.463 --> 06:49.826
story was he'd been over a bunch of niggers all his 
life. And he was rough. I don't mean anything. He

06:51.528 --> 06:52.189
was rough. And he just scared these freshmen to 
death, you know. He'd just take that rifle and

06:55.914 --> 06:58.818
swing it up there and look at it. And I had to always 
pardon him. Went with him and he'd look at it, you

07:03.509 --> 07:08.538
know, and he'd just nod to that sergeant. And that 
meant you got around to it. So you'd take in a

07:12.965 --> 07:17.493
number, your name, and your company, and so forth. 
So he came in there and it was raining that night and

07:17.513 --> 07:25.787
he had on one of these old ponchos like this. like 
these old officers used to wear. So he came up, and I

07:29.896 --> 07:35.002
came to present arms. He says, put your fourth 
general order, Senator. I stopped just outside of

07:41.911 --> 07:46.036
that rotunda. See, an old bull, he was a little 
outside of me. So I started spitting that general

07:51.242 --> 07:54.846
order out. And boy, the first thing I heard was, 
shh, here comes that water. And it missed me, but it

07:59.786 --> 08:02.650
just hit old Bull full blast. He shook that old 
poncho, and he had one of these old campaign hats,

08:03.412 --> 08:11.966
you know, with an officer's hat card on it. He shook 
his poncho, and he looked up, you know, I just wet

08:12.366 --> 08:16.012
him all over. He looked up, went up, he whirled 
around, he started up the stairs, and he got about

08:16.032 --> 08:22.082
halfway. And I guess he figured, oh, he knew then he 
couldn't find out who it was. He didn't have a

08:28.494 --> 08:30.957
chance. So then the next day, the colonel got up and 
read a general order in the mess hall. The entire

08:38.646 --> 08:40.768
battery was campus for a month. Everybody in the 
foster halls was campus for a month.

08:49.178 --> 08:50.400
We used to have a lot of fun. Oh, yeah, that hell of a 
lot. Then another kid down there, he was a country

08:53.129 --> 08:59.899
boy, you know, and he was very ambitious. We used 
to... A fella get too ambitious, you know, we'd

08:59.919 --> 09:04.045
give him a hard time. That is, we'd play lots of 
tricks on him. They used to have these old bellhop

09:06.809 --> 09:10.113
uniforms. We called them, you know, days gone by 
with these big insignia on them. So we got... a hold

09:20.045 --> 09:21.247
of this old boy. His name, I believe his name was 
Green, I forget now. But anyway, they got a hold of

09:25.672 --> 09:39.030
this old boy and they told him, he says, you know, 
Green, you're doing line in this military and the

09:25.672 --> 09:39.030
first thing you know, you're going to be a 
corporal. So, of course, that went over big with

09:41.072 --> 09:46.219
him. So then they got one of these old bellhop 
uniforms and And

09:51.297 --> 10:03.149
he sewed one of these big chevrons, you know, like 
they used to wear it, covered carpal chevrons on

09:51.297 --> 10:03.149
his sleeve here. And I told him, and I says, we got 
some upperclassmen in on it too, see. And we told

10:10.136 --> 10:14.361
him, and I said, Green, you're going to be color 
carpal. There's no such thing as a color carpal.

10:16.944 --> 10:18.385
You're going to be color carpal here. for this 
regiment. And he says, but there's one

10:21.192 --> 10:23.975
stipulation. He says, you're going to have to earn 
this color corporal. You're going to have to get

10:26.738 --> 10:32.504
out and do guard duty on the main drag, I mean, on the 
military walk every Sunday afternoon. And he

10:33.385 --> 10:41.553
says, your duty is going to be to stop every car that 
comes along and search the car for liquor. There's

10:41.574 --> 10:43.375
liquor coming on this campus. You know what that 
means, liquor on the campus. So he fell for it. We

10:48.637 --> 10:56.626
used to have these ministers, various ministers 
that come down every Sunday, you know, to preach

10:48.637 --> 10:56.626
various denominations. So they had an 
Episcopalian, I think he's a right reverend or

10:56.646 --> 11:00.290
something. And so old Prexy, that was old Dr. 
Brazell, he was out on a Sunday afternoon showing

11:00.390 --> 11:07.638
him around the campus, you know. So here this old 
boy, he was out there with his gun, you know, around

11:09.300 --> 11:14.646
the flagpole and Walking around, he stopped the 
car and coming up to old Prexy's car. Of course, old

11:18.840 --> 11:22.867
Prexy had a shopper. So he told him, he said he 
wanted to inspect the car for liquor. He had orders

11:28.315 --> 11:30.719
to inspect the car for liquor. So old Prexy, he 
wanted to know what that meant. So he finally told

11:35.306 --> 11:43.519
him, he says, you've been duped, son, so you're 
going back to your room. And of course, it

11:44.410 --> 11:47.274
embarrassed him around this preacher.

11:49.997 --> 11:56.745
But he sent the old boy home back, and it finally 
soaked in what the deal was. We had a lot of fun. We

11:57.767 --> 12:00.911
had more fun than they have now. We had the junior 
band. They don't have that anymore, I guess. I

12:06.978 --> 12:07.919
don't think they do. It varies from year to year 
what they do have. I believe they still have the

12:12.145 --> 12:14.147
senior ring dance. and they have a...

12:22.060 --> 12:23.943
I don't think you call it a senior banquet. I think 
the former students have a banquet of some kind for

12:23.983 --> 12:33.495
all the graduating seniors, and they try to get 
them to join the Association of Former Students

12:23.983 --> 12:33.495
and things like that.

12:36.339 --> 12:38.322
When I was there, they had three dances. There was a 
Thanksgiving hop, the RV hop, And the final bowl,

12:44.452 --> 12:48.038
that's three hops. And on various Saturday 
nights, you know, they had the Aggieland Six. They

12:54.508 --> 12:59.396
had a good orchestra.

12:59.536 --> 13:00.998
Who played in the Aggieland Six? Was that students 
or faculty? No, students. It was made up of

13:03.622 --> 13:05.886
students. You remember this fellow Bartlett? 
That was Saul Bartlett that was retired as a

13:09.977 --> 13:15.065
four-star general in the Air Corps? Wasn't it 
Bartlett? No, let's see what it was. He was a junior

13:20.553 --> 13:25.060
when I was a senior. And if I remember it right, I 
believe he paid the trombone or something. But he

13:29.566 --> 13:32.110
was in that orchestra, the old one. I don't know 
whether I may have the name wrong. But anyway, he

13:37.153 --> 13:40.777
wound up a four-star general in the Air Corps. They 
gave him a big review down there sometimes. Oh, and

13:42.819 --> 13:50.949
I see that he was down there

13:42.819 --> 13:50.949
some time ago. I wouldn't be as sure about that. Did 
you have any favorite instructors? Well, we had a

13:57.937 --> 14:00.640
lot of unfavorites. Well, but... What kind did you 
have as unfavorites? Well, I guess they used to say

14:07.680 --> 14:15.051
the fourth year of fish chemistry was always the 
hardest. That's a fact. You'd see seniors with

14:15.692 --> 14:22.562
leather putts on, boots, going over there and 
taking that first year of chemistry. You want a

14:24.325 --> 14:25.306
real story? Yeah. A little life to it? Sure. You 
don't mind the words, the language? No, no. Well,

14:36.512 --> 14:48.627
we had a function down there that we used to call, we 
used to call the Piss Mount. And that was, that

14:48.647 --> 14:57.919
started on the first day of December and lasted 
until we went home for Christmas. So, uh, They'd

15:01.156 --> 15:03.299
hang a number on a fella's door. That was just a 
freshman. They'd hang a number on a fella's door.

15:07.124 --> 15:10.007
And he used to be the... In

15:10.027 --> 15:17.297
other words, he was the rain for this Pismount that 
night. So it was held between Tattoo and Taps. So I

15:22.283 --> 15:24.866
remember I saw a light. He was from my hometown. And 
they hung it on old Saul Wright's door. Then that

15:31.362 --> 15:37.248
happened in Milner Hall, too, when I was a 
fisherman. So old Saul, he said, well, he said,

15:37.268 --> 15:55.868
everybody's coming out now in sidearms,

15:37.268 --> 15:55.868
stripped naked, very naked, stark naked, in 
sidearms, and dressed caps. And he says, shoes,

15:57.873 --> 16:01.119
russet shoes. And that's all we had on. So we'd form 
out there, and then they had what they called the

16:05.166 --> 16:16.045
flaming fist pot bearer, which was an old chamber 
pot with some kerosene in it or something. And

16:16.205 --> 16:21.214
they'd rag and they'd light this, and then they had 
an escort for the and they'd march down before we

16:21.751 --> 16:27.042
lined up in formation. They'd march down this 
line, you see, formation. And then the master of

16:32.053 --> 16:37.385
ceremonies, that's what I was trying to think 
about. Old Saul, he was the master of ceremonies.

16:41.528 --> 16:46.516
This old prof we had down there, they called him 
Squirrel Tooth Moore. He had buck teeth, and his

16:46.536 --> 16:51.925
teeth had always shone, and we called him Squirrel 
Tooth Moore. His name was Moore. So, old Saul, he

16:54.910 --> 17:05.848
was a master of ceremony, so old Saul, that night, 
he got down and delivered a prayer up to Santa Claus

17:06.250 --> 17:28.512
says, when you come with your bag, he says, oh, 
Santa Claus, when you come with your bag, he says,

17:06.250 --> 17:28.512
for God's sakes, pick up old Square Tooth Moore and 
take him out here and dump him in the fish tank.

17:29.993 --> 17:59.511
so old Prexy had got wind of it some way I don't know 
and he and old Sergeant Smart he was a very straight

17:29.993 --> 17:59.511
military sort of a guy you know had snow white hair 
and always wore a black suit and a black bow tie and a

17:29.993 --> 17:59.511
white shirt and old Prexy did the same thing he had a 
black suit always a black suit black hat and a bow

17:29.993 --> 17:59.511
tie black bow tie and so they just happened to 
Somebody put them wise, you know. So they just

18:01.745 --> 18:06.490
happened to be coming up the top of the flight. This 
thing was up on the third floor. And they just

18:10.294 --> 18:19.723
happened to be getting up there to the top floor 
about the time old Saul was asking Santa Claus to

18:10.294 --> 18:19.723
drop old squirrel two more in the fish tank. So old 
Prexy, he just tapped him on the back. And I was

18:25.630 --> 18:27.051
pretty close by. He just tapped him on the back, and 
he says, get up from there, young man. And old Thaw

18:33.586 --> 18:36.791
looked down, and he saw those black shoes, you 
know. And he just come up kind of slow. And old

18:40.617 --> 18:43.481
Praxey kind of grabbed him and shook him a little. 
And he says, young man, he says, you know what

18:44.583 --> 18:50.732
you've been doing? And he said, old Thaw, he 
stammered out yesterday. He turned around to old

18:54.892 --> 18:59.357
Sergeant Smart, and he says, Sergeant, he says, 
this is the most sacrilegious. He looked at us all,

18:59.417 --> 19:01.059
you know, naked. He says, this is the most 
sacrilegious thing I've ever witnessed. I didn't

19:04.784 --> 19:07.187
know such things could happen in this school. And 
he says, who's responsible for this? The old

19:12.193 --> 19:15.016
sergeant, he didn't know anything. So he says, all 
of you get to your rooms. So we skedaddled. Boy, we

19:20.482 --> 19:21.844
couldn't get there fast enough. And Pinky Hudson, 
he was the company commander. He roomed down in the

19:25.652 --> 19:31.458
corner room for me. So old Pecksey, he turned 
around, he charged down there and opened the door.

19:35.701 --> 19:37.743
He didn't even stop to knock. He says, Captain 
Hudson, do you know what's been going on out here?

19:42.307 --> 19:44.689
And old Pinky, he kind of stammered around. Of 
course he knew, but he didn't say anything. He

19:47.031 --> 19:51.055
said, I'm a good man to jerk those three buttons off 
your shirt right now at this instance. He said, you

19:51.743 --> 19:54.813
report to me tomorrow. So he left. But that was the 
funniest thing, you know. We had a big laugh on

19:59.267 --> 20:00.672
that. That was the funniest thing. We had lots of 
fun. That's the old days, boy. That's what went on

20:07.882 --> 20:09.965
down there. Did you ever get any stories like this? 
No, but that was a nightly occurrence then from the

20:11.727 --> 20:14.610
1st of December. From the 1st of December until, I 
don't know, maybe I shouldn't be talking this.

20:18.654 --> 20:23.620
Hell, they might want to kick me out of the college. 
Oh, I doubt that. But those things, you know, are

20:24.701 --> 20:32.590
stamped on my memory of those days. And the junior 
banquets, you know, we had that junior banquets We

20:36.125 --> 20:37.406
had lots of fun then. I noticed in looking at the 
Longhorn for your senior year that you were in the

20:39.649 --> 20:46.056
Saddle and Sirloin Club. And that's what, a club 
for animal husbandry majors? Yeah. It was

20:52.843 --> 20:55.166
anybody, agricultural students, you see. I went 
down there and I signed up for civil engineering.

20:59.250 --> 21:00.932
That's what my dad sent me down there. So I attended 
classes for a while. About two weeks, I think it

21:06.382 --> 21:08.245
was. And I saw that I'd never be an engineer. I'm not 
good enough in math. I never did good enough. So I

21:14.613 --> 21:18.319
switched over to agriculture. I saw if I wanted to 
stay there. So I switched over to agriculture. And

21:23.386 --> 21:26.650
I was interested in that more than I was anything. I 
always liked it. I liked farming. I liked farming

21:29.955 --> 21:33.640
and I liked ranch life and like that. So I finished 
as an A.H., And they didn't have all this stuff they

21:37.313 --> 21:39.657
have now. We had animal husbandry. We had dairy 
husbandry. We had horticulture. And that was

21:43.803 --> 21:47.549
about it. And then agricultural education. Were 
there several organizations that the students

21:51.174 --> 21:56.342
could belong to? I know that you belong to the 
Saddle and Sirloin Club. Were there other kind of

22:00.078 --> 22:03.682
clubs that you belonged to other than hometown 
clubs? Well, we had our hometown clubs, yeah. We

22:06.264 --> 22:12.030
had our hometown clubs, Houston clubs, and Dallas 
clubs, and so forth. But otherwise, there wasn't

22:12.050 --> 22:13.252
much. Any kind of social organizations? Well,

22:17.156 --> 22:24.944
they had the masons. And some of the boys down there 
belonged to the masons and all. The social life, I

22:28.428 --> 22:34.676
guess you would think now, is rather limited on 
that. It's just kind of a filly. What we kind of made

22:37.961 --> 22:41.406
our own social life. We got along pretty good. Go 
back to the instructors. You indicated that the

22:48.095 --> 22:54.303
chemistry department was kind of about the least 
favorite of all, I guess. Well... I don't know. I

22:57.697 --> 23:02.484
passed the freshman chemistry in flying colors. I 
met my Waterloo in the organic chemistry, and I had

23:02.605 --> 23:07.852
to take that over twice. But it seemed that the 
freshman chemistry, more freshmen failed in

23:07.872 --> 23:17.747
freshman chemistry than any other one thing. I 
don't know why it was. But the old squirrel tooth,

23:19.951 --> 23:21.833
he was a good instructor. He wasn't anything like 
it. We just... We had a nickname, you know, for

23:24.503 --> 23:32.751
nearly all those, like old Script Mitchell, we 
called him Script Mitchell.

23:36.035 --> 23:38.978
We had another old instructor down there we called 
Beowulf. He was always talking about Beowulf. He

23:43.442 --> 23:44.944
must have been in the English department then. He 
was in the English department, yeah. Had a big

23:47.106 --> 23:49.729
bunch of fuzzy hair standing all up, you know. Some 
of them were characters, those old props. I

23:53.647 --> 23:56.531
believe some of them still are. Yeah. I thought 
they'd teach you school that way. He gets kind

24:00.216 --> 24:09.689
of...

24:00.216 --> 24:09.689
Well, I guess he gets away from everything, the 
boys, and it kind of makes him... He's kind of odd in

24:09.709 --> 24:12.072
some respects, yeah. You mentioned in talking 
about this piss mouth that the president came in,

24:13.654 --> 24:23.147
went to the company commander's door and 
threatened to... rip off his three buttons that

24:23.380 --> 24:28.249
night, which brings up an interesting point. Did 
both the president and the commandant have the

24:29.371 --> 24:39.691
authority to

24:29.371 --> 24:39.691
downgrade a student in the military? Oh, yeah. In 
other words, either one of them could have done it.

24:44.320 --> 24:45.642
Sure, anybody could have done it. Oh, I got busted. 
They made me color sergeant down there, and I got

24:47.566 --> 24:49.989
busted. Color sergeant. And then the old Major 
Morris busted me. And the reason I got busted was

24:55.615 --> 25:12.131
that I was going out for wrestling, and then I was 
going out for football, and I got one of these

24:55.615 --> 25:12.131
ambitious boys in my company to sub for me, see. And 
so the thing dragged on for a while, and I didn't,

25:17.077 --> 25:20.541
uh, I wasn't too eager to change over anyway. I 
didn't care. I didn't care too much about it. And,

25:23.684 --> 25:30.491
uh, old Major Morris called me up when I found a red 
slip in my mailbox to report to the commandant. So I

25:30.551 --> 25:39.901
went over there and old Major Morris,

25:30.551 --> 25:39.901
he says, I don't think it's fair that you wear the 
chevron and the other boy carry the flag, do you? I

25:40.242 --> 25:42.204
said, no, I don't believe it is. So I got reduced 
back to sergeant. What

25:45.680 --> 25:56.277
was the general attitude of the students towards 
Prexy Bazell and to the commandant? Did they like

25:58.000 --> 25:59.623
him? Did they like him or did they dislike him? 
Well, Prexy, Dr. Bazell made a fine. He was a fine

26:06.614 --> 26:08.076
college president. He did a lot for that school. He 
was a fine college president. We all liked Prexy.

26:13.753 --> 26:14.734
Yeah, we liked him. We got along with him all right. 
I remember I was going down the sidewalk one day,

26:17.398 --> 26:22.123
and I met Prexy. And

26:22.283 --> 26:29.011
I says, how do you do, Dr. Goodell? So he went on by 
and stopped me and says, He called me and said,

26:34.347 --> 26:35.509
Freshman. He knew I was a freshman. He says, 
Freshman. I stopped. He said, Come here. He says,

26:42.622 --> 26:46.048
Don't you know how to speak to me? I said, Well, sir, 
I just stammered. I couldn't say anything too

26:52.038 --> 26:54.282
scary. He says, From now on, when you meet me, he 
says, I'm the president of A&M. I'm the president

27:01.860 --> 27:02.982
of the college. He says, when you meet me, you 
salute me, like you do in Oxford. I said, yes, sir.

27:10.133 --> 27:11.956
We all saluted Brexit when we met him. I didn't know 
that. I hadn't been there long. I didn't know that.

27:14.661 --> 27:19.548
I'm interested to hear that, because I would not 
have thought that you would salute anybody other

27:14.661 --> 27:19.548
than a military officer. Oh, yeah, we saluted 
Brexit. I suppose you'd salute the president of

27:23.274 --> 27:25.718
the United States, wouldn't you? Well, he, in 
effect, is the commander-in-chief of the

27:26.930 --> 27:30.476
military. Well, he's out of uniform. Well, Prexy, 
he was the commander-in-chief, in effect, of the

27:32.980 --> 27:36.025
college. See, everything, anything, when a 
fellow got canned, well, it had to go through

27:36.045 --> 27:41.193
Prexy. He was the one that put the final lash on the 
tree. But as far as busting you from military rank,

27:46.927 --> 27:53.758
the commandant could do that on his own, or the 
president could do it on his own. Well, they

27:53.798 --> 28:00.148
wouldn't have busted the senior, because that was 
out of the question to have busted the senior. I

28:00.449 --> 28:06.218
don't know what they'd done to him, but that old 
Prexy, he was in a kind of a rage then, you know.

28:06.687 --> 28:11.193
working under impulse. He was so put out with this 
thing that had been going on, he just thought it was

28:11.474 --> 28:17.081
terrible, see, just terrible. He just never had, 
he couldn't imagine, he says, Sergeant Smart, I

28:17.101 --> 28:24.932
can't imagine that anything like this would go on 
in an institution of learning.

28:28.557 --> 28:37.226
And

28:28.557 --> 28:37.226
you mentioned two different commandants, Morris 
and Muller, I believe. Were they both about equal,

28:38.608 --> 28:42.291
or did the students like one better than the other? 
Well, now Morris wasn't exactly the commandant. I

28:46.576 --> 28:49.959
think Ike Ashburn was the commandant at that time. 
But Morris was the head of the military. He was a

28:53.763 --> 28:58.108
major in the military. He had charge of the

28:58.510 --> 29:07.563
military end of it, see. In other words, he was a 
ranking officer, and they had several officers

29:07.763 --> 29:15.214
down there, one down to captain, one down to 
lieutenant. But he was ranking, so he had the... In

29:20.920 --> 29:22.602
other words, he was the commandant. He had charge 
of the commandant, the military part of it. He had

29:25.225 --> 29:27.647
the right to bust you just like that. That's right. 
I remember somebody else had told me that somebody

29:28.989 --> 29:34.735
got the idea that it'd be good to have a civilian 
commandant. And that's when they made Ashburn,

29:34.795 --> 29:39.380
gave him the title of commandant. Yeah, he was 
commandant. And then I believe at one time he was

29:41.162 --> 29:45.267
also dean of men, I think. But

29:45.287 --> 29:50.893
heretofore, they'd always had a military... Old 
Bull Muller was a colonel. He was a full colonel.

29:55.895 --> 30:07.397
And he was a commandant there before Ike Ashburn.
