WEBVTT

00:01.837 --> 00:05.241
move him around, see him move, we let him run in a 
circle around us. And I slapped him on the butt just

00:06.502 --> 00:10.526
as he came around one time. He kicked me on the leg. I 
was incapacitated for three months with that one

00:13.990 --> 00:20.177
call. That really ensured my not calling him 
anymore. But it is one of those things that happens

00:25.062 --> 00:30.628
to you. Now, did you, within small animal, you're 
still doing a general practice. Is there any kind

00:37.320 --> 00:42.805
of, you didn't specialize in any facet or anything 
like that? Small animals, yes. I tried to take

00:45.228 --> 00:59.181
extra courses and continue the education in 
ophthalmology and surgery.

01:04.443 --> 01:13.716
And dermatology, particularly

01:04.443 --> 01:13.716
dermatology.

01:13.756 --> 01:18.342
I was a member of all those associations at one time 
to the National Association. Did you begin any

01:18.362 --> 01:22.327
kind of referral practice along the way 
somewhere? Yes, we had referrals from

01:22.808 --> 01:29.337
surrounding towns, particularly for surgery. 
Oh, okay. So they're coming to you for the surgery

01:30.716 --> 01:33.379
and dermatology? Yes. How about you now? Are you 
referring any of your patients to a specialist?

01:37.744 --> 01:38.024
Oh, yes. We refer lots to Dallas. They set up a 
referral clinic over there that had a very good

01:40.767 --> 01:53.262
surgeon, a board man, a board radiologist, and a 
board dermatologist. Who is it? Reedy was a

01:54.503 --> 01:55.865
dermatologist. Reedy? Okay. He'll be in this 
afternoon. Oh, I'll see him tomorrow, rather.

02:00.628 --> 02:01.048
That's right. I'll see Reggie tomorrow. What's 
his name? Gosh, he's in here. He was a surgeon. He's

02:09.237 --> 02:10.779
retired now. And the radiologist is still there. 
She's taking a partner. She's a ladybird. And they

02:19.909 --> 02:26.897
were very running in a high quality type thing. 
They never tried to give shots and do things like

02:28.793 --> 02:32.899
that. Of course, I was minoring in dermatology, 
but Reedy was a board man and taught some with the

02:33.099 --> 02:47.340
medical school over there. Because that's the 
conversion of the profession. We were very slow at

02:51.726 --> 02:56.293
it and very jealous.

02:57.067 --> 02:59.430
They have not accepted it until recent years. In my 
time, it was not done hardly at all. Do you see that

03:04.576 --> 03:08.861
as sort of the coming trend in veterinary 
practice? Oh, yeah. Specialization and referral

03:09.582 --> 03:11.425
practices? Quite a lot, yeah. A general 
practitioner who basically does the client

03:13.107 --> 03:20.796
ministry and then refers the more critical 
problems? Yeah, Herman Dietrich was a surgeon.

03:22.779 --> 03:25.622
Herman Dietrich, in fact, I think I may have met him 
at the... He might have sat at the table with me. He

03:31.219 --> 03:34.383
lives in Dallas and Colorado.

03:37.287 --> 03:47.239
D-I-E-T-R-I-C-H.

03:37.287 --> 03:47.239
One

03:37.287 --> 03:47.239
thing we haven't touched on well. Go ahead. You go 
ahead. You tell me, because that's better. I don't

03:51.905 --> 03:53.567
want to take you too much longer. Veterans should 
enter into their local politics and do public

03:53.783 --> 04:08.060
work, in my opinion, much more.

04:11.024 --> 04:22.558
There is some classical examples that Dr. Parker 
from San Antonio, you want to be sure and talk to

04:11.024 --> 04:22.558
him. He was the first veterinarian that was mayor 
of a large city and was on their board for many

04:23.737 --> 04:33.769
years. He was on the board of the AHA with me at the 
same time and in the AHA hospital. Dr. Abels

04:42.960 --> 04:53.693
locally has been head of his school board and very 
active in his local politics. Dr.

04:56.712 --> 05:03.398
Farrell, J.M. Farrell, his two brothers, has been 
very active in his school board, president of it in

05:03.478 --> 05:15.450
Arlington.

05:15.470 --> 05:21.115
Very active in local things. There's others, I 
can't bring them up right now. Okay, but that's a

05:25.802 --> 05:27.344
good point. That needs to be the other side. Yeah. 
Earl Waddell was active in Houston.

05:35.256 --> 05:37.960
There's several more down there that I don't... 
I'll kind of watch for that as I run along. What do

05:42.526 --> 05:51.760
you think are the major, let's say problems or 
crises or whatever, I'm not sure that's the right

05:42.526 --> 05:51.760
word, far better than the practice? in this 
decade, last few decades. When are you really

05:55.517 --> 05:56.718
confronting that? That seems to be a challenge to 
the profession. Well, I missed the county agent

06:00.221 --> 06:03.624
deal. I came in at the tail end of that, and I really 
don't know enough. You need to get an older man. I

06:10.750 --> 06:11.370
can get that. We've got a lot of them now. We had lots 
of good fights on that. Yeah, I know. I've got that.

06:15.174 --> 06:16.575
Rabies vaccines and stuff. Well, for one thing, 
when I was a long year, I had rabies clinics out in

06:16.595 --> 06:22.320
the surrounding towns And that area had a lot of 
rabies. I had three in my hospital at one time,

06:25.113 --> 06:29.919
rabid animals. That ain't fun. That makes you 
nervous. No, I've heard a lot of people talk about

06:31.882 --> 06:34.004
that. But the next one I would say is with the 
druggist selling prescription pharmaceuticals

06:35.226 --> 06:52.628
and treating animals, pharmacists treating 
animals, you know, a farmer comes in, well, you've

06:35.226 --> 06:52.628
got a milk fever. He'd hand him a bottle of dextrose 
and calcium and not knowing where to put it or

06:53.553 --> 07:05.825
anything else, diagnosis. The

07:05.845 --> 07:21.180
next one is our own problem was

07:05.845 --> 07:21.180
policing our own ranks for our veterinarians that 
did not follow up on their education, and I

07:22.882 --> 07:31.092
don't like the word, but just about quacking. That 
happened here in Fort Worth. I went out with the

07:33.295 --> 07:42.546
examining board a time or

07:33.295 --> 07:42.546
two. The examining board straightened out a lot of 
that, pursued those people that weren't up to

07:42.606 --> 07:51.977
quality or that were lowering the standards and 
violating laws, really, out of the state of Texas.

08:02.896 --> 08:23.483
Right now, one of the big problems are people 
coming into cities and towns with a mobile clinic,

08:02.896 --> 08:23.483
setting up rabies and distempering, anything for 
half a day to a day's time. where

08:24.897 --> 08:33.686
there are practitioners available to take care of 
the veterinary practice. I'm glad you mentioned

08:33.706 --> 08:35.208
that. They're just making a soar and getting the 
fast trades and the profit business, really. Is

08:44.157 --> 08:50.224
that because of the more intense competition in 
the business? Yes. And that's just one facet of

08:51.065 --> 08:52.787
that competition. I'm glad you mentioned that. 
started and it's all over but it's a real fight in

08:54.563 --> 09:23.035
the United States now these mobile clinics that uh 
I'm not talking about the mobile clinic that's in

08:54.563 --> 09:23.035
the end down and everything in the phone book yeah 
this is something else guy comes puts out sheets

08:54.563 --> 09:23.035
and has boys delivered to the houses and I'll be at 
the

08:54.563 --> 09:23.035
shopping center uh all day all Sunday I can see 
where that would really turn them out, too. Oh,

09:26.232 --> 09:26.553
hell yes. And a lot of people are, you know, cutting 
prices. And that gets back to the advertising

09:29.597 --> 09:30.939
problem. And lower prices are advertised. 
Because still, the profession does not condone

09:33.904 --> 09:37.469
advertising. They don't contribute to the 
community. They don't pay any taxes on the

09:39.392 --> 09:41.235
community. They don't contribute anything to the 
community. It's purely selfish. How in the world

09:46.683 --> 09:49.947
is it going to be combated? The State Association, 
I recommend it to the ones here They set up one right

09:53.609 --> 09:59.937
across the street from him and put up a big sign and 
meet his prices. That's discouraging, but it's

10:00.818 --> 10:05.423
been handled a different way. You can check in 
Houston on it. Dallas has had some of it. I'll watch

10:09.649 --> 10:10.249
for that. That's a good way to mention it.

10:16.277 --> 10:17.618
What about women in the profession? Do you have any 
comments on that? Women? When I graduated, there

10:22.145 --> 10:24.328
wasn't a woman in the class. And I've hired as many 
as four in my time, most of them in my hospitals and

10:24.489 --> 10:40.253
branch hospitals. And they have been very 
successful. Yeah, that's the kind of way I've got

10:42.056 --> 10:47.104
nothing but praise. Of course, now they 
constitute more than half. Right. And the

10:51.009 --> 10:55.275
graduates coming out of A&M now are most of them. 
You should see our local, I wish I'd brought it, got

10:55.295 --> 11:10.217
it about yesterday,

10:55.295 --> 11:10.217
people are available for practice and people are 
available for substitutions. I should get that

11:11.118 --> 11:12.480
back to you. Because that is one of the big 
problems. That's a good sign of the times. OK. In

11:18.271 --> 11:26.142
all due respect, I have kind of muddied the water as 
far as... They're part-timers. They're

11:27.183 --> 11:28.225
part-timers. They're real valuable. I used to 
employ military part-timers. And I went from then

11:35.294 --> 11:44.146
to graduate students that had to do work, you know, 
out with the practitioners. Missouri started

11:44.947 --> 11:46.810
early in... Nearly all the schools have that they 
have to go out and work with practitioners

11:47.532 --> 11:55.504
anywhere from a month to six months. And that's 
very good because they learn economics. They

12:02.294 --> 12:11.108
learn location, locating practices, how 
important that is, where you make your building.

12:11.128 --> 12:14.072
And they learn relationship with people. They 
don't get any of that in schools. And it's very

12:16.608 --> 12:18.269
vital. You know, you can make it break. I hired a 
veterinarian down here, a valedictorian in

12:20.631 --> 12:30.420
Colorado, and he'd gone broke in Longview, Tyler, 
Texas. Don't print it, but he was held up in a clinic

12:31.260 --> 12:38.547
I'd bought. And he made a living, that's all, for 
the clinic and himself. And he decided, Dr. Sears

12:43.211 --> 12:45.973
said, He's a very intelligent guy and has a very 
intelligent wife. She was head of her sorority at

12:50.769 --> 12:54.372
the University of Texas. And he said, I'm not happy 
here. I want to do some transplant work. And I've

13:00.459 --> 13:05.744
already done a little bit moving muscles here to 
take care of breaks and stuff. I said, could I do

13:06.625 --> 13:13.152
some college work at TCU and apply to med school? I 
said, well, certainly. And in about a year and a

13:14.945 --> 13:22.576
half, he was admitted to Dallas at the university 
over there. And when he graduated, he took four of

13:23.758 --> 13:29.566
the six honors that they had. And he's now teaching 
in San Antonio Medical School. And he's written

13:34.573 --> 13:40.361
the authoritative book of the Bible, they say. And 
I had a neighbor that was in it, an orthopedic for

13:40.401 --> 13:44.547
children. Showed me off the beach. That was his 
thing. But I just tell you that everybody is not

13:47.952 --> 13:53.196
suited for a practice. It's better that they learn 
that and getting out and trying it in practice

13:53.737 --> 14:00.283
before they enter into it. Or learn it early. 
That's something you don't learn in school

14:00.943 --> 14:02.585
either. No, not a bit. And I've kind of picked that 
up in a lot of conversations I've had with people.

14:07.189 --> 14:12.253
And that is, in practice, you're treating the 
client as much as you're treating the animal. Oh,

14:12.373 --> 14:12.954
you bet. You bet. The psychology of it. And that's 
hard to teach your young vets, too. They're

14:18.456 --> 14:27.024
terribly skilled, but they want to listen to the 
people and get what they... Sometimes they'll

14:27.064 --> 14:31.268
come in and talk one way, but they really want 
something else. Bring in an old dog and say, oh,

14:31.848 --> 14:35.572
yes, do everything you can. Then they ask you about 
the price, and you know underneath they want to put

14:36.232 --> 14:41.697
him to sleep, but they won't say it. You just can't 
quite come to it. When I was first here, I thought I

14:45.277 --> 14:55.368
was the euthanasia veterinarian because they'd 
take it to the regular veterinarian, but they

14:45.277 --> 14:55.368
didn't have a nurse enough to tell him to put him to 
sleep. There's one old Puerto Rican veterinarian

14:56.149 --> 15:02.396
here who wouldn't put the dog to sleep if he had 
cancer of the throat. He just wouldn't put him to

15:02.916 --> 15:04.198
sleep. I was taught to save him, not put him to 
sleep. I agree with him, but anyway, eventually

15:09.243 --> 15:14.389
that caught up. They have a tendency to take it to 
another veterinarian when they want to do that.

15:20.415 --> 15:22.157
Yeah, that's interesting.

15:25.240 --> 15:28.143
But I think they're accustomed to the client 
relationship. But I want to not leave you an

15:28.163 --> 15:32.788
impression I'm critical of women. No, I don't see 
that. But I do see that the nature of the

15:34.811 --> 15:40.377
competition, the nature of the business is 
changing because women are in it. And they've

15:40.863 --> 15:44.527
helped us because they're more gentle with dogs. 
And a lot of women would rather bring them to a woman

15:44.627 --> 15:49.092
than to a man. And they are just as good in surgery. I 
had one here that did three months work with me and

15:56.440 --> 16:07.191
then came to me as a veterinarian.

16:08.656 --> 16:13.063
And I've never had a sharper person that I could 
talk over a case. We would enjoy working together

16:13.884 --> 16:16.688
all night. But one didn't think the other would. 
And a fellow bought me out. And he didn't jive with

16:23.138 --> 16:24.240
her. And he'd been my partner, too. He was in his 
practice at the same time she was there. And I

16:29.388 --> 16:34.015
recommended it to his brother, who had another 
partnership practice I'd had. And she's with him

16:35.116 --> 16:37.600
and her right-hand man. And she carried a lot of 
practice over there with her. When she left mine, I

16:41.994 --> 16:47.859
never could understand why this didn't work out. 
Well, they had another fellow they wanted to bring

16:48.259 --> 16:54.985
in, and primarily couldn't afford two of them. The 
other fellow was not her caliber at all. I

16:59.349 --> 17:03.292
interviewed Anelda Bates in San Antonio. I don't 
know if you remember her. She's apparently one of

17:04.913 --> 17:08.076
the early practitioners in Texas. came out of 
Purdue, I believe. I had an Illinois one, and I

17:11.908 --> 17:17.917
hired her as a substitute lots of times. She was 
very good. Worked out of Dallas. I guess we better

17:20.981 --> 17:32.617
go ahead and close then, but if you were going to 
write a book on veterinary medicine, what do you

17:20.981 --> 17:32.617
think would be the main thing you would want to 
express or explain in that book? I would think that

17:32.637 --> 17:37.945
of our

17:39.376 --> 17:47.049
Dentistry and MDs, DOs,

17:39.376 --> 17:47.049
we have kept pace with them. We have been leaders in 
some. And we're not to be,

17:51.678 --> 18:01.735
take a second seat to them in the practice of 
medicine in any respect. I really think that then

18:06.359 --> 18:13.667
your medicine has done proud for itself with not 
too much help.

18:18.572 --> 18:23.698
And this is the main thing that the public needs to 
know, you think? I think so. I'm very active in

18:24.719 --> 18:31.206
Morris Animal Foundation now. And it is a group 
that is headquartered in Denver. started by Dr.

18:35.671 --> 18:43.442
Morris, who invented KD, RD, and all these special 
diets that veterinarians use. And it is dedicated

18:45.204 --> 18:55.078
to research

18:45.204 --> 18:55.078
in animal diseases that are not covered by the US 
government. And that means dog, cat, horse, and

18:55.098 --> 19:05.593
zoo.

19:05.810 --> 19:18.128
I feel that it's a very beneficial thing, and they 
do more research through the colleges, through

19:05.810 --> 19:18.128
the veterinary colleges. They fund research. 
They fund research than anyone else in the United

19:19.590 --> 19:22.895
States. Cornell is second, and it drops off 
terribly up in there. The Texas and AVMA and AHA

19:30.666 --> 19:35.293
have copied it But they don't have anything like 
the money spent. Yeah. I gather that's one of the, I

19:41.777 --> 19:45.681
read the Pew report, and I think that's one of them. 
Yeah. Give them a plug, because they deserve it.

19:49.245 --> 19:49.345
Yeah. Dr. Morris gave a certain percent of his 
profits to this organization. One of my clients

19:55.893 --> 20:02.260
here was president, president of the board of 
directors. and very active in setting up a fund,

20:03.185 --> 20:09.531
which they do. They pay for the research off the 
income from this fund. It's a stable fund, and the

20:16.357 --> 20:26.706
fund pays enough interest money that they do not 
have to enter into the principal. And the state

20:28.068 --> 20:32.972
board, as a member of the state veterinary board, 
at one time as an honor for being that. And I enjoyed

20:38.056 --> 20:43.682
that relationship with my clients. The state TVMA 
doesn't have money or resources to fund research

20:44.082 --> 20:49.628
projects. Very much. They have a little bit. I know 
the foundation is trying to develop in that area.

20:55.774 --> 20:58.036
Well, Fort Worth had its own foundation. Is that 
right? We formed it very soon after the Morris

20:58.877 --> 21:03.702
Animal Foundation And we have $60,000

21:04.407 --> 21:17.746
that this man gave us in the bank right now to devote 
to research and to... We've spent a lot... For a

21:04.407 --> 21:17.746
local organization, that's very good. Well, 
we're the only one, practically in the United

21:17.766 --> 21:23.895
States, that we also set up our own loan fund. If 
you'll check at the college down there, we have had

21:24.475 --> 21:32.727
and still maintain a loan fund for veterinary 
students. That was part of our...

21:35.202 --> 21:52.036
Is there a sense, you think, in the profession now 
that too many veterinarians are coming out into

21:35.202 --> 21:52.036
the practice through... Well, I've been on a 
long-range planning committee twice several

21:35.202 --> 21:52.036
years back, and now I'm on it now. And that's a 
continual problem. I would... I think so. You can

21:58.942 --> 22:03.085
hire veterinarians pretty cheap now compared 
to... four or five years ago, and yet the good ones

22:03.352 --> 22:11.102
are bringing good salary. I have two daughters in 
dietetics, and they don't fall into a

22:11.803 --> 22:29.365
veterinarian's price range, a graduating one, 
and a graduating dietitian, and it's about the

22:11.803 --> 22:29.365
same amount of school work. Theirs has come up 
fast, too. I had one other thing I wanted to mention

22:33.119 --> 22:37.543
to you. I alluded to it back there with Glenn Savage 
and King. I had to fire King's organization

22:43.588 --> 22:50.935
because Dr. Cloud, my treasurer,

22:51.015 --> 23:01.624
thought we were getting the shaft as far as 
expenses. He came in and doubled the dues the first

23:02.701 --> 23:12.016
month he was in. He got it passed through. And then 
he wanted to double them again in two years' time

23:13.859 --> 23:22.032
that every member paid. And we found out, well, you 
forced an audit, Dr. Cloud and I. on to him, and I

23:30.173 --> 23:35.560
have letters and all kinds of things through the 
years brought along. And he fought it all the way.

23:39.605 --> 23:47.475
What he would do is put out printing, charge us one 
price, and pay them about half. And he'd do it

23:48.216 --> 23:59.691
different with his charges, his work that he did, 
slides work, and stuff like that, much up from what

23:59.941 --> 24:06.549
Well, anyway, at the same time, he had us as his 
executive secretary. He's the executive

24:07.330 --> 24:16.582
secretary of the Texas Cattle Racers Association 
and Texas Truckers Association and several more.

24:18.344 --> 24:29.138
Both of those sued him after we fired him and won 
their court trials. This didn't get much

24:29.337 --> 24:31.460
publicity. And I got some criticism from it. 
Sounded like you did the right thing without any

24:34.764 --> 24:37.268
reservation. Yeah. And I have lots of letters and 
proof and so forth. Yeah, I'm sure that was a tough

24:40.172 --> 24:41.834
time for you to do. He wrote me a letter that in 
effect said that I was going to apologize to him,

24:42.074 --> 24:57.235
accept his audit, and rehire him, or he's going to 
send it to every member of the state association

24:57.923 --> 24:59.865
And he called me a SOB. And he gave me a time from 
Thursday till Sunday to give him a signed copy of a

25:00.926 --> 25:13.219
different letter that he wanted me to send. And I 
got the letter and came in, got the old business,

25:14.280 --> 25:19.745
came home for lunch. Well, I said, what in the world 
happened to you? He said, you look funny. I said,

25:24.250 --> 25:25.551
well, read this letter. And she said, does he mean 
that? Said he's going to send it to every member.

25:30.366 --> 25:31.407
I've got a copy here. To the association. If I 
didn't notify him by Saturday noon. And she says,

25:39.316 --> 25:40.658
what are you going to do? And I said, I'm going to 
Abilene. And she said, what the hell are you going

25:43.461 --> 25:46.144
to Abilene for? I said, that won't solve this 
problem. I said, well, he can't call me. And I said,

25:51.070 --> 25:53.413
I'm going to call his bluff. I said, if he sends that 
out, I'm going to sue him. And he knows all of a

25:56.227 --> 25:58.610
sudden. And he said, that's Mark. Well, I did. And 
he didn't, nothing came of it. But he accepted it

26:04.178 --> 26:18.859
with ill grace and continually wrote my board and 
wrote the board of directors and the officers

26:04.178 --> 26:18.859
without sending me copies and stuff. But we got rid 
of him. And about five years, he went crazy and

26:20.681 --> 26:24.647
died. early. He had a mental problem. He was trying 
to go too far. That's hard. That's hard on you, too.

26:34.311 --> 26:36.414
I won't do anything without... Some of us remember 
it, but the people following me and Julef down

26:37.857 --> 26:46.649
at... Yeah, I've talked to him. He was the one that 
hired him. And he was... Well, Julef realizes what

26:48.612 --> 26:53.059
it got into me. I think we're through. We've got 
company coming.
