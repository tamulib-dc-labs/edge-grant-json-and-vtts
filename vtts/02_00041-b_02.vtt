WEBVTT

00:01.938 --> 00:04.081
impressed me the most was Warner Von Braun.

00:06.204 --> 00:27.692
He gave an illustration which I've never forgotten but he was talking about going to the moon and of course this is when people were still talking and he said to give you an idea of what it takes to go to the moon if you had seven diesel train engines on the track out there and you could harness

00:28.178 --> 00:37.229
all that power at one time, that's how much power it takes to pump the fuel to the engines of a rocket to go to the moon.

00:37.249 --> 00:38.371
I've never forgotten that.

00:41.414 --> 00:43.697
Let's see, did Eisenhower come here while you were?

00:43.717 --> 00:44.378
Yes, he did.

00:44.398 --> 00:45.439
He sure did.

00:45.479 --> 00:56.633
Eisenhower came here and spoke and I remember that and he was very impressive.

00:58.334 --> 01:09.051
Growing up here, what was it like to go to Silver Taps for you?

01:10.013 --> 01:14.600
I've always thought Silver Taps was one of the most impressive traditions that A&M has.

01:15.682 --> 01:18.486
Nearly every time they had that, I would go to the dorm and

01:19.040 --> 01:28.519
be there with somebody and they'd turn the lights out and we'd all walk out and listen to Silver Taps and then turn around and go back and I'd get in the car and go back home.

01:29.861 --> 01:33.088
But I was always very, very impressed with Silver Taps.

01:33.168 --> 01:35.532
I just, I loved that ceremony.

01:35.552 --> 01:40.582
Do you remember anybody ever deliberately not respecting the police?

01:40.903 --> 01:40.963
No.

01:41.753 --> 01:45.758
What about Muster?

01:45.778 --> 01:49.402
Muster as an undergraduate was not that significant to me.

01:49.442 --> 01:53.487
I think it only became a little significant a little later.

01:53.527 --> 01:57.171
That's the impression I have.

01:58.733 --> 02:05.761
And of course it become more and more important but as an undergraduate I didn't quite have much feel for Muster.

02:06.342 --> 02:07.103
Y'all practice?

02:07.859 --> 02:10.503
Very interesting, fun.

02:12.345 --> 02:24.182
About that time it began to get a little rowdy, and I had to watch that a little bit, which I didn't care for, but it was always a fun time.

02:24.242 --> 02:27.006
Was it held in the stadium?

02:28.007 --> 02:31.432
Yeah, they had moved it to the stadium.

02:32.393 --> 02:37.360
The football games in the student section,

02:37.795 --> 02:42.041
Were they rowdy during your day, your undergraduate?

02:42.061 --> 02:43.663
No, I don't ever remember them being rowdy.

02:47.909 --> 02:51.433
Other final review?

02:51.453 --> 02:52.395
Big time.

02:52.675 --> 02:55.278
I always enjoyed the final review.

02:55.299 --> 03:03.870
I always thought that that was very special, a special time and a fun time, and that was also one of my favorite ceremonies.

03:04.627 --> 03:07.631
You and I both were in college during the Korean War.

03:09.434 --> 03:15.523
As you were getting ready to graduate, what did you think was just ahead of you?

03:15.543 --> 03:28.222
Well, I was very concerned about going to war or being in combat and really did not want to go overseas.

03:30.285 --> 03:31.967
But I thought for sure I was going.

03:35.035 --> 03:37.297
and I ended up going to Washington instead.

03:37.358 --> 03:49.270
They took our military class and sent a third of them to Korea, a third of them to Asmara, and a third of them to Washington.

03:49.831 --> 03:55.177
I happened to be one of the ones that went to Washington.

03:55.197 --> 03:57.479
Final review your senior year, who came?

03:59.081 --> 03:59.602
Can't tell you.

04:01.063 --> 04:01.684
No, from your family.

04:01.884 --> 04:02.865
Oh, from my family?

04:05.461 --> 04:13.634
I think my mother came, but that's about it.

04:19.824 --> 04:26.935
As you are, during these years, were you involved with Bonfire at all?

04:27.216 --> 04:31.182
Yes, I worked, particularly my sophomore year,

04:31.685 --> 04:33.970
I worked very, very hard on the bonfire.

04:33.990 --> 04:45.897
In fact, I went and got a winch truck and used it to stack logs, and I worked hours and hours and hours on that bonfire.

04:46.366 --> 04:53.478
As I remember, they got started late because the weather was bad and they just couldn't figure out how to stack the logs.

04:54.459 --> 05:02.873
And it occurred to me if you took a winch truck with gin poles that you could pick a log up and turn it and back that truck right up and stack that log.

05:03.258 --> 05:20.083
And so I went and borrowed a winch truck from the people that I had been working for, and we picked up the bigger logs that were hard to carry and turned them and stuck the end of the log under the tailgate, and then would back right up into the stack.

05:20.103 --> 05:28.615
And, you know, a lot of the guys didn't really know what a winch truck was, and I was kind of proud of myself because I knew how to operate it.

05:29.617 --> 05:31.680
And I stacked many a log that year.

05:32.041 --> 05:33.062
Where was the cutting area?

05:34.527 --> 05:39.553
The cutting area that year was down towards Wilburn, but I don't know exactly whose land it was.

05:39.573 --> 05:44.178
By then you all had started using only logs, not trash.

05:44.359 --> 05:45.680
Correct.

05:45.700 --> 05:49.385
And the bonfire site was where?

05:49.545 --> 05:53.890
I mean the drill field.

05:53.910 --> 05:55.892
Drill field.

05:55.912 --> 05:59.316
And where did the outhouse come from?

05:59.336 --> 06:01.579
I don't know who got that outhouse.

06:01.939 --> 06:02.560
Was it a real outhouse?

06:02.810 --> 06:03.952
Yeah, sure was.

06:04.473 --> 06:05.635
We used to go out and steal them.

06:06.957 --> 06:08.339
But it was a real outhouse.

06:10.703 --> 06:13.828
And did you all have the same kind of lingo now?

06:13.848 --> 06:15.251
Were there red pots?

06:15.271 --> 06:22.102
Yeah, I don't know that it was quite that organized, but there was definitely an organization.

06:23.124 --> 06:28.513
And you used tape and things to identify what outfits there were.

06:29.287 --> 06:34.071
And what, as you look back on it, what was the value of people being involved?

06:34.091 --> 06:41.437
I think just the organizational skills and the camaraderie of being able to do something that you don't think you can do.

06:43.699 --> 06:52.707
And as far as I'm aware, in modern times, everything that goes into the bonfire is donated very willingly.

06:52.727 --> 06:56.090
The equipment, the fuel, the logs.

06:58.131 --> 06:58.872
Yeah.

07:00.573 --> 07:13.688
freshman year, I think, we had a guy killed as far as the bonfire was concerned and that put a damper on things, but it was a car wreck.

07:13.728 --> 07:18.073
He got out, he was serving coffee and he got out and there's a car came up and hit him from behind.

07:21.877 --> 07:24.260
Let's see, Aggie Ring.

07:26.062 --> 07:28.605
Any Aggie Ring stories you can share?

07:29.345 --> 07:42.821
No, but I do think that the tradition or the program they have right now of recycling the rings is one of the best programs I know of.

07:42.901 --> 07:43.802
I just love that.

07:44.002 --> 07:44.883
I think it's wonderful.

07:48.447 --> 07:56.036
I love my ring and I want other people to have theirs too and I've been very proud of my Aggie ring.

07:56.417 --> 07:57.698
Do you remember what it cost?

08:00.833 --> 08:01.955
I want to say $45.

08:02.115 --> 08:11.830
And you've not lost it or have you been somewhere in an unusual place and somebody recognized it?

08:11.890 --> 08:12.671
All over the world.

08:14.073 --> 08:14.914
All over the world.

08:15.135 --> 08:16.016
People ask about that ring.

08:16.036 --> 08:19.241
When you were doing NFL games I presume that ring was there.

08:19.521 --> 08:24.168
Yes.

08:24.308 --> 08:29.997
I will tell you that from a unique standpoint as far as I know I'm the only person in the world that wears those two.

08:30.820 --> 08:32.362
Right now, what's the other one?

08:32.382 --> 08:36.286
It's Super Bowl ring.

08:36.307 --> 08:36.667
I assume that was.

08:36.687 --> 08:39.170
Are you the only, so you're the only Aggie?

08:39.971 --> 08:42.454
As officiated in the NFL, yeah.

08:42.474 --> 08:47.380
There's a good many have played, but as far as I know, I'm the only one that's ever officiated.

08:48.861 --> 08:50.523
Let's see.

08:51.805 --> 08:55.009
As a student, go back to indulgences.

08:56.791 --> 08:59.013
Remember students smoked cigarettes?

08:59.194 --> 08:59.494
Yes.

08:59.744 --> 09:02.228
Did students smoke cigars when you were an undergrad?

09:02.288 --> 09:03.249
No, I don't remember.

09:04.351 --> 09:04.831
Chew tobacco?

09:05.773 --> 09:13.083
Not much, a little bit, but there was some, but there was much more chewing than there was dipping.

09:14.765 --> 09:17.449
And whiskey?

09:19.083 --> 09:24.771
I don't remember an awful lot except on trips and things like that.

09:25.873 --> 09:29.277
I don't remember going into the dorms or anything and drinking whiskey.

09:29.297 --> 09:35.626
And you didn't, as an undergraduate, you and your friends didn't know anything about what we today call drugs.

09:37.008 --> 09:39.111
Never heard of.

09:39.131 --> 09:42.456
That would certainly be true in my case.

09:44.559 --> 09:47.503
Let's see, we're getting near the end.

09:48.361 --> 09:59.332
When you were preparing to leave campus after graduation, what sort of world did you think you were going to be entering?

09:59.453 --> 10:07.841
I thought it was a very challenging world and I thought it was very exciting and I was very interested in going out and trying to make something happen.

10:09.403 --> 10:13.187
I thought there was a lot of opportunity out there, I didn't know how

10:13.673 --> 10:18.840
to get involved in it or how to take advantage of it, but I'm sure is that going to give it a try.

10:19.580 --> 10:22.484
Did you think you were going to be in insurance business?

10:22.504 --> 10:24.646
No, I had absolutely no idea.

10:26.549 --> 10:46.414
I turned down an offer with IBM because I thought that if I was successful, the only place I could end up was in New York, and I didn't want to live in New York, I didn't think, so I turned that down.

10:46.799 --> 10:50.665
A commissioned salesman is something that I just thought that was crazy.

10:50.745 --> 10:52.408
I never dreamed I would do that.

10:53.089 --> 10:54.571
What was your first job?

10:54.591 --> 10:58.076
My first job went to work for Shell Oil Company in their personnel department.

10:59.619 --> 11:03.324
Did A&M have any effect on your getting that job?

11:03.344 --> 11:03.965
I think so.

11:04.085 --> 11:05.768
Did they come here or did you go there?

11:05.788 --> 11:07.330
No, they came to A&M.

11:08.773 --> 11:11.517
This would be the last salary.

11:11.717 --> 11:14.882
Do you remember what that first job salary was?

11:16.583 --> 11:18.125
I don't remember.

11:21.750 --> 11:24.474
Summary questions about A&M.

11:24.494 --> 11:27.138
What is it that creates Aggie spirit?

11:29.582 --> 11:43.502
I think the Aggie spirit is the relationship that the students have to each other, which is, I'm not sure, orchestrated or perpetuated.

11:44.596 --> 11:55.229
or what by the school itself, but it's the friendship, the fellowship, the kindredship that you have for your fellow student.

11:56.330 --> 11:59.273
Are there some events that contribute to that?

11:59.293 --> 12:12.409
I think certainly things like the bonfire football games, all the extracurricular activities, the classroom itself, all

12:13.722 --> 12:27.857
contribute to it, but I think one of the principal reasons is the fact that A&M in its wisdom, whatever it's done, has allowed the student to be in charge of so much.

12:28.698 --> 12:36.846
I mean, ever going back to when I'm a student and when you go out here today and you get involved in a program or whatever it might be, it's all run by the students.

12:37.587 --> 12:41.451
And I think the leadership training that they provide out there is the best I know.

12:45.143 --> 12:48.367
All right.

12:48.387 --> 12:49.108
What did it mean?

12:49.248 --> 12:53.554
What has it meant to you, to your life, that you went to Indiana?

12:53.654 --> 12:54.455
I think pride.

12:54.515 --> 12:57.459
Pride in a great school.

12:57.519 --> 13:14.560
The ability to find comrades wherever you might be who you started out with a leg up because they were Aggies.

13:17.999 --> 13:24.128
Let's make believe someone gave you tomorrow a check for a million dollars.

13:25.751 --> 13:27.694
And there was only one condition on that gift.

13:27.754 --> 13:30.939
You had to pass it on to Texas A&M.

13:30.959 --> 13:36.227
But you could decide what was to be done with it.

13:36.247 --> 13:39.772
What would you want it spent for?

13:39.792 --> 13:41.695
Well, I think the President's endowed...

13:42.552 --> 13:48.428
scholarships are one of the best things that A&M has because they're not any

13:49.100 --> 13:51.582
requirements particularly for that scholarship.

13:51.662 --> 14:01.131
I don't like the requirements that your parents can't have so much money or that grades.

14:01.151 --> 14:12.422
The President's Endowed Scholarship, as I understand it, is a merit scholarship and the merits are that somebody thinks you'll make a good Aggie and I really like that idea.

14:13.623 --> 14:17.166
On the other hand, I would also like to contribute

14:17.568 --> 14:23.764
to some of the organizations that I think

14:25.567 --> 14:39.330
perhaps have not received quite as much notoriety and they would be in fields that I really don't have anything to do with.

14:39.350 --> 14:49.768
It might be horticulture or agronomy or some of those things but something that

14:53.005 --> 14:55.388
Maybe some seed money of some type.

14:55.768 --> 15:01.595
But the President's Endowed Scholarships, to me, are just about as fine as anything I know.

15:03.617 --> 15:05.099
Then I request.

15:06.220 --> 15:21.358
If you ever have any papers, any stuff, any memorabilia you want to share, either to give the originals or copies, I beg you, please put it in the A&M archives that are in the Cushing Library.

15:22.958 --> 15:24.620
I probably have some stuff.

15:24.740 --> 15:29.526
I've got a good bit of stuff from Daddy's tenure.

15:30.968 --> 15:39.619
Like if you wanted to just make copies for you and other members of the family and give them a copy, fine.

15:40.360 --> 15:42.663
But those items are priceless.

15:42.783 --> 15:45.867
They cannot be found anywhere else, probably.

15:46.568 --> 15:50.873
And the best place for them to be organized and preserved and available is there.

15:51.646 --> 15:56.952
And when we get through with these and you get to edit it, we will put a copy there.

15:57.173 --> 16:04.802
Yeah, I have in the drawer in there, and Jimmy may have given you one, but there's a 1935 College Station phone directory.

16:06.664 --> 16:11.930
You haven't seen that?

16:11.950 --> 16:12.711
We're back.

16:13.352 --> 16:13.452
Okay.

16:15.001 --> 16:21.234
But I always make that plea so that those things don't get thrown away.

16:21.554 --> 16:28.068
Because many times somebody will get to the point where, oh, well, this is just old stuff and I'll throw it away.

16:29.691 --> 16:32.657
So in summary, the last question.

16:33.499 --> 16:36.705
What feelings do you hold in your heart for Texas A&M now?

16:38.288 --> 16:41.892
I think Texas A&M is a great school.

16:42.693 --> 16:53.006
I think that A&M has probably done as good a job as anybody anywhere maintaining some of the traditions that made A&M what it is.

16:54.268 --> 17:01.577
And I'm very pleased that they're trying very hard to maintain as many of those traditions as possible.

17:02.678 --> 17:06.743
I believe A&M, in spite of it being as big as it is, is a special place.

17:07.567 --> 17:15.437
And I think that it has a special place in the heart of its graduates for other graduates and new people to come to A&M.

17:16.379 --> 17:26.352
And the fact that it's willing to help those graduates as much as it is, I believe that each graduate owes to A&M a whole lot.

17:26.872 --> 17:37.454
because the ability to get a job or to get an interview or whatever, I believe is better at A&M because of the record that its former students have created.

17:37.494 --> 17:41.623
And to me, that's the legacy that makes A&M so strong.
