WEBVTT

00:07.996 --> 00:13.823
Yeah, we'll talk a little bit, and then I'll go back 
and test it, and then we'll start over again. And

00:14.464 --> 00:15.405
this is how I'm going to start out. This is an 
interview with Mr. Kerry Colley by Danny West on

00:16.006 --> 00:25.899
April 29, 1991, at his place of business in Bryan, 
Texas, concerning the civil rights movement. In

00:26.760 --> 00:34.450
the interest of accumulating knowledge, I am 
asking you to donate these tapes to me or to the

00:26.760 --> 00:34.450
Texas A&M Oral History Collection in the 
University Archives. Is that all right with you?

00:35.471 --> 00:36.212
That's fine. Okay.

00:42.033 --> 00:44.297
First, I'm going to just ask a couple of background 
questions. First of all, where and when were you

00:45.659 --> 00:48.584
born? On November 4, 1941, in Brunner, Alabama. 
Okay. And where were you raised? Were you raised in

00:55.215 --> 00:56.217
Alabama? Alabama. Until when did you move to 
Texas? I came to Texas in 62. 62. Oh, okay, good. I

01:05.152 --> 01:08.277
have a question to ask you later on that maybe 
you'll be able to answer that one, too. And since

01:09.455 --> 01:15.185
you were raised in the South, I assume that whites 
and blacks attended both segregated schools.

01:15.205 --> 01:16.206
Correct. How did the white schools compare with 
the black schools? There was no comparison. There

01:22.116 --> 01:24.320
was no comparison. Our school had a potbellied 
stove with coal, and it was wooden structure that

01:24.340 --> 01:32.273
was... appeared to be hundreds of years old. And 
the white school was a nice brick structure with

01:36.518 --> 01:43.388
central heating and what have you. The books that 
we received were like hand-me-down books. They

01:52.682 --> 02:00.513
were books that were out of date, books that had 
adopted a new set. And we got the older books. Even

02:03.910 --> 02:11.257
basketball was played outdoors at our school on 
the ground. We didn't have a gym. There were gyms

02:14.119 --> 02:18.003
and things like this at the white school. So that 
was a marked difference between the schools. Were

02:23.548 --> 02:28.012
those schools ever integrated before you left? 
No. Were they long after? Long, long after. They

02:32.978 --> 02:36.041
were some of the last to be integrated. And today 
there, what they've done to get around

02:36.902 --> 02:50.454
integration, only the poor whites go to the county 
and the city schools. The middle and upper class

02:51.576 --> 03:00.664
whites go to an academy, a private academy that has 
been established. Let's see. Okay, this is the one

03:04.051 --> 03:07.516
I was going to ask you about, maybe you knew about 
locally. Locally, I was talking with my teacher,

03:08.317 --> 03:17.389
and he said that he heard that the Bryan High School 
was burned down, or that it burned down, and that's

03:08.317 --> 03:17.389
how they ended up integrating the school system. I 
was not in 62. I was teaching school at the time. I

03:21.074 --> 03:22.756
was in 70. Here in... 69, yes. It didn't burn. The 
Bryan High School didn't burn down. That was

03:29.064 --> 03:29.925
the... Old Bryant, the original Old Bryant 
colored high, which was at that time was an

03:30.209 --> 03:43.425
elementary school, Washington Elementary, 
which is right across the street here, where this

03:30.209 --> 03:43.425
park is now. It burned. And I taught at Neal Junior 
High, which was the old Kemp High school. It

03:53.798 --> 03:54.539
burned. It was all within the same year. Oh, 
really? Yeah. Within the same year. Less than six

04:00.230 --> 04:01.812
months apart. And did they have to, what did they do 
after, did they? Well, at first, we were crowded

04:05.395 --> 04:09.259
into the black schools. And as a result of these 
schools burning, though, it speeded up the

04:10.200 --> 04:16.326
process of integration. At the time, Bryan was in a 
grade-a-year plan to integrate the schools.

04:24.353 --> 04:29.038
There was an old system devised by the South to 
delay integration as much as possible. So if you

04:31.714 --> 04:36.701
went to court, you could get, say, well, we'll 
integrate one grade a year. Right, OK. And also at

04:37.002 --> 04:58.114
that time, a lawsuit had been filed by the NAACP, a 
gentleman that lives right up here on the corner,

04:37.002 --> 04:58.114
Jaylev Thomas, because of his son, Clarence 
Thomas, who wanted to go to the schools here. And as

04:58.718 --> 05:11.558
a result of that, the court suit and the fires and 
all the things that were happening at the time, the

04:58.718 --> 05:11.558
schools weren't

04:58.718 --> 05:11.558
integrated. How did blacks feel, for the most 
part, about integration at the time? I mean, did

05:16.967 --> 05:19.691
they want to do that? To answer you honestly, not 
really. But the only way that they felt that they

05:26.478 --> 05:41.521
could get an equal school with a quality 
education, same facility, was to go to the same

05:26.478 --> 05:41.521
school. You can't have, no two things are exactly 
alike. You can't have separate and equal.

05:49.273 --> 05:55.422
Separate is, as the Supreme Court has said, the end 
of itself is unequal. There were some blacks who

05:56.060 --> 06:02.326
wanted to go to the white schools. There were some 
that didn't. There were a lot of fears and

06:05.809 --> 06:09.392
pressures on the blacks at the time. But in spite of 
those fears and pressures, they felt that for

06:09.973 --> 06:22.945
their children, and the children felt for 
themselves, that it was the best thing that could

06:09.973 --> 06:22.945
have happened. How did you perceive whites to feel 
about it? Were they just as scared about it? They

06:31.124 --> 06:33.446
had anxieties, too. And there were some who

06:33.466 --> 06:41.433
looked down on blacks. And this is my personal 
feeling from what I saw and observed. You had the

06:48.359 --> 06:53.944
elite group. And most of the towns in the south, 
they leave whites. We kind of ran the town. And the

07:02.103 --> 07:05.807
poor whites were just as bad off as the blacks. They 
just didn't realize it. But the only thing that

07:07.789 --> 07:15.597
they had that was better than the blacks was that 
they were white. And they felt like, you know, I'm

07:22.055 --> 07:34.256
speculating on this, that if my child goes to 
school with this black child, then somehow it

07:22.055 --> 07:34.256
brings us down a lot too. So that was a tremendous 
resistance to it.

07:41.068 --> 07:45.275
One of the books that we talked about, I don't know 
if you've heard of it before, it's called Black

07:41.068 --> 07:45.275
Like Me. Yeah, Ralph Ellison. Yeah. And we read 
that, and one of the quotes in there is he was just

07:47.620 --> 08:04.777
talking about how just after a few days, how he'd 
been in the South, he said that it just became very

07:47.620 --> 08:04.777
obvious to him that the black man knew nothing 
about the white man, and the white man was totally

07:47.620 --> 08:04.777
ignorant of the black man, also that they were 
ignorant of each other. Two separate societies.

08:07.200 --> 08:08.301
How do you feel about that? Well, he's correct. 
There did exist two separate societies.

08:20.493 --> 08:27.644
I may be a little bit, in one sense, a little bit more 
fortunate than some other blacks. My granddad and

08:27.664 --> 08:32.893
my great granddad were both land owners. And my dad 
was in business. And as a result of the respect that

08:38.021 --> 08:45.893
my granddad had and my dad had acquired in their 
separate communities, there was some

08:46.143 --> 08:55.496
interaction.

08:56.658 --> 08:59.382
Also, my great-grandmother. Between the white? 
Between my family, and so I knew some of the white

09:00.623 --> 09:06.452
man's ways. My great-grandmother and my 
grandmother's dads were white.

09:18.762 --> 09:31.038
And there were some whites who did look out for 
their offspring.

09:31.799 --> 09:41.251
But my granddad was black, Jamaican, and there 
were the two separate societies. In spite of, in

09:41.431 --> 09:48.280
one sense of the word, not being as economically or 
educationally deprived as a lot of blacks were. I

09:51.636 --> 09:53.598
still knew there were two separate worlds. I only, 
and I still was looked at, or we were still appeared

09:54.299 --> 10:02.170
at in that subservient role. But because of the 
strength of those things and

10:03.211 --> 10:15.988
the callers tended to know a little bit more about 
the black man. I mean the white man than the average

10:16.660 --> 10:21.346
black man. Because my parents, my grandparents 
both had college degrees. Oh, they did? Yeah,

10:28.756 --> 10:31.420
Tuskegee Institute. So, consequently, my 
grandmother was a teacher. My grandfather on my

10:38.330 --> 10:42.535
father's side had little or no education. But on my 
mother's side, both my mother's parents were. I

10:46.563 --> 10:51.570
graduated from the College of Tuskegee 
Institute. So that put you in just a different

10:51.590 --> 10:55.996
perspective than a lot of others. Yeah, somewhat 
different perspective, even though there were

10:56.016 --> 11:07.312
things that happened to my family that equalized 
the situation. Like my father's business was

11:08.354 --> 11:16.485
burned, which equalizes the banks. wouldn't loan 
him money, he had to leave and go to another state to

11:17.225 --> 11:23.073
make some money to come back and reestablish 
himself. So, you know, I was in one sense, and I

11:24.315 --> 11:30.884
wasn't in the other sense. So.

11:35.991 --> 11:38.895
Now, I just wanted to ask you a little bit about 
voting. And were you registered to vote when you

11:39.656 --> 11:44.363
when you became of legal age or? Yes, I was 
registered. My dad registered the vote. He did?

11:48.182 --> 11:50.725
One of the few blacks in Pike County. At one time, I 
was probably the only black in Pike County,

11:51.827 --> 11:56.493
Alabama, that was registered. Did he have to take 
one of the understanding tests? I went with him.

12:00.299 --> 12:00.619
Really? And they asked him a bunch of crazy 
questions. Specific little Article 2 section,

12:05.646 --> 12:09.111
that kind of thing? Well, this is kind of to show you 
the kind of thing that they're asking. I never will

12:12.457 --> 12:15.882
forget the answer my dad gave. What you had were 
people who themselves were uneducated, given

12:16.483 --> 12:28.222
these tests, and they asked my dad one question I 
remember just distinctly. How many bubbles were

12:28.843 --> 12:35.753
there in a bar, a four ounce bar of ivory soap? 
Really? What did he say? Well, my dad told him that

12:41.687 --> 12:55.239
he would have to measure the precise size of it and 
everything, but if you use the formula E equals MC

12:41.687 --> 12:55.239
squared, you can find it. And I asked him later on, 
what was that? E equals MC squared. He said, oh,

13:01.245 --> 13:02.646
they're dumb. They don't know the answers to their 
own questions. So they thought he knew what he was

13:06.249 --> 13:07.711
talking about. Yeah, they thought he knew what he 
was talking about. By God, he's a smart nigga.

13:17.880 --> 13:24.388
I wanted to ask you a little bit more about, now I 
wanted to ask you a little bit more about when you

13:17.880 --> 13:24.388
actually became involved in the Civil Rights 
Movement. When did you start becoming involved?

13:28.672 --> 13:34.238
My family became involved with the original Bush 
boycott. My dad in 1955. I was doing pretty well in

13:38.806 --> 13:41.168
business at the time. In Birmingham? No, in 
Brundage. I was not in Birmingham. Did they have

13:46.733 --> 13:49.476
Best Boy Cuts like that? No, it was in Montgomery 
only, where it originally began. My hometown is

13:54.941 --> 13:59.465
only about 52 miles from Montgomery. My mom and 
dad, I knew a lot about Montgomery because my

14:00.226 --> 14:07.513
little hometown only had about Well, they had less 
than 2,000 people. And we went to Montgomery to

14:10.631 --> 14:13.895
shop. Oh, I see. It was one of the few times that you 
went to, they had a Woolworth's there. And I could

14:21.584 --> 14:24.107
go in and eat hot dogs. Right. But there were two 
sections, black section and white section. So

14:29.593 --> 14:35.340
when this, and my parents were always involved 
with the NAACP.

14:36.704 --> 14:43.113
And the NAACP was the group that really was behind 
the boycott. Dr. King was just chosen. And Dr. King

14:46.478 --> 14:53.567
was chosen because he had not been tainted by the 
white power structure. What they did with most of

14:53.587 --> 14:58.094
the ministers, they like bought them off. And Dr. 
King was the new kid on the block. And the NAACP felt

15:02.580 --> 15:06.205
that he hadn't been there long enough. to be 
tainted. Ms. Rosa Parks herself was the secretary

15:07.944 --> 15:13.812
of the Montgomery Chapel of the NAACP. Oh, really? 
So the lady who refused to give up a seat. And this

15:18.358 --> 15:20.441
thing had been tried back in 54. I'm going to run the 
phone. OK. Rodney, take this with you up there. OK.

15:29.293 --> 15:35.702
In 54,

15:29.293 --> 15:35.702
I knew this because I remember my parents 
discussing and talking about it. You had no TV or

15:41.262 --> 15:44.087
radio at the time. And on top of that, I was a paper 
boy for my little hometown. For both sections, you

15:50.116 --> 15:53.141
had two papers. The white paper had one star. The 
black paper had two stars on it. But because my dad

15:58.810 --> 16:04.879
was an efficient person, he was allowed to deliver 
both. Oh. The white paper and the black paper. They

16:07.405 --> 16:09.027
trusted him with that? Yeah, well, but 
consequently, you got the opportunity to read

16:09.047 --> 16:15.794
what was in both papers. Uh-huh. And, uh, black 
paper had a slant to the knee for blacks. Really?

16:22.481 --> 16:24.423
And, you know, it had a different slant for whites. 
To keep him uninformed about... Right. Hold on a

16:28.107 --> 16:29.649
second. People want to hear? Oh, you just...

16:35.538 --> 16:36.920
They had kind of a slant. Yeah. Well, you know, to be 
a bit more specific, so my dad helped, you know, he

16:37.600 --> 16:49.394
sent money and a car to Montgomery, so they had 
transport.

16:49.674 --> 17:02.389
My first real, I never, my parents, even though 
they themselves were, you know, active in what

16:49.674 --> 17:02.389
they could do at the time, Most of the whites felt my 
dad was crazy, you know. But they tried to protect

17:08.218 --> 17:13.706
the children like any parent would do. And my dad, 
he told me when I left home going to Tuskegee, you

17:15.088 --> 17:22.458
know, not to get involved with anything. But then 
Dr. King came to a church off campus one night.

17:32.187 --> 17:47.001
We

17:32.187 --> 17:47.001
were just talking about, I wanted to ask you also 
about, you had said that your father sent some cars

17:32.187 --> 17:47.001
to Montgomery. You had read a little bit about 
that, about trying to get some alternative things

17:47.681 --> 17:52.706
for the buses. Yeah, well, my dad sent cars and 
money to the movement up there. Uh, what happened,

17:59.710 --> 18:07.599
they asked people all over Alabama, blacks all 
over Alabama, to help support these people. And,

18:08.620 --> 18:15.427
you know, naturally, economically, blacks, you 
know, were still relatively poor. Uh, were

18:16.869 --> 18:18.911
relatively, you know, poor. But they, those, you 
know, they spent what they could, a dollar. Right.

18:23.296 --> 18:27.701
You know, a quarter, fifty cents, you know, just a 
little bit. Sure. For every little bit of help.

18:28.742 --> 18:29.042
Right. And also they donated money for the court 
suits that followed.

18:41.683 --> 18:46.473
And so that's about the time already, that's when 
you started getting exposed to the pistol? Yeah,

18:46.493 --> 18:49.900
yeah, during that time. There were a lot of racial 
incidents that happened to me as a kid. There were

18:55.047 --> 18:56.930
things that happened to me as a kid. There were 
things that happened and things that didn't

18:56.950 --> 19:03.039
happen, you know, as a kid.

19:05.582 --> 19:10.409
You know, that let me know that I was different in 
some respects.

19:11.971 --> 19:19.161
Some things, though, made me know that I was also 
equal. I was even superior to some people.

19:25.569 --> 19:32.038
But there were things that kind of let you know

19:25.569 --> 19:32.038
where you stood. If you saw a white man coming down 
the street, a white woman, then you had to move off

19:32.078 --> 19:39.648
the side of the street and let them by. Or if a white 
lady had on shorts, you better not look at them. You

19:45.035 --> 19:48.540
might get put in jail.

19:50.596 --> 19:55.463
When I was a kid, my dad came to that town and bought 
property on the north side. And the town kind of

19:57.005 --> 19:59.409
grew around him. And he sold his land to anybody. So 
four houses down from us have a white family. Oh,

20:08.381 --> 20:10.124
really? And this kid, Winston, and I were like the 
same age. And we went. He was white. He was a white

20:20.408 --> 20:21.169
kid. And he went to a separate school. The kid next 
door was black, and the next door, immediately.

20:26.857 --> 20:37.491
But there was Winston, and then you had the Bars who 
lived a little bit further up

20:26.857 --> 20:37.491
north of us. On the same Main Street. My dad, which 
is unusual for a black to live on Main Street in a

20:38.993 --> 20:45.983
southern town, but it just happened that he They 
come there early and they bought the property

20:47.043 --> 20:49.867
early. And when nobody wanted it, when they built a 
highway through there and made the property, you

20:50.267 --> 20:57.256
know, badly. Right. Yeah.

21:02.102 --> 21:03.323
But there were things that happened. I saw kids. I 
saw one girl get her teeth knocked down. When we

21:10.092 --> 21:12.595
were little kids, I mean like 12 years old, because 
we were in line. What could provoke someone to do, I

21:14.846 --> 21:16.749
mean? Because you were black.

21:21.016 --> 21:22.639
The town is made like a Y. And I guess, if I could say. 
The town is made like a Y, like this is Main Street.

21:36.875 --> 21:42.783
If you come up here in 231 or take you to Troy, 
Alabama, it winds around it. You know, they had no

21:42.883 --> 21:45.486
rhyme or reason for the way they did. But they also 
had a highway where we lived, which was also Main

21:46.327 --> 21:52.675
Street. It came up this way. And kids, you know, 
this girl and I met at the Y. Not by chance. The

22:02.428 --> 22:03.068
little girl? The little girl. Uh-huh. My dad sent 
me to the post office, which is located up here, I

22:07.047 --> 22:16.817
guess about a half mile down. And town had two sides 
to it. And we went walking, looking in the windows

22:20.260 --> 22:29.470
on the various stores and everything down there. 
And

22:31.011 --> 22:35.616
I was late. We were late. because your parents 
didn't want you to stay out too long because they

22:37.405 --> 22:43.153
would probably whip you or something like that. We 
were standing in line at the post office to buy a

22:43.513 --> 22:46.096
stamp. And we were next up to the counter. And 
people kept coming around us, getting waiting on

22:51.423 --> 22:59.113
them. And they were whites. And this was like in the 
middle of the day. And so the blacks and most of them

23:03.119 --> 23:05.742
were working. And so, you know, the girl said, Mr., 
we're next, you know. And, you know, told us to shut

23:11.964 --> 23:13.466
up. And so three or four more people. And we weren't 
saying anything out of disrespect to them. We just

23:21.496 --> 23:23.439
didn't want to get a whipping when we got home. 
Right. And so she said, Mr., we're next, we're

23:24.360 --> 23:27.244
next. And he just reached over the counter and hit 
her in the mouth. Oh, to the post? The postmaster.

23:34.612 --> 23:54.639
And, you know, blood was everywhere, you know, and 
I said, well, you know, I told him, I said, well,

23:34.612 --> 23:54.639
sir, you didn't have to hit her, you know, and he 
reached over to hit me, but there was a white man

23:34.612 --> 23:54.639
there, and this white man called his hand and said, 
don't hit that boy. Well, that's Kerry Colley's

23:54.659 --> 23:56.201
son. Oh, man. But as I said, they thought my dad was 
crazy, because he didn't take anything off

23:58.726 --> 24:03.692
anybody. He was a crazy nigga. And he didn't work 
for whites either. So by virtue of that, he did do

24:08.999 --> 24:17.650
contract work, but he would not go and work an 8 to 5 
job. But anyway, that's it. So he didn't really

24:20.173 --> 24:23.598
have anybody to answer to or that could harass him? 
No. We sold out goods. We sold out goods to

24:26.421 --> 24:27.923
everybody. in the community, black and white, 
because my dad was the only store that opened at 5

24:28.426 --> 24:35.537
o'clock in the morning. And it was the only store 
that was open at night after 5 o'clock in the

24:35.557 --> 24:40.165
afternoon. So consequently, everybody bought 
from us. So they had another little thing in my

24:46.935 --> 24:52.784
hometown on Thursday at noon, everything closed. 
And his was the only store that was open.

24:57.907 --> 25:01.831
on, you know, Saturday evenings, or after church 
on Sunday, he'd open. I guess it's kind of the

25:02.912 --> 25:07.476
forerunner of the convenience store. But, you 
know, they knew him, and so that happened, but I

25:09.818 --> 25:18.706
have had incidents that were, did happen to me. So I 
knew in one sense where I stood, and I knew in

25:19.346 --> 25:25.832
another sense where I stood, too. But getting back 
to this... The first time I was involved, Dr. King

25:29.480 --> 25:32.885
came to the Tuskegee. And they told us not to go over 
to the president and everything. At your college?

25:44.443 --> 25:45.744
Yeah, I said, don't go over there. So we went 
anyway. You know, a bunch of kids. Right. You know,

25:49.290 --> 25:53.456
somebody tell you don't do something when you're a 
kid. You know, that's a thing that you really. Were

25:55.319 --> 25:56.921
you about 20-ish or not? No, I was only 17. I was a 
freshman at the time. Oh, okay. First year. And I

26:05.393 --> 26:06.775
went. And he spoke. And I feel like I had to march. 
You know, he was just that eloquent. A spokesman.

26:18.110 --> 26:18.831
Yeah. And, you know, he was saying what was 
happening in Tuskegee. In that county there, you

26:23.337 --> 26:29.085
had a county where Tuskegee dominated that 
county. like Texas A&M dominates, rather. And

26:33.626 --> 26:43.261
even though it was a black institution,

26:33.626 --> 26:43.261
you had a learned black population there. You had 
blacks with money and land. And you had a majority

26:48.989 --> 26:54.458
of the population was black. But the whites, 
through fear, kept the, I would just say the

26:58.107 --> 27:04.793
so-called locals, a lot like it is here, at bay, you 
know, with stuff. And it was the people, the

27:05.814 --> 27:17.805
average run-of-the-mill person that, you know, 
really the marchers benefited the most because

27:05.814 --> 27:17.805
you had, always had a black elite. People don't 
realize it, but you've always had a black elite.

27:22.229 --> 27:24.451
You even had blacks who owned slaves themselves. 
I'm sure you've all heard about that. But we went

27:26.862 --> 27:38.680
anyway, and Dr. King said something that night 
that stuck with me. Even though he said that we

27:38.820 --> 27:53.342
might get killed, bad things could happen to us, he 
said that if a man wasn't willing to die for

27:38.820 --> 27:53.342
something, that his life wasn't worth living. 
And, you know, you said, you know, you emphasized

27:53.643 --> 28:06.675
the point that if you didn't feel strong enough 
about a wrong or injustice or anything that you

27:53.643 --> 28:06.675
were fully committed to it, then you weren't much 
of a person. And it went on and on. You know, you

28:08.137 --> 28:13.502
heard speeches and you were ready to march. Yeah. 
Right. And that's how, really, I got involved. And

28:17.165 --> 28:22.350
you probably, did you ever hear of Congressman 
John Lewis? I wanted to read it live because I was

28:23.647 --> 28:31.475
going to ask you, I had a picture of him and what have 
you. John Lewis was like a couple of grades ahead of

28:31.535 --> 28:43.308
me in high school and he was one of the founders of 
SNCC, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating

28:31.535 --> 28:43.308
Committee. That's what you told me a little bit 
over the phone with. I talked with my history

28:47.292 --> 28:50.295
teacher a little bit about that. and uh but john 
lewis was one of the founders of it um and after

28:50.900 --> 29:12.672
talking with king and john lewis you know they kind 
of formed a network among you know the youngsters

28:50.900 --> 29:12.672
and college students and that's john lewis and my 
hearing that speech you know Right. Had me on my

29:14.396 --> 29:15.477
way. So did you start, did you do some stuff with 
SNCC, or did you? Yeah, we went around to a lot of

29:18.842 --> 29:24.250
college chapters and helped organize SNCC's 
chapters. We sat at some counters, lunch

29:26.513 --> 29:30.078
counters. Oh, y'all did? At the Woolworths, or 
just at the any? Yeah, at the Woolworths. You know,

29:35.326 --> 29:38.270
well, they would do a pick a target. And then, 
because a lot of times the local people, so much

29:38.291 --> 29:43.418
pressure could be put on them. Our side was, as they 
called us, troublemakers. We would go in and test

29:49.545 --> 29:51.047
them.

29:53.950 --> 29:58.434
There were no laws at the time, but to call 
attention to the problem. The Civil Rights Bill

29:59.034 --> 30:02.498
wasn't passed until the mid-60s. Johnson really 
got an accommodation bill, I think, prior to

30:03.339 --> 30:09.945
Johnson. Civil rights legislation didn't come 
until Johnson, until Johnson did. Well, did they

30:16.796 --> 30:18.318
have training sets? Yeah, they trained you how to 
ball up and how to protect your vital parts. They

30:24.385 --> 30:26.748
did that. So then when y'all went around and helped 
the other chapters, y'all did that? Told you how

30:30.133 --> 30:37.722
not to say things or do things that would inflame 
people, and they tested. your ability to be

30:38.225 --> 30:40.527
peaceful. To hold your tempers back? Yeah. They 
would berate you verbally and maybe assault you

30:48.495 --> 30:59.225
verbally. If you could, just sit there calmly and 
quietly and let them. The whole objective was not

31:03.910 --> 31:07.573
for you react, but to show the world how these 
people really were and put them in a bad light. And

31:17.269 --> 31:21.233
most of the time, you got obliged. Right. Well, 
when the TV, we talked about just about that time

31:23.056 --> 31:34.810
that, especially in Birmingham, when they 
started marching, that a lot of that started on TV,

31:23.056 --> 31:34.810
and that's when people became aware of that. Aware 
of what was really going on, right. so yeah you

31:37.118 --> 32:03.379
wanted to see that uh i remember that there was a 
public uh riding you know like the greyhound bus um

31:37.118 --> 32:03.379
of course the bus that i was on it didn't nothing but 
the buses john lewis and some of them were on that

31:37.118 --> 32:03.379
was the famous bus that was burned that was um he was 
on that bus when one of the free call them the

31:37.118 --> 32:03.379
freedom riders right But there were, you know, 
numerous things that, you know, numerous marches

32:05.435 --> 32:11.923
that Tuskegee itself. We went to Birmingham prior 
to the Great Birmingham March. Great Birmingham

32:20.573 --> 32:23.577
Rides, really, I guess you would call it. And we sat 
down a few places. But they didn't get, you know,

32:26.561 --> 32:33.349
the notoriety that we were put in jail, surrounded 
by the Ku Klux Klan and all this kind of thing. Did

32:34.527 --> 32:42.915
they have the, they didn't have, I just saw, I just, 
the one thing I remember from seeing that is like

32:34.527 --> 32:42.915
the fire hoses that they had out in, in that. Yeah. I 
wasn't in that, no. They didn't have that when you

32:44.897 --> 32:46.919
were before that? No, I demand they just burn you 
and beat you. You know, they take cigarettes and

32:50.463 --> 32:52.965
you see nothing. Gosh. And they can assault you 
verbally, kick you, beat you, and the police will

32:53.586 --> 32:59.411
be standing right there. And doing nothing, just 
standing there and looking?

33:06.590 --> 33:26.427
Um, did you feel like it was about, when did you feel 
like the people really started getting

33:06.590 --> 33:26.427
frustrated, like, from this, I mean, I know 
probably there was frustration all along, but

33:06.590 --> 33:26.427
when people started turning more towards, um, 
like, black power instead of just this not

33:06.590 --> 33:26.427
peaceful non-violence, or did you? I think 
basically, um, black power had its, uh, moments,

33:26.447 --> 33:35.955
but I don't think that black power ever really, uh, 
caught on in the black community. I know it was

33:39.073 --> 33:52.391
during this time that John Lewis and a lot of the 
original people in SNCC got out of it when Stokely

33:39.073 --> 33:52.391
Carmichael and Ralph Brown started doing this. 
Because it was a policy that really would only lead

33:52.851 --> 34:05.048
to genocide, the types of things they were 
actively seeking.

34:06.293 --> 34:18.048
You know, you didn't have the weaponry, you didn't 
have the numbers, you had nothing to wage any type

34:06.293 --> 34:18.048
of war of any time, of any length or duration, so 
there was a few left. Which is what they wanted to

34:18.208 --> 34:19.529
do. Yeah, yeah. Ultimately, they hollered the 
black power, and black power of itself to the

34:21.592 --> 34:36.250
thinking people, you know, people who had, you 
know, started this thing a long time before they

34:21.592 --> 34:36.250
came along with an empty holler, that's all. It 
meant nothing. It had nothing. It frightened

34:40.364 --> 34:41.546
people. And Dr. King and the original SNCC people, 
they wanted not to frighten whites, but to elicit

34:42.006 --> 34:55.463
the supports of whites who were right. And black 
power had the opposite effect of what the movement

34:55.864 --> 35:02.653
started out to be. So there were those blacks, or 
like whites, who think that violence and all of

35:07.516 --> 35:13.565
this can handle it. But in the end, it would have 
proved, if it had been an all-out black-white

35:13.585 --> 35:26.385
struggle, it would have ended in chaos and you 
wouldn't have won. So did you, like when you said

35:27.243 --> 35:40.525
John Lewis and all those started dropping out of 
SNCC, was that when they started, like a lot of the

35:27.243 --> 35:40.525
white little students from the north that were in 
there, when that's when they started ousting and

35:27.243 --> 35:40.525
that's when they, was that when they started 
leaving? Yeah, that's when they started leaving

35:40.545 --> 35:41.927
it. And I'll never forget, it started, the focus 
started going someplace else. And I guess the most

35:52.893 --> 36:07.652
graphic thing, I can remember being in 
Mississippi, and we were talking, trying to get

35:52.893 --> 36:07.652
people to support galvanized and everything. And 
there was this fringe of SNCC people who were

36:07.672 --> 36:13.639
honoring black power. And there was a man, an old 
man, laying on that farm, black farmer, who got up

36:14.841 --> 36:22.410
and said

36:25.360 --> 36:27.362
You can holler black power all you want. And he 
wasn't dressed nice. He had on all broken hands and

36:32.327 --> 36:35.090
two or three pair overalls. But he reached inside 
those overalls, and he had a roll of like $100

36:35.951 --> 36:40.976
bills. And he said, this is power. And this is where 
we need to go. And he said, if you have money in

36:45.420 --> 36:48.063
America, you got power. And I know for me, that was 
kind of a telling thing. The laws were fine and

36:55.280 --> 37:00.028
everything like that, but money really was the 
equalizer. So, so you never really moved in or

37:02.211 --> 37:06.558
became involved with that? Well, not with the 
Black Power thing too much, no. Um, mine was like in

37:11.967 --> 37:21.422
the early years, like, I only was only for a brief 
period, say like 59 through 61.

37:24.170 --> 37:26.393
when I was involved after that time. You know, I was 
sending money and what have you, but after getting

37:26.934 --> 37:41.212
kicked out of Tuskegee and coming to Texas and, you 
know, I... You came out, you didn't get your... No,

37:26.934 --> 37:41.212
I didn't graduate. I was a radical at the time, and 
you have to understand the situation. That

37:47.941 --> 37:52.287
Tuskegee Institute, unlike Texas A&M, even 
though they are both, had the military tradition.

37:54.542 --> 38:00.007
They both were fine agricultural and mechanical 
schools. Both Tuskegee had, at the time I

38:00.608 --> 38:08.676
attended, one of the top 10 veterinary schools in 
the nation.

38:12.080 --> 38:13.261
There was no integration. The state of Alabama 
subsidized Tuskegee. I'm saying this now. I

38:19.447 --> 38:21.970
didn't know why at the time. like I later found out. 
I knew it was something. I just thought they were on

38:25.075 --> 38:32.164
the tone at the time, the white president and dean 
and all those people. But I found out why they did

38:32.184 --> 38:34.387
what they did.

38:37.231 --> 38:45.561
The state supported Tuskegee's Veterinary 
Medicine School, the engineering school, and all

38:37.231 --> 38:45.561
of these things. Because they didn't want anybody 
to go to the University of Alabama. They didn't

38:48.850 --> 38:52.013
want blacks to go to the University of Alabama. 
Auburn, see, Auburn is about 30 miles from

38:52.133 --> 38:59.059
Tuskegee, over 30 miles. And they didn't, the 
legislators pressured these people and said,

38:59.079 --> 39:08.327
look, you know, you put out these radicals, you 
know, you're going to withdraw your funds. And I

39:09.428 --> 39:14.653
just feel that that was one of the reasons why a lot 
of us force to leave. Even though, you know, I was an

39:16.214 --> 39:17.755
honor student. Really? And everything, but 
because I was a part of that radical element, you

39:19.036 --> 39:24.802
know, I had to go. That threatened there. Yeah. I 
had to go. So did, um, so when you came here, then,

39:29.446 --> 39:36.152
um, is that when you became active in the NAACP 
here? I came to Waco. Okay. And I, uh, I was a black

39:39.054 --> 39:44.539
minister in my hometown who, uh, looked who had 
gone to school with the president, then

39:44.924 --> 39:51.030
president, of Paul Quinn College. And I haven't 
been in the South in a lot of those colleges. A lot of

39:55.614 --> 39:58.837
them, the state school and things, that's in 
Walrus.

40:01.560 --> 40:11.249
But he called them, and they accepted me, and 
transcript and everything. I went to Tuskegee. I

40:12.430 --> 40:14.492
mean, I finished with Paul Quinn College. I didn't

40:15.147 --> 40:20.434
know anybody in Texas either. I thought everybody 
in Texas was rich. I owned the oil wells. Really?

40:26.002 --> 40:26.603
Did the what? Owned the oil wells. Oh, yeah. You 
know, the only Texans I'd ever seen had the long

40:29.106 --> 40:43.045
boots and Continentals, Lincolns, Caddacks, big 
ass and horses and I just, I had this misconception

40:29.106 --> 40:43.045
of Texas. Most people feel that people in the South 
were dumb and backwards and poor and all those kind

40:43.413 --> 40:51.322
of things. But that's how I got to Texas. And after 
graduating from Paul Quinn, then I came to Bryant

40:52.844 --> 41:01.815
High School for 12 years, 12 and a half years. 
That's

41:01.835 --> 41:05.319
a lot. I'm going to turn this over real quick.
