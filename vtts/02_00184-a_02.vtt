WEBVTT

00:02.849 --> 00:08.317
I didn't, you know, because I thought, you know, by 
God, if you're going to do this, you've got to do it

00:02.849 --> 00:08.317
yourself. And it's a sign of weakness and 
inability if you go so silly. So, in fact, that was

00:14.546 --> 00:20.855
an issue when my junior year came around and I 
needed teacher recommendations and I didn't know

00:14.546 --> 00:20.855
who I would go ask. As far as you and your friends 
were aware, were there any

00:21.916 --> 00:29.447
easy courses, giveaway grades,

00:33.157 --> 00:35.360
Cowboy chemistry was a giveaway grade. That was 
for ag majors? Yeah, yeah.

00:42.389 --> 00:43.410
But not really. Were there any that you heard of 
where the athletes got freebies? Yeah, but not

00:47.315 --> 00:51.060
freebies, but just the ones that they all took. 
There was a, what was it, the marriage and family

00:51.100 --> 00:55.165
class. Dr. Dan, the grade player. Yeah. Dan 
Russell. And I heard that the football players all

00:59.070 --> 01:02.134
took that one. But everybody wanted to take that 
one because, you know, they saw, you know, Grody

01:02.688 --> 01:14.344
films and, you know, did stuff that everybody 
wanted to talk about that our society still wasn't

01:02.688 --> 01:14.344
too clear it wanted to have out in the open. I never 
took it. One of my buddies did. It was an education

01:16.868 --> 01:18.150
major. Who were some of the celebrity students 
that were here, the students that were high

01:18.490 --> 01:26.301
profile? Fred McClure. Did you meet Fred? We were 
very dear friends. We worked in student

01:31.689 --> 01:33.211
government together. Make believe I'd never met 
him. Okay. Describe it. It was, and I don't even

01:36.093 --> 01:48.424
remember Fred much from my freshman year, but Fred 
was elected speaker of the student senate my

01:36.093 --> 01:48.424
sophomore year, and I was recording secretary. 
I'd gone from being an executive aide to being

01:48.464 --> 01:59.053
recording secretary my sophomore year, so we ran 
the student senate meetings every couple of

01:48.464 --> 01:59.053
weeks, and so that's how Fred, and Fred And I 
remember just being incredibly impressed that

01:59.033 --> 02:06.765
here was a black man who had been president of the 
National FFA. And that just blew me away right

02:07.286 --> 02:08.828
there. I thought, this guy has got to be 
incredible. To be, you know, in the mid-70s, you

02:11.172 --> 02:24.433
know, a black president of what was perceived then 
to be a pretty redneck organization, right? I

02:24.650 --> 02:27.294
thought, man, this guy's got to be incredible, and 
sure enough, he was. He was so full of life, so much

02:28.856 --> 02:32.661
fun, so bright. He still... And I have been 
doing... I'm speaker myself and have been doing

02:36.146 --> 02:48.242
stuff in the AMA and the TMA, parliamentary stuff 
for years, and I have never seen anybody with a

02:36.146 --> 02:48.242
mastery of parliamentary procedure like Fred 
McClure did when he was a junior in college. It just

02:48.622 --> 02:49.403
blew me away. We had so much fun. And... Fred 
McClure was larger than life. Tony Franklin was

02:56.467 --> 02:58.509
larger than life. Everybody knew who Tony 
Franklin was. And I remember running into him one

03:00.952 --> 03:12.164
time, and my asthma had flared up, and I was getting 
checked out in the student center, and Tony

03:00.952 --> 03:12.164
Franklin evidently just owned the place. He could 
just go anywhere he wanted to, and Tony Franklin

03:12.184 --> 03:16.930
walks in the room while the doctor's checking me 
out. Unfortunately, I was dressed, but I just

03:17.470 --> 03:23.817
remember thinking, oh, my God, you know, here's 
this football hero standing right here, and

03:17.470 --> 03:23.817
everybody knew him, and But the football players 
were Lester Hayes and Pat Thomas and all those guys

03:24.370 --> 03:33.417
were heroes. Where's their? Was there yet a highly 
visible, prominent co-ed student? Yes, Kim

03:40.453 --> 03:44.578
Tomes, who won Miss USA. That's T-O-M-E-S. Yes, 
yes, Kim Tomes won Miss USA, and she lived in Kruger

03:45.960 --> 03:56.453
with us, and I'll never forget, because, you know, 
we talked about the dorm dress code. Well, Kim

03:56.433 --> 04:03.321
would go down to eat breakfast in a T-shirt and 
jeans and no makeup and just like anybody else. But

04:03.481 --> 04:08.727
when she went into pageant mode, oh, my goodness, 
just a total knockout. And so much fun and so down to

04:09.568 --> 04:12.571
earth. She was a blast. And we were all so proud 
because we really, the women on campus, Really,

04:20.429 --> 04:26.875
her winning Miss USA and being an Aggie was 
incredibly inspirational to us. It made us feel

04:27.335 --> 04:30.818
really good about having arrived. And the jokes 
about women at A&M being less than gorgeous or

04:32.099 --> 04:43.209
whatever. And so that was, yeah, Kim was probably 
the highest profile female that I remember. MSC,

04:50.703 --> 04:57.153
what role did the MSC play then in student? It was 
very big. Of course, they didn't have near the

04:58.776 --> 05:07.289
number of organizations that they did now, but at 
least it seemed very big to me because I was active

04:58.776 --> 05:07.289
in organizations on campus. So that's where, you 
know, the kids that were interested and active,

05:07.329 --> 05:13.960
whether you were in the Corps or not, male or 
female, they were involved in MSC activities.

05:17.350 --> 05:33.874
They were in student government, they were in 
SCONA, they were on OPUS, they were in Town Hall,

05:17.350 --> 05:33.874
they were, those were the kids that were, enjoyed 
other people, wanted to be involved, wanted to do

05:17.350 --> 05:33.874
something, wanted to be a part of something. It was 
very, very important. Did you meet Wayne Stark?

05:39.425 --> 05:39.646
Yes. Just make believe I didn't know him. Describe 
him. Wayne, Mr. Stark, was, I was very intimidated

05:42.972 --> 05:58.999
by him at first because he was obviously the 
kingpin of the MSC, really ran a fairly tight ship.

05:59.570 --> 06:04.695
You know, you could tell which kids he favored and 
which kids really didn't know him very well. And

06:05.596 --> 06:29.239
what I did not realize until I really got to know him 
later on, probably my junior year, I guess, was

06:05.596 --> 06:29.239
how, what a mother hen he really was and how he loved 
those students and what incredible pride he took

06:05.596 --> 06:29.239
in their achievements after they left A&M. And 
because when Wayne Stark became your advocate, it

06:29.877 --> 06:41.158
was like you had General Patton out there fighting 
for you. He was just amazing. And it was so fun to

06:42.361 --> 06:51.598
visit with him in later years, either while I was in 
medical school or whatever, brag about him. kids

06:51.967 --> 06:56.493
that had done this and that, kids that you didn't 
even realize he had known. And so that was having

06:57.895 --> 07:02.320
his presence. Some students, the people that work 
with the students closely in student

07:04.143 --> 07:17.379
organization type stuff, sometimes there's kind 
of a buddy mentality or there's a grandfather

07:04.143 --> 07:17.379
mentality. And he was definitely the grandfather 
type. And And he was just delightful. Did you ever

07:23.867 --> 07:27.157
hear anybody talk about getting the green couch 
treatment from him? Vaguely, but I don't

07:27.839 --> 07:29.384
remember. He had this old, old crotchety looking 
green formaldehyde-covered couch, and if he felt

07:33.361 --> 07:46.441
that you were goofing off and not living up to your 
potential, he would maneuver you, close the door,

07:33.361 --> 07:46.441
and there was a lecture that you never forgot. It 
was called the green couch treatment. It had

07:48.985 --> 07:51.088
nothing to do with sex. No, no. It was to... Oh, 
that's funny. Let's see. Was Chad Edwards around?

07:57.289 --> 07:57.490
Yes. Well, no. He had just graduated. Had he? Okay. 
Every once in a while, he would come to the student

07:59.593 --> 08:04.259
government office, and I'd see him there, but I 
really didn't. I just knew who he was, and I knew

08:04.319 --> 08:08.004
that all the girls in the student government 
adored him. And he was quite a presence even then.

08:12.871 --> 08:14.714
Of course, he was handsome. He was charismatic. He 
was bright. He obviously had an incredible future

08:16.236 --> 08:19.120
ahead. And like... a number of successful 
politicians just have this charisma about them

08:22.045 --> 08:27.873
that draws you to them. Let's see. And so the MSC was 
a valuable, valuable... Oh, yes. Incredible.

08:40.670 --> 08:43.113
Was the Rudder Center finished? Oh, yeah. Yeah, it 
was finished. Do you remember any important

08:45.396 --> 08:47.479
events there?

08:51.155 --> 08:55.381
see or hear any great concerts or speakers that 
were?

08:58.445 --> 09:01.009
I remember Vladimir Horowitz played. Okay. That 
was pretty amazing. The first formal concert was

09:04.754 --> 09:09.280
Van Cliburn. Oh my gosh. That was the first. I just 
remember just what a gorgeous facility it was and

09:12.485 --> 09:20.997
how impressed I was with the elegance. With your 
profession now, did you go to the Quack Shack when

09:21.498 --> 09:25.824
you were a student? Mm-hmm. Describe it. Oh, well. 
I... It did not have the best reputation, as many

09:34.760 --> 09:48.938
student health centers don't, but I wasn't afraid 
to go over there because I still had, my asthma

09:34.760 --> 09:48.938
still kicked up occasionally and I tended to get 
sick a lot and for some reason, Most children get

09:49.205 --> 09:51.570
tonsillitis when they're three or four years old. 
I didn't start having tonsillitis until I was in

09:51.610 --> 09:53.854
college. And for a while, they got it about once a 
month. So I seemed to be over there a lot. But I just

09:58.342 --> 09:59.244
remember... But the physicians that I talked to 
seemed to be... They were okay. Do you remember any

10:06.645 --> 10:07.887
of them by name? Well, who was the head? Gos... 
Yeah. Goswin? Goswick? Something like that.

10:14.576 --> 10:18.642
Yeah, and then later did some work with the medical 
school, and I just thought he was delightful.

10:20.906 --> 10:29.038
There was one guy there that I, you know, I had a 
female problem, and he misprescribed it and gave

10:20.906 --> 10:29.038
me the wrong medicines, and I was just like, oh, 
great. But I'll never forget one time, I guess I was

10:29.679 --> 10:32.543
a junior, and was having a female problem and went 
over there. And it was just kind of a, everybody

10:35.856 --> 10:41.025
just kind of sat in the lobby together when you were 
waiting. And I remember the roommate of the man I

10:41.045 --> 10:51.342
eventually married came over and sat down and was 
like, well, what brings you here to the quack

10:41.045 --> 10:51.342
shack? I have a cold. Yeah, I have a cold. And now I'm 
so glad that women's health services have their

10:55.566 --> 11:04.236
own place so that women don't have to be subjected 
to that kind of embarrassment anymore. That was

11:04.256 --> 11:05.497
mortifying. So you met a special person here? In 
medical school. In medical school. Yeah, we

11:10.343 --> 11:12.565
didn't know each other's undergraduates. We'll 
get there eventually. What about dates when you

11:14.227 --> 11:18.952
were a freshman and sophomore? I dated some. Dated 
some guys in the Corps. Never thought that that

11:22.996 --> 11:42.522
would happen, because I always kind of considered 
myself fairly liberal-minded, but they were the

11:22.996 --> 11:42.522
guys that knew what was going on, they were fun, 
they had a bunch of buddies, and never missed

11:22.996 --> 11:42.522
anything. They were a lot of fun to be around. Did 
they still have the big dances? Boot dance? Yeah, I

11:49.367 --> 11:51.991
had boot dance, ring dance, yeah. What was the 
routine for a young lady at one of those? Oh, gosh,

11:55.396 --> 11:57.840
you sat around and hoped somebody would ask you. 
And I remember when one of the seniors did ask me to

11:59.002 --> 12:04.169
boot dance when I was a junior. Oh, my gosh, I just 
thought that I'd, you know. How were you all

12:07.514 --> 12:09.237
treated at the dance? Like royalty, like 
princesses. That's what everybody has said. Yes.

12:13.971 --> 12:14.933
Everybody has said. We were like princesses. It 
was incredible. When, on a big, let's see, they

12:18.379 --> 12:23.749
picked you up at the dorm. Did you all wear formals? 
Yes. Yes, we wore long dresses. We had corsages. It

12:30.603 --> 12:32.406
was a very...

12:34.242 --> 12:58.258
Well, it was really a very formal process, and the 
different meaning of the word formal, that they

12:34.242 --> 12:58.258
would, you know, be called upstairs, or if they 
were visiting hours, they would actually come to

12:34.242 --> 12:58.258
your room, but more often than not, we'd meet them 
downstairs in the commons and, you know, get your

12:34.242 --> 12:58.258
flower pinned on, and somebody might take a 
picture, and they'd escort you over to the dance,

12:34.242 --> 12:58.258
and it was a very... And y'all didn't have dance 
cards. No, no, no. And what orchestras? Because it

13:08.195 --> 13:09.618
was a live band, wasn't it? Usually. Sometimes, I 
don't remember. I don't remember what bands would

13:15.628 --> 13:17.091
play. See, among the things I wish we could 
resurrect is the Aggieland Orchestra, which did

13:17.442 --> 13:25.543
big band music in the 30s and 40s. They were so 
successful, they went out of town on buses and made

13:26.024 --> 13:30.897
a profit. Wow. the Houston, Dallas, Waco, Austin, 
and they had the, it was Glenn Miller-style music.

13:38.363 --> 13:39.244
Yeah, that'd be wonderful. We need to have 
somebody at least play at graduation. This canned

13:41.308 --> 13:43.932
music at graduation thing has got to stop. I'm with 
you. Oh, man. Back to the dorms. You all had no male

13:50.175 --> 13:56.672
visiting in girls' dorm rooms. There was. What 
were the rules? The rules? Well, guys could come in

13:59.720 --> 14:04.392
the dorms just during certain hours. at not during 
the day on the weekdays as I recall for a few hours in

14:04.709 --> 14:30.936
the evening it was okay and on weekends they could 
come during the day but you know pretty much had to

14:04.709 --> 14:30.936
be out of there by midnight or or something like 
that it was pretty strictly enforced did was there

14:04.709 --> 14:30.936
much partying in the dorms oh yeah oh yeah describe 
what oh it's you know people would get together in

14:04.709 --> 14:30.936
somebody's dorm rooms whether it was either just 
girls or girls and guys and And there'd be beer,

14:31.372 --> 14:42.246
which was legal then, and music and people 
hollering, and they just had a great time. And what

14:42.826 --> 14:45.370
did you all do if the noise was too much? What was the 
system for getting them to tone it down? I don't

14:49.715 --> 14:52.278
remember there ever being an issue. I don't think 
anybody cared. Oh, okay, okay. If you really

14:55.250 --> 15:00.157
needed to study that night, and they're making 
noise, where did you go? You went down to the study

15:00.197 --> 15:01.980
carrels. They were very well insulated and quiet. 
If the study carrel that you were at was too close to

15:05.405 --> 15:09.571
the noise, you could go find another one. There 
were plenty of them. What was the difference

15:12.155 --> 15:14.558
between Kruger and Dunn, if any? Oh, it was done, 
you know, being the male dorm, it was just a little,

15:15.449 --> 15:26.972
yeah, it was just a little, it was a little crazier, 
but there wasn't much difference between Kruger

15:15.449 --> 15:26.972
and Mosier, really, when Mosier came online. Were 
there also some women's dorms north campus? Yes,

15:31.320 --> 15:34.386
yeah, Keith Lee Fowler Hughes. But this was, y'all 
thought better. Oh yes, we were cool. They were

15:38.592 --> 15:39.834
just the ordinary people. What about the food? The 
food in the Commons was great. I think the freshman

15:44.382 --> 15:48.048
15 was probably the freshman 20 or 25 for a lot of us. 
Because I remember I was very impressed with, of

15:48.689 --> 15:57.825
course you get tired of it after a while, but the 
quality, the quantity of the food that was served,

15:48.689 --> 15:57.825
the the baked goods were good. Again, I couldn't 
believe we had steak night every once in a while and

16:00.728 --> 16:04.712
we'd get big old T-bones. So the food was good. 
Alright, let's go back. Did Mom and Dad give you any

16:10.638 --> 16:15.103
advice as you were entering college? Things to do 
or not to do?

16:21.870 --> 16:27.255
Not really because, you know, I knew that there was 
a standard. I knew that I was expected to do my best.

16:33.918 --> 16:36.101
I knew that I was expected to not get into trouble. I 
knew that I was supposed to be a good girl, and

16:36.862 --> 16:42.590
that's just kind of all there was to it. I mean, 
there wasn't a sitting down, coming to Jesus

16:42.650 --> 16:48.518
meeting about any of that. And really, about the 
only advice This wasn't advice. Tell me what to do.

16:58.450 --> 17:04.023
Probably sometime, I think it was during my 
freshman year, there was a place called the

16:58.450 --> 17:04.023
Mansard House. And there were some guys in the 
corps that were getting up a little band. And they

17:11.802 --> 17:13.904
wanted me to be their accompanist. And I'd make 
some money, and they wanted me to go play out there.

17:17.068 --> 17:18.850
And Mother was like, not only no, but hell no. You 
know, you don't need to be doing that. You need to be

17:21.252 --> 17:23.114
studying and doing that kind of stuff. And that was 
not a debatable? No, it was not debatable. Once she

17:25.797 --> 17:27.339
gave you that answer. Yeah, that was not 
debatable, and I was really mad. But she was right.

17:32.565 --> 17:34.387
What kind of spending money did you have? Did you 
have an allowance or not? I don't even remember.

17:36.949 --> 17:37.991
I've been trying to think that. I think I got a 
monthly allowance, and that was... That was

17:41.418 --> 17:43.560
pretty much it, but I don't remember how much it 
was. Not very much, I'm sure. And you had a

17:45.642 --> 17:47.163
telephone in your room. Yes. And you made phone 
calls occasionally home. Any other phone calls

17:51.887 --> 17:54.710
much? Every once in a while I'd talk to my sister at 
TCU or talk to friends at other schools. Is this an

18:04.438 --> 18:05.519
older sister? Yes. Did you ask her for advice ever? 
No. No. And when you and, did a group of girls ever go

18:11.793 --> 18:20.509
out on a Friday or Saturday? Oh, yeah. Where would 
y'all go? We would go, we didn't go to the Chicken

18:21.791 --> 18:25.137
much. A lot of people went to the Chicken. I didn't 
go there very much. It was always so crowded and so

18:28.383 --> 18:30.688
rowdy. But the deal was then Thursday nights go to 
Lakeview. And so that was the big deal because the

18:35.266 --> 18:44.382
beer was 35 cents on Thursday nights and Dennis 
Ivey and the Wayman would play and there were the

18:45.003 --> 18:46.465
place was packed. And so that's where people went 
on Thursday nights. We'd either get a group of

18:49.989 --> 18:52.992
girls going, a group of girls and guys going 
together. Sometimes people would have dates, but

18:53.332 --> 18:56.236
it was just, that's where everybody went. And I'll 
never, and I think my first time at Lakeview made as

18:56.296 --> 19:03.504
much of an impression on me as my first Aggie 
football game. Because I had really never been

19:03.524 --> 19:07.448
around country western dancing, you know, 
growing up in the middle of Houston. And And I will

19:08.830 --> 19:17.028
never forget standing in that dance hall and 
seeing these people, you know, dance country

19:08.830 --> 19:17.028
western in this big circle around. I was just 
absolutely floored. Of course, it wasn't too long

19:19.052 --> 19:22.199
before I was out there with them and just loved it. 
We had so much fun. So what would y'all wear to

19:24.507 --> 19:26.249
Lakeview? We would wear jeans and boots, but would 
kind of dress up. We wanted to look nice. But we

19:33.137 --> 19:35.660
would dance until we were just raining wet. We 
danced and we danced and we danced and we danced.

19:37.903 --> 19:40.025
That was okay for a young lady to drink beer? Yes. 
What about something stronger?

19:44.771 --> 19:48.115
That was okay too, but it was awfully expensive. 
What were students drinking then? Oh, silly

19:51.963 --> 20:08.827
things like Tom Collins' and rum, you know, 
bourbon and coke and sweet liquor concoctions,

19:51.963 --> 20:08.827
you know, sometimes kind of a, you know, a garbage 
can, you know, punch type thing with, you know,

19:51.963 --> 20:08.827
Everclear and all that, you know, crazy stuff that 
college kids do. But it was a, nobody drank wine.

20:12.332 --> 20:13.193
Nobody drank wine. They drank beer or a sweet mixed 
drink. And what were the popular beers? Oh, Pearl,

20:19.283 --> 20:23.270
Schlitz, Lone Star. There was no Miller Lite. We 
didn't have Coors in Texas yet then, so that was a

20:26.295 --> 20:32.926
real delicacy if somebody brought some down from 
Colorado. Did you or any of your friends ever go to

20:33.267 --> 20:36.472
Whiskey Bridge? No. But you all knew where it was? 
No, I don't even remember that. You don't? No. Oh,

20:42.385 --> 20:50.273
straight across, going to Snook, straight across 
the river on the right was a little of what would

20:42.385 --> 20:50.273
have been a convenience store country. And that, 
in the olden days, was the nearest place to buy

20:50.894 --> 20:56.039
whiskey or to buy anything other than beer. Okay. 
Because this was a dry county. I do not remember

20:57.641 --> 20:58.462
that. Well, they tore the building down about a 
year ago as they widened Farm Road 60. But that was

21:04.528 --> 21:06.590
the place you went. Then one, before you're in my 
memory, because i got here in 59 there was a place

21:09.841 --> 21:39.460
down about where the copy bridge hamburger place 
is below 20 on the welborn road there was a place

21:09.841 --> 21:39.460
called uncle ed's and his h-y-r-d-l-y-c-k-a 
herdlicka check but it was hard lickers and you

21:09.841 --> 21:39.460
walk down there to drink a lot of beer now you've got 
an 11 o'clock 11 o'clock okay all right so we'll go

21:09.841 --> 21:39.460
and it's here so we're but but where You say here, 
where? In the library? Yeah, it's in the library

21:42.935 --> 21:45.078
someplace, so we don't have to go far. Let's see. As 
a sophomore, was it any different to go to a

21:47.801 --> 21:54.590
football game or a basketball game for you? It was 
different just because I was more likely to have a

21:54.870 --> 21:56.913
date. I felt more comfortable there. I felt not as 
intimidated by... I knew the traditions. I felt

22:03.741 --> 22:06.104
comfortable with the routine. I... All right, 
let's make believe it's a day game, home game,

22:07.942 --> 22:11.387
afternoon. The date would come pick you up when? If 
it was somebody in the Corps, he would come get you

22:15.372 --> 22:19.257
before march in. So it was a couple hours before the 
game. All right, and then did you go with him to

22:21.620 --> 22:25.005
where? Well, would follow him as far as we could. 
Probably don't go over the quad, you know, where

22:28.790 --> 22:34.017
they lined up. And then they would march in the 
stadium, and then the girls in their heels and hose

22:34.368 --> 22:42.680
and dresses and mums would walk. We'd all go to the 
stadium and meet them in the stadium once they got

22:43.401 --> 22:46.505
done with marching. Now, how would you all 
establish exactly where in the stadium you were

22:46.785 --> 22:51.492
going to be while he? We just had our tickets and met 
at the seats. Okay. Yeah, just met at the seats. All

22:55.878 --> 22:57.140
right. And there was a mum? Usually, yeah, 
usually, yeah, yeah. And during the game, what

23:01.402 --> 23:06.670
kind of shenanigans went on in the stands? Oh, 
people just hollered and screamed and had fun. But

23:09.854 --> 23:18.807
not a lot of shenanigans went on in the stands 
because we watched those yell-eaters and, you

23:09.854 --> 23:18.807
know, you obeyed those hand signals. And it was 
very much a single-celled organism. I mean, just

23:24.997 --> 23:28.742
the student body just acted as one, as a unit. Now, 
in the olden days, it was considered cool for

23:28.722 --> 23:34.547
particular sophomore boys to smoke cigars. Was 
that, in your day, was that a... I think there was

23:36.969 --> 23:38.690
some of that going on. I don't remember that much. 
Some. I remember that more at parties than I do at

23:40.652 --> 23:42.393
the games. Did anybody get drunk during the game? 
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. And what happened to them?

23:48.759 --> 23:54.183
Um... Would sometimes somebody help kind of get 
them out of the stadium? Yeah, but I don't remember

23:54.203 --> 23:56.365
that happening too much. I really don't. Um... 
Because everybody knew there was going to be a big

23:59.198 --> 24:01.140
party later. What did a young lady do if the Aggie 
scored a lot of touchdowns and she had a date with a

24:02.682 --> 24:08.528
guy that she really didn't enjoy much? Well, 
that's just too bad. You kissed him anyway.

24:16.356 --> 24:22.203
Or if it was 66 to nothing, perhaps you excused 
yourself to the restroom and stayed gone as long as

24:16.356 --> 24:22.203
you could. But then he might want to catch up on you 
when you got back. Did you go to many out-of-town

24:27.468 --> 24:29.070
games? I went to a few. I remember coming to the SMU 
game once for a court trip. I remember going, yeah,

24:32.740 --> 24:42.933
I remember coming back to Houston, I think maybe 
playing Cougar High in Rice Stadium. So I went to

24:44.054 --> 24:53.185
some of the, never went to Waco, but went to some, 
never got to go to LSU, never got to do that, because

24:44.054 --> 24:53.185
of course, that's a mosquito. The guys, everybody 
wanted to go to the LSU game and party on Bourbon

24:53.890 --> 25:00.262
Street, but I never got to do that. Did you go to 
Austin ever? Yeah, yeah, went to, I actually

25:03.027 --> 25:07.535
didn't go to the game. I don't think we had tickets. 
Were there any games that were particularly

25:11.782 --> 25:15.409
memorable for you? Oh, that either my freshman or 
sophomore year was the first time that we had beat

25:15.608 --> 25:24.184
Texas in a long, like 20 to 10, long, long time. And I 
just remember, Ed Simonini played that game, and I

25:24.586 --> 25:38.590
just remember sitting in the stadium after the 
game, just kind of wondrous, because I realized

25:24.586 --> 25:38.590
what a big deal that was. And looking at the 
scoreboard, and that was, that probably made more

25:38.650 --> 25:46.343
of an impression on me than anything. What did you 
and your friends think about Y'all Eaters? Oh,

25:49.208 --> 25:49.969
they were cool. They were it. They were the most 
popular guys on campus. And if you had a date with a

25:54.883 --> 25:59.028
yell leader, you were just hot stuff, and that's 
all there was to it. Now, if you had a date with a yell

25:59.148 --> 26:02.213
leader, you sat down then on the first row? Mm-hmm. 
Mm-hmm. Okay. And they, after a touchdown, did

26:04.376 --> 26:08.441
they run over and kiss the head? Yes. Yes. Okay. And 
was there any thought, did you ever hear of any

26:11.585 --> 26:20.658
female even dare think about running for yell 
leader? No. No. Were there, were all the Yell

26:21.370 --> 26:24.053
leaders in the Corps then? Yes, but there was a, 
Frank Shannon got elected and he was, I don't know

26:24.073 --> 26:39.169
if he was the first non-reg Yell leader, but I 
remember he was a non-reg and that was a big deal

26:24.073 --> 26:39.169
when he got, when he got elected. What about 
basketball games? Basketball games were fun. I

26:44.234 --> 26:45.595
didn't go to a whole lot of them. I just wasn't a big 
basketball fan and

26:51.070 --> 27:05.004
But one of the gals that I ran around with had a crush 
on one of the basketball players, so she dragged us

26:51.070 --> 27:05.004
along because she didn't want to miss the games and 
didn't want to go by herself because this guy had no

26:51.070 --> 27:05.004
idea who she was. But they were fun. G. Raleigh was 
those old wooden seats. We packed it. Nobody goes

27:14.474 --> 27:15.475
now. Isn't that something? Reed is empty, empty, 
empty. And they play this silly, goofy, wild music

27:19.611 --> 27:25.382
that has nothing to do with A&M's traditions. You 
know, it's fun because baseball now has its own new

27:25.823 --> 27:32.596
set of traditions and things that they do at games 
that are really a lot of fun. Yes, yes. And we need to

27:33.738 --> 27:36.163
get that for basketball. And you didn't go to 
baseball or track or anything. Let's see, do you

27:40.873 --> 27:46.780
remember any concerts or plays, opus? Oh, I 
remember a lot of the concerts, town hall concerts

27:47.441 --> 27:51.967
before football games. Seemed like there was 
always a big concert the Friday night before a

27:52.007 --> 27:56.272
football game. I remember the Ohio players. I 
remember Linda Ronstadt. That was a big deal when

28:00.497 --> 28:04.362
Linda Ronstadt came to campus. Hamilton, Joe 
Franken, Reynolds, some of the country acts. But

28:07.348 --> 28:10.934
these were all just pop groups that were popular at 
the time that nobody else has ever heard of. But I

28:10.974 --> 28:20.051
remember just thinking, how did they get these 
people to come to College Station, Texas?

28:20.191 --> 28:22.075
Did y'all have any hijinks in the dorm? Any pranks, 
jokes? Oh, yeah. None that I really cared to

28:27.134 --> 28:28.678
discuss. You know, making crank phone calls to 
guys that you had a crush on. I remember one night

28:36.519 --> 28:42.094
when somebody brought a bunch of cigars and we were 
all up there smoking cigars. Oh, God, nasty. Oh,

28:44.436 --> 28:45.978
we've all felt so bad the next day. Occasionally 
there were panty raids, but our windows didn't

28:47.701 --> 28:55.394
really open, so that was kind of not much of an 
issue. But every once in a while some of the guys

28:55.694 --> 29:02.165
from Dunn or Ashton would come over and do 
something crazy. And there was no streaking

29:02.646 --> 29:05.871
during your era, was there? but I think there were a 
couple of streaking events like that my first or

29:06.678 --> 29:11.825
second year on campus. I don't remember much about 
them, but. What I remember.

29:20.677 --> 29:25.403
What described the Texas A&M's undergraduate 
student body when you were here? Where were they

29:25.984 --> 29:26.885
from? Who were they? What were their basic 
attitudes, goals? It was

29:35.753 --> 29:48.024
Well, it was interesting because when I started, 
fall of 74, my freshman class was the first class

29:35.753 --> 29:48.024
that had an approximately equal number of women 
and men. So among the freshmen, it looked like what

29:48.985 --> 29:58.394
I would imagine that pretty much any other college 
campus in Texas looked like at the time. You know,

30:00.256 --> 30:02.638
kids in polyester and bell bottoms and, long hair 
and, you know, blue eyeshadow, but that kind of

30:03.209 --> 30:09.157
describes the college campus now, actually. But 
the upperclassmen were very much more male and

30:10.378 --> 30:16.426
rural. And so it was kind of interesting how there 
was a real dichotomy between the upperclassmen

30:17.147 --> 30:24.837
and the underclassmen. Now, did Krugerdown open 
that fall? No, I think it had been open for a year,

30:28.422 --> 30:31.866
maybe two. And so there were, you know, there were a 
lot of young women on campus and a lot of young women

30:32.403 --> 30:41.277
and older men. Were you all conscious at that time 
of this being a? Oh, yes. Oh, yeah. It was very, very

30:47.287 --> 30:48.469
obvious. Were you proud to be a part of the 
transition? Yeah. Yeah, I really was. Really was.

30:53.357 --> 30:57.043
Because we knew that we were the wave of a 
revolution. And in family income, generalize

30:57.479 --> 31:02.410
about the background of the students. That was 
different, too. I think the younger classmen were

31:03.613 --> 31:13.716
more likely to be from upper middle class families 
in large cities.
