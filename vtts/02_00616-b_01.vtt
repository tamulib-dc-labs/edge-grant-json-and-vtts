00:05.600 --> 00:12.908
So I wanted to write a textbook on biological 
oceanography, which was to comprise production

00:05.600 --> 00:12.908
biology without fisheries. Fisheries is so large 
a subject, and there is so much known about that.

00:17.493 --> 00:27.423
And the production biology of the plankton and of 
the benthos, and touch upon biogeography, which,

00:17.493 --> 00:27.423
as I mentioned earlier, is a very important part of 
biological oceanography. But at Scripps, then, I

00:28.885 --> 00:33.970
very early saw that, for practical reasons, To 
finish half of it before it's getting outdated, I

00:34.979 --> 00:49.977
would have to split it into two volumes, and so I 
split Bentos and Biogic, or Geography, off, and

00:34.979 --> 00:49.977
then, when leaving Scripps, thought of a book on 
Plankton.

00:52.641 --> 00:57.747
But, and I write the other book later, but now after 
hiring Jumas, I realize now how little I know in

00:58.132 --> 01:25.995
benthos that I'm just completely outdated and so I 
will not attempt benthos so that I'm left with the

00:58.132 --> 01:25.995
plankton which is alright but again for practical 
reasons the field has grown so much that I think I

00:58.132 --> 01:25.995
will restrict myself now to a phytoplankton book 
something like patterns of phytoplankton

00:58.132 --> 01:25.995
distribution in space and time in the ocean or 
something like that and then perhaps tackle the

01:26.735 --> 01:29.541
Zohar Plankton later. And it ought to be written at 
the next sabbatical eve, because now I know how to

01:30.783 --> 01:35.734
do it. What not to do, I have made all the mistakes. 
So let's hope for the best. There is no book yet, so

01:40.584 --> 01:45.975
it is still worthwhile doing it.

01:49.297 --> 02:00.189
The writing and the necessity to read now very 
broadly again brought back my interest in methods

01:49.297 --> 02:00.189
in plankton research. In effect, I wanted to pick 
up numbers, good examples to illustrate my

02:00.229 --> 02:13.144
points, and when thinking about these numbers, 
which I'd used in class for umpteen years, when

02:00.229 --> 02:13.144
thinking about it now, writing it down, I suddenly 
saw it can't be this way. And it turned out very

02:14.018 --> 02:21.845
often, no, because there were basic mistakes made 
of data collection or data interpretation. I've

02:21.925 --> 02:34.316
since then written quite a few papers, which have 
made quite a few colleagues angry, perhaps,

02:21.925 --> 02:34.316
saying that this is wrong and that was done 
incorrectly. So in other words, I'm back to

02:34.757 --> 02:44.025
plankton methods, not so much to say how to put the 
hydrochloric acid into the vial, but rather

02:44.005 --> 03:11.937
saying now suppose you want to find out such and 
such you can't use this route you have to use that

02:44.005 --> 03:11.937
approach or suppose you have this data you can't 
interpret as people have done for 20 years in this

02:44.005 --> 03:11.937
way no you have to think of this and that this kind of 
method I'm interested in which in other words to

02:44.005 --> 03:11.937
try to keep them honest really which still means no 
shipboard work The polykit work I had already

03:13.368 --> 03:19.697
alluded to is not really appropriate in an 
oceanography department. I can't train

03:19.737 --> 03:29.451
students, so half of my research work is done in a 
field where the students can't emulate me and

03:19.737 --> 03:29.451
where I can't get money for research support 
either.

03:32.736 --> 03:42.210
My continued interest in really evaluating data 
which exists already, be it textbook writing or

03:32.736 --> 03:42.210
worrying about methods, means not collecting new 
data, that means not going out to sea, nor standing

03:42.983 --> 03:47.842
in the lab. So the students really don't see me 
work. And I think this is not very good. I don't give

03:52.881 --> 03:54.327
them the example. which is too bad, that it's just 
the way it is, but I do want to mention that part of

03:55.471 --> 04:03.543
the academic teacher is to give an example. And if 
the academic teacher is very nervous and always

04:04.083 --> 04:12.315
has his door shut and works on data, the students 
always wonder, well, shall we disturb him, shall

04:04.083 --> 04:12.315
we not disturb him? That is not a good example. 
Whereas Duckdale, for example, is always out at

04:14.599 --> 04:24.533
sea, he meets his group every day over the coffee 
pot, so there's a very different way of teaching,

04:14.599 --> 04:24.533
and that shows in his students. But it's too bad. I 
just had to finish these polygates, and as I said,

04:26.054 --> 04:33.989
there is no textbook, so somebody has to sit down. 
And then, of course, the newcomer, who has just

04:34.610 --> 04:42.665
lectured twice about Balashur, thinks now he 
knows everything, ought not to write a textbook.

04:43.627 --> 04:46.993
As I mentioned earlier, I put my notes from the 
early days in a textbook form but good that I didn't

04:47.362 --> 04:54.819
start writing because obviously it couldn't have 
had much depth.

05:03.198 --> 05:06.265
If I now were to start active work again, then I 
think it will be in plant production, in animal

05:06.835 --> 05:15.087
production. As I mentioned, I know now how little I 
know about the benthos. I don't think that I could

05:19.814 --> 05:27.425
contribute much to the phytoplankton research, 
and I think much is left in zooplankton research.

05:27.445 --> 05:35.357
But in contrast to my earlier work, which was 
concerned with distribution, I think now more has

05:27.445 --> 05:35.357
to be done in the lab. Through the modeling effort, 
well, because for the modeling effort we need the

05:37.312 --> 05:44.341
coefficients. But through the modeling effort, I 
also have learned what the problems are with work

05:44.361 --> 05:53.833
at sea, with substantiating models at sea. And 
here I agree very much with Dugdale, who continues

05:53.853 --> 05:59.641
to go to sea to check his theories. I think because 
of the... I'll put it this way. If you want to

06:05.388 --> 06:06.610
test... our ideas about growth rates of 
zooplankton, independence of food supply and the

06:06.995 --> 06:20.031
effect of predation, we have to really come back to 
the same population, revisit the same population

06:06.995 --> 06:20.031
several times. But that can't be done in the open 
ocean because of the currents. So in the open ocean

06:23.315 --> 06:27.180
you always have to compound or always The open 
ocean always compounds the time and the space

06:27.869 --> 06:32.918
issue. And in order to verify a model or test a 
model, you have to keep the space domain separate

06:32.938 --> 06:40.632
from the time domain. And what you are interested 
in is usually the development in time. So I feel

06:43.698 --> 06:58.837
very much attracted now by, oh, I am convinced that 
if we were to apply our model ideas and our

06:43.698 --> 06:58.837
laboratory coefficients to natural waters, we 
have to go to enclosures. We have to enclose the

06:58.977 --> 07:06.787
water and thus then come back to the same 
populations every day or every week, whatever it

06:58.977 --> 07:06.787
is. Now, an enclosure, of course, is not an 
entirely natural situation. but in the marine

07:10.732 --> 07:36.790
domain but of course in freshwater a lake is a 
natural unit and that is enclosed water so I have

07:10.732 --> 07:36.790
now taught this during at the occasion of recent 
job offers of going to limnology many of the

07:10.732 --> 07:36.790
processes in water in plankton at least are the 
same there's lots of literature to draw on and

07:10.732 --> 07:36.790
shouldn't or might it not be that the important, 
the next big step forward in secondary production

07:37.698 --> 07:51.073
of plankton be made by the limnologists by virtue 
of them being able to revisit population. So I

07:51.794 --> 08:05.730
developed more and more interest in limnology, 
which is of course easy because in the department

07:51.794 --> 08:05.730
of zoology, he is an eminent zoologist, eminent 
limnologist Edmondson, from whom I greatly

07:51.794 --> 08:05.730
benefited. So there is something to be said about 
lakes, but if I do not change the terminology, then

08:06.166 --> 08:19.343
the next step would be to work on large plastic 
enclosures, as they are now being developed in

08:06.166 --> 08:19.343
several parts of the country. So the point being to 
revisit populations and test whether you can

08:20.124 --> 08:31.498
describe the future state of population from the 
initial state, by means of a model, and then test

08:31.681 --> 08:36.790
whether your prediction, the future state, is 
correct. That is what I think is important. In

08:40.516 --> 08:50.173
other words, I don't think that by going out to sea, 
with a model as Daktil or without a model as Said, we

08:40.516 --> 08:50.173
will get very far. But that is my opinion. And

08:51.977 --> 08:56.845
I guess that is all. That is what I'm going to do 
next, hopefully the textbook, and of course

08:57.078 --> 09:09.492
continue teaching, obviously, along these 
lines, and do something about secondary

08:57.078 --> 09:09.492
production. And the key idea being to focus on 
population we can revisit. Any regrets on how your

09:16.499 --> 09:18.381
career went? Do you wish you'd made a different 
choice along the way? No, I don't think so, no.

09:24.854 --> 09:27.097
Well, of course, would I have to do it again? I 
would, or if I have to advise somebody how to do it

09:27.117 --> 09:34.966
better, is to take, having better training, more 
mathematical training. That is where I'm very,

09:35.427 --> 09:42.075
very weak, such that I sometimes can't read the 
literature, leave alone do original work. And

09:43.297 --> 09:44.919
nobody told me, how could I know? That is my great 
weakness. But otherwise, no, no regrets. In

09:53.238 --> 10:00.648
hindsight, these years in India seem to be wasted, 
but then I discovered an upvailing area, so that's

09:53.238 --> 10:00.648
all right, I guess. And some people have served two 
years in the army and regard that as wasted. No, I

10:06.455 --> 10:08.318
don't have regrets. And Seattle is very pleasant 
to live. And so you're happy you opted for an

10:13.304 --> 10:17.650
American university? Yeah. Although in 
university life, of course, never things are

10:17.790 --> 10:22.536
permanent. It's not out of the question that I 
would go back to Europe, but it's unlikely because

10:22.769 --> 10:33.117
I had several offers and each time there was a flaw 
in the ornament.
