00:04.756 --> 00:21.613
The following is an interview between Elmer 
Sparks, Texas ranchman and historian,

00:04.756 --> 00:21.613
with Charlie Smith, old-time slave of Bartow, 
Florida.

00:29.681 --> 00:32.945
We've already got on the introduction on it. Okay. 
Is it turning? Yes. Mitch Smith, what is your full

00:34.878 --> 00:38.903
name? Charlie Smith. Charlie Smith. The man who 
raised me named me Charlie Smith. My first name,

00:44.669 --> 00:51.798
the first name that my mother named me is Mitchell. 
Mitchell Watkins. That's what my mother and

00:55.702 --> 00:57.965
father named me. Mitchell Watkins. I was raised in 
that. I was born in Africa and come from the United

00:59.787 --> 01:04.092
States. You see, that was in slavery time. They 
sold the colored people. They sold the colored

01:09.566 --> 01:11.668
people. And they bring them up from Africa. And 
they brought me from Africa. I was a child, a boy.

01:20.277 --> 01:23.560
The colored folks wanted to throw me off. The boat 
coming from Africa. Throw them overboard. I'd get

01:29.185 --> 01:30.667
cut. Throw them overboard. Let the damn whale 
swallow him like it done Jonah. Hadn't it been that

01:35.375 --> 01:39.540
the colored one wanted to throw me off. Hadn't it 
been for the lay green, and the captain of the boat,

01:39.560 --> 01:48.292
the lay green was a white man, and the captain of the 
boat was a white man. But the colored one wanted to

01:48.312 --> 01:51.856
throw me off the boat. And David Jack, when they 
bring him from Africa, Liberia, Africa, where I

01:51.876 --> 02:04.993
was born, and put in the United States, but the 
northern people Bought colored folks. Put you up

02:07.852 --> 02:10.776
on a block and said, big job. The highest it better 
get you. The highest it better get you. The

02:17.084 --> 02:21.630
northern people bought colored folks. And the 
south bought colored folks. And the northern

02:25.655 --> 02:29.440
people didn't care at all. Colored people. Till 
the north said it's too cold. For them, you know, to

02:34.346 --> 02:35.908
stand the cold. But they've got several white 
folks. They've got several white folks that look

02:40.170 --> 02:49.262
at them, and they pay the white folks, several 
white folks, to look at them. And they've got to

02:49.282 --> 02:53.767
mistreat

02:49.282 --> 02:53.767
them. And they come down the north and the south, 
the first part of the wall, the three of the colors,

02:53.787 --> 03:02.739
the north and south part of the wall. And that is the 
slavery time. And freedom... And he said, I ain't

03:06.263 --> 03:11.111
reading for you because I couldn't read. I knew 
something had to be done. And the man, he put you up

03:13.534 --> 03:18.662
on the block to sell you, to bid you all. And then he 
come down here in freedom, he bought the whole

03:20.025 --> 03:29.119
state of Louisiana and gave it to the club people 
for their territory. And they did all the rules. He

03:32.704 --> 03:33.165
said, And the colored people sold their rights. 
Sold out to the white. Sold to the white. And that's

03:39.622 --> 03:41.984
freedom. There's no freedom in the north and 
south, far from water. First of all, we're living

03:45.188 --> 03:47.430
in the United States. North and south, far from 
water. The free, the colored people don't stay

03:50.013 --> 03:53.737
every time. I was reading for it, because I 
couldn't read it. I knew it, because I was in the

03:56.240 --> 03:59.223
crew. The crew. The colored people always did hate 
me from a child bringing me from Africa. The

04:07.054 --> 04:08.876
colored wanted to throw me off the boat. Throw me 
overboard. Curse. Throw me overboard. Let me

04:13.703 --> 04:15.365
curse. Let me die. How did you come to be on the 
block, get out, and brought over here? Was you

04:20.012 --> 04:21.754
brought over by surprise? Well, they brought me 
over here. The North, they sold the colored

04:24.698 --> 04:28.283
people. And they tricked you to get you on the boat. 
And they what? They fooled you on the boat. They

04:33.770 --> 04:35.453
fooled the colored people on the boat. I asked my 
mama, could I go down to the boat landing to see that

04:37.055 --> 04:41.541
white man? I was raised in Africa. That was in 
Africa. I was raised one day in Africa with white

04:49.133 --> 04:54.921
folks. Didn't know white people stay in Africa, 
south part of Africa. They stayed in the north part

04:59.488 --> 05:02.132
of Africa. And they were the solely colored people 
in the south part of Africa. They put you up on a

05:07.540 --> 05:09.883
block and did you all. And the way they got us on the 
boat, he said, come back in here. That was the city.

05:20.819 --> 05:24.264
Come in young, cooler than you, all the cooler. 
Over in that country, you don't have to wait. If you

05:31.533 --> 05:36.500
get hungry, all you got to do is go to the flutter 
tree. Had the flutter tree on the boat, clean, got

05:36.520 --> 05:40.425
the flutter tree. You go to the flutter tree. Same 
thing that people call, you know, they call them

05:43.640 --> 05:49.629
pancakes, they call them flippers. Them flipper 
trees, bad that. That tree's bad, the flippers are

05:54.035 --> 05:57.040
clean. Here's a flipper tree. It's on the boat. He 
got on it. There's a flipper tree on the boat. Come

06:05.051 --> 06:06.774
on down here. Call the Lord Nick on the, call the 
flipper tree, then show us the syrup tree. Here's a

06:13.120 --> 06:14.782
syrup tree. Oh, it is on the boat, too. Come on down 
here. And they call it on the lower deck on the boat,

06:20.269 --> 06:24.494
they keep calling it the hatch hole. Come on down 
here in that hatch hole to show something down

06:25.355 --> 06:29.540
there. Got out of the hatch hole, we said, well, the 
boat's moving. Well, we thought it was going back

06:33.024 --> 06:36.929
up there to the flutter tree. And it's leaving. And 
when it landed, it landed, and he won't leave. The

06:42.223 --> 06:43.484
colored people were so red. So the dangling men of 
South Africa over here, the colored folks won the

06:45.187 --> 06:53.398
story all. So I'm on the boat. I'm on the boat. And 
the white, what is it? Don't you throw that boy up

07:00.608 --> 07:02.010
there. Put him on the boat, got down, let the damn 
whale swallow him like a dumb Jonah, that's what

07:02.699 --> 07:07.584
they said. Don't throw me off the boat. Made me from 
Africa and the United States. Got us over here to

07:13.391 --> 07:16.254
slave them. Just put you on the block to slave them. 
Put you up on the stage, because the court is a

07:18.677 --> 07:21.860
block. Put you up on the stage. Just a matter of 
body. The highest bill will get you. Get on it. The

07:27.947 --> 07:29.328
highest bill will get you. He'll carry his 
plantation. Put another one up there. The highest

07:33.610 --> 07:35.311
bridge we've ever been to. He was the most, he came 
to his plans. He had the white in the south. And they

07:39.936 --> 07:43.700
went to mistreatin' him, the colored. Gettin' 
shown by the colored women. You know, all the

07:46.222 --> 07:47.444
cities there. Gettin' colored. And the white find 
it out, how they was treatin' him, they didn't do

07:48.665 --> 07:53.790
anything. And you come down here, the First World 
War, over in the United States, this is north and

07:53.810 --> 08:00.617
south, throughout the world, the free, the 
colored. Who was it that bought you? Do you

08:02.399 --> 08:04.501
remember who bought you? Bought me? Yeah. Oh, I was 
with them. Went to New Orleans. That's where they

08:11.229 --> 08:13.331
sold the people. The man raised me. He didn't buy 
me. The man raised me. They were trying to put you up

08:17.436 --> 08:20.039
on the block to sell you. He was Jake. The man was 
Jake. He named me. That's the name I'm going now.

08:25.064 --> 08:27.127
Charlie Smith. He named me when he took me. He 
raised me in Texas, Galveston, Texas, where I was

08:30.871 --> 08:36.379
raised in. And the man that raised me named Charlie 
Smith, and that's the name he gave me. He gave me

08:40.065 --> 08:41.968
Charlie Smith. He always teach me. And his 
children, he treated me just like he treated his

08:44.712 --> 08:48.418
children. And everything, not one thing, 
everything. And we ate together, we slept

08:51.723 --> 08:53.826
together. Oh, the boys now, we can sleep in little 
women now. He was born, he lived together. He was a

09:00.107 --> 09:04.472
cattle man, Charlie Smith. He had all kind of 
cattle. And all of us tore his pistols and sent him

09:07.436 --> 09:10.139
to shoot. And I was on this colored cowboy. I got on a 
cowboy shirt and I brought him to Texas. Ben had it

09:18.830 --> 09:21.332
all my days. I'd raise up a cowboy. I was the only 
cowboy, full of cowboys he had within Texas. His

09:28.178 --> 09:36.565
name was Charlie Smith, and he always teach me and 
his children, anything you got to have, don't

09:28.178 --> 09:36.565
never let it give out. And saying, enjoy your 
money. When you're living, you can't get none of

09:40.068 --> 09:43.911
the reason when you're dead. He said, 
millionaires die when they leave all their cars

09:44.992 --> 09:48.195
behind. Everything they got, they ain't had 
nothing with

09:48.648 --> 09:54.557
them. His name was Charlie Smith, and he named me 
Charlie Smith. And he always told me, don't say my

09:58.003 --> 10:00.006
name. And when he died, he had three or four of them. 
He didn't put no money in no bank. He had these

10:11.092 --> 10:13.654
little money safes. People got them now in some 
places. In the houses, you know. He had two in his

10:17.419 --> 10:23.705
drug store, in his dry goods store, and two in his 
grocery store. That made four. That's where he

10:25.427 --> 10:28.291
kept his money and all his cowboy money. What we 
didn't take. We, all cowboys, wore boots. Half a

10:34.767 --> 10:40.576
leg boots and knee, what you call knee boots, that 
come clean to your knee. Well, we pulled it out over

10:40.877 --> 10:42.759
here. He said to us, we pulled it out of boots. And I 
was the only colored cowboy he had. All the rest of

10:48.248 --> 10:49.730
them was white. We pulled pistols.

10:55.321 --> 10:57.704
paddlers and things like that. When he got stuck, 
he was a cattle man. He worked for the cattle. And

11:02.209 --> 11:08.315
all the animals, bells, paddlers, and things like 
that, and rams. He got to deal with pigs and those

11:09.056 --> 11:12.580
young stuff. That's what we used to do. Cowboys 
came to pistol and rifle to kill them. Now, what did

11:18.146 --> 11:21.670
you do after the slaves were freed? After you was 
with him? with him. Well, you just wonder how

11:24.779 --> 11:27.242
they're working, huh? Well, you know, when they 
freed the color, you just see, the man would, when

11:27.262 --> 11:46.124
they freed the color, they bought the whole state 
of Louisiana and gave the color people their

11:27.262 --> 11:46.124
territory to make their laws and rules. And the 
color people sold the rights. All they had to do was

11:48.667 --> 11:51.771
get up in the woods and property anything, You have 
to get them through butter white. Now, that's the

11:55.310 --> 11:58.154
way to do it. You ain't got no, can't make no laws, 
can't make no rules. If they make them white, let

12:02.100 --> 12:06.466
them have them sold out. Now, after he died, then 
where did you go then? After who died? After this

12:11.213 --> 12:12.695
Charlie Smith. He ain't dead. Well, I mean, the one 
that... Oh, he did, all right, but where he went, I

12:14.698 --> 12:20.847
went and he sold the colored folks. After he sold 
the colored people. After the slavery time, he

12:25.596 --> 12:30.787
sold the colored folks. And then the first war was 
in the north and the south spot war. The north

12:37.921 --> 12:39.544
bought colored people. And the South bought 
colored folks. And the North got the Southern

12:43.266 --> 12:48.895
white folks to look after them and take care of 
them. The little Cam North said it was too cold for

12:48.935 --> 12:54.603
them and got the Southern white folks to look after 
them. And the Southern white folks went to

12:54.623 --> 12:57.868
mistreat them. Did you go out West then? No, I 
wasn't in the West. I wasn't in the West then, yeah.

13:03.817 --> 13:05.720
I was in the West when they freed them. That's what I 
mean, after they freed them. Yeah, after they

13:08.104 --> 13:09.666
freed them, I was in the West. Charlie, when he went 
to selling them, he rejected selling me. Put you up

13:18.159 --> 13:19.260
on the block. He rejected. Because he ruled that 
part of Texas. He was a cattle man. And he ruled that

13:25.306 --> 13:27.609
part of John Ruston. He ruled that part. And what he 
said, he went. And when he said he wanted to sell me,

13:32.594 --> 13:37.479
put me on the block, he rejected. And he didn't do 
it. And he raised me, came to his house, and he

13:38.570 --> 13:42.393
raised me. He named me Charlie. His name was 
Charlie, and he named me Charlie. His name was

13:49.420 --> 13:51.582
Charlie Smith. That's the name he gave me. That's 
my name, what my mother and father named me. My

13:56.326 --> 13:57.907
name, Mitchell. Mitchell Watkins. But he stole 
me, and he got me. And he named me Charlie. That's

14:03.292 --> 14:04.313
the name I grew in. And when he died, He died. And 
when he died, he always teach me and his children.

14:14.361 --> 14:16.483
Didn't teach us one thing, he teach us all. He said, 
anything you got to have, don't never let it rip

14:17.764 --> 14:21.527
out. You know what I'm saying? Enjoy your money 
when you're living. Because you can't take none of

14:27.773 --> 14:30.456
it with you when you're dead. Enjoy your money when 
you're living. He teach us that all the time. And I

14:35.441 --> 14:38.023
didn't go to school. But I thought I hadn't been 
used to taking those pistols and nothing to shoot

14:38.476 --> 14:44.205
with. And I was so full of more pistols and rifles I 
had to carry. And I didn't do anything else. But I

14:51.376 --> 14:53.038
was on this color boy. All these cowboys were 
white. We all ate together. We slept together.

14:59.428 --> 14:59.888
Everything. There was no difference in the 
treatment at all. None. None. Did you move up to

15:06.016 --> 15:09.460
Mississippi? Didn't you move to Mississippi? Oh, 
I've been all over. You worked in Mississippi,

15:15.088 --> 15:16.810
didn't you? I'm a state man, mister. I worked for 
the United States. I worked with bad people. I'm a

15:22.577 --> 15:25.401
state man. I'm a state man. I'm the man who made the 
kid man and got the man to kill the president. And

15:36.121 --> 15:37.482
the state named me. I got three names. The United 
States, I went for the United States now. They

15:44.009 --> 15:45.171
named me Trigger Kid. Me and Billy the Kid went and 
got the man, killed the president. Went and got

15:49.135 --> 15:49.835
him. Had a $500 reward in the boat to go give him. He 
killed the president. Get talk, killed Garfield.

15:57.964 --> 16:01.808
Garfield was the first president that was killed 
with the United States. And the man killed him

16:02.446 --> 16:08.153
named Gittor, and he went back over to his state, 
where he'd come from. And it was Charles Gittor,

16:08.173 --> 16:10.276
wasn't it? And they just put out $500 for water, and 
everybody would go get him. There was six men right

16:15.001 --> 16:18.706
at the line of the states. You had to get stories 
from them to go over there. Everybody would go over

16:23.572 --> 16:26.996
there to get him for $500. Them men would kill him. 
Kill him. Six men. They kill you. If you go over

16:32.716 --> 16:39.286
there and get that man, the man done to kill him, he 
went back in that state, because that's the state

16:32.716 --> 16:39.286
he was born and raised in. And there's six men right 
in the line of the United States. And you had to get

16:44.393 --> 16:47.638
started from them to go in the foot in that state. 
And we, me and Billy the Kid, the son of, the United

16:49.180 --> 17:00.297
States, named me Trevor Kid, but that's the name I 
gave him. It's running.

17:05.726 --> 17:26.419
It's running.

17:27.327 --> 17:29.690
You picked some fruit, didn't you? You've done 
quite a lot of fruit picking. Oh, I've done all

17:31.873 --> 17:34.516
kinds. Here, right here. Here.

17:39.422 --> 17:41.284
Here's my picture. Me and this man, that's my 
picture. And that's my age. And it's a stroke.

17:47.732 --> 17:49.114
That's a white man. Me and him were the two oldest 
people in the world at that time. I was standing at

17:54.401 --> 17:56.824
the town of Coalman, you know, right there. 
Mm-hmm. I was picking fruit in the United States.

18:04.309 --> 18:07.253
They told me you were picking fruit when you were 
113. Is that right? Oh, right. Don't you see?

18:09.676 --> 18:12.540
That's it. That's it. If I tell them that, they 
don't hear me. That's really a mistake. It's a

18:16.545 --> 18:17.206
print. It's something to me to show people. In the 
United States. I'm going to work for the United

18:20.790 --> 18:22.632
States now. I'm a state man. I'd wait for the United 
States. I'd go get bad people, white or black,

18:26.962 --> 18:32.928
don't care how old, who he is. If I got, if we do the 
wrong thing, I'd go on a United States marriage as

18:32.948 --> 18:37.793
long as I live. Were you interviewed by Robert 
Ripley? You remember that Robert Ripley? Robert

18:42.798 --> 18:46.241
Ripley, he's right there, that's living or not. 
Well, I remember old, old bad people. White or

18:50.217 --> 18:51.720
black. This Ripley's the man you're pictured with 
there, Charlie. Yeah, that's it. Actually,

18:56.969 --> 18:58.532
that's the reason I had to kill him. I showed it to 
people. Me and this man was the two oldest people in

18:59.594 --> 19:04.182
the world and required us to meet. That's a white 
man. In the state named me Trevor Kidd. Me and Billy

19:09.131 --> 19:12.077
Kidd went and got the man to kill the president. 
Guitar killed Garfield. Garfield was the

19:14.602 --> 19:20.531
president of the United States. He killed him. Get 
tall. Kill Garfield. And everybody go over there

19:26.039 --> 19:31.928
to get him, put him $500, they'd kill him. There 
were six men right at the line of the states. And

19:35.553 --> 19:39.399
everybody go over there to get the man, kill the 
president. That's what state he was raised in, the

19:39.419 --> 19:41.742
man down to kill him. He'd go back in that state. 
That's the state he was born and raised in. Do you

19:46.831 --> 19:49.395
remember what state that was, Charlie? What? The 
state where this Garfield went back in, guitar.

19:55.002 --> 19:55.904
Yeah, I don't know. I don't remember. I've got it 
now. But I know he went back in the state. Yeah,

raised in. And when he got to kill the man, he went

line, or both at the moment. 60 men. Everybody goes

him. Gittar killed Garfield. Garfield was the

20:21.317 --> 20:25.941
first president that was killed in the United 
States. And Gittar killed him and went back in that

everybody went there to get him. Them six men that

20:34.210 --> 20:37.033

them. And they shot me and Billy the Kid. The state

20:45.727 --> 20:49.852

white man. When I went over there, it was red up

There were them 60 men. Told them 60 men was hooking

22:04.759 --> 22:06.021

campaign, you know, the God was there. The God was

22:11.572 --> 22:12.953

raised me, gave me the name I got, Charlie Smith. I

22:33.954 --> 22:36.717

later. Were you about 113 when the Social Security

22:39.635 --> 22:45.262

That's what I'm saying. I don't show it to you. And

year, 4th of July. 144 years old now. My birthday,

23:06.953 --> 23:13.441
I'll get the birthday card on my 144th, last 
Thursday of July, last year. On my 144th. And you

23:16.105 --> 23:17.787

worn none. And you don't wear a hearing aid, is that

23:19.549 --> 23:21.291

here. I see good as hell. The United States takes

23:28.300 --> 23:29.822
care of me. The United States. If I, if they stand me 
there at you, or read out on the ditch, I don't see

23:34.105 --> 23:40.252
you. I'm demanding straightened up walk shooter.

23:45.478 --> 23:46.059
There's something in there. A couple of people 
didn't come to stay there. If you could go uptown

23:50.004 --> 23:53.748
with a heavy standing walk shooter, I'd 
straighten it up. The state's something in there

23:54.789 --> 23:57.372
to straighten it. Now there's a couple of people on 
the property there. Right through here in the walk

23:59.014 --> 24:02.458
shooter. The colored porter couldn't get off the 
train then. White folks didn't allow them to get

24:08.082 --> 24:10.024
off the train. The colored porter on the train 
couldn't get off then. There stayed something

24:12.707 --> 24:14.569
there. Straightened it up. I straightened it. The 
colored porter couldn't get off then. And I

24:19.594 --> 24:22.757
colored people on the property and walked you up. I 
had to go to your officer. Sign was painted up

24:25.340 --> 24:26.781
there. I said, that's for you. Put the sign and say, 
read, negate, and run. I wasn't going to sign it. It

24:35.480 --> 24:36.501
states something in there. I said, go tear that 
sign down. I said, if you need any help, let us know.

24:43.933 --> 24:45.735
I went there. The sign was right up there. I said, 
read, nigger, and run. He asked me, you got

24:51.785 --> 24:54.889
thoughties? I said, yeah, I've got thoughties. 
Present your thoughties. Hear my goddamn

24:59.897 --> 25:03.242
thoughties and hear my help. He's 45. I tore it 
down. At Oxford. I tore it down. Anywhere the

25:14.035 --> 25:17.480
states tell me to go and do, I do this. Now. Ever 
since I've been waiting for the United States.

25:21.786 --> 25:24.349
I've been waiting for the United States a hundred 
years. When I go over there. New Brown to the Mason

25:26.332 --> 25:28.015
Lodge? Yeah. I was a mason. I've been pussing. The 
time I got old enough, I was put in, the man raised

25:32.568 --> 25:37.933
me, put me in the mason. I've been a mason a hundred 
years. If I weren't a mason, I couldn't join you.

25:44.620 --> 25:50.566
And any other man, get my age, any boy, white or 
black, you can get too old to join the mason. You can

25:51.607 --> 25:53.148
get too young to join. And when I got old enough, the 
man put me in the mason. One man, Charlotte, he put

25:57.413 --> 25:59.875
me in the mason. If I want one, I couldn't go. That's 
in a ring, but it just sits. Dropped out of the

26:05.627 --> 26:07.309
square and clumped. He dropped that out. Well, I'm 
a mason. That was a ring. That was sitting between

26:13.316 --> 26:15.578
that ring. He dropped out. I was in a mason 100 
years. One man, Charlie, put me in the mason. I'm

26:25.089 --> 26:28.613
the first colored man over a male mason in the 
United States. If I wasn't wanting that one, not

26:30.112 --> 26:36.479
only me, nobody got age. You can get too old to join 
the Masons. And you can get too young to join the

26:39.803 --> 26:42.826
Masons. If I wasn't now, now I couldn't be because I 
was too old. And anybody my age, white or black, you

26:48.492 --> 26:52.657
can't join the Masons at that age. I know it. I've 
been a Mason 100 years. I know Masons. Speaking of

26:58.360 --> 27:01.325
cowboys, we're both cowboys. We're right out 
of... Oh, yeah, I'm the only color cowboy man

27:01.365 --> 27:06.974
Charlie had. He had a pen of cowboys, but I was the 
only one he had. He raised me. How many were there in

27:12.823 --> 27:15.647
your family originally? Oh, my family? Yeah. Oh, 
do I... Your mother... I didn't have but one

27:18.892 --> 27:23.600
brother and two sisters. Three sisters, but the 
baby sister. My two older sisters, one of them was

27:26.238 --> 27:33.047
named, one of them, both of them were married 
already, my oldest. My baby sister, she was a

27:33.067 --> 27:35.030
little kid. She was the baby of all the children. I 
had one brother. His name was Simon Wardington. My

27:42.379 --> 27:45.363
name, what my mother said, his name was Mitchell 
Wardington. The man who had the only name was

27:46.184 --> 27:48.587
Charlie Smith. That's the white man who raised me 
in Texas. Charlie Smith. And he treated me just

27:53.997 --> 27:56.860
like he treated his children. And everything, we 
ate together, slept together. And when he died,

28:00.985 --> 28:06.992
people bragged on preachers. Say good and so on and 
all that good. When he died, I gave him money to

28:11.077 --> 28:17.845
preach, to pray on preachers. I gave them money to 
treat them, because I wanted to talk to myself. All

28:24.192 --> 28:27.717
the cowboys told us we were boots, and what money we 
didn't. The old man Charlie didn't keep us. We kept

28:30.421 --> 28:32.163
it ourselves, and I was boots. And I was the only 
colored cowboy. And we all read together, and we

28:37.191 --> 28:39.735
all ate together. Not one time, all the time. And I 
treated you just like my wife. Did you? You worked

28:47.299 --> 28:50.683
in Mississippi one time, did you? Yeah, I went 
there with Will Wayne. When that picture there was

28:53.726 --> 28:58.271
struck, I was standing right down the road there at 
Coal Almond. When that picture was struck,

28:58.291 --> 29:04.297
someone else stood there and would call the radar. 
I wonder if we haven't about covered this, and

29:04.958 --> 29:09.002
we'll take some pictures. And so, thank you, and we 
will take some pictures here.
