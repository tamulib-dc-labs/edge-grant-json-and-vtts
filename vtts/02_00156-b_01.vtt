WEBVTT

00:03.355 --> 00:09.528
Well they had movies in Guyon Hall that were pretty 
inexpensive. I can remember going to them on

00:10.469 --> 00:18.265
Saturday evening and the campus theater was 
there. There were two theaters in downtown Bryan

00:18.907 --> 00:22.073
or three. One of them is the one that burned, you 
know, that has, I don't remember going to a lot of

00:22.390 --> 00:34.539
movies, but I remember going to a few. And you never 
were a smoker? No.

00:41.088 --> 00:44.591
I didn't uh, I didn't ever really get started. I 
smoked a few cigarettes my freshman year, decided

00:44.852 --> 00:54.161
that it was done, and just never did go any further. 
Uh, uh, did you and your buddies go to the MSC much?

01:01.808 --> 01:02.549
Snack bar? Cokes, coffee? Yeah, I remember uh, uh, 
going for uh some kind you know a coke or a coffee or

01:11.632 --> 01:39.310
something in the MSC and I was just talking to 
someone the other day uh there was a friend of mine

01:11.632 --> 01:39.310
Doug With that I have you know knew all of his life 
after that point in history but I remember the

01:11.632 --> 01:39.310
first time I met him was in the MSC in that coffee 
shop he was a senior the year I was a freshman so

01:39.982 --> 02:09.887
those things

01:39.982 --> 02:09.887
living in the core with this responsibility to 
meet everybody to remember where they're from to

01:39.982 --> 02:09.887
remember where they're what they're majoring in 
and everything it just made you it made

01:39.982 --> 02:09.887
individuals made impressions on you that you know 
stayed with you for years and years was it in the

01:39.982 --> 02:09.887
long run was that a good a good practice Was it worth 
the effort? Yes. I think that there were some

02:13.786 --> 02:17.432
really positive things about the Corps. There 
were some negatives, too, but the... What were the

02:17.933 --> 02:24.343
positives? Well, being personally responsible 
for meeting people and being able to, you know,

02:34.319 --> 03:01.018
have a conversation with anybody in the world and

02:34.319 --> 03:01.018
to you know remember who they were when you saw them 
again and after a while we got very good at

02:34.319 --> 03:01.018
remembering names and you know we had a unit of a 
hundred people we knew everybody's name where

02:34.319 --> 03:01.018
they were all from what their majors were In a lot of 
cases, if they had a brother that had come to A&M, we

03:01.741 --> 03:07.246
knew that. So any A&M connection in these 
families, we would more than likely know

03:07.606 --> 03:15.634
something about that. Most of the people I knew 
were the first, we were the first person in the

03:16.354 --> 03:23.401
family that had ever gone to A&M. So it was more 
unusual in those days to have your father to have

03:23.461 --> 03:31.748
been an A&M graduate. Did you get involved in any 
MSC activities or were they not yet well

03:33.145 --> 03:39.113
organized? The MSC was not too far along at that 
time as far as a campus organization. I know just a

03:47.663 --> 03:59.338
year or two after me, one of my 4-H friends, his name 
was Don McGinty and he he became very active and

03:59.977 --> 04:09.468
eventually became a MSC council president, one of 
the first ones, I guess. So I was in the club for

04:11.310 --> 04:26.027
range and forestry students and I was in the Alpha 
Zeta agricultural fraternity. I was on the Ag

04:26.047 --> 04:28.009
Council. I, of course, I was in the Ross 
Volunteers. I was in the debate, on the debate

04:36.179 --> 04:39.402
team. Those are the, the main things I remember. 
There was Phi Kappa Phi my senior year. So,

04:48.870 --> 04:57.338
so there were a lot of evening activities after my, 
freshman year. I don't remember doing any of that

04:58.995 --> 05:01.840
my freshman year. Alright, you came back that fall 
of your sophomore year with a car? Yes, some,

05:08.591 --> 05:15.201
right, I think actually sometime during my 
sophomore year I got that car. What kind of car was

05:15.221 --> 05:16.824
it? It was a 1941 Chevrolet Coupe. So this is. I had 
one of those. I wish I had that. Mine was a business

05:25.517 --> 05:26.598
coupe. Yeah this was uh it was a coupe it had a sun 
visor on it it had fender skirts on it it had it had a

05:26.718 --> 05:43.881
metallic green paint job that you could see from 
them two miles away you know it was a beautiful

05:26.718 --> 05:43.881
thing. A vehicle that was 10-11 years old did you 
think of that as an old car or kind of a? Well it was

05:50.970 --> 05:53.734
kind of an old car but I didn't really think of it as 
being a negative, you know. There were, it was,

05:58.643 --> 06:07.178
you, if you had a car you were still above average at 
that point. Where did you park it? Well there were,

06:10.343 --> 06:14.050
there were parking lots near the dorms. I was in 
dorm 12 that year. Because you didn't have to have a

06:16.734 --> 06:18.237
sticker. I guess so. And you never did have any, 
didn't have any breaking or? No. I don't remember

06:26.226 --> 06:34.440
ever having anybody ever talking about a car being 
stolen or a car being broken into. Did you become a

06:34.480 --> 06:43.735
more popular guy with your associates once you got 
a car that they would want to ride with you or borrow

06:34.480 --> 06:43.735
it? I don't remember that I don't remember that I 
don't remember loaning it out a lot and I guess if

06:45.942 --> 07:06.297
I'd been you know if I'd been going out at night well 
that but even as even as sophomores we still had a

07:07.137 --> 07:13.306
lot of restrictions on where we could go and 
whether we could leave the campus or not. How was

07:13.626 --> 07:16.470
being a sophomore different from being a 
freshman?

07:19.695 --> 07:35.637
Well, I decided that as a sophomore I wanted to

07:19.695 --> 07:35.637
do the academics, do the leadership things, and I 
was not particularly interested in harassing

07:19.695 --> 07:35.637
freshmen. I didn't. So the main thing that I 
remember about being a sophomore was the pressure

07:37.428 --> 07:45.040
of being in the Corps was less. And where was your 
outfit then, physically? Physically, that year

07:48.906 --> 07:54.855
it seems like we were in Dormitory 12 next door to 
Sabisa. Excuse me, Duncan. To Duncan. Yeah,

07:57.880 --> 08:00.003
right. And so you didn't harass the, you didn't? 
Oh, not a lot. Did somebody come and take care of

08:07.114 --> 08:11.880
your room or do any cleaning up for you? No. No. 
There was not much personal service. That was an

08:19.209 --> 08:25.598
ongoing problem, but I, you know, rarely ever saw 
that. Rarely was, I was, as a freshman, I was never

08:25.998 --> 08:30.744
asked to give personal service. As a sophomore, 
because we were the low-ranking people in the

08:32.812 --> 08:59.112
unit, occasionally somebody would want their 
boots polished, and then it was a real judgment

08:32.812 --> 08:59.112
call as to whether you said no or whether you did it, 
you know, and some people would say no and other

08:32.812 --> 08:59.112
people would be afraid to say no, and they would do 
the boot polishing, but that was about the extent

08:32.812 --> 08:59.112
of the personal service. And you're digging in on 
your grades. Have you, by that point, changed your

09:02.090 --> 09:10.102
mind as to what you hoped your future goal was going 
to be professionally? I think by that time I was

09:11.604 --> 09:31.793
beginning to realize that I was going to need to 
find a job and make a living not as a

09:11.604 --> 09:31.793
rancher, but as somebody developing a 
profession. But my vision was not beyond the BS at

09:32.701 --> 09:37.345
that time. And I,

09:38.106 --> 09:49.096
for reasons that I don't understand now, became, 
you know, convinced that I was not going to go to

09:38.106 --> 09:49.096
graduate school. I was just going to be a regular 
fellow, you know. I'm going to get a BS and go out and

09:51.578 --> 09:56.502
make a living and that was going to be it. And I 
persisted in that until I graduated and worked for

10:02.688 --> 10:16.601
a while and was so discouraged

10:02.688 --> 10:16.601
by the apparent lack of opportunities in the area 
that I was working in. Now there weren't many

10:17.342 --> 10:21.306
graduate students on this campus then, were 
there? That's right. They weren't very visible

10:22.587 --> 10:29.033
and very unlikely you could talk to them. about 
what it was like and what they were doing. Did that

10:34.987 --> 10:48.306
sophomore year, were there, there weren't any 
particular changes on the campus, nothing,

10:34.987 --> 10:48.306
nothing unusual or anything? Not that I remember. 
that was the era that David Morgan came as

10:51.338 --> 11:19.050
president and I guess that we I thought that was a 
very positive thing and I heard him speak to the

10:51.338 --> 11:19.050
range and forestry club and I thought he was a very 
sensible man and he had a lot of good advice for us

10:51.338 --> 11:19.050
and he gave us a talk about

11:20.633 --> 11:22.835
how to get started in your career. And I remember he 
told us that the most likely thing that a graduate

11:23.476 --> 11:38.810
would do with his first job was quit in less than a 
year out of discouragement, you know, and

11:23.476 --> 11:38.810
thinking that he never could get anywhere and that 
sort of thing. And he said, if you do that, you make a

11:38.831 --> 11:41.974
mistake. And I remember that. But for some reason, 
he didn't last very long. That may have been my

11:49.760 --> 12:10.444
first exposure to, you know, sort of an ongoing 
problem at A&M of

11:49.760 --> 12:10.444
palace intrigues or turnover in the 
administration or personal conflicts between

11:49.760 --> 12:10.444
various people in the administration. Now, did 
you get, by this time, were you involved with the

12:11.465 --> 12:16.191
local congregation?

12:18.714 --> 12:19.615
No, I wasn't. I was

12:19.983 --> 12:27.873
my wife-to-be, and I were from different 
churches. And so during that time in my life, I was

12:27.913 --> 12:40.870
trying to decide what I was going to do about that as 
a possible problem for a marriage. And

12:41.811 --> 12:46.497
eventually, that was resolved.

12:46.966 --> 12:51.530
I became a member of the Church of Christ after we 
were married. Did you, while you were a student

12:52.011 --> 12:57.696
here, did you go to any religious services? I went 
to the Baptist Church at Northgate a little bit.

13:02.500 --> 13:11.249
Some of my acquaintances who were members of 
Churches of Christ took me to Bryan. I don't

13:11.269 --> 13:15.032
remember ever attending the Church of Christ in 
College Station while I was an undergraduate. Uh,

13:21.913 --> 13:29.519
and were there some Sunday night foods, foods 
available at some of those, uh, uh, events? I never

13:29.539 --> 13:33.123
got involved in any of that for some reason. I, I 
know that since then, you know, the church that I'm

13:33.143 --> 13:45.053
involved in now does a lot of that, you know, but I, I 
don't remember ever experiencing that. So for me,

13:45.893 --> 13:49.117
at Austin College, that was one of the big things. 
Because we didn't have Sunday night supper. They

13:51.560 --> 13:54.263
gave us a brown bag. But the Westminster 
Fellowship ladies cooked a meal, so we all. And we

13:59.850 --> 14:06.077
snickered that we were rice Christians, that we 
went only to get the list for the food. Do you

14:06.238 --> 14:09.702
remember Religious Emphasis Week during your 
undergraduate days? Yes. Describe it. What was it

14:11.344 --> 14:12.045
like? Well, it was a pretty big thing. in those days 
and I remember they had they had one

14:15.070 --> 14:35.070
session a day in Gine Hall everybody would go and 
listen and then there would be somebody either not

14:15.070 --> 14:35.070
not every dorm had a lounge in it but the dorms that 
had lounges would have discussion groups and

14:35.253 --> 14:54.460
these would be led by out of town ministers too and 
so it just would sort of depend on who you know I

14:35.253 --> 14:54.460
guess you didn't really have any control over who 
was assigned to the dorm where you were to go. But I

14:59.035 --> 15:08.524
remember going to all of those and thinking they 
were useful and productive and that the people had

14:59.035 --> 15:08.524
good ideas. And I would always come out feeling 
very optimistic and thinking, well, I'm going to

15:08.645 --> 15:14.771
be a better person and everything. And classes 
were dismissed mid-morning, weren't they? And

15:19.035 --> 15:24.480
wasn't there a sermon in or presentation in Guyon? 
Yes. Did I say rudder? Maybe I did. No, no, I don't

15:27.525 --> 15:29.108
know. So that was right. You had like 10 o'clock to 
11 or 10 o'clock to 11 30 or something. There was an

15:35.818 --> 15:41.408
hour off each day during that week. And I remember 
the attendance was pretty good. During

15:46.416 --> 15:50.923
the the Korean War is still going on during this 
time. Did you and your buddies talk about that much

15:53.749 --> 16:00.838
and chow and dining and dormitory and so forth? I 
don't remember talking about it much. There were

16:04.263 --> 16:16.219
people that were that were people that left school 
or people that flunked out were going immediately

16:04.263 --> 16:16.219
into the military. we had people that were 
graduating that were being killed before you know

16:16.672 --> 16:45.818
within a year of when they graduated I remember the 
guy that was the head jail leader my freshman year

16:16.672 --> 16:45.818
was dead before football season was over the next 
year or something like that so it was a ominous

16:16.672 --> 16:45.818
presence especially I remember feeling sort of 
really uh discouraged about the war during the

16:46.928 --> 17:13.577
time when the Chinese first entered the war and 
they were just sweeping down over overrunning

16:46.928 --> 17:13.577
units and everything and and we knew enough about 
that to know you know what what was happening there

16:46.928 --> 17:13.577
or sort of in in general what was happening but I 
never did

17:15.498 --> 17:21.104
I never did feel like that it was something that I 
needed to worry about personally. I really

17:21.665 --> 17:30.934
expected that when my four years was up that I 
would, you know, get ready and go and do my tour. And

17:31.976 --> 17:42.687
it was a bit of a surprise that it was actually 
settled before I graduated or shortly after I

17:31.976 --> 17:42.687
graduated.

17:43.966 --> 18:01.435
When I graduated, well, I had orders for, I think, 
December of the following, well, of that year, and

17:43.966 --> 18:01.435
those orders were changed then, and they were 
changed from two years active duty to to six months

18:02.360 --> 18:05.144
active duty for training. So that was sort of the, 
that was one of the events that probably pushed me

18:05.224 --> 18:17.480
in the direction of an academic career because it 
put... Did you go to summer camp after your

18:05.224 --> 18:17.480
sophomore year? After my junior year. Junior 
year. Yes. What was that like? Where was it and so

18:22.586 --> 18:23.808
forth? Summer camp for the Transportation Corps 
was at Fort Eustis, Virginia. Tidewater area, hot

18:29.782 --> 18:37.371
summers, humid, just like College Station. We 
were there with people from all over the United

18:38.873 --> 18:56.633
States, but I remember we had a big competition 
with the unit that had all of the Texas, University

18:38.873 --> 18:56.633
of Texas guys in it, and We were determined to have 
the best unit at summer camp, you know. So, and I

19:03.459 --> 19:07.763
think we ended up sort of in a dead heat with them. 
They didn't want us to show them up and so they did

19:07.803 --> 19:17.593
their best to compete with us on everything. Could 
you tell at summer camp that the Corps had given you

19:17.793 --> 19:24.240
and your buddies a good preparation? for active 
duty possibilities? Yes. And we were amazed at how

19:29.483 --> 19:38.720
little some of the guys were prepared for anything 
military. And we felt good about our preparation.

19:46.951 --> 20:04.136
Now there weren't any sudden events were there 
during your undergraduate days that you remember

19:46.951 --> 20:04.136
where you were when you heard the news that like 
Pearl Harbor for the earlier group and Kennedy

19:46.951 --> 20:04.136
assassination later there was nothing like that 
was there? No. A startling event that stopped

20:05.457 --> 20:07.621
everything? I don't remember anything like that 
while I was in school.

20:15.392 --> 20:16.333
Not at all. Were there any celebrity students? Who 
were the most visible students on the campus when

20:21.483 --> 20:29.766
you were here, then or now? Well then the celebrity 
students would have been either athletes or. Such

20:39.352 --> 20:39.933
as? There was a, there was a,

20:42.115 --> 20:57.694
I think it was during my undergraduate time there 
was a guy that was a football player and a shot

20:42.115 --> 20:57.694
putter named Darryl Hooper who competed in the 
Olympics. There was a guy named Davis who played

20:57.961 --> 21:06.749
basketball and was a high jumper and competed in 
the Olympics.

21:07.450 --> 21:10.412
Did guys like that go to class regularly, as far as 
you knew? As far as I knew, they did. Did you and your

21:12.254 --> 21:22.543
buddies know about any kind of crip courses or 
special giveaway grade points for anybody? No.

21:26.007 --> 21:39.164
There was the campus rumors were that if you wanted 
the best old quiz files to study for anything that

21:26.007 --> 21:39.164
the athletes had them. But there was in those days 
there was no indication that they had the quizzes

21:40.045 --> 21:50.358
before they were given or anything like that. And 
as far as you knew athletes went to class? Yes, and a

21:55.285 --> 22:11.601
lot of those, you know, I remember one of the 
football players was Larry Winkler from Temple

21:55.285 --> 22:11.601
area. He was in a lot of my classes, was just an 
ordinary person. In fact, he said that, you know,

22:16.266 --> 22:20.230
until he was small as a high schooler and gruesome 
after his senior year and I don't think he even had a

22:20.851 --> 22:42.218
scholarship when he came to A&M but he played his 
way onto the team and ended up with the scholarship

22:20.851 --> 22:42.218
and there were a lot of people like that there were 
uh I guess there were some some elitist type

22:43.885 --> 23:05.840
athletes that were just athletes, you know, 
especially, uh, when I was a freshman, uh, uh,

22:43.885 --> 23:05.840
there were two or three quite well-known running 
backs, uh, Smith, Robert Smith, and a few other

22:43.885 --> 23:05.840
people. But, but people like Yale Larry, you know, 
played his senior year played fullback some when

23:12.252 --> 23:40.909
Smith got hurt and you know weighed 150 pounds or 
something you know and you just think he couldn't

23:12.252 --> 23:40.909
do it and and that just you know gave everybody the 
impression that they were just uh just like

23:12.252 --> 23:40.909
everybody else were there any contemporaries of 
yours that have now gone on to world fame national

23:12.252 --> 23:40.909
fame

23:43.522 --> 23:47.527
Gotten rich, served in a certain office, been 
president of. I can't think of any of those people

23:50.131 --> 23:59.724
in my class that have exceeded, you know, in those 
kinds of, at those levels. Describe the A&M

24:00.505 --> 24:03.008
student body in general. Where were they from? 
What kinds of backgrounds? What kinds of

24:06.954 --> 24:08.656
attitudes? What kind of economic groups and so 
forth? Well, in those days there were, as I recall,

24:13.981 --> 24:22.337
there were almost 2,000 freshmen in 1951.

24:26.805 --> 24:36.023
There were quite a few from Houston and San Antonio 
and Dallas-Fort Worth, but Once you got past that

24:36.847 --> 24:42.094
point, most of them were from small towns. Most of 
them were from Texas. If they weren't from Texas,

24:44.417 --> 24:51.045
more than likely there was some family connection 
to A&M. And

24:51.466 --> 25:01.099
they were not so many that were from well-to-do 
families. So that was part of the explanation for

25:01.539 --> 25:05.284
there not being a, a large number of cars and they 
weren't all new cars by any stretch of the

25:05.669 --> 25:12.559
imagination. And I remember having a friend whose 
father owned an automobile agency, you know, and

25:13.160 --> 25:28.724
we all thought of him as being upper, you know, 
upper economic class. So that sort of, you know,

25:28.824 --> 25:34.933
illustrated that we were all from pretty far down 
the economic ladder. Did your family background

25:38.329 --> 25:45.716
really matter here among the student body? No, 
not, you know, that's one thing that they told us

25:47.518 --> 26:04.735
when we came was that you're going to be in a big 
fraternity and all you've got to, it doesn't

25:47.518 --> 26:04.735
matter what your family background is or how much 
money you have or you don't have, you're going to be

26:05.187 --> 26:08.572
judged on your performance. And we saw that with 
the Hispanic students. And there were quite a few

26:14.540 --> 26:16.523
in those days. And of all my regrets about the A&M 
traditions, one of them is that there weren't as

26:17.404 --> 26:28.300
many black students in those days. In other words, 
if A&M at that stage in the history of Texas and the

26:28.340 --> 26:34.148
South had had voluntarily admitted blacks at that 
time I think we'd have another thing to be proud of

26:34.718 --> 26:58.971
in our heritage but but our but the Hispanic 
students were accepted based on just the judgment

26:34.718 --> 26:58.971
that was passed on everybody else did they pull 
their share of the load, did they follow the rules,

26:59.626 --> 27:05.111
you know, all of those sorts of things. And true 
also for Jewish kids, was it? Yes. Jewish kids, I

27:09.396 --> 27:26.072
knew a few, and I remember one of my professors I 
learned was Jewish, and he was the first adult, you

27:09.396 --> 27:26.072
know, Jew, I suppose, that I'd ever known. And I 
remember that he was in the chemistry department,

27:26.491 --> 27:38.002
was an excellent teacher, and everybody had a 
good, you know, I never heard anyone say anything

27:26.491 --> 27:38.002
negative about him. And it didn't matter how much 
your family made or didn't make, it was how you were

27:38.883 --> 27:47.211
a part of the group, is that right? Yes. Did lots of 
students have nicknames then?

27:55.853 --> 27:56.915
Quite a few. Did you? No, I don't.

28:05.167 --> 28:07.089
I'm trying to remember about that. I

28:07.150 --> 28:19.127
did not have a nickname, but especially the 
students that that got into trouble quote unquote

28:19.546 --> 28:34.230
you know the ones that were always saying the wrong 
thing at the wrong time or something like that they

28:19.546 --> 28:34.230
would get a what they would call a handle and they 
they would have to introduce themselves as Fish I

28:34.632 --> 28:41.600
always mess up whenever I get excited, Jones is my 
name or something like that, you know. So, and

28:43.222 --> 28:50.851
sometimes those would be temporary and sometimes 
they'd be sort of permanent. Fortunately, I

28:53.254 --> 28:58.260
didn't get hung with one of those. Part of my 
strategy was to kind of keep a low profile and not

28:59.084 --> 29:07.458
get into all kinds of trouble. Among the student 
body, what were the most prestigious leadership

29:07.498 --> 29:14.570
positions on the entire campus? Well, we saw the 
core staff. as more visible and more important to

29:21.477 --> 29:33.494
the day-to-day student life than the student body 
president or who was not so important. I guess the

29:33.514 --> 29:45.770
non, the students that weren't in the core were 
mostly veterans, mostly totally here for

29:33.514 --> 29:45.770
academics, trying to graduate as quickly as 
possible. And so, And the core generated enough

29:50.148 --> 30:11.059
work for, you know, most everybody to have plenty 
to do and it wasn't until there was a significant

29:50.148 --> 30:11.059
part of the student body that wasn't in the core 
that there was a surplus of leadership to do the big

29:50.148 --> 30:11.059
MSC development and other things like that. So 
that was before the time of the student

30:20.573 --> 30:26.461
National Affairs, SCONA things, you know, all of 
that. What about the Yale leaders? Yale leaders

30:32.328 --> 30:34.691
were very visible. What did you all think of the 
band?

30:42.181 --> 30:49.450
Well, I can't remember ever having any

30:50.780 --> 31:11.590
anything but admiration for the band as a whole and 
some of people that were in transportation corps

30:50.780 --> 31:11.590
in our classes ROTC classes could be in the band and 
so they were all good friends

31:13.932 --> 31:16.382
I don't remember much else about it. The Corps 
always had these fierce competitions for

31:16.764 --> 31:24.516
marching and marching and who would win this and 
that.
