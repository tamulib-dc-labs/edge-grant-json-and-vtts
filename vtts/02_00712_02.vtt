00:04.233 --> 00:10.603
Dr. Thomas, would you tell us about some of the ways 
that you have gone about raising money for

00:04.233 --> 00:10.603
research endeavors?

00:14.709 --> 00:23.702
Well, now you're talking just generally about 
raising money for research, or are you talking

00:14.709 --> 00:23.702
about specifically for the center here? For the 
center here. For the center. Okay.

00:29.912 --> 00:33.497
Well, the... The main objective when you have a new 
organization such as this is and has been, you have

00:34.692 --> 00:44.523
to establish your credibility. And you have to get 
your name before those who sponsor work.

00:52.351 --> 01:04.024
And we were

00:52.351 --> 01:04.024
very fortunate in having early on a relationship 
with Professor John Erickson of the University of

00:52.351 --> 01:04.024
Edinburgh in Scotland, who is a, well, John is 
probably one of the Western world's foremost

01:04.477 --> 01:20.292
experts in the Soviet Union and Soviet military 
history. And, well, he is a Kremlinologist, as

01:20.332 --> 01:26.398
some of them are called. And so we were lucky in 
hooking up with him very early. John's fame in the

01:34.750 --> 01:43.623
U.S. and around the world brought us some degree of 
notoriety rather early on. In essence, we rode

01:45.346 --> 01:53.058
John's coattails into this new arena that Texas 
A&M had decided to try to enter. And then, in

01:54.320 --> 02:03.053
addition to that, it was a question of trying to 
identify problems that were of national or

02:03.303 --> 02:14.196
international interest and addressing those 
problems and showing people that, in fact, we

02:03.303 --> 02:14.196
could do work of this type. I think we've had some 
success in that.

02:21.926 --> 02:29.175
Of course, you have to understand that there is a 
certain amount of huckstering to this whole

02:21.926 --> 02:29.175
business.

02:30.708 --> 02:45.801
One of the problems that you have with a young 
professor, you say a young assistant professor

02:30.708 --> 02:45.801
who has just gotten his PhD, and he comes to Texas 
A&M, and he realizes that in order to get ahead

02:30.708 --> 02:45.801
here, why, you've got to learn to bring in money. 
What he doesn't realize is that the

02:47.263 --> 02:58.993
business of bringing money does not depend 
strictly on one's technical ability. A lot of

03:00.813 --> 03:16.276
these young fellows think that in order to get 
money that all they have to do is to write out a

03:00.813 --> 03:16.276
proposal, a technically excellent proposal, and 
send it off to the National Science Foundation or

03:00.813 --> 03:16.276
NASA or DOD and say send money by return mail. Well, 
it just doesn't happen that way. You have to sell

03:19.461 --> 03:20.763
yourself. You have to convince the sponsor that 
you're capable of doing good work and that you will

03:28.100 --> 03:29.442
that you'll do some good for him. Chances are he's a 
bureaucrat. He functions in that mode. He is

03:35.372 --> 03:43.184
judged by his effectiveness and by the impact of 
the money that he dispenses to others. Obviously,

03:43.945 --> 03:54.242
if a guy sits up there and gives money to people who 
don't perform, he's not going to have money to give

03:43.945 --> 03:54.242
to them very long. So the business of raising 
research is a combination of

03:54.982 --> 04:07.337
competence and marketing and huckstering and so 
forth. And some academicians recoil at that. They

04:10.561 --> 04:14.285
think, well, it just ought to be Simon Pure. And you 
ought to be judged strictly on your merits, your

04:14.446 --> 04:17.790
technical merits. And I suppose that would be nice 
if that's the way it was. But unfortunately,

04:21.394 --> 04:24.718
that's not the way it is. So we, the past two years 
then, I have spent an awful lot of time in

04:25.255 --> 04:48.767
Washington and other places, and

04:25.255 --> 04:48.767
just telling people about the Center, telling 
them about Texas A&M, because, you know, this

04:25.255 --> 04:48.767
Texas A&M has been, down over the years, a kind of a 
parochial university. It, of course, being a

04:49.948 --> 04:54.334
land-grant school, why it it felt responsive to 
the needs of the state. And so as a result, it has not

05:00.024 --> 05:09.499
been nationally involved for many years. And so 
the center here sort of represents one of Texas

05:10.741 --> 05:23.781
A&M's efforts to become nationally involved and 
internationally involved.

05:23.963 --> 05:33.891
But there was just an awful lot of people that had 
seen Texas A&M's football team on the field and had

05:23.963 --> 05:33.891
seen the Corps of Cadets and didn't really 
understand that, you know. I should say the

05:36.213 --> 05:41.078
marching band and the military aspects of the 
university. But just surprising how many of those

05:42.679 --> 05:53.228
folks needed to understand what Texas A&M was and 
what it was like and the fact that it is not just

05:42.679 --> 05:53.228
another pretty university. And so there's been a 
lot of that, and essentially just the business of

05:55.493 --> 06:04.746
establishing credibility and so forth. But it 
has, oh, I'm pleased with what we've accomplished

06:04.766 --> 06:16.562
to date, and I guess we'll get into that later, but 
we've still got quite a ways to go. What are some of

06:17.243 --> 06:21.949
the sources of funding that the research 
department has brought here? Well,

06:23.228 --> 06:37.683
the bulk of the funding from outside,

06:23.228 --> 06:37.683
well, I guess we need to back up now a little bit. And 
you need to understand the way the center has been

06:37.703 --> 06:45.230
structured for most of its existence. That is 
where we have had a series of groups within the

06:46.271 --> 06:52.037
center.

06:53.333 --> 07:00.563
Until

06:53.333 --> 07:00.563
prior to the first of June of this year, we had the 
Industrial Economics Group. It draws its funding

07:02.306 --> 07:10.778
largely from cities and other entities around 
over the state of Texas.

07:12.961 --> 07:21.012
So the city of Del Rio, for example, or let's see, I 
guess actually it was the COG, the Council of

07:12.961 --> 07:21.012
Governments around Del Rio, hired the industrial 
economics group back a year ago to do an industrial

07:21.650 --> 07:28.060
base study. And that means they go in there and they 
try to delineate all of the elements of the

07:29.201 --> 07:38.215
economic base for that region of the state. And of 
course, they were wondering what they could do to

07:39.637 --> 07:42.221
broaden that. And they were wondering 
specifically about how important an element of

07:42.361 --> 07:49.311
tourism was and how to beef that up. And so our 
people went in there and made the appropriate

07:50.000 --> 07:57.467
surveys and recommendations and presented that 
to the folks down there. So that funding came from

07:57.487 --> 08:03.874
the four or five county region around Del Rio. And 
they've done similar things for the city of Orange

08:05.475 --> 08:10.460
and the city of Big Spring and so forth. And if you 
interview John Roberts, who now heads the revised

08:10.520 --> 08:17.307
industrial economics division, a separate 
entity now, why he can tell you more about that.

08:22.694 --> 08:39.351
Then we have an urban group, which essentially 
tries to help city administrations around over

08:22.694 --> 08:39.351
the state, trying to increase the efficiency of 
the delivery of city government services to the

08:22.694 --> 08:39.351
citizens.

08:42.193 --> 08:44.055
Some of their funding comes from the cities. Some 
of it came from the National Science Foundation,

08:48.995 --> 08:56.845
which provided funding to set up something called 
the Texas Innovation Group, which is a group of

08:48.995 --> 08:56.845
around 40 cities that work together.

08:59.848 --> 09:07.498
Then we had this education group, and the bulk of 
their funding, their work deals largely with the

08:59.848 --> 09:07.498
CETA program. And so they have what we call 
pass-through money. It's federal money that

09:11.943 --> 09:17.550
comes from the, I guess, from the Office of 
Education, Department of Education, and comes to

09:18.290 --> 09:21.734
the governor, and then from the governor to us. And 
then we have a special studies group, and they were

09:23.376 --> 09:41.377
involved in hurricane response modeling, trying 
to, among other things, figure out how to evacuate

09:23.376 --> 09:41.377
Galveston Island in the teeth of a large 
hurricane. Now that money came partly from the

09:42.558 --> 09:46.643
state and partly from NOAA. the National Office of 
Atmospheric and National Oceanic and

09:47.602 --> 09:54.615
Atmospheric Administration. I'll get it right 
here shortly. And also we have a man here who is an

09:57.280 --> 10:08.361
expert in some of these exotic crops like Wai'uli 
and jojoba. Waiuli is a little shrub that grows

10:10.012 --> 10:16.783
wild in the Mexican desert and secretes latex. Can 
you spell that? G-U-Y-U-L-E, Waiuli.

10:23.634 --> 10:29.344
And we have a man here, Dan Bragg, who probably 
knows more about the economics of Waiuli than

10:23.634 --> 10:29.344
anybody else in the world. And there are those who 
think that that we need to make way more of a cash

10:34.126 --> 10:38.151
crop in the U.S. The Mexicans cultivated. They 
have a processing plant at Sotillo in Mexico. Can

10:43.978 --> 10:44.959
you spell that? Sotillo, S-A-L-T-I-L-L-O.

10:49.644 --> 10:56.893
And

10:49.644 --> 10:56.893
that money for Dan's work had come from the 
National Science Foundation. And, let's see,

10:58.575 --> 11:02.800
then in the defense group, which of course is the 
sort of really the main reason that the center

11:03.640 --> 11:06.724
exists. The bulk of that money comes from DOD. I 
should say not the bulk of it, all of it comes from

11:10.990 --> 11:15.356
DOD currently. And a large part of it from the 
Office of Net Assessments,

11:15.376 --> 11:25.530
which is part of the Office of Secretary of 
Defense. And then we now have a program that is

11:26.371 --> 11:32.161
being funded by the Defense Intelligence Agency. 
That's DIA, not CIA.

11:37.510 --> 11:50.151
And we've also done some work for the Foreign 
Technology Division at Wright-Patterson, which

11:37.510 --> 11:50.151
is the descendant of the old organization that I 
worked for up there, the Air Technical

11:37.510 --> 11:50.151
Intelligence Center. You mentioned earlier that 
some of the research work that the center does is

11:50.958 --> 12:07.427
unclassified

11:50.958 --> 12:07.427
because of the military sensiveness of the- It's 
classified because of the- Excuse me,

11:50.958 --> 12:07.427
classified. I have the wrong word. Is any of this 
information, can it be obtained through the

12:11.054 --> 12:15.582
Freedom of Information Act? I don't know enough 
about the legal ramifications of it. I would guess

12:22.198 --> 12:22.979
not. I know that there's a controversy underway in 
Congress now that a bill has been introduced to

12:23.239 --> 12:31.111
exempt the CIA from this Freedom of Information 
Act. Yes, uh-huh. Do you have any ideas on that?

12:34.697 --> 12:37.501
Yeah, I'm afraid I'll reveal some biases here. Of 
course, you know in the wake of Watergate and so

12:37.682 --> 12:45.754
forth, there was a some dismantling of our 
intelligence operations,

12:46.848 --> 12:56.423
a move that I think has gone far too far.

12:59.788 --> 13:12.788
And there was established this Freedom of 
Information Act which guaranteed access to

12:59.788 --> 13:12.788
certain classified or guarded material.

13:14.084 --> 13:21.415
And, of course, it established several oversight 
committees in Congress to look over the shoulder

13:14.084 --> 13:21.415
of CIA. That, by and large, has been a disaster 
because congressmen being the political

13:22.416 --> 13:37.037
animals, and senators, I don't mean just 
representatives, but being the political

13:22.416 --> 13:37.037
animals they are, they just can't keep their 
mouths shut.

13:38.013 --> 13:57.133
And we have, I think we have severely damaged the 
position and stature of the United States by

13:38.013 --> 13:57.133
dismantling essential parts of our intelligence 
apparatus and by permitting people to leak secret

13:38.013 --> 13:57.133
material.

13:59.715 --> 14:02.518
And it's been a sad operation. Now then, I would 
have to say that there very likely were excesses,

14:03.820 --> 14:27.548
abuses of that power that the CIA had and that the 
so-called imperial presidency had,

14:03.820 --> 14:27.548
but I worry less about that, frankly. I think I 
would rather see perhaps some modest abuse of

14:30.511 --> 14:39.742
power in contrast to a completely open situation. 
I just don't agree that the press has a right to know

14:40.122 --> 14:44.728
everything. And I think, you know, the pendulum 
swings and we'll find the correct position here

14:46.269 --> 14:57.703
eventually, but we're not there yet. Let me ask 
you, do you know in numbers about how many other

15:00.616 --> 15:09.588
universities have similar centers for strategic 
technology that Texas A&M has? Or is this a rare

15:09.608 --> 15:12.672
phenomenon, relatively rare? Well, it all 
depends on how rigidly or broadly you define the

15:12.692 --> 15:17.278
word similar. There are outfits that do Soviet 
Warsaw Pact research work. At Harvard there is an

15:27.346 --> 15:30.670
outfit called the Russian Research Center. 
Probably one of the better known organizations is

15:33.352 --> 15:39.679
the Hoover Institution, which is affiliated with 
Stanford University. The Mershon Center at Ohio

15:41.001 --> 15:42.783
State. Mershon, M-E-R-S-H-O-N Center at Ohio 
State is pretty well known.

15:55.443 --> 16:03.732
Center for Strategic Studies at Georgetown 
University in Washington is very well known. And

16:04.693 --> 16:13.983
there is a Center for International Studies, I 
guess they call it, in Florida. I think it's at the

16:15.064 --> 16:19.088
University of Florida at Gainesville, I believe, 
but I'm not sure about that. And so, yes, there are

16:19.726 --> 16:28.439
similar kinds of organizations that is similar in 
terms of the type of work that they do. Now, our

16:29.641 --> 16:36.130
philosophy, our operational philosophy, 
however, is rather different than those. So this

16:37.272 --> 16:41.939
is where I get in the business of being a little bit 
more specific about the word similar.

16:45.224 --> 16:47.607
One of the reasons that the Center exists is that we 
had been encouraged by some fairly high-ranking

16:48.397 --> 16:55.826
military officers to get into this game. And what 
they were telling us was that some of the existing

16:57.469 --> 17:15.872
think tanks, and there are those who refer to us as 
the Aggie think tank, and I guess that's to some

16:57.469 --> 17:15.872
extent true, but some of the existing, that most of 
the existing think tanks had had gotten caught up

17:17.422 --> 17:20.285
in the Washington scene. There are two large ones 
which are not affiliated with universities, the

17:22.807 --> 17:33.418
RAND Corporation, R-A-N-D, and of course, the 
Brookings Institute in Washington. They've been

17:33.438 --> 17:40.585
in this business a long time, as well as these other 
university things. But what we were told was that

17:41.546 --> 17:47.412
they have been in the business so long, and they 
have become so much a part of the Washington scene

17:48.910 --> 17:50.652
that they'd begun to feed on one another. And I know 
from my experience when I was at the University of

17:51.894 --> 18:01.327
Maryland and being in the Washington area that 
these people all attend the same cocktail

17:51.894 --> 18:01.327
parties. They attend the same briefings. And, 
well, as a result, there's just no fresh thinking

18:04.872 --> 18:09.158
that comes out of them. And so this was one of the 
things that we were told very clearly, that the

18:10.539 --> 18:18.310
nation needed a new boy on the block. to do some 
fresh thinking, and somebody that was not a part of

18:19.606 --> 18:24.331
the Washington scene. And we sure as the deuce 
qualify on that basis.

18:30.137 --> 18:45.994
Beyond that, one very high-ranking military 
officer told me, he said, you know, Dick, he said,

18:30.137 --> 18:45.994
he said our track record in terms of predicting and 
evaluating Soviet actions and intentions has not

18:30.137 --> 18:45.994
been good. And And one of the main reasons for that 
is the so-called mirror image syndrome, which is a

18:49.981 --> 19:13.933
view that the Soviet Union sees the world the way we 
do, a view that believes that they respond to

18:49.981 --> 19:13.933
pressures the way we would, that they want the same 
things in the world that we do, and that's just flat

18:49.981 --> 19:13.933
wrong. They think differently. They act 
differently. They believe differently. And a lot

19:21.658 --> 19:35.172
of our erroneous assessments of the USSR has 
derived from that mirror image syndrome. And I had

19:36.473 --> 19:45.722
had a brush with that when I was at ATIC way back 
before I went back to do my graduate I can tell you

19:46.327 --> 19:47.408
more about that. It involves some classified 
stuff, but I can give you an unclassified

19:48.189 --> 19:54.696
description of it. But from the beginning then, my 
view has been that we were not going to fall into

19:54.716 --> 20:02.784
that trap. That we were, to the extent that we 
could, we were going to learn how to think Soviet.

20:09.871 --> 20:14.376
In other words, when an issue or a problem came up, 
we're going to try to try to think about it the way

20:14.761 --> 20:16.683
the Soviets would. And this is a rather different 
viewpoint than any of these other institutions

20:18.285 --> 20:24.833
have. Yeah, I notice you have a Soviet map on the 
wall behind you here, so that's to give you that

20:24.853 --> 20:30.280
perspective. That's right. That's right. And

20:33.724 --> 20:43.215
Professor Erickson at the University of 
Edinburgh, who I mentioned earlier, has been very

20:33.724 --> 20:43.215
important in this because course John you know 
he's a brilliant man speaks six languages

20:44.073 --> 21:12.139
including Russian fluently travels in Russia 
extensively and his view is that it doesn't make

20:44.073 --> 21:12.139
any difference whether you're talking about 
Afghanistan or you're talking about space

20:44.073 --> 21:12.139
warfare or you're talking about Poland or or what 
that the in order to understand

21:12.372 --> 21:15.755
the way the Russians operate, you have to 
understand the Soviet psyche. And I regret to say

21:17.717 --> 21:20.860
we have not spent a lot of time doing that. We spent a 
lot of money studying the accuracy of their

21:20.940 --> 21:34.853
missiles, and we can tell you how accurate they 
are, and we can tell you how fast their airplanes

21:20.940 --> 21:34.853
fly, and we can tell you how thick the armament is on 
their, the armor plating is on their tanks, and so

21:20.940 --> 21:34.853
forth. But when you come to study the Soviet 
military man, the guy who pulls the trigger or

21:40.790 --> 21:55.165
pushes the button or gives the order or the people 
that back him up, we really don't understand a

21:40.790 --> 21:55.165
great deal about the Soviet Union. And so that's 
one of the underlying philosophies that we have

21:55.185 --> 22:06.797
here, that we're going to make our studies, every 
one that we do, just as broad as we possibly can. And

22:08.144 --> 22:16.355
so one of the messages that I carried to people who 
would sponsor our work was that philosophy. And I

22:16.375 --> 22:32.037
had to tell them, if you give us money to study, say, 
Soviet moves toward space warfare capability,

22:16.375 --> 22:32.037
we're not going to limit it just to the 
technological studies. We're going to try to

22:32.097 --> 22:35.502
understand the people that make the decisions 
that undergird that whole effort? And where are

22:38.681 --> 22:45.271
the research institutes that supply that 
technology? How do Brezhnev and the Politburo

22:45.291 --> 22:49.637
feel about that? What sort of policy views do they 
have? What are the decision-making processes

22:53.582 --> 22:59.951
that underlie all of that? And so we tackle things 
rather broadly here. uh then there was another

23:06.785 --> 23:34.007
another element to this thing too i mentioned to 
you that that there were some high-ranking people

23:06.785 --> 23:34.007
and and also i i've talked about the military but 
but we had well i have a former student who's on the

23:06.785 --> 23:34.007
staff of the senate armed services committee he's 
an a m graduate and of course he uh he works now for

23:06.785 --> 23:34.007
senator tower and and uh And he has some very strong 
views, and he's in a unique position to observe a

23:34.460 --> 23:43.312
lot of this stuff. And from him and from others, 
even military people, they

23:43.452 --> 23:57.531
admitted that they had been part of the problem 
here. That is to say that in the past, an outfit

24:04.278 --> 24:10.646
would come to the military in Washington to get 
money to do a piece of research work. And this, more

24:12.749 --> 24:15.413
often than not, was not a university outfit. It 
would be typically one of what we call the Beltway

24:15.453 --> 24:27.308
Bandits, which is the array of little 
organizations, R&D organizations, that dot the

24:15.453 --> 24:27.308
Beltway around. What was that word? Beltway 
Bandits, they called them. And they're outfits

24:31.126 --> 24:38.496
who sell their services to the Pentagon and to 
other agencies in Washington. Well, if one of

24:38.516 --> 25:00.087
these outfits came to the Pentagon and got a chunk 
of money,

24:38.516 --> 25:00.087
in the process of negotiating the contract and 
talking about the work, the Pentagon, the

24:38.516 --> 25:00.087
military officers would tell the outfit, in 
essence, what they thought the answer would be

24:38.516 --> 25:00.087
when they completed this research. More often 
than not, lo and behold, that was in fact the answer

25:03.047 --> 25:07.032
that showed up.

25:12.078 --> 25:15.863
And I don't know that there was anything 
necessarily malicious about this. It was just

25:15.963 --> 25:17.825
something that happened. And so there was a crying 
need for objectivity in a lot of these studies. and

25:27.404 --> 25:31.991
a crying need for an organization that would 
simply call a spade a spade. And if you came up with

25:32.552 --> 25:41.385
an answer that was somewhat different than what 
the sponsor thought it was going to be, well,

25:32.552 --> 25:41.385
that's the way it was. In short, it was hoped that we 
could avoid a position where we might be judged to

25:43.829 --> 25:56.247
be intellectual prostitutes, more or less.

25:57.155 --> 26:05.186
So there was one other element to this thing that I 
might mention that deals with your comment about

25:57.155 --> 26:05.186
classified material.

26:08.471 --> 26:20.648
I know when I was in this game first, way back years 
ago,

26:08.471 --> 26:20.648
there was an awful lot of open literature stuff 
that is unclassified material that came across my

26:08.471 --> 26:20.648
desk. But being young and impressionable, Of 
course, I saw top secret stuff, too, and stuff that

26:25.606 --> 26:30.152
was classified beyond that. And I thought that the 
top secret stuff was a hell of a lot more valuable

26:31.594 --> 26:39.185
than the open stuff. The open literature just 
wasn't worth anything because it was open. Well,

26:44.552 --> 26:46.115
that's wrong. That's an erroneous view. And of 
course, the Russians now publish and disseminate

26:48.217 --> 26:55.107
an awful lot of literature about themselves. and 
so one of the things that again this was to some

26:56.521 --> 27:19.153
extent the Erickson influence on us Erickson 
works only with open literature and and he knows an

26:56.521 --> 27:19.153
awful lot about what is going on in Russia and he 
understands of course an awful lot about the

26:56.521 --> 27:19.153
Soviets and so Another of our operational 
philosophies here is that we will mine the open

27:20.247 --> 27:26.715
literature assiduously. And yeah, we'll do 
classified work, but we don't necessarily think

27:27.637 --> 27:37.249
that the answers are all in classified documents. 
And so we do, the bulk of our work to date has been

27:37.269 --> 27:45.981
unclassified open literature searches. Could 
you touch briefly on Maybe some study that's being

27:48.850 --> 27:53.315
undergone now or has recently been completed.

27:56.078 --> 27:58.922
Yeah, we can give you two or three examples. That'd 
be sufficient, thank you. Okay. First of all,

28:02.286 --> 28:16.562
the Pentagon has asked us here to, this was an 
offshoot of the Erickson program,

28:16.964 --> 28:23.634
set up a so-called program of excellence for the 
study of Soviet military organizations and

28:16.964 --> 28:23.634
personnel. And the first study that was 
undertaken in that program was a study of Soviet

28:25.977 --> 28:33.929
military districts. The Soviet Union is divided 
up into about 16 military districts.

28:43.143 --> 28:44.625
They are unique. organizational entities. 
There's nothing else like it anyplace else in the

28:46.850 --> 28:49.894
world. Well, I take that back. I guess the Chinese 
have military districts, but they are relatively

28:51.576 --> 29:00.527
recent developments.

29:03.931 --> 29:14.123
However, the military districts in the Soviet 
Union existed back in czarist times.

29:15.250 --> 29:34.429
They represent

29:15.250 --> 29:34.429
an effort on the part of the Soviet military to 
bring the military right down to grassroots

29:15.250 --> 29:34.429
control and grassroots involvement throughout 
the USSR. We don't really understand how they

29:35.971 --> 29:42.878
function, especially in wartime.

29:43.837 --> 30:07.701
and you have to understand that the invasion of 
afghanistan was not done by the soviet army it was

29:43.837 --> 30:07.701
done by the two adjoining military districts the 
turkestan military district and the central

29:43.837 --> 30:07.701
asian military district and so they now i don't 
mean to infer that they are autonomous in some

29:43.837 --> 30:07.701
areas they are you see military training in the 
soviet union starts in the second grade And the

30:09.520 --> 30:18.794
local military districts have the 
responsibility for that training program for

30:09.520 --> 30:18.794
Soviet school children. In that sort of a 
function, they are relatively autonomous. But I

30:23.080 --> 30:32.094
surely don't mean to infer that the two commanders 
of the military districts got together and said,

30:23.080 --> 30:32.094
hey, let's invade Afghanistan. No, that's not 
yet. They are linked directly to the Ministry of

30:35.609 --> 30:42.958
Defense in Moscow, and the Ministry of Defense 
calls the shots. But an awful lot of the logistics

30:43.078 --> 30:53.711
and the rear services and supply and a fair amount 
of the troop supply come from the military

30:43.078 --> 30:53.711
districts. So it's a kind of a unique and odd 
organizational entity. And so our study here was

31:00.179 --> 31:05.565
to try to understand how those military districts 
function uh what they uh what they do what they

31:06.625 --> 31:35.046
don't do how much how much autonomy do they have and 
they are disparate in their in their

31:06.625 --> 31:35.046
organizational structure some of them are quite 
complex others are fairly simple some of them will

31:06.625 --> 31:35.046
have civil defense responsibilities some of them 
do not so it's kind of an odd odd quirk so we are just

31:06.625 --> 31:35.046
now in the final stages of actually what will turn 
out to be a first part of a two-stage study of Soviet

31:35.262 --> 31:44.170
military districts. We had thought initially it 
would just be one element, which would be largely

31:44.230 --> 31:51.577
historical.

31:54.179 --> 32:03.227
However, the second element, which we will do next 
year, will deal with what we call the military

31:54.179 --> 32:03.227
districts in the mobilized mode, which will look 
at what in fact has happened to those two military

32:03.933 --> 32:08.277
districts adjoining Afghanistan. There had also 
been some movements involving the military

32:09.298 --> 32:16.465
districts adjoining Poland. And so perhaps from 
that we can glean some information on how those

32:16.705 --> 32:25.094
things function during wartime. And so that's one 
study that

32:26.475 --> 32:33.822
will be completed shortly. We have a series of 
so-called casual papers which deal with Soviet

32:34.898 --> 32:48.475
command structure, command changes, and the 
personalities involved. The idea here is, again,

32:48.495 --> 32:53.302
it's just a business of trying to learn how the 
Soviets think. When a commander changes his...

33:01.223 --> 33:06.591
his position, that is, when he's given a new 
command or moves within the military structure.

33:08.093 --> 33:30.606
We'll go back and get information on his 
background, where he was born, where he went to

33:08.093 --> 33:30.606
school, what kind of military schools did he go 
through, if we can find it, what were his parents

33:08.093 --> 33:30.606
like, and try to get some idea of his background and 
his training.

33:31.075 --> 33:37.101
And then we'll have a complete review of the 
military posts that he has been assigned to. And

33:37.121 --> 33:52.355
then we will, if we can find three or four papers 
that he has authored over the past, say, ten years

33:37.121 --> 33:52.355
in military journals or whatever, we'll 
synopsize those papers. But when you put that all

33:53.016 --> 33:59.682
together, it makes a fascinating package, 
because here is this guy. Oh, we recently did one on

34:00.151 --> 34:02.254
General Majorov. And

34:02.955 --> 34:09.445
here's this guy sort of laid out before you. And so 
you can see his background and his training. And

34:15.815 --> 34:29.415
then when you look at some of his recent writings, 
which are synopsized, you get some idea of what

34:15.815 --> 34:29.415
he's thinking about and what his main concerns 
are. And these generally will establish some sort

34:30.172 --> 34:36.160
of a pattern. And so it can be fairly revealing. So 
we've published, I guess, three or four studies of

34:37.903 --> 34:42.509
that type.

34:45.674 --> 34:54.747
Then a study that is just now being published 
switches over to the US side.

34:56.089 --> 34:59.233
There are about 10 materials. which are labeled 
strategic. These are metals which are very

35:02.642 --> 35:07.949
important to the U.S. military. Cobalt is one of 
them. When you add cobalt to steel, it makes it very

35:12.175 --> 35:14.858
hard. It also increases its magnetic properties 
and increases its high temperature

35:15.399 --> 35:26.554
characteristics, which means that it's very 
useful for turbine engines and things like that.

35:27.817 --> 35:33.604
It's also very useful in electronic components 
because of its magnetic enhancement

35:27.817 --> 35:33.604
capabilities. Currently the U.S. gets, 
depending on what year you look at, anywhere from

35:34.966 --> 35:46.901
75 to 95 percent of its cobalt from Zaire in Central 
Africa, Southern Africa. And there's a whole

35:47.162 --> 35:50.466
array of these things, tantalum, titanium, And a 
lot of people think that oil is the only material

35:52.268 --> 35:58.837
where we are at the mercy of other people. That's 
wrong.

36:03.183 --> 36:18.023
So we've done a study of

36:03.183 --> 36:18.023
looking at what the U.S. might do in the event of a 
protracted conflict with the Soviets.

36:19.066 --> 36:30.301
There is more and more thinking now that when war 
comes, that it will not be a nuclear war, that it

36:19.066 --> 36:30.301
will be a protracted non-nuclear war. And so the 
question is, the U.S. military needs cobalt in

36:30.641 --> 36:46.002
sufficient amount to build jet engines and other 
war materiel. for the duration of that

36:46.758 --> 36:50.023
non-nuclear war. And if the Soviets could choke 
off our supply from South Africa, from Southern

36:51.344 --> 37:06.946
Africa, I should say, which they could fairly 
easily do, then where in the name of God do we get the

36:51.344 --> 37:06.946
cobalt? And so the title of the study is Cobalt, 
Strategic Alternatives for Supply. And there are

37:14.990 --> 37:19.215
four alternatives for supplying cobalt. And I 
won't take time here to delineate all of that. But

37:23.199 --> 37:27.504
what it amounts to is that there is cobalt here in 
the U.S. and Canada. There had been cobalt mines

37:28.324 --> 37:32.389
here, usually associated with copper mines. But 
because of the economics of the situation, it was

37:33.510 --> 37:38.335
cheaper to buy it from Zaire and ship it in here. And 
so all of our cobalt mines have been shut down,

37:38.515 --> 37:42.279
copper mines. So we need to reopen them. It turns 
out that the country that has more cobalt than any

37:45.668 --> 37:52.475
other country in the world is Cuba. Well, in the 
event of a protracted non-nuclear conflict with

37:54.757 --> 38:03.646
the Soviets, are we going to permit them to operate 
from that base there 90 miles from our shore? One

38:05.307 --> 38:06.168
would think not. One would hope not. I'm not 
espousing an invasion of Cuba, necessarily, on

38:08.791 --> 38:12.975
the other hand. I think to try to pretend that Cuban 
cobalt does not exist is stupid. And so one of our

38:19.599 --> 38:36.079
recommendations that came out of this report was a 
suggestion that in our strategic planning that we

38:19.599 --> 38:36.079
take into account the fact that Cuba does have 
those magnificent cobalt reserves and plan

38:19.599 --> 38:36.079
accordingly. Were these reserves being unused at 
this time? Oh, yes. The Soviets are using them. You

38:40.064 --> 38:40.465
bet. They get 40% of their cobalt from Cuba. And, of 
course, using plants that were originally

38:44.967 --> 38:49.671
American-built in pre-Castro days. And then 
after Castro took over, of course, they were

38:50.832 --> 38:57.538
nationalized in an organization called, set up 
called, Cubanico. And it's an arm of the Cuban

38:58.719 --> 39:01.401
government. And so they sell, as a matter of fact, 
that's one of the main elements of the Cuban

39:01.421 --> 39:08.787
economy, that and sugar, cobalt and sugar. And so 
it... It's a situation that I think has to be looked

39:15.764 --> 39:20.489
at realistically. I might add that in this report, 
in this study that we did, we made an estimate of the

39:22.050 --> 39:28.837
amount of cobalt that the U.S. would need. And of 
course, the U.S. has been stockpiling cobalt and

39:30.018 --> 39:37.144
has about 40 million pounds of cobalt in our 
stockpile currently. Our estimates indicate

39:39.166 --> 39:45.012
that that would be about adequate for the first 
year of a conflict. Which would be all right. I

39:46.288 --> 39:47.230
mean, that's great. That gives us a year or two to do 
some other things. The question is, what are the

39:50.755 --> 39:52.658
other things you're going to do? And so I think if we 
could reopen US mines with more efficient

39:53.920 --> 40:06.559
extraction processes, then perhaps be prepared 
to use the Cuban nickel somewhere or other. And

40:06.659 --> 40:12.568
those strategies are beyond my consideration. I 
think all we can do is just simply point out that

40:13.122 --> 40:17.107
it's there and it needs to be considered. And it's 
amazing. I've previewed this report before some

40:19.350 --> 40:22.334
people in Congress. They said, Cuba? Nickel? Why 
didn't somebody tell us? And so this is, I think,

40:27.361 --> 40:35.913
another evidence of the kind of fresh thinking 
that is needed in some of these areas.

40:38.696 --> 40:41.340
There are some other things that we'll be getting 
into. Later on, we, of course, here at Texas A&M, we

40:41.692 --> 40:51.104
are very strong in the energy field, particularly 
in natural gas, crude oil production, that sort of

40:41.692 --> 40:51.104
thing. We're also very strong in manufacturing, 
and manufacturing is undergoing a revolution now

40:52.126 --> 41:02.019
with computer-aided systems coming into the 
scene. And so we will be doing some of those kinds of

41:03.221 --> 41:11.091
studies in the Warsaw Pact and in the USSR. And then 
there is one other program that will begin this

41:12.320 --> 41:20.491
fall, which will deal with space warfare. And 
there is some very clear evidence that the Soviets

41:21.893 --> 41:30.285
are moving heavily in this direction with the 
development of laser and particle beam weapons.

41:31.286 --> 41:36.353
As a matter of fact, they are, according to the 
evidence, they are probably ahead of the U.S. in

41:31.286 --> 41:36.353
that area. So we've been asked by the US Air Force to 
make a study of some aspects of the US space program

41:36.839 --> 41:59.726
and try to give some recommendations as to what 
kinds of new technologies need to be developed in

41:36.839 --> 41:59.726
order to allow the US to fight and win a war in space. 
OK, in closing, is there any other comment that

42:01.207 --> 42:06.053
you'd like to make about anything regarding the 
center your activities? Oh, I guess only this. As I

42:11.369 --> 42:19.438
said earlier in the interview, the Center here 
represents a new effort for Texas A&M. It

42:19.498 --> 42:31.112
represents a new frontier, a new way in which Texas 
A&M can serve the people of the state of Texas and

42:19.498 --> 42:31.112
the people of the United States. I think, and of 
course it's a biased view, I think Texas A&M's star

42:31.379 --> 42:36.527
is rising. I think with all due respects to our 
friends in Austin, I think Texas A&M is becoming

42:36.907 --> 42:47.483
the premier institution in the Southwest. And so I 
think the center can help contribute to that image

42:49.125 --> 42:56.115
and to that structure. And also, I would hope the 
Center can do something else. You know, there are,

43:04.790 --> 43:16.827
of course, many influences on the federal scene, 
and many of us feel that the influence of the

43:04.790 --> 43:16.827
Northeast and the Midwest has exceeded their 
importance in the general scheme of things. It

43:18.169 --> 43:29.685
seems like when anybody is appointed to a high post 
in the government, why, he comes from MIT or

43:18.169 --> 43:29.685
Caltech or someplace. And that's not to say that we 
want Texas or the Southwest to run everything,

43:30.509 --> 43:35.916
necessarily. On the other hand, we think that 
there needs to be more of a balanced voice in some of

43:36.717 --> 43:46.971
these national decision-making processes. And 
so I think there is a role here for the center to

43:48.133 --> 43:51.697
play. Of course, here again, I'm not suggesting 
that we don't have good representation in

43:52.218 --> 43:59.588
Congress or anything like that. we do have. On the 
other hand, one cannot lose people like LBJ and

44:01.965 --> 44:11.760
Connolly and Olin Teague and Sam Rayburn and so 
forth without losing a hell of a lot of clout. You

44:12.261 --> 44:17.589
know, our young people are bright and articulate 
and so forth, but they just don't have the clout

44:12.261 --> 44:17.589
that those old boys had. And so, here again, I think 
that an outfit like the Center can contribute to

44:17.609 --> 44:27.263
that, and Texas A&M, of course, has as its first 
mission the education of young people in the state

44:27.800 --> 44:37.914
of Texas, and that must remain the first objective 
for this institution. But close behind that, I

44:39.135 --> 44:53.014
think, has to be a program to serve the people of the 
state of Texas and, indeed, the people of the

44:39.135 --> 44:53.014
United States in other ways, and in ways that a 
truly intellectual institution can. And so I

44:54.344 --> 44:58.269
think the center can aid in that. And so we have 
fairly lofty goals. But you know how Aggies are.

45:06.399 --> 45:08.161
We'll just swat the hell out of things. And it 
doesn't make any difference whether this is a

45:08.321 --> 45:13.047
lofty goal or not. We're going to give it our best 
shot, and we're going to win. Thank you very much

45:16.932 --> 45:20.577
for this most enlightening interview, Dr. 
Thomas. Thank you.
