WEBVTT

00:02.630 --> 00:28.654
was the most frustrating or oh lord i'll tell you uh 
probably quite frankly the most frustrating time

00:02.630 --> 00:28.654
for me was and and it's worked it worked out fine six 
months afterwards but worth nellin and i had lots

00:02.630 --> 00:28.654
of differences of opinion

00:02.630 --> 00:28.654
uh my you know i have uh I submitted a proposal, a Sea 
Grant research proposal to him, or to the Sea Grant

00:31.553 --> 00:42.482
program, and he was looking at my publications.

00:44.984 --> 00:54.873
And this was about the time that I was coming up for 
tenure, too, although I didn't really think very

00:44.984 --> 00:54.873
much about it. I didn't feel pressure about tenure 
and that sort of thing. If I got it, I was going to get

00:57.896 --> 00:59.737
it. If I didn't, I didn't. But Worth and Allen 
called me on the phone one day and he said, I was

01:01.642 --> 01:13.076
looking at your CV. Most of your publications are 
not more than five or ten pages in length. Is that

01:20.525 --> 01:21.867
usual in your area?

01:24.590 --> 01:29.877
And I said, well, they're refereed and, yeah. He 
said, I guess they're refereed, but said, five or

01:30.886 --> 01:35.271
ten badges just aren't very many. That doesn't 
seem to me like that would have very much material

01:36.372 --> 01:45.962
in it, very much science in it. And he really, you 
know, he's really browbeating me over that. And I

01:52.068 --> 01:57.113
finally, I happen to have a copy of science on my, on 
my desk at the time, and I told him that Watson and

01:58.730 --> 02:08.503
Crick had a, I saw a publication of Watson and Crick 
in Science, and I believe it was three pages long.

02:09.952 --> 02:14.377
He said, well, I'm just going to have to think about 
this project. He said, you guys have been floating

02:14.397 --> 02:24.209
this research in veterinary medicine for a long 
time, and I'm just going to have to see if I want to

02:14.397 --> 02:24.209
support this anymore. Then he hung up, and I was 
really worried about that. I had my salary. on

02:32.362 --> 02:37.990
that, but it was salary, you know, if I didn't get 
the project, I would still be paid. But I didn't

02:38.010 --> 02:38.731
know that. I was naive. I didn't know that my salary 
was covered, whether I got that money or not. That

02:45.521 --> 02:49.126
was kind of a difficult time. But throughout all of 
them, throughout every instance where I had

02:49.167 --> 02:58.420
anxieties, Leland and the people supported me. 
All right, and to whom do you feel, what senior

02:58.535 --> 03:09.828
people do, can be administrators or colleagues, 
to what senior people do you feel now looking back,

02:58.535 --> 03:09.828
do you feel the most gratitude? Oh, Leland 
Grumbles. Leland Grumbles. Any others? Oh, yes.

03:18.518 --> 03:19.720
Well, several people. One person who was here for a 
short period of time, only a short period of time, I

03:20.481 --> 03:26.027
think he got fired, Bob Abel. That's A-B-E-L, 
isn't it? I believe that's right. And Perry

03:34.332 --> 03:37.656
Atkinson was a good friend. Now, he was a 
controversial person. Neville Clark was a good

03:42.241 --> 03:43.642
friend. If I had to rank them, you know, I'm not sure 
how I would rank them. Neville Clark is,

03:49.489 --> 03:56.217
he has really been a good friend. And of the deans, 
which ones would you put in the highest category?

04:02.306 --> 04:05.849
I'd put Al Price higher, I surely would. George 
Shelton was a nice guy, one that was supportive and

04:08.212 --> 04:15.320
would relate to. Shattuck, I was always 
suspicious of. I didn't have any major problems

04:20.145 --> 04:26.592
with him, but

04:27.820 --> 04:34.829
He was,

04:27.820 --> 04:34.829
me personally, I didn't have any problems with 
him, but a lot of people did. And a lot of people

04:36.111 --> 04:38.434
weren't unhappy to see him go. What's the general 
sentiment about Richard Adams as dean? About like

04:44.282 --> 04:45.664
they are for shouting.

04:48.688 --> 04:50.470
Let's see.

04:52.171 --> 04:53.133
You got near the end. For you and family, what kind 
of social activities did the Veterinary Medicine

04:54.254 --> 05:04.450
faculty have through the years? That's a strange 
one. See, we were kind of unique. And there used to

05:08.016 --> 05:12.663
be this Veterinary Wives program. And of course, I 
wasn't a veterinarian. And on a few of the first

05:15.968 --> 05:19.073
meetings, that point was made very clear that 
whether they tried to vote whether they were going

05:19.492 --> 05:26.842
to have Carol involved in those since I wasn't a 
veterinarian. Well, I'm not sure they knew that

05:26.862 --> 05:28.625
you were. They were just saying, you know, 
non-veterinary. Well, that may be. That may be.

05:33.652 --> 05:35.314
But they were saying something to it. But one 
faculty member said, I don't think we're just

05:35.374 --> 05:41.924
going to have coffee and we're going to enjoy each 
other's fellowship. This business of veterinary

05:41.944 --> 05:46.790
faculty shouldn't, veterinary or 
non-veterinary shouldn't make any difference.

05:47.632 --> 05:49.214
And so that's, I think that's the way that it is. But 
No, we really... Were there family

05:52.156 --> 05:53.780
get-togethers? Oh, there were family 
get-togethers. There's a story on this, too. I

05:59.531 --> 06:02.316
don't know whether Donald would want me to repeat 
this or not. Probably not. But I'm going to do it

06:03.979 --> 06:05.703
anyway. We always had at least an annual picnic. 
And it was usually in one of the parks around here.

06:13.053 --> 06:14.815
in the college park over there. I don't know the 
name of it now, but anyway, we were all meeting

06:16.157 --> 06:25.188
there, and Donald had just kind of become a toilet 
dream. Hmm? No, it's John. One of them, anyway. And

06:30.755 --> 06:37.243
so he was so proud of the fact that he could urinate 
without having to, you know, having to have a

06:30.755 --> 06:37.243
diaper or anything. So I was visiting with Al 
Price, And he came up there and showed that he was

06:40.711 --> 06:48.421
able to urinate without having to have his diaper 
changed. And so he just pulled it out and peed right

06:48.541 --> 06:56.091
there. And during these 30 years, have the social 
activities of veterinary faculty, families,

07:05.517 --> 07:06.278
Continued? No. That's what I was fearful the 
answer would be. No. There are a few of them who

07:10.002 --> 07:12.064
still get together. But there's nothing in 
general. Well, it's become such a large faculty.

07:20.513 --> 07:27.160
In fact, many of the faculty, I mean, I don't even 
know all the people that are faculty there now. And

07:28.281 --> 07:34.748
who have been your family's closest veterinary 
friends? Our families' closets better? Well, for

07:37.118 --> 07:37.739
you. I'm talking about you and... Me and Carol. 
Yeah. In general, okay. Well, there's one group

07:44.950 --> 07:47.514
that we little leagued with. I mean, the Brattons 
and the...

07:52.823 --> 07:56.749
I'm sure I'm leasing tonight, but the Adams. We did 
sport things together with, and then there's Uh,

08:02.926 --> 08:04.988
there are very few. I didn't do but wives very much. 
I'm not the, much of the, I'm not very supportive.

08:11.495 --> 08:19.242
And then you had, uh, uh, you know, we had some, uh, 
in the area, neighborhood. Mm-hmm. We did. And

08:21.204 --> 08:25.549
then you've had some people who were very 
supportive, particularly when you had the

08:21.204 --> 08:25.549
accident. Oh, yeah. And, and when we, I tell you, 
when, I don't know if y'all were here when, when we

08:26.870 --> 08:32.055
lost a child or not. No, I don't think so. But boy, we 
lost one child in 1970. And boy, the support of the

08:38.801 --> 08:45.649
church and the veterinary faculty, I mean, that 
was just really something.

08:53.519 --> 08:57.143
I think everything now is less personal than it 
used to be. Oh, definitely. At every institution

08:57.664 --> 08:59.506
and so forth. It's definitely that way out there. 
Well, let's see. I'm near the end. What topics have

09:03.986 --> 09:06.690
we not touched that we should have? Can you think of 
anything that we should have included? There's

09:11.817 --> 09:14.421
probably one anecdote I should give you. Oh, 
please do. Ian Desard was going to be the new

09:15.422 --> 09:23.954
department head, and so he came over to visit us. 
And at that time, we had an aquarium up there, and we

09:24.034 --> 09:31.084
had a cat.

09:33.730 --> 09:36.573
that we didn't know, but it had some neurologic 
problems. We didn't know it at the time. And so we'd

09:38.916 --> 09:49.989
invited Ian and his wife to come over and we were 
having

09:38.916 --> 09:49.989
coffee and so forth over there in that area. We had a 
different booth. And here the new department head

09:52.812 --> 10:01.442
was coming in and we were supposed to be kind of 
entertaining them. and this cat hops up there to

10:02.587 --> 10:30.990
the thing sees the fish swimming in there reaches 
in to get the to get the fish first hops up on the

10:02.587 --> 10:30.990
aquarium and then reaches in to get the fish and 
wasn't wasn't sufficiently coordinated and fell

10:02.587 --> 10:30.990
in the aquarium

10:02.587 --> 10:30.990
we're talking about what a 50 gallon yeah and there 
was in in and And they looked at that and, you know,

10:31.797 --> 10:35.864
then we all just laughed about that. And it was the 
children's goldfish. Oh, yeah, yeah. And nothing

10:39.731 --> 10:43.517
fancy.

10:44.058 --> 10:45.761
What other topics have we not included? Well, 
let's see. I've got two more questions that I can

10:49.868 --> 10:55.257
think of.

10:56.941 --> 11:00.226
I think, you know, I can't think of anything. 
Social life, we've, you know, we've had a good

11:00.827 --> 11:06.756
social life, but we've been sort of isolated.

11:10.122 --> 11:12.385
All right, then the next last question then. Let's 
make believe that someone walked up to you and gave

11:12.786 --> 11:23.623
you a check for a million dollars that you must pass 
on to Texas A&M, but you get to decide the use of the

11:12.786 --> 11:23.623
money. What would you have A&M do? If you could make 
a major gift to A&M, what would you want that gift

11:26.937 --> 11:31.347
used for? I would want it to be used in enhancing 
distance education because I think that that's, I

11:31.828 --> 11:43.755
think we're going to more and more going to have to 
use. develop a system, and it may have to be

11:44.225 --> 11:58.985
something like a movie production system, but I 
think that the education, the lecture mode is

11:44.225 --> 11:58.985
going to be there for a long time, but I think we're 
going to have to more and more. All right, then the

12:00.528 --> 12:06.436
last question is, what feelings do you carry in 
your heart for Texas A&M today? Oh, great. It's

12:08.438 --> 12:13.185
been a nurturing, I mean, I've been very fortunate 
to the gift of friends and fellowship in this

12:13.739 --> 12:29.470
community and in this this environment it's just 
been for a person I don't deserve the kind of things

12:13.739 --> 12:29.470
that I've gotten at A&M. It's just been, you know, I 
should still be working in the gyp mill and being

12:31.059 --> 12:43.061
happy with, you know, making wall board and maybe 
having a, you know, being able to go fishing on

12:31.059 --> 12:43.061
weekends and that sort of thing. But my, you know, 
it's just been great.
