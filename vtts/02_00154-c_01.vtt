00:02.191 --> 00:17.065
This is Sunday

00:02.191 --> 00:17.065
morning, May 7, a bright, clear day.

00:21.069 --> 00:29.177
And I'm heading toward Kerrville for an interview 
with Porter Garner, Jr., who for many years

00:30.254 --> 00:35.181
operated the Cadillac bar in Laredo. He is now 
retired and I'm going to interview him this

00:35.202 --> 00:48.081
afternoon and then go to a meeting of the Schreiner 
College Board of Directors tomorrow in

00:35.202 --> 00:48.081
Kerrville.

00:53.690 --> 00:58.557
This is an effort to try to begin to record some of my 
memories Of service here at Texas A&M.

01:06.294 --> 01:09.257
Which began in the fall of 1959. My

01:09.577 --> 01:20.066
parents. We're both. What they identified as 
quote farm kids.

01:29.074 --> 01:30.535
From near Garland. Texas.

01:34.458 --> 01:46.314
When they were born, dad in 1909 and mother in 1910, 
that was a little farming community about 20 miles

01:34.458 --> 01:46.314
northeast of Dallas. And the money crop for 
everyone was cotton.

01:53.343 --> 01:57.028
They were both from what they identified as

01:59.624 --> 02:03.449
hard working farm families. They

02:03.509 --> 02:16.224
married in 1930 and I was born then a year later in 
1931.

02:22.532 --> 02:26.897
Dad became a construction carpenter when the war 
started.

02:29.864 --> 02:49.345
He got a job with the construction crew that 
created Shepherd Air Force Base up in Wichita

02:29.864 --> 02:49.345
Falls, S-H-E-P-P-A-R-D.

02:29.864 --> 02:49.345
And we moved up there in June of 1941. We

02:49.485 --> 02:56.513
were there until about Halloween and then

02:59.227 --> 03:11.764
went to Fort Smith, Arkansas, where he had the same 
task at what we called Camp Chaffee,

02:59.227 --> 03:11.764
C-H-A-F-F-E-E, an army base.

03:15.630 --> 03:24.762
After a lot of flooding and what we thought was cold 
weather, he heard about better pay down at

03:26.058 --> 03:32.704
shipyard in Orange, Texas, the extreme 
southeastern corner of the state. We headed down

03:32.724 --> 03:55.643
there,

03:32.724 --> 03:55.643
and he was hired as a shipwright,

03:32.724 --> 03:55.643
S-H-I-P-W-R-I-G-H-T,

03:32.724 --> 03:55.643
which we soon learned meant someone who did 
woodwork in relation to

03:56.315 --> 04:00.620
ships.

04:04.545 --> 04:07.288
The pay there was $1.12 and a half cents an hour. And 
since he had been making 25 cents an hour on

04:08.730 --> 04:22.727
construction in the Garland area less than two 
years earlier, we thought that gold had been

04:08.730 --> 04:22.727
discovered.

04:26.015 --> 04:55.414
We lived first in a little

04:26.015 --> 04:55.414
two-room apartment out toward

04:26.015 --> 04:55.414
what we called the Port Arthur Bridge, a very high 
rainbow-shaped structure across the Natchez

04:26.015 --> 04:55.414
River, N-A-C-H-E-S,

04:26.015 --> 04:55.414
until near the end of the spring semester.

04:57.757 --> 05:19.787
I was a sixth grader and had entered a 
four-teacher, eight-grade school in January

04:57.757 --> 05:19.787
1942, the day the school district changed from the 
Prairie View Common School District to the Bridge

04:57.757 --> 05:19.787
City Independent District.

05:19.807 --> 05:27.477
Late that spring,

05:19.807 --> 05:27.477
mother and dad bought a 29-foot house trailer and 
were able to park it in the backyard of a nice

05:29.093 --> 05:53.582
family, A.C. Griffith, Abby, and Freda, 
F-R-E-D-A-B-B-E-Y,

05:29.093 --> 05:53.582
F-R-E-D-A, Abby and Freda Griffith, at 15, uh-uh.

05:59.047 --> 06:18.737
the southeast corner of Green and Main Street of 
16th

05:59.047 --> 06:18.737
and Main Street in Orange.

06:21.962 --> 06:24.666
I finished the year at Bridge City. And then early 
that summer, mother came back from the wash

06:26.266 --> 06:55.665
interior one day saying that she had learned that 
there was a rich man in Orange named Lutcher Stark

06:26.266 --> 06:55.665
who

06:26.266 --> 06:55.665
paid for almost all of the expenses of the high 
school boys band, the Bengal Lancers. and the

06:56.354 --> 06:59.117
girls drum and bugle corps, the Bengal Guards. He 
bought the instruments, the music, the uniforms,

07:01.600 --> 07:19.200
paid the travel expenses, and even underwrote 
salary for the band director, a man named Frank

07:01.600 --> 07:19.200
W.R. Hubert. In order to be in the band, you had to 
get permission of Mr. Huber. So mother took me over

07:26.601 --> 07:30.347
to visit with him very soon. And he quickly asked 
what instrument I wanted to play. I told him

07:41.626 --> 07:50.661
trumpet because I was a fan of Harry James, who'd 
grown up not far west in Beaumont, not far west of

07:41.626 --> 07:50.661
Orange. He quickly asked to see. For me to. Show him 
that gap in my upper teeth. Smiled and said. That

08:04.543 --> 08:10.330
trumpet would not work, but I needed to be a 
clarinet player. So I began practicing then. And

08:15.095 --> 08:19.680
as school started that fall, I got to March with. 
The Bengal anchors. which other than me

08:24.290 --> 08:36.907
was made up of some really fine musicians and we 
became a really good marching group.

08:41.694 --> 08:53.149
We lived in that trailer

08:41.694 --> 08:53.149
where there were couches at each end that unfolded 
into

08:41.694 --> 08:53.149
double width It

08:53.939 --> 09:13.879
had a sink and an electric refrigerator, but we 
went into the back porch of the Griffiths' house

08:53.939 --> 09:13.879
for restroom and bathing facilities. Orange was 
in the midst of going from 7,000 to about 40,000

09:21.563 --> 09:28.692
population in 18 months because of the boom of 
three shipyards. Dad was working at a

09:29.673 --> 09:50.018
consolidated shipyard,

09:29.673 --> 09:50.018
a big operation, which built destroyers, for 
instance, DDs, destroyer escorts, for instance,

09:29.673 --> 09:50.018
DEs, and landing craft infantry, LCIs.

09:59.056 --> 10:12.698
The classes at the high school building, a 
structure designed for four grades and 500

09:59.056 --> 10:12.698
students.

10:15.944 --> 10:16.765
But Having to accommodate six grades and almost 
3,000 students were really hectic. There were

10:28.768 --> 10:40.261
classes in the hallway and the school cafeteria 
and everyone had to stand in line to go to the

10:28.768 --> 10:40.261
restroom. Yet we had some splendid teachers and 
everything seemed orderly. In hindsight, it is

10:49.195 --> 11:11.018
astonishing how crime-free that boomtown was as 
we listened at the news from Europe and the Pacific

10:49.195 --> 11:11.018
in what seemed to us to be some very tough years, 
some very tough months.

11:21.646 --> 11:49.392
After perhaps two years in the trailer house, we 
were able to move to

11:21.646 --> 11:49.392
the Riverside Edition, a newly created 
government housing project

11:21.646 --> 11:49.392
northeast of the older part of Orange, which was 
created out of a swamp.

11:52.274 --> 12:21.825
The

11:52.274 --> 12:21.825
construction of Riverside had come about when 
engineers went in and cut down the cypress trees in

11:52.274 --> 12:21.825
the swamp, quickly pumped sand out of the Sabine 
River, and then put prefab housing on that

11:52.274 --> 12:21.825
location to accommodate perhaps 10,000 
residents.

12:24.387 --> 12:31.734
It was big enough that there were three elementary 
schools just to serve Riverside.

12:31.754 --> 12:44.347
By the fall of 1943, the new high school for Urange 
had opened

12:31.754 --> 12:44.347
just east of what had been the old high school. The 
new high school named in honor of Mr. Stark, Stark

12:46.669 --> 12:53.196
High School. with Tigers as the traditional

12:55.133 --> 13:06.074
mascot name and orange and black the school 
colors. The old high school building became Helen

13:08.619 --> 13:16.635
Carr Junior High in honor of the longtime high 
school principal.

13:19.838 --> 13:29.487
But still, the Bengal Guards and Lancers included 
students from both institutions.

13:29.507 --> 13:44.322
During those years, we had quickly joined the 
First Presbyterian Church there and once more

13:29.507 --> 13:44.322
encountered the generosity of the Stark family.

13:47.545 --> 13:48.026
H.J. Lutcher Stark's mother, had financed the 
construction of the splendid

13:51.293 --> 14:07.576
pink granite building for the First Presbyterian 
Church down at 8th and Green Avenue.

14:11.562 --> 14:20.895
It was built in the first decade of the century at a 
very high cost for that era. and included some

14:21.753 --> 14:30.348
prize winning windows, stained glass windows 
that she had bought at the Chicago World's Fair.

14:34.034 --> 14:47.136
Even at church, some of us played in a little band 
and we learned that Mr. Stark's idea for the Bengal

14:34.034 --> 14:47.136
Guards and Lancers had started with the band that a 
little musical organization that he had helped

14:47.993 --> 14:59.644
underwrite in the mid-1930s.

15:07.931 --> 15:08.792
The Reverend E.T. Drake was the longtime minister 
at the church. Having started his ministry there

15:19.060 --> 15:28.855
as a student, a palestine student at the Austin 
Presbyterian Seminary. It was the only

15:30.718 --> 15:35.785
congregation he ever served and he did so with 
great dignity. Another distinction of that

15:36.987 --> 15:44.258
building is that it was the first air-conditioned 
building west of the Mississippi and perhaps the

15:36.987 --> 15:44.258
first in the world. The Stark family, once more, 
the Stark family had

15:45.436 --> 16:03.164
underwritten the construction of an ice making 
plant in a building just north of the church

15:45.436 --> 16:03.164
sanctuary. Then fans blew air over the blocks of 
ice through a duct system into the church

16:04.205 --> 16:12.338
building.

16:16.165 --> 16:30.722
Life in that boomtown

16:16.165 --> 16:30.722
was hectic,

16:16.165 --> 16:30.722
was calm, but always in high gear. The shipyard 
went

16:30.742 --> 16:45.278
for many months, worked three shifts,

16:30.742 --> 16:45.278
and included a lot of overtime.

16:47.992 --> 16:56.683
The launchings of the destroyers in particular 
were major times of major celebration.

17:01.769 --> 17:15.906
And we proudly listened to victory on the radio 
from the

17:01.769 --> 17:15.906
European and Pacific theaters. Particularly, I 
remember D-Day, June 6, 1944. We were driving up to

17:26.655 --> 17:30.559
Garland to visit family. I kept the radio on almost 
all the trip in the car.

17:40.031 --> 17:45.437
And then my grandmother Jackson, mother's 
mother, my maternal grandmother Jackson,

17:47.290 --> 18:08.130
allowed me to sleep on a pallet in the living room of 
her farmhouse, and put the radio right down by my

17:47.290 --> 18:08.130
pallet, and I listened about almost all night to 
reports of the victory the Americans were

17:47.290 --> 18:08.130
attaining.

18:08.150 --> 18:17.078
Back at school, as I moved forward into grades, I 
became active in a number of organizations,

18:19.285 --> 18:47.672
In hindsight,

18:19.285 --> 18:47.672
it is clear that one of the key teachers that 
blessed me was Myrta Mae Force, M-Y-R-T-A, M-A-E,

18:19.285 --> 18:47.672
two words, Myrta Mae Force,

18:19.285 --> 18:47.672
a first-year teacher that all of us thought was 
strikingly beautiful, who had just graduated

18:19.285 --> 18:47.672
from LSU. She organized a group of us into what she 
called a debating club.

19:00.573 --> 19:12.276
And we quite often gathered on Saturdays to go 
picnic

19:00.573 --> 19:12.276
and to learn more about public speaking and 
debating.

19:16.728 --> 19:36.952
In retrospect, it is clear that what she was really 
doing was giving a few of us, perhaps a dozen,

19:16.728 --> 19:36.952
encouragement in public speaking

19:16.728 --> 19:36.952
and organization of our thoughts.

19:40.436 --> 19:46.583
She helped this country boy, this small town boy, 
to believe that he had capability.

19:53.489 --> 20:04.020
She also was a ceaseless encourager

19:53.489 --> 20:04.020
of hard work and high grades.

20:09.727 --> 20:18.156
That paragraph, that encouragement put her back 
in the category of two other teachers who had

20:19.925 --> 20:28.574
already been very important in my development.

20:28.594 --> 20:43.350
The first of these was Miss Faye Strange, third 
grade

20:28.594 --> 20:43.350
instructor in Garland, with prematurely white 
hair, Because she had prematurely white hair, we

20:45.777 --> 20:57.915
students thought that she must have been very 
aged.

20:57.935 --> 21:11.295
In hindsight,

20:57.935 --> 21:11.295
it is now clear that she was in her 30s,

20:57.935 --> 21:11.295
but she took this

21:14.785 --> 21:41.502
this hesitant

21:14.785 --> 21:41.502
country boy who

21:14.785 --> 21:41.502
had never,

21:14.785 --> 21:41.502
who had not been aware of any encouragement from 
anyone other than family before Miss Strange

21:14.785 --> 21:41.502
became his teacher.

21:45.970 --> 22:03.139
She gave me hope that I could do well, and my grades 
improved

21:45.970 --> 22:03.139
sharply. And she made a lifelong impression

22:04.001 --> 22:11.033
on my effort.

22:14.084 --> 22:30.227
I will always be grateful that I had the 
opportunity at my parents 50th wedding

22:14.084 --> 22:30.227
anniversary to thank her in person

22:14.084 --> 22:30.227
for her contribution at that celebration.

22:33.171 --> 22:41.323
And then not long before her death

22:33.171 --> 22:41.323
in early in the year 2000.

22:50.667 --> 23:02.805
I wrote her

22:50.667 --> 23:02.805
in

22:50.667 --> 23:02.805
an effort to put on paper my heartfelt feelings. 
Paragraph a second teacher who was important in

23:15.323 --> 23:24.457
The development of intellectual confidence and 
talent was fourth-grader Mrs. Grace Glaze,

23:15.323 --> 23:24.457
G-L-E-Z-E. Her husband was then the high school 
principal in Garland, and Mrs. Glaze had an

23:26.299 --> 23:42.023
unceasing determination to encourage everyone 
to do their best. One of her favorite techniques

23:43.842 --> 23:49.308
was a series of competitions. Spelling bee, 
writing, essays, themes, mathematics, travel.

24:00.680 --> 24:10.390
In hindsight, it seems that she was trying to do 
everything she could to give every student an

24:00.680 --> 24:10.390
opportunity to be a winner. I particularly 
remember that with the youngster named Jesse

24:12.698 --> 24:20.109
Cathy, C-A-T-H-E-Y. Jesse's family was truly and 
pitifully poor.

24:32.446 --> 24:39.516
Apparently, his clothes were not washed very 
often, nor did he bathe regularly.

24:43.158 --> 24:59.373
He lacked polish and confidence, but the one thing 
he could do well

24:43.158 --> 24:59.373
was to write letters. That was his handwriting. It 
was very, very

25:03.056 --> 25:11.764
attractive. almost as if he had had penmanship 
classes. And so our writing contest quite often

25:16.688 --> 25:32.917
resulted in Jesse being the winner.

25:32.937 --> 25:37.245
And there was his moment of glory. For me, the great 
victory of that year in Mrs. Glaze's class was when

25:39.098 --> 25:56.355
the year's spelling bee ended, I was at the head of 
the line. When you missed a day and your turn came,

25:56.375 --> 26:09.088
you then moved to the foot of the line when you 
returned. I had been at the head of the line but then

26:10.722 --> 26:27.433
my parents and I took our first vacation ever to go 
to visit some of mother's relatives in Tennessee

26:10.722 --> 26:27.433
during the Easter break in 1941.

26:30.599 --> 26:31.701
The only days Only days of construction I missed, 
the first four years of school, except when I had

26:32.508 --> 26:43.561
the chicken pox soon after Christmas in the second 
grade.

26:47.225 --> 27:00.321
But anyway, but still, when I came back, was able to 
work to the head of the line, and when the year was

26:47.225 --> 27:00.321
over, I was first in place, and that gave me as a 
trophy, for being the, quote, champion speller. A

27:06.573 --> 27:30.003
scrapbook filled with letters to Uncle Wiggly, to 
Uncle, or was it Uncle Ben,

27:06.573 --> 27:30.003
who wrote a column in the Weekly Reader, a 
publication aimed at elementary schools

27:06.573 --> 27:30.003
nationally.

27:30.023 --> 27:31.084
But back to Orange.

27:36.616 --> 27:48.012
Even

27:36.616 --> 27:48.012
in junior high, I began to take courses that might 
lead me toward college.

27:52.298 --> 28:00.009
Never could I remember

27:52.298 --> 28:00.009
feeling that I would have any choice but to go to 
college. Although neither parent had finished

28:02.472 --> 28:05.256
high school, Dad dropping out in the 9th grade.

28:11.796 --> 28:15.020
To to take a job quote on the square in Garland.

28:18.123 --> 28:23.129
That employment with Cole and Davis, COLE and 
Davis. The primary. Quote quote dry goods store.

28:32.399 --> 28:35.563
Quote in Garland ended during the Depression. 
When they had to lay off everyone except family.

28:42.092 --> 28:43.314
Mother had dropped out. Had mother had had to drop 
out of school. Early in the 11th grade. Because of

28:52.706 --> 28:55.310
her mother's arthritis.

28:58.914 --> 29:02.559
Her mother's rheumatism and she had to help take 
care of her. And. As the middle child of 11

29:05.125 --> 29:16.681
children, mother then had to accept a number of 
almost parental responsibilities.

29:18.984 --> 29:31.842
Because of those experiences, they always spoke 
to me with the phrase, quote, when you go to

29:18.984 --> 29:31.842
college, period, quote. I did not feel I had a 
choice

29:33.340 --> 29:50.263
and did not question, but that their 
determination for me was a blessing.

29:50.284 --> 30:02.200
