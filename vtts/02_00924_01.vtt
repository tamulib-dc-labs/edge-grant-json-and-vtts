00:01.246 --> 00:01.607
1986. This is Ed Hamlin here in El Paso, Texas, 
beginning an interview with Robert Parsons. He

00:13.310 --> 00:20.564
spent some years with the city planning agency in 
El Paso prior to John Cunningham becoming the

00:13.310 --> 00:20.564
director. Bob, how are you? Just fine. I actually 
went to work for the city of El Paso August 22, 1949,

00:25.023 --> 00:36.194
which is kind of prehistoric before Ed Hammond was 
born. That's true, that's true. But at the time

00:38.676 --> 00:54.912
that I went to work for the city, there had actually 
been one full-time person in the Department of

00:38.676 --> 00:54.912
Planning, a gentleman by the name of Walter E. 
Stockwell, who was involved in the preparation of

00:55.803 --> 01:00.449
the original Kessler city plan in certain 
capacities. His name appears in the report. How

01:03.552 --> 01:04.814
long had he been planning director? From about the 
time that the Kessler plan was adopted, which was

01:06.276 --> 01:20.973
quite a few years ago, he became the first planning 
director for the city. Actually, city planning

01:20.994 --> 01:23.076
engineer was his title. Shortly before I went to 
work for the city, two gentlemen were hired by a

01:24.642 --> 01:36.394
progressive mayor who thought that the city 
needed more than just one person to head its

01:24.642 --> 01:36.394
planning department. And the first two were V.L. 
Mike Mahoney, who came from Tucson and who was

01:39.256 --> 01:51.088
associated with Tucson planning department and 
later on was at Austin, and then from there on I kind

01:39.256 --> 01:51.088
of lost track of him. He was a very accomplished, 
studious-type fellow who accomplished in the

01:52.233 --> 01:59.639
area of planning. Along with him was William S. 
Bonner, who was with the Department of Planning in

02:00.580 --> 02:10.909
El Paso up until he went to University of Arkansas 
in Fayetteville.

02:13.471 --> 02:16.354
So together, those two people and the director 
constituted the department. That was the

02:16.374 --> 02:18.335
department. Along about the first part of 1950, 
independently and individually those two moved

02:22.658 --> 02:47.923
on to greener pastures and that was when i 
transferred into the department of planning

02:22.658 --> 02:47.923
working with mr stockwell from where i had been 
hired which was the department of public

02:22.658 --> 02:47.923
inspection of course i had an architectural 
background that sort of thing so it was kind of a

02:22.658 --> 02:47.923
natural gravitation and i worked with mr 
stockwell and performed all the functions of

02:48.933 --> 03:06.976
preparing material and undertaking studies for 
the City Planning Commission and the Board of

02:48.933 --> 03:06.976
Adjustment, City Council, such things as that, 
for several years before I went into the Air Force

02:48.933 --> 03:06.976
in 1952.

03:09.760 --> 03:16.408
I was involved in such lovely things as 
condemnation studies,

03:17.924 --> 03:22.973
off-street parking, surveys, you know, the usual 
things you would expect to get into. But with a

03:23.814 --> 03:36.316
small apartment, really two people, three 
people, we hired another person, you got to do

03:23.814 --> 03:36.316
everything, obviously, a little bit of 
everything. Had to do a lot of original-type

03:37.278 --> 03:40.303
stuff. comprehensive plan, or the plan that was 
originally adopted by the city, the Kessler plan,

03:40.486 --> 03:47.436
had that been updated during this period? No. 
Really, that was why Mike Mahoney and Bill Bonner

03:49.058 --> 03:58.531
were hired, to update the plan, which essentially 
had just been sitting there dormant for those many

03:49.058 --> 03:58.531
years. They got into some of the earlier work on it, 
did part of the work, and then of course they moved

04:00.814 --> 04:09.767
on before it was really really updated. Portions 
of it were facelifted, about the best way you could

04:10.981 --> 04:15.745
say it. But the city did have zoning authority at 
that time. Yes. In fact, zoning was practically

04:20.669 --> 04:27.295
the most of the plan that the city was following. 
That was essentially it. Describe El Paso during

04:32.279 --> 04:34.822
this period. The post-war period was a period when 
we saw a lot of growth. from the adoption of the

04:39.633 --> 04:44.779
Kessler Plan up until that time, we hadn't seen the 
kind of growth we've seen since then. Describe how

04:45.539 --> 04:50.805
the city was composed and comprised, whether it 
had, in fact, outgrown the Kessler Plan or not.

04:51.686 --> 05:05.421
Actually, the population of the city did not 
increase during the Kessler Plan, after the

04:51.686 --> 05:05.421
Kessler Plan was adopted, but in fact declined. 
And this was partly because of the Depression and

05:07.156 --> 05:15.348
the economic conditions, and it was partly 
because of other circumstances. It wasn't

05:15.989 --> 05:23.701
actually until after the war, or during the war, 
that the population came on back and drills began.

05:23.721 --> 05:29.689
Of course, there was little subdivision activity 
and not an awful lot of development because of the

05:23.721 --> 05:29.689
war, during the war years. But along about 49, 
well, from the late 40s on, That's when the

05:36.316 --> 05:48.671
activity really began in the city, and it moved 
from a population of about 100,000 to a population

05:36.316 --> 05:48.671
of about 130,000 in the post-war years. It had an 
area of about 25 square miles at that time, and much

05:49.912 --> 05:58.442
of the area within the city limit was undeveloped. 
And if you

06:00.044 --> 06:05.631
relate it to The city as it is now, along about 
Reynolds Avenue, was the end of the eastern growth

06:05.830 --> 06:18.928
of the city, which, of course, extends beyond that 
now probably, what, six or seven miles, seven or

06:05.830 --> 06:18.928
eight miles. The Kessler plan as such didn't 
provide, it didn't really constitute a

06:18.948 --> 06:26.098
comprehensive plan as we'd consider it today. And 
it specifically didn't provide a great deal of

06:26.979 --> 06:34.369
guidance in terms of land use and future arterials 
in the outlying areas. Would you agree with that or

06:36.227 --> 06:38.951
not? It certainly was rather stylized at the time, 
but it did provide broad brushstrokes, things

06:38.971 --> 07:01.543
such as a park planning, a river walk, the 
McKelligan Canyon Park, a tunnel through the

06:38.971 --> 07:01.543
mountain, major thoroughfares planned. A lot of 
the elements of the city plan were incorporated in

07:03.239 --> 07:19.516
it, the unfortunate part was that very little of 
the plan was implemented during the period from

07:03.239 --> 07:19.516
when it was prepared and presented to the city up 
until it really became obsolescent. I'm

07:21.438 --> 07:26.344
overstating this, but that's essentially it. The 
plan was followed to a fair degree, but not uh

07:34.255 --> 08:02.997
didn't always have the kind of support it should 
have had and certainly wasn't updated period on it

07:34.255 --> 08:02.997
a major function of the planning department since 
i've been aware of it has been the cartography

07:34.255 --> 08:02.997
section the preparation of base maps and 
preparation official city zoning maps and such

07:34.255 --> 08:02.997
what uh what kind of map documents existed at the 
time when you were with departments and how what

07:34.255 --> 08:02.997
role did the department have in the preparation of 
those maps Practically none. The city

08:05.819 --> 08:14.251
engineering department prepared maps and had the 
only cartography section that there really was.

08:15.433 --> 08:31.077
The Department of Planning was principally, the 
personnel were engaged in planning more or less

08:15.433 --> 08:31.077
activities

08:15.433 --> 08:31.077
rather than the preparation of maps and this sort 
of thing. did the planned commission provide more

08:32.187 --> 09:00.135
direction than perhaps it does today and on 
planning matters planned commission at that time

08:32.187 --> 09:00.135
consisted of five people who were rather than 
another large commission that we have now and it

08:32.187 --> 09:00.135
wasn't an attempt to represent a cross-section of 
every facet of the community it was selected of the

08:32.187 --> 09:00.135
prominent responsible intelligent people who 
knew how to work together and wanted to work

09:01.786 --> 09:15.886
together on building a better community. These 
people were not representing particular

09:15.946 --> 09:25.279
segments of the community, but they looked at 
themselves as representing the community as a

09:15.946 --> 09:25.279
whole. and thought of the community as a whole in 
their activities that sounds like a bit of a

09:25.799 --> 09:48.769
contrast with some of the commissions we've had at 
least within my memory we have had a lot of growth in

09:25.799 --> 09:48.769
the city and during a period when we had at-large 
membership of the at-large elections of city

09:25.799 --> 09:48.769
council members frequently we found a lot of 
members of the city plan commission were I mean, I

09:49.441 --> 09:53.064
think it's a good question. I think it's a good 
question. I think it's a good question. I think

09:56.027 --> 09:57.809
it's a good question. I think it's a good question. 
I think it's a good question. I think it's a good

10:01.773 --> 10:03.134
question. I think it's a good question. I think 
it's a good question. I think it's a good question.

10:12.903 --> 10:14.164
I think it's a good question. I think it's a good 
question. uh knowledgeable in real estate but

10:19.310 --> 10:45.874
they were not earning their living from real 
estate or development the board of adjustment had

10:19.310 --> 10:45.874
realtors on it and people in the development area 
to give relief from the provisions of zoning

10:19.310 --> 10:45.874
ordinance but the planning commission took a 
little bit broader view with a little bit that the

10:46.377 --> 10:55.868
leaders on the commission were looking at above 
and beyond the dollar sign, shall we say. Today,

10:55.888 --> 11:04.759
the zoning board of adjustment, the staff 
assistance for the zoning board of adjustment is

10:55.888 --> 11:04.759
provided by the public inspection department. 
What was the relationship between city planning

11:04.779 --> 11:09.825
and the zoning board of adjustment when you were 
with the department? The department of planning

11:09.925 --> 11:15.912
provided the technical assistance to the board of 
adjustment. The public inspection department

11:16.955 --> 11:22.621
was not involved in it. This was thought that, 
well, if there was some question of construction

11:22.641 --> 11:32.190
that entered into it or something with the 
building code, they were invited in as guests. But

11:32.911 --> 11:46.084
basically, the thinking at that time was that if 
there were flaws in the zoning ordinance that

11:32.911 --> 11:46.084
needed to be addressed, the staff would be able to 
receive frequent requests for relief from

11:46.452 --> 12:02.066
evasions of the ordinance and could address the 
questions of the flaws more easily by dealing

11:46.452 --> 12:02.066
directly with it. In other words, the commission 
did its thing, and then the Board of Adjustment did

12:02.126 --> 12:09.713
its thing, and the department provided the tie 
between. How about in code enforcement of zoning

12:10.473 --> 12:14.417
provisions? Essentially, the building 
department enforced the zoning ordinance. Was

12:20.583 --> 12:25.570
there a good relationship between the planning 
department and the zoning and the billing

12:20.583 --> 12:25.570
official for that purpose? Generally, yes. Of 
course, the department provided technical

12:26.812 --> 12:31.880
assistance to the building official. There was a 
feeling, probably not openly stated, that their

12:32.741 --> 12:43.678
job really was enforcement of the building code 
rather than the zoning ordinance. And it was

12:44.249 --> 12:54.604
looked upon perhaps as a little bit on the orphan 
side, but there was good cooperation between the

12:44.249 --> 12:54.604
two sections. During the period when you were with 
the department, were any of the ordinances

12:54.624 --> 13:01.754
changed, the zoning ordinance and the 
subdivision ordinance in particular? At that

13:04.017 --> 13:08.223
time, there was not a subdivision ordinance as 
such. It was subdivision regulations. But as far

13:12.093 --> 13:14.996
as the zoning ordinance was concerned, oh, yes. 
During that period of time, the first provisions

13:15.336 --> 13:39.923
for off-street parking and architectural 
control in certain zones and all the little

13:15.336 --> 13:39.923
refinements from the original zoning ordinance 
were constantly being incorporated and updated

13:15.336 --> 13:39.923
to meet the contemporary standards. I'm 
interested in that from the standpoint the early

13:40.308 --> 13:57.849
plan documents, the Kessler plan and such, 
provided no specific guidelines with regard to

13:40.308 --> 13:57.849
provisions which are commonly incorporated in 
zoning ordinances, and yet it necessarily

13:40.308 --> 13:57.849
involves planning work, not necessarily 
comprehensive planning. The determination of

13:58.470 --> 14:08.982
what is an appropriate setback and what is the 
appropriate density within a given zoning

13:58.470 --> 14:08.982
district, perhaps you could describe some of the 
thinking at the time. that might have generated

14:09.434 --> 14:36.015
changes in the zoning ordinance well the regional 
zoning ordinance was prepared generally in

14:09.434 --> 14:36.015
accordance with the direction that was indicated 
in the city plan and it remained substantially

14:09.434 --> 14:36.015
intact during the 30s and then the first 
substantial updates were in the late late 30s and

14:36.367 --> 14:51.424
And

14:36.367 --> 14:51.424
would these changes then be described as perhaps 
acknowledging more contemporary styles of

14:36.367 --> 14:51.424
development? For instance, in the post-war era, 
the tract housing became increasingly common,

14:51.444 --> 15:02.897
and were you aware of changes that were made 
specifically to accommodate that kind of

14:51.444 --> 15:02.897
development? The only thing that comes to mind 
were requirements for off-street parking. And

15:10.535 --> 15:32.057
there were some changes made to the ordinance in 
the form of new districts in residential areas and

15:10.535 --> 15:32.057
apartment areas, which were more restrictive to 
reflect garden apartment type development. to

15:32.543 --> 15:46.455
provide for wider side yards in a higher-grade 
residential than the old A Zone, so-called, which

15:32.543 --> 15:46.455
called for a fifty-foot lot and five-foot side 
yards. There was a double A Zone that was created,

15:46.495 --> 15:53.601
which is larger lots and wider side yards and so on. 
For the protection of the residences that were

15:53.621 --> 15:57.605
more significant in size. Right. In your area, 
that was the the first change that occurred in

16:01.417 --> 16:03.720
tract development. And, of course, the garden 
apartment type concept came in, and this also

16:03.740 --> 16:18.316
required more flexible use of land in the 
preparation of one- and two-story apartments,

16:03.740 --> 16:18.316
low density. You mentioned parking standards 
were incorporated. What existed prior to the

16:21.439 --> 16:26.445
thinking during that era in the way of parking 
standards? The standard in El Paso was a 50-foot

16:26.965 --> 16:39.562
lot, as I mentioned, with a street in front and an 
alley in back and usually a detached garage

16:26.965 --> 16:39.562
opening in off of the alley. With the post-war 
subdivision, the first thing that was limited, of

16:40.723 --> 16:48.353
course, in El Paso was the alley. Streets were 
reduced in width. Lots were increased in width and

16:53.039 --> 16:56.584
reduced slightly in depth. And consequently, the 
only access was from the front. And the first

17:04.688 --> 17:27.128
problems that we perceived in a growing 
community, growing family size and this sort of

17:04.688 --> 17:27.128
thing, was the single garage or the parking space 
that was provided on the site was often the first to

17:04.688 --> 17:27.128
go in order to accomplish a slightly increased 
residents take care of new children, this sort of

17:28.407 --> 17:33.034
thing. Filling in the garage. Right. And so we 
perceived that we were going to have to preserve

17:35.337 --> 17:47.815
off-street parking in some fashion on the site, or 
else enter into a period of chaos in your

17:35.337 --> 17:47.815
developing areas, which we did. How about in 
commercial districts, the parking standards?

17:51.520 --> 17:54.124
What existed prior to that? Essentially nothing. 
And this was left to the good development ideas of

17:56.183 --> 18:08.019
those making or constructing buildings in 
commercial areas.

18:11.524 --> 18:23.760
This was probably commercial development was 
addressed later than residential, including

18:11.524 --> 18:23.760
apartment development. off-street parking was 
easier to apply there on individual sites in

18:24.027 --> 18:53.325
connection with apartment development 
commercial came a little bit later and

18:24.027 --> 18:53.325
how was the implementation of parkinson as 
received by the development community so far as a

18:24.027 --> 18:53.325
residential apartment there's no problem at all 
so far as commercial was concerned there was a good

18:24.027 --> 18:53.325
deal of consternation But it was quickly turned 
into acceptance when those developers realized

18:54.453 --> 19:10.012
that there was going to be, that the car was the most 
important thing they had to accommodate.

19:13.316 --> 19:18.823
Post-war period saw a tremendous amount of infill 
development in El Paso's lower valley. And today,

19:19.664 --> 19:30.560
it's not necessarily the most attractive area of 
the city, as we have a major arterial that runs the

19:19.664 --> 19:30.560
length of the valley that is lined with commercial 
businesses and such. What was the thinking in

19:31.562 --> 19:35.207
terms of the planning for that area at the time? Did 
the growth in that area outstrip the planned

19:35.928 --> 19:41.376
documents that were in effect? The old arterial to 
which you refer is known as Alameda now. And it was

19:47.643 --> 19:52.248
originally, or before that, it was US Highway 80. 
And before that, it was State Highway 1. So

19:57.413 --> 20:04.441
consequently, the creation of that facility 
predated any real planning in the area. It was

20:04.461 --> 20:06.463
totally in the rural area. An interesting facet of 
that,

20:07.464 --> 20:16.333
Texas adopted

20:21.747 --> 20:49.932
a statute providing for subdivision regulation 
within five miles of the city limits which at one

20:21.747 --> 20:49.932
point in time was declared unconstitutional

20:21.747 --> 20:49.932
which rather clandestinely as far as el paso was 
concerned came came back on the books and for some

20:21.747 --> 20:49.932
period of time the there was no planting beyond the 
city limits. In other words, where the city limits

20:53.678 --> 20:59.845
stopped was where planting stopped for the 
community. Consequently, the lower valley area

20:59.865 --> 21:06.934
you're talking about, if you're referring to, was 
largely developed without a plant. The Oceanda

21:07.715 --> 21:18.147
Heights and the Ranchland Hills area, the 
lakeside and Miller's Lakeside, all these

21:07.715 --> 21:18.147
outlying subdivisions just sort of came into 
being without a plan, and consequently you have

21:19.932 --> 21:31.632
offset streets, you have discontinuous streets, 
and you have rather poor circulation. It is an area

21:32.132 --> 21:46.176
of the city that has a very inadequate 
thoroughfare plan today where it seems as though

21:32.132 --> 21:46.176
all the major arterials are running parallel to 
each other, and it makes it a problem to get around

21:32.132 --> 21:46.176
in. And many of the arterials that enabled you to 
get around at all were created after the fact,

21:46.932 --> 21:56.041
expensively, at a later date, after planning came 
into the area.

21:59.565 --> 22:02.387
Well, that seems to be an area that grew without 
much control. There was an area to the north that's

22:02.428 --> 22:11.917
known generally as Cielo Vista, which has an 
interesting history in terms of some of its

22:02.428 --> 22:11.917
planning history. Were you involved in any of that 
or aware of it? Yes, the Department of Planning was

22:15.637 --> 22:25.749
involved in some of the earlier in-house master 
planning of the aerial. This was originally

22:26.630 --> 22:31.977
called the Winfrey's Nose Tract. It's just a big 
piece of land south of the airport that was owned by

22:32.978 --> 22:44.952
the federal government and acquired in 
connection with the airport facility. was turned

22:45.151 --> 22:55.342
over to the airport for disposition, the proceeds 
of which were to go 100% into the improvement of the

22:45.151 --> 22:55.342
airport area. The Department of Planning got into 
the act regarding the early disposition of a part

22:56.223 --> 23:04.611
of it. There was a reluctance to hire consultants 
to do the work. So consequently, the department

23:09.617 --> 23:12.880
was kind of pressed into into service to provide 
some orderly disposal and development of it.

23:22.936 --> 23:42.495
The area between Montana and Edgemere, to a large 
degree, was planned by consulting engineers

23:22.936 --> 23:42.495
working for the private developers who purchased 
the earlier sections of the land. Later on, we were

23:43.370 --> 23:56.227
successful in the later stages of it, getting the 
airport to hire a consultant to master plan most of

23:43.370 --> 23:56.227
the remaining area. In fact, all the remaining 
area, both as to orderly disposition on a timely

23:58.130 --> 24:05.580
basis, and master planning streets and parks and 
schools and other facilities that would normally

24:06.252 --> 24:13.642
be in a large subdivision area. So the city took on a 
role beyond simply the preparation of a general

24:14.203 --> 24:20.832
plan document, but preparing a rather specific 
master plan in that area. In the earlier stages,

24:21.433 --> 24:24.437
this is correct. Was it pretty faithfully 
implemented? Oh, yes. Yes. It was both the city's

24:29.124 --> 24:34.251
part in the coordination of the earlier 
subdivisions and then in the after the master plan

24:34.568 --> 25:03.715
was actually

24:34.568 --> 25:03.715
closely on down to the to the southernmost portion 
of it which was impacted to a degree by the freeway

24:34.568 --> 25:03.715
interstate 10 which was developed after the whole 
master plan was actually adopted. Today, when we

25:07.955 --> 25:19.870
think about the southeast part of the city, we 
refer generally to the area between Montana

25:07.955 --> 25:19.870
Avenue and Interstate 10, and Interstate 10 is the 
driving force for much of that development. The

25:19.890 --> 25:29.561
period when you worked for the department, 
Interstate 10 didn't exist, and its alignment

25:19.890 --> 25:29.561
hadn't been determined, and perhaps even the 
concept of what a freeway is was not fully

25:19.890 --> 25:29.561
understood. Can you describe that for me? Yes, the 
Department of Transportation, well, Texas

25:32.146 --> 25:49.186
Highway Department at the time, knew that there 
ultimately would be a freeway coming through the

25:32.146 --> 25:49.186
El Paso area, but they weren't sure what a freeway 
was or what size it was. They had no criteria for a

25:49.307 --> 25:52.330
freeway. So the Department of Planning, working 
with the Highway Department, designated what's

25:53.712 --> 26:02.102
now known as Edgemere Drives as the future 
location of the freeway. It paralleled Montana

26:06.675 --> 26:08.378
Street. It was 200 feet wide. It incorporated as 
much as at that time, which was before any freeways

26:11.523 --> 26:21.078
were actually constructed. As a matter of fact, 
the formal document that we had to go on was a study

26:22.100 --> 26:30.553
that was prepared back in 1940. which referred to 
interregional highways prepared by the federal

26:30.922 --> 26:35.726
government. That was kind of the Bible, but it 
didn't really tell much about what a freeway was

26:35.746 --> 26:39.890
going to look like. So consequently, we 
designated this 200-foot strip as a reserved area

26:40.630 --> 26:53.702
so that we wouldn't get the area cut off totally and 
require a lot of demolition of structures in order

26:40.630 --> 26:53.702
to get this freeway through. Later on, it was 
determined this was totally inadequate. It was

26:58.086 --> 26:59.747
not properly located. And the Highway 
Department's actual location for Interstate 10

26:59.963 --> 27:15.043
was from a half a mile to several miles south and not 
parallel to Montana, but more or less dividing

26:59.963 --> 27:15.043
equally the area between the river and Montana. 
You mentioned a while ago that a lot of the highway

27:16.565 --> 27:22.012
facilities seem to parallel one another. This is 
true, but then the way El Paso is, the

27:22.053 --> 27:29.903
configuration, the squeeze between Mexico and 
the south the mountain that pokes down in the

27:30.946 --> 27:39.680
middle of it, and the military reservation that 
takes a big hunk out of the northeast section. So

27:40.481 --> 27:49.435
really and truly, we have a thoroughfare system 
that kind of wanders around between these fixed

27:40.481 --> 27:49.435
facilities. And that's the direction that 
traffic has to move, and that's the way the

27:50.516 --> 27:55.424
facilities are built. And they do end up, many 
facilities, more or less parallel.

28:03.127 --> 28:12.656
The period between 1950 and 1960 saw the city 
better than double in population from about

28:03.127 --> 28:12.656
130,000 to over 270,000. There was a lot of growth 
and change. From your perception, describe what

28:17.281 --> 28:25.529
the community, describe that period of growth and 
what it meant to the community and where it came

28:17.281 --> 28:25.529
from. OK. I was absent from the community from 52 to 
56 when I was in the, Air Force during the Korean

28:32.590 --> 28:35.653
festivities. When I left in 1952, June the 9th, the 
Department of Planning consisted of three

28:37.115 --> 28:45.263
people. The community was growing. When I came 
back in 1956, the Department of Planning had grown

28:48.767 --> 28:53.813
to about seven or eight people. The former 
director, Mr. Stockwell, had retired. We had a new

28:58.758 --> 29:01.821
planning director, Loudon Lingo, And we had 
really begun more fully the planning process.

29:10.419 --> 29:16.145
There was some money being committed to capital 
improvements on a fairly regular basis each year

29:10.419 --> 29:16.145
with the budget. Consequently, the planning was 
beginning to come into its own.

29:26.276 --> 29:32.162
The large growth you referred to came about 
primarily because of what so many people had

29:32.969 --> 29:46.122
discovered in the Southwest as to climate, as to 
interest in the area and the charm of the area. And

29:46.142 --> 30:00.597
there was an awful lot of returning GIs, people who 
had been stationed here, who had been assigned

29:46.142 --> 30:00.597
here for a period of time, and the military as 
civilians coming back into the community made the

29:46.142 --> 30:00.597
biggest impact and the biggest part of that 
growth. along with industrial development in the

30:00.931 --> 30:03.995
area.

30:09.042 --> 30:17.554
In the pre-war period, Juarez was a sleepy 
community, and El Paso was the dominant

30:09.042 --> 30:17.554
community, at least twice the size of Juarez. As El 
Paso grew, it continued to outpace the growth of

30:19.216 --> 30:29.250
Juarez for a period of time.

30:32.572 --> 30:37.217
It's interesting because Oahuas today is 
probably two and a half times the size of El Paso.

30:37.397 --> 30:37.818
Easily. And, of course, this is largely due to the 
economic situation and the migration to the north

30:38.879 --> 30:46.908
and across the border. The, I would say, migration 
to the north and the whole trend of urbanization,

30:49.030 --> 30:59.642
the rural population migrating to the cities, I 
suppose, is contributing to the growth of Oahuas.

31:00.601 --> 31:12.904
Well, most of the growth of wars, obviously, is due 
to the fact that it offers some hope of migration to

31:00.601 --> 31:12.904
the United States, and twin-plan concepts, and so 
on, so on, so on. Well-known. During that period,

31:15.630 --> 31:18.475
you mentioned a lot of the Wingo.
