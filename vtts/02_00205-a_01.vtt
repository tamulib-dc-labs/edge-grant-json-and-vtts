00:03.136 --> 00:13.110
I'm sitting in room 216 of what is now the History Building, getting ready to chat with Dr. Betty Utterberger about her experiences here.

00:13.891 --> 00:18.357
Now, Betty, would you say a sentence or so, and so we can test and see if your mic's working?

00:18.377 --> 00:18.497
Yes.

00:19.198 --> 00:25.347
Well, this is going to be fun, I think, to talk about the past, which I don't talk about very often.

00:30.271 --> 00:44.397
Betty, for the benefit of a person who might read the transcript or listen to this tape at some future time and not know about your background, give us a biographical summary before you came to A&M.

00:44.417 --> 00:48.465
Tell us about your growing up and where you studied and served before here.

00:49.205 --> 01:07.618
I was born in Glasgow, Scotland and came over here actually as a baby with my parents and grew up in Pennsylvania, then left the state and went to Syracuse University.

01:09.033 --> 01:17.984
for my BA degree, where I majored in history and political science with a minor in speech.

01:18.564 --> 01:20.206
You could do that in those days.

01:21.047 --> 01:29.978
And then I went on to Harvard for my master's degree, and then to Duke University for my PhD.

01:31.544 --> 01:44.936
My experience as a graduate student in history were sometimes rather difficult because I found that it was not a field that was too hospitable to women.

01:45.877 --> 02:01.551
And so very often I found that I was the only woman in most of my graduate classes, and I think the only woman who was up for a PhD in American Diplomatic History at Duke University.

02:01.531 --> 02:19.354
So my early academic career was one where I felt very much alone and where I was told very pointedly that history and the teaching of history was not for women.

02:19.334 --> 02:30.269
And in fact, I remember so vividly when I went down to Duke that the head of the department, I had come down on a fellowship, so I thought maybe they might want me.

02:31.911 --> 02:45.510
But indeed, I went into the head of the department and for two and a half hours, that wonderful old man told me that history was no place for a woman.

02:45.490 --> 02:54.782
that I was taking the bread out of the mouths of deserving men and that what in the world did I want to do it for anyway?

02:54.842 --> 03:01.790
I'd only go off, get married, have children, and that would be the end of all the money that was being spent on me.

03:02.932 --> 03:07.077
So I remember vividly that

03:07.057 --> 03:14.427
I walked out into the sunlight and I was bound and determined I wasn't going to cry, Haskell.

03:14.547 --> 03:24.762
Not there, but I was so impressed with his office because there were books all over the desk and books from floor to ceiling and I thought, oh, this is paradise.

03:25.683 --> 03:30.810
And then when I walked outdoors, I just felt so crushed.

03:30.870 --> 03:32.232
I thought, what am I going to do?

03:32.272 --> 03:36.658
And I blinked hard to keep the tears from coming.

03:36.638 --> 03:46.133
And I said, I'm going to stay, and I'm going to show them, but I'm not going to open my mouth in class.

03:46.915 --> 03:49.118
And I didn't for six months.

03:49.759 --> 03:51.142
I went to all my classes.

03:51.542 --> 03:56.130
I sat as invisibly as possible, and I didn't open my mouth.

03:56.971 --> 04:03.642
And then, of course, I had the very good fortune of studying with Charles Sidner at the time.

04:03.622 --> 04:08.309
Charles Sidner was probably one of the greats in Southern history.

04:08.389 --> 04:16.081
In fact, I was sorely tempted to go into Southern history because I was so impressed by him and by his scholarship.

04:16.582 --> 04:27.599
And so when I had to do a seminar paper for him, he said that he wanted it to be from primary sources, and if possible, from manuscript sources.

04:28.260 --> 04:31.705
So I went to the Manuscripts Division of the Duke Library,

04:32.917 --> 04:36.322
And I looked around at the papers and the holdings that they had.

04:36.722 --> 04:42.150
And I saw the name of a man named Braidwood, John Braidwood.

04:42.510 --> 04:44.373
Now, John Braidwood was a Scot.

04:44.934 --> 04:51.163
And I had heard my father speak about John Braidwood because my father was trained in music.

04:51.223 --> 04:55.509
In fact, he had come over to this country to study at the Washington Conservatory of Music.

04:56.029 --> 05:02.198
And so he was very interested in voice and speaking and enunciation, particularly.

05:02.178 --> 05:10.692
And so he had told me about how John Braidwood had tried to teach deaf people how to speak.

05:11.313 --> 05:17.944
And so I saw this name and I thought, I wonder if this could be in any way associated with the Braidwood that I knew.

05:17.984 --> 05:22.431
And I found there was a whole collection of these wonderful papers

05:22.411 --> 05:26.237
from the colonial period of John Braidwood.

05:26.377 --> 05:27.619
So that settled it.

05:27.979 --> 05:30.143
I was going to write a paper and I did.

05:30.203 --> 05:39.357
I wrote that first paper on John Braidwood and the first efforts to establish a school for the deaf and dumb in the United States.

05:39.937 --> 05:43.002
I finished the paper and

05:44.095 --> 05:50.270
Professor Sidner had every student come into his office to talk to them about the paper.

05:50.310 --> 05:54.741
So my turn came, and I went in with fear and trembling.

05:56.184 --> 05:59.472
And Dr. Sidner said,

05:59.452 --> 06:02.837
Well, I see you know how to write the English language.

06:03.878 --> 06:06.301
And I looked at him and I said, well, I hope so.

06:06.341 --> 06:09.005
I do have a master's degree from Harvard.

06:09.986 --> 06:13.752
And he said, well, he said, this is a fine paper.

06:14.372 --> 06:16.575
And he says, I know that you're a struggling student.

06:16.976 --> 06:19.700
Why don't you send it off to the Reader's Digest?

06:20.060 --> 06:22.243
He said, you can make $500 on it.

06:23.245 --> 06:25.628
And I drew myself up to my full height.

06:26.249 --> 06:28.632
And I said, I'm not a journalist.

06:29.152 --> 06:30.535
I'm a historian.

06:31.778 --> 06:33.061
And so he said, oh.

06:33.843 --> 06:46.975
He said, well, in that case, he said, send the paper off to Professor Binkley, who is the editor of the Journal of Southern History, and you tell him that I told you to send it.

06:46.955 --> 07:00.190
So, I grabbed that paper out of his hands, I rushed upstairs, went to the library, searched every possible place where I could add something to make the paper better, and wrote the letter to Binkley.

07:00.711 --> 07:09.121
And within two weeks I got a response and he said, your article will appear in the next issue of the Journal of Southern History.

07:09.201 --> 07:11.123
Well, that did it.

07:11.103 --> 07:22.799
That was when I found out that even though they might not listen to me in class or notice that I was there, that they didn't notice you if you did good research and writing.

07:23.781 --> 07:27.406
And so I concentrated my attention and my effort on that.

07:27.646 --> 07:32.032
So that's anyway the background of my graduate school experience.

07:32.052 --> 07:37.099
And of course, the same thing happened as I tried to get a position in academe.

07:37.339 --> 07:40.063
I found that women were just not acceptable.

07:40.043 --> 07:46.875
Although in the South, you had a better chance because women would work for less.

07:48.077 --> 07:51.423
And so I can remember this vividly.

07:52.925 --> 07:57.293
My husband had been in World War II, and he had been very badly injured.

07:58.792 --> 08:03.198
Actually, he was blown up in a jeep in a land mine in the Philippines.

08:03.679 --> 08:15.857
And so he'd been in a camp for, in a hospital for shell-shocked and brain-damaged veterans.

08:16.378 --> 08:22.346
And I had taken a home out there so I could be with him all the time that he was in the hospital.

08:22.787 --> 08:26.492
And they had told him that he would never be able to go on to graduate school again.

08:26.532 --> 08:28.275
And so I,

08:29.740 --> 08:30.436
I...

08:31.664 --> 08:33.907
We had to decide what we were going to do.

08:34.047 --> 08:35.950
And I said, let's not give up.

08:36.270 --> 08:38.773
You've always wanted to go on and get a PhD.

08:39.474 --> 08:43.440
And all we can do is find out that it's not possible.

08:44.261 --> 08:46.423
And doctors are very frequently wrong.

08:47.164 --> 08:49.487
And so let's try.

08:49.507 --> 08:52.491
We have nothing to lose and everything to gain.

08:53.232 --> 08:59.781
And so the reason I went to Duke was because I got the most money and because

08:59.761 --> 09:02.105
I had a very dear friend at Harvard.

09:02.145 --> 09:09.678
He was the dean of the Harvard Graduate School, Howard Mumford Jones, and he had taken a very great interest in me and my work.

09:10.059 --> 09:17.171
In fact, he had given me away when I was married, and he was the one who had persuaded me to marry Robert.

09:17.292 --> 09:24.925
I was never going to marry, but he was the one who actually had persuaded me to marry Robert.

09:24.905 --> 09:31.773
And so I went to talk to him about what to do in this situation that we found ourselves in.

09:31.873 --> 09:34.736
He said, you go ahead, follow your heart.

09:34.937 --> 09:37.039
If you think you can do it and Bob can do it.

09:37.359 --> 09:38.621
He said, but don't stay here.

09:39.021 --> 09:40.623
This weather is too cold.

09:42.085 --> 09:44.127
Just find a place where it's more temperate.

09:44.187 --> 09:47.311
The pace is perhaps a little easier and so on.

09:47.351 --> 09:48.432
So I did.

09:48.918 --> 09:50.760
And that's why we went to Duke.

09:51.081 --> 09:54.304
And Bob was, of course, on veterans' benefits, so we went.

09:54.445 --> 09:56.567
It was a rough, rough year, I will tell you.

09:57.428 --> 10:12.546
But he persevered, and somehow his brain cells began to take over where the memory cells had been damaged, and gradually he was able to

10:14.197 --> 10:18.163
do the work, not only do his work, but he had a fellowship the second year.

10:18.964 --> 10:24.533
In any case, it was, but we didn't have any money.

10:25.073 --> 10:32.805
So I petitioned after two years at Duke to take my prelims early so I could get out and teach, and I was allowed to do that.

10:32.925 --> 10:37.352
So the first job I had, the first job offer I had,

10:37.332 --> 10:39.215
was from Wake Forest.

10:40.537 --> 10:45.705
And I still remember the letter from the head of the Department of History.

10:45.725 --> 10:51.414
And it was in handwriting, just cramped little handwriting.

10:51.815 --> 11:04.875
And he offered me the position of teaching history in the Department of History at Wake Forest, saying that I would teach five different courses in history.

11:04.855 --> 11:19.185
and that they would pay me $2,200, and that I would have the honor of being the first woman appointed at Wake Forest.

11:19.385 --> 11:22.573
Now, as far as you know, this was the entire faculty?

11:22.593 --> 11:24.176
No, I think it was just history.

11:24.397 --> 11:25.580
I think it was just history.

11:26.542 --> 11:30.692
And so, well, I was thrilled, of course, to even have an offer.

11:31.514 --> 11:37.107
But I just didn't know how we were going to make it on that small sum of money.

11:37.087 --> 11:47.956
And so then I continued to try for another position, and the department told me that there was an opening at what is now East Carolina University.

11:48.838 --> 11:52.969
And so I went and interviewed at East Carolina.

11:52.949 --> 12:02.499
And they offered me a position in the History Department, also with the honor of being the first woman in the Department of History.

12:02.799 --> 12:05.683
But they offered me $3,200, $1,000 more.

12:07.745 --> 12:10.928
So I knew that Wake Forest was more prestigious.

12:11.589 --> 12:19.277
But I thought, right now it's not prestige, but money.

12:19.375 --> 12:22.901
So I accepted the appointment at East Carolina.

12:22.921 --> 12:24.364
And I taught there for two years.

12:24.965 --> 12:30.615
And I found out how difficult it was to really be alone.

12:30.675 --> 12:38.128
That was no collegiality, just doing your work.

12:38.368 --> 12:41.113
And that was it.

12:41.093 --> 13:02.272
Then after that, my husband and I, and of course every summer and every evening from 6 o'clock at night until midnight, I worked on a dissertation because I knew that if I couldn't finish that dissertation at that time, if I had to leave the area, that it would not get finished.

13:02.372 --> 13:04.536
I had been warned about that.

13:04.516 --> 13:12.050
And every summer, I went to Washington, DC, and I worked in the National Archives and the Library of Congress, Manuscripts Division, et cetera.

13:12.691 --> 13:14.996
And I was able to complete my degree.

13:15.336 --> 13:21.428
And Bob and I both got our PhDs at Duke in 1950.

13:21.408 --> 13:23.852
And what was your dissertation topic?

13:23.872 --> 13:31.443
My dissertation was on the origins of American intervention in Russia in 1918 to 1920.

13:31.724 --> 13:47.668
It was a topic that was, well, I was very fortunate because I was the first person to get access to the newly declassified records in the National Archives on the United States and the Russian Revolution.

13:47.648 --> 13:52.935
So I had this marvelous opportunity, and there's so many stories I could tell you about that, but I won't go into it.

13:53.776 --> 13:57.221
But in any case, then we went out to California.

13:57.982 --> 14:04.131
Bob had a position with the research laboratories of Standard Oil of California.

14:04.831 --> 14:08.897
And so we went off there, and then I tried to get a job.

14:08.877 --> 14:21.400
out there, and I wrote 50 letters at least to every institution in the whole area, and there was no affirmative action at that time.

14:21.420 --> 14:26.029
And so I would get back these letters that said, we do not hire women.

14:26.229 --> 14:27.291
That was it.

14:27.271 --> 14:29.894
And I was just distraught.

14:30.074 --> 14:36.903
I could not understand how it would be possible for me ever to get a job, because I wasn't about to have a sex change.

14:37.684 --> 14:39.907
And I didn't know what I could do.

14:40.287 --> 14:46.455
You can change a lot of things, but there's one thing you can't do, for the most part, is to change your gender.

14:47.196 --> 14:50.520
And so I was really very desperate.

14:50.620 --> 14:56.147
But at every opportunity, I would walk, go around, and visit the department.

14:56.127 --> 15:03.219
colleges and try to interview and see if there wasn't some possibility of getting an appointment.

15:03.860 --> 15:08.588
Well, as it turned out, I finally was able to get an appointment at Whittier College.

15:09.109 --> 15:19.587
And initially, it was not because of my history background, but it was because I had such a fine liberal arts education.

15:19.567 --> 15:26.082
And so the Ford Foundation had given Whittier College a grant to establish a liberal arts center.

15:26.724 --> 15:36.005
And this was supposed to encompass all of the liberal arts and provide opportunities for actually adults to go on and do graduate work.

15:36.045 --> 15:37.288
It was at a time

15:37.268 --> 15:58.967
when there was much concern about engineers and technicians being so narrow in their viewpoint that they didn't have the background to really engage in some of the very broad international events that were taking place and dealings and so on.

15:59.047 --> 16:06.634
So this was one of the things that the Ford Foundation at that time was doing, was really promoting liberal arts.

16:06.614 --> 16:10.745
And so they were looking for someone to be the director.

16:11.487 --> 16:17.242
And they were cooperating with the president of Whittier College in the selection.

16:17.864 --> 16:23.138
And so I applied and I got the position.

16:23.118 --> 16:28.485
And there were test centers for liberal arts all over the country.

16:28.646 --> 16:32.030
UCLA had one, University of Virginia, University of Michigan.

16:32.351 --> 16:37.998
Whittier College was, I think, one of the two small private liberal arts colleges that had it.

16:38.259 --> 16:45.108
Well, it was a wonderful experience, and I had great opportunities to design programs in the liberal arts.

16:45.428 --> 16:52.618
And as it turned out, the center at Whittier College became the very best center in the whole country.

16:52.598 --> 16:58.987
And so I had received a lot of approbation for that.

17:00.489 --> 17:16.550
But at the same time, I should tell you that my dissertation had won the prize at Duke University for the best dissertation in any field for the last three years.

17:17.591 --> 17:22.538
And so that meant that they were going to publish my dissertation.

17:22.518 --> 17:32.513
And so I, of course, was very, very busy revising the dissertation, doing new research, et cetera, so I could get it out.

17:32.953 --> 17:37.119
Then in 1956, the dissertation came out.

17:37.280 --> 17:39.683
It was published.

17:41.435 --> 17:51.752
Again, it won the prize of the American Historical Association for the best dissertation by a younger scholar in any field.

17:52.272 --> 17:55.798
Well, I think that really helped tremendously.

17:56.319 --> 18:03.190
So then, when jobs began to open up around and I could apply, I had a very nice vitae.

18:03.170 --> 18:21.212
because by that time I had also published a number of articles as well as the book, and so I was fortunate in getting an appointment at California State University at Fullerton, and again as the first woman in the history department.

18:21.985 --> 18:25.950
So again, I had this wonderful opportunity to teach everything.

18:26.171 --> 18:30.637
I mean, all this time, I want you to know that I taught everything.

18:30.817 --> 18:32.799
I taught Renaissance and Reformation.

18:32.880 --> 18:34.161
I taught modern Europe.

18:34.341 --> 18:37.626
I taught Latin American history.

18:37.786 --> 18:40.069
I taught Asian civilizations.

18:40.630 --> 18:42.212
I taught Russian history.

18:42.572 --> 18:46.778
At Whittier College, I think I may well have been the very first person

18:46.758 --> 18:52.567
to teach a course in Russian-American relations because it was the beginning of the Cold War.

18:53.048 --> 18:58.836
And I was really concerned about the lack of knowledge about US-Russian relations, et cetera.

18:58.856 --> 19:00.279
So I designed this course.

19:01.100 --> 19:04.245
And it was very well attended.

19:04.545 --> 19:12.377
And of course, I got into all kinds of trouble because people thought I was a liberal, pinko, red.

19:12.357 --> 19:27.197
because I was teaching this course and also because I let my students talk about very delicate subjects like should China be admitted to the United Nations, etc.

19:27.797 --> 19:33.505
And I did have a very unhappy experience because one of the members of the Board of Trustees

19:34.767 --> 19:47.224
at Whittier College thought I ought to be fired because I was putting all of these misguided ideas into the heads of my students, which I wasn't at all.

19:48.165 --> 19:52.371
But in any case, this was the McCarthy period.

19:52.972 --> 19:55.155
And I was in Los Angeles County.

19:55.135 --> 19:59.845
And it was just one of the strongholds of McCarthyism.

20:00.646 --> 20:05.075
And so this was a very sad experience.

20:05.316 --> 20:09.064
But I have to tell you a story that I think is so important.

20:09.284 --> 20:12.250
I think for the historical record, it's important.

20:12.230 --> 20:23.991
And that is that when the president called me in and he said that I was being very strongly criticized because of what I was teaching.

20:24.031 --> 20:24.792
This is Whittier.

20:24.932 --> 20:26.154
This is at Whittier College.

20:26.235 --> 20:29.380
And Whittier College is a very fine liberal arts institution.

20:29.741 --> 20:33.327
In fact, it was a school that Richard Nixon had gone to.

20:33.307 --> 20:41.401
And I had heard Richard Nixon give a commencement speech, and I thought it was a very fine commencement speech at the time.

20:41.882 --> 20:51.298
I mean, he even talked about Southeast Asia, and he talked about it in a way that seemed that he understood what was going on there, etc.

20:51.278 --> 21:01.400
But in any case, I asked if I could at least talk with the person who was so strongly opposed to me.

21:02.061 --> 21:06.030
And so the president arranged for me to meet, I'll tell you his name.

21:06.631 --> 21:09.237
It was William E. Hughes.

21:09.217 --> 21:12.241
And so he... H-U-G-H-E-S.

21:12.481 --> 21:15.105
H-U-G-H-E-S.

21:15.165 --> 21:19.631
And I learned a great deal from Mr. Hughes.

21:20.332 --> 21:22.154
And he was an elderly gentleman.

21:22.755 --> 21:28.002
One of the things I learned from Mr. Hughes was that you're never too old to learn.

21:28.042 --> 21:31.547
That there's always hope for you.

21:32.047 --> 21:33.389
And so keep on trying.

21:33.729 --> 21:36.073
Well, anyway, Mr. Hughes took me out to the country club.

21:36.854 --> 21:37.975
And...

21:37.955 --> 21:55.971
We had lunch together, and I, young, starry-eyed, idealistic as I was, believing so deeply in the democratic process, and having been educated by some of the truly great historians of our time, including Arthur Schlesinger Sr.

21:56.011 --> 22:02.317
and Howard Mumford Jones, and just really great, great scholars.

22:02.457 --> 22:05.920
And so I had certainly learned well.

22:05.900 --> 22:27.705
And I was convinced of the importance of always providing opportunities for students to learn how to think for themselves, to discover how to think, how to use their heads, etc., and to provide them with a body of knowledge that was worthy of their understanding.

22:28.411 --> 22:39.008
And so I tried to tell Mr. Hughes what education was all about, and particularly education in a free society.

22:40.090 --> 22:42.955
And he listened and he asked questions.

22:43.295 --> 22:48.664
And I told him, you know, in the Soviet Union, I could never teach like this.

22:48.644 --> 23:02.137
They don't ever allow their students to study a variety of interpretations and viewpoints and opposing documentary materials, et cetera, because they already think they have the truth.

23:02.697 --> 23:06.621
But I said, in our society, we trust our students.

23:06.982 --> 23:11.065
We respect their capacity to be able to use their heads, et cetera.

23:11.406 --> 23:17.892
And so we need to provide them with the opportunity to exercise those intellectual faculties.

23:17.872 --> 23:26.422
And so I went on giving him the usual kind of a strong statement about education in a free society.

23:26.983 --> 23:31.027
And he listened, and he asked questions, and I responded.

23:31.668 --> 23:37.755
And then we went to lunch a second time, and the second time we talked again.

23:37.815 --> 23:40.559
And that was the end of that.

23:40.999 --> 23:43.542
He never pushed any charges against me.

23:43.522 --> 23:48.528
The next semester, Mr. Hughes enrolled in one of my courses.

23:51.212 --> 23:57.260
And he sat through the course and he loved what was happening to the students.

23:57.840 --> 24:04.709
He saw the intellectual ferment that existed in the classroom and the way in which I really sought to cultivate that.

24:05.490 --> 24:10.677
And at the end of the semester, he came to me and he said, I like what you're doing.

24:10.657 --> 24:13.361
And he said, how can we expand this?

24:14.243 --> 24:17.087
And he said, I was wondering, what do you think about this, he said.

24:17.127 --> 24:22.676
And he told me that he had this idea of having a university on a ship.

24:23.477 --> 24:28.345
And the ship would travel all over the world, and students would come in.

24:28.325 --> 24:48.561
from all over the world, and they would enroll together, and they would get to know each other, and they would sit in classrooms together, and as the ship went into each port, there would be opportunities for students to get out off the ship and to visit in the areas of their own discipline,

24:48.541 --> 24:54.814
and to have professors from universities in those ports come on the ship and talk to them, et cetera.

24:55.215 --> 24:58.482
Well, the whole idea was just wonderful, I thought.

24:59.224 --> 25:01.749
So he said, what do you think about that?

25:01.849 --> 25:03.894
I said, well, I thought it was a great idea.

25:03.974 --> 25:05.818
He said, would you help me to start it?

25:06.359 --> 25:07.782
I said, yes.

25:07.762 --> 25:13.453
So I became the executive secretary of the University of the Seven Seas.

25:14.175 --> 25:24.115
And so we planned a curriculum, we got professors appointed from all over Southern California, and we had to get a ship.

25:25.357 --> 25:28.183
And at that time,

25:29.024 --> 25:32.892
And so Israel offered us a ship.

25:32.913 --> 25:35.298
We had the opportunity to get a ship from Israel.

25:35.879 --> 25:48.687
But the problem was at that time, there was this terrible conflict going on with Israel and the Arab states, and they had closed the Suez Canal to all Israeli shipping.

25:49.240 --> 25:53.664
So we couldn't take the ship because we couldn't go through the Suez Canal.

25:54.185 --> 25:56.848
And then the Netherlands offered us a ship.

25:56.868 --> 25:58.049
It was a Rotterdam.

25:58.630 --> 26:02.133
And so the Rotterdam became our first ship.

26:02.774 --> 26:05.857
And our first students went off on the Rotterdam.

26:06.277 --> 26:09.661
And that was the beginning of the University of the Seven Seas.

26:09.701 --> 26:14.826
We got it accredited by the Western Association for Accreditation.

26:14.806 --> 26:18.734
And that started the University of the Seven Seas.

26:18.954 --> 26:21.339
It has been going ever since.

26:23.603 --> 26:26.930
Chapman College, a private Baptist college, carried it on.

26:26.990 --> 26:30.958
And then the University of Pittsburgh began a program

26:31.613 --> 26:42.093
The one out of Chapman College was called Campus Afloat, and the one at University of Pittsburgh is of course still going, but that program started well.

26:42.433 --> 26:52.913
You can imagine what a wonderful thing it was that out of all of this turmoil in the McCarthy period that great good had come.

26:52.893 --> 27:08.370
at least as far as my own personal experience was because I saw that it was possible to really change people's minds through education and since that time I have met

27:08.350 --> 27:13.036
tens of thousands of students who have been on that program.

27:13.397 --> 27:18.904
And I have seen what a tremendous difference it has made in their outlook.

27:19.485 --> 27:21.828
So that was that.

27:21.868 --> 27:31.000
Then I went on, but then I had a terrible bout with cancer.

27:30.980 --> 27:48.938
I was able to survive, but when I came back to Whittier College, after a number of major surgeries, I felt like people were just expecting me to die at any minute.

27:48.918 --> 27:52.783
And I didn't want to be in that state.

27:52.963 --> 27:54.605
And so I wanted to get out of there.

27:54.645 --> 28:02.235
I just wanted to put that all behind me and go somewhere where people didn't know what I had just gone through.

28:02.675 --> 28:04.778
And so I began to look elsewhere.

28:05.399 --> 28:10.845
And that's when I had the chance to get the appointment at California State University.

28:11.446 --> 28:13.048
And I went there.

28:13.749 --> 28:15.872
And I started over again.

28:16.973 --> 28:18.655
Fullerton, at that point, was

28:18.635 --> 28:19.478
It was?

28:19.499 --> 28:23.214
It was Orange State College.

28:23.234 --> 28:25.805
And it was small and the area was not that.

28:26.006 --> 28:28.054
Yeah, oh, I will tell you.

28:28.912 --> 28:35.240
At that point, there were orange groves from Fullerton to Whittier.

28:35.841 --> 28:39.165
It was just wide open, and it was just beautiful.

28:39.625 --> 28:47.555
The air was filled with the smell of orange blossoms, and it was just, I mean, there were barracks for the college.

28:48.496 --> 28:53.442
They only had a few buildings, and it was a great pioneering opportunity.

28:53.503 --> 28:56.286
Well, I like pioneering opportunities.

28:56.266 --> 28:59.770
So I really worked to build that program.

29:00.011 --> 29:08.040
And the head of the department, Giles T. Brown, was a very wonderful man who was very supportive of me, I must say.

29:08.060 --> 29:14.869
And so I taught all kinds of courses there.

29:14.929 --> 29:22.358
And I had some very fine students.

29:24.245 --> 29:30.260
I didn't even know what tenure was at the time because I'd never had to go through that process.

29:30.320 --> 29:31.623
I didn't know anything about it.

29:32.145 --> 29:36.876
And so when I was interviewed and they asked me what my rank was, I didn't know what my rank was.

29:36.916 --> 29:41.207
And so I wrote back to the dean at Whittier College and I said,

29:42.503 --> 29:43.324
What's my rank?

29:43.344 --> 29:44.386
Do I have a rank?

29:45.367 --> 29:48.752
And so the dean wrote back and he said, yes.

29:49.093 --> 29:51.817
He said, you're an associate professor.

29:51.837 --> 29:55.482
So I told him that I was an associate professor, first time I knew about it.

29:55.923 --> 30:01.971
Because you see, you can't imagine how limited my view was about the history profession.

30:02.372 --> 30:07.560
They had a professional association in Southern California.

30:07.740 --> 30:11.245
It was called the History Guild.

30:11.225 --> 30:13.529
There were no women admitted.

30:15.172 --> 30:19.801
And this, I think, is important for the record in women's history, you know?

30:20.382 --> 30:24.670
There were no women admitted to the History Guild.

30:24.690 --> 30:27.816
And we had a visiting professor.

30:27.796 --> 30:29.738
from Ohio State.

30:30.539 --> 30:32.261
His name was Lowell Ragatz.

30:33.623 --> 30:36.046
And he was in African history.

30:36.847 --> 30:39.310
And Lowell and I became great friends.

30:39.410 --> 30:44.356
He liked the work that I had done on America's Siberian expedition.

30:45.096 --> 30:50.663
And, in fact, he encouraged me to put it in for some big prize of the American Historical Association.

30:50.703 --> 30:53.707
But I said, oh, no, no, no, that wouldn't work.

30:53.787 --> 30:54.968
I wouldn't do that.

30:55.673 --> 31:00.740
But in any case, he, of course, was invited to go to the History Guild.

31:00.760 --> 31:02.683
So he said, well, Betty, why don't you come along?

31:02.883 --> 31:05.387
I said, what's the History Guild?

31:05.407 --> 31:09.613
And so then he explained to me what it was, and I said, oh, I think that would be wonderful.

31:10.014 --> 31:14.560
I'd meet some of my colleagues in history.

31:15.333 --> 31:18.498
I planned on going, and I was very excited about the opportunity.

31:19.219 --> 31:23.085
And then Lowell told the president.

31:23.125 --> 31:26.670
The president was a historian, Paul Smith.

31:27.311 --> 31:29.214
And he was a constitutional historian.

31:29.335 --> 31:32.279
And he said, oh, it's very bad.

31:32.339 --> 31:34.202
He said, you know, she's.
