WEBVTT

00:01.583 --> 00:02.904
that 15 seconds. That's so that you won't miss 
something on the tape. I

00:05.407 --> 00:14.415
don't know.

00:14.435 --> 00:30.071
Now, then I don't think, I think if you're not 
subscribing to the idea, which appears

00:14.435 --> 00:30.071
frequently in the press, that the only way 
American fishermen can compete is to go into this

00:14.435 --> 00:30.071
kind of mass market fishing of the Russian and the 
Japanese, that is sending out floating cities in

00:14.435 --> 00:30.071
effect. The fact is the My own viewpoint is that 
would be an economic catastrophe. I don't think

00:35.090 --> 00:36.753
they can compete that way. I don't think, in 
essence, by the way, I don't think world fisheries

00:36.833 --> 00:41.362
are now moving in that direction. If one takes a 
close examination in an economic sense in Europe

00:47.213 --> 00:50.496
and many other areas of those fishes that are 
really profitable. It's sort of the middle

00:50.576 --> 00:53.579
distant type of vessel. A vessel that's big enough 
to get out and have a reasonable operational

00:53.619 --> 01:04.830
range, but largely is essentially delivering to a 
local port in a particular region. And I think

01:05.551 --> 01:14.520
vessels of the class from 100 to 150 feet are going 
to be the dominant element of producing fish over

01:05.551 --> 01:14.520
the next 20 years, and I think that's for where most 
of your fish is going to come from. I think there's a

01:20.112 --> 01:30.724
lot of economic problems of taking large numbers 
of people to sea and maintaining them at sea,

01:20.112 --> 01:30.724
energy costs and other things that are going to 
essentially drive them out of that sort of

01:20.112 --> 01:30.724
business. I only have one more question now along 
this line before I return back to sort of a

01:31.825 --> 01:43.598
biographical approach, but I take it you think the 
200-mile limit was a wise decision on the part of

01:31.825 --> 01:43.598
the government. Well, I was very strongly in favor 
of the 200-mile limit, in spite of the fact that

01:44.673 --> 01:52.673
many of my colleagues in academia and elsewhere 
opposed it. Basically, I have felt that some sort

01:54.657 --> 01:59.830
of system had to come into existence where some 
entity was responsible. As it was, I saw just an

02:02.292 --> 02:05.118
international conflict. And although there were 
a lot of international commissions, they really

02:05.178 --> 02:13.276
didn't have the backbone or the authority to make 
the decisions. There was a great deal of

02:13.296 --> 02:15.200
procrastination. And I've been involved with 
many of these commissions. And I'd seen one

02:19.216 --> 02:26.409
fishery after the other throughout the world 
going into a depleted phase, many of which were

02:19.216 --> 02:26.409
under the commissions. And the institutional 
arrangements, their terms of reference, in my

02:27.210 --> 02:37.528
view, just didn't allow for them to essentially 
achieve sound conservation. So I think at least as

02:37.508 --> 02:47.521
a first step, I felt that somebody had to gain 
control and set up an institutional mechanism

02:37.508 --> 02:47.521
that decisions could be made in a reasonable time 
frame. Now all of those decisions I'm going to

02:47.602 --> 02:52.749
admit are not going to be as rational as we would 
like them. There's going to be politics involved

02:53.209 --> 02:56.253
to certain extent. There's going to be loose use of 
the data in terms of achievement, parochial

02:56.734 --> 03:02.241
interest. Now I'm on as the a scientific advisor 
and chairman for the North Pacific Council and

03:07.765 --> 03:15.298
also for the Pacific Council, I'll remember. And I 
think those scientific groups can have a

03:16.340 --> 03:24.314
tremendous impact on whether or not we ultimately 
are going to have a rational fisheries. Because

03:24.335 --> 03:25.757
one, they're independent. You know, they're not 
getting instructions from anybody, from their

03:26.142 --> 03:32.369
agencies or from the consul itself. And several 
instances already, our groups have come out in

03:32.649 --> 03:42.159
conflict with a consul decision that we thought 
was politically oriented and not associated with

03:32.649 --> 03:42.159
the facts. And I think the consul perceives it's 
going to be very difficult for them to essentially

03:42.239 --> 03:50.648
win in the courts. if the scientific advisory 
group has essentially come down in a very negative

03:50.881 --> 03:57.010
way on a particular approach. So I think the 
structure allows an opportunity to manage much

03:57.030 --> 04:04.621
more effectively than we have in the past. I am 
afraid of one thing, and that's that politics at a

04:04.741 --> 04:13.193
parochial level will not allow us to reach the 
intent of the law And that is, and I'll make it very

04:13.358 --> 04:23.835
clear, I don't want to see a law that essentially 
ends up forcing a lot of foreigners out of

04:13.358 --> 04:23.835
resources that we really aren't going to use. 
Waste of a large amount of food and raw material

04:23.856 --> 04:32.410
that's needed by many people in the world just to 
achieve some selfish local interest. If that

04:32.650 --> 04:37.358
happens, then ultimately I guess I'll feel that 
maybe I supported... a wrong type of

04:37.675 --> 04:39.900
institutional arrangement. But at this point in 
time, even though the councils have a lot of

04:39.920 --> 04:47.376
problems, I still look favorably on the 
arrangement. The law needs to be changed in

04:47.637 --> 04:54.452
certain ways, but nevertheless, I favor the 200 
mile, and I think it's ultimately going to be serve

04:54.854 --> 04:58.238
mankind better than the sort of free-for-all we 
had before. It may eventually, by the way, evolve

04:58.258 --> 05:00.981
into something else. And fine, if it does under 
some sort of proper controlled system, then I'll

05:01.542 --> 05:07.228
support it. And I think we do need the 
international input and cooperation. But at the

05:11.133 --> 05:19.663
time, and under the situation we were under, when 
the law came into existence, I fully supported it,

05:11.133 --> 05:19.663
and I still do. Now, during this period of your 
career, then, you're going back to graduate

05:21.432 --> 05:32.068
school and you're really working as associate 
director of the fisheries. No, at that time I was

05:32.088 --> 05:36.995
director of the exploratory fisheries group when 
I'm going back to graduate school. That's from

05:37.015 --> 05:41.061
starting in, I guess, about 60 through 67 that I was 
going. graduate school. Yeah, you finished your

05:42.606 --> 05:44.407
PhD in 67. Right. And then when you become 
associate director of fisheries? That's right.

05:48.931 --> 06:03.584
At that time, I was asked by the director of the 
Bureau of Commercial Fisheries if I'd come back

05:48.931 --> 06:03.584
and essentially become an associate in terms of 
research, associate director for research.

06:04.605 --> 06:10.710
Those were rather ill times for me because I went 
through some very difficult mental strain and

06:11.872 --> 06:21.844
also problems in terms of what involved to me 
integrity in government. I'd gone back under Mr.

06:22.305 --> 06:33.839
Crowther, who was director, who within a very 
short time frame was essentially removed as

06:22.305 --> 06:33.839
director of the thing. I was asked to take over the 
directorship, but in a manner that almost made it

06:39.428 --> 06:41.379
impossible for me to do that. Before Mr. Crowther 
was essentially fired, a high official under the

06:47.933 --> 06:56.501
Hickle regime came and asked me if I would take over 
the job if they would fire my boss, who was one of my

06:47.933 --> 06:56.501
very good friends. And, you know, if suddenly the 
job had been there and somebody said, Lee, will you

06:56.561 --> 07:05.669
come back and take this job, I probably would have 
taken the job. But for somebody to come in and say,

07:05.689 --> 07:15.838
you know, if I fire your friend, Mr. Crowther, you 
can further your career, put me in a very difficult

07:05.689 --> 07:15.838
position. And Because of other things I saw going 
down, I had a major run-in, a very interesting

07:18.207 --> 07:37.380
aspect of my career, with an assistant secretary 
for interior at that time named Dunn, whose wife

07:18.207 --> 07:37.380
was a cousin to President Nixon. and who came out to 
visit here in Seattle. I was out in Seattle. That

07:41.896 --> 07:45.722
was the time I was stationed in Washington, but I 
was out in Seattle. And I had gone down with some

07:46.483 --> 07:50.530
other people to meeting at the airport. And he'd 
been drinking and got off the plane and acted

07:51.672 --> 08:04.752
pretty much like I was his manservant, like 
telling me, go get my bags and deliver them to the

07:51.672 --> 08:04.752
hotel. I don't cotton to that thing very easily. 
And I told the secretary, well, if he wanted

08:06.662 --> 08:12.270
somebody to get his bags, he better get a 
manservant. Or he had better ask me, please, I'll

08:12.310 --> 08:15.815
help anybody carry his bag. I had to help the 
janitor carry his bag. But on the other hand, I

08:17.678 --> 08:25.168
don't want somebody coming and telling me, pick up 
my bag, boy, and I'll meet you at the hotel type of

08:17.678 --> 08:25.168
thing. So I came very close to being fired as a 
result of that. But I just hung it out. said that I

08:33.217 --> 08:35.139
wasn't going to apologize. And I felt that if there 
was any apology due, it was due to me. And

08:38.643 --> 08:47.313
ultimately, Mr. Hickel called me personally and 
asked me about that. And apparently, he and Mr.

08:47.733 --> 08:51.718
Dunn didn't get along too well together. I'm not 
sure about that. But anyway, I got a call from them.

08:56.707 --> 08:58.430
in essence, said, forget about the problem. And it 
was erased from the books. And very shortly after

09:00.172 --> 09:07.503
that, Mr. Pickle was resigned or removed, 
whatever one wants to look at that. And Mr. Dunn was

09:07.523 --> 09:10.107
removed from the department also. So that sort of 
trauma was over. But by the time that had happened,

09:12.831 --> 09:20.082
and I had this invitation to take over the job, and 
because of the various And I'll just call it

09:20.753 --> 09:26.499
political intrigue that I saw going on, even at 
middle management level in Washington. I decided

09:27.339 --> 09:34.607
at that time that I didn't want to have anything to 
do with it and asked to come back to Seattle. So my

09:34.647 --> 09:37.529
tenure there was relatively short. I did act as 
acting director for the department of Bureau of

09:37.589 --> 09:44.236
Commercial Fishery after Mr. Crowther left. I 
told the department people I would do that until

09:44.336 --> 09:49.461
such time as they found a replacement. for Mr. 
Crowther, and then I returned to Seattle. OK. And

09:55.022 --> 10:00.709
so you're really only there, best I can figure out 
from reading your vitae, you were really only

09:55.022 --> 10:00.709
there a year. Is that right? That's about right. 
And much of that, by the way, I was doing a lot of

10:02.251 --> 10:06.536
commuting between Seattle and Washington. So I 
guess an actual stay in Washington was closer to

10:06.576 --> 10:11.081
six months. So I washed out rather quickly. If one 
has a choice between DC and Seattle, there's no

10:15.467 --> 10:18.711
choice, believe me. Seattle's a lot better. So 
when you return back to Seattle now, I

10:20.407 --> 10:29.840
assume then you're simply transferred down here. 
Is this fair to say? I transferred back to a new slot

10:31.061 --> 10:41.355
they had set up, which was sort of an associate 
regional director for research. For resource

10:42.297 --> 10:44.119
planning, a resource program. title of it myself, 
but it was really for taking care of the research

10:45.550 --> 10:48.875
program. Okay, that's what I wanted to know. I 
wonder what you did, because that title implies

10:49.696 --> 10:52.420
nothing. Yeah, that is typical of many government 
titles. In essence, what it was is I was

10:55.024 --> 11:12.530
responsible for essentially coordinating the 
total research program in the region, developing

10:55.024 --> 11:12.530
the programs and designing the programs and 
working with the various, at that time, roughly

10:55.024 --> 11:12.530
five laboratory directors and putting the 
research program together here in the region.

11:12.870 --> 11:14.933
Okay, now, what kind of programs did you try to put 
together? Well, we had a whole range of them. At

11:17.236 --> 11:22.143
that time, sort of my horizons were broadened. I 
had to deal with marine mammal programs, research

11:22.223 --> 11:26.829
in marine mammals. I had to deal with our basic 
program in oceanography and fisheries

11:26.869 --> 11:31.536
oceanography. Here are high seas fisheries 
research. I had to deal with programs that still

11:34.661 --> 11:39.307
related to exploratory fishing, gear 
technology. So it was the whole gamut. of research

11:41.187 --> 11:52.684
in terms of the broad range of things you might 
think that we do under the broad umbrella of

11:41.187 --> 11:52.684
oceanography, from fisheries biology to 
physical oceanography to chemical

11:41.187 --> 11:52.684
oceanography. So designing programs throughout 
the North Pacific that dealt with the federal

11:53.965 --> 12:00.715
involvement in fisheries and oceanography.

12:02.686 --> 12:04.929
Did you have any long-range goal? Is that a fair 
question? When you came into the job, did you have

12:06.531 --> 12:10.757
something in mind that you wanted to accomplish? 
Into that particular job? Into that particular

12:11.819 --> 12:12.580
job. Yeah. I very much wanted to establish the 
so-called center concept that now exists in the

12:12.800 --> 12:18.328
United States. At that time, we had a whole series 
of fragmented labs throughout the US, each with an

12:18.368 --> 12:31.326
independent program and each one going its 
independent direction with a tremendous amount

12:18.368 --> 12:31.326
of overlapping programs between labs. And if you 
wanted an answer in terms of somebody's response,

12:31.627 --> 12:40.179
for example, what's the consequence of an oil 
spill in area X? Or what should our position be in

12:40.400 --> 12:48.792
terms of what's the technical information to 
develop a position for negotiating with Japan?

12:49.396 --> 12:55.767
You ended up having to run to five different labs 
that might have five different views because they

12:49.396 --> 12:55.767
were unconsolidated. They were independent, 
autonomous structures. And a great deal of

12:58.973 --> 13:04.502
overlap, in my view, waste of energy and funds in 
terms of an agency that has a pretty directed

13:04.837 --> 13:07.522
mission. You know, you can think of one thing if you 
want to run a university that way is quite

13:07.823 --> 13:24.195
different than running a government 
organization that has some direct applied types

13:07.823 --> 13:24.195
of information that must be developed on almost an 
annual basis in terms of response to basic

13:07.823 --> 13:24.195
problems that the government's confronted with. 
I didn't see that. I saw a waste of people were

13:26.696 --> 13:33.169
buying the same facilities and duplicate them. 
Each lab had the same number of Nansen bottles but

13:33.389 --> 13:38.520
was using them once a year for one crew. Each lab had 
and was trying to duplicate. None of the labs, by

13:42.085 --> 13:58.943
the way, were well essentially equipped in terms 
of the type of equipment that one needs to do

13:42.085 --> 13:58.943
science and the computer backup, the computer 
facilities, the electronic systems and things

13:42.085 --> 13:58.943
that are needed to be done. And I felt if we could 
aggregate these into a series of labs that would

13:58.963 --> 14:08.593
deal with science, not in telling this scientist 
what the hell he's going to produce, But in a sense,

14:08.573 --> 14:19.629
bringing together these people to develop an 
overall set of scientific programs within a

14:08.573 --> 14:19.629
region to be responsive to these regions. That 
one, we'd have the mass. One, we could attract

14:22.192 --> 14:29.182
better scientists because we could essentially 
develop better facilities in these particular

14:22.192 --> 14:29.182
institutions. So a lot of science won't go to a 
place where there aren't the appropriate

14:30.023 --> 14:35.692
facilities. It can be good living in Seattle. But 
if you haven't got a good electron microscope, I'm

14:38.223 --> 14:46.715
not going to get anybody that's interested in that 
particular field in this area, even if it's a big

14:38.223 --> 14:46.715
problem. And if I don't have the computer system 
for the people that are doing population dynamics

14:47.497 --> 14:57.571
and modeling to essentially use as a tool, they're 
going to go someplace where they can. And none of

14:58.072 --> 14:59.995
the labs could provide that. So the concept and 
goal was here is to collect these together into a

15:00.312 --> 15:15.451
set of major centers that would essentially have 
facilities much like many of the universities do

15:00.312 --> 15:15.451
so that we could attract damn good students coming 
out of universities. I see an awful lot of

15:15.551 --> 15:21.038
university people were turning right back to 
university in terms of careers. either into

15:21.018 --> 15:31.435
teaching or into various institutions the 
university would think, because they had the

15:21.018 --> 15:31.435
facilities, they had the environment that you 
couldn't generate in most of the government

15:21.018 --> 15:31.435
laboratories. And I guess that was one of my major 
goals. Along with my own interest, of course, as a

15:35.541 --> 15:45.237
scientist, I have always had a major interest in 
the area of animal population dynamics, and I've

15:35.541 --> 15:45.237
always felt that I have to have... at least 37% of my 
time to allocate to my own special interests.

15:49.633 --> 16:06.490
Because I have a very strong feeling about 
government scientists and that it's very easy to

15:49.633 --> 16:06.490
get in and become so caught up in administration 
that quite quickly you essentially come out of the

15:49.633 --> 16:06.490
scientific world. And then the real reason that 
you were put in there as a leader, because other

16:06.910 --> 16:15.038
scientists recognize you, other scientists 
would work for you, you lose. Because you're no

16:15.305 --> 16:17.769
longer a scientist. So I have really had a very 
strong dedication that I'm going to essentially

16:17.789 --> 16:34.655
continue in my own particular error and continue 
to publish in that error a sufficient amount so

16:17.789 --> 16:34.655
that I have that recognition and acceptance in 
terms of the scientific community. I'm not sure

16:36.218 --> 16:38.201
that happens in all government labs. I'm sure it 
does not. But I have felt as a personal conviction

16:41.731 --> 16:53.268
that that's one of my long-range goals is to always 
essentially be sufficiently alert to my own field

16:41.731 --> 16:53.268
that I am capable of publishing and writing in that 
field. That's great. I support that

16:54.731 --> 16:56.934
wholeheartedly. It's not easy to do. Not easy to 
do, right. If you're an administrator, I find it

17:00.259 --> 17:02.242
great. I find it difficult to understand how you 
find the time for that. Well, I guess... Like many

17:10.604 --> 17:20.534
of the people in the field, my sort of vacation even 
at home is taking a pen and relaxing and sitting

17:10.604 --> 17:20.534
down and working on a paper that I like. I don't do 
much writing in the office here anymore, but I

17:20.554 --> 17:28.501
still manage to get three to four papers a year and 
credible journals. And I guess I do 60% to 70% of

17:29.302 --> 17:33.166
that at home. And it's sort of a relaxation to me to 
be able to sit down at home pull some papers,

17:37.942 --> 17:45.292
particularly it gets me away from the day-to-day 
administrative problems. I think a lot of

17:45.513 --> 17:58.030
scientists end up in these things and really don't 
know what they're getting into, and then find out

17:45.513 --> 17:58.030
they're dealing with people and people problems, 
and they're sort of getting aced out of the whole

17:45.513 --> 17:58.030
area that they were trained for. I have a couple of 
specific technical questions I'd like to ask you.

18:09.464 --> 18:16.540
Now,

18:09.464 --> 18:16.540
deep sea trawlers is really what this concerns. 
What sort of technological changes do you think

18:17.302 --> 18:26.663
need to take place, if any, before you can draw 
better biological samples on deep sea trawlers?

18:28.027 --> 18:30.532
in terms of, are you talking about kind of 
research? Yeah, if you wanted to draw a

18:30.552 --> 18:37.324
representative sample of deep sea populations, 
for example, that's what many fisheries are now

18:30.552 --> 18:37.324
trying to do. And it seems, at least to us, that 
those of us on the outside that biologically, not a

18:42.623 --> 18:46.627
very good job is being done about that. Well, let's 
see. I think the best jobs is being done that one can

18:47.428 --> 18:54.855
do with deep sea trawls and deep sea nets of the type 
we have now. But you're quite correct.

18:57.718 --> 19:03.244
Interpreting what that really means is one hell of 
a problem. And in fact, this is going to be a

19:04.024 --> 19:08.749
scenario I've written on in a great deal, and this 
deals with what I like to call the coefficient of

19:09.016 --> 19:12.002
catchability of these things. For each species, 
it differs. For each species within different age

19:14.487 --> 19:18.175
groups, it differs. In other words, that net, even 
if the animal is in front of it, will take a

19:18.215 --> 19:24.207
different proportion of of three-year-olds and 
it will four-year-olds. One group is stronger,

19:26.830 --> 19:29.833
slightly average size. It'll differ between 
species because of their swimming capabilities

19:30.794 --> 19:37.801
and their avoidance responses, their behavioral 
responses. They have different behavioral

19:38.462 --> 19:39.964
patterns. So you get a conglomerate in what I call 
in terms of a net sample. Ultimately, and I think it

19:45.209 --> 19:49.333
addresses your question, really doesn't tell you 
a great deal about what was really there when the

19:49.820 --> 19:53.866
net went through. You know, how representative is 
that, and how well can you reconstruct the

19:54.526 --> 20:00.535
original population? And probably not very well, 
with the exception of, oh, I would say a half a dozen

20:00.955 --> 20:12.711
species that we're beginning to get a fairly good 
fix on the coefficient of catchability, at least

20:00.955 --> 20:12.711
for certain size groups. But even here, you know, 
it changes between seasons. The animals are more

20:15.816 --> 20:19.000
active during one season than another. They're 
more likely to be up off the bottom in one season

20:19.182 --> 20:23.989
than in another. They're more likely to be off the 
bottom at night than they are in the day. So it is one

20:28.475 --> 20:31.139
tremendous problem. And I guess what one is 
looking for and what we're shooting for down the

20:31.179 --> 20:44.378
line is the addition of electronic sensing 
equipment that not necessarily catches what's in

20:31.179 --> 20:44.378
front of the net. The concept of electrical trawls 
and things have been introduced. That perhaps

20:49.591 --> 20:53.497
will work out, but I see a whole set of problems that 
have generated that. I think it's more important

20:54.058 --> 21:05.217
to have some sort of remote instrumentation that 
really gives you a continuing fix on these set of

20:54.058 --> 21:05.217
coefficients that we have to deal with. I think 
this can be done to some extent acoustically now. I

21:09.964 --> 21:15.193
tell you, the people that are really taking a 
leadership role in this are the people over at

21:09.964 --> 21:15.193
Lowestoft England. who have various acoustical 
arrays that are essentially telling them how many

21:15.612 --> 21:26.301
of the fish that are in front of the net and over a 
certain path are ending up in the net. And they're

21:26.321 --> 21:27.765
doing this two ways. in terms of passive and direct 
acoustics. They've got very small acoustical

21:30.731 --> 21:38.800
devices now that they put on a number of fish that 
they capture, release back into the environment.

21:39.681 --> 21:40.943
Then they know where those fish are. They've 
spotted those fish. They can put the trawl down,

21:42.485 --> 21:51.495
and they can say, all right, there's 10 of those 
fish in front of my trawl, because they've got them

21:42.485 --> 21:51.495
acoustically on their array. And they pass the 
trawl through and say, we've got two of them. And

21:55.660 --> 21:58.123
then they go through and do that again, and they 
say, Well, on an average, the coefficient of

21:58.323 --> 22:08.522
catchability of this particular species at these 
particular size groups, and they're doing this

21:58.323 --> 22:08.522
during different seasons of the year, are about x. 
Now, that's a start, but it's a very tedious and

22:08.542 --> 22:13.411
costly way to go about it. Ultimately, I guess 
we're really going to have some sort of

22:13.531 --> 22:22.407
instrumentation that's reasonable in terms of 
cost that's going to essentially be scanning

22:13.531 --> 22:22.407
across the front of the sample the trawl net in 
terms of the path that's being sampled, and

22:22.387 --> 22:31.999
ultimately saying, you know, that you're losing X 
number of fish of X species. That's not going to be

22:32.440 --> 22:33.561
easy to do. I doubt if I see it, you know, in my 
lifetime. But I guess that's ultimately where

22:37.306 --> 22:42.673
you're going to have to go if you're going to use 
trawl sampling. Whether or not independent

22:43.075 --> 22:48.182
acoustical techniques ever get to that stage, I 
don't know. There's a real problem in the physics

22:48.222 --> 22:54.972
of essentially target identification. 
Detecting the animal is easy. And now even getting

22:57.435 --> 23:06.248
a good understanding of the size of that animal is 
relatively easy by the amount of energy that's

22:57.435 --> 23:06.248
returning from the target. and the 
characteristics of the blip. One knows pretty

23:09.299 --> 23:12.044
well it's a fish. It's a fish of this size. It's a 
fish with an air bladder. It's a fish without an air

23:15.852 --> 23:17.355
bladder. But still saying it is a cod, it is a black 
cod, it's a halibut, et cetera, we're a long way

23:17.897 --> 23:27.156
from that. They're working on that. And if that's 
ever overcome, then acoustical assessment could

23:28.426 --> 23:38.658
be a major technique that will improve our ability 
to assess the ocean resources.

23:41.201 --> 23:45.505
Well, that may well have answered the next 
question, which I was going to ask. And it seemed,

23:45.586 --> 23:56.738
when we looked at your papers, most of them are on 
such things as distribution, migration,

23:45.586 --> 23:56.738
systematics of ecology and growth of marine 
fishes.

23:59.401 --> 24:02.765
How should research be expanded into that area? I 
mean, given the unreliability of data, would

24:02.845 --> 24:11.416
acoustical soundings, is that what you suggest as 
the major development? I only bring acoustics

24:11.657 --> 24:18.225
forward as one new tool. But I think one has to be 
careful. I think reliance on any one tool is not an

24:19.667 --> 24:27.056
appropriate way for the scientists to go forward. 
I think we're going to have to continue with a wide

24:28.983 --> 24:45.883
variety of net sampling from everything from our 
standard one meter plankton nets to bongo nets to a

24:28.983 --> 24:45.883
variety of trawls and persains and craps and a 
whole range of sampling techniques. I think we'd

24:45.903 --> 24:53.151
like to broaden our direct observation through 
television

24:45.903 --> 24:53.151
and And I think we'll learn a lot from scuba divers. 
I don't think the use of scuba divers has been made

24:58.091 --> 25:04.337
as scientific as it should. It's been sort of a 
random set of observations and photography. I

25:08.661 --> 25:09.862
think that could be improved. But I think remote 
sensing and direct sensing are going to add a

25:09.882 --> 25:21.012
dimension between now and the end of the century 
that's far ahead of anything we've got. If you see

25:21.032 --> 25:22.193
some of the things that that are coming out and 
available to the people in the oil industry and can

25:22.797 --> 25:36.470
be termed and applied in terms of some of our 
problems in fisheries and fishery science,

25:22.797 --> 25:36.470
they'll add a great dimension to this. And I really 
think that where we're going, at least over the

25:36.490 --> 25:47.060
next 10 years, of course, is getting out of this 
sort of single fisheries or focus into really more

25:36.490 --> 25:47.060
into an ecosystem focus. And this then, of course, 
does demand you look across much broader range of

25:50.405 --> 25:52.167
animals. All right, now that's the next question. 
What management theories then are you leading to

25:54.550 --> 25:58.255
with these kinds of studies? And clearly you're 
leading to a management theory of an ecosystem.

26:00.838 --> 26:02.981
What is it? Okay, I want to be careful not to use 
jargon here. You know, everybody's talking about

26:06.425 --> 26:12.873
ecosystem management, and I think it's a very 
loose term at this point in our capabilities. When

26:14.235 --> 26:17.239
I sit down and talk to the marine mammal specialist 
who said, you know, you guys are wrong in

26:17.877 --> 26:20.881
fisheries. You need to get into ecosystem 
management. My answer is, you're right. Now,

26:26.528 --> 26:27.490
where do we go? Now, that's the question you answer 
me. If you turn around and say, what models do you

26:29.492 --> 26:33.437
have to tell us to do this? What set of observations 
do we have? Then, you know, we start to skate on

26:35.360 --> 26:39.485
pretty thin ice. We just don't have a hell of a lot of 
information in terms of good ecosystem concepts.

26:44.863 --> 26:51.129
Now, here at the center, I've got a special group 
that's working on ecosystem modeling for the

26:44.863 --> 26:51.129
Bering Sea. And it's the area probably have more 
data on a broader range of animals than any place in

26:51.690 --> 26:56.695
the world. We have good data on birds. We've got 
good data on marine mammals. We've got good data on

27:00.819 --> 27:03.682
the upper trophic level of fish. We've got good 
data on plankton, et cetera. Still, I think we're

27:06.785 --> 27:09.147
10 years away from a model that has adequate 
predictive capability to get into the day-to-day

27:10.038 --> 27:15.908
management process. The system is so dynamic, and 
we can measure so few things in the system at this

27:16.769 --> 27:24.342
time, that we're really just guessing. And I see a 
hell of a lot of guessing of, in the Antarctic,

27:24.903 --> 27:33.096
people are going to fish krill, and it's going to 
destroy the opportunity for the whales to come

27:24.903 --> 27:33.096
back. And I think a lot of this is is based on a high 
degree of emotionalism and also by the way i think

27:36.953 --> 28:03.771
it's a tactic to get money we sign issues all sorts 
of tactics to get money like everybody else and i

27:36.953 --> 28:03.771
just hope that the tactic and the emotionalism 
doesn't overrun our real capabilities in the

27:36.953 --> 28:03.771
field there is an opportunity in my view to do a much 
better management and job in management of our

27:36.953 --> 28:03.771
aquatic resources by taking an ecosystem 
approach but not taking one in a haphazard sense

28:04.055 --> 28:14.013
that says, I'm going to throw everything away I've 
done because really the single species approach

28:04.055 --> 28:14.013
really isn't very good, and now I'm going to go to an 
ecosystem. You know, it took us years to develop

28:14.654 --> 28:21.386
even some halfway reasonable data to manage 
single species. It's going to take us a long time

28:21.406 --> 28:26.535
before we really have reached the point where we 
can say, If we perturb this, this, and this, these

28:26.802 --> 28:39.510
are the likely consequences in the system, 
particularly when you've got so much noise in the

28:26.802 --> 28:39.510
environment that's having a tremendous 
influence on that complex itself. So I guess I go

28:40.131 --> 28:43.258
forward cautiously saying we must go there. But I 
think we have to do it in a very scientific way, and

28:43.745 --> 28:50.133
that we oughtn't to just discard a lot of what we 
already have. Because really, they represent the

28:50.213 --> 28:58.344
only tools we have probably in the short range to 
give some answers to managers. In five to 10 years,

28:58.944 --> 29:10.239
I think we will start to have models, at least in 
this part of the world, where we're looking at 25

28:58.944 --> 29:10.239
species at one time and looking at the 
interactions. We're building that now, but we're

29:10.339 --> 29:12.722
building towards it.
