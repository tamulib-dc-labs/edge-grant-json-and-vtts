00:03.777 --> 00:15.475
My name is Elizabeth and I'm here talking to Dr. 
Matney about Amtrak passenger service. Dr.

00:17.899 --> 00:25.430
Matney, can you tell me a little bit about your 
personal knowledge or your personal background

00:17.899 --> 00:25.430
with trains? Well, I became interested in 
passenger trains through our historical society

00:31.098 --> 01:00.160
here in Houston in the Gulf Coast chapter of the 
National Railway Historical Society back in 1970

00:31.098 --> 01:00.160
and became formally involved by joining that 
society and this was right at the at the tail end of

00:31.098 --> 01:00.160
the of the passenger service just prior to Amtrak 
and of course one developed a keen interest in the

01:01.034 --> 01:14.074
passenger service available because we have one 
or two cars in the society that we can pick on behind

01:01.034 --> 01:14.074
passenger trains and run. So if they 
discontinued, we wouldn't have any way to ride our

01:14.094 --> 01:20.203
cars. So we took a pretty keen interest in the 
passenger service back in those days. And then I

01:25.070 --> 01:28.375
gravitated from that to becoming more interested 
in trying to do something to help restore

01:28.878 --> 01:42.756
passenger service in the country, instead of 
sticking with the historical stuff like what's

01:28.878 --> 01:42.756
going on now and what can we do to help bring it 
about. And I soon heard about and joined the

01:43.937 --> 01:51.807
National Association of Railway Passengers. And 
it was the lobbying organization that gathers

01:56.941 --> 02:13.324
money from its membership and used it as a formal 
lobbying process for Congress and to get the

01:56.941 --> 02:13.324
enabling legislation drafted and passed and to 
create ANTRAC. It has been a very strong, had a very

02:14.987 --> 02:24.601
strong influence on the development of ANTRAC 
since ANTRAC's original law. ANTRAC, as you know,

02:27.130 --> 02:40.043
It's a government-developed organization which 
also includes private representation on its

02:27.130 --> 02:40.043
board of directors from the railroad industry 
itself. So it's a mixture of government and

02:40.723 --> 02:47.710
private

02:40.723 --> 02:47.710
leadership. Can you tell me who owns Amtrak? Well, 
it is a corporation. a supposed to be a profit

02:57.100 --> 03:02.069
corporation. And if they can ever run the trains 
and make a profit, I guess it'll turn into that. But

03:07.979 --> 03:13.228
the government is responsible for keeping it 
afloat. Not too unlikely to do some things like

03:14.671 --> 03:21.623
Chrysler and Boeing and other industries. When a 
company gets so large that it presents a national

03:22.379 --> 03:35.299
process that it goes out of business, well then it 
suddenly, as long as the company's making money,

03:22.379 --> 03:35.299
it's just great and it's a private enterprise. But 
if it's large enough and it begins to lose money,

03:36.441 --> 03:47.258
well then it becomes the sad duty of the federal 
government to keep bailing it out. I think that

03:47.278 --> 03:50.783
there's a companion A companion rail adventure 
that the government got into by necessity, which

03:52.484 --> 04:01.677
is related to Amtrak, and that's Conrail. Conrail 
started out by two huge railroads literally going

04:01.697 --> 04:14.476
bankrupt, the Penn Central and the New York, the 
Pennsylvania Railroad and the New York Central.

04:14.496 --> 04:15.758
About what time was this? Oh, this is back in the 
60s. And they...

04:22.893 --> 04:27.859
They merged into a Penn Central, and that's always 
a desperation. When two of them are in financial

04:27.879 --> 04:32.685
trouble, they get together just to amplify it. It 
doesn't really solve much. You've got to merge

04:34.728 --> 04:38.973
something that's losing with something that's 
winning in order to come out of how it was. At any

04:40.115 --> 04:45.682
rate, they merged and formed Penn Central, and 
that didn't work. And then the government... took

04:48.593 --> 05:04.353
over and established a thing called Conrail, 
which included, I think, six or seven railroads

04:48.593 --> 05:04.353
that were Title XI situations, you know, 
bankruptcy, and up in the Northeast. Now, they

05:05.875 --> 05:18.330
poured money into it, but it's very essential that 
they build up their tracks and their network and

05:05.875 --> 05:18.330
their systems on the main lines. And it's hard to 
believe, but Conrail is now making a profit. And I

05:25.259 --> 05:41.096
look in the future to Amtrak doing that and to get 
quickly to some of the issues that are really

05:25.259 --> 05:41.096
important in Amtrak's history. It has 
traditionally focused on two kinds of service.

05:49.647 --> 05:51.950
the Northeast, and everybody else. And everybody 
else is long-distance traffic. And it turns out

05:58.098 --> 06:06.068
that long-distance trains are the profit makers, 
not the losers. And in the beginning, it was

06:06.529 --> 06:10.934
thought to be just the opposite. And where you 
needed rail is where you had lots of people riding,

06:10.954 --> 06:17.623
even short distances. That was the initial 
thought. And the Northeast Corridor, where there

06:19.685 --> 06:33.790
are 26 trains each way each day from Washington to 
New York to Boston, was selected as the ideal

06:19.685 --> 06:33.790
corridor to develop. And they did develop it. But 
it has never been a profit-making thing. And in the

06:39.500 --> 06:43.988
beginning, Amtrak was literally set up to conduct 
a funeral service over the pastor's system and to

06:44.525 --> 07:03.091
sort of get it out of everybody's corporate hair 
and let it die a natural death and provide a good

06:44.525 --> 07:03.091
funereal service and bury the damn thing and get it 
out. But it seemed to revive, unfortunately, and

07:03.171 --> 07:08.698
it flourished a bit. And then the Northeast 
Corridor came in and they introduced the

07:09.640 --> 07:14.346
Metroliners and now they have some some i i think 
very fast trains are up in the 120 mile an hour

07:15.035 --> 07:38.410
category and stretches of that very fast but 
they're losing money because the distance that

07:15.035 --> 07:38.410
people travel the tickets they can't charge 
enough and be competitive with with buses and with

07:15.035 --> 07:38.410
the real uh cheap fare airline service. They have 
walk-on airline service between those major

07:42.020 --> 07:46.465
cities in the Northeast. You can just walk on an 
airliner and pay your $15 or whatever it is and go

07:46.485 --> 07:55.414
from Washington to New York. No reservations, no 
nothing. There's another airliner that will open

07:57.316 --> 08:04.464
its doors and you can board it 20 minutes later or 
whatever. So it's just a shuttle. That's the kind

08:06.487 --> 08:13.156
of fairs that you're in competition

08:06.487 --> 08:13.156
with. And it's kind of unfair because a lot of the 
airport, a lot of the airline's operations are

08:13.436 --> 08:22.508
government funded. All the people in the control 
towers, I guess you remember the controllers and

08:22.528 --> 08:29.878
their strike and all that kind of stuff. At any 
rate, I think we've got two completely different

08:30.483 --> 08:45.862
systems and two completely different sets of 
numbers to look at, and that's the long-distance

08:30.483 --> 08:45.862
trains, which are everything outside the 
northeast corner and the northeast corner. There

08:46.943 --> 08:55.393
are some short-distance trains in California 
that have been initiated and are running well. but

08:55.660 --> 09:01.748
their distances are slightly longer than the ones 
out there. To give you a good example, we're now

09:01.768 --> 09:12.523
thinking of changing the route structure of the 
Sunset Limit. This is a train that runs at all our

09:13.204 --> 09:24.199
good cheer behind many times from New Orleans to 
Houston to San Antonio to El Paso on out to Los

09:13.204 --> 09:24.199
Angeles. And the plan is to change that route both 
in time and where it goes. So it'll be an overnight

09:32.591 --> 09:36.275
train in each direction from New Orleans to 
Houston. And in Houston, it will go to Dallas via

09:36.736 --> 09:41.060
College Station. So you won't have to drive your 
Oldsmobile home anymore. You can get on that

09:46.406 --> 09:48.068
train. That would be more convenient. Wouldn't 
that be fun? Yeah. It'll go to Dallas, and then Fort

09:50.831 --> 09:54.675
Worth, and then Abilene, Midland, Odessa, and El 
Paso. San Antonio will continue to be served by the

10:00.467 --> 10:10.122
Eagle, which now goes to Austin and Fort Worth and 
Dallas and Texarkana and so on. Now, those trains

10:10.142 --> 10:12.826
will meet up there. And in addition to those two 
trains, which will have a meet in the Fort

10:12.846 --> 10:22.080
Worth-Dallas area every day in each direction, so 
you can ride up and go in either direction on the

10:12.846 --> 10:22.080
other trains, If you wanted to, there's going to be 
the reinitiation of the Lone Star from Fort Worth

10:22.718 --> 10:39.422
North to Oklahoma City, maybe Tulsa, and to Kansas 
City and Chicago. There's some question as to

10:39.943 --> 10:52.101
whether it'll go the old route and go up to Wichita 
and then Kansas City, or go over and connect to

10:39.943 --> 10:52.101
Tulsa. Now, the thing that's interesting about 
that is that people say, but you're disrupting the

10:52.537 --> 11:03.853
traffic between Houston and San Antonio. What 
kind of traffic do you have? That train gets to San

11:07.217 --> 11:14.768
Antonio now at 4 in the morning in one direction and 
6 in the other. So what kind of traffic are we

11:15.188 --> 11:18.853
interfering with at that time of morning? We're 
not. Plus the fact that you don't want to make it

11:20.009 --> 11:43.505
attractive for people to ride the train on short 
distances because if you've got a reserved train,

11:20.009 --> 11:43.505
it blocks people from getting through tickets to 
go a long distance if all the seats are occupied for

11:20.009 --> 11:43.505
100 miles or so or 200 miles or so by a bunch of people 
going from Houston to Dallas. You've got to have

11:43.525 --> 11:47.772
additional cars that you put on or you've got to 
have another section of the train to take to absorb

11:48.325 --> 11:51.749
that short traffic situation. When are they 
thinking about? Well, the next schedule change is

11:54.311 --> 12:04.362
April 29.

12:05.924 --> 12:10.709
But there's some grim news in this whole 
situation, too. They sent a test train down to run

12:10.769 --> 12:15.514
from Houston to Amtrak. from Houston to Dallas via 
College Station. And all that great thing was

12:21.231 --> 12:28.982
happening right in your backyard while you're 
going to school and you didn't understand what was

12:21.231 --> 12:28.982
happening. It took eight and a half hours for that 
train to get from Houston to Dallas. Why did it take

12:32.727 --> 12:33.869
eight and a half hours? Track conditions 
primarily. Now, I don't think city government

12:37.895 --> 12:45.045
should be left out of this thing either. They have a 
tendency to slap slow orders, ostensibly for

12:45.363 --> 13:02.702
safety, so that trains can't take possession of 
the grade crossing at speeds in excess of 25 miles

12:45.363 --> 13:02.702
an hour or something. They just can't do that 
anymore if we're going to have passengers. We

13:08.909 --> 13:12.012
can't afford to put an overpass or an underpass and 
replace all these crossings at grade level.

13:14.928 --> 13:17.211
There's just not enough money in the world. We've 
got something like 700 of them in Houston, which is

13:17.232 --> 13:24.343
more than several states have. And you can't do 
that. It's just not practical. So people, I think,

13:29.210 --> 13:33.818
are going to have to get used to trains running a lot 
faster. I would rather have them running faster.

13:36.322 --> 13:36.862
It's a lot more convenient. You see a freight. 
coming towards you, and you're in a car, and you're

13:38.080 --> 13:50.813
coming to a crossing, if that freight is barreling 
along at 45 miles an hour, I think you have a

13:38.080 --> 13:50.813
tendency to sit there and wait, because it's not 
going to take long for the freight to pass at that

13:38.080 --> 13:50.813
speed. But if it's creeping along at 15 to 20 to 25, 
your tendency is to think, hey, that's a long

13:50.833 --> 13:57.980
train. I'm going to be here five minutes waiting 
for that thing to go by at that speed. And you have a

14:02.345 --> 14:07.750
tendency to try to run the gate or get across in 
front of it if there is no speed. And I think it would

14:08.523 --> 14:12.106
be much safer. And Dallas apparently has just done 
that. They've stricken their ordinances that

14:15.209 --> 14:27.301
deal with the train speeds and the railroads and 
the federal government, which has to approve the

14:15.209 --> 14:27.301
track conditions. Certain speeds can be run with 
certain track conditions. The better the track,

14:31.945 --> 14:34.648
the higher the speeds, up to a point. if you have 
crossings there is a point which you can't go so it

14:35.101 --> 15:01.277
would make it much more reasonable to take strike 
out all those ordinances there are some little

14:35.101 --> 15:01.277
towns i don't know whether college bryan college 
station have local ordinances that that unduly

14:35.101 --> 15:01.277
restrict the speeds of trains going through there 
or not sure they don't have it you almost go right

14:35.101 --> 15:01.277
through that campus Just about. And some people 
get real alarmed if you're going to have a train

15:03.110 --> 15:08.736
that's going to go through there at 50 miles an 
hour. Of course, I think there would be enough

15:09.377 --> 15:18.648
passenger service there that the passenger 
trains, which are the ones that really want to

15:09.377 --> 15:18.648
speed up, are going to be stopping at the start. 
Yeah, I think you're right. I know that the campus

15:20.150 --> 15:26.117
spreads out across both sides of the track, though 
that might cause a problem. Well, we're trying,

15:27.093 --> 15:35.320
you know, in Texas to eventually come up with a 
triangle of good passenger service. And that

15:35.340 --> 15:44.889
would run from Houston to Dallas, Fort Worth, to 
San Antonio, to Houston, and be a triangle,

15:35.340 --> 15:44.889
actually. And to have good, high-speed trains 
that would service intermediate points. You

15:51.155 --> 15:57.100
know, we've got some large population centers in 
between the traffic to College Station, When

15:58.109 --> 16:04.042
certain ball games are going on, we ought to have 
special trains. Why should everybody get in their

16:04.062 --> 16:07.389
own car and drive up there? Just imagine how many 
people we could get to ride a train if you had

16:12.082 --> 16:16.728
special trains in Texas. The Longhorns are 
playing the Aggies at College Station. We've got,

16:21.153 --> 16:28.743
I don't know what the estimate is, 70,000 Texas X's 
that live in Houston. What about the train they

16:28.763 --> 16:33.188
were thinking about, the bullet train between 
Houston and Dallas? That's the one that is being

16:33.448 --> 16:41.278
planned by a private company and it's going to take 
quite a bit of financing because high-speed

16:41.765 --> 16:48.173
trains have to have isolated tracks. And they've 
got to get it up, and you can't have any deer ambling

16:49.734 --> 16:54.420
across or anything else. It's got to be completely 
isolated. And when you get into towns, it's

16:58.024 --> 17:05.533
usually elevated. And that train, the train 
they're thinking about is... which is the very

17:10.250 --> 17:23.267
high speed train that's made in France and is in 
operation in France now. And it's capable of

17:23.287 --> 17:33.000
speeds of around 200 miles an hour, so it's a very 
fast train. It would reduce train time to less than

17:33.453 --> 17:43.546
two hours from downtown Houston to downtown 
Dallas, for example. And that would mean

17:43.726 --> 17:47.371
time-wise that no one would fly anymore. Why would 
you fly if you're going from downtown Dallas? The

17:52.037 --> 17:58.465
problem with that reasoning is that you have to get 
to downtown to get onto the train. what kind of a how

17:58.883 --> 18:20.588
would you get down there and what would you do with 
what you've got down there with you know are you

17:58.883 --> 18:20.588
going to go down and have a big parking lot like we 
had out there i think the i think the training

17:58.883 --> 18:20.588
system of course one would one would argue well you 
get down there the same way that you get to the

17:58.883 --> 18:20.588
airport but i don't know if we had downtown parking 
that would satisfy like we have out of the airport.

18:26.726 --> 18:29.130
No, I think Houston won't require any station. 
Well, you're talking about the development of

18:29.150 --> 18:42.651
MTA, of the mass transit and buses and whatever 
they're going to put in to mobilize people so they

18:29.150 --> 18:42.651
don't have to jump in their car and go park it and go 
do something. So... Public transportation both

18:45.796 --> 18:57.016
at this end and Houston and that end and Dallas have 
to be improved to the point where you can do it and

18:45.796 --> 18:57.016
not worry about getting from your home to down 
there. What about recently when the mass

18:57.477 --> 19:04.469
transit... The rail plan. Yeah, the rail plan just 
got voted down. What about that? As a rail

19:09.725 --> 19:31.385
advocate, I guess I'm expected to say that I was 
bitterly disappointed, but I really wasn't

19:09.725 --> 19:31.385
because, first of all, I think that there are less 
expensive ways to build rail now that would be

19:09.725 --> 19:31.385
acceptable and rather attractive.

19:34.227 --> 19:37.470
They're going at it with heavy rail, and that is... 
That is very expensive, and I think light rail

19:37.788 --> 19:41.915
would have been better. The major difference 
between heavy rail and light rail is that heavy

19:42.135 --> 19:48.325
rail is electrical. They operate in trains that 
drive their power from the bottom. They're

19:51.671 --> 19:55.297
usually a third rail that feeds the electricity to 
the train. The light rail is an overhead

19:56.098 --> 20:01.146
electrical system.

20:01.987 --> 20:03.990
And it's much easier to put up. And the reason for 
that is if you can run light rail out on the ground,

20:04.070 --> 20:10.761
you can have grain crossings and all that, and your 
electricity is up in the air. If you've got it on the

20:11.703 --> 20:15.249
ground, you can't have a grain crossing. It would 
be electrocuted. So it's a much more expensive way

20:17.492 --> 20:22.000
to do it. The second reason that I wasn't too 
disappointed is that the rail line that they were

20:22.100 --> 20:27.589
planning didn't go anywhere. It went to some major 
shopping areas like Greenwood Plaza in downtown.

20:33.887 --> 20:38.800
And people were expected to feed in, presumably on 
buses which would connect to the train. You can't

20:39.702 --> 20:41.848
even get people to make a transfer We've got a very 
good bus service if you get down to it. We've got a 31

20:45.338 --> 20:57.798
bus that comes out here in our area, goes right down 
Gessner, half a block from where we're sitting,

20:45.338 --> 20:57.798
goes up to the Katy Freeway, gets on the Katy 
Freeway, has the express all the way downtown.

20:57.898 --> 20:59.842
It'll outrun me if I'm in my car. Get downtown, now I 
transfer. And I transfer to the number seven bus

21:02.966 --> 21:06.452
that goes out to the medical center. But I'm like 
most other people. That transfer is time

21:08.947 --> 21:11.170
consuming. And you get on a bus up here where you've 
got a seat all the way to town. Then you get on

21:15.095 --> 21:21.684
something down there, and you're standing all the 
way to the medical center in rush hour times. And

21:21.704 --> 21:22.946
it's ridiculous. So people aren't going to do 
that. What they needed to do was to set up this thing

21:26.871 --> 21:36.945
so that it connected major areas in town with the 
airports. so that there would be absolutely no

21:37.651 --> 21:46.924
reason as to why you would really have to drive your 
car to the airport. You could get on this thing at

21:46.985 --> 21:51.151
many different points in town. You could get on one 
branch of it that went out to the Astrodome Medical

21:52.392 --> 22:02.327
Center and another branch in Greenway Plaza and 
all those places over there. And they would

22:03.288 --> 22:05.211
connect downtown. go out to Hobby in one direction 
and go to Intercontinental in one direction and

22:05.275 --> 22:12.322
Hobby in the other. And be high speed so that you 
would just have a few stations to get on that thing.

22:19.969 --> 22:22.672
Not a stop every two blocks like they were 
designing. Because that destroys the purpose of

22:23.132 --> 22:26.936
it also. So their traffic plan was ridiculous. 
They should have maybe A station out in the

22:34.047 --> 22:42.923
Astrodome area, another one in the medical 
center, and nothing until you get downtown.

22:44.866 --> 22:47.971
They should have a Greenway Plaza, and what's the 
other one? I'm always forgetting. A big shopping

22:48.452 --> 22:51.918
center that's out beyond it. Anyway, those two, 
and then downtown. forget all this intermediate

22:57.487 --> 22:59.089
stuff. You get from intermediate distances by bus 
or some other way. Do you think that MARC can have

23:03.874 --> 23:08.839
any impact on that, on the local scene? I think we 
have to because

23:09.580 --> 23:23.554
it's precisely the development of those kind of 
systems which would intermash with getting our

23:09.580 --> 23:23.554
high-speed train service to Dallas. We have to 
have a way of collecting people and getting them to

23:27.035 --> 23:32.063
the station and doing it fast. Speed is a critical 
thing, not really cost as much as it is how much time

23:32.083 --> 23:38.813
it takes. And if you can reduce the time, if you had a 
public transportation system that could get you

23:39.735 --> 23:48.028
to work faster than you can drive it, which way 
would you go? Or go the fastest way. That's right.

23:50.592 --> 23:51.253
And if you were... literally guaranteed a seat 
with a reading light so that you could do something

23:51.470 --> 24:00.824
in transit besides stand up and hold on to 
something and be jostling around. There'd be no

24:01.085 --> 24:02.427
question, right? So that's what we've got to move 
forward, I think, towards. People are interested

24:08.576 --> 24:18.591
in service and convenience, and I think more than 
the actual cost, cost is important. People are

24:19.195 --> 24:23.420
willing to pay a good price for a premium service. 
What about the service up in the northeastern part

24:23.440 --> 24:26.885
of the country? They have the shuttle between 
Washington, D.C. and New York. Do businessmen...

24:32.332 --> 24:34.575
In the airlines you're talking about, or I don't 
know if my name is correct. In the rail service.

24:36.057 --> 24:36.657
Rail service. This is the northeast part of it. 
Right. And it's... There are... The last time I

24:41.644 --> 24:45.709
counted the schedule, they're from... trains 
from Washington, D.C. to New York, there were 26

24:47.680 --> 24:55.868
trains. Well, let me put it this way. In Baltimore, 
there are 26 trains each way, Amtrak trains, that

24:57.449 --> 25:06.038
go through Baltimore in each direction each day. 
Now, they don't all go all the way to New York. I

25:08.220 --> 25:11.323
think there's one or two that stop in 
Philadelphia. Are these mainly used by the

25:11.343 --> 25:14.025
businessmen commuting? That's right. That's 
right. Okay. Is most of the business then with the

25:17.997 --> 25:29.498
businessmen, the daily traffic with them, or is it 
with the long excursion trips that used to be so

25:17.997 --> 25:29.498
popular, the cross-country vacations? Well, 
we're back to our two different Amtrak systems.

25:34.929 --> 25:38.916
The northeast corridor is mainly... people that 
need to go short distances. The number of those

25:41.855 --> 26:05.983
that have been on a long-distance train like the 
Crescent that have come all the way from New

25:41.855 --> 26:05.983
Orleans to Washington, D.C., and are now 
continuing to New York as their last leg of their

25:41.855 --> 26:05.983
long-distance trip would be a very small 
percentage of the total passengers that ride from

25:41.855 --> 26:05.983
Washington to New York. The long-distance 
trains, virtually all the people that are on that

26:07.887 --> 26:18.417
are going a long distance.

26:18.437 --> 26:30.488
The people that used to board are Lone Star that 
left here and went to Dallas and then on up

26:18.437 --> 26:30.488
to Chicago. That train, most of the money, the 
revenue that came in, to that train, an

26:37.807 --> 26:48.458
overwhelming amount, maybe 80% of the total 
dollars that were spent on tickets in Houston were

26:37.807 --> 26:48.458
for Chicago and Leon. So people are riding the 
longer distance on those trains, that's right.

26:54.545 --> 26:58.128
Then is there more to future in the long distance 
traveling? Yes, I think there isn't any question

26:58.149 --> 27:00.711
about it. I think we could fill just about 
anything, if we got this new roof structure that I

27:02.798 --> 27:12.671
told you about here in Texas, and if it were to 
become daily, they haven't yet got that idea.

27:12.691 --> 27:13.952
They're still tri-weekly. But if that were a daily 
service, boy, oh, boy, I just think it would really

27:14.293 --> 27:23.905
be nice. And it's not so attractive for you to ride 
from College Station to Houston. And the reason

27:31.823 --> 27:37.733
for that is that you're going to run into slow 
orders when you get way outside of Houston. In the

27:37.754 --> 27:40.639
last 35 miles, you're going to be going 20. And it's 
going to take hours, and then you're going to have

27:41.420 --> 27:48.112
to go all the way downtown, and then you're going to 
have to come all the way back out here. So, you know,

27:48.432 --> 27:53.241
it's not that attractive for the short distance. 
It will never be that attractive for the short

27:53.963 --> 28:01.053
distances until you get the high-speed rail where 
you get them isolated. But long distance, that'll

28:01.073 --> 28:06.861
be a beautiful way to go to Chicago. It's so nice to 
get on a train and have some things to do, like write

28:06.881 --> 28:17.456
a report up like you're taping now and not have 
anybody disturb you. You can be in the air a little

28:18.497 --> 28:19.819
longer. sleeping room and stay there all day. So 
you can come out and talk to people. You can go to the

28:26.473 --> 28:28.916
dining party. It's a class act. I want to ask about 
some of the services that Amtrak has changed over

28:31.539 --> 28:37.647
the years. I know they took the dining car off for a 
while, and I think they've put it back on. The

28:43.835 --> 28:48.861
dining service has, first of all, when Amtrak The 
Southern Pacific has always tried to go out of the

28:50.798 --> 28:58.894
passenger business, and there wasn't any doubt 
about it. So at

28:58.914 --> 29:10.658
one time, they wanted to go out of business so they 
could follow around. How can we discourage people

29:10.678 --> 29:12.722
from riding? Well, we have a daily train and we're 
obligated to run a daily train in those days. So

29:18.590 --> 29:32.283
what they did was to take the dining car off and put 
in a coin-operated eating cart where you had the

29:18.590 --> 29:32.283
machines that dispersed to different things just 
like you'd have in your dorm. You've probably got

29:32.303 --> 29:40.971
some room that's got Coke machines and sandwich 
machines and cookie machines and candy machines

29:32.303 --> 29:40.971
and cigarette machines and all that junk. So you 
can go in with your pocket full of quarters and get

29:41.727 --> 29:47.273
whatever you're going to get out of these things. 
It's ridiculous. And then they said, aha. Now, if

29:52.439 --> 29:58.185
you'll let us go try weekly, we'll put first class 
service back on. Because this is a

29:58.205 --> 30:00.007
transcontinental train. So the ICC said, gosh, 
that's a great idea you have. So now we lose our

30:07.293 --> 30:12.341
daily service, but we get our dining car back and 
our sleeping cars. There weren't anything but

30:13.102 --> 30:15.967
chair cars on that thing. Does that help? All the 
way from New Orleans to Los Angeles on the chair car

30:16.888 --> 30:20.915
with Clint operating. Boy, the Southern Pacific 
has really got vision. I'll tell you. So now they

30:24.941 --> 30:31.291
put the dining car back on and they ran their train 
tri-weekly. Then the Southern thinking, ah.

30:34.040 --> 30:34.921
They're tri-weekly. We will go tri-weekly. So the 
Crescent went tri-weekly and met, you know, had

30:36.103 --> 30:42.551
meets in New Orleans on a tri-weekly basis. And it 
was, it's, the tri-weekly service is really the

30:43.632 --> 30:51.262
death knell of everything. You just, no one is 
adjusted to, when does the train run? Right. I've

30:57.445 --> 31:01.212
got to go to a meeting, and I've got to be in 
Washington on Monday morning. When does the train

31:01.332 --> 31:02.815
arrive? When can I leave Houston to get there? And 
if you don't have daily service, you're probably

31:06.062 --> 31:12.975
going to wind up there a day ahead of time, and no 
one's going to do it. Or else you'll take the plane.

31:14.718 --> 31:16.401
Or you're going to take an alternate. That's it.
