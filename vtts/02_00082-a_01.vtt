00:02.866 --> 00:06.312
Testing, testing, testing, one, two, three, four.

00:07.474 --> 00:10.740
Testing, one, two, three, four.

00:10.760 --> 00:12.924
This is Monday, December 18.

00:13.004 --> 00:14.867
We're in the Evans Library.

00:15.769 --> 00:23.322
And I have the honor of trying to pick up my microphone first.

00:23.673 --> 00:27.358
I have the honor of chatting with Dr. Greg Garcia.

00:27.478 --> 00:29.001
No, not Dr., just Greg.

00:29.361 --> 00:39.235
Greg Garcia about his experiences as a member of the student body here, class of 62.

00:39.255 --> 00:49.410
Greg, to introduce yourself to the listener of this tape or the reader of the transcript,

00:50.082 --> 00:58.969
please begin by describing family background, where did you grow up, where did you go to high school, what did your family do, that sort of thing.

00:58.989 --> 01:00.092
Okay.

01:00.781 --> 01:02.023
My name is Greg Garcia.

01:02.143 --> 01:05.947
Actually, Gregory A. Garcia is the name.

01:07.930 --> 01:13.196
Born May 28, 1940, in San Antonio, Texas.

01:13.957 --> 01:14.678
Born and raised.

01:15.279 --> 01:17.141
Still live in San Antonio at this time.

01:18.623 --> 01:21.667
My parents were immigrants from Mexico.

01:22.989 --> 01:30.518
They came to Texas right after one family in the middle of the Revolutionary War.

01:31.477 --> 01:41.954
the other family right toward the end of the Revolutionary War and they were, do you want to like their names?

01:41.974 --> 01:42.435
It doesn't matter.

01:42.455 --> 01:43.857
It doesn't matter.

01:45.119 --> 01:53.653
They actually came into this country in 1916.

01:54.595 --> 01:56.257
and the other family in 1924.

02:00.103 --> 02:20.090
Being that my mother's parents were landowners in Mexico and they lost the land during the Revolution, they moved to Texas and not being able to communicate in the English language, they had to work different types of jobs and most of them were in the migrant area.

02:21.713 --> 02:23.455
My father's family

02:23.654 --> 02:25.976
pretty much the same when they came into the country.

02:26.837 --> 02:37.027
Eventually they learned how to speak the language, you know, by process, and they also did a lot of migrant work all over the state of Texas, all the way across to Mississippi.

02:38.648 --> 02:43.353
And unfortunately, I never met my grandfather on my father's side.

02:43.393 --> 02:50.860
He was killed in a car accident in 1924 in San Antonio, and so my dad at that time was

02:51.599 --> 02:58.311
in middle school, and he had to quit school to help with the family obligations.

02:58.651 --> 03:07.887
And so he worked, I would say he had gone away to the eighth grade at that time, or reached the eighth grade.

03:08.508 --> 03:16.895
And so he had helped my grandmother, who lived to the ripe age of about 80.

03:17.896 --> 03:25.183
And so he worked in all kinds of jobs.

03:25.423 --> 03:29.947
Eventually he decided that he was going to, he needed to learn a trade, which he did.

03:30.007 --> 03:34.491
He was very much, was very good with his manual dexterity, was great.

03:34.511 --> 03:37.654
And my dad's a very intelligent person.

03:38.343 --> 03:44.111
learned by going to libraries and picked up the trade as a machinist.

03:45.293 --> 04:05.802
And so he worked in machine shops, starting at the bottom as a helper and on the way up, and subscribed to all kinds of trade journals and learned the trade, became a master machinist at a point in time, which he was very good at.

04:06.592 --> 04:14.325
He went to work for some great Aggies in 1941, I think it was.

04:15.186 --> 04:23.020
He went to work for Polly Kruger, which at that time he owned this company called San Antonio Machine and Supply Company.

04:24.322 --> 04:30.372
And, of course, all the Krugers were very nice people and they took my father under their wing and they

04:31.094 --> 04:38.464
They developed his trade, and he became one, actually, the assistant foreman in the machine shop there after a period of time.

04:38.484 --> 04:40.186
Worked for them for like 25 years.

04:41.288 --> 04:43.911
And so he was very, very familiar with all the Krugers.

04:43.951 --> 04:45.193
We knew all the Krugers.

04:45.213 --> 04:50.440
We used to go to their house during the Christmas holidays and visit with them.

04:50.500 --> 04:56.308
And my dad would go over there and put all their lights around the house, and then we'd stay around there.

04:57.109 --> 04:58.671
And Polly was a great man.

04:59.478 --> 05:08.110
There was also Walter Krueger, which I think he was an Aggie, Alex, Alfred, and those other three gentlemen in particular.

05:09.492 --> 05:17.483
I went to public school first six years of my education.

05:17.503 --> 05:26.295
I did not know how to speak English when I started first grade, and so it was a difficult process.

05:26.562 --> 05:32.856
With the help of my brother and my sister, I was able to survive and learn how to speak the language.

05:33.758 --> 05:38.648
And so for the first six years I attended a school in San Antonio which was called David Crockett Elementary.

05:39.404 --> 05:41.668
My brother had gone to a public school.

05:41.688 --> 05:43.771
My sister had gone to public high school.

05:44.292 --> 05:48.399
They're approximately, I think my brother's about ten years older than I am.

05:48.459 --> 05:50.443
My sister's about six or seven years older than I am.

05:51.505 --> 05:53.688
And so actually they were way ahead.

05:54.810 --> 06:01.682
But in a sense, it worked out real well for me because since I was the youngest, they always made sure that I was taken care of.

06:02.152 --> 06:15.066
Because my parents at times, since they felt uncomfortable in communicating in the English language, my brother or my sister would be the spokesperson whenever I needed some assistance or help.

06:15.086 --> 06:29.222
And at the end of the sixth grade, my mother and my father felt that for me to progress and probably continue and go into higher education, that I needed to

06:31.210 --> 06:39.222
to go to a school that would probably give me that opportunity or teach me so I could go into higher education.

06:39.723 --> 06:43.188
So my mother and father decided that they would send me to Central Catholic.

06:43.849 --> 06:46.193
Central Catholic at that time had seventh and eighth grade.

06:47.334 --> 06:49.017
So I'm really dating myself here.

06:49.037 --> 06:51.881
So I went to Central Catholic.

06:52.021 --> 06:57.690
I was not happy about going there because all my friends that were at the elementary school all went to

06:58.160 --> 07:03.664
the junior high in the area, and then they were all going to go to the high school that I anticipated I was going to go to.

07:04.117 --> 07:08.643
I told my parents, well, I'll go for, you know, the seventh, eighth grade, ninth grade.

07:08.663 --> 07:11.507
I'd like to catch up with my friends or tenth grade.

07:12.248 --> 07:15.412
Well, as it is, you know, you get comfortable in the situation.

07:15.472 --> 07:18.536
So I stayed at Central Catholic.

07:18.556 --> 07:24.384
So when I completed the eighth grade, I was very comfortable, so I stayed there.

07:25.245 --> 07:32.335
And Central Catholic at that time was pretty diverse, pretty diverse student body.

07:32.787 --> 07:36.491
And everyone seemed to get along real well.

07:36.511 --> 07:41.535
Of course, it was a very strict discipline because of the brothers and then the priests that were there.

07:41.635 --> 07:47.941
But anyway, completed my four years at Central Catholic.

07:48.282 --> 07:51.945
Well, actually six years because I was seventh, eighth, and then high school.

07:51.965 --> 07:55.789
And wound up, applied to A&M.

07:56.229 --> 07:57.070
All right.

07:57.771 --> 07:58.952
You finished high school what year?

07:59.292 --> 07:59.572
1958.

08:00.633 --> 08:02.355
About how many in the senior class?

08:02.588 --> 08:05.791
There was 170 I think at that time.

08:05.811 --> 08:09.896
Central Catholic was a lot larger, a lot bigger school.

08:09.916 --> 08:12.118
Enrollment was a lot higher than what it is today.

08:13.400 --> 08:20.888
Our senior, our student body when I was there was like 900 students.

08:20.988 --> 08:25.693
Today it's like about 500.

08:27.884 --> 08:35.555
The reason I think it was so, the enrollment was so large was the fact that we had transition period, seventh, eighth, you know, they kept moving up.

08:35.615 --> 08:49.156
And so I think two years after I went up to, when I was a sophomore, junior in high school, that was the last group of seventh and eighth graders that they had at that time.

08:49.176 --> 08:50.638
So yeah, I graduated in 58.

08:51.599 --> 08:52.961
You said you applied to A&M.

08:53.382 --> 08:55.545
What did you know about A&M

08:56.437 --> 08:59.403
before you decided to come here.

08:59.643 --> 09:00.926
How did you hear about A&M?

09:02.790 --> 09:07.980
I heard about A&M through my father and Polly Kruger and the Krugers.

09:08.561 --> 09:15.475
And then all the engineers that worked there at SAM School were all A&M graduates.

09:15.657 --> 09:22.584
And my dad's boss' son, his foreman, his son was an A&M graduate.

09:22.685 --> 09:27.950
So my dad felt that this is where I needed to go to school.

09:27.970 --> 09:30.052
My mother was not in favor of it, period.

09:30.573 --> 09:33.836
But my dad said, I want you to go to A&M.

09:33.856 --> 09:35.098
I want you to apply at A&M.

09:36.099 --> 09:41.625
And I remember, I guess since I was five or six years old, he already had that in his mind.

09:42.185 --> 09:44.668
And he was relaying that to me.

09:44.834 --> 09:51.804
And I remember sitting at home with him, and we would listen to the football games on the radio.

09:53.286 --> 09:59.454
In particular, like, later on when I got a little older, like when I was 10 and 11, I started realizing what he's trying to get across to me.

10:00.316 --> 10:04.902
And because I remember some of the football players from those days,

10:04.882 --> 10:18.078
Bob Smith, I remember that name, I remember, oh, there's so many of them, I'm just blank right now, but there was, I just started following the A&M, the school itself, never been here.

10:19.440 --> 10:21.182
I had never come up to the campus.

10:22.224 --> 10:29.893
I actually only came up to the campus one time before my freshman year, and that was when I applied.

10:30.599 --> 10:39.837
and they sent a letter back asking me to come up, and they had their battery of testing that it was a two-day situation.

10:40.217 --> 10:47.852
It was a Friday and a Saturday, I remember that, and they put us in the dorm, and they tried to make it sound like it was a great place to come to school.

10:48.253 --> 10:51.679
I never anticipated what the Corps was all about at that time, but anyway.

10:52.115 --> 10:59.684
I remember the two days we were here in the dining halls, we used to call them mess halls, and it seemed okay.

10:59.984 --> 11:04.269
It wasn't the most fabulous place in the world but I felt comfortable.

11:05.090 --> 11:06.091
You came up in the car.

11:06.252 --> 11:07.353
Yeah I came up in the car.

11:07.613 --> 11:16.424
Another Central graduate, his last name was Garza, Frank was his first name.

11:16.464 --> 11:21.109
And Frank Garza and I drove up.

11:21.292 --> 11:23.635
And we spent the Friday here.

11:23.695 --> 11:27.881
We came up really early that Friday and spent that Friday here and then half day on Saturday.

11:28.823 --> 11:31.286
And so we took all the tests that they gave us.

11:31.346 --> 11:35.332
And then we went back and they said they'd let us know what the results were.

11:35.372 --> 11:42.942
So about a month later or so we received notification that we were admitted to report at a certain time.

11:43.102 --> 11:45.286
There was no come back up and all that.

11:45.426 --> 11:46.607
Just come over here.

11:47.028 --> 11:47.729
Here's a form.

11:47.809 --> 11:48.410
Fill it out.

11:48.550 --> 11:49.011
You're coming.

11:49.031 --> 11:49.932
You're coming.

11:50.080 --> 11:54.425
If you want to be enrolled, what do you prefer, Army, Air Force?

11:54.445 --> 11:56.327
And you checked off.

11:56.347 --> 11:57.788
And who do you prefer as a roommate?

11:57.828 --> 11:58.589
And you checked off.

11:59.310 --> 12:01.573
And actually, you had a roommate.

12:01.593 --> 12:08.320
We had, if I'm not mistaken, I think it was either 12 or 13 Central Catholic graduates that came up.

12:08.340 --> 12:19.412
Of course, even back then in those days, the Central Catholic graduates that left would come back and talk to us about coming up to A&M or enrolling at A&M.

12:19.713 --> 12:20.615
And so we did.

12:21.036 --> 12:23.260
I mean, it was about 12 or 13 out of us.

12:23.321 --> 12:24.703
That was 170, which wasn't bad.

12:24.724 --> 12:25.565
You know, it was pretty good.

12:26.507 --> 12:34.003
And fortunately, I can say that of that 12 or 13 that were here, one of them transferred to TU.

12:36.208 --> 12:40.236
But even after he transferred, he would come back and say, you know, my heart's here.

12:40.840 --> 12:45.464
for whatever reasons that he transferred to Texas, and that was, you know, why he did it.

12:45.504 --> 12:49.367
And the rest of us, one of them didn't make it.

12:49.527 --> 12:53.330
I think he completed two years, and the rest of us graduated from A&M.

12:53.951 --> 12:57.034
So we were kind of, we kind of stayed close together.

12:57.554 --> 12:57.934
Oh, that's correct.

12:57.954 --> 13:07.963
And I don't know what happened to a lot of those high school buddies and, well, my Aggie buddies then, but there's one or two that I still stay in touch with.

13:08.443 --> 13:10.645
When you came up to enroll,

13:11.536 --> 13:15.254
Did you come in, did your parents bring you or did you come with a group or what?

13:15.274 --> 13:16.460
No.

13:16.942 --> 13:19.133
My father and my brother brought me up.

13:19.568 --> 13:24.114
What did you bring in the way of belongings when you came to enroll?

13:24.134 --> 13:24.695
The Foot Locker.

13:26.217 --> 13:27.639
Where'd you get the Foot Locker?

13:28.020 --> 13:30.463
Academy Army Surplus in San Antonio.

13:31.064 --> 13:43.922
It was, I still remember, it was a navy blue Foot Locker with gold trim, which is what they, since I was going to the Air Force, they asked to get a navy blue one or a blue one or whatever.

13:44.611 --> 13:46.775
They brought me up the day that I had to report.

13:46.795 --> 13:48.137
They came up.

13:48.157 --> 13:49.499
We only had one car in the family.

13:52.244 --> 13:57.072
My brother had just gotten out of the Air Force.

13:57.092 --> 14:03.463
As a matter of fact, he had been out of the Air Force and he was married already.

14:03.916 --> 14:05.278
We came up early in the morning.

14:05.338 --> 14:08.163
I had to be here at mid-morning sometime.

14:08.764 --> 14:14.813
And so when I came in, the first thing they told us to do, they kind of had a schedule for us.

14:15.454 --> 14:20.663
Go to a certain place on the campus and get some kind of a card.

14:20.723 --> 14:25.170
And then from that, you go to get fitted for uniforms.

14:25.250 --> 14:26.893
And so you follow the process.

14:26.953 --> 14:30.278
So about, I'd say, lunchtime.

14:31.456 --> 14:36.262
wound up back at the dorm where my outfit was and I had no idea what it was.

14:36.322 --> 14:50.278
I just knew that I was to report to a certain dorm and so my brother and my father took the footlocker out, went up to the dorm and so the CO happened to be out in the hallway when we came in.

14:51.480 --> 14:55.945
He was from San Antonio, I still remember his name, Johnny Gatlin.

14:56.617 --> 15:04.385
He greeted us, and then my dad said, well, we're going to leave him here, but we'd like to have lunch with him.

15:05.487 --> 15:07.749
And before we go, is that all right?

15:08.330 --> 15:10.332
He said, of course, go on, you know.

15:10.912 --> 15:17.199
And so he said, the student center's right up two blocks from the dorm area, and you'll probably get a pretty good meal there.

15:17.279 --> 15:20.683
So we went over there, had lunch, and then they brought me back.

15:21.423 --> 15:24.235
and dropped me off and said, we'll see you later.

15:25.360 --> 15:29.678
And not knowing that when I was gonna go back home,

15:29.962 --> 15:40.293
But the CEO at that time mentioned to them that we would be going through our freshman week training, and that on that Friday they would let us go home before the sophomores showed up the next week.

15:41.233 --> 15:45.938
So it was a rude awakening.

15:49.222 --> 15:51.484
There was not a fish camp then, was there?

15:52.044 --> 15:52.305
No.

15:53.606 --> 15:56.509
Describe that week.

15:56.860 --> 16:08.080
I felt that I was ready for A&M in the sense that when I was at Central Catholic, I had been very involved in the ROTC program there, which they've always had an excellent program.

16:09.162 --> 16:16.455
I had gone through the ranks at Central Catholic and attained the rank of Lieutenant Colonel.

16:16.435 --> 16:21.020
executive corps commander of the corps at Central Catholic.

16:21.080 --> 16:29.671
At that time, the group was about 300 in the ROTC unit there, and so I felt I was ready, you know, and I came up here.

16:29.711 --> 16:34.076
I mean, I can do anything these guys want me to do, and it didn't take me long.

16:34.136 --> 16:44.468
As soon as my dad and my brother left, I went to my room, and here walks in the first sergeant.

16:45.848 --> 16:54.345
And he tells me to get up against the wall, wants to see 13 wrinkles in my chin.

16:54.365 --> 16:58.473
I was kind of chunky, but I wasn't going to be able to do that.

16:59.455 --> 17:03.423
So he started telling me what he expected.

17:03.924 --> 17:04.806
I still remember his name.

17:05.808 --> 17:06.810
His last name was Lee.

17:08.123 --> 17:10.229
And as far as I knew, his first name was Sergeant.

17:11.111 --> 17:12.054
He's the first sergeant.

17:12.716 --> 17:13.137
Bob Lee.

17:13.217 --> 17:14.180
His first name was Bob.

17:14.942 --> 17:17.950
And he was from California, Van Nuys, California.

17:17.970 --> 17:18.712
I'll never forget that.

17:19.414 --> 17:21.981
He's a pretty fair individual.

17:22.973 --> 17:37.918
let me know exactly what was expected of me as a fish, that I no longer had my first name, that I was a fish, and that was my name, and that I had no privileges, I was scum of the earth, the whole thing.

17:38.539 --> 17:44.188
Just gave it to you in about 15 minutes.

17:44.405 --> 17:50.182
I looked at everything that I had, my shoes, and he said, those shoes need to be polished, yadda yadda yadda.

17:50.604 --> 17:51.225
You need a haircut?

17:51.246 --> 17:52.509
I thought I had a pretty short haircut.

17:52.529 --> 17:54.094
He said, no, you need to get a haircut.

17:54.631 --> 18:01.980
And after he lectured me and never did he, you know, what I would say, physically haze me.

18:02.401 --> 18:06.986
You know, a lot of people have the misconception that they did those kind of things.

18:07.026 --> 18:09.089
He just talked to me.

18:09.249 --> 18:16.258
You know, discipline was the main thing, I guess, trying to put discipline or telling me what discipline was and what A&M, what it was here.

18:16.298 --> 18:24.368
After we completed that, which was about, I said, about 15 minutes, he says, I'm going to Northgate.

18:26.018 --> 18:29.627
And he says, I see you have all your uniforms already.

18:31.291 --> 18:32.894
You need to take them to a cleaners.

18:33.676 --> 18:35.000
There's a few up at Northgate.

18:35.661 --> 18:38.548
I'll take you up to where I take my uniforms.

18:39.190 --> 18:44.382
And they have to have, you have to have those uniforms ready to wear on Thursday morning for a fit.

18:44.362 --> 18:46.024
and starched.

18:47.166 --> 18:53.094
So, takes me up to Northgate with him, and he says, you can go in here, get your uniforms fixed.

18:53.675 --> 19:07.053
They have a lot of alteration people here, and they had, I mean, they had a, then these ladies were in there, they were just doing all the, all the alterations, and, and then he says, then you go around the block there, you get a haircut.

19:07.073 --> 19:13.542
And so, he says, and I expect that what I've told you to this point, you're gonna remember.

19:14.450 --> 19:18.260
So at that time, yes sir, no sir, yes sir, no sir.

19:19.263 --> 19:27.325
So when I got out of the car, I started to thank him, and then I remembered one of the things that he told me, that you never thank an upperclassman.

19:28.288 --> 19:30.113
If an upperclassman did something for you,

19:30.616 --> 19:35.963
It was because he wanted to do it and never, never thank an upperclassman.

19:36.745 --> 19:42.152
And so I got out of the car and I started to say thank you and then he says, you got everything straight?

19:42.172 --> 19:42.853
And I said, yes, sir.

19:43.274 --> 19:44.115
And I remembered that.

19:44.135 --> 19:47.399
So I never did thank an upperclassman and all that.

19:47.419 --> 19:59.256
During my whole freshman year, I never thanked an upperclassman because that was not, they were doing things for you and you didn't have to thank them for anything if they went out of their way.

19:59.236 --> 20:15.957
Came back to the dorm, my fish old lady was there by the time I arrived and he was going through the same drill that I was going through when I came through the door.

20:16.738 --> 20:27.572
So the first sergeant put me up against the wall again and I went through the drill again.

20:28.227 --> 20:36.538
My first roommate, an official lady, was a young man out of Houston, I still remember his name, Charlie Organ.

20:37.500 --> 20:38.000
What?

20:38.020 --> 20:41.225
Charlie Organ, Charles Organ, or G-A-N.

20:42.567 --> 20:47.113
And so we tried to help each other out, try to make sure everything's right.

20:48.123 --> 20:58.453
He lasted through the fish week and he always kept looking out the window because you could see the Aggie band practicing out.

21:01.960 --> 21:23.395
He was always looking out the window, watching the Aggie band out there practicing, and so he decided that after our first week there, we were in Squadron 6, it was Elno 6, as a pink elephant in a champagne glass, kind of a

21:24.202 --> 21:25.805
Are you saying E-L-M-O?

21:25.905 --> 21:26.927
E-L-N-O.

21:27.227 --> 21:28.689
Hell no, like hell no.

21:29.130 --> 21:33.277
So they call it, instead of using the word hell no, they say L-NO-6.

21:34.259 --> 21:39.107
And it was a pink elephant in a champagne glass, kind of intoxicated.

21:39.127 --> 21:47.020
And so what we did, he decided to go to the Aggie band, so then I was without a roommate for

21:48.755 --> 21:54.834
for about a couple of days and then they decided that they were gonna move another freshman.

21:54.894 --> 21:57.904
His name was Bobby Dotson.

21:57.924 --> 22:00.452
I remember him from Amarillo, Texas.

22:01.411 --> 22:07.202
And he was kind of a shy individual, very religious.

22:08.445 --> 22:11.110
And I said, well, this is not going to work.

22:11.130 --> 22:16.781
But anyway, we worked it out for almost the whole year.

22:17.502 --> 22:20.668
And then after that, he...

22:21.509 --> 22:30.237
My last official lady was a gentleman named William Weisinger from Conroe, Texas.

22:30.978 --> 22:33.320
As a matter of fact, I still stay in touch with him.

22:33.360 --> 22:35.942
He's a retired colonel from the Air Force, lives in California.

22:36.703 --> 22:41.367
So he's made every reunion that we've had, as I have, over the years.

22:42.188 --> 22:51.516
So we stay in touch with each other, either by mail or phone or email or whatever.

22:51.496 --> 22:52.978
We were very close.

22:55.500 --> 22:56.922
Bill Weisinger and I were very close.

22:57.022 --> 23:00.306
I mean, we developed a very strong relationship.

23:01.087 --> 23:09.276
I was kind of like, during the freshman year, we kind of got to know each other pretty well.

23:09.296 --> 23:12.460
When we came in as sophomores, we were already very, very tight, you know.

23:12.480 --> 23:14.702
We were like brothers, really, in reality.

23:15.155 --> 23:21.670
And there wasn't anything that he wouldn't do for me the same way it was for myself, for him.

23:22.050 --> 23:26.601
And so we go in the right direction here.

23:27.162 --> 23:31.692
That first year, describe your room.

23:31.792 --> 23:32.995
What was in your room?

23:32.975 --> 23:37.860
Our room was the barest thing that you've ever seen in your life.

23:37.920 --> 23:54.797
The room was just four walls, concrete floor, which had to be polished, had to be high gloss with the Johnson's floor wax, and that was one of the first things we had to make sure that that room was ready for inspection that Saturday.

23:55.477 --> 23:58.240
They let us out that Saturday at noon, I remember that.

23:58.220 --> 24:07.849
And it was a Friday afternoon, so that Friday morning that room had to be ready for inspection.

24:08.431 --> 24:12.162
The CO, Captain Gatlin,

24:12.682 --> 24:40.579
uh... squadron commander and uh... and the executive officer uh... and the first sergeant the executive officer was bruce hudson he was bruce hudson was from houston and big tall guy and they came in there and inspected us on a friday morning and and of course our floor had to be completely uh... i mean you should be able to see your face in it and everything had to be you just had the

24:40.559 --> 24:48.335
the wash basin and two closets, one on each side, your foot locker, two desks.

24:48.395 --> 24:51.461
You were allowed to have a curtain, so we had a curtain.

24:52.143 --> 24:52.624
That was it.

24:53.004 --> 24:53.606
No radio?

24:53.646 --> 24:54.327
No radio.

24:54.588 --> 25:01.622
Well, yes, they did let us have a radio, but we could not have them on except on

25:02.952 --> 25:04.495
It was certain times of the day.

25:04.555 --> 25:11.670
We couldn't have them in the morning for wake-up call or during call the quarters.

25:12.412 --> 25:13.995
On weekends they would let us have the radios.

25:14.717 --> 25:22.834
Now, if we did things that they did not, if we get in trouble for things that we shouldn't do,

25:22.882 --> 25:26.330
then they would take your radio privileges away.

25:26.791 --> 25:35.289
So we didn't have telephones because they only had one phone which was in the end of the hall and anybody wanted to call, you called by phone.

25:35.991 --> 25:39.338
That's only for emergencies because most communication was by mail.

25:39.689 --> 25:40.370
And that was it.

25:40.991 --> 25:46.782
And so the room in itself was nothing to brag about.

25:46.923 --> 25:55.639
You had to be a senior to have a room that you could put in curtains, carpeting, do the things that you wanted to.

25:55.619 --> 25:59.948
I think when you're a junior, you could also have a throw rug out there, but that was about it.

26:00.709 --> 26:04.717
It was, you know, a class status type thing.

26:04.758 --> 26:08.205
So the idea was that your class stuck together, as it always has been.

26:09.167 --> 26:14.337
And so there was about 35 of us, 35 freshmen, I'd say.

26:14.536 --> 26:17.959
How did you register for classes that first?

26:17.979 --> 26:18.480
Do you remember?

26:19.261 --> 26:25.467
Yeah, we registered for class during the week, and I can't remember what day it was, but they had everything ready for us.

26:25.567 --> 26:33.995
What they gave us is these IBM cards, and you would go to the course, the particular course.

26:34.015 --> 26:34.856
Sebesa or?

26:34.996 --> 26:35.396
Sebesa.

26:35.697 --> 26:37.719
Sebesa, right, at Sebesa.

26:38.419 --> 26:42.163
And you had a certain time that you would go in,

26:42.143 --> 26:48.649
And when you went in there, then you started looking for the particular whatever courses you could take, go there.

26:49.270 --> 26:53.354
They assigned you a time and you had to take whatever they gave you.

26:53.374 --> 27:00.621
You know, it wasn't a situation, there was no situation where you would go in there and say, well, I want this prof or that prof or that.

27:01.341 --> 27:04.464
They didn't even tell you who the profs were going to be because that's the way it was.

27:05.145 --> 27:10.210
So I guess I learned during the process of

27:11.000 --> 27:17.972
of registering that you would try to work your classes according to what fits your needs.

27:18.070 --> 27:26.579
And at first it was, you know, like classes, because we used to have drill on Saturday, so Monday through Friday, my classes were all over the place.

27:26.639 --> 27:28.261
And I said, no, this isn't going to work.

27:28.301 --> 27:34.747
So, I mean, I learned something from that the next time around, try to put them all in line where I wouldn't have to be walking all over the campus.

27:35.528 --> 27:37.450
And so that worked out.

27:37.790 --> 27:43.476
Did you have some, as you look back, were some of those courses you had that first year important to you?

27:43.977 --> 27:46.980
Do you have some key courses and or teachers?

27:47.973 --> 27:48.699
Your freshman year?

27:50.514 --> 27:51.925
Well, I started out in pre-law.

27:53.187 --> 27:57.393
And I guess the history courses were very important to me.

27:57.413 --> 27:58.755
But I love history.

27:59.055 --> 27:59.696
Who taught them?

27:59.716 --> 28:00.096
Do you remember?

28:00.116 --> 28:02.179
God, I can't remember the name of the professors.

28:03.902 --> 28:07.066
But they were important to me.

28:07.587 --> 28:10.070
And of course English, which I was very weak in.

28:10.110 --> 28:11.993
I had to take a remediation course in English.

28:13.174 --> 28:19.163
And I had probably the only female teacher professor on the campus.

28:19.263 --> 28:20.224
Who?

28:22.027 --> 28:23.270
I'll try to go back.

28:23.391 --> 28:24.233
We'll get that later.

28:24.694 --> 28:26.198
She was in the 58.

28:26.980 --> 28:33.097
Describe her in her abilities and her methods of teaching and so forth.

28:33.177 --> 28:38.010
She was young.

28:38.378 --> 28:44.927
I'd say around her mid-twenties probably, blonde.

28:45.187 --> 28:45.708
Good teacher?

28:46.349 --> 28:47.350
Yeah she was a good teacher.

28:48.112 --> 28:49.013
She was a good teacher.

28:49.073 --> 28:50.755
She did a great job.

28:52.357 --> 28:57.004
I don't think she stayed here very long probably because it was mostly all male.

28:57.985 --> 29:05.736
But she was the only, I remember, probably one of the few female teachers.

29:07.218 --> 29:08.920
We had a pretty good-sized class.

29:09.000 --> 29:12.103
I'd say about 25 or 30 students in there.

29:13.004 --> 29:17.929
And so she was very disciplined.

29:18.710 --> 29:24.055
We did a lot of writing and term paper, very difficult.

29:24.335 --> 29:25.377
She made it very difficult.

29:25.417 --> 29:30.982
We had to go one of the term papers that we had, which was a short paper, and then we had a longer one.

29:31.022 --> 29:36.668
I can't remember which one that was, but it was artwork that was in the student center.

29:37.053 --> 29:47.307
and we had to write an essay on the artwork, as we saw the picture, or the art.

29:48.188 --> 29:53.074
And so we, I put a lot of time into that.

29:53.094 --> 29:56.479
I remember sitting in the student center and looking and looking and looking at it.

29:56.459 --> 30:04.334
And then I was very disappointed in the grades she gave me because I thought that I should have, I had done better than what the grades she gave me.

30:05.376 --> 30:08.142
And my official lady at that time was an English major.

30:08.903 --> 30:12.550
So when I wrote the paper, he checked it.

30:13.452 --> 30:15.516
And if there was any corrections to me, he made the corrections.

30:15.536 --> 30:17.961
So when I turned in, I said, well, I've got a great paper here.

30:17.941 --> 30:20.043
And so she gave me a C on that paper.

30:21.144 --> 30:22.606
And I'm pretty sure that's what it was.

30:22.626 --> 30:24.528
And I thought I had a B or better, you know.

30:24.608 --> 30:26.249
But anyway, it didn't happen.

30:26.289 --> 30:44.708
And I guess back then I was a freshman not into the going and speaking to the professors and talking to them and telling them that, you know, I, you know, in other words, you go over there and sell yourself to the professor.

30:44.688 --> 30:48.612
So I wasn't in that mode at that time, but I learned as you go.

30:49.073 --> 30:52.456
And the more time you can go in there, the better off you are.

30:52.536 --> 30:57.262
And mainly if you show that you have interest in the course and you're trying to do the right thing.

30:57.322 --> 31:06.692
But that course in particular was important because I think that kind of set the tone for me.

31:07.473 --> 31:10.095
I never had to repeat an English course.

31:10.115 --> 31:11.657
And so when I went into freshman year,
