WEBVTT

00:01.837 --> 00:05.643
to Hispanic employees, and did this treatment 
change over time? Well, actually,

00:07.346 --> 00:20.746
at the onset, let's talk about the dining hall, for 
instance. Way back there, the only thing they

00:22.990 --> 00:29.700
hired were people from Mexico, for some reason or 
another, because they were considered good

00:30.119 --> 00:37.088
cooks, I guess, and

00:30.119 --> 00:37.088
good workers. So you're saying the dining hall was 
mostly spent? Yeah, I would say that 100% were

00:42.575 --> 00:47.521
people from Mexico. And they did a heck of a good 
job, and they took good care of the students. They

00:53.609 --> 00:55.131
were also cooks. you know, salad people, which I 
don't know what you call that, but they made salads

00:55.718 --> 01:02.826
for people. And they were also people who

01:02.906 --> 01:17.062
took up, well, cleaned the mess afterwards, you 
know, they were KP people, bus boys and what have

01:02.906 --> 01:17.062
you. And... What about managing the place? The 
manager also was from Mexico, by the name of Juan

01:26.043 --> 01:28.086
Peña, I think his name was. Peña, Juan Peña. He was 
also. But then something happened. The state

01:33.352 --> 01:44.766
legislature passed a law that non-citizens could 
not work in a state-owned institution or

01:33.352 --> 01:44.766
state-operated institution. So abruptly, they 
were all let out. And so then they hired an American

01:55.017 --> 02:04.088
American citizens, and they hired Hispanics and 
blacks and Anglos and everything else. But I mean,

02:05.310 --> 02:11.037
everybody was treated well there. As far as the 
overall campus is concerned, there weren't too

02:11.057 --> 02:18.006
many opportunities for Hispanics to work on the 
campus. I don't know why.

02:23.384 --> 02:30.275
Even right now, the percentage of Hispanic 
workers is very, very low. I mean, you've hardly

02:30.555 --> 02:33.379
seen them. And I know that a lot of them are 
qualified. And even when I was there, when I was

02:38.547 --> 02:52.108
there at operation manager, I hired Hispanics to 
work as students mostly.

02:52.544 --> 02:53.465
office workers. I had several Hispanic office 
workers. And you could see quite a few office

02:57.590 --> 03:02.216
workers of Hispanic origin also on the campus. But 
as far as a male

03:02.957 --> 03:11.868
worker is concerned, Hispanic worker, you hardly 
see them on the campus. This is one thing I don't

03:11.888 --> 03:13.530
understand. And I think that exists now. Other 
than student Hispanics, Hispanic Male workers

03:21.603 --> 03:25.488
are very scarce on the campus. I noticed that. I was 
there 52 years. And during all those years, it

03:29.314 --> 03:32.679
never did improve, as far as I'm concerned. 
Really? Never did. I don't know why. I don't

03:36.904 --> 03:40.049
understand it, because they are good workers. Did 
you ever work with any other Spanx? Hardly ever, I

03:42.212 --> 03:44.455
assume? What do you mean, did I work with them? In 
your job. Did I work some of them? Work with them.

03:49.775 --> 03:52.999
Yeah, I had real good workers. Yeah, I had Isidro 
Lopez, who worked with me for years. Actually, he

04:00.469 --> 04:07.177
was a foreman under me, and he did a good job. Very 
dedicated. I mean, he'd be the first set and the

04:08.299 --> 04:10.982
last leave. If you needed him on a Saturday or 
Sunday, he was there, no question. And I'm sure

04:16.474 --> 04:24.204
that your Uncle Paul, who also was foreman at the 
dining hall, he can tell you about the Hispanic

04:16.474 --> 04:24.204
workers. But he would have trouble with these, you 
know, with some of these other workers of other

04:24.945 --> 04:31.414
nationalities who just didn't. And you can see it 
now. You take, right now, your hardworking people

04:33.337 --> 04:41.307
or your people from Mexico and your Hispanic 
people, they're working. But I have people here

04:42.113 --> 04:48.981
somehow, I don't know what it is, we just don't want 
to work anymore. First thing they want to know is

04:50.964 --> 05:05.301
how much you're going to pay them, and of course 
that's a good thing, but how many breaks you get

04:50.964 --> 05:05.301
during the day and how long you break, stuff like 
that. Whereas you, one of these Mexican workers,

05:09.535 --> 05:10.456
They'll work right now. They don't ask those kind 
of questions. But getting back to your original

05:12.679 --> 05:25.757
question about how to, I think your question was, 
how did A&M react to the Hispanic workers or

05:12.679 --> 05:25.757
something like that? How did they treat them? Was 
it equal treatment for them? Well, there were

05:28.200 --> 05:33.687
some, of course, there's pros and cons here. Where 
I stood, I thought some were treated unjustly. But

05:38.948 --> 05:44.093
the overall administrator did not think so. They 
had some other overrulia, and that was it. But you

05:51.160 --> 05:58.807
hardly see any Hispanic foreman anywhere in 
charge of anything.

06:01.450 --> 06:06.795
And there's never been a large influx of expanding 
workers that ain't them, male that is. And I doubt

06:11.479 --> 06:14.862
if there are too many female. Whether that's 
because there's not enough skill amongst them,

06:14.882 --> 06:31.059
because some of these jobs do require skill, like 
they need carpenters, painters, electricians,

06:14.882 --> 06:31.059
and air conditioned people, and they're all 
Anglos. But even today, would you say that at

06:32.060 --> 06:35.483
managerial levels, It hasn't really changed 
much. There really aren't many Hispanics at all.

06:39.555 --> 06:41.297
No, it has not changed much at all. I can tell you 
that right now. It has not changed. Well, how did

06:44.962 --> 06:52.492
your coworkers, non-Hispanic coworkers, 
respond to you or to other Hispanics working with

06:44.962 --> 06:52.492
them? Was there a problem there? Was that an equal 
footing, I would say? You're asking how did I get

06:58.461 --> 07:00.964
along with my... Anglo co-workers? Yes. Well, I 
got along fine with them. Actually, when you come

07:07.886 --> 07:24.271
right down to it, you could call the whole system 
co-workers, that is the wage people, that is the

07:07.886 --> 07:24.271
so-called non-faculty people, because y'all 
work together for the university. And in my

07:25.312 --> 07:29.398
capacity, since chemistry was the largest 
department, largest department on campus, we

07:30.593 --> 07:41.126
required more of the physical plant services than 
any other department. And as a result, I got to see

07:42.628 --> 07:54.162
those people more and I had a chance to work with 
them and I found that they were very good to me. And I

07:54.282 --> 07:57.646
tried to be as equal as them, be the same as them. We 
worked together. And even now, when I'm retired,

07:59.973 --> 08:04.057
and I'm retired, I meet them on the street. Boy, 
they don't hesitate to go and shake my hand. We talk

08:07.421 --> 08:08.642
about it all the time. So they actually got along 
fine. So I got along with them all right. Being

08:16.410 --> 08:20.694
Hispanic, it seemed to me that they have that same 
attitude toward other Hispanics. So it might be

08:20.714 --> 08:24.698
that maybe, I don't know what it is. I just can't put 
my finger on it, why the Hispanics are not being

08:24.718 --> 08:29.203
hired more over there. Let me ask you about, I know 
you were involved on the grievances committee.

08:34.429 --> 08:38.392
Can you tell me in what capacity you served the 
grievances committee? And if there were any

08:38.432 --> 08:48.561
special incidences that have an impact on 
employees at Texas A&M that you feel you can

08:38.432 --> 08:48.561
comment on because of that experience? Well, the 
problem here is that I did not deal with Hispanics

08:48.701 --> 08:57.589
on this. But I was the only Hispanic. on this 
so-called panel. And instead of taking the

09:04.135 --> 09:12.522
grievance, a person taking his grievances to 
court, he would take it to this panel. And this

09:12.683 --> 09:17.327
panel, from this panel, he could pick out someone 
to defend him. And then the other people that were

09:18.848 --> 09:24.213
against him could pick out someone to defend them. 
And then from the panel, they had a group that would

09:25.054 --> 09:30.139
act as judge and jury. And so they'd hear us. And the 
university would accept that recommendation.

09:35.638 --> 09:37.080
And to me, it was fair. It was fair. I think it was 
real fair. Not all that. The guy who

09:41.025 --> 09:51.298
felt that he was done an injustice could go out and 
get a lawyer instead of getting one of us. And I saw

09:51.979 --> 09:55.643
that only at one time, that's all. And to me, it was 
effective in that actually there was one incident

09:59.988 --> 10:28.257
where one fellow was more or less fired and he felt 
that they did it just when he got hurt on the job and

09:59.988 --> 10:28.257
the hospital was pretty expensive so I 
represented him and as a result of

09:59.988 --> 10:28.257
the hearing and And the discussion that went on, 
actually

10:29.114 --> 10:37.868
he was reinstated and they paid for the 
hospitalization. And if I'm thinking right, I

10:38.949 --> 10:42.034
think he's still there. But they had let him go. 
They had let him go. He was fired, period. And this

10:47.142 --> 10:49.206
is what this grievance was all about. But I never 
did. Since there's not too many Hispanics, well,

10:51.490 --> 10:55.856
no problem with none there, hardly. Very few at 
that time. Now, I've been gone four years. Now,

10:59.741 --> 11:01.904
they might have had a large group there, but I doubt 
it. I don't think so. Because I don't see them, and I

11:03.005 --> 11:09.313
don't hear anybody that I know tell me they work at 
A&M except one or two, and that's it. The same one or

11:09.553 --> 11:12.317
two that have been there 20 years, they're the same 
ones there now. Something else I'd like you to

11:12.955 --> 11:15.438
comment on along those lines. You were 
instrumental in the first affirmative action

11:15.518 --> 11:19.463
program at Texas A&M. Can you tell me how you got 
that going and what exactly was entailed, what it

11:20.144 --> 11:24.910
produced? Well, actually, I got this letter from 
President Runner

11:24.950 --> 11:42.152
asking me if I would serve with this committee of 
four to come up with an affirmative action program

11:24.950 --> 11:42.152
for the university since just about every other 
university on the campus, I mean the state of Texas

11:42.385 --> 11:48.111
had one except us. When was this? Peter had been, oh 
God, maybe ten years ago, I guess, that's a good

11:50.033 --> 11:56.119
rough guess. That's when it was, Pratt & Rudder was 
still, no, no, it wasn't Pratt & Rudder.

12:01.225 --> 12:02.106
Vanderbilt? No, no, Williamson. Okay. Chained 
after it was Pratt & Williamson, that's right,

12:05.269 --> 12:09.253
right after, yeah. So that had been about 10 years 
ago. And so I thought I'd be honored to serve on it.

12:17.353 --> 12:32.594
And so the purpose of that was to make sure that the

12:17.353 --> 12:32.594
university would hire a fair percentage of Anglos 
and Blacks. And that the university would make a

12:33.716 --> 12:39.223
strong effort to hire Spanish and Blacks. And it 
was an intricate thing to deal with. And I don't

12:48.092 --> 12:57.743
know whether it's had any impact on hiring 
Hispanics, because I thought for sure that it

12:48.092 --> 12:57.743
would. But as far as I know, I don't think so. But the 
thing is that this thing also applied for the

13:02.629 --> 13:05.873
faculty. And of course, they hired quite a few 
Hispanic faculty. And that's what I'm saying. If

13:11.466 --> 13:22.580
the Hispanic has some sort of preparation or some 
sort of an academic background, I think he can be

13:11.466 --> 13:22.580
hired. But sometimes I wonder whether the 
applicants that are turned down, whether they're

13:22.600 --> 13:31.111
qualified or not to accept this particular job 
they want. And I think the affirmative action is a

13:32.313 --> 13:37.780
good thing to have. if they go ahead and carry it out 
like it's supposed to, or if they were to implement

13:38.418 --> 13:48.587
it like it should be, but I don't think they are. 
Actually, one of the affirmative action officers

13:48.787 --> 14:06.163
that left about four or five years ago told me that 
she left because the university was not strong on

13:48.787 --> 14:06.163
implementing the affirmative action. you know uh 
whatever affirmative action uh program and uh so i

14:06.515 --> 14:31.729
really can't tell you whether it's done any good or 
not peter uh i doubt if it has of course uh president

14:06.515 --> 14:31.729
reagan didn't want that in the country i don't 
think i think he wanted to get rid of it but they

14:06.515 --> 14:31.729
still have it at nm And according to newspapers, 
A&M is doing all they can to recruit minorities,

14:32.823 --> 14:42.492
not only in school, but also in jobs. And I don't 
know just how well they've done. I don't know. Let

14:50.380 --> 14:54.844
me change gears once again and ask you about 
something that's a little more recent. The last 10

14:56.806 --> 15:01.210
or 15 years has seen sort of a new wave of 
immigration from Mexico. How do you think this has

15:01.527 --> 15:04.110
affected the Hispanic community in Bryan? Have 
these people generally been accepted? Is there a

15:07.855 --> 15:10.277
pro and con to this issue? What's your response? 
Explain that again, Peter. I kind of see what it is.

15:15.023 --> 15:16.885
You're talking about people from Mexico now, 
right? Right. The immigrants, the aliens coming

15:17.426 --> 15:18.928
over. How has that affected this community? Okay, 
you're talking about the working people. You're

15:23.213 --> 15:26.276
not talking about... Well, I don't think there's 
too many of the other. Okay, all right. Actually,

15:28.159 --> 15:29.340
Pete... Peter, I think it's helped the community. 
And I think that

15:32.430 --> 15:50.583
people, leading citizens of the community think 
that without these people, they couldn't have

15:32.430 --> 15:50.583
accomplished what they have thus far, like for 
instance, roadworks. Because of the labor force.

15:51.584 --> 15:53.067
The labor force. At A&M, you take at A&M, all this 
big building program they've got going there. If

15:58.553 --> 16:07.443
you go there, you'll notice that so many of them, 
the big majority of them, that are doing the hard

15:58.553 --> 16:07.443
work and are doing the heavy semen work are 
Hispanics. And they're the ones that are doing a

16:08.124 --> 16:16.412
lot of the so-called bricklaying, doing a lot of 
semen work, this fine semen work. A lot of them are

16:16.432 --> 16:18.715
doing this fine hard work. And you can see that in 
Brian, too. In Brian, you take younger brothers

16:20.357 --> 16:22.699
who who is one of the largest road contractors 
around here,

16:23.573 --> 16:38.241
he'll tell you right now that without those 
people, he couldn't keep up with his deadline. He

16:38.262 --> 16:40.466
couldn't meet his deadline. And if you drive any 
place while they're doing this, you'll find that

16:40.486 --> 16:46.257
they are that there's a lot of these people from 
Mexico that are there doing this hard work. A lot of

16:52.168 --> 16:55.532
these people do a lot of work for the city of Bryan. 
The city of Bryan can't find American citizens to

16:56.353 --> 17:06.386
do this work, so they have to rely on these amnesty 
people to do that. And they're the one that do your

17:07.187 --> 17:11.032
farm work for you. They're the one that clean your 
cow sheds and your horse sheds. They do a lot of

17:17.236 --> 17:18.217
work. And now, as you know, a lot of our own here, I 
don't think the black community want to do that

17:18.638 --> 17:26.688
work anymore. They figure that you don't see black 
people doing that kind of work no more. They used

17:31.794 --> 17:33.416
to, but not anymore. They don't feel that they 
should. And so if they're going to do it, then your

17:36.660 --> 17:43.328
wage is going to go way up. And these people that are 
working hard, they're working for the way you said

17:43.898 --> 17:51.408
they are now, whatever it is. I get a lot of minimum 
wage at the beginning. Do you think that there's

17:56.355 --> 18:11.215
been any negative response, perhaps in light of 
the fact that some would say this is sort of

17:56.355 --> 18:11.215
bringing a rising Hispanic community a step back? 
It's an added weight. Do you see it in that light?

18:14.088 --> 18:15.830
And that in way to the Hispanic community? Yes. 
Well, I think that

18:17.691 --> 18:31.824
I don't think that the Hispanic community feel 
that these Amnesty workers are taking their jobs

18:17.691 --> 18:31.824
away from them. Because they probably won't do 
that job either because they speak well English,

18:31.844 --> 18:43.234
they speak good English, and they can get better 
jobs working in stores and places like that. To me,

18:43.703 --> 18:57.382
I think it helps because, especially the Hispanic 
business people, because a lot of these people go

18:43.703 --> 18:57.382
to the Hispanic business people because they can 
communicate with them. And the people who are in

18:57.402 --> 19:07.275
some sort of recreation, the Hispanic people, 
these people patronize them because they

18:57.402 --> 19:07.275
commute. No, I don't think so. I think that the 
Hispanic community considers them an advantage.

19:12.931 --> 19:13.532
being here. I know that in the past you've worked 
with naturalization of aliens. Can you tell me

19:20.259 --> 19:21.560
something about that? What exactly was involved? 
Well, actually,

19:22.921 --> 19:39.799
many, when we came back from the war, from 
overseas,

19:22.921 --> 19:39.799
at that time it finally hit me that it was not fair 
that the parents of these boys that went overseas

19:40.960 --> 19:51.955
and fought for this country, and many of them 
didn't even come back, that their parents had no

19:40.960 --> 19:51.955
rights, couldn't even vote. And they've been here 
for 50 years, 20, 40 years, and still didn't have a

19:51.975 --> 19:57.422
right to vote. And actually, those that were real 
poor had not even right for welfare, not even right

19:58.604 --> 20:05.192
for anything. And the only way that they could have 
this right by becoming a citizen. And so we decided

20:14.885 --> 20:19.831
to go ahead and set up schools. We went to the they 
had a lawyer organization here. I forget the name

20:25.699 --> 20:26.881
of it. And we went to them and they got together with 
the American Legion and said they would help us as

20:27.882 --> 20:38.777
far as the lawyers were concerned to write up some 
of the things that they need to know, and the

20:39.280 --> 20:42.906
questions and answers and so forth. Kind of a 
textbook in tablet form. And they wrote this

20:45.912 --> 20:47.555
textbook for us. Because the one from, I got a 
textbook from San Antonio Immigration Service,

20:48.496 --> 20:56.230
from Immigration Services in San Antonio. 
They're very complicated, it's only English. But

20:59.155 --> 21:01.980
they did it in English. But we found a group here 
that would be able to transfer. They translated in

21:05.426 --> 21:07.928
Spanish. So we had both of them. So they had both of 
them. So then we got together. Your uncle Paul and I

21:12.733 --> 21:22.984
got together and studied this thing, I mean, 
extensively until we learned about it ourselves.

21:23.704 --> 21:29.470
And then this information, we started having 
classes and passed it on to them. And they were very

21:30.243 --> 21:31.965
eager to learn. They learned. And not only that, we 
had to go to a lot of trouble to establish a

21:34.228 --> 21:39.735
residence for them. A lot of them came here in 1902 
and couldn't prove it. So we had the right to places

21:45.001 --> 21:49.326
where they worked or take them over there. I mean, 
we made many trips out to Braggers Bottom, Waco, to

21:49.346 --> 21:59.018
San Antonio, to places like that, the way they They 
entered, and people that knew them, and we got

21:59.521 --> 22:04.188
affidavits from these people that they worked 
for. And that's how we did it. And it was a hassle.

22:09.255 --> 22:11.297
But we made them into citizens that way. And we'd 
take them to San Antonio, and they'd pass a test.

22:17.106 --> 22:20.891
And then when they'd, right here in Braddus 
County, they'd be sworn in. One time we swore in

22:20.971 --> 22:23.274
about 30 at one time. Wow. Old people, and they 
answered the question, and... They became

22:28.023 --> 22:32.408
citizens, and they were just thrilled to be able to 
vote, to have a voice in the government. And of

22:33.929 --> 22:39.976
course, the sons and daughters that were very 
proud of their parents because they were

22:33.929 --> 22:39.976
citizens. And so we did this. And that, I think, 
helped the community. And I was always very

22:48.845 --> 22:56.393
grateful to these lawyers that started this, that 
helped us. did not turn us down when we went to ask

22:56.558 --> 22:59.823
for their help. They did it pre-charge. They 
didn't charge anything. And they'd make several

23:02.827 --> 23:08.115
trips to see how we were doing to make sure that we 
were doing it right. And they liked what they saw.

23:10.739 --> 23:11.440
What about today? I think you've also been 
involved in some of this today. There's a lot of

23:14.004 --> 23:21.055
aliens that, with the recent amnesty program, 
also needed to verify it. Well, the only way I'm

23:21.095 --> 23:24.760
involved there, Peter, is that I'm able to write 
letters for them. You know, I write letters for

23:28.829 --> 23:44.109
them and also helpful fill out because when they go 
to this place where they're supposed to be

23:28.829 --> 23:44.109
processed, they'll give them a blank and say, you 
fill it or find somebody to fill it for you. Well,

23:44.550 --> 23:50.558
it's me they find or somebody like me and we fill 
these blanks based on what they tell us. And then we

23:51.559 --> 23:55.084
have a lot of this required notarization and some 
required letter attachment of some sort, and we do

23:55.587 --> 23:59.151
that. That's the only, that's the extent I'm 
involved in, but we do it, we don't charge anybody,

23:59.251 --> 24:05.699
we never charge anybody. We never have, you know. 
And so, and then anyway we can help them. Sometimes

24:12.747 --> 24:23.620
they have problems in Mexico, and, or somebody 
wants to go to Mexico, we write a letter on their

24:12.747 --> 24:23.620
behalf to the Immigration and Activation 
Service, and they'll give us what you call an

24:24.258 --> 24:28.603
emergency permit for them to go and come back. And 
that's the kind of thing we're involved in right

24:29.204 --> 24:31.147
now. Other than that, that's it. What about

24:33.870 --> 24:52.493
political action within the Hispanic community, 
specifically politicians that come from it, the

24:33.870 --> 24:52.493
way that local politicians have addressed the 
Hispanic community or tried to gain support from

24:33.870 --> 24:52.493
it? Can you comment on this, what it's been like? 
Well, unlike many years ago, the politicians

24:55.197 --> 25:08.378
today are really going after the Hispanic vote 
because there's so many of them here now. And

25:09.720 --> 25:19.476
because of that, the Hispanics are better off 
because

25:09.720 --> 25:19.476
they somehow or other, in certain areas, 
outnumber the Anglos and the blacks in some of

25:20.013 --> 25:26.560
these voting precincts.

25:29.303 --> 25:42.437
And when these officials get elected, they tend to 
remember that the Hispanic voted for them and they

25:29.303 --> 25:42.437
pass legislature that benefits Hispanic. But the 
Hispanic's been very active, too. If they see a

25:44.899 --> 25:49.564
candidate that that will serve the community well 
and will not forget them while they'll go out and

25:49.932 --> 26:02.272
stump for him and do what they can to help get him 
elected. But you don't see any of this, they're not

26:02.292 --> 26:09.203
after, they're not in for selfish purposes. They 
just want a good guy that is reasonable, that will

26:12.140 --> 26:16.565
understand, that will be somewhat sympathetic 
towards them. And that plot, that's it. That's all

26:18.247 --> 26:19.649
they want. And to me, I've been with these Aspani 
for so long. To me, the attitude is that if this guy

26:25.316 --> 26:31.803
does a good job this year, then I'll vote for him 
next time around. That's the extent of the

26:31.824 --> 26:34.226
interest in politics. That's it. Has this always 
been the case? To me, it's always been that way

26:36.970 --> 26:39.172
here. Now you've got a few guys that, you know, I 
think they want something out of it, but not too

26:42.464 --> 26:46.750
many of them. They're obscured.

26:51.056 --> 26:53.880
What about Hispanic candidates themselves? 
Hispanic candidates themselves, how are they

26:53.900 --> 26:57.405
fair to Brian? Well, we just somehow have never 
gotten the right people to run for office, Peter.

27:09.482 --> 27:11.425
The people that normally run... somehow, or not,

27:12.164 --> 27:19.352
let me change that a little bit. I just don't think 
that, they think they're qualified, but they're

27:21.074 --> 27:24.919
not. And so they run and they keep running and they 
don't get elected, then they wonder why they don't

27:27.121 --> 27:33.969
get elected. What's happening to us is that The 
Hispanic that is qualified and that could make a

27:39.637 --> 27:51.230
good candidate or could be an asset to his 
community, to Hispanic, he's not here. He gets his

27:51.250 --> 28:00.921
education and he leaves town because this town 
doesn't have anything to offer him or doesn't hire

27:51.250 --> 28:00.921
him. This is why I know one of the members of the 
Brian B., Roy Marine to be specific, they had a...

28:09.168 --> 28:12.312
an opening here for a school teacher. And he wanted 
to come back to Bryan. He's an Odessa teacher's

28:13.914 --> 28:15.275
school. And he wrote a letter, a real nice letter, 
and he made a personal visit down here. And they

28:23.305 --> 28:25.688
gave him hope, but he never heard from them 
anymore. And yet, they didn't have any Hispanic

28:26.349 --> 28:30.073
teachers. I think only one at that time, or maybe 
two. Two Herrera sisters, I think. And so Roy never

28:36.843 --> 28:40.366
came back to Bryan. And I know that Fred wanted to 
teach here in Bryan, and he never could get on. I

28:50.376 --> 29:02.968
don't know whether he made a real effort, but he 
said that when he talked to some of the people, they

28:50.376 --> 29:02.968
kind of indicated that he didn't have much of a 
chance.

29:03.927 --> 29:04.988
This is our problem. The people that are qualified 
to run for office are not around. Just close your

29:10.315 --> 29:24.552
eyes and think how many Hispanics have graduated 
from high school here in Bryan, raised here in

29:10.315 --> 29:24.552
Bryan, that graduated from A&M or University of 
Houston or Sam Houston. They're not here in Bryan.

29:26.793 --> 29:35.484
There's only one that finally came back to Bryan, 
and that's Daniel Hernandez, who got his law

29:26.793 --> 29:35.484
degree from Georgetown. He's back. But other than 
that, the rest of them are not here. They're not

29:40.210 --> 29:40.751
here. But until these people that are finishing, 
until these Hispanics that are from here, that

29:41.752 --> 29:56.631
were born and raised here, and after they graduate 
from the college can find something here, then

29:41.752 --> 29:56.631
we're going to have this problem. We're only going 
to have a blue collar running for position, and

29:57.083 --> 30:02.611
he's not qualified for it. And the people know it. 
He doesn't get elected. He doesn't have it. Well,

30:06.977 --> 30:09.181
that's a good time for me to ask you this question, 
then. What do you think are the relevant issues in

30:09.742 --> 30:13.647
Brian's Hispanic community today? What are the 
things that, if you look forward, that you think

30:15.430 --> 30:20.357
need to be addressed or that Is this mainly it right 
here, the fact that it's hard to retain a lot of

30:20.759 --> 30:30.089
inner support in the Hispanic community because 
there's just not that much to offer? Well,

30:31.631 --> 30:45.205
actually, also another thing, too, Peter,

30:31.631 --> 30:45.205
we're not prepared, really, some of us, to run for 
office. We don't seem to want to prepare

30:45.225 --> 30:47.728
ourselves. We don't have a, we've never had, 
within our community, road models. The kind that

30:57.325 --> 31:01.311
would set a good example for you. And we have road 
models, but they're not here. You never see them,

31:06.517 --> 31:10.903
you never hear from them, and they never address 
our children. People don't know. When they come to

31:12.385 --> 31:14.868
town, they're strangers, you know? And I think 
that The Hispanic family cites that the parents do

31:19.771 --> 31:33.724
not encourage a complete education. You know what 
I mean? They say, look, go to school. Soon you can

31:39.430 --> 31:40.471
read and write. That's enough. Get your job. Learn 
to be a mechanic or a plumber or go out and work on

31:42.713 --> 31:48.158
construction. And that's what's happening. And 
the first thing you know, the boy's 20 years old, he

31:49.523 --> 31:52.847
gets married, that's it. That's the end of it. And 
then later on, he wants to run for something. He's

31:56.070 --> 31:57.651
not going to get elected, Peter. I mean, it's our 
fault too, you know. We

32:00.454 --> 32:13.808
need people that

32:00.454 --> 32:13.808
will stay here and succeed so that these kids can 
see what success is like, can see what a successful

32:15.492 --> 32:22.760
young man looks like. And of course, we've got a 
few, but not hardly. And those somehow or other

32:26.844 --> 32:35.133
seem to obscure themselves from the majority of 
Hispanics. They seem to want to assimilate into

32:35.353 --> 32:45.043
the American culture, more or less, because they 
figure, well, that's where the money's at. I mean,

32:45.412 --> 32:50.516
who owns a corporation here in Hispanic, you know, 
families? Nobody. In other words, they're going

32:51.837 --> 33:01.045
to be seen with those people because those are the 
people that are going to make them a living. And

33:01.886 --> 33:05.069
they don't worry too much about us, you know. 
That's the problem. Well, I think that about wraps

33:09.933 --> 33:12.575
it up. Do you have anything further to add? Well, 
no, Peter, I just wasn't too prepared for this, but

33:15.331 --> 33:23.783
I just gave it to you from the heart. I know it may not 
be exactly what you wanted. You know, I've been

33:29.711 --> 33:43.009
around here in this town for 74 years, and there's a 
lot in my mind that I could say, but it'll take a long

33:29.711 --> 33:43.009
time, and I know y'all don't have that kind of time. 
But I've seen so much, and one of these days I'll sit

33:44.018 --> 34:02.321
down and write the story of my life, and then you'll 
see more of what you wanted to see. You'll see

34:02.842 --> 34:09.250
probably not more of what you wanted to see, but 
you'll see what you wanted to see tonight or hear

34:02.842 --> 34:09.250
from me tonight. But I hope this will be of some 
help. I'm sure it will, and I look forward to that.

34:14.476 --> 34:20.869
If nothing else, this concludes the interview, 
December 5th, 1989. I'm

34:20.910 --> 34:27.183
sorry to interrupt you, but if there's anything 
else I can do for you, let me know. Okay, thank you.
