WEBVTT

00:04.216 --> 00:05.880
Let's see, had you finished that sentence?

00:05.900 --> 00:20.250
There wasn't anything about DNA and messenger DNA and mitochondria and all of those molecular, cellular activities.

00:20.230 --> 00:49.545
All of that immunology and immunosuppressants and all types of pharmaceutical agents either enhance or those things that had to do with membrane transformations and blockers and

00:49.525 --> 00:55.272
stimulators and all of that really has happened in the last 20 years.

01:01.500 --> 01:02.261
Who was it?

01:02.361 --> 01:08.629
You said that that first week you went home and said, I'm thinking about dropping out.

01:09.550 --> 01:17.740
But then you obviously fell in love with, you got wrapped up in it.

01:18.200 --> 01:19.482
What caused you to

01:21.217 --> 01:24.487
to change your mind that first year?

01:24.507 --> 01:29.202
Well, I guess the fact that I

01:29.485 --> 01:48.184
was able to do well in the curriculum, and the alternative to that was going to teaching in the public school system, vocational agriculture, I guess, and it wasn't too lucrative.

01:49.145 --> 01:56.573
Were there any meaningful conversations or advisory sessions you had that first year?

01:57.143 --> 01:59.348
with some faculty members or someone else?

02:00.791 --> 02:01.452
Not really.

02:02.635 --> 02:06.063
During those four years who did you turn to for any council?

02:10.412 --> 02:11.414
No one.

02:13.419 --> 02:14.882
Who were your closest buddies?

02:15.622 --> 02:21.911
Oh, just as I say, my anatomy group, I guess.

02:25.216 --> 02:35.672
But we never talked about personal things or family situations.

02:35.652 --> 02:39.359
Most of the students were married.

02:40.462 --> 02:43.307
Was there much social life between the students?

02:43.568 --> 02:46.474
Well, there weren't that many married.

02:46.995 --> 02:50.742
Most of them, there weren't very many married students in my class.

02:52.645 --> 02:53.587
Really, so.

02:55.431 --> 03:00.901
Did y'all make some close friendships with other couples?

03:01.963 --> 03:08.637
Oh, no, with maybe one other couple, the Huffs, I guess.

03:08.817 --> 03:12.865
We didn't have time to frighten out much.

03:12.845 --> 03:23.577
Alright, by the end of your first semester you began to feel comparatively comfortable in terms of your ability to survive academically.

03:24.218 --> 03:24.878
I think so.

03:26.721 --> 03:37.873
Were there, during those four years, were there any other memorable events, concerns, problems that you

03:38.782 --> 03:44.811
came upon like that day when you said you thought about going home and telling your wife you weren't going to do it?

03:45.313 --> 03:47.644
No, not really.

03:48.653 --> 03:54.080
It was all mundane, I guess.

03:54.141 --> 04:07.238
You knew you had a job to do, and you had a family to provide for, and that was where you spent your time.

04:07.379 --> 04:13.127
Now, over on the main campus in those days, grades were posted publicly.

04:13.407 --> 04:14.188
Were they here?

04:14.168 --> 04:15.330
Yes.

04:15.350 --> 04:15.670
Really?

04:17.152 --> 04:23.762
And how did you feel about your grades compared to your classmates?

04:25.405 --> 04:28.910
Oh, I never paid any attention to it a great deal.

04:30.432 --> 04:40.227
I think, I think I finished, I don't know, maybe

04:42.063 --> 04:47.551
second or third or fourth in my class.

04:47.731 --> 04:50.194
How many of the 64 graduated?

04:50.234 --> 04:52.117
Do you remember?

04:53.359 --> 04:59.087
I think probably all but one or two.

04:59.568 --> 05:01.190
That sounds remarkably good.

05:02.231 --> 05:03.854
Was that unusual for that era?

05:05.316 --> 05:09.421
Oh, it depended on classes.

05:09.481 --> 05:11.344
The first class I taught

05:12.725 --> 05:21.417
I think I lost 13 out of the 64 in my course.

05:24.302 --> 05:29.028
So it kind of depends what course, you know, the level they came in.

05:31.852 --> 05:37.821
What did those two years in the Air Force mean to your academic success here?

05:38.088 --> 05:53.987
Oh, I think just two years of maturity, and then I was a section chief, which I had 21 people or so working for me in the Air Force, and I think that's just a

05:56.549 --> 06:01.803
growing up process, management, time management.

06:05.051 --> 06:11.588
Looking back on vet school, to which of the veterinary faculty do you feel most grateful

06:12.428 --> 06:17.135
for their role in your career, in your development?

06:17.155 --> 06:30.994
Oh, I think, you know, Dr. Price and Dr. Burns and Dr. Mellif and Dr. Turk and Dr. Leonard and Dr. Beamer and Dr. Hilton Smith, probably.

06:33.927 --> 06:49.168
As you were getting... Dr. Davis, Richard Davis, Dr. McMurray, all those, we didn't have that many professors.

06:51.038 --> 06:59.066
And the emphasis was real-world veterinary medicine as compared to research.

06:59.547 --> 07:00.568
Oh, yeah, yeah.

07:01.709 --> 07:08.596
Research was really not even discussed or thought of.

07:09.577 --> 07:20.809
What were the primary problems that are veterinary medicine, like brucellosis and what were the primary worries then in Texas veterinary medicine?

07:22.223 --> 07:24.403
whole

07:27.387 --> 07:30.030
Really not, not very much.

07:30.130 --> 07:35.297
They had pretty well conquered the tick problems.

07:35.477 --> 07:41.785
And Bruce Losis, well, TB had pretty well killed out.

07:43.247 --> 07:53.800
And Bruce Losis was coming along in the initial testing program.

07:53.780 --> 08:06.012
Biologics had been developed for vaccinating for distemper and hepatitis and a number of the small animal conditions.

08:06.032 --> 08:17.884
And leptospirosis was a thing that was of some import back at that time.

08:17.984 --> 08:23.449
And they had found that tetocycline was effective in the treatment.

08:24.256 --> 08:39.696
So there were not any real problems, and we had antibiotics that were effective against most infectious diseases.

08:39.776 --> 08:47.766
So there weren't any real big problems that couldn't be treated.

08:49.805 --> 08:58.557
So as you were getting ready to get out of school, did the vet school help you find that first job?

08:58.577 --> 09:05.826
No, we didn't have any kind of placement or anything.

09:05.846 --> 09:13.516
Usually on spring break everybody went around and started looking for a job.

09:13.636 --> 09:14.918
That was about it.

09:14.898 --> 09:24.769
Now, you joined that man in his practice, and what was your, did he pay you a salary?

09:25.450 --> 09:29.074
What was that, I'm not going to ask any other salary, what was that beginning salary?

09:30.815 --> 09:31.256
Do you remember?

09:34.399 --> 09:39.505
I want to guess probably around

09:40.733 --> 09:43.337
$200 or $300 a month.

09:43.477 --> 10:00.203
I came to work at A&M as an instructor in 1950, no, 1959 or so.

10:00.304 --> 10:05.712
I came to work as an instructor at $300 a month.

10:06.232 --> 10:17.001
In your practice of veterinary medicine, did you run into some reality situations for which the vet school had not prepared you at all?

10:17.892 --> 10:19.074
Not really.

10:19.795 --> 10:29.991
I felt, in fact, I guess we instilled in our graduates, not that I didn't learn a lot in practice.

10:30.092 --> 10:37.183
I mean, Dr. Cobbin was very helpful and taught me a whole lot, but you leave,

10:37.163 --> 10:41.228
leave school with the idea that you can do anything.

10:42.329 --> 10:48.136
And that's really so unique about a veterinarian.

10:48.357 --> 11:03.475
You go out and there's nothing in large animal, small animal, that you don't feel like you can conquer, you feel like you can do surgery, you can treat medical situations.

11:03.455 --> 11:08.179
And I never had any real big problems.

11:12.303 --> 11:13.865
It's hard to believe.

11:13.905 --> 11:23.414
I don't know whether our graduates go out like that now, but at that time you felt like you could do any of it and did it all.

11:25.956 --> 11:30.981
Okay, we're on the downhill slope now.

11:33.492 --> 11:42.642
The emphasis here was on professionalism and real world and so forth.

11:43.503 --> 11:59.179
If you were giving advice, if you could look back and say to that faculty then, I wish you had given us more of this or that, what would it have been?

12:03.327 --> 12:05.089
In hindsight, is there any?

12:06.111 --> 12:06.792
Oh, I don't.

12:08.494 --> 12:19.288
I really thought that core of professors we had and the knowledge base that they provided us, I didn't feel like.

12:19.308 --> 12:24.795
I felt like we had everything we could possibly have.

12:24.775 --> 12:42.714
And it depends on the individual, of course, but most veterinarians go into business for themselves, or lots did, and they probably would have preferred having more business training, but I never found that a problem.

12:44.677 --> 12:46.579
Back to your class's makeup.

12:47.059 --> 12:48.220
Now, they were all male.

12:48.661 --> 12:50.383
Were they all Anglo?

12:50.643 --> 12:54.327
Were there any minority of any Hispanic?

12:54.307 --> 13:00.637
There were maybe one Hispanic.

13:01.799 --> 13:02.861
No internationals.

13:03.963 --> 13:05.766
No.

13:05.786 --> 13:09.152
And geographically they were scattered across the state?

13:09.352 --> 13:11.876
Yes.

13:11.896 --> 13:17.045
And when they went out to their first jobs, did they by and large stay within the state?

13:18.627 --> 13:19.048
Yes.

13:22.353 --> 13:23.014
Let's see.

13:24.036 --> 13:24.998
What have we left out?

13:26.561 --> 13:27.703
Oh, let me see.

13:27.943 --> 13:31.089
I think... Particularly about Vetscu.

13:34.195 --> 13:36.339
Not a lot.

13:36.619 --> 13:44.614
I know that the

13:46.315 --> 14:12.762
type of class makeup and the level of education that the students get now as far as, you know, course materials and things are so much superior to what they were in the 1950s.

14:15.121 --> 14:18.646
The advances in medicine have been tremendous.

14:19.287 --> 14:25.898
And I'll bet the difficulty to get admitted, rigor, I'll bet that.

14:25.918 --> 14:31.206
Yeah, it's more difficult to get in, I suppose.

14:31.186 --> 14:40.151
And the kids are taught so much more.

14:40.171 --> 14:46.849
I mean, well, it's just been unbelievable what's happened in medicine last year.

14:46.829 --> 15:02.166
as far as new drugs and new diagnostic techniques and nuclear medicine and electrobiology and immunology and the whole bit.

15:02.326 --> 15:12.837
It's how it can keep progressing, I don't know, but I'm sure it will with all of the

15:12.817 --> 15:21.408
genetic interventions and the things that are going to take place.

15:27.555 --> 15:33.222
What are the qualities of being a Texas Aggie?

15:34.484 --> 15:38.955
I can't speak to this generation.

15:38.976 --> 15:50.485
I hope it has stayed pure, so to speak, and that is that

15:52.338 --> 16:11.713
I think in my day and time we were always, Aggies were always considered to be, you know, underdogs, so to speak.

16:11.693 --> 16:30.478
And many of us that came at that time came from very poor families and backgrounds, and we were underdogs when we came here, and came from the wrong side of the track, so to speak.

16:30.458 --> 16:56.179
We kind of lived together and fought together, and it was a situation that if you're going to survive, you had to be very close to one another because there wasn't anybody else going to help you.

16:56.159 --> 16:58.942
I think you built that camaraderie.

17:01.345 --> 17:02.105
What builds it?

17:02.526 --> 17:06.370
What are the events and what are the activities that create that camaraderie?

17:08.792 --> 17:22.487
Oh, I think it's, again, a single belief that

17:23.024 --> 17:40.999
You stand as a group and you're kind of opposed by everybody else.

17:40.979 --> 17:44.983
You either stand or you won't make it.

17:45.203 --> 18:09.484
And I think the fact you, well, you can't, you know, say if you go through a military type organization all that period of time and you work together every day, seven days a week like you do, or used to do when you were all in the Corps of Cadets.

18:09.464 --> 18:35.256
survive, and you have lots of reason to believe that if a fellow, if a person's a graduate of the Texas A&M, he's been through a pretty tough and rigorous lifestyle.

18:36.718 --> 18:36.838
Okay.

18:36.858 --> 18:38.340
I've got three questions left.

18:39.974 --> 18:43.020
What has it meant to you that you attended Texas A&M?

18:43.081 --> 18:44.724
What effect has it had on your life?

18:45.886 --> 18:58.032
Well, I think my whole, everything I have and everything I've done has been, has been a result of coming here to school.

18:58.172 --> 18:59.535
I mean, if I'd left,

18:59.515 --> 19:04.384
school and gone to work for mobile oil in the field.

19:07.490 --> 19:19.093
I don't know what would have occurred, but my whole professional development,

19:19.073 --> 19:34.197
family and family values and my feel for my country and for everything else, I think, as a result of having come today.

19:35.054 --> 19:35.695
Okay.

19:36.396 --> 19:50.672
If someone walked up to you and gave you a check for a million dollars with only one restriction on it, that you had to pass that check on to A&M, what would you tell A&M you wanted them to do with that?

19:51.033 --> 20:00.724
In other words, if you had the capability to make a major addition to Texas A&M's capability, what would you want it to be?

20:00.704 --> 20:09.988
Oh, I think to... I'll see.

20:11.099 --> 20:39.672
scholarships for people that are capable students, but not necessarily the top scholastic altogether, I think, based on needs, and to make rewards for good teaching.

20:39.652 --> 20:44.633
and I feel

20:48.258 --> 21:03.537
sense of achievement and having just gotten a million dollars for a chair in teaching, which I guess would be the first ever.

21:04.658 --> 21:10.165
Because the teachers, especially in veterinary medicine, were your small group.

21:10.145 --> 21:26.928
The teachers, moral and integrity and everything, ethics, are so important.

21:28.189 --> 21:36.220
Because if you don't go out here with the right ethics and morals,

21:37.381 --> 21:39.704
you've lost out, I think.

21:40.204 --> 21:43.748
Was that emphasized, do you think, appropriately when you were a student?

21:43.868 --> 21:44.309
Oh, yeah.

21:44.409 --> 21:54.380
I think, as I keep naming off these seven or eight, nine professors, they lived a life of example.

21:55.040 --> 21:58.224
I mean, they're just people that you looked up to.

21:58.524 --> 22:03.810
I mean, they were just great, great kind of people.

22:03.790 --> 22:08.735
So the last question, what feelings do you hold in your heart for Texas A&M today?

22:10.317 --> 22:17.064
Oh, I guess I kind of live and die still with A&M.

22:17.245 --> 22:19.607
I see that changes have been made.

22:19.867 --> 22:26.895
I've not always been happy with

22:26.875 --> 22:38.950
with some of the things that they've done, people they've hired and different things, but that part doesn't worry me.

22:39.491 --> 22:49.643
I think more about not the internal politics and makeup of the university, but the product that we turn out.

22:49.623 --> 22:58.432
And I think we turn out a unique and good product, and I'm still real proud of that.

22:58.533 --> 23:02.907
And it seems that the traditions and

23:03.899 --> 23:15.445
academic standards have been maintained, even with the fact that our student body mix has changed and our size has changed.

23:16.327 --> 23:19.815
So, I'm still real proud of the university.
