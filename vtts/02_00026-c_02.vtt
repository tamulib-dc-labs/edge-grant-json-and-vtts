00:02.242 --> 00:04.426
I'm not a hunter, but some did.

00:05.227 --> 00:10.477
Somebody was always bringing the carcass in and doing the cleaning in the showers and stuff.

00:10.717 --> 00:12.581
The authorities didn't like that.

00:12.801 --> 00:15.186
The commandant would be a lot upset.

00:15.246 --> 00:19.534
It was amusing to me to learn later from Bob Cobb that he and Dittman used to do stuff like that.

00:20.355 --> 00:22.499
I said, I can't imagine you doing that.

00:23.020 --> 00:25.785
I think Dittman would do it in a minute.

00:25.765 --> 00:29.915
Oh, this, while they were high-ranking people.

00:29.975 --> 00:33.704
Calm was the vice president, and Dittman was a professor of military science.

00:34.927 --> 00:40.922
Because I've gotten two or three good bull stories about how they were able to...

00:41.577 --> 00:53.312
hide the carcass when the sophomores were looking for it, then smuggle it over to the dining hall to get it cooked and so forth.

00:54.473 --> 01:11.314
As you now realize it in your role here and at other institutions, who were some role model leaders in your student years at A&M that you learned from?

01:12.661 --> 01:17.368
Well, of course, the Corps commanders were always people you looked up to, just really revered.

01:18.229 --> 01:23.497
This carpenter person I mentioned was an exceptional person.

01:24.679 --> 01:31.709
Jack Lunsford was one of my heroes really all my life, and he still is, just really an exceptional individual.

01:33.211 --> 01:39.360
But all of the real heroes I had in the student sense were the student leaders here on campus during that time.

01:39.340 --> 01:49.755
Were there any academic or administrative people that you learned anything from that you were able to apply later?

01:51.811 --> 01:54.215
Yeah, but really these were as a graduate student.

01:54.675 --> 01:56.378
Not so much as an undergraduate.

01:56.979 --> 02:00.404
Samang was someone I had great respect for.

02:00.944 --> 02:08.896
His physical presence, the way he presented himself, and how he dealt with people in a very straightforward way.

02:09.076 --> 02:15.085
All of those things were, I think, looking back on it were, I guess, small lessons.

02:15.065 --> 02:25.784
The opportunity, even though they certainly were not unfriendly, the opportunity to sit down and talk to a professor in those days was somehow my lifestyle and theirs just weren't the same.

02:25.804 --> 02:29.170
I was so focused on all these other things going on in the Corps.

02:30.312 --> 02:37.545
They knew me, my professors all seemed to like me, and I made good grades so they knew about me in that context.

02:38.032 --> 02:45.184
Right now, I get the impression your grades went up as your responsibilities went up.

02:45.364 --> 02:47.207
Yeah, they sort of did.

02:47.768 --> 02:51.354
They went up by the second semester of my sophomore year.

02:51.454 --> 02:55.380
I was an honor student and managed to perpetuate that.

02:55.400 --> 03:02.031
Now, as you were getting ready to graduate with your undergraduate degree, what did you think you were going to do professionally the rest of your life?

03:02.298 --> 03:04.401
Well, I thought I would be an engineer.

03:04.481 --> 03:06.123
I'd work for somebody as an engineer.

03:06.183 --> 03:13.132
And I decided to go to Caltech, get a master's degree, just to give me a leg up on that career.

03:13.933 --> 03:20.382
And sort of mid-year there, I began to realize that there was a heck of a lot more I could learn if I stayed in school.

03:21.063 --> 03:22.965
So I started thinking about getting a PhD.

03:23.386 --> 03:25.248
Sally got pregnant with my son.

03:26.110 --> 03:29.234
And coming back to A&M, Samang tried to convince me to come back.

03:29.294 --> 03:31.697
And it was just too good a deal to turn down.

03:31.677 --> 03:36.589
Probably a mistake to do it, but it's not a major mistake.

03:36.829 --> 03:38.092
So you came back when?

03:38.653 --> 03:40.859
In 59, a year later.

03:41.200 --> 03:44.387
I went to Caltech a year, came back here, got my PhD in two years.

03:44.654 --> 03:45.936
So you and I arrived.

03:46.637 --> 03:48.179
I got here in September of 59.

03:48.379 --> 03:52.104
I came in July of 59.

03:52.584 --> 03:54.607
Started the second semester of summer school.

03:55.408 --> 03:59.854
Graduated in Caltech in one year with a master's degree.

04:00.194 --> 04:03.979
And my son was born that following December.

04:04.550 --> 04:05.071
Was O.C.

04:05.091 --> 04:08.015
Cooper your family physician?

04:08.276 --> 04:09.858
Sally's father was a doctor.

04:10.239 --> 04:11.901
He passed away many years ago.

04:12.582 --> 04:16.168
One of our first family fights was where that little boy was going to be born.

04:17.810 --> 04:19.933
My mother-in-law sort of led the charge.

04:20.134 --> 04:21.516
I liked to argue with her.

04:21.996 --> 04:24.640
I can remember my father never said very much.

04:24.680 --> 04:25.482
He was hard of hearing.

04:26.043 --> 04:28.046
He was very quiet.

04:28.987 --> 04:32.312
At that point, he was...

04:32.292 --> 04:34.035
70 years old, something like that.

04:34.055 --> 04:34.836
Still practicing.

04:34.937 --> 04:35.818
Very good surgeon.

04:35.918 --> 04:36.740
Highly regarded.

04:37.341 --> 04:40.045
He was a bum-bright surgeon, for example.

04:41.207 --> 04:45.294
He looked at me and said, I really think you ought to let her come up here to have the baby.

04:45.996 --> 04:49.221
That kind of resolved it.

04:49.201 --> 04:54.272
What other topics have we left out that you think of?

04:54.493 --> 04:56.617
I can't think of anything.

04:56.637 --> 04:59.323
You know, the Bear Bryant period and some of the things he did.

04:59.443 --> 05:05.657
Oh, that senior year.

05:05.637 --> 05:07.439
Losing the last three games.

05:08.441 --> 05:13.587
What did that do to the spirit of how did you folks feel?

05:13.607 --> 05:16.611
Well, we felt betrayed because he was leaving.

05:17.492 --> 05:21.217
Hagler and I had heard from Harrington that Bear was very likely going to leave.

05:22.619 --> 05:26.764
I think the interesting athletic story is probably one you've heard and know.

05:26.824 --> 05:33.433
It's the involvement of the student body in hiring Myers, the next coach, Jim Myers.

05:33.413 --> 05:41.746
They had the usual search committee with the great involvement of Regents and everything looking for a coach.

05:41.907 --> 05:47.195
They went after the Navy coach, Eddie Erteletz, I think his name was.

05:47.476 --> 05:54.527
Frank Leahy was talked into coming out of retirement and his doctor intervened.

05:54.507 --> 06:00.777
Leahy wanted to come as athletic director and bring a young guy named Persejan as a coach.

06:01.759 --> 06:06.126
Our A&M folks said, no, we want somebody that's established.

06:07.028 --> 06:08.791
You've heard all those stories.

06:09.492 --> 06:12.497
They focused on the Iowa State coach, Jim Myers.

06:13.599 --> 06:17.205
They had some conversations with him, and somehow it fell apart.

06:17.245 --> 06:19.148
I don't remember why.

06:19.128 --> 06:24.718
The students then began to get alarmed about how long it was taking and so forth and so on.

06:25.339 --> 06:27.362
So they got interested in Myers.

06:27.843 --> 06:34.555
Hagler, and I'm blanking on his name now, the editor of the Bat then, went to Iowa State.

06:34.535 --> 06:37.762
Somebody gave him some money and they just took off and went up there.

06:38.684 --> 06:44.216
They showed up at Meyer's house one night and convinced him to renew his interest in A&M.

06:45.819 --> 06:52.273
There was some coordination with the athletic committee and maybe even with Harrington.

06:52.253 --> 06:56.262
At the end of the day, Myers got re-engaged and took the job.

06:57.424 --> 07:00.892
He was sent a telegram from here with thousands of names on it.

07:01.132 --> 07:03.457
It was one of these chain telegrams and stuff.

07:05.081 --> 07:08.929
Myers showed up at an A&M football game here last year.

07:08.909 --> 07:11.192
And I'd never met him, really.

07:11.452 --> 07:14.236
I'd seen him when he came on campus when he got the job.

07:15.258 --> 07:17.601
And he, of course, he remembers all of this.

07:17.701 --> 07:20.545
It turned out that Hagler was on campus the same time.

07:20.625 --> 07:28.175
So it was kind of an interesting moment when they saw each other as a... And it was that student enthusiasm that attracted him, wasn't it?

07:29.296 --> 07:29.397
Yeah.

07:29.417 --> 07:31.980
Of course, he was not successful here either.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.625
And it started a chain of events until Stallings came.

07:36.871 --> 07:42.861
All right then, I've got two questions left.

07:45.546 --> 07:52.618
If someone walked up to you and handed you a million dollar check,

07:52.801 --> 08:03.846
that you were to pass on to A&M, but you decide what's to be done with it, what would be your favorite personal thing to do for A&M?

08:04.407 --> 08:08.717
Oh, I would endow the second chair in music or one in the English department.

08:09.271 --> 08:11.136
Music or English.

08:11.156 --> 08:23.027
I'd put it somewhere where it would make a difference and it would send sort of the message to those faculties that they are very important to us and what they do is very important to us.

08:23.935 --> 08:25.078
Alright, then the last question.

08:25.138 --> 08:28.646
What feelings do you carry in your heart for Texas A&M?

08:29.308 --> 08:30.871
Well, I love the place.

08:30.971 --> 08:33.798
I don't think I'm very typical in that respect.

08:33.878 --> 08:36.164
It has not always been the case.

08:36.304 --> 08:42.298
I loved it when I was a student the following years, but I really drifted far away.

08:42.278 --> 08:46.202
and never thought I'd have the opportunity to come back.

08:46.282 --> 08:48.204
I mean, it was beyond my imagination.

08:49.205 --> 08:54.151
When I was at Rice, or when I was really anywhere, I was definitely engaged in that place.

08:54.171 --> 09:02.419
Whether it was Kentucky, Oklahoma State, and A&M was way, way out of my mind when the opportunity came to come back here.

09:03.140 --> 09:06.824
So it's kind of the bookends in my life as I'm young and I'm old.

09:07.425 --> 09:08.826
So A&M's a very special place.

09:09.903 --> 09:20.080
Meeting the same set of people as old men that I knew when I was young is really a kind of an interesting way to spend a life.

09:20.701 --> 09:21.623
It's been very special.

09:22.444 --> 09:27.473
And the Aggies, frankly, the ones I love the most are the John Lindsay generation.

09:27.453 --> 09:34.404
my bright generation, those really old guys that were affected by World War II and we're beginning to lose now.

09:35.185 --> 09:45.581
And to be with them in the context of A&M is just too much fun, almost more fun than a human ought to be allowed to have.

09:46.102 --> 09:47.785
I just really get turned on by them.

09:47.805 --> 09:51.891
Some of the grumpy, crotchety old guys, I just have a ball with them, you know.

09:54.075 --> 09:54.856
Let's quit with that.

09:55.056 --> 09:55.637
Let's blend it.
