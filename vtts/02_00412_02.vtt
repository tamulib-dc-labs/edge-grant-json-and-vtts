When the abortion came out, it was when Obregón was 
deposed from the government and the persecution

00:01.499 --> 00:10.830
against us began. So I, Rolando, went to Cuba. Yes. 
And I stayed in Puebla, publishing my newspaper,

00:16.717 --> 00:25.667
fighting Practically with Morones, right? But 
then Morones put all the strength of the Red

00:29.545 --> 00:37.854
Syndicates on me and that's when it all started. 
And do you

00:40.016 --> 00:51.368
make visits or holidays in Mexico since you went to 
Texas? ¿Cómo? ¿Usted hacía vacaciones en México

00:53.188 --> 00:57.563
en estos años pasados? No, no. Voy y vengo. I have 
family, I go, I stay there for a few days, and then I

01:02.468 --> 01:07.153
come back here. But I don't get involved in 
politics anymore. I have friends with all of them.

01:15.823 --> 01:20.528
Wherever I go, I have friends, but I don't get 
involved anymore. Here, I am a consul. I am an

01:23.412 --> 01:25.754
honorary consul. But with the condition that I 
don't get involved anymore. It's a title like all

01:30.802 --> 01:36.107
of those.

01:38.810 --> 01:40.192
All of those. Oh, this. The National University. 
Yes. Well, your life was very interesting. Yes,

01:51.463 --> 01:55.547
but in a word, it's very difficult. I have a lot, 
but... A pesar de que tengo imprenta, no puedo

01:59.843 --> 02:06.754
hacer mis memorias. Tengo conferencias y 
declaraciones y trabajos y todo, sobre todo las

02:07.876 --> 02:23.100
cuestiones de los cursos, que para mí, pues, es un 
verdadero... una verdadera satisfacción haber

02:23.485 --> 02:37.199
logrado que México tuviera aquí una 
representación como latino.

02:37.219 --> 02:39.642
Bueno, muchísimas gracias para todo. Pues, si 
alguna

02:40.423 --> 02:50.033
vez puedo to provide you with a copy of my work. Yes. 
You can send it to your address, I don't know where.

03:01.626 --> 03:01.707
Yes. I have several conferences that I have 
printed, although I don't have them in print yet,

03:02.307 --> 03:18.231
but I can send you copies of what I have, of the most 
important articles. Because it's very difficult

03:20.320 --> 03:31.937
to condense a work that is at least 35 or 40 years 
old. It's a series.

03:37.846 --> 03:46.058
But I think

03:37.846 --> 03:46.058
the main works can be used El reconocimiento es. 
Ah, ¿quiere para mí leer esto? It's for usted. Sí,

03:55.090 --> 03:56.393
bueno. Muchas gracias. ¿Y esto no? También. Oh, 
también. Pues muchas gracias, señor. Muchísimas

04:03.351 --> 04:04.333
gracias.
