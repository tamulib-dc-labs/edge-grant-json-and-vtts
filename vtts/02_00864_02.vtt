00:02.782 --> 00:07.450
Ruth, were you or your sisters ever sick out of the 
mines? No, sir. With malaria or anything? No, sir.

00:10.254 --> 00:11.516
Were any of the other families? No, sir. Anything 
but that. I see. So the doctor didn't come out there

00:14.481 --> 00:17.045
very often? Yes, sir. He did or did not? No, he come 
to the houses. I see. Just to check you over? Yes,

00:23.035 --> 00:23.456
sir. To see the patient. I see. And did you have to 
pay for that visit or did Mr. Goodman? Yes, sir. He

00:28.424 --> 00:29.886
has to pay every one. Do you

00:30.710 --> 00:37.537
remember how much he had to pay? About three 
dollars every time he came to the house.

00:45.445 --> 00:48.288
Do you remember the name of that doctor? Dr. 
Barkley.

00:52.712 --> 00:56.616
You said that you met your husband when you were Oh, 
between 28 and 32. Yes, sir. At the nursing home.

01:02.242 --> 01:02.522
Right. And then you got married, and then you moved 
here to Rockdale? Yes, sir. And then what did you do

01:08.168 --> 01:11.132
together, you and your husband? Well, I still work 
in an arrest home, and my husband, he have a nice

01:11.152 --> 01:15.536
job. And I built a new house, me and my husband. You 
and your husband built this house? Yes. From

01:22.284 --> 01:22.964
scratch? Right. Did friends come over and help you 
at all? No, sir. Just the two of you? That's right.

01:29.452 --> 01:31.535
And you didn't have Raymond and Junior to help you? 
Raymond, he helped a little bit, yes. Where did

01:35.702 --> 01:42.534
your husband pick up the ability to build a house? 
Because he worked in the railroad. He worked in the

01:44.737 --> 01:45.679
railroad. Yes, sir, and he gave us this. Did your 
husband come from Mexico? No, sir, my husband...

01:53.600 --> 01:54.562
Waco. From Waco. Yes, it's our own town. Were his 
parents from Mexico? No, sir. Waco. And he

02:03.300 --> 02:05.104
finished the school in Waco.

02:08.170 --> 02:09.212
When You said you did not go to school at all. Yes. 
Because my mother, she didn't have the money to

02:13.652 --> 02:16.796
send me to school. Sometimes I cried because I 
asked her for other reasons. She didn't want me to

02:21.923 --> 02:23.625
go to school. She said, daughter, I don't have the 
money for you to go to school. So the miners, the

02:29.032 --> 02:35.521
mining people had to pay the school to send their 
children to school. Yes. Were some of the miners

02:37.223 --> 02:38.625
children's? Able to go to school? Yes. I see. Do you 
remember where that school was? In Rockdale. In

02:45.802 --> 02:46.403
Rockdale. Okay. Well, how did you learn your 
English? I mean, you talk very good English. Well,

02:53.373 --> 02:58.240
I started to miss a lot of friends, and I started to 
learn. You picked it up from the children who were

02:58.881 --> 03:01.385
going to school? Yes. I see. Yes. Did... Your 
father, Joe Mendoza, was from Mexico. Yes, sir.

03:11.743 --> 03:13.345
And... Hello. Good evening. Howdy. How do you do? 
Pretty good. Moving right along here.

03:22.717 --> 03:25.961
He was from Mexico, and he was a boss man at mines. 
Yes, sir. Did he... You know, I asked you this

03:27.643 --> 03:31.107
before, if he... kept up some of the old ways from 
Mexico? Yes, sir. What kind of things did he do? Did

03:41.557 --> 03:44.561
he retain the same religion, for instance? No, 
sir. He never changed anything. He never changed

03:47.384 --> 03:49.286
anything from Mexico? No, sir. Was he a Catholic in 
Mexico? Yes, sir. I see. Are you a Catholic now?

03:54.871 --> 03:55.472
Yes, sir. I see. And all my family. OK. Do you 
remember any of the other miners that changed from

03:58.745 --> 04:03.149
Catholicism to another church? No, sir. No, sir. 
Because we've gotten reports that some of them

04:04.750 --> 04:10.495
became Baptists, but everybody at the Boniva mine 
remained. Yes, right. Did you have a church at the

04:12.497 --> 04:14.258
mining camp? No, sir. He came to town.

04:20.083 --> 04:21.525
The priest came from town? Yes, sir. And you held 
church at the mining camp? Yes, sir. Did you hold it

04:24.787 --> 04:26.229
outside? Yes, outside. I see. What would happen 
when it was raining or cold? Did you just not have

04:30.524 --> 04:31.906
church? That's right. He don't have it.

04:39.439 --> 04:46.330
One thing I forgot when we were talking about 
feeding, what kind of food that you had, were you

04:39.439 --> 04:46.330
able to get a supply of milk at all? Yes, sir. Did Mr. 
Panera have cows there? Yes, sir. He had cows. He

04:53.461 --> 04:54.503
sold the milk. He sold the milk? Yes. I see. Do you 
remember how much he told you? No, sir.

05:02.585 --> 05:07.552
Did you ever hear your father, Joe Mendoza, 
complain about working in the mines? No, sir. I

05:08.073 --> 05:09.254
never hear anything. What was his attitude toward 
Mr. Benever? Did he get along with Mr. Benever?

05:15.603 --> 05:16.283
Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Right. Okay.

05:23.288 --> 05:25.470
Did you get married in Rockvale? Yes, sir. I'm 
married in Rockvale.

05:32.598 --> 05:35.561
Do you remember any weddings out at the mine camps? 
You know, other people getting married there? No,

05:38.004 --> 05:38.545
sir. I don't remember anything. Let me

05:40.006 --> 05:45.933
just sort of wrap this up. I pretty much asked you 
everything I wanted to. How do you remember the

05:48.787 --> 05:50.108
mines? You say that sometimes you sit back and just 
think about the mines when you take Raymond or

05:50.248 --> 05:56.755
Junior to town. And you're buying them clothes and 
stuff. And it's a much different lifestyle,

06:00.758 --> 06:04.242
better lifestyle than what you had. What do you 
think about the mines along those lines? Yes,

06:07.685 --> 06:09.747
that's why the reason I remember. Because I don't 
have what he had. And that's why I remember. What

06:17.795 --> 06:19.880
kind of feeling does it give you? Well, an awful 
feeling. An awful feeling? You feel pretty bad

06:23.447 --> 06:24.610
about it? Yes. But I guess you feel good that you and 
your husband have been able to... Oh, yes, because

06:25.873 --> 06:32.427
my family, he has what I don't have. I see.

06:36.015 --> 06:36.175
How's...

06:43.495 --> 06:47.961
You know the way I make the bowls to play me and my 
brothers and my sister? Oh, you made little bowls

06:49.062 --> 06:50.865
to play with? Yes, to play. You know the way I make 
it? No, how did you do that? I steal some rags to my

06:54.469 --> 06:56.111
mother. You took some rags? Uh-huh. And I started 
to make it, me and my brothers and my sister. And I

07:04.062 --> 07:06.124
steal some sacks to my mother. Oh. And look at this 
one, he has two or three paws over there. Yes, that

07:12.208 --> 07:14.231
she bought at the store. Now you see that? Now, you 
wanted to tell me how you made cornbread, and you

07:16.875 --> 07:23.525
wanted to do it in Spanish because you felt like you 
could explain it better. Yes. Okay. So this is how

07:26.570 --> 07:32.098
you and your mother made cornbread out of limes, 
right?

07:37.107 --> 07:43.755
I'll be able to understand some of

07:37.107 --> 07:43.755
it now. Got a little bit. Go through the process of 
how you made the cornmeal. Was cornmeal fairly...

07:49.963 --> 07:57.833
Did you eat cornmeal a lot? Uh-huh. In every meal? 
Uh-huh. Pretty much? Okay. So did your mother

08:01.318 --> 08:06.304
taught you how to make the cornmeal? He told me the 
way he cooked, but I never learned. You never

08:09.527 --> 08:10.689
learned it, okay. But you know the description of 
it. You want me to start? Yeah, sure, go ahead. Just

08:17.258 --> 08:18.299
go on. Tell us how your mother made the cornmeal.

08:27.973 --> 08:33.161
It's

08:27.973 --> 08:33.161
so funny. Do you speak Spanish? Yes.

08:41.789 --> 08:48.057
Well,

08:41.789 --> 08:48.057
I'm going to start it in my own language. She cooked 
it, she ground it in the mortar. And she made

08:52.503 --> 08:57.790
tortillas for the family. And she washed it in the 
mill before. She did her chores in the house. Y

09:10.527 --> 09:14.954
este, todo el día ella se preocupaba por su 
familia. Y planchaba con planchas de mano. La

09:20.722 --> 09:22.765
calentaba en la estufa. ¿En la estufa? ¿Qué 
estufa? ¿Stove? ¿Stove? ¿Un stove? Sí. Y un ratito

09:31.198 --> 09:37.868
que tenía ella de descanso, se ponía a tejer, a 
hacernos ropa. Y arreglar la ropa para mi papá, mis

09:40.193 --> 09:43.236
hermanos.

09:46.000 --> 09:49.944
Ella trabaja mucho en estos lugares. Le cocinaba 
al señor Guniver, le hacía tamales, enchiladas,

09:49.964 --> 09:57.152
cuando él pedía.

10:00.056 --> 10:04.200
Y de esa manera pasaba nuestra vida nosotros.

10:08.525 --> 10:10.167
Yeah, I got some of that. You stand up. Muchas 
gracias.

10:17.647 --> 10:25.055
My daddy, he started to make dances in the houses 
and he come a lot of people and have a good time. And

10:26.357 --> 10:31.823
the dances, he stop about one o'clock and 
everybody go home. So people would come from

10:33.205 --> 10:35.447
Rockdale to the dances? Yes. I see. Was that 
usually on the weekends? No, every Saturday.

10:41.073 --> 10:41.734
Every Saturday. Yes. And, well, everybody had a 
good time. For the license, yes. Oh, that's all

10:47.744 --> 10:51.029
right. And, well, nothing happened.

10:58.982 --> 11:05.432
I think, do you remember hearing a story about a 
Model T falling down one of the mine shafts? I

11:06.813 --> 11:11.500
remember that real good, but my daddy, he talking 
about that. He did? Yes. What did he say about it?

11:17.028 --> 11:21.254
No, I don't remember anything. Was there ever any 
contact between the Boniva camp and the other

11:21.274 --> 11:28.904
camps? Did you know people that worked at the other 
mines? No, sir. I don't remember that. One thing I

11:36.817 --> 11:50.694
noticed when we were walking over the mines last 
week was that at the Boniva mine, the railroads

11:36.817 --> 11:50.694
seemed to be fairly far away from where the miners 
lived. Is that true? Yes, sir. Right. Did the

11:54.598 --> 11:56.400
railroads keep you up at night? No, sir. I couldn't 
hear anything. Because at some of the other mines,

12:00.305 --> 12:03.168
the camps were closer to the railroads. Yes, sir. I 
understand that. No, I never hear anything. Did

12:06.905 --> 12:11.791
you ever see Mr. Ginniver yourself, or did you just 
hear about him? No, sir. I have years and years I

12:12.793 --> 12:15.336
never see him. Somebody else told me he saw him in 
San Antonio. I see. And I never tried to go there and

12:20.423 --> 12:23.767
see him. I don't know if he still lives or not. Well, 
I think he's passed away. You said that you had a

12:36.385 --> 12:43.072
table and two chairs, and yet you had your mother, 
your father, and your sisters. When you ate, did

12:44.954 --> 12:49.779
your mother and father sit in the chairs and you sit 
on the beds? Yes, or sometimes,

12:49.799 --> 12:59.930
yes.

13:00.110 --> 13:00.310
Right. Did you have any chores that your mother had 
you doing during the day? Nothing.

13:08.768 --> 13:11.752
Did you have to weed the garden or anything? Yes, 
sometimes.

13:16.720 --> 13:21.246
Did anybody ever come through the camp selling 
watermelons? Yes, sometimes. Some people would

13:23.209 --> 13:25.052
come over there. He was selling nickel. Were you 
all ever able to buy that? Yes,

13:29.999 --> 13:36.328
sir. Did any of your friends at the mines meet their 
husbands or wives at the mines and get married?

13:44.739 --> 13:48.743
There were different families living at the mine. 
Was a daughter from one family ever marry a son from

13:48.763 --> 13:54.270
another? Yes, there's a lot of families. And yet, 
you went all the way to Waco to meet your husband.

14:03.520 --> 14:03.700
Yes, sir. That's kind of unusual, I guess. We met in 
the hospital. You met in

14:11.787 --> 14:17.413
the hospital? I see. Do you keep in contact with any 
people that you grew up with at Des Moines? Yes,

14:22.819 --> 14:23.340
sir. Where do they live now? He live in Rockdale, 
Miss Mireles. Morales? Joe Mireles. Jose?

14:33.091 --> 14:33.231
Mm-hmm. And Tomas, Manu, Campos. Did they all live 
in Rockdale? Yes, sir. He still lived. Where did,

14:46.581 --> 14:52.833
not everybody from the mine stayed in the Rockdale 
area when they shut down, did they? No, sir.

14:53.314 --> 14:55.799
Somebody left the Waco. Waco. Did they go anywhere 
else?

15:07.130 --> 15:08.936
Well, I can't think of anything else. I mean, we've 
covered all the food and the clothes and

15:09.017 --> 15:13.131
everything like that. So, muchas gracias por 
tiempo. Gracias también.
