00:02.478 --> 00:11.548
I remember when we were sophomores, there were 
three of us in a room, Dummy McLaren, Hudson Van

00:02.478 --> 00:11.548
Lone, and I. And Dummy was a real prankster. And one 
time, and everybody in the battery knew that Dummy

00:15.913 --> 00:20.998
was. And

00:21.379 --> 00:32.451
one time, the seniors were having a meeting in the 
captain's room, and Dummy tied a rope on the door

00:33.106 --> 00:39.312
handle and affixed it to another door handle. And 
then he threw a huge firecracker through the

00:40.313 --> 00:46.420
transom into the middle of this meeting. And it 
took the seniors some time to come to break that

00:47.861 --> 01:02.556
door down, but they immediately came to our room 
and Dummy was acting innocently, reading a

00:47.861 --> 01:02.556
magazine on his bunk. And they just grabbed him, 
they knew who it was, and dragged him out and we

01:02.975 --> 01:13.178
heard the boards popping.

01:14.160 --> 01:15.263
And nobody was hurt? Nobody was hurt, right. 
Former students, faculty, friends, advisors, to

01:18.550 --> 01:27.503
what Aggies do you feel the greatest depths of 
gratitude now? Of my own self. To whom are you most

01:32.150 --> 01:37.958
grateful for what they did for you in shaping your 
life? I would think

01:38.439 --> 01:48.253
Coach Anderson, character builder, track team 
coach. J.P. Abbott, English professor, tennis

01:48.233 --> 01:54.963
coach. John Reed, basketball coach.

02:06.222 --> 02:11.952
And Harold Vance, who was the head of the Petroleum 
Engineering Department. I think those four

02:12.693 --> 02:18.003
people had as much influence on me and them as 
anybody. Do you remember going to any of those

02:18.143 --> 02:27.960
people or anyone else and getting some truly 
meaningful advice, something that you realize

02:18.143 --> 02:27.960
now? Yes, I think Harold Vance. Going to him and 
talking to him about my future in the petroleum

02:32.591 --> 02:43.485
industry and advice he gave me. And

02:43.545 --> 02:48.852
I think it's probably been the Also, I'd say J.P. 
Abbott, in talking to him, I

02:48.832 --> 03:05.136
had always been interested in writing, and so I 
have, the writing has been, I've done a number of, I

03:05.116 --> 03:21.336
have a consulting business, and in doing 
consulting reports, writing is very important.

03:21.316 --> 03:32.915
I think the basics I learned on the applet have been 
very helpful. I and two other guys also wrote a book

03:33.075 --> 03:45.636
called The Dynamic Natural Gas Industry, which 
was published by the University of Oklahoma

03:33.075 --> 03:45.636
Press.

03:45.616 --> 03:52.890
I'd say the basest thing I learned under Alpert 
have been contributed to that. And you never had a

03:53.731 --> 04:03.089
situation that some of us had where you were going 
down this direction academically and you changed

03:53.731 --> 04:03.089
your course and went another direction. No, I 
never have. I knew what I was aiming for and have

04:06.676 --> 04:14.591
been on that road ever since.

04:19.762 --> 04:21.044
What have we overlooked? What have we not 
mentioned that we should have?

04:28.090 --> 04:41.502
I think maybe the subject of women at A&M, we 
mentioned it, but I was very much opposed to women

04:28.090 --> 04:41.502
being admitted to A&M. And I realize now that I was 
wrong, that the the one thing you didn't learn at

04:45.927 --> 04:52.035
A&M, I'd say, was relationship with women. And 
that was the one thing A&M didn't put. And when I was

05:00.104 --> 05:07.834
there, there were daughters of professors could 
go there, and there were six daughters that were in

05:07.814 --> 05:09.396
school at that time. How were they treated? Oh, 
like queens, of course. But I'd say the, of course,

05:14.904 --> 05:36.876
the admittance of women to A&M has made A&M come 
from a very special military school to a first rate

05:14.904 --> 05:36.876
financial, a first rate educational 
institution. Now, that discussion was almost 40

05:37.227 --> 05:40.252
years ago. Right. Why were you at that time opposed 
to coeducation? I thought it would break down the

05:52.955 --> 06:02.497
the bonding that existed and which accounted for 
so many great military guys from A&M. And I thought

06:03.079 --> 06:10.035
that at that time I wanted to see A&M continue as a 
first-rate military academy with a first-rate

06:10.015 --> 06:26.773
educational curriculum. Have you had any family 
members or children of dear friends who've been

06:27.234 --> 06:35.483
A&M coeds? No. No, I haven't. My daughter went to 
Rollins. One of my daughters went to Rollins. And

06:41.991 --> 06:45.436
another daughter went to Texas Tech. But the one 
who went to Rollins in Florida,

06:45.456 --> 06:54.048
they had no football team down there. And she is 
bigger than I am. And I burned out my wife But when I

07:01.619 --> 07:13.261
was president of the association, because having 
to go to all these different events, my wife

07:01.619 --> 07:13.261
finally said, you know, I've just had enough. And 
so my daughter, eldest daughter, has gone to these

07:13.361 --> 07:22.058
different A&M things.

07:23.438 --> 07:35.378
I enjoyed telling the story when, in the same 
place, in an interview with Billy Clayton, he

07:23.438 --> 07:35.378
indicated he had been opposed to coeducation 
also, and I said, why? And he said, I thought that

07:36.039 --> 07:40.146
the women would kill the A&M spirit. Right, right, 
same here. I said, you're kidding. He said, no, I'm

07:42.410 --> 07:43.452
serious. And then he said, well, do the Aggie women 
have any pride? And I said, sir, as far as I can tell,

07:48.380 --> 07:54.730
the coeds now have more pride maybe than the males 
do. He said, good, because I've got three

07:54.770 --> 08:01.320
granddaughters there.

08:01.921 --> 08:05.106
How do you feel about A&M's progress now? I think 
it's excellent. I think the progress is

08:07.890 --> 08:09.632
excellent. I've kept up with A&M by going to 
various meetings and so forth, and I think the

08:09.733 --> 08:19.845
progress is excellent. I do think that the bonfire 
incident sort of shook up everything for a while.

08:30.078 --> 08:42.078
But I think that it's very important as to who the 
new president is.

08:45.003 --> 08:45.984
Last question then. What feelings do you carry in 
your heart for Texas A&M? One of great love and

08:51.458 --> 08:53.922
devotion. You know, it's similar to my feelings 
for my church and my family. As a matter of fact, I

09:04.419 --> 09:13.593
have planned my own funeral, and in the funeral 
I've asked that certain things be played. Amazing

09:14.114 --> 09:15.156
grace. Here I am, Lord. And the Aggie War Hymn, I've 
asked them to play that. Let's quit on that. Tell me

09:26.975 --> 09:39.876
about any of the conversations you remember of the 
former student officers about co-education and

09:26.975 --> 09:39.876
non-compulsory core before you resigned as 
president. Well, the reason I resigned was to run

09:40.767 --> 09:46.213
for governor. But had the former student 
leadership talked about those topics yet?

09:56.103 --> 09:56.804
Well, let's see. Well,

09:56.964 --> 10:04.952
actually, I remember I remember Wofford Cain, who 
was on the Development Fund Board,

10:04.932 --> 10:18.592
he was very much opposed to admitting women. And 
actually, most of my classmates were opposed to

10:19.313 --> 10:27.746
admitting women, just in talking to them. I don't 
remember the But I think as I told you, John Lindsay

10:33.367 --> 10:44.912
told me that he would never forgive me because when 
I resigned to run for governor, he became the

10:33.367 --> 10:44.912
president. And at the first association meeting, 
Earl Rudder said, John, I want you to make a motion

10:45.466 --> 10:55.040
to admit women. And John said, what? He said, make a 
motion, John. Did you know that that was coming up

11:00.549 --> 11:02.892
when you? No, I didn't. I didn't know that. So the 
board, the association board had not discussed

11:05.797 --> 11:08.901
that? No, they didn't know that. And John said that 
He made the motion, and he said, all in favor say

11:13.529 --> 11:22.479
aye, and there were only two or three ayes. All 
opposed say no, and there was a thunderous number

11:23.159 --> 11:26.663
of noes. And he hit the gavel and said, the ayes have 
it. And that's how women were admitted to A&M. And

11:35.373 --> 11:39.537
as I understand it, then they went down the 
hallway. and told the, they were then called

11:39.736 --> 11:48.185
directors, now regents, that the former student 
had adopted that. I see. I didn't know that. That's

11:50.067 --> 11:53.450
what I understood that they did. But this had not 
been a subject of big discussion. No, it hadn't at

11:57.594 --> 11:59.436
that time. You know, there was not planned 
anything, but people were, most of the people I

11:59.596 --> 12:08.005
knew were opposed to it.
