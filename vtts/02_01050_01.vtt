WEBVTT

00:02.731 --> 00:18.848
You had mentioned earlier that

00:02.731 --> 00:18.848
when you're on this training

00:02.731 --> 00:18.848
phase, when you first got to Tinian, that you 
didn't actually have your own plane. That you sort

00:18.868 --> 00:21.411
of went up in whatever was loose. Whatever was 
available. Usually the oldest junker over there.

00:27.437 --> 00:30.200
That's right, the one nobody else... When did you 
get your own plane? We got our own plane

00:32.802 --> 00:51.572
probably after

00:32.802 --> 00:51.572
our eighth mission.

00:51.592 --> 00:52.233
Was that typical?

00:56.339 --> 00:58.843
It just depended on the losses.

01:02.468 --> 01:22.292
Some of the older crews, see we went in as a 
replacement crew, some of the older crews that

01:02.468 --> 01:22.292
were in there,

01:02.468 --> 01:22.292
if

01:02.468 --> 01:22.292
they weren't assigned to fly the mission and their 
plane was available, another crew would fly that

01:02.468 --> 01:22.292
plane.

01:25.076 --> 01:29.421
If it was lost on the mission, then this older crew 
didn't have a plane. Oh, oh. And they got the next

01:31.181 --> 01:33.103
new plane. So seniority kind of thing. So 
seniority. The next new plane came in, coming in,

01:35.406 --> 01:38.289
was theirs. Okay.

01:41.893 --> 01:45.957
So the system took, in your case, eight missions. 
Eight missions. Before you generated enough

01:46.879 --> 01:48.861
seniority to get a plane. To get a plane.

01:52.445 --> 01:54.127
Did you all personalize your plane in any way? We 
didn't name it. It wasn't painted, right? It was

01:59.824 --> 02:00.325
silver? No, it was just silver. Actually,

02:01.786 --> 02:06.470
most of the 29s weren't painted, were they? No, 
there was no paint on them, just the nose art, if

02:07.892 --> 02:11.635
they had any.

02:15.699 --> 02:26.188
When we first went in and they had the coral 
runways,

02:15.699 --> 02:26.188
we'd have to go down occasionally

02:27.232 --> 02:40.006
the whole crew plus the ground crew, and we'd wash 
them to get that coral off the bottom to reduce the

02:27.232 --> 02:40.006
drag on them. I was wondering about that, how you 
wash the planes, because the friends I've got who

02:40.226 --> 02:52.680
are pilots, they go out and wash planes all the 
time, maybe little Cessnas and stuff like that,

02:40.226 --> 02:52.680
because it really matters with a Cessna. You can 
lose 10 miles an hour by having a dirty plane. And a

02:56.915 --> 03:02.900
man with a big old bomber carrying a whole lot of, I 
mean, you didn't want to lose anything,

02:56.915 --> 03:02.900
especially.

03:08.465 --> 03:15.011
But once the runways were paved, that became less 
of a critical issue? Not quite as critical.

03:17.613 --> 03:24.620
Because that car road, if the runways were at least 
a bit damp, it would just stick like cement. Yeah.

03:28.724 --> 03:54.753
We took one night,

03:28.724 --> 03:54.753
we took off,

03:28.724 --> 03:54.753
it was probably about two o'clock in the morning or 
something like that.

03:54.774 --> 03:56.115
Our runways were a little over 10,000 feet long.

04:05.878 --> 04:23.500
We took off on coral runways

04:05.878 --> 04:23.500
and came back 14

04:05.878 --> 04:23.500
hours later and landed on asphalt runways. 
Somebody had been busy. They had worked for months

04:27.230 --> 04:35.019
mining this coral, crushing it, getting it all 
prepared for asphalt. They had mountains of it.

04:37.661 --> 04:47.172
And when we took off, there was just train after 
train of the asphalt pavers and the mixes there. As

04:47.652 --> 04:50.235
soon as we all got off the runways, they started in. 
Hmm. Now was this Army engineer guys who did this?

04:58.839 --> 04:59.259
Seabees. Or Seabees? Construction battalions?

05:06.109 --> 05:06.669
That's impressive. And they had lights

05:06.810 --> 05:18.185
strung out all along there so they could

05:06.810 --> 05:18.185
work at night. We came back, landed in the 
daylight, but on a black runway.

05:26.798 --> 05:29.061
You knew that was going to happen. Oh, yeah. Yeah, 
they were all. Is this the right island? They were

05:33.127 --> 05:37.273
all out there strung out along the runways as we 
were taking off. Yeah.

05:43.322 --> 05:45.566
And the coral was probably a light color, right? 
Oh, yeah, it was white. Yeah. Glare off of it. In

05:50.132 --> 05:54.038
fact, the first time we landed on a coral runway, It 
was a quadulant.

06:00.336 --> 06:03.920
And the pilots really bounced it in there. 
Couldn't find it. Because of the glare coming up

06:06.343 --> 06:09.246
off of it. They weren't used to anything that 
bright. And it put some flat spots on the wheels.

06:17.997 --> 06:18.537
Yeah, I'll bet. I'll bet. How long, or you probably 
wouldn't even necessarily know this, but how long

06:20.159 --> 06:25.105
did those tires last? Seems like they'd be a 
tremendous amount of wear. Many of those, reading

06:28.751 --> 06:33.578
that book, a lot of those planes took off way over 
their low level. Oh, yeah, way, way. And I was

06:35.181 --> 06:42.191
thinking, you know, coming back, you know, you 
could just stray around. It goes, I mean, you'll

06:42.311 --> 06:44.173
get a flat tire or something. I mean, there could be 
some serious stresses and strains on the, not just

06:44.193 --> 06:49.701
the gear, but the tires themselves. We never lost a 
tire. In fact, that landing at Kwajalein, which

06:53.467 --> 06:55.750
we, He bounced him and then came in, came back down 
for the second landing. He had put the brakes on and

07:01.907 --> 07:07.797
tried to hit it that first and it just went up and 
came back down. The wheels weren't turning when he

07:07.837 --> 07:14.809
landed and it kind of skidded for a while and wore 
some black spot. And those tires were changed out.

07:20.047 --> 07:26.594
But other than that, we didn't ourselves 
experience any difficulties with tires. But of

07:26.754 --> 07:28.256
course, it was a problem. Yeah.

07:31.900 --> 07:38.847
Was that, do you think that was sort of a function of 
pilot skill, maybe?

07:38.867 --> 07:40.629
You mean like our instance? Yeah. Well, it was just 
something new. They had never flown in that type of

07:45.190 --> 07:48.333
conditions before. That's not what I meant. What I 
meant was the fact that you didn't have any

07:49.955 --> 07:54.480
problems with your tires. Well, it was just we 
didn't get hit. We didn't get any

07:58.845 --> 08:10.397
anti-aircraft fire or any bullets through or 
anything that damaged one. And the pilots,

08:10.417 --> 08:13.881
usually the pilots They were pretty smooth 
landings.

08:20.241 --> 08:22.343
That was our two oldest crew members. What kind of 
rank were the pilots? Were they captains, majors?

08:27.048 --> 08:28.970
One was a captain, one was first lieutenant. Both 
of them had been infantry officers and

08:30.251 --> 08:36.258
transferred out of the infantry and went to pilot 
training school.

08:40.102 --> 08:43.125
And the airplane commander, who was the captain,

08:43.763 --> 08:49.311
had been in the training command for a while. Once 
he finished pilot training, he stayed in the

08:49.832 --> 09:01.469
training command and was training pilots

08:49.832 --> 09:01.469
in multi-engine stuff. You mentioned also that 
after 15 missions, you went back to the States to go

09:01.509 --> 09:10.583
to lead crew school. What was the significance of 
the 15 missions? A

09:14.358 --> 09:20.286
tour of duty was 35 missions. If you were selected 
for a lead crew, they didn't want you using up those

09:22.789 --> 09:32.141
missions that you had remaining on your tour. When 
you came back, you still had 20 missions that you

09:34.684 --> 09:40.652
could fly as a lead crew.

09:45.813 --> 10:15.432
so once we hit the it was just an arbitrary figure uh 
that they had selected at that time uh

09:45.813 --> 10:15.432
crews to go back to lead crew school they could 
envision that down the line some of the the pilots

09:45.813 --> 10:15.432
that were flying leading the formations in and so 
forth were nearing a tour of duty they needed

09:45.813 --> 10:15.432
replacements yeah there's a perpetual contract 
perpetual thing and uh Our crew was selected to

10:15.766 --> 10:18.949
become a lead crew. But not everyone was, is that 
right? No. I mean that said something about your

10:22.312 --> 10:27.416
crew I would think. Something positive. It was a 
positive action on our, we took it to be very

10:28.658 --> 10:40.228
positive that we were well regarded. Where did you 
go to lead crew school? Muroc. Oh really? On the dry

10:47.608 --> 10:48.249
lake? Dry lake.

10:54.578 --> 10:56.221
It's Edwards Air Force Base now, isn't it? Yeah. 
But we went each crew there at Muroc. And

11:02.070 --> 11:10.883
while we were there was when they dropped the 
atomic bombs.

11:15.554 --> 11:17.556
So you never actually went back? So then we were 
traveling under Class A priority.

11:28.626 --> 11:45.561
And after

11:28.626 --> 11:45.561
the Japanese surrendered, they went under our 
priorities because of military government

11:28.626 --> 11:45.561
personnel going to Japan. had a higher priority

11:46.300 --> 11:55.971
than me.

12:05.682 --> 12:06.703
So what happened after that? Did you ever get back 
to the Pacific? No.

12:11.909 --> 12:16.054
We went to Sacramento.

12:18.160 --> 12:23.125
Hamilton Field and stayed there for about a month.

12:25.867 --> 12:27.048
Three weeks to a month. While they were, the powers 
that be were trying to decide what to do with us. So

12:33.894 --> 12:37.838
they finally sent us to separation centers. 
Where'd you send them? Lackland. Oh, really? They

12:43.824 --> 12:46.066
sent you to the one nearest your home. So I went to 
Lackland. And when was this? This was in, was it

12:49.996 --> 12:52.179
still 45? 45. So you got out in the fall, I guess? I 
got out

12:57.105 --> 13:08.660
in, let's see, that was in.

13:08.680 --> 13:09.741
Bombs were dropped in August. Surrender was 
September. I got out actually in October. Oh,

13:17.408 --> 13:18.690
that's pretty quick. And had final, I had a leave 
up, well into December. So you got paid through up

13:27.464 --> 13:30.228
into December. Okay. The entire time that I was in 
the service, I never had a leave.

13:41.626 --> 13:44.310
It was always from one school to the next,

13:47.328 --> 13:48.229
I did get home. Well, you were in for two years, 
though. A little over two years, about two and a

13:50.973 --> 13:53.918
half. Nearly two and a half years. So there was some 
accumulated leave. And you got out as a one

13:59.546 --> 14:00.768
lieutenant? First lieutenant, yeah.

14:06.356 --> 14:08.559
Did you stay in the reserves or anything after you 
got out? I stayed in the reserves. Got called up in

14:11.924 --> 14:14.568
Korea. No, are you kidding? and

14:17.973 --> 14:26.161
went to Randolph Field.

14:26.181 --> 14:36.972
And because I had flown in B-29s and they were 
training crews on B-29s, I stayed there as an

14:26.181 --> 14:36.972
instructor for 19 months and then got out. I got out 
of the reserves. I got enough of that. What were you

14:42.948 --> 14:44.189
by the time you got out of that? You probably got 
promoted again. No. You didn't sell a first

14:45.971 --> 14:47.833
lieutenant. Because I wasn't staying in. Oh. They 
knew when the 19 months was up that I was gone.

15:01.108 --> 15:04.592
Well, that's interesting. So when you separated, 
you went back to A&M. In January of 46. And decided.

15:12.901 --> 15:15.023
You didn't want electrical engineering anymore. 
You got into architecture. Yeah. I went down

15:16.625 --> 15:28.456
beforehand

15:16.625 --> 15:28.456
and talked to Mr. Langford.

15:28.476 --> 15:40.668
He okayed the transfer over into the architecture 
department.

15:40.688 --> 15:42.250
Now you graduated in 40... 46? No, 48. I got out in 
January of 49. 49, okay. And what did you do then?

15:51.988 --> 15:54.671
Before you got back in the green water. Well, I came 
to Dallas and went to work for a construction

15:54.691 --> 15:58.676
company.

16:02.541 --> 16:06.265
Starting out in the office as an estimator. Going 
over the plans and working as an estimator. And

16:10.270 --> 16:12.473
then we got a job

16:13.938 --> 16:18.522
in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. You mean as a contractor? 
As a contractor. And guess who he met there? Out on

16:25.789 --> 16:26.730
the town site. I was going to get to that. And so I 
went out there as the field engineer. It

16:33.275 --> 16:38.420
was a housing project. For the scientists and what 
have you? Some of it, it was completely on

16:44.296 --> 16:48.724
township. The government owned it all then. And 
the facilities were assigned. I don't know how

16:57.841 --> 17:03.992
they went about assigning who lived where, but we 
had about

17:06.470 --> 17:08.632
Well, we had two housing projects there. One of 
them was some little duplexes, which at the time

17:08.712 --> 17:16.580
were set up as colored housing.

17:19.744 --> 17:27.031
That was before the days of any integration, even 
in the government ranks. And then the others were

17:27.632 --> 17:35.380
apartment buildings and some row houses.

17:38.397 --> 17:44.122
In total, we were probably building 1,100 units or 
something like that. 1,100? So you were up there

17:46.164 --> 17:50.308
for quite a while.

17:50.328 --> 17:51.269
Well, I was up. Would have been there for quite a 
while, but actually I was up. Because you got

17:56.354 --> 18:00.097
snatched away. So well, yeah, if you left A&M in 
January of 49, You were a big 25 years of age, still a

18:07.760 --> 18:10.583
young man.

18:13.626 --> 18:15.428
You got a job as a contractor. Is the contractor 
still in business? No. He's dead now. Man,

18:20.573 --> 18:21.374
Laverne.

18:25.538 --> 18:26.539
Then you went to Tennessee. When did you meet 
Betty? In Tennessee. I mean, was that before you

18:29.622 --> 18:34.307
went to this Korea thing at Randolph or wherever? 
when we married just before I left our service.

18:41.789 --> 18:45.274
How'd you meet her?

18:45.294 --> 18:47.477
I didn't. It was a blind date.

18:52.264 --> 19:03.240
We knew each other approximately

18:52.264 --> 19:03.240
four months when we were

18:52.264 --> 19:03.240
married. It was really a blind date? And 46 years 
later,

19:05.759 --> 19:15.054
there we are.

19:15.074 --> 19:19.941
Oh, you're a lonely guy, out of town, right?

19:19.961 --> 19:23.967
And you got married just before you got yanked back 
into the service?

19:27.092 --> 19:32.661
Well, I got the call to come to report for duty. What 
was that, 1950?

19:37.531 --> 19:41.475
And y'all got married in Tennessee?

19:41.495 --> 19:43.297
In August and came to Texas. In August? In August. I 
thought I'd died and gone

19:46.581 --> 19:51.507
to hell. At Texas City. Texas City, oh, that's 
great.

19:57.734 --> 19:59.256
Well, you just missed the explosion. Texas City. 
Just after? Yeah, the town blew up in 48, 49,

20:01.655 --> 20:05.181
something like that. This was 50. Built back. No, I 
stationed at Ellington Field for a month.

20:15.838 --> 20:16.720
Refresher course. And then went from there to 
Randolph. So you got to accompany your husband.

20:24.833 --> 20:24.973
Mm-hmm.

20:28.227 --> 20:29.428
Randolph wasn't bad. No, Randolph wasn't bad. 
Ellington could have been nasty. It was that odor

20:34.775 --> 20:39.120
in Texas City and the mosquitoes. And a little gal 
from the hills of Tennessee had never experienced

20:40.041 --> 20:44.787
that before. Yeah, because they've got 
mosquitoes you can track on radar. Oh, Lord. Our

20:49.833 --> 20:51.295
walls were red.

20:54.138 --> 20:55.720
No air conditioning. That was the only place where 
we could find any place to stay. Military

21:00.363 --> 21:13.540
personnel that

21:00.363 --> 21:13.540
are going to be there for a month, it's hard to find 
an apartment. This

21:15.383 --> 21:24.795
one real estate agent called to Texas City and 
there was this one guy had got called up, recalled

21:25.231 --> 21:30.797
in the Marine Corps.

21:34.000 --> 21:37.785
And he had no objections to it. Military personnel 
using, it was actually a row house. A

21:43.591 --> 21:50.418
little one bedroom row house. And the shoes and 
everything in the closet, mildew. They're still

21:56.062 --> 21:57.283
flying at Arlington. They had a big air show down 
there just last weekend. Yeah, well, NASA uses it

22:00.847 --> 22:03.911
quite a bit, don't they? Yeah. No, they have 
several big air shows down there. It's not

22:07.554 --> 22:14.522
military anymore, but it's the Confederate Air 
Force does stuff there every year. I finally got to

22:14.542 --> 22:19.547
see the inside of the B-29, the one that's still 
flying. We were out. I don't know how much longer

22:21.323 --> 22:36.076
they're going to let that plane fly either. They 
got one in England at Duxford. They've got one up at

22:41.361 --> 22:44.564
Bright-Patterson, but it doesn't fly. They've 
got one, well, they got the Enola Gay at the

22:44.624 --> 22:51.330
Smithsonian. But you can't crawl around in there. 
No, but they let me in this one out here. Is that

22:56.629 --> 22:59.513
because of your husband? We got out there. They 
have quite a display of planes out there. Oh, yeah,

23:06.102 --> 23:08.064
I'm sure. A lot of it's Navy. The Navy's back in the 
facility out there. That was where the money came

23:14.072 --> 23:18.378
from.

23:20.601 --> 23:21.722
We went out there and It was just about an hour 
before closing time. They said, well, if you want

23:26.266 --> 23:32.893
to go through the museum, they said it takes you 
about at least two hours to go through it. You won't

23:33.054 --> 23:33.995
have time. I said, I don't want to see one plane.

23:39.601 --> 23:40.642
I want to see the B-29. And so we went out there, and 
there were three or four mechanics working on it.

23:51.554 --> 23:53.076
I told them what I wanted to do. They put a ladder up 
so that we could get in. I was going to say, because

23:59.064 --> 24:00.606
you have to swing up. Isn't there a little hatch you 
swing up? There's a hatch. And there are some rungs

24:03.630 --> 24:07.936
that we used to climb up on, but they put a ladder up. 
But the old man. And Daddy went on up in there. Was it

24:16.347 --> 24:18.650
the first time you were back in a B-29? Mm-hmm. Was 
it the way you remember it? Oh well they have gutted

24:21.511 --> 24:23.775
it primarily. Oh really? The gun turret has been 
taken out. A lot of the equipment has been...

24:31.328 --> 24:33.332
Updated? The navigation equipment is obsolete so 
it's all been taken out and

24:33.352 --> 24:43.330
this positioning system that they have now by 
satellite. The GPS thing. They have that mounted.

24:50.875 --> 24:59.608
The bombardier's section is out, and they have 
that mounted between the two pilots up where the

24:50.875 --> 24:59.608
bombardier would be sitting. Yeah, a lot of that's 
probably just extra weight. They stripped it of

25:04.174 --> 25:08.801
all unessential waste. That makes sense. 
Especially where they're flying it. And they say

25:11.803 --> 25:17.451
it still costs them about $5,000 an hour to fly that 
thing. Oh, I know. I know. Well, not only that,

25:19.294 --> 25:25.403
where do you get 120 octane avgas nowadays? They 
don't make this stuff. I don't know what they're

25:27.786 --> 25:30.430
flying that thing on. They're either putting in 
some sort of super additive, or they've detuned

25:30.450 --> 25:35.297
the engines. So they'll run it. I know a lot of guys 
who detune the engines. these old World War II

25:40.448 --> 25:41.810
planes? Because you can't get really super high 
octane aviation gas. It's a problem. Nobody makes

25:48.682 --> 25:49.203
it. Nobody uses it. The demand is for jet fuel. 
Yeah, that's right. That's exactly right. And

25:57.156 --> 26:03.927
see, all these little Cessnas and everything 
else, they're just riding around with low-led

25:57.156 --> 26:03.927
whatever or no-led. I mean, so it's... It's hard. 
It's kind of hard. I bet you the one in Smithsonian

26:12.082 --> 26:17.068
probably looks like what you remember. Well, now, 
I understood that all they had was just an old

26:17.088 --> 26:21.313
section. They didn't have the complete plane. Oh, 
you may be right. Now, they're trying to raise...

26:27.801 --> 26:35.650
There's one out in Arizona someplace that there's 
a group trying to raise money to get it back into

26:27.801 --> 26:35.650
flying condition. Is this the same outfit in that 
museum in Davis-Monthan? There's a museum in the

26:42.013 --> 26:49.823
desert in California that got started within the 
last 10 years, maybe. And they're in the desert on

26:50.945 --> 26:52.286
purpose. It's dry. Well, that's why they moved 
Confederate Air Force to Midland, was to get it out

26:53.247 --> 27:01.358
of that Harlingen humidity. The heat doesn't hurt 
anything, but the humidity's bad. And there's an

27:05.110 --> 27:08.775
Air Force flying museum. They got started in 
somewhere out in California, maybe near Muroc, I

27:09.577 --> 27:15.666
don't know. Somewhere out there. That may be the 
same bunch. See, if they're going to fly it,

27:19.952 --> 27:25.600
though, it seems to me they would take all the 
electronics out. Nobody needs old World War II

27:27.423 --> 27:29.626
radios. Nobody wants World War II navigation 
systems. No, the old radar unit, and it was a bulky

27:32.414 --> 27:35.479
thing. We had Loran, which was, I doubt if they even 
have a Loran transmitting station that will work

27:36.060 --> 27:50.703
off the frequencies that they were using back 
then. The Loran has been taken out. Well, that's

27:54.248 --> 27:56.692
all gotten real uptown in navigation. It's quite 
the deal.

28:03.380 --> 28:04.381
So you all got married when? 1950? August. That's 
right, you told me that, August.

28:11.992 --> 28:16.297
And then you had to enter the service again that 
same month? Mm-hmm. What's the mistake?

28:22.306 --> 28:22.786
We went to Biloxi first. What, you honeymoon to 
Biloxi?

28:28.338 --> 28:32.482
And there we had the roaches and the ants. We 
haven't had a breeze for years. I

28:36.205 --> 28:42.991
had to be true lover. I never would have made it.

28:47.515 --> 28:48.116
Well, I don't know. There's worse places in 
Biloxi. It's a short list. Where? But there are

28:54.262 --> 28:56.944
worse places. San Antonio was

28:58.156 --> 29:03.221
nice. We enjoyed living there. The only thing I 
didn't like was when I'd get on the bus to go

29:05.743 --> 29:11.128
downtown and everything, all I heard was Spanish. 
You know, I thought, they're all talking about me.

29:15.272 --> 29:19.977
You could have learned Spanish and discovered 
that they weren't. I know. But I learned to drive in

29:22.659 --> 29:24.501
San Antonio. That's why I'm such a good driver. You 
will. You will. That town is, street-wise, is one

29:28.063 --> 29:33.370
of the most disorganized towns I've ever been to. 
Sure. They tell me it's built on cow trails. No, no.

29:40.258 --> 29:41.580
Cows are much more organized than that. There's 
a...

29:41.620 --> 29:47.988
Well, you got out then in what, 52? 52. And you came 
back, you worked for the same contractor here in

29:50.211 --> 29:53.014
Dallas? For a while.

29:56.273 --> 29:59.697
What else did you build, just more buildings? Then

29:59.717 --> 30:15.257
three of us left

29:59.717 --> 30:15.257
there and set up our own company, which was kind of 
short-lived.

30:20.263 --> 30:25.470
You mean the partnership didn't work out, or the 
economy didn't support it, or what? Partnership

30:25.754 --> 30:31.221
just didn't work out.

30:31.241 --> 30:33.504
One of them was kind of addicted to the bottle. 
Makes it sound. I went then with another company,

30:37.389 --> 30:47.403
which I stayed with for 20 some odd years.

30:47.423 --> 30:48.344
Bought into it. Ended up as one of the major 
stockholders in the company. And we were very

30:55.910 --> 30:58.113
successful.

31:00.937 --> 31:01.738
It's still going.

31:04.763 --> 31:12.053
I sold out my interest when I retired.

31:12.073 --> 31:13.095
What kind of things did you build? With them, we 
built, we specialized in warehouses. Warehouses

31:20.125 --> 31:22.508
and light industrial buildings. These kind of big 
butler sort of buildings? Not butler, but more of

31:26.145 --> 31:31.833
the tilt-up wall or masonry walls.

31:34.456 --> 31:36.860
Beams and joist roofs. You did that in Texas or 
Southwest? I did it primarily in Dallas.

31:45.431 --> 31:51.499
We would go to Fort Worth, we went to Arlington, 
Mid-Cities areas.

31:54.905 --> 31:57.588
We built the building primarily for Trimal Crow.

32:00.331 --> 32:03.334
How do you spell it? C-R-O-W. Trimal Crow Company. 
I'm talking about trammels. T-R-A-M-M-E-L.

32:07.619 --> 32:12.143
T-R-A-M-M-E-L-L. O-E-L-L.

32:14.706 --> 32:20.212
Someone will ask when we're transcribing this,

32:14.706 --> 32:20.212
how do you spell it? He's one of them. Big 
developers in the world. He

32:24.940 --> 32:38.894
started spreading out all over the country and 
wanted us to grow too, but we didn't want to get

32:24.940 --> 32:38.894
that. We wanted something that we could,

32:39.715 --> 32:51.726
at the time there were just three of us, something 
that we could control, keep our, actual hands-on

32:52.583 --> 32:54.425
operation. We did

32:54.445 --> 33:04.578
most of the engineering

32:54.445 --> 33:04.578
on the buildings.

33:08.202 --> 33:12.848
We could take it from the ground up. Not only did the 
construction, but the engineering. Worked out

33:16.473 --> 33:21.459
very convenient.

33:21.499 --> 33:22.540
Did you use somebody else's Drawings, you have 
your own architect? Trammell Crowe had an

33:25.762 --> 33:27.504
architect. They would give us the layout, the 
general appearance, and we'd take it from there to

33:27.524 --> 33:37.314
get

33:27.524 --> 33:37.314
a completed building.

33:40.558 --> 33:41.078
And it worked. It was a very expeditious type of 
operations.

33:48.886 --> 33:50.788
We could give him a building. much shorter than 
normal development time, building time, where

33:51.983 --> 34:03.314
you'd go to an architect, get them to draw a plan to 
put out for bids and so forth.

34:03.334 --> 34:14.385
We cut that time considerably, which, when you're 
building on borrowed money and getting a tenant in

34:03.334 --> 34:14.385
and so forth is very desirable. Worked well for 
him, worked well for us.

34:20.792 --> 34:20.932
Yeah. Did you use your own? We

34:22.190 --> 34:30.783
used our own labor force and we had some subs that we 
used. We had an electrical subcontractor, we had

34:30.803 --> 34:41.881
an air conditioning subcontractor, we had a 
plumbing subcontractor.

34:41.901 --> 34:49.092
The air conditioning and the plumbing 
subcontractors each we set up in business.

34:51.788 --> 34:58.336
did primarily our work, the electrical 
contractor was somebody that we had worked with

34:51.788 --> 34:58.336
for years. We worked with those contractors all 
the way through. They were in the design and

35:03.622 --> 35:10.249
development stage as well as the construction 
part of it. They designed the air conditioning

35:10.269 --> 35:20.201
part, they designed the electrical work, did the 
electrical engineering.

35:20.221 --> 35:21.222
And you retired when? Okay,

35:21.708 --> 35:31.536
and you worked with this group for 26 years, you 
said? 23 years and some odd months. 23, that means.

35:35.760 --> 35:38.262
Well, what were you doing then in between? See, I'm 
missing some years here. You got out of the Air

35:42.606 --> 35:45.509
Force in 52. You went to work for a contractor. 
Stayed with him. 17 years, I don't remember. We

36:00.772 --> 36:01.933
just started a partnership. That was in 50...

36:08.761 --> 36:14.267
Both of them have always been burned when we met 
one, so that would have been about 57.

36:18.011 --> 36:20.554
So you worked with this other contractor for what, 
three, four years? about like that, maybe

36:22.238 --> 36:40.078
five. It must have been about five years before we 
actually split up, because it was 66 when I went

36:40.098 --> 36:50.389
with my friend, Ben Miller.

36:54.605 --> 36:56.808
So your partnership lasted what, three years? 
About three years. So about 1960 that dissolved?

37:05.139 --> 37:09.104
Well, it dissolved in 66. I went with this other 
company. We probably set it up in about 60. 59

37:13.991 --> 37:18.837
or 60. And then you went with this other outfit? 
that you worked with for 23 years in 66.

37:31.062 --> 37:33.284
Which is during big growth time in Dallas. It was.

37:37.068 --> 37:37.929
Through the 80s.

37:44.216 --> 37:46.518
We had more work than we wanted. We turned work 
down. We just couldn't do it. and gave some of them

37:53.127 --> 38:00.775
to other contractors.

38:01.516 --> 38:06.681
I guess the boys are still running it, I don't know.

38:06.701 --> 38:09.685
Haven't kept up with it since our retirement. Tell 
me a little bit about your

38:09.705 --> 38:20.316
thoughts, your relationship with A&M now. You 
were born in 24, this is 96, so you're 72,

38:21.882 --> 38:31.393
still young.

38:33.856 --> 38:36.959
I know you've been involved in this travel group, 
the Aggie. When did you get started

38:38.000 --> 38:42.866
doing that? 86 was our first trip. 86, we took our 
first trip, and then that was... a few years after

38:49.625 --> 38:52.948
that before we took another one. But you've been on 
several of those. But we've been on several of them

38:56.311 --> 38:58.554
now. Really enjoy traveling with them.

39:03.819 --> 39:16.611
Usually it's with there's

39:03.819 --> 39:16.611
someone on the trip that we know or have traveled 
with before

39:20.978 --> 39:28.608
something of that nature, and it's always nice to 
be traveling with a congenial group of people.

39:28.848 --> 39:29.129
Sure.

39:33.755 --> 39:36.258
Let me back up, maybe I asked the question wrong. 
What I guess I'd like to know is,

39:36.278 --> 39:47.273
well it may be obvious to you, it's not necessarily 
obvious to anyone else, why you would have an

39:49.177 --> 39:56.123
affinity for A&M besides the fact that you 
graduated?

39:56.143 --> 40:14.440
What I'm trying to get at is why or what were your 
motivations as you, after you graduated, to stay

39:56.143 --> 40:14.440
in touch with the school, to be involved with the 
school to the degree you have been? Have you always

40:14.460 --> 40:16.201
been involved that way? Is it something that's 
happened in the last I've

40:18.573 --> 40:33.787
been involved with the Farmer Students 
Association probably for the last 25 years or so.

40:37.771 --> 40:41.194
It was just an occasional trip down there before 
that.

40:46.739 --> 40:47.820
Our son Our oldest son went to school there and 
graduated. He's the one that we lost and who's on

40:55.285 --> 41:00.130
our way. We have this President's Endowment 
Scholarship plus then this student system

41:01.571 --> 41:17.048
endowment in his memory.

41:20.032 --> 41:21.514
It's more or less payback time.

41:26.699 --> 41:36.990
The training and so forth that I got there, the 
education, the training was what enabled me to be

41:26.699 --> 41:36.990
able to do something for them.

41:45.900 --> 41:47.642
In general, I like their

41:50.018 --> 42:11.125
attitude toward

41:50.018 --> 42:11.125
making education available

41:50.018 --> 42:11.125
at a reasonable cost to people.

42:11.145 --> 42:18.675
I don't think there's anybody

42:11.145 --> 42:18.675
that wants to go to get a college education now but 
with all the scholarships and assistance that is

42:19.904 --> 42:43.167
available

42:19.904 --> 42:43.167
at state universities such as A&M that couldn't 
get an education.

42:43.187 --> 42:48.072
I'm willing to help along those lines as best I can. 
Sounds good.

42:53.143 --> 42:56.671
Now a really tough question. What should I have 
asked you that I

42:56.691 --> 43:01.963
didn't? That isn't that question. Because I 
either didn't know to ask you or...

43:16.857 --> 43:23.166
You've covered just about every subject in this, 
but I can think of anything you can think to add to

43:16.857 --> 43:23.166
it.

43:40.232 --> 43:43.236
I'm just interested in the school.

43:48.093 --> 43:56.283
more from the

43:48.093 --> 43:56.283
academic part of it. Otherwise, I know that a lot of 
the graduates, there's nothing down there but a

43:58.766 --> 44:05.574
football team. I get really tired of that. And I 
have never given or supported the athletic

44:09.899 --> 44:17.408
department. I figure they get enough money to get 
into enough trouble without me contributing to

44:17.945 --> 44:25.313
it. But there are more beneficial ways that I can

44:25.333 --> 44:38.968
put what money I'm able to give to them to use.

44:44.555 --> 44:45.015
Thank you. Actually, I wish there were more guys 
like him, frankly. You're right. The athletic

44:50.458 --> 44:55.206
program, I think, is self-sustaining.

44:55.226 --> 45:02.018
In fact, it seems to be more than self-sustaining

44:55.226 --> 45:02.018
in many ways. But there are certain academic 
programs, and the library's only one of them.

45:10.313 --> 45:11.475
There are numerous academic programs that go big.

45:16.990 --> 45:22.237
I guess there isn't any reason for that. It's 
always refreshingly pleasant to find somebody

45:22.257 --> 45:29.948
who is interested. Three things that I have 
supported. That's the Alumni Association, the

45:32.452 --> 45:42.846
Corps, and then the library.

45:53.828 --> 45:59.617
So you can't think of anything I should have

45:53.828 --> 45:59.617
asked? I haven't had it in a long time. Well, I know 
there's somebody who doesn't have the wit to ask.

46:09.573 --> 46:20.030
Maybe what will happen when I get this transcribed 
and send it back to you, it might trigger some

46:09.573 --> 46:20.030
thoughts or ideas. Well, I don't know. We're

46:20.643 --> 46:27.532
not real exciting people. Well, like I said, I'm 
not necessarily looking for excitement either.

46:38.428 --> 46:45.838
That would be suspicious if all I heard were a 
series of exciting stories.

46:45.858 --> 46:48.381
I mean, you know what I'm saying? We're just... 
That's

46:49.482 --> 46:56.967
not the way real people live. Everyday citizens.
