WEBVTT

00:03.457 --> 00:14.688
Of course, that process had left me physically and 
intellectually tired. And so when I met this

00:17.191 --> 00:30.544
candidate, Dr. Dean Corrigan, C-O-R-R-I-G-A-N,

00:17.191 --> 00:30.544
then the Dean of Education at the University of 
Maryland,

00:33.815 --> 00:52.721
I was feeling that he had really better do a good job 
or that I might discount his capability

00:33.815 --> 00:52.721
quickly.

00:52.741 --> 00:56.346
By that point in my search committee experience,

00:59.549 --> 01:24.932
I tried to begin each interviewee's campus visit 
with a, quote, introductory session, quote, in

00:59.549 --> 01:24.932
which I, as the search committee chairman, would 
introduce the visitor

00:59.549 --> 01:24.932
at a session to which all members of the college 
faculty had been invited.

01:33.287 --> 01:42.039
They would have been provided with a brief resume 
of the newcomer.

01:46.124 --> 01:54.295
And I would then introduce the individual

01:46.124 --> 01:54.295
who would be asked to describe

01:54.595 --> 02:22.577
background of experience,

01:54.595 --> 02:22.577
and then discuss for the faculty

01:54.595 --> 02:22.577
what they thought were the major issues facing

01:54.595 --> 02:22.577
the general field in this case, of education.

02:29.735 --> 02:52.125
Also, we agreed in advance that the questions

02:29.735 --> 02:52.125
would not be informational

02:29.735 --> 02:52.125
quiz questions, but would be

02:29.735 --> 02:52.125
general in nature, trying to obtain a broader view 
of the speaker's attitudes and feelings.

03:04.217 --> 03:07.722
Paragraph.

03:07.742 --> 03:22.922
Within a few minutes after Dean Corrigan began his 
presentation,

03:07.742 --> 03:22.922
my mind and spirit was quickly awakened and alert. 
He seemed soon, he was the almost unanimous choice

03:25.265 --> 03:30.891
of everyone. And he came to A&M

03:32.012 --> 03:53.374
and fulfilled the expectations of so many people.

03:53.394 --> 03:53.854
Paragraph. Back in the early Calhoun and Williams 
days, one of the brief

03:55.927 --> 04:21.867
efforts which proved to be very productive was to 
select

03:55.927 --> 04:21.867
a few highly competent and young alumni who seemed 
to offer great promise for future success.

04:31.925 --> 04:52.123
These youngsters would serve as aides to the 
president, the vice president for academic

04:31.925 --> 04:52.123
affairs,

04:31.925 --> 04:52.123
and also work in Austin.

04:58.330 --> 05:26.143
The success of such an effort can be demonstrated

04:58.330 --> 05:26.143
when the identity of these men is

04:58.330 --> 05:26.143
mentioned as Kent Caperton,

04:58.330 --> 05:26.143
who had been president of the student body under 
Dr. Williams. and would later be an outstanding

05:27.642 --> 05:36.852
state senator and lawyer. He assisted Dr. 
Williams. Dave Mayfield, a product of

05:43.278 --> 05:57.413
architecture,

05:43.278 --> 05:57.413
who would go on to great success in his profession, 
served with those of us in academic affairs. And at

06:03.498 --> 06:29.020
this point, I cannot remember the young man from 
Hamilton, Texas,

06:03.498 --> 06:29.020
who

06:03.498 --> 06:29.020
was one of the key members of the A&M staff in 
Austin, serving as a sort of intern lobbyist,

06:03.498 --> 06:29.020
lobbyist in turn.

06:35.350 --> 06:58.804
The success of these three not only in what they did 
but what they became

06:35.350 --> 06:58.804
leads

06:35.350 --> 06:58.804
me now to wonder why didn't

06:35.350 --> 06:58.804
we continue that practice

06:35.350 --> 06:58.804
in future years

07:02.733 --> 07:24.876
because the cost, the financial cost was 
comparatively modest and the returns in future

07:02.733 --> 07:24.876
capability of the individuals and meaningful 
benefit to the institution was remarkably

07:02.733 --> 07:24.876
substantial.

07:37.985 --> 08:05.055
During those years, during the Williams years, 
the president's office was on the second floor at

07:37.985 --> 08:05.055
the south end of what we call the System Building, 
the magnificent white marble structure facing

07:37.985 --> 08:05.055
east toward Texas Avenue.

08:07.313 --> 08:36.426
As president

08:07.313 --> 08:36.426
of both the university, of both Texas A&M 
University

08:07.313 --> 08:36.426
and the A&M system,

08:07.313 --> 08:36.426
Earl Rudder and Jack Williams could and did make

08:07.313 --> 08:36.426
decisions without having to send them up to 
another level of bureaucratic delay, review, and

08:37.132 --> 08:44.161
delay.

08:49.848 --> 09:06.008
The bureaucracy

08:49.848 --> 09:06.008
in numbers, layers,

08:49.848 --> 09:06.008
and cost in time and personnel

09:09.312 --> 09:11.995
was quite modest. The effectiveness was even more 
impressive.

09:21.867 --> 09:35.303
Both Rudder and Williams were able to move the 
institution forward in every way there could be

09:21.867 --> 09:35.303
measurement.

09:37.831 --> 10:04.378
including enrollment,

09:37.831 --> 10:04.378
quality of student body, research volume in 
dollars,

09:37.831 --> 10:04.378
and significance,

09:37.831 --> 10:04.378
as well as national image

09:37.831 --> 10:04.378
and reputation.

10:10.315 --> 10:22.652
All of us were more and more proud to be a part of 
Texas A&M.

10:22.672 --> 10:23.153
Paragraph. As dean of faculties, one of my 
responsibilities was to attend coordinating

10:23.213 --> 10:33.388
board meetings

10:23.213 --> 10:33.388
in Austin. That agency was responsible for

10:40.876 --> 10:47.524
the coordination quote of all public higher 
education in the state. Thus, that group of

10:49.646 --> 11:09.870
gubernatorial appointees

10:49.646 --> 11:09.870
have the authority to

10:49.646 --> 11:09.870
authorize

10:49.646 --> 11:09.870
all academic areas of study, organizational 
pattern,

11:10.947 --> 11:28.052
and enrollment

11:10.947 --> 11:28.052
quality of each institution.

11:32.398 --> 11:39.148
Thus, it was they

11:32.398 --> 11:39.148
who could control

11:42.250 --> 11:55.588
the general direction

11:42.250 --> 11:55.588
of every public campus in Texas, even at the level 
superior to the regions.

12:03.779 --> 12:11.970
The opportunity for me to attend coordinating 
board meetings was very meaningful in terms of my

12:12.710 --> 12:23.539
understanding of higher education and future 
capability to relate to governing boards and

12:12.710 --> 12:23.539
state agencies.

12:28.684 --> 12:35.329
I believe that the Coordinating Board included 
perhaps 21 members, 18 to 21, something like that.

12:37.912 --> 12:41.755
A broad variety, geographic, in terms of 
geographic fake background,

12:42.173 --> 12:50.395
opinions, attitudes, et cetera.

13:18.303 --> 13:19.624
This is a note to the typist. At this point I'm in San 
Marcos and just realized that I missed a turn way

13:19.704 --> 13:26.771
back down the road and gone a bit out of my way. So 
we'll get back on the track though of the

13:28.473 --> 13:33.738
coordinating board.

13:39.504 --> 13:47.652
As the A&M administrator who attended all 
coordinating board meetings, I became the

13:48.745 --> 14:15.259
accompanist for all

13:48.745 --> 14:15.259
new A&M degree program requests and or 
organizational changes

13:48.745 --> 14:15.259
and gradually became well acquainted with the key

14:16.994 --> 14:24.803
coordinating board staff members.

14:36.796 --> 14:44.605
Particularly Ken, whose name I cannot think of, 
who would for a long time be the Commissioner of

14:45.192 --> 14:51.041
Higher Education for Texas.

14:57.211 --> 15:11.132
The most important of these

14:57.211 --> 15:11.132
program changes at A&M began one morning with a 
call from Jack Williams.

15:14.032 --> 15:39.128
Dr. Calhoun was out of town,

15:14.032 --> 15:39.128
and as I recall,

15:14.032 --> 15:39.128
I answered the phone

15:14.032 --> 15:39.128
and came to instant

15:14.032 --> 15:39.128
attitudinal attention when Dr. Williams

15:44.710 --> 15:48.334
Ask directed when Ernie and me. To come over to his 
office as soon as we could get there.

15:56.804 --> 15:58.266
We hurry across the street. Wondering what?

16:04.813 --> 16:06.776
The new task might be.

16:10.340 --> 16:11.041
And we're greeted. With a quick smile.

16:16.672 --> 16:24.523
and a truly challenging

16:16.672 --> 16:24.523
statement. Quote, I don't think you guys can do 
this,

16:24.543 --> 16:44.350
Dash, but I want here on my desk by this time next 
week all of the paperwork it will take

16:24.543 --> 16:44.350
for us to be able to request officially, through 
the Board of Regents,

16:45.443 --> 17:03.368
Coordinating Board, and the legislature, 
authority to offer degrees in medicine and law at

16:45.443 --> 17:03.368
Texas A&M.

17:16.578 --> 17:29.450
Quickly, as we returned, Dick and I quickly 
divided the task

17:16.578 --> 17:29.450
with medicine for him and law for me.

17:32.893 --> 17:46.365
And we worked

17:32.893 --> 17:46.365
tirelessly

17:32.893 --> 17:46.365
with the always determined and capable staff.

17:50.817 --> 18:12.548
and succeeded in

17:50.817 --> 18:12.548
reaching the

17:50.817 --> 18:12.548
assigned goal one day before the deadline which 
Dr. Williams had set.

18:17.956 --> 18:20.520
As the process began to evolve,

18:25.613 --> 18:54.034
all around the state, the other institutions that 
offered law and or medicine,

18:25.613 --> 18:54.034
whether public or private,

18:25.613 --> 18:54.034
began to speak out in loud opposition to any A&M 
effort in that direction.

19:05.658 --> 19:28.543
Nevertheless, we proceeded

19:05.658 --> 19:28.543
and the regents approved the request

19:05.658 --> 19:28.543
as we tried to go forward.

19:37.231 --> 20:06.867
In regard to law, the only ally we were able to 
identify was the great Houston lawyer, Leon, and I

19:37.231 --> 20:06.867
can't think of his last name,

19:37.231 --> 20:06.867
a graduate of Baylor who had a

19:37.231 --> 20:06.867
most admirable career including

20:07.302 --> 20:21.314
having served on the staff

20:07.302 --> 20:21.314
of the Nuremberg trials following World War II.

20:26.199 --> 20:35.807
Probably because of his influence,

20:26.199 --> 20:35.807
A&M was offered the South Texas College of Law. I 
understood that A&M was offered the South Texas

20:40.434 --> 21:06.013
College of Law

20:40.434 --> 21:06.013
with almost no strings attached except

20:40.434 --> 21:06.013
that it would never be able to offer any law courses 
outside Harris County.

21:12.101 --> 21:35.342
Dr. Williams declined that restriction because 
he wanted law and medicine as a part of the process

21:12.101 --> 21:35.342
to broaden A&M's

21:12.101 --> 21:35.342
academic view

21:12.101 --> 21:35.342
and influence.

21:39.642 --> 21:49.372
Meanwhile,

21:39.642 --> 21:49.372
I became a junior partner in Winerdi's effort on 
medicine.

21:52.515 --> 22:07.810
In that process, we happened to stumble onto a 
minor,

21:52.515 --> 22:07.810
what was possibly thought of as a minor addition

22:11.401 --> 22:19.994
to

22:11.401 --> 22:19.994
an act of the Texas legislature in 1943. That

22:20.054 --> 22:40.665
amendment

22:20.054 --> 22:40.665
gave legal authorization

22:20.054 --> 22:40.665
to a medical school, quote, Affiliated with the 
Scott and White Clinic in Temple, TX. Quote. If it

22:49.615 --> 22:50.996
was attached. To a public institution.

22:58.784 --> 22:59.825
After that discovery.

23:08.753 --> 23:08.833
Hey. Maroon and white.

23:14.783 --> 23:15.204
Lit. Caravan quickly headed to Scott and White.

23:31.784 --> 23:34.967
And received a warm. Reading.

23:44.078 --> 24:08.635
In addition, Dr. Williams hoped to make the A&M 
Medical Program a three-way partnership

23:44.078 --> 24:08.635
by including both Scott and Point in Temple and the 
Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. And the

24:10.578 --> 24:12.381
lawyer's name I was trying to think of a moment ago 
was Leon Jaworski, J-A-W-O-R-S-K-I.

24:24.890 --> 24:36.222
Dr. Williams Paragraph was well acquainted with 
the great heart surgeon, whose name escapes me

24:24.890 --> 24:36.222
right now, who then headed Baylor Medicine.

24:39.845 --> 24:41.507
And so for a number of months, we proceeded with 
that tripartite plan.

24:52.684 --> 25:05.857
Our application could not be stopped at the state 
level because legal authorization had already

24:52.684 --> 25:05.857
been given by the 1943 legislation. It did not 
include funding and the other medical groups in

25:14.478 --> 25:29.856
Texas joined in opposing an additional 
competitor for state

25:14.478 --> 25:29.856
dollars. Meanwhile, our application to the 
American Medical Association's accrediting

25:31.739 --> 25:38.747
group

25:41.663 --> 25:46.448
seemed to stall without any explanation.

25:51.052 --> 26:10.270
Then one day I happened to stumble onto the fact

25:51.052 --> 26:10.270
that that group was headed by an individual who had 
been

26:13.591 --> 26:24.444
terminated for some unknown reason

26:13.591 --> 26:24.444
by the Baylor administration a number of years 
earlier.

26:29.310 --> 26:41.185
That led the A&M planners to assume that we would 
not have any success with the American Medical

26:29.310 --> 26:41.185
Association's bureaucracy unless we terminated 
the Baylor link.

26:49.000 --> 27:00.616
Paragraph thus, with only Scott and White and A&M 
as partners, the plan was approved without delay.

27:03.921 --> 27:09.248
And we proceeded to dream of a medical school where 
the students would attend their first two years of

27:11.152 --> 27:39.893
study at college station and the two latter two 
clinical years in temple at the splendid scott and

27:11.152 --> 27:39.893
serve at the splendid scott and white hospital

27:11.152 --> 27:39.893
the emphasis in the A&M proposal was on

27:40.565 --> 27:56.501
broad service, family medicine, and community 
effort.

27:56.521 --> 28:08.293
The plan would be for every student to begin making 
rounds in Brazos County

27:56.521 --> 28:08.293
with medical practitioners the first day of the 
student's first year of medical school. Then in

28:16.024 --> 28:28.240
Temple, they would be in one of the most innovative

28:16.024 --> 28:28.240
medical, most innovative hospitals in the United 
States.

28:44.082 --> 28:45.203
Hold on, typist. I'm having to consult my roadmap 
here.

28:59.978 --> 29:10.208
One of the key moments in the search for funding

28:59.978 --> 29:10.208
came one day in College Station.

29:14.272 --> 29:40.414
when the,

29:14.272 --> 29:40.414
when Tiger Teague, when Olin Teague,

29:14.272 --> 29:40.414
the Tiger to his A&M classmates

29:14.272 --> 29:40.414
and countless others who knew him as a World War II 
hero,

29:43.904 --> 29:57.464
and a determined congressional leader joined the 
group.

29:59.266 --> 30:12.105
In some manner of discussion,

29:59.266 --> 30:12.105
he noted that he wished he could help A&M get some 
funding but that he didn't know anything he could

30:13.840 --> 30:18.705
do as a member of Congress. Yet he wished as 
chairman of the Veterans Affairs Committee that

30:21.068 --> 30:40.168
something could be done to get medical schools to 
help Veterans Administration hospitals that

30:21.068 --> 30:40.168
were because they were beginning to suffer. a 
shortage of medical practitioners.

30:47.689 --> 31:01.624
I quickly broke in

30:47.689 --> 31:01.624
by mentioning that there was a veteran's hospital 
across the street from Scott and White up in

30:47.689 --> 31:01.624
Temple. Quietly, Mr. Teague smiled, pulled out a 
note card from his pocket, and wrote something

31:11.384 --> 31:15.621
on that page.

31:19.959 --> 31:20.702
Perhaps
