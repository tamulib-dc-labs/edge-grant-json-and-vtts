00:06.207 --> 00:08.930
My first question concerns your academic 
background. What took you into oceanography?

00:11.033 --> 00:12.435
Interest, undergraduate training? Oh, I guess it 
was being a kid growing up on the waterfront, and

00:14.498 --> 00:23.970
then went off to college, and I found out they paid 
people to do this kind of stuff. I didn't believe

00:23.990 --> 00:25.732
it.

00:28.796 --> 00:33.582
Well, having been growing up on the waterfront and 
being in the commercial fisheries and I was just

00:34.709 --> 00:39.374
kind of interested in fishing and that sort of 
thing. Where did you grow up in Waterford? On North

00:40.775 --> 00:42.517
Shore of Long Island. Obviously you weren't from 
Seattle, I'm about to ask. And where did you do your

00:48.823 --> 00:51.045
undergraduate training? University of New York. 
And I ended up doing my graduate training there

00:54.248 --> 00:57.391
too. I did one year out here in 59-60 after I got my 
bachelor's degree. And I ended up going back for my

01:04.072 --> 01:08.498
master's and PhD at Cornell.

01:11.362 --> 01:14.666
Basically, it was more of a question of speed. I 
thought I had places to go and people to see and

01:15.047 --> 01:17.891
things to do. At that time, the graduate program 
here was extremely tedious. It was taking people

01:23.879 --> 01:28.084
seven or eight years to get out. You couldn't have 
made your notionography at Cornell. Well, they

01:30.700 --> 01:36.394
had an oceanographer there, but we were in the 
College of Agriculture in the Department of

01:30.700 --> 01:36.394
Conservation. And they had a guy there who was 
primarily teaching some service courses.

01:44.473 --> 01:48.844
But he did run a little program on Long Island. 
effluent waste problem on the south shore back

01:49.347 --> 01:58.395
when pollution wasn't even an in thing to do, but we 
were working on pollution back in the late 50s and

01:49.347 --> 01:58.395
early 60s. And this explains in your interest in 
ecology. This directs you towards ecology? Yeah,

02:02.979 --> 02:04.020
I believe so. Again, I guess I have to sort of lean 
back on what I did as a kid growing up and hunting and

02:06.002 --> 02:19.033
fishing and, you know, sort of interested in the 
outdoors and it was an area I never even thought of,

02:06.002 --> 02:19.033
you know, working at, you know, i.e. making a 
living. And then I, like I said, I went off to

02:22.817 --> 02:29.984
college and I found out they paid people to do this 
kind of stuff, but I just really couldn't believe

02:22.817 --> 02:29.984
it, you know. And, of course, that was a crazy time 
when right after Sputnik went up, and it sure felt

02:30.004 --> 02:42.456
nice to have people, you know, writing you letters 
and saying, please come here, you know, we'll do

02:30.004 --> 02:42.456
this and we'll do that for you. And so it was really 
kind of a, you know, the timing was right. I don't

02:46.553 --> 02:53.901
know what happened, you know, I would have gone 
through later on, but that's the way, you know, it

02:46.553 --> 02:53.901
was in the late 50s, early 60s. And you didn't take a 
break between your undergraduate training and

02:56.304 --> 02:59.888
your graduate training? No. You went straight 
through? I went straight through. Okay. And was

03:02.671 --> 03:04.854
the University of Washington your first job? No. 
After I got my degree at Cornell, I went to Scripps,

03:06.776 --> 03:14.805
and I worked in the TUNA group, a thing called 
Scripps TUNA Oceanographic Research Group. And I

03:16.388 --> 03:18.690
was there for about two and a half years. And I did my 
thing, which was phytoplankton ecology. After

03:24.817 --> 03:33.686
that, I went to Woods Hole for four years, doing 
basically the same thing, working with John

03:24.817 --> 03:33.686
Reiser and Dave Menzo and their group. And then I 
spent two and a half years at the National Science

03:35.187 --> 03:44.016
Foundation, leaving Woods Hole in January of 71.

03:44.468 --> 03:45.990
left the Science Foundation. I was a staff 
associate in the oceanography section in June 73,

03:46.010 --> 04:03.915
and I came out here in June 73 and been here ever 
since, still doing basically my phytoplankton

03:46.010 --> 04:03.915
type of approach to food web ecology. With whom did 
you work at Scripps now? The guy in charge of the

04:08.702 --> 04:13.108
group was Morris Blackburn. He was a transplanted 
Australian. And his old plankton type was Alan

04:16.276 --> 04:24.969
Longhurst, who went back to England as a director 
of a lab in Plymouth. And there was a

04:24.989 --> 04:28.334
phytoplankton, another phytoplankton type by 
the name of Bill Thomas. And there was four

04:29.436 --> 04:37.067
principal, what you would call principal 
investigators there, a group of maybe a total of 15

04:29.436 --> 04:37.067
people. And we were trying to hook up the game of 
phytoplankton, zooplankton into tuna with using

04:42.451 --> 04:48.843
physical parameters also. It was sort of the ego 
systems approach before they even coined the

04:49.204 --> 04:53.953
term. We didn't do any modeling per se. Again, that 
really didn't come into vogue until much later,

04:57.219 --> 05:05.775
although our statistical analysis at

05:11.712 --> 05:16.478
And then you, and you take this with you to Woods 
Hole, this technique with you to Woods Hole, and

05:11.712 --> 05:16.478
begin to work there. But you don't work on tuna at 
Woods Hole. No, no. At tuna we, uh, the, the rye of

05:19.222 --> 05:38.547
the group was basically, uh, looking at food chain 
dynamics, uh, using a chemical approach, uh,

05:19.222 --> 05:38.547
looking at, uh, mass balances and things like 
this, rather than being overly concerned with

05:19.222 --> 05:38.547
population dynamics, uh, the various species 
compositions of the various parts of the food

05:39.218 --> 05:44.165
chain. We used a bulk approach. We measured 
carbon, nitrogen, and things like that. Now,

05:48.671 --> 05:55.400
how did you make contact with the University of 
Washington from NSF? What prompted you to make a

05:55.740 --> 05:59.125
change for this? Well, it was sort of a question of 
did I want to get back to the science or did I want to

06:00.126 --> 06:08.517
stay in the administration? part and I thought I'd 
want to go back and do the science again and two and a

06:08.986 --> 06:32.479
half years is probably as long as you want to take 
off and what all I ended up doing was I let the word

06:08.986 --> 06:32.479
out I was looking for a job and this is the one of the 
ones that came in and one of the more attractive

06:08.986 --> 06:32.479
ones. Now, while you were at NSF, I have several 
questions, one of the things I wanted to ask you

06:32.797 --> 06:36.961
about. I have several questions, as a matter of 
fact, about grant giving and getting as it occurs

06:36.981 --> 06:42.106
on the level. It has been suggested that in terms of 
creating the discipline of oceanography, that

06:42.607 --> 06:50.995
grant getting directs the nature or the direction 
of oceanography. That is, oceanographers tend to

06:51.576 --> 07:01.706
petition the government for grants, not so much 
for their own research, but to do research like the

06:51.576 --> 07:01.706
NSF would like them to do. Is that your experience? 
Oh, there's a certain amount of truth to that. You

07:07.040 --> 07:15.789
obviously, when you're writing a proposal, 
you're obviously going to write one that you think

07:07.040 --> 07:15.789
is going to be funded, otherwise you're just 
spinning your wheels.

07:18.812 --> 07:22.916
There are certain in things, they're fads in 
science just like everything else.

07:25.839 --> 07:30.664
The nice thing about at least the Science 
Foundation was that there was a number of

07:25.839 --> 07:30.664
different offices you could go to if you had 
different kinds of problems in mind.

07:39.838 --> 07:42.561
The big programs, of course, are more directed. 
Not to say that that's necessarily bad. I mean,

07:44.944 --> 07:49.730
direction is like the NORPACS thing where they're 
trying to... The end result, obviously, is to try

07:49.750 --> 07:58.980
to predict weather so that when the IDOE office 
makes up their mind they're going to go

08:02.403 --> 08:04.626
the kinds of problems that they're willing to 
fund. But the oceanography section, per se, is a

08:05.107 --> 08:08.271
lot more open. And I think, by and large, it's 
probably as open as you're ever going to get. I

08:16.903 --> 08:24.854
believe the track record there shows that 
probably 10% of the funds each year are spent on

08:16.903 --> 08:24.854
flyers. Things that, you know, it's a good idea. 
I'm not really sure it's going to pay off. probably

08:32.474 --> 08:38.800
another 15 to 20% of the money is spent each year on 
young people coming into the business. Of course,

08:39.401 --> 08:42.484
that implies that they cut off the older guys, 
which they do. But I think, by and large, the

08:44.927 --> 09:01.283
Science Foundation, and to some extent ONR, is the 
only two places in the government where you can get

08:44.927 --> 09:01.283
money to do the kinds of things you're interested 
in doing, much more so than, say, IRDA or EPA or

08:44.927 --> 09:01.283
NOAA. what are more mission-oriented agencies. 
So I think you can still do more or less what you want

09:04.794 --> 09:08.999
to do. The thing at NSF, of course, is changing kind 
of rapidly. I got in sort of at the tag end where most

09:15.568 --> 09:22.396
of the programs were staffed by rotators like 
myself. You come out of academia, you plunk into

09:22.477 --> 09:29.025
the office for a couple years, and you knew you were 
going to go back out again. And so that you would

09:29.697 --> 09:33.821
drag along your ideas of what you thought was good 
science. But we've had so much trouble recruiting

09:34.921 --> 09:46.051
people to go to Washington, people just don't want 
to go, that we're ending up filling up all the

09:34.921 --> 09:46.051
program slots with career bureaucrats. And 
that's not exactly a desirable way to go.

09:55.059 --> 09:58.962
Well, with the reaction that we've had to the Nixon 
foolishness and everything else, and also the

09:59.347 --> 10:12.606
consumer advocacy emphasis and everything else, 
we're getting stuck with a lot of accountability

09:59.347 --> 10:12.606
jazz, which I think is really a detriment. Again, I 
look back at when I was there, we could walk through

10:14.909 --> 10:19.235
a grant in less than a day. If a guy, you know, his 
kids weren't going to have any shoes, he wasn't

10:19.275 --> 10:28.088
going to get any food, and we had to get that grant 
out that day, we could walk the thing through in one

10:19.275 --> 10:28.088
day. And there's no way that's going to happen 
anymore. It has to go through so many review

10:30.721 --> 10:32.543
boards.

10:36.348 --> 10:38.792
They just get to be more of a bother. And I imagine 
it's a heck of a lot less fun being back in the

10:39.072 --> 10:49.486
Science Foundation now than it was when I was back 
there, just because you're always on the firing

10:39.072 --> 10:49.486
line a lot more. We used to be fairly well protected 
from the bureaucrats and from Congress. But I

10:54.814 --> 10:56.556
think Congress gets down probably even to the 
division level now. Back in the old days, if I had to

10:59.500 --> 11:18.467
quote the old days, it's not that old, but if 
anybody from Congress tried to contact anybody in

10:59.500 --> 11:18.467
the Science Foundation, there was always a 
roadblock that they had to go to first, and they

10:59.500 --> 11:18.467
couldn't get by him to get to you. They had to tell 
him what they wanted, and he'd find a guy to answer,

11:18.847 --> 11:25.817
so that you never were in direct contact. The 
political punch is getting down a lot lower now

11:26.152 --> 11:29.857
than it was back then. And of course, we're running 
into all sorts of problems, again, with the

11:31.439 --> 11:42.392
foundation, which never existed and we never 
thought would exist just five years ago. And that

11:43.253 --> 11:45.997
has to do with the reporting aspects. And so

11:46.177 --> 11:55.669
back five, six, seven years ago, we did an awful lot 
of things on good faith, on goodwill. And that's

11:56.003 --> 11:57.025
gone. It's almost gone completely, which is 
unfortunate. Because the other agencies, of

12:02.213 --> 12:05.337
course, always had that kind of an aspect to them. 
So the Science Foundation was sort of the last

12:05.378 --> 12:13.049
stronghold of this thing. We didn't have to 
theoretically convince our superiors that

12:13.951 --> 12:19.199
science was good every year. But apparently, 
they're going to have to start doing that again.

12:25.180 --> 12:36.656
There's also a move in Washington now to combine 
all of ocean grant-giving units into one large

12:25.180 --> 12:36.656
super unit, probably the Department of Commerce. 
Do you approve of that? I think that would be

12:38.539 --> 12:39.720
disastrous. Basically, well, if it's strictly a 
grant-giving arm, I think that perhaps wouldn't

12:41.142 --> 12:51.677
be all that bad, mainly because it would be so darn 
big. that the guys in one office aren't going to be

12:51.978 --> 12:56.624
talking to the guys in the other office. So that you 
don't end up with a sort of monolithic uniform

12:58.527 --> 13:04.835
approach to the whole problem. I think even though 
it's inefficient to have these separate groups

13:04.995 --> 13:14.487
operating by themselves, I mean from an 
administrative point of view they're very

13:04.995 --> 13:14.487
inefficient. I think from a scientific point of 
view it's probably pretty darn good. But I think

13:19.314 --> 13:21.917
the real disaster would be if The major funding 
comes from the same organization that has its own

13:24.091 --> 13:29.959
in-house research capability. We see this across 
the street here at PMEL, which is a NOAA lab, an ERL

13:30.079 --> 13:37.610
lab. It's an environmental research lab. And they 
do their own in-house research. And

13:41.736 --> 13:46.603
theoretically, NOAA does extramural research 
also. But as soon as a squeeze comes along, you know

13:47.163 --> 13:50.148
who gets the pinch? We do. And of course, they keep 
their money. I mean, it's disruptive enough

13:53.808 --> 14:00.637
trying to keep your operation going from one year 
to the next now. But if you ever got into the

14:01.298 --> 14:11.992
situation where you're always being second and 
third guessed by somebody else, like these people

14:01.298 --> 14:11.992
over here are second guessed by people in Boulder, 
Colorado. And of course, their bosses sit back in

14:12.413 --> 14:14.716
Rockville, Maryland. And they really have very 
little control on their life. And I hate like heck

14:21.230 --> 14:26.177
to see us get, the academic area, get into the same 
situation. So I just

14:26.978 --> 14:38.374
think that something where they glommed 
everything together in one group would be kind of

14:26.978 --> 14:38.374
bad. The unfortunate thing is I think I see it 
coming. And there are a number of things that are

14:43.701 --> 14:47.727
probably going to swing it if it does happen. as 
we're having trouble with facility ships. How do

14:50.571 --> 14:52.234
you keep these things funded? How do you keep them 
going? And I have a feeling that in the name of

14:54.257 --> 15:00.926
efficiency, we might get crammed into some sort of 
a mold. I happen to be back at the foundation when

15:01.587 --> 15:11.301
the University National Oceanographic 
Laboratory System was being talked about as if

15:01.587 --> 15:11.301
they were going to do something.

15:15.989 --> 15:45.321
it was a wonderful scheme if you read the whole 
Stratton report and sort of an appendix on the back

15:15.989 --> 15:45.321
they said as a matter of efficiency let's say we do 
something about funding and operating ships and

15:15.989 --> 15:45.321
of course that's the only thing that survived 
everything else went out the window and so I could

15:15.989 --> 15:45.321
see the need for running facilities driving the 
whole thing and maybe something like that might

15:45.588 --> 15:48.010
happen. The other thing, of course, that could 
come out of it is that you'd end up with two or three

15:48.151 --> 15:56.219
centers in the country and cutting everybody else 
off. Again, this is

15:58.901 --> 16:05.248
sort of a problematical thing, whether something 
like this would happen. But that's always a real,

16:07.310 --> 16:10.032
live possibility. Well, now, actually, this is 
before your time, so to speak. There was a policy at

16:15.203 --> 16:21.870
one time, particularly when ONR was first 
organized, of sort of giving blanket grants to

16:15.203 --> 16:21.870
institutions. And then the institution was 
rather free to disperse the money among its

16:22.610 --> 16:29.277
various faculty members and researchers. Would 
you like to see a return to some sort of system like

16:29.657 --> 16:32.160
that?

16:35.263 --> 16:39.667
Well, that, of course, has, like everything else, 
good and bad points. That sure smacks of the old

16:39.727 --> 16:42.510
boys club, which

16:44.785 --> 17:09.611
the thing they level against the funding agencies 
now, I

16:44.785 --> 17:09.611
think for the institution itself, it probably is 
helpful to spread the blame, or as we called it back

16:44.785 --> 17:09.611
in Washington, I think it was share the 
responsibility, by letting somebody else in on

16:44.785 --> 17:09.611
the decision-making process so that they can't 
come and scalp you individually for making a bum

16:44.785 --> 17:09.611
decision. No, I'm not I'm particularly keen on 
seeing something like that.

17:19.425 --> 17:26.755
Personally, I almost prefer to go up every two 
years and get judged by somebody outside the

17:19.425 --> 17:26.755
institution. I think, as you probably figured 
out, or maybe you feel it yourself, that your own

17:27.156 --> 17:39.852
academic reputation frequently is a lot better 
outside of your institution than it is within the

17:27.156 --> 17:39.852
institution. again, my experience, again, 
having been at a number of these places, is that the

17:40.945 --> 17:55.679
internal politics is dependent to such, to a large 
and greater extent, on non-scientific things.

17:55.699 --> 17:57.360
You know, do you have the right car? There's a lot of 
social pressure involved in this thing. That's

18:04.107 --> 18:07.730
why I live 18 miles away from here, to keep out of it. 
And that's something I learned when I went to

18:07.750 --> 18:10.733
Scripps, the first thing I inadvertently 
happened to move about 10, 12 miles away from La

18:11.219 --> 18:17.088
Jolla, mainly because I couldn't afford anything 
closer. And that was the luckiest thing that ever

18:18.089 --> 18:20.032
happened to me. And ever since then, I've always 
done the same thing. Again, when I was at Woods

18:22.135 --> 18:25.400
Hill, I was 13 miles from the office. When I was in 
Washington, DC, I was 15 miles from the office. And

18:28.505 --> 18:35.935
that just seems to be enough to separate your own 
personal social life from the place you work at.

18:36.456 --> 18:40.382
And that's the way I prefer to fly. But again, 
getting back to your question, whether it's more

18:40.970 --> 18:53.804
worthwhile having money administered locally or 
not, I prefer to go out outside. I think I've gotten

18:54.045 --> 19:01.253
a better shake in what is getting on to be about 13 
years since I've been in the business. I think I get

19:01.453 --> 19:04.236
a better shake on a national level than I do 
internally.

19:07.079 --> 19:09.762
Also, I think it's fairly obvious that with funds 
are going to be cut, you know, for research. I think

19:13.428 --> 19:22.101
that's a given with a combination of inflation and 
falling prestige of academe because of the 1960s

19:13.428 --> 19:22.101
partially. You know, several things are involved 
in that, clearly. What about the oceans? Are they

19:26.687 --> 19:37.403
going to fall as sharply as others, or will 
oceanography be sort of the infield of the 70s, so

19:26.687 --> 19:37.403
to speak, with ecology and food supplies and these 
sorts of cliches now becoming common. Well, I

19:42.476 --> 19:48.346
think the ecology kick has never really done 
anything for us. We've never seen anything come

19:48.546 --> 19:50.069
out of that.

19:53.715 --> 20:00.345
I think oceanography will maintain its 
reasonable fair share of funding. I don't think

20:01.087 --> 20:04.993
we're going to suffer as drastically as other 
disciplines, chemistry for instance, really

20:05.851 --> 20:08.454
took it in the neck. High energy physics, you know, 
probably because they were so visible. Part of my

20:15.122 --> 20:21.370
job when I was back at the foundation was liaison 
for the all federally funded oceanography. And I

20:22.731 --> 20:27.657
started accumulating statistics on who was 
getting what and things like this. And I was always

20:28.092 --> 20:29.114
impressed. I always figured a small business 
administration should be administering

20:29.214 --> 20:33.601
oceanography. If you look at academic 
oceanography as opposed to governmental

20:33.761 --> 20:44.077
oceanography, where you can, at least I was in a 
position where I could get real numbers on it.

20:44.117 --> 20:45.860
We're talking $40 million a year. I mean, granted. 
reckoning in my checking account type

20:48.595 --> 20:55.705
arithmetic, that's a lot of money, but reckoning 
on the federal level, it's peanuts. That's

20:56.366 --> 20:59.150
rounding error.

21:00.832 --> 21:02.535
I mean, sure they could wipe us out completely. I 
don't think it does anything for the government to

21:03.576 --> 21:08.663
do this to us. Again, going back to a game we were 
playing at the foundation. And we had a write-up in

21:14.692 --> 21:18.597
the budget book every year, you know, why they 
should be supporting science. And again, the

21:19.818 --> 21:30.170
amount of money was so small that I thought that we 
ought to try to make a point that we're providing

21:19.818 --> 21:30.170
some pretty good entertainment on television. 
And rather than trying to cram it into the mold of

21:30.450 --> 21:41.603
how we're going to do something wonderful for the 
American people to make them materially better,

21:41.870 --> 21:44.213
you know, their standard of living or something 
like that. I thought we ought to try it on the

21:44.233 --> 21:46.816
entertainment aspect. And I got almost up to the 
front office with that before I got shot down. But

21:51.002 --> 21:59.292
it really is a rather minor enterprise in the 
United States on the academic scene. We happen to

22:01.034 --> 22:08.564
be, in this university, we happen to be a pretty 
large fraction of the grant and contract

22:01.034 --> 22:08.564
research. In the College of Arts and Sciences, 
have more bucks than all the other people in the

22:12.194 --> 22:17.182
College of Arts and Science put together. But 
there's only something like 18 institutions in

22:17.903 --> 22:30.944
the United States really doing oceanography, of 
which maybe five or six of them are major

22:17.903 --> 22:30.944
institutions. So again, it's kind of a small 
business. I don't think we'll get much from the

22:34.450 --> 22:38.877
food aspect. That was sort of one of the reasons I 
got into the business. In the early 60s, we were

22:42.271 --> 22:46.557
going to feed the world's millions from the ocean. 
And of course, the more I looked at it, the more

22:47.598 --> 22:52.985
obvious it was going to be that we weren't going to 
do this. But that doesn't mean we can't use what we

22:53.847 --> 22:58.573
have more efficiently.

23:01.236 --> 23:08.526
But the idea where we were just going to feed 
everybody from the ocean was really kind of silly,

23:01.236 --> 23:08.526
if you look at it. statistics it's only something 
like seven percent of all the protein in the world

23:09.215 --> 23:32.185
comes from from the oceans and we'd have to get you 
know a hundred times as much as we're getting out or

23:09.215 --> 23:32.185
really make a much of a dent you know as far as total 
population is concerned a number of times i was

23:09.215 --> 23:32.185
asked to make recommendations on on this sort of 
thing uh My feeling was that we'd be better off

23:34.223 --> 23:42.195
giving a guy a desalinization plant and a bag of 
fertilizer and a bag of seed and tell him to go out in

23:34.223 --> 23:42.195
the desert somewhere. And as far as increasing 
food production goes, that was a more direct

23:42.535 --> 23:53.351
approach to the whole problem, rather than some of 
the things we've done in the ocean. I think one of

23:54.032 --> 24:02.104
them, well, in the United States anyway, one of the 
biggest problems is food preference. Having

24:02.124 --> 24:03.927
worked in commercial fishing It was a part owner of 
a fishing boat at one time. We used to throw away

24:08.548 --> 24:11.774
more than we'd bring home because we couldn't 
market it. It wasn't worthwhile hauling it 20

24:11.794 --> 24:19.728
miles in, put it on the dock, because it would never 
pay for the fuel that it took to haul it. So we used to

24:19.788 --> 24:21.350
just throw it all back. So maybe in some respects, 
you know, maybe the Russians ought to come over

24:22.232 --> 24:27.501
here and catch the stuff, because they don't throw 
anything back. They make it into fish meal or

24:30.394 --> 24:32.857
something like that. They make a more efficient 
utilization of the resource that they catch, as

24:32.897 --> 24:39.225
opposed to the American fishing industry. I'm not 
quite sure whether the American fishing industry

24:40.346 --> 24:50.338
would stand still for making it more efficient. I 
mean, I think it's fairly clear that if we're going

24:50.939 --> 24:55.024
to get more protein from the ocean, we're just 
going to have to do it more effectively and not

24:56.168 --> 25:01.113
throw the stuff back. And when you start talking 
about capitalization to do this kind of thing, you

25:01.213 --> 25:12.543
don't find any large fraction of the U.S. populace 
with the dollars that's willing to do this.

25:15.626 --> 25:24.775
Maybe, you know, maybe you've got to go to some sort 
of subsidized sort of an operation where they

25:15.626 --> 25:24.775
build factory ships and you've got to increase the 
size of the vessels and American seamen don't want

25:26.122 --> 25:31.712
to go to sea for the times that it really takes to 
effectively fish. They can make almost as much

25:33.054 --> 25:35.078
money pumping gas. Why should they go to sea for 90 
or 180 days at a clip? I think, well, that gets into

25:40.988 --> 25:49.783
the whole merchant marine aspect too, but I was 
saying before I was down at this Polish fisheries

25:51.215 --> 25:58.925
research vessel here in town, and these guys are 
away from home for 200 days a year, the scientists

25:51.215 --> 25:58.925
included. When the ship leaves, it's got a full 
complement with it, and they might change the

26:00.226 --> 26:13.382
whole complement 200 days down the line or 250 days 
down the line, and then the guys get three months

26:00.226 --> 26:13.382
off or something like this. But you don't find very 
many Americans doing that sort of a game. I think we

26:20.999 --> 26:22.340
sort of wandered off. No, we're still fine. 
Whatever the question was. Well, my next

26:24.923 --> 26:27.124
question, you partially answered it. Are you very 
optimistic, given your line of work, about

26:27.265 --> 26:31.629
mariculture and aquaculture?

26:35.592 --> 26:46.622
Well, the problem with aquaculture is that it's 
primarily a labor-intensive type of a thing. And

26:47.583 --> 26:48.964
given the standard of living, that we have in this 
country. We have problems getting people

26:50.950 --> 26:56.598
to do that kind of work. The reason the Japanese can 
do it, and I don't know how much longer they'll be

26:58.080 --> 27:13.041
able to do it, is that their standard of living is 
increasing rapidly and they might price

26:58.080 --> 27:13.041
themselves out of the market too.

27:14.142 --> 27:17.567
The only thing I can see coming out of aquaculture 
is luxury food items. I don't see it coming, you

27:20.585 --> 27:26.710
know, a mainstay for protein supplements or 
anything like that. But we have a number of

27:27.511 --> 27:34.357
operations in this country here that are almost 
breaking even, or some of them are even making

27:27.511 --> 27:34.357
money. And there was one operation on Long Island 
that was making money, but that's because they

27:35.278 --> 27:47.689
were running ads in the New Yorker magazine and 
they were selling their clams or oysters, I forget

27:35.278 --> 27:47.689
what they were growing, as some sort of 
ecologically desirable way of doing it. So, I

27:53.492 --> 27:59.468
mean, they were selling their products to sort of 
an elite group of people who were, you know, I guess

28:00.123 --> 28:13.710
they were environmentally aware or something 
like this, and it made them feel good to be able to

28:00.123 --> 28:13.710
eat these clams that came from this plant that was 
doing the right sort of thing according to their

28:00.123 --> 28:13.710
way of thinking. But I'm sure they were paying two 
times as much, two to three times as much for their

28:13.730 --> 28:22.047
clams if they went down to a local fishing store or a 
fishing market and buy it. I think the same is true

28:24.473 --> 28:33.205
for, well, if you look at what they're trying to 
produce in agriculture in the United States, it's

28:24.473 --> 28:33.205
salmon, trout, oysters, lobsters. And if you've 
been to a grocery store lately, these aren't your

28:34.587 --> 28:41.276
protein backstays. The price of them is such that 
you can't afford to supplement your diet. It's not

28:48.567 --> 28:49.428
a supplement. You have to supplement your diet 
with soybeans if you buy lobsters. And I like

28:54.022 --> 28:59.128
lobsters too, but at the price lobsters are going, 
I'd buy some red meat. No,

28:59.168 --> 29:18.772
I don't think aquaculture is, well, I think 
aquaculture is a viable business as a commercial

28:59.168 --> 29:18.772
enterprise, but I don't see it as being a 
tremendous boon to take protein from the marine

28:59.168 --> 29:18.772
area. Of course, the other real problem that they 
run into is that they're in, They're always in the

29:23.536 --> 29:29.482
coastal zones, which are the first ones that get 
the pollution impacts. And so you have, like,

29:30.523 --> 29:35.328
Catch 23 or whatever number you want to take. John 
Ryder has been growing

29:35.348 --> 29:41.295
oysters. I can see he's grown clams, sandworms, 
and kelp in some sort of a system he has at Woods

29:41.315 --> 29:49.984
Hole, utilizing human sewage. And it's a very 
efficient system. system when you get to the

29:51.515 --> 30:20.745
outfall of the system you got clean water that's 
because everything was kept by the guys on the

29:51.515 --> 30:20.745
inside but EPA says you can't use that for human 
consumption so you know what you're sort of stuck

29:51.515 --> 30:20.745
you know here we've got a combination organic 
matter production area sewage cleanup area all at

29:51.515 --> 30:20.745
once but then what do you do with the biological 
material you have between the input pipe in the

30:20.978 --> 30:22.544
outfall. I guess you can load it on a barge and take 
it out to sea and dump it, but that doesn't do you

30:24.009 --> 30:29.448
much. That seems to be one of the problems.
