00:04.430 --> 00:05.891
That doesn't sound too impressive. Maybe it's 
going, okay? But the way we took them off to raise

00:08.470 --> 00:12.010
families and things, but there were teachers. I

00:14.290 --> 01:07.690
always told them no sleeping

00:14.290 --> 01:07.690
at

00:14.290 --> 01:07.690
the desk. I

01:08.230 --> 01:35.100
was running away from us, and we didn't have 
classrooms large enough to accommodate

01:08.230 --> 01:35.100
students. And I had a lecture in the physics 
building at 1 o'clock in the afternoon. That's,

01:40.110 --> 01:42.670
you know, that's hell for anybody to stay awake. 
It's

01:42.650 --> 01:55.700
a two-meter

01:42.650 --> 01:55.700
stick on the chalkboard. So I kept lecturing

01:55.840 --> 02:03.290
through the classroom. And then

02:03.270 --> 02:58.080
I would

02:03.270 --> 02:58.080
explain to somebody in class, and if they were 
sleeping through it, they were wasting all this

02:58.140 --> 03:00.760
money. I

03:01.480 --> 03:11.150
wanted to ask a question about what I said or can't 
say. That's okay. But I'm

03:12.772 --> 03:35.960
bothered when I started, but I've always told them 
I have a hairstyle.

04:18.400 --> 04:19.981
I'm saying 20%. And

04:19.960 --> 04:37.800
I've done, oh, I've done a lot of different things 
for the last several years. I've

04:41.220 --> 04:58.440
done situations where I would drop the low lecture 
exam out of those four and just count the top three.

05:00.540 --> 05:01.621
I don't do that anymore.

14:13.840 --> 14:17.500
I was in the JCs when we were at Cornell. Actually, 
it was JC of the year one year. So I had an interest in

14:23.000 --> 14:27.360
civic clubs and activities. I've probably done a 
lot more through the church than he has. Then here

14:33.650 --> 14:38.610
on the campus, describe your perception of the 
leadership when you arrived those first years at

14:38.590 --> 14:45.840
the college level and the campus level. Dean 
Kunkel was dean. Describe him as you perceived him

14:48.920 --> 14:52.040
in those early years. Well, Dr. Kunkel was 
probably one of the deepest thinkers, or he is, one

14:58.800 --> 15:00.101
of the deepest thinkers. He had a head in 
agriculture and quite a philosopher in his own

15:00.880 --> 15:04.520
right. Administratively, probably not very 
strong. He's

15:10.720 --> 16:37.230
been very important.

28:04.750 --> 29:38.080
Usually,

28:04.750 --> 29:38.080
there have been a number of other situations where 
students get, you know, one committee member

29:38.680 --> 29:40.600
tells them one thing, another committee member 
tells them something else. And sometimes,

29:43.300 --> 30:03.040
things like that. What are some of them? Any 
student, or are there any phony? You mean in class,

30:14.050 --> 30:16.770
or just in graduate students? These graduate 
students. No, you know, I don't remember any

30:18.570 --> 30:31.140
situation of

30:18.570 --> 30:31.140
that kind of thing. I might have been too dumb to see 
it. But again, I think it reflects the

30:34.060 --> 31:17.620
kind of...

31:17.600 --> 31:19.600
There was never any... I think they had a few 
arguments and things, but it's probably good.

31:22.640 --> 31:24.660
What about some of... The undergraduate, good old 
boy stories. There must be some good anecdotes you

31:30.600 --> 31:33.660
recall, excuses or...
