00:06.612 --> 00:07.695
Maybe it's going, OK? But the women took them off to 
raise families and things. But they were

00:12.129 --> 00:14.597
teachers.

00:40.092 --> 01:07.839
I

00:40.092 --> 01:07.839
always told them

00:40.092 --> 01:07.839
no

00:40.092 --> 01:07.839
sleeping. Yes.

01:30.818 --> 01:36.584
run away from us and we didn't have classrooms 
large enough to accommodate students. And I had a

01:36.604 --> 01:39.848
lecture in the physics building at 1 o'clock in the 
afternoon. That's, you know, that's hell for

01:40.148 --> 01:42.691
anybody to stay awake. I'd have in the center of the 
classroom just went sound asleep and there was a

01:44.853 --> 01:54.463
two meter stick on the Chalkboard, so I can't let.

02:01.080 --> 02:07.450
Walk out through the classroom just watching it.

02:09.133 --> 02:12.638
Oh, I thought.

02:52.628 --> 03:01.078
over that, and then I've explained to somebody in 
class, and if they were sleeping through it, they

02:52.628 --> 03:01.078
were wasting all this money. Right.

03:06.884 --> 03:08.806
But they're always talking to each other. I mean, 
to ask a question about what I said or can't say,

03:08.826 --> 03:20.980
that's okay, but it's bothering the people around 
you.

03:21.000 --> 03:21.100
Nick?

03:33.044 --> 03:50.580
when i started but i've always told them i have a 
hairstyle

04:18.320 --> 04:43.028
And

04:18.320 --> 04:43.028
I've done over the years, I've done a lot of 
different things for the last several years.

04:49.555 --> 04:51.600
There's no doubt about it. I've done situations 
where I would drop the low lecture exam out of those

04:53.204 --> 05:00.703
four and just count the top three. I don't do that 
anymore.

14:13.585 --> 14:17.629
I was in the JC's when we were at Cornell. Actually, 
it was JC of the year one year. So I've had an

14:23.235 --> 14:29.881
interest in civic clubs and activities.

14:30.362 --> 14:33.705
Probably done a lot more through the church than 
any other. Then here on the campus, describe your

14:33.725 --> 14:43.255
perception of the leadership when you arrived 
those first years at the college level and the

14:44.416 --> 14:45.838
campus level. Dean Kunkel was dean. Describe him 
as you perceived him in those early years. Well,

14:54.630 --> 15:04.504
Dr. Kunkel was probably one of the deepest 
thinkers, or he is one of the deepest thinkers that

14:54.630 --> 15:04.504
we've had in agriculture and quite a philosopher 
in his own right. Administratively,

15:05.325 --> 15:10.913
probably not very strong,

16:34.897 --> 16:37.228
may have been very important.

20:23.755 --> 20:26.492
Amen.

28:04.780 --> 28:05.409
Usually...

28:40.538 --> 28:40.782
um,

29:19.300 --> 29:46.354
there

29:19.300 --> 29:46.354
have been a number of other situations where 
students uh get you know one committee member

29:19.300 --> 29:46.354
tells them one thing another committee member 
tells them something else and sometimes

30:00.982 --> 30:03.745
Things like that. What are some of the... Any 
student trying to pull over? Are there any

30:11.512 --> 30:16.758
phony... You mean in class or just in graduate 
school? These graduate students.

30:20.962 --> 30:26.247
No, you know, I don't remember any situation of...

30:30.007 --> 30:31.212
of that kind of thing. I might have been too dumb to 
see it. But again, I think it reflects the kind of

30:34.083 --> 30:38.481
the

31:16.463 --> 31:17.405
Well, yeah. There was never any... I think they had 
a few arguments and things, but it's probably

31:19.769 --> 31:22.735
good. What about some of the undergraduate good 
old boy stories? There must be some good anecdotes

31:30.971 --> 31:34.017
you recall or excuses or...
