00:07.152 --> 00:14.614
But the women took them off to raise families and things, but they were teachers.

00:40.058 --> 00:54.681
I've always told them no sleeping.

00:54.701 --> 00:55.563
I've always told them no sleeping.

00:55.583 --> 01:07.922
I've always told them no sleeping.

01:30.802 --> 01:54.582
was running away from us and we didn't have classrooms large enough to accommodate students and i had a lecture in the physics building at one o'clock in the afternoon that's you know that's hell for anybody to stay away just one old boy right out in the center of the classroom he just went sound asleep and there was a two meter stick on the

01:55.000 --> 02:03.396
So I kept lecturing and I took this two-meter stick and walked out through the classroom.

02:03.597 --> 02:07.324
Of course, I always took it to Washington.

02:07.344 --> 02:10.410
And I got that two-meter stick down on my four-step.

02:52.612 --> 03:02.222
over that and then I've explained to somebody in class and if they were sleeping through it, they would waste a lot of money.

03:06.807 --> 03:07.368
Right.

03:07.388 --> 03:08.770
They're always talking to each other.

03:08.790 --> 03:21.083
I mean, to ask a question about what I said or can't say, that's okay, but let's bother the people around.

03:32.993 --> 03:38.502
when I started, but I've always told them I have a hairstyle.

03:50.443 --> 03:50.563
Sorry.

04:18.320 --> 04:40.010
And I've done, oh, over the years, I've done a lot of different things.

04:40.110 --> 04:42.994
For the last several years, I've done bonus points again.

04:49.572 --> 04:53.684
There's no doubt about it.

04:54.346 --> 05:00.103
I've done situations where I would drop the low lecture exam out of those four and just count the top three.

05:00.705 --> 05:01.708
I don't do that anymore.

14:13.552 --> 14:17.616
I was in the JC's when we were at Cornell.

14:18.537 --> 14:21.761
Actually, it was JC of the year one year.

14:23.202 --> 14:29.870
So I had an interest in civic clubs and activities.

14:30.350 --> 14:32.593
Probably done a lot more through the church than any other.

14:33.714 --> 14:43.204
Then here on the campus, describe your perception of the leadership when you arrived those first years at the college level

14:44.348 --> 14:45.810
and the campus level.

14:46.771 --> 14:48.293
Dean Kunkel was Dean.

14:49.014 --> 14:51.977
Describe him as you perceived him in those early years.

14:54.620 --> 15:04.492
Well, Dr. Kunkel was probably one of the deepest thinkers, or he is one of the deepest thinkers that we've had in agriculture and quite a philosopher in his own right.

15:05.293 --> 15:10.980
Administratively, probably not very strong.

16:34.880 --> 16:37.195
It may have been very important.

20:25.223 --> 20:26.173
Bye.

28:04.763 --> 28:05.392
Use it.

28:40.420 --> 28:40.781
from,

29:19.267 --> 29:40.601
There have been a number of other situations where students get, you know, one committee member tells them one thing.

29:40.681 --> 29:42.524
Another committee member tells them something else.

29:43.365 --> 29:44.447
And sometimes sometimes.

30:00.948 --> 30:03.412
Things like that.

30:04.353 --> 30:07.738
What are some of them?

30:07.759 --> 30:10.182
Any student travel over?

30:11.504 --> 30:12.486
Are there any phony?

30:14.489 --> 30:16.732
You mean in class or just in graduate students?

30:16.752 --> 30:18.255
These graduate students.

30:20.959 --> 30:26.247
No, you know, I don't remember any situation of...

30:29.973 --> 30:31.116
of that kind of thing.

30:31.196 --> 30:32.701
I might have been too dumb to see it.

30:34.064 --> 30:39.780
But again, I think it reflects the kind of the atmosphere that we've been

31:15.012 --> 31:23.807
Well, yeah, there was never any, I think they had a few arguments and things, but it's probably good for both of them.

31:23.827 --> 31:30.037
What about some of the undergraduate good old boy stories?

31:30.939 --> 31:34.084
There must be some good anecdotes you recall, excuses or...
