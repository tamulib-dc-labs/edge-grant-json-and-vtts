WEBVTT

00:04.992 --> 00:05.813
much to our liking. Of course, it was just Joe and me 
by this time, the kids who moved on from them in

00:06.554 --> 00:12.500
Tennessee. Okay? And, uh, uh, Roy, uh, they were 
wanting help with Ray's absence for all those

00:14.322 --> 00:23.893
months. Yeah. Because they had to wait for me to 
come. They were very patient about that. I

00:28.178 --> 00:33.784
couldn't shake loose from Tennessee until March, 
and I guess Ray had died by the fall. And so we had a

00:34.237 --> 00:40.005
lot to do and a lot of catching up to do. And they had, 
the staff had done really well, I thought when we

00:40.025 --> 00:52.943
got here, about filling the gap, you know. So they 
held a meeting to play a little catch up for it. And

00:59.052 --> 01:03.078
they said it'd take two years to catch up. I didn't 
think so. and

01:04.915 --> 01:15.545
it didn't take that long to get to West New York. Not 
to waver like

01:15.746 --> 01:31.221
the old me, but it's just the way I saw things going 
together with the suppliers, and that was a key

01:15.746 --> 01:31.221
factor in getting things done or caught up. Had I 
had to use strange suppliers, it probably would

01:31.241 --> 01:32.923
have taken a couple of days. But I was allowed to... 
I looked at the situation,

01:34.565 --> 01:42.035
and I was not hampered by anything like that. Okay, 
tell me now, in terms of book publishing in the

01:42.055 --> 01:47.583
University of Florida, what was your role? How do 
you fit into that, into the process of book

01:47.663 --> 01:51.308
publishing? Where? Okay. As though you were 
writing for the uninformed, and I am uninformed,

01:52.729 --> 01:58.217
too, so. Given the scenario of a manuscript in its 
natural flow to a publishing house, it would

02:05.176 --> 02:21.397
normally go through the appraisal process, or 
acquisition process, and the appraisal process,

02:05.176 --> 02:21.397
and then acceptance, and the polishing, and then 
into editorial, finally, and once that's

02:05.176 --> 02:21.397
accomplished, into design. Okay. Okay. And, when 
you design a book, especially for Universal

02:24.721 --> 02:33.152
Effects, what are you looking for, what are you 
trying to do with a book? First thing. is becoming.

02:43.266 --> 02:46.430
In my career, it always has been. Not to say that 
that's the first thing that needs to be dealt with.

02:51.236 --> 03:00.989
It's the scholarship that is vital to the 
publication of any scholarly book. But it's not

03:01.009 --> 03:03.532
always dealt with that way. Sometimes it's a 
political decision. to satisfy other pressures

03:06.500 --> 03:10.315
on administrative types. Sometimes it's, well, 
any number of reasons. But any press that's

03:16.507 --> 03:27.184
protected in politics is going to be a freer, more 
honest press. How did this one fit in? This one

03:29.708 --> 03:30.710
here? I think if you go back and read that thing that 
Frank did in his statement about the press when it

03:30.730 --> 03:40.947
began. Type 22, I think. uh yeah and then he did that 
at the beginning thing i've got that yeah and you

03:42.106 --> 03:51.829
know in there i believe he said something about 
Yes. Well,

03:54.552 --> 04:12.795
yes.

04:16.100 --> 04:18.002
Yes. Because the deal he worked, as I understood 
it, was on that basis, and Jack Williams, as I got

04:18.387 --> 04:31.361
out, was very much in tune with that. Now, was it 
still that way you think when you got here? Did you

04:35.066 --> 04:36.247
sense much? I didn't sense much external 
pressure. There was a little flash every now and

04:42.130 --> 04:44.773
then, but Lloyd didn't know that. And that wasn't 
common stuff. That's just vibes we'd feel, you

04:46.796 --> 04:52.383
know, down the hall. And so, no, I think that I was, I 
was good at about as free a hand as doing what I do,

04:52.403 --> 05:04.819
did, as anybody. But I'd have to say that I was given 
that early at Oklahoma. I was allowed that

05:15.579 --> 05:18.803
privilege right on through. I guess I didn't 
disappoint too many people or raise too many

05:18.963 --> 05:23.407
animals. Again, when you're doing a university 
principal, you've got to think of economy, cost.

05:27.632 --> 05:32.476
What else are you thinking about? Well, assuming 
the proper organization has been done within the

05:32.496 --> 05:37.922
text, then It's up to the designer to take that 
apart or analyze what's there and apply it in a

05:38.290 --> 05:53.027
typographic kind of way that will hold through. 
But if, for example, you're going to be doing a

05:53.047 --> 06:02.357
series of books

05:53.047 --> 06:02.357
based on a preliminary design or a design used on a 
first product, then it has to be... Fit the series,

06:04.497 --> 06:05.479
okay. Yeah, it's got to fit the series, and it's got 
to be flexible in the concept that will allow

06:05.499 --> 06:12.271
variations that may or may not come. Okay. So 
you've got to think way on that front. Now, when you

06:15.998 --> 06:26.657
got into A&M Publishing, did you feel that the 
series were sort of pre-prescribing your design

06:15.998 --> 06:26.657
work substantially? Well, naturally. It 
provides limits. And if you know what the current

06:32.130 --> 06:41.198
limits are, then you don't have much of a problem. 
You can see what your contemporaries are doing.

06:43.320 --> 06:48.224
And then you would depart or stay with them.

06:50.326 --> 06:56.712
But again, economics

06:50.326 --> 06:56.712
are always a factor. I don't lie, but cost

06:57.670 --> 07:02.477
overrides. And I always

07:02.497 --> 07:18.161
view

07:02.497 --> 07:18.161
my accuracy or my evaluations as good or bad based 
on how closely I come to that. If I can get under the

07:18.181 --> 07:24.691
forecast budget, I do

07:18.181 --> 07:24.691
it. I don't lie to you. you get caught. And so your 
best protection

07:28.982 --> 07:54.289
is to have a job with analysis and manuscript and 
marketing and what you can do with the other books

07:28.982 --> 07:54.289
that are in the line, how much creative time you can 
factor in as the other books are moving along,

07:28.982 --> 07:54.289
which is an item that gets lost in the heat of an 
energetic acquisition and can damage your

07:54.843 --> 08:09.244
performance in the marketplace if you don't look 
at the goods as promised. So you have to be, some

08:09.344 --> 08:24.647
people just want to drop the project as soon as 
their part's through and speed on to the next thing

08:09.344 --> 08:24.647
and others are left with the details all through 
it. Now, was your job also basically to make the

08:24.948 --> 08:34.378
printing contract arrangements and submit the 
book for years or send it where it had to go? Yes. Did

08:35.719 --> 08:39.243
you use bid processes or did you just go well? 
Right. State regulations required bids within

08:42.026 --> 08:49.954
the framework defined by state purchasing. And 
this was true at Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Texas.

08:54.428 --> 08:57.693
So you really managed production? That's right. 
Period. Right. Okay.

09:03.261 --> 09:04.723
Without interference. Occasionally, well, more 
than occasionally, we always had input from other

09:05.003 --> 09:12.674
departments. But we didn't always take it for 
reasons of our own. We weren't bound to get caught.

09:21.327 --> 09:26.873
and finally squabbles over how to do them once the 
manuscript was turned over. Now, when you came,

09:26.893 --> 09:35.323
were there weekly meetings on something on an 
organized basis or a regular, erratic basis, or

09:26.893 --> 09:35.323
how did y'all work together? It wasn't 
particularly structured. I'd say on an as-needed

09:38.587 --> 09:42.131
basis with Lloyd. He responded to that. I think I 
always felt that he had confidence and the people

09:51.500 --> 10:14.790
that with one thing north said for example not in 
the ward law one law had weekly meetings but those

09:51.500 --> 10:14.790
meetings were instructed and he told you he gave 
you information but he did not solicit

09:51.500 --> 10:14.790
information yeah you got your marching on which i 
thought was interesting that is interesting yeah

10:15.007 --> 10:18.470
He had the rules. And what you had to do was learn 
them. Then he expected you to work within the

10:26.518 --> 10:30.802
rules. And if you didn't, then you got your hands 
slapped. I mean it wasn't his business of meeting

10:35.787 --> 10:42.373
regularly and dictating things or making all the 
decisions. He had enough confidence to And that

10:44.791 --> 10:47.135
was a major difference. And when Noah said that 
Warbaugh did not delegate, everybody felt good

10:47.235 --> 10:58.512
about it, but I think because Warbaugh had 
legendary diplomatic qualities about him or

10:47.235 --> 10:58.512
something. That's okay. I've heard that. You 
know, they like this. But when I was in the Army, I

11:03.399 --> 11:08.487
always liked having decisions made for me, too. It 
was a very simple thing, just to march along in the

11:08.770 --> 11:12.354
crowd. Yeah, Lloyd was not that way. You didn't 
have to think. Lloyd was not that way. Is that

11:17.400 --> 11:18.161
right? I think Lloyd was welcomed. Somebody would 
make that decision. That would make decisions in

11:23.708 --> 11:29.074
your own area and follow through and be 
accountable for it. Okay, now, once that decision

11:29.094 --> 11:34.120
was made, how did Lloyd fit into that? Was he highly 
supportive, unsupportive, or watched you to see

11:34.140 --> 11:38.305
if it would work? He always, at first, he wanted me 
to stand by him and see if it would work because I was

11:38.605 --> 11:46.878
new. I'm new in quantity. I don't care how many 
years I take. He wanted to see how that worked. I

11:53.949 --> 11:55.171
think he learned that from California. But I think 
I saw nothing but trust from him to me. He had faith

12:01.581 --> 12:05.206
in me. We didn't have any problems with that. Was 
there, under his regime, I don't want to call it

12:07.073 --> 12:24.381
regime, but anyway, directorship, was there 
pretty good accord in the team, in the staff, in the

12:07.073 --> 12:24.381
group that got into collaboration

12:07.073 --> 12:24.381
or something? I know there were sparks flew here 
and there as we went along in certain areas. And

12:32.858 --> 12:41.009
Lloyd was a gentle man, I always felt. Although I'm 
sure he could have been hard as nails. He had been

12:45.955 --> 12:48.238
Chief Executioner out on the West Coast at some 
point, I've heard. So I'm sure he was quite capable

12:48.258 --> 12:52.764
of dealing with any serious problem in the right 
way. But I always, I didn't have any questions. He

12:56.569 --> 13:02.697
was always supportive to me and was cordial and 
likable. knew so many, we had so many people that we

13:02.947 --> 13:09.276
knew in common from the association. Yeah, the 
whole world. Yeah, we had a good rapport. He and I

13:12.100 --> 13:13.081
did. We talked about things and places and people 
that no one else was talking about. Basically, it

13:19.650 --> 13:23.115
was a happy trip, pretty much. I enjoyed it. What 
were key

13:23.756 --> 13:29.003
projects or books? Do you remember some titles 
that particularly got culture fans thinking?

13:32.275 --> 13:54.460
Yes, the one that got laid

13:32.275 --> 13:54.460
on me was Tom Lee's

13:32.275 --> 13:54.460
book.

13:54.480 --> 13:56.222
He essentially just turned that manuscript over 
to me and said, here, you do this book. And that

13:56.242 --> 13:56.743
helped me a lot. I had to be very firm about some 
matters that were ongoing during the course of

13:56.763 --> 13:58.705
that book. handling with the office. See, I was 
outside my normal role, and I handled it. And I had

14:07.328 --> 14:08.210
to function. Even in some ways, it's 
developmental. Developmental, I think. Now,

14:11.895 --> 14:16.782
that would be the problem where Lloyd is not the 
strong warlord. I see what you're talking about. I

14:19.226 --> 14:20.067
know what you're talking about. But Lloyd wanted 
to delegate that. That's right. They thought he

14:23.172 --> 14:23.933
was His idea was clear that Tom Lee was a tough 
cookie. That's right. We're only going to stay out

14:28.429 --> 14:29.811
of the way. Yeah. He said, here, Jim, you take it. I 
can understand that. You know, uh-oh. You don't

14:35.677 --> 14:36.658
have to elaborate. I understand it. That's good. 
And it was a little frightening at first because I

14:38.820 --> 14:47.489
didn't know Tom Lee except by registration from 
the Oklahoma Press, the great southwestern

14:38.820 --> 14:47.489
painter. And it turned out in that case to be a, It 
was a terrific relationship. I mean it was great.

14:56.184 --> 14:57.867
Now what else besides that? We'll pick that up too. 
That's what I want to do is flag some key items and

14:59.709 --> 15:05.278
kind of make a little to-do about them. Yeah, that 
was a great Easter. That really was. And let's see,

15:09.424 --> 15:11.908
what else?

15:14.673 --> 15:35.373
He

15:14.673 --> 15:35.373
was just here, he and I had been in there two years, 
there, um, 86 and 77. And I was trying to think,

15:35.393 --> 15:36.936
where did Kathleen and Jean, on that, on leave go? 
And, where did we go, um,

15:42.213 --> 16:10.363
Did you feel

15:42.213 --> 16:10.363
like in these years the

15:42.213 --> 16:10.363
press

15:42.213 --> 16:10.363
is really moving ahead? and getting pretty good 
support from the faculty, administration, and

16:10.883 --> 16:15.127
the committee. You felt pretty good about it. 
Yeah. It was so far beyond what I'd been tested to at

16:17.489 --> 16:25.137
either previous post. And then, my gosh, we were, 
well, healed as far as the financial support was

16:25.157 --> 16:35.908
concerned. And it wasn't until later, when we got 
signed, That thread of having to arrive on our

16:40.955 --> 16:45.063
income came to bed. And that was never, ever in June 
until Mowgli years. And, uh, that I ever heard of, I

16:51.996 --> 16:59.190
may have been going on, I just didn't know about it. 
But gosh, we, we had, the university gave us, or

16:59.731 --> 17:04.600
alumni association, gave us what we needed to do a 
job.

17:11.966 --> 17:17.833
And that was the real question, as far as I knew 
about this. That's where it was, yeah, and that's

17:17.853 --> 17:19.775
really important. Yeah, that support was just 
staggering. I just couldn't believe what I was

17:21.257 --> 17:22.759
hearing. Yeah. Wonderful. Wonderful. Now, Lloyd 
left, when, I'm sorry, when did he leave? It was

17:32.251 --> 17:32.812
1987. Okay. And then Stetter comes in about that 
time, and Stetter stays how long ago? 1992? Three?

17:44.353 --> 17:44.554
Four?

17:48.719 --> 17:49.720
That's how long it was? Now, was there a disruption 
in the process as much, or what was the key

17:51.863 --> 18:03.257
ingredient in those years, as you recall? in terms 
of changing impetus within the press or in the

18:03.980 --> 18:13.797
publishing business generally?

18:13.877 --> 18:17.384
I'm really looking for some broad rather than 
specific. I think that we went on through those

18:18.065 --> 18:23.875
years. You can't divorce yourself and your 
personality. It's

18:27.368 --> 18:37.785
not a predefined thing that happens. There's got 
to be many things that happen. And Rick had some

18:40.971 --> 18:49.425
Western hits and production back down. He had a 
good judgment about

18:49.445 --> 18:53.832
design, I always thought. He functioned as an 
editor, and a marketer,

18:54.807 --> 19:11.449
and so

18:54.807 --> 19:11.449
on, and he didn't know that before he came. and

19:12.222 --> 19:23.512
everything that

19:12.222 --> 19:23.512
went with that. He was an enlisted

19:23.532 --> 19:32.680
man, I think, and I certainly could sympathize 
with that. But at a time when the Army wasn't really

19:32.700 --> 19:39.407
the Army I knew, that was a circumstance that may 
have, some of that may have come with it. It was an

19:39.427 --> 19:41.048
unsettled time. Values changed an awful lot in 
those years. And so I saw people come back from

19:46.417 --> 19:53.644
that. That was a big change that I saw. Do you feel 
like the press, the direction of book publishing

19:57.507 --> 20:01.811
changed? Yes, it did. I think the quality of 
scholarship itself changed from what I could see.

20:09.918 --> 20:35.858
the

20:09.918 --> 20:35.858
old heads were fading away and replaced by these 
new people on faculties with a different set of

20:09.918 --> 20:35.858
values and where this didn't matter because they 
always had them and of course this would we would

20:09.918 --> 20:35.858
see this i would see it so many people my age or older 
You see that come through in the manuscripts. In

20:42.067 --> 20:50.720
the times that the material dealt with and the ways 
they were dealt with, the office plan changed. Not

20:50.740 --> 20:56.629
for the better, in my view, but for the better. 
Well, that's a good comment. I came with this a long

20:59.273 --> 21:00.915
time ago. And you might have been disappointed 
with some of the things you got. They were

21:03.952 --> 21:06.195
disappointed in me, too. To see what I'm saying, it 
spilled out on my desk. We had one. I got thrown out.

21:11.281 --> 21:16.928
I did.

21:18.110 --> 21:19.011
Anyway... So you left where? Where did you leave 
your parents? Here. Actually, I started... Rick

21:25.739 --> 21:32.367
and I talked about this. That's right. And

21:33.517 --> 21:42.928
I restructured my job and divided it down the 
middle. Which, interestingly, I proposed they do

21:42.948 --> 21:48.875
it in Oklahoma when I left up there in 1968. And they 
did. They divided it into two roles,

21:50.738 --> 21:58.167
production manager and designer. And so you took 
the job as a designer with you. I just gathered that

22:01.748 --> 22:06.555
part of the function up. And there was no real 
reason that Rick and I could return, even my

22:06.575 --> 22:19.773
sister, for me to stay if it wasn't necessary. And, 
you know, we had confidence in being... Now, had

22:19.793 --> 22:30.928
you been taking your, your, uh, your rest of your 
time before you left, or were you still on the full

22:19.793 --> 22:30.928
payroll? You know, I took, in changing the job 
rate, we reduced my salary to 60% of what it had

22:31.128 --> 22:45.370
been. And I assumed the role of designer and or 
design manager, whatever. That's where the

22:51.259 --> 23:00.072
importance of an even flow of manuscripts and 
editorial to design comes into play. the smoother

23:00.440 --> 23:30.058
and regular that bottle remains the easier and 
better it is to design because time is

23:00.440 --> 23:30.058
forecastable

23:00.440 --> 23:30.058
and you can adjust some books require more design 
and so it's not a matter of just sitting down and

23:00.440 --> 23:30.058
saying it takes seven months to do a book 40 books a 
year that's X months of going to that, you know, and

23:30.562 --> 23:33.728
working that out. So, uh... You were both on kind of 
the same track about that time, because I was, you

23:34.229 --> 23:41.504
know, phasing out of university too, I don't know. 
Half time. Okay, yeah. That's basically what

23:42.787 --> 23:43.829
you're doing. Yeah. And that's what I ended up 
doing. And with the agreement,

23:46.995 --> 23:52.266
uh, I understood. And

23:52.938 --> 24:20.481
when did

23:52.938 --> 24:20.481
you

23:52.938 --> 24:20.481
actually

23:52.938 --> 24:20.481
take

23:52.938 --> 24:20.481
off? It

24:20.950 --> 24:35.377
was in June of 92. And then you would stay on for the 
rest of your life? I stayed on until August of 94.

24:57.265 --> 25:00.569
That's interesting. I don't see any

25:00.589 --> 25:15.428
of that.

25:15.448 --> 25:15.749
It worked well. Rick was pleased. At a point, right 
there at the initial point, in June of 1902, I said,

25:16.129 --> 25:19.273
Rick, I'm going to be down for a month or more, at 
least, in this transitional period. So,

25:19.895 --> 25:45.786
knowing that ahead of time, Susan and I, we got what 
we could out of it, in the way of incoming

25:19.895 --> 25:45.786
manuscripts and playing late games around them. I 
designed them, I had them seen up until about ten,

25:45.806 --> 25:47.448
and I squeezed a few of them. And then the others 
that were anticipated were short during that

25:47.468 --> 25:48.950
downtime. Anticipated? Well,

25:49.983 --> 26:16.643
I was ready to,

25:49.983 --> 26:16.643
sometime in August I'll be ready to do some catch up 
here. So, whatever. Well, I think you really

26:16.943 --> 26:17.644
wanted to. research

26:18.130 --> 26:39.422
and doing manuscripts in that summer into the 
fall. And so there was non-productivity if you

26:39.442 --> 26:40.664
were coming through. But if you were production 
reports, you'd see exactly what happened. And

26:42.066 --> 26:43.007
editorial arrangements of problems with it. It 
wasn't necessarily their fault, it was just the

26:44.033 --> 26:52.842
way things sort of fell together, or didn't fall 
together. And author problems, and authors got, I

26:52.942 --> 27:04.274
don't know, I don't know, could be sick and just not 
get the manuscripts in as planned, or out of the

26:52.942 --> 27:04.274
country, God knows what. So it was the end of the 
year before we started resuming.

27:14.037 --> 27:36.719
So if you had some kind of a concern, and you think 
about this in the weeks that are next to come, and it

27:14.037 --> 27:36.719
confuses on how you would characterize the Texas 
A&M University class among the world of college

27:14.037 --> 27:36.719
professors, is there any kind of special 
identification or description or

27:14.037 --> 27:36.719
characterization? Think about that. It's known 
for just the type of reaction that most people have

27:38.280 --> 27:43.065
to that. It's known

27:43.400 --> 28:03.818
for nice art books,

27:43.400 --> 28:03.818
colorful books, and maybe more of that than the 
heavy scholarly numbers like an Ivy League press.

28:03.838 --> 28:07.582
Presidential papers did not hurt the press. I 
think the Bush papers, I assume they did. I hope so.

28:08.963 --> 28:10.264
If they did, it'll hurt the press. I hope we can 
get... Yeah,

28:12.138 --> 28:29.627
I

28:12.138 --> 28:29.627
don't know

28:12.138 --> 28:29.627
what's happening next week. I'm going to talk to 
Noel and Tom and just say, come on, stop us. Yeah, I

28:35.918 --> 28:37.420
know.
