00:05.617 --> 00:09.141
On the request of Doctor Village Mayor San 
Antonio. He asked me to present to you a tape. Of

00:14.747 --> 00:20.874
some of the reasons why I went to veterinary school 
where I started my type of practice and this type of

00:14.747 --> 00:20.874
thing. I would try to put this in some kind of form. I 
will also send you a copy of my resume so maybe you

00:25.960 --> 00:30.185
can. Put it all together from this tape and also 
from. my resume. I was born and raised in Amarillo,

00:38.889 --> 00:48.259
Texas, and lived in Texas Panhandle all my life, 
basically a city boy. I worked on a local ranch

00:49.801 --> 01:02.555
during the summer months, but I made most of my 
spending money doing construction work with a

00:49.801 --> 01:02.555
local construction company in Amarillo. Upon 
graduation from high school I

01:06.991 --> 01:32.307
joined the United States Marine Corps was in the 
Marine Corps for two years and after that I

01:06.991 --> 01:32.307
returned to go to Texas Tech to play in a football 
with the on a football scholarship I was there for a

01:06.991 --> 01:32.307
year and Met my wife, married in 1959, and she was

01:32.995 --> 01:44.314
going to school in Amarillo at Northwest Texas 
Nursing School. So I transferred back to West

01:45.536 --> 01:54.632
Texas State University and started in a general ag 
degree program. While I was in general ag, I had a

01:55.743 --> 02:03.430
professor ask me what I was going to be able to do 
once I graduated from college. Just being a city

02:05.652 --> 02:17.283
boy and not having a ranch background or farm 
background or someplace I could go, I was

02:05.652 --> 02:17.283
concerned about what my program could be. My wife 
suggested I go to veterinary school since I was

02:18.063 --> 02:25.530
constantly visiting with veterinarians and 
going on calls with them. So in January of 1961,

02:26.911 --> 02:38.886
we transferred to College Station to start 
attending Texas A&M University.

02:42.951 --> 02:49.339
There in Texas A&M, I graduated in August 1965. And 
upon graduation, I returned to Amarillo

02:56.442 --> 02:58.204
primarily in equine practice. During this equine 
practice, I also did the excess swine work and

02:59.766 --> 03:10.621
bovine work. And during this time, I got very much 
interested in doing swine herd health

03:10.641 --> 03:26.382
management, which gave me a good background as far 
as what happened into my practice as I got into

03:10.641 --> 03:26.382
doing bovine herd health management. But I was 
there at this equine practice for nine months. I

03:35.537 --> 03:37.480
decided I wanted to get out on my own. So I went to a 
small town 65 miles southwest of Amarillo, a town

03:38.301 --> 03:47.674
called Demet. So we moved to Demet in June of 1966 
and set up a general practice. I was the first

03:55.437 --> 04:00.863
veterinarian to ever set up practice in Demet. 
There were a few that had been through Demet and

04:00.883 --> 04:08.331
done some work around Demet, but we were the first 
to start. And it was fun times whenever you try to go

04:09.091 --> 04:17.000
into a small town and set up a business the way we 
did. Small town of 5,000 people. They were very

04:20.884 --> 04:23.807
open, very receptive. and very helpful in while we 
were doing our practice. While I was in Demet, the

04:29.345 --> 04:49.069
feeding industry in the Texas Panhandle started 
booming and therefore I started doing some

04:29.345 --> 04:49.069
so-called feedlot medicine in some of these feed 
yards. There was primarily still a fire engine

04:49.149 --> 04:52.613
type calls going to do autopsies of the dead 
cattle. But as we got more involved, we became more

04:56.391 --> 05:06.020
involved in the management aspects and tried to 
set up herd health programs. During all this time

05:06.040 --> 05:13.487
also, I was getting more and more involved in the 
swine herd health consultation. I was doing

05:14.648 --> 05:19.152
DCAB's work out of Illinois. They were setting up 
some large, to finish operations in Plains,

05:22.613 --> 05:26.076
Kansas. And so I was doing their work primarily in 
Plains. And during this time, I was learning about

05:32.382 --> 05:39.129
how to set up a herd health management program. 
Then as we got a little more involved in Dimit, we

05:40.550 --> 05:49.178
developed our practice into a three-person 
practice. and I was doing more and more of the herd

05:50.761 --> 05:57.992
health management or feedlot consultation. So in 
June of 1974, actually in January 1974, we sold our

05:58.012 --> 06:14.056
practice to my partner and I wanted to set up just a 
straight herd health consultation practice. I

06:15.238 --> 06:18.523
stayed in Demet from January to June till the kids 
got out of high school and then we transferred over

06:19.263 --> 06:33.746
to Canyon in June of 1974 and set up just a herd 
health consultation practice. At this time all I

06:33.766 --> 06:45.304
had was an office and my pickup and an airplane and 
was doing primarily feedlots in the 150 mile

06:45.790 --> 06:56.707
radius of Amarillo, but also had some others in 
South Texas and up in Wyoming. So as we got more

06:56.727 --> 07:02.396
involved in the consultation, we also had to do 
more traveling. I made a decision in 1976 to quit

07:03.878 --> 07:13.333
doing any swine consultation and devote myself to 
full-time feedlot herd health consultation. So

07:17.655 --> 07:22.382
we went from a general practice into swine and 
feedlot consultation practice. Now we call

07:22.482 --> 07:29.552
ourselves adjunct manager of animal health in a 
herd health management program. So we've seen

07:30.533 --> 07:41.548
several different kinds of changes in our 
practice and our thoughts of how we should provide

07:30.533 --> 07:41.548
veterinary medicine to some of our clients.

07:49.358 --> 08:01.214
While I was in veterinary school, there was not 
anything being taught on herd health

07:49.358 --> 08:01.214
consultation, not only in swine, but definitely 
not in feedlots. The feedlot industry really

08:02.576 --> 08:09.044
didn't start booming until about 1965 in the Texas 
Panhandle. So I was very weak in the herd health

08:10.947 --> 08:17.796
consultation program, and the swine, like I 
mentioned earlier, the The swine practice was a

08:18.485 --> 08:26.837
good stepping stone because of their advancement 
in the herd health consultation. But at the same

08:28.078 --> 08:38.653
time, it made me get interested in organized 
veterinary medicine because that was one place to

08:28.078 --> 08:38.653
get educated. So I was involved with the swine 
practitioners at the beginning, was a charter

08:39.794 --> 08:47.445
member of the swine practitioners. and then 
joined the bovine practitioners right out of

08:48.758 --> 08:54.805
school in 1965. Same way with the AVMA. And we were 
constantly trying to put different programs

08:59.851 --> 09:08.801
primarily about feedlot medicine with our local 
veterinary association. Then at the same time, we

09:09.923 --> 09:15.289
got involved with the Texas Veterinary Medical 
Association and set up uh, feedlot committees,

09:15.843 --> 09:30.743
uh, feedlot programs, and could see where not only 
would, uh, herd health management consultation,

09:15.843 --> 09:30.743
feedlot management, so to speak, uh, it wasn't 
just tied into one type of practice. It could be

09:30.763 --> 09:38.834
applied also into a dairy practice, into stocker 
practice, cow calf practice. So there was a lot of

09:38.854 --> 09:45.563
good things were coming out of this and, and got 
deeply involved in, organized veterinary

09:45.998 --> 09:49.142
medicine. We formed a group called the Academy of 
Veterinary Consultants in Amarillo just for this

09:49.162 --> 09:56.910
purpose in 1972. And so here again, this was where 
we started getting our education in becoming

09:58.612 --> 10:07.062
feedlot veterinarians. Another thing that was a 
big problem in herd health consultation, the

10:13.707 --> 10:21.158
feedlot medicine was the lack of records. Most of 
these feedlots had some type of record system for

10:21.178 --> 10:35.420
accounting purposes, for figuring out the cost to 
gain, feed efficiency, and billing purposes to

10:21.178 --> 10:35.420
their customers. But no one really had a program to 
set up for evaluating the health of the animals. So

10:44.333 --> 11:04.275
we started putting records together and trying to 
come up a way where we could evaluate our herd

10:44.333 --> 11:04.275
health programs and at the same time come up with a 
goal setting session and have some records to show

10:44.333 --> 11:04.275
whether we were going to be able to make these goals 
or not. We started off with hand records. Then we

11:08.120 --> 11:11.203
started getting into The computer age, but prior 
to for floppies and laptop computers, this type of

11:11.757 --> 11:26.816
thing ever came available, we started using a 
DEC-10 program out of West Texas State

11:11.757 --> 11:26.816
University. We had a telephone modem in our office 
hooked up straight to the West Texas State

11:27.817 --> 11:38.490
University computer office, and we developed a 
system called the Cadillac counting system. this

11:39.500 --> 12:03.128
cattle counting system we can evaluate our 
processing programs our treatment programs

11:39.500 --> 12:03.128
evaluate the origin of the cattle and set up some 
good good programs and and today this thing is

11:39.500 --> 12:03.128
still existence we started this thing at first 
with the wt program and as we got bigger we could

11:39.500 --> 12:03.128
find out that we needed to get off that because it 
cost us too much money on a monthly lease. So we went

12:08.160 --> 12:24.711
into the

12:08.160 --> 12:24.711
small computers, the floppy disk, and the program 
was so large on the deck 10, it took us almost two

12:08.160 --> 12:24.711
years to get it transferred over into the floppy. 
But now we do have this in use and are using it in our

12:25.298 --> 12:31.025
practice. I use it on a routine basis myself with 
the feedlots that I'm consulting with. And as far

12:38.133 --> 12:47.303
as I know, back when we did this, it was the first 
herd health record system designed for a feedlot

12:38.133 --> 12:47.303
herd health program. Now as we get more and more 
involved in our feedlot programs, The drug

12:53.716 --> 13:00.164
companies were coming to us to try to evaluate 
different products. And so I went ahead and

13:01.766 --> 13:11.538
started a small research farm in 1979 and 1980. I 
had a small facility where I could handle about 80

13:11.578 --> 13:16.804
head of cattle. And as the drug companies became 
involved and found out that I was interested in

13:18.370 --> 13:27.404
doing applied research in cattle, we started 
getting more requests. And so we've grown now from

13:27.484 --> 13:36.558
80 head capacity research facility to 2,500 head 
research facility. We started out primarily

13:37.640 --> 13:45.812
doing pharmaceuticals, but now we are doing not 
only pharmaceuticals but biologicals. feed

13:46.636 --> 13:52.924
additives, growth promotings, which includes 
the implants, this type of thing. We started out

13:52.944 --> 13:54.707
primarily in cattle. We did a little bit of horse 
research, and now we also have facilities where we

13:54.747 --> 14:01.956
can do swine research. So it seems like we've gone 
in a complete circle. Started out with general

14:06.362 --> 14:11.749
practice in Demet, built that practice up to a 
three-person practice. Now we're back into a

14:16.268 --> 14:17.590
general practice again. One time we had six people 
in our program. Now we're just back to three. But we

14:23.798 --> 14:32.069
have a veterinarian running the general practice 
in town, which includes small animal, horses,

14:23.798 --> 14:32.069
cattle.

14:33.090 --> 14:37.556
We have one veterinarian doing primarily nothing 
but consultation. And then I'm doing

14:38.858 --> 14:44.545
consultation plus the research facility. So That 
kind of gives you a little bit of an idea of what

14:46.795 --> 15:04.247
we've done over the years since graduation and 
trying to figure out how we can be of more service to

14:46.795 --> 15:04.247
our clients and provide a good program in herd 
health management.

15:13.407 --> 15:29.381
Another aspect of our business that I've been 
excited about was back in 1974, I was contacted by

15:13.407 --> 15:29.381
3M Company to be a consultant with them on some new 
products, new ideas. One of the ideas they had was a

15:30.522 --> 15:41.372
compressed air rifle that shoots a biodegradable 
bullet, which contains a life-size dry vaccine.

15:42.483 --> 15:55.996
and use this in cattle to help eliminate some 
stress and some of the other things that are

15:42.483 --> 15:55.996
involved as far as when trying to vaccinate cattle 
in a pasture situation. So I was consulting from

15:56.016 --> 16:00.380
them for a year and a half. Then as this became more 
of a product rather than an idea, a company called

16:01.081 --> 16:10.650
Blistavet, was formed. A list of that is out of 
Minneapolis St. Paul. Mr. Fred Paul, who put this

16:16.999 --> 16:22.331
idea together, is the one that started the 
company. And he bought the rights from 3M. And

16:27.978 --> 16:35.386
during all this time, there was about $3 million 
spent on just the development of it. It took from, I

16:36.007 --> 16:40.472
said 1974, but I meant 1972. From 1972 to about 
1976, being in development, 76 to 84, it was pretty

16:41.253 --> 16:55.369
much put on a shelf and not used. 84, Fred Paul 
purchased the selling rights of this company and

16:55.484 --> 17:03.135
formed his own company, BlistaVet. And in 1985, I 
was hired as an advisor with BlistaVet to work on

17:03.455 --> 17:15.913
this new compressed air rifle idea. And now we have 
been working with them since 1985, been working on

17:22.045 --> 17:32.978
new product development, trying to put a 
marketing scheme together so other

17:22.045 --> 17:32.978
veterinarians can be aware of this program and 
this system. Also on the advisory stage is a FDA

17:34.139 --> 17:45.632
liaison person with my contact with the FDA from a 
research program and a feedlot program. I also

17:46.954 --> 17:50.618
work with the FDA for BallistaVet in trying to set 
up new protocols and get some of these products

17:51.121 --> 17:56.387
approved. And at the same time we also, with these 
products, we work on the research end of it here at

17:57.689 --> 18:05.298
the research farm. So that has been a very 
interesting part in trying to develop new ideas

18:05.318 --> 18:13.247
and new products. I'm also getting more and more 
involved with international consultation. This

18:20.116 --> 18:27.686
looks like this might be some value and interest as 
we get further and further along into our

18:20.116 --> 18:27.686
programs. I was just just returned from South 
Africa and was over there for 30 days. I was hired by

18:35.516 --> 18:41.985
a veterinarian and 14 other companies to come over 
and go through their feedlot program with them.

18:46.059 --> 18:50.384
That's one of the best unknown secrets in the 
world, I believe, over there. They're the second

18:50.484 --> 18:56.871
largest cattle feeding country in the world, 
besides the United States and Canada. And they've

18:56.891 --> 19:01.356
got a very viable, very interesting industry. And 
I was able to go over there and spend 30 days with

19:01.376 --> 19:06.842
them, and going through their program, 
evaluating them, and looking at the way they do

19:07.261 --> 19:09.463
things. We're very spoiled in the United States. 
We have a lot of biologics, a lot of

19:11.886 --> 19:22.837
pharmaceuticals, and there's things that we can 
do in the United States that they can't do because

19:11.886 --> 19:22.837
they don't have these products available. At the 
present time, all they have is an inactivated IBR,

19:23.077 --> 19:37.251
an intradermal Pasteurella, and TSV-2 
intranasal IBR-PI3. During my visit while I was

19:37.923 --> 19:51.724
there, we also worked with the drug companies 
which were also help sponsoring the program and

19:37.923 --> 19:51.724
show them the type of programs we were using in the 
United States and some of the things they needed to

19:37.923 --> 19:51.724
do there. So we are able to develop new tools for 
these people while we were there and give them some

19:52.485 --> 20:04.183
new things that they can utilize in their program. 
That has been very interesting to do some

20:04.349 --> 20:07.613
international work. Also, I'm getting involved 
with a society called American Society of Ag

20:08.494 --> 20:16.363
Consultants out of Washington, DC. Here again, 
they have a domestic program, the United States

20:17.665 --> 20:24.352
program, but they also have a lot of international 
work. So I think down the line, international

20:24.372 --> 20:33.563
consultation will be something that we as 
veterinarians will have to offer to some of these

20:34.083 --> 20:40.398
other countries of some of the things that we are 
doing in the United States. If you have any

20:41.500 --> 20:45.790
questions over any of this, please don't hesitate 
to call. I hope these tapes will be of some value to

20:45.911 --> 20:47.835
you. Thank you.
