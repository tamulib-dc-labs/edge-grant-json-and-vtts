00:02.714 --> 00:05.519
Testing, testing, testing, one, two, three.

00:05.980 --> 00:08.083
One, two, three, testing, testing, testing.

00:09.686 --> 00:11.048
This is December 14.

00:11.109 --> 00:18.101
We're in the Evans Library, and I have the honor and pleasure of chatting with Dr. George Bass.

00:18.161 --> 00:22.969
The director, is that the title, of the underwater?

00:23.430 --> 00:24.672
I am the

00:25.023 --> 00:30.711
founder of the Institute of Nautical Archaeology, which affiliated with Texas A&M in 1976.

00:31.492 --> 00:34.937
And I was then the first head of the Nautical Archaeology program.

00:35.537 --> 00:40.705
But now I'm simply a retiring professor and will be retired in a few weeks.

00:41.365 --> 00:49.056
To introduce yourself to anyone who would hear this tape or read the transcript of it, give us a biographical summary.

00:49.458 --> 00:50.440
before you got here?

00:50.520 --> 00:51.262
Where did you grow up?

00:51.342 --> 00:52.445
What did mom and dad do?

00:52.485 --> 00:53.327
Where did you go to school?

00:53.407 --> 00:56.374
Where did you serve before A&M?

00:57.236 --> 01:02.970
I was born on December 9, 1932, in Columbia, South Carolina.

01:04.092 --> 01:07.821
My grandfather, George Walkup, was the head of the

01:08.138 --> 01:16.940
English Department, lived in the only house still standing after the Civil War in Columbia, which is now the President's home, but it's called the Walk-Up House.

01:17.883 --> 01:19.166
So I saw a lot of the campus.

01:19.527 --> 01:24.780
My mother met my father when he came.

01:24.760 --> 01:28.565
from the farm to major in English and they got married.

01:28.585 --> 01:36.657
My father then became an English professor there, but shortly before the war was called into active duty in the Navy and went to Annapolis.

01:37.238 --> 01:41.223
So I really, from the age of eight on, was a Marylander.

01:42.205 --> 01:43.967
I went to Johns Hopkins University.

01:45.112 --> 01:49.959
followed by where I got a master's degree in Eastern Archaeology.

01:50.099 --> 01:51.521
I do not have a bachelor's degree.

01:51.541 --> 01:56.788
There was a plan that you could do that, followed by two years at the American School of Classical Studies at Athens.

01:57.590 --> 02:00.273
At that time, I was called on to active duty in the Army.

02:00.333 --> 02:12.891
It was after the Korean War, but I spent most of my time in Korea, came out in 1959, and then I needed German for graduate school.

02:13.259 --> 02:17.624
And my father by then was teaching at Furman University in Greenville, South Carolina.

02:17.704 --> 02:25.814
And so in summer school, I was in a class, a German class, and a very bright, attractive young woman sitting in front of me.

02:25.914 --> 02:30.379
Ann Singletary was studying German for her graduate work at the Eastman School of Music.

02:30.999 --> 02:35.244
And so we went out and got engaged.

02:35.324 --> 02:40.110
And then I went on to the University of Pennsylvania to be in my

02:40.782 --> 02:47.419
doctoral studies, and she went to the Eastman School to work on her master's degree in music.

02:47.439 --> 02:56.783
I had already, as a student in Greece between 55 and 57, had the opportunity to work on land digs, one in Greece and one in Turkey,

02:57.168 --> 03:02.593
The one in Turkey was directed at a place called Gordian, where King Midas was the king.

03:03.374 --> 03:09.180
And the director was Rodney Young, the head of the classical archaeology department at the University of Pennsylvania.

03:11.402 --> 03:25.015
He clearly thought highly of my fieldwork, because he tried to get me to direct within a few months after my appearance at Penn, was looking for an excavation for me to direct.

03:24.995 --> 03:26.959
One in Libya fell through.

03:26.979 --> 03:29.866
The sponsor chose someone else.

03:30.227 --> 03:35.578
But then one day he said he had a letter from someone who had found a Bronze Age shipwreck off the coast of Turkey.

03:35.639 --> 03:44.438
And this person said that he was curious to see whether one could excavate underwater as carefully as people excavated on land.

03:44.738 --> 03:49.583
And with the University of Pennsylvania Museum, sponsor an expedition to see if this was possible.

03:50.064 --> 03:53.388
So Rodney Young asked me if I'd like to learn how to dive to be the archaeologist.

03:53.948 --> 03:59.755
I took six lessons of a 10-lesson YMCA course and left for Turkey in April.

04:00.696 --> 04:07.764
And that's how Underwater Archaeology really got started because that was the first shipwreck ever excavated in its entirety on the seabed.

04:08.324 --> 04:09.205
Now, when was that?

04:09.225 --> 04:09.566
What year?

04:09.626 --> 04:11.488
That was the summer of 1960.

04:11.975 --> 04:24.506
The person who had found the wreck was a New York photojournalist, Peter Throckmorton, who is no longer alive, but he is really, people often say I'm the father of underwater archaeology, but it was his idea.

04:24.546 --> 04:28.836
The Bodrum Museum, which is the finest museum of underwater archaeology now in the

04:29.035 --> 04:30.697
the whole Mediterranean there in Turkey.

04:31.118 --> 04:32.059
That was his idea.

04:32.099 --> 04:38.228
He had, however, no college degree, and so he didn't have the credentials to do what I could do.

04:38.989 --> 04:43.055
And so we really ran the project together that first year.

04:43.615 --> 04:46.880
My wife had never been out of the United States.

04:47.661 --> 04:50.605
Oh, we got married, I forgot, in March.

04:50.753 --> 04:51.594
I left in April.

04:51.634 --> 04:52.755
We had no honeymoon.

04:52.895 --> 04:54.537
We had one or two days together.

04:55.437 --> 04:58.420
And then she was to join me three months later when she finished her master's degree.

04:59.581 --> 05:06.648
And so she assumed that wherever she would go with her new husband, she'd have at least an upright piano, maybe not a baby grand.

05:07.088 --> 05:17.638
So she had, when she got to Turkey, and took a bus all by herself halfway across Turkey on unpaved roads, and then got a fishing boat to bring us out overnight to the camp, and she arrived.

05:18.108 --> 05:35.769
with two suitcases, one full of music, piano music, and one with clothes, and then she saw the pup tent on the beach where we were to spend the next three months, where there was a cliff all around us, and sometimes the rocks would fall down at night, and we'd all run out and stand in the sea waist deep until we figured there'd not be a landslide, and then go back to bed.

05:36.210 --> 05:37.112
That's how it all started.

05:38.375 --> 05:40.418
And it kept going.

05:40.438 --> 05:40.739
Okay.

05:41.400 --> 05:46.709
So I stayed on, continued the underwater work.

05:47.570 --> 05:58.148
I was going to go back to land archaeology, but we had a Frenchman and a German with us, and the Frenchman, in fact, had lent me the pup tent because I didn't have one where Ann and I spent our honeymoon for three months.

05:58.188 --> 06:02.796
His name is Claude Dutwy, and I mention his name because his name will come up later.

06:02.776 --> 06:10.867
And he said, look, we've really started something good now, this underwater archaeology, and we can't do it without you because you're the only archaeologist in the group.

06:10.988 --> 06:11.789
They were just divers.

06:12.289 --> 06:13.010
So come on back.

06:13.091 --> 06:17.697
And so they convinced me to come back the next year to Turkey, and we would do a Byzantine shipwreck.

06:18.418 --> 06:26.910
And so the next four years, while I was working on my doctorate at Penn, I did a Byzantine ship, and we spent

06:26.890 --> 06:31.075
a great deal of time developing new techniques for working beneath the sea.

06:31.115 --> 06:52.761
For example, in 1963, when I was still a graduate student, I placed an order, I raised the money, and placed an order with General Dynamics, Electric Boat Division in Groton, Connecticut, to build the first privately owned research submersible in the history of the United States, called the Asherah, after a Phoenician sea goddess, and we took it to Turkey in 64 and again in 67, and that was the pioneer.

06:53.762 --> 06:55.564
I don't think there are many people that know that

06:55.898 --> 07:09.719
You know, some archaeologists did that or developed the first method of mapping the seabed with stereophotography when the Navy and the National Geographic Cartographic Department and top aerial surveys all said it was impossible, it was too complex.

07:10.761 --> 07:15.468
So we invented a number of things in those early years to make diving more efficient.

07:16.129 --> 07:19.234
And this was all under the auspices of the University of Pennsylvania?

07:19.254 --> 07:22.058
That was all while I was still a graduate student at the University of Pennsylvania.

07:22.595 --> 07:25.860
I got my doctorate in 1964 and joined the faculty.

07:26.701 --> 07:40.280
And then it's interesting, it's ironic that Turkey has just passed a new rule this year saying you cannot direct an excavation unless you're at least an associate professor.

07:40.861 --> 07:43.445
You cannot direct a survey unless you're at least an assistant professor.

07:44.066 --> 07:51.336
Well, as soon as I began to teach, I didn't have so much time to dig and publish, so I only went back in 67 and 69.

07:51.653 --> 07:55.437
until I left Penn in 1973 to do underwater archaeology.

07:55.938 --> 08:17.222
The finest underwater archaeology done around the world from the Caribbean to the Mediterranean, whether in Cyprus or in Turkey or probably there are other countries that I could think of, has been done by graduate students because they have the time to devote 100 percent of their energy to it and not, you know, teaching and administering and that sort of thing.

08:17.540 --> 08:22.529
So I stayed on the faculty and we did another Byzantine rec in those years.

08:22.690 --> 08:39.261
And then in 1969, so I'm getting close to Texas A&M, in 1969 one of our dearest friends in this group, Eric Ryan, who was the head of the art department at Colgate University, had an embolism.

08:39.747 --> 08:47.920
Luckily, we had a doctor in the recompression chamber, and he was treated and lived, but he never recovered sensation down the left side of his body.

08:48.481 --> 08:52.347
And just a year or two later, when he was about 40 years old, he died of pneumonia.

08:52.808 --> 08:56.274
Whether this contributed or not, we'll never know, but he never seemed to be strong again.

08:57.195 --> 09:00.861
That same summer, just a month later, a sponge diver was brought to us

09:00.841 --> 09:12.488
who had had the bends in very bad shape and he was put into the chamber and seemed to be getting better and then he began calling for his wife and mother and died in the chamber and then I was locked in

09:12.856 --> 09:20.526
keep the doctor company and I'd never been around a dead person before but I sat in there for six hours as the pressure was released.

09:21.167 --> 09:29.098
These two things upset me so much that I thought I've had now a good decade.

09:30.240 --> 09:36.588
I don't want to take a dead friend out of the water ever and it's hazardous work and so I left the field of underwater archaeology.

09:36.628 --> 09:37.750
I remember writing to the

09:37.730 --> 09:46.684
President of the National Geographic and saying, you know, here I'm just not even 40 years old and I'm going to have a completely new life.

09:47.044 --> 09:54.055
And so I started a land dig in southern Italy in 1971.

09:54.075 --> 10:02.168
And as we were digging, finding little tiny pieces of broken pottery, I kept thinking,

10:03.734 --> 10:06.941
A wreck is so much better preserved than this.

10:07.742 --> 10:21.692
We were trying to see the origins of animal husbandry in this part of Italy, about 6000 BC, and I thought there might be a wreck between Yugoslavia and Italy where this information is going to be better found.

10:21.672 --> 10:25.576
And when I'd go to Bari or someplace on the sea, I miss the smell of the sea.

10:26.197 --> 10:31.062
I miss the camaraderie of an underwater excavation, where you have such a greater mix of people.

10:31.102 --> 10:34.026
On a land dig, you may have six archaeologists.

10:34.426 --> 10:35.487
So you just talk archaeology.

10:35.547 --> 10:37.670
On an underwater dig, you have a chief diver.

10:37.690 --> 10:38.871
You have a mechanic.

10:38.911 --> 10:40.233
You have a physician.

10:40.293 --> 10:43.496
You have a great variety of people.

10:44.097 --> 10:45.398
And we're all learning from one another.

10:45.418 --> 10:50.464
And I like the interdisciplinary nature of it.

10:50.714 --> 10:58.326
In 1969, when all these things had happened, I was teaching a full-time teacher at Penn, running what the head of U.S.

10:58.366 --> 11:03.414
Navy in diving and salvage said was the largest diving operation in the world.

11:03.514 --> 11:08.802
He said nobody else in the world has 20 people going down to 130 feet twice a day for three months.

11:09.303 --> 11:13.610
I was doing it without any secretary, without any student assistant.

11:13.970 --> 11:16.975
Ann used to help me tremendously, even when she was teaching music.

11:17.326 --> 11:22.393
I raised enough money to hire a graduate assistant, but I think that I just got burned out.

11:22.854 --> 11:24.897
And I started the land dig in Italy, but then I missed it.

11:25.498 --> 11:32.728
So I thought, well, instead of being driven out of the field because of the problems, maybe the thing to do is to overcome the problems.

11:33.349 --> 11:38.136
And so with Fred Van Dornick, who had been a fellow graduate student with me from 1961,

11:38.825 --> 11:49.656
We, in the summer of 1972, started dreaming of an institute devoted to nautical archaeology, which is what we then called our field, Shipwreck Archaeology.

11:50.376 --> 11:52.478
And so I decided to leave Penn.

11:54.220 --> 11:54.620
No, I didn't.

11:54.660 --> 12:04.630
I decided to form an institute devoted to this new field of nautical archaeology so that we could devote our full attention to it.

12:04.913 --> 12:18.729
wrote a paper, which I still have somewhere on file, I assume, and proposed to the University of Pennsylvania Museum an institute of nautical archaeology, and I would be the head of it.

12:19.249 --> 12:20.291
I asked for three things.

12:20.431 --> 12:28.320
I said I would like to be a non-teaching person because it would just take too much time to be a full-time teacher and run this.

12:28.800 --> 12:31.984
I wanted also to have something that would allow us to

12:32.487 --> 12:35.072
work in the field for more than three months at a time.

12:36.375 --> 12:40.704
Traditionally, archaeology was done during faculty summer vacations.

12:41.325 --> 12:48.640
Well, if you go to Turkey and you have only three months, you have to ship your equipment over, you have to get it through customs, then you go to Ankara and spend

12:48.873 --> 12:51.015
a week or two or three, getting the permit.

12:51.376 --> 12:55.460
And then you go out and you put up your camp, and you get your barge in place.

12:55.961 --> 12:59.164
And then you die for six weeks, and then you have to tear everything down and put things away.

12:59.685 --> 13:05.451
And so if you raise a certain amount of money, I'd say 80% of it's gone the first day you die.

13:05.972 --> 13:07.794
And then it's just fuel and food.

13:08.054 --> 13:13.861
So you could triple your efficiency if you could work for three or four months at a time.

13:14.401 --> 13:18.846
So I said, I want the ability to go abroad for six months, a year, whatever it took.

13:18.826 --> 13:25.277
And I said, and I want to ask the museum for a penny, not even for my own salary.

13:25.357 --> 13:26.900
I'll go out and try to raise it.

13:27.821 --> 13:29.564
And then there was a third thing.

13:30.406 --> 13:32.269
But at any rate, the museum said I couldn't have any of those.

13:32.349 --> 13:33.931
It said that would set a precedent.

13:33.952 --> 13:35.434
You have to be a teacher.

13:35.414 --> 13:54.217
And so I went and I thought about it, and without any idea whatsoever where I'd get the money, I sent a year's notice that I was resigning with a tenured physician at the University of Pennsylvania, where I'd been groomed to be the next department chairman, and that department was thought to be the best department of classical archaeology in the nation.

13:55.038 --> 13:57.000
Now, why did I do this?

13:57.605 --> 14:05.220
The head of the department, Rodney Young, who had first asked me to learn to dive, clearly was grooming me to take over when he retired in just two or three years.

14:05.981 --> 14:08.386
He was, I know, quite sad when I left.

14:09.548 --> 14:13.475
But he looked at me and said, I'm sad you're leaving, but you have to leave, and I can understand.

14:13.856 --> 14:15.900
You've got the 40 fidgets.

14:16.150 --> 14:17.672
And I just was turning 40.

14:17.772 --> 14:23.017
He said that's when he changed and came to Penn from Greece where he had a chance to make his career.

14:23.658 --> 14:25.620
So it was the 40 fidgets was part of it.

14:25.660 --> 14:30.024
And there was another part which I've seldom revealed, but I'll go ahead and reveal it now.

14:31.005 --> 14:36.011
Part of the reason for forming the Institute was based on my fear of flying.

14:36.531 --> 14:38.874
I crossed the Atlantic 28 times by ship.

14:39.654 --> 14:43.238
Before I ever flew across, I had a tremendous phobia about planes.

14:43.218 --> 14:46.042
which I'm over now, but I fly a lot now.

14:46.623 --> 14:49.047
But nothing, nothing.

14:49.127 --> 14:59.862
I even had an invitation once to the White House to have lunch with President Kennedy, and I was too embarrassed to say why I couldn't come, but I just would not have flown across the Atlantic for anything.

15:00.023 --> 15:05.931
So I think part of this was that I would go over it during the nice summer when the weather's not so bad and come back the next summer.

15:07.333 --> 15:10.558
But at any rate, they say I couldn't have any of these things, so I sent in the letter of resignation.

15:12.597 --> 15:14.860
The director of the museum came and said, you're leaving.

15:14.940 --> 15:15.021
Why?

15:15.521 --> 15:18.486
And I said, well, I wanted these three things, and you said I couldn't have them.

15:19.126 --> 15:20.368
He said, oh, we could work that out.

15:20.569 --> 15:21.550
And I said, well, it's too late.

15:21.690 --> 15:22.391
We didn't, did we?

15:22.612 --> 15:26.016
And the chairman of the board had echoed him, saying, you can't have these things.

15:26.077 --> 15:36.732
And I pointed out that the precedent had already been set, that the head of their scientific laboratories, carbon-14 and tree-ring dating, was a non-teaching member of the museum.

15:36.712 --> 15:37.814
He said, well, I guess you're right.

15:38.075 --> 15:39.057
And we remained good friends.

15:39.077 --> 15:40.040
I mean, it was no hard feelings.

15:40.060 --> 15:42.866
But I think I called their bluff, and they didn't think I would.

15:42.926 --> 15:52.628
So my wife and I, in 1973, sold our house, our car, all of our furniture, except her baby grand piano and my grandfather's desk.

15:53.097 --> 15:54.099
pictures off the wall.

15:54.520 --> 15:56.143
Two women came in and put stickers on things.

15:56.543 --> 16:02.034
We sat next to her, watched them take out the children's toys, everything, to move to the island of Cyprus to start a good life.

16:02.855 --> 16:11.511
Cyprus was chosen because one of my students at Penn, Michael Katzev, had gone there and excavated a Greek shipwreck and was still working on it.

16:11.491 --> 16:26.766
Then another little part of this picture comes in, and that is from 1963 on, a man who had an electrical business in Denver, Pennsylvania, about 60 miles or so from Philadelphia, named Dick Steffi.

16:26.746 --> 16:31.613
had read about my work in National Geographic, and he said that he was a very serious model builder.

16:31.653 --> 16:37.122
He wasn't interested in display models, but he liked to make models to see how things worked.

16:37.142 --> 16:43.371
And so he had lectured to my classes, and then Michael Katzebitt got a UNESCO grant for him to come

16:43.351 --> 16:51.663
to Turkey, to Cyprus for a year and put physically put together this fourth century BC Greek ship that they excavated off the coast.

16:51.683 --> 16:55.308
So Michael said, why don't you put your headquarters in Cyprus?

16:55.548 --> 17:00.716
And so I would be president, Michael would be vice president, and Dick was already there.

17:01.217 --> 17:05.022
So we moved to Cyprus, we got there, we drove across

17:05.525 --> 17:06.567
And we had headaches.

17:06.587 --> 17:07.328
We didn't know why.

17:07.749 --> 17:09.452
We found out it was 111 degrees.

17:10.053 --> 17:16.425
Ann sat on the edge of the bed and wept that evening and said, what in the world did I ever want to go live in a desert?

17:16.465 --> 17:17.708
Because that's the way it felt that day.

17:17.788 --> 17:18.409
It was so hot.

17:19.671 --> 17:20.513
But we did.

17:20.813 --> 17:27.145
And I left her to get the kids into English-speaking schools and set up housekeeping when I went off to Turkey.

17:27.563 --> 17:33.692
Let me tell you what we did in order to do this, and that is that I was the highest paid member of the institute as president.

17:33.712 --> 17:35.314
I was making $13,000 a year.

17:35.855 --> 17:37.277
Michael Katz said I was making $8,000.

17:38.258 --> 17:45.628
We hired for $3,000 a year, but we put him up in our house and fed him a young man named John Gifford, who's now on the faculty at the University of Miami.

17:46.389 --> 17:51.216
He only had a master's degree, though, and he was a bachelor, so he only needed $3,000 a year to live on.

17:51.817 --> 17:54.921
We had no fringe benefits, no life insurance, no pension.

17:55.306 --> 18:00.004
No health insurance, but it was a gamble and so that's how we lived for the next two or three years.

18:01.169 --> 18:02.835
I had been headed off for Turkey

18:03.794 --> 18:10.324
and lived in Turkish fishing boats for three months looking for shipwrecks, sleeping in the fish hole, eating in the deck out of a communal pot.

18:10.705 --> 18:17.856
I'm going to mention that when I give my commencement address day after tomorrow, that there are other riches than just monetary.

18:17.876 --> 18:19.919
I mean, it was a wonderful experience.

18:19.939 --> 18:22.443
And we found wrecks that we're still excavating today.

18:22.763 --> 18:24.186
It was a very successful season.

18:24.606 --> 18:27.371
We had a $10,000 grant from the National Geographic Society.

18:27.431 --> 18:31.557
Oh, how did we get the money to even live on $13,000, $12,000?

18:31.975 --> 18:39.526
I wrote to a man named Jack Kelly, a Tulsa businessman, whom I'd known and had often said he'd be interested in supporting something we're doing.

18:40.067 --> 18:43.392
And I said I was leaving Penn to form a private institute of nautical archaeology.

18:44.393 --> 18:49.180
He said immediately, he called me on the phone and said, this is terribly exciting.

18:49.240 --> 18:51.203
I pledge $10,000 a year for the next three years.

18:51.664 --> 18:53.707
And I have a friend I think will do the same.

18:53.847 --> 18:56.691
And that was John Baird, who lived in Cleveland.

18:56.952 --> 19:01.358
And John Baird is 92 years old now and still on our board.

19:01.928 --> 19:03.894
His daughter's now on our board.

19:05.037 --> 19:08.087
Jack served until last year on our board.

19:08.809 --> 19:12.259
And so then Michael Katzeb had one of his sponsors, John Brown Cook,

19:12.610 --> 19:14.612
that pledged 10,000 a year for five years.

19:15.033 --> 19:17.836
And then we got some smaller pledges of 5,000 and 3,000.

19:17.857 --> 19:21.241
But essentially, we had $50,000 a year for the first few years.

19:21.661 --> 19:22.783
But we could get grants.

19:22.803 --> 19:24.745
And I got a grant from the National Geographic Society.

19:25.226 --> 19:35.078
Mel Payne, a founding director, who was at that time either president or chairman of the board of the National Geographic, showed up at our board meeting in Philadelphia with a check for $10,000 for our first survey.

19:35.098 --> 19:38.382
And that's how we hired the Turkish fishing boats that we lived on.

19:39.813 --> 19:44.238
I went back to Cyprus, and things went well there.

19:44.779 --> 19:48.404
And so we started our first field school in the summer of 1974.

19:49.525 --> 19:57.294
And after just about seven or eight days of diving, we heard on the radio that there had been a coup on Cyprus, that the government had been overthrown.

19:57.395 --> 20:07.527
And then, I don't know whether it was the same day or the next day, but very shortly thereafter, the Turkish army and navy crossed to Cyprus because of the Turkish Cypriot population.

20:08.328 --> 20:09.229
And the war broke out.

20:10.222 --> 20:15.066
Ann and I rushed back as soon as we could to see our house.

20:15.106 --> 20:21.532
The excavation was stopped immediately by the military because we were so close to the border with Greece, and people thought a major war may break out.

20:22.032 --> 20:24.974
So I thought that our institute was all over.

20:25.475 --> 20:27.296
Maybe we were in Turkey for two or three weeks.

20:27.316 --> 20:28.157
That's all that summer.

20:28.698 --> 20:30.719
I'd raised money from National Geographic and elsewhere.

20:31.100 --> 20:35.884
And it was very discouraging to think that we had nothing to show for it, what we hadn't really done very much.

20:37.765 --> 20:39.807
So we hurried back.

20:39.787 --> 20:58.993
We realized this was no place to try to continue because some of us lived on the Greek side and some on the Turkish side, so we left Cyprus and that's when one of our group that summer, Pierre Bikai, who was Lebanese, said,

20:58.973 --> 21:04.698
your headquarters in Beirut because we Lebanese are like the good life too much to do anything silly like the Cypriots.

21:04.818 --> 21:13.586
And so we got in this old mini bus that was a rattle trap with our kids and Pierre and drove down through Syria to Lebanon and almost did it.

21:13.606 --> 21:16.449
We got permission to move our headquarters from Cyprus to Beirut.

21:16.629 --> 21:22.975
But something told us not to, luckily, because just a year later their civil war broke out.

21:23.595 --> 21:25.437
So that was the first time I'd ever flown across the Atlantic.

21:25.457 --> 21:26.618
We came back.

21:27.104 --> 21:32.434
Some of the directors said, you know, you just tried to form an institute at the wrong time, why don't you just give up?

21:33.517 --> 21:39.308
And I was making $13,000 a year, and we just bought a little car, a second-hand car in Cyprus.

21:39.348 --> 21:40.510
That had been destroyed in the world.

21:40.530 --> 21:43.176
We sold it for $70 scrap.

21:43.616 --> 21:45.500
We'd just bought some furniture, stoves and stuff.

21:45.520 --> 21:47.003
We just left all that behind.

21:46.983 --> 21:51.268
and we flew home with what we could, and we had to pay overweight for some steamer trunks.

21:51.849 --> 21:56.394
So I suspect that probably in one day I lost, say, $6,000 or $13,000 in my salary.

21:56.975 --> 22:06.787
But still, I went back and I bought, I remember, I bought a $200 suit, the most expensive piece of clothes I'd ever owned, because I didn't want to look like I was coming back with my tail between my legs.

22:07.267 --> 22:13.935
I walked into the University of Pennsylvania standing tall, like everything, it was just rosy, of course not having any idea what we were going to do.

22:14.624 --> 22:26.723
And one of our directors, Betsy Whitehead, who had been a student of mine, an older student when her children grew up, said, you know, my husband, Jack, is setting up the Whitehead Institute at MIT.

22:27.304 --> 22:30.909
And he had made, at that time, the largest philanthropic gift ever made to a university.

22:30.929 --> 22:32.331
It was over $100 million.

22:32.452 --> 22:35.596
And the Whitehead Institute I still read about from time to time.

22:35.637 --> 22:36.598
They're both dead now.

22:36.865 --> 22:38.751
But she said it's going to be affiliated.

22:39.473 --> 22:43.666
It's going to be there at MIT, but it's not going to be part of the university.

22:44.287 --> 22:45.571
But they'll share facilities.

22:45.611 --> 22:47.216
They'll share staff.

22:47.738 --> 22:50.807
And maybe find a university to give you a home.

22:51.614 --> 23:01.851
I had no idea how to shop for a university home, but somehow the University of North Carolina Wilmington campus heard about us and said that they would like to put our institute there.

23:01.871 --> 23:09.043
And so I went down and interviewed several times.

23:09.083 --> 23:10.365
There was an old

23:10.565 --> 23:12.027
Am I going on too long?

23:12.127 --> 23:12.708
No, no, no.

23:12.748 --> 23:15.091
This is exactly what we want.

23:15.271 --> 23:17.414
It's why I came to Texas A&M, it's kind of a funny story.

23:17.815 --> 23:22.581
They had an old brown shingle building built on piers poured out over the water there.

23:22.981 --> 23:25.505
They say they'd give that to us and that could be our headquarters.

23:26.005 --> 23:27.608
And Dick Steffie and I were so thrilled.

23:27.628 --> 23:30.712
Oh yeah, Dick Steffie had joined us shortly before the war broke out.

23:31.673 --> 23:35.398
He said, George, I'd like to, I'm going to backtrack.

23:35.919 --> 23:37.821
Part of the reason I think I had the nerve

23:38.493 --> 23:41.918
to leave Penn without knowing what the future would hold.

23:42.619 --> 23:55.496
Because one day, driving back from looking at some old early 20th century ship remains that had washed up on a beach in New Jersey that some people had told us about, Dick Steffi was with his wife and I was with Ann in two different cars.

23:55.516 --> 23:57.759
And he pulled way over the side of the road, and he came back.

23:58.240 --> 23:59.742
He said, George, I'm going to tell you something.

23:59.722 --> 24:03.467
I've decided to give up my business and become a professional ship reconstructor.

24:04.168 --> 24:05.330
And I said, Dick, you're crazy.

24:05.350 --> 24:06.351
You're going to starve to death.

24:06.972 --> 24:10.057
But that's when he got this UNESCO grant to go to Cyprus.

24:10.277 --> 24:12.961
So that's why he was already there along with the rest of us.

24:14.343 --> 24:18.528
He hadn't actually sold his business, but his brother was running it in his absence.

24:18.548 --> 24:22.053
So he came to me one day and said, George, I really want to be part of this institute.

24:22.754 --> 24:24.016
I said, Dick, I don't have any money.

24:24.076 --> 24:25.498
And he said, well, I really want to be part.

24:25.518 --> 24:27.501
And I said, well, I could maybe offer you a job.

24:28.190 --> 24:29.532
He had two teenage children.

24:31.436 --> 24:34.722
And I was embarrassed.

24:34.742 --> 24:37.627
We were eating pizza right on the harbor front in Karenia.

24:38.589 --> 24:41.975
And finally I said, well, I can offer you $5,000 a year.

24:42.176 --> 24:42.857
He said, I'll take it.

24:43.638 --> 24:44.760
I said, no fringe benefits.

24:45.021 --> 24:45.642
He said, I'll do it.

24:46.803 --> 25:00.562
And I think what's nice is that those of us who gambled the most actually won the most because Dick ended up being the second, I think, MacArthur Fellow, which meant that he got $65,000 tax-free on top of his salary here when he joined the faculty.

25:03.386 --> 25:06.651
But at any rate, so he was part of it.

25:08.268 --> 25:12.971
So when we went back to the States, we didn't have any idea what to do, where to live.

25:13.454 --> 25:17.232
So Ann and I just moved to Denver, Pennsylvania because it was near Dick and his wife went back

25:17.600 --> 25:22.926
in the school system as a librarian or something so he could get some fringe benefits.

25:22.946 --> 25:25.469
And we used to dream and talk all the time about what we would do.

25:25.990 --> 25:31.716
So when we heard that we might go to the University of North Carolina, Wilmington, we drove down to actually look for houses to buy.

25:31.756 --> 25:33.959
I'm a South Carolinian by birth.

25:34.159 --> 25:41.768
My wife is a North Carolinian by birth, and we met in South Carolina, so the idea of moving to that part of the country had a certain appeal.

25:42.372 --> 25:55.364
But then the head of the anthropology department, with whom I was negotiating, said, we would like you to add a new world archaeologist to do the civil warships off of our own coast.

25:55.384 --> 25:59.728
So I gave that a little thought, and shortly thereafter, there was a national meeting of underwater archaeologists.

26:00.268 --> 26:01.309
I think it was in Charleston.

26:02.250 --> 26:05.713
And I thought to myself, who is the best underwater archaeologist in America?

26:06.994 --> 26:09.797
It's Carl Clausen, the state underwater archaeologist of Texas.

26:10.975 --> 26:15.821
who has just excavated or is excavating the 1554 fleet at Padre Island.

26:16.642 --> 26:25.012
So, as academics do, I went over to Carl and said how INA, or in those days it was AINA, the American Institute of Nautical Archaeology.

26:25.072 --> 26:27.875
We shortened it in later years.

26:30.078 --> 26:35.785
Because of the international nature of our work and the international funding we get, we just shortened the Institute of Nautical Archaeology.

26:35.950 --> 26:40.674
I said, do you know some young person that might like to join us to be our new oral archaeologist?

26:40.734 --> 26:44.438
Which was, I didn't want to insult him by saying, do you want to leave Texas?

26:44.478 --> 26:49.702
And I knew what might happen, what I hope would happen, and half an hour later he came over and said, hey, let's go have a coffee.

26:50.563 --> 26:52.124
And then we sat down and said, you know, I'd be interested.

26:52.164 --> 26:53.305
My wife is North Carolinian.

26:54.306 --> 27:00.412
And I've lived in Texas now, and it'd be nice to move back.

27:00.892 --> 27:03.054
And so that was it.

27:03.454 --> 27:04.135
It was all set.

27:07.034 --> 27:09.958
One day, Carl Clausen called and said, I have a friend.

27:09.998 --> 27:10.919
He was still living in Austin.

27:10.939 --> 27:12.741
He had a little, he called it his ranch.

27:12.761 --> 27:14.583
He had two cows outside of Austin.

27:15.504 --> 27:17.427
He said, I have a friend at Texas A&M.

27:18.008 --> 27:20.150
And to this day, I don't know who it was.

27:22.393 --> 27:23.334
It may have been Vaughn Bryant.

27:23.354 --> 27:23.715
I don't know.

27:24.496 --> 27:28.941
And why don't I get them to make a counteroffer so we're in a better bargaining position with the people of North Carolina?

27:30.119 --> 27:31.280
And so I said, that's fine.

27:31.741 --> 27:32.101
Why not?

27:32.902 --> 27:37.206
And he called, I don't know, a couple of weeks later and said, he was laughing, almost hysterically.

27:37.226 --> 27:39.489
He said, George, you better have your story straight.

27:40.409 --> 27:44.694
Because you're going to get a conference call in about a half an hour from a vice president and I think two deans.

27:45.555 --> 27:48.057
And they're going to ask you about coming to Texas A&M.

27:49.679 --> 27:52.822
And so half an hour later, I had a call.

27:53.543 --> 27:58.708
And I believe it was Vice President John Calhoun and probably Dean Maxwell.

27:59.954 --> 28:07.968
And in those days, we were first based in the College of Geosciences because they did not give a master's degree in anthropology yet.

28:08.569 --> 28:13.799
So it would have been the dean of geosciences whose name escapes me for the moment.

28:14.380 --> 28:15.442
That's me too right now.

28:15.462 --> 28:17.485
But I'll probably think of it.

28:17.525 --> 28:23.616
But at any rate, I remember the, you know, I can't imitate a Texas voice to this day, but it was harder.

28:23.596 --> 28:27.563
you know, Dr. Bass, are you really interested to come down and join us in College Station, Texas?

28:28.104 --> 28:33.113
And I said, well, it's certainly one of the many places we're considering.

28:33.133 --> 28:35.798
And they said, can you come down next week?

28:35.818 --> 28:37.300
They didn't know I was afraid to fly on an airplane.

28:38.082 --> 28:40.526
And I said, no, but I can come in February.

28:40.566 --> 28:43.151
I guess this is maybe December or November.

28:43.591 --> 28:48.540
And the reason for that is I was also going to go down to Florida because in the meantime we'd been offered

28:48.520 --> 28:55.168
a place at the Harbor Branch Foundation, which was said to have more money for undersea research than the U.S.

28:55.188 --> 28:56.449
Navy Office of Naval Research.

28:57.330 --> 29:00.013
So when the time came, I think it was February.

29:01.215 --> 29:01.855
Of 70.

29:02.536 --> 29:04.178
Oh, this would have been 60.

29:05.339 --> 29:06.100
No, it hadn't.

29:06.120 --> 29:07.922
Wait a minute, it would have been 60.

29:07.942 --> 29:09.404
No, it's got to be in the 70s with Calhoun.

29:09.424 --> 29:10.465
Oh, I'm sorry, 70s.

29:10.946 --> 29:18.274
It would have been, okay, the Cyprus War is in 74, so it would have been 75, the spring of February of 75.

29:18.254 --> 29:32.456
I took a train down to the Harbor Branch Foundation in Florida, and I already knew Ed Link, the inventor of the Link trainer, who was a pioneer in underwater archaeology, and then I met Seward Johnson of Johnson & Johnson, the air of Johnson & Johnson air.

29:33.178 --> 29:38.546
And they couldn't have been nicer and more gracious, and they offered me a building just as they had done.

29:38.967 --> 29:43.013
But I thought, well, this is not really – no, I was still thinking about it.

29:42.993 --> 29:54.231
So then I rented a car, still afraid to fly, in Orlando, no, wherever I was in Florida on the coast, and said, could I drop it off in Texas?

29:54.251 --> 30:09.675
And they found some heap that broke down on the way, and I got here, and I finally got to Texas A&M, and I met with John Calhoun, Jay Llewellyn, and his boss was...

30:10.162 --> 30:20.991
the head of the Research Foundation, Fred Benson, Dean Maxwell, and again it must have been the Dean of the College of Geosciences.

30:22.876 --> 30:24.019
Or Nerdy.

30:25.282 --> 30:26.904
He may have been there.

30:27.144 --> 30:32.450
I know that later he told me he played a role in bringing me, but I didn't remember, you know, that well.

30:32.530 --> 30:33.391
I didn't take any notes.

30:34.432 --> 30:41.299
But they didn't know, probably, how desperate we were because we still had a good reputation.

30:41.339 --> 30:43.601
We were digging with grants from the National Geographic Society.

30:44.582 --> 30:47.565
And I think, honestly, that they didn't realize exactly what we did.

30:48.266 --> 30:54.833
At that time, it was some archaeologists who were just starting to make money for their host institutes.

30:55.488 --> 31:04.280
by the new laws that meant before you could say drill for oil, you had to see that there was nothing there.

31:04.381 --> 31:08.126
And so there were people out in the Gulf riding around with magnetometers and sonar.

31:08.547 --> 31:15.977
I don't think they ever found a wreck, but they were paid great sums of money by the oil companies before they could drill to make sure they weren't going to put a drill in the middle of a shipwreck.

31:16.413 --> 31:20.006
And so I think that the whole idea will be part more of the geosciences.

31:20.628 --> 31:26.068
Somebody may even mention we might be in Galveston or we would like to be in Galveston.
