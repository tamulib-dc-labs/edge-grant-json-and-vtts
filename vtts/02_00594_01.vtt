00:02.495 --> 00:05.739
Today I'm interviewing Kathy Whitmire, mayor of 
the city of Houston. Today is November 11, 1983.

00:09.703 --> 00:10.424
First question. Kathy, do you feel that the people 
of Houston, with their oil-dealing,

00:11.746 --> 00:23.199
ranch-handed image of Houston, require a 
different strategy for you as a female candidate

00:11.746 --> 00:23.199
as opposed to, say, Jane Byrne of Chicago? Well, I 
think every city is different. The electorate in

00:26.383 --> 00:29.346
every city is different. tried to direct my 
campaigns at the attitudes that I think prevail

00:29.697 --> 00:38.988
with Houston's electorate, I'm sure that the ones 
in Chicago are very different. Attitudes, which

00:39.829 --> 00:42.972
ones prevail in Houston? Well, I've tried to 
direct my campaigns at the people in Houston who

00:42.992 --> 00:58.590
are generally younger and progressive and 
open-minded, and that's how I see Houston as a a

00:59.060 --> 01:06.873
city of relative newcomers with a relatively 
young average age. What groups would you say have

01:06.893 --> 01:11.039
posed more of a problem for you than, say, your male 
counterparts? Groups who have posed more of a

01:12.662 --> 01:19.012
problem for me than those same groups that have 
posed for males? Say, a male mayor. A male mayor. I

01:24.068 --> 01:24.628
don't know. I really don't make that much 
distinction between women and men candidates or

01:24.869 --> 01:33.136
elected officials. I think that it really depends 
on the individual. And groups such as the police

01:36.939 --> 01:48.729
union, who have been problematic in their 
dealings with me, have been equally problematic

01:36.939 --> 01:48.729
in their dealings with male mayors. And if I had 
different positions on the issues, they probably

01:48.889 --> 01:53.333
wouldn't I don't think the gender difference 
makes that much difference. Does the fact of you

01:58.025 --> 02:02.930
being a female allow you to detract or emphasize 
the real issues of a campaign? If so, does this

02:03.952 --> 02:09.538
enhance or hurt your posture, and how does it 
affect voter turnout? Well, when I first started

02:09.558 --> 02:18.628
running for office, the issue of being a female in a 
city that had never elected a woman to any office in

02:18.878 --> 02:33.274
some respects an advantage for me with the 
electorate because there were a lot of people who

02:18.878 --> 02:33.274
were interested in seeing a qualified female 
elected to a public office, and I think that did

02:18.878 --> 02:33.274
help the turnout, and it certainly helped recruit 
volunteers to my campaign. At the same time, it

02:33.694 --> 02:41.303
hurt fundraising for the campaign because there 
was a general view that women would not be

02:33.694 --> 02:41.303
successful. Did it allow you to detract or 
emphasize the real issues of the campaign, do you

02:43.125 --> 02:47.029
think? I think that there was initially some 
indication or some tendency for the media to focus

02:48.022 --> 03:02.119
more on my being female than on anything else, but 
ultimately we overcame that and I think ran a very

02:48.022 --> 03:02.119
issue-oriented campaign. In all three of the 
campaigns that I've run, I think they've been very

03:02.380 --> 03:05.724
issue-oriented. Does the media in any way detract 
the importance of the issue or ignore certain

03:06.645 --> 03:12.392
relevant responses you have towards them? And is 
there a difference, say, in the way the Houston

03:13.300 --> 03:18.928
Chronicle evaluates you as opposed to the Houston 
Post? Well, in any circumstance, the news media is

03:19.589 --> 03:25.198
going to put their own interpretation on the 
issues. That's just the nature of the situation.

03:31.507 --> 03:38.818
The Chronicle, unfortunately, has a tendency to 
use their news pages to carry out their

03:31.507 --> 03:38.818
editorials. position and they've done that in 
both of my campaigns and during my administration

03:39.102 --> 03:45.109
and I think that's unfortunate. The Post does not 
take editorial positions on elections and as a

03:45.530 --> 03:55.362
consequence they have more objective reporting. 
And yet still the Chronicle remains the main paper

03:57.104 --> 03:59.987
in Houston. What does that say? The Chronicle does 
have the largest distribution and I imagine that

04:00.668 --> 04:04.553
says that the people who are managing and editing 
the Chronicle and handling its distribution are

04:04.972 --> 04:15.842
doing a better job of their business, that is, 
providing a product which will sell. A campaign

04:17.103 --> 04:25.371
minority, say a black, Hispanic, or a gay, versus a 
female, which receives more notice in an election

04:17.103 --> 04:25.371
and why? Oh, I think it's probably about equal any 
time.

04:34.385 --> 04:39.951
A candidate is from some group that is not the 
traditional white male candidate. There's a lot

04:39.991 --> 04:41.712
of emphasis given to that. You may remember 
occasions when Catholics have run for president.

04:47.678 --> 04:52.723
There's been considerable attention given to a 
member of a religious minority, so to speak. So I

04:53.784 --> 04:55.967
think that there's not any real difference. 
That's just one of the ways that people focus on

04:55.987 --> 05:01.472
what's unique about this candidate, this 
candidate's a woman or is Jewish or is Catholic or

05:01.807 --> 05:05.572
is black or whatever. Obviously different 
communities value certain qualities. Would you

05:10.560 --> 05:19.272
explain Houston then and how you think they 
evaluate a female versus, how would you comprise

05:10.560 --> 05:19.272
Houston? Would you start at the beginning of that 
again? Evaluate certain qualities. How would you

05:24.780 --> 05:27.925
say Houston's in this respect then? Go back to what 
the respect is. I didn't... I didn't really

05:31.085 --> 05:33.147
understand what you started with. Different 
communities value certain qualities above

05:33.227 --> 05:36.130
others. Is it more important to be Mexican or be 
female? How would you look at Houston in this

05:42.517 --> 05:47.502
respect? I don't think those are the issues. I 
don't think that Houston, as a voting group,

05:49.445 --> 05:57.413
thinks it's more important to elect a member of any 
minority group versus any other or to elect

05:57.916 --> 06:01.560
someone who's not a member of a minority group. I 
think that Houston's, that Houstonians on the

06:01.921 --> 06:08.749
whole are looking for someone who is fiscal and 
conservative. I find that almost across the board

06:09.089 --> 06:18.260
that Houstonians want someone who will be 
responsible in their management of money and that

06:09.089 --> 06:18.260
that is a very, very high priority. And that 
Houstonians are looking for a candidate who

06:25.321 --> 06:30.368
appears to have the right qualifications and 
credentials for the job. Even when it comes to

06:30.388 --> 06:34.453
getting a black city council member as opposed to a 
white? Well, I think certainly the black

06:35.555 --> 06:53.218
community is interested in electing a black city 
council member, but I don't find at the same time

06:35.555 --> 06:53.218
that the white community is opposed to electing a 
black city council member. So I thought you were

06:54.278 --> 06:57.222
talking about the city as a whole. Does 
campaigning force you to become more female or

06:57.242 --> 07:05.733
more of a business person, sacrificing your 
sexuality from 9 to 5? No, I don't think

07:05.753 --> 07:08.236
campaigning forces you to do anything. Different 
women have taken different approaches to how to

07:08.296 --> 07:15.005
handle their gender in the campaign. I developed a 
certain approach that certainly was not a

07:16.567 --> 07:24.117
requirement and wouldn't be a requirement of 
anyone who happens to be a female candidate. The

07:24.502 --> 07:32.732
approach I took was that I was running for office 
initially in 1977 on my business background. And

07:32.852 --> 07:35.375
that was the basis of my campaign. And so I worked to 
present a business-like image to go with that

07:35.395 --> 07:39.861
business background. When you ran, it became an 
issue of how you dressed. Do you think, obviously,

07:44.807 --> 07:52.416
some men they dress what some people would term 
outdated. Do you find it surprising that you're

07:53.155 --> 07:59.942
given more attention than as opposed to how males 
dress? And what was your reaction to this as

08:00.022 --> 08:04.366
opposed to them focusing on the issues? Well, that 
is one of the differences of being a female

08:04.386 --> 08:15.597
candidate, that the press and the public at large 
focus more on appearance of females than they do on

08:04.386 --> 08:15.597
appearance of males, particularly on dress. 
There's just a tendency to focus more on dress of

08:15.778 --> 08:21.323
women in any in any profession or endeavor, not 
just in politics. If a female wore a mud sling, how

08:26.790 --> 08:34.598
would females view her as opposed to a male that 
females would see mud sling? Well, I find that the

08:36.140 --> 08:41.866
electorate in general does not appreciate mud 
sling, whether it's done by a male or a female. I

08:43.027 --> 08:47.412
don't know of any difference in whether A male 
candidate or a female candidate engages in

08:48.083 --> 08:54.029
mudslinging, I think in both cases it's generally 
disliked. You don't see a difference between a

08:54.049 --> 08:56.772
male being macho, brash? No, I think it's 
generally a bad campaign strategy and in most

08:57.553 --> 09:04.059
cases bad pers. Does a female, such as you, have to 
assert her views more defined and firmer due to how

09:05.060 --> 09:14.530
some females are viewed as being more 
persuadable? Yes, I think that's probably true. I

09:18.380 --> 09:31.758
think there's a tendency for people to assume that 
a woman is not going to be decisive and

09:18.380 --> 09:31.758
strong-willed, and I happen to be probably even 
more strong-willed than I should be. So I have to

09:32.258 --> 09:36.083
make sure that people are aware of that. How did 
this affect how you laid down your campaign

09:36.944 --> 09:41.771
promises, or did it? I don't think that it did. 
Explain how you feel the impact

09:45.813 --> 09:57.091
of the city having its first mayor affected its 
image. Having its first female mayor? Oh, I think

09:59.796 --> 10:05.425
that it certainly brought a degree of national 
attention to the city that we didn't have before.

10:05.962 --> 10:16.656
When you stop to think about the mayors of Houston 
in the past, if you would have asked someone in

10:05.962 --> 10:16.656
Chicago or Atlanta or Detroit who was the mayor of 
Houston, they probably wouldn't know. If you

10:16.676 --> 10:18.478
asked them today, they probably would know. So I 
think it brought some extra attention to the city

10:18.598 --> 10:21.802
that we didn't have before. Explain how your 
expectations meet up to the reality of being in

10:22.884 --> 10:28.551
office, differences and similarities. Well, the 
surprises that I found in taking office as

10:29.933 --> 10:34.939
mayor... had mostly to do with the extreme amount 
of attention that I get from the news media, which I

10:35.392 --> 10:55.676
really had not anticipated, and also with the 
unique situation of finding out what it's like for

10:35.392 --> 10:55.676
everyone to know who I am and finding that I have 
completely lost my privacy and that everywhere I

10:35.392 --> 10:55.676
go, everybody knows who I am. With regard to the 
management of the office, the only thing that's

10:56.036 --> 11:02.884
different from my expectation is that It really 
seems to take longer to get things done than I had

11:03.303 --> 11:19.406
hoped, because what I have found is that if you want 
to be successful in the arena of government, you

11:03.303 --> 11:19.406
have to check with everyone in advance before you 
do anything, so that everyone is well-informed,

11:03.303 --> 11:19.406
and it just takes longer than it should. Does the 
fact that you are female seem to make you more or

11:20.627 --> 11:29.119
less representative of establishment to such 
groups which might feel oppressed by a power of the

11:20.627 --> 11:29.119
elite? Say, how it... Yeah, I think I see what you 
mean. And obviously, since women have not

11:32.905 --> 11:47.065
traditionally been known as part of the power 
establishment, the fact that I'm a woman makes

11:32.905 --> 11:47.065
people who feel oppressed by that establishment 
relate to me more easily. How strategic was the

11:47.086 --> 11:56.479
appointment of the nationally credible black 
police chief, Captain Brown, and was it

11:47.086 --> 11:56.479
successful, and how would you gauge it such? Well, 
the appointment of Chief Brown was not a strategy

11:57.337 --> 12:01.463
that I planned in advance. That was a very 
fortunate incident. When I found myself in need of

12:05.128 --> 12:11.577
a new police chief very early on, I decided to have a 
national search done. I, at that time, certainly

12:11.917 --> 12:18.987
was not aware that there were any black police 
chiefs, so I did not set out to look for one by any

12:11.917 --> 12:18.987
means. And when we came down to the final 
candidates that seemed to have a lot of potential,

12:22.835 --> 12:34.870
it just so happened that one of them was Lee Brown, 
who happens to be black. And I think that in the long

12:34.910 --> 12:50.530
run that has proved to be a very, very good 
decision, probably much better than I ever could

12:34.910 --> 12:50.530
have anticipated due to his own personal 
abilities and qualities. It was not something

12:50.881 --> 12:52.963
that I had planned out in advance. I just set out to 
find someone who I had confidence in and who could

12:53.043 --> 12:59.070
make some reforms in the police department. And I 
was fortunate to find someone who I believe will be

12:59.090 --> 13:03.174
able to do that. For Police Chief Brown, you had 
eight police chiefs in eight years. The city did.

13:09.101 --> 13:09.682
The city did. Is that one of the criteria you would 
say that has helped you measure them by? Or how

13:15.548 --> 13:17.570
would you gauge its success? Would it be not being 
in the papers being a plus? I would gauge his

13:20.547 --> 13:27.617
success by being able to set some specific 
measurable goals and attain those goals. And by

13:28.419 --> 13:36.531
being able to gain the cooperation of people in the 
department who initially didn't have any

13:28.419 --> 13:36.531
intention of cooperating with him. By being able 
to go from a time when members of council and

13:37.092 --> 13:48.208
members of the employee organizations openly 
said that they opposed his appointment to the time

13:37.092 --> 13:48.208
now. where all of those people openly say that they 
agree with his department and that they support

13:48.593 --> 13:55.627
his leadership. Do you think that being a female 
makes it easier or harder for you to gain

13:55.647 --> 14:02.120
credibility with the police department? 
Probably harder. Why? Because females have only

14:04.405 --> 14:08.172
recently been allowed in the police department 
and most current members of the department were

14:08.523 --> 14:21.277
there at the time when they felt that women were 
unqualified to do the kind of work they're doing,

14:08.523 --> 14:21.277
and so it's easy for them to wonder whether women 
are qualified to do the kind of work I'm doing. Do

14:22.459 --> 14:25.883
you think that the council deals with a female 
differently than a male? On June 15th, 1983, there

14:27.685 --> 14:30.548
was put some term to riot, police department, 
small. You mean in the council chambers? In the

14:35.785 --> 14:39.890
council chambers where a few hundred came inside 
were screaming obscenities. It seemed that

14:40.651 --> 14:43.354
council really didn't support you. At least the 
appearance was. Do you think if you'd have been a

14:45.797 --> 14:51.283
male mayor, council would have handled the 
situation a few differently? I don't think so at

14:51.303 --> 14:52.264
all. I think every council member had their own 
view of that situation and most of them are more

14:58.490 --> 15:01.253
tolerant of disorderliness than I am. There was a 
city ordinance requiring only a certain number of

15:03.016 --> 15:08.923
people to be allowed in there and it was violated. 
Why wasn't it able to be enforced? Because most

15:13.669 --> 15:19.536
members of council are more tolerant of 
disorderliness and believe it should not be

15:13.669 --> 15:19.536
enforced. Even if it includes people screaming 
obscenities at the mayor of the city of Houston?

15:26.004 --> 15:26.505
Apparently so. Do you think that the males of the 
city and on city council have something against

15:27.616 --> 15:36.224
looking up to you or working under you as a female? 
And how did you feel working under Jim O'Connor as a

15:36.244 --> 15:39.728
female male? I don't think that that made any 
difference. Business? Yeah, it was just a

15:44.993 --> 15:46.774
business relationship. There's the fact that in 
1977, it was the International Woman's Year and

15:48.556 --> 15:54.822
they had their convention in Houston. Do you think 
that that affects the use in Houston is how they

15:55.392 --> 16:00.005
look at a female mayor? I'd say in Dallas, you used 
to look at a female mayor if they had one? Probably

16:04.457 --> 16:06.101
not. That was just one event on one weekend, and I 
think most people in Houston have probably

16:06.241 --> 16:11.275
forgotten about it by now. Do you feel the gay 
community having a feminist posture, or at least a

16:12.352 --> 16:30.950
feminist image in the eyes of society, is more 
responsive to your policies, and do you feel that

16:12.352 --> 16:30.950
you are more sympathetic, if not at least more 
willing to listen to them, than a male who has to fit

16:12.352 --> 16:30.950
the image of going against them to protect 
himself? Not at all. I know many male politicians

16:32.711 --> 16:38.477
who get along well with the gay community, and I 
also know many men in the gay community who just

16:38.896 --> 16:42.981
simply don't like women at all. What are the 
special interest groups or, say, supporters that

16:45.664 --> 16:51.890
would influence your politics, your policies? I 
don't think special interest groups influence my

16:53.773 --> 16:56.476
policies. Cameron Ironwork had to laugh between 
2,000 and 2,500 workers. International Tool

17:03.143 --> 17:07.688
Supply, out of 500 workers, had to laugh about 70%. 
When you were mayor, you had to lay off less than 50

17:08.714 --> 17:13.198
of the city's workers. Until the summer of 1982, 
Houston's employment had been almost sheltered

17:14.019 --> 17:23.869
until it caught up with the United States being 
about 4% less originally. When this caught up with

17:25.591 --> 17:29.515
Houston, did the city apportion you with an undue 
amount of criticism? Oh, I don't think so.

17:33.479 --> 17:36.882
Certainly my opponent in this last election took 
advantage of the economic recession as something

17:37.452 --> 17:42.897
to lay at my doorstep. And I think that any opponent 
would have done that. That's part of running a

17:45.780 --> 17:48.983
political campaign. You blame your opposition 
with whatever you can. But I do not feel that I've

17:53.487 --> 17:59.673
been unduly blamed for the national economic 
recession. Do you think Houston's image has

18:00.814 --> 18:05.198
strengthened among mayors and governors of the 
United States? with a female as opposed to if a male

18:05.633 --> 18:09.056
had accomplished the same results? Well I think I 
certainly have a higher profile amongst mayors

18:10.477 --> 18:31.596
and governors of the United States because I'm a 
woman and I also have made it my business to take an

18:10.477 --> 18:31.596
active part in national organizations of elected 
officials and therefore I've become well known by

18:10.477 --> 18:31.596
the other mayors around the country. How could the 
administration be so out of touch with the voters

18:34.793 --> 18:44.809
when it came to the vote on the Metropolitan 
Transit Authority bonds, especially when our

18:34.793 --> 18:44.809
congressman in DC was even so surprised at the 
city's action when everyone knew it would be

18:34.793 --> 18:44.809
defeated. Well, I don't know whether everyone 
knew it would be defeated. I still think that there

18:48.815 --> 19:02.016
was a strategic mistake made in calling that 
election at a time when only a few people would be

18:48.815 --> 19:02.016
voting because I think that the majority of the 
voters, The majority of the voters had been in the

19:02.182 --> 19:04.726
polls that we passed. It was the low turnout that 
caused it to be defeated. So you're saying that you

19:08.592 --> 19:14.220
were in touch with the voters, it's just the ones 
that you were in touch with didn't show up? Yeah, I

19:14.781 --> 19:16.103
think that's true. A very small percentage of the 
people voted, and they all came from a very

19:16.163 --> 19:23.635
specific segment of the city. They were all older 
voters, older and affluent voters. And if there

19:28.760 --> 19:35.450
had been a large turnout, such as the turnout that 
voted this week in the mayor's race, I think it

19:28.760 --> 19:35.450
probably would have passed. Will the same vote be 
taken to the people again? Not the same, no.

19:39.397 --> 19:40.959
Similar? What's going to be done is the various 
alternatives for public transportation systems

19:40.979 --> 19:53.839
are going to be reviewed in community meetings 
around the city to try to get an advanced view of

19:40.979 --> 19:53.839
what kind of support there is for the various 
alternatives. San Francisco recently passed an

19:54.427 --> 20:02.659
ordinance which forbid any smoking in offices, 
restaurants, and all public facilities. San

20:03.920 --> 20:06.704
Francisco also has a female mayor, Mayor 
Feinstein. Do you think you could pass the same

20:08.527 --> 20:15.316
sort of legislation in Houston that would, being a 
female, have any difference in if you tried to pass

20:08.527 --> 20:15.316
it as a male? No, I don't think there's any 
difference in a male or a female advocating for

20:16.097 --> 20:21.425
that particular legislation. I haven't really 
reviewed it, so I don't know whether I would want to

20:23.485 --> 20:26.249
pass that particular legislation.

20:31.575 --> 20:40.247
With respect to your relationships with city 
council, do you feel like you're treated as a

20:31.575 --> 20:40.247
gentlewoman or as just another one of the guys on 
city council? And what would your preference be?

20:43.511 --> 20:47.556
I'm treated as another one of the guys, and that is 
my preference. Do different factions of media,

20:47.576 --> 20:53.003
say papers as opposed to radio, Do different 
factions measure you differently? Oh, not

20:58.180 --> 20:59.362
intentionally. I think each type of media has a 
different approach. The newspapers, the

21:03.628 --> 21:14.522
reporters for the newspapers are always much 
better informed and get involved in the specifics

21:03.628 --> 21:14.522
of the issues much more than the broadcast media. 
The television people are generally looking for

21:14.902 --> 21:22.112
something that's sensational, and that just 
relates to what their audiences want. What are the

21:23.695 --> 21:34.370
advantages and disadvantages a female office 
holder deals with when it comes to getting the job

21:23.695 --> 21:34.370
done that you can attribute to being, that you can 
attribute to sexual honor? There are really not

21:35.111 --> 21:36.594
any. I'm not a big believer that either men or women 
are automatically more qualified to do

21:36.614 --> 21:45.226
something. I think that every person is an 
individual and has to be considered as such. Well,

21:49.512 --> 21:53.618
they might not be more qualified, but do you think 
that there still are any things that hold you back

21:54.121 --> 21:59.349
in certain areas that, despite qualifications, 
you're not able to achieve? No. Do you think that we

22:01.472 --> 22:10.206
as a nation are past the point where we examine 
females in public to see whether we should move

22:01.472 --> 22:10.206
from the testing point and allow it to not hinge on 
gender anymore? No, I don't think we're to that

22:11.929 --> 22:14.713
point yet. I think that there's still a small 
enough number of women officials that people like

22:18.775 --> 22:31.730
me still do get an inordinate amount of public 
attention because we serve as a role model or an

22:18.775 --> 22:31.730
example of what women are like in public office. Do 
you think we'll ever have a female president?

22:34.913 --> 22:35.314
Certainly. How soon? I don't know. No guesses? No. 
All things happen eventually. You went to school

22:43.480 --> 22:48.849
in the Houston Independent School District, 
HISD. You went to San Jacinto High School. What is

22:50.792 --> 22:55.519
your feeling then and what is your feeling now on 
the quality of the education? Well, I think I got a

22:56.180 --> 22:58.524
good education in HISD. I knew at the time that 
there were some differences in the level of

22:59.185 --> 23:10.163
educational opportunity that was provided at 
different schools. When I graduated from high

23:10.531 --> 23:19.888
school, generally, Bel Air High School was 
thought to be the most advanced, and their

23:10.531 --> 23:19.888
students had the opportunity to take the most 
advanced courses. San Jacinto was not really in

23:20.429 --> 23:29.226
the same league with Bel Air, but at the same time, I 
felt I had the opportunity to get a good education

23:20.429 --> 23:29.226
there. I'm sure there are still those 
differences. I saw that in the late 60s and early

23:32.553 --> 23:42.188
70s, there was a lot of decline in the quality of 
education in HISD and specifically in the quality

23:32.553 --> 23:42.188
of discipline. And I think that in the last 10 
years, we have seen some improvements. We've seen

23:45.834 --> 23:54.468
some improvements in the type of opportunities 
that are provided through the magnet program and

23:45.834 --> 23:54.468
through the VANDVARD program. And we're 
beginning to see some improvements in the

23:55.209 --> 23:59.235
discipline, which I think is very important.

24:02.523 --> 24:09.572
Administrators have typically been males while 
the teachers of America's grade schools have

24:02.523 --> 24:09.572
typically been females. How has HSD's weak image 
affected your dealings with the administration

24:11.655 --> 24:15.941
of this system? Well, I really don't have a lot of 
dealings with the administration of the school

24:18.304 --> 24:30.420
system since they are an independent school 
district and not subject to any policy

24:18.304 --> 24:30.420
determinations from the city.

24:30.839 --> 24:38.728
Does being a woman help bolster public opinion in 
your favor when you at least say your feelings

24:30.839 --> 24:38.728
towards education? I really don't take public 
positions on education very often since it's not

24:39.849 --> 24:49.259
within the realm of responsibilities that the 
city has. Governor White has a strong stance on

24:49.920 --> 24:52.283
education. Have you had any dealings with 
Governor White on this issue? I have had a lot of

24:56.236 --> 24:59.299
dealings with Governor White, mostly on other 
issues. I have talked with him about his views on

24:59.399 --> 25:08.789
education and certainly respect his views as a 
strong supporter of education. What are your

25:09.489 --> 25:10.170
views? I think that the public school system is one 
of the most important aspects of what a city offers

25:11.651 --> 25:24.785
to its citizens and that it is extremely important 
to be able to provide a quality education for the

25:11.651 --> 25:24.785
public school system. Have we achieved that 
quality? I think there is still room for

25:26.375 --> 25:41.674
improvement, and I think that while Governor 
White is working actively to improve pay scales

25:26.375 --> 25:41.674
for teachers, that there are two things that are 
going to have to be done to ultimately attract the

25:26.375 --> 25:41.674
kind of quality people that we need and retain them 
in education. One of those is that we're going to

25:42.155 --> 25:52.668
have to have year-round school, because you can't 
expect someone to make a living on a nine-month

25:42.155 --> 25:52.668
salary, and you can't expect them to earn a 
12-month salary if they only work nine months. So

25:53.028 --> 25:55.251
that's one thing that's going to have to change. 
And the other thing that's going to have to change

25:55.568 --> 26:01.136
is that teachers are going to have to be 
compensated according to merit. They can't just

26:01.356 --> 26:05.582
be compensated across the board and expect to 
retain big performers. Do you believe in paying

26:07.284 --> 26:12.772
teachers according to ability or according to 
years? According to ability. Do you think that

26:15.075 --> 26:17.578
that will be possible in HISD? I certainly hope so. 
And once again, that's not one of the things that

26:19.101 --> 26:23.787
comes under the jurisdiction of the city. So what 
I'm offering is just my personal opinion. Do you

26:27.679 --> 26:37.412
feel that women are more comprehensible or are 
more sympathetic towards education since they

26:27.679 --> 26:37.412
have the image of being the teachers of our nation? 
Well, that's certainly conventional wisdom,

26:38.754 --> 26:44.621
that women are more interested in education. On 
the other hand, I find that many business people

26:45.202 --> 26:52.491
are extremely aware of the importance of quality 
education, and many businessmen are aware of

26:52.842 --> 26:55.666
that. Houston has traditionally, at least in the 
eyes of the public, had a poor school system by

26:57.308 --> 27:03.235
national standards. It was nationally ranked 
18th out of the 22 largest metropolitan cities,

27:03.315 --> 27:17.073
and it's ranked in the top five, with Dallas being 
second in the segregation of the school district.

27:17.434 --> 27:20.858
What sort of long-term goals do you think should be 
set for HISD And how do you think the strength and

27:21.563 --> 27:27.694
quality of the Spring Branch Independent School 
District fits into a picture like this? Well, of

27:29.036 --> 27:35.688
course, both the Spring Branch School District 
and the Houston Independent School District, as

27:29.036 --> 27:35.688
well as a couple of others, are included within the 
City of Houston. And my hope is that all of those

27:35.948 --> 27:46.407
school districts can set some very high standards 
for the type of educational opportunity that is

27:35.948 --> 27:46.407
provided for young people growing up in Houston 
because I think that public education is just

27:46.808 --> 27:59.500
extremely important and that a higher emphasis 
needs to be placed on educational achievement

27:46.808 --> 27:59.500
than we have seen perhaps in the past. What do you 
think has allowed Spring Branch Independent

28:00.581 --> 28:06.707
School District to obviously surpass a quality 
education in HISD? I'm not really aware that it has

28:07.327 --> 28:12.652
surpassed HISD. Perhaps it has, I'm just not 
informed. Do you think it's all in the games of

28:15.344 --> 28:17.707
economics? Well, I really couldn't comment on it 
since I don't necessarily know that the premise is

28:17.727 --> 28:21.972
true. Explain your relationship with Billy 
Reagan and how you evaluate him in his job. Well, my

28:29.000 --> 28:33.165
relationship with Billy Reagan is a good one. We 
have a good working relationship on the issues

28:33.205 --> 28:37.831
that we have in common. The city has some 
contractual relationships with the school

28:38.472 --> 28:41.976
district. for the collection of taxes and the 
appraisal of tax property, and we do work together

28:42.563 --> 28:52.136
from the standpoint of planning our tax 
situation. We also have a few other programs that

28:52.557 --> 29:03.192
we've worked on jointly with regard to 
after-school programs in cooperation with our

28:52.557 --> 29:03.192
Parks Department and the Houston Independent 
School District. I think that during the years

29:03.212 --> 29:07.778
that Billy Reagan has been with the Houston 
Independent School District, he has

29:08.045 --> 29:13.212
accomplished some significant improvements in 
the programming and in the quality of education.

29:13.412 --> 29:14.935
And I'm generally a supporter of his. Do you think 
he's coming towards the end of his ability to

29:16.617 --> 29:23.386
justify his existence in the school system? Or do 
you think that he has a lot more to offer? I think he

29:26.130 --> 29:30.095
has more to offer.

29:30.536 --> 29:34.862
On June 15, 1983, you had an incident with the 
police department. The Houston Police

29:35.787 --> 29:39.672
Department is the second highest paid in the 
nation behind Los Angeles. But in real terms, LA

29:40.353 --> 29:42.957
has a higher cost of living. And so Houston's the 
highest paid police department. They seem to put

29:48.604 --> 29:53.130
out an image of being rednecks and providing low 
quality service. And the city's very aware of this

29:54.132 --> 29:57.316
image. Do you think that this image, do you think 
that the frustration that they feel, do you think

29:59.298 --> 30:05.727
that that was shown in the council meeting, would 
you like to explain why you think the

30:06.027 --> 30:09.571
circumstances came to be? I don't think the 
incident in the council meeting has anything to do

30:10.932 --> 30:14.256
with their image. I think it had entirely to do with 
the union leaders who were unable to get

30:14.877 --> 30:28.792
acquiescence from this administration for their 
financial demands, both in terms of pay and

30:14.877 --> 30:28.792
benefits. And that's really what it was about. 
Now, on the subject of HPD's image. They have had a

30:34.897 --> 30:41.286
bad national image in the past, but I think since 
Chief Brown has been here, we have seen some

30:34.897 --> 30:41.286
improvement in that image. We've seen some 
improvement in the professional standards in the

30:41.306 --> 30:46.574
department, and I'm looking forward to more 
improvements in the future. Being in real terms

30:47.375 --> 30:52.243
the highest paid department in the nation, were 
their demands justified? No. Why not? Because of

30:54.186 --> 30:59.153
what you just explained, that they already are the 
highest paid in the nation, and Obviously, I think

30:59.521 --> 31:08.042
we all understand that the job of a union leader 
under any circumstance is to go out and fight for

30:59.521 --> 31:08.042
higher pay and higher benefits, no matter how high 
they already are. And those union leaders were

31:08.583 --> 31:11.691
trying to do their job in their regard.
