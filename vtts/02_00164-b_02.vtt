WEBVTT

00:02.883 --> 00:06.186
The Navy Marine Corps winning the Corps. We had to 
make not only office space available to them, but

00:06.407 --> 00:20.200
decide which of the Corps outfits would be 
oriented as a Navy Marine outfit as opposed to Army

00:06.407 --> 00:20.200
and Air Force. And I had been thinking about it and 
trying to pull it out, Don Johnson and I. And

00:26.306 --> 00:29.970
anyway, I put on the list E-2 to the Navy Marines. 
And I'll have to admit to this day, I would have

00:30.743 --> 00:36.916
never in my life done that if somebody had said, 
hey, that's Reveille outfit. It never crossed my

00:37.116 --> 00:42.167
mind because I would have never given Reveille to 
anybody but an Army unit. I had that much Army in my

00:42.187 --> 00:44.411
blood. So I gave the Navy Marines Reveille. And 
there she sits. With what company had Reveley been

00:51.753 --> 00:54.737
before that? It wasn't E2. Oh, so it was the 
designation of E2. I just designated E2 would be

00:57.600 --> 01:02.887
one of the companies that they can take 
responsibility for. And, you know, it still had

01:03.447 --> 01:06.391
Army and Air Force. We were all mismatched up. If a 
cadet wanted to be in an Army-oriented outfit, it

01:09.014 --> 01:15.822
didn't matter whether he had a contract or he was in 
Air Force or whatever. So they could go to any

01:16.083 --> 01:20.528
outfit they wanted to, and we didn't tell them they 
had to be in that program. Alright, as the Navy and

01:21.149 --> 01:32.447
Marine Corps began here, General Simpson soon 
came, were there then some Navy and Marine Corps

01:21.149 --> 01:32.447
officers also detached, assigned here? Oh yeah, 
they opened up a big detachment there, Colonel

01:40.876 --> 01:43.819
He just passed away over in the grad school. We'll 
think of it later. Who were the, how easy was it for

01:47.123 --> 01:54.592
the rest of the Corps to accept this addition? The 
Corps didn't have any problem with it. Is that

01:56.274 --> 01:57.795
right? Yeah. So that went well. Yeah, they were 
just happy to say, you know, more. The Marines, the

02:02.461 --> 02:06.225
Navy Marines program, they brought in a heck of a 
lot of, scholarship signals from, you know, and

02:06.847 --> 02:11.973
they'd take them all over the United States and 
they'd tell them where to go. And they brought them

02:12.894 --> 02:14.275
in here. So there were no problems with that at all? 
No, not with the Corps. It was totally a service

02:19.141 --> 02:24.226
oriented thing of protecting your service sort of 
stuff. Now, and when you arrived, were there

02:24.987 --> 02:28.371
already some black Corps members? I don't think 
so. I don't remember any. Alright, during your

02:31.737 --> 02:35.381
years, there were some black members of the Corps. 
There were one or two showing up. There were not

02:37.244 --> 02:38.045
many. Did you ever encounter any hazing problems 
related to race? Were there any problems in the

02:44.552 --> 02:46.455
Corps? I didn't know anything that was, you know, 
nobody saying, you dirty Mexican or anything.

02:52.162 --> 02:52.442
Never. I've never heard of any. Never. Everybody, 
if you're in the Corps, you're a Corps. And it's

02:58.630 --> 02:59.871
still that way now. Women in the Corps and men in the 
Corps, there was a lot of problems with that. But I

03:06.028 --> 03:13.215
still think most of them accept it and agree with it 
and it seems to me that they're treated pretty

03:06.028 --> 03:13.215
good. All right. While you were Commandant, were 
there women in the Corps? That's me again. I was,

03:18.800 --> 03:20.581
yes, I was. Please describe. I was pressured the 
year before we started the program by the Army. And

03:28.808 --> 03:36.856
Crossland was being pressured by the Air Force 
saying, we want women in the program, in the ROTC.

03:37.657 --> 03:39.219
You can have them in the ROTC. They don't have to be 
in the Corps. Well, we don't want anybody in the

03:40.520 --> 03:43.363
ROTC who wasn't in the Corps. Well, the Army called 
me one day and said, great news for you. You're

03:49.710 --> 03:53.994
going to be the test unit in the Fourth Army for 
women. And we're going to start you out this fall.

03:56.637 --> 03:57.718
And I said, no, sir. We're not going to start now 
this fall. The university has not accepted that

03:59.816 --> 04:02.580
program. And so they went to San Antonio to... St. 
Mary's? No, the Trinity. Trinity? And that's

04:13.396 --> 04:16.000
where they were the first in the state of Texas. So I 
called, I talked to Dr. Williams too about this.

04:22.109 --> 04:25.073
And Dr. Williams and I met one day and he says, You 
know, the pressure is on everybody on this thing,

04:25.559 --> 04:32.885
and I know it's on you, and they said, I think it's 
time we took the move, don't you? And I said, yes,

04:32.925 --> 04:35.708
sir. It's getting real tough for the Army for me. I 
mean, they were really putting the screws on me,

04:38.650 --> 04:43.134
and they were in a position to do it. And so were the 
former students, but we took a big hassle from

04:43.975 --> 04:54.064
former students, and I had many of my classmates 
call me and were not too happy with me. What was

04:54.635 --> 04:58.259
their basic argument against? They just didn't 
want women in the Corps. What do they think would

05:00.322 --> 05:01.583
be? I don't think there was any logic to it 
whatsoever. Even with the guys in the Corps at that

05:06.630 --> 05:16.862
time, they didn't want those females over there, 
although they all had girlfriends and this, that,

05:06.630 --> 05:16.862
and the other. You know, they hadn't recognized 
that women played a big part in it. And they were

05:20.849 --> 05:26.761
playing a big part in the military when I was, you 
know, on active duty elsewhere. And they did a lot

05:27.643 --> 05:29.086
of jobs. They did well and better than the men. But 
it was not an easy task, so that was one of the real

05:31.439 --> 05:39.071
problems I was working with. When did the women 
first enter the Corps, do you remember?

05:42.918 --> 05:43.559
Seventy-two. Seventy-two. And about how many 
were there that year? About thirty. And Ruth Ann

05:49.528 --> 05:53.895
Schumacher was the first to become a company. The 
first year they had a male company commander. Ruth

05:56.760 --> 05:58.543
Ann was the first. female commander and did a 
marvelous job. Her brother was in the Corps, and

06:02.933 --> 06:17.535
her father was a colonel, and she went in the 
service, so she was the first female officer

06:02.933 --> 06:17.535
commissioned into the regular Army through an 
ROTC program. Nationally? In a military program.

06:22.342 --> 06:22.843
Nationally. I'm sorry? You're saying 
nationally, not just for A&M, but nationally. Oh,

06:26.822 --> 06:28.304
right. We did it before West Point, VMI, I said it. 
We were the first military school to integrate

06:31.008 --> 06:35.473
women. What were some of the problems that you, as 
the Commandant, had to cope with about women in the

06:36.154 --> 06:42.622
Corps? Well, it was mostly with my former 
students. I didn't have too much trouble with the

06:46.047 --> 06:47.569
Corps. They didn't like it. But I flat-told them, 
this is going to happen. And I want to know from you

06:53.165 --> 06:58.211
how you give me a plan of integration, which I did. 
They called it the Miranda Plan. And they got us a

07:00.914 --> 07:02.355
war. They did a whole lot better job than I could 
have done. And, of course, we were struggling

07:07.180 --> 07:11.245
around figuring out how we were going to do this, 
that, and the other. But most of the guidance came

07:11.285 --> 07:15.269
from the core of how they would do it. And I 
disagreed with some of them. For example, they

07:17.912 --> 07:23.138
said there would never be in pinks and greens. 
Never be in boots. I said, well, we're not talking

07:25.191 --> 07:28.420
that now, and so forth. Well, anyway, we got it 
going in the first year they didn't have uniforms.

07:33.533 --> 07:39.388
They didn't have them because we didn't know how 
many we were going to have, and one thing or

07:33.533 --> 07:39.388
another, this was a, believe me, it was a big 
problem. But we got around that thing and the

07:40.111 --> 07:47.404
girls, one of them came over to me one day and said, 
we need some recognition. Said, could we at least

07:47.424 --> 07:49.368
have name tags? And I said, you bet. I'll have them 
tomorrow and give me a list. And so we got those. And

07:55.419 --> 07:58.364
so that was the only identification they had. And 
they didn't live in the dorm that year because we

07:58.384 --> 08:02.271
didn't know how many dorm spaces. But they had to 
come out and do the breakfast mccall and all that

08:02.960 --> 08:06.926
stuff. But the second year is when we went into the 
uniform business. And the girls themselves

08:13.757 --> 08:17.363
pretty much designed, they wanted to do the A-line 
skirts. And I didn't know what an A-line from a

08:17.403 --> 08:21.630
B-line was and all that sort of stuff. And the 
people over at the warehouse over there did a

08:21.650 --> 08:27.820
fantastic job.

08:28.998 --> 08:34.103
They had their own company that second year? They 
had, they were still, the entire time I was there,

08:34.123 --> 08:43.573
they were not integrated into the W-1, and we 
selected that W for women. And it was Army? Well,

08:47.217 --> 08:49.039
Army was supervised. But it was, they could be in 
any branch, any of the three branches? Oh yes, any

08:52.623 --> 08:55.866
ROTC program they wanted to be in. And they were 
pretty well evened out, Army and Air Force, later

08:56.437 --> 09:00.862
on Navy. But we did put them over in the dorm too. And 
we got the university to renovate it to put in

09:06.568 --> 09:11.234
privacy stalls. And strangely enough, they 
didn't like that. Took the urinals out and all

09:14.598 --> 09:16.199
that. That baffled me. I'd have liked to have them 
when I was a cadet to have a little privacy. They

09:21.205 --> 09:23.428
wanted the same thing as the guys did. And after I 
left, they moved them in their regular dormitory.

09:26.390 --> 09:29.274
But, you know, it's hard to understand for me. But 
anyway, after their second year, it's coming up

09:30.075 --> 09:36.865
time to be pinks and greens. Well, of course, they 
have no pinks and greens. Well, Nancy Hart, who I

09:39.649 --> 09:46.178
commissioned later, came in that summer and we 
talked about it. And I said, Nancy, you got a lot of

09:46.198 --> 09:50.023
gumption, I think. And she said, yes, sir. And I 
said, well, we're going to put you in green shirt

09:56.883 --> 09:58.846
and pink skirt. And, uh, can you handle it? She 
said, oh, yes, sir, you bet. And she showed up in

10:04.036 --> 10:07.421
that thing and there was some hassle, but it was 
accepted. And that's, uh, that was the start of

10:08.243 --> 10:11.428
giving them those privileges. Uh, I never 
considered boats, uh, and I don't like them now. I

10:15.616 --> 10:19.142
just don't think it looks good, but that's, 
there'll be no small. But, uh, anyway, the, uh, The

10:22.482 --> 10:30.216
clothing people, they really did a fantastic job 
because we had no idea, and I certainly had none.

10:30.256 --> 10:38.632
And I had a real problem looking after the girls 
because I couldn't really go into the dorms. And I

10:38.652 --> 10:45.064
guess some of the male guys did, I don't know, but I 
would never go in without a female accompanying

10:38.652 --> 10:45.064
me. But I told the Army, I said, okay, you want me to 
do this program, you get me a woman officer. And

10:51.704 --> 10:55.148
they had a tough time getting me one and it hurt me, 
but they did. I got one pretty fast, a young

10:55.248 --> 10:58.771
lieutenant named Holtzman. What? 
H-O-L-T-Z-M-A-N, Teresa Holtzman. Teresa

11:02.675 --> 11:03.296
Holtzman. She was a Yankee girl, went to college in 
the North and talked like one. and she was just as

11:10.795 --> 11:36.043
sweet as she could be, and I'm not saying that in a 
male-female situation, but she really worked

11:10.795 --> 11:36.043
with those gals, and she brought them a long way, 
and I think they cared a lot about her, and she just

11:10.795 --> 11:36.043
did a fabulous job, and maybe later on brought one 
in too, but boy, we needed them bad, and they'd come

11:10.795 --> 11:36.043
to me with the, or this A-line skirt on it, and they 
were wearing these short things anyway, and one of

11:36.597 --> 11:54.243
them come in one day in my office, they'd come in a 
lot of times to talk, and sitting there, I finally

11:36.597 --> 11:54.243
just had to say, I know her name, I'd say, look, I 
don't want to see the color of your underwear.

11:54.824 --> 11:57.087
Would you please pull your skirt down? Now, that's 
pretty embarrassing to have to do, and we laughed

11:57.327 --> 12:04.798
about it later, and I did, but I didn't want to 
embarrass her, but But anyway, Theresa was able to

12:05.453 --> 12:10.701
do the little things, but they were big things for 
me. It was hard for a man to handle. What kind of

12:16.150 --> 12:20.156
pranks did the male corps members attempt on the 
females? They gave them a lot of hassle. I don't

12:23.080 --> 12:33.857
know everything, but I do know I got a call one time 
that the company C2, who were then at that time in

12:23.080 --> 12:33.857
Dorm 3, was mooning the girls over in dorm two, and 
they were mooning them back. And I had to get into

12:39.094 --> 12:44.341
the moon fight, but that was pretty easy to settle. 
In the dining halls, when they'd have a food fight,

12:45.502 --> 12:51.791
did they ever throw stuff at the girls? I'm not 
aware of any of that. I'm not even aware of food

12:54.414 --> 12:58.139
fights in the dining hall where I had to knock it at 
girls. Oh, really? Oh, OK. I don't know whether I

12:59.801 --> 13:01.783
had them or not. Good. And out on the drill field, 
did they ever do anything to harass the females?

13:11.291 --> 13:13.994
Not to my knowledge, but I'm sure they gave them a 
hard time. I mean, as long as they were in a room

13:14.074 --> 13:21.302
unit, they leaned on each other. And I did not 
integrate them into the male units, so that was

13:21.322 --> 13:30.051
done after my time.

13:30.757 --> 13:32.779
I was not named in the lawsuit either. I don't know 
why, but maybe because I was the one that was trying

13:32.820 --> 13:38.466
to push a program. And poor old Jim Woodall got the 
hassle of it because that was the time I retired.

13:47.017 --> 13:55.988
But I got along with them well, and my wife and I 
attended their out-of-date functions when they

13:47.017 --> 13:55.988
invited us. And they were living in, most of them in 
one of these dorm complexes off campus. And they

14:03.508 --> 14:06.351
had a party over there one time and I went to it. They 
asked my wife, would the colonel get real mad if we

14:06.972 --> 14:12.578
took him to the quad in the swimming pool? And she 
said, no, if you just tell him so he can get his boots

14:13.499 --> 14:18.604
off and all that stuff. So they carried me and 
dumped me in there. The girls did? Yes. And they did

14:23.626 --> 14:32.462
the same thing the guys do, because on the way to 
that swimming pool, after I got out, I told my wife

14:23.626 --> 14:32.462
they can take me again, because they unzipped my 
pants and somebody reached in. I said, let them

14:34.807 --> 14:36.229
take me again. And she said, what part? She said, no 
way. So they got the spirit pretty fast, I guess. I

14:44.585 --> 14:45.887
don't know who it was. I communicate with two or 
three of them. Robin Gibson, General Gibson was

14:52.409 --> 14:56.675
her father. He was an Ivy II star then. Now she's 
married to one of the guys who was on the Corps

14:58.718 --> 15:04.727
staff. She's a lieutenant colonel in the reserve 
now. She's sitting on after duty as well. Her

15:11.396 --> 15:16.583
husband is going to become a general pretty soon, I 
think, pretty quickly. She was a big talker. She

15:19.803 --> 15:21.949
was just an inspiration. Looking back on 
coeducation in the Corps, what did we do well and

15:22.690 --> 15:33.458
what could we have done better?

15:35.024 --> 15:42.095
I don't know how we would have gotten it done 
easier.

15:44.018 --> 15:49.586
It would have been better, I suppose, if we'd had a 
female officer in the beginning. It took several

15:49.867 --> 16:00.223
months to get one down here, a female active 
officer, because the Corps males, you know, would

15:49.867 --> 16:00.223
quote the commander and this, that, and the other. 
I don't really know what went on over there. I never

16:03.593 --> 16:06.737
went into the dorm after it was occupied. And I did, 
you know, there were other girls over there, they

16:07.819 --> 16:17.912
didn't fill up the dormitory, and a lot of them 
asked for that dorm for some reason. I don't know

16:17.932 --> 16:24.501
whether they just wanted to be in a core dorm, core 
type, and they were cheaper than they were then.

16:24.662 --> 16:27.405
You're saying civilian girls. Right, right. And I 
did from time to time get phone calls from, from the

16:31.555 --> 16:33.380
parents of those girls. You know, every once in a 
while somebody's parents can't get in touch with

16:33.400 --> 16:38.694
them. And you know, as well as I do, usually they're 
out with somebody else and so forth, which I knew

16:38.714 --> 16:47.117
about. And this one parent was so devastated, and 
something has happened to his daughter, and I

16:47.823 --> 16:59.400
finally, you know, I was going to tell him, I 
finally said, I'm a father, and I have a daughter,

16:47.823 --> 16:59.400
and you have a right to know, too, that she's okay. 
She's just not in her own room. That's what

17:02.244 --> 17:05.009
happens. I mean, you can't do much about that. But 
I'm glad to have been there in that part of A&M's

17:08.193 --> 17:13.281
history. I'm sorry for half of the cause, but And 
looking back on it, it wasn't all that bad, but it

17:16.612 --> 17:20.378
was a mean time. Let's see, secret fraternities 
and so forth. I never, you're asking, I knew

17:25.726 --> 17:29.832
nothing about anything. And there was no 
investigation during your time about that? No.

17:33.277 --> 17:33.617
Okay. Other than Bob Melcher, I don't know what he 
was doing, but he asked me questions sort of like

17:34.078 --> 17:41.649
that. I just, I never knew anything like that. 
Because I think after that there was a, after

17:46.278 --> 17:50.547
your... I think there might have been some under 
Woodall because I do have one of those little

17:50.607 --> 18:01.711
mimeographed letters that they put out, but I 
don't know whether that was organized or not. And

18:01.731 --> 18:05.198
Jim Woodall took one of the whatever happened, I 
imagine,

18:05.937 --> 18:13.009
and he was a good man. He was a good man. I'm sorry I 
had to leave him with those problems, but the time

18:14.551 --> 18:19.820
came when the Army told me to leave. When you were 
Commandant, what was it like to be responsible for

18:20.841 --> 18:27.372
a Corps trip? Well, it wasn't any problem. Usually 
Jerry Maynard, the university employee, sent him

18:30.654 --> 18:43.976
up ahead of time to make arrangements with the 
police and all those people and tell them how to get

18:30.654 --> 18:43.976
a hold of him in case one of the guys was in trouble or 
got hurt or anything else. So we manned a phone and

18:44.537 --> 18:50.487
told the Corps, you know, if you need somebody, 
call this phone. The military people were

18:51.228 --> 18:53.612
required to go on these court trips just for the 
game, I mean for the marching band. We had no money

19:00.342 --> 19:01.804
to pay them. The Army would not give me per diem 
money. The Navy had it. They could pay their

19:07.873 --> 19:09.416
people. All I could get were the free football, two 
free football game tickets and we'd give them $10

19:10.157 --> 19:15.686
apiece. We had no trouble filling it because I say 
most of the officers were Aggies. And they would

19:20.930 --> 19:23.153
have probably paid us to go. And at least I never had 
any trouble filling up the Army officer. And my

19:28.400 --> 19:41.559
responsibility in those things was primarily, 
again, taking care of the reviewing officer,

19:28.400 --> 19:41.559
particularly Dr. Williams, which usually wasn't 
too much of a problem. But one year I didn't know he

19:41.599 --> 19:47.427
was going to fly up there in the old airport love 
field. And that the university didn't send a car,

19:48.200 --> 19:54.047
and I got a call from the elder, could I pick him up? 
And I said, yeah, I'll pick him up when we get in.

19:55.769 --> 19:59.233
Well, I was in my Vega, and that's all I had. I wasn't 
in my pickup. And he wasn't too charmed with riding

20:01.216 --> 20:08.725
in my Vega, and he told me, he said, don't ever pick 
me up in my little car like this again. And I said,

20:08.865 --> 20:10.146
yes, sir. And from then on, I'd had a university 
vehicle with me. Now, did you go to just about every

20:14.532 --> 20:17.295
Corps trip? Oh, yeah. Of all the four places where 
the Corps went on those trips, which ones were the

20:19.450 --> 20:27.362
most pleasant and which ones were the most 
difficult? Well, Austin, obviously, was always

20:28.123 --> 20:30.687
difficult. Is that right? Yes. Describe it. Well, 
half of the kids and the other hundreds or

20:33.632 --> 20:40.482
whatever, I don't know what I want to call them, And 
they'd boo them and so forth. But Dallas-Fort

20:45.019 --> 20:49.064
Worth, man, the bag is all the way up there. 
Houston?

20:53.710 --> 20:55.753
Houston was always great. That was, during my 
time, that was organized by old Harris, George

20:57.676 --> 21:06.888
Harris, moving stories. George was a big 
benefactor of the university. And he always got

21:10.634 --> 21:18.142
the review and stand, got the clearance and paid 
the thousand dollars that we had to pay the city and

21:10.634 --> 21:18.142
all that kind of stuff. But Houston, they liked the 
Aggies too. We'll have about a half or more Aggies

21:21.045 --> 21:23.568
in Houston anyway. And

21:24.730 --> 21:30.216
the local authorities cooperated? Yes, we never, 
never had any. They liked the Aggies too. The

21:34.200 --> 21:40.607
policemen liked the Aggies because of the uniform 
and all that stuff. To me, there's very little

21:40.857 --> 21:46.466
difference between the mentality of police and 
military anyway. Maybe the military officers

21:47.287 --> 21:52.915
might be a little better educated, but they still 
have the same mentality. Do you remember any other

21:52.936 --> 22:01.028
out-of-town football games during your 
commandant years that you went to? Well, I

22:01.048 --> 22:08.940
remember

22:01.048 --> 22:08.940
there was a rice game when Dr. Vandiver did his 
thing. I thought we were going to have a real, real

22:09.528 --> 22:12.632
problem. And I was in the stands, and I had a general 
officer with me, and I was in the uniform. But what

22:18.779 --> 22:35.179
really started it was these guys from Rice come out 
with T-shirts where they printed, fuck me, and I'm

22:18.779 --> 22:35.179
going to pardon the language in there, but that's 
what it said, which was very offensive, not to me as

22:18.779 --> 22:35.179
an Aggie, but to me as a person. And then they'd blow 
in the whistle, and the band march, They were

22:39.650 --> 22:43.378
wearing German helmets and had swastikas. I'm 
just amazed that they didn't go out of those

22:43.398 --> 22:49.452
things. Now, you were then campus security. You 
weren't commandant. I was commandant then. Oh,

22:55.004 --> 22:55.365
really? Because that's AD... When I was coming 
out, no, it wasn't, it was 70... It might have been

23:01.852 --> 23:04.336
that, I might have had my years wrong. Oh, it was 
Jarvis Miller. Yeah, yeah. Wasn't Vandiver.

23:10.847 --> 23:14.412
Vandiver's the one who directed the Rice Band that 
time. That's right, that's right. I got my stories

23:16.596 --> 23:18.178
wrong. And if I'm not mistaken, after the game was 
over, didn't some of us have to kind of go and help

23:18.597 --> 23:31.412
keep Aggies away from the Rice Band? Right, that 
did happen. Yeah. What about, were there any trips

23:35.577 --> 23:43.206
to, say, to West Point or any other out-of-town big 
games along the way that you remember? We

23:44.047 --> 23:44.908
didn't... Well, the kids didn't go to these games 
too much back then. The band couldn't go to too many

23:48.555 --> 23:50.457
of them. It was a financial thing. And I never 
really went to any other than the Corps trip games

23:51.798 --> 24:14.203
and maybe the Baylor game and one time to Lubbock 
when Don Johnson was still on flight pay and he'd do

23:51.798 --> 24:14.203
a cross country and we'd go in an Army aircraft.

24:15.432 --> 24:20.940
And incidentally, Don was probably the smartest 
thing I ever did as Commandant. He was already, you

24:21.901 --> 24:30.894
know, there under McCoy and he was working in the 
office and he worked for me a little while, a couple

24:21.901 --> 24:30.894
of years, and then he was transferred still on 
active duty. And he was transferred to an Army

24:31.514 --> 24:41.929
medical board in Pennsylvania and they dissolved 
the board. And we were talking on the phone one day,

24:42.432 --> 24:46.456
and I said, where are you going now, Don? They said, 
I don't know. I said, would you like to come back

24:47.377 --> 24:49.039
down here? Yeah, but they never met me. And I said, 
well, I don't know whether or not, but if you want to

24:51.202 --> 24:55.326
come back, let me give it a try. Well, I really knew a 
lot of people. You know, when you go through the

24:58.830 --> 25:02.394
Army War College, you make contact. And I knew 
quite a few people in the Pentagon. And I started

25:05.037 --> 25:06.238
calling around. Lo and behold, he called me one day 
and said, hey, I got orders. Come there now. So

25:10.603 --> 25:12.405
anyway, we got him back down. Then when he was a 
reserve officer, so he had to retire after 20. And I

25:17.280 --> 25:19.603
said, do you want to stay on? I'll see if I can get a 
position. And so I was able to get that position for

25:21.265 --> 25:24.228
him. And what position did you? The one he's in 
right now, assistant to the commandant. Yeah. And

25:29.394 --> 25:32.677
what were the duties of the assistant to the 
commandant, in fact? All the dirty jobs,

25:32.697 --> 25:36.942
disciplinary program Most of the coordination of 
core activities and that sort of stuff, just about

25:37.529 --> 25:47.566
anything you can think of Don did. And he's well 
deserving of the recognition that he has. He's a

25:51.653 --> 25:54.357
fantastic person. And I think these are the glue 
that has held that office together.

26:03.598 --> 26:06.542
Describe how Parsons Mounted Cavalry came about. 
Oh, that's right. Let's see. Well, let's see. I

26:08.586 --> 26:13.153
think this was in 71, no, 72. Three guys came in to 
see me and wanted to know if they'd been thinking

26:13.313 --> 26:22.487
about mounted units and this, that, and the other 
and how I feel about it. I said, well, you know, we

26:22.855 --> 26:25.018
used to have them. It sounded like a pretty good 
idea. But I said, well, how would it be? Do you think

26:30.827 --> 26:36.757
we could bring three horses in behind the Corps and 
one of the marching units? And I said, let me talk to

26:36.817 --> 26:41.063
Corps commander, but I think we can handle that. 
And so anyway, they did that. And the crowd seemed

26:43.407 --> 26:45.651
to like it a little bit. And so then we got together 
after that was over. They said, we really want to

26:49.636 --> 26:53.120
start this. What are your thoughts? And so I said, 
well, if we do it, I think it should be the same as RVs

26:53.982 --> 27:02.933
and everything else and activity oriented. But I 
think that it should not be open to company

27:03.914 --> 27:08.380
commanders or RVs. And they said, why? And I said, 
because these are already people that are in

27:10.563 --> 27:18.833
positions of responsibility and pride and so 
forth and all these others are good aggies, too,

27:19.235 --> 27:24.300
and let them have another outlet, which happened 
to be the cow. It isn't that way now, but that's the

27:24.320 --> 27:26.402
way it was originally. But anyway, I said, what do 
you need? And they said, well, we need some seed

27:29.445 --> 27:31.346
money. And I said, how much? And they said 10,000. I 
went over to see Buck Wires. And I had that money

27:37.332 --> 27:40.095
before I walked out of his office. I mean, he was 
just overjoyed. And so Buck, you know, stood

27:42.457 --> 27:47.942
behind us and got us going. Dean Fritz, John Fritz, 
I'm sure you know him, got wind of it, and he, gosh,

27:48.547 --> 28:01.785
what he's done for the cows, nobody can imagine, 
and money, and whatever.

28:04.488 --> 28:06.932
So you started with three horses. Three cows, 
well, the next year, we put them on the field. How

28:12.019 --> 28:12.379
many? I think 28, 30, something like that load. And 
they were their own horses? They had to have access

28:20.423 --> 28:23.608
to their own horse. It had to be a bale saw. They had 
to be able to financially take care of it. The

28:29.638 --> 28:36.508
university allowed us to use a strip of land out of 
Brownfield and there was an old army shelter

28:29.638 --> 28:36.508
there. Ten acres we could use. And they worked real 
hard out there and they were the real because we

28:42.327 --> 28:44.549
were going out and taking care of them. That's a 
long way out on the bike, and training and

28:44.569 --> 28:47.432
everything else. I went out there a lot of times, 
and my wife too. She loved to ride, and she rode with

28:53.358 --> 28:57.822
them out to nowhere else for us. But we got booted 
out of there. The engineer said they had to have

29:00.064 --> 29:04.208
that back. I don't believe it to this day, but they 
booted us over what they call a hernia hill which

29:09.530 --> 29:19.104
College Station now has a directory and a bunch of 
aggers owned it and they let them use that for a

29:09.530 --> 29:19.104
couple of years and then sold it to College 
Station. Then they bumped them out in the woods out

29:20.325 --> 29:27.295
there near the green where they are now and close to 
the arena. Give us two acres out there fully wooded

29:28.457 --> 29:35.487
and said this is all we can do. And so we started 
trying to clear it and build a barn and this, that,

29:35.753 --> 29:39.718
and the other. And when I say we, that's physically 
we and Army officers and some of the other kids that

29:39.778 --> 29:46.245
were around. But meanwhile,

29:46.285 --> 29:55.656
we all had moved in and had a good relationship with 
Dr. Miller. And he got on a wagon there with Dr.

29:56.637 --> 30:01.963
Miller and they went up to, O.D. Butler's office 
and told them they wanted the present location.

30:06.230 --> 30:07.471
You may know this story. And anyway, O.D. said, Dr. 
Miller, we can spare that piece of property from

30:11.335 --> 30:18.323
the agriculture department or whatever. And Dr. 
Miller said to him, Jim related this to me, that

30:19.204 --> 30:28.874
says, O.D., you're a general in the reserve, 
aren't you? And he said, yes, I am. You know that.

30:32.251 --> 30:36.375
And he says, when you get an order from your general 
boss, what do you do? And he says, I salute and say,

30:37.076 --> 30:39.799
yes, sir, and do it. And he says, what are you going 
to do now? Yes, sir, and salute him. And we got the

30:43.763 --> 30:45.185
land. And Jim was really, and Dr. Miller was really 
responsible for that. And that was a godsend. I

30:52.052 --> 30:56.477
don't think Cal would be around if it wasn't for 
that. And what are some of the proudest moments you

30:56.497 --> 31:00.081
remember about the cavalry or the mounted... 
Well, of course, I was overwhelmed when the...
