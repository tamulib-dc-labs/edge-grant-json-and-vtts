WEBVTT

00:02.258 --> 00:05.582
...Bless as the Korean War is... Over.

00:07.624 --> 00:12.389
Yeah, Korean veterans... Jim Marsh... Yeah, it's already over by then.

00:12.409 --> 00:12.870
Yeah, yeah.

00:12.890 --> 00:15.373
Jim Marsh, who was in my class, was a Korean vet.

00:15.393 --> 00:16.454
Yes, yes.

00:16.474 --> 00:23.061
So the only people that weren't in the Corps here were the returning Korean vets, and Marsh and several guys in our class were in that group.

00:23.081 --> 00:26.325
Did you...

00:26.305 --> 00:28.230
I was in between wars.

00:28.471 --> 00:30.918
And you didn't do much architecture work.

00:31.159 --> 00:31.821
Didn't do any.

00:31.841 --> 00:33.325
Well, I'm sorry, I worked part-time.

00:33.907 --> 00:35.912
But, I mean, oh, as a civilian?

00:36.213 --> 00:37.016
Mm-hmm.

00:37.036 --> 00:37.136
Okay.

00:37.156 --> 00:40.365
I worked on weekends, had a weekend job.

00:41.088 --> 00:46.099
And then I taught school, which was one of my first teaching experiences, actually.

00:46.139 --> 00:51.391
I taught what is the high school equivalency, GED.

00:51.912 --> 00:58.506
I taught three courses for GED candidates in the Army at night.

00:58.486 --> 01:03.153
that one of my friends said, hey, you're a college graduate, aren't you?

01:03.333 --> 01:04.695
You know, I think you could probably do this.

01:04.755 --> 01:05.416
Come over here.

01:05.436 --> 01:06.878
We got this program at night.

01:06.898 --> 01:08.580
We're teaching these fellas.

01:08.600 --> 01:13.147
So I taught English and algebra and slide rule.

01:14.990 --> 01:19.095
And I stayed one class in front of my class most of the time.

01:19.877 --> 01:22.300
Then you get out, and then what happens?

01:22.617 --> 01:26.821
I got out and began looking for work.

01:27.602 --> 01:39.013
Again, I made a fairly conscious decision that I didn't want to work in a big city, which is not the way most architects would play, that sort of thing.

01:39.033 --> 01:43.597
I don't know whether it was a mistake or not, but I didn't do that.

01:44.057 --> 01:51.004
So I started from Port Arthur, Texas and drifted up along the northeastern part of the state.

01:51.811 --> 01:59.445
And every time we got to a town, or a town of any size, I got the yellow pages out, looked to see who was there, and went and interviewed with them.

02:00.267 --> 02:11.608
And did that up through Longview and Tyler, and then cut across the top of the state, Greenville and Wichita Falls, and then came back through Temple and Bryan College Station probably.

02:12.128 --> 02:12.989
and back to Port Arthur.

02:13.009 --> 02:22.963
Now, if that trip didn't work, I had another one laid out to go further to the west and south and make another loop around the outsides of Houston and San Antonio and Austin, those places like that.

02:23.624 --> 02:41.950
But I hit a job in Wichita Falls where the architect, it was an architect and engineer together in partnership and the architect had just left in a fit and broken the Coke machine open with a two before and took his half the nickels and left and went to Beaumont, Texas.

02:42.520 --> 02:51.057
And what was left there was an engineer that had several major architecture jobs, a couple of banks, a couple of high schools, some major work.

02:51.077 --> 02:52.821
And there was no architect in the office.

02:53.202 --> 02:55.146
I mean, there was not a single architect in the office.

02:55.226 --> 02:57.711
And so he hired me and my traveling companion

02:59.176 --> 03:01.038
He hired me, and then he said, is there any more?

03:01.058 --> 03:03.160
And I said, yeah, but there's a guy waiting out in the car.

03:03.180 --> 03:04.162
He's looking for a job, too.

03:04.642 --> 03:05.203
So he went in.

03:05.243 --> 03:05.823
He hired him.

03:05.863 --> 03:07.926
Then we called two more classmates, and he hired them.

03:08.807 --> 03:10.849
So we had a whole bunch of us in his office.

03:11.109 --> 03:20.980
And sort of the good news, I guess, was that we were immediately immersed in responsible roles.

03:21.281 --> 03:22.502
We were in charge of a job.

03:24.224 --> 03:27.968
And we had almost total and complete reign.

03:28.673 --> 03:29.854
And we managed to swim.

03:29.894 --> 03:36.480
And we knew if we had to have help, we had a structural engineer standing over there that could help us with most of it.

03:36.500 --> 03:38.922
This is 1950?

03:38.942 --> 03:39.443
59.

03:39.483 --> 03:39.783
59.

03:40.444 --> 03:42.286
And you did that how long?

03:42.306 --> 03:43.226
I did it two years.

03:44.848 --> 03:56.959
We were feeling so fat and sassy at that time that we had taken a little trip up to, in between Denver and Colorado Springs up in the mountains, where one of my old army friends

03:58.424 --> 04:03.630
that I did a house for when we were in the Army, I actually didn't do much.

04:03.691 --> 04:07.168
He brought me a picture out of a home, House Beautiful,

04:07.688 --> 04:10.914
And they used to have their house of the year published once a year.

04:11.095 --> 04:16.405
And with it, for $5, you could send off and get plans of these really beautiful, large homes.

04:17.186 --> 04:18.669
And he did that, and he brought it over.

04:18.709 --> 04:26.264
And on my kitchen table, we changed a few things around, moved the bathroom here and there, and redid some floor plan, but otherwise built it.

04:26.324 --> 04:29.089
And so when I was up in Wichita Falls,

04:30.233 --> 04:31.255
I've been there two years.

04:31.336 --> 04:37.931
I thought, I'll run up and see my old friend from Kansas, and I'll just, I'm going to see if that house is up there, and sure enough, it was.

04:38.051 --> 04:47.753
He had built that house two years out of the Army, where we both were shaved-headed, and so far as we knew, both equally poor, but he wasn't poor.

04:48.948 --> 04:55.937
And he's a multi-multi-millionaire, and he's taken a whole bunch of money and made a whole bunch more out of it.

04:56.598 --> 05:00.323
And so he had a place up in the foothills, and it was beautiful.

05:00.343 --> 05:01.104
We got snowed in.

05:01.204 --> 05:04.088
We were up there two or three days longer than we had planned to be.

05:04.929 --> 05:18.567
And on the way out of there, driving back to Wichita Falls, Sunday afternoon, as I recall, it was a Sunday, and listening to the radio, Mr. Kennedy was interrupted, whatever we were listening to, and said, ask not.

05:19.019 --> 05:25.875
what you can do for your country, or your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country, and called us to active duty for the Berlin crisis.

05:27.057 --> 05:32.590
And I was to report the next morning at 7.30 to the armory in Wichita Falls for active duty.

05:34.021 --> 05:37.305
I didn't even have time to tell my boss, I'm gone.

05:37.345 --> 05:38.907
I've been conscripted or something.

05:40.388 --> 05:58.729
And about a week later, after we loaded up all our trucks and got all our gear, we were headed off to Fort Polk, Louisiana and opened a post that had been closed since 1945 and prepared pretty hard to go to Berlin.

05:58.709 --> 06:00.311
But we never did have to go.

06:00.771 --> 06:07.959
So I was fortunate to serve in the Army two times, active duty, and both times were in between wars.

06:07.999 --> 06:09.841
I didn't have to go any place.

06:09.861 --> 06:11.042
What do you mean you got out when?

06:12.164 --> 06:12.704
In 62.

06:12.744 --> 06:14.006
And then when?

06:14.146 --> 06:15.948
One year, almost to the day.

06:17.590 --> 06:27.180
At that time I thought, well, since I'm misplaced, I'm out of a job, I'm over here in the swamps of Louisiana, I think I'll go back to school.

06:28.105 --> 06:36.078
And the reason I thought I needed to go back to school, because I had my professional degree, I was licensed to practice architecture by the state.

06:37.079 --> 06:46.675
And I thought I need to go back to school because I had realized that there was a course I really, really needed to take that I didn't take, and it was an accounting course.

06:46.995 --> 06:49.379
I needed an accounting course.

06:49.399 --> 06:55.429
And while I was at it, I had talked to my department head, who at that time was Nicky Holloman, that was after

06:56.101 --> 06:57.810
Mr. Langford had stepped aside.

06:57.830 --> 07:04.305
I talked my department head into letting me skip an architecture history class

07:05.483 --> 07:15.298
And that was the same year that the Texas state government made political science or history one a requirement.

07:15.358 --> 07:15.799
Both of them.

07:15.819 --> 07:16.620
Both of them, OK.

07:17.061 --> 07:20.566
Well, they gave us some leeway because they were adding hours to our curriculum.

07:20.586 --> 07:23.491
So they gave us a little leeway with dropping a few things.

07:23.591 --> 07:27.296
And so I picked the things I liked the least and dropped those.

07:27.377 --> 07:30.702
And one of them was an architectural history course and then a few electives.

07:30.742 --> 07:32.925
That's where the accounting would have probably come in.

07:34.238 --> 07:39.423
And it didn't take me very long to be out in the real world to understand that I really needed all of those courses.

07:41.124 --> 07:42.185
So I came back to get them.

07:42.686 --> 07:43.226
Came back here?

07:43.366 --> 07:46.930
Came back to NM just because I was married and had two children at the time.

07:47.110 --> 07:47.930
And that's the fall of?

07:47.950 --> 07:48.931
62.

07:48.951 --> 07:49.432
62.

07:49.792 --> 07:53.756
And came back as a graduate student.

07:54.356 --> 07:55.918
How had the place changed?

07:56.558 --> 08:01.363
How had architecture here changed in your absence?

08:01.403 --> 08:03.925
It seemed to me to be more polished.

08:04.698 --> 08:08.722
to be a little more sophisticated, to have a more diverse faculty.

08:09.303 --> 08:10.464
Located where, physically?

08:10.624 --> 08:12.426
Located still in the academic building.

08:12.546 --> 08:12.986
Fourth floor?

08:13.006 --> 08:15.709
Fourth floor, which was our home until 1964.

08:16.830 --> 08:21.254
Was it larger in students and faculty numbers?

08:21.715 --> 08:28.922
I think so, but I probably couldn't give you a reasonable estimate of what the number was, because we were still all on the fourth floor.

08:28.942 --> 08:33.827
Who was the administrative head of architecture then?

08:33.908 --> 08:34.749
Nicky Holloman.

08:35.250 --> 08:36.191
Nicky Holloman.

08:36.211 --> 08:36.451
Yeah.

08:37.973 --> 08:39.756
So I didn't talk Nicky into it when I left.

08:39.816 --> 08:45.984
I talked Mr. Langford into it in 57 when I left, out of the two courses that I really wanted to come back to school to take.

08:47.266 --> 08:55.757
And while I was back here at school, I ended up with a master's degree, which was in retrospect the smartest thing I ever did.

08:55.817 --> 08:58.621
And that was completely by accident.

08:58.641 --> 09:02.025
Had the Army not pulled me out of Wichita Falls, I'd probably still be sitting up there.

09:02.866 --> 09:04.429
doing piddly little work.

09:06.253 --> 09:08.758
But I did finish that, and that was good.

09:08.818 --> 09:11.363
And that was the highest degree in this field at the time.

09:12.245 --> 09:13.267
And how long did that take?

09:14.289 --> 09:17.596
About two years, because I taught the whole time.

09:18.117 --> 09:20.301
When I came back to school, Mr. Romanek

09:21.007 --> 09:30.957
was the head of the program at that time, not just the fifth-year prof. He was the head of the program, so at that time he was called the chairman of the division, I believe it was.

09:31.017 --> 09:38.564
We quickly moved into a school status, and then he was, you know, he was, I think he was still chairman of the school.

09:39.265 --> 09:46.812
In 1969, we became an independent college for engineering, and he, Romnick, was the first dean.

09:46.792 --> 09:50.581
But Rominick told me when I came back, I was the only graduate student here.

09:51.263 --> 09:54.089
We had a master's degree, but I was the only graduate student in architecture.

09:56.014 --> 09:59.202
And so Mr. Rominick gave me three courses to teach.

10:00.926 --> 10:03.973
And by that, I mean there was no faculty member

10:04.207 --> 10:05.248
ever in sight.

10:05.308 --> 10:07.571
There's no faculty member's name on the roll, nothing.

10:07.671 --> 10:08.672
My name was on all of them.

10:08.692 --> 10:15.480
I taught three courses, three sections of 50 students, and I was buried under papers and trying to go to school.

10:15.500 --> 10:20.366
And I said, I told him at one time, I said, Mr. Romick, are you sure this is what graduate students do?

10:20.466 --> 10:21.868
I'm just buried with work.

10:21.888 --> 10:23.049
And he said, yeah, that's what they do.

10:23.069 --> 10:26.113
I'm sorry, just have to belly up and do it.

10:26.093 --> 10:28.756
How many courses were you taking at that time, probably?

10:29.237 --> 10:30.458
Oh, at least three.

10:31.039 --> 10:32.801
So you were teaching three and taking three.

10:32.821 --> 10:33.822
Yeah.

10:33.842 --> 10:34.183
At least.

10:34.944 --> 10:35.705
For two years.

10:36.365 --> 10:37.126
Yeah, a couple of years.

10:37.727 --> 10:43.194
Now, at that time, what did you think your career goal was at that point?

10:43.214 --> 10:44.435
To go into business for myself.

10:46.237 --> 10:47.659
I didn't expect to be back here then.

10:49.041 --> 10:55.088
And one of the greatest problems I've had since I came back here in 71

10:56.013 --> 11:13.135
was when I left here in 64, 65, somewhere around 65 I think it was, when I left here in 65 I threw all my old pay stubs away because I didn't think I'd ever come down this trail again so I was cleaning out to move and I threw all my pay stubs away.

11:13.696 --> 11:18.983
When I get back here in 71, which is another absolute fluky scenario,

11:19.705 --> 11:21.927
And I said, oh, by the way, I've worked here before.

11:21.947 --> 11:23.349
I worked here during this other period.

11:23.369 --> 11:26.191
And they never could find all of that stuff.

11:26.251 --> 11:27.793
And I didn't have any evidence of it.

11:27.833 --> 11:30.876
And I've been fighting that for 30 years, trying to get credit.

11:30.916 --> 11:31.697
I finally got credit.

11:31.717 --> 11:33.138
They said, OK, you've been here that long.

11:33.658 --> 11:37.382
But they won't give me vacation credit for it.

11:37.402 --> 11:38.603
I taught 12 months a year.

11:38.863 --> 11:41.566
I taught in the summer and both semesters.

11:42.247 --> 11:45.730
Alan Stacel and Graham Horsley and I taught all the freshmen.

11:46.469 --> 11:52.140
Every course, fall, spring, and summer, for those three years that I was here, side by side.

11:52.240 --> 11:54.304
You were here three years finishing your masters?

11:54.905 --> 11:56.709
Was that when you mean the three years?

11:57.130 --> 11:57.250
Yes.

11:57.450 --> 12:00.917
I finished my master in 64, so I said 62, 63, 64.

12:00.937 --> 12:02.179
Three years, yeah.

12:02.260 --> 12:05.085
Then you left and went where?

12:06.263 --> 12:09.849
I worked here in town for a year with D.D.

12:09.909 --> 12:26.075
Matthews, architects, because I was working for him part-time during my last year of school, and so I just stayed on and worked with him for another year, and then I went into business with an old classmate of mine over in Nacogdoches, Texas.

12:27.237 --> 12:33.267
He had been trying to talk me to come over there and join him for some time, and I finally did in 66 go there.

12:33.871 --> 12:43.117
and got five years of experience being in business for myself, which was a different kind of experience.

12:43.238 --> 12:48.252
What did you learn from that, that would be important to you as a teacher?

12:49.447 --> 12:56.997
The same thing that former students call back and tell me on a regular basis, I hope to heaven you're teaching those kids something about business.

12:58.019 --> 13:02.665
And I had realized that before, that's why I came back to take that accounting course.

13:02.805 --> 13:05.929
I knew I needed some more business kind of background.

13:05.949 --> 13:13.159
And when I was in business myself, I knew I needed a lot more about business, finance, contracts, law.

13:13.308 --> 13:22.500
the business of running large complex projects, just lots of the whole management area, operations and management.

13:22.940 --> 13:27.727
So then you come back to stay in 1971.

13:28.508 --> 13:28.808
Yes.

13:29.008 --> 13:30.130
How did that come about?

13:30.450 --> 13:41.965
Well, it came about because a couple of decent jobs came up in Nacogdoches that my partner and I should have gotten.

13:42.333 --> 13:43.775
One of which was a bank.

13:43.915 --> 13:44.896
It was our bank.

13:44.916 --> 13:48.941
It's where we banked and borrowed money and paid money back and things like that.

13:49.001 --> 13:54.468
We knew all the people on a first-name basis in the bank and the bank was getting ready to hire an architect and build a new bank.

13:55.730 --> 13:58.553
And we didn't even get asked to interview for the job.

13:59.915 --> 14:07.885
And another one was an automobile dealership and the owner of the automobile dealership, we ran around with his son

14:08.219 --> 14:10.748
played golf and did things like that.

14:10.928 --> 14:16.026
And he was on the board of trustees for the large church that we had done in Nacogdoches.

14:16.989 --> 14:19.056
And so we knew him very well, too.

14:19.711 --> 14:26.500
And we had just seen the neatest automobile dealership we'd ever seen in San Antonio one day, for some reason, built in among the trees.

14:26.600 --> 14:33.689
Nacogdoches had a propensity, when they wanted to build something, is just bulldozing down everything and building something nice and flat.

14:34.430 --> 14:41.960
And my partner and I, Carl Maynard, had had the idea all along that, why are we cutting down all these beautiful trees?

14:42.421 --> 14:45.465
Just to build things, we ought to be able to do better than that.

14:45.749 --> 14:51.397
Anyway, we wanted that Ford dealership because we wanted to do a really nice Ford dealership.

14:51.417 --> 14:54.762
We thought one could be done, something just beside the parking lot.

14:54.782 --> 14:56.424
And again, we didn't get interviewed.

14:57.526 --> 15:06.478
So in what in business we called a post-denial evaluation, we went back and said, why?

15:07.360 --> 15:08.141
Why, Tipton?

15:08.882 --> 15:10.244
You knew we're here.

15:10.704 --> 15:11.566
We're here all the time.

15:11.606 --> 15:12.727
We bought our cars from you.

15:12.747 --> 15:13.328
We know you.

15:13.348 --> 15:15.351
We know your kid.

15:15.871 --> 15:21.420
And you've gone off and hired somebody and getting ready to build this Ford dealership and said, well, in the Ford business, all the wheel that squeaks the loudest.

15:21.860 --> 15:23.904
And I never did hear from you boys, so I didn't think you were interested.

15:23.924 --> 15:26.247
And so I just said, I'm out of here.

15:26.368 --> 15:26.828
I'm gone.

15:27.229 --> 15:37.986
And I was, in fact, in Dallas interviewing and had some very good opportunities being presented to me in Dallas, some very good opportunities, when Romanek called me.

15:38.507 --> 15:43.735
Romanek is weaved in and out of my life since I was 18 years old, since I was 20 years old.

15:44.474 --> 15:59.678
Ramanick called me and said get down here I need to talk to you and so I came down here and when I was here he said I want you to come and be the director of our new research center, the architecture research center and put that program together for me.

16:00.380 --> 16:09.975
It needs a little management help and we need a little more direction out there and whatever and I want you to come and run that program for me and I'll pay you fifteen thousand dollars a year.

16:10.698 --> 16:14.289
which in those particular days was a decent salary.

16:15.292 --> 16:16.997
Not great, but decent, very decent.

16:17.939 --> 16:19.223
And when I got here, I found out

16:19.760 --> 16:29.132
that once again that turkey had screwed me around because I was being paid the same thing Randy Walagura and Russell Stogstall were being paid who were under me.

16:29.412 --> 16:38.765
I was getting ready to be their boss and they were, I taught them when I was a graduate student here, five years or whatever it was before then, they were in one of my classes.

16:41.849 --> 16:46.054
Fortunately I didn't stay at that level very long either.

16:46.523 --> 17:13.020
because shortly thereafter, like in 73 maybe, the person that had been the academic assistant dean, in those days we actually had associate deans and assistant deans, and the associate dean typically was involved with research and coordination and being executive dean, and the assistant dean was the academic

17:13.000 --> 17:17.085
affairs dean, particularly undergraduate, and we were basically an undergraduate program.

17:17.125 --> 17:33.085
So anyway, the guy that was the assistant dean for academic affairs left, who I had taught as a graduate student too, when I was a graduate student, he left, and so Romanek asked me to come across the bridge and take that job, which, and I did.

17:35.900 --> 17:40.346
And I was still in that job when our next dean, Raymond Darrell Reed, came along.

17:40.366 --> 17:43.691
But wait, let's stay with this.

17:45.534 --> 17:53.765
When you got back, this is 71, when you got back, the architecture program was located in the building where it is now.

17:54.506 --> 17:55.107
Is that right?

17:55.087 --> 17:59.875
No, we were in what we call building C now, the building we occupied in 64.

18:00.195 --> 18:01.317
We were in that building.

18:01.357 --> 18:02.239
The dean was in that building.

18:02.279 --> 18:03.501
All the departments were in that building.

18:03.701 --> 18:05.404
There were five departments.

18:06.225 --> 18:12.916
And we had the old hospital that is now torn down, but we had the entire old hospital.

18:13.617 --> 18:16.622
We had two or three of the barracks, three I believe.

18:17.547 --> 18:21.151
And we used some rooms in some other buildings.

18:21.531 --> 18:22.892
So we were scattered all over the campus.

18:23.393 --> 18:30.580
At that time, the program was a five-year baccalaureate degree in architecture?

18:30.881 --> 18:33.403
It started switching when we became a college in 1969.

18:33.523 --> 18:36.146
It started switching.

18:36.226 --> 18:41.952
Romanek was switching it from a five-year program to a four-two or undergraduate and graduate.

18:42.438 --> 18:50.038
component, and the last graduates with a five-year degree left in 72, just when I got here, shortly after I got here.

18:50.059 --> 18:57.679
Do you have any perception as to the faculty and student numbers when you got back in 71?

18:58.790 --> 19:05.316
My recollection is there were about 800, but that's in all the five departments, four programs.

19:05.996 --> 19:08.939
Architecture being an undergraduate and a graduate department.

19:08.959 --> 19:10.080
What were those other programs?

19:10.781 --> 19:12.422
Landscape, one.

19:12.742 --> 19:13.963
Construction science, two.

19:14.344 --> 19:15.205
Planning, three.

19:15.825 --> 19:17.406
And architecture, four and five.

19:18.167 --> 19:21.270
Because the undergraduate architecture component was a separate department at that time.

19:22.591 --> 19:27.075
Who were the key faculty members in those programs in the early 70s?

19:29.283 --> 19:33.809
Well, the department heads, and that would be Jim Marsh in construction science.

19:34.070 --> 19:41.480
Who else was in construction?

19:41.500 --> 19:43.943
Who were the other faculty members that best known?

19:46.126 --> 19:47.929
You're going to surprise me, Haskell.

19:50.011 --> 19:52.675
Willard Cootie, Carol Kleykamp,

19:57.042 --> 19:59.445
Okay, we can slide on to that.

19:59.825 --> 20:09.578
Bill Kellett, Albert Padula, Jerry Trost, they were all in construction science and landscape headed by Robert F. White.

20:11.500 --> 20:17.127
Michael Murphy, who I taught when I was a graduate student, was in there.

20:18.406 --> 20:26.915
Shortly after I got here, Bob White retired and Don Austin came to be the department head and has been a major player in that department ever since.

20:28.917 --> 20:32.101
It's a very small program so there's not going to be too many faculty in there.

20:34.984 --> 20:42.892
And planning, Chewy Hinojosa, Jesus Hinojosa.

20:43.192 --> 20:44.734
Was he the department head?

20:46.942 --> 21:04.405
He wasn't the first, the first department head was Joe McGraw and Joe, I don't remember when Joe quit being department head but Jesus Hinojosa came on about that time and was department head for several years and it was a pretty small program too and a graduate only program it didn't have an undergraduate component at all.

21:04.705 --> 21:05.707
Then in architecture.

21:05.827 --> 21:11.194
And then architecture and the the head of architecture at that particular moment

21:12.980 --> 21:18.106
When I came back here was Alan Stasel.

21:19.468 --> 21:24.533
Yes, Stasel was the head of the program whenever we became a college.

21:24.654 --> 21:29.579
He was part of the team that put together the proposal that we become a separate college.

21:30.300 --> 21:34.465
So Stasel in the undergraduate, the environmental design program, and David

21:34.765 --> 21:35.866
No, no, no.

21:35.987 --> 21:40.312
Wes Harper was head of the architecture program at that moment in time.

21:40.332 --> 21:44.478
How had the curriculum... And Romanek was a faculty member.

21:44.498 --> 21:55.693
Since you first arrived as a student, until the time you arrived the last time as a faculty member, how had the curriculum in architecture changed?

21:55.775 --> 21:59.019
Well, it changed a pretty good bit because the concept was changing.

21:59.059 --> 22:05.467
What the architects of our curriculum were doing at that time were trying to change this way.

22:05.567 --> 22:12.816
Let's see if we can't have a two-year program for anyone that wanted to be in any of our programmatic areas.

22:13.176 --> 22:18.863
We'll have two years that are common, and we'll all take basic design, we'll all take history, we'll all take math, we'll all do things like that.

22:19.383 --> 22:28.635
And then at the end of the second year a person would make a choice to go to one of these other programs be it landscape or construction and ironically planning wasn't playing at that time.

22:28.695 --> 22:34.082
They were planning grew out of us offering one course in planning when I was a student here.

22:34.162 --> 22:38.848
We had one elective in planning and and it was taught by Joe McGraw.

22:38.868 --> 22:42.353
Joe McGraw later become a department head and it was built off of this one course.

22:43.025 --> 22:44.668
landscape had been here for a little while.

22:44.808 --> 22:46.070
It came from horticulture.

22:46.371 --> 22:51.599
That's where Robert White was when he had his first small classes over in that area.

22:51.739 --> 22:55.686
And construction science just grew out of our optional program from quite a ways back.

22:55.726 --> 22:58.130
So it's sort of been with the architecture program for a long, long time.

23:00.334 --> 23:01.776
Anyway, we

23:02.093 --> 23:09.001
The idea was that you would go into construction science, or into landscape, or into architecture, and then follow it up.

23:09.041 --> 23:12.285
And in architecture, it would go another two years to finish your professional degree.

23:12.785 --> 23:15.208
And in the other two, they would remain baccalaureate programs.

23:16.149 --> 23:31.206
But the phenomenon that we witnessed during those early years was that the other two programmatic areas, well, in fact, all three of the other programmatic areas outside of architecture, were actually growing up and taking on an identity of their own.

23:31.186 --> 23:54.966
and the more they got the more sophisticated they got the more and better faculty they got the more and better students they got and and that was all driven by a pretty good job market for at least the construction science guys they didn't want to they didn't want to waste their first two years taking kiddie architecture courses so there was there was sort of a natural phenomenon beginning to happen with people

23:55.402 --> 24:02.595
trying to get rid of or water down the original model that the college was started on, based on.

24:04.498 --> 24:11.931
And in fact today, the only program that is anywhere close to that model is the architecture program by itself.

24:13.234 --> 24:18.523
And so it's really not a model anymore, it's just kind of a regular architecture curriculum, but instead of being a five-year baccalaureate,

24:19.651 --> 24:35.652
The minute it went to, and I know this is the kind of thing that legislators and others fear, but the minute it went from a five-year baccalaureate program to a six-year graduate degree program, which was not substantially different than the five-year program,

24:35.885 --> 24:37.749
But it took on a different kind of life.

24:38.251 --> 24:52.003
Just being in the graduate college and following the graduate college rules and having different places to submit degree plans and that sort of thing began to change the whole environment of the last two years in architecture.

24:51.983 --> 24:55.708
And it's sort of like the analogy I was making with Romnick's grading.

24:57.571 --> 25:02.358
The program began to think of itself in better terms, just because it was in better terms.

25:02.919 --> 25:14.015
So you are saying that the six-year program, the four plus two, you think was far better, that that was a good step instead of a five-year program.

25:14.035 --> 25:14.255
Yes.

25:14.716 --> 25:15.897
Yes, absolutely.

25:15.917 --> 25:16.518
Without question.

25:17.059 --> 25:21.906
In fact, now then, 69 to 99, 30 years later,

25:21.886 --> 25:34.767
We have a national referendum going on in our business where all of the Associated Collegiate Schools of Architecture and the accrediting board and all of the groups together have just made their first pass.

25:34.947 --> 25:38.713
They have another one to go, but they've just made their first pass at requiring

25:38.693 --> 25:41.457
No, they're going to refuse to accredit five-year programs.

25:41.637 --> 25:42.078
Really?

25:42.098 --> 25:43.139
Starting in about five years.

25:43.660 --> 25:44.040
No, ten years.

25:44.061 --> 25:45.923
They're going to give everybody ten years to switch.

25:46.464 --> 25:46.965
Get out of it.

25:46.985 --> 25:49.949
We're not accrediting any new ones, and that's just the first volley across your bow.

25:51.030 --> 25:52.132
We're going to get rid of them.

25:52.152 --> 25:53.894
Were we a pioneer in that?

25:54.014 --> 25:54.275
Yes.

25:55.176 --> 25:55.396
Yes.

25:56.438 --> 25:58.641
Any other notable examples that were?

25:59.722 --> 26:05.190
Well, the report that pushed all of that off, I was in Nacogdoches at the time, but the report that pushed all of that off

26:06.217 --> 26:08.182
was the Princeton Report.

26:09.886 --> 26:11.791
Was it on education generally or just architecture?

26:12.132 --> 26:12.914
I think generally.

26:13.034 --> 26:13.816
I think it was too.

26:14.397 --> 26:22.217
But something in there pushed Romnick and Staisal and Cecil Stewart was our associate dean at the time.

26:22.433 --> 26:30.605
who just retired 20 years being dean up at Nebraska, pushed those guys off of center and said, we can do better than this.

26:30.886 --> 26:31.807
And they just did it.

26:32.408 --> 26:36.314
And we were like one of two schools in 1969 that had gone to that model.

26:37.215 --> 26:39.739
Today, it's a little over 50% of the schools in the country.

26:40.941 --> 26:47.510
And most of the architects out there that have a five-year degree, I have one, but I don't count myself in that camp.

26:47.771 --> 26:51.917
But most of the architects that do think that's the degree God intended architects to have.

26:52.437 --> 26:55.000
You're talking religion now if you're going to mess with my degree.

26:57.463 --> 27:06.034
Texas Tech, who's always had the reputation in this state of being the more vocational, the more technical kind of architecture school at least.

27:06.655 --> 27:16.027
Texas Tech a few years ago, no more than five years ago, just convinced their board and coordinating board and changed from a five-year baccalaureate degree to a five-year master's degree just like that.

27:16.989 --> 27:18.951
And there's no baccalaureate degree in the program.

27:20.264 --> 27:23.107
and they began getting graduate credit at the end of three and a half years.

27:24.549 --> 27:25.249
Unbelievable.

27:25.570 --> 27:32.518
Well, it had to do also with Chancellor Monford, which I'm sure had something to do with that, getting such good approval on the Coordinating Board and so on.

27:33.118 --> 27:40.126
But the worm is turning, but it's been a long, slow turn, but it's turning faster.

27:40.186 --> 27:43.950
Who deserves most of the credit for that decision here?

27:44.210 --> 27:44.671
Romanek.

27:44.691 --> 27:45.292
Romanek?

27:45.312 --> 27:45.572
Yes.

27:46.133 --> 27:48.415
Now, there's a practical matter.

27:48.395 --> 27:57.087
He had some awfully good advisors around him, Stacel and Cecil and things like that, but the inspirational and the spiritual leader of the group is Romanek.

27:57.628 --> 28:07.682
In the early 70s, how did you and your colleagues feel about the campus leadership at that time, John Calhoun and Jack Williams and so forth?

28:10.325 --> 28:13.069
I can't honestly say that we thought a lot about it at all.

28:13.673 --> 28:19.524
Well, did you feel that architecture was being supported, that architecture was moving along?

28:19.604 --> 28:26.397
Oh, we've always had the idea that architecture is not supported as well as the other fields, and a lot of that's of our own making.

28:26.437 --> 28:27.239
Of course, we know that.

28:28.762 --> 28:34.112
But there was no research in architecture and no PhD being offered in architecture.

28:35.678 --> 28:37.681
And those two things, of course, go together.

28:37.781 --> 28:48.359
So we were looked at and I think generally felt like we were never getting what we thought ought to be our full shake from the administration.

28:49.100 --> 28:52.125
But we were part of the problem, too.

28:53.347 --> 28:59.998
John Calhoun came, the first time I recall when I was in a leadership kind of role, John Calhoun came over and talked to us.

29:01.615 --> 29:07.174
And he said, somebody asked him, what was he called?

29:07.555 --> 29:08.739
Vice President for Academic Affairs.

29:09.321 --> 29:12.150
What does the Vice President for Academic Affairs do exactly?

29:12.291 --> 29:13.836
Somebody asked him, he said, well,

29:14.356 --> 29:19.322
Everything that has to do with academic affairs falls under the auspices of the vice president for academic affairs.

29:19.642 --> 29:26.170
Now that means curriculum and students and of course we have to house the students so that means dormitories and we have to get students from the dorms to class.

29:26.190 --> 29:28.492
That means sidewalks and parking places.

29:30.094 --> 29:34.179
And I thought when I listened to him, well what are all those other vice presidents to do?

29:34.940 --> 29:37.883
I don't know but John Calhoun seemed to think

29:38.487 --> 29:42.315
I think that's how we got the word provost, came right after a feeling like that.

29:44.499 --> 29:47.285
And I know that you were on that team at that particular moment in history.

29:48.367 --> 29:49.168
And Dick Way nerdy.

29:51.814 --> 29:59.449
And Dr. Ramanick, Professor Ramanick, Dean Ramanick, retired as dean?

29:59.429 --> 30:02.699
during that, during the early 70s?

30:03.942 --> 30:06.951
Yes, I think Raymond Darrell Reed came in 75.

30:07.994 --> 30:09.920
Why did he, was it age?

30:10.482 --> 30:11.886
No, no, he was fired.

30:13.013 --> 30:17.940
If he wasn't fired, he was told in words of one syllable, we're going to replace you.

30:17.960 --> 30:18.782
No, he was replaced.

30:18.842 --> 30:20.284
Do you have any idea as to why?

30:20.424 --> 30:21.886
Yes, the 402 curriculum.

30:22.547 --> 30:23.348
Oh, okay.

30:23.368 --> 30:24.470
This is a religious matter.

30:25.632 --> 30:26.413
Oh, okay.

30:26.854 --> 30:31.240
Besides, Ramanick was never a public relations person at all.

30:33.083 --> 30:42.717
If you knew him, you loved him, but it was sometimes hard to get past his little first barrier, and he took great pride in that, so that he didn't make friends really easy.

30:43.338 --> 30:52.542
And there were some serious former students who were complaining to the administration about this fellow Romanek and what he was doing.

30:53.746 --> 30:56.132
How did those of you on the faculty feel about his departure?

30:58.998 --> 31:03.565
My best recollection is we thought it was probably normal.

31:04.466 --> 31:06.509
We thought he was being pushed out.

31:07.471 --> 31:08.812
