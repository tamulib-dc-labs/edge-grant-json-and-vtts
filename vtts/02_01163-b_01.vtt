WEBVTT

00:04.908 --> 00:06.750
Okay, this is just a sound check. Bob, say 
something. Hello, my name is Bob. How many people

00:09.234 --> 00:13.299
check this door here? Probably like 100. I don't 
know why they can't have it open. Okay, this is Ron

00:16.624 --> 00:25.676
Shorn, and I'm interviewing Bob Havlin at the 
American Astronomical Society Berkeley meeting

00:16.624 --> 00:25.676
on June 6, 1993. So, Bob, for the record, what's 
your full name? Robert James Havlin. How do you

00:31.944 --> 00:32.645
spell that? H-A-V-L-E-N. Where were you born? 
Utica, New York. And when? 1943. A date? Oh yeah,

00:41.157 --> 00:42.218
September 16. How'd you get interested in 
astronomy in the first place? I think it was a Boy

00:46.924 --> 00:51.570
Scout project or a science fair project when I was 
in the sixth or seventh grade. I had to draw some

00:51.590 --> 00:54.394
maps of the night sky and find north. That started 
my desire to look through telescopes and to buy a

00:55.876 --> 01:03.045
telescope and eventually made my own telescope 
and Gradually became more and more in contact with

01:03.751 --> 01:06.715
the astronomical community. I was good at school. 
Where did you go to undergrad school? Went to the

01:10.782 --> 01:11.903
University of Rochester. And when did you 
graduate from there? 1965. And what was your

01:14.948 --> 01:15.769
major? Astrophysics. Did you start out in 
astrophysics? I started out in astrophysics.

01:21.939 --> 01:22.099
Why? Why did I start in astrophysics? Because with 
my middle school and high school experience in

01:24.983 --> 01:31.513
making my own telescope and reading about 
astronomy, I decided that was an area that I wanted

01:32.101 --> 01:34.783
to go into. As a matter of fact, I only applied as an 
undergraduate to Cornell and to the University of

01:34.823 --> 01:47.335
Rochester in New York State because those were the 
only schools that had undergraduate degrees in

01:34.823 --> 01:47.335
astronomy.

01:48.155 --> 01:49.737
Where did you go to grad school and why? I went to the 
University of Arizona because I realized that I

01:50.297 --> 01:59.205
needed to be at a clear sight where I could get into 
astronomy. It had a good national reputation. It

02:01.087 --> 02:02.108
was growing. I applied to the University of 
Michigan and to Harvard. I got accepted at

02:05.479 --> 02:13.807
Michigan, didn't get accepted at Harvard, and 
then Arizona and NASA traineeship and so on. It was

02:13.827 --> 02:19.732
the best decision of my then young life. Because 
the University of Arizona, of course, is right

02:19.752 --> 02:26.537
across the street from Kitt Peak National 
Observatory. So what did you do at Arizona? At

02:29.300 --> 02:31.842
Arizona?

02:32.986 --> 02:42.179
I got interested in x-ray astronomy and optical 
astronomy and no radio astronomy really. And

02:42.840 --> 02:55.479
gradually did a thesis under Bengt Westerlund 
using photographic data and photoelectric data

02:42.840 --> 02:55.479
on Cepheids and OB associations and the 
relationship of them. And when did you get out? Why

02:56.921 --> 02:57.682
did you pick that? Why did I pick that? Was it the 
person or the field? Person, primarily, I think.

03:04.702 --> 03:15.798
It was the ease with which I was able to work with Dr. 
Westerlund and his vast experience in the field of

03:04.702 --> 03:15.798
observational optical astronomy. Of course, I 
was exposed to almost everything there was to be

03:16.659 --> 03:28.577
exposed to back in the late 1960s because of our 
interaction with Kitt Peak National

03:16.659 --> 03:28.577
Observatory. And there were theoreticians 
around. You know, I did fairly well at most of my

03:32.825 --> 03:49.249
courses, but I found

03:32.825 --> 03:49.249
after thinking about what I really wanted to do for 
three or four months, I decided that I wanted to go

03:32.825 --> 03:49.249
into studying Cepheids and OB associations with 
Bank. He had lots of, he was an interesting guy. He

03:51.672 --> 04:01.707
had lots of unreduced observational data to work 
with and was inspirational in helping me decide,

03:51.672 --> 04:01.707
you know, what further observations were to be 
made and so on. I think that's Sort of a typical

04:03.385 --> 04:06.370
interaction. It wasn't a question of money, as it 
is these days, because I was supported by a NASA

04:06.450 --> 04:12.760
traineeship. Was that your first contact with an 
ASA? Yes, basically it was.

04:23.297 --> 04:24.499
When did you finish your? I finished in late 1969. 
When you were a grad student at Stuart, did any of

04:28.242 --> 04:37.996
the infighting, well, or let's put it this way, 
Kuiper and Bart Bock were perhaps not the world's

04:28.242 --> 04:37.996
greatest friends? You know, I didn't really get 
too much feel from that. I mean, Bock came in 1967

04:43.404 --> 04:49.272
after I'd been there a couple of years. He was 
always telling stories about Kuiper and Bach, and

04:50.062 --> 05:00.117
I don't know, there was another guy, another 
Dutchman that came over to the U.S. about the same

04:50.062 --> 05:00.117
time as those two, and I can't remember. I think it 
was a guy,

05:01.038 --> 05:10.232
Peter Vandekamp, was it? No, but it's in Ray 
White's obituary at Bach, so we can look at it.

05:13.877 --> 05:15.580
Yeah, yeah, it's kind of neat, yeah. Did people at 
Stuart or Kitt Peak look down on planetary work as

05:16.100 --> 05:24.872
far as you know? Did the grad students say, oh, if I 
can't get in with somebody that does stellar work,

05:24.932 --> 05:30.841
I'll have to do planetary? Was any of that kind of 
stuff still left when you were there? I don't think

05:36.409 --> 05:36.989
so. Now that I think of it, yeah. Being a graduate 
student at Stuart was an interesting experience

05:40.147 --> 05:47.401
because you had a lunar and planetary lab right 
across the street. And the people that did

05:49.204 --> 06:00.265
planetary science, like Tom Garrels, like Pat 
Romer,

06:01.797 --> 06:08.629
I can't think of a few more names that were 
associated with a lunar and planetary

06:01.797 --> 06:08.629
observatory. They were there, yeah, exactly. And 
I never got the feeling that this was a

06:10.572 --> 06:17.925
secondary science. There was Bill Hartman, for 
example. He was there. I mean, it was interesting

06:20.289 --> 06:21.512
stuff. It just so happened that you know, you 
really do have a difference of opinion as to

06:23.482 --> 06:30.493
whether you want to go into planetary science. I 
mean, planetary science is almost like geology.

06:32.275 --> 06:34.419
It's close to home. And at least that was my 
feeling. I didn't want to get into planetary

06:35.701 --> 06:39.687
science, and I knew other graduate students that 
really didn't want to get into planetary science.

06:39.707 --> 06:41.530
They were more interested in stars and galaxies. 
And that's just sort of a natural, because there

06:42.591 --> 06:51.565
were graduate students, as a matter of fact, Ben 
Zellner, who's now, I guess he does asteroid work

06:53.333 --> 07:03.583
with , there was , there was a few other graduate 
students. Planetary science was a real

07:04.583 --> 07:07.426
challenge. It just wasn't something that I wanted 
to get into. Where'd you go after you got your

07:10.109 --> 07:13.912
degree? In January of 1970, we packed our bags, put 
our car on a boat, got on an airplane, and went to

07:22.882 --> 07:23.883
Chile.

07:26.647 --> 07:39.186
I became a staff member at the European Southern 
Observatory,

07:26.647 --> 07:39.186
primarily because Westerland, my thesis advisor 
six months earlier, had become the director

07:26.647 --> 07:39.186
there, and he said, Bob, why don't you come down for 
a year? So I said, fine, a year, I'll go anywhere.

07:42.090 --> 07:43.011
Ended up being settled. What did you work on there 
in general? In general, I was a staff astronomer,

07:46.757 --> 07:51.724
of course, and I had to assist him. all the 
equipment for all the visiting astronomers in

07:52.261 --> 08:00.293
terms of Kude spectrographs, Castorine 
spectrographs, single channel photometers and

07:52.261 --> 08:00.293
so on. And I continued my interest in OB 
associations and started surveying some of the

08:01.115 --> 08:20.985
southern Milky Way in terms of accumulating data 
that would allow us to then determine whether or

08:01.115 --> 08:20.985
not the young blue stars we were detecting were 
actually members of associations or whether they

08:01.115 --> 08:20.985
were just in the field. And when did you leave there 
and why? I left there in May of 1977, and we'd been in

08:24.882 --> 08:42.843
Chile seven years, and our daughters were then one 
and four years, so we decided to come back to the

08:24.882 --> 08:42.843
States, and we didn't want our kids growing up 
Chilean, basically. And the position I got in the

08:44.005 --> 08:50.753
U.S. was as a lecturer at the University of 
Virginia in Charlottesville. And I found it very

08:51.745 --> 08:59.496
difficult to look for a position from outside the 
US to get back into the US. And so I was very grateful

08:59.516 --> 09:07.308
to be able to get some kind of temporary position 
from which I could use as a base to look for a more

08:59.516 --> 09:07.308
permanent position. And that fell into place, 
unfortunately, upon the death of Nelson

09:07.328 --> 09:16.020
Lindbergh. This is D. Nelson Lindbergh. D. Nelson 
Lindbergh, exactly. And so what was this

09:19.225 --> 09:20.807
permanent place? Well, the position I got was 
University of Virginia as lecturer. And I was

09:25.561 --> 09:29.885
actually on the staff there for two years. And at 
the end of the second year, which would be 1979, in

09:29.905 --> 09:49.022
the middle 19s after academic year, 78, 79, I then 
took up a position at the National Radio Astronomy

09:29.905 --> 09:49.022
Observatory, more of an administrative position 
as assistant to the director with Mark Roberts. At

09:49.880 --> 09:59.815
that point, it was better not to have to move the 
family than to go to Washington, D.C. or someplace

09:49.880 --> 09:59.815
like that. Why did they pick you? I was a warm body. 
No, Mort Roberts and I got along very well. I had

10:06.726 --> 10:13.837
worked earlier as a summer student at NRAO in 1964 
in Green Bank with Mort. And I was interested in

10:14.658 --> 10:16.461
a... in an administrative position because I had 
been interviewed. Actually, I had been offered a

10:20.245 --> 10:25.332
job at the National Science Foundation by Bill 
Howard. And so I was trying to decide, did I want to

10:25.352 --> 10:30.660
leave Charlottesville and move to Washington or 
what? And Mort had just taken up position as

10:30.680 --> 10:37.489
director at NRAO about six months earlier, and he 
realized that he needed help. So for me, it was a new

10:38.251 --> 10:41.195
challenge I was happy to move into. How long did you 
stay there? Oh, I was with the NRAO, actually,

10:44.015 --> 10:48.599
until just the beginning of this year. I was in 
Charlottesville until mid-1988. So that's 11

10:52.683 --> 10:58.268
years in Charlottesville and an additional four 
years in Socorro. At the VLA. At the VLA, right.

11:03.212 --> 11:12.520
When you first went into the National Radio 
Astronomy Observatory, did you notice any

11:03.212 --> 11:12.520
difference between optical and radio 
astronomers? As a matter of fact, I did. I've

11:16.111 --> 11:19.574
always noticed the difference between optical 
and radio astronomers. You want to know what that

11:20.695 --> 11:21.776
difference is? Yes, you mean going back to grad 
school days? Yeah, basically. I mean, in grad

11:26.100 --> 11:30.144
school, I have to admit that I never really came 
across that many radio astronomers. Oh, there was

11:30.204 --> 11:36.711
Frank Lowe, and there was the odd, I mean... Rare. 
The rare radio astronomer that would come

11:36.891 --> 11:40.194
through. We did have one radio astronomer on the 
staff one official quote-unquote radio

11:43.837 --> 11:49.622
astronomer on the staff at the University of 
Arizona, and that was Andrei Paholchek. And he

11:50.663 --> 12:04.375
taught the course in radio astronomy, and I found 
radio astronomy to be much, much greater, much

11:50.663 --> 12:04.375
more intensity in real physics. That is, radio 
astronomers seem much more solidly based and

12:04.395 --> 12:12.342
solidly ground, if you will, in... in techniques 
and a theory of physics. The frustration, of

12:16.870 --> 12:23.099
course, with the radio astronomers, I found, of 
course, was that they didn't have any good angular

12:16.870 --> 12:23.099
resolution. They had instrumentation that they 
had to be extremely careful with. It seemed to me

12:26.224 --> 12:35.918
that radio astronomers knew a lot more about the 
inner workings of the computer than optical. I

12:36.018 --> 12:37.140
can't take that back. Optical astronomers 
generally knew a lot about their spectrographs.

12:41.245 --> 12:44.608
their polarimeters and photometers, because 
they had to make it work. Radio astronomers,

12:45.169 --> 12:56.039
however, had found the nice technique of relying 
upon a really high-quality staff of radio

12:45.169 --> 12:56.039
engineers and computer scientists. And so the 
actual astronomers really didn't know that much

12:56.079 --> 13:06.909
about the black boxes they were using, but the 
people that did made everything work exceedingly

12:56.079 --> 13:06.909
well. And at the NRIO, I noticed that most of the 
radio astronomers that I dealt with hardly ever

13:10.709 --> 13:16.718
would, they sort of looked down upon optical 
astronomy. They didn't care really what a

13:16.758 --> 13:22.327
spectral type was or what constellation or 
anything like that. They were really retooled

13:22.347 --> 13:29.398
physicists or retooled ham radio operators more 
than anything. Whereas optical astronomers

13:29.898 --> 13:37.510
tended to be types that got excited about 
astronomy from hands-on observing experiences

13:38.249 --> 13:41.372
when they were either in high school or college. 
And there was a rare optical astronomer who got

13:42.072 --> 13:53.482
into optical astronomy because they were good in 
physics and they were good in theory and then got

13:42.072 --> 13:53.482
pushed into optical astronomy. But in general, I 
thought the problems that radio astronomers were

13:53.523 --> 14:07.615
asking and were able to answer were a lot more 
in-depth in physics and global problems than

13:53.523 --> 14:07.615
optical astronomers were asking. Maybe that was 
naive, but that's my impression. Okay, so this

14:10.207 --> 14:17.997
year, early this year, I guess, you left Socorro, 
and where did you go? I left the, actually I left the

14:18.017 --> 14:28.991
NRAO, and I left Socorro both at the same time, and 
I'm now Executive Director of the Astronomical

14:18.017 --> 14:28.991
Society of the Pacific. And for me it's an ideal 
position because You know, I've sort of been a

14:32.418 --> 14:35.543
hybrid between optical and radio astronomy. I've 
never really put my solid foot down and said, this

14:35.583 --> 14:43.254
is my area, and I am pigeonholed forever. I just 
really get excited about all problems in

14:43.275 --> 14:53.350
astronomy, and I've always been involved with 
public outreach and public information since

14:43.275 --> 14:53.350
coming back to the NRAO. When I was in Chile, of 
course, I was working hand in in glove with all the

14:58.085 --> 15:00.068
visiting astronomers. So I got to see a broad 
perspective of the type of problems that

15:00.088 --> 15:05.777
everybody that came to the observatory was 
working on. And then when I came back to the U.S., I

15:06.478 --> 15:10.365
was involved with radio astronomy. So then I got a 
perspective of what it is to, what it means to be a

15:10.385 --> 15:21.342
millimeter wave astronomer or a centimeter wave 
astronomer or even a long wave astronomer and what

15:10.385 --> 15:21.342
the problems of resolution are and and different 
wavelength approaches to different problems.

15:25.708 --> 15:35.719
And so I found myself, you know, with quite a large 
global perspective that I guess I'm really now

15:25.708 --> 15:35.719
able to take advantage of in my dealings with the 
astronomical community. Why did you make this

15:36.100 --> 15:37.261
last jump? Was it because the opportunity was 
there? Basically, it was the opportunity was

15:39.704 --> 15:41.606
there. You know, Andy Fracknoy had been the 
executive director of the Astronomical Society

15:41.646 --> 15:49.075
of the Pacific for the last 14 years or so. And... I 
saw the advertisement in one of the, I think it was

15:51.410 --> 15:58.277
the AAS's job newsletter. I read the description, 
you know, it must be this, it must be that, and

15:59.078 --> 16:04.083
experience of this, experience of that. I said, 
you know, this is a job I can do. I can do all that

16:07.786 --> 16:09.028
stuff. I almost replied to that myself, and that 
would have been some competition, except that

16:09.388 --> 16:17.796
this NASA contract was already looking good. I 
see, I see. We already had word that we got it. And

16:22.780 --> 16:29.669
also, I have to add that it was more or less an 
opportunity for me to be my own boss, as it were.

16:29.869 --> 16:38.481
It's kind of hard to work year after year after 
year, sometimes having ideas that your boss

16:29.869 --> 16:38.481
doesn't necessarily share, enthusiasm, 
support, and so on. And now, in this position, I can

16:39.121 --> 16:42.766
sort of make it or break it. I can pave new ground if I 
really get enough energy up to do it. So you've done

16:48.654 --> 16:51.758
optical, you've done radio, and now you have... I 
have to do everything. I have to do everything.

16:54.272 --> 16:58.437
Which is one of the reasons I want to interview, 
because I'm going to start asking you some

16:54.272 --> 16:58.437
questions now today.

17:02.903 --> 17:16.339
How important do you think NASA money was to 
helping astronomy in general, and planetary

17:02.903 --> 17:16.339
astronomy in particular,

17:02.903 --> 17:16.339
take off? Well, I don't know where to begin to 
answer that question, of course. For NASA, to

17:21.978 --> 17:44.779
answer about the importance of NASA money to 
astronomy in general, I'd say that the

17:21.978 --> 17:44.779
educational opportunities that NASA money 
afforded to people like me, even though I never

17:21.978 --> 17:44.779
ended up in planetary astronomy, the research 
that I did never really affected any of the NASA

17:21.978 --> 17:44.779
missions. It was really invaluable at the time 
because I was able to go through graduate study

17:45.248 --> 17:57.339
with a school without worrying about teaching 
assistants or outside jobs or what have you. Of

17:58.500 --> 18:15.036
course, I've seen the NASA money and the support 
that it provided to the, I guess it was the Mount

17:58.500 --> 18:15.036
Lemmon 61-inch telescope and all the research 
work that got done there.

18:15.488 --> 18:18.210
You know, the telescope on Mauna Kea. There's a 
NASA telescope there, infrared facility.

18:23.835 --> 18:24.256
There's two. There's the 88-inch and the IRT. 
That's right, that's right. And I think, in

18:28.019 --> 18:43.172
hindsight, I would say NASA probably could have 
put more money in ground support to some of their

18:28.019 --> 18:43.172
missions than they did. I mean, it's always... 
Ground support has always been looked upon by the

18:45.728 --> 18:56.058
people in national centers as only funded by the 
National Science Foundation. The question has

18:57.540 --> 19:10.673
always been raised, for example, how much impact 
will the space telescope or any of the other

18:57.540 --> 19:10.673
NASA-funded orbiting telescopes have on 
ground-based facilities? And should NSF worry

19:15.689 --> 19:24.261
about having to fund more ground support and so on? 
I mean, you get the idea that I

19:24.282 --> 19:40.845
think we've always worried about is

19:24.282 --> 19:40.845
the demand for ground support going to overwhelm 
the telescopes on the ground once we get all these

19:41.787 --> 19:47.033
observations from space. And I think the answer 
has been sort of halfway between the real terror

19:47.433 --> 19:57.424
and the optimism. I mean,

19:57.504 --> 20:07.035
my opinion has always been that, hey, there's only 
24 hours in a day and there's a limited number of

19:57.504 --> 20:07.035
astronomers. And if they're off getting X-ray 
data, they don't have time to be getting radio data

20:07.471 --> 20:14.922
from the ground or optical data from the ground. 
There's no doubt that every single space

20:14.942 --> 20:28.402
observatory that has returned data has changed 
the character of the proposals that have been

20:14.942 --> 20:28.402
submitted to the ground-based support . I mean, 
for example, back in 1983, when IRS data started

20:29.303 --> 20:36.634
coming down, the 12-meter telescope probably had 
like 40, 50 percent of its proposals for the next

20:37.542 --> 20:51.426
three or four years were always mentioning IRS 
data this and IRS data this and we're following up

20:37.542 --> 20:51.426
this from IRS and that from IRS. Basically, the 
number of proposals did not overall to the

20:52.228 --> 20:56.916
telescope didn't increase. The character of the 
proposals changed because researchers were

20:57.156 --> 21:02.706
getting data from infrared and now they wanted to 
That's exactly parallel in planetary

21:03.007 --> 21:09.361
ground-based observing every time a probe goes 
by. Exactly. One question before I forget here,

21:11.707 --> 21:15.415
because I skipped the lore on a little bit. 30 years 
ago, if we'd be in an AAS meeting, there'd just be

21:16.136 --> 21:19.885
one AAS meeting. Everybody would be in here. Now, 
you don't see many planetary papers. You don't see

21:25.900 --> 21:27.403
many solar papers. We've got all these divisions, 
high energy, astrophysics, solar astronomy,

21:27.523 --> 21:36.296
planetary astronomy, historical astronomy. And 
some of them have their own specialized journals

21:37.819 --> 21:40.803
now. In addition, in the old days, it was APJ, AJ, 
and PASB. Publications of the Astronomical

21:47.373 --> 21:49.737
Society of the Pacific. Do you think these 
subdivisions of the AAS have been good or bad, or

21:50.155 --> 22:02.747
just inevitable?

22:02.827 --> 22:19.082
I think you put the nail on the head when you said 
inevitable, because the general expansion of the

22:02.827 --> 22:19.082
field makes it, I mean, even the American Physical 
Society just cannot have a general meeting where

22:02.827 --> 22:19.082
everybody exchanges information in a worthwhile 
manner. on a broad diversity of topics. I mean, as

22:23.184 --> 22:49.677
much as I, in the astronomical side of the Pacific, 
feel that the public needs to be exposed to a broad

22:23.184 --> 22:49.677
range of topics in a general sense, you know, solar 
astronomy, planetary astronomy,

22:23.184 --> 22:49.677
extra-gallactic astronomy, and all the 
wavelength and so on, and it's good to meld them all

22:23.184 --> 22:49.677
into one sort of uniform picture, at the detailed 
professional level, where you're talking

22:23.184 --> 22:49.677
researcher to researcher, The meetings, 
especially the division meetings, extremely

22:49.960 --> 22:58.733
important that they're talking on the same 
topics. You would totally dilute the effort if you

22:58.773 --> 23:05.443
were to mix extragalactic types with the division 
meetings. The data transmission rate would be

23:05.463 --> 23:08.107
very low. On the other hand, it's also very 
important, a very important part of these

23:08.327 --> 23:14.196
meetings is to have the overall survey talk, 
you'll find a very high percentage of the members

23:14.497 --> 23:31.417
of the AAS are younger graduate students or people 
that are in academic positions where they're

23:14.497 --> 23:31.417
teaching on all subjects. And for them to have a 
broad perspective of what's going on in planetary

23:31.437 --> 23:40.948
science or X-ray astronomy or high energy 
astrophysics or you name it. In this meeting it

23:40.968 --> 23:44.352
seems to be extreme ultraviolet astronomy. And in 
other meetings it's been IRAS, and sometimes it's

23:44.618 --> 23:49.807
the Ultraviolet Astro Program. It's essential to 
have these overviews sort of cycle around all the

23:50.568 --> 24:09.360
disciplines in astronomy so that your younger 
folks or your people that are teaching general

23:50.568 --> 24:09.360
courses and so on have a good perspective of the big 
picture. chop it up so little that planetary

24:09.965 --> 24:14.453
sciences only go to planetary science meetings. 
It's not fair. Do you think planetary astronomy is

24:17.678 --> 24:20.083
part of astronomy? Do I think it's part of 
astronomy? That's a good question. I think it is

24:25.111 --> 24:27.896
part of astronomy. But I'm asking myself, why do I 
think it's part of astronomy? We use telescopes.

24:36.357 --> 24:37.278
That's right. Planetary scientists use 
telescopes. Some of them use space probes,

24:39.400 --> 24:44.365
however, which are not really telescopes. It's 
more like a remote geologist. You may have too much

24:48.649 --> 24:51.392
knowledge to answer, so let me ask you this. You're 
the big cheese at the PASP, and you ought to have

24:51.412 --> 24:58.059
your finger on the pulse of this. Do you think the 
public believes planetary astronomy is part of

24:58.079 --> 25:02.083
astronomy? Oh, yes. Oh, yes. There's no doubt 
about that. When people ask general questions

25:06.547 --> 25:18.088
about astronomy or what draws them into the 
interest of astronomy overall, one very

25:06.547 --> 25:18.088
important part is planetary. After all, that's 
what you can show them in a small telescope.

25:21.394 --> 25:28.386
Granted, they're going to ask questions about the 
Big Bang or search for extraterrestrial

25:21.394 --> 25:28.386
intelligence. Let's not forget that the search 
for extraterrestrial intelligence is related to

25:28.602 --> 25:33.607
planetary systems. And the more we know about our 
planetary systems, for example, at the ASP, the

25:34.248 --> 25:52.425
questions I get from the press or radio and 
television stations, they increase enormously

25:34.248 --> 25:52.425
during the time when we have a lunar eclipse, a 
solar eclipse, a close cometary approach, a

25:34.248 --> 25:52.425
meteor shower. I mean, these are things that the 
public can easily identify because they can

25:52.625 --> 25:57.310
easily see them. So from the public's 
perspective, planetary astronomy may be the only

25:57.695 --> 26:04.704
part of astronomy they ever come in contact with. 
You think, you know, we've had 30 years and now we

26:05.565 --> 26:15.177
can see details on Jupiter that we never saw, rings 
around other planets than Saturn, Mars, pictures

26:05.565 --> 26:15.177
in the surface. Do you think that's had any effect 
on the public? I mean, has it changed the way they

26:17.460 --> 26:24.248
look at things or their interests in planetary 
astronomy, astronomy and science in general? Or

26:24.268 --> 26:25.930
is it a passing fact? You know, I think we have to be 
careful to answer a question like that because I

26:28.272 --> 26:49.103
think that the space program in general and also 
the

26:28.272 --> 26:49.103
detailed information that comes from the space 
probes about other planets in the solar system has

26:28.272 --> 26:49.103
made the public almost take things for granted. I 
remember when I was in high school or when you were

26:50.365 --> 26:53.149
in school, You know, one space probe, one space 
launch was a fantastic event. Nowadays, we have

26:58.932 --> 27:03.576
shuttles get set up every month or two, and no big 
deal. We don't go through the countdown. We don't

27:05.298 --> 27:07.059
hear anything in the news. You know, we know 
they're up there. We take it for granted that

27:08.641 --> 27:10.603
they're doing good stuff. And another space probe 
goes by. I mean, Voyager was a big deal, no doubt

27:13.265 --> 27:15.267
about it. But, you know, does the public get 
excited about another telescope getting

27:17.549 --> 27:20.892
launched? Astronomers make lots of noise about 
it. And the amount of information that comes from

27:22.965 --> 27:28.990
that new telescope can be overwhelming. There's 
just so much data coming down. But the public is

27:31.733 --> 27:41.062
sort of getting

27:31.733 --> 27:41.062
blase about the whole thing and taking things for 
granted. Here's a question you don't have to be a

27:41.342 --> 27:44.425
planetary astronomer to answer. But you have to 
know something about astronomy and the funding

27:44.465 --> 27:50.271
end and all that. and the public interest in. In 30 
years now, we've looked all over the solar system,

27:51.645 --> 28:03.419
haven't yet found a trace of present or previous 
life anywhere except Earth. In particular, no

28:03.439 --> 28:06.443
green men on Mars, not even a bug. Sure. Do you think 
that's had a negative effect on public interest

28:07.524 --> 28:11.349
funding or not? No, I don't think so. I really don't 
think so. Why don't I think so? That's a good

28:18.277 --> 28:19.178
question. I mean, I think the search is fun. And the 
questions always come down from the press or from

28:23.172 --> 28:29.922
people that don't know a lot of details about the 
types of search and so on. Have you found it? Part of

28:32.966 --> 28:44.743
the problem that the scientist has in 
communicating science to the public

28:45.635 --> 28:55.568
is related to their desire to know the biggest or 
the smallest, the most distant or the closest, the

28:45.635 --> 28:55.568
oldest or the youngest, or what's the latest 
discovery. I mean, they think science is made up of

28:55.588 --> 29:04.560
just eureka discoveries, and they don't really 
understand the scientific curiosity process. So

29:06.382 --> 29:08.905
I think there's an interest, you know, in the 
public. If you say that you're looking for

29:09.086 --> 29:14.072
extraterrestrial intelligence or you're 
looking for life in the solar system, And that's

29:14.322 --> 29:17.086
always a motivation to get the public interested. 
They're always going to ask you, did you find it?

29:19.910 --> 29:39.317
But

29:19.910 --> 29:39.317
part of the challenge of being a scientist is to 
give

29:19.910 --> 29:39.317
the public more appreciation for the fact that 
it's the hunt that's most important. It's the

29:39.820 --> 29:43.546
thrill of the hunt, and that continues no matter 
what you find. You open more unanswered doors than

29:44.107 --> 29:54.725
you do, you know, you always ask more questions 
after you've made an experiment than you answer.

29:54.805 --> 29:55.586
It's just amazing. Here's a two-part question. 
One, do you think astronomers in general have done

29:57.289 --> 30:06.064
a good job, or as good a job as they could have been, 
in selling themselves to the public and to the

29:57.289 --> 30:06.064
Congress? And then I'm going to be specific and 
say, I believe that the radio astronomers have

30:08.069 --> 30:23.755
always done their infighting behind closed 
doors, spilled the blood there, and come out

30:08.069 --> 30:23.755
charging with a unified front, whereas the 
optical astronomers do all their internecine

30:08.069 --> 30:23.755
strife on the stage. So Perot, Kahn, what do you 
think? Getting astronomers, or getting

30:29.146 --> 30:45.808
scientists in general, but the scientists I know 
best are astronomers, and getting astronomers to

30:29.146 --> 30:45.808
be forthright and to participate in public 
outreach programs is a mixed bag. There's about, I

30:45.848 --> 30:54.580
would say, like 10% of the astronomers on the staff 
of major research facilities that are really

30:45.848 --> 30:54.580
willing to be science for judges or to give tours to 
observatories and so on. I think it's a lot

31:00.632 --> 31:10.105
different when you get to the academic community 
because their people are constantly dealing with

31:00.632 --> 31:10.105
students and the public and so the percentage 
there probably is much higher. I think and on that

31:12.308 --> 31:20.179
basis I would say astronomers really haven't done 
a good job but I mean how many astronomers do you

31:12.308 --> 31:20.179
need to have out there One Carl Sagan is worth 
10,000 other astronomers. And so it's kind of hard

31:25.826 --> 31:27.789
to answer that question. Now, related to the 
question of optical versus radio, I think you have

31:27.809 --> 31:33.797
to be very, very careful.

31:35.360 --> 31:49.339
Because radio astronomers have always been 
really totally dependent very soon after the

31:35.360 --> 31:49.339
beginning of radio astronomy. Radio astronomy 
actually began in the 1930s and really wasn't

31:49.859 --> 31:57.409
going full force until the 1950s after the war. And 
very soon thereafter was the creation of national

31:57.630 --> 32:01.935
observatories. So radio astronomers have 
always, not always, but for the most part, have

32:01.955 --> 32:10.627
been using national facilities. You just know 
they cannot spend the money at a local university

32:10.788 --> 32:17.757
to build an instrument big enough, so it's been 
national facilities. And it's a much smaller

32:18.142 --> 32:27.434
population of scientists, let's say probably 
between 10% and 20% of the number of optical

32:18.142 --> 32:27.434
astronomers. And so the people to do the fighting 
are fewer. The efficiency of getting telescope

32:33.762 --> 32:45.617
time for the members of the community because of 
the existence of large national centers like

32:33.762 --> 32:45.617
Arecibo and NRAO and so on, and some major 
university facilities like Owens Valley and so

32:46.205 --> 32:51.131
on. It's much more successful for radio 
astronomers to get telescope time. Optical

32:58.019 --> 33:02.804
astronomers, on the other hand, they come from a 
different community at the outset.

33:03.325 --> 33:13.057
Historically, they grew up in large private 
telescopes like Lick and Mount Palomar and so on.

33:13.097 --> 33:15.199
And so they were in-house type astronomers. And 
only over the course of the last three

33:15.685 --> 33:29.706
decades, so to speak, since the NSF was founded, 
have you gotten astronomers spread out far and

33:15.685 --> 33:29.706
wide at small schools and large schools and 
everywhere. And they don't have their own

33:29.726 --> 33:32.851
telescopes. And so there's the in-group, the 
people that have their own private, as it were,

33:32.871 --> 33:44.629
major facility, University of Texas, Caltech, 
Those big places, Arizona and so on, and those

33:45.335 --> 33:54.165
people are sort of the upper cream, the best 
scientists there always have lots of telescope

33:45.335 --> 33:54.165
time. And you've got the other community out there 
fighting for telescope time because they don't

33:54.686 --> 34:00.974
have their own telescopes that are there. It seems 
to be a much, for one thing it's a much larger

34:03.076 --> 34:08.963
community, I'd like to say before probably a 
factor of 10 higher. and there's not enough

34:09.685 --> 34:19.078
national facility telescope time to go around for 
this large mass of scientists that are groping for

34:09.685 --> 34:19.078
time. So they tend probably, you know, when it 
comes right down to it, it's easy to say, you know,

34:19.478 --> 34:35.119
you iron your difficulties out in private, but 
there's always somebody that walks away feeling

34:19.478 --> 34:35.119
hurt whenever you have a discussion about whether 
planetary science is better than, extragalactic

34:35.453 --> 34:39.765
or ultraviolet is better than x-ray and so on. 
Somebody... In that connection, planetary

34:40.547 --> 34:44.177
astronomy is really half and half. It shares some 
characteristics with both. But what I'm thinking

34:46.062 --> 34:48.248
of, for example, a 10-year recommendation 
reports come together. The radio astronomers

34:50.270 --> 34:53.873
seem to pick one thing and stick with it. Planetary 
astronomers pick one thing and stick with it. And

34:56.475 --> 35:03.943
the stellar and galactic and extra-galactic 
optical astronomers keep right on fighting even

34:56.475 --> 35:03.943
after it comes out. It seems like it. It always 
seems that way. It does seem that way. But I can tell

35:06.885 --> 35:10.629
you that there's plenty of hurt people in the radio 
community, too. Although they came together and

35:10.729 --> 35:17.155
endorsed VLBA, back in the early 80s. And lo and 
behold, the darn thing is constructed now because

35:20.456 --> 35:28.286
it was a project that was ready to go when the 
funding became available. There are also a lot of

35:30.508 --> 35:37.177
hurt people in the radio community that were 
hoping for a 25-millimeter wave dish. It never

35:37.717 --> 35:38.438
happened. And the NRAO is ready to go with a 
millimeter array. I don't know if it'll ever

35:44.466 --> 35:45.707
happen. And gradually the astronomers at some of 
the major universities have started to build

35:46.177 --> 35:53.950
their own millimeter array. Millimeter 
astronomers have basically felt like they've

35:53.970 --> 35:58.719
been left off. And it's an extremely powerful 
field. Lately, a lot of astronomers, and we're

36:07.034 --> 36:30.258
talking optical, radio, planetary, stellar, 
have been getting a lot of publicity and evidently

36:07.034 --> 36:30.258
some money off of projects that get a lot of public 
play, like search for extraterrestrial

36:07.034 --> 36:30.258
intelligence, killer asteroids, search for 
other solar systems, ozone holes in the Earth's

36:07.034 --> 36:30.258
atmosphere. Do you think they're overdoing that 
or not? I think the public is extremely interested

36:34.042 --> 36:36.805
in these type of projects, and it's good that they 
get press. I think astronomers have to be careful

36:41.380 --> 36:54.433
to spread the press out to, and I think the AAS does a 
real good job, and Steve Moran in the press office,

36:41.380 --> 36:54.433
in getting the press interested in other ongoing 
critical issues in astronomy. You have to

36:54.473 --> 37:04.362
remember that some of those topics in modern 
astronomy are pretty esoteric and hard to

36:54.473 --> 37:04.362
describe to the public, so killer asteroids and 
SETI and all those you know planetary stuff that's

37:04.848 --> 37:24.628
when one respect planetary science has an 
advantage it's easier to communicate the problem

37:04.848 --> 37:24.628
to the public i don't think we can i don't think we 
can really overdo communicating the public

37:04.848 --> 37:24.628
however and what's good for planetary scientists 
in the short run because their project is

37:25.199 --> 37:28.363
described well to the press. It's good for 
astronomers in general. Whether it's planetary,

37:30.526 --> 37:35.293
radio, or optical, I think probably all in the same 
bathtub. I mean, all in the same boat. And is the

37:36.975 --> 37:40.260
boat sailing along nicely? Is it dead in the water? 
Or is it sinking in general as far as, say, funding

37:41.722 --> 37:53.097
goes and stuff like that?

37:53.347 --> 37:54.489
Well, I don't know. I have to be careful. Not 
necessarily just funding, because we know that's

37:55.850 --> 37:58.534
dead in the water. But what do you think? Use your 
crystal ball. I mean, I've always felt that

38:02.740 --> 38:13.114
we tend to get too greedy. We tend to get a major 
facility and then milk it to death for data. And

38:23.958 --> 38:25.039
we're never satisfied. There's another facility 
we just have to have, another facility we just have

38:25.059 --> 38:28.644
to have. And admittedly, it is a complex area 
because you always need more resolution. You

38:33.530 --> 38:35.172
always need a different wavelength coverage. And 
the problems nowadays are not simply focused in

38:35.712 --> 38:42.721
what you can get out of the ultraviolet data or what 
you can get out of the infrared data. You have to put

38:42.841 --> 38:46.405
the whole thing together in one big 
multi-wavelength picture. And astronomers know

38:46.655 --> 38:52.304
you need 20 telescopes and not just one. And 
Congress wonders, well, jeez, I just gave you one.

38:55.669 --> 38:59.154
Why do you need another one? But is the situation 
healthy? I think that in terms of our ability to do

39:03.581 --> 39:14.417
research, let's say the ability to gather the data 
that we need, the situation is extremely healthy.

39:14.937 --> 39:26.053
The question on an individual basis, for an 
individual, can an individual exist at a

39:14.937 --> 39:26.053
university or make a career, you know, there's a 
threat there. There's a threat there because the

39:26.073 --> 39:31.580
funding, the instruments are there, the data is 
there for the best people. The question is what

39:31.981 --> 39:35.526
about the middle pack? Is there enough funding to 
attract the brightest students into the field, to

39:39.811 --> 39:45.979
keep them into the field, and so on. And I think the 
situation there is of great concern. The number of

39:49.964 --> 39:56.753
PhDs that are generated is like a factor of three or 
four at least, more than the number of real jobs.

39:57.634 --> 39:58.655
And that's a concern. That's not healthy in the 
long term. On the other hand, should there be a

40:03.200 --> 40:14.893
continuous growth in the number of PhDs that are 
created in a field like astronomy, I think we have

40:03.200 --> 40:14.893
to reach a steady state. Otherwise, there won't be 
any archaeologists left, and there won't be any

40:14.913 --> 40:20.379
new farmers, and so on. I think one indicator of 
public interest and the public taxpayer's

40:20.739 --> 40:30.490
willingness to support, give money to astronomy, 
Are the fortunes of the Astronomical Society of

40:31.027 --> 40:37.299
the Pacific, how are those doing now? Well, the 
Astronomical Society of the Pacific has always

40:37.319 --> 40:47.678
had great success in its programs, primarily 
because it addresses issues in education.

40:48.400 --> 40:54.030
There's a vast pool of teachers out there that need 
help. and information on astronomy and the way to

40:54.584 --> 40:58.690
teach it to kids and so on. Teachers that have not 
had any formal training themselves and sometimes

40:58.751 --> 41:06.142
not even formal training in science. The ASP has 
extremely successful summer meetings that have

41:07.244 --> 41:22.448
just grown by leaps and bounds in communicating 
science in a very popular way and also addressing

41:07.244 --> 41:22.448
some professional scientific topics as well as 
teacher workshops and so on. The problem that the

41:23.069 --> 41:41.072
ASB has is one that most nonprofit societies face 
at one time or another, and that's the bottom line

41:23.069 --> 41:41.072
in terms of getting the funds it requires just to 
keep operating. I mean, it's a small society. Its

41:45.658 --> 41:51.726
historical base is regional.

41:53.056 --> 42:10.037
It's so broad that

41:53.056 --> 42:10.037
it has been hard in the recent past to actually 
attract funds, I guess, basically, in terms of

41:53.056 --> 42:10.037
there's no real strong corporate support. Those 
are some of the goals that I have in getting strong

42:12.020 --> 42:21.932
corporate support and getting the programs 
underwritten

42:22.486 --> 42:31.636
by funding agencies, people that are interested 
in education, and getting more professional

42:22.486 --> 42:31.636
involvement in the society.

42:35.921 --> 42:47.734
Some people join the society, and after a year or 
two, they realize that they come to the conclusion

42:35.921 --> 42:47.734
that they're not getting enough out of society to 
continue being members. And my answer to them is,

42:48.794 --> 42:52.337
hey, listen, the society is made up of you. You 
maybe don't have enough time to go out and talk to

42:53.158 --> 43:03.669
your local school classes or to give a public 
lecture and so on. But as a scientist, as an

43:04.109 --> 43:17.502
astronomer, you should give some strong support 
and backing to those people in the scientific

43:04.109 --> 43:17.502
community who are willing to do the outreach 
programs that you basically should be morally

43:18.241 --> 43:28.070
obligated to support because you're getting 
support from the public. And so you've got to give

43:28.130 --> 43:29.131
something back. Some people just don't like to do 
that. So why not join the society and let the

43:30.733 --> 43:36.458
society do it for them and speak strongly with one 
voice? So the society is in a great state of change

43:37.399 --> 43:47.488
right now in terms of expansion, in terms of 
seeking funding support, and in terms of the type

43:47.772 --> 43:58.390
of programs we want to get into, I have no doubt that 
we'll succeed in all this. This doesn't have

43:59.500 --> 44:02.785
anything to do with the history of planetary 
astronomy, but I've got to ask you. The very name,

44:04.006 --> 44:08.593
Astronaut of the Pacific, implies regional. We 
don't want to be just regional anymore. I'm

44:11.057 --> 44:13.780
thinking of changing the name. That question was 
put to me originally when I got interested in

44:14.201 --> 44:19.449
society. I looked at it and I said, yeah, you're 
right. The name is a detriment when somebody back

44:21.992 --> 44:26.098
in Georgia goes to their dean and says they're 
going to publish a paper in the PASP. He says, why

44:30.542 --> 44:32.004
the PASP? Why not the PASA? If there's such a 
journal. Or if you go to the University of Florida

44:38.773 --> 44:47.524
and say you want to have a meeting of the ASP in 
Florida, they're going to say, who's the ASP? But

44:50.581 --> 44:54.286
You have to remember the society is a real 
venerable society. It's been around for over 100

44:54.346 --> 44:56.089
years. There's a very strong following here on the 
West Coast and in several of the states in the U.S.

44:56.569 --> 45:07.264
And we even have members from 70 foreign 
countries. There are plenty of other

45:08.106 --> 45:11.951
organizations that exist with strange names. It 
just makes it a little bit more of a challenge, a

45:12.592 --> 45:16.217
little more of a challenge challenge to do our I 
don't really feel that it's a time to upset the

45:16.383 --> 45:26.187
apple cart by making a name change. A new director 
and a new name change? No, no, no. We'll exist with

45:29.956 --> 45:32.282
our own name, with our old name.
