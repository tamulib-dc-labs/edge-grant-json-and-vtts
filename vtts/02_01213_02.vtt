WEBVTT

00:03.895 --> 00:28.459
Another of the things that I thought would do well 
to discuss, and that you've been quite analytical

00:03.895 --> 00:28.459
of the situation all through the years, it just 
does help a whole lot to be bound together in

00:03.895 --> 00:28.459
association where we can learn not only the 
technological things, but learn how to get along

00:03.895 --> 00:28.459
together and with each other and to promote 
veterinary medicine for the benefit of the

00:03.895 --> 00:28.459
public. As an active person all through these 
years, I'm sure you espoused those views. Yes,

00:38.168 --> 00:57.810
that was

00:38.168 --> 00:57.810
one thing that we as board members were made to 
realize that that was our primary purpose was to

00:38.168 --> 00:57.810
benefit the public. And I appeared before the 
Sunset Commission at the last two or three years,

01:04.831 --> 01:11.739
three years ago, four years ago, I guess, when the 
veterinary board came under review. And that was

01:13.201 --> 01:22.491
the time that they proposed to put lay people on the 
veterinary board, examining board. And it was, to

01:24.433 --> 01:32.863
me, I think it was a mistake, but The legislature 
didn't seem to think so, and we did wind up with two

01:34.953 --> 01:39.579
members. But,

01:40.781 --> 02:00.088
you know, you have to have gone through a 
veterinary school to appreciate what we can do and

01:40.781 --> 02:00.088
the services that we do render. And what needs to be 
done. Yeah.

02:07.083 --> 02:18.538
It's just, I think the name of the game, as far as I'm 
concerned, is your client-veterinary

02:07.083 --> 02:18.538
relationship. That's just my feeling of it, and 
you can't get away from it. And I've seen so many

02:23.324 --> 02:36.702
newer graduates that, and I'm not setting myself 
up as an example, but so many newer graduates that

02:23.324 --> 02:36.702
the only thing they're looking for is the dollar. 
And it's, there's more to it than that.

02:45.564 --> 03:06.773
For, I can't help but notice some of their 
veterinarians as they've gone through the

02:45.564 --> 03:06.773
practice career, the ones who've just made an 
adequate living seem to be just as happy as many of

02:45.564 --> 03:06.773
those who have

02:45.564 --> 03:06.773
made a greater amount of money, so. Yeah. Well, 
very few, very few veterinarians ever got rich

03:11.045 --> 03:16.571
practicing veterinary medicine. A small 
percentage of them.

03:21.136 --> 03:24.620
The ones that got that made it on the... They made it 
on investments or some outside interest. On the

03:27.864 --> 03:28.705
side, yes. One of the things that I thought, since 
you've been around quite a while, is to discuss

03:35.913 --> 03:39.538
some of the acquaintances that you've known in 
veterinary medicine through the years. One of

03:40.440 --> 03:49.774
those grand people that we don't hear about and 
used to be secretary of the TVMA back in the early

03:40.440 --> 03:49.774
days was Dr. Marsteller. What are your 
recollections of Dr. Marsteller? Well, of

03:54.361 --> 03:59.108
course, he was dean when I went to school, say, at 
A&M. He was the dean. And I thought Dr. Marsteller

04:01.917 --> 04:05.340
was a very fine man. He was always receptive to any 
problems that I had. And

04:11.867 --> 04:22.938
I felt free to go in any time and just ask him 
anything that I wanted, and his door was always

04:11.867 --> 04:22.938
open. And he was a fine man. He was a very dedicated 
person.

04:31.178 --> 04:36.625
He was secretary back in the times when your dad was 
very active in the association. Did you ever hear

04:36.645 --> 04:40.389
your dad talk about him in the association? Oh, 
yeah. My dad and Dr. Marsteller were real close

04:41.230 --> 04:45.535
friends. And I first got to know him when my dad 
would go down for short courses at A&M during the

04:45.555 --> 04:53.305
summer. And I would go with him and got to know Dr. 
Marsteller.

05:01.435 --> 05:04.820
I'd stay over at the horse barn with Owen Garrigan. 
I don't know whether you ever knew Owen Garrigan or

05:04.860 --> 05:07.423
not. He was the greatest horseman that ever left 
A&M. And he had charge of all the horse barn, all the

05:12.430 --> 05:20.682
horses, and I'd stay over there with him a lot. And 
later on, when I went to school, I got me a job over

05:22.424 --> 05:29.434
there working for him. I didn't care about, of 
course, I needed the money, but he forgot more

05:31.844 --> 05:39.114
about horses than most people down there ever 
knew. He was a wonderful Scotchman, and he was a

05:39.554 --> 05:47.985
wonderful horseman.

05:48.005 --> 05:48.446
Wonderful. There's another man I thought I'd ask 
you about. During the World War I years, Dr. N.F.

05:57.778 --> 05:58.459
Williams was president for three years. You know, 
he spanned the war years. Did either you or your

06:03.252 --> 06:07.057
father have a personal acquaintance with him? No, 
I never had any acquaintance. I was never

06:09.820 --> 06:13.204
acquainted with Dr. Williams. Was he in vet 
school? He was in the ag department, wasn't he? No,

06:17.930 --> 06:21.074
he was a veterinarian in practice. I forget just 
where he practiced. But when the Two associations

06:25.810 --> 06:29.675
came together again after they'd been separated 
for four years. He seemed to be oil on troubled

06:30.656 --> 06:35.062
waters, and that's why I thought it had something 
to do with it. No, I've never heard his name

06:35.082 --> 06:36.844
mentioned. If I have, I've forgotten it. Okay. 
Another person who really worked hard stayed

06:39.948 --> 06:45.815
mostly in the laboratory, but he did get out 
around. I know I saw him in a lot of the veterinary

06:45.875 --> 06:48.819
meetings and so forth. Just to see him was Dr. 
Hubert Schmidt. Did you see much of him? I worked

06:53.669 --> 07:05.163
with Dr. Schmidt when I was in school, and he was 
working on X disease.

07:05.183 --> 07:06.504
Are you familiar with that? It's a toxic disease, 
is that correct? Yes. He did a lot of research on

07:08.727 --> 07:10.449
that.

07:13.172 --> 07:17.257
You might tell us the etiology of that while you're 
on it. Somebody might hear this and didn't know

07:17.577 --> 07:20.000
what it was even. Well, it was a Actually, it was 
caused from lubricant that was used in making

07:22.595 --> 07:33.389
these range pellets.

07:33.409 --> 07:43.863
And the first that I saw it, the first case I had, I

07:33.409 --> 07:43.863
didn't know what it was. It was just

07:43.963 --> 07:50.712
the cows, the cattle, their muzzle, Those would 
just crust up and be red just like it was a

07:51.029 --> 07:58.338
photosensitization. They're utter, all the 
light spots. And it was caused from chlorinated

08:02.263 --> 08:17.222
naphthalenes in the lubricant that was also 
lubricants that was used on farm machinery. I

08:18.080 --> 08:20.102
think Texaco was involved in it. I know Trader's 
Mill in Fort Worth was involved in it. And

08:24.808 --> 08:42.167
incidentally, they are to be complimented 
because they paid every claim I guess that was

08:24.808 --> 08:42.167
presented to them without any...

08:24.808 --> 08:42.167
Was Dr. Schmidt the one that finally came up with 
the solution?

08:45.331 --> 08:46.332
I think so. I think you did. I know he did more 
research on X disease than anyone else that I know

08:48.409 --> 08:56.156
of.

08:59.059 --> 09:08.728
I know I had one client that came to me and had lost 86

08:59.059 --> 09:08.728
head of cattle. And the only way that I diagnosed it 
or knew what it was while I was I took one of the tags

09:17.412 --> 09:45.799
from a feed sack in his barn and I don't know I stuck 
it in my pocket and he had told me that his wife had

09:17.412 --> 09:45.799
never lost any hadn't lost any cattle with this and 
I said well how do you account for that he said I

09:17.412 --> 09:45.799
don't know but he said she won't buy she won't buy 
feed from the same people I buy from

09:17.412 --> 09:45.799
so I guess that little spark or something i got back 
to my office and i called dr star i believe in

09:46.505 --> 10:12.124
gainful and i see star i believe i believe it's dr 
star and i said doctor i said who are these people

09:46.505 --> 10:12.124
that you're having losses from who are they buying 
their feed from and he's kind of hesitant to tell

09:46.505 --> 10:12.124
him And finally he told me who it was. I said, well, 
it's the same place mine's coming from. And that, I

10:17.586 --> 10:33.627
think, was to, as far as I was concerned, was the 
source of the problem.

10:33.647 --> 10:40.896
Who were the other people of prominence that you 
felt came along that deserve mention through the

10:33.647 --> 10:40.896
years? Well, Dr. Phil Mockford practiced here in 
Greenville. He was the first class that graduated

10:46.103 --> 10:48.527
from A&M. He just died a couple of years ago. And he 
was quite prominent with the State Association.

10:58.561 --> 10:59.903
Was that in 1920? What? The first class that 
graduated from A&M? I don't remember the date. I

11:06.071 --> 11:08.835
know he was in the first class. There were only...

11:14.322 --> 11:16.104
There were very few graduates from it. Someone 
told me that no one in that class ever went into

11:16.144 --> 11:22.771
practice, but that can't be true. He did. No, 
that's not true. Dr. Mockford, right?

11:27.796 --> 11:28.917
M-O-G-F-O-R-D? M-O-C-K-F-O-R-D. Oh, 
M-O-C-K-F-O-R-D. J. Phil. J. Phil Mockford. And

11:36.444 --> 11:39.247
I've seen pictures of that class somewhere. I 
don't remember. There were eight of them, weren't

11:40.208 --> 11:42.711
there? Something like that, yeah.

11:47.212 --> 12:05.098
I

11:47.212 --> 12:05.098
feel that Dr. Al Price needs a big pat on the back for 
getting

11:47.212 --> 12:05.098
the physical plant enlarged at A&M and so forth. 
They were kind of cramped over there where they

12:05.118 --> 12:08.263
originally were. Yeah, Al stepped in at a good time 
and did a real fine job. He's to be commended for it.

12:19.192 --> 12:20.534
He deserves a lot of credit. He was a classmate of 
mine.

12:26.620 --> 12:43.037
I couldn't help but feel that in the examining 
board, compared to the mild situations that used

12:26.620 --> 12:43.037
to be, there weren't too many cases to follow up on, 
and the examinations were relatively...

12:43.608 --> 13:12.653
homegrown now you've got to coordinate with the 
national board and all that sort of thing the

12:43.608 --> 13:12.653
examination board work has become much more 
complex in the last 15 years has it not yeah and i was

12:43.608 --> 13:12.653
i was in the middle of that too tell us about that 
well the professional examination service is the

12:43.608 --> 13:12.653
is the mother of the national exam and they wanted 
to well the first meeting that I went to after I was

13:13.223 --> 13:43.180
we had what's called the American Association of 
State Boards which are members from state boards

13:13.223 --> 13:43.180
from each state and the National Examination 
Service wasn't giving us the service that we felt

13:13.223 --> 13:43.180
we should have they had repeat questions and they 
had a bank of questions that were antiquated

13:44.020 --> 13:49.465
questions that you wouldn't believe were still 
there and this was back in 1970. So

13:49.545 --> 13:56.311
T.D. Weaver deserves more credit for than anyone 
else for the work that was done to to improve the

13:56.331 --> 14:11.104
national examination and the state our whole 
state board exam. T.D.' 's never gotten the credit

14:12.910 --> 14:14.172
that he deserved. But I was president of the board, 
and we were in Anaheim, California, and T.B. and I

14:22.966 --> 14:33.423
got the board president from Colorado, Whitey 
Albrecht from California. I've forgotten his

14:33.603 --> 14:35.506
name. One from Washington State. one from Kansas, 
one from Oklahoma, Sam Strong from Oklahoma.

14:46.647 --> 14:54.957
And we told the National Board, National 
Examining Service, if they didn't improve it and

14:46.647 --> 14:54.957
do what we wanted, we were going to pull out of it. 
Well, they couldn't operate without us. So they

15:00.322 --> 15:07.150
did improve it, and the national exam improved, I 
think, tremendously the next from then on. I

15:08.793 --> 15:12.458
haven't seen one lately, but I know it was a big 
thing. I know I served on the National Examining

15:12.618 --> 15:26.536
Board, and we would go up every year and go through 
those questions and see that there were new

15:12.618 --> 15:26.536
questions, fresh questions, and it made a big 
difference. They were just giving us anything

15:28.619 --> 15:33.846
they wanted, and it was no good.

15:41.875 --> 15:55.735
Also,

15:41.875 --> 15:55.735
it's

15:41.875 --> 15:55.735
much more complex as regards the possibilities of 
malpractice and so forth now, is it not? With the

15:57.277 --> 16:10.836
attorneys becoming much more active in the field 
of this and that, they're

15:57.277 --> 16:10.836
ambitious both from the standpoint of protecting 
someone who perhaps ought to be reprimanded and

16:11.980 --> 16:18.411
also for bringing frivolous suits about.

16:21.256 --> 16:25.263
Well, I'm sure that veterinary profession gets 
its share of them. I don't know it's I don't think we

16:25.283 --> 16:33.598
see near as many malpractice suits as possibly 
they should be. It's

16:39.301 --> 16:54.698
You don't realize

16:39.301 --> 16:54.698
just how much is involved until you start reading 
all the complaints that come into the examining

16:39.301 --> 16:54.698
board that have to be answered. And the people that 
complain, they feel like they have a legitimate

16:55.399 --> 17:01.946
complaint, which they do. I'm sure they feel like 
they do, and most of them are. There's room for it,

17:05.590 --> 17:08.633
but the big problem that could help avoid so many of 
these is communication. You know that being in

17:18.043 --> 17:31.360
practice that you have good days and you have bad 
days and it's pretty easy to brush them off if

17:18.043 --> 17:31.360
you're not careful and that's the big problem. I 
don't think it's that they don't know what they're

17:33.623 --> 17:38.029
doing but I think that it's They just don't 
communicate with the client. If the client

17:47.577 --> 17:52.642
understands everything before they leave, it 
eliminates a lot of problems, doesn't it? It's

17:52.662 --> 17:53.783
always done. Sure enough.

17:58.307 --> 18:05.253
Anything else you wish to give for the good of the 
cause while you're telling how everything is?

18:06.594 --> 18:08.256
I'm... I think it would be well... You're one of the 
fine people who has become involved a whole lot

18:10.038 --> 18:23.229
civically, and I think it's well to tell all your 
civic positions here in the city of Greenville.

18:23.249 --> 18:26.472
Well, I've served on the school board for 12 years. 
I was president of it for six years. I served on the

18:30.055 --> 18:35.100
city council for two terms, and I was mayor for one 
term. And that was... Six years on city council, 12

18:39.485 --> 18:43.169
years on school board. Served 12 years on state 
examining board. Served three years on the

18:47.473 --> 18:50.896
national board of examiners. President of the 
American Association of State Boards. And I was

18:57.622 --> 19:08.833
representative of the state boards to FARB, which 
is a federation of Association

19:09.893 --> 19:14.761
of Health.

19:20.490 --> 19:21.031
I don't know. I've forgotten. It's been 10 years. 
Federal Association of Related Boards? Not

19:25.378 --> 19:26.640
related board. Federal Association of Health. 
F-A-H-R-B, of Health. Uh.

19:38.176 --> 19:48.154
I don't know, it doesn't matter a whole lot, but it 
was an interesting job for a while. But I've been

19:50.738 --> 20:00.876
active in Chamber of Commerce and in Greenville 
and

19:50.738 --> 20:00.876
tried to be a good citizen.

20:05.142 --> 20:05.764
Very fine. Dr. Wilkins, we certainly appreciate 
all the contributions that you and your father

20:05.804 --> 20:20.481
before you have made for the veterinary 
profession, and we're looking forward to many

20:05.804 --> 20:20.481
more years of such service. Well, thank you, Bob.
