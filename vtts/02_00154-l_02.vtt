WEBVTT

00:02.242 --> 00:29.717
and agreed that we would try to set a price on it

00:02.242 --> 00:29.717
and first try to sell it ourselves and then thus 
avoiding the having to pay the real estate fee then

00:02.242 --> 00:29.717
since we had March, April, May, and June before 
moving west to begin work on July 1, then we could

00:30.389 --> 00:52.192
later hand the matter over to a real estate agent.

00:52.212 --> 00:59.400
So when we went to sleep that night, we each agreed 
we were mentally and emotionally exhausted but

01:00.764 --> 01:06.992
were hopeful for the future.

01:11.418 --> 01:28.780
The next morning the phone awakened us at a 
comparatively early hour

01:11.418 --> 01:28.780
and a faculty wife real estate agent called asking 
about if she might sell our house.

01:33.940 --> 02:01.416
At first, I was unwilling to allow her to consider 
it, but then a quick spousal

01:33.940 --> 02:01.416
conference led to the conclusion to add $10,000 to 
what the price we had

01:33.940 --> 02:01.416
generally concluded as an acceptable sum the 
previous night. and to tell this caller that she

02:03.168 --> 02:12.943
could show the house to only one family and must do 
it while we were at church the following day.

02:16.248 --> 02:31.150
Thus, Sunday afternoon at about dark, we were 
totally unprepared for the knock on the door when

02:16.248 --> 02:31.150
the smiling sales lady handed us a signed contract

02:34.403 --> 02:39.170
for the house at the price we had originally asked. 
Paragraph.

02:46.980 --> 03:03.904
As the weeks progressed that spring and the combat 
between the chancellor and the president grew

02:46.980 --> 03:03.904
more heated,

02:46.980 --> 03:03.904
it now seems obvious

03:06.618 --> 03:30.781
that

03:06.618 --> 03:30.781
their disagreement

03:06.618 --> 03:30.781
made it easier for the board to make a decision

03:06.618 --> 03:30.781
regarding that matter.

03:34.205 --> 03:36.507
A clarifying Reality was President Miller's 
failure to shake the hand of Melanie's Ink Graft.

03:48.380 --> 04:05.565
Another potential factor seems to have been the 
board's discovery of the organized campaign

03:48.380 --> 04:05.565
to encourage

04:08.718 --> 04:10.200
Individuals all over the state. To urge. Let 
Jarvis be selected as president. Two and a half

04:17.968 --> 04:21.131
years earlier, about three years earlier.

04:28.238 --> 04:29.640
Paragraph on Tuesday morning. Black Prescott had 
a. Brief reception on 2nd floor of the Koch

04:34.785 --> 04:37.628
building. where close associates could gather 
and wish me well in the new task out west.

04:58.168 --> 05:07.581
Early that morning I realized that I should go 
thank Frank Hubert for his many years of positive

05:08.455 --> 05:38.243
effect on my life, beginning with seventh grade 
band director, 12th

05:08.455 --> 05:38.243
grade principal,

05:08.455 --> 05:38.243
appointment as dean of arts and sciences, and at 
about the same time, I received a temporary

05:08.455 --> 05:38.243
appointment as instructor.

05:42.543 --> 05:43.004
When I. So I called to ask if I could have a few 
minutes. To express appreciation. And hurried

05:50.696 --> 05:52.719
over to the system building.

05:55.984 --> 05:59.549
Knowing of the of the reception at the Koch 
building. I had I tried to make my visit brief. But

06:06.500 --> 06:08.483
then he asked me to pause.

06:11.399 --> 06:24.218
and identify for him, quote, the five best 
department heads on campus,

06:11.399 --> 06:24.218
period, quote. When I responded that I was not sure 
I could single them out that clearly, I suggested

06:24.238 --> 06:40.782
that instead I try to pick the best out of each 
college. And he asked that I do engineering first.

06:46.814 --> 06:53.803
Quickly, I identified Charlie Holland from 
chemical engineering.

06:57.588 --> 07:06.640
And then he asked

06:57.588 --> 07:06.640
why I had not mentioned Chuck Sampson.

07:06.660 --> 07:07.461
I responded.

07:10.057 --> 07:38.190
that he was not then a department head,

07:10.057 --> 07:38.190
and silently did not want to mention to him that the 
faculty had gone to Dean Fred Benson

07:10.057 --> 07:38.190
to complain about

07:10.057 --> 07:38.190
the lack of organizational progress

07:41.393 --> 07:43.115
Before in the department. Before Doctor Samson.

07:50.083 --> 07:52.466
Ended his service as department head. He 
continued with questions about. Doctor Samson.

08:01.516 --> 08:03.899
So when I got back to the Coke building. I quickly 
pulled. Miller. Vestal Prescott.

08:13.405 --> 08:14.446
And coldest aside. And told him that I thought I had 
just gotten a clue. About. One of the items at the

08:21.593 --> 08:25.256
upcoming board agenda.

08:28.099 --> 08:30.501
Because Doctor Miller had mentioned on Monday. At 
my last staff meeting. That the board very well

08:35.766 --> 08:40.510
might select a new vice chancellor for 
engineering.

08:42.903 --> 08:46.512
At their board meeting on Thursday and Friday of 
that week.

08:49.780 --> 08:54.491
When I summarize the question, the conversation 
with Chancellor Hubert. The group agreed firmly.

09:06.393 --> 09:09.737
Following the party, Joe and I went to have 
paragraph. Following the party, Joe and I, the

09:10.097 --> 09:32.164
reception, Joe and I went to have lunch with Ken and 
Ann Pierce, old friends from the young couples

09:10.097 --> 09:32.164
class, and then headed out, trying to drive as far 
as we could that Tuesday afternoon and evening

09:32.903 --> 09:42.778
making our way all the miles to Fort Stockton

09:32.903 --> 09:42.778
a bit after midnight.

09:46.965 --> 10:01.307
When we arrived in El Paso late the next afternoon, 
we went to the president's residence to see how

09:46.965 --> 10:01.307
well our furnishings would fit into that 
beautiful old structure. Because on our previous

10:03.498 --> 10:15.212
campus visits, we had not been able to go into the 
house because my predecessor at UTEP had not given

10:03.498 --> 10:15.212
us access.

10:19.577 --> 10:31.210
When we reached the structure at perhaps 4 
o'clock, it seemed that almost every employee of

10:19.577 --> 10:31.210
the UTEP physical plant staff was there. 
painting, papering, straightening. So we went on

10:36.301 --> 11:01.213
to eat an early supper and came back to the 
president's house and

10:36.301 --> 11:01.213
with true delight wandered through that big,

10:36.301 --> 11:01.213
that commodious old structure trying to identify 
with pieces of masking tape the furnishings that

11:02.780 --> 11:31.673
we wanted placed in storage,

11:02.780 --> 11:31.673
and went on and then got to our motel 
accommodations at about 1030,

11:02.780 --> 11:31.673
as was the habit in that era. Of all travelers, I 
stopped at the desk, the motel, to see if there were

11:34.100 --> 11:44.715
any messages or phone calls to return.

11:47.700 --> 12:00.478
The clerk handed me a note

11:47.700 --> 12:00.478
marked urgent, quote, call Dr. Prescott at 
President Miller's home, period, quote.

12:05.335 --> 12:07.177
The urgent say the. The note of urgency. 
Certainly.

12:15.705 --> 12:16.586
Caught my attention. So I asked when the call had 
come. And the clerk. Showed me that she had

12:24.774 --> 12:26.316
written. Obvious reception at 730 Mountain Time. 
Well, I began shaking my head and Joe asked me what

12:32.673 --> 12:37.839
the matter was and I told her. Adding that. I felt it 
must be something serious. Because Doctor

12:45.329 --> 12:50.475
Prescott would not have been calling to wish 
simply they wish us good luck.

12:57.063 --> 13:02.410
I wondered if possibly there had been an accident 
involving one of the Miller daughters. But then,

13:03.841 --> 13:13.916
in an attempt at humor, continued with the 
thought,

13:03.841 --> 13:13.916
quote, but who knows? The board is meeting 
tomorrow. Anything could happen. Period, quote.

13:22.288 --> 13:24.010
So she asked, are you going to call? And I said, no, 
it is too late. Now, 1130 Central Time, I'll call in

13:27.535 --> 13:30.760
the morning.

13:34.756 --> 13:36.638
At about 7 o'clock the next morning. I was awakened 
by a reporters call. Asking for. From the Brian

13:44.308 --> 13:45.409
Eagle. And later from one of the Houston papers 
asking. For my comment. About the. Regents.

13:56.843 --> 13:58.425
Termination of President Miller. Of Jarvis 
Miller service as president, Texas A&M. the

14:03.224 --> 14:04.626
previous afternoon.

14:10.435 --> 14:14.240
Paragraph.

14:15.903 --> 14:32.708
Since that time, I've learned that Dr. and Mrs. 
Miller

14:15.903 --> 14:32.708
had hosted the board chairman, vice chairman, and 
one other member of the board, their home on

14:15.903 --> 14:32.708
Tuesday evening. In the hope to cultivate 
goodwill.

14:40.268 --> 14:41.410
And apparently thought. That their effort had 
some success. Then Wednesday at noon. The entire

14:49.600 --> 14:51.983
board. Was at the president's home for lunch.

15:03.738 --> 15:04.118
Thus. When Doctor Miller received a call to come to 
the board meeting. Come to the board quarters.

15:13.848 --> 15:15.750
Near the end of the working day.

15:18.732 --> 15:21.215
He apparently thought that he was going. That he 
would learn. Of his victory. In the tug of

15:29.022 --> 15:31.905
administrative war.

15:37.066 --> 15:43.254
When he walked in the boardroom, they told him that 
as a 5 o'clock that day. His services as president

15:44.275 --> 15:50.263
had been terminated and that he was being 
reassigned. To. The. Agriculture Research

15:56.511 --> 15:57.752
Center. At West Laco.

16:05.302 --> 16:06.904
The next day, the board appointed Chuck Sampson as 
interim president.

16:14.996 --> 16:34.280
So,

16:14.996 --> 16:34.280
Joe and I began our service in El Paso at the time of 
true change on the campus at A&M.

16:34.300 --> 16:35.642
And perhaps at that point, should cease this 
recitation. And I thank you very much.

16:49.512 --> 17:02.254
My task as dean of faculty has perhaps increased a 
bit in its breadth and responsibility with the

16:49.512 --> 17:02.254
departure of Dr. Winerdi, Charles McCandless, 
from education. The associate dean of education

17:05.014 --> 17:16.248
came over to join us, and Chuck brought a great deal 
of warmth, quality, and capability to the team.

17:19.833 --> 17:28.444
Most research matters now went to a

17:19.833 --> 17:28.444
research area.

17:31.259 --> 17:53.082
And I became the, more than ever, the most likely 
recipient of every matter relating to academics,

17:31.259 --> 17:53.082
especially those in which faculty were directly 
involved.

17:56.065 --> 17:58.448
These included some interesting termination 
some

18:00.318 --> 18:29.492
episodes

18:00.318 --> 18:29.492
where faculty members were terminated

18:00.318 --> 18:29.492
for

18:00.318 --> 18:29.492
cause

18:00.318 --> 18:29.492
and lawsuits.

18:29.512 --> 18:30.173
One of the paragraph one of the more interesting 
matters we had to deal with soon was the visit of a

18:31.216 --> 18:58.843
federal investigating team

18:31.216 --> 18:58.843
looking at the continuing at the continuing 
effects

18:31.216 --> 18:58.843
of

19:01.810 --> 19:30.130
segregation of segregation in public higher 
education in the south

19:01.810 --> 19:30.130
as a part of that review

19:01.810 --> 19:30.130
federal investigators

19:01.810 --> 19:30.130
spent about a week at A&M

19:01.810 --> 19:30.130
and a similar period

19:32.860 --> 19:49.103
at Prairie View

19:32.860 --> 19:49.103
plus the same time at the University of Texas at 
Austin and at Texas Southern.

19:49.123 --> 20:01.821
President Miller assigned me to coordinate with 
that group

19:49.123 --> 20:01.821
to try to keep him aware of what they, quote, were up 
to.

20:26.860 --> 20:34.731
and to give the visitors whatever assistance they 
might need.

20:38.796 --> 20:55.298
One of my first impressions was a bit of a shock when 
the team supposedly

20:38.796 --> 20:55.298
well-versed in higher education matters asked

20:38.796 --> 20:55.298
if the terms put all of these in quotes, lecturer, 
professor, instructor, and teacher could be used

20:56.442 --> 21:11.486
interchangeably as substitutes for each other.

21:16.574 --> 21:23.445
Late in the week after we became comparatively 
well acquainted,

21:26.564 --> 21:38.015
I asked the group if there was some way that

21:26.564 --> 21:38.015
they might recommend...

21:46.202 --> 21:54.310
I asked the group if there was a way they might 
recommend that engineering and agriculture at

21:46.202 --> 21:54.310
Prairie View be moved to College Station to become 
part of the flagship campus, bringing faculty,

21:55.201 --> 22:08.681
students, and so forth.

22:13.067 --> 22:23.723
My argument was that this would immediately give 
A&M an appropriate cadre of black faculty and

22:13.067 --> 22:23.723
students faculty, staff, and students.

22:30.470 --> 22:53.777
Further, I contended that the alternative

22:30.470 --> 22:53.777
was that Prairie View, by comparison, would never 
be able to be first class in those fields when

22:30.470 --> 22:53.777
compared to other land grant institutions.

22:58.853 --> 23:28.337
In a few moments, the group indicated their 
personal agreement

22:58.853 --> 23:28.337
with the conclusions I was offering,

22:58.853 --> 23:28.337
but then just as quickly indicated that they did 
not believe they would be well advised to dare to

22:58.853 --> 23:28.337
offer such a proposal.

23:36.518 --> 23:40.381
And thus, an opportunity was missed.

23:43.444 --> 23:52.151
They did ask what I would suggest Prairie View, the 
Prairie View of the future might become. And I

23:53.873 --> 24:05.563
suggested that they recommend that Prairie View 
be designated as the state's primary arts and

23:53.873 --> 24:05.563
science institution.

24:07.889 --> 24:36.158
that with its because of its location not far from 
the urban the increasing urban sprawl northwest

24:07.889 --> 24:36.158
of houston

24:07.889 --> 24:36.158
that before many decades passed

24:07.889 --> 24:36.158
that second oldest of all texas public higher 
education campuses would be located in a place

24:37.538 --> 24:54.264
that might attract a large number of Houstonians, 
of Houston area residents.

25:01.655 --> 25:03.698
In my opinion, however, few of them would be 
interested in agriculture

25:04.943 --> 25:32.132
and that the without real competitive quality in 
engineering

25:04.943 --> 25:32.132
a program in that field there would not attract 
Houstonians or many other

25:34.711 --> 25:39.897
highly qualified students from Texas or 
elsewhere.

25:43.260 --> 25:50.328
Nevertheless, none of the suggestions worked.

25:50.348 --> 26:03.402
And the final result of the panel study was simply 
to encourage all southern states to give better

25:50.348 --> 26:03.402
additional funding to the historically black 
institutions.

26:10.836 --> 26:11.317
Paragraph.

26:15.682 --> 26:33.945
One of the

26:15.682 --> 26:33.945
interesting areas of effort that came my way as 
dean of faculties

26:15.682 --> 26:33.945
was working with the Department of 
Intercollegiate Athletics

26:38.836 --> 26:57.093
having tried to play football and run track in high 
school and for a couple years at Austin College, I

26:38.836 --> 26:57.093
enjoyed athletic events greatly,

26:38.836 --> 26:57.093
particularly because of the spirit of A&M.

27:04.160 --> 27:06.042
Soon after Dr. Williams arrived,

27:08.468 --> 27:19.262
he

27:08.468 --> 27:19.262
decided not to renew the contract of Gene 
Stallings as head football coach.

27:27.793 --> 27:37.446
Beebs, as he was known by everyone

27:27.793 --> 27:37.446
since his earliest years, had played for the 
legendary Bear Bryant and come to A&M as the

27:39.350 --> 27:50.768
youngest head coach of a major American football 
program.

27:53.292 --> 28:06.893
In one of his early, in his second or third year, he 
won the Southwest Conference and beat Bear and the

27:53.292 --> 28:06.893
Alabama Crimson Tide in the Cotton Bowl.

28:10.180 --> 28:27.848
Then the program

28:10.180 --> 28:27.848
declined and Coach Stallings

28:10.180 --> 28:27.848
was unable to build a strong rapport with the 
faculty.

28:33.176 --> 28:35.580
I have said to a number of individuals

28:38.885 --> 29:06.817
As he began to,

28:38.885 --> 29:06.817
as his program, quote, began to go down the drain, 
most of the faculty sat on their hands and did

28:38.885 --> 29:06.817
nothing to hinder that decline, period, quote.

29:06.837 --> 29:07.558
Dr. Williams, called upon Bud Wilkinson, who had 
recently retired as head coach, as the splendidly

29:09.260 --> 29:24.256
successful head coach at the University of 
Oklahoma,

29:09.260 --> 29:24.256
to serve as a consultant.

29:27.119 --> 29:38.811
And he apparently recommended Emory Bellard, 
B-E-L-L-A-R-D,

29:27.119 --> 29:38.811
the offensive coordinator and backfield coach at 
the University of Texas, Who had created who had

29:40.208 --> 29:42.933
been the creator? Of the very successful. Quote 
wishbone. Offense. Quote that had put Daryl Royal

29:50.025 --> 29:53.210
and the Longhorns.

29:56.756 --> 29:58.159
Near the top of the national. Rankings every year.

30:04.710 --> 30:05.912
Coach Blard came. and brought with him a highly 
energetic staff.

30:14.909 --> 30:38.211
One of the more noticeable recruiting techniques

30:14.909 --> 30:38.211
was that some of the Houston recruits were brought 
to College Station by helicopter,

30:14.909 --> 30:38.211
which landed at Kyle Field.

30:40.975 --> 31:09.598
On those Saturdays, I was often asked to speak to 
the recruits and to welcome them to college

30:40.975 --> 31:09.598
station,

30:40.975 --> 31:09.598
a task which I very
