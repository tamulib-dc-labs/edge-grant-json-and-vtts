00:01.516 --> 00:17.480
Today's date is July 17th, July 18th, July 19th, 
testing, testing, this is a test, this is a test,

00:01.516 --> 00:17.480
testing, testing, by getting some back... That 
we'll have to live with. Yeah, that's fine. Oh,

00:19.543 --> 00:20.104
wait a minute. Today is July 18th, 1985. I'm 
talking to Officer Teal. What's your first name?

00:26.754 --> 00:27.034
John. John Teel, T-E-E-L, about who is an officer 
on the UC police force. And I want to start off by

00:34.621 --> 00:37.405
talking a little bit about your background. Where 
and when were you born? When did you start with a

00:38.887 --> 00:40.569
police force? JOHN TEEL, I was born in Kansas. I'm 
57 years old. I've been here in California since I

00:45.757 --> 00:49.843
was 9. I have been here on the campus since 1959. 
Okay. So could you tell me a little bit about the

00:57.433 --> 01:06.161
training and the police force in 1959 and how it's 
changed since today? In 1959, they gave you a gun, a

01:06.641 --> 01:19.793
flashlight, and a map, and keys to the building, 
and said, go out there and do it. And they didn't

01:19.893 --> 01:22.035
give you any formalized training? None. None? 
None. How about today? Today it's so formalized

01:27.218 --> 01:38.048
that it is almost bordering on

01:27.218 --> 01:38.048
FBI standards, I would say. Really? And where did 
UC get these standards? I mean, where did they

01:42.333 --> 01:44.014
derive them from? Well, all the police 
departments within the state of California

01:44.034 --> 01:52.202
belong to the police officer standard of training 
post. They all have a school. We have schools that

01:54.480 --> 01:58.325
are 16 weeks old, or long. 16 weeks long, yeah. And 
after they go through a rigorous program on

02:00.066 --> 02:22.392
self-defense,

02:00.066 --> 02:22.392
how to subdue people without hurting them, the use 
of your nightstick, the use of radios, traffic

02:00.066 --> 02:22.392
laws, rules, regulations, then they come back 
here. to us after 16 weeks in training. And they are

02:26.514 --> 02:31.283
put with a training officer for another 16 weeks. 
Like a senior officer on the force? A senior

02:34.249 --> 02:37.495
officer on the force or an officer that has been No, 
it has to be an officer that's been to the officer's

02:38.808 --> 02:45.418
training school with four training rookies. And 
that's 16 weeks, and after 16 weeks, he's then

02:46.780 --> 02:52.970
evaluated and either let go or retained. Now, why 
did this formalization, why did this school,

02:55.333 --> 03:01.002
rules and regulations, why did it come about? 
Well, it was just one of the things it had to be.

03:04.178 --> 03:09.143
Prior to POST, every department had their own 
little thing going. Yeah. Oakland has its own

03:11.426 --> 03:17.992
police academy, which is probably one of the best 
in California or the United States. San Francisco

03:18.112 --> 03:19.594
has another one. Los Angeles has their own. The 
smaller departments can't afford them. Sure. So

03:24.639 --> 03:26.681
they go to various places. We have one out in Near 
Antioch, we have another one in Chico and one in

03:28.522 --> 03:32.747
Sacramento. Sometimes we use the Highway Patrol 
Academy.

03:38.514 --> 03:40.476
And that's it. And did it have anything to do with 
the riots in the 1960s, do you think? Probably had

03:44.701 --> 03:47.044
everything to do with it. Could you explain that? 
We didn't even have radios at the time. The larger

03:50.408 --> 03:52.010
departments did. We had maybe four radios. When 
the riots broke out, we had 28 officers. What's the

03:58.981 --> 04:00.703
size of the force today? Oh, it's only 65, but we 
went to 108. My goodness, that's good

04:03.447 --> 04:07.753
information. Okay, when were you at 108? During 
the peak of the riots. I'd say, what, up to 19...

04:11.438 --> 04:15.965
Naples Park, 1969, something like that. Yeah. 
Okay. Oh, okay. Now, how about... The emphasis,

04:21.442 --> 04:26.607
has the emphasis as far as training officers 
changed? I don't understand the question. Has,

04:29.470 --> 04:44.745
has, well, obviously the type of training has 
changed, but I mean the emphasis on the type of

04:29.470 --> 04:44.745
tactics that you'd use in certain situations or 
the type of people that you'd recruit. Oh, well,

04:44.765 --> 04:50.250
the recruitment is still a high school education, 
clear background. and physical agility test,

04:50.956 --> 04:54.720
psychological test. Then they go in for, it's not 
so much, it's still self-defense for yourself in

04:56.522 --> 05:09.697
any situation, but you're taught how to take 
somebody down without hurting them.

05:09.717 --> 05:18.347
It's becoming more of a, almost a verbal 
confrontation now instead of the old times you

05:09.717 --> 05:18.347
used to get in an argument real quick, and it was 
knocked down and dragged out. Not to that effect,

05:23.473 --> 05:29.519
but it's that opposed from what we were doing as 
what we're doing now. Where the victim is, we're

05:29.759 --> 05:38.769
taught that the victim still has lots of rights and 
needs to be treated with respect, and that's it.

05:39.950 --> 05:44.114
And when about, do you remember when these rules 
and regulations first started? I'm trying to

05:45.516 --> 05:47.878
remember back, probably 60... No, let's see. We 
instituted our own police academy. I don't

05:55.011 --> 05:57.294
remember what year it was. Here on our own campus, 
we had people come to it from Berkeley, Albany, Rad

05:57.374 --> 06:03.521
Lab. And while we were there attending our school 
up at the football stadium, in the press box, they

06:04.382 --> 06:19.300
blew up the electrical

06:04.382 --> 06:19.300
transmission line up

06:21.963 --> 06:23.165
Centennial Road. Oh, okay. And I think that was in 
67?

06:30.119 --> 06:31.061
I'm not sure of the date. Yeah, I can check that out. 
Yeah. And then it was after that. Was it after that

06:36.712 --> 06:38.737
that they decided to? No, that's when they started 
it. Okay. Okay. They started to get a more

06:41.774 --> 06:44.037
formalized training? More formalized training. 
That's also, we had a new chief. Oh, okay, so...

06:48.543 --> 06:50.366
Chief Beal. Okay, who was the old chief? Woodward 
was the old chief. Woodward? He was an old-timer.

06:56.094 --> 06:56.935
He was a good man. He thought and... Do you remember 
his first name? Frank Woodward. Okay. And he was a

07:02.703 --> 07:04.886
wonderful person. And... He was in law 
enforcement his whole life, but his law

07:06.563 --> 07:15.234
enforcement was an entirely different phase than 
we have to accept today. Chief Beale came. He was

07:16.376 --> 07:18.058
a... What's his first name? William. Okay. He came 
to us from Berkeley. He retired from Berkeley,

07:22.544 --> 07:26.910
police department. But he had been to the FBI 
academies. He had been to, my God, I don't know. He

07:31.576 --> 07:34.039
had his Ph.D. in a... In criminology, he did? Oh, 
yeah. And the dissidents always claimed that

07:40.978 --> 07:45.924
Chief Beale did not have to carry a gun. He was armed 
with words at least four inches long.

07:55.155 --> 07:57.658
We would have followed him into a fire. That's what 
we thought of him.

08:03.736 --> 08:13.982
And so it was his idea, along with the general 
campus unrest and this particular blowing up some

08:03.736 --> 08:13.982
power lines, Well, the power lines had nothing to 
do with it. That was just a year that I remember that

08:16.441 --> 08:19.106
we were in school. Oh, okay. But it was his idea to 
formalize the police training? Yes. And his,

08:23.034 --> 08:28.825
actually, it was his starting it that we were up at 
our own academy. He had started that even then. Oh,

08:31.109 --> 08:32.071
okay. What other changes did he decide to bring 
about? Jurisdictional changes. With Berkeley,

08:38.701 --> 08:43.966
we would take care of our own property no matter 
where it's located. We'd have full control of it,

08:45.388 --> 08:50.253
working towards. Well, how was it before that? The 
only thing, we had a golden ring, so to speak,

08:52.215 --> 08:56.078
around the university. You didn't step across 
that ring. Yeah. OK. And that ring was like the

08:58.581 --> 09:01.884
border of the university? That was the border of 
the university. Hearst, Bancroft, Piedmont, and

09:03.866 --> 09:06.649
Oxford. OK, and the outlining areas that the 
university owned, like the People's Park area.

09:11.697 --> 09:12.357
The People's Park. The Berkeley police would take 
care of that before? We always had that. We had that

09:17.184 --> 09:18.346
all the time. Because that was right here. It was 
when they started bringing the dormitories in,

09:21.370 --> 09:26.517
lying off campus. We have property out in Albany 
now, Living Students Group. We have the Richmond

09:30.703 --> 09:33.126
Field Station. Oh, God, we've got people 
everywhere. I mean, property everywhere. And

09:37.619 --> 09:41.204
that's probably one reason for an increasing 
number of police on the force. No, that had nothing

09:41.444 --> 09:44.188
to do with the force. The reason they increased the 
force is because we needed them for bodies for

09:44.248 --> 09:52.178
protecting the university campus during the 
riots. Okay,

09:52.339 --> 09:55.483
okay. Any other changes that Beale brought about?

10:00.850 --> 10:03.433
No, there's so many different things that he'd 
done. that he's almost,

10:04.865 --> 10:11.594
it's hard to say what he didn't do. It's easier to 
say that he didn't do this than it would be to tell

10:12.356 --> 10:17.162
you what he did do. Okay, then how did the 
relationships with the student radicals change

10:17.182 --> 10:23.451
once he came in? They're still radical. Yeah. I 
mean, there was no change in them except you'd... I

10:29.580 --> 10:32.884
mean, the relationship between the police and the 
student radicals. I don't think there was any

10:33.605 --> 10:34.787
change. They still think the way they do. And we 
listen to them more than we used to. Maybe that's a

10:42.783 --> 10:44.405
change, a good change.

10:49.851 --> 10:57.340
We, in turn, really don't have a heck of a lot to do 
with them, because that all was handed through the

10:49.851 --> 10:57.340
chancellor's office, or supposed to be. OK, let's 
talk a little bit about the first riot or

11:04.585 --> 11:07.029
confrontation that you were in. Was that the free 
speech movement in 64? Didn't we have one prior to

11:09.713 --> 11:11.516
that? No, that was the first major one. That was the 
first one, yeah. That was the first major one in the

11:15.582 --> 11:17.986
fall of 1964. And that started all over a 
four-letter word that was posted at Van Croft and

11:18.006 --> 11:23.955
Telegraph. A guy was holding the sign up. Oh, that 
was the filthy speech. That came in. It's the same

11:28.982 --> 11:30.084
thing. Same thing. Okay, okay. And it started from 
there to where now they have Sproul Plaza, which is

11:33.610 --> 11:40.156
a free speech area. Almost anything goes. It's 
hard for anyone to be insulted on Sproul Plaza. I

11:51.747 --> 11:55.531
believe the courts has found that people can walk 
away from it if they don't like it. Well, when did

11:57.573 --> 12:01.977
that come about, where they made it a free speech 
plaza? That's when it started. Oh, okay, okay. And

12:05.805 --> 12:09.449
gradually it just worked up, even up until today, 
you know. Yeah, right. And I've, you know,

12:10.670 --> 12:18.578
everyone's been out there before, and 
occasionally, you know, someone will insult

12:10.670 --> 12:18.578
police officers. How do you deal with that? I'm not 
even going to talk to you about it. Oh, okay. Okay.

12:26.205 --> 12:27.166
What was your job? What were your 
responsibilities back about 1964 and 65 during

12:27.546 --> 12:33.452
the free speech movement? PATROLLING,

12:34.006 --> 12:38.432
TRYING TO TAKE THE PARK BACK. GENERAL, JUST 
GENERAL POLICE WORK. OKAY. AND WERE YOU INVOLVED

12:44.020 --> 12:48.687
THEN WITH THE PEOPLE'S PARK? OH, SURE. OKAY. COULD 
YOU TELL ME ABOUT THAT? IT WAS VERY SIMPLE. WE TOOK

12:55.276 --> 12:59.201
IT AWAY FROM THEM, AND THEY TOOK IT AWAY FROM US. 
FINALLY, THEY GAVE IT UP, AND WE GOT IT BACK, ONLY

12:59.902 --> 13:02.806
THEY NOW CONTROL IT. NOW, YOU FIGURE THAT ONE OUT. 
what does that do to morale on the police force it's

13:05.765 --> 13:30.338
the shits

13:05.765 --> 13:30.338
and uh who would you who would you or where would you 
play not who but where would you place a

13:05.765 --> 13:30.338
responsibility i'm not placing responsibility 
anywhere that's not my job oh okay can you tell me

13:05.765 --> 13:30.338
about the uh cooperation uh between the Berkeley 
police, the National Guard, and UC police?

13:36.739 --> 13:40.322
Totally 100% cooperation. Okay, well, can you 
tell me about the dynamics? I mean, who is in

13:42.244 --> 13:46.789
charge, and how do you deal when you have three 
separate forces like that? We had five, six, we

13:47.129 --> 13:50.693
probably had 20 different forces. We had highway 
patrol, city police, army, highway patrol. At

13:57.660 --> 13:58.941
that time, the sheriff's is the person that takes 
over okay okay so the sheriff's in charge of the

13:59.377 --> 14:27.308
chain of command at that time it's automatically 
his because it's in his county and that's

13:59.377 --> 14:27.308
california law it's california law you know i'd be 
that's kind of surprising because i would have

13:59.377 --> 14:27.308
thought that probably the national guard general 
would have taken over uh because he's a direct line

13:59.377 --> 14:27.308
to the governor we were telling the national guard 
general what to do i had a I don't know, a lieutenant

14:29.279 --> 14:33.283
colonel or a colonel or something. And we were 
standing at University House. And here comes a

14:36.866 --> 14:42.612
couple of thousand demonstrators, and he'd run 
over to me, my God, officer, what are we going to do?

14:43.272 --> 14:44.153
I said, stand up. And we did, and he didn't know what 
to do. But that's National Guard. I mean, that's

14:52.261 --> 14:55.123
not their primary purpose is not keeping order. 
Yeah, exactly. They were quartered in People's

14:57.646 --> 15:00.371
Park. We had a fence around it. And a number of the 
dissidents got together and they sent some very

15:02.976 --> 15:12.392
beautiful young ladies down to the park and gave 
them cookies. It turned out that they were laced

15:12.553 --> 15:16.940
with LSD and marijuana. So we don't take cookies 
from strange people.

15:24.730 --> 15:28.435
Tell me some of the other tactics that were used 
against you. Yesterday you said that there were

15:28.455 --> 15:33.502
real long slingshots. Could you tell me some of the 
weapons and tactics that were used? Well, they had

15:36.185 --> 15:47.040
long surgical tube slingshots for throwing 
rocks, and if they got a hold of one of our grenades

15:36.185 --> 15:47.040
that still was going, they'd throw it back at us. 
Tear gas grenades? Tear gas grenades. They

15:49.824 --> 15:50.805
used...

15:53.485 --> 15:59.693
mirrors to burn out the bulb in our TV cameras so we 
couldn't take pictures. They used laser beams, I

16:01.215 --> 16:06.721
guess, to the same effect.

16:08.183 --> 16:11.648
Rocks was their main object. Also, we were 
standing at Bancroft and Telegraph inside Sprout

16:13.971 --> 16:19.698
Plaza. And all of there was about, oh, 75 of us. They 
were making a march, and they were going down

16:25.878 --> 16:28.461
Bancroft. Well, we were not going to let them on 
campus. So out of the crowd came two Molotov

16:31.886 --> 16:37.253
cocktails and caught two highway patrolmen. And 
it's pretty horrible to see something like that

16:38.234 --> 16:40.817
happen. I can see why the guys in Nam might go nuts. 
They've seen it every day. What happened to these

16:46.985 --> 16:48.407
two officers? I have no idea.

16:53.105 --> 16:56.669
They weren't there long enough to be friends, and 
they were only comrades.

17:00.895 --> 17:11.989
Tell me about when you're in a confrontation like 
that, tell me about, and you see people marching on

17:00.895 --> 17:11.989
you, tell me about the feeling in the police line. 
Well, you have a great feeling of comradery. Your

17:17.996 --> 17:19.298
morale is high. You're doing something. You're 
working together. You treat each other closer

17:24.294 --> 17:27.878
than a fellow employee. You're almost like a 
brother. You're protecting his back. He's

17:30.942 --> 17:31.963
protecting yours. Real good feeling. And that is 
stressed in our training also. And

17:37.429 --> 17:45.419
our morale now is built up. We have a lag. During 
idle times, morale goes down. In busy times,

17:51.674 --> 17:53.196
morale is up. And our present administration is 
busy on building the morale, taking a positive

17:53.496 --> 18:08.738
view,

17:53.496 --> 18:08.738
trying not to start rumors. I mean, there's so many 
things that can lower morale. Right, right,

18:11.562 --> 18:13.184
exactly. And we're, as a whole unit, trying to 
combat it. But we're not the only ones who start

18:18.391 --> 18:20.254
rumors. The bad guys start them, too. Sure, sure. 
Absolutely. Now, let's, you know, you've been out

18:25.081 --> 18:37.159
there for a number of years, and, of course, during 
the 60s, you listened to probably a lot of the

18:25.081 --> 18:37.159
left-wing rhetoric. In the police force, did you 
men ever sit down and discuss any of the things that

18:37.679 --> 18:43.608
they were saying? Oh, sure. I mean, we had to. What 
the hell? We were human. I mean, you stand out there

18:48.071 --> 18:51.194
listening to them, you can't... They had some good 
ideas and they had some poor ideas. They just had

18:54.196 --> 18:55.998
more of the poor than they did good. But what did you 
feel were the good and what did you feel were the

18:57.739 --> 19:00.462
poor ideas? Well, they wanted to build up a unity 
within the university, which is fine. But on the

19:05.266 --> 19:07.148
same token, they kept tearing it down. They 
really, at that time, didn't know what they

19:07.949 --> 19:10.231
wanted. They were being led, we felt, by people 
other than students. We still feel that way. And

19:18.657 --> 19:20.239
who are these people? Call them what you want. 
Reds, communists,

19:22.803 --> 19:30.574
people that don't like universities. I don't 
know. I'd be a damn fool to put my foot in that one.

19:40.218 --> 19:43.002
Okay.

19:43.322 --> 19:48.089
Obviously, behavior toward demonstrations must 
have changed over the years. In what way? In the

19:51.314 --> 19:53.096
type of tactics that you would use. Well, sure. We 
used to wait for them. I mean, we used to go into them

19:56.081 --> 19:58.624
and charge. Now we wait for them. And I don't know if 
it's better or not. And how about the tactic? And

20:05.854 --> 20:09.820
how about, for example, this new apartheid 
movement? How have you responded? What are the

20:11.678 --> 20:14.161
differences in the ways that you respond to that? 
Well, they haven't as yet destroyed property.

20:17.685 --> 20:17.965
Right. They're, I'd say, 60% non-students.

20:26.574 --> 20:26.674
Yeah. If that many is students, 40%.

20:34.602 --> 20:35.503
They were blocking... passageways, the court 
seemed to, in Berkeley, find that they weren't

20:36.597 --> 20:41.041
guilty. Come what may.

20:47.527 --> 21:03.761
Now, I've read over at the Bancroft Library, I've 
read some American Civil Liberty Union

20:47.527 --> 21:03.761
literature on police brutality, especially 
during, of course, the People's Park in 1969 and

20:47.527 --> 21:03.761
the curfew and all of that. How would you respond to 
that? Well, I guess Molotov cocktails are not

21:05.403 --> 21:08.349
brutality.

21:13.761 --> 21:18.691
So in other words, your response would be you were 
just responding to force. You use reasonable

21:19.193 --> 21:24.103
force to overcome reasonable force.

21:28.319 --> 21:31.384
Let's talk a little bit about the movement. I saw 
some other flyers which dealt with disarming the

21:31.404 --> 21:35.831
police. There was an attempt, especially in 
Berkeley, to disarm them. Was there an attempt

21:42.842 --> 21:44.605
like that on campus? There has been attempts like 
that over the years. The world is full of

21:49.593 --> 21:53.078
dissidents, and they all come to Berkeley. Well,

21:54.593 --> 22:03.803
what's the police force opinion on that? We don't 
want to lose our guns. I mean, you use your gun, you

22:05.185 --> 22:09.810
lose your gun, you lose your authority, a lot of it. 
I mean, even from Wyatt Earp. Yeah.

22:18.680 --> 22:24.567
Because we've got little guys, too, you know, and 
women of small stature that... Without the

22:25.373 --> 22:31.141
outward appearance of authority, they'd be hard 
pressed to take care of themselves. That's how I

22:31.883 --> 22:32.644
feel. I don't. Well, that's fine. That's all I 
want. How about the relationship with the Board of

22:36.309 --> 22:41.777
Regents and the UC police? We have nothing to do 
with the Regents. We protect them. They're the

22:46.086 --> 22:46.947
bosses. Yeah. But just like you, I suppose you 
don't know the president of the university at

22:48.951 --> 22:53.840
Texas, do you, personally? Yeah, I know. You know? 
Yeah, but it's unusual, but usually I don't. Yeah,

22:58.509 --> 22:59.652
same thing. Yeah. We know who they are, and we know 
they're their bosses. Yeah, yeah. And they've

23:03.399 --> 23:05.463
been good to us overall. Mm-hmm. They just gave us a 
new retirement package. Oh, nice.

23:12.214 --> 23:14.961
Is it a good one compared to... Oh, it's much better 
than we had. Oh, good. The basic rule is people can

23:18.057 --> 23:22.924
work at the university, I think, until they're 70 
or 72. You're no damn good out on the street if

23:22.944 --> 23:27.431
you're 70 or 72 as a cop. They've dropped it down to 
where you can retire at age 50. Oh, wow. And then you

23:33.240 --> 23:34.983
get some sort of a retirement? Oh, yeah. And at age 
55, you get 2.5%. That's 2.5 times a year you've

23:39.089 --> 23:41.653
got. So you can get up to 80% of your salary, which is 
not bad at all. At 55, that's real nice. Yeah, if

23:48.714 --> 23:52.200
you've got 30 years in. How many years? 57? You'll 
have 30 years coming? I got 34 in. I had prior

23:58.230 --> 23:59.292
service. Oh, I see. Great. Let's talk a little bit 
about Governor Reagan. He's my hero. Did the

24:11.398 --> 24:20.831
spirit go up in the force with his tough stance 
toward dissidents during the 1960s after he was

24:11.398 --> 24:20.831
elected? Whoever was governor would have had to 
take in the same stance, I'm sure. You can't stand

24:27.700 --> 24:35.192
by and see property destroyed, especially as 
considered state property, even though it is not.

24:35.432 --> 24:40.700
It does belong to the regents, even though we do get 
a lot of money from the state. Well, why do you say it

24:43.164 --> 24:45.047
is your hero, then? No, I just like it. Oh, okay. 
Okay, let's talk a little bit about what were you?

24:53.620 --> 24:57.866
What was your job and your responsibilities then 
during People's Park? I started out, I was with the

24:59.368 --> 25:14.851
detective division, and we went down and drove 
stakes that says, keep off, keep out, the park is

24:59.368 --> 25:14.851
off limits, blah, blah, blah. And as we put them in 
the ground, there was people behind us pulling

25:15.372 --> 25:19.358
them out. It went from there downhill. We put a 
fence around it. They tore it down and tore up the

25:26.300 --> 25:28.402
parking lot. By hand. Not with picks and shovels, 
but by hand. There was some asphalt there, wasn't

25:32.446 --> 25:34.108
there? Oh, yes. There was a lot of asphalt. And 
prior to that, prior to the park, there was a

25:36.770 --> 25:41.374
business area there. A small business area and 
some one-level living groups. We went in and tore

25:48.498 --> 25:51.982
everything down, getting ready to... I think they 
were probably going to build student housing

25:52.503 --> 25:56.027
there at that time. And that just happened to be a 
rallying point for the dissidents to go to.

26:04.737 --> 26:10.143
Otherwise, they'd have placed no, I don't think, 
any significance at all on it. It just was a good...

26:12.258 --> 26:14.182
Spot to go to and a good focus. And it got 
everybody's attention. It's an open space,

26:16.646 --> 26:23.438
parks, trees, babies, dogs.

26:23.458 --> 26:27.626
And then did you help do any of the construction as 
far as the fence was concerned? No. All we did was

26:28.327 --> 26:29.970
guard it. We guarded the people that were putting 
it in. What about the fact, were you on the scene

26:34.685 --> 26:44.779
when the one character was shot and killed and the 
other one was blind? I was working that day and he

26:44.799 --> 26:49.947
was a wanted felon out of another city and had been 
here for three days. And he was on a roof and he was

26:51.329 --> 27:01.002
getting ready to throw a piece of concrete 
approximately six inches square with steel

26:51.329 --> 27:01.002
sticking out of it into a crowd of policemen. 
Regardless of what you heard. No, I mean, I've just

27:05.347 --> 27:08.952
read a number of reports, and they all conflict. I 
know. That's why I wanted your view. I know. It's

27:13.358 --> 27:14.619
really hard to get the answer. But very few people 
want to hear our side of the view. Well, that's why I

27:17.443 --> 27:18.264
want it. And so he was standing up on top of which 
building? Some, I don't know which one it was, down

27:22.871 --> 27:25.434
here on Telly. Oh, it was on Telegraph. Yeah. I 
thought he was right over by the... Oh, okay, so

27:28.718 --> 27:36.387
he's probably about... Not over a block away. 
Yeah, okay, about a block away. He was not on

27:39.090 --> 27:40.272
campus. Yeah. Period. Was he shot by UC or 
Berkeley? No, I don't know who he was shot by. What

27:49.542 --> 27:54.368
about the fellow that was blinded?

27:54.388 --> 27:56.110
I thought he was blinded in the park. When was this? 
What are you talking about? This was during the

27:58.852 --> 28:00.174
riots? Yeah, it was about the same day, I think. No. 
The reports I read was someone was shot with a

28:02.839 --> 28:07.667
shotgun or something. Oh, there was a number of 
people shot, but I don't believe that there was

28:07.687 --> 28:11.674
anybody blinded. I might be in error, but I don't 
remember

28:11.714 --> 28:16.883
it. I

28:16.863 --> 28:26.915
have another question, and that deals with just 
types of force that could be used. That is, was

28:27.535 --> 28:35.505
there any debate on using things like rubber 
bullets that you hear about a lot today? No, that's

28:35.745 --> 28:37.066
good today. But if you didn't have them, you didn't 
hear about them. Yeah, when did they come in? I have

28:41.752 --> 28:42.593
no idea. We still haven't got them. Oh, you don't? 
No. Do you know how effective they are as far as? I

28:48.783 --> 28:49.603
have no idea. When did you start using shields, 
plexiglass shields? On your helmets?

29:02.476 --> 29:02.616
Mm-hmm. First of all, I'm darned if I ever can 
remember, probably 65. Yeah,

29:05.599 --> 29:10.664
probably 65. I know maybe two years either way. 
Yeah. You don't think of these things. I mean, as to

29:16.593 --> 29:21.000
be remembered, you're just thankful to God you got 
them. And at that time, right around 65, 67, did

29:21.220 --> 29:29.111
other types of equipment come in common use that 
you hadn't used before? Not that we hadn't used,

29:30.193 --> 29:31.735
no. I mean, we'd always had our batons. I mean, 
looking back, we've always had our helmets, gas

29:36.162 --> 29:41.689
masks. We didn't get them until... After we'd all 
got severely gassed two or three times. No,

29:47.678 --> 29:53.306
not really. No protective clothing that would be 
of any value to this interview. What about no

30:00.996 --> 30:04.240
different types of boots or anything like that? 
No, no. Not like steel reinforced to protect your

30:05.141 --> 30:09.047
feet or anything like that? No. What about those 
big plexiglass shields that I've seen in

30:10.499 --> 30:14.747
pictures? We don't have such a thing. Oh, why not? 
Because I've seen those. You've seen them in

30:19.096 --> 30:25.448
Japan, China, but not in Berkeley.

30:25.468 --> 30:26.270
Why not? You don't know. They're too cumbersome. 
We had a different kind of infighting. And we had to

30:33.601 --> 30:42.133
use physical force where it looks like to me when 
they use the shields, why they're using water

30:33.601 --> 30:42.133
cannons and stuff like that over there. Yeah. 
Might be the good thing. Yeah, and they're real

30:45.438 --> 30:47.901
close, and maybe they're just pushing the crowds 
back. Correct. Yeah. Maybe they have more respect

30:50.625 --> 30:53.449
for the police over there than they do over here. 
Let's talk about that for a minute. Do you think

30:57.088 --> 31:09.041
that, well, during the 1950s, it seems to me as a 
historian that there was an awful lot of respect

30:57.088 --> 31:09.041
for the police, and, of course, that shifted 
dramatically in the 1960s. And it's changing

31:09.561 --> 31:11.123
again today. Okay. How do you think it's changing 
today? It's changing where more people have more

31:13.946 --> 31:23.436
respect for the police, but it's up to the police to 
show something going so they can be respected for

31:13.946 --> 31:23.436
it. We have to earn it. It's not given to us. What 
about organizations like organizations which

31:27.159 --> 31:34.171
would put out bumper stickers, support your local 
police and stuff? Did you get a lot of help from...

31:34.191 --> 31:38.618
You remember those bumper stickers. I got one 
probably in my memorabilia somewhere. Did you

31:44.589 --> 31:47.614
ever get any help from that type of organization? 
No. More... I guess moral support through people

31:50.078 --> 31:53.442
reading it, maybe. I don't know. But it physically 
didn't do us any good. And they didn't raise money?

31:59.930 --> 32:01.933
Not for us, they did not, no. That's kind of 
interesting because they bought, you know,

32:01.973 --> 32:12.906
large, well, they handed out thousands of these 
bumper stickers and then they bought billboards

32:01.973 --> 32:12.906
and put things like that up. Remember that 
billboard? Yeah. that had that little kid and it

32:14.581 --> 32:18.606
said on top, some call him pig.

32:21.729 --> 32:27.115
But that was their limit of their help then to UC 
police. I don't know what they did anywhere else,

32:27.135 --> 32:30.980
but here they didn't do nothing for us. We didn't 
ask for any help. I doubt if we would have taken it.

32:35.745 --> 32:36.346
Right, yeah. It might have been a conflict of 
interest. Yeah. That's interesting.

32:44.129 --> 32:52.008
Well, let's talk a little bit about the

32:44.129 --> 32:52.008
whole idea of residency. I read about 1971 and 72 
newspapers and flyers dealing with the Berkeley

32:58.878 --> 33:19.266
police in which they wanted the Berkeley police, 
they did some sort of survey and found that 85% of

32:58.878 --> 33:19.266
them didn't live in Berkeley and this and that and 
they wanted all of the police in Berkeley to be

32:58.878 --> 33:19.266
residents of the city and they wanted more more 
community control, they called it, of police. Did

33:24.215 --> 33:31.106
those residency changes, or did those changes 
down in Berkeley have any impact on the UC police?

33:31.547 --> 33:32.128
How could they? Well, I mean, would they... We have 
no room on campus to build houses. No, I don't mean,

33:37.016 --> 33:39.120
I mean as far as Berkeley. We could care less what 
Berkeley does. But I mean as far as where you're a

33:41.885 --> 33:44.950
resident. We have no resident regulations.

33:52.144 --> 33:57.251
We still have two or three people who live in 
Berkeley.

33:57.271 --> 34:02.660
You'd have to live in Berkeley to see the 
conditions to live here, so maybe that has

33:57.271 --> 34:02.660
something to do with it. Maybe it's good, maybe 
it's bad. I don't know. Did regulations as far as

34:06.505 --> 34:09.450
hiring change? As far as residency? No. Well, I 
can't answer for work. I'm only saying here. I

34:16.683 --> 34:17.504
know, I know. Okay, it did not apply to us in any way. 
Yeah, okay. Okay, how about as far as your

34:22.292 --> 34:24.496
recruitment is concerned? Does not apply. Not 
their recruitment, I'm talking about. Our

34:28.902 --> 34:32.188
recruitment has nothing to do with anything about 
residency. Okay. I suppose they can't live in

34:33.009 --> 34:34.391
Alaska. It's probably too far to commute. I know, 
okay. You're getting off the whole balance. Like I

34:40.140 --> 34:41.903
said, we had nothing to do. with Berkeley's 
residency ordinance. OK. Now, how about as far as

34:46.916 --> 34:50.919
your just basic recruitment? How has that changed 
as far as equal affirmative action, equal

34:50.939 --> 34:56.084
opportunity? We've always had it. Oh, really? You 
mean even when you started in the 50s? Sure. And so

35:03.431 --> 35:06.593
the proportion of women or minorities hasn't 
increased? We had no women. We had no women

35:08.475 --> 35:10.557
applying. That is interesting. And we now have, I 
don't know what you call minorities. I suppose

35:17.807 --> 35:21.071
you're talking about, what are you talking about 
as minorities? Blacks and Hispanics. We've got

35:23.073 --> 35:24.574
blacks, Hispanics. We've got black, Hispanic 
men. We've got black and Hispanic women. We have

35:33.745 --> 35:34.746
Asians.

35:39.992 --> 35:41.353
We had a part Indian. I guess we still got one of them 
or two. I don't know. But in other words, Berkeley

35:46.572 --> 35:50.378
Police Force has always been open to that. No. I 
don't have anything to do with Berkeley. Let's

35:52.682 --> 35:54.204
forget Berkeley. I mean, UC. I mean, I'm at UC. 
Yeah. UC has always been an open application

35:57.449 --> 36:03.298
police department. That is interesting. Well, 
why is that? Because Berkeley hasn't, nor had

36:06.503 --> 36:09.568
Oakland. Oakland, I can't speak for. I can 
remember when I came to work here, there was blacks

36:11.862 --> 36:17.510
on the Berkeley Police Department. But not the 
proportion that there is today. No, no. That's

36:23.457 --> 36:24.459
really interesting. Well, I'm about done. Okay. 
Oh, when do you feel that you're going to retire? As

36:32.630 --> 36:33.671
soon as I feel like it. He's been a hard guy all 
along. He's been a hard guy? Yeah. Oh, come on. He

36:42.295 --> 36:43.577
keeps thinking we're Berkeley. No, no, no, I'm 
just getting terms mixed up. But you think that

36:48.103 --> 36:54.852
there isn't going to be a mandatory term for you? 
Sure, if I wanted to stay until I'm 70, but I don't

36:55.533 --> 37:00.399
see nothing going for me in that direction.

37:03.563 --> 37:08.530
Whenever I feel I can't hold up my end of it, that's 
when I'll go. If I can't protect the guy I'm with,

37:09.522 --> 37:13.586
there's no need of me being out there.

37:16.649 --> 37:18.311
I hope I got sense enough to leave. Will you

37:20.754 --> 37:35.028
donate this interview to scholarly research at 
Texas A&M University? Only if it's to be used as

37:39.695 --> 37:46.061
scholistic material, not to be published or used 
in any other manner. But I could publish. Would you

37:48.003 --> 37:54.690
allow me to publish any quotes out of this in a 
scholarly book? If I could see them first, sure.

37:57.593 --> 38:00.136
Oh, OK. OK, fine. We're talking about student aid. 
So student aid started in 1971. And why did they

38:04.420 --> 38:06.242
start? To act as a buffer between the police 
department and the university and to

38:06.982 --> 38:23.827
be seen in uniform, let the university community 
know we had students working as police aides. And

38:25.028 --> 38:27.732
since then, it's mushroomed to where we have, 
what, 48? 41 aides now. They're our right arm. They

38:31.898 --> 38:35.824
dispatch, and when necessary, They do patrol. 
They do routine observation. They take bicycle

38:40.555 --> 38:43.919
theft reports.

38:45.321 --> 38:45.782
They do escort service. Yeah, they do escort 
service, which is a very important thing. If we

38:48.886 --> 39:02.162
have anybody that wants an escort home at night 
from anywhere on campus, and it seems like it's

38:48.886 --> 39:02.162
damn near anywhere in Berkeley or a mile radius, 
they walk them home. Oh, great. And they're the

39:07.175 --> 39:08.056
They don't complain. There's something wrong 
with them. They're students. Oh, they don't get

39:12.021 --> 39:13.783
paid? Oh, they get paid, sure. They make better 
than the bare wage. I think the bare wage is, what,

39:19.851 --> 39:25.598
$3, $3.35, and they start off at $5, I think. 601, 
yeah. And they're pretty intelligent for the most

39:28.842 --> 39:31.766
part. Yeah. They don't take part in an active 
felony. No. No confrontation. No arrests or

39:38.435 --> 39:39.476
anything like that. No, no confrontation. 
Without them, I don't think we could work. I mean,

39:44.523 --> 39:45.524
we could operate. They've just taken over so many 
of the duties that are mean, not, yeah, menial, but

39:45.544 --> 39:52.073
so meaningful. Yes, right. Filing. They are 
another reason for the completion of the office.

39:59.808 --> 40:00.549
Oh, yeah. Good to agree. And they run the Bike 
Bureau.

40:06.815 --> 40:08.316
Lost and Found. Oh, they're into everything. They 
go talk to the new students coming into the dorms.

40:17.564 --> 40:20.547
And why did this come about, this student aid 
program? That's one of Beale's programs. Oh, OK.

40:23.163 --> 40:25.968
And started off, I think we had two. They both 
worked for me for a long time. I started a bike

40:29.554 --> 40:31.156
bureau. And then Debbie was one. Kent Stewart was 
another. John Powell was another. Some of our

40:40.477 --> 40:44.081
aides have went on to become officers here. We have 
one officer, one aide that went on. He went

40:48.226 --> 40:50.368
officer, sergeant, and is now a lieutenant. 
Hickman. And we have several sergeants that are

40:54.193 --> 40:59.779
aides.

41:02.202 --> 41:04.945
Some of them haven't completed their degrees as 
yet. Some of them have.

41:09.822 --> 41:17.774
Thank God we had a hand in bending their little 
minds into being good cops, you know. And we're

41:17.794 --> 41:19.777
sought after from everywhere. Our people are 
recruited all the time. When we send somebody to an

41:23.442 --> 41:28.409
academy, they're out there recruiting for other 
departments. We've lost a few. We've gained a few.

41:31.814 --> 41:35.760
But the aid program per se, it's wonderful. Yeah. A 
nice buffer, though, between other students who

41:36.248 --> 41:46.304
have some doubts about the force versus just the 
police force who might have doubts about

41:36.248 --> 41:46.304
students. We have people that have never talked to 
an officer in their life. They're scared of

41:49.108 --> 41:50.070
police. They've wanted to talk to one. And I guess 
every day that goes by, when they're out there in

41:52.233 --> 41:59.725
uniform, somebody new approaches them and just, 
can I talk to you for a minute? And they know they're

41:59.986 --> 42:04.112
not cops, but they know they're orientated. We 
have a ride-along program for students. I guess

42:08.366 --> 42:12.350
every police department has one. So a student can 
just go out to pick people up with you? I mean, is

42:18.716 --> 42:19.797
that what you mean, ride-along? Well, no. I mean, 
any student can come to the department and ask to

42:20.218 --> 42:24.001
ride along with a police officer. When did that 
start? That sounds like another good idea. That

42:27.965 --> 42:29.567
was a Beale program also. It's easier to tell you 
what he didn't do than what he did. The student

42:35.058 --> 42:40.866
aides ride along with the officers, primarily at 
night. There's more action. And they man the radio

42:44.811 --> 42:49.618
if the officer gets in trouble. What do you do? What 
else do you do? Do you want to ride along? No. What

42:57.485 --> 43:01.571
about uniforms? Do you wear uniforms? Exactly 
like ours, except it says aid here. Yeah, they have

43:11.424 --> 43:14.388
a silver badge. It's a shield. And the Hill Patrol 
wears, I think, a chicken shit looking uniform.

43:24.622 --> 43:25.163
And... It's not very becoming to them at all. They 
think it is.

43:37.299 --> 43:42.203
That sounds like a really super program. It is. 
It's great. Is Bill still around? He has retired

43:45.586 --> 43:52.312
and is living his life up at Fort Bragg.

43:52.833 --> 43:55.555
He's went the lecture circuit. He's now writing a 
book.

44:03.227 --> 44:05.470
There's a guy who knew a lot about police work. He 
knew probably, he taught the FBI what police work

44:05.490 --> 44:10.298
was about. Do you happen to have his address? I'd 
like to write to him. Yes, you could write to Chief

44:14.465 --> 44:19.773
William P. Beale, Highway 1. No. B-E-A-L. 
B-E-A-L. E. E. What is it called? J. Bill, William

44:31.122 --> 44:32.885
P. Bill.

44:37.812 --> 44:43.541
Greater Highway, Bodega Bay, California. Pardon 
me. Not Bodega Bay. Greater Highway? Yeah. Yeah.

44:50.463 --> 44:51.384
Or is that Highway 1? No, it's a greater highway up 
there, Fort Bragg.

44:57.651 --> 45:02.517
Or I imagine you could probably call over here, and 
they would give you his. I'm sure he has a

45:03.238 --> 45:09.004
forwarding address somewhere.

45:09.665 --> 45:09.986
Yeah. Letty? Well. I should look his name up in a 
card catalog, because he might have published.

45:16.754 --> 45:18.196
Well, he's published different things. I don't 
know what. I know he's put out manuals. Yeah. He's a

45:22.723 --> 45:27.050
graduate of the University of California. I go 
fishing. We go up there, and I spend quite a bit of

45:28.513 --> 45:32.098
time with him while I'm there. And over the years, 
we've got to be real good friends.

45:38.008 --> 45:40.852
That isn't what makes me respect and worship him. 
Oh, yeah. Oh, I think that would be a start. Yeah.

45:44.800 --> 45:49.385
The

45:44.800 --> 45:49.385
greatest thing since sliced bread. Why did he 
retire? He was of age? Time. He got tired. He

45:57.174 --> 46:04.522
was just something else. In

46:04.682 --> 46:09.407
April of 69. Because he was the man that orders the 
video equipment and all that stuff. The Second

46:15.116 --> 46:18.220
Department of Helmet County had videotapes. And 
so he'd video the demonstrations. Yeah, we'd

46:22.225 --> 46:24.789
video the demonstrations. Yeah, that's another 
thing, because everybody started taking

46:24.809 --> 46:28.794
pictures at that time. On one side, they were all 
yelling police brutality and taking pictures.

46:33.039 --> 46:37.285
And on the other side, you guys were videotaping. I 
would imagine that had to do with court, didn't it?

46:40.651 --> 46:40.911
Oh, yeah. That was primarily what it was for. Or we 
could take, we knew a rock thrower. Yeah, right.

46:46.901 --> 46:52.110
And somebody would get hurt, and John would run the 
pictures by us, and we'd say, that's him. We'd

46:52.170 --> 46:53.653
circle it. And then we could go to court on it. That 
was evidence. Yeah.

47:10.056 --> 47:11.878
Yeah. That's why they took it away from us, I think, 
because it was effective. They took it away from

47:16.636 --> 47:18.680
you? Well, they haven't taken it away from us, no. 
Not totally. As a matter of fact, the video

47:21.225 --> 47:26.394
equipment, they have increased in the 
department. The photo lab, that was closed down.

47:28.919 --> 47:30.481
Well, when? I mean, after the confrontation? I 
mean, wasn't there, like, in the 70s sometime? No,

47:34.005 --> 47:37.129
this was just a year ago last July. Oh. A year ago 
this first month. But we just used to go out and take

47:41.234 --> 47:49.945
all the photographs, demonstrations, and then 
reprocessing the lab. And it'd be, you know, all

47:49.965 --> 47:53.830
sorts of issues.
