WEBVTT

00:03.372 --> 00:07.237
You want to give me my, no, you want to give me my 
choice? What? You want to give me my choice?

00:11.303 --> 00:16.190
Coffee, tea, oil? Yeah. Okay. Two? Please. 
Please. I've got to stay awake. What's wrong with

00:19.454 --> 00:20.816
you this afternoon? I had wine for lunch. I've 
always maintained the time to bomb Washington is

00:23.500 --> 00:28.227
at 1230, given the lunches I always make with 
Congress. I'm not kidding. I was with the

00:28.908 --> 00:29.909
Smithsonian. They really put a spread out. OK, 
now, the next series of questions I have to ask

00:33.410 --> 00:39.419
concern relationships with other agencies. And

00:40.080 --> 00:51.317
I'd like to tell you about the agency and then see 
what sort of input you think you had in direction or

00:40.080 --> 00:51.317
the direction the agency might happen to go. The 
NSF, what was your attitude or relationship

00:52.559 --> 00:59.330
towards the National Science Foundation? My 
attitude towards them has always been the same.

01:01.996 --> 01:06.586
The more involvement the foundation has in 
oceanography, the better the program will be. I

01:06.606 --> 01:17.811
see no competition between the foundation and 
anybody else, and was the key man who recommended

01:06.606 --> 01:17.811
the foundation take the Sea Grant program as 
opposed to Interior Commerce, who I didn't think,

01:06.606 --> 01:17.811
and still don't to this day, knows how to do 
anything outhouse. And that's history. It

01:20.217 --> 01:21.819
doesn't mean the people can't do it. It's just, you 
know, just the tradition of an organization like

01:21.859 --> 01:30.893
the Department of Commerce or the Department of 
Interior is just an internal, in-house type of

01:21.859 --> 01:30.893
organization. And I don't think you'd ever 
created an office of naval research type of

01:30.993 --> 01:38.685
environment, for example, had you ever started 
after the war in anybody but the Navy. And you can

01:39.104 --> 01:43.873
say the Navy's a bureaucratic organization, but 
the way they did that, that certainly came out on

01:39.104 --> 01:43.873
top. Well, I was going to ask about the ONR for a 
second. I just want to follow that up. People like

01:46.799 --> 01:54.394
Roger Revell, for example, give to the Navy total 
credit with the development both of the ONR and of

01:46.799 --> 01:54.394
oceanography. I take it you would agree with that? 
Initially, yes. Okay. So when time comes for the

01:58.021 --> 02:08.057
ONR to separate and, you know, not separate, 
that's too strong, but for the ONR to encourage the

01:58.021 --> 02:08.057
NSF to grow out of the ONR, after all, they did 
change in effect. Well, I didn't know that they

02:08.077 --> 02:09.420
encouraged it. I don't know who did that 
encouragement. I came on the scene after NSF was

02:10.982 --> 02:20.738
established and when there was some competition 
between NSF and ONR, but there was no competition

02:10.982 --> 02:20.738
at the high level, in oceanography and the highest 
level of the Navy very definitely encouraged both

02:21.055 --> 02:33.631
O and R to get better involved and deeper involved 
in oceanography and to get NSF deeper and more

02:21.055 --> 02:33.631
financially involved in oceanography. And I 
think we succeeded in that if you look at the

02:33.692 --> 02:44.025
percentages of the pie within O and R devoted to 
oceanography and the percentage of the pie within

02:33.692 --> 02:44.025
NSF devoted to oceanography. When you saw what 
seemed to be a competition when you came between

02:44.444 --> 02:55.318
ONR and NSF, what sort of competition or what did 
you think was the ingredient that caused the

02:44.444 --> 02:55.318
competition to occur? Like any other 
bureaucracy, ONR was very proud of its history and

02:56.179 --> 03:07.414
very proud of its accomplishments and should be 
and should have been, but wasn't paying that much

02:56.179 --> 03:07.414
attention to what it ought to be doing in a changing 
world. And therefore, I tried to get them out of

03:08.542 --> 03:15.391
nuclear physics and put the money in nuclear 
physics into oceanography, which I partially

03:08.542 --> 03:15.391
succeeded in, but didn't completely. Because I 
don't think in today's world, or even in the

03:16.192 --> 03:24.364
mid-'60s world, that one could have doubled the 
budget just by putting new money in it. When you

03:24.864 --> 03:28.710
make a decision like that, you have to figure out 
what you do in place of something. And that's

03:28.730 --> 03:31.253
sometimes the hardest decision. It's easy to say, 
if somebody gives me twice as much money, what I'm

03:31.734 --> 03:35.138
going to do. It's a lot more difficult if somebody 
says, all right, We feel this program is

03:38.174 --> 03:39.796
important. You can go ahead and do it if you want to. 
And that if you want to means you better kill

03:42.179 --> 03:48.027
something else in order to get it going.

03:48.047 --> 03:48.667
That's natural. That's human competition. And 
that's good. I felt that ONR was good. I still feel

03:55.536 --> 03:56.658
it is good. And the reason that I put the 
recommended and it was approved to put the Naval

03:56.698 --> 04:06.190
Research and Development Oceanographic 
Activity under the Chief of Naval Research was I

03:56.698 --> 04:06.190
think he's the best man to do the job. And I could 
have put it directly under me instead of under him

04:07.182 --> 04:13.250
under me, or I could have put it under the Chief of 
Naval Materials Organization or the Director of

04:07.182 --> 04:13.250
Navy Labs. I really believe that he's still the 
most competent to set up something that's that new

04:13.290 --> 04:22.722
in the world and that demanding and has that far to 
go. And I hope that that flexibility will remain

04:23.202 --> 04:26.967
with ONR. I don't know. It's hard to foresee what 
will happen in the future. Or what about NOAA?

04:32.410 --> 04:38.080
Well, NOAA was also, in the year I was gone, it was 
also changed from, I guess, ESSA to NOAA. In the

04:38.100 --> 04:44.851
early days in the 60s, I was trying to get, then it 
was what, the Coast and Geodetic Survey more

04:38.100 --> 04:44.851
involved. I think it was Mr. Wakeman who was active 
in the legislation to get them a three-star

04:45.752 --> 04:52.704
admiral's billet as an assistant administrator. 
I certainly appeared whenever I could with the

04:53.305 --> 04:58.654
then the Coast and Geodetic Survey to support 
their budgets. I still did before I was the NOAA

05:02.702 --> 05:05.225
deputy. I do not appear now as NOAA deputy, nor do I 
appear as oceanographer because they're so big

05:05.285 --> 05:15.494
and, comparatively speaking, and have so many 
things to do, I can't just find the time. But I sign

05:15.554 --> 05:18.156
letters that support their programs. I feel it's 
very critical that NOAA be involved in the ocean. I

05:23.861 --> 05:28.185
don't know that I would do it exactly the way that 
they're doing it. But I don't know their problems

05:29.347 --> 05:34.812
as much as well as I know either the Foundation's 
problems or the Navy's problems. I think I

05:34.872 --> 05:41.157
recognize NSF's problems in dealing with 
Congress and the Navy's problems. But I don't

05:42.318 --> 05:47.623
always understand NOAA's problems, because NOAA 
is a conglomerate within the Department of

05:42.318 --> 05:47.623
Commerce. I'm still a great supporter of NOAA 
trying to do the things that I think it ought to. And

05:52.247 --> 05:58.813
I was willing and, in fact, recommended that they 
not create the Defense Mapping Agency, but they

05:52.247 --> 05:58.813
create a web mapping agency. They either gave it to 
Noah or the Navy, and I would have voted giving it to

05:59.198 --> 06:02.522
Noah, finally. I really felt that the only 
safeguard I'd have on that is to set the priorities

06:03.163 --> 06:13.876
so that I could override priorities if it were a 
real hard thing to do. I had that arrangement with

06:13.916 --> 06:15.158
the Coast Guard. I was instrumental in giving the 
Coast Guard the Navy's icebreakers back in the

06:15.939 --> 06:20.124
60s. And everybody said, oh, if you give it to them, 
they'll never do the job for you. We'll never get

06:23.688 --> 06:26.792
this done, and we'll never get that done, and we'll 
never get the other done. And the commandant of the

06:27.533 --> 06:29.155
Coast Guard has always done what the Navy had to 
have done. Not what the Navy wanted to get done, but

06:34.833 --> 06:41.340
when you had a Polaris problem or something really 
emergency, they were right there on top of it. And I

06:41.360 --> 06:42.781
think it's come out very nicely. And I don't see any 
reason why the same type of arrangement couldn't

06:43.362 --> 06:46.845
be with NOAA. And we did transfer the data center to 
them, and we did transfer the instrument center. I

06:53.252 --> 06:53.893
think that They can do things a lot better. But 
don't forget, they're also a new agency. They're

06:58.515 --> 06:59.836
also growing rapidly. The outside world likes to 
think they're not growing rapidly. But if you look

07:02.859 --> 07:07.904
at their budget percentage-wise increase, it's 
been significant over the last four or five years.

07:09.205 --> 07:17.813
I'd like to see them do a better job of mapping, a 
better job of environmental prediction. And I'd

07:17.913 --> 07:21.437
like to see the Navy turn things over to that area or 
work with them. I'm trying to work with them on the

07:21.477 --> 07:23.779
engineering side. I have a dilemma here that it's 
not easy for me to give technology to a foreign

07:25.295 --> 07:33.008
country in an engineering sense. So I've been 
trying to not interfere with what they're doing

07:33.709 --> 07:38.397
there. On the other hand, I've committed to Dr. 
White to help him if he has a problem in

07:38.437 --> 07:43.265
engineering. And I have helped him in the man in the 
sea program and do provide significant liaison

07:43.305 --> 07:50.256
for that. I think there's a conflict between the 
agencies at the middle working level, but right at

07:52.025 --> 08:11.984
the present time and for the last two and a half 
years, I don't think I've seen a major conflict in

07:52.025 --> 08:11.984
the policy direction between NOAA and the Navy, 
with the possible exception of the Navy's view of

07:52.025 --> 08:11.984
technology exchange internationally versus 
NOAA's view. And I don't know that I speak for Dr.

08:12.865 --> 08:14.787
White. I know that the one echelon below, they'd 
like to give everything to everybody. And I don't,

08:18.891 --> 08:21.053
that's not a, agreed upon government position. 
The

08:24.199 --> 08:34.584
rest is a lot easier now than I know

08:24.199 --> 08:34.584
it. This is something that we sunk at midway that 
they dug back up and sunk us.

08:42.177 --> 08:55.774
Now, in terms of relationships with Congress, do 
you see your primary role in Congress with that as,

08:42.177 --> 08:55.774
if I may use the word, a lobbyist for Navy 
oceanography or as an expert witness coming in for

08:42.177 --> 08:55.774
Naval oceanography or both? I'd like to say I see it 
as a lobbyist, but I haven't been able to exercise

08:57.696 --> 09:01.280
that role. And the reason I haven't is because of 
the controversy that's really surrounded moving

09:01.300 --> 09:06.767
something out of Washington. I would like to do 
that because I think a lobbyist in the proper sense

09:07.456 --> 09:12.504
of the word is an important thing. I think it's 
something the Navy hasn't done. I think it's

09:15.869 --> 09:17.432
something the Navy should do. As far as being a 
technical witness is concerned, that's probably

09:18.453 --> 09:35.640
the role I've played over the last 15 years or 10 
years more than any other by merely trying to

09:18.453 --> 09:35.640
support the committees that are dealing in 
oceanography and not necessarily trying to lobby

09:18.453 --> 09:35.640
them for the Navy because they aren't the people 
who give the Navy the money. And I have never

09:36.160 --> 09:40.506
appeared before the Navy's own committees but 
once. I appeared as a commander in the mid-'60s in

09:40.586 --> 10:00.053
an attempt to get extra money for Navy ocean 
engineering, deep submergence, and believe it or

09:40.586 --> 10:00.053
not, was successful and was, I believe, one of the 
few times Mr. McNamara let the department accept

09:40.586 --> 10:00.053
an amount of money given to them over and above the 
president's budget by the Congress. And it was $10

10:00.073 --> 10:02.336
million, if I remember correctly. It may have only 
been five, but it wasn't a lot of money. It seemed

10:05.742 --> 10:07.363
like a lot of money to me at the time. And it occurred 
right at the time we just recovered the hydrogen

10:08.444 --> 10:12.768
bomb. I remember that because I remember the 
briefing I gave. And I didn't give it as

10:15.811 --> 10:17.052
oceanography. I gave it as special assistant to 
the secretary. I prepare testimony for

10:20.655 --> 10:25.059
everybody, but I personally don't go before the 
Navy's own committees. But I do go personally

10:25.119 --> 10:35.428
before the committees that are outside of the 
armed services, such as the Senate and the House

10:25.119 --> 10:35.428
committees that deal in oceanography. and I do 
that in a technical sense, lobbying for

10:37.028 --> 10:42.233
oceanography in general and not lobbying for 
oceanography for the Navy. Although if somebody

10:42.594 --> 10:47.499
asks me if the Navy can do a better job in this than 
somebody else, I'll tell them the truth, and some

10:42.594 --> 10:47.499
people don't like this. If somebody asks me if the 
Navy can do a better job in charting than NOAA, I'll

10:47.579 --> 10:54.646
say, hell no, NOAA can do a better job. If the Navy 
says to me, somebody says, can the Navy do a better

10:55.067 --> 11:01.213
job than the man in the sea, I'll say, hell yes, 
because it can. It's got 4,000 people at sea, and I

11:01.333 --> 11:04.757
can give you all the reasons why it can do a better 
job. Now, there may be bureaucratic reasons why

11:05.345 --> 11:10.773
the Navy ought not to do something, and that enters 
into it, and I think I'm pretty honest about that. I

11:11.734 --> 11:17.202
think that you've got to put the Navy in it to get it 
started, but you don't want to keep the Navy in it.

11:17.222 --> 11:20.186
And I think this is really what's happened in ocean 
science, too. The Navy started it, and the Navy's

11:20.206 --> 11:28.378
not the major player now, but I think the Navy's 
still a major player, but not the major player. And

11:28.398 --> 11:30.381
we have an abandoned ship, if you know what I mean. 
On the other hand, we've let the Foundation take

11:30.401 --> 11:34.407
the lead, and yet we're working together with 
them. I see no conflict in that because there's so

11:35.180 --> 11:38.544
much to be done. And I don't think a naval officer 
such as myself is trying to perpetuate his own

11:39.585 --> 11:44.771
bureaucracy. That doesn't mean I'm pure, but I 
think there's less incentive for me to do it than

11:45.632 --> 11:57.366
there is for somebody who makes a career out of a 
bureaucracy, although I've now been accused of

11:45.632 --> 11:57.366
it, as I'm sure you recognize. Now, in terms of 
development of of your department of

11:59.918 --> 12:06.265
oceanography here in effect in this ocean, what 
would you say were the most important

11:59.918 --> 12:06.265
accomplishments? I mean, what time frame? Oh, 
from between 60 and 75, the 15 years you've been

12:09.228 --> 12:12.932
here. What are the things you're... Well, I don't 
take credit for all of them by a long shot. I would

12:17.617 --> 12:24.205
say in the 60s, the major accomplishment was a 
significant increase in the academic program in

12:17.617 --> 12:24.205
oceanography and the training of 
oceanographers. I think the 60s, what we did in the

12:24.305 --> 12:29.250
universities gave us the capability, assured the 
this nation or this government ever really go into

12:29.770 --> 12:36.959
the sea in a big way, we have the qualified and 
capable people. That's what we got academically

12:36.979 --> 12:38.961
out of the 60s. We got new ships, and we sort of 
rebuilt up the fleet from World War II in

12:39.822 --> 12:44.968
oceanography. We moved into deep submergence and 
ocean engineering in a big way for the first time,

12:45.930 --> 12:58.765
and I think got to a very significant position 
before we all of a sudden in the late 60s, like 68,

12:45.930 --> 12:58.765
69, stopped doing much of anything. I think in the, 
and we began to bring people together in the 60s.

13:04.672 --> 13:10.580
The Interagency Committee on Oceanography and 
even the Marine Science Council and those things,

13:04.672 --> 13:10.580
I think, started to bring people together. I think 
in the 70s what we accomplished, what we

13:10.600 --> 13:19.352
accomplished interagency-wise was the creation 
of a very fine consolidation of the foundation and

13:19.889 --> 13:33.714
the Navy and NOAA Sea Grant in not under one 
management but under a understanding management

13:19.889 --> 13:33.714
and a cooperative effort in which I do work with 
them and we do know what they do and they do know what

13:19.889 --> 13:33.714
we do. I think the other incentive or not incentive 
but I think the other some of the things that we've

13:34.656 --> 13:42.049
done that I think are very worthwhile are the 
constant effort to declassify military

13:42.502 --> 13:45.807
information. I think if that weren't run by the 
Secretary's office, you'd never get it done

13:45.847 --> 13:52.537
because the military mind always likes to say, 
keep out of my hair. I think that the creation of the

13:53.519 --> 13:59.808
navigational satellite system has been 
absolutely magnificent from both a scientific

13:53.519 --> 13:59.808
and engineering viewpoint. And that came out of 
the Polaris program. I think the work that was done

14:02.112 --> 14:11.766
in the fleet ballistic missile system for 
hydrographic upgrading of the multi-beam echo

14:02.112 --> 14:11.766
sounder for the accuracy and the building of the 
newer submersibles and the accomplishment of

14:12.252 --> 14:25.508
being able to start getting some instrumentation 
and hardware in deep submergence and undersea

14:12.252 --> 14:25.508
technology were accomplishments then. The 70s 
accomplishments were only the one between the

14:25.568 --> 14:41.348
foundation and I suppose the rest of the 
accomplishments are those contained within the

14:25.568 --> 14:41.348
Navy in an attempt to try to crystallize the Navy's 
program and attempt to try to put it in a better

14:25.568 --> 14:41.348
perspective I think I have lost in many of my 
objectives. I think my objective of bringing the

14:44.435 --> 14:49.763
meteorologists and the oceanographer together 
was very selfish. It was to broaden the base of

14:49.823 --> 14:56.251
manpower within the Navy, and that has been 
accomplished about a year ahead of schedule. The

14:56.271 --> 15:04.062
ability to consolidate in a geographical 
location was a long, hard fight, and that's not

14:56.271 --> 15:04.062
over yet, but it's one third over. I think the 
ability to get the management consolidation,

15:04.818 --> 15:11.985
which is not geographic, but to bring everybody 
working together is the next fight in the scene.

15:12.745 --> 15:24.036
And the one that I've lost, which hurts me the most, 
is getting new capital investment objectives

15:12.745 --> 15:24.036
from the Navy Department to be able to help both the 
academic community and the Navy. And I think,

15:24.056 --> 15:28.940
unfortunately,

15:24.056 --> 15:28.940
that's lost in my time. If I'm lucky, I might be able 
to get something authorized, but it'll never be

15:28.980 --> 15:34.285
completed in my tour. Now, when the consolidation 
process, of which you've run, do you think,

15:36.087 --> 15:43.055
roughly one-third, do you think... I'm sorry. Let 
me try it this way. What will be the goals of the

15:47.200 --> 15:53.067
operation in Gulfport that will be different than 
your present goals? To ensure that all of the

15:53.087 --> 16:01.417
Navy's effort in what we call ocean science, and 
you'd have to look at the instruction that talks

15:53.087 --> 16:01.417
about this because it's not academic science. It 
goes a lot beyond that. are fully integrated and

16:03.188 --> 16:11.037
coordinated, but not necessarily physically put 
in Gulfport, but are integrated with the effort of

16:03.188 --> 16:11.037
the academic community. Not to drive the effort of 
the academic community, but have them working

16:11.098 --> 16:19.407
together towards a common understanding of the 
ultimate mathematical model of the world's

16:11.098 --> 16:19.407
ocean. Now, you and I know we're not going to get 
from here to there, but that's the objective, and

16:20.429 --> 16:30.681
if you put your sight on that objective, even if you 
don't agree you can do such a thing, you can get an

16:20.429 --> 16:30.681
approximation to it, We're all going to be better 
off, the fishermen, the merchant marine, the

16:31.167 --> 16:40.737
Navy, the submarine community, the weapons 
community, and the exploiting community such as

16:31.167 --> 16:40.737
the oil industry and the other. In the prediction 
arena, that's to take what we learned from the

16:42.058 --> 16:46.903
science and get it out to the user. The Navy's not 
doing too bad a job with that right now. I'd like to

16:50.127 --> 16:54.411
be able to take that and get it out to all the users, 
not just the Navy users. I'd like to do better

16:54.952 --> 16:58.035
within the Navy, but I'd like to also get it out to 
the other users. And that's hard to do because a lot

17:00.454 --> 17:04.123
of people suspect what you're doing when you do 
that. But it's still worth a college try. And by

17:06.950 --> 17:11.080
physically putting the director of that 
organization in the Navy in a geographical office

17:12.157 --> 17:20.107
next door to the scientific world plus in-house 
development world, that may achieve what I hope it

17:12.157 --> 17:20.107
will achieve. Then I take it that your hope is that 
the proximity of the people located in one spot

17:21.769 --> 17:31.160
will increase the efficiency and cooperation of 
your unit. That's true, but it's got to be more than

17:31.180 --> 17:32.782
that. You've got to direct them so that most of 
their work is going towards the objectives you

17:33.083 --> 17:40.712
want them to go for and not spending so much time 
either fighting with each other or doing their own

17:41.013 --> 17:44.358
little administrative thing. Now, the last 
series of interview questions I have on the fourth

17:44.819 --> 17:59.681
quarter interview are some general comments 
about naval career and naval civilian

17:44.819 --> 17:59.681
cooperation, if I may use that word.

18:01.083 --> 18:10.277
First of all, in the 20th century Navy, if I may, do 
you see more of a move in the Navy into disciplines

18:01.083 --> 18:10.277
like oceanography, away from ship lines? No, I 
don't. I saw more of that in the 60s, and I've seen

18:12.689 --> 18:15.533
that sort of taper off. I've seen the Navy attempt 
to go to the route of specialization in discipline

18:15.573 --> 18:27.310
fields, and then I've seen the Navy now in the last 
two years head back towards what you do at sea is

18:15.573 --> 18:27.310
what counts. I'm very disappointed in that 
because the Navy's a damn big corporation, and it

18:27.370 --> 18:39.167
takes a lot of qualified people, and I'd like to see 
some of those qualified people military, even

18:27.370 --> 18:39.167
though I've been the one guy that pushed hard to 
civilianize the The oceanographic programming

18:39.586 --> 18:49.179
have achieved most of that, but I still think that 
if you're going to run a Navy, the Naval officer

18:39.586 --> 18:49.179
better know enough about it to be able to run it. But 
there's a danger there, and that is in a discipline

18:49.219 --> 18:55.647
like this, you have to stay so long you can 
jeopardize your own career militarily. I think

18:56.568 --> 18:57.670
many people have. I think that's probably why Don 
Walsh left the Navy. I think he loved the Navy, but I

19:00.273 --> 19:07.202
think he felt he just spent too much time in 
oceanography and he couldn't compete with the...

19:07.222 --> 19:09.525
I'd have to ask him, but that's my outside 
assessment. Okay, so you see now what seemed to be

19:10.180 --> 19:20.196
the swing of the Navy in the 60s to integrate more 
and more managerial and scientific aspects now

19:10.180 --> 19:20.196
back to the ship-of-the-line approach. That's 
what I see. Whether that's accurate or not, that's

19:21.198 --> 19:23.641
certainly what I see. All right. Secondly, in 
terms of naval attitudes, would you agree that in

19:24.543 --> 19:37.183
terms of oceanography that you see more 
oceanographic work in, let's say, mapping,

19:24.543 --> 19:37.183
charting?

19:39.037 --> 19:46.148
and deep sea work than you did in what seemed to be a 
generalized approach to oceanography in the 60s?

19:46.168 --> 19:46.228
No. That is oceanography becoming more 
specialized or less specialized? Today I'd see it

19:49.853 --> 19:53.038
becoming less specialized than it was before. I 
think before it tended to give the appearance of

19:53.058 --> 19:56.924
being specialized. I think today there's been 
enough naval officers that have gone through

19:56.984 --> 20:04.555
graduate school and been exposed to it to 
recognize we know so little that they just can't.

20:05.260 --> 20:20.778
narrow their focus, and I don't think they all know 
what they want, but I think there's quite a few

20:05.260 --> 20:20.778
naval officers around in the Admiral Circuit that 
either have sons in oceanography or have seen what

20:05.260 --> 20:20.778
it can do for them that give them at least a feel that 
it's important, although they can't necessarily

20:05.260 --> 20:20.778
articulate why it's important, nor would they put 
their own money in it. But at least I think we've

20:20.798 --> 20:26.965
made that progress, and that's a carryover from 
the 60s when we educated people, I think. Do you see

20:27.046 --> 20:31.813
any increase in hostility towards the military 
establishment? By whom? On the part of either

20:34.497 --> 20:37.041
Congress or civilians. I don't. A lot of people say 
that's going to happen. But I've seen them come

20:39.965 --> 20:44.893
through what I consider a huge hostility during 
the Vietnam era. And I've seen that hostility

20:45.473 --> 20:48.798
shift towards industrial corporations. And I was 
talking to Mr. Mellon up in Pittsburgh about a year

20:48.818 --> 20:52.564
ago on that subject. And I've also seen arguments 
that say that the Congress is very much against the

20:53.894 --> 20:58.981
military. I think that's not exactly the case. I 
think what you are seeing is the newer congressmen

21:00.864 --> 21:05.551
have not served in the military. Therefore, 
they're not that familiar with it, number one.

21:08.576 --> 21:15.987
Number two, their demands for national medical 
programs and social programs, that someday

21:08.576 --> 21:15.987
they're going to wake up. You can't have always 
both things. And I think this is going to affect the

21:18.050 --> 21:22.416
military budget I would hope that it wouldn't 
affect the Navy as much as it would the Army or the

21:22.700 --> 21:28.108
Air Force, but you never can tell. But I don't see an 
open animosity. I see, I'm just as welcome, I'm

21:30.752 --> 21:40.406
more welcome right now than I was in the 69, 70 
timeframe, but not as much as I was in the 63 to 66

21:30.752 --> 21:40.406
timeframe. If you had any advice to young career 
officers to begin here in the Navy, what would you

21:42.228 --> 21:47.195
say? Would you say, go back to your alma mater, come 
into the Navy this way, be a regular naval man? You

21:52.518 --> 21:54.420
mean instead of going to the Naval Academy or what? 
I mean to go to the Naval Academy and come through or

21:54.440 --> 21:56.964
what? Oh, I think the best way to advise a young man 
is to go to the Naval Academy and then take your

21:56.984 --> 22:02.911
graduate education somewhere outside of the 
Naval Academy. That gives you the best of both

22:03.572 --> 22:05.715
worlds, in my opinion. But you still think 
graduate education is necessary? My own personal

22:08.458 --> 22:19.032
opinion is a naval officer is in a world that's so 
highly technical and so highly different from the

22:08.458 --> 22:19.032
rest of the world and its rapidity with its 
technology moves and a man who is not have advanced

22:19.535 --> 22:26.766
education in today's world is just not the kind of 
guy I'd want to have if I had my ways about it. And I

22:26.806 --> 22:37.002
think that it has another side benefit, and that is 
if you choose after 20 years to say to hell with the

22:26.806 --> 22:37.002
Navy, you've got some confidence to do some work on 
the outside. I think it's an incentive program. If

22:38.384 --> 22:46.757
I had my way, every enlisted man would get a college 
degree or a technical degree by the time he

22:38.384 --> 22:46.757
finished his 20 years, and every naval officer 
would have at least a master's degree. and I

22:47.328 --> 22:53.354
wouldn't let them go on and make captain if they 
didn't, and I wouldn't let an enlisted man extend

22:47.328 --> 22:53.354
beyond his 20, and I think I owed it to him. But then 
I'm not, that's my position, and that is not an

22:53.374 --> 22:58.839
agreed upon position, because a lot of people 
think I'm crazy about that. But I really think in

22:59.460 --> 23:08.889
today's world that this corporation, which is 30 
some billion dollars a year, needs a highly

22:59.460 --> 23:08.889
competent technical group of people working for 
it. All right, now then, what, have you had any

23:08.909 --> 23:15.175
recommendations to young oceanographers? What 
would you suggest? Military or civilian?

23:18.111 --> 23:19.012
Civilian oceanography. Stay away from marine 
biology. All right. Stay away from marine

23:21.436 --> 23:22.057
biology. And the reason I say that is because most 
of the people who have come into oceanography have

23:22.077 --> 23:31.633
come into it in the sense of the Jacques Cousteau 
world of the fishing and the diving. And I think

23:32.234 --> 23:36.741
that oceanography is important and absolutely 
essential. But it's not an easy subject. It is not a

23:38.667 --> 23:40.449
basket weaving course. It's a hard subject. 
You've got to understand your math. You've got to

23:43.092 --> 23:44.533
understand your physics. You've got to 
understand what goes on in the ocean. And I don't

23:46.515 --> 23:50.199
think you can do it by buying a scuba gear and just 
playing. And I think that a lot of the young people

23:50.219 --> 23:56.465
tend to think that's the costos world of 
oceanography is the world they want to be a part of.

23:56.885 --> 23:58.286
That's a fringe benefit to me. But that's not why 
you ought to be doing it. And I'm having that

24:00.529 --> 24:02.250
problem with the Naval Academy. And I'm having 
that problem with postgraduate school and trying

24:02.270 --> 24:06.154
to harden up the math and the physics in the 
curricula because we're getting a reputation

24:06.505 --> 24:15.668
these days of being a bunch of easygoing

24:06.505 --> 24:15.668
diving people. And I think that's bad for both the 
community and I think that's bad for the Navy. And I

24:18.676 --> 24:20.059
think it's true in both sides. So when you look at a 
young student to bring him into your department

24:20.174 --> 24:30.285
here, if you civilianize your department, do you 
hunt for somebody with training in hard math and

24:20.174 --> 24:30.285
physics? Well, I take biologists, too, but I think 
we're producing about three to one, three

24:30.305 --> 24:38.554
biologists for every man with a hard math 
background, and I think that it ought to be exactly

24:30.305 --> 24:38.554
the opposite ratio. There ought to be three or four 
to one with a hard math ratio. And even in the

24:42.238 --> 24:45.422
fishing and biology business, hard math has sure 
helped. Because we're in the dark age as far as

24:46.111 --> 24:48.494
biology is concerned. We're still using that 
plankton net that I think was invented in the 18th

24:48.514 --> 24:52.659
century. And yet we've done much better in the 
other areas. We're digitized and we're looking.

24:56.945 --> 24:58.066
And I don't see why we can't.

25:00.890 --> 25:06.457
That's a personal opinion, but I think a lot of the 
universities are beginning to see you've got to do

25:00.890 --> 25:06.457
the same sort of thing. And I think we're all coming 
about to the same point. Jack Cousteau is the

25:09.521 --> 25:12.304
greatest contribution that I can think of to 
oceanography because I had he and his wife at the

25:12.588 --> 25:19.299
Secretary's mess, and that's how I sold the 
Secretary of the Navy into putting more money in

25:12.588 --> 25:19.299
oceanography. But that's salesmanship. That's 
lobbying. We've got to produce now, and I think

25:22.244 --> 25:29.557
we've got to have a lot more sophisticated 
background than to be able to use the modern

25:22.244 --> 25:29.557
technology to be able to produce. That's my own 
personal opinion. Now, I have one other question,

25:31.252 --> 25:41.944
and that is, if someone came to you and said, 
Admiral Snyder, what's been your greatest

25:31.252 --> 25:41.944
contribution in terms of your career in the Navy 
and in oceanography? In the Navy or in

25:41.964 --> 25:43.466
oceanography? In the Navy first and in 
oceanography, one, two. I don't know. I don't

25:48.111 --> 25:50.814
think it's easy to ever say what you've 
contributed in the Navy. I know what my happiest

25:51.555 --> 25:57.141
job was and my most rewarding job was, and that was, 
interestingly enough, in Vietnam. where I had a

25:58.032 --> 26:02.458
ship and every Marine and every soldier was 
convinced that I saved his life. And that's a

26:02.618 --> 26:04.560
pretty rewarding thing. So that's hard to beat. In 
the technical side, if I get it consolidated and if

26:06.783 --> 26:17.697
I get it under everybody working together, that 
will be a major accomplishment that nobody else

26:06.783 --> 26:17.697
has ever been able to do. And I don't even know 
whether I can do it or not and get everybody working

26:17.757 --> 26:21.061
together. I'm heading in that direction. I hope to 
be able to say that when I leave that that I have

26:24.442 --> 26:28.648
accomplished, at least set the stage for it going 
forward. I guess that's about all I can say,

26:30.991 --> 26:40.004
because I think that in an organization this 
large, we tend to think one individual is able to

26:30.991 --> 26:40.004
make that significant a contribution. But I think 
that the realities of life are that the only

26:40.084 --> 26:46.012
contribution I've made is persistence and 
obnoxiousness. And unfortunately, on occasion,

26:46.733 --> 26:50.078
you can stand one guy in 1,000 who's that way.
