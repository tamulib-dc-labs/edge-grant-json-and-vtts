WEBVTT

00:02.680 --> 00:04.562
with Colonel Boatner, did you?

00:04.582 --> 00:05.103
No, sir.

00:05.483 --> 00:06.665
He said, yes, sir, no, sir.

00:06.685 --> 00:07.065
That was it.

00:07.085 --> 00:16.997
And I remember he, this sophomore said something, and he just leaned over his desk and started pounding like that and said, typical goddamn Aggie.

00:17.978 --> 00:20.761
So that was one of his sayings, you know.

00:21.022 --> 00:25.747
And he went on to Korea during the Korean War.

00:26.048 --> 00:29.852
He was assistant division commander, and he,

00:30.997 --> 00:34.241
Then they pulled him out because he was an old China hand.

00:34.321 --> 00:38.087
He had been in China back in the 30s and spoke Chinese.

00:38.747 --> 00:45.877
So they pulled him out and put him on Koji Do Island where he, the prisoners were rioting there and they had taken over the island.

00:45.957 --> 00:51.525
He came in and he got them back, got them shaped back up.

00:51.545 --> 00:54.709
And the story goes, now I've heard this, I don't know if it's true or not,

00:54.858 --> 01:01.147
Somebody said, asked him about, you know, how bad was it or was that a tough assignment?

01:01.167 --> 01:07.256
He said, well, listen, after handling the Corps of Cadets and the Aggie Moms Club, you know, this was easy.

01:08.057 --> 01:09.539
So that's the story they tell.

01:09.619 --> 01:10.541
I don't know if that's true.

01:10.561 --> 01:13.104
But anyway, he died a few years ago.

01:13.124 --> 01:18.412
But you and your buddies were not surprised that he could take charge of those.

01:18.432 --> 01:18.733
No, no, no.

01:18.773 --> 01:19.674
We laughed about it.

01:19.694 --> 01:23.920
We said, boy, if they wanted to send somebody in, he was the right guy to send in.

01:24.102 --> 01:25.583
Now, was Molloy an Aggie?

01:26.484 --> 01:27.846
No, they were both West Pointers.

01:27.906 --> 01:30.368
Molloy and Boatner were West Pointers.

01:30.448 --> 01:38.637
In fact, Molloy's son started the A&M in about 47, I think, was only here one year, then he went to West Point.

01:38.857 --> 01:40.058
He later became a general.

01:40.178 --> 01:43.081
I saw him over the years as a general.

01:43.802 --> 01:50.008
Was there anything you all did in the Corps then that was very different from now?

01:52.418 --> 01:54.403
Actually, the Corps hadn't changed that much.

01:54.423 --> 01:55.445
Okay, that's what I thought.

01:55.465 --> 02:04.566
I was trying to think of their... One thing, we had rifles, and we used to drill with rifles and that sort of thing, but they don't have that now.

02:04.586 --> 02:06.951
What vintage were those rifles?

02:07.522 --> 02:12.750
Well, I know we had, at one time, we had M1, the Garand.

02:13.090 --> 02:14.092
So that'd be World War II.

02:14.312 --> 02:15.714
Well, they were World War II rifles.

02:15.954 --> 02:20.361
And I'm not sure if we had Enfields and Springfields to begin with.

02:20.761 --> 02:21.482
I can't remember.

02:21.522 --> 02:26.710
I think we had the M1 rifle the whole time.

02:26.990 --> 02:31.797
And the uniforms y'all wore in the Corps were pretty close to, similar to what they are now.

02:31.918 --> 02:32.278
Well, no.

02:32.358 --> 02:36.364
We started out with OD, the freshman and sophomore,

02:37.407 --> 02:43.654
sophomores wore OD uniforms and the junior and seniors wore the green surge.

02:43.674 --> 02:44.174
Oh, that's right.

02:44.194 --> 02:45.876
Pinks and greens for seniors.

02:45.896 --> 02:46.156
That's right.

02:46.176 --> 02:51.922
And we wore the old World War II type blouse with blue lapels on it.

02:51.942 --> 02:54.125
That was ROTC had blue lapels.

02:54.145 --> 03:01.272
And then at the end of our freshman year, they decided they would do away with the blue lapels.

03:01.252 --> 03:08.005
and put us into all green, you know, green jacket and green pants, similar to the uniform today.

03:08.025 --> 03:10.590
Of course, everybody said, you know, Corps is going to hell.

03:11.191 --> 03:12.313
I mean, this is the end.

03:12.974 --> 03:18.064
Anytime you let freshmen wear sophomore uniforms, well now they're wearing senior uniforms.

03:18.365 --> 03:20.188
What were senior uniforms when I was

03:20.168 --> 03:21.029
when I was here.

03:22.852 --> 03:25.556
But, you know, it wasn't a very good uniform.

03:25.576 --> 03:28.179
We didn't get too many uniforms, and then we wore khakis.

03:28.580 --> 03:30.663
But one thing we never had, we never had shoes.

03:30.743 --> 03:31.864
They never issued shoes.

03:31.925 --> 03:40.196
So we had a, the Corps would line up, and they'd have every variety of, it didn't have to be brown, but every variety of brown shoes that you could imagine.

03:40.236 --> 03:41.698
When did that change, do you know?

03:41.718 --> 03:42.179
I don't know.

03:42.419 --> 03:45.003
When I came back in 77, they were issuing shoes.

03:46.064 --> 03:48.348
I didn't know about that variety.

03:48.448 --> 03:49.990
And they didn't, they didn't,

03:51.607 --> 03:55.233
For a while, they didn't issue field jackets, and you had to buy your own field jackets.

03:55.253 --> 03:57.897
So we had all kind of varieties of field jackets.

03:57.937 --> 04:00.481
So most of them were short, like tanker's jackets.

04:00.661 --> 04:09.395
Now, were the senior cavalry trousers dressed, were they the same then as they are now?

04:09.595 --> 04:13.181
They were the same, except they had genuine leather on the inside.

04:13.581 --> 04:16.786
And you know, we very seldom ever wore our boots.

04:17.167 --> 04:17.848
That's what I thought.

04:18.209 --> 04:19.791
We wore them at parades.

04:20.142 --> 04:21.824
We wore them at football games.

04:22.045 --> 04:22.826
But not to class.

04:22.866 --> 04:23.407
On court trips.

04:23.447 --> 04:24.669
Never wore them to class.

04:26.371 --> 04:28.274
We just didn't wear them except when we had to.

04:28.454 --> 04:30.477
Did you wear them to a formal dance?

04:30.617 --> 04:32.039
Well, formal dances, yeah.

04:32.059 --> 04:33.281
Formals, yeah.

04:33.301 --> 04:35.805
But only on special occasions would you wear your boots.

04:36.225 --> 04:43.516
Do you have any special memories about freshman, sophomore, final reviews?

04:43.536 --> 04:44.277
Well, I know that

04:44.965 --> 04:50.193
The final review for the end of my freshman year was a great year because we wore a fish stripe.

04:50.213 --> 04:58.986
In fact, class of 50 was the last class to wear the fish strap, which is a white band just above your cuff, right at the top of your cuff.

04:59.006 --> 05:03.012
And, of course, what we did, we took those off and then we put white tape around there.

05:03.113 --> 05:11.005
So after we went around the first time, then we all ripped off the white tape and we no longer wore, you know, fish.

05:11.806 --> 05:13.909
Got rid of our fish stripe.

05:14.024 --> 05:17.929
And drill was, it was held, final review held on the drill field.

05:17.969 --> 05:18.910
On the drill field, yes.

05:18.950 --> 05:22.914
Do you remember whether any famous World War II general review?

05:23.475 --> 05:28.201
Well, Eisenhower came down one time, I think, and was here.

05:28.241 --> 05:31.665
And then we had, Audie Murphy was here one time for.

05:31.685 --> 05:33.807
Do you remember what happened when those?

05:33.827 --> 05:35.509
They, well, they made honor.

05:35.877 --> 05:39.363
Audie Murphy, an honorary lieutenant colonel in the Corps, I remember that.

05:39.864 --> 05:45.974
I don't remember about Eisenhower or the other, you know, I think we had the governor or somebody over here.

05:48.358 --> 05:51.844
At that time, all that didn't impress me very much.

05:52.533 --> 06:11.487
We had lived in, until I was 10, we lived in Garland, then a country farming town, and my uncle ran a little gas station on the east edge of town, and in 47, 48, before he became completely a famous celebrity, Audie Murphy drove a car in one day, and here was a great big old guy, all beat up,

06:11.467 --> 06:21.197
And Audie had given this guy, a hitchhiker, a ride, and he tried to pull a gun on him and stick him up, and Audie beat the heck out of him.

06:22.017 --> 06:27.523
The, let's see, and for basketball, G. Raleigh wasn't built yet?

06:27.843 --> 06:28.404
No, DeWare.

06:28.684 --> 06:29.104
DeWare.

06:29.224 --> 06:29.645
DeWare.

06:29.825 --> 06:32.608
And did y'all, did you guys make that a noisy place?

06:33.088 --> 06:33.949
Well, yeah, yeah.

06:33.969 --> 06:36.191
It was, of course, it's so small, you know.

06:36.392 --> 06:36.832
We did.

06:37.112 --> 06:37.913
And you would fill it?

06:39.142 --> 06:40.925
Usually that was a pretty good crowd.

06:42.227 --> 06:44.771
What did you and your buddies think about Aggie Yell leaders?

06:44.851 --> 06:54.007
Were they, was that a highly desirable, oh, for the guys that got it, it was highly desirable, but I never did want to be a Yell leader.

06:55.429 --> 06:57.893
You know, it was a prestigious job.

06:58.784 --> 07:02.469
What was the most prestigious student leadership position?

07:02.729 --> 07:04.511
Well I always thought it was company commander.

07:05.012 --> 07:07.415
That's what I wanted to be and I did get to be that.

07:07.535 --> 07:09.057
And of course a Ross volunteer.

07:09.197 --> 07:16.867
That was one reason I studied so hard in my sophomore years to bring my grade point ratio up where I could get in the Ross volunteers.

07:16.907 --> 07:20.792
Were you, in those days were you selected at the end of your sophomore year?

07:21.532 --> 07:23.917
Beginning of your junior year.

07:23.937 --> 07:25.300
Beginning of your junior year.

07:25.320 --> 07:26.943
About how many were selected each?

07:27.264 --> 07:27.624
I think 72.

07:27.644 --> 07:30.470
72 new juniors?

07:30.711 --> 07:31.212
Yeah.

07:31.572 --> 07:34.418
How did you know you even had a chance?

07:34.578 --> 07:35.480
Did you apply?

07:35.500 --> 07:38.587
As far as I know, you applied for it.

07:39.328 --> 07:41.312
And how did you learn you had been selected?

07:42.760 --> 07:44.001
Somebody notified you.

07:44.021 --> 07:44.442
I don't know.

07:44.522 --> 07:48.005
You don't remember whether you... I don't remember.

07:48.025 --> 07:50.227
And how did you feel when you put that uniform on?

07:50.247 --> 07:51.028
Well, I felt great.

07:51.168 --> 07:52.949
You know, that was one of the things I wanted to do.

07:52.989 --> 07:55.171
Because see, my uncle had been in an RV.

07:55.231 --> 07:57.553
See, so I wanted to be in an RV.

07:57.574 --> 08:00.016
Now, did you have to buy your own outfit?

08:00.036 --> 08:00.356
Yeah, yeah.

08:00.376 --> 08:01.557
Had to buy your own uniform.

08:01.737 --> 08:03.299
And is there only one?

08:03.339 --> 08:04.720
There's not a winter and a summer?

08:04.860 --> 08:05.040
No.

08:05.701 --> 08:06.241
All white.

08:06.662 --> 08:08.964
And it has, that uniform has not changed?

08:09.064 --> 08:10.185
It hadn't changed.

08:10.739 --> 08:16.324
I tried, as a commandant, I tried to get them to change from black shoes to white shoes.

08:17.005 --> 08:18.826
And I said, we'll buy them for you.

08:18.886 --> 08:22.329
We'll issue them out of the MPC over there.

08:25.232 --> 08:26.834
Now, RVs would go to hell if they did that.

08:27.714 --> 08:28.215
Old Army.

08:28.575 --> 08:33.540
Do you remember, as an RV, some special events that you got to attend as an RV?

08:34.641 --> 08:39.565
Well, we did a, not really.

08:40.372 --> 08:41.595
We didn't go to New Orleans.

08:41.615 --> 08:43.619
This was before they went to New Orleans.

08:44.822 --> 08:51.496
And I can't remember much, doing much of anything except on Mother's Day, which is now Parents Weekend.

08:51.656 --> 08:57.008
On Mother's Day we farmed and then we did some honor guards for people.

08:57.329 --> 08:59.393
I can't remember who we did them for.

08:59.525 --> 09:04.353
And, of course, we had the RV ball and RV banquet and things like that.

09:04.393 --> 09:06.556
Did you go over for governor's inauguration?

09:06.716 --> 09:06.897
No.

09:07.418 --> 09:07.958
Oh, boy.

09:09.281 --> 09:10.623
Did the RVs march?

09:11.524 --> 09:15.951
They didn't march as a separate unit on court trips, did they?

09:15.971 --> 09:16.192
No, no, no.

09:16.212 --> 09:23.824
Now, my senior year, I went inactive because I was working on the Aggieland, and that was almost a full-time job.

09:23.904 --> 09:27.169
Any time I wasn't in class, I was overworking on that, and I just didn't have time

09:27.368 --> 09:30.752
Did you end up being the editor of the Aggieland?

09:30.772 --> 09:31.673
Yeah, I was the co-editor.

09:31.713 --> 09:36.279
They had a civilian student editor and a military, you know, corps.

09:36.299 --> 09:36.620
Poor guy.

09:36.840 --> 09:39.183
Tell me as much about the Aggieland as you can.

09:39.303 --> 09:40.064
Tell this machine.

09:40.524 --> 09:41.345
About the Aggieland?

09:41.365 --> 09:47.453
Yeah, and what all it involved, and who was the advisor, and what all did y'all do?

09:48.007 --> 09:51.912
You know, one of the big things, getting people to take their, have their picture made.

09:51.972 --> 10:04.167
And then we had the different sections and we had an editor, like the military section and sports, and Chuck Cabaniss was my co-editor, but he took over the sports.

10:04.227 --> 10:08.993
We couldn't find anybody to do the sports, so he did the sports, which left me with everything else.

10:09.333 --> 10:11.736
So I was the editor and he was the sports editor.

10:11.783 --> 10:13.325
But we were co-editoring names.

10:14.767 --> 10:18.653
And it involved trying to get people to work for you.

10:18.693 --> 10:22.879
You know, we'd have them come up one afternoon and you'd have five different crews.

10:23.901 --> 10:30.490
And they would come up and we'd, of course, we had to cut the pictures, paste them on the, all this was done manually.

10:30.530 --> 10:33.394
Paste them on the board and then go through.

10:33.434 --> 10:39.343
We had the section where you chose the, it wasn't really the sweetheart, but they call it

10:39.323 --> 10:44.511
Vanity Fair, I think is what they called it, and had to do that section.

10:44.551 --> 10:50.019
And these, all these different sections just had to be, had to be put together, then you had to do the write-ups on those.

10:50.039 --> 10:52.724
Who selected the Vanity Fair winner that year?

10:54.226 --> 10:54.947
I think I did.

10:55.007 --> 10:57.591
Y'all didn't call on some Hollywood?

10:57.611 --> 11:05.483
Well, no, that had been done in the past, and I just thought that was kind of hokey, so we just kind of got a little committee together and did it ourselves.

11:06.239 --> 11:12.508
Did they all, the seniors send their mother, I mean their sweetheart's picture, or did some send their mother?

11:12.628 --> 11:16.954
Well, in the favorites, some of them sent their mother.

11:17.875 --> 11:26.087
Well, I really didn't want to do that, but, you know, I didn't want to destroy A&M by telling them they couldn't do it.

11:27.046 --> 11:42.810
So most people sent in a girlfriend and then some, you know, sent in the larger pictures to try to get their girlfriend or in some cases their wife nominated for the

11:42.790 --> 11:43.791
whatever it was.

11:44.372 --> 11:49.700
You were, you all, as a working place, where, where were the offices for?

11:49.800 --> 11:51.383
It was in the second floor of Goodwin Hall.

11:51.583 --> 11:52.144
Of Goodwin.

11:52.344 --> 11:55.749
Who was the advisor, the professional?

11:56.070 --> 11:58.693
Well, it was the guy I was telling you about.

11:58.854 --> 12:00.616
Bing, Bing, Roland Bing.

12:00.756 --> 12:02.159
That's who it was, Roland Bing.

12:02.199 --> 12:03.861
He was, he was the main.

12:03.881 --> 12:06.305
And you reported, where'd, where'd you get your budget?

12:06.325 --> 12:07.046
How was it funded?

12:09.129 --> 12:10.671
Student activity fee money?

12:11.377 --> 12:14.800
Well, you know, we raised a lot of money by selling advertisement.

12:14.861 --> 12:19.365
I had an advertising manager who went out and sold advertising.

12:19.425 --> 12:22.669
We got the money there, and I don't know really what kind of budget we had.

12:22.689 --> 12:23.670
I can't remember.

12:24.530 --> 12:28.214
And did pretty well everybody have their picture taken and everybody participated?

12:28.234 --> 12:29.175
It was pretty good, yeah.

12:29.195 --> 12:35.762
But you know now, I was a class agent for a while, and every once in a while I'd start looking someone up and their picture wouldn't be in the annual.

12:35.842 --> 12:38.785
I thought, well this is really bad.

12:38.984 --> 12:44.274
You know after all these years somebody starts looking for a guy's picture and he didn't take the trouble to go get it made.

12:44.675 --> 12:46.138
What was your deadline?

12:46.258 --> 12:48.081
By what time of the year did you turn everything?

12:48.422 --> 12:57.499
Well we were turning it in all year long but I know that after I graduated I came back down here for a couple of weeks to finish up.

12:57.698 --> 12:58.820
finish up the Aggieland.

12:58.860 --> 13:02.869
And about when were they ready, when did, were they distributed?

13:03.490 --> 13:05.975
It was in the spring, in the fall semester sometimes.

13:05.996 --> 13:06.356
Okay.

13:06.917 --> 13:11.126
And how did, how did you, if you had already graduated, how did you pick it?

13:11.427 --> 13:13.010
I think they mailed them, they mailed them.

13:13.030 --> 13:13.431
Really?

13:13.471 --> 13:14.133
I think.

13:14.153 --> 13:16.197
That would have been a big mail then.

13:16.615 --> 13:19.058
Well a post-it didn't cost much.

13:19.078 --> 13:20.279
He sent a letter for three cents.

13:20.680 --> 13:26.127
Did you all have any kind of a theme or a format?

13:26.948 --> 13:27.428
Not really.

13:29.731 --> 13:37.020
Who was your, did you have somebody that you turned to for advice, some student that had been involved previous years?

13:37.000 --> 13:38.924
Not when I was the editor.

13:39.445 --> 13:40.868
I didn't want anybody around.

13:40.928 --> 13:47.482
You didn't have, did you have somebody that you admired some yearbook in the past you were trying to copy?

13:47.563 --> 13:49.387
Well, they weren't, they were all gone.

13:50.288 --> 13:51.010
But I had a bunch of

13:51.412 --> 13:53.555
you know, pretty good guys working for me.

13:53.615 --> 13:55.138
We'd get together and talk things over.

13:55.198 --> 13:57.942
Who were your closest associates?

13:57.962 --> 14:02.189
Well, Bob Skidmore was one of my good friends, and Bob Gregg that I mentioned.

14:02.529 --> 14:04.232
We used to go drinking beer together.

14:04.292 --> 14:07.818
Those were two of them that worked with me.

14:07.918 --> 14:12.525
And then, of course, Chuck Cavanaugh, but he was primarily the

14:13.298 --> 14:14.880
And you had a sports guy.

14:15.541 --> 14:17.263
And you had started as a sophomore?

14:17.443 --> 14:18.905
Yeah, I started working as a sophomore.

14:18.985 --> 14:21.488
Then as a junior, what was your task?

14:21.728 --> 14:25.753
Same thing, just whatever needed to be done, I worked on it.

14:25.773 --> 14:27.114
And then as a senior?

14:27.194 --> 14:28.716
You had to run for this job.

14:28.736 --> 14:31.219
It was elected by the student body.

14:31.780 --> 14:33.141
And do you remember what the vote was?

14:33.722 --> 14:34.183
I don't remember.

14:34.203 --> 14:43.153
I know Floyd Hinks ran against me, and he wound up as the advertising manager.

14:43.133 --> 14:44.295
So it ended friendly.

14:44.576 --> 14:47.381
Oh yeah.

14:49.565 --> 14:55.015
So did you have to come back for your senior year early in order to work on that?

14:55.316 --> 14:56.758
No.

14:56.859 --> 15:02.509
So describe a typical day then as a senior.

15:02.489 --> 15:20.336
describe a typical day for you as a company commander, an RV, and editor of the... Well, of course, I had the company, you know, and we did all the, you know, going to formation and all that sort of thing, and we had activities, intramurals, or we had drills.

15:20.837 --> 15:30.792
At that time, we had drill one afternoon a week, two hours an afternoon a week, had to be there, and so I did that, then

15:31.902 --> 15:37.651
Every afternoon, unless I had drill, I didn't have any labs at that time.

15:37.751 --> 15:45.703
Every afternoon I was there in Goodwin Hall overseeing the people working and doing a lot of the work myself.

15:45.863 --> 15:46.644
What about at night?

15:47.526 --> 15:48.327
We didn't work at night.

15:51.111 --> 15:56.239
By that time I was inactive in the RV so I didn't have to go to the RV drill.

15:56.590 --> 16:05.858
When you look back on that experience with the Aggieland of what are you most proud

16:06.682 --> 16:08.745
Boy, I'm proud of that book.

16:08.985 --> 16:10.807
What part of it or what?

16:10.827 --> 16:11.468
The whole thing.

16:11.828 --> 16:14.131
I thought it was a good annual.

16:14.552 --> 16:22.061
Did any, I presume nobody tried to play some joke to misplace something or nobody got something in there that shouldn't have been in?

16:22.181 --> 16:24.244
No, no, that's high school stuff.

16:24.264 --> 16:26.907
Or maybe some of these other rinky-dink schools.

16:27.027 --> 16:29.230
I don't think anybody would want to do that with the Aggieland.

16:29.581 --> 16:36.358
And did you, was there any kind of ceremony where you presented a copy to the president or anything like that?

16:36.378 --> 16:36.799
No, no, no.

16:36.819 --> 16:38.323
People wanted to buy it just like I did.

16:38.643 --> 16:39.485
Was there a theme?

16:39.546 --> 16:43.776
Not really.

16:43.958 --> 16:47.423
Have you ever looked at the one that Mike Halbuty edited in 1931?

16:47.443 --> 16:49.487
No, I don't think I have.

16:49.507 --> 16:51.350
All right, someday go to the archives.

16:51.650 --> 16:55.116
Well, if it's 31, I'm sure I did, because that's when my uncle was.

16:55.136 --> 16:55.777
I think it's 31.

16:55.877 --> 17:00.384
And he was the editor, and there's all kinds of nouveau art in it.

17:01.426 --> 17:05.372
Then did you ever meet Buck Shewitz?

17:06.534 --> 17:06.894
Never did.

17:06.914 --> 17:09.358
All right, Buck, class of 21.

17:09.608 --> 17:13.712
which is Mr. Evans and Mr. Zachary.

17:14.373 --> 17:17.876
Buck was from Queiro and he ends up being a professional artist.

17:18.417 --> 17:23.542
He was the art editor that year and there's some splendid art in there.

17:23.562 --> 17:25.244
I have a copy of that one I'm proud to say.

17:29.167 --> 17:34.713
When did you decide that you were going to be serious about the military as a career?

17:36.234 --> 17:37.776
I went to summer camp

17:38.836 --> 17:42.850
In 19, end of my junior year.

17:43.331 --> 17:44.335
End of your junior year?

17:44.355 --> 17:45.037
Yeah, end of my junior year.

17:45.057 --> 17:47.485
I went to summer camp and I just, I really liked it.

17:47.565 --> 17:48.910
Well I'd always liked the military.

17:49.311 --> 17:51.900
I thought over the years I might want to be a soldier.

17:52.150 --> 17:56.274
And of course during World War II I wanted to be a Marine, but then I wised up a little bit.

17:58.095 --> 18:02.819
But summer camp, you know, out firing all the weapons and doing all that stuff, and I really kind of liked it.

18:02.839 --> 18:04.281
I thought maybe that's what I want to do.

18:04.321 --> 18:06.242
Where'd you do camp, summer camp?

18:06.583 --> 18:07.103
Camp Hood.

18:07.643 --> 18:13.328
One thing I missed, at the end of my sophomore year I had a very unique experience.

18:14.369 --> 18:20.875
The United Fruit Company had an internship in Central America.

18:21.547 --> 18:30.055
And so I signed up for that and I went down to Central America in Panama on the Atlantic side near a little place called Puerto Moyes.

18:30.735 --> 18:34.459
And I was an assistant farm overseer for the summer on a banana farm.

18:35.319 --> 18:37.802
And it was, the banana farm was way out in the boonies.

18:37.862 --> 18:39.583
In fact, there were no roads out there.

18:39.603 --> 18:42.326
The only way to get there was a little narrow gauge railroad.

18:42.946 --> 18:47.711
And if you wanted to go somewhere, you had to call out a car and they'd send a little sidecar out and pick you up.

18:48.712 --> 18:51.334
And so I spent the summer riding around on the mule

18:51.803 --> 18:56.251
overseeing the banana farm, banana plantations.

18:56.271 --> 18:58.955
What did you learn from that summer?

18:58.975 --> 19:00.458
Well, I don't know.

19:00.478 --> 19:01.159
I learned a whole lot.

19:01.179 --> 19:02.381
I had a lot of fun, you know.

19:02.401 --> 19:03.964
I learned how to grow bananas.

19:04.064 --> 19:04.404
I knew that.

19:04.645 --> 19:06.388
Well, you must have learned how to work with some.

19:06.768 --> 19:16.545
Well, we had mostly, well, we had Indians that did the spraying and the grass cutting, and then we had Panamanians that did some of the work.

19:17.015 --> 19:19.138
And I'm assuming your Spanish was limited.

19:19.439 --> 19:21.782
Very limited, yeah.

19:21.802 --> 19:21.983
Yeah, so.

19:22.003 --> 19:24.687
But you must have learned something about how to work with people.

19:25.087 --> 19:29.354
Well, yeah, I think I learned that in the Corps a long time ago, you know.

19:29.374 --> 19:31.377
Oh, that, because that would, that'd be very.

19:31.397 --> 19:32.579
It was a unique experience.

19:32.599 --> 19:45.098
You know, got to go down on a, went to New Orleans and then went from there on a, well, they had these banana boats that had 99 passengers and carried bananas and, you know, the Great White Fleet, they called it, United Fruit Company, you know, went down.

19:45.601 --> 19:52.337
Then caught another ship through the Panama Canal, on and on up the coast to Puerto Moyes.

19:52.520 --> 19:54.162
You know, it was really interesting.

19:54.182 --> 20:05.574
And while I was there, I took one weekend off and went up into the high mountains there, to a small, and it was really primitive, you know, 1947, I guess this was.

20:07.776 --> 20:09.578
So it was, it was a unique experience.

20:10.199 --> 20:11.100
Now that's after your?

20:11.600 --> 20:12.682
That's after my sophomore year.

20:12.702 --> 20:12.902
Sophomore.

20:12.942 --> 20:19.929
Then my junior year, after my junior year is when I went to ROTC summer camp, and that's where I met my wife while I was there.

20:20.270 --> 20:21.531
She was from Belton.

20:22.186 --> 20:31.504
a fellow in my outfit named Randy Holland, James Randolph Holland, and so I went into Belton, which is about

20:32.092 --> 20:34.856
20 miles away to him one Saturday afternoon.

20:34.896 --> 20:40.043
We went down to the swimming pool and we met all these Belton girls down there that he knew all of them, you know.

20:40.083 --> 20:41.244
He'd gone to high school with them.

20:41.264 --> 20:52.339
And so wound up meeting my wife and she reluctantly agreed to go on a date that night because she said she just didn't, she didn't go on blind dates.

20:52.400 --> 20:56.285
And we said, you know, I'm not blind, you know.

20:56.305 --> 20:57.787
I overwhelmed her I guess.

20:57.887 --> 21:01.592
Now what year in school was she?

21:01.775 --> 21:05.025
That was the end of her freshman year at Baylor.

21:05.988 --> 21:07.893
It was the end of my junior year at A&M.

21:08.555 --> 21:11.464
So anyway we met there and then dated and then

21:11.782 --> 21:14.125
My senior year, I was running back and forth to Waco.

21:14.586 --> 21:16.829
And you still had that, do you have that same car?

21:17.911 --> 21:18.592
I didn't have a car.

21:18.912 --> 21:19.914
Oh, oh, you didn't have a car yet.

21:19.954 --> 21:20.354
No, no.

21:20.374 --> 21:21.256
Oh, that, oh, no.

21:21.276 --> 21:23.980
No, a friend of mine had an old Model A. We'd go to Waco on Wednesday night.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.203
Your grandmother promised you one if you'd go home.

21:26.243 --> 21:26.563
She promised me.

21:26.603 --> 21:32.592
If I'd gone to A&M, I mean, Abilene Christian College, I'd have been probably a preacher driving around in a car.

21:32.572 --> 21:36.880
But so how did you get back and forth to Waco?

21:37.220 --> 21:41.287
This buddy of mine had a girlfriend up there and he had a Model A. Oh and you rode with him?

21:41.327 --> 21:44.132
And I rode with him back and forth to Waco.

21:44.152 --> 21:47.518
And when, do you remember when you brought her to the campus for the first time?

21:48.660 --> 21:50.023
Oh it was some time that year.

21:50.063 --> 21:56.554
It was one of the, I don't think it was the football game, it was probably in the, well

21:57.850 --> 21:59.574
probably in the spring at one of the dances.

21:59.654 --> 22:03.583
I know she's never forgiven me for not inviting her down to the cotton ball.

22:04.044 --> 22:05.527
But I never did go to the cotton ball.

22:05.547 --> 22:08.814
I didn't want to go to the cotton ball.

22:08.834 --> 22:11.019
But she's never let me forget that.

22:11.600 --> 22:15.148
But she did come down like it was probably the infantry ball or something like that.

22:15.168 --> 22:16.551
Did she come to commencement?

22:17.813 --> 22:19.395
I don't think so.

22:20.276 --> 22:23.881
And you know one time she came down and she stayed at Benny Zen's house.

22:23.921 --> 22:29.588
You probably remember, see, Benny's, young Benny Zen was a freshman with me and a good friend of mine.

22:30.389 --> 22:32.612
And in fact they were from Temple.

22:33.733 --> 22:36.236
And so she stayed at Benny Zen's house.

22:36.256 --> 22:40.902
That might have been the only time she was down here because I can't remember her staying anywhere else because

22:41.455 --> 22:43.617
I mean, her mother wasn't going to let her go anywhere.

22:43.957 --> 22:51.305
I mean, she wasn't about to let her come down here and stay in a motel or a hotel or anything like that, but since she was staying, and they knew the Zins, so.

22:51.465 --> 22:54.768
And I presume she caught a ride down here, or did she come on the bus or train?

22:55.669 --> 22:56.770
I don't know.

22:56.790 --> 22:57.651
I don't know how she came.

22:57.971 --> 22:58.792
That's a good question.

22:59.673 --> 23:06.760
The, and so by that beginning of that senior year, you're serious about the military as a career?

23:07.481 --> 23:07.581
Yeah.

23:08.219 --> 23:12.586
And describe what it was like to be a company commander.

23:12.646 --> 23:15.250
Tell me as much as you can about being a company commander.

23:15.670 --> 23:30.092
Well, it was, you know, you're the head guy and it was, it was a great, great experience and you just had to keep all the sophomores and didn't have any freshmen, you see, sophomores and juniors in line and then try to get along with your

23:30.427 --> 23:34.891
with your contemporaries because a lot of it is things are done by consensus, you know.

23:34.911 --> 23:56.012
Well I never was really much of a consensus guy because I've always, if I'm the leader, I'll make the decision and I'll get input from people and I'll get advice from people and I'll ask them for advice even though I probably know what I'm going to do anyway, but you know, some people feel pretty good if you ask, you ask them for advice if you kind of know what they're going to tell you, see.

23:56.667 --> 23:59.251
So that's kind of the way I ran the company.

23:59.291 --> 24:06.080
And I had some of the seniors that, you know, just weren't interested in doing anything and couldn't get them to participate in anything.

24:06.120 --> 24:09.925
And I had others that were, you know, really gung-ho good guys and everything.

24:10.466 --> 24:14.952
Now, to be selected as a company commander in those days, were you interviewed?

24:15.152 --> 24:18.177
Was there a review committee that involved interviews?

24:18.437 --> 24:20.660
I'm not sure how you got selected.

24:20.700 --> 24:22.202
I know, see, I was the

24:22.182 --> 24:27.089
I was the guide-owned bearer when I was in C Company sophomore year.

24:27.709 --> 24:41.608
And I think that was a range because they had so many people that came out of companies that had been deactivated, put in these companies that were still in force and it just didn't appear fair for those people to get all the good jobs.

24:42.069 --> 24:45.293
You know, like company commander, first sergeant, guide-owned bearer, things like that.

24:45.714 --> 24:48.898
So I think there was probably some kind of arrangement

24:48.878 --> 24:57.494
that I came from D Company, therefore I would be the guide-on-bearer because I had been selected guide-on-bearer at the end of my freshman year.

24:58.276 --> 25:01.502
And that was the prestigious job in the company.

25:02.243 --> 25:08.495
And so then when they reactivated the company, well, I wound up as the first sergeant.

25:09.136 --> 25:12.102
And if you're the first sergeant and you do your job, then

25:13.178 --> 25:15.466
chances are you will become the company commander.

25:15.626 --> 25:20.262
So I guess really the key is to getting selected as the guy don't bear a sophomore.

25:20.282 --> 25:23.192
But anyway, I carried that through and wound up the company commander.

25:23.874 --> 25:25.399
And it wasn't, you know, it wasn't

25:25.750 --> 25:29.895
all that demanding because, you know, people were going to class and everything.

25:29.915 --> 25:37.783
You just had to make sure that, you had to keep on them by keeping the rooms cleaned up because you'd get demerits and so forth if you didn't and you wanted to look good, you know.

25:38.564 --> 25:50.157
And then, of course, you were always graded at march-ins and drills and things like that and you tried to motivate them to do their best and it was mostly motivational was what it was.

25:50.798 --> 25:55.723
And how often were all company commanders called together for any purpose?

25:56.868 --> 25:59.895
Probably every other week maybe we'd have meetings.

26:01.017 --> 26:01.659
It's hard to get.

26:01.939 --> 26:03.603
Did Boatner lecture to you guys?

26:04.545 --> 26:14.387
You know I don't remember ever being in just a commander's meeting with Boatner other than I remember one over and over in

26:16.510 --> 26:19.635
the old assembly hall.

26:20.115 --> 26:24.622
The old assembly hall was over there across the street from where the quack shack is now.

26:24.642 --> 26:26.806
I guess it's right in there where that chapel is.

26:27.727 --> 26:29.850
I remember Boatner talking to us over there one time.

26:31.513 --> 26:37.742
But usually, as far as I know, the company commander's meeting were called by the corps staff.

26:38.060 --> 26:40.663
or by the, by the TAC officers.

26:40.884 --> 26:42.446
And we had TAC officers at that time.

26:42.486 --> 26:47.993
We had military officers who gave us, you know, conducted the military science classes.

26:48.013 --> 26:51.858
Then we had TAC officers that, that stayed over in the Durham area.

26:52.399 --> 26:55.924
And they were reserve officers that were not on active duty.

26:55.944 --> 26:57.145
They were university employees.

26:57.586 --> 27:03.073
Is there, was there anyone to whom you would have turned for advice?

27:04.034 --> 27:05.256
I've got this kind of situation.

27:05.296 --> 27:05.957
What do I do?

27:07.675 --> 27:12.625
Well, probably my military science instructors because I thought a lot of them.

27:12.665 --> 27:14.329
They were really super, super people.

27:14.349 --> 27:14.930
Who were some of them?

27:14.950 --> 27:18.457
Well, there was Colonel Lewis was the chief infantry instructor.

27:18.778 --> 27:20.621
And at that time we had branch ROTC.

27:21.062 --> 27:23.828
See, I took infantry ROTC.

27:23.808 --> 27:32.043
And there was another, there was a captain, I can't, it starts with a K, I can't remember his name, but he was really, really good.

27:32.063 --> 27:36.491
And there were just some super, super officers over there that you could talk to.

27:36.571 --> 27:41.800
And a few of the TAC officers, you know, we didn't think much of the TAC officers normally.

27:42.961 --> 27:51.587
And you put on that new rank insignia at final review your junior year.

27:51.607 --> 27:52.129
Is that right?

27:52.670 --> 27:52.771
Yeah.

27:52.791 --> 27:54.436
How did you feel when you put on it?

27:54.456 --> 27:55.840
Oh great.

27:56.393 --> 28:00.457
Back to, see I'd been a captain in high school and now I'm back to captain again.

28:00.497 --> 28:03.481
Of course at that time the captains were the, were the company commanders.

28:03.781 --> 28:05.923
Where did you get your senior boots?

28:05.943 --> 28:15.193
I bought my senior boots, I think I paid $40 or $45, something like that for them from a fellow named Curry who was from Sreveport, Louisiana.

28:15.213 --> 28:19.358
And at that time people didn't keep their boots, they just, you just passed them on to the next guy.

28:19.678 --> 28:21.480
It might have been $50, I'm not sure.

28:21.620 --> 28:24.443
But I turned around and sold them to somebody for about the same price.

28:24.423 --> 28:28.927
I paid for them because, you know, I didn't need those boots or want those boots.

28:28.947 --> 28:33.712
Did any family, special family come at Final Review your junior year?

28:36.274 --> 28:37.996
I don't think so my junior year.

28:38.416 --> 28:47.164
I know my, I think my grandmother and my aunt and my mother came my, when I graduated in Final Review that year.

28:48.045 --> 28:49.847
But you know, it was a long, see roads were pretty bad.

28:49.907 --> 28:52.489
It was, this was a long haul down here from Fort Worth.

28:52.908 --> 28:55.452
And people didn't have much money.

28:58.856 --> 29:08.070
One of my normal questions is where were you when you heard the news that something had occurred, but during your years there was no Pearl Harbor or Vietnam.

29:08.350 --> 29:14.339
It started the summer after you got out, so there weren't, and there was no presidential assassination.

29:14.359 --> 29:16.562
Oh, you mean while I was in, while I was in university?

29:17.183 --> 29:18.865
I can't think of anything.

29:18.845 --> 29:22.872
I can't think of anything during that period.

29:24.634 --> 29:29.402
The, were you aware when you were an undergraduate that there were any secret fraternities?

29:30.765 --> 29:37.936
I didn't hear about the TTs until I was out of school for a year and then that's when they, it came out down here.

29:38.277 --> 29:40.040
Did you ever hear of the stickers?

29:40.621 --> 29:41.562
Never heard of the stickers.

29:42.784 --> 29:43.305
You haven't yet?

29:43.746 --> 29:45.088
Never heard of the stickers.

29:45.777 --> 29:53.560
Well I heard of the TTs and I know one guy that, in fact, Howard Perry told me this guy was involved.

29:54.248 --> 29:57.353
And I asked him about it one time, and he was very evasive about it.

29:57.393 --> 29:58.655
He didn't want to even talk about it.

29:58.695 --> 30:00.779
But while you were a student, you were mad.

30:00.859 --> 30:03.143
I had never heard of a secret organization.

30:04.946 --> 30:10.876
And it kind of made me mad when I found out they had one, and they didn't tell me.

30:11.236 --> 30:17.607
It was just like the CIA was really recruiting heavily in 1949 and 1950.

30:18.008 --> 30:19.032
on college campuses.

30:19.674 --> 30:24.270
And in fact, Jarvis Miller told me who the CIA recruiter was.

30:24.351 --> 30:25.735
It was, in fact, he was in our dorm.

30:26.639 --> 30:27.883
And I know

30:28.387 --> 30:32.611
I'm almost possibly that three of the people in my outfit went in the CIA.

30:32.831 --> 30:34.473
One of them I know was in the CIA.

30:34.493 --> 30:41.780
I mean he was seen in Chiang Mai, Thailand back in the 60s, running an import-export business.

30:41.800 --> 30:43.041
And he was seen in other places.

30:43.061 --> 30:45.383
In fact he died here about a year ago.

30:45.403 --> 30:51.188
Another guy was the second secretary in Afghanistan or something like that.

30:51.509 --> 30:56.653
And he, his address is always unknown in the directory.

30:56.674 --> 30:58.275
And the other guy, I read in

30:58.863 --> 31:05.190
I was reading a book and they mentioned his name as being in Laos with the CIA.

31:05.210 --> 31:10.616
So there were three guys out of my outfit and I always, they always made me mad that they, no one ever approached me.

31:10.636 --> 31:17.664
But then I realized that the guys that went into the CIA were the real quiet ones that were always in the background.

31:17.724 --> 31:21.689
And they didn't want a loud mouthed guy like me, you know, who was out there in front all the time.

31:23.190 --> 31:25.613
They didn't want me in the CIA.

31:26.133 --> 31:34.101
During that time, what were the student
