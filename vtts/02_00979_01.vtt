00:02.528 --> 00:09.777
This is an interview with Roberto Garcia by 
Leticia Garcia on April 23rd in Palestine, Texas

00:02.528 --> 00:09.777
concerning the Vietnam War. In the interest of 
accumulating knowledge about the war, I am going

00:10.918 --> 00:19.068
to donate this tape to the Texas A&M Oral History 
Collection in the University Archives. Is that

00:19.088 --> 00:20.910
all right with you? Yes, that's all right with me. 
I'd like to start off by getting a brief background

00:23.033 --> 00:31.523
of your military career, such as why and when you 
joined, to give us an understanding of your

00:23.033 --> 00:31.523
experiences before Vietnam. To better 
understand where I came from, you might say I was

00:32.802 --> 00:44.755
raised in a large family in a farming community. My 
father was a small farmer, my mother a housewife. I

00:53.324 --> 00:55.446
have a high school education. I graduated in May of 
1955. After graduating, I worked for four years,

01:03.413 --> 01:14.147
after four years of working in a company where I was 
a stock boy, I decided that life was a little

01:03.413 --> 01:14.147
unexciting. I thought that I wanted to do better 
things. I decided that the military was about the

01:17.812 --> 01:24.061
best way that I could do it. So in December of 1958, I 
joined the military service. I took basic

01:33.569 --> 01:44.539
training, advanced individual training, and 
was, subsequent to that, assigned to a signal

01:33.569 --> 01:44.539
company in Fairbanks, Alaska for two years. After 
completing my overseas tour in Alaska, I came

01:45.780 --> 01:51.325
back. I served approximately a year in Fort 
Benning, Georgia, again as a communicator. I was

01:59.572 --> 02:02.395
separated from the service in March of 1962.

02:07.492 --> 02:16.062
I stayed out for approximately three months after 
having been a civilian again for approximately

02:07.492 --> 02:16.062
three months. I decided that life in the military 
was not all that bad and I rejoined the military.

02:23.631 --> 02:31.960
Can you tell me when you were sent to Vietnam why you 
went and your initial reactions to going? I went to

02:32.446 --> 02:33.507
Vietnam. I had rejoined the military service. I 
was stationed with a tactical communications

02:37.473 --> 02:43.622
company in Fort Riley, Kansas. I had been in the 
Army, back in the Army, approximately four

02:43.722 --> 02:49.930
months. One day I was called to the company and I was 
informed that I had orders for Germany. I was happy

02:57.581 --> 03:01.086
about the assignment because I had not been to 
Germany. And I lived with that for approximately

03:05.316 --> 03:08.821
one week. In about a week they called me back into 
the company and told me that my orders for Germany

03:08.841 --> 03:22.357
had been cancelled and that I was being sent to 
Vietnam. Vietnam at that time was a very small

03:23.518 --> 03:31.528
insurgency guerrilla warfare type of a thing 
going on. I was elated. I looked upon it as an

03:34.237 --> 03:45.454
adventure, something that very few people were 
doing at that time, going to Vietnam, and I was

03:34.237 --> 03:45.454
really looking forward to it. Did your initial 
thoughts change after you had been there, say,

03:45.474 --> 03:50.201
like a couple months or so? Well, yes, in a way. I 
went to Vietnam, and it didn't take me long to find

03:52.885 --> 03:59.575
out that it was not really an exciting thing. It was 
new, everything that we did from day to day, or the

04:00.044 --> 04:09.353
experiences that we went through, I guess you 
might say, were still new. However, after, say,

04:10.114 --> 04:18.062
three or four months, we more or less, or I more or 
less, settled upon a routine. And I found it

04:18.983 --> 04:22.026
somewhat boring. The thoughts that I had about 
Vietnam was that it was going to be an exciting

04:23.187 --> 04:29.393
place, something Exciting happened every day and 
I found much too much. Much to my dismay that this

04:34.395 --> 04:38.360
would not be a case. Can you tell me like the 
conditions of the country at the time that you

04:38.560 --> 04:42.624
want? What were they like? Well, the conditions 
over there.

04:49.752 --> 04:53.676
Even though they were somewhat different than 
what I would have expected to find.

04:56.419 --> 04:57.000
Were that it is a very poor country, that people 
live very poorly.

05:06.870 --> 05:18.429
Their facilities

05:06.870 --> 05:18.429
are not anywhere near what they are here in the 
United States. Transportation at that time, and I

05:18.449 --> 05:24.439
imagine that it's still the same, was almost 
nonexistent. As far as modern transportation,

05:24.993 --> 05:33.946
the people still depended upon bicycles as their 
main means of transportation. The people live in

05:34.466 --> 05:40.094
very poor houses. Their income is almost nothing 
in comparison to ours. They do not have the

05:47.765 --> 05:49.768
furniture or the appliances that we accept as an 
everyday common thing here in the United States.

05:58.719 --> 06:04.407
What was your unit's mission in support of the war, 
and how did you fit in as far as your duties went? The

06:05.649 --> 06:18.507
unit that I was assigned to was the 232nd Signal 
Company, parentheses,

06:05.649 --> 06:18.507
Combat Support, close the parentheses. We were 
responsible for establishing communications,

06:19.330 --> 06:42.174
and by communications I mean teletype and 
communication center and telephone

06:19.330 --> 06:42.174
communications from major headquarters to major 
headquarters and down to a certain extent to

06:19.330 --> 06:42.174
subordinate level.

06:45.277 --> 06:49.101
Initially, I served on a communication site for 
approximately two months as a non-commissioned

06:50.397 --> 07:01.474
officer in charge of a shift between 11 o'clock at 
night and 7 o'clock in the morning. After

07:02.676 --> 07:11.048
approximately three months, I was presented with 
the opportunity to serve as a unit operations

07:02.676 --> 07:11.048
sergeant. I accepted that job flatly. It was a very 
challenging job. We were responsible for

07:19.216 --> 07:32.812
administering or supervising the overall 
mission

07:19.216 --> 07:32.812
type functions of the unit. We had approximately 
11 sites that we provided the support to maintain

07:32.832 --> 07:46.408
the communications and also the planning

07:49.865 --> 07:52.729
I'm sure you didn't work 24 hours a day all the time. 
Can you tell me a little bit about what the American

07:53.170 --> 07:58.218
soldiers did for relaxation? Yes, just like any 
other place, depending upon the individual, we

07:58.298 --> 08:13.421
all did different things, even though most of us 
had some other things in common more than others.

08:14.723 --> 08:17.627
The average soldier would, once he got off of work, 
Relax for a small while. Then there were several

08:21.616 --> 08:26.101
activities sponsored by the military. We had the 
equipment to become engaged in sports

08:26.121 --> 08:33.811
activities, if you so desired. There were 
libraries that the soldier could go to and pick up a

08:35.112 --> 08:46.146
book and maybe relax for a few minutes or a few 
hours. They were not elaborate libraries. They

08:49.035 --> 08:54.005
were somewhat limited in the number of books 
available. However, the libraries were there.

08:55.949 --> 09:04.988
There were the movies which, even though somewhat 
limited, were available. The unit would petty

09:07.000 --> 09:11.887
circuit wherein certain movies were shown 
throughout the Republic of Vietnam. During the

09:12.808 --> 09:19.638
course of a week, they would be rotated from one 
place to another, and some people engaged in

09:12.808 --> 09:19.638
watching movies. We, I think the majority of us, 
became involved in two things. One was playing

09:30.033 --> 09:31.395
cards. We would begin playing cards.

09:36.903 --> 09:53.390
Sometime during the course of the evening, 
normally not too long after supper, we would play

09:36.903 --> 09:53.390
either poker, either for money or just for what we 
termed penny ante, or we would just play for the fun

09:36.903 --> 09:53.390
of it. And of course, just like the reputation that 
had been given to the military, a lot of us got

10:03.700 --> 10:14.891
involved in drinking and sitting and talking for 
hours upon hours as a means to pass the time away.

10:14.911 --> 10:17.714
There was also a lot of time spent in writing 
letters. At that time, we didn't have the

10:18.595 --> 10:33.370
cassettes that are available nowadays, so the 
average soldier would correspond with his

10:18.595 --> 10:33.370
family's friends back in the States, also for long 
periods of time. There were other things. One of

10:37.511 --> 10:51.929
the things that I did on the average once a week, 
maybe twice a week, we would go into downtown

10:37.511 --> 10:51.929
Saigon, which was only approximately 10 miles 
from where I was stationed. That is my experience

10:51.949 --> 11:01.500
with the average things a person would do for his 
off-duty activities. Was there a big involvement

11:02.510 --> 11:06.294
with drugs and alcohol? Initially, on my first 
tour, you've got to understand that this was back

11:07.836 --> 11:16.747
in the early 1960s, 1962, matter of fact.

11:19.450 --> 11:21.392
Drugs were almost nonexistent. When you talk 
about drugs, you were talking about a person that

11:21.412 --> 11:28.160
was not ordinary. He was out of the ordinary. if a 
person were using drugs who was not accepted as

11:30.067 --> 11:38.056
being a person that you wanted to get involved 
with. So no drugs in the sense that we use drugs in

11:38.336 --> 11:48.327
were nonexistent at the time. The alcohol was 
there, yes, the alcohol was there. Okay. Can you

11:53.673 --> 11:56.477
tell me why the U.S. became involved in the war? Or 
why you feel they became involved in the war? Our

12:00.070 --> 12:12.926
involvement in the war stems from an agreement, 
the Southeastern Asia Treaty Organization, in

12:00.070 --> 12:12.926
which we were a partner. That agreement came into 
existence, best of my knowledge, just like the

12:13.306 --> 12:21.657
North Atlantic Treaty Organization, NATO. 
Immediately after World War II,

12:32.487 --> 13:01.903
people, the parties, the politicians in 
existence at that time must have determined

12:32.487 --> 13:01.903
that it would be wise to come up with

12:32.487 --> 13:01.903
such organizations and to come up with such 
agreements and basically what they stated was

12:32.487 --> 13:01.903
that if I get attacked I'm going to ask for your 
assistance or if I get a threat to my

13:02.339 --> 13:10.008
party's power. Somebody is trying to usurp that 
existing government.

13:20.580 --> 13:31.452
I, if necessary, I'm going to ask for assistance 
and all nations that are co-signers of that treaty

13:20.580 --> 13:31.452
are more or less required to come to my assistance. 
We were a co-signee of that treaty, so were the

13:36.582 --> 13:51.504
Australians, so were the Philippines, so were

13:36.582 --> 13:51.504
the Vietnamese. We had different nations 
involved in that treaty. The president of Vietnam

13:57.152 --> 14:01.759
at that time was new non-Nadim, if I remember 
correctly, he evidently found it advisable to ask

14:03.292 --> 14:14.649
for our assistance. Initially, we started by only 
sending military advisors. Matter of fact, I went

14:19.276 --> 14:31.054
as a military advisor the first time that we went 
over, which meant that we were there as a guest of

14:19.276 --> 14:31.054
that nation, that we were not involved in any war 
activities other than advising the vietnamese

14:31.692 --> 15:00.265
when i went over the first time like i say in 1962 the 
advisory group was a very very small force we were

14:31.692 --> 15:00.265
down to about approximately uh 10 15 000 american 
soldiers this is army navy and air force combined

15:01.325 --> 15:06.330
So at the time in 1962, America's involvement in 
the war wasn't an active one? It was not an active

15:06.691 --> 15:28.935
one, even though some advisors, and I'm talking 
about the infantry type, the ranger type, they

15:06.691 --> 15:28.935
would

15:06.691 --> 15:28.935
go along with regular Vietnamese armies whenever 
they went out on search and destroy missions.

15:29.725 --> 15:49.748
Inadvertently, it was necessary that they fire in 
their defense, and I'd like to reiterate that at

15:29.725 --> 15:49.748
that time, an American soldier, even though he 
carried a weapon with ammunition, was instructed

15:29.725 --> 15:49.748
that he would only use that weapon as a means of 
self-defense. In answer to your question, yes, it

15:49.808 --> 15:55.395
was a very small part that we played at that time. 
How did the Vietnamese react to the war, such as the

15:56.371 --> 16:04.122
feelings towards Americans and their overall 
attitude?

16:09.429 --> 16:25.652
My experience or my interaction with Vietnamese 
on my first tour was very limited, and I can only

16:09.429 --> 16:25.652
speak from those limited encounters that I had 
with the Vietnamese. But the impression that I got

16:26.392 --> 16:55.538
was that initially the Vietnamese

16:26.392 --> 16:55.538
accepted us as somewhat super beings, that their 
propaganda machine had told them that we were

16:26.392 --> 16:55.538
extremely powerful, extremely kind, and 
extremely benevolent, that we were the, quote,

16:26.392 --> 16:55.538
good guys. I also got the impression that as time 
went along, the Vietnamese found out that we, to

16:56.142 --> 17:20.327
quote them, were same thing, that we were also 
human, that we were not necessarily the nice guy

16:56.142 --> 17:20.327
that we had been talked about to be. So to begin 
with, in 1962, they were pretty much supportive of

17:21.640 --> 17:26.226
Americans? Those that I talked to were very 
supportive of Americans. But like I said, as time

17:30.532 --> 17:41.707
went along, I got the impression that they were 
disenchanted with our actions. What about back

17:41.727 --> 17:45.031
home in the United States in 1962? Were the 
Americans supportive of the war? In 1962, yes, the

17:47.813 --> 17:52.501
Americans were supportive of the war. They, at 
that time, the military, that stigma to the

17:53.462 --> 18:03.438
military was popular to serve in the defense of the 
nation. The soldiers were still proud to wear the

18:03.478 --> 18:07.144
uniform. They were looked upon with respect. 
people would go out of their way to try to be helpful

18:10.122 --> 18:15.550
to them. And generally, yes, the general public 
had a favorable support for the Vietnam War. As the

18:26.787 --> 18:37.142
war progressed through the 60s, did you note any 
changes of what we just discussed, say like

18:26.787 --> 18:37.142
America's involvement in the war? Yes, there was a 
definite change in the general public's attitude

18:38.472 --> 18:48.505
of our involvement in the war. I do not think that 
the soldiers' way of thinking about the war

18:48.705 --> 18:56.055
changed. There was, in the United States at that 
time, a movement mainly at the college level to

19:04.308 --> 19:12.541
question and attack our involvement of the war. As 
this movement increased, and I might say that it

19:14.423 --> 19:30.568
was not only at the college level, there were 
certain groups, not necessarily communistic,

19:31.122 --> 19:45.795
were 100 percent opposed to our involvement in the 
war, and they very actively politicked and

19:31.122 --> 19:45.795
questioned our involvement in the war. As the 
movement became stronger, as the feelings became

19:47.337 --> 19:59.728
stronger, as the demonstrations became 
stronger, politicians for whatever their

20:00.400 --> 20:13.394
reasons either selfish or if they in actuality 
thought that our involvement was wrong,

20:00.400 --> 20:13.394
continuously attacked our policies. They 
questioned the President's authority. They

20:16.318 --> 20:22.344
questioned the amount of money that was being 
spent in the effort. They questioned the number of

20:22.364 --> 20:27.690
lives that were being lost in the war. They 
questioned the military's

20:28.075 --> 20:34.965
decisions. They questioned their authority to 
bomb another country. They questioned the

20:40.452 --> 20:45.940
authority to pursue the enemy beyond certain 
lines.

20:48.964 --> 20:57.897
All in all, I would venture to say from the middle 
60s, 1965,

21:00.070 --> 21:22.617
through the latter part of the 60s and 
particularly in the 70s until the end of the war,

21:00.070 --> 21:22.617
the attitude of the nation did a 100%

21:00.070 --> 21:22.617
turnabout. You mentioned a while ago that you 
served as an advisor the first time you went. Was

21:26.762 --> 21:29.706
that the same status you served as the second time 
around? No. Like I mentioned, when I went over on my

21:33.340 --> 21:39.870
first tour, we were a very small force at the time. 
We were not authorized to conduct aggressive

21:39.930 --> 21:47.422
activities. We could only fire a weapon as a matter 
of self-defense. If you will remember, or if you

21:53.953 --> 21:57.398
have read any history books, though, Sometime in 
1964, August 1964, if I remember correctly, the

21:58.120 --> 22:23.875
United States stated, even though it was 
questioned by various ways,

21:58.120 --> 22:23.875
that United States ships had been attacked by 
North Vietnamese

22:24.901 --> 22:28.144
patrol boats in the Gulf of Tonkin. We refer to it as 
the Gulf of Tonkin incident. Whatever the case may

22:34.750 --> 22:52.967
have been, the United States used that incident to 
further expand its war effort,

22:34.750 --> 22:52.967
whereas we had been maintaining a small number of 
military personnel in Vietnam. Even though it had

22:58.765 --> 23:08.175
progressed, in 1964 we had somewhere about 
100,000 military personnel in Vietnam. After the

23:08.655 --> 23:21.908
Gulf of Tonkin incident, not too long after that, 
within a year, the United States had increased its

23:22.478 --> 23:27.325
total military force to approximately 300,000, 
350,000. By virtue of that, and mind you, I am not

23:28.307 --> 23:48.857
familiar with international law, under what 
circumstances

23:28.307 --> 23:48.857
you will change from an advisor status to an active 
war maker, you might say. But during that course,

23:49.478 --> 24:10.283
anyhow, the United States dropped its advisory 
status in Vietnam and became actively involved,

23:49.478 --> 24:10.283
as you might want to term it, an aggressor force in 
Vietnam. Can you tell me about your second tour in

24:10.303 --> 24:14.107
Vietnam? Was it voluntary? Yes.

24:20.225 --> 24:23.788
At that time, I was serving in Fort Hood, Texas. The 
unit that I was in was alerted that they would be

24:24.889 --> 24:32.356
going to Vietnam. We went through approximately 
11 months of intensive preparation and training.

24:43.325 --> 24:48.510
Because of the regulations at that time, I was 
exempt from going to Vietnam unless I signed a

24:49.435 --> 25:02.692
waiver waiving my rights to that exemption 
because I had been back in Vietnam for less than 24

24:49.435 --> 25:02.692
months. However, at the time, I had been back in the 
United States 22 months and I thought that if I did

25:02.712 --> 25:17.451
not go with that unit, that i would eventually as 
soon as my 24 months were up would be going to

25:19.068 --> 25:47.320
vietnam anyhow i considered my option uh the pros 
and the cons i had people that were very

25:19.068 --> 25:47.320
professional in that company uh i was friends with 
them i knew how they operated I had trust and faith

25:48.616 --> 25:52.059
in them. I was serving in a position of authority.

25:59.906 --> 26:12.878
The promotions at that time, if you were serving in 
the position, particularly in Vietnam, you could

25:59.906 --> 26:12.878
almost be assured of a promotion. So I took all 
these things into consideration,

26:12.898 --> 26:17.762
figured These things that I have just talked about 
on the positive side, on the contrary side, I

26:18.215 --> 26:40.667
figured that if I did not go with a unit with people 
that I already knew and respected, that I would

26:18.215 --> 26:40.667
eventually be going separately, possibly with 
another unit, people that I was not familiar with.

26:40.687 --> 26:43.851
So consequently, yes, I signed a waiver and I did go 
to Vietnam. So is this the same unit you went with

26:44.978 --> 26:47.942
the first time? No, this was the 54th Signal 
Battalion. We also provided communications at

26:51.186 --> 26:59.137
core level down to division level. And though this 
might seem strange to you, the concept is there.

27:07.248 --> 27:09.070
It's a good concept. We're in the concept dictates 
the type of support that you are required to

27:13.733 --> 27:23.384
provide to the different echelons of command 
within the Corps. And within the Corps, you take

27:23.404 --> 27:43.268
and figure that you are serving or supporting, and

27:23.404 --> 27:43.268
the figure may vary, but anywhere between, say, 75 
to 150,000 soldiers. What about the other

27:44.800 --> 27:46.883
soldiers that you went with? Did they want to go 
voluntarily or were they dragged out there? No. My

27:53.993 --> 28:07.452
experience was that the majority of the soldiers, 
I only knew of two through my entire Vietnam

27:53.993 --> 28:07.452
experience, that hesitated to go to Vietnam. The 
average soldier wanted to go to Vietnam. I knew

28:13.589 --> 28:22.539
quite a few even those that were married and had 
families that volunteered to go to Vietnam.

28:23.360 --> 28:39.698
This may seem somewhat strange but it's true and 
the only thing that I can attribute that to is that

28:23.360 --> 28:39.698
in the military we all like to be considered as 
professionals and our job whether you want to put

28:40.235 --> 28:47.345
that tag on it or not, is to go out there and kill. We 
figured that if we did not serve in Vietnam, or

28:47.806 --> 28:55.297
those were my thoughts anyhow, we were not doing 
our job. Matter of fact,

28:56.839 --> 29:09.617
those that did, like I said, I knew two people that 
declined to go to Vietnam or did not want to go to

28:56.839 --> 29:09.617
Vietnam. they were looked upon as being somewhat 
odd. But in answer to your question, yes, the

29:14.491 --> 29:27.129
average soldier did want to go to Vietnam, some for 
patriotic reasons, even though those were very

29:14.491 --> 29:27.129
few exceptions. I think the majority of us did it 
for the professionalism. You had mentioned

29:32.757 --> 29:38.845
earlier that back in 1962, there wasn't that big of 
a problem with drugs. How about in 1965? I think the

29:43.130 --> 29:49.297
drugs in 1965 were just beginning to surface. 
Generally, not only in the military but also in

29:49.437 --> 29:57.527
society, drugs were not a problem in the early 
1960s. They were there. The heroin was there. The

30:02.153 --> 30:03.374
morphine was there. There were none of these... 
Elaborate drugs that are available now the

30:06.550 --> 30:36.338
cocaine was almost non-existent generally At 
that time it was the marijuana and in the Far East of

30:06.550 --> 30:36.338
the opium

30:06.550 --> 30:36.338
In the early 1960s we were going still going 
through the 1940 late 1940 1950 era whereas

30:06.550 --> 30:36.338
cigarette smoking and beer drinking, alcohol 
drinking was the thing to do. So if you're asking

30:41.981 --> 30:58.876
was there a drug problem in the sense where

30:41.981 --> 30:58.876
the beer drinking, the alcohol consumption was 
there, yes, we had that problem, if you want to call

30:41.981 --> 30:58.876
it a problem. But in as far as taking the hard drugs, 
no, it was almost nonexistent.

31:07.486 --> 31:23.761
I, on my second tour, I served as communication 
chief for a site and I had ranging anywhere between

31:07.486 --> 31:23.761
29 and 45 was the most, I had 45 soldiers.

31:30.088 --> 31:35.873
I became quite

31:38.182 --> 31:48.091
Familiar with their actions, I lived with them 24 
hours a day, 365 days a year, and I knew them pretty

31:38.182 --> 31:48.091
thoroughly. And I think I can honestly say that 
there was never any drugs in the number of people

31:48.111 --> 32:00.883
that I managed and supervised. Beer drinking, 
yes, we had it just about every day, but as far as

32:00.903 --> 32:06.248
drugs, no, we didn't have it. I left Vietnam, and to 
the best of my knowledge, drugs became a problem.

32:13.979 --> 32:23.047
Hard drugs became a problem in the 1968 and 69

32:13.979 --> 32:23.047
era. How had the relations between the Vietnamese 
Americans changed between 62 and 65?

32:33.897 --> 32:36.640
In the early 60s, in 1962, Like I say, we were still 
held somewhat in awe, even though that attitude

32:37.565 --> 32:47.656
may have been changing. In 1965, when I was there 
again, I think there was a total lack of respect,

32:47.676 --> 33:01.851
mutual respect. lack of respect between the 
Vietnamese and the Americans. The Vietnamese

33:07.830 --> 33:16.421
were taking the Americans as a means of making 
money. The Americans had adopted the attitude

33:18.564 --> 33:25.053
that the Vietnamese were lazy and didn't know how 
to fight a war. Consequently, the strategy

33:26.515 --> 33:32.142
changed at that time wherein the American soldier 
was now doing all the war-making, going out and

33:32.712 --> 33:52.144
actually fighting the war, and the Vietnamese 
were more or less held back in reserve and were

33:32.712 --> 33:52.144
providing support-type duties. There was a 100% 
turnabout. There was a lack of respect. they

33:57.586 --> 34:05.380
didn't like us and for the most part I think I can say 
that the Americans did not like the Vietnamese.

34:09.387 --> 34:12.373
What was the Vietnamese public's feelings about 
the war? The general public And by the general

34:16.840 --> 34:21.306
public, I'm talking about maybe 80, 90% of the 
population. And again, I'm talking about people

34:22.107 --> 34:27.273
that were living out in the country. They were 
farmers. They were poor people. They were

34:29.637 --> 34:30.678
uneducated. The only thing that these people knew 
anything about was what they heard on the radio,

34:32.941 --> 34:41.251
and radio was prevalent throughout Vietnam.

34:42.854 --> 34:43.995
The general public did not really care, I'm 
talking about the Vietnamese general public, did

34:44.718 --> 34:54.310
not really care about the controversy or the 
issues of the war. They were concerned about

34:54.371 --> 35:03.763
raising their crops, raising the family, doing 
the things that a family does. They were not too

35:03.983 --> 35:08.369
politically oriented. As far as the impression 
that I got, was that the general vietnamese didn't

35:14.452 --> 35:42.788
want a part of the war they wanted to be left alone 
however as the war escalated and as they lost our

35:14.452 --> 35:42.788
respect for us and as the enemy stepped up its 
propaganda and by the enemy i'm talking about the

35:14.452 --> 35:42.788
uh the north vietnamese in particular and also the 
Vietcong, as they stepped up their propaganda,

35:43.493 --> 36:06.664
then a lot of these people that did not want a part of 
the war listened to the propaganda being

35:43.493 --> 36:06.664
broadcast or published or distributed by the 
North Vietnamese. They became to accept us as the

36:07.245 --> 36:11.931
enemy. We were no longer there in the defense of 
their nation, though we were there in the defense

36:12.451 --> 36:28.349
of a government that was by then in disfavor with 
the general public. Was the Vietnamese's

36:29.831 --> 36:34.536
attitudes about fighting the war different from 
that of the Americans? The Vietnamese's you say

36:39.991 --> 37:04.243
their their feelings the soldier i guess in any 
country is

36:39.991 --> 37:04.243
going to feel that he is doing the right thing 
because he is a professional uh what their private

36:39.991 --> 37:04.243
thoughts may have been i cannot answer that 
however as a professional soldier they were more

37:04.831 --> 37:14.661
or less bound to do whatever their superiors 
command that they do. What about their tactics?

37:16.322 --> 37:19.325
Were they different in fighting this war? The 
Texas were definitely different. The United

37:22.748 --> 37:32.678
States, I think, went over with a concept of 
fighting a war like back in World War I and World War

37:33.130 --> 37:42.661
II, and maybe even Korea, where they were definite 
established battle lines. The military refers to

37:43.242 --> 37:47.747
them as the forward edge of the battle area. In 
Vietnam, there was not any such thing. The enemy

37:51.572 --> 37:55.977
could not be identified because he was not in 
uniform. The enemy did not have established

37:57.719 --> 38:02.985
battle lines They would surface during the night 
or even during the day unexpectedly. They would

38:10.094 --> 38:11.897
conduct a raid. They would retreat. They would 
become members of the general public during the

38:16.122 --> 38:20.507
day. That was one of the major reasons,

38:20.527 --> 38:31.841
I guess you might say, why we were not successful in 
Vietnam. We did not know who the enemy was. There

38:34.268 --> 38:42.680
were times when the enemy was found and attacked, 
or there were times when the enemy would attack.

38:43.161 --> 38:50.632
Battles would last for anywhere between a week at 
the very most to 15 days. The

38:51.613 --> 39:03.010
enemy would then dissolve, it seemed like, into 
almost nothing, or he would retreat to what at that

38:51.613 --> 39:03.010
time were considered sanctuaries. We refer to 
this as guerrilla warfare, where you strike and

39:03.648 --> 39:15.526
you retreat, where you make a stand for a few days 
and then disappear. We were not prepared

39:16.568 --> 39:26.263
for this type of insurgency type of warfare. We 
were prepared and we had the firepower to fight a

39:26.944 --> 39:31.731
conventional war. Guerrilla warfare is 
definitely not a conventional type of fighting,

39:33.280 --> 39:39.994
and we were not prepared for it. How was the 
military back in the States after seeing that the

39:41.116 --> 39:48.592
Vietnamese were fighting a guerrilla war? How did 
they change their... Their concept of fighting

39:54.222 --> 39:59.149
did not change. The United States wanted to 
continue with a conventional type of warfare.

40:06.279 --> 40:14.911
There were, of course, other means for trying to 
locate. For instance, we had numbers and numbers

40:18.607 --> 40:26.305
of helicopter units over there that would carry 
the soldier to the battlefield. However, as

40:26.325 --> 40:31.638
happened quite often, the enemy was just not 
there. How could you tell the difference between

40:31.658 --> 40:37.071
which Vietnamese were fighting with you or 
against you? That was what I tried to expand upon a

40:38.215 --> 40:46.983
few minutes ago that you did not know. It was very 
common and it happened numerous times. where

40:52.660 --> 41:08.603
Vietnamese employed by the U.S. military to 
conduct menial type labor around the garrison

40:52.660 --> 41:08.603
units were found to be Viet Cong. He

41:08.623 --> 41:21.402
would fit in with the general Vietnamese during 
the day, and during the night then he would be

41:08.623 --> 41:21.402
fighting a different There were also numerous 
instances of where these houseboys or housegirls

41:22.867 --> 41:35.542
or kitchen workers or general laborers were used 
for spying activities. They were used for

41:36.223 --> 41:42.691
destroying American property and general 
harassment. In retrospect, 24 years after you

41:42.711 --> 41:50.781
served in Vietnam first time, have your thoughts 
and attitudes changed about the war? They had

41:51.588 --> 41:53.210
definitely changed. You've got to remember that 
when I was in the military, and we're talking about

41:53.230 --> 42:05.686
this happened 24, 25 years ago, I was completely 
sold on the military. That was my job. That was my

42:06.847 --> 42:07.909
profession. I was not necessarily brainwashed, 
but I was part of the military establishment at

42:09.090 --> 42:17.121
that time. And as far as I was concerned, we were 
doing the right thing. And to a certain extent, I do

42:20.849 --> 42:27.339
not say that we were necessarily doing the wrong 
thing. In retrospect, yes. However, I think that

42:31.666 --> 42:45.387
we had no part in that war or at very best that it was 
very ill-advised.

42:47.189 --> 42:49.573
We were trying to be part and support a government 
that did not have the people's support, that

42:51.646 --> 43:16.742
abused its position,

42:51.646 --> 43:16.742
that got religion involved in the war. that did not 
have the general vietnamese public's better

43:18.038 --> 43:40.705
interest in mind they were being selfish trying to 
use the government for their own betterment uh

43:18.038 --> 43:40.705
that was a local war that needed to be resolved 
within their own self, you've got to understand

43:41.967 --> 43:55.960
that

44:00.395 --> 44:18.359
got to understand that different parts of the 
world, you are going to have different societies

44:00.395 --> 44:18.359
where they do not necessarily have the same 
beliefs that we in the United States do.

44:18.379 --> 44:23.906
They also, their economy is different from ours. 
Their customs are different than ours. We just had

44:28.412 --> 44:29.794
no business trying to fight the war for them i think 
it was very ill-advised thing however i also feel

44:30.297 --> 44:58.802
that given the same circumstances

44:30.297 --> 44:58.802
the u.s public is more or less bound to support 
their government's decision if they cannot

44:59.356 --> 45:17.033
support their government's decision, then they 
also do not have the right to violently, or through

44:59.356 --> 45:17.033
violent actions, oppose the decisions of their 
country. The people select, elect the politician

45:17.053 --> 45:27.102
to represent them at whatever levels of 
government. And in a case as controversial as the

45:28.364 --> 45:48.957
Vietnam War was, they still owe to those 
politicians the respect to try to solve whatever

45:28.364 --> 45:48.957
the problem be at whatever means available. What 
are some of the reasons you feel that we lost the

45:48.977 --> 45:52.262
war? There is several reasons, not any one of them,

45:53.035 --> 46:08.674
that by itself contributed to the loss of the war. 
First and foremost, I'm sure that anybody will

46:10.716 --> 46:22.671
agree, was the lack of support for the war, not only 
by the general public, but by the Congress of the

46:23.275 --> 46:27.599
United States. And by Congress of the United 
States, I'm talking about the fact that they

46:27.619 --> 46:38.290
controlled the actions of the military, and they 
controlled the purse strings. They controlled

46:38.310 --> 46:39.472
the money.

46:42.415 --> 46:50.683
The military, on one side, was being to go out and 
fight and win a war.

46:53.465 --> 47:10.579
On the other hand, you had the

46:53.465 --> 47:10.579
political activists, the anti-Vietnam War 
demonstrators, and you had your congressmen.
