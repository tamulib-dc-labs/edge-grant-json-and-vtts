WEBVTT

00:02.444 --> 00:10.077
And I think it was a grave mistake for these 
fraternities to exist on this campus. In your

00:10.477 --> 00:13.623
student days there was a bonfire. Yes. Describe if 
you were... We used to go out and gather all kinds of

00:15.225 --> 00:21.516
trash. And we go to these, they had a lot of sawmills 
around here. And they'd always keep the trash for

00:25.189 --> 00:28.938
us. They knew we were gonna come after it. So we'd 
get the trucks and we'd pick up all that stuff and we

00:30.722 --> 00:34.712
laid it out. We didn't build it up. And they were 
delighted to have you all haul it away. Oh, yes. And

00:40.507 --> 00:45.194
we built it up just about the size of the height of a 
person. And we started off way up here, as high as we

00:45.214 --> 00:48.139
can. And we'd diminish it down below. And then we'd 
start the fire from going down below and let it go

00:50.102 --> 00:55.330
all the way up. I had a great time. About how long did 
you all work on it? A week or a month? Oh, maybe a

01:00.778 --> 01:03.282
couple of weeks. But when I saw that 110 bonfire 
that I came here and I saw that with that outhouse on

01:04.274 --> 01:13.729
top, you know, I didn't laugh. I did not laugh. I 
said, this is dangerous. Did y'all put an outhouse

01:19.097 --> 01:22.463
on bonfire when you were here? No, we didn't. We 
didn't do anything like that. And did almost

01:26.769 --> 01:29.674
everybody work on bonfire then? Well, I would say 
it was a freshman deal more than anything else, but

01:30.650 --> 01:37.178
everybody really did work on it. And it was on the 
drill field? It was on the drill field. Then did

01:41.283 --> 01:43.365
y'all have yell practices? Oh, yes, we had yell 
practice. We didn't have midnight yell practice.

01:47.730 --> 01:54.799
We had yell practice, but it was all done before the 
game or something like that. And if it were a night

01:54.939 --> 01:59.104
game, I would have it before the game. And was Yale 
practice held on the steps of the Y? Steps of the Y,

02:02.564 --> 02:04.126
that's right. Did y'all throw Yale leaders in the 
fish pond? No, I don't think we did anything like

02:08.611 --> 02:12.296
that. Were they called Yale leaders? Yes. And did 
y'all have hand signals? Oh yes, same thing we got

02:17.082 --> 02:19.905
now. What was your favorite Yale? Did you have a 
favorite? Oh no, all of them were good. You know the

02:26.352 --> 02:31.159
spirit of Aggieland came in way after I graduated. 
We had the hullabaloo, connect, connect, we had

02:32.081 --> 02:41.817
the band playing songs and so forth. We didn't have 
too many. Did you all talk about the twelfth man?

02:47.549 --> 02:50.992
12th man came in in 1921, wasn't it? 21, 22. The 12th 
man was betrayed, but not like he's betrayed now.

03:01.303 --> 03:02.504
How was he betrayed then? Just as a reference.

03:09.871 --> 03:12.174
The games were played at Kyle Field. Did just about 
everybody in the community go to the games? I think

03:17.283 --> 03:18.144
so. I worked 25 cents an hour when I was a freshman 
laying the seats to the new Kyle Field.

03:32.243 --> 03:34.285
I laid a lot of seats. Now, originally the stadium 
was part of Dean Kyle's agricultural area. Yeah.

03:43.574 --> 03:49.861
Were there any ag fields down in that part of the 
campus still when you got here? No. It was just Kyle

03:51.943 --> 03:54.065
Field. Where was the baseball stadium then? Or 
baseball diamond I should say. Baseball diamond

03:58.510 --> 04:05.357
was adjacent to Kyle Field as I recall. They just 
had a little stand up that wouldn't hold 100

04:05.417 --> 04:09.041
people. And basketball was Basketball was in the, 
in that,

04:10.962 --> 04:18.309
what's the name of it? I want to say Downs Notatory, 
but that's not the right name. Basketball was. Did

04:26.397 --> 04:28.419
you and your buddies go to basketball games? Oh, 
yes. Did y'all make a lot of noise? Oh, we always

04:31.682 --> 04:32.923
made noise. Who were the favorite opponents then 
in athletics? Well, I was on the freshman baseball

04:38.468 --> 04:48.390
team, and I tell this story, which is funny in a way. 
And we had a coach by the name of Bender, I think it

04:49.352 --> 04:54.344
was. He was an Indian. Chief Bender, we'd call him. 
So I was an outfielder, and I was fairly good. So I

05:04.048 --> 05:09.835
told them, I said, Coach, I'm not going to come back 
and play next year. Why? Well, my studies are

05:12.638 --> 05:16.021
getting pretty hard. I don't have the time. So I 
said, OK, all right. So we were playing TCU, the

05:23.250 --> 05:26.413
last game. We had a man on second and a man on first. 
And I said, he was looking for a pinch hitter. I

05:38.443 --> 05:39.324
said, Coach, let me hit. I'll bring him in. Let me 
hit.

05:44.190 --> 05:47.335
And finally, he said, OK.

05:50.118 --> 05:52.401
So to make a long story short, I struck out. Now he 
was going this way to the TCU coach to say goodbye,

05:54.018 --> 06:05.012
and I was coming this way back to the dugout. So we 
met. He looked at me and he just used one word. He

06:09.878 --> 06:10.839
said, shit.

06:14.684 --> 06:16.626
So that was the end of your athletic career? That 
was the end of my baseball career. Oh, I did. I went

06:21.463 --> 06:27.231
out for track when I was a freshman. Was Andy 
Anderson a... Andy Anderson. He was a coach, I

06:30.715 --> 06:32.998
think. Track coach. Track. Describe him. Oh, he 
was a different... He was a man that wasn't too big

06:37.424 --> 06:41.210
by your size, I think. Nice guy? Great guy. Great 
guy. See, he's the one that Coach Bible told in

06:47.017 --> 06:50.502
Dallas... to go up in the stands and get to come down 
and put on his uniform because he had played

06:50.870 --> 07:07.710
football over at Mississippi College where they 
had too many guys get hurt and Mississippi State

06:50.870 --> 07:07.710
then beat them. And that's why Coach Bible wanted 
him to put on the uniform. I remember whenever we

07:13.537 --> 07:20.185
had a little track meet that hit those of us who were 
runners. He'd get us underneath the stand and give

07:21.059 --> 07:27.369
us a tablespoon full of honey. I mean it like that. 
He said, he'll do it 10 minutes or 15 minutes before

07:31.696 --> 07:36.644
he's supposed to run. He said, but that honey goes 
into the system so fast. He said, it gives you

07:40.890 --> 07:42.773
energy. Do you think it did? Sure it did. I still 
believe it to this day. Whenever I have honey in my

07:47.519 --> 07:54.047
office, whenever I have a downer, I fill that 
field. After a day's work, I fill down. I take a

07:56.631 --> 08:00.295
teaspoonful of honey. And that field house was 
DeWare Field House, wasn't it? I think you're

08:03.299 --> 08:04.120
right. Yeah, yeah,

08:04.220 --> 08:08.025
yeah. Describe the Aggie band in that era, in your 
student days. How big was it? What did it do? Oh, it

08:16.703 --> 08:20.307
wasn't as big as it is now, of course, but it was 
there. They did their job. Did you all respect

08:25.193 --> 08:26.154
them? Oh, sure, we respected the band. Were they 
called BQs then? I don't remember. See, later,

08:33.842 --> 08:38.147
World War II, they're called BQs, band queers. 
It's a strange kind of respect. No, we respected

08:42.153 --> 08:46.741
the man. I don't think I ever heard anybody say 
derogatory remark on the man. Among the students,

08:52.490 --> 08:59.121
what was the most respected student body 
leadership position? Corps Commander?

09:06.697 --> 09:16.372
The Corps commander had a lot of leadership, you 
might say, emulated leadership. But I think the

09:16.993 --> 09:19.097
president of this class. Oh, really? Of the senior 
class? Oh, yeah, president of the senior class.

09:23.884 --> 09:30.114
I'm trying to think of his name.

09:30.134 --> 09:33.119
Howe, Howe, H-O-W-E. Okay. Anyway, he would meet 
with us. The corps commander didn't meet with you.

09:41.750 --> 09:42.030
I see. Corps commander had to do his special work 
and that is see to it that the military science and

09:42.791 --> 09:54.488
tactics were taught and that discipline was 
carried out and things like that. Did you all elect

09:54.989 --> 09:56.611
the student? Oh yes, we elected them. Was it a show 
of hands or a ballot? Now you got me there. I forgot.

10:04.915 --> 10:06.417
And the corps commander was... I forgot. I forgot. 
I don't think it was... I don't know. I don't know. I

10:11.304 --> 10:13.047
can't answer that. Were there some... Were there 
the sons of some famous Texans here when you were

10:14.068 --> 10:17.693
here? Sons of rich Texans or important 
politicians? There were a lot of rich Texans, sons

10:23.041 --> 10:28.229
of rich Texans, but it's a funny thing about that. 
Once the student has been described or dedicated

10:36.269 --> 10:39.893
in a way that he was classified as wealthy. He 
wasn't contacted too much.

10:45.820 --> 10:51.205
Students stayed away from him because they 
couldn't match his dollars. It's funny. The same

10:54.409 --> 10:57.612
thing goes on today. Were there any Jewish 
students here then? Oh yes. Were they accepted? I

11:04.417 --> 11:06.519
know there were. There were no defamation taking 
place. I don't think, you know, the whole time I was

11:12.004 --> 11:23.294
here, the five years, I don't think that I heard 
very much racial or any kind of defamation on

11:12.004 --> 11:23.294
groups. We loved each other, you know. When you 
only have 2,000 in the school, you're not going to

11:26.837 --> 11:34.103
go around causing a lot of damage. About how many 
students had a car?

11:39.633 --> 11:41.837
Not many, and they could not park. They could not 
park on the campus. No way. Where did they keep

11:46.764 --> 11:48.066
their car? I don't know, but you couldn't park on 
the campus. My senior year, I was able to buy one of

11:51.110 --> 11:59.803
those Ford, flip one of those Fords. I remember 
paying them $75, and I was going to pay them $375,

12:00.661 --> 12:10.634
and I had to keep it outside the campus. You could 
not keep a car on the campus. Have you heard that

12:14.459 --> 12:15.680
before? No, I did not know that. You check it. So it 
was a school rule. School rule that no student

12:22.369 --> 12:25.653
could keep a car on the campus. Well, where did you 
park your car then? I parked it outside. All right.

12:29.686 --> 12:39.558
I found the place someplace and kept it outside 
maybe without any cover, but you could not. I

12:41.620 --> 12:43.062
remember that distinctly. Did you ever go to, was 
it called the Quack Shack then? I don't remember

12:47.247 --> 12:50.130
anything like that. The health center, what was 
the campus medical service? Was there a doctor

12:56.498 --> 12:58.140
here? Dr. Marsh? There was always a doctor here. 
And where was his office? I think it was the

13:03.354 --> 13:05.176
administration building. Oh, okay. Okay. Was the 
Aggieland Inn built yet over at Northgate, a place

13:08.119 --> 13:14.886
for people out of town to spend the night? No. No, 
no. Where did a visitor stay when they came to? In

13:20.312 --> 13:20.832
Bryan. In Bryan? Navasota, Hearn. We didn't have 
anything around here. uh and uh most people

13:27.449 --> 13:48.276
arrived at the college railroad station most of 
them rode the train and a lot of them drove and

13:27.449 --> 13:48.276
during the graduation then of course everybody 
had were was permitted to park But I remember

13:49.167 --> 14:00.146
distinctly, and I'd like for you to check that, 
that you could not park any car, no student could

13:49.167 --> 14:00.146
park any car on the campus.

14:01.088 --> 14:03.412
Did you have any dates while you were a student? Oh, 
yes. Where did you get those dates? Navasota,

14:05.435 --> 14:07.058
Hearn, and Bryan. How did you make first contact 
with them? Of course, during the freshman year, I

14:13.332 --> 14:16.176
didn't do much of anything. I didn't have time. I 
just worked, worked. Sophomore year, I was still

14:20.061 --> 14:23.606
working. But anyway, I met people here and there. 
And would somebody say something about going to

14:26.710 --> 14:32.118
Hearn, that they had a little party, I'd go over 
there. And if I met some young lady that I thought

14:32.398 --> 14:41.230
might be interested in me, I made advances that 
way. And in my senior year, I went with a nice lady

14:42.070 --> 14:47.017
from Bryan. She was very beautiful. Where would 
y'all go on a date? Well, they had places in Bryan

14:54.869 --> 14:58.915
you could go to, a lot of places to eat. Were there 
places to go dance? All the dances that were held

15:02.521 --> 15:04.804
were held here. What were the big dances? A special 
occasion, the ring dance was the biggest. And we

15:11.609 --> 15:13.091
had some other... Boot dance? Had boot dance, ring 
dance. And how were those dates treated at an A&M

15:17.295 --> 15:22.019
dance? Oh, with great respect.

15:27.825 --> 15:34.572
I don't think there's been any incident where a 
young lady declared

15:34.838 --> 15:38.643
abuse. I've never heard of any. Were there, did you 
all have girls come down from CIA on the train? From

15:48.537 --> 15:49.258
Denton? Oh man, I should say so. They'd come down 
with them big time. And how did you get a date with

15:56.288 --> 15:59.513
one of them in advance? Well, one of the students 
would know somebody up there, and then that

16:00.640 --> 16:16.201
student would get in touch with the woman he knows 
up there, and she would bring just a friend of hers

16:00.640 --> 16:16.201
down to meet you. And that's how it was. Did they 
exchange pictures sometimes in advance? I don't

16:21.028 --> 16:22.590
remember. Where did they stay when they were here, 
those girls from out of town? Well, I forgot. Why in

16:28.260 --> 16:29.642
the world did they stay? But I think they had a place 
for them, designated. Well, I know in later years

16:33.268 --> 16:37.114
they would vacate a dormitory. The guys would move 
out and let the girls stay in one of the... I don't

16:40.840 --> 16:41.301
know. You ask me a question, I don't know.

16:45.829 --> 16:47.552
We're going to have to cut this now. All righty. 
We'll stop right now. It's on. He realized that for

16:54.387 --> 17:05.696
Texas A&M to grow and be respected throughout the 
world, that it had to become a university. He also

17:06.657 --> 17:13.623
realized that the only way it could become a 
university, it had to go coeducational.

17:14.984 --> 17:24.192
And so when he announced it, there was such a loud 
noise against it that you wouldn't believe.

17:24.661 --> 17:28.445
Practically every Aggie all over the world said, 
this is crazy. What are you doing? This is a men's

17:29.927 --> 17:31.188
school. Leave it alone.

17:35.774 --> 17:42.602
And I would visit with him, and he'd say, you're 
going to have to help me, Mike. You're going to have

17:42.642 --> 17:43.603
to help me. He talked to these people. You know a lot 
of them. Talk to them. We've got to get this

17:47.687 --> 17:49.189
through. He was afraid that if he just voluntarily 
said, this is the way it's going to be, It wouldn't

17:54.800 --> 17:57.446
work like he wanted it. So he had a solicitation 
program going. And I mean, I wasn't the only one.

18:03.759 --> 18:06.365
There must have been, he must have selected, I 
don't know how many. Talk about this thing. Talk

18:07.968 --> 18:09.391
about it. And I remember talking to Aggies. and 
Beaumont and Houston, Port Otta and elsewhere in

18:12.620 --> 18:21.092
that area, and I would go visit and let them know 
that this is very important. But even then, when it

18:21.552 --> 18:29.203
looked like that it would be welcome, there were 
still loud noises against it. You'd be surprised.

18:31.826 --> 18:33.108
They didn't want to change it. They wanted to keep 
it a men's school, and they wanted to keep it

18:33.188 --> 18:38.435
military. But there was a lot of them at that time 
were not military. That's broken off. I'm the one

18:44.212 --> 18:48.378
that wrote the original report recommending 
those changes to Mr. Rudder. Really? I was the

18:49.719 --> 18:53.244
author of that report for the faculty and staff. 
For core education? Yes, sir. And I now know when we

18:55.266 --> 18:59.231
first turned it in, Mr. Rudder was afraid that he 
couldn't make it happen. That was 61. Yes, sir. He

19:05.459 --> 19:10.125
worked on it 61, 62, and then established it in 63. 
That's right. I now know that one of the key, key

19:12.745 --> 19:19.505
influences was Lyndon Baines Johnson. That 
apparently, see when Mr. Rutter would go to

19:19.525 --> 19:25.523
Washington to try to get money for A&M from the 
federal government, He and Lyndon had known each

19:25.790 --> 19:33.958
other well, and he had helped Lyndon in that 1948 
Senate campaign in the Hill Country. And

19:34.319 --> 19:37.782
apparently, this is circumstantial evidence of 
what Mr. Rudder said here and there and there,

19:37.822 --> 19:49.154
apparently Lyndon put his arm around him and said, 
Earl, if you expect to keep coming to Washington to

19:37.822 --> 19:49.154
get money out of the federal government from A&M, 
you've got to get it growing. It's not growing. The

19:50.575 --> 19:53.518
other schools are passing you by, and you're going 
to be left out. You don't have a choice on

19:53.920 --> 19:56.304
integration. The courts have already decided 
that. Now, you better admit women because the

19:58.627 --> 20:01.772
courts will probably do that. I'll back you. John 
and Nellie Conley are close friends of your wife,

20:03.474 --> 20:10.104
Margaret, all four years from the University of 
Texas. He'll back you. Sterling Evans, he and I

20:11.886 --> 20:15.612
have done some land deals together. Your board 
chairman, he's been for coeducation since he was a

20:16.273 --> 20:20.740
freshman there in 1917. He'll back you. Buck 
Wirus. Yeah. Wirus will help you. Olin Teague,

20:28.903 --> 20:32.489
your classmate, he'll back you. Jake Pickle, 
congressman from Austin, you all have been

20:32.509 --> 20:37.258
acquainted since you were eighth graders. He'll 
back you. And another person that sometimes gets

20:39.041 --> 20:44.751
left out is the state senator here, Bill Mohr. yeah 
the bull of the brazos yeah i remember he was a

20:45.085 --> 21:14.704
strong proponent for co-education yeah no i got a 
lot of flack i was by being the junior member in

20:45.085 --> 21:14.704
terms of rank i got to take the minutes and write the 
report and my last conversation with mr rutter in

20:45.085 --> 21:14.704
the spring of 1970 before his death i love to 
describe it i'm in as chairman of the faculty

20:45.085 --> 21:14.704
library committee begging for more money for the 
library Mr. Rudder looked at me and he said, you

21:15.757 --> 21:19.702
people always want more money for the library. Do 
you think the students have read all the books

21:19.982 --> 21:23.367
they've already got? And I laughed. And he said, 
I'll do the best I can. Then I said, Mr. Rudder, you

21:27.693 --> 21:29.755
remember that report I wrote? He said, oh, yes. I 
said, only you could have made that happen. He

21:34.742 --> 21:37.986
leaned back and grinned and said, why would you say 
that? I said, sir, they couldn't say you weren't a

21:38.988 --> 21:43.594
Texan, you weren't an Aggie, you hadn't been in the 
Corps, you hadn't served your country, that you

21:44.249 --> 21:55.902
didn't work hard, that you didn't have a good wife, 
that you didn't know anybody in Austin or

21:44.249 --> 21:55.902
Washington. And he leaned back and laughed and he 
said, oh, I never thought of any of that. No, I think

22:02.430 --> 22:05.894
that he was... Well, I'm glad to know that you had 
something to do with it. Tell me, I hear or heard

22:08.597 --> 22:13.142
rumors that at a region board meeting, there was 
some knockdowns between the nine members on that.

22:21.765 --> 22:23.687
Do you know what happened? I don't, but I 
understand that Mr. Evans changed two or three

22:23.707 --> 22:32.796
votes, that he got some people that were no, he 
moved them to yes. And apparently they got some

22:33.737 --> 22:43.247
phone calls from maybe John Connolly, that Mr. 
Evans was a key person in that. uh a story that was

22:44.476 --> 23:08.813
that was trying to i'll tell you right now i i would 
go around saying god if this thing doesn't work oh

22:44.476 --> 23:08.813
we'll never be it we'll never go anywhere in the 
first draft i put a line that i took out in the final

22:44.476 --> 23:08.813
draft i wish i'd left it in i said we are afraid if a m 
doesn't make these changes it will end up being

22:44.476 --> 23:08.813
like the citadel or vmi As small. That's right. 
Military. Right. And as it is, we're a major league

23:12.258 --> 23:17.406
player, no question about it. I love to tell the 
story. Do you know Charlie Babcock? Beaumont?

23:22.755 --> 23:23.075
Yes, sir. Absolutely. Okay. Charlie, he was a good 
friend. And you remember, he was one of the

23:28.063 --> 23:32.029
opponents. That's right, he was. He sent his ring 
back. Wyra showed me his ring. He sent his ring back

23:36.596 --> 23:38.462
and his diploma. He had been the secretary 
treasurer of the Beaumont A&M Club for 30 years.

23:42.795 --> 23:43.297
That's right. He resigned that. He said, I will 
never, ever again attend anything related to A&M.

23:49.630 --> 23:55.397
Well, he wrote so many letters, I thought he must be 
a villain with thorns and a forked tail. I remember

23:56.618 --> 23:57.519
that. I remember that. All right, the happy 
ending. About five years after all of that, I'm to

23:59.882 --> 24:10.634
speak at the Beaumont A&M Club on the 50th 
anniversary of their never having missed a Monday

23:59.882 --> 24:10.634
night. And they were going to honor him as the most 
loyal, productive, most hardworking, and he had

24:16.715 --> 24:21.179
said, I'm not coming. I told you, I'm not coming to 
anything right at A&M. All right, I go over with

24:24.203 --> 24:34.713
Buck Wirus on the A&M plane, and when we get to the 
Harvest Club in Beaumont, where they were having

24:24.203 --> 24:34.713
it, they said, Mr. Babcock's here. And I said, I 
want to see that SOB. I want to see what he looks

24:37.135 --> 24:38.357
like. Well, at the end of the whole evening, as a 
total surprise, they said, now we'd like the

24:45.402 --> 24:48.905
hardest working Aggie in this room to come up. Here 
came Charlie Babcock, wasn't very big. No, no, he

24:52.828 --> 24:53.769
wasn't. And they said, Charlie, we want to honor 
you and thank you. We know how deeply you cared

24:56.631 --> 25:03.557
about some of those things, but we hope you 
understand the changes. They stood and cheered.

25:06.119 --> 25:10.803
He walked to the microphone and started crying, 
and I'll never forget what he said. Please forgive

25:11.964 --> 25:13.706
me, ladies and gentlemen. I was wrong. All right, 
as we're coming back on the plane, I said, Wyrus, I

25:16.334 --> 25:20.558
don't understand this guy. I thought he was a 
villain. Tell me about him. He said, well, he went

25:22.840 --> 25:28.285
to A&M, he said he thought he majored in business, 
went to work at the refinery. He didn't become

25:28.706 --> 25:29.747
rich. He didn't become famous. But he was a nice 
guy. His wife taught school. Their daughter died

25:34.791 --> 25:40.176
one day on the school playground of an unexpected 
heart problem. Then their son, while he was at A&M,

25:44.532 --> 25:48.838
dies accidentally at summer camp at Fort Sill, And 
then Wyra stopped, and I said, and you're going to

25:50.000 --> 26:01.874
tell me he transferred the love he had for his 
children to his alma mater, and he honestly,

25:50.000 --> 26:01.874
sincerely thought A&M was making a mistake. Wyra 
said, that's right. Yeah, he did. I said, I forgive

26:04.357 --> 26:05.499
him. I forgive him. I remember Charlie. Oh, man. 
It's funny you called his name. And the big joke

26:10.505 --> 26:17.593
that night, what are the Greek names? Coconels. 
Coconels. Janelle. That's right. Let's call them

26:22.409 --> 26:23.371
Pete. That's right. Okay, the chairman, the 
president of the Beaumont A&M Club that night in

26:29.993 --> 26:41.370
talking about co-education, he said, now some of 
you don't remember that they allowed, when we GIs

26:29.993 --> 26:41.370
came back from World War II, our wives could go to 
summer school. And tonight at supper, my wife told

26:42.231 --> 26:54.029
me she only had 12 hours of credit at A&M, but that 
she had more grade points than all the Coconos

26:42.231 --> 26:54.029
brothers put together. Well, everybody stood up 
and cheered.
