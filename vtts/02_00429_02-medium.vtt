WEBVTT

00:03.558 --> 00:06.643
the smart bombs and watching them too? Yeah, I was 
watching Channel 9, and they showed about these

00:06.663 --> 00:19.444
laser-guided or radio-guided bombs, how they get 
them to blow up their target. And, you know, I

00:19.464 --> 00:23.271
pieced two and two together. That's what we did. We 
helped conduct their experiments and perfect

00:24.573 --> 00:30.122
their laser bombs and stuff. What do you think of 
that? I mean, all those men that got lost when

00:32.069 --> 00:38.277
trying to retrieve that bomb, did you think that 
was the time and place to be doing something like

00:32.069 --> 00:38.277
that? No, no. But, you know, I figured somebody had 
to do it. You know, if it wasn't done there, it might

00:43.424 --> 00:52.176
have been done under worse conditions. Maybe 
something, maybe the enemy might have got it and

00:52.196 --> 01:00.126
ruined whatever plans we had. for that weapon.

01:05.314 --> 01:13.123
But it was just a part of us being mobile, 
amphibious, that we could go anywhere.

01:16.006 --> 01:28.020
I think it was harder on us because we not only had to 
maintain this vehicle weight, 34 tons, that we had

01:16.006 --> 01:28.020
to keep going over here. an infantryman out in the 
jungle. All he's got is his rifle and his pack on his

01:31.645 --> 01:34.188
back. Yet we had an extra burden to haul all over 
Vietnam. Did you ever have any close buddies that

01:43.340 --> 01:45.584
were wounded? And were you ever wounded? Yeah, I 
had a few, quite a few that were wounded. I was never

01:55.938 --> 01:57.019
hurt. I was lucky. Just bullets would bounce 
around me from sniper fire. But I guess I was really

02:05.050 --> 02:15.120
fortunate in that we had one guy that got shot in the 
throat. And the way the doctors told us, he could

02:15.280 --> 02:22.888
have lived if he hadn't given up. But he just gave up 
and died.

02:30.927 --> 02:39.660
And there was a lot of guys that every once in a while 
we'd have to haul back some dead bodies inside in

02:30.927 --> 02:39.660
the body banks. And that was pretty gross. But the 
way I felt that if I ever got shot or if I was going to

02:44.146 --> 02:51.937
get killed, I didn't want to see it coming. Just get 
caught completely by surprise.

02:58.501 --> 03:01.664
Not even see the man that shot me. So when y'all ever 
killed any B.C. male like that one time in the

03:04.646 --> 03:08.650
village, what did you do with those bodies? I mean, 
were there any, like, kind of, I've heard stories

03:08.870 --> 03:14.615
where, like, taken off the ears or... I never saw it 
done. I never saw it done. I heard about stuff, but I

03:18.439 --> 03:27.647
never saw anybody with ears or body parts or 
anything, or teeth or anything. I'm not saying it

03:28.977 --> 03:36.125
never happened, because it's been my experience 
with people that people are capable of anything.

03:37.727 --> 03:41.812
But I never saw it done.

03:41.852 --> 03:43.013
And I wouldn't do it. I wouldn't be a part of it. The 
worst kind of tortures I ever saw were done because

03:47.639 --> 03:54.246
we carried the Korean soldiers, too. Now, they 
were real cold-blooded torturers. They would,

03:58.576 --> 04:11.713
when they were interrogating Viet Cong 
prisoners, they would torture them with stick

03:58.576 --> 04:11.713
thorns in their ears and then slap them into their 
ears. And we were nearby because we had to

04:12.614 --> 04:17.721
transport them. We could hear their screams and 
everything. And they'd hang people. When they

04:22.528 --> 04:28.195
were through torturing them, shoot them in the 
back of the head if they were too... cut up or

04:29.002 --> 04:30.244
emulated. But it was mainly done by the Koreans. So 
y'all just had a policy of what turning the other

04:34.170 --> 04:39.457
way until they were done with their business. 
Right.

04:43.323 --> 04:46.768
Any of the buddies that you ever had, did you ever 
feel like maybe they were losing it? Did you ever

04:47.149 --> 04:49.953
feel like, my god, I want to get out of here? And you 
just didn't think you could handle another day?

04:52.516 --> 04:56.342
Did you ever see any instances of your fellow peers 
breaking down? Yeah, I saw some would break down to

04:57.250 --> 05:15.455
the point where they would like cowardice in the 
face of the enemy, or they didn't want to go on a

04:57.250 --> 05:15.455
patrol, or they turned to drugs.

05:19.501 --> 05:26.430
I'd say one third of possible You know, 100 would go 
bad and break down.

05:35.665 --> 05:38.429
So are you saying that where did they get drugs and 
when did they use them? I mean, when they were out on

05:38.449 --> 05:40.592
patrol or what? Drugs you could get just driving 
down the road. The sellers would be standing

05:43.877 --> 05:51.107
alongside the road with big packs of marijuana 
cigarettes like that in their hand. And we'd be in a

05:51.768 --> 05:55.894
convoy, and whenever the convoy would slow down, 
Some guys would buy it. This one guy knew he was

06:00.065 --> 06:03.148
buying it and shipping it home.

06:06.772 --> 06:07.914
He was from Chicago. He was supplying his buddies 
in Chicago, and they would send him the money to buy

06:08.574 --> 06:12.959
it. And then whenever we went out on patrol or a 
mission, we would make sure there weren't any

06:15.682 --> 06:24.331
dopers in our outfit. How do you do that? search 
them or, you know, you can tell by living with the

06:25.338 --> 06:29.863
guys. Because marijuana, you can smell it. It 
smells weird. I don't know if you've ever smelled

06:33.847 --> 06:35.589
it. No, I smell it too. And then you could tell the 
guys are spaced out because they act kind of out of

06:37.130 --> 06:45.519
it, you know. So before we went out on patrol, we 
knew who was with it and who was on drugs, and we

06:53.232 --> 06:59.239
wouldn't let them go with us. Or else we'd search 
them for their stuff and make them leave it behind.

07:03.344 --> 07:11.173
If there was a pot smoker or two, we'd go ahead and 
take them, but without their marijuana. Did you

07:11.193 --> 07:13.036
ever smoke marijuana? I mean, did you ever think? I 
did try it once, but it made me sick. It scared me. It

07:19.263 --> 07:22.547
kind of like paralyzed me. It scared me so bad I 
never did it again, just that one time. And it was in

07:28.043 --> 07:29.766
a tent. We had our corpsman. He was a pot smoker.

07:37.899 --> 07:40.924
He had what was called a pot party. I didn't want any 
part of it. I guess it was just my attitude, my...

07:49.443 --> 07:51.785
deep down personal resentment for it. It caused me 
to have a bad reaction to it. And I felt like I was

07:54.988 --> 07:57.550
paralyzed sitting there. And I thought to myself, 
oh shit, what am I going to do if a Viet Cong attack

07:58.531 --> 08:02.795
now? Or if they're coming? I felt so immobilized 
that

08:05.598 --> 08:15.306
an enemy could be holding a gun on me and I couldn't 
move. I was just paralyzed. So I never tried it

08:16.227 --> 08:18.129
again. Never did. didn't want anything to do with 
it. So is that what y'all did on your free time? I

08:24.357 --> 08:27.361
mean, did y'all mainly work at night and then in the 
day, what did you do? Yeah, well, we maintained our

08:27.922 --> 08:34.311
vehicles and then we had to keep our own living 
areas clean. And then we were sent on details to

08:36.754 --> 08:43.184
clean different areas at camp. Our human waste, we 
had to burn it every day. And then we had to dig

08:50.294 --> 08:50.855
bunkers. Whenever we got shelled, we had to hide 
underground in these bunkers. And then the

08:56.981 --> 09:18.384
command tractors needed extra maintenance 
because

08:56.981 --> 09:18.384
they had four sets of radios, one for aircraft, one 
for naval gunfire and artillery fire, and then

08:56.981 --> 09:18.384
basic headquarters communications. So They 
moved us. Every once in a while, we had to do a

09:21.634 --> 09:45.224
certain amount of time with the headquarters 
platoon to stay in touch with evacuation

09:21.634 --> 09:45.224
procedures, the mobile command headquarters, 
the operation of the vehicle, and how to stay in

09:21.634 --> 09:45.224
tune with command decisions and stuff. And then 
we'd rotate to the other platoons another

09:49.103 --> 10:17.760
platoon, the platoon with the best vehicles would 
be sent the farthest out on the jungle patrols and

09:49.103 --> 10:17.760
there was this one operation it was called 
Operation Snaggle Tooth and it was an ongoing

09:49.103 --> 10:17.760
operation the one platoon with the best tractors 
would always go on that operation and we got to go on

09:49.103 --> 10:17.760
it once because They reassigned us and reformed us 
into the Marines were going to make one final push

10:18.837 --> 10:26.186
on this Operation Snaggletooth. And off the 
coast, there was this island that was all Viet Cong

10:28.028 --> 10:33.956
held. And they'd sent the Marines out there to try 
and wipe them out. But they were real fierce. It was

10:45.530 --> 10:48.253
a hardcore North Vietnamese army. And there was a 
lot of Marines lost before they finally did take

10:49.229 --> 10:54.555
that island. And at night when we were on beach 
guard, bodies would come floating across the

10:54.575 --> 11:01.402
ocean and wash up on the shore. Some would be North 
Vietnamese. And every once in a while, there'd be a

11:04.666 --> 11:08.570
Marine in there. You all would collect them? Yeah. 
Turn them over to wherever. If it was a Marine,

11:13.775 --> 11:18.240
well, we'd turn it over to our graves 
registration. And if it was an enemy, we'd turn it

11:19.790 --> 11:31.928
over to the...

11:19.790 --> 11:31.928
Our intelligence unit would search the bodies. G2 
was intelligence. They'd come and claim the

11:34.151 --> 11:48.733
bodies and search them, try to figure out if he was a 
real North Vietnamese or a Viet Cong insurgent

11:34.151 --> 11:48.733
from the area. Were

11:49.675 --> 11:55.281
your officers ever obsessed with body counts? 
Like, that was important? And did you feel that was

11:56.723 --> 12:00.627
a good rate or way to measure things? Our officers 
weren't. It was mainly the infantry outfits that

12:01.808 --> 12:05.833
we supported. Whenever we'd take them supplies, 
this one company was always going out in the jungle

12:06.454 --> 12:16.585
and getting into heavy combat. They called him 
Suicide Charlie. because their officers had

12:19.848 --> 12:24.253
suicidal tendencies. The missions they would 
send them on, they were always outnumbered and

12:24.473 --> 12:28.498
outgunned. And then there was another company 
called Dying Delta Company, D Company, because

12:30.200 --> 12:38.470
they would get shot up and overrun. Because of the 
area, the jungle they were in, the enemy had real

12:40.112 --> 12:48.842
eyes. strength and they would attack them and kill 
quite a few. So those were about the worst infantry

12:54.606 --> 13:00.795
companies we had ever gotten mixed up with. Dying 
Delta and Suicide Charlie. How were the

13:05.141 --> 13:06.183
conditions like? Do you think you were fed well or 
maybe compared to other officers? Yeah, we got to

13:12.252 --> 13:14.475
eat a lot better than Because we would carry the 
food to the infantry, and every once in a while

13:15.839 --> 13:24.573
they'd try to give the infantry a good hot meal. So 
they'd send us to this big mess hall in Da Nang, and

13:25.555 --> 13:36.553
we'd load up with these insulated canisters of hot 
food and take it out to the infantry. Well, and

13:37.094 --> 13:39.498
along the way we'd help ourselves. And... So we 
were fortunate in that area. We got to handle all

13:45.499 --> 13:50.704
the supplies, and when you handle all the 
supplies, you get to pick the best. So we were

13:52.425 --> 13:55.028
fortunate. But then, too, again, we had to 
maintain this vehicle. Every once in a while, when

13:57.410 --> 14:12.323
we replaced some of the parts that weighed 100 
pounds, like the torsion arms and wheels and the

13:57.410 --> 14:12.323
track, so we'd have to use sledgehammers to take 
the track apart, knock the pins out, And in the

14:13.568 --> 14:16.391
sand, these pins and track would wear out. So we'd 
lay the track out and replace all the pins that

14:17.371 --> 14:23.957
there was too much play in the track. Put all new 
pins in, button it back up, and check our torsion

14:25.379 --> 14:33.706
arms and everything, all our suspension system 
and overhaul in. So I was pretty muscular and

14:34.867 --> 14:43.575
everything from swinging a sledgehammer and 
maintaining these vehicles.

14:44.078 --> 14:47.083
You said that you went near the DMZ line? DMZ or DMC? 
DMZ, Demilitarized Zone. So what does that mean?

14:52.191 --> 14:54.315
Is there lots of fighting there? Well, basically 
what it was supposed to be is a border between North

14:55.337 --> 15:05.393
and South Vietnam, and no military positions or 
equipment were allowed in this area. But every

15:06.535 --> 15:09.580
once in a while, nor Vietnamese would sneak people 
across through there. It was never honored. And

15:17.728 --> 15:29.542
mainly what we did was, you know, again, river 
patrols of the rivers that were in that area.

15:29.562 --> 15:34.248
Because a river over there is like a highway here to 
us. They use it to transport stuff rather than pack

15:35.129 --> 15:40.495
their way through the jungle. We were like a 
highway patrol over

15:40.762 --> 15:46.530
there. And any ship that tried to run away from us, 
we had orders to sink it. And then we sunk quite a few

15:51.718 --> 15:55.142
boats.

15:57.946 --> 16:01.892
After a while, why were you there in the beginning, 
and why did you think you were there later on? Did

16:03.577 --> 16:05.740
you really think that that was why you were there? 
I'm trying to say, and also, did you have any, like,

16:05.760 --> 16:15.232
you were really anti-communist, and did you think 
China was helping the Vietnamese in North Vietnam

16:05.760 --> 16:15.232
at all? Yeah, I grew up with an extreme sense of 
patriotism because of, you know, my fathers had

16:16.234 --> 16:28.490
defended this country, and my grandfather in 
World War I, my father and uncles in World War II.

16:30.012 --> 16:30.833
When Kennedy... came out that he was against 
communism and they tried to attack Cuba and that he

16:32.078 --> 16:44.093
supported the operation against Cuba in the Bay of 
Pigs. And then Lee Harvey Oswald was his

16:45.474 --> 16:51.802
communists affiliation. He was, you know, spent 
some time in Russia and he assassinated Kennedy.

16:58.711 --> 16:59.031
Well, I had a deep sense against communism and the 
way, you know, Kennedy had tried to stop it. So I, at

17:11.001 --> 17:19.293
first, when I first got to Vietnam, I thought we 
were doing the right thing and trying to stop

17:11.001 --> 17:19.293
communism. But as the war dragged on and I did my 13 
months of where I came home and I saw the politics

17:20.375 --> 17:28.326
and everything, I was sorry, you know, I had ever 
participated. Because I knew we weren't going to

17:32.966 --> 17:41.555
win, and yet we had already lost thousands of lives 
and young men's lives. So I started to just want an

17:43.097 --> 17:48.623
end to it. When did you know you weren't going to 
win? I mean, when you went there, obviously you

17:50.625 --> 17:53.548
thought we were going to win, right? Yeah, right, 
back in the 60s. In the 60s, it looked good, like we

17:55.990 --> 17:58.633
were going... And then when I came home, Johnson 
was committing more and more troops. And then when

18:04.919 --> 18:15.373
I finally realized we weren't going to win was when 
Nixon took over. And then at the end of Johnson's

18:15.474 --> 18:21.682
term, you know, how he had aged. And after all the 
troops he'd committed and everything, you could

18:21.762 --> 18:28.671
tell the toll on him. And I said, no, we're not going 
to follow through and win. I figured we were just

18:33.386 --> 18:35.828
going to pull out. Did you think it was a war or a 
military assignment? No, it was a war. It was

18:40.652 --> 18:41.933
definitely a war.

18:44.896 --> 18:57.747
I know it was called a policing action, but if you 
ever saw a B-52 airstrike where sections of the

18:44.896 --> 18:57.747
jungle jump in the air and trees go flying through 
the air and You know it's a war. It is a war. What was

19:01.276 --> 19:03.699
the worst sight you had ever seen there? I mean, in 
Vietnam, what scares you the most about bad

19:03.719 --> 19:11.987
memories?

19:12.007 --> 19:22.537
I guess just the mutilated bodies and the damage 
that bullets do. I was assigned temporary duty in a

19:25.119 --> 19:27.902
prisoner of war camp. and where they kept these 
North Vietnamese, the real hardcore troops,

19:28.928 --> 19:33.353
locked up. And most of them, the only way they were 
captured was if they were shot up. This one guy had a

19:41.141 --> 19:47.028
little bullet hole here in his arm, and his whole 
elbow was missing. Another guy had his leg shot

19:48.129 --> 19:51.352
off. And when the doctor would go to look at him, 
we'd have to wash him and scrub his nub. clean it up

19:57.785 --> 20:01.811
for the doctor to look at. And then some of the 
prisoners wouldn't eat. They'd go on hunger

20:07.761 --> 20:12.308
strikes, and they would starve to death right 
there in the cells. You could just see them. As it

20:14.692 --> 20:25.108
is, they were thin people, but you could almost see 
a perfect skeleton and skull when they died from

20:14.692 --> 20:25.108
starving themselves to death. Would you say they 
had a different view of death than maybe we do? I

20:28.591 --> 20:30.072
mean, why did they do that? I guess it's their way of 
protesting their conditions, that they're

20:31.594 --> 20:41.924
intolerable to their spirit. Their will to live 
diminishes being captive. And I thought to

20:47.490 --> 20:50.353
myself, too, if I ever got captured, that I 
wouldn't live very long. I wouldn't want to live

20:54.896 --> 20:56.198
like that. Like I saw these pilots that were 
captured by the North, the way they were treated

20:57.559 --> 21:06.172
and beaten and dehumanized. I said to myself, I'll 
either make them kill me or I'll escape. And as a

21:15.045 --> 21:18.650
last resort, I'd do away with myself. But it would 
really have to be the last resort.

21:24.725 --> 21:50.023
and it was basically these living conditions and 
then like mainly we were put in charge of guarding

21:24.725 --> 21:50.023
the the vietnamese but in another stockade there 
was marine prisoners and army prisoners and every

21:24.725 --> 21:50.023
once in a while they would riot and throw try to set 
this camp on fire But only the regular MPs,

21:52.045 --> 21:58.755
military police, took care

21:52.045 --> 21:58.755
of it. Shut it off. You're talking about the 
prisoners? Yeah, and the other stockade, they had

22:04.885 --> 22:19.487
military prisoners, American soldiers that had 
done stuff, you know, crimes like, you know, rape

22:04.885 --> 22:19.487
or something like that. stealing, 
insubordination against officers. And one night

22:24.160 --> 22:38.693
they had a riot, and they would set stuff on fire and 
throw it over in the Vietnamese prisoner of war

22:24.160 --> 22:38.693
camp, trying to set it on fire. And the MPs went in 
there, and they shot the hardcore, the real

22:38.713 --> 22:47.641
hardcore leaders. And the rest of them, they kept 
them in solitary confinement. This is the

22:52.323 --> 22:55.787
captured North Vietnam? No, these were American 
soldiers that had committed crimes that were in

22:55.847 --> 23:00.432
Vietnam. Oh, OK. So they were kept near the 
prisoners of war? Yes. That way, we had machine gun

23:04.036 --> 23:15.428
towers around, and we could cover both prisons if 
they ever tried to escape or something. What did

23:16.505 --> 23:19.328
you think of those that had committed these war 
crimes, Americans? Did you think, hey, it's just

23:19.348 --> 23:22.792
something that happens in a war like this? Yeah. 
Were they guilty? Yeah, they lose their sense,

23:24.894 --> 23:33.163
their mission, and their dedication and turn to 
crime. I thought they deserved everything they

23:33.183 --> 23:43.494
got, especially the hardcore ones that were in 
solitary confinement. What were some of the worst

23:43.514 --> 23:45.516
things that they did? Well, I guess rape, murder, 
mutilation, stuff like that. That was about the

23:55.551 --> 23:58.134
worst thing you can do in a war. And some would deal 
in the black market and sell the enemy weapons and

23:59.756 --> 24:07.343
stuff. It was a little bit of everything over 
there.

24:13.750 --> 24:16.212
Did you ever, OK, this is going to sound weird, R&R, 
did you ever get that, you know, and what happened

24:16.900 --> 24:20.604
and what did you do? I got in-country R&R at a place 
that, it got real glamorous and fancy in the 70s and

24:21.265 --> 24:40.646
the late 70s, but when they first opened it up, all 
they had was a movie screen, and it's called China

24:21.265 --> 24:40.646
Beach, that movie episode. But when it first 
started up, it was just a place on the beach for, GIs

24:45.605 --> 24:47.508
to rest for three days. It's nothing like a TV 
episode. And they had a big mess hall, and they had

24:51.975 --> 25:00.588
fresh eggs, ham and eggs, breakfast, stuff like 
that. And that was it, just three days in country.

25:04.574 --> 25:07.058
No alcohol, no women there, or nothing? Well, they 
had beer. Beer was $0.10 a can. But there weren't

25:11.484 --> 25:13.387
any women there. Really? Okay,

25:14.680 --> 25:24.753
when you were in a village or whenever you 
encountered an enemy, what were the identifying

25:14.680 --> 25:24.753
marks for BC? I mean, how would you know if somebody 
was? Well, it was like saying they wore black

25:26.956 --> 25:33.504
pajamas, but that wasn't always true. But you 
could tell by the look in somebody's eyes.

25:39.439 --> 25:45.425
Especially the Orientals, some of them can say a 
lot with their eyes. They

25:46.826 --> 25:53.292
would try to avoid a direct stare by us. And then 
we'd check their IDs, because when we went on

25:53.652 --> 26:06.304
patrol in the village, that was our main goal, to 
check that everyone was properly identified and

25:53.652 --> 26:06.304
to search for weapons. But you could pretty much 
well tell by someone's actions when they were an

26:07.567 --> 26:12.552
enemy or not. And most of the time they would run 
away when they heard we were coming and hide and

26:13.793 --> 26:32.111
possibly set up an ambush for when we were coming 
back out or take pot shots as snipers when we were

26:13.793 --> 26:32.111
far enough away. When you ever found out, I mean, 
that they were there, How were they treated? I

26:38.547 --> 26:40.570
mean, were they like abused right then and there? 
If the hardcore infantry got hold of them, yeah,

26:42.372 --> 26:55.290
they would get beaten up right away, 
interrogated, and then they'd get tied up. There

26:55.310 --> 27:06.987
was this one black infantry guy that we were with, 
his name was, his nickname was Buttplate, because

26:55.310 --> 27:06.987
the M14 had him steal like flapper on the stock of 
the gun. And whenever he captured an enemy, he

27:11.629 --> 27:20.100
would beat the crap out of them with that steel 
plate, bust their heads open and everything. And

27:20.120 --> 27:24.065
they nicknamed him Butt Plate Smith, because he 
was a big old black guy. And that's why they

27:25.727 --> 27:28.710
nicknamed him. He would always butt plate 
somebody on the head. So you think that was a lot of

27:31.373 --> 27:36.720
racism or enemy feelings that made him do this, or 
what? He had seen a lot of his friends killed by the

27:37.156 --> 27:43.865
Viet Cong and he hated all Orientals. Understand? 
He'd even have trouble with the Koreans that were

27:46.369 --> 27:56.042
fighting alongside of him. Yeah, basically it was 
like reverse prejudice that he was taking out. How

28:02.230 --> 28:04.193
would you compare the Koreans to Arvin? The 
Koreans were the fiercest fighters. They were

28:07.993 --> 28:15.164
always ready to do hand-to-hand combat, always 
practicing, even on each other. Early in the

28:15.224 --> 28:20.272
morning before breakfast, they'd do martial 
arts. And they were real fierce fighters. Like I

28:24.038 --> 28:29.727
told you earlier, they would torture anybody, 
men, women, old people. They didn't care. Torture

28:32.431 --> 28:33.673
them and mutilate them. Did you ever experience 
any racism there? Yeah, a couple of times. Like

28:43.031 --> 28:45.493
what? Well, I was one of the few, there was only 
about three of us Hispanics in the company I was in.

28:55.482 --> 29:02.428
And some of the harder core white guys were, you 
could tell they were prejudiced. They'd make

29:02.448 --> 29:04.690
remarks, they called us greasers. But

29:05.733 --> 29:10.777
most of them accepted us. What surprised me was 
some of them from Tennessee, because they were

29:10.877 --> 29:23.468
real hardcore, prejudiced people in those days, 
were from North Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia,

29:10.877 --> 29:23.468
Alabama, Mobile.

29:27.071 --> 29:29.833
But once you got out in the... This was, you know, 
the worst thing to be is in Garrison or in the

29:29.853 --> 29:35.638
company area. Because the guys get on each other's 
nerves. You go to the club and drink, and then your

29:40.271 --> 29:47.483
basic prejudices come out. You start taking your 
nerves out on each other. But most of the time, this

29:50.347 --> 29:55.315
is another reason why I didn't need any R&Rs. We 
were always on the move in our vehicles, amphibs,

29:55.355 --> 30:03.128
constantly patrolling, always on the move. Then 
some, this one infantry area we were in, the black

30:04.593 --> 30:15.646
guys, were real prejudice against any kind of 
Hispanics or white people. And they had their own

30:16.687 --> 30:17.808
group. It was a bunch of black infantry guys. And 
they had set up a boxing ring. And they would

30:23.374 --> 30:27.860
challenge the white guys and anybody they could to 
get in that ring room. Did you ever do that? No, I

30:29.862 --> 30:33.566
came close to it. But... I'd just tell him, hey, go 
out there and get Charlie and beat the shit out of

30:34.613 --> 30:41.883
him for taking your prejudice out on us, you know? 
Do you think that was really strange? I mean, when

30:44.226 --> 30:51.596
you all are supposed to be fighting together and 
then this racist guy... Yeah, yeah, but like I

30:44.226 --> 30:51.596
said, people are capable of anything. You'd be 
surprised what you find people doing.

31:01.069 --> 31:02.511
When you found out... When you had to go home, how 
did you feel? I mean, how were you? Well, I felt

31:08.078 --> 31:23.833
happy and nervous and like they were probably 
going to extend all of us to stay over there or some

31:08.078 --> 31:23.833
way to shaft us, well, me. And you were constantly 
on guard waiting to get shot or something. I was

31:29.718 --> 31:31.840
lucky I never did get hurt over there. But you get 
all kinds of mixed feelings. You're worried about

31:38.355 --> 31:43.280
the long flight home, something's going to go 
wrong with a plane. Just a thousand things go

31:44.222 --> 31:48.386
through your head. Did it never happen in your mind 
that, hey, I want to stay for another tour, come

31:48.406 --> 31:54.473
back for another tour or anything like that? No, 
not after what I'd seen. And... I just had my fill of

32:01.047 --> 32:03.411
the war. And then the politics involved, too. And 
then, you know, watching guys go crazy,

32:10.321 --> 32:28.708
especially when we came home and we didn't know 
what was happening to some of the guys, what they

32:10.321 --> 32:28.708
were going through, post-traumatic shock 
syndrome or whatever it's called. I saw a lot of

32:30.089 --> 32:32.732
guys go bananas there at Camp Pendleton. This one 
guy,

32:32.752 --> 32:48.209
I happened to be the duty NCO that night, and he just 
came to the front of the building and just started

32:32.752 --> 32:48.209
breaking all the windows with his bare hands. And 
he was all cut up and bleeding. That was when you

32:52.254 --> 32:53.775
returned home? Yeah. I guess that something just 
snapped in his head. He was all cut up and bleeding,

33:00.683 --> 33:04.007
and I had to call the... I was in charge of the banks, 
and I had to call the medical people out there to

33:04.027 --> 33:14.000
come help him before he bled to death. And then 
another guy borrowed this other guy's car, and

33:15.462 --> 33:30.100
when he was driving off the base, he just ran right 
through the gate real fast, and the MPs fired at him

33:15.462 --> 33:30.100
and chased him into town, and ended up... He was 
lucky they didn't kill him. They just wounded him

33:31.792 --> 33:33.674
and arrested him. But a lot of guys that went 
bananas. Is there anything, do you feel like you

33:39.920 --> 33:42.422
changed in any way? Yeah, I just have a real serious 
attitude.

33:53.592 --> 33:57.055
It's hard for me to laugh and ease up. And mainly I'm 
just devoted to my job. When you came home, I always

34:00.590 --> 34:15.224
hear stories about, oh, they always gave ticket, 
whatever, whatever, parades for the other world,

34:00.590 --> 34:15.224
for the other wars, and for Vietnam, they didn't 
care. Is that the impression you got from the other

34:15.244 --> 34:18.547
people here in the United States? Yeah, well, I try 
to figure things out for myself. And, you know,

34:24.093 --> 34:29.618
like World War II had a definite end, and... all the 
troops were coming home, to me, there never will be

34:30.307 --> 34:38.514
a definite end to Vietnam. Because the way I see it, 
sooner or later, we're going to have to go back

34:38.534 --> 34:42.758
there. Why? Different things, like the 
Orientals, to me, like remember what happened

34:44.939 --> 34:54.247
with Japan now? You know, when we dropped the bomb 
on them, we thought we had destroyed them.

35:00.007 --> 35:01.629
completely annihilated them. Now they've 
started like an economic war. They're out selling

35:06.215 --> 35:12.403
us and they're better off than we are now. 
Eventually I think this will lead to an overall

35:14.366 --> 35:22.116
clash between the United States and Japan.

35:24.339 --> 35:27.583
To me, as long as there's different races, there's 
going to be conflicts like what's going on in South

35:28.238 --> 35:30.360
America. It's a jungle terrain like Vietnam was. 
So we have to send troops in there. I've heard some

35:37.869 --> 35:47.079
remarks that those guerrillas in South America 
say this will be a worse war than Vietnam. So

35:47.099 --> 35:53.626
there'll always be another Vietnam, or it'll 
never end. Did anybody ever make you feel ashamed

35:54.827 --> 35:57.570
that you had been in Vietnam? No. No, I never got the 
kind of... Some guys said they got spat on and

36:05.068 --> 36:11.473
remarks called baby killers and all that, but I 
never did. And even if they did say that to my face,

36:11.513 --> 36:20.241
it wouldn't hurt me because I know what kind of 
service I did over there. And like I said, I think I

36:20.281 --> 36:27.827
did 50% to help the people and the other 50% to hurt 
the enemy. So I have a great sense of

36:28.634 --> 36:35.223
accomplishment in my service in Vietnam. What did 
you think about anti-war protests, burning up the

36:35.924 --> 36:41.692
draft cards? Well, I believe in freedom of speech, 
and that's another thing I went into the military

36:41.712 --> 36:49.523
to defend. People have a right to express their 
opinions Whatever way, shape, or form, it doesn't

36:56.630 --> 37:00.255
hurt someone else. So, it doesn't bother me. Why do 
you think we lost FINA? Because the politicians

37:09.448 --> 37:18.401
were afraid that if we invaded the North, it would 
escalate into war with China and Russia. I think

37:18.421 --> 37:23.768
our politicians were basically afraid they would 
start World War III. and it would be against the

37:25.115 --> 37:28.219
yellow man. That's the main thing I think our 
president, our politicians were afraid

37:30.723 --> 37:39.675
of. Now they have all these Vietnam memorials and 
whatnot. What do you think of those things? I think

37:46.163 --> 37:53.333
it's good, but most of it, doesn't really to me come 
from the people because like the Vietnam memorial

37:54.646 --> 38:21.227
here in San Antonio it's paid being paid for by the 
veterans themselves so to me these memorials have

37:54.646 --> 38:21.227
a hollow empty thing about them and then the the 
main Vietnam memorial um Again, you know, I think

38:23.384 --> 38:34.978
it's great for the guys that died and, you know, 
their names are on it, but my name isn't on it. And

38:35.539 --> 38:39.423
it'll, you know, it'll never be on there. But I 
think it's great, like I said, for the dead to

38:39.443 --> 38:48.174
remember them. Each individual with his name on 
that wall. But it doesn't... really affect

38:54.282 --> 38:59.669
me. Vietnam, is that something you really want 
people to know about? Because I know in grade

39:02.092 --> 39:05.076
school and high school, I never learned anything 
about it. I'm just really learning about it now. I

39:06.798 --> 39:21.556
think the only way I deal with the stress I feel from 
having been over there is to educate myself about

39:06.798 --> 39:21.556
it, exactly what happened. And every once in a 
while, I'll I'll rent a videotape about the 10,000

39:23.408 --> 39:26.811
Day War. That's a series of videotapes that tells 
you exactly why, what happened, what decisions

39:27.672 --> 39:53.398
our president made, and how Ho Chi Minh met with his

39:27.672 --> 39:53.398
leaders and turned around and overturned the 
plans of the United States so that he could free his

39:27.672 --> 39:53.398
people would unite, you know, because it was 
basically a civil war like our civil war, the north

39:54.053 --> 40:00.501
against the south. The south didn't want to go 
along with the north, so the north started sending

40:02.123 --> 40:20.085
troops to kill or overthrow the regime and bring 
the people back under its control. So I felt like we

40:23.973 --> 40:28.659
were meddling in affairs that weren't any of our 
business. But like I said, I had a tremendous sense

40:28.759 --> 40:36.508
to try and stop communism. I grew up worshiping 
President Kennedy. And when someone affiliated

40:40.933 --> 40:53.288
with a communist party killed him, I kind of had a 
bitter pill against communism.

40:55.664 --> 40:58.087
How about Nixon in Cambodia? Well, I think he did 
what his military advisors told him. You know,

41:08.959 --> 41:11.622
hey, we're taking a beating. These guys are 
running a couple of miles into Cambodia and

41:12.102 --> 41:17.008
laughing at us. It's back to the old cat and mouse 
routine.

41:24.622 --> 41:31.793
Nixon turned loose the troops to go and do away with 
that harassment they were getting. So that was

41:33.075 --> 41:34.437
justified? I think it was, yeah. I'm going to wind 
down. Just how have your feelings changed over

41:39.766 --> 41:45.455
time about the war? Well, like I was saying 
earlier,

41:51.824 --> 41:57.552
I've studied it and the decisions that were made 
and it was the politicians that blew it. And I don't

41:58.633 --> 42:01.057
feel bad about it. It doesn't bother me. That's how 
I've overcome my stress and stuff. I know exactly

42:05.683 --> 42:07.866
what happened. I've educated myself to know what 
happened and who made what decisions and what

42:07.886 --> 42:17.359
brought them to that point. What do you think about 
these movies like Platoon and, you know,

42:18.436 --> 42:22.662
Apocalypse Now? Do you think that they really give 
an accurate portrayal or they're glossing it

42:22.702 --> 42:27.790
over? I don't think Apocalypse Now, I think that 
more is a comedy, you know, like a satire. To me,

42:39.246 --> 42:47.278
that's what... Platoon, I think it was real 
accurate as to what happened to the army over

42:39.246 --> 42:47.278
there. It was a pretty good movie to show the young 
man what war was like in that era, in that time. But

43:03.404 --> 43:15.696
man is always improving and changing his weapons 
and his tactics, so I think the next war will be even

43:03.404 --> 43:15.696
more deadly. because we're getting to the point 
where most of our weapons are push-button and

43:16.148 --> 43:26.123
there's nothing personal involved, you know. 
It's real, more like computer games.

43:35.497 --> 43:45.852
I think that these movies show what war was like 
then, but for everyone, future generations, it's

43:35.497 --> 43:45.852
going to be different. I'm done asking questions. 
If you have any comments that you want to make sure

43:48.571 --> 43:53.277
that maybe I understand, that's fine. If not, 
that's okay. No, I just, you know, I had, you asked

43:55.459 --> 44:04.811
me earlier if I did want to go back to Vietnam. You 
know, when I, like I said, I was over there in the

44:05.151 --> 44:14.622
early 60s and it was kind of crude at first. I think 
in the If I had gone back again in the 70s, because I

44:16.308 --> 44:34.506
came back in 67, all

44:16.308 --> 44:34.506
you had to do was spend 90 days here in the United 
States, and then the Marines usually would send

44:16.308 --> 44:34.506
you back for a second tour. And I just decided that 
I'd had enough, and I wasn't going to stay in the

44:36.028 --> 44:46.078
Marines because 90 days later I'd end up back in 
Vietnam. Because I had a critical MOS, armored

44:47.206 --> 44:53.917
personnel carriers were critical MOS. And I knew 
I'd end up right back again if I reenlisted, so I got

44:55.940 --> 45:05.476
out.

45:05.777 --> 45:07.600
That's about all I have to say. Okay, thanks.
