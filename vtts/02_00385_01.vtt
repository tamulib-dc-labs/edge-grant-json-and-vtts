WEBVTT

00:02.427 --> 00:03.748
There are some rolls here, by the way. Oh, no, 
thanks. There's a go. And when I did, I never

00:08.793 --> 00:15.740
cooked, so I wasn't using the kitchen in my 
apartment. So I just made the kitchen into an

00:15.760 --> 00:17.321
office. But it's adequate for me, but it isn't much 
of a place to entertain anybody. Yeah, I

00:22.086 --> 00:23.427
understand that. That's why I suggested coming 
down here. This is fine. It's not any problem,

00:26.250 --> 00:28.232
really.

00:30.068 --> 00:33.233
Now, after the plant closes down, then what do you 
do? Where do you go from there? You stay with Bureau

00:36.137 --> 00:37.238
of Mines? Well, I was already here. At the time, I 
was in charge of engineering here. So I was just on a

00:44.829 --> 00:54.523
leave of absence to the State Department for this 
Pakistan plant, mainly because it was a coal

00:44.829 --> 00:54.523
plant.

00:56.461 --> 01:03.451
required oxygen and required low-temperature 
liquefaction, both of which, again, are

00:56.461 --> 01:03.451
compression processes. So I came back here. Some 
of the people from out there stayed on. Most of them

01:11.482 --> 01:12.904
got out of their jobs. They were pretty much in 
demand, really. And it was back in the days when

01:15.368 --> 01:17.711
government salaries weren't too good. Well, see, 
Cattell left for a couple years, and then he came

01:20.095 --> 01:24.561
back. His job was primarily on costing. He set up a 
cost group here. And he retired about a little over

01:32.838 --> 01:38.686
a year ago.

01:41.430 --> 01:50.683
So of the group out there, there's, I

01:41.430 --> 01:50.683
don't know of any, but everybody's gone.

01:54.578 --> 01:57.703
A couple of them came back and worked at the 
anthracite station, but they're gone. Kenny and

01:58.263 --> 01:59.245
Bircher. But they're both retired.

02:12.024 --> 02:12.905
Mr. Wainwright? Wainwright was never out there. I 
see. He was here. I see. He just retired this year.

02:24.987 --> 02:29.792
He had a gas purification program here. In fact, 
the gas purification that we used on the

02:29.812 --> 02:44.667
Fisher-Tropsch plant out there was pretty much 
what they had developed here, and it worked okay.

02:44.687 --> 02:47.350
I was the resident engineer on the Fisher-Tropsch 
plant. It was a copper project, and it was designed

02:47.370 --> 02:51.814
in Pittsburgh. Copper didn't move engineering in 
like Bexhill did. They wanted somebody to go out.

02:58.196 --> 03:03.281
So again, being single, I spent a better part of a 
year out here. And then toward the end, we were

03:03.541 --> 03:06.464
starting up the plant. So then Cattell come out and 
finished up the job. But my job was primarily

03:10.007 --> 03:15.533
buying equipment for the Fisher-Groves plant. 
And since it was all of the compressors and a lot of

03:17.314 --> 03:23.260
the pumps were on steam, So that was one reason they 
wanted me to come back here on account of my

03:25.400 --> 03:37.611
esteemed background.

03:37.631 --> 03:39.853
Why the cost studies on the plan, I wonder? Why? Why 
the cost studies on the plan? Well, the idea of

03:41.975 --> 03:55.086
making the—all of our work, we always tried to 
extrapolate to see whether—I mean, the only way

03:41.975 --> 03:55.086
that you can direct research is to look out ahead 
and see where you're going. And I mean, if you've

03:58.854 --> 04:10.726
got something that works the best thing in the 
world and you find out that, one, you can't scale it

03:58.854 --> 04:10.726
up, or two, if you do scale it up, it's going to be so 
expensive nobody will ever want it, you better get

03:58.854 --> 04:10.726
into some other type of research. And that's, in 
effect, what happened. Well, yeah, it was pretty

04:15.111 --> 04:18.534
obvious. Well, two things happened. One, there 
were two different plants. it was pretty obvious

04:22.201 --> 04:26.427
that the coal hydro plant, the pressure was just 
plain too high. And on the Fisher Toast plant, that

04:28.530 --> 04:34.058
was already being picked up. Keith built a plant, 
which never operated for very long, down in

04:35.299 --> 04:41.328
Brownsville, Texas, Fisher Toast plant. And then 
the next step was that they built these big ones in

04:42.029 --> 04:45.133
South Africa. So actually, all of the gasoline and 
oil that's been built by— made from coal

04:50.348 --> 04:57.682
synthetically has all been made after the war was 
all by Fischer-Tropsch. Which never worked well

04:57.702 --> 05:00.708
for the Germans. Well, see, there was a reason for 
it, and that was that the Germans, this was back in

05:00.728 --> 05:10.667
the propeller plane days, and the thing that the 
Germans wanted was very high octane. And the coal

05:11.809 --> 05:13.572
hydro made it. So see, all their aviation gasoline 
was made of coal hydro. And the Fisher-Tropes in

05:17.838 --> 05:23.105
those days, and still does as far as that goes, 
makes a wide spectrum. With the coal hydro, you can

05:23.125 --> 05:25.408
pretty much tailor it. But with the 
Fisher-Tropes, you make a wide spectrum. And they

05:29.815 --> 05:30.816
made everything. They made alcohol, and they made 
butter, and they made gasoline.

05:36.905 --> 05:43.474
But most of their synthetics were made from coal 
hydro rather than FT. The big advantage of FT was,

05:45.445 --> 05:49.330
of course, the pressure. You can go out and buy the 
equipment off the shelf. Did you ever run into

05:53.034 --> 05:59.822
problems with IG Farben, conflict of patents or 
conflicts of... If they did, I know nothing about

05:59.842 --> 06:01.264
it. As far as I know now, I think we just adopted the 
attitude that we wanted to order.

06:08.712 --> 06:10.154
That's my impression. Of course, I was over there 
afterward. In fact, I even spent some time with IG

06:12.677 --> 06:15.300
Farben. One of the things I was interested in on 
this Pakistan job was utilizing the Winkler

06:15.533 --> 06:21.720
gasifiers rather than the Lergy's, since the 
Lergy's made a lot of methane. I didn't

06:22.120 --> 06:30.649
particularly want the methane, but I found out 
that the—everything was pretty much cut and

06:22.120 --> 06:30.649
dried, so we ended up with Lergy's. But I did spend 
some time at the—well, this was—actually, I said

06:30.709 --> 06:36.235
IG Farben. Actually, it wasn't. It was the BASF at 
Ludwigshaben. And I knew Dr. Flesch in those days,

06:40.059 --> 06:43.363
and he'd very much like to put in some But 
unfortunately, we ended up—that was the only

06:44.322 --> 06:51.429
Mooney plant I know that ever used Lurgies. Did you 
use any other variations, like Schmalfeld?

06:54.572 --> 06:57.214
Schmalfeld was never very practical. In fact, we 
did some work here with an offshoot of it, in which

06:57.675 --> 07:08.946
we—of course, the idea of the Schmalfeld was that 
you recycled hot gases.

07:08.966 --> 07:13.350
We always found that no matter what we did, we still 
had to use oxygen, so we cut it out. And, of course,

07:14.782 --> 07:22.913
it didn't come on in a new dress under Penn Income, 
but it was new. The gasification processes that

07:22.933 --> 07:31.264
were really practical in Germany were the clergy 
for town gas in the winter for synthetic fuels.

07:33.106 --> 07:34.208
Copper's toxic came along. In fact, we had copper. 
In fact, we had toxic out at Louisiana and

07:35.349 --> 07:38.053
Missouri. We had a copper's toxic gas fire out 
there, but the thing never worked because he

07:38.533 --> 07:43.540
insisted on bringing the the coal in with the 
oxygen, and it was always blowing up and catching

07:44.144 --> 07:48.029
on fire. So we finally got rid of it. But since that 
time, it's become a viable process. And I guess

07:54.376 --> 08:00.984
most of the ammonia around the world that's made 
from coal has been made with copper's toxic. And I

08:01.705 --> 08:09.915
understand that the ERDA is just going to contract 
to, I guess, the coppers for a copper's toxic for a

08:01.705 --> 08:09.915
hydrogen plant. Where do you pull such vast 
amounts of hydrogen from? Where? Where do you pull

08:15.136 --> 08:16.077
that from? You always get it from water. I see. 
That's the name of it. You know, washer stuff. Yes,

08:20.765 --> 08:23.830
that's right. Always comes from water. What you 
do, you trade carbon for hydrogen if you're going

08:25.693 --> 08:31.382
all the way with coal.

08:34.366 --> 08:38.653
In fact, hydrogen gave Germany, without their 
hydrogen technology, Germany couldn't have

08:34.366 --> 08:38.653
fought either world war.

08:42.413 --> 08:45.297
So you end up with what, CO, just CO gas? Well, you 
make CO and hydrogen and then use the water gas

08:45.437 --> 08:52.065
shift to shift the CO to hydrogen and CO2 and wash 
out the CO2.

09:04.480 --> 09:05.401
Any more questions?

09:10.027 --> 09:11.188
Did you inquire what's I wanted to continue that. 
Now, after, let's say now, we're talking about

09:14.842 --> 09:20.212
1952, right? Is that about when you leave the 
plant? We shut down the plant in 1952. I left in 1952

09:24.780 --> 09:27.966
to go overseas. The plant was shut down July 1, 
1953, and I'm still over there. I came back in

09:32.734 --> 09:35.179
September of that year. And then what do you do? 
Then you come back to work here? I came back to work

09:38.572 --> 09:41.277
here and finished up the plant here. Okay. And then 
we moved out there in 1954. Yeah. So I was still

09:46.345 --> 09:50.412
working on the engineering and construction of 
this plant when I came back. And then you consult

09:50.932 --> 09:53.757
for private industry then? Then? No, I couldn't. I 
worked for the Bureau. So you don't begin to

09:57.663 --> 10:00.448
consult for Diamond Shamrock then until after? I 
never consulted for Diamond Shamrock. I just

10:01.830 --> 10:03.012
happened to be interested in their Oh, OK. And the 
fact that they've got a plant here. And I've always

10:06.276 --> 10:10.761
been interested in these metallurgical 
processes. And the thing I found out was that they

10:11.461 --> 10:18.489
were having, I understand, having some trouble 
getting natural gas. And I thought that there was

10:18.549 --> 10:27.378
some talk, and again, this is forehand, that they 
might move the whole operation over here at

10:18.549 --> 10:27.378
Kingwood. And I was interested in that, if indeed I 
could help. That's the two-stage hydrogenation.

10:33.012 --> 10:39.500
I'm not really too sure about it, exactly how they 
do it. I think the hydrogenation work was done over

10:40.141 --> 10:50.654
in Maryland, and then the product was shipped 
here, and I think it was an electric furnace the

10:40.141 --> 10:50.654
rest of the way, but I'm not 100 percent sure. The 
only thing I'm interested in, what was

10:52.997 --> 10:59.745
interesting, was making hydrogen from coal 
natural gas. I worked for the guy that developed

11:01.223 --> 11:04.307
the natural gas reforming, Shapley.

11:07.571 --> 11:10.234
But now it's—we've got to go the other way. See, 
that's one of the things. All these plants that

11:12.437 --> 11:19.626
have been built, nobody has ever faced up to making 
the hydrogen. Louisiana, Missouri, we got it from

11:19.646 --> 11:24.372
our—we call them cracking furnaces. They call 
them reformers now. And then all these other

11:26.735 --> 11:30.019
plants have been built. solvent-refined coal, 
and high gas, and all of them, they've always

11:30.640 --> 11:42.395
gotten the hydrogen from reforming natural gas, 
because it's an easy way to do it. So nobody's

11:42.415 --> 11:46.460
really faced up to it. Is this the high gas process 
that started IGT? Yeah, that's right. They've

11:50.304 --> 11:52.087
gotten away from the hydrogenation now. It's 
pretty much an oxygen process, pretty much like

11:52.107 --> 11:56.412
xanthine, really.

12:01.319 --> 12:05.763
For

12:01.319 --> 12:05.763
whom do you consult? For whom do you consult? Just 
anybody. Primarily mechanical technology. And

12:15.133 --> 12:19.918
then I also consult for two groups for Gilbert. And 
then I consult for Rocketdyne

12:21.719 --> 12:27.585
and Argonne Lab. But, you know, it's one of these 
things. I just work when they want me to. I work, I

12:34.444 --> 12:37.708
guess, about seventy days a year. And then put 
another thirty. Another thirty, huh? That's a

12:40.892 --> 12:41.814
nice job. And then another thirty. Well, see, I had 
thirty-three years in the government at a fairly

12:43.616 --> 12:51.006
high grade. It actually wouldn't pay me to work for 
the government anymore. I could make about as much

12:53.349 --> 12:55.512
as I retired as I could work. That's many years. I 
just do this as a hobby, really. I could probably

13:02.626 --> 13:06.078
I've never looked for somebody who wants me fined. 
In fact, amazingly, last year, an awful lot of my

13:06.098 --> 13:11.337
work has been MHD.
