WEBVTT

00:08.333 --> 00:11.116
the impact that your father was a Democrat have 
any? Did that have any impact on you? What's your

00:14.459 --> 00:16.741
political perception? I'm a Republican. I'm a 
conservative. Were you? How did you come to become

00:21.406 --> 00:30.475
a conservative Republican?

00:30.495 --> 00:37.682
I guess

00:30.495 --> 00:37.682
my first conscientious national

00:39.620 --> 00:52.292
effort, political national effort was in the 
election of Eisenhower and it was probably drawn

00:39.620 --> 00:52.292
through military. I

00:52.533 --> 01:08.108
can't say that that was true state and local 
because in Texas at that time we were still a single

01:08.898 --> 01:11.082
party system. I happen to be,

01:12.364 --> 01:27.309
I don't know whether we're jumping or trying to 
follow a plan, but I happen to be the co-editor of

01:12.364 --> 01:27.309
the battalion after the war. I went back to finish 
my degree. I was not degreed before the war, I was

01:30.614 --> 01:32.998
just commissioned.

01:43.154 --> 01:45.298
Anything you want published, bring it to me. Let me 
know. We're going to get you elected. And we

01:49.165 --> 01:58.563
elected Tiger T.

01:49.165 --> 01:58.563
You'd never say that he was conservative or 
Republican. No. He'd spin in his grave.

02:03.432 --> 02:06.698
So you became a Republican during the 50s.

02:10.660 --> 02:18.672
which you became more conservative during the 
50s, I don't know what you say, politically? Yeah,

02:18.692 --> 02:20.094
I'd say that's right. And then during the 60s, did 
you vote for Goldwater or for Johnson? Goldwater.

02:26.182 --> 02:30.949
Goldwater, and then you've been what you consider 
a conservative Republican ever since? Yep. Okay.

02:34.635 --> 02:34.955
Now... Without apology. I'm not asking for an 
apology. Laying right down there on the couch with

02:42.132 --> 02:44.936
no apologies. Have you read it? No. No, I haven't. 
Oh, . No matter what your political .

03:24.607 --> 03:34.921
about where you lived, your accommodations,

03:24.607 --> 03:34.921
and the core outfit that you were in. Okay.

03:38.666 --> 03:49.842
The first half of my freshman year,

03:38.666 --> 03:49.842
I lived in Ms. Yule's boarding house in downtown 
Bryan. You know Ms. Yule? I've heard about that.

03:54.779 --> 04:01.207
two lovely twins, daughters.

04:05.032 --> 04:16.888
There were, oh, I guess six or eight of us cadets 
living in the house plus three or four

04:39.211 --> 04:53.234
The courthouse grounds, and it is the block where 
the courthouse is now, became our

04:39.211 --> 04:53.234
predominant recreation grounds. We played touch 
football. We played everything imaginable out

04:54.636 --> 05:01.607
there on the grounds because that wasn't the only 
rooming house or boarding house.

05:09.485 --> 05:11.227
were. Then I went into

05:11.247 --> 05:34.092
second headquarters battery

05:11.247 --> 05:34.092
mid freshman year and the battery was located in 
Milner,

05:11.247 --> 05:34.092
but we had three rooms in Ross.

05:39.691 --> 05:50.521
and I lived in room 2 Ross and room 2 Ross was right on 
the end and that's the south end on the ground

05:39.691 --> 05:50.521
floor.

05:53.904 --> 06:09.259
It was the ideal room to have because we had it 
rigged where all we had to do was just touch the

05:53.904 --> 06:09.259
screen like that and it would fall and when the 
upperclassmen hit that front door on an air out all

05:53.904 --> 06:09.259
we did was touch that screen and long past Sully 
headed south before they ever got to the door of our

06:10.066 --> 06:26.591
room, but that was better than living on the top 
floor of Milner, except the fact that we were

06:10.066 --> 06:26.591
separated from the main part of the battery.

06:31.619 --> 06:38.790
I was rumored to

06:31.619 --> 06:38.790
call my name Colson. five-year student he lived 
over at

07:19.439 --> 07:23.367
second half of freshman year, all the sophomore 
year. And then the next year they open, they still

07:24.670 --> 07:29.339
call it the new dorm. And they farm more units. And 
how they decided who was going to

07:52.396 --> 08:01.848
My

07:52.396 --> 08:01.848
sophomore year, I managed to get around the 
miller. What was your opinion of

08:01.868 --> 08:07.636
pacing? I don't really have an opinion of it. You 
either accepted it or you weren't there, you know.

08:18.510 --> 08:19.551
Did you accept it?

08:28.120 --> 08:46.677
And they can pour one hell of a day into one day that a 
lot of people went through a whole year and never

08:28.120 --> 08:46.677
got as much as we got the one day of initiation into 
the cross-border period, which was nothing

08:28.120 --> 08:46.677
except physical mayhem and hatred. Admin. Oh. I 
got pictures that even my wife wouldn't look at.

08:54.684 --> 08:54.844
Hurley. Oh, yeah. Listers. Oh, yeah. Blue, black 
and blue.

09:03.897 --> 09:05.359
Did you see a purpose in that? At that time, no. I 
can't see a purpose in it now either.

09:14.672 --> 09:24.486
I don't, you know, talking to other people, I guess 
it's like I said, it was a

09:29.140 --> 09:39.230
The sign of the times is not really a good 
description, but it wasn't at Texas A&M only. I

09:39.250 --> 09:43.734
have a friend that lives two blocks over here right 
now. He's at a fraternity reunion at Oklahoma

09:43.794 --> 09:48.819
State right now.

09:52.162 --> 09:55.165
Just before he left, he said, boy, I wish I could 
find my boy.

10:02.249 --> 10:13.088
I imagine

10:02.249 --> 10:13.088
Westmoreland and Annapolis was just as equal, 
maybe worse, never having been through this. I

10:13.268 --> 10:17.676
don't know.

10:34.480 --> 10:35.621
I'm sure people have been. Did you ever have a 
position of leadership when you were in the Corps?

10:52.799 --> 11:03.711
That's a question that can be answered in a

10:52.799 --> 11:03.711
different way. One would all but have to define 
leadership.

11:13.428 --> 11:23.819
The second headquarters, Field Artillery,

11:13.428 --> 11:23.819
was a horse-drawn Field Artillery unit. We still 
had a horse, a dowry and a field artillery boat.

11:40.057 --> 11:47.945
the nuclear body of the so-called enlisted men and 
the juniors at that time made up the sergeants and

11:40.057 --> 11:47.945
the seniors were the cadets.

11:52.830 --> 12:07.566
On a three-team hookup

11:52.830 --> 12:07.566
of pulling either a cannon or an ammunition 
limber,

11:52.830 --> 12:07.566
the rider of the wheel team is the leader.

12:13.769 --> 12:25.748
And he tells the lead team and the swing team when to 
bear into the traces and when to let up and so on to

12:13.769 --> 12:25.748
make that thing run smooth.

12:27.511 --> 12:34.903
If that is one's definition of a leader, hell yes.

12:40.908 --> 13:09.092
but uh that's that's just in the softwoods and then 
the junior year when

12:40.908 --> 13:09.092
when they made these new batteries and we moved 
into the new dormitories

12:40.908 --> 13:09.092
i went into h battery and became a four striper all 
the other juniors are either our three stripers

13:09.342 --> 13:16.532
and left their own battalion corps staff, except 
the first sergeant. The first sergeant and a four

13:16.552 --> 13:19.135
striper in each battery. And I was a four striper. 
And our first sergeant was

13:23.320 --> 13:32.232
a table waiter. And so it fell on my lot to fall in the 
battery, to farm the battery, at each of the meals

13:38.890 --> 13:42.413
before going into it. Now, to make it even worse,

13:42.433 --> 13:53.043
boy, if we don't learn anything from history, how 
will we learn this one? This first sergeant was a

13:53.063 --> 14:06.315
freshman first sergeant, not a freshman, a fish 
first sergeant, meaning his first year on campus.

14:06.785 --> 14:14.514
And he wore, I don't know what he was wearing, a 
little white stripe around his sleeve, but he wore

14:06.785 --> 14:14.514
First Sergeant stripes. And therefore, he had no 
recognition. He was a fish to everybody, just like

14:18.017 --> 14:23.023
he was a first-year student. He was a transfer from 
Louisiana into the veterinary medicine school.

14:29.310 --> 14:35.897
So both being in the veterinary medicine business 
and a table waiter took him completely out of our

14:29.310 --> 14:35.897
battery. unofficially, and left me as the titular 
first sergeant of the Battery because I was the

14:36.029 --> 14:45.200
force driver. Well, unfortunately, there's good 
news and bad news. I did not scholastically

14:51.667 --> 15:02.880
qualify as a senior, and they learned their 
mistake, and they put him on a battalion staff

14:51.667 --> 15:02.880
rather than making the Battery commander the next

15:10.572 --> 15:13.796
from the outside to take the battery my senior 
year. A guy from Beaumont. He was a damn good, you

15:15.578 --> 15:19.342
know, good classmate, a good battery commander 
and all that. But, yeah, I found myself in a number

15:19.363 --> 15:32.959
of positions, both military as well as on the 
battalion, you know, of responsibility.

15:39.487 --> 15:39.887
Again,

15:47.748 --> 15:57.857
My interpretation or definition of leadership 
gets into management a whole lot quicker than some

15:47.748 --> 15:57.857
people. Well, we'll talk about that. Let's talk 
now about the Corps itself. What were some of the

16:02.401 --> 16:08.186
things that you liked about being in the Corps?

16:08.206 --> 16:09.567
Did you enjoy the Corps? Oh, yes. Well, why? What 
were some of those things

16:11.389 --> 16:16.573
that you liked?

16:19.743 --> 16:40.744
It provided a quasi-military atmosphere without 
actually

16:19.743 --> 16:40.744
committing a person to being in the Army or the 
Marine or the Navy. You didn't have an Air Force at

16:41.625 --> 16:46.830
that time. It certainly gave one the opportunity 
to develop

16:48.818 --> 17:18.201
friendship quicker and friendships that would 
probably last longer than

16:48.818 --> 17:18.201
just living in a dormitory next door to a couple of 
guys that you may know and you may not know because

16:48.818 --> 17:18.201
it was forced upon you to to know them to know their 
background and know something about them to be

17:18.788 --> 17:38.148
able to recite all who these people were 
constantly try to meet more people and more people

17:18.788 --> 17:38.148
and more people. Like a camaraderie. That's a good 
point. As

17:41.372 --> 17:46.197
long as it's not overused.

17:50.125 --> 18:00.418
like years later when I was up there as an 
instructor, there were three of us walking along

17:50.125 --> 18:00.418
in front of the Student Union, and here came a young 
freshman. Oh, and he slew him three times and says,

18:00.438 --> 18:04.403
howdy, howdy, howdy, sir, sir, sir. I

18:05.104 --> 18:18.040
think it can be overdone, and when it is, it's... 
still the day to meet with the form of aging.

18:26.448 --> 18:46.828
When it's done in sincerity, and when whoever's 
pushing the button is doing it, knowing that

18:26.448 --> 18:46.828
there's a degree of having a pullback or

18:26.448 --> 18:46.828
the person's entitled to a certain amount of

18:55.617 --> 19:15.752
I guess

18:55.617 --> 19:15.752
the further you get away from it,

19:25.452 --> 19:32.921
And then you come back and say, yeah, this is what

19:25.452 --> 19:32.921
it was. Were there any things about the choir that 
you disliked? That I disliked?

19:57.565 --> 20:00.349
Well, I guess at the time there were. And

20:00.830 --> 20:13.290
yet as one

20:00.830 --> 20:13.290
moved up to himself and realized it was necessary. 
My freshman year, for instance, I would dislike

20:14.893 --> 20:24.568
being told that you've got to go play in an 
intramural game when you do that because, well,

20:14.893 --> 20:24.568
let's you know, that you had no skill in it, but then 
later on you realize that, gee, if we hadn't been

20:25.223 --> 20:41.945
there, we'd have farfetched it, and that's the 
worst thing we could do, was farfetch it. And as

20:41.965 --> 20:49.155
you, growing up, you began to realize that some of 
these things that you disliked,

20:54.535 --> 21:22.062
I

20:54.535 --> 21:22.062
didn't, you know,

20:54.535 --> 21:22.062
I didn't. lying if I said that I understood the 
words at the time, but I did not particularly care

21:23.341 --> 21:37.882
for what I now know to be mass punishment,

21:23.341 --> 21:37.882
and I never have. In fact, later I tell you a story 
that I actually used at A&M, but too often in a

21:40.105 --> 21:52.302
military situation, it's easier to

22:02.069 --> 22:05.834
keep looking to find the guy and then punish the 
hell out of him. That's

22:06.835 --> 22:15.467
a favorite stunt.

22:18.611 --> 22:29.666
In a military organization that has no

22:18.611 --> 22:29.666
real maturity, and I'm talking about maturity and 
age, it's easy for young men to do that. And

22:35.498 --> 22:35.979
happen. They don't realize it is when they do it. 
But

22:40.084 --> 22:45.451
I made some cheater notes the other day. I don't 
think I put down anything I dislike. I

22:47.774 --> 22:54.203
put the question here, why A&M? But I figured you'd 
ask that one. Well, let's talk about that one.

23:00.831 --> 23:02.534
Well, I think we'd already talked about that. I 
think we already talked about why you Out of

23:05.232 --> 23:30.852
those four H's, two went to Rice, one went to Sam 
Houston, and I went to A&M, so that kind of split us

23:05.232 --> 23:30.852
up after high school. The two that went to Rice 
happened to be in a National Guard tank outfit, and

23:32.317 --> 23:42.891
both of them ended up going to Iceland rather than 
finish Rice, because the Guard wouldn't let them

23:32.317 --> 23:42.891
out. You'd

23:43.111 --> 23:51.041
probably have to go back in history to remember us 
going into Iceland with a horse.

23:54.225 --> 24:01.294
I was wondering about what ways the Corps helped 
you in your military career.

24:29.810 --> 24:56.442
I think it gives you, that it gave me a one-up on

24:29.810 --> 24:56.442
my contemporaries that didn't live a core life as 
they were going through

24:29.810 --> 24:56.442
college and taking military, ROGC.

24:58.480 --> 24:59.881
Where is that one up? A little more as to how to get 
along with people. A little more how to manage

25:04.205 --> 25:05.966
people. A little more concern for the needs of 
people. What makes the guy tick?

25:17.236 --> 25:25.543
How many people

25:17.236 --> 25:25.543
are motivated by what? Plans of their ego or play 
into a short time physical need or a long time moral

25:29.783 --> 25:57.495
need or just being able to recognize those things 
in not only your subordinates but the people that

25:29.783 --> 25:57.495
you're dealing with, that you're trying to get or 
to cooperate with you in order to get your or your

25:29.783 --> 25:57.495
boss's job done. It's a laboratory that we 
actually live that, again, the contemporary that

25:59.888 --> 26:20.114
didn't either go to West Point, VMI, or Texas A&M, 
just didn't have. So you had a head start? I

26:23.558 --> 26:24.460
certainly think so.

26:27.223 --> 26:29.406
Again, I was... first lieutenant squadron 
commander at the age of 21. Captain at the age of 22

26:36.075 --> 26:38.959
and major at the age of 23. And, and I could look back 
and see contemporaries that

26:39.520 --> 26:49.114
just weren't going that fast.

26:54.922 --> 26:55.343
I had

27:02.309 --> 27:12.281
Do you think that

27:02.309 --> 27:12.281
there are any ways in which the court hindered your 
career? No.

27:16.627 --> 27:20.832
Not the career that I had chosen.

27:21.973 --> 27:31.405
I think that there are ways that the court could 
hinder certain careers, but after all, for an

27:21.973 --> 27:31.405
individual who wanted to become A military 
officer and a civil engineer doesn't know where

27:31.942 --> 27:45.757
the court

27:31.942 --> 27:45.757
is. Were there certain officers at A&M that helped 
you, while you were a foreman, that helped you as

27:45.777 --> 27:55.087
far as your firm was concerned? Or were you thought 
really fine officers, or in some way were role

27:55.107 --> 28:01.054
models or leaders for you?

28:04.544 --> 28:14.133
Yes.

28:19.518 --> 28:24.943
Colonel Beasley was the head of the Steel 
Artillery.

28:24.963 --> 28:32.290
And

28:24.963 --> 28:32.290
looking back in all of my years in service.

28:39.299 --> 28:58.441
If they handpicked that man for that job, whoever 
did that

28:39.299 --> 28:58.441
one of the most outstanding

28:39.299 --> 28:58.441
jobs ever performed because he was absolutely 
ideal. The we had a a cadre of field artillery

29:05.733 --> 29:16.283
officers that under his guidance and direction

29:05.733 --> 29:16.283
were just super

29:37.255 --> 29:37.936
teenage. And so Garrison was immaculately 
dressed at all times. And

29:43.522 --> 29:49.510
it's pretty warm around A&M. And yet, we can look at 
that man and think, boy, you know, and he gave us

29:50.090 --> 30:01.744
something to try to, you know, live up to, you know, 
He can look that way when he's in the dress uniform

30:02.028 --> 30:08.335
or in uniform and we should look the same way. 
Great. What I'm trying to reach though is the coach

30:10.477 --> 30:17.505
of the rifle and pistol team.

30:27.836 --> 30:31.039
Maybe Bill related this story to you, but I'll get 
his name yet, even if I have to go look it up. Between

30:39.493 --> 30:50.290
our junior and senior year, all the cadets in the 
8th Corps area, except the chem warfare cadets,

30:39.493 --> 30:50.290
met at Bliss in El Paso. And we divided into an 
offensive team and a defensive team.

31:02.525 --> 31:05.650
back down New Mexico, back to Bliss. Then we came on 
back home. Well, you remember I said that we still

31:08.974 --> 31:12.219
had horses. Well, by the time our junior and senior 
year came along, they had wiped the horses out of

31:13.361 --> 31:19.770
the artillery. But the cavalry still had horses. 
They'd load those horses in these great big vans

31:23.495 --> 31:27.681
and move them across country. And then they'd take 
the horses out to make the attack or something like

31:27.721 --> 31:31.587
that.

31:34.503 --> 31:40.092
We were on the defense of Roswell.

31:40.112 --> 31:44.038
And our four guns had been separated. The two guns 
that I was with, we were sitting in an apple

31:44.058 --> 31:47.003
orchard. And the other two guns were way over on the 
other side of Roswell. We didn't even know where

31:51.950 --> 31:53.352
they were. But we knew they were on the defense. And 
intelligence had told us that we were going to be

31:55.596 --> 32:01.405
attacked on our flank by mounted cowboys.

32:04.304 --> 32:17.003
Well, the captain gave the instructions to the 
cadet captain, go ahead and fire your blanks, all

32:04.304 --> 32:17.003
but two, load and lock, and fire on my command. And 
so we went through the procedures of firing up over

32:19.066 --> 32:28.641
the hill, and we didn't even see the captain, but of 
course we knew they were out there somewhere, so we

32:19.066 --> 32:28.641
were just lob

32:34.763 --> 32:36.545
By then we were down to the last two rounds. And he 
said, load and lock and fire on my command. We were

32:42.854 --> 32:47.981
into this apple orchard just about 20 or 30 yards 
off the road. And he let that cavalry get right at

32:48.001 --> 32:52.246
the ditch on the other side of the road. And then he 
said, fire. And when those two cannons went off,

32:59.384 --> 33:05.872
there were 150 riderless men laying on their 
butts, and there were horses all over the hill.

33:05.892 --> 33:08.215
They picked up horses all night that night. This is 
one of our attack officers from A&M. And again,

33:13.121 --> 33:28.480
his handling the rifle team and the pistol team and 
pulling things like that,

33:13.121 --> 33:28.480
pure signs that, you know, They're human, just 
like everybody else. They got a sense of humor.

33:33.878 --> 33:40.585
When you lose that sense of humor, you're gone.

33:40.605 --> 33:48.915
I often wish that we could have had that attack 
officer that I had.

33:54.901 --> 33:55.362
Garrison.

33:58.177 --> 34:04.005
They called us my sophomore year. We were

34:04.726 --> 34:15.321
firing a salute to Governor O'Daniel.

34:15.341 --> 34:20.087
And we had the, our battery was firing a salute. We 
were sitting in

34:20.107 --> 34:27.998
the cedar trees just across,

34:36.466 --> 34:39.289
there in the old assembly building. Great big 
secret. We had all four canons. We were kind of

34:42.832 --> 34:45.715
hidden. And so we had course, the upperclassmen, 
the lettuce part of the solution to guns as long as

34:45.735 --> 34:54.363
we keep the timing. So when you fire 16 gun salute, 
you got a certain timing. Guns go off. Two guns got

35:01.550 --> 35:03.132
to really move. Got to open that breeze and get that 
hot booger out of there and get another one in and

35:03.500 --> 35:07.215
get ready. And they said, okay.

35:33.132 --> 35:45.227
That's one of the reasons that cadets did not like 
to see former Aggies come back to teach military

35:33.132 --> 35:45.227
and to be tackles. Because we went up on them and 
that made them charge a little bit harder to get

35:47.009 --> 35:57.643
ahead of us. Do you think, or what are your thoughts 
on the quality of officer training that you're

36:01.921 --> 36:04.964
receiving?

36:10.430 --> 36:28.789
Well, I've had

36:10.430 --> 36:28.789
many, many

36:10.430 --> 36:28.789
social conversations

36:10.430 --> 36:28.789
and many, many more conversations with 
contemporaries as well as seniors from West

36:31.047 --> 36:41.638
Point.

36:41.658 --> 36:58.877
I wouldn't in any way try to say that that at A&M was 
better than VMI because VMI are faced with the same

36:41.658 --> 36:58.877
problems that people at A&M are faced with. The

37:01.473 --> 37:27.295
quality of training for me is so much better

37:01.473 --> 37:27.295
at A&M and BMI

37:01.473 --> 37:27.295
than at one of the military schools because One of 
the military academies? One of the military

37:30.950 --> 37:32.413
academies. West Point, Annapolis, or even the Air 
Force Academy.

37:38.503 --> 37:56.252
Because to start with,

37:38.503 --> 37:56.252
the beginner didn't get there by being 
hand-selected and therefore have the feeling

37:38.503 --> 37:56.252
that

37:59.303 --> 38:03.128
I am something just by being human. He still has to 
win his first and he still has a chance of being the

38:03.148 --> 38:16.447
top guy or he can end up right on the bottom. He is not 
assured that if he graduates that he's going to

38:16.467 --> 38:27.302
have any type of a career, which therefore doesn't 
build into him any type of complacency.

38:38.402 --> 38:57.508
He has a more awkward look on life

38:38.402 --> 38:57.508
and the way life is lived and even business and 
economy. You don't have just blinders on that

38:58.417 --> 39:06.072
says, let's take one of the schools, Westmont, I 
want to name it. Everybody takes the same course,

39:06.572 --> 39:16.411
no matter whether you came there with two years, 
three years, or were already a graduate from

39:06.572 --> 39:16.411
another college or what, and you take this course, 
and when you finish, you're a second lieutenant.

39:16.431 --> 39:21.100
Now, according to rank in the class, you can decide 
what you want to go into. The infantry, the

39:21.502 --> 39:26.089
engineers, or the artillery, or what do you want to 
go into? And you get your pick, according to so many

39:26.109 --> 39:28.814
down the line.

39:41.674 --> 39:48.184
They say,

39:41.674 --> 39:48.184
well, that's what they're supposed to do, but I 
don't fully agree. They have educated this man to

39:49.750 --> 39:54.916
do one thing, and that's to serve in the army.

39:58.980 --> 40:16.580
Unfortunately, when the guy gets to a certain 
level, and he gets there in a hurry, he's got to deal

39:58.980 --> 40:16.580
with too many people that are not subject to 
military discipline. That's civil servants. And

40:19.147 --> 40:29.642
he's got to deal with business people to see that 
he's getting the best deal that he can for the Army

40:19.147 --> 40:29.642
or for his unit. And it's just not there. And so you 
think at West Point they just don't have that

40:33.268 --> 40:38.275
training, but they do at A&M? Certainly.

40:41.540 --> 40:48.630
Even more so now that the Corps is a minor group of 
the colleges or the universities I was done. And

40:49.883 --> 40:58.196
still managed to, managing to hold its own in the 
university and be as influential as it is.

41:01.361 --> 41:03.384
Because they're working both sides of the street.

41:07.310 --> 41:15.563
Of course, when I was there, it was compulsory and 
everybody, you know, even your junior and senior

41:07.310 --> 41:15.563
year, even if you didn't, You weren't taken 
military. You still lived in the unit and you still

41:16.981 --> 41:19.846
wore a uniform. So you feel then that becoming an 
Aggie officer, you're more qualified to be an

41:21.028 --> 41:31.827
officer than at the military academy? Ah, sure. 
How about at other ROTC type institutions? Only if

41:36.395 --> 41:40.723
they're in a core situation and that's the reason I 
included VMI.

41:45.530 --> 41:56.500
Could you make a generalization about other ROTC 
schools and the type of officer that they produce

41:45.530 --> 41:56.500
versus the Aggie officers? Well, no more than to 
say that they are meeting

41:56.520 --> 42:13.596
their goal or their mission, and that is to turn out 
a reserve officer. who may or may not, of his own

42:14.268 --> 42:25.724
free will, decide to stay on active duty and become 
a regular officer.

42:25.744 --> 42:36.419
Again, as we said earlier, I just think that this 
guy that has lived the core situation has got that

42:25.744 --> 42:36.419
one-up. He's got a broader outlook because it's 
not limited to just serve it in the military. What

42:46.269 --> 42:47.350
about VMI? Do you compare the Aggie training with 
that of VMI and the quality of the officers? Yes,

42:55.201 --> 42:55.642
I've seen it too. Very, very similar. From what I 
have witnessed, the VMI officers that I know, as

42:57.945 --> 43:06.617
compared to the service

43:10.934 --> 43:13.677
Let's talk about your academic career at A&M. Why?

43:18.322 --> 43:19.444
Well, you might sum it up. I said a while ago that I 
took freshman chemistry two semesters credit. I

43:26.732 --> 43:30.276
took it five semesters.

43:32.679 --> 43:39.186
I went to summer school two summers and still at the 
end of my fourth year.

43:55.028 --> 43:56.450
studied petroleum engineering. The first year, 
all engineering the same, but then while it's the

43:58.033 --> 44:03.182
second year, it begins to switch. I mean, to vary 
and branch out. And I finally convinced him I

44:07.689 --> 44:10.875
didn't want to be a petroleum engineer. He said, 
okay, study mechanical. And I said, well,

44:12.658 --> 44:15.282
mechanical, mechanical. So

44:25.960 --> 44:29.465
been good friends for a long time. And I finally 
left that school and looked back and said, man, the

44:29.485 --> 44:46.166
quickest way I can get out of here is I'm going to 
have a degree by the time I'm finished to go

44:29.485 --> 44:46.166
engineering administration, which of course 
they no longer have there. But most of it was based

44:46.186 --> 44:50.432
on

44:59.238 --> 45:07.166
Anyway, I needed about 14 hours at the time that 
May, June 41 rolled around. And coincidentally,

45:07.186 --> 45:10.529
there were 14 of us. And they put in, asked for a 
deferment bar, and none of us got a deferment. The

45:21.320 --> 45:23.502
war class went, period. We all had orders before we 
were even commissioned.

45:28.820 --> 45:53.136
So academically, I guess I was there to

45:28.820 --> 45:53.136
study when I wanted to study and make the grades 
when I could and spend more time working

45:28.820 --> 45:53.136
on the newspaper.

45:53.216 --> 45:58.624
At the start of my junior year, I had the academics 
to get in the Ross Volunteer.

46:06.063 --> 46:08.887
I was eligible to be a four-striper. I had to be a 
scholastic junior to be a four-striper. Made it

46:12.312 --> 46:16.638
into the Ross Volunteers, but then didn't make it 
in my senior year. And it was mid-year, senior year

46:17.679 --> 46:25.490
before I ever got to be a commission officer. By 
that time, I got the single one-button second

46:25.510 --> 46:29.916
lieutenant. Were there any, do you remember any 
faculty or staff professional soldiers, but

46:34.531 --> 46:39.363
teachers that had an impact on you. An impact?

46:46.340 --> 46:48.426
Are you close to any faculty members? Close to, you 
say?
