WEBVTT

00:01.567 --> 00:06.112
He was in what was the old Bryan High School for the 
last year. Then they built the new school. Now

00:08.895 --> 00:14.480
that's a bunch of youngsters that had a good time. 
They really had a good time. Then he went to A&M. He

00:21.808 --> 00:28.014
was

00:21.808 --> 00:28.014
an unqualified junior. Isn't there some attitude 
there? He had to do some extra work in the junior

00:31.148 --> 00:37.355
class. I don't know what that is called. But he 
persuaded me to let him go on in. So that's when he

00:44.142 --> 00:45.684
tried to get in. Then he went to Houston and got in.

00:53.212 --> 00:58.058
But he loved airplanes from the time he could. One 
of the first words he said was airplane. And I had an

01:00.899 --> 01:16.661
old chair, one of the way back yonder kind, high 
back, and I put a seat in the chair that had, it

01:00.899 --> 01:16.661
looked like made of panel wood, but had designs 
punched in it. And I gave, he had a box of ten penny

01:17.763 --> 01:24.833
nails and a rubber hammer that he played with. And 
one day, he was in Rompers, he, uh, put the nails in

01:31.038 --> 01:36.687
the holes of that chair, just like an airplane. He 
says, Daddy, airplane. And he was just airplane

01:40.073 --> 01:42.938
crazy all the time. And he really did make his name 
in that airplane. He catered with the brass.

01:54.416 --> 01:54.717
Uh-huh, uh-huh. That sounds pretty good. What 
about that? I guess, you know, over the years, I

01:57.312 --> 02:06.065
guess, in taking my history courses and stuff like 
that, you know, they always talked about the

01:57.312 --> 02:06.065
depression and things like that and everything. 
How did it affect you? We was in a depression. This

02:10.231 --> 02:10.892
don't work. We was in a depression. We didn't know 
too much about those kind of things. But we felt it

02:18.143 --> 02:20.527
very keenly. We had to cut down on a lot of things. 
And the business... You know, you had to have

02:26.050 --> 02:33.803
gasoline, and the business didn't deteriorate 
too much, but it did slow down. But he weathered the

02:35.025 --> 02:38.551
storm. Most people did.

02:43.400 --> 02:44.642
I don't know. Well, let's see. What else do I have 
here? What about... What about the community life

02:48.967 --> 02:52.872
here in Bryan College Station? Is Bryan older than 
College Station? Oh, yeah. College Station's

02:57.858 --> 03:00.521
just grown up the last few years. It really has? The 
Boondall, you know, was the first courthouse.

03:06.889 --> 03:09.252
That's out about two miles, isn't it? Out east of 
town. Why did they decide to move it here? Because

03:14.239 --> 03:16.061
the railroad come in. The railroad came in. 
Uh-huh. And the railroad had gotten as far as

03:18.548 --> 03:25.555
Milligan, and it came from Milligan then on up 
here. But the railroad brought Brian over here.

03:30.481 --> 03:39.330
And Brian was named for a Mr. Brian who had 
offsprings at the First National Bank here. Mr.

03:39.350 --> 03:42.393
God brought Mr. What's the Brian boy named? 
Travis. Travis Brian. He was his son, wasn't he?

03:47.641 --> 03:50.744
No, he was the second generation. He's the third 
generation. And they named the town for him. He

03:57.432 --> 04:03.358
advanced a whole lot of the financial 
necessities, you know. And this Mr.

04:04.559 --> 04:17.293
Bryan's father did a lot for Bryan Air Force Base. 
And he engineered a collection and got an

04:17.510 --> 04:22.555
airplane. What's the name of that airplane, 
Willie Bell?

04:28.501 --> 04:32.865
I'm getting along pretty good with a friend of mine 
that's come in, Miss Willie Bell Johnson. She

04:33.346 --> 04:34.867
knows more about it than I do. She's not near as old 
as I am.

04:43.396 --> 04:46.680
What about A&M when that started? A&M has grown. 
1976. I know that well. 1976. My uncle was born that

04:52.989 --> 04:55.633
year. He went to school after a little while. And 
the A&M, well, a lot of the tuitions were paid from

05:04.344 --> 05:12.255
rural districts, paid with... We had wood and 
everything out there then. They took meats and

05:17.156 --> 05:26.906
cordwood and different things like that on 
payment for the tuitions, you know. And a friend of

05:26.927 --> 05:36.397
mine used to bring wood over there, driving a 
four-mural team, you know, bringing cord after

05:26.927 --> 05:36.397
cord. It had a contractor. to get the word for 
heating system out there. And then of course it

05:44.720 --> 05:59.340
advanced very early just from boys taking all 
courses and each year there would be another type

05:44.720 --> 05:59.340
of education, you know. And so it's just really and 
truly outgrown itself in a way. And the first

06:06.547 --> 06:11.071
students were 14 years old when they started out 
there. Huh? The first students were 14 years old. I

06:13.313 --> 06:15.014
mean, they took them at 14 years. They took them at 
14 years. Then they went to 16.

06:21.560 --> 06:30.729
Well,

06:21.560 --> 06:30.729
is there anything you can think of that I might not 
have covered that you'd like to say or whatever?

06:31.069 --> 06:31.990
Well, uh, Of course, we had the Carnegie Library in 
Bryan. I believe it was in 1902, and it has outgrown

06:37.864 --> 06:44.672
itself. We now have a new City of Bryan Library, but 
the old library, some talk about them tearing it

06:45.212 --> 07:01.791
down, but everybody seemed to want it for a museum, 
if nothing else, because it was a donation to the

06:45.212 --> 07:01.791
city. But they are temporarily using it as a 
traffic office. And it seems like it's working out

07:10.269 --> 07:14.913
very nicely for that, you see. And then, of course, 
we've had trouble having enough water and

07:15.654 --> 07:25.663
everything, but we're still on top, I think, with 
everything. And the college dances were always

07:26.944 --> 07:31.288
wonderful. And most always, the gentlemen, the 
boys would take their girlfriends out in what they

07:32.011 --> 07:44.457
called, what

07:32.011 --> 07:44.457
is that old nigger man's name? It was a surrey. He 
used to take a bunch of them out. Tally, I believe

07:51.211 --> 07:52.433
his name was. It was a tally. Huh? I remember him 
talking about a tally. Well, I believe it was Tally

07:55.856 --> 07:57.497
Surrey. And he'd make trip after trip coming to 
Bryan. And it was a long way around then. See, this

08:04.085 --> 08:10.412
road has been changed two times since I've been 
here to Bryan. It's the shorter way now. But he took

08:13.355 --> 08:16.278
the young folks out. And sometimes some of them are 
pretty late getting back in on you. But they used to

08:20.797 --> 08:24.461
have wonderful, wonderful dances, which they 
still do. And it's just marvelous the way that they

08:25.643 --> 08:31.069
have been able to do it. We didn't remember 
distinctly when the first automobile came to

08:32.451 --> 08:36.336
Bryan. Then for a long time, between Bryan and 
College Station, they had the, what do they call

08:37.097 --> 08:43.865
that trolley? Interurban. Interurban. They had 
that there. And I went to summer school one summer

08:48.927 --> 08:51.749
out there. And I rode this, rode that. And the depot 
was right down, right down here. Well, right at the

08:58.055 --> 09:00.957
old fire station. Was it over there? Right across 
over there. No, the inner urban depot. It was at the

09:08.344 --> 09:09.145
fire station. It was a little bit further over 
where the Eagle office is. Yeah, where the Eagle

09:11.507 --> 09:13.809
office is now. The inner urban used to have that 
office there. And they run... Trolley cars. Every

09:20.981 --> 09:22.383
half hour, I believe. And I got my transportation 
to school out there on that trolley.

09:30.876 --> 09:32.499
And that's about all. That's the only way. Horse 
bugging horse, you know, of course.

09:39.891 --> 09:44.278
Due to the fact the railroad ran through Bryan made 
the sights even more favorable. But when the

09:44.418 --> 09:47.082
commissioners arrived and found saloons on every 
corner. The commissioners moved further out

09:48.461 --> 10:00.813
until historians say the commissioners came to a 
place thick with dewberries, and here they stuck a

09:48.461 --> 10:00.813
stake in the ground and said, here we'll build a 
college. You ought to have that, isn't it? Yeah.

10:04.977 --> 10:08.360
Talking about that, was Brown a pretty wild town? 
Had lots of saloons. It had worlds of saloons, and

10:10.843 --> 10:15.347
as I said, every... three, four doors was a saloon. 
We were never, in going to town, we were never, we

10:18.903 --> 10:27.032
were always told never look in a livery stable and 
never look in a saloon. But we'd cock our eye

10:27.512 --> 10:29.054
around. We had a livery stable right on Main 
Street. One big livery stable was on, Tabor's

10:33.078 --> 10:37.223
livery stable was on Main Street. But we had ever so 
many saloons just, and they, you know, It wasn't a

10:46.968 --> 10:48.149
while. I think we are worse now than we used to be. 
Really? Mm-hmm. We never had a lock on our doors in

10:54.155 --> 10:56.938
days gone by. And within the last few years, why, 
they've had to put locks on everything they own. I

11:04.885 --> 11:06.047
know, yeah. And we really and truly, I remember 
many a night. When we lived on North Bryan Street,

11:12.072 --> 11:16.857
one morning we waked up, Every window in the house, 
every door in the house was wide open. And on our

11:21.717 --> 11:30.132
front porch was a row of transient cotton pickers 
seeping on our front porch, and we didn't know it.

11:31.635 --> 11:32.035
Golly. I'll bet there was 10 people, 10 men out 
there on our front porch, and we didn't know it. So

11:40.580 --> 11:45.827
that's how bad we were then. But we wouldn't do it 
today. What other things that you've noticed, you

11:50.432 --> 11:56.840
know, the town or the people's attitudes or things 
like that have changed? Very much so. There used to

11:59.724 --> 12:06.132
be an awful lot of man-to-man attitude, you know. 
But I think now it's dollar-to-dollar. I might be

12:10.364 --> 12:13.048
wrong. I don't do too much trading myself. I've 
been here since 67, so I don't know too much about

12:15.852 --> 12:22.662
the family. I mean, I've been up here at the hotel. 
But

12:26.308 --> 12:30.874
I have. I've weathered the storm pretty good. I'll 
be 90 years over in December, and that's a lot of

12:34.560 --> 12:37.304
years. That's a lot of years, and you're still a 
little active.
