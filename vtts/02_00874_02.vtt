00:04.098 --> 00:27.482
As a result of the financial strength of the 
developers' financial support, which was

00:04.098 --> 00:27.482
Gibraltar Savings, which is the largest savings 
and loan in Texas, at that time had assets of over $8

00:04.098 --> 00:27.482
billion, they were able to master plan the entire 
development and put in all of the major

00:04.098 --> 00:27.482
infrastructure in phase one. So what was proposed 
was a new community of some 65,000 to 80,000 people

00:34.878 --> 00:44.591
that would be within the jurisdiction of 
McKinney, which is a town of 18,000 people, which,

00:34.878 --> 00:44.591
believe it or not, has more historical structures 
than the city of Galveston. Is that right? It's a

00:46.153 --> 00:59.951
quaint, fascinating little town that has some 
very progressive staff that has the character of

00:46.153 --> 00:59.951
some wonderful 19th century architecture in 
urban form. Where is it located? It's straight

01:01.753 --> 01:04.497
north of Dallas on Nile. Highway, past Plain 75. 
Yes, just north of Plain. So I was hired in

01:10.720 --> 01:26.285
association with a financial consultant to 
organize and lead a negotiation team that would

01:10.720 --> 01:26.285
negotiate the approvals of these development 
proposals. It was envisioned that this

01:27.206 --> 01:37.723
development would have, as I said, 65,000 to 
80,000 people, three 18-hole golf courses, seven

01:27.206 --> 01:37.723
lakes, nine schools, hundreds of miles of 
streets, three fire stations, perhaps a new city

01:39.020 --> 01:52.065
hall, and a sports board of other community 
facilities and infrastructure improvements

01:39.020 --> 01:52.065
that would be required for that development. As a 
result of Again, the experience of

01:56.789 --> 02:20.700
infrastructure planning and the financing 
requirements on the one hand, and knowing a bit

01:56.789 --> 02:20.700
about the role of city planning and growth 
management, and having a little experience in

01:56.789 --> 02:20.700
negotiation, we were able to negotiate what I 
believe was the largest development agreement in

01:56.789 --> 02:20.700
the history of Texas. And in a matter of 90 days... 
Larger than what role? Well, the Woodlands was not

02:26.152 --> 02:27.774
a development agreement. It was just a 
development. But this was a negotiated

02:29.335 --> 02:40.166
agreement, an actual contractual agreement 
between the city of McKinney and the developers of

02:29.335 --> 02:40.166
Flying M Ranch in Gibraltar City. Contractual 
agreement that required a series of quid pro quos.

02:46.352 --> 02:49.575
The city would provide, would annex and provide 
certain zoning. And the developer would install

02:50.616 --> 02:54.640
certain infrastructure. and other community 
services in a whole medley of amenity

02:55.008 --> 03:19.622
packages, if you will, that would allow the city 
to, as it quadrupled in size, to maintain a quality

02:55.008 --> 03:19.622
of urban services and quality of urban form that 
would be commensurate with what the city had

02:55.008 --> 03:19.622
before. It was on the order of magnitude of eighty 
odd million dollars worth of improvements that

03:25.315 --> 03:31.083
were negotiated and agreed upon. And it involved

03:31.143 --> 03:40.176
numerous firms working for the city as well as for 
the developer to bring all this together. But it

03:42.198 --> 03:50.790
was, I think, to be a very profitable project for 
the developer to have all this comprehensively

03:42.198 --> 03:50.790
planned. And for the city it was

03:54.712 --> 04:09.855
the benefit of comprehensive planning on a scale 
that most cities never had the opportunity to do,

03:54.712 --> 04:09.855
let alone sign on the bottom line. What has been 
their experience since signing? I have not been

04:16.605 --> 04:21.613
able to monitor it because I quickly got involved 
in some other water-related projects. But I think

04:24.510 --> 04:50.689
those three examples represent this whole new 
dimension of planning that we coined as

04:24.510 --> 04:50.689
negotiated growth management, which involves a 
lot of the experiences that people talk about

04:24.510 --> 04:50.689
today in terms of mediation and dispute 
resolution, negotiation, getting to yes, as one

04:51.344 --> 05:05.660
book calls it, and the basic physical planning and 
financial planning dimensions that I think urban

04:51.344 --> 05:05.660
planners need to understand anyway. I keep asking 
myself, but isn't this what has always happened?

05:12.568 --> 05:18.955
And aren't we just using new buzzwords for 
something that has always been processed? And I

05:19.255 --> 05:23.363
don't know what the answer to that nagging 
question is. I know that MIT and Harvard and the

05:24.264 --> 05:32.099
joint program up there are heavily involved in 
negotiation. And certainly, I think that

05:33.261 --> 05:37.669
planning education, getting back to that a 
minute, has always been somewhat neglectful of

05:38.189 --> 06:03.741
the role of relating the planning process to the 
decision process in a way that makes it clear to

05:38.189 --> 06:03.741
students how they must react and respond to 
decision makers and those that they deal with. I

06:05.020 --> 06:23.969
think that's one of the weak points of the A&M 
program, with the exception of people like Jim

06:05.020 --> 06:23.969
Gardner, who has always been in it and has run for 
city council successfully several times, and can

06:05.020 --> 06:23.969
speak with total authority on that subject. But I 
personally have I asked the question when I've

06:28.375 --> 06:39.620
seen some of the new articles coming out on the 
subject of negotiation and conferences being

06:28.375 --> 06:39.620
held on negotiation and so forth. What's new about 
it? Well, I didn't mean to say that what I was doing

06:42.213 --> 06:58.498
was innovative, but I think the nuance that has 
really become a standard operating procedure

06:42.213 --> 06:58.498
only in the last two or three years is what is often 
called development agreements. These are

06:59.660 --> 07:04.528
negotiated agreements between the public and 
private sector. They're not ventures. to see what

07:07.880 --> 07:16.391
can be done by a civic-minded developer in an 
entrepreneurial-oriented city necessarily.

07:17.072 --> 07:32.993
But it's what was normally a clash between the city 
struggling with how it can manage and sometimes

07:17.072 --> 07:32.993
control growth on one hand, and the developer that 
sees the regulatory milieu as a maze and a series of

07:17.072 --> 07:32.993
obstacles that often require hiring lobbyists to 
overcome.

07:39.538 --> 07:49.711
What has come out of the projects that I've been 
involved in is a negotiation process that is very

07:39.538 --> 07:49.711
legal in nature. It comes out with contractual 
agreements based on hedging the risk for the

07:49.731 --> 08:00.145
entrepreneur and securing a lot of the amenities 
that cities often never are able to get

08:01.154 --> 08:08.818
commitments for. until the citizens are already 
there begging for it. I'm also leery of too many

08:12.899 --> 08:31.802
lawyers meddling in planning, and I cite as an 
example the American Law Institute's Model Land

08:12.899 --> 08:31.802
Development Code, which would have reduced the 
process that you're describing to simply written

08:33.942 --> 08:44.679
briefs, and everything would have had to be in 
writing, and everyone would have had to be

08:33.942 --> 08:44.679
committed to the gills before any contact was 
made. Which is not financially feasible the way

08:45.360 --> 08:49.546
the banks operate. It didn't leave much room for 
exactly what you're interested in, negotiation,

08:49.687 --> 08:58.841
because everybody's position would have been 
hardened before there had been any confrontation

08:49.687 --> 08:58.841
at all. That's a good point. And I feel that 
resolving it through discussion, negotiation,

09:00.655 --> 09:23.334
whatever you want to call it, exchange of ideas and 
trade-offs, is knowing what the position of the

09:00.655 --> 09:23.334
government agency is in terms of its goals and 
objectives and policies is certainly the way to

09:00.655 --> 09:23.334
go. But case in point is an attorney would never 
fathom the idea that a contractual agreement

09:30.693 --> 09:45.664
would have the ability to be evaluated and updated 
and monitored over time to allow appropriate

09:30.693 --> 09:45.664
revisions to be made at various milestones, which 
is really what planners always require in order to

09:46.302 --> 09:52.755
keep something from getting so outmoded that you 
have to just throw the whole damn thing out. And so

09:53.236 --> 10:06.623
in these negotiated agreements, those updates 
and abilities by mutual agreement to revise

09:53.236 --> 10:06.623
things and plan for that ahead of time was 
something that, again, attorneys really had to

10:07.244 --> 10:12.052
struggle to find the boilerplate language to put 
it down. That would have been amusing. You may not,

10:15.438 --> 10:31.446
I don't think you agree with me on this, that the 
American, well the Model Land Development Code I

10:15.438 --> 10:31.446
think failed miserably in not requiring a plan 
diagram to be a part of an adopted comprehensive

10:15.438 --> 10:31.446
plan. Well, I think plan diagrams are very 
important for a couple of reasons. Anytime you're

10:42.470 --> 11:03.458
talking about land, real property, the ability to 
communicate that is essential in terms of

10:42.470 --> 11:03.458
people's ability to relate what they own to what 
the police powers are going to do. be affecting

11:04.163 --> 11:07.667
what they own and what other people own. And maps 
are communication devices. Well, you know, the

11:10.851 --> 11:16.077
Austin Tomorrow Plan did not do this.

11:16.097 --> 11:25.468
Well, they did it at such a gross and small scale 
that it had no import to the individual property

11:16.097 --> 11:25.468
owner. That's all right, but I don't think that 
they did it really. They had growth corridors

11:29.192 --> 11:33.057
established, which is quite a different matter. 
And it didn't show a circulation system. And it

11:37.598 --> 11:41.341
didn't show a lot of things that a plan diagram 
would show. Nor did it deal adequately with the

11:43.102 --> 11:49.808
implementation strategies. Very weak in 
implementation. But I think the biggest failing

11:52.350 --> 12:03.820
of that plan, and it's true of a lot of other plans 
too, is that the commitment of subsequent city

11:52.350 --> 12:03.820
councils was not there to fund it through capital 
improvements program. Without those bottom line

12:04.728 --> 12:14.417
dollars supporting those plans, there's no way 
for a developer to see the benefits of the city's

12:04.728 --> 12:14.417
ways.

12:18.081 --> 12:26.589
Well, pressure started to build up regarding the 
plan and its perceived restrictive nature. And

12:28.131 --> 12:30.313
that was apparently enough to kill it. So they've 
started in with an entirely new planning program.

12:39.743 --> 12:47.738
Ken, thanks very much for your time and your input 
to this program of the American Planning

12:39.743 --> 12:47.738
Association Texas Chapter. This tape will be 
transcribed and God only knows when that will

12:49.300 --> 12:54.149
happen. The right things are going at the moment, 
but eventually you'll get a transcription which I

12:56.333 --> 13:03.827
will then look for you to make changes in. Any 
additions or deletions that come to mind at that

13:07.146 --> 13:13.156
time would be gratefully appreciated. And we'll 
then put it back onto the computer disk and run out

13:13.777 --> 13:18.905
our final hard copy. Thanks again. Thank you, Bob.
