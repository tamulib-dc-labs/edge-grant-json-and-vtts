WEBVTT

00:02.883 --> 00:08.575
Blaine and his brother, the Rideout brothers.

00:09.537 --> 00:16.251
One of them finally was a trainer at Bryan High School for 30 years, just called him Doc.

00:17.311 --> 00:21.937
I think they were North Texas graduates and had been in the Olympics.

00:22.017 --> 00:25.601
They were milers, distance runners.

00:25.621 --> 00:30.968
But they were our trainers and on-the-job physicians and everything else.

00:31.108 --> 00:42.682
And so when I got injured, I tried to come back later, but I couldn't keep a shoulder in place and had a tremendous amount of pain.

00:43.924 --> 00:46.727
They just said, well, there's nothing we can do about it.

00:46.707 --> 00:53.576
Back in those days, you didn't have surgery and you didn't have rotator cuff surgery and all those kind of things.

00:53.636 --> 00:58.122
So they just said, looks like you can't play football anymore.

00:58.542 --> 01:06.032
And it was a real, you know, just a matter of fact play.

01:06.012 --> 01:09.595
There wasn't anything much done about it.

01:09.636 --> 01:11.037
You just, that was it.

01:11.597 --> 01:13.820
And that was in the spring of your freshman year?

01:13.900 --> 01:16.322
Yeah.

01:16.863 --> 01:20.646
So did you lose the scholarship support?

01:20.927 --> 01:25.671
Yeah, well, I had to go into a regular outfit the next year.

01:26.872 --> 01:28.454
And what outfit was that?

01:30.696 --> 01:32.678
I was in F flight.

01:33.569 --> 01:34.371
F Flight?

01:34.711 --> 01:37.377
Flight, I was in the Air Force.

01:37.397 --> 01:38.620
Air Force outfit.

01:38.920 --> 01:39.942
Where was it located?

01:40.403 --> 01:41.746
Darm 8.

01:42.247 --> 01:44.512
In the new dorms?

01:44.592 --> 01:45.654
Yeah, quite there, yeah.

01:46.977 --> 01:49.543
I was in Darm 8 and F Flight.

01:49.883 --> 01:53.130
How was life different over there compared to Hart Hall?

01:53.768 --> 02:00.301
Well, it was strictly, I mean, it was tight military.

02:00.522 --> 02:03.829
The class system was very fixed.

02:04.410 --> 02:09.280
The drills and ceremony and intramural programs were

02:09.260 --> 02:26.682
It was, you know, it was really, and you were confined to campus, you didn't ever get to go home maybe once a semester.

02:27.984 --> 02:34.472
Of course, you got to go home for Christmas, but it was a tight schedule.

02:34.733 --> 02:38.237
How were you treated as a person who transferred into that unit?

02:38.926 --> 02:54.989
Well, they were anxious to get us that had been in Hart Hall because I ended up running their athletic intramural program for my outfit, and I always got along real well.

02:55.210 --> 03:00.798
Was there a nickname for, you weren't a frog, was there a nickname for someone transferring in?

03:01.459 --> 03:07.768
No, not when you originally came to A&M, no.

03:07.748 --> 03:13.680
Just a sophomore peahead, just like anybody else.

03:14.021 --> 03:17.267
I didn't care for transfers for several reasons.

03:17.969 --> 03:23.219
Did Coach Steitler say goodbye to you, chat with you?

03:23.821 --> 03:25.163
No, not really.

03:25.224 --> 03:26.466
It was just...

03:28.235 --> 03:43.262
It was just one of those, it was just almost like you went down to the training room one day and they said they'd done everything they could for you and that was just it.

03:43.322 --> 03:46.107
That's the way they, the way everybody was.

03:46.228 --> 03:49.213
It wasn't a big, athletics wasn't a big deal.

03:49.193 --> 03:52.558
During that freshman year, what formation did you all run?

03:53.399 --> 03:58.907
Oh, everybody ran T formation, just like high school.

03:58.927 --> 04:01.691
And you were playing tackle?

04:02.072 --> 04:05.637
Yeah, offense and defense.

04:05.657 --> 04:08.482
And what was the record of the freshman team?

04:09.723 --> 04:14.931
Oh, I think we went undefeated, best I remember.

04:16.750 --> 04:30.167
As the year went on, next year, did you retain friendship with some of those athletes?

04:30.187 --> 04:30.747
Oh, yeah.

04:31.388 --> 04:32.770
Still do to this day.

04:32.790 --> 04:39.818
I mean, we ended up, when we graduated, we didn't have about 6,000 students today.

04:40.940 --> 04:43.483
I don't know what our graduating class was probably.

04:44.830 --> 04:47.175
four or five hundred or something like that.

04:47.195 --> 04:50.381
So we've known each other forever.

04:52.164 --> 04:56.793
For those last three years, how did you earn the money to pay the bills here?

04:57.334 --> 05:06.973
Well, I got a contract, of course, a military contract which paid

05:09.164 --> 05:21.859
Well, we got our uniforms and our laundry, and I can't remember.

05:21.879 --> 05:27.686
I know it cost me a dollar a day to eat.

05:29.448 --> 05:31.290
I worked

05:31.574 --> 05:37.785
all my summers full through to make money to pay what I had to pay.

05:38.807 --> 05:43.075
But our meals were a dollar a day, all we could eat.

05:44.698 --> 05:55.978
And we had our uniforms, and if we were on military contract, we got some spending money from that military contract.

05:55.958 --> 06:01.864
Of course, we were obligated to go in the service, which we all were.

06:04.107 --> 06:13.157
But it didn't take much money, so I think tuition was still $25.

06:13.457 --> 06:20.785
During those years, particularly that first year, did you make any of the core trips?

06:21.592 --> 06:31.298
I may not have made any core trips my first year, but I did every year thereafter.

06:31.615 --> 06:33.137
Were there any that were special?

06:34.559 --> 06:34.619
Oh.

06:36.462 --> 06:38.845
Was there something that happened that was important to you?

06:39.046 --> 06:42.290
No, I can remember a few of them.

06:42.431 --> 06:53.927
I remember one to Rice, Houston, because we met, we formed a parade at Shamrock.

06:53.907 --> 06:58.752
which was a brand new hotel and was quite a thing.

06:58.792 --> 07:15.890
And of course, to eventually in my career to have been involved in buying the shamrock and tearing it down and building the Institute of Biological Sciences was kind of ironic.

07:15.910 --> 07:18.953
I remember court trips in Dallas and Austin.

07:19.355 --> 07:22.180
How did you travel on those court trips?

07:22.781 --> 07:25.165
Oh, I never left this campus.

07:25.305 --> 07:26.667
I didn't hitchhike.

07:28.410 --> 07:30.593
Only one football player had a car.

07:30.874 --> 07:32.076
That was Glenn Lippman.

07:32.136 --> 07:33.558
He had a Plymouth.

07:34.881 --> 07:37.705
We never went anywhere in automobiles.

07:37.725 --> 07:39.849
We hitchhiked everywhere we went.

07:39.869 --> 07:43.675
Did you ever have a negative experience as an Aggie hitchhiker?

07:44.482 --> 07:47.526
I had some strange experiences.

07:47.926 --> 07:48.627
Describe them.

07:49.748 --> 07:54.995
Well, I remember being picked up by a carloader of nuns.

07:55.015 --> 08:07.170
I can remember being picked up by a person intoxicated one time and had to bag my way out of that.

08:07.791 --> 08:13.898
My roommate probably had one of the most interesting.

08:13.878 --> 08:30.891
As I say, we hitchhiked, they had a line at every gate, and of course there was a, you had a class priority and then you had arrival time priority and different things, but there was never any problem getting a ride.

08:31.276 --> 08:44.363
My roommate was hitchhiking to Port Arthur one time with somebody that eventually became our pastor at our church named Bob Davidson, and they got picked up.

08:44.463 --> 08:47.209
Well, we couldn't get to Beaumont.

08:47.189 --> 08:56.223
You had to go through Houston to get to Beaumont, and it cost a nickel to ride the bus.

08:57.225 --> 08:59.348
You couldn't hitchhike across Houston.

08:59.368 --> 09:05.839
You had to ride the bus across Houston and get out on the other side and hitchhike out of there.

09:07.221 --> 09:09.545
There wasn't any roads.

09:09.625 --> 09:14.833
You couldn't go to Beaumont like you can now.

09:17.125 --> 09:29.327
Denny and Bob were hitchhiking to Port Arthur one weekend and got picked up by two ladies, two women.

09:30.709 --> 09:37.682
And of course, I say one of these, my roommate was pretty wild.

09:38.050 --> 09:55.245
Things that happened didn't bother him too much, but the one that came, our youth minister, these two women picked them up, and the first thing he wanted them to do was, you know, have a cigarette with them and so forth.

09:55.345 --> 09:56.728
Well, Denny, it didn't bother him.

09:56.748 --> 09:59.974
He smoked all the time, but Bob never had a cigarette in his mouth.

09:59.954 --> 10:09.203
And he tried it, but these women got more aggressive as the trip went on.

10:09.343 --> 10:16.050
So when they got to Liberty, Texas, men had to stop for a light.

10:16.130 --> 10:22.016
Bob grabbed Denny and jerked him out of the car, and they got out of the car.

10:23.037 --> 10:25.800
Bob wasn't going to go with these girls anymore.

10:26.080 --> 10:29.303
They were getting too familiar with them.

10:29.283 --> 10:48.647
And so, interestingly enough, the next week, Life Magazine had one of these girls on the cover, and she had done a striptease in the water fountain at LSU.

10:49.528 --> 10:57.838
Her name was Stormy, so they had got picked up by a couple of prostitutes or strippers, I guess.

10:57.818 --> 11:03.643
It made a lasting impression on Bob.

11:06.646 --> 11:07.646
So I don't know.

11:07.666 --> 11:17.455
They were a strange thing, but as a rule, I hitchhiked everywhere, never had any problems, never thought about having a problem, never was afraid to hitchhike.

11:18.716 --> 11:21.799
Those first years, how often did you go home?

11:22.619 --> 11:26.863
Well, we couldn't go.

11:29.088 --> 11:33.513
Well, we didn't go home at all my freshman year.

11:33.533 --> 11:34.374
Thanksgiving?

11:35.715 --> 11:41.121
Well, no, we had football games.

11:42.402 --> 11:50.731
I know we went home Christmas, and I don't remember.

11:50.772 --> 11:54.015
In sophomore, we couldn't really go home at all.

11:54.856 --> 11:56.539
because that wasn't our privilege.

11:56.679 --> 12:08.217
Now, juniors and seniors, we were pretty well free to travel any weekend we wanted to, but freshman, sophomore years, we weren't allowed on the road much.

12:09.299 --> 12:18.433
Do you remember going to your first midnight Yale practice?

12:19.122 --> 12:26.584
Yeah, they used to have midnight yellow practice across from Hart Hall.

12:28.389 --> 12:29.352
Over at the Grove?

12:30.766 --> 12:34.471
Or was it at the Y?

12:41.059 --> 12:52.673
See, we had, Hart was there close to the academic building, and so we may have had Yale practice sometime there.

12:52.653 --> 12:57.902
Of course, we were right across from the drill field too.

12:58.743 --> 13:01.908
That's where we built the bonfire was at the drill field.

13:01.968 --> 13:03.571
Did you help with the bonfire?

13:03.591 --> 13:03.992
Yes.

13:04.092 --> 13:06.135
What'd you do that freshman year?

13:06.155 --> 13:19.217
Well, first year I didn't have to do a lot because of football except I was one of the guards that made freshmen guard the bonfire.

13:19.197 --> 13:22.042
And it was right across from Hart Hall.

13:23.444 --> 13:36.667
And I was guarding, I think it was one morning, and that was the year that they tried to bomb a bonfire.

13:36.807 --> 13:37.829
Please describe that.

13:38.310 --> 13:42.437
Well, a UT student had

13:42.417 --> 13:51.409
ran an airplane and got an incendiary bomb out of water surplus, I guess, or something.

13:51.429 --> 14:02.904
And he flew over the drill field, dropped the bomb, missed the bomb farm, and he hit the property now where the MSC is.

14:03.085 --> 14:04.847
MSC, that was vacant then.

14:05.536 --> 14:10.088
MSC wasn't built until about 50 I don't think.

14:11.010 --> 14:14.119
So in 48 that was a vacant field and he missed it.

14:14.139 --> 14:15.803
Did you all know this plane was coming?

14:16.084 --> 14:16.525
No.

14:17.028 --> 14:22.313
Were you aware of what it was doing when it did get there?

14:22.393 --> 14:24.155
Well, not really.

14:26.156 --> 14:31.521
Just the bomb made a little explosion.

14:32.923 --> 14:34.224
What kind of plane was it?

14:34.404 --> 14:35.125
My plane?

14:35.465 --> 14:38.808
A little old single-engine plane, best of my recognition.

14:39.108 --> 14:40.850
And did you all see it?

14:41.410 --> 14:42.792
Yeah.

14:43.072 --> 14:43.993
Daylight or dark?

14:44.833 --> 14:46.495
I was thinking it was in the morning.

14:47.960 --> 14:50.627
Best I remember.

14:50.647 --> 14:51.891
And what was the reaction?

14:54.438 --> 14:57.145
Oh, back in those days, everything was good bull.

14:57.987 --> 14:59.592
We didn't worry about it.

14:59.612 --> 15:02.239
Nobody went to Austin to try to pay him back, did they?

15:02.489 --> 15:25.577
Oh, that was such a thing all the time of Bevo getting branded and losing his horns and putting, sowing oats on the field to TU or A&M.

15:26.857 --> 15:37.268
I was O.D., Officer of the Day, the night that some of my classmates stole the Baylor Bears.

15:38.589 --> 15:44.936
I just happened to be on duty that night, and that was kind of exciting.

15:44.956 --> 15:53.725
The car went to Baylor and got the Bear Cubs, and it was Lupo's car.

15:53.705 --> 16:02.317
They made it back to College Station, but those bears had torn in the car with all the pieces.

16:02.337 --> 16:05.121
They tore through from the trunk into the car.

16:05.662 --> 16:10.128
What did they do with the bears when they got them to College Station?

16:10.148 --> 16:14.734
I don't remember.

16:15.052 --> 16:17.659
I tried to go on with them to Houston or something.

16:17.679 --> 16:19.023
I don't know, it was a strange thing.

16:19.845 --> 16:23.335
Anyhow, we had a boy killed back in those days.

16:23.375 --> 16:25.922
The Baylor boys killed an Aggie.

16:27.218 --> 16:30.022
Gosh, I can't remember.

16:30.062 --> 16:34.268
It got pretty serious at one time.

16:35.831 --> 16:37.133
I can't remember.

16:37.473 --> 16:49.531
I just vaguely that at one time the Baylor students killed an A&M student during when trying to steal the Bears or something.

16:49.591 --> 16:52.235
It was back in that period.

16:52.255 --> 16:53.817
Baylor was always

16:55.535 --> 17:10.995
I mean, we didn't have much love for TU, but Baylor was, we thought, the dirtiest of all groups we ever played, I guess.

17:11.819 --> 17:18.111
In terms of traditional events, you remember going to your first Silver Taps?

17:19.573 --> 17:20.034
Yes.

17:21.837 --> 17:26.346
Taps was always a very moving thing.

17:27.828 --> 17:33.118
We had Silver Taps right next to our dorm, of course.

17:33.098 --> 17:39.888
It was a very moving affair.

17:40.529 --> 17:41.991
Did everybody take it seriously?

17:42.312 --> 17:43.694
Oh, yes, yes.

17:45.256 --> 17:53.008
Back on Bonfire, that freshman year, were they already doing it out of logs entirely?

17:53.108 --> 17:53.449
Oh, yeah.

17:54.971 --> 17:56.513
When I came, they were already doing it.

17:56.533 --> 17:58.937
Do you remember how far away the cutting area was?

17:59.575 --> 18:00.076
No.

18:02.139 --> 18:15.717
You know, those of us that were here then, even though we went cutting areas, we really didn't know where we were because we never left this campus.

18:15.958 --> 18:18.902
We never went to Brine.

18:19.282 --> 18:27.253
And if they loaded us up and took us somewhere out in the so-called country to cut logs, we wouldn't have known where we were because we had

18:27.233 --> 18:37.564
We had no geographical orientation or any type of contact with the citizens of Bryan or College Station.

18:37.983 --> 18:42.367
And the bonfire was what today is called teepee style?

18:43.208 --> 18:44.209
Yeah, yeah.

18:44.229 --> 18:45.771
And it was one stack?

18:46.952 --> 18:47.112
Yeah.

18:48.053 --> 18:51.376
The MSC was being built or?

18:52.698 --> 18:56.942
No, MSC, the year that bomb was dropped would have been in 48.

18:57.583 --> 18:58.944
So it wasn't yet even?

18:58.964 --> 19:01.126
It wasn't even thought of at that time.

19:01.146 --> 19:03.669
That was a big oasis.

19:03.689 --> 19:05.070
See, there wasn't but

19:05.050 --> 19:09.695
There wasn't but one place on campus to get a drink of water.

19:11.117 --> 19:11.437
YMCA?

19:11.917 --> 19:15.241
Cool water, and that was at the fountain at the YMCA.

19:16.562 --> 19:22.429
The dorms didn't have any water coolers.

19:24.471 --> 19:28.315
All the water came out of the tap, out of the sink.

19:28.335 --> 19:31.058
So did you go to the Y often?

19:31.510 --> 19:41.525
Occasionally at night in the late spring or when it just got so hot that you wanted a drink of water.

19:42.046 --> 19:44.069
And nothing was air conditioned?

19:44.089 --> 19:44.329
No.

19:45.671 --> 19:52.041
Where did you and your buddies go during the day to kind of relax?

19:53.503 --> 19:56.047
Well, he didn't have any periods of relaxation.

19:56.427 --> 19:57.268
Did you go to them?

19:58.590 --> 20:00.994
Or was there a place you could go and kind of hide out?

20:00.974 --> 20:01.695
No.

20:02.656 --> 20:18.079
We had one little old place across from the core area called George's, a little wooden building, where if you had the money, you could go and get, maybe you could get, junior, senior, you could get a Coke or something.

20:19.040 --> 20:23.246
But you didn't have time to do anything.

20:23.306 --> 20:30.897
You started at 6, bugle and wake up at 6.

20:30.877 --> 20:34.221
went through chow.

20:34.322 --> 20:38.627
You had to go to chow, march to chow for breakfast and supper and dinner.

20:39.909 --> 20:41.631
And then you had your classes.

20:41.911 --> 20:47.379
And then as soon as you could get out of class every day, you had to be in some intramural program.

20:48.560 --> 20:50.823
Every day, I mean, you didn't have any.

20:50.843 --> 20:52.986
And then you had

20:52.966 --> 20:59.273
Oh, Saturday morning was, we went to class till noon on Saturday.

21:02.116 --> 21:12.767
And then that's because we could have drill and ceremonies on all day, all afternoon on Thursday.

21:12.927 --> 21:14.188
I can't remember.

21:15.250 --> 21:18.673
We had one half day set aside for drill.

21:19.674 --> 21:21.336
And then we had intermules

21:21.721 --> 21:35.139
every day, and then we had classes till noon on Saturday, which made, again, that kind of made it difficult to leave campus to go anywhere on weekends if you had classes.

21:35.159 --> 21:45.332
Did, as you look back on that first year, other than that injury, did you have any life-changing experiences?

21:46.392 --> 21:47.473
Oh, yes.

21:47.774 --> 21:51.899
That you look back on now and realize that was important, something happened that was important?

21:51.979 --> 21:52.480
Yes.

21:54.502 --> 21:59.548
Well, you know, it was pretty routine.

21:59.829 --> 22:02.392
Everything was always routine.

22:03.333 --> 22:15.488
But I had, in the fall, I had contracted the monk.

22:17.037 --> 22:24.046
And I was practicing football every day with the mumps.

22:24.907 --> 22:25.207
Wow.

22:25.948 --> 22:37.122
And we had a kind of a hospital at that time of antiquated

22:37.102 --> 22:43.873
hospital and I had a doctor here named Dr. Marsh for the campus.

22:45.075 --> 22:49.642
And so I would go, I had a big nod on the side of my head.

22:51.345 --> 22:57.355
So I'd go see Dr. Marsh every day and he'd put a heat lamp on my

22:58.060 --> 23:00.062
where I had the mumps.

23:00.122 --> 23:02.304
He didn't know it was mumps.

23:02.324 --> 23:04.446
He thought I'd got hurt in football.

23:05.527 --> 23:09.872
So I did that for a week or so.

23:11.854 --> 23:16.959
And one day we were to go and play a game on Saturday morning.

23:17.019 --> 23:19.721
I couldn't get out of bed.

23:20.202 --> 23:23.545
And they had put the heat on me

23:23.525 --> 23:27.892
practiced every day until the mumps had gone down on me.

23:27.912 --> 23:35.904
And they took me into, I couldn't get up, so they took me to Bryan to Dr. Grant.

23:36.105 --> 23:42.755
And he diagnosed my mumps across the room.

23:44.137 --> 23:47.963
And Dawg Dawson took me to Bryan that day.

23:47.943 --> 23:57.646
to a doctor and then they put me in a wheelchair and brought me back to campus, put me in the hospital and the quarantine area was on the second floor.

23:58.568 --> 24:00.653
That's also where the nurses lived.

24:02.540 --> 24:12.278
And so I was semi-conscious when I woke up.

24:12.478 --> 24:25.662
I had two veterinary students shaving my groin and making a sling and packed my testicles in ice.

24:26.283 --> 24:42.992
Mom Claghorn was the nurse or the head of the nurse, and she told me that I would probably need to transfer to Texas Women's University.

24:44.761 --> 24:51.889
And there was a beautiful little blonde-headed nurse that lived on that floor.

24:53.130 --> 24:55.392
And she'd come by to see me every night.

24:56.073 --> 25:03.761
And one night she came by with mistletoe and put it over my head.

25:05.123 --> 25:08.406
And there I am laying, I don't know,

25:08.386 --> 25:11.711
almost unconscious with my testicles and eyes.

25:12.412 --> 25:14.816
It was a strange phenomenon.

25:16.098 --> 25:22.509
But that was a memorable part of my first year here, I guess.

25:22.529 --> 25:33.887
Any character building sessions where somebody gave you advice or somebody turned you, changed your direction of where you were headed?

25:34.171 --> 25:41.840
No, we didn't have really much counseling or anything, academic or personal counseling of any kind.

25:43.001 --> 25:44.623
You just made your own way.

25:45.204 --> 25:47.286
Did you do okay academically that first year?

25:47.907 --> 25:50.851
Yeah, surprisingly enough.

25:51.471 --> 25:58.419
I was better than a B student.

25:58.780 --> 25:59.841
I don't know how.

26:00.698 --> 26:02.020
And then you went home.

26:02.080 --> 26:06.327
What did you do at home that summer after your freshman year?

26:07.529 --> 26:15.122
Well, I started to work when I was six years old.

26:18.668 --> 26:21.693
I got my Social Security card when I was six years old.

26:21.713 --> 26:26.301
The first year that they ever had Social Security, I guess, in 1936, 1937.

26:28.171 --> 26:30.974
And so I was used to working.

26:31.034 --> 26:34.378
I sold Lays on Journal and Saturday and Post.

26:35.860 --> 26:45.450
And won Salesman of the Year for that district as a six-year-old and got a desk.

26:46.552 --> 26:48.173
That was my prize.

26:48.334 --> 26:54.921
And my family and my children still have that desk.

26:55.357 --> 27:15.627
But anyhow, I worked, always worked, and from the time I was six up, and I worked at, when I was 14, I went to work in a service station, and this leads to your question.

27:15.607 --> 27:21.039
So I had to have a driver's license when I was 14 to work in a station.

27:21.059 --> 27:33.927
And then I worked in service stations on up until I went to college primarily, but I'd also learned how to do mechanical things naturally.

27:33.987 --> 27:35.691
And so I worked as a mechanic.

27:37.392 --> 27:56.280
I believe that first summer, or the first summer before I went, I can't remember because eventually I ended up working for Pure Oil and for Exxon and the field, roused about it and things like that on up in college.

27:56.941 --> 27:59.625
I can't remember the sequence or not.

27:59.665 --> 28:03.731
So that those summer jobs were not related to your future profession.

28:03.932 --> 28:05.193
Oh, no.

28:05.214 --> 28:06.235
They were just income.

28:06.215 --> 28:07.617
to make money.

28:08.138 --> 28:15.950
You didn't try to match what you were going to do, just where you get the best job or get a job.

28:17.553 --> 28:18.334
Depression.

28:19.676 --> 28:30.793
Back here on campus, what extracurricular activities did you get involved in beginning with your sophomore year and then on?

28:32.256 --> 28:33.758
Oh, I was...

28:35.341 --> 28:49.783
I was, as I say, I was an athletic officer for my outfit, which meant every day being involved in an athletic program of some kind, an intramural program.

28:51.145 --> 28:55.070
And I was, you didn't have a lot of organization.

28:55.090 --> 28:57.875
I was in the Beaumont Hometown Program.

28:58.576 --> 29:00.859
What did that Beaumont Hometown Club do?

29:00.839 --> 29:08.309
Oh, it seemed like it met once, twice a semester or something like that.

29:09.511 --> 29:10.652
It didn't do anything.

29:10.873 --> 29:16.100
It just got, you know, didn't do anything.

29:16.140 --> 29:20.105
You saw your buddies and talked about rides back and forth?

29:20.125 --> 29:20.946
That's about it.

29:20.966 --> 29:27.896
It was just how you're going to get back and forth and what you're going to do.

29:28.937 --> 29:29.698
And I...

29:30.151 --> 29:37.116
became active in the college, university, college, 4-H program.

29:38.340 --> 29:41.612
Our future farmers, I can't remember which because

29:41.727 --> 29:49.419
being in vocational training or ag ed, I thought I should get involved.

29:49.439 --> 29:51.262
So, didn't have much.

29:52.184 --> 29:54.808
There just weren't any organization activity.

29:54.828 --> 29:57.772
We didn't have any fraternities or anything like that.

29:57.792 --> 30:04.002
What did you and your buddies think about the singing cadet, groups like singing cadets and the band and things like that?

30:04.563 --> 30:08.950
Well, the band was, singing cadets was not really

30:12.592 --> 30:13.513
much thought of.

30:13.614 --> 30:15.817
I don't even know where they existed at that time.

30:16.899 --> 30:25.872
But the band was an integral part, and you just had, you were just essentially your outfit.

30:25.952 --> 30:26.633
That was it.

30:26.714 --> 30:39.493
I mean, that was your whole social structure and everything else was your outfit, which normally had about 45, 50 people in it of four different classes.

30:40.013 --> 30:45.222
Were you all aware of any secret fraternities during that time?

30:46.344 --> 30:49.589
I became aware of that my senior year.

30:50.711 --> 30:58.765
One of my football cohorts had got arrested for being in the True Texans.

31:00.179 --> 31:01.682
What was their purpose?

31:01.702 --> 31:02.624
Do you have any idea?

31:02.644 --> 31:03.567
Never knew.

31:05.270 --> 31:15.032
They arrested several kids that year.

31:15.788 --> 31:24.592
And it was a big stir because A&M didn't believe fraternities and didn't want that type of thing.

31:24.873 --> 31:31.992
And you couldn't even wear your letter jackets or you couldn't wear anything distinguishing on campus.
