00:01.330 --> 00:05.157
with Mr. Fred Jaggi, Dr. Fred Jaggi. Today's date 
is February 7th, 1980. This is interview number

00:11.448 --> 00:13.832
two. This is Terry Anderson.

00:26.204 --> 00:29.328
This is our second interview with Dr. Fred Jackie. 
Today's date is Thursday, February 7, 1980. In

00:33.014 --> 00:45.592
1937,

00:33.014 --> 00:45.592
you were appointed head of the newly established 
Department of Veterinary and Hygiene, a post

00:33.014 --> 00:45.592
which you had until 1949. Why did they pick you? 
Well, I don't know. They'd never had anything like

00:50.298 --> 00:54.945
that, and they were expanding these. School of 
Veterinary Medicine at the time, and there was a

00:55.094 --> 01:07.510
need for

00:55.094 --> 01:07.510
a department they called Veterinary Hygiene. 
Whether that's a good term or not was

01:08.491 --> 01:12.316
questionable. What exactly does it mean?

01:17.703 --> 01:18.384
Well, that's it. What does it mean? They argued 
that.

01:26.498 --> 01:32.366
Lots of them said it didn't make any sense and 
whatnot. And finally, it evolved into veterinary

01:32.386 --> 01:36.512
public health. What they actually tried to, well, 
make it was veterinary subjects related to human

01:37.513 --> 01:53.755
health. For example? Like milk hygiene, meat 
hygiene, and that type of thing. And that disease

02:02.481 --> 02:06.506
is transmissible from animal to man. But the 
choice of veterinary hygiene seemed to not fit the

02:07.967 --> 02:15.476
bill. So eventually it was changed. Why did they 
affect you? I don't know. They were looking for

02:24.142 --> 02:26.807
somebody, and I was in practice. I guess they 
couldn't find anybody else. That's the only thing

02:31.538 --> 02:32.740
I know. How can you account for expansion during 
the Depression? 1937 was a bad year in American

02:39.375 --> 02:42.642
history. Well, I had nothing to do with the 
accounting for it. I was employed during the

02:49.505 --> 02:57.997
Depression, which is getting towards the tail end 
of the Depression. And I was in practice there in

02:59.719 --> 03:09.494
Beaumont and working for the city doing food 
hygiene work. So I guess they were scouting around

03:09.514 --> 03:12.237
for somebody. Could you Explain your duties as the 
head of the department, teaching and research and

03:15.140 --> 03:25.413
things like that. No, I didn't do any research. I 
did develop courses in milk hygiene, meat

03:29.638 --> 03:41.653
hygiene, and I did the meat inspection at the meats 
laboratory over in the animal husbandry

03:42.022 --> 03:46.848
department.

03:50.894 --> 03:51.574
How about teaching? I taught a little of 
everything. Of course, the two courses I

03:54.879 --> 04:11.100
mentioned, and then I also taught infectious 
diseases,

03:54.879 --> 04:11.100
large animal infectious diseases, and I'd fill in 
teaching non-infectious diseases, obstetrics,

04:11.300 --> 04:26.101
or what have you, for other departments where they 
had conflicts because they were short-handed.

04:27.543 --> 04:35.715
And sometimes they'd have conflicts or 
overloads, and I would teach some of these other

04:27.543 --> 04:35.715
courses. I'd assist with the operative surgery.

04:42.046 --> 05:00.363
because the classes had gotten pretty big by then, 
and Dr. Leonard was teaching surgery, and then in

04:42.046 --> 05:00.363
the laboratory when they were doing their 
laboratory work, I'd help with the surgery. I'd

05:00.383 --> 05:06.448
help him with his surgery so we could give more 
individual attention to the students. One man

05:08.970 --> 05:10.872
with about 30 men doing surgery could very well 
supervise, so I helped him with that. One other

05:19.340 --> 05:27.875
course I didn't mention, I also taught a course for 
agricultural students in animal hygiene.

05:30.900 --> 05:36.690
I have a question about your job as the head of 
Veterinarian Hygiene. You had that position from

05:37.075 --> 05:41.419
1937 to 1949, 12 years. What changes did you 
witness during those years in that department?

05:53.952 --> 06:05.243
Well, I guess one thing, we finally got a 
laboratory where we could do what laboratory work

05:53.952 --> 06:05.243
we needed to do with meat and milk, hygiene, and 
outside of that,

06:06.691 --> 06:27.155
during the war and after the war, since we went 
year-round,

06:06.691 --> 06:27.155
didn't have too many changes, except we had to 
double up on our teaching. Every subject was

06:27.236 --> 06:35.145
taught every term, and consequently,

06:27.236 --> 06:35.145
we were too busy to do make too many changes. Well 
what about them thinking about changes as far as

06:38.442 --> 06:41.927
the course load? Did it increase or decrease? Or as 
far as the curriculum, were there new courses

06:43.930 --> 06:50.018
offered that hadn't been offered before? Or as far 
as new people being hired, was there an increase in

06:50.199 --> 06:57.389
faculty during those years under your direction? 
Oh yeah, not under my direction, no. But in the

06:59.912 --> 07:04.018
veterinary school there was an increase. 
departments were well divided up to make other

07:04.252 --> 07:11.743
departments. In other words, parasitology 
became a department, and it recently was part of

07:13.105 --> 07:22.840
another department. I've forgotten what they 
called it now, but the man that taught

07:24.442 --> 07:31.052
parasitology also taught

07:34.205 --> 07:52.087
histology and pathology and food hygiene, and 
then they divided the, divided it up, made it a

07:34.205 --> 07:52.087
department of parasitology, which took some of 
the load off of that.

07:59.275 --> 08:00.837
I was trying to think now, Anatomy stayed like it 
was, but they employed two, three more people, a

08:02.150 --> 08:25.713
couple more people, and

08:02.150 --> 08:25.713
pathology was pulled out into a department, and 
microbiology was pulled out into a department.

08:25.733 --> 08:26.794
Now, why were they? Why were these changes? Why 
were they? Yeah. Why did these changes come about?

08:32.508 --> 08:46.153
Because had more students, too many students, and 
had need for more faculty.

08:46.233 --> 08:47.255
And it was expansion. That's it. Now during of 
course 1941 and 1945, this nation was consumed in

08:50.885 --> 08:56.813
the Second World War. I was wondering what was it 
like being at Texas A&M, and especially in the

08:57.133 --> 09:05.864
School of Medicine during the Second World War? 
Well on campus, we had lots of lots of servicemen.

09:14.055 --> 09:18.661
They had, they were there for short periods of 
time. In other words, with the teaching them

09:21.125 --> 09:35.522
something on an intensive basis, and most of us in 
veterinary school had nothing to do with that. We

09:35.542 --> 09:46.955
did have some students that were, I've forgotten 
what they called it now, Student Army Training

09:35.542 --> 09:46.955
Corps, something of that nature. Different from 
the Corps of Cadets, huh? Yes, yes. and these were

09:51.668 --> 10:01.301
to go into the service as soon as they graduated, 
and we had some of them. Now, in the veterinary

10:02.963 --> 10:08.891
school, we did not have many in the Corps of Cadets. 
Most of them were

10:11.334 --> 10:21.388
non-military students, I guess you'd call them, 
because a good many of them were were older or

10:22.634 --> 10:31.365
didn't have time really to enter into a bunch of 
extracurricular activities. I shouldn't say

10:31.425 --> 10:49.468
extracurricular because military science 
wouldn't be, but most of them were, you might say,

10:31.425 --> 10:49.468
civilian students,

10:31.425 --> 10:49.468
and I don't know what else I can say about that.

10:58.139 --> 11:04.428
Did the living conditions decline in any way 
because of the war and because of the material

10:58.139 --> 11:04.428
needed for the war? No, it didn't affect the 
veterinary school much, any. How about the

11:09.755 --> 11:11.157
general funding? Was the support for the 
veterinarian school decreased and shifted other

11:11.477 --> 11:26.998
ways, or did you get a feeling that the 
administration thought that veterinarian

11:11.477 --> 11:26.998
medicine was now at least as important or as 
important as it had been before the war?

11:29.898 --> 11:55.500
Well, I think they,

11:29.898 --> 11:55.500
as it became more popular and more students or more 
individuals wanted to take veterinary medicine,

11:29.898 --> 11:55.500
I think they did become an awareness of the 
importance of veterinary medicine, or that it was

11:29.898 --> 11:55.500
more important than they had thought at one time.

11:57.590 --> 12:27.124
course it goes back a long ways where they used to 
talk about the farriers being the veterinarians

11:57.590 --> 12:27.124
and so on, and but it became a little more respected 
and

11:57.590 --> 12:27.124
recognized as time went on, and as the curriculum 
became more exact and not so broad and not just

12:27.982 --> 12:57.786
clinical

12:27.982 --> 12:57.786
subjects, but as I went into research and that sort 
of thing, became specialized

12:27.982 --> 12:57.786
in certain cases. like poultry diseases and 
things of that nature, why it did become better

12:58.323 --> 13:07.896
recognized.

13:10.759 --> 13:25.579
And because we had such a, well, it was a tough 
curriculum, it was respected to

13:10.759 --> 13:25.579
a large extent on that account.

13:28.529 --> 13:30.794
Beyond that, I don't know anything I can tell you. 
Okay, I was thinking about the Second World War and

13:31.736 --> 13:46.225
the effect that there must, the war itself must 
have had some effect or the immediate post-war

13:31.736 --> 13:46.225
situation must have had some effect on, on the 
School of Veterinary Medicine. Do you, do you

13:46.666 --> 13:48.951
think it did or?

14:00.203 --> 14:02.065
I don't know how to analyze that. Obviously, it did 
have some effect because the men, as they

14:03.687 --> 14:27.612
graduated, most of them got commissions and went 
into the service, and then a lot of those finally

14:03.687 --> 14:27.612
served their

14:03.687 --> 14:27.612
years in the service and reached retirement and 
came back out, some of them to teach and some of them

14:28.655 --> 14:42.148
to go into other lines of work that they had become 
proficient in in the service. So, it had its

14:43.890 --> 14:45.892
effect. I don't know that I could put my finger on it 
and say it affected this in such and such a way, but

14:47.373 --> 14:57.683
certainly in the case of

15:00.548 --> 15:18.355
the Department of Veterinary Hygiene, it had lots 
of effect because the veterinarians that went

15:00.548 --> 15:18.355
into the service, a big part of them, were

15:00.548 --> 15:18.355
hygienists.

15:20.618 --> 15:30.032
And then they came out and a lot of them, while they 
were in the service, got a Masters of Public

15:20.618 --> 15:30.032
Health, and some even beyond that, and so there 
became an awareness of the importance of the

15:30.687 --> 15:43.202
veterinarian as far as food hygiene was 
concerned. So it had an effect on this department

15:45.024 --> 15:51.492
in that respect.

15:54.836 --> 15:58.500
Now probably in other departments it wasn't as 
noticeable.

16:01.838 --> 16:23.829
In 1936, right before you came here, in order to get 
into Veterinarian Medicine, School of

16:01.838 --> 16:23.829
Veterinarian Medicine, one needed 15 hours of 
pre-professional work, and in 1975 that was

16:01.838 --> 16:23.829
increased to 66 hours of pre-professional work. 
Why is that? Why were the requirements so small,

16:27.826 --> 16:34.195
and now why are they so much larger?

16:39.482 --> 16:57.647
I guess it's because of the development of more 
research, the things that have caused these

16:39.482 --> 16:57.647
subjects to become more technical, and because 
medicine, knowledge of medicine has increased in

16:59.551 --> 17:15.108
the last 20 years to the extent that it takes more 
training to fit into the niche. And has this

17:17.210 --> 17:28.562
increase in requirements to get into the School of 
Vet and Medicine had, have you seen any difference

17:17.210 --> 17:28.562
between the students, or does it make better 
students, or? Do you have any idea on that? Does it

17:33.118 --> 17:34.680
make better veterinarians? Is it worthwhile? 
Well, it should. All I can say is it should. Bear in

17:40.068 --> 17:43.994
mind that I've been out of the field for 15 years. 
Yeah, of course. And there's been tremendous

17:45.837 --> 17:57.334
strides since I retired from college veterinary 
medicine. And consequently, those men are

17:58.512 --> 18:06.660
definitely better trained than those before 
them. So,

18:08.221 --> 18:26.578
well, there's been, I know when I first

18:08.221 --> 18:26.578
came to the college there,

18:28.027 --> 18:56.312
Practically all the drugs we used were just basic 
drugs, and finally sulfanilamides came on, and

18:28.027 --> 18:56.312
then antibiotics, and all that type of thing has 
had a tremendous influence on what and how you

18:28.027 --> 18:56.312
teach.

18:58.233 --> 19:22.013
In other words, we used to use arsenic in one form or 
another for this and that and the other, and most of

18:58.233 --> 19:22.013
those basic drugs now that were a lot of mineral, a 
lot of plant extracts, have been replaced by other

18:58.233 --> 19:22.013
things, maybe synthetics in some cases.

19:25.756 --> 19:40.611
and there's been tremendous strides in the 
knowledge of surgery and orthopedics and that

19:25.756 --> 19:40.611
sort of thing. So, they have to be better trained. 
Now, whether as individuals they're any better is

19:46.757 --> 19:55.105
something else, but at least their training is 
much better than it used to be. Now, during your

19:58.474 --> 20:18.213
almost 30 years at the College of Veterinary 
Medicine, did you feel during that time, if you can

19:58.474 --> 20:18.213
reflect on this, that the students, the incoming 
first-year students, were better students, more

19:58.474 --> 20:18.213
knowledgeable students than those in the 1930s? 
Well, yes, because we got to the point where we

20:19.494 --> 20:25.480
screened them. And then it became more or less 
competitive. We had more applicants than we could

20:30.536 --> 20:48.654
take, and so we'd interview them, and in various 
ways we would rank them, and consequently a lot of

20:30.536 --> 20:48.654
them never got in. The ones we thought

20:50.175 --> 20:54.960
were not up to par. What was the criteria for 
ranking these students and, for example, in the

20:55.447 --> 21:01.274
interview? Well, a big part of it was their 
pre-veterinary record. Yeah. And then the rest,

21:11.386 --> 21:22.399
we tried to try to determine background and desire 
or why they wanted veterinary medicine, and the

21:22.919 --> 21:46.165
type of practice they wanted to go into, and

21:22.919 --> 21:46.165
then, let's say, just

21:22.919 --> 21:46.165
opinion of the selection committee. Each one, 
each one would, would rank them. and then you'd get

21:53.530 --> 21:58.557
a composite, and here you'd come up with a figure. 
Did you think that system worked well? Yes, it did

22:02.904 --> 22:04.366
at that time. It's been changed a lot since then. In 
what way? I don't know. All I know is it's been

22:11.256 --> 22:12.918
changed a lot. See, I haven't had any contact with 
it. In 1962, before you retired, 180 students

22:20.834 --> 22:28.482
applied for vet school, and today somewhere 
around 600 students are applying for vet school.

22:28.522 --> 22:33.587
There seems to be a great new interest in becoming a 
veterinarian. Why do you think that is? Do you have

22:36.991 --> 22:38.232
any opinions on that? Well, I think probably for 
one thing, as we got more graduates, out into the

22:51.091 --> 23:18.027
field, and because of numbers, and we feel they 
were all good men, and had more influence in their

22:51.091 --> 23:18.027
community that

22:51.091 --> 23:18.027
lots of boys or girls or lots of students, let's 
call them, thought it was fascinating. that the

23:19.829 --> 23:23.396
profession was fascinating, and they wanted to go 
into it. Now it used to be that practically all of

23:24.899 --> 23:33.515
them went into large animal practice, and then the 
small animal was sidelined. Now there's a

23:34.998 --> 23:43.153
predominance of small animal practitioners 
where they can live in the city and have lots of

23:44.618 --> 23:50.607
conveniences that the large animal practitioner 
didn't have in the small community.

23:53.352 --> 23:59.541
And of course the

23:53.352 --> 23:59.541
passing of the horse had a lot to do with it.

24:02.506 --> 24:12.381
So there's been lots of influences of that nature, 
but I think as the government has had lots to do with

24:13.880 --> 24:16.262
promoting veterinary medicine. In what way? 
Well, they had moving pictures that would

24:17.683 --> 24:41.625
promote the profession and then they became the 
old Bureau of Animal Industries grew and grew and

24:17.683 --> 24:41.625
grew and they had these animal disease research 
facilities like Plum Island and the one in Iowa and

24:42.027 --> 24:44.270
whatnot. So, it's just a question of people 
becoming better acquainted with what the

24:46.072 --> 24:56.185
profession had to offer.

25:00.451 --> 25:08.541
And I think a lot of it, too, is that they feel like 
when they graduate they're going to be

25:00.451 --> 25:08.541
independent. Yeah. They won't be working for 
General Electric or the telephone company or

25:12.267 --> 25:23.005
something like that, but they'll be out 
independent and everybody likes independence. I

25:24.868 --> 25:27.853
think that's a big part of it too. The first woman 
came, the first woman student came to Texas A&M

25:27.873 --> 25:36.688
School of Vet Medicine at 1963, right before you 
retired, and now they comprise about one-third of

25:37.175 --> 25:43.040
the student body. I was wondering what your 
feelings were when the first woman came. What did

25:51.068 --> 25:52.049
you think of that? Do you remember? No, I remember, 
I remember her, and

25:55.352 --> 26:05.241
what was her name? I don't remember. I've got it 
written down, but I don't know. She was a very

26:09.350 --> 26:19.624
attractive, black-headed girl, married, and I 
think went into practice with her husband in

26:09.350 --> 26:19.624
Lubbock. I believe that's right. But anyway, I 
never had her in class, and

26:21.166 --> 26:33.743
I don't know, it

26:21.166 --> 26:33.743
was kind of strange to me. that would have women 
wanting to practice veterinary medicine, and

26:34.330 --> 26:46.568
some of them go into large animal practice, which 
is pretty hard for me to understand. Of course,

26:47.770 --> 27:01.030
they want equal rights now, and apparently 
they'll have to register for the draft like

26:47.770 --> 27:01.030
everybody else, so if they want equal rights, 
they'll have to pay penalties.

27:04.655 --> 27:16.199
What was the general faculty, do you remember what 
the general faculty response to admitting women

27:04.655 --> 27:16.199
was back in the early 1960s?

27:20.488 --> 27:25.819
What did you and your colleagues think about 
having women students?

27:30.997 --> 27:35.062
I don't think we resented it too much. We thought it 
was strange that they'd want to take veterinary

27:35.683 --> 27:47.619
medicine, but if they wanted it, I don't think we 
resented it. In other words, you don't think there

27:47.639 --> 27:49.962
was really much decision? No. Not much dissent.

27:58.385 --> 28:13.202
because and then it was just what two or three came 
along there and didn't amount to much, but now I

27:58.385 --> 28:13.202
guess it's uh they just take their knocks along 
with the with the boys. Do you know, I haven't been

28:15.545 --> 28:26.518
able to find out much information about this, I 
know that the first women came in 1963, but how'd

28:15.545 --> 28:26.518
they make the decision to allow them to enter? That 
I don't know. I don't know where I can talk to you

28:28.693 --> 28:31.417
about that. I don't really know that either. I 
guess

28:33.360 --> 28:46.658
about that time, about that time they removed the 
restrictions of taking women into A&M. It became

28:47.279 --> 28:49.822
coeducational. So I guess it just had to be part of 
that. Now that's just my opinion. I don't know that

28:57.432 --> 29:08.345
that's really the case, but if the university 
wanted to go co-educational, veterinary

28:57.432 --> 29:08.345
medicine couldn't say no. What did you think of the 
quality of these first women students? They were

29:13.792 --> 29:14.333
good. As far as I know, as I say, I didn't have- 
Didn't you ever have, I mean, two years later you

29:14.593 --> 29:22.382
resigned, so you didn't have a woman in any class? 
No, I didn't have anything but seniors. Okay,

29:25.983 --> 29:27.224
okay, right. And consequently, they got up to meet 
this first one, I think graduated the next year.

29:37.893 --> 29:40.035
66? Yeah. I believe.

29:46.820 --> 29:55.888
A woman in a previously all-male setting must have 
had some impact on the School of Veterinary

29:46.820 --> 29:55.888
Medicine. Well, it wasn't apparent. There wasn't 
enough of them while I was out there for it to be

30:00.570 --> 30:05.495
apparent.

30:19.949 --> 30:27.917
Okay, I'd like to, now that we're talking about 
women, I'd like to switch to another topic, and

30:19.949 --> 30:27.917
that is concerning blacks in veterinary 
medicine. We have a number of blacks on campus

30:31.918 --> 30:38.346
today, and I'm rather surprised, well, I'd like 
your opinion on this. I don't want to

30:38.366 --> 30:39.528
editorialize. I'd like your opinion on this. Why 
are there so few blacks in veterinary medicine? Do

30:48.660 --> 30:49.962
you have an idea on them? I had never thought about 
it. No.

30:59.048 --> 31:05.156
At one time, down at Prairie View, they had a 
department of veterinary medicine. And the head

31:06.898 --> 31:15.729
of that department down there was a good 
veterinarian and a fine man.

31:19.573 --> 31:28.144
But the blacks would go there and just, they'd have 
a few courses in veterinary medicine and they

31:19.573 --> 31:28.144
didn't get a degree. And,

31:28.428 --> 31:46.255
of course,

31:28.428 --> 31:46.255
schools were segregated then,

31:28.428 --> 31:46.255
and I can't answer your question. We didn't have 
one when I was out there. I know, I know. It's a

31:49.259 --> 31:54.908
difficult question, and today I don't know if 
there's any blacks enrolled at all. Veterinary

31:56.035 --> 31:57.136
medicine? I don't know if there are. There might be 
one or two. They did have some. Uh-huh. They did

32:01.741 --> 32:03.143
have some. Shortly after I retired, I know they had 
some out there. Now, I think a lot of that, this is

32:08.769 --> 32:20.862
not for publication, I think a lot of that was due to 
insistence by the NAACP that Negroes go to A&M and

32:21.837 --> 32:30.056
go into the veterinary school and invade every 
area in the country. Now, whether they could cut

32:30.978 --> 32:39.458
the mustard or not, the students were something 
else,

32:30.978 --> 32:39.458
but they did push them.
