WEBVTT

00:02.545 --> 00:09.831
The majority of the Corps, I think it would have been kind of a split type situation.

00:09.871 --> 00:18.859
I don't think it would have been like one way or another that I think the integration of black students in the school, I think that would have flown.

00:19.120 --> 00:20.461
I don't think that would have been a problem.

00:21.782 --> 00:24.504
Females in the school, that may have been a little different situation.

00:24.905 --> 00:31.050
That could have had a little harder role to swallow.

00:33.258 --> 00:39.225
The other one, a non-compulsory corps, I think we saw it coming.

00:39.725 --> 00:41.387
I mean, we knew it had to happen.

00:42.008 --> 00:44.290
I mean, there wasn't any other way.

00:44.350 --> 00:48.355
I mean, the school had to change in some way or another, and that was the way to do it.

00:50.137 --> 01:01.189
Do you by chance remember a gathering in the MSC hallway at the top of the stairway?

01:01.912 --> 01:06.558
on the day before the board, then we called it the board of directors.

01:06.578 --> 01:08.721
They're going to have a meeting to vote on this.

01:09.502 --> 01:23.920
And there was an old guy from the class of 99 or something who was going to try to lead the argument against all these changes, and he asked for the senior class leaders to join him at that.

01:24.727 --> 01:25.568
I don't recall that.

01:25.668 --> 01:33.556
And I could have been gone already because that was, see the study was completed and I don't think they voted on it at the time that I was studying.

01:33.576 --> 01:34.837
It might have been the next year.

01:34.857 --> 01:35.137
Yeah.

01:35.157 --> 01:39.301
I remember the one guy, the old guy that was always here was Pinky.

01:40.382 --> 01:46.568
And I mean he worked for the student center and he was there and he was quite a fellow.

01:46.749 --> 01:50.212
You know everybody knew him and it was like Lupo.

01:50.232 --> 01:51.173
Everybody knew Lupo.

01:51.473 --> 01:55.139
Did you ever need to borrow money from Lupo?

01:55.480 --> 01:55.640
No.

01:56.241 --> 01:57.103
No, never did.

01:58.024 --> 02:00.869
Because he was always trustworthy, wasn't he?

02:00.889 --> 02:01.089
Oh, yeah.

02:01.129 --> 02:02.051
And he always helped you.

02:02.071 --> 02:02.392
Oh, yes.

02:02.512 --> 02:04.715
He was always known to do that.

02:04.856 --> 02:08.762
And our first year old practice every year, he would be there waiting for us.

02:08.782 --> 02:10.325
He'd be up there with the other leaders.

02:10.385 --> 02:13.891
And, of course, he got a plug-in for his place, you know.

02:13.971 --> 02:15.935
And everybody would go to Lupo's, you know.

02:16.015 --> 02:17.397
Everybody would go to Lupo's, you know.

02:18.170 --> 02:22.154
The MSC, what role did it play in student lives?

02:22.455 --> 02:25.578
I think it was an important role for us because we had no other place to go.

02:26.479 --> 02:29.402
It was the same as Guyon Hall I think played an important role for us.

02:30.163 --> 02:32.485
Athletics played a very important role.

02:32.505 --> 02:43.637
I mean it was like a treat, you know, because football games, you know, and basketball, I mean Charlie Raleigh would be full, you know.

02:44.005 --> 02:47.028
And so those were very important.

02:47.048 --> 02:55.919
The student center, I spent a lot of time in there studying, I spent a lot of time in there shooting the bull with my buddies, drinking coffee, those kind of things.

02:55.939 --> 02:58.962
Did you get involved in any MSC?

02:59.162 --> 02:59.663
Activities?

02:59.703 --> 03:00.824
Didn't have that many.

03:02.106 --> 03:08.713
I was more involved like in the marketing society, and I was involved with the San Antonio NM Club.

03:09.115 --> 03:11.719
What did the San Antonio A&M Club do?

03:11.739 --> 03:22.977
The San Antonio A&M Club, when you start at the school year you'd go out and find all the students that came in from San Antonio and you'd go and recruit them to join the San Antonio A&M Club.

03:23.137 --> 03:24.399
And we would meet once a month.

03:25.941 --> 03:28.305
And the idea behind it is that we'd keep

03:29.703 --> 03:39.638
contact with home, keep contact with the buddies that were there because if they knew you were from San Antonio, they would drop handles with you and all that kind of stuff.

03:41.480 --> 03:49.893
You'd have meetings of what's going on, how we could help each other, planning activities like a Christmas party.

03:49.913 --> 03:53.398
We had a Christmas party back in San Antonio.

03:53.733 --> 03:56.036
end of the year party and those kind of things.

03:56.136 --> 04:00.881
And we had, San Antonio was fortunate enough, they had Aggie Club there, the Aggie San Antonio NEM Club.

04:01.402 --> 04:02.904
So we were always allowed to use that.

04:03.304 --> 04:06.948
So we would, during Christmas they'd give us one night that we could use it.

04:07.970 --> 04:16.860
And we'd go there and they would have maybe a band and food and it would be a social event.

04:17.040 --> 04:18.282
And you'd arrange travel.

04:18.782 --> 04:21.225
Oh yeah.

04:21.509 --> 04:24.773
Actually the travel didn't necessarily have to be with people from San Antonio.

04:25.594 --> 04:30.882
If you, and maybe they weren't members, but you would always, they had a place you could post that you needed a ride.

04:31.402 --> 04:36.209
But if you knew somebody from San Antonio that was going home, yeah, that would be, that would be to an advantage.

04:36.229 --> 04:39.433
You'd give them a buck going, a buck coming, first guess.

04:39.473 --> 04:41.636
And that was the way it worked.

04:41.976 --> 04:44.299
Did you ever get sick and go to the campus hospital?

04:44.380 --> 04:45.962
Oh yes, my sophomore year.

04:46.082 --> 04:46.943
Describe that.

04:47.918 --> 04:49.721
They had a flu epidemic.

04:50.782 --> 04:53.807
And I mean we were all falling like flies.

04:54.768 --> 05:00.678
And it was like Monday I think it was, maybe a Tuesday.

05:01.138 --> 05:01.919
I was real sick.

05:02.781 --> 05:04.063
I had a real high temperature.

05:04.143 --> 05:06.266
I don't remember what the temperature was.

05:07.308 --> 05:11.154
And actually freshmen were the ones that helped me.

05:12.876 --> 05:15.360
Freshmen that were next to my hole I was banging on the wall.

05:15.340 --> 05:19.006
They came over, and I asked him if they had any aspirin or something.

05:19.627 --> 05:20.468
He's trying to be nice.

05:21.269 --> 05:22.651
So he said, sir, you're burning up, sir.

05:24.154 --> 05:27.439
Maybe we should get you to the campus hospital.

05:27.919 --> 05:28.781
So they did.

05:28.801 --> 05:29.642
They took me over there.

05:30.303 --> 05:32.286
And the doctor put me in the hospital.

05:32.789 --> 05:36.076
I mean, the beds were all, I mean, it was full.

05:36.877 --> 05:38.761
And it wasn't bad.

05:38.821 --> 05:42.509
I mean, it's not as bad as everybody claimed it was, you know.

05:42.529 --> 05:44.292
I thought they treated us fairly well.

05:44.332 --> 05:45.094
They kept you clean.

05:45.114 --> 05:46.457
They made sure you got fed.

05:47.338 --> 05:53.110
And I remember it was Thursday night, and I told the

05:53.090 --> 06:02.710
the doctor, I need to be out of here tomorrow because I have a big test in marketing and that prof will take, we cannot have any absences.

06:03.472 --> 06:12.651
He has told us that if we miss one of his major quizzes that he'll make us write a term paper that will be harder than a thesis and I'm not in a position to do that.

06:12.631 --> 06:16.998
So I need to get out of here tomorrow and take that test."

06:17.158 --> 06:19.242
He says, well are you ready for it?

06:19.282 --> 06:22.487
And I said, sir, whether I'm ready for it or not I have to do it.

06:23.148 --> 06:25.852
So these freshmen brought me some old quizzes.

06:27.375 --> 06:30.200
And so that Thursday night my temperature was down.

06:30.600 --> 06:33.805
He said, well I'll tell you what, I'm going to let you out, and it was raining.

06:34.527 --> 06:39.094
He said, but you make sure you have your helmet liner, and we didn't call it helmet liner.

06:39.479 --> 06:40.461
They call it Pispat.

06:41.142 --> 06:53.041
And your poncho and your fatigues, the uniform that you need to wear tomorrow, and you can go take the test and either you come back here or you go home.

06:54.664 --> 06:55.225
So I'll go home.

06:56.246 --> 07:00.613
So he says, okay, when you check out you're going to sign this and you're going to tell us so you're going to go.

07:01.014 --> 07:02.837
So anyway I signed out.

07:03.273 --> 07:08.664
and I go to the business library, and I'm sitting there, and I'm reading all these old tests.

07:08.724 --> 07:19.165
And then my roommate came in, and he had been by the hospital to see me, and he said, look, well, actually one of my roommates was another business major.

07:19.626 --> 07:21.770
He came by and said, look, study these right here real quick.

07:21.790 --> 07:23.273
He says, you've got about an hour and a half.

07:23.793 --> 07:25.915
You know, you probably hadn't seen it.

07:25.935 --> 07:29.960
So I studied these tests and I said, oh man, I'm going to go in there, I'm going to really bust this one.

07:30.601 --> 07:35.867
So I go in there and behold, God was looking out for me.

07:36.468 --> 07:49.142
I sit down and he gives us a test and it was almost identical to one of the ones that I had looked at that my other sophomore buddy had brought to me from the dorm.

07:49.612 --> 07:51.655
And I mean almost, almost.

07:52.035 --> 07:54.419
And I said, oh man, thank you God.

07:55.079 --> 07:58.925
And so anyway, yeah, that was my experience there.

07:59.365 --> 07:59.946
I had a flu.

08:00.146 --> 08:01.368
Who was the doctor?

08:01.769 --> 08:02.550
Who was the head?

08:02.570 --> 08:03.851
Oh God, I don't know.

08:04.773 --> 08:06.114
I could not tell you.

08:07.897 --> 08:12.723
Then Guyon Hall, what did y'all, what all went on happened at Guyon Hall?

08:12.743 --> 08:16.108
Oh Guyon Hall was our weekend movies.

08:17.219 --> 08:19.466
three or four movies during the night.

08:19.506 --> 08:26.147
We'd go over there and buy popcorn, soft drinks, sit there and watch three or four movies in the evening.

08:26.207 --> 08:28.615
On Saturdays normally was the night that we would go over there.

08:29.056 --> 08:30.942
Not much with a date.

08:31.124 --> 08:32.987
No, no, no, not at all.

08:33.227 --> 08:35.650
And you all made noise during the movie, is that right?

08:35.670 --> 08:39.295
Oh yeah, we raise hell and make remarks about it.

08:39.315 --> 08:41.779
By and large, was it almost all students?

08:42.199 --> 08:56.980
Oh yes, yes, I'd say the majority were all, and the majority of those were all core, core students, and Guyon Hall was, that was one of our meeting halls for the inclement weather drill where they would take us to if we had

08:56.960 --> 09:01.709
They would show these movies on how great the Air Force was and that kind of stuff.

09:02.731 --> 09:05.776
I remember a certain incident when we were seniors.

09:07.620 --> 09:12.088
The executive officer of Squadron 7, I was the executive officer of Squadron 2.

09:12.769 --> 09:13.851
We lived next door to each other.

09:13.871 --> 09:15.053
We were both from San Antonio.

09:15.093 --> 09:18.259
He used to ride with me all the time back to San Antonio.

09:18.239 --> 09:25.415
So it was raining, and we go in there, and I told him, Henry, let's do this.

09:26.377 --> 09:35.117
Once they turned the lights out, because the guy in the hall had like these curtains and like openings, and so I told him, once they turned the lights out,

09:35.570 --> 09:47.021
I'm going to sit close to where the opening is, crawl over the wall, go out and sneak out the side door, and we can get out of here.

09:47.042 --> 09:48.663
We don't watch this stuff."

09:48.683 --> 09:49.824
He said, that's a good idea.

09:49.904 --> 09:52.407
So they marched our office over there.

09:52.427 --> 10:03.518
So I'm sitting there, and so all of a sudden I just crawl over, go to the door, open the door slightly, trying not to get any light in there.

10:03.987 --> 10:10.674
And so I get out, and then all of a sudden he's behind me, and he opens the damn door.

10:11.435 --> 10:13.377
And, of course, the Bulls saw it.

10:14.018 --> 10:22.507
So we're running down the Guyon Hall, which was where Rudder Tower was, across to the dorm area, to the quad over there where we lived.

10:23.187 --> 10:27.252
And so I hear one of the officer Bulls, Captain Allen.

10:27.292 --> 10:30.055
I remember he was an Air Force Academy graduate.

10:30.475 --> 10:31.476
Oh, man, what a guy.

10:32.197 --> 10:33.218
Anyway.

10:33.772 --> 10:46.026
I ran actually into my dorm and he's running behind me and instead of running into the end of the hall I ran around and so they couldn't see what dorm I went into.

10:46.529 --> 10:47.731
And he did the same thing.

10:48.612 --> 10:55.483
So I go into my room, my room was right on the corner, and so I go to my room and I heard them.

10:56.284 --> 10:57.807
I know they went in somewhere in here.

10:58.067 --> 10:59.489
They're looking for us.

10:59.509 --> 11:05.719
So I hide in the closet and I'm waiting and waiting and waiting until I hear no noise.

11:05.699 --> 11:11.440
What my buddy did, he went upstairs to his room and he let this door open.

11:11.641 --> 11:11.842
Uh-oh.

11:12.645 --> 11:13.930
And he turned on his radio.

11:14.271 --> 11:14.934
Uh-oh.

11:14.954 --> 11:16.419
So he was changing clothes.

11:16.439 --> 11:16.941
So he caught it.

11:18.389 --> 11:19.310
So they let him go.

11:19.370 --> 11:22.654
They said, okay, Monday you come over to Trigon and we'll take care of you.

11:23.716 --> 11:30.044
So, okay, Monday, Henry goes over to the Trigon and they campused him for the rest of the semester.

11:30.204 --> 11:32.467
He had bull ring every weekend.

11:33.909 --> 11:35.311
And this was in the spring.

11:36.031 --> 11:37.573
And it was like April.

11:38.074 --> 11:39.496
So we only had about a month to go.

11:40.517 --> 11:42.099
So we're seniors, keep in mind.

11:43.181 --> 11:46.945
So we started getting those April showers and the rains and all that kind of stuff.

11:46.965 --> 11:48.227
We'd go to the mess hall and

11:48.933 --> 12:01.771
And I remember Henry sitting there in the mess hall, and he tells the bull that was in charge of bullring, he tells him, sir, are we going to have bullring today?

12:03.193 --> 12:04.875
And he'd say it was right after drill.

12:04.995 --> 12:08.540
He says, yes, bring your galoshers.

12:10.403 --> 12:15.430
So he drilled every weekend, the weekend of the senior ring dance.

12:15.410 --> 12:16.251
He had to go.

12:17.113 --> 12:17.814
He couldn't get out.

12:18.054 --> 12:18.796
They made him go.

12:19.797 --> 12:21.720
Probably the only damn senior that was there.

12:22.502 --> 12:26.228
So we had dates for the senior ring dance.

12:26.568 --> 12:33.199
And so we're all, we had three girls that came up from San Antonio and they all were staying at

12:33.922 --> 12:34.603
at a hotel.

12:34.723 --> 12:38.109
We didn't have many hotels here, but we had made the reservation way ahead of time.

12:38.129 --> 12:47.243
But anyway, so he's out there drilling and we're over there at the hotel having a good time, you know, swimming and all that kind of stuff.

12:47.303 --> 12:50.228
And so he's like, I can't believe this, you know.

12:50.248 --> 12:54.835
So anyway, that was one of the stories I guess.

12:54.915 --> 12:58.140
And to this day I still see him every once in a while.

12:58.508 --> 13:06.355
Do you remember any famous people coming to Guyon Hall to speak or performers?

13:06.676 --> 13:11.320
We had this orchestra that came.

13:13.762 --> 13:14.443
What's the name?

13:14.483 --> 13:16.545
They're not even in existence anymore.

13:16.585 --> 13:17.586
They're old.

13:17.606 --> 13:18.847
Guy Lombardo?

13:18.867 --> 13:19.868
It was something like that.

13:19.888 --> 13:20.589
Dorsey Brothers?

13:20.609 --> 13:21.490
No, it wasn't Dorsey.

13:21.750 --> 13:23.011
I think Bob Hope was here.

13:23.031 --> 13:24.833
Bob Hope?

13:24.853 --> 13:25.073
Yeah.

13:25.711 --> 13:29.174
I'm trying to remember, I can't remember the name of the orchestra.

13:29.194 --> 13:32.978
I mean everybody, I didn't go to it, but it was a big event.

13:32.998 --> 13:37.783
During your four years, what about the religious activities on or around the campus?

13:37.803 --> 13:39.525
That's pretty much on your own.

13:39.605 --> 13:42.688
But I used to go to church every Sunday.

13:42.748 --> 13:43.228
Where did you go?

13:43.348 --> 13:43.649
At St.

13:43.689 --> 13:43.989
Mary's.

13:44.890 --> 13:45.230
Northgate?

13:45.250 --> 13:45.931
Yeah, Northgate.

13:45.951 --> 13:47.632
I used to walk there every Sunday morning.

13:47.893 --> 13:51.016
That was kind of my, I guess, chill out time.

13:51.436 --> 13:53.338
I've always been an early riser.

13:53.470 --> 14:02.216
Who would be, the congregation at the mass, would they be almost all students or were there lots of local residents?

14:02.296 --> 14:03.179
Mostly students.

14:03.440 --> 14:06.990
There was local residents, but there was a mixture of

14:07.510 --> 14:13.421
Corps people, civilian students, and probably residents too, but a lot of Corps, a lot of Corps.

14:13.601 --> 14:15.605
Was there a Sunday night activity?

14:15.805 --> 14:19.612
Every once in a while they would have it, not as a standard.

14:20.153 --> 14:21.536
They would have some functions.

14:22.117 --> 14:27.587
The Newman Club, they had the Newman Club, and that was another organization I was a member of, the Newman Club.

14:27.607 --> 14:28.168
Where did it meet?

14:28.503 --> 14:37.080
They had a little hall there that was across the street from the church, and I think that's probably either still there or they tore it down or built it up or whatever.

14:37.120 --> 14:38.804
And they've got a splendid week.

14:38.824 --> 14:38.924
Yeah.

14:38.944 --> 14:41.429
Oh, they built that one up a couple of years ago, yeah.

14:41.449 --> 14:43.373
Religious Emphasis Week, do you remember that?

14:44.990 --> 15:14.929
yeah yeah i remember that and there were there were events for catholics yes yes we we had uh we had events uh uh i guess being that like i think you know this is the truth in the four years that i was here i don't think i missed going to mass more than once or twice every sunday i would make sure and i went to that it was either the 8 30 or nine o'clock mess i can't remember but i would get up and you had to wear a uniform you couldn't do it any other way i mean they wouldn't they didn't allow you

15:15.196 --> 15:17.539
If you were a freshman, sophomore, you wore a uniform everywhere.

15:17.900 --> 15:20.304
Even a junior, a junior had to wear his uniform everywhere.

15:21.265 --> 15:22.907
Seniors had a little more flexibility.

15:23.248 --> 15:26.613
They could go places without, in civilian clothes, but.

15:26.813 --> 15:32.462
So that you went to Mass here as regularly or even more regularly than you had at home?

15:33.243 --> 15:35.646
No, no, because I would do the same thing at home.

15:35.686 --> 15:36.508
You wouldn't, okay.

15:36.528 --> 15:37.729
Because I went to Central Catholic, yeah, yeah.

15:38.050 --> 15:39.111
So as regular, okay.

15:39.132 --> 15:39.552
Yeah.

15:39.572 --> 15:42.857
Did the typical Aggie on campus go to?

15:45.267 --> 15:47.834
I'd say it was split, maybe 50-50.

15:49.338 --> 15:50.902
My roommate was a Presbyterian.

15:50.942 --> 15:53.709
He went to church every Sunday too.

15:54.030 --> 15:55.153
Sometimes we'd walk together.

15:56.096 --> 16:01.470
And as long as he, he got married when we were at the end of our junior year.

16:02.412 --> 16:06.740
And going into our senior year, he got married and married a girl from Texas.

16:07.702 --> 16:14.656
And so anyway, but we used to, we used to, I'd say about half the guys would go.

16:14.816 --> 16:17.040
The other half, probably not.

16:17.621 --> 16:23.052
And the student body, there was a wide diversity of religious groups.

16:23.072 --> 16:23.593
Oh yeah, yeah.

16:24.046 --> 16:26.609
Were there any international students that you remember?

16:27.150 --> 16:27.631
Very few.

16:27.751 --> 16:28.372
There were some.

16:29.113 --> 16:30.234
From where?

16:31.636 --> 16:33.799
Central America, South America, Mexico.

16:34.019 --> 16:42.810
And the reason I can testify to this, when I was, after I took those two years of Spanish, I thought, man, I'm pretty hot on this stuff, man, I'm really going.

16:43.551 --> 16:45.534
They had a public speaking course in Spanish.

16:46.655 --> 16:51.261
And so I was a junior, I think I was a senior already, maybe I was a senior already.

16:51.742 --> 16:52.703
Took it as an elective.

16:53.358 --> 17:00.151
And I'll go into the classroom, and there are 18 people in the classroom.

17:00.412 --> 17:02.376
It's a one-hour public speaking course.

17:03.097 --> 17:03.859
Met twice a week.

17:05.121 --> 17:12.796
And there were 16 students in there, and they were all from either Mexico, Central America, or South America.

17:12.817 --> 17:15.602
And there was one Anglo and myself.

17:15.582 --> 17:22.109
And I said, and so the Anglo guy sits next to me and I look at him and I said, I think we're going to be in trouble.

17:23.091 --> 17:28.997
And I had never, for a one hour course, I had never studied as hard as I did because I had to spend a lot of time.

17:29.318 --> 17:34.924
But the prof did, he came in and he said, okay this is a public speaking course in Spanish, you guys are already well aware of where you're at.

17:34.944 --> 17:36.986
So anyway what he did, he gave us assignments.

17:37.006 --> 17:37.767
Everybody had a turn.

17:38.768 --> 17:44.695
And so you did your presentation and you go to the lab and

17:44.911 --> 17:49.437
and review it to see how well you did and then he would grade you.

17:49.457 --> 17:52.300
And so, yeah.

17:53.141 --> 17:55.784
The student body in general were Texans?

17:57.647 --> 17:59.529
I'd say the majority, yes.

17:59.929 --> 18:00.310
Were they?

18:00.330 --> 18:02.733
We had some from New York that I can remember.

18:04.075 --> 18:10.142
California, my first sergeant from my freshman year was Bob Lee from Anaheim, California.

18:10.966 --> 18:15.532
And then we had some students from Mexico that were in the Corps.

18:15.572 --> 18:17.013
Very few, but we had some.

18:18.015 --> 18:25.784
And probably because of affiliation with the families and that type of situation, that's why they were in the Corps.

18:26.165 --> 18:29.088
Were they, would the general student body urban or rural?

18:34.835 --> 18:37.699
I think a lot of rural.

18:39.164 --> 18:43.510
A lot of them from small towns, you know, Gladewater, where the hell is that at?

18:45.713 --> 18:46.434
Rich and poor.

18:47.836 --> 18:48.397
Rich and poor?

18:48.757 --> 18:49.138
Oh yeah.

18:49.639 --> 18:52.382
Yeah, I think you've got to make sure, yeah.

18:52.803 --> 18:53.684
Rich and poor.

18:54.325 --> 19:01.415
Some kids that maybe their father had passed away and they were kind of existing on the Social Security they were getting, those kind of things would happen, yeah.

19:02.957 --> 19:07.163
Do you remember going to

19:07.801 --> 19:09.164
Silver Taps the first time?

19:09.204 --> 19:10.707
Yes.

19:11.188 --> 19:12.149
What was it like?

19:12.230 --> 19:16.638
Well, it was kind of like, okay, they had it there at the academic building.

19:16.718 --> 19:18.221
It's the same place I think they still have it.

19:19.003 --> 19:21.407
And it's kind of like you don't know what to expect.

19:21.487 --> 19:23.852
You're just told that

19:24.085 --> 19:33.674
you had an individual that passed away and so the instructions, they gave you the instructions, being a freshman, you know, you really didn't know.

19:33.774 --> 19:36.217
So they said, and we will enforce this.

19:36.457 --> 19:46.687
So at 10.30 at the end of the call of the quarters you would turn out all the lights and you would be able, that's the only time they'd allow you to go into civilian clothes.

19:46.707 --> 19:51.732
And you'd go over to the academic building, in front of the academic building, and they'd have a ceremony.

19:52.352 --> 19:53.113
It was kind of like

19:55.068 --> 20:02.625
you kind of like, that kind of made you feel like, God, you know, this is something that probably never experienced again in my life.

20:04.168 --> 20:06.293
This is like being, to me, like being in

20:06.644 --> 20:13.112
in the battlefield, you know, where one of your comrades dies and you're there to honor him.

20:13.313 --> 20:16.136
That's a feeling you had and you bonded.

20:16.156 --> 20:20.762
You know, everybody was very quiet going and no one spoke.

20:21.103 --> 20:24.006
And when it was over and no one spoke, you went back to the dorm.

20:24.687 --> 20:31.656
If you had called the quarters, I mean, if you wanted to stay up late to study, then you had to take a blanket, put it over your

20:31.636 --> 20:40.445
over your window, and you could stay up as late as you wanted to to study, but that blanket stayed there all night until the next morning.

20:40.585 --> 20:47.152
And you couldn't have any light at all during that period of time from the time they had it until the next morning.

20:47.172 --> 20:50.316
And there were never any pranks or bull about silver taps?

20:50.336 --> 20:51.056
Oh, no.

20:51.217 --> 20:52.498
That was serious business.

20:53.199 --> 20:59.145
Anybody would do anything out of, they'd probably die there because they'd be the next one.

20:59.632 --> 21:03.017
Do you remember Bonfire as a fish?

21:03.197 --> 21:04.539
Oh yes, yes.

21:05.120 --> 21:05.761
What did you do?

21:05.841 --> 21:06.862
It was a good experience.

21:06.922 --> 21:08.404
What was your task?

21:09.225 --> 21:11.248
Our assignment was to work out in the cutting area.

21:11.769 --> 21:12.951
Do you remember where it was?

21:13.431 --> 21:19.660
Oh God, it was out at Wellburn Road, out maybe 10 miles or whatever in the cutting area that they had.

21:20.341 --> 21:21.943
And what we did is

21:22.278 --> 21:31.328
our outfit was assigned to, of course, cutting trees, bringing them back to the stacking area when we throw them on these trailers.

21:32.209 --> 21:42.800
But the idea behind it was, well, that was what was good about it, and that's where we lost it, is that upperclassmen looked out for underclassmen.

21:44.001 --> 21:47.485
And your duty was X, and that was it.

21:48.606 --> 21:50.428
A junior had privilege of

21:51.387 --> 22:03.261
cutting a tree with an ax or with electric equipment or in the senior, actually, all they did was supervise.

22:03.461 --> 22:07.646
You know, they made sure that everybody was in good shape, made sure nobody got hurt.

22:08.427 --> 22:14.073
It was not a, what would you call it, it was a serious thing.

22:14.494 --> 22:15.415
It was a serious thing.

22:15.655 --> 22:20.601
About how long, in terms of days and weeks, about how long did you all work on it?

22:21.273 --> 22:24.036
About a month before we'd start working on it.

22:24.376 --> 22:29.741
And they'd start, you know, any spare time you had, you'd come back to the dorm.

22:29.761 --> 22:31.363
Now, that's one time you had to do one.

22:31.383 --> 22:39.351
Any spare time you had, you'd come back to the dorm, put on your fatigues, and they'd take you out to the cutting area, or they'd keep you out in the area where they were putting the logs up.

22:39.431 --> 22:46.318
But there was only certain outfits that were authorized to deal with stacking the

22:46.788 --> 22:48.931
setting up the bonfire, or engineering.

22:48.971 --> 22:52.215
There was an engineering office, and they did, I mean, they were very careful about that.

22:52.896 --> 22:56.500
You as a person, you didn't have any involvement in that.

22:56.520 --> 23:03.148
I mean, not even as a senior, because I wasn't in that type of an office, but... It was held on drill field?

23:04.210 --> 23:05.131
It was behind Duncan.

23:05.731 --> 23:06.312
Oh, behind Duncan.

23:06.332 --> 23:08.975
Behind Duncan, yeah.

23:08.995 --> 23:09.176
Okay.

23:09.196 --> 23:12.520
And was it one, was it one... It was one tier.

23:12.820 --> 23:13.101
One tier.

23:13.121 --> 23:13.521
Yeah, yeah.

23:13.687 --> 23:16.674
I can't recall that we did the wedding cake type deal.

23:16.894 --> 23:18.859
And no sabotage, no attempts?

23:18.879 --> 23:21.685
Well we used to have to guard it 24 hours.

23:21.745 --> 23:24.692
But what happened is we split the time, our outfit I think.

23:25.334 --> 23:30.706
In the four years that I was there maybe we had one night for, and it was a short period of time.

23:30.726 --> 23:32.590
It could be two hours or three hours and that was it.

23:33.160 --> 23:46.585
It was a time that you sat down and the upperclassmen would sit there, and it was a freshman privilege to tell dirty jokes, so the freshmen had to come to guard the bonfire with the upperclassmen, and they had to be prepared to tell dirty jokes.

23:47.146 --> 23:51.254
So they'd tell you, okay, it's your turn, Fish Garcia, and you'd get up and you'd have to tell a dirty joke.

23:52.035 --> 23:53.498
And that's how we passed the time.

23:54.406 --> 24:00.353
You went to football games regularly and basketball regularly.

24:00.373 --> 24:01.654
I had to go to every football game.

24:01.675 --> 24:02.435
That was a requirement.

24:02.676 --> 24:03.376
You had to go.

24:03.877 --> 24:05.859
There was no excuse for that.

24:06.240 --> 24:08.783
And A&M wasn't winning many games then.

24:08.803 --> 24:11.366
No, we didn't win very many.

24:12.747 --> 24:20.076
Who were the star athletes that you all admired, cheered for most loudly?

24:20.647 --> 24:24.731
It wasn't basketball, Broussard, yeah.

24:25.011 --> 24:29.515
And I can't really remember a lot of the other ones.

24:29.535 --> 24:31.137
Football didn't win much.

24:31.157 --> 24:36.942
No we didn't win much so it really didn't make any difference who it was.

24:37.523 --> 24:39.725
What did you and your buddies think of Yale leaders?

24:39.825 --> 24:41.907
Was that a big deal to be a Yale leader?

24:41.947 --> 24:43.749
Not as big as it is today.

24:43.769 --> 24:46.992
I mean they really have, a Yale leader was

24:48.220 --> 24:57.318
It was just another thing that you did, you know, but it wasn't like, today they have, they give it a lot more presence, and probably because the student body's a lot bigger.

24:59.543 --> 25:01.266
Did you all have a high respect for the band?

25:01.948 --> 25:02.349
The band?

25:03.190 --> 25:03.451
Never.

25:07.379 --> 25:09.503
Did you all have any nicknames for the band?

25:13.769 --> 25:20.383
Who were the most respected student leader, what were the most respected student leader positions?

25:20.864 --> 25:22.067
The corps commander, of course.

25:23.309 --> 25:26.496
You know, that was in staff people, people on staffs.

25:26.898 --> 25:31.105
Was there even a student body president there?

25:31.125 --> 25:31.466
Yes.

25:31.486 --> 25:32.047
Oh, yeah.

25:32.067 --> 25:32.327
Yeah.

25:32.447 --> 25:36.074
Well, those were mostly all Corps people.

25:36.114 --> 25:42.124
They had a council that was formed.

25:42.144 --> 25:52.922
There was a senior council, two of them, that if the student was in a problem situation that he was, you know, he had to go before that council and they would

25:53.476 --> 25:55.820
they would come out with a finding on it.

25:55.860 --> 25:57.583
A person could get kicked out of school or whatever.

25:57.623 --> 26:02.392
They would lead that, but those were the different types of groups that we had.

26:03.894 --> 26:10.506
There was a president, no doubt, and a vice president, but they weren't like

26:12.089 --> 26:18.461
like you really went out and did a lot of politicking to get there.

26:18.841 --> 26:20.484
Pretty much you knew who it was going to be.

26:21.266 --> 26:25.754
Now the head yell leader was always big.

26:26.575 --> 26:27.276
It always has been.

26:27.317 --> 26:32.005
I mean head yell leader automatically was on core staff back then.

26:32.525 --> 26:39.774
And so that was the only thing that I can remember that the head Yale leader was always, was big time, you know.

26:40.575 --> 26:50.386
The other Yale leaders were mostly, and it's weird because back then I think we had reserved a spot for a civilian student.

26:52.048 --> 26:59.477
So you had X number of Yale leaders that were core and then one spot was reserved for a civilian student.

27:00.031 --> 27:07.743
They used to have football games between the military and the civilian, which they used to call the maroon and white game.

27:07.763 --> 27:20.503
And that was an annual event where they'd go out and work out with the football pads and all that, and so many people would try out for it, and then they'd go ahead and have their annual game.

27:21.004 --> 27:23.829
But I think they did away with that by the time I was a senior.

27:25.491 --> 27:27.895
Seeing cadets, did you all have a higher respect for them?

27:28.752 --> 27:36.823
Well, not, we'd always have something, we'd call them something that was not really nice enough.

27:37.504 --> 27:44.534
But they were a good group, you know, and they were recognized pretty well by everybody.

27:44.634 --> 27:47.338
Were you aware that there were any secret fraternities?

27:49.220 --> 27:50.202
No.

27:50.222 --> 27:52.084
No.

27:52.104 --> 27:56.110
I had heard that there were some movements of some secret fraternities that were like

27:56.495 --> 28:02.904
your Nazi type operations, but never in our outfits, none of the outfits that I was around were like that.

28:02.924 --> 28:10.755
I couldn't see that really happening because everybody was, you know, pretty close to each other, you know.

28:11.076 --> 28:13.739
And so, no, no, there wasn't anything like that.

28:14.761 --> 28:21.270
When you and your buddies went out to have a good time at the Clay Pits out by the river,

28:21.841 --> 28:26.851
Where did people, and was it normally beer that was consumed?

28:26.871 --> 28:28.333
Beer, that was all they had.

28:28.454 --> 28:29.636
Did people get drunk?

28:31.660 --> 28:32.120
Not really.

28:32.481 --> 28:37.150
I mean they wouldn't buy like, it's not like I see students today that

28:37.737 --> 28:43.665
They would, you know, they'd buy tons of stuff, you know, and I mean they'd drink until they drop, you know, and no.

28:44.065 --> 28:53.598
No they would only, let's see, we had a keg of beer, maybe two kegs of beer, you have 40, 50, I don't know, actually more than I would say, 60 to 70 cadets in the outfit.

28:53.618 --> 28:54.680
That's not going to go very far.

28:54.840 --> 28:56.282
And it was almost male only?

28:56.602 --> 28:59.025
It's all male, yeah.

28:59.046 --> 29:01.669
And did you all go skinny dipping?

29:01.953 --> 29:02.735
Do you any swimming?

29:02.835 --> 29:07.186
No, we'd pull some pranks off and maybe throw people in the river and that kind of stuff.

29:07.206 --> 29:11.155
But nothing, because it was always in the evening so they were pretty careful.

29:11.175 --> 29:12.418
The upperclassmen, you know,

29:12.803 --> 29:15.567
Mainly the seniors and the juniors would always look out.

29:15.667 --> 29:16.568
They felt responsible.

29:16.588 --> 29:18.411
They were very responsible about those things.

29:18.671 --> 29:20.674
And you caught a ride out there?

29:20.955 --> 29:21.295
Yeah.

29:21.315 --> 29:27.764
We'd have to get a ride and one of the, whoever had cars there would get a ride from the people in our outfit.

29:27.804 --> 29:29.086
Friday nights, Saturday nights?

29:29.206 --> 29:30.068
Normally Friday nights.

29:30.088 --> 29:32.872
It was before football games normally.

29:33.332 --> 29:37.138
Before Yale practice we'd go out there and come back and go to midnight Yale practice.

29:37.518 --> 29:40.262
Now if somebody was wanting to have a big

29:40.242 --> 29:43.853
Saturday night in Bryan College Station, where did they go?

29:45.378 --> 29:46.802
There weren't really any places to go.

29:47.705 --> 29:52.480
Outside of the movie houses and really you couldn't

29:53.303 --> 29:59.971
I remember some of my friends, well, some of my buddies from San Antonio were all Mexican-American.

30:00.011 --> 30:04.697
We decided we were going to go to the VFW.

30:05.057 --> 30:11.265
Figured that was, supposedly we heard that was mostly all Hispanics, and they really didn't accept us very well.

30:12.407 --> 30:14.910
So we left, so we weren't really accepted.

30:14.950 --> 30:16.432
And Lulax, really the same thing.

30:16.492 --> 30:20.897
I mean, it was weird because I guess they thought that because we were going to college that

30:20.877 --> 30:26.944
Of course that's changed over the years, but it was kind of weird.

30:27.265 --> 30:29.287
Did many Aggies go to Whiskey Bridge?

30:30.208 --> 30:33.312
Oh yeah, the one up there going back toward Snook.

30:33.973 --> 30:35.494
Yeah, that was a popular place.

30:35.575 --> 30:39.199
Was there any other place close by to buy whiskey?

30:39.219 --> 30:40.340
Not that I remember.

30:40.360 --> 30:42.683
That's a place that everybody would go to and buy it over there.

30:42.743 --> 30:48.650
Did anybody, did you ever hear any Aggies talk about going to the chicken ranch at LaGrange?

30:48.670 --> 30:49.051
Oh yeah.

30:49.371 --> 30:50.192
Is that right?

30:50.898 --> 31:03.859
Yeah, I remember mainly during fish week when you had fish freshmen, the upperclassmen, like the seniors, would have their, I guess, pilgrimage over there.

31:03.879 --> 31:10.990
And normally what I remember going with them as freshmen, they just told me, you're coming with us, and they took me.

31:11.010 --> 31:14.055
I was driving, because they were having a good time.

31:14.456 --> 31:15.517
So they'd take me over there.

31:15.537 --> 31:17.901
I went to the chicken ranch a couple of times.

31:18.421 --> 31:23.943
And so, yeah, we went over there, and I saw what was going on there.

31:24.043 --> 31:25.931
It was kind of funny.

31:25.951 --> 31:27.959
It's not as elaborate as people talk about it.

31:27.979 --> 31:29.545
It was just an old house.
