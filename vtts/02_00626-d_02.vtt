WEBVTT

00:01.448 --> 00:07.537
then at Scripps, and then went back to Rhode 
Island. But he's been very active in the kind of

00:07.697 --> 00:21.837
political aspects of these things and so on, and 
you certainly ought

00:07.697 --> 00:21.837
to have a talk with him now. research vessels. 
Obviously you don't have any when you come here.

00:28.837 --> 00:29.377
What do you do? How do you go about it? What kind do 
you try to choose? What do you want your

00:31.800 --> 00:33.441
undergraduates to have? Just tell me about it. 
Well, here we were influenced a good deal by also

00:36.003 --> 00:50.476
local tradition and so on. And when I arrived here 
in 51, the department under primarily under Dr.

00:53.508 --> 01:14.385
Barnes's I think impetus had obtained through 
sort of government surplus a small vessel that had

00:53.508 --> 01:14.385
been originally built by the Bureau of Commercial 
Fisheries. She was about 115 feet long, wood hull,

01:18.124 --> 01:41.014
and had been designed not as a fishing vessel, but 
essentially as a small kind of passenger and

01:18.124 --> 01:41.014
freight vessel to take care of supplying 
fisheries

01:18.124 --> 01:41.014
programs up in Alaska and so on. She had an 
interesting sort of characteristic that she

01:41.450 --> 01:59.502
could accommodate, although she was a small 
vessel, she could accommodate quite a large

01:41.450 --> 01:59.502
number of passengers and had a large hold which in 
effect we were able to convert to a sort of

01:41.450 --> 01:59.502
laboratory. She was not, didn't have a great deal 
of deck space and so on. But this vessel had been

02:05.041 --> 02:16.496
procured, and it required a certain amount of 
conversion, as they always do, and also the

02:05.041 --> 02:16.496
installation of necessary winches and so on. We 
used this what was, in a sense, a very small type

02:17.277 --> 02:29.192
vessel up until we obtained the the Thompson, 
which is one of these Agars, in about 1965 or 66. So

02:37.712 --> 02:59.854
we used Brown Bear for about 15 years, and not only 
for local work inside Puget Sound and so on and off

02:37.712 --> 02:59.854
the coast, but we took her out into the North 
Pacific. not but she was range limited as well as so

03:00.509 --> 03:29.622
size limited and so it was sort of gulf of alaska and 
so on but out along the illusion chain and in 1964

03:00.509 --> 03:29.622
and i'm sorry 19

03:00.509 --> 03:29.622
must be 19 1959, 1960, we actually took her north up 
into the Bering Sea and actually into the Arctic.

03:39.694 --> 03:50.091
So we extended, we stretched her capabilities 
just about as much

03:51.033 --> 03:53.937
and maybe beyond sort of reasonable limits. But 
she proved to be a very kind of efficient vessel in

03:54.037 --> 04:03.909
that she could be operated with a fairly small crew 
and so on. And we thought we got a lot of good work out

04:03.929 --> 04:08.614
of her. When she was replaced by the T.G. Thompson, 
we were We were clearly thought of vessel limited,

04:15.653 --> 04:41.172
but we ended up with a real sort of problem here in 
the fact that we were really rather reluctant to

04:15.653 --> 04:41.172
take on one of these AGARs, but had been told 
repeatedly by ONR and NSF that the vessel would be

04:15.653 --> 04:41.172
completely funded. because it was almost an order 
of magnitude jump here in the cost of operations

04:41.557 --> 04:49.445
and so on. So we finally did, and of course we no 
sooner had delivery of the ship than they said they

04:50.186 --> 04:57.494
couldn't budget it. And the department has really 
been fighting ever since to, in a sense, get

04:57.514 --> 05:10.888
adequate vessels, operation support for the 
vessels. And one thing we did not get involved in,

05:12.303 --> 05:39.222
and it was done intentionally, and

05:12.303 --> 05:39.222
maybe hard to tell whether we were right or wrong, 
but we never got involved in anything like the

05:12.303 --> 05:39.222
Indian Ocean Expedition, or even going back prior 
to that to the IGY of using this as a mechanism, in a

05:39.573 --> 05:48.976
sense, to expand the fleet and so on, which was 
clearly done, I think, at some of the

05:39.573 --> 05:48.976
institutions. They used these major national 
efforts to increase the size of their fleet. But

05:58.276 --> 06:13.671
we've never felt we had quite the same, or I never 
felt, maybe I should say, and I know some of the

05:58.276 --> 06:13.671
faculty would agree with me, that we should try and 
do the same kind of things as Scripps and Woods Hole

05:58.276 --> 06:13.671
did. But we had our own destiny to try and work out 
here, which didn't necessarily involve the very

06:14.052 --> 06:24.582
extensive sea-going cruises. Did you expect all 
your undergraduates to work on the vessel out at

06:25.523 --> 06:29.830
sea? Oh,

06:30.951 --> 06:49.860
I think I would have said yes if you go back to the 
early 50s or something, but

06:30.951 --> 06:49.860
we got very much caught up with this. The Sputnik 
era here, with increased interest in science and

06:51.528 --> 06:59.657
so on. And certainly the ocean became a very 
romantic sort of an area of study. And so our

07:10.329 --> 07:20.320
undergraduate program shot up at a rate that I 
don't think we would ever have sort of predicted.

07:21.025 --> 07:31.517
And we were, our undergraduate enrollment in 
oceanography was increasing about 25% a year,

07:21.025 --> 07:31.517
which means it doubled every three years. And we 
went from one student or something in 1952, and we

07:32.318 --> 07:48.197
were up to I think over 800 in

07:50.135 --> 07:53.218
Well, the early 60s, I guess it was. And, I mean, it 
was clearly obvious you couldn't do the kind of

07:55.821 --> 08:12.100
things that we'd originally had in mind, which, as 
I think I mentioned earlier, a really sort of

07:55.821 --> 08:12.100
practical preparation of sea work and so forth. 
And it got to a point that We couldn't even give

08:15.835 --> 08:35.539
laboratories

08:15.835 --> 08:35.539
with our formal courses because we didn't have the 
capacity to handle this number of students, so

08:15.835 --> 08:35.539
even the kind of laboratory work clearly suffered 
under this expansion. It was very exciting, but I

08:39.460 --> 08:43.125
think, probably went too far. Now, I don't know 
what the later, what's happening in the last year

08:43.165 --> 08:51.356
or two, but it's dropped down considerably, the 
undergraduate enrollment. But it, in a sense, got

08:51.436 --> 09:03.392
overinflated here, but not really due to our 
recruiting efforts or anything, but just because

08:51.436 --> 09:03.392
of the general

09:05.768 --> 09:30.831
And we've done a lot of things other than just the 
sort of formal

09:05.768 --> 09:30.831
undergraduate and graduate training here, in 
that

09:05.768 --> 09:30.831
it started back in the days where I really felt we 
did need to provide some input of students and so

09:05.768 --> 09:30.831
on. which involved working with high school 
teachers and so on. I ran summer institutes for

09:34.768 --> 09:48.330
high school teachers for a number of years here, 
with the idea that they'd encourage some of their

09:34.768 --> 09:48.330
students to come into the field. I've been 
involved in the writing of two high school level

09:48.350 --> 09:57.865
textbooks.

09:58.486 --> 10:17.558
So we did that, and one of the things which had 
started before the war was a general sort of

09:58.486 --> 10:17.558
introductory oceanography course which still 
carries them. number of Oceanography 101, which

10:18.803 --> 10:26.931
was in no way intended for our own majors, but a 
science orientation course. And most of the

10:28.232 --> 10:36.860
students who take it are not even science 
students, but humanities and social science

10:28.232 --> 10:36.860
students. We were teaching. That's a five-credit 
course. And a few years ago, at least, we were

10:40.163 --> 10:47.730
teaching that to over 1,500 students a year.

10:48.318 --> 10:50.420
We build up, certainly. I must have some sort of 
general public awareness of the field, at least.

11:02.270 --> 11:05.674
And I think these are worthwhile things. They're 
not just sort of promotional. But anybody living

11:09.837 --> 11:16.283
around here, I think, ought to know a little bit 
about what the ocean is like.

11:18.254 --> 11:22.739
So that's still going on. When you started to 
outfit these early vessels, did you have a

11:22.759 --> 11:26.864
professional captain do something? Something 
like James Spahn, I'm thinking of, or did you try to

11:26.884 --> 11:30.368
do it within your department? No, we started out in 
a sort of small way here, and the first man we had who

11:31.109 --> 11:47.788
was skipper of, he'd been a skipper of an even 
smaller vessel before the Brown Bear, had no sort

11:48.359 --> 11:53.805
of formal training as an officer. He had been a 
fisherman primarily, and a small boat operator

11:54.406 --> 12:05.478
type person, and came in and kind of learned the job 
as he went along. He was a marvelous individual,

12:05.558 --> 12:16.611
and Frank Princehouse, and

12:05.558 --> 12:16.611
very much interested in the in what we were trying 
to do, and extremely cooperative and very good at

12:17.013 --> 12:25.501
taking care of the vessel and the crew and so on. We 
actually had to see that he got the opportunity to

12:26.362 --> 12:38.835
get some sort of special training and so on when the 
Thompson came along, because otherwise he

12:26.362 --> 12:38.835
couldn't have been captain on the Thompson. 
Unfortunately, shortly after we got the

12:38.855 --> 12:46.362
Thompson, he developed a serious Elmont and since 
died, but he was captain on her for about a year or

12:47.354 --> 12:53.741
so. And then we went to these more sort of 
professionally trained officers. And I think the

13:00.549 --> 13:09.379
man that's captain now is the Thompson that came to 
us from Scripps, having been on one of their ships.

13:09.459 --> 13:12.923
So there's been a switch there, but it's partly 
related again just to the size of the vessels and

13:13.342 --> 13:24.499
the kind of Coast Guard regulations about the 
types of officers that you have to have on board.

13:26.082 --> 13:33.833
When you first come to Washington, the funding for 
oceanography and oceanographic departments was

13:26.082 --> 13:33.833
sort of a block funding. That is, that... When I 
came out here. When you came out here, right. Yes.

13:37.678 --> 13:44.567
Is that ONR and so forth would give sort of a block 
funding to a university, which has moved recently

13:37.678 --> 13:44.567
to sort of special project fundings. What sort of 
feeling do you have about that as it affects the way

13:44.928 --> 13:48.793
you try to work your department? Well, of course, 
I've been out of this, you know, for about ten

13:48.813 --> 13:53.119
years. But I just think it's been a very 
unfortunate sort of trend. And I keep hoping I can

14:03.718 --> 14:08.146
see some sign that's going to reverse itself. But I 
don't think I have been able to see anything so far

14:08.226 --> 14:15.698
that, yes, although the In a sense, in terms of the 
total dollars, they were small now compared to

14:16.353 --> 14:27.825
what's being transferred

14:16.353 --> 14:27.825
these days. Nevertheless, they were relatively 
large amounts, and in the first few years when

14:28.446 --> 14:40.318
essentially all our support came from ONR, it 
almost used to be done by letter. they'd send us a

14:40.889 --> 14:44.072
letter saying, what do you want to do? And we'd 
write a letter back saying, we think it'd be fun to

14:44.212 --> 14:47.355
do so. And they'd say, well, we think we can give you 
X thousand dollars next year. And why don't you

14:51.779 --> 14:54.541
write a request for that? And we'd write another 
letter saying, we'd like to have so much for next

14:54.561 --> 14:57.984
year. And that was it. But since then, it has gone 
progressively towards more agencies involved,

15:01.087 --> 15:09.715
which in a way, is life insurance, I think, from our 
point of view, because not all of them go up and down

15:10.825 --> 15:23.339
at the same time, so it gives you some sort of 
security in that way. But the fact that the

15:24.280 --> 15:33.711
projects have been split down and down and down and 
down, and two, the situation which I feel prevails

15:33.978 --> 15:52.857
today where money is not allocated really to, 
although legally it comes to the university and to

15:33.978 --> 15:52.857
the department, it's based on these individual 
sort of proposals. And what people do is start

15:53.438 --> 16:03.428
talking about my money and my ship time and so 
forth.

16:04.201 --> 16:20.338
I think that from an administrative point of view 
it's essentially an intolerable situation and

16:04.201 --> 16:20.338
that the chairman of the department has no way of 
administering. All he's doing is trying to fit

16:21.259 --> 16:32.571
together all these little bits and pieces and he 
has no way of fitting things together in most

16:21.259 --> 16:32.571
cases. and saying, okay, you two fellows get 
together, use the ship jointly or something. They

16:38.970 --> 16:42.514
both say, well, I got my money to do so and so on. And 
it's completely sort of ridiculous. I think it's a

16:46.539 --> 16:54.528
part of sort of Parkinson's law here that this is 
the way in which a bureaucracy functions. It tends

16:54.648 --> 17:00.735
to generate work for itself, and this is exactly 
what I can see is happening in Washington, that If

17:01.238 --> 17:13.994
you can have 100 projects under your guidance, 
rather than 10, you've got that much more paper,

17:01.238 --> 17:13.994
and you justify many more positions, and so on. But 
this, plus the fact that there are many, many more

17:14.835 --> 17:28.613
sort of bookkeeping requirements these days than 
there used to be,

17:14.835 --> 17:28.613
really makes it major sort of problem, I think, 
from the administrative point of view, to do these

17:28.930 --> 17:36.543
things. The problem, I think, has sort of been 
compounded recently by the fact that they've got

17:36.583 --> 17:47.783
into this multi-institutional pattern here and I 
haven't had any direct part of any of these things

17:48.320 --> 18:04.782
because I don't know how they manage to do those 
things and keep them going. But even the Sea Grant

18:04.802 --> 18:12.792
program was originally thought of as a sort of 
block funding type thing and even there they

18:13.463 --> 18:25.861
without any kind of appropriate authorization 
from Congress or anything, they went off in the

18:13.463 --> 18:25.861
same direction of breaking things down into 
ridiculously small things. And there's all the

18:25.881 --> 18:33.612
paperwork involved with this, as well as the lack 
of flexibility. The other thing that's been

18:33.972 --> 18:38.779
happening here is the fact that you're committed 
to making plans longer and longer in advance that

18:39.316 --> 18:48.549
you want any kind of major support these days. 
You've probably got a plan about three years ahead

18:48.590 --> 18:53.256
and hard to get it. The result is, by the time this 
third year's rolled around, you have absolutely

18:54.218 --> 19:00.066
no flexibility. If things have changed or 
something, you're kind of stuck with things. So

19:06.653 --> 19:18.450
that planning is fine, but certainly you lose any 
kind of choice in things.

19:19.431 --> 19:35.715
A lot of the problems that have come from the 
combination of inflation and reduced funding and

19:19.431 --> 19:35.715
so on have really been most critical since I 
stepped aside as chairman of the department. And I

19:36.185 --> 19:49.399
thought I was leaving everything and looked rosy 
at the time that I decided that I would step down as

19:36.185 --> 19:49.399
chairman. And I couldn't, in a sense, I probably 
couldn't have chosen a better time. But I

19:55.285 --> 20:02.513
certainly had no anticipation of what was going to 
happen. What about the division of agencies,

20:03.353 --> 20:06.056
which you mentioned earlier? Let me sketch 
something for you. ONR becomes more

20:10.440 --> 20:17.888
mission-oriented as it advances upward after 
World War II, let's say particularly after 1949.

20:18.428 --> 20:26.396
And you begin to have the rise of NSF and other 
scientific agencies to administer

20:18.428 --> 20:26.396
oceanography. Was this essentially a good thing? 
Well, the...

20:40.040 --> 20:47.849
I think it was for probably many different sort of 
reasons. But ONR was obviously strictly a Navy

20:47.869 --> 21:05.228
type thing, although in the early days they 
certainly interpreted their responsibilities

20:47.869 --> 21:05.228
very broadly, I think, relatively speaking. But 
there were areas that they were sort of not

21:05.268 --> 21:08.832
touching at all. But essentially, at least my 
interpretation is that sort of out of the ONR model

21:09.554 --> 21:18.903
came this idea for NSF. And NSF was set up, as I 
recall, in 1951. Let's see, the first director was

21:23.808 --> 21:33.277
moved over from ONR, remember, wasn't it? 
Waterman.

21:36.875 --> 21:45.606
But the general situation was that ONR would 
continue to support oceanography. NSF would get

21:45.866 --> 21:49.650
into, essentially, other fields. And NSF really 
didn't get into oceanography to any, I think I'm

21:50.752 --> 22:05.970
right in saying, any kind of significant extent 
until the IGYCAPE program came along, which was

21:50.752 --> 22:05.970
actually in what was it, 57, 58, but where the 
funding must have predated that by a year or so. And

22:14.135 --> 22:36.126
I think NSF picked that up because, well, it was not 
just oceanography, there were many other

22:14.135 --> 22:36.126
aspects, but it would not have been appropriate 
for ONR to have gone into all of these other fields

22:14.135 --> 22:36.126
besides oceanography, certainly some of them. So 
this is really what moved NSF into the picture, and

22:36.612 --> 22:43.880
they've essentially never been out of it since. 
And the

22:45.101 --> 23:01.219
sort of drift of things has been such that we've 
been told various times, well, NSF's going to pick

22:45.101 --> 23:01.219
up more and more of this.

23:01.992 --> 23:04.195
I don't know quite what has happened. ONR seemed to 
be sort of going down in level of support as far as

23:04.455 --> 23:15.731
they were concerned here, but now I hear that maybe 
they're coming up again and so on. What has been

23:16.051 --> 23:22.380
difficult is for us, and we're not alone in this, is 
to how do you sort of deal with ONR, NSF, AEC, which

23:22.613 --> 23:42.498
no longer exists under that name, but how do you 
keep some sort of a balance or whatever with these

23:22.613 --> 23:42.498
different agencies? And very often I feel that we 
have been in the position of kind of divide and

23:42.739 --> 23:51.810
conquer. where all the money and so forth existed 
in Washington. They were the ones who got together

23:55.877 --> 24:04.814
and decided, well, we'll support this 
institution to such and such a level. We're put in a

24:05.516 --> 24:09.343
position of asking people for in a sense, 
overlapping kind of support. I don't think this is

24:13.149 --> 24:14.850
actually done. But I mean, you never know quite 
what's going to come out of these things. So I think

24:20.356 --> 24:23.940
it's been kind of a scary game here. And AEC

24:24.060 --> 24:37.153
turned out to be a fairly substantial supporter 
for our work here, and entirely on sort of

24:24.060 --> 24:37.153
environmental studies, although they were 
related to to essentially radioactive materials

24:37.927 --> 24:45.257
that might get into the Columbia River and so on. So 
that was a concern to them, but they were a kind of

24:45.798 --> 24:51.105
major supporter here. It seems almost to an 
outsider that it's as if oceanographers looked at

24:52.106 --> 25:04.984
what the government wanted and planned a research 
topic they might get funded rather than moving out

24:52.106 --> 25:04.984
and directing research to what interested them. 
Is that a? I think so, and of course there's always

25:06.833 --> 25:35.794
the kind of argument here about freedom of 
research and so forth, and I think all of the

25:06.833 --> 25:35.794
agencies have

25:06.833 --> 25:35.794
made quite a conscious effort to play fair on this 
thing, but the fact is that they do influence you a

25:36.196 --> 25:44.486
good deal, not by telling you what to do, but by 
refusing to support things that they didn't want

25:36.196 --> 25:44.486
to do. So things do become very much controlled in 
this way, and exceedingly difficult to get sort of

25:44.586 --> 26:05.511
new things started, and particularly to get sort 
of younger men started and so on here.

26:06.200 --> 26:22.184
So I think it reached a point where there was a sort 
of undesirable

26:06.200 --> 26:22.184
amount of control over what goes on. Sure, you do 
things where the money is. Now, we've chosen in a

26:25.128 --> 26:28.693
few cases not to go where the money was. We didn't 
participate at all in this Indian Ocean

26:29.595 --> 26:36.004
expedition by choice. We did not, we were asked at 
one time if we wanted to get involved in a lot of the

26:36.187 --> 26:47.000
Antarctic operations, and we said no thank you, we 
didn't want to.

26:47.761 --> 27:03.240
We've, I guess, here have operated a little bit 
more on a sort of an individual basis than some, and

26:47.761 --> 27:03.240
have not participated maybe as much in some of 
these multi-institutional programs that have

27:03.676 --> 27:08.564
been coming along here in recent years. Some of the 
individuals have. They've participated and gone

27:10.908 --> 27:13.934
on and so on. Now, we did get quite involved here for 
several years in this as part of the

27:13.954 --> 27:28.198
international,

27:13.954 --> 27:28.198
what's it called, international biological 
program on this upwelling.

27:31.520 --> 27:39.229
But we've more or less operated

27:31.520 --> 27:39.229
more by ourselves, in a way. Is this because of the 
undergraduate emphasis here? No, I don't think

27:44.015 --> 27:56.970
one could say that, although the

27:44.015 --> 27:56.970
good many of the faculty are involved in teaching, 
either at undergraduate or graduate level, which

27:57.558 --> 28:12.018
means that they're not entirely free to go off for 
long periods without making appropriate sort of

27:57.558 --> 28:12.018
adjustments and reallocations.

28:14.362 --> 28:20.170
No, I think it's more sort of individual choices. I 
may be overemphasizing this in a way,

28:27.089 --> 28:56.218
One

28:27.089 --> 28:56.218
thing that I sort of fought against for a number of 
years was getting involved in

28:27.089 --> 28:56.218
this

28:27.089 --> 28:56.218
general sort of marine geophysics, this 
refraction and reflection, seismic shooting and

28:27.089 --> 28:56.218
so on, which involved carrying explosives and 
was, in a sense, kind of a hazardous thing. And I

29:03.112 --> 29:05.775
said, I didn't think we ought to get into that. 
There were two or three institutions that were

29:05.835 --> 29:09.119
heavily involved in it. Why did we have to get into 
it? Well, lo and behold, some money came along, and

29:11.621 --> 29:17.228
we were doing it. And we no sooner got started on it 
than ONR cut off the support. So we were probably

29:22.514 --> 29:26.458
being well advised never to get really sort of 
committed to that thing. And I think there have

29:30.630 --> 29:36.335
been some, probably some similar sort of things. 
So

29:36.415 --> 29:56.833
it's,

29:36.415 --> 29:56.833
I think if one took a really sort of objective view 
of things, one would find that The programs in this

29:57.674 --> 30:06.284
country are pretty much sort of what the federal 
government agencies want them to be. There's very

30:07.365 --> 30:10.749
little sort of independence here now. They can 
always turn around and say that anybody who wants

30:11.190 --> 30:19.339
to can submit a proposal on anything they think 
they want to do. If something isn't going on, it's

30:19.459 --> 30:23.544
because nobody's interested in doing the work. So 
they're kind of stuck on this. I, just for fun here

30:27.948 --> 30:39.288
several years ago, I dreamed up a rhetorical 
question. I asked Professor Rattray whether I

30:39.308 --> 30:43.876
could have the Thompson for a couple of weeks. And 
he said, what do you want the Thompson for? And I

30:45.619 --> 30:50.768
said, I'm not going to tell you, but I've got an idea 
that I want to test. Can I have the ship for a couple

30:50.788 --> 30:52.791
of weeks? And he thought for a while, and he said, 
well, he guessed I could. It would require some

30:59.142 --> 31:04.548
telephoning to Washington to get some funds 
reallocated and so on. But if I really had a good

31:04.568 --> 31:07.672
thing, I could probably get the ship. And I said, 
what about some people to help me? And he said, oh,

31:10.215 --> 31:11.977
no, no people. Everybody's committed, you see, to 
other programs. So I had, this was just,

31:22.032 --> 31:29.482
hypothetical question, but it indicates how tied 
up you are with the system in a way. We had a, we've

31:29.502 --> 31:41.678
mentioned it at lunchtime here, we had this 
drought situation this year, and it was more than

31:29.502 --> 31:41.678
just a local drought, something very unusual has 
been happening out in the
