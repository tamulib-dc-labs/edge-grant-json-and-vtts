WEBVTT

00:01.887 --> 00:29.667
classes getting up going to class drill and so 
forth when did well it started about 6 30 in the

00:01.887 --> 00:29.667
morning when you're waking up by the whistle jock 
blow in the whistle and get up and get dressed and go

00:01.887 --> 00:29.667
out march to chow and we did that we marched chow 
morning noon at night when i was here and uh go chow

00:01.887 --> 00:29.667
are you gonna come back Take care of your room 
because you're always subject to being

00:30.490 --> 00:36.680
inspected, which was a good habit to get into. All 
those things are habits that you get into in life.

00:42.009 --> 00:46.677
And if you're messy and sloppy with your room, you 
tend to be that way. You took care of that and you

00:48.840 --> 00:51.064
went on to class. Class, everybody walked to 
class.

00:58.570 --> 01:03.276
It was always, sometimes it was difficult to get 
from one spot to the other on this campus because it

00:58.570 --> 01:03.276
is a large campus. I recall having a PE class at G. 
Riley White and then the next hour having a

01:03.917 --> 01:14.792
chemistry class and the chemistry class was 
almost on the other side of the campus. And it was

01:14.812 --> 01:20.159
always difficult to get from there to the other 
point. But it was a pleasant deal. You knew so many

01:23.443 --> 01:27.649
of the students. spoke to your students, fellow 
students. At one time, we started having a lot of

01:31.746 --> 01:41.037
civilian students who were transfers in or who did 
not get into the Corps or whatever. But you still

01:41.057 --> 01:44.541
got to know them. And by you, not as well as you did 
with the kids in the Corps, but you still certainly

01:44.781 --> 01:55.273
became more acquainted than I think they're 
existing now because primary science. And we had

01:56.317 --> 01:58.219
some great professors.

02:01.263 --> 02:04.147
I say to folks, they don't have professors. They 
had nicknames. Professors had nicknames.

02:07.030 --> 02:09.153
Please, please, we want those nicknames. Oh, we 
had. And if you know why they were nicknamed what

02:09.934 --> 02:12.257
they were. Oh, yes. Well, we had Ivy League Taylor, 
because he graduated from the Ivy League. He was

02:17.483 --> 02:18.805
always tagging the Ivy Leagues. And he always 
dressed like, he always had the tweed jacket with

02:18.825 --> 02:25.733
the elbow patches and the pipe and the whole bit, 
you know, the. He looked the part, he acted the

02:26.219 --> 02:29.283
part, but he was a good professor. We had Blue Book 
Benton, because you used to take these poli-sci

02:29.744 --> 02:35.912
and history exams in the Blue Books. Well, you 
better take more than one if you take his exams. We

02:39.977 --> 02:46.245
had a guy named C.S. Hampton. That was the initials 
for you. He was a soil science professor, and I will

02:49.709 --> 02:54.876
forget the first time I had one of his quizzes. 
comes in and delivers the quizzes to the class and

02:55.767 --> 03:23.918
it's in a little box and pulls the papers out of the 
box and on top of the box are all these feathers and

02:55.767 --> 03:23.918
he goes and blows the feathers off and says just 
want you all to know that I do earn my nickname and

02:55.767 --> 03:23.918
passed out the quiz and I'll tell you he earned his 
nickname it was a chicken quiz it was tough it was a

02:55.767 --> 03:23.918
tough course we had uh Screamin' Al Nelson. He 
would get excited about the deal. He just didn't

03:28.776 --> 03:30.860
scream it up, his voice. His antics were always on 
campus. Everybody talked about it. Others, you

03:37.571 --> 03:40.315
know, they were characters. Math? Math? I 
don't... I had a farm. So you didn't have... square

03:50.307 --> 03:51.668
root or cube root? No, I didn't have a square root or 
cube root. Chemistry? Biology? Chemistry? Oh, I

03:56.533 --> 03:58.976
had Dr. Sweet. We called him Dr. Tweet. Dr. Tweet 
had a very significant hearing deficiency. So as a

04:07.664 --> 04:13.070
result of the effect of his speech, and his name was 
Sweet, but he pronounced it Tweet. And in a large

04:14.771 --> 04:19.656
lecture class, like biology was, I remember one 
day during class, he was talking about RNA and DNA

04:19.957 --> 04:32.615
and all sorts of stuff that was rolling around my 
mind and I wasn't quite grasping. Raised my hand,

04:32.675 --> 04:43.651
he asked me if there was any question, raised my 
hand and I said, Dr. Sweet, would you, and I went

04:32.675 --> 04:43.651
into my question and he says, when I got through 
with it, he looked at me and he says, yes, that's

04:32.675 --> 04:43.651
right, and went right on with the lecture. I said, 
why bother, you know. We had, uh, Dr. Smith, the

04:47.699 --> 04:57.909
geology department, that if you went to sleep in 
his class, you'd get ready because a racer or a

04:47.699 --> 04:57.909
piece of chalk was coming your way. And he had a 
pretty good arm, too. There were just a lot of

05:01.292 --> 05:08.579
professors that, I was calling Pat Freddie Smith, 
so there was Fred Smith, Pat Freddie. But they

05:09.260 --> 05:15.546
really had a lot of characters, but they were 
professors. that I felt really didn't care about

05:17.078 --> 05:21.203
the students. And I never found a professor yet 
that if I was having some difficulty with the

05:23.065 --> 05:31.796
subject that I went to, they wouldn't do 
everything they could to be helpful. What about

05:32.416 --> 05:36.822
advisors, staff members that you remember? Oh,

05:37.042 --> 05:44.030
some of the folks that were around then are still 
around. I remember that I was I was head yell leader

05:47.234 --> 05:52.219
my senior year, and Malin Southern was the faculty 
advisor for that. What was his nickname? The

05:54.581 --> 05:55.061
Slink. Used to call him the Slink because he'd go 
slinking around the dorms trying to catch boats,

05:57.203 --> 06:03.509
you know, doing improper things. The Wedge?

06:06.892 --> 06:07.993
I don't remember that. Maybe that was different, 
because the simplest of two would own the mail.

06:11.436 --> 06:12.257
That was what happened. It was the Wedge. All 
right. Were there other key corps staff people?

06:19.969 --> 06:20.830
Oh, yes. Of course, you had the folks in the trigon, 
but I changed out from town to town.

06:28.021 --> 06:32.928
I remember one guy in particular who was Captain 
Salamosi. They called him the White Russian. And

06:35.051 --> 06:40.038
he was just a very intense sort of a fellow, a little 
bit in general, Salamosi. And a great guy. But I

06:42.482 --> 06:45.186
believe he was the son Russian immigrants, as a 
matter of fact, is why I call him quite Russian.

06:48.384 --> 06:53.852
Great guy, really sharp guy, but he was an intense 
officer. You started a while ago. Describe Mr.

06:56.235 --> 07:01.462
Rutter and your impression and your evaluation of 
him. General Rutter, when you were an

07:02.584 --> 07:14.160
underclassman and your only involvement was 
maybe another graduation or commissioning

07:02.584 --> 07:14.160
ceremony and having President Rutter give his 
speech, he was not a great speech giver. He could

07:14.714 --> 07:19.299
put you to sleep pretty quickly in the way he gave a 
speech. And so you kind of had an impression

07:19.319 --> 07:29.872
sometimes of an old, doddery old guy, you know, 
sort of a deal. But when you got to be a student

07:30.553 --> 07:36.720
leader, when you came into contact with the 
president, your opinion changed very quickly. My

07:39.042 --> 07:41.245
impression was the first time I met with him, I was 
on staff my junior year, and I was a class officer,

07:42.743 --> 07:48.872
things of this nature. It may have been, I was an RV, 
too. I don't know what it was, but anyway, he had me.

07:54.059 --> 08:00.709
And we started talking about the university and 
its role and our function as leaders and things of

07:54.059 --> 08:00.709
this nature. It wasn't one of these written 
speeches. This was off-the-cuff General Ruddard

08:03.132 --> 08:07.738
talking to the troops. And he got a different 
impression. And later on, I was head-yellied at my

08:09.801 --> 08:12.345
senior year. And I was listening to some other 
things. And so you ended up with a lot more personal

08:16.767 --> 08:19.951
meetings then. And you've got to have the point. If 
you were to open your mouth and say something at the

08:20.973 --> 08:27.602
meeting with the general, you better know what 
you're talking about and be able to back it up,

08:20.973 --> 08:27.602
because he did. And he'd

08:28.904 --> 08:40.300
jam your little thing right up your, down your 
throat if you didn't have your stuff together. And

08:40.320 --> 08:43.665
I did have, with my respect, just went up many, many 
fold of General Rutter. There is one story of

08:47.652 --> 08:56.582
General Rutter, though, that not many people get 
chewed up and spit out like I did one day by General

08:47.652 --> 08:56.582
Rutter. My senior year, as I said, I was head 
Yeliger, and we had a young man who was selected as a

08:58.644 --> 09:08.436
junior Yeliger who was a civilian student. He's 
now a candidate for governor, Gary Marlowe. And

09:11.599 --> 09:13.281
General Rutter called me into his office that 
spring before school was let out. And he said,

09:20.121 --> 09:21.522
Bill, you're going to be a Yale leader. You've got 
this young man, a civilian student. And that's the

09:24.465 --> 09:29.210
most visible position there is on this campus. And 
he said, I expect you to make sure that nothing

09:29.230 --> 09:40.382
happens that would bring disgrace upon this 
university, upon Yale leaders, you, me. Anybody

09:41.122 --> 09:43.624
in any shape or fashion, you understand that? I 
said, yes sir, I sure do, General. You got your

09:45.326 --> 09:47.088
words from the General. You knew what they were, 
you know. Well, Gary wore a belt to the first Yale

09:49.470 --> 10:02.342
practice that had the junior and senior from the 
Corps on it. I didn't know what he had. I didn't

10:03.503 --> 10:05.105
care, you know. But some of the junior members took 
offense at that next Yale practice. They had the

10:10.012 --> 10:14.256
freshman jump in and they took his belt off of him 
and the whole bit. Anyway, I held the junior class

10:15.057 --> 10:24.546
afterwards and I chewed the rearing out and I was in 
front of the family who did all this stuff. I

10:24.566 --> 10:33.175
remember it's 0600 the next morning, I get a call 
from Joe Buser, who was the general's aide. And Joe

10:34.476 --> 10:38.500
says the general will see that 0700 is off, which 
was over in the systems building. I said, yes, sir.

10:40.957 --> 10:41.979
So I was over there. And he was in his office, and I 
was outside waiting. And the secretary just got

10:49.568 --> 10:52.872
there, and says, the general's over here. He wants 
to see you. And I walked in, and I stood at attention

10:54.434 --> 10:56.817
the whole time. It was like I was a freshman on the 
walls of the court. He walked one out on me, chewing

11:00.401 --> 11:02.884
at me. You know, I did this, and you told me to do 
this. And I'm, yes, sir, no, sir, no excuse. I mean,

11:07.510 --> 11:08.571
boy, it was. He ate on me for a little while there, 
and he said, Dismissed. I said, Yes, sir. I turned

11:14.540 --> 11:16.542
around, and I got out of there. On the way out, the 
secretary said, Colonel McCoy wants to see you. He

11:20.086 --> 11:21.407
was calling me. So I go over to Colonel McCoy, and as 
I'm going in the door, Captain Salamosi said, I

11:21.427 --> 11:28.834
want to see you when he gets through. So I go in, and 
he chews on me for a while, but he wasn't near as good

11:28.854 --> 11:35.260
a general as two of them. And then Captain Salamosi 
says, If I spin it, from about 7 o'clock to 11

11:37.812 --> 11:42.978
o'clock that day getting chewed on by everybody by 
a chain of command. What had you done wrong? Oh,

11:45.542 --> 11:46.603
nothing. I had failed to maintain control of the 
situation, and I was told in no uncertain terms

11:46.783 --> 11:59.659
that I was supposed to anticipate things like 
this, and I guess I should have. I didn't think to

11:59.679 --> 12:07.549
inspect his uniform and see those things, but 
anyway, he got to keep his belt, and it never

11:59.679 --> 12:07.549
happened again, I'll assure you that. And nothing 
came of the incident. But my appreciation for the

12:12.331 --> 12:16.215
general just went up immediately. From that point 
on, I was involved in other meetings with world

12:16.255 --> 12:22.101
leaders. General Wilson Moore came to campus one 
time. And I remember how the respect that he was

12:25.204 --> 12:30.190
held by people like that. And my pride in my 
university, my pride in him as the president of the

12:31.851 --> 12:36.456
university just just kept increasing. And I sat 
down with Miss Rudder one time and told her how much

12:38.155 --> 12:47.145
you double, your appreciation grows as time goes 
on. And told her how much I appreciate Virginia.

12:49.168 --> 12:51.851
And she said, well, you're just not the first one 
who's told me that. And I said, yes, ma'am, I didn't

12:51.871 --> 12:55.315
think so. Describe some of the jokes, pranks, good 
bull that you may have known about, whether you

12:56.076 --> 13:02.523
participate in or not. What were some of the good? 
Oh. There were a lot of things that happened that

13:06.845 --> 13:17.657
some people might consider strange or 
outrageous, but we considered kind of funny. It

13:17.678 --> 13:20.821
was, I do recall one incident. I had these friends I 
graduated with, those 13 guys, really were all

13:22.223 --> 13:34.557
innovative with the first bunch of characters, 
but great guys. I do recall the first week when you

13:35.988 --> 13:41.915
were a senior, you were back on campus. Well, you 
waited to wear those boots for a long time, and so

13:41.955 --> 13:47.823
you wear those boots wherever you go, you know, 
class and everything else. And boots, by the way,

13:48.383 --> 13:56.073
are a pain to maintain, because you're always 
rubbing against something, and the polishing and

13:48.383 --> 13:56.073
stuff is a problem. But I know one day, one of our 
classmates was coming back from class, His name is

14:02.887 --> 14:03.768
Steve Beachy. He's the director of Parks and 
Recreation at the City College Station. He's the

14:07.232 --> 14:10.456
one that's put their program on the map out there. 
He's done a great job. But Beachy was coming back

14:11.978 --> 14:22.049
from class and one of my buddies had the fish jump 
Beachy. They take his clothes off of him and they

14:23.231 --> 14:31.240
put him in a mattress cover and they drag him to a mud 
hole and they hang him from one of those trees in the

14:23.231 --> 14:31.240
mattress cover. It's in the quad there, and they 
let him cure for about three or four hours until

14:31.777 --> 14:35.921
about 10 o'clock that night. And he was a little 
irritated at that. But Beachy's one of those type

14:40.806 --> 14:45.810
of guys that you just didn't mess with because he 
would get even. And Judd McNeil was the guy that did

14:46.131 --> 14:47.912
it. We called him Big Judd. Judd was about six foot 
two. He weighed about 270 pounds. He wasn't fat. He

14:54.699 --> 14:55.479
was just big. I mean, his fingers were like twice 
the size of my fingers. He was just a big man, like a

14:58.002 --> 15:01.345
big oak tree. And every day that Beechy would see 
him, he would tell him, maybe not today, maybe

15:02.354 --> 15:09.824
tomorrow. That it's going to happen. He had him 
jump here because he knew something would happen.

15:15.672 --> 15:18.976
So one day, McNeil's coming back from class, and 
his signature was not lit. So Beechy had his

15:19.016 --> 15:23.402
freshman jump in, took every half a fish out of it, 
and held it down. They stripped him, and they drove

15:23.422 --> 15:31.452
four iron stakes in the ground, and they stretched 
him out, and tied his hands and feet to these

15:23.422 --> 15:31.452
stakes. And so he's just naked there in front of God 
and everybody. This is for women, really, we're on

15:34.620 --> 15:37.042
campus too much. And so Beech says, okay, and he had 
the freshman get stuff. So they have a freshman

15:40.326 --> 15:46.753
comes out and he has this jar of honey, he pours it 
all over him, you know, spreads it around a little

15:40.326 --> 15:46.753
bit. And the other one had a sack and it was cracked 
corn. So he throws this cracked corn all over him

15:50.438 --> 15:55.263
and stick him to that honey on his body and 
everything else. And then Beech says, go get him.

15:57.646 --> 16:01.470
So the freshman go in to Beech's room and he brings 
out three chickens. that he had bought at the

16:01.990 --> 16:08.536
hatchery down here on Finnfeather, that he had 
starved in his closet for three days. And they

16:08.897 --> 16:14.002
turned those chickens loose, and they were 
pecking at corn, and McNeil was just bouncing and

16:08.897 --> 16:14.002
jumping up and down. Oh, let me go. Get them off of 
me. It was hilarious. Of course, every time they'd

16:18.766 --> 16:20.888
peck you, they'd leave a red mark. When we got 
through the beach, he suddenly says, McNeil,

16:21.149 --> 16:28.416
don't ever mess with me again. I said, don't worry. 
I won't. There were other things that happened

16:30.205 --> 16:35.431
that were just, that were funny, that were 
hilarious. But it was, I know another one that,

16:36.172 --> 16:44.362
another one of my friends, he ended up being CO of 
the outfit. He was one of the parachute club. He was

16:47.686 --> 16:50.749
the one whose father was the commander of the 
special forces. And so he was going to go airborne

16:51.670 --> 16:57.357
and stuff and he was a sport jumper. And he always 
kept his, He was repacking his chute out there. He

17:01.543 --> 17:04.828
just took it and just threw it in the bottom of his 
closet, and it was all loose and everything. And he

17:05.368 --> 17:11.977
was also, he was a wildlife science major, so at one 
point in time, he had to collect all these snakes.

17:12.658 --> 17:14.760
And he had them in his big mayonnaise jar in his 
room. It was three snakes, and there was two of them

17:15.121 --> 17:17.384
were poisonous. One of them was not. I don't recall 
what the word was. But Dick Judd, again, told him,

17:19.006 --> 17:22.511
he said, I don't like snakes. I don't want you to 
have these snakes in the dorm. I want you to get rid

17:24.113 --> 17:24.934
of them. He said, oh, Dick Judd, I got them in this 
jar. They don't even bother you, et cetera. He

17:27.137 --> 17:27.697
said, I don't want them. Get them out. He said, I'll 
keep it. So McKean goes out on a date with a lady who

17:30.866 --> 17:38.735
had been his wife. And they're on the first floor, I 
think, of Norma's house at one time. And so McKean

17:43.361 --> 17:47.306
goes in with an empty mayonnaise jar and just holds 
it and just drops it. And it crashes on the floor.

17:50.831 --> 17:55.116
Picks up the jar of snakes and takes them and leaves 
with them. And so we have a freshman waiting out in

17:55.136 --> 17:58.380
the senior parking lot for him. when he gets back. 
It's about 1.32 in the morning. He says, he's

18:03.226 --> 18:03.827
coming in. He's coming in the dorm. So we all go out 
and sit out in chairs outside of his dorm. And he

18:09.035 --> 18:13.802
couldn't see us, but you see in the dorm, in the 
window of the dorm. And so he flips the light on.

18:15.905 --> 18:16.406
He's tired. He's sleeping. He starts getting his 
clothes off. He's down to his underwear. He hasn't

18:20.212 --> 18:23.557
seen the broken jar yet. And about the time he 
finally sees the jar, He's just fixing into bed and

18:27.875 --> 18:29.517
sees a jar. Boy, he jumps up on the bed. And his boots 
hung in boot covers on the wall. So he took his

18:35.163 --> 18:37.566
senior boots and he put them on, you know. And he's 
walking around. We got him a little stick or a ruler

18:39.428 --> 18:41.150
or something. He's trying to see if he can find 
those snakes. He can't find them. So he goes in the

18:44.334 --> 18:46.136
closet and there's his chute. You know, he's 
parachuted. So he pulls one of them. He shut eggs,

18:49.120 --> 18:52.023
parachuted, pulls and shakes. Can't find any 
snakes anywhere. So he goes and wakes up the

18:53.505 --> 18:56.228
freshman next door to, wake up everybody in the 
dorm and tell me, boy, the snake's loose. By the

18:59.889 --> 19:04.635
time Neil walks in and says, I got you, snakes, but 
next time I am turning loose in your bed. The snakes

19:05.717 --> 19:06.798
left the dorm. But that's just some of the things. 
There are other things. Yeah, that is good bull.

19:14.970 --> 19:20.838
What was the difference for you in being a 
sophomore and being a freshman? There is a marked

19:20.858 --> 19:21.979
difference. When you're a freshman, what you find 
out really is that once you've learned The people

19:27.038 --> 19:32.805
out there were there to really try to improve you 
and to mold you as a group together. And you start

19:33.285 --> 19:35.808
doing that, and you don't know how the game is 
played. Then you realize they're just playing

19:36.129 --> 19:38.611
with you. And you end up kind of liking it, and you 
realize they like you, and you're liking them, on

19:39.572 --> 19:47.121
top of the other side. But a sophomore kind of 
stands at the side and doesn't participate in

19:47.862 --> 19:51.206
anything. Nobody likes a sophomore, including 
sophomores. And that was a big difference that

19:53.829 --> 19:55.611
year. And what I did observe as my freshman year, 
and those sophomores that, as a freshman,

19:56.907 --> 20:03.236
couldn't kind of have been more than that. And I 
said, which persons do I respect that are

20:04.258 --> 20:10.748
sophomores, and which ones do I think do a good job? 
And I really, that was one of the benefits that you

20:10.928 --> 20:24.068
get to see is who could deal with you in an effective 
way and in a way you respect when they're dealing

20:10.928 --> 20:24.068
with you like sophomores have to do, and those that 
don't. And I adapted that, hopefully. I think he

20:26.152 --> 20:28.595
knows that I respect and admire him. And it gave 
you, it really helped me. And then I did my job my

20:31.798 --> 20:36.683
sophomore year, and I made grades. The 
sophomore's job basically was to do his job and

20:36.703 --> 20:40.767
kind of stay out of the way. And that's what I did, 
and I ended up making grades that semester. And

20:44.151 --> 20:56.023
that's, you position yourself your freshman year 
to really understand what it's all about, and to

20:44.151 --> 20:56.023
make certain decisions in your life, 
realizations about yourself that you can make it.

20:56.392 --> 20:58.354
You can make it academic, but it depends. Your 
sophomore year is to position yourself for your

20:58.374 --> 21:02.297
career at the college. I don't care where it is. 
Your sophomore year really is the year that sets

21:03.979 --> 21:09.584
you up for what you're going to do junior and senior 
year. What was your normal practice in terms of

21:09.604 --> 21:18.031
class attendance, class participation, 
preparation, and so forth? Well, my normal deal

21:18.051 --> 21:25.538
was, and I will tell you that one of the other 
benefits I got was I did not really have study

21:18.051 --> 21:25.538
skills and habits. I had made good grades my entire 
life. I had scored well on the test. I had a

21:32.075 --> 21:33.297
scholarship. I graduated with honors from high 
school. I was always a, quote, good student and one

21:36.801 --> 21:42.187
of the, quote, smart kids and things of this 
nature. I got in here and realized there are a bunch

21:42.207 --> 21:49.095
of times smart folks are a lot smarter than I was, 
and it was not easy to do. As a matter of fact, I

21:50.076 --> 21:55.643
recall the first test I ever took was this math 
course. I made a 45-hour exam. And the thoughts

21:59.059 --> 22:02.203
that went through my mind were, I'm going to flunk 
this course. I'm going to flunk out of school. I'm

22:04.165 --> 22:05.527
going to lose my scholarship. I'm going to 
embarrass my family and friends. I'm going to get

22:08.170 --> 22:09.331
drafted with the Army. I'm going to get sent to 
Vietnam and get killed. I mean, that was my thought

22:10.953 --> 22:12.355
process. And after that, I wrote, I've got to 
buckle down, and I've got to study. And I did. And I

22:18.723 --> 22:24.550
made not good grades that first semester, but 
better than most of my classmates. in the outfit.

22:27.390 --> 22:35.000
And then by my sophomore year, my second semester, 
I learned a little more about what you had to do and

22:27.390 --> 22:35.000
had to do. And my sophomore year, I really, I bucked 
that and I made grades. I de-essed and things of

22:38.886 --> 22:42.110
that nature. Really, really made grades, set 
myself up to get on down the line, so to speak. And

22:46.557 --> 22:51.063
that was also the time I kind of made some career 
decisions about what I wanted to do. I go to law

22:51.083 --> 22:53.727
school and things of that nature. So that was a big 
difference for me. But it was one of those years

22:56.438 --> 23:03.248
that was a successful year, but it was not a fun 
year. I didn't enjoy my sophomore year much as I did

23:04.991 --> 23:11.240
my freshman year, believe it or not, and my later 
years. And I think it's kind of typical. Describe

23:12.962 --> 23:19.091
the role of the MSC and its activities for students 
in your undergraduate years. The MSC was one of

23:19.913 --> 23:22.296
those places that was kind It was like home base. It 
was a safe spot. You could go and sit out over there

23:27.295 --> 23:33.101
with your friends and have coffee and donut and 
relax. And it was there for everybody. It was the

23:36.165 --> 23:41.691
family room of the campus, so to speak. And the 
social life and all those kind of things at the

23:41.711 --> 23:47.398
campus kind of radiated from all that. And it was 
very much an important aspect of the student life

23:48.039 --> 23:51.383
here. I got involved in it. My junior and senior 
year, I was town hall staff. Well, I got into it and

24:00.455 --> 24:04.399
enjoyed that tremendously. My roommate, my 
junior year, was president of MSC, our senior

24:04.420 --> 24:14.631
year, who was in the Sims yesterday.

24:16.553 --> 24:22.860
And got to be with him, because he was a lot more 
involved in MSC than I was, obviously, but worked

24:16.553 --> 24:22.860
with him. stuff there. It was very much an integral 
part of a student's life and it still is. And it is

24:29.640 --> 24:37.132
that way that a lot of folks really get to get 
involved in something on their campus. Through

24:37.412 --> 24:41.819
the MSC did you ever come in contact with some 
famous visitors? Oh sure. Let's see, I do remember

24:43.902 --> 24:50.653
General Westmoreland came while I was here. Oh, 
gosh, I can't remember. There was a former British

24:53.373 --> 25:03.806
prime minister,

24:53.373 --> 25:03.806
General McNamara, whose defense secretary came.

25:08.472 --> 25:09.574
There were... Were you part of SCONA? No, I was not. 
I wasn't part of SCONA. Describe Wayne Stark. The

25:18.405 --> 25:20.708
gentleman.

25:21.987 --> 25:26.031
a tall, stately

25:21.987 --> 25:26.031
gentleman. And ever since the war, he was a person 
of great character. But I had a refinement to him

25:33.097 --> 25:38.022
that you didn't see in a lot of other folks. And I 
think Jay Winstar probably was responsible for

25:39.303 --> 25:47.771
opening so many doors for so many former students. 
That's really unbelievable. Like I said, I didn't

25:49.747 --> 26:02.662
have any problem with him at the moment, but I was 
always just very much impressed with and very,

25:49.747 --> 26:02.662
very much in confidence in all of Mr. Stark. He 
would stir the pot a little bit, but he let the kids

26:03.664 --> 26:19.062
primarily do, he might kind of direct them, kind of 
push them a little bit, but whatever happened,

26:03.664 --> 26:19.062
they did. He changed a lot of lines. What role did 
Guy and Hall play in that time? Well, it was the

26:26.626 --> 26:39.725
first moment I had with us where our freshman was 
taking over to see the movie Never Been Licked,

26:26.626 --> 26:39.725
which I thought was a pretty bad movie then. It 
still is, but it was the only one about A&M. But I saw

26:42.329 --> 26:46.635
that, and of course, that was where all the other A 
lot of other performances took place, theater

26:48.775 --> 27:00.947
performances and entertainment things, until 
finally got to the point where they started having

26:48.775 --> 27:00.947
these concerts that you had to go to right away. It 
was the three of them. It was a classy building,

27:02.829 --> 27:04.791
too, I thought. I enjoyed it. Do you remember any 
religious activities on campus? No, not really. I

27:11.678 --> 27:15.942
don't remember much religious activities on 
campus. I do know that we were always encouraged Of

27:18.965 --> 27:27.757
course, I came from a very strict religious 
upbringing, East Texas Baptist family. And most

27:29.599 --> 27:32.984
of the kids had the same kind of background. And we 
were encouraged by the upper class, and I think the

27:33.004 --> 27:46.322
administration, too, to get involved with 
religious activities in the community. And I

27:47.112 --> 27:51.677
didn't have a car, so I always walked to Northgate 
to church over there. I ended up going quite a bit to

27:52.017 --> 28:13.580
St. Mary's Catholic Church because three of my 
good friends were Catholic boys, and they were a

27:52.017 --> 28:13.580
lot more punctual about their going to religious 
services than some of the Protestant boys were, so

27:52.017 --> 28:13.580
I went with them quite a bit to church. But we did do 
it on a regular basis. Were there any Jewish? Do you

28:18.154 --> 28:19.255
remember any Jewish students? Not very many. I do 
remember some. They were not a large number at all.

28:26.383 --> 28:27.104
How were they treated? Just like everybody else. 
You know, the thing is, I tell folks, when I came

28:30.047 --> 28:37.535
down here, this thing about the content of your 
character and your ability, that was true. The

28:38.055 --> 28:42.500
first person to ever graduate from A&M in the Corps 
of Cadets was a black boy. He was one of my

28:42.520 --> 28:44.442
classmates. My Corps commander was Hector 
Gutierrez, a little Mexican boy from Laredo.

28:50.477 --> 28:54.961
Everybody was accepted for their character and 
their ability. All those little things were kind

28:56.082 --> 28:57.583
of taken away. And that was one of those marvelous 
things I thought about, that experience. This

29:02.307 --> 29:05.750
black corps graduate, how was he treated? Like all 
the rest of the freshman, not very well. But none of

29:10.775 --> 29:11.896
us were treated well. And did anybody single him 
out? Uh, you know, uh, maybe so. I didn't, I wasn't

29:19.152 --> 29:24.898
in the same outfit, but I didn't notice it, uh, if it 
was. And his name is Bill Mayholmes. He's a lawyer

29:27.561 --> 29:29.042
up in Dallas. Bill was from East Texas like I was. He 
was from Lindale, Texas. He'd never gone to school

29:33.187 --> 29:35.009
with a white person. I'd never gone to school with a 
black person because those were days of

29:35.029 --> 29:38.953
segregation in this state. And we came and we both, 
uh, succeeded at A&M. based on our ability, and

29:43.499 --> 29:45.461
that was it.

29:48.565 --> 30:01.218
Bill, as a matter of fact, I do recall one of the 
reunions, Bill came to the reunion with his wife,

29:48.565 --> 30:01.218
who was a wife he met later after college and stuff. 
And I was sitting there just kind of visiting with

30:01.238 --> 30:10.428
her, and of course, everybody coming up, you know, 
and I said, Bill, how you doing? She says, you know,

30:10.448 --> 30:11.970
we were sitting there, You know, Bill's liked by a 
lot of folks, or known by a lot of folks, because

30:13.435 --> 30:24.825
he's a lawyer in Dallas, he's involved in a lot of 
civic activities up there, a very respected

30:13.435 --> 30:24.825
person. I said, you know, it's difficult. He said, 
you guys, y'all really like Bill. I said, yeah,

30:29.570 --> 30:31.251
because Bill's just one of the guys. I mean, you've 
got to understand that. And she did, you know, but

30:34.034 --> 30:42.261
there was a distinction between people, 
treatment of Bill here and Bill's treatment, say,

30:34.034 --> 30:42.261
in Dallas or something. But that was exactly the 
way it was. I thought there were a couple other

30:46.511 --> 30:50.376
black kids. I know there were a couple others that 
they did not graduate, but they left. And they may

30:53.460 --> 30:57.505
have had some treatment that was improper. I mean, 
one guy named Thompson.

31:02.051 --> 31:07.177
But Bill graduated, and you have to ask Bill if 
there was some discrimination. And I'm sure there

31:08.038 --> 31:09.160
probably was. But it wasn't

31:14.455 --> 31:17.163
to the point where we recommend it. That was with 
Fresh Fish Buddies, and I asked several friends

31:17.243 --> 31:28.836
that were in his outfit, and they never remarked 
back to me either.
