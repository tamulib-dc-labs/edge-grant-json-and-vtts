WEBVTT

00:00:02.478 --> 00:00:06.466
And you ask about style of teaching.

00:00:06.486 --> 00:00:15.846
Right up front in every class, unless I forgot to, I would describe to them the level of expectation

00:00:16.535 --> 00:00:24.351
One that you'd be in class, one that you'd be on time, and one that, hopefully, that you would be prepared.

00:00:25.673 --> 00:00:35.353
Also, in the first lecture, too, I would try to at least my view on how one gets prepared for university work as far as the time spent

00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:45.971
I know it sounds corny, but the day you take your notes, you review your notes that day, not three days later, that you've studied the text before you come to Clannis, not after.

00:00:46.592 --> 00:00:52.262
I'm not saying many of them did it, but this is what I would expect of them.

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:59.690
strongly suggest in the first day or two, I said, when we get into the end of the semester, you've not done well.

00:01:00.632 --> 00:01:07.964
You wait until the week before the term is over and not come in and say, oh, Dr. Bayless, what must I do to be saved?

00:01:09.307 --> 00:01:11.751
Because salvation will have passed you by by then.

00:01:12.532 --> 00:01:15.297
I said, I'm really not going to be sympathetic nor interested.

00:01:16.019 --> 00:01:31.315
Now, after the first exam, you come by and you talk with me, and I make my suggestion, and I feel that you're doing what you need to be doing, but do not wait until the last week and suddenly decide, oh, gee, I'm about to flunk this course, and I go cry on his shoulder.

00:01:31.916 --> 00:01:34.359
I said, I won't be sympathetic to you.

00:01:34.379 --> 00:01:42.287
Compare, in those first years, compare A&M students to what you learned about the Citadel students.

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:45.891
Well, let's see, I taught at UT as a TA.

00:01:46.647 --> 00:01:51.852
for four years or so, three, and then I went to Citadel and then here.

00:01:55.175 --> 00:01:58.798
Probably generally UT students were a little better prepared.

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:01.400
Citadel, not so prepared.

00:02:03.042 --> 00:02:06.705
A&M started somewhere in between.

00:02:07.886 --> 00:02:14.612
I had obviously very good students and mediocre and bad.

00:02:16.077 --> 00:02:25.048
You know, I hear people talk that this professor is hard and that professor is easy and this school is hard and this school is easy, whatever it is in these journals that people talk about.

00:02:25.068 --> 00:02:43.350
My own naive feeling was, wherever the student went to school, he or she could do well if they wanted to, whether it's at UT or the Citadel or at Texas A&M or TCU or wherever it may be.

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.606
And I think my comment now is going to be common.

00:02:47.626 --> 00:02:52.898
I remember very well one student said it all after he gave his paper back, pretty heavily marked out.

00:02:54.622 --> 00:03:02.680
He said, well, Professor Bayless, this is not an English class, it's a history class.

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.123
And you marked all this grammar.

00:03:04.812 --> 00:03:11.382
And I said, yes I did, because I expect you to be able to express yourself with this course.

00:03:11.822 --> 00:03:21.216
And I think when you get out of the Citadel and you're employed, that employer's not going to wonder whether you were this major or that major.

00:03:21.236 --> 00:03:31.191
He wants to know how you can express yourself and how you can communicate.

00:03:31.846 --> 00:03:41.720
I never did feel that our A&M students were doing that much better or that much worse than these other institutions.

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:53.736
Did you, in your first months here, did you find much difference in the military style of the students here compared to the Citadel?

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:02.352
everybody was uniformed as they were here, but each class section was a military unit.

00:04:04.095 --> 00:04:14.774
And there was a squad leader who marched into the class and when you walked in, he called the class to attention and after you nodded, then he said, seats.

00:04:16.116 --> 00:04:19.943
And so that was much like West Point or Annapolis.

00:04:20.193 --> 00:04:24.140
and also at the Citadel, all faculty wore uniform.

00:04:25.242 --> 00:04:30.010
And your military rank at the Citadel was?

00:04:30.972 --> 00:04:33.276
Well, it was mixed.

00:04:34.378 --> 00:04:38.185
As a retired naval officer, I could have worn

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:43.555
the uniform, the Navy uniform.

00:04:43.575 --> 00:04:46.138
In fact the Registrar did, he was the only one who did.

00:04:46.198 --> 00:04:52.086
But I went out and bought a used Army uniform from a guy who was leaving, I learned about.

00:04:53.988 --> 00:04:56.792
And you have two ranks.

00:04:56.932 --> 00:05:01.438
I was an assistant professor of history and I was a second lieutenant.

00:05:01.823 --> 00:05:05.307
in the South Carolina Unorganized Militia.

00:05:05.808 --> 00:05:09.733
And if you look at the acronym, what does it come out?

00:05:09.753 --> 00:05:10.954
S-C-U-M.

00:05:10.974 --> 00:05:15.620
But all faculty, like the department heads, were usually lieutenant colonels and colonels.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:26.633
However, when I went there, major anger was the department head, because the other one had recently died, and he was soon promoted to lieutenant colonel.

00:05:27.794 --> 00:05:31.077
You had both patrol rank in the Citadel and military rank.

00:05:31.538 --> 00:05:33.960
So it was more military there than here.

00:05:34.961 --> 00:05:36.763
Much more.

00:05:36.783 --> 00:05:45.051
How did you and Mary Evelyn become a part of the department's community, social life activities?

00:05:45.531 --> 00:05:46.492
In which place?

00:05:46.512 --> 00:05:46.712
Here.

00:05:48.114 --> 00:05:50.276
Just one other comment about the Citadel.

00:05:50.296 --> 00:05:52.078
I should have said it earlier.

00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:55.641
At the Citadel,

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:59.633
One of the first things you did was get your cards.

00:06:02.976 --> 00:06:07.661
And here's Garland, Baylor, Sutton, and everybody had their cards.

00:06:08.341 --> 00:06:13.106
And on Sunday afternoon the department head called on his faculty members.

00:06:13.907 --> 00:06:19.672
And outside your door you had a pedestal with a basket of the cards in case you were not home.

00:06:20.853 --> 00:06:26.539
And sometimes you didn't mind being home and sometimes you made a point not to be home.

00:06:27.194 --> 00:06:32.660
but the department and his wife would call on you, and they would each leave their cards.

00:06:35.943 --> 00:06:44.332
But as indicated earlier, since we were living in faculty housing, we immediately had a support group, and that was very nice.

00:06:45.113 --> 00:06:56.745
Here, and I'm sorry to say, I think it's changed as we've gotten bigger, but it was very easy to integrate social with the department here for many, many, many, many years.

00:06:57.468 --> 00:07:05.018
I always felt the Department of History at Extendium was a socially and economically and academically compatible group.

00:07:05.739 --> 00:07:11.167
We had very, very little personal conflicts or personality things.

00:07:12.328 --> 00:07:21.160
Sure, we'd get hacked at one another occasionally on something, but always you felt that we supported each other.

00:07:21.481 --> 00:07:24.825
We'd hear new facts that come in, we'd meet them, we'd help them get a Senate.

00:07:25.042 --> 00:07:50.442
set up we'd take them to their place or show them how to get there or or whatever and you you tend to take an interest in your new colleagues not just an academic interest but a personal and social interest i'm not sure in fact i think that it pretty much died before i retired in 86. did people help you all when you arrived uh and i remember several that we helped

00:07:50.708 --> 00:08:01.578
Do you remember some early parties that you all went to or receptions or picnics?

00:08:01.598 --> 00:08:02.839
Did the Steens have any?

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:05.242
I don't remember the Steens having much.

00:08:05.262 --> 00:08:06.102
The Nances did.

00:08:06.122 --> 00:08:09.766
And the way the Nances tended to be more social than the Steens.

00:08:11.868 --> 00:08:16.372
Did any faculty member give you advice about anything in the early years?

00:08:16.412 --> 00:08:18.594
Not particularly as you asked.

00:08:18.614 --> 00:08:20.496
Someone else may have told you this.

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:28.875
Was it, let's see, which election party?

00:08:28.895 --> 00:08:30.218
Was President in place 60 or 62?

00:08:30.238 --> 00:08:30.438
60.

00:08:30.458 --> 00:08:32.623
60.

00:08:33.805 --> 00:08:34.907
Kennedy, Nixon.

00:08:35.562 --> 00:08:39.085
Were you there at someone's party?

00:08:39.125 --> 00:08:40.446
The whole department was there.

00:08:41.427 --> 00:08:47.312
And someone put evergreen or ever, that 190 proof alcohol in the punch.

00:08:48.453 --> 00:08:51.055
And several senior people got sick.

00:08:51.456 --> 00:08:52.397
One never got home.

00:08:52.417 --> 00:08:55.940
I remember whose house it was.

00:08:56.841 --> 00:09:02.525
I can visualize the house, but it was an election party for the election in 1960.

00:09:03.286 --> 00:09:05.468
And some unknown person

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:07.702
Spike the punch.

00:09:13.049 --> 00:09:20.860
But no one either in the department or from some other department told y'all, here are some things you need to know, don't do this?

00:09:21.021 --> 00:09:22.443
I can't remember.

00:09:22.463 --> 00:09:26.208
You weren't told to join a certain church or not to attend?

00:09:26.228 --> 00:09:31.155
No, I don't remember anything like that.

00:09:31.175 --> 00:09:33.919
Well, what groups did y'all quickly associate with

00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:39.721
separate from the department?

00:09:41.183 --> 00:09:43.184
Me and the church went to A&M Methodist Church.

00:09:43.805 --> 00:09:44.526
Did you join it?

00:09:44.666 --> 00:09:45.346
Yeah.

00:09:45.366 --> 00:09:45.727
Okay.

00:09:45.747 --> 00:09:47.808
We later moved to First Methodist downtown.

00:09:48.709 --> 00:09:55.215
I was in 67 when we made the change, but we went to A&M Methodist when we came in 56.

00:09:55.235 --> 00:09:56.016
Anything else?

00:09:56.156 --> 00:10:04.243
Then after we built that house, second house on the... No, we built the house on Briar Oaks.

00:10:04.679 --> 00:10:11.546
is when we moved to First Methodist downtown.

00:10:11.566 --> 00:10:13.373
That's interesting on the question

00:10:14.821 --> 00:10:19.428
As a new faculty member, I really don't remember them saying.

00:10:19.989 --> 00:10:20.570
Don't do this.

00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:22.833
Don't do that.

00:10:24.335 --> 00:10:25.197
Okay.

00:10:25.297 --> 00:10:27.180
Dr. Steen left in 58.

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:27.761
58.

00:10:29.343 --> 00:10:37.275
And do you remember anything in the department, any shifts or any events when Dr. Nance took over?

00:10:38.937 --> 00:10:40.139
How did you all feel?

00:10:40.219 --> 00:10:40.660
Before Ralph left.

00:10:42.074 --> 00:10:45.880
I said, Rapp, are you going to take anybody with you?

00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:48.924
And he looked at me and said, I'm not going to take any of these criminals anywhere.

00:10:50.807 --> 00:10:53.311
Now whether he had a chance or wanted to, I don't know.

00:10:53.331 --> 00:10:54.092
That was on his copy.

00:10:57.197 --> 00:11:06.951
After he left, the Milton McCain Department had, as I've indicated earlier, Milton was a little bit tougher, sterner, not quite as approachable.

00:11:07.842 --> 00:11:32.820
was there any as far as you know any departmental involvement in the selection of dr nance not to my knowledge of course remember this is i'm here two years in very junior and i don't remember do you remember any reaction by the senior faculty in his selection and as far as you did hearts or al or tom

00:11:33.745 --> 00:11:42.745
As far as y'all were aware, who made the decision that he would be the department head?

00:11:47.195 --> 00:11:53.509
It's just before Hubert, one year.

00:11:55.278 --> 00:12:02.076
All I know is where the dean was said that he is the new department.

00:12:02.296 --> 00:12:07.289
I'm sure that he must have obviously visited with the president.

00:12:08.392 --> 00:12:09.816
There wasn't a party or anything.

00:12:09.836 --> 00:12:11.059
It was there to

00:12:12.119 --> 00:12:28.615
Then Dr. Hubert came as the dean in the fall of 59 and Rutter is the new president.

00:12:29.416 --> 00:12:32.098
Do you recall any particular changes then?

00:12:32.539 --> 00:12:36.903
Within the department?

00:12:36.923 --> 00:12:38.084
Or within A&M?

00:12:39.886 --> 00:12:42.008
When did the department move over to Nagel Hall?

00:12:44.722 --> 00:12:46.705
Because they're there, I know, in the fall of 59.

00:12:52.253 --> 00:12:52.794
Was Steen?

00:12:53.395 --> 00:12:56.600
No, Steen, we were still in academics.

00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:00.485
So it must have been in that summer of 58, 59.

00:13:00.505 --> 00:13:02.248
You came in August.

00:13:02.268 --> 00:13:02.769
Of 59.

00:13:02.949 --> 00:13:05.813
And we were already in Nagel.

00:13:05.893 --> 00:13:09.058
It must have been that spring.

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:17.208
See, I usually remember walking into the office and not getting anything, how it was set up.

00:13:18.109 --> 00:13:24.721
But once we got over into Nagel, of course you know in Nagel, we had no telephones.

00:13:24.741 --> 00:13:34.337
And I don't remember the first, but at the end of each hall, Wesley, what's his name, in Poli-Sci, Wesley?

00:13:34.857 --> 00:13:39.874
Tell me the phone was in his office just outside his office.

00:13:39.894 --> 00:13:43.065
And if it rang, then you'd have to run down to the governor's room and go answer it.

00:13:43.125 --> 00:13:46.858
When y'all moved to Nagel, who decided who got what office?

00:13:47.058 --> 00:13:58.752
because I had a very nice office and I was sharing it with the former department head, Dr. Gammon.

00:13:59.753 --> 00:14:01.655
It was one of those larger offices.

00:14:01.916 --> 00:14:06.381
We had two desks, one for me and one for Dr. Gammon, and he showed up occasionally.

00:14:06.401 --> 00:14:08.183
And you were right at the head of the stairway.

00:14:08.784 --> 00:14:16.373
And there were a number of new, you came in 56,

00:14:16.741 --> 00:14:19.244
And the department grew a little each year, didn't it?

00:14:21.146 --> 00:14:23.249
Of course, I had a big influx in 56.

00:14:25.031 --> 00:14:26.413
Was Frazier here when you came?

00:14:26.973 --> 00:14:27.294
Yes.

00:14:27.634 --> 00:14:29.396
So he must have been added in 59.

00:14:29.416 --> 00:14:31.779
Frazier and Wines.

00:14:33.461 --> 00:14:35.123
I think they were both added in 58.

00:14:36.104 --> 00:14:37.266
And I was the only...

00:14:37.286 --> 00:14:38.327
I don't remember about in 57.

00:14:38.442 --> 00:14:42.707
I was the only new person in 59 in history.

00:14:42.727 --> 00:14:46.171
There was another new... Was Benton here when you came?

00:14:46.311 --> 00:14:47.633
Yes, yes.

00:14:47.653 --> 00:14:50.956
Describe, describe Dr. Benton.

00:14:50.976 --> 00:14:51.397
Wilburn.

00:14:57.444 --> 00:15:05.293
Since we were a joint history and government, history and public side, history and government, a number of the faculty

00:15:06.522 --> 00:15:12.309
in the department were exclusively government, though there were some in history who also taught government.

00:15:12.869 --> 00:15:16.393
Claude Hall, for example, you know, they always taught a section of government.

00:15:16.413 --> 00:15:17.034
I never did.

00:15:17.354 --> 00:15:17.775
Did you?

00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:24.843
Gene Benton.

00:15:25.583 --> 00:15:27.506
He was head of the SMU.

00:15:27.526 --> 00:15:29.848
Did he come directly from SMU?

00:15:32.751 --> 00:15:34.133
Gene Benton was

00:15:34.568 --> 00:15:40.779
They usually were probably one of the characters in the government side of this.

00:15:42.963 --> 00:15:51.017
Tall, lanky, very competent, except he drove his students nuts.

00:15:51.037 --> 00:15:53.421
I don't know if this is fair to say to them or not.

00:15:54.835 --> 00:16:01.569
interest enough, where he just ran into his wife the first time, and they were forever married, I was somewhere, and I finally recognized her.

00:16:01.589 --> 00:16:11.671
I'd seen her, I didn't know anything about her.

00:16:11.691 --> 00:16:12.813
What was his name?

00:16:12.974 --> 00:16:14.076
Blue Book Benton.

00:16:15.811 --> 00:16:17.073
We all used Blue Book.

00:16:17.093 --> 00:16:19.538
I'm not sure why he was designated as that.

00:16:22.263 --> 00:16:34.465
Rather demanding, but he tended to, I think, read his lectures more than we always did.

00:16:34.485 --> 00:16:38.933
Students used to try to avoid Gene, but I think once they got in with him,

00:16:39.638 --> 00:16:45.025
based on what they heard, once they got in with him, they tended to stay with him.

00:16:45.045 --> 00:16:48.890
And I've known several who would take several courses with Gene.

00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:53.836
Of course, I had that opportunity later when I was a senior department advisor before they got their divorce.

00:16:53.856 --> 00:17:00.564
And I could tend to see where students would tend to, who they would want to get, who they're trying to avoid.

00:17:01.185 --> 00:17:02.727
I personally like Gene.

00:17:02.977 --> 00:17:18.240
The one time I was chairman of the Liberal Arts Council, and Gene was on there, and I always found it amusing we were highly starved until Gene would make a motion to adjourn.

00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:21.945
I don't think he liked committee meetings.

00:17:23.507 --> 00:17:29.536
One other person on this is strictly a version of it.

00:17:29.556 --> 00:17:32.781
It was Dick Ballinger on that same Liberal Arts Council.

00:17:33.250 --> 00:17:40.880
And as an English prof, it took him more words to say something that most people that I knew.

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:42.742
But again, I liked it.

00:17:42.782 --> 00:17:46.687
We used to have calls and see it quite often.

00:17:46.707 --> 00:17:54.837
Of course, the bigger changes obviously came when we started out with really, really a rapid growth.

00:17:56.065 --> 00:17:58.668
I guess it was 78.

00:17:58.688 --> 00:18:02.832
Have you identified when we were doing that 15% or 20% a year?

00:18:03.052 --> 00:18:04.053
Oh, it was earlier than that.

00:18:05.014 --> 00:18:06.576
We ran it, what, through 85, 86?

00:18:06.596 --> 00:18:07.617
Yeah, yeah.

00:18:08.138 --> 00:18:10.920
But let's stay with the stable years first.

00:18:11.461 --> 00:18:14.845
Describe the department in Nagel.

00:18:15.205 --> 00:18:17.928
Describe the physical setting for the department.

00:18:17.948 --> 00:18:20.210
What else was in Nagel, and where was history in government?

00:18:21.091 --> 00:18:24.975
Well, economics for a while was on the first floor.

00:18:25.529 --> 00:18:36.547
We shared second and part of three, part of three with geography, because there were only three people in geography then.

00:18:37.348 --> 00:18:38.009
Ed Duran.

00:18:39.732 --> 00:18:40.634
Skipper Schleselman.

00:18:41.295 --> 00:18:44.921
But he had his office over in academic and social dean.

00:18:45.542 --> 00:18:51.351
But the dean's office was on the second floor of Nagel that first year.

00:18:53.035 --> 00:18:53.996
In the middle, right there.

00:18:54.017 --> 00:18:55.939
Was that before they moved over too?

00:18:55.959 --> 00:18:56.120
Uh-huh.

00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:57.862
Okay, that's right.

00:18:57.882 --> 00:18:59.204
And then who was the other guy?

00:18:59.225 --> 00:19:03.872
I can't, NGRV, I can't remember.

00:19:04.012 --> 00:19:09.420
I can picture him coming up, down the corner, up across from mine.

00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:11.263
No air control, obviously.

00:19:15.496 --> 00:19:17.999
When did air conditioning come?

00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:19.201
A long time after that.

00:19:19.301 --> 00:19:19.722
After that.

00:19:20.823 --> 00:19:22.145
I remember the number.

00:19:22.185 --> 00:19:25.730
It cost $500,000 to build Academic Building in 1912.

00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:27.633
Is that when it was built?

00:19:27.653 --> 00:19:28.794
I think so.

00:19:28.895 --> 00:19:32.319
And it cost more than that to air condition it in whatever year.

00:19:33.942 --> 00:19:42.814
I do not know the cost on building Naval, but I heard the cost to air condition it.

00:19:42.834 --> 00:19:44.997
No telephones, no elevators.

00:19:46.006 --> 00:19:47.748
completely in the side.

00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:56.420
I'd have knee surgery and also third floor and going up those stairs on crutches was not very much fun.

00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:57.641
Let's see, what about parking?

00:19:58.102 --> 00:19:58.963
Where did you park?

00:20:00.265 --> 00:20:02.908
Well, remember initially there was no fee to park.

00:20:02.928 --> 00:20:05.892
Then it went to fifty cents and three dollars into five dollars.

00:20:06.593 --> 00:20:06.934
A year?

00:20:07.755 --> 00:20:12.882
Then it skyrocketed and we were all complaining that here is our job.

00:20:12.902 --> 00:20:15.405
Well, at one time we parked on the

00:20:15.942 --> 00:20:23.251
In academia, our parking was on the, what direction is that towards Harrington?

00:20:23.271 --> 00:20:23.992
East side.

00:20:24.012 --> 00:20:26.275
East side, there was a parking garage where Harrington is.

00:20:27.256 --> 00:20:35.747
Where the parking lot outside of Naco was and is still there, and that's where we parked.

00:20:35.767 --> 00:20:45.780
When I was in B Hall, which I think is the name of Richmond, where my first office was, we parked where Harrington is now in that parking garage.

00:20:46.385 --> 00:20:55.299
We shared the Nago parking lot with physics, when they were in the physics building, and with economics and geography.

00:20:57.603 --> 00:21:00.307
Was anyone else in that Nago for a while?

00:21:00.327 --> 00:21:00.808
Economics?

00:21:01.208 --> 00:21:02.731
Journalism was in the basement.

00:21:03.331 --> 00:21:05.595
In the basement, that's right.

00:21:05.615 --> 00:21:09.181
In the department, was there a coffee pot?

00:21:09.221 --> 00:21:11.885
Where did the department drink coffee in the 60s?

00:21:13.167 --> 00:21:13.928
MSC?

00:21:14.718 --> 00:21:20.124
I don't ever remember a coffee pot in any other place.

00:21:20.244 --> 00:21:21.606
I don't think Dr. Nance allowed it.

00:21:21.686 --> 00:21:25.450
And I guess to me it's sort of a sad thing.

00:21:27.252 --> 00:21:37.164
We'd go to MSC at 9.30, 10.30 in the morning when it was appropriate.

00:21:37.184 --> 00:21:40.928
And I'm not sure that people do that anymore, but I think an awful lot of our

00:21:41.667 --> 00:21:45.377
understanding of each other took place there.

00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:47.903
Or later over to Visa.

00:21:48.766 --> 00:21:50.871
Every once in a while I run into George Carter.

00:21:50.992 --> 00:21:52.255
In fact, I saw him at the airport.

00:21:52.295 --> 00:21:53.699
We didn't talk, but I saw him there.

00:21:54.561 --> 00:21:56.065
And he still laments that

00:21:57.007 --> 00:22:16.382
not meeting over from economic, from poli-sci, from history, from what you first referred to, predominantly from history, but later expanded and whoever showed up.

00:22:16.362 --> 00:22:43.095
Describe how you feel, if you feel so, was there a kind of a community feeling on campus then?

00:22:49.741 --> 00:22:52.367
With friends and other departments and other colleges?

00:22:52.387 --> 00:22:53.558
Very much so.

00:22:56.322 --> 00:22:58.185
I was there to always look at and embarrass people.

00:22:58.746 --> 00:23:00.649
I mean, well, you know so and so in what department.

00:23:00.669 --> 00:23:03.733
I said, no, I know somebody else in that department.

00:23:03.753 --> 00:23:24.405
Because I thought, at least from my view, not only liberal arts and the sciences as well, maybe not quite as much as engineering, because they're a little bit alternate, but there was this feeling of, I would say, comradeship, collegiality, whatever word you want, not only within history and economics

00:23:24.638 --> 00:23:33.631
polysci and English, but all the way to geosciences and science, maybe a little bit of engineering.

00:23:33.951 --> 00:23:39.900
They did not tend, didn't see me in engineering, in MSC or in species that I can remember.

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:41.021
Do you?

00:23:41.041 --> 00:23:41.662
I mean in ag.

00:23:42.343 --> 00:23:42.723
That's right.

00:23:42.744 --> 00:23:46.208
From the other areas, pretty much so.

00:23:46.789 --> 00:23:54.460
In your first years here, was there anyone in the department or elsewhere to whom you turned for advice?

00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:58.382
What do I do about this?

00:24:00.425 --> 00:24:02.468
How do I solve this problem?

00:24:05.173 --> 00:24:08.037
Well, maybe I'm naive and didn't have too many problems.

00:24:08.057 --> 00:24:13.265
I did talk to Horace Bass some since he'd been around.

00:24:13.325 --> 00:24:24.362
Paul was not much older in the department than me, so he probably more so within those who came at the same time.

00:24:24.697 --> 00:24:28.083
Ashcroft and Taylor, and later you.

00:24:30.527 --> 00:24:35.595
Talked to Frazier a good bit, not so much for advice, just to visit with.

00:24:36.416 --> 00:24:41.845
Ryan, because we were in the reserve together there for a while, so I came to visit with him a good bit.

00:24:42.348 --> 00:24:46.953
Now, there were faculty nicknames that the students created.

00:24:48.936 --> 00:24:50.538
Share as many as you can recall.

00:24:51.178 --> 00:24:53.561
Well, I've always wondered if I had one and didn't know it.

00:24:54.002 --> 00:24:54.723
Oh, I never heard it.

00:24:55.223 --> 00:24:55.924
I never heard.

00:24:55.944 --> 00:24:57.666
I never heard one from you.

00:24:58.908 --> 00:25:05.976
I mentioned Gene.

00:25:06.462 --> 00:25:09.025
Blue Book, Notes Nance.

00:25:10.127 --> 00:25:10.688
Because?

00:25:11.729 --> 00:25:14.052
They tended to read his lecture.

00:25:15.454 --> 00:25:17.196
Harris, he had a nickname.

00:25:18.297 --> 00:25:20.280
What was his first name?

00:25:21.522 --> 00:25:22.443
It wasn't Bill Harris.

00:25:26.929 --> 00:25:27.770
I cannot think of it.

00:25:27.790 --> 00:25:30.293
I can't remember his first name either.

00:25:32.197 --> 00:25:38.046
Lloyd Taylor had several machine gun, high pockets, Abbey lead.

00:25:38.066 --> 00:25:41.652
As far as I know, he had at least three that I knew of.

00:25:43.655 --> 00:25:48.984
And each of those, machine gun was because they thought he talked fast.

00:25:49.044 --> 00:25:53.431
Rapidity, no notes, just unloaded.

00:25:53.451 --> 00:25:58.980
High pockets because he always wore penny loafers, white socks, and gray pants.

00:25:59.855 --> 00:26:05.364
I guess to somebody's view, his pants were short enough to walk along and see his white socks.

00:26:05.384 --> 00:26:08.790
I never saw anything on him except white socks.

00:26:08.810 --> 00:26:19.609
And then the Ivy League, because they thought that his dress style... His dress style, in fact, he was from the East, though Lehigh was not an Ivy League.

00:26:19.629 --> 00:26:22.133
I don't think they knew where he was from.

00:26:22.602 --> 00:26:25.985
Do you think of any other?

00:26:26.225 --> 00:26:27.526
Did Alan Ashcraft have one?

00:26:27.566 --> 00:26:28.207
I don't remember.

00:26:28.828 --> 00:26:30.489
Claude Hall, I don't remember one.

00:26:30.529 --> 00:26:31.530
Tom Miller, I don't.

00:26:33.592 --> 00:26:35.453
Tom Duncan, John Duncan.

00:26:36.314 --> 00:26:37.475
I don't remember one for him.

00:26:37.735 --> 00:26:40.077
He was another senior man I mentioned before.

00:26:40.198 --> 00:26:41.459
What was his specialty?

00:26:43.741 --> 00:26:44.581
It was US, wasn't it?

00:26:45.122 --> 00:26:45.382
It was US.

00:26:46.383 --> 00:26:51.968
John was also one who thought he was not given a fair shake by the administration.

00:26:53.770 --> 00:27:02.402
Like he was probably more bitter because of his feeling on that.

00:27:02.822 --> 00:27:05.146
And I don't know whether it's right or wrong about his feeling.

00:27:05.626 --> 00:27:09.532
I just know that he felt bitter and hurt that he was not recognized.

00:27:10.773 --> 00:27:19.305
How did you come to understand and what were your feelings about Aggie traditions?

00:27:21.378 --> 00:27:25.166
Yale practice and all.

00:27:25.246 --> 00:27:31.739
You know, coming from the city with a heavy military tradition, I was not surprised by some.

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:34.003
And I had been already

00:27:36.818 --> 00:27:49.416
the word is not indoctrinate, but at Arkansas A&M at Monticello in the B-12 program, we ended up with students from all over the Southwest Conference, including Aggies.

00:27:49.436 --> 00:27:56.606
And it was from those who were at Monticello, Arkansas, that I learned about Babbo bombs.

00:27:59.030 --> 00:28:04.918
And I'm sure some old Aggies told you about those, where you take a can of Babbo

00:28:05.270 --> 00:28:19.926
cut a hole in the top, put a 5 or 6 inch firecracker in it, set it off, throw it in someone's room, hold the door, and I cannot imagine cleaning up the stuff from an exploded can.

00:28:19.946 --> 00:28:21.127
The other was drowned out.

00:28:23.850 --> 00:28:34.281
And again, this is not germane to Texas A&M, but to our A&M, one of the Texas A&M Aggies decided to drown out one of his buddies in a modified way

00:28:35.054 --> 00:28:54.060
The doors were made out of ledge stone, and he was on the third floor, opened a window in the hall, trying to walk along the ledge stone with one hand and carrying a bucket in the other to the next window to throw it in on his buddy, and the process fell three stories.

00:28:55.362 --> 00:29:00.589
Fortunately, he hit some bushes that messed up, mad cuts on his head.

00:29:00.805 --> 00:29:05.852
and messed up his right foot and ankle to where he had to be discharged from the Marine Corps.

00:29:07.354 --> 00:29:12.861
But talking with others who've made any of this is how it was indoctrinated.

00:29:14.403 --> 00:29:24.636
And I guess being indoctrinated to the average tradition was rather gradual on my part, but it came to be a real reality when

00:29:26.168 --> 00:29:41.194
As Director of Academic Services, I had a graduate student in education from North Carolina who was working for me, and she was telling me how corny she thought many of our traditions were.

00:29:42.056 --> 00:29:48.167
But within the year, she was the most dedicated Aggie that I've ever known.

00:29:48.988 --> 00:29:50.691
And there's something in the

00:29:51.785 --> 00:29:55.652
perhaps even unobtrusive indoctrination that happens to people.

00:29:56.894 --> 00:30:08.655
And I've seen many like her change, that when they come here, they couldn't wait to leave because they thought that so much that was done here was corny or hokey or whatever.

00:30:09.596 --> 00:30:15.767
And I guess as much as anything, what I miss out today, miss today, or I did before, is the whipping out.

00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:17.822
which is almost a thing of the past.

00:30:19.084 --> 00:30:22.408
And I guess in part because the Corps is now such a small part.

00:30:23.149 --> 00:30:37.907
But in that transition from all Corps to Corps non-regs to women, I think even for a long time after the Corps became non-compulsory, others picked up on it as well.

00:30:38.579 --> 00:30:45.470
When you first arrived, did you have any guesstimate as to how long you were going to be here?

00:30:45.931 --> 00:30:46.732
Not to follow this.

00:30:47.673 --> 00:30:50.718
So you didn't have any plan to either stay or not to stay?

00:30:50.879 --> 00:30:51.179
Not to stay.

00:30:51.199 --> 00:30:51.720
I just came.

00:30:53.262 --> 00:30:54.104
Did you remember?

00:30:54.124 --> 00:31:02.477
As you well know, for much of the, I guess, 60s, early 70s, we had an enormous turnover.

00:31:05.041 --> 00:31:06.223
And a lot of those who...

00:31:07.587 --> 00:31:16.132
either got better offers or just couldn't adapt to what they perceived to be our system, especially the headship.
