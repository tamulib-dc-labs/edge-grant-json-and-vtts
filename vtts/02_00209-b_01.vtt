WEBVTT

00:03.305 --> 00:14.310
Trying to figure out, trying to figure out, trying 
to figure out what has gone wrong with this machine

00:03.305 --> 00:14.310
hoping that everything is now working.

00:34.304 --> 00:38.850
Okay, we're talking about your freshman football 
time. Manning Smith was the... He was the head

00:41.593 --> 00:49.243
freshman football coach, and he used mostly, if 
not all, graduate students. For example, there

00:49.263 --> 00:51.486
was a guy here named Dog Dawson. Do you remember 
him? Well, I remember him. Well, he had played

00:54.931 --> 01:01.519
varsity football the year before, but he was like a 
five-year student. And he was the... assistant, a

01:05.000 --> 01:08.263
guy named Bill Buchanan was. So mostly all of them, 
Jim Connection was one. They were the coaches. All

01:15.890 --> 01:18.012
we did as freshmen was just gun fodder. Gun fodder 
for the varsity. And you all played five games, six

01:21.034 --> 01:23.977
games? Yeah, we played Allen Academy and we played 
Arlington. And we played probably five or six

01:28.922 --> 01:34.226
games, yeah. The Hey, the

01:36.151 --> 01:47.906
Varsity Stars, let's see, Kimbrough was gone, 
wasn't he? Kimbrough was gone. The Varsity Stars

01:48.848 --> 01:50.630
were Mosier. Knatzer. Pugh. No, Pugh was gone. 
Pugh was gone. Bill Knatzer from Denison. Yeah.

01:58.881 --> 02:02.346
Jim Sterling from... Oh, yeah. ...Pex O'Connor. 
Mm-hmm. Um... Whiskey Cure was one of them. And you

02:11.534 --> 02:14.818
all ran offensively, what was the formation? 
Single wing, double wing, and box. Pete hadn't

02:17.020 --> 02:18.281
come in yet. And you ran,

02:18.301 --> 02:23.967
pass plays would be one out of four. TC is the only 
one that threw much of the ball. The workouts

02:29.132 --> 02:33.817
normally began about what? Describe a typical 
workout. not on a Monday or Friday. We would go out

02:42.074 --> 02:47.760
and first they'd loosen up in calisthenics, which 
they don't do much anymore, they do stretching.

02:48.201 --> 02:55.089
We'd do calisthenics, then we'd break down into 
offense would go over and rush home. Line

02:55.309 --> 03:06.823
blocking, the punters would punt, the pass 
receivers and the quarterback would practice

02:55.309 --> 03:06.823
catching and throwing the ball, and then they'd 
Forrest would call up, we need so many guys, they'd

03:07.158 --> 03:10.023
send us over there. Haskell, Bear Bryant did a lot 
of things, but I think what he did mostly, he

03:11.765 --> 03:18.276
changed the whole routine of workouts. He went to 
the county fair times. We didn't have that before.

03:21.922 --> 03:24.085
He had a group over here doing this, a group doing 
this. Now, for example, if we had blocking,

03:24.165 --> 03:31.818
one-on-one blocking linemen, we'd have 
one-on-one blocking everybody that's standing

03:24.165 --> 03:31.818
watching. Mm-hmm. or if we had punting or pass, you 
see, he broke it down to where everybody was

03:32.335 --> 03:38.882
working all the time. And that dad that got out into 
all the high schools, that was the biggest change,

03:38.962 --> 03:47.211
I think, that and defense, pursuit and defense. 
Used to, if you got through the first line at the

03:47.231 --> 03:52.577
last green, you wasn't going to get tackled by a 
line. But Brian got pursuit. What kind of defense

03:54.079 --> 03:55.861
did y'all run? 6-2-2-1? What they did in those 
days, believe it or not, the center would come up

03:57.002 --> 04:02.308
the line of skinnings And he'd wait seven-man 
line, six-man line, five-man line. The defense

04:06.950 --> 04:08.152
set up. Long time before the huddle got up or what 
they don't do anymore. So they knew what you could

04:12.841 --> 04:14.524
do. And then whatever defense he called, that 
changed. what kind of blocking you were going to do

04:18.927 --> 04:21.790
on the guy. And they always did two on one blocking. 
High and low. Hit them high, hit them low, hit them

04:26.474 --> 04:29.337
low, let them go, that kind of stuff. It was not this 
brush blocking or just getting them out of the way.

04:32.820 --> 04:36.143
You had to put your man on the ground, which was very 
difficult to do. And there were, what, six or seven

04:37.544 --> 04:43.970
varsity coaches? Yeah, probably, yeah. Bill 
James, Uncle Bill James, he was the line coach. And

04:51.773 --> 04:55.077
one of these guys, he's kind of like a man named Bill 
Lance. Uncle Bill had come here from Texas. And he

04:57.539 --> 05:03.646
was the one that owned Camp Stewart, this boy's 
camp down in Kerrville, the famous camp down

04:57.539 --> 05:03.646
there. That was his camp. So he just coached and he 
wasn't even faculty. And then we had some others

05:08.130 --> 05:09.952
there. I think what happened here, the war was on. 
And one day a guy would be here and the next day he's

05:15.003 --> 05:17.569
gone. We'd have students one day and they'd be 
gone. So they kept moving them all out. Older

05:21.919 --> 05:24.384
coaches like Norton and Uncle Bill don't always 
stay here. Marty Caroll. Where were you when you

05:27.111 --> 05:30.759
heard the news on December 7th? I was walking back 
from D. Warefield House. One Sunday, I'd been at a

05:33.464 --> 05:36.167
clean basket. Did somebody tell you or what? I 
guess somebody said we're in war. Of course, we

05:39.010 --> 05:40.812
knew the war was coming. But they said to bomb Pearl 
Harbor. Nobody knew where Pearl Harbor was. Well,

05:44.556 --> 05:45.717
so what's Pearl Harbor? And where did you, after 
you heard that, what did you do? Where did you go?

05:51.224 --> 05:53.506
Well, I went on back to my dorm and went out to eat. We 
just said, we weren't shocked, I don't think,

05:53.546 --> 05:58.932
because we kind of felt like we were going to get in 
the war. But we didn't know. We were so dumb. We

06:02.011 --> 06:03.252
didn't know what war was. We'd never been in war. We 
didn't know what the aftermath was going to be. And

06:06.616 --> 06:07.818
a lot of guys got excited. You know, gung-ho. I want 
to go. I want to go. I want to go. They didn't know the

06:10.941 --> 06:13.004
horrors of war. All right. Let's go back to this 
freshman year. Other than being a room orderly and

06:19.972 --> 06:23.957
so forth, what were some other hazings? that you 
endured your freshman year? Well, I don't know if

06:25.830 --> 06:27.912
you call that. We couldn't walk on the sidewalk. We 
had to walk in the street. If we were walking down

06:31.016 --> 06:37.765
the street and we saw a member of our outfit with 
somebody, we had to go over and stop. You know, I'm

06:37.785 --> 06:39.086
outtie. I'm fish well, so-and-so, so-and-so, 
so-and-so. Or if we were walking down the street

06:41.529 --> 06:49.559
and we didn't speak to somebody, say, I didn't 
speak to you and you were B Infantry, you didn't eat

06:41.529 --> 06:49.559
my butt out. You tore my outfit. Say, oh. They would 
call me. We didn't, they, upperclassmen did not

06:53.084 --> 06:56.810
mess with other people's freshmen. We walked in 
the street. Lots of times we couldn't eat until all

06:58.433 --> 07:01.317
the upperclassmen had been served. Sometimes 
we'd have to eat under the table. And what we'd do,

07:03.982 --> 07:05.765
we'd hang around the upperclassmen. Like that 
second meal, you saw my wife go. Then we could go get

07:07.929 --> 07:11.354
kush off of these adjoining tables, but we 
couldn't get it. Now you ate in Duncan. We ate in

07:13.338 --> 07:13.919
Duncan. Had separate tables. All right. You 
athletes... Did you all eat at the same time as

07:17.583 --> 07:19.886
everyone else? Yes, same time. And you ate the same 
food? A little bit better, maybe. For example,

07:24.153 --> 07:27.638
they'd set a crate of milk at the end of our table. We 
could make that. And then we had our after-meal

07:29.100 --> 07:33.407
games in there, too, which was, you know, pretty 
good. We ate the same food, but we got a little bit,

07:33.427 --> 07:36.972
maybe a few extras in there. And as a freshman, you 
had one roommate? Had one roommate, a guy named

07:43.202 --> 07:45.345
Vernon Bell, too. And so y'all learned all of the 
Aggie lingo. We had to learn all that just like

07:50.316 --> 07:51.818
everybody else. Just like everybody else. All 
right. Do you remember any notable freshman, any

07:53.961 --> 07:59.609
notable pranks your freshman year? Yes. Air out. 
You know what air out is? Sure. Okay, we had air out

08:03.174 --> 08:07.801
where they would come through the dorm at midnight 
or so and air out. Well, you climbed out the windows

08:07.821 --> 08:10.945
and you were out for the rest of the night. And we'd 
go down there to the flying center, where the golf

08:11.178 --> 08:15.564
course is now. We'd have to sleep down there. Or one 
of the things is the drownouts were terrible. What

08:23.414 --> 08:28.561
they'd do, they'd take a Coke box, the end of a Coke 
box. You know, it's got those little 12 things in

08:28.901 --> 08:30.844
it. They'd cut a notch in it like that. And they'd 
come in and throw a bucket of water in your bed and

08:33.968 --> 08:38.134
then shut your door. And they'd hook that over the 
doorknob, and you couldn't open your door. So all

08:41.587 --> 08:46.383
the time, the upperclassmen were having the 
freshmen go down, drown out some children. And of

08:47.467 --> 08:50.938
course we got caught, we got in trouble, but the 
upperclassmen, They're the ones doing it. We did

08:52.475 --> 08:53.697
whatever they said.

08:56.421 --> 08:59.626
Grabbed boots for us all the time, stuff like that. 
We could not stay on our beds at all in the daytime.

09:02.290 --> 09:04.133
We couldn't sit on our beds. Cesar Blue would let me 
come over to his room. He was senior and an officer.

09:08.360 --> 09:10.463
He'd let me take a nap on his bed sometimes. But you 
couldn't sit on your bed. If the upperclassmen

09:13.368 --> 09:19.137
came in, of course, you had to jump to a kitchen, 
stuff like that. We just lived in horror all the

09:20.247 --> 09:22.050
time. But it became a game. All right, now, what 
outfit were you in? I was in A infantry. And that was

09:31.104 --> 09:33.087
not an... No, I'm sorry. First year was F infantry. 
And that was not an athletic outfit? It was an

09:36.913 --> 09:38.436
athletic outfit. Oh, it was? Yeah, when I was a 
freshman. Did y'all have a nickname that's

09:40.579 --> 09:43.183
tellable in mixed company? No, they didn't do that 
in those days. Oh, really? I don't remember any of

09:44.866 --> 09:46.288
them being like that. When I was a sophomore, we 
lived with our outfields. We were just not all

09:53.179 --> 09:54.540
military. But like they do now, they have these 
nicknames. I don't know. Today,

10:00.105 --> 10:08.093
there may be A through B infantry. We had A through M 
infantry. That's all there is in the Army. Three

10:12.957 --> 10:14.459
regiments. We had A through M field artillery. We 
had coastal artillery, we had the jocks, we had

10:17.986 --> 10:25.421
ordnance, and maybe one other. We didn't have an 
air force in those days. Was there any of those Army

10:30.071 --> 10:38.247
specialties that had a higher prestige? I don't 
think so. I'll tell you the meanest bunch of the

10:40.274 --> 10:43.678
whole damn place was the band. The band? Oh, yeah. 
They'd fight and drop a hat. Is that right? They'd

10:47.001 --> 10:48.062
go by. I think a band lived over in Walton, I mean, 
Longford. And Josh would go by there and make some

10:54.108 --> 10:57.952
derogatory of the band. That's all that. The band 
was tough. All right, now, normally you were up at

11:00.675 --> 11:03.458
what island? daylight i guess i'll get six o'clock 
six o'clock probably and then uh breakfast and so

11:03.708 --> 11:26.070
you're in classes pretty well all morning yes all 
right then uh this is during football season yeah

11:03.708 --> 11:26.070
then noon meal then what what time did what did you 
do between lunch and football practice But we went

11:26.590 --> 11:30.336
to classes in the afternoon until about 3 o'clock. 
Now, Stalin's did something different. Then you

11:32.340 --> 11:35.966
went straight to practice. Then after practice, 
we'd go over to Francis Hall on the campus and have

11:35.986 --> 11:46.184
what we called a youth college school practice. 
Coach Norton would come in and... and we'd have

11:48.967 --> 11:52.771
about an hour of talking about what's going on. 
They don't do that more, they do it now before, but

11:52.791 --> 11:56.715
we'd do it at night over there. And so we got home 
around eight o'clock, 8.30, best I can recall. And

12:04.143 --> 12:08.929
then typically did y'all really do homework in 
your room? Yeah, they had compulsory study, not as

12:09.069 --> 12:17.758
probably strict as they all do now, but from like 
seven to nine, There was no monkey business going

12:18.042 --> 12:20.525
on, or seven to 10. Nobody, no, that didn't bother 
me. Now, was it according to the rules for you to be

12:23.910 --> 12:30.879
out of your room after 10 o'clock? We didn't get out 
after 10 o'clock. So when you all slipped out of the

12:34.003 --> 12:36.786
dormitory, that was rare? I never slipped out. Had 
nowhere to go, had no way to go. There was no cars,

12:40.251 --> 12:41.132
see? Okay. But you also, you had to wear your 
uniform until you got 50 miles off campus. Mm-hmm.

12:46.105 --> 12:47.307
So we had nowhere to go. I don't even remember going 
to a home. I don't remember going past George Bush

12:49.450 --> 12:52.555
South. I don't remember going to Northgate. We 
just lived over in the little old bitty world of our

12:54.218 --> 12:56.181
own. All right. That first year you came in 
September. When did you go home? I went home

13:01.649 --> 13:03.412
Christmas. You didn't go home Thanksgiving? No. 
We played ball on Thanksgiving. Now the second

13:09.862 --> 13:12.927
year I went home Thanksgiving because we played in 
Texas. Yeah. So you went home Christmas. The war is

13:15.035 --> 13:16.557
then underway. Yeah. You come back. And

13:20.241 --> 13:24.506
you're majoring in what? Aggie. What? I'm glad you 
asked that question. My friend, Darius Moser,

13:29.452 --> 13:31.494
again. I came here. In those days, we had no 
counselors at all. I came from a good school. I did

13:37.141 --> 13:39.423
what I wanted to in high school. Big shots and all 
that junk. So I told Darish, they didn't have PE,

13:41.506 --> 13:45.149
that's what I said. I said, Darish, I ain't very 
smart, and I can't afford to bust out of here. I'd be

13:48.272 --> 13:49.313
embarrassed to death. He said, hell, take Ag Eco. 
Nobody would bust out of Ag Eco. In those days, the

13:55.458 --> 13:59.322
only job at Ag Eco was county agents. I didn't know a 
thing from a cucumber.

14:06.548 --> 14:10.872
Was there a major that a whole bunch of athletes 
took? Well, some of them took, we had some

14:11.071 --> 14:22.259
engineering, we had some under two-bit medicine, 
but most of them were under agriculture, ag-eco,

14:11.071 --> 14:22.259
most of them. Was there anybody on the football 
team then when you got here who was a notable brain?

14:28.132 --> 14:30.054
Percy Anderson. Jennings Anderson from Burnley, 
Texas. You know that? He was very smart. He was

14:35.340 --> 14:37.423
probably the smartest guy in our class. And my 
roommate was a smart old boy, Vernon Bell. We had

14:40.446 --> 14:41.868
some smart guys, yeah. But I wasn't one of them. 
Let's see. Who were some of the, as you look back on

14:46.893 --> 14:54.342
your years, who were some of the memorable 
teachers, advisors, counselors? Well, Dr. Dan

14:54.423 --> 14:56.045
Russell was. He was their bachelor. He loved 
athletes.

15:01.073 --> 15:02.235
Gosh, what's his name? I had it just on the tip of my 
tongue, who later became vice chancellor. Odie

15:08.904 --> 15:09.906
Butler. Odie, okay. Yeah, he was teaching. I think 
he just started. He taught us over there. Ray

15:14.432 --> 15:15.774
Putnam, do you remember Ray? He was one of our 
teachers over there. Screaming Al Ness was one of

15:17.737 --> 15:19.520
our teachers. And some of the others I don't 
remember too well. All right. Was there anybody

15:23.650 --> 15:28.856
you went to for advice about grade courses or 
anything else? No. They didn't tell us to. Did you

15:33.621 --> 15:36.404
go to the YMCA activities? No. On Saturday night, 
what did you and your buddies do for fun? We'd go to

15:42.171 --> 15:44.773
the free picture show up at Sammy Hall. That was it. 
That's the only place we had to go. They had a campus

15:48.117 --> 15:49.759
theater. And we go in there, well, freshman had to 
sit over inside where the upperclassmen were

15:49.790 --> 15:54.195
sitting. I was scared to go there in the first 
place. They had Franklins out on 61, but we had no

15:56.177 --> 16:00.763
way to get out. I went there one time. We didn't go 
anywhere. We'd stick our head out the thing. We got

16:04.126 --> 16:04.947
the screaming. Now, was this county dry? Yes, it 
was dry. Totally dry for beer? Yes. They had that

16:14.078 --> 16:15.499
place out up the bridge. You went to Whiskey 
Bridge. Yeah, Whiskey Bridge. All right. Uh, so,

16:18.072 --> 16:22.337
uh, Hardlickers wasn't there yet. Yes, 
Hardlickers was there. Okay. But I didn't ever go

16:23.899 --> 16:25.080
to Hardlickers. Right. Uh, now, he sold beer, 
didn't he? I don't know. Well, on Thursdays we

16:30.586 --> 16:32.849
drilled. Okay. Everybody drilled. Mm-hmm. And we 
wore a white coverall, see, with that seal on the

16:35.371 --> 16:38.795
back. I like to use them for labs, too. I wish I had 
some. And we'd march down Wellborn to

16:41.596 --> 16:45.399
Hardlickers, and then we'd cut right and go 
through the woods. Most of it was just walking

16:45.580 --> 16:47.181
through. Now, where was Hardlickers? About where 
that Coffee Bridge store is? About where that

16:51.485 --> 16:55.649
Chinese store is. I mean, that hamburger place in 
the Coffee Bridge going down the Wellborn Road?

17:02.395 --> 17:08.560
Well, best I remember, you know where the south 
side apartments are over where the poor folks

17:02.395 --> 17:08.560
live? Yeah. I think it was right there. right in 
that area. I only went in at one time. The thing I

17:13.852 --> 17:20.238
remember, they had these huge tables that 
everybody from year one had cut the initials into.

17:20.378 --> 17:28.446
Was there any place you heard of anywhere else in 
town where legally or illegally people could buy

17:20.378 --> 17:28.446
liquor? I didn't drink and I wasn't interested. 
And there was no red light area that I've ever heard

17:32.109 --> 17:34.572
of? No. They talk about these kids going down here 
to to the chicken ranch? Yeah, but I didn't know

17:39.403 --> 17:41.586
that was there. I didn't hear about that until 
after chicken ranch was no more. I don't even know

17:43.909 --> 17:45.151
how true that is. But we did have drinking. Now, the 
guy said beer in the dorms, I guarantee you. Okay.

17:50.118 --> 17:52.642
But I don't know where they got it. But it was 
serious if they got caught, was it? Well, I guess. I

17:56.648 --> 17:58.190
don't know. They said you don't drink, but, you 
know, I don't know. I never had it come up. Did y'all

18:06.646 --> 18:08.789
and youth athletes as freshmen. Y'all didn't have 
to fall out before supper. In March Inn? In March

18:13.777 --> 18:14.338
Inn. Yes, we did. We did? We did our thing in the 
core. See, we were right there in the core. You

18:17.563 --> 18:18.865
couldn't tell us and anybody else. No, but I 
thought that y'all would have been practicing

18:18.885 --> 18:21.670
still. Oh, I see what you're talking about. After 
football season, we did. Yeah. No, we came in after

18:25.496 --> 18:27.419
they'd already eaten. Yeah, we got in there late. 
Okay. All right, then once the season's over,

18:29.647 --> 18:37.057
y'all are doing exactly everything everybody 
else is doing. Among your freshman recruit

18:37.297 --> 18:43.425
colleagues, did many of them drop out of school? 
Yes, quite a few. One of the biggest

18:47.170 --> 18:52.077
disappointments I had, when they started 
breaking teams down as freshmen, I think they had,

18:52.495 --> 19:00.723
I said 100, I know there's over 100 guys, and I think 
they broke down about 10 teams, and I still hadn't

18:52.495 --> 19:00.723
been picked. Well, I was just really upset. I was 
scared because I didn't want to have to leave here.

19:05.047 --> 19:09.411
So I know that later on it turned out a lot of the guys 
left, and that was early and all. But, yeah, we had

19:10.012 --> 19:11.694
guys leaving every day. Every day people left. 
Now, the varsity then had about how many on

19:13.215 --> 19:16.859
scholarship? Oh, gosh. Let me look here. I've got a 
picture of it. 40, 50? Let's look.

19:25.081 --> 19:27.084
They have about 100. So about 50. By and large, as 
far as you know, we're almost all of them on full

19:29.887 --> 19:34.173
scholarship. As far as I know. You know why they 
only need 50? Oh, everybody played one way. Both

19:39.560 --> 19:39.940
ways. They played both ways. And you freshmen, 
about how many were on scholarship? Do you know? I

19:44.626 --> 19:46.388
have no idea. Now, was it a secret when you were a 
student? Did... Did folks like you, were you

19:52.520 --> 19:55.705
hesitant to say, oh, I'm in scholarship? No, it was 
no secret. I just don't know. I figured everybody

19:57.388 --> 20:00.353
was. But some of them might be partial. I don't 
really know. No, it was no secret. It was public

20:05.501 --> 20:07.865
knowledge. And you took, what kind of academic 
level did you take that first year? I don't know,

20:12.922 --> 20:17.828
but I would guess around 12, 14, somewhere 15. Took 
a basic course. Were there any that you remember

20:20.191 --> 20:25.798
that first year that were either unusually easy or 
unusually hard? Algebra was unusually hard. I had

20:28.061 --> 20:30.404
to take it twice. Okay. Very hard. And what did you 
wear to class? I wore a uniform. I didn't even have

20:36.511 --> 20:37.833
to be in clothes then. And what was your attitude 
about class attendance? I didn't cut class, I was

20:41.761 --> 20:44.164
afraid to. Now here's what I did do, as you may or may 
not know, they had this auditorium and they

20:44.745 --> 20:53.196
checked roll by the inter-seat number, you know, I 
guess I still stand. The last time, Mosier sent me

20:53.216 --> 20:55.379
to sit up in his seat. He didn't come in the 
instructor, he just, he wasn't even paying

20:55.540 --> 21:00.526
attention to what it was, the seat was covered, so 
Mosier got credit for it. I did that a lot. Okay. And

21:02.689 --> 21:04.211
he was a senior? He was a senior, big dog. He's a big 
dog. Okay. But you couldn't send anybody to sit in

21:07.445 --> 21:11.770
your seat. I didn't cut class. I don't think I ever 
cut class. All right. As you look back on your

21:14.694 --> 21:21.502
courses, which courses do you remember most 
fondly that you enjoyed? Speech. Speech. I loved

21:25.206 --> 21:25.687
it. Who was Dr. Doak? And public speaking 
particularly. I took that course, and I just loved

21:28.690 --> 21:30.853
it. But that got me, oh, I was nervous. I mean, a 
little scared kid. And they made us get, the

21:35.763 --> 21:40.507
greatest thing about coming to A&M to me has two 
things. They made you introduce yourself. And you

21:42.649 --> 21:43.810
still do it today. You just automatically, 
nothing here takes me more than to talk to somebody

21:44.211 --> 21:48.374
and they don't tell me who it is. They made you speak 
to everybody. And they made you, and we were not

21:51.157 --> 21:54.720
like that when we came here. We were scared. And we 
were ignorant of that. And that thing, that

21:57.403 --> 22:00.165
personality just came out more like that. Because 
you were an oddball if you didn't, and you're going

22:00.533 --> 22:04.319
to get in all kinds of trouble if you didn't. So you 
had to learn that. They don't have it today. Did you

22:07.443 --> 22:08.365
ever hitchhike? All the time. And where, if you're 
going to go home to Stephenville, where did you

22:10.047 --> 22:14.794
catch a ride from? Eastgate. You know that story 
about lining up. I understand that grades and

22:18.860 --> 22:25.410
class rank, none of those matter. Who got there 
first. Who got there first. And if you were coming

22:27.302 --> 22:33.628
at 50th in line, you could put your suitcase down, 
go pick you up, come back, and they would move it up.

22:33.648 --> 22:36.190
And that you always were in uniform. Always. Never 
assigned. No. Tell them where you were going. No.

22:42.296 --> 22:46.360
So normally it would take you about how long to get 
from here to Steubenville? Well, one time I left

22:46.381 --> 22:48.723
here in the afternoon. I got there the next morning 
at 6 o'clock. I got hung up in Clifton, Texas. What

22:54.251 --> 22:55.693
route would you normally take? Well, I used to, I'd 
go from here to Waco. And Waco, I'd go up to Clifton,

22:58.537 --> 23:03.724
Valley Mills, Iredale, Ico. But there was no 
traffic through. I found out later it's quicker if

23:04.966 --> 23:07.449
I go from here to Fort Worth. And then go out from 
Fort Worth. And I'd go that way. Did you ever have

23:12.156 --> 23:14.319
any negative experience? Never. Never? People 
looked for you. We had stations that they'd go look

23:16.822 --> 23:19.005
for you. And, of course, the uniform was unusual in 
those days, and anybody in uniform was an Aggie, so

23:19.542 --> 23:26.752
everybody knew who the Aggies were. And do you have 
any fond experiences? Well, I have one that

23:31.519 --> 23:33.221
happened one time. I was hitchhiking in 
Stephenville, and I got hung up in Clifton, Texas,

23:33.702 --> 23:39.269
early in the afternoon. And I remember I was 
standing on the corner there, and this little old

23:39.710 --> 23:47.000
lady came by me and saw me, and she went on downtown. 
You've been to Clifton, haven't you? And she came

23:48.972 --> 23:51.695
back six o'clock and I was still standing there. 
And she stopped and said, honey, why don't you come

23:52.556 --> 23:55.879
home and suffer with me? She thought I finally got a 
ride and a pickup. And he took me to Glen Rose, which

24:00.344 --> 24:02.607
is out of the way. And I spent most of the night 
there. And that's when I got home at six o'clock the

24:04.649 --> 24:06.671
next morning. It took about 13 hours or something. 
But yeah, we moved pretty fast. And you and your

24:10.996 --> 24:14.399
buddies never worried about your safety? Never 
thought about it. That's what I heard. We had to

24:17.603 --> 24:18.844
talk. Our rules were you talk to your host if they 
want to talk. If they don't talk, you don't talk,

24:23.233 --> 24:27.862
and you do not go to sleep. And that was S.O.T. And I 
understand that sometimes the car would stop and

24:30.607 --> 24:37.440
take only one person. And other times, they'd take 
as many people as they had seats. We had trucks. We

24:42.334 --> 24:44.056
had flatbed trucks load them up. I've seen 40 guys 
get on one truck. Oh, my. Now, that wiped the line

24:46.478 --> 24:47.699
out. Oh, my. That was what was really great. Now, 
was Eastgate the starting point both for going

24:50.242 --> 24:54.666
north and south? That's right. You didn't 
upstream, you know. Yeah, yeah. You went out there

24:57.749 --> 25:00.191
if you're going to hitchhike. Yeah. Okay. Now, 
there must have been a special place, say, in Fort

25:01.132 --> 25:05.316
Worth. There was, and it was in Waco. Okay. And 
there was one in Abilene. There was all over the

25:09.555 --> 25:11.098
state of Texas. One in Austin, one in Houston. And 
I've never heard of anybody in any of those other

25:13.521 --> 25:21.213
towns trying to play any pranks on the hitchhiker. 
I never had any pranks. It was just something that

25:22.755 --> 25:25.900
everybody talked about. The people loved the 
Aggies. They took a little poor little lonesome

25:27.402 --> 25:30.366
boy down there by himself. I'd go home, and my 
mother and her old friends, they'd tell so sorry

25:30.787 --> 25:35.234
about you. You know how scroungy some of us were. 
Now, were there midnight y'all practices that

25:36.955 --> 25:40.001
freshman year? Yes, yes. All right, and did you 
have any dates to those? No. So you went by

25:46.253 --> 25:47.796
yourself. Went to Houston. I remember Houston, we 
went down there when I was a freshman to play Rice,

25:48.938 --> 25:55.590
and they had it at the Rice Hotel. Oh, my God. And the 
L leaders were on top of the canopy and they called

25:56.547 --> 26:04.275
the fire department out and broke it up and they 
dispersed the whole crowd with the fire hose. Oh

26:04.295 --> 26:04.876
boy. I've been in that one. Alright, was that a 
court trip? That's a court trip. Okay. And did you,

26:11.502 --> 26:15.146
freshman athletes, did you all march? No, not a 
court trip. Okay, no. Did the Tessies come down

26:20.251 --> 26:21.913
here? Yeah, but I never saw any of them. Now, I 
remember when I was a sophomore, see, I was nearly

26:24.064 --> 26:32.431
married to my first wife. And as a sophomore, we 
lived over in 12, and I remember that 10 was emptied

26:32.451 --> 26:45.283
out, and these girls came in there for a dance, you 
know, where they'd put the curtains up and all. But

26:45.303 --> 26:46.084
I don't remember. I never heard the testes when I 
was here. But I was already taken. Yeah. All right,

26:49.906 --> 26:52.829
that freshman year, do you remember muster? No.

26:58.034 --> 26:58.415
Let's see. Oh, did you and your buddies ever turn on 
the radio to listen to President Roosevelt's

26:58.435 --> 27:04.321
speeches? Yes, some. Particularly that Monday 
speech. Yeah, yeah. Did you listen to that one?

27:12.789 --> 27:14.191
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Infamous. Yeah, where were you? 
I was up in the dorm. In the dorm? Okay. The thing

27:18.712 --> 27:25.840
that impressed me about President Roosevelt, I 
couldn't understand how a man could talk and never

27:18.712 --> 27:25.840
say uh or oh. I didn't realize he was reading those 
speeches. I thought he was fantastic. Oh, no, no

27:31.587 --> 27:33.849
more from me. Thank you. No. A glass of water. No, 
I'm doing mine. As a country kid, see, I was born in

27:38.515 --> 27:44.061
31. He was the first person I ever heard on the radio 
do formal things. So I thought he sounded so

27:51.494 --> 27:54.939
polished, so articulate. Oh, yeah, I couldn't 
understand anything. So skillful. Yeah. Let's

27:59.266 --> 27:59.707
see. During that freshman year, what were the 
highest prestige student? Band commander, corps

28:08.661 --> 28:10.985
commander, what? Corps commander, definitely. 
Corps commander. In those days, most guys, as you

28:14.293 --> 28:19.880
know, you know all this, worked away through 
school. Our battalion commander was also a yell

28:20.120 --> 28:30.032
leader, but he also worked in the kitchen as a 
kitchen employee, working his way through. Did

28:30.052 --> 28:39.924
you ever hear a guy, Buck, did you ever hear an old 
boy named Buck come over here? Where Joe Hedrick

28:39.944 --> 28:40.845
lives. Franklin, this guy's name was Buck. He 
played football here. He's the one that beat up the

28:46.437 --> 28:48.079
Corps of Commanders. What's his first name? I 
don't know. Well, I won't get into it. Anyway, he's

28:52.444 --> 28:53.465
dead now. All right. At the end of that freshman 
year, what did you do that summer? I went to work

29:01.913 --> 29:04.576
with Burt Pop. New London, Texas. Doing what? 
Rough making in the oil field. What'd you make? 75

29:10.062 --> 29:10.242
cents. Was that good pay? That was good if you're 
going to make that kind of work. We had some guys

29:13.499 --> 29:19.314
that made a little bit more of that, but they worked 
on tanks, building those huge tanks, and I wasn't

29:13.499 --> 29:19.314
strong enough to handle those. And you were there 
at New London near the site of that explosion?

29:24.008 --> 29:27.132
Yeah, we had a camp right nearby. And then you're 
back in the fall of 42. And

29:31.817 --> 29:38.185
it's getting hairier and hairier. And let's see, 
the Kitty Corps was not next year. That was next

29:42.129 --> 29:43.351
year. All right, so that by and large, your 
sophomore year, you play, what position did you

29:43.371 --> 29:50.059
play? You were running back for first team, second 
team? Well, I alternated on first team. With? Leo

29:57.590 --> 29:59.873
Daniels and Brian Taylor. Now, we played, I played 
safety on the second, on the defense. And did y'all

30:04.737 --> 30:08.861
make any notable trips that year? We went to 
Oklahoma. We went to Carpus. We played Carpus

30:12.925 --> 30:16.368
Naval Station at Doe Rollins. Doe Rollins was 
coaching. They beat the car out of us. All these old

30:20.071 --> 30:21.773
college kids. Yeah. and we went to LSU. That's the 
first time I'd ever eaten on a train. Now, y'all

30:29.235 --> 30:31.257
picked up the train here? We picked the train up 
here, and we drove it, rode it to Houston, and then

30:31.477 --> 30:38.625
we got off, got on sleep, and went to Baton Rouge. 
Yeah, went to Baton Rouge. We spent the night and

30:40.247 --> 30:47.555
got up early and came back to Houston and then 
switched to the train that comes through here

30:40.247 --> 30:47.555
regularly and came on back home. That was usually 
the routine. Now, how many times had you been on the

30:49.437 --> 30:52.200
train before this? Well, I was in the National 
Guard when I was 14, so I'd go wherever somebody

30:52.703 --> 30:56.588
came. But it was not a fancy train like that. When we 
played Oklahoma, we'd ride the train up there.

31:03.296 --> 31:06.400
When we played Arkansas, we'd ride the train up to 
Muskogee. We'd get off and then bus in because you

31:06.921 --> 31:10.626
couldn't get to the train. How was being a 
sophomore different from being a freshman? Oh, we

31:16.052 --> 31:17.134
thought we were big shots. And we felt it. And we got 
out all the hell that we had to go through as

31:19.296 --> 31:22.120
freshmen. Did you have room orderly? No. Oh, so 
sophomore didn't get that? No, I didn't. I never

31:28.686 --> 31:29.627
had anybody. I didn't like, I tried to hurt 
somebody, but I didn't have room orderly, no. I

31:34.572 --> 31:35.232
didn't want one. That year you lived where? I lived 
in dorm 12. I'm 11. Same outfit? Same outfit. Same

31:41.038 --> 31:41.799
outfit. And the total enrollment at A&M? I'm 
guessing five, maybe. I don't know. It could be

31:49.186 --> 31:49.807
more. Did it go down?
