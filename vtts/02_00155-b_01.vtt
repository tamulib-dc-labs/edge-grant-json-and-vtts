00:03.895 --> 00:12.968
This one particular place in Fort Worth, one of the brothers had a fairly good looking daughter.

00:13.669 --> 00:15.592
She was a little bit younger.

00:15.612 --> 00:17.194
But I had a date with her.

00:17.214 --> 00:25.285
I imagine most all the time they had dances after the football game.

00:25.305 --> 00:31.354
And I believe that I took her to a dance.

00:34.473 --> 00:34.933
Let's see.

00:35.034 --> 00:37.996
Now, did you by chance meet Betty during any of these years?

00:38.016 --> 00:38.177
No.

00:38.197 --> 00:51.289
Okay, so that... I did not meet Betty until I had graduated and was working in Alvin just before I was going to Oklahoma University.

00:51.309 --> 01:00.117
Okay, so that... Let's see, we talked about where women stayed.

01:02.480 --> 01:02.860
Let's see.

01:02.992 --> 01:06.957
Describe for me North Gate, South Gate.

01:07.257 --> 01:08.819
What was just off campus?

01:09.820 --> 01:13.365
I'd say probably you only had two gates.

01:13.485 --> 01:16.869
North Gate, that was going toward Bryan.

01:17.670 --> 01:21.214
And then Main Gate, do you recall it then?

01:21.374 --> 01:23.116
That was West Gate.

01:23.737 --> 01:32.728
That was if you were going to go on the train or go across tracks to the most kind of the activity.

01:34.177 --> 01:36.140
I've seen that one time.

01:36.160 --> 01:40.927
One time I know that that highway was finished.

01:41.768 --> 01:42.609
It's number six now.

01:44.832 --> 01:45.934
Was that during your time?

01:46.635 --> 01:50.180
I believe so, because I think I remember hitchhiking.

01:50.200 --> 01:50.440
Right.

01:50.460 --> 01:55.487
At Northgate, what businesses and places of entertainment were at the Northgate?

01:56.709 --> 02:00.434
Oh, there weren't too many there compared to now.

02:02.157 --> 02:03.238
They had a bookstore.

02:03.877 --> 02:07.721
and something like a drug store, maybe.

02:07.741 --> 02:09.042
Was Lupo yet in business?

02:12.405 --> 02:18.451
I think that he developed all that later, I believe.

02:18.471 --> 02:19.592
Let's see, did you have a car?

02:20.253 --> 02:22.114
No.

02:22.515 --> 02:26.979
A friend had a car in my senior year.

02:27.299 --> 02:30.382
Did a buddy ever lend his car to another?

02:31.403 --> 02:33.225
No.

02:34.049 --> 02:40.357
I borrowed a car when we, say, went to Houston on a core trip.

02:40.377 --> 02:46.244
I had a brother-in-law and a sister, and they had a car, and they loaned it to me.

02:46.264 --> 02:47.665
Where did the faculty live?

02:49.608 --> 02:57.697
As far as I know, most of them lived just to the east of the highway, in the older part of College Station.

02:57.717 --> 03:00.360
Were there some faculty residences still on campus?

03:02.183 --> 03:02.583
Yes.

03:02.603 --> 03:03.364
Oh, definitely, yes.

03:03.547 --> 03:17.845
Yeah, I remember this fellow that was head of the veterinary department, lived there.

03:17.865 --> 03:18.466
What was his name, the doctor?

03:18.486 --> 03:18.886
The most famous one.

03:18.906 --> 03:19.768
Started with the veterinary school.

03:19.788 --> 03:21.570
Yeah, there were several of them.

03:21.590 --> 03:24.754
Were you all ever invited into their homes?

03:27.978 --> 03:31.242
Well, I was invited into Harold Vance's home because

03:31.475 --> 03:36.020
This girl from Houston stayed there, and that's the only time.

03:36.040 --> 03:36.801
This was a date?

03:37.482 --> 03:39.704
A date from Houston, they stayed with me.

03:40.265 --> 03:44.449
Alright, now, did you pay them rent or anything?

03:44.469 --> 03:44.590
No.

03:45.150 --> 03:45.671
They did that?

03:45.951 --> 03:46.792
They would.

03:46.992 --> 03:51.117
They'd be insulted if you asked a thing.

03:51.137 --> 03:55.121
I mean, they didn't charge, as far as I know, when they stayed in the dorms.

03:56.343 --> 04:01.228
Now, you got there in 30,

04:01.833 --> 04:03.154
Fall of 34.

04:03.775 --> 04:05.737
And left in the spring of 38.

04:05.757 --> 04:07.358
Is that right?

04:08.979 --> 04:09.120
No.

04:09.140 --> 04:11.602
Let's see.

04:11.862 --> 04:13.784
I should have graduated in the fall of 38.

04:13.804 --> 04:14.504
38.

04:14.725 --> 04:15.625
Okay.

04:15.645 --> 04:22.171
And then I went to the first term of summer school.

04:22.191 --> 04:22.291
Okay.

04:22.311 --> 04:22.512
All right.

04:22.732 --> 04:29.298
What national or international events do you remember during that time?

04:30.118 --> 04:31.840
The most...

04:34.553 --> 04:39.839
What's surprising, I guess, was Larson Wells' deal.

04:39.859 --> 04:41.341
Ooh, describe that.

04:41.701 --> 04:54.597
Well, I was living off campus, and that happened, apparently, in the first part of 39, if I'm not mistaken.

04:55.377 --> 04:57.880
And it's amazing.

04:58.661 --> 05:01.164
Someone had their radio on.

05:01.184 --> 05:04.408
This house we're staying in,

05:05.418 --> 05:06.820
It was just all students.

05:07.100 --> 05:12.567
There were no godmother or anything else.

05:12.587 --> 05:18.835
There was only about four, maybe six boys at the most probably staying there.

05:18.895 --> 05:27.545
And someone had a radio on, and they all got together and wondered what's going to happen.

05:27.565 --> 05:31.290
Actually, a friend of mine had a car.

05:32.063 --> 05:38.192
And we said the best thing we better do is get down to Alabama and see what's going on.

05:38.212 --> 05:46.243
And I said what we should do is bring our folks there because we had a little bit of Army training.

05:46.263 --> 05:47.525
Isn't that something?

05:47.545 --> 05:50.268
And then it all blew up when it stopped.

05:50.288 --> 05:52.411
But that's really something.

05:52.431 --> 05:53.813
And you heard the broadcast?

05:53.893 --> 05:55.235
Oh yes, definitely.

05:55.255 --> 06:00.062
And actually we kind of talked about going and I actually thought that the

06:00.498 --> 06:06.865
The best thing we were really surprised was to try to bring our folks to the college station.

06:07.806 --> 06:09.668
Did you all stop what you were doing to listen?

06:10.329 --> 06:14.793
Well, it was at night, and sure we stopped.

06:14.813 --> 06:18.077
We were starting to leave.

06:18.097 --> 06:23.443
Any other national or worldwide events?

06:27.507 --> 06:30.370
Were there any events in Europe that got your attention?

06:31.328 --> 06:35.373
Well, you know, Hitler invaded the sea.

06:36.855 --> 06:39.778
He invaded Poland after I graduated.

06:39.798 --> 06:40.899
That's September 139.

06:40.919 --> 06:42.822
Yes, that's correct.

06:43.783 --> 06:46.466
One of my best friends was from Poland.

06:46.486 --> 06:47.547
I got acquainted with him.

06:49.149 --> 06:53.795
He had come from Poland even though he was a naturalized citizen.

06:53.815 --> 06:57.619
I was born in Chicago.

06:57.639 --> 07:00.002
He was planning to go back over there.

07:01.552 --> 07:07.921
And I had considered the possibility of maybe going over there to visit him or something.

07:07.941 --> 07:10.465
But he went on over and I was going to come later.

07:10.485 --> 07:12.408
But he got caught in that deal.

07:13.510 --> 07:20.320
But he got out, luckily, and joined the Army here and did real work.

07:20.340 --> 07:28.572
When you were having drill instruction and training and all in the Corps, did you and your...

07:29.125 --> 07:33.350
fellow students think that it might lead you all into wartime?

07:33.871 --> 07:42.041
No, I have no idea and I really felt that I wasn't prepared to be an officer really.

07:42.061 --> 07:53.536
Of course they gave all of them training and the best training you got, I guess, was at the camp between junior and senior year.

07:54.697 --> 07:56.820
We went to Fort Lowe.

07:58.724 --> 08:07.617
you have more responsibility really to lead troops even though we didn't take it very seriously.

08:08.037 --> 08:15.968
We didn't think that when we were drilling the freshman or something like that or marching around or even target.

08:15.989 --> 08:24.420
See, we never did have rifles until we went to camps, summer camps.

08:24.801 --> 08:26.564
All right, you went to summer camp at Logan?

08:26.844 --> 08:27.405
Fort Logan.

08:27.605 --> 08:28.326
And where else?

08:28.829 --> 08:29.310
That's all.

08:29.330 --> 08:34.275
Oh, that was the... Well, see, I did go to Bullis, Camp Bullis one time.

08:34.435 --> 08:34.816
Oh.

08:34.836 --> 08:37.699
That's after.

08:38.880 --> 08:43.406
And when were you commissioned?

08:43.426 --> 08:50.434
If I'm not mistaken, I was 20, and I didn't get the commission until after.

08:51.114 --> 08:51.355
After you?

08:51.375 --> 08:52.897
When I got 21, I believe.

08:52.917 --> 08:53.357
Okay.

08:54.919 --> 08:55.459
Let's see.

08:56.020 --> 08:57.722
Then after I got the degree.

08:58.225 --> 09:03.109
Back to the radio, did you all listen to any Roosevelt speeches on the radio?

09:05.531 --> 09:07.413
I didn't.

09:07.553 --> 09:10.996
Did you all pay much attention to state or national politics?

09:12.317 --> 09:16.541
Yes, I think so.

09:16.661 --> 09:18.162
Let's see.

09:18.503 --> 09:26.089
I went to W. Leo Daniels' inauguration here in Austin.

09:26.109 --> 09:26.950
Because?

09:27.588 --> 09:28.910
Just for fun or were you?

09:30.512 --> 09:37.642
I was going with a girl and her parents wanted to go, so they came by and picked me up and came over here.

09:37.662 --> 09:43.831
And they were selling these clay biscuits, you know, please pass the biscuits.

09:43.911 --> 09:50.320
Anyhow, and then the fella drove to San Antonio.

09:50.360 --> 09:51.161
They wanted to go there.

09:51.582 --> 09:53.425
And then they drove me back to Valley Station.

09:54.366 --> 09:57.190
And then they took off for parallel.

09:57.963 --> 10:00.427
So you came to Austin for his first inauguration?

10:00.828 --> 10:03.532
Yes.

10:04.313 --> 10:07.999
Politics in Texas has always been interesting.

10:09.001 --> 10:12.626
Student indulgences, did many students use tobacco then?

10:14.529 --> 10:21.581
Well, actually, in the group I was in, I don't think too many of them smoked.

10:21.601 --> 10:24.425
And none of them chewed tobacco.

10:24.445 --> 10:25.607
And none of them used snuff.

10:26.313 --> 10:31.520
Of the students who did smoke, what was the most popular brands?

10:33.163 --> 10:38.570
I never did smoke.

10:38.931 --> 10:39.812
Cigars, no.

10:43.057 --> 10:45.921
There were some cigar smokers?

10:46.842 --> 10:49.806
Actually, at some of the banquets,

10:50.191 --> 10:55.137
At the Cebiza Hall, they actually passed out the cigars.

10:55.157 --> 10:56.018
Did you ever hear of that?

10:56.678 --> 10:59.602
Yeah, and that's when I would smoke a cigar.

11:00.543 --> 11:04.788
All right, what were the, and let's see, you said beer was pretty rare.

11:04.808 --> 11:06.209
No, no.

11:06.830 --> 11:11.295
It came into being in 1936, I believe.

11:11.315 --> 11:13.718
All right, what were the favorite varieties of beer?

11:16.077 --> 11:19.442
Some of the Texas breweries, I believe.

11:19.463 --> 11:21.947
Do you remember them?

11:21.967 --> 11:22.668
Well, let's see.

11:22.948 --> 11:31.302
There was a Grand Prize and... Southern Select.

11:31.322 --> 11:32.664
Well, it was Shiner Beer.

11:32.684 --> 11:33.846
Shiner.

11:33.866 --> 11:36.110
Yeah, I had a friend from... Pearl.

11:36.390 --> 11:38.413
San Antonio, yeah.

11:38.433 --> 11:39.435
Pearl.

11:39.455 --> 11:40.597
Jack's, Falstaff.

11:41.438 --> 11:42.540
So they were there.

11:44.123 --> 11:46.366
You do know who owned Grand Prize?

11:47.148 --> 11:47.348
No.

11:47.528 --> 11:48.510
Howard Hughes.

11:48.970 --> 11:50.653
His father had created it.

11:50.793 --> 11:51.694
Well, that's good.

11:52.055 --> 11:52.435
Let's see.

11:55.520 --> 11:57.863
Whiskey Bridge wasn't yet a reality.

11:58.565 --> 12:05.976
Didn't drive across, going to Snook and see, right when I got there in the 50s, that's where it was the nearest place to get whiskey.

12:06.096 --> 12:09.421
Was that little place at the filling station too?

12:09.681 --> 12:10.042
Mm-hmm.

12:10.062 --> 12:12.325
Yeah, I've been there.

12:12.760 --> 12:17.165
Let's see, we talked about a court trip and football, final review, commencement.

12:18.186 --> 12:20.068
Did you all hold silver taps in those days?

12:20.088 --> 12:20.248
Oh, yes.

12:20.909 --> 12:21.830
Describe it, please.

12:22.050 --> 12:26.856
Well, they did it on a kind of an individual deal.

12:26.876 --> 12:29.158
And it wasn't as frequent, of course, now.

12:29.979 --> 12:31.321
I mean, as now.

12:32.482 --> 12:38.749
And ordinarily, they'd announce it, say, the day or the day before.

12:38.769 --> 12:42.413
And everybody would go down at the...

12:43.355 --> 12:49.040
The buglers were up on top of the old administration.

12:49.341 --> 12:51.242
And what time of day or night was it?

12:51.282 --> 12:51.783
It was midnight.

12:53.204 --> 12:56.748
And how did y'all conduct yourselves?

12:56.848 --> 12:58.749
We went there, got it over and went back.

12:58.770 --> 13:02.093
But did you snicker and goof off?

13:02.113 --> 13:02.173
No.

13:02.193 --> 13:03.114
It was taken seriously?

13:03.134 --> 13:03.314
Yes.

13:04.815 --> 13:06.577
What did y'all do when it was over?

13:07.858 --> 13:12.062
Went back to go to bed.

13:13.072 --> 13:16.195
Let's see, muster.

13:17.157 --> 13:19.379
Was muster held in those days?

13:21.041 --> 13:23.844
And if so, where?

13:23.864 --> 13:27.568
I don't remember the first muster.

13:27.588 --> 13:29.430
I don't believe that they had one on the campus.

13:36.799 --> 13:39.562
I really don't remember when they started.

13:39.582 --> 13:40.783
OK, so the key truth.

13:41.033 --> 13:45.898
What were then the key traditional Aggie events in a year?

13:57.729 --> 14:04.795
When you were getting ready to leave as a student, what kind of world did you think you were going to be entering?

14:05.356 --> 14:06.517
I didn't have any idea.

14:08.178 --> 14:09.960
No, I was real lucky.

14:10.312 --> 14:15.921
I was able to work in the oil fields two summers before I graduated.

14:15.941 --> 14:25.075
And I had a relative that was a geologist, so he helped me a whole lot.

14:26.698 --> 14:37.635
And so I was very fortunate in having, I didn't try to get a job until I finished Oklahoma University.

14:38.881 --> 14:54.402
And the reason I went to Oklahoma is that they had a better petroleum geology school, even though I got a degree in petroleum geology from Oklahoma, because it would have been more difficult to get a geology degree, but I went there just for the geology.

14:54.422 --> 14:57.346
All right, now you got an undergraduate degree at A&M.

14:57.366 --> 14:58.607
Yes, a petroleum engineering.

14:58.627 --> 14:59.168
And then?

14:59.568 --> 15:00.370
Master's degree.

15:00.390 --> 15:00.810
Master's.

15:04.255 --> 15:06.778
And tell me about getting your first job.

15:08.362 --> 15:09.383
Well, I was real lucky.

15:13.469 --> 15:17.074
Let's see.

15:17.094 --> 15:27.268
At OU, I was interviewed by Exxon, the engineer, chief engineer of Exxon.

15:27.288 --> 15:37.221
And, let's see, I had the Stanley Oil and Gas Company then worked.

15:37.606 --> 15:39.027
drilling near Alvin.

15:39.848 --> 15:43.712
And my dad do the lawyer.

15:44.372 --> 15:48.536
We had some land in the field.

15:48.557 --> 15:56.965
He worked with the lawyer and then somehow he knew the head chief engineer.

15:58.426 --> 16:05.773
But the fellow interviewed me for Exxon and I chose

16:10.478 --> 16:25.580
Actually, I went over to the Tulsa Oil Show and my cousin, husband, who's a geologist, wrote a letter of recommendation to Shell Oil, one of his friends at the Tulsa Shell office.

16:26.842 --> 16:28.465
And they offered me a job.

16:29.406 --> 16:35.575
And I had a job from, it was Hummel Oil and Gas.

16:37.259 --> 16:42.965
And I had to choose between the two and one of them off at 125 and one at 135.

16:44.486 --> 16:45.648
So you knew which one I took.

16:48.871 --> 16:54.817
As you began that job, how well prepared did you think you were for the real world?

16:55.197 --> 17:02.625
Actually, I was luckier than most kids out of college because I'd worked in the oil field and I was able to

17:03.162 --> 17:07.025
communicate or get along with the people in the field.

17:07.666 --> 17:09.587
See, I was a trainee for two years.

17:10.828 --> 17:13.951
They let you do work in different areas.

17:15.312 --> 17:32.967
I started out in a core lab and went to a persistent interpretation of electric logs in Louisiana for real good fellows, developed their own interpretation of electric logs.

17:34.027 --> 17:36.671
Worked at a gas plant.

17:36.691 --> 17:46.926
Worked on a small work over unit.

17:46.946 --> 17:49.870
I never did.

17:49.890 --> 17:55.859
Worked mostly in offices under the district engineer.

17:55.879 --> 18:02.008
I guess I was a trainee at Hobbs.

18:02.393 --> 18:05.356
And it was about two years about up.

18:05.376 --> 18:11.181
And the guy went into the Navy.

18:11.962 --> 18:12.703
I was under him.

18:13.243 --> 18:16.907
So I got, I took his work on.

18:19.289 --> 18:25.135
And I had a deferment at that time.

18:25.155 --> 18:26.116
Because I was buried and hadn't found the board.

18:26.136 --> 18:30.780
All right, one of the items I see I missed, was there an Aggie bonfire in those days?

18:32.093 --> 18:32.874
Yes.

18:32.894 --> 18:33.694
Where was it held?

18:35.356 --> 18:36.517
I think the same place.

18:36.757 --> 18:42.502
I don't think it ever remembers any different than the field where it is now, if I don't understand.

18:42.522 --> 18:44.223
No, they're having it now.

18:44.243 --> 18:45.484
Oh, yeah, they've changed it.

18:45.644 --> 18:56.854
And see, in my memory, it's been on the drill field, Duncan, and then northeast of the system building.

18:56.874 --> 19:01.898
Well, I think it was on, it wasn't on, what do you call it, the drill field?

19:02.249 --> 19:04.191
That drill field in front of the MSC.

19:04.632 --> 19:05.973
I don't believe it was ever there.

19:06.514 --> 19:07.956
Okay.

19:08.757 --> 19:10.299
They used to just bring trash.

19:10.379 --> 19:13.843
That's why I was going to... What was in it and where did y'all get it?

19:14.924 --> 19:20.591
Well, they were just organized then as now.

19:21.332 --> 19:25.657
And I suppose if you ran on something that wasn't tied down, you'd bring it.

19:25.677 --> 19:29.061
Was there any particular structure that was put on top?

19:29.522 --> 19:29.742
Yep.

19:30.076 --> 19:32.339
We always tried to find an outhouse.

19:34.002 --> 19:40.171
I never was privileged to take part of that.

19:40.372 --> 19:43.216
I was always afraid they'd have some money in it.

19:45.039 --> 19:51.128
Okay, now we're getting to the important two questions left.

19:51.569 --> 19:56.877
As you look back on your life, what has it meant to you that you went to Texas A&M?

19:59.101 --> 20:02.605
Well, I think there's a lot of other things that influence you about as much.

20:03.566 --> 20:13.979
It was, I'd say, basically, I'd say honesty and hard work is about as important as anything.

20:13.999 --> 20:21.648
But there's other factors like your family or friends, you know, or people that you even know after you get out.

20:22.950 --> 20:29.057
I've been fortunate to know, I'd say, three or four what I'd call genius people.

20:29.932 --> 20:32.956
I was lucky enough to work with it and own it.

20:32.976 --> 20:36.962
And that's all that are tied together.

20:36.982 --> 20:46.797
But I was always praised or had an advantage by being for me.

20:46.817 --> 20:51.424
Okay, so what feelings do you have in your heart now for Texas A&M?

20:52.986 --> 20:55.770
I'm just trying to keep financing some of their stuff.

20:59.007 --> 21:01.390
And why do you have that feeling?

21:02.872 --> 21:05.835
Well, it's been very enjoyable.

21:05.855 --> 21:12.904
And I've enjoyed working with the Department of Students Association and the association with the presidents.

21:14.005 --> 21:22.555
And I think that we were in a fortunate time when things went from not much to greatness.

21:22.635 --> 21:24.998
So it's been very interesting.

21:27.695 --> 21:32.379
It's been pretty much a hobby or whatever.

21:32.399 --> 21:34.641
Are you repaying part of the debt of gratitude?

21:35.802 --> 21:44.050
Sure.

21:44.070 --> 21:56.301
Well, it's just like anything that if you feel like you'd like to try to help it develop and you feel a warmth to it, so that's

21:57.428 --> 22:03.008
All of the work that he did in the association was just trying to help whatever the president was trying to do.

22:06.339 --> 22:08.788
And most of the time, that worked out real well.
