00:02.917 --> 00:15.409
Toby, if you would, could you please give me your 
full name and tell me a little bit about your

00:02.917 --> 00:15.409
background, how you came to chemical 
engineering, and how you came to Texas A&M? Right.

00:16.010 --> 00:30.004
My full name is Philip, one L, Toby, T-O-B-Y, 
Eubank, E-U-B-A-N-K. And I grew up in central

00:16.010 --> 00:30.004
Illinois, a farming community. Took a BS degree in 
chemical engineering from what was then Rose

00:30.929 --> 00:39.658
Polytechnic Institute, which is now Rose-Hulman 
in Terre Haute, Indiana. And then I went on to get a

00:40.679 --> 00:46.184
PhD at Northwestern University in Evanston, 
Illinois. And as I was finishing at Northwestern

00:48.386 --> 01:00.919
in what I believe was October of 1960, then I was 
looking for a job. Yes, I was in chemical

01:01.051 --> 01:04.055
engineering. Yes,

01:04.316 --> 01:13.409
my family were Ford dealers, both in cars and farm 
equipment. And

01:13.469 --> 01:24.665
so my father, who was the master mechanic, wanted 
me to become a mechanical engineer. So when I went

01:24.685 --> 01:30.653
to undergraduate school, I had the intention of 
becoming a mechanical engineer, but then I got

01:31.257 --> 01:35.422
very interested in chemical engineering because 
of its diversity. In fact, it seemed to cover most

01:35.442 --> 01:39.046
of mechanical engineering and a lot of other 
things. So I liked the versatility of it. And was

01:44.893 --> 01:48.778
there a pretty good aura, I guess you could say, 
surrounding chemical engineering at the time? It

01:48.798 --> 01:50.100
was sort of involved, isn't it? Yes, it was, and 
there were jobs and very well paid. And

01:53.404 --> 01:57.889
Rose only had chemical, mechanical, civil, 
electrical engineering. They only offered four

02:01.717 --> 02:03.519
degrees at that time. It was very small. I 
graduated with 70 total people that year, so very

02:05.301 --> 02:14.452
small engineering school. So this is October 
1960. Yes, and that's when I came down here on an

02:17.756 --> 02:28.348
interview trip, and I'd also interviewed at 
several other universities, and with Exxon, But I

02:29.577 --> 02:44.495
came down, and I talked to Doc Lindsay on the phone, 
and I almost didn't come because Doc was sort of

02:29.577 --> 02:44.495
abrupt, and he said, young man, are you sure you're 
really interested in this job? And what I really

02:45.536 --> 02:57.611
didn't know was the history, and that Doc had built 
up quite a good department during the late 40s and I

02:45.536 --> 02:57.611
think early 50s, and then had essentially lost the 
entire department. And so he was. really quite

02:59.058 --> 03:00.299
discouraged. And so I came down, and what really 
impressed me was that I didn't stay in a motel or

03:01.741 --> 03:10.489
hotel. I stayed at Doc's house. And his wife, 
Grace, who was really a fine lady, cooked

03:12.871 --> 03:24.302
breakfast, and we had a really nice environment 
here. I liked the fact that this was a small town.

03:28.387 --> 03:33.813
much larger than the one I grew up in, but still a 
very small, very hospitable place. And later

03:34.274 --> 03:42.043
after the interview trip, then Doc even drove me 
back all the way to Dallas airport to catch a plane

03:34.274 --> 03:42.043
back to Chicago. So anyway, I was really impressed 
by the hospitality. In fact, it was a very small

03:47.049 --> 03:52.775
department. You didn't take the job. Right. I took 
the job here because I also thought the state of

03:57.445 --> 04:03.210
Texas had a lot of, a very good future.

04:06.614 --> 04:08.375
And I thought A&M had a very good future. And it did 
turn out that was right. Did the military or

04:13.440 --> 04:17.544
whatever turn you off or on? No, it didn't. I had 
taken ROTC at Rose, where it wasn't nearly as

04:18.485 --> 04:27.013
serious as it was here at A&M, but I was used to that. 
After I came down here, I actually became a

04:27.230 --> 04:34.897
scholastic advisor to the airports and 
dormitories here at A&M. So I sort of enjoyed this

04:34.917 --> 04:37.239
atmosphere. And I was very impressed because when 
I arrived, the Aggies were something like, they'd

04:37.880 --> 04:54.195
been like 0 and 11 in football, and they still had 
very high spirits and were still very happy and

04:37.880 --> 04:54.195
yelling for the team and all that. So I was very 
impressed by that.

05:02.212 --> 05:04.255
And so you arrived here when? I actually arrived in 
the first of March of 1961,

05:04.275 --> 05:12.467
straight from Chicago. So it took a while to get 
used to this place. I had married in September of

05:16.973 --> 05:27.188
1960, and my wife had worked for IBM in Chicago. She 
was one of the first teachers of computers.

05:31.118 --> 05:34.823
digital computers.

05:34.844 --> 05:44.117
So we came down here and then she started teaching 
high school at Hearn, and

05:34.844 --> 05:44.117
we later had children.

05:49.706 --> 05:53.992
When you arrived, your offices were in the old 
geology building. That's right. The old geology

05:54.653 --> 05:57.056
building. At that time, Petroleum Engineering 
had just moved out. They had a new building, which

06:02.824 --> 06:05.647
was Doherty. But we were in there with geology and 
all the rocks. And it was quite an interesting

06:11.374 --> 06:13.817
building. We only had hot and cold running water, 
though, for the research labs. So it was quite a

06:20.926 --> 06:27.033
challenge to set up experimental equipment. And 
it was also totally un-air conditioned. as were

06:30.350 --> 06:32.493
most of the buildings at that time at A&M. And so I 
first went out and bought a Frederick air

06:34.556 --> 06:39.002
conditioner. And even though it was half of my 
monthly salary, I had decided I was not going to

06:40.324 --> 06:49.356
survive the summer without some air 
conditioning. And Doc Lindsay, although he was

06:49.376 --> 06:55.024
originally from Long Island, New York, told me I 
didn't need one, that if I just waited about two

06:56.185 --> 07:07.602
years, my blood would thin out and it wouldn't 
bother

06:56.185 --> 07:07.602
me. But I thought he was wrong. The sweat would run 
down my hands during the summer and onto the ink

07:08.864 --> 07:20.321
pen, and I found it very difficult to write, and it 
was also very difficult to really think. What

07:20.662 --> 07:24.167
about your teaching? Well, I was lucky, in a way, 
because I came in March. And I didn't have to teach

07:29.897 --> 07:33.901
anything until the next fall. But then it hit. And 
in those days, we taught three and four courses a

07:37.305 --> 07:42.590
semester. And I remember teaching as many as 15 
actual course hours, and teaching four different

07:43.251 --> 07:54.643
courses. We only had about 17 senior students, so 
there was just one section of each course, but

07:55.180 --> 08:08.939
there were really, I believe, just three or four of 
us teaching then. Yeah, there were. There was

08:09.700 --> 08:18.752
Charlie Holland, Doc Lindsay, myself, and there 
was... Don Harris was still in Ecuador. He'd been

08:18.772 --> 08:21.576
down there a couple years, but... Bill Harris 
taught, was teaching part-time, and so was Dick

08:22.315 --> 08:29.482
Davidson.

08:29.502 --> 08:37.170
And Dick had been here a number of years, but he was 
still working on his PhD degree. I think he

08:37.190 --> 08:38.452
finished that in 62. So we were pretty thin. We were 
teaching a lot of courses. So we all had to teach

08:45.799 --> 08:51.225
about four courses apiece to make all the courses.

08:59.706 --> 09:21.448
Well, of

08:59.706 --> 09:21.448
course, Doc was a well-known character, and he was

08:59.706 --> 09:21.448
probably about one of the finest men I've ever met 
as far as personality and honesty.

09:27.920 --> 09:30.403
But he was also a character of first rank. Doc had a 
walrus-like mustache, and in his younger days,

09:31.645 --> 09:41.939
he'd worked in a, I think it was a boiler factory. 
And so Doc never got over the fact that he had to

09:41.959 --> 09:46.345
shout. And even if he was right in your ear, he would 
He would shout, and in those days, well, my office

09:50.858 --> 10:02.872
was right next to Doc's in the old, well, what's now 
the geology building. And so if you left the window

10:03.312 --> 10:13.084
open, and we were all on the telephone, we didn't 
need extensions because you could hear Doc all the

10:03.312 --> 10:13.084
way out through the window. And Doc was really a 
great guy to work for. And he had a lot of really good

10:20.103 --> 10:25.511
personal skills. He had a lot of famous sayings 
like, if you have fish to fry, go do it in person. So

10:33.963 --> 10:44.318
if Doc wanted a favor from somebody over in the MSC, 
if he was carrying on a short course or something,

10:33.963 --> 10:44.318
he would go over and ask them personally. And he was 
well known all across the campus.

10:49.752 --> 11:15.456
it was very difficult to say no to doc lindsay 
because he as he put it it was just like christmas

10:49.752 --> 11:15.456
and if you go in there and you ask them something 
with big tears in your eyes doc's quotations it

10:49.752 --> 11:15.456
would be hard for them to say no and so doc was was 
very good at getting people to do things for him It

11:16.499 --> 11:18.722
was really sort of like Santa Claus. He just didn't 
want to say no. Now, he retired in 64, I believe it

11:22.146 --> 11:28.354
was, and Charles Holland stepped in. There was no 
search, as such. In those days, you didn't do

11:31.338 --> 11:33.521
things like that. In fact, I interviewed Holland, 
and he said, how about it? He thought about it.

11:38.567 --> 11:41.230
Maybe that one day, he said, okay. Right. We 
actually knew, I'd say, at least a year in advance,

11:46.385 --> 11:53.192
We knew probably back in 63, because there were 
really no secrets with Bob Quincy. He said, I'm

11:53.552 --> 12:04.103
going to recommend Charlie Holland to succeed me 
as department head, and it's all pretty well

11:53.552 --> 12:04.103
decided. So that was all done very smoothly, and 
like you say, nowadays we'd spend a year and a half

12:04.423 --> 12:15.835
doing a full-blown search. now that was a very nice 
smooth transition now and then the next big moment

12:17.232 --> 12:36.372
i guess now roman is growing rather nicely

12:38.107 --> 12:51.164
I think there's some

12:38.107 --> 12:51.164
of that. There's excitement everywhere. I'm 
trying to say you are. Back in, I believe, about

12:59.154 --> 13:08.046
1963 or 1964,

13:09.275 --> 13:16.865
Because when I first came to A&M, I did some 
research into plasma arc jets. This is not blood

13:16.885 --> 13:21.951
plasma, but this is very high temperature ionized 
gas plasma. And in doing that, then I came under

13:22.492 --> 13:28.099
some NASA grants. And so I did research for NASA 
from about 64 to the late 60s. And so, I mean, I

13:37.861 --> 13:44.869
particularly had some interest in the space 
program. Yes,

13:45.229 --> 13:55.881
yes, we went down there usually once a year for a 
general NASA-type briefing. But I don't think

13:57.523 --> 14:03.750
anybody else in the department was really tied to 
NASA. You know, as such, there was more

14:05.030 --> 14:15.102
connections, of course, over in the aeronautical 
engineering department.

14:15.122 --> 14:26.496
Now, the other big thing, of course, that happened 
was, 67 through 68 was when we became Texas A&M

14:15.122 --> 14:26.496
University.

14:28.879 --> 14:33.484
We also admitted, we formally admitted women. and 
we did away with the compulsory core during the

14:34.257 --> 14:38.003
first two years. So there were really a lot of 
changes here, and we started seeing, we started

14:39.225 --> 14:49.082
almost immediately seeing a great number of women 
coming into the chemical engineering classes.

14:49.683 --> 14:58.678
You probably wouldn't remember this, but in the 
material I've dug up, the first two women I see

14:49.683 --> 14:58.678
enrolled must have come about 1907, wasn't it 
Hannah? Prescott,

14:59.536 --> 15:12.490
Eddard Batcher

14:59.536 --> 15:12.490
and Prescott. Batcher and Prescott, I don't 
remember their names. But they were definitely

15:16.377 --> 15:20.242
listed as sophomores in 71. Soon they came in in 72. 
And then by 1975, I had a note from Hollis that there

15:22.685 --> 15:30.195
were 20 of them enrolled. I think we had a special 
enrollment in 75 before it. 20 of whom were women.

15:35.441 --> 15:38.625
And of course, there were two of them who were out 
there. Do you have any special recollection of the

15:38.645 --> 15:45.574
first women or anything like that in the program or 
graduates? Well, actually, at least here, we had

15:46.550 --> 15:57.642
women as undergraduates long before we had any as 
graduate students. And the first women here as

15:57.922 --> 16:08.474
undergraduates were, they were very 
distinguished because they were all Cracker Jack

15:57.922 --> 16:08.474
students. They were really good. And I remember 
somewhere around 75, I was giving an exam, and a guy

16:17.245 --> 16:26.955
One of the male students said to me, Dr. Eubank, you 
should count yourself lucky that you never had to

16:17.245 --> 16:26.955
compete with these smart female students. And I 
thought, that's right. Now later on, then, as we

16:28.717 --> 16:41.390
had more women, and we're now about one third 
undergraduates of women, then it started to level

16:28.717 --> 16:41.390
out. And we'd pick up women who were nuts. such 
strong students, so they became more the average.

16:47.184 --> 16:50.869
I imagine the early ones were really competitive, 
too. They had to be... Yes, they were. Often, I

16:53.834 --> 17:05.933
mean, some of those earlier classes, if you looked 
at the very top students, the ones that were above,

16:53.834 --> 17:05.933
say, a 3.4 out of 4, they'd be half women. even 
though women were making up maybe 20-25% of the

17:06.233 --> 17:09.936
class. How about places

17:10.857 --> 17:17.003
in the market? Was there any difficulties, or was 
it more just pretty much women? Well, actually,

17:18.364 --> 17:25.871
they were much in demand, because the companies 
were trying to fill quotas. And I guess one of our

17:26.232 --> 17:35.160
early students, probably not the first, I just 
happen to remember, was a gal named Linda

17:36.119 --> 17:40.524
Gonzalez, who was A&M Beauty Queen that year. One 
Linda? Linda. Linda Gonzalez. And so Linda was not

17:45.991 --> 17:53.920
only strikingly good looking, but she was also 
Mexican-American female. And so she was really

17:54.101 --> 17:59.848
fought after by companies to be hired. She was also 
a very good student. She graduated about 3.3 or

18:02.170 --> 18:06.075
3.4. She

18:06.427 --> 18:12.094
went with Chicago Bridge and Iron. Yes, she did. 
And I heard from her father maybe 15 years ago that

18:16.699 --> 18:28.232
she was still with them and had a very good career. 
Now

18:29.173 --> 18:34.780
as the faculty now, There have been a number of 
recent hirings about the training came on, and

18:35.198 --> 18:51.081
Harvey came in, and Anthony came in, and Anthony 
came in. But it was a change of nature. You moved in

18:51.722 --> 18:56.970
in 72, to exactly the big

18:51.722 --> 18:56.970
room. Yes.

19:02.481 --> 19:21.370
Let

19:02.481 --> 19:21.370
me

19:02.481 --> 19:21.370
first say, Leo Durbin came in September of 61, 
right after I came. We really came about the same

19:21.391 --> 19:22.973
time. But then after that, Ron Darby came in, I 
believe, in 65. And then in 67, I think both... Dan

19:29.526 --> 19:40.177
Hanson came, I believe, in 67, and I'm trying to 
remember. I think Ray Anthony may have come that

19:40.237 --> 19:43.060
year, maybe a year later. Yeah, I didn't know you 
were in 54 or 65. I've been in 54 or 65. So both Darby

19:48.967 --> 19:53.372
and Clem were in second, and you made it in 67. Yeah, 
so there's quite a... an increase in the staff

19:55.135 --> 20:00.022
about that time. But, sorry, back to your... One 
thing, Holland apparently consciously, and I

20:00.182 --> 20:12.360
don't know if it was a consciously added policy, 
was planning to hire young people. Yes. And it

20:14.063 --> 20:15.866
seems to have worked. Yes, that was a conscious 
policy, at least after I came here and was

20:15.886 --> 20:23.016
involved, That was definitely our policy. We were 
trying to hire young faculty.

20:31.999 --> 20:33.343
We concluded that was simply the way to go. It seems 
to really work, because the department

20:35.215 --> 20:44.965
congealed, and people grew in the department, and 
you had a good 20 or 30 year stay in there. Yes.

20:45.766 --> 20:46.747
Because of that policy. And I think about that, 
because a lot of times, especially in the modern

20:47.308 --> 21:01.643
day, the way you try to bring in some big top dog, the 
impact on the academic world is minimal. I think

21:03.344 --> 21:05.608
you have to grow your own. You really do. I like 
that, the more I think about it, yes. But, no,

21:09.475 --> 21:10.156
you're right. That was a conscious policy. And the 
Department of Supervision had a very strong sense

21:12.961 --> 21:23.200
of cohesion and identity, which is unusual in the 
life of the United States. Life's very good. Yes.

21:25.403 --> 21:27.868
But that was wrong. Yes. But your question on... 
Yeah, two characters that I've tried to really put

21:28.741 --> 21:35.509
in place. Mikey, who I think was brought in from...

21:43.599 --> 21:44.620
Yes. Dr. Mikey was here when I came, and he was the 
director of the cottonseed oil laboratory. I

21:55.573 --> 21:58.697
think he came in under... The Calhoun-Benson 
program, everybody needs to teach themselves.

22:04.404 --> 22:06.487
Yes, I think that's right. And I know he taught some 
courses. He had all his degrees, I think, in

22:09.752 --> 22:13.357
chemical engineering. He was a very pleasant man.

22:20.907 --> 22:22.289
He couldn't walk well. He had a very pronounced 
limb. But anyway,

22:26.234 --> 22:40.048
he was a very pleasant person who was quite low-key 
and very easy to get along with. But he didn't

22:40.068 --> 22:47.336
really play a major, I mean, I'd say he didn't play a 
real major effect on me. That's part of what I said,

22:47.356 --> 22:49.298
yeah. Some of the Right. And then, of course, Bill 
Harris interacted a lot, because he was also in

22:54.713 --> 22:59.584
Cotswold. Yeah, he got drafted the same way, 
apparently.

23:10.488 --> 23:12.492
Right, right. Now, what about Wynarty? Wynarty 
came in in, you know, about 1758, and came in and

23:14.265 --> 23:27.141
started controlling something, and then the next 
year got promoted to fourth professor of chemical

23:14.265 --> 23:27.141
engineering. Yes. Do you know anything about all 
of that? Yes. Well, Dick Wynarty was here from when

23:30.766 --> 23:39.998
I came in, and I've become social, first of all. 
friends with Dick and his wife. And like you say,

23:46.461 --> 23:50.888
his degrees are all in petroleum engineering. And 
Dick had gotten his Ph.D. degree in petroleum

23:50.908 --> 23:56.376
engineering from the University of Oklahoma.

24:03.166 --> 24:07.272
But his Ph.D. advisor was John Calhoun. So that's 
There was an original Calhoun-Linardi

24:09.577 --> 24:14.864
connection outside of A&M. So after John Calhoun 
came here, then he later brought in Dick Linardi.

24:22.174 --> 24:29.644
And Dick ran what was called the Activation 
Analysis Laboratory. And we're just talking

24:30.826 --> 24:34.190
about the space program. But Dick was in charge of a 
program whereby they would bend a rocket to the

24:38.602 --> 25:05.496
moon, and then Dick's lab was in charge of 
designing a little robot that had a shovel on it,

24:38.602 --> 25:05.496
and it was shoveled up a little bit of moon dirt, and 
then it was going to bring it back here, and they

24:38.602 --> 25:05.496
were going to subject this moon dirt to activation 
analysis to get a complete chemical analysis of

24:38.602 --> 25:05.496
the Earth or the moon. Okay, good. That's a good 
story. That's a good time. Yeah. So, Dick was very

25:08.234 --> 25:14.421
much involved with NASA, and had a great deal of 
research running in him. Big laboratory, and Emil

25:15.242 --> 25:31.139
Schweikert, who I think is still head of chemistry 
over here, was his original really top scientist,

25:15.242 --> 25:31.139
because Emil was a chemist and knew all about 
analysis. So, Dick had sort of gotten himself off

25:31.159 --> 25:36.705
into some things that were more chemical, and he So 
later, I remember we agreed to have him as a

25:37.732 --> 25:49.085
professor in chemical engineering, because he 
needed a home base. Okay, that's kind of what I

25:49.245 --> 25:50.526
thought. Did he ever teach that? No, I don't think 
he ever taught anything in chemical engineering.

25:57.094 --> 26:04.262
He did teach an activation analysis course, and a 
number of our students, I think, took the course.

26:05.103 --> 26:11.849
Now, and I think even Swiker appeared at one time as 
a professor . Yes, I think so. I think Swiker,

26:12.830 --> 26:21.498
because we tried to align ourselves somewhat with 
the activation analysis, it was... That's the

26:12.830 --> 26:21.498
synopsis. Yes, they had a lot of research money, 
and, uh, and for when Ernie was quite politically

26:21.518 --> 26:32.528
powerful here at one time, and so, and frankly, we 
all We got along very well with Dick, and

26:32.778 --> 26:39.584
enjoyed working with him. Later,

26:39.804 --> 26:53.936
one

26:39.804 --> 26:53.936
of his sons graduated with a degree in chemical 
engineering. Anyway, Dick had sort of a long

26:54.316 --> 27:02.143
history, and I think he's still the administrator 
down in Houston Yeah, for the medical...well,

27:03.153 --> 27:15.912
it's the entire medical complex down there that 
Dick administrates. He said not too long ago, he

27:15.972 --> 27:27.068
said he's in charge of finding parking spaces for 
all the medical doctors.

27:27.605 --> 27:28.426
Well, good. That really helped. Now,

27:29.287 --> 27:48.452
one thing you really became involved in was the 
extension, forces, and we can't just talk forces.

27:50.055 --> 27:50.355
Yes. When I came in in 61, they had had a program

27:56.326 --> 28:11.959
for about 10, 12 years with Dow Chemical in 
Freeport,

27:56.326 --> 28:11.959
where we went in and taught one graduate course a 
semester. We'd teach it on Friday night from 6 to 9

28:12.180 --> 28:17.004
o'clock. We'd teach three hours, which would 
cover more than the three one-hour lectures here.

28:26.465 --> 28:43.510
And then the students down there, all of whom had a 
BS degree already, the students could then gather

28:26.465 --> 28:43.510
in one course a semester, and eventually they'd 
get enough courses that they could come up here and

28:26.465 --> 28:43.510
finish off a Master of Engineering by spending one 
summer here. But they'd have to take these courses

28:45.052 --> 28:52.202
for about two to three years, or get together 
enough courses. And this program was going good.

28:54.980 --> 29:00.507
And then I was to teach, I think it was transport 
phenomenon in the fall of 61. But I never did,

29:02.930 --> 29:15.586
because Hurricane Carla hit Texas, I believe, in 
late August or early September of 1961 and almost

29:02.930 --> 29:15.586
destroyed Dow Chemical, at least put it under four 
feet of water. So Dow spent the entire fall

29:16.647 --> 29:21.413
semester trying to dry out. But then later, I did 
teach a number of times at Freeport. And then, I'm

29:27.740 --> 29:39.932
not sure I have the dates all exactly right, but 
going into the 1970s, we greatly expanded this

29:27.740 --> 29:39.932
graduate extension program. And we ended up at one 
time with five centers down at Freeport. Texas

29:48.764 --> 29:57.114
City, where we taught for Monsanto carbide and 
American oil. In the old Monsanto plant, we taught

29:59.878 --> 30:02.801
at Texas City. And then we taught Texas Eastman at 
Longview. Actually taught it in Kilgore Junior

30:08.188 --> 30:11.992
High School, which was pretty nice. But that was 
all Texas Eastman Kodak. Then we taught at Corpus

30:19.577 --> 30:31.434
Christi for Salonese and Pittsburgh White Glass, 
which at that time was a major company in Corpus. We

30:32.996 --> 30:44.893
also taught at Victoria at the Stroman High 
School, and we were teaching, it was all carbide,

30:32.996 --> 30:44.893
Port Lavaca plant, and DuPont I forget the name of 
the DuPont plant down there, but it's near the

30:45.920 --> 30:50.945
carbide plant.

30:52.827 --> 31:09.706
So we were very busy with this program for a while, 
and it had some very positive effects, because

30:52.827 --> 31:09.706
people would take a master's this way, and then 
they would decide they want a Ph.D. degree. As one

31:09.726 --> 31:10.847
example, we Never in those days could we get an 
undergraduate student from the University of

31:11.283 --> 31:17.610
Texas to come over here and do graduate work. The 
good UT undergraduates were all sent to the north

31:18.531 --> 31:23.217
to the top ten ranked schools. Well, under this 
program, we ended up with about three or four PhDs

31:24.418 --> 31:33.689
who were undergraduate longhorns who ended up 
with a PhD degree from A&M. In fact, one of them is

31:35.050 --> 31:40.176
still a professor at Arizona State and is well 
known for some textbooks. anyway we had some good

31:40.645 --> 32:09.623
people who uh once we went into the plants and 
started teaching them uh they decided these

31:40.645 --> 32:09.623
aggies weren't too bad and they ended up at a m for a 
phd degree i expected that that complimented

31:40.645 --> 32:09.623
it really did because yes and we would walk in uh 
like in the fall to dow chemical they would just

31:40.645 --> 32:09.623
have hired probably 100 chemical engineers. And 
they would use us as a recruiting tool, saying that

32:13.426 --> 32:24.957
Freeport wasn't the end of the world, and that they 
could get a master's degree by night school right

32:13.426 --> 32:24.957
there in the plant. And we'd walk into a class that 
had 40 or 50 people, and their degrees would be from

32:25.818 --> 32:31.444
all over the country. So we'd have everybody in 
that class. And it was a lot of fun to teach them. And

32:39.320 --> 32:53.298
we were, as professors, we were paid extra to teach 
those courses. So we were reasonably well in the

32:53.318 --> 32:59.587
first, but it was sort of a blast. When I first 
started, because I was still quite young, I would

33:05.122 --> 33:14.071
just drive to Freeport on Friday afternoon, teach 
the class for three hours, and jump back in my car

33:05.122 --> 33:14.071
and drive back here. I'd usually be back here by 
midnight or a little after. But later I got to the

33:18.495 --> 33:23.100
point where I always stayed over because I 
couldn't face the trip. And usually, well, with

33:24.361 --> 33:31.568
Corpus, what I did was, in those days I drove to 
Austin Airport and took a plane in. Corpus was not

33:31.733 --> 33:39.205
really easy to get to, and it's about a five-hour 
drive, so it's a little far to drive. But we all

33:39.225 --> 33:49.923
drove to Kilgore in Texas City, and I think, yeah, 
we all drove to Victoria, which is about a

33:39.225 --> 33:49.923
three-hour drive.

33:55.552 --> 33:58.517
In the short courses, And you were pretty much as 
well involved in both existing and short courses

33:58.885 --> 34:03.790
as well. Yes. Another job that Doc Lindsay talked 
me into when I first arrived was to take over the

34:05.071 --> 34:26.952
instrumentation short course, which was 
started, I believe, in 1946 here at A&M

34:05.071 --> 34:26.952
by bringing instrument companies up and having a 
about a three-day symposium, involved both the

34:27.674 --> 34:34.102
users and vendors of instruments. And later on, 
this got into a lot more of computer control and

34:35.063 --> 34:42.332
computer companies. So it rapidly was becoming 
very high-tech. But this was started by Doc

34:46.617 --> 34:52.304
Lindsay and some industrial people in 1946. And 
later, Charlie Holland and had gotten a job of

34:57.053 --> 34:58.935
being director. And that worked quite well. But 
then after that, because when I first came here,

35:02.039 --> 35:08.467
Charlie Holland was really doing everything. He 
was handling all the odd jobs for the department.

35:13.313 --> 35:23.306
And so Charlie was very glad to see me come, because 
I immediately got all the odd jobs at the

35:13.313 --> 35:23.306
department, including instrumentation and 
symposium. And it was in quite a mess for that time,

35:26.787 --> 35:35.880
It had been given to a PhD student for the last two 
years, and its enrollment had sunk to, I think it

35:26.787 --> 35:35.880
was 150. And so one of my first jobs was to 
reorganize the Consultation Symposium, get the

35:38.244 --> 35:49.420
Industrial Steering Committee back together. So 
I had that job for five years. from 61 through 66,

35:55.930 --> 36:05.322
and we got the enrollment back up to about 450, and 
got it back pretty good shape. And that's

36:05.523 --> 36:07.385
completely outside of my field. I had nothing to 
do, and still don't understand process control

36:07.445 --> 36:11.190
very well. And also at that time, I got Leo Durbin 
involved, who is in process control, and so Leo

36:13.353 --> 36:24.688
started handling the technical program for the 
meeting, which was a pretty good job in itself. But

36:28.397 --> 36:35.003
that's still going on strong, and they just met, I 
think it was last week. It's always in January,

36:35.023 --> 36:46.213
usually in the middle of a snowstorm or a sleet or 
something, but it's quite good, and people come

36:35.023 --> 36:46.213
from all over the country. In fact, it's still the 
second largest instrumentation symposium in the

36:47.274 --> 36:53.680
world, next to the ISA annual. It

36:55.583 --> 37:17.482
may have been. I'm trying to remember. I'll put you 
down in that so you can claim that thing right now.

37:24.035 --> 37:36.067
I'm just wondering, to really kind of verify it 
before, if there's a note in the archive that was

37:24.035 --> 37:36.067
part of the faculty file that makes you get that. 
And I'm not, you know, positive that there's a

37:36.187 --> 37:41.172
letter in the book that says that. In other words, 
the South Texas chapter, that started early. Oh,

37:45.197 --> 37:45.837
yes. And you've probably run across the fact that 
the South Texas section of AICG, which was the

37:46.258 --> 37:53.485
largest, by far the largest, section of AICG in the 
country. It's now a powerful, dominant section.

37:59.999 --> 38:04.165
The last two presidents of AICG are Texans. 
Anyway, they are one powerful section. But they

38:08.792 --> 38:18.105
were founded by Doc Lindsey Chalmers Kirkbride, 
who was then professor here at A&M, and a couple

38:08.792 --> 38:18.105
other people. But the early officers, the first 
officers of the South Texas Section included, I

38:18.558 --> 38:25.627
think, Kirk Wright was president and Lindsey was 
secretary or something. Well, but the student

38:27.370 --> 38:42.330
chapter here, I'm a little bit uncertain about, 
because, see, I thought that even when I first came

38:27.370 --> 38:42.330
here, there was a student chapter. I know it 
bounced around, and like a lot of other

38:42.410 --> 38:47.957
organizations, it may have... sort of died out, 
and we had to re-buy it. But I'm not sure I want to

38:52.825 --> 38:57.330
claim credit for, you know, for really... Okay, 
but you did become an advisor, right? Yeah, I was an

38:58.972 --> 39:06.502
advisor at the time, and I may have sort of re-buyed 
it if it was, you know, not in too good of shape, but

38:58.972 --> 39:06.502
I'm not sure. Before I forget, I'm sorry to 
interrupt, but there was one thing I should make

39:07.823 --> 39:15.953
sure you get in here, because it's typical. This 
was back in Doc Lindsay's regime, but just rung a

39:16.692 --> 39:29.271
bell, and that is that Grace Lindsay had a thing 
that she'd started right after the Second World

39:16.692 --> 39:29.271
War. We had a lot of students here who, of course, 
would come back to our services, and they were

39:29.291 --> 39:35.220
married. And so Grace Lindsay had a thing every 
year where she gave to the spouses of the graduates

39:35.841 --> 39:45.315
a diploma. which was called the PhD degree, 
putting hubby through degree. And this was held at

39:53.421 --> 39:57.146
her house every year with great fanfare. And what 
Grace did that made this really such a great place

39:57.327 --> 40:11.228
for the students was she had socials for the wives 
of the students, I think two or three every

39:57.327 --> 40:11.228
semester. She got to know them, and she provided a 
lot of support for those student wives. And of

40:19.856 --> 40:26.544
course, they were all Doc Lindsey's boys, and they 
still are.

40:29.387 --> 40:39.519
And most of them will tell you they've never 
forgotten Doc Lindsey, because he really formed

40:29.387 --> 40:39.519
what we call now bonds with the students. I mean, he 
bonded with every student here.

40:45.353 --> 40:45.794
That's good. I'm glad you mentioned about Grace, 
because she's kind of, you know, not very obvious

40:45.854 --> 40:55.389
of a term. I felt like she obviously had to have some 
support. And even I talked with you, and, you know,

40:58.053 --> 41:03.581
you didn't have to say that. Well, Grace... Her dad 
ran an iron shop for her. He had four sons. He had

41:10.652 --> 41:12.295
those kind of sons. He did, and... Well, I remember 
when I first came, it was kind of humorous, because

41:14.615 --> 41:22.829
at that time, Doc knew that his two oldest sons were 
turning out just great. I mean, there's no

41:22.889 --> 41:24.912
question they were already on their way. His 
oldest son was teaching school already down in

41:26.395 --> 41:38.074
Houston, and Jim Lindsey, his second son, had 
already set up shop here in Bryan as a GP. But

41:39.202 --> 41:43.468
anyway, he wasn't too sure about Hugh and Mark. He 
said, well, they're still pretty young. And they

41:46.031 --> 41:49.656
both turned out great, too. But Grace was really an 
exceptionally fine lady. And Doc always said that

41:55.965 --> 42:04.517
any of his success was largely due to her.

42:07.568 --> 42:26.339
And she was really the perfect department head's 
wife, because she was very personal, but also very

42:07.568 --> 42:26.339
laid back, and not at all pushy, and just a very 
pleasant person who worked in well with everybody

42:07.568 --> 42:26.339
like Grace. Now, let me jump ahead to another 
question. How did

42:31.480 --> 43:00.812
that impact on the rest of the decade ?

43:01.990 --> 43:31.947
No,

43:01.990 --> 43:31.947
driving while so high, crude oil that high, did 
have some positive effects on our research.

43:33.884 --> 43:40.450
People like the National Science Foundation 
started paying a lot more attention to

43:33.884 --> 43:40.450
petroleum-related research. And they also 
started paying more attention to the engineering

43:40.871 --> 43:47.798
side. They had previously been more, quote, 
scientific. They are the National Science

43:53.563 --> 43:55.125
Foundation. But they then became much more 
interested in applied research problems,

43:55.145 --> 44:03.233
particularly related to petroleum.

44:07.544 --> 44:11.468
So it did have some, perhaps, positive effects. 
But otherwise, in the teaching, most of the

44:13.410 --> 44:20.678
mission here, it didn't, I wouldn't say it had 
dramatic effects.

44:24.182 --> 44:32.190
That's good.

44:33.065 --> 44:37.851
The market still remained strong in the 70s. Do you 
remember any of that? Yes. Not

44:40.514 --> 45:02.481
very good, but there was a time in there, I believe 
it wasn't until maybe the latter 70s when there was

44:40.514 --> 45:02.481
some years in there when it crashed and chemical 
engineers then couldn't find jobs. We've gone

45:02.613 --> 45:12.066
through, since I've been here, we've gone through 
two or three periods like this where it was

45:02.613 --> 45:12.066
actually difficult for chemical engineers to get 
jobs. And this was after years of where everybody

45:12.487 --> 45:22.602
would get five job offers and could take their pick 
and it didn't matter if they were not too strong of

45:12.487 --> 45:22.602
students. But we then went through some years 
where it was difficult. And what we had to do as a

45:26.127 --> 45:28.570
department was to usually go out and take about the 
bottom third of the class and get on the telephone

45:29.782 --> 45:35.792
and find them jobs. And that's where our network of 
having so many Aggie graduates of this department

45:36.773 --> 45:45.127
really paid off. Because we've graduated a fair 
number of people over a long period of time, as has

45:46.970 --> 45:54.422
the University of Texas at Austin, And together, 
we have a lot of old guys out there that are in key

45:55.010 --> 46:00.795
management positions. Can you identify any 
special ones that you've looked at? There are

46:04.998 --> 46:07.981
quite a large number. Now, when we formed the first 
Lindsay Lectures Committee, this was, I think, in

46:08.001 --> 46:20.812
about, say, 78. It was two years before Doc Lindsay 
passed away, but I'm just sort of reading off the

46:25.857 --> 46:33.524
letterhead here that has our committee members. 
There are people like Bruner Barnes, who founded

46:33.544 --> 46:39.609
Barnes and Quick Company in Dallas. Is there 
identification with their business there? Yes.

46:43.733 --> 46:44.373
Great. That's perfect. Are all of these former 
students? Yeah, these are all former students.

46:49.978 --> 46:50.379
Excellent. And let's see, I kind of think... Well, 
Paul Dicer is still very much active, and he's a

46:54.916 --> 47:02.164
retired vice president of Shell a while. I might 
use that list in the book. That might be, would that
