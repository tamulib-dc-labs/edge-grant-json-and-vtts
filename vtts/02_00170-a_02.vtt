WEBVTT

00:02.663 --> 00:04.987
as associate dean, as far as you recall? Yes. I 
don't remember it being assistant dean. I believe

00:07.992 --> 00:09.294
it was associate dean. And that was only for part 
time because the other part of his assignment, he,

00:09.875 --> 00:18.630
I believe, was a faculty member in petroleum 
engineering. He wrote most of the grant proposals

00:19.403 --> 00:23.709
coming out of the dean's office at that time. We did 
not have a research foundation, as most of us know

00:23.809 --> 00:30.799
the research foundation here at A&M today. We had a 
small office that helped with some of the

00:31.480 --> 00:35.346
paperwork of grant writing. But Dr. Winerdi was 
very much into proposal writing to try to receive

00:39.772 --> 00:48.621
additional federal funds for various issues on 
campus and initiatives that were undergoing at

00:39.772 --> 00:48.621
that time. And it was very successful. Some of the 
staff was intimidated by him because he was high

00:51.244 --> 01:01.754
profile, fast worker, and had high expectations 
for the staff. Some found it very stressful to work

01:02.755 --> 01:05.038
under him. I enjoyed it. I loved the challenge. He 
had come from Penn State, I think. Did Benson hire

01:13.698 --> 01:15.821
him or did Calhoun? No, Benson actually, well, I'm 
not sure that I know the answer to that. I don't know

01:21.751 --> 01:22.612
that. I know that he had been a doctoral student of 
Calhoun's. Up there. Right. So I don't really know

01:28.863 --> 01:31.707
which one actually hired him. As far as you know, 
was he hired... When he arrived on the campus, was

01:34.261 --> 01:37.386
he hired in the dean's office? No, he was hired as a 
faculty member, I believe, and then part-time in

01:37.406 --> 01:43.597
the dean's office, yes. Who was at the college 
level in those years, who was the student advisor

01:43.617 --> 01:55.037
counselor, the job that Ramsdell would have 
later? McGuire was the advisor for the students.

02:00.546 --> 02:09.904
Yes, usually what we saw was the top students, the 
president of the student body, I mean the student

02:00.546 --> 02:09.904
insurance council, president of Tall Beta Pi. We 
saw the upper end of the students and then we saw the

02:11.446 --> 02:17.498
probation students more than anything, but we'd 
have the other students in between. Let me go back

02:18.811 --> 02:21.236
to Dr. Winerdi for just a moment. Oh, please do. The 
Texas Engineering Experiment Station was being

02:22.198 --> 02:26.889
established. And one of Dr. Winerdi's titles was, 
I believe, Assistant Director of the Texas

02:28.011 --> 02:34.525
Engineering Experiment Station. And, of course, 
he just office... in the dean's office as part of

02:37.171 --> 02:53.063
his associate dean but also very much from the 
experiment station side and that's why he was so

02:37.171 --> 02:53.063
heavily involved in writing proposals and trying 
to get his center for activation analysis off the

02:37.171 --> 02:53.063
ground when we were working in that area. So that 
was part of his duties. As far as you were aware in

02:56.813 --> 03:08.791
that era, what was the status, reputation, 
quality of the engineering program at Texas A&M

02:56.813 --> 03:08.791
compared to other schools? Well, there were 
certain departments that were well respected.

03:15.401 --> 03:21.250
Petroleum engineering was one of the top in the 
50s, and of course still is today at Texas A&M. We

03:22.632 --> 03:25.757
had a few master's programs. I'm not sure that we 
had any doctoral programs in the 50s. If we did, it

03:31.233 --> 03:32.856
was very limited. And I know that Mr. Benson was 
very anxious to see more doctoral programs

03:33.838 --> 03:40.754
established within engineering. And he worked 
hard at, I believe, He was working on proposals for

03:45.498 --> 03:51.226
the doctor of engineering and some of the other 
engineering programs at that time. But we had few

03:51.246 --> 03:53.450
that were established. Industrial engineering 
was a well-respected department at that time. And

03:57.776 --> 04:08.872
of course, industry hired students graduating 
from the College of Engineering had no problem

03:57.776 --> 04:08.872
receiving job offers and usually multiple job 
offers. And that was in almost any discipline.

04:11.097 --> 04:16.145
Now, were there any programs that, as far as you all 
knew, were kind of marginal then in engineering? I

04:16.586 --> 04:17.447
wasn't aware of it. That was not part of my job 
assignment, so if there were marginal, I might not

04:18.850 --> 04:23.176
have known that. Aerospace was ranked very high at 
that time, still because of... Post-war things,

04:29.103 --> 04:33.453
there was still a lot of need for aerospace 
engineers. Geology and geophysics students were

04:34.175 --> 04:41.812
receiving more offers than they could handle, and 
certainly those that double majored with

04:34.175 --> 04:41.812
petroleum engineering. And in every field, the 
job market seemed to be good, didn't it? Yes,

04:47.395 --> 04:49.898
mechanical, electrical. Nuclear engineering 
was coming into being, and they had hired John

04:50.979 --> 04:56.826
Randall to come in here and build up the nuclear 
engineering department. So there wasn't nearly

04:57.367 --> 05:04.055
as large a faculty there in nuclear engineering as 
there were later, in later years. And engineering

05:04.075 --> 05:11.884
buildings and facilities were northeast of the 
academic building? They were off of University

05:13.906 --> 05:17.913
Avenue and Texas Avenue, yes. All on the main side 
of the campus, correct. The department heads, who

05:22.139 --> 05:25.285
were some that you remember during that era? Well, 
I remember Mr. Whiting. I guess he was head of

05:28.570 --> 05:33.278
petroleum engineering even when Don was here, 
because I remember Mr. Whiting. Dr. Semang was

05:34.159 --> 05:37.905
head of mechanical engineering.

05:42.037 --> 05:48.147
Dr. Jones might have been head of electrical 
engineering, but I'm not sure that he was in the

05:42.037 --> 05:48.147
50s. He was later. I can't remember that. Were 
there any... Mr. Burgess in industrial

05:51.593 --> 05:54.278
engineering. Dr. Burgess in industrial 
engineering. Aerospace, I can't remember.

06:01.510 --> 06:02.492
Geology... and geophysics were under 
engineering at that time, and I can't remember who

06:04.430 --> 06:08.598
was head of that. It was not a college of geoscience 
at that time. Were there any faculty member and or

06:11.164 --> 06:16.214
department heads that y'all had to handle with kid 
gloves? Well, I'm sure there were, but I didn't

06:17.316 --> 06:19.821
know who they were. Mr. Vincent kept that from us, 
so we All right, back to being a student wife. So you

06:30.530 --> 06:35.635
would leave for work 7.30 or so. Where was parking? 
It wasn't too far from the building because

06:39.078 --> 06:43.802
parking was not a problem on campus at that time. A 
lot of people walked to campus from... Were there

06:45.704 --> 06:46.865
parking stickers? I don't remember any. I got here 
in 59. I don't remember any parking stickers. I

06:52.860 --> 06:56.143
don't remember that as being problematic at all. 
Where did a student wife shop? Well, there was... I

07:03.709 --> 07:07.812
first started, shopped at what was called Wine 
Gardens in Varine. Wine Gardens was here then? I

07:10.695 --> 07:13.197
think it was called Wine Gardens. And then Early 
Bird Shopping Center on Texas Avenue.

07:20.907 --> 07:25.854
I came in and there was a grocery store, I'm not sure 
what the name of it was, might have been Orr's. And

07:27.075 --> 07:32.202
those two were, and there was an A&P downtown brine 
I shopped. I remember having to do that. You

07:34.485 --> 07:39.272
usually went once a week to downtown brine to buy 
your groceries and your meats. And we carefully

07:39.332 --> 07:41.936
budgeted. We tried never to spend more than $25 a 
week on groceries. And out here near the campus,

07:47.300 --> 07:54.708
there was nothing you could buy much beyond what a 
convenience store today would have. Is that

07:54.768 --> 07:55.249
right? There was a little bitty place at South Gate 
when we got here. We could buy bread and milk. But I

08:03.478 --> 08:12.569
guess I never shopped there because I think the 
only thing that I shopped was A&P and the Overs and

08:03.478 --> 08:12.569
Wine Gardens when it came in. And where did you go to 
shop for clothing for anybody? downtown Bryan,

08:16.848 --> 08:21.574
and there was a JCPenney's. There was fabric 
stores, and we made a lot of our own clothing,

08:22.816 --> 08:29.544
particularly mine.

08:32.729 --> 08:34.491
There was a men's clothing store. There was a 
Lester's, but we were careful when we shopped at

08:34.511 --> 08:43.142
Lester's, had to shop the sales because we 
couldn't afford the clothing.

08:46.177 --> 08:49.723
I don't remember any other names that we 
particularly shopped at. And if you all were going

08:50.944 --> 08:58.036
to go out to eat, how often did you do so? Oh, no more 
than once a month. We usually didn't go out. We

09:01.581 --> 09:12.278
might get together with friends and do a cookout, 
save our money, buy some steaks, put them on the

09:01.581 --> 09:12.278
grill, make homemade ice cream, but we saved our 
money to buy those steaks. I can remember them.

09:14.830 --> 09:30.495
extremely interesting incident in which we saved 
our money to buy steaks and Dr. Jack Little who's

09:14.830 --> 09:30.495
just retired as president of Shell was a good 
friend of ours and his wife and they lived in an

09:14.830 --> 09:30.495
upstairs garage apartment down in Bryan. We saved 
money to buy steaks and the guys didn't get in to

09:31.216 --> 09:40.551
cook the steaks as early as we thought they should 
so Carolyn and I set up the cookers and got the fire

09:41.257 --> 09:46.303
going and got the stakes on ourselves and set it up 
on the driveway. And for some odd reason, we

09:46.323 --> 09:48.806
thought we needed to move the cooker. And when we 
did, the legs were not fastened as well as they

09:48.866 --> 09:52.510
should. And the stakes went over into the gravel. 
And so since we had saved her money all month to buy

09:56.835 --> 10:03.342
them, we took them upstairs, washed them and put 
them back on the grill. They were a little gritty.

10:04.679 --> 10:05.821
but we ate them anyway. We've laughed about that 
story many times, but it's true. At that special

10:10.126 --> 10:14.452
meal, what else was there other than steak? Oh, 
just green salad and a baked potato, and we'd make

10:14.893 --> 10:20.941
our own dessert, maybe usually a chocolate cake. 
And what kind of refreshments? Tea. Iced tea.

10:25.988 --> 10:26.288
Yeah. Iced tea. How often did, in College View, how 
often did student couples drink beer? Well, if you

10:35.375 --> 10:46.329
had any money left over at the end of the month, you 
might, on a Friday night or a Saturday night, ice

10:35.375 --> 10:46.329
down a few beers and drink them, but didn't have 
time to drink much beer. Do you remember anybody

10:46.870 --> 10:54.239
having a problem with drunkenness, any of the 
student, over in the student area? No, if there

10:54.880 --> 10:58.445
were problems, I wasn't aware of them. And what 
about noise, record players or radios or TVs? We

11:04.197 --> 11:06.059
didn't have any stereos. We had radio and TV. We 
didn't own a TV. And our neighbor owned a TV, and

11:11.206 --> 11:17.754
they lived... We just opened our front doors. We 
took the newspaper. They didn't have a newspaper,

11:18.915 --> 11:21.298
so we made a deal. They read our newspaper, and we'd 
watch the news on their TV. And we might have had one

11:24.161 --> 11:31.390
or two neighbors that their radio got a little 
loud, but other than that, we didn't have any

11:24.161 --> 11:31.390
problems. Were the windows screened? The windows 
were screened. Yes, that is correct. They were.

11:36.621 --> 11:38.744
But front doors were sometimes left open? Oh, 
yeah. We just left them open because it was so hot.

11:41.629 --> 11:46.676
And did anybody ever have any trouble with theft, 
burglary? No. We probably didn't even lock our

11:47.197 --> 11:49.079
cars at night. When you came to the campus in the 
daytime, did you lock your door at your apartment?

11:56.109 --> 11:58.152
We probably did, yes. But we didn't worry about it. 
Were you all churchgoers then? Yes, we were. There

12:03.629 --> 12:11.968
was First Christian Church in College Station 
that's now an interdenominational church on

12:03.629 --> 12:11.968
Welborn Road. Where was it then? Where was it 
located then? On Welborn Road. And we went to

12:16.017 --> 12:18.821
church there. Mainly it was convenient. There was 
a first Christian church down in Bryan, but this

12:20.743 --> 12:24.188
one was much more convenient. And a lot of the young 
people went out here and they had a student pastor

12:24.908 --> 12:32.919
that would come from TCU each week to be the pastor 
there. And that's where we went while we were in

12:33.179 --> 12:34.701
school. How big was it, members reckon? Probably 
no more than 100 people ever. 75 a Sunday usually,

12:42.916 --> 12:49.164
and they had a pretty good little Sunday school 
class for all the different ages. And I remember we

12:49.504 --> 12:54.330
went to the adult class and we took our child to the 
children's nursery. Yeah, was Screamin' Al

12:54.551 --> 12:58.456
Nelson a part of that group, history faculty 
member? Yes, he was. And the chemistry professor

12:59.557 --> 13:05.785
that would jump out the window, I'm trying to 
remember his name,

13:09.427 --> 13:10.769
Jump out the window of the church? No, of the 
chemistry department. The chemistry department

13:13.753 --> 13:25.149
windows are almost ground level, and he would jump 
out the window and go around and then throw in a test

13:13.753 --> 13:25.149
through the transom up over the top of the door. I'm 
trying to remember his name also. Who else were

13:28.754 --> 13:32.599
some leaders of that congregation that you 
remember?

13:35.988 --> 13:36.669
B.J. Adams and his wife attended there some. And 
they still live in the community today and are at

13:40.354 --> 13:45.040
First Christian in Bryan. And you all were regular 
attenders. Did you go other than Sunday morning?

13:52.550 --> 13:52.790
No. I think that was the only service, as a matter of 
fact, because we had a student pastor most of the

13:53.130 --> 13:58.397
time. No, we just went on Sundays. All right, and 
then if y'all were going to relax, and I've got the

14:00.963 --> 14:09.954
word recreation here, what did a young couple do to 
relax? You got together with friends and cooked a

14:09.974 --> 14:13.698
meal. That was about the extent of your 
recreation. And you might take in a movie once a

14:17.002 --> 14:19.325
month. There were a few drive-in movies here at 
that time. And so in the summer, we might take in a

14:22.869 --> 14:26.033
drive-in movie. Did y'all go to gun and haul 
movies? No, we didn't. The campus theater? Campus

14:34.226 --> 14:35.068
theater. Do you remember any special movies that 
were special? Probably the movie Giant came out in

14:40.440 --> 14:44.709
the 50s and we went to that. That was the big movie of 
the 50s. How often did you go back to Breckenridge?

14:51.149 --> 14:52.731
Oh, we only went on holidays. We had to have more 
than a day. We would probably go Thanksgiving,

14:55.454 --> 14:59.258
Christmas.

15:02.542 --> 15:05.025
That was probably the extent of our going back to 
Breckenridge. My father died in November of 57,

15:06.187 --> 15:12.494
and so I really had very little family left there 
after he died. I'm not sure we went too often. I'd go

15:16.178 --> 15:19.502
see my sister and brother, usually at 
Christmastime. Do you remember any special

15:19.837 --> 15:26.185
Christmas gifts during those student years that 
either you received or gave? No, not really. No.

15:30.690 --> 15:41.424
For graduation, Don's parents came from New York 
and gave him a portable black and white TV, and that

15:30.690 --> 15:41.424
was the first TV that we ever owned in May of 1960. So 
that was kind of a special gift. We thought we had

15:44.508 --> 15:47.211
really moved up into the technology field. And how 
did you all communicate with loved ones then that

15:47.545 --> 15:52.533
lived somewhere else? Well, we did have a 
telephone. Everyone in College View didn't have a

15:55.178 --> 15:59.244
phone, but we had a telephone from the time we moved 
in. And so we did make a few phone calls, and then we

15:59.865 --> 16:05.014
would write cards, handwritten cards. And that 
was how we communicated. See, think how special it

16:09.280 --> 16:13.704
would be if people had kept those. Think what a 
story could be told from those letters and so

16:14.725 --> 16:21.552
forth. Let's see, and during your student years 
here, there weren't any fires or tornadoes or

16:22.473 --> 16:30.681
there weren't any debacles like that, were there? 
Well, Carla came through. Oh, really? Describe

16:33.183 --> 16:35.305
that. Really how anyway it affected us was some 
people from the coast came in and needed housing,

16:36.331 --> 16:47.001
and so anyone that had any extra rooms, we 
volunteered our bedrooms and things for that. Did

16:47.541 --> 16:48.282
you all do that? No, we had children. We had Don at 
that time, and so we didn't do that. Did some of the

16:51.986 --> 16:54.248
others in College View do that? Yeah, they had 
space. They did do that. All right. Under

16:58.472 --> 17:04.397
recreation, describe going to your first 
football games at Texas A&M. Well, I can remember

17:04.495 --> 17:07.581
that how hot it was. There were lots of afternoon 
games. And it was so extremely hot. We were not used

17:13.671 --> 17:15.114
to the humidity. It's not nearly as humid in West 
Texas as it is here. And I can remember how

17:18.380 --> 17:25.513
extremely hot and buying ice was a real treat 
because that was what you did to survive it. How did

17:26.114 --> 17:28.478
y'all learn about the traditions?

17:32.626 --> 17:38.974
Unless Don went through them in orientation, I'm 
not sure how we did learn about traditions. You did

17:39.234 --> 17:41.176
stand up at the football games? Oh, yes. You stand 
up at the football games. Oh, yes. That was a very

17:43.299 --> 17:45.922
important part of it. And did married couples kiss 
after touchdowns? Oh, sure. Yes, yes. Stayed true

17:50.728 --> 17:52.750
to those traditions. And did you all go to midnight 
Yale practice? No, we never went to midnight Yale

17:55.133 --> 17:57.215
practice. Did you go to Silver Taps? No, we didn't. 
Muster? Yes, we went to Muster when it was held on

18:03.840 --> 18:07.884
campus, yes. And I don't remember, I guess it was 
held in Guyne Hall, but we didn't go out of town to

18:08.785 --> 18:15.413
any Muster ceremonies. But do you remember, did 
Muster make any impression on you at that? No,

18:19.558 --> 18:22.100
because we didn't know any of the people who had 
passed away. It made the impression it was a

18:22.441 --> 18:26.445
memorial, but we didn't know the people, so you 
weren't as involved. What about Bonfire? Yes, we

18:28.212 --> 18:29.654
went to some bonfires. We did go to bonfires, and it 
was just like a stack of wood being burnt, but

18:29.714 --> 18:39.888
nothing what you'd expect bonfire to be today, not 
nearly as rowdy. It was just a ceremony and yell

18:40.870 --> 18:43.754
practice. Did the married students get involved 
working on bonfires as far as you knew? If they did,

18:49.061 --> 18:53.988
I wasn't aware because my husband didn't have time 
to do that, so we weren't involved in that. Now,

18:54.649 --> 18:57.072
did... Did anybody ever, any student ever kind of 
spoof the marriage students because they weren't

18:58.807 --> 19:07.600
in the corps? Did anybody ever tease you or your 
husband about that? Well, since he had been in

19:13.048 --> 19:16.393
service, As a civilian, I think

19:16.694 --> 19:27.468
they respected those that had already served some 
time in the service and they left us alone pretty

19:16.694 --> 19:27.468
much. What did you as a newcomer think about the 
Corps? We just accepted it. The only thing that I

19:34.277 --> 19:39.664
can remember thinking that I really resented the 
most was that the uh... there were no women in the

19:39.998 --> 20:07.947
classes uh... there were a few women in summer 
classes and those were usually daughters of

19:39.998 --> 20:07.947
faculty members but there were so few there and 
many of them told us about some of the derogatory

19:39.998 --> 20:07.947
remarks that were made towards women and so you had 
to be pretty strong or you were intimidated to be in

19:39.998 --> 20:07.947
that class and that they didn't think it was a place 
for women and we felt We were as important as the

20:07.927 --> 20:10.111
men. Did any student ever get hurt with you that you 
remember? No.

20:22.553 --> 20:23.134
If they did, I tried to put that, block that out. I 
remember working on the first proposal for the

20:25.453 --> 20:32.080
name change for Texas A&M for Mr. Benson. I don't 
know whose idea. It started maybe within his

20:35.363 --> 20:47.034
department or he just happened to be working on it, 
but I remember the first time that I saw that there

20:35.363 --> 20:47.034
was a proposal to change the name to a university 
from Texas A&M. When was that? A&M College of Texas

20:48.295 --> 20:52.699
would have been sometime Well, it had to be before 
1960, because... Oh, so, really? Yes, so, you

20:56.253 --> 21:03.001
know, it was a proposal, it was just a, it was 
probably in a memo, but I remember typing it first.

21:03.021 --> 21:04.863
And what would the name have been, as far as you 
know? Texas A&M University. Oh, really? Yes. I

21:09.127 --> 21:10.449
wish I could find some of that. I've never, you just 
added something, I haven't heard about that.

21:13.652 --> 21:17.016
Well, it was either in minutes that he talked about 
it in a meeting, because it was something I typed

21:17.063 --> 21:21.289
and they were talking about a name change for Texas 
A&M. He talked about if he wanted it to be a

21:22.170 --> 21:36.811
university, not a college, and of course part of 
what he wanted was to see these graduate programs

21:22.170 --> 21:36.811
developed and that was within the goals of those, 
they were compatible goals, to see it become a

21:22.170 --> 21:36.811
university. All right, let me sidetrack for a 
second on that. Wayne Hall, who would later be vice

21:43.962 --> 22:03.623
president of academic affairs, said that in the 
early 60s, when yours truly was the author of the

21:43.962 --> 22:03.623
Aspirations Report, that of all the 
recommendations we made, he said the one that

21:43.962 --> 22:03.623
bugged Mr. Rutter the most, we recommend the name 
be changed to Texas State University. That's what

22:04.203 --> 22:05.625
they did in Oklahoma. That's what they had done in 
Mississippi. A whole bunch of A&Ms became state.

22:11.311 --> 22:12.552
And Mr. Rutter didn't want that. And that Wayne 
Hall said that he's the one that suggested A with no

22:13.223 --> 22:24.111
periods, an ampersand, don't spell it out A and D, M 
in order to be kind of like a logo. and that Mr.

22:25.318 --> 22:36.773
Rudder liked holding on to the A and M. I can't 
remember the exact name, and there was no

22:25.318 --> 22:36.773
discussion about the A not standing for anything, 
no period, and the ampersand. That was not part of

22:36.893 --> 22:38.235
the discussion. I do remember that. Because after 
we left here and the name was changed, I knew that

22:39.196 --> 22:44.864
there was not, I had not heard that before. But I 
just remember that the word university was used on

22:45.985 --> 22:51.212
the end of it, and they were discussing a name 
change. Do you remember where the proposal

22:51.192 --> 22:58.464
faltered, where it ended up? No, and I'm not sure I 
was here to know the end of the story, so to speak. At

23:03.112 --> 23:14.871
the time that you were working in the dean's 
office, the vice president for academic affairs,

23:03.112 --> 23:14.871
who did Benson report to?

23:19.610 --> 23:24.362
Morgan had been president, and then he's... Well, 
he would report it to Harrington, I believe. All

23:24.382 --> 23:25.525
right, and then Harrington. He reported to Dr. 
Harrington. I'm wondering if there was a vice

23:27.811 --> 23:29.997
president then. See, I don't know that there was. 
Did you have any action with Harrington? No. A lot

23:41.941 --> 23:45.904
of his work was sent out for us, but I really didn't 
have much interaction. He might call on the phone,

23:45.964 --> 23:51.429
but to really know him and to be in any kind of 
setting with him, I didn't know him. What did you

23:51.489 --> 23:54.672
working people think of him? We were just asked to 
do assignments, and we didn't really question

23:56.814 --> 24:00.017
those. So you didn't see him, really? Well, he'd 
come to see Mr. Benson occasionally, and Mr.

24:02.438 --> 24:08.672
Benson usually went to his office, though, most of 
the time he went there. And personality, how would

24:08.692 --> 24:12.159
you describe his personality in those years? I 
don't think I had an opinion, no. Did you all ever

24:14.685 --> 24:16.228
see Mrs. Harrington? No, I didn't know his 
heritage. We saw, we knew Mrs. Angel because we had

24:18.683 --> 24:33.125
some MSC programs, Bridge Club, and some of their 
wives were our teachers for, and it was free, of

24:18.683 --> 24:33.125
course. You could come to MSC and play bridge. 
While our husbands were studying, we'd come to

24:35.108 --> 24:52.165
campus and people like Mrs. Harrington and Mrs. 
Angel and Ms. Crawford and Mrs. Whiting would be

24:35.108 --> 24:52.165
the teachers and sponsors of the Bridge Club or 
some of the student organizations like Petroleum

24:35.108 --> 24:52.165
Engineering Wives Club. That was where a lot of our 
friendships were made. And did you learn to play

24:54.869 --> 24:56.972
bridge at that point? I played bridge, but I was 
never a really good bridge player. Is that where

25:00.117 --> 25:00.858
you learned? Yes. You hadn't played bridge 
before? No, no. What were the other student life

25:03.462 --> 25:10.473
activity opportunities other than the bridge? 
Just Petroleum Engineering Wives Club. That was

25:14.239 --> 25:15.781
pretty much our social life. Was there a once a 
month social event for student lives? We probably

25:23.641 --> 25:27.707
met as much as once a month, yes, but that's about 
it. Were you and your husband aware of a guy named

25:28.167 --> 25:30.751
Wayne Stark? Yes, I was, yes. I knew who he was 
because when I worked at the placement office, I

25:34.856 --> 25:41.646
knew who Wayne Stark was, yes. But we had little 
interaction with him. And did y'all ever see Bear

25:46.743 --> 25:51.248
Bryant? What was the impression you students had 
of Bear Bryant? Well, of course, if you loved

25:55.012 --> 25:58.857
football, you loved Bear Bryant. And I guess we 
expected football to be a tough sport, and it

25:59.678 --> 26:05.124
certainly was under Bear Bryant. He was really 
tough on his players. We knew that. Were there any

26:09.729 --> 26:13.333
athletes in classes with your husband? Yes, in 
business.

26:18.400 --> 26:21.683
His protege that went to Alabama with him. 
Stallings? Stallings was in Don's business

26:22.665 --> 26:26.689
classes with him at that time. Well, and Drake 
Keith. And Drake Keith. And I knew Bobby Drake

26:29.191 --> 26:30.493
Keith. He's from Breckenridge, Texas. Describe. 
Bobby Drake Keith. Yeah, yeah. And he and his wife

26:34.898 --> 26:37.700
lived in College View after he married. But he was a 
good football player in high school. And then, of

26:41.505 --> 26:45.769
course, he came and played football here and 
played under him. And I think he majored in... He

26:48.303 --> 26:51.087
was an engineer, but I can't remember whether he 
was in petroleum engineering. He was? Okay, so I

26:51.487 --> 26:55.893
believe he was the head of Don one year in class. 
Because he graduated in four years also. Yes, he

26:58.456 --> 26:59.036
did. And did you know Margaret, his wife? Yes, I 
did, and she was a teacher, if I'm correct. She was a

27:04.804 --> 27:05.645
music major. Okay, I couldn't remember what. 
Violin. Okay. They lived in College View? Yes,

27:09.910 --> 27:10.871
after they married. He came single, but he married 
Margaret, and they lived in College View, yes.

27:15.590 --> 27:20.700
Because one summer, he and Drake Keith were 
working on a rig near Monahans. And that was where

27:22.023 --> 27:24.007
her father was stationed. He worked for an oil 
company. And she was a Texas Tech music major. And

27:29.337 --> 27:32.383
that's where Drake and Margaret met. Because when 
he came back as assistant coach, he and Margaret

27:33.241 --> 27:37.929
were in the Sunday school class I taught. Is that 
right? That's right. He's just retired as head of

27:39.712 --> 27:42.837
what used to be Arkansas Power and Light. It's now 
Entergy Arkansas, but he's just retired. And in

27:48.747 --> 27:56.700
high school, he was really a loved student, really 
good student, well-liked, very popular. And when

27:57.288 --> 28:06.825
y'all were students, was there any rumor about 
some of the athletes getting easy courses,

27:57.288 --> 28:06.825
special grades? Were there any stories of that 
sort then? At A&M?

28:14.759 --> 28:19.568
I wasn't aware of it because I wasn't that involved 
with athletics. Were y'all aware of any student

28:19.588 --> 28:21.912
pranks? Oh, sure. We knew things like that took 
place. Do you remember any specific ones?

28:36.570 --> 28:39.774
None that I think I want to record.

28:40.955 --> 28:42.077
Okay, all right. See, now that line can go 
anywhere. Okay. None that I want to record. Did any

28:47.997 --> 28:58.192
students ever attempt any pranks or anything 
relating to the dean's office? No, Mr. Benson ran a

29:00.556 --> 29:04.181
pretty tough ship and I think they knew that. I 
don't think they were about to cross Mr. Benson. I

29:07.125 --> 29:10.410
would have been surprised if there was. Do you know 
of any important proposals that Benson sent

29:10.728 --> 29:19.751
forward that became fact? Some changes that were 
made during that? Did he get some of those doctoral

29:25.045 --> 29:27.150
programs going? Well, I don't know if they got 
completely implemented during that time. I do

29:31.172 --> 29:32.414
know they were proposed. And then the Center for 
Activation Analysis, the Nuclear Engineering

29:33.175 --> 29:39.823
Department was certainly strengthened. I'm not 
sure it was even a department at that time. And he

29:43.187 --> 29:46.712
brought in faculty to do those things. And then he 
got a research foundation going. And, of course,

29:49.355 --> 29:54.822
TEAS, the Texas Engineering Experiment Station, 
just exploded in years later. He worked with the

29:56.885 --> 30:01.852
Highway Department through TTI, of course, and a 
lot of those things have his blueprint on them.

30:02.753 --> 30:06.899
What did you all think his status on the campus was? 
How did he rank? Oh, he was the top administrator on

30:08.581 --> 30:10.564
campus. His word was good. Was engineering the 
largest then in enrollment? I suspect it was. I'm

30:20.366 --> 30:21.728
really not sure of that. We didn't have a school of 
business at that time. It was simply a program.

30:28.218 --> 30:33.246
Geology and geophysics were still under 
engineering, so there wasn't a College of

30:28.218 --> 30:33.246
Geoscience.

30:36.431 --> 30:37.973
Arts and Sciences were together. The College of 
Education was later. It was in A&S. Yes, it was in

30:43.081 --> 30:44.944
Arts and Sciences. And in the dean's meetings, Mr. 
Benson held his own, yes. As far as you know, how

30:51.334 --> 30:54.058
often did the deans meet? To my knowledge, they 
only met once or twice a month as a dean's group. And

31:00.167 --> 31:01.849
I'm not sure who the chair was. I assume it was Mr. 
Harrington, but I really don't know because I was

31:02.450 --> 31:08.839
not privy to those meetings and I didn't sit in 
them. Were you aware ever, at the working level,

31:09.646 --> 31:29.134
were you all aware of anybody ever trying from the 
outside to pull a string to a board member, a

31:09.646 --> 31:29.134
legislator, or anything like that, trying to 
manipulate anything? Well, no, I wouldn't.
