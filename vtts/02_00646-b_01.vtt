00:01.685 --> 00:02.646
I'm alert today. Go ahead. You don't want to 
stagger these five minutes this time? You don't

00:07.853 --> 00:09.455
want to stagger these five minutes? No. I don't 
want to go this time. Well, I'll just start at the

00:11.198 --> 00:14.983
same time. I'd like to begin today's interview 
actually with where the last interview ended. I

00:21.792 --> 00:25.136
want you to talk some more about crustaceans.

00:26.438 --> 00:30.443
What began your interest in them particularly? 
and where you are in terms of your research now with

00:30.828 --> 00:36.195
crustaceans. Last time you said that they 
intrigued you and that Gil Rowe at Woods Hole was

00:36.775 --> 00:47.368
involved in taking a look at them.

00:47.388 --> 00:50.812
Oh, no, you're getting me into hot water, but go 
ahead. When are you ready? I'm ready. All right.

00:57.841 --> 01:00.244
Well, the crustaceans are... interest to me 
because of the important role they play in the

01:00.443 --> 01:06.298
marine environment.

01:09.246 --> 01:14.801
Crustaceans predominate in the pelagic, in the 
water column. Perhaps some of the most Numerous

01:17.588 --> 01:33.532
organisms on Earth, metazoan-type organisms, 
are copepods, which are an important link in many

01:17.588 --> 01:33.532
of the so-called food webs of the ocean. And so I 
feel that for that kind of reason alone, however,

01:33.552 --> 01:47.292
my interests are in the bottom-dwelling forms, 
primarily bentonic forms. And I was particularly

01:47.828 --> 02:05.533
stimulated because of the fact that the 
brachiorhyns, or the true crabs, tend to be

01:47.828 --> 02:05.533
shallow water forms. They are very predominant in 
the shallow water on the continental shelf and

02:05.573 --> 02:11.541
become... far less numerous but equally 
interesting in the deep water. As a matter of fact,

02:17.924 --> 02:33.601
also, one of the largest of the crabs, of the true 
crabs, the giant red crab, as it's called,

02:17.924 --> 02:33.601
attracted my attention as a possible source of 
food. I make the distinction of true crab because

02:34.822 --> 02:42.270
the Alaska king crab, for example, is not a true 
crab. It is a hermit crab type. And we have a large

02:46.240 --> 02:54.008
representative of that group in the Gulf of Mexico 
as well. But this giant red crab is a true brack

02:54.108 --> 02:58.012
urine crab.

03:01.716 --> 03:11.025
Now, in addition to that, I found some crabs in the 
bottom of the Gulf, which is, of course, around

03:01.716 --> 03:11.025
12,000 feet.

03:12.457 --> 03:16.501
which are very poorly known. As a matter of fact, 
one of them is represented by, so far as I'm aware,

03:16.601 --> 03:25.230
only three specimens in the world. And I have taken 
two of those three. And as a consequence, with all

03:30.014 --> 03:40.725
the work I've done in the bottom of the Gulf, and 
since this is the only place that I've found it,

03:41.768 --> 03:52.006
Of course, extremely curious as to how some of 
these forms are able to reproduce and to sustain

03:41.768 --> 03:52.006
the small populations they have. It would be 
intriguing to think they live for long, long

03:53.529 --> 04:02.786
periods of time and that they're electoral, but on 
the other hand, I doubt that very much. But

04:02.846 --> 04:06.392
nevertheless, the crabs are an interesting 
group. Then, furthermore, another intriguing

04:06.575 --> 04:34.185
sort of thing is that the giant isopod, which is a 
crustacean group as well, which lives in the Gulf

04:06.575 --> 04:34.185
and the Caribbean, the largest isopod known, 
which measures up to around 12, 14 inches in length

04:06.575 --> 04:34.185
and about 4 1⁄2 to 5 inches wide, is, again, I think, 
a possible source of... of food of a particular

04:34.604 --> 04:36.647
type. And I was intrigued by the fact that I 
discovered that these things swim. I think I

04:43.518 --> 04:46.603
mentioned this in a previous interview, but I'm 
not sure. Most unlikely heavy-bodied creatures,

04:46.643 --> 04:54.736
swimmers, but apparently they do. As a matter of 
fact, I know they do because I've taken movies of

04:54.797 --> 05:01.928
them in around 5,000 feet of water.

05:04.962 --> 05:19.185
In addition to that, my wife and I have teamed up to 
describe a number of new species among a very

05:04.962 --> 05:19.185
fascinating group of crustaceans known as 
Galatheids. These are a rather strange group

05:19.626 --> 05:28.360
related to hermit crabs. They look very much like 
miniature lobsters. And we've found these, as I

05:32.080 --> 05:42.113
believe I've mentioned previously, in all depths 
of the sea. But the intriguing thing about them is

05:42.213 --> 05:54.549
that they sort out as to generic or taxonomic type 
very nicely. There being a group belonging to a

05:54.589 --> 05:59.235
genus Munida, which exists primarily, almost 
exclusively, in shelf and shallow upper

05:59.468 --> 06:13.160
continental slope waters, whereas the group 
Munidopsis tends to go into much deeper water. And

06:13.660 --> 06:22.908
we find some very nice ecological separations of 
these forms and some very nice and interesting

06:13.660 --> 06:22.908
geographic distributions. Here again, forms 
that are not terribly well known.

06:30.552 --> 06:49.816
And then, of course, I was intrigued by that group 
that are so enigmatic, the polychelids, which are

06:30.552 --> 06:49.816
forms that we know next to nothing about. As I have 
remarked repeatedly to students, I have no a

06:57.383 --> 07:14.870
reason for understanding why we've never been 
able to photograph these things in our bottom

06:57.383 --> 07:14.870
photography or our movies, whereas most other 
groups are well represented in our photographic

06:57.383 --> 07:14.870
collection of deep sea organisms. We know they're 
on the surface because we troll them, but we can't

07:16.552 --> 07:26.327
figure out unless they're extremely fast, which 
is possible, in their movements, why we have not

07:27.016 --> 07:32.862
been able to obtain pictures of them. And there are 
a lot of other things about them that are

07:33.823 --> 07:35.925
interesting. I had a student, Dick Firth, who 
studied them for some years, and he couldn't

07:35.965 --> 07:46.397
figure out either why we didn't photograph them.

07:48.419 --> 07:52.483
Now, I'm sure I've left some things out, but the 
crustaceans are fascinating group of organisms.

07:54.452 --> 07:59.380
They serve the sea as the insects serve on land. As 
you know, there are very few insects in the sea,

08:00.281 --> 08:05.309
extremely small number. We've got one out there, a 
bug, Halobates micans, that runs around on the

08:05.370 --> 08:12.080
surface of the sea. But it's cosmopolitan or 
rather widely distributed species. Other than

08:20.189 --> 08:23.813
that, there are very few insects in the marine 
environment. Could you tell us a little bit about

08:25.034 --> 08:32.561
your work in underwater photography, these 
movies and photographic surveys you've done?

08:32.581 --> 08:32.982
Yes.

08:37.206 --> 08:48.998
I first got into bottom photography as a result of 
dredging some

08:37.206 --> 08:48.998
iron-rich sediments, indurated sediments, 
consolidated sediments in the eastern Gulf of

08:49.366 --> 08:55.955
Mexico. The thing that intrigued me, in addition 
to the fact that it's very high in iron content, was

08:55.995 --> 09:12.158
that there were some organisms living on the bits 
of iron stone. And since rock is at a premium in the

09:12.258 --> 09:17.365
Gulf of Mexico, exposed rock, I returned there 
rather repeatedly. And what I wanted to do was

09:24.183 --> 09:31.653
prove two things. One, that this was truly rock and 
was not something that had been dropped from old

09:31.994 --> 09:46.153
sailing vessels as ballast rock, but that it was in 
situ and formed there in this very remote section,

09:46.758 --> 09:51.804
the center section of the eastern Gulf of Mexico. 
And so I obtained a small bottom camera and began

09:53.286 --> 10:01.396
taking pictures. I had surmised also, because of 
the nature of the organisms on this ironstone,

10:01.956 --> 10:14.892
that there had to be a current flowing at the bottom 
there, and yet There were, at that time, there were

10:15.344 --> 10:20.590
very few records of deep bottom currents. Now the 
depth here was on the order of 10,000, 10,000 to

10:20.650 --> 10:27.057
11,000 feet, so that's fairly deep water. There 
was no theoretical rationale in physical

10:28.559 --> 10:38.590
oceanography to explain this current, nor is it 
adequately explained right now. I've got some

10:39.251 --> 10:40.592
ideas. But I'm not certain about it. I think the 
current may be related, actually, to the

10:42.754 --> 10:51.527
intensity of trade winds. But that's gotten far 
afield at the moment. At any rate, I got the

10:55.533 --> 11:11.035
photographs of the Ironstone after a lot of tries 
and then got very definite evidence of a bottom

10:55.533 --> 11:11.035
current. And so although I'm a biologically 
inclined individual, I did publish a paper on the

11:11.740 --> 11:40.684
ironstone with some colleagues, and also on this 
bottom current, which was among the few bottom

11:11.740 --> 11:40.684
currents of any consequence that had been 
reported on at that time. I became then intrigued

11:41.305 --> 11:56.980
because of the stills that I was getting of certain 
animals with the potential of using movies

11:41.305 --> 11:56.980
underwater in very deep water. And 
unfortunately, I have such a backlog of work that I

11:57.180 --> 12:10.232
have not explored that properly and don't know 
whether I'll have enough years left to do it. It is a

12:10.651 --> 12:12.414
very intriguing thing. I

12:12.634 --> 12:32.245
ran into some problems of wanting to use a rather 
large Aeroflex camera with a large film reel and

12:12.634 --> 12:32.245
getting an underwater case to house it. None was 
available on the market, so we had to fabricate our

12:33.366 --> 12:38.194
own. cast around for months trying to find some 
suitable material large enough that would

12:38.596 --> 12:46.926
withstand the pressure. And I thought, of course, 
it had to be aluminum. I finally found that there

12:51.311 --> 13:01.342
was an extrusion plant that extruded tubing with a 
16-inch ID and perhaps thick enough to work. And

13:01.442 --> 13:06.628
the guy that I talked to was intrigued enough by it 
to say, well, you could probably supply it to me for

13:07.351 --> 13:13.799
$300 or $400, enough to do the job. This was an Air 
Force piece of equipment and was housed in a

13:14.800 --> 13:22.429
commercial plant. Well, I thought everything was 
going to be go, and yet when I got down to cases with

13:22.449 --> 13:35.265
the actual company where the thing was, I found 
out, yeah, it probably would be $300 for the first

13:22.449 --> 13:35.265
two feet of it, But it would cost me $16,000 for a 
startup fee. So I went into that trouble. Finally,

13:44.455 --> 13:48.160
we made one out of laminated. We took a three-inch 
aluminum flat plate, cut it, and stacked it like

13:49.101 --> 14:00.136
so, and machined out the opening we wanted. And 
then we had to put O-rings. So we've got a stacked

14:01.958 --> 14:05.843
case of about eight different or layers of this 
stuff. And then we put in the port in the front. It

14:14.117 --> 14:21.348
worked beautifully, except that it was necessary 
to anchor the ship. And to anchor the ship in deep

14:21.368 --> 14:27.317
water takes some doing in the first place. But I've 
done it. But I must say that There has been a marked

14:33.245 --> 14:40.875
change in the weather in the Gulf of Mexico in the 
last five years. It is getting worse, and I believe

14:41.116 --> 14:45.181
it is a trend. Just a personal belief that the wind 
fields are intensifying, and we have much more

14:46.283 --> 14:56.657
wind and rougher seas than we had in the 60s. And 
therefore, it was hard for me to hold the ship at

14:57.898 --> 15:01.243
anchor And thus I lost a lot of ship time. And it 
would really require to do a beautiful job of

15:05.321 --> 15:11.828
underwater movies, which I wanted to do. I had it 
all set to leave it on the bottom. It

15:15.351 --> 15:22.919
would take a lot of ship time and a separate 
proposal of the National Science Foundation. And

15:22.979 --> 15:25.482
right now I have just too many other things to do. 
And maybe in my closing couple of years or so I'm

15:25.522 --> 15:30.287
going to try it. I don't know. Now, would you just 
leave this camera floating free down there? No, it

15:34.925 --> 15:45.681
would be on a tripod, and I had it programmed so that 
it was on 15 seconds out of every 5 minutes, and I

15:34.925 --> 15:45.681
could leave it down for 36 hours. And I would have to 
take a chance, is what I would find. But what I was

15:52.190 --> 15:56.897
doing... was and i got some pretty good stuff 
actually in the short time that i did use it was

15:57.097 --> 16:25.602
selecting the places where my trawling told me the 
organisms i would like to photograph were

15:57.097 --> 16:25.602
actually present now obviously we have to go 
through this metal calibration because whenever

15:57.097 --> 16:25.602
you drag a net through the water for plankton or 
whatever you drag a trawl on the bottom for bottom

15:57.097 --> 16:25.602
organisms You always bring up the accumulated 
mass, which is, of course, spaced out here. And

16:34.493 --> 16:43.924
what you hope is that your mean free path is not so 
disadvantageous to you that you miss most of the

16:34.493 --> 16:43.924
organisms. But they obviously, in many 
instances, are scattered out. And it's like a

16:47.829 --> 16:52.334
cloud chamber, or it's like a collision of 
molecules. You may or you may not. And what we

16:56.378 --> 17:02.145
deduce from what we get may be rather far from the 
truth. But there's one thing I'm certain of, is

17:02.185 --> 17:07.992
that organisms are widely scattered in the bottom 
of the ocean. And I'm pretty lucky to get in. So I

17:10.254 --> 17:11.556
also baited it. Now, this man, John Isaacs, has 
done some magnificent and fascinating work with

17:12.036 --> 17:23.770
bottom photography with a monster camera, which 
he uses an entirely different technique, and his

17:24.053 --> 17:32.562
colleague out there, one of them, Hessler, Robert 
Hessler, has used it to advantage also. They put a

17:33.003 --> 17:42.954
big five-gallon can loaded with rotten fish down, 
and then they've got the camera held aloft, and

17:33.003 --> 17:42.954
they just drop it. Bang. And then it's got a 
time-release magnesium bar, and that magnesium

17:43.494 --> 17:53.385
bar goes into solution, and after so many hours, 
the bar breaks loose in it. The thing comes back to

17:53.855 --> 17:59.342
the surface, and I guess they've got radio stuff on 
it. I don't know. But at any rate, they attract

17:59.703 --> 18:05.510
organisms in, and it's fascinating to see those 
things come in. Of course, it's time-lapse, so

18:05.651 --> 18:08.554
you've got a shot. You can see these organisms come 
creeping in. And you can see things sometimes

18:12.920 --> 18:20.470
swimming by, sedately moving crustaceans and So 
if you do manage to get in touch with this man and get

18:21.479 --> 18:32.854
some kind of appointment, you must interrogate 
him about his monster camera because it's really

18:21.479 --> 18:32.854
very interesting. Do you see the biggest 
potential in this being the observation of

18:33.615 --> 18:42.567
behavior or more qualitative sampling of what is 
there? Well, we know both,

18:43.689 --> 18:49.917
obviously. important things. As far as we're 
concerned, we know so little about the deep ocean

18:52.105 --> 19:05.303
and its biota, biota in the sense of bacteria being 
plants, because there isn't much else down there

18:52.105 --> 19:05.303
in that plant life, maybe some fungi. But at any 
rate, these

19:07.246 --> 19:17.760
things are so poorly known, and we know so little 
about the effects of pressure We know so little

19:18.348 --> 19:22.232
about what controls the distribution of these 
organisms. Well, we can surmise that food is

19:22.352 --> 19:26.736
important, but I'm talking about vertical 
distribution. And although years ago pressure

19:26.876 --> 19:33.103
was ruled out as being significant, I'm quite sure 
that it is significant. And I think that these

19:34.224 --> 19:43.613
kinds of things, photographic probes,

19:45.061 --> 19:49.808
depicting the organism while we are testing them 
in other ways. For example, using caged organisms

19:50.328 --> 20:08.114
with the camera in the cage could give us a great 
deal of information on behavior upon the

19:50.328 --> 20:08.114
susceptibility of the organism to various 
pressure effects and so on. In addition, we

20:08.574 --> 20:14.663
probably can get some idea of how far away these 
organisms can be attracted by scent, so to speak,

20:14.879 --> 20:30.596
by putting these baits down and having more than 
one camera to get an idea of where they are coming in

20:14.879 --> 20:30.596
from and how far out and so on and so on. So, yeah, I 
think there's great potential. It's very

20:33.580 --> 20:35.462
intriguing. It's just another mode for man to 
satisfy his curiosity, I think. You gentlemen,

20:41.761 --> 20:53.919
I'm sure, are aware of the importance of that to the 
welfare of all people, whether they be

20:41.761 --> 20:53.919
politicians or biologists, which are the same. 
We're all biologists, biologically inclined.

20:58.846 --> 21:00.729
Those are some of my photographs, too. Yes, I was 
noticing those. That's part of the reason I was

21:02.312 --> 21:05.997
asking about the photographs.

21:08.390 --> 21:18.880
I'm interested, too, and do you think there's a 
permanent wind change in the, by permanent, I mean

21:08.390 --> 21:18.880
the next several years or so in the Gulf? Well, now, 
I'm not an authority at all on that, but I would say

21:18.900 --> 21:38.177
this, that Reed Bryson at Wisconsin, a 
meteorologist who is controversial,

21:18.900 --> 21:38.177
has made some worldwide studies of climatic 
change. And indeed, he issued a report for the CIA,

21:48.003 --> 22:07.945
which you probably have recently seen, because of 
the potential impact of weather change phenomena

21:48.003 --> 22:07.945
on food supplies, and thus the possibility of 
world upheaval as famine began to strike. I think

22:11.511 --> 22:23.407
this is a real danger, that famine will trigger 
riots and uprisings that will be extremely

22:11.511 --> 22:23.407
serious. Well, at any rate, some years back when 
the debate was going on among meteorologists, I

22:23.447 --> 22:35.383
followed some of it in the literature. And at the 
same time, I was experiencing great changes in the

22:36.241 --> 22:41.548
climate of the Gulf. Now, the changes that he's 
predicting are long-range changes. And so I do not

22:48.517 --> 22:51.220
think that it's a minor perturbation. I think, 
yes, it is important and a phase change. It's

22:57.268 --> 22:58.109
possible. Who knows? I don't. But it wouldn't take 
a lot to convince me that we are moving possibly

23:05.333 --> 23:08.419
into another glacial period. So I don't have any 
evidence for it. I don't against it. But at any

23:14.190 --> 23:21.064
rate,

23:14.190 --> 23:21.064
conjecture indicates it would be a darn good 
possibility.
