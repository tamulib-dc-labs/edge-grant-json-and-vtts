WEBVTT

00:02.326 --> 00:10.386
The idea was that I ought to have some input to the person that's going to write their annual evaluation.

00:11.388 --> 00:16.521
And I called each of the services and I did quickly get approval for them.

00:16.990 --> 00:23.939
from each service for me to make a written input that the rater could use or not use.

00:23.959 --> 00:28.064
But it's something we used to do, a letter of evaluation in the Air Force.

00:28.645 --> 00:38.037
If you weren't entitled to a full evaluation, you went over and worked for a person for six weeks or two months and did a special job, it didn't qualify for a full rating.

00:38.017 --> 00:41.723
But it would qualify for one of these letters of evaluation.

00:42.084 --> 00:43.546
So it would go into the file.

00:43.967 --> 00:47.392
So it gave me a little bit of leverage there.

00:48.975 --> 00:50.818
And leverage may not be the right word.

00:50.958 --> 00:51.439
Influence.

00:52.341 --> 00:57.970
But it was a situation that's still troublesome, I believe, today.

00:58.010 --> 01:00.514
As you arrived...

01:01.135 --> 01:09.348
as far as you were aware at that time, describe the Corps of Cadets, the number, the quality, the variety, and so forth.

01:10.229 --> 01:14.616
When I arrived in 87, the recruiting had essentially been done for the year.

01:15.157 --> 01:18.723
That was the last year of enrollment management, as I recall, at A&M.

01:18.743 --> 01:22.789
We had the largest fish class in the United States

01:22.769 --> 01:24.232
Texas A&M did.

01:24.352 --> 01:31.846
I remember freshman students going around with these t-shirts on the largest fish class in the nation or something to that effect.

01:32.267 --> 01:35.392
I think we had about 8,800 freshmen that fall.

01:35.412 --> 01:40.041
The Corps benefited from that large freshman enrollment.

01:40.061 --> 01:45.030
And our total enrollment was between 23 and 2400 that fall.

01:45.010 --> 01:47.795
I believe it has not been that large since then.

01:47.875 --> 01:53.044
We came close on one or two years, but it has not been that large since 1987.

01:53.304 --> 02:05.145
Of course, enrollment management has changed things up there and limited the freshman enrollment somewhat lower than what we knew then.

02:06.070 --> 02:16.470
I met a lot of freshmen that fall, you know, just going around trying to get to know some of them, observing them, and I'd always ask each one I met, well, you know, what are you going to study?

02:16.510 --> 02:18.213
Well, I'm an aeronautical engineer.

02:19.095 --> 02:24.585
And I couldn't believe how many people told me they were engineers, and particularly aeronautical engineers.

02:25.578 --> 02:31.609
Later, I discovered that about 50% of the freshman class in the Corps were engineers.

02:32.250 --> 02:35.917
And it had been that way for a while, predominantly engineering.

02:37.419 --> 02:47.738
A lot of them changed and dropped out of engineering, you know, within a year or two, but still a pretty high percent of engineers.

02:50.317 --> 02:55.783
The kids came from all across, again, but it seemed like a lot more from the bigger cities.

02:57.505 --> 03:00.209
Certain feeder schools seemed to be predominant.

03:00.629 --> 03:03.633
Plano area was one that stuck out, I thought.

03:06.456 --> 03:07.777
What about women and minorities?

03:08.378 --> 03:13.704
We had a small number of women in the Corps.

03:13.825 --> 03:19.311
I'm going to estimate 60 total, something like 50, 60 at the most.

03:19.831 --> 03:26.099
minorities, a few African-Americans, a good many Hispanics.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.943
Later on I started tracking all this.

03:28.963 --> 03:31.326
There was no tracking mechanism on that.

03:31.807 --> 03:40.618
No one asked me a thing about that or said anything, but it was not till later that we really got interested in those numbers.

03:43.522 --> 03:48.268
The cadets seemed pretty

03:49.615 --> 03:58.448
high-spirited students, enjoyed the fun and games, and I was impressed especially by some of the commanders.

04:01.232 --> 04:07.742
Did you think these students compared well with what you thought you and your buddies were 30 years earlier?

04:08.549 --> 04:09.290
Oh, I think so.

04:09.570 --> 04:17.962
I think in a lot of ways I thought they were better qualified than what I remembered we were back in my days.

04:19.164 --> 04:22.268
But they were good students, but there were some of them that struggled.

04:23.269 --> 04:28.156
Some of them came in with pretty low SATs and not the greatest records.

04:29.117 --> 04:33.223
Some of those struggled, but I saw cases where some of those people did very well too.

04:33.575 --> 04:40.884
I think shows that, you know, it depends on your effort and some other things sometimes, not just your SAT.

04:41.444 --> 04:53.078
As a new CO, commanding officer, I'm assuming that you had, at least privately, that you had a strategy plan.

04:53.979 --> 04:59.245
What was your plan for your role as Commandant?

05:01.570 --> 05:03.312
Let me back up a little bit again.

05:03.332 --> 05:11.142
In our discussion for coming here and right as I came, a lot of interest on hazing.

05:11.162 --> 05:17.550
In fact, the local Brian paper had contacted me at Norfolk and wanted to know what I thought about the new state hazing law.

05:18.531 --> 05:21.014
How was I going to implement that and on and on.

05:22.236 --> 05:24.639
And I didn't know what the situation was.

05:24.739 --> 05:25.880
I hadn't seen this.

05:25.940 --> 05:27.983
They just told me about it.

05:28.486 --> 05:33.315
You know, the degree of hazing and problems we had in the Corps, I didn't know.

05:33.335 --> 05:34.758
I didn't have that background.

05:35.239 --> 05:37.343
So that leads me into what I'm about to say.

05:37.423 --> 05:42.253
My initial strategy was to do a lot of listening and watching.

05:43.174 --> 05:49.667
And John Colas had kind of told me, why don't you take about a year and size things up?

05:50.120 --> 05:51.603
see what you think of all this.

05:52.224 --> 05:54.548
You know, change is not easy.

05:54.588 --> 06:02.062
And, you know, we want you to come in and do an evaluation of everything and then you start doing the things.

06:02.744 --> 06:13.123
So my first year was pretty much to follow the party line, listen to my staff, do the things, let them introduce me to all of these things.

06:13.103 --> 06:21.595
I would try to get to know the students and see what's going on, and then we'll go from there.

06:21.655 --> 06:33.332
But my first year was pretty much to continue what was in place, but to start thinking about what new direction I wanted to bring to the Corps.

06:33.352 --> 06:43.026
And you're inferring then that there were no fires that had to be put out immediately, no immediate crises.

06:43.597 --> 06:46.803
That they told you you had to deal with on day one.

06:47.585 --> 06:53.878
The only thing that really was sort of put to me was this hazing law.

06:53.898 --> 06:59.229
You know, you're going to have to figure out what this thing means and what do we do about it.

06:59.249 --> 07:02.415
You know, that was something that I had to deal with.

07:02.986 --> 07:11.778
There was another thing that happened shortly after, well, two or three things happened shortly after I came here.

07:13.160 --> 07:16.104
One, I learned about a previous bonfire incident.

07:16.424 --> 07:29.061
Malin and his briefing of me, he took about 10 days to brief me on a bunch of things and what was going on and what they'd been involved in, the major problems as he saw them.

07:29.041 --> 07:30.787
women working at the bonfire.

07:30.867 --> 07:34.299
They had this incident the previous year that he dealt with all year.

07:34.379 --> 07:37.650
This one female cadet was up on a barrel

07:38.744 --> 07:56.242
playing the scarecrow or something, and some of the guys thought she's not supposed to be there, and it resulted in an incident and an investigation that had been a burr on his back all year, I believe, and that was just being settled when I came here, but they told me about it.

07:56.262 --> 08:07.553
Well, within two weeks or so after I moved into the Commandant's seat there, I started getting calls from alumni and prominent people,

08:08.427 --> 08:11.150
telling me that the discipline system was a mess.

08:12.352 --> 08:22.805
That these four cadets, I believe, were being expelled from school because of a simple little prank, birthday prank.

08:24.407 --> 08:27.851
And that, you know, what am I going to do about that?

08:27.971 --> 08:30.715
I need to get in involved and get this straightened out.

08:31.316 --> 08:33.478
I said, I don't even know what incident you're talking about.

08:33.538 --> 08:34.840
It's all new to me.

08:35.495 --> 08:50.033
Well, it was a yell leader and I think three of his buddies, the yell leader, senior yell leader-to-be, they were living over in the quad area during the summer and it was his birthday and they had quatted him.

08:50.895 --> 08:52.677
That term was a new one to me.

08:52.697 --> 08:53.818
I didn't know what they were talking about.

08:53.838 --> 09:04.692
I don't ever heard of quadding in my day, but apparently they stick his head in a commode and flush it, stick the top of his head down in there some way.

09:05.279 --> 09:14.248
Another time it's used is when people drop water bombs out of windows on people's heads and stuff like that.

09:14.348 --> 09:18.873
But it was some kind of quadding that he was involved in.

09:18.973 --> 09:27.942
And in accordance with the new hazing law, they had been, as I recall, expelled or suspended from school.

09:29.383 --> 09:34.408
And the alumni that were calling me were irate that

09:34.608 --> 09:43.217
they would have been dismissed for a traditional corps prank and demanded that I get myself involved.

09:43.717 --> 09:45.619
It really wasn't in my jurisdiction.

09:46.220 --> 09:48.602
Because it was summer school, the corps wasn't in session.

09:48.662 --> 09:54.488
It was handled by Dr. Brent Patterson's group over in Student Services.

09:55.489 --> 09:58.492
And they made the call there, as I recall.

09:58.852 --> 10:01.695
And I think it was

10:02.418 --> 10:06.804
their sense of the new hazing law that any little thing like that would not be tolerated.

10:08.466 --> 10:13.212
So we did have that to deal with, but again, I didn't deal with it directly.

10:15.955 --> 10:21.942
It wasn't under my jurisdiction, but people were coming to me and saying, you know, you need to be involved.

10:21.963 --> 10:26.188
Who are these folks over here making these decisions about a cadet?

10:26.488 --> 10:27.710
You're the commandant.

10:28.391 --> 10:30.673
You know, you ought to be responsible for this.

10:30.713 --> 10:31.935
You're around.

10:32.455 --> 10:38.485
I started opening my eyes to all this stuff saying, hey, this is not what I came here expecting.

10:39.707 --> 10:55.112
Another little associated comment, that August graduation and commissioning ceremony, General Ormond Simpson gave the little commissioning speech that day and commissioned the people since I was so brand new.

10:55.713 --> 10:59.239
But Ormond stood there in his white uniform and all did a great job.

10:59.894 --> 11:05.160
As you recall, they have those little luncheons after graduation, especially on Friday night and Saturday noon.

11:05.220 --> 11:10.385
My wife and I were invited to the luncheon, and we're sitting there.

11:10.405 --> 11:12.227
We have assigned seats.

11:13.088 --> 11:16.171
And they say, oh, General and Mrs. Darley, you all sit right here.

11:17.513 --> 11:25.581
I didn't know who most of these people were, but it turned out Royce Weisenbaker was on one side of me, and Joe Reynolds was on the other side.

11:26.641 --> 11:29.303
And we had quite a conversation during lunch.

11:29.664 --> 11:31.746
And they were both regents at that point.

11:31.766 --> 11:32.226
Both regents.

11:33.247 --> 11:36.490
I'd heard about them, but I don't think I'd met either one of them.

11:37.631 --> 11:40.313
Didn't know a great deal about them other than that they were regents.

11:40.354 --> 11:42.395
And I knew Mr. Weisenbaker was an oil man.

11:43.196 --> 11:44.057
Reynolds was a lawyer.

11:44.798 --> 11:47.500
But we had a nice conversation.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.522
Reynolds told me that he was from Baylor, I believe.

11:49.542 --> 11:52.004
He was really a Baylor grad, but he had a great love for A&M.

11:52.144 --> 11:54.066
He'd been in Marine Corps and all that.

11:54.417 --> 12:03.694
But it didn't take us long before they kind of zeroed in on me to tell me, you're here to be in charge of discipline for the court.

12:04.075 --> 12:07.160
We want you to be in charge.

12:07.781 --> 12:09.605
Don't let anybody tell you you're not.

12:12.330 --> 12:15.295
Well, I couldn't believe

12:15.359 --> 12:18.843
that I had received such a direct charge from them.

12:19.564 --> 12:22.287
But I knew that, you know, there are regents over here.

12:22.327 --> 12:25.291
They're not here in the operating mode every day.

12:25.431 --> 12:32.560
So you know what they're telling me, how does that translate into directions from John Koldis or President Vandiver?

12:33.060 --> 12:34.602
So I was a little troubled by all that.

12:36.084 --> 12:39.628
I did talk to John some about that.

12:40.773 --> 12:50.868
And we considered that off and on for a year, and eventually he did send me a little short paragraph saying I was in charge of this one for the Corps.

12:52.851 --> 12:54.313
But that didn't last too long.

12:55.434 --> 12:58.639
Administrations changed, and it's in there somewhere.

12:58.739 --> 13:01.103
I forget exactly when this happened.

13:01.123 --> 13:08.333
But within a year or so after I came here, I was given full authority over the Corps to expel, dismiss, and all of that.

13:09.224 --> 13:18.698
I told John that if you're going to give me that authority, I think there needs to be some appeal system where students can appeal to some other authority.

13:18.718 --> 13:20.982
And that was part of the system, as I recall.

13:22.123 --> 13:27.992
We operated that way for a little while, but there were a lot of folks on campus

13:28.192 --> 13:32.779
started saying, hey, this is not right, you know, you need to treat all these.

13:32.799 --> 13:34.041
Well, we had some problems.

13:34.141 --> 13:44.698
Jackie Sherrill had some problems with athletes before then where they were kind of handled over on the side and some feeling that they got special treatment.

13:45.590 --> 13:51.937
RC had taken over and he'd given disciplinary authority back to the university in a sense.

13:52.838 --> 13:59.026
And John explained to me that, you know, I think really the Corps ought to be just like everybody else.

13:59.086 --> 14:00.988
We have the same disciplinary system.

14:02.550 --> 14:08.897
But back to Mr. Wisebaker and Joe Reynolds talking to me, they assisted the military's different

14:09.232 --> 14:14.642
You need somebody with military background who can understand all this to make all these decisions.

14:16.706 --> 14:25.543
But anyway, it was a great controversy and… Did they infer they were speaking for the board or were they speaking for themselves as individuals?

14:25.664 --> 14:31.054
It wasn't clear, but I gathered that it was a consensus of the board.

14:31.034 --> 14:36.582
Obviously, they had talked some about a commandant coming and all of that.

14:36.662 --> 14:42.231
I don't know if they were in the approval process or not, but they seemed very interested in all of this.

14:43.072 --> 14:47.739
And let me know, you know, they were supportive of the Corps.

14:47.819 --> 14:49.341
We wanted to be strong.

14:49.461 --> 14:51.645
You know, it's the backbone of the university.

14:52.386 --> 14:57.193
You know, this is a bold step for the university now to bring in its own commandant.

14:57.747 --> 15:02.474
and have a general officer here, and you're it, and you're in charge.

15:02.494 --> 15:16.353
They were very supportive, and Doug DeCluet was one of those regents, and Doug headed this committee, a subcommittee of the regents that was to provide some oversight support for the Corps, interest in the Corps.

15:16.994 --> 15:26.387
They were to have, that was in their area of purview, I guess, and Doug met me shortly after that and told me that he wanted me to come to the

15:26.772 --> 15:33.426
Regents meetings, and he periodically asked me to make a report to the Regents.

15:33.446 --> 15:35.671
And he did.

15:35.691 --> 15:40.140
And I could, from the first time I went there, I could tell

15:40.272 --> 15:46.742
To a person, they were very supportive and wanted the court to prosper and do well, very interested.

15:47.744 --> 15:51.790
They wanted the court to have what it needed.

15:51.810 --> 16:01.065
They wanted me to make the changes that needed to be made, but on the other hand, I'm sure they wouldn't have suggested some things that I might have in mind.

16:01.687 --> 16:12.158
Were there other regents and or President Vandiver or other former students that gave you advice early on, either solicited or unsolicited advice?

16:16.562 --> 16:17.923
Well, there were other regents.

16:18.023 --> 16:20.246
I used to know those all very well.

16:20.306 --> 16:22.288
John Mobley was one of them from Austin.

16:23.329 --> 16:25.711
Lowry Mays, very supportive.

16:27.893 --> 16:31.457
Early on, did you get any calls?

16:31.994 --> 16:46.030
say at home or middle of the night or suddenly where some regent or some former student called to try to give you advice or to ask for special help to a certain student?

16:47.192 --> 16:48.173
I got a lot of those.

16:50.155 --> 17:00.567
Some of them I wouldn't name probably at this point, but on the other hand, I don't know that there's any that I couldn't name that I can recall.

17:01.424 --> 17:14.621
Back up a little bit, something we were talking about a moment ago on this discipline with those kids that were involved with the quieting.

17:18.025 --> 17:29.119
There were some parents that led an effort to change my position, my reporting responsibility, directly to the president.

17:29.892 --> 17:35.217
They were very, this discipline, the handling of that case is what started this.

17:36.498 --> 17:40.062
And there's a fellow from over around Austin started calling me.

17:40.102 --> 17:40.903
I didn't know him.

17:41.623 --> 17:42.804
Had a son in the Corps.

17:44.386 --> 17:58.920
And he felt it was all wrong for me to be reporting to student services, that my responsibility was such that

17:59.373 --> 18:01.078
You need to be under the president.

18:02.101 --> 18:11.627
You know, the Corps is not going to get the resources it needs and all, and you're not going to have the authority and control that you need unless you report directly to the president.

18:11.995 --> 18:13.797
I really felt uncomfortable with that.

18:14.919 --> 18:16.601
And he got others backing it.

18:17.021 --> 18:26.173
In fact, one of the football games, they were passing out flyers to the crowd coming in to support this idea that the commandant should report to the president.

18:28.155 --> 18:30.639
Well, I didn't know what to do about all that.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.063
I did talk to John a little bit.

18:34.183 --> 18:40.551
He'd heard a little about it, and he wasn't pleased with that at all, and I can understand.

18:41.189 --> 18:46.234
And did they understand that you had no part in encouraging this?

18:46.795 --> 18:48.617
They knew that that was their idea.

18:48.797 --> 18:53.202
But, you know, they'd call me up and say, this is the way it ought to be.

18:53.462 --> 18:56.606
I was mostly in the listening mode at that time.

18:56.706 --> 19:00.990
I didn't know the impact of all of this and didn't have it all figured out.

19:01.050 --> 19:07.898
I thought, well, in some ways that might be nice, but I can't believe the president, you know, is looking for someone else to report on him.

19:07.938 --> 19:08.698
How would it work?

19:09.139 --> 19:11.061
And I thought a lot about that.

19:11.480 --> 19:12.091
uh...

19:13.235 --> 19:16.638
Where does the commandant, to whom does he report?

19:17.459 --> 19:23.304
And early on I detected that we were quite different to all the other departments in Student Services.

19:24.165 --> 19:37.237
We were kind of a daily operating command versus a planning group or some of the departments don't have the daily hectic operation to oversee like the Corps.

19:37.597 --> 19:43.022
So I saw it somewhat different to some of the other organizations like

19:43.964 --> 19:49.567
the health center and student counseling and some of the other groups.

19:50.310 --> 19:52.860
It didn't seem exactly parallel.

19:53.667 --> 19:55.691
But I didn't know what to make of all of that.

19:55.891 --> 20:01.663
But I, frankly, was a little dismayed by all of these efforts to do that.

20:01.763 --> 20:08.155
It was sort of embarrassing to me and put me in a very awkward spot, I thought.

20:08.436 --> 20:10.199
How did all that come to a conclusion?

20:10.540 --> 20:12.243
It kind of just fizzled out.

20:13.566 --> 20:16.131
There was no, they couldn't really,

20:16.735 --> 20:19.622
gain enough momentum to make any headway on that.

20:19.642 --> 20:27.199
I think, you know, John Colas or Dr. Vandiver never seriously considered that, I don't believe.

20:27.660 --> 20:34.356
Now Dr. Vandiver did give me, early on I met with him, and he did give me some

20:35.028 --> 20:39.193
directions, some ideas that he thought we ought to pursue.

20:39.834 --> 20:41.596
And some of them were a little complicated.

20:41.656 --> 20:43.918
I never could quite figure all of them out.

20:43.938 --> 20:45.881
I didn't know the full meaning of all of them.

20:46.621 --> 20:49.705
And his assistant, Art Blair, I don't know if you remember Art.

20:50.906 --> 20:57.214
Art was a former English professor at the Military Academy, been there 15 years or something.

20:57.814 --> 21:01.879
But he was a retired Army colonel, but he had hooked up with Dr. Vandenberg,

21:02.332 --> 21:04.322
And he was really his right-hand man.

21:04.382 --> 21:08.562
Art did a lot of work for Dr. Vandiver.

21:09.048 --> 21:18.278
and being a retired colonel from the academy and he was the, briefly, he was the superintendent or the, no, he was the commandant at the Citadel.

21:18.879 --> 21:28.550
So he'd had some experience in the job that I'm in and, you know, he had some advice and things to offer me, which I was glad to receive.

21:28.610 --> 21:30.412
So I visited a lot with Art Blair.

21:30.452 --> 21:34.716
I used to go on the side and sit down and we'd visit.

21:34.757 --> 21:36.118
He'd invite me to come over.

21:36.503 --> 21:51.480
But Art Blair, as I recall, developed kind of a series of thoughts and things that Dr. Vanderwood would like the commandant to pursue, and he gave those to me.

21:51.520 --> 21:55.945
Some of them looked almost impossible to me.

21:55.985 --> 22:00.030
I can't even remember the details of them, but I just remember they were

22:00.010 --> 22:05.200
rather complex and subject to interpretation what all that meant.

22:05.801 --> 22:12.072
But I think Dr. Vannevar felt, you know, the Corps needed some major changes.

22:12.654 --> 22:13.695
It needed an overhaul.

22:15.399 --> 22:17.783
And, you know, he wanted me to

22:18.623 --> 22:22.548
to do some of that, but Dr. Vandiver left after about one year, as I recall.

22:23.349 --> 22:25.672
So my time under him was rather limited.

22:25.692 --> 22:28.235
Right, now he's replaced by Bill Mobley?

22:28.255 --> 22:29.657
Well, Dean Gage, I believe.

22:29.717 --> 22:30.558
Oh, Dean Gage.

22:30.738 --> 22:31.739
See, I believe Dean Gage.

22:31.839 --> 22:32.360
No, let's see.

22:32.760 --> 22:33.541
No, Bill Mobley.

22:33.662 --> 22:34.743
Bill Mobley came in.

22:35.544 --> 22:37.166
Gage replaced Mobley.

22:37.366 --> 22:43.173
Was there much of a change as far as you were concerned in going from Vandiver to Mobley?

22:44.895 --> 22:45.296
Good deal.

22:46.377 --> 22:47.078
I found...

22:48.475 --> 22:53.301
Mobley, Dr. Mobley was very interested in the Corps.

22:53.521 --> 22:57.767
He recognized the strong support the Regents had for the Corps.

22:58.368 --> 23:07.019
He felt, I believe, a strong need to pay some attention to the Corps, to lend his support and all.

23:08.000 --> 23:15.129
I remember after Dr. Mobley was named president, he was working down in the old system of the Williams Building now.

23:15.209 --> 23:18.313
His office was down there and

23:19.913 --> 23:29.002
He called me up and before he ever moved into the president's chair and says, Tom, I'd like you to come down like tomorrow afternoon and sit down and visit with me a while.

23:29.683 --> 23:35.008
I want to talk about the Corps and find out more about what are the current hot buttons in the Corps.

23:35.528 --> 23:48.621
I thought that was kind of interesting that Bill Mobley called me down very quickly after he was appointed, named president, before he assumed the position to try to get a reading on the Corps.

23:49.124 --> 23:57.617
And I found him a very warm, friendly person, very supportive, wanting to do all he could.

23:57.717 --> 24:01.142
But I think, you know, he also read the Regents.

24:02.204 --> 24:12.600
I just can't emphasize enough how much the Regents were behind the Corps and gave me their total support.

24:13.373 --> 24:16.057
and wanted to do more to help.

24:17.158 --> 24:25.449
But Dr. Mobley was a very outgoing fellow that was a very popular man with everyone.

24:25.489 --> 24:27.071
His wife was very popular.

24:27.111 --> 24:31.757
I detected over his time that that tailed off.

24:32.979 --> 24:40.849
He had a lot of problems to deal with during his time and, you know, he had to tell a number of people no on things and

24:41.234 --> 24:45.880
And pretty soon you run out of popular support, I guess.

24:45.980 --> 24:50.145
I think in any position that's out to happen, especially in a job like that.

24:50.285 --> 24:54.350
But he would call me up sometimes.

24:54.410 --> 25:01.919
The faculty senate, this is one I'd like to get into again in a moment here, my relationship with the faculty senate and what I did there.

25:01.979 --> 25:07.005
But he seemed to have some reservations about the direction the faculty senate was going.

25:08.116 --> 25:15.565
And he called me up a time or two to have conversation and talk particular issues and all before a meeting or something.

25:16.205 --> 25:21.652
I thought it was rather unusual that I would get a call directly from the president like that.

25:22.212 --> 25:24.135
But he did that on more than one occasion.

25:25.757 --> 25:27.879
But he was very supportive of the Corps.

25:28.119 --> 25:31.183
He'd come to things and, you know, he played the role very well.

25:31.323 --> 25:35.628
I think early on he seemed pretty comfortable in the job.

25:36.309 --> 25:37.330
But again,

25:38.305 --> 25:44.339
I think his support and all kind of tailed down on the end there.

25:45.301 --> 25:53.479
And he had so many tough issues to deal with and it was unfortunate in my opinion.

25:54.387 --> 26:10.494
When you first began your service here as Commandant, how did you get introduced to the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps in terms of what was your relations with those branches of the service?

26:11.095 --> 26:15.602
Did you have any official relationship as Commandant with those?

26:17.455 --> 26:20.961
I don't know that I had any official connection with them.

26:21.142 --> 26:28.435
I knew people in each of those services, some of them the senior people that I had made while I was on active duty.

26:28.695 --> 26:32.562
So those relationships helped me for a while.

26:32.542 --> 26:37.369
You know, the more I was in the job, the more removed I became from the active service.

26:37.730 --> 26:42.917
But it was a rather informal connection I had with the services.

26:43.438 --> 26:43.558
Right.

26:43.578 --> 26:51.630
Of those four services, was there any difference in the Corps' relations, obligations, commitments to

26:52.859 --> 27:02.309
Was it any different for you that in dealing with a Corps member who was going into Army and Air Force or Marine Corps or Navy?

27:02.931 --> 27:04.135
Not really.

27:05.110 --> 27:06.231
I thought about that.

27:06.271 --> 27:08.514
You know, you got to wear one of the uniforms.

27:08.534 --> 27:09.595
So I was Air Force.

27:09.615 --> 27:12.178
So, you know, are the Air Force people going to get a break?

27:12.879 --> 27:17.003
Are they going to get the good deals because it's an Air Force guy?

27:17.103 --> 27:24.832
I determined in my own mind that I was not going to be in any way impartial or show any favoritism.

27:24.872 --> 27:28.536
In fact, if anything, I tried to be tougher on the Air Force people.

27:28.516 --> 27:32.733
because of my own service affiliation.

27:33.175 --> 27:34.400
But I tried to ignore that.

27:34.500 --> 27:36.147
I tried to pretend

27:36.346 --> 27:41.114
I'm in a purple suit here, meaning it's joint, it's all the same.

27:42.115 --> 27:44.679
And I didn't have any problems with that at all.

27:45.160 --> 27:47.804
I tried to promote the services the best I could.

27:47.845 --> 27:54.535
And when I came here, the Air Force was clearly the premier ROTC program.

27:54.575 --> 27:56.078
Had been for a number of years.

27:56.418 --> 27:59.123
Had the largest program, easiest to recruit.

27:59.143 --> 28:00.565
They didn't have...

28:00.545 --> 28:04.335
The ROTCs didn't do a very good job of recruiting, in my opinion.

28:04.796 --> 28:06.982
The Corps did most of the recruiting.

28:07.764 --> 28:09.428
And the services benefited from that.

28:09.549 --> 28:13.358
But the Air Force was very popular through that period.

28:13.619 --> 28:15.263
Was that nationally?

28:15.685 --> 28:16.647
Nationally.

28:16.627 --> 28:24.476
The Air Force always could meet its recruiting goals and all essentially high school graduates were enlisted and college people.

28:25.357 --> 28:35.429
But for many years they had been way out front in recruiting, disciplinary problems on active duty far less than the Air Force.

28:35.449 --> 28:39.153
You know, AWOLs, desertions, crimes, all of those things.

28:39.173 --> 28:43.258
The Air Force had always enjoyed statistics far superior to the other services.

28:43.298 --> 28:46.161
What was at the other end of the spectrum?

28:47.609 --> 29:00.144
Well, the Marine Corps had not been great in some statistics, but it's the mission of the service that drives a lot of this, I've come to conclude.

29:01.105 --> 29:06.151
The Army is one that lives out in the field and crawls on their belly and stays in tents and all that.

29:06.631 --> 29:10.596
The Air Force generally is known for having good quarters.

29:10.576 --> 29:12.639
cushy jobs, some would say.

29:12.719 --> 29:15.744
And so, you know, part of that is the attraction.

29:15.764 --> 29:24.758
The Air Force has always been a very technical service and has attracted some of the most skilled people where the Marine Corps needs the riflemen out there.

29:24.838 --> 29:29.665
That's the primary point of their

29:30.235 --> 29:37.410
their services to put these guys, this team out there and the Army too to a great extent.

29:37.771 --> 29:45.207
But the Army program was pretty flat when I came here and I'm told that

29:46.553 --> 29:49.417
you know, that had been neglected a little bit.

29:50.759 --> 29:53.322
I don't know too much about all that.

29:53.342 --> 30:02.434
I wasn't here, so I can't say a whole lot, but I know that their numbers were not as good as we had hoped they would be or expected.

30:04.617 --> 30:12.307
The Navy program was still a fairly new program in terms of, in comparison to the Army and the Air Force.

30:13.088 --> 30:16.493
And it struck me as a little strange that there was always a Marine program

30:17.806 --> 30:20.469
colonel that headed the Naval ROTC program.

30:21.650 --> 30:32.380
And I learned from General Simpson that he was instrumental in getting that program established and he wrote it in the rules that the PNS would always be a marine colonel.

30:33.241 --> 30:45.973
He and Olin Teague, Tiger Teague, helped to get that going to broaden so that A&M could have all the services.

30:46.308 --> 30:49.333
How did you all recruit corps members in those days?

30:50.394 --> 30:55.402
When I came here, Buck Henderson was the unofficial recruiting officer.

30:55.462 --> 30:57.865
It was an additional duty, I would say, for Buck.

30:57.885 --> 31:13.108
He had other responsibilities, but recruiting consisted mainly of having parents and students stop in the office of the commandant, and Buck would give them a little short briefing and talk to them about it.

31:15.316 --> 31:17.981
We had some old flyers that had been around a while.

31:18.061 --> 31:23.491
Had one brochure, I think it was, say a flyer, a brochure called Rise and Shine.

31:23.531 --> 31:24.773
Been around here for years.

31:24.873 --> 31:29.562
At the new student conferences.
