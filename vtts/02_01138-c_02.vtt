00:02.005 --> 00:12.699
Something I think both you and I agree, that failed 
to capture the essence of Texas and the Southwest

00:02.005 --> 00:12.699
and the attitudes of people like yourself. Who 
really knew it. Who knew it, who went out, who

00:14.041 --> 00:21.471
fought for it, who struggled through it, who have 
that inner identity with it. And yet you were

00:22.452 --> 00:24.655
called a country bumpkin. You were put down. Even 
my ex-husband was put down, right? That's so true.

00:31.023 --> 00:37.034
We saw something that was such an atrocity to 
really the preservation of history.

00:40.240 --> 00:49.056
When you grow up in a town, and you see things, and 
you live in a house, and you know it, and then

00:40.240 --> 00:49.056
somebody come along and tell you, oh no, this is 
right. that lived across the Mason-Vixon line and

00:49.407 --> 00:54.474
had probably never been in Johnson City. And then 
they come in here and tell you what is what. That's a

00:57.900 --> 00:59.342
bunch for the birds. You do not go in and transform a 
community into what you fascinate it to be, you

00:59.642 --> 01:08.956
know, what your fascination might be that it is. 
You don't set your birthright either. No, which is

01:11.800 --> 01:16.845
something that the National Park did try to do to 
you. I'm glad they're out of the picture now and

01:17.686 --> 01:24.934
that we're into something that's actually 
preserving history. Is it about time to eat? You

01:26.195 --> 01:27.016
want some hell? I've got to get this dinner going. 
We're going to eat. It's a burplish cucumber. I

01:32.842 --> 01:35.985
don't care how big it is. The deer ate the end of this 
off.

01:45.972 --> 01:47.133
You can't believe that. I don't expect you to. What 
is that now? That's a cucumber? What kind is it?

01:53.561 --> 01:54.041
Berkley's. Berkley's. Snake. Oh, how good. Well, 
of course it's good. I've never had one like that.

02:02.451 --> 02:08.638
Any time that I serve you something you can't eat, 
well, you just let me know, will you? I have never

02:08.658 --> 02:12.402
turned down anything yet, Ava.

02:21.173 --> 02:32.363
You know what you do with that, or I do with it 
rather, I take it and I put this Italian dressing on

02:21.173 --> 02:32.363
it. No, that's good. I left that outside for a long 
time. The seed's getting a little bit large. Did

02:40.831 --> 02:42.593
you have a garden this year, Ava? I started, but 
then I got hurt and I didn't get to finish it. Yeah.

02:50.519 --> 03:00.789
Now, I know that you're going to say, Miss Eve, I 
just can't believe this, but everybody has to fix

02:50.519 --> 03:00.789
his own salad. But you take a raw squash, like I'm 
going to slice right here, and you put a little

03:01.249 --> 03:18.486
light salt on it and a little accent, and you use 
that salad dressing in there. I'll tell you.

03:19.443 --> 03:22.227
cream, salad dressing. And you'll say, well, I 
just don't know. I never had anything like this. I

03:28.916 --> 03:30.739
don't know whether I even want to taste it or not. I 
don't like squash. There you go. But you'll find

03:34.444 --> 03:40.272
out that it doesn't taste like squash. But it's 
good. I like raw squash.

03:45.079 --> 03:47.863
I like them cooked.

03:50.071 --> 03:55.558
meats, and fry them. That's not very good for you, 
but. What, the fry? Uh-huh. How do you fry your

03:59.543 --> 04:01.405
squash? The old-fashioned way, honey. Tell me. 
I'll see if that's something I know how to do. All

04:07.853 --> 04:08.254
right. Dip them in buttermilk. In buttermilk? 
Uh-huh. And sprinkle them with meal, and then fry

04:11.798 --> 04:18.226
them and leave them there. Mm. I don't think I've 
had them that way. It sounds good. Well, the

04:21.406 --> 04:31.137
buttermilk holds the... Of course, you know, in 
old times, you made use of what you had. And you

04:32.139 --> 04:37.084
didn't disturb the cream on your milk. And you 
churned every other day. And you kept that

04:39.727 --> 04:43.932
buttermilk. And that's why you'd always get 
buttermilk. I see.

04:52.643 --> 04:58.409
Yeah, you've come a long way in the kitchen from 
when you first began to grow up and eat out there on

04:52.643 --> 04:58.409
the ranch. Yes, I have. Sort of. You'll have to tell 
me a little more about that. About first meals. You

05:09.360 --> 05:21.773
know, quite a difference in the management of a 
kitchen that you cook on a fireplace than one that

05:09.360 --> 05:21.773
you have a push-button kitchen. Well, I don't 
exactly have a push-button kitchen, but I do have

05:22.073 --> 05:31.387
some conveniences far from the fireplace. Now, 
you see all of these tomato peelings, squash bits,

05:31.407 --> 05:39.379
cucumber bits. No, they wouldn't go in the 
disposal unit. You know where they'd go? Where?

05:45.188 --> 05:51.237
They'd go in a little can that would have a lid on it, 
which was a molasses bucket, usually. They sat on a

05:51.824 --> 05:59.492
workbench or a work table, which would be much like 
this table right here. And you would turn around,

06:00.433 --> 06:06.599
grab all that stuff up and put it in there. Then you 
had a garbage bucket on the outside of the house

06:06.939 --> 06:18.411
that you put this stuff in and took and fed to the 
hogs. Uh-huh. You recycled it, more or less. Yes,

06:20.133 --> 06:20.894
sir. Really? Everything had purpose. You bet. You 
wasted nothing. Wasted nothing.

06:28.695 --> 06:31.838
Well, I don't regret it. I think I lived the most 
wonderful days that Texas will ever see. Anybody

06:38.624 --> 06:39.965
in Texas. I think that, of course, that's my 
prerogative to believe that, but am I right? I

06:50.935 --> 06:51.075
think But you take how many, well, there's just not 
too many people living today that can call back the

06:51.427 --> 07:10.798
time that Pancho Villa invaded Texas. And 
remember it. And remember how we were stirred up

07:13.041 --> 07:18.750
about it and what it really meant. Then we come 
along to World War I, then World War II,

07:19.760 --> 07:31.771
then the Korean, then the Vietnamese. You've seen 
them all. I have. And sit on my grandpappy's lap,

07:35.534 --> 07:44.802
and curl that long white beard, and hear him tell 
the stories of the Civil War. You've known all of

07:45.463 --> 07:49.446
America's wars through. I'm telling you, to me, 
that is a wonderful time to live. And when my

07:55.895 --> 08:06.129
granddaddy Pepe was buried, there were six 
Confederate soldiers at his funeral. I can't

08:06.149 --> 08:10.495
remember all of the song, but I can remember part of 
it. I'll lay away a suit of gray to wear till the

08:11.016 --> 08:15.502
Union blew. Six old Confederates sang it. How 
beautiful. And to me, that was touching. I don't

08:26.481 --> 08:27.142
know. That's just my way of life. I think of those 
things as.

08:38.076 --> 08:39.057
I think of them too. I do often.

08:44.144 --> 08:46.366
Because I only knew one of my grandfathers too. 
You've been fortunate to know many of them. I knew.

08:49.670 --> 08:50.331
Both of mine. Both of yours.

08:56.378 --> 08:58.881
Oh, those are beautiful.

09:01.203 --> 09:01.964
Piece of art. They really are. He just talking. 
He's got it down. Yeah, he likes good

09:09.633 --> 09:15.880
food too. Good cooking is an art. Oh, look at that. 
Where do you want it? You can put one over there on

09:18.968 --> 09:20.509
the bar. OK. Or no, let's eat on the table. Shoot, 
fire. There's no sense in that. OK.

09:31.879 --> 09:38.265
Here, eye pockets.

09:38.285 --> 09:42.268
These are not very good, but they'll answer the 
purpose today. Over here. Oh, shoot, fire. These

09:48.432 --> 09:49.093
are better. Here, I'll get that while you get the 
telephone. Well, get the plates out. I will, Ava.

10:02.668 --> 10:03.529
Anyway, your daddy was? My daddy was president of 
the old Trail Drivers of Texas for years. And I

10:09.435 --> 10:14.841
believe the last year that he served as Trail 
Driver of Texas, There was only three living. I

10:20.312 --> 10:29.804
have a picture that hangs on my wall of the last five 
original trail drivers in Texas. And that's where

10:29.824 --> 10:42.820
I found out about the Copes, the Browns, the 
Lovings, and all of them, was through the old trail

10:29.824 --> 10:42.820
drivers and their organization that met in San 
Antonio at the Gunner Hotel. And I used to go down

10:43.643 --> 10:49.174
there with my daddy to meetings. And having driven 
cattle from San Antonio to Johnson City when I

10:49.194 --> 10:58.753
wasn't but 10 years old, I know what cattle driving 
is back in those days. Now let me tell you, that was

10:59.635 --> 11:01.499
something. And don't think it isn't, man. When 
they come by here. advertising a trail ride to go do

11:05.952 --> 11:09.496
something. For fun, right? For fun. It was no fun. 
It was no fun to me. Well, they don't do it like we had

11:16.284 --> 11:18.727
to do it. It was no fancy salon to bring your cattle 
through. And it was thick cedar. And I'm telling

11:27.738 --> 11:31.242
you, that was something else driving those 
things. My daddy bought a bunch of Mexico steers.

11:35.527 --> 11:35.727
Mm-hmm. Mm. That was horrible. You picked him up in 
San Antonio? San Antonio. How many head? 150. 150,

11:43.654 --> 11:44.175
wow. I got home with 75. Really?

11:51.947 --> 11:54.851
You know how we knew our stairs from anybody 
else's? The tails was cut off. That's the truth.

12:00.489 --> 12:01.129
That was the brain? The bobtail. They bobtailed 
every one of those steers. Mm-hmm. So that, you

12:05.675 --> 12:10.081
know, a steer will have a curl or a cow. And whenever 
they lose that curl in their tail, they're too old.

12:13.265 --> 12:14.226
They go to the market. Now, that's one of the 
markings my daddy told me as a little girl. If

12:18.792 --> 12:26.702
you're not sure how old that cow is or whatnot, when 
that tail, that curl is out of that tail, ship them.

12:27.509 --> 12:28.110
Really? So when we took these steers off and ran 
them through the pen, we cut the tails off every one

12:28.470 --> 12:35.159
of them. That long tussle. Mm-hmm. For their fly 
swatter. Mm-hmm. So that we'd know how to tell them

12:39.524 --> 12:44.250
if they were lost. And we had a... There at the sea 
blow, we had a storm come up. Mm-hmm. And, well,

12:49.857 --> 12:52.481
they call it sea wall now, I think. But anyway, we 
called it the sea blow. Mm-hmm. Now... Our cattle

12:58.458 --> 13:02.604
stampeded and ran in every direction. But by call 
and by herding the next morning, we were able to get

13:03.665 --> 13:11.076
the biggest part of them back. And it started out 
again. Don't tell me. I've often heard of

13:15.382 --> 13:22.592
lightning jumping from horn to horn or hitting 
balls of fire. I did. I was like that little colored

13:24.288 --> 13:25.950
boy. I was willing, but my feet just wouldn't stand 
still. I got back to that wagon and I

13:30.476 --> 13:36.183
hurt. You told me about that one time. It made an 
impression on me that I'll never forget. That's

13:40.669 --> 13:41.890
scary. What happened? It was a storm came up. 
Thundering, electrical storm. And when the

13:49.720 --> 13:52.343
lightning had come out, It would just jump like 
from horn to horn on those stairs. That stuff was

13:57.787 --> 13:59.229
electricity. Balls of fire. I don't know what 
you'd call it because I never had the opportunity

14:01.191 --> 14:10.544
to see a bunch of stock in a herd that many. And it was 
heat that drew it, I'm sure. I think that's the

14:16.572 --> 14:20.516
static electricity that causes that. I've heard 
of that, and you told me that story once before. I

14:23.819 --> 14:26.001
mean, I'm not kidding. I never was scared of that in 
my life. Mm-hmm. It's amazing. You ever seen that?

14:33.189 --> 14:33.929
Heard of that? Mm-hmm. I wonder if I could have 
another one of those fattening biscuits over

14:36.612 --> 14:39.975
here. I just cannot resist it. Does that look like 
somebody's coming in here? It sure did. Oh, thank

14:45.901 --> 14:46.562
you. Hello. Yes. Come in.

14:51.915 --> 14:52.796
Well, what are we? Well, how are you, Ms. Stewart? 
Oh, I thought I'd come over here and welcome you to

14:58.563 --> 15:00.606
this street. Well, good. Hello. Can I have some 
beer with us? No, thank you. I come over here. I

15:05.432 --> 15:09.758
didn't know Lena called me and said you were going 
to have to go to Kitty Clyde and copy this down.

15:09.778 --> 15:10.479
That's right. Oh, well, great. But one's a little 
different. Well, I bet I can copy it and get it

15:13.963 --> 15:15.866
right. Mm-hmm. Well, you don't have to come and 
just study. Just study, huh? Sit down. Miss

15:22.551 --> 15:27.001
Stewart, this is my friend that used to work with 
the park here. Cynthia Ott. Hi. And I don't know

15:29.687 --> 15:31.230
your name. Luke? Luke! In my pocket. I need a little 
ceiling up there. No, but I'll sit down here and

15:37.436 --> 15:41.180
I'll show you this. Yes, you will. All right. I 
didn't know you had something here. I wouldn't

15:43.462 --> 15:44.163
have come out. I just come out of that garden of 
digging around. Well, I've been in the house

15:46.485 --> 15:50.529
digging, trying to get things put away. And I was 
late with dinner. You look like you're doing real

15:52.931 --> 15:54.693
good around here with that. Well, I'm late. You'd 
better have a roll with us. No, thank you. I got

16:02.483 --> 16:05.126
dinner cooked. This one, it just changes a little 
bit. I didn't bring my glasses. But this is the last

16:12.295 --> 16:13.676
one I have. I nearly worn it out. They only, I had. 
Ate them. Yeah. Food. Now, this is a funeral. Yeah,

16:21.786 --> 16:22.367
a funeral. Yellow symbolizes constancy, teaches 
faithful obedience to the demands of honor and

16:22.527 --> 16:29.095
justice. Ruth exemplified these virtues in 
humble station and sought the society of good and

16:29.665 --> 16:42.682
truth. In token of appreciation of these virtues, 
I deposit the full tribute. That's the part that's

16:47.148 --> 16:49.431
different. Now, that means it often changes it 
here. Yeah. And it's easier to say this than it is

16:52.816 --> 16:55.039
that. But you aren't going to have a flyer to 
deposit saying Jerry told me. Have you lost

17:00.243 --> 17:03.812
someone in the group? No, we're expecting 
someone. I

17:08.463 --> 17:13.776
understand. I understand. That's a lot easier to 
say. Yeah, it's a lot easier than this other. Yeah.

17:33.773 --> 17:38.760
Well, I'll just get my pencil right now and put this 
down. Yeah, yeah, you can. Just take this and then

17:39.742 --> 17:43.067
just make that change and write the change down. 
Because that's a lot easier for me. Oh, do you like

17:45.771 --> 17:47.013
okra? I brought you a little. Well, great. You know 
I do, huh? How is your garden? Do you have a garden

17:54.223 --> 17:55.564
this year? Yes, I have a garden. It's a pretty big 
one, but some of it's already withered. Oh, yeah,

18:01.571 --> 18:03.392
it's in the forest. They took care of it in the 
forest. That rain was so much. They live in Austin.

18:08.678 --> 18:09.319
They came up. I eat a lot of squash raw. I just 
introduced her to raw squash today. I don't think

18:15.525 --> 18:17.067
she'd ever taste it. I love it. This is old for her. 
Is it? Well, good. I eat it raw and I eat it cooked.

18:27.080 --> 18:31.167
Now this is the one we use? Yeah, that one. All 
right, now then.

18:37.527 --> 18:38.249
Ruthie. I didn't know you were having dinner, 
Laura. I wouldn't have bothered you. I thought you

18:41.436 --> 18:45.485
may be going to leave just in a little while the 
kitty cries. So I just went on over here. Yeah, but I

18:46.367 --> 18:55.308
was going to go over there and copy. Mm-hmm.

18:59.212 --> 19:03.223
We kept her talking, so we got around to eating 
light. Why don't I leave the books for you and let

19:04.407 --> 19:08.378
you cop it, and then I'll come get it. Well, you 
might want to study it. Let me get started. Well,

19:12.476 --> 19:13.197
all right. I think I'm practically annoyed. I've 
had three days to burn it. Well, I didn't know it

19:16.922 --> 19:18.905
until last night. Well, she called me about, she 
called everybody about three days ago. Well, she

19:23.031 --> 19:24.473
sure didn't call me. But that's nothing. I've 
never been considered a member of that Eastern

19:25.795 --> 19:30.641
Star since I've been in there. That's right. I 
stayed two weeks in that hospital. Mm-hmm. And two

19:35.442 --> 19:40.428
days before I was to leave, they sent me some 
flowers. But I guess she was in a hurry because she

19:40.448 --> 19:44.473
said she had to take her daughter home. I think her 
daughter's been in the hospital or sick or

19:44.493 --> 19:48.678
something. I don't know. Well, Kitty Clyde didn't 
even tell me. Well, she said she, I believe she

19:52.182 --> 19:58.209
called me the day before yesterday that she had to 
go. Yeah, and she didn't think she'd get back. She

20:00.572 --> 20:01.433
said maybe Pat. Yeah, we've had

20:02.830 --> 20:11.271
it here.
