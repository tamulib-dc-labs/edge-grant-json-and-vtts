00:07.135 --> 00:15.328
Time, 152, Washington, D.C., Office of the 
Oceanography. Admiral Snyder, would you explain

00:15.348 --> 00:19.113
to us how you first developed an interest in the 
sea? What drew you towards the oceans themselves?

00:22.018 --> 00:24.101
Well, do you mean towards oceanography or towards 
the Navy? Towards the oceans. What made you decide

00:24.762 --> 00:26.745
to be a career naval man? Well, my parents, my 
father was a Methodist minister, and he was the

00:27.066 --> 00:33.936
fifth generation Methodist minister, and I 
didn't want to go into the ministry, and For some

00:34.709 --> 00:37.432
weird reason, as a kid grows up, he wants to be a 
fireman. I wanted to be a Navy man. So when I was five

00:39.194 --> 00:49.465
years old, Senator Gerald P. Nye, who was one of 
these Republican isolationists who stayed

00:39.194 --> 00:49.465
forever in North Dakota, appointed me to the 
United States Naval Academy for 1945. Enter in the

00:50.106 --> 00:53.089
year, I'm sorry, enter in the year 1942. And this 
was circa 1930 that he appointed me. I worked

00:58.435 --> 01:00.016
towards that. We built a retirement home outside. 
My father built a retirement home outside of

01:01.898 --> 01:03.940
Annapolis. I went in one year earlier than the 
senator had appointed me under a civil service

01:04.420 --> 01:09.385
competitive and always wanted to be in the Navy. I 
certainly never regretted a day of not having made

01:09.405 --> 01:15.210
that decision. Why did Gerald Nye appoint you 12 
years in advance? In North Dakota, they didn't

01:18.153 --> 01:20.295
even know about the Navy. They always knew West 
Point and the senatorials. Each senator had two

01:22.917 --> 01:27.261
seats in both West Point and the Naval Academy 
before World War II and two from each of the Each of

01:27.663 --> 01:28.984
the congressmen had two. And the appointments to 
the Naval Academy went begging. The appointments

01:32.748 --> 01:34.529
to West Point were very competitive. And my father 
was the district superintendent. And I guess that

01:36.531 --> 01:47.882
in those days, before World War II, almost all, 
about 75% now, maybe you're wrong on this figure,

01:36.531 --> 01:47.882
but a significant number, over 51% of the 
appointees to the Naval Academy were political.

01:48.563 --> 01:53.848
Now they're almost all, even if they're 
political, they're all competitive on civil

01:48.563 --> 01:53.848
service basis because so many people want to go. 
And when... Well, at Annapolis, did you have any

01:56.755 --> 02:00.219
drawings toward it? Were you guided towards 
something like oceanography, for example? Did

02:03.122 --> 02:04.583
you assume to be a line officer? No, I had always 
wanted to be in nuclear physics for some weird

02:04.683 --> 02:08.127
reason. I can't explain exactly why. And it was 
even before the H-bomb, or the A-bomb, rather,

02:09.689 --> 02:12.992
that I'd wanted to be there. I'd always wanted to do 
graduate work. And I think that's a function of the

02:14.954 --> 02:20.000
parentage I had, that there was a tremendous drive 
to get advanced degree. My father had a PhD and a

02:20.020 --> 02:23.303
DDS. The whole family was sort of 
education-happy, if you know what I mean, in that

02:23.435 --> 02:27.040
generation. I'd wanted to be in nuclear physics. 
When I graduated from the Naval Academy, I thought

02:29.264 --> 02:32.969
I wanted to be in flight training. My wife did not 
want me to be in flight training, so I went through

02:33.250 --> 02:45.988
indoctrination of flight training, then went to 
sea and never had a second thought about going into

02:33.250 --> 02:45.988
aviation, never had any desire to go into 
submarines and wanted to be a destroyer, a tin can

02:33.250 --> 02:45.988
driver. Right after the war, I put in to go to 
postgraduate school at MIT to get a a doctor's

02:52.055 --> 02:53.356
degree in nuclear physics. I was turned down on the 
grounds I hadn't had enough sea duty. And each time

02:56.620 --> 03:06.850
I got eligible to be a principal and was selected to 
be a principal for postgraduate education, I

02:56.620 --> 03:06.850
would end up by having a job where nobody would 
release me. I finally got into nuclear physics

03:07.811 --> 03:15.078
through the back door by a weird rule in the Navy 
that doesn't permit ensigns, that's the lowest

03:07.811 --> 03:15.078
rank, to serve on shore duty. A young officer who 
was an ensign was serving at Los Alamos, New Mexico

03:15.979 --> 03:21.184
in the nuclear physics program. They found out 
what the law was, so they ordered me. And I was then a

03:24.883 --> 03:28.307
Lieutenant JG to his replacement. And by the time I 
got there, he had already been promoted. But

03:31.271 --> 03:33.033
anyhow, I went out there. I was going to go to 
postgraduate school that year, so I went to Los

03:33.053 --> 03:37.398
Alamos, New Mexico instead. I stayed there under, 
I think my orders were classified. My classified

03:42.504 --> 03:45.788
orders told me I was to work on the bomb project. My 
unclassified orders said I was to go to the

03:45.848 --> 03:50.614
University of New Mexico in an NROTC program. I 
went and worked at Los Alamos, New Mexico as a,

03:51.235 --> 04:01.532
first a staff assistant, and then, I can't 
remember the exact title, but then a staff member.

04:02.874 --> 04:15.154
I was never in uniform, but I was working on the 
initiator for the hydrogen weapon at that time,

04:02.874 --> 04:15.154
and had always wanted to go to school, and was still 
putting in for school at that particular point in

04:02.874 --> 04:15.154
life. I stayed there, I believe, two years, and 
then went to sea for a year in order to get the

04:18.539 --> 04:22.225
adequate necessary sea time. And then I went to 
Naval Postgraduate System and then went to MIT,

04:22.245 --> 04:27.934
but did not complete a PhD. I was only allowed two 
years there, and it took a minimum of four at that

04:27.994 --> 04:32.081
time. So I ended up with a master's degree in 
nuclear physics. Came back, went through various

04:36.188 --> 04:44.361
phases of sea duty, then was assigned in my shore 
job, my next shore job, was assigned to be the

04:44.780 --> 04:55.112
Polaris reentry body systems officer because of 
my nuclear physics background, because of my

04:44.780 --> 04:55.112
assignment in Los Alamos, and because Admiral 
Rickover wouldn't permit an assignment of a

04:44.780 --> 04:55.112
nuclear submarine if they weren't too scarce to 
take the job. So although not being submarine

04:55.172 --> 05:07.607
qualified, my job there was Polaris reentry body 
systems design officer at Lockheed in

04:55.172 --> 05:07.607
California, and also the atomic energy 
representative on the Polaris program in circa

04:55.172 --> 05:07.607
1958. I did that job, then I went to War college and I 
went to see in command of a destroyer and while I was

05:12.100 --> 05:40.268
in command of a destroyer The assistant secretary 
of the Navy for research and development was

05:12.100 --> 05:40.268
attempting to fill a billet for special assistant 
here in Washington and Again, Admiral Rickover

05:12.100 --> 05:40.268
had not enough qualified officers to fill his 
requirements at sea So very few of them were

05:12.100 --> 05:40.268
allowed to go ashore So again, I got involved in 
what I would consider submarine business, even

05:12.100 --> 05:40.268
though I was not a qualified submariner And during 
the meantime, during all this history, I'd also

05:40.990 --> 05:50.259
been interviewed by Admiral Rickover, and I'd 
been rejected by the admiral for command of the

05:40.990 --> 05:50.259
Bainbridge or executive officer of the Long 
Beach. I'm not sure which job. I had always wanted

05:52.701 --> 05:53.882
to do that. In 1958, I'd put a letter in requesting 
command of the first nuclear power destroyer

05:53.902 --> 06:03.971
circa 1960, which was about the time I was 
interviewed by Admiral Rickover. I then was

06:04.812 --> 06:08.095
accepted by the assistant secretary the Navy to be 
his special assistant. I'm not sure exactly why he

06:10.824 --> 06:12.787
accepted me. He asked me if I'd had any tour duty in 
Washington. I said no. He asked me what I thought

06:17.154 --> 06:21.722
about the Bureau of Ordinance, and I said it ought 
to be reorganized. He asked me what I thought about

06:21.742 --> 06:25.388
the Bureau of Ships, and I said I thought it should 
be abolished or combined. Maybe it was I was a

06:26.831 --> 06:28.534
maverick. I don't know for sure. I then went back to 
the Brownson. My memory here is a little bit hazy.

06:35.800 --> 06:37.102
It was circa April 63. The thresher was lost right 
off of where I was with my ship, but my ship was on its

06:37.162 --> 06:42.729
way to the Navy yard. So I came down and reported to 
the assistant secretary on temporary duty, even

06:43.190 --> 06:57.870
though I was not to be permanently assigned to him 
until June or July, and started taking over the

06:43.190 --> 06:57.870
secretarial responsibility for oceanography, 
if you will, by accident. And I suppose that it's a

06:58.731 --> 07:02.837
fair statement that since April of 63, My primary 
job ashore in the Navy has, in fact, been

07:03.323 --> 07:07.087
oceanography. And I've been closely associated 
from that day forward. I have a couple of follow-up

07:11.292 --> 07:14.395
questions I should like to ask right here. First of 
all, with which assistant secretary were you

07:16.678 --> 07:19.982
attached? The first assistant secretary, Dr. 
Wakeman. I've actually served for every

07:22.124 --> 07:28.972
assistant secretary for R&D because of the timing 
involved and because of Dr. Frosch stayed so long.

07:29.032 --> 07:31.795
He was still here when I came back from Vietnam. Dr. 
Wakeland was the first assistant secretary. I

07:35.568 --> 07:37.691
believe he served five years less five days. He was 
the one who was instrumental in setting up the

07:39.094 --> 07:43.801
Interagency Committee on Oceanography. It was he 
who went to Mr. Eisenhower, who was then president

07:43.821 --> 07:48.830
of the United States, and got the president 
interested in oceanography. It was he who

07:50.372 --> 07:59.487
encouraged the Navy to participate with the other 
agencies and with the academic institutions to

07:50.372 --> 07:59.487
significantly increase their budgets in 
oceanography. And I think he could be properly

08:00.175 --> 08:07.568
really referred to as almost the founder of major 
oceanographic programs in the federal

08:00.175 --> 08:07.568
government. That would be my assessment. Perhaps 
it's biased from the fact I worked for him. But I

08:11.034 --> 08:18.428
think without him, we certainly wouldn't be where 
we were today in spite of the National Academy

08:11.034 --> 08:18.428
report and in spite of other things. But I think he 
was the driving force in the bureaucracy that was

08:18.528 --> 08:22.555
interested. Even though he was responsible for 
all of Navy research and development, including

08:22.923 --> 08:29.072
weapon systems, he put a significant amount of 
time. He almost was the kind of individual who put a

08:29.092 --> 08:33.037
40-hour work week on four or five separate 
subjects. And I was his specialist assistant for

08:33.178 --> 08:39.687
oceanography, submarines, Polaris, and a few 
other side things. And I put at least 60 hours a week

08:39.707 --> 08:43.553
in oceanography. And it was a very interesting 
time in oceanography because there was no

08:43.573 --> 08:50.162
competition in a bureaucratic sense. The Navy 
felt, under Wakeman's leadership, that so much

08:50.513 --> 08:55.297
had to be done that they were not concerned who did 
it. The Navy felt that it needed to be

08:56.078 --> 08:58.540
significantly expanded. When I say in the Navy, 
I'm speaking of Jim Wakeman, because the Navy has

08:58.560 --> 09:07.427
so many problems, it never knows which problem is 
on top other than the one at the critical time.

09:11.271 --> 09:13.172
Wakeman left, and Dr. Morse came. And I served the 
full two years with Dr. Morse when he was assistant

09:13.212 --> 09:16.655
secretary. And I served one year plus maybe six 
months with Dr. Frosch, who relieved Dr. Morse.

09:24.096 --> 09:25.438
Then I went to sea in Vietnam. I came back, had a 
tour, continued tour at sea in Newport, Rhode

09:25.498 --> 09:36.313
Island, made admiral, spent about six or seven 
months as admiral's bill at Norfolk. And Dr.

09:36.353 --> 09:42.141
Frosch asked me to come back and relieve Admiral 
Behrens as oceanographer, if Admiral Behrens

09:36.353 --> 09:42.141
left. And when that happened, I kept both jobs till 
about June. And I've been here full time since June

09:46.066 --> 09:50.372
of 70, I guess it is. And there's been some 
controversy, which I'm sure you're aware of, in

09:53.908 --> 10:00.116
the interim and so forth. Exactly what did you do in 
Vietnam? I need this with a specific

10:01.938 --> 10:04.060
oceanography. I did no specific oceanography in 
Vietnam except looking for several downed

10:04.581 --> 10:09.587
aircraft. The job I had in Vietnam was commanding 
officer of the last battleship, the New Jersey,

10:10.388 --> 10:15.694
which was activated. It was a joke, but it was 
covered, and I can't ever find the piece of paper,

10:18.668 --> 10:36.494
but it was covered in the ships of oceanography as 
the world's largest oceanographic ship, and I

10:18.668 --> 10:36.494
think there were several jokes about how quiet it 
was because the machinery was 1,500 men pulling on

10:18.668 --> 10:36.494
ropes, but we had a full suit of oceanographic 
equipment on board except a submersible. We put a

10:36.514 --> 10:41.000
submersible on board and it was taken off because 
nobody wanted us to have it. We had handheld sonars

10:41.441 --> 10:47.089
and we had salvage and survival gear, but we were so 
contained on the demilitarized DMZ, that's the

10:47.558 --> 11:03.396
demilitarized zone, by the Army and the Marine 
Corps that they were so imbued with a capability of

10:47.558 --> 11:03.396
this piece of artillery that I never got a chance to 
play games, as I would call it, by playing with

10:47.558 --> 11:03.396
oceanography. And then you, after this tour of 
duty in Vietnam, then you come back and... No, then

11:03.416 --> 11:13.768
I go to Newport, Rhode Island, where I was chief of 
staff to the destroyer force, which was an

11:03.416 --> 11:13.768
administrative job, plus trying to get them to do 
things. I was interested in doing a lot of work in

11:15.506 --> 11:23.458
anti-submarine warfare, trying to get the Navy 
back in oceanography from a combatant side of the

11:15.506 --> 11:23.458
viewpoint. And then when I made admiral, I became 
head of the training command of the Navy east of the

11:23.498 --> 11:30.368
Mississippi. The Navy has two training commands, 
east and west of Mississippi. So I had charge of all

11:34.234 --> 11:39.942
the Navy schoolhouses and so forth east of 
Mississippi. and that gave me some chance to

11:40.259 --> 11:44.103
exercise oceanography, but not really greatly. 
Would you characterize your developing interest

11:44.824 --> 11:51.931
in oceanography primarily through 
anti-submarine warfare, since you've always

11:44.824 --> 11:51.931
been a destroyer man? No, I would characterize it 
by falling into it with the thresher going down and

11:53.092 --> 12:08.308
being put in it under the leadership of Wakeman, 
and I think anybody that's been subject to Mr.

11:53.092 --> 12:08.308
Wakeman's leadership sort of gets part of his 
enthusiasm wiped off on him, and I think the

11:53.092 --> 12:08.308
challenge of the of oceanography, once you see it, 
is certainly clear to me. Now, let's be sure you and

12:12.469 --> 12:16.613
I understand what we mean by oceanography. In the 
Navy, oceanography is very clearly defined. It's

12:19.156 --> 12:27.204
not anywhere else, but it surely is in the Navy, and 
I even wrote the definition of that and finally got

12:19.156 --> 12:27.204
the Secretary of the Navy to sign it, and it's very 
broad in the Navy. It covers so much that when the

12:27.965 --> 12:32.890
Secretary first looked at it, he said, you're 
writing a charter for the Chief of Naval

12:27.965 --> 12:32.890
Operations. We'll have to change a few words. What 
it basically is is all that science, technology,

12:36.098 --> 12:45.454
operations, engineering that is necessary to 
develop and exploit the world's oceans for

12:36.098 --> 12:45.454
military and other national needs except for 
weapon systems design. But then, on the other

12:45.474 --> 12:54.470
hand, it includes how does the weapon system 
operate in the environment and how do you use the

12:45.474 --> 12:54.470
weapon system if it's an underwater weapon 
system, for example. So it's pretty inclusive,

12:55.431 --> 12:57.094
even though In dollars, it isn't advertised as 
much more than $200 million. You probably have $2

13:00.734 --> 13:07.643
billion underneath of the tip of that iceberg in 
anti-submarine warfare surveillance and things

13:00.734 --> 13:07.643
like that. A question that's anticipating things 
in the future we're speaking of, really. But the

13:14.912 --> 13:26.406
charge has been that the Navy has become less and 
less interested in pure science in terms of R&D and

13:14.912 --> 13:26.406
more and more interested in specific sciences, 
that is, sciences which would... aid the Navy in

13:27.196 --> 13:29.659
military affairs only. That's called the 
Mansfield Amendment. That's right, exactly what

13:32.242 --> 13:33.644
that's called. I think that when you say the Navy, I 
think you always have to be a little bit careful. I

13:37.729 --> 13:41.073
live in the Navy, so the Navy is like any other 
organization. There are at least 12 different

13:41.093 --> 13:43.797
voices in the Navy. I think that what they mean is a 
true statement, except in oceanography. An

13:48.663 --> 13:53.769
interesting thing about oceanography is no one 
has ever argued the Mansfield Amendment in

13:48.663 --> 13:53.769
oceanography. Many of the people working in the 
Office of Naval Research in order to feel that

13:57.284 --> 14:11.423
their program is very solid, have changed titles 
and changed emphasis to make the amount of work

13:57.284 --> 14:11.423
they do more specific towards the acoustical side 
or the physical side. I think that this is a normal

14:12.285 --> 14:17.812
thing to occur when you take history and you go back 
far enough. The Navy was the major supporter of

14:17.852 --> 14:22.819
ocean science, basic science, basic research. 
Today, I forget the exact figures. We could look

14:24.440 --> 14:32.928
them up, but I think the Navy is just like about 25% 
of the national support, and the National Science

14:24.440 --> 14:32.928
Foundation is probably more like 40 or 45. NOAA, if 
you count the Sea Grant, is probably another 15,

14:33.428 --> 14:44.438
and then the states are probably another 10, and 
there's probably another 2% from industry or

14:33.428 --> 14:44.438
catch can. I think it is very clear, and I've had 
this argued and discussed, that at the policy

14:45.259 --> 14:52.485
level, the Navy has never exercised the Mansfield 
Amendment or felt it necessary in oceanography.

14:54.943 --> 14:58.991
It has in computer technology, electronics, 
nuclear physics, et cetera. And I think the reason

14:59.012 --> 15:04.323
that they don't in oceanography is probably the 
similarity of everything one does in the ocean.

15:05.044 --> 15:11.638
And I would characterize that as the single 
environment that I've run into in my lifetime that

15:05.044 --> 15:11.638
everything you do is a function of the 
environment. By that I mean, if you go into outer

15:13.412 --> 15:22.142
space, it's a step function of, let's be 
hypothetical about it, it's a step function of one

15:13.412 --> 15:22.142
atmosphere on Earth and zero atmospheres in 
space. If you go in the ocean, what is it, one

15:22.162 --> 15:25.547
atmosphere per 32 feet of salt water? Something 
like that, which means that if you go down to 1,000

15:26.428 --> 15:36.580
feet, it doesn't make a damn bit of difference 
whether you're tying up a Christmas tree or you're

15:26.428 --> 15:36.580
putting a surveillance station or you're 
listening to a listening device or you're putting

15:26.428 --> 15:36.580
a pipeline. The difficulty of doing the job is 
measured by the difficulty of the environment as

15:36.880 --> 15:42.828
opposed to the difficulty of the job. Many people 
will argue this, but I think those that have been at

15:42.888 --> 15:52.461
sea and tried to go down deep will concede that 
picking up pieces of the thresher is no different

15:42.888 --> 15:52.461
than picking up a manganese nodule. The only 
difference is if you ever get out of science and get

15:52.481 --> 16:03.816
into practical utilization, then you will 
specify a different system for picking up nodules

15:52.481 --> 16:03.816
than picking up pieces of pipe, for example, but 
the prototype or the research and development or

16:04.302 --> 16:08.146
the science necessary to do it are identical. The 
science doesn't know. I think a classic example is

16:09.968 --> 16:19.778
using the BTs, the temperature versus depth, for 
anti-submarine warfare and using it for location

16:09.968 --> 16:19.778
of tuna fish. And we have, as I'm sure you're aware, 
very quietly made arrangements with many of the US

16:19.798 --> 16:29.528
tuna fishing industries to jointly work with us. 
We have to be careful about this because they are

16:32.956 --> 16:39.385
perhaps as proprietary or as...

16:39.405 --> 16:45.694
They don't want other people to know what they're 
doing, just like an oil company doesn't, and I

16:39.405 --> 16:45.694
think even more so perhaps than the Navy. Now, is it 
fair to say then that in terms of reference to the

16:47.436 --> 16:58.191
Mansfield Amendment, that you feel as if Navy 
ought to be broad spread in terms of

16:47.436 --> 16:58.191
experimentation with oceanography? 
Absolutely. The only problem is that If you have

17:00.209 --> 17:07.968
only $30 million and you have $90 million worth of 
work to do, you have to put your $30 million towards

17:00.209 --> 17:07.968
the highest priority projects. And you can argue 
that there's no such thing as a high priority

17:07.988 --> 17:13.982
project in basic science, but that isn't quite 
true in oceanography. We do have weapon systems

17:14.350 --> 17:19.356
and ships and things already built that don't know 
how to be used in the ocean. They can be basically

17:19.396 --> 17:23.421
used, but you don't know how to use them to their 
maximum efficiency. We have weapon systems that

17:23.962 --> 17:35.036
we still could make them maybe 20, 30, 40, 50% more 
effective if we understood more about the

17:23.962 --> 17:35.036
physical processes in the ocean and so forth. Of 
course, the maps we use, the depth maps, which we

17:35.737 --> 17:43.767
use on occasion for navigational purposes, The 
more accurate we can make them, the better they are

17:44.219 --> 17:47.704
for navigational purposes. And of course, 
everybody in the ocean, whether you be a

17:47.744 --> 17:53.634
scientist, an engineer, or a developer, has got to 
have a map. And if you're working off the bottom,

17:53.654 --> 17:56.258
you better know what the bottom looks like. So the 
similarity here is so identical. I think an

17:59.423 --> 18:06.193
interesting thing that I was talking to the new 
undersecretary about just on the trip down to

17:59.423 --> 18:06.193
Mississippi, was something that I don't think 
that he recognized, and that is that

18:07.017 --> 18:35.775
interestingly enough in scientific 
oceanography, and by that I mean university

18:07.017 --> 18:35.775
oceanography, that the measurements made by the 
scientists are fed in real time directly to the

18:07.017 --> 18:35.775
computer the Navy runs at Fleet Numerical in 
Monterey and fed to the fleet because we are so

18:07.017 --> 18:35.775
lacking in knowledge of the ocean that we are in 
fact using basic science as an operational tool,

18:07.017 --> 18:35.775
which is not true in electronics, physics, 
mathematics, or the other things that the Office

18:36.127 --> 18:40.131
of Naval Research, for example, on the scientific 
side is involved in. And I don't know how to

18:40.152 --> 19:04.699
articulate this except that we don't yet have the 
mathematical model of the ocean, so we're still in

18:40.152 --> 19:04.699
the sort of wandering stage where we can derive 
beneficial results from an operational

18:40.152 --> 19:04.699
standpoint by just knowing what the temperature 
versus depth or temperature versus salinity or

18:40.152 --> 19:04.699
the estimated acoustical range or the sea state 
is, that we haven't gotten ourselves to a point

18:40.152 --> 19:04.699
where We don't have to rely on the basic science. 
And I have programs which, if you were looking at

19:07.842 --> 19:21.746
the measurement side of the program, you wouldn't 
be able to distinguish whether it was being done by

19:07.842 --> 19:21.746
Texas A&M or whether it was being done by the Bureau 
of Ordnance on the Mark Wasit weapon system. And

19:21.806 --> 19:28.297
one would be funded out of operational and 
maintenance money, which the Navy is very

19:21.806 --> 19:28.297
complicated with seven different congressional 
appropriations. The other one would be funded out

19:28.317 --> 19:30.180
of basic research money. And I think this has given 
us an advantage in oceanography, which many

19:31.055 --> 19:36.381
people call a disadvantage. But I think it's an 
advantage because we can even use warships to

19:36.401 --> 19:41.908
collect oceanographic information and data. And 
we're hoping to be able to computerize enough

19:42.909 --> 19:47.295
things and standardize. And again, to 
standardize not in an academic sense because

19:47.335 --> 19:55.244
academic people, when you use the word standard, 
get frightened or don't want to do it for one reason

19:47.335 --> 19:55.244
or another. But if you could standardize just 
instrumentation and calibration for routine

19:58.072 --> 20:05.884
types of measurements that all the scientists use 
and also the operators use, I think we'd be a lot

19:58.072 --> 20:05.884
better off. We're having problems in that arena, 
but I think the technology of computer technology

20:05.945 --> 20:18.004
and transmission via satellite and 
communications in general are without any

20:05.945 --> 20:18.004
question at a point in time where you can do this if 
you had the money to set it up. Now, speaking of

20:19.125 --> 20:23.252
standardizing, which we are in a different sort of 
way, is I think most people in, for lack of a better

20:24.110 --> 20:38.145
word, political oceanography, most people agree 
it was you who first standardized the

20:24.110 --> 20:38.145
oceanographic office here, a sense of bringing 
all aspects of naval oceanography into one

20:24.110 --> 20:38.145
central office. Would you agree with that? Well, 
let me say that I'm the one who first, not the one who

20:39.747 --> 20:47.035
first tried it, I probably was the one who was in a 
better position to get it started. I think Tex

20:47.656 --> 20:52.581
Treadwell was trying, I think everybody, Art 
Maxwell was trying, I think, The difference was I

20:53.253 --> 21:04.966
was sitting in the secretary's office, and the 
secretary was very interested in not

20:53.253 --> 21:04.966
standardizing but consolidating, I think is a 
better word, trying to get a critical mass without

20:53.253 --> 21:04.966
destroying everything. At the same time, you 
always can get a bureaucrat's interest by saying,

21:05.046 --> 21:12.574
I'm going to consolidate because he sees savings. 
We were not trying to make savings. We were trying

21:14.816 --> 21:16.678
to get more efficient programs. I think we have 
failed to consolidate the program. I think we're

21:20.922 --> 21:25.828
making another attempt right now to consolidate 
it in Mississippi, and I think it'll be five years.

21:25.888 --> 21:35.340
I think you will have finished your research 
project long before you can answer the question,

21:25.888 --> 21:35.340
is that attempt to consolidate going to be 
successful? The one up here was only maybe 25% or

21:35.860 --> 21:39.124
30% successful. All right, now, what I should like 
for you to do is to describe the way it operated

21:40.025 --> 21:46.733
before you took it over and what you had in mind how 
you wished for it to operate when you were through.

21:50.467 --> 22:00.397
Well, I'll have to go back to 1963 when I knew 
nothing at all about oceanography and walked into

21:50.467 --> 22:00.397
an office and suddenly discovered that we had lost 
a nuclear submarine the first time we'd ever lost

21:50.467 --> 22:00.397
one. We'd lost it with all hands on board, and I 
couldn't understand it. I couldn't understand

22:03.841 --> 22:13.851
why here we had a submarine in an operational area 
with a surface ship in complete communications

22:03.841 --> 22:13.851
with it, right with it, and didn't know where it 
went down exactly. Naval officers seem to think

22:14.607 --> 22:24.922
they know where they are at sea, and they don't have 
the foggiest damn idea as far as accuracy is

22:14.607 --> 22:24.922
concerned.

22:24.942 --> 22:27.906
By accuracy, I mean accuracy to be able to use your 
sensors. So all of a sudden here I have, I'm given

22:29.728 --> 22:35.917
the responsibility for the secretary, and of 
course this is an anomaly in the Navy. Why would we

22:35.937 --> 22:42.927
have a discipline in the Navy that in effect was 
managed from the office of the secretary of the

22:35.937 --> 22:42.927
Navy? That is different. To my knowledge, I could 
be wrong about that, but no intense bureaucratic

22:46.822 --> 22:58.213
management on any other field has been done by the 
Secretary, not even nuclear power. That was done

22:58.394 --> 23:01.757
by Admiral Rickover himself and outside the 
Secretary's office. He had some assistance

23:02.217 --> 23:08.383
initially, but the Office of Naval Research is 
legally managed by the Secretary, but not really.

23:08.423 --> 23:12.087
The Chief of Naval Research almost runs his 
program unhindered. The missile programs got

23:12.488 --> 23:20.555
secretarial attention because they needed it to 
get started, but then they were pretty much

23:12.488 --> 23:20.555
managed outside. The other program that got 
secretarial attention, I guess perhaps most

23:20.615 --> 23:29.303
notorious, was the Polaris program, and that was 
needed because the Navy had never done it. But then

23:29.363 --> 23:37.170
again, you had Admiral Rayburn and Levering Smith 
and Dr. Teller who made the contributions that

23:29.363 --> 23:37.170
really did the program. I think oceanography was 
never really accepted as... in the Navy as

23:43.758 --> 23:46.624
something that was absolutely necessary. 
Hydrography was accepted and the Naval

23:47.947 --> 24:04.382
Oceanographic Office, I believe, Ray Hagen can 
give you all of the actual searched history of what

23:47.947 --> 24:04.382
it went through, but it went through basically 
charting and it wasn't until I don't really

24:04.953 --> 24:10.444
consider it was until World War II when people 
really got in and called things oceanography.

24:10.464 --> 24:13.550
They'll say 1930, 31, 33, but really that's not 
true. Really, it was World War II, the submarine

24:13.610 --> 24:21.004
threat, the inability to understand why they'd 
see them sometimes and wouldn't other times. And

24:21.575 --> 24:23.157
that put Woods whole in the business. And I think 
there's an interesting thing that's never been

24:23.197 --> 24:29.705
true in another discipline, with the possible 
exception of the Manhattan Project when it first

24:23.197 --> 24:29.705
started. But in oceanography, it's continued. 
Here I walk into a field which I'm new. I mean, I had

24:33.529 --> 24:38.696
nuclear physics and mathematics, so from a novice 
scientific standpoint, I'm not a novice. But from

24:38.736 --> 24:41.179
a oceanography standpoint, I'm a novice. And I 
suddenly discover that the contributors to the

24:43.141 --> 24:49.749
location of the Thresher are not the operational 
Navy or not sort of engineering Navy. They're

24:50.570 --> 24:52.172
mostly basic research people. They're the 
academic people plus the Naval Research

24:52.352 --> 24:55.956
Laboratory. I mean, there are operations out 
there, but the people we are talking about. And

24:58.859 --> 25:07.950
then I think the thing that fascinated me was then 
to discover the next crisis that I personally

24:58.859 --> 25:07.950
faced, and I don't remember exactly the year, but 
circa 1966, we lost the The Air Force lost the

25:08.318 --> 25:10.703
hydrogen bomb off of Palomares. And I can honestly 
tell you that we received calls from every major US

25:11.264 --> 25:18.079
academic institution instantaneously. I didn't 
have to ask them for help. They were on my phone.

25:20.424 --> 25:21.766
Hey, Ed, what can we do to help? That's so unusual in 
an operational world. And operational by that, I

25:24.713 --> 25:27.238
don't necessarily confine myself to military, 
but even industrial world. Here you have an

25:30.530 --> 25:40.188
academic group that feels obliged to come 
forward, and not only feels obliged, but have

25:30.530 --> 25:40.188
better capability, in a sense, than the full 
operational Navy. And this was true in the

25:40.208 --> 25:43.213
Thresher case. Now, from the Thresher to the 
Palomares bomb, we'd started to move rather

25:43.233 --> 25:51.488
rapidly from an engineering viewpoint, and we had 
started to put significant more money into basic

25:51.907 --> 25:56.174
research, and we had started a major program for 
shipbuilding to build egg oars. And I think it's

25:56.815 --> 26:08.314
also very interesting to recognize that up until 
about four years ago, the Navy provided the only

25:56.815 --> 26:08.314
federally funded ships for the oceanographic 
programs in the universities. And the only reason

26:08.334 --> 26:13.362
we're not doing it now is not the Mansfield 
Amendment, but it's a very simple problem. The

26:13.382 --> 26:15.265
Navy lost so many ships stricken from the 
register, the cost of shipbuilding has gone up so

26:15.515 --> 26:38.645
much that the Navy's requirements are so severe, 
they just don't have the damn money to buy the ships

26:15.515 --> 26:38.645
they need like aircraft carriers, so there's 
nothing left over for things that you and I feel are

26:15.515 --> 26:38.645
important, but the man who's trying to fight 
today's battles hasn't got the money to put on the

26:15.515 --> 26:38.645
future, which I call the future of the country 
being the ability to exploit the ocean. But then

26:39.707 --> 26:45.454
I'm very parochial in that view, and I think most of 
us are who've worked in the program. Well, the last

26:46.345 --> 26:49.910
ship we built was the one that went to Texas, A&M. 
Last one funded by the Navy. And don't forget,

26:52.955 --> 26:55.899
these ships were not funded by Office of Naval 
Research. A lot of people think they were. These

26:56.901 --> 27:05.113
ships are funded by the Operational Navy, the same 
dollars that buy the combatant submarines and the

26:56.901 --> 27:05.113
combatant aircraft carriers and the combatant 
destroyers. And I fought this battle, and I lose in

27:06.375 --> 27:09.820
the dollar. I don't lose in principle, but I lose in 
the fact that when you get through today's world,

27:10.501 --> 27:15.188
you haven't the dollar left over. And I think it's 
bad, but then I don't know how I'd feel if I were the

27:16.653 --> 27:23.389
chief of naval operations with all the problems 
he's got on the shoulders.
