WEBVTT

00:02.950 --> 00:04.712
Which is that now?

00:05.834 --> 00:09.699
It's, I don't know what that bank is called now.

00:10.059 --> 00:10.459
University?

00:10.540 --> 00:11.881
Yeah, it's on University.

00:13.423 --> 00:27.221
And I had an office suite with Dr. Walter Juleff, who was kind enough to take me in and pay my expenses.

00:28.082 --> 00:29.143
And so

00:29.123 --> 00:37.855
I resided over there for a number of years and changed my directions to international activities.

00:38.257 --> 00:38.799
All right.

00:38.819 --> 00:39.742
And describe those.

00:39.963 --> 00:40.585
What were you?

00:41.105 --> 00:42.768
working on?

00:43.208 --> 01:01.257
Initially, I was asked by a Houston oil company who had a joint venture with a Russian oil company to provide them advice on

01:01.237 --> 01:24.426
Since I had degrees in agriculture and degrees in veterinary medicine and a degree from a medical school, they asked me to serve in advisory capacity to them in agriculture and veterinary medicine and medicine in the Republic of Twardistan.

01:24.406 --> 01:44.630
And so I began working in that republic for an oil company in Russia called Tatneft and set up some model programs and helped set up medical programs and agricultural research center and et cetera, et cetera.

01:45.551 --> 01:50.076
Were you doing that when the USSR broke up?

01:51.052 --> 02:02.300
I began my first trip and first relationship was just prior to the breakup.

02:03.182 --> 02:09.077
How did things change for an American when the USSR

02:09.057 --> 02:28.860
Well, you went from a from very totally central government to no government overnight, but Tartistan was the original republic that had most of the oil.

02:30.041 --> 02:31.403
It was just

02:31.383 --> 02:40.215
It was just east of Moscow, about 300 or so miles, but just right at the edge of the Volga River.

02:41.216 --> 02:52.252
And that republic, being primarily a Muslim republic, had always functioned fairly independently.

02:52.272 --> 02:56.918
And they had the major oil resources at that time.

02:56.898 --> 03:04.199
I saw very little change working out of that republic.

03:04.660 --> 03:12.342
So, as your task changed in the 90s, then you didn't teach any classes.

03:13.402 --> 03:16.665
How often did you come over to veterinary medicine?

03:17.886 --> 03:19.208
Oh, very, very little.

03:20.729 --> 03:28.997
All right, then did you, you didn't stay over there in that office forever, did you?

03:29.718 --> 03:39.527
No, well, while I was over in that office, I was still, even though I was not located at the college,

03:40.351 --> 03:55.460
given the charge to set up the 75th celebration for the College of Veterinary Medicine.

03:55.500 --> 03:56.622
Oh, describe that.

03:56.602 --> 04:07.440
And that was a very time-consuming thing and something that was probably—I may have made it too elaborate, but— When was that?

04:08.441 --> 04:14.391
Oh, that would have been in 90—I can't remember.

04:14.672 --> 04:19.740
Ten years ago, I was going to be there.

04:20.176 --> 04:25.761
Fifteen years from now, it'll be a hundred so.

04:25.861 --> 04:27.142
Yeah, it'll be a hundred.

04:27.162 --> 04:36.191
So that'd be... In 2013, I think, we'll be... Something like that, we'll be at a hundred, so you could go back from that.

04:36.211 --> 04:38.653
In 1993 to 91 every time frame.

04:38.673 --> 04:39.794
Yeah.

04:39.814 --> 04:40.635
And what did y'all do?

04:41.075 --> 04:48.242
Well, what I... The approach I took to it was...

04:49.167 --> 05:07.627
Dr. Shattuck wanted a great celebration, so it took me three years to get it organized and then to fulfill it.

05:08.968 --> 05:13.453
But we started out with

05:14.395 --> 05:17.863
trying to decide what we might want.

05:17.983 --> 05:27.285
And so at first I thought we'd just have maybe one session somewhere.

05:27.385 --> 05:32.016
But as it grew and as I contacted other schools,

05:32.907 --> 05:38.841
We started out, we had to develop a logo, and then we had to develop a piece of artwork.

05:39.703 --> 05:48.925
Then we had a book, a special kind of doctor that was put together, and then we had

05:48.905 --> 05:53.873
the paintings, we had prints made and had lots of things.

05:53.893 --> 06:02.087
And then I thought, well, who do we want to know about veterinary medicine?

06:02.147 --> 06:13.967
And I decided, well, we need the faculty and we need the students and we need the people of Texas and we need the veterinary practitioners and we need the legislative people.

06:13.947 --> 06:25.082
We need various facets of the people in Texas from agriculture to rural to urban and so forth.

06:25.142 --> 06:39.060
And so I eventually set up a celebration point at each month so that we interfaced with a different segment of society.

06:39.766 --> 06:47.182
And then, of course, we had the grand kickoff and we had the closure and all of those things.

06:47.203 --> 06:48.730
So it turned out to be a

06:49.368 --> 07:11.279
a pretty significant task and right now I'm doing the same thing for the Texas Veterinary Medical Association as they will celebrate their 100th year in 2003 and so I'm doing the same thing for them just now.

07:11.479 --> 07:14.143
Where will most of those events occur?

07:14.258 --> 07:18.829
Well, I'm going to use the same tact.

07:19.530 --> 07:32.520
I'll have a kickoff celebration here at College Station, and then I'll have activities at the Fort Worth and Houston and

07:33.226 --> 07:36.894
and San Antonio stock shows.

07:37.195 --> 07:45.013
We'll have things in the legislature or the rotunda and other things there.

07:45.033 --> 07:47.218
We will

07:47.637 --> 07:57.775
have activities at various organized groups in the state.

07:59.218 --> 08:11.620
We will have high school students

08:12.511 --> 08:19.801
participate in essay contests and such as that in order to give us their thoughts on veterinary medicine.

08:21.343 --> 08:24.768
We have special journal issues that will be produced.

08:26.050 --> 08:35.282
I'm trying to get a piece of artwork put together, which I have an artist working on.

08:37.145 --> 08:42.332
She is a Norman Rockwell artist.

08:42.667 --> 08:53.494
Tammy Bissett and she is putting us a Norman Rockwell type of painting together and it's going to be pretty exciting.

08:53.594 --> 08:55.258
Where will the original hang?

08:56.217 --> 09:08.339
Well, we'll probably somewhere here in the college, I imagine, or maybe in Austin at our headquarters, we'll probably bid that out to the highest bidder.

09:08.419 --> 09:18.377
The one at the 75th, I think, brought $1,000, but we will have probably 500 prints plus the original.

09:18.796 --> 09:20.159
we'll use those.

09:20.640 --> 09:24.709
This is going to cost us a couple hundred thousand dollars for this celebration.

09:26.072 --> 09:35.674
And anyhow, we'll do all those things and then I came up with an idea of

09:35.654 --> 09:41.932
of how we might make money for the Veterinary Medical Association.

09:41.992 --> 09:50.997
There's never been a book on veterinary medicine published for

09:50.977 --> 09:59.548
young people, say, in the age group three to eight or what have you.

10:00.048 --> 10:05.215
There's just never been a children's book published on the veterinary profession anywhere.

10:06.096 --> 10:15.668
So I found an author that does that kind of thing and has access to Barnes and Noble

10:16.306 --> 10:46.077
for distribution, and so we are now writing a children's book on veterinary medicine, and we expect that to be a group of sequel books about veterinarians, perhaps as a zoo veterinarian, as a small animal, as a large animal, as public health, as all the different facets that veterinarians carry out.

10:46.478 --> 10:49.241
Is the hope that these would be nationally marketed?

10:49.402 --> 10:52.626
These would be nationally marketed through Barnes & Noble.

10:53.987 --> 11:07.424
And there's a chance, I think, of there being a tremendous income from this for the association.

11:08.065 --> 11:09.927
We are getting copyrights.

11:11.549 --> 11:15.574
As I speak, we're writing a contract.

11:16.533 --> 11:38.598
During all of these years that you have been working in veterinary medicine, Texas Tech on occasion has made efforts to get a vet school, and I believe officially they received authority to have a veterinary program in the 70s, but never got any funding.

11:40.080 --> 11:45.426
What is your opinion about there being more than one vet program in Texas?

11:46.098 --> 12:14.367
That was, that approval came during Governor Smith's term, and he was a Tech graduate, and he pushed through the legislature a medical school, a school of nursing, and a veterinary school through the legislature, and Tech was recognized as

12:14.347 --> 12:19.697
is having the authority to offer education in those three areas.

12:21.120 --> 12:36.810
He got funding for the medical school, and he got funding for the school of nursing, and he even had facilities built for all three, a type of facility, not a complete facility.

12:37.988 --> 12:47.824
And the legislature, although it approved Veterinary College in Lubbock, it never did fund it.

12:47.844 --> 12:49.567
And that's been 30 years ago.

12:51.150 --> 12:57.280
And the issue has arisen once again.

12:58.475 --> 13:04.188
And there's just lots of political aspects to it.

13:04.208 --> 13:09.440
First, the coordinating board said they don't think that something approved 30 years ago is still valid.

13:11.986 --> 13:13.108
The Texas A.M.

13:13.325 --> 13:24.138
Veterinary College has established programs in West Texas, at Amarillo and different places, diagnostic labs.

13:24.158 --> 13:31.386
And be glad to establish other, we have diagnostic labs in South Texas and different, different East Texas and different places.

13:31.426 --> 13:33.208
And we'd be glad to put more in.

13:35.311 --> 13:40.197
The numbers of graduates are certainly sufficient to cover the state of Texas.

13:40.257 --> 13:42.960
We have the largest veterinary school in the country.

13:43.835 --> 13:52.691
The complaint seems to be that there are some counties that don't have enough veterinarians.

13:54.073 --> 14:06.535
And we found out a long time ago that we cannot force graduates into unpopulated counties

14:06.515 --> 14:12.404
where the economics will not support them.

14:12.424 --> 14:28.230
And wherever they build a veterinary school and wherever the graduates come from does not mean that they're going to go going back to rural practice in very sparsely populated counties.

14:28.250 --> 14:30.193
And there is

14:30.798 --> 14:41.491
certainly not enough funding for the present school, so why would we want to try to fund two schools?

14:41.511 --> 14:55.489
There are no other states that have two schools except one, and Tuskegee has got a school.

14:55.975 --> 14:59.538
And it was a minority black school.

15:01.180 --> 15:08.246
And most states, only about 25, 26 states have veterinary colleges.

15:08.626 --> 15:18.515
Now, one of the items talked about today by some East Texas representatives is for Tech to put its vet school over in East Texas.

15:19.196 --> 15:25.341
There is no veterinary program that is located geographically away from a university, is there?

15:26.755 --> 15:29.181
Oh, not that I'm aware of.

15:29.361 --> 15:38.402
There are some branches, but they're all affiliated with one university.

15:39.428 --> 15:50.229
During your years, women began in veterinary medicine here at A&M and on the faculty.

15:52.934 --> 15:57.302
Look back and generalize about the coming of women here.

15:57.362 --> 15:59.867
How smoothly did that occur?

16:00.742 --> 16:22.766
Well, the first student we had was back in 1960, let me see, about 1964, I think, something like that.

16:22.786 --> 16:24.588
60, huh?

16:24.929 --> 16:30.715
Graduated and came here in 63 or 64.

16:30.880 --> 16:49.467
And she was a very nice young lady, and her name was Sonya Oliphant, and she was from Poteet, Texas, and I always called her Miss Poteet.

16:49.547 --> 16:51.429
But she came in.

16:51.510 --> 16:53.192
There had been a number of

16:54.488 --> 16:57.932
women had tried to come into the professional curriculum.

16:57.952 --> 17:02.338
At that time, they all went to Oklahoma to school.

17:02.578 --> 17:23.365
And so as A&M became co-ed and are moving toward that, she came into the curriculum, did a very good job, was a good student, and has done well in practice.

17:23.345 --> 17:25.307
Do you know where she's practicing now?

17:25.767 --> 17:34.276
Yes, I tried to call her today, and it's out west somewhere.

17:34.356 --> 17:35.797
I'll have to look at my notes.

17:36.758 --> 17:41.743
When you do chat with her, tell her I would be pleased to interview her about her student days.

17:41.843 --> 17:42.164
Okay.

17:45.227 --> 17:48.370
Sonia, I know, would be happy to do that.

17:48.390 --> 17:51.613
I tried to call her this morning, and she was in surgery.

17:52.336 --> 17:55.709
And so I'll touch base with her this week sometime.

17:55.729 --> 17:58.701
What was the faculty's reaction to the admission of women?

17:58.748 --> 18:26.359
Well, some of the faculty were a bit concerned because some of them were a bit coarse in their presentations, but they all learned that that was not difficult to change somewhat their vocabulary.

18:27.638 --> 18:46.018
All in all, after the First Lady came, we began to get four, five, six, or seven, thirteen, and then presently about sixty-five percent of our students are

18:45.998 --> 18:57.681
are female, which probably out of 130 you can figure we've got almost 100, I guess, that are female.

18:58.463 --> 19:01.729
So, and then I guess

19:02.300 --> 19:17.953
The first faculty member we had was Dr. Bonnie Beaver, and then I hired a Dr. Coachever and a Dr. Merton.

19:17.973 --> 19:32.205
Dr. Coachever had a millstone around her neck in a way, and she was a Rice graduate.

19:33.215 --> 19:50.821
Of the first six or seven faculty we had, women faculty, were just outstanding, have been outstanding, have made major contributions to the college.

19:50.841 --> 20:00.555
Do you remember any incidents involving co-ed in the early years or female faculty?

20:01.936 --> 20:03.922
Never that I know of.

20:05.166 --> 20:07.493
What about black students?

20:08.115 --> 20:13.110
Well, we had our first black student back in

20:13.833 --> 20:16.176
I don't know when I had him in school.

20:16.196 --> 20:17.517
It was back in the 60s.

20:17.697 --> 20:22.222
A student named Courtney, I guess, I believe was his name.

20:23.584 --> 20:25.306
And he was from, he came.

20:26.527 --> 20:29.270
We used to have students that came in.

20:29.370 --> 20:31.873
We only took students from the state of Texas.

20:33.875 --> 20:43.266
And we had some that came in through various other ways.

20:43.482 --> 20:54.435
You could only become a resident of the state of Texas if you remained out of school for one year and worked full-time and supported yourself.

20:55.736 --> 21:07.670
And we had people that would do that come to Texas and work, support themselves, become a resident, and find their way into the curriculum.

21:10.454 --> 21:13.337
And the school is still fairly well

21:13.908 --> 21:17.226
pointed toward Texas residents.

21:18.211 --> 21:21.690
But Courtney was

21:22.379 --> 21:23.721
Graduated.

21:25.243 --> 21:25.944
From where?

21:27.466 --> 21:32.332
Well, he came to us, I think, out of California to Texas where he had worked.

21:32.352 --> 21:39.902
And then he graduated and I think may have gone back to California and then came back into Dallas or Fort Worth.

21:39.922 --> 21:44.809
And he died here about, oh, a few months ago.

21:45.295 --> 21:47.963
But he did his undergraduate degree in California, you think?

21:48.304 --> 21:49.387
I am not sure.

21:49.989 --> 21:50.792
I'm not sure.

21:51.133 --> 21:57.432
What was the, as far as you recall, what was the reaction of the faculty and the students to him?

21:57.935 --> 21:59.457
None whatsoever.

21:59.477 --> 22:00.078
No problems?

22:00.098 --> 22:01.199
No problem.

22:01.219 --> 22:14.175
I never will forget when I was president of the student body at the veterinary college, I was always doing things that were a bit different.

22:14.235 --> 22:16.498
Not on purpose, it just worked out that way.

22:16.518 --> 22:18.981
But one of my chores was to provide the

22:20.108 --> 22:27.699
the programs for the Veterinary Student Association.

22:28.440 --> 22:32.747
And as vice president, he did that.

22:33.347 --> 22:37.213
He had to line up 10 or 12 speakers a year.

22:38.595 --> 22:47.989
And so one time, the president of Prairie View A&M was a veterinarian.

22:49.673 --> 22:55.420
And so I thought, well, it'd be good if I brought him over as a speaker one evening.

22:56.802 --> 22:58.744
And I did.

22:58.764 --> 23:00.546
I invited him, and he came.

23:02.068 --> 23:08.776
It was the first black, I guess, that had ever been in the college in any way.

23:10.878 --> 23:14.803
Not many blacks are veterinarians because they don't have any

23:15.863 --> 23:19.989
any very little contact with veterinarians there growing up.

23:22.874 --> 23:27.320
So the president of Prairie View came.

23:27.380 --> 23:33.710
The meeting was, best I recall, started at 7 p.m.

23:35.833 --> 23:40.420
and the students were all assembled and no speaker.

23:40.400 --> 23:48.030
And at about 6.59, here came the speaker.

23:49.993 --> 23:53.337
And he came in.

23:53.838 --> 23:56.701
He made his presentation, which was excellent.

23:58.083 --> 24:05.513
Talked about his days of going through veterinary college at Tuskegee.

24:05.493 --> 24:15.684
his interest in veterinary medicine and how it led to his presidency and these many things.

24:16.625 --> 24:25.935
And then as soon as he finished his presentation, the students applauded him, standing ovation.

24:26.656 --> 24:29.779
He turned on his heel and left.

24:29.759 --> 24:58.365
and normally we had refreshments and everything thereafter, but he was that, he was the old generation of black that we were so, we were, the students were very happy to have him and see him, but he just, he just still probably didn't feel exactly, well, he just,

24:58.835 --> 25:11.540
He did that, not for himself, but for the students, I guess, because they really had never interacted with any black.

25:12.121 --> 25:19.155
Do you recall any specific recruitment efforts by veterinary medicine at Prairie View?

25:20.587 --> 25:21.308
By anybody?

25:21.628 --> 25:37.511
Well, we recruited, we had, we had people that went out recruiting all the time from junior colleges and high schools and used local practitioners for recruiting.

25:39.093 --> 25:48.687
And as time came and as we were admonished to, to begin looking at minority recruitment,

25:48.667 --> 25:52.736
We certainly prepared.

25:55.262 --> 26:06.388
It was hard to make contact because you didn't have very many blacks in 4-H or any of the related fields.

26:06.368 --> 26:08.812
You didn't have them as ag teachers.

26:08.872 --> 26:11.355
You didn't have them out as practitioners.

26:11.375 --> 26:13.198
So it was very, very difficult.

26:13.398 --> 26:16.382
And so through the years we tried.

26:16.422 --> 26:25.896
Now we have each summer we have a special program that brings in about 60

26:28.660 --> 26:32.544
minority students, highly qualified.

26:32.905 --> 26:43.878
And we spend, I believe it's four to six weeks here, learning science and veterinary medicine about veterinary medicine.

26:44.418 --> 26:52.928
But most of these people are such good students and so highly qualified that they are recruited all over the United States.

26:52.948 --> 26:54.069
Are those high school kids?

26:54.169 --> 26:54.850
High school.

26:54.870 --> 26:56.372
High school kids.

26:56.352 --> 27:02.571
So it's very difficult to get good minorities.

27:02.932 --> 27:10.615
There have been Hispanic students throughout the years, but has that number been comparatively small also?

27:11.152 --> 27:15.559
Yeah, it's been small, and it's never because of the qualifications.

27:15.720 --> 27:26.798
It's just really those that are very, very highly qualified go into medicine or into engineering or into law.

27:26.778 --> 27:46.395
and they're recruited by all 50 states, and we do not, we always have Hispanics in our veterinary classes, and always have, but not many.

27:46.415 --> 27:50.639
Has A&M ever had any international veterinary students?

27:50.659 --> 27:55.063
All the time we've had any international

27:55.381 --> 28:00.717
was probably in our intern and residency program.

28:02.755 --> 28:13.166
Describe during your years the admissions process for veterinary medicine and how it has changed.

28:13.186 --> 28:31.885
The selection process has been one that's been highly organized and it's been for many years it's been set up

28:31.865 --> 28:36.394
on somewhat of a formula basis.

28:36.414 --> 28:39.861
Everybody had aptitude tests.

28:39.881 --> 28:42.867
They had class standing.

28:42.907 --> 28:48.117
They had to show interest in veterinary medicine.

28:49.320 --> 28:53.468
Most of them had a little background or experience in veterinary medicine.

28:54.123 --> 28:59.704
They had to have a good pre-vet record, a great point average.

29:01.833 --> 29:05.567
And now, through the years, they have developed a very

29:06.104 --> 29:26.793
a precise formula for coming in, which includes your overall grade point average, your last three grade point average for the last three semesters, your graduate record exam score, your letters of recommendation.

29:27.514 --> 29:34.103
But most of it is based on your high school graduating grades.

29:34.083 --> 29:41.284
Most of it is based on strictly on quantitative criteria.

29:42.768 --> 29:48.143
And so that we

29:49.760 --> 30:05.684
I don't have it for this year, but most of our students come in with a grade point average of better than 3.5 and GRE score of up 12, 1250 or something like that.

30:06.285 --> 30:11.312
As far as you know, during all the years of

30:11.596 --> 30:13.738
your service in veterinary medicine.

30:14.339 --> 30:20.546
The committee has been made up of experienced members of the faculty.

30:20.586 --> 30:22.769
Are there some non-faculty?

30:23.249 --> 30:35.043
Yeah, there are some non-faculty and even some non-veterinarians that are invited to participate in this selection process.

30:36.064 --> 30:39.308
The thing about selection to the college

30:39.743 --> 30:51.559
And the one that I guess I'm most proud of is I've never known a student to be selected in this college because of any political pressures.

30:52.332 --> 30:55.857
In fact, I'd say that's a negative factor.

30:56.979 --> 31:13.142
And there have been pressures put on by legislative people, governors, and everyone else, but I've never known of a person that was ever received on that basis.

31:14.164 --> 31:16.247
Now, many colleges have
