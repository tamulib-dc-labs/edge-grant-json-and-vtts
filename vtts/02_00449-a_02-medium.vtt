WEBVTT

00:01.229 --> 00:11.100
Well, the Command General of Staff College behind 
your record says, in your record, said, man, we

00:01.229 --> 00:11.100
wish we had more like this General Franklin. And he 
was good. He was good to me. He was the best active

00:14.363 --> 00:21.210
Army General other than General Powell that I 
could say helped the Reserves. And I went over and

00:22.932 --> 00:25.515
took over command. And I made some changes there. 
Now tell me, yeah, tell me about... First tell me

00:31.250 --> 00:33.353
about this petroleum intersection. What does 
that mean? All these designations, what do they

00:35.156 --> 00:37.459
mean? And this is in 1971? That's right. 1970. 
1970. 1970. And you were deactivated in 71, then?

00:46.172 --> 00:46.592
Or when? That's right. That's right. That's 
right. I had a unit about a year. You had the unit for

00:50.718 --> 00:52.100
about a year. Yeah, a little more than a year, I 
guess. Late 69, 1970, I took over the unit. And I

00:58.189 --> 01:00.733
went up there, and the acting commander was an 
administrative assistant named Plunkett,

01:01.237 --> 01:06.443
Colonel Plunkett. He was the acting commander, 
full colonel. And he was a civil servant. We called

01:15.595 --> 01:17.277
him administrative assistants. He was on civil 
service. He was paid full-time job for him. That

01:26.168 --> 01:27.490
was his job, livelihood. And that kind of brussel 
me a little bit because I couldn't see a civil

01:30.177 --> 01:38.305
servant man being a commander of a unit like that. 
No, I mean, it didn't make sense, that's right. So I

01:42.729 --> 01:48.094
went in there, and he was a colonel, and I'm a 
colonel. So after I was there for a weekend, a whole

01:49.476 --> 01:59.125
week, I was there three days, one Friday, 
Saturday, and Sunday. And I had the option. to

02:01.092 --> 02:13.563
either make him my exec officer or declare him 
excess and put him, remove him from the slot and

02:01.092 --> 02:13.563
make him a excess officer. But he worked full time 
for the reserve unit. Now you understand in the

02:17.246 --> 02:20.349
reserve unit they have these full time employees. 
Well that's what he was. I asked him to type a letter

02:22.791 --> 02:25.013
for me while I was there. He couldn't type it, 
didn't know how to type. And I said to myself, how in

02:27.715 --> 02:30.998
the world this guy became a full colonel 
administrative assistant who doesn't know how to

02:31.450 --> 02:33.312
type. Then I found out that he really, in my 
estimation, wasn't capable of being a colonel. He

02:41.659 --> 02:42.881
just wasn't. So I removed him from my... How did he 
become? I don't know. Well, he and the general

02:46.164 --> 02:50.848
before him, I found out later, were really 
buddies. So it was a buddy system that got him as far

02:52.229 --> 02:54.932
as he got. And that unit has never passed an IG 
inspection. Always busted it. And so I was told

03:03.860 --> 03:10.228
this by the Army commander, a deputy Army 
commander, and he said, get out there and

03:03.860 --> 03:10.228
straighten it out. And so

03:11.550 --> 03:16.516
I did. I removed him as, yeah, I'm always removing 
guys. I removed him as Executive Austin. I moved up

03:22.564 --> 03:29.352
a Lieutenant Colonel John, moved him into the 
slot. And I shifted some of the others around. And

03:32.853 --> 03:37.559
next thing I knew, we had an IG inspection and 
passed it with flying colors. Another thing, this

03:38.600 --> 03:44.288
unit had the highest divorce rate of any Army 
Reserve unit I know of. Really? And you asked, your

03:44.529 --> 03:47.453
question is, what's divorce? Why are you getting 
the divorces? Because I was told when I got there by

03:49.476 --> 03:58.528
the staff, they said, Colonel, all our people are 
getting divorces. and leaving the unit. I said,

04:00.825 --> 04:03.788
well now, what's the problem? He said, we don't 
know. I said, let me look at your schedule. OK.

04:07.151 --> 04:15.919
Terry, they were meeting on a weekend and two 
Tuesday nights, a month, and two Tuesday nights

04:07.151 --> 04:15.919
without pay. And the whole unit was out there, not 
the staff. They

04:18.942 --> 04:24.447
weren't at home very much. So they weren't home at 
all. So I said, OK. At the end of my first meeting, I

04:29.423 --> 04:36.891
assembled the whole unit, about 160 people, in 
this headquarters. Not counting the outlying

04:37.732 --> 04:39.533
units that I had. I assembled them, and I says, as a 
new commander, we're not going to have any more

04:40.655 --> 04:50.805
weekday meetings. And we're going to have one 
weekend a month, and you're going to get paid for

04:51.806 --> 04:56.551
all these meetings. Anytime we have a meeting, 
you're going to get paid for it. So you can make your

04:58.769 --> 05:07.140
plans now to meet once a month, and it'll be the 
third weekend of the month. And when I got through

05:08.561 --> 05:12.807
talking, I got the biggest rousing yell I ever 
heard in my life. Hey, Friday's your commander. I

05:15.490 --> 05:17.773
mean, recruits, enlisted men doing it. You know, 
some of the coming of them. So I kind of laughed and

05:20.577 --> 05:22.159
walked away. Well, after that, there were no more 
divorces. Seriously. No more, well, except the

05:26.564 --> 05:28.607
normal divorces. but it was because Plunkett had 
been calling his people out just you know on his own

05:28.925 --> 05:55.742
will and then hell the wives and husbands were 
fighting and so after that it was alright unless it

05:28.925 --> 05:55.742
really raised morale oh it really it did it I did a 
lot of other things too I went around to the

05:28.925 --> 05:55.742
sections and visited with them and promoted some 
people who should have been promoted a long time

05:28.925 --> 05:55.742
ago and I and

05:28.925 --> 05:55.742
I Moved people into different rooms, officers, 
and gave them better accommodations. And then I

06:01.610 --> 06:10.158
went to the Sandia base commander and told him that 
our accommodations, our facilities were

06:01.610 --> 06:10.158
terrible and needed better facilities. And so we 
got them.

06:15.143 --> 06:16.524
We went to Alaska for training. No kidding. Went up 
there for two weeks. And that's where I met General

06:21.248 --> 06:25.172
Hollingsworth.

06:27.245 --> 06:31.569
I can't remember right now, Terry, but I had 
problems with Colonel Pluckett.

06:35.634 --> 06:43.342
See, he was always fighting against me because he 
was dissatisfied because he didn't get the

06:35.634 --> 06:43.342
command.

06:47.106 --> 06:50.069
And so he would try to work against me. And we got to 
Alaska. About the third day, I removed him. from

06:57.873 --> 07:03.060
his job, and I went to see Hollingsworth. And I 
said, I need a plane ticket for one of my officers.

07:07.487 --> 07:11.493
I'm sending him

07:07.487 --> 07:11.493
home. And he was a two-star general. And I told him I 
need to send him home. And he laughed. He says, my

07:20.445 --> 07:22.969
goddammit. You got the money. You got the ticket. 
You can send him home. But why don't you just sit him

07:27.582 --> 07:30.166
on his butt and just let him sit? Why waste your 
money in sending him home now? I said, OK. I'll do

07:35.794 --> 07:36.355
that. So he says, send him over here, and we'll get 
him out of your way. So I did. I sent him over there.

07:44.967 --> 07:52.858
And

07:44.967 --> 07:52.858
Hollingsworth gave me the finest fishing report I 
ever got in my life. Really? He really, he saw me

07:54.505 --> 07:59.151
working. And he just was marveled. And he was proud 
that a Texas, an Aggie, would step in and just be as

08:02.055 --> 08:14.471
firm and strong and do a job as good as I could do. And 
hell, that shaped this unit up more. The dress was

08:18.497 --> 08:20.519
immaculate. And the military courtesies were 
just superb. And I just, you know, I really, and he

08:24.560 --> 08:27.624
was so proud. And he would, he called his staff 
here, his own people, and presented me to the

08:29.305 --> 08:35.473
staff. He says, I want you to meet the finest damn 
commander that I've ever, yeah, that I've ever

08:35.493 --> 08:40.959
met. And he said, look, he's got the Silver Star and 
the Purple Heart, and he was a forward observer in

08:41.480 --> 08:48.388
the Bulge, and he's back home alive. He says, we're 
so proud of him, and, and, uh. When we left, we had a

08:53.720 --> 08:58.505
banquet and invited he and all his staff. That guy 
was just, he just praised. We ran the pipeline. I

09:04.451 --> 09:05.172
forgot to tell you. What we'd do, we'd unload the 
oil. Yeah, what is it, a petrol intersection on

09:07.074 --> 09:09.316
Manhattan? That's right. Let's get to that. The 
Army has a pipeline in Alaska, 600 miles. No

09:14.741 --> 09:15.222
kidding. Not one drop of oil has ever been spilled. 
You know how they talk about the environment, you

09:19.646 --> 09:22.309
know, they're all... Well, that's tremendous. 
They would come into a little town. A ship would

09:26.437 --> 09:33.403
come into

09:26.437 --> 09:33.403
Alaska, unload it, put it in the tanks. Then we'd go 
to the tank, and we'd put it in the pipeline and take

09:33.723 --> 09:41.851
it up to Fairbanks, Alaska, and to the 
distribution point. And we ran the oil up there.

09:44.393 --> 09:49.258
And we monitored the pipeline and kept the oil 
going. Hollingsworth, General Hollingsworth,

09:51.584 --> 10:01.955
would give all the people who ran the pipeline, and 
they were civil servants, give them all vacations

09:51.584 --> 10:01.955
while we come up here and run the pipeline for them. 
Oh, yeah. We would perform a good service for them.

10:05.759 --> 10:17.532
And so all along the pipeline, they had little 
stations, and people, three or four, a family

10:05.759 --> 10:17.532
would live at a station. Maybe two families or 
three families lived at these pumping stations. I

10:22.465 --> 10:25.709
would take my chaplain, and they never thought 
about it before. I said, now, chaplain? He asked me

10:27.651 --> 10:29.634
when he got there, he said, what am I going to do, 
Colonel? I said, chaplain, I want you to get your

10:29.934 --> 10:36.482
jeep, and I want you to go up to Fairbanks, 600 miles 
away. And the two weeks you're here, I want you to go

10:37.383 --> 10:41.267
down the pipeline and conduct services for all 
those people. And a lot of them hadn't seen a priest

10:42.529 --> 10:48.456
or preacher in months, and he did. And he conducted 
services for all the people along the pipeline.

10:52.896 --> 10:54.118
That's a great idea. Oh, it's real hollingsworth 
to Dad. He couldn't believe it. And the people

10:59.244 --> 11:01.327
along the pipeline just loved it. Yes, you know. 
And they would spend a day or two with him. You know,

11:06.274 --> 11:08.336
they wouldn't just come in for an hour or two and go. 
They would stay a day and conduct

11:08.376 --> 11:18.289
regular Bible lessons with him, conduct 
services, whatever denomination they were. Some

11:18.309 --> 11:18.730
of them. I think he told me he ran across a couple of 
Greek Orthodox. I said, what, did you do your cross

11:21.198 --> 11:22.960
the right way? You know, the Grand Catholic and 
Greek Orthodox are different crosses. But

11:28.687 --> 11:31.251
anyway, and Hollingsworth just loved it. Anyway, 
we left, and he praised us and told us, you know,

11:31.691 --> 11:38.019
we've got lots of good places. Why were you only 
there in this unit for a year? They deactivated the

11:40.543 --> 11:43.486
unit. Department of the Army said they didn't need 
it in their inventory anymore. So they

11:49.085 --> 11:58.796
deactivated it, and instead of a general slot, 
general position, they made it a full colonel

11:49.085 --> 11:58.796
slot. So were you sort of out of a job then? I was kind 
of dangling, because my name had been presented to

12:03.121 --> 12:11.551
the Senate for promotion to general. In other 
words, you were still a colonel. I was still a

12:13.513 --> 12:14.474
colonel. You were in sort of, I see. Yeah, I was 
still a colonel, but my name Had to go to the Senate

12:19.730 --> 12:26.177
and then to the president to be okay. And of course, 
before you become a general, it goes through all

12:27.178 --> 12:33.025
kinds of boards. Fifth Army Board and then TRADOC 
training division, training command. Not

12:43.717 --> 12:46.120
TRADOC, CONARC, Continental Army Commander. Go 
through there and then And you're in competition

12:49.362 --> 12:51.944
with others for the same job. So they have to send in 
three colonels for a Brigadier General slot. And

12:58.471 --> 13:00.633
so finally I got selected. The Department of the 
Army selected me to be, they called me Brigadier

13:01.474 --> 13:07.299
General Designee. And that was a big step. Once I 
got that step, then I had the title, Brigadier

13:10.883 --> 13:18.610
General Designee, which I could occupy any 
general slot.

13:20.395 --> 13:23.658
Then the Department of the Army came out and said, 
we're going to deactivate the unit. We don't need

13:23.938 --> 13:24.859
it anymore. What did you think of that time? I was 
sick. I bet you that meant you probably thought

13:27.821 --> 13:31.464
that you would stay current. Yeah, I was, you know, 
what am I going to do? Well, I got a call from General

13:33.846 --> 13:35.548
Franklin. He says, come see me. So I went to see him. 
He says, now, Mike,

13:41.593 --> 13:49.660
we're very, let me show you what he said. very much 
extremely, he kind of got me, very much extremely

13:50.686 --> 13:57.695
pleased with your performance. You are a general 
officer material, and we're going to give you a

13:57.715 --> 14:04.084
general officer slot. I said, don't you worry. 
You've got a general officer slot. I said, fine. He

14:11.413 --> 14:13.656
says, now there's three openings.

14:18.226 --> 14:27.060
the Engineer Brigade in Bryan, Texas, a Brigadier 
General slot at the 75th Maneuver Area Command. So

14:29.123 --> 14:30.705
we're getting back to General Davis now. And we're 
going to activate a deputy commander slot with the

14:31.847 --> 14:42.703
90th ARCOM, 90th Army Reserve Command. It's a 
reserve command headquarters. that controlled

14:46.137 --> 14:52.404
lots of reserve units, 35, 40 units, small units. 
Now he says there's three of them. Located in this

14:55.008 --> 14:55.869
area? San Antonio, Texas. Located in Fort Sam 
Houston. Now the engineer brigades at Bryan and

14:59.753 --> 15:03.458
the other ones at Yale. So he says,

15:03.478 --> 15:08.483
which one would you like to have? Really? That's 
fantastic. This guy, this General Franklin, he

15:13.509 --> 15:15.672
says, And he really makes you feel good. You don't 
know how. Which one would you like to have? What

15:21.999 --> 15:22.779
would you want? Which job would you like to have? 
That's fantastic advice. It really gets you. Why

15:30.947 --> 15:33.289
did you decide on the 90th? The Army of Command. And 
why did you decide as the deputy instead of the

15:36.031 --> 15:41.976
commanding officer in two other positions? 
Right.

15:45.199 --> 15:46.620
That went through my mind. And

15:47.309 --> 16:00.149
the 90th command slot kind of appealed to me 
because General Travis was the commander. So I

16:02.353 --> 16:10.526
knew in a couple years he would retire and then I 
could step up. That's the normal procedure. And if

16:13.533 --> 16:17.200
I went to the 75th Command, I would be with General 
Davis. And you know, he didn't, wasn't too crazy

16:17.801 --> 16:21.968
about it because he had his own men over there. And 
Hayden, and Concordall, and they were all

16:23.611 --> 16:28.460
buddy-bud. And then, Bryan, Texas, Engineer 
Brigade.

16:37.816 --> 16:39.077
You didn't have much experience. I didn't have any 
experience in engineering. I wasn't an engineer.

16:42.761 --> 16:46.285
And I said, well, I'll just take the... So I told 
Jennifer, I said, I'll take the San Antonio job. He

16:51.870 --> 16:53.192
says, oh, I forgot to tell you. He says, General 
Travis is going to retire, and we're going to take

16:53.212 --> 17:04.583
Brigadier General Warren Myers, who I knew very 
well, and bring him out of control group and make

16:53.212 --> 17:04.583
him the commander. I said, okay, fine, I know 
Warren well. We served together 9th Division,

17:07.957 --> 17:12.543
Oklahoma. And I said, oh sure. So I took over the 
90th, so I was assigned the 90th Deputy Commander

17:15.987 --> 17:22.574
slot. And Myers was a commander, and we both went in 
as Brigadier Generals, and both went in at the same

17:22.594 --> 17:28.781
time. And at the first, we were good friends. And we 
stayed friends. Except he hadn't been with troops

17:37.220 --> 17:42.407
for five, six years. And he didn't know how to 
really command the 90th. And he relied on my

17:49.637 --> 17:57.167
judgment and my advice to command it, which is 
fine. He had his office, and I had my little office.

18:00.671 --> 18:03.595
And we worked very well. A lot of things he did, I 
didn't particularly thought it was a proper thing

18:04.958 --> 18:10.503
to do. But anyway, he was the commander. And so I 
went along with him. And he would ask me different

18:16.248 --> 18:21.452
advice, and I'd give it to him, and he would accept 
it. But then it got to a point, Terry, where he

18:23.614 --> 18:27.778
played a lot of politics. Really upset me. In what 
sense? Well, he began to move staff around and

18:33.578 --> 18:37.522
wasn't capable. He wasn't a strong commander at 
all. We had some people in the civil servant

18:41.425 --> 18:50.593
positions that we should have got rid of a long time 
ago, and he wouldn't do it. And since he lived in San

18:52.055 --> 18:54.937
Antonio and they lived in San Antonio, they became 
buddy-buddy. He buddy-bud too much with his

18:54.957 --> 19:02.404
staff, the lower echelon staff. And even some of 
the listed men. But anyway, that didn't deter my

19:06.111 --> 19:12.580
determination to do a good job. I went to San 
Antonio every Monday for four years. Never missed

19:18.307 --> 19:19.389
a Monday. I would go Monday at noon and drill Monday 
night and come back Tuesday noon. Drive all the

19:26.458 --> 19:27.880
way. And I told General Myers, I said, General 
Myers, everybody that I know of, is going to

19:33.468 --> 19:35.630
weekend drills. I said, no, I think we ought to go 
to, I think we can get more out of it. I says, I don't

19:42.617 --> 19:52.968
mind driving back and forth, but I think the 
weekend drill, multiple drill, we called them in,

19:42.617 --> 19:52.968
would mute us, would be the thing for us to do. And 
no, sir, he wouldn't do it. Well, about that time,

19:58.453 --> 20:02.918
after about a year, When I took over, we had a big 
drug problem throughout the Regner Army. And so

20:11.590 --> 20:18.800
the reserve began to get active in the drug 
problem. So he asked me to be the drug officer and

20:18.820 --> 20:25.328
set up a plan for the 90th Army Reserve Command. And 
we had about 26 units then. They eliminated some

20:29.390 --> 20:32.273
units, and we wound up about 26 units. And we had 
approximately how many men? 5,000 men. 5,000 men.

20:36.436 --> 20:37.417
5,000 reservists. Reservists. All scattered all 
over Texas and New Mexico and up in Sweetport,

20:38.018 --> 20:43.323
Louisiana. Anyway, I became the drug and alcohol 
abuse officer for the 90th Archive. So they sent me

20:51.330 --> 20:55.213
to school at the University of Oklahoma. It was a 
10-day school. And I was the ranking officer in the

20:58.188 --> 21:00.991
class. By that time, I got promoted to Brigadier 
General. So he got promoted to two stars, and I was

21:04.935 --> 21:07.878
one star. And then this schooling was not only 
Reservists or National, but Active Army people,

21:07.898 --> 21:16.167
about 60 of us. When I came back, I organized a plan 
for the 9th ARCOM that was the model plan for all the

21:24.067 --> 21:26.550
reserve units in the United States. No kidding? 
Tell me about that plan. Well, I emphasized

21:29.154 --> 21:36.663
physical fitness programs for the people and the 
reserves. They had people coming from all over the

21:36.803 --> 21:49.019
reserve from the commands from all over the United 
States to come look at our plan and see what we had.

21:49.039 --> 21:52.183
And the Army commander commended me for it. Myers 
has yet to commend me for it. Then I began to sense a

21:56.744 --> 22:01.410
little jealousy there, right after that. And what 
else besides physical fitness? Well, we had,

22:06.977 --> 22:17.731
instead of the medical doctors coming in and 
talking, I asked for psychiatrists to come in and

22:06.977 --> 22:17.731
talk. It was that type of program. And we had rap 
sessions among the people who were indulged in

22:20.412 --> 22:30.182
using dope, marijuana especially. And

22:31.003 --> 22:36.248
all the units, we sent it down to all the units. 
Well, the main thing I think they recognized, we

22:37.429 --> 22:46.878
began to tell them about the dope problem, you 
know, and alcohol. We had classes, we had

22:47.779 --> 22:50.402
lectures. And I would visit with them, you know, 
and the emphasis came down from the top, strong.

22:57.796 --> 23:01.460
And believe it or not, we did not have a problem. We 
didn't have any kind of problem in the reserve

23:01.661 --> 23:03.924
program.

23:06.747 --> 23:09.971
Except in Albuquerque. After I left, Plunkett 
became the commander. General Myers put him in

23:14.557 --> 23:17.601
there. Then they had a load. that had a little dope 
problem about a year later. And then we had the plan

23:22.347 --> 23:24.409
and we cleared all that up. The alcohol, it wasn't 
prevalent. There wasn't no problem in the

23:28.234 --> 23:29.796
reserve.

23:34.742 --> 23:40.028
Prior to that, these are secrets, shall I tell you 
secrets? Yeah. We know how to get rid of them on the

23:42.511 --> 23:44.673
tape when you read it.

23:48.378 --> 23:48.638
I don't know. Let me tell you something. Well, 
General Myers. You don't have to tell me anything

23:51.776 --> 23:55.641
about the personnel, but tell me about the Army. 
Well, General Myers told me, he said, General

23:56.062 --> 24:08.056
Travis stepped aside two years from retirement to 
let him take over, and when it came time for me to be

23:56.062 --> 24:08.056
promoted, he would step aside. But he never did. 
Which I didn't ask for it. I didn't care if he would

24:14.083 --> 24:17.848
step aside or not, you know. didn't make me any 
difference. But Myers disappointed me as one of

24:20.136 --> 24:27.887
the, he's one of the generals that really 
disappointed me in his performance. Well, how'd

24:27.907 --> 24:29.268
you get out of there? Okay, I stayed there. As the 
deputy, and how did you go to the commander of the

24:30.330 --> 24:34.215
75th? Okay, after about four years in the 9th 
ARCOM,

24:34.896 --> 24:45.270
General The Deputy Army Commander, General 
Rutan, we became friends. Because I used to come, I

24:53.844 --> 25:00.795
used to go to Fort Sam and go down to the track and gym 
and work out before I went to the meetings. And he

25:00.815 --> 25:05.922
found out I was a handball player and wanted to play 
handball, so we played handball and then

25:00.815 --> 25:05.922
racquetball. Actually, we became friends. There 
was an opening that came up in the 75th Mac. General

25:11.771 --> 25:13.654
Davis was retiring. And he wanted to know if I 
wanted to move down there. And I said, yes, I would.

25:19.179 --> 25:21.301
So I moved into the 75th MAC. And when I did, they

25:22.402 --> 25:41.438
reorganized the MAC and split it up into three 
units, command headquarters, and then combat

25:22.402 --> 25:41.438
support, no, combat service support, and combat 
arms. I took over as commander of the combat arms

25:41.458 --> 25:44.721
division. and I went in and reorganized the 
structure and was commander two years and I

25:45.106 --> 26:04.204
retired there at 75th and Mack.

26:04.224 --> 26:09.169
Was that, would you consider that as far as your 
reserve career the highlight of your career? Or

26:09.189 --> 26:12.632
what would you consider the highlight of your 
career as far as a reserve officer?

26:21.202 --> 26:32.171
I would, yeah, I think that was a highlight of my 
career because I went to the 75th MAC as a general

26:21.202 --> 26:32.171
officer. It's the first time that any outsider of 
the 75th MAC became a general officer. There's

26:40.018 --> 26:43.901
always, in the 75th MAC, they were inbred.

26:47.104 --> 26:51.107
And I went over there with resistance from the 
commander and the other general officer. Was the

26:54.321 --> 26:55.542
commander a two-star? Yes. Of

26:58.425 --> 27:05.211
course, they wanted to promote their own. I can 
understand that. But that was one of the reasons

27:07.213 --> 27:14.840
why General Rutan asked me to go down there is 
because there was too much inbreeding going on and

27:07.213 --> 27:14.840
the unit was low. It was bad, bad shape. And they 
wanted to reorganize it. And he wanted me to to

27:21.412 --> 27:22.573
being part of it. And of course, I was about ready 
then, because I was tired of going back and forth

27:23.995 --> 27:29.861
saying I'm used to it. And I couldn't see if it was 
once a month would be OK. So I went down there. And

27:36.609 --> 27:44.618
for about three or four months, it wasn't an easy 
job, Terry, even as a general officer. What were

27:46.437 --> 27:47.938
the problems? A lot of resistance? Well, a lot of 
resistance and a lot of cliques and here I come from

27:49.099 --> 27:53.523
the outside. Even though everybody knew me. I'm 
sure you'd been there before. I'd been there

27:56.786 --> 28:08.657
before and my record, I mean, you know, throughout 
Fifth Army area everybody knew what I had done in

27:56.786 --> 28:08.657
Albuquerque and what I'd done at Fort Sam Houston.

28:12.520 --> 28:14.402
So everybody knew me but I reorganized the combat 
arms division of the 75th MAC, and the active army

28:15.445 --> 28:39.718
advisor, Colonel Spencer, was just, he couldn't 
believe the

28:15.445 --> 28:39.718
accomplishment of what I was doing in comparison 
to the combat service support side. So he could

28:39.738 --> 28:44.524
compare, and we were head and shoulders above it. 
And

28:45.027 --> 28:56.580
my deputy,

28:45.027 --> 28:56.580
Harry Conrad, is now a Brigadier General in the 
MAC. And I recommended him to the job. Over six

28:59.544 --> 29:04.890
colonels who outranked him and who'd been there 
longer than he has. And Army bought my

29:06.732 --> 29:09.455
recommendation. So he'll be, I guess he'll be the 
eventual commander in another year over there.

29:15.706 --> 29:21.454
But that was a good duty. I went to the field a lot, to 
Fort Lewis, Washington, Camp DeBispo in

29:21.474 --> 29:37.897
California, Wisconsin, Fort

29:21.474 --> 29:37.897
McCoy. Traveled all over the United States 
putting on these maneuvers and exercises.

29:46.435 --> 29:49.558
was got the Legion of Merit for doing it. Really? 
Yeah. Did you expect that? No, I didn't expect it.

29:57.786 --> 29:58.707
The Army gave it to me. They gave it to me when I 
retired two years and said because of my work

29:59.868 --> 30:09.878
in the Maneuver Area Command.

30:13.361 --> 30:15.463
Oh yeah, I look back over at the Ninth ARCOM? I was 
sort of an advisor to all the people in the reserve.

30:23.561 --> 30:27.966
They all come to me with their problems and 
everything, the colonels and lieutenant

30:23.561 --> 30:27.966
colonels. And one of them in particular was chief 
of staff named Bob Lane. He was a full colonel. And

30:33.752 --> 30:43.982
he came to me and he says, General Kokonos, I'm 
going to transfer out and go to a direct support

30:33.752 --> 30:43.982
group that was meeting in New Brunswick. I said, 
what are you going to do over there? He said, I'm

30:46.422 --> 30:52.729
going to be the deputy, and they told me I could take 
over the command later on. I said, well, Bob, let me

30:52.749 --> 30:56.514
tell you what you do. You stay right here. Don't you 
move out. Why? He said, well, you may become one of

31:02.080 --> 31:09.629
the generals in this, because I'm going to retire, 
and so is General Miles. Oh, no, no, I need to go over

31:09.649 --> 31:12.692
and get command experience. Well, he was right. He 
hadn't had any command experience. But anyway, he

31:15.620 --> 31:19.085
said, okay, I'll listen to you. I'll stay. So he 
stayed. He's now a two-star general commanding

31:22.691 --> 31:29.861
the 9th Air Command.

31:29.881 --> 31:30.102
Oh, really? Yeah. Yeah. And I feel like that I was 
part of him getting that job. Oh, yeah. If he'd have

31:34.789 --> 31:38.174
moved out, he would have never been made general. 
There was no way he could get general. Because you

31:40.197 --> 31:44.243
have to be in the command channel or in a command 
channel. leading to the chop i did it the hard way i

31:44.830 --> 32:13.808
did it the hard way in what sense in sense that i well 
uh i was never in a unit that had general officers

31:44.830 --> 32:13.808
where i could work myself up except in the ninth 
division and that was disbanding then after that i

31:44.830 --> 32:13.808
was strange stranger to all these units like the 
75th maneuver command direct support group that

31:44.830 --> 32:13.808
was a brigadier general slot over in New Orleans. 
But

32:16.486 --> 32:25.100
going to the Army War College, I went to the Army War 
College. I want to go to those service schools.

32:29.206 --> 32:30.228
Let's talk about those. 1970, graduated in the 
first non-resident U.S. Army War College. What

32:36.377 --> 32:37.699
does it mean, non-resident? Non-resident is 
correspondent course. Oh, okay. For two years.

32:42.509 --> 32:44.131
It's a two-year course. Correspondent course. 
And in the summertime, we'd go to a two-week school

32:45.934 --> 32:54.646
at Carlisle Barracks at the War College. We did the 
first summer and we did the second summer. We

32:56.609 --> 32:58.772
graduated. We were the first non-resident course 
that they put on. Up to that time, as a reservist or

33:03.178 --> 33:10.468
National Guardsman, you had two slots open in the 
regular course. And if you wanted to go to the work

33:12.277 --> 33:18.325
college you had to apply for those two slots and if 
you out of a hundred people who applied you had no

33:12.277 --> 33:18.325
chance. So they tried this and sixty percent of us 
were reservists and forty percent were active

33:19.867 --> 33:30.020
army people, regular army people in this car spot, 
yeah. So this just wasn't for the reservists? No,

33:32.223 --> 33:33.585
it wasn't for the reservists. And it equaled to the 
If you got a degree in a non-resident course, it was

33:40.390 --> 33:48.098
the same as getting a degree, a diploma, in the 
regular resident course. So the merit was the same

33:48.118 --> 33:51.602
for promotion to general. And that was Paramount 
and their active army to be general, to go to the War

33:52.603 --> 34:00.171
College. They had to go to the War College. They had 
to go to the War College. And the reserve, they

34:02.153 --> 34:06.778
wanted to make it Paramount, too. That's why they 
set it up. But there's a lot of politics in the

34:08.774 --> 34:10.476
reserve. A lot of guys didn't go to the War College, 
got more general. But after we completed that two

34:13.899 --> 34:20.486
year course, they realized that we had a double 
dose of it. We took twice as much

34:21.908 --> 34:29.095
classes as the regular Army course did. So they cut 
it down. They cut down the lessons. My thesis was,

34:36.010 --> 34:38.293
we had to write a thesis. Really? Yeah, god dang. My 
thesis was on the storage of oil in the middle of the

34:41.417 --> 34:44.881
ocean. You know how you got these oil fields, these 
wells out there now? I'd contend and instead of

34:50.608 --> 35:05.427
trying to build pipelines all the way in, get 
rubber bags and fill them full of oil and then a ship

34:50.608 --> 35:05.427
would come up, press a button and a snorkel would 
come up and hook up and take the oil out and then

35:05.930 --> 35:09.114
carry it in. Or if the battleships, the Navy needed 
oil, they'd press a button, the snorkel would come

35:09.134 --> 35:14.441
up. I'll give it to you in a simple term, but I went 
out here to Bethlehem Steel, who builds these

35:15.162 --> 35:27.438
rigs, and I got all kinds of oil books and sat down 
and researched it and got a pretty good paper.

35:28.960 --> 35:30.942
Pretty neat. They said, Terry, that the course we 
took was

35:36.912 --> 35:38.514
master's degree level. Great. It was that way. You 
ask Catherine, on Saturday nights, instead of

35:40.957 --> 35:49.067
going out, I was at the dining room table doing my 
lessons for the War College. Oh, yeah. I spent many

35:50.169 --> 35:52.872
hours doing it, and it was tough. Tough. Now, 
you've got to remember, I was 1970. You hadn't been

35:56.677 --> 35:58.800
to school for a while. Oh, yeah. I was 50 years old. 
But I enjoyed it. It was good. It was challenging,

36:03.546 --> 36:06.109
you know. Catherine would come in and we'd discuss 
the communist parties in different countries,

36:06.562 --> 36:13.910
you know, and that's what most of it was about. And 
when we got to college, the War College, we

36:14.371 --> 36:20.338
actually drew up the budget for the Army, 
Department of the Army. The actual budget. How

36:22.480 --> 36:26.945
many tanks we needed, how many guns we needed, how 
many trucks we needed. Of course, we had a format to

36:27.446 --> 36:28.988
follow. And it was very good. But I was glad to see 
that they gave it. Hollingsworth, there's what

36:36.734 --> 36:41.239
they call a Hollingsworth Report. I keep bringing 
his name up because he was a very prominent

36:41.279 --> 36:45.003
officer. They had a Hollingsworth Report. He 
headed up a team, a blue chip team, back in 1965 that

36:47.907 --> 36:57.518
outlined the steps for a reserve officer to become 
general. And that was Command, Command General

36:59.420 --> 37:04.986
Staff College, and the Army War College. And I took 
every one of those steps. And I think that had a lot

37:09.419 --> 37:12.362
to do with it. How about the General Staff College? 
Command General Staff at Fort Laverne? Very fine

37:16.668 --> 37:17.829
school. Tell me about that. It dealt with tactics. 
You were there in 1961, yeah? Yeah, it dealt with

37:21.454 --> 37:22.335
tactics. I went there, and I was at the resident, of 
course. And I look back now, and I don't know how

37:25.799 --> 37:28.823
Catherine let me go. How long was it? From January 
to May. No kidding. Yeah. She came up a couple of

37:36.151 --> 37:38.173
times and stayed with me. But we had four kids, 
yeah, four kids. I'll tell you right here, I don't

37:44.360 --> 38:05.803
care what they say, a

37:44.360 --> 38:05.803
career reservist, and I was a career reservist, I 
could never accomplish being a general officer

37:44.360 --> 38:05.803
unless I had a dedicated wife who really 
sacrificed

38:06.728 --> 38:09.931
her time for me to be gone like I was. Yeah, five 
months? Oh, yeah. Not only that, but on weekends.

38:15.257 --> 38:20.923
And at nights, and I don't see, yeah, she's still 
with me.

38:24.287 --> 38:27.270
I couldn't have ever done it, and Catherine has 
been a big asset to me. Not only in that, but

38:29.753 --> 38:36.280
socials, we go to socials, you know, receptions 
and stuff, see-saw. She's an extrovert. Just

38:37.764 --> 38:39.286
people love her. And so I never could accomplish 
what I did without her. No question about it. Well,

38:46.115 --> 38:52.303
just the dedication of you going out and leaving 
your job, your profession, for five months to take

38:46.115 --> 38:52.303
this. What was going on back at the store? Yeah, 
well, of course, I called about every other day and

38:54.887 --> 39:00.875
checked and made decisions from there. And

39:00.915 --> 39:04.680
came home. one time during Easter and did a lot of 
work. But it was pretty well taken care of. But

39:15.159 --> 39:21.146
Command General Staff College taught you tactics 
on how to maneuver.

39:24.090 --> 39:29.597
It was just fine school, college.

39:30.458 --> 39:33.942
I won the school handball championship while I was 
there. That's a story. I went down there. First

39:37.954 --> 39:39.916
Sunday I got there, I went and took my gloves. And I 
was tired from traveling and everything. I went

39:42.639 --> 39:44.922
down to the handball courts to play. And two guys 
were playing. And I asked them to play cut-throat

39:46.223 --> 39:48.726
with me. They said, oh, no, we want to play singles. 
So I said, OK. I introduced myself then. One was

39:54.834 --> 39:55.955
named Adler. And I think the other guy was named 
Hanson. But Adler, then as I walked out the door,

39:59.459 --> 40:05.987
there was a sign-up scheduled for a tournament, a 
school tournament. So I signed up. Adler and I met

40:10.236 --> 40:13.819
in the finals, Major Adler. And I just beat the hell 
out of him. And he says, why did you beat me so bad?

40:21.327 --> 40:24.831
Because you wouldn't let me play cut throw with 
you, wouldn't I? Oh, you were the little fellow

40:24.851 --> 40:27.494
that come down and won the play. I said, that was me. 
From then on, we were good friends. But I just, oh,

40:31.258 --> 40:33.320
gosh. I really put it on him. I really had an 
incentive to win, because he wouldn't let me play

40:35.279 --> 40:39.004
with him. When you retired, what were your 
feelings? Are you ready to retire? Or just tell me

40:45.792 --> 40:47.754
how you felt when you retired. I felt like I could do 
more. I felt

40:50.337 --> 40:54.642
like I was at my peak. Why did you retire? I had to. So 
you serve five years as Brigadier General, and

40:57.786 --> 41:03.413
then you have to retire, unless you get promoted. 
And I was recommended by the 5th Army Commander for

41:04.439 --> 41:09.325
a two-star slot. But before the board could meet to 
select the officer to occupy, my retirement age

41:10.146 --> 41:19.497
came up. My retirement time, I was 57 years old, 58. 
And so that knocked me out. But I still today feel

41:28.749 --> 41:31.392
like I could I could get out in the field and 
maneuver with any of them. My mind's just as sharp,

41:36.076 --> 41:39.559
probably better the older. But I felt like I could 
still continue. Did you have any resentment then?

41:50.371 --> 41:53.074
No, I didn't feel resentful at all. I was 
disappointed that the board didn't meet quick

41:53.635 --> 42:00.282
enough to make a selection. They met about a month 
later and they made the selection. And it was a job

42:04.392 --> 42:10.859
in the Pentagon, mobilization assignment, 
two-star slot. And I had everybody supporting me.

42:13.602 --> 42:15.804
The active army, everybody was... So you would 
have to go out to the Pentagon once a month, pretty

42:15.824 --> 42:19.468
much? Well, not once a month, about three or four 
times a year. On the mobilization assignment, you

42:22.051 --> 42:26.716
meet about twice a year. And in one, two weeks... 
tour, you're not exactly. And I felt that that

42:33.287 --> 42:49.792
would have been just right for me, because with all 
the experience I had in the field and schooling, I

42:33.287 --> 42:49.792
believe I could have been of some good use to them in 
the plans and operation of the Department of the

42:33.287 --> 42:49.792
Army. That's where it was. Well, it would have been 
very interesting, since you never served in the

42:50.853 --> 42:53.858
Pentagon. That's right. I would have loved to have 
served in the Pentagon. But I didn't feel any

42:58.044 --> 42:59.867
resentment. When I left,

43:00.387 --> 43:07.378
they gave me all the courtesies on the 75th night. 
Gave me a beautiful retirement party, retirement

43:07.399 --> 43:10.924
ceremony. And everybody, you know, I felt like 
they really were sincere and I've done a good job

43:12.006 --> 43:18.737
for them. And they invited me back to come back and 
visit with them. And I've been back a couple of

43:23.585 --> 43:25.989
times, but I hadn't been back lately. Just hadn't 
had time. Well, when you think over advancement in

43:27.337 --> 43:43.691
the military and just your advancement during 
your career in the military, did you think that you

43:27.337 --> 43:43.691
were advanced because of your own personal 
behavior, or did you think it had something to do

43:27.337 --> 43:43.691
with the bureaucracy out there? For my 
advancement? My personal behavior. I don't think

43:47.715 --> 43:51.058
bureaucracy had a damn thing to do with it. I can't 
recall where I was in a position where he said,

43:51.078 --> 43:56.803
well, he's in that position, he ought to be 
promoted. No. No. As far as promotions are

44:02.095 --> 44:07.782
concerned, do you think that there's a difference 
between promotion in the military life and any

44:02.095 --> 44:07.782
other profession? I mean, do you think it's the 
same characteristics that get a promotion that

44:10.045 --> 44:17.975
receive that type of reward in the military versus 
in the business world? As an executive

44:19.096 --> 44:21.880
incorporation, I think they're the same. I think 
it's a self-discipline to do a job and do it right

44:22.265 --> 44:27.772
and do it good. And I think as a commander and as, 
say, president of an organization, I think it's

44:28.613 --> 44:48.778
the

44:28.613 --> 44:48.778
leadership that will make a person do the best that 
he can at the job that he's given to do. To do the best

44:54.403 --> 45:01.590
he can at the assignment they give him. I think 
that's leadership. I think it's an

45:05.434 --> 45:07.236
incorporation. I feel like I could run any 
multiple corporation type job. I wouldn't

45:15.865 --> 45:18.748
hesitate. going over and maybe you know like Exxon 
or Gulf or you know I feel like I could step right in

45:19.252 --> 45:49.258
there because I would I've learned to try to 
inspire a person to do the best he can to his ability

45:19.252 --> 45:49.258
see that's another aspect of leadership now that 
we're on leadership you define as doing the best

45:19.252 --> 45:49.258
job at the best time and also inspiring others to do 
their best. And that's a good leader. That's what

45:55.253 --> 45:57.555
you say is a good leader. I would say that's a good 
leader. That's the key? I think the key is to get a

46:00.118 --> 46:12.269
man, to get a person to do the best he can, to the best 
of his ability, to do the job that he's assigned to

46:00.118 --> 46:12.269
do.

46:12.289 --> 46:13.330
Do the best he can. Get the most out of it. And a job 
that that he's assigned to do for you. Okay, and

46:21.929 --> 46:25.233
you've also said tonight that a leader has to be 
flexible. Right. In general. And I was wondering,

46:28.197 --> 46:32.001
how about values? Are values important as far as 
leadership is concerned?

46:40.231 --> 46:45.978
Oh yeah, you've got to have values to live by and to 
guide by and to lead by. Such as? Honesty.

46:57.451 --> 47:00.522
Confidence.
