WEBVTT

00:01.938 --> 00:08.367
It is Wednesday, September 8, and we're sitting in Chuck Cargill's study.

00:09.368 --> 00:19.422
We're going to chat first about his student years, and we're testing the microphone, so Chuck, it's your turn to say something.

00:19.442 --> 00:20.804
Well, Haskell, I'm glad you came over.

00:20.824 --> 00:27.233
I've been looking forward to it, and I hope that we can get something that will be useful to someone someday.

00:30.718 --> 00:31.759
Chuck,

00:32.515 --> 00:41.889
Give a brief biographical summary of your growing up years and your experience, where, how, when, before you came to A&M.

00:42.630 --> 00:43.391
Okay.

00:43.811 --> 00:58.032
I was a typical small town, small country town boy, born September the 22nd, 1931, which, of course, as you will know and a lot of other folks will know, was not really the best economic times in our country.

00:58.332 --> 00:59.434
I was a Depression kid.

01:00.781 --> 01:13.221
My father was a wholesale oil distributor in a small country town named Eddie, Texas, E-D-D-Y, located about 20 miles south of Waco, 14 miles north of Temple,

01:14.281 --> 01:16.223
on what is now Interstate 35.

01:16.724 --> 01:18.626
In my days it was US 81.

01:18.646 --> 01:27.677
It was a thriving little country town and had two cotton gins and had a frozen food locker plant of all things.

01:27.757 --> 01:29.539
No one had their own freezers in those days.

01:30.460 --> 01:37.228
We still used chunks of ice in our refrigerators for cooling.

01:37.248 --> 01:39.310
No electric refrigerators in those days.

01:40.032 --> 01:46.601
And my vivid recollection, of course, one of my earliest recollections is of World War II.

01:47.682 --> 01:52.028
I guess our little country town had around 400 people in it.

01:53.170 --> 02:03.063
And during the Depression, my father, as I mentioned, was in the wholesale oil business, distributing business, distributing oil and petroleum products to farmers and ranchers in that area.

02:03.083 --> 02:03.884
Not too many ranchers.

02:03.924 --> 02:08.470
Most of them were cotton farmers or corn farmers or what we call

02:09.074 --> 02:10.195
high gear.

02:10.836 --> 02:14.761
Some people call it Higuera and some people call it red top maize.

02:14.801 --> 02:15.702
We call it high gear.

02:16.523 --> 02:17.464
And it was a feed crop.

02:18.425 --> 02:26.595
But to make a fairly long story short, he flat went broke during the depression in the oil business as many people did in small businesses.

02:27.677 --> 02:32.863
And as it worked out, he was somewhat of a political leader in our little town.

02:34.385 --> 02:38.710
And we had a postmaster in the early days, probably before I was born,

02:39.365 --> 02:40.847
named Carbon Lewis.

02:41.569 --> 02:45.755
Now, Carbon Lewis was the only Republican in Eddie, and he was the postmaster.

02:45.996 --> 02:50.123
Of course, that's back when the SPAIL system was in full swing.

02:52.006 --> 02:57.154
We used to see him, we lived almost across the street from Mr. Lewis, and we'd see him walk into town to go to work,

02:57.353 --> 02:59.355
And mother and dad said, there goes that Republican.

02:59.375 --> 03:01.217
Well, I thought it was a disease of some kind.

03:02.018 --> 03:06.722
And in those days in small towns, you know, it was, they were just one party, basically.

03:07.503 --> 03:19.635
But then my dad met and became friends with Jim Farley, who was the postmaster general at that time, and was appointed as postmaster of our little town, which in the Depression days.

03:19.655 --> 03:21.157
Where did they meet?

03:21.177 --> 03:26.702
There was a gentleman in Waco by the name of Carlton Smith, who was an attorney.

03:27.070 --> 03:31.998
And he was a bosom buddy of a congressman from that area named Bob Pogue.

03:33.280 --> 03:37.447
And Bob Pogue introduced Dad to Jim Farley.

03:38.249 --> 03:40.913
Jim Farley had a phenomenal memory for names.

03:41.254 --> 03:46.823
He could call people by the thousands by their name, and it just astonished everyone.

03:46.843 --> 03:49.808
No one ever knew how he did it, but it was just a gift that he had.

03:50.730 --> 03:53.314
But Dad was somewhat of a...

03:53.733 --> 04:18.795
kind of a political leader in our little town and and through that connection he was appointed as postmaster now this was about this was in probably 30 1932 33 time frame and was postmaster for many many years and shortly before he retired he didn't like working all day every day because he wanted to kind of phase into retirement well the rural male route

04:19.366 --> 04:23.431
was only about a half-a-day job and paid more money than a postmaster's job did.

04:23.511 --> 04:31.259
So he transferred to the rural mail route and delivered mail for, oh, four, five, six years before he actually retired.

04:32.321 --> 04:35.865
Mother, on the other hand, was, of course, a typical housewife in those days.

04:35.925 --> 04:37.987
Most mothers didn't work in those days.

04:38.848 --> 04:43.213
But during the war, she worked at Blue Bonnet Ordnance Plant in McGregor.

04:43.683 --> 04:46.609
making bombs for the war effort.

04:46.629 --> 04:59.835
And I remember she would come in and she would have some yellow powder on her shoes and on parts of her clothing which turned out to be probably TNT or something of that nature.

05:00.575 --> 05:06.844
But I grew up in that little country town and went to a little elementary school in Eddy.

05:06.864 --> 05:13.354
And then when you got into some of the higher grades, we had a consolidated school district called Bruceville Eddy.

05:13.534 --> 05:18.641
Bruceville was a little town not far from Eddy, about two miles, I think, and the school was in the middle.

05:19.543 --> 05:20.945
And so I went to Bruceville Eddy.

05:21.986 --> 05:26.633
And my uncle was class of 38 at Texas A&M.

05:27.372 --> 05:53.548
crippled gentleman by the name of Tom Cole he had polio when he was a child and but at that time you could get in almost like we would call a drill and ceremony student today but he was in the core even though he was badly crippled from polio well he was the predominant influence to for me to go to A&M through the rest of the family you know there was just never any discussion number one I was going to college mother was a school teacher

05:53.917 --> 05:58.287
had two years at Mary Hardin Baylor, which gave you a teaching certificate in those days.

05:58.307 --> 06:00.451
You didn't have to graduate from college.

06:01.153 --> 06:09.411
So through Uncle Tommy's influence and the influence of the rest of the family, number one, there was no question I was going to college, no matter what it took.

06:09.982 --> 06:13.147
And number two, I was going to A&M, period.

06:13.929 --> 06:17.875
I'm sure that there probably would have been some other alternatives, but they were never considered.

06:18.957 --> 06:28.092
And so about my sophomore year in high school, we started checking into what does it take to get into A&M, scholastically.

06:28.240 --> 06:30.983
And I was the valedictorian of my eighth grade class.

06:31.003 --> 06:34.426
You know, back in those days, when you graduate from grammar school, that was a big deal.

06:35.387 --> 06:37.449
And so... How many in that class?

06:37.469 --> 06:39.130
We had 25 at that time.

06:39.391 --> 06:41.613
The time we graduated, I think, was down to about 18.

06:42.293 --> 06:43.995
But... Excuse me.

06:45.637 --> 06:57.488
We found that the only science course that was being offered at Bruceville Eddy at that time was vocational agriculture, which didn't quite hack it as far as entrance requirements for A&M were concerned.

06:58.210 --> 07:10.233
Mother and dad got with whoever the school people were, and I transferred into Waco High School for my junior and senior year, and was able to take chemistry in, oh, I don't know what else.

07:10.253 --> 07:11.616
And that was how far away?

07:11.636 --> 07:12.598
That was 20 miles.

07:13.119 --> 07:15.704
And I rode the Greyhound bus back and forth each way.

07:15.744 --> 07:20.353
The bus station was right across the street from our house, so I'd catch the bus, drive in to

07:20.840 --> 07:28.471
to Waco and sit in the bus station until it was time to go to school, which was just three blocks over, Waco High School, just three blocks over from the bus station.

07:29.453 --> 07:35.482
And then I would go back to the bus station and sit in the bus station until it was time to go home.

07:36.263 --> 07:38.226
And what was that cost?

07:38.246 --> 07:41.110
I think it was 25 cents, maybe 50 cents or something.

07:42.152 --> 07:44.535
And I've forgotten if we could buy a pass or not.

07:45.140 --> 07:48.105
But I learned one of my most valuable skills sitting in the bus station.

07:49.126 --> 07:52.672
Back in those days, they gave bus calls.

07:53.653 --> 07:56.257
And you'd listen to the calls so you'd know which bus to go in.

07:56.638 --> 07:59.382
So I learned the bus calls.

07:59.402 --> 08:04.690
And since I was going south, it was important for me to know the southbound bus calls.

08:04.710 --> 08:13.223
So I learned that when the announcer would come on, he would say, Southbound Greyhound, now leaving for San Antonio by way of...

08:13.203 --> 08:21.777
Lorena, Bruceville, Eddie, Troy, Temple, Belton, Salado, Gerald, Georgetown, Round Rock, Austin, Kyle, San Marcos, New Braunfels, and San Antonio.

08:22.338 --> 08:27.888
So that's one of my most valuable skills is to be able to know the towns in order from Waco to San Antonio.

08:28.989 --> 08:30.552
But I have a lot of fun with that.

08:31.313 --> 08:35.380
But then of course I graduated from A&M and

08:35.579 --> 08:37.102
You said A&M.

08:37.122 --> 08:37.642
I'm sorry.

08:37.662 --> 08:44.434
I graduated from Waco High School in 1949 and came to A&M.

08:44.634 --> 08:45.816
All right, let's see.

08:45.836 --> 08:50.123
Had you visited A&M before coming to be a student?

08:50.143 --> 08:56.293
Never set foot on the campus until Mom and Dad drove me down to register.

08:56.454 --> 08:57.736
All right, they drove you down.

08:58.036 --> 09:00.861
What did you bring physically with you?

09:01.448 --> 09:29.869
that first time as i recall we came down to register and then we went back home to pick up my belongings to report out to brian air force base when we when we finally came down of course texas avenue we didn't have texas avenue at the time we drove down south college and i remember my first first side of a m was the the north view of the systems administration building that you see driving down south college so we registered went back home and

09:29.849 --> 09:31.951
I brought an Army Foot Locker.

09:33.172 --> 09:39.639
It was forest green, you know, the old Army Foot Lockers, the color they were.

09:42.141 --> 09:42.682
Let's see.

09:43.583 --> 09:49.569
Our uniforms were issued to us at that time, so I didn't have to worry about uniforms, and we habitually wore the uniform, day and night.

09:50.269 --> 09:54.273
Of course, I brought my socks and underwear and stuff like that.

09:55.455 --> 09:58.358
I really don't remember bringing any civilian clothes because we couldn't wear them.

09:58.618 --> 09:59.839
Did you even bring a radio?

10:00.511 --> 10:02.434
I don't think I had a radio at that time.

10:02.454 --> 10:03.415
You didn't have a typewriter.

10:03.636 --> 10:03.856
No.

10:04.818 --> 10:11.768
So you brought almost no personal property other than a little bit of clothing.

10:12.569 --> 10:15.474
What kind of razor did you use?

10:15.614 --> 10:16.916
It was an old safety razor.

10:17.517 --> 10:20.742
And that was before even they came out with the Gillette blue blade.

10:21.002 --> 10:22.765
They had the red packages.

10:23.045 --> 10:26.991
And boy, it was a brutal weapon of torture.

10:27.157 --> 10:30.021
and I'd cut myself every time I'd shave, but it was a safety razor.

10:31.563 --> 10:42.817
Back when I first started shaving, my daddy always used a straight razor, and he had a razor strap, and he would hone that razor on the razor strap and use the wet rock and all that kind of stuff.

10:42.837 --> 10:48.585
And I tried that a couple times and almost cut my throat two or three times, so we finally decided that I probably needed a safety razor.

10:49.446 --> 10:54.953
Mom and Dad then bring you down with the footlocker, and where do they deposit you?

10:56.435 --> 11:01.704
We didn't know anything about Bryan Air Force Base at that time, which we commonly referred to as the Annex.

11:01.724 --> 11:14.646
So we went to Bryan Air Force Base, and I'd already been assigned to Barrack 321, which was an Air Force unit, which was the first hint that I had that I was going to be in an Air Force unit.

11:15.368 --> 11:17.737
Oh, one other thing before we leave my registration.

11:18.159 --> 11:20.629
I had no idea what I wanted to major in when I came here.

11:20.870 --> 11:24.062
At that time, we didn't have an undeclared major.

11:24.183 --> 11:26.492
On the day you walked in, you told them what you wanted to do.

11:27.265 --> 11:33.952
So we were standing in line and a friend of mine that grew up in Eddy but had since moved to McGregor was in line in front of me.

11:33.992 --> 11:36.415
He was my bunkmate, Skipper MacMellon.

11:37.456 --> 11:42.602
And we were standing in line and they said, Skipper, what do you want to major in?

11:42.942 --> 11:44.825
He said, I want to take petroleum engineering.

11:46.146 --> 11:48.529
And they came to me and he said, what do you want to major in?

11:48.549 --> 11:50.010
And I said, Skipper, what did you decide?

11:50.311 --> 11:51.472
He said, petroleum engineering.

11:51.492 --> 11:52.573
I said, that sounds good to me.

11:52.613 --> 11:53.214
Sign me up.

11:54.035 --> 11:56.918
Well, I was not an engineer from day one.

11:56.898 --> 12:21.150
flunked everything that you can imagine possibly because of some of my insufficient background but possibly because it was just something i would not adapt to and so anyway that's how i picked my major was because the guy in line in front of me had that major so that seemed reason enough for me excuse me just for a second y'all did that registration

12:21.890 --> 12:25.014
Out at Bryan Field or on the campus?

12:25.034 --> 12:26.295
On the campus, as I recall.

12:26.475 --> 12:28.358
And it was in Cebesa Hall, as I recall.

12:29.639 --> 12:30.420
Yep.

12:30.580 --> 12:37.048
And so then when Mom and Dad brought me down, we pulled up to barracks 321.

12:37.488 --> 12:39.350
Of course, everyone out there was a freshman.

12:40.952 --> 12:45.838
I knew that there was such a thing as hazing, but it was the furthest thing from my mind at that point.

12:46.291 --> 12:49.818
And there were 20 men in an open bay barracks, double bunks.

12:50.819 --> 12:52.122
The skipper was on the top bunk.

12:52.222 --> 12:53.645
I was on the bottom bunk.

12:53.665 --> 12:55.588
And we were the first bunk because we went in the door.

12:56.189 --> 13:00.077
As you go in the door of the barracks, well, then the bunks were crossways and then 10 bunks.

13:00.578 --> 13:03.523
And then you had five bunks, and then in the middle was a big heater.

13:04.550 --> 13:13.001
and then five more bunks, and then out the back door, you went outside to the showers and the latrine and your sinks and all that kind of stuff.

13:14.143 --> 13:21.493
And the shower room and so forth, I would say would probably be 50, 60, 70 feet from the back door.

13:21.693 --> 13:23.215
So if it's raining, you just got wet.

13:23.976 --> 13:26.760
And of course, all of us had uniforms, ponchos,

13:27.162 --> 13:30.207
Helmet liners, which we had other names for the helmet liners, as you know.

13:31.069 --> 13:35.537
Shower clogs because that's what you wore to go to and from so you wouldn't get your feet dirty.

13:36.578 --> 13:43.230
And so mother and daddy, when they pulled up and saw the barracks and dad helped me carry the footlocker in,

13:43.919 --> 13:48.705
They came within an inch of loading me up and taking me back home because they had no idea.

13:48.725 --> 13:51.808
You know, it was like being a basic trainee in the Army at that time.

13:52.689 --> 13:55.573
But we said, no, we'll go ahead and go with it.

13:55.593 --> 13:57.435
Now, this is September of 1940?

13:57.455 --> 14:00.879
1949, September.

14:00.999 --> 14:06.485
I graduated in May of 49 from Waco High School and started here in September of 49.

14:07.427 --> 14:12.272
And it's late September, but still in those years, but it's still hot.

14:12.653 --> 14:13.774
Oh, yes.

14:14.007 --> 14:17.533
of heating and cooling did you have in that building?

14:17.553 --> 14:19.225
We had we had this giant

14:19.711 --> 14:22.696
almost like a pot-bellied stove right in the middle.

14:22.716 --> 14:27.645
The guys in the middle were always complaining about being too hot, and the guys on the end were always complaining about being too cold.

14:28.125 --> 14:30.530
We had no cooling whatsoever.

14:30.630 --> 14:31.772
No fan even?

14:31.832 --> 14:32.633
Not even a fan.

14:33.254 --> 14:43.832
We had opened both double doors in the front, both double doors in the back, and then they had side windows almost over each bunk on each side that you could prop up with some kind of a prop.

14:43.872 --> 14:45.415
So we kept those open all the time.

14:45.918 --> 14:49.385
But we didn't particularly, I don't remember it being unbearable at all.

14:49.545 --> 14:52.291
Now, what was your outfit named and nicknamed?

14:52.311 --> 14:58.764
It was, my freshman outfit was, oh, my goodness.

15:00.027 --> 15:00.788
It was in Barrack 321.

15:01.129 --> 15:01.370
Squadron.

15:02.432 --> 15:03.334
It was Flight 9.

15:03.534 --> 15:04.155
Flight 9.

15:04.336 --> 15:05.057
Flight 9.

15:05.358 --> 15:08.604
Did it have a nickname that's tellable in mixed company?

15:09.044 --> 15:09.986
Not my freshman year.

15:10.046 --> 15:16.858
Now, later on, when I got on the campus, my sophomore year, then we had, I remember those pretty well, and we had nicknames there.

15:17.278 --> 15:21.005
And do you remember what courses you had during that year?

15:21.586 --> 15:29.880
ME, trig, mechanical engineering, trig, algebra, chemistry, English.

15:30.130 --> 15:31.051
Nineteen hours.

15:31.993 --> 15:32.554
First semester.

15:32.814 --> 15:33.475
First semester.

15:34.176 --> 15:35.779
And PE course.

15:36.941 --> 15:42.209
What was a, describe a typical Monday through Friday.

15:42.229 --> 15:43.631
I know there were Saturday morning classes.

15:44.051 --> 15:45.934
But describe a typical day.

15:46.335 --> 15:49.740
What time did you get up and what happened all the way through to bedtime?

15:49.760 --> 15:51.383
We did everything by bugle calls.

15:52.344 --> 15:56.070
And even if you had a clock, which most of us didn't,

15:56.455 --> 15:57.799
You didn't pay any attention to the clock.

15:57.819 --> 15:58.941
You listened to the bugle calls.

15:59.643 --> 16:03.173
And we would have reveille, as I recall, around 6 o'clock.

16:04.255 --> 16:06.822
And we'd fall out in front of our barracks, rain or shine.

16:07.885 --> 16:11.815
Bob Melcher was the commandant of the annex at that time.

16:12.132 --> 16:13.493
And he was tough.

16:13.814 --> 16:19.040
Later became a very close personal friend of mine, but at that time he was God as far as everyone was concerned.

16:20.021 --> 16:29.912
And we had several tactical officers which assisted Bob, Colonel Melcher, in disciplining and making sure everybody did what they were supposed to do.

16:30.452 --> 16:31.313
But we would fall out.

16:31.353 --> 16:32.354
We would hear the bugle call.

16:32.414 --> 16:33.095
We'd fall out.

16:33.916 --> 16:42.105
And then we would, in formation in front of our barracks, would have the flag raising.

16:42.558 --> 16:46.126
And then we would march to the chow hall and eat breakfast.

16:46.948 --> 16:51.297
And you had so many minutes to eat breakfast, then you'd fall back in and, no, wait, you didn't.

16:51.317 --> 16:58.693
We marched to the chow hall, but then we left on our own because some could take more time if they didn't have an early class or what have you.

16:59.618 --> 17:11.957
And all of the buildings, including the classroom buildings, were World War II-type construction, just wooden with tar paper on the outside a lot of times, and just not permanent construction at all.

17:12.578 --> 17:14.301
But they were pretty sound buildings.

17:14.321 --> 17:15.583
Classes began then at 8?

17:16.023 --> 17:16.965
As I recall, yes.

17:18.948 --> 17:20.310
Do you remember class sizes?

17:21.505 --> 17:23.527
I'd say around 20, a little over maybe.

17:23.627 --> 17:25.249
So class sections were reasonably small?

17:25.269 --> 17:29.394
Reasonably small, and all the profs came out from the main campus to teach us.

17:29.714 --> 17:35.040
No one lived on the campus except, well, Bob Melcher was a commandant.

17:35.220 --> 17:37.103
He was in charge of discipline and what have you.

17:37.703 --> 17:43.750
And John Paul Abbott was our dean, and he was in charge of the academic end of the thing.

17:44.033 --> 17:45.416
But he was the dean of the whole county.

17:45.436 --> 17:47.160
He was the dean of the annex.

17:47.180 --> 17:47.701
Oh, of the annex.

17:47.721 --> 17:48.724
Of the annex, yes.

17:48.904 --> 17:49.806
Just of the annex.

17:50.287 --> 17:51.290
But he didn't live out there.

17:51.310 --> 17:53.254
He didn't live there, but he was there all day, every day.

17:54.357 --> 18:00.591
And I remember that on our freshman orientation, they got us all in the theater building, the old theater.

18:02.225 --> 18:05.488
And Dean Ransdell gave us a little pep talk.

18:05.689 --> 18:08.992
And every other word, he was going to give us the poop.

18:09.012 --> 18:12.436
And, of course, his obvious nickname was Poop Ransdell.

18:12.456 --> 18:12.576
Oh.

18:13.016 --> 18:16.460
That's how his nickname, because he, I'm going to give you the poop, the straight poop.

18:16.480 --> 18:19.963
These other guys can tell you things, but you listen to me because I'm going to give you the straight poop.

18:20.804 --> 18:24.108
And so from that time on, he was Poop Ransdell as far as we were concerned.

18:25.229 --> 18:26.490
All right.

18:26.510 --> 18:29.413
You're in class almost every hour?

18:30.203 --> 18:30.844
Pretty well.

18:31.025 --> 18:31.886
We had some breaks.

18:32.087 --> 18:33.890
Of course, we had an hour off for lunch.

18:34.070 --> 18:35.834
Did you fall in in March to lunch?

18:35.994 --> 18:36.936
No, not to lunch.

18:38.198 --> 18:39.981
For breakfast and for the evening meal.

18:40.162 --> 18:46.153
We had formation in March to lunch, and then after the evening meal,

18:46.133 --> 18:55.071
We'd trickle out as we finished our meal and we'd have a couple of hours free time before CQ, call to quarters.

18:55.091 --> 18:58.899
And we had to be in our room with no talking or anything else.

18:59.280 --> 19:01.184
From 7 to 10 was CQ.

19:01.625 --> 19:05.172
Where did you, what kind of facility did you have for study?

19:05.405 --> 19:11.015
We had a desk probably half the size of this one for each student.

19:11.035 --> 19:13.880
Where was it in relation to your bunk?

19:14.280 --> 19:17.205
Let's say the bunk was here and the side wall was here.

19:17.806 --> 19:24.738
Both desks would be pushed up against this wall facing each other, almost like a partner's desk, but they were individual desks.

19:24.758 --> 19:29.286
Then on the other side was our hanging rack for our clothes and our foot lockers underneath that.

19:30.076 --> 19:30.737
And that was it.

19:31.558 --> 19:33.561
We'd line our shoes up under the bed.

19:33.661 --> 19:36.706
Of course, they had to always be shined and what have you.

19:36.726 --> 19:40.652
Okay, that first fall, well, it was your only fall out there.

19:41.853 --> 19:44.778
How long was it before you and your buddies went anywhere?

19:45.479 --> 19:46.781
The first home football game.

19:48.383 --> 19:49.625
Lee will get that.

19:50.806 --> 19:53.290
And it might ring one more time before she picks it.

19:53.310 --> 19:54.632
No, she got it the first ring.

19:54.899 --> 20:04.087
The first home football game was the first time we were off the campus, and that was our first introduction to upperclassmen, and it was horrible.

20:04.928 --> 20:13.456
Those sophomores had been just waiting for a chance because they had been through it the year before, and they had not even seen a freshman up to that first home football game.

20:14.317 --> 20:22.324
And we, of course, had been taught how to whip out and meet people and introduce ourselves and the proper way to address upperclassmen and what have you.

20:23.047 --> 20:25.751
But we'd never really been hazed up until that point.

20:25.991 --> 20:27.754
And no physical hazing there.

20:28.215 --> 20:29.437
It was strictly mental.

20:29.457 --> 20:33.042
But boy, it was, you know, I'd always led a sheltered life.

20:33.062 --> 20:34.084
Everybody had been nice to me.

20:34.144 --> 20:35.926
I'd been raised in the First Baptist Church.

20:35.946 --> 20:41.335
And, you know, everybody was just like country folks are, just real friendly, outgoing.

20:41.355 --> 20:43.618
And no one had ever raised their voice to me in my life.

20:44.179 --> 20:45.561
So it was a rude awakening.

20:45.811 --> 20:46.952
Can you give some samples?

20:47.513 --> 20:53.580
Oh, for example, when you'd whip out, you'd stick out your hand, you'd say, Fist Jones is my name, sir.

20:54.801 --> 21:05.373
And he'd say, if the sophomores would say, Smith is my name, juniors would say, my name is Smith.

21:06.194 --> 21:07.836
Seniors would just say, Smith.

21:08.817 --> 21:10.980
And a sophomore could not say, my name is.

21:11.100 --> 21:14.704
He had to give his name first, you know, just a little something like that.

21:15.275 --> 21:21.763
And then you'd say, well, a lot of times they'd say, where are you from and what course are you taking?

21:22.644 --> 21:26.389
Well, you'd get in the habit of saying, I'm from Eddie taking Petroleum Engineering.

21:27.210 --> 21:28.151
And he'd say, where are you from?

21:28.171 --> 21:31.015
And I'd say, I'm from Eddie taking Petroleum Engineering.

21:31.315 --> 21:33.177
I didn't ask you what course you were taking.

21:33.778 --> 21:35.300
I'd just ask you where you were from, you know.

21:35.681 --> 21:38.204
And, of course, it would be much more severe than that.

21:40.487 --> 21:42.049
But, you know, those kinds of things.

21:42.109 --> 21:44.792
It would just get right up in your face and...

21:44.958 --> 21:46.541
But it was primarily verbal.

21:47.122 --> 21:48.865
At that point, my freshman year.

21:49.687 --> 21:51.691
Now my sophomore year was still a different story.

21:53.154 --> 22:00.688
So you come to the football game, did somebody come out there and explain to you all about

22:00.905 --> 22:26.473
standing up and practice, did you all have a little... We had freshman orientation and they went through all that and you know we were looking forward to seeing the game obviously we didn't see a play, not a play did we see and of course obviously stood up all the time just the way we still do and that wasn't a problem but as I recall they bused us in because nobody had a car in those days not even a bicycle and so

22:26.555 --> 22:30.539
Did you then go back out to the base soon after the game was over?

22:30.820 --> 22:31.180
Yes.

22:31.681 --> 22:37.046
And that was one of our most interesting nights, the night of our first home football game.

22:37.707 --> 22:39.709
All of us had been traumatized by the hazing.

22:40.871 --> 22:49.900
And so about 11 o'clock that night in the barracks next to us, all hell broke loose, screaming and hollering and hooping and glass breaking and furniture breaking.

22:49.920 --> 22:55.026
And we thought, man, the upperclassmen are over there tearing those kids up and they're going to be over here next.

22:55.563 --> 22:57.226
And we were scared to death.

22:57.987 --> 23:00.791
Next morning, we found out that there was not an upperclassman in sight.

23:00.851 --> 23:06.320
A bunch of those freshmen had gotten drunk and were raising cane themselves.

23:07.001 --> 23:09.645
So we thought, you know, it can't get any worse than that.

23:09.785 --> 23:10.707
Where'd they get the alcohol?

23:11.267 --> 23:13.210
Have no idea, but they got it somewhere.

23:13.932 --> 23:17.938
All right, now, across the river in Burleson County was wet, wasn't it?

23:17.958 --> 23:18.899
River Bridge, yes.

23:19.260 --> 23:20.642
Jones Road Bridge.

23:21.027 --> 23:24.291
And, but of course, I don't know.

23:24.311 --> 23:25.552
At that point.

23:25.572 --> 23:34.023
At that point, we, no one had a car to get over there, so someone had to bring it to them, or they had some Confederates, maybe some hometown buddies.

23:34.323 --> 23:35.805
That was another phenomenon, too.

23:37.767 --> 23:50.342
If you had a hometown buddy, and I claim Waco is my hometown because I was the only guy from Eddie, so I didn't have any hometown Eddie buddies, so I could legitimately tell everybody I was from Waco since I graduated from Waco High School.

23:50.626 --> 23:53.351
Well, you could drop handles with hometown buddies.

23:53.471 --> 23:59.863
That means you didn't have to observe the protocol and the etiquette of the class distinction there.

24:00.444 --> 24:04.551
So I had a lot of buddies from Waco that kind of tucked me under their wing and helped me along a little bit.

24:05.290 --> 24:07.573
And one of them was Guy King.

24:07.613 --> 24:12.259
He was a football player here, as I recall, and big football player for Waco High School when he was there.

24:13.200 --> 24:16.604
And I've forgotten the names, but there were several.

24:17.205 --> 24:21.771
And so that was a little benefit that I was able to enjoy.

24:22.111 --> 24:23.553
Do you remember the first Sunday?

24:23.854 --> 24:25.456
Did y'all have a chapel out there?

24:25.656 --> 24:28.800
We had chapel, and all of us went.

24:29.202 --> 24:34.067
As I recall, they had a Protestant service and a Catholic service, all in the same building but at different times.

24:34.327 --> 24:36.089
Do you remember who conducted them?

24:36.890 --> 24:37.611
No, I really don't.

24:37.951 --> 24:39.673
I was wondering, was it a local minister?

24:39.773 --> 24:48.262
No, I think it was someone that worked with the students as almost a counselor, but he was also a minister.

24:49.143 --> 24:51.325
And it was kind of a non-denominational type deal.

24:51.345 --> 24:53.007
We didn't have denominational services.

24:53.027 --> 24:54.469
They were non-denominational.

24:55.250 --> 24:57.572
But I don't remember who it was.

24:57.890 --> 25:05.297
All right, how long was it before you all began to talk, somebody began to talk about leaving?

25:06.559 --> 25:08.621
Oh, almost after the first football game.

25:08.841 --> 25:15.447
I mean, there were, as I mentioned, there were 20 of us that were in the barracks.

25:15.668 --> 25:23.155
And as I recall, we lost probably a third of them the first year, at least the third the first year.

25:23.540 --> 25:26.004
I think one or two of them left after the first football game.

25:26.024 --> 25:27.005
They're not going to put up with that.

25:27.686 --> 25:33.035
I don't remember who they were, but I remember a lot of the names of the guys that were in the barracks.

25:34.657 --> 25:44.152
Now, and as a group, these youngsters were basically, well, describe them basically.

25:44.172 --> 25:45.794
Background and ethnicity?

25:45.874 --> 25:47.898
We had, it was a Duke's mixture.

25:48.038 --> 25:50.762
There were a lot of guys from Houston.

25:51.400 --> 26:00.876
I remember there was one guy named Mack Neely and another guy from Chapman that were both from Houston and they were big buddies and kind of hell raising types but real likable guys.

26:02.199 --> 26:06.827
There were a lot of farm community boys like myself.

26:07.488 --> 26:13.358
I remember we had one guy Octavio Flores who was the son of the governor of

26:14.435 --> 26:16.539
I believe, in Mexico.

26:17.741 --> 26:19.504
He died not too long ago.

26:19.524 --> 26:21.608
I saw him in the Texas Aggie, but he went on to graduate.

26:22.410 --> 26:25.635
He was the only international student that I can remember.

26:27.018 --> 26:32.368
A lot of them from the Port Arthur, Beaumont, Golden Triangle area.

26:33.269 --> 26:34.151
Just all over.

26:35.634 --> 26:36.375
Rich and poor?

26:36.490 --> 26:37.091
Definitely.

26:39.193 --> 26:47.722
Most of us in our barracks were either from poor families or certainly no more than moderately well-off families.

26:48.002 --> 26:49.844
And they're all right out of high school.

26:49.864 --> 26:50.725
Right out of high school.

26:50.745 --> 26:52.106
No older than average.

26:52.306 --> 26:52.486
No.

26:52.647 --> 27:02.717
Now, they had a separate living area for those that were returning from the military, the veterans and what have you.

27:03.524 --> 27:06.628
Fish, who were World War II veterans, are out there also?

27:06.648 --> 27:09.572
They were, but they didn't have to go through all the guff that the rest of us did.

27:09.592 --> 27:15.460
There was no hazing and they were kind of, you know, the upperclassmen left them alone, so to speak.

27:15.480 --> 27:17.102
They figured they'd been through enough already.

27:17.983 --> 27:23.351
Now, what organizations were there out there, non-academic?

27:23.371 --> 27:24.112
I don't remember any.

27:24.132 --> 27:25.333
Those don't have a fish band?

27:25.794 --> 27:26.575
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.

27:26.595 --> 27:27.216
We surely did.

27:27.236 --> 27:28.077
Had a fish band.

27:28.097 --> 27:29.599
We had our own fish yell leaders.

27:30.271 --> 27:32.293
Paco Coronado was one of our yell leaders.

27:33.354 --> 27:39.301
Dukie Childs, who just, every time we have a class reunion, we always, Dukie leads us in some old yells.

27:40.843 --> 27:41.423
Fish drill team.

27:41.804 --> 27:42.685
Fish drill team.

27:44.687 --> 27:46.248
And let's see.

27:47.530 --> 27:51.174
Of course, we were big on intramural sports because that's all we had to do.

27:51.214 --> 27:53.096
There was no television, no movies.

27:53.116 --> 27:53.837
Well, I'll take it back.

27:53.877 --> 27:59.603
We did have a movie theater, and I think we could go to the movies on Wednesday night or something, maybe on Saturday night.

28:00.123 --> 28:04.549
These intramurals, what sports during the whole nine months, what sports were important?

28:04.569 --> 28:05.410
Touch football.

28:05.570 --> 28:08.213
We had some, did we have tennis courts?

28:08.854 --> 28:10.677
I don't remember if we had tennis courts or not.

28:12.339 --> 28:13.640
We played softball.

28:14.822 --> 28:19.248
Baseball and football were the two main ones that I recall.

28:19.348 --> 28:20.049
Not basketball?

28:20.629 --> 28:23.794
Yeah, we did play, had a gym, played some basketball.

28:24.174 --> 28:27.278
One of the favorite sports was to wait until after a big rain.

28:28.270 --> 28:30.654
And then we'd play football in the mud.

28:31.855 --> 28:34.099
And, of course, we'd get muddy from head to foot.

28:34.119 --> 28:35.321
That was the idea of the thing.

28:36.883 --> 28:38.886
And there were no social events out there?

28:39.507 --> 28:40.348
Not that I recall.

28:40.829 --> 28:45.576
Nobody, never had a date to go to the movie or anything like that?

28:45.596 --> 28:45.656
No.

28:45.676 --> 28:50.143
And you all got off that campus, the annexed campus, about how often?

28:51.895 --> 28:58.302
I'd say after the football season started, you had to get a pass just the way you do in the military.

28:58.883 --> 29:01.826
I think they gave us one weekend a month or something of that nature.

29:02.026 --> 29:04.248
My mind's hazy on how often we were able to get off.

29:04.269 --> 29:09.174
We'd go home, of course, on the holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas, and I guess we had spring break.

29:09.194 --> 29:10.475
I don't remember if we did or not.

29:10.836 --> 29:14.800
Do you remember during that year going into Bryan on a Saturday night?

29:14.820 --> 29:15.120
Yes.

29:15.341 --> 29:21.227
Yes, we could go in to see movies, go to Bryan and the old Schumann Theaters downtown.

29:21.967 --> 29:27.816
What were the apparent glamorous places for Aggie Fish to go?

29:27.836 --> 29:35.427
Well, they had a drug store on the corner of Maine, and I guess it was 26th Street, maybe, across from where the palace is.

29:36.309 --> 29:37.390
And I've forgotten the name.

29:37.450 --> 29:40.816
I want to say Kennedy's Pharmacy, but that may be at Northgate.

29:40.836 --> 29:42.959
I'm not sure which.

29:42.979 --> 29:46.284
But the drug store was a good place to get a hamburger and a milkshake.

29:47.065 --> 29:48.788
But this really was not a whole lot to do.

29:48.868 --> 29:49.729
I'll never forget.

29:50.249 --> 30:00.683
The first time we went to town, you know, the freshmen wore the winter uniforms were the olive green pants and the World War II blouse.

30:01.844 --> 30:10.495
The sophomores wore the same thing but with different emphasis on brass and the different braid on their cap so that you could tell them they were sophomores instead of freshmen.

30:11.216 --> 30:16.744
But the juniors were the first class that were able to wear pinks with their blouses.

30:16.764 --> 30:20.188
Well, we saw all these juniors coming that we thought were juniors.

30:20.590 --> 30:22.753
Well, it works out they were from Allen Academy.

30:23.334 --> 30:27.580
Allen Academy's uniform, all those kids wore pinks in the top.

30:27.600 --> 30:32.587
And from a distance, you couldn't tell them apart, especially if they were pretty big kids, from a junior at A&M.

30:33.147 --> 30:40.057
So I remember we'd go a half a block to avoid seeing those guys because we knew we were going to get hazed if they got close to us.

30:40.658 --> 30:44.844
And as it worked out, they were Allen Academy kids, or Allen rats as we called them in those days.

30:45.264 --> 30:47.307
What kinds of activities

30:48.113 --> 31:00.167
activities or events do you remember that any youngsters from the annex got involved in that might have been marginal or easily defined as prohibited?

31:02.350 --> 31:09.318
I guess that first night of the guys getting drunk was the only time I ever saw any evidence of alcohol, the whole nine months.

31:09.698 --> 31:09.838
Really?

31:09.858 --> 31:10.779
The whole nine months.

31:11.100 --> 31:14.003
What about alcohol in Bryan somewhere?

31:14.658 --> 31:19.521
No, I don't remember ever seeing anyone have an even
