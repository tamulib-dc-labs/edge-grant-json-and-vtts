00:03.929 --> 00:21.515
Can you recall any goofy incidents that you encountered because of a class being in an unusual location where you went to the wrong place or students got mixed up?

00:21.716 --> 00:22.958
Oh, that happened frequently.

00:23.939 --> 00:25.962
It wasn't unusual to have that happen on the first day.

00:26.643 --> 00:31.911
No one expected to have history classes in the meat labs building or in geology, for instance.

00:32.245 --> 00:35.872
One of our favorite rooms in those days was geology in Bolton Hall.

00:35.912 --> 00:37.255
They were both terrible rooms.

00:37.275 --> 00:42.364
Now you could argue Bolton Hall was okay because Bolton just across from Nagel is right next to academic.

00:42.384 --> 00:49.678
But that old lecture hall in Bolton was a horrible place and we used to kid about the one in geology that had bats flying around up at the top of it up there.

00:50.419 --> 00:54.928
And students got lost in that sense and didn't know where they were.

00:55.955 --> 00:59.603
Did you have a favorite and an unfavorite place to teach?

01:00.606 --> 01:01.327
Oh gosh, yes.

01:01.969 --> 01:05.577
I hated, well, it would have been a draw.

01:06.580 --> 01:10.729
There were some classrooms in, oh, I'm terrible, Francis Hall.

01:11.571 --> 01:14.959
Francis Hall had some rooms that were long and skinny.

01:15.918 --> 01:21.085
And I mean they were long, seven or eight seats wide, but 10 and 15 seats deep.

01:21.125 --> 01:22.087
You could teach seven, eight.

01:22.487 --> 01:27.575
And so you had this little long room here standing in front of the room, and you have students in the way in the back.

01:27.635 --> 01:31.580
Those were the worst rooms I really thought for teaching because it was hard.

01:31.781 --> 01:32.822
There was no sound system.

01:33.062 --> 01:38.730
It was hard to get your words from the front of that room, long and narrow, to the very back of that room.

01:39.171 --> 01:43.217
Some of the best classrooms for teaching were in physics because there was amphitheaters there.

01:43.257 --> 01:43.758
You were down.

01:44.278 --> 01:45.520
The students were kind of there.

01:46.360 --> 01:52.006
The big rooms in geology in Bolton were terrible because they were bad rooms.

01:52.586 --> 02:01.155
So the one in Meat Labs, they were bad rooms because of the way they constructed, but they weren't uncomfortable rooms, and students at least could hear you along that line.

02:02.196 --> 02:07.421
And you did not use any audio vision?

02:07.722 --> 02:09.904
I never used much of it, no.

02:09.924 --> 02:10.545
I used maps.

02:10.585 --> 02:11.946
We had hanging maps.

02:12.247 --> 02:21.777
And I took hanging mats and would hang them up on nails if they were, and then I would use a pointer, and I would frequently use those in some aspects.

02:22.017 --> 02:26.622
About when did you begin to have a TA to assist you?

02:27.463 --> 02:33.589
Well, we had graders, of course, in the early days, seniors, senior history majors.

02:34.149 --> 02:37.613
We had graders from the very beginning, way back.

02:38.453 --> 02:51.350
I'm kind of hard to remember now, but I suppose under Keith is when we began to get really a real T, and that's when the graduate program began to grow, really, during Keith's period, that we began to get teaching assistants in to help you grade.

02:52.091 --> 02:55.956
And about how large do you remember 105, 106?

02:55.996 --> 03:00.281
What would have been a typical in the 70s, 80s, 90s?

03:00.942 --> 03:03.065
Well, in the early days, they were 35, 40, 45.

03:03.285 --> 03:07.110
Then they'd go to 70, and then they'd go as much as 250.

03:07.715 --> 03:09.458
I taught as many as 250 students.

03:10.078 --> 03:16.728
But a lot of the rooms we taught in when they built Harrington, they built a bunch of rooms in there, and they were anywhere from 100 to 250.

03:17.830 --> 03:19.412
And we used those rooms extensively.

03:19.672 --> 03:24.439
When you ask where we taught, Harrington Classroom Edition was used extensively by us.

03:25.421 --> 03:28.846
And as I said, anywhere from 100 to, oh, that's not true.

03:28.866 --> 03:31.409
They had a few with 50 and 60, and we used those as well.

03:31.930 --> 03:34.534
But we used those big classrooms a lot.

03:34.554 --> 03:37.418
Now with the move to academic,

03:38.140 --> 03:43.627
Did that change parking and the departmental routine?

03:43.647 --> 03:55.884
Oh gosh, yes, it changed parking a lot because we were no longer, some are still parking in Nago, but of course those people living in Nago, Wildlife Sciences wanted those parking places, and so they got most of them in.

03:55.904 --> 03:56.985
Where did y'all then park?

03:57.906 --> 03:59.168
Oh, a variety of places in.

04:00.750 --> 04:04.435
Some were parking, some were parking there,

04:05.495 --> 04:15.966
that parking lot right near the old, what was in the exchange store, and some were parking across the street from there, and in many different places really then.

04:16.747 --> 04:24.695
Did the social life of the department change under the new department heads after Dr. Nance?

04:25.776 --> 04:32.683
We remained fairly social under Gooch and Keith Bryant.

04:33.676 --> 04:38.226
And I think actually we were, well, we were social under all of them.

04:39.329 --> 04:45.643
Because even under Hill, the person I retired under, we still had parties and things.

04:45.978 --> 04:51.327
But I think that we became more clique, more cliques involved.

04:51.888 --> 04:59.140
And we got so big that we had different groups in which they operated within themselves, partying and things like that then.

04:59.160 --> 05:01.243
Who was in your clique?

05:01.263 --> 05:07.093
Oh, Herb Lang, Garland Bayless, Claude Hall, Henry Detloff.

05:08.135 --> 05:12.542
Those had all been close friends of mine at the time, and a few other people too then.

05:12.522 --> 05:13.603
All right.

05:14.544 --> 05:17.388
Keith came as department head.

05:17.428 --> 05:20.051
Then he moved up to be dean?

05:20.071 --> 05:20.352
Dean.

05:20.412 --> 05:21.153
Moved up to be dean.

05:21.633 --> 05:22.674
And who replaces him?

05:23.736 --> 05:25.538
Detloff replaces Keith.

05:25.618 --> 05:31.525
Now how, what was the process that ended up selecting an insider instead of an outsider?

05:31.886 --> 05:33.027
Well, they went on a search.

05:33.908 --> 05:37.753
And why they did it, I don't know.

05:38.223 --> 05:41.427
Henry eventually was chosen as the head then.

05:41.827 --> 05:44.351
What was his style as department head?

05:45.632 --> 05:46.673
Pretty much hands off.

05:48.856 --> 05:54.703
Detloff is very much a gentleman and reasonably religious, I think.

05:55.524 --> 05:59.169
And I told Henry this so it's not saying anything.

06:00.751 --> 06:04.055
Henry believed you ought to do the right thing because it's the right thing.

06:04.675 --> 06:06.778
You do the right thing because it's the right thing.

06:07.096 --> 06:09.679
And I try to tell Henry as did David Stewart in English.

06:09.699 --> 06:13.504
David Stewart used to tell Henry, no, Henry, people don't do the right thing because it's the right thing.

06:13.524 --> 06:14.705
You've got to make them do the right thing.

06:15.186 --> 06:16.347
And Henry refused to do that.

06:16.888 --> 06:19.451
And to some extent, Henry lost control of the department.

06:19.471 --> 06:20.472
Let me turn that off.

06:22.114 --> 06:25.679
As I was saying, Henry was a gentleman, and he didn't believe he should lie, cheat, and steal.

06:26.119 --> 06:26.980
And he was an academician.

06:27.020 --> 06:33.188
He believed Irwin Howard was an academician, that you should do your teaching, keep office hours, do your work, and mind your own business.

06:33.728 --> 06:36.732
And he just didn't understand how people didn't do that.

06:37.488 --> 06:41.755
And I think he lost control of the department to a large extent because he didn't understand that.

06:42.416 --> 06:44.560
And by that time, the department was located?

06:44.600 --> 06:48.106
We're still an academic.

06:48.126 --> 06:48.667
Oh, okay.

06:50.009 --> 06:55.859
We moved from Nago to academic, and we stayed in academic there then, a whole of that time.

06:55.999 --> 06:59.585
We moved from academic then to the old Ag-Eco building.

07:00.487 --> 07:00.627
Mm-hmm.

07:01.045 --> 07:02.107
And that's about when?

07:02.628 --> 07:03.149
Oh, I'm sorry.

07:03.209 --> 07:03.489
No, no.

07:03.710 --> 07:04.772
We're in Harrington.

07:04.892 --> 07:05.473
We're in Harrington.

07:05.613 --> 07:06.535
We're in Harrington.

07:06.555 --> 07:07.536
We moved from Harrington.

07:08.158 --> 07:09.560
We moved from academic to Harrington.

07:09.680 --> 07:10.241
Which floor?

07:10.922 --> 07:11.403
Fifth floor.

07:11.684 --> 07:12.605
Fifth floor?

07:13.166 --> 07:17.955
Bryson Gooch was head through the academic building.

07:17.995 --> 07:21.261
I think Keith came in then and took over in the academic building.

07:21.621 --> 07:23.745
And then we moved to Harrington under Keith.

07:24.181 --> 07:32.069
And then Henry was head most of the time when we were in Harrington Tower on the fifth floor.

07:32.710 --> 07:37.735
And then Henry then was replaced Keith.

07:38.115 --> 07:39.437
And then Larry became head.

07:39.737 --> 07:44.201
And then Larry was head, replaced him by Julia Blackwilder.

07:44.261 --> 07:46.704
And under Julia Blackwilder, we moved to Ag Econ.

07:47.625 --> 07:53.631
And all right, you said that you're

07:54.050 --> 07:59.178
fear that Henry lost control of the department.

07:59.198 --> 08:01.762
Can you give any some examples of?

08:01.782 --> 08:10.896
Well, I think some of the younger members rebelled against the idea of being a head, although we still have a head, technically Julia Blackwell's head.

08:11.577 --> 08:15.122
And she runs the work, by the way, basically as a head still.

08:15.162 --> 08:18.888
And Henry was head, but Henry wouldn't use his power all the time.

08:19.449 --> 08:21.492
And so he had these people that

08:22.248 --> 08:28.174
stabbed him in the back, rebelled against him, talked against him, and he still treated him fairly.

08:29.556 --> 08:30.657
And he didn't ever punish anybody.

08:30.717 --> 08:36.903
And it's a sad thing to say, and I know this is a terrible thing for him to be saying, but some of those people need to be punished.

08:37.764 --> 08:41.408
We had people in the department who were interested only in their own career.

08:41.428 --> 08:44.451
A number of members have left now.

08:45.412 --> 08:47.935
They only cared about what they were going to do.

08:48.353 --> 08:52.340
They did not, we had a large number of people who did not care about Texas A&M University.

08:52.741 --> 08:54.464
It was a Pitts as far as they were concerned.

08:55.246 --> 08:56.789
They did not care for students.

08:57.430 --> 09:03.461
As one of my colleagues walked to my office one time and was furious because there was a book he wanted was checked out by a student.

09:03.942 --> 09:07.568
Well, I would have been pleased to think my student was checking books out and reading them, but he was furious.

09:07.588 --> 09:09.552
That's an example then.

09:09.903 --> 09:13.147
And our departmental meetings became long-winded.

09:13.228 --> 09:15.230
They became factional.

09:15.270 --> 09:18.355
They became arbitrary, backbiting.

09:18.475 --> 09:21.579
If someone wasn't there, they'd get stabbed in the back.

09:21.599 --> 09:30.531
When it came time for selecting department heads and things like that, people who would support people to their front and then oppose them behind their backs then.

09:31.152 --> 09:33.115
And that became fairly common.

09:33.555 --> 09:35.178
Our faculty meeting became really bad.

09:35.598 --> 09:36.660
No one wanted to go to them.

09:36.680 --> 09:38.442
And Henry was department head about how long?

09:38.759 --> 09:40.221
Oh, seven or eight years, I guess, yeah.

09:40.241 --> 09:41.863
And then succeeded by Larry Hill.

09:41.903 --> 09:42.704
Yeah, by Larry Hill.

09:43.204 --> 09:44.846
Is there an outside search?

09:45.327 --> 09:47.169
Is this a general search?

09:47.249 --> 09:53.877
There's a general search again, yes, but they wanted to stay in-house, I think.

09:53.917 --> 09:55.498
They weren't interested in going out, really.

09:55.719 --> 09:55.959
All right.

09:55.999 --> 09:58.722
Describe Larry's style, then.

10:01.826 --> 10:02.927
Larry was head.

10:04.628 --> 10:10.216
And Larry had a hands-off policy, more so than Henry did.

10:10.256 --> 10:16.566
If things were running smoothly, Larry didn't really care what went on.

10:19.330 --> 10:27.922
For instance, one of my serious gripes at Larry was we'd often get directives, and I told him this, and he would be saying, you're not supposed to do this and this and this.

10:28.243 --> 10:31.227
For instance, using a telephone, using supply like this.

10:32.219 --> 10:33.401
We all knew who was doing it.

10:34.022 --> 10:34.883
I wasn't doing it.

10:35.424 --> 10:36.365
Hardly anyone else was doing it.

10:36.385 --> 10:40.531
We knew who was using the phone for their personal calls and things like that.

10:40.551 --> 10:42.153
We knew who was using a lot of stationery.

10:42.834 --> 10:46.059
A lot of our attitude was don't send directives to us, you know.

10:46.500 --> 10:47.741
Tell those people who are doing it.

10:48.502 --> 10:52.528
And so to some extent Larry followed Henry's way.

10:52.568 --> 10:55.172
He left things alone.

10:55.507 --> 11:02.376
but he was more apt to send out directives about what we should not be doing, but he didn't do anything about it really basically then.

11:04.079 --> 11:05.100
Larry's not a bad head.

11:06.903 --> 11:11.269
Things ran fairly smoothly, but Larry again.

11:11.309 --> 11:23.185
The difference between Henry and Larry is that the opponents, I shouldn't use the word troublemakers, those unhappy with situations

11:23.637 --> 11:25.581
ended up having Henry's enemies.

11:26.844 --> 11:36.263
On the other hand, many of those people who were fractional and causing trouble were Larry's friends, and so things didn't, you know, things went more smoothly.

11:36.844 --> 11:45.021
And under Larry there was a great drive then to be less colloquial, to be more universal,

11:46.115 --> 11:48.699
For instance, we started discouraging master's degrees.

11:48.799 --> 11:50.261
We didn't want to do master's degrees.

11:50.762 --> 11:53.326
We want to do PhDs, and that's a fact.

11:53.606 --> 11:55.249
After the departmental meeting, we're discouraging.

11:55.830 --> 12:04.923
Whereas our bread and butter, the graduate program in the early days, as you remember, with bread and butter, was those people coming back in college, finishing up a master's degree.

12:04.943 --> 12:05.885
Well, we discourage them.

12:07.948 --> 12:12.495
I've heard it said right out in the meetings that's what it was going to be.

12:12.895 --> 12:14.097
And so we try to become...

12:14.667 --> 12:16.930
we become even more compartmentalized.

12:17.932 --> 12:32.033
And one of the ironies of that is, is that instead of we want to become strengthened and we want to become a national university, but then those areas which we might have become really big in, for instance, military science.

12:32.534 --> 12:35.258
We had Vandiver, we had Beaumont,

12:36.284 --> 12:38.712
We had a chance several times to hire some big name people.

12:39.153 --> 12:40.497
Some of those people opposed it.

12:40.517 --> 12:45.653
Some of those very people who talked in terms of let's become national, let's really become specialists.

12:46.038 --> 12:54.608
They then opposed us hiring those people where we might have become really a national power in military science, the study of military science.

12:54.628 --> 12:59.674
What, in what areas do you think the department became best known?

13:00.716 --> 13:01.817
What special fields?

13:02.218 --> 13:07.624
Military science, Texas history,

13:14.033 --> 13:19.740
Maybe some in some diplomatic, but I'm not sure anything else really.

13:21.843 --> 13:25.007
Larry, then he serves about five years?

13:25.167 --> 13:25.747
Oh, no longer.

13:25.767 --> 13:26.669
That's eight or nine years.

13:26.709 --> 13:27.690
He serves a long time.

13:27.730 --> 13:30.533
Then he is replaced by Julia Blackwell.

13:30.553 --> 13:32.115
Yes, and that was a national search.

13:32.936 --> 13:37.482
And we were told openly to hire outside.

13:39.284 --> 13:42.488
We were told we could hire inside.

13:43.345 --> 13:44.987
but it would be detrimental.

13:45.787 --> 13:49.331
So from the very beginning, we knew that we were going to go outside.

13:49.431 --> 13:54.256
And didn't the department get an extra position if they hired a female?

13:55.718 --> 13:55.818
Yeah.

13:55.838 --> 14:01.964
And if we hired within, we would lose the position.

14:01.984 --> 14:06.428
And in terms of style, how did Dr. Blackwelder compare with her predecessors?

14:06.749 --> 14:10.973
Well, Blackwelder is ahead again, and

14:12.421 --> 14:19.209
Julia consults with people but then she's much like Gucci, she does what she wants to do.

14:23.314 --> 14:37.011
I've been gone now two and a half years now but I talk to people and Julia is very pro-feminist and so the women in the apartment have got special, everything is special treatment.

14:39.725 --> 14:41.066
And that's not from one of them.

14:41.086 --> 14:42.288
I've heard that from a number of people.

14:43.489 --> 14:49.756
And lots of people think there's not much comradeship.

14:50.676 --> 14:51.798
I don't blame it on Julia.

14:51.858 --> 15:01.127
I think that earlier when we came, we had such factions involved and such cliques, that destroyed the camaraderie of the department already.

15:01.168 --> 15:02.108
That broke it down.

15:04.111 --> 15:07.694
Well, for instance, we don't have a Christmas party anymore.

15:07.855 --> 15:09.276
We have a holiday party.

15:10.589 --> 15:15.758
By that, the people in charge one year decide to have it at the Hillel Foundation, which is fine.

15:16.760 --> 15:18.142
But we get a directive from them.

15:20.446 --> 15:21.789
Jews don't believe.

15:22.750 --> 15:24.213
Jews can't eat shellfish.

15:25.595 --> 15:30.564
Therefore, it would be inappropriate for us at our party to have shellfish.

15:31.426 --> 15:33.249
You know who was mad at all people?

15:33.269 --> 15:33.930
Arnie Kramer.

15:34.501 --> 15:42.516
Because Arnie Kramer, who is Jewish background, Arnie's typical thing to bring to the Christmas party was a shrimp Christmas tree.

15:42.757 --> 15:44.100
You know, one of those things with shrimp on it.

15:44.661 --> 15:46.063
Well, we weren't supposed to bring.

15:46.364 --> 15:48.227
Well, that really bothered people.

15:48.248 --> 15:48.949
A lot of people wouldn't go.

15:49.370 --> 15:52.155
And from that time on, it just went downhill.

15:53.030 --> 15:54.974
And it ceased being a Christmas party.

15:55.495 --> 16:01.608
It becomes a holiday party or actually sometimes an end of the semester party.

16:02.791 --> 16:05.517
And it just kind of fell into disuse.

16:05.537 --> 16:07.300
It was a very big thing when you were here.

16:07.721 --> 16:08.844
We all enjoyed going.

16:08.864 --> 16:10.006
It was nice to have.

16:12.331 --> 16:13.654
I didn't care whether I went or not.

16:14.022 --> 16:16.065
Lots of times our girl and I were talking, are you going to go?

16:16.165 --> 16:17.186
I don't know if I'm going to go or not.

16:17.987 --> 16:20.610
And it just became badly attended.

16:20.630 --> 16:25.076
And also that one part of Hillel, they hired a band which played hard rock.

16:26.498 --> 16:31.023
And most of us left because we couldn't take the music.

16:31.043 --> 16:32.485
And I think that's fairly typical.

16:32.846 --> 16:34.167
Now, Julius tried to be social.

16:34.748 --> 16:40.435
Larry, at the beginning of the year, had a beginning of the year program, partied at his house ordinarily.

16:40.921 --> 16:43.944
And graduate students were invited, and we were invited.

16:44.464 --> 16:48.888
And so Larry tried to develop a social camaraderie.

16:49.949 --> 16:53.472
And I think Julia has done as well, but I think that they're poorly attended.

16:54.312 --> 17:02.840
As far as you can compare numerically, about how many people were in the department when you arrived and when you retired?

17:03.540 --> 17:07.604
Well, when I retired, what, 7, 8, 10, if you include government?

17:07.624 --> 17:09.105
No, no, no, no.

17:09.245 --> 17:10.506
When you got here?

17:10.992 --> 17:12.915
Yeah, there could have been more than eight or 10 in the department.

17:13.395 --> 17:14.557
I can name them all off, you know.

17:14.577 --> 17:15.578
What about when you retired?

17:15.598 --> 17:16.459
45.

17:16.499 --> 17:24.690
And maybe more than that if you count the peripheral ones like David Chapman who teaches courses.

17:24.710 --> 17:36.305
And when did research become to be a heavily emphasized part of the departmental evaluation system?

17:37.547 --> 17:38.468
I think under Gooch.

17:39.494 --> 17:44.479
I think by the time Gooch left, that research was a major issue.

17:45.220 --> 17:51.227
Did quality teaching lose in importance?

17:51.467 --> 17:52.368
Oh yes, I think so.

17:54.230 --> 17:59.255
I think most of the people I've ever talked to would agree with me, and it's just not me alone.

18:00.777 --> 18:08.185
They all agree that teaching is only used if it benefits the administration.

18:08.536 --> 18:09.758
if they want to use it.

18:10.640 --> 18:18.316
I think you can be a bad teacher, a bad teacher, and if you've done the research and are doing research, that's all that counts.

18:18.877 --> 18:27.895
It's research first, and then coming along way down the line is service and teaching.

18:28.212 --> 18:41.029
During all these years that you taught in the department, was it normal to try, for each faculty member, to try to do some teacher evaluation by the students?

18:41.049 --> 18:41.329
Sure.

18:41.430 --> 18:43.312
Nearly everybody did teacher evaluation.

18:43.332 --> 18:44.354
We all passed out.

18:44.374 --> 18:47.618
We all asked the students to write an evaluation.

18:47.638 --> 18:53.005
You know, we'd get a piece of paper and write on it, you know, so there couldn't be any correlation with them.

18:53.204 --> 18:58.191
Some people even worked up little surveys, you know, where they handed it out and you had to check it off.

18:59.153 --> 19:01.717
Most people I knew gave some type of thing.

19:01.737 --> 19:02.818
I did that when I was at Texas.

19:02.878 --> 19:05.522
I asked students to write my strengths and weaknesses.

19:05.542 --> 19:12.673
The thing I found amusing at that time was that so many of them liked me because I was so conservative and so many of them liked me because I was so liberal.

19:13.594 --> 19:16.098
And it gets canceled out.

19:16.118 --> 19:18.081
I distrusted the evaluations because I

19:19.529 --> 19:25.223
I deliberately set out one semester to raise my scores, and I raised them, man, I raised them.

19:26.686 --> 19:28.089
I'm not gonna ask the negative.

19:28.550 --> 19:37.251
In your almost 40 years of service in the department, which of your colleagues did you respect most for their teaching abilities?

19:38.311 --> 19:44.918
Oh, I think Herb Lang, Claude Hall, Alan Ashcraft, Haskell Monroe.

19:45.758 --> 19:50.163
Keep coming on up toward the— Gosh.

19:51.624 --> 19:52.425
Henry Detloff.

19:57.450 --> 19:58.371
Oh, good grief.

19:58.391 --> 20:01.754
I'm having a terrible time on names here, remembering everybody.

20:05.057 --> 20:06.639
David— Shobe.

20:06.919 --> 20:07.660
Shobe.

20:08.568 --> 20:16.297
And by the way, all those people not only were good teachers, I think, they also were good with their students.

20:16.317 --> 20:20.902
They kept office hours, they worked with their students, and things like that then.

20:20.922 --> 20:26.008
And I think all those people worked very hard with their students and tried to be good teachers.

20:26.909 --> 20:29.372
And they were also good colleagues, weren't they?

20:29.392 --> 20:31.394
Right, good colleagues, all of them good colleagues.

20:31.414 --> 20:35.959
Now, you didn't mention many that have come within the last 20 years.

20:37.829 --> 20:39.431
Well, it's hard for me to evaluate some.

20:39.531 --> 20:41.133
I don't know some of these people as well.

20:41.554 --> 20:46.900
I know some of them are bad teachers because I was undergraduate advisor for 10 years and I got the kickback on that.

20:47.181 --> 20:50.184
And I think there are a few of those who are good teachers.

20:50.204 --> 20:52.307
What about Ernie Kramer?

20:52.327 --> 20:53.769
I think Ernie Kramer is a good teacher.

20:54.209 --> 20:55.671
Now, you asked about people being easy.

20:55.831 --> 20:59.295
Ernie is considered to be one of the easiest people in the department.

20:59.476 --> 20:59.696
Really?

21:00.137 --> 21:05.423
If you go to class and you mind your own business, I think you're going to get by all right then.

21:05.690 --> 21:07.732
But Arnie does not pretend to be tough.

21:08.353 --> 21:11.096
And Arnie does not pretend to make his classes tough.

21:11.116 --> 21:12.958
To some extent, Arnie entertains.

21:13.959 --> 21:15.441
And he does a good job at it.

21:15.581 --> 21:19.585
And Arnie's, and I think that Arnie probably gets across a lot of the stuff he wants gets across.

21:21.768 --> 21:25.272
You became the departmental undergraduate advisor when?

21:25.532 --> 21:26.633
About 10, 12 years ago.

21:26.713 --> 21:28.315
Under whom?

21:28.716 --> 21:29.276
Under Henry.

21:30.457 --> 21:32.760
What was that, describe that task.

21:33.398 --> 21:36.603
Well, in those days, we had a lot more paperwork than we have now.

21:36.623 --> 21:38.786
I didn't have computers, so everything was done by hand.

21:39.467 --> 21:43.753
Actually, there were three of us, and I was only one of those.

21:44.293 --> 21:46.056
Claude Hall was kind of in charge.

21:47.077 --> 21:57.392
Actually, when I began, Bonnie Statham was in charge, more or less, and I became an assistant along with a guy named Fasani.

21:57.632 --> 21:58.534
You never knew Fasani.

21:58.554 --> 21:59.575
He's at Oklahoma now.

22:00.061 --> 22:03.125
And then Pasani dropped out and I became more of it.

22:03.526 --> 22:07.352
Then Claude Hall came in and he kind of headed it.

22:07.993 --> 22:10.476
And then Bonnie dropped out and left.

22:10.496 --> 22:15.984
And then I eventually came to head it along with Rosenheim and Linehan.

22:16.905 --> 22:21.933
And I kind of directed in a very general way with Rosenheim and Linehan helping.

22:22.614 --> 22:23.996
And then they would drop out.

22:24.677 --> 22:27.621
And I was doing it almost all by myself with some graduate assistants.

22:28.192 --> 22:33.225
And as the computers came in then, we did more and more with computers then.

22:33.566 --> 22:38.860
And computers made it nice in the sense that you could look things up directly then.

22:39.717 --> 22:45.483
Now, did you work with all department history majors?

22:45.703 --> 22:45.924
Yes.

22:47.485 --> 22:48.687
And what?

22:49.147 --> 22:50.388
Not graduates now.

22:50.408 --> 22:52.070
We got a separate graduate advisor.

22:52.110 --> 22:55.173
What would be their needs, concerns, worries?

22:55.414 --> 22:57.796
Primarily, what were these conversations about?

22:58.016 --> 23:00.059
Taking the right courses, fulfilling the requirements.

23:02.281 --> 23:06.045
There's a strong move on the campus right now to do with undergraduate advising.

23:06.532 --> 23:09.937
In fact, most departments are going to graduate students to do it and things like that then.

23:10.718 --> 23:14.664
The general attitude is I think that students are smart enough, they come in, they ought to be able to do it themselves.

23:14.724 --> 23:15.786
Why should you give them assistance?

23:16.206 --> 23:24.238
But my experience is even the smart ones, there were very few students who came in and told me what they were going to do.

23:26.902 --> 23:28.684
There were very few who came in who were lost.

23:29.786 --> 23:34.513
But the great middle of that weren't really sure and they needed somebody to talk to.

23:34.898 --> 23:43.848
And while it's very simple to us about what you have to take, you have to have six hours of this, six hours of that, 12 of this, it's surprising how many students aren't really worth sure.

23:44.328 --> 23:46.531
And now that, what classes could they take?

23:47.111 --> 23:49.354
And you can argue, well, all you gotta do is sit down and read the catalog.

23:50.435 --> 23:53.858
Well, I read the catalog many, many times before I understood the catalog.

23:54.719 --> 23:58.884
And I argue that it takes six months to a year before you get a decent undergraduate advisor.

23:59.444 --> 24:02.728
If it takes me six months to a year to understand the catalog,

24:03.181 --> 24:05.503
Because the catalog is ambiguous in places.

24:06.184 --> 24:10.007
Well, how long is it going to take a 18, 19-year-old sophomore to understand it?

24:10.508 --> 24:15.633
And so I strongly believe that, and we always thought that this made A&M different.

24:15.713 --> 24:18.876
A&M supposedly cares about the students, and we're different.

24:19.076 --> 24:22.980
We take students in, and we help them, and we're student-oriented.

24:23.440 --> 24:31.888
But I'm afraid, and I told one of my good friends and my wife's chairman of her board was on the

24:32.594 --> 24:37.361
the president's council, and I told him that all this talk about advising students is for the birds.

24:37.661 --> 24:43.869
He better be aware of it, that they really don't care that much, and undergraduate advising has really gone down.

24:44.130 --> 24:51.780
From the days Claude Hall was doing it, others were doing it, I was doing it, where we sat down with a student, went through their program, and that sort of thing.

24:52.521 --> 25:01.133
Now normally you, once you accepted that role, your teaching load and your advising load was what?

25:01.433 --> 25:04.237
Well, you had a reduced course.

25:04.257 --> 25:07.301
And as time went on, that was reduced more because we were spending more and more time.

25:08.022 --> 25:09.664
And we had more and more.

25:09.684 --> 25:11.567
We had 400 undergraduates.

25:11.587 --> 25:12.188
One section?

25:12.208 --> 25:17.375
I got one section in summertime and two in the regular semester.

25:17.395 --> 25:20.639
And you would be in the office from 8 to 5?

25:20.980 --> 25:21.220
No.

25:21.901 --> 25:22.642
I kept hours.

25:23.143 --> 25:26.968
I was there all day.

25:27.860 --> 25:30.685
several days, and then I was there part-time.

25:31.165 --> 25:32.828
It depends on how many advisors we had.

25:33.329 --> 25:37.355
If I was the only one doing it, as I was for a while, then I was there almost all the time.

25:38.096 --> 25:46.169
If we had other people like when others were doing it, then we looked at each other, we talked about it, and we traded off to where there was somebody there 40 hours a week then.

25:46.810 --> 25:54.222
Give examples of some of the serious and the goofy problems that you encountered with these students.

25:54.691 --> 25:57.875
I had a girl come in and sit down.

25:58.496 --> 26:02.601
By the time she left, I was going to have to get a rug cleaner to mop up the water.

26:02.621 --> 26:03.402
She cried so much.

26:04.403 --> 26:08.428
She had somehow or another gotten the idea that only 30 hours were required.

26:08.528 --> 26:10.250
She only had 30 hours of history.

26:11.572 --> 26:14.175
She had a job waiting for her and that sort of thing.

26:14.435 --> 26:15.476
We had to work with that.

26:15.496 --> 26:22.224
I talked to Julia about it.

26:22.605 --> 26:24.327
We finally decided to let her go.

26:24.965 --> 26:37.277
The dean of the college for a good while there was Woodrow Jones, and whether it was Woody's idea or not, whether he was the one who came up with the idea, we wanted to graduate people.

26:38.078 --> 26:45.325
Unless there was really a good reason why, we weren't going to keep anyone from graduating for small reasons.

26:45.986 --> 26:46.566
Graduate them.

26:47.227 --> 26:53.233
And so she had everything else in the world, and so we found three hours, converted, and graduated her.

26:53.720 --> 27:01.289
Another one I had was a guy was trying to graduate and he had gotten the idea that he didn't need six hours of math.

27:02.691 --> 27:05.254
He had to take it, but he didn't have to pass it.

27:05.314 --> 27:05.915
I'm serious.

27:06.475 --> 27:09.099
He had taken six hours of math and flunked it.

27:09.739 --> 27:12.403
The catalog says you must take six hours of math.

27:16.307 --> 27:20.132
I'm sitting there looking at him, just aghast, you know.

27:20.467 --> 27:24.733
Well, we didn't make any exception there, and he had to go take it.

27:25.214 --> 27:28.719
And he never passed it A&M, and so he was going to take it someplace else.

27:28.739 --> 27:31.923
And so that's one of those wild stories here about how can you believe that.

27:32.284 --> 27:34.787
Well, I took it, but I didn't pass it then.

27:34.827 --> 27:36.550
So those are kind of extreme cases.

27:37.271 --> 27:44.801
Did any student or anyone in the student's behalf ever attempt to offer money or influence?

27:44.901 --> 27:45.142
Oh, yes.

27:46.243 --> 27:50.389
I'd do anything, you know, what can I do for you and things like that then.

27:50.723 --> 27:53.526
That was more common in the past than it was in the present.

27:53.547 --> 27:55.469
I had very little of that the last bit.

27:55.970 --> 27:59.714
But back in the 70s, I think, and in the middle 80s, there was a lot of that.

28:00.015 --> 28:01.056
Well, I say a lot of it.

28:01.316 --> 28:02.418
It certainly went on, yes.

28:02.818 --> 28:05.081
Did anybody offer you, say, a trip somewhere?

28:05.942 --> 28:11.028
No, but I was offered do anything, you know, how can I help you, what can I do, you know, and things like that.

28:11.749 --> 28:14.192
Did any, no board member, no?

28:14.813 --> 28:20.460
I never had a board member in any way interfere with me, yes, uh-huh.

28:20.609 --> 28:23.194
anybody in the higher administration on campus?

28:24.197 --> 28:24.517
Yes.

28:25.459 --> 28:31.171
I had, uh, we had a dean of men here for a while.

28:31.251 --> 28:36.122
He didn't stay very long, by the way, who called me a number of times trying to influence me on things.

28:36.482 --> 28:38.507
And he was only here a semester and then he was gone.

28:39.028 --> 28:41.132
So I got, he did that to some other people as well.

28:41.534 --> 28:44.598
But that's the only real one I remember.

28:44.939 --> 28:47.802
Did the Corps ever try to get special?

28:48.503 --> 28:51.588
Oh, the Corps was always calling about people and things like that.

28:52.228 --> 29:00.720
And I had a few times where Trigon officers called and talked about certain people, but never any open bribes.

29:01.160 --> 29:02.542
What about athletics?

29:02.562 --> 29:05.126
Yeah, had a few were on athletics, yeah.

29:06.247 --> 29:07.449
That's a long time ago, too.

29:08.190 --> 29:10.373
It was generally the counselor.

29:11.114 --> 29:11.254
Mm-hmm.

29:11.926 --> 29:17.333
And I don't remember ever having a coach call me, but I had counselors talk to me.

29:18.294 --> 29:20.557
That's after Bud Denton, because Bud Denton never did it.

29:21.558 --> 29:26.344
Let's see, women colleagues in the department, who was the pioneer?

29:31.290 --> 29:31.791
Was Bonnie?

29:32.392 --> 29:33.093
No, no, no.

29:35.175 --> 29:39.621
We had a woman here who taught part, who taught in the department

29:40.006 --> 29:43.471
whose husband, and she taught in the apartment when we were in Nagel.

29:44.151 --> 29:46.515
Red-haired lady, I don't remember her name now.

29:47.195 --> 29:52.062
And she was in the apartment, and she taught for several years after I was here, and I do not remember her name then.

29:52.943 --> 29:54.826
And then... Then Bonnie.

29:55.266 --> 29:55.647
Bonnie.

29:56.428 --> 30:04.999
And then... All right, now Bonnie has always thought of herself as the pioneer female on the campus almost.

30:05.019 --> 30:05.560
Isn't that correct?

30:05.580 --> 30:06.040
That's not true.

30:06.080 --> 30:06.701
No, there were other women.

30:06.721 --> 30:08.123
No, but... Yeah.

30:08.103 --> 30:14.412
They had several women in modern languages and in English, you know.

30:14.592 --> 30:16.715
Do you remember any problems?

30:17.536 --> 30:18.237
No.

30:18.257 --> 30:19.860
I don't remember any.

30:20.400 --> 30:25.488
As I said, we had the lady who taught for several years in the department.

30:26.068 --> 30:27.731
I'm not sure she was ever full-time.

30:27.991 --> 30:30.735
I don't think she was tenured, but nevertheless she taught.

30:32.032 --> 30:40.902
Among the deans, how would you rate them in leading the College of Liberal Arts?

30:41.603 --> 30:45.468
Well, Hubert was a good dean, and Hubert had his faults, undoubtedly.

30:46.028 --> 30:50.834
But Hubert ran a taut ship, but you know where you stood, and things ran smoothly.

30:52.096 --> 30:53.277
Hubert was the old school.

30:55.039 --> 31:00.165
But we have not had a good dean.

31:01.428 --> 31:02.509
since then.

31:03.490 --> 31:09.917
Maxwell was high-handed, stabbed in the back, dictatorial.

31:12.099 --> 31:12.860
So was Keefe.

31:15.042 --> 31:22.230
The following dean was no better, and I think Jones has tried to be a good dean.

31:22.931 --> 31:29.798
I think of those deans, of the ones I've talked about, he's tried to be a good dean, but his temper

31:30.706 --> 31:32.831
and things like that have gotten in the way.

31:33.613 --> 31:46.622
Among the other deans at that time on the campus, which dean do you think had the highest status with his colleagues?

31:48.475 --> 31:52.759
Well, I'm sure Maxwell had high status with economics because he took care of them.

31:52.779 --> 31:53.400
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

31:53.420 --> 31:55.502
With his, I mean, with his dean colleagues.

31:56.923 --> 32:02.889
Which arts and sciences or liberal arts dean did the other deans?

32:02.909 --> 32:04.230
Well, I think it would be Hubert probably.

32:04.971 --> 32:06.152
No doubt in my mind Hubert.

32:06.172 --> 32:08.074
I don't think any of the deans probably had any high stature.

32:09.495 --> 32:10.676
That would have been my guess too.

32:11.277 --> 32:12.177
I don't think so, no.

32:12.838 --> 32:17.082
And I think some of them, Maxwell always fought the wrong battle

32:19.458 --> 32:21.581
Keith didn't fight any battles.

32:23.624 --> 32:39.407
His successor did his own thing pretty much and had his own ideas and I think Woody had just simply been handicapped by health problems and that sort of thing and very violent.
