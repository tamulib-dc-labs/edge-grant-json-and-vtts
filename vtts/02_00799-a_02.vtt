WEBVTT

00:02.731 --> 00:04.333
Were there any other characters like him?

00:07.316 --> 00:08.818
Not like Dr. Wharton. There were no other 
characters like Dr. Wharton. He was something

00:13.883 --> 00:15.445
else. You couldn't help but admire the man.

00:22.553 --> 00:24.235
He was a good- In what way? Because of his memory? 
Because of his knowledge? He had the knowledge,

00:26.557 --> 00:28.359
yes. He knew. He was too busy otherwise with his 
personal affairs to bother with you. Unless you

00:37.403 --> 00:41.188
ask him a specific question.

00:43.250 --> 00:44.151
He was there with you. What did the administration 
think of his personal affairs? They didn't care

00:49.158 --> 00:52.141
for that so much, did they, back in the 1930s? His 
first wife died. He made a statement. And that

00:59.802 --> 01:03.748
statement got out to the president. It got back to 
him. Quickly. Yeah, real quickly. So Dr. Wharton

01:10.277 --> 01:11.879
came in. What was his statement? Well,

01:13.902 --> 01:23.335
this was her death he talked about. This was 
something that he had devoutly wished for. or

01:27.477 --> 01:29.019
something like that. Anyhow, that's what I heard. 
He didn't tell me. But anyway, he had his, I think it

01:36.266 --> 01:47.538
was a Form 501 in those days that they issued when 
they fired you. When he came in that morning, that

01:47.578 --> 01:51.082
thing was on his desk. It was on a Saturday morning. 
as I recall, and I was his graduate assistant that

01:55.034 --> 01:59.198
year. This was in 35, wasn't it? So I

02:02.661 --> 02:08.387
didn't see him for a while. And finally, Dr. 
Marsdell got a hold of me, said, we don't have any

02:08.507 --> 02:15.474
grades for those seniors. And the grades are 
supposed to be in today. Will you try to find Dr.

02:19.978 --> 02:24.062
Wharton, get him to grade those papers? turn in 
those grades before 5 o'clock. So these seniors

02:27.897 --> 02:35.187
can, these students can, well, it wasn't 
graduation anyway. They had to have the grades in

02:35.768 --> 02:38.972
by 5. That was the deadline anyway. I found Dr. 
Wharton. He was in the old baron's tavern in Bryan

02:44.340 --> 02:49.407
drinking beer. So he said, John, I am no longer on 
the faculty at A&M, and if Dr. Marsteller wants

02:55.480 --> 03:04.791
those papers graded, he can grade them himself. I 
said, I don't care what he does with them. Well, I

03:08.836 --> 03:13.001
told Dr. Marsteller, Dr. Wharton is not going to 
grade the papers. He said, well, you get up there

03:13.021 --> 03:16.645
and grade those papers and turn in the grade for 
them. Well, I went up to the lab, and his office was

03:17.666 --> 03:23.293
in the laboratory. in one corner of the lab. So I 
graded the papers and got their grades in. I graded

03:30.404 --> 03:32.106
them as best I could. Old Dr. Wharton told me that 
morning, he said, John, if you ever go to work for

03:33.888 --> 03:41.978
Texas A&M, I'm going to cut your GD throat. Really? 
Ruth heard it. She was sitting in the car. The old

03:47.005 --> 03:47.686
brother. What happened to them and them? Hm? What 
happened to Wharton and them? He went to San

03:54.239 --> 04:01.745
Antonio and became chief of meat inspection for 
the city of San Antonio. And then he had eight wives

04:01.765 --> 04:03.787
after that? Well, he had gone through the second 
wife here. I thought you said the first one died.

04:10.993 --> 04:12.294
Well, his first one died. And that's when he got 
fired for making this statement? Well, he had

04:14.957 --> 04:21.862
married to another one before this first one died. 
Oh, really? See, they were divorced. Well, he and

04:24.884 --> 04:33.836
the second one

04:24.884 --> 04:33.836
didn't get along any better than he and the first 
one. So I was in lab one morning, and this second

04:33.917 --> 04:39.725
wife came in. She had on a great big picture hat, you 
know, one of those wide-brimmed things. She had it

04:45.332 --> 04:52.242
pulled down over one of her eyes, and she was 
looking for Dr. Horton. Dr. Wharton, not here. She

04:56.076 --> 05:01.284
said, well, I am going to have to leave him. I cannot 
live with him. Well, by that time, she had raised

05:04.688 --> 05:09.875
that hat up enough I could see that big black eye. 
Oh, really? I found out then that she had been down

05:11.798 --> 05:17.366
at old Ed Hardlick's. That was Uncle Ed's place. 
You've heard about that. I think it's... It's Fish

05:23.204 --> 05:26.187
Richards now down in there. That's where the 
students always hung out and drank their beers on.

05:30.973 --> 05:44.208
Well, anyway, the night before, Dr. Wharton had 
been to a meeting of the junior chapter of the

05:30.973 --> 05:44.208
American Binaural Medical Association. He was 
sponsor. It was in the old amphitheater at Francis

05:46.051 --> 05:48.473
Hall. Someone came in and said something to him. 
Doc just stayed in the group until the meeting was

05:52.448 --> 05:57.675
over, and then he left. He stopped by Ed 
Hardlicker's. When he went in, his wife was

06:02.602 --> 06:06.408
sitting at a table. And he just walked right on by 
her and down to the bar, got a beer. Well, before he

06:16.783 --> 06:19.266
finished that bottle of beer, Someone came and 
tapped him on the shoulder and said, Doc, your wife

06:20.056 --> 06:24.662
just fell out of the chair. She's on the floor back 
there, drunk.

06:30.910 --> 06:34.975
So Doc said, well, pick her up. You saw her first. 
Well, this old boy went back, picked her up, and

06:37.078 --> 06:41.423
took her out and put her in Doc's car in the front 
seat. Doc went ahead and finished his beer. I don't

06:44.736 --> 06:47.678
know whether he had another one or two or what. But 
anyway, when he went out, she was lying there in the

06:47.698 --> 06:54.625
front seat, you know, head back on the back of the 
seat. She was out. But when Doc got in the car, his

06:57.087 --> 07:00.550
wife awakened. Well, she knew that he kept a pistol 
in the pocket, in the car pocket, on the dash

07:01.811 --> 07:09.378
pocket. So she tried to get it. And when she tried 
it, he hit her in her eye. That's when he hit her in

07:15.922 --> 07:19.827
that left eye. Knocked her loose from it. And 
that's where the big black eye came from. So

07:28.578 --> 07:33.884
anyhow, he was canned. He was fired. As his 
assistant, were you sorry to see him go? Well, yes,

07:42.946 --> 07:45.129
I liked old Doc. He and I got along all right. I 
didn't take anything off of him. I didn't give him

07:49.134 --> 07:51.476
anything to take either. Because I was just a 
graduate assistant, and I did what I was told. And

07:58.605 --> 08:01.108
did the best I could with the students. I tried to 
give them something when they came to class.

08:08.297 --> 08:10.379
But that's the reason. I had no pathology. to 
amount to anything. That's the reason that Ruth

08:13.769 --> 08:25.727
and I went to Ann Arbor to University of Michigan 
Medical School and we took every course they had,

08:13.769 --> 08:25.727
graduate and undergraduate, in pathology. So I 
figured that I would go on teaching pathology.

08:36.022 --> 08:41.590
And I could tell you that we had nothing, we had no 
material for microscopic work whatsoever all

08:41.975 --> 09:10.227
that had been thrown out so i began in in the from 
1936 to 1941

08:41.975 --> 09:10.227
when i went into anatomy i had prepared over 400 
class sets of various diseases i

08:41.975 --> 09:10.227
had no technician i had to do all that i was the only 
one in pathology I did all of the post-mortem work

09:10.679 --> 09:15.266
for the College of Veterinary Medicine. I 
preserved all the gross specimens. I made I don't

09:17.650 --> 09:32.072
know how many museum jars that we fixed up on, so 
Ruth would go out with me, that we would fix up on

09:17.650 --> 09:32.072
Sundays, prepare these specimens for class work. 
And sectioning tissue. Well, you gave all the

09:36.515 --> 09:38.458
lectures. You graded all the papers. You did all 
the, you were the only one. And one semester in

09:43.265 --> 09:50.656
there, the pathology department was combined 
with bacteriology. It was pathology and

09:50.676 --> 09:53.881
bacteriology. Then it placed under Dr. Dunn, who 
later became dean. There was one semester, Dr.

09:59.730 --> 10:03.315
Dunn was sick. He was out the entire semester. This 
was about 38, 39, 38, 39, somewhere in there. Well,

10:12.027 --> 10:20.441
we got old Dr. Van Valkenburg to come down and 
handle the immunology. And I had all of the path and

10:21.663 --> 10:26.711
all of the bacteriology. Well, now, if you can 
imagine, I section tissue, prepare material for

10:30.768 --> 10:37.081
classwork and pathology, laboratory work and 
pathology. I am doing all the post-mortem work. I

10:40.087 --> 10:47.882
have to keep, I don't know how many different 
cultures of bacteria we had, but you have to

10:40.087 --> 10:47.882
transfer and keep everything going. You have to 
make up all the special medias and so on for

10:48.082 --> 11:00.920
detection of carbohydrates and so on, gas 
fermentation and what have you, blood media and

10:48.082 --> 11:00.920
what have you. You have to do all that yourself.

11:05.567 --> 11:07.429
That was one semester. Dr. Dunn, I didn't see him 
from the beginning of the semester to the last of

11:07.449 --> 11:12.997
the semester. I was handling everything in 
bacteriology and pathology. except immunology.

11:21.511 --> 11:23.674
Dr. Van Valkenburg took it.

11:27.659 --> 11:29.001
I got a thank you.

11:31.904 --> 11:37.171
And that was $1,800 on a nine-month basis. And 
people bellyache now about having to work so much.

11:43.859 --> 11:47.063
I have one last question about Dr. Wharton. It 
appears that to you, is it true that he was then

11:47.583 --> 11:52.690
fired because of his private life? Well, I think 
more private life than anything else. Not because

11:57.075 --> 11:59.138
of his professional life? No, I don't think so. 
What did the staff, what did your colleagues and

12:01.021 --> 12:12.055
yourself think about the fact that he was fired 
because of his private life and not because of his

12:01.021 --> 12:12.055
professional life? I don't know what they thought 
about him. I really don't. They probably had the

12:16.464 --> 12:20.390
same feeling that I had, that he deserved it. I 
wouldn't have wanted him on the staff the way

12:21.752 --> 12:27.421
things were. In fact, it may have been a repeat 
later on. I don't know. I'm not going to send

12:34.232 --> 12:36.676
anybody. But anyway. What do you mean a repeat? No, 
I had to fire a person. Oh, yeah? In fact, I fired

12:46.646 --> 12:48.067
two.

12:51.630 --> 12:52.731
In the 50s? No, no. This was way later in anatomy.

12:58.757 --> 13:00.098
Well, there was one. I inherited one when I went in 
the department.

13:07.886 --> 13:10.408
He admitted that he was a misfit.

13:13.713 --> 13:24.007
He would like to have gone on in human medicine, and 
it was an embarrassment to him that he was in

13:13.713 --> 13:24.007
veterinary medicine. I said, well, if that's the 
way you feel about it, then you don't deserve to be

13:24.027 --> 13:31.076
in here with veterinary students. If you don't 
think that veterinary medicine is the only

13:31.097 --> 13:39.888
profession in the world, you don't deserve to be in 
here teaching. I don't want you. And so

13:44.425 --> 13:55.056
I went on over to Dr. Marsteller's office and told 
him to fill out a form 501 for him. Well, this old boy

13:56.838 --> 14:03.144
went to Dr. Marsteller that same morning, well, 
within the hour. And Dr. Marsteller said, unless

14:03.204 --> 14:10.452
you can patch it up with Dr. Melliff, why, I'm going 
to have to let you go. Because he's already been by

14:11.613 --> 14:13.555
here. I'll fill out this form to fire you.

14:22.418 --> 14:24.220
This fella came up and talked to me. I said, well, 
I'll try you the remainder of the semester. And

14:30.346 --> 14:40.937
unless you change your mind about veterinary 
medicine by September, you better be in another

14:30.346 --> 14:40.937
position somewhere else. I'll give you this 
summer. to look around. You'll be on salary this

14:45.298 --> 14:49.402
summer, but you can look around and find you 
another place. Well, that summer, he decided he'd

14:51.805 --> 14:54.968
go on back to medical. He'd go to medical school, 
and he did. He went to St. Louis University School

14:57.490 --> 15:01.134
of Medicine. What he did, he stayed two years and 
quit, and still he's practicing veterinary

15:02.315 --> 15:08.601
medicine to this day. He is. Yeah. He doesn't like 
human medicine either. He thought that was it.

15:15.167 --> 15:16.929
What about the other one, the other person? Well, 
the other one is still living. And I hope he's doing

15:20.072 --> 15:23.295
well. But he just had too many

15:24.756 --> 15:35.847
things to do with the opposite sex. And he was 
married and a family and so on. So we had a trial. and

15:42.837 --> 16:12.456
this led to the establishment of dismissal 
procedures following the aup's recommendations

15:42.837 --> 16:12.456
i'm sure about when was this this was in the late 60s 
it took three years to set it up but we had a trial

15:42.837 --> 16:12.456
with jury lawyers and everything he had lawyers 
and the nm had lawyers but i hope that now with their

15:42.837 --> 16:12.456
committee on grievances or whatever it is There is 
a faculty committed to look into a dismissal of a

16:12.993 --> 16:18.379
person. And it has to be on firm ground. You can't 
just fire a man because you don't like him. That's

16:29.592 --> 16:32.495
the way it was before this was set up. And I guess 
it's a good thing that it was set up. But in those

16:36.420 --> 16:41.886
days, before we ever had it, I didn't know any 
mistreatment of an individual if he did his work.

16:49.189 --> 16:59.358
I don't think Wharton would have ever been fired if 
he hadn't just,

16:49.189 --> 16:59.358
well, it was too glaring. It was too obvious of what 
he was doing. He made no big secret of it. But he

17:04.943 --> 17:09.166
never did bring anything on the campus.

17:10.107 --> 17:12.109
All of his dirty work, I would say, was done off the 
campus. But

17:17.350 --> 17:25.880
his name attached to A&M wasn't good for A&M. That 
was it. In the war and until 1969, you were head of

17:29.464 --> 17:34.430
the Department of Vet and Anatomy. Yeah. It was the 
same thing when I went into Veterinary Anatomy. We

17:39.155 --> 17:39.936
had nothing. Okay, I'd like to talk about those 
changes. So, Dr. Mundink was head of the

17:43.585 --> 17:51.035
department, left, went with Latterly 
Laboratories. Dr. Rubin had come here two years

17:52.056 --> 17:56.262
before with Dr. Mundink. So, Rubin and I were, 
well, Dr. Lange, L-A-N-G-E, called it Lange. Dr.

18:07.757 --> 18:08.758
Lange was here then too, Dr. Longy and Dr. Rubin. 
And Dr. Longy had the idea, so he told me that he

18:14.005 --> 18:21.632
should have been made head of department instead 
of me.

18:25.456 --> 18:30.241
In fact, they look around and they get this younger 
person. So he told me that this younger person,

18:30.381 --> 18:38.830
this snip, to take the headship when he had been in 
the department for two years. He actually should

18:39.299 --> 18:44.065
have been made head of department. Well, that was 
the beginning. Actually, I was older than Lang, as

18:45.226 --> 18:50.152
I call him, Lang, instead of Longy. I was older than 
he was, but he didn't know it. And I had had more

18:54.517 --> 18:57.260
education than Dr. Lang. In fact, I had two more 
degrees at that time than Dr. Lang had. So, well,

19:08.105 --> 19:12.770
he's the one who I had to let go. And our differences 
began right about that time. When I went into the

19:18.937 --> 19:24.404
department, he was so unhappy because he wasn't 
made head of department. And that's what he told

19:24.884 --> 19:26.166
me. So I called him one day down. I called up one day 
down there. I don't know. I had a question,

19:33.494 --> 19:36.998
something I wanted to ask you if it was. down there, 
or had I overlooked it in Francis Hall. We had the

19:41.522 --> 19:46.149
little two-story building, which is in civil 
engineering now. It was the anatomy lab. He was

19:47.471 --> 19:51.417
down there, and I was up on the hill, as we called it, 
at Francis Hall. No, he didn't know where it was,

19:52.659 --> 19:57.226
and so on, and so on. He gave me a piece of his mind 
then. for calling him up. He was in class, didn't

20:02.310 --> 20:05.212
want to be disturbed. I said, where are you? So 
that's when I went down to see him. I said, you just

20:15.101 --> 20:22.107
stay right there till I get there, because we're 
going to have some words.

20:22.127 --> 20:24.109
I went down there, and he was in class. He kept on 
lecturing. I just stood in the door, watched him a

20:25.710 --> 20:28.753
while. He didn't even look my way. He knew I was 
there. That's when I went on over to Dr. Marsteller

20:34.325 --> 20:40.031
and told him to fill out the 501 for him. I wasn't 
going to put up with him. But he came and talked to

20:44.676 --> 20:46.898
me, as I said. And we patched it up. He stayed on 
until the end of the summer. Then went back to

20:53.845 --> 20:55.646
medical school. Went to medical school. There 
must have been a great change in curriculum while

20:58.147 --> 21:03.916
you were department head. Well, we added courses. 
I think the big change was in the improvement of

21:05.518 --> 21:11.767
teaching. OK. Let's talk about that. Why did it 
improve? Well, it improved because

21:18.617 --> 21:27.951
we were endeavoring to build up a department. from 
nothing. And we had it. There was no way to go but up.

21:34.509 --> 21:37.834
And unless you went up, you might as well quit. It 
was just that bad. So we began improving our

21:42.641 --> 21:50.011
teaching methods. We began to get materials that 
would allow us to present our subject to the

21:54.779 --> 21:59.884
students in a much better way. Projectors and such 
as that and microscopes. Lord, we needed

22:05.170 --> 22:07.672
everything. And laboratory tables and chairs and 
you name it, we needed it. Because we didn't have

22:15.240 --> 22:17.622
anything. We were down to what we could rake and 
scrape out of a basement. And that was about it.

22:27.455 --> 22:35.264
Microscopes, the big thing at first, we had no 
trouble getting animals for gross dissection. In

22:35.984 --> 22:38.848
fact, I don't believe we ever had any trouble. Dr. 
Francis didn't seem to have trouble getting live

22:38.888 --> 22:46.656
material for gross dissection. embalming, 
preparation specimen, wet specimen material. He

22:52.365 --> 22:53.406
had no trouble. But it was in the microscopic part. 
Embryology, we had nothing. And we had to order

23:01.797 --> 23:13.892
most of our embryology material because it was an 
impossibility for me, as head of department and

23:01.797 --> 23:13.892
technician too, to make histology material and 
embryology material, too, because making

23:14.868 --> 23:30.985
embryology slide serial sections is much harder 
work than just cutting sections for histology,

23:14.868 --> 23:30.985
where you just put one section on the slide. If you 
have to have a 24-hour chick serial sections all on

23:31.325 --> 23:43.778
one slide, that's much more difficult.

23:44.180 --> 23:46.863
We ordered most of the embryology material. We 
bought a 600 egg incubator. We would start out

23:52.088 --> 23:58.535
hatching with eggs and break eggs every day and 
watch the development. This was for embryology.

24:00.837 --> 24:06.302
And then when the chicks hatched out, we usually 
have several hundred chicks. We would sex them. I

24:07.704 --> 24:12.769
learned to sex chicks, baby chicks, one day old. We 
had lots of fun that way. And then usually, just as

24:14.644 --> 24:25.195
an aside, we would separate the cocks from the 
hens, from the pullets. And one boy would take all

24:25.375 --> 24:38.469
the cocks, and another one would take the hens, and 
we'd raise them all up to frying size and check, see

24:25.375 --> 24:38.469
how good we were in sexing. See how many hens we had 
over there with the roosters. Well, when they got

24:42.961 --> 24:46.686
up to be frying sides, we always had a big barbecue.

24:49.770 --> 24:53.895
The class was out here, out that old patio out 
there. Really? Right out there? Yeah, right out

24:54.535 --> 24:55.356
there. And so they usually bring a keg of beer. I 
wouldn't have anything to do with it, but they'd

25:00.843 --> 25:04.367
have a keg of beer out there somewhere. We'd have a 
big chicken barbecue. Great. Big deal, yeah. Lots

25:08.853 --> 25:09.874
of fun. Of course, these were older students. But 
it paid off. But I don't know. Altogether, in

25:19.320 --> 25:32.258
histology in those years, when I had no 
technician, I don't know how many class sets I

25:19.320 --> 25:32.258
prepared.

25:32.438 --> 25:38.106
In pathology, I had over 400 sets when I left there. 
And I don't suppose there's a veterinary college

25:38.828 --> 25:50.783
in this country that could equal our collection in 
histology and embryology and neuroanatomy now.

25:52.224 --> 25:54.006
And I did most of the sectioning. I had help from 
1955 on. But the help that I got had to be taught. And

26:02.577 --> 26:07.603
so there was a period of years when actually,

26:08.444 --> 26:14.631
I was still doing most of the technical help 
because I was teaching the person I had hired. You

26:15.512 --> 26:16.733
couldn't hire anybody else. You didn't have money 
enough to hire a graduate technician. So as a

26:22.499 --> 26:28.326
consequence, we found a person who was willing to 
work, a good worker. She was working over there at

26:29.267 --> 26:37.776
Black's Pharmacy on Old Jones Pharmacy now, or 
whatever. I taught her, and she got to be, I guess,

26:38.077 --> 26:46.667
she was about the best tissue technician on the 
campus. She's retired now from A&M, but she was

26:46.687 --> 26:57.038
with me from then on until I retired in 71. A good 
technician, and I don't have any others she

26:57.178 --> 27:02.244
taught. For years, you were chairman of the 
Student Selections Committee. Yes. That was one

27:07.895 --> 27:11.781
of your important committee jobs. Could you 
describe this election process? And did it change

27:15.827 --> 27:18.251
over the years? I couldn't tell you whether it has 
changed very much or not now because I haven't kept

27:18.631 --> 27:24.761
up with it. But in those days, we tried to evaluate 
the student as best we could. We looked at

27:31.331 --> 27:35.978
everything that we had on that student. His 
transcript was the big thing, what he had done in

27:36.785 --> 27:42.934
his college work. This was in the 1940s and 1950s? 
Well, this was in the 50s. Back in the 40s, Dr. Dunn

27:49.885 --> 27:54.652
was chairman of the committee. And he had a way of 
evaluating, too. They had a sort of a score method,

27:58.157 --> 28:02.303
so many points if he had a year on the farm, and so 
many points if he belonged to the 4-H group, and so

28:02.705 --> 28:10.014
on and so on. And so you totaled up your score to 
evaluate the students. But we went more on the

28:16.702 --> 28:23.530
transcript, on his college record, what he had to 
show us. There's so much that can be learned from a

28:25.132 --> 28:32.661
transcript, but just besides grades.

28:33.637 --> 28:36.702
whether the student stayed with what he started 
out. In my own instance, I began with EE, and I

28:37.743 --> 28:44.293
changed to biology, and then I changed to 
veterinary medicine. Well, I don't know whether I

28:44.333 --> 28:50.262
would have thought very much of that in evaluating 
me or not. Because I just hadn't made up my mind. I

28:56.331 --> 29:00.657
was a little bit too changeable. And I dropped some 
courses and so on. Well, that didn't speak well for

29:04.913 --> 29:10.280
a student in his evaluation. If he started out in 
veterinary medicine, then he had his mind made up.

29:16.308 --> 29:23.758
If he started out in pre-vet, he had his mind made up 
back yonder that veterinary medicine was

29:16.308 --> 29:23.758
actually what he wanted. You had to find out 
something about motivation, whether he really

29:23.878 --> 29:31.048
wanted it and how long he had wanted it and so on. How 
did you find out about that? Didn't you have

29:32.394 --> 29:33.335
interviews? Oh, yes. You had interviews. What 
were the important questions during the

29:35.477 --> 29:37.659
interviews? The important questions on his 
coursework and on his life up to the time. And, of

29:45.146 --> 29:52.612
course, we had letters from various persons, 
letters of recommendation. But those things

29:53.853 --> 30:01.120
couldn't always

29:53.853 --> 30:01.120
be taken. face value. Perhaps you know yourself, 
if you've ever written a letter of

30:04.886 --> 30:14.837
recommendation, you've tried to avoid saying 
anything that might be derogatory. Well, another

30:16.178 --> 30:26.550
thing about our selection from the time that Al 
Price became dean, we had to have everything so

30:28.319 --> 30:35.069
that whatever we decided about a student would 
stand up in court. Absolutely. You didn't just...

30:39.635 --> 30:40.056
When was this? When did this come about? Well, this 
was from the time that Al Price became dean only.

30:49.589 --> 30:49.970
Why? Why did they change the policy?

30:54.857 --> 30:57.280
You can be hailed into court now any student can 
take you into court anytime he wants to the way

30:57.884 --> 31:15.015
things are going now you see that every day

30:57.884 --> 31:15.015
lawsuits so unless you have it in black and white

31:19.754 --> 31:22.819
You just better not draw it off the top of your head. 
And just because you think something is so, you

31:22.919 --> 31:31.152
better know it for sure. So the graves were the big 
things that you had to go on. This was all in black

31:35.739 --> 31:38.363
and white. This is a record. And it's a record that 
you can take into court.

31:47.800 --> 31:52.286
Do you remember any law cases against the 
Selections Committee? No, I don't recall any. I

31:55.750 --> 31:57.172
think we've been threatened. But I know I never had 
to appear. You know, during the, over the years,

32:02.158 --> 32:09.167
from the mid-30s to the mid-60s, the requirements 
and the number of...
