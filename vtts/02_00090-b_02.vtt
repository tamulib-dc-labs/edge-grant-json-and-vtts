WEBVTT

00:02.225 --> 00:12.820
And I don't know what she charged, but she was 
making some nickels and dimes for the two. And I

00:12.840 --> 00:19.530
recall that Darnell, she wasn't no fancy dresser 
or anything. They had some glad rags I guess you'd

00:19.550 --> 00:22.875
call it. You know, studying all the time.

00:32.161 --> 00:40.171
Everett Besh was so good, you know, he had a memory 
that he graduated with honors. And I had heard that

00:41.413 --> 00:53.628
when he graduated he went to some university as 
head of some department because of his ability.

00:54.650 --> 01:01.999
And Wallace Larson, he was from San Antonio, he 
opened up his place.

01:02.671 --> 01:05.154
He did pretty well with the ranchers. And Louis 
Springer,

01:06.135 --> 01:15.286
his mother had to come down and be close to her son. 
We used to laugh because when Louis Springer's

01:17.128 --> 01:25.438
wife and my wife got together,

01:27.072 --> 01:31.317
they were going to go to Bryan, to Safeways or 
Atlantic Pacific. And this little old lady, she

01:32.899 --> 01:37.786
looked out the window, where are you going? Oh 
we're going to get some whatever. All right, wait

01:42.191 --> 01:44.013
just a minute, I'm going with you. And my wife was 
looking and we couldn't tell her no, so here she

01:44.814 --> 01:50.802
comes. So we remember that lady because of that. 
Well, she had no friends, you know, and she didn't

01:54.216 --> 01:59.662
want to be alone all the time. All right, so that 
first year, your wife then stayed home and took

02:00.443 --> 02:08.992
care of your five-year-old. Yes, because of the 
unavailability of housing. And there wasn't

02:14.678 --> 02:16.320
kindergarten. No, no, I'm talking about when you 
all got here. in Vet Village. She didn't have a

02:19.981 --> 02:22.725
full-time job. No, he did not have a full-time job. 
And so she took care of him. Did you have a nickname

02:28.432 --> 02:30.255
by that time? Yeah. They called me Quate. Quate? 
Yeah. Q-U-A-T? Oh, you could say C-U-A-T-E.

02:44.593 --> 02:44.714
Right. What does that mean? That means close 
friend. Oh, Quate, Quate. Did almost all of the

02:49.237 --> 02:52.061
veterans have nicknames? Well, no. Not that I 
recall. Some of those veterans were,

02:59.430 --> 03:07.441
what's the word I want to use?

03:10.965 --> 03:19.176
They would see these young freshmen and they 
wanted nothing to do with them. They didn't

03:19.628 --> 03:21.010
believe in it. They said, we've been out there, 
we've risked our lives all these years during the

03:21.030 --> 03:31.506
war for you guys, and for me to take a lot of bluffs 
from you guys? No. And they would not associate

03:32.547 --> 03:37.755
with them. I didn't feel that way. I said, hey, I 
need them. And so we got along fine. All right.

03:46.031 --> 03:52.600
After you moved then into College View, did you and 
your wife attend the college functions? Did you

03:53.221 --> 03:55.464
all go to events on the campus then? Not, no. Didn't 
go to Guy and Hall movies? Oh, yeah. We went to the

04:00.772 --> 04:02.975
movies, yes. How did you get that job at Guy and 
Hall? Well, I had a friend named Stotzenberg, and

04:07.520 --> 04:20.896
his sister was married to a chemistry major. And 
the girl, his sister, worked at Gine Hall at the box

04:23.198 --> 04:29.926
office. She sold the tickets.

04:37.810 --> 04:45.539
He had some, he had some tickets, and he says, I'm 
going to guide. I got a new ticket, you want to come

04:46.039 --> 04:47.361
along? Yeah, I'll come along. And I heard 
something, you know, looking in my head. He said, I

04:56.491 --> 04:59.975
want to talk to the manager of that place or 
something. I want to get my foot in the door. So I

05:02.297 --> 05:02.798
went. Fair enough. I met Mr. Tom Putty. Tom Putty 
was a real slim fella. He had three daughters and a

05:09.880 --> 05:11.602
wife. And his three daughters finally married 
Aggies. Now Tom Putty was the manager of Garn Hall

05:17.711 --> 05:27.704
and he did the sign writing for the movies that were 
coming. He was good at it with the watercolor.

05:33.616 --> 05:39.782
He had six cents, if you want to call that, of how 
many fixed cameras. I mean, he could fix cameras,

05:41.463 --> 05:55.176
and almost every day the mailman would deliver a 
package of a camera that was defective from some

05:41.463 --> 05:55.176
guy somewhere away, you know. And he'd say, fix it, 
and I'd tell him to send me the bill. He took

06:04.598 --> 06:11.145
pictures of the ring dance and worked all night in 
the basement. One day I went into the basement and

06:11.165 --> 06:14.548
it was dark and I fell down a hole. Yes. And I didn't 
get hurt. My boy would just scare the fool out of me.

06:21.655 --> 06:34.048
And then I noticed one time there was some elderly 
men and they turned on the lights and they had a

06:21.655 --> 06:34.048
table like this one. little locomotive trains, 
you know. Toy train. Yeah. And it was elaborate. I

06:42.068 --> 06:43.650
said, my God. Well, that's a hobby with them, you 
know. So I got to meet Mr. Putty. And we talked. He

06:52.021 --> 06:52.742
was real nice. He said, Mr. Putty, I need a job, a 
part-time job. And what did I do? get a job here,

07:00.995 --> 07:03.678
doing something, anything. He said, well look, I 
got all the help I need. You come see me next

07:10.966 --> 07:13.128
semester.

07:15.911 --> 07:17.773
This was in April.

07:21.217 --> 07:22.618
So I gave my name and everything. So one of the 
cadets, a senior, had to go to summer camp. Not in

07:28.064 --> 07:30.006
May, but in April. He was a projectionist. So, lo 
and behold, when this cadet had to leave, Mr. Putty

07:34.168 --> 07:40.255
sent word for me.

07:43.799 --> 07:44.760
Was that every night? No, no. That you were to work 
over there? Yeah, I was to work over there, I think

07:47.343 --> 07:52.770
it was two afternoons a week. So he showed me how to 
thread and join him. And so I got by in the month of

08:00.173 --> 08:05.078
May. Then of course, you know, summer, they closed 
it. So from then on, I had a regular part-time job.

08:14.329 --> 08:16.932
Do you remember what the pay was for that part-time 
job? Yes, 50 cents a week. I mean, 50 cents an hour,

08:19.155 --> 08:21.798
I'm sorry. An hour, 50 cents an hour. And it was up on 
the second stoop. Well, I say second stoop because

08:26.305 --> 08:28.167
it was high. And it only had two windows about this 
wide. And the fumes from the ark were getting to me.

08:41.042 --> 08:43.465
So I said, hey, I've got to get out of here. And he put 
me somewhere else. He said, oh, you take the

08:47.410 --> 08:52.035
popcorn concession. candy, popcorn, this kind of 
thing. And I said, hey, that's fine. And then, at

08:57.891 --> 09:09.505
night, I would go to three places to put up my 
billboards for the movies the next day. And so, all

09:09.866 --> 09:16.774
in total, getting ready to graduate, I was not 
earning 80 cents an hour. That was big money then,

09:24.029 --> 09:25.670
too. And there was no tax withholding, nothing 
like that then. Oh, brother, it was something. And

09:32.799 --> 09:41.869
during the, when they were building the bonfire 
and logs, you know, I would be challenged, you

09:32.799 --> 09:41.869
know, when I'd go out at night to put up my 
billboards. And I had to show the secretary who I

09:42.449 --> 09:46.474
was, where I am. because they didn't want nothing 
to happen to that fall fire. But they did. One

09:56.711 --> 09:59.695
evening this plane came over. You remember that? 
No, but I've heard about it. Describe it. The way it

10:06.604 --> 10:10.909
got to be, see, this plane came over, it was a light 
plane. And they had one of those score cans, five

10:11.800 --> 10:17.927
gallon, with gasoline and a wick. And this plane 
was supposed to come low, light the wick, and let

10:19.649 --> 10:27.078
this can hit the following, set it on fire. What 
these two guys in this plane didn't know, that it

10:28.359 --> 10:38.811
takes about 30,000 gallons of naphtha to set this 
pile of raw material. Well, anyway, it flew low. It

10:40.758 --> 10:44.464
dropped its can with the wig, but it missed the 
logs. I don't know how far it was. And that was the

10:46.286 --> 10:50.312
talk of the day the next day, you know. And that was 
something. Now, during those years in College

10:52.696 --> 10:59.426
View, what was your normal daily routine? What 
time did you get up? What chores did you do at the

11:01.068 --> 11:03.993
apartment? And what did you do all day? Well, trash 
started at noon o'clock. And I had to get up at about

11:10.390 --> 11:26.015
6 o'clock in the morning, get everything ready, 
and go back on campus. We were having classes in

11:26.035 --> 11:36.212
what they called, well, there's different 
places. And I had a tag on my car, so I had a certain

11:36.766 --> 11:44.193
place where I could park. The KKs were just 
everywhere. And if you got, I think it was three

11:47.756 --> 11:55.323
tickets, and you couldn't explain why, then you 
were barred. You couldn't drive your car in. You

11:57.425 --> 12:00.508
walked, or somebody else gave you a ride. Okay, so 
I'm going to go to classes. If the next class didn't

12:05.150 --> 12:15.244
start for another hour, I was hit for the library or 
someplace where I could read up and be prepared.

12:16.405 --> 12:27.581
And so then the classes were over by noon, and so I 
did go back to the house. And if I had an afternoon

12:28.041 --> 12:30.545
class, well, I had to come back. Otherwise, I'd 
stay. there where we were staying. And study all

12:37.305 --> 12:38.366
afternoon? Study all afternoon, unless I had a 
part-time job somewhere where it was study,

12:38.386 --> 12:44.955
study, study. Now, did the GI Bill and what you were 
able to earn while you were here, did it pay for

12:45.736 --> 12:52.505
everything? Yes. Yeah, I had a ticket, and that was 
to buy supplies, you know, notebooks, pencils.

13:05.360 --> 13:20.300
I'd just get what I needed, and then the clerk at the 
bookstore, they had a punch, you know, and they'd

13:05.360 --> 13:20.300
say, well, you got a dollar and a half worth of 
stuff. And then when the, when that card was all,

13:20.320 --> 13:29.232
put a hold, you know, no more, that was it, no more. 
Somebody figured out how much supplies you would

13:31.055 --> 13:35.080
need, see. Now how did you become acquainted with 
A&M traditions and ceremonies and all the routine

13:35.887 --> 13:47.142
at A&M? There wasn't any orientation for you 
veterans, was there? No. Not one orientation. Do

13:54.932 --> 13:58.156
you remember going to your first silver taps? I 
didn't go to silver taps. You didn't go to Silver

14:03.342 --> 14:06.045
Taps while you were an undergraduate, ever? No. 
Oh, yes. I went when we were at the annex. Yeah, but

14:09.850 --> 14:11.792
once you came to the campus. Oh, yes. What was your 
impression when you went to Silver Taps? Well, I

14:15.978 --> 14:31.797
could understand that there was a feeling, and 
that was fear of binding

14:15.978 --> 14:31.797
with the present students. And the old students, 
there was a spirit of cohesion, if you will, that

14:32.047 --> 14:40.456
you just couldn't forget about it. And this is what 
the class did last year here for us. Now it's up to us

14:46.902 --> 14:49.985
to do it and keep up the tradition. And I had heard 
through my in-laws that, hey, there's Aggies all

14:51.407 --> 14:58.094
over the world. I says, you can go someplace. And 
you meet up with an Aggie, and five minutes later,

15:01.915 --> 15:07.962
hey, you're old friends. And you don't see that 
with Baylor or Texas Tech or those others. And this

15:13.208 --> 15:15.710
is a friendship that's everlasting. And so when 
y'all were living in College View, you brought

15:16.551 --> 15:23.839
your wife and your little boy, and you went to 
Silver Taps. Did y'all go to midnight yell

15:24.540 --> 15:28.024
practice? Maybe once or twice. Did you help work on 
Bonfire ever? Work on Bonfire? No, no. That was

15:39.250 --> 15:41.732
strictly for the Corps of Cadets. I'm sure that, 
well that's all I saw. And I don't think that ever

15:46.898 --> 15:50.762
would have turned me down, you know. But I said, 
well they've got enough help. And I see all those

15:54.226 --> 15:57.690
cranes and everything out there. So I never 
volunteered, I just said. You older veterans, did

16:02.311 --> 16:17.324
sometimes the younger undergraduates kind of 
look at you with envy or give you a hard, did they

16:02.311 --> 16:17.324
ever seem jealous that y'all were so much older and 
so much more mature? There were times like that,

16:17.344 --> 16:22.008
yes. They didn't come out and say so, but I could 
sense it, you know. They couldn't get used to

16:28.906 --> 16:42.582
having older

16:28.906 --> 16:42.582
students there when they were used to seeing the 
younger ones together. They were a little miles

16:43.043 --> 16:46.467
apart. As you began to understand A&M, Describe 
the way people were treated as students by other

16:55.484 --> 17:01.252
students. Did it matter who your parents were, 
where you came from, what your background was? No,

17:07.060 --> 17:07.481
sir.

17:10.385 --> 17:12.989
It seemed like all the barriers just dropped. 
Everybody was an Aggie. There was never a bad

17:16.694 --> 17:18.116
Aggie. All Aggies are good. And once a year, See, 
Bolton at one time, when we were freshmen, Bolton

17:25.707 --> 17:41.228
told us, all of us, the veterans, he says, if you 
don't learn anything, you learn how to meet

17:25.707 --> 17:41.228
people. And it's true to this day. And I watched 
those

17:43.871 --> 17:54.465
juniors and seniors when they go up there and they 
shake hands, see? And I couldn't understand. I

17:55.816 --> 17:58.258
said, why did they go like this? My name's Jerk. He 
said, well, when they go up to a freshman, Harley

18:01.001 --> 18:07.507
Fitz Jones, and he hits a brace. And you're trying 
to grab him and get him off balance. Oh, that's it.

18:13.372 --> 18:15.714
And to this day, I still do that. And sometimes when 
I meet one for the first time, an Aggie, I knew you

18:16.795 --> 18:24.722
were an Aggie. the way you shook hands. And

18:27.388 --> 18:34.035
the fact that you were Hispanic never was any 
disadvantage? No.

18:38.059 --> 18:45.247
I think no, there was no disadvantage really. At 
the time I was there, there were very few

18:47.469 --> 18:54.456
Hispanics. Aside from those that came from Mexico 
or Uruguay, that was a different breed. And the

19:05.342 --> 19:20.545
ones that were from the state of Texas or someplace 
else, they were, seemed to be down here for

19:05.342 --> 19:20.545
business, to get that education, and there was no 
animosities or any, you know. Now, what did you and

19:23.656 --> 19:29.524
your wife and your youngster do for relaxation? 
What did you all do for enjoyment?

19:34.310 --> 19:47.747
Well, I didn't, my wife made friends with the other 
wives, and my little boy had to play with the other

19:34.310 --> 19:47.747
kids.

19:49.212 --> 19:51.536
I tell you, it was heartbreaking for me. When we 
came over to that village, he had an old bicycle,

19:52.577 --> 20:00.229
and one of the wheels had lost a rubber tire. And the 
other kids, they had some nice tricycles. So we

20:06.118 --> 20:15.793
went down to Bryan, Westonado, and they had toys.

20:16.870 --> 20:29.781
a little bicycle with a chain on it that I wanted to 
get for Robert so he wouldn't feel isolated from

20:16.870 --> 20:29.781
the others because he had a junk tricycle. So the 
manager was named Mr. Daniels. And I didn't take

20:36.487 --> 20:39.069
offense to what he said. He

20:39.209 --> 20:46.135
let me open an account and I would pay him I think it 
was $5 a month. And a bicycle cost, I think it was $25

20:49.627 --> 20:52.772
or $27.50.

20:54.915 --> 20:59.441
And he says, you will pay me, won't you? I said, yes, 
sir. He said, I'll pay my bills. It's OK. So I

21:04.748 --> 21:07.992
figured, he thought I was going to skip town. So I 
did. I paid it. Paid it in full. That was the only

21:12.939 --> 21:15.683
time, see. I said, no, he wasn't being antisocial. 
He must have been suffering some losses from

21:21.361 --> 21:30.109
people that are coming to A&M, and they flunk, and 
they leave, and then he's holding sacks. Other

21:30.529 --> 21:32.371
than that, no. And my wife could make friends 
anywhere she could go. And so it was okay then. All

21:42.539 --> 21:42.960
right. At the end of that first year at College 
View, Did you all go back to San Antonio that next

21:46.240 --> 21:48.863
summer? I think we did.

21:54.310 --> 21:58.795
Well, one summer I stayed and worked at the Grove. 
At the Grove? At the Grove, yeah. And Mr. Putty was

22:01.859 --> 22:09.008
the one that showed the movies, and I had the 
concession for the popcorn and peanuts. Ten cents

22:09.528 --> 22:16.359
a bag, and I'll never forget that, because when I 
turned in the money, it was all dimes.

22:17.722 --> 22:19.004
Everybody had a dime. Oh, I tell you, it was 
something.

22:24.433 --> 22:28.900
Let's see, I'm trying to think of... This says that 
in the summer of 51, you went back to San Antonio,

22:33.980 --> 22:38.724
and then came back that fall in the new part of 
College View. Yes, sir. What kind of automobile

22:41.747 --> 22:43.629
did you have by then? It was a 1940

22:43.649 --> 22:49.154
Chevrolet.

22:52.537 --> 22:53.458
It was a two-door. Once

22:55.280 --> 23:03.227
or twice, my son was going to A&M Consolidated 
Elementary School. And the school had a bus. They

23:10.961 --> 23:13.865
would come by and pick up the kids, see? Well, my son 
wanted to get on the bus, so we'd give him his nickel

23:13.885 --> 23:20.394
to get on the bus. And this morning, he missed it. 
Oh, he felt bad. Daddy, I don't want to get on the

23:26.482 --> 23:28.245
bus. So I said, all right, get in the car. So we 
followed the bus, and we passed the bus by two

23:31.642 --> 23:37.147
blocks, and I let him off. Then the bus had to stop 
and pick him off over there. I guess the driver was

23:41.611 --> 23:44.994
the one that said, well, this kid's over here. He 
belongs in College Field. He paid his nickel. But,

23:48.177 --> 23:52.481
see, he had his little friends on that bus, too, 
see. And as far as you know, his experiences at A&M

23:52.982 --> 23:57.386
Consolidated were all positive? Oh, yes. And I 
said, oh. I remember when we were at College View,

24:01.612 --> 24:10.600
when the band left their area to go practice on Kyle 
Field, they'd play. And man, all those kids would

24:11.641 --> 24:18.888
come out of the house and look at the band and follow 
the band. There was something about the band that

24:19.849 --> 24:29.678
just, you know, makes... Did you and your wife and 
your son go to Bonfire? Yes. And what was your

24:31.542 --> 24:33.504
impression of Bonfire then? Well, at first, I got a 
thrill out of it.

24:41.212 --> 24:44.555
Like a fool, we wanted to get up there close. And 
when that thing lit, boy, we had a retreat. After

24:49.199 --> 24:55.185
that, you know, it was, you know, second nature, 
was it? But the young people, they loved it.

24:57.822 --> 25:00.926
Because they had the girlfriends, you know, and 
all this. And to them, well, it was a chance to be

25:00.946 --> 25:04.310
with a girl and all this. And they just loved that. 
That was an excuse to get out and have some fun. Old

25:12.099 --> 25:15.343
guys like me, Barrett says, well, the first one, 
that's okay. That's just like eating apples.

25:17.265 --> 25:20.189
After you eat the third one, it doesn't taste as 
good as the first one. Now, Bonfire was held on the

25:20.629 --> 25:23.813
drill field then? In front of where the MSC is now? 
No. Not on the drill field. It wasn't held on the

25:30.939 --> 25:32.782
drill field? No. Oh, here. Behind where Duncan is? 
Yeah. Okay. Yes, sir. Okay. Because for a few years

25:39.051 --> 25:43.859
it was on the drill field, and I didn't know when it 
moved. Let's see. Did you all go to yell practice,

25:46.523 --> 25:52.753
midnight yell practice? I don't recall. Did you go 
to football games? Oh, yes. What was it like for an

25:58.810 --> 26:02.654
older veteran and his wife to go to a football game?

26:06.117 --> 26:08.380
Well, give me that again. No, I was saying what was 
it like for you as an older student? You know, you

26:13.024 --> 26:15.287
weren't an 18- or 19-year-old. You were mature. 
Well,

26:16.848 --> 26:22.234
to be truthful, I had never seen a college football 
game. And this was the thrill, see. And over there,

26:27.165 --> 26:34.394
the last row, there was like a wall. And I'd take my 
son, and I'd sit him up there. I thought I had to hold

26:38.558 --> 26:40.721
him. And I remember one fellow, he was selling 
Coca-Cola. In those days, it was in a bottle. And

26:52.150 --> 26:55.535
they were just semi-cold. You had to have 
something to drink. And he had these cases, wooden

26:58.520 --> 27:03.408
cases of Coca-Cola. And he was selling this by the 
bottle. I forget what the cost. And someone said,

27:10.359 --> 27:13.204
you see that fellow over there? He's selling 
coats, you know? And he's working his way to a

27:15.647 --> 27:17.410
college. I said, you mean? Whatever he makes, 
that's what he has to pay. Boy, he must sell a lot of

27:22.560 --> 27:26.065
coats. Yes. And let's see, your practice, what 
about the Aggie band? How did that impress you? Oh,

27:37.698 --> 27:41.342
I tell you, it gets that big goose pimples in my arm.

27:44.446 --> 27:47.790
Did you all go to any out-of-town football games? 
You and your wife? I don't recall. No, sir. Let's

27:53.275 --> 27:53.615
see. Did you join a church here? Yes. Where? We went 
to the First Baptist Church in College Station. In

28:03.084 --> 28:06.407
College Station, not in Bryan? No, we visited over 
there in Bryan. But here? But here, with Brother

28:09.330 --> 28:11.372
Longshore. Remember Longshore? Okay. And what 
led you to that particular church? I think Rachel

28:19.630 --> 28:30.283
had some friend that suggested it, and then it was 
closer to go here than to go on the way to Bryan. And

28:31.044 --> 28:37.051
the people, we didn't know nobody in Bryan, but we 
knew some people over here. In fact, we knew some of

28:37.071 --> 28:40.916
the ushers. One of them had a cleaning place over 
here on South Gate. I can't remember his name. And

28:49.767 --> 28:56.515
so it was more of a friendly atmosphere, whether 
you like it or not. So we stayed, we stayed for

28:57.256 --> 29:02.982
preaching, and it was, we enjoyed it. And Mrs. 
Marion Pugh, she taught the little ones, and my son

29:03.523 --> 29:13.735
was there. He would use some of the terms. And in the 
morning time, we still kid him about that. And

29:24.490 --> 29:27.152
Varian Pugh was in my class. Do you remember Flake 
Fisher? Okay, Flake Fisher was in my Sunday School

29:31.076 --> 29:33.599
class also.

29:36.602 --> 29:41.267
Let's see, the MSC was being built during this 
time? Yeah, it was just being built. As a memorial

29:42.908 --> 29:47.614
to the World War II veterans, yes, sir. But Guyon 
Hall was still the big place for the important

29:47.634 --> 29:51.398
events. Oh, yeah. Do you remember any important 
celebrity visitors that came while you were a

29:52.700 --> 29:58.687
student? Well, yeah, there was a... Did 
Eisenhower come during that? Oh, yeah,

30:04.595 --> 30:05.996
Eisenhower was here. He visited here. And...

30:12.085 --> 30:25.229
there was a dance or something, and a named band, 
they would give a concert at Guyon, see, for those

30:12.085 --> 30:25.229
people that didn't want to, they were not going to 
attend the other function. And this band, there

30:26.130 --> 30:33.003
was Glenn Gray, his Casa Loma Orchestra, he was 
here. And Glenn Gray met I said, Rachel's sister.

30:40.208 --> 30:41.049
And he liked her. And he says, say, do you sing? I 
need a singer. And God I just, who asked you that?

30:49.761 --> 30:50.983
Glenn Gray. And then there was Billy something, he 
had a band. I don't recall their last name. And they

31:00.016 --> 31:05.143
had left the instruments there on the stage in the 
afternoon. And some kid took a trumpet and he was

31:05.444 --> 31:13.958
going to blow it and he took it home somewhere and 
the K.K.' 's were looking for that kid and they knew

31:13.938 --> 31:16.542
who it was, see? Billy, Billy something. Okay. And 
then who else? There was another band that came

31:22.672 --> 31:24.795
down. Did the Dorseys? No. I don't remember that 
one.
