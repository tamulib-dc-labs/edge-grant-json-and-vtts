Last question. What feelings do you hold in your 
heart for A&M now? Well, I feel, first, I feel very

00:11.441 --> 00:19.833
gratified. I feel that I was very fortunate. I was 
available at a time when I had qualifications that

00:25.441 --> 00:33.312
could make a contribution.

00:37.544 --> 00:52.197
that's difficult to defeat and I feel comfortable 
about my career. I feel like A&M is standing up in a

00:52.617 --> 01:06.690
tremendous growth period with a great deal of 
productivity, a great deal of I think

01:07.396 --> 01:20.209
that Malem Sutherland has done an excellent job of 
folding all of these things together. I think the

01:21.230 --> 01:34.483
Corps has done a good job of establishing itself 
without being too pushy.

01:34.750 --> 01:50.522
But most of all, though, I feel so grateful that the 
young people that I'm around show the same

01:34.750 --> 01:50.522
characteristics as they did 60 years ago. That's 
good on them. Thank you.
