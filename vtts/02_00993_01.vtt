00:01.702 --> 00:07.790
You can't get the pictures on

00:01.702 --> 00:07.790
the tape. This is an interview with Geraldine Ann 
Johnson, maiden name Hart, by Tracy L. Swope on 4

00:07.810 --> 00:16.501
December in Temple concerning the Vietnam War. In 
the interest of accumulating knowledge about the

00:17.302 --> 00:24.872
war, I'm going to donate this tape to the Texas A&M 
Oral History Collection and the University

00:17.302 --> 00:24.872
Archives. Is this all right with you? Yes, this is 
all right with me.

00:32.313 --> 00:38.603
My first question is, can you please give us some 
background on your life, and why did you join the

00:32.313 --> 00:38.603
service? I'm the eldest of eight children of a 
Marine Corps officer for 29 years, and I grew up at

00:40.045 --> 00:55.188
places like El Toro and Cherry Point, and I 
graduated from high school in 1961. My father was

00:55.549 --> 00:58.253
the kind of person that people were in those days 
and as far as he was concerned as an Irish Catholic I

00:59.110 --> 01:26.417
had three possible futures as the eldest of eight 
children and a daughter I could go into the convent

00:59.110 --> 01:26.417
I could become a teacher or I could become a nurse at 
the time I had some degree of flair for languages

00:59.110 --> 01:26.417
and I had studied two languages in high school and 
was very taken with the glamour and romance of the

00:59.110 --> 01:26.417
Foreign Service and had been accepted to the 
Georgetown School of Foreign Affairs and, of

01:26.498 --> 01:31.687
course, had no money to go. And nobody was giving 
scholarship money to 16-year-old girls in those

01:31.727 --> 01:35.653
days. I had not turned 17 when I graduated. So a 
friend of mine who had always wanted to be a nurse

01:39.339 --> 01:50.157
all her life, her dad was a Navy captain, was going 
to go to Georgetown University to a nursing

01:39.339 --> 01:50.157
school. And she had the catalog. And lo and behold, 
it said that if you were a registered nurse and

01:52.199 --> 01:58.667
worked in our hospital, you got six free semester 
hours a semester. Well, I allowed it to happen. As

02:00.308 --> 02:09.579
young as I was, I could piss away three years in a 
nursing school somewhere and become an RN and then

02:00.308 --> 02:09.579
go to Georgetown and work my way through the School 
of Foreign Affairs. So that was my plan. And I went

02:12.583 --> 02:20.552
off to Maryview Hospital in Portsmouth, 
Virginia, which ran a diploma school of nursing,

02:12.583 --> 02:20.552
to embark on this plan.

02:21.562 --> 02:32.437
It was during that period of time, from 62 through 
65, that all the events that kicked Vietnam loose

02:21.562 --> 02:32.437
as a war for our country transpired. I vividly 
remember being a student nursing, coming back to

02:33.018 --> 02:46.257
the dormitory on the break, and the television was 
on, and President Johnson was talking about the

02:33.018 --> 02:46.257
Tonkin Bay, or Gulf incident, and when they had 
fired on our ships. Well, about midway through my

02:47.779 --> 02:50.843
junior year, I got interested in the scholarship 
plans. And at that point in time, the Navy Nurse

02:56.095 --> 03:00.782
Corps was only taking students from college 
programs. And the Army and the Air Force were

03:01.663 --> 03:06.871
taking students from both college and diploma 
programs. And so I had focused in on the Air Force

03:07.712 --> 03:10.797
and the Army. And to be quite honest, the Army 
recruiter was doing his job. He was personable. He

03:15.084 --> 03:15.725
was interested. He followed up on us. and he just 
pursued us hotly there were about six of us in my

03:18.565 --> 03:48.117
class that he was convinced would be wonderful 
nurse corps officers as a matter of fact he

03:18.565 --> 03:48.117
succeeded in recruiting four of us and we signed up 
for the army student nurse program which in those

03:18.565 --> 03:48.117
days they swore you in as a pfc in the women's army 
reserve and you were on active duty as a student

03:18.565 --> 03:48.117
nurse you made 99.37 a month now until that time my 
father had dutifully sent me a 25 check every month

03:18.565 --> 03:48.117
as my allowance and I bought everything I needed 
with $25 a month that wasn't provided by my school,

03:48.721 --> 03:58.852
which was room, board, uniforms, books, pretty 
much everything provided. But I mean, soap

03:59.332 --> 04:06.740
powder, makeup, all that stuff, I was on a $25 a 
month allowance, and I thought I had got rich.

04:06.760 --> 04:13.868
$99.37 a month was just, you know, your major 
increase in status. And so my senior year was quite

04:14.202 --> 04:17.146
comfy. I just did anything I felt like doing. I 
guess I had lived on a beer budget so long that I

04:20.131 --> 04:28.544
didn't really have much taste for champagne, and I 
just had a marvelous time. And indeed, when I

04:29.705 --> 04:34.252
graduated, I was committed to join the Army Nurse 
Corps for two years. In fact, I was in the Army. If I

04:37.277 --> 04:40.041
didn't pass state boards, I was going to get to be an 
enlisted medic. And of course, in those days,

04:40.544 --> 04:43.468
people passed state boards. There wasn't any if to 
it. The schools taught to the boys. But anyway, I

04:48.073 --> 04:54.621
was put out on leave to entertain myself until my 
state board results came back. And I went to work at

04:54.681 --> 04:57.164
George Washington University Hospital. Dad had 
three consecutive tours that they lived in the

04:57.685 --> 05:01.530
same house for. He was at the Navy Annex, and then he 
was at Henderson. No, then he was at the Chief of

05:05.875 --> 05:10.180
Naval Operations Office, and then he was at 
Henderson Hall. and so they were three PCS tours

05:10.987 --> 05:28.665
but they lived in the same house six blocks from 
Fort Myer North Gate in Arlington, Virginia

05:10.987 --> 05:28.665
during that whole period of time that I was going 
through nurses training and for many years

05:10.987 --> 05:28.665
thereafter it was a nine-year stint there. 
Consequently my four youngest sisters and

05:30.167 --> 05:35.492
brothers grew up in that house and have a totally 
different idea of what life is like than the four

05:36.839 --> 05:41.546
older of us who grew up moving around on air bases. 
Anyway, my state boards came through and in

05:42.728 --> 06:01.075
sometime in the middle of August in 65 I reported to 
Fort Sam Houston, Texas where I went through basic

05:42.728 --> 06:01.075
at the medical field service school and for a 
little girl who was 19 who had just been in a convent

06:01.342 --> 06:25.290
school of nursing for three years it was really 
quite quite an experience not exactly

06:01.342 --> 06:25.290
academically challenging and I had just never 
seen so much steak beer and cute guys in my life and I

06:01.342 --> 06:25.290
had a wonderful time and it's a good thing it didn't 
last longer than nine weeks because I don't think

06:01.342 --> 06:25.290
my metabolism could have kept up and At that point 
in time it was, you know, full bore. They ran the

06:29.181 --> 06:42.296
school where they had so many companies of doctors 
and a company of medical service corps officers

06:29.181 --> 06:42.296
and two companies of nurses and, you know, that 
kind of thing. We were all there for nine weeks at

06:42.316 --> 06:50.525
the same time and then every nine weeks they just 
turned it over and cleared the barracks out and ran

06:42.316 --> 06:50.525
in another bunch. And everybody had orders to stay 
inside places. And everybody knew that within a

06:55.730 --> 07:00.616
year, they were probably going to start rotating 
overseas one place or another. At the time, I had

07:01.357 --> 07:08.465
put on my dream sheet that I wanted to go to Nancy, 
France, which was the last US Army hospital in

07:01.357 --> 07:08.465
France. But it was during my senior year, after I 
turned in my dream sheet, that France quit NATO and

07:08.966 --> 07:18.177
they closed that hospital. So I wasn't going to 
France. But most of my friends were angling to go to

07:21.081 --> 07:24.825
Europe one way or another. I got stamped with 50 of 
my classmates to Walter Reed in Washington, D.C.,

07:25.987 --> 07:31.854
right back where I came from. Never been so damn 
disgusted in my life. And what had happened is that

07:37.080 --> 07:47.352
they had mobilized one of the, I forget what they 
called them in those days, Strack Unit hospitals,

07:37.080 --> 07:47.352
you know what they called them? And it was a 
warehouse ghost hospital nothing but supplies

07:53.257 --> 08:19.602
and a couple of sergeants to count them and they had 
stripped all the big hospitals in the states of

07:53.257 --> 08:19.602
active duty personnel to staff this thing and had 
shipped it over to Vietnam and they shipped 50 of us

07:53.257 --> 08:19.602
into Walter Reed all on the same reporting day to 
replace these people and we were put on duty that

07:53.257 --> 08:19.602
day and Walter Reed at that point in time had been 
running without these people for about two weeks

08:20.442 --> 08:23.365
Everybody was on six-day weeks, and they were on 
12-hour days. And I worked on 12-hour days and

08:24.526 --> 08:32.453
six-day weeks for the three months that I was at 
good old Walter Reed. We suddenly realized that

08:32.473 --> 08:38.899
the 50 of us they had sent there were all nurses, and 
three of the nurses were guys. And we were now back

08:39.600 --> 08:44.425
where everybody was married, majors, and 
colonels. And it was really very unsociable, and

08:44.485 --> 08:47.047
it was very expensive. And lieutenants in 
Washington, DC just it's not a survival mode and I

08:50.125 --> 09:14.985
was bleeding on my father's shoulder about how I 
certainly did not join the army to putter my time

08:50.125 --> 09:14.985
away at Walter Reed for heaven's sakes it was just 
awful and he said well honey what you need to do is

08:50.125 --> 09:14.985
you need to put on your greens make an appointment 
make an appointment that's important to see the

08:50.125 --> 09:14.985
chief nurse march in report to her desk and request 
orders for Vietnam I said, okay, so I went back and I

09:16.552 --> 09:27.765
called the nice sergeant who was her desk 
personage and told him that I wanted an

09:16.552 --> 09:27.765
appointment with Colonel Barrett and I still 
remember her name. And he gave me one at 8 o'clock on

09:27.786 --> 09:42.323
Monday morning the following Monday and I put my 
greens on and marched smartly into her office and

09:27.786 --> 09:42.323
snapped two in front of her desk and Lieutenant 
Hart reporting, ma'am, and I would like to request

09:27.786 --> 09:42.323
reassignment to Vietnam. and she looked at me and 
she said you're not ready to go to Vietnam

09:43.113 --> 10:10.588
lieutenant because you can't even get your 
uniform on right you don't have your bars on yes

09:43.113 --> 10:10.588
ma'am I'll fix that so I went back and I called my dad 
in tears and he said honey yeah you live and learn

09:43.113 --> 10:10.588
she said call back and make an appointment for next 
Monday at eight o'clock I had five consecutive

09:43.113 --> 10:10.588
Monday morning eight o'clock appointments with 
Colonel Barrett And each time it got to be a game,

10:11.125 --> 10:14.188
okay, Lieutenant, you've been here. Thank you, 
ma'am. Dismissed. Out the other face, and out I go.

10:19.754 --> 10:21.596
Every morning. The ward I was on was Ward 36, and it 
was 40 beds, and six of them up front were what are

10:22.678 --> 10:32.448
now ICU beds. They were mainly the close to the 
nurse's station beds in those days. And all but

10:36.152 --> 10:40.677
five of the patients on that ward, and it was full 
all the time. had come from the Yodrang Valley

10:41.534 --> 10:44.797
Battle, and they were all from the 1st Air Cav. And 
average age, discounting the other five

10:45.578 --> 10:52.485
patients, was probably all of 23 or 24. And they 
all, it was a general surgery and plastic surgery

10:53.386 --> 10:56.389
floor. So I had a lot of the guys with avulsion 
wounds who were awaiting granulation healing so

10:56.429 --> 11:04.017
that they could go in for complex plastic surgery 
techniques. And had one kid, Sergeant Starr, who

11:04.037 --> 11:10.123
had been shot in the canteen. And if you think about 
physics and metal canteens, what happens when you

11:11.251 --> 11:19.481
have a fluid under pressure? That canteen 
exploded like a grenade and blew half his hip off.

11:24.647 --> 11:31.495
Fortunately, it didn't involve any major 
arteries, major veins, major nerves, and it

11:24.647 --> 11:31.495
actually left most of the bone intact. It just blew 
away all the flesh. And so he had this big, great,

11:33.938 --> 11:37.502
massive mess that was healing him. And I vividly 
remember that they decided he was He was good

11:40.613 --> 11:46.742
enough to go home for Christmas on the 24th of 
December, and he came running into the ward

11:40.613 --> 11:46.742
panicky. He had gotten his issue of clothes from 
the quartermaster, and the pants were unhemmed,

11:47.483 --> 11:53.733
and his bus left in an hour and a half. And I sat down 
and hemmed his pants. I mean, what else can you do?

11:59.121 --> 12:07.313
It's hard to tell young student nurses nowadays 
that you could hem somebody's pants and not feel in

11:59.121 --> 12:07.313
the least bit subservient. in today this does not 
not outrage my women's lib blood at all because

12:07.816 --> 12:37.317
that ward was a buddy ship Colonel Barrett 
probably had been harassed by somebody but for

12:07.816 --> 12:37.317
some reason she sent out a big memo to all the wards 
that the televisions were by regulation to be off

12:07.816 --> 12:37.317
at 10 p.m. and we were to enforce that well my guys 
laid in bed all day most of them were in pretty good

12:07.816 --> 12:37.317
condition health-wise except their wounds 
permitted them or prevented them from being just

12:37.887 --> 13:04.097
bored to death and it was a big great hall with 20 
beds down one side and 20 beds down the other and you

12:37.887 --> 13:04.097
know they had the two TVs one at one end of the ward 
one at the other and you know it was about all they

12:37.887 --> 13:04.097
had and the late movies were really pretty 
entertaining so I marched out I was the night nurse

12:37.887 --> 13:04.097
marched out and said gentlemen I make rounds once 
an hour when I make rounds I'm very noisy so you know

13:04.516 --> 13:34.067
I'm coming when I'm making rounds I'm enforcing 
the prohibition about the televisions is that

13:04.516 --> 13:34.067
clear yes ma'am yes ma'am yes ma'am so you know 11 
o'clock I'd slam the door in the medicine cupboard

13:04.516 --> 13:34.067
and clutter around and knock my flashlight on 
something and hear as the TVs went off everybody's

13:04.516 --> 13:34.067
just breathing quietly go back in you hear the TVs 
come right back on you know I never saw television

13:34.891 --> 14:01.793
being on and they took good care of me and I took good 
care of them one day they were it didn't take long

13:34.891 --> 14:01.793
they knew I was the Marine Colonel's daughter and 
they also knew that I had been naive enough to apply

13:34.891 --> 14:01.793
for airborne training while I was in basic and I got 
the news broken to me that the army wasn't really an

13:34.891 --> 14:01.793
equal opportunity employer and that I couldn't go 
to airborne school and So they allowed us how they

14:03.038 --> 14:05.243
were going to teach me themselves. So I crawled up 
on his chair, and they were going to teach me how to

14:05.263 --> 14:14.141
do a parachute landing, and about eight or nine of 
them in their beds coaching me about how I'm

14:05.263 --> 14:14.141
supposed to fall off his chair properly. And this 
little bald man in a white lab coat kind of came

14:14.522 --> 14:22.178
shambling by, and he didn't really say anything, 
but he looked pretty benign, and he kept trying on

14:14.522 --> 14:22.178
going, and You know, I figured if he wanted 
something, he'd have stopped me, and it was the

14:23.137 --> 14:36.699
next day when I saw the picture in front of the 
dining hall that said he was the commander of

14:23.137 --> 14:36.699
Walter Reed Army Medical Center, General 
Mallory, Malloy, Mallory, something like that.

14:36.719 --> 14:41.667
Anyway, we were buddies, and it worked out pretty 
well. Anyway, after my visits, Colonel Barrett

14:42.729 --> 14:49.380
had known Sergeant General Heaton when he was... 
She was a lieutenant nurse and he was a captain

14:50.288 --> 14:53.233
doctor, I think. And she managed to get me shipped 
out ahead of regulations. And I got my orders to

14:58.381 --> 15:07.515
report at Travis Air Force Base in California on 
the, I want to say it was the 4th of January. Anyway,

15:08.717 --> 15:12.803
I took a week's leave and... bummed hops out there. 
It took me about three days to get there. About a

15:17.013 --> 15:19.877
fairly zigzag route, but it didn't cost much. And I 
had a wonderful time. I was a hop bummer. I really

15:23.101 --> 15:24.242
enjoyed that. Just went anywhere I wanted to as 
long as there was an airplane with a seat going

15:24.743 --> 15:28.067
there. And stayed in the Marine Memorial Hotel on 
Sutter Street that my father reckoned I'd be safe

15:29.228 --> 15:35.456
in. And spent two or three days just shopping and 
sleeping late and puttering around and Then met

15:42.213 --> 15:50.285
three of my friends from Basic who also had managed 
to get out of the places they'd been sent to,

15:42.213 --> 15:50.285
wonderful places like Fort Polk, Louisiana. 
Really tells you something when youngsters like

15:51.928 --> 15:59.799
us would rather go to war than be stuck in some of 
these holes. Anyway, one fun thing that happened

16:01.863 --> 16:11.477
that you may appreciate is that while I was 
dragging my duffel bag through the main hall of the

16:01.863 --> 16:11.477
big MAC terminal at Travis, This little airman, 
first class, comes running out, now I'm a

16:11.862 --> 16:19.852
Butterbark lieutenant here, and asked me if he can 
help me with my bag. And I smiled and said, no, I'm

16:19.872 --> 16:22.635
doing fine. Rusty, what are you doing here? It was 
one of our football heroes from when I was in high

16:24.297 --> 16:29.784
school, another Marine colonel's kid. And he was 
very impressed with the fact that I was an officer.

16:38.018 --> 16:42.863
So at any rate, got on the plane and 26 hours later 
got off of it. This has got to be the longest plane

16:42.883 --> 16:47.627
ride I've ever experienced.

16:50.951 --> 16:53.753
Do you feel the Army prepared you to go to Vietnam? 
Did you receive any training? Oh yeah, yeah. In

16:57.377 --> 17:06.726
basic, we had a class advisor who we thought of as 
being as old as Noah's wife, and her name was Major

16:57.377 --> 17:06.726
Betts. and I have found a picture of Major Betts 
around here somewhere. Anyway, here she is. Major

17:15.688 --> 17:19.555
Betts kept throwing in salty reminders. She 
taught all of the etiquette and courtesy and how to

17:19.595 --> 17:27.347
wear your brass and how are things organized and 
arranged and why is AR 670-4 important to you

17:28.019 --> 17:56.541
because it's the AR that covers absolutely 
everything that has to do with running hospitals

17:28.019 --> 17:56.541
and you know she kept throwing in salty references 
to what you should and should not do in combat she

17:28.019 --> 17:56.541
had been a youngster in Korea and had pretty well 
taken it on as her mission to get us sort of used to

17:28.019 --> 17:56.541
the idea that we were going to do this thing and I do 
run into her later in the story now Yeah, did they

17:58.057 --> 18:00.621
prepare us completely? I don't think anybody 
could have. Most of those people, their career

18:02.464 --> 18:08.793
experiences weren't necessarily going to 
duplicate what we were dealing with. They dealt

18:09.274 --> 18:11.917
with a fluid front, but we dealt with no front at 
all. And it made all sorts of things, like can you go

18:11.937 --> 18:18.507
buy something in the village, different. But in 
terms of an expectation of what to take with you and

18:19.609 --> 18:27.220
what was life going to be like, It was reasonably 
well done, if you listened. I had friends who

18:30.803 --> 18:32.225
didn't.

18:35.729 --> 18:36.650
Where did you end up? You relate to us your 
experience of actually landing in Vietnam and

18:37.591 --> 18:42.757
going to your unit. Well, that big plane landed, 
and I had been very uncomfortably asleep with my

18:43.257 --> 18:52.468
head on the shoulder of another nurse, a guy who'd 
been in my basic class, who ended up on the same

18:43.257 --> 18:52.468
flight. It turned out he was going to the same 
hospital, so we kind of linked up. He's a older guy

18:56.309 --> 19:25.573
who was married and had a couple kids and I had a bad 
crick in my neck from trying to sleep like this

18:56.309 --> 19:25.573
because we were packed in I'm sure four abreast in 
those airplanes but it must have been three but

18:56.309 --> 19:25.573
anyway it felt like four anyway uh Dave and I 
stumbled off the thing and you know went over they

18:56.309 --> 19:25.573
were running it pretty much like any other get off a 
big airplane operation went over and got our

18:56.309 --> 19:25.573
luggage and the next thing we know this wiry little 
dried up colonel nurse and an enlisted driver are

18:56.309 --> 19:25.573
standing there going you know, are you 
lieutenants Hart and Ely? And we said, yes,

19:27.776 --> 19:28.797
indeed. And she said, I'm Colonel Coffey, and I've 
come to take you out to the third search. And we're

19:33.923 --> 19:36.666
going to go by the third field and pick up a couple of 
things on our way. So we went over. The third field

19:37.546 --> 19:41.851
hospital was maybe all of six blocks away from 
Thompson Air Base. And so we drove over there in

19:41.871 --> 19:46.516
this cracker box ambulance and went in. And 
somebody gave us a glass of soda, which I was a

19:46.576 --> 19:53.363
little amused, not amused, but bemused at the time 
because it didn't have any ice in it. It was cold. It

19:55.456 --> 19:56.317
didn't have any ice in it. I thought, hmm, strange. 
We didn't have potable ice is what it was. It was ice

20:03.908 --> 20:10.497
with soda caps in it that were supposed to tell you 
not to put it in anything because you couldn't

20:03.908 --> 20:10.497
drink it. You could use it to chill down bottles and 
cans. That's what I learned later. And ever since

20:15.043 --> 20:16.765
then, I've been an ice-a-holic. I fill a glass 
completely up with ice before I put beverage in it

20:16.785 --> 20:23.134
after 18 months with no ice. But anyway, whatever 
business she had to do, she did, and we rode on out

20:23.924 --> 20:39.125
the 30 kilometers or so to the 173rd Space Camp, 
which was where our hospital was, at Bien Hoa,

20:23.924 --> 20:39.125
right off the air base, and chortled in there. And 
she was wringing her hands when she was assigning

20:39.245 --> 20:53.425
us our bunks and telling us that the artillery 
across the street was going to start up their H&Is

20:39.245 --> 20:53.425
about 8 p.m., and she really was sorry because it 
was hard for anybody to sleep. And I rolled into my

20:55.008 --> 20:57.932
bunk, and the next thing I knew, it was noon the next 
day. I slept through the whole thing. That's when I

21:01.276 --> 21:07.223
decided I probably, if they thought that was bad 
stuff and hard to sleep through, that I was

21:01.276 --> 21:07.223
probably going to do okay here. What year was this? 
This was in 1966.

21:13.030 --> 21:14.932
January, by that time, 6th, I think. Something 
like that. Because you had to cross the date line in

21:17.035 --> 21:21.100
the wrong direction to get out there. Anyway, I got 
assigned to the post-op ward. The way the hospital

21:24.217 --> 21:33.269
was organized, it had pre-op, which was our ER 
shock trauma type thing, OR, post-op, and

21:24.217 --> 21:33.269
holding. And to get on holding, you had to be 
ambulatory and have no IVs. Post-op was everybody

21:38.896 --> 21:40.318
else. OR, of course, was OR. And pre-op, at that 
point in time, was an all-male operation, and only

21:42.020 --> 21:48.028
male nurses worked in pre-op. And pre-op did 
everything. They did the immunizations, and they

21:50.695 --> 21:53.558
did blood banking. They drew blood when they 
needed fresh blood. And, of course, when the

21:56.120 --> 22:07.291
choppers landed, they stripped guys and started 
IVs and, you know, worked with getting them ready

21:56.120 --> 22:07.291
for surgery and that kind of thing. And it was 
amazing. In some ways, it was very similar to

22:10.354 --> 22:14.298
standard hospital nursing. In other ways, it was 
very different. The charts only had three kinds of

22:18.102 --> 22:20.044
forms on them. I thought that was wonderful. It had 
doctor's orders, and it had nurse's notes, and it

22:21.387 --> 22:26.514
had a sheet of stable lab slips, too. That's all. 
And if it, you know, that's all there was. I think

22:32.963 --> 22:35.185
there was some merit to that. We really ought to 
take a look at going back to that system. That kind

22:39.892 --> 22:41.233
of thing was real simple. We did some real complex 
surgery. We had the Walter Reed Army Institute of

22:46.901 --> 22:49.204
Research which I will hereafter refer to as rare, 
hemorrhagic shock research team with us. It was

22:55.505 --> 23:05.956
two doctors, both of them were PhD bioengineers as 
well as BMDs, and a nurse, a male nurse, and a couple

22:55.505 --> 23:05.956
of fancy lab tech medic type guys. And patients who 
we had been taught in basic were to be treated as

23:06.817 --> 23:14.444
expectant casualties, give them morphine and 
bring in the chaplain type things. Those guys

23:14.824 --> 23:18.448
worked on and not, not infrequently actually 
packed on aircraft and sent them back home. And it

23:24.548 --> 23:29.273
became the norm in Vietnam surgery that we didn't 
really have expectant categories. I mean, unless

23:29.874 --> 23:38.383
a guy was severed into bitsy pieces, if you still 
had a heart rate and respiration that could be

23:29.874 --> 23:38.383
supported, then we worked on them. We didn't park 
people in the corner, which they had to do in Korea

23:38.744 --> 23:43.309
and Vietnam. I mean, Korea in World War II, a lot.

23:47.605 --> 23:50.229
We did some really kind of heroic stuff. They 
brought in big, great fixed-wing aircraft from

23:52.313 --> 24:04.392
Clark Air Force Base and flew burn casualties in 
one shot with mid-air refueling all the way to

23:52.313 --> 24:04.392
Brook Army Medical Center in Texas from a war zone. 
Of course, we never heard whether these guys lived

24:05.353 --> 24:14.608
or not, but we always assumed that no one would go to 
such heroic expense and trouble if there wasn't

24:05.353 --> 24:14.608
some chance. When I got there, the unit was abuzz 
with the latest scandal, which was that one of the

24:16.681 --> 24:24.889
operating room nurses was a native of St. Louis. 
And she had been very upset because the operating

24:26.070 --> 24:29.653
room did not have a defibrillator. In fact, the 
hospital didn't have the defibrillator. And they

24:34.337 --> 24:37.840
had had a guy die on a table that she really felt that 
they could have defibbed him. He had come back and

24:38.121 --> 24:39.582
made it. But I remember everybody we were working 
on was young, healthy men. I mean, there was

24:42.845 --> 24:46.148
absolutely no excuse to throw in the towel. So she, 
railing at the CO, who's just one of the surgeons,

24:47.883 --> 25:01.279
you know, why don't we have a defibrillator, was 
told it was not T-O-N-E for a MASH hospital because

24:47.883 --> 25:01.279
we were supposed to be a meatball surgery on the 
front lines kind of outfit. She snorted off to her

25:02.100 --> 25:12.372
quarters and sat down and wrote a letter to the CEO 
of Anheuser-Busch and told him all about how she

25:02.100 --> 25:12.372
was a... a Budweiser girl from St. Louis who was 
stuck out there in the middle of the war zone with no

25:14.140 --> 25:23.030
defibrillator and people were dying, good beer 
drinking people were dying of this. And what had

25:24.211 --> 25:42.612
happened was the CEO of Anheuser-Busch picked up 
the phone, ordered the fanciest defibrillator

25:24.211 --> 25:42.612
available and put it on a civilian cargo aircraft 
to the embassy in Saigon with instructions that it

25:24.211 --> 25:42.612
be delivered to the third surgical hospital. and 
then turned around and called his congressman. So

25:47.340 --> 25:52.667
there was a full bore congressional 
investigation about why we didn't have

25:47.340 --> 25:52.667
defibrillators. At the same time, we had the only 
defibrillator in the country at the time. If I say

25:59.956 --> 26:02.739
kingdom, it's because we spent two years in Saudi 
Arabia, too. And

26:03.440 --> 26:08.667
anyway, sure, her name was Mudd. We had more little 
inspection tours and stuff coming around, and I

26:09.187 --> 26:15.476
was brand new and couldn't quite figure out why all 
these fancy, brassy people. At least, having

26:16.498 --> 26:19.742
grown up with the military, I knew they were fancy. 
A lot of my peers didn't even know that. They

26:23.368 --> 26:25.451
thought that was how things always happened. But 
anyway, we just did our thing. That day when I woke

26:30.959 --> 26:35.245
up at noon, they told me that I'd be on day shift on 
the ward the following day and that I better hurry

26:35.900 --> 26:54.502
up and get dressed because there was a party and off 
we lared up to a party and partied until the wee

26:35.900 --> 26:54.502
hours and then went to work in the morning and from 
then on out it was six day weeks and usually twelve

26:35.900 --> 26:54.502
hour days although we went through some slow 
periods when we backed off to eight hour shifts but

26:35.900 --> 26:54.502
that was the norm. How did you cope with the men on 
the ward, the rangers?

27:02.392 --> 27:05.215
I just did what I was supposed to. We have our own 
little ritual that we do in medicine and nursing

27:05.448 --> 27:11.917
and how they got that way. A guy can be crushed 
because a truck falls on him. It doesn't matter

27:15.903 --> 27:24.135
whether it's a cement truck out at a construction 
site or whether it's a military truck in some motor

27:15.903 --> 27:24.135
pool. What we deal with is the crushed chest. And so 
we're obsessed with all our little gadgets and

27:28.533 --> 27:37.605
medicines and ventilators and IVs and how much of 
this has he had and how much did he put out in eight

27:28.533 --> 27:37.605
hours and all that kind of thing. And that's what we 
did. And I don't remember people making a lot of

27:40.189 --> 27:50.663
comments about how we got in the mess. Of course, it 
was early on yet. Did you grow attached to any of

27:53.767 --> 27:55.810
your patients? Oh, grossly so. Because it was this 
buddy ship thing going on. And I guess maybe the

28:00.842 --> 28:03.725
verb attached makes me nervous. Did I ever 
entertain romantic thoughts about them? No. I had

28:10.712 --> 28:17.878
a pretty rousing date life going as it was with 
people who were fit and hale and up and around. And

28:18.419 --> 28:20.521
the patients went through fast. We were a surgical 
hospital. We evacuated as soon as we stabilized.

28:25.105 --> 28:28.088
So it was very seldom that anybody stayed with us 
more than two days. The ones who stayed with us more

28:29.148 --> 28:32.974
than two days were the ones who weren't stable 
enough to evacuate. So they were, you know, not

28:34.636 --> 28:37.600
exactly your romantic dreams. But oddly enough, 
we would get these guys who stayed who were

28:39.123 --> 28:44.490
unstable. Everybody got obsessed with them. And 
it got to where you couldn't have a conversation on

28:48.877 --> 28:53.063
anything else. I had one, Sergeant Pennington, 
who changed my life. because I got mad. I had had a

28:59.841 --> 29:02.504
week and a half of Sergeant Pennington. It had 
finally rolled around. It was my day off. I didn't

29:05.767 --> 29:06.888
have any place to go. I didn't really have anything 
to do. There was a big operation going on. All the

29:09.810 --> 29:10.891
guys were in the field. And, you know, I slept in, 
and I went to lunch, and everybody was talking

29:11.692 --> 29:17.537
about Sergeant Pennington's latest. He was a 
triple amputee, multiple shrapnel, you know,

29:18.138 --> 29:25.885
200-some debris to shrapnel wounds, you know, 
four chest tubes, and he was a mess. And to be

29:26.455 --> 29:28.558
honest, I would be surprised if he lived. We did 
evacuate him alive after about two weeks of fairly

29:28.819 --> 29:33.586
intense stuff. But I really would be surprised if 
in the long term he lived through the whole thing.

29:39.335 --> 29:46.806
But at any rate, I went out to the bathroom to hold 
John. And I mean, they're sitting down. with my

29:50.738 --> 29:57.046
fatigue pants around my ankles, and somebody 
comes in, and while I'm doing that, ask me if I've

29:50.738 --> 29:57.046
heard about the latest about Sergeant 
Pennington. I just, that was it. I finished what I

29:58.328 --> 30:05.096
was doing, strapped on my pants, shoved my wallet 
in my fatigue pants pocket, and I marched down the

29:58.328 --> 30:05.096
road. I'm leaving. I'm not coming back here. 
That's all there is to it. And I went stroking off

30:08.881 --> 30:19.615
down the brigade road, and it was a big circle, 
cantonment road with units on either side of it,

30:08.881 --> 30:19.615
and on the outside of the outside units, the log 
units were on the inside of it and the combat units

30:19.882 --> 30:23.367
were on the outside. And I went down to the brigade 
officer's open mess which was the boom room which

30:24.389 --> 30:47.442
was built out of ammo boxes and it was early yet in 
the afternoon and there wasn't anybody in there

30:24.389 --> 30:47.442
but the bartender and the club officer who was a 
cripple who refused to be evac'd and so they had

30:24.389 --> 30:47.442
found him a light duty job and I demanded a roll of 
nickels and a drink and I was provided the same, and

30:47.725 --> 30:51.630
I sat down to play the slot machine. And I don't know 
how much time passed, but at some point in time,

30:51.650 --> 30:57.859
this young lieutenant materialized at my elbow 
and said, hi, are you a nurse? And I wanted to say, a

30:58.200 --> 31:05.009
really penetrating question, what else will I be 
in this outfit? But instead, I looked into those

31:05.450 --> 31:10.937
big, very beautiful blue eyes and said, yes, why? 
And it was my sweet Lee, who, poor fella, had been,

31:10.957 --> 31:17.226
he'll tell his own story about how come he was where 
he was, but He wasn't out in the shooting having a

31:17.577 --> 31:21.040
good time like everybody else. And he was very 
bored. And then the next day, we went to Saigon

31:22.021 --> 31:26.226
shopping. And after that, we were dating on an 
almost daily basis. And after about two months of

31:29.889 --> 31:33.713
that, he managed to get himself shot. But he backed 
into the third surge and caused quite a bit of

31:33.833 --> 31:46.065
turmoil and amused all the medics, who thought 
that was just really cute to have the young lovers

31:33.833 --> 31:46.065
be patient and nurse. Then, and he asked me to marry 
him that time, and we piddled around another two

31:46.568 --> 31:54.941
months getting our paperwork approved. It's that 
thick, the stack of paperwork we had to have done.

31:59.068 --> 32:03.656
And we got married on the first of January after he 
had gotten wounded the second time. And I'd been

32:04.837 --> 32:10.787
down to see the chaplain about arrangements for 
the wedding because we decided...

32:35.843 --> 32:58.324
to people let me off this thing out ran the bicycle 
back but uh anyway that was the day that four of my

32:35.843 --> 32:58.324
medics came to me and offered to be litter bearers 
at my wedding but

32:35.843 --> 32:58.324
uh we got married and we went to Hong Kong for a week 
on R&R for our honeymoon and we came back and and uh

33:00.194 --> 33:06.200
An engineer company, as a wedding present, built 
us a 12 foot by 24 foot little house in the back of the

33:00.194 --> 33:06.200
hospital. And Lee threw his duffel bag in the 
corner, put his steel pot on his head, and went off

33:06.680 --> 33:11.845
to the ward again. And I went back to the ward, and 
other than the fact that I wasn't living in the

33:11.905 --> 33:20.814
nurse's shack, my little house was 12 feet behind 
the nurse's shack. Everything just went on like

33:21.014 --> 33:22.676
before. My head nurse at the time was a male nurse 
major named Kaminsky, a major cam. called me in he

33:29.607 --> 33:59.175
said jerry i would like to lay a proposition in 
front of you make sure i'm a married woman now he

33:29.607 --> 33:59.175
said that's the point he said i assume that you 
would like to be off whenever lee's in from the

33:29.607 --> 33:59.175
field i said yeah i like that he said i also assume 
that now that you're married and won't be partying

33:29.607 --> 33:59.175
like you have been he said i assume that you really 
don't care about whether you're off or not while

33:29.607 --> 33:59.175
he's out in the field i said well to some degree he 
says about this sport and I will make sure that

34:00.151 --> 34:28.183
you're off duty all the time leaves in from the 
field however long it may be as long as you work

34:00.151 --> 34:28.183
every day he's out done at that point in time their 
norm had been they would go out on Monday and come

34:00.151 --> 34:28.183
back on Friday so I figured this was kind of like 
having every weekend off they stayed gone for 28

34:00.151 --> 34:28.183
days and I worked 12 hour shifts for 28 straight 
days before they came back But I got to give Major

34:28.501 --> 34:29.983
Cam credit. The battalion came in about 8.30 in the 
morning. At 8.45, he was in his nurse suit. He was

34:34.230 --> 34:37.855
counting the narcotics for me, and he personally 
relieved me. And they stayed in for six days. And I

34:40.499 --> 34:45.166
kind of dropped by, and Major Cam said, Let us know 
when you're back. And

34:46.168 --> 34:52.016
that was how we ran it for the whole rest of the time I 
was there. My dad had gotten orders for Da Nang and

34:53.479 --> 34:57.765
had come over in, I want to say April, May, 
something like that. And the Marines were on

35:03.362 --> 35:06.586
13-month tours. The Army was on 12-month tours. 
And so Dad was going to go back in, like, June. And I

35:12.934 --> 35:21.125
had got to thinking about this and had decided 
that, hey, I didn't want to go back and end up in some

35:12.934 --> 35:21.125
place like Walter Reed. And I really, what with 
Basic and Walter Reed, I had 18 months before my

35:22.307 --> 35:28.495
enlistment was up, so... I extended for six 
months, and I did that before Matt Lee. I was

35:31.888 --> 35:35.412
already obligated to the extension. And it worked 
out fine, because he didn't come in country until

35:35.432 --> 35:39.797
July or something like that. He was pretty close to 
my dad's schedule. So I worked out my six-month

35:44.282 --> 35:50.048
extension as a happy young bride, and we left 
together. And

35:50.088 --> 35:54.433
then we went back. Now, there's an incredible 
amount of, anecdotal kinds of things I can do, but

35:57.466 --> 36:02.594
that's an overview. How did the men treat you, the 
corpsmen that you worked with, and in general the

36:03.054 --> 36:08.362
men on the base? Well, it's not possible to talk 
about the men monolithically like that. It was an

36:16.755 --> 36:19.800
individual kind of thing. I had grown up in the 
Marine Corps. Now, where what counted was what was

36:26.592 --> 36:28.635
on your shoulders. And it hit me very fast in the 
Army that this was not necessarily how it was. And

36:34.482 --> 36:36.505
for a woman officer in the Army, it was even worse. 
And it chafed me that I had to prove I was who I

36:37.166 --> 36:46.158
appeared to be before I could get the kinds of 
behaviors I wanted to have. But my dad had given me

36:46.498 --> 36:48.401
some awfully good advice. He suggested that I 
avoid giving direct orders in any way that I could.

36:54.166 --> 36:55.908
and never spare the common courtesies. He says, 
honey, if you please and thank you all the time,

36:55.928 --> 37:01.473
people know you have the right to order them to do 
things. If you please and thank you, everybody

37:02.034 --> 37:06.738
feels nice, and then when you turn around and snap 
an order, watch the dust. And indeed, I only gave an

37:07.899 --> 37:17.529
order once in that assignment, and it was a watch 
the dust operation, and it was a guy who needed to be

37:07.899 --> 37:17.529
trached. He had a neck wound, it had swollen up, he 
was in rigorous breathing, and It was the middle of

37:22.330 --> 37:32.434
the night and one of the corpsmen noticed funky 
noises and went down there and looked at this guy

37:22.330 --> 37:32.434
doing this number and I turned around and just 
snarled, get this, get that. Then I ran over and

37:32.454 --> 37:36.964
personally collared the doctor out of bed and 
dragged him over in his skivvies. And we tracked

37:37.400 --> 37:43.447
that kid in about 90 seconds from when we 
recognized it. And it was funny, because when it

37:44.048 --> 37:51.557
was all over, one of the medics said, gee, 
Lieutenant, I never heard you say something like

37:44.048 --> 37:51.557
that before. I thought, Dad was right. And there 
were a lot of gals with civilian backgrounds who

37:54.240 --> 38:02.670
really were under the impression that they 
weren't supposed to say please and thank you, that

37:54.240 --> 38:02.670
somehow that was unofficially. And yeah, I mean, 
what did they know except what they'd seen in

38:02.710 --> 38:07.255
movies? And I found that if you were good at what you 
did and you walked in and with minimum of fuss did

38:08.112 --> 38:19.683
it, that it was little to nothing. Now, some of the 
younger medics were really susceptible to the

38:21.025 --> 38:30.254
fact that we were American girls over there where 
there wasn't much of that. And they would get these

38:30.734 --> 38:36.820
outrageous crushes and sort of droop around 
worshiping us from afar. We all collected our

38:37.323 --> 38:43.069
share of that kind of attention, but I think that 
was inevitable. Some of the older guys moved into

38:44.450 --> 38:51.417
young uncle and big brother roles just for the 
closeness, I really do think. It was something

38:51.738 --> 38:59.346
that they could conscious-wise feel okay about, 
but they could be around a feminine presence. I'd

38:59.706 --> 39:06.553
make phone calls on the switch, those dumb field 
telephones you have to crank, and get the switch

39:07.259 --> 39:12.065
operator, and he'd say, are you an American girl? 
I'd say, no, I'm a lieutenant in the nurse corps.

39:14.608 --> 39:15.930
I'm at the Third Surge Hospital. And he'd say, just 
keep talking. Just keep talking. I want to call the

39:20.275 --> 39:22.057
name switch. I'll put you through. Just keep 
talking to me while I'm doing it. One thing was for

39:27.144 --> 39:28.045
sure. We never had any trouble hitchhiking. And I 
never felt at risk, because I was always in groups.

39:34.993 --> 39:36.355
And I was always treated with utter courtesy I 
think that it you know when a truckload of guys

39:36.942 --> 39:59.355
stopped and picked you up when you wanted to 
hitchhike over to the PX at the air base well no one

39:36.942 --> 39:59.355
was going to get away with being discourteous to 
you without you know five or six others pounds

39:36.942 --> 39:59.355
there wasn't enough of you to go around that's for 
sure so nobody was going to get away with it uh I had a

39:36.942 --> 39:59.355
drunk bank a pass at me once on the pass bus and and I 
cold cocked him and got threatened with being

40:00.044 --> 40:24.060
charged with striking an enlisted man which i 
thought was a little unfair but the person who was

40:00.044 --> 40:24.060
threatening me with that did not follow through 
how did you feel about the vietnamese and um our

40:00.044 --> 40:24.060
side their side well let me finish the man issue 
okay the thing that wrangled with me is i felt like

40:00.044 --> 40:24.060
the male nurses got all the fun The month before I 
arrived, a couple of the more fun-loving nurses

40:25.137 --> 40:39.016
from the hospital in Saigon had been off with some 
boyfriends, fellows with wives and children,

40:25.137 --> 40:39.016
back home and feel great pay and a helicopter to 
fly. And they had been out joyriding in a

40:39.857 --> 40:43.402
helicopter, and the chopper had crashed. They had 
taken it through some high-tension wires, and it

40:43.422 --> 40:46.526
was probably pilot error. At any rate, the 
command's response to this was to forbid all

40:47.528 --> 40:54.317
female personnel from flying in rotor-driven 
aircraft. except on orders. Well, I just took this

40:58.335 --> 41:12.511
as a tremendous... Because every time they wanted 
someone to escort a... You know, we'd have

40:58.335 --> 41:12.511
somebody we had intubated who had to be 
hand-bagged down to the neurosurgeon in Saigon or

40:58.335 --> 41:12.511
something, which to me was just, you know, combat 
excitement. Oh, boy, medics at their best. I

41:14.493 --> 41:15.674
wanted to do this. And they always let the male 
nurses go because then they didn't have to cut

41:16.135 --> 41:19.318
orders. Whereas if they'd have sent one of us, 
they'd have had to sit down with a typewriter and

41:20.159 --> 41:23.443
cut orders. Now, I took this as a challenge, and I 
managed to explore all the possibilities of

41:25.027 --> 41:46.520
fixed-wing aircraft during my stay to the extent 
that I flew out to the field to see my husband in an

41:25.027 --> 41:46.520
L-19, which was not exactly what they had in mind by 
making that rule about rotor-driven aircraft.

41:46.540 --> 41:48.303
But you know what an L-19 is? Spot a plane. Yeah. It 
was fun. It didn't take much charm to get my

41:50.914 --> 41:59.185
permission to do that, but they had to call the CO of 
the 9th Attack Air Force to get permission. Good

41:59.966 --> 42:03.270
thing they didn't ask me whether I had permission, 
because I didn't. But I told them where I was going,

42:04.692 --> 42:07.015
they just didn't know what it was. You know, I just 
told them the name. They didn't recognize it and

42:09.037 --> 42:11.721
didn't want to show their ignorance by asking me. 
It was a new chief nurse who'd only been in the

42:11.741 --> 42:14.444
country two weeks. So, you know, I signed out on the 
board and left. It was great. But I finally cracked

42:19.735 --> 42:23.478
the gender barrier in pre-op. After I'd been there 
about nine months, the major asked me if I wanted to

42:23.498 --> 42:29.664
transfer to pre-op. And I said, I've wanted to 
transfer to pre-op since I got here. That's where

42:32.326 --> 42:33.988
it's at. That's what I want to do. And she said, 
well, you know, you'll be the only girl. I said,

42:37.771 --> 42:43.737
it's OK. And so I was the only girl nurse in pre-op 
for about six months. And it was funny. The medics

42:46.859 --> 42:49.742
had their poker game going in the back room. When 
you're the only nurse on, well, they're, you know.

42:52.542 --> 42:56.588
I mean, the male nurses played poker with them, but 
they never even asked me. I had this real complex

42:57.569 --> 43:16.658
Revlon nail care kit that I had treated myself to, 
and so when we'd get everything all stocked up and

42:57.569 --> 43:16.658
cleaned up and ready for whatever might come, give 
a couple of DPT shots and be ready to settle in for

42:57.569 --> 43:16.658
the rest of the day, I would get this Revlon kit out, 
and I would commence to give myself a long and

42:57.569 --> 43:16.658
painstaking manicure. Well, it never failed that 
on the second layer of paint tacky,

43:17.397 --> 43:24.390
in would come. And we'd be in the mud and the web gear 
and the, you know, all that. And you'd have to strip

43:31.443 --> 43:33.988
it all off and start all over again. About the third 
time I did that, the sergeant who was the lead medic

43:34.458 --> 43:42.329
on the shift said, Lieutenant, I'd really 
appreciate it if you wouldn't do that when you're

43:34.458 --> 43:42.329
on duty. I said, well, geez, you know, you're 
always on duty here. Wouldn't you expect me to do

43:44.252 --> 43:45.393
it? He said, well, look, the guys are kind of 
superstitious about it. They have noticed that

43:48.998 --> 43:54.947
every time you're almost done, that your manicure 
gets ruined by incoming casualties. And, you

43:54.967 --> 44:00.294
know, we'd really appreciate it if you'd do it on 
night shift. So, but other than that, I have to

44:00.314 --> 44:03.098
admit, they again if you could do the job and and 
then then acceptance was not a big problem the news

44:03.955 --> 44:26.942
media drove me nuts though oh they'd love to come 
out and interview us and they always wanted to ask

44:03.955 --> 44:26.942
you questions like do you feel that you represent 
the wives mothers and sweethearts of america

44:03.955 --> 44:26.942
because a man fighting in the war i'd say no i really 
don't see i'm a lieutenant in the army And I'm a

44:27.310 --> 44:36.484
nurse, and I've got my own job here, and I do it, and 
they're my buddies, and they do their jobs, and I

44:27.310 --> 44:36.484
expect them to shoot people, and I expect to take 
care of them when they get shot. And that's how it

44:36.945 --> 44:37.586
is. I'm not representing anybody's anything. I'm 
just me. Never did what they taped or shot of me end

44:41.793 --> 44:45.759
up on the air. I was not giving them the answers they 
came to get.

44:51.588 --> 44:52.790
What's next, the Vietnamese? How did you feel 
about the Vietnamese? Well, I came from a family

44:56.217 --> 45:03.425
environment where bigotry wasn't supported. The 
Marine Corps integrated its schools when I was a

45:04.526 --> 45:10.773
youngster, even though the schools off post 
weren't. And I grew up with blacks and Koreans and

45:10.794 --> 45:17.561
Germans and all the foreign wives. A lot of my 
friends had foreign mothers who were naturalized

45:18.062 --> 45:23.608
Americans by that time. and my mother and father 
just had never any patience with anybody putting

45:24.685 --> 45:52.937
anybody down it's funny in retrospect I realize 
that the family does have one very bad failing is

45:24.685 --> 45:52.937
their intellectual snobs didn't have much much 
patience with dumb people but as long as you could

45:24.685 --> 45:52.937
hold your own right wise it didn't matter what 
color or shade or religion you were so with that as

45:24.685 --> 45:52.937
my background I had uh and I always liked languages 
and I've been interested in other countries

45:24.685 --> 45:52.937
cultures not going near the foreign service 
school thing So I had already read all the little

45:53.508 --> 45:57.533
books they had out about what's going on in 
Vietnam. And I had made a stab at learning the

45:57.753 --> 46:03.280
language, which was difficult. The language is so 
regional that you go 50 kilometers and they can't

46:04.882 --> 46:10.510
understand you. The accents are so heavy. Even 
words are different. And a lot of people didn't

46:14.915 --> 46:17.859
really realize that. And it's like some of those 
places in Africa where one country with 80

46:21.790 --> 46:23.653
dialects. There's over 200 dialects in India, 
although it's a fairly large country, but still

46:24.794 --> 46:30.623
200 languages. So I kind of peeled off. Now, I spoke 
French at that point in time. I'd had four years in

46:36.511 --> 46:38.414
high school. And most of the Vietnamese who were 
over 35 who were educated spoke French. So I was

46:44.362 --> 46:51.392
able to deal with folk in the market and that kind of 
thing in French instead of in English. But I didn't

46:52.283 --> 46:58.111
ever know any Vietnamese people. I mean, even the 
ones that were employed in our compound. I mean,

47:01.636 --> 47:05.561
the truck came up, they got off, they went to their 
jobs, and they worked. And it was, good morning,

47:05.581 --> 47:07.885
how are you? Did I say that right? Teach me the word 
for. But I didn't even know whether some of these

47:12.091 --> 47:16.717
women were married or not or whether they had 
children or not. To be quite honest, I wasn't

47:16.917 --> 47:19.641
interested.
