00:01.313 --> 00:10.468
When I was there, one of the first things I was asked 
to do was look at the regulations in regard to their

00:01.313 --> 00:10.468
agreement with federal regulations. And I took 
one look at it and I said, hey guys, we're in

00:10.568 --> 00:14.174
violation. And they said, well, what do you 
recommend we do? And I said, I recommend one of two

00:17.118 --> 00:19.382
things. One is you can initiate procedures which 
will probably trigger the review they told us that

00:19.562 --> 00:26.393
they were ultimately going to get around to. and 
they'll say we have to change it or two you can go

00:27.267 --> 00:53.933
downstairs and tell the city council and their 
attitude is the hell with it or three you can ignore

00:27.267 --> 00:53.933
it well we ignored it for about six months to eight 
months and the review finally got around and they

00:27.267 --> 00:53.933
told us that if we did not modify our ordinances to 
conform they are going to uh no this is a fia flip

00:27.267 --> 00:53.933
insurance administration but

00:54.925 --> 01:04.845
that if we did not perform, they would suspend all 
FDIC institutions from loaning any money for

00:54.925 --> 01:04.845
development and purchases of property inside the 
city of Galveston. Well, you know, that kind of

01:04.866 --> 01:08.513
excites everybody because there's lots of money 
there. And the outcome was we finally got an

01:09.016 --> 01:15.328
ordinance adopted after a lot of screaming and 
yelling. I had a very good ordinance drafted, but

01:15.388 --> 01:28.172
it was too long and complex for the politicals to 
put up with, so they threw it out and adopted a short

01:15.388 --> 01:28.172
four-page type ordinance that was much more 
restrictive. Now, the reason it was was because

01:28.456 --> 01:45.773
politically it looked better to have a short 
four-page typed ordinance that people could read

01:28.456 --> 01:45.773
and understand instead of having one that was much 
more specific about what you could do if you could

01:28.456 --> 01:45.773
do the following things to protect the system, 
which got to be about 25, 30 pages long. specifying

01:47.457 --> 01:54.710
wiring, ventilation systems, and all kinds of 
things. So the outcome was they adopted that

01:54.730 --> 02:05.871
ordinance and they had periodically given 
exemptions, which are complete violations of the

01:54.730 --> 02:05.871
federal regs, to industrial and commercial 
facilities.

02:08.855 --> 02:11.058
I'm going to have to run it a little bit. Right. How 
would you characterize the planning style at

02:12.339 --> 02:29.361
Galveston as, for example, would it be considered 
basically kind of oriented toward a general

02:12.339 --> 02:29.361
comprehensive plan, sort of synoptic? concept of 
planning, a holistic approach, or would it be

02:29.341 --> 02:49.338
incremental planning, opportunism, would it be 
advocacy planning, would it be radical planning,

02:29.341 --> 02:49.338
structural changes in government, for example, 
caused by any... I think in general what I saw in

02:49.358 --> 02:52.885
Galveston was that there was too much weight there 
to try certain things. There was a very real sense

02:57.481 --> 03:01.149
of pragmatism. Can we get this done? Can we get it 
through? Should we spend time on it at this stage?

03:08.153 --> 03:19.830
There was a lot of advocacy planning that was going 
on and that would get hot and people would stop

03:08.153 --> 03:19.830
being advocates and become bureaucrats or 
technocrats again for a while. There was a lot of

03:21.452 --> 03:26.179
arm twisting, political interaction. There was, 
I think, some commitment to comprehensive

03:26.159 --> 03:36.756
planning, and the plan was being basically used as 
the document from which a lot of these proposals

03:26.159 --> 03:36.756
for action would occur. You know, street 
closures, park development, linear parks, In

03:42.730 --> 03:50.384
other words, the plan became kind of a basis of 
ideas for which practical advocate kinds of

03:42.730 --> 03:50.384
activities occurred. I think there was that 
commitment. Now, on the other hand, you kind of

03:53.630 --> 04:00.503
look at it and there were some things that happened 
that maybe didn't relate that closely to the plan,

03:53.630 --> 04:00.503
but I think there was general consensus that okay 
the plan is in many cases abstract or vague enough

04:00.685 --> 04:27.317
we don't understand what that means but here's an 
opportunity let's grab it and federal money was

04:00.685 --> 04:27.317
viewed as an opportunity and we'll take it we'll 
find a way to make it fit within the community and

04:00.685 --> 04:27.317
the plan very good kevin thank you very much for all 
of your help on this and if we have any follow-up
