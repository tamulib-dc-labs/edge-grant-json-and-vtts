WEBVTT

00:03.271 --> 00:09.604
First, would you discuss your academic training 
and how you became attracted to oceanography? Oh,

00:09.624 --> 00:12.089
yeah. I went to Allegheny College in Meadville, 
Pennsylvania. Does the level look all right? Yes,

00:18.022 --> 00:20.487
the level looks fine.

00:27.318 --> 00:30.642
And I always thought I wanted to be a physicist so I 
wouldn't have to deal with many people. It seemed

00:30.682 --> 00:33.205
to make a great idea. I remember telling a friend of 
mine I was working with once, that's why I was going

00:33.786 --> 00:39.012
to be a physicist. Then I worked for, after school I 
took a job with Magnaflux, which is a magnetic

00:41.375 --> 00:50.106
inspection system. The fellow was an alumni from 
the school. He happened to be back the June I was

00:53.930 --> 00:56.072
graduating. He offered me a job, and so I took it. It 
would be an hour, hour and a half. And so I got a job.

01:08.226 --> 01:09.828
They weren't too easy to find them. So I worked for 
Magnaflux for about two years. And I was thinking

01:14.493 --> 01:16.015
about going back to school. I got married, and this 
is 1940, and I got married in 1941. In fact, I went

01:20.900 --> 01:23.143
off to graduate school in I got offered an 
assistantship, and then I felt I just wouldn't be

01:24.085 --> 01:39.983
able to survive with all the social and emotional 
problems, wanting to get married and getting $30 a

01:24.085 --> 01:39.983
month for being a graduate assistant and so on. I 
went back to work for Magnaflux. I stayed with them

01:43.207 --> 01:52.337
for two years, and by then the war had started, and I 
was going to join the Army, and they told me I should

01:43.207 --> 01:52.337
take this job at Lockheed. expecting overseas. I 
went over and worked in Ireland for a year at an Air

01:54.007 --> 01:58.813
Force base repairing airplanes. And I came back 
in, I went into the Army, and then I got into the Navy

01:59.995 --> 02:04.661
and got out in 1946.

02:07.385 --> 02:12.171
And we had lived in Chicago, in a very nice place to 
live, north of Chicago, Glenview. I know you

02:12.191 --> 02:13.853
probably don't know that. It was a very 
comfortable, nice little log cabin out in the

02:14.594 --> 02:17.779
country. So we moved back there after the war, and I 
went over to Northwestern, and I with a GI Bill

02:22.237 --> 02:25.020
applied and got in the physics department. So I 
spent two years there. And while I was there, Sam

02:29.664 --> 02:33.068
Goudsmit was there. He was a fairly famous 
physicist. I started doing my thesis work under

02:36.631 --> 02:38.473
him. And then he moved to Brookhaven. And I moved to 
Brookhaven in 1948 with him and finished my thesis

02:40.876 --> 02:51.366
there and started working on another thing and got 
my degree in 1949. I stayed at Brookhaven two

02:52.088 --> 02:58.336
years, working on the time-of-flight mass 
spectrometer. And I'd always wanted to teach, so

02:58.356 --> 03:07.588
we left Brookhaven and went to the University of 
Toledo, where I taught in the physics department

02:58.356 --> 03:07.588
for six years. And during those summers, the first 
summer we stayed in Toledo, and the next two

03:08.910 --> 03:17.380
summers we went down to Los Alamos to work for the 
summer. And the next summer, which is 1955, asked

03:21.940 --> 03:24.503
me to come back to Brookhaven for the summer. So I 
went back there and was working with him. And this

03:27.668 --> 03:30.191
is how I got into oceanography, basically. It's a 
sort of interesting story. I was crossing a field,

03:32.895 --> 03:35.999
and a fellow was working. The guy that does 
neutrino experiments was working on his

03:36.540 --> 03:42.728
equipment, and I went over to help him. He was 
having sort of a bad day, and he said, we ought to go

03:42.748 --> 03:47.695
to a place like Woods Hole. And where you have fun. 
There's a lot of interesting problems. And you get

03:51.099 --> 03:53.582
out and you sail around and see the world. Really 
nice. And I said, gee, that's a great idea. Went

03:58.066 --> 03:59.287
back to work. Then we went back to Toledo. And the 
first physics of the day I picked up when I got home

04:00.508 --> 04:07.394
had an advertisement in it from Woods Hole asking 
about physicists. So I wrote this fellow a letter

04:08.495 --> 04:13.119
saying, why don't you write too, and I'll write, 
and we'll see what happens. And I wrote, and he

04:14.100 --> 04:16.382
didn't. So we came the next summer in 1956 to Woods 
Hole, worked the summer. Once we were on the Cape

04:21.663 --> 04:24.628
for a summer, why, we were hooked. Convinced then 
oceanography was for you? We were convinced

04:26.251 --> 04:28.053
oceanography was for us. So really your Navy 
experience didn't have anything to do with it?

04:30.878 --> 04:32.441
Very little, no. Nothing at all, really. My Navy 
experience had very little to do with ships. It was

04:37.609 --> 04:41.756
an anti-submarine weapon, classified thing. You 
know, it was... Like most of the Navy, it doesn't

04:43.092 --> 04:45.494
have much to do with the ocean. It's an 
inconvenience. But a lot of oceanographers came

04:47.877 --> 04:50.619
to that, and he said, right? Oh, yes, right. Well, a 
lot of the people in the acoustics work, of course,

04:51.540 --> 04:59.688
were associated with the Navy, and it's sort of a 
natural thing to gravitate to, in a way. When I came

05:01.129 --> 05:08.036
here, I thought I was really interested in doing 
some tracer experiments, using radioactive

05:01.129 --> 05:08.036
stuff, and so on. I went to work for Brackett. 
Hersey, and he was in acoustics, and so I started

05:09.923 --> 05:15.308
doing acoustics, and I've been there ever since. 
It's just that simple. And I assume that when you

05:17.450 --> 05:24.476
were at Los Alamos, you were doing primarily 
nuclear energy measurements, right? Okay. So

05:26.378 --> 05:32.123
it's really almost as if you're transferring 
fields to go into acoustics. Yeah, really. What

05:33.644 --> 05:35.326
was your reaction then to acoustics? How did you 
choose it? Well, it was the thing to do when we were

05:36.747 --> 05:38.608
here. That was the That was a big thing. I came to 
work for Brackett, and that's what he was doing. So

05:45.536 --> 05:48.419
that's what I started doing. And I just never shook 
loose. There was a lot of other interesting things

05:51.661 --> 05:53.423
to do. Eventually, then, I got, while I was working 
for Brackett,

05:55.605 --> 06:09.698
we got involved with the Illuminat between Woods 
Hole

06:12.209 --> 06:15.532
The Navy and Reynolds Metals. Reynolds Metals was 
building a submarine called the Illuminat. The

06:20.837 --> 06:24.481
Navy wanted to get in somebody into the deep diving 
business. And it looked like by giving us the

06:24.561 --> 06:33.310
money, we could charter the, make a deal with 
Reynolds to run the Illuminat. And we were looking

06:33.330 --> 06:36.373
for somebody to sort of run that program. So I left 
acoustics at that time and took over that program.

06:42.517 --> 06:51.145
and due to some problem in making a negotiation, 
why we didn't do business with Reynolds. Instead,

06:51.165 --> 06:55.490
we got money from the Navy and built the Alvin. So 
from 1961, approximately, until 1966, one of my

06:55.510 --> 07:08.322
major concerns was Alvin, getting it rented, the 
whole problem there. In 1962, we formed

07:08.682 --> 07:11.325
departments. And I became department chairman of 
applied oceanography.

07:18.444 --> 07:21.188
So that was a break with the acoustics. But then in 
66, about 65 or 66, Hersey had become department

07:21.208 --> 07:29.518
chairman of geology and geophysics. And the 
acoustics had stayed in there. And in that time,

07:32.022 --> 07:37.008
when he left, I was sort of the logical one to take 
over that department. So I became chairman of

07:37.028 --> 07:40.232
geology and geophysics And I did that until 1969. 
And I kept the applied oceanography for a year, and

07:42.707 --> 07:53.946
then Scott Dobbin came here, took over applied 
oceanography, and then changed the name to Ocean

07:42.707 --> 07:53.946
Engineering. So this is sort of the department I 
had back in the early 60s, basically. From 69 to 71,

07:59.456 --> 08:06.608
I went to La Spezia and was deputy director over 
there for two years, admittedly. But when I came

08:07.617 --> 08:14.043
back, Scott Dobbin was leaving, so I became 
chairman of the ocean engineering department.

08:14.063 --> 08:20.089
Jim Hertzler had taken on the department 
chairmanship of geology and geophysics, and I

08:14.063 --> 08:20.089
went to Las Vegas. So it was all pretty simple. 
Okay. Well, let's sort of follow in order. The new

08:28.237 --> 08:29.978
field, acoustics. Okay. What sort of 
experimentation were you involved in, and was

08:31.059 --> 08:37.185
this the first time you'd gone out to sea for any 
length of time? Yeah, really. I'd been on a ship.

08:40.985 --> 08:47.211
I'd ridden a ship when I was in the Navy in some 
places, but nothing. It's different. You're

08:49.513 --> 08:52.876
almost a passenger, unless you're on the decan or 
something. I was always a passenger, basically,

08:52.956 --> 08:56.499
because of the work we did. So this is the first 
experiment in going to sea, right? There wasn't

09:01.544 --> 09:03.326
any major upheaval. I mean, I guess acoustics is 
physics. Physics works. It's interesting and

09:10.372 --> 09:13.937
complicated, but there wasn't anything. There 
was a lot to learn, of course, because of the

09:14.057 --> 09:25.731
details and all of the problems and the 
approximations and where things work and where

09:14.057 --> 09:25.731
they don't work and why they do that. You just have 
to learn that type of thing. There wasn't anything

09:28.134 --> 09:32.039
fundamentally different from doing a lot of other 
things in a way. Do you feel that to be a good

09:33.921 --> 09:36.805
oceanographer, you have to go to sea? No, don't 
believe that at all. Jules Verne was a pretty good

09:41.814 --> 09:44.397
oceanographer, I think. I don't think he ever left 
a four or five block area to perish, as far as I know.

09:51.064 --> 09:55.950
Well, I just wonder, because more and more, at 
least people in physics and oceanography go to sea

09:51.064 --> 09:55.950
less and less. Yeah, well, that's true. But then I 
think the world of oceanography is becoming more

10:00.435 --> 10:08.344
and more quantitative. Analysis problems are 
getting much more important in the thing and not so

10:09.539 --> 10:19.409
much the exploration. When people first went to 
see, they were just finding out what was there. And

10:23.573 --> 10:26.676
I assume your first acoustical work was really 
just finding out what was there? No, the first one,

10:28.017 --> 10:30.760
they had a pretty good program. We got involved in 
some propagation work, which is you make noises

10:30.920 --> 10:36.846
and listen some distance away, and you see how the 
sound is propagated through the water, and try to

10:37.450 --> 10:49.025
understand why it behaves the way it does. People 
are still doing the same experiment, basically.

10:54.473 --> 10:59.459
Different frequencies, different scales, and 
different places. Who worked on this early

10:59.479 --> 11:02.584
acoustical work besides yourself? Oh, well, this 
wasn't really early. This was in the 1957, don't

11:04.106 --> 11:07.390
forget. Oh, Percy, Alan Vine, Bud Knott, the local 
group here, Betty Bunce, Henry Johnson, Dick

11:08.365 --> 11:22.798
Backus. We ran sort of a sideshow in some of the 
things. We got on cruises, and we'd do propagation

11:25.940 --> 11:29.463
work. Echo sounding was not very, it was just 
getting into its own at that time, and just knowing

11:30.364 --> 11:38.271
what the shape of the bottom light was. It's 
beginning to be recognized as being more and more

11:38.572 --> 11:42.656
important and easier to do. Started to do seismic 
profiling, which is a echo sounding where you look

11:44.798 --> 11:53.167
into the bottom to see what the layers are like. 
This is the big tool that the oil companies use now

11:53.608 --> 11:57.572
all the time. Bracket. But not for two of the people 
who put this into sort of a routine production

11:59.113 --> 12:06.621
mode, you might say. It's become a great big thing 
with the oil companies now, of course. They've far

12:11.413 --> 12:18.580
surpassed what we do, just because they have so 
much more money to spend on equipment. And we

12:18.600 --> 12:20.121
worked with people from Daystrom. We worked with 
people from NRL, from New London. We went out and

12:25.306 --> 12:27.188
looked at submarines. You know, one of the 
problems you are is looking at echos from

12:27.208 --> 12:31.212
submarines. How far can you see them?

12:35.373 --> 12:36.274
Any problem? No problem at all. I just want to check 
and make sure we don't have any. Okay. And then we

12:41.178 --> 12:43.100
worked on propagation. We did some ambient noise. 
We did some bottom reflectivity.

12:50.627 --> 12:53.490
Did a lot of volume reverberation with Dick 
Backus. This is looking at the scattering back

12:53.510 --> 12:57.213
from little creatures in the sea. A lot of these 
problems are still being worked on. What's

13:01.537 --> 13:02.578
happened is the Technology's changed so much. You 
can do a lot more now easier than you could before.

13:10.116 --> 13:11.939
The ideas haven't changed very much. This is one of 
the interesting things that happens in most

13:12.039 --> 13:20.389
science, oceanography in particular. If you look 
at acoustics particularly, if you look back in the

13:20.669 --> 13:32.644
early literature, you can see statements about 
doing things that they just couldn't do because

13:20.669 --> 13:32.644
they didn't have the technical capability that we 
do routinely now. It's really very deep. Yeah, and

13:33.811 --> 13:38.636
this is happening in all fields, of course. Do you 
attribute this portion to a fallout from space

13:38.656 --> 13:42.260
technology? Oh, it would have happened whether 
space technology was there or not, I think.

13:47.546 --> 13:53.592
Because it accelerated some of the problems, I 
think. But I think the big things have been

13:53.612 --> 14:02.502
development of the computer and the solid state

13:53.612 --> 14:02.502
equipment It's just made everything better. And 
I'm sure that would have happened anyhow. I think

14:06.775 --> 14:13.341
the people weren't really worried about that in 
the Bell Labs when they developed the first

14:06.775 --> 14:13.341
transistors. That's just put more money into it, 
really. So you would judge, at least in your

14:20.307 --> 14:29.515
experience in oceanography, the computer and 
transistor to be the most important technical

14:20.307 --> 14:29.515
advances, or would you choose others? Well, I 
think they are the most important technical

14:29.535 --> 14:32.117
advances. Well, everybody's biased because of 
the particular thing he does. Sure. If somebody

14:38.554 --> 14:43.760
wanted to measure, well, even the people who 
measure currents would probably tend to agree

14:38.554 --> 14:43.760
with that. Because you can build little things you 
can put out there that last a long time, use very

14:44.862 --> 14:52.932
little power, and store a lot of information. 
That's the problem in a lot of these measurements.

14:57.497 --> 15:00.501
I think that's reasonable. Now, after doing 
acoustical work for really the first several

15:00.768 --> 15:10.121
years, what made you change to underwater 
technology? Well, it just sounded like it might be

15:11.443 --> 15:14.608
fun. Okay. Simple enough. Yeah, we were going to 
get this deep submersible, and nobody really,

15:18.173 --> 15:30.150
well, they had these bathyscaps, which were quite 
immobile, you know, They can get down deep, but

15:30.856 --> 15:33.260
they can't move around much. It just seemed like 
it'd be a nifty thing to do, to be able to build

15:33.280 --> 15:41.592
something that could get down and you could go 
around and look at things and take pictures and so

15:33.280 --> 15:41.592
on. It turned out to be very successful, actually. 
Although at first you received some criticism.

15:47.060 --> 15:48.822
Well, it always does. Well, when they came to you 
with the idea, what was your first reaction? Which

15:54.491 --> 15:55.012
idea? The idea of the submersible. Well, we were 
already, Woods Hole was, already somewhat

16:01.079 --> 16:03.543
committed to this line. We were trying to 
negotiate this thing with Reynolds and through

16:05.005 --> 16:09.371
the Navy. And I just happened to be talking to Bill 
Rainey one day about it. And he asked me if I'd be

16:14.078 --> 16:15.440
interested. You see, he came to be basically a 
pilot and one of the chief engineers on it. We

16:22.010 --> 16:29.261
wanted somebody else to sort of head up the whole 
thing and do more of the interaction with other

16:22.010 --> 16:29.261
people and so on. So he asked me if I'd be 
interested. about it and said, yeah, sounds like

16:31.538 --> 16:34.785
an interesting thing to do. I stayed active in some 
of the acoustics work during that time. I went on

16:41.760 --> 16:46.029
quite a few different cruises that had nothing to 
do with the submarine. But my major effort was on

16:46.069 --> 16:52.382
the submarine during that time for about four or 
five years. That was my number one worry, I guess,

16:52.700 --> 16:57.027
is the best way to say it. Was the number one worry 
attached to it in designing it or in raising money

16:57.107 --> 17:03.058
for it or what? Just the mechanics of getting the 
thing designed, built, operating. You know,

17:12.313 --> 17:14.497
there are a lot of unknowns in those things. You get 
a lot of

17:20.543 --> 17:23.106
critics or people who worry about different 
things. A lot of them are justified, and each one

17:23.187 --> 17:30.116
they worry about, you have to look at and see 
whether it's real or not real. Answer the

17:30.136 --> 17:33.200
question, go or no go, one way or the other. It

17:33.220 --> 17:41.711
turned out that the hull, before we built the 
hulls, nobody had built hulls like that. The hulls

17:44.034 --> 17:47.479
for the Bathurst calves are really overdone. 
Well, we were really worried about weight, and we

17:48.488 --> 17:56.778
were trying to get down to reasonable thickness 
and yet still have a good safety factor. Well, we

17:56.798 --> 18:03.246
had much discussion about the hulls and the design 
and the shape they were going to be and all this

17:56.798 --> 18:03.246
business. Finally built them, and they turned out 
to be much better than anybody. The tests on them

18:07.532 --> 18:15.762
showed they were much better than anybody had 
designed, thought they were going to be, which was

18:07.532 --> 18:15.762
sort of nice. And there were just a whole host of 
problems like that. And then you have the

18:19.639 --> 18:21.201
administrative. I mean, the company building 
them had underestimated the cost, which is not

18:22.142 --> 18:26.466
unusual. And part of it was certainly legitimate 
and honest. And part of it just wasn't good

18:32.952 --> 18:35.495
management. And when you run a business like this, 
you have to be a little bit hard-nosed. You just

18:39.498 --> 18:46.305
can't give them everything that they want because 
they think they didn't make money or lost money on

18:39.498 --> 18:46.305
deals. You have to run it as a business as well as a 
science. So that took quite a bit of time. And

18:52.763 --> 18:56.048
different ideas about things. And then, of 
course, there's the first time you start testing

18:56.088 --> 19:02.358
it, first time you put people down and they go deep. 
You have a lot of worries. And we lowered it down on a

19:04.322 --> 19:09.710
big string down to 6,000 feet before we put anybody 
in it to go down that far. And that was a very

19:09.730 --> 19:13.356
interesting week we did that. had a million 
dollars hanging on the end of the string down

19:14.315 --> 19:17.800
there. Okay. In terms of design, first, and 
problems with design, except for the thickness of

19:20.684 --> 19:31.820
the hull, what seemed to be your next major 
problem? What were you concerned about most in

19:31.840 --> 19:37.808
terms

19:31.840 --> 19:37.808
of design? Well, it's the whole host of, not minor 
things, but a whole host of things we'd never done

19:45.213 --> 19:46.535
before. We wanted batteries, and we wanted to be 
able to drop the batteries in case a submarine gets

19:46.595 --> 19:52.164
hung up somewhere. Why do you want to be able to drop 
the batteries? Submarine gets lighter, and then

19:55.509 --> 19:59.655
it'll come to the surface. And this took quite a 
bit, getting a decent package for the batteries.

20:02.740 --> 20:12.435
We decided to use lead acid batteries, because 
even though they're not the most efficient, it

20:02.740 --> 20:12.435
turns out they're not too bad, and they're fairly 
economical. We didn't have the least clue as to

20:13.073 --> 20:20.301
whether we were going to have to drop one set of 
these every month or every four months. We've

20:20.381 --> 20:22.503
never dropped a set yet, it turns out. And another 
problem we worried about was building the thing so

20:24.345 --> 20:36.178
that the whole sphere, the part with the people in 
it, could be released from the rest of it in case the

20:24.345 --> 20:36.178
rest of it got tangled up. Then you hang up, and you 
can unhook the sphere, and the people come to the

20:36.665 --> 20:43.153
top, even with only half the submarine. And 
getting that thing designed and so it worked right

20:44.014 --> 20:56.208
took a lot of problems, because it's under high 
stress, the release mechanism. And the first one

20:56.268 --> 20:58.271
we built galled a little bit. So it was just, again, 
stainless steel on stainless steel. So we had to

21:03.697 --> 21:04.838
change that. Every one of those steps. You find out 
about it, and then you have to change it. It's an

21:09.531 --> 21:10.191
agony. Who consulted with you on the design and the 
design problems? Well, we had a fellow, Bud

21:14.457 --> 21:22.566
Froelich, who really originated the design out 
in, he was working for General Mills at the time.

21:25.390 --> 21:27.512
And he was, the people there were very good. The 
engineering group there were really quite good on

21:27.793 --> 21:32.338
it, worked hard, did a good job. And we talked, of 
course, we were being, Because we were spending

21:34.225 --> 21:38.090
Navy money, we were being monitored by the Navy all 
the time. We consulted with them, and then we had a

21:38.811 --> 21:50.367
different set of relations with different groups 
in the Navy, some very encouraging and some a

21:38.811 --> 21:50.367
little discouraging. We had minor flare-ups with 
different people who thought this just wouldn't

21:50.387 --> 21:58.617
work this way or something like that. No big deals, 
but each one good for a week or so. Did your money,

22:02.339 --> 22:04.041
did they become O&R? Yeah, O&R, right. A fellow 
named Swede Momsen, who was the son of the Momsen

22:06.464 --> 22:12.410
and the Momsen Lung. He really pushed the thing, 
couldn't he? Really good. That way was fine. But

22:18.757 --> 22:24.283
the motors, the drive motors were a problem 
because they had to run in oil. You know, down at

22:25.845 --> 22:30.270
these pressures and everything has to be pressure 
correlated and then we had the You have to be able to

22:31.381 --> 22:37.212
change the, essentially change the volume of the 
submarine so you stay neutral when you're

22:31.381 --> 22:37.212
floating down there. That was rather 
interesting. That worked fine. We've since

22:41.620 --> 22:43.203
changed that system. We now have a, we've pumped 
saltwater, seawater in and out of some spheres now

22:43.223 --> 22:50.396
in the album the way she is now. Well, the biggest 
problem was a little one with the, When we made the

22:57.858 --> 23:05.128
first 6,000-foot test, we had trouble with the 
main propulsion in the steering motors. And this

23:07.492 --> 23:13.420
cost us about three months of work before we found 
out what the problem was. You get down and dive, and

23:13.921 --> 23:16.785
you get down to 2,000 or 3,000 feet. And sometimes 
these things would want to stay running, even

23:17.426 --> 23:22.533
though you turned them off, or else they wouldn't 
run when you turned them on. And eventually, we

23:24.596 --> 23:26.599
found that some contacts They're opening up in 
oil. You see, all the electrical system was in oil.

23:31.214 --> 23:33.337
So the relays were in oil, and they'd open up. And 
when they did this, they're opening up and pulling

23:34.278 --> 23:39.987
an arc and forming little carbon granules in 
between the relay points. Then this would either

23:41.269 --> 23:45.715
hold it open or partially short it out, and that's 
causing the problem. So all we did was turn them

23:45.735 --> 23:51.704
this way, so when they made those carbons, they 
dropped down to the bottom, and that solved the

23:45.735 --> 23:51.704
problem. That took us a long time. Then we lost 
Alvin one time down off Bermuda, and we had a fairly

23:54.862 --> 24:01.751
rudimentary navigation system. We could ping on 
them, and we could tell how far away they were from

24:02.793 --> 24:11.124
us by acoustics, but we didn't know which 
direction they really were. But when we were

24:11.845 --> 24:16.412
working on a slope, they would just tell us the 
depth of water where they were on. That drew a line

24:16.472 --> 24:24.042
for us, and then knowing how far away they were from 
us, knowing where we were, we could draw a line to

24:16.472 --> 24:24.042
tell us where they were. And we went in. We were out 
there, and we were just finishing a dive, and they

24:26.684 --> 24:29.368
were coming up. We got a measurement on them, and 
then we had to make up our mind whether we went this

24:30.329 --> 24:34.254
way or this way. And you change the range, and you 
know whether you're going the right way or not. We

24:38.560 --> 24:40.242
went this way, and the range got longer. So we went 
back this way, and we never heard them again. By

24:43.026 --> 24:46.731
that time, they'd come up through the water, and we 
couldn't hear them. And we didn't know where the

24:47.532 --> 24:48.914
heck they were. So we spent about eight or 10 hours 
before we finally found them. They shot some

24:56.594 --> 24:58.576
flares up. We got the Coast Guard planes that came 
out from Bermuda to start looking. They waited

25:02.741 --> 25:06.065
until it really got dark, and then they shot some 
flares up. And we saw them and went over and picked

25:06.125 --> 25:08.687
them up. And that was interesting. I bet it was. I 
bet it was interesting for them, too, by the way.

25:14.013 --> 25:14.253
Yeah, right. Yeah, they could see the lights of 
Bermuda and nothing else. We had trouble with the

25:18.738 --> 25:21.341
radio, though. The other thing that screwed us up 
there, antenna on their radio developed a crack,

25:23.219 --> 25:29.968
and it shorted it out, so they couldn't transmit 
back to us. And we were calling them, and they

25:30.488 --> 25:38.058
couldn't, they could just barely hear us calling 
them, but they couldn't get back on the air to tell

25:30.488 --> 25:38.058
us anything. So that was just another interesting 
day.

25:45.828 --> 25:49.873
We built, the mothership was an interesting, 
difficult problem to solve. We built Lulu

25:49.913 --> 25:51.775
eventually. We really didn't know what to do about 
Mothership, because nobody had really been

25:52.075 --> 25:58.581
handling the submarine this big before. And we 
found out that there were two of these big hulls

25:59.842 --> 26:05.468
down at New London. They'd been used in some mine 
towing, mine warfare experiments that were

26:05.488 --> 26:10.593
available. And they were about 100 feet long, 
elliptical shape, 9 feet high, and 14 feet wide,

26:10.633 --> 26:16.278
each hull. And we could get those, so we decided 
we'd build them. catamaran the way we do Lulu now

26:21.792 --> 26:51.597
there's a picture of it right there the way we do 
Alvin you see we pull her in between those two hulls

26:21.792 --> 26:51.597
then we have an elevator that's underneath her and 
picks her up so you can work on her so we designed

26:21.792 --> 26:51.597
that ship and built it and it was put together down 
here at the town dock as a matter of fact it was

26:21.792 --> 26:51.597
pretty casual in a good manner it's still working 
it's sitting out it's right out at the end of the

26:21.792 --> 26:51.597
dock today as a matter of fact It's been modified. 
It's changed. It looks different than it did in

26:55.121 --> 26:57.164
that picture. Somewhat now, it's got some bows on 
it and so on. But it's still basically the same

27:00.930 --> 27:06.558
halls that we put on.

27:06.578 --> 27:10.543
And the first year, we were very, it looked like a 
disaster. We didn't have the bridge or anything.

27:12.426 --> 27:17.213
We just had a, you know, we were just feeling our way 
along, playing it cool. So we got it running, and

27:18.855 --> 27:22.140
it's run quite well ever since, actually. When I 
became chairman of the geology and geophysics

27:23.977 --> 27:36.255
department, I gave up Alvin, and Scott Dobbin 
became its father, because it stayed in the

27:23.977 --> 27:36.255
applied oceanography department. Then I got it 
back again when I came back in 1971. That's

27:38.498 --> 27:42.564
been a lot of fun. Was there anything in the first 
series of tests you ran up on Alvin beside the

27:44.527 --> 27:52.498
flexibility of the hull which surprised you, or 
the strength of the hull? Not really. You didn't

27:54.484 --> 27:56.667
anticipate it all in turn? Everything seemed to be 
pretty well. It ran about the way we thought it

27:58.009 --> 28:00.972
would. Well, you know, a lot of engineering went 
into it. Bill Rainey was very important in it. Jim

28:08.742 --> 28:11.445
Maverick, everybody worked really hard on it. 
Arnold Chart. We had a lot of people working on it.

28:17.432 --> 28:19.515
Where did the oven go on its first voyage? Our first 
really working voyage, we went over and found the

28:21.301 --> 28:26.606
bomb in Palomares. That was the first time we ever, 
well, that's almost true. We tried to do some work

28:32.292 --> 28:41.881
off Bermuda the year before, but we didn't have 
that one problem 100% solved. So we came back. We

28:43.683 --> 28:47.106
felt we'd solved the problem in Palomares. guess 
it was 65, finally, when we were at Bermuda, and we

28:47.423 --> 28:57.136
came home, and we tore it down and looked at 
everything, and we were just putting it back

28:47.423 --> 28:57.136
together when the bomb happened. So that was the 
real first test of being, you know, thinking we

28:57.196 --> 29:04.866
were an operational submarine. And that was just 
hard work.

29:10.373 --> 29:16.080
What do you think has been the Alvin's 
contribution to, let's say, applied

29:10.373 --> 29:16.080
oceanography? Well, I've applied oceanography. 
I don't think it's done a great deal. It's done a lot

29:20.859 --> 29:27.267
more in geology, geophysics, and biology. We've 
done a few tasks, mostly for the Navy, that are

29:27.548 --> 29:39.103
applied tasks, going finding some things they've 
lost or looking at certain things for them. That's

29:39.123 --> 29:44.650
been a chore, a job, and it hasn't been really very 
exciting. I think the things they've done in the

29:45.642 --> 30:00.097
Mid-Atlantic Ridge, the famous work, anywhere 
along where they've gotten down into these

29:45.642 --> 30:00.097
canyons and really got much more of a feel for what 
the bottom of the ocean is like in a coherent

29:45.642 --> 30:00.097
manner. Even with photographs, it's difficult. 
Photographic technique has evolved very nicely

30:07.044 --> 30:10.688
in the last ten years. But to get down there and be 
able to look at the bottom and then selectively

30:11.444 --> 30:20.657
sample and see how the things relate to each other 
really tells you a lot more about the bottom than

30:11.444 --> 30:20.657
people ever knew before. The stuff they did in 
Famous has really been very interesting in terms

30:22.580 --> 30:29.710
of seafloor spreading and things like that. 
That's been the big thing. In biology, they've

30:30.631 --> 30:34.096
learned quite a bit. They've been able to do some 
experiments on the bottom that they weren't able

30:34.196 --> 30:37.941
to do before. And of course, set up a whole new 
venture of research for some people here, Holger

30:40.908 --> 30:51.584
Janisch, and looking at sort of the biological 
slowdown, the bacterial slowdown in depth. When

30:52.805 --> 31:03.561
Alvin was dropped

30:52.805 --> 31:03.561
in 68, I guess it was, she went to the bottom because 
a couple of cables broke. There were no people

31:04.302 --> 31:05.924
there, fortunately. And she stayed down there for 
nine months before she was recovered. And the

31:10.642 --> 31:18.293
sandwiches and apples that were in there looked 
very much like new sandwiches and apples when they

31:10.642 --> 31:18.293
came back up. There'd been very little bacteria 
action. So Holger Janischer has been really

31:21.337 --> 31:28.147
looking at that problem to a large extent as part of 
his work ever since. He's finding out some very

31:28.327 --> 31:30.270
interesting things.
