WEBVTT

00:14.493 --> 00:27.234
So

00:14.493 --> 00:27.234
this is clearly a case where international 
cooperation is highly desirable in a funny sort of

00:14.493 --> 00:27.234
way. That is, it's one facility, the Glomar 
Challenger, the only ship of its kind in the world.

00:35.707 --> 00:37.410
And it's very expensive to operate. And yet it can 
serve the interests of scientists from many

00:43.923 --> 00:46.786
different countries. Just exactly the opposite 
of the other justification I gave a few minutes

00:47.747 --> 00:57.078
ago, where you need facilities from many 
different countries to study one phenomenon.

00:57.939 --> 01:05.568
Here you have the possibility of studying many 
phenomena, which scientists from many different

00:57.939 --> 01:05.568
countries are interested in. But no one country, 
except the United States, feels that it can afford

01:06.589 --> 01:13.457
it. operate the equipment single-handed. And we 
welcome very much the financial participation

01:16.189 --> 01:25.942
and the scientific participation of people from 
other countries. So in both the justifications

01:25.982 --> 01:40.761
I've given, the cooperation is basically in terms 
of facilities, facilities belonging to

01:25.982 --> 01:40.761
different countries or facilities belonging to 
one country but used by many different countries.

01:46.500 --> 01:51.765
A third reason for international cooperation is 
to share results and ideas. And this is

01:53.207 --> 02:02.456
accomplished by various kinds of scientific

01:53.207 --> 02:02.456
unions or other organizations for that purpose. 
In the case of oceanography, as we said yesterday,

02:03.537 --> 02:09.803
oceanography is not really a science. a lot of 
different sciences doing research on an object of

02:10.475 --> 02:20.246
study, namely the ocean, namely that part of the 
earth which is covered in seawater.

02:22.789 --> 02:28.676
That is the air and the solid earth and the water 
itself and the critters that live in the water. And

02:31.219 --> 02:36.685
so there's no international union a disciplinary 
union that deals specifically with the ocean.

02:41.306 --> 02:48.255
There are lots of them, the physicists, the 
chemists, the biologists, the geologists, the

02:41.306 --> 02:48.255
geologists, and geophysicists. They're all 
interested in ocean science. So you need an

02:51.059 --> 03:00.150
organization which is orthogonal to the 
disciplinary unions, an object of study union.

03:00.170 --> 03:06.418
And that's furnished by the Scientific Committee 
on Oceanic Research, SCORE, which consists of

03:00.170 --> 03:06.418
representatives of the different unions. And in 
each union, there is one or more associations

03:07.816 --> 03:17.809
particularly concerned with the ocean, not in 
every union, but in three or four of them. For

03:17.829 --> 03:25.278
example, in the International Union of Geology 
and Geophysics, there's the Association of

03:17.829 --> 03:25.278
Physical Sciences of the Ocean. In the Union of 
Biological Sciences, there's the Association

03:26.660 --> 03:32.187
for Marine Biology. In the Union of Geological 
Sciences, a section or commission on marine

03:36.335 --> 03:45.124
geology, submarine geology, and so forth. And

03:45.164 --> 04:00.199
all these associations come together under the 
leadership of SCORE to have a joint oceanographic

03:45.164 --> 04:00.199
congress, an international oceanographic 
congress, every three or four years. The next one

04:00.219 --> 04:02.161
will be in Edinburgh this fall.

04:05.324 --> 04:06.325
There was one in Tokyo. two or three years ago, and 
before that one in Moscow. The first one was the one

04:10.187 --> 04:22.022
that you referred to, which was held at the United 
Nations headquarters in New York, called the

04:10.187 --> 04:22.022
First International Oceanographic Congress. 
And that was the one that was masterminded by Mary

04:22.142 --> 04:28.110
Sears, which I was the president of.

04:36.190 --> 04:45.241
I thought it was a tremendous occasion, and 
they're all very good occasions, these

04:36.190 --> 04:45.241
oceanographic congresses. They're the only way 
in which you can bring together people from all the

04:45.261 --> 05:02.181
various sciences that are connected with the 
ocean, that are interested in the ocean, to talk to

04:45.261 --> 05:02.181
each other about the ocean and not about their 
science, not about their particular discipline

04:45.261 --> 05:02.181
of science.

05:14.952 --> 05:25.490
And this also leads to another kind of 
cooperation, which is

05:14.952 --> 05:25.490
scientists working in each other's laboratories 
or on each other's ships.

05:29.477 --> 05:40.335
For example, on our mid-Pacific expedition, Anri 
Roche, my friend, who's now in New Caledonia, took

05:29.477 --> 05:40.335
part in that.

05:48.196 --> 05:56.426
You did set up this Soviet geophysicist I've been 
telling you about, and several of his associates

05:48.196 --> 05:56.426
have been out on our ships. We've been out on the 
Russian ships.

06:01.974 --> 06:07.741
And there's often exchange in the laboratory, 
too, when working out the results. These are very

06:07.781 --> 06:13.108
valuable learning experiences on both sides. 
They're mutually beneficial. I think that I would

06:18.655 --> 06:21.238
say several things about international 
cooperation. One is that it's darn difficult.

06:26.965 --> 06:31.411
Therefore, you don't want to do it unless you have 
to. It's more difficult on a worldwide basis than

06:31.571 --> 06:36.697
it is on a regional basis. Much easier cooperation 
between two countries is much easier than

06:36.717 --> 06:47.430
cooperation between three, and the difficulties 
go up exponentially as the number of countries

06:36.717 --> 06:47.430
increases.

06:49.739 --> 06:51.221
And the effectiveness goes down.

06:54.265 --> 06:55.606
In some cases, you have to have many countries.

06:59.031 --> 07:09.064
In my experience in oceanography,

06:59.031 --> 07:09.064
international cooperation never works unless 
the Americans take the lead.

07:13.229 --> 07:14.831
And there's several reasons for this. One reason 
is we've got so many scientists. one third of all

07:19.220 --> 07:25.267
the science in the world.

07:25.287 --> 07:35.419
The more important reason is that we're used to 
cooperation.

07:35.619 --> 07:37.482
We're kind of a league of nations. The United 
States all by itself is kind of a league of nations

07:38.403 --> 07:47.033
in the sense that it's so big and has so many 
institutions that have to learn how to cooperate

07:38.403 --> 07:47.033
with each other.

07:49.898 --> 07:56.644
And we have a tradition of what de Tocqueville 
called voluntary associations. Remember, de

07:56.664 --> 08:13.218
Tocqueville said that whenever two

07:56.664 --> 08:13.218
or more Americans have an objective, something 
that they want to accomplish, they form a

07:56.664 --> 08:13.218
voluntary association for every conceivable 
purpose. And we're in France to find the

08:14.479 --> 08:19.703
government taking the lead push different 
interests or different objectives. And in

08:25.941 --> 08:32.732
England, you'd find some aristocratic leader 
pushing an objective. In the United States, you

08:32.752 --> 08:36.197
have a voluntary association. These voluntary 
associations are

08:38.020 --> 08:46.753
ways in which we Americans learn how to get things 
done together. So we have a great advantage. in

08:49.518 --> 08:58.766
international scientific cooperation, simply 
because we've had a lot of experience thinking of

08:49.518 --> 08:58.766
ways to cooperate.

09:01.569 --> 09:10.256
In any case, I think the record would show that it 
works best when the Americans are very much

09:01.569 --> 09:10.256
involved. Now,

09:10.276 --> 09:17.803
one of the aspects of being very much involved is 
that we don't ever get out in front. I almost never

09:18.830 --> 09:26.220
find an American as a president of an association, 
an international cooperative enterprise. But

09:26.500 --> 09:28.863
you're very often finding a secretary.

09:35.231 --> 09:39.657
And this is part of the technique of doing the job.

09:43.028 --> 10:07.862
For example, the first secretary of the UNESCO 
Office of Oceanography was an American named

09:43.028 --> 10:07.862
Warren Wooster,

09:43.028 --> 10:07.862
who at that time was with Scripps,

09:43.028 --> 10:07.862
and later became director of the Rosenstiel 
Marine Laboratories at the University of Miami,

09:43.028 --> 10:07.862
and has now just gone to the University of 
Washington. He's probably the most talented

10:08.583 --> 10:11.888
scientific bureaucrat I've ever seen in my life. 
Remember I told him, I mentioned him yesterday, he

10:14.281 --> 10:17.365
had a great expedition. Just very good at getting, 
at administering big, big scientific

10:19.488 --> 10:28.999
enterprise.

10:29.019 --> 10:31.723
Then later he was the secretary and president of 
SCORE.

10:36.869 --> 10:39.733
And that's what really made SCORE work. His very 
great effectiveness is running it.

10:48.773 --> 10:59.744
But another aspect of scientific cooperation is 
that it just doesn't work if you let politics get

10:48.773 --> 10:59.744
involved in it. And this is what's unfortunately 
happened to the IOC, the Intergovernmental

10:59.764 --> 11:04.528
Oceanographic Commission. It's really been 
taken over by the diplomats.

11:09.833 --> 11:14.678
But its effectiveness is very, very low now. For 
the first 10 years, the delegates were

11:14.698 --> 11:18.662
scientists.

11:21.460 --> 11:30.815
The scientists had no trouble agreeing, but once 
you get the politicians into the act,

11:21.460 --> 11:30.815
everything slows down to a grinding halt.

11:38.547 --> 11:48.362
I wrote a paper, or I gave a paper about a year ago, 
which I called Ten Commandments for

11:38.547 --> 11:48.362
International Cooperation.

11:53.455 --> 12:05.187
I mean, and I thought I would tell you now some of 
these commandments.

12:05.207 --> 12:12.094
One other, there are several others, but they're 
all sort of second to the ones I've just stated.

12:12.114 --> 12:16.179
Like, for example, you really want to do a, you want 
to prepare for it. And no meeting really works

12:17.420 --> 12:23.226
unless you have a, have it in the right place, with 
the right people, carefully prepared agenda

12:25.248 --> 12:44.297
and careful attention to everything from housing 
to food to entertainment to the lack of

12:25.248 --> 12:44.297
distraction.

12:44.317 --> 12:51.728
For example, we had a very successful meeting 
organized by Warren Wooster on the island of Ponza

12:44.317 --> 12:51.728
off the Italian coast.

12:54.408 --> 13:07.603
And the reason it was successful was, A, it was a 
beautiful place, and, B, you couldn't do anything

12:54.408 --> 13:07.603
else but talk to the demography for four days, for a 
week, because there was nothing else there. Well,

13:07.623 --> 13:13.009
those are all sort of experience, details. 
Details learned by experience.

13:18.536 --> 13:22.120
So I'm proud of several things here, but basically 
I'm proud of the fact

13:23.855 --> 13:48.327
that many Americans, many American 
oceanographers

13:23.855 --> 13:48.327
now are enthusiastic about international 
society cooperation. Whereas to begin with, that

13:48.347 --> 13:51.972
was not the case.

13:55.580 --> 14:00.305
Now, what issues did you advise the Secretary of 
Interior on from 61 to 63? What issues? Why would

14:03.828 --> 14:08.873
you be attached to the Secretary of Interior's 
office in the sense of a special advisor? Well,

14:08.893 --> 14:14.399
that's a good question. The answer is not very 
simple.

14:22.226 --> 14:24.068
I was a good friend of Jerry Weasley. who was 
President Kennedy's science advisor. We've

14:30.189 --> 14:47.493
gotten to know each other through the Pugwash

14:30.189 --> 14:47.493
movement, and also in various other scientific

14:30.189 --> 14:47.493
.

14:51.919 --> 14:54.122
So when Kennedy came into office, Jerry became his 
special assistant for science and technology.

15:03.161 --> 15:09.149
He felt that every department should have what 
amounted to an assistant secretary for science

15:03.161 --> 15:09.149
and technology. And there was one already in the

15:11.071 --> 15:17.479
Navy, Jim Wakelin, one of these guys. By the way, 
the name of that coordinator for research and

15:17.920 --> 15:23.367
development was Fuhrer, F-U-H-R-E-R.

15:26.097 --> 15:33.708
He'd been an admiral through his staff and later 
became assistant secretary of the Navy for

15:26.097 --> 15:33.708
science and technology. And Jerry was able to get 
an assistant secretaryship established in the

15:33.728 --> 15:40.658
Department of Commerce for Holloman. He took that 
job.

15:45.645 --> 15:48.088
And in the Army and in the Air Force. And

15:48.128 --> 15:54.197
in the Some other departments, it was impossible 
to establish another assistant secretary, but

15:55.544 --> 16:19.610
they instead put in this Office of Science 
Advisory, which was true of HEW, and true of

15:55.544 --> 16:19.610
Interior, and true of State, the State 
Department.

16:19.630 --> 16:22.513
And I guess it was also more or less true

16:26.915 --> 16:33.802
Science advisor, it was a political appointment, 
but it didn't have to be confirmed by the Senate.

16:33.822 --> 16:35.343
The secretary himself could make it.

16:39.948 --> 16:44.493
Your title was special assistant to the 
secretary. Well, Stuart Udall didn't really want

16:44.513 --> 16:49.337
a science advisor. He didn't quite know what to do 
with one. But he didn't object. He thought it might

16:53.782 --> 16:56.905
be a good idea.

17:02.572 --> 17:27.769
Well,

17:02.572 --> 17:27.769
the Department of the Interior is a collection of 
baronets or dukedoms, the heads of which are each

17:02.572 --> 17:27.769
more powerful than the secretary, including the 
Geological Survey, the Bureau of Reclamation,

17:02.572 --> 17:27.769
the Bureau of Land Management, at that time Bureau 
of Commercial Fisheries and Sports Fisheries and

17:29.048 --> 17:53.487
Wildlife,

17:29.048 --> 17:53.487
the National Park Service,

17:29.048 --> 17:53.487
Bureau of Mines,

17:29.048 --> 17:53.487
and

17:29.048 --> 17:53.487
the various offices. And particularly the old 
line agencies like the Geological Survey and the

17:54.243 --> 18:08.636
Bureau of Reclamation had developed 
constituencies in Congress and in the states. So

18:09.557 --> 18:14.562
they had an enormous continuing strength. I 
remember very well Floyd Dominey, the

18:14.582 --> 18:21.128
Commissioner of Reclamation, the slippery 
character.

18:23.757 --> 18:29.985
very, really, you know, quite arrogantly 
powerful for a very good reason. You have the

18:30.045 --> 18:32.329
Congressman eating out of his hand. It's the 
undersecretary of a man named,

18:32.369 --> 18:43.864
when I was arrogant, it was Carr. I'm thinking 
about the one right after Carr. He was an Carter, I

18:51.027 --> 18:53.751
guess his name was Carter. He was an idealistic 
politician who

18:55.994 --> 19:08.972
took a really a dim view of dealing with the Bureau 
of Reclamation. Political plums and political

19:10.334 --> 19:17.845
punishment that they dealt out to congressmen, 
depending on what they supported them about. And

19:19.765 --> 19:22.829
they severely criticized Dominie one time. 
Dominie said, if you don't like what I'm doing, why

19:23.690 --> 19:29.638
don't you fire me? Well, the outshot was that a week 
later, Carter was out of a job as undersecretary.

19:39.591 --> 19:42.775
He was just, I mean, Dominie was just too powerful. 
So there was really very little to do for a science

19:42.795 --> 19:49.283
advisor to do in the Office of the Secretary of the 
Interior. I did some things. I

19:52.898 --> 19:58.767
had a very good assistant named Howard Echols.

20:01.931 --> 20:14.730
One of the things we did was to get a National 
Academy study of the National Park Service, which

20:01.931 --> 20:14.730
resulted in the firing of the director,

20:01.931 --> 20:14.730
which was a major coup in Stuart's cap, or 
Petterson's cap, major coup, just for this reason

20:15.031 --> 20:30.727
I've been outlining, that these guys all had their 
contention, including Conrad Worth, the

20:15.031 --> 20:30.727
director of the National Park Service. But it was 
clear from the National Academy study that the

20:32.669 --> 20:42.619
Park Service really was not doing a very good job. 
We had another study of of solar energy. Again, I

20:46.775 --> 20:54.463
got a National Academy committee to look into the 
possibilities for solar energy. Hubert Humphrey

20:54.503 --> 21:00.609
was pushing very hard for us to establish an office 
for solar energy. The trouble was he backed away

21:00.629 --> 21:05.654
from getting any congressional authorization or 
appropriation for it. He wanted us to do it on our

21:05.674 --> 21:06.935
own. And we had a study being put together

21:20.405 --> 21:27.152
spelled out, more or less, the possibilities for 
research and development of solar energy. At that

21:27.173 --> 21:29.695
time, they were rather dim. The reason was the 
price of oil and coal was so much lower than it is

21:31.097 --> 21:36.643
now. Now the prospects for solar energy are very 
much better. But

21:41.228 --> 21:50.158
they weren't very good when it was $3 a barrel, or $1 
a gallon.

21:53.446 --> 22:01.113
They don't look very good now, but they look an 
awful lot better.

22:01.133 --> 22:03.195
The other option was nuclear energy. It worries a 
lot of people.

22:09.300 --> 22:21.951
The other thing I did was to make a study of the 
charge of the study

22:09.300 --> 22:21.951
of a combination possibilities of combining 
nuclear electric power generation with salt

22:22.488 --> 22:29.798
water conversion.

22:33.243 --> 22:41.355
In other words, using the low temperature steam 
for evaporating seawater and high temperature

22:33.243 --> 22:41.355
steam for making electric power.

22:44.119 --> 22:49.086
I was chairman of the Federal Council of Science 
and Technology Committee on I was a member of the

22:50.753 --> 22:56.099
Federal Council for Science and Technology and 
chairman of their committee on water resources

22:50.753 --> 22:56.099
research. And we actually managed to get an office 
of water resources research established in the

22:57.301 --> 23:17.284
Department of Interior, which in turn supports

22:57.301 --> 23:17.284
institutions for water resources research in 
every state in the country. partly on a formula

23:19.475 --> 23:24.201
basis and partly on a research grant basis. We have 
one in Texas. Every state has one. This was a very

23:27.766 --> 23:35.115
difficult thing to do because every other 
department, half a dozen departments, are

23:27.766 --> 23:35.115
interested in water. And every department fights 
like a food tiger for its cognizance and its

23:36.557 --> 23:42.624
prerogatives. And the Agriculture Department 
and the Commerce Department

23:49.343 --> 23:51.525
and the Department of Defense.

23:55.189 --> 24:02.697
I

23:55.189 --> 24:02.697
guess that was all. None of them thought it was a 
good idea to give this job to Interior. They'd

24:09.144 --> 24:14.490
rather not have it done at all than have Interior do 
it, because it looked like it might interfere with

24:09.144 --> 24:14.490
their prerogative. But fortunately, Orville 
Freeman and Stuart Udall were good friends. And so

24:20.361 --> 24:23.844
the Agriculture Department finally agreed to it. 
And this was, the law was passed, and it was done.

24:28.129 --> 24:34.715
That was perhaps the most important long-range 
thing I did for the Department of the Interior. I

24:36.196 --> 24:41.862
tried to do something about the geological survey 
in particular.

24:43.073 --> 24:52.568
getting them to support more research in colleges 
and universities, following along the lines of

24:43.073 --> 24:52.568
ONR and NSF, never had any success. And they in 
general took a very dim view of the Secretary's

24:54.571 --> 25:03.445
office, let alone the science advisors. There was 
a guy named Tom Nolan who ran the survey Geological

25:09.145 --> 25:17.174
Survey people always appear at a meeting, a 
government meeting, and find themselves not

25:09.145 --> 25:17.174
Department of the Interior, but U.S. Geological 
Survey. They regard themselves as kind of a

25:17.194 --> 25:21.679
separate branch of the government. And that's 
true in general of these

25:21.700 --> 25:27.767
old-line agencies. My job was to work for Jerry 
Wiesman.

25:32.792 --> 25:34.454
And this really changed my career. It changed my 
whole life. I think, wait a second now, you better

25:38.103 --> 25:48.807
repeat that now for a second, because I think our 
tape had a 15-second delay.

25:48.827 --> 25:51.874
In the meantime, why don't we go to the bathroom? 
Okay.
