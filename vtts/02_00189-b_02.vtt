WEBVTT

00:03.625 --> 00:11.816
Were you representing an institution, a spirit, 
or anything as you were marching down the street?

00:20.489 --> 00:31.624
Now,

00:20.489 --> 00:31.624
of the four places, Which one did you enjoy most, 
the four core trip?

00:53.281 --> 00:59.086
Now, you marched down Main Street in Houston, 
Congress in Austin, and in Dallas, was it Elm or

00:53.281 --> 00:59.086
Main? Or do you remember?

01:06.147 --> 01:08.349
I'm assuming it was. I think it was commerce. Oh, 
really? Oh, okay. Didn't commerce one way that

01:12.033 --> 01:13.854
way? It's a bigger group. Well, it parallels. 
Yeah, it parallels the other two. Okay. I hadn't

01:19.440 --> 01:20.401
thought about that. Commerce. And all three were 
busy.

01:26.447 --> 01:31.431
I

01:26.447 --> 01:31.431
think that's commerce, yeah. I'm pretty sure. 
Yeah, Baker. I think the Baker was on that side and

01:33.314 --> 01:37.939
the office on this side. I hadn't thought of that. I 
apologize. Thank you. Do you have any special

01:43.626 --> 01:48.351
football game memories?

01:55.059 --> 01:56.781
I don't know. I'm not sure. I don't know. I don't 
know. I don't know. Where was that day?

02:04.192 --> 02:16.890
And

02:04.192 --> 02:16.890
what did you freshmen do to celebrate?

02:22.169 --> 02:28.257
.

02:28.277 --> 02:48.542
.

02:48.562 --> 02:48.582
.

02:53.354 --> 03:05.232
I remember like one, we had won one last year. We won 
one game. And we beat Georgia. That's the only

03:08.737 --> 03:15.447
game we won.

03:20.270 --> 03:29.485
Okay,

03:20.270 --> 03:29.485
we're getting now near the end of the serious ones. 
Final review and what did that, what were, what was

03:30.226 --> 03:36.816
it, where was it, what did it mean to you 
emotionally? Final review.

03:46.139 --> 04:07.183
I

03:46.139 --> 04:07.183
know you might want to review the previous year. 
The year that you go around the first time you've

04:07.203 --> 04:09.165
seen it, and the next time you go in and see it. 
That's actually the greatest thing you want to do.

04:10.207 --> 04:11.488
Also, the other thing I would say is take a look at 
the program.

04:18.050 --> 04:38.070
So,

04:18.050 --> 04:38.070
I really just can't watch them. I can't watch them. 
What

04:39.498 --> 05:02.603
did you get for

04:39.498 --> 05:02.603
the

04:39.498 --> 05:02.603
boots? Were the boots new to you or had you

05:02.623 --> 05:08.509
bought them? As

05:09.687 --> 05:30.536
you're

05:09.687 --> 05:30.536
preparing to leave the campus, what kind of a world 
did you think you were going into? Whatever it was,

05:30.556 --> 05:33.600
I thought I could come. I thought I was a failure. I 
thought I was a problem. That's what pulled me in.

05:38.286 --> 05:38.867
The whole world. No.

05:43.658 --> 05:47.624
I had no question. Did you already have a job by 
commissary? Yes, I did. With

05:52.851 --> 05:59.160
Michael and the children. I had $416 million. I 
knew it was going to be for children. How

06:01.375 --> 06:31.197
did,

06:01.375 --> 06:31.197
what role

06:01.375 --> 06:31.197
did A&M play in helping you make those contacts? 
Oh, let me tell you, I

06:31.379 --> 06:40.961
didn't have to. I hardly had to interview. At that 
point, they were so pleased with me. I know it was

06:49.299 --> 06:50.502
just almost. I didn't hire any graduates. That's 
not true of many other students. Look from the back

06:56.076 --> 06:58.438
there. But I know many other people that had so many 
friends in one of the tribes that didn't matter.

07:07.088 --> 07:12.635
But it was almost, and I had worked for them a summer 
prior to that. I think I mentioned that I had to be

07:13.816 --> 07:20.524
part of the patrolling community curriculum. I 
have to have one. How'd you

07:21.515 --> 07:34.453
feel when you got that Aggie ring? Oh yeah, no, but I 
mean when that time?

07:46.237 --> 07:46.557
No way. I wear it off campus, you know, at home. 
Yeah, OK. But it takes 100 and something hours,

07:50.262 --> 07:55.007
because I had that. Most of the engineering 
students had it at the, I think I had it at the end of

07:55.208 --> 08:04.178
my junior year. I can't think of it. Was there any 
kind of a ritual that you and your buddies did when

08:06.801 --> 08:14.370
you first bought the ring?

08:15.515 --> 08:17.677
Did you put it in any kind of a liquid? Oh, well, soul 
dressing. Huh? Soul dressing. Soul dressing.

08:25.646 --> 08:26.647
What, the soul dressing? You put on the soul 
dressing. You put, you whacking it in with the soul

08:28.870 --> 08:31.193
dressing. You take a flesh cloth and you wipe it 
off. But you didn't put it in a pitcher of alcoholic

08:33.816 --> 08:38.361
beverage?

08:42.285 --> 08:44.027
No, no, I didn't. It wasn't that strong. Because 
I've heard that some did. Oh, I can believe that.

08:48.540 --> 08:51.402
And I've heard that a few even got it in their mouth 
and almost swallowed it. Oh, my God. What has it

08:53.785 --> 08:55.146
meant to wear that ring?

08:58.989 --> 09:06.697
I think you

08:58.989 --> 09:06.697
know the answer before I say it. I've never

09:06.717 --> 09:12.382
gone anywhere without it. I certainly wouldn't go 
anywhere. See, there are only a few schools today

09:14.459 --> 09:22.651
that pay any attention to rings. The few Ivy 
Leagues, the academies, and then a few other

09:23.993 --> 09:32.005
separate land grants. Clemson, I think maybe 
Auburn, but that's about it. And senior rings are

09:37.734 --> 09:40.698
pretty well gone almost everywhere else. 
Aggieland is one of a few. yearbook still going.

09:45.414 --> 09:58.835
One of my friends up in Missouri, a fellow named 
Don, oh yeah, a fellow named Don Walsworth, he's

09:45.414 --> 09:58.835
the owner of an old family printing operation in a 
teeny little town named Marceline. And a couple

09:58.855 --> 10:02.281
years ago I ran into him, I said, hey Don, how's 
business going? He said, I just got a contract for

10:02.301 --> 10:05.526
the biggest yearbook in America going to print it. 
And I said, well, how'd you get the A&M contract? He

10:09.672 --> 10:10.632
said, how would you know? I said, well, it's just a 
random guess when you said the biggest. Just a

10:13.715 --> 10:14.916
random guess. And he was saying, oh, he said, not 
only is it big in thickness, he said it's big in

10:14.936 --> 10:21.502
number of copies. And I said, well, they're so 
square and so old fashioned, they believe that

10:22.303 --> 10:27.828
having a yearbook still is good. OK, now we're to 
the real hot. What are the contributing factors

10:35.392 --> 10:43.079
that make up Aggie spirit?

10:45.021 --> 10:50.466
Where does

10:45.021 --> 10:50.466
it come from? Where does it come from? All of what 
I'm saying is that you have to explain it to

10:52.047 --> 10:56.392
someone. And you have to guess whether or not you 
have it coming on them. And there's problems under

11:01.476 --> 11:02.277
there. I probably

11:03.202 --> 11:11.102
ought to go a little bit different.

11:15.875 --> 11:43.687
And

11:15.875 --> 11:43.687
I guess when you see, as you mentioned, something 
like Ed Davis and Clayton Williams, what I think

11:15.875 --> 11:43.687
about that experience is that you go in to Clayton 
Williams and get $2 million. He thinks just over

11:43.707 --> 11:44.287
and over. He breaks out in tears. All right, were 
there some events when you were a student that are

11:45.642 --> 11:54.236
part of that?

11:54.256 --> 11:57.101
Let's hear it. Well,

11:57.221 --> 12:12.426
I

11:57.221 --> 12:12.426
think, there again, I think, I think, uh, I think 
some of the towns, uh, uh, muster the student

11:57.221 --> 12:12.426
songs, uh, which are always absolutely 
marvellous.

12:15.798 --> 12:41.215
Oh,

12:15.798 --> 12:41.215
okay.

12:47.945 --> 13:03.688
I spoke

12:47.945 --> 13:03.688
for about five minutes or so at a muster

12:47.945 --> 13:03.688
that we had in France this year. I know you tripped 
an ollie, but it was pretty cool. And before it was

13:06.692 --> 13:10.678
over, we had a gal there that was helping with the 
group. She was married to a Frenchman who was

13:10.698 --> 13:13.362
living in France. She was a tear. And it's... It's a 
pretty solid thing. And then we ended up, we called

13:21.391 --> 13:33.250
out the names of several people very close to the 
association like Bud Meyers and Juanita. They've

13:33.270 --> 13:36.295
been the traitor for years and I think maybe one of 
them.

13:40.021 --> 13:50.354
I

13:40.021 --> 13:50.354
don't know if I really answered your question. I 
don't think I did. All right. But it's one that you

13:53.658 --> 13:55.179
can't completely answer. And you're going to be 
looking for an answer for it for always.

14:01.387 --> 14:01.587
All right. The last question. What feelings do you 
hold in your heart for a man? Let's see. I

14:04.270 --> 14:09.657
wouldn't be where I am today without it.

14:57.207 --> 15:07.425
Have it gone

14:57.207 --> 15:07.425
somewhere else. I think the education, the

15:08.907 --> 15:20.767
leadership. Mr. Berry?

15:24.460 --> 15:36.698
The fact that you can still go back

15:24.460 --> 15:36.698
on campus and it really hasn't changed that much, 
even though it's huge. I think the main thing that

15:36.718 --> 15:47.273
we want to do is try to keep it

15:36.718 --> 15:47.273
so that we still have the same feeling. And so 
it's...

15:54.430 --> 16:17.161
underprivileged

15:54.430 --> 16:17.161
people will still

15:54.430 --> 16:17.161
be able to go there and get

15:54.430 --> 16:17.161
the

15:54.430 --> 16:17.161
same kind of education. It doesn't really matter 
what the race is.

16:21.633 --> 16:25.739
so much that it gives you. And it just keeps on 
giving.

16:32.169 --> 16:36.235
It's hard to really repay it or give back enough.

16:41.843 --> 16:44.166
You want to quit with that? That's a great ending. 
And I thank you, thank you, thank you.
