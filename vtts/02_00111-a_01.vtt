00:02.377 --> 00:04.961
Nice bright day in College Station. Had the 
pleasure of chatting with Harrison Hurth, fellow

00:06.063 --> 00:24.211
Presbyterian, and a dear friend about his 
experiences here at College Station.

00:24.231 --> 00:29.599
This is February 15, 1999, a bright sunny day. Have 
the pleasure and honor of chatting with Harrison

00:30.170 --> 00:32.634
Hurth. Before we start talking about A&M, so that 
anyone in the future might know a little bit about

00:34.436 --> 00:49.919
your background before A&M, give us a brief 
biographical summary of your experience before

00:34.436 --> 00:49.919
coming to College Station. Okay. Well, I was born 
in Pontiac, Illinois, and I lived there through

00:50.780 --> 00:54.726
high school. I went to undergraduate school at 
Illinois Western University in Bloomington,

00:55.212 --> 01:09.971
Illinois, where I met my

00:55.212 --> 01:09.971
wife, Margaret Rowland, and married her in 1938. I 
went then to the University of Illinois for a

01:09.991 --> 01:19.383
master's degree, and I taught for a number of years 
in Illinois high school. It's in Clinton,

01:19.403 --> 01:22.587
Illinois. I came to A&M when the University of 
Illinois placement office sent me a notice that

01:23.360 --> 01:33.932
A&M wanted some teachers for summer school. That 
didn't sound like a summer resort, and I thought,

01:34.693 --> 01:41.640
well, that's a chance to give the collegiate level 
a shot. So I applied. What year was that? That was

01:44.864 --> 01:45.725
1946. And Dr. Thomas Mayo replied and said he 
didn't meet anyone after all, He probably would be

01:52.537 --> 02:02.830
contacting me in the fall, but maybe not quite that 
strong, but something between a possibility and a

01:52.537 --> 02:02.830
polite brush off. And I think on the Fourth of July 
weekend, I was visiting some friends in Western

02:03.591 --> 02:19.111
Illinois, and he had called me prior to that, and I 
talked it over with him, and he crashed around. He

02:19.191 --> 02:20.653
had made me an offer. So I called on that weekend, 
and I arrived a week late in September 1946.

02:31.470 --> 02:35.696
My younger daughter had just been born and was not 
really doing too well. Margaret was still in the

02:35.776 --> 02:37.859
hospital. I came down alone, and someone had been 
covering for me for a week or so. I'd be interested,

02:43.527 --> 02:45.590
you came by car? Came by car. And what, how much gear 
did you bring in that car? Well, what I had was a 1938

02:52.932 --> 03:02.605
Chevrolet Coupe. They didn't have a very big 
truck, but I obviously bought enough stuff to

03:02.625 --> 03:17.584
survive because I had enough clothing to last 
until Thanksgiving, when I got my wife at

03:02.625 --> 03:17.584
Thanksgiving time. And then y'all drove by. Was 
that your only car? Yeah, what happened this time,

03:23.864 --> 03:32.035
the relative drove Margaret and her mother to 
Memphis. I went to Memphis on the train, and we

03:32.376 --> 03:39.766
drove back then in her mother's car. And where were 
you all living then? Well, we lived out to A&M

03:41.728 --> 03:44.712
Annex. The University College had taken over 
Lowe-Bine Air Base and turned it into the A&M

03:44.732 --> 03:51.762
Annex. We had an apartment in what had been an 
officer's ward in the hospital. That scared me. I

03:58.773 --> 04:02.061
was going to bring a new baby down. I spent every 
evening with an old Dutch cleanser scrubbing down

04:02.081 --> 04:10.020
the walls. We had a large room big enough for a 
square dance in front, which we did not use in the

04:10.372 --> 04:19.946
apartment behind it. We had, I don't know, four or 
five radiators, two or three commodes. And was

04:27.216 --> 04:29.179
this furnished? Yes. What kind of furniture was in 
it? Well, no I'm sorry, it was not furnished.

04:37.751 --> 04:38.893
That's another story. We did burn our furniture. 
And when the furniture truck drove up, the driver

04:42.091 --> 04:52.063
demanded $700, which I hadn't counted. A lot of 
money then. I didn't have $700. So I hot-footed it

04:56.268 --> 05:02.716
into the First National Bank and talked to Travis 
Bryant. Got $700 and have banked with him ever

05:02.736 --> 05:07.001
since. I can imagine how that would be important. 
That air base experience, I think, is very, very

05:13.754 --> 05:18.059
important. That story about what was the 
enrollment and the out there and the faculty. How

05:26.329 --> 05:27.471
many folks were there? Well, 1946 was the year the 
veterans came. And the enrollment of the college

05:34.380 --> 05:37.163
virtually doubled. Yes, probably the total 
moment must have been in the area of 7,000. And they

05:43.677 --> 05:47.140
put a freshman class. All freshmen? All freshmen. 
What would that

05:50.864 --> 05:56.749
be? And some of those were veterans and some were 
not. Is that right? I'm not sure whether veterans

06:02.595 --> 06:05.277
went to the annex or not. I'm really not sure. All 
right, so you're implying that most of them- Most

06:09.397 --> 06:13.862
of them are- Right out of high school. Right out of 
high school, yeah. They had the whole setup. They

06:18.207 --> 06:21.871
had military personnel out there to have a core. 
They set up a campus post office. They had a

06:24.874 --> 06:29.719
student center. Dr. Harrington and John Paul 
Abbott at different times, whatever the title

06:29.739 --> 06:37.508
was, I believe they called them deans. and 
directed the operation. And you offered the full

06:41.911 --> 06:46.156
range of courses for freshmen.

06:48.920 --> 06:53.626
Did any of them come into the main campus to take any 
courses? I don't believe so. Our faculty people

06:56.309 --> 07:01.215
taught both classes. I taught mostly on the main 
campus, actually. And those of us who did carpool,

07:08.065 --> 07:16.818
And I had a semester or two when I taught a couple of 
days at the annex and three other times. Describe

07:16.838 --> 07:22.626
the students and their capability. Well, I dealt 
largely with the veterans. I did teach freshman at

07:26.732 --> 07:31.839
the annex, as I said, a couple days a week, a 
semester or two. But I dealt very largely with the

07:32.240 --> 07:35.344
veterans. And of course, they were excellent 
students. Do you remember

07:38.778 --> 07:50.942
any anecdotes or examples of that purpose and 
determination on their part?

07:54.549 --> 07:59.318
Any of them ever say anything or do anything that 
illustrated that?

08:02.858 --> 08:11.170
One thing that surprised me, quite a few of those 
fellows went into the Cold War. I would have

08:11.190 --> 08:19.802
thought, you know, that they had all the military 
they wanted, but a very precise number of them went

08:11.190 --> 08:19.802
into the Cold War. And their academic performance 
was very good. Were there instances when you could

08:26.172 --> 08:32.781
sense that the experience of where they'd been and 
what they'd seen helped them to understand

08:33.098 --> 08:40.328
something that you were trying to teach them?

08:40.348 --> 08:45.415
Well, I'm sure that happened, but I really don't 
remember any specifics. Obviously, we knew they

08:45.435 --> 08:48.439
were around. What was your teaching load? What 
courses and how many? We taught 18 hours, for

08:51.944 --> 08:56.170
goodness sake. Freshman composition, of course, 
and the sophomore literature

08:56.538 --> 09:05.251
course. I took that, I taught that, I taught a shift 
for the course. About what was the enrollment per

09:08.316 --> 09:10.299
section?

09:14.806 --> 09:17.169
I guess it was pretty close to 30. But no big 
sections? No big sections. No, I don't think there

09:21.456 --> 09:22.157
were. And you gave them the same kind of 
assignments and homework that you would have any

09:23.099 --> 09:30.487
other classes? Pretty much. What about their 
attendance? Is it regular?

09:41.699 --> 09:41.939
Regular. Let's go back to the air base. There are 
many hundreds of students out there. and almost

09:50.082 --> 10:10.420
all of their activities were out there i know 
that's when the fish drill team was created and i

09:50.082 --> 10:10.420
understand there was a freshman band what 
interaction was there between the main campus of

09:50.082 --> 10:10.420
the students and the air base well actually uh

10:13.842 --> 10:17.027
Well, they went to town on weekends and all that 
kind of thing. Actually, it wasn't all that much. I

10:18.449 --> 10:26.601
think the sophomores were very unhappy that they 
weren't getting out the freshmen as they might

10:18.449 --> 10:26.601
have liked. Well, was there any hazing out there? 
No. Because there were only freshmen? Only

10:32.630 --> 10:34.113
freshmen. Now, about how many of you faculty lived 
out there?

10:45.533 --> 10:53.421
Well, let's

10:45.533 --> 10:53.421
see. There must have been 30 or 40 families. There 
was a housing area near the entrance called The

10:57.725 --> 11:04.032
Village, and a group lived up there. And the rest of 
us were in barracks apartments. And I don't know if

11:08.916 --> 11:12.520
you know these people or not. the Lee Martins and 
the Staley Cresswells and the Ed Holdridges and

11:12.803 --> 11:19.651
the C.K. Estins and the Vance Sumner in economics.

11:26.640 --> 11:35.831
Vance and I put out a garden together one spring and 
I started digging first and I did cut one end of it.

11:35.851 --> 11:39.435
Vance showed up one day and said, now's the time to 
start our garden. I'll take this. So I had

11:40.997 --> 11:46.865
to dig up the other end. And you did garden. Did many 
others garden out there? Yeah, there were several

11:52.613 --> 11:54.416
gardens. We had a pretty nice life out there, 
really. We had a swimming pool. We had a baseball

12:00.084 --> 12:02.508
diamond. We were working. I just wanted to be sure 
it was turning. Yeah. We... had all those miles of

12:08.643 --> 12:12.669
barracks for the kids to go skate in. Great place 
for kids. Was there any hazing of the freshmen? I

12:17.696 --> 12:18.458
don't think so. Because there were no sophomores. 
No sophomores there, no. But they were organized

12:22.003 --> 12:25.268
in military fashion. They ate together. Not many 
of them had cars. That's true. Yeah, I remember

12:34.081 --> 12:35.663
that mess all night. They kidded me. I came down 
here from Illinois, and one of the first meals we

12:37.203 --> 12:46.634
had, I said, you know, I don't like beans, but these 
are the best beans I ever ate. Black-eyed peas.

12:48.996 --> 12:53.101
Never heard of

12:48.996 --> 12:53.101
them. So you all dined in the old base mess hall. Did 
you faculty members eat in the dining hall, or did

12:58.947 --> 13:05.194
you eat on your own at home? Well, I ate in the dining 
hall until I got my family. And most people did.

13:14.584 --> 13:22.311
Describe the faculty social life between you 
faculty families that were out there. Well, there

13:22.331 --> 13:29.618
was an article in the paper not too long ago that you 
might have seen about my wife and her bridge club.

13:29.638 --> 13:34.523
They organized a bridge club out there that's 
still going. and got together and played cards and

13:35.077 --> 13:42.547
we played some softball with the garden and swam. 
We didn't really have, well we might have used the

13:42.567 --> 13:53.863
student center, actually didn't have much of a 
place to get together as a group. We got very close

13:53.883 --> 13:57.428
as neighbors. The, and you said that Dr. 
Harrington and or John Paul were

14:04.979 --> 14:11.831
administratively responsible for? Yes, at 
different times. Dr. Harrington started and at

14:13.695 --> 14:19.144
some point he moved on to John Paul Abbott. Now did 
that have, what was the official title of that

14:20.627 --> 14:26.177
unit? Was it Texas A&M? Oh, the whole unit. Texas 
A&M Annex. Annex, okay. And you were out there how

14:36.484 --> 14:38.546
long? Four years. Four? Oh, I didn't know it was 
that long. We moved, well, three actually. We

14:45.856 --> 14:48.960
moved here and actually four now. And most others 
stayed one more year. So then that lasted from...

14:57.038 --> 14:58.379
46 to 50. 46 to 50, the interim period between World 
War II and Vietnam. I mean, and Korean War. Right.

15:05.987 --> 15:07.328
And the Korean War. Back to, what was your 
beginning faculty salary? I believe it was

15:13.735 --> 15:15.396
$2,250. For nine months.

15:20.802 --> 15:24.345
Well, actually, most of us got one and a half. Well, 
but I'm assuming that was the base. Yeah, that was

15:26.706 --> 15:27.847
nine months. And

15:27.948 --> 15:35.216
you and your wife had two daughters at that point. 
Was there an elementary school out there for those

15:35.997 --> 15:41.623
that were school age? Well, our older daughter was 
school age, and she went to some advanced school.

15:47.550 --> 15:47.690
Oh! Little country school. Little country 
school. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And it started there in

15:51.835 --> 15:53.877
the first grade. And she came home one day

15:54.228 --> 16:07.965
and said, I know the first grade boys, the second 
grade boys, those third grade boys are hard. Came

16:07.985 --> 16:14.494
back crying one day, said she had to show us her 
report card. My A has it marked black, nobody else

16:14.514 --> 16:17.097
had it. Oh, it was a plus. Uh-oh, I was going to say. 
She was there, I think, two years and then went to

16:20.478 --> 16:24.023
Bowie School. All right, as you look back on it, how 
did those two years, were those good years for her?

16:32.873 --> 16:33.213
Yes.

16:36.537 --> 16:44.326
She had a splendid teacher, one she loved, and they 
were good years. All right, so you taught out

16:44.346 --> 16:46.729
there. Three years. Then you moved to this house? 
Yes. And that's 1949. And what's the address of

16:55.856 --> 16:57.758
this house? 208 Fairview Avenue. Okay. Describe 
the neighborhood when you all moved in. What was

17:04.326 --> 17:05.548
Southside like? Well, really, it was pretty bare.

17:12.977 --> 17:16.682
This house was built by a lady in extension named 
Jenny Camp. She built this house with two plugs

17:17.168 --> 17:23.655
next door and one across the corner. And this was a 
prayer ring. Some of the men in the extension

17:28.481 --> 17:35.068
thought she was going to lose her shirt, so they 
formed a committee to try to get this away. But Miss

17:35.088 --> 17:40.013
Jenny went ahead and did all right. Then, I don't 
know much about this, but shortly thereafter,

17:40.033 --> 17:46.821
there was a group of faculty people I'm not even 
sure who they were, but they formed what they

17:47.813 --> 18:01.990
called the corporation and they built the good 
money houses on the streets and they began to fill

17:47.813 --> 18:01.990
in for the trees. Were there any native trees on 
these blocks?

18:10.981 --> 18:14.445
We have a native juju tree. And this area is, am I 
correct, that it was called Southside or

18:15.725 --> 18:21.253
Southgate?

18:25.378 --> 18:26.400
College Park. College Park. Oh, okay. Were there 
some older houses east of us, just south of what

18:29.083 --> 18:34.731
used to be called Jersey?

18:38.256 --> 18:38.576
Yes. All right. You all move here. The girls grow up 
here, your two daughters. And you then, did you

18:46.218 --> 18:55.737
teach a fourth year out at the Air Base, or did you 
start teaching full-time here on the campus that

18:46.218 --> 18:55.737
fourth year? I began teaching full-time. About 
how big was the English department in numbers of

18:58.903 --> 19:04.113
faculty? Oh, they had hired a good many. Motley 
Crue also, because of the influx of veterans. I

19:14.936 --> 19:18.179
suppose we had 50 maybe. Who were, let's try to 
recall as many of those as you can, who were some of

19:18.199 --> 19:28.890
the senior English faculty when you arrived? 
Well, Dr. Mayo headed the department, Dr. Morgan

19:30.913 --> 19:37.960
was here, Dr. Abbott, John Paul Abbott. Ernest 
Hitchcock.

19:48.326 --> 19:52.312
Nolan Shepard.

19:52.332 --> 19:53.314
Bird Price.

19:57.900 --> 19:58.702
All right, let's go back. Louis Hauer. Louis 
Hauer. Let's go back. Describe Dr. Mayo for

20:01.746 --> 20:06.613
someone that may never have met him. Well he's a 
very charming man. Very lively and articulate and

20:11.459 --> 20:17.588
learned and cordial. He just exuded charm. He was a 
great conversationalist. He couldn't bear a

20:21.914 --> 20:24.918
moment of silence. Now he was the department head? 
Yes, he had been moved over from the library. He had

20:29.945 --> 20:35.773
been a librarian and I think really that was his 
first love.

20:39.010 --> 20:42.713
And y'all, the department office in the academic 
building? In the academic building. Which

20:46.637 --> 20:48.939
floors? Third. Third. How many floors are there? 
We were just below the architects. All right, they

20:53.142 --> 20:57.266
were on the, I think they're the fourth or the 
fifth, whatever it is. Yeah, so we were on the floor

20:57.286 --> 20:59.728
below them, whatever that was. I remember later 
when I was going over every night trying to write a

21:00.449 --> 21:08.916
dissertation, my wife would worry about me, and I 
said, go over there and load the office up. Never

21:09.520 --> 21:10.321
alone. Let's see.

21:15.286 --> 21:16.907
Dr. Abbott. Describe him. Very dapper. Very 
dapper little fellow. I think the students called

21:24.115 --> 21:28.159
him Jelly Abbott.

21:35.186 --> 21:36.928
Now he became a dean, didn't he? Yes. He did. He 
served as the dean of liberal arts briefly. He

21:44.241 --> 21:47.284
spent one year on the court. And then he became a 
distinguished professor. What was his

21:50.367 --> 21:51.148
specialty?

21:54.712 --> 21:55.773
Well, no, it's strange. I don't think he ever 
published. Oh, okay. Let's see, did Dr. Mayo have a

22:01.319 --> 22:05.684
nickname? Did students give him a nickname? If he 
did, I didn't. I never knew him. Dr. Morgan, let's

22:09.899 --> 22:11.441
go to him. Yeah, Bloody. Bloody Morgan. Bloody 
Morgan. And he would later be department head,

22:15.066 --> 22:17.589
wouldn't he? Yes, he was. Describe him. Well, he 
was short, stocky, bald-headed, a bit dogmatic,

22:21.233 --> 22:37.594
pretty much knew it all, excellent golfer, and 
played baseball at Ohio State, I believe, had a big

22:38.603 --> 22:45.871
league tryout, which didn't materialize. At 
least he had the tryout.

22:50.116 --> 22:56.003
He described himself as a scholar with, he said, a 
foul man's body. Now, not many of those senior

22:58.065 --> 23:02.991
colleagues were Texans, were they? It all came 
from a wide variety of... John Paul was from

23:05.468 --> 23:12.556
Tennessee.

23:17.061 --> 23:18.823
What's the university in Nashville? Vanderbilt. 
Vanderbilt. Hedgecock was in Tennessee.

23:25.350 --> 23:25.791
Mayo? Yeah, through Mayo. I really don't know. I'm 
not sure I know. Because... In some of the other

23:32.587 --> 23:36.871
areas, I know there were lots of Aggies. And you 
started working on your doctoral degree when?

23:42.136 --> 23:42.557
1950s. 50. I was in Wisconsin in 53 and 54. So you 
took leave? Took leave, yeah. And did you take wife

23:49.604 --> 23:51.726
and daughters with you? Oh, yes, I did. And the 
housing was tight at the University of Wisconsin.

23:58.412 --> 24:02.256
And we lived in a trailer just across from the field 
house, actually, and the stadium, is it called?

24:13.816 --> 24:14.938
I'll think, maybe I'll think of it. I can't think 
what the, what that trailer area was called.

24:17.782 --> 24:19.884
Something Park, I believe. And anyhow, we had a 
trailer with an oil heater for heat, no running

24:19.904 --> 24:25.712
water. all the water and bathhouses. Actually, we 
were comfortable. They had the thing organized.

24:34.807 --> 24:36.394
They had a We were all graduate students. They had a 
body that took charge of the thing, and we had to get

24:38.609 --> 24:47.922
permission to get a larger trailer and bring our 
father and daughter. We went up with our younger

24:47.942 --> 24:58.857
daughter only, leaving our older daughter, Mary 
Margaret, in the school in Lexington, Illinois

24:47.942 --> 24:58.857
with her grandmother until we could. They gave us 
permission to get a bigger trailer. We were on the

25:02.682 --> 25:04.444
right side of town. They went to the best schools in 
the city. Mary Margaret took West Isaac. We'd

25:11.852 --> 25:16.397
forgotten the elementary school.

25:16.417 --> 25:19.420
They were on the right side of town. We were 
actually very comfortable. The kids would go down

25:22.884 --> 25:28.049
the night that Margaret worked to help put me 
through. Actually, she worked for the Wisconsin

25:28.129 --> 25:30.512
General Hospital. And she worked nights as a 
nurse's aide. And I was along with the kids. Well,

25:36.025 --> 25:39.889
the girls would go down to the bathhouse, take 
their shower. They'd hide in stalls and listen to

25:40.110 --> 25:45.756
the young ladies talk about their babies and 
whatnot. I frequently had to go rust out some woman

25:45.776 --> 25:49.920
to go down and get them out. Now, did A&M give you a 
leave of absence? Yes. So you knew you had a slot

25:55.626 --> 25:57.448
coming back. Yes. And the... You funded all of this 
entirely yourself? Yes, we had saved, and we

26:04.190 --> 26:13.945
rented the house, and we had the same record, but we 
spent too long to make it. I got a letter from Travis

26:13.965 --> 26:17.230
Bryan when I was there. You couldn't believe I'd 
been there that long, didn't need some money. He

26:21.536 --> 26:23.760
wrote me this dear friend Harrison letter. I can't 
quote it anymore, but it was in his famous style.

26:29.842 --> 26:48.762
Right, and

26:29.842 --> 26:48.762
then you came back then and finished your 
dissertation a little later, and your special

26:29.842 --> 26:48.762
area was what? And I, yes, I finished all the 
coursework and passed my qualifying

26:49.248 --> 26:57.717
and all that stuff. And came back and wrote the 
dissertation. Went back to my office every night

27:00.620 --> 27:04.605
and wrote it. Came home one night, wondered, how 
many pages did you write? I said, I didn't write

27:09.170 --> 27:13.655
any, and I sadly bought it. She didn't approve of 
that. All right, during the 50s,

27:19.032 --> 27:26.122
what were the changes here at A&M? During what? 
During the 50s. Oh. What were the changes here at

27:28.385 --> 27:30.328
A&M? The moment goes down a little as the veterans 
go on. Not one thing. Well, one thing I remember

27:38.019 --> 27:45.850
from that time, the computers came along. We had 
our first computer center somewhere in the early

27:47.399 --> 27:51.483
50s. And the first study done on the thing was one by 
Charlie Hagelman, who was head of Lamar. I

28:03.396 --> 28:08.081
remember the subject, but that's his first name. 
And then Milton Huggins did a concordance to the

28:08.101 --> 28:16.090
Book of Common Prayer, and a student, When

28:16.964 --> 28:45.098
y'all come back, the students, generalize about 
the students and what their interests were in the

28:16.964 --> 28:45.098
50s.

28:49.195 --> 28:58.964
Were there many English majors, many social 
sciences, humanities students at A&M then? Not

28:58.984 --> 28:59.165
many. I don't know how many majors. Yeah, we did 
that. The typical student taking one of your

29:02.788 --> 29:07.993
advanced courses, taking it as an elective?

29:11.296 --> 29:13.679
We had some who did that. Those who did were good 
students. Do you recall any pranks or jokes or

29:18.659 --> 29:30.096
incidents in classes where the students figured 
out some kind of something or other? Anybody ever

29:30.136 --> 29:34.783
pull one off in class on you?

29:41.673 --> 29:42.314
Very likely. I don't really know. All right. Now, 
your nickname, I understand, was Happy. Yeah, I

29:48.275 --> 29:52.802
think I discovered they called me Happy Harry. Do 
you know when you discovered that? I

29:55.726 --> 29:59.151
don't know. I don't remember how I found it out. 
Now, let's stay with these nicknames a little. Mr.

30:04.479 --> 30:05.981
Coffers, D.B. Coffers. Dusty Butt. Dusty Butt. 
Bloody Morgan. Bloody Morgan. Did Huggett have a

30:12.110 --> 30:13.772
nickname? I don't believe so. If so, I didn't know 
it. Any others you remember in English or anywhere

30:17.283 --> 30:22.091
else?

30:27.179 --> 30:29.883
Well, elsewhere, of course, Square Root Jackson. 
Mm-hmm. And Alphabet Thompson. Dr. Dan the Grade

30:35.793 --> 30:38.257
Point Man.

30:43.486 --> 30:43.746
All right. Oh, Jock Woods. Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

30:53.522 --> 30:57.967
OK, now I anoint you as a philosopher. What did 
those nicknames really mean? Why did students

31:01.511 --> 31:04.154
come up with those? Oh, I think it was affection, 
maybe. I agree with you. They weren't mean. Not at

31:16.672 --> 31:17.233
all. Maybe perfection may be too strong. I don't 
know. But they weren't mean. I think it was kind of

31:22.141 --> 31:24.045
affection and respect. Now, correct me if I'm 
wrong. They did not ever intentionally use those.
