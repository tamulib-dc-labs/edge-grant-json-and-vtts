WEBVTT

00:02.107 --> 00:12.462
That

00:02.107 --> 00:12.462
Gordy became a very big five percenter in 
Washington. He became a

00:13.263 --> 00:18.070
representative. Matter of fact, he became a 
representative of an air transport association.

00:24.297 --> 00:32.107
and he became a representer of some grain combines 
and he became a big five percenter. He made Drew

00:33.008 --> 00:36.153
Pearson's column several times. Really? Yes. 
Somebody tripped, tipped Drew Pearson off as to

00:38.255 --> 00:50.271
what happened to Gordon Moore in the military and 
told him that I could tell him the story. Drew

00:51.253 --> 00:53.916
Pearson called me a couple of times And a couple of 
his aides called me a couple of times, trying to get

00:54.318 --> 01:01.627
me to tell them the story of George Gordon Moore. 
And Moore calls himself, I don't know if, I haven't

01:02.468 --> 01:13.781
heard of the guy in three or four years now, but 
Moore calls himself retired Colonel George

01:02.468 --> 01:13.781
Gordon Moore. He uses the full colonel rank and 
says he's retired. Well, to get back, the first

01:19.648 --> 01:23.953
time I was nominated,

01:27.342 --> 01:29.184
to be a general officer. My name was removed at the 
White House when Eisenhower was the president. So

01:40.154 --> 01:41.896
your name got all the way up to the White House. It 
got all the way up to the White House. In other

01:43.618 --> 01:45.880
words, the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Oh, hell yes. I 
got all the way out of the Department of the Army and

01:46.901 --> 01:51.285
the Secretary of Defense. At the White House, it's 
just kind of a rubber stamp before it goes to

01:51.906 --> 01:56.370
confirmation. Sure. I was told in a very secret 
channel that my name was removed in the White

01:57.464 --> 02:03.233
House. And then later when I was nominated and it 
went on through, then I was nominated twice for my

02:04.134 --> 02:22.543
second star and I was told by some very good 
authority the second time when I was in my last

02:04.134 --> 02:22.543
command there in Philadelphia that some friends 
of General Eisenhower had seen to it that my name

02:22.928 --> 02:29.234
was removed at the White House. Yeah. That's a 
fact. Even though LBJ was in. Even though LBJ was

02:34.699 --> 02:38.563
in, yeah. And I had a couple of guys that went to LBJ 
about it, and I knew President Johnson, but it was

02:38.583 --> 02:51.855
quite a political ploy. The chief of staff at that 
time was a guy named Johnson. And he wasn't a good

02:58.192 --> 03:11.844
friend of mine, but the promotion board had 
recommended it and I'd been filling a two-star

02:58.192 --> 03:11.844
billet in that command for three years. And so, but 
my name didn't get through, didn't get up to the

03:13.285 --> 03:20.031
Senate. And even Senator Goldwater, was all teed 
off about it. He was, he told me, I saw him three or

03:26.426 --> 03:31.434
four years after that. As a matter of fact, I saw him 
when I was working for Scott. And he said, he said,

03:37.183 --> 03:47.340
your second star really, really was kicked around 
in circles in Washington. But he said, I admire

03:48.957 --> 03:53.862
what you did. So this is about the most noteworthy 
thing about my career. Isn't it a shame when

04:01.730 --> 04:03.511
someone's honest? But I'm proud to have done it 
because I believe that the least that an

04:03.732 --> 04:15.083
individual can do is to is to serve with dignity and 
to serve with honesty.

04:22.304 --> 04:37.709
And any son of a bitch that achieves his purpose by 
utter falsification and deliberate utter

04:22.304 --> 04:37.709
falsification, because he had to falsify a 
transcript and take a photo of it. He made a fake

04:37.729 --> 04:40.834
transcript and then photostatted it. the 
university guys admitted that it was the farm that

04:43.362 --> 04:50.393
the university used for their transcripts. Says 
he must have gotten the farm from somebody in the

04:50.813 --> 05:02.190
registrar's office and just typed in all these, 
and most of the courses that he typed in were

04:50.813 --> 05:02.190
correct courses. So he got a catalog of the 
university. Yeah, he got a catalog and gave

05:05.635 --> 05:11.344
himself enough course credit to graduate. So I got 
a big charge out of it, and I haven't told this story

05:11.982 --> 05:20.970
in this detail in a long, long time. But it was a big 
thing, and it was a big thing to me at the time. But

05:29.017 --> 05:37.005
it's been a little thing, because since I retired, 
you know, the fortune has been real good to me.

05:38.006 --> 05:39.627
Well, if there were... You were just in charge of 
the military personnel for the quartermaster.

05:44.566 --> 05:49.974
And

05:44.566 --> 05:49.974
you found that many discrepancies. You found 89 
discrepancies out of 9,000. How many

05:53.279 --> 05:57.104
discrepancies did the entire army find? Did they 
carry out their own investigations? Did the

06:00.208 --> 06:01.350
military? No, they didn't. Or the Navy or Air 
Force? Not completely, no. I would say there are

06:04.554 --> 06:08.500
probably several thousand. officers, most of 
them probably retired by now, but several

06:08.800 --> 06:18.511
thousand officers served under false 
conditions. I, I'm sorry to say that, but it's

06:20.073 --> 06:22.916
goddamn true. Oh, why didn't, why didn't the rest 
of the army take the cue from what you were finding?

06:29.164 --> 06:35.130
I think it, uh, the theory was why rock the boat, you 
know? Yeah, why rock the boat? Everything's going

06:37.893 --> 06:52.153
along smooth, but it always, it irks me to see 
people get advantage over people that do right,

06:37.893 --> 06:52.153
and people get advantage over them by doing wrong. 
Because there was so damn many, and I know people I

06:52.954 --> 07:07.174
served with during the war, that just wanted to be 
in the regular service, but were not accepted in

06:52.954 --> 07:07.174
the integration, and yet there was some sum of 
bitches that were crooks, that got it, and these

07:07.829 --> 07:13.555
good people didn't have the opportunity to serve. 
And this is what bothered me. So I

07:16.177 --> 07:29.530
really,

07:16.177 --> 07:29.530
but I've done very, very well since I left the 
service. I walked out of my office in

07:29.550 --> 07:34.495
Philadelphia, my command in South Philly, Drove 
out to the airport to Scott's corporate

07:35.217 --> 07:41.963
headquarters and was a corporate vice president. 
Had about twice the salary that I was making then as

07:43.084 --> 07:53.553
a general officer and served there for three years 
and could have stayed on until I retired. But this

07:54.795 --> 08:03.182
opportunity opened up down here and I came back 
down here and made an accommodation to take over

07:54.795 --> 08:03.182
this business. Well, so it's been very rewarding. 
I was wondering about something else that's in a

08:07.043 --> 08:17.071
sense similar to this, and it was also going on in 
Washington around 1950, and that is McCarthyism.

08:17.531 --> 08:17.712
Yeah. And in what way did McCarthyism affect the 
Army, as far as you're concerned? Did it have any

08:27.940 --> 08:33.405
impact on you as chief of personnel for the 
quartermaster? I don't believe that it did.

08:35.127 --> 08:42.838
McCarthyism, I think, there's a... McCarthyism 
exists today. It's a malady. And the use of the word

08:46.824 --> 08:57.019
following the name of the man that so personified 
those traits and those ethics. I don't think that

08:58.421 --> 09:02.447
McCarthyism per se really had a big impact on the 
army. I think that military people have got to

09:06.364 --> 09:30.949
function in a fishbowl and have got to function 
with integrity and honesty because ultimately

09:06.364 --> 09:30.949
the people in the country have their ultimate 
faith in what the military can do for them. The

09:35.179 --> 09:45.513
military are supposed to be the final 
protectorate of the way of life and the

09:35.179 --> 09:45.513
perpetuation of the country. And if the people in 
the country can't have respect for the military,

09:45.533 --> 09:56.768
why, I think we're in a bad way. And I think that one 
way that we can ensure that they have respect for

10:00.207 --> 10:14.845
the military, is for the military people to serve 
honorably and to carry on their life and their

10:00.207 --> 10:14.845
decorum in an honorable way. Well, what about the 
fact that Senator McCarthy charged that there was

10:15.266 --> 10:24.898
a Red General in the Army, a Brigadier General? I 
think he was a supply officer, as a matter of fact.

10:27.894 --> 10:28.996
Yeah, I don't know. And then Secretary of Army 
Stevens had to go to Congress, which was one of the

10:29.036 --> 10:38.828
downfalls of McCarthy and all the hearings. Yeah, 
this guy, this officer was supposed to have been at

10:38.948 --> 10:44.555
Fort Monmouth, I think. Signal Corps, yeah. I had 
met the guy, I forget the name. I do too. I forget it,

10:50.622 --> 10:52.725
but I had met him. Bob Stevens, the Secretary of the 
Army that you alluded to there, I know him very

10:53.347 --> 10:59.895
well. Robert T. Stevens, who had been the 
Secretary, because he was the titular head of J.P.

11:00.015 --> 11:14.413
Stevens and Company, a big textile, and I got to 
know him very well and in my command.

11:19.239 --> 11:21.642
Bob Stevens was a hell of a fine guy. I think one of 
the most noteworthy

11:23.452 --> 11:53.273
speeches ranks as far as I'm concerned alongside 
Lincoln's Gettysburg Address was during the

11:23.452 --> 11:53.273
McCarthy hearings when the army lawyer made that 
statement to McCarthy when McCarthy chastised

11:23.452 --> 11:53.273
this young lawyer that worked for Welch and Welch 
looked at him and said Mr. McCarthy you and your

11:53.557 --> 11:57.982
Venom have done a great damage to a fine young man. 
And is there no compassion in your soul at all? That

12:01.606 --> 12:06.492
was really a very dramatic speech that Welch made.

12:10.336 --> 12:18.806
So that was really a big thing in our family and in my 
circle of friends in the military. Every once in a

12:19.066 --> 12:22.770
while, I'll see somebody and they'll They'll want 
to know about Gordon Moore. But I looked on it very

12:29.948 --> 12:37.600
philosophically.

12:37.720 --> 12:39.402
It didn't bother me at all. In what year were you 
sent to the Far East? 54. Okay, so in 1954. Oh,

12:49.898 --> 12:53.483
there's another thing I wanted to ask you before we 
move on to that. And that is, as Chief of the

12:54.155 --> 13:01.526
Military Personnel for Quartermaster, you must 
have had some major problems during Korea. Yes, it

13:01.546 --> 13:02.288
was. What were they? Calling people to active duty 
was a major problem. And the compassionate,

13:08.417 --> 13:17.872
nearly everybody had a compassionate problem of 
they didn't want to come to duty. And if they did

13:18.893 --> 13:22.018
want, they would want three months or two months or 
six months so they could get their affairs in

13:22.201 --> 13:27.168
order. And then assigning people to units that 
were going to Korea was a compassionate, a lot of

13:28.710 --> 13:38.284
compassionate thing. We had a lot of requests for 
compassionate deferment and compassionate

13:38.824 --> 13:48.478
delay of recall and this sort of thing.

13:53.318 --> 13:56.082
It was a real trying time. It was even, of course I 
wasn't in, had no personnel actions during

13:56.142 --> 14:02.210
Vietnam.

14:04.793 --> 14:07.677
They were all logistic as far as Vietnam was 
concerned. I was over there a couple of times. I've

14:11.302 --> 14:18.972
been thinking a lot about Vietnam recently, 
particularly since the CBS report. the other day,

14:19.728 --> 14:24.133
or a couple of months ago, where they chastised 
Westmoreland. And while I wouldn't stand up in

14:25.635 --> 14:39.350
front of a big audience and make a speech and say 
that, there's a hell of a lot of truth in what the CBS

14:25.635 --> 14:39.350
had to report. Oh, we're going to talk about 
Vietnam. We'll talk about Vietnam, and we're

14:41.753 --> 14:47.419
going to talk about your role, and I want your ideas 
on it, too. But let's say that until we get out

14:47.499 --> 14:49.161
there. OK. Why don't we because that's important. 
You said that 69 were resigned right on the spot in

14:53.879 --> 15:02.372
that Eisen, not Eisenhower, in that Moore affair. 
And what happened to the rest of that? Well, like I

15:05.097 --> 15:07.821
said, those 69 resigned. And 12, we put a memo for 
record in their file absolving them and saying

15:07.901 --> 15:15.553
that the case is closed. and the others went before 
board just like Garnie Moore and like he, they were

15:15.972 --> 15:24.907
removed from the service without honor and 
without dishonor. So there wasn't a single one

15:26.670 --> 15:28.313
that survived? Not a single one survived, not a 
single one. And in other words, you were right in

15:30.917 --> 15:33.462
all the acquisitions? We were, we were absolutely 
right in all of them and minor discrepancies,

15:33.482 --> 15:40.073
they're probably the personnel people that 
screened the files under the ground rules we laid

15:40.863 --> 16:03.934
down said there were probably 500 minor 
discrepancies where someone had claimed 65 hours

15:40.863 --> 16:03.934
of credit when the actual university or college 
said well they only had 59 hours or 62 hours or

15:40.863 --> 16:03.934
something like that. where they said they'd gone 
to school for five semesters and maybe they'd only

16:04.538 --> 16:12.012
gone four semesters. And we thought they were 
minor discrepancies. And all of them, where there

16:15.619 --> 16:19.847
was a discrepancy, over the actual record and what 
the FBI background report had shown, we put a

16:20.502 --> 16:45.447
statement in their file saying the discrepancy 
had been accepted and recognized and absolved and

16:20.502 --> 16:45.447
the case was closed so that there wouldn't be any 
continuing going into these things in the future.

16:46.388 --> 16:53.017
Today on where we left off last time, and that was in 
Japan. Today is the 17th of August, 1982. This is

16:56.982 --> 17:01.047
our second interview with General Kinderdine. 
And you were the commander of the United States

17:01.668 --> 17:10.620
Petroleum Facilities in the Far East, and you were 
stationed in Japan. Yeah, with headquarters in

17:10.700 --> 17:15.366
Yokohama on Tokyo Bay. And this was a series of 
petroleum storage and distribution facilities

17:15.515 --> 17:34.317
throughout the Japanese islands, including 
Hokkaido and Honshu and Kyushu. Honshu being the

17:34.978 --> 17:45.370
main island where Tokyo and Yokohama and so forth 
are located, and Hokkaido, the most northern

17:34.978 --> 17:45.370
island, included in that was one pipeline that was 
laid from a little port city of Hatchanoi about 35

17:47.257 --> 18:02.934
miles up the beach to an air base and we operated 
that pipeline. In addition, the storage

18:04.295 --> 18:16.588
facilities that the U.S. built in Okinawa were 
under our technical supervision and some

18:04.295 --> 18:16.588
facilities in Korea likewise were. All of our 
facilities in Japan were former patrolling

18:18.239 --> 18:31.398
facilities that the Japanese government had 
built in preparation for World War II. They were

18:32.159 --> 18:37.107
all underground storage tanks, concrete 
underground storage tanks. And the Japanese had

18:38.449 --> 18:43.737
built some 30 million barrels of underground 
storage. And when the war was over, hardly any of it

18:47.348 --> 18:54.238
was even slightly damaged by the extensive 
bombing because it was hardened. They were

18:54.879 --> 18:56.922
hardened sites and underground. And therefore we 
had a beautiful set of terminals and facilities to

18:58.284 --> 19:17.052
move into to store the Navy special fuel oil for the 
fleet and diesel for the fleet and the military and

18:58.284 --> 19:17.052
aviation gasoline and jet fuel and motor fuel. 
which we brought directly from the Middle East.

19:21.553 --> 19:24.196
Oh, that's what I was going to ask you. Was this 
American oil? 90% of it came directly to us by

19:26.119 --> 19:44.440
tanker from the Middle East, from Rastanura and 
ports in the Persian Gulf, and was lifted to us by

19:26.119 --> 19:44.440
MSTS tankers and by commercial contract tankers. 
Some aviation gasolines came from the west coast

19:45.095 --> 19:50.981
U.S. and from Venezuela. And some motor fuel, 
very, very little motor fuel came from the U.S. or

19:52.563 --> 20:01.092
from Venezuela. All of that came from the Middle 
East. And we operated, we rehabilitated and

20:04.556 --> 20:10.562
operated about 20 million barrel capacity of 
these underground facilities. There were

20:17.221 --> 20:21.307
several terminals that we made no attempt to 
rehabilitate them. Even though they had a little

20:23.450 --> 20:32.263
dirty oil and tank bottoms in them, they could have 
been rehabilitated very easily. And the job was

20:33.307 --> 20:37.373
not just for the Army now. This was for all of our 
forces. For all the U.S. forces, Army, Navy, Air

20:39.275 --> 21:02.487
Force, and Marine, the whole U.S. And also we 
provided support when requested to other NATO

20:39.275 --> 21:02.487
members, such as the British, any fleet units they 
had operating in the area if they needed to have

20:39.275 --> 21:02.487
some fuel out. So it was a joint operation and a 
very, very extensive one. We pretty much, we ran

21:10.543 --> 21:27.747
our own laboratories to test the quality control 
on every tanker load and we did a lot of minor

21:10.543 --> 21:27.747
research on some fuels. As a matter of fact, that's 
where I became so enamored with The study of jet

21:34.023 --> 21:39.170
fuel, turbine fuel, the aviation turbine fuel was 
in Japan. I had a very fine laboratory on Tokyo Bay

21:39.310 --> 21:56.875
that was staffed by a couple of former professors 
of chemistry in the university and we ran And we got

21:58.677 --> 22:21.604
so interested in turbine fuel and jet fuel that we 
investigated several phenomena, one of them

21:58.677 --> 22:21.604
being the growth of bacteria in jet fuel, which was 
showing itself even in some aircraft tanks. This

22:21.805 --> 22:27.992
bacteria grows at the interface between jet fuel 
and water. and it was particularly growth, it

22:28.698 --> 22:39.737
showed a particular growth when the jet fuel and 
water had an interface in a concrete tank. There

22:39.758 --> 22:46.970
was something in the concrete walls that seemed to 
leach out and it was truly a bacteria growth. I know

22:48.573 --> 22:53.642
the first time one of the Japanese chemists showed 
me this beaker with jet fuel and water, this thing

22:54.263 --> 23:06.461
that looked like the mother on a bottle of vinegar, 
the thick scum that you often refer to a long time

22:54.263 --> 23:06.461
ago as a mother in a bottle of vinegar. And then he 
said he believed it was a living organism. And I

23:11.148 --> 23:17.117
said, well, I don't believe it is an inorganic 
fuel. So about two weeks later, he showed it to me

23:17.137 --> 23:23.747
again, and it was about twice as big as it was. So I 
said, I believe you're right, it is a living

23:24.335 --> 23:27.358
organism. And we sent samples to the National 
Bureau of Standards and several other

23:27.378 --> 23:36.767
laboratories.

23:36.847 --> 23:42.692
It had been known before and recognized, but 
nobody really knew what to do about it. And some oil

23:43.313 --> 23:53.042
companies got busy on it and developed an additive 
to put in the fuel that would really prevent this

23:53.832 --> 23:56.015
from happening. But I understand about a year or so 
ago they had another outbreak of it. And it was

24:02.062 --> 24:10.273
particularly prevalent in Southeast Asia and in 
the South Pacific for some reason or another. But

24:10.293 --> 24:22.388
anyway, these facilities out there were, it was a 
very, very satisfying operation and It was about

24:24.005 --> 24:35.580
1,500 miles from one end of my little command to the 
other, the furthest terminal on Hokkaido to the

24:24.005 --> 24:35.580
furthest terminal on Kyushu. And we helped to 
design some underground tanks that the U.S. built

24:37.182 --> 24:45.954
in Okinawa. We sort of patterned them after the 
Japanese tanks. The Japanese showed great

24:49.599 --> 24:51.902
ingenuity What they did, they built a standard 
underground tank which was about 150 feet in

24:52.675 --> 25:13.565
diameter and about 90 feet tall with the walls were 
tapered. They were thickest at the bottom where

25:13.966 --> 25:20.235
the greatest pressure would be because of the 
standing column of liquid. And they tapered up to

25:20.722 --> 25:27.147
where they were maybe four inches thick at the top. 
And the way they did, rather than make an

25:28.428 --> 25:43.581
excavation of 90-odd feet and cover it over, 
they'd find a location near a port of discharge

25:28.428 --> 25:43.581
that was kind of hilly with little hills and little 
ravines. Then they'd build a tank down in the

25:44.282 --> 25:50.627
ravine and then fill in around it, which was a 
pretty ingenious thing. way to do it. I imagine it

25:51.971 --> 25:53.753
saved a lot of time. And they built all this system 
and from the middle to the late twenties and in the

25:54.653 --> 26:14.113
thirties, early thirties, getting ready for the 
eventual world war that they were going to wage in

25:54.653 --> 26:14.113
all of Southeast Asia and the Pacific. Now how did 
you get along with the people of Japan? Very, very

26:17.076 --> 26:18.137
well. The people in Japan were, I think, easier to 
work with and better to work with than the Germans

26:21.995 --> 26:31.589
in the occupation period. The Japanese were more 
subservient, is that the right word for it? And

26:39.761 --> 26:43.827
they're certainly more courteous and more 
cordial. You always had the feeling that maybe,

26:45.169 --> 26:50.196
you know, they were real nice to you and everything 
Maybe if you were sleeping with your back turned to

26:51.053 --> 26:57.080
them, they might stick a knife in you, but I don't 
really believe that. I got along very well with

26:58.922 --> 27:00.504
them. And the

27:01.104 --> 27:08.493
Japanese can be trusted. I don't think they can be 
trusted as much as the Chinese. I think the Chinese

27:12.818 --> 27:19.305
have a code of ethics and a code of conduct that's 
stronger than the Japanese. But the Japanese, in

27:20.028 --> 27:32.360
the true oriental tradition, respect, and you can 
trust their respect because they would lose face

27:20.028 --> 27:32.360
if you didn't. Now, when you were there, weren't we 
starting to rebuild their armed forces? Oh, yes,

27:37.865 --> 27:39.087
yes. The Japanese self-defense forces. Sure. We 
worked very closely with them. In fact, we had some

27:44.632 --> 27:49.697
joint maneuvers with them, joint petroleum 
supply maneuvers with them. And I got very

27:50.774 --> 27:56.062
friendly with several of the high-ranking 
officers. When I left Japan, when I came back to the

27:56.162 --> 28:08.421
States, they gave me a big party and came down to the 
airport when we left and gave me a plaque of

27:56.162 --> 28:08.421
appreciation and everything. I got along very, 
very well with them. I've talked to other officers

28:11.817 --> 28:35.638
who are in the Orient, especially Korea, and some 
in Japan, and they said that there's always the

28:11.817 --> 28:35.638
problem when you're dealing with the Orient of 
bribes,

28:11.817 --> 28:35.638
which they see more as a standard way to do 
business. And of course, in America, we don't. Did

28:39.041 --> 28:40.322
you ever have any Oh, very definitely. See, we had a 
lot of contact with Japanese industry. I would

28:48.150 --> 28:50.052
think so, especially in your position. Yeah. For 
example, one real good one that I made a good

28:51.273 --> 29:08.993
lasting friendship that even exists today was 
with a Japanese contractor over there that

28:51.273 --> 29:08.993
rehabilitated steel drums, you know, 55-gallon 
steel drums, because we had mountains of them. all

29:11.858 --> 29:29.676
sorts of things came to us in drums and they would be 
issued out to the troops and everything and be

29:11.858 --> 29:29.676
emptied and then we'd bring them back in because 
they represented quite a monetary investment,

29:11.858 --> 29:29.676
these 55-gallon steel drums. So we periodically 
have to have these things rehabilitated, cleaned

29:29.696 --> 29:39.246
out and repainted and new bums put in them and so 
forth. And rather than have a facility to do this,

29:41.693 --> 29:43.935
We did it on contract. And we had this Japanese 
contractor in the Yokohama, Tokyo area that did a

29:43.955 --> 29:54.847
very fine job and did it for a very, very good price. 
And we put these out on competitive bid, and nine

29:54.927 --> 30:01.394
times out of ten, he would get the business. His 
name was Saito, S-A-I-T-O. I forget the name of his

30:06.399 --> 30:11.464
company, but he was Saito himself. So we got 
pretty, pretty well acquainted with him and he was

30:12.659 --> 30:31.323
constantly

30:12.659 --> 30:31.323
wanting to entertain us and wanting us to go to the 
geisha houses with him and have dinner with him and

30:12.659 --> 30:31.323
so forth. And, but one time I told him, I said, look, 
no, and he couldn't speak any English, but he had a

30:33.045 --> 30:39.493
pretty good interpreter. a right-handed man and a 
gal that spoke good English that worked for him. I

30:44.752 --> 31:04.620
said, I won't go to a geisha house with you for a big 
evening of entertainment and dinner and so forth,

30:44.752 --> 31:04.620
but if you and Mrs. Saito will take me and Mrs. 
Kender down, we'll go with you if you'll make it a

30:44.752 --> 31:04.620
family affair. So this was very strange, very 
unusual because Japanese men don't take their

31:05.782 --> 31:12.430
wives to a geisha house. And a geisha, a refined 
geisha house is really not a whorehouse. The

31:17.877 --> 31:35.518
geisha girls, some of them will engage in sexual 
favors, but mostly a geisha house is a place where

31:17.877 --> 31:35.518
you go and eat and the patrons are pampered and they 
are entertained by the geisha girls. dances and

31:36.005 --> 31:39.529
playing the samisans and all the instruments. So 
he finally, they finally agreed that he and Mrs.

31:40.811 --> 31:59.134
Saito and his daughter Sachi, they would go with 
him and then we would bring, I'd bring my wife and

31:40.811 --> 31:59.134
bring my

31:40.811 --> 31:59.134
son. He was about 12 years old, I guess. Yeah. 
Anyway. The daughter, the girl wasn't quite old

32:06.228 --> 32:08.872
enough. So we did. Went to this swanky geisha house 
in Tokyo. And I know the evening must have cost a

32:13.999 --> 32:16.943
fortune. And Mrs. Saito threw her daughter Sachi, 
who spoke a little, and she said that this is the

32:18.805 --> 32:28.759
first time in all her life she'd ever been inside of 
a geisha house. None of her Japanese lady friends

32:29.320 --> 32:33.005
had ever been to a geisha house. Oh, they thought it 
was wonderful. That gave her something to talk

32:35.455 --> 32:37.317
about for months. Oh yeah, that was really 
something. So we established a very good rapport

32:39.519 --> 32:45.745
with the family of this contractor. When we got 
ready to leave Japan and come back to the States,

32:47.686 --> 32:55.994
they gave us a big going away party at their home. Oh 
great. We went to their home. And just before we

32:58.637 --> 33:04.382
were departing, he wanted to make a presento to me. 
And he brought out a Canon camera with all the,

33:04.615 --> 33:12.542
every kind of lens you can ever think for it. And I'm 
sure it had a value of, oh, $1,500, $2,000,

33:13.863 --> 33:19.428
something like that. Had the whole thing all 
beautifully wrapped up. And I thanked him for it

33:24.053 --> 33:26.795
and so forth. And then I told him that it's just 
impossible that I can accept this because it's

33:26.815 --> 33:34.622
forbidden even though it may be strange, sound 
strange to him, it's just forbidden that we could

33:35.412 --> 33:45.464
accept anything like this in my position. And he 
was always just crestfallen. He said, well, can

33:49.769 --> 33:53.734
your son, can we give it to your son? And I said, no, 
that's just not possible. So the guy, his aide that

33:59.341 --> 34:13.934
spoke to Ingrid said, well, could you just take it 
overnight, and then tomorrow morning when they

33:59.341 --> 34:13.934
meet you at the airport, give it back to me. And I 
said, well, yes, we'll do this. So that it would

34:17.116 --> 34:21.680
look like I had accepted it, and then I left it back 
there with him. So we did that. And I would have

34:24.042 --> 34:28.386
liked to have taken it, but I just couldn't do it. 
Nobody would have known about it, I'm sure, but I

34:28.906 --> 34:32.431
just couldn't do it. But there were a number of 
examples like that. Oh, yeah, a number of them.

34:38.038 --> 34:38.338
Were there? Oh, perfect. We've gotten, we stayed 
in contact with the Saitos through the years, and

34:39.280 --> 34:58.525
my wife and I went over to Tokyo two years ago, and 
Mr. Saito is dead, and his wife is dead, but the

34:39.280 --> 34:58.525
daughter is still there, and she's married one of 
the leading movie stars, In Japan today. No

35:00.134 --> 35:00.434
kidding. Yeah. And they came to the hotel. We 
stayed at the Nuotani Hotel in Tokyo. And her

35:08.726 --> 35:11.810
husband is a beautiful, good-looking guy. We had 
seen his picture in a Japanese commercial on

35:12.631 --> 35:16.937
television. They drove up to that one. We didn't 
see him when they drove up, but we had dinner there,

35:18.479 --> 35:22.144
luncheon on a Sunday. And then they wanted to take 
us out to the Saito home, which they still have. And

35:28.053 --> 35:36.543
he had a Corvette, American Corvette, which cost 
in Tokyo probably about $50,000. And they drove us

35:37.604 --> 35:42.229
out to their place and showed us a videotape of 
their wedding. They had married about a year

35:42.690 --> 35:45.373
before. And they plugged in the video in the Sony 
and showed us a videotape of their wedding. And it

35:53.242 --> 35:57.587
was quite a, and we corresponded with them since 
then. And they're supposed to, last thing we

35:58.462 --> 36:04.190
heard, they're supposed to come over to the 
States. And we may go out to California and meet

36:05.072 --> 36:09.658
them. But there was lots of examples like that. And 
I personally know of a lot of guys that took things

36:12.963 --> 36:20.394
from the Japanese. Not, I don't believe in the,

36:25.512 --> 36:33.924
true sense of a bribe or what have you, but when it 
comes right down to nuts and bolts, that's exactly

36:25.512 --> 36:33.924
what it was, really. But that's a big thing in the 
Far East, a very big thing. What does the military

36:38.831 --> 36:40.674
have to say about it? Well, it's strictly 
forbidden. It's strictly forbidden. It's

36:44.439 --> 36:48.685
against all procurement regulations.

36:50.707 --> 36:57.574
It's unethical and it's certainly illegal 
partisan procurement regulations. And were

36:57.594 --> 37:04.441
there any cases that came up during that time or any 
examples that the military used? I believe there

37:04.541 --> 37:09.065
was in connection with the exchange system, the 
post-exchange system. I believe some civilian

37:09.185 --> 37:16.933
employee buyers in the exchange system and maybe 
an officer or two were tried by courts martial. I

37:22.675 --> 37:23.977
believe they were, yeah. But no big deal. No 
ranking person. I know of a pretty high ranking guy

37:31.991 --> 37:42.769
in Tokyo that took a lot of favors from Japanese 
that he shouldn't have taken. far beyond a casual

37:43.930 --> 37:47.936
luncheon or something like that. I had a couple of 
luncheons with Saito, but then other times I would

37:47.956 --> 37:59.454
take him to the officer's club for lunch and pay for 
it and so forth. And how did, how did that, what did

37:59.474 --> 38:05.524
the military think when you took a contractor to 
the officer's club? That was okay. That was okay,

38:06.706 --> 38:07.988
yeah. Yeah, that's just, you know, just 
professional in business courtesy. If he was

38:15.806 --> 38:25.193
there during the time and you saw it feasible and he 
was performing the service, for the military to

38:25.493 --> 38:32.220
take him to the club, and of course you pay for it. 
He's your guest, just like anybody would do, so

38:32.240 --> 38:36.405
there was nothing wrong with that. Why did you 
leave Japan? Your tour of duty was over? Yeah, tour

38:38.968 --> 38:40.049
of duty was over. And you went to France now. I came 
back to the States, came back to the States, and I

38:42.291 --> 38:52.362
guess

38:55.025 --> 38:59.995
I then went to headquarters third army in Fort 
McPherson, Georgia.

39:03.541 --> 39:09.152
And I was there in the southeastern part of the 
United States and from there I was selected in a

39:09.554 --> 39:16.602
very prestigious selection to go to the Harvard 
Business School. I noticed that in 1959. Yeah, to

39:18.404 --> 39:20.767
the Advanced Management program. And tell me 
about earlier you, of course, had gone to the Army

39:20.907 --> 39:33.942
War College, but most young men in their careers, 
their ascension, go to the War College, but very

39:20.907 --> 39:33.942
few ever go to the Harvard Business School. Yeah, 
and it's still true today. selection the military

39:37.178 --> 39:52.268
for since after the war the military and the 
government have made a practice to our every class

39:37.178 --> 39:52.268
of the advanced management program at the HBS The 
Army sends two or three people. The Air Force sends

39:57.276 --> 40:00.460
one or two. The Navy sends one or two, depending 
upon budgetary situation. The CIA and the

40:07.710 --> 40:21.148
Department of State and Department of Commerce, 
Department of Interior, between those three or

40:07.710 --> 40:21.148
four agencies, there are two or three go. So 
they're about... four to six people from

40:23.197 --> 40:30.725
government that are in each class of the Harvard 
Business School. And how large are the classes

40:30.745 --> 40:32.427
usually? The classes are about 200,

40:32.447 --> 40:38.093
maybe 225. I think they're a little bit larger now. 
And I was in the 36th AMP, Advanced Management

40:42.117 --> 40:48.044
Program. And it has been looked upon since the war

40:54.719 --> 41:04.047
that if you're selected to go to the Harvard 
Business School, it's almost tantamount that

40:54.719 --> 41:04.047
you're going to be selected to flag rank. In fact, I 
think the records will show that less than 5% of the

41:04.127 --> 41:23.545
people from military or government that go to the 
Harvard Business School, it's a pretty expensive

41:04.127 --> 41:23.545
thing for the government. Less than 5% have failed 
to be promoted to flag rank. In my class, there was

41:30.430 --> 41:37.378
only one guy from the military that didn't get flag 
rank. He was a fellow from the Transportation

41:37.419 --> 41:40.502
Corps. Very, very brilliant guy. But anyway, the 
Harvard Business School, the military pays all

41:44.548 --> 41:53.599
your tuition, which even then was quite 
considerable, and now it's Well, I think it's

41:54.203 --> 42:00.990
about $8,000, $9,000, $10,000 for this 
five-month course. It's a five-month course,

42:01.130 --> 42:07.716
and is it part of the MBA program there? Part of the 
MBA program. You get a five-month capsule of the

42:08.857 --> 42:16.344
two-year MBA program, really. I see. And they 
really give it to you in a very concentrated form

42:17.265 --> 42:22.050
and really a high-level form. But the military, of 
course, paid my tuition, and they paid me the

42:22.807 --> 42:43.737
normal per diem that I would make on temporary 
duty, which at that time was $15 or $16 a day that

42:22.807 --> 42:43.737
they paid us to pay for your meal and your hotel and 
so forth. Well, that won't pay for anything.

42:46.904 --> 42:54.853
Hardly, and wouldn't then, in those cases, pay for 
your board and your meals at Harvard and

42:46.904 --> 42:54.853
everything. So, it's traditional, and this has 
never been written in a book or anything, but this

42:54.913 --> 43:08.108
is traditional, and of course you find this out 
from guys that have been there. People from the

43:09.009 --> 43:16.438
military and from government are adopted by 
people from industry when they go to the Harvard

43:16.942 --> 43:18.826
Business School. In other words, in your class 
will be vice presidents from Exxon and from

43:20.028 --> 43:32.433
General Electric and people that are going to be 
promoted when they come back to vice president or

43:20.028 --> 43:32.433
something. And even some presidents of small 
companies or executive vice presidents and so

43:33.335 --> 43:38.545
forth. I didn't know anything about this adoption 
per se when I went up there. So I went up there and

43:45.756 --> 43:51.643
you're assigned to a group of men. A group of men are 
assigned together to what they call a can group.

43:58.372 --> 44:09.426
And a can group are the, I think it's six men that 
live in six rooms. that used the same bathroom

44:09.862 --> 44:12.346
facilities. They had one bathroom in this 
dormitory set up like they had there then, where

44:12.427 --> 44:23.126
these six bedrooms and study rooms used the same 
bathroom. Very nice, the laboratories and

44:23.407 --> 44:26.632
commodes and everything. Sufficient for six men. 
There were two or three commodes and two or three

44:28.516 --> 44:32.062
laboratories. I think there were four 
laboratories. We never had any conflict in the

44:34.027 --> 44:48.140
bathroom because it was so much, very, very nice, 
which was between three rooms here, bathroom,

44:34.027 --> 44:48.140
three rooms there on a floor, and then above you was 
the same thing in a stairwell. So that was your can

44:48.480 --> 44:54.265
group, C-A-N, can group, because you use the same 
can. That's where it got its name. So I got

44:57.108 --> 45:00.511
acquainted with my guys in the can group. One of my 
guys... while I was there got polio, a very light

45:03.524 --> 45:09.952
case of polio, and we all worked on him. I guess I did 
more than anybody, massaging him and everything,

45:10.012 --> 45:23.449
and of course the Harvard Medical School clinic 
and everything administered to him, and he had a

45:10.012 --> 45:23.449
remarkable recovery from this light case of 
polio. Another guy in my can group is today the

45:24.730 --> 45:30.257
chairman of Air Products Incorporated, and Hell 
of a brilliant guy. Well, anyway, about the second

45:35.229 --> 45:43.895
night I was there, well, I was sitting in my room, 
and the other five guys came in my room. I didn't

45:44.717 --> 45:46.643
know what the hell was going on.
