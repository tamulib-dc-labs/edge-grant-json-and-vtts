WEBVTT

00:02.410 --> 00:09.663
Oldest business in Richmond, I believe, has been 
in business continuously. I think the oldest one

00:09.683 --> 00:12.248
here is a lumber yard. It wasn't an old lumber 
company.

00:18.420 --> 00:20.143
That's Joe Clyde Westendorf, right? Yeah, well, 
it started out, it was, Oh, I don't remember now

00:27.453 --> 00:50.855
what the old original Wessendorf was here in that 
lumber business, but his boy, Tony Wessendorf,

00:27.453 --> 00:50.855
T.B., they called him, he took over back, 
somewhere back in 1900 or so. He was operating it

00:50.875 --> 00:56.420
before I started school. And Joe was his nephew, 
wasn't he? Well, Joe's daddy, that's Joe Clyde's

01:01.734 --> 01:08.763
daddy, was his nephew, Tony's nephew. Then it was 
Joe Clyde. And Joe Clyde's granddaddy, who had an

01:14.149 --> 01:21.698
insurance business here since way back before I 
can remember. And Joe Clyde inherited that from

01:23.520 --> 01:27.885
his granddaddy. Now, the Wessendorffs were some 
of the original settlers of Richmond, right?

01:33.058 --> 01:36.563
Well, they were pretty well, they were well fixed. 
But there was, oh shucks, Bertrand, Winston,

01:38.365 --> 01:56.370
Bassett, and so on down the line that had just all 
kinds of land, cattle, and then farm cutting.

01:58.831 --> 02:13.329
As long as 1919, right after the First World War, 
cotton, the price of cotton just went way up, you

01:58.831 --> 02:13.329
know. They made a big crop there. Everybody had 
lots of money. But cotton has been the main

02:19.998 --> 02:24.684
agricultural crop. Well... Then you came along 
with oil. There was a mill here that sugarcane.

02:35.164 --> 02:44.379
Across the bridge, you know, where the old Bill 
Williams Cafe is out there. That big cafe just a

02:44.399 --> 02:51.931
little past it all the way to Sugar Land used to be 
solid sugarcane. And the Bertrand Farm sugarcane

02:51.951 --> 02:54.555
then. But when the sugar cane business got to where 
they couldn't get help, at that time, you could

02:55.750 --> 03:05.061
rent convicts from the state. You had to have a 
building to keep them in, and bars on the windows,

03:06.683 --> 03:13.631
and so forth, and guards. But you could rent 
convicts. I don't have any idea how cheap, but I

03:15.673 --> 03:25.605
know they could rent them cheap, because the cane 
farmers over there used them. I think cut that out.

03:31.169 --> 03:37.759
Eventually, Sugar Land quit crushing cane. See, 
these farmers and the state, the state prison

03:38.941 --> 03:49.078
farmers, they didn't raise dogs like sugar cane.

03:50.898 --> 03:54.963
After the cane went out, well, then of course they 
went to cotton over there. The prairie farm went to

03:54.983 --> 03:57.106
cotton, too. But I don't know. It just seemed like 
the cotton farming, that is, these big farmers,

04:00.950 --> 04:10.622
they just gradually went down.

04:13.305 --> 04:19.453
There's more cotton farmers out on the prairie out 
here in recent years than anywhere. You're

04:21.239 --> 04:22.321
talking about oil. What is the booths on all of 
them? They own most of the oil at Thompson or who

04:26.226 --> 04:28.650
does? No, I wouldn't say. He said your oil. The 
Moore family that I'm talking about, different

04:34.940 --> 04:39.306
people here in Richmond had a lot of land. Now they 
have sulfur and oil. And the Goobles is down at

04:43.753 --> 04:47.478
Thompson. That's Burke Goobles and all of them? 
That's his folks, his ancestors, his folks. And

04:54.273 --> 04:57.897
Big Creek Oil Field, there's a lot of that. The A.P. 
George family had a lot. They were big branches and

05:02.081 --> 05:04.864
farmers. Big Creek Oil Field, practically all of 
it was on Bud Davis' ranch, and he was a brother of

05:04.884 --> 05:14.295
Mrs. A.P. George. Bud died while she inherited 
that. But the big Greek oil field was a sort of a

05:21.331 --> 05:29.900
minor operation for a good many years. They just, 
oh, here in the last several years, they've

05:30.801 --> 05:43.854
drilled wells out there and made lots of wells on 
that Davis Ranch. OK, how did Miss Agnes Booth, you

05:44.375 --> 05:48.199
know, like, there's, who, Who's her ancestors? Is 
she a George way back? No, no.

05:56.474 --> 05:57.876
Her husband had the money. She didn't have it. She 
married money. Mr. Tom Booth had the money.

06:07.406 --> 06:17.056
If our Booth estate is only two areas, then Mrs. 
August Martin, Tom Booth, and Agnes were married

06:07.406 --> 06:17.056
to Tom Booth. Because I knew, you know, that she 
Well, Helen Ann Ragsdale's, you know, her

06:18.892 --> 06:22.997
daughter-in-law. That's her daughter or her 
daughter-in-law? It's her daughter. Daughter,

06:25.080 --> 06:25.901
that's right. I guess it would be. Well, I know 
Helen Ann's been married a few times. But anyway,

06:30.366 --> 06:39.077
like, she, you know, she gets a lot of that money 
from those estates, you know, her un-gas amount

06:30.366 --> 06:39.077
that she was receiving. I couldn't believe it. But 
speaking about oil, Mr. Blaze, have you worked in

06:40.699 --> 06:47.548
the fields out here much? Thompson and Big Creek. 
Yeah, I worked at Thompson, Big Creek, Blue Ridge,

06:49.829 --> 07:02.564
and very little at Damon.

07:02.584 --> 07:10.372
In fact, I was real well just about any of them up and 
down the coast. That was when they had the Wooden

07:10.673 --> 07:13.796
Derricks and the R.M.N., right? That's when I 
started to have Wooden Derricks. Wooden derrick

07:19.507 --> 07:23.132
was pretty handy on cold nights. Cold nights in 
that derrick. Wooden derrick legs, all of that.

07:31.425 --> 07:45.306
Come out about so far each way from the corner of the 
derrick, you could back up in there and get out of

07:31.425 --> 07:45.306
that

07:31.425 --> 07:45.306
cold wind. Have you always been in the oil field? 
Since you've been here in Richmond? Well... I

07:50.900 --> 07:52.081
mean, most of the time. Practically most of the 
time. I pulled around both filling stations once

07:54.304 --> 08:00.192
and got out for a while.

08:06.741 --> 08:10.045
The only way I've ever been able to make a living, 
though, off of you. Yeah.

08:16.662 --> 08:20.186
He liked it, that's the way it goes. Yeah, I know, 
sir. I started rough-necking at that big creek. In

08:25.071 --> 08:27.774
fact, the first job I ever had was to find a boiler. 
Not a boiler, an A-boiler. A small one, at that. You

08:34.902 --> 08:35.783
worked the boiler? You were, well, actually a 
motorman, right? Huh? Farmer. Farmer? Oh. Well,

08:41.029 --> 08:45.994
there was an old man by the name of Rich. He promoted 
money to the River Wildcat down there across the

08:47.999 --> 08:58.314
creek from Big Creek off me. And he got down, oh, 
about 2,500 feet and had some six-inch casings set

08:58.334 --> 09:10.171
and run out of money.

09:12.895 --> 09:15.559
And he hired me to drive while he was rigged. So I was 
out there laying around watching that rig. Wasn't

09:22.721 --> 09:26.106
there a way for anybody to get in there and get him? 
There ain't anyone that's walked.

09:32.114 --> 09:35.219
So he got a little more money together. The driller 
come out there with a dead man and two roughnecks.

09:40.506 --> 09:45.613
Told me he was a father and mother of a mother's 
wife. He said, Father Boyle, you had your driver

09:46.420 --> 09:54.031
watching you, the farmer.

09:55.493 --> 10:06.469
With a little instruction from some of these 
roughnecks, I learned what to do to get some steam

09:55.493 --> 10:06.469
up. So I was a farmer.

10:10.675 --> 10:11.736
Fired with oil.

10:16.728 --> 10:22.714
Yeah, that's where I started.

10:22.734 --> 10:34.086
And then after he run out of money, then again, then 
I went to work in the Gulf out there, roughly. Gulf

10:34.106 --> 10:34.907
oil company? Mm-hmm. Who owns most of the wells 
down there? Isn't it Humboldt? Or Walexone? In Big

10:43.516 --> 10:44.237
Creek? Well, in Thompson and Big Creek. Well, in 
Big Creek, the Gulf Company got practically

10:47.053 --> 10:54.081
everything out there. Thompson and Gulf and 
Humboldt.

11:00.769 --> 11:03.552
How about Orchard, Joe? How about Orchard? Well, 
Gulf got the biggest part of that. Sulphur, too?

11:11.662 --> 11:12.823
Well, the... No, what's the name of that sulfur 
company? The plant now is shut down. They're

11:20.882 --> 11:24.986
getting all that sulfur out there in West Texas 
now. But, oh, shucks, what's the name of that

11:26.748 --> 11:31.814
sulfur company? Duval. Duval, yeah. When did they 
start, you know, drilling down here at Thompson?

11:38.302 --> 11:44.329
Thompson, they discovered, well, Thompson came 
in in 1932.

11:46.148 --> 12:03.967
But Big Creek, let's see, I believe in 1922, they 
moved a little steam rig in there, which, of

11:46.148 --> 12:03.967
course, at that time, this was a pretty good-sized 
drilling rig. But they drilled a well there on top

12:04.607 --> 12:14.738
of the dome, made a well that was 650 feet.

12:16.000 --> 12:23.749
It never was a whole lot of producer, but then they 
had to have oil to fire boil it with. And it amounted

12:25.712 --> 12:27.654
to a good bit. They pumped it there for a long time, 
the gasoline

12:27.674 --> 12:37.947
engine. There. Oh, they just jumped here and there 
and young of them. They make a well of caged linen,

12:42.591 --> 12:49.379
make a dry hole, put a rug in it. But they have gotten 
out here in the last, oh, eight, nine years or so,

12:49.399 --> 13:01.932
and got off around 80. They don't make a lot of 
wells. They're all pumping wells, but they're

13:03.894 --> 13:06.477
old. On that T.W. Davis lease, there must be 
isolated wells. There has been over 200

13:16.277 --> 13:23.485
wells drilled on it, but they're not all produced.

13:27.029 --> 13:30.573
They've got a good bit of production there on those 
pumping wells.

13:34.217 --> 13:35.198
Thompson Field. The golf company had that whole 
thing back in that leased up, back in that bottom.

13:48.795 --> 13:51.600
And they didn't think enough of it to drill a 
wildcat. So they gave Cullen West half interest in

13:52.041 --> 13:58.975
the whole work down there to drill a wildcat. And 
they went back in there. They had to cut trees down,

14:03.094 --> 14:06.458
build corduroy roads. And about the only way you 
could get in there was on a cat or horseback. But

14:13.005 --> 14:19.273
they made a well on the first hole, and they made a 
well there. And then the Covington West finally

14:19.293 --> 14:25.820
sold their half inches to the Humble Company. 
That's the way the Humble Company got in there. It

14:30.190 --> 14:32.613
wasn't Thompson, that was almost all black, 
right? What? Blacks, Negroes, right? Wasn't

14:36.196 --> 14:37.918
Thompson a lot of Negroes down there? Oh, yeah, 
they were. There were a lot of people on the ranch

14:39.480 --> 14:43.744
area and big places down there. Before that oil 
field came in, there was, oh, sure, the majority of

14:44.585 --> 14:55.557
the people were Negroes. However, there was one 
old nugget down there, old Y.U. Jones, that was

15:01.048 --> 15:03.752
worth a world of money. Y.U. Jones, is he still 
alive? No. Because I know there's a Y.U. Jones that

15:08.219 --> 15:09.361
I remember. That I know now. Okay, that's Y.U. 
Jones that works it. Because I see him. But Y.U.

15:19.175 --> 15:24.944
Jones, I don't think he ever got any money out of the 
oil business except at least money. He was... were

15:27.447 --> 15:30.992
practically cattlemen and nothing else. Can we go 
back to agriculture? Yes, ma'am. In the early

15:35.438 --> 15:39.805
1930s, they began to plant rice here. And they had a 
hard time making a go of it. They had a good year,

15:44.451 --> 15:52.202
fine, but, you know, some years weren't so good 
because they depended on manual labor. And I know

15:52.222 --> 15:53.404
that they really had a rough time of it the wives 
worked in stores and they did lots of things to help

15:54.059 --> 16:22.716
out to make things go then of course when it became 
mechanical it became a major

15:54.059 --> 16:22.716
agricultural activity in our county and they made 
a lot of money but like rice and let's see cotton and

15:54.059 --> 16:22.716
sugarcane but that's the only three things that 
they grow they don't grow any soybeans or They've

16:22.865 --> 16:25.708
never made a go with soybeans or corn? Well, they 
just... Well, a little maize, right? Corn and

16:30.632 --> 16:33.715
maize for their own use, primarily. They're 
rarely going to maize and soybeans now. Right, but

16:37.358 --> 16:38.780
they do. Primarily, your farmer planted cotton 
for his income and grains for his own use and hay for

16:38.800 --> 16:47.908
himself for his stock. Okay, going back to the 
Negroes, most of them around here were were

16:51.215 --> 16:54.600
former, well, descendants of former slaves, 
right? And that's how they got most of their land,

16:55.241 --> 16:59.267
like the ones over here on Thompson Highway? The 
biggest part of them back in the day was a tenant

16:59.407 --> 17:05.336
farm. The farming for white folks, that's the way 
they got their crops in. But down around Thompson,

17:18.716 --> 17:21.019
it's There's really been more cattle propagation 
down there than back years ago. Old Boss Slavin,

17:28.555 --> 17:31.378
Judy Hampton. Been to Booth, of course, on back 
land back in there. Yeah, the old Herzog

17:38.024 --> 17:41.067
plantation down there, too. The old Herzog place 
down there, I think at times had been farmed a

17:41.147 --> 17:48.994
little back in there. But it's up this side of 
Thompson That's where we lived in 1913. I was a

17:55.722 --> 17:59.247
baby. Have y'all lived in, I mean, y'all, where all 
have y'all lived, you know, like since y'all got

17:59.267 --> 18:04.595
married? Have y'all lived in Richmond? Richmond, 
Rosenberg for a little, for about a year, not a

18:06.097 --> 18:11.946
year, not quite a year. Just about a year. We've 
lived here ever since. 44 years in Richmond. Not in

18:19.477 --> 18:20.699
this house, right? Lived in it 38. Some years. 
Let's see, 1941, 33 years last September.

18:30.820 --> 18:32.682
And what all have you done? I mean, places like, as 
your career, like if you just started, did you just

18:32.702 --> 18:41.814
start working at Gulf Coast in 58 on tax 
assessment? No. I started out with Houston

18:42.475 --> 18:49.985
Lighting and Power Company after I finished high 
school. Then I married. And we had stopped, and we

18:52.107 --> 18:56.674
had three children. And then I went to work in the 
courthouse, the tax collector. And then when the

19:04.886 --> 19:08.451
war came along, I worked. I was chief clerk of the 
draft board for five years. And then after the war

19:12.497 --> 19:21.270
was over, but before the end of the draft office, I 
quit and went back to the tax collector's office.

19:22.550 --> 19:28.397
Okay, what changes did you notice, like, during 
the war when, like, most of the men were away? Did

19:29.538 --> 19:43.074
this community become more dependent on the, for 
instance, like the women, did they take over the

19:29.538 --> 19:43.074
stores and most of the businesses, or did, you 
know, like, was it just most of the young men that

19:29.538 --> 19:43.074
went? Most of the young men. Mostly young men. We 
didn't have Well, of course, to begin with, your

19:47.693 --> 19:52.698
age limit was 38, but you didn't draft them up to 38. 
They could volunteer, but 26 was about as high as we

19:53.779 --> 20:06.652
drafted, unless they had had deferments for some 
reason or other which put them past that age. No,

20:08.995 --> 20:14.140
there were enough men here to run things, and 
then... Of course, a lot of people went to Houston

20:15.014 --> 20:26.373
to work because of, well, they made parts for ships 
and boilers for ships, and I don't know what all, in

20:15.014 --> 20:26.373
Houston during the war. And a lot of people, that's 
when they began commuting. But Richmond started

20:31.021 --> 20:33.966
to grow right after the war, right? Yes, the whole 
area started to grow. Okay. I wouldn't say right

20:41.963 --> 20:45.949
after, because for a little while, it was hard to 
get materials. But as soon as things became

20:45.990 --> 20:49.495
available, yes, it began to grow. So I guess that 
covers everything. You have anything else to say

20:59.772 --> 21:02.917
or think of? Well, we've seen lots of changes. 
paved streets when they used to be so muddy, you'd

21:09.233 --> 21:23.268
get bogged down in Rosenberg, so sandy you'd get 
stuck in the sand over here in Spots, and air

21:09.233 --> 21:23.268
conditioning and all these things, and better 
cars. We've seen a lot of things change. When they

21:25.310 --> 21:37.063
got natural gas in here, they got running water, 
hot water, and you see Richmond

21:39.608 --> 21:49.819
Talk about these streets, Richmond sitting on 
Sandy, this main part of town, where there's

21:39.608 --> 21:49.819
nothing but sand. And the streets, when it was dry, 
when the sand blew and the buggy wheels kind of

21:52.142 --> 22:03.675
bogged up in that sand, So they went down on the 
river and dug up a bunch of clay and all, and then put

22:05.866 --> 22:13.873
clay on the streets to get out of the sand. Well, 
then when it rained, it got snow and muddy. So then

22:19.498 --> 22:32.089
they bought gravel and had it shipped in here and 
graveled the streets with big old rocks, a lot of

22:19.498 --> 22:32.089
it, like this. And then they'd get graveled up over 
in Colorado County. And finally, then, to get away

22:36.815 --> 22:43.863
from the rocks were the blacktop streets. That's 
where we are now. We have a very active library here

22:45.705 --> 22:51.832
now, a museum, I mean. And that little house 
between the bridges down here, you know, your east

22:52.613 --> 22:58.080
and westbound bridges? Yes, ma'am. The 
handworks? That little antique shop? Well, it's

23:01.764 --> 23:02.985
the handworks. It's for arts and crafts. and go 
down and take courses in various arts and crafts

23:05.114 --> 23:12.403
and some of them old. That was Carrie Nation's 
daughter's home. Carrie Nation. Carrie Nation's

23:20.134 --> 23:24.359
the woman with the axe that went around breaking up 
the saloons. Yeah, yeah. Remember? That's her.

23:25.821 --> 23:26.762
During Prohibition. Right. Was she from here? The 
daughter lived here in that house, and Carrie

23:29.819 --> 23:35.805
Nation spent much of her time with her in that 
house. Where did she go around breaking? Wherever

23:38.508 --> 23:39.829
there was a saloon. Was it here in Texas she broke up 
the saloon? Not just Fort Bend County or Richmond,

23:44.755 --> 23:55.446
but she went up north or anywhere and chopped up the 
board with a hatchet. She was a character. Talking

24:00.278 --> 24:08.431
about prohibition, was there a lot of bootlegging 
and bathtub liquor and all that, bathtub gin that

24:00.278 --> 24:08.431
went on right here? Joe can tell you more about that 
than I. There wasn't much whiskey cooking in this

24:10.735 --> 24:21.713
county as there was anywhere else in Texas, I 
imagine.

24:25.979 --> 24:39.112
I used to think the only way a farmer could live on a 
booth estate and farm was to be able to cook good

24:25.979 --> 24:39.112
whiskey.

24:39.132 --> 24:46.839
Yeah, I had a filling station out here where Melvin 
Lindeman's garage is. Yes, sir. And that catacomb

24:49.542 --> 24:54.687
across the street over there was another filling 
station. where that 66 is now, the Davis Park?

24:57.997 --> 24:58.638
Davis Park. Where the Davis Park on that corner. 
Yes, sir. In fact, the driveway of the filling

25:02.861 --> 25:11.489
station was built up, was blocked up where that 
water could run through there, you know. And I had a

25:13.071 --> 25:23.020
sort of a shop there in the back of the station back 
in, And then no mechanic in it or anything. I just

25:31.344 --> 25:35.749
kept it more or less for storage or what have you. 
But there was room enough to get four-file cars in

25:36.530 --> 25:40.936
there. I went out there to open up one morning, and 
there's Italians over there in the driveway over

25:43.218 --> 25:52.149
at the other station. They hadn't opened up. These 
guys had a modulated Ford truck, stake bed on it,

25:54.944 --> 26:01.351
tarp on it. Well, I knew who it was. Running 
whiskey, bringing whiskey from down there in the

26:07.138 --> 26:11.262
bottom going to Houston.

26:14.466 --> 26:17.429
And they wanted to, they traded over there. They 
never did trade with me. And old Bert Ansel was

26:20.973 --> 26:23.736
running that station. He come down in the morning 
and wanted to store that truck, and he didn't have

26:25.488 --> 26:31.136
any place for him to put it. So they come over, come 
over to see me and want to know if I had room in that

26:32.679 --> 26:39.308
storage out here. I had room in that storage. Well, 
they might leave it a day, might leave it two or

26:44.857 --> 26:49.484
three days. So... They took off. They drove a truck 
in there and took off. I knew they had a load of

27:00.079 --> 27:01.881
whiskey. I got up and looked under the tarp and see 
what size kegs they had. Went down. My

27:13.897 --> 27:17.101
brother-in-law was running a meat market down 
there. I went down there and asked him if he had a

27:17.121 --> 27:22.528
place to put some whiskey. when he just got a bunch 
of, filled his barn up with cotton seed hulls over

27:23.842 --> 27:32.375
there. And so we went down. It so happened there 
wasn't very many new kegs in town.

27:42.250 --> 27:51.705
And we got ahold of three kegs, took them out there 
and filled them up with water and put them on that

27:42.250 --> 27:51.705
truck. Took three of them kegs of whiskey off the 
floor of that

27:51.972 --> 28:00.880
cedar house. Come back here at noon, I saw them 
dollar and a half store in the

28:00.900 --> 28:09.869
truck. You know, I didn't know about that. I'm 
learning things. Some of their customers, some of

28:13.332 --> 28:20.019
their customers somewhere down the line, I 
imagine, was a little unhappy. I imagine so.
