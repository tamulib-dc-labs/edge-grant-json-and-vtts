00:05.009 --> 00:06.310
Out of 15 seconds? No.

00:11.875 --> 00:23.346
When you see Tex at Treadwell, I'll tell him I said, 
hi, boss, because when I was with the National

00:11.875 --> 00:23.346
Oceanographic Data Center, I didn't have a boss. I 
had a 10-agency advisory board, but the Navy had

00:23.686 --> 00:33.615
the administrative overview And Tex and I used to 
wave in our arms at each other and scream and yell.

00:39.549 --> 00:51.104
So when we were out at a reception or if I ever had a 
chance, I would become very differential and say,

00:39.549 --> 00:51.104
yes, boss, no, boss. I miss him. He's a wonderful 
guy. Is there anything you'd like to add to the

00:55.350 --> 00:57.994
interview? Anything you can think of I missed that 
you'd like to put on tape? Excuse me, I have one more

01:01.152 --> 01:03.736
question before I let you do that. There is now talk 
about centralizing research in oceanography

01:04.717 --> 01:11.748
under one agency and one head. What is your opinion 
of that? Well, I don't really know what that means.

01:21.864 --> 01:30.096
I don't know how you could do it to begin with 
because the agencies in the government who have a

01:31.139 --> 01:34.222
mission that involves the ocean. You probably 
could have a monolithic department where you had

01:36.204 --> 01:46.275
geological survey, Bureau of Land Management, 
NOAA. Certainly you couldn't have the Navy, the

01:46.295 --> 01:55.685
Coast Guard,

01:46.295 --> 01:55.685
Fish and Wildlife Service. Then over here you have 
academia. And we have to be very careful there that

01:59.860 --> 02:11.736
we don't try to impose the mission-oriented 
aspects if we're going to keep abreast in

01:59.860 --> 02:11.736
technology. So you have NSF and ONR and Ford 
Foundation and Rockefeller Foundation. And then

02:18.345 --> 02:21.930
these agencies, of course, do. So

02:22.610 --> 02:26.916
I can't envision it. After 30 years in the 
government, I still... I can't envision a

02:30.353 --> 02:39.530
monolithic organization in the marine sciences 
if I understand your question correctly. That's

02:40.953 --> 02:42.175
really all I have. Anything you'd like to add to the 
table? Gosh, no. I'm happy to answer questions.

02:48.366 --> 02:48.767
That's it.
