WEBVTT

00:03.811 --> 00:06.455
And so he was easily aggravated. And so a student 
says, Doc, Dr. Lindsay, should we drive our cars or

00:07.736 --> 00:14.666
some detail? Doc said, that's a detail. Then 
another one shows up his hand, and he says, ask him a

00:19.513 --> 00:26.702
similar type question. I told you that's a detail. 
And that went on, and then he just went, after a

00:28.705 --> 00:33.632
while he just turned around and took off. And they 
said, what happened? The students asked me, what

00:35.940 --> 00:37.944
happened to him? But he was, I remember that real 
clearly. Did any student ever try to play a joke or a

00:44.097 --> 00:48.346
prank on you as a teacher? I don't know that they 
did. No.

00:54.672 --> 01:01.260
I think one time we may have left somebody in the 
classroom asleep, you know, after class or

00:54.672 --> 01:01.260
something like that. Did any student ever try to 
bribe you for a grade or anything like that? No. No.

01:07.848 --> 01:10.972
A lot of them coming around trying to get grades 
raised. That's a common occurrence. I'll tell you

01:12.474 --> 01:16.999
one of the things that you might enjoy was when we 
first let girls in. Old Dick Davidson over there

01:18.421 --> 01:22.806
was counseling one of them, and I happened to walk 
by the door. An old girl was just sitting there just

01:23.984 --> 01:26.346
boo-hooing. And Dr. Davidson looked over and 
said, Here comes Dr. Holland. He'll help you. He

01:33.353 --> 01:36.355
was ready to unload that girl. Did you ever have a 
parent or any other outsider try to twist your arm

01:36.836 --> 01:44.343
on anything? Yeah, I had one student, but he got 
over it. He thought his little brother was sharper

01:46.925 --> 01:53.451
than he was, and we hadn't placed him high enough or 
something, giving him a, tough enough courses,

01:53.650 --> 01:56.695
and it turned out he couldn't even handle what he 
had. The

01:56.755 --> 02:08.556
only problem I had a little, I had the only problem 
with two or three profs, young ones that we hired.

02:08.576 --> 02:12.503
We hired one guy from

02:14.423 --> 02:17.347
He had gone to Switzerland.

02:19.631 --> 02:21.533
What's the capital of that place? Bern. Bern, 
Lucerne, Geneva, Lausanne. I've forgotten which

02:30.206 --> 02:32.029
one it was right now. I don't think we've hit it. 
Anyway, it's a well-known university. And every

02:36.215 --> 02:43.806
one of them that we got out of there, they handled 
their students just so rough that the students

02:36.215 --> 02:43.806
couldn't get along with them. And the students 
couldn't get along with this fellow. And so we had

02:49.516 --> 02:52.198
to let him go. And

02:52.338 --> 02:57.903
since then, he got an appointment over there. And 
he makes a point to always send me a card. We had

03:00.806 --> 03:03.768
another boy, young man, that we got. Came to us from 
MIT, just as sharp as he could be. And you could

03:11.895 --> 03:14.097
write a wonderful letter. But his, and when you 
talk to him, you'd think, this guy is just going to

03:15.680 --> 03:25.134
make an outstanding faculty member. I hired him. 
Well, Toby said, you know, that's the first guy

03:26.997 --> 03:38.774
that we've had that got into a squabble with 
everybody in the entire department, including

03:26.997 --> 03:38.774
all the mechanics downstairs, in less than one 
month. And we had to finally... let him go, and I got

03:41.228 --> 03:43.831
him a job with Bell Labs. I said, you people can 
handle somebody like this. I can't handle him

03:47.015 --> 03:50.879
because he's just too overbearing. He needs a job 
where he put him over in a corner. Another one I'll

03:53.442 --> 03:56.966
tell you is Bokris. I had the opportunity, the 
first opportunity, to hire him. He came in over

04:00.770 --> 04:06.016
there to get me to hire him, and I had this young 
faculty that I had just hired. Most of them were 10

04:06.036 --> 04:09.480
or 15 years younger than I was. And he came in there, 
and he had a list of books that were longer than most

04:10.355 --> 04:18.828
anybody's list of papers. I said, how in the world 
do you do that? He said, well, I just kind of sketch

04:21.812 --> 04:26.379
out a few things, and I get somebody else fill in 
those little details. But I could just tell that

04:27.921 --> 04:30.645
guy was so overbearing. And I decided that I didn't 
care how good he was, that I had to think of the fact

04:31.266 --> 04:38.657
that I had nine or 10 other faculty there. that I 
wanted to develop. And if I had somebody like that,

04:41.150 --> 04:46.519
he would just try to intimidate them and run all 
over them. And so I declined hiring him. I didn't

04:50.104 --> 04:51.326
care how good he was. You've got to look at this 
thing. Are you big enough to hire somebody like

04:53.991 --> 04:56.995
that? If you're real big, you can handle them. But 
if you're no bigger than we were, you just can't

04:59.427 --> 05:03.575
handle somebody that's, I don't care how good he 
is. Well, old Martel hired him. And I saw Martel

05:05.699 --> 05:10.068
later, and he said to me, he says, how in the world 
did you pass up that man? I said, well, I decided we

05:11.270 --> 05:14.256
couldn't work with him over there. So I'm not sure 
what he says now. But anyway, I missed my

05:16.620 --> 05:21.570
opportunity there. Let's see, one of the people I 
forgot to ask about, and if we, this is a note to the

05:22.158 --> 05:34.405
typist that moved this back up to where we were 
talking about other administrators, Dick

05:22.158 --> 05:34.405
Winerdi. Oh, he was really a good one. Dick... I 
gave him a departmental position as professor

05:39.353 --> 05:46.805
because he couldn't get anybody else to take him 
on. He wanted to teach this little course in

05:46.825 --> 05:49.309
activation analysis. So I made him a professor of 
chemical engineering. And he was over in the

05:53.016 --> 05:55.159
dean's office all the time. And so after he went 
with Calhoun, I've forgotten. He jumped me about

06:04.391 --> 06:06.738
something. I wrote some letter to him that just 
really had a twist in it. And I sent a copy of it to

06:11.252 --> 06:13.680
Fred. And he called me up and he said, boy, that just 
tickled the life out of me. He said, but you know, I

06:18.266 --> 06:21.489
don't understand Wayne Erdy. When he was working 
for me, I just didn't have any problem with him, but

06:21.609 --> 06:27.555
he's giving me a lot of problems now. And he said, I 
can't understand that. And I said, well, what the

06:28.856 --> 06:30.318
problem is now? He used to be working for you. He's 
working for John Gavilan now. But the funny one was

06:35.082 --> 06:43.110
that when he got two different occasions, when... 
He was already out in the industry, and he called

06:43.985 --> 06:47.371
me. You can tell what's coming. He says, Charlie, 
being on the department staff of chemical

06:50.556 --> 06:58.410
engineering was one of the highest honors that 
I've ever had. I said, my boy wants to get into

06:58.430 --> 07:01.976
graduate school. Could you help me?

07:07.238 --> 07:15.895
Then another one was whenever he finally got 
crosswise over there and he was looking for a home,

07:07.238 --> 07:15.895
I thought we were going to get him back because he 
was on my faculty. And so he was calling up wanting

07:16.016 --> 07:20.725
to come back. That's right, when Dr. Miller became 
president. He'd been crosswise with some of

07:25.235 --> 07:27.997
those. See, Dick and I had offices that adjoined 
each other, and the first three days that Dr.

07:28.338 --> 07:36.586
Miller was president, he didn't even say good 
morning to Dick. He literally did not say a word to

07:36.927 --> 07:38.769
him. Dick came into my office and said to me 
tersely, he said, I've got to find some work

07:39.510 --> 07:44.755
somewhere. Well, he called me, and I told him, 
well, you know, we'll try to use you. Come on over,

07:50.026 --> 07:52.369
because I knew we were obligated to. Now, when he 
was working for Dean Benson, what was his task?

08:01.639 --> 08:03.901
When he was still in engineering, what was his 
task? Oh, I think he had him doing, Fred put more

08:04.822 --> 08:09.527
stock in what he told him than I would have. He kind 
of had Fred buffaloed a little bit. Fred would kind

08:12.394 --> 08:14.859
of fall for some of that. Was he to try to bring in 
research money? Well, he was involved in a lot of

08:19.206 --> 08:27.381
the, it was more in research than anything else.

08:28.255 --> 08:30.420
But he got stuck on him and Newell both. And I could 
tell Newell was no good the day that he came in when

08:30.760 --> 08:35.390
he was looking for a job. And I made a couple 
suggestions to him, and he just brushed them off.

08:39.279 --> 08:43.488
And I could tell that he wasn't going to make it. But 
Fred did. go along with him quite a while. He was

08:51.594 --> 08:54.880
subject to being sucked in a little bit. Wayne Erdy 
had that activation analysis. He didn't have it

08:58.346 --> 09:02.574
down where he could, I've forgotten, Paul 
Crawford used to laugh about. He was looking, he

09:03.796 --> 09:12.792
had his system fixed so he could shove these 
samples kind of like J.C. Penney's all over the

09:03.796 --> 09:12.792
place. but he couldn't find silicon in 
carborundum, which is made out of silicon.

09:22.468 --> 09:23.731
He got in a cart for the horse. Back to... Joyous 
pleasures of being the department head. What are

09:31.831 --> 09:38.239
some other achievements that you remember during 
those years that you're proud to look back on? You

09:38.580 --> 09:40.602
said teaching was the biggest. Well, I've got a lot 
of books published. I've got seven books

09:43.085 --> 09:48.592
published, and I've got a lot of them in 
distillation, kinetics, catalysis. In 93, I

09:48.652 --> 09:54.760
wrote one on quantitative cancer modeling and 
risk assessment with Silken, who's a

09:48.652 --> 09:54.760
statistician. And so I enjoy very much the 
development of ideas on paper. And see, when I

10:04.089 --> 10:09.837
became department head, I realized that I didn't 
have time to be down in that lab working all the

10:04.089 --> 10:09.837
time. I just couldn't do it. And so what I did do was 
get into this other field, and I got started with

10:11.940 --> 10:24.156
Exxon down there in 1955 because I had, from a 
master's degree, had worked with Phil Murdoch

10:11.940 --> 10:24.156
on... on algebraic solution of very simple 
distillation problems and there's just three or

10:24.794 --> 10:50.633
four components and I got down there and OB 
Franklin said well since you're an expert on

10:24.794 --> 10:50.633
distillation we're going to let you work out this 
uh... this big old tower uh... pipe still and it had

10:24.794 --> 10:50.633
about thirty forty plates and probably five 
hundred components and uh... streams going off

10:24.794 --> 10:50.633
everywhere and actually In the way we were looking 
at them, when you're doing finite differences,

10:50.613 --> 10:57.498
every time you come to a terminal condition, 
you've got another set of boundary conditions. So

10:58.923 --> 11:00.067
they gave me that problem. And I just walked around 
for about two weeks trying to figure out how in the

11:03.185 --> 11:06.729
world, I can't even solve that little one. How in 
the world can I solve anything like this? So I

11:08.912 --> 11:14.058
finally found out a way to do it, and that's what got 
me started on all this other stuff. And they

11:14.078 --> 11:18.703
eventually were the first ones to develop a 
program on it, which we call the theta method. And

11:19.544 --> 11:23.168
it is still a real good method, and it has some 
theoretical basis. And then I wrote a book on

11:24.049 --> 11:30.036
kinetics, And it's still being used over there. 
The one on kinetics is used, and also we're using

11:33.374 --> 11:37.605
the one on distillation. So those two books are 
still in use. What were your guidelines for being a

11:42.457 --> 11:45.645
good department head?

11:50.620 --> 11:51.321
Oh, I don't know. I just tried to treat everybody 
fair. That was all. Just kind of treat them like

11:54.366 --> 11:58.492
you'd like to be treated yourself. As near as you 
can. And it's hard to do that, but to not have any,

11:59.514 --> 12:07.646
uh, be favoritism over one or the other. Try to have 
an open door to any of them that had any problem.

12:14.717 --> 12:15.278
And, uh, and have some concern, it's very 
difficult, but that's what I tried to do, and tried

12:16.928 --> 12:31.951
to help them as much as I could with what helped them 
advance their own careers. And you obviously had

12:31.971 --> 12:35.396
some graduate students. Which are the graduate 
students you're most proud to claim?

12:46.426 --> 12:50.010
Let's see, there are several of them that have done 
real well. Norman Tetlow was one of them who went to

12:51.811 --> 12:56.576
Dow that developed the whole design package for 
them. And Ron McDaniel was also with him down

12:57.958 --> 13:01.581
there. And then Narker, I don't know, he was a 
graduate student, worked over at the center some.

13:10.490 --> 13:11.231
Another good one. I've had a lot of good graduate 
students.

13:16.767 --> 13:41.661
so and some of them very very good in fact I had two 
Dan Taylor and Park Davis that both went to Rice and

13:16.767 --> 13:41.661
I got them as graduate students and they also 
worked with took some courses under Dr. Kleppel he

13:16.767 --> 13:41.661
said that they were two of the best mathematical 
minds that he had seen come through from

13:16.767 --> 13:41.661
engineering that they just they could handle it, 
and they were good students. With what other

13:46.862 --> 13:51.387
institutions did you most closely cooperate? Oh, 
I did some with the University of Texas, but not

13:52.088 --> 14:13.032
anything in real detail, but Ben Winkle over there 
was, he worked in distillation, but he did more of

13:52.088 --> 14:13.032
the experimental work, and I was, I'd gotten off 
into the other design, it's really design

13:52.088 --> 14:13.032
methods, I'd gotten into that because That's all a 
department head's got time to do. And also with

14:16.865 --> 14:30.582
Bill Akers down at Rice, you may have known of him, 
he was, he went to Tech and later went on and got his

14:16.865 --> 14:30.582
degree at Rice and stayed down there with the 
administration for a good long while. As the

14:31.103 --> 14:40.335
enrollment at A&M began to change, women were 
admitted, corps became volunteer and so forth,

14:31.103 --> 14:40.335
did that, how did that affect the department? The 
only thing that affected us was whenever the

14:41.868 --> 14:53.923
enrollment got away, and we just were looking at 
the possibility of having to run labs night and day

14:41.868 --> 14:53.923
and all that kind of thing. That was the only thing, 
and that kind of came to an end, and we didn't have

14:53.943 --> 14:59.269
the space for it. But other than that, I'd say that 
over the years that the students, I think they've

15:01.312 --> 15:06.698
really gotten better. I've got a real excellent 
class right now, I remember when I first started

15:11.416 --> 15:22.704
teaching, there was a tendency for students to 
think, well, by the time we get to be seniors, we've

15:11.416 --> 15:22.704
already got the fundamental knowledge. All we're 
gonna do from here on is think. solve problems but

15:26.114 --> 15:44.560
they didn't have it all and then if you gave them 
something new and said well we haven't had that you

15:26.114 --> 15:44.560
know as if that weren't fair territory but the 
students now just take it anything comes out of

15:26.114 --> 15:44.560
them. Do you think that the courses that you and 
your colleagues teach now are more demanding Oh,

15:49.992 --> 15:51.113
yeah, they are. And they're higher quality. 
Actually, I was disappointed when I got my degree

15:54.637 --> 16:04.127
in chemical engineering because I'd had a pretty 
good background in mathematics and science, and

15:54.637 --> 16:04.127
they weren't using it. They were just using mainly 
arithmetic. And they made it hard, but just giving

16:06.810 --> 16:10.715
you catchy problems. That's why they kept the 
grades down. But the material they really covered

16:13.758 --> 16:18.463
wasn't really all that hard, the fundamentals. 
Another thing we had was open book, which

16:18.764 --> 16:33.446
encouraged you not to do anything, which is not 
near as good as thinking that you're going to have

16:18.764 --> 16:33.446
to go in there and have it all in your mind so that you 
can spend your time working the problem instead of

16:18.764 --> 16:33.446
thumbing through the book. And when you give open 
book quizzes, what happens is that you give

16:34.067 --> 16:39.115
something they can't find in there anyway. And so I 
think it's better. After that, I never did give

16:41.458 --> 16:44.643
open book quizzes. I just felt like that. You can, 
students will do better if they have to, there's

16:46.743 --> 16:55.221
certain tools that you're gonna have to learn 
regardless, and just well learn them. It may be

16:55.883 --> 17:07.367
drudgery, but there's certain, a carpenter's got 
to have a hammer and a saw, and if you're gonna do any

16:55.883 --> 17:07.367
good, you need certain fundamentals that you 
understand thoroughly, and you don't have to be

16:55.883 --> 17:07.367
looking them up. As women began to be in the 
classroom, did y'all have any examples of where

17:08.258 --> 17:21.921
somebody forgot that he was speaking now to a mixed 
audience and said something? I don't know, but I

17:21.941 --> 17:28.512
got one of these reports back once, and I could 
never figure out what I had done that was sexy or

17:21.941 --> 17:28.512
something. And that baffled me. I've never been 
called on it but once, but I don't know what it was.

17:34.147 --> 17:38.612
It must have been somebody gave a poor grade, 
because I've never been called on it before. And I

17:38.812 --> 17:41.955
never tell anything in class that's off color. The 
only thing that I did tell,

17:43.958 --> 17:55.090
I did show them a film that I had, some slides that I 
had made. And that might have been, that's the only

17:55.863 --> 17:58.025
thing I could figure. I was teaching a course on 
quantitative cancer modeling and risk

17:58.045 --> 18:01.129
assessment. And going back, and I was giving a 
little bit on waste disposal. The first garbage

18:09.718 --> 18:17.046
disposal place was right outside of Jerusalem. 
It's the Greek name now that's for hell. It means

18:22.432 --> 18:24.334
the same thing, it was a mess. And that was one of the 
things I pointed out. But before I did that, I went

18:28.998 --> 18:44.500
back and pointed out that probably hazardous

18:28.998 --> 18:44.500
waste incineration or incineration began about 
500,000 years ago. And what I had was I got somebody

18:44.935 --> 18:56.565
to draw me this cartoon, and it showed these women 
were lugging the wood, throwing it on the fire, and

18:44.935 --> 18:56.565
the men were all sitting back watching them. And I 
said, boy, in those days, men had it made. And

18:58.987 --> 19:07.034
that's the only thing that I can figure out that I 
might have said that I never did know what it was. In

19:08.034 --> 19:14.740
general, I'll tell you, the girls, what will 
happen is only the good ones will stay in. The poor

19:15.513 --> 19:18.538
ones that see they can't make it, they're not like 
the boys. The poor ones will drop out and go take

19:18.738 --> 19:21.722
another major. You've got some boys that will stay 
in there until the bitter end. And that's the

19:26.189 --> 19:27.872
difference you see. Usually the girls are near the 
top of the class. As far as you and your colleagues

19:32.899 --> 19:40.170
knew, was chemical engineering one of the most 
demanding majors on the campus? Well, I think

19:40.927 --> 19:44.191
electrical was real demanding. I think chemical, 
electrical, and mechanical was fairly

19:44.592 --> 19:48.657
demanding. Those three were pretty demanding. 
I'd say electrical may be. Electrical and

19:52.883 --> 19:58.271
chemical were probably two of the most demanding, 
and I don't know. I imagine it would depend on your

19:58.291 --> 20:03.778
aptitude as to which you would think would be the 
most demanding. That reminds me to go way back to

20:04.838 --> 20:09.306
the early 60s again. As you and I and others were 
part of that committee recommending the new name

20:09.346 --> 20:23.573
for this institution, did you and your colleagues 
in engineering have a preference for what the name

20:09.346 --> 20:23.573
ought to be or ought not to be? You know, I haven't 
thought about it since then.

20:28.705 --> 20:29.629
No, I don't really. I don't know that at that time 
that we would have gone with Texas A&M University,

20:30.010 --> 20:34.947
though. As I understand from Vice President, then 
Vice President Hall, he said that Mr. Rutter could

20:36.074 --> 20:48.268
not at all accept losing the A&M. And that our 
committee, you remember, recommended Texas

20:49.289 --> 20:52.613
State University. Because everybody else was 
going that way. And he said Mr. Rutter just didn't

20:54.515 --> 20:56.998
like that at all. And Dr. Hall said he's the one that 
came up with what it now is, the A&M with no periods

20:57.018 --> 21:04.647
and so forth. And As I look back, okay, everybody 
knows what school it is. It doesn't mean that

21:09.313 --> 21:11.195
anymore. No, that's right. So I think it was a good 
deal going there. That's what I'm saying, is it

21:14.920 --> 21:18.364
doesn't hurt to be different. Right. When did we 
begin to get large numbers of international

21:21.147 --> 21:25.673
students in engineering?

21:28.133 --> 21:41.451
Well, we started getting them way back there in the 
60s some, and I would not, I was trying to, at one

21:28.133 --> 21:41.451
time, we had some pressure on us to not have more 
than 30% in engineering graduate students. And I

21:42.325 --> 21:43.687
kept mine down. And I tried to keep them down. We 
could have had a bigger class of graduate

21:46.570 --> 21:48.933
students. And one of the things that we did to try to 
attract others was take these that had finished

21:49.894 --> 22:03.710
with a four-year degree in science from some of 
these teaching colleges and get them in, give them

21:49.894 --> 22:03.710
a fast course. But that's when it started. And now 
there's just probably no holes barred. You can

22:11.415 --> 22:12.796
have any number you want to. There was some concern 
that the legislature would be concerned about us

22:13.156 --> 22:18.641
educating so many foreign students. And that 
prevailed a long time through engineering over

22:18.661 --> 22:23.965
there. And we did keep ours down. What would be your 
evaluation of the quality of the international

22:27.228 --> 22:33.113
students, the academic ability? Oh, I think 
they're good.

22:37.237 --> 22:57.169
But another thing that I think is that they are 
going to be the leaders unless we, I think that we

22:37.237 --> 22:57.169
might want to give some favoritism to ours, 
because what's happening to our own students now

22:37.237 --> 22:57.169
is that they can get a good salary when they get the 
BS degree, so they're going out and taking that

22:37.237 --> 22:57.169
job. And I'm not so sure about what, there's 
nothing wrong with being, showing favoritism

22:58.027 --> 23:21.670
over your own national people that we shouldn't be 
able to give ours enough stipend more to attract a

22:58.027 --> 23:21.670
lot of good American students because they're the 
ones, a lot of those are gonna end up as director of

22:58.027 --> 23:21.670
your research, head of your chemical engineering 
departments throughout the country. And so we

23:22.571 --> 23:26.194
ought to be doing more to attract those people. and 
uh that it is we all have them all on the same part and

23:27.153 --> 23:50.140
generally that's correct if they're all citizens 
but if they're not citizens we don't have to do that

23:27.153 --> 23:50.140
and i think for our own good we need to we need to get 
some that are some of our own in in line all right

23:27.153 --> 23:50.140
i've now just anointed you as the advisor to 
chemical engineering, planning the future, and

23:51.706 --> 23:56.650
then to engineering. What advice would you give to 
your department and to your college colleagues as

23:56.931 --> 24:03.036
they look to the future? Well, we did a big study, 
and I had all industry helping me on this. And one of

24:08.081 --> 24:18.090
the things that we came up with was what they needed 
to start looking at was to make sure that these

24:08.081 --> 24:18.090
students have a better, rounded education. 
Chemistry are only taking about 10 hours. Above

24:23.127 --> 24:32.539
the bachelor for the PhD, the classroom is one of 
the best places to pick up and to learn another

24:23.127 --> 24:32.539
discipline. And what we need is people that are 
broadly trained, and they can even have some

24:32.719 --> 24:37.746
business. And this is not giving up the English and 
this sort of stuff. I had a guy that taught me

24:41.551 --> 24:45.456
British prose and anthology. And he at one time 
taught mathematics, and he said, I told Dr. Moore,

24:45.959 --> 24:54.029
who was president at that time, that I could not 
teach mathematics anymore because I started

24:45.959 --> 24:54.029
reading that poem. And the Assyrians swept down. 
He said, that just took me. But I think they should

24:58.836 --> 25:00.618
be... The classic, the well-educated man today 
really should be one that has some experience in

25:01.499 --> 25:09.730
the mathematics and the sciences and English. And 
I think that's college-wide. But also, he should

25:13.054 --> 25:15.257
have some... some in the arts and sciences so that 
he knows where everything came from, the history

25:15.592 --> 25:26.569
of all of it. And what I think we need to do is get back 
to having chemical engineering students take

25:33.361 --> 25:47.641
their math in the math department and get them 
interested in teaching some courses that are not

25:33.361 --> 25:47.641
all just theoretical mathematics but some 
applied mathematics for the engineers, the

25:33.361 --> 25:47.641
chemists, and all these other people. You should 
be taking courses and we should have some students

25:47.661 --> 25:56.533
taking some courses in physics and mathematics 
and

25:58.353 --> 26:10.671
And we don't do that because what is going to 
happen, and even business, because what's going

25:58.353 --> 26:10.671
to happen is that things are changing so fast that 
you don't have time for somebody to come up on the

25:58.353 --> 26:10.671
curve anymore. You've got to have people well 
enough, broad enough trained that we can go from

26:10.691 --> 26:20.766
one project to another and he still doesn't have 
such a long learning curve. And I think that this

26:21.742 --> 26:26.808
was their feeling, that we've been going in the 
wrong direction. And right now the legislature is

26:26.948 --> 26:31.152
still trying to make you take fewer hours and 
everything. The best place to learn something is

26:31.913 --> 26:34.396
in the classroom. It's the most efficient way. And 
that's what I would say is let's turn out some

26:36.398 --> 26:45.488
really well-educated, well-rounded that have 
had some courses in all these other departments.

26:46.565 --> 26:52.131
So that, and it's not just in engineering, it's all 
in the arts and sciences. And I enjoyed, look back

26:52.371 --> 27:01.101
over it, I enjoyed some of those courses that I had 
outside the department far more than I did some of

26:52.371 --> 27:01.101
them I had inside. The one I had in British 
prosanthology, I wouldn't take anything for that

27:02.643 --> 27:07.708
course.

27:08.950 --> 27:11.012
And it depends on the teachers. You've got to have 
real good teachers dedicated to teach those

27:11.032 --> 27:14.496
courses. And so that's what I would, that's what 
it's going to take because what they've come up

27:15.488 --> 27:26.651
with the concept is that we are now in the age of a 
learning society. And the B1 and most nations are

27:27.793 --> 27:36.130
going to adopt this concept because they found out 
that's the only way that they can keep the

27:36.987 --> 27:45.234
competitive edge on their competitors or stay 
ahead of them is by learning technology faster

27:36.987 --> 27:45.234
than they do. And to learn it faster, you've got to 
have a broad background so you can switch from one

27:45.254 --> 27:51.780
technology to another and pick it up. And so I would 
say that that would be, they'd all be well served to

27:52.681 --> 28:05.172
start looking at teaching more courses and over a 
broader scope. But now none of these students take

28:06.721 --> 28:08.984
courses outside. I mentioned already to you how 
many I took outside the department. Then I went

28:12.328 --> 28:17.896
over after I got my PhD and took all the courses that 
they offered in the math department on top of it. So

28:17.976 --> 28:26.407
this is the direction we ought to go in so that they 
can switch fields. See, I wrote this book on

28:27.508 --> 28:31.293
quantitative cancer model and risk assessment 
statistics. And I never had a course in it, but I had

28:31.314 --> 28:33.977
enough mathematics that I could work with silken 
and try to figure it out, but I wrote it so that

28:34.244 --> 28:38.695
engineers could read it. In terms of the 
department's leadership, should it be a

28:40.881 --> 28:46.836
department head or a department chairman?

28:49.381 --> 28:55.548
Oh, I think a department head, I think you need more 
of a line organization. And I'm not sure that the

28:56.289 --> 29:11.267
terms ought to be so limited because if you get to 
putting so much emphasis on just being a professor

28:56.289 --> 29:11.267
and doing research, the guy says, hell, I'll take 
it for four years and I'm not going to bust my butt

28:56.289 --> 29:11.267
because it's not going to have anything to do with 
where I'm going. I'll take it and get mine done and

29:11.948 --> 29:14.811
then somebody else can have it. I think that's a 
tendency in chairmanships. And I was using the

29:17.461 --> 29:25.202
term chairman also to mean that the chairman is 
bound by the majority vote. Yeah. I don't think

29:27.047 --> 29:28.511
that's a good way to run it. I usually would try to, 
every once in a while you're not going to Well,

29:32.969 --> 29:40.801
first of all, you should be convincing people that 
this is the direction to go in, that you don't even

29:32.969 --> 29:40.801
really have to vote. You can just look and see what 
the consensus is and decide what to do. And so, no, I

29:45.468 --> 29:52.839
think it still has to be a leadership position. And 
when you get these others, you don't really have

29:53.581 --> 29:57.026
the leadership in there that you need. People 
don't really feel responsible for it. And I found

30:00.374 --> 30:04.261
this out running the laboratories. I had to get 
somebody permanently in charge of them because if

30:04.341 --> 30:09.470
you didn't, they just went downhill. One guy would 
come in, and he'd be in charge of it, and he wouldn't

30:09.510 --> 30:17.104
fix anything because I'm just going to have it this 
semester. Somebody else got it after that. Who

30:19.358 --> 30:28.951
were the key people in your departmental office 
and other staff folks that deserve a pat on the back

30:19.358 --> 30:28.951
for their fine work? Well, actually, Wanda Greer 
was the one that stayed with me the longest and

30:28.971 --> 30:35.039
probably helped me the most. I used to run through 
them about one a year until I got a hold of her. Now,

30:39.124 --> 30:40.606
that's the wife of? John. She's from Port Arthur, 
where you are, and knows you. She did a real good job

30:45.592 --> 30:49.037
because she had good judgment. Mm-hmm. And also 
was good at reading anything I wrote and telling me

30:49.480 --> 30:53.788
what was wrong. And she worked with me long enough 
that she didn't mind telling me when she thought I

30:53.868 --> 30:58.917
was wrong and did. And so that's worth a lot to get 
somebody that knows the ropes and will just take it

30:59.699 --> 31:07.113
and run with it. All right.
