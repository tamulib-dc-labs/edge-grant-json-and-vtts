WEBVTT

00:01.533 --> 00:30.932
the minority started developing a fairly strong 
political say and their feeling was you're trying

00:01.533 --> 00:30.932
to break up this little political concentration 
of power we're getting the traumatic thing was

00:01.533 --> 00:30.932
when I had to debate on television with this man who 
had threatened the lives of major HUD officials

00:01.533 --> 00:30.932
and debate the plan but because we understood that 
you don't dictate local policy from Washington

00:01.533 --> 00:30.932
you know to local government in Texas, we had 
structured a program that basically allowed more

00:31.216 --> 00:40.287
options without requiring a whole bunch of 
things. Basically, we said, first of all, you find

00:40.668 --> 00:43.731
housing for everybody. Then you worry about 
letting people live exactly where they want to.

00:47.997 --> 00:49.939
And those that want to should be able to move. And 
those that don't want to shouldn't have to. Was

00:52.442 --> 00:57.308
there a perception, too, that they wanted the 
Allen Parkway for the expansion of the CBD? Alan

00:57.794 --> 01:00.759
Parkway really wasn't involved in any of this. It 
wasn't even an issue. I see. The issue, at least

01:03.262 --> 01:08.971
from Washington, was how do you disperse people? 
And Alan Parkway at that time was a given, and our

01:08.991 --> 01:16.723
bottom line was there simply didn't begin to be 
enough public housing. So debating, closing one

01:16.803 --> 01:21.570
down, just simply wasn't an issue. What year was 
this? This was, I believe, in 79 and 80. maybe 88 and

01:27.207 --> 01:28.609
1. This was part of the whole federal

01:28.869 --> 01:37.098
concept of regional fair share in housing. Yeah. 
They called it the Regional Housing Mobility

01:37.378 --> 01:40.481
Program. And those were the old days of the area 
wide housing opportunity plans where you would

01:40.862 --> 01:48.970
tell a community how many units they were going to 
take and so forth. Yeah, it was an attempt to

01:48.990 --> 01:51.493
homogenize the entire region. Or an attempt to get 
the region operating as a whole. We never wound up,

01:56.057 --> 02:00.901
though we discussed at length, the idea of doing 
one of these plans. We decided that that was not in

02:01.021 --> 02:05.845
the best interests of this particular area. 
Political dynamism. Exactly, exactly. And there

02:09.369 --> 02:14.974
were no guarantees that, in fact, you would get 
this extra money. Yeah, in fact, several COGs

02:15.034 --> 02:22.020
found themselves threatened with nonexistence 
if they went ahead with such a program. That was one

02:22.793 --> 02:35.344
of the times I felt very proud of the way we pursued 
something because there was some interest

02:22.793 --> 02:35.344
stirred up by outsiders in our doing it because 
some of the small communities perceived they

02:22.793 --> 02:35.344
might get some more money. And I went to 
Washington. We developed a great many materials.

02:41.230 --> 02:43.352
I just said, okay, here are the facts. You know, 
we're not going to suggest how you decide this, but

02:43.712 --> 02:50.218
here are the pros, here are the cons, here's the way 
it would work. And we had really quite a large

02:50.722 --> 02:53.325
public debate. We had several different public 
hearings and public meetings where we had

02:53.386 --> 03:00.615
officials from HUD down and just answered 
questions. And all of this took place well before

03:01.256 --> 03:04.961
any kind of a decision needed to be made. And the 
final decision was that this was not something to

03:05.181 --> 03:09.347
pursue at this time. At any rate, what it- There was 
no mandate for HUD to do it. No, they would have

03:15.235 --> 03:18.619
liked to, but they They talked about a mandate, and 
then for all practical purposes, HUD went away as

03:19.190 --> 03:25.259
far as regional councils were concerned. When 
they stopped giving 701 money, that was sort of the

03:25.279 --> 03:29.445
end of it. Nor took you long nor long. Exactly. In my 
mind, that was then the beginning of the growth of

03:32.290 --> 03:43.847
regional councils in terms of HGAC, which is sort 
of the only one I can speak to. Because when there

03:44.350 --> 03:54.286
was no longer federal money that suggested you do 
this program or that program, the programs then

03:44.350 --> 03:54.286
had to be structured by what the board was willing 
to put local money in. And so then the local money

03:54.967 --> 04:05.384
started going to address things that they saw as 
problems, particularly problems that were

03:54.967 --> 04:05.384
interjurisdictional.

04:05.404 --> 04:11.674
I think the high point of the evolution of this was 
the solid waste, the regional solid waste plan

04:05.404 --> 04:11.674
that we did. One of our county judges came to the 
board one day, and he said, we have a real problem in

04:12.312 --> 04:17.577
solid waste. City of Houston's contract is trying 
to put a landfill in our community. We don't have a

04:22.982 --> 04:25.665
place to put our own garbage daily. I am inundated 
by salesmen of different technologies, and I

04:26.125 --> 04:32.471
don't even know how to evaluate those 
technologies. I have a feeling waste to energy

04:32.952 --> 04:35.434
might be a good idea. I don't even know how to begin 
to go about it, evaluating whether it's a good

04:35.494 --> 04:39.838
idea. HGAC, you need to do something. It took us 
probably close to a year working with a committee

04:43.837 --> 04:53.268
of the board, all elected officials, to decide 
what would be the appropriate thing to do. And all

04:54.469 --> 05:01.157
along, as I'd work with this subcommittee, I would 
say, well, we need to do this plan. Uh-uh, we don't

05:01.738 --> 05:02.879
want a plan. Doris, forget about a plan. We don't 
want a plan. Well, then I got smarter. We all learn

05:07.741 --> 05:08.962
over the years. And I said, what we need is an action 
guide. We need an action guide for solid waste so

05:13.167 --> 05:25.480
that I'd say, now, do you think we ought to survey 
all the communities and do some research and

05:13.167 --> 05:25.480
figure out what the problems are in the different 
parts of the region? Definitely. I said, and you do

05:27.543 --> 05:33.930
want to know what technologies are available and 
what the advantages and disadvantages of each

05:27.543 --> 05:33.930
are. Definitely want that. And then you kind of 
want us to do some forecasts, analyze what the

05:36.282 --> 05:45.192
problems are now versus what they're likely to be 
and when. Oh, definitely. And I think you want us to

05:47.474 --> 05:52.119
make some recommendations as to actions that need 
to be taken. I said, yeah, they want to. I said,

05:53.941 --> 05:56.885
well, that sounds like an action guide to me. And so 
the board then. Pretty sneaky. Well, you know,

06:00.509 --> 06:01.750
hey. You got to do what you got to do. If you have one 
bad word, it may not be the concept that's bad. It

06:06.681 --> 06:07.503
may be the word. And that's what it turned out to be. 
They liked everything about it, but they didn't

06:09.245 --> 06:14.672
want to call it a plan. Then we went to individual 
governments. We wrote all of the governments a

06:17.176 --> 06:24.045
letter asking if they would be willing to put up a 
donation, voluntary contribution towards this

06:17.176 --> 06:24.045
plan. We gathered, I think, 35 or 40,000 dollars.

06:33.573 --> 06:40.765
And the council of governments added another, it 
wound up being about another $100,000 in order to

06:33.573 --> 06:40.765
develop this plan. Because it was something that 
the governments, they perceived that they needed

06:42.568 --> 06:48.017
this. Sure. Those that had the garbage had nowhere 
to put it. Those that didn't have it were receiving

06:50.502 --> 06:52.966
it. They didn't know what the future would hold. 
And it's the first time I would probably say that I

06:57.350 --> 07:06.323
was involved in a planning process where there was 
consistent interest on the part of elected

06:57.350 --> 07:06.323
officials. Several times when I gave 
presentations on the status of the planning

07:07.284 --> 07:24.007
program, and you couldn't avoid giving technical 
presentations showing them how we developed

07:07.284 --> 07:24.007
these little computer programs that would 
project landfill needs by acre and so forth. Never

07:24.027 --> 07:26.631
have I seen elected officials be interested in a 
technical. I was able to maintain their interest

07:31.602 --> 07:37.349
with presentations of technical material I 
wouldn't even present to them. But there was a

07:38.090 --> 07:41.615
sense that they should be part of this all the way 
through. When we finished, we took some brave

07:43.096 --> 07:45.379
stands. We said urban areas should not have 
landfills. The board went on record as saying that

07:50.306 --> 07:56.854
they favored waste to energy as the best way of 
taking care of solid waste. During the course of

08:00.559 --> 08:10.934
the study, the state legislature passed then 
House Bill 1719, which called for local and

08:00.559 --> 08:10.934
regional planning in solid waste management. The 
legislature then never funded the legislation,

08:10.954 --> 08:25.034
but it allowed, it put a little teeth into a plan 
because it allowed it to go through an approval

08:10.954 --> 08:25.034
process, which once approved, local actions 
would have to conform to it. Oh, yeah. The State

08:26.095 --> 08:30.280
Department of Health, of course, couldn't get 
around to writing regulations. And as long as we

08:30.340 --> 08:37.869
were doing this plan and getting a lot of support 
locally, we decided, well, it ought to be approved

08:30.340 --> 08:37.869
at the state. So we got together a committee from 
several COGs and wrote the regulations for them.

08:43.836 --> 08:51.124
And to date, have the only approved regional solid 
waste management plan in the state of Texas. It was

08:51.425 --> 08:54.489
a true plan in the sense of planning. We projected, 
we made service areas, we made recommendations

08:54.569 --> 09:00.677
for each area. It was extremely well received. And 
I believe that's because this was a local problem,

09:04.341 --> 09:15.295
identified locally, involved elected officials 
and the public very early on in the process.

09:15.896 --> 09:17.237
Financially committed. Committed local money. 
And the plan as it emerged was a true plan, but it was

09:19.994 --> 09:28.727
also a plan that understood the local processes.

09:30.129 --> 09:32.873
So, as I said, I've seen a total evolution. Shortly 
after the initial completion of the plan, when we

09:33.735 --> 09:45.192
were just looking into some implementation 
actions that the college should take, our

09:33.735 --> 09:45.192
recommendations were three levels. to the state, 
a level of regional recommendations with the

09:45.408 --> 09:56.905
largely additional studies that needed to be 
performed, and recommendations to the various

09:45.408 --> 09:56.905
units of government. And in a regional sense, our 
service areas were interjurisdictional. We

10:02.673 --> 10:08.982
totally ignored jurisdictional lines because 
the concept was that cities and counties have to

10:02.673 --> 10:08.982
work together in this area. And we made 
recommendations to each area. as we were

10:13.522 --> 10:30.262
beginning to proceed with implementing the 
regional portion of this, and I might add that

10:13.522 --> 10:30.262
there have been quite a number of local actions on 
the part of Houston as well as some of the

10:13.522 --> 10:30.262
surrounding areas since the adoption of the plan 
towards implementing it. At any rate... Who

10:31.123 --> 10:33.846
adopted the plan? The HSE Board of Directors, and 
then they sent it through all the mechanisms, and

10:33.866 --> 10:41.095
it was approved by the state of Texas and the 
Department of Health. Did the local units of

10:41.115 --> 10:42.617
government... We didn't ask them to individually 
adopt the plan. And some of it was because the

10:48.180 --> 11:00.511
nature of the state legislation, you couldn't use 
one of our service areas for a local planning

10:48.180 --> 11:00.511
effort, because the local planning effort had to 
be only a jurisdiction. You know what sometimes

11:01.632 --> 11:05.896
happens where a law is so specific as to defeat its 
own purpose. At any rate, shortly after its

11:05.956 --> 11:12.722
completion, and in fact, week that HGAC was 
honored locally for winning a planning award from

11:13.124 --> 11:36.702
Texas APA for the plan, the announcement was made 
that the comptroller at HGAC had embezzled just

11:13.124 --> 11:36.702
about all of the agency's money, which started a 
new phase for the Regional Council and that was Oh,

11:37.002 --> 11:41.087
I guess a little less than a year and a half ago. What 
was the month and date on that? It was December 1985

11:43.130 --> 11:45.893
that it was discovered. And what was discovered 
was that it had gone back over a period of seven

11:45.953 --> 11:50.099
years. And it was probably the final number, which 
will never be known, was probably close to $2

11:51.240 --> 11:58.850
million. We did better than that a day back. We had a 
$3.5 million loss. Did you have FBI agents in your

12:04.559 --> 12:08.025
office the next morning? We had them around the 
agency. No one ever came to my office, so I never

12:09.708 --> 12:12.753
even knew what they looked like. As it turned out, 
it was not federal funds that were involved,

12:12.973 --> 12:21.387
except for a very, very small amount. But the money 
was all pulled out using the administrative

12:21.428 --> 12:30.583
charges or indirect.

12:30.952 --> 12:38.846
all wound up being local money, which was just 
about all the money the COG had that they could

12:30.952 --> 12:38.846
spend in any discretionary way. As a result of 
that, any programs using local funding were

12:40.489 --> 12:48.543
automatically cut out of the budget. The COG had to 
borrow $800,000 just to survive. And so any local

12:54.847 --> 13:01.895
money that was coming in from dues and from the 
state was then used towards retiring the debt. And

13:01.915 --> 13:06.360
that effectively... Well, most of your programs 
did require local matching funds. Well, there was

13:06.600 --> 13:08.823
enough money set aside for matches. But the 
department that I had kind of created, which was

13:09.744 --> 13:18.094
really a true planning department, had very 
little outside funding. We received a water

13:18.574 --> 13:22.879
quality planning grant from the state very small 
community development grant, $25,000 to

13:23.483 --> 13:27.689
$30,000. And I guess as much as $300,000 a year, 
maybe a little more, was local money that was being

13:28.890 --> 13:38.623
used to support innovative programs. We 
developed a regional information service with a

13:39.604 --> 13:49.477
very nice demographics program, which not only 
served the local governments, but served the

13:39.604 --> 13:49.477
private sector as well. We were doing just a broad 
range of programs that were being funded locally.

13:55.482 --> 13:58.607
Well, all that money was effectively gone.

14:01.270 --> 14:03.614
As you know... What happened to him? Well, he pled 
guilty to over a million dollars theft, and he is

14:03.634 --> 14:08.881
now in federal prison. Along with... What was his 
name? Bill Prince. One of his staff spent six

14:14.950 --> 14:18.615
months in federal prison. Another member of the 
administration was indicted and pled guilty and

14:23.677 --> 14:32.827
got probation, several others on whom it was 
thought that charges would be filed. Charges just

14:32.847 --> 14:34.508
weren't filed. I believe that the US Attorney's 
Office gave immunity in return for information.

14:44.399 --> 14:45.620
But that was not. It took, as you can imagine, the 
better part of a year till the legal aspects of that

14:45.700 --> 14:51.105
were put away. And then the COG got very involved 
preparing lawsuits against the bank that cashed

14:54.085 --> 14:59.770
hundreds of thousand dollars in forged checks. 
And the auditor, who was the auditor for the prior

14:59.790 --> 15:12.821
four years, and told the board of directors at 
their last report how proud they should be of how

14:59.790 --> 15:12.821
well managed the money was. So that took a lot of 
attention. Who was the auditing firm? Ernst &

15:17.325 --> 15:19.327
Winning, one of the big eight firms. At any rate, 
waited for some of that to die down. And of course,

15:26.818 --> 15:34.827
any of the staff could not very well leave the 
agency until all investigation was complete. But

15:34.887 --> 15:38.631
it became obvious that we had come full circle. And 
the programs for the next, I would say, at least

15:38.812 --> 15:46.360
five years will be the very basic programs that 
have outside funding. And there wouldn't be an

15:46.660 --> 15:52.847
opportunity in the near term for the kinds of 
innovative or true planning work that we were

15:53.063 --> 15:55.045
doing. So as you know three months ago I tendered my 
resignation and am now operating as an

15:56.046 --> 16:04.115
independent consultant.

16:06.397 --> 16:22.615
I'm sure that affected the careers of quite a few 
people in terms of shifts or new opportunities and

16:06.397 --> 16:22.615
possibly a shift in terms of as you've already 
suggested, the centers of activity of the

16:23.337 --> 16:29.584
professional staff. I think, too, although my 
department was most profoundly affected

16:30.885 --> 16:46.802
financially, and we immediately, within the 
course of the year, lost three positions, and a

16:30.885 --> 16:46.802
fourth one was jeopardized, and that was at the 
staff of eight or nine. But it affected others in

16:47.883 --> 16:52.568
that the transportation manager, who was a and has 
a national reputation, had only been there two

16:53.054 --> 16:59.365
years, left over a controversial issue in a plan. 
The COG was in a position, in my opinion, where it

16:59.385 --> 17:07.239
couldn't handle any more controversy. Couldn't 
handle headlines. There had been a real loss of

17:08.721 --> 17:10.985
credibility. And whereas before the scandal, 
they would have taken on the issue and stood up for

17:12.187 --> 17:18.538
what you know, they felt was the proper planning 
perspective. I think at the time, they just

17:22.813 --> 17:25.716
couldn't do that. I can understand that, because 
the executive committee of our general assembly

17:27.538 --> 17:46.939
decided that after the theft of the $3.5 million by 
our Tom Cruax, that they had to take things easy and

17:27.538 --> 17:46.939
were unwilling to become involved in any kind of 
innovative programs whatsoever, and sort of

17:47.628 --> 17:59.581
relaxed in the position of being kind of a 
information center for the region. Well, there

17:59.601 --> 18:04.186
seems to me to be a concern about taking on anything 
controversial. And there isn't even money to be an

18:05.027 --> 18:09.693
information center, because that was being 
locally funded. So I don't know what there's going

18:15.860 --> 18:20.287
to be now the best funded program at the COG is the 
Jobs Training Partnership Act. And though it's

18:21.849 --> 18:28.920
being administered by a COG, it isn't a planning 
program in any sense of the word. So I see the agency

18:29.381 --> 18:37.473
moving a lot more towards direct service, 
provision of service type programs, and away from

18:29.381 --> 18:37.473
planning. Interestingly, when they advertised 
the job, one of the qualifications as far as

18:37.613 --> 18:43.943
education was, a degree in planning or a number of 
things, or a degree in business. So it's a totally

18:49.933 --> 18:55.264
different perspective now, I believe. Then it 
makes one wonder about the future of regional

18:55.284 --> 18:59.552
planning in Texas. Yes, that's true because there 
are 24 councils of government in Texas. The state

19:05.575 --> 19:07.998
is quite supportive of them. I mean, it's 
legislated. The boundaries are legislated. The

19:11.021 --> 19:14.565
state provides a planning grant each year. But 
there are problems in many of them. They're either

19:18.249 --> 19:24.015
not well enough funded or politically they're not 
well enough accepted. Or they lack professional

19:24.655 --> 19:27.278
leadership. There are not a whole lot of 
professional planners in the regional planning

19:27.511 --> 19:34.259
agencies. Now when I left, I had been for several 
years the only member of AICP that was on the staff.

19:43.910 --> 19:47.974
Shortly before I left, I did hire another 
certified planner. Who was that? Jeff Table. And

19:50.798 --> 19:55.543
he's now, as far as I know, the only member of AICP on 
the staff. One of my former students. That's

19:57.978 --> 20:03.250
right, and a very fine young

19:57.978 --> 20:03.250
player. Is he AICP now? Good for him. Well, North 
Central Texas Cog has a good reputation. Yes, and

20:11.065 --> 20:13.929
they do some good work, and they're well-funded. I 
think one of the differences is my perception is

20:14.029 --> 20:19.917
that they are not quite as political. They work a 
lot more with, say, the city managers where we

20:20.378 --> 20:25.665
worked with the mayors. And I think that makes a 
difference, so that they're able to stay more in

20:26.326 --> 20:35.158
the technical arena, where we were more in the 
political arena. However, we probably make

20:35.178 --> 20:39.925
bigger strides in forming public policy. They 
have a very well-organized

20:41.896 --> 20:49.825
police training. Yes, HGAC does that as well. Do 
they? But to me, that's, again, a kind of a service

20:53.610 --> 20:58.115
function rather than a planning function. And it 
worries me when we talk about the shift of

20:58.135 --> 21:09.709
activities of councils of government away from 
planning. to providing service activities,

21:10.128 --> 21:17.981
which tend, in my mind, to become nothing more than 
busy work. Well, it's different. It's

21:18.822 --> 21:19.944
administration. And that's not what planning is. 
Unfortunately, in this country, in the late

21:22.789 --> 21:31.022
1980s, planning is still, as a profession, not 
proven itself in some way. And when there isn't

21:33.595 --> 21:39.823
federal support for planning, which there hasn't 
been for quite some years now. Since Nixon.

21:41.004 --> 21:41.585
Exactly. You're unlikely to see the kinds of good 
planning that we used to see. It still tends to be a

21:47.171 --> 21:53.498
way of justifying for a government to do what 
they're going to do anyway. It tends to take place

21:54.660 --> 21:57.583
not by planners, I've been, since I've been in 
private practice, interested that every

21:57.867 --> 22:04.694
engineer calls themselves a planner. Every 
economist calls themselves a planner. I don't

22:07.937 --> 22:10.260
call myself an economist or an engineer. Well, if 
planning is so unpopular politically, I think

22:10.820 --> 22:19.189
it's all the more remarkable that they

22:10.820 --> 22:19.189
do so. That engineers and architects always seem 
to call themselves planners. Because everyone

22:22.673 --> 22:41.454
acknowledges there's a component that has to be 
the plan, but that's because you need that

22:22.673 --> 22:41.454
component to justify spending a lot of money on 
capital improvements, rather than before you

22:22.673 --> 22:41.454
think of spending the money, you know that you have 
to think this through and what it's going to mean to

22:22.673 --> 22:41.454
the future and what's needed and where it's 
needed. There's a tendency for everyone to think

22:43.136 --> 22:46.579
that they can do that. It makes me wonder, too, 
if... The members of APA, as we now know it, are

22:52.441 --> 23:14.179
going to continue to push for registration of the 
title and practice of planning as being a

22:52.441 --> 23:14.179
professional activity rather than considering 
planning in its generic form. I haven't heard a

23:16.133 --> 23:20.941
whole lot about that in recent years, but I would 
like certainly to see it. All anyone seems to need

23:21.843 --> 23:25.709
to do to be a planner is to go to a few meetings.

23:27.933 --> 23:41.095
Interestingly, you know, I was in China last fall 
as part of a delegation of urban planners, and the

23:27.933 --> 23:41.095
thing that struck me the most about the difference 
in planning was we presented oh, the

23:41.530 --> 23:49.339
environmental review process, and how you go 
about historic preservation from a process

23:41.530 --> 23:49.339
perspective, an economic development process. 
And they presented projects to us. And I think

23:53.043 --> 23:55.005
we're always fighting. We feel that we've evolved 
into a process, which is what true planning is. And

24:00.691 --> 24:02.614
yet, that seems to still be the battle. Is planning 
something you do to allow a project to continue? Or

24:06.918 --> 24:10.963
is it an ongoing process that helps you to deal with 
all the issues of an urban society.

24:15.649 --> 24:18.393
How do you feel we've evolved in which one of those 
ways? Well, I think that we view it, planners see

24:18.473 --> 24:30.231
the process and seem to understand this as an 
ongoing process and it doesn't shock them that you

24:18.473 --> 24:30.231
have to update your forecast annually. A lot of the 
politicians and a lot of public service people in

24:30.973 --> 24:37.643
other areas still see it as the project. develop a 
new water source, you're going to have to have

24:37.927 --> 24:43.392
something you call the plan that says, do it. Yeah, 
you're saying that planters really have learned

24:44.493 --> 24:49.578
how to deal with change. I think they have, but I 
don't think they've instructed the others or the

24:50.318 --> 24:55.683
public. Well, of course, this used to be the role of 
ASPO before we amalgamated with them and to try to

24:57.005 --> 25:07.174
educate the lay planters. And this is one of the 
reasons that I felt it was important in 1970 to have

25:07.897 --> 25:22.198
a short course for planning commissioners, which 
then, a few years later, I felt we should expand to

25:07.897 --> 25:22.198
public officials. And that, I think, has done some 
good in Texas. It has. And I think what you just said

25:28.387 --> 25:30.550
is what's significant. Planning officials 
sometimes understand, but it's the other public

25:30.951 --> 25:34.957
officials. Your public works director doesn't 
understand. No. And the elected officials? No,

25:39.822 --> 25:40.402
they don't. It's not politically comfortable, 
because one of the reasons solid waste is such an

25:40.863 --> 25:50.852
issue is that it's an issue that requires 
long-range planning. It takes many years to

25:51.493 --> 25:55.677
implement a proper solid waste project. It isn't 
politically feasible for anyone that's elected

25:56.077 --> 26:01.562
to office to bring up the subject. And no one, well, 
I won't say no one, very few are willing to put their

26:07.820 --> 26:14.247
careers on the line for a project that isn't going 
to be up and running for 10 or 20 years. And so they

26:15.228 --> 26:17.250
avoid the issue. And yes, they avoid the issue. And 
frequently, there were hearings on the community

26:19.532 --> 26:26.219
development program for small cities. One of the 
commissioners who has since resigned, but didn't

26:27.120 --> 26:32.325
run again from Harris County, testified. And he 
said, Harris County is not eligible for this

26:33.991 --> 26:36.335
program. We're an entitlement community. But I 
want to encourage having this program and doing,

26:39.760 --> 26:56.845
you know, giving the money out on a regional basis 
because, he says, I have to recognize as a

26:39.760 --> 26:56.845
commissioner in Harris County that it's because 
of Houston and Harris County that many of these

26:39.760 --> 26:56.845
small communities are having the problems 
they're having. our enormous growth has spread

26:57.162 --> 27:06.074
these problems, and it's incumbent on us to at 
least support any way that they can have relief

26:57.162 --> 27:06.074
from these problems. And that was a very 
forward-thinking view, but he was, not by

27:07.256 --> 27:18.672
profession, he's a political scientist, but he 
understood what you try to do with planning. Sure,

27:18.692 --> 27:22.057
sure. Well, Doris, thanks very much for your 
inputs, and you'll be getting a transcription to

27:27.098 --> 27:33.037
review and comment on so you'll have your chance 
then to add anything or make any corrections that

27:27.098 --> 27:33.037
are needed. Well, I enjoyed it. I hope it didn't end 
my career. Thank you.
