WEBVTT

00:03.338 --> 00:06.381
over by the campus theater. And I really don't know 
how I got my business messed up, but I did terribly.

00:12.968 --> 00:16.191
First of all, my grades were terrible. And 
secondly, I got to bumming around with some

00:16.792 --> 00:23.959
upperclassmen in other units. And I'm going to say 
that they led me wrong on whatever And I turned up

00:31.688 --> 00:41.077
having a

00:31.688 --> 00:41.077
clash of personalities with my first sergeant. 
And it got rather serious.

00:47.423 --> 00:50.025
They had what they called rams at that time. A 
little book about the book of rams looked like a set

00:50.986 --> 00:57.192
of three to five note cards. And another class 
would write you some rams. thought you deserved

01:01.912 --> 01:03.373
such. My first son thought I deserved a bunch of 
them. I think I set an indoor record for RAM. It led

01:13.443 --> 01:18.408
to my acquiring the name of Head. You want to hear 
that story? Yes, yes. I can't believe this is

01:22.632 --> 01:28.477
thrilling, but I had a grandfella in my outfit 
named Buckwires. What a great guy he was. And he was

01:31.527 --> 01:34.150
a San Antonio boy. Went to Central Catholic over 
and came to A&M. He was a senior when I was a

01:38.496 --> 01:41.700
freshman, which made him class of 42. But for 
whatever reason it was, he laid over and became a

01:42.381 --> 01:46.827
five-year man. And bear in mind that a senior was 
somebody that you spoke to with care, you held in

01:47.347 --> 02:01.045
great reverence, and the only thing above a senior 
was a five-year man. Weiss was still taking

02:05.014 --> 02:10.561
military science and that type of thing. But I ran 
into all this trouble with his first son, who

02:10.581 --> 02:19.473
incidentally was a good guy, but what a class of 
personality. Anyway, Buck said to his first son,

02:19.493 --> 02:26.442
anything, to paraphrase, I'll have a talk with 
Davis and I'll straighten him out. From now on, you

02:31.888 --> 02:34.671
leave him alone, I'll take him over. So he got me in a 
room on the third floor, I'm going to say room 14.

02:44.503 --> 02:46.185
And he, nobody there but us. He told me, he said, now 
the first sergeant has turned you over to me.

02:50.010 --> 02:53.154
You're my responsibility from now on. And I think 
that you'll be gone from here before long because I

02:53.174 --> 02:57.880
think We're all going to run you off. He said, 
someday, if you do stay around, since you may be a

03:02.392 --> 03:20.234
junior or a senior or even a five-year man like me, 
he said, someday, you might have a gold hat card and

03:02.392 --> 03:20.234
you might get to wear boots. But he said, you've got 
to bear in mind that if I tell you that wall's pink,

03:20.254 --> 03:26.181
it's pink. Remember this. like it was yesterday. 
And he said, whatever else I tell you, that's the

03:30.054 --> 03:34.461
gospel. And he said, it doesn't make any 
difference if you do become a singer. He said to me,

03:38.167 --> 03:42.975
you ain't never going to be anything but a 
pisshead. And that was only what number of years

03:42.995 --> 03:45.779
ago? Summer of 1942. And somebody heard that, I 
guess, or he repeated it to them, and they

03:48.364 --> 03:53.652
mercifully deleted the prefix and I became known 
as Head and it's endured quite well. Buck Wires, a

04:01.108 --> 04:04.933
great guy.

04:06.415 --> 04:16.108
Memorable teachers, advisors, other 
non-student individuals that had an important

04:06.415 --> 04:16.108
effect on your life?

04:19.532 --> 04:21.715
Who were some of the outstanding

04:24.884 --> 04:28.910
Oh, mercy.

04:28.930 --> 04:36.241
I was in such terrible trouble up until World War II 
as a student at Texas A&M. I had, of course, the

04:37.823 --> 04:44.052
usual number of professors and they were all smart 
and they were all good. I just didn't listen

04:44.373 --> 04:47.016
carefully. As a matter of fact, I would have never 
graduated from Texas A&M, I'm quite sure, had not

04:47.036 --> 04:54.267
World War II occurred. The government mobilized 
16 million people so I could get out of A&M. Because

05:00.614 --> 05:06.379
before the war, I was in every school they had. But 
every time I turned around, I was meeting up with

05:06.399 --> 05:10.483
chemistry. And I was just out of it. Just 
absolutely out of it. After the war, it was a

05:16.689 --> 05:19.712
different story. Who was your chemistry teacher? 
Oh, Dr. Potter. Dr. Potter. I'm sorry, Dr. Potts.

05:28.333 --> 05:29.174
He had a son. As a matter of fact, the psychiatrist, 
Devin Bryan, I'm not sure that he's still here, but

05:29.654 --> 05:36.080
Dr. Potts. Did he have a nickname? I can't recall 
that he did. The other famous chemistry professor

05:40.445 --> 05:44.429
over there was Heddy N. Jones. He did have it. Later 
became a client of mine and his family. Now what was

05:49.073 --> 05:50.094
his nickname? Hed N. Jones. Do you know why that? 
Why that head end came? I do not know. He would come

05:58.756 --> 06:10.392
into class and he would say, in

05:58.756 --> 06:10.392
regard to the next meeting of this class, it 
depends on how Mrs. Jones treats me. If she bakes me

06:11.393 --> 06:15.919
a cherry pie, you probably won't have a quiz. But if 
she doesn't make me a cherry pie, you're probably

06:15.939 --> 06:20.265
going to have a quiz. I knew him well and in later 
years. What about English? Oh, there was some of

06:26.229 --> 06:34.678
the famous names. Talk about those. There was 
Shaky Powell. Seemed like to me he taught me some

06:44.107 --> 06:51.615
type of public speaking and he had a remarkable 
voice. He made fun or ridiculed Aggies to an extent

06:52.557 --> 06:56.581
respectfully. He said, you think you can yell loud 
for A&M athletes greatness on Kyle feet? He said,

07:04.710 --> 07:05.791
listen to this. And he had something about his 
voice that he could make the walls crumble. I

07:11.376 --> 07:13.238
remember that very well, very vividly. And as I 
recall, that was shaky power. And so he could make

07:16.962 --> 07:18.384
the walls shake. With that voice. You have to do it. 
And that's exactly what we need. To modulate his

07:22.715 --> 07:25.419
voice. I remember well, he said, now listen to 
this. You learn to do that, and you make some noise

07:27.481 --> 07:30.765
and kind of think. There was Square Root Jackson. 
He taught mathematics. Didn't teach me much, but

07:37.072 --> 07:40.136
he was a mathematics guy. And probably a single 
man. I know as late as 1963 when I moved back to

07:44.501 --> 07:49.547
Bryan, he was still riding them. bicycle down 
Texas Avenue and you didn't want to do that even in

07:50.371 --> 07:54.355
1963. He used to come in a classroom and approach 
the blackboard with an eraser and he would take a

07:54.435 --> 08:07.148
couple of minutes and would erase that board 
symmetrically. Very precise. It was a beautiful

08:08.369 --> 08:10.412
thing when he finished. Then he would take that 
eraser and he would dust it across the back of a

08:11.012 --> 08:14.836
chair. And then he would hold it at eye level and 
drop it two or three times on the floor, pick it up

08:18.856 --> 08:22.640
and drop it again. I had an old classmate, Bobby 
Harris, down in Abasota. He one day said, hey,

08:26.364 --> 08:30.408
Ruth, how come you dropped the racer like that? And 
he said, Mr. Harris, someday I'm going to turn it

08:30.428 --> 08:35.173
loose and it won't fall. And Mr. Harris didn't have 
any future in trigonometry after that. Great old

08:39.177 --> 08:41.360
gentleman. There was a fellow named Dutch Halpern 
who was a brilliant mathematician. I don't know

08:46.565 --> 08:52.734
whether he's been mentioned to you or not, but he 
was top of the line in the mathematics department

08:46.565 --> 08:52.734
at the time. And, of course, you heard him 
screaming Allen Elson. Describe him. Oh, he

08:57.641 --> 08:59.784
was... I can remember him saying, I have spent nine 
years in the college classroom preparing to

08:59.804 --> 09:06.794
teach. And when he taught, you could hear him all 
over the campus. That's the name... I knew him well

09:13.801 --> 09:18.428
in later years after moving back to Bryan. What did 
he scream about?

09:23.415 --> 09:31.607
Of course he was teaching history because I 
remember South American history I think perhaps

09:23.415 --> 09:31.607
was his specialty. But did he have some special 
likes or dislikes? That I can't recall. I probably

09:38.297 --> 09:39.839
wasn't listening good enough. Who else? Oh, 
Mercy. Dr. Cofer was a well-known fellow around on

09:45.526 --> 09:49.370
the campus. His son, D. Brooks Cofer, Jr., still in 
Bryan, fine lawyer. Dr. Cofer was an English

09:54.537 --> 09:58.201
fellow. Seemed like to me he was called Dusty, but 
I'm not sure. I never had him. But he gave me some

10:03.467 --> 10:12.057
very interesting pamphlets fit for the archive of 
Texas A&M. I knew him, and he was a grand old

10:13.252 --> 10:18.199
general. In later years, a fellow that didn't 
impress me or help me along in courses after the war

10:19.020 --> 10:28.913
was a fellow named Satch Elkins. I'm thinking of 
those that have got these nicknames. Why Satch? I

10:35.742 --> 10:36.623
can't recall. I don't know that one either. I don't 
know, but he was a business professor. But he was,

10:40.235 --> 10:41.677
E.W. was his initial rider called, but he was 
notoriously known in sacks everywhere. Another

10:46.944 --> 10:52.011
industry one was Homer Hill Norton, who was a 
football coach. Well respected, a member of the

10:52.031 --> 10:57.058
college football hall of fame. He was called by his 
ball player, Hoghead, for H.A. Wasn't that

11:02.385 --> 11:03.326
creative? I can't remember that there are others. 
There are bound to be. Okay. One of them, I do

11:09.930 --> 11:14.997
remember a statistician named Miles Hamilton. 
You know, this was the era of nicknames. Now, were

11:18.262 --> 11:24.491
those nicknames put-downs, or were they, in fact, 
backhanded compliments? Backhanded

11:24.991 --> 11:28.997
compliments in every instance, I would say. I 
think so, too. A lot of my classmates, a lot of my

11:30.039 --> 11:37.309
acquaintances, some older, had nicknames. We had 
a fellow that we called Wampajaw first.

11:42.785 --> 11:44.027
Notoriously known. That Buck Weirson one. Got an 
old friend here in College Station now. His

11:48.134 --> 11:50.697
initials were FC, so he was called Flatcock. And 
known quite well. Catfish Winters. Shorty

11:56.346 --> 11:57.167
Fuller. Dog Dawson. Jelly Stein. Not everybody, 
but many had nicknames. I don't know that children

12:04.779 --> 12:06.722
knew that anymore. All right, now on a serious 
note, if you turned to someone for advice and

12:07.462 --> 12:16.795
counsel, particularly when you came back after 
the war, who was it?

12:23.966 --> 12:25.247
After the war? Either one, but I was meaning don't 
leave that era out. If I had a problem prior to, and I

12:29.373 --> 12:34.701
lived with problems, My battery commander before 
the war, as I said, was Jack Taylor and Tudor Ball.

12:42.786 --> 12:48.010
They were very, very nice guys and great 
gentlemen, great soldiers. And you could go, a

12:48.030 --> 12:54.015
freshman could go to them with a problem. You could 
not go to the sophomore class with a problem.

12:59.720 --> 13:02.262
You did not want to see those people. That's 
just...

13:05.832 --> 13:35.772
just the way it was but it had a good some good points 
not many but some good one of them was you were

13:05.832 --> 13:35.772
obligated to know everybody in your dormitory and 
and almost literally their hometown and their

13:05.832 --> 13:35.772
course of study which meant

13:05.832 --> 13:35.772
not very many places could i be in texas that i don't 
know somebody unless they did i did know somebody

13:36.173 --> 13:39.797
And that was part of the deal.

13:43.301 --> 13:50.949
After the war,

13:43.301 --> 13:50.949
Lord, I was an old man by then, as everybody else 
was. I was 22 years old, something like that. And I

13:55.635 --> 13:57.156
was dead serious then. I made up my mind to be a 
lawyer. Dead serious. And whereas I made all C's

14:01.638 --> 14:07.724
and D's and F's before the war, I made all A's after 
the war. That's the only way I got into law school,

14:07.744 --> 14:11.528
with a C after. All right, now we won't get to that 
war, those things in a minute. What were the

14:15.452 --> 14:25.882
expected rules

14:15.452 --> 14:25.882
of classroom behavior and attendance and so forth 
for you before you go away to the war? Well, you

14:27.423 --> 14:30.126
weren't going to miss any classes. The 
upperclassmen saw that. We did not miss classes.

14:35.167 --> 14:45.901
And I don't ever recall any disturbance in the 
classroom of any kind or any place else.

14:45.921 --> 14:48.724
Sophomores handled all that. Whereas you got Bob 
White and 150 policemen now, you had a sophomore

14:48.744 --> 14:54.872
class that could handle that discipline. That 
presented no problem. No problem. Did you go to

14:59.438 --> 15:00.619
sleep in class? Oh, yeah. Yeah, I did some of them. 
Got a hot foot one time. I got literally the only hot

15:05.651 --> 15:09.315
foot I've ever had. I got a hot foot at the Rural 
Socialist Clinic. Dr. Dan Davis was teaching it,

15:12.659 --> 15:18.746
and I am almost sure that he never missed a beat. He 
was giving his lecture and didn't intend to be

15:19.907 --> 15:25.314
interrupted by a hot foot, and it almost killed 
him. And I did scream out, never missed a beat.

15:29.719 --> 15:30.640
Summer of 42. Let's see, YMCA, did it have a, what 
happened at that building? What role did that

15:37.813 --> 15:44.039
building play in a student's life? Well, there 
were two. One was called the old Y building that

15:46.502 --> 15:49.706
still stands. It's right out the west door of the 
academic building, right across the street from

15:50.967 --> 15:59.096
the old Y's law and puryear halls. I guess they're 
now gone. The Cavalry Regiment had a rich heritage

16:01.045 --> 16:06.090
in those two buildings, I'll tell you. But the old Y 
was operated by a fellow named Cashin, Red

16:07.371 --> 16:14.298
Cashin's father. I can't recall his initials. 
Probably M.L. Red's Mason Lee, and he's probably

16:20.324 --> 16:23.707
Mason Lee Jr. I knew Mr. Cashin casually, knew who 
he was. Seemed like to be in the bottom of the old Y.

16:31.252 --> 16:33.915
there was a small bowling alley. Can't be sure 
about that. I am positive that in the bottom of the

16:35.296 --> 16:45.548
old wine was a small confectionery that was 
operated by Bill Sparks and J.F. Casey. Again,

16:47.590 --> 16:50.013
Bill Sparks and J.F. Casey sat on a high stool and 
took in nickels and dimes and a fortune. You get a

16:54.718 --> 16:57.821
sandwich there if you had the money and get an ice 
cream cone. And there were a couple reading rooms

16:58.722 --> 17:01.005
upstairs It seemed like. I'm sure the Y must have 
conducted some probably very good and native

17:03.435 --> 17:09.062
programs. I was never in on any of them because I was 
busy over in the new area. Then there was a new Y. The

17:17.654 --> 17:30.992
new Y was, I believe, a stucco building right at the 
extreme northwest corner of the block occupied by

17:17.654 --> 17:30.992
the 12 dormitories called the new area. And they 
had a pool table in there and not much else. They did

17:36.481 --> 17:48.939
have a radio because I heard President 
Roosevelt's speech to the Congress in that

17:36.481 --> 17:48.939
building on that radio. Hold that one because 
that's important. Guyon Hall. Oh, Guyon Hall.

17:54.087 --> 17:55.168
What happened in Guyon Hall? They showed you a 
picture. It might have charged a quarter there.

17:59.508 --> 18:01.831
What other events happened in Gine Hall? Oh, they 
bring different things there. Freshmen would get

18:03.754 --> 18:07.720
to see some of them. Now, could you go to a movie any 
night you wanted to? I remember attending

18:09.923 --> 18:18.635
a religious activity in Gine Hall. What kind? Some 
speaker who was here for, let's say, two or three

18:19.977 --> 18:25.364
days. Religious emphasis week, maybe? Perhaps, 
perhaps. Guy Hall was famous for another thing.

18:31.999 --> 18:32.340
What's that? Well, he had a basement. Not really a 
basement. He had an underneath area. And when the

18:39.786 --> 18:45.991
upperclassmen left here in the spring, you could 
store a footlocker under there. And you had to get

18:47.392 --> 18:53.217
out on your stomach to crawl around almost to find 
these footlockers. And one of the chores of a new

18:53.237 --> 18:58.742
freshman was to get under the building and find his 
warden master's Foot Locker. And you met a lot of

19:01.489 --> 19:06.556
good fellows under there with the same chore you 
did. Do you remember any important

19:06.576 --> 19:12.885
personalities, nationally famous people that 
came to visit the campus? To visit the campus?

19:22.538 --> 19:23.920
Like Roosevelt didn't come? He came here before I 
was around, probably in 1939 maybe. But Garner

19:29.737 --> 19:33.442
didn't come and John J. Pershing didn't come. I 
remember after the war now, there was an

19:33.462 --> 19:42.534
outstanding man, General Eisenhower, spoke at 
the muster in 1946 in Kyle Field. Describe that.

19:44.576 --> 19:44.997
Well...

19:56.907 --> 19:58.889
I get goofy every now and then. No, no. That's what 
we want.

20:03.274 --> 20:04.416
Well, it was a great time. And the reason it was a 
great time is because it was April the 21st. Surely

20:11.804 --> 20:13.426
I'm correct about that. In 1946. And not

20:14.347 --> 20:23.377
everybody, but nearly everybody was back from 
World War II. And the campus was swarming with

20:26.843 --> 20:33.913
folks you had known before the war. Not all of them 
were in school on that very day, but they came

20:36.356 --> 20:45.108
everywhere to hear General Eisenhower. And it was 
well known, well publicized. It was a big time

20:49.273 --> 20:50.635
event. General Eisenhower, as I recall, had been 
very generous about praise

21:05.673 --> 21:07.615
Anyway, it was a big deal. Did he say anything 
special about Aggies? I can't recall, but he had to

21:09.758 --> 21:12.200
be complimentary. I can't recall. I was there. 
Before the war, do you remember going to Muster's?

21:21.651 --> 21:21.951
No.

21:24.734 --> 21:26.196
I've often thought about that.

21:29.179 --> 21:33.604
It may be

21:29.179 --> 21:33.604
that on an old dark as I remember wet day at the 
evening formation retreat in 1942 it seemed to me

21:34.192 --> 22:01.397
that a number of names were called out none of which 
I could hear they were doing this down around

21:34.192 --> 22:01.397
Duncan Hall and I've often thought that maybe that 
was a muster but I'm not sure that it was. The first

22:04.999 --> 22:11.347
musket I recall in my own experience was at Camp 
Ruber, Oklahoma in 1943. What camp? Camp Ruber.

22:14.210 --> 22:14.691
Ruber. In 1943. Let's see. Before the war, now, 
were still silver taps. Where and what was it?

22:25.264 --> 22:28.167
Yeah, I remember silver taps vividly. Do it the 
same way. You assembled in front of the academic

22:29.862 --> 22:37.950
building and they came out on the portico, is that 
what I wanted to say? Balcony up there. And... Who

22:41.414 --> 22:43.776
went? I assumed everybody. I certainly did. Lord, 
if I got to go, everybody went. And how did you

22:52.465 --> 22:56.889
behave afterward?

22:56.909 --> 22:58.671
After TAPS is over, I have no clear memory, but I 
can't imagine that you did anything except slink

22:59.039 --> 23:05.088
away to your hole. I think that's good.

23:09.876 --> 23:10.276
Let's see. Other student organizations other 
than the Corps before the war. Bands, singing

23:16.306 --> 23:18.008
cadets, anything? Describe those.

23:22.215 --> 23:25.620
Well, I would say to you that undoubtedly, student 
government as it is known now is

23:26.495 --> 23:37.470
terribly different than what the situation was 
then. The student life business was in the Corps of

23:38.031 --> 23:42.558
Cadets. Everybody, with few exceptions, were in 
the Corps of Cadets. If you were a bad 4F person or a

23:49.247 --> 23:54.915
slight handful of graduate students, you might 
not belong to the Corps. But other than that,

23:58.185 --> 24:08.494
everybody belonged to the Corps, and you had about 
all the student life you could have with what went

23:58.185 --> 24:08.494
on in your military unit. Now, I can remember that 
many towns. I can remember that Wichita Falls, my

24:12.798 --> 24:17.742
hometown, had a Wichita Falls hometown club. And 
what did those hometown clubs do? Oh, Lord, we did

24:21.246 --> 24:23.508
meet. I got to go a time or two. One thing we did, I can 
recall, this was a before-the-war event, was we

24:25.372 --> 24:37.244
brought the Aggieland Orchestra to Wichita Falls 
during the Christmas season. They made a big tour

24:37.264 --> 24:45.533
over many spots in Texas over that period, and one 
stop was in Wichita Falls, a big dance. What was the

24:45.733 --> 24:47.615
Aggieland Orchestra? Was this a symphony? Oh, 
yes, it was a symphony. There's a fellow named

24:52.960 --> 24:54.602
Curly Brown. headed that deal up. My friend Buck 
Wires played the drums and sang way on the

24:56.201 --> 25:03.549
outskirts of town. And an old classmate of mine who 
was a freshman, very unusual for a freshman to be in

25:05.190 --> 25:18.764
an Angolan orchestra, but he happened to be a good 
sax man and we called him Fish Angolan Murphy

25:05.190 --> 25:18.764
because he was a member of the band. A boy named 
Dinkle Webb played something Freddie Nelson, who

25:22.763 --> 25:30.294
still lives in Bryan today, played at my 50th 
wedding anniversary in February. Was the piano

25:30.694 --> 25:31.736
man? Oh, let me think. Don Hackney played a 
saxophone. This was a band. Something else I need

25:40.328 --> 25:44.234
to mention about them, too. This was a band who 
played popular tunes of the day. The significant

25:47.599 --> 25:50.543
thing about it is, I suppose, It was in the spring or 
summer of 1942 that they played on the Fitch

25:51.687 --> 26:00.198
Bandwagon. The Fitch Bandwagon was a

26:00.218 --> 26:13.696
network radio program whereby college bands came 
to perhaps New York. It certainly wasn't

26:14.317 --> 26:16.079
Waxahachie. It was Chicago, New York, or 
wherever. And that was their program for that day.

26:22.641 --> 26:26.545
It was a tremendous event on A&M campus. All of the 
windows were open. You didn't have a radio. You

26:29.147 --> 26:30.128
heard the radio. Who was the director of that? 
Curly Brown was our student. Oh, yeah. All of them

26:37.455 --> 26:39.156
were students. Oh, yeah. And they played for 
dances if they didn't have some big-time guy

26:40.417 --> 26:44.521
coming in. Now, do you remember any of the big-time 
groups that did come? Oh, yeah. Who? There

26:49.045 --> 26:56.853
was a fella named, I guess, Jimmy. Jimmy Lunsford. 
He was a big-time deal. Carmen Caballero.

27:09.104 --> 27:16.872
Got to be others because the regimental balls and 
the senior ring dance, that was big-time stuff.

27:16.892 --> 27:18.233
Now, where were those dances held? Sabisa Hall. 
Describe them. Describe the dances? Well, the

27:23.618 --> 27:27.563
girls came from everywhere. And the girls came out 
from Bryan. They were known as the Bryan 400. And

27:33.650 --> 27:42.321
the girls came from Denton, from, I don't know if 
that was still CIA or TSCW or what at the time. They

27:43.102 --> 27:47.847
came on buses and so on. Like her? How did the dance 
participants dress? Girls had on nice forms. And

27:58.485 --> 28:00.607
you could wear tuxedos. If you didn't have 
tuxedos, a tuxedo, you wore a

28:01.068 --> 28:09.378
dress uniform. Dresses that you hate, the best 
dress you hate. And what kind of behavior pattern

28:13.002 --> 28:16.326
was there at those? There was very little ruckus on 
the inside. It was quite tame. There was always

28:22.046 --> 28:25.710
some activity elsewhere. That was a big late 
Dayton time. You could find out, could I have a late

28:28.292 --> 28:32.455
Dayton? That meant after her main man took her 
home, you could pick her up and so on. And it'd be

28:36.459 --> 28:42.304
some visiting of the local joints, of which there 
wasn't too many, but so on. What were those local

28:42.324 --> 28:43.645
joints? Oh, I could talk a day about that. Is this 
going on longer than you want it to go? No, no, no.

28:53.348 --> 28:56.232
And if we don't finish today, we'll come back 
another day at your convenience. Do you

28:56.252 --> 28:59.035
understand that I slept on my head last night? 
You've got a stiff neck. I've got a stiff neck. I

29:03.720 --> 29:15.574
guess the most famous joint was Ed's, Uncle Ed's, 
which was on the Wellman Road within walking

29:03.720 --> 29:15.574
distance of the campus. famous old gentleman out 
there, his name was Hartlicker, Ed Hartlicker.

29:24.909 --> 29:35.646
And he had a daughter, Marilyn, who courted Jack 
Fugate, who was the winner of the Ugly Man contest

29:24.909 --> 29:35.646
at the time. They still do. Lord have mercy, I can't 
think of his wife. Anyway, Arnold Ed's. It was a

29:44.880 --> 29:46.202
famous place. You would take a girl there. There'd 
be no trouble. There was just a lot of beer drinking

29:51.035 --> 29:54.159
that went on, to be real. What were the favorite 
brands of beer that Aggies considered? Oh, I would

29:58.364 --> 30:03.671
suppose there were two

29:58.364 --> 30:03.671
that come to mind. There might have been others, 
but certainly Grand Prize was in the heyday at the

30:03.731 --> 30:13.202
time, and Southern Select, and Jack's,

30:14.009 --> 30:16.613
I don't remember Bud being particularly popular. 
It had to exist, but I don't recall it. Did you dance

30:20.919 --> 30:23.143
at Uncle Ed's? Little. Did you eat? A little, not 
much. It was a beer joint for kids. Was there any

30:30.353 --> 30:35.421
kind of rule that you remember about age in order to 
buy beer?

30:39.387 --> 30:42.852
Lord have mercy, it couldn't have been much 
because I came here at 16. And was there a problem

30:43.456 --> 30:46.480
with drunkenness? Some of those little A&M boys 
wouldn't get kind of drunk, but it wasn't a

30:48.302 --> 30:53.829
problem. First of all, you didn't have any 
automobiles. An automobile was the exception. I

30:59.817 --> 31:04.503
had 32 times 2 is 64 plus 16 times 2 is 32. I had 100 men 
in my unit. And as I recall, it was one automobile.

31:13.186 --> 31:15.670
There was an old boy named Lee Ravey from Amarillo. 
He was a little bit advanced in age. He was probably

31:18.254 --> 31:21.058
a year old to be a senior and so on. And he had a car. So 
you weren't going to be a DWI very often. All right.

31:25.746 --> 31:28.590
Other than hard liquors, what were some other 
famous places? Well...
