WEBVTT

00:02.022 --> 00:08.873
South Vietnam can shove the United States around 
for 10 years?

00:19.108 --> 00:22.313
They don't have a military that amounts to a hill of 
beans. North Vietnam doesn't either. Who fed

00:26.380 --> 00:29.384
North Vietnam on these people? China? But we 
wouldn't dare go to North Vietnam or beyond a

00:31.283 --> 00:36.972
certain level here. We wouldn't bring China into 
it. We would not bring China into it. China was in

00:40.117 --> 00:45.505
it.

00:45.525 --> 00:59.687
The reason people protested is because they were 
frustrated

00:45.525 --> 00:59.687
and angry and not just a little put out that they 
lost their sons or whatever. I believe that a lot of

01:01.810 --> 01:17.766
those people who protested why I hated it at the 
time and why that kind of thing grates on any

01:01.810 --> 01:17.766
military man.

01:17.786 --> 01:21.029
I understand at least why they did it. And I suppose 
there were probably a lot of military people the

01:21.049 --> 01:31.159
last two or three years of that war wanted to march

01:21.049 --> 01:31.159
because of the stupidity. the way we approached 
it, because of the cost that we laid down for it. And

01:38.629 --> 01:42.534
we still ended up with a fistful of nothing. And all 
we got out of Vietnam was a bunch of dead soldiers

01:42.554 --> 01:46.759
and a black wall.

01:50.324 --> 01:51.966
And that's a price that stinks.

02:50.519 --> 02:54.002
You were talking about the military. The command 
was thinking of, what do you think of the fact that

02:55.484 --> 03:06.675
when they were first going in, that initially the 
CIA and the military were completely opposed to

02:55.484 --> 03:06.675
it. They said there was no way to either win or there 
was no strategic objectives in that particular

03:06.695 --> 03:13.722
theater. It wasn't that important. It wasn't 
worth the effort. It was about 63, 64 when they were

03:15.964 --> 03:19.227
talking about it. Then at 65, when the Marines 
landed with 50,000 men, they were told at that

03:19.612 --> 03:28.501
time, you know, they weren't told. What they said 
was, I'm not too certain exactly what our

03:28.561 --> 03:33.827
objective is. But what they thought was, we'll go 
in there with 50,000 and scare the snot out of these

03:34.588 --> 03:41.235
people. We're going to get a lot of this nonsense 
stopped just by our sheer numbers. the military

03:46.730 --> 03:52.836
mindset of an Oriental, they don't care if they 
fight 5,000 or five.

03:56.940 --> 04:01.665
They are a unique critter. And that's the hardest 
thing for Americans to go against. That's the

04:05.228 --> 04:08.071
reason we had so much trouble in the Second World 
War with Japs. We couldn't imagine the things that

04:09.473 --> 04:11.995
they would live through.

04:15.974 --> 04:23.263
We could not fathom the things those people would, 
you know, the lengths they would go to. They would

04:25.245 --> 04:27.368
live worse than animals.

04:30.271 --> 04:36.599
And they would fight and die for old mother 
country. See, that's a mindset completely

04:36.679 --> 04:40.463
different than America. We don't want to die for 
old mother country. We want to live for it. Matter

04:45.438 --> 04:48.703
of fact, Patton even said it. He said, Patton, 
you're not a hero because you go out there and die

04:48.723 --> 04:54.331
for your country. You make that other son of a bitch 
die for his country. That was Patton's words. You

05:00.761 --> 05:07.271
want to go out there and make him die for his 
country, make a hero out of him. We just, boy, we

05:07.291 --> 05:11.277
have the hardest time with an oriental mind And we 
assume certain things about them. It's not true.

05:18.628 --> 05:20.531
We create a lot of problems for ourselves.

05:23.716 --> 05:35.774
I don't know how many people, if you saw ten 
Orientals walking down the street, your natural

05:23.716 --> 05:35.774
conditioning after what you've seen in the movies 
and all is that at least nine of them know karate.

05:35.794 --> 05:39.880
When all they are really maybe is Nikon salesmen. 
But we assume certain things, and we act a certain

05:42.172 --> 05:47.300
way because of that assumption. Same things 
happen in the Japanese, and same things happen in

05:47.320 --> 05:56.073
Vietnam, Korea.

05:56.093 --> 05:59.758
We think we're going to do a certain thing, and we 
don't do it. And the worst part of that is the

05:59.778 --> 06:06.809
politicians are doing a lot of the assuming.

06:06.829 --> 06:07.690
We have people... in very strong, powerful 
positions that don't have the foggiest notion of

06:08.277 --> 06:20.212
the people they're dealing with. And yet, they're 
gonna carry out policies that they don't even

06:20.232 --> 06:26.020
understand. So, it was bad intelligence or just 
not listening to the intelligence? I think it was a

06:34.651 --> 06:36.073
lack of intelligence. lack of intelligence 
people than a lot of our politicians that are

06:36.830 --> 06:42.655
elected people. For instance, we elect somebody 
from Texas to go represent us in Washington. Now

06:49.981 --> 06:57.247
the person that we know of here in Texas that we 
elect, do you elect that man based on his military

06:49.981 --> 06:57.247
background? Do you elect him on the basis of how 
successful he is in business? Do you elect him on

07:06.597 --> 07:08.939
the basis of how charismatic he is? Do we elect him? 
We just go through his college background, his

07:12.083 --> 07:17.548
educational background. Do we do it on that? 
Almost every one of those with the exception of the

07:20.711 --> 07:24.855
military bid. We don't care about that. We're 
going to do it more on his charismatic comportment

07:26.837 --> 07:36.267
and his ability to function as a businessman. more 
rapidly than any other thing. Isn't that about

07:39.362 --> 07:40.083
right? Now we're going to send him to Washington 
and he's going to sit up there and deal in all these

07:42.305 --> 07:47.709
things around the world. We had a political pot 
full of them up there in Washington all during

07:50.211 --> 07:59.760
those ten years of Vietnam.

08:03.303 --> 08:05.865
How many of those people had one iota of military 
background. Now, this is what I'm talking about,

08:10.031 --> 08:14.796
the lack of intelligence. If I said to you, Benny,

08:14.816 --> 08:23.485
I've got a little project I need blown up.

08:26.668 --> 08:33.135
Now, if your expertise doesn't happen to be in 
explosives, I'm just going to hand you the caps and

08:26.668 --> 08:33.135
the charges and I'm going to tell you where I want 
it, I want this thing blown out of there, and you go

08:33.402 --> 08:39.627
out there and take care of it. Would you go do that? 
I'm sure I'd think about it, yeah. You'd think

08:44.932 --> 08:50.957
about it, because I told you and I was your 
superior, and you'd think about going and doing

08:44.932 --> 08:50.957
it. But you'd also have enough common sense to say, 
wait a minute, tell me something about this. What

08:57.583 --> 08:59.785
makes this go off? If you didn't know, you'd be 
pretty stupid not to ask. But what if you went next

09:04.908 --> 09:07.411
door and asked my neighbor?

09:11.155 --> 09:16.300
And he happened to know all about electronics and 
absolutely nothing about explosives. But he told

09:16.320 --> 09:18.563
you what he thought. And based on what he told you to 
do and the fact that I gave you the direction, you

09:18.583 --> 09:26.111
went out there to do it. And you not only blew that 
thing out of there, but yourself and a bunch of

09:26.131 --> 09:31.236
neighbors with it. Now, I'm the one who gave the 
direction. Do they come to me and say, why did you

09:37.425 --> 09:43.011
tell that boy and not know that he'd know how to do 
it? Well, it's not my fault. That guy told him how to

09:43.952 --> 09:47.215
do it. Now, he goes to jail, and I'm still sitting in 
my office. That's what happens in Washington

09:54.223 --> 10:00.309
quite often.

10:00.329 --> 10:02.792
We have people who will ask other people who have 
about the same amount of experience maybe in a

10:03.346 --> 10:07.431
given area that they do. How many politicians do 
you suppose were in politics to escape going to

10:10.014 --> 10:16.682
Vietnam?

10:28.596 --> 10:33.302
I just, I guess my frustration is that I know

10:35.948 --> 10:54.954
of so many of the different senators

10:35.948 --> 10:54.954
that would stand up and say things about the war

10:35.948 --> 10:54.954
that they had no experience to understand what was 
going on. Yet Senator Iannui, who knew what it was

10:55.635 --> 11:04.808
to fight a war and lost an arm and so on, he would say 
certain things And they'd ignore him. And I'm not

11:09.329 --> 11:12.392
just saying him, but many like him. It's the guys 
who have the voice of experience in that given area

11:12.412 --> 11:23.884
that were saying things that they should have 
listened to. Whether we agree with what they were

11:23.904 --> 11:26.046
saying or not. We ought to know where they're 
coming from to say such a thing. But see, if I say

11:30.651 --> 11:33.073
something that you disagree with, If you don't 
talk to me about it and find out why I say that,

11:33.948 --> 11:41.238
you're not going to understand. You'll just sit 
there and disagree.

11:46.465 --> 11:50.591
And we'll never reach that point where we have this 
understanding. And if we don't understand,

11:52.153 --> 11:58.301
there's not much grounds for appreciation 
either. Respect.

12:01.546 --> 12:03.128
And I have very little respect for some of

12:03.479 --> 12:08.104
them. Because there were a number that backed Jane 
Fonda doing what she did.

12:18.356 --> 12:22.461
That's a dangerous game.

12:22.481 --> 12:22.861
I knew it. He said some things that I disagree with. 
But at least I understand part of what he's saying.

12:30.530 --> 12:37.400
And in order for me to understand all of what he's 
saying, I'd have to sit down and talk

12:30.530 --> 12:37.400
to him. But quite often, when a direction's given, 
the guy who gives the direction doesn't give the

12:37.420 --> 12:47.936
instruction. And he insulates himself with 
neighbors and other people, other than soldiers,

12:47.956 --> 12:58.131
to take the heat when things blow up in his face. And 
they're the connivers that are just frosted.

13:02.947 --> 13:07.992
And how much of that was responsible for all that 
went on in Vietnam, God only knows. But entirely

13:09.113 --> 13:10.173
too much. You've always got people who are 
concerned about being re-elected. And they'll do

13:16.199 --> 13:20.603
and say anything to be re-elected. And they're the 
ones I have no respect

13:20.623 --> 13:25.948
for. Regardless of why Lyndon Johnson, whatever 
motivated him, There's a raft of reasons, but part

13:32.579 --> 13:37.325
of the reason, Lyndon Johnson didn't run again. 
Because of Vietnam.

13:43.594 --> 13:50.703
So, I take my hat off to a man that at least says, I 
cannot stomach this any longer.

13:53.848 --> 13:58.334
And walked

13:53.848 --> 13:58.334
away. Then those that'll sit there and run and lie 
and do whatever...

14:15.104 --> 14:17.386
the common soldier. It was like when you were 
there. You did what you were told to do.

14:23.372 --> 14:34.363
But the reason the common soldier, even in Nazi 
Germany, the reason the common soldier continued

14:23.372 --> 14:34.363
to fight and die is because he had a certain faith in 
the command. That faith in our command started to

14:36.145 --> 14:42.110
deteriorate in the mid to late 60s. And by 70, And 
on. It was shot. Nobody trusted him. How would you

14:49.779 --> 14:51.001
like to have been there then? Not after Tet. After, 
well, during Vietnamization, I wouldn't have

14:55.891 --> 14:59.077
wanted to have been there.

15:02.424 --> 15:06.492
Because then everybody, they were pulling troops 
out. They're still fighting, and then you're just

15:07.552 --> 15:11.538
going to die for absolutely nothing. You've got 
people, the next unit's being pulled back to the

15:11.558 --> 15:16.025
States, and you're still there having a fight. And 
you're dying. See, you're almost in a position

15:19.731 --> 15:24.598
where it's a dying situation. At least if you think 
you're dying for something. During the Second

15:29.546 --> 15:33.492
World War, our guys were dying, but they knew what 
they were dying for. And that was the frustrating

15:34.062 --> 15:36.364
factor of Vietnam. We were, you know, they were 
never told. I mean, our own government never said

15:39.768 --> 15:42.951
we had a specific direction. What are we trying to 
do? So the guys get the feeling that they're

15:45.213 --> 15:53.322
literally in a dying situation and have no 
knowledge why their life is required. You feel

15:55.244 --> 16:00.289
like the government leadership in general just 
betrayed the soldiers?

16:03.965 --> 16:29.297
knowingly betrayed their trust yeah i do because i 
think too many people got involved in a situation

16:03.965 --> 16:29.297
where it was face saving time and they would rather 
save face than admit their error and cancel it save

16:03.965 --> 16:29.297
at least some lives

16:03.965 --> 16:29.297
because you know ultimately that's exactly what 
happened everybody kept rattling and shaking

16:30.037 --> 16:42.312
until it finally got to the point it was obvious 
that we didn't have the facility for continuing

16:30.037 --> 16:42.312
it, much less the heart for it, and we were beat. So 
we withdrew, and we left those people, and part of

16:42.332 --> 16:49.260
them were clamoring for that freedom, and they got 
it. Now, the thing that happened was the exact

16:50.702 --> 16:58.812
thing that people like Jane Fonda clamored for. 
Get out and let them run their own business. That's

17:01.354 --> 17:02.154
their business. Let them do it. That's what they 
want to do. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So we did. And

17:06.179 --> 17:07.440
millions died. Millions died. That country was 
raped.

17:18.311 --> 17:25.619
And Cambodia, which we were forbidden to go across 
these sacred borders, they were raped. They got

17:27.501 --> 17:28.562
what they asked for.

17:32.238 --> 17:33.980
But we picked up part of the ticket. And our psyche 
continues to pay for it as a country. People scream

17:42.449 --> 17:45.312
about, we shouldn't do this, we shouldn't do that. 
What are they attached to it every time? Like

17:47.594 --> 17:48.495
Vietnam. Now you tell me. We're not navel-gazing. 
We don't look at the world anymore with a view

17:53.921 --> 18:00.388
towards accomplishing anything. What we look at 
it, it seems to me now, is with an eye that we never

18:01.246 --> 18:09.456
want to be put in that position again. So you feel 
the Vietnam syndrome is affecting foreign

18:09.476 --> 18:13.140
policy? Oh, absolutely. Just like Watergate 
Center. That thing continues to affect

18:17.826 --> 18:19.888
everything. I mean, everything we do now has got to 
have this grand investigation attached to it.

18:25.515 --> 18:25.976
Everything.

18:29.099 --> 18:29.700
Oh, man. Of course, we're all... I think you 
unplugged the lamp. Unplug that other thing. No.

18:40.479 --> 18:44.084
Pause.

18:44.105 --> 18:49.232
Well, you

18:44.105 --> 18:49.232
know... I think we have a lot of good people in 
politics.

18:59.549 --> 19:03.114
we get into a fighting situation. I would 
certainly like to know that whoever, I'd like to

19:03.134 --> 19:14.349
know whoever's doing the directing has something 
specific in mind. And I'll give you a case in point

19:14.369 --> 19:18.775
of the futility of the Bay of Pigs. That thing was 
ramshackle from the beginning to its disastrous

19:19.616 --> 19:24.142
end. And Vietnam is a reflection of that same 
thing.

19:32.607 --> 19:37.012
And we went through three presidents during that 
fiasco.

19:41.298 --> 19:44.141
And not one of them seemed to have any better grasp 
than the other. It was like a booger on the finger.

19:46.304 --> 19:48.687
You just sit there and keep flicking it, and that 
sucker won't come off. And not one of them said,

19:51.070 --> 19:57.358
come here, General, and wipe it on his chest along 
with all of his other confetti. You know, they

19:57.378 --> 19:59.340
didn't do that. Now I want somebody, a president or 
whoever it is, to have the coyotes to stand up and

20:01.227 --> 20:08.557
say, this stinks, get out.

20:11.861 --> 20:12.802
We just keep dancing. Everybody wants to be 
re-elected. That's what stinks about politics.

20:18.570 --> 20:28.743
Your life is insignificant in light of my 
importance in Washington. Bullshit.

20:33.813 --> 20:36.296
The day will come when you'll have your sons.

20:40.921 --> 20:53.355
How are you going to feel when they're called to go 
down to

20:40.921 --> 20:53.355
the canal to fight? Because just as sure as God made 
politics and countries, there's going to be a

20:53.375 --> 21:01.744
conflict down there.

21:07.141 --> 21:30.116
I'd certainly like to know that the one that's in 
charge has the brass of Harry Truman to stand up and

21:07.141 --> 21:30.116
say, we're going to do it, and we're going to do it to 
end

21:07.141 --> 21:30.116
it. The way the world is today, the thing that they 
could do to affect it more than anything else and

21:36.419 --> 22:01.015
understand who Jesus Christ is. Stop thinking 
about fighting. Start thinking about living. The

22:02.216 --> 22:02.917
lethal potential is phenomenal. It's just 
phenomenal. We just keep flirting with it.

22:10.945 --> 22:12.727
be nice. My kids' kids

22:12.747 --> 22:25.143
could grow up and accomplish all God has intended.

22:25.163 --> 22:36.818
That you and your children could grow up being able 
to travel

22:25.163 --> 22:36.818
anywhere in the world and know that God's in charge 
of you instead of someone else.

22:49.015 --> 22:52.191
It's probably going to do it.
