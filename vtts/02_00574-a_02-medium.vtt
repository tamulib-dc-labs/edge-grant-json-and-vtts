00:01.988 --> 00:05.733
Well, let me talk a minute about the book talk. I say 
in my book that there are any number of ways of

00:05.753 --> 00:09.437
giving a book talk. And if you want to test how 
successful your method is, see how many people

00:10.799 --> 00:17.667
came in to ask for the book after you talked about 
it. That's the test. It wasn't, were you Helen

00:18.948 --> 00:26.598
Hayes or Catherine Cornell, but how many people 
came in to get the book. I have the theory that you

00:28.620 --> 00:30.983
ought to write The book talked down, 
double-spaced. Cut it first. Pick out an incident

00:33.851 --> 00:36.853
in a book that you're crazy about. Don't talk about 
it if you don't like it. If you're just mad about the

00:39.356 --> 00:46.583
book, you pick out one little incident in that 
book, preferably not at the end, that tells well.

00:47.043 --> 00:53.490
For instance, in The Count of Monte Cristo, early 
in the book, nobody in high school much is reading

00:47.043 --> 00:53.490
The Count of Monte Cristo, but years ago they did. 
Maybe in junior high, though. But in that first

00:56.152 --> 00:59.215
chapter, where he gets put in the Chateau Deep, and 
digs into this, here's this fella digging and

01:00.477 --> 01:11.387
tries to dig to him and finds out it's an old priest 
who's been digging for three years and just dug

01:00.477 --> 01:11.387
into another cell when he thought he was at the 
wall. Then the two men work together, and to tell it

01:12.247 --> 01:17.212
quickly, he goes in one more and finds the priest 
dead. And he gets out of the chateau deep by taking

01:18.653 --> 01:22.497
the place of the dead man. He put the dead man's body 
in his cell with his face to the wall and the old cap

01:23.137 --> 01:29.843
on his head, and he gets in the shroud. And they 
throw him in the ocean, and just as he's about to

01:30.548 --> 01:36.297
die, he reaches down and cuts his rope and comes to 
the surface. Well, that is a perfect example of a

01:36.638 --> 01:44.991
part of a book that has an ending, a good 
introduction, and moves along. But take the scene

01:45.031 --> 01:49.839
anywhere, as I say, preferably not at the end. But 
it has to carry you along and have a satisfactory

01:49.859 --> 01:53.805
little ending to it. And in this, you're trying to 
give the reader a slice of the pie so good that he

01:54.983 --> 02:01.232
will want to eat the whole pie. You're trying to 
sell him the pie by telling him what it's like. So

02:06.659 --> 02:12.727
you cut this little scene and give it, and then type 
it. And when you type it, it should come out about

02:12.747 --> 02:16.693
four and a half pages double spaced. That's a good 
average length of a book, though. About four and a

02:19.497 --> 02:22.020
half pages double spaced. My reason for typing it 
is this. You've got it through time and eternity.

02:29.876 --> 02:34.502
And next year, when the new ninth grade comes in, 
you've got a book talk ready. Ten, ten minutes.

02:36.625 --> 02:37.205
Just read it over. You don't have to read the book 
again because you have read it. And this book talk

02:40.390 --> 02:42.352
will recall it to you. And you'll know exactly what 
you want to say. And you don't have to do anything

02:44.515 --> 02:50.303
but stare around in the old sermon bow, bring this 
up and read it and drink. And if you write all your

02:51.177 --> 02:57.527
talks out like this, in a short while you'll have 50 
talks in two or three years. You can fit any

02:57.547 --> 03:01.072
situation and do it with a few moments notice. You 
can sit down at the first of the year and read your

03:01.874 --> 03:09.165
whole collection over in an hour or an hour and a 
half. And then you're ready for the school year. Do

03:13.131 --> 03:16.436
you tie that little four and a half pages in with the 
plot of the book? I take it, I tell enough. about

03:19.477 --> 03:21.981
what has happened that they can follow this scene. 
Don't tell the whole story. Don't wear them out.

03:26.228 --> 03:31.796
Just be able to follow these characters through 
this scene. Now I can give you, and I say that most

03:31.816 --> 03:37.205
people do not talk well, speak well 
extemporaneously. They say, well, he was gone

03:43.473 --> 03:46.016
down this road in the country. Oh, but I forgot to 
tell you that his grandfather had been here. Well,

03:51.643 --> 03:52.604
a good father. Now, this is the way a lot of people 
speak except for Anderson. If you take the words of

03:57.550 --> 04:04.198
the author, he was so good he got published. As real 
smooth And if you learn to say it so it doesn't sound

04:06.541 --> 04:16.575
memorized, as I said this morning, say, uh, and 
the, and don't hit them as your pronouns, and say,

04:06.541 --> 04:16.575
now how would this person have said this? And say it 
over in your mind, and you say it like he did. Nobody

04:20.380 --> 04:21.882
knows it's memorized. And it makes such a smooth 
performance. I'm going to do it, but it's

04:24.225 --> 04:31.435
perfectly possible to do this and not sound 
memorized. You're just that, like you tell

04:31.853 --> 04:34.996
stories to children. When children's librarians 
tell stories, they memorize it. But it doesn't

04:38.519 --> 04:40.500
sound memorized. You become this person, and you 
disappear. The object is to be so good that nobody

04:43.743 --> 04:46.545
sees you. They just see Franzenoah looking at the 
flowers, and they don't see you. So that any

04:50.589 --> 04:57.915
gesture, any funny stuff that you do, any loud 
noise, calls attention to you, and that's the

04:50.589 --> 04:57.915
reason it's wrong. Because you got off the stage. 
And just let this story live. Here's

05:02.077 --> 05:14.192
the

05:02.077 --> 05:14.192
way I'm used to doing it. The Pratt Library has 
printed a thing called Speaking of Books. And

05:24.304 --> 05:30.852
they've got 290 books listed under such titles as 
If You Want to Read a Movie. how to impress your

05:31.625 --> 05:57.767
teacher geared to a man's taste for the female of 
the species, the lipstick to keep you up at night so

05:31.625 --> 05:57.767
laugh a little before today for the nonconformist 
which is printed upside down to keep you calm about

05:31.625 --> 05:57.767
private and public people out of this world now 
There are about 16 young adult workers, so that is

05:57.950 --> 06:03.417
290 book talks that they've got ready. They go in 
couples. And when they go in to give the book talks,

06:06.602 --> 06:11.328
each child is given one of these. He finds it on the 
seat. And you say, that we're from Grant Library.

06:19.399 --> 06:22.303
We've come to talk to you about just enjoying 
books. Now, you have a list on the seat of your

06:22.975 --> 06:26.019
chair. Pick it up and get your pencil. Now, you may 
not want to use the pencil, which is just not weird.

06:29.764 --> 06:33.749
For the time this period's over, I think you're 
going to want to read some of these books. And you

06:34.410 --> 06:36.853
check the ones we talk about that sound 
interesting. If they don't sound interesting,

06:36.893 --> 06:38.755
don't check them. Use your list. But we'd like to 
work out with you a little game called Stump the

06:40.558 --> 06:45.364
Experts. Now, we haven't read all these books, but 
we've read a lot of them. And they're numbered.

06:50.971 --> 06:51.852
Let's look at the list. Here's

06:53.502 --> 07:01.498
one called Geared to a Man's Taste. And number 95 is 
Williams the Wooden Horse. And in this, this is a

07:05.306 --> 07:13.182
story of some prisoners of war who were English who 
were in this German prison from which nobody can

07:05.306 --> 07:13.182
escape possibly. and how they tried to dig a tunnel 
under a barbed wire fence with police dogs and the

07:14.107 --> 07:23.520
guards and all the other things to escape through 
that tunnel. And you wouldn't believe what they

07:23.540 --> 07:24.862
did. How they'd dig that dirt and hide it in, they'd 
cut off the pants legs in summer and make bags and to

07:24.942 --> 07:33.094
conceal the dirt, put it in the bags made of the 
bottoms of the trousers, bring it in, and dispose

07:33.074 --> 07:43.721
of it under the house or down the john or something 
like that to make room to keep digging this tunnel.

07:43.741 --> 07:44.784
And how one day it fell in. Well, I'm not going to 
tell you about it, but that is this one. Now, here's

07:47.010 --> 07:49.075
one called... to keep you up at night, and here's 
one of Hitchcock's stories that you like, you've

07:49.898 --> 08:02.872
seen him on television, but I'll pick out, calling 
attention to the love story here, for the girl

07:49.898 --> 08:02.872
says, tell just a bit about a love story. Now say, 
look at the section you like, and call out a number,

08:02.952 --> 08:09.940
and see if you can stop us. And if we find something 
we haven't read, we say, well, you got me. I've read

08:15.706 --> 08:18.910
reviews of it, but I haven't actually read it, I'll 
tell you something about it. But going through it

08:20.105 --> 08:22.628
this way, then they all want to get in on that. And 
this makes them look at the list. And they suddenly

08:24.730 --> 08:26.573
realize it's a real good list. Then you say, but I 
want to stop and talk about number 13, Wuthering

08:27.033 --> 08:31.038
Heights. Then go back and do this. So that in one 
period, we talk for a period, and do a class or two

08:34.702 --> 08:42.391
classes together in the library. Then you set 
these kids out with about 20 books under the belts.

08:50.530 --> 09:15.846
many of which they want to read and you gave two or 
three book talks during that period but you talked

08:50.530 --> 09:15.846
about the others in these thumbnail sketches so 
that they went out of there without now let me tell

08:50.530 --> 09:15.846
you you don't have to go into it on this elaborate 
scale if you have only ten books that you're going

08:50.530 --> 09:15.846
to consider just make ten mimeograph a list of ten 
books but number them they don't know the alphabet

08:50.530 --> 09:15.846
but many can count

08:50.530 --> 09:15.846
laughter And if you want to get them to come and 
quickly with it, they can call out the numbers, you

09:15.826 --> 09:23.175
see, and everybody can do this. But you couldn't do 
it without that. But if you're going into the room

09:25.057 --> 09:34.087
and you know only ten books, write them down, get 
them down on the typewriter, mimeograph, give

09:25.057 --> 09:34.087
everybody the list. Then he's got a list of ten 
books to come and read with you, you see. But at his

09:38.112 --> 09:40.855
first, two or three book talks, with a lot of 
thumbnail sketches. So they go out with a lot of

09:43.188 --> 09:45.854
books to read. And if you're in a school library, 
put the books you're going to talk about up on the

09:45.875 --> 09:50.185
desk if you can. And if you've got multiple copies 
and you think they're going to read, do this. And

09:55.258 --> 09:56.160
stop possibly 10 minutes before the period's up 
and let them check them out. It's smart to let them

10:00.673 --> 10:03.416
check them out while the iron is hot. If you say come 
in at 4 o'clock and get the books, they possibly

10:04.337 --> 10:07.680
won't get there. But if you're willing to stop and 
not only check books out, if you've got a student

10:07.700 --> 10:23.815
aide or two there that can check them out, you get 
back in the stacks substituting for the ones that

10:07.700 --> 10:23.815
you can't supply so that you send everybody 
possible out of there with a book to read. Any other

10:23.835 --> 10:25.236
questions on this? And in the address, if you want 
to look at the Speaking of Books list, it doesn't

10:27.494 --> 10:32.682
have to be this big.

10:35.446 --> 10:51.751
Let me see

10:35.446 --> 10:51.751
if I can picture find a smaller one.

10:53.073 --> 10:54.936
Here's one with the Charlie Brown. sequence on it 
about books. It's funny. And the kids can open it up

10:57.796 --> 11:08.211
like this, you see, and it still has... Now, I don't 
like an unannotated list as a rule because the kids

10:57.796 --> 11:08.211
can't have one. But in this case, since you are 
talking about the books, you couldn't possibly

11:08.251 --> 11:15.761
have an annotated list of 290 books. But you can 
list them like this for this talk. And ordinarily,

11:19.466 --> 11:24.653
I would annotate them, but you don't have to do this 
since you're there and talking about them. And as

11:25.409 --> 11:30.617
she says, Dallas can give you a lot of good material 
on this, as well as Grant. Anyone else?

11:39.970 --> 11:41.092
That you think they can read. Don't give them 
money. You know they can't read. Unless... You

11:46.604 --> 11:57.558
have a very accelerated college-going class, and 
you say, I don't know whether this is too difficult

11:46.604 --> 11:57.558
or not, but I'm going to try it because I've 
understood that you can read very difficult

11:46.604 --> 11:57.558
books. If you find it boring, I can stop and do 
something else. And then they'll try awfully hard

12:00.622 --> 12:07.211
to get it, don't you know? Anxious for quiet...

12:16.675 --> 12:43.039
I

12:16.675 --> 12:43.039
said,

12:16.675 --> 12:43.039
I need you. I almost had to speak to you. But it's 
over. It's over. It's over. I'm with my men. Come

12:44.741 --> 12:44.901
on. Come on, come on. Can I wake up some morning?

12:51.404 --> 13:14.880
And

12:51.404 --> 13:14.880
did you ever give up the rise of discipline that is a 
month-fading shadow? Out on a new horizon, do you

13:14.900 --> 13:15.661
miss him? Emotions of a distant heroine? And if the 
secret that carries you on here was that my heart of

13:16.302 --> 13:17.704
metal? No, it didn't serve him. It

13:18.185 --> 13:32.577
was not part of you. It's only me. This is something 
I'm not sure of. From my dreams, the next to wonder,

13:33.580 --> 13:35.063
I taste the pride of a civilized love.

13:39.127 --> 13:54.823
Thank

13:39.127 --> 13:54.823
you. Thank

13:54.803 --> 14:11.293
you. Don't

14:11.273 --> 14:31.937
be concerned, it will not harm you. It's only you 
who's doing something I'm not sure of. Cause my

14:33.018 --> 14:34.279
dream is one day, I need to rise to the world of love. 
I need to rise to the world of love. Thank

14:35.000 --> 14:58.307
you.

15:06.995 --> 15:34.161
I

15:06.995 --> 15:34.161
just want to say goodbye through my heart. Look 
into my eyes. And maybe I will understand. How long

15:35.141 --> 15:35.702
I've got your hand. You

15:36.830 --> 15:58.211
see,

15:36.830 --> 15:58.211
I

15:36.830 --> 15:58.211
had thought that you might love me. So you thought 
you'd

15:58.231 --> 16:02.415
see me. of

16:03.239 --> 16:17.586
mountains and of hearts so full of love and the 
dreams that you should share.

16:47.300 --> 17:06.570
And so I

16:47.300 --> 17:06.570
know

16:47.300 --> 17:06.570
a breeze before you go.

17:06.590 --> 17:07.111
Take my hand for water. Explain it to me once again. 
Just the sake

17:13.102 --> 17:40.408
of my broken

17:13.102 --> 17:40.408
heart. Thank

17:41.165 --> 17:47.174
you. Thank you.

18:13.598 --> 18:39.318
Well,

18:13.598 --> 18:39.318
I'm a little king on the hill, where I saw the cow and 
her ewes. Well, I'm a little king on the hill where I

18:39.338 --> 18:40.720
saw the cow and her ewes. I'll

18:41.290 --> 19:03.773
chill my booze if you fill up my jug. That's what 
I'll do. I'll chill my booze if you fill up my jug.

19:05.075 --> 19:05.475
That's what I'll do. I

19:07.025 --> 19:29.936
hear you sing in the wild. I can hear you through the 
wild night. And the birds just call my name. It's

19:32.405 --> 19:51.342
still on the line. I know I need a strong vacation, 
but it don't look like things. And

19:53.347 --> 20:18.225
if there's so much that sounds off, I'll never 
stand to stay. And I need you more than I want you.

20:18.986 --> 20:19.627
And I want you more than I need. And the woods just 
fall away. It's still.

20:29.898 --> 20:52.986
And

20:29.898 --> 20:52.986
I need you, Lord, won't you And

20:54.181 --> 21:13.595
I want you for all my life. And the witch is all I 
want. It's still all I want.

21:25.568 --> 21:51.813
The

21:25.568 --> 21:51.813
world

21:25.568 --> 21:51.813
is scattered all around us here. The puzzles that 
we have found and explored. Still has a sign just

21:52.734 --> 21:53.475
walking aboard. And here we stand. In hot blood's 
hand. We're playing round Susie. If

21:55.673 --> 22:12.955
I don't stay around. If I don't

22:12.975 --> 22:16.500
stay around.

22:21.340 --> 22:43.887
It's

22:21.340 --> 22:43.887
a world of time of tunes and prophecy. Still you're 
not content with something about

22:43.907 --> 22:50.094
me. But what very well I'll give you time. Where's

22:51.023 --> 23:18.503
the playground sushi? I just gotta let you go and 
play around. Where's the playground sushi? If I

23:19.945 --> 23:20.406
don't stay around. If

23:20.993 --> 23:39.162
I don't stay around. Where's the playground 
sushi? You're going to wonder where I'm at. ¶¶

23:40.838 --> 23:56.502
¶¶

24:16.225 --> 24:44.545
¶¶

24:16.225 --> 24:44.545
¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶

24:48.035 --> 24:52.982
Thank

24:48.035 --> 24:52.982
you. I'm

24:53.317 --> 25:17.605
gonna run, I'll have some fun, I know, just me and 
you, I'm not alone anymore. Come on, I can say, this

25:17.625 --> 25:18.546
is my new game, baby. Come on, yes, I know, I know, I 
can say, I'm gonna want you my life, my life, come on

25:18.566 --> 25:20.588
and be with me. Yeah. Thank

25:23.017 --> 25:36.705
you.

25:42.389 --> 26:09.219
I've

25:42.389 --> 26:09.219
felt that love once in my life, and I'll never, ever 
forget it. I've never had anybody love me before.

26:11.043 --> 26:31.235
For

26:11.043 --> 26:31.235
once, I have someone I owe to me. I'm not lonely 
anymore. For once, I say, this is mine. You can take

26:32.357 --> 26:32.677
it. Now that I know, and I know I can take it. For 
once, I have someone I owe to me. She'll

26:34.280 --> 27:03.342
be running

26:34.280 --> 27:03.342
She'll find a load of tape On the floor

27:38.422 --> 28:01.773
She'll

27:38.422 --> 28:01.773
be working. She brought me some love. And give me a 
voice. To see her, to see her, that holy voice.

28:08.527 --> 28:25.424
Oh,

28:08.527 --> 28:25.424
good Lord, that's all for the time I've been 
before. Oh, good Lord. She'll

28:26.617 --> 28:52.048
be sleeping. She'll turn softly and call my name 
out loud. Oh, and she'll cry just the thing I dream

28:52.989 --> 28:53.890
of.

28:57.869 --> 29:24.014
Though

28:57.869 --> 29:24.014
time and time are short, she doesn't know. She 
doesn't know. I don't really know. No, she doesn't

29:24.814 --> 29:25.395
know, I know.

29:32.817 --> 29:43.249
These

29:32.817 --> 29:43.249
made outside, though, the light's just a little 
bit strong for her.

29:48.615 --> 29:49.536
This one's good.

29:54.422 --> 30:00.348
This one would have been good, but it's blurred 
just a little bit. And these are both good, too.

30:02.551 --> 30:24.943
Yeah.

30:24.963 --> 30:25.604
Even if Melanie is in the shade. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 
Come back with again.

30:32.774 --> 30:40.323
Very, very good in much the same way that flowers 
for Algernon is good. If you enjoyed the one, I

30:40.343 --> 30:47.212
think you will enjoy the other.

30:47.232 --> 30:49.174
Excellent. Virginia actually saved my

30:49.194 --> 31:01.970
life. Thank you, Virginia. Tomorrow, please 
don't let me forget tomorrow. I probably will. To

31:09.004 --> 31:12.810
highlight some of these books, it's time for you to 
go. And I know some of you have classes. But on this

31:14.232 --> 31:22.745
last list that I gave you, don't let me forget to 
emphasize certain of these. Tell you which ones to

31:22.765 --> 31:27.132
check out first.
