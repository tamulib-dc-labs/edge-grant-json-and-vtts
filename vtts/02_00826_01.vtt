WEBVTT

00:01.955 --> 00:03.997
I was born and raised in Brazos County. My people 
settled in Brazos County in about 1872. My

00:10.725 --> 00:13.028
grandfather settled up on top of this hill. I am now 
83 years old. Okay, so that makes what year were you

00:22.319 --> 00:26.203
born in? 1891. And your full name is? Noah C. Cole. 
Well, Mr. Cole, you said your grandfather settled

00:32.363 --> 00:36.607
up there on the hill. What brought him to this area? 
They came from Alabama down here in Texas. I don't

00:43.134 --> 00:45.817
know if they were hunting, but I lied, I guess. 
That's a lie. What kind of occupation was your

00:47.258 --> 00:50.361
grandfather in? Farmers. Farmers and ranchers. 
So they just moved down here? Do you know what crops

00:57.068 --> 01:00.412
they grew or have any idea? Yes. People, when they 
first came here, this land wasn't settled in

01:02.587 --> 01:16.359
mostly cattle range, mostly cattle range and wild 
cattle and things like that, but they all produced

01:02.587 --> 01:16.359
crops, raised farm products. Cotton and corn and 
other things like that. Okay, so then is, you know,

01:21.664 --> 01:28.210
like when your father came along, what was his, did 
he do ranching too? Yes, he did ranching. He bought

01:29.851 --> 01:32.053
land and owned land. On the gin. Really? Yes. We 
have a gin down there, old gin down there that he

01:37.484 --> 01:41.389
bought. They raised considerable cotton.

01:46.597 --> 01:54.768
Of course at that time they didn't have the the 
machinery that we have today. We use horses and

01:54.908 --> 01:56.570
mules. And no up-to-date cultivators or anything 
like that. So you just stayed in this area then? And

02:07.020 --> 02:08.923
we had tenant farmers here. My daddy had a good many 
tenant farmers that raised cotton and corn. He

02:15.632 --> 02:20.399
accumulated quite a bit of land around. And

02:20.419 --> 02:27.068
so then as you grew up you just kind of fell in his 
footsteps? Yeah, I fell in his footsteps. And we

02:30.674 --> 02:37.643
was in eight miles, uh, well you might put it in six 
miles of A&M College. And one of my cousins that

02:39.885 --> 02:50.579
raised right up here on the other side of us, he was 
the director of A&M College at one time. D.S.

02:51.140 --> 02:51.540
Buchanan. So, um, did you attend school or did you? 
I attended the, uh, we had country schools at that

02:59.783 --> 03:05.770
time, and I went from the country schools here to 
Sam Houston State Normal. And I finished at Sam

03:07.592 --> 03:11.096
Houston State Normal in 1913.

03:13.880 --> 03:15.742
Taught school a good many years. Well, did you, did 
you marry later on then? Yes, I married after the

03:20.027 --> 03:29.638
World War I. I enlisted in World War I. I was in the 
World War I, and And when I came back from World War

03:30.327 --> 03:37.357
I, I married one of the neighbor girls around here.

03:45.209 --> 03:46.571
Let me get her name right.

03:51.038 --> 03:52.540
Clara Boykin Jones. That was my wife. Her people 
lived across the road. Yeah. I've known her all my

04:01.817 --> 04:03.019
life. So did y'all, did you bring your children? 
Did y'all have children? We didn't have any

04:08.805 --> 04:09.826
children. We didn't, unfortunately never had any 
children. And she died getting many years ago. Oh,

04:14.672 --> 04:16.694
okay. And I continued on to live here. I had lots of 
brothers and sisters. I had three brothers and two

04:22.041 --> 04:26.746
sisters. Oh. Well are they all still in this 
immediate area? They're all dead except me. Oh, so

04:32.590 --> 04:36.234
what did they, were your brothers involved in 
ranching too? Yes, my brother, well I had one, my

04:36.394 --> 04:46.704
older brother was a district clerk for Brazos 
County for many years, and he retired from that,

04:36.394 --> 04:46.704
but he's dead now. And I had one sister, taught 
school in the surrounding areas for years, and I

04:48.025 --> 04:54.551
did too. Oh, that's interesting. She was a teacher

04:56.862 --> 05:06.354
in Brown High for years. Do you have any idea what 
year she started teaching there? Oh, I don't know

05:10.800 --> 05:14.525
what year she started teaching, but she taught all 
of her life. And she was 87 years old, 85 years old

05:15.727 --> 05:21.134
when she died, sunshine cold. Well, you said you 
were into ranching and everything. What kind of

05:26.326 --> 05:32.435
changes has there been made since you started, you 
know, as far as technology and stuff like that?

05:32.455 --> 05:52.563
Well, it was mostly the ranching, and really from 
the ranching, as the country settled, as the

05:32.455 --> 05:52.563
people settled in here, they began to raise the 
crops of cotton and corn and things that went along

05:32.455 --> 05:52.563
with it. And we raised cotton and corn for years 
until we might say along, well,

05:56.262 --> 06:13.400
I believe I was still, we were still farming here in 
19, we might say 1915, 20. And I

06:13.420 --> 06:23.451
went to war in 1917, came back, still continue to 
farm, We had some mighty hard years later on. So

06:28.308 --> 06:31.073
speaking of those hard years, can you remember the 
Depression? Yes, I don't know exactly what year it

06:31.093 --> 06:35.421
was. I imagine from 1925 and what we'd call 1925 or 
1930, and there was some mighty hard, dry years. It

06:44.959 --> 06:46.722
didn't rain for two years. and our stock water oil 
would drop. We didn't have the tanks and things in

06:49.527 --> 06:53.171
there that we have now. We didn't have the wells. 
And the government came in, very good to us, helped

06:55.074 --> 07:00.981
us to build tanks, wells. Okay, well then later on 
in the late 30s, middle 30s, did the depression

07:03.344 --> 07:10.394
affect you, the national depression? Oh yes, I 
guess so to a certain extent. What, did y'all

07:13.297 --> 07:17.282
continue to farm, or did you have to find other 
work? Yes, we just continued to farm. We were right

07:18.063 --> 07:18.844
on. Okay. Did the government help you through 
that? Yes, the government helped. The

07:24.912 --> 07:32.623
government, I didn't, I wasn't needing any help at 
that time, but the government had WPA labor. They

07:33.384 --> 07:35.447
had to build some of the schoolhouses. And, not 
only that, we, and during Roosevelt

07:42.153 --> 07:50.986
administration, which one of those presidents, 
wasn't Teddy, was it, what was it, D. Franklin?

07:51.747 --> 07:52.248
Franklin. Franklin D. Roosevelt, I believe. We 
had what we, times and conditions were hard. We

08:03.264 --> 08:04.366
killed cattle. I killed calves and fired out of the 
head, hauled them over in the pasture. I killed

08:08.813 --> 08:10.455
young cows. We plowed up the cotton, destroyed it. 
Well, as you, you know, as you grew older and

08:17.691 --> 08:28.588
everything, can you remember any famous figures 
coming to, you know, Bryan College Station area,

08:17.691 --> 08:28.588
such as maybe politicians or something? Oh, yes, I 
do. There's one of my kinfolk, some of my kinfolk,

08:31.152 --> 08:36.760
W.S. Byrne, George Byrne, was Speaker of the 
House, was a representative. during some of those

08:41.975 --> 08:46.279
years, and now he's still alive, practicing law in 
Brown. Yeah.

08:51.083 --> 08:56.408
Oh, and I remember many,

08:51.083 --> 08:56.408
Law Henderson. I especially remember one man that 
was affiliated, that worked with the foreman

08:57.649 --> 09:05.276
class of people, that was Mr. Beeson. He was the 
county agent of Rattlers County. And he did work

09:10.055 --> 09:14.522
then that they're redoing right now. He killed 
cows. He taught us how to kill caves and cows and to

09:17.506 --> 09:22.373
process them. And we used the process at that time. 
We'd kill those caves and make them up in chili and

09:28.622 --> 09:35.813
can it. We had home canners. We'd can those stuff, 
can that stuff up, meats. Right here? Yes, in your

09:46.808 --> 09:47.969
own home. I have one of my old kennels here in my 
house right today.

09:56.721 --> 09:58.424
And we raised our hogs. We had our meat. We raised 
our vegetables. My wife was a great hand with the

10:02.189 --> 10:05.674
home demonstration agent. They canned 
everything we needed. We didn't have the At that

10:09.134 --> 10:13.478
time, we didn't have the deep freeze, you see. And 
then, of course, later on this time, come on down,

10:14.920 --> 10:20.545
we used the deep freeze. Okay, well, can you 
remember when the railroad came through Bryan

10:21.306 --> 10:26.371
County? No, I don't remember, but I had my 
grandfather, I had a bed that my grandfather

10:26.391 --> 10:35.719
brought over here to Milligan. It first stopped at 
the little town of Milligan down here. little

10:39.104 --> 10:44.310
college and but I don't remember what year it came 
through here. Okay so did it influence your your

10:45.891 --> 10:50.657
occupation your ranching occupation in any way? 
No not any more than just town built up and the first

10:50.777 --> 11:07.575
courthouse was established first court was here 
down here on about three miles down the road down

10:50.777 --> 11:07.575
here then they moved it on up And then they moved it 
on up to Boom, Boom, Boom. That's the town up there

11:12.125 --> 11:15.729
called Boom. Okay, well, for social activities, 
what type of did y'all engage in? Well,

11:20.895 --> 11:23.437
practically the same thing they do today. We had 
parties and things like that. We didn't have no

11:25.359 --> 11:32.287
automobiles until about 1917, a little after 
1917. Can you remember the first automobile that

11:32.988 --> 11:35.250
came? I remember the first one I got, and I was going 
to school in Huntsville when the doctor in

11:35.433 --> 11:45.742
Huntsville had a car, and he had, the only car he 
had, he had a dog. It always run ahead of that thing.

11:47.944 --> 11:54.189
When I came back from World War I, I had, I bought a 
1917 Ford, me and my brother. We said I wanted you in

11:54.429 --> 11:58.012
World War I. And I bought a 1917 Ford, and I've been 
buying Fords ever since.

12:05.690 --> 12:10.256
So then your social life was pretty much, was 
church an influence in your life? Yes, church. We

12:11.237 --> 12:19.147
had a church up here right up the road here, a pretty 
good Baptist church that was organized by my

12:11.237 --> 12:19.147
people. And I've been deacon in that church ever 
since I was large enough. My grandfather, my

12:26.897 --> 12:34.667
grandmother, my dad, my mother, several brothers 
and sisters were buried right up here side the

12:26.897 --> 12:34.667
road. Broughton High Tribal Baptist Church. OK. 
Well, so all of your folks were just relatively

12:38.488 --> 12:42.552
from around this same area? They just, they never? 
Well, they came all the, they came in from

12:43.653 --> 12:46.797
everywhere. My mother, I had one group she knew, 
different communities like Steep Hollow was a, we

12:46.857 --> 13:03.034
had kin folks in the Steep Hollow community, the 
Dansmans, the Peters. And all the old, old

13:03.706 --> 13:07.691
families that was originally here. My book, I have 
a book on those people that were sitting. So Mr.

13:15.301 --> 13:17.984
Peters is related to you then, is that? Mm-hmm. His 
grandfather, my grandmother's brothers and

13:18.725 --> 13:21.269
sisters.

13:25.414 --> 13:25.995
Oh, I see the connection now. Oh, okay. He was down 
the other day. We played dominoes, he and I and his

13:28.835 --> 13:35.802
brother and a fellow over there in college over 
there, Marco. We played dominoes. It was a Tuesday

13:38.184 --> 13:40.627
night. He and our partner, we played dominoes this 
past time. So what about Christmas time? Has

13:47.273 --> 13:50.196
Christmas changed any since you were younger? Oh, 
no, just about the same. We had parties to the

13:51.417 --> 13:56.342
community and things like that. One of the 
greatest things I can remember that affected all

13:57.537 --> 14:10.594
of us, we used to, years ago, the water proposition 
was a scarce proposition, and the lights, you see.

14:11.435 --> 14:26.734
We had to cut stone wood, cook on the stove, and my 
old home was right across the road, 240 acres over

14:11.435 --> 14:26.734
there. Well did the, speaking of lights and 
running water and everything, how did y'all cope?

14:32.853 --> 14:34.275
We didn't have lights and running water. How did 
y'all cope? We had well water systems. Okay, well

14:37.620 --> 14:55.067
then later on is... Then later on we, the governor 
kept to put in some tanks and during those hard

14:37.620 --> 14:55.067
times, you might call it during the Depression, 
I'd say during the Depression, he put in tanks and

14:56.802 --> 15:11.662
And of course as we telephones increased, the REA 
came in, and we of course all began to modernize our

14:56.802 --> 15:11.662
homes, you see. There's only one home in this 
community that I remember that I can say this

15:12.944 --> 15:18.872
offhand is still standing. That's a house right 
down there, a nice house, been well kept, but all

15:18.912 --> 15:24.379
the rest of the homes I've been torn down and 
rebuilt, you see. Okay, this house that doesn't

15:29.887 --> 15:34.272
have it, that is still the same, is anyone living in 
this house? No, it belongs to the Williams State

15:34.412 --> 15:40.519
down there, a big place down there. They've kept it 
up. No one's living in it, right? No one. They have

15:44.724 --> 15:45.805
it furnished. They come out and stay during the 
weekend and things like that. Big ranch on it.

15:50.931 --> 15:53.995
Okay, well this book, The Baron, is that the title 
of the book? That's the history of the Byrne

15:54.397 --> 15:57.541
family. Okay, how did that come to be written? Do 
you have any? Some of the Byrnes, they wanted to

16:01.505 --> 16:03.708
write it. There's a lady here in town. Okay, is that 
about your folks? Yeah, my people in there. My

16:10.676 --> 16:15.061
mother was, she was connected with the Byrnes. She 
was, this book was, they originally came from

16:15.962 --> 16:23.931
Alabama.

16:24.248 --> 16:32.319
And this Barron gives a live history of the Barron 
families and the different connections of all in

16:24.248 --> 16:32.319
the county.

16:35.383 --> 16:41.672
And she was one of the, she was a Soules. And that was 
one of the beginning of the Barron family, the

16:44.055 --> 16:49.783
Soules. So she was connected to the Barron's 
three? She connected to, we connected to the

16:52.307 --> 16:58.535
Barron's soldiers, and then everybody else in 
town, in the county. Todd's.

17:02.499 --> 17:04.321
So that book was just written by someone? The one 
with the family. Oh, okay. Well, do you remember,

17:07.665 --> 17:11.870
how about school? Was it, what did you think of 
school? Oh, well, school then was just like I

17:14.671 --> 17:17.796
taught school. School then was just about like it 
is. Well, it's of course more modernized now like

17:19.819 --> 17:22.743
that. We had out there, we had three teachers. We 
had three teachers, a principal and two

17:28.832 --> 17:33.920
assistants that taught school. I taught there 
several years, and then I taught in different

17:34.240 --> 17:38.306
communities. Okay, well, do you remember any of 
the people that You know, were your teachers, say,

17:42.768 --> 17:45.131
in school? Oh yeah, I remember I got

17:45.151 --> 17:55.424
students all around the country. Okay, well what 
about when you were a student? Do you remember any,

17:57.567 --> 18:01.952
like who was your teachers or principal at that 
time? Oh yes, one of our principal teachers I tell

18:02.012 --> 18:06.898
you was E.K. Barton. He was a Fine teacher. I 
believe he's dead now, but he had people living

18:10.508 --> 18:13.972
around overstate. He married into one of the 
families out there, married into the Jones

18:14.012 --> 18:21.919
families, and they've got people living around. 
Do you remember any of your other teachers or

18:21.939 --> 18:29.586
people that influenced you? Well,

18:29.606 --> 18:37.834
I can't recall too many of them right now that I went 
to school to. I remember the teachers more than I. I

18:38.354 --> 18:44.723
spent three years down at the hospital. I remember 
the Estill, President Estill down there, and

18:44.743 --> 18:52.134
different teachers down there. It's a normal, it 
was a normal at that time, and later on it was added,

18:53.495 --> 19:02.829
made into a college, you see, in 1913 when I 
graduated. It was a normal school, a teacher

19:03.049 --> 19:05.172
school. Well, when you were in, you know, at the 
same Houston Normal, was it, did you work at that

19:06.198 --> 19:12.885
time, or did you just go to college? I went to 
college, I boarded down there. Okay, what, did

19:15.248 --> 19:19.492
they have dormitory facilities? Yes, they had, 
no, they lived in private homes, most of them,

19:19.512 --> 19:25.138
different homes around there, boarding the 
students, you see. Well, what was your, how were

19:25.418 --> 19:29.082
you fixed up to stay there? I was, I was a 10 or 15 boy, 
The girl, well the girl had separate dormitories,

19:33.890 --> 19:39.717
separate homes, and the boys down there. What was 
your main college, your main course of study

19:41.599 --> 19:44.242
there? I took, well I don't know what you would call 
that. We had some manual training. We had,

19:55.916 --> 20:00.522
and

20:04.298 --> 20:09.624
Just a general education more for teachers.

20:12.848 --> 20:16.572
Sam Houston Normal was a normal to produce 
teachers. Oh, I see. Okay, so it was just more or

20:18.734 --> 20:20.897
less a teacher college. Yeah, it was a teacher 
college, and then later on it came into a

20:21.037 --> 20:28.465
regular... Began to offer more programs. More 
courses. It's a big school, isn't it? Yes, it is.

20:35.956 --> 20:39.701
Around the period of World War I, you mentioned 
that you enlisted and everything. Did you, how did

20:39.721 --> 20:43.065
that affect your life? Around World War I? World 
War I?

20:50.595 --> 21:01.189
Well, when we came back from World War I, I was in the 
Navy, and I got my discharge from Camden, New

20:50.595 --> 21:01.189
Jersey. Battleship I was waiting for the 
battleship Utah to go into commission. I got my

21:09.942 --> 21:18.132
discharge plan and came back and take my place 
right over in the community as I did beforehand.

21:22.057 --> 21:32.490
I done been to school you see then and I would get to 
teach some of the smaller schools, some of the

21:22.057 --> 21:32.490
schools around in the different parts of the 
counties, different county, Owen Grimes County,

21:33.145 --> 21:36.810
some over here. I taught right over here in the 
south of A&M College for three years. There's a

21:40.234 --> 21:42.637
place out there known as Union Hill.

21:46.261 --> 21:55.112
But we raised cattle and we had to fight the pest, 
the tick people and everything like that all

21:46.261 --> 21:55.112
through those things. Well what, how did y'all go 
about fighting it? What kind of problems did y'all

21:58.745 --> 22:02.009
have as y'all raised, tried to raise cattle and 
everything? We had what they called Texas fever

22:02.029 --> 22:05.312
ticks. And we, they kept cows that wasn't immune 
from it would die. And we had to, we built dipping

22:12.981 --> 22:25.675
vats and we dipped those cows for those ticks every 
two weeks. And we finally eliminated the fever

22:26.035 --> 22:28.498
ticks Yeah, in Texas. What did y'all use as a dip? Do 
you remember? We used arsenic. And just dipped the

22:35.149 --> 22:36.850
cattle in the arsenic? Yes, sir. We dipped those 
cows and run those cows through those dipping

22:37.611 --> 22:41.595
vats. We still got those dipping vats today. But we 
don't use them when we use spraying outfits now. We

22:47.220 --> 22:47.701
don't. We got rid of the fever tiki in Texas. A&M 
College used to have a fence around us where they

22:51.664 --> 22:56.489
called it tic proof. So many people keep ticks with 
that cross. Well did that, was there any other

23:01.870 --> 23:04.433
thing that plagued your cattle? Oh yeah, all kind 
of insects. And then we had the screwworms that's

23:06.355 --> 23:15.064
been put in just last few years, been one of the 
greatest things for the cattlemen we had. We, they

23:15.104 --> 23:18.347
eliminated the screwworm. How'd they go about 
doing that? Well they, they took, they caught

23:19.929 --> 23:23.933
these flies. You know, it was a male fly and a female 
fly that laid the eggs. And they treated, they

23:31.704 --> 23:35.971
caught these flies, they built the great big 
things around it. One of the bitches in Texas is

23:36.071 --> 23:38.054
around over there. And, and they sterilized, 
sterilized those flies, you see. And they spread

23:44.663 --> 23:45.725
them out. And they wouldn't hatch, you see.

23:51.605 --> 23:53.708
And that eliminated the school worms. We used to 
have to dock the worms every year. It was a

23:58.515 --> 24:00.718
proposition, a big proposition. That was one of 
the great benefits of the government. Did they

24:05.845 --> 24:07.507
come in and help y'all? Oh, they did that. Yeah, 
they helped in that dipping business. We had to dig

24:12.133 --> 24:13.896
those vats. We had a regular dipping inspector to 
see the people that lived there for 14 days. Were

24:22.148 --> 24:26.112
they, they were commissioned by the government to 
come out and do that? Well, then other men came in

24:26.132 --> 24:30.076
and helped you? I mean, how did y'all handle that? 
Did the men from the community get together? Well,

24:33.499 --> 24:34.801
we just went together and handled it. One father 
maybe take his own cows, drive his own cows there.

24:38.264 --> 24:45.792
Maybe some, each one drove his own cattle to the 
vats so they wouldn't get them mixed up, you see.

24:46.312 --> 24:51.177
Oh, how'd y'all get your cows to market, or did you 
market them, or? The railroad shipped to Dallas.

24:55.274 --> 24:56.956
Oh, through the railroad? Mm-hmm. We didn't have 
the, at first we didn't have the, we didn't have

24:57.798 --> 25:05.267
the, like we had that auction range and things like 
that, you see. That came on later on, you see. Well

25:09.052 --> 25:16.281
did the, we said, you mentioned when you were 
younger did the, about farming, did the boll

25:09.052 --> 25:16.281
weevil have any effect on the process? Oh yes, the 
boll weevil was one of the pests we had to deal with.

25:19.465 --> 25:22.108
It put the cotton farmer nearly out of business. 
And, of course, we fought the bull wheel just like

25:22.814 --> 25:28.661
we fought everything else, and they're still 
fighting. Well, did that affect your father

25:30.743 --> 25:33.326
specifically? Oh, yes, it affected everybody 
that lived there. If it wasn't for the bull wheel,

25:36.130 --> 25:50.627
we could make two bales cut to an acre, but the bull 
wheel, we different control methods are used and

25:36.130 --> 25:50.627
by cultivation and things like that.

25:54.303 --> 25:55.624
The boll weevil certainly was. The many insects 
and things we had, cotton, leafworm, and things

25:55.664 --> 25:59.869
like that. You have all those things. Well, how did 
y'all, what did y'all use to control the boll

26:01.691 --> 26:04.594
weevil? Do you have, can you remember? They used 
poison, kind of a poison. And the hardest thing in

26:08.458 --> 26:13.223
the world to kill, you put one between two blocks of 
ice and it wouldn't kill you. My gosh. Well, what

26:16.486 --> 26:19.309
kind of poison was it, do you know? I don't know what 
the name they used. Poison.

26:26.855 --> 26:46.281
OK,

26:26.855 --> 26:46.281
for the continuation of this tape, please turn it 
over.
