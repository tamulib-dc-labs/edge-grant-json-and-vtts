WEBVTT

00:03.524 --> 00:08.612
committed to the values of A&M, including 
traditions. By that, I mean sometimes shedding a

00:09.754 --> 00:14.641
few tears.

00:18.547 --> 00:26.680
Not treating it just as a academic thing, but a very 
emotional, because Aggies feel emotional about

00:18.547 --> 00:26.680
this group. It's not just the wise decisions and 
just an academic framework.

00:37.717 --> 00:45.715
I will always love George W. Bush for the tears he 
shed when he said goodbye to the state legislature

00:37.717 --> 00:45.715
and said, a job that would cause him to leave Texas. 
I will esteem him highly because I love my state

00:50.670 --> 00:54.135
too. I love the University of Texas. I just see them 
as two sides of the same apple.

01:05.133 --> 01:08.137
I value loyalty and commitment. It bothers me when 
I begin to perceive that they're using people and

01:16.778 --> 01:23.584
using traditions and using things rather than 
having them being part of their very being.

01:29.550 --> 01:43.663
I would want them, I'm very concerned about

01:29.550 --> 01:43.663
bringing in people who are antithetical That's 
what A&M stands for. And I believe there are a lot of

01:45.704 --> 01:48.348
them in the campus. And generally speaking, 
they're in my area in the liberal arts and in the

01:48.368 --> 01:57.945
social studies. I hate to call them social 
sciences. I don't think there is any science or

02:00.129 --> 02:02.513
society. It's an art, not a science.

02:10.677 --> 02:16.348
I've only one time been up in the coffee lounge over 
there. I think one time I was told I really wasn't

02:17.229 --> 02:22.940
wanted there by somebody who just didn't know who I 
was. But Dr. Kramer has invited me to come over

02:23.521 --> 02:25.986
there. Coffee Lounge, where? Coffee Lounge in the 
History Building. Oh. See, I've been back four and

02:31.831 --> 02:34.114
a half years. I was here 21 years as a member of that 
department. I've been invited to only two events

02:37.119 --> 02:41.606
in four and a half years back. They know I'm here 
kind of. I call those people missionaries. that

02:48.578 --> 02:52.923
they think they're doing these peasants a favor 
just by being here. And then after doing some

02:53.484 --> 03:02.995
missionary work here, they will return to the 
civilized world from where they came and leave us

02:53.484 --> 03:02.995
backward savages alone. I

03:04.196 --> 03:16.510
know and I admire many in the athletic department, 
because I think they've done a good job on the

03:04.196 --> 03:16.510
girls' side, because I know that Girl sports are 
rife with lesbianism. Just as I know music

03:20.581 --> 03:28.491
departments are rife with homosexuality, male 
homosexuality.

03:32.707 --> 03:39.156
And I'm sure it will expand to a graduate degree, 
just as soon as the night follows day, that they'll

03:32.707 --> 03:39.156
push for that. But I'm afraid what it's going to do 
in the tone of the university.

03:45.624 --> 03:50.251
I guess I'm a troglodyte or something like that, in 
that many ways. But I'm an informed troglodyte, or

03:50.311 --> 03:53.976
whatever you call it. I'm a dinosaur. But I'm 
willing to change. I'm willing to evolve. But I

03:59.423 --> 04:02.427
don't want to do it too rapidly. If you could make a 
major gift to A&M, if you had the capability to give

04:03.166 --> 04:23.025
a million dollars plus, somebody walks up and 
gives you a check and you've got to pass it on, but

04:03.166 --> 04:23.025
you determine the use of that money, for what 
purpose would you want A&M to use your gift?

04:27.929 --> 04:29.231
It depends on how big it is. Let's say it's a million 
dollars plus. Let me say I had the ability to say

04:32.309 --> 04:49.735
that 2,000

04:32.309 --> 04:49.735
young people could go to Texas A&M tuition free, 
room and board paid, as long as they were in the

04:32.309 --> 04:49.735
Corps of Cadets. I would do it. The Corps of Cadets 
could do the same thing that the military academy

04:53.280 --> 04:56.424
could do. How would you select the 2,000 to receive 
that? pretty much like the service academies do,

05:02.448 --> 05:07.315
have to be open girls. Number one, academics. 
Number two, they would have to have bluttered in

05:11.701 --> 05:30.767
some sport, I don't know how far it extends this, or 
some extracurricular activity, competitive,

05:11.701 --> 05:30.767
in high school. Number three, they would have to go 
before some kind of a board to have the

05:32.047 --> 05:40.197
interpersonal relationship.

05:42.520 --> 05:46.805
And they have to have a great deal of paperwork 
recommendations. Because I'm giving them a great

05:47.225 --> 05:49.208
deal, a great gift. And I think that would

05:50.029 --> 05:55.135
be one. To what former students, faculty, staff do 
you feel most grateful? To what Aggie-related

06:02.118 --> 06:06.203
people do you feel most grateful? Are there some 
folks that you now look back and realize that they

06:07.464 --> 06:11.448
touched your life? Roland Bing. Who? Roland Bing. 
Roland Bing. I was about to see him after I got my

06:15.293 --> 06:20.358
doctorate, just to tell him what I thought of him. 
No, see, he was the battalion advisor. He's an

06:24.082 --> 06:24.863
Aggie. He was here when they started these student 
publications.

06:33.269 --> 06:39.578
When he started the journalism department while 
he was here, he wasn't a part of it, I don't think.

06:39.839 --> 06:42.162
Particularly agriculture journalism. The first 
time they had journalism here as a major. Are there

06:44.425 --> 06:44.986
others? Yeah. Hill. John Hill? John Hill. In 
history? In history. Why was he special? Made me

06:53.458 --> 06:54.059
think.

06:58.886 --> 07:02.171
I thought he was a good scholar. Mm-hmm. as opposed 
to some of the others. I got very resentful of A&M

07:04.166 --> 07:07.951
when I was in advanced course. I had to write a 
30-page monograph on the subject. And I was

07:11.936 --> 07:22.029
totally unprepared to have to write a scholarly 
paper footnoting bibliography and things. I

07:22.089 --> 07:24.993
never had to do that in my undergraduate work. When 
I got where I was in a position to do that in the small

07:25.013 --> 07:32.082
Christian college, I made sure that every senior 
had to write a senior paper They could use some of

07:32.669 --> 07:36.072
their resources, but they had to know the 
mechanics. Number two, they also had to go through

07:36.773 --> 07:43.640
a senior oral done by professors from other 
schools. And because I learned that a lot of kids

07:44.781 --> 07:51.809
can't learn to talk when asked a question when 
they're in a graduate program. Sure. What

07:53.150 --> 08:02.119
happened after World War I, I knew a fine young man 
from the University of Texas, William and Mary,

07:53.150 --> 08:02.119
who absolutely froze up and

08:04.883 --> 08:13.238
The first person that asked me in my doctorate was, 
when you think of 18th century Virginia, what do

08:04.883 --> 08:13.238
you think of? You can take anywhere and run 
anywhere you want to. Just start. Don't say, well,

08:18.186 --> 08:20.871
I don't know. You start. So I just wanted them to 
learn that in an unthreatening environment. And

08:26.301 --> 08:27.583
so those are the things I did. the closest to that. 
The others were not. Are there other people to whom

08:33.200 --> 08:35.482
you feel grateful?

08:39.266 --> 08:41.768
Colonel Olsen, a wonderful man. Now let's see, 
what was his task? He was the senior branch

08:43.790 --> 08:48.294
instructor in infantry last year. Remember his 
first name or initials? O-L-S-E-N? S-O-N. S-O-N,

08:53.539 --> 08:55.041
okay. I don't know his first name. First name was 
Colonel. What did he teach you? What did you learn

09:02.780 --> 09:03.821
from him?

09:06.664 --> 09:21.700
Leadership, love your troops, care, 
understanding,

09:06.664 --> 09:21.700
defend those that you think need defending. I mean 
like giving us advice, imparting wisdom I would

09:22.181 --> 09:29.869
say is the greatest thing that he did. But beyond 
and outside of ROTC, I think he was part of the

09:30.575 --> 09:37.885
wisdom push. The two people in ROTC are the ones 
that you're seeing. John Cook was killed in Korea,

09:41.169 --> 09:46.816
from Carrizo Springs in Aggie. He was somebody I 
greatly admired and respected.

09:57.250 --> 10:00.514
Colonel Handy.

10:03.228 --> 10:05.291
making the most out of what he had. Humble,

10:05.311 --> 10:11.239
strong but humble. Saw Colonel Andy go digging out 
weeds, personally at the track, center track

10:12.120 --> 10:18.268
around Kyle Field. He had to do all of that, and yet 
he was a wonderful coach, had a world-class track

10:19.249 --> 10:28.982
team.

10:33.434 --> 10:35.957
this one and sent it into the Texas Aggie magazine. 
The most inspiring moment in sports occurred here

10:35.977 --> 10:46.271
when Jerry Bonin, the son of a faculty member, 
crawled across the finish line of the Southwest

10:35.977 --> 10:46.271
Conference trying to beat. That's the most 
inspiring thing that I've seen anywhere in

10:46.291 --> 10:49.014
sports. It didn't make world news, national news. 
The man just struggled for more than a quarter of a

10:52.639 --> 11:02.952
lap to get across the finish line.

11:04.467 --> 11:05.429
That's a good question. Okay. All right, I've got 
only one other question. Is there any important

11:09.298 --> 11:14.330
item we've left out that you have thought of? 
Anything we haven't touched on?

11:21.983 --> 11:23.724
Not that I know of. It'll probably come to me. Well, 
and then when we edit it, you can come to it. All

11:28.789 --> 11:35.254
right, then the last question is, what feelings do 
you carry in your heart for Texas A&M today?

11:38.997 --> 11:42.941
It's complicated, as most things are. I'm a 
classical agent.

11:47.404 --> 11:51.568
I value tremendously the memories and the 
fellowships

11:56.071 --> 12:03.882
I hate, I don't want A&M and I fear that it's turning 
into just another state university. We call

12:05.725 --> 12:09.410
ourselves Sing Sing on the brasses. Now the word is 
fear that it's trying to turn into Berklee on the

12:10.431 --> 12:16.099
brasses.

12:16.901 --> 12:25.673
I'd rather be Sing Sing on the brasses with all of 
the discomfort and everything else than to be

12:16.901 --> 12:25.673
Berklee on the brasses. But I love the school. I 
love it because my grandfather loved it. My father

12:30.390 --> 12:31.172
loved it. My mother loved it. My brothers were 
here. I

12:33.235 --> 12:39.243
moved back here from Tennessee. We had a lovely 
home over on the hill looking down the thing. And it

12:41.747 --> 12:43.850
was a great move. My wife says it's the best thing 
we've ever done, to move back here. We have great

12:48.377 --> 12:50.019
ministry for the Lord here. So it's just 
wonderful. being back here and so many things to

12:53.345 --> 12:59.371
do, some of which would not be here if they had him 
that I admire.

13:02.835 --> 13:08.160
The George Bush Library, went to hear the play 
club. One that great? Yeah, went to Ambrose and

13:09.341 --> 13:18.070
Hick when he came here with that group and that 
thing and though How

13:18.674 --> 13:22.679
did he do that? How did that happen? He has people do 
research for him. Yeah, yeah. And also the good

13:30.189 --> 13:34.856
ones, they get embarrassed.

13:37.720 --> 13:43.247
Can you summarize that feeling in a sentence or a 
closing?

13:49.150 --> 13:51.314
It's been memories through my life. And I've 
always strove to build good memories. And I just

13:57.247 --> 14:01.215
have the most wonderful memories about A&M. 
That's great.
