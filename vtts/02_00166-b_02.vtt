WEBVTT

00:03.102 --> 00:08.050
We often wondered why we got in the RVs and he didn't.

00:08.070 --> 00:08.871
We never did know.

00:09.512 --> 00:11.956
And we didn't know even then how you got in.

00:11.996 --> 00:15.802
How did you know you had been selected?

00:18.847 --> 00:23.555
One of the baseball players came with a baseball bat and announced that I was an RV.

00:23.995 --> 00:27.000
And he hit me with a baseball bat across my rear end.

00:27.217 --> 00:31.403
Lefty Matthews was his name.

00:32.044 --> 00:34.127
And you became an RV as a junior?

00:35.149 --> 00:36.170
Yes, yes.

00:36.911 --> 00:38.974
And what did... Well, now, wait a minute.

00:43.261 --> 00:45.163
I get confused on account of that fifth year.

00:45.203 --> 00:50.932
I was in the RVs two years, so I guess it must have been my senior year, then it carried over to my fifth year.

00:51.232 --> 00:53.856
And what were the RV's functions?

00:53.936 --> 00:55.198
Where did y'all go?

00:56.832 --> 01:01.341
We didn't make very many trips.

01:01.945 --> 01:08.151
that I can recall, as a matter of fact, I don't recall we made any like going to Waco to a place like that.

01:08.551 --> 01:19.602
Of course, I was in the band, and where we went something like that, I would usually go with the band rather than the RVs, but most of ours was things that happened there on the campus.

01:19.622 --> 01:23.566
You did not go to the governor's inaugural then, the way they do now?

01:23.646 --> 01:25.247
No, I don't think so.

01:25.328 --> 01:30.012
Well, I know we didn't, and I don't recall that the band went to the inaugural either.

01:29.992 --> 01:34.397
And you wore that white outfit with the high neck, the white uniform?

01:34.697 --> 01:40.704
Yes, yes.

01:43.827 --> 01:47.491
I don't know now if we ever wore a white uniform or not, to tell you the truth of it.

01:48.212 --> 01:49.173
Well, we must have.

01:51.035 --> 01:55.780
On a football weekend, was there a Yale practice on Friday night?

01:56.232 --> 01:57.738
Oh yes, yeah.

01:57.758 --> 01:58.581
Where was it held?

01:58.882 --> 02:00.588
Front of the Y, on the Y steps.

02:02.014 --> 02:03.238
And everybody turned out?

02:04.619 --> 02:06.001
And you had a good time?

02:06.101 --> 02:10.949
Well, maybe some of the seniors didn't, but you can bet the freshmen were all there.

02:11.911 --> 02:19.643
And then you all went to the football game, and you seniors had a good time.

02:20.545 --> 02:24.932
If the Aggies won, did you throw a yell eater into... Not at that time.

02:25.172 --> 02:25.934
Oh, didn't do that?

02:26.074 --> 02:27.977
I don't know when that started.

02:29.172 --> 02:47.721
let's see coach Bible describe him as far as you recall well I remember looking back I thought he was a very good coach I think everybody liked him he won a lot of football games and

02:48.292 --> 02:51.962
We hated to see him leave, particularly go to Texas.

02:52.263 --> 02:53.527
Well, he went to Nebraska first.

02:53.547 --> 02:55.011
Went to Nebraska first, yes.

02:55.693 --> 02:58.862
And Coach Anderson, did you know him at all?

02:59.263 --> 03:00.125
I knew him.

03:00.526 --> 03:02.993
I didn't know him personally, but I knew him there.

03:03.395 --> 03:08.181
track coach, as well as helping, I guess, help Bible and football.

03:08.201 --> 03:08.501
Right.

03:09.242 --> 03:17.732
And let's see, mention Mr. Cashin and Red and Jim Cashin, they come later, his sons.

03:17.892 --> 03:19.514
Yes, they came later.

03:21.696 --> 03:28.644
Let's see, were there some famous visitors that came to the campus that you recall?

03:29.485 --> 03:30.887
You said Paul Whiteman.

03:33.247 --> 03:39.637
Paul Whiteman's the primarily one that I remember, but... Did the governor come over?

03:39.738 --> 03:43.925
Did Ma and Paul Ferguson ever come over?

03:45.567 --> 03:48.492
I don't recall that any of them ever did.

03:48.592 --> 03:52.839
I can't remember doing anything in particular with someone like that being there.

03:55.143 --> 03:59.490
The only one that I can think about was the time we went to Houston for Marshall Foch.

04:00.247 --> 04:27.233
uh let's see did students have nicknames in those days oh yes what was yours i had two pat and irishman well most of them was pat irishman irishman somebody one of the guys picked that up but primarily was pat uh and uh did y'all whip out then no not like they do today yeah

04:29.204 --> 04:32.669
Did you have to learn the names of everybody in your outfit?

04:32.730 --> 04:37.757
I guess we did have a whip out, but it's, I don't know what we called it now.

04:39.540 --> 04:50.858
We had to learn the names of the sophomores, particularly the ones whose room you cleaned up, and somebody, of course, always trying to get you to

04:51.563 --> 04:57.331
to call somebody a different name so they could paddle you.

04:59.094 --> 05:03.180
Let's see, and y'all drilled, where did y'all drill?

05:05.042 --> 05:06.945
Primarily on the drill field.

05:07.305 --> 05:09.268
The same one that's there today.

05:12.793 --> 05:14.095
I was trying to think

05:15.695 --> 05:22.305
Well, I guess the other thing, when we had machine gun practice or something like that, we went back over all the railroad tracks someplace with some of that.

05:22.926 --> 05:24.669
But most of it was right there on the drill field.

05:25.250 --> 05:27.633
And the cavalry, where did they keep their horses?

05:30.037 --> 05:31.039
Back in the horse barn?

05:31.159 --> 05:33.102
Back in the horse barn, but I don't remember.

05:33.883 --> 05:39.812
Well, it must have been back there close to where the...

05:40.417 --> 05:42.460
Coliseum was, or whatever they called the place.

05:42.481 --> 05:42.881
The pavilion?

05:43.222 --> 05:44.464
I can't—the pavilion, yeah.

05:44.825 --> 05:47.489
I don't remember that they were over across the railroad track at all.

05:47.509 --> 05:49.072
Most of them—well, now wait a minute.

05:52.417 --> 05:53.059
Cavalry.

05:53.079 --> 05:59.710
I was thinking—I'm trying to get—I'm getting the Parson Cavalry confused with the regular Army Cavalry.

06:00.091 --> 06:02.695
I guess they kept back over around the pavilion.

06:02.962 --> 06:09.289
Because when y'all had a real review, did the cavalry units come by on horses in the 20s?

06:09.650 --> 06:15.777
Yes, and the artillery had their guns pulled by the horses, too.

06:15.797 --> 06:19.120
Was there even an outfit called the Army Air Corps?

06:19.181 --> 06:19.441
Yes.

06:20.482 --> 06:21.023
Oh, really?

06:21.183 --> 06:21.543
Yes.

06:21.563 --> 06:23.546
Nutz Weiland, O.P.

06:23.566 --> 06:27.410
Weiland, was a junior my freshman year.

06:28.711 --> 06:31.855
And, well, I guess you know the rest of the story about him.

06:32.560 --> 06:41.740
Well, it's my understanding that he was in command of the Air Forces that were furnishing the cover for the people landing on Normandy.

06:42.261 --> 06:42.382
Oh.

06:43.143 --> 06:47.633
And in the Memorial Student Center building, there's one of those

06:47.883 --> 06:49.766
things hanging in there, O.P.

06:49.826 --> 06:50.487
Weiland.

06:50.507 --> 06:51.488
Oh, okay.

06:51.729 --> 07:00.101
In school, we knew him as Nuts, Nuts Weiland, but everybody else in the Army, I understand, called him Opie.

07:01.604 --> 07:06.211
Let's see, describe, where'd you get your boots?

07:07.653 --> 07:10.056
I got mine secondhand from a student.

07:10.597 --> 07:11.038
How much?

07:12.840 --> 07:13.421
$20, $25.

07:14.122 --> 07:15.865
I understand that at that time,

07:17.043 --> 07:18.845
Everybody wanted Lou Casey boots.

07:19.866 --> 07:22.109
That was the main boot seller.

07:22.329 --> 07:28.957
And I don't remember whether they had to go to San Antonio to get them or whether somebody there on the campus furnished them.

07:29.477 --> 07:34.883
But I bought mine from some senior that was graduating and his boots fit me.

07:36.746 --> 07:38.708
Was Hollicks even in existence then?

07:38.828 --> 07:39.088
Yes.

07:39.909 --> 07:40.770
They were there.

07:41.891 --> 07:44.054
I think a lot of them bought their boots at Hollicks.

07:45.355 --> 07:46.797
How did you feel that

07:47.114 --> 07:50.740
junior year when you put those boots on for the first time?

07:51.201 --> 07:52.503
Well, I thought, man alive.

07:53.885 --> 07:54.626
Got it made.

07:55.889 --> 07:59.735
And your Aggie ring, do you remember what it cost?

08:01.398 --> 08:05.885
I think around $25, but incidentally I lost my original one in 1983.

08:06.306 --> 08:09.311
I got a new one and that one cost me right around $300.

08:09.331 --> 08:13.037
$280, I think it was.

08:13.372 --> 08:18.299
Do you have any ring stories before you lost that, or do you have any other stories?

08:19.461 --> 08:28.274
Well, in those days, the juniors had what they called a junior pin, which was a spread eagle kind of a pin.

08:29.036 --> 08:33.642
And those days, everybody had a long watch fob, a wide watch fob.

08:34.143 --> 08:36.687
And I had my junior pin on that watch fob.

08:36.707 --> 08:41.995
And then later on, when I got in the RVs, I took that,

08:42.464 --> 08:46.510
junior pin and the RV pin I had a little chain put in between the two.

08:46.550 --> 09:07.941
And I guess I wore that and then after I graduated all I put it in a little jewelry box and my daughter had it up until a few years ago and had it in a safe in their home and they got robbed and they took the safe out.

09:08.201 --> 09:12.167
It was a small one but weighed two or three hundred pounds but they were able to get it out.

09:12.670 --> 09:17.216
And lost that thing along with some other memorabilia that I wished I had today.

09:17.256 --> 09:22.382
But I really liked that little junior pin and the RV pin chained together again.

09:22.422 --> 09:23.824
It was a really nice little outfit.

09:24.505 --> 09:26.728
What does an Aggie ring really signify?

09:30.693 --> 09:38.222
Well, I feel like that wherever you go and you see that ring, you've got a friend.

09:39.822 --> 09:57.348
I remember one night in Chicago, I was at the airport there going somewhere, and over ten or twelve feet from me was a fellow sitting over there, and I was sure that he had an Aggie ring on, but I didn't go over and introduce myself to him.

09:57.388 --> 10:09.205
But I just feel that now you've got a friend wherever you might go and approach him properly and be able to do most anything for you.

10:10.805 --> 10:13.530
Now, what is it that builds this Aggie spirit?

10:16.115 --> 10:33.005
Well, as far as I was concerned, when you're in that Aggie band for, like I was, five years, and you march that Cadet Corps into the Miss Hall twice a day for five years, that really gets the Aggie spirit into you.

10:33.025 --> 10:35.209
And when you're a drum major your fifth year,

10:35.797 --> 10:37.218
That really does it for you.

10:37.479 --> 10:38.360
Were you a drum major?

10:38.500 --> 10:38.840
Oh, yes.

10:38.960 --> 10:40.802
I'm the oldest living drum major today.

10:41.202 --> 10:43.925
Describe what being a drum major included.

10:44.145 --> 10:45.827
What were the duties of the drum major?

10:46.928 --> 10:51.793
Well, all I had to do was to get out in front of the band when we go to march and head them out.

10:52.974 --> 10:54.035
Lead them off.

10:54.195 --> 10:58.139
Well, of course, the band director actually kept the time and set the cadence for us.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.784
But that was about all I had to do was just lead the band.

11:03.024 --> 11:04.105
Did you inspect them?

11:04.546 --> 11:04.926
No.

11:05.294 --> 11:07.860
No, that was up to the captain to do that.

11:08.000 --> 11:12.971
No, I guess all I had to do was just lead the band down the street.

11:13.312 --> 11:17.121
Now, your uniform was what, as the band?

11:17.361 --> 11:19.827
Just a regular cadet uniform.

11:19.925 --> 11:20.646
Senior boots?

11:21.247 --> 11:22.649
Senior boots, uh-huh.

11:22.669 --> 11:24.491
And what kind of baton did you use?

11:24.732 --> 11:30.460
It's over, well, it's just like the one that's in the building now, the Cadet Corps building now.

11:30.640 --> 11:31.361
Big, long one?

11:31.541 --> 11:32.463
Big, long one, uh-huh.

11:32.483 --> 11:35.807
And incidentally, my saxophone is in there that I played in the band with.

11:36.668 --> 11:38.972
And what cadence did you all march to then?

11:39.432 --> 11:42.777
I think it was around 80 beats per minute.

11:43.010 --> 11:44.652
Oh, so a little slower than today.

11:44.892 --> 11:45.473
It may be.

11:45.733 --> 11:46.654
Because now it's 90.

11:46.895 --> 11:47.295
Oh, is it?

11:47.696 --> 11:52.061
I often wonder, but I think 80 was the ones that we had set.

11:53.202 --> 12:00.230
And they also do six to five, six strides for five yards for the football.

12:00.771 --> 12:04.556
I don't recall that we measured it at that time.

12:04.576 --> 12:08.600
Incidentally, I marched with a band in that 100th reunion.

12:09.141 --> 12:10.823
Darn near killed me, but I did it.

12:11.495 --> 12:26.634
But I told them, although I was, like I say, the oldest drum major, I wanted to march with the band, but I didn't want to get out there in front, because we didn't do all those fancy things, and I didn't want to mess the deal.

12:27.536 --> 12:35.646
But I had a little difficulty in making those turns with them, but I didn't mess up the band, but I could have very easily.

12:36.537 --> 13:01.110
in those times when you were the drum major did you ever have you remember any goof ups any missteps that the band had no i can remember we for one of the games down in houston i had to stop the band because the crowd was just coming in on the street and we couldn't get through without just elbow to elbow coming

13:01.563 --> 13:06.147
So we stopped the band until the police on the motorcycles cleared out the band.

13:06.788 --> 13:08.990
I mean, they cleared out the street and let us through.

13:09.050 --> 13:13.834
But I don't recall of any unfortunate situations anywhere that we ever had.

13:14.115 --> 13:16.937
All right, was that the march down Main Street?

13:17.117 --> 13:19.720
Down Main Street, somewhere near the Rice Hotel.

13:20.420 --> 13:27.187
Now, what was the easiest place for a muster, I mean, a court trip march?

13:28.928 --> 13:30.810
Where was the best place?

13:31.786 --> 13:33.369
They were all about the same.

13:33.429 --> 13:35.292
We had no problems anywhere.

13:35.332 --> 13:41.263
I can't think of any place.

13:41.364 --> 13:53.085
Usually we'd go down to Main Street until we got to the reviewing stand and then make either a right or left turn and do a countermarch and come back and face the reviewing stand as the Cadet Corps marched by.

13:53.369 --> 13:57.675
What team did the Aggies most want to beat in those years?

13:58.857 --> 14:01.280
Same as today, University of Texas.

14:01.300 --> 14:03.143
And what did y'all call it then?

14:03.203 --> 14:04.705
Did y'all call it TU then?

14:04.765 --> 14:07.990
Yeah, just TU.

14:08.090 --> 14:12.576
I don't think we used the little t and the little u today like they do.

14:12.957 --> 14:13.398
Okay.

14:13.538 --> 14:14.679
We just called it TU.

14:14.699 --> 14:15.501
All right.

14:15.781 --> 14:21.469
After Texas, was there anybody else that was next in the pecking order that you wanted to beat?

14:23.440 --> 14:25.162
I can't remember that there was.

14:25.903 --> 14:28.386
Or the rest of them.

14:28.406 --> 14:33.052
We consider the rest of them more as just little schools.

14:33.933 --> 14:36.977
Let's see, did you all take any long trip with the band?

14:39.641 --> 14:39.841
No.

14:40.101 --> 14:43.305
You didn't go up to Kentucky to play?

14:43.766 --> 14:46.009
No, furthest from College Station was Dallas.

14:47.030 --> 14:48.672
Dallas or Fort Worth.

14:49.090 --> 14:54.956
But let's see, were you there at the 12th man game in Dallas?

14:55.036 --> 14:55.316
No.

14:55.797 --> 15:00.361
No, I couldn't afford it, I guess, and I didn't go.

15:01.042 --> 15:01.483
Okay.

15:02.203 --> 15:15.857
All right, as you are preparing to leave the campus when you're going to graduate, how well prepared did you feel A&M had made you for the real world?

15:18.790 --> 15:25.957
Well, I think I felt like I had a pretty good education and was able to hold down a job.

15:26.017 --> 15:34.005
I guess one good feeling, or let me have a good feeling, was the fact that I already had a job before I graduated.

15:34.746 --> 15:38.029
When they gave you that offer, did they give you something in writing?

15:38.290 --> 15:39.671
No, not at that time.

15:39.791 --> 15:47.599
I got a letter a little later on telling me that I had been accepted and reported to the General Electric Company and connected to New York on July the

15:48.676 --> 15:50.157
8th, I think it was, 1926.

15:51.359 --> 15:53.100
Did they offer to pay your way up there?

15:53.241 --> 15:53.601
No, sir.

15:56.063 --> 15:57.905
Come up there and work for 50 cents an hour.

15:58.025 --> 15:59.787
And they didn't give you any signing bonus?

16:00.047 --> 16:03.631
No, indeed.

16:03.671 --> 16:07.995
Did the job turn out to be what they said it was going to be?

16:08.716 --> 16:09.837
Yes, yes.

16:10.157 --> 16:15.442
I always wanted to get back into the sales department.

16:16.443 --> 16:18.025
That was the idea I had because

16:18.224 --> 16:27.654
I knew some people with General Electricity in Dallas, and I thought I'd like to get back into Dallas.

16:27.674 --> 16:35.562
And I let it be known when I went up to Schenectady that eventually I wanted to get back in Dallas or somewhere close by.

16:35.622 --> 16:41.729
And after I'd been up there fourteen months, there was this opening that came to Tulsa.

16:41.749 --> 16:46.594
Well, actually there was a man there that they had had only about a year who was incidentally

16:46.962 --> 17:03.115
graduate A&M, but something went wrong anyhow and they let him go and they had to have somebody in a hurry and although I wanted to stay in Schenectady about another year and a half, get a little more experience.

17:03.753 --> 17:06.817
But anyhow, that talked me into going on down to Tulsa and I did.

17:07.017 --> 17:10.461
And so I went down there after about 14 months training in Schenectady.

17:11.583 --> 17:18.652
All right, back to your, do you remember the final review with the Corps before graduation?

17:19.032 --> 17:19.312
Uh-huh.

17:19.853 --> 17:22.376
Did anybody from your family come up for that?

17:22.576 --> 17:23.498
My mother was there.

17:24.038 --> 17:25.881
She was there at the final review.

17:25.901 --> 17:28.123
Describe it as well as you remember.

17:29.846 --> 17:32.629
How big was the crowd and what happened?

17:40.220 --> 17:52.315
Well, there was a big crowd there, but I guess I was so excited and worried about leading the band out there in review that I wasn't paying too much attention to what was going on.

17:52.435 --> 17:57.761
But it was something you'll never forget in all your life, was that final review.

17:57.781 --> 18:00.224
All right, and so you led the band.

18:00.725 --> 18:01.085
Uh-huh.

18:01.105 --> 18:08.995
Then you go over to the side and watch the new band come through, yeah, with a new...

18:09.430 --> 18:26.026
new band drum major, but I can't remember the band going through twice like that.

18:26.086 --> 18:29.413
I think we played for the whole thing without changing.

18:29.900 --> 18:38.936
I know that Jack Pink became the drum major after I, well, I'm sure they didn't because they weren't appointed until that fall.

18:39.598 --> 18:42.182
So same band, I did the whole thing.

18:42.222 --> 18:43.905
Okay, all right.

18:43.925 --> 18:46.791
Then commencement, where was commencement held?

18:46.831 --> 18:47.772
It was in Guyon Hall.

18:47.793 --> 18:48.313
In Guyon?

18:48.854 --> 18:48.995
Uh-huh.

18:49.015 --> 18:53.022
Do you remember, describe what commencement was like?

18:53.508 --> 19:08.689
Well, there again, of course, all the graduates were formed in Guyon Hall, and those that wanted to, plus their parents, they were all there, and the student body that wanted to come in and watch the proceedings were there.

19:09.170 --> 19:18.503
The hall was pretty well filled up, and as the names were called each individual, they walked across the podium and got their

19:18.483 --> 19:23.770
diploma and went back to their seat and the weight of it was all over again.

19:24.111 --> 19:26.234
Was Dr. Bezell still the president?

19:26.254 --> 19:27.295
He was there, yes.

19:27.315 --> 19:28.156
And shook hands?

19:28.857 --> 19:29.157
Yes.

19:29.898 --> 19:31.681
Was your diploma rolled up?

19:31.701 --> 19:32.482
Rolled up, yes.

19:32.562 --> 19:33.063
Okay.

19:33.443 --> 19:34.645
So just like today?

19:34.745 --> 19:36.147
Just like today, yeah.

19:36.167 --> 19:37.669
Was it done seriously?

19:37.809 --> 19:39.872
Did anybody try to do any pranks?

19:40.072 --> 19:41.554
No, it was a very serious matter.

19:42.135 --> 19:44.338
Was there a baccalaureate event then?

19:44.993 --> 19:45.834
A baccalaureate?

19:45.894 --> 19:47.517
I don't recall that there was.

19:48.498 --> 19:49.419
I've never heard of one.

19:50.441 --> 19:51.623
I don't recall there was.

19:55.028 --> 19:55.849
I'm about finished.

19:55.869 --> 19:56.810
What have we left out?

19:57.231 --> 19:59.775
Can you think of some subjects we should have touched on?

20:01.437 --> 20:04.081
I mentioned about the firecracker in the piano.

20:04.101 --> 20:05.483
Oh, yes sir.

20:06.155 --> 20:08.337
I don't think I'll ever forget that for some reason.

20:08.357 --> 20:09.238
I agree.

20:10.959 --> 20:13.661
Then I mentioned about the offer of going to London.

20:13.681 --> 20:14.462
Yes, sir.

20:14.742 --> 20:15.363
Rodeo.

20:16.064 --> 20:21.648
You remember any other than the young man who died in the train, you remember any other sad events?

20:24.471 --> 20:28.194
Well, I don't know whether it was Soupy Woods.

20:28.694 --> 20:32.197
He used to play the bugle in the mornings to wake up.

20:32.217 --> 20:35.200
And I don't remember whether it was during his regime

20:35.956 --> 20:40.023
when Reveille got its name or not.

20:41.164 --> 20:47.795
But they had that horn that was the man to blow in down there close to Sullivan's statue.

20:48.997 --> 20:52.343
And Soupy Woods was the bugler at that time.

20:52.403 --> 21:02.419
And I don't know when, like I say, whether or not it was at that time that the dog got the name of Reveille or not, but I think it came through later on.

21:02.703 --> 21:06.636
Was the statue of Sully where it is now?

21:06.756 --> 21:07.679
Yes, same place.

21:08.482 --> 21:09.987
Were you all expected to polish it?

21:11.050 --> 21:11.953
Some of them were.

21:11.973 --> 21:13.959
I don't think anybody from the band ever had to do it.

21:13.980 --> 21:16.307
We had a few privileges being in the band.

21:16.692 --> 21:24.422
Oh, Mr. Rudder told me that when he was a student in the 30s, there was a light up on top of the academic building.

21:24.602 --> 21:25.383
Prixie's Moon.

21:25.984 --> 21:27.586
And it was good to shoot at it.

21:27.927 --> 21:28.568
Oh, yeah.

21:28.588 --> 21:30.510
Every once in a while somebody would shoot it out.

21:30.530 --> 21:31.091
Is that right?

21:31.411 --> 21:31.852
Yeah.

21:31.872 --> 21:35.937
Were there ever any holes in the roof from where they... I don't know that there were.

21:36.258 --> 21:38.841
I heard that there were, but I don't know that there were.

21:38.861 --> 21:40.303
I never did see any, at least.

21:40.520 --> 21:45.408
Did people refer to Dr. Bezell as Prexy?

21:45.769 --> 21:46.370
Yes.

21:46.390 --> 21:47.892
He was the Prexy.

21:48.433 --> 21:49.275
Prexy Bezell.

21:50.076 --> 21:55.986
When Mr. Rudder called himself the Prexy, we didn't know what he was talking about at first.

21:56.347 --> 21:57.709
That was a new term to us.

21:58.771 --> 22:00.013
A new term to us.

22:00.432 --> 22:08.842
And let's see, we mentioned bonfire and you didn't remember bonfire and you didn't remember a muster and silver taps.

22:10.204 --> 22:12.967
But yes, yell practice.

22:12.987 --> 22:21.478
And let's see, any other jokes or Aggie good bull that you remember?

22:21.578 --> 22:22.039
Pranks?

22:26.024 --> 22:28.887
Well, in the shacks,

22:29.710 --> 22:33.656
One of the fellows, Shaq, caught on fire.

22:35.359 --> 22:40.407
And Percy Zimmerman, a good friend of mine, and Arthur Elliott lived together.

22:40.447 --> 22:42.430
Arthur still lives in Corpus Christi.

22:43.431 --> 22:46.977
But I don't know whether he was kidding or not, but Percy always

22:48.256 --> 22:50.880
was kidding me about setting his room on fire.

22:52.102 --> 22:56.808
I don't know who did it, and I don't know whether they ever found out or whether it was just an accident, probably.

22:56.848 --> 22:58.611
I don't think anybody set it on fire.

22:59.232 --> 23:03.919
I think they may have spilled some coals out one day building a fire or something like that.

23:04.780 --> 23:15.175
But Percy used to always kid me about being the guy that set fire in his room, but that's certainly an incident that I can recall other than the fried turkey sandwich.

23:16.201 --> 23:28.118
If you could have all of the Aggie faculty staff from that era back here today, which ones would you want most to express your appreciation to?

23:28.459 --> 23:35.809
Who would you most want to thank?

23:35.829 --> 23:40.536
Well the person that I can remember mostly and I had very little to do with was Ike Ashman.

23:42.899 --> 23:43.440
He

23:43.910 --> 23:46.274
stuck in my mind for some reason or another.

23:46.314 --> 23:47.896
He was a commandant at the time.

23:47.916 --> 23:55.067
And all of the professors were about equal as well as I recall.

23:55.087 --> 23:59.995
They were all good, did their job, and what I didn't learn was my fault.

24:03.821 --> 24:11.993
I just had that one unfortunate situation with a calculus professor that, as far as I'm concerned, he just didn't explain anything.

24:12.698 --> 24:16.243
But they were all all right.

24:17.445 --> 24:21.150
Now, y'all didn't calculate your grade point ratio, did you then?

24:21.170 --> 24:22.351
No, we didn't have grade points.

24:22.391 --> 24:23.253
That's what I thought.

24:24.074 --> 24:26.197
You knew what you'd passed and what you'd failed.

24:26.577 --> 24:35.209
I had trigonometry in high school and had to repeat it my freshman year up there at A&M.

24:35.229 --> 24:37.452
And shoot, I walked through that.

24:37.532 --> 24:39.415
And as a matter of fact, I

24:40.593 --> 24:54.717
had pretty good grades my freshman year I guess and maybe for that reason I loafed a little bit my sophomore year and that's when calculus got me.

24:56.300 --> 25:03.833
Make-believe someone walked up to you tomorrow and handed you a check for a million dollars and there was one condition

25:04.437 --> 25:11.048
you had to pass it on to Texas A&M, but you could decide what it would be used to do.

25:11.909 --> 25:17.518
If you were to do something very generous for A&M, what part of A&M would you most want to help?

25:19.281 --> 25:22.906
Well, I think I would divide it between the Cadet Corps and the band.

25:23.487 --> 25:23.768
Okay.

25:24.950 --> 25:30.158
I think the band is one of the

25:32.281 --> 25:35.965
biggest things that brings attention to the university.

25:37.647 --> 25:59.233
It's unfortunate that they don't show more of it on television, but I think wherever they go, the people that are in the stadium are very well impressed with the Aggie band, their character, the way they handle themselves, the things they do, and the presentation they make to the public.

26:00.057 --> 26:02.640
I think it's an attribute to the university.

26:04.623 --> 26:06.685
I agree, I agree.

26:08.408 --> 26:22.926
Somebody mentioned to me recently and the thing was, of course it can't be dumb, but he said, you know it's too bad that the A&M doesn't have a ring for those

26:23.598 --> 26:31.689
who graduated as members of the Cadet Corps to distinguish them between the present graduates.

26:31.709 --> 26:33.191
Well, you can't do it, of course.

26:33.511 --> 26:34.913
It couldn't possibly be done.

26:35.594 --> 26:51.816
But it occurs to me it would be nice to have a ring that distinguish a graduate from the Cadet Corps, as it was in those days, strictly a military school than a big, well-named university to this day.

26:52.387 --> 26:54.891
I don't think it would work at all.

26:54.931 --> 26:58.958
In fact, I know it wouldn't, but it was just something that somebody mentioned recently.

27:02.604 --> 27:04.347
Let's see, getting close to the end.

27:05.550 --> 27:08.034
What are the qualities of being an Aggie?

27:12.301 --> 27:12.842
Well...

27:18.577 --> 27:46.930
I think you want to try to present yourself in a manner that people will appreciate what you're trying to do for them, to help them in selecting equipment, in trying to present your product properly, to show them that you have received an education from an institution that has taught you to

27:47.939 --> 28:04.858
take advantage of what they have tried to give you in the way of education and make a good, take an opportunity of the things that have been given to you to do.

28:07.701 --> 28:08.442
Last question.

28:09.563 --> 28:13.928
What feelings do you carry in your heart for Texas A&M?

28:14.729 --> 28:15.330
I love it.

28:20.592 --> 28:26.765
I just love to come up here.

28:27.587 --> 28:33.861
Like I say, I miss military walk, but I do love to come back up to the college whenever I can.

28:33.901 --> 28:37.649
I want to live 80 miles from here, and I try to come as often as I can.

28:38.912 --> 28:39.613
Let's quit there.
