WEBVTT

00:02.275 --> 00:11.309
The board meetings in those days were held in the 
old... Boardroom. Boardroom. Yeah, which was a

00:12.351 --> 00:18.801
board, a board, yeah, was a wood building. That old 
Victorian house north of Sabeasa. Yeah, it was

00:24.095 --> 00:31.910
near the dining hall there, in that area, yeah, and 
down the, well, you know where it was. In the era

00:31.930 --> 00:45.377
before open meetings, by law, normally who from 
Texas A&M, as in terms of people employed by A&M,

00:31.930 --> 00:45.377
who normally went to the board meetings? Only who 
Mr. Rutter invited and approved, to put it that

00:46.488 --> 00:51.635
simply. He usually invited me to go because he had a 
lot of things he had asked me to develop and he

00:52.717 --> 00:59.286
didn't know thoroughly the background. But I 
would sit in the corner. I wouldn't say a word until

01:01.149 --> 01:05.334
he invited me to say something in the early days. 
And of course there were no reporters there. No

01:07.858 --> 01:11.483
faculty, no students, unless invited. No, the 
only female was usually the secretary taking

01:11.935 --> 01:17.755
notes, recording the minutes. Normally how long 
did board meetings last? The usual pattern was

01:21.723 --> 01:33.987
that they would come in the night before and would 
be housed on campus and usually have a dinner.

01:34.228 --> 01:37.093
Well, often Mr. Rudder would feed some drinking 
place for them off campus, usually the country

01:37.153 --> 01:44.187
club. And they would meet all, start, have 
breakfast early, start very early, in modern

01:44.318 --> 01:54.833
standards, about eight o'clock, definitely on 
their way. And it would go usually all day, and

01:56.135 --> 01:59.100
sometimes it would last two days. But usually it 
was a full day meeting. They would usually get

02:03.286 --> 02:06.651
through late, fairly late at night, 6.30 or so. Now 
in the 60s, the board members came and went by

02:07.211 --> 02:13.060
plane, They weren't coming by train, were they? It 
varied with the person that would drive or be

02:18.589 --> 02:26.881
driven by a chauffeur that would come here, and 
some would come by plane. But as I recall, not too

02:28.082 --> 02:33.090
many, well, until the university got its own 
airplane. They used to fly some of the board

02:33.210 --> 02:34.972
members in. Now that would be taboo, I guess, 
knowing it. Let's see, kind of a trivia question.

02:42.233 --> 02:51.777
Given the state laws at the time, were alcoholic 
beverages ever served on campus for board events

02:42.233 --> 02:51.777
in that era? Not to my knowledge, Haskell. Because 
to my knowledge, it was always off campus. Oh,

02:58.989 --> 02:59.289
yeah. If there was any alcoholic beverage at all. 
In fact, well, I guess you probably know this. We

03:08.182 --> 03:14.130
used to hide where the money came from to buy the 
alcohol, the source of what we were buying,

03:08.182 --> 03:14.130
really. Well, I wouldn't hide it, but the person 
asked to do it would, was not to disclose where the

03:14.110 --> 03:21.581
money came from or what it was for. Right. Now, when 
I became dean of faculties, Buck Wirus called me

03:21.741 --> 03:42.632
over that day and said, here is a $500 account at the 
former student association, and if you need to

03:21.741 --> 03:42.632
spend any money on anything for which you're not 
supposed to spend state money, charge it to this

03:21.741 --> 03:42.632
account. give us a receipt, and never, never, 
never, even if it's a glass of wine, never charge

03:42.882 --> 03:51.459
that to the state account. Charge that to the 
student account. Right. And that happened even

03:53.944 --> 03:57.752
before that, when Dick Hervey was the headed the 
Former Students Association. He used to give Earl

04:02.089 --> 04:07.336
about five times what he would allocate to me, but 
he would allocate a sum to me. And we were told the

04:08.238 --> 04:09.940
same story. And to buy things that we were not 
supposed to use state money for. There were many

04:15.408 --> 04:16.529
things we weren't. Now when the board members came 
for a meeting here, they normally did not bring

04:17.170 --> 04:22.678
their wives?

04:25.382 --> 04:27.705
Not many did, to my knowledge. Because many of them 
stayed right on the campus. And was Mrs. Cashin

04:31.310 --> 04:38.106
still living there, taking care of the house, Red 
Cashin's mother? She was initially, yeah.

04:41.607 --> 04:48.354
because I knew that I've heard many of them say very 
positive things about her thoughtfulness. Yeah.

04:48.754 --> 04:49.174
Let's see. Mr. Rutter, during the 60s, Dr. 
Harrington was the chancellor. And how did things

04:57.823 --> 05:02.508
flow? On what basis did things go from President 
Rutter to Chancellor Harrington? Did all matters

05:10.126 --> 05:14.532
go to the board through the chancellor? Well, 
initially before Earl came to be appointed as

05:16.415 --> 05:27.409
president, first he was appointed academic, I 
mean appointed vice president without

05:16.415 --> 05:27.409
portfolio. And then he was, they all knew he was 
going to be present, so it was announced shortly.

05:32.456 --> 05:38.985
At that time, Dr. Harrington was both chancellor 
and president of A&M College and chancellor of the

05:32.456 --> 05:38.985
system. So after Mr. Rutter came, there was 
initially a little jostling, I guess you'd put it

05:40.535 --> 05:52.232
politely, of who had the call on what. But Mr. 
Rutter initially was more than willing to bend

05:54.187 --> 06:03.482
over backwards to try to get along with Tom and to 
coordinate things for Tom. And they were fairly

06:03.542 --> 06:05.345
compatible. I've seen others, chancellors and 
presidents that weren't, but they were.

06:15.871 --> 06:37.120
Anything about A&M University and later, when 
after Mr. Murutter took over the services, the

06:15.871 --> 06:37.120
Extension Service and Experiment Station and the 
Engineering Extension Service and Experiment

06:15.871 --> 06:37.120
Station and Transportation Institute, he was 
very zealous that he had the input of what was going

06:15.871 --> 06:37.120
to happen in those units. Initially, it was only 
A&M College. But as president, he wanted the

06:41.578 --> 06:47.582
services and the stations to report through the 
president. In fact, he brought that about. That's

06:52.594 --> 06:53.475
what I had heard. Oh, yes. Some of the board 
members, just to be frank, I shouldn't sometimes

06:56.738 --> 07:12.552
be candid as I am, but some of the board members at 
the time thought that Chancellor Tom Harrington

06:56.738 --> 07:12.552
was not active enough or aggressive enough in 
pushing things for A&M. And they more or less

07:13.633 --> 07:19.358
challenged Mr. Rutter to do that and eventually 
gave him the responsibility for doing it. All

07:19.338 --> 07:20.299
right. If you could organize – in this question, I 
give you imperial power. How would you organize

07:27.767 --> 07:34.454
the structure for the stations and the services? 
Where would they report? I think they should be

07:36.496 --> 07:41.121
under the campus university in which they're 
housed. I'm not a strong believer in a strong

07:43.343 --> 07:48.028
system arrangement. In fact, I'm not a strong 
believer in a large system continually taking in

07:50.152 --> 07:56.098
new institutions. It only dilutes the resources. 
I can't imagine today that it helps Texas A&M at all

07:59.222 --> 08:13.497
to have these others except perhaps for Prairie 
View as members of the same organizational unit.

08:14.018 --> 08:15.519
First of all, they're quite different. Most of 
those others are primarily teaching

08:15.860 --> 08:18.943
institutions. But Haskell, in the early days, 
Prairie View thought that they were blood

08:18.923 --> 08:24.589
brothers to A&M. Oh, no, I agree. To mostly the 
agriculture relationships, and they weren't. I

08:29.394 --> 08:29.735
agree. Very close relationships were had. That 
one I understand. Let's see, the Tarleton, I mean,

08:35.361 --> 08:43.429
excuse me, the Arlington giveaway, that occurred 
after you left? Yes. No, no, no. That happens

08:44.754 --> 08:48.494
during Rutter's regime and when I was here. Can you 
review that, please?

08:54.648 --> 09:03.825
Well, I frankly don't know all of the details, but 
there was disagreements between Mr. Rutter and

08:54.648 --> 09:03.825
some of the people there responsible. It wasn't 
Wendell. No, no. It wasn't he, because he and Mr.

09:07.712 --> 09:10.537
Rutter got along well. It was people on the 
different boards, I think, were primarily

09:10.557 --> 09:14.485
fighting. I'm not fully privy of all what 
happened, but all I know is I agreed with Mr. Rudder

09:19.734 --> 09:21.957
that it was a blessing to get rid of Arlington. They 
gave it to the University of Texas. They wanted it.

09:25.662 --> 09:28.446
And we got the Galveston campus about the same 
time. How did that come about, the Galveston?

09:34.215 --> 09:37.800
Well, primarily through the Moody family and 
foundation and strong former students in this

09:38.827 --> 09:46.456
area backing it. And I guess Babe Swartz probably 
helped. Yes. That's one way we got Babe Swartz's

09:50.560 --> 09:57.368
approval on other things by backing what he wanted 
in the Galveston area. And you want to know how it

09:58.530 --> 10:00.712
came about? Well, it was 100 acres donated to start 
with on Pelican Island for it. which one of the

10:05.017 --> 10:13.307
former students, a large multimillionaire 
still, and the Moody family helped put up the

10:05.017 --> 10:13.307
money. Mary Moody, Mary Northern Moody, was a very 
strong proponent of Mr. Rudder. She liked him

10:22.399 --> 10:23.640
immensely. She liked the military. Their dad was a 
military person. And she was difficult to get

10:28.867 --> 10:33.272
along with, but she really liked Mr. Rudder and 
what he was doing. Now, I've heard a 99th-hand

10:35.003 --> 10:51.963
report that one of the old forts, Coast Artillery 
Forts, in the middle of the seawall, that property

10:35.003 --> 10:51.963
was also offered to A&M. Do you remember anything? 
Yeah, I believe so. And I can't recall offhand

10:54.866 --> 11:01.854
exactly the reasons that they didn't follow 
through on it. There was a reason.

11:06.728 --> 11:11.169
You want to know also why Galveston was coveted and 
wanted. Oceanography was being built up very

11:12.154 --> 11:14.967
strong. probably had more impetus than any other 
unit in A&M at the time. And they wanted an outlet to

11:20.394 --> 11:22.657
the sea, naturally. Sure. And that's one reason we 
started with the biological laboratory there,

11:23.999 --> 11:41.219
Marine Biology Laboratory, which became then the 
cadets, I mean the maritime people and all that,

11:23.999 --> 11:41.219
and the actual campus being established. I was on 
the board of visitors when they started. Yeah, I

11:44.123 --> 11:47.046
was there for three years before I left A&M. All 
right. Now, they're going to be celebrating their

11:47.566 --> 11:54.173
50th anniversary very soon because John Calhoun 
mentioned that to me the other day. I don't know

11:54.193 --> 11:58.617
whether it's this fall or not, the creation of the 
oceanography program here. It's hard to realize

11:59.538 --> 12:02.882
it's been going that long.

12:05.864 --> 12:13.472
Yeah.

12:13.452 --> 12:16.457
changes, the modifications were making headway. 
Do you remember any events that where he thought,

12:16.598 --> 12:22.849
okay, we're making progress? Well, Mr. Rutter was 
not a talkative or a euphoric person. He confided

12:27.757 --> 12:32.947
in few people about his feelings about anything. 
But, uh, Sounds like I'm bragging, but I think I was

12:36.976 --> 12:39.580
closer to him. He confided more in me than he did in 
anybody else on the campus, including his own

12:39.620 --> 12:45.529
wife, which I shouldn't say. She would confirm. 
She'd tell you the same thing. You bet. I had a good

12:50.216 --> 12:57.007
interview with her the other day, and she was 
saying that she didn't know much of anything that

12:50.216 --> 12:57.007
happened at the office. Oh, well, her kids will 
tell you they didn't. Mr. Rutter never brought

13:01.193 --> 13:02.796
anything home. We never discussed university 
business. All right, so he shared some things with

13:05.039 --> 13:08.552
you. Who else did he share feelings, 
frustrations, joys with? Do you know? Yeah, in

13:16.413 --> 13:23.487
some things with Tiger Teague, because they were 
pretty close.

13:26.412 --> 13:28.316
They were cut from the same cloth, too. Tiger was 
just as aggressive as Earl Rudder was, and very

13:28.997 --> 13:36.632
capable, and they respected each other. Yeah, and 
Maggie McGee is probably one other that I recall

13:36.612 --> 13:45.031
that he would confide some in. But he knew these 
people would never mention it. was never in any

13:52.188 --> 13:57.276
danger of anything he told Tiger or Maggie. 
They're the two that are outside the university

13:58.117 --> 14:02.965
that I think he probably confided in the most. Do 
you remember any examples of Washington help

14:03.286 --> 14:12.340
where Mr. Teague's role was very, very 
significant? Oh, yeah. There's probably dozens

14:15.538 --> 14:19.326
of examples, Haskell. You can name three or four or 
five of the major buildings on the campus that came

14:20.088 --> 14:32.877
from Tiger Teague's intercession, along with the 
other politicians, of course, LBJ being

14:20.088 --> 14:32.877
president and so forth. I know in the 70s, Mr. 
Teague got a rider on the Veterans Appropriation

14:32.857 --> 14:43.046
Bill to link medical schools with VA hospitals. 
And he was also very helpful in us acquiring what

14:43.326 --> 14:48.991
used to be called Bryan Air Force Base. Oh, I hadn't 
thought of that, yes. Yeah, well, there was a lot of

14:51.673 --> 14:59.060
entanglement that had to be unraveled at the 
federal level, and it wasn't just the state

14:51.673 --> 14:59.060
matters taking it over. It had to be settled at the 
federal level, and Tiger carried that ball. And he

15:02.843 --> 15:08.874
carried the ball on anything Earl Rutter asked him 
to do, he would follow through. Do you remember

15:08.955 --> 15:17.491
anything that Mr. Teague turned down, whether it 
came about or not?

15:23.302 --> 15:26.067
No, I can't write. directly say that. I know, like 
Earl, initially he was opposed to coeducation and

15:27.450 --> 15:37.222
dropping or deemphasizing military. He thought 
we were deemphasizing it.

15:42.208 --> 15:46.533
On the racial integration, I've never heard any 
negative. Do you remember anybody being contrary

15:47.094 --> 15:49.777
to that? To being integrated? No. As surprising as 
it might sound to outsiders, not to you and I,

15:54.514 --> 16:09.183
people were more opposed to coeducation and women 
and dropping the emphasis on military, and they

15:54.514 --> 16:09.183
were on accepting the blacks. In fact, I remember 
board members that I attended in the early days

16:10.883 --> 16:17.673
saying, We've got to bring the blacks in. They're 
the great football players. A&M's going to be

16:19.416 --> 16:20.678
great. And oh, Paul Bear Bryant used to emphasize 
that to Mr. Ruddard. I can remember what Mr.

16:31.113 --> 16:33.837
Ruddard turned to him. He said, Mr. Bryant, girls 
don't play football.

16:40.617 --> 16:45.526
He says, yes, but I'm going to get a lot of good 
players here because they can come here.

16:49.072 --> 16:56.586
I remember hearing Mr. Heaton speak negatively 
about integration, but as I understand it, Mr.

16:57.067 --> 17:01.174
Rudder told Mr. Heaton to review all the 
transcripts. those first armed military

17:01.154 --> 17:22.437
personnel now did is it correct that mr. Rutter 
contacted the Pentagon and said send some black

17:01.154 --> 17:22.437
armed services members when you send this year's 
group to begin summer school include some black He

17:24.290 --> 17:26.355
probably did, knowing Mr. Rudder, but I can't 
vouch for that Haskell, because he handled that

17:26.415 --> 17:30.905
type of matter. He and Dean Hannigan handled most 
of that. I wasn't involved directly in that type of

17:34.453 --> 17:37.861
thing. He knew that I was favored not only 
co-education, but integration, too.

17:48.532 --> 17:51.756
Integration came about much easier than most of 
these other things. Of course, people may not say

17:51.776 --> 17:56.401
that now, but it did. Do you remember any proposals 
that Mr. Rutter came forth that at first you were

17:57.862 --> 18:07.493
hesitant about, but he persuaded you to change 
your mind?

18:11.945 --> 18:18.476
No, I can't, because most of my involvement was in 
the academic research area.

18:20.079 --> 18:26.370
And I cannot honestly say that he ever turned down 
anything that I thought we should be doing in those

18:20.079 --> 18:26.370
areas. In the other areas of leadership and 
administration, It was not his normal tendency to

18:31.739 --> 18:36.267
consult other people about this. He did it, and 
then you were told about it. That's what I

18:38.771 --> 18:39.973
understood. And I'm assuming that on research, he 
didn't claim to be highly knowledgeable. Oh, no,

18:46.705 --> 18:47.587
no. Margaret will tell you this herself, but he 
never made any claim to be even an academic. She

18:54.098 --> 19:01.191
used to say how he used to tell her how fortunate he 
was to get some good academic people to run the

18:54.098 --> 19:01.191
place for him. Because I know we faculty members, 
when he would speak, say, to the arts and sciences

19:01.712 --> 19:14.975
faculty, we never accused him of trying to pose as 
an academic or anything like that. No, you know, he

19:15.015 --> 19:17.760
got an honorary doctorate from Baylor. I remember 
that. Yeah, but he never used it or never insisted

19:18.881 --> 19:22.986
on anybody calling him. I never remember anything 
about Dr. Earl Rudder after that. I used to tell him

19:27.852 --> 19:36.982
kind of in jest, I said, don't make any play out of 
that doctorate, because most doctor degrees

19:27.852 --> 19:36.982
don't mean a pinch of shit. That's right. All 
right. Do you remember any humorous incidents

19:40.766 --> 19:47.494
where something just went wrong, something 
fizzled out, something— Yeah, there's a couple of

19:48.689 --> 19:51.501
anecdotes. I'm going to tell you one. There was a 
former student who was on the faculty He was caught

19:58.544 --> 20:05.294
out on what was then the old Aggie Experiment 
Station building, making out with one of the

19:58.544 --> 20:05.294
secretaries. And he was hauled in to Mr. Rutter for 
chastisement and discipline. And Mr. Rutter, I

20:12.625 --> 20:19.615
wasn't present, but he told me immediately 
afterward, was laughing as much as I'd ever heard

20:12.625 --> 20:19.615
him laugh. He said, I called that guy in, and I said, 
damn it, X. He said, as a former student, I thought

20:25.780 --> 20:38.099
you would have more sense, if you're going to do 
this, to get off the campus. And he says, if I ever

20:38.119 --> 20:42.405
catch you doing it again, I'll kick your ass all the 
way to Austin. What were Mr. Rudder's real

20:46.117 --> 20:50.047
dislikes? Was there something that those of you 
who worked with him closely knew not to do? Well, as

20:56.476 --> 21:05.533
I've said in this account that I wrote up, there was 
two things that I learned early and I was not to

20:56.476 --> 21:05.533
press or to discuss too much with Mr. Reuter. First 
was what he ate or wanted to eat, and second half

21:06.455 --> 21:10.783
what his health was. These were taboo areas as far 
as I was concerned. There were other things too. He

21:21.045 --> 21:22.268
had a good sense of humor. Oh yeah, he had a sense of 
humor. What time did his work day normally begin?

21:28.283 --> 21:29.706
What time did he get to the office? In the early 
days, he would get there quite early, often before

21:30.496 --> 21:42.270
8 o'clock, maybe 7.30, but towards the last of his 
tenure, it slipped more and more. I think it was the

21:42.330 --> 21:44.512
way he was feeling mostly. In the early days, he 
came back after supper? Oh, we never went home

21:48.457 --> 21:50.820
until we got the job done. We stayed there until it 
was 9.30 at night. Oh, in the early days, Dorsey and

21:55.005 --> 21:59.710
I would collect in his office every night as a 
ritual. It wasn't a daytime activity, it was a

22:00.618 --> 22:11.078
nighttime activity, and we would discuss all the 
plans and things that he had encountered during

22:00.618 --> 22:11.078
the day and he wanted solutions to, and on and on. 
Let's see, Dean Hannigan was appointed dean of

22:13.202 --> 22:20.256
students while you were in the administration, 
wasn't he? Yeah.

22:23.855 --> 22:30.786
Oh, I don't recall exactly, but it was in the second 
or third year after I was appointed by Mr. Rutter.

22:30.847 --> 22:33.358
Now, how did Mr. Rutter identify him? He brought 
him in on his own. As you know, he was a former

22:36.447 --> 22:39.851
military officer. Did he know him? He had known 
him. I guess he didn't work with him, but he had

22:42.614 --> 22:48.280
known him through some contacts, and it was highly 
recommended by others. No, I had nothing to do with

22:49.622 --> 22:52.205
bringing Dean Hannigan here. That was strictly 
Mr. Rutter and his own input through the military

22:52.265 --> 22:59.413
circle.

23:01.790 --> 23:10.161
In your own work, when you went over to become an 
administrator, your laboratory work ceased. Is

23:10.822 --> 23:11.303
that right? Or did you continue? Essentially,

23:12.745 --> 23:20.035
I was made chairman of the department. before I was 
in higher administration in the School of

23:21.652 --> 23:32.124
Agriculture to run the Department of Plant 
Physiology and Pathology, which later became

23:21.652 --> 23:32.124
called Plant Sciences. During that tenure, one of 
the first things, Mr. Rutter had just come in in

23:34.006 --> 23:39.773
1958. It was through his intercession that we got 
the Plant Science building. Askey told him what I

23:47.302 --> 23:58.341
wanted done was a new plant science building, and 
it came about, even though he wasn't officially

23:47.302 --> 23:58.341
the president at that time.

24:00.852 --> 24:12.327
Even though I had an office and a laboratory in the 
plant science building, I never used it much

24:00.852 --> 24:12.327
except to meet with the graduate students that I 
was finishing up. I soon learned that you couldn't

24:12.347 --> 24:14.890
wear three hats. You couldn't be a good 
administrator and be a good faculty member, too,

24:15.351 --> 24:22.540
even though Mr. Rutter kept telling me that I could 
do all of that stuff. In fact, that's the way he

24:24.764 --> 24:29.734
convinced me to go into administration, saying, 
oh, you can still do research. You can still teach.

24:31.237 --> 24:34.864
Oh, yeah, just like administration was a side 
issue, like hell it was. Now, in your teaching

24:36.868 --> 24:40.535
days, how many doctoral students did you direct? 
Do you remember?

24:44.305 --> 24:51.041
I don't remember exactly, but both master's 
degree and doctorate, they were well over 60,

24:44.305 --> 24:51.041
between 60 and 75. I think the doctorates were 
about 23, as I recall. I could look it up if you need

24:58.902 --> 25:00.785
to know. The research that you did on cotton, you 
started that after you got down here? Oh, yeah, I'd

25:06.272 --> 25:07.354
never seen it. Well, I'd seen a cotton plant in the 
greenhouse, but I didn't know anything about

25:07.374 --> 25:11.640
cotton, no. I was from the Middle West. That's what 
I thought. It was corn or wheat or cattle, yeah,

25:13.943 --> 25:17.828
sure. All right, now, what was your primary crop, 
research crop in Kentucky? Well, the Little Eye

25:23.607 --> 25:33.361
tobacco was the main research crop there at the 
university and on the experiment station. But I

25:33.982 --> 25:36.986
wasn't there long enough to really get involved. I 
did some minor research and consultation on the

25:37.006 --> 25:46.180
tobacco, but I was working mostly on the origin of 
ethylene in plants. And if anything that was

25:46.600 --> 25:50.526
associated, I thought, well, that I would work 
with. I was employed internally as a teacher. I

25:54.473 --> 25:56.677
didn't have any research appointment in 
Kentucky. I did research, but I didn't have any

25:58.039 --> 25:59.923
appointment. When you got down here, how long did 
it take you to jump into the cotton? One year. When I

26:07.076 --> 26:08.498
came, Dr. Lewis, R.D. Lewis, director of the Ag 
Experiment Station. In my initial meeting with

26:13.844 --> 26:19.349
him, I promised he would get me a 25% appointment. I 
asked him for it the first year, and he said he

26:19.389 --> 26:24.735
couldn't bring it about because things were 
tough, hard up at that time. But the second year, he

26:25.535 --> 26:28.919
came through on his agreement. Describe Dr. Lewis 
and his role at Texas A&M. Well, Dr. Lewis, like

26:35.410 --> 26:41.841
many of the early A&M leaders, was a no-nonsense 
man. He was strictly business, but that doesn't

26:43.143 --> 26:48.131
mean that he was mechanical or anything like that. 
He was a caring person too, but he expected you to do

26:48.932 --> 26:54.341
your job and to do it right. And if you didn't, then 
you caught hell from him. He and I got along quite

26:57.767 --> 27:01.333
well because Well, one reason, his son was in my 
class that I taught in the first year I was here, and

27:01.313 --> 27:11.635
his son went home and told his dad, Wayne Hall's a 
hell of a good teacher. That's what he told me

27:11.655 --> 27:12.958
later. Very good. Now, he had not, Lewis had not, 
he's not a native Texan. No, he came here from Ohio,

27:20.821 --> 27:26.473
and I believe he was from Ohio originally, or maybe 
it was Missouri. It was one of the Midwest states. I

27:27.856 --> 27:30.101
don't know, but I think it was the Midwest. And I 
remember on the Aspirations Committee, he seemed

27:30.562 --> 27:36.214
to me to have clear foresight. he could see a broad 
horizon. Can I take a brief? Missed

27:41.647 --> 27:46.078
opportunities. Well, to start with Haskell, I've 
never been one to moan missed opportunities in my

27:46.318 --> 27:52.573
past. I know there's things that escape me and 
didn't turn out right and probably should have

27:54.672 --> 28:00.803
been done differently, but I'm not one to. But are 
there any that A&M missed? Any doors that were open

28:04.710 --> 28:08.657
that we didn't realize it and now we realize they 
were? I

28:08.677 --> 28:18.975
think we could have brought about some of the 
things faster than we accomplished.

28:21.250 --> 28:22.955
But it's a matter of building. And as you know, 
universities are not built up, even though they

28:22.995 --> 28:32.020
are built up and their reputation lags their real 
estate. Do you remember any great scholars that we

28:32.472 --> 28:36.399
almost got? Oh, yeah, there's dozens of those in 
those early days. One thing Mr. Rutter gave me as an

28:40.226 --> 28:50.565
assignment was to bring in some outstanding 
faculty, and he was willing to see that we provided

28:40.226 --> 28:50.565
he and the board members money. For a reasonable 
number, not a limited course. Oh, yeah, I remember

28:54.157 --> 29:04.129
going with Andy Suttle, for example, out on the 
West Coast, and we met with five different Nobel

28:54.157 --> 29:04.129
laureates. We were trying to entice coming in a 
couple that Andy had known at the University of

29:04.169 --> 29:16.124
Chicago, namely Dr. Libby, who was his mentor, and 
the famous chemist. His name slips me right now,

29:16.725 --> 29:19.388
but anyway. We almost got one or two of them to come 
here, but we missed out. You were asking about

29:27.882 --> 29:29.866
disappointments. That was one of my... What more 
could we have done in hindsight to have... I don't

29:35.247 --> 29:50.353
think because at that time A&M's reputation, even 
though we liked to pat ourselves on the back and say

29:35.247 --> 29:50.353
we were always great, at that time it really wasn't 
attractive to a lot of people unless they could see

29:35.247 --> 29:50.353
really a challenge to do something. The reason I 
was able to entice Dean Zehner and Dean Horace

29:50.333 --> 30:09.643
Byers to come here was to convince them that they'd 
done about all they could do at their present

29:50.333 --> 30:09.643
institutions, were well recognized, but here 
they could do something that couldn't be done

29:50.333 --> 30:09.643
elsewhere. That's one reason. But that story 
didn't carry with the Nobel laureates in the

30:11.606 --> 30:16.594
earlier days.

30:18.953 --> 30:26.128
Who identified chemistry and economics to get 
special emphasis? I think that, well, I hesitate

30:27.458 --> 30:37.153
to say that I did it alone, but I was the impetus for 
Flint. Mr. Rutter gave me almost unlimited

30:37.734 --> 30:46.127
authority to establish priorities and do things 
in the academic area and the research area within

30:37.734 --> 30:46.127
reason. Of course, I was always consulting with 
him before final approval. I remember talking to

30:50.734 --> 30:53.078
Mel Greenhut after years later. I talked Mel 
Greenhut into coming here, yeah. Did you? Sure

30:57.492 --> 30:57.973
did. Now how did you identify him? Through the 
department chairman of Grice, who you might have

31:00.818 --> 31:06.929
known. Did you? Don't recall his name. I was trying 
to recall his name. He came here, and Mel tried to

31:13.357 --> 31:16.982
get him to come here later. Oh, okay. But the real 
thing, besides getting Mel as chairman, was

31:17.984 --> 31:26.737
getting the Michigan State group as a team to come. 
We got four of them to come at once. Literally

31:29.581 --> 31:32.185
looted their department there. We paid, 
supposedly in those days, pretty good salaries.

31:36.111 --> 31:37.493
Now, and that...
