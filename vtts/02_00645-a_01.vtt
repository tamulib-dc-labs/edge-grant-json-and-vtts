00:01.837 --> 00:29.667
As a result of those Carnegie conferences, as I 
indicated before, I came to know Roger Revell, and

00:01.837 --> 00:29.667
because of my work at UCLA with Martin Johnson, I 
came to have a pretty good association with

00:01.837 --> 00:29.667
Scripps people, although I didn't really feel at 
the time that I wanted to give up my summer work at

00:30.288 --> 00:36.617
the laboratories at Corona del Mar, so I never 
formally affiliated with them. But in 54, 55, I

00:36.657 --> 00:48.193
took a year's leave, and I think that was the time I 
got a Ford Fellowship, as a matter of fact. Yeah, I

00:48.694 --> 00:59.569
got a Ford Fellowship at that time, the Ford 
Foundation, and I wanted to go down to Scripps to

00:48.694 --> 00:59.569
work on certain aspects of zooplankton that I felt 
would be valuable as commercial-type organisms.

01:11.867 --> 01:28.662
And it was then that a fellow who was president of a 
company that I better not mention, because I've

01:11.867 --> 01:28.662
never had clearance from that group, read about my 
going on leave and some of the things I was

01:11.867 --> 01:28.662
interested in. In

01:29.553 --> 01:40.866
the Los Angeles Times, I read this article, and he 
made arrangements to come and see me. He was

01:40.906 --> 01:42.167
president of this company. He had a nice yacht, and 
he had

01:42.187 --> 01:53.780
some high-flung ideas of getting vitamins from 
the sea. So I went to Scripps, established myself,

01:58.713 --> 02:08.287
went out on the vessel, collected some samples, 
began working, when this man appeared at the door

01:58.713 --> 02:08.287
and said, I'm so-and-so, I'd like to talk with you. 
Could you have lunch? So we went out and had lunch,

02:09.189 --> 02:25.933
and it turns out he was a chemist from Columbia, 
become the president of this company, and he

02:09.189 --> 02:25.933
wanted to get vitamin A from the sea. And So I told 
him I really didn't have that much interest in that

02:28.126 --> 02:35.356
topic and didn't know much about it. Well, we got 
along pretty well. So he said, well, what about

02:38.260 --> 02:41.704
coming to Catalina on my yacht? And we'll discuss 
this on the weekend. So I went over and had a nice set

02:45.169 --> 02:51.838
of small boats. Had a lot of fun at Catalina Island 
looking over marine specimens, which served me

02:52.139 --> 03:04.475
well later because I had to aid NSF in picking a site 
for the University of Southern California Marine

02:52.139 --> 03:04.475
Laboratory over there. And I came to know that 
coast fairly well, in part because of that

03:06.138 --> 03:12.626
three-day weekend we spent over there. But he 
finally prevailed upon me to read in this topic,

03:14.288 --> 03:21.538
and agreed to pay me just for reading for him. It was 
really kind of a silly arrangement, but it worked

03:26.833 --> 03:34.340
out beautifully to supplement my salary, which 
wasn't too great. And I provided him reports. And

03:37.363 --> 03:40.566
then he asked me if I wouldn't establish an office 
in his plant. And he had very nice offices, which I

03:41.887 --> 03:48.053
did eventually. I got in touch with the Ford 
Foundation, and said, I have had an opportunity to

03:51.117 --> 04:02.611
develop a much more practical kind of problem than 
I'd ever anticipated. Would it be all right with

04:02.631 --> 04:06.977
you if I switch over to this? And after some time on 
the phone, they said, why not? So I did. I then got

04:12.704 --> 04:17.530
interested in Krill. These are euphausid 
organisms in the Antarctic.

04:25.503 --> 04:33.435
And the reason I did is because they had an 
extremely high vitamin A content in the eyes. And

04:33.455 --> 04:38.802
by the way, it also was the largest euphausid known 
and still is. And so I thought, OK, perhaps this

04:40.525 --> 04:45.492
will be fine. This might satisfy this gentleman's 
needs. Well, it turns out that he got more and more

04:49.651 --> 04:54.415
enthused every time I turned in a report. So he 
said, I'm hiring a marine architect who will be

04:55.416 --> 05:01.743
your associate. And what I want you to do is devise a 
ship that will be ideal for collecting marine

05:01.763 --> 05:11.632
organisms for this purpose, a research vessel. 
And I want a real one. Well, we discovered a hull in

05:14.918 --> 05:20.144
Long Beach Harbor, which might have been redone. 
It was Howard Hughes' old yacht, the Oceanus.

05:25.791 --> 05:32.198
Fantastic vessel, but not really too good for this 
purpose. However, in 1950-51, the Danish

05:33.780 --> 05:44.453
government had sent the Galatea around the world 
on a deep-sea expedition It was led by Anton Bruhn,

05:45.732 --> 06:00.370
who was at the

05:45.732 --> 06:00.370
Copenhagen University, was curator of their 
museum, and was himself an ichthyologist. He led

06:00.751 --> 06:12.145
that expedition, which was noteworthy because of 
many things, but one of them was that it dredged in

06:00.751 --> 06:12.145
the deepest trench known in the Pacific. And it was 
the first time that they had ever been able to get a

06:12.850 --> 06:18.498
dredge that deep. And they brought up life, 
definitely proved there was life in the deep sea,

06:18.518 --> 06:25.148
in the deepest part of the sea. At any rate, the 
Galatea, I learned, was up for sale in Copenhagen

06:25.168 --> 06:35.662
Harbor. So I mentioned this to this man, the 
vitaminologist, and he said, go. So the marine

06:41.842 --> 06:44.526
architect and I decided we would go. Well, the 
Galatea had the largest deep-sea winch then

06:45.647 --> 06:56.463
available, and it had also a tapered cable. That 
is, it was a very large cable to base, tapered to

06:57.645 --> 07:10.363
very fine cable, so that they could have as many 
miles of cable out as needed to get to the bottom

06:57.645 --> 07:10.363
without the cable snapping under its own weight. 
Roger Revell, who was then director of Scripps

07:12.706 --> 07:32.515
Institution, and who had seen to it that I had 
adequate space and everything at Scripps to work,

07:12.706 --> 07:32.515
commissioned me through the United States Navy to 
attempt to buy this winch and the cable. And so I

07:32.535 --> 07:40.266
traveled under the aegis of more than one group, as 
a matter of fact. The United States Navy gave me the

07:45.363 --> 07:56.219
rank of an admiral, and I traveled anywhere on 
orders for them in order to do this service. And I

07:56.880 --> 08:03.290
had an excellent experience. However, I was in and 
out of Scripps, and really, although Roger said, I

08:10.317 --> 08:16.323
must give you the title of research associate, 
which gives you a great deal of freedom. You can

08:16.944 --> 08:21.329
represent us officially, but you don't have to do 
anything. And so I became the first and maybe the

08:21.509 --> 08:27.495
only research associate in Scripps. But I had a 
magnificent experience. I came to know Anton

08:32.421 --> 08:38.367
Bruhn very well and Gunnar Thorson. who was a 
leading Danish biologist, marine biologist, and

08:39.005 --> 08:46.613
came to be world recognized.

08:52.639 --> 09:01.088
And later, of course, he invited me to go to his lab 
to work at Elsinore, just outside Kronborg

08:52.639 --> 09:01.088
Castle. It

09:01.949 --> 09:07.915
was just outside the lab window.

09:09.245 --> 09:12.169
But you see, one thing leads to another. But that 
experience was excellent for me. I got to know many

09:15.714 --> 09:31.936
of the then active scientists at Scripps, and

09:15.714 --> 09:31.936
I got to know many of the scientists around the 
world. Did you purchase the boat? I placed the

09:34.159 --> 09:38.104
order for it. then resigned. I never saw it. They 
got it, and he gave it, I believe, eventually to

09:41.444 --> 09:45.589
Scripps. I don't remember what the name is now. No, 
for many reasons I had to correct. He wanted me...

09:56.384 --> 10:02.912
He came under the influence of Mr. Merck. Merck

10:02.932 --> 10:06.537
Chemical. And ask him what he should do with his 
business. He was getting to be alone in years and

10:09.907 --> 10:16.056
making fantastic amounts of money. And Merck had 
said that what you should do

10:16.076 --> 10:34.264
was pick three men and gradually turn the business 
over to those three men, stock and whatever. So he

10:35.054 --> 10:41.040
called the three of us in individually and then 
together and said, I picked you three to take over

10:35.054 --> 10:41.040
my business. He was then 70. And he said, I now want 
you to get used to

10:43.342 --> 10:51.671
living a good life. And so he began giving us 
retainers of 2,000 a week. Gave me a Cadillac, use

10:57.296 --> 11:01.801
of his yacht, anything I wanted. Well, when I went 
to Europe, I was to entertain the near great or the

11:05.395 --> 11:12.426
great anywhere that I could, which we didn't do. I 
wasn't geared to that kind of life. Nor was I geared

11:13.588 --> 11:14.630
to the other. So I told him in a long letter from 
Europe that when I came back, that I had discharged

11:15.331 --> 11:24.365
what I said I would do. I had got plans through. 
Stokkenwerft Shipyard in Hamburg, and I let It

11:33.560 --> 11:35.903
would have been a nice life, you know, in a way. I 
would have inherited quite a fortune. But I was

11:40.287 --> 11:44.952
somebody he liked particularly. He looked upon me 
as his son and stuff. But it wasn't the life. So.

11:53.642 --> 11:57.566
What became of whatever research that there was 
that you were supposed to be involved with? Well,

11:57.586 --> 12:03.432
about all I did was write a paper, which was 
published in Scientific American in 1958. and

12:04.745 --> 12:10.617
which Scientific American told me the other day 
has sold more than any other. They've sold 124,000

12:10.637 --> 12:15.025
copies of that alphabet.

12:18.652 --> 12:20.877
It was on whales, plankton, and man. Remember that 
crazy thing? That appeared in an English text.

12:25.400 --> 12:30.667
It's used in a freshman English reading book, as a 
matter of fact. And it's been two or three times

12:30.687 --> 12:34.832
published in various books. I don't know. It was 
one of those things I thought was fascinating.

12:39.418 --> 12:41.340
There's some mistakes in it, a lot of other things. 
But at any rate, it worked out pretty

12:41.360 --> 12:46.066
interestingly. But that was what I did, was 
delivered a lecture. I was invited to give a

12:50.111 --> 12:53.415
faculty lecture at Caltech one afternoon. And 
they said they wanted something that the Caltech

12:55.319 --> 12:59.543
people ordinarily didn't hear. So I decided to do 
that. And I wrote this. Well, the kind of thing they

13:04.688 --> 13:13.577
got then was, to a great extent, molecular kinds of 
things. And so I decided to put that manuscript

13:13.637 --> 13:24.068
together and

13:13.637 --> 13:24.068
deliver a lecture on it. I was also writing it up. in 
a little more technical vein. When I finished, a

13:30.365 --> 13:39.336
man came up and said, Gerard Peel, who was a 
publisher of Scientific Americans, a good friend

13:30.365 --> 13:39.336
of mine, and he really ought to have that 
manuscript. He said, that's something that ought

13:40.237 --> 13:42.559
to be published. That's really interesting. So, 
you know, they didn't have any referent against

13:44.862 --> 13:52.731
which to judge it outside of the fact that this was 
interesting to them. So I said, fine. Before long,

13:57.139 --> 14:03.767
I got a call from Flanagan, who was the editor of 
Scientific American, and said, I understand

13:57.139 --> 14:03.767
you've got this. Would you mind sending that 
manuscript to us? And I said, no. I'll send it. So I

14:08.212 --> 14:08.892
sent it. In about two weeks, I got a check for $400. 
And I said, good God. I didn't know Scientific

14:13.157 --> 14:15.720
American paid for articles. So I got this check 
with a letter saying, we're going to find a place

14:17.202 --> 14:23.089
for this in the next year or so. We want it. Well, two 
weeks later, I got a frantic call saying, where can

14:26.085 --> 14:29.550
we get some artwork? We're going to put that 
article in right now. That was in November of 58, I

14:33.295 --> 14:40.865
think, and the thing came out in December issue, so 
it went fast. Why, I don't know. But I then got calls

14:43.809 --> 14:48.035
from all over the world about that. Is this thing 
really edible? Is it good? Would it be useful? All

14:52.101 --> 14:53.042
this kind of stuff. And from shrimpers down here, 
afraid the shrimpers were going out, they wanted

14:53.579 --> 15:04.372
to know could they take their shrimp fleets and go 
down there and get these things. So it went. And the

15:05.854 --> 15:18.349
last call was from Jacques-Yves Cousteau asking 
where he could get krill in largest amounts two

15:05.854 --> 15:18.349
years ago, just before he went to Antarctica. But 
they're still selling it. They're still selling

15:20.111 --> 15:21.312
it. As a consequence, Freeman, who's been 
publishing the book, the publisher, phoned the

15:23.633 --> 15:41.097
other day and asked if I would now edit a series of 
off-prints in a coherent group for them on the

15:23.633 --> 15:41.097
natural history of marine organisms, you know, 
putting a lot of them together as a package. And I

15:41.117 --> 15:46.605
said then, hey, how's Wells Plankton and Mann 
doing these days? He said, I got to. I got, I think, a

15:49.283 --> 15:51.585
half cent for each one. I usually get a check for 
$100 or $120 every year. It doesn't mean anything,

15:55.550 --> 16:01.756
but they've been selling a lot of them. He said, 
hey, still one of our best sellers, except they're

16:01.776 --> 16:06.922
around $124,000.

16:12.507 --> 16:17.873
So that's how that thing came about. And today, of 
course, the Japanese and the Russians are fish and

16:18.157 --> 16:28.513
krill in the Antarctic.

16:28.533 --> 16:35.645
And El Sayed here has much more interest in the 
Antarctic than I do, so he's got that end of the

16:28.533 --> 16:35.645
scale. But I tell you, when I went to Europe trying 
to convince the Norwegians, I wanted the

16:35.685 --> 16:45.480
Norwegians, who were then the great whalers, to 
give me one of their whale catchers and part of the

16:46.405 --> 16:54.898
time on their factor ship to harvest krill. The man 
radar, or sonar, was just coming in as a result of

16:54.918 --> 17:04.011
its development during the war. And they were 
using that to try to detect whales and the krill was

17:04.031 --> 17:08.358
getting in their way. It was noise. And I learned 
something. They said, You may not know it, but the

17:16.460 --> 17:22.767
British owned all of the Norwegian wedding fleet. 
So I went to England and got nowhere. They had money

17:27.893 --> 17:29.055
coming in. They weren't interested in anything 
else. That's when I realized that, although my

17:30.717 --> 17:42.991
mother was British, that British don't have as 
much imagination in financial things that you

17:30.717 --> 17:42.991
would like

17:30.717 --> 17:42.991
sometimes. I think this has been borne out in more 
ways than one. They just turned me down flat and

17:45.856 --> 17:49.520
said, it's a dream. And we've got the real thing 
now. So they entertained me royally, but I never

17:53.665 --> 17:59.371
got into it. But now it is important and may prove to 
be even more important. What we need now, of

18:03.415 --> 18:06.919
course, is much more in the way of studies than 
we've ever had before. There are men who knew so

18:07.419 --> 18:10.303
much more than I did about this. I visited with them 
at the National Oceanographic Institute at

18:10.403 --> 18:14.327
Wormley. in England and the British Museum and so 
on. But no one of them then saw this potential. They

18:24.692 --> 18:25.794
didn't see it at all. For some reason, I don't know. 
But we need studies now to really be sure how much

18:28.638 --> 18:41.357
that stock can sustain because it is good food. And 
there's no reason in the world why It shouldn't

18:44.952 --> 18:54.245
have really, and what I tried to entice them with, 
should become a gourmet

18:44.952 --> 18:54.245
food. By the way, have you seen this book by Muriel 
L. Gouberlet in 1964 on explorers of the sea,

18:54.265 --> 19:07.143
famous oceanographic expeditions? Yes. My wife 
wanted to be sure that you saw that. We have not read

19:14.315 --> 19:16.358
it. Well, she thought maybe you might get some 
ideas out of it. At any rate, she thought it was also

19:19.242 --> 19:33.500
interesting that we both came up with this idea 
that a hundred years ago, on the 24th of May, the

19:19.242 --> 19:33.500
Challenger expedition returned to England after 
its three and a half year of launch. And that is darn

19:33.520 --> 19:34.782
interesting. You can have that if you want. I think 
I had the book in my office, but just in case I don't,

19:35.904 --> 19:42.933
Monty may have to pick it up to look at it. Uh... I 
want to also know about the work with the ONR in 1956

19:44.909 --> 19:49.235
and in 1964. Did you have two separate grants from 
the Office of Labor Research? Oh, yeah, a long

19:54.041 --> 19:57.266
period of time I had grants. Well,

19:58.687 --> 20:10.343
there's a book being written now on the history of 
scuba diving in the United States. And they're

20:11.774 --> 20:15.358
going to start the history of 1950. But actually, 
it started earlier than that.

20:23.588 --> 20:29.616
Outside of the military, I think I bought the first 
scuba gear that was used in this country. And

20:31.999 --> 20:33.380
here's the way it came about. And that's why the 
Navy got involved.

20:39.500 --> 20:51.656
I was then editor of a very Mickey Mouse small 
journal that had had a long and distinguished

20:39.500 --> 20:51.656
history, but was getting a little out of date. It 
didn't have enough budget to compete. It was

20:53.999 --> 21:01.850
called the Journal of Entomology and Zoology, 
which had been started in the turn of the century at

20:53.999 --> 21:01.850
Pomona College. And there were a lot of good things 
that had been published in it. in a period of time,

21:07.006 --> 21:09.729
some 50 years. But it had been particularly 
important for exchanging with European

21:10.269 --> 21:15.435
journals, free exchange. And the library at 
Pomona College had more foreign journals than

21:15.675 --> 21:21.902
many universities.

21:23.744 --> 21:33.334
But as an editor of that magazine, I was approached 
one day by a Frenchman by the name of Rene of

21:23.744 --> 21:33.334
Westwood. village outside of UCLA who had a big 
sporting goods store. He was a friend of Jacques

21:37.904 --> 21:41.468
Cousteau. And Jacques had asked him if he would 
merchandise this thing that was called the

21:41.488 --> 21:52.480
Aqualon. It was then the regulator was fabricated 
in France and the tanks in Canada. This man phoned

22:02.575 --> 22:11.946
me, this Rene, and said, would I carry an 
advertisement in the journal for his aqualung?

22:11.966 --> 22:13.908
And I said, gee, what is it? He said, it is an 
underwater breathing apparatus. It was not then

22:16.871 --> 22:19.814
called scuba.

22:22.658 --> 22:31.047
And it will permit one to stay underwater for 
several minutes, up to half an hour, depending on

22:22.658 --> 22:31.047
depth. free diving. So I said, well, I certainly 
couldn't do that. But click, click, click, in my

22:38.899 --> 22:52.479
mind was, man, if you could really do this, how nice 
it would be in summer sessions when I needed marine

22:38.899 --> 22:52.479
specimens to work with and experimental 
embryology and so on, to be able to go out any time

22:38.899 --> 22:52.479
and not wait for a low tide. So I said, I will carry 
your ad if and only if I approve of this device in the

22:52.920 --> 23:01.472
swimming pool. at Pomona College. So he said, I'll 
be out the next day before he came. I strapped one of

23:06.056 --> 23:11.683
these things on, and I saw the potential was 
magnificent. And so I bought it and began using it

23:11.703 --> 23:19.193
at Corona Del Mar. I used it about the last of my life 
several times because, of course, you had no buddy

23:19.213 --> 23:22.658
system. Nobody else had one around. That was 1948. 
Fortunately, I advertised it in the journal, and

23:25.361 --> 23:30.328
the first ad appeared in 48, 49 academic year.

23:37.623 --> 23:40.668
Well, I then began going off the coast. And I found 
things in the underwater environment that I just

23:40.708 --> 23:45.176
didn't know existed there. And nobody else did, 
even though many good biologists had been along

23:45.316 --> 23:50.264
that coast for 50 years. I saw things they had never 
seen, didn't even think existed there. So I wrote

23:55.312 --> 23:58.257
the Office of Naval Research about this. And 
Sidney Galler, who is now, I think, one of the

23:59.013 --> 24:13.509
assistant secretaries of commerce, was then in 
head of the biological section of the Office of

23:59.013 --> 24:13.509
Native Research. And I said, you know, I think this 
has great potential. And I have a problem I would

24:19.015 --> 24:23.419
like to work on there. There's some rock material 
under there that I'd really like to examine very

24:23.459 --> 24:28.665
thoroughly. and this makes it possible to do it 
quantitatively, and so on. So he came out to

24:32.751 --> 24:39.599
California, and we discussed this, and they gave 
me grants. And then I went on with that for some

24:40.740 --> 24:44.385
time. And later,

24:46.567 --> 24:55.858
when I came here, when I went to NSF, of course, it 
all had to stop. When I came here, the Navy, not only

24:59.290 --> 25:06.581
gave me grants to go on with that, but they also gave 
me grants to work in the deep sea. And they did this

25:06.601 --> 25:22.545
until

25:06.601 --> 25:22.545
it became very evident that the action in the 
United States was going to be on the Commonwealth

25:06.601 --> 25:22.545
shelf. Everyone was coming to be interested in the 
Commonwealth shelf. So I'm very glad I had my

25:25.413 --> 25:50.997
chance in the deep sea, and this book I look upon as 
being something that I've just got to put, because

25:25.413 --> 25:50.997
14 or 15 cruises

25:25.413 --> 25:50.997
on the Gulf of Mexico

25:25.413 --> 25:50.997
can't go without some kind of recording. But it's a 
hell of a job getting all this stuff identified.

25:55.062 --> 25:58.687
There's no way to do it easily and quickly. But my 
wife and I have had, as a result, we've picked

25:58.707 --> 26:04.856
certain groups of organisms that we had to work 
with. And we've made a lot of good friends around

26:04.876 --> 26:09.042
the world as a result. In Japan, France, we've had 
French scientists visiting us, Japanese and so

26:09.062 --> 26:19.857
on, as a result of this work. We specialized in the 
crustaceans. It's given my wife something she

26:21.659 --> 26:23.702
likes to do. And so we are really most appreciative 
of the great support that ONR gave us. I hate to see

26:32.738 --> 26:35.182
ONR go down the tubes. Well, is ONR going down? 
Well, it's hard to say. They certainly, I have not

26:38.727 --> 26:47.400
felt in good confidence I could ask them for any 
more money for seven years. But part of the reason

26:48.381 --> 26:52.187
for that was that Senator I've forgotten

26:53.450 --> 26:58.174
who it is now. I wanted to say Magnuson, but it's not 
Magnuson. From Montana, whatever his name is.

27:03.198 --> 27:03.999
Mahoney? No, not Mahoney. It begins with M, 
though. At any rate, he indicated that ONR should

27:07.702 --> 27:17.630
not support any but missionary research. 
Research directed toward the mission of the Navy.

27:21.173 --> 27:23.355
This came to be acoustics. And they asked me if I 
could in any way turn my work into acoustics. And I

27:27.629 --> 27:31.053
tried one year, and my heart wasn't in it. What is 
acoustics? Transmission of sound in the sea and

27:32.875 --> 27:46.270
those factors, biological and otherwise, that 
cause aberrations in sound transmission.

27:47.371 --> 27:53.798
But ONR has been cut down, and there's been some 
long debate as to whether it would actually

27:47.371 --> 27:53.798
continue. Part of the reason for the problem is 
that the Navy wants to move that part of the Office

27:54.082 --> 28:04.854
of Naval Research to Bay St. Louis, Mississippi. 
And there's been a great fight against it. Whether

28:08.098 --> 28:08.778
that will be done or not. Are you conversing with 
them? Did you know this? You know NASA had that big

28:10.861 --> 28:16.067
installation over there that they built and never 
used? It's a gigantic installation. Magnificent

28:18.930 --> 28:21.793
computer center. All the Washington people feel 
it's in the backwash of the world, and they don't

28:22.432 --> 28:28.955
want to go. So ONR may come to a gradual stop.
