00:01.280 --> 00:18.467
Richard Rodman, who had gone to the Peace Corps in 
Ecuador, he actually married an Ecuadorian girl

00:01.280 --> 00:18.467
later on and went in to work with the United States 
Agency for International Development. And so he

00:19.228 --> 00:23.394
kind of made a life of foreign service. And I think a 
lot of people really continued to seek different

00:28.769 --> 00:38.102
kinds of opportunities in international 
settings after their Peace Corps work. A lot of

00:39.704 --> 00:51.520
them went back and did work in Washington, D.C. in 
various parts of government programs.

00:53.761 --> 01:04.012
What was the one memory or feeling that most stood 
out about your whole experience

00:53.761 --> 01:04.012
in Peace Corps? Or two or three memories. I'm sure

01:04.812 --> 01:18.466
there are several. Let's see, one simple memory.

01:29.519 --> 01:44.133
Well, of course, it's always something that 
indelibly

01:29.519 --> 01:44.133
is in your mind when you live through a shooting 
revolution. And when we first got there, we were

01:44.153 --> 01:51.140
very idealistic. And when the shooting war 
actually broke out, And we had to get behind

01:59.354 --> 02:08.990
mattresses that were propped against the walls. 
And you could actually see tracer bullets go

02:09.150 --> 02:17.183
flying across the valley. And actually, one 
military post was shooting at another.

02:27.468 --> 02:42.571
this kind of

02:27.468 --> 02:42.571
you hear planes flying overhead and bombing and 
you realize that you're actually part of this

02:27.468 --> 02:42.571
thing. I guess it was pretty terrorizing. Then 
later when they had the daily

03:00.357 --> 03:06.750
I guess the curfew and I would go out in the late 
afternoon. One time I stayed a little bit too late

03:06.770 --> 03:17.351
at one place and I had to go back and get to my 
family's house. I had to dodge behind a wall. At one

03:24.000 --> 03:43.990
point I was challenged by a guard at a corner down 
the valley and he actually wheeled around and

03:24.000 --> 03:43.990
fired a couple shots in my direction and so I had to 
dive behind this adobe wall to avoid being shot. I

03:44.010 --> 03:49.078
sort of crept along like a an outlaw and eventually 
got back to the house that I was living in. But it was

03:55.782 --> 04:04.837
just kind of this kind of tension and it's almost 
like being in a war zone. How it all started, I think

04:04.877 --> 04:14.914
that was very difficult to live with. And then as 
things began to settle down, I guess the real charm

04:16.750 --> 04:26.720
of the Bolivians started to come out. And overall, 
they were very hospitable people. They would

04:34.207 --> 04:36.970
invite you into their home. And they'd really give 
you everything that they have or let you share

04:44.577 --> 04:47.421
everything that they have. I think we had really a 
lot of positive interaction with the people

04:49.184 --> 04:55.253
themselves. We made a lot of friends within the 
Bolivian community. We wrote letters to them many

05:01.822 --> 05:06.990
years after that. You know, it's just one of those 
kind of things where you have those memories for

05:07.223 --> 05:16.033
forever. And of course, you know, just being 
married in a country like that, this whole setting

05:16.053 --> 05:27.465
is almost like out of a storybook.

05:32.491 --> 05:36.235
But I don't know if there's any one They

05:36.738 --> 05:44.547
were good things and bad things. We generally took 
advantage of every opportunity when we would have

05:44.707 --> 05:58.604
a weekend free or something to go and see as much of 
the country as possible. And a lot of times we would

05:59.285 --> 06:06.373
just go out to the town square and very early in the 
morning, They had these big trucks that would be

06:06.640 --> 06:16.253
going off to various places like once we went to 
Chulamani. We would just go there and the people

06:17.615 --> 06:26.286
that were loading up the trucks, they would tell 
you where they're going. And then so you just climb

06:26.587 --> 06:35.322
on the back of the truck and you pay them a small fee 
for taking you there. And by the time you actually

06:35.342 --> 06:41.052
got there, they would stop along the way and pick up 
other people. There may be a dozen people in the

06:41.386 --> 06:48.916
back of one of these trucks by the time it actually 
gets there. They just have big canvas flaps over

06:48.996 --> 06:56.846
them so if it rains or whatever then they can at 
least keep the people dry. But that was one of the

06:56.866 --> 07:00.851
main modes of transportation. You just jumped on 
the back of one of these trucks and off you go.

07:06.648 --> 07:35.085
During the trip itself, they would, you know, 
they'd have, like, some of their potatoes that are

07:06.648 --> 07:35.085
these dried potatoes, they're called chunyo, and 
they would have these wrapped up in their bundles

07:06.648 --> 07:35.085
on their back, and at some point they would get out 
their stuff, and everybody would be sharing all

07:06.648 --> 07:35.085
their food, so they'd pass around the chunyo and 
their various... little tidbits of snacks that

07:36.061 --> 07:39.686
they would have. And they'd just share it all 
around with everyone that was on the truck ride. So

07:46.817 --> 07:55.110
it was really a very simple type of existence. And 
you just see that the level of trusting of the

07:55.130 --> 08:04.043
people at that time was very genuine. It may not be 
like that today, particularly with all of the

08:04.765 --> 08:24.411
stress of the cocaine trade and the shining path, 
the gorillas, these sendero luminosos that are

08:04.765 --> 08:24.411
there stirring up additional problems in the 
countryside, people would probably not be as open

08:24.982 --> 08:34.735
as they were back in the mid-60s. Maybe those times 
are gone forever, but it just seemed like they were

08:36.217 --> 08:54.803
almost so willing to accept foreigners and treat 
you like any member of their community. share

08:55.340 --> 09:00.365
whatever they have and sort of be very open. Maybe 
it was just their naive way of looking at things,

09:00.385 --> 09:06.491
but it was kind of refreshing. It's almost like 
living in a very small town in the USA or

09:06.511 --> 09:16.201
something. That's one thing that we definitely 
will probably remember about our Peace Corps

09:16.221 --> 09:23.828
experience. Did you ever worry about getting sick 
when you ate the native foods? Well, you always had

09:29.718 --> 09:33.362
to worry about being sick. The water had to be 
boiled and also had to be filtered. Yet, when you

09:41.651 --> 09:48.499
went someplace, like you were at a faculty get 
together and somebody offered you water, you

09:48.935 --> 09:58.631
never were really sure, you know, was this boiled 
or was it not boiled. And eventually, playing

09:58.751 --> 10:15.398
these kind of games, you wound up getting amoebic 
dysentery or you would get some kind of parasites.

10:15.833 --> 10:40.575
My wife had amoebic dysentery while she was 
pregnant and the medication that you had to take in

10:15.833 --> 10:40.575
order to kill the amoebas that were eating in her 
liver were also very dangerous and could cause

10:15.833 --> 10:40.575
some kind of difficulties for the for the 
pregnancy itself may even cause abnormal

10:42.226 --> 11:09.938
abnormalities in the fetus and so we had a lot of 
sort of stress and tension during pregnancy not

10:42.226 --> 11:09.938
knowing you know how it was going to work out and 
then as you recall from The actual birth

11:10.306 --> 11:37.950
experience itself, when the other girl and her 
baby died on the same night that our first son was

11:10.306 --> 11:37.950
born, it was almost a miracle that this little 
five-pound infant was able to survive in that kind

11:10.306 --> 11:37.950
of a primitive setting.

11:37.970 --> 11:39.351
But it all worked out. Just one more question. When 
you returned to the, finally returned to the

11:41.956 --> 11:47.528
States, was there a strong sense of culture shock? 
What did you view differently?

11:51.977 --> 11:56.226
When we first came back, we stopped in Panama. My 
wife had grown up in the Panama Canal Zone and she

11:58.214 --> 12:08.488
wanted me to see Panama and some of the area that she 
grew up in. So we flew into Panama and we stayed in an

12:08.648 --> 12:17.640
apartment that was a friend of hers in Panama. She 
was away on vacation, so she just let us drive her

12:22.914 --> 12:29.027
car and stay in her apartment. We had been so 
accustomed to living almost like from hand to

12:30.269 --> 12:35.680
mouth. In our two years there, there were no 
supermarkets. You went to the open market, you

12:39.746 --> 12:49.967
bought your little parcel of food, and you used it 
up in a day or two, and then you went back to the

12:39.746 --> 12:49.967
market again. We got to Panama, into the Canal 
Zone, and suddenly, You could take long showers

12:58.137 --> 13:09.696
with hot water and you go out and there's a 
refrigerator and you look in there and there's all

12:58.137 --> 13:09.696
this stuff. It's just beyond belief that 
everything could be so easy. You had difficulty

13:18.471 --> 13:21.816
making decisions. Even when you went back and you 
went to the stores, supermarkets, and so forth,

13:22.218 --> 13:37.940
you were so overwhelmed by the variety and the 
packaging and so forth, you had forgotten about

13:22.218 --> 13:37.940
all this sort of thing. And it made such an impact on 
you that it was difficult to deal with. You were

13:43.768 --> 13:50.537
used to having your little string bag and having 
everything in a raw state with no packaging. And

13:50.888 --> 13:55.133
then here is all this stuff that's sort of triple 
packaged. And not only is there not one variety of

13:55.994 --> 14:03.383
these things, but there's 16 of them to choose 
from. And you have difficulty making your

14:03.463 --> 14:08.429
purchases. And you're just sort of awestruck. And 
so it took us a while to get back into, the idea that

14:18.513 --> 14:38.007
we do have so much and so many opportunities and 
we're sort of, I don't know if you would call it

14:18.513 --> 14:38.007
wasteful, but it's certainly a different kind of

14:18.513 --> 14:38.007
way to do You know, you're selling and buying, and 
it's so different from the basic nature of things

14:38.864 --> 14:50.947
in Bolivia or any of the third world countries.

14:54.373 --> 15:00.585
So I guess that was, that was definitely a culture 
shock for us.

15:01.679 --> 15:06.496
just the idea of driving again in automobiles. You 
don't do it for two years, you're sort of in public

15:06.516 --> 15:13.782
transit.

15:14.352 --> 15:21.721
as you get back on the road, and everything seems to 
be moving much faster, you know, when you get back.

15:21.942 --> 15:30.593
And so you're almost sort of bewildered for a 
while, until things begin to come back into focus.

15:32.936 --> 15:38.683
It's just something that we notice, and we weren't 
quite prepared for. And then you're sort of

15:38.703 --> 15:43.549
bombarded with things like television, We did 
have radio there that we listened to quite a lot,

15:44.035 --> 15:54.835
but certainly there was no TV.

15:54.855 --> 15:59.243
That was certainly something that we had to get 
used to again.

16:04.268 --> 16:07.433
Because we were there continuously for two years. 
We did have some time when we would take little

16:07.473 --> 16:10.718
trips. We did take a trip over to Peru. But for the 
most part, we were sort of in that environment

16:15.525 --> 16:22.215
continuously for the whole duration.

16:25.660 --> 16:26.441
Have you ever done that? We did take the children 
when we were in Argentina. We took a trip back to La

16:32.602 --> 16:44.214
Paz and we went to Abraha's little hospital where 
David was born. We showed the kids the apartment

16:45.535 --> 16:55.145
where we had spent our Peace Corps days and kind of 
retraced some of our old steps. I think it was

16:55.645 --> 17:00.550
really a nostalgic trip for us. I'm not sure that 
the kids got too much out of it, but certainly they

17:01.103 --> 17:07.631
were pretty young at the time.

17:10.434 --> 17:14.780
They probably remember some of it, but probably 
not too much. Mostly, when they go back and look at

17:14.800 --> 17:28.056
the photo albums of that period, you can 
continually refresh at a time when you can take it

17:14.800 --> 17:28.056
all in. and actually think you're remembering all 
that stuff, but actually you're just remembering

17:28.559 --> 17:48.929
the stories that your parents tell you, and you 
reinforce that with the pictures, and you know you

17:28.559 --> 17:48.929
were there, and how much they actually

17:28.559 --> 17:48.929
remember. I appreciate it. Okay.
