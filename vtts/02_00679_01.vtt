WEBVTT

00:01.499 --> 00:07.728
Dr. Gronemann, who has been or was in the College of 
Education before its inception, right?

00:10.973 --> 00:12.455
Today is November the 3rd. I am visiting in Dr. 
Gronemann's home, and we're going to, he's going

00:12.475 --> 00:26.475
to share a few of his perceptions and thoughts 
about happenings at Texas A&M before the College

00:12.475 --> 00:26.475
of Education became a College of Education. And 
Dr. Gronemann, can you give me a little background

00:31.705 --> 00:39.436
on what the connection was with the College of 
Engineering and this Department of Education as

00:31.705 --> 00:39.436
such. What was there? What kind of collaboration 
was there? Well, our Department of Industrial

00:44.883 --> 00:51.252
Education was within the School of Engineering. 
And

00:52.633 --> 01:01.105
obviously, our being a department of teacher 
education, We had a very close relationship with

01:02.873 --> 01:08.700
other departments who were preparing teachers. 
Primarily the department of what was known then as

01:09.982 --> 01:16.550
Education and Psychology. Prior to it becoming a 
part of the College of Education. And who was in the

01:23.699 --> 01:27.143
department, who was head of that educational 
department? Department of Education and

01:27.578 --> 01:31.042
Psychology at the time that you were working with 
them? Professor Wilcox is the first one we worked

01:31.062 --> 01:34.906
with. Succeeding him, we worked then with Dr. 
Hensarly.

01:42.835 --> 01:53.367
And how long did this continue until, until what 
time was this, was this in that, in that context

01:42.835 --> 01:53.367
where it was part of the College of Engineering?

01:56.249 --> 01:58.292
I came here in 1940.

02:02.017 --> 02:11.912
The Industrial Education Department was within 
the College of Engineering because there was no

02:02.017 --> 02:11.912
College of Education.

02:15.417 --> 02:24.670
We collaborated very closely with the Department 
of Education and Psychology, primarily with

02:15.417 --> 02:24.670
Professor Wilcox, preceding him I

02:25.308 --> 02:35.502
guess we served two deans because of this 
relationship. Correct. However, I

02:38.346 --> 02:50.202
guess we were technically a part of the College of 
Engineering, at least that's Where did your

02:50.722 --> 02:52.264
funding come from? That's where our funding came 
from.

03:00.758 --> 03:09.812
But did you get any information on when the Council 
on Teacher Education was formed or not? I'm sure

03:10.553 --> 03:12.396
it's in the documents. I don't have that verified 
yet document. With the establishment of the

03:15.741 --> 03:18.265
Council I guess it was called Council of Teacher 
Education, which embodied departments from

03:19.223 --> 03:29.940
various colleges.

03:35.148 --> 03:47.627
We reported on educational matters

03:35.148 --> 03:47.627
to the dean of education while at the same time 
keeping our own dean apprised. Actually, Dean

03:48.653 --> 03:56.183
Hubert was Dean of Liberal Arts at first. It was 
called Arts and Sciences? I guess so. And then it

03:59.607 --> 04:01.970
became Liberal Arts. Yeah. So he was the dean that 
you worked under when you were in that department.

04:08.179 --> 04:11.944
We reported to him on matters that pertained to 
teacher education. Technically, my boss was Dean

04:12.805 --> 04:17.631
Benson. Oh, okay, very good. Now, the mission of a 
college, a land-grant university, is of course

04:20.270 --> 04:27.918
teaching, research, and service. When you were in 
this department, in the Department of Industrial

04:28.499 --> 04:37.029
Education, was there a balance between those 
three? What kind of attention was given to the

04:38.370 --> 04:41.854
teaching, research, and service? Did one take 
priority over another, or were they... stressed

04:47.142 --> 04:48.184
equally?

04:50.808 --> 04:57.298
Well, I presume the major college or school was 
education.

05:00.843 --> 05:12.441
However, those of us in the separate departments 
treated the matter as a school-wide exercise. And

05:13.602 --> 05:17.948
we just merely had to keep our deans apprised of 
what we were doing. When did this Department of

05:19.571 --> 05:26.441
Industrial Education come into the College of 
Education fold? Was it when the college was

05:26.461 --> 05:32.890
initiated or after?

05:32.950 --> 05:39.680
Was it one of the departments from the very 
beginning when the college was established? You

05:40.942 --> 05:42.243
mean the College of Education? Yes, sir. 
Industrial

05:45.007 --> 05:57.479
education was not a part of the College of 
Education when the College of Education was

05:45.007 --> 05:57.479
established.

06:00.062 --> 06:07.109
We were treated, though, as it were.

06:07.449 --> 06:14.997
We took our responsibilities of departmental 
operation from the deans of our respective

06:07.449 --> 06:14.997
colleges. or schools as they were known then. So 
was there a lot of collaboration then in those days

06:18.380 --> 06:23.704
between departments like that? That had to do with 
teacher education? Right. Yes, and that included

06:28.889 --> 06:31.111
ag education. I was going to say that was the other 
branch of it. I don't recall the year that the

06:35.695 --> 06:40.079
Council on Teacher Education was established. 
But When it was established,

06:44.525 --> 07:05.007
the heads of the departments of education and 
psychology, ag education, and industrial

06:44.525 --> 07:05.007
education

06:44.525 --> 07:05.007
worked as though the council was a school or a 
college, even though they were still separate.

07:05.867 --> 07:09.291
Were you head of that department of industrial 
education? Yes. I was also coordinator of the

07:10.773 --> 07:14.076
council on teacher education. What degrees were 
offered in that department in industrial ed? A

07:21.718 --> 07:30.011
bachelor of science, a master of science, and a 
master of education.

07:33.235 --> 07:37.141
And did you have anything to do with establishing 
the doctoral program? That's what I heard. Can you

07:39.285 --> 07:40.847
tell me a little bit about that? How that came 
about?

07:45.562 --> 07:50.087
idea, how the idea started and what the process was 
to get it established?

07:53.011 --> 07:54.612
I don't know if I can. I recall there was a necessity 
for a college in the state of Texas to offer a

07:56.134 --> 08:09.610
doctorate program for teachers of industrial 
education. They preferred the teachers in the

08:11.572 --> 08:14.235
state requested that we try to set up such a program 
rather than make everyone who wanted to have a

08:16.325 --> 08:40.527
doctorate degree go through the process of

08:16.325 --> 08:40.527
doing it all in areas of general education.

08:42.683 --> 08:52.972
Those in agricultural education and in 
industrial education felt, we'd like to offer a

08:42.683 --> 08:52.972
doctorate in our field, not in general education. 
And that's how we came about. And that doctorate

08:57.076 --> 09:03.542
was offered in the department, still through the 
College of Engineering? That's right. And what

09:06.464 --> 09:08.366
kinds of classes were taught? What did you teach 
when you were in that department? What were some of

09:10.868 --> 09:12.690
the courses that you taught? Well, you mean 
generally that I taught or that we had? Well, both.

09:19.420 --> 09:30.654
Well, in industrial education, our primary 
purpose was the preparation of teachers for

09:19.420 --> 09:30.654
industrial and vocational education. 
Vocational education meaning trade and

09:30.674 --> 09:36.923
industrial education. Industrial arts being the 
group of people who were not eligible to become

09:42.826 --> 09:54.279
teachers under the vocational program due to lack 
of industrial experience.

09:57.362 --> 10:02.728
So all of the courses were basically geared to the 
industrial arts and vocational? Industrial and

10:03.288 --> 10:04.730
the vocational. Industrial arts, do you think, 
industrial arts is for those kids in school who are

10:10.366 --> 10:17.352
not particularly interested in becoming 
tradespeople. Whereas the trade and industrial

10:18.653 --> 10:40.373
program was geared to preparing teachers who 
could, in turn, because of their experience in

10:18.653 --> 10:40.373
industry,

10:18.653 --> 10:40.373
prepare high school youngsters for direct entry 
into many trades.

10:42.850 --> 10:46.473
How many years were you in that department? Well, I 
came in 1940. And retired? I

10:49.436 --> 10:56.542
retired in 1967.

10:59.005 --> 11:07.993
And then went to Fresno, California State 
University for another eight years, because they

10:59.005 --> 11:07.993
had no upper limit on age. So we lived in California 
pretty long. Well, we live in Carmel. You know

11:13.746 --> 11:14.447
where that is? Yes, of course. That's where I want 
to live someday. And I commuted over to Fresno, 150

11:18.713 --> 11:24.880
miles, on Monday, Monday morning, and came back. 
They gave me a good schedule over there. I'd go

11:27.684 --> 11:30.908
there Monday morning and came back Thursday 
afternoon. Well, you lived in heaven if you were in

11:32.750 --> 11:37.956
Carmel because that's one of the most beautiful 
places. But the difference is Californians are a

11:38.217 --> 11:42.422
different breed of people. The Texans. And we were 
used to Texans. So you came back? Yeah. That's

11:48.936 --> 11:50.478
great. Okay, now let me ask you something about 
those days and changes. Was there something that

11:53.983 --> 12:10.587
stands out in your mind as being, you know, other 
than the women being admitted into A&M, other

11:53.983 --> 12:10.587
things that might have had a great impact and 
changed the way things were done in that

11:53.983 --> 12:10.587
department or influenced its growth?

12:13.435 --> 12:27.354
We didn't have a girl or ladies in industrial arts 
or vocational industrial program immediately.

12:30.879 --> 12:38.750
But ultimately, as girls and women were 
permitted, we did begin to get students

12:30.879 --> 12:38.750
interested. Did that surprise you? No. We 
welcomed it. That

12:45.793 --> 12:53.781
was one of the great things that turned A&M around, 
the women coming here.

12:56.604 --> 13:05.234
A lot of people fought it for the state, but it's the 
best thing that ever happened to A&M.

13:06.315 --> 13:09.919
There was a tremendous growth, maybe it wasn't as 
noticeable then, but Did the growth that came

13:10.523 --> 13:20.918
about so quickly have any influence on your 
interaction with students, on your ability to

13:10.523 --> 13:20.918
counsel with students and so forth? No, we just had 
more students. That complicated it. Plus we had

13:27.367 --> 13:28.228
more students. But students are all alike. So you 
still had enough time, though, to work with them?

13:35.258 --> 13:36.139
Yeah, we made time. Because students was our 
business. Do you have a feel... Boone is one of

13:40.662 --> 13:43.225
them. Sir? Boone is one of them. Right. A feel for 
how the perceptions of outsiders, what kind of

13:46.029 --> 13:56.804
perceptions did they have for this, you know, 
Department of Industrial Education? How was it

13:56.884 --> 14:02.872
viewed across the state or even beyond that or 
within the university? What were people's

14:02.932 --> 14:07.418
perceptions of the department you have? Well, 
those interested in... of occupational oriented

14:11.948 --> 14:31.492
programs were very pleased, especially in the 
industrial arts and vocational education areas

14:11.948 --> 14:31.492
when A&M got into the advanced degree programs. We 
had a lot of people who wanted to come here that had

14:33.274 --> 14:40.723
gotten their undergraduate work other places to 
do their doctorate here. There was none in the

14:41.041 --> 14:43.966
state in our field. Was this the first one? Yes, 
ma'am. Did a lot of them come about as a result of

14:48.332 --> 14:51.217
that? Are there a lot of people now that offer that 
degree? Yes. North Texas, East Texas.

14:59.970 --> 15:05.819
I'm positive of those schools offering the 
advanced degree, doctoral degree. But it was A&M

15:06.340 --> 15:09.445
then that offered the first one in the state. The 
University of Texas offered a doctorate degree,

15:10.690 --> 15:16.379
but not in industrial education. People who had 
industrial arts and vocational industrial

15:17.041 --> 15:24.273
backgrounds could go there, but they got no more of 
their field.

15:27.458 --> 15:34.690
You tell me a little bit about some of the 
highlights, and you were here for 27 years. Some of

15:35.682 --> 15:54.178
the things that maybe stand out in your mind is 
having had a lot of significance or maybe personal

15:35.682 --> 15:54.178
gratification of things that happened other than 
establishing this doctoral program, which I'm

15:35.682 --> 15:54.178
sure was probably one of your great contributions 
along with other things. Well, we felt that the

15:54.198 --> 16:03.226
doctoral program being offered here in all fields 
was very beneficial to Texas A&M University. And

16:03.947 --> 16:05.588
as a result, I think the people throughout the 
state had a much higher regard for A&M because they

16:05.939 --> 16:12.127
were doing that. In fact, we had to offer a 
doctorate degree for quite a few years before the

16:12.308 --> 16:27.588
normal

16:12.308 --> 16:27.588
state teachers colleges got into that.

16:28.269 --> 16:34.157
Any insights or observations or maybe some little 
anecdotes or something that happened that would

16:34.593 --> 16:50.688
not be in any documents that are just from your own 
personal experience, be someone or some

16:34.593 --> 16:50.688
individuals that might have either influenced 
you or you felt you had had influence on that went on

16:34.593 --> 16:50.688
to do. I think a difference that we noticed 
immediately was when we started offering the

16:50.708 --> 17:02.338
advanced degrees was that we attracted people 
from other states throughout the United States,

17:03.618 --> 17:17.934
which benefited our program as well as the 
university because they got a good impression of

17:03.618 --> 17:17.934
Texas A&M. They used to think of it as an all-male 
Hick school.

17:25.502 --> 17:30.908
And of course, we were glad to get additional 
exposure for our own department. Because not many

17:31.377 --> 17:35.220
in the United States had doctoral programs in our 
field. In fact, I think we were about the third.

17:39.964 --> 17:49.032
Penn State and the University of Missouri, I 
think, were the only two that had doctoral

17:39.964 --> 17:49.032
programs in our field.

17:49.052 --> 18:00.962
It took a long time to get people, general people, 
citizens, oriented to the idea that we were not

17:49.052 --> 18:00.962
shop people, per se. But there were a lot of facets 
in the educational program that they could get in

18:02.782 --> 18:15.359
no way other than to go to get advanced degrees.

18:15.379 --> 18:21.808
Do you have a feel for where that area is now, or how 
it has evolved? What is going on in the schools now

18:23.511 --> 18:28.598
that relates to these beginnings? I think because 
of the advanced degree, And the status that it put,

18:31.857 --> 18:48.799
industrial education, vocational education, 
gave us a much higher recognition in the public

18:31.857 --> 18:48.799
schools by the administrators. They used to think 
we were all wood butchers.

18:57.531 --> 19:01.476
I think A&M led the pack. in doing this thing, 
because I taught at East Texas before I came here.

19:07.385 --> 19:12.293
And our idea at East Texas was A&M is a cow college. 
When I got here, I saw little cows.

19:18.862 --> 19:19.323
Okay. Well, as the administrators began to change 
their view of these teachers, what did that do to

19:30.599 --> 19:37.327
people wanting to come into education when it 
became, you know, a college of education and to go

19:30.599 --> 19:37.327
out there and be able to teach. Are you thinking 
about our field? Mm-hmm. In industrial. I think it

19:40.732 --> 19:53.467
gave our field a good recognition and an upgrading 
of the status of industrial education by

19:40.732 --> 19:53.467
everyone.

19:56.231 --> 19:57.973
Now industrial education that is offered in the 
schools for students? Is it for students that just

20:02.783 --> 20:09.493
want to be able to get a skill to go out to work rather 
than continue with their education? What is the

20:09.993 --> 20:11.015
thrust? Well, first, I think it almost has to be 
pointed out, is the industrial education being

20:11.816 --> 20:28.821
offered in the public schools under the 
jurisdiction of federal Smith Hughes and what is

20:11.816 --> 20:28.821
it? Barton Act? Vocational acts. National 
vocational acts.

20:41.569 --> 20:48.776
Because if they graduate under that, the 
assumption is those teachers will train high

20:41.569 --> 20:48.776
school kids to go to industry. That's not always 
true. If they graduated from a program that was

20:53.460 --> 20:58.285
both general educational as well as vocational, 
then the hope was that the youngsters in high

20:58.838 --> 21:14.859
school would have a better appreciation of 
industry and people that work in industry as they

20:58.838 --> 21:14.859
would in agriculture. I haven't seen the funny 
papers yet. You must get them. That's all I ever

21:19.865 --> 21:22.108
read was the funny papers. That's probably the 
best part. It keeps me happy. So then, how is that

21:28.370 --> 21:32.935
handled in the schools now? Are they still very 
separate? You know, the vocational programs

21:35.317 --> 21:41.944
still totally separate from the regular general 
education, do you know? In the high schools?

21:42.985 --> 21:43.125
Mm-hmm. Well, observation of it is that if you have 
a teacher who is qualified for vocational

21:44.747 --> 21:57.600
certification, it means that the high school can 
get federal monies. for the teacher. And in turn,

22:00.402 --> 22:14.280
they would then expect those teachers to 
intensify entry in the industry when they get out

22:00.402 --> 22:14.280
of high school, or before they get out of high 
school. Was there always very strong federal

22:14.300 --> 22:19.026
support for all these programs when you were 
involved in it? A lot of federal funding and state

22:19.046 --> 22:22.231
funding as well? Yeah, states had to match 
federal.

22:27.097 --> 22:27.958
Is that still true? I presume it is. I haven't been 
in the racket so long.

22:36.621 --> 22:52.404
You probably are familiar with a lot of the current 
reforms in education and what parole is trying to

22:36.621 --> 22:52.404
do and what a lot of people are saying about the 
vocational and these changes, for example, now

22:36.621 --> 22:52.404
the core curriculum coming in at A&M and everybody 
has to take all these particular courses. What is

22:52.424 --> 22:57.692
your reaction to that, to those kinds of reforms? 
We haven't seen enough of it yet to know how

22:59.714 --> 23:05.803
effective it is in the long run.

23:10.891 --> 23:29.518
We have felt, going back a bit now, that those 
graduating in college in vocational type

23:10.891 --> 23:29.518
programs, industrial and vocational,

23:10.891 --> 23:29.518
have a better opportunity to get children in the 
secondary schools acquainted with industry and

23:30.815 --> 23:38.367
other occupational areas because they can't all 
go to college. And the trade and industrial and

23:40.570 --> 23:52.048
vocational homemaking and all of those, that is 
their purpose generally, to get high school kids

23:40.570 --> 23:52.048
ready to go to industry. They don't care whether 
they go to college or not. Or they don't, so I won't

23:55.272 --> 23:56.915
say that. But if they don't go, they've got a good 
background. Industrial arts is mostly

24:00.211 --> 24:07.122
sort of dual. We want them to get some appreciation 
of vocations, but we also want them to get an idea of

24:07.182 --> 24:14.693
what industry is all about.

24:17.798 --> 24:27.653
Do you feel like there is some kind of a thrust or 
movement to de-emphasize vocational or not to not

24:27.852 --> 24:33.678
give it, because it was in its heyday, say, back in 
the, what, 60s or 70s? And then it seemed like the

24:33.738 --> 24:38.002
pendulum has swung a little bit. Is it likely to go 
back, or where do you feel that is right now? Do you

24:43.047 --> 24:44.508
have a feel for that? Well, I don't have a real feel 
for it, probably because I'm too deeply involved

24:45.189 --> 24:51.115
in it, always have been. I think there's... a 
feeling by some high school administrators that

24:56.017 --> 25:04.366
they want the kids to go to college. And they don't 
want them to stop when they get out of high school.

25:09.791 --> 25:16.778
Probably the more liberal thinking nowadays is 
that they need to have a choice.

25:20.342 --> 25:23.425
And a good background in vocational and in 
industrial To me, it's good for everybody.

25:27.470 --> 25:29.052
Probably because I'm involved. Well, it's fine. I 
had one person tell me... They can go overboard,

25:33.620 --> 25:34.561
too. Somebody told me, though, that back in the old 
days, we're talking about the 50s probably, this

25:35.823 --> 25:43.476
particular person had chosen the vocational. 
Then he changed his mind and wanted to go to college

25:43.496 --> 25:48.484
and was punished, was even thrown out of school. 
you know, for wanting to go to college. And he felt

25:51.042 --> 26:07.404
very strongly about what you're saying, that you 
should have a choice, but just because you choose

25:51.042 --> 26:07.404
when you maybe start going into high school that 
you want to go to the vocational route, if halfway

25:51.042 --> 26:07.404
down the road you decide maybe you would like to go 
to college, that you still should have that

25:51.042 --> 26:07.404
option. Does it track students into something 
where then they can't get out? I think the programs

26:12.451 --> 26:18.960
ought to be built so the teachers don't try to 
influence them. Against the kids' will. Now,

26:23.453 --> 26:30.182
parents may be of such financial status that they 
can't send their children to college.

26:33.246 --> 26:38.453
But by the same token, they don't want them to be 
wood butchers. I mean, there was. I don't think

26:40.596 --> 26:48.987
it's much anymore, because the people that felt 
that are much older now. Shut up. The younger ones

26:50.564 --> 27:15.238
who are getting into that classification, I 
think, can understand that

26:50.564 --> 27:15.238
occupational orientation

26:50.564 --> 27:15.238
via information or experiences are good for 
everybody and do not curtail them.

27:18.475 --> 27:28.150
In closing, is there anything that you would like 
to summarize

27:18.475 --> 27:28.150
your career in this field? Obviously, you love it 
and you feel very strongly about it. Is there

27:31.075 --> 27:41.912
something that you would like to close with that 
has influenced you or you have influenced? I don't

27:41.932 --> 27:42.452
know. I've influenced everybody, actually.

27:48.412 --> 28:02.671
Ten years ago I would have said that we have to keep 
people from saying derogatory comments about

27:48.412 --> 28:02.671
occupational educational type programs. On a 
college level or any level? Anywhere. Okay. I

28:08.799 --> 28:15.988
think today it is a well accepted fact that it might 
have been a good idea for all

28:18.584 --> 28:28.495
students to have had some experiences of that type 
because they are as valuable as other courses they

28:18.584 --> 28:28.495
take. A lot of this, you know, has been generated 
through superintendents, pro and con. Some of

28:35.422 --> 28:38.045
them think we all ought to have a lot of it. Other 
superintendents say we're going to have no

28:38.686 --> 28:43.391
vocational programs. We don't want our students 
influenced that way. We want them to come up

28:46.114 --> 28:47.916
culturally. You know, I've run into that. Not 
anymore, but I have run into that. When I go on, or

28:55.636 --> 29:11.813
more when I was at East Texas, I'd be invited to talk 
to various groups, the Waters Alliance, or the

28:55.636 --> 29:11.813
industrial educational oriented groups.

29:13.876 --> 29:15.237
And it was kind of hard to get them to understand 
that. Now, people, I don't think, think

29:18.266 --> 29:28.635
begrudgingly against occupational type courses 
in public schools anymore. How do you think that

29:28.655 --> 29:31.978
would affect the dropout? You know, there's such a 
scary thing right now about dropouts and

29:31.998 --> 29:39.025
potential, you know, the at-risk student, that's 
all you're hearing about right now. Do you feel

29:39.985 --> 29:46.371
that this could have an impact if it was emphasized 
more on keeping students in school, possibly?

29:46.891 --> 29:52.920
Probably if they could earmark the kids that are 
going that way, that need to go that way. I think

29:55.244 --> 29:59.551
probably one thing that has helped us more than 
anything is guidance counselors now. We didn't

30:00.472 --> 30:01.594
used to have them.

30:04.639 --> 30:04.959
In what way? Just by being able to lead the students 
into? Yeah, by not being narrow-minded, but

30:09.006 --> 30:13.793
having broad concepts of Occupational 
opportunities. I don't mean industry. I mean all

30:17.577 --> 30:19.640
occupational opportunities. Career education 
is what I'm trying to say. It's called career

30:24.948 --> 30:26.430
education now. I don't know if that's a more 
acceptable term or not. It depends on who we are. To

30:33.521 --> 30:34.783
me, it doesn't matter. But some of you said, oh, I 
want my boy to go to vocational school. No, I don't

30:39.349 --> 30:41.873
want him to go be a wood butcher or carpenter. But if 
you can talk to them about careers, then that's

30:42.967 --> 30:46.051
something different. That's right. I run into 
that. Well, Dr. Gronemann, I really appreciate

30:50.957 --> 30:54.642
your taking this time to visit with me. It's been 
very enlightening, and I appreciate your time. I

30:58.046 --> 31:07.498
appreciate what you did to get these things for 
A&M, because people like you have had so much

30:58.046 --> 31:07.498
influence on making A&M what it is today. I've 
enjoyed my stay here. It's gone fast. Glad to have

31:11.569 --> 31:12.660
you. Since 1940.
