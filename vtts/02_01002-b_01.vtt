00:01.516 --> 00:14.447
Do you think the bombing raids and the bombing 
campaign at LBJ placed into effect was as

00:01.516 --> 00:14.447
effective as Nixon's role?

00:14.467 --> 00:16.729
I think to an extent it was. I think any time you can 
hit a military target and you can cause any kind of

00:16.749 --> 00:30.021
reaction from the military, whether... You know, 
the ideal situation in any war is to wound

00:16.749 --> 00:30.021
everybody, not kill them. because it takes three 
or four people to take care of every wounded guy. So

00:34.997 --> 00:38.783
that way you just, you know, if they don't take care 
of their wounded, then they die. So then it's their

00:39.184 --> 00:41.367
fault and you put the monkey on their back. So it's 
better to, you know, if you really want to overcome

00:41.427 --> 00:47.477
them quick, wound everybody and don't kill 
anybody. Then they've got to take care of each

00:47.517 --> 00:48.799
other. The thing about the bombing is that picture 
an American ship, a civilian ship, unloading

01:00.173 --> 01:18.552
military cargo in Bremenhaven, and the Germans 
are fighting the Russians, and nobody else is

01:00.173 --> 01:18.552
involved, do you think that the Russians will 
leave that ship alone, or will they try to sink it in

01:00.173 --> 01:18.552
Bremenhaven? Now, that brings to mind that there 
were Russian, Cuban, Liberian shipping that got

01:19.292 --> 01:26.940
through all the minefields and stuff, and got into 
the harbor in Hanoi, and they unloaded military

01:27.393 --> 01:33.240
goods, why weren't they all considered targets? 
Why weren't they sunk in the harbors? To me, that's

01:37.586 --> 01:39.889
one of the best military targets in the world. And 
we would not even fire at those ships, because

01:40.289 --> 01:48.840
politically, we didn't want to cut our throats 
around the world and hurt anybody's feelings.

01:49.761 --> 01:51.764
That's the problem with the American people. You 
know, we're already considered ugly Americans.

01:56.587 --> 02:09.568
So when you do something,

01:56.587 --> 02:09.568
you know, and I'm losing track of where I want to go, 
but the thing that I want to say is that you've got to

01:56.587 --> 02:09.568
fight fire with fire. Otherwise, the biggest guy 
on the block is going to rule, and he may be the

02:09.588 --> 02:23.050
dumbest sucker in the world, and he may be sadistic 
and everything else, but if you don't take out this

02:09.588 --> 02:23.050
guy, then he's going to run the block, and he's 
going to run your family, and he's going to dictate

02:23.401 --> 02:29.330
what you can do in your home. And that's the way I 
look at countries. If everybody doesn't have to

02:32.635 --> 02:37.282
agree with America, I don't expect them to. It 
would be a screwed-up world if they did. And

02:41.448 --> 02:45.915
America's not always right in our policies, and 
I'll be the first one to say that. But basically,

02:47.043 --> 02:56.865
around the world, with the rights that we have for 
people in our own country, and we try to get those

02:47.043 --> 02:56.865
rights into other country systems. And unless you 
get out of the country and see what some of these

02:59.370 --> 03:04.782
other countries look like, you won't understand 
what I'm talking about. But you've got to go around

03:06.314 --> 03:12.301
and see what happens in other countries before you 
can start talking about the United States. The

03:12.882 --> 03:20.951
United States, as bad as it may be for some people, 
is still the best country in the world to live in. It

03:20.971 --> 03:21.572
really is. And I've been to France and Europe and 
all over Southeast Asia, and I'm telling you now,

03:30.412 --> 03:33.637
that the United States is the best country in the 
world to live in. You don't go home at night after 6

03:34.117 --> 03:38.884
o'clock and shut all your lights out and crawl into 
a bunker under your kitchen. A lot of people still

03:40.486 --> 03:44.532
do that in Southeast Asia because they're still 
fighting over there. You don't have to worry about

03:45.573 --> 03:48.678
terrorism that much right now in the United 
States. They worry about it all over Europe.

03:57.884 --> 04:04.772
How do you feel about those who protested, but 
protested by leaving the country and going to

03:57.884 --> 04:04.772
Canada and coming back?

04:07.775 --> 04:12.521
There were a lot of ways to protest the actions in 
South Vietnam. You could have legally stayed in

04:12.541 --> 04:17.606
this country and rested yourself as a 
conscientious objector. And you could have

04:18.768 --> 04:19.949
stayed right here. And then you would have had to 
face your peer group and the relations next door

04:24.023 --> 04:30.269
that had sons and daughters in South Vietnam. They 
copped out then, and they're going to cop out again

04:30.289 --> 04:34.814
whenever it happens. They're never going to be 
able to face a major decision in their life. I don't

04:38.597 --> 04:41.600
think they should have been allowed to come back to 
this country. I think they're all a bunch of

04:42.561 --> 04:44.683
cowards. And I'm not saying just because they 
didn't go fight in South Vietnam. I'm saying that

04:49.228 --> 04:51.330
they'll never stand up for the Declaration of 
Independence. They'll never stand up for the flag

04:53.795 --> 04:56.677
of this country. They wouldn't do it then, and they 
never will. I wouldn't care if you declared a World

04:59.039 --> 05:02.042
War III. These kind of people you're going to have 
all the time, regardless. It don't make any

05:08.208 --> 05:09.729
difference. You're going to have a certain few 
that are going to run away from everything. We've

05:14.073 --> 05:19.798
got to remember also that this is not the first time 
that people have ran off and going to Canada. They

05:21.843 --> 05:23.165
did it during the Korean War. They got amnesty when 
they came back then.

05:31.057 --> 05:34.562
And I wish they all had to wear a sign or they had a 
tattoo on their forehead. I ran away. I wasn't

05:36.244 --> 05:37.766
there, okay? There was other ways to serve your 
country. You could have joined the National

05:41.151 --> 05:42.453
Guard. You could have joined the Reserves. You 
could have went to Europe.

05:47.821 --> 05:50.325
You could have been a medic or a doctor or a nurse. 
You didn't have to really participate in the

05:50.963 --> 05:53.306
fighting. Okay? There was just other ways to do it 
and still remain an American. As far as I'm

06:00.955 --> 06:03.398
concerned, they all should have lost their 
citizenship. And they should be still living in

06:04.560 --> 06:12.970
Canada where they were freezing their tails off 
instead of coming back here after they got their

06:04.560 --> 06:12.970
good educations and stuff and getting good jobs. I 
don't have any sympathy for them. And I don't want

06:17.525 --> 06:25.796
to meet them, don't want to shake their hands, and 
don't want to talk to them, and certainly don't

06:17.525 --> 06:25.796
even want to be in the same room with them. Well, how 
do you feel about those who were conscientious

06:25.816 --> 06:34.147
objectors, but they burned their draft cards and 
protested on campuses and stuff like that? Do you

06:35.248 --> 06:37.531
have the same attitude towards them?

06:41.136 --> 06:44.480
Well, you know, burning your draft card doesn't 
prevent you from getting drafted. That's true.

06:47.275 --> 07:14.228
And

06:47.275 --> 07:14.228
for the ones that seriously knew what they were 
doing and stood up and made a stand in front of

06:47.275 --> 07:14.228
everybody here at home, you know, and faced that 
here at home, I can accept that a lot more than I can

06:47.275 --> 07:14.228
them going away from Camden just out of sight, out 
of mind, and then after it's all over coming back.

07:16.081 --> 07:19.485
There were a lot of guys that went to South Vietnam 
that didn't want to go. There were a lot of guys

07:20.847 --> 07:30.738
that were kind and gentle and had no business being 
over there.

07:33.522 --> 07:36.906
There were a lot of them that just couldn't adapt, 
and a lot of them are still there. There was

07:38.548 --> 07:43.894
50-something thousand guys killed in South 
Vietnam, and I doubt if any one of them, wanted to

07:45.292 --> 07:47.575
bleed and die in a foreign country. You know, 
you're just not going to find the guy that's going

07:49.598 --> 07:57.569
to raise his hand and volunteer and say, hey, I'll 
bleed and die in South Vietnam. Now, they all went

07:57.589 --> 08:04.259
over and tried to do a service for their country 
that they thought was right. Because like I say,

08:05.701 --> 08:13.712
they wanted to fight communism there instead of 
Texas or Oklahoma or Louisiana or someplace like

08:05.701 --> 08:13.712
that. Okay, what you want to know is about

08:15.802 --> 08:22.330
guys going native. And I mentioned to you before 
that we had Marine contact teams that would go out

08:22.550 --> 08:33.163
into the villages during harvest and stuff like 
that and help the regional forces protect the

08:22.550 --> 08:33.163
village. And as far as that taking place, those 
were good ideas because... It was a show of force

08:44.438 --> 08:57.998
from the Americans for the Arvins, or for the South 
Vietnamese government, to help protect the

08:44.438 --> 08:57.998
villages while they harvested their crops and 
protect them from the V.C. so they could have a

08:58.038 --> 09:02.464
school or so that they could even have a church. And 
they could, if they wanted to, worship in that

09:03.777 --> 09:07.662
church. And it helped set up irrigation systems 
and build buildings and new schools and stuff like

09:09.164 --> 09:15.292
that. But as far as guys

09:16.493 --> 09:29.650
going completely native and wearing black 
pajamas and doing things like that, I was never in a

09:16.493 --> 09:29.650
position to see things like that. I know that... If 
you were in a...

09:37.592 --> 09:38.513
I just never saw that. I guess guys back in the big 
firebases and stuff like that would wear black

09:39.675 --> 09:50.191
pajamas around in the evening because they were 
comfortable and you didn't have to wear your

09:39.675 --> 09:50.191
uniform 24 hours a day. I wasn't in a position to see 
that. I had my uniform on 24 hours a day. And if that

09:55.319 --> 10:00.126
was something that was happening, I don't think it 
was... I don't think it was very much of it. There

10:04.488 --> 10:17.846
was a lot of guys that would go into a village and 
live in a hooch, you know, five or six guys, and

10:04.488 --> 10:17.846
these were the guys that stayed with that village 
for maybe two or three weeks, and then they'd leave

10:04.488 --> 10:17.846
and another five guys would come in. And this was 
just during harvest times and stuff like that to

10:18.607 --> 10:26.417
really help them get set up and have their own 
defensive system as far as the... what they call

10:26.954 --> 10:32.021
the rough puffs or the popular forces were 
concerned, teach them just so much stuff. But most

10:32.042 --> 10:37.329
of that kind of stuff was done by advisors until you 
got way out in the woods someplace. And if there was

10:37.930 --> 10:45.642
a local fire base or something like that and they 
had asked for help, then we'd send four or five guys

10:37.930 --> 10:45.642
out for a while. But to go completely native was a 
dangerous thing to do because if you partied with

10:45.662 --> 10:56.117
them, familiarity breeds contempt. Now that's a 
wide statement, but for a military man, that's so

10:57.582 --> 11:05.753
much more true than for anybody else, I think. In 
ranks and out of ranks. They were sent out there to

11:09.358 --> 11:17.228
do a job, and if they became that familiar and 
started dressing like the people and acting like

11:09.358 --> 11:17.228
the people... then they were no longer part of the 
U.S. military forces. They were just one of the

11:20.642 --> 11:24.907
guys, and they were there to be part of the military 
forces. Does that answer your question about

11:25.828 --> 11:27.390
going native? Yes, sir. In your statement about 
what you just said about going into the villages

11:31.614 --> 11:38.842
and mostly there was advisors, was this a type of 
pacification program? Well, every military

11:38.862 --> 11:42.045
district had military advisors. There were so 
many ARVN units in these districts. So each Arvin

11:46.553 --> 11:50.557
unit had a military advisor, a U.S. military 
advisor. I think it only went down to battalion

11:51.118 --> 11:53.521
level. I'm not sure because I was never in an 
advisory group. But I know that most Arvin units in

11:58.246 --> 12:04.352
South Vietnam, whether it was a straight-legged 
unit, ranger, airborne, it didn't make any

11:58.246 --> 12:04.352
difference. Armin Cav, they had guys that 
specialized. Like if it was an Armin Cav unit, then

12:09.117 --> 12:15.244
they had Armin Cav sergeants and officers, 
American officers and enlisted men that were

12:15.646 --> 12:21.535
advisors for that armored

12:15.646 --> 12:21.535
unit. During LBJ's term, what did you see or do you 
think that the Gulf of Tonkin incident allowed him

12:23.898 --> 12:34.433
to escalate without asking Congress to declare 
war?

12:38.099 --> 12:39.380
Frankly, I didn't see anything. You know, if 
you've been shot at a few times, A couple little old

12:43.253 --> 12:48.258
gunboats coming out and taking on a destroyer or 
frigate is pretty damn stupid. And for us to

12:49.098 --> 12:57.586
escalate in South Vietnam because a U.S. ship was 
fired on by a PT boat, give me a break. You know, it's

12:57.606 --> 13:03.151
like shooting at a guy armed with an automatic 
weapon with a .22 pistol. It's pretty stupid. It

13:04.853 --> 13:05.754
was an excuse. A real flimsy excuse. But if that's 
what they wanted it for, it got the job done. How did

13:16.633 --> 13:22.659
you see McCarthyism and the Red Scare affect 
Vietnam?

13:25.782 --> 13:27.423
Well, I've got to go back to...

13:31.828 --> 13:39.855
The thing that you're trained for in the military 
nowadays is not so much the Russians, but it's...

13:40.814 --> 13:52.846
It's basic doctrine, and it's geared towards 
terrorism, counterinsurgency, and I guess if you

13:40.814 --> 13:52.846
had to, you could say that if we're ever going to 
fight anybody, you always pick the guy that you

13:40.814 --> 13:52.846
train for. All your training is geared towards the 
guy that you think one of these days you're going to

13:52.906 --> 13:57.630
fight. For us, after the Germans, there was nobody 
left around to really pick on the United States

13:58.551 --> 14:06.619
except Russia. They were big enough and armed well 
enough to harass us or pick on us, if you want to say

14:07.392 --> 14:14.422
that. I know for a fact that in talking to some of my 
German friends that right after the war was over,

14:15.204 --> 14:22.494
they all buried their weapons. They didn't turn 
them in. They buried them with ammunition and

14:24.377 --> 14:36.555
everything because they just knew that the United 
States was going to ask them to help fight the

14:24.377 --> 14:36.555
Russians.

14:36.974 --> 14:40.004
And I ask him why, and he says, well, everybody 
knows the Russians are bad people. You know? And

14:42.433 --> 14:42.874
are they? I've only met two in my life, and they were 
officers, and...

14:51.284 --> 14:52.446
Never said much to them. I was a master sergeant, 
and they were a colonel and a line general. So what

14:57.993 --> 14:58.994
am I going to say? And I would think that the Russian 
people are basically like the American people.

15:05.383 --> 15:06.524
They want to be happy. They want to eat food. They 
want to have clothes and shelter. And they want to

15:11.070 --> 15:14.655
be left alone to enjoy their lives. So who am I to say 
that the Russians are bad? I've never met any. But

15:20.444 --> 15:25.491
the military trains us for 20 years. They train me 
to fight the Russians because those are the guys

15:25.531 --> 15:33.202
that can cause the most problems for us. And I'm not 
saying that we'll ever fight the Russians, but we

15:34.303 --> 15:43.796
prepare for what we consider to be the worst.

15:47.922 --> 15:49.624
That's the way the military training goes. But I 
don't think we'll ever fight Russia. I don't think

15:54.081 --> 15:56.026
we'll be stupid enough to fight Russia. And I 
certainly don't think Russia is stupid enough to

15:56.066 --> 15:58.733
fight us. I really don't. There may be some 
isolated incidents you know, small fire fights or

16:04.319 --> 16:09.687
stuff like the Russians and the Chinese have got 
going along their borders right now. I just don't

16:10.508 --> 16:15.436
see the United States getting involved in a major 
war with a major country. I see us trying to do

16:16.117 --> 16:23.828
things in Nicaragua, in South America, to protect 
our own fronts. You know, where are we going with

16:24.709 --> 16:28.195
all this stuff? If we fight anything else but a 
conventional war, everybody's a loser. It

16:34.289 --> 16:36.272
doesn't make any difference whose side you're on. 
If it doesn't stay conventional and some idiot

16:36.792 --> 16:46.546
like Gaddafi gets an atomic weapon and pushes the 
button, everybody loses.

16:50.171 --> 16:57.681
Do you see in Nicaragua

16:50.171 --> 16:57.681
right now any correlations between Vietnam Do you 
see us, with our advisors, as it started out in

16:58.403 --> 17:04.650
Vietnam, do you see us maybe escalating? Or do you 
think, due to the Russians' involvement in

17:05.871 --> 17:14.982
Afghanistan and such a problem they're having, 
that nothing will ever come of it, that they'll get

17:05.871 --> 17:14.982
tired of fighting eventually? I think the most 
that we'll ever do in South America, if the

17:16.243 --> 17:23.331
situation doesn't change in South America... One 
of these days, because it's so close to us, the

17:24.273 --> 17:31.966
United States is going to have a major problem in 
South America. And this may cause some hairs to be

17:31.986 --> 17:45.910
raised in your class, but if we don't influence the 
situations on borders that are directly related

17:31.986 --> 17:45.910
to our own country, then you're going to have a 
problem. The relationship between us and Canada

17:48.574 --> 17:52.540
is leveling out. There's more give and take now, 
and there will be between now and 1992. Tariffs

17:57.567 --> 18:00.872
will be lifted. Free enterprise is going to take 
over. But the people in South America can't relate

18:04.337 --> 18:07.801
to that. All they're trying to do is just find 
enough food so they can live one more day. And until

18:13.805 --> 18:22.198
you can make situations better for people like 
that, then you're going to have a problem, because

18:13.805 --> 18:22.198
they don't care if they live or die. And if they can 
die for a cause that they never had before, hey,

18:23.620 --> 18:28.728
that's great. And I think the ideal for South 
America is special forces. And

18:37.392 --> 18:44.903
guerrilla-trained units, you're not going to be 
able to go in there with conventional units,

18:37.392 --> 18:44.903
except get a lot of people killed. You're going to 
have to go down there and fight those people the

18:45.604 --> 18:53.075
same way that they fight. And I don't think...

18:54.877 --> 18:59.844
And the only way to do that is with money. You're 
going to have to pour money after money after money

18:59.864 --> 19:02.488
into the country. But you've got to be there to see 
how the money's spent. and you've got to control it

19:07.514 --> 19:12.920
until they're capable of controlling it 
themselves. And I don't see anybody down there

19:13.681 --> 19:16.744
right now that's capable of controlling it. 
They're doing it with force and arms, and they're

19:17.645 --> 19:26.494
doing it with Russian weapons and communist bloc 
advisors. So why are they there? Why did we allow

19:30.939 --> 19:34.483
missiles for so long into Cuba? Why do we even allow 
Fidel Castro to exist? Is he not a threat to the

19:40.443 --> 19:47.073
United States in the way that we live, in the things 
that we have? You don't think for a minute if he

19:48.175 --> 19:52.622
could get away with it that he wouldn't come up here 
and take everything that we had? So where do you

19:52.662 --> 19:58.871
stop these people and people like him? Or do you 
just turn the other cheek? and let them to continue

20:04.957 --> 20:15.073
to exist and get stronger and stronger and 
stronger until you have to do something with your

20:04.957 --> 20:15.073
military service. I don't have all the answers. A 
lot of people say that it's very simple to put on a

20:17.718 --> 20:21.223
uniform and just obey your orders. It's not. 
Because the higher you go in the military

20:23.587 --> 20:27.774
structure, the more difficult your life becomes. 
Because now you're making decisions for

20:28.976 --> 20:31.740
everybody else below you. And sometimes that's 
not easy.

20:40.319 --> 20:52.276
But I think special forces, ranger-type units can 
go into South America, and it's not all going to be

20:40.319 --> 20:52.276
done at a conference table, okay? But if you can 
exert enough pressure against the opposing

20:52.796 --> 21:01.609
forces where they have to sit down and talk to you, 
as an equal. And it's leveled out enough to where

21:03.305 --> 21:08.871
they can't say one thing and you've got to do it 
because they can overpower you. It all has to be

21:09.773 --> 21:11.194
equal. And you've got to force them to the table. 
You don't have to force your way of life on them, but

21:15.960 --> 21:27.394
you have to make it where the people can make a 
decision and not just two or three hundred of those

21:15.960 --> 21:27.394
people because they've got the guns. You've got to 
take the guns away from them so everybody's equal

21:28.640 --> 21:33.706
and they can all make a decision. And if the country 
has an election and it's not rigged or anything,

21:33.806 --> 21:40.934
and that's what the people want, then get the hell 
out of it and let them have it. Unless it's so close

21:42.636 --> 21:45.339
to you that it's going to hurt your own boards. I'm 
rambling. In 1957, had, in 56, excuse me, had

21:55.353 --> 22:01.901
Vietnam and allowed to hold the elections and they 
had elected Ho Chi Minh, should we have backed out

21:55.353 --> 22:01.901
then? I think so.

22:09.851 --> 22:21.146
I don't know of anybody, enemy or foe, that did not 
hold Ho Chi Minh in high regard. I think any time

22:24.918 --> 22:36.471
you take a man of the people and he rises to such 
heights, then you've got to respect this

22:24.918 --> 22:36.471
individual for what he's done and what he's done 
for his country. The greatest thing that could

22:38.873 --> 22:47.803
have happened was that Ho Chi Minh in 1957 could 
have been elected by the people, all the people.

22:48.931 --> 22:49.412
Okay? And then we could have laid down our weapons, 
and we couldn't have invaded Cambodia or Laos or

22:50.433 --> 22:57.424
anything else like that. They could have had a 
protectionary force to guard their borders, and

22:57.444 --> 23:12.487
they could have started dealing and wheeling with 
everybody else in the world, you know, exporting

22:57.444 --> 23:12.487
their rice and coconuts and whatever else it is 
that they had to export and get people in. You know,

23:13.028 --> 23:17.014
one of the greatest resort areas in the world would 
be the China Beach in South Vietnam. It would make

23:21.161 --> 23:25.448
Acapulco and Miami look sick. The water's green, 
emerald green. The beaches were white-sanded.

23:32.679 --> 23:33.861
The weather was terrific. And if you didn't want to 
lay on the beach and get a suntan, you could hunt

23:34.983 --> 23:39.170
tigers up in the mountains. But South Vietnam is a 
beautiful country, and they have a lot to offer

23:40.933 --> 23:45.600
people.

23:49.445 --> 23:52.309
I thought the country was beautiful. But I think 
there's a lot of times you got to stand back and you

23:52.329 --> 23:59.218
got to let things happen.

24:02.242 --> 24:17.203
I think if they would have had an opportunity to be 
free for a while and not have anybody's thumb

24:02.242 --> 24:17.203
pressed on them like the French, then they would 
have had an opportunity to do something. Why do you

24:17.303 --> 24:18.945
think the elections were not held? Why do you think 
the Geneva Accord was not followed? Because I

24:23.507 --> 24:27.911
don't think everybody got the word to all the 
people in South Vietnam and North Vietnam. I think

24:29.772 --> 24:49.371
they reached the major educated people in the 
cities, but I don't think there was a real

24:29.772 --> 24:49.371
continuous effort to get out there in the villages 
where all the work was being done and the food was

24:29.772 --> 24:49.371
being raised to talk to that villager to get them in 
to vote So everyone had an opportunity. It's not

24:53.303 --> 24:54.685
like the United States. There wasn't any radio and 
TV and millions of dollars spent on, hey, I'm the

24:56.108 --> 25:07.746
best guy, and this guy's going to do this to you, but 
I'll do this for you. Their elections aren't like

25:08.246 --> 25:09.508
that. And I don't think there was a major effort to 
get all the people involved. And I think that's the

25:17.120 --> 25:19.003
same way in South America.

25:21.869 --> 25:27.216
As far as I know, we're probably one of the very few 
countries that do that. Look at France. Look what

25:30.060 --> 25:31.562
de Gaulle did in France.

25:34.186 --> 25:35.508
Look what Hitler did in Germany. Most of the German 
people at that time thought Hitler was a god. And

25:42.798 --> 25:44.400
there's a lot of them that still do.

25:47.772 --> 26:07.924
Do you think that maybe our allies, our commitment 
to our Western allies, such as Britain and France,

25:47.772 --> 26:07.924
helped not hold the elections because France 
wanted to come back in and have Vietnam as a colony?

26:10.992 --> 26:27.978
I think so, and I can understand why France wanted 
South Vietnam as a colony, because they had put so

26:10.992 --> 26:27.978
much money in it, they had all those plantations 
over there, there was a lot of rich people involved

26:10.992 --> 26:27.978
in those decisions that influenced what the 
government in France wanted. You know, let me ask

26:30.142 --> 26:36.592
you a question, okay?

26:36.612 --> 26:38.755
Who runs the United States? Is it the government, 
by the people, for the people? Or is it big

26:45.686 --> 26:46.888
business?

26:53.398 --> 26:54.921
I would say to an extent big business. So would I. 
And I think big business, regardless of what

26:57.064 --> 27:07.881
country you're in, certainly has an awful lot to do 
with how the government makes their decisions.

27:09.683 --> 27:13.828
And I think that that's real true right here in the 
United States.

27:19.335 --> 27:38.458
If we did what you suggested with the Rangers and 
the Special Forces, like Kennedy was doing in

27:19.335 --> 27:38.458
Vietnam and someone tried to escalate, do you 
think they would look back and study Vietnam and

27:19.335 --> 27:38.458
Korea and say, wait a minute, Wait a minute, do you 
think that we're that aware and enough study is

27:38.962 --> 27:49.438
being done about Vietnam to see the implications 
that it has?

27:53.645 --> 28:06.184
Julie, I think everybody has looked at Vietnam for 
so long, but I want to make a real quick comment

27:53.645 --> 28:06.184
here. The wheel revolves, okay? It's going to come 
around again. It may be South America. It may be

28:13.491 --> 28:14.813
back in Vietnam. It may be in Cambodia. But 
somebody

28:17.777 --> 28:27.812
is going to make a wrong decision, and they'll 
commit troops someplace where there really

28:17.777 --> 28:27.812
wasn't a need for it. If we would have stayed out of 
South Vietnam and went to Special Forces, do their

28:32.962 --> 29:02.867
jobs and just had advisors and special forces 
people there and fought the enemy the way they

28:32.962 --> 29:02.867
fought us and trained the South Vietnamese people 
were there wasn't any black market or the money was

28:32.962 --> 29:02.867
going to the right people instead of being used 
wrong you know then there would have been a

28:32.962 --> 29:02.867
ceasefire there would have been a South Vietnam 
and a North Vietnam they would have always argued

29:03.505 --> 29:06.227
Or maybe it could be all one South Vietnam right 
now. It could be a total Vietnam. But there would

29:08.249 --> 29:12.693
still be a Saigon, and there'd still be a Hanoi. But 
there would be one government. I don't know. And

29:20.600 --> 29:22.442
I'm not advocating special forces. But before you 
commit an army, you've got to recon the area. And

29:29.608 --> 29:31.470
the special forces... are trained to help people 
help themselves and to me if you're going to do

29:31.889 --> 30:00.647
anything that above all has to be done first and if 
special forces is the answer for that then commit

29:31.889 --> 30:00.647
to special forces and some advisors and then stop 
it and that way you're not over committed and if you

29:31.889 --> 30:00.647
decide later or your uh your congress decides 
later that we've made a mistake, then you haven't

30:02.416 --> 30:05.660
overcommitted. And you can pull those people out 
of there.

30:11.308 --> 30:11.608
Okay? Okay, you said a lot of people had studied 
Vietnam and looked at Vietnam. Do you think that

30:18.778 --> 30:22.923
shows through the movies that have come out, 
especially during this decade? And how do you feel

30:23.724 --> 30:26.888
about those movies and films that have come out? 
Well... My dad is

30:31.458 --> 30:40.251
a veteran of our country's uniforms. He spent 10 
years in the Marine Corps and he fought in the South

30:40.311 --> 30:45.238
Pacific for four and a half years until he was 
wounded. And then he spent the rest of the time in

30:46.580 --> 30:49.184
the Air Force.

30:52.148 --> 30:55.373
And he didn't watch any war movies. The first movie 
I saw about South Vietnam to include John Wayne's

30:57.580 --> 31:04.170
Green Beret movie was last year. I wouldn't watch 
war movies either. But I got so hung up about what

31:08.216 --> 31:20.635
the American people thought about GIs and what our 
actions were and how we could condone such

31:08.216 --> 31:20.635
savagery.

31:22.167 --> 31:49.440
that I went and got every one of these movies, 
Platoon, Hamburger Hill, The Boys in Company C,

31:22.167 --> 31:49.440
Green Berets, and out of all of them, I'd have to say 
that the one that I thought that best depicted,

31:22.167 --> 31:49.440
I'll get a lot of comments from this if everybody 
hears this tape, was the Green Berets.

31:52.778 --> 31:58.108
And it wasn't a big, could be because it had John 
Wayne in it, too. He's my favorite guy. Always has

31:59.550 --> 32:00.332
been. Nobody liked the Duke. But there was a lot of, 
you know, when you take a movie, like, let's take

32:02.716 --> 32:07.785
Platoon, for instance. Everybody says, well, 
that's, God, that's it. That's just the way the

32:10.510 --> 32:12.754
guys were in South Vietnam. Well, to an extent, it 
is.

32:17.095 --> 32:24.844
I spent two years in South Vietnam and fought with a 
lot of different units and not once did I see a group

32:17.095 --> 32:24.844
of guys rape a bunch of kids. Never, ever did I see 
that or hear of it.

32:37.438 --> 32:45.027
Shooting innocent villagers intentionally,

32:37.438 --> 32:45.027
I never saw. Maybe I was different. I certainly 
wasn't blind. I think I saw everything that could

32:49.917 --> 32:56.303
conceivably happen as far as warfare goes in those 
two years.

32:59.987 --> 33:09.336
But I've known a lot of sergeants that would have 
shot those men right there on the spot that was

32:59.987 --> 33:09.336
raping those little girls. I can give you three. 
B.J. Babbage, Sergeant Thompson, and Bob Mathis.

33:17.474 --> 33:18.215
We would have shot them. And then face the 
consequences for it later. One of the most savage

33:25.443 --> 33:30.048
people on earth is an American soldier. Given the 
certain surroundings and what's going on.

33:37.517 --> 33:39.118
You know, burning villages down.

33:43.443 --> 33:45.085
There was a lot of story in... The platoon story 
took about seven or major instances that took

33:46.567 --> 33:54.674
place in South Vietnam, and threw them all 
together, okay? And, well, for the weapons, for

33:55.715 --> 34:02.381
instance, the mini M16 that the sergeants 
carried. Oh, geez, give me a break. It didn't even

34:04.003 --> 34:12.991
hit the country until late 69, and the date on the 
movie was 67, along the Cambodian border with the

34:04.003 --> 34:12.991
25th Entry Division. Uh... I don't know. There was 
a lot of things in the movie that depicted the

34:18.468 --> 34:24.434
firefights. The ambush was

34:25.675 --> 34:31.001
good. The country was good. All those showed 
Vietnam.

34:41.132 --> 34:42.493
I just cannot see... The thing about the rape and 
shooting innocent civilians, I don't think that

34:43.790 --> 34:50.218
happened. And I think when people see, well, it 
happened, okay, with maybe two or three units, and

34:51.760 --> 35:02.012
it happened even with the unit that I was in, the 
11th Infantry Brigade.

35:05.356 --> 35:08.319
But you had one or two guys that just, they lost it. 
You know, they just lost control. But people see

35:13.118 --> 35:19.705
that on film, and they don't show all the instances 
leading up to it. And there were circumstances and

35:21.147 --> 35:28.995
situations that made those guys lose it. You know, 
Cali went from a 44-man platoon down to about 20

35:29.015 --> 35:37.284
guys in about three months due to booby traps and 
sniper fire and things like that. And they had been

35:38.465 --> 35:41.809
trying to get into my life, for months and couldn't 
do it because of the firepower that was still in

35:42.548 --> 35:47.655
there. And if they went in there to try to get the VC 
or the NVA out, at least they didn't set back

35:49.697 --> 36:02.093
offshore and hit it with naval gunfire or put a B-52 
strike on the village. You know? And that was

36:05.170 --> 36:06.511
somebody's answer. Let's do that. That way we 
won't get anybody hurt. Because every time we ever

36:09.674 --> 36:13.318
tried to go into my life, we got people hurt. Kelly 
knew that, and so did the guys that were with him.

36:16.882 --> 36:18.363
But they lost it for a few minutes. You know?

36:26.011 --> 36:27.353
I don't know. Movies are movies, Julie. There's 
not very much... about a war movie I mean you can say

36:34.186 --> 36:58.692
oh gee look at that and see how they did this and 
everything but the only guys or the only people

36:34.186 --> 36:58.692
that really appreciate those war movies are the 
guys that were there

36:34.186 --> 36:58.692
because they can relate to everything that 
happened in those movies or basically as far as the

36:34.186 --> 36:58.692
fighting is concerned And if you've never been 
there, then you can't relate to it. To you, it's

37:03.482 --> 37:04.483
just a movie. But for a lot of guys that wore 
uniforms, it's reliving an experience. And

37:10.194 --> 37:14.742
that's the difference.

37:14.762 --> 37:18.990
Civilians can walk out of those movies and say, 
boy, I'm glad I wasn't there. Gee, I'm glad that

37:19.330 --> 37:20.593
wasn't me. Oh, that's not true. And yeah, it is. And 
for military guys, all it does is bring back bad

37:25.655 --> 37:30.564
memories. Because nobody likes getting shot or 
being shot at.

37:39.560 --> 37:42.065
Even the police can attest to that.

37:47.194 --> 37:49.418
How do you see South Vietnam today? and what 
they're trying to do and the fact that they've

37:51.068 --> 38:03.408
opened it up and start let Americans come back to 
Vietnam and what's going on in Cambodia and Laos.

38:07.114 --> 38:08.637
Did you ever see the movie Killing Fields? Parts of 
it. If that film hadn't been shown in your class,

38:18.305 --> 38:20.928
That would be a good one to show everybody.

38:26.736 --> 38:30.000
I don't hold any grudges against the South 
Vietnamese or North Vietnamese people. One day

38:32.303 --> 38:42.256
I'd like to go back over there and just have the 
freedom to walk around some of the places that I've

38:32.303 --> 38:42.256
been and not worry about hitting a booby trap or 
getting shot. Because like I said before, it was a

38:43.557 --> 38:47.282
beautiful country.

38:49.709 --> 38:51.531
I'd go back for a visit. Certainly wouldn't want to 
go back over there and fight anymore. And I'd even

38:55.135 --> 39:01.663
like to sit down and talk to some of the guys that I 
fought against.

39:08.912 --> 39:13.237
Cambodia and Laos,

39:08.912 --> 39:13.237
I don't know. I'm glad that the South Vietnamese, 
or excuse me, I'm glad that the Vietnamese people

39:19.173 --> 39:22.340
are finally going to settle this thing as far as the 
MIAs are concerned. If they are, there's going to

39:22.560 --> 39:26.428
be some guys that you're never going to find. And 
that said, there's a lot of those people that don't

39:27.630 --> 39:33.001
want to be found. You notice there's a difference 
between POWs and MIAs.

39:40.098 --> 39:46.147
There were even several soldiers in some of the 
areas that I was in that fought for the North

39:40.098 --> 39:46.147
Vietnamese Army. And they were XGIs. They just 
went from one side to the other. And that's not

39:51.395 --> 39:53.238
uncommon. That happens in any war. Hey, I'm on the 
wrong side. Jump over to the other side.

40:03.873 --> 40:08.400
Unless Vietnam and these What are we going to call 
them? Undeveloped countries. Their culture goes

40:12.455 --> 40:16.901
back 2,000 years, but they're undeveloped, okay? 
I guess. Unless they can get out and participate in

40:19.945 --> 40:35.265
everything that's going on in this world and 
contribute to it and feed their people,

40:19.945 --> 40:35.265
then there's going to be another South Vietnam.

40:37.827 --> 40:38.748
And that would be sad. So where do you draw the line? 
Do you send them the money and start helping them,

40:40.872 --> 40:45.299
giving them loans? I don't have the answers for 
that kind of thing. But it would seem to me that it

40:49.705 --> 41:01.464
would be better to give them a loan than give them an 
infantry battalion.

41:01.484 --> 41:06.231
At least if you lose your money, you don't lose any 
lives. And I think that's the final answer, is not

41:06.953 --> 41:10.217
to lose any more lives. Because I, for one, would 
like to stay here and raise my kids and enjoy my

41:11.439 --> 41:16.145
family. And I don't think there's anybody else 
that doesn't want the same things.

41:24.096 --> 41:32.167
It's too bad you can't get everybody around the 
round table from all these countries and sit down

41:24.096 --> 41:32.167
and help each other out. That won't always work. 
It's not always the answer. Somebody's got to fire

41:37.055 --> 41:42.721
the first round and be an idiot. You know, they tell 
you that there's nothing that happens in this

41:42.741 --> 41:51.410
world that you can't discuss and sit down and work 
out. That may be true if that's what everybody

41:51.430 --> 41:54.654
wants to do. But there's always somebody that 
don't want to talk. They'd rather fight because

41:59.539 --> 42:01.581
that's easier. And they think that's a faster 
solution than talking. Okay, yeah, it took them a

42:08.732 --> 42:12.919
year and a half to figure out what kind of table they 
wanted at the Paris Peace Talks. What for? Who

42:15.884 --> 42:18.628
cares what kind of table it is as long as we sit down 
and start talking? Can you imagine how many guys

42:19.390 --> 42:24.919
died in a year and a half because them idiots 
couldn't figure out what kind of table they

42:19.390 --> 42:24.919
wanted?

42:29.742 --> 42:31.184
Nobody wins in a war. It's a sad situation.

42:36.411 --> 42:43.080
Is there one particular topic or one question or a 
few questions that you'd like to make comments

42:36.411 --> 42:43.080
about that I haven't asked you?

42:48.667 --> 42:57.859
I guess even after eight years of wearing a 
uniform, being away from the military eight years

42:48.667 --> 42:57.859
after doing 20 years in the military,

43:01.737 --> 43:10.589
I would like somebody like LBJ to sit down and 
explain to me why I was there.

43:13.554 --> 43:25.110
Now, I can

43:13.554 --> 43:25.110
basically defend why I was there myself, but I 
certainly don't have all the answers about

43:13.554 --> 43:25.110
Vietnam. And I've read a lot of books, and I've 
tried to find answers. I don't think anybody

43:30.998 --> 43:32.199
knows. I really don't.

43:37.606 --> 43:39.789
I think there was a lot of money made in Vietnam. I 
think it was

43:41.150 --> 43:47.938
bad for the country that Vietnam happened. I

43:47.958 --> 43:56.128
don't regret my service to my country. And I 
certainly don't regret wearing my uniform for 20

43:56.513 --> 44:05.040
years in the service of my country.

44:05.060 --> 44:15.549
And the two years that I did in South Vietnam, I did 
in an honorable, soldierly way. I did not condone

44:17.951 --> 44:23.636
or commit any war crimes. I tried to keep people 
alive. And I tried to do a job that I thought my

44:27.108 --> 44:31.713
country wanted done. And by my country, I mean my 
leaders.

44:36.258 --> 44:39.782
I'm not saying they were always right, but they 
were my leaders.

44:42.706 --> 44:44.227
So I did my duty. And I think that as long as you have 
men in uniform,

44:55.323 --> 44:58.207
They're there for the service of the country. And 
when you have men in uniform that rule the country,

45:00.229 --> 45:06.417
then that's wrong. So, if the soldiers were in 
South Vietnam, who's at fault? The government?

45:19.433 --> 45:21.195
Or the poor slob wearing the uniform?

45:26.896 --> 45:33.226
You know, there's a lot of military men that will 
tell you that it's really unfortunate that we

45:26.896 --> 45:33.226
didn't have our seven days of May.

45:38.254 --> 45:39.135
But it's our system. And we may not like it 
sometimes, but it's still the best one going. And

45:47.287 --> 45:52.195
until somebody comes up with the one better, I'll 
still fight for the one I got. And it may tick off

45:54.402 --> 45:58.389
some of the civilians and you may have guys run to 
Canada again. But if my country ever needs me

46:00.913 --> 46:03.638
again, I'll go. Because that's what my country 
needs. Not my needs, but what my wants are. But what

46:12.133 --> 46:13.134
the country needs. And if they need me, then I'll 
go. And I guess my brother would go and my father,

46:19.310 --> 46:26.558
he's 70 years old, and he would want to go too.

46:31.704 --> 46:48.502
And I just, you know, I'll make one last statement 
that this country would not be where it is today and

46:31.704 --> 46:48.502
would not even continue to exist as we know it if it 
wasn't for men like my brother and my father and

46:31.704 --> 46:48.502
myself. Veterans.

46:59.641 --> 47:00.062
Hello. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Well, 
used to people couldn't get me to talk about

47:05.388 --> 47:12.577
Vietnam or basically anything. I was here quiet, 
but now I have a tendency to ramble on. I guess that

47:17.323 --> 47:18.624
goes with the job. I have to do a lot of PR work where 
I'm at, so I'm used to talking now instead of doing

47:19.726 --> 47:26.374
it. I'm not sure which is better. I think I'd rather 
be out there doing
