WEBVTT

00:03.322 --> 00:08.349
Roger Staubach, trying to think, got a little football autograph for him.

00:10.532 --> 00:12.375
Lots of governors.

00:12.395 --> 00:14.218
Yeah, governors, yeah, yeah.

00:14.258 --> 00:19.806
Even mansions, governor's mansion, a time or two.

00:21.748 --> 00:25.033
Did you eat in any astonishing places?

00:25.053 --> 00:26.055
Yeah, sure did.

00:27.236 --> 00:30.561
It's kind of hard to come back to McDonald's.

00:31.823 --> 00:34.269
No, it's very, very astonishing places.

00:35.652 --> 00:36.674
You're honored.

00:36.694 --> 00:38.578
I mean, they're trying to wine and dine you in.

00:39.540 --> 00:47.478
Take some of the states you go to, like New Mexico or some of the smaller states, they really roll out the carpet for you.

00:47.939 --> 00:49.984
Not the larger ones don't.

00:49.964 --> 00:53.933
Governor of Virginia, got to talk with him.

00:54.153 --> 00:54.855
Pardon me, go ahead.

00:54.875 --> 00:55.075
Who?

00:55.496 --> 00:57.641
The Governor of Virginia.

00:58.062 --> 00:59.204
Lady Bird's son-in-law.

00:59.224 --> 01:00.146
Yeah, right.

01:00.206 --> 01:00.768
Rob.

01:00.788 --> 01:01.369
Rob.

01:01.469 --> 01:01.990
Chuck Robb.

01:02.030 --> 01:02.752
Yeah, Chuck Robb.

01:03.393 --> 01:04.376
And Alan, got to meet him.

01:04.436 --> 01:08.665
I was there twice, got to see Alan after that.

01:08.645 --> 01:21.260
As you went to all these places, did you get any feel for the national impression of veterinary medicine?

01:22.401 --> 01:22.782
What are they?

01:22.802 --> 01:29.830
I think nationally the people respect them, hold them with pretty high honor.

01:30.251 --> 01:35.597
They feel like they have got good integrity, you know, that they do the best they can.

01:36.337 --> 01:41.523
And what about their impression of Texas and of the veterinary medicine program in Texas?

01:41.583 --> 01:43.506
It's very good, very favorable, yeah.

01:43.526 --> 01:45.128
They always kid about the Aggies, of course.

01:45.168 --> 01:48.071
But like I said, regardless of where I go, there would always be an Aggie there.

01:48.972 --> 01:54.579
Whether it's Japan or France or Australia or any of the states, you run into Aggies everywhere.

01:54.599 --> 01:55.160
It's amazing.

01:55.420 --> 01:57.883
Quite often did somebody woke up showing you a ring?

01:58.264 --> 01:59.665
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:59.866 --> 02:00.346
It's amazing.

02:00.787 --> 02:00.987
All right.

02:01.007 --> 02:04.251
When that year was over, how did you feel?

02:04.231 --> 02:09.238
You feel like, gee, what happened?

02:09.258 --> 02:12.744
No, it, Martha and I have talked about it often.

02:12.764 --> 02:17.050
We really don't know how we did it because you're always, I was going 42 weekends that year.

02:17.871 --> 02:19.093
And she went with you most of the time?

02:19.113 --> 02:20.615
She went with me most, almost all the time.

02:20.635 --> 02:21.717
I actually did.

02:21.697 --> 02:27.084
When it was over with, two things I remember.

02:27.244 --> 02:30.128
One thing, you wake up in the middle of the night and you wonder what hotel you're in.

02:30.608 --> 02:32.090
And the second, you wonder where's the bathroom.

02:33.011 --> 02:35.374
And that took two or three months to get over.

02:35.394 --> 02:37.217
I don't know, it's just traveling.

02:37.637 --> 02:41.342
Did you ever, on all those trips, did you ever get sick?

02:41.322 --> 02:45.391
Yeah, did get sick once in Southern Valley, Idaho.

02:45.872 --> 02:49.299
Had the flu or something like that, and it was miserable.

02:50.001 --> 02:53.208
Anybody ever serve any astonishingly unusual food?

02:54.330 --> 02:57.778
Yes, in Japan.

02:57.758 --> 02:59.722
I don't know what all we ate there.

03:00.523 --> 03:02.607
We ate Zen food in one place.

03:02.627 --> 03:12.005
We ate, of course, all kinds of raw fish that I swore I'd never eat, but when you're their guest of honor, well, you try to honor them.

03:14.509 --> 03:15.792
No monkey?

03:16.613 --> 03:17.114
No monkey.

03:17.214 --> 03:17.835
No snake?

03:18.136 --> 03:20.340
No, not far as I know.

03:20.320 --> 03:23.867
to raise some money in South Korea for Missouri.

03:23.907 --> 03:33.625
They promised us in advance, we won't feed you any dog or any cat or any monkey or any snake.

03:33.645 --> 03:36.270
But there were some other things that I'm not sure.

03:36.250 --> 03:49.132
For that whole year, you were on leave, and then when you came back, what was it like to get re-immersed?

03:49.152 --> 03:51.897
It took a while to get adjusted to it, really.

03:51.877 --> 03:58.487
Especially when you sit there and wonder what have I got to get ready next for, you know, for the speech and this type of thing.

03:59.709 --> 04:04.897
Because I tried to, I'm not a very good speaker, but I tried to do the best preparation I could.

04:05.458 --> 04:11.387
And when I did, that's why I got so involved, wherever I go I tried to include the local

04:13.797 --> 04:16.181
you know, history or something like that and particularly history.

04:16.762 --> 04:19.407
For example, I was in Madison, Wisconsin to give a speech there.

04:19.447 --> 04:19.968
I remember that.

04:20.448 --> 04:26.519
And I went up to the state capitol building and went up the rotunda and they had all these statues up there and there was a, I had a story to tell about that.

04:26.559 --> 04:33.190
And so you use that to introduce your speech and then how do you tie it up?

04:33.170 --> 04:35.734
It took me a while to get over having to do something like that.

04:36.315 --> 04:39.119
Now, who made all of the travel arrangements for you?

04:39.159 --> 04:40.141
We did, yeah.

04:40.161 --> 04:40.321
Here?

04:40.922 --> 04:41.623
Yeah.

04:41.863 --> 04:44.147
We generally used Hall of Soul Travel Agency.

04:44.167 --> 04:45.088
They did very well for it.

04:45.229 --> 04:46.851
So it was not national, it was y'all did.

04:46.871 --> 04:46.971
Yeah.

04:47.592 --> 04:55.144
There is a way you can do it through the national headquarters, but we tried them and we found it was so

04:55.782 --> 05:00.810
They really don't realize how College Station is to get in and out of, so as far as air transport.

05:00.830 --> 05:04.196
So we, it's best to do it here.

05:04.577 --> 05:05.178
That's what we did.

05:05.198 --> 05:07.702
All right, you said 42, you were gone 42 weekends.

05:07.722 --> 05:09.024
42 weekends out of one year.

05:09.044 --> 05:10.567
Any other measurements that you?

05:10.907 --> 05:14.854
No, we went to like 48 states, I don't know how many,

05:15.239 --> 05:16.861
Don't know how many miles.

05:17.482 --> 05:19.665
I figured once about a million and a half or something like that.

05:19.685 --> 05:20.305
It's amazing.

05:21.487 --> 05:27.735
Did you remember any real travel snafus where you got left here?

05:28.536 --> 05:34.904
Yeah, well, we had some real travel snafus at the time too.

05:35.765 --> 05:37.247
We had to go to

05:38.847 --> 05:45.375
Fort Lauderdale, Florida from Charlotteville, North Carolina.

05:46.116 --> 05:50.361
To get there, we got there from East Lansing, Michigan.

05:51.803 --> 06:03.657
The only way we could get back, with that cost about ten times as much, we had to fly back to East Lansing and there to Chicago, from Chicago to Nashville, from Nashville to

06:03.637 --> 06:05.359
Miami, Miami.

06:05.379 --> 06:07.161
To Fort Lauderdale.

06:07.301 --> 06:08.923
We got there in the middle of the night.

06:09.664 --> 06:12.266
By the time we got to the hotel, our room was gone.

06:12.307 --> 06:13.228
He knew it was reserved.

06:13.328 --> 06:19.014
They got us in another room about a mile away, but we had to be back there the next day for the meeting that was supposed to be at.

06:20.916 --> 06:21.737
You went to Japan.

06:21.817 --> 06:22.598
What other nations?

06:22.638 --> 06:23.259
Australia.

06:24.780 --> 06:31.888
That was the longest trip a flight ever took as far as misery, you might say.

06:32.189 --> 06:37.278
Of all of the places where you landed, which one was the most fun, the most enjoyable?

06:38.199 --> 06:40.002
Of all the places you land, which was the most fun?

06:40.483 --> 06:40.944
Gosh.

06:42.967 --> 06:44.630
You mean enjoyable at the being there?

06:45.151 --> 06:45.331
Mm-hmm.

06:45.351 --> 06:45.952
Okay.

06:45.972 --> 06:46.974
Gosh, that's a good question.

06:49.138 --> 06:52.403
The way you were treated, the way they fed you, where they put you up, and so forth.

06:52.764 --> 06:53.505
Oh, gosh.

06:56.962 --> 06:59.565
Probably they treated us best of all.

06:59.765 --> 07:02.669
I think the best was Indianapolis, Indiana.

07:06.633 --> 07:11.679
It's just, you know, the way we were treated, they were just this.

07:11.740 --> 07:13.061
But they treated us very in Japan.

07:13.141 --> 07:16.846
They treated us very well there.

07:16.886 --> 07:19.729
They met us at the airport.

07:20.182 --> 07:22.979
We had to take a connecting flight.

07:24.408 --> 07:25.294
We had a translator.

07:25.414 --> 07:27.306
It took us.

07:27.607 --> 07:29.449
We didn't go through the usual security.

07:29.469 --> 07:31.171
We went through a VIP thing.

07:31.231 --> 07:32.292
They drove us out the plane.

07:32.312 --> 07:36.857
The plane was waiting for us, got on, took off, flew across the country.

07:37.317 --> 07:40.040
Then they had a chauffeur limousine pick us up there.

07:40.521 --> 07:41.442
We drove the place.

07:41.842 --> 07:44.485
Coming back, we took the bullet train.

07:44.825 --> 07:47.748
And all along the way, they just leaned over backwards to help us.

07:48.309 --> 07:49.190
Big snafu there.

07:49.210 --> 07:50.912
I shouldn't mention this.

07:51.752 --> 07:55.116
But on the bullet train, you're supposed to keep your ticket to get off.

07:55.552 --> 07:57.816
Martha left her ticket in the pocket on the train.

07:58.497 --> 08:03.085
I thought we were going to have an international incident because we had to go upstairs to security and then went through the whole thing.

08:03.105 --> 08:04.948
But she's still embarrassed about that.

08:04.968 --> 08:06.270
But I didn't know it.

08:06.330 --> 08:10.757
I just happened to put my ticket in my coat pocket all the time and I just happened to have it that way.

08:12.039 --> 08:17.408
When you got back, what reception did you get from your colleagues?

08:17.489 --> 08:18.370
From where?

08:18.417 --> 08:21.361
No, no, when you finished that year.

08:21.382 --> 08:22.704
Oh, they wondered where I'd been.

08:24.166 --> 08:27.551
No, very, very cordial, very cordial.

08:27.571 --> 08:27.771
All right.

08:27.791 --> 08:30.415
By then, Dean Shelton had retired.

08:31.016 --> 08:31.136
Right.

08:31.156 --> 08:32.959
And who followed him as dean?

08:32.979 --> 08:34.562
Shattuck, John Shattuck, yeah.

08:34.582 --> 08:35.563
And he came from?

08:36.424 --> 08:37.526
Ohio, Illinois.

08:38.207 --> 08:39.269
Was he dean at Illinois?

08:39.409 --> 08:40.430
No, he was department head there.

08:40.450 --> 08:41.272
Department head came here.

08:41.532 --> 08:42.854
And he was dean about how long?

08:43.996 --> 08:45.638
About five years, I think.

08:45.779 --> 08:46.720
Four or five years, yeah.

08:46.700 --> 08:58.100
All right, and Dean Gage, his first name Dean, had been the exec, the, he had replaced Wally Bay when he retired.

08:58.181 --> 08:58.361
Right.

08:59.142 --> 09:01.727
And did he overlap under Shattuck?

09:03.530 --> 09:04.552
Yes, a little bit, yes.

09:04.732 --> 09:05.253
Yeah, yeah.

09:05.273 --> 09:05.714
Yeah, he did.

09:06.215 --> 09:07.898
In a fairly short period of time.

09:08.165 --> 09:17.819
Am I correct in understanding that he was the day-to-day manager for?

09:17.919 --> 09:19.361
Yeah.

09:19.502 --> 09:24.909
I can't remember exactly how long he stayed, but of course he went on up.

09:26.852 --> 09:28.755
Then Shattuck is followed by?

09:29.478 --> 09:33.105
By interim dean Bob Plater.

09:34.027 --> 09:34.347
Plater?

09:34.548 --> 09:35.409
Plater, yeah.

09:35.429 --> 09:36.251
P-L-A-T-E-R.

09:36.271 --> 09:36.692
Yeah.

09:36.712 --> 09:37.854
And then whom?

09:37.894 --> 09:38.976
Then Richard Adams.

09:39.357 --> 09:40.138
The current dean.

09:40.158 --> 09:40.258
Yeah.

09:40.358 --> 09:40.739
All right.

09:41.040 --> 09:43.685
Bob was here a little over a year, year and a half, I guess.

09:44.526 --> 09:48.634
What, during the Shattuck years, what changes were there?

09:48.614 --> 09:49.535
diminished changes.

09:50.877 --> 10:02.735
He felt like there were too many departments and to make it more administratively feasible and I guess say the department had salary.

10:02.755 --> 10:06.621
He, we had seven departments, he created five departments.

10:06.681 --> 10:11.348
He was going to have three, but he combined there were some

10:11.328 --> 10:16.834
They bind veterinary public health and anatomy to one department.

10:17.454 --> 10:18.796
Right, and so you ended up in?

10:19.616 --> 10:20.277
Anatomy, yeah.

10:20.297 --> 10:20.798
Anatomy.

10:20.818 --> 10:22.259
Yeah.

10:22.279 --> 10:24.561
Describe his leadership style.

10:24.962 --> 10:35.352
His leadership style was, is much different from George Shelton.

10:35.432 --> 10:40.137
He's a very articulate speaker, but he,

10:42.023 --> 10:53.464
He would make decisions fairly rapidly and sometimes didn't seem like much thought went into him, as far as I'm concerned.

10:53.484 --> 10:54.846
Anyway, he made them very, very quick.

10:55.507 --> 11:06.006
And during the Shelton and Shattuck years, well, in fact, in the last 20, 25 years,

11:05.986 --> 11:11.314
the faculty has become geographically far more diverse.

11:11.394 --> 11:12.215
Yeah, they have.

11:12.235 --> 11:13.357
Right, yeah.

11:14.779 --> 11:19.747
And I'm assuming far more doctoral, PhD.

11:19.947 --> 11:21.049
Right, right.

11:21.069 --> 11:22.851
Pure veterinarians, yeah.

11:22.891 --> 11:24.193
Particularly in the basic sciences.

11:25.455 --> 11:30.002
And Shattuck was pretty much, he really,

11:32.058 --> 11:35.883
emphasized research much more than George Shelton did.

11:35.903 --> 11:41.910
I mean, he really, well, research was the thing, period.

11:42.391 --> 11:43.072
If the.

11:43.092 --> 11:44.954
And NIH funds was.

11:44.974 --> 11:52.564
If the faculty had voted their feelings about Dr. Shattuck, what do you think would have been the majority?

11:52.965 --> 11:53.385
Majority?

11:53.425 --> 11:55.207
Well, they did vote.

11:55.227 --> 11:55.408
Did they?

11:55.428 --> 11:55.748
Yeah.

11:55.768 --> 11:56.729
Oh, I didn't know.

11:56.749 --> 11:56.849
Yeah.

11:56.869 --> 12:01.255
They had a, after he's named dean, they had a faculty meeting

12:02.686 --> 12:07.096
I did not go to it because I was on the search committee of that too and I didn't feel like it was appropriate.

12:08.298 --> 12:16.556
It was announced that he was coming and the faculty voted to send him a letter asking him not to come.

12:17.538 --> 12:22.990
So he came under, you've got to admire him, he came under some very almost hostile

12:23.628 --> 12:26.514
Did the faculty have a favorite you think at that time?

12:26.975 --> 12:28.639
Yes, yeah.

12:28.659 --> 12:30.303
Are you at liberty to say who you think it was?

12:30.383 --> 12:36.196
Well, there were two names sent forward, Dean Gage and J.D.

12:36.476 --> 12:36.777
Crady.

12:38.495 --> 12:41.522
So his name wasn't even sent forward.

12:41.542 --> 12:42.505
Who was president then?

12:43.306 --> 12:46.053
President Mobley?

12:46.514 --> 12:47.597
Yeah, Mobley, yeah.

12:48.900 --> 12:54.934
But the vice president for research.

12:56.517 --> 12:57.859
I don't know.

12:58.219 --> 12:58.960
I can't remember his name.

12:59.001 --> 13:01.584
He's from Illinois and knew Shattuck up there.

13:02.445 --> 13:03.767
I think that's what happened anyway.

13:04.849 --> 13:06.151
All right.

13:06.511 --> 13:14.503
And then the selection of Adams, was that a popular choice as far as you know?

13:14.543 --> 13:16.445
Pretty much so, yeah.

13:16.646 --> 13:19.229
It boiled down to two people, I think.

13:19.249 --> 13:20.932
I wasn't on the search committee, so I don't know.

13:21.613 --> 13:24.617
But just talked to my colleagues.

13:24.597 --> 13:30.385
the present dean of Missouri was, was looked on in favor as well as the dean that was there.

13:30.986 --> 13:41.140
I mean, Joe Carnegie was looked up very, very, very, but he did not have the, the, I guess, what hurt administrative experience that Richard Adams had.

13:43.763 --> 13:44.404
Well, I guess.

13:45.726 --> 13:52.936
This unusual connection between Missouri and Texas.

13:52.976 --> 13:54.418
Yeah.

13:56.491 --> 13:59.756
As far as I'm aware, it wasn't planned and wasn't deliberate.

13:59.956 --> 14:00.537
No, it wasn't.

14:00.557 --> 14:01.498
No, no.

14:01.518 --> 14:03.120
It wasn't.

14:03.141 --> 14:08.668
It's ironic that both of them had been A&M graduates, both Aggies, and they came back here.

14:09.229 --> 14:13.215
Well, and Shelton, it was not because he was a Texan.

14:13.555 --> 14:13.736
No.

14:13.896 --> 14:14.397
No, it wasn't.

14:15.218 --> 14:16.339
He was the best candidate.

14:16.780 --> 14:19.945
I mean, you were there.

14:19.965 --> 14:23.730
And really, we had a lot of good candidates.

14:23.710 --> 14:26.795
I thought for the search committee when Dean Gage and J.D.

14:27.356 --> 14:33.627
McCready, another, the number three in that group was Bill Jenkins.

14:34.809 --> 14:39.137
And of course he went to be dean at LSU, now he's president of the university.

14:39.117 --> 14:41.140
system over there.

14:41.321 --> 14:42.282
Three good candidates.

14:42.663 --> 14:55.183
During these recent decades, have women been well accepted as faculty and students and so forth, you think?

14:55.443 --> 14:56.385
Yeah.

14:56.405 --> 15:04.197
Are there any women that you think deserve particular credit for being good role model faculty members here?

15:04.177 --> 15:05.399
Sure, there's a couple.

15:05.419 --> 15:08.765
Of course, Bonnie Beaver would be one I think would be a good one, Bonnie Beaver.

15:10.387 --> 15:15.937
Another one is, well, there's several very good ones.

15:15.957 --> 15:18.842
The second one I think of after Bonnie Beaver would be Debbie Kochever.

15:19.563 --> 15:20.785
Debbie Kochever?

15:20.765 --> 15:24.291
K-O-C-H-E-V-E-A-R.

15:26.455 --> 15:28.078
She's in Physiology, Pharmacology.

15:28.098 --> 15:29.200
She's very, very good.

15:31.083 --> 15:33.908
We won't hold her against her because she's a Rice graduate of course she came here.

15:34.790 --> 15:36.953
But Debbie, he's a real, real model.

15:37.534 --> 15:41.862
And it's been considered, her name's been mentioned for hire.

15:41.842 --> 15:52.425
Are there some faculty with international backgrounds that also deserve or are worthy of mention?

15:54.025 --> 15:56.148
Well, there's some here that are researchers.

15:57.951 --> 16:07.647
Steve Safe is our, I guess, our leading researcher as far as, you know, he's in his chair and is internationally known.

16:09.450 --> 16:12.375
He's not a veterinarian, but he is international and he's very respected.

16:12.395 --> 16:13.096
He's from Canada.

16:13.897 --> 16:15.139
He'll be the first one I think of.

16:16.891 --> 16:19.794
We had one in the department, Jose Pediatra.

16:19.814 --> 16:20.474
I can't spell it.

16:20.494 --> 16:21.455
I'll have to get it for you.

16:22.016 --> 16:23.237
He's fairly well-respected.

16:26.980 --> 16:27.361
Gosh.

16:29.483 --> 16:31.404
Dense.

16:31.444 --> 16:33.186
Those are the two I think I got first of all.

16:33.206 --> 16:37.890
In recent years, what does the Texas A&M College of Air Medicine do best?

16:38.771 --> 16:42.234
What's it do best?

16:42.254 --> 16:45.177
I think it does best with,

16:48.329 --> 16:51.793
As far as teaching or research or just what it does best.

16:52.594 --> 16:58.640
I think it does best with its, with its spinal medicine and surgery.

16:59.141 --> 16:59.962
Small animal?

16:59.982 --> 17:01.644
Medicine and surgery.

17:02.885 --> 17:06.509
I think it's very well respected for its contributions here.

17:07.570 --> 17:12.075
It does very well in parts of equine medicine, pretty well there.

17:13.726 --> 17:23.487
In basic sciences, well, toxicology I think has become more well known for toxicology, particularly since Steve Safe has been fairly well involved.

17:24.469 --> 17:29.760
And of course, in genetics,

17:32.238 --> 17:37.047
WOMAC, W-O-M-A-C internationally known.

17:37.067 --> 17:38.209
It's recognized there.

17:38.269 --> 17:39.832
So it's got a lot of recognition.

17:39.852 --> 17:48.188
But I'd say veterinarians out in the field, the small animal surgery medicine would be the one that they'd think of most.

17:48.168 --> 17:51.134
And you said we would be in the top few.

17:51.154 --> 17:52.918
I'd say in the top five now.

17:53.238 --> 17:55.282
Who would be the other, some of the others?

17:55.463 --> 18:10.092
The other ones up there would be California Davis, the, gosh, Penn is always up there, University of Pennsylvania, Cornell.

18:11.540 --> 18:14.723
I think North Carolina State's moved up in that group.

18:16.685 --> 18:18.026
I guess that's about it, really.

18:19.488 --> 18:20.288
But it varies with the area.

18:20.348 --> 18:24.352
Like K-State, I think, if you talk about food animal medicine, K-State had to be the leader there.

18:25.073 --> 18:25.313
All right.

18:25.333 --> 18:28.977
Then, of all the research you've done, of what are you most proud?

18:30.558 --> 18:32.740
Well, probably my rabies research.

18:32.820 --> 18:40.888
Even though I didn't get to publish it because I was going to continue it on, I had some problems with animal welfare people.

18:42.100 --> 18:45.224
So it, I guess that'd be the most important.

18:45.905 --> 18:48.629
And what are you working on now and planning to work on next?

18:48.709 --> 18:50.031
Well, I'm not doing any right now.

18:50.812 --> 18:52.114
Just full-time teaching.

18:52.534 --> 18:56.300
About three years ago, they started a program.

18:57.902 --> 19:04.611
It was out at the FSIS Training Center, which is down the road here, the Don Houston Training Center.

19:04.931 --> 19:07.996
They bring in USDA employees from all over the country, and they've been having training programs.

19:08.016 --> 19:09.778
They started an educational program.

19:09.758 --> 19:21.974
where they bring students in for four or people in for four weeks and give them an intense background in food safety, including microbiology, the whole works, and they get five hours of credit for it.

19:24.517 --> 19:28.663
Dr. Bratton, our chair, they asked me if I would teach out there part-time.

19:28.743 --> 19:35.091
In other words, I'm still full-time here, but teach out there and not do my research for a while and do that.

19:35.071 --> 19:41.002
Well, I started three years ago, and then last year they started bringing veterinarians in and doing the same thing for them.

19:41.604 --> 19:42.766
So it's a graduate level there.

19:42.826 --> 19:47.114
So because I'm doing that, there's not time to do that.

19:47.134 --> 19:51.042
And they pay money, which comes to the department, so I've got money just like I would have for research.

19:51.082 --> 19:54.308
I could do research if I could get some time, so I'm not doing it right now.

19:55.130 --> 19:57.855
Throughout all these now 40 years,

19:58.510 --> 20:01.493
What is a normal workday schedule for you?

20:02.294 --> 20:03.456
Normal workday schedule?

20:04.717 --> 20:06.860
Generally, I come in sometimes 4-8.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.602
Generally, it's about 8-15, 8-20.

20:09.463 --> 20:11.485
I leave about 5-30, sometimes 6.

20:11.825 --> 20:12.807
And where do you have lunch?

20:13.427 --> 20:14.408
I have lunch right here.

20:14.949 --> 20:16.811
Do you bring it?

20:16.951 --> 20:17.973
I bring it generally, yeah.

20:18.033 --> 20:21.316
What is lunch compared to what?

20:21.336 --> 20:23.539
What Martha has in the refrigerator.

20:23.519 --> 20:30.130
Generally an apple or orange or a banana, maybe a couple, three cookies, and then a sandwich of some type.

20:31.072 --> 20:32.575
And what do you do for recreation?

20:32.935 --> 20:33.536
Recreation?

20:35.640 --> 20:37.062
Boy, that's a good question.

20:37.804 --> 20:39.186
Go home and relax.

20:39.807 --> 20:42.372
Because you and I play the same amount of golf, which is zero.

20:42.432 --> 20:43.754
Yeah, zero, yeah, and that's one reason.

20:43.774 --> 20:48.362
Martha said, if you're tired, you don't play golf, what you're going to do is stay around the house all day.

20:49.085 --> 20:50.769
Recreation, I read.

20:51.130 --> 20:51.692
I just read.

20:52.253 --> 20:57.608
I like to do stuff outside, but when you have rain all the time, that kind of discourages any outside activities.

20:58.169 --> 21:01.137
So I guess I don't watch much TV.

21:01.177 --> 21:05.288
I like to listen to radio talk shows at night and read.

21:05.538 --> 21:07.560
Do you all do much traveling these days?

21:07.760 --> 21:08.821
Do some traveling.

21:09.782 --> 21:11.644
We're getting ready to go to Australia next month.

21:11.664 --> 21:12.805
I've got a meeting down there.

21:13.546 --> 21:19.031
I represent the AVMA on the World Veterinary Association Council, so I got.

21:20.032 --> 21:21.093
Are you going to Melbourne?

21:21.293 --> 21:22.495
Melbourne, right, Melbourne.

21:22.515 --> 21:24.396
Have you seen the fairy penguins?

21:24.416 --> 21:25.778
No, I've never seen them.

21:25.798 --> 21:26.539
Oh.

21:26.559 --> 21:29.101
You want to go, it's about 25 or 30 miles up.

21:31.463 --> 21:33.165
Back off.

21:33.382 --> 21:38.203
What are the joys of being a professional veterinarian?

21:39.086 --> 21:40.894
Joys?

21:41.937 --> 21:43.238
First of all, being a profession.

21:44.099 --> 21:46.622
What's satisfying about this?

21:46.642 --> 21:47.483
Satisfying?

21:47.763 --> 21:54.771
You feel like you're doing something for our animal kingdom and also human beings because I'm involved in public health.

21:54.791 --> 22:00.357
To know that for years I've been involved with the rabies prevention programs for our students are concerned.

22:01.138 --> 22:07.084
We no longer have been that closely involved because now they have to have vaccination for the InterVeterinary School.

22:07.064 --> 22:09.086
But I used to do it after they got in veterinary school.

22:09.487 --> 22:15.353
But knowing that you protect them and you're there for source information, it gives you some satisfaction that way.

22:16.034 --> 22:21.820
But just knowing that you can prevent people from having some type of misery like that, it's part of it.

22:21.840 --> 22:32.532
And of course, I'm not involved in treating animals or anything like that, but teaching about how animals' diseases are transmitted, this type of thing, gives me some satisfaction.

22:32.512 --> 22:36.901
And what about the joy and pride of being a part of this institution?

22:37.463 --> 22:39.206
Well, it makes you feel proud.

22:39.306 --> 22:46.882
When you go anywhere, particularly in Texas, they know where you're from, but anywhere else, they know where you're from, and they give you, I mean, it makes you feel good.

22:47.263 --> 22:51.853
They give you some degree of honor, yeah.

22:53.960 --> 22:58.506
Have there been any missed opportunities for this College of Veterinary Medicine?

22:59.227 --> 23:00.068
Yeah.

23:00.088 --> 23:00.329
Why?

23:00.950 --> 23:09.101
Well, a few years back when Dr. Chattuck was here, we had the opportunity, I thought, to be the number one in food safety in the country, not the world.

23:10.323 --> 23:16.371
And I'd worked out a program with UC Davis, people there, where we'd have a graduate program, one thing.

23:16.391 --> 23:20.777
The students spend part of the time there, part of the time here, and we had this emphasis training center.

23:20.757 --> 23:31.288
I thought that would be a great so-called program to have a graduate degree in food safety, master of science in food safety, and I think the veterinarians are missing not having that.

23:32.209 --> 23:33.450
There's no such thing like that.

23:34.171 --> 23:37.154
Anyway, we did not get the backing for that to get funding.

23:38.255 --> 23:39.517
I think that's a missed opportunity.

23:39.717 --> 23:40.798
Did anybody else do it?

23:41.098 --> 23:42.139
No one else did it, no.

23:43.020 --> 23:44.302
Is it worth trying again?

23:44.402 --> 23:47.625
Yeah, I think it's worth trying again, yeah, but I want to be sure I had backing from

23:47.808 --> 23:49.514
The dean's office.

23:49.795 --> 23:51.039
I just didn't get it before.

23:52.343 --> 23:55.815
And other missed opportunities.

23:56.537 --> 23:59.387
There's always missed opportunities, I guess.

23:59.705 --> 24:06.273
Are there any courses or course emphases that you think in hindsight we might have done?

24:06.853 --> 24:07.113
Yes.

24:07.754 --> 24:10.597
I think we've abandoned food animal medicine to a great degree.

24:12.019 --> 24:14.402
And this includes poultry, for example.

24:14.502 --> 24:16.885
It used to be a required course in poultry diseases.

24:17.125 --> 24:18.547
There's no longer any.

24:18.827 --> 24:21.810
It's optional and very few people take it.

24:22.731 --> 24:25.915
And so veterinarians, as time goes on,

24:25.895 --> 24:29.282
less looked to for expertise in diseases of poultry.

24:30.324 --> 24:31.086
That's one thing.

24:32.148 --> 24:35.374
Food animals, I think there ought to be some way to emphasize that more.

24:36.416 --> 24:40.886
I realize all these students seem to be that they want to go to companion animals.

24:40.906 --> 24:45.034
We need them there, but they're not aware of what's available in food animal medicine.

24:45.014 --> 25:01.759
I'm involved right now with a group of veterinarians in a dairy milk quality program where it goes all the way from the cow to the bottle, so to speak, and we're going to try to develop a program.

25:01.779 --> 25:10.853
We've got patent pending on this process to get the veterinarian back into food safety as far as dairy is concerned.

25:10.833 --> 25:15.397
They're just not using veterinarians like they could and it means a lot to have safe food.

25:16.519 --> 25:18.480
Places like New Zealand have this now and we don't.

25:18.941 --> 25:23.505
So, and they're exporting about 80% of their milk to other parts of the world because they demand that high quality.

25:23.525 --> 25:24.166
We don't have it.

25:24.847 --> 25:26.829
We've got good milk but it's not as high quality as it could be.

25:27.169 --> 25:37.259
So, yes, I think we're missing opportunities there and I'm biased, of course, but what we emphasize, we're giving people what's more visible.

25:38.640 --> 25:40.722
We tend to be more

25:41.731 --> 25:55.125
I think trying to imitate the physician more as far as our training where we ought to go a lot more into economics of food, animal medicine, this type of thing.

25:55.225 --> 26:00.330
To whom do you feel the greatest gratitude looking back over all of these years?

26:01.371 --> 26:02.192
Greatest gratitude?

26:05.275 --> 26:07.958
Who would you, if they could all be here, who would you think most?

26:08.748 --> 26:11.555
I guess Dr. Jaggi for bringing me here to begin with.

26:13.139 --> 26:16.086
I wouldn't have come if he hadn't, you know, paved the way for me to be here.

26:18.151 --> 26:20.477
So I guess the greatest gratitude would be him.

26:21.660 --> 26:25.710
But there's other people like Dr. Mellif was very supportive.

26:25.690 --> 26:29.354
Dr. Grumbles, I didn't mention him at microbiology.

26:30.075 --> 26:38.604
I taught part-time in microbiology for many years and he was always very supportive and he's one of those kind of people that always ask how you're doing.

26:38.884 --> 26:44.310
And of course, Dean Shelton, when he was dean here, very supportive.

26:44.330 --> 26:47.754
I always knew I could go in and talk to him if I had some problems.

26:48.675 --> 26:51.798
It hadn't always been that way, if that makes sense.

26:52.319 --> 26:54.381
So several people, but I'd say George Shelton.

26:54.361 --> 27:09.083
Let's make believe that now you've been hired as the consultant to advise the leadership of this college and of this university about the future.

27:09.143 --> 27:12.488
What advice would you give them?

27:15.185 --> 27:20.970
First of all, I would like to see department heads less dictatorial and more democratic.

27:22.552 --> 27:35.344
I'm not sure I want them to be elected by the faculty, but I think they should be more supportive so there could be more interchange between departments of people so there's not such a solid wall there.

27:35.684 --> 27:41.210
And even though they've made great steps towards collaborative research, there ought to be collaborative teaching.

27:41.370 --> 27:44.753
It should be more transparent than it is.

27:44.733 --> 27:46.095
That's one thing.

27:46.135 --> 27:55.848
Somehow change the administrative setup where it's not an impedent, not a blockage or inhibitory, but more facilitate.

27:57.209 --> 28:02.256
There's a lot of lip service to that, but it's not enough work done that way.

28:02.276 --> 28:03.858
That's one thing I like to see.

28:04.679 --> 28:07.763
Would you change the enrollment size?

28:09.806 --> 28:11.989
No, I don't think so.

28:13.606 --> 28:25.531
I regret all I have lately as far as vet students is lecture courses and with 120, 25 students, you don't get to know them in three hours or four hours a week.

28:25.551 --> 28:27.315
You just, you can't, I can't.

28:28.618 --> 28:31.564
And to me, there ought to be some way

28:33.181 --> 28:42.751
I hate to teach sections, three, four sections, but at least some way to, so you can facilitate knowing those students better so you can, you know, it's hard getting feedback from them, you know.

28:43.632 --> 28:45.855
You're an excellent teacher, you know, your feedback's very important.

28:46.535 --> 28:58.328
And that amorphous mass out there, all you hear sometimes are whiners and the complainers, and you don't hear enough from the people that you want feedback from.

28:58.747 --> 29:06.665
As far as you're aware, is the method of the admissions process, the selection process, is it reasonably appropriate?

29:06.785 --> 29:07.006
No.

29:08.650 --> 29:15.726
It's too much geared towards avoiding

29:17.073 --> 29:18.757
Legal action, the way I look at it.

29:19.459 --> 29:31.707
They're too afraid somebody will... Now this is my impression, that there will be some legal action taken from them because they did not let this person in because of some

29:32.311 --> 29:35.035
racial or some gender preference.

29:35.976 --> 29:46.871
I think that they ought to, if they've got 60% female supply or 5% of this supply, they shouldn't have to take 60%.

29:46.911 --> 29:50.836
They should take, maybe take 80% if need to, but take 40% if they take the best people.

29:50.976 --> 29:52.078
You're saying take the best?

29:52.178 --> 29:53.880
Take the best, yes.

29:53.860 --> 30:05.654
And secondly, although we're funded by the state of Texas, we now can take just a few from out of state, but states like New Mexico and all the states don't have veterinary schools.

30:05.754 --> 30:09.304
We ought to have them the same opportunity to come here as we do.

30:09.284 --> 30:11.306
They say, well, we're training people by the schools.

30:11.326 --> 30:12.367
A lot of those people are going to stay.

30:12.387 --> 30:17.492
A lot of those people are going to go back to New Mexico, but they're going to be very good supporters of Texas A&M.

30:17.512 --> 30:19.754
And I think we ought to break down the state barriers.

30:22.297 --> 30:24.980
I've got only two more items that I can think of.

30:25.040 --> 30:26.801
What have we not touched that we should have?

30:28.483 --> 30:30.765
Gosh, I've done such a poor job even thinking.

30:31.746 --> 30:34.809
You've done splendidly.

30:35.530 --> 30:36.591
What have we not touched?

30:43.439 --> 30:45.243
I think you touched on everything.

30:45.263 --> 30:46.786
Oh, let's see.

30:46.907 --> 30:47.548
I thought of one.

30:48.230 --> 30:57.550
Have you ever had any outside pressure, somebody try to tell you from the

30:58.171 --> 31:08.667
higher administration beyond the vet school or from politics or some important Texan try to tell you what grade to give somebody or?

31:08.967 --> 31:09.688
Yeah, I've had that.

31:10.229 --> 31:10.449
Have you?

31:10.469 --> 31:11.010
Yeah, I ignore it.

31:12.332 --> 31:13.894
Phone calls or letters or what?

31:13.914 --> 31:14.535
I've had letters.

31:14.595 --> 31:20.564
I had one student I gave a B to just last year or the year before last in the graduate course.

31:20.584 --> 31:25.832
He was going to sue me because he thought he deserved an A. I told him, I figured your grade out and it's a B.

31:26.217 --> 31:28.584
But no legislator ever called you?

31:29.171 --> 31:29.697
No.
