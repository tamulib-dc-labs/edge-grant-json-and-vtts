WEBVTT

00:02.377 --> 00:02.878
Throw here.

00:04.881 --> 00:10.131
Well, not long after that, Coach Stalings came over.

00:10.151 --> 00:11.934
He said, I told you you couldn't throw here.

00:11.954 --> 00:23.394
And I explained that, you know, that my coach said I could train here, the athletic director, and that was the deal I had.

00:23.454 --> 00:27.000
And he said something to the fact that I don't

00:28.313 --> 00:33.339
Didn't say exactly like this probably, but I don't care how many medals you won in the Olympics, you know, you can't do it.

00:33.359 --> 00:34.861
And I said, well, fine.

00:35.822 --> 00:36.763
I'll do it somewhere else.

00:38.525 --> 00:42.329
And I went back, called my dad to the dorm and said, I'm probably going to transfer.

00:42.349 --> 00:44.572
He said, son, that's your business.

00:44.612 --> 00:45.793
That's what my dad always was.

00:45.853 --> 00:47.335
You do whatever you think is best.

00:47.415 --> 00:48.536
I'll support you.

00:48.556 --> 00:49.017
I don't know.

00:50.118 --> 00:51.139
It wasn't those kind of deals.

00:51.159 --> 00:53.022
That's the only time I ever called my dad to complain.

00:53.262 --> 00:57.747
And I just called to tell him because I was going to make, I didn't want him to hear about it some other way.

00:58.840 --> 01:03.324
And didn't really ask him so much what I thought as, you know, here's what's happened.

01:04.285 --> 01:05.506
And he was supportive of that.

01:06.647 --> 01:10.591
And may have transferred except for a man named S.M.

01:10.651 --> 01:14.935
Meeks, who was the equipment manager, had been around A&M a long time.

01:16.236 --> 01:21.100
He came over and said, you know, you need to go talk to Coach Dallings.

01:21.120 --> 01:22.842
And I said, I don't want to talk to Coach Dallings.

01:23.383 --> 01:24.904
He said, yeah, you need to go talk to him.

01:25.224 --> 01:28.307
He said, well, you don't want to talk to me probably.

01:29.401 --> 01:31.963
He took me over to Coach Stalin's office.

01:31.983 --> 01:42.092
Coach Stalin, in his way, said, well, maybe a little hasty, but, you know, athletes, young people ought to have more respect for the elders.

01:42.112 --> 01:43.974
He was about 29 then, I think.

01:44.034 --> 01:48.878
But I said, well, I understand that, except, you know, I was told that I could train.

01:49.058 --> 01:51.300
And I said, I'm interested in being the best I can be.

01:52.781 --> 01:55.384
And if I can't do that here, then I'll do it somewhere else.

01:56.124 --> 01:59.087
And he said, well, we'll...

01:59.827 --> 02:02.390
We will take care of you having a place to throw.

02:04.151 --> 02:06.294
Not only that, we'll make it better.

02:06.374 --> 02:13.101
So they put a portable discus ring in Kyle Field and they put another one out behind.

02:13.141 --> 02:14.222
They put one inside.

02:17.085 --> 02:20.248
But they're practicing out on this other one.

02:20.268 --> 02:25.193
And so I go out there and they're watering down Kyle Field.

02:26.742 --> 02:32.532
and probably wasn't good judgment on my part, but I start throwing the discus.

02:33.214 --> 02:45.055
Well, after all the mess they've had, because in the meantime, it got in the paper that Coach Dolenz is running off an Olympic shot putter from A&M, and even General Ruddard called to check out

02:46.520 --> 02:49.650
how that deal had laid out, so had an interest in it.

02:49.770 --> 02:53.923
So I'm tearing up the football field out there.

02:53.943 --> 02:58.015
And so it became a rub that way.

02:59.463 --> 03:02.806
And so, but we worked, finally worked through all that.

03:02.906 --> 03:09.392
Then they tell me, I had a key to the weight room, because I worked out two and a half, three hours a day, and I worked out every Saturday morning.

03:09.932 --> 03:13.395
Saturday morning, those days at A&M was like a deserted place.

03:13.776 --> 03:18.740
And I'm like, sometimes I'm the only one on campus, I think, you know, and I go over in the basement.

03:18.760 --> 03:26.447
Actually, my first weight room at A&M, this shows you why, you know, what I was willing to do versus what would be a Southern Cal.

03:26.467 --> 03:29.149
Mr. Mammaliga borrowed

03:29.551 --> 03:33.188
borrowed without checking out an Olympic weight set from P.E.

03:35.036 --> 03:37.688
and they put it in the dressing room of the track team.

03:38.731 --> 03:46.742
first Olympic set athletics had, and I worked out with the towels and the dirty socks and everything, but I was happy to do that.

03:47.723 --> 03:52.109
Until later, they built a weight room in the bottom of DeWare.

03:52.870 --> 03:58.538
I say built, it was pretty hot, but it wasn't air conditioned and it was pretty grungy down there in the basement.

03:59.319 --> 04:05.127
But because University of Texas had one and it helped in recruiting, so they put a bunch of weights in there and machines.

04:05.107 --> 04:07.473
And so I was working out in there.

04:08.215 --> 04:13.269
And then Coach Dollins said no athlete can be in there without a coach.

04:14.733 --> 04:19.065
So I said, Coach Thomas, are you going to be over here for three hours?

04:19.349 --> 04:25.079
three or four days a week and Saturday mornings, you know, a couple hours, sometimes more because Saturday I don't have classes or anything.

04:25.099 --> 04:26.201
I don't really get in there and work out.

04:27.523 --> 04:29.327
Well, he didn't like the sound of that.

04:29.487 --> 04:33.153
So, but then I got a message I was supposed to turn in my key.

04:34.275 --> 04:43.872
And so I sent word back, I'm going to turn it in, but I'm going to have John Lindsay and Jack Knox there and turn in my key, tell them that I can't compete.

04:44.341 --> 04:49.812
I can't be as good as I could be because I can't work out a regular place, and I was told that was probably going to happen to me.

04:49.852 --> 04:50.774
Well, that was the end.

04:50.794 --> 04:52.277
The key deal never came up again.

04:52.337 --> 04:54.441
Mr. Meeks, I think, probably took care of that again.

04:55.022 --> 05:06.805
So I had a couple of little battles like that through the early years, and it was a transition time for A&M and athletics in those days, and I guess if I feel bad about...

05:07.072 --> 05:07.673
anything.

05:07.753 --> 05:14.384
It was the discomfort of all that that I had to go through and I probably didn't do it as well as I could.

05:15.205 --> 05:24.540
But generally most people were supportive of me and what I was trying to do because I wasn't asking for a lot of things that I probably shouldn't have.

05:24.976 --> 05:28.640
What was your, do you remember your first meet as an Aggie competitor?

05:28.860 --> 05:29.160
Yes.

05:29.400 --> 05:29.641
Where?

05:30.501 --> 05:36.027
It was in my first track meet was New York City indoor meet.

05:36.047 --> 05:36.868
And I flew up there.

05:36.908 --> 05:42.573
They invited the five best shot putters in the country in Madison Square Garden.

05:43.034 --> 05:43.774
And you're a freshman.

05:43.994 --> 05:45.796
And I'm a freshman.

05:45.816 --> 05:53.544
And the only reason they invited me because as a freshman I'd thrown 60 feet, but I wasn't as good as those, and I finished dead last.

05:53.804 --> 05:54.865
But I threw.

05:57.038 --> 06:02.209
59 feet, which was better than a Southwest Conference record.

06:03.131 --> 06:09.664
And I remember I came back and one of my friends, a long time friend, Jim Sebastian, who was a half miler,

06:10.218 --> 06:14.084
And he said, dang, Matson, we've already ruined you.

06:14.124 --> 06:15.145
You finished dead last.

06:15.165 --> 06:16.107
You'll come at A&M.

06:16.507 --> 06:18.410
And I said, well, you mean I broke the Southwest?

06:18.430 --> 06:20.613
Yeah, but you finished dead last.

06:20.633 --> 06:23.277
And so he denies saying that, but I remember that.

06:23.738 --> 06:26.502
I said, boy, they got high expectations of you around here.

06:27.083 --> 06:31.129
I went to L.A., did the same thing, same group, threw around 60 feet.

06:32.611 --> 06:47.235
But shortly after that I threw 62 feet against Danny Roberts, who I had a lot of admiration and respect for, and after that he never beat me.

06:48.096 --> 06:52.864
Before you went to New York, was that your first full indoor meet?

06:52.844 --> 07:01.722
That was the first time any, well actually it was not, one time in high school they had me throwing Lubbock at the Red Raider Relays and I threw about 53 feet.

07:01.762 --> 07:05.650
That was my, I guess that was probably my junior year in high school or something.

07:05.670 --> 07:07.573
What was that trip to New York like?

07:07.874 --> 07:11.882
Well it was, it was,

07:12.487 --> 07:14.050
scary for me to go.

07:14.070 --> 07:17.034
I've been to New York right after I graduated from high school.

07:18.276 --> 07:22.603
I qualified to go to compete against the Russians and over there.

07:23.204 --> 07:29.855
Actually I didn't, I finished third and they were taking two but O'Brien only wanted to throw in the Russian meat and not the rest of the European tour so they took me.

07:30.877 --> 07:34.242
And so I got, that was a tremendous experience for me because

07:35.183 --> 07:45.736
I got to meet a coach that helped me out a great deal later on who was also a shot put coach in 64 and a head coach in 68, Peyton Jordan from Stanford, and we were still close friends.

07:45.776 --> 07:48.880
And he kind of took me under his wing then.

07:49.461 --> 07:51.303
So you went to Europe that summer?

07:52.765 --> 07:58.913
So I went to Europe right after my senior year.

07:59.281 --> 08:02.806
I gained some experience then that was invaluable because then I was a veteran.

08:02.867 --> 08:12.281
From the time I got to A&M I had competed against the best European throwers and the best American throwers and had been competitive.

08:13.483 --> 08:26.503
But going to New York was a real first real indoor meet and I had trouble with indoor shot and I was on my own, went by myself, had to get to the place.

08:27.277 --> 08:31.843
And this is something that people will have a hard time understanding today.

08:33.265 --> 08:40.615
But when I got there, they said, we've got you in a room at the hotel right across from the old Madison Square Garden.

08:40.875 --> 08:41.977
Nice hotel.

08:43.299 --> 08:45.742
We've got you in a room with one of your teammates.

08:46.523 --> 08:48.306
And I said, well, none of my teammates are here.

08:48.366 --> 08:48.886
I'm the only one.

08:49.027 --> 08:50.609
Well, it's from Texas.

08:52.351 --> 08:54.334
So I went up to the room and went in.

08:54.474 --> 08:56.777
And there wasn't anybody there, but the bags were there.

08:57.500 --> 09:04.154
it was a high jumper from Texas Southern which was all black school.

09:04.174 --> 09:16.519
And I went back down the stairs and I said look I can't do that because I'm from Texas in 1963 that that's just something you wouldn't do.

09:17.621 --> 09:19.204
And I had never

09:19.437 --> 09:22.823
run across that before, but I knew what had been expected of me.

09:25.508 --> 09:27.391
They said, we don't understand what you're saying.

09:27.432 --> 09:34.544
I said, well, he's black and I'm white and you can't do that in Texas.

09:34.565 --> 09:35.687
Well, we don't have any other rooms.

09:35.787 --> 09:36.849
I said, then I'm going home.

09:37.650 --> 09:42.559
And I was headed for the door and they stopped me and they put me in the bridal suite.

09:44.378 --> 09:50.449
And if that would have gotten, even then, public knowledge, it probably would have hurt me some.

09:51.551 --> 09:53.114
Not back in Texas, it wouldn't.

09:53.134 --> 10:05.496
But what was interesting, two years later, I'm traveling all over Europe with Ralph Boston, a black long jumper from Tennessee that was a great Olympian and a great friend and someone I love seeing right now.

10:05.536 --> 10:09.002
We're traveling all over Europe, rooming together, and I think nothing about it.

10:08.982 --> 10:13.287
From that point of view, you know, track and field changed a lot for me that way.

10:13.567 --> 10:14.588
It exposed me to a lot.

10:15.008 --> 10:19.653
But in 1963, when I got up there, that would have been an unacceptable thing to do.

10:19.954 --> 10:23.017
It's amazing how things have changed over the years.

10:23.658 --> 10:33.268
Did you see any, on that first trip to New York City, did you see anything that stunned you or shocked you about big time track and big crowds and so forth?

10:33.248 --> 10:38.043
All, you know, I was so intent in competing, I don't think I paid much attention to that.

10:38.063 --> 10:42.195
It was a big crowd in Madison Square Garden, but said I'd already been to Europe,

10:42.665 --> 10:52.959
50,000 in Germany and chanting and came down out of the stands and it took us an hour to get out of the stadium.

10:52.979 --> 10:53.880
We had a good track team.

10:53.920 --> 11:02.391
We had Bob Hayes and some guys like that over there and so in Europe I found out it was tracks a lot different than it was in this country.

11:02.631 --> 11:09.060
Were big time, as far as you knew, were big world class track athletes drinking or

11:09.040 --> 11:24.940
Well, that was before anyone knew about, at least in this country, because the first time steroids came into play in track and field, or before then there was something,

11:25.460 --> 11:54.268
little talk about amphetamines or something to pet pills or something but as far as steroids the first time I ever heard of steroids was 1964 when we're at the Olympic trials and they were talking about the Russians and these Germans are taking something and Americans experimented was starting to because it was not illegal then it was it was not banned there was and no one knew much about it to the point where I got some of them came home and

11:54.755 --> 12:00.411
and looked into doing it, and I went to a doctor here at one of them.

12:01.859 --> 12:06.845
and I'm sure it was Dr. McQuaid, who was the athletic doctor in those days.

12:08.367 --> 12:20.561
And he pulled out and read the brochure that went with it and looked at me and said, well, you know, there's a potential of affecting your glands that normally produce those drugs.

12:20.761 --> 12:26.448
And the other thing is, if you have a cancer or something like that, it may feed it.

12:26.468 --> 12:28.270
Well, that's all I need to know, you know.

12:28.911 --> 12:30.212
It wasn't worth that to me.

12:30.496 --> 12:32.679
But other than that it wasn't illegal in those days.

12:32.779 --> 12:40.169
Now what they were doing then, even the Germans and Russians, were so minor, such small amounts and stuff compared to now.

12:40.509 --> 12:46.457
By 1968 it had become a major deal where they even started testing in 68.

12:46.477 --> 12:48.099
That's when they first started testing.

12:48.499 --> 12:55.208
And even though the tests weren't very good then, and a lot of athletes improved real fast because of steroids I think.

12:55.729 --> 13:00.435
In your own routine of what you ate and drank then, what were your guidelines?

13:00.415 --> 13:10.882
Well when I got to A&M I was little so I needed to gain weight so I mean I ate protein tablets and supplements and vitamins and all that and just ate as much as I could.

13:11.704 --> 13:13.790
Nutrition wasn't as big a deal back then.

13:13.830 --> 13:15.133
Diets weren't as big a deal.

13:15.839 --> 13:18.042
Did you drink coffee, a soft drink?

13:18.082 --> 13:22.068
Yeah, I started doing, you know, those kind of things.

13:22.088 --> 13:22.468
Ice cream?

13:22.568 --> 13:24.050
Oh yeah, all that kind of stuff.

13:24.211 --> 13:25.753
And, you know, I was trying to gain weight.

13:25.813 --> 13:29.939
I'd go to meet in California and come back and lose, I lost 7, 8, 10 pounds.

13:29.979 --> 13:31.461
You know, I was having trouble keeping it on.

13:32.622 --> 13:38.050
And, but it, you know,

13:38.840 --> 13:43.727
The diet and business wasn't as important today.

13:44.388 --> 13:50.157
The athletes trained I think hard in different ways.

13:50.217 --> 13:52.861
They didn't, not as many trained all year round.

13:52.921 --> 13:58.129
I was one of the first probably that in this part of the country that trained all year round.

13:59.231 --> 14:01.354
Perry O'Brien did and some of those guys but

14:02.144 --> 14:04.748
Now athletes can do it because they can make a living.

14:04.788 --> 14:06.451
It was a sacrifice in those days.

14:06.932 --> 14:07.373
All right.

14:07.393 --> 14:13.543
That first year, the Olympics, the 64 Olympics held in the summer?

14:13.563 --> 14:14.945
Held in October.

14:15.005 --> 14:15.406
October.

14:15.506 --> 14:16.247
In Tokyo.

14:16.268 --> 14:16.468
All right.

14:17.229 --> 14:21.336
How did your spring track season go that first year?

14:21.396 --> 14:26.785
Well, I had a real good, I was improving every week and it was one of the most fun ones I'd had.

14:26.765 --> 14:37.476
I was kind of a long shot early in the year for the Olympics until I threw 64 feet and one inch.

14:39.379 --> 14:49.409
No, I threw 63-11, I think, down in Houston to meet at Rice, which put me into being one that I had a pretty good shot then.

14:49.469 --> 14:51.051
I was one of four or five that

14:51.470 --> 14:53.512
would be favored to get a spot on the team.

14:53.572 --> 15:00.180
It was going to take about 63 feet, probably, maybe a little bit more to make the team, they figured.

15:00.200 --> 15:05.566
Dallas Long, by then, had thrown 65-7, which was the record.

15:05.626 --> 15:13.815
He'd improved that to 66-3 that summer, and so he was sitting out there with a 66-3, and

15:13.795 --> 15:24.852
and Perry O'Brien was in there about 63 and a half and I had that 63 and Gary Gubner was about 62-11 from New York so then after that it got pretty slim.

15:26.295 --> 15:37.072
So I went to New York to compete, actually New Jersey, to compete in the national AAU meet and Dallas Long was there and was not in good shape.

15:37.132 --> 15:40.377
He'd been sick a little bit and he was in dental school and

15:41.032 --> 15:43.623
and was having a hard time, you know, getting it all together.

15:43.683 --> 15:45.731
And he threw 63 feet and I threw 64.

15:45.892 --> 15:50.772
Won and beat him and O'Brien, both of them.

15:52.169 --> 16:16.506
and then uh i realized i really had that that's when i realized that i not only had a chance but i'd be disappointed if i didn't make the team so that for you was that a important psychological me that was i beat him in the meat even though he wasn't at his best but the other guys were there too and i beat them and it was a competition between me and him instead of them now i still had old brian to deal with because he was

16:16.874 --> 16:25.754
the king of psychology and all that and he was a tough competitor and won a lot of meets on his last throw and there's a kind of mystique about him.

16:26.977 --> 16:28.981
So we go to, they had two trials that year.

16:30.605 --> 16:35.997
Then they had one in Randall's Island, New York and

16:36.702 --> 16:42.993
I'm in third place going into the last round, which puts me in the sixth that they're going to take to the next meet.

16:43.013 --> 17:00.163
They're going to take six longs out there, about 64-11 or something, and O'Brien's at like 63-8, and I threw 63-11 on my last throw to beat O'Brien, which was another milestone.

17:00.183 --> 17:01.866
Even though I didn't throw like I should have,

17:02.234 --> 17:17.222
beating him on my last throw was something that he never get you know he did that to you so and I remember the good feeling I had when he just when he talked to me and just you know stomped out of the stadium I knew I'd arrived then because

17:17.877 --> 17:19.039
He was mad.

17:20.663 --> 17:35.532
So then I go to the duel meet with the Russians, which was a big meet for me because they took two throwers, Long and me, because we finished first and second at the AAU meet in a duel with the Russians.

17:35.512 --> 17:40.460
And that was a milestone too in a different way.

17:40.521 --> 17:43.426
Dallas Long threw 67-10, a new world record.

17:43.466 --> 17:47.432
I threw 62-10, which got beat by five feet.

17:48.013 --> 17:50.658
But not only that, is one of the Russians beat me.

17:51.099 --> 17:55.967
And I was the first American that got beat in a duel meet with the Russians in the shot put.

17:55.947 --> 18:04.617
and I came home and trained like I never had before and I started throwing a lot more and trying to get ready.

18:05.198 --> 18:25.482
We came back to the trials and I threw like 64 something along through 65 and O'Brien got the third spot back about 62, 11 or 63 so it turned out like it was supposed to then O'Brien goes into this real intense training for the Olympics so there's a lot of

18:25.462 --> 18:30.930
Probably they would have guessed that he was probably going to beat me in the Olympics, you know, when I got out there.

18:30.950 --> 18:32.853
And then we went to Tokyo.

18:33.354 --> 18:34.476
I trained in California.

18:34.496 --> 18:35.537
I stayed out there and trained.

18:36.659 --> 18:38.502
Stayed with the team and trained the whole time.

18:38.782 --> 18:39.003
Where?

18:39.403 --> 18:45.673
Well we lived at San Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo, a nice spot up there.

18:45.753 --> 18:46.554
We trained down at Mt.

18:46.574 --> 18:48.297
Sag Junior College.

18:48.277 --> 18:51.861
And I threw in some meats out there, all comers meats.

18:51.881 --> 18:57.186
But I was really, all I was doing was eating, lifting weights, and throwing.

18:58.247 --> 19:04.353
And by the time we got, I was in really good shape the time I got to Tokyo.

19:04.654 --> 19:07.697
And I'm training at about 63 or 4 feet, which is good for me.

19:09.298 --> 19:11.500
Peyton McKnight's the coach.

19:12.301 --> 19:13.482
Wait, wait, wait.

19:13.803 --> 19:16.005
Peyton McKnight is the shot put coach.

19:16.846 --> 19:18.648
Peyton McKnight?

19:18.668 --> 19:18.888
Excuse me.

19:21.590 --> 19:23.152
Not Peyton McKnight, that's the old Regent.

19:23.192 --> 19:23.992
Yeah, yeah, that's why.

19:24.653 --> 19:25.494
Peyton Jordan.

19:25.514 --> 19:26.174
Yeah, yeah.

19:26.234 --> 19:27.676
I'm sorry, your own name.

19:27.696 --> 19:28.877
P-E-Y-T-O-N.

19:28.897 --> 19:30.338
Mm-hmm.

19:30.358 --> 19:32.460
And he's the, and we're out there training.

19:32.500 --> 19:34.402
I'm throwing about 64 feet in practice.

19:34.482 --> 19:36.103
It was a really good practice throw.

19:36.123 --> 19:37.244
I wasn't a good practice.

19:37.264 --> 19:39.907
I usually threw better meets, which I'm thankful for.

19:40.527 --> 19:45.031
And he says, you can win this thing.

19:45.151 --> 19:45.992
I said, well, they're not.

19:46.394 --> 19:47.506
It was long.

19:47.587 --> 19:48.760
He said, you can win this thing.

19:51.271 --> 19:54.675
It was a fleeting thought but it didn't stick with me very much, you know.

19:54.695 --> 20:02.783
He was a great champion, had never won a gold medal and if he won one he'd probably be the last of his career because he was about to get out of dental school and start a practice.

20:04.425 --> 20:14.336
But after the first round, I'm, and I mean they got these 300 pound East Germans and you know they look different than they did the last time I saw them.

20:14.356 --> 20:17.599
The Russian is big and the Hungarian is

20:17.579 --> 20:23.166
300 pounds and I mean I'm really intimidated a little bit by it all.

20:23.186 --> 20:27.372
And after the first round I'm in about fifth place with like 60 feet.

20:29.355 --> 20:33.220
Then I moved in the second round I moved into third.

20:33.460 --> 20:36.043
Well I got a medal.

20:36.063 --> 20:39.848
And Long and O'Brien and Varhew, the Hungarians enemy.

20:42.192 --> 20:43.333
In the third round

20:45.305 --> 20:52.136
I moved into second, but it's a shaky second.

20:53.698 --> 20:57.404
In the fourth round, and Long is not throwing well.

20:57.424 --> 20:58.585
He's throwing 64 feet.

20:59.026 --> 21:00.709
I mean, it looks like he's got it one.

21:00.749 --> 21:01.670
He's already, you know.

21:02.692 --> 21:11.245
In the fourth round, I threw 65-5.

21:11.849 --> 21:14.693
a new Olympic record and move into first place.

21:15.394 --> 21:16.896
Long gets in and throws terrible.

21:18.258 --> 21:22.063
For a moment, maybe, you know, it's over for the other guys.

21:22.083 --> 21:23.225
O'Brien can't throw that far.

21:23.265 --> 21:24.406
Roddy, you can't throw that.

21:24.587 --> 21:26.189
I can't throw that far, you know.

21:27.270 --> 21:30.935
I get in the next throw and I throw 66-3, a new Olympic record.

21:32.437 --> 21:34.260
And Long throws immediately after me.

21:34.280 --> 21:35.482
He doesn't even walk to the front of the ring.

21:35.522 --> 21:39.227
Steps in and throws 66-8 and it's over.

21:39.287 --> 21:41.670
Neither one of us improved on our last throw.

21:42.376 --> 21:46.042
And I remember him telling me, he said, it's all yours now.

21:46.223 --> 21:48.587
That's what he told me on the victory stand, you know.

21:48.607 --> 21:49.288
It's all yours.

21:50.831 --> 21:51.412
Now you finished.

21:52.213 --> 21:52.354
Second.

21:52.374 --> 21:52.734
Second.

21:53.516 --> 21:54.257
And you're how old?

21:54.818 --> 21:55.178
I'm 19.

21:55.199 --> 21:55.479
19.

21:55.679 --> 21:58.184
What did you feel like up on that?

21:58.204 --> 21:58.885
I felt good.

21:59.366 --> 22:03.473
You know, even though I didn't win, I felt excited and good and...

22:03.453 --> 22:05.737
I was thrilled by it all.

22:05.857 --> 22:09.344
I felt Long was the best shot putter and probably deserved to win.

22:10.346 --> 22:15.876
I think I probably would have felt like I kind of stole it if I'd have won that one.

22:16.497 --> 22:17.599
So I didn't feel bad at all.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.886
Did any family or special friends go?

22:20.906 --> 22:21.647
No one was there.

22:21.627 --> 22:22.950
for that, you know.

22:23.211 --> 22:24.574
This is Tokyo, October.

22:25.657 --> 22:33.456
And during, as you were preparing for all that spring and summer, in fact, who was coaching you?

22:33.516 --> 22:34.118
Was anybody?

22:34.839 --> 22:36.784
Mostly on my own then.

22:36.764 --> 22:54.477
Coach Thomas was willing to do whatever I needed you know to be done and he was a perfect coach for me but he knew what I wanted to do and he created an environment for me that I'm here to help you tell me I'm not going to try to mess you up you know what you want to do.

22:54.517 --> 22:59.346
Now where were you getting you were reading

22:59.326 --> 23:02.332
things and trying to learn all you could.

23:02.393 --> 23:03.194
Where did you learn?

23:03.295 --> 23:06.822
Yeah but most of it I learned in high school with my high school coach.

23:06.922 --> 23:07.864
Is that right?

23:07.884 --> 23:12.795
We studied film together, Dallas Long, Perry O'Brien, Bill Nieder, over and over and over.

23:13.113 --> 23:16.840
Now, was your technique different from anybody else's?

23:16.860 --> 23:17.541
Not too much.

23:17.602 --> 23:22.952
It was a little different in that I was taller and lankier, but then they went through basically the same technique.

23:23.192 --> 23:25.036
I just wasn't near as strong as the other guys.

23:25.737 --> 23:28.382
And you all didn't spin those days.

23:28.402 --> 23:31.628
That's what I thought.

23:31.849 --> 23:36.117
As you are coming home,

23:37.345 --> 23:39.548
What are you dreaming for the future?

23:39.648 --> 23:44.514
Well, I'm already starting to think about, well, you know, well, two things I wanted.

23:44.634 --> 23:50.321
I really felt like at that point in my career, the most important thing to me then was the world record.

23:50.782 --> 23:54.707
That's what I wanted because that meant I was the best.

23:55.648 --> 24:00.894
Now, over the years, I realized that that's kind of a fleeting thing because somebody's going to beat it.

24:01.415 --> 24:04.599
But a gold medal, they can't take away from you.

24:04.819 --> 24:05.580
So...

24:05.560 --> 24:08.403
You know, at that time I didn't see that.

24:08.423 --> 24:16.171
I would have traded, I would have much rather had a world record than a gold medal at that point in my career.

24:16.592 --> 24:17.713
And what was the record then?

24:18.114 --> 24:18.995
The record was 67-10.

24:19.335 --> 24:21.237
And that was Long?

24:21.297 --> 24:21.938
Dallas Long.

24:22.518 --> 24:32.529
And I'd thrown 66-3 and I'd come back in 65 and with an expectation by a lot of people of breaking the record.

24:32.549 --> 24:34.251
So then I had some pressure on me.

24:34.231 --> 24:59.844
Now, didn't you tell me once upon a time that back in high school you went out and kind of worked out on your own by yourself one day, throwing the 16 shot, and one of the assistant coaches or something gave you a little saying you have the capability of being... Well, that was what I was talking about earlier when my high school coach said, when I threw 55 with it, that you could go to the Olympics someday if you work at it.

25:00.425 --> 25:00.525
Yeah.

25:00.505 --> 25:23.188
And didn't you also tell me that one time you went into, when you were in eighth grade or ninth grade, went into the veteran basketball coach's office and here were the photos on the wall of the outstanding players and he said something to you, if you do your best you might be... I don't remember him saying anything to me, but I remember those photographs.

25:23.168 --> 25:31.296
And I looked at them every day when I was a sophomore and junior because you had the All-State players and you looked at the All-State teams as you walked out on the floor.

25:32.600 --> 25:35.490
And one of the first things I did when I had

25:36.348 --> 25:42.236
went back for the first time after being at A&M, is to go back and look at those and they'd taken them down.

25:42.296 --> 25:45.400
The new football coach had decided it wasn't a thing to do.

25:46.341 --> 25:52.229
But I walked and I looked at Gary Griffin who lives here in town, E.J.

25:52.249 --> 25:55.133
McIlvain who lived here a while, worked at ANCO, both of them.

25:55.113 --> 26:00.578
Those athletes were my heroes in walking out on that floor.

26:00.998 --> 26:04.301
It's just something at Pampa that you did.

26:04.382 --> 26:05.783
You looked at those every time.

26:06.544 --> 26:13.170
Am I correct then in guessing that one of the keys for you was setting a goal and working to achieve it?

26:13.190 --> 26:15.992
Well, that's what I liked about the shot put and the discus too.

26:16.012 --> 26:21.317
The shot put is a little easier to set short-term goals and reach them.

26:21.357 --> 26:24.360
I try not to set real long-term ones.

26:24.340 --> 26:29.165
just throw further and just keep moving it out and staying hungry doing that.

26:29.906 --> 26:31.347
And I was pretty much able to do that.

26:31.407 --> 26:38.615
Every day in practice I had a goal to try to accomplish, even though I never threw as far in practice, which I'm kind of thankful for.

26:38.635 --> 26:40.597
I'd hate to throw my best throw in practice.

26:41.578 --> 26:46.343
But every day I'd go out and work at trying to throw further and never meet.

26:46.523 --> 26:48.745
If I had to do it over again, I probably would have

26:49.282 --> 26:52.847
not push myself at each meet.

26:53.488 --> 27:00.378
I would have said, in other words, this early in the season, I'm going to just do a lot of training and not worry about distance.

27:00.398 --> 27:08.629
But after I came back from Tokyo, there was an expectation everywhere I went to throw well, and I felt the pressure of that, a little too much probably.

27:08.769 --> 27:12.755
And then as I approached the 70-foot mark, then there was a lot of pressure.

27:13.756 --> 27:17.922
You had to drop out of school that fall.

27:17.902 --> 27:20.445
Where did you live after the Olympics?

27:20.505 --> 27:21.707
Did you come back to the campus?

27:21.727 --> 27:32.661
No, I came back and my girlfriend, who's now my wife of all these years, was going to school to Abilene Christian.

27:32.962 --> 27:42.895
And so there was an Aggie there that was going to hire me at one of those good paying jobs I never could have.

27:42.915 --> 27:44.517
He was in the oil business.

27:44.733 --> 27:55.232
And when Coach Fullberg found out, he nixed it because he said you get your fingers cut off or something working in the oil field.

27:55.252 --> 28:01.003
So I went to work for West Texas Utilities traveling around with a legendary

28:00.983 --> 28:07.110
a football official by the name of Curly Hayes, who was a great football, basketball official.

28:08.392 --> 28:09.934
And I said, well, what is my job?

28:09.954 --> 28:11.616
And he said, well, you'll find out.

28:11.696 --> 28:14.019
And I thought, well, this is going to be a cush deal riding around.

28:14.199 --> 28:16.962
And he was a great public speaker.

28:17.403 --> 28:18.745
And he did it all off the cuff.

28:19.706 --> 28:21.228
And we'd go to all these towns.

28:21.248 --> 28:25.393
West Texas Utilities was the largest utility company in the world, in the area.

28:26.053 --> 28:30.619
But they had all these small towns like Anson, Texas, and Big Lake.

28:31.375 --> 28:34.419
Abilene's the only big town in their market, I guess.

28:35.640 --> 28:44.150
And he would go out and talk at the Chamber of Commerce banquets and the FFA, FHA and all that, and I kind of rode with him.

28:44.290 --> 28:49.176
I was getting a salary of $100 a week, which is a pretty good deal.

28:49.236 --> 28:52.160
Ours were kind of long because I was riding with him, you know.

28:52.821 --> 28:54.042
Then I started driving.

28:55.152 --> 29:06.229
And one day we drove up to a place there in Anson, the Lions Club at noon, and he said, he called me Jolly Green because he officiated some Pampa games and we wore green, and he called me Jolly Green Giant.

29:07.671 --> 29:08.452
He said, it's your turn.

29:08.512 --> 29:09.113
I said, what do you mean?

29:09.153 --> 29:09.974
I don't have anything.

29:09.994 --> 29:10.896
He said, you don't need anything.

29:10.916 --> 29:12.118
You just get up and tell stories.

29:14.922 --> 29:16.324
I said, I can't get up and talk.

29:16.344 --> 29:17.145
I'm scared to death.

29:17.606 --> 29:20.991
He said, well, you're going to because we're going to go in there and I'm going to introduce you.

29:22.304 --> 29:25.509
And he had me doing before I was three, three or four of those things a day.

29:25.790 --> 29:27.012
I hated them.

29:27.032 --> 29:28.695
I'm mad at him about it.

29:28.935 --> 29:30.438
It was the best thing that ever happened to me.

29:30.879 --> 29:33.523
I never have liked public speaking.

29:33.543 --> 29:39.693
But I got where if I could get up and just talk and not try to make a formal speech, I could get through it.

29:39.834 --> 29:44.862
And in my job, later years, that was one of the criteria that I had to do.

29:45.083 --> 29:46.144
And it helped me out.

29:46.265 --> 29:48.328
And he helped me.

29:48.916 --> 29:56.056
had a whole lot and encouraged me, didn't critique me much, just encouraged me and so it turned out to be a positive experience.

29:56.999 --> 30:02.655
My girlfriend then and I didn't date much and that didn't work out and later did because we married but

30:02.990 --> 30:05.413
So I came on back to A&M ready to go.

30:05.473 --> 30:06.174
All right.

30:06.775 --> 30:09.459
This special young lady, is she from Pampa?

30:09.479 --> 30:10.080
From Pampa.

30:10.100 --> 30:11.261
She was from my high school.

30:11.281 --> 30:11.482
All right.

30:11.502 --> 30:12.864
And so you had known her?

30:12.884 --> 30:13.765
I had known her.

30:13.805 --> 30:15.267
We didn't date in high school.

30:15.287 --> 30:16.208
She's a year ahead of me.

30:16.328 --> 30:17.410
When did you all start dating?

30:17.430 --> 30:19.673
And we started dating when I was a freshman at A&M.

30:19.693 --> 30:20.354
Oh, okay.

30:20.374 --> 30:25.100
She came to an indoor track meet in Fort Worth and came by and said hello to me afterwards.

30:25.140 --> 30:29.867
And then she was going to be in Odessa when we were at the West Texas Relays.

30:29.887 --> 30:30.027
Uh-huh.

30:30.327 --> 30:32.511
And this is a kind of interesting story.

30:34.214 --> 30:35.496
There's an Aggie out there.

30:35.917 --> 30:37.600
They wanted me to come out.

30:37.620 --> 30:39.543
The Aggies, this was all legal in those days.

30:39.584 --> 30:49.922
They wanted me to come out early and talk to a guy named Ross Montgomery, who was a great running back at Midland High School.

30:50.543 --> 30:51.604
about coming to A&M.

30:51.624 --> 30:52.626
He also was a shot putter.

30:52.646 --> 30:53.747
That's why they wanted me to do it.

30:54.428 --> 31:00.695
And they want me to throw the shot exhibition because I'm a freshman.

31:00.715 --> 31:02.137
I can't throw with the varsity.

31:02.217 --> 31:02.918
They won't let me.

31:03.158 --> 31:05.441
So they have an exhibition for me to throw.

31:05.481 --> 31:10.948
So I fly out there and we go to the country club with

31:11.300 --> 31:16.807
and take Montgomery, and he ends up going to TCU and becoming a great professional football player and went to TCU.

31:16.847 --> 31:32.168
I didn't do very well, but there was an Aggie out there named Andrew Elliott, oil business, stayed with him, and I said, you know, well, this girl's coming to Odessa, and we were staying in Midland, and he said, well, take my wife's car.

31:33.790 --> 31:37.455
I said, well, I'd be uncomfortable doing that, and she's going to come pick me up or something, I think.

31:37.495 --> 31:39.478
He said, no, just take her car, you know.

31:40.079 --> 31:41.020
Well, it was a Cadillac.
