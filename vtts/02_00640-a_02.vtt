WEBVTT

00:01.803 --> 00:15.918
I felt were the most important at that time that I 
had something to do with was, first was the

00:01.803 --> 00:15.918
Academy's Committee on Oceanography, which was 
either its second or third committee on

00:01.803 --> 00:15.918
oceanography, I forgot which.

00:19.602 --> 00:25.028
This again was a brainchild, I think, of Gordon's 
and Gordon, Lil, and myself. We'd been putting

00:25.088 --> 00:28.992
together a program in the Navy, a long-range 
program. And we thought there ought to be a little

00:35.274 --> 00:46.586
broader look at this, that

00:35.274 --> 00:46.586
this should be done on a national basis. And we 
thought it would be appropriate to have an Academy

00:46.666 --> 00:51.211
Committee on Oceanography. So I went over and 
talked to John Coleman, who was executive officer

00:51.231 --> 01:00.261
of the Academy at that time.

01:00.697 --> 01:03.723
And I guess Bronk was president of the Academy. And 
Bronk agreed to it. And

01:06.007 --> 01:12.159
the question was who to get as chairman. And John 
Coleman picked up the phone and called Harrison

01:12.199 --> 01:17.990
Brown and asked him if he'd agree to be chairman. 
And he did. And I've forgotten who was on the

01:18.510 --> 01:23.059
original committee, but it was people like 
Columbus Islin and Roger Revelle, Morris Ewing,

01:23.731 --> 01:31.823
Sumner Pike, Harrison Brown. I'm sure there's a 
list of these around. Dick Better would know it.

01:38.293 --> 01:43.621
And when it was established, they invited Dick to 
be its executive secretary. And he's been there

01:43.641 --> 01:44.943
ever since. And that has to be close to 20 years now. 
So it's been going a very long time. And that

01:52.688 --> 01:59.435
committee sat down and spent many months of 
deliberations. And although I was not a member, I

01:59.495 --> 02:06.602
sat in on virtually every meeting as government 
representative. And they put together a thick

02:06.722 --> 02:13.248
report on oceanography. I think it was called 
Oceanography 1960

02:13.268 --> 02:22.257
to 1970 or something like that. And it had a major 
impact on the whole business. I think it was the

02:27.152 --> 02:31.678
guiding thing. I like to think that what we had done 
in the Navy had an impact also. We put together a

02:35.302 --> 02:50.620
program called 10OC, or 10 Years in Oceanography, 
for the Navy, which had a long range projection of

02:35.302 --> 02:50.620
growth in oceanography, new ships, and so on in the 
business. And the Navy stuck to this pretty well.

02:53.658 --> 02:54.839
for most of the 10 years. It essentially became a 
part of the Academy's committee. I think it was

03:01.647 --> 03:18.366
about this time that the administration

03:01.647 --> 03:18.366
or the bureaucracy began to

03:01.647 --> 03:18.366
grow significantly in oceanography. One of the 
things that we found was becoming necessary was

03:22.379 --> 03:31.798
that oceanography was being done not only in ONR, 
but in many agencies of the government. And there

03:32.900 --> 03:34.804
was a need to coordinate this. So we began getting a 
group together that was called the Interagency

03:34.864 --> 03:43.982
Committee on Oceanography, I believe, ICO. At 
first, people got together on the working level

03:44.350 --> 03:54.961
and just tried to plan programs, coordinate 
things, and so forth. And it began to grow, and we

03:54.981 --> 04:03.930
began to get the heads of agencies interested in 
this. And I remember the first day that Jim

04:05.312 --> 04:13.260
Wakeland came on board as Assistant Secretary of 
the Navy for R&D. I went and spent something like

04:14.692 --> 04:26.909
six hours with him and told him all about 
oceanography, what the Navy was doing in it, and

04:14.692 --> 04:26.909
the fact that we'd set up this interagency 
committee. We wanted him to chair it and so on. He

04:29.612 --> 04:35.360
immediately became interested in this, and we 
became pretty good friends.

04:38.945 --> 04:43.551
I think it was about three weeks after that date, 
Eisenhower asked him to brief the cabinet on

04:45.117 --> 04:48.600
oceanography. So he got me to go along with him. And 
it was quite an interesting day. Again, Jim hadn't

04:56.828 --> 05:01.973
been in the Navy very long, so he didn't know much 
about it. But we had a briefing all prepared. And I

05:04.475 --> 05:08.599
sort of went along to answer questions if some came 
up that he couldn't field. And I remember to this

05:08.659 --> 05:14.044
day when Eisenhower walked into the cabinet 
meeting looked down the agenda and he says, oh, I

05:15.475 --> 05:20.361
see we have oceanography on the agenda today. He 
says, where's Morris Ewing? I said, Morris is up in

05:24.186 --> 05:28.571
Columbia where he belongs. He sort of chuckled. It 
was an interesting experience to go through that.

05:36.041 --> 05:37.983
Was Eisenhower sympathetic? Yes, he was. Not much 
came out. It was more of an information type

05:41.768 --> 05:44.892
briefing, You know, oceanography was then 
becoming a word that people were hearing about and

05:45.074 --> 05:50.682
wondering what the hell it meant. So they just 
wanted to find out what was included and what the

05:50.843 --> 05:57.292
country was doing. And it didn't hurt us to go 
there, that's for sure. But again, we were on that

06:02.800 --> 06:12.034
pretty steep part of the budget curve or science 
going up in interest at that time. So you didn't

06:12.094 --> 06:14.878
have to justify things too much. Were you in that 
famous meeting where Spiro Agnew said, what I'm

06:15.348 --> 06:20.095
really interested in is space, and left? No. That 
was the meeting of the, when they set up, I forgot

06:22.379 --> 06:39.465
what it's called now, the council, I guess, that 
had the heads of all the departments and the vice

06:22.379 --> 06:39.465
president chaired, and I suspect that was when he 
walked into that meeting. Humphrey, who preceded

06:40.171 --> 06:43.355
him, was very sympathetic to oceanography. And as 
you know, he was up here and went out to sea with us

06:43.375 --> 06:46.418
for a couple of days. Very bright, interested guy. 
He just followed everything very closely.

06:56.749 --> 07:01.935
I don't know what other committees that were going 
at that time. Oh, one of the subcommittees of the

07:02.115 --> 07:08.322
ICO that I got interested in was... was called 
PIPICO, or at that time was the

07:09.533 --> 07:20.404
Panel on International Participation of the ICO. 
And this group actually

07:20.525 --> 07:38.123
was the group of agencies that got together and 
provided the general government position on

07:20.525 --> 07:38.123
international meetings, and it's still doing it 
to this day. consultant on it, and I get their

07:38.440 --> 07:44.125
material on a fairly regular basis. And I'm still 
very active in this. And this came about because a

07:45.726 --> 08:03.621
meeting that Roger and Roger Lavelle, John Lyman, 
and I went to with UNESCO many years ago decided

07:45.726 --> 08:03.621
that they'd set up a committee on oceanography.

08:07.364 --> 08:08.025
We went to a preparatory meeting in Copenhagen, as 
I recall. And I couldn't tell you the dates on that

08:12.124 --> 08:15.068
now. It must have been in the late 50s.

08:23.878 --> 08:30.525
As a result of that meeting, they set up IOC, the 
Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission,

08:23.878 --> 08:30.525
under UNESCO. I was very active in that for many 
years. And for many years, it was a fairly active

08:36.372 --> 08:46.708
organization that was promoting good science and 
the interchange of information between science.

08:46.728 --> 09:03.595
But as the law of the sea began to raise its ugly 
head, it become more and more involved in

08:46.728 --> 09:03.595
nationalistic types of things, and the law of the 
sea, and spent more of its time trying to

08:46.728 --> 09:03.595
reorganize itself than thinking about 
oceanography. became disillusioned with it and

09:04.368 --> 09:07.531
stopped going to it. But the ICO now, or PIPICO, 
which is part of ICO in our government, was the U.S.

09:09.313 --> 09:22.287
input into that, even at that stage. It still 
maintains its input.

09:28.795 --> 09:31.978
I know this is a rather dumb question, but In terms 
of law of the sea, do you intend to make overtures to

09:33.106 --> 09:48.700
underdeveloped countries and maybe bring them in 
here to Woods Hole or bring oceanographers so that

09:33.106 --> 09:48.700
you can establish the sort of contacts that will 
allow you to do joint oceanography off of, let's

09:33.106 --> 09:48.700
say, places like Chile or Brazil? Oh, actually, 
that's undoubtedly yes. We've done that through

09:53.825 --> 09:59.210
our whole history long before the law of the sea was 
a problem. We've worked with scientists from

10:01.034 --> 10:08.103
other countries and have developed quite close 
relationships, not only developing countries,

10:01.034 --> 10:08.103
but developed countries. And we have a number of 
people that come spend some time here and then go

10:08.224 --> 10:15.013
back and vice versa. Our people go over there. 
We're particularly interested in developing

10:17.095 --> 10:25.827
countries and trying to help them get started.

10:26.650 --> 10:36.748
Of course, we realize one of the side benefits on 
this is if you get to know the people, the chances of

10:26.650 --> 10:36.748
working off their shores with them is much simpler 
if you have somebody to go to that you know there.

10:38.211 --> 10:42.499
But that's been a mode of operation that we've had 
for many years. I see it coming to being more

10:43.661 --> 10:47.067
important in the future. I think the law of the sea 
is really going to finish down to that may be the

10:51.187 --> 10:53.750
only way of doing research. Obviously, I know 
you're not a mystic, but did you anticipate the Law

10:55.011 --> 11:01.758
of the Sea occurring while you were at ONR working 
with UNESCO? Did you have hints that something

11:01.778 --> 11:03.860
like this was going to occur? Oh, there was another 
Law of the Sea conference, as you recall, in 1959, I

11:04.701 --> 11:21.058
think, which they signed the famous treaty that 
set the limits of the 200-meter limit in this far

11:21.376 --> 11:28.783
beyond that that admits to exploitation, as I 
recall, some language similar to this. And the

11:28.963 --> 11:51.045
people that were involved in that, and that was Don 
McKernan and Benny Schaefer, Wib Chapman, and so

11:28.963 --> 11:51.045
on,

11:28.963 --> 11:51.045
were both pushing for a law of the sea and afraid, 
another law of the sea conference, and afraid that

11:51.970 --> 11:52.992
Another one would occur. There was a great 
question in everybody's mind as to timing on when

11:54.093 --> 11:58.761
you should have this. And then it got somewhat 
taken out of people's hands by Pardo's statement

12:00.404 --> 12:14.727
at the UN saying that seabed is a property of 
mankind. And it stirred up a lot of interest.

12:19.561 --> 12:25.149
quite independent of what the scientists wanted 
to do about bringing about a law of the sea

12:19.561 --> 12:25.149
conference.

12:27.953 --> 12:31.238
It got started in UN, and you couldn't stop it if you 
tried. I'm not sure you're ever going to stop it or

12:33.321 --> 12:35.764
it's ever going to get solved. I mean, it's going.

12:40.771 --> 12:46.399
While we're talking about the Illinois, there's a 
very important point I want you to make some

12:40.771 --> 12:46.399
comments on. Instrumentation and the 
development of ocean arms. My impression is that

12:49.210 --> 12:58.402
few agencies contribute quite so much to the 
development and sophistication of instruments

12:49.210 --> 12:58.402
for oceanography as does ONR.

13:01.687 --> 13:02.788
Tell me how you went about that. How did you decide 
to fund new instruments? What sort of proposals

13:07.555 --> 13:09.517
did you receive? What kind of people did you try to 
deal with? Problems you tried to solve? Well, I

13:14.424 --> 13:17.428
think The proposals at that time were not nearly as 
elaborate as they are now. And I think the reason in

13:26.181 --> 13:34.293
part for that is that there were a lot of new ideas. A 
lot of new technology was emerging. And

13:37.057 --> 13:45.390
it was much easier to identify some of these.

13:46.535 --> 13:53.102
I suspect ONR has supported a lot of technology and 
a lot of development technology. It seems to me

13:53.122 --> 14:03.694
that it's hand in glove with doing science so that 
you don't do it for its own sake. Although I know of a

14:03.754 --> 14:10.842
few projects that we undertook that some of them 
I've never been particularly happy with. But we

14:10.883 --> 14:15.748
did undertake them in its technological 
developments.

14:16.505 --> 14:32.569
Again, I think this sort of refers back to an 
earlier point you made, that the decision as to

14:16.505 --> 14:32.569
whether you wanted to invest some of your money 
into equipment or not rested with the people that

14:16.505 --> 14:32.569
were running things. And they felt it made more 
sense to put some money to develop equipment that

14:32.710 --> 14:40.541
would be used by a broad group of people. It went 
that way. And it went that way not because any group

14:44.888 --> 14:55.323
proposed it, but there was a general feeling among 
the whole community that we needed this kind of

14:44.888 --> 14:55.323
equipment. But the people didn't get together and 
put in a single proposal. The feeling was there, so

15:00.490 --> 15:09.583
ONR took the bit in the teeth, set up a group, and 
went out and would run a program like that and get it

15:00.490 --> 15:09.583
going. Now, I'm sure you're aware that... It was 
ONR that got the deep-sea drilling the Glomar

15:15.702 --> 15:23.329
Challenger off. Again, this was a little group in 
our group there. We had a group in ONR called the

15:27.432 --> 15:36.761
American Miscellaneous Society, which started 
in our branch in ONR. And I'm sure you've heard the

15:38.883 --> 15:44.848
story of the famous wine breakfast at Walter 
Monk's. Well, there were a number of us out at

15:46.212 --> 15:49.276
Walter Monk's house. Again, it's hard to put the 
date on this. But we were discussing what are the

15:54.742 --> 16:03.953
new things that need to be done in oceanography. 
And I remember Gordon Lill was there and myself. I

16:07.577 --> 16:14.785
think Betty Bowden from Scripps was there and 
Walter.

16:16.013 --> 16:27.770
The whole idea of the fact that the technology had 
reached a point in

16:16.013 --> 16:27.770
two places. One, that onshore you could drill to 
great depths. They had just drilled a well to about

16:30.694 --> 16:34.459
30,000 feet in Texas. And they were just beginning 
to come out with drilling platforms to drill at

16:36.021 --> 16:39.927
sea. So there was a possibility of marrying these 
two technologies, one deep drilling and drilling

16:40.007 --> 16:45.615
at sea. that maybe you could drill to 30,000 feet at 
sea. And if you could do that, there were all sorts

16:49.288 --> 16:56.036
of interesting scientific problems that you 
could come into. So as a result of this, the

16:56.056 --> 17:04.867
American Miscellaneous Society decided to put in 
a proposal to NSF to support this. And it got

17:04.967 --> 17:07.290
supported for a committee to study it. And I guess 
finally got to be an AMSOC committee of the

17:07.370 --> 17:16.041
National Academy of Sciences for a while that, 
again, a lot of these same characters keep coming

17:16.308 --> 17:20.512
up. Bill Bascom was

17:20.573 --> 17:28.481
head of this group, and they developed plans for 
the Moho. Now, somewhere along the line in

17:29.982 --> 17:38.712
developing the Moho, a lot of divergent views came 
out. There was one group of people that felt very

17:39.132 --> 17:44.678
strongly the way to proceed was to to build a small 
ship and do some sediment drilling, and gradually

17:45.738 --> 17:53.529
build bigger and bigger ships. And as you got 
better, go to deeper depths. There was another

17:58.656 --> 18:09.992
group that felt that the way to do it was to start out 
with the platform that could do the final job, but

17:58.656 --> 18:09.992
started drilling on shallower depths. But you had 
the platform which you were improving all the

18:10.312 --> 18:13.737
time. Harry Hess of Princeton sort of headed the 
latter group, and Hollis Hedberg also of

18:14.847 --> 18:24.258
Princeton headed the former group. And Walter 
Monk was in—well, I'm not sure which group Walter

18:24.378 --> 18:30.886
Monk was in. I think he was in the one that preferred 
going with the smaller ones bigger. But Moho

18:36.873 --> 18:43.200
decided to go the other way, and that was the side 
that I happened to be on in that.

18:46.201 --> 18:51.530
got to the point where they let a contract for 
construction of the platform in San Diego. Then

18:52.672 --> 18:54.815
the other end of it ran into trouble. The Science 
Foundation was letting this out for contract, and

18:55.676 --> 19:01.987
they had several bids on it. And as you recall, 
Lyndon Johnson was president at the time and was

19:03.870 --> 19:11.522
from Texas, and there was a couple of powerful 
congressmen from Texas. And for one reason or

19:11.542 --> 19:13.305
another, the contract ended up in Texas with Brown 
and Root. This got Gordon Allen of Colorado very

19:17.763 --> 19:21.370
unhappy. Apparently one of the other bidders was 
from his state, and so he raised a fuss on this, and

19:21.410 --> 19:32.009
eventually they canceled. And a lot of things were 
happening. The cost was escalating. The cost had

19:36.337 --> 19:37.639
gotten up estimated cost of about $100 million, I 
think, about that time. There was a lot of

19:42.407 --> 19:48.455
discussion about the propriety of the way the 
contract was handled. There was division in the

19:48.475 --> 19:51.319
scientific community on it. And as a result, the 
whole thing collapsed. But a lot came out of it,

19:55.245 --> 20:04.238
because the ocean sediment coring program, 
people agreed that the idea made a lot of sense. So

20:05.119 --> 20:07.002
it sort of backed off. The ocean sediment coring 
with the Glomar Challenger came out of that. On the

20:11.886 --> 20:26.745
other end, all the design work that went into it are 
the things that these semi-submersible

20:11.886 --> 20:26.745
platforms were based on, so the technology was 
utilized by industry on it, and I think None of the

20:27.518 --> 20:29.440
money was really wasted on it. It really spurred on 
the oil industry. Now the oil industry is putting

20:32.643 --> 20:37.627
just so much more money into that than the 
government ever would. But this was kind of a thing

20:37.667 --> 20:44.433
that helped get it all started at the beginning. 
But that whole program started with ONR funding

20:44.453 --> 20:50.939
the early stages of it.

20:54.483 --> 20:57.205
I remember one meeting we had on this that John 
Mecham, the oil man who had, I think, drilled, his

20:58.315 --> 21:13.156
company had drilled a hole to 30,000 feet, came up 
to Washington, and we were out at Bill Ruby's

20:58.315 --> 21:13.156
house, who was in the geological survey in 
Washington. We had a fairly large meeting out

21:15.218 --> 21:27.175
there, 15 or 20 people, but there were some 
interesting people there, and apparently the FBI

21:15.218 --> 21:27.175
had had the whole house under surveillance that 
night. for which nobody ever found out a reason

21:27.982 --> 21:34.232
why.

21:37.416 --> 21:44.247
That was one of the, you know, these are kind of 
examples of the exciting kind of things that O&R

21:37.416 --> 21:44.247
was into at the time. You could do a lot of things 
like this, and these were big step forwards in the

21:45.709 --> 21:52.039
business that they were making. They were 
gambles. But the people were willing to take it and

21:54.948 --> 22:01.975
were willing to put their reputations at stake on 
these. And I think everybody plays the game much

22:01.995 --> 22:05.278
safer now. I want to jump ahead of the story a little 
bit, and I want to drop back. But if you were to list

22:11.064 --> 22:23.537
what you thought to be the technology, the 
instrumentation side of technology, which you

22:11.064 --> 22:23.537
developed the most in your career as 
oceanographer, what would you choose?

22:28.090 --> 22:40.410
During my whole career— During your whole career, 
what instruments were developed which you think

22:28.090 --> 22:40.410
brought the most to the science of oceanography?

22:40.430 --> 22:44.336
Well,

22:40.430 --> 22:44.336
that's a tough one. I think one couldn't help but 
say the computer. That wasn't developed for the

22:50.382 --> 23:00.612
oceanographer or by the oceanographer, but 
that's been probably the biggest tool he's used,

22:50.382 --> 23:00.612
because everybody uses it in one form or another.

23:04.956 --> 23:20.271
I think the current meters and the arrays of 
current meters that have been developed here have

23:04.956 --> 23:20.271
been a very significant part in understanding the 
oceans.

23:21.280 --> 23:28.429
I think seismology

23:21.280 --> 23:28.429
has made some big changes.

23:32.214 --> 23:34.978
Let me say one thing about the geophysical 
measurements at sea. Some of these had never been

23:36.460 --> 23:45.993
made at sea before, and people like Morris Ewing 
and Morris Ewing started seismic measurements at

23:36.460 --> 23:45.993
sea. I think that Scripps started the magnetic 
measurements,

23:51.284 --> 23:58.892
Warzel gravity measurements, and Bullard and I, 
the heat flow. When these were first made, they

23:59.513 --> 24:01.895
were very difficult to make. But as soon as you 
began making them, you found out they were much

24:02.956 --> 24:07.601
easier to make in the ocean than on land. And very 
rapidly, you develop more information about the

24:08.742 --> 24:14.128
ocean floor than you have about the land. And since 
the geology of the ocean floor is simpler than the

24:14.268 --> 24:21.055
geology of the land masses, We've been able to 
understand the geology of the Earth primarily

24:21.777 --> 24:28.186
because you've developed all of these 
geophysical tools that you can use at sea. And this

24:29.067 --> 24:39.322
has probably been the most significant thing that 
has happened in oceanography during my history,

24:29.067 --> 24:39.322
is what we've learned about the sea floor, plate 
tectonics, sea floor spreading, and so on. And

24:40.003 --> 24:51.058
it's come about from the simple fact that 
geophysical measurements, once you learn to make

24:40.003 --> 24:51.058
them at sea, you can get them in vast quantities 
very fast thereafter, and you get a much better

24:40.003 --> 24:51.058
picture of it. And I think all the technology 
that's gone into those has been tremendously

24:52.523 --> 24:58.172
important. Now, the second question actually 
relates to that. You've led into it in a different

25:03.540 --> 25:04.942
way. I need for you to say a few words about you and 
Bullard's work in the heat wave flow, because

25:04.962 --> 25:11.433
that's very important to the history of 
oceanography. How did you get interested in it?

25:12.534 --> 25:14.097
What do you think its significance was? How did you 
intellectually develop it? What problems did you

25:16.881 --> 25:18.143
face? Well, I got interested in it very simply. As I 
mentioned earlier, I by chance happened at

25:21.617 --> 25:30.489
Scripps the same time as Teddy Bullard had come to 
spend a year there to work on heat flow. I knew

25:31.551 --> 25:33.754
nothing about it prior to that time.

25:37.278 --> 25:43.827
What had happened is that there had been something 
of the order of two dozen measurements of heat flow

25:37.278 --> 25:43.827
that had been made at on land, particularly in 
mines and in boreholes, where they measured the

25:44.296 --> 25:51.888
temperature at different depths and calculated 
the heat flowing out of the earth. But that only

25:54.151 --> 26:00.300
represented kind of a small fraction of the whole 
earth. And you had 2 thirds of it the oceans that

26:00.561 --> 26:04.026
there were no measurements for. So it was critical 
to see what the heat flow was in the oceans. The main

26:09.322 --> 26:23.174
driving force behind this is that we knew that the 
continental rocks were more acidic and they

26:09.322 --> 26:23.174
contained rocks that had higher contents of 
potassium and radioactivity in them. And it was

26:24.676 --> 26:35.526
generally felt that the heat that was flowing from 
the earth was generated primarily by the decay of

26:24.676 --> 26:35.526
radioactive material in the crust of the earth 
about 30 kilometers. And the rest was from the

26:38.650 --> 26:39.931
original cooling of the earth. Now, we knew under 
the oceans that the crust was thinner, and we knew

26:41.633 --> 26:56.367
that the material had less contact with 
radioactivity, so we anticipated that the heat

26:41.633 --> 26:56.367
flow would be smaller under the ocean, but we 
wanted to really find this out. And in 1950, when we

26:57.768 --> 27:04.114
got our first measurements, it turned out it 
wasn't so. All the early measurements showed that

27:04.254 --> 27:07.257
we were getting roughly the same heat flow in the 
ocean floor as was measured in the continents. An

27:16.852 --> 27:30.285
interesting thing about the early heat flow 
measurements was that on the Capricorn

27:16.852 --> 27:30.285
expedition that I went on, we picked up a pattern of 
heat flow that showed normal values in most areas.

27:30.345 --> 27:36.231
But as you approached a ridge, you found that the 
heat flow was very high on the ridge. three to four

27:37.055 --> 27:39.758
times the normal heat flow. And then as you went off 
the ridge, it went back to normal, and then it went a

27:40.639 --> 27:49.910
little below normal and then back to the normal 
values. And this pattern was found in the very

27:49.930 --> 28:01.864
earliest measurements of something like 30 
measurements that were made, and now there's

27:49.930 --> 28:01.864
something like 3,000 measurements, which is just 
borne out this pattern. Of course, we found a lot of

28:06.219 --> 28:14.148
different things, but the main pattern of heat 
flow was found by the very early measurements,

28:06.219 --> 28:14.148
actually. In my early work, we were thinking there 
were convection cells under the ocean floor. Dave

28:23.118 --> 28:27.463
Griggs at UCLA and other people had thought in 
terms of convection cells. And when we detected

28:28.253 --> 28:40.325
this high heat flow over the East Pacific rise, we 
thought that this was an upwelling of heat coming

28:28.253 --> 28:40.325
up from a convection cell. And I actually 
postulated maybe it was the way continents were

28:41.606 --> 28:53.518
formed, that you had this material come up, and it 
gradually built a lot of it up, and it made a new

28:41.606 --> 28:53.518
continent. which of course was not correct, but 
the whole idea of it being on a convection cell has

28:54.528 --> 29:01.915
turned out to be true. The convection cell just 
goes all the way over to the edges. As a matter of

29:06.679 --> 29:24.535
fact, on our early measurements, we made 
measurements of the heat flow between the East

29:06.679 --> 29:24.535
Pacific rise and South America there, and we got 
high heat flows on the rise, and they went down low

29:06.679 --> 29:24.535
to very low under the trench, which is the pattern 
that you would expect from a convection cell. I

29:25.831 --> 29:34.058
think this has been one of the key parts in coming up 
with the whole study on plate tectonics. It's not

29:34.179 --> 29:41.065
the whole thing, or it's not a critical one, but 
it's that compared with the magnetics, the

29:34.179 --> 29:41.065
seismic, the gravity. It's when you put the whole 
works together, the picture began to emerge, and I

29:41.705 --> 29:55.838
know a lot of people have tried to set a date when 
plate tectonics was born or seafloor spreading,

29:41.705 --> 29:55.838
and I think that's probably not a It's a thing that 
has evolved over many years, and a lot of

29:56.915 --> 30:00.999
measurements. It was just putting a lot of pieces 
together, and finally somebody got a key piece in,

30:01.039 --> 30:06.244
and you could see the picture on it. But it was a lot 
of work of a lot of people that developed that. And I

30:11.589 --> 30:15.413
like to think that the heat flow was one of the 
important factors in it. At least it was the first

30:16.554 --> 30:20.718
heat flow at sea, in any case. And I think it was 
significant.
