WEBVTT

00:02.663 --> 00:06.071
Did y'all share candidly your opinions with each other?

00:08.678 --> 00:13.129
Well, probably not completely, but we had a pretty good

00:14.307 --> 00:19.473
working relationship, and yeah, we talked quite a bit.

00:20.594 --> 00:35.490
My secretary in those days was Hillary Gaines, and she had been secretary for Ed Cooper for some time, and she was truly outstanding.

00:35.530 --> 00:42.778
She kept me out of lots of trouble, and so that was a real,

00:43.906 --> 00:50.454
plus having her and she certainly knew what was going on and she certainly had a good relationship with Nelda.

00:51.655 --> 00:55.339
And so I knew, I feel that I knew what was going on.

00:57.021 --> 01:02.668
There is a gigantic mystery there, but I'll never find the answer to it.

01:05.912 --> 01:11.398
But I resigned for two reasons.

01:12.847 --> 01:13.568
from the position.

01:13.608 --> 01:41.217
First of all, when I was hired to go up there, I handled a lot of the dean of student type responsibilities, because we had Dean Hennigan, and he had long passed the understanding of the young people, and I think Dr. Williams understood that, knew that, and was just sitting around waiting to make a change.

01:41.197 --> 01:49.347
And so he needed somebody in the office who could help with those student-oriented type problems.

01:49.367 --> 02:06.867
And so when I went up there in 72, I worked with student government, I worked with student leaders, and Kent Caperton, who was not a student at that, and Kent was assistant, staff assistant in the president's office when I went up there.

02:06.847 --> 02:13.155
And but of course he was at the age of the students or just a little beyond.

02:13.215 --> 02:24.270
And so we worked with students and tried to resolve some of the problems that normally would be handled by a dean of students or vice president of students.

02:25.311 --> 02:29.777
And then I was on the search committee for vice president when Dean Hennigan retired.

02:31.159 --> 02:34.423
And then we brought

02:34.403 --> 02:38.891
John Colas in, in 73, I believe.

02:40.774 --> 02:41.255
I believe so.

02:41.716 --> 02:42.397
I think so.

02:42.417 --> 02:51.232
And so then the next year, I worked with John, and as he got his operation going, and I worked pretty closely with him on, on things.

02:51.312 --> 02:55.399
And then, when he was on board and had things, his staff,

02:56.797 --> 03:01.138
One of them was in my wife, I mean, he hired Carolyn right away.

03:02.303 --> 03:05.659
And so the only thing left of the job

03:06.584 --> 03:16.198
was the secretary to the academic council, which I thoroughly enjoyed, and then just odd jobs around the office.

03:16.859 --> 03:20.584
And certainly the part of the job I enjoyed was working with the students.

03:21.425 --> 03:29.737
And so I went in to see Dr. Williams in the fall of that year and told him that I thought that it was time for me to move on.

03:29.757 --> 03:31.780
And he agreed.

03:31.980 --> 03:35.545
And so I stepped down January of

03:35.525 --> 03:44.685
and Roger Miller, who I had hired to come in to replace Kent, then took over.

03:45.567 --> 03:48.994
He could handle all of the things that I

03:49.885 --> 03:59.557
could have handled for that job and didn't really like handling football weekends and all that stuff that I really never liked but had to do as part of the job.

03:59.577 --> 04:03.161
And so that's the reason that I resigned.

04:04.943 --> 04:12.352
But another reason was Dr. Williams got negative about me for some reason that I have never figured out.

04:12.372 --> 04:15.736
And I'll tell you, I don't know, maybe it was serious, I don't know.

04:15.796 --> 04:17.158
I didn't stay around to find out.

04:17.780 --> 04:28.856
Because I had a very nice relationship with him after I left the office and after I get past this negative I'll come back to that.

04:30.659 --> 04:34.184
But I took a trip with Clyde Freeman one time.

04:35.105 --> 04:40.733
We went in the King Air and we went up to visit Tom Parsons and the cadets at Fort Riley.

04:42.704 --> 04:44.447
Tom Parsons and I got along great.

04:44.527 --> 04:49.494
We were good buddies and he and I joked and raised all kinds of things together.

04:50.015 --> 04:57.907
I got off that airplane and I said something to Tom Parsons and I thought, oops, Clyde Freeman heard that.

04:59.350 --> 05:00.291
Oh, I shouldn't have said that.

05:02.093 --> 05:06.517
And very soon after that, Dr. Williams got rather cold towards me.

05:07.998 --> 05:20.269
I cannot for the life of me remember what it was I said, but I just, I would bet you anything that Clyde went back and told Jack Williams something that I'd said that Jack Williams did not like.

05:20.309 --> 05:23.132
I'm shaking my head.

05:23.212 --> 05:25.194
I have no idea, but I wouldn't be surprised.

05:25.214 --> 05:26.035
I have no idea.

05:26.135 --> 05:32.100
I've asked Nelda about it, and she can't recall anything, or if she does, she won't tell me.

05:32.080 --> 05:41.804
Based on your work in that office, what did you come to feel were the guidelines that Dr. Williams expected?

05:42.205 --> 05:44.250
What did he expect out of his staff?

05:44.568 --> 05:50.197
Oh, he expected you to do your own thing, but to do it competently.

05:51.439 --> 05:52.521
I had a lot of freedom.

05:52.541 --> 05:54.624
Did he expect people to be candid with him?

05:54.965 --> 05:55.766
Oh, absolutely.

05:56.167 --> 05:56.708
Absolutely.

05:56.828 --> 06:06.904
I mean, that's one of the real failings on this campus is too many people say what they want, what you think they want to hear, and no, no.

06:07.045 --> 06:10.390
I think he wanted it, and there's only one time that I

06:11.247 --> 06:16.195
I might should have pulled some punches or something, but maybe I did.

06:16.235 --> 06:16.996
I've really forgotten.

06:17.016 --> 06:20.161
But you remember we had the old radical come and talk?

06:22.124 --> 06:23.486
Oh, he was furious about that.

06:23.807 --> 06:26.471
He was furious.

06:27.873 --> 06:28.935
Who was it?

06:30.434 --> 06:32.237
Radical?

06:32.257 --> 06:32.817
Yeah.

06:33.839 --> 06:43.453
Skona invited him, and the board members raised Cain, and Jack Williams asked them to uninvite him.

06:43.473 --> 06:48.179
And so then a student group on campus invited him.

06:49.241 --> 06:50.062
Oh, what's his name?

06:51.023 --> 06:51.985
Well, we'll think about it.

06:52.005 --> 06:53.607
Yes.

06:54.608 --> 06:58.534
I can almost say it, but it was the

07:00.623 --> 07:14.965
from the 60s and might have been even Kunzler, Kunzler, Kunzler, Kunzler, something like that.

07:15.005 --> 07:15.546
Something like that.

07:15.626 --> 07:17.869
Yeah, yeah.

07:18.570 --> 07:26.522
And he got furious and just ran in the face mad at one of the students, which I really didn't.

07:27.564 --> 07:29.787
I mean, he was just a poor innocent kid not knowing

07:29.767 --> 07:36.781
But no, I think we were all fairly candid with him.

07:37.242 --> 07:41.731
Describe a typical day routine for him.

07:42.313 --> 07:43.675
What time did he get there?

07:43.755 --> 07:46.020
What happened when and how?

07:46.000 --> 07:49.324
He was there fairly early in the morning.

07:49.344 --> 07:53.649
I don't think he got there before 8, but I don't think so.

07:54.110 --> 07:55.952
But that's not the part that impressed me.

07:55.972 --> 07:56.493
He was there.

07:56.593 --> 07:58.655
He was in meetings, meetings, meetings, meetings.

07:59.756 --> 08:02.460
But then he'd load up that briefcase and go home.

08:02.740 --> 08:04.822
He did a lot of work at the office at the house.

08:05.844 --> 08:15.315
And then when he'd come in in the morning, he'd open that briefcase and there'd be tape after tape after tape and stack correspondence that he'd dump on Nelda's desk.

08:15.295 --> 08:20.744
And so he worked all the time, worked a lot at home.

08:20.764 --> 08:28.336
And am I correct that most of the mail was turned around and the answer was out in 24 hours?

08:28.476 --> 08:30.159
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

08:30.419 --> 08:33.724
He reacted to correspondence immediately.

08:35.447 --> 08:37.891
And what did he enjoy most?

08:38.512 --> 08:40.375
What were his pleasures?

08:41.502 --> 08:43.666
Well, outside the office, golf, of course.

08:44.828 --> 08:49.337
And I'm sure you've heard the story or read the letter from the handball player.

08:49.718 --> 08:52.123
Have you heard that story?

08:52.143 --> 08:57.172
Well, I was in the office one day.

08:57.533 --> 08:58.515
He got this letter.

08:59.997 --> 09:05.368
from somebody who enjoyed handball, and it went on and on about all the money we were spending on the golf course.

09:06.430 --> 09:15.089
And it finished up by saying, Dr. Williams, I truly do wish that you were a handball player.

09:15.109 --> 09:20.520
Something like that.

09:20.500 --> 09:21.222
office.

09:21.302 --> 09:24.111
What caused him to smile most?

09:24.131 --> 09:25.695
Oh, I think his interaction with students.

09:26.417 --> 09:28.042
He did enjoy being around students.

09:28.062 --> 09:30.730
He said often that

09:31.823 --> 09:36.591
If you don't love the students, you don't, you don't, you should not be at a university.

09:36.991 --> 09:39.996
And I think he really believed that and lived that.

09:40.016 --> 09:40.897
So he enjoyed that.

09:41.979 --> 09:43.862
It frustrated him to interact with faculty.

09:44.603 --> 09:50.373
I remember part of my responsibility is to set up these meetings, monthly meetings, on Thursday.

09:51.174 --> 09:55.080
Every Thursday we'd meet with a student group.

09:55.060 --> 09:57.804
Maybe the first Thursday of the month, we'd meet with student groups.

09:57.824 --> 10:04.273
Second Thursday of the month, we'd meet with the directors, Tease and all those.

10:04.313 --> 10:05.976
Jarvis was one of them.

10:06.196 --> 10:09.521
Another Thursday, we'd meet with faculty.

10:09.721 --> 10:13.086
Another Thursday, we'd meet with, I don't remember what.

10:13.066 --> 10:25.527
So we'd bring the kids in and they're all, and they've got this, they want to talk about this, and then bring the directors in and they'd have serious financial problems and this and that.

10:25.547 --> 10:28.972
Then we'd bring the, oh, the one was the deans.

10:29.173 --> 10:37.066
You would have been there with that group, the deans and the vice presidents, and talk about the academic problem that brought the faculty in.

10:37.086 --> 10:39.630
All they wanted to talk about was parking.

10:39.610 --> 10:41.613
It's the only thing they wanted to talk about.

10:41.633 --> 10:43.515
They bitched about parking.

10:44.617 --> 10:45.958
We quit having the meetings.

10:45.979 --> 10:51.226
He got so frustrated over the first couple of meetings with the faculty that he just quit having them.

10:51.246 --> 10:52.127
Who wrote his speeches?

10:53.789 --> 10:54.770
That's easy.

10:54.790 --> 10:55.111
He did.

10:55.431 --> 10:59.677
And were they prepared completely?

10:59.957 --> 11:00.358
Oh, yes.

11:00.378 --> 11:02.561
Verbatim in advance?

11:02.581 --> 11:03.963
Or did he work with just notes?

11:06.005 --> 11:09.550
No, I think they were fairly complete, but I really don't remember.

11:09.530 --> 11:22.129
I know he carried them in a loose leaf binder and I know they were not, he certainly didn't type them out and read them if that's what you mean, no.

11:23.110 --> 11:29.800
But they were extensive notes and his speeches were delightful.

11:32.064 --> 11:38.473
Do you remember being present or do you remember any thoughts about what

11:39.517 --> 11:45.643
were for him some of the most enjoyable speeches or presentations that he made?

11:46.563 --> 11:49.366
Do you remember some where you thought that he really?

11:51.248 --> 11:52.449
No, no.

11:54.731 --> 11:56.793
I was at a couple that I know he didn't enjoy.

11:56.833 --> 11:59.255
Such as?

11:59.275 --> 12:09.304
There was some controversy over one of the board members, the black board member from Houston, and he was at a faculty meeting.

12:10.887 --> 12:18.215
And he stood in front of the faculty and he said, what was the board member's name, do you remember?

12:23.400 --> 12:23.460
No.

12:23.480 --> 12:38.076
And he said that Dr. Robinson, it's close but that's not the name, is the most perceptive member of the Board of Regents

12:39.592 --> 12:44.338
And I have yet to praise the board.

12:44.358 --> 12:52.870
Everybody I talked to thought that he had just complimented the Board of Regents and the board member.

12:53.651 --> 12:54.772
And he had not.

12:56.574 --> 12:59.999
For, I'm asking your opinion here.

13:00.620 --> 13:08.350
The board members that Dr. Williams worked with, who do you think were his favorites and otherwise?

13:08.330 --> 13:19.318
I know his least favorite, his least, I don't have to think for a name, but the building that's at an angle over here, Dooley Bell.

13:20.733 --> 13:22.335
Dooley Bell drove him up the wall.

13:23.216 --> 13:32.548
Dooley Bell, well this of course is leaving out his real enemy on the board, Peyton McKnight, but Dooley was just a nuisance.

13:32.568 --> 13:46.845
And Dooley, at least Dr. Williams thought Dooley would come up here and just snoop around campus and wander in, talk to people who didn't know who he was, and then go harass Dr. Williams about it.

13:47.226 --> 13:48.327
Have you heard those stories?

13:48.982 --> 13:54.749
I don't know if he did or he didn't, but Dr. Williams thought he did.

13:56.991 --> 14:11.428
His favorite board members, I think he got along well with Ford Albritton and the chairman of the board.

14:11.408 --> 14:12.390
From Mineral Well.

14:12.410 --> 14:12.891
Clyde Wells.

14:12.911 --> 14:13.553
Clyde Wells.

14:13.613 --> 14:16.860
I thought they worked together well.

14:17.982 --> 14:27.342
And see, the McKnight thing started when the board went to Tennessee to interview Dr. Williams.

14:27.322 --> 14:32.449
And McKnight couldn't go because he had a legal business commitment that he couldn't undo.

14:32.569 --> 14:33.270
Is that right?

14:33.290 --> 14:42.943
And they agreed, so this is Fort, my source is Fort Albritton, that they, after interviewing Dr. Williams, eight of the board members agreed that this is it.

14:43.283 --> 14:43.524
Really?

14:43.724 --> 14:48.190
McKnight was furious that they dared make a decision without him.

14:48.210 --> 14:49.151
Is that right?

14:49.552 --> 14:50.232
Yeah.

14:50.493 --> 14:55.219
And what did Dr. Williams do to unwind, to relax?

14:55.199 --> 14:57.081
Goff, I think.

14:58.863 --> 15:05.631
He would occasionally just call somebody and go out and shoot a round of Goff.

15:07.393 --> 15:13.781
Who do you think he listened to most closely outside the office?

15:13.801 --> 15:15.363
Who on the campus or anywhere else?

15:15.443 --> 15:20.869
No, I think Dr. Calhoun certainly.

15:21.592 --> 15:36.833
and Dr. Calhoun, and I think he leaned heavily on Clyde Freeman for anything to do with financial situation, but I think

15:38.973 --> 15:45.684
At least from my perspective, Dr. Calhoun was, he was close, confident.

15:47.828 --> 15:53.617
Did you ever go to Austin to any legislative hearing or anything like that with him?

15:53.978 --> 15:54.098
No.

15:54.118 --> 15:54.759
Okay, so you didn't.

15:54.859 --> 15:55.460
No.

15:55.480 --> 15:58.365
In fact, you mentioned this young man, Kent Caperton.

15:58.345 --> 16:01.413
I believe I didn't know who he was.

16:01.493 --> 16:04.542
Describe him and what he did at the office.

16:06.266 --> 16:12.102
Kent, of course, was the student body president in the early 70s.

16:12.233 --> 16:15.138
He was the president at the time Williams was inaugurated.

16:15.679 --> 16:16.120
That's right.

16:16.260 --> 16:16.581
That's right.

16:16.601 --> 16:18.304
He spoke for the students and I spoke for the faculty.

16:18.324 --> 16:18.644
That's right.

16:18.845 --> 16:19.906
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

16:20.648 --> 16:21.269
I remember now.

16:21.389 --> 16:21.950
I remember now.

16:23.433 --> 16:36.756
But Kent was a bright young man, student body president, and then went off to Austin to the

16:39.352 --> 16:41.254
The Lyndon Johnson School over there, didn't he?

16:41.274 --> 16:42.035
And didn't like it.

16:42.977 --> 16:48.083
And so then he wanted to quit, and he did quit, and then Dr. Williams hired him back as staff assistant in the office.

16:48.964 --> 16:51.147
And so then he was back on campus.

16:51.928 --> 16:53.751
I didn't see him much.

16:54.872 --> 17:05.166
I had known him when he was a student, a little bit I guess, but I'm not remembering why.

17:07.208 --> 17:08.650
Let's see.

17:10.773 --> 17:14.959
He must have been about class of 70 then.

17:14.979 --> 17:17.983
So I guess I just, I don't know.

17:19.064 --> 17:20.506
I believe it would be 71.

17:20.667 --> 17:20.747
71.

17:20.967 --> 17:21.788
Yeah, I believe you're right.

17:21.808 --> 17:22.028
71.

17:22.048 --> 17:23.370
Yes, yes.

17:23.631 --> 17:24.492
Because that was the fall.

17:24.512 --> 17:25.974
The fall, the inauguration was in the fall.

17:25.994 --> 17:26.134
Yeah.

17:26.575 --> 17:27.636
So 71.

17:28.097 --> 17:32.863
And then I worked with him for about a year, I guess, when he was staff assistant.

17:32.883 --> 17:33.925
Then he went off to law school.

17:34.646 --> 17:34.846
All right.

17:34.866 --> 17:36.869
When he was staff assistant, what did he do?

17:37.930 --> 17:39.953
Oh, he did all kinds of things.

17:40.895 --> 17:46.845
little odd jobs that Dr. Williams wanted done, and he'd run errands around campus.

17:48.227 --> 17:52.554
He'd drive Dr. Williams' car and get it washed.

17:52.655 --> 18:01.770
He'd do all kinds of little things like that, as well as more important things that he would work with the students and some things.

18:01.790 --> 18:05.075
Did you all think he had a high capability?

18:05.576 --> 18:06.818
Oh yes.

18:06.798 --> 18:07.960
No, no.

18:10.183 --> 18:14.149
It was really fun working with him.

18:14.189 --> 18:17.114
He was a nice young man.

18:17.374 --> 18:23.944
Now then, there is the story that I'm sure you've got there somewhere about the $5,000 check to the student body.

18:25.306 --> 18:26.187
If you don't, you need it.

18:26.368 --> 18:29.032
I don't remember that one.

18:29.052 --> 18:32.637
When Dr. Williams became the president,

18:34.017 --> 18:50.021
He and Tiger and Wyse were over at the house, Tiger being Teague, Tiger Teague, and the students marched on the home.

18:50.041 --> 18:50.602
Do you remember that?

18:51.764 --> 18:53.266
To welcome them.

18:53.286 --> 18:54.608
To welcome them.

18:55.027 --> 18:59.552
Well, those were the days when students were marching on president's homes all over the country.

18:59.572 --> 19:03.397
And so this made the newspapers.

19:03.417 --> 19:09.705
And somebody out there, not an Aggie, I don't think an Aggie, decided that was just great.

19:11.006 --> 19:16.252
Wrote a check out for $5,000 and sent it to Dr. Williams and told him to spend it on the students.

19:18.155 --> 19:23.481
So Dr. Williams thanked him, turned around and wrote a memo to Kent.

19:23.950 --> 19:26.933
I said, Kent, I got $5,000.

19:27.033 --> 19:30.156
I want the student government to tell me how they want to spend.

19:30.176 --> 19:35.060
Student government went through two months of hell, arguing about spending it here.

19:35.161 --> 19:44.950
So, Kent wrote a letter back to Dr. Williams and said, Dr. Williams, the student government has decided we want the money spent for this purpose.

19:44.970 --> 19:50.515
And, sir, if you get another check for $5,000, please decide yourself how to spend it.

19:51.187 --> 19:53.774
See, now that's a good anecdote.

19:53.814 --> 19:55.018
That's a good one.

19:55.038 --> 19:55.800
You hadn't heard that.

19:55.820 --> 19:57.465
No, I don't believe that last part.

19:57.485 --> 20:02.860
I don't believe I had heard.

20:02.880 --> 20:04.825
What have we not covered about Dr. Williams?

20:05.246 --> 20:06.951
Because, see, we don't...

20:06.931 --> 20:16.306
We don't have enough in this current domain, not enough people know about him and his importance.

20:17.207 --> 20:20.112
Well, two somewhat trivial things.

20:20.252 --> 20:23.778
The first two things he did when he came on the job, you know what they were?

20:25.521 --> 20:26.262
Doesn't mean a bell.

20:26.843 --> 20:31.310
First, he shut off the whistle that blew at 8 o'clock, 12 o'clock, 1 o'clock, and 5 o'clock.

20:32.071 --> 20:34.575
Number two, he fired Andy Suttle.

20:35.213 --> 20:38.237
The first two things he did on the job.

20:38.257 --> 20:41.000
Seidel was the vice president for research.

20:41.020 --> 20:41.961
Right.

20:42.622 --> 20:52.033
And there was probably not a single person on the campus who would not applaud that decision.

20:53.054 --> 20:53.235
Right.

20:53.935 --> 20:57.820
As far as you're aware, why did he cut off the whistle?

20:57.840 --> 21:01.204
Oh, it just wasn't appropriate for a university campus.

21:01.943 --> 21:12.202
What I had heard is some individual, some lady, or some faculty member complained that it was like being a... Is that right?

21:12.222 --> 21:12.422
Yeah.

21:12.442 --> 21:13.504
It was like a factory.

21:13.745 --> 21:15.788
I had not heard that.

21:15.808 --> 21:17.792
Now, on the other hand, there were

21:17.772 --> 21:27.766
families who lived within sounding distance of the campus who used that as a kind of an alarm clock for their children.

21:28.047 --> 21:35.237
When the whistle blows, it's time for you to get home, wash your face and hands, and get ready for supper.

21:35.377 --> 21:37.721
But it was a new thing.

21:39.523 --> 21:44.050
What was the effect of Dr. Williams on this institution?

21:45.177 --> 21:47.559
Well, I think great.

21:48.600 --> 21:55.848
He was the president that transitioned us from General Rutter, which I think we needed transition.

21:56.588 --> 22:06.739
General Rutter had gotten us through the times that a general officer could carry us through, and then it was time to break the mold.

22:07.259 --> 22:13.986
We wanted the outside world to perceive us as a university, not as an old military school that was still struggling.

22:13.966 --> 22:18.290
And Dr. Williams was a true scholar.

22:19.051 --> 22:34.785
He had all the right credentials, and he had the background, the academic background, the knowledge of what a university was all about, and knew what was important.

22:35.065 --> 22:40.490
And I think he has, he set the stage.

22:40.510 --> 22:43.433
He built the foundation for what has come since.

22:43.565 --> 22:50.957
That's what I tell people, that academically he laid the foundation.

22:52.560 --> 22:57.087
If you reverse them chronologically, neither one would have done well.

22:57.408 --> 22:58.570
No, no, no, no.

22:58.590 --> 23:04.780
Oh, no, they would have run Dr. Williams out of town, as they would have

23:05.941 --> 23:11.968
David Morgan or.

23:11.988 --> 23:14.831
Did you ever hear him talk about his military experiences?

23:16.333 --> 23:17.354
No, no, no.

23:17.374 --> 23:18.976
He was extremely.

23:19.897 --> 23:20.378
Only.

23:20.398 --> 23:26.906
But he had a very, very splendid admirable record in the Pacific and so on.

23:27.066 --> 23:27.807
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

23:27.827 --> 23:32.252
Did y'all, those of you in the office, did y'all work very much with Mrs. Williams?

23:33.025 --> 23:34.987
Only Nelda, only Nelda.

23:36.549 --> 23:39.392
I didn't work with her at all.

23:40.613 --> 23:59.472
Nelda worked with her and all the functions and things were worked out between Nelda and Mrs. Williams and the people who worked over in the home.

23:59.519 --> 24:03.086
All right, I'm not going to ask the negative on this now.

24:03.367 --> 24:12.124
Of the deans, for those of you and Dr. Williams, who do you think were the outstanding deans of that time?

24:12.144 --> 24:12.845
Oh, who were they?

24:13.046 --> 24:15.250
Let's see, I knew them all in those days.

24:16.664 --> 24:22.813
Hubert, Maxwell, Prescott, Kunkel, Shelton.

24:23.935 --> 24:26.078
No, Shelton came on later.

24:26.639 --> 24:27.861
He comes in during.

24:27.881 --> 24:33.869
Yeah, he comes in during, but Mack's next door neighbor was the dean in those days.

24:35.031 --> 24:36.834
Oh, Slick Al Price.

24:37.074 --> 24:38.416
Al Price, yeah.

24:39.898 --> 24:46.468
But the deans, I thought that

24:47.596 --> 24:51.101
that he worked well with most of the deans.

24:51.201 --> 24:59.452
I know that Maxwell drove him crazy, just being too subservient.

25:00.614 --> 25:10.667
Maxwell was a very subservient type person to the president, and I don't think Dr. Williams liked that.

25:10.647 --> 25:18.960
At least he indicated to me that some things had led me to believe he didn't get care for that, but he seemed to get along fine with Maxwell.

25:18.980 --> 25:21.063
He just gave me comments.

25:21.403 --> 25:23.627
As a group, it was a comparatively capable.

25:23.987 --> 25:30.377
Yes, they were and all worked together, as far as I could tell, reasonably well.

25:30.357 --> 25:31.839
And what about Coldus?

25:35.483 --> 25:38.206
I think that they worked very well together.

25:39.307 --> 25:41.290
Of course, Dr. Williams chose him.

25:42.491 --> 25:57.208
And what I have always been amused at is Dr. Williams had a committee looking for that individual, and there was a guy named Brian who the students on the committee fell in love with.

25:57.577 --> 26:04.406
And they were adamant that they had, that Dr. Williams had to choose Bryant.

26:04.426 --> 26:08.152
And when Dr. Williams chose Coltis, they were shocked.

26:08.172 --> 26:10.134
They were appalled.

26:10.154 --> 26:15.522
And it took Coltis about one day or two to win them over, but one was Barb Sears.

26:17.605 --> 26:20.589
And of course, they would deny that to this day.

26:20.629 --> 26:23.753
They would deny that because they all fell in love with Coltis after that.

26:24.188 --> 26:25.730
How did he locate?

26:26.731 --> 26:28.594
How did he identify a coldest?

26:28.614 --> 26:29.014
Do you know?

26:29.575 --> 26:30.736
He was at East Texas State.

26:31.597 --> 26:32.438
Yes.

26:32.458 --> 26:36.383
And I don't know if he knew him before all this started or not.

26:36.484 --> 26:40.669
But he, we had a number of applications come in.

26:41.910 --> 26:53.385
And I read through all the applications and this guy, Brian, had impressive credentials.

26:56.673 --> 27:10.090
So whether Dr. Williams knew about him at East Texas, is that where he was, or whether he'd heard about him over the years or what, I don't know.

27:10.831 --> 27:19.682
But there was no question who the vice president for students was going to be because he made up his mind.

27:19.722 --> 27:24.688
He listened to everybody, and then he said it's going to be this way, and then he hired him.

27:24.668 --> 27:28.593
This young lady you mentioned, Barbara Sears, describe her and identify her.

27:30.015 --> 27:30.896
She was a fireball.

27:30.916 --> 27:40.388
Of course, there were not many women around in those days, and she was a very, very bright, very energetic, very active young lady.

27:40.409 --> 27:41.790
I saw her just last year.

27:41.810 --> 27:43.452
She came back to campus for something.

27:43.793 --> 27:45.135
Have you seen her since those days?

27:45.555 --> 27:46.156
I saw her.

27:46.176 --> 27:49.160
That same day?

27:49.420 --> 27:50.001
Yeah.

27:49.981 --> 27:54.086
And she was a very active student.

27:54.546 --> 27:56.769
She's the first student body officer female.

27:57.129 --> 27:57.590
Is that right?

27:57.610 --> 27:58.571
She was the secretary.

27:59.172 --> 28:00.033
Okay.

28:00.053 --> 28:01.234
What do you know about her father?

28:02.175 --> 28:02.475
Nothing.

28:02.756 --> 28:06.860
A truly, truly, truly world-class plant geneticist.

28:07.021 --> 28:07.381
Oh, really?

28:08.142 --> 28:13.508
He probably deserves credit for increasing the world's production of wheat by

28:14.872 --> 28:16.054
Twenty, thirty percent.

28:16.234 --> 28:17.817
Is that right?

28:17.837 --> 28:19.059
At Missouri.

28:19.079 --> 28:20.381
Oh, great, great, great.

28:20.421 --> 28:21.483
He died while I was there.

28:21.743 --> 28:22.845
Is that right?

28:22.865 --> 28:24.568
But Ernie Sears, everybody.

28:25.329 --> 28:25.510
Really?

28:25.530 --> 28:27.553
Respectfully, deeply, deeply, deeply.

28:27.573 --> 28:28.475
Is that right?

28:28.495 --> 28:29.236
So she came.

28:29.717 --> 28:36.508
Now, among things I've never asked her that I sometime got to, what led her to come down here?

28:36.488 --> 28:41.394
Because she, if I'm not mistaken, she's a biochemist today.

28:41.414 --> 28:43.737
I believe she ended up in biochemist.

28:43.777 --> 28:45.760
I mean, a plant geneticist.

28:45.780 --> 28:52.208
I think she came down here to do similar work to what he had been doing.

28:52.228 --> 28:52.849
I see.

28:52.869 --> 28:53.149
I see.

28:53.169 --> 28:53.309
I see.

28:54.531 --> 28:54.891
Let's see.

28:55.792 --> 29:03.422
Were you there when Dr. Williams appointed Bob Walker to be the development?

29:03.442 --> 29:05.044
If so, how did he?

29:08.956 --> 29:09.777
I don't remember.

29:11.741 --> 29:12.783
Who was before Bob?

29:15.588 --> 29:16.469
Dorsey McCrory.

29:17.731 --> 29:18.292
Oh, no.

29:18.633 --> 29:21.838
Then Bob was already there by the time I got there.

29:21.858 --> 29:32.517
Because we used to chuckle that McCrory took every contribution that anybody slid under the door or threw over the transom.

29:32.497 --> 29:41.393
Well, what is your, looking back, what is your evaluation of the quality of the appointments that Dr. Williams made?

29:42.435 --> 29:47.925
Oh, I thought they were very good.

29:50.049 --> 29:50.590
Let's see.

29:54.215 --> 29:55.097
There were some of them.

29:55.117 --> 29:55.879
Of course, Colas.

29:56.662 --> 29:57.123
Calhoun.

29:58.547 --> 29:58.887
Walker.

30:00.131 --> 30:00.512
Walker.

30:00.572 --> 30:03.279
But what was Calhoun before?

30:03.339 --> 30:04.823
Was he the dean?

30:04.843 --> 30:07.330
He was over in the system.

30:07.377 --> 30:08.258
Was that where he was?

30:08.278 --> 30:08.378
Okay.

30:08.398 --> 30:11.281
He had been in the Kennedy administration.

30:11.321 --> 30:12.623
He had gone to Washington.

30:13.844 --> 30:15.126
He'd been dean of engineering.

30:15.166 --> 30:23.134
Then he came back and he was at the system level as a kind of a vice chancellor or something or other for engineering, but it was kind of a nebulous.

30:23.154 --> 30:23.995
Okay, yeah.

30:24.015 --> 30:26.458
And so he made him an academic vice president then.

30:27.239 --> 30:32.845
It must have been very shortly after he got there because I just wasn't aware of when this transition was.

30:32.825 --> 30:37.831
was there, I think it was, he was the academic vice president briefly.

30:38.071 --> 30:38.732
No, Byers.

30:38.792 --> 30:39.973
I mean, Horace Byers.

30:39.993 --> 30:40.714
Byers, yes.

30:42.075 --> 30:42.476
I see.

30:42.496 --> 30:48.162
He was there, he was, when Williams came in, Byers was the academic vice president.

30:48.182 --> 30:53.628
Briefly, and he retired, and as far as I know it was congenial.

30:54.349 --> 30:56.031
I see.

30:56.011 --> 31:02.120
All right, one of the, you mentioned all of those letters Dr. Williams wrote.

31:02.561 --> 31:07.668
Also, to me, one of his special features was writing little notes to people.

31:10.492 --> 31:17.803
How did he, did anybody give him suggestions of who needed a pat on the back or were those all self-generated?

31:18.885 --> 31:20.668
Best I can tell, they were all self-generated.

31:21.469 --> 31:23.031
I don't know.
