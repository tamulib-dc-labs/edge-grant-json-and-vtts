00:02.360 --> 00:05.805
And Barbados, British West Indies. Donald 
Ouellette, interviewing Art Shields, January

00:06.165 --> 00:14.297
1st, 1983, in New York City. Mr. Shields, when and 
where were you born? Well, I just told you. Maybe it

00:23.289 --> 00:24.351
wasn't recorded. Barbados, British West Indies, 
October 31, 19... Oh, 1888. Yes. And when did you

00:35.647 --> 00:38.272
immigrate to the United States? Well, I didn't 
immigrate. My parents were American citizens. We

00:42.780 --> 00:49.933
moved to another island, and I came to the States in 
93.

01:02.283 --> 01:03.084
in 1893. When was the first time that you became 
interested in journalism? That again is gone into

01:12.191 --> 01:15.314
quite fully in the book.

01:21.399 --> 01:31.868
I was working as a full-time reporter for several 
months in 1909 on a little daily paper in a steel

01:32.793 --> 01:38.619
town in Ohio, Dover, Ohio, a U.S. steel town. And 
then the paper folded and I went back to college.

01:52.493 --> 01:54.114
That's all in the book. I have a whole chapter in 
that first year, first journalism

02:02.408 --> 02:08.915
When did you become involved with the Daily 
Worker? Well, when it started in 1924. And what was

02:11.537 --> 02:14.740
your position then? Reporter. And what was your 
beat? Well, the

02:19.705 --> 02:25.411
beat was a very small staff. The beat was all 
Chicago.

02:32.480 --> 02:36.486
In your earlier years, you knew John Reed? Well, I 
say I told you before I met him. Oh, no, that wasn't

02:40.392 --> 02:41.554
recorded. I met him and talked with him, but I knew 
his work better than I knew him personally.

02:51.789 --> 03:01.103
I heard him speak quite a number of times and, of 
course, read what he wrote.

03:01.724 --> 03:09.178
starting in

03:01.724 --> 03:09.178
Seattle, even before that. No, I began reading 
John Reed in 1913,

03:09.679 --> 03:22.242
his article in the Masses on the Silk Strike in 
Paterson, New Jersey. It's a fascinating It can be

03:25.568 --> 03:37.321
found in a book called The Education of John Reed, 
which is a compilation of a lot of these articles

03:25.568 --> 03:37.321
published by International.

03:39.864 --> 03:48.935
And I heard him lecture two

03:39.864 --> 03:48.935
or three times before the World War. And, of 
course, I read the masses and read his articles. He

03:53.640 --> 03:54.681
was one of the editors.

03:59.116 --> 04:03.161
When did you know Big Bill Hayward? Well, yes, I 
knew Bill, I wouldn't say intimately, but I met him

04:03.321 --> 04:14.415
several times and went to his meetings. I have a 
chapter about him, or

04:15.316 --> 04:22.966
partially about him, in the book. It's on this 
Patterson Silk Strike of the IWW in 1913. I was a

04:29.643 --> 04:32.807
reporter in New York, not on labor. I was covering 
crime then.

04:39.375 --> 04:44.902
But in my free time, because of my interest, I would 
run over to Patterson during the strike. And I

04:46.925 --> 04:49.348
heard him speak. Well, I heard him speak at other 
times also. He was a tremendous speaker, a

04:53.873 --> 04:56.697
tremendous figure. Did you know, were you 
associated in any way with, say, the Molly

04:58.600 --> 05:04.327
Maguires? Well, the Molly Maguires, you'll 
flatter me, I'm not quite that old. Did you know

05:10.554 --> 05:13.138
Mother Jones? I knew Mother, I once had a two-hour 
talk with Mother Jones, a luncheon, and of course I

05:13.999 --> 05:27.595
followed her work closely, yes. Incidentally, 
Philip Foner will have a book on Mother Jones

05:28.165 --> 05:41.841
coming out, The Historian, I suppose you know the 
name, in four or five months, maybe earlier. It's a

05:41.901 --> 05:45.405
900-page book. He's collected everything that 
Mother Jones has said that was recorded.

05:53.335 --> 05:57.800
And...

05:57.820 --> 05:58.020
Excuse me. When you were

05:58.405 --> 06:08.658
with the Daily Worker, or in the 19-teens, what was 
your politics then? And where? Before the war.

06:12.022 --> 06:12.743
Before the war? Yes. What was your personal 
politics? Before the First World War? Yes, sir.

06:16.248 --> 06:28.243
Well, before the First World War,

06:16.248 --> 06:28.243
I was left with a...

06:29.995 --> 06:37.063
I was particularly interested in the IWW, but I 
didn't join it until just after the war. How long

06:39.185 --> 06:42.349
were you a member in the IWW? Probably three or four 
years.

06:50.158 --> 06:54.042
How did you first become interested in maritime 
labor? What were your first contacts with the

06:55.063 --> 06:57.606
scene? I was very much interested in labor, per se, 
and

06:58.447 --> 07:20.623
particularly labor in the major industries, and

06:58.447 --> 07:20.623
I would say probably most actively since 1916. I 
have a chapter in my book about a trip I took in 1916

07:21.532 --> 07:40.069
on a British freighter through the submarine zone 
to England, and

07:21.532 --> 07:40.069
I would say that my interest was much more active 
after that trip. Did

07:40.109 --> 07:45.194
you ever know Andrew Fursweth? I've heard him 
speak. I didn't know him personally, no. Of

07:51.232 --> 08:03.227
course, when I heard him speak, I heard him speak at 
an American Federation of Labor convention in

07:51.232 --> 08:03.227
Atlantic City in 1925.

08:05.810 --> 08:11.137
He had become somewhat of a figure of the past. You 
see, Furiseth did very good work in his day for the

08:19.987 --> 08:21.669
men on the deck for seamen. He was essentially a 
craft unionist and he played quite a part. He came

08:30.118 --> 08:32.781
out of the old sailing ships. He played quite a part 
in organizing the sailors union of the Pacific.

08:41.451 --> 08:48.238
Later his union tried to expand and took the title 
of the ISU, the International Seaman's Union.

08:57.878 --> 09:18.546
But I think the old man rather lost control then 
because there were departments for the engine men

08:57.878 --> 09:18.546
and for the stewards and they were led by 
conservatives and

09:19.775 --> 09:25.384
It didn't reflect much credit on him to be 
connected with, but he himself was a very honest

09:19.775 --> 09:25.384
man.

09:28.288 --> 09:30.251
What you'd call a good man, I'd say. Senator La 
Follette once, the elder La Follette, in the

09:31.574 --> 09:42.030
speech, paid a great tribute to Furiseth. He gives 
Furiseth credit for the first real protective

09:47.500 --> 09:57.349
laws for seamen, the seamen's

09:47.500 --> 09:57.349
protection, I think it was called the Seamen's Act 
or something like that. La Follette helped

09:57.769 --> 10:02.133
himself put it through in consultation with 
yours. That was much earlier. I don't remember the

10:03.995 --> 10:05.536
date anymore. 1915. Yes. But that could be looked

10:09.920 --> 10:15.145
up. But his weakness, in a way, was partly due to the 
fact that he was not really an industrial

10:15.597 --> 10:23.910
unionist. And industrial unionism is the thing. 
To

10:29.839 --> 10:43.680
fight against these great corporations 
controlled by bankers, the old-fashioned craft

10:29.839 --> 10:43.680
union of separate unions for the different 
skills, with many of the workers having very

10:44.673 --> 10:51.022
little skill, is obsolete, you see. As a young man, 
what

10:52.945 --> 11:04.000
made you want to become involved and become 
socially aware? Well, I had a lot of experience

11:05.282 --> 11:14.595
working, and

11:05.282 --> 11:14.595
if you work and go through the hardships. And you 
see how helpless a worker is against a giant

11:19.411 --> 11:24.437
corporation. For instance, I worked for U.S. 
Steel in this little town where I finally got a job

11:24.457 --> 11:32.966
on the newspaper. And I worked for other big 
corporations. You want to do something about it.

11:42.356 --> 11:44.278
And if you're a sympathetic person, You enjoy the 
society of the men you're working with. Their

11:52.946 --> 11:58.732
anger and their sufferings impinge on you, too. I 
mean, the natural reaction is to do something

12:00.334 --> 12:05.320
about it and get together and struggle.

12:08.183 --> 12:09.945
You said that you... ideologically adhered to the 
Wobblies, the IWW, up until a couple of years after

12:10.381 --> 12:16.407
World War I? Well, it was a slow development

12:17.228 --> 12:24.716
there. From the Wobblies, where did you 
politically move to? You see, the labor movement

12:27.539 --> 12:39.392
was weak in those days, and

12:27.539 --> 12:39.392
I was feeling my way. There. There wasn't too much 
guidance.

12:46.398 --> 12:49.201
And ideologically, which way were you moving? 
What's that? Which way were you moving? From the

12:52.724 --> 12:56.908
Wobblies, you ideologically moved where? Next? 
Well, I say the Wobblies were industrial

12:57.669 --> 13:02.513
unionists. Perhaps you'd better have something 
to eat, if you're thinking. The Wobblies were

13:07.378 --> 13:09.480
industrial unionists, you see. That's what 
attracted me. They

13:14.100 --> 13:25.073
had some weaknesses too, of course, which is one 
reason why they didn't survive. But

13:25.915 --> 13:31.481
they were great fighters in their day. From the 
Wobblies, where did you move on to next? What? From

13:37.589 --> 13:40.092
the Wobblies, where did you move to next 
ideologically? I would say, as far

13:41.050 --> 14:07.440
as labor is concerned, somewhat broader, 
realizing that

13:41.050 --> 14:07.440
the Wobblies cannot do it all by themselves, that 
they're also, even in the craft unions, there were

13:41.050 --> 14:07.440
many good fighters. There were also bureaucrats 
and and some traders, but there were many good

14:10.514 --> 14:14.618
fighters in the ranks. And also, in the craft 
unions, there was developing a move towards unity

14:15.599 --> 14:25.188
between them. And in others, broadly speaking, it 
was a movement towards industrialization,

14:25.348 --> 14:32.575
towards industrial unionism. William J. Foster 
played a big part in that. He did a tremendous job,

14:36.599 --> 14:39.762
which you're probably familiar with, in 
organizing the packinghouse workers. Do you know

14:43.161 --> 14:44.322
about that? Somewhat, yes. Well, that was in 18,

14:46.624 --> 14:55.432
perhaps starting in 17. He had to work with craft 
unions. But what he did was to formed

15:01.898 --> 15:09.225
shop councils, plant councils, of the craft 
unions so that there would be a centralized

15:09.728 --> 15:16.415
control there. And it was so effective that they 
quickly organized almost the entire

15:17.256 --> 15:32.792
packinghouse industry, 200,000 workers, and got 
contracts. Unfortunately, after the war, Foster

15:39.344 --> 15:45.492
was no longer in it because he went next into steel 
and other things. But unfortunately, after the

15:46.493 --> 16:01.954
war came a violent attack on all labor by the 
employers, by the big interests. The unions were

16:01.974 --> 16:04.337
beaten down. They lost half their membership in 
the next few years. But you know, I think you're

16:09.837 --> 16:11.880
familiar with that. Did you cover the maritime 
strike of 1920-21? Well, it

16:15.364 --> 16:26.799
continued through the first half of the 20s, this 
destruction of the unions. Even the mighty coal

16:27.500 --> 16:36.672
miners' union was on its last legs by 27. Though it 
rose again, it came back in a big way a few years

16:37.327 --> 16:43.054
later. You said you became or was employed with the 
Daily Worker when it was first founded in 1924. And

16:53.266 --> 16:54.868
how long did you stay with the paper? Well, I was 
there less than a year. Then I went to, it became, my

16:56.910 --> 17:05.781
wife and I, took over the New York office of

17:06.402 --> 17:16.676
a trade union news agency called the Federated 
Press. It lasted about 20 years, though I was only

17:18.058 --> 17:24.587
with it there for several years. And that was owned 
by, organized like the Associated Press on a

17:25.789 --> 17:35.042
cooperative basis. And there are about 100 labor 
papers, including a few socialist and communist

17:35.714 --> 17:47.104
papers among them, but most of them trade union 
papers. And that gave me the opportunity to travel

17:48.225 --> 17:56.532
widely and

17:48.225 --> 17:56.532
covering big struggles. For instance, I'm now 
writing about a chapter

17:58.114 --> 18:05.080
on a you may not have heard of it, the Battle of Blair 
Mountain in West Virginia. It was the biggest arms

18:12.255 --> 18:20.045
struggle between labor and trade unionists and 
gun thugs in the country's history. Far bigger

18:21.126 --> 18:24.591
than anything else that's ever happened in this 
country. What union was? United Mine Workers.

18:28.716 --> 18:30.258
Thousands of men on each side. What was the date on 
this? What? When? Twenty-one. Starting at the end

18:35.350 --> 18:55.179
of August and continuing into September, there 
was a six-day gun battle with a minimum of 5,000

18:35.350 --> 18:55.179
miners and at least that many gun thugs and state 
police were also with them.

18:57.943 --> 18:59.665
The miners were winning. There were a good many 
casualties among the gun thugs, not so many among

18:59.685 --> 19:04.412
the miners. And the miners were winning when the 
army came in, 2,000

19:05.287 --> 19:20.964
troops in battle gear, and the men didn't attempt 
to fight the troops.

19:22.046 --> 19:35.040
As Mother Jones said to me, she was down there, the 
troops are the reserve gunmen for the coal

19:22.046 --> 19:35.040
operators. President Harding was President 
then.

19:41.540 --> 19:45.626
What were some other labor incidents that you 
covered? Well, there was a succession of mine

19:47.929 --> 19:49.951
struggles. A few months later, there was a, let's 
see, about three months later, I was in Kansas for

19:52.254 --> 20:05.652
about five weeks. The coal fields there, a big 
strike. The president and vice president were

20:10.601 --> 20:18.748
jailed altogether for 18 months, and the miners 
struck to free them. Then the next year, I spent

20:19.689 --> 20:24.633
three months in Pennsylvania. There was a 
five-month national strike of the miners, the

20:25.854 --> 20:32.239
longest national strike they ever had. And I spent 
three months in it. That was quite exciting.

20:44.460 --> 20:53.613
After you helped form this Labor Federated Press, 
how long was it until you went back to the Daily

20:44.460 --> 20:53.613
Worker? Well, I didn't go back until 1936. Until 
1936. Yes. Before this time, had you ever covered

21:02.485 --> 21:06.351
the waterfront areas as a journalist or as a 
reporter? Yes, but not consistently. Just

21:17.898 --> 21:19.421
occasional stories. Because there wasn't very 
much, there was activity, some activity among the

21:19.461 --> 21:35.325
longshoremen, but the struggle of the seamen in 
the big way didn't begin until the formation of the

21:36.166 --> 21:48.241
Marine Workers Industrial Union, which was, in a 
way, the mother of the National Maritime Union. I

21:48.561 --> 21:49.763
suppose you know about that. Right. Did you 
personally know Roy Hudson? Yes, I knew Roy

21:55.510 --> 21:57.272
Hudson, yes. He died, as you know. The last month, 
yes. Yeah. Did Esther Palazzi give you the latest

22:05.545 --> 22:08.068
issue of that paper, yes. She certainly did, yes. 
Yes. Well, that's quite informative

22:10.291 --> 22:17.759
in that. In 1936, you were given the waterfront as 
your territory, as a reporter for that? No, not

22:24.087 --> 22:26.350
fully.

22:29.153 --> 22:29.994
Just occasionally. I wasn't the main 
correspondent of the waterfront.

22:35.600 --> 22:41.789
I should say 1940, but I was in touch with it, a 
fairly close touch. I spent a good deal of time then

22:43.652 --> 22:52.064
in the steel drive, the organizing of the steel 
union and other things, yes. Would you like to

22:54.187 --> 23:00.055
elaborate more about the Steel Organizers 
Committee?

23:04.237 --> 23:09.082
I suppose you know the story of the CIO. Yeah. It was 
first a committee for industrial organizations.

23:17.830 --> 23:24.476
Then it became, in 1938, the name was changed to 
Congress of Industrial Organizations. You see,

23:24.496 --> 23:32.083
first it was a committee because it was a committee 
set up by... I believe, eight different unions.

23:37.511 --> 23:53.109
And then

23:37.511 --> 23:53.109
it started to

23:37.511 --> 23:53.109
encourage

23:37.511 --> 23:53.109
drives in many industries. The biggest one was in 
steel. John L. Lewis played a great historical

23:58.556 --> 24:02.340
role in that. His role historically was very bad in 
the 20s. I suppose you know about that. He was

24:08.957 --> 24:11.640
reactionary. Under his leadership, the

24:12.781 --> 24:17.907
union fell to pieces. But

24:18.988 --> 24:23.673
he made a remarkable change. His personality 
didn't change, but his tactics changed. As he said

24:30.661 --> 24:32.243
to me, I interviewed him the beginning of January 
36,

24:32.392 --> 24:45.886
I

24:32.392 --> 24:45.886
asked him something like this. I said, the United 
Mine Workers is now at the peak of its strength.

24:51.292 --> 24:53.374
It's never been so strong as today. Why are you 
going into this larger program? And he said in his

24:59.040 --> 25:01.723
booming voice, My motives are not entirely 
altruistic, he said. Then he explained that the

25:05.120 --> 25:15.316
miners' union could not survive if it stood alone. 
He said the same interests are behind steel and

25:15.336 --> 25:28.858
some other industries as are behind the steel

25:15.336 --> 25:28.858
industry. employers of the coal miners. So it was 
necessary to get a very broad front of strong

25:33.592 --> 25:41.081
unions. And he showed real statesmanship. He 
realized that the left, particularly the

25:47.570 --> 25:57.462
communists, had great influence, had much 
influence, Their organization in steel was not

25:57.914 --> 26:02.962
big, but their men were trusted. Their 
representatives were trusted. And he

26:06.788 --> 26:16.183
didn't himself take direct charge of the drive. He 
entrusted it in the hands of Philip Murray, vice

26:16.203 --> 26:20.629
president of the miners' union. But he set the 
overall policy.

26:26.602 --> 26:35.516
They put a total of about 60 members of the 
Communist Party on the payroll.

26:40.524 --> 26:48.196
Not a high payroll, rather low, but enough to live 
on with necessary expenses. They weren't the only

26:49.438 --> 26:53.284
organizers, but I would say there were If not the 
core of the organizing drive, they were the most

26:54.310 --> 27:00.818
important part of it. And they did the job. They 
organized the steel industry. It was necessary to

27:08.387 --> 27:11.531
have a strike in 1937 then. U.S.

27:11.551 --> 27:21.583
Steel, you see, signed up in March 1937.

27:23.369 --> 27:41.150
But the Bethlehem and Immense Steel Republic and 
others held out, and a strike was called against

27:23.369 --> 27:41.150
them, which lasted several months. It was not won 
officially, but it was such a demonstration of

27:42.271 --> 27:51.942
solidarity that the company signed up. soon after 
the one after the other and the major plants with

27:52.276 --> 28:20.173
the exception I think perhaps of National Steel 
and a few others were were unionized I made my

27:52.276 --> 28:20.173
headquarters then in Pittsburgh during that 
drive and radiated out from there Well, let me ask

28:20.997 --> 28:22.018
you this. You stated earlier that in the 1920s the 
organized labor movement declined. Why do you

28:31.428 --> 28:32.830
think it came up again? What were the reasons why 
labor expanded in the 30s, in your opinion?

28:42.640 --> 28:49.367
Well, there are a number of reasons.

28:51.203 --> 29:15.912
One was that the

28:51.203 --> 29:15.912
big employers were very greedy, and

28:51.203 --> 29:15.912
they beat workers down, their working class down, 
and the workers had all they could take, and all

28:51.203 --> 29:15.912
that was needed was good leadership to advance. 
Now, this leadership had begun even before the CIO

29:16.685 --> 29:26.194
drive, here and there, in a number of places. There 
were a number

29:27.295 --> 29:46.573
of union groups that started winning strikes, and 
a big role was played by a number of left unions such

29:47.482 --> 29:55.970
as the Marine Works Industrial Union, which were 
in the main led by communists. I would give them a

29:57.892 --> 30:00.755
great deal of credit in this. And as a matter of 
fact, before Lewis acted, a young communist steel

30:02.316 --> 30:13.607
worker, Gus Hall, you know the name, He led a big 
delegation of steel workers. He was a steel worker

30:18.108 --> 30:22.593
himself, to Washington to see Lewis. And they told 
him that he would get the fullest support if he

30:23.895 --> 30:37.132
would put

30:23.895 --> 30:37.132
the resources of the United Mine Workers behind a 
steel drive. Lewis did it. He might have done it

30:41.144 --> 30:51.259
anyhow, but I think that that was probably the 
spark plug that started it. Do you feel there were

30:51.279 --> 31:09.987
any other— Hull himself became in

30:51.279 --> 31:09.987
charge of the drive at a rather important town 
called Warren, Ohio, near Youngstown, where

30:51.279 --> 31:09.987
there was a big Republic Steel plant. besides this 
new leadership, do you think there are any other

31:11.671 --> 31:21.581
reasons why labor expanded in the thirties? Do you 
think Roosevelt? Yes, definitely yes. The

31:28.648 --> 31:32.271
political atmosphere was much better for it. You 
see, Roosevelt

31:41.033 --> 31:43.796
started out very cautiously. He himself 
developed a lot during the first years of his

31:45.938 --> 31:52.304
administration. But in his NRA, National 
Recovery Administration,

31:53.605 --> 32:06.818
most of it was not good. It was sort of giving a 
charter to to the monopolies to take control. But

32:17.841 --> 32:30.833
there was one little clause headed under the title 
7A that

32:17.841 --> 32:30.833
workers had the right to organize, and that must be 
recognized. Now Lewis again showed

32:32.695 --> 32:36.639
statesmanship of that in 1933. His

32:36.719 --> 32:41.263
union was almost at the bottom. And his chief 
economist, Jet Lauch, he's forgotten now, but he

32:44.293 --> 33:02.153
was once rather important, told me that Lewis bet 
his last

32:44.293 --> 33:02.153
quarter of a million dollars in the treasury on an 
organizing drive then. And he set organizers all

33:03.314 --> 33:08.820
through the coal fields.

33:10.454 --> 33:12.696
telling them, the government is behind you. He 
somewhat exaggerated that. But it was very

33:15.920 --> 33:17.702
effective. The workers were just looking for 
leadership, you see. They were in terrible

33:21.066 --> 33:24.209
condition. The misery in the coal fields was 
extremely acute. And they swarmed into the

33:28.614 --> 33:30.456
unions. And the United Minebrookers shot up 
quickly.

33:39.277 --> 33:53.036
Just before that, you see, there had been a 
left-wing miners' union called

33:39.277 --> 33:53.036
the National Miners' Union, also NMU. But

33:53.116 --> 34:09.098
when the United Miner Workers was hardly 
functioning at all, they conducted one very big

33:53.116 --> 34:09.098
strike and some smaller ones. They dissolved and

34:10.310 --> 34:24.226
went back into the United Mine Workers Union and 
threw their progressive outlook into the locals.

34:25.267 --> 34:38.562
And that went along with Lewis's

34:25.267 --> 34:38.562
drive, his quarter of a million dollar gamble, 
which paid off wonderfully well. And that's when I

34:39.487 --> 34:44.935
was so successful that I said to him, your union is 
now at the peak of its strength. But he said he was

34:46.357 --> 34:52.586
afraid it wouldn't last unless they organized the 
other unions.

34:56.392 --> 34:58.235
The leadership plays a great part there. When 
workers are practical, they'll fight if they see a

34:58.335 --> 35:09.291
good chance of winning.

35:10.621 --> 35:12.583
And they were desperate, you see. In 1936 you were 
associated with the Daily Worker? Well, at first I

35:19.412 --> 35:28.042
gave all my time to the Sunday Worker, which had 
just been started. But after that I worked

35:29.324 --> 35:39.396
for—after a few months I was on general assignment 
for the Daily. but concentrating mainly on labor.

35:45.234 --> 35:51.484
When was the first time that you began to associate 
with the seamen in the 1930s? You said you first

35:53.187 --> 35:59.237
went to the steel, covered the steel strikes. I did 
occasional assignments, you see, there. And I had

36:02.161 --> 36:04.405
friends among the seamen. So I kept, in the 
personal way, I kept in touch with it, yes. I knew

36:10.730 --> 36:11.912
what was going on. For instance, I knew some of the 
leaders of the Marine Works Industrial Union very

36:11.952 --> 36:19.626
well. There

36:19.686 --> 36:24.594
were some very good men there. Harry Hines, Al 
Lannan, Roy I didn't know quite as intimately, but

36:31.402 --> 36:40.791
I knew him and saw him from time to time, and others.

36:44.875 --> 36:55.426
They

36:44.875 --> 36:55.426
worked

36:44.875 --> 36:55.426
on almost an empty stomachs at the early days. It 
started, I think, One of the articles on Roy in

37:00.072 --> 37:07.261
Esser's paper, little paper, tells about it. 
First was organized a social club. That was

37:11.287 --> 37:18.797
organized by communists, and women played quite a 
part in that. But that became the basis of, rather

37:21.040 --> 37:29.050
soon, of the Marine Workers Industrial Union, 
which became an effective union of thousands of

37:29.519 --> 37:32.942
members.

37:35.585 --> 37:40.810
Not as big as the NMU itself became, but a very 
significant union. When did you begin to cover the

37:42.832 --> 37:48.437
waterfront in more detail? Well, I began giving a 
large, not all my time, but I should say a large part

37:48.457 --> 37:57.045
of my time to it. It was part of my beat. I would say in 
1940 there.

38:07.774 --> 38:15.463
Did you cover any of the earlier strikes of the NMU 
in 36 and 37 or the tankers? Well, I wrote some

38:15.484 --> 38:23.113
stories, but other people were doing more work 
there than I did. But I knew about it, you know, and I

38:24.074 --> 38:27.859
was in on it. Why was the Daily Worker so interested 
in the National Maritime Union? What was it

38:33.602 --> 38:35.345
interested in? Why did the Daily Worker give the 
National Maritime Union so much space? Well, the

38:40.532 --> 38:44.598
Daily Worker is devoted to worker struggles, you 
see. And it's a New York paper. It's national also.

38:50.626 --> 38:56.935
But maritime is the biggest and most important 
industry in New York. It's heavy industry. It's

38:58.313 --> 38:59.615
big industry, you see. And so they couldn't escape 
it to do their job.

39:09.505 --> 39:15.432
By 1940, then, you were covering the National 
Maritime Union in the seafront area. What's that?

39:17.214 --> 39:20.037
When was the first time that you met Joe Curran?

39:25.079 --> 39:26.220
I don't remember. I'd met him earlier, but I didn't 
have much to do with him. I

39:30.486 --> 39:41.040
saw him frequently, though, after 1940.

39:44.865 --> 39:48.870
What were your impressions of him as a person? Or 
what are your impressions of him as a person?

39:55.420 --> 39:57.462
I was sort of open-minded about him. He didn't 
overwhelm me at all. And he was the president of the

40:02.347 --> 40:12.639
union, so I

40:02.347 --> 40:12.639
accepted that, or you might say supported him. But

40:12.679 --> 40:23.250
I didn't see him as a thinker, especially. Not that 
he wasn't stupid, but he was not creative, I would

40:23.618 --> 40:29.463
say.

40:33.007 --> 40:34.748
He wasn't a man to work out tactics. And I didn't 
sense any great commitment on his part to a cause

40:35.990 --> 40:53.406
like, to the cause of the working class. I didn't 
realize the real roughness of the man though at the

40:54.331 --> 41:01.802
time, which came out later, you see. When

41:03.325 --> 41:11.878
was the first time that you met Blackie Myers? Oh, I 
met Blackie.

41:19.711 --> 41:21.013
I really don't know. Probably in 36. I'm pretty 
sure I met him in 36. Curiously, Blackie and I were

41:25.679 --> 41:31.927
in the same strike in 1923, though I didn't know him 
then.

41:34.831 --> 41:39.658
It's a chapter that I haven't written yet in my 
second volume. San Pedro, which is the port of Los

41:40.739 --> 41:47.929
Angeles, the IWW...

41:49.883 --> 42:05.043
carried out a strike, shut down the port, 99 ships 
tied up, shut down the port for about five weeks.

42:05.063 --> 42:06.645
And a complete tie-up. It was suppressed with 
police violence. But Blackie was there as a young

42:12.052 --> 42:16.177
seaman, almost a kid. He told me since. But you see, 
there was... There were 3,500 seamen and

42:19.786 --> 42:25.175
longshoremen there, striking. Blackie was in 
that crowd. So we had those memories together.

42:38.177 --> 42:43.245
What were your personal impressions of Blackie 
Myers later, once he died? became an official of

42:44.069 --> 42:46.833
the National American Archive? Well, Blackie was 
extremely effective. He had wonderful appeal,

42:50.479 --> 42:52.542
you know. He had charm. He was an excellent 
speaker. He

42:57.670 --> 43:03.919
had quite a big role, I'd say.

43:08.726 --> 43:12.372
After the seamen in 36 began their movement to form 
the National Maritime Union, how popular did

43:13.398 --> 43:22.688
their cause become in the New York City area? How 
popular did their cause become? Well,

43:26.652 --> 43:41.008
it's often been said that the seamen's union this 
would go back to the Marine Works Industrial

43:41.410 --> 43:50.921
Union, was not just formed by seamen, but it was 
formed also with the help of shoreside

43:41.410 --> 43:50.921
sympathizers. They got a lot of help, 
particularly in the Chelsea area, which is the

43:52.143 --> 44:02.295
west side along the docks there. There

44:03.496 --> 44:10.084
were a lot of good people there. labor-conscious 
people who came down with literature, invited

44:10.486 --> 44:20.456
seamen into their homes, talked unionism to them 
there. But I couldn't answer as to how popular it

44:22.318 --> 44:26.121
was in the city. That's really too broad a 
question. Yes. Well, who were some of the groups

44:28.924 --> 44:33.068
then? They got a lot of help from some very good 
people, though. Well, particularly Congressman

44:38.110 --> 44:41.754
Mark Antonio, you may have heard of him. Yes. Yes. 
He went right to the front for him, did a lot, gave

44:43.997 --> 44:47.941
him a lot of help. And LaGuardia,

44:49.063 --> 44:59.274
first a congressman, and eventually mayor, was 
friendly. LaGuardia.

45:04.300 --> 45:05.822
How was, what was the... During this time period 
from 1936 until 1940, how did the press handle the

45:06.933 --> 45:21.073
National Maritime Union?

45:21.774 --> 45:29.485
Well, the press generally was—most of them were 
anti-Union. They were very cold about it. There

45:35.333 --> 45:36.535
were some exceptions. See, I think the post at that 
time, it had a much better ownership and

45:37.493 --> 45:49.123
management as today. Today it's led by, it's owned 
by a reactionary Australian named Murdoch.
