David Ogden is a stupid fool who will get beat on the 
tennis court. This is a test, but true. This

00:09.433 --> 00:16.682
is an interview with General Andrews. Today is the 
3rd of August, 1981. This is Terry Anderson. Let's

00:21.247 --> 00:26.434
start, General, with where and when you were born, 
and then let's talk about your parents. I was born

00:28.276 --> 00:31.320
on a farm. about 12 miles northeast of Caldwell, 
Texas, on August the 22nd, 1916.

00:40.338 --> 00:47.326
My father

00:40.338 --> 00:47.326
was a rancher, small ranch, small cattle. But his 
primary position was a wildcat oil driller. He

00:54.694 --> 01:01.662
drilled several wells, and one specifically, 
which was a dry well, was on the property in Snook,

01:01.878 --> 01:07.246
Texas, which is now a very productive well here 
recently. Unfortunately, he died at the age of 34

01:09.149 --> 01:19.504
and caused what we now call hepatitis. Then they 
called it yellow jaundice. But he'd been very

01:22.889 --> 01:29.539
prosperous in terms of prosperity at that time in 
that he had at that early age had bought and paid for

01:29.958 --> 01:42.696
the farm, had several hundred head of cattle, and 
was one of the first ones to have a Ford, a Model T,

01:29.958 --> 01:42.696
with bumpers as a kid. I remember that because we 
went to Caldwell and a crowd farmed around it,

01:42.856 --> 01:50.447
looking at these bumpers, you know, really fancy. 
But he died at that early age. I was only five years

01:55.093 --> 01:56.355
old. Do you remember how large the farm was? Well, I 
still have it. Oh, you do? It's 151 acres that we

02:02.005 --> 02:08.973
owned, but at that time, the range was open. You 
could go, so cattle ran outside. In addition,

02:11.976 --> 02:18.203
usually the farm produced corn and beet stuff, and 
cotton, too. Most of it was beet stuff. And from our

02:21.406 --> 02:26.892
farm, you could go eight miles to the railroad. 
That was all open land, no fencing. And you could go

02:29.560 --> 02:36.110
towards the community of Hicks six miles in that 
direction with no fences. And so the cattle would

02:36.130 --> 02:42.499
run free except those with cans or to keep those up. 
And with bells on them. And we had different tone

02:44.542 --> 02:46.005
bells. And you could go out and look for them. And 
you could hear and recognize which small herd

02:49.269 --> 02:55.218
because they weren't all together. But then after 
he passed away, When was that?

03:03.335 --> 03:04.016
In the 1920s? Well, let me see. I was five years old, 
so five was 1921.

03:12.508 --> 03:20.078
My mother moved to Caldwell, and it was kind of 
downhill, and the Depression was going on. I had a

03:20.939 --> 03:22.461
sister. She's deceased now. For us to go to school, 
I wasn't old enough to go to school, but she went to

03:24.364 --> 03:28.069
school. She worked as a seamstress, because when 
he died, all income stopped. Of course, we still

03:36.692 --> 03:40.437
had the farm, but the kids had to have an education. 
So we moved to Caldwell, and she was a seamstress.

03:45.685 --> 03:52.095
And she remained single to put us through school, 
which she did. I graduated from Caldwell High

03:52.115 --> 03:57.803
School in 1934.

04:01.647 --> 04:09.114
But during those years, even though we would be 
considered poor, we didn't know we were poor. We

04:10.715 --> 04:12.917
had enough to eat and clothes to wear. We didn't 
have a car. That car I just described, that Model T,

04:15.079 --> 04:20.424
was sitting back on the farm in a shed. And it 
deteriorated through the years, which is really

04:21.826 --> 04:24.368
pitiful. We finally sold it out for a small amount. 
But we had a car. My mother didn't drive and

04:28.171 --> 04:31.114
couldn't support a car anyway. My grandparents 
lived on the farm and continued on with the, well,

04:32.123 --> 04:39.371
very few cattle. I mean, everything went down 
thanks to what my father had done. What type of

04:43.535 --> 04:47.399
education did your father have? He didn't 
graduate from high school. I think he went through

04:50.583 --> 04:58.951
about the ninth grade and went immediately into 
business in the oil business. And how he got

04:58.971 --> 05:01.354
started in the oil business at that early age, His 
brother-in-law in Beaumont, Texas was out in

05:02.009 --> 05:10.159
Spinnletop. They had a lease out there. The 
Spinnletop boom happened a few years before,

05:12.242 --> 05:18.489
early 1900s. But it was still a boom. I'll never 
forget going out to Spinnletop the first time. You

05:24.857 --> 05:29.262
just see acres and acres of oil wells, derricks. Of 
course, they did it differently. because you put

05:31.878 --> 05:39.768
up a permanent derrick because every few months 
you had what they call pull the well. You had to pull

05:40.349 --> 05:49.100
out all those pipes and flush out because the mud 
type of formation would get there and slow down the

05:40.349 --> 05:49.100
flow. So they used those derricks for that 
purpose. And so every derrick had a lot of long

05:54.487 --> 05:58.813
pipes in reserve.

06:01.426 --> 06:05.412
He

06:01.426 --> 06:05.412
loved his horse. I remember that the horse was 
named Jim. And he would ship his horse to Beaumont.

06:11.282 --> 06:20.256
So each time he'd go, in those days it was simple 
because all you had to do was call up the Santa Fe

06:11.282 --> 06:20.256
Railroad and order a stock cart. And it would stop 
and just lead the horse right aboard. And you could

06:24.683 --> 06:27.568
either ride with the animal in the caboose or, of 
course, take a passenger train, which you usually

06:29.219 --> 06:38.793
take a passenger train because you'd be there 
ready to see the horse.

06:38.813 --> 06:43.861
Do you ever remember if your father died when you 
were five, do you ever remember him? Oh, yeah. What

06:46.805 --> 06:49.069
were your impressions? What type of man he was? 
Tremendous. Of course, being five years old,

06:51.412 --> 06:56.800
obviously, you feel attached to your father 
because he would play with me. He was a member of the

06:59.493 --> 07:03.058
Masons and Woodman of the World, I guess, or the 
other. And his watchbot was here, and I remember I

07:03.078 --> 07:09.967
used to, he'd throw me up, and I'd crawl around and 
play with that watchbot. And he was driving the

07:11.169 --> 07:16.256
car, as I described, when we went to Caldwell on 
that particular occasion. I remember him

07:17.278 --> 07:24.007
saddling up the horse, which was a beautiful 
horse, a gun horse named Jim. And he's very devoted

07:24.027 --> 07:27.812
to his children and to his wife. Now, he met my 
mother, and this is interesting too. In those

07:32.910 --> 07:38.856
days, Bell Telephone didn't, it wasn't even 
existence in the countryside. It existed

07:38.916 --> 07:40.378
somewhere, I'm sure. But the telephone service 
was privately owned. He, in addition to the

07:47.145 --> 07:51.370
cattle, had been an oil and wild cattle. He owned a 
division, meaning that he owned the, telephones

07:57.914 --> 07:59.656
and also the line. And it goes into a switchboard. 
My mother, when she was a young girl, was a

08:03.239 --> 08:10.886
switchboard operator at Goss, Texas. Now, you 
know, it's practically nothing but a few stores.

08:12.988 --> 08:22.517
But that used to be, you know, cotton gin there and 
banks and just all the train stops there. It was

08:22.557 --> 08:26.200
sort of a business center. She was a switchboard 
operator. And my father's part of the line went in

08:29.409 --> 08:34.334
to the switchboard at Goss. So he met my mother 
then. First time he ever heard of her. He talked to

08:39.340 --> 08:41.182
her on the telephone, you know. So he asked her for a 
date and that sort of thing. So that's how their

08:43.865 --> 08:46.849
romance commenced. How much education did your 
mother have? Just about ninth grade also. And

08:53.753 --> 08:55.655
that's because they attended country schools. 
Sure, and that's pretty cool. And then they didn't

08:56.716 --> 08:59.378
have buses, and it's too far to ride a horse. 
They'll bug you if you're out in the boondocks. So

09:00.899 --> 09:02.280
they'd go to the local school. In fact, my mother 
attended a school in the community of Hicks when

09:03.381 --> 09:09.106
she was growing up as a girl. And my father attended 
a school. They don't have it anymore.

09:18.694 --> 09:20.216
In fact, the community's not even there. I can't 
even remember the name of it. Anyway, it was a

09:25.630 --> 09:30.517
vicinity where he bought the farm. What type of 
character or person was your mom? Real strong.

09:36.406 --> 09:37.407
Strong-willed? Oh, yeah. She's a, well, to say she 
raised us. Sure. She remarried, actually, while I

09:42.094 --> 09:45.839
was at A&M. She stayed single all when she was young 
and beautiful, really.

09:52.495 --> 09:57.963
And she had several opportunities to marry, but 
she didn't want her children to be stepchildren.

09:59.546 --> 10:04.954
So my sister was teaching school, and I actually 
married when my mother remarried. And then I was, I

10:05.034 --> 10:08.900
guess I was a junior at the end. She married a real 
fine guy. He's deceased too, both my mother and her

10:12.986 --> 10:15.810
father. His name was Renfro. But she is a very 
strong-willed woman. Woman determined? That's

10:20.747 --> 10:21.448
right. What else? Very religious. And what 
religion? Baptist. Strong Baptist. I'm a

10:29.996 --> 10:31.557
Methodist, and so is my wife. I chained over. Oh, 
yes, she was a really devoted Methodist. I'm

10:35.020 --> 10:35.841
Baptist. She'd never miss a Sunday going to 
church. And she took the children? Oh, yes. How

10:42.367 --> 10:44.969
many brothers and sisters did you have? Just a 
sister. And what happened to her? or is she still

10:48.520 --> 10:49.702
living? No, she

10:49.902 --> 11:02.062
graduated from high school in Caldwell and she 
went to college for two years with Beaumont and

10:49.902 --> 11:02.062
Lamar. I think Lamar had a different name. So she 
went there two years and she lived with my father's

11:06.509 --> 11:14.302
sister in Brooklyn, LaPilps. They had a great big 
two-story house on a great, I guess, about an acre.

11:21.830 --> 11:23.812
So she stayed there. But she fell in love with Frank 
Bowers, who's also from Caldwell. Frank Bowers

11:31.040 --> 11:34.104
had to graduate from high school. He went to 
University of Texas. He became a pharmacist. And

11:37.007 --> 11:39.450
so they lived in Houston. He was a pharmacist out in 
that hospital complex. Nothing. It's a big

11:46.165 --> 11:51.030
pharmacy that supported two or three of the 
hospital. He's still alive, but my sister died at

11:51.050 --> 12:01.381
age 58 of cancer.

12:01.401 --> 12:08.609
As far as leadership is concerned, you said that 
your father was in a lot of organizations. Was he

12:08.909 --> 12:12.093
the leader of any of those organizations? Not to my 
knowledge, no. Was your mother in any social

12:13.975 --> 12:17.700
organizations back in Colville? Well, she 
belonged to the... Woman's clubs or anything?

12:24.087 --> 12:30.856
Well, she also, the Woodman's of the World also, I 
think they have a ladies auxiliary. She belonged

12:30.876 --> 12:32.197
to that. But she worked. She worked long hours. And 
she didn't get much money for it either. But you

12:40.874 --> 12:45.661
know, in those days, a dollar a day was just about 
the going wage. And anybody that made more than

12:45.701 --> 12:51.308
that was

12:45.701 --> 12:51.308
a lot of people. Just like when we would get to A&M, I 
worked for $0.25 an hour. Been delighted to get it.

13:00.601 --> 13:09.413
Now, when you came home from school,

13:00.601 --> 13:09.413
who took care of you and your sister? Well, my 
mother did because she was working. She was a

13:12.965 --> 13:14.767
seamstress then at home? Yeah. OK. It was a big 
two-story house in Caldwell. It's no longer

13:19.813 --> 13:22.556
there, right on the courthouse square. And she 
worked with a lady named Mrs. Purdue. The two of

13:28.904 --> 13:31.447
them worked together. And they had their sewing 
room in the front part of the house. And Mrs. Perdue

13:40.156 --> 13:45.584
had an apartment, two or three rooms. And we had two 
rooms. So when we'd come home, of course, we'd

13:50.070 --> 13:52.594
check in there. But like all kids, I was ended 
because I lived right in town. There was a lot of

13:59.704 --> 14:03.930
kids that lived across from the jail, for example. 
And that was always interesting with the prison

14:04.771 --> 14:07.255
and stuff. And we used to run errands for them. You 
must go get some tobacco or some stuff. You got to

14:12.978 --> 14:17.445
send the money down in a can on a string.

14:22.733 --> 14:28.702
But speaking of leadership or influence, and I 
think. And what way did your parents influence you

14:29.303 --> 14:34.111
toward leadership, do you think? Your mother. I 
don't know. They just wanted me to excel. To do

14:39.168 --> 14:48.838
right and to attend school and be all of the 
standards that you would expect as parents. But

14:49.839 --> 14:58.929
see, I had no father, had no male influence, but the 
one who really had influence on me growing up in

14:49.839 --> 14:58.929
school was a football coach. Okay. Let's talk 
about him. What was his name? Darby. E.E. Darby.

15:06.817 --> 15:08.078
His nickname was Ox. And he's still alive, and he's 
over in Colorado now, retired.

15:15.528 --> 15:16.329
Great big guy. He was a star for four years at San 
Marcos. Then that was Southwest Teachers

15:21.194 --> 15:24.878
College, I think they called it there. And he was a 
captain for two years, junior and senior year. So

15:31.064 --> 15:34.047
he had all those sweaters, those days they gave 
sweaters. He had them all the way from one strike to

15:34.768 --> 15:36.850
the Those were the end of his senior year. He had two 
stars for being a captain, you know, his junior

15:39.112 --> 15:44.817
year, and then another strike. And he was a real 
solid, fine individual. A disciplinarian, by the

15:47.819 --> 15:49.340
way. Mimi. I'm sorry to interrupt. I'm a fellow. 
I'd like you to meet my wife, Mimi. Oh, how are you?

15:57.388 --> 16:01.231
Well, go on with your talk. OK. I apologize. I can't 
offer you much. It's all right. I didn't have food.

16:07.897 --> 16:09.239
Okay. Let's continue then about your coach. He was 
a, as I was saying, he was a disciplinarian. Max

16:15.627 --> 16:16.749
Darby. And, of course, like I do now, but also 
there, not only did he coach baseball, football,

16:16.769 --> 16:28.885
basketball, track, but carried a pretty heavy 
academic load. Taught civics and history. And he

16:32.430 --> 16:35.454
did all of those well. He didn't smoke. He didn't 
drink until immediately. And he had no patience

16:40.179 --> 16:44.245
for any high school kid that would smoke. And of 
course, it appealed on us, because we were just

16:44.265 --> 16:50.673
doing our best to please him, to keep him 
conditioned. I wasn't very large. In fact, my

16:51.715 --> 16:56.741
senior year, I weighed 150 pounds. But I really put 
out. And he was my model, male model. Of course, I

17:02.629 --> 17:06.895
never aspired to be a college football player. I 
just thought if I could live my life like him, I

17:07.398 --> 17:15.389
figured I'd be a great asset. The other one that had 
a tremendous influence on me was the president of

17:16.831 --> 17:24.903
the Caldwell National Bank named C.C. Nell. How do 
you spell that last name? N-E-L-L-M-S. And of

17:28.608 --> 17:33.875
course he's long deceased. But he was a kind,

17:38.735 --> 17:45.421
He was the grandfather of my good friend, Nettie 
Kaye, who he too is deceased now. So that's how I got

17:45.441 --> 17:46.782
to know him. And he accepted me and his wife and 
their home just as if I was one of the family. What

17:53.869 --> 17:57.332
type of person was he? Well,

17:57.372 --> 18:05.620
he was a very religious individual.

18:07.608 --> 18:09.150
fault that I know that he ever had. He chewed the 
backer, but he did it in a way that you had to really

18:10.612 --> 18:17.162
know him to know because a great golfer. We didn't 
have a golf course in Caldwell then. They have a

18:19.726 --> 18:21.108
nine hole course there now. So he played in Bryan. 
He doesn't go to church as much as I want to because

18:24.773 --> 18:28.859
Sunday was his golf playing day. So I was going over 
to Bryan. But he was a very good man. And he helped me

18:34.827 --> 18:36.610
out on several occasions. For example,

18:39.957 --> 18:51.209
When I was going to A&M my junior year, I had no money 
to buy boots for the senior year and so forth. So the

18:51.349 --> 18:57.075
association of ex-students, I guess they still do 
that. You could borrow money from them. So I

18:59.017 --> 19:03.002
borrowed money, and you need somebody to co-sign a 
note. And I went into Mr. Naum, and he said, well,

19:03.022 --> 19:08.968
this is kind of unusual for a banker to be 
co-signing somebody else's note. that I'm happy

19:09.910 --> 19:13.294
to help you. So after graduation and I got the money 
and paid him back, I brought that council note back

19:14.595 --> 19:25.488
to him and he liked it and wanted to question his 
mind about it. But those were probably the two male

19:26.529 --> 19:33.397
models since I had no father that I really 
respected and admired. And what did you learn from

19:33.557 --> 19:34.778
these two?

19:37.882 --> 19:39.023
How did they influence you? Well, probably a male 
lifestyle. Darby being much younger and being

19:45.410 --> 19:58.909
disciplined and having high standards, both 
physically, obviously, but also moral

19:45.410 --> 19:58.909
standards. Nem's the same thing. Darby was single 
at the time. Later on, he married. But Nem's had

20:04.037 --> 20:09.685
this big home, nice furniture, and happiness, and 
he just said, well, if you're going to strive for a

20:10.373 --> 20:29.112
goal in the community, I would like to be patterned 
after Ox Darby and attain the level of success as

20:10.373 --> 20:29.112
Nelms did, or was at that time. Were they leaders in 
their own right? Well, Nelms was. He was a leader of

20:32.295 --> 20:34.417
the Chamber of Commerce.

20:36.860 --> 20:38.862
Darby was a leader because he won district nearly 
every year. In fact, the last time I talked to him, I

20:40.631 --> 20:48.819
asked him, say, in your lifetime, one loss, what 
was it? You know, you're always talking about Bear

20:48.839 --> 20:50.841
Bryant and all that. That's the way that you 
majored. He said, I really don't know. I said,

20:54.424 --> 21:04.814
well, we didn't win district the year I played, but 
you won it the year before. In fact, they won by

21:04.834 --> 21:07.617
district. He said, well, we had some rough years 
also. But he said, every time I was down and had a bad

21:10.736 --> 21:15.221
year, they'd get ready to fire me. Just before they 
fired me, we had a successful year. So he was a

21:18.284 --> 21:21.829
football coach there for, I guess, 25 years. And I 
wish I knew he had won a loss record, because I know

21:23.571 --> 21:28.196
it is really a fair favor. Because he just didn't 
lose in any game. But we won more games the year that

21:31.179 --> 21:35.224
I played I was out for four years. I came out when I 
was a freshman. I was a scrub, you know. And what

21:41.323 --> 21:42.745
position did you play? In, right in. But my senior 
year, I made the team and played right in and didn't

21:45.108 --> 21:52.977
miss a quarter the entire season. In those days... 
Were you a tight end? Well, we didn't. Different

21:57.021 --> 21:59.004
formations. And you played offense and defense. 
And you really had to be hurt to be taken out of the

22:02.748 --> 22:06.392
game because After you once was taken out in a 
quarter, you couldn't come back that quarter. And

22:13.186 --> 22:16.011
you had four quarters. And you played offensive 
defense. You didn't have near the number two. And a

22:20.457 --> 22:26.827
formation that then we had

22:20.457 --> 22:26.827
a short punt formation. They called it short punt 
because you weren't going to punt, but you lined up

22:26.847 --> 22:30.773
very similar. And of course, you had double wing 
back. Center always centered, you know, back. In

22:40.019 --> 22:50.352
other words, you sort of play, call it a shotgun 
now, but that's what you played every time then

22:40.019 --> 22:50.352
because just getting the quarterback underneath 
the center, that's a late development. Were you in

22:52.616 --> 22:53.617
other sports? Well, I played basketball, but I 
never was on it. I went out for everything. What

23:02.870 --> 23:08.255
about other activities in school? Scouting, I was 
a big boy scout. Very active in the church.

23:15.721 --> 23:17.443
Baptist, you know that? B-Y-P-U, Baptist Young 
Peoples.

23:22.848 --> 23:30.835
I even, and I was very religious in the sense that I 
participated in all the activities. We had a

23:31.810 --> 23:35.815
prayer meeting on Wednesday night. All of the 
young people did. They didn't have TV. Radio was

23:39.960 --> 23:41.882
just coming along. And it was static. It was 
terrible. So the church and school was our whole

23:44.305 --> 23:50.012
entire element in life. And not many cars. All 
families didn't have cars. Those that did, well,

23:55.639 --> 24:01.446
the reason I say we didn't have a car, but I didn't 
know it was poor, My friends had a car. And they

24:04.910 --> 24:07.733
treated me as if I had a car. It wasn't the case that 
you get your car today and I get mine. So I'd say the

24:11.737 --> 24:20.886
church and the school, and we were very much closer 
to teachers then than children are now. We called

24:20.906 --> 24:22.688
us a school activity. Plays, for example, that was 
a big deal, you know, playing. Trying out for the

24:27.513 --> 24:30.876
plays and putting on the plays. But sports I loved, 
even though I was small. I went out and did my best to

24:34.653 --> 24:41.140
ever win, including track.

24:41.180 --> 24:42.801
Were you a leader in any of these groups? No, I 
wouldn't say I was a leader. You participated, but

24:47.647 --> 24:53.153
were you like the president of the student finance 
or the captain of the football team? No, I was never

24:53.193 --> 24:56.376
captain of the football team. So your leadership 
ability came later. Well, I wouldn't be so.

25:03.813 --> 25:08.038
arrogant to say that leadership, I've been lucky 
all my life. Things turned out for me.

25:14.385 --> 25:17.028
You might even say maybe leadership was thrust 
upon me. Well, you assumed the role of leadership

25:17.148 --> 25:19.991
then later in your life. I would say that without 
being a president of any

25:20.271 --> 25:33.786
society or activity,

25:20.271 --> 25:33.786
I was considered a leader in our group. in the 
church. Sort of an informal leader. In what way?

25:41.937 --> 25:44.960
Well, the ones who suggest doing certain things. 
We had a quartet. I can't sing, but at least I was in a

25:48.064 --> 25:50.807
quartet. And I'd be the one who would suggest maybe 
when we would rehearse, or where we would

25:52.368 --> 25:59.676
rehearse, and that sort of thing. Along, of 
course, with the support of the one who's

25:59.696 --> 26:05.022
functioning at the time.

26:07.988 --> 26:13.015
What were your favorite subjects when you were in 
high school? I guess history was one of my

26:13.035 --> 26:25.873
favorites.

26:25.893 --> 26:27.956
You mean what other besides history? No, just... 
Would you have considered yourself well-liked or

26:27.976 --> 26:33.264
popular in high school? Yeah. I played in the band 
all the time. I went out for all activities. Seems

26:39.942 --> 26:41.084
like you did everything. How were your grades? 
About average.

26:48.012 --> 26:51.296
I had one or two teachers, but I was sort of a 
favorite. I got better grades than them. Really a

26:55.301 --> 26:57.503
good-looking woman. Of course, she was young. She 
looked old, didn't she? And named Miss Welch. But

27:07.793 --> 27:14.080
all through school, as you know, as your name 
starts today, you always get seated in the front.

27:14.100 --> 27:18.546
And now nearly every class, we're sitting up first 
seat or right near the teacher. But I think history

27:19.547 --> 27:29.719
is the thing because it intrigued me, especially 
to read and study about outstanding people.

27:32.823 --> 27:36.467
There have been forms of mankind and culture Now, 
when you graduated in 1934, did you have a firm set

27:37.679 --> 27:45.790
of aims? I mean, did you know exactly what you 
wanted? Did you have any idea of what you wanted to

27:48.334 --> 27:51.318
become in future life? Yep. What was that? Well, I 
wanted to be a professional lawyer, but I wanted to

27:53.100 --> 27:59.509
be a professional soldier. You did? Yeah. Did you 
have any taste of the military before you

28:01.091 --> 28:06.218
graduated from high school?

28:08.982 --> 28:11.948
You see that I was a joiner. I joined the National 
Guard when I was in high school. I was very naive

28:16.797 --> 28:22.107
because I didn't realize I was falsified when I 
signed it. And nobody said, hey, you're supposed

28:22.367 --> 28:25.473
to be 18 years old. You're not 18 yet. And the reason 
why there was no problem with that is that The

28:33.113 --> 28:35.455
National Guard in those days, very small. We had, I 
think, 110 in the company in Caldwell. They had a

28:38.778 --> 28:42.541
company there, infantry. And I've already 
mentioned, first I was a Boy Scout. I loved the

28:45.424 --> 28:46.725
uniforms. I liked to camp out and do those things. 
And I was in the band, playing in the band. And there

28:55.352 --> 29:01.838
was an officer in National Guard Austin, Waco, 
named Napoleon Rainbow.

29:02.290 --> 29:10.438
He says, in addition to the 143rd band, says, this 
summer at Palacios, Texas, we want to have a drum

29:02.290 --> 29:10.438
and bugle corps. So he sent out the word. Well, our 
company commander,

29:13.521 --> 29:26.814
named Ockridge at the time, asked if we were 
interested in joining the National Guard and

29:13.521 --> 29:26.814
going to Summer County. I said, oh, yeah. Well, I 
get very much since I played the drum, snare drum.

29:30.597 --> 29:32.179
That was my thing. So I joined the National Guard 
and went there and liked it very much. And so I

29:39.643 --> 29:42.266
continued on participating in the drills. Of 
course, once again, those days you got a dollar for

29:42.286 --> 29:47.371
drills once a week. Sure. That was a lot of money for 
a kid in high school. And so I continued on. And then

29:56.100 --> 29:57.762
when I went to A&M, I didn't know at the time, but you 
just didn't join the National Guard. And then when

30:02.877 --> 30:05.941
you stopped going to drill, they dropped your name 
ball. You were put into the, I think it's called

30:07.403 --> 30:14.231
now, inactive reserve. But you're still not

30:14.252 --> 30:28.390
only eligible, but you still really have a 
commitment to continue on to fulfill your

30:14.252 --> 30:28.390
enlistment. Well, later on, it turned out Fine, 
because when World War II came along, lo and

30:30.715 --> 30:41.431
behold, I found that I could claim longevity pay 
because they forgave anybody and you could go

30:30.715 --> 30:41.431
back. Anybody who signed up, regardless if you 
were 16 or 17 or whatever it was, you were still a

30:42.252 --> 30:51.406
member since you had that commitment. And they 
overlooked, I guess is a better word, it was a law

30:51.426 --> 30:58.697
that said all service before age 18 We'll count for 
long days. Now, I wanted a career in the military. I

31:05.877 --> 31:06.877
wanted to go to A&M. Why? The seniors, that's the 
reason why I have boots and spurs. It really has an

31:13.223 --> 31:16.126
impression on you. I like scouts. I like the 
military. And there weren't many people

31:21.171 --> 31:25.495
graduating, going to A&M. This was all during the 
Depression and before then, I think. So they would

31:32.491 --> 31:38.881
come from A&M to Caldwell for whatever reason, the 
seniors, with their boots on. I'll buy a guy some

31:38.901 --> 31:43.809
day, I don't know, a lot of those boots. And I'm not 
proud of them, I don't have any money. So once

31:48.436 --> 31:49.598
again, I was lucky.

31:52.382 --> 31:55.026
Doc Mize had been

31:57.942 --> 32:00.865
became the band leader at Allen Military Academy. 
I don't know what ever happened to Doc Meyers, but

32:01.545 --> 32:04.988
he was a well-known individual. At Baylor, he had a 
band, and his claim to fame was he could play two

32:05.949 --> 32:17.259
clarinets at the same time. Two reeds, and then his 
clarinet ended for long.

32:23.765 --> 32:26.447
So he had just arrived at Allen Academy, And Nat 
Allen, this is the old man, I don't know, did you

32:27.068 --> 32:32.375
know Nat Allen, Jr.? Of course, he's about my age, 
he's not so young. This is his father, who owned

32:37.302 --> 32:43.391
Allen Academy, being then a private, he owned it 
the other time. So he was expanding his band. So he

32:46.916 --> 32:53.304
came over and talked to me and said, say, why don't 
you come to Allen Academy? I said, I'd be

32:53.324 --> 32:55.928
delighted, but I don't have any money. He said, 
well, I can get you a scholarship. You work in the

33:01.660 --> 33:04.684
mess as a waiter.

33:07.708 --> 33:11.132
But you'll have to raise some money for tuition. It 
wasn't very much, but the main cost was a room and

33:11.152 --> 33:13.856
board. My sister was teaching school, and she 
could loan me the money for the tuition. So I got the

33:20.465 --> 33:21.767
Allen Academy. And now I was a stepping stone, 
hopefully, to A&M. But also, there was a

33:27.110 --> 33:41.302
possibility that I could get an appointment at the 
military academy because it was an ROTC

33:27.110 --> 33:41.302
honor-rated school, and they took one graduate 
each year to the military academy. So I thought

33:42.884 --> 33:45.646
maybe this would be my break. So I went to school 
there, but unfortunately for me, there's an

33:45.666 --> 33:55.935
officer from West Texas named Windorf. from the 
town. You know, there's a lot of Czechs and he's a

33:57.963 --> 34:00.145
Czech. West Texas is a Czech community. And he was 
really good in math. So he got the appointment for

34:05.151 --> 34:08.394
the military academy. Now my problem, how am I 
going to A&M? Still no money. So...

34:11.417 --> 34:15.722
How long did you stay at Allen? One year. Actually, 
Allen at that time was one year and a half. And you

34:23.731 --> 34:24.792
can transfer I don't know what it's called. It's a 
junior college now, ain't it? No. It's back to a

34:29.983 --> 34:31.625
high school. And A&M would accept. So many 
students went there, and then went to A&M, and

34:35.611 --> 34:40.818
their sophomore year transferred.

34:43.902 --> 34:52.433
So I

34:43.902 --> 34:52.433
can't recall his name now, but he was married to Nat 
Allen's sister, of course the Allen family owned

34:52.987 --> 34:57.472
the school. And he talked to me and he was the 
assistant to the head of the dairy husbandry

34:57.492 --> 35:04.520
department, C.N. Sheperson. I think he's 
deceased now too, I think I read it several years

35:06.782 --> 35:09.726
ago. But he was the head of the, well he became head 
of the, what's the department now? Agricultural

35:17.955 --> 35:20.918
department, do they have that now?

35:24.037 --> 35:25.519
That's a dean, isn't it? Well, he was a dean then, 
Dean Shepparton. So he told me if I wanted to go to

35:30.225 --> 35:35.892
A&M, he thinks he could get me in with a job. But I'd 
have to major in dairy husbandry. I said, I don't

35:39.416 --> 35:40.918
care what the major is. I just want to go to A&M.

35:46.365 --> 35:53.554
So he arranged for me to go in the summer, the fall . 
So I transferred my credits. So I was down on the old

35:56.119 --> 35:57.741
dairy farm. Then on the dairy farm, it's all gone 
now. Behind the creamery, there was a row, eight

36:00.985 --> 36:08.454
single houses. Each of those, one was occupied by 
an employee with his family. The rest of them were

36:15.063 --> 36:21.651
rooms that students could live in while they were 
going to school. So I got a job, 25 cents an hour,

36:23.808 --> 36:29.775
shoveling manure. And you know, the dairy cattle 
go all around. And then when they took them into the

36:35.181 --> 36:38.565
stall, the milking they had. You'd shovel it out? 
Yeah, to clean out all that stuff. You'd put it into

36:41.468 --> 36:42.870
a wagon. And some of the other tasks was hay. I 
remember that was the toughest job, unloading hay

36:47.215 --> 36:51.540
off of a truck. And you had to put it way up in the top. 
of the barn, and it was hot inside. So that was the

36:59.101 --> 37:05.166
type of work I was doing during the summer, and 
going to summer school. Then I discovered, to my

37:05.186 --> 37:21.242
chagrin and shock, that I wasn't on the list to live 
in those houses during the fall,

37:05.186 --> 37:21.242
because they had commitment to the others. They 
were coming back. Where did you live? Well, this

37:24.254 --> 37:27.578
employee, and I can't remember his last name. His 
first name was Joe. He heard about my plight, and he

37:29.460 --> 37:34.026
said, say, I'll tell you what. I'll fix up my back 
porch. It was partially enclosed anyway with

37:37.591 --> 37:45.480
glass, but not all of it. But he said, I can get a map 
down on the screen here, and that still is going to

37:45.500 --> 37:53.991
be pretty cold, but it doesn't make any difference 
because I want to sleep there. And so I started out

37:55.051 --> 37:58.736
that way. So my first year at A&M, I lived on the back 
porch of one of those houses. The next year, of

38:07.168 --> 38:13.376
course, I got a roof with a roof maker. In what dorm? 
Pardon? In what dorm? No, not on campus. Oh, still

38:18.303 --> 38:19.164
on campus. Still down in the town. In fact, I lived 
there the entire time. So it was convenient to work

38:22.468 --> 38:23.590
there. My working hours, we used to get up at 4 
o'clock in the morning and work in the creamery and

38:23.806 --> 38:30.832
work until first class. Of course, leaving in time 
to walk on campus. Well, that's really on campus,

38:36.177 --> 38:40.041
quick walk through the classroom. But the next 
year, I

38:40.061 --> 38:46.787
was able to work in the creamery. Now, that was a 
real good job, you see, because you wore white

38:46.807 --> 38:51.231
starch coveralls what you do for a pasteurized 
milk. First, starting off like I was, the bottom of

38:54.189 --> 38:57.534
a washed bottle.

39:00.277 --> 39:06.125
Then we haul the milk to the dining hall, and we 
bring back the empty bottles. Of course, we have to

39:06.145 --> 39:13.816
wash them and pasteurize the milk, fill them up, 
and get them back in routine like that. So in the

39:13.836 --> 39:16.499
creamery, that was the least desirable job. And I 
spent most of my time doing that the first year in

39:17.500 --> 39:21.606
the creamery. But my junior and senior year, I was 
pasteurized milk, made cottage cheese, make ice

39:22.413 --> 39:31.305
cream, you know, that sort of thing. All of them 
were real nice jobs. What corps are you in, where

39:34.189 --> 39:35.471
you're with? Well, I was with the infantry. C 
Company. They had a...

39:41.619 --> 39:48.969
See, I was known as a day dodger. Everybody then 
lived in the in the dormitory, or halls in the

39:53.497 --> 39:59.728
dormitory halls. Everybody wore a uniform. Even 
if you only had one leg, you wore a uniform. You were

40:06.440 --> 40:10.006
non-military, but you wore a uniform and you were 
subject. It was patterned out to the military cap.

40:11.649 --> 40:14.815
Exactly right. There were some of us who lived off 
campus or out of the halls. Well, some lived in

40:20.193 --> 40:24.999
brines, particularly non-military. But it was 
really a fine school. I think it's great now, but

40:28.444 --> 40:33.270
it's a different school now. This was a... Let's 
talk about the Depression for a minute. How did the

40:38.256 --> 40:44.044
Depression affect your upbringing?

40:44.064 --> 40:48.249
Well, I think it had a very positive influence. In 
what way? learn to appreciate small things,

40:50.703 --> 41:03.779
learning to get by and be happy with very little.

41:07.443 --> 41:18.516
In some way, I guess a print to my mother, I said that 
I never compared my life and say I got a dirty deal.

41:19.002 --> 41:20.364
We're living on the poverty line. All the things 
they emphasize now, you know, ghettos and all

41:20.424 --> 41:25.271
that. We had a nice place to live, had clothes, 
enough to eat, with very little money to spend.

41:37.127 --> 41:46.680
I remember, fortunately, my father had a good 
friend named Ben Hill, who worked in the grocery

41:37.127 --> 41:46.680
store. And I'd get a penny. My mother would give me a 
penny. I'd go to Ben Hill and ask for a penny's worth

41:53.252 --> 41:56.536
of candy. Of course, he knew my father a long time. 
He had an orphan. And he'd give me a big sack full of

42:03.306 --> 42:08.333
candy for a penny.

42:14.923 --> 42:18.608
So that's where I got my candy supply. Then I'd do 
odd jobs around to mow grass. So the Depression, in

42:24.147 --> 42:31.875
other words, gave you a value or appreciation for 
money?

42:35.879 --> 42:37.000
Well, not only money. A

42:37.040 --> 42:44.528
certain amount of pride. See, it's like in the 
cadet prayer. my line is to help me to live above the

42:49.638 --> 42:56.929
level of the common mass, you know. And, of course, 
I didn't even know about the cadet prayer at that

42:56.949 --> 43:00.214
time. But I took great pride in not having much, but 
living above the level of the common mass, without

43:02.056 --> 43:12.231
stealing anything like that. But I appreciated 
everything, what anybody would do. Because,

43:16.658 --> 43:18.801
like, here in my mind, I think about Anybody say 
candy? What the hell is that? I appreciate that

43:23.193 --> 43:30.282
candy, although you say, well, that's a little 
bordering on dishonest on Ben Hill's part, but not

43:23.193 --> 43:30.282
so much. But I knew, and I didn't do that very often, 
but I appreciated what it means to have candy. Now

43:41.777 --> 43:48.906
we go to school, and the kids, their parents would 
give them some money, and there's like old school,

43:41.777 --> 43:48.906
a little candy store across the way. They all went 
over there and got candy during the recess,

43:49.392 --> 43:56.641
especially at lunchtime, after they'd come back 
from eating. I didn't have any money then for the

43:56.661 --> 44:02.108
candy, even though it only cost a nickel. But I 
wasn't bitter. I didn't feel like I'd been dumped

44:03.149 --> 44:04.951
upon. I accepted.

44:10.338 --> 44:16.125
Sometimes, I'm not sure I could do that now, but I'm 
just telling you, growing up, it had a good

44:10.338 --> 44:16.125
positive effect. Right now, my wife accuses me of 
being, of course, being Andrews, a Scotchman, of

44:17.843 --> 44:24.090
being tight. For example, I've got to play golf, 
and my brother-in-law from Dallas is a doctor. And

44:33.861 --> 44:39.988
when he goes and plays golf, he doesn't think about 
taking out the ball in Washington and so forth. He

44:41.990 --> 44:46.315
uses new balls every time he plays, you know. I 
could do that too, I don't play so much golf, I could

44:46.632 --> 44:50.436
afford it. But do I have a, no. I don't even throw 
away no water balls. And

44:54.800 --> 45:05.150
it isn't because of the tie, it's because I just 
reared in a different frame of reference. I don't

45:05.250 --> 45:11.556
think I articulate that very well, but in my own 
mind I don't know exactly. So I thought it was a

45:11.576 --> 45:12.997
positive thing. Now you take this youngster of my 
brother-in-law, who lives in Dallas with a

45:16.703 --> 45:25.637
doctor, he does exactly like his father. He goes 
out and plays golf. He uses a new ball. And he won't

45:28.802 --> 45:29.763
even look one. He'll knock them way out there and 
maybe look a little while. You know, to him, that's

45:32.447 --> 45:34.330
just a golf ball. A dollar. He'll get more dollars 
than that.

45:40.868 --> 45:42.891
I really don't think that's healthy. I think 
everybody shouldn't. I may not be extreme like I

45:44.513 --> 45:47.157
am, but everybody should.

45:51.022 --> 45:52.124
He's been reared. I wouldn't say they're wealthy, 
but they're well off. This kid had a Camaro when he

45:56.470 --> 45:59.013
was in high school. He thanks all that for granted. 
And he doesn't have much patience with this poor

46:01.135 --> 46:08.846
guy that lives down the street here that's working 
his tail off, you know, not even no more than the

46:01.135 --> 46:08.846
minimum wage. He's got a wife and three sick 
children. So it gives you humility. Yeah. And it

46:16.897 --> 46:21.343
stays with you all the time, a feeling for your 
fellow man. And patience, too, with other people.

46:25.409 --> 46:26.350
It teaches you patience. Did the Depression have 
any impact on your political philosophy? During

46:31.928 --> 46:45.469
this time, of course, Franklin Roosevelt came out 
with his New Deal, and I was wondering if you

46:31.928 --> 46:45.469
remember if you did or did not support Roosevelt.
