one two three four one two three four stop check and be sure this is february 19 sitting in the uh lobby of the rudder uh auditorium ready to chat with jane lester about being one of the first coeds in the 1960s jane try your mic okay uh i was

00:28.803 --> 00:32.930
co-ed in the fall of 1963, which was the first year.

00:38.338 --> 00:44.668
Jane, since someone who hears this or reads it in years after this might not know your background,

00:45.273 --> 00:52.146
Describe where you grew up and what you did and so forth before coming to A&M in the fall of 63.

00:52.467 --> 00:53.028
Okay.

00:53.870 --> 00:58.499
I was born on September the 3rd, 1942 in Electra, Texas.

00:59.120 --> 01:05.172
My dad worked for a continental oil company as a, he made gasoline is what he did.

01:06.113 --> 01:18.593
He moved around quite a bit with an oil company and we moved when I was a junior in high school to Andrews, Texas and that's where I graduated from high school.

01:19.654 --> 01:34.197
I went from Andrews to Lubbock to Texas Tech for two and a half years and when the decree came down that Texas A&M would admit co-eds, my husband

01:34.177 --> 01:41.850
asked me to marry him, and so we did that summer, and in the fall of 1963, we headed to College Station, Texas.

01:42.571 --> 01:49.283
Your answer infers that y'all might not have gotten married at that time if women had not been admissible.

01:49.944 --> 01:51.747
I don't think we would have.

01:52.368 --> 01:54.452
Now, you had known him for a long time in high school?

01:54.813 --> 01:56.536
We were in high school together, yes.

01:58.901 --> 02:03.129
And so you came after two years at Tech.

02:03.149 --> 02:03.911
What was your major?

02:04.292 --> 02:07.037
At Tech, yes, I was there two and a half years, in fact.

02:07.077 --> 02:13.009
I had gone to summer school, and I was majoring in elementary education.

02:13.900 --> 02:20.678
And he was in the same, academically he was in the same graduating class from high school and so forth.

02:20.778 --> 02:22.864
Yes, we both graduated from high school in 1961.

02:22.924 --> 02:30.103
Alright, had you visited A&M College Station before you came to live here?

02:30.455 --> 02:45.848
I had been here, I guess one time, I came down on spring break, stayed with my sister who was married at that time and lived in College Station and just spent the spring break time

02:45.828 --> 02:57.922
with her and her husband, and I had ridden a train from Lubbock to College Station, and then I rode a train back to Lubbock from College Station.

02:57.942 --> 03:00.605
Now, was the purpose of the trip to see a special young man?

03:00.785 --> 03:02.007
Yes, it was.

03:02.568 --> 03:07.654
What was it like to visit as a non-student then?

03:07.714 --> 03:08.875
Describe that weekend.

03:09.135 --> 03:11.498
Well, it was...

03:11.478 --> 03:13.741
Actually, I stayed the whole week.

03:13.781 --> 03:19.630
It was spring break, and it was spring break at both schools, so there really wasn't any students here.

03:20.030 --> 03:23.575
We just enjoyed visiting.

03:23.595 --> 03:26.960
I didn't get to see my sister very much because we were so far apart.

03:27.361 --> 03:37.215
It was track season, and he was on the track team, and we attended some track meets that week.

03:37.550 --> 03:41.785
Describe your impression of College Station and of Texas A&M.

03:42.749 --> 03:45.138
Well, I thought it was just a little town.

03:45.158 --> 03:49.112
I didn't really think that it was, I mean, I didn't think it was as

03:49.700 --> 03:51.484
as Lubbock was.

03:51.925 --> 03:55.753
I mean, it was like coming from the city to the country.

03:56.715 --> 03:58.960
It was laid back.

03:59.020 --> 04:02.789
There wasn't a lot of traffic, as I recall.

04:03.530 --> 04:08.822
In fact, I don't think a lot of kids even had cars that were, you know, at school.

04:10.574 --> 04:13.379
Y'all got married then and come here in the fall of 63?

04:13.739 --> 04:28.423
We married in August of 63 and we chose our wedding date because it was the last weekend in August and that would give us two weeks to get everything together and get our U-Haul trailer packed and move to College Station.

04:29.565 --> 04:32.089
And that's what we did.

04:32.149 --> 04:35.474
Describe your belongings.

04:35.575 --> 04:37.037
Describe what y'all brought.

04:37.726 --> 04:47.297
We brought our clothes, our shower gifts, which were pots, pans, sheets, towels, and that sort of thing.

04:48.098 --> 04:53.805
We moved into Hintzel Apartments, which were considered very nice at that time.

04:55.087 --> 04:59.051
And it was furnished, and we didn't have any furniture.

04:59.352 --> 05:02.636
We had just, and it was not air conditioned.

05:02.696 --> 05:05.539
I remember that.

05:05.873 --> 05:07.836
And you got here when it was still hot.

05:07.976 --> 05:08.397
Oh, yes.

05:08.777 --> 05:17.190
We got here about the second weekend in September because school back then didn't start until the middle of September, probably the 15th or so.

05:17.250 --> 05:19.473
And so we were here about a week.

05:19.493 --> 05:31.932
And humidity nearly killed me because, I mean, I was, although not used to necessarily every place I was air conditioned, it was just so hard to even sleep at night when the humidity is so high.

05:33.700 --> 05:39.846
Describe, since Hensel Apartments are now gone, describe that project,

05:40.282 --> 05:41.924
I didn't know the pencil was gone.

05:43.166 --> 05:47.293
It was considered really nice.

05:47.393 --> 05:51.198
It was downstairs and upstairs, and we had an upstairs apartment.

05:52.621 --> 05:58.690
It was a brick and mortar type apartment.

05:59.892 --> 06:09.546
It was just a bedroom, a bathroom, and a kitchen that was very small with a living and eating area all in one room.

06:10.387 --> 06:14.875
And you got acquainted quickly with your neighbors?

06:14.955 --> 06:16.798
Oh, all of our neighbors were just like we were.

06:16.978 --> 06:18.601
I mean, just so poor.

06:18.922 --> 06:23.610
And most of them, the wives worked and did not go to school.

06:23.690 --> 06:25.433
They were, you know, putting husband through.

06:25.453 --> 06:30.322
And I got acquainted with the people that lived around me.

06:30.382 --> 06:32.766
And also there was a lot of...

06:33.218 --> 06:37.322
foreign people that were in Hensel apartments.

06:37.382 --> 06:39.564
That was a new experience for me.

06:39.604 --> 06:40.645
I had not been around.

06:41.506 --> 06:43.328
Where were they from?

06:43.448 --> 06:44.049
What nations?

06:44.129 --> 06:52.517
They were, I would call them Middle Easterners, like Pakistanis, maybe some Egyptians and things like that.

06:52.537 --> 07:02.027
And I can remember that also we had neighbors who were from

07:02.918 --> 07:14.693
I believe it was Cincinnati, Ohio, and he was here on a National Science Foundation scholarship, and he had a little girl like eight and a little boy like six, and they lived in Hensel apartment.

07:15.454 --> 07:16.755
They were making do.

07:18.197 --> 07:18.578
What was it?

07:18.598 --> 07:19.799
Do you remember what the rent was?

07:20.120 --> 07:20.640
Yes, I do.

07:21.061 --> 07:23.644
It was $65 a month.

07:25.750 --> 07:26.731
That was a lot of money.

07:27.893 --> 07:31.519
Did you and your husband have kind of a monthly budget?

07:31.899 --> 07:38.910
Yes, Coker's family was able to help us, and that was how we were both able to, you know, attend school.

07:38.930 --> 07:42.375
So that was really nice for us.

07:43.486 --> 07:48.153
Now, and I'm getting ready to chat with you about being a co-ed.

07:48.314 --> 07:48.694
Okay.

07:48.894 --> 07:54.223
Please give as many examples, positive and negative as possible, of what it was like.

07:55.805 --> 07:59.411
You come over, I presume you had already been admitted.

08:00.432 --> 08:01.594
Yes, I was admitted.

08:01.614 --> 08:03.998
That was by mail, I presume.

08:04.338 --> 08:06.642
As far as I can remember, it was.

08:08.056 --> 08:10.840
I don't remember any visits to any place.

08:11.722 --> 08:13.745
And you are, you were a transfer student.

08:13.765 --> 08:14.226
That's right.

08:15.027 --> 08:20.996
And you came over then to register and that was held in Cebisa?

08:21.137 --> 08:21.657
Yes it was.

08:22.479 --> 08:23.020
Describe.

08:23.460 --> 08:33.456
Well, actually it wasn't as bad as what I'd been going through at Tech so, and my husband was there to guide me and

08:34.718 --> 08:42.337
I had been told what I, I had visited with an advisor before I went to register.

08:44.282 --> 08:47.590
And they did not have elementary education.

08:47.850 --> 08:50.938
I mean, they just looked at me like I was

08:52.235 --> 08:58.663
you know, crazy for even thinking that somebody would be at Texas A&M wanting to study elementary education.

08:59.604 --> 09:05.010
And so they suggested I just change my major to education, which I did.

09:05.030 --> 09:11.838
And they told me, they suggested what I should take.

09:12.178 --> 09:21.229
And some of the classes I took, I could never see where, you know, it was really gonna help me.

09:23.234 --> 09:28.122
For instance, they told me that all education majors had to take geography.

09:28.863 --> 09:35.654
And I thought, oh, well, that stands to reason, you know, if we're going to be teaching little ones, we need to know some geography.

09:36.535 --> 09:41.663
Well, so I went to this, so I registered for that, and I went to my first class.

09:42.484 --> 09:48.634
And as I recall, it was taught by, like, a gentleman who was

09:50.538 --> 09:55.322
somebody that had something to do with the Corps of Cadets.

09:55.382 --> 09:58.184
I mean, he came in a uniform, which was fine.

09:58.284 --> 09:59.846
I mean, I didn't have a problem with that.

10:00.546 --> 10:06.511
I was one, I was the only girl in my class of about 20 men.

10:08.313 --> 10:16.480
And so far they have not mentioned any rivers or anything yet about geography, which I consider geography.

10:17.080 --> 10:20.443
These young men, it seemed, were going to be Air Force pilots.

10:21.908 --> 10:25.753
And we talked a lot about clouds and wind currents.

10:26.575 --> 10:30.500
And I mean, I was so lost from the first day.

10:30.520 --> 10:33.024
I just, it was just unreal to me.

10:33.064 --> 10:39.934
And I would go home and I would say, I just know that this is not what I thought geography was.

10:39.954 --> 10:41.015
But I stuck it out.

10:41.977 --> 10:49.367
And one thing about that class that's always sort of tugged at my heart is there I was in 1963.

10:49.347 --> 11:02.309
And all of these young men who were probably about my age were in their corps uniforms and they were going to be going to Vietnam.

11:02.329 --> 11:07.558
And I've always wondered how many of them did not come back.

11:10.812 --> 11:17.239
That was when those same years for me when I went to muster and would hear the roll called.

11:17.879 --> 11:24.426
I would hear some names that I'd had in class maybe only two years at the most before that.

11:24.446 --> 11:25.487
Back to registration.

11:25.547 --> 11:26.508
You stood in line.

11:28.170 --> 11:35.057
Did anybody, were there any pleasantries or unpleasantries that you recall from that first?

11:35.077 --> 11:36.478
I don't remember anybody smiling.

11:36.858 --> 11:37.539
Okay.

11:37.559 --> 11:40.482
They just wanted to sign my little card or

11:40.732 --> 11:46.540
my papers or whatever it was and let me get my money, and that's all they cared about.

11:46.700 --> 11:52.168
So, I mean, and as I remember, because I was a transfer student, I had to go kind of at the end.

11:52.228 --> 11:52.949
Okay.

11:52.969 --> 11:55.393
And there was not the push and shove.

11:55.413 --> 11:56.074
Oh, okay.

11:56.835 --> 12:00.200
Of what it probably was at another time.

12:00.921 --> 12:02.483
And you took a full load.

12:03.084 --> 12:03.424
Yes, sir.

12:03.805 --> 12:04.466
Fifteen hours.

12:04.526 --> 12:05.507
Fifteen hours.

12:05.842 --> 12:12.730
Describe the routine of being a young wife and a full-time student and a housekeeper.

12:13.823 --> 12:24.854
I, it was, you know, it was difficult because it was adjustment of being a wife and then going to school at the same time and everything, but, you know, I managed to do it.

12:27.016 --> 12:30.239
There's not much housekeeping to be done in a little apartment like that.

12:30.539 --> 12:33.762
I did try to spend a lot of time studying.

12:35.063 --> 12:38.527
And, of course, I was wanting my husband to study, too, so.

12:39.488 --> 12:40.649
What was his major?

12:40.689 --> 12:43.071
His major is, uh,

12:44.063 --> 12:44.724
Finance.

12:46.867 --> 12:50.492
And did he continue on the track team after y'all got married?

12:50.512 --> 12:56.141
No, after we were married he dropped off and did not participate in that, right.

12:57.723 --> 13:09.580
Let's see, that first semester were there some people that you met that became and you now realize were very important to you in your A&M experience?

13:10.762 --> 13:13.446
Teachers, friends, advisors?

13:14.405 --> 13:16.110
No, there's really not.

13:16.893 --> 13:22.289
I found that basically they did not want women in their classes.

13:23.533 --> 13:24.516
Give some examples.

13:25.087 --> 13:27.310
Well, I took zoology.

13:27.711 --> 13:37.064
I'd already had biology before I came here, and so they told me I needed another science, and I took zoology.

13:37.104 --> 13:38.607
I was the only girl in the lecture.

13:38.747 --> 13:47.179
It was in a big auditorium, and that was not bad, but in the lab, they

13:47.615 --> 13:52.341
just talked just like they had talked when there was only boys in that class.

13:52.542 --> 14:00.392
And you've got to remember now, this was 1963, and Women's Live had not roused its head.

14:00.432 --> 14:08.203
And there were times it was really hard to step there, but you did it.

14:08.804 --> 14:11.227
Now you're saying both the instructor and the students.

14:11.728 --> 14:12.829
Oh yeah.

14:13.332 --> 14:15.636
Yeah, I mean, that's just the way it was.

14:15.877 --> 14:25.014
And I guess you could say being a submissive person, you just did it.

14:25.155 --> 14:29.062
I mean, nobody hollered harassment in 1963.

14:29.964 --> 14:36.336
And being the only girl, it could have been also that they never even thought about things had changed.

14:36.316 --> 14:41.764
But I often felt like they'd rather not have girls.

14:42.625 --> 14:48.233
Nobody ever, you know, said to me, I don't, I didn't want girls in my class.

14:48.253 --> 14:53.901
But there was just that man's mentality that that's the way it had always been.

14:53.941 --> 15:00.250
And I accept that because there's times when I think it might have been better if girls hadn't come, you know.

15:00.330 --> 15:01.952
I don't want to lose the traditions.

15:02.303 --> 15:04.847
What about in your education classes?

15:04.967 --> 15:07.151
Who, the first ones here?

15:07.572 --> 15:09.295
See, I didn't take any education classes.

15:09.635 --> 15:14.003
I took economics under Mr. Putnam.

15:16.006 --> 15:17.489
Can you describe him?

15:18.891 --> 15:20.734
What a gentleman.

15:22.081 --> 15:27.147
The first day in class, he was probably of a class of about 35.

15:28.549 --> 15:31.733
And he went around and asked everybody their name.

15:31.953 --> 15:35.278
And when I told him my name, he stopped.

15:35.818 --> 15:37.921
And he kind of turned his back to the class.

15:39.283 --> 15:43.147
And he turned around and he said, what's your father-in-law's name?

15:44.830 --> 15:46.111
And I told him what it was.

15:46.392 --> 15:49.135
And he said, oh, OK.

15:50.026 --> 16:04.074
Well, all those boys in the class just went, oh God, she's got an A. Well, it seems that Coach Putnam was a track coach.

16:04.114 --> 16:07.741
And so that was the connection right there.

16:08.302 --> 16:12.270
And he was quite a man.

16:13.718 --> 16:15.561
I learned a lot from him.

16:15.601 --> 16:22.050
I had never had economics except, you know, just high school, but it's barely an economics class.

16:22.090 --> 16:41.278
So I did learn a lot about economics from him, and that was probably the class that was the least offensive, you know, and maybe it was because he knew my father-in-law and he didn't want to say anything that was

16:41.444 --> 16:46.395
Now, by and large, you were quite often the only?

16:46.736 --> 16:48.621
I was the only girl in every class.

16:48.641 --> 16:49.683
In every class.

16:49.703 --> 16:50.585
Every class I went to.

16:50.605 --> 16:52.189
Now, was this the first fall?

16:52.349 --> 16:52.750
Yes.

16:52.770 --> 16:53.071
Okay.

16:53.572 --> 16:57.300
And, of course, you were admitted because your husband was an Aggie student.

16:57.321 --> 16:57.681
Right.

16:57.701 --> 16:57.802
Okay.

16:58.303 --> 16:58.423
Right.

16:58.808 --> 17:06.259
Do you remember any kind of gathering of young coeds early that fall?

17:06.840 --> 17:08.202
Any kind of getting together?

17:08.442 --> 17:26.368
The only thing I ever did was, and it was a wives club, it was the finance wives club and that was the only thing that was girls and as far as I know none of them went to school.

17:27.968 --> 17:33.233
It was difficult to even find a ladies room at that time.

17:34.034 --> 17:35.176
I mean, very difficult.

17:35.336 --> 17:43.744
And between two of my classes, as I remember, I only had one class on Friday morning.

17:43.925 --> 17:50.832
And so on Tuesdays and Thursdays, I had an hour between two of my classes.

17:50.872 --> 17:56.398
And it was hard to even find a place to go and just sit down.

17:56.478 --> 17:57.739
There was nothing.

17:57.719 --> 18:12.184
And finally there was, I believe it was in the academic building, there was a ladies restroom on the first floor and there was chairs and a sofa in there and before the semester over there was about three other

18:13.126 --> 18:16.771
ladies who were considerably older than I was.

18:17.071 --> 18:23.820
I feel sure that they were probably community people who just went to school.

18:24.040 --> 18:27.044
You know, an opportunity was open for them and they went to school.

18:28.726 --> 18:33.533
Would come in, I mean, we could, you know, at least there was a place to sit down for this hour, you know.

18:34.294 --> 18:36.637
But it was, there was not anything.

18:36.937 --> 18:40.602
But nobody said anything because that's just the way it was.

18:40.582 --> 18:43.024
And I presume you walked from Hensel Park?

18:43.745 --> 18:43.885
No.

18:43.905 --> 18:45.046
From, I mean, Hensel Apartments?

18:45.066 --> 18:45.947
No, we rode.

18:45.967 --> 18:46.708
I mean, we drove.

18:46.808 --> 18:47.148
Okay.

18:47.289 --> 18:48.009
Yeah, we drove.

18:48.269 --> 18:51.232
And I'm trying to think where we parked.

18:52.013 --> 18:57.078
It seems like across, oh, I know where we parked.

18:57.979 --> 19:02.383
In the, across from G. Raleigh White was a parking lot.

19:03.024 --> 19:04.245
And that's where we could park in there.

19:04.285 --> 19:04.986
Lot 60.

19:05.706 --> 19:06.147
I don't know.

19:06.207 --> 19:07.488
I just know that's where we could park.

19:09.250 --> 19:09.390
Uh-huh.

19:09.640 --> 19:17.402
So describe the routine of a typical Monday through Friday day for you.

19:18.004 --> 19:20.511
Got up what time and got to campus?

19:20.997 --> 19:27.187
Well, we're both kind of early risers, and so we always had at least classes by 9 o'clock.

19:27.267 --> 19:38.165
I mean, you know, we were, and usually, I believe that I was always through by noon on all my classes.

19:38.285 --> 19:46.498
And I think that was another thing that was kind of surprising to register late like that and be able to, you know, have off your classes over in the morning.

19:48.166 --> 19:53.253
Except I believe my zoology lab was like on a Tuesday afternoon.

19:53.774 --> 19:57.499
You know, it was like four hours on a Tuesday afternoon or something like that.

19:57.539 --> 20:08.335
But most of my classes were in the morning and got up, got breakfast, went to school, came home, ate lunch, studied, did all those other things that you do.

20:09.985 --> 20:12.768
you know, enjoyed some of the campus life, of course.

20:12.788 --> 20:18.774
Describe the campus, the major campus buildings when you first got here.

20:19.395 --> 20:20.396
What were the places made you?

20:20.416 --> 20:29.205
Well, I had, well, I had geography, that wonderful geography class, and the history building, I believe it was called.

20:29.285 --> 20:29.786
Nagel Hall.

20:29.846 --> 20:30.867
Okay, Nagel Hall.

20:31.888 --> 20:34.491
And then, I believe,

20:35.534 --> 20:42.926
I don't remember what building I had zoology in, but I had other classes in the academic building, I believe.

20:44.949 --> 20:47.934
The English and the economics class.

20:50.218 --> 20:52.502
Did you and your husband come to the MSC much?

20:53.183 --> 20:53.664
Oh, yes.

20:54.004 --> 20:55.307
Everybody came to the MSC.

20:55.327 --> 21:00.495
I mean, it was a hub, I guess you would say.

21:02.416 --> 21:10.310
I mean, it was just, it's kind of hard to describe the camaraderie that you get to be a part of.

21:10.430 --> 21:17.944
But right now, you know, as my husband says, nobody bleeds maroon more than Jane does.

21:18.734 --> 21:21.821
Let me, as an aside, tell you this one.

21:21.841 --> 21:28.918
In doing these interviews, one of the people I interviewed was former Speaker Clayton, former Speaker of the House, Billy Clayton.

21:30.402 --> 21:33.790
He indicated that he was in the legislature

21:34.259 --> 21:37.744
when this decision was made for women to be admitted.

21:38.605 --> 21:43.572
It was his first term and he said he opposed it, but he didn't publicly do anything.

21:44.833 --> 21:47.537
And I said, oh really?

21:47.617 --> 21:48.779
Why did you oppose it?

21:48.899 --> 21:52.444
And he said, I thought the women wouldn't have any spirit as Aggies.

21:53.225 --> 21:54.867
And I grinned

21:54.847 --> 21:58.495
And he said, well, do the coeds have any Aggie pride now?

21:58.635 --> 22:02.243
And I said, sir, as far as I can tell, the women have more than the men do.

22:02.684 --> 22:08.957
And he quickly hit the table with a smile, hit his fist on a smile, and he said, good, because my three granddaughters are all there.

22:09.207 --> 22:18.885
The, as you first were here, did fish say hello to you on the sidewalk?

22:18.925 --> 22:20.588
Did people greet coeds?

22:21.089 --> 22:25.056
Yes, that was one thing that will always

22:25.373 --> 22:33.343
you know, stand out in my mind is the respectfulness of the Corps.

22:34.044 --> 22:36.947
I mean, they just, I mean, they held doors for women.

22:37.448 --> 22:50.384
I'm not sure they do it in 19, or 2000, but in 1963, they still had a lot of respect for women, even though I felt like they really did not want girls in their domain.

22:51.145 --> 22:53.828
They were respectful, they would,

22:54.179 --> 23:00.028
nod to you, you know, howdy, hold doors for you.

23:01.670 --> 23:04.955
If you dropped your pencil on the floor, they would pick it up for you.

23:05.275 --> 23:08.981
I mean, it was a very polite society.

23:09.742 --> 23:19.376
Did anyone, did any young man, perhaps not aware that you were married, ever try to wink or ask for a date or anything like that?

23:19.416 --> 23:19.737
No.

23:21.399 --> 23:21.559
Okay.

23:21.579 --> 23:23.983
No, not that, no, it never happened.

23:24.335 --> 23:32.433
And let's see, did you all eat in the MSC cafeteria or anything like that?

23:34.056 --> 23:38.125
Oh, we might have on occasion, but usually we just, you know, ate at home.

23:39.556 --> 23:43.362
All right, so you were in class here two years?

23:43.883 --> 23:44.564
One semester.

23:44.965 --> 23:45.525
Oh, one semester?

23:45.545 --> 23:46.247
One semester.

23:46.487 --> 23:46.627
Oh.

23:47.168 --> 24:04.956
Okay, I, yes, we laid out of, we went that first semester and then we did not go the next semester and then we came back and in the meantime I had gotten pregnant and the baby was due in December and, you know, I just did not go back to school.

24:04.936 --> 24:07.399
All right, did you live back in the Hensel again?

24:07.880 --> 24:08.300
Yes, we did.

24:08.440 --> 24:09.081
The second time?

24:09.101 --> 24:09.542
Yes, we did.

24:10.483 --> 24:18.874
All right, so with that schedule, and now were the other young wives around you, were they helpful to this expectant mother?

24:19.415 --> 24:20.916
Yes, they were.

24:21.637 --> 24:27.905
Well, more helpful to me after I became a mother.

24:27.925 --> 24:28.947
Oh, okay.

24:28.967 --> 24:29.948
I mean, I had never...

24:30.367 --> 24:31.649
I had never been around babies.

24:31.909 --> 24:38.477
I had a little nephew, but I had never really, I mean, it's just one of those things that happen to you, you know.

24:40.400 --> 24:48.009
And, I mean, the lady downstairs for me, if she, I don't know what I would have done without her.

24:48.089 --> 24:51.193
I mean, the first time the baby was sick, I didn't,

24:51.747 --> 24:53.189
I just didn't even know what to do.

24:53.690 --> 24:54.591
And she was so good.

24:54.651 --> 24:59.978
And she was a mother with two children, and she was able to help me, you know.

25:00.119 --> 25:04.404
But I only actually attended school that one semester at A&M.

25:05.065 --> 25:06.728
The baby was born here?

25:06.828 --> 25:07.048
Yes.

25:07.569 --> 25:11.955
Dr. Roman, bless his little heart, he delivered my little Leanne.

25:12.095 --> 25:13.096
Bill Roman.

25:13.297 --> 25:13.437
Uh-huh.

25:13.457 --> 25:15.379
Describe his thoughtfulness.

25:15.399 --> 25:17.903
Oh, Dr. Roman, what can you say about that man?

25:18.324 --> 25:19.425
He is a case.

25:20.300 --> 25:26.249
He was just the jolliest, funniest fella I've ever known.

25:27.130 --> 25:38.207
And the day I was in the hospital delivering her, he sat on the end of my bed and told the sisters dirty jokes.

25:39.065 --> 25:49.342
I don't know if he wants that on the tape or not, but, I mean, you may not want to do that, but it was just, I mean, he was a light in our life.

25:49.402 --> 25:50.564
He really was, you know.

25:50.805 --> 25:51.526
Describe St.

25:51.566 --> 25:53.029
Joseph Hospital at that point.

25:53.209 --> 25:55.673
It was a very old,

25:55.653 --> 26:03.489
She was born December the 5th and it was the first, it snowed while I was there.

26:03.549 --> 26:09.441
First time in 25 years that it had snowed in College Station, Texas.

26:09.461 --> 26:11.164
And it was very, very cold.

26:12.545 --> 26:14.468
That's the old St.

26:14.508 --> 26:20.618
Joseph just north of downtown instead of south.

26:23.142 --> 26:29.472
Back to that fall when you were young, newlywed, you went to football games.

26:29.512 --> 26:30.013
Yes, I did.

26:30.273 --> 26:33.338
Describe going to your first Aggie football game.

26:34.077 --> 26:37.240
Well, I mean, I just loved it.

26:37.961 --> 26:41.485
It was just the most exciting thing that I'd ever done in my whole life.

26:42.346 --> 26:48.393
And I told my husband at that time, I said, I will be glad.

26:48.413 --> 26:50.955
I mean, you know, got tired of standing.

26:53.258 --> 26:54.299
But I was a good sport.

26:54.579 --> 27:00.726
And I told my husband, I said, we've got to graduate so we can have a chair.

27:00.706 --> 27:04.291
And I just loved it.

27:04.631 --> 27:13.742
I just, the spirit, the, I don't, it's just hard for me to have words to describe how wonderful I think this place is.

27:13.762 --> 27:15.805
Did you all go to midnight yell practice?

27:15.845 --> 27:17.207
Oh yes, of course.

27:17.267 --> 27:19.389
We did all those things.

27:20.291 --> 27:27.760
Now were there any traditions, whether real or imaginary, were there any traditions at A&M

27:28.128 --> 27:30.813
that you did not know about until you got here?

27:31.815 --> 27:34.961
Yes, the fish dunking the hill leaders.

27:35.422 --> 27:36.444
I did not know about that.

27:37.326 --> 27:48.347
I mean, I had been to other, at Tech, I had been to football games where the Aggies were there, but it's a lot different, you know, at that campus.

27:48.395 --> 27:52.142
And you knew what happened after the Aggies score?

27:52.422 --> 27:53.865
Yes, yes.

27:53.885 --> 27:55.468
I already knew that.

27:55.488 --> 28:01.279
I've always wondered what would be the reaction of a young woman who had a blind date and didn't know that tradition.

28:01.299 --> 28:04.164
Well, I'm sure that happened over the years.

28:04.184 --> 28:04.705
Let's see.

28:04.745 --> 28:08.091
Other traditions that impressed you?

28:09.455 --> 28:16.165
Oh, I think one thing that really impressed me as much as anything is the tradition of the ring.

28:18.087 --> 28:23.595
That was really a highlight in my husband's life when he got that senior ring.

28:23.716 --> 28:25.578
I mean, it was a biggie.

28:26.399 --> 28:27.281
How much did it cost?

28:28.462 --> 28:32.408
You know, I don't know, but I would guess that it wasn't

28:34.143 --> 28:39.888
I would guess around maybe $25 to $35, but I wouldn't know if that was right or not.

28:40.489 --> 28:42.691
It wasn't an astronomical amount of money.

28:42.711 --> 28:48.697
Are there any ring stories in your family of where it was lost or somebody spotted it?

28:49.537 --> 28:50.178
There sure is.

28:50.218 --> 29:03.070
Now that you say that, my husband graduated and he got his first job and as fate would have it, it was back in Andrews working for an oil company.

29:04.889 --> 29:21.950
The oil company, there was really no young, really young ones like we were, but they had a lot of friendships, and they had office parties, and one day we went out to an office party at a park, and there was a volleyball game, and my husband lost his Aggie ring.

29:22.771 --> 29:30.981
Well, I mean, it was the saddest, we were just heartbroken, and everybody just walked and walked and walked until we found that Aggie ring.

29:31.433 --> 29:40.554
And, you know, and then we've had, he's had one stolen also when our house was robbed, so that was really sad, but... Wait, oh, and it was stolen?

29:40.694 --> 29:41.395
Yes.

29:41.416 --> 29:42.177
Oh.

29:42.197 --> 29:43.039
Yes, it was stolen.

29:44.322 --> 29:45.645
He had...

29:47.465 --> 29:50.569
He had been given some savings bonds, I believe, when he was born.

29:50.970 --> 29:53.113
And he had never cashed them.

29:53.133 --> 29:57.319
And so he took the savings bonds and bought a diamond to go in his Aggie ring.

29:58.501 --> 30:01.365
And he lost the diamond out of that Aggie ring.

30:01.605 --> 30:03.488
And they were so expensive to buy.

30:03.708 --> 30:08.555
I mean, it was so expensive to replace the diamond, it was cheaper for him to buy a new Aggie ring.

30:09.417 --> 30:10.518
And so that's what he did.

30:10.578 --> 30:11.700
So he had two.

30:12.980 --> 30:28.660
And he lost some weight, and he couldn't wear the second one, so I gave him the original diamond out of my engagement ring to put in that Aggie ring, because I wanted him to wear that Aggie ring.

30:29.602 --> 30:31.846
He had been wearing that, and he gained the weight back.

30:32.147 --> 30:35.594
And the one with the diamond, the first one, was in.

30:35.754 --> 30:42.587
We had moved from West Texas back to Houston, and it had not been put in the lockbox, and our home was burglarized.

30:42.728 --> 30:45.613
And so somebody's wearing an Aggie ring.

30:46.315 --> 30:47.998
It shouldn't be.

30:49.008 --> 30:51.573
Let's see, back to A&M days.

30:53.357 --> 31:01.273
Do you remember any, either direct or indirect, do you remember any kind of Aggie Good Bull?

31:01.394 --> 31:05.903
Jokes, pranks that you all knew about?

31:06.085 --> 31:16.118
Of course, when we were here is the times that all of the mascots were being stolen.

31:16.278 --> 31:32.920
And it was just really exciting when they started, I think it was Mr. Lupot that had sort of maybe helped with that when they stole Bevo and they couldn't find him and there was just reports on the radio about

31:32.900 --> 31:41.027
Well, he was sighted at such and such out here south of town or such and such north of town, you know, and it was kind of a stink, but it was really fun.

31:43.209 --> 31:46.111
I had some of those students in class, I learned later.

31:46.992 --> 31:52.176
Well, and my husband said, had he not been married, he would have probably been involved in anything.

31:52.196 --> 31:54.638
And today, of course, those kids would get kicked out of school.

31:54.658 --> 31:54.758
Yeah.

31:55.179 --> 31:56.360
This would be horrible.

31:57.400 --> 32:01.804
What did a young married co-ed wear to class?

32:01.844 --> 32:02.805
How did you dress?

32:03.022 --> 32:07.727
Well, just like I did before I was at A&M.

32:07.807 --> 32:11.891
I wore loafers and socks and skirts and sweaters.

32:12.732 --> 32:13.673
But not slacks.

32:13.693 --> 32:14.774
No slacks.

32:14.814 --> 32:15.294
No slacks.

32:15.875 --> 32:16.956
No jeans, no slacks.

32:18.518 --> 32:20.079
That's what I thought.

32:20.780 --> 32:25.565
And how did you carry your books and stuff to class?

32:26.426 --> 32:27.627
Just carried them in my arms.

32:27.687 --> 32:28.928
I didn't have a backpack.

32:29.887 --> 32:33.873
Today's youngsters can't imagine that they could exist without a backpack.

32:33.893 --> 32:34.194
Right.

32:36.096 --> 32:44.129
Let's see, were there any other teachers or advisors that you had that semester that we haven't mentioned so far?

32:44.149 --> 32:53.042
Well, there is a man that was my English professor and I, for the life of me, we have not been able to think of his name.

32:53.022 --> 32:55.105
But he was very good.

32:55.186 --> 32:57.750
I have to say that I believe my professors were very good.

32:57.810 --> 33:02.818
And I learned from them.

33:03.720 --> 33:07.185
This gentleman, he was a little fella.

33:07.426 --> 33:08.267
He wasn't very tall.

33:08.488 --> 33:11.833
And I remember that he had the darkest circles under his eyes.

33:11.953 --> 33:13.195
I never will forget that.

33:13.215 --> 33:14.237
Wasn't it Louie Hauer?

33:14.707 --> 33:15.369
I don't know.

33:15.389 --> 33:21.367
This man was, of course, I was young and thought he was probably really old.

33:21.427 --> 33:24.476
And he probably really wasn't old.

33:24.496 --> 33:28.227
But he was, it was the literature.

33:28.325 --> 33:39.547
And I learned so much from him about, he was really big on symbolism and how it affects the story that the author is telling.

33:39.787 --> 33:45.659
And even today when I read, I think, I wonder what that's a symbol for, you know?

33:46.240 --> 33:48.264
So I think I really took something from that class.

33:48.304 --> 33:50.468
He was a man that was,

33:51.258 --> 33:54.243
very involved with the Alley Theater in Houston.

33:55.164 --> 33:57.969
And I mean, that's where he spent his weekends.

33:58.009 --> 34:01.174
I mean, he was really into this.

34:01.214 --> 34:04.118
But I just can't remember his name, but he was a very good teacher.

34:04.138 --> 34:06.141
But again, I was the only girl in that class.

34:09.807 --> 34:10.648
So let's see.

34:11.330 --> 34:12.912
You didn't know any of this.

34:13.111 --> 34:14.254
He didn't have a nickname.

34:14.574 --> 34:17.321
At about that time, the faculty nicknames began to disappear.

34:17.341 --> 34:21.190
Right, and you know, he probably did, but I do not know.

34:21.210 --> 34:24.217
I just don't know what his name was.

34:24.738 --> 34:29.770
Compare the academic rigor of the courses here with what you had had at Tech.

34:33.057 --> 34:34.499
Any difference?

34:34.840 --> 34:38.806
I can't say that there was much difference.

34:38.906 --> 34:44.554
I mean, I was taking things that were geared for one way at Tech and then I'm here.

34:44.955 --> 34:58.575
It's more like I had become an adult when I came here because, I mean, I was taking economics and not children's literature and geography that really wasn't geography to me, you know.

34:58.555 --> 35:01.859
So it was like I had gone from a child to an adult.

35:01.879 --> 35:12.033
And so in terms of whatever grades you made, what it took to make that grade wasn't particularly different here, the grading?

35:12.253 --> 35:13.935
It might have been a little tougher, I think.

35:13.955 --> 35:14.456
Is that right?

35:14.476 --> 35:14.676
Oh, okay.

35:14.696 --> 35:17.379
I think it might have been a little tougher.

35:17.440 --> 35:20.884
Maybe they, I don't know, maybe they...

35:22.518 --> 35:33.576
I don't want to say they expected more, but maybe they, I mean at A&M, but maybe they, it was just maybe the mentality of the military part.

35:34.598 --> 35:37.482
Did you have the impression that you were expected to be in class every day?

35:38.204 --> 35:42.130
Oh, yes, sir, but I was raised where you sign up for a job, you do the job.

35:44.084 --> 35:50.973
The MSC, what role did it play in students' lives as far as you were?

35:50.993 --> 35:51.875
It was like the hub.

35:52.516 --> 35:57.422
I remember the mailbox was there.

35:57.763 --> 36:03.831
Well, we didn't because we got mail delivery, but before I came, I know that my husband had a mailbox

36:04.182 --> 36:15.865
there that he would go to check the PO as he says and there was a really nice gift shop in there and if we had to have a gift we could go in there and get that gift.

36:15.885 --> 36:17.648
You could eat and you could meet your friends.

36:17.728 --> 36:20.914
I mean it was important.

36:21.616 --> 36:22.878
MSC was very important.

36:23.098 --> 36:24.942
Did you all go to any concerts?

36:26.018 --> 36:31.024
Oh yeah, we went to see the Lucy Ann Hayride.

36:31.064 --> 36:33.607
I think we saw that twice.

36:33.627 --> 36:38.773
And once Jerry Lee Lewis was there, and that was just the wildest thing I'd ever seen in my whole life.

36:39.654 --> 36:41.055
But that was really good.

36:41.115 --> 36:43.919
I mean, it was full when we went.

36:44.920 --> 36:49.425
Now how did Aggies behave at concerts and things like that?

36:50.687 --> 36:55.452
Well, I think they behaved like, probably not like kids do today.

36:55.617 --> 37:08.329
But like, I mean, they had a great time and were responsive to the people that were performing, you know, but they were also polite.

37:09.289 --> 37:11.231
I mean, that's just how Aggies are.

37:11.251 --> 37:12.612
They were just polite.

37:13.613 --> 37:16.676
Let's see, did y'all participate in any religious activities?

37:17.136 --> 37:18.237
Yes, we went to church here.

37:18.778 --> 37:18.978
Which?

37:19.439 --> 37:23.262
It was a Baptist church, and I cannot...

37:24.035 --> 37:27.801
Was it at Northgate or First Baptist Church?

37:27.821 --> 37:29.523
I think that's where it was, it was at Northgate.

37:29.784 --> 37:32.247
That was the First Baptist, now they moved south.

37:32.267 --> 37:34.030
Okay, I believe it was the First Baptist.

37:34.050 --> 37:38.276
Describe to a young, newlywed going church there what it was like.

37:38.296 --> 37:52.658
Well, as I remember, there wasn't a lot of, of course we didn't go like we should have, but there was not a lot of students there that was mostly older people.

37:54.916 --> 37:57.941
Did the church follow up?

37:58.122 --> 37:59.905
Did anyone ever call on y'all?

38:00.065 --> 38:01.507
I can't remember that.

38:02.088 --> 38:03.491
I don't remember that.

38:04.813 --> 38:06.336
And let's see.

38:07.197 --> 38:12.927
Oh, did you go to Silver Taps ever?

38:12.947 --> 38:15.552
I don't think I ever went to a Silver Taps.

38:15.832 --> 38:19.118
I know that we could hear

38:20.043 --> 38:25.750
the bugles playing on our balcony at Hensel Apartments.

38:27.592 --> 38:45.634
And how, I mean, you know, it was a, it got, it was dark, and we could hear the, we could hear, of course, that was, I mean, that's been a long time ago, and there was no, not that, the cars were not, it wasn't a metropolitan area like it is now, yeah.

38:46.035 --> 38:47.096
What about Mustard?

38:47.637 --> 38:48.598
Did y'all go to Mustard?

38:48.798 --> 38:50.781
I don't remember going to muster.

38:59.335 --> 39:02.720
When he graduated, describe commencement.

39:05.224 --> 39:11.674
It seems like it was in G. Raleigh White and we were so excited.

39:11.934 --> 39:14.839
I can't even tell you how excited we were.

39:17.182 --> 39:26.685
And it seems like that he, and why I remember this, I don't know, but the president of Campbell Soup spoke.

39:28.015 --> 39:29.617
Oh, it was just a glorious day.

39:29.637 --> 39:31.820
And we had a family picnic.

39:32.100 --> 39:37.627
Afterwards, my husband graduated, and then my brother-in-law graduated.

39:37.728 --> 39:39.950
I mean, they graduated at the same time.

39:40.591 --> 39:44.496
And we had a family picnic, and it was just a wonderful day.

39:44.657 --> 39:57.313
And one of my very favorite little snapshots I have is of my husband holding our little girl, who was at that time about 12 months old, I guess, in his cap and gown.

39:57.293 --> 40:00.338
And I think that's the only picture we have of him in his cap and gown.

40:01.040 --> 40:02.602
But it was a wonderful day.

40:02.763 --> 40:07.932
And there wasn't that many people that even came to graduation.

40:08.112 --> 40:09.435
I mean, there was plenty of seats.

40:10.036 --> 40:15.285
We sat up in the stands, and then the graduates are down on the floor.

40:17.003 --> 40:22.330
I don't even, I would think, I can't remember, but it seems like everybody graduated at one time.

40:23.030 --> 40:27.416
I mean, everybody, there wasn't, there was just one, wasn't there?

40:28.237 --> 40:30.900
And it seems like there was even empty chairs on the floor.

40:31.361 --> 40:32.722
But every name was called.

40:32.742 --> 40:33.724
Every name was called.

40:33.824 --> 40:34.645
Every hand shaken.

40:34.745 --> 40:36.267
Every hand shaken, you're right.

40:36.848 --> 40:41.273
And he looked quickly inside the tube to be sure his diploma was in there.

40:41.557 --> 40:42.298
Exactly.

40:42.338 --> 40:44.341
Exactly.

40:44.381 --> 40:48.347
Now, he was not in the Corps the last two years.

40:48.367 --> 40:48.888
That's right.

40:49.429 --> 40:49.689
Okay.

40:50.831 --> 40:52.253
So there wasn't a commissioning ceremony?

40:52.273 --> 40:53.054
No, there was not.

40:54.877 --> 41:01.707
There was a time that I really wanted him to get back into the Corps.

41:02.268 --> 41:09.859
I mean, I thought that'd be a great way to maybe travel and things like that, and I don't think he really ever seriously considered it, but

41:12.370 --> 41:21.780
I guess I, in a selfish way, I'm glad he didn't because at the time we were really talking about it was the time of the Bay of Tonkin, I believe it's called.

41:22.160 --> 41:24.363
And that was, you know, a real turning point.

41:26.445 --> 41:32.251
I'm looking at other notes here for potential comments.

41:32.932 --> 41:35.555
What did you think of Aggie Yell leaders?

41:35.575 --> 41:36.856
Oh, I thought they were just fine.

41:38.898 --> 41:40.740
I thought they were a leader.

41:41.513 --> 41:45.217
Did you ever hear any talk about why weren't there women yell leaders?

41:46.018 --> 41:49.982
No, but I'll be the first to say I hope there's never a woman yell leader.

41:51.723 --> 41:55.487
I don't know that there's ever been a woman attempt to be.

41:55.607 --> 41:56.588
I don't think that.

41:56.608 --> 41:59.992
I mean, some things are just sacred as far as I'm concerned.

42:00.012 --> 42:03.796
I mean, it was hard enough when the band had girls.

42:03.816 --> 42:05.297
I sound like I'm on the other side, don't I?

42:06.678 --> 42:11.183
Did you ever hear any mention of secret fraternities here?

42:16.259 --> 42:17.580
No, I don't believe I did.

42:17.600 --> 42:33.356
I remember that everybody that I knew and associated with us thought that fraternities and sororities were only for cookie-pusher schools.

42:33.376 --> 42:42.064
Apparently, there have been at various times two ultra-ultra-secret groups, one called the TTs, True Texans,

42:43.208 --> 42:53.010
and the other, the stickers, and this one goes way back to the 20s, maybe to the teens, and their symbol was the swastika.

42:53.030 --> 42:54.634
Oh man, how awful.

42:54.654 --> 42:56.899
But this is before the Nazi party discovered it.

42:56.939 --> 42:58.382
Right, right.

42:58.750 --> 43:08.584
The only purpose of either organization was to get one of their own to be corps commander, senior class president, and so forth.

43:08.604 --> 43:13.491
It was for leadership, but it was to be one of our guys to be leadership.

43:13.511 --> 43:14.693
Well, that would not surprise me.

43:14.974 --> 43:16.155
Things like that do happen.

43:16.616 --> 43:23.526
And so far in doing all these interviews, I have never interviewed anybody who really knows anything about it.

43:23.506 --> 43:32.135
They say, well, I understand that there might have been, and two or three people that I've interviewed I think are certain to have been members.

43:33.857 --> 43:43.367
Let's see, the Hensel Park was pretty well full in those days, but it's all the apartments.

43:43.387 --> 43:44.248
Oh, yeah.

43:44.268 --> 43:50.374
Oh, yeah, that was, I mean, that was really considered,

43:51.788 --> 43:52.509
Fine living.

43:52.709 --> 43:53.169
Yeah.

43:53.189 --> 43:53.810
It really was.

43:54.150 --> 44:01.718
About what percentage, you said there were some international couples, as you would recall, about what percentage were U.S.

44:02.739 --> 44:04.822
students and what percentage?

44:05.102 --> 44:06.643
Oh, I would say it was 98% U.S.

44:06.664 --> 44:08.005
U.S., okay.

44:08.305 --> 44:16.294
And, but there were some foreign students and I mean that was really foreign to me.

44:16.334 --> 44:19.977
And were most of them undergraduates?

44:19.997 --> 44:21.559
I do not know the answer to that.

44:22.197 --> 44:24.540
And there were not any... They were families.

44:25.200 --> 44:25.340
Yeah.

44:25.360 --> 44:28.944
So I would, if I were thinking about it, I would say they were probably graduate students.

44:28.964 --> 44:29.064
Okay.

44:29.745 --> 44:36.372
And were there any activities to try to get all of the Hensel apartment students together?

44:37.113 --> 44:38.535
If there were, I never heard of them.

44:38.555 --> 44:43.480
There wasn't a picnic or a... Not that I ever heard of, uh-uh.

44:43.500 --> 44:46.443
When you went shopping, where did you go to buy?

44:46.463 --> 44:48.846
Oh, that was a...

44:49.163 --> 44:53.771
I will never forget that that wine garden supermarket was the biggest thing I'd ever seen in my life.

44:53.791 --> 44:55.895
Of course, I was from the country, so.

44:56.596 --> 45:02.487
But we went to the little shopping center that's... Manor East.

45:02.627 --> 45:02.908
Yes.

45:03.529 --> 45:04.571
I did not know the name of it.

45:04.611 --> 45:06.194
Right, that's exactly where we went.

45:06.474 --> 45:08.458
It had opened in the late 50s.

45:08.919 --> 45:09.720
Okay.

45:10.358 --> 45:14.383
And because we got here in 59 and we thought it was a big shopping center.

45:14.463 --> 45:17.446
Yeah, it was a really nice place to go shop, you're right.

45:17.567 --> 45:20.230
So you bought groceries at Manor East.

45:20.250 --> 45:25.276
If you were going to buy any ladies' clothing, where did you shop?

45:25.937 --> 45:28.620
Well, you didn't buy any.

45:28.640 --> 45:29.821
I don't remember buying any.

45:30.782 --> 45:37.210
I do remember there was an SNH green stamp store right there.

45:38.641 --> 45:40.545
but don't really remember buying any clothes.

45:40.966 --> 45:53.872
I do remember that there was a Penny's in downtown Bryan, but that's, you know, I just didn't, shopping wasn't then like it is now.

45:54.794 --> 45:59.383
Now, I know you didn't, your budget didn't allow you to eat out much, but when you all ate out, where did you go?

46:00.832 --> 46:05.197
It seems like there was a, what is it called?

46:06.038 --> 46:10.404
Was it Shipley's that had the double-faced hamburgers?

46:10.484 --> 46:17.412
I mean, it was two pieces of bread, two pieces of meat, and two pieces, and they came and it was covered with French fries.

46:17.513 --> 46:20.156
That's Shipley's, I believe, is where we would.

46:21.938 --> 46:27.565
As far as you know, where did the students go to have a big time on a Saturday night?

46:28.253 --> 46:29.075
Oh, man.

46:29.716 --> 46:36.569
Now, if my husband was here, he could probably tell you, but after we got married, there wasn't many big times on Saturday night.

46:37.330 --> 46:40.997
I know that I've heard stories about how they all went to Snook.

46:42.380 --> 46:43.242
The Whiskey Bridge.

46:43.763 --> 46:46.247
Well, I just know it's called Snook.

46:46.267 --> 46:48.692
I don't know what it was or where, yeah.

46:49.330 --> 46:54.360
Because the first, the county west of us, you could buy a whiskey.

46:54.380 --> 46:55.442
Okay, okay.

46:55.462 --> 46:56.625
And right across the river.

46:56.685 --> 46:57.146
That's right.

46:57.486 --> 46:58.148
I remember that.

46:58.388 --> 46:58.889
Yes, I do.

46:58.969 --> 47:01.755
There was a little country store there at Whiskey Bridge.

47:01.895 --> 47:05.542
But I think there must have been a dance hall at Snook or something.

47:06.003 --> 47:07.947
Or SPJ.

47:07.927 --> 47:11.092
Yes, or something right.

47:12.054 --> 47:21.410
Now, I have never heard any mention of any kind of place where women were available for Aggie students.

47:21.430 --> 47:22.913
You as a young woman, you didn't hear.

47:23.494 --> 47:24.415
I've never heard of such.

47:24.996 --> 47:27.741
There was a place for beer.
