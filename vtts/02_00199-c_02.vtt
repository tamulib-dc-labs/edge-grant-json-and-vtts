00:02.731 --> 00:07.560
What feelings do you carry in your heart about Texas A&M?

00:08.402 --> 00:10.125
Well, I'm just an Aggie.

00:10.946 --> 00:12.389
I'm a full-blooded Aggie.

00:13.331 --> 00:25.093
I went to school at the University of Texas for five years, and I've been at A&M for about 40 years, and I'm just like an Aggie.

00:26.744 --> 00:34.657
I read the paper every day to find out how the women did in tennis and everything, and I think our athletic program is the highest right now.

00:34.797 --> 00:40.887
I mean, every one of our sports is in the top 20, top 10, top 20.

00:42.009 --> 00:51.705
We've got women, you know, women has really went great, and I think Texas A&M is, we're

00:51.685 --> 00:55.231
Still on the ride, we're getting better all the time.

00:55.832 --> 00:57.134
Every sport's getting better.

00:57.835 --> 01:00.941
And I think getting in the Big 12 is the best thing that we ever did.

01:00.961 --> 01:02.784
I really do.

01:03.385 --> 01:06.750
I mean, now we've got to compete against Kansas.

01:06.770 --> 01:12.099
We've got to compete against Colorado, you know, Nebraska, in every sport.

01:12.179 --> 01:14.864
And that puts us on the map.

01:15.545 --> 01:17.929
It puts Texas A&M at the top.

01:17.909 --> 01:24.190
You either go to A&M or you got to go to Tennessee or, you know, or Harvard.

01:25.012 --> 01:26.417
Let's quit there then.
