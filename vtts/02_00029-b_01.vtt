WEBVTT

00:01.680 --> 00:08.660
Full-time center managers, and they had their 
respective areas that they were out constantly

00:01.680 --> 00:08.660
seeing what we could do. Need study, learn need 
study topics. And then the divisions, so we

00:11.620 --> 00:16.440
wouldn't have any conflict with the divisions, 
they signed their staff to that center. And those

00:16.980 --> 00:20.540
staff didn't report it to any manager. The center 
manager had no administrative control over any of

00:20.640 --> 00:23.180
the people. Provided need

00:25.870 --> 00:54.800
studies, a

00:25.870 --> 00:54.800
lot of good, and we had those available. When we 
started

00:54.920 --> 01:27.800
to offer the agency,

00:54.920 --> 01:27.800
the independent

00:54.920 --> 01:27.800
drillers

00:54.920 --> 01:27.800
came. So I said, well,

01:27.780 --> 01:39.180
here's

01:27.780 --> 01:39.180
what you're going to take. And I said, give us the, 
they underwrote the program.

01:58.290 --> 01:59.671
We believe you don't have anything. Looking

02:00.390 --> 02:43.540
back on those 19 years, is there any area of 
service, and I don't mean geographic area, but any

02:00.390 --> 02:43.540
topic, that you wish you all could have done more?

02:52.480 --> 02:56.820
Were you frustrated that you couldn't have served 
this or this or this industry?

03:01.220 --> 03:04.360
See, the Engineering Containment Service is the 
only agency in the state of Texas. They have a

03:04.460 --> 03:05.461
statewide mandate.

03:15.140 --> 03:20.340
And normally, in all those cases, there's some 
trade association or something.

03:24.860 --> 03:27.580
What were your favorite groups to work with?

03:31.030 --> 03:33.670
There must have been some that were more pleasant 
than others, though. Who

03:33.810 --> 03:51.750
were the key state officials?

03:56.350 --> 03:57.751
I don't know if you can name your favorites. The 
ones that you would say thank you to. I guess the

04:03.450 --> 04:17.950
one, Joe

04:03.450 --> 04:17.950
Reynolds.

04:18.090 --> 04:21.170
See, Joe Reynolds and White was in the law 
practice. And White was his new mate. He was the

04:25.700 --> 04:39.630
Secretary of State, because I knew White when he 
was on the run for governor. I felt that he's the

04:39.610 --> 04:43.430
only governor I really, really knew. You know, for 
any, I've known all the governors, but I mean, to

04:43.410 --> 04:49.500
really know them. So I guess that's one reason I 
felt it close to him. You

04:52.280 --> 05:00.050
know, Preston helped me out an awful lot. Any time I 
wanted to form him with any senator or

05:00.030 --> 05:05.370
representative, I could call him Bill, he'd hand 
it for me. This is while he was... State Chairman,

05:07.350 --> 05:12.510
was he, well, while he was a representative, and as 
he served, you know, he served his term as the state

05:07.350 --> 05:12.510
of Texas. The House Appropriation Committee for 
about 10 or 12 years. Whenever I wanted to form him

05:15.490 --> 05:22.860
with any senator or House of Representatives, I'd 
call him Bill, and he'd hand it for me. Of course,

05:22.840 --> 05:28.330
Bill Moore, he was in the Senate. I had done a lot of 
other work for Bill Moore on his outside, and he had

05:28.310 --> 05:38.980
that back of A&M on him for charge, and that back of 
A&M was Bill, and he helped everybody out with

05:28.310 --> 05:38.980
that. Can you, can you give me an example of... 
lobbying at work, where you called somebody, and

05:44.840 --> 05:49.860
they made the wheels turn? Give, take, describe. 
For a specific project? If you, if there was one.

05:58.340 --> 06:00.360
You can think of them. Yeah,

06:00.340 --> 06:20.430
a bunch

06:00.340 --> 06:20.430
of volunteer

06:00.340 --> 06:20.430
fire departments.

06:20.410 --> 07:00.820
It takes

06:20.410 --> 07:00.820
them to

06:20.410 --> 07:00.820
tie in with

06:20.410 --> 07:00.820
Harris

06:20.410 --> 07:00.820
County.

07:00.800 --> 07:05.730
It's a very expensive training program. You've 
got to have good training to be damn careful. And I

07:12.920 --> 07:15.940
said, it's true, the fuel's expensive, and you've 
got to burn. You can't just light a match and say,

07:15.920 --> 07:18.940
here, now we're gonna go put it out. I said, you've 
got to, if you're gonna have any fire training, or

07:18.920 --> 07:24.540
those types of training, you've got to have 
hands-on training. They've got to smell the heat

07:24.520 --> 07:27.490
and see what's going on. But anyway, so, the way I 
stopped

07:27.470 --> 07:43.760
it, I went down to the organizer. What do you want?

07:50.680 --> 07:52.700
Give me an opportunity to say no. So

07:52.680 --> 08:00.480
finally, what there'd be a big gripe was, there's a 
volunteer fire department, and they didn't have

07:52.680 --> 08:00.480
anybody to place the train on site. They'd open the 
damn fire key on Saturday morning. And that was

08:02.460 --> 08:04.790
their big gripe. You know, they worked five days a 
week, and they didn't have any place to come on in.

08:09.880 --> 08:10.901
It was too expensive. They didn't have any lights 
and so forth. What time do you want it? You want to

08:15.670 --> 08:17.690
open it at ten on Saturday? Burn it till six. They 
would kill that one. But another, at the same time,

08:22.000 --> 08:26.660
they were trying to get one out the rest of the time. 
And the word got to them then what we did. But then

08:28.640 --> 08:30.660
they used the excuse that we live too far away. We 
can't come that distance. Alright, can you give an

08:34.440 --> 08:38.460
example of where you needed some help in the 
legislature? You needed to get a bill passed, or

08:38.440 --> 08:43.460
some funding, and give me an example of where some 
people stepped up with the extension service. No,

08:48.690 --> 08:51.710
I'll request for state appropriated money. The 
only state appropriated money, the way I used my

08:51.690 --> 08:54.710
state appropriated money was for the volunteer 
fire departments and the growing million

08:54.690 --> 09:00.140
dollars. They didn't support our programs. I

09:03.100 --> 09:36.090
presented my bill,

09:03.100 --> 09:36.090
but I had programs

09:03.100 --> 09:36.090
that

09:03.100 --> 09:36.090
we had a $39 million. We didn't

09:36.070 --> 09:44.490
have any in-house fights with the board or other 
agencies. In fact, I had, on numerous occasions,

09:44.470 --> 09:49.340
extension service to get their money the way I got 
mine. And John Dutch said one time, the chancellor

09:51.320 --> 10:03.060
of the system, I guess he was about to answer that, 
by the way, he had them all, and his main complaint

10:05.040 --> 10:12.630
was he had a different clientele. You know, my 
comeback would tell me a poor group of volunteers.

10:19.300 --> 10:24.320
Alright, now, you reported to Benson and Calhoun 
under Dr. Williams when you were first. Alright,

10:27.300 --> 10:31.700
Dr. Williams has the heart attack, and then the 
system is recreated, the chancellor of the system

10:31.680 --> 10:37.700
recreated in 76, and Jarvis Miller becomes 
president. Now, Ludeke went in and served for

10:41.680 --> 10:44.700
Williams. Right, right. And tell them about 
working with General Ludeke. I

10:49.680 --> 10:58.060
said, yes, sir, and I knew it, but I didn't argue 
with him. How long did it take him to make up his mind

10:58.040 --> 11:02.060
about something? Well, when they told me I was 
going to move, that they were going to move the

11:05.200 --> 11:06.221
headquarters, my friend told me, now, this is 
temporary. And Dr. Williams told me, they've all

11:13.720 --> 11:17.200
agreed with me, that we have this eyesore for the 
university. Now, this is temporary. This is from

11:24.290 --> 11:26.310
that, down at the south. So, Ludeke was in 
community. When I went down there

11:28.920 --> 11:42.420
to see them, they had my reproduction shop. I 
always had an old reproduction shop. I admit, it

11:48.840 --> 11:49.861
was probably the oldest. Industrial economics, I 
had my own reproduction facility. So, I could

11:52.840 --> 11:54.920
control the time. I could move my projects around 
any way I wanted to. So, I had to deliver them. But I

11:59.280 --> 12:01.300
had a reproduction shop from day one. And a lot of 
people made it. Now, this was for printing? Yeah.

12:05.545 --> 12:06.300
Materials? Yes. All the artistic work. Yeah. 
Because all of mine was sponsored research. And,

12:11.360 --> 12:14.270
you know, when I brought down there, and I had Exxon 
on, I had contracts for Exxon for seven or eight

12:15.250 --> 12:18.270
straight years. And you made it to their board. 
Well, they expected a first class presentation.

12:23.250 --> 12:25.270
They didn't want to see some carbon paper stuck 
out. So, that was quality. And that was built into

12:28.360 --> 12:33.160
the price.

12:33.140 --> 12:35.160
But anyway, when I went down to see them, there was 
stuff coming up and down.

12:46.990 --> 12:51.010
Of course, I'd gone into really, you know, 
developing good lesson plans, good technical

12:50.990 --> 12:53.010
manuals. And, you know, we had part of a 
reproduction shop still do that. They built that

12:56.520 --> 12:57.541
building out. And, by the way, you know, we even 
paid for our building. We built that $250,000

13:00.800 --> 13:04.910
building out at Annex. We built that $500,000. 
Fred Benson and I put $500,000. He put $500,000

13:08.890 --> 13:10.910
into it. We built that bomb building. We built 
that. Hazardous materials. I built that out of my

13:15.816 --> 13:20.630
feed, you know. I asked them whether it was right or 
wrong. I operated the engine and extension

13:23.610 --> 13:25.630
service, and it was right or wrong. I charged for 
everything. There was no free things. I mean, it

13:31.390 --> 13:33.410
was all built into the price. So, we were able to do 
this kind of thing. But anyway, we got that

13:36.790 --> 13:38.810
September . I said, well, let's put it down on the 
first floor so people can get in and get out. And we

13:44.790 --> 13:46.930
moved that down. Well, I called. Who had that 
before? Who had that? Whoever had that chopper.

13:52.480 --> 13:54.500
People were going to do it. I said, you know, . Right 
from his office. Who was that guy that had that? I

14:01.480 --> 14:04.740
don't remember. All right. Then when

14:05.602 --> 14:22.660
General Ludeke

14:05.602 --> 14:22.660
steps aside, then

14:05.602 --> 14:22.660
let's see. Jarvis is president, and Dr. Williams 
is here for another couple of years. How did your

14:29.490 --> 14:33.510
reporting process change then? To whom did you 
report? Well, they made Pence the vice president.

14:56.480 --> 15:00.500
But now, you know, I'd give him a continuing 
education after five years. You know, I only took

15:00.480 --> 15:02.500
that job for five years. I was out of continuing 
education. And that fifth year came up just about

15:05.790 --> 15:11.400
the time Jarvis took over. All right. So, you then, 
by and large, reported to the system, not through

15:11.761 --> 15:20.930
the president's office? Well, I can't say that 
because I had to make him a budget presentation one

15:20.910 --> 15:25.270
year. Okay. All right. When he would have a staff 
meeting of his key people, did you meet with them?

15:30.250 --> 15:31.930
All right. Did... No, the agencies did. All right. 
Did Dr. Williams... Did he... When he gathered the

15:36.003 --> 15:39.740
agencies, you met with them when he was 
chancellor? Well, one or two meetings we had, yes.

15:44.280 --> 15:44.905
All right. Then when he left, Frank Hubert became 
the chancellor. What...

15:49.280 --> 15:54.860
Did the routine change at all? The first thing...

16:01.300 --> 16:08.210
He told me the first thing he liked about... I mean, 
Fred and Dean Hubert. All right. Then take me on up

16:15.247 --> 16:16.430
through the agencies. Take me on up through the 
80s. Were there any changes in the routine with

16:17.410 --> 16:24.320
different presidents and different 
chancellors? Well, of course, Richardson took

16:24.300 --> 16:26.730
over. Wait

16:26.710 --> 16:32.870
a minute. Wait. We skipped the man from Purdue. No, 
Hanson. Hanson. He was chancellor. Well, it was

16:38.830 --> 16:43.460
about 84 when...

16:43.440 --> 16:45.460
Oh, and Richardson became dean of engineering? 
Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah. Yeah. He became dean of

16:48.440 --> 16:51.020
engineering. All right. He was also... Describe 
his management style.

17:02.220 --> 17:03.267
Was it... He was less direct than Benson and 
Calhoun had been. Herb never... I can't say enough

17:10.883 --> 17:31.970
because

17:10.883 --> 17:31.970
Herb

17:10.883 --> 17:31.970
objected to a thing I wanted to do. He proved 
everything. I sat down and I met with him once a

17:33.450 --> 17:42.340
month where Herb's problems was caused by his dad, 
Jack Flipsey.

17:49.131 --> 17:51.040
And we only had one conflict. I believe in an 
organizational chart. I believe it. And I follow

17:55.040 --> 17:56.061
it. And I believe it. And I believe it. And I believe 
it. And I believe it. And I believe it. And I believe

18:02.400 --> 18:03.421
it. And I... But that's right. And I believe it. 
Understand? And God the creator of all things. Got

18:08.740 --> 18:09.345
it? We care about

18:09.365 --> 18:13.980
powerful people, that's enough. We're a little 
slow. But anyway.

18:18.545 --> 18:19.250
You want me to put this on tap? Maybe. Cut it off. Let 
me just talk a little. I'm not going to ask the

18:23.230 --> 18:28.250
negative, but in the positive, to which ones would 
you give the highest,

18:28.230 --> 18:36.500
as many as you want to, which ones deserve the 
highest credit. During

18:36.480 --> 18:41.750
that nineteen year period? Of course. I'd have to 
say Dr. E apply number one. But I just think he was

18:46.640 --> 18:52.000
more knowledgeable about the types of programs 
that the engineering detention service was in. I

18:51.980 --> 18:58.890
think that he accepted them on their merit, not his 
second class. He never did give me the feeling that

18:58.870 --> 19:01.890
we were second class to anybody, never to anybody 
else. He always was very easy to talk to. Who

19:09.380 --> 19:15.075
else? Well, of course, Mr. Benson. I'm taking him 
from the top down now. Mr. Benson and I had such a

19:20.750 --> 19:23.770
long-term relationship with each other. We were 
from about 55 to 54, whenever he became dean, until

19:23.750 --> 19:32.750
he got totally retired. We had a good relationship 
after he retired. Fred was always to the point,

19:37.590 --> 19:41.860
which I like. Fred had a lot of character, as I like. 
He'd always, if you were going to go out of town with

19:43.840 --> 19:48.980
him, you'd say you'd pick him up at 7.30. He'd stand 
around on the porch waiting for you at 7.30. He'd

19:53.430 --> 19:56.450
always ask you if you were going to go to a meeting 
where there would be a legislative meeting. Like,

19:56.430 --> 19:58.450
Jim, is there anything you want me to say? You know, 
he'd always ask me that question. Is there any area

20:00.430 --> 20:02.450
that you want me to comment on? And I always said, 
no. I

20:04.430 --> 20:09.450
think Fred was a very smart individual. He 
certainly commanded the attention of a lot of

20:09.430 --> 20:14.470
people. When he spoke, a lot of people listened. 
And I admired that in him. So I'd have to put him on

20:18.450 --> 20:23.470
the top, and then, of course, the next man would be 
Calhoun. And I always told him, well, I'll talk to

20:23.450 --> 20:25.780
Calhoun. He

20:25.760 --> 20:33.960
had a lot of important relationships together. In 
my opinion, I'm not saying one was better than the

20:33.940 --> 20:37.960
other, but in my opinion, we had a completely 
different type of leadership after the middle

20:37.940 --> 20:44.170
80s. It was completely different. Did it become 
more bureaucratic? Yes, it was strictly

20:50.240 --> 20:52.260
bureaucratic. You didn't feel at ease picking up 
the phone and calling. I never did it in the first

20:56.240 --> 20:58.260
place, but I always knew that I could if I wanted to 
talk to Dr. Calhoun. I didn't have to worry about

21:01.450 --> 21:04.470
Dr. Williams or Calhoun chewing me out for calling 
Dr. Williams or vice versa. Mr. Benson, I mean, I

21:06.450 --> 21:10.470
didn't ever do it, to my knowledge, but I always 
felt comfortable in doing such a thing like that.

21:14.450 --> 21:18.500
We were more, in my opinion, we were more 
professional. We respected each other more. We

21:20.720 --> 21:22.740
had a great deal of respect for each other. And I 
think that was probably the one ingredient that

21:22.720 --> 21:27.900
made those change in us, taking forward to the time 
I retired in 92. We

21:35.000 --> 21:39.020
had a closeness, I think. I felt to him as my friend. 
Not only as my boss, but my friend. Now, other than

21:46.030 --> 21:51.050
your senior partners, whom did you turn to for 
advice and counsel and input most often? To my

21:57.030 --> 21:58.051
committees. I had advisory committees in every 
sector of mine. Engineering Detention Service

22:01.030 --> 22:03.050
program. Made up of the leaders in their field. 
Like the telephone association, I'd have top

22:05.030 --> 22:09.050
telephone members. Power company, I'd have 
somebody from the power company. And we had

22:11.030 --> 22:14.020
advisory committees. We had one whole advisory 
committee for the Engineering Detention

22:14.000 --> 22:17.020
Service. We had one meeting a year. And I'd call it 
in various parts of the state. Other committee

22:21.600 --> 22:28.140
members was, you know, just pick up the phone and

22:21.600 --> 22:28.140
ask. I kept them informed. If it was on my telephone 
committee, you got it. And I didn't delude them

22:32.120 --> 22:33.141
with everything, but the things they ought to see, 
I sent it to them. That's who I got help from. My

22:37.400 --> 22:38.185
users. As you look back, can you think of any 
decisions you wish that Texas A&M had made that it

22:43.580 --> 22:46.600
didn't make?

22:59.440 --> 23:01.122
All right. Let's talk about that a minute. 
Co-education,

23:02.440 --> 23:07.460
higher admission requirements, racial 
integration, broadening the curriculum,

23:10.440 --> 23:12.292
non-compulsory core. All those came in the 60s. 
Did those affect your effort? No. You'd be

23:21.611 --> 23:27.520
surprised, I always traveled with an internship. 
And you'd be surprised at the number. I never took a

23:35.950 --> 23:50.600
trip that I

23:35.950 --> 23:50.600
didn't. The only one that's hurting it is people 
who don't. Now, you rode to Austin for a number of

23:53.300 --> 23:56.320
years to reserve meetings with Earl Rudder. Well, 
because I'd always assigned a driver out of my unit

24:00.770 --> 24:08.050
to drive for him. Oh. What that is because the last 
three that I assigned as a driver, they got them in

24:12.030 --> 24:14.050
West Point. Oh, I see. I see. But I only filled in 
there for a period of about. So, all right, during

24:19.810 --> 24:24.528
those years that you and Mr. Rudder were going to 
the same meeting then in Austin,

24:29.410 --> 24:48.980
describe your relationship with him and the 
reserve.

24:48.960 --> 24:50.980
For one time, I let myself down. He was

24:50.960 --> 25:02.120
going to his meeting on Monday night. You know, 
he'd have to be back. He'd be back by Monday. Mr.

25:07.829 --> 25:10.180
Rudder nominated me on the way back to Atlanta. He 
had the ability to do that. He said, well, what did

25:17.010 --> 25:19.030
y'all discuss? Well, we discussed the military 
part of it. We

25:23.180 --> 25:31.570
discussed military personnel part of it. The

25:31.550 --> 25:38.140
university, the only thing that would come up 
about the university, you know, he'd ask you some

25:38.120 --> 25:43.140
questions that you really had no answer. And you'd 
say, well, I don't think he ever asked this

25:43.120 --> 25:46.140
question. He just said, these are the type of 
questions he'd ask. Well, has making the Corps,

25:52.470 --> 25:56.120
the adoption of the persons coming to the 
university, has that had any effect on you? You

25:58.100 --> 26:00.430
know, I'd say, me personally? He'd say, well, 
personally, not a lot. I'd say, no. We're living in

26:03.410 --> 26:05.430
a different world. You know, I said, I wouldn't 
take all the money in the world for my years I spent

26:09.610 --> 26:12.630
in the Corps of Cadets. I said, but that was in 1940. 
And I said, I've got two sons. And I said, they're

26:16.210 --> 26:17.231
both in the Corps. But I guarantee you, I didn't 
push them into the Corps. They went there on their

26:19.210 --> 26:22.420
own. But we never did get into personalities. We 
never did with me. Because as I say, I was two ranks

26:25.400 --> 26:28.420
below him. I didn't have any relationship with him 
as him being my boss other than in the military. Can

26:33.400 --> 26:39.420
you share any anecdotes or amusing or interesting 
things that happened going to or from that

26:39.400 --> 26:43.420
involved Mr. Rutter? No, but did anything ever go 
wrong? Did you all ever have a flat or get there late

26:46.400 --> 26:49.420
or anything like that? Well, I got stopped several 
times for speeding. Oh, really? Oh, yeah. And what

26:53.400 --> 26:54.421
would the high- Fast draw. What did the highway 
patrol say? Give us a ticket. Oh, he gave you. It

26:58.400 --> 26:59.421
didn't matter whose car that was? We were driving a 
military vehicle. Mr. Rutter liked to get where he

27:00.400 --> 27:01.421
was going fast. No, I didn't know that. I don't know 
how many tickets he got. But with me, I got four. All

27:06.480 --> 27:07.439
right. Who paid the tickets? Okay. So you don't 
know. You don't know. Okay. I never did ask you.

27:13.960 --> 27:14.343
Did. He always would take the tickets. Did he ever 
ask you? No. Did he ever ask you? No. Did he ever ask

27:21.792 --> 27:25.500
you? No. Did he ever ask you?

27:30.480 --> 27:31.520
No. All right. He took the one ticket. All right. 
When the highway patrol would stop, did it impress

27:35.415 --> 27:38.620
the highway patrol that here was a major general? 
Well, that only happened one time with me. Oh.

27:41.192 --> 27:42.620
Okay. All right. So he didn't even talk to the 
person in the back seat. Okay. No. I'm just talking

27:47.600 --> 27:48.621
about one time. Yeah. Late at night. Mr. Rutter had 
a sense of humor? Can you give me any example of his?

27:52.940 --> 27:53.961
I'll tell you. I had an infantry battle. I picked 
out a uniform. I had a uniform. I had a uniform. I had

28:00.960 --> 28:01.981
a uniform. I had a uniform.

28:39.240 --> 28:42.140
I had a uniform. We had a nice rural crew. We come 
right to. . . Only the other general drove up. I went

28:47.080 --> 28:50.870
up to this gentleman and said, now there's a lot of 
wood rattlers here. And I said,

28:50.850 --> 29:09.590
in fact, I said,

28:50.850 --> 29:09.590
there's

28:50.850 --> 29:09.590
one right by your foot. That's what I said. He's a 
little bit sharp there. They put your boots on, and

29:12.750 --> 29:16.070
they moved on. But anyway. We went up to this thing. 
By that time, boy, everything was going well. I

29:20.050 --> 29:21.071
mean, I had that dem. Always had the time, right 
from— Da. Da. Da dom. There was an awful little tank

29:24.723 --> 29:26.070
in front of me. So, Mr. Weller asked me to go off the 
dock, but anyway, I told this gentleman, I said,

29:26.050 --> 29:37.110
sir, I said, there's another rattlesnake that 
crashed by your foot, and I just put my foot back out

29:26.050 --> 29:37.110
and stopped that. He said, didn't bite me, did he? 
So I got into his car, he said, now, are you sure that

29:40.650 --> 29:43.310
rattlesnake didn't bite you? I said, I'll say it 
didn't bite you. Mr. Weller said, Jim, I said, I'd

29:44.740 --> 29:48.040
like to see you at 1 o'clock today at 4 o'clock. And I 
thought he was going to get me for telling him about

29:49.920 --> 29:52.200
the damn rattlesnake. He said, what, damn it, 
Carl? He said, when I said, made it realistic, he

29:56.010 --> 30:00.490
said, I didn't want you to run over us.

30:03.970 --> 30:09.110
I said, well, I said, at that slope, I said, you 
know, I said, to make it realistic, we had to come

30:03.970 --> 30:09.110
take part of that slope. He said, I didn't want that 
damn rattlesnake. As far as you know, when Earl

30:12.470 --> 30:21.720
Rudder was president of A&M, to whom did he turn for 
advice most often? Whose advice did he listen to

30:21.700 --> 30:25.180
most carefully?

30:29.420 --> 30:30.441
Mr. You said in-house? Mr.

30:30.420 --> 30:40.997
Mm-hmm. Mr. All right. Then you? Mr. It might 
surprise you, though, if you didn't know. Mr. You

30:44.980 --> 30:46.001
said in-house. All right. Let's go out of the 
house. Mr. Well, he had ear to the board's advice.

30:49.980 --> 30:51.001
He had a lot of respect for the board. Oh, in 70. Mr. 
In 69. Mr. Sterling Evans, Zachary, Clyde Wells.

30:56.930 --> 30:57.951
Clyde Wells was on it, and Mrs. Wilson was on it. All 
right. That's all we got for this webinar today.

31:06.070 --> 31:07.091
Thanks for your time, everyone. Okay. Thank

31:11.021 --> 31:16.260
you. Bye. Good night. Mr. Thank you, everybody. 
Mr. Good night. All right. Good morning. Good

31:22.610 --> 31:24.345
morning. Good morning. Good morning. Mr. Good 
evening. Good morning. Good morning. Oh, you're

31:28.610 --> 31:29.631
good. Good morning. Mrs. Good morning, everyone. 
Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. All

31:35.349 --> 31:35.639
right.
