WEBVTT

00:02.107 --> 00:05.231
Full-time center managers. And they had their 
respective areas that they were out constantly

00:05.251 --> 00:09.818
seeing what we could do. Need study. Learn need 
study. And then the divisions, so we wouldn't have

00:11.760 --> 00:16.467
any conflict with the divisions, they signed 
their staff to that center. And those staff that

00:17.068 --> 00:20.693
reported to their head of the division didn't 
report to the city manager. The center manager had

00:20.713 --> 00:23.797
no administrative control over any of the people. 
All his was from facilities, providing need

00:23.817 --> 00:31.067
studies, making sure the door was open when they 
spoke to me and so forth and so on. And that was

00:31.739 --> 00:35.585
probably the greatest thing we did during my 
tenure. We created those centers. We were much

00:38.970 --> 00:42.676
more cost-effective in delivering our services. 
We had availability of lots of good professional

00:42.836 --> 00:46.702
help. You know, you might just need a lawyer for a 
two-hour presentation to take to an accident

00:47.584 --> 00:54.034
investigation or whatever. And we had those 
available, of course, in these centers because

00:54.054 --> 00:58.381
it's all located in major areas. And that was 
probably one of the the best decisions that I made

01:00.157 --> 01:02.880
there at that time. Not only for the engineering 
convention center, but for the entire university

01:03.000 --> 01:07.165
system. Because we give them another 
organization represented in this grand system.

01:14.052 --> 01:15.934
And they were always first class operations. 
There was no piggyback. They were always first

01:19.057 --> 01:22.561
class. When we started to offer the rig training, 
all-field rig training, and see the independent

01:24.811 --> 01:35.369
drillers come to me and say, look, we've got, this 
is about 12, 15 years ago, back in the early 80s, we

01:24.811 --> 01:35.369
need some trained rig workers. So I said, well, 
here's what we're going to take. And I said, we have

01:39.797 --> 01:41.860
to have a rig. We have to have this. And the 
independent drillers said they can give us the rig

01:43.062 --> 01:47.169
to train on. They give us the, they underwrote the 
program, which was rather expensive. Billy Mac's

01:52.140 --> 01:56.268
kid went through it, his son went through it, and 
said it's the greatest train he ever had in his

01:52.140 --> 01:56.268
life. But we believed no hands on the train. We 
believed in theory, but we believed no hands on the

02:00.717 --> 02:04.465
train. And so that was a great success. It got us a 
lot of publicity with the legislature. Bill

02:09.395 --> 02:11.339
Clements came out. He was governor. Looking

02:14.339 --> 02:35.014
back on those 19 years, Is there any area of 
service, and I don't mean geographic area, but any

02:35.855 --> 02:52.785
topic that you wish you all could have done more?

02:53.286 --> 02:56.952
Were you frustrated that you couldn't have served 
this or this or this industry? We couldn't serve

02:58.028 --> 02:59.530
them. We had no boundaries. See, the Engineering 
Extension Service is the only agency in the state

03:01.532 --> 03:09.540
of Texas that has a statewide mandate to provide 
probation and technical training on an extension

03:01.532 --> 03:09.540
basis. We had no condominium. We saw something 
like you mentioned. Yeah, we saw it, but we got on

03:12.443 --> 03:13.684
it. We jumped on it right away. And normally, in all 
those cases, there's some agency, some trade

03:15.225 --> 03:25.316
association, some technically role in it as far as 
the money raising is concerned. What were your

03:25.596 --> 03:27.698
favorite groups to work with? There must have been 
some that were more pleasant than others though.

03:39.025 --> 03:54.460
Who

03:39.025 --> 03:54.460
were the key state officials that you worked with?

03:56.462 --> 03:58.824
Don't you name your favorites. The ones that you 
would say thank you to I guess the one that

04:00.533 --> 04:29.393
probably was my favorite and I don't know why I say I 
don't know but anyway I like Mark White Mark White

04:00.533 --> 04:29.393
and I and Joe Reynolds see Joe Reynolds Reynolds 
and White was in the law practice together and

04:00.533 --> 04:29.393
White was his junior member and then when he made 
Secretary of State because I knew White when he was

04:00.533 --> 04:29.393
on the with the as in his law firm. And Mark White, 
the Secretary of State, come on up and run for

04:33.099 --> 04:40.688
governor. I felt that he was the only governor I 
really, really knew. You know, for any, I mean,

04:44.833 --> 04:54.705
I've known all the governors, but I mean, to really 
know them, so I guess that's one reason

04:44.833 --> 04:54.705
I felt it was close to him.

04:57.875 --> 05:00.077
Of course, Bill Preston helped me out an awful lot. 
Any time I wanted an appointment with any senator

05:00.758 --> 05:04.281
or representative, I could call Bill. He'd hand me 
an appointment. This was while he was? State

05:07.364 --> 05:08.805
chairman. Well, while he was a representative, 
and as he served, you know, he served as chairman of

05:08.845 --> 05:16.873
the House Appropriation Committee for about 10 or 
12 years. Whenever I wanted an appointment with

05:16.973 --> 05:21.997
any senator or house representative, I'd call 
Bill. He'd hand me an appointment. Of course, Bill

05:24.840 --> 05:25.941
Moore. when he was in the Senate. I had done a lot of 
other work for Bill Moore. And on his outside, we

05:32.767 --> 05:34.970
had that back of A&M. I wrote the chart for that back 
of A&M with Bill and . Can you give me an example of

05:41.516 --> 05:49.825
lobbying at work, where you called somebody and 
they made the wheels turn? Describe. for a

05:54.355 --> 05:55.957
specific project? If there was one, you can think 
of? Yeah. I can think of one for fire. There was a big

06:05.568 --> 06:12.976
push to create two or three more fire fields in the 
state of Texas. And they didn't want to be a part of

06:14.438 --> 06:17.181
A&M. They wanted to create their own, take a bunch 
of volunteer fire departments. They thought they

06:20.525 --> 06:22.607
should have their own fire field. There was no way 
in the world it could ever support the town. But

06:25.714 --> 06:31.920
still, the volunteer fire departments carry a lot 
of rank in rural areas with their elected

06:25.714 --> 06:31.920
representatives. And so they put on a push to 
create a fire field somewhere out in Woodlands

06:31.940 --> 06:37.084
area. This was long before the Woodlands was 
built. And they bypassed us completely. And I got a

06:44.651 --> 06:49.075
call one day from a member of the representative's 
name down in that area. He said, what did I think

06:49.155 --> 06:52.898
about you? It was Brazoria County that was pushing 
it so hard. I think it was Brazoria County that was

06:58.152 --> 07:03.878
pushing it so hard that it was going to tie in with 
Harris County. I said, well, it's a very expensive

07:03.898 --> 07:07.642
train program. I said, it's not cheap. I said, 
you've got to have good training. You've got to be

07:11.366 --> 07:13.227
damn careful. And I said, fuel's expensive, and 
you've got to burn. You can't just light a match and

07:16.050 --> 07:19.534
say, here, now we're going to go put it out. I said, 
if you're going to have any fire training or those

07:19.554 --> 07:24.319
types of training, you've got to have hands-on 
training. They got to smell the heat and feel the

07:24.670 --> 07:26.212
heat. But anyway, so he said, well, they're 
putting this consortium together now. I know that

07:32.460 --> 07:37.086
they're going to be coming to this for 
appropriation.

07:37.106 --> 07:41.451
So we got that started. Now, the way I stopped it, I 
went down to the organizer. I said, tell me, what do

07:44.695 --> 07:48.620
you guys want? What do you want? Tell me what you 
want. Give me an opportunity to say no. So finally,

07:54.910 --> 08:01.039
what their big gripe was, is volunteer fire 
department, they didn't have anybody to place the

07:54.910 --> 08:01.039
train on Saturday. They opened the damn parking on 
Saturday morning. And that was their big gripe.

08:05.124 --> 08:09.230
You know, they worked five days a week, and they 
didn't have anybody to place the... I don't know,

08:09.250 --> 08:11.934
it was too expensive to spend the night and so 
forth. So I said, yeah, that's a problem. What time

08:14.037 --> 08:14.978
do you want it? You want it to open at 10 on Saturday? 
Burn it till 6. But we killed that one. But another,

08:21.303 --> 08:26.228
at the same time, they were trying to get one out in 
West Texas. And the word got to them then what we

08:26.248 --> 08:27.949
did. But then they used the excuse that we live too 
far away. We can't come that distance.

08:34.415 --> 08:38.419
All right, can you give an example of where you 
needed some help in the legislature? You needed to

08:38.799 --> 08:48.748
get a bill passed or some funding and give an 
example of where some people stepped up and helped

08:38.799 --> 08:48.748
the extension service. No, I'll request one. The 
only state appropriated money, the only state

08:51.239 --> 08:57.911
appropriated money, the way I used my state 
appropriated money was from the volunteer fire

08:51.239 --> 08:57.911
departments in the rural water district. See, the 
rest of this is $3 million. They didn't support our

09:02.158 --> 09:07.347
programs like PILAR and the great television. No, 
we never,

09:07.367 --> 09:16.403
I don't ever, I didn't, I presented my, I worked 
with LBP. I had the LVB over two months before

09:17.648 --> 09:23.456
anybody else did, and I was taking them through 
what my request was going to be. But I had programs

09:23.476 --> 09:27.301
that the legislature couldn't fuss about. 
Volunteer Fire Department, you know, rural water

09:27.421 --> 09:30.886
districts. They couldn't fuss if there was a 
problem. And it was, you know, even though we had a

09:33.990 --> 09:41.721
$39 million budget, it was only costing the state 
$3

09:33.990 --> 09:41.721
million. And we didn't even have any in-house 
fights with the board or other agencies. In fact, I

09:45.566 --> 09:46.187
had on numerous occasions challenged that 
detention service to get their money the way I got

09:46.589 --> 09:52.014
mine. And John Dutch said one time that Bill Moore 
and I don't know, four or five others, along with at

09:52.575 --> 10:05.006
that time, I don't know who was the chancellor of 
the system, I guess he was about to answer that. But

10:05.026 --> 10:06.047
anyway, he had them all. And his main complaint was 
that he couldn't compete with us. He had a

10:12.893 --> 10:14.655
different clientele. All

10:14.973 --> 10:26.831
right, now you reported to Benson and Calhoun 
under Dr. Williams when you were first. All right.

10:28.334 --> 10:35.445
Dr. Williams has the heart attack, and then the 
system is recreated. The chancellor of the system

10:35.565 --> 10:39.411
recreated in 76. And Jarvis Miller becomes 
president. Ludeke went in and served for

10:42.374 --> 10:45.117
Williams. Right. And tell them about working with 
General Ludeke. No problem. He and I, he was a

10:52.587 --> 10:56.572
general and I was a colonel, so I had to say yes, sir, 
and I knew it. I didn't argue with him. How long did

10:59.015 --> 11:02.699
it take him to make up his mind about something? 
Well, when they told me I was going to move, that

11:02.719 --> 11:08.807
they were going to move the headquarters over to 
Henderson Hall, And at that time Fred told me, now

11:09.310 --> 11:14.055
this is temporary. And Dr. Wheaton told me this is 
temporary. But they've all agreed with me that we

11:16.657 --> 11:19.460
had to get out of there. It was that. It was eyesore 
for the university. And that's the approach I

11:22.083 --> 11:22.743
took. It's not for me, it's, you know. Now this is 
from that, down at the south. We missed this all,

11:26.147 --> 11:28.209
yeah. So Ludeke was in command when they were going 
to let the contract for Henderson Hall be fixed up.

11:39.432 --> 11:45.380
When I went down there to see the plants, they had my 
reproduction shop up on the third floor. And I

11:45.400 --> 11:47.323
always had my own reproduction facility. You may 
say that's your home. I admit it was probably your

11:49.045 --> 11:50.307
home. But in industrial economics, I had my own 
reproduction facility. So I could control the

11:53.531 --> 11:56.355
time. I could move my projects around any way I 
wanted to. So I had to deliver them. But I had a

11:59.099 --> 12:01.082
reproduction shop from day one. And a lot of people 
managed. Now, this was for printing materials?

12:06.289 --> 12:07.010
Yes. All my artistic work. Because all mine was 
sponsored research. And, you know, when I brought

12:12.740 --> 12:18.388
down, and I had Exxon, I had contracts for Exxon for 
seven or eight straight years. And you made it to

12:19.510 --> 12:20.792
their board. Well, they expected a first class 
presentation. They didn't want to see some carbon

12:23.035 --> 12:25.679
paper stuck out of it. So I mean, I had, that was 
quality. And that was built into the price to

12:28.623 --> 12:31.287
operate that thing. That was built into the price. 
But anyway, when I went down to see him, General

12:33.150 --> 12:37.857
Luther was in charge at that time. I said, you know, 
we can't have that facility up on the third floor. I

12:42.277 --> 12:44.219
said, well, I've only got one little bitty 
elevator. And I said, there'll be stuff coming up

12:44.579 --> 12:46.962
and down. And of course, I'd gone into really 
developing good lesson plans, good technical

12:46.982 --> 12:52.247
manuals. And we had part of a reproduction shop 
still do that. And they built that building out.

12:58.033 --> 13:01.196
And by the way, we even paid for our building. We 
built that $250,000 building out We built the

13:03.672 --> 13:05.334
annex. We built that $500,000. Fred Benson put 
$500,000. He put $500,000 out of the engine

13:08.537 --> 13:11.360
extension. We built that bomb building. We built 
that. It has its materials. I built that out of my

13:15.584 --> 13:20.489
feed.

13:21.310 --> 13:22.671
I ask them whether it's right or wrong. I operated 
the engine extension services. I charged for

13:26.595 --> 13:29.318
everything. There was no free things. I mean, it 
was all built into the price. And so we were able to

13:33.963 --> 13:36.787
do these kind of things. But anyway, we got that to 
General Lukey's locale. I said, well, let's put it

13:40.592 --> 13:46.120
down on the first floor so people can get in and get 
out. And we moved that down. Well, I called, who had

13:46.881 --> 13:50.807
that before? Whoever had that chopper, he wanted 
to do it. And General Lukey, out on the phone, said,

13:54.792 --> 13:58.938
right from his office. Who was that guy that had 
that before? I don't remember. All right. Then

14:05.604 --> 14:22.799
when

14:05.604 --> 14:22.799
General Ludeke

14:05.604 --> 14:22.799
steps aside, then Frank, let's see. No, that's 
when Jarvis comes in. Jarvis is president, and Dr.

14:24.620 --> 14:29.344
Williams is here for another couple of years. How 
did your reporting process change then? To whom

14:34.139 --> 14:35.321
did you report?

14:38.185 --> 14:43.252
Well, they made Pinson vice president of 
engineering, so I still reported up to him for

14:38.185 --> 14:43.252
that. Okay. They didn't have, I guess I reported 
directly to Jarvis for continuing education,

14:45.575 --> 14:50.822
because I know I never did go up through Prescott. 
Okay. To my knowledge, I didn't. But now you know

14:56.590 --> 15:00.115
I'd give them a continuing education after five 
years. You know, I only took that job for five

15:00.135 --> 15:02.038
years. So after five years, I'll about continuing 
education. And that fifth year came up just about

15:06.471 --> 15:09.534
the time Jarvis took over. OK. All right. So you 
then, by and large, reported to the system, not

15:11.456 --> 15:19.604
through the president's office. Well, I can't say 
that, because I had to make my budget presentation

15:20.685 --> 15:24.969
one year to Jarvis. OK. All right. When he would 
have a staff meeting of his key people, did you meet

15:25.990 --> 15:30.235
with them? All right. No, the agency did. All 
right, did Dr. Williams, did he, when he gathered

15:33.590 --> 15:41.999
the agencies, you met with them when he was 
chancellor?

15:42.019 --> 15:44.002
Well, one or two meetings we had, yes. All right. 
All right, then when he left, Frank Hubert became

15:44.642 --> 15:48.066
the chancellor.

15:51.971 --> 15:54.513
What, did the routine change at all? It never 
changed. Okay. See, he was a Fred Benson man. You

15:58.498 --> 16:00.020
knew that, Frank Hubert. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. The 
first thing he told me, the first thing he did when

16:00.826 --> 16:07.674
he became chancellor, was for his friend Vincent 
Sellard to attend Pat's office. See, he liked

16:07.694 --> 16:08.615
Fred. I mean, Fred and Dean. I think they were 
family friends, too. All right, then take me on up

16:14.923 --> 16:17.726
through the 80s. Were there any changes in the 
routine with different presidents and different

16:17.806 --> 16:24.254
chancellors? Well, of course, Richardson took 
over

16:25.396 --> 16:30.782
in 84. All right, no matter. Wait, we skipped the 
man from Purdue. No, Hanson. Hanson. He was

16:36.614 --> 16:38.957
chancellor. Well, it was about 84 when he did it.

16:43.402 --> 16:45.784
Oh, and Richardson became dean of engineering. 
Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah, yeah. He became dean of

16:48.227 --> 16:50.670
engineering. All right. And he was also vice 
chancellor. Describe his management style.

17:01.542 --> 17:08.150
Was it, it was less direct than Benson and Calhoun 
had been? Herb never, the whole time that he was

17:08.230 --> 17:17.943
there, Herb never put a crossword. Herb and I got 
along superbly.

17:24.138 --> 17:27.482
I can't say enough good things about her, which is 
where I come from. She never objected to a thing I

17:27.502 --> 17:29.544
wanted to do. She proved everything I sent down to 
her. I met with him once a month.

17:36.912 --> 17:38.954
And it was no problem. Where her problems was 
caused by his dad, Jack Flipsey, Kim, what was his

17:38.974 --> 17:49.526
name? Kim Hall. And we only had one conflict. Now, 
you've got to realize I'm a very organized person.

18:00.151 --> 18:02.354
I believe in an organizational chart. I believe 
it, and I follow it. But anyway, you want me to put

18:04.458 --> 18:08.525
this on tape? Cut it off. Let me just talk to you.

18:14.274 --> 18:20.284
As you look back,

18:14.274 --> 18:20.284
you served 19 years. under a number of different 
presidents and chancellors. I'm not going to ask

18:23.822 --> 18:28.948
the negative, but in the positive, to which ones 
would you give the highest?

18:33.273 --> 18:34.234
As many as you want to. Which ones deserve the 
highest credit? During that 19-year

18:36.517 --> 18:40.842
period? Of course, I'd have to say Dr. Liggins in 
place number one. Why? But I just think he is more

18:46.960 --> 18:53.466
knowledgeable about the types of programs that 
the Engineering Detention Services have. I think

18:54.367 --> 18:58.690
that he accepted them on their merit, not as second 
class. He never did give me the feeling that we were

18:58.911 --> 19:03.395
second class to anybody, or to anybody else. He 
always was fair. He was very easy to talk to.

19:14.605 --> 19:15.145
Who else? Well, of course, Mr. Benson, I'm taking 
him from the top down now. Mr. Benson and I had such a

19:19.944 --> 19:25.170
long-term relationship with each other. We had it 
from about 55 to 54, whenever he became, until he

19:25.350 --> 19:32.738
got totally retired. We had a good relationship 
after he retired. Fred was always to the point,

19:37.624 --> 19:41.007
which I like. Fred had a lot of character, you know. 
He always... I think Fred

19:45.567 --> 20:08.903
was a very smart

19:45.567 --> 20:08.903
individual.

20:10.325 --> 20:12.148
He certainly commanded the the attention of a lot 
of people. When he spoke, a lot of people listened.

20:17.001 --> 20:18.983
And I admired that in him. So I'd have to put him on 
the top, and then of course the next man was

20:19.003 --> 20:26.330
Calhoun. So I went out and talked to Calhoun. We had 
a lot of working relationships together. But in my

20:32.295 --> 20:40.903
opinion, I'm not saying one was better than the 
other, but in my opinion, we had completely

20:32.295 --> 20:40.903
different types of leadership. After the middle 
80s, it was completely different. Did it become

20:47.230 --> 20:48.972
more bureaucratic? Yes, it was strictly 
bureaucratic. You didn't feel at ease picking up

20:51.996 --> 20:56.001
the phone and calling. I never did it in the first 
place, but I always knew that I could if I wanted to

20:56.803 --> 21:01.709
talk to Dr. Williams or Calhoun. I didn't have to 
worry about Dr. Williams or Calhoun chewing me out

21:01.729 --> 21:06.756
for calling Dr. Williams or vice versa. Mr. 
Benson, I didn't ever do it. to my knowledge, but I

21:10.600 --> 21:14.884
always felt comfortable in doing such a thing like 
that. We were more, in my opinion, we were more

21:14.904 --> 21:18.508
professional. We respected each other more. We 
had a great deal of respect for each other. And I

21:22.693 --> 21:28.178
think that was probably the one ingredient that 
made those change. And I think before the time I

21:28.238 --> 21:37.688
retired in 92,

21:37.853 --> 21:39.315
We had a closeness. I felt to him as my friend, and 
not only as my boss, but my friend. Other than your

21:47.164 --> 21:56.775
senior partners, whom did you turn to for advice 
and counsel and input most often? To my

21:57.076 --> 21:57.776
committees. I had advisory committees in every 
sector of my Engineering Detention Service

21:58.457 --> 22:05.025
program, made up of the leaders in their field. 
Like a telephone association, I'd have top

22:05.427 --> 22:09.070
telephone members. Power company, I'd have 
somebody from the power company. And we had

22:11.833 --> 22:14.035
advisory committees. We had one whole law 
advisory committee for the engineering

22:14.055 --> 22:16.617
attention. It had one meeting a year. And I'd call 
it in various parts of the state. Other committee

22:21.962 --> 22:25.065
members would just pick up the phone and ask. And I 
kept them informed. If it was on my telephone

22:29.869 --> 22:32.111
committee, you got it. And I didn't delude them 
with everything, but the things they ought to see,

22:32.191 --> 22:34.573
I sent it to them. That's who I got help from, my 
users. As you look back, can you think of any

22:38.788 --> 22:46.456
decisions you wish that Texas A&M had made that it 
didn't make?

22:49.859 --> 22:56.165
Well, I think they should have gone forward and 
carried the intent of 15 years before we did. I

22:56.185 --> 22:59.809
can't say that because I don't have the 
background. All right. Let's talk about that a

23:01.150 --> 23:02.572
minute. Coeducation. higher admission 
requirements, racial integration, broadening

23:04.810 --> 23:15.701
the curriculum, non-compulsory core, all those 
came in the 60s.

23:17.023 --> 23:19.485
Did those affect your effort? No. No, they helped 
my effort. You'd be surprised as to how many

23:23.690 --> 23:28.835
people, you know, I always traveled with an 
internship card. That was my Roman billboard. And

23:31.523 --> 23:36.229
you'd be surprised at the number of people that 
stopped me and asked me questions or to give them

23:31.523 --> 23:36.229
information. I never took a trip that I didn't come 
back to and I didn't have four or five requests for

23:36.249 --> 23:40.655
information. And, uh, questions just like you 
had, you know. This girl was effective, you know.

23:46.624 --> 23:47.645
And I'm not the one that's been effective. 
Everybody helps. The only one that's hurting it is

23:50.028 --> 23:52.972
people who don't want to join the program. Now, you 
rode to Austin for a number of years to reserve

23:53.653 --> 24:00.923
meetings with Earl Rudder. With Earl, I only went 
over there about six months with him because I'd

24:01.527 --> 24:08.434
always assigned a driver out of my unit to drive for 
him. And when I quit that, it's because the last

24:08.595 --> 24:13.700
three that I assigned as a driver, they got them in 
Westport. Oh, I see. I see. But I only filled in

24:15.062 --> 24:19.807
there for a period of about six months, I guess. So, 
all right, during those years that you and Mr.

24:24.552 --> 24:31.399
Rudder were going to the same meeting then in 
Austin,

24:24.552 --> 24:31.399
describe your relationship with him. in reserve 
well of course mr rudder was a major general and i

24:32.088 --> 24:57.707
was a colonel and so rank-wise we was miles apart 
and i respected that i always addressed john

24:32.088 --> 24:57.707
rudder i never one time let myself down around 
children i always was reasonably formal we never

24:32.088 --> 24:57.707
did What he did was, he was going to his meeting on 
Monday night, and you know, he'd have to be back.

25:04.582 --> 25:07.044
He'd be back by 11.30, 12 o'clock. Mr. Rutter, Mr. 
Rutter, nominally on the way back, slept. And he

25:11.909 --> 25:14.571
had the ability to go to sleep.

25:17.193 --> 25:18.615
He said, well, what did y'all discuss?

25:21.557 --> 25:24.540
Well, we discussed the military quarter. 
Discussed my unit. I had a battle group. We

25:29.176 --> 25:35.485
discussed military personnel quite a bit.

25:35.505 --> 25:46.902
The university, the only thing that would come up 
about the university, you know, he'd ask you some

25:35.505 --> 25:46.902
questions that you really had no answer, and you'd 
say, well, let's just say I don't think he ever

25:35.505 --> 25:46.902
asked this question. You're just thinking these 
are the type of questions he'd ask. Well, has

25:50.747 --> 25:58.238
making the Corps adoptive of the persons coming to 
the university, that had any effect on you? You

25:58.741 --> 26:00.804
know, I'd say, me, Perkins? He'd say, well, 
Perkins and I do well. I'd say, no, we're living in a

26:02.927 --> 26:05.390
different world.

26:08.475 --> 26:12.601
And, you know, I said, I wouldn't take all the money 
in the world for my years I spent in the Corps for

26:08.475 --> 26:12.601
this. I said, but, I said, that was in 1940. And I 
said, I've got two sons. And I said, they're both in

26:17.027 --> 26:19.731
the Corps, but I guarantee you I didn't push them in 
the Corps. They went there on their own. But we

26:23.035 --> 26:24.958
never did get into personalities. We never did 
with me because, as I say, I was two ranks below him.

26:28.390 --> 26:34.337
I didn't have any relationship with him as him 
being my boss other than in the military. Can you

26:34.638 --> 26:43.329
share any anecdotes or amusing or interesting 
things that happened going to or from that

26:34.638 --> 26:43.329
involved Mr. Rutter? No, but did anything ever go 
wrong? Did you all ever have a flat or get there late

26:46.393 --> 26:49.356
or anything like that? Well, I got stopped several 
times for speeding. Oh, really? Oh, yeah. And what

26:53.502 --> 26:56.305
would the highway patrol say? Oh, he gave you, it 
didn't matter whose car that was? We were driving a

27:02.012 --> 27:03.533
military vehicle. Mr. Runner liked to get where he 
was going fast. I don't know if anybody's ever told

27:06.536 --> 27:08.539
you that before. No, I didn't know that. He wasn't 
allergic to pushing the metal to the pedal. I don't

27:15.806 --> 27:20.491
know how many tickets he got, but with me, I got one. 
All right, who paid the tickets? I gave it to him.

27:25.417 --> 27:26.578
Okay, so you don't know. You don't know, OK. I never 
did ask him. He always would take the ticket from

27:29.749 --> 27:31.431
me. He took the one ticket from me. All right, when 
the highway patrol would stop, did it impress the

27:32.392 --> 27:39.339
highway patrol that here was a major general? 
Well, that only happened one time with me. And I

27:41.862 --> 27:44.124
doubt if that highway patrol knew a major general. 
All right, so he didn't even talk to the person in

27:44.144 --> 27:48.049
the back seat. OK. No, I'm just talking about one 
time. It was late at night. Mr. Rudder, have a sense

27:52.974 --> 27:53.935
of humor? Very good sense of humor. uh give me any 
can you give me an example of his i told you i had an

27:57.052 --> 28:25.877
infantry battle group and we always had the army 
commander come down when we go to camp so mr rudder

27:57.052 --> 28:25.877
always used my battle group as one to demonstrate 
him put on there today so one day we had this general

27:57.052 --> 28:25.877
come down fourth army commander you know i said to 
him i want to do this we'll be out of here training at

27:57.052 --> 28:25.877
11 o'clock give me a map to tell me specifically 
where you're going to be all of these So I said,

28:26.735 --> 28:31.700
fine, I've done this a dozen times. So we decided to 
have an interview in a tank. And I picked out a

28:38.547 --> 28:44.293
beautiful valley, and I had a nice row of trees. And 
we come right, so I said, OK, we're going to come

28:44.313 --> 28:50.640
right down and do our tanks. And so Bowman, Mr. 
Runner, and the other general go up. I went up and

28:53.162 --> 28:55.645
reported to him. Oh, he said, oh. And I said to this 
gentleman, I said, now there's a lot of wood

28:58.698 --> 29:04.746
rattlers here up that wall. And I said, in fact, I 
said, there's one right by your foot. Oh, he's a

29:10.954 --> 29:13.678
little bit shorter than me. And I said, put your 
boots on. They won't bother you. But anyway, we

29:16.982 --> 29:18.043
went up to this thing. By that time, boy, 
everything was going to be different. I mean, I had

29:20.166 --> 29:20.927
the idea. I've always had the time right there. 
They'd have a little awful time for attacking you.

29:27.670 --> 29:28.992
So Mr. . But anyway, I told this gentleman, I said, 
sir, I said, there's another rattlesnake that

29:29.012 --> 29:38.863
crashed by your foot, and I just put my foot back out 
and stopped it. He said, get it back. I said, no,

29:39.484 --> 29:40.245
sir, get it back. So I got into his car. He said, now, 
are you sure that rattlesnake didn't crash? I

29:44.530 --> 29:45.191
said, I'll show you. He said, I'd like to see you at 1 
o'clock today, Carl. And I thought he was going to

29:50.237 --> 29:52.419
get me for telling him about the damn rattlesnake. 
He said, goddammit, Carl. He said, when I said,

29:56.729 --> 30:04.277
make it realistic, he said, I didn't want you to run 
over

29:56.729 --> 30:04.277
us. I said, well, I said, at that slope, I said, you 
know, I said, to make it realistic, we had to come

30:04.297 --> 30:09.922
take part in that slope. He said, I didn't want it 
that damn close. As far as you know, when Earl

30:12.765 --> 30:22.335
Rudder was president of A&M, to whom did he turn for 
advice most often? Whose advice did he listen to

30:22.795 --> 30:25.318
most carefully? Well, do you mean from in-house?

30:34.029 --> 30:40.456
Mm-hmm.

30:40.476 --> 30:40.736
I don't know. All right, then you. It might 
surprise you, though, if you didn't know. There

30:44.139 --> 30:46.322
might be some instructor down there or something. 
You said in-house. All right, let's go out of the

30:47.223 --> 30:48.444
house. Away from the campus, whose advice did he 
hear? Well, he had here to the board's advice. He

30:54.661 --> 30:56.082
had a lot of respect for the board. Which, who were 
the key board members during his day? Well, let's

31:00.327 --> 31:02.108
see. He got out, when did he die, in 59? Oh, in 70. In 
69? Okay. He died in March of 77.

31:14.841 --> 31:19.185
Sterling Evans, Zachary, Clyde Wells. Clyde 
Wells was on it, and Mrs. Wilson from Lubbock was on

31:19.245 --> 31:23.149
it. And I don't know whether Norman Mosier was on it 
at that time. I don't either. And I don't know

31:30.416 --> 31:31.941
whether Mr.
