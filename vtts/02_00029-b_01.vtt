WEBVTT

00:02.090 --> 00:05.214
Full-time center managers.

00:05.234 --> 00:08.919
And they had their respective areas that they were out constantly seeing what we could do.

00:08.939 --> 00:09.620
Need study.

00:09.640 --> 00:11.703
Learn need study conference.

00:11.723 --> 00:17.011
And then the divisions, so we wouldn't have any conflict with divisions, they signed their staff to that center.

00:17.031 --> 00:19.534
And those staff didn't report it to their head of the division.

00:19.554 --> 00:20.676
Didn't report to the city manager.

00:20.696 --> 00:23.960
The center manager had no administrative control over any of the people.

00:23.980 --> 00:26.063
All his was from facilities.

00:26.083 --> 00:27.806
Provided need studies.

00:27.826 --> 00:31.050
Making damn sure the door was open when they were supposed to be in social work and so on.

00:31.705 --> 00:38.335
And that was probably the greatest thing we did during my tenure when we created those centers.

00:38.575 --> 00:42.661
We were much more cost-effective in delivering our services.

00:42.801 --> 00:46.687
We had availability of lots of good professional help.

00:47.628 --> 00:54.218
You know, you might just need a lawyer for a two-hour presentation here to take into an accident investigation or whatever.

00:54.238 --> 00:58.364
But we had those available parts in these centers because it's all located in the major area.

00:58.384 --> 00:59.265
And that was probably what we did.

01:00.123 --> 01:03.527
best decisions that I made there that particular time.

01:03.547 --> 01:07.152
Not only for the engineering convention center, but for the entire university system.

01:07.172 --> 01:14.020
Because we give them another organization representing this grand system.

01:14.040 --> 01:16.183
And they were always first class operations.

01:16.203 --> 01:18.666
There was no piggyback.

01:18.886 --> 01:22.231
Always first class.

01:22.311 --> 01:24.173
And when we started the

01:24.794 --> 01:26.677
Rig training, all field rig training.

01:26.697 --> 01:29.040
See, the independent drillers come to me.

01:29.100 --> 01:32.565
They said, well, we've got, this is about 12 years, come back in the early 80s.

01:32.585 --> 01:37.772
We need some trained rig workers.

01:37.912 --> 01:40.275
So I said, well, here's what we're going to take.

01:40.295 --> 01:42.558
And I said, we have to have a rig.

01:42.578 --> 01:42.999
We have to have this.

01:43.019 --> 01:46.584
And the independent drillers, so they can give us a rig to train on.

01:47.165 --> 01:52.171
They give us the, they underwrote the program, which was rather expensive.

01:52.191 --> 01:53.333
Billy Mack's kid went through it.

01:53.752 --> 01:55.915
So that was a great success.

01:56.095 --> 02:05.687
It got us a lot of publicity with the legislature.

02:06.047 --> 02:11.494
Bill Clements come out and he was governor.

02:11.634 --> 02:22.408
Oh, the city of Abilene was giving a big barbecue for our facilities and he invited them to make it.

02:22.760 --> 02:48.362
Looking back on those 19 years, is there any area of service, I don't mean geographic area, but any topic that you wish you all could have done more?

02:52.443 --> 02:56.930
Were you frustrated that you couldn't have served this or this or this industry?

02:57.991 --> 02:59.674
No, we couldn't serve them.

02:59.914 --> 03:01.096
We had no boundaries.

03:01.517 --> 03:09.529
See, the Engineering Extension Service is the only agency in the state of Texas that has a statewide mandate to provide probation and technical training on the extension basis.

03:09.549 --> 03:10.530
We had no conduct.

03:10.590 --> 03:13.815
We saw something like you mentioned, but we got on it.

03:13.835 --> 03:14.596
We jumped on it right away.

03:15.217 --> 03:20.425
And normally in all those cases, there's some agency, some trade association or some

03:21.198 --> 03:25.284
to take the lead role in it as far as the money raises and so on.

03:25.545 --> 03:27.508
What were your favorite groups to work with?

03:31.153 --> 03:33.657
There must have been some that were more pleasant than others, though.

03:33.677 --> 03:37.984
I don't know.

03:38.004 --> 03:43.031
I was pretty close to the telephone association.

03:43.051 --> 03:45.135
I was pretty close to the electric co-ops.

03:45.155 --> 03:48.640
I was close to the fire people throughout the state of Texas.

03:49.835 --> 03:53.819
Who were the key state officials that you worked with?

03:53.839 --> 03:56.101
Was that 19 years?

03:56.121 --> 03:56.261
Mm-hmm.

03:56.421 --> 04:02.807
No, but you can name your favorites, the ones that you would say thank you to.

04:03.588 --> 04:12.777
I guess the one that probably was my favorite, and I don't know why I say it.

04:12.797 --> 04:15.279
But anyway, I like Mark White.

04:16.380 --> 04:18.002
Mark White and I, too, Jill Reynolds.

04:18.404 --> 04:24.930
See, Joe Reynolds and White was in the law practice together, and then White was his junior member.

04:24.950 --> 04:32.798
And then when he made Secretary of State, of course, I knew White when he was only with Reynolds in his law firm.

04:32.818 --> 04:40.105
And Mark White, Secretary of State, come on up and run for governor.

04:40.125 --> 04:45.711
I felt that he was the only governor I really, really knew, you know, for any future.

04:46.754 --> 04:50.299
I mean, I've known all the government, but I mean, you really know them.

04:50.319 --> 04:57.910
So I guess that's one reason I felt it close to him.

04:57.930 --> 05:00.074
Of course, Bill Preston helped me out an awful lot.

05:00.755 --> 05:05.842
Anytime I wanted an appointment with any senator or representative, I could call Bill if you'd have an appointment.

05:05.862 --> 05:08.807
This was while he was state chairman.

05:08.847 --> 05:15.917
Well, while he was a representative and as he served, you know, he served as chairman of the state of the House Appropriation Committee for about 10 or 12 years.

05:16.505 --> 05:24.295
Whenever I was in a department with any senator or House of Representatives, I'd call him Bill.

05:24.315 --> 05:24.775
He'd have a department.

05:24.795 --> 05:29.882
Of course, Bill Moore, he was in the Senate.

05:29.902 --> 05:33.586
I had done a lot of other work for Bill Moore on his outside.

05:33.606 --> 05:34.928
He had that back at A&M.

05:34.948 --> 05:38.092
I wrote the chart for that back at A&M.

05:38.112 --> 05:41.196
I talked about that.

05:41.429 --> 05:50.624
Can you give me an example of lobbying at work where you called somebody and they made the wheels turn?

05:51.204 --> 05:54.590
Describe it.

05:54.930 --> 05:56.453
For a specific project?

05:56.673 --> 06:00.078
If there was one, you can think of?

06:00.099 --> 06:05.407
Yeah, I can think of one from far.

06:05.547 --> 06:08.652
There was a big push to create

06:09.323 --> 06:12.809
two or three more fire fields in the state of Texas.

06:12.830 --> 06:17.158
And they didn't want to be a part of A&M's.

06:17.178 --> 06:20.704
They wanted to create their own, take a bunch of volunteer fire departments.

06:20.724 --> 06:23.149
They thought, well, they should have their own fire field.

06:23.169 --> 06:25.633
No way in the world it could ever support them.

06:25.653 --> 06:30.302
But still, volunteer fire departments carry a lot around in rural areas with elected representatives.

06:31.396 --> 06:37.923
And so they put on a push to create a fire field somewhere out of the Woodlands area.

06:38.544 --> 06:41.727
Now this was long before the Woodlands was there.

06:41.747 --> 06:45.271
And they bypassed us completely.

06:46.813 --> 06:47.313
And I got a call one day.

06:47.333 --> 06:49.135
A member of the representative's name was down in that area.

06:49.155 --> 06:57.144
He said, what did I think about the, whatever, it was Missouri County that was pushing so hard.

06:57.164 --> 07:01.048
I think Missouri County was pushing so hard to tell you what it was, Harris County.

07:01.417 --> 07:07.546
I said, well, it's a very expensive training program.

07:07.566 --> 07:08.127
I said, it's not cheap.

07:08.147 --> 07:11.071
I said, you've got to have good training.

07:11.331 --> 07:13.194
You've got to be damn careful.

07:13.214 --> 07:15.998
And I said, true, fuel's expensive, and you've got to burn.

07:16.018 --> 07:19.003
You can't just light a match and say, here, now we're going to go put it out.

07:19.023 --> 07:20.164
I said, you've got to.

07:20.184 --> 07:24.290
If you're going to have any fire training or those types of training, you've got to have hands-on training.

07:24.711 --> 07:26.213
They've got to smell the heat and feel the heat.

07:27.275 --> 07:28.116
But anyway, so.

07:28.855 --> 07:31.679
He said, well, they're putting this consortium together.

07:32.421 --> 07:34.564
I know that they're going to be coming to us for appropriation.

07:36.988 --> 07:41.575
And so we got that stopped.

07:41.595 --> 07:44.580
Now, the way I stopped it, I went down to the organizer.

07:44.680 --> 07:48.606
And I said, tell me, what do y'all guys want?

07:48.626 --> 07:49.768
What do you want?

07:49.788 --> 07:51.010
Tell me what you want.

07:51.030 --> 07:55.116
Give me an opportunity to say no.

07:55.703 --> 08:01.010
So finally, what the big gripe was, there was a volunteer fire department, they didn't have anybody place to train on Saturday.

08:01.030 --> 08:03.453
They opened the damn fire field on Saturday morning.

08:03.473 --> 08:04.415
And that was their big gripe.

08:05.096 --> 08:12.185
You know, they worked five days a week, and they didn't have any place to, come on, it was too expensive depending on nights and so forth.

08:12.205 --> 08:13.988
And so I said, hey, what's the problem?

08:14.008 --> 08:14.969
What time do you want it?

08:15.129 --> 08:16.631
You want it to open it at 10 on Saturday?

08:17.452 --> 08:18.293
Burn it till 6.

08:20.356 --> 08:21.338
But we killed that one.

08:21.358 --> 08:25.423
But another, at the same time, they were trying to get one out in West Texas.

08:25.910 --> 08:28.013
And the word got to them then what we did.

08:28.033 --> 08:30.117
Then they used the excuse that we live too far away.

08:30.157 --> 08:32.701
We can't come that distance.

08:32.721 --> 08:38.390
All right, can you give an example of where you needed some help in the legislature?

08:38.791 --> 08:49.468
You needed to get a bill passed or some funding and give an example of where some people stepped up and helped the extension service.

08:49.488 --> 08:50.550
No, I'll request it.

08:51.222 --> 08:52.183
state-appropriate money.

08:52.203 --> 08:58.471
The only state-appropriate money, the way I used my state-appropriate money was from the volunteer fire departments in the rural water district.

08:58.491 --> 09:00.273
See, the rest of this is $3 million.

09:02.135 --> 09:07.362
They didn't support our programs like power and great television.

09:07.382 --> 09:16.453
No, we never, I don't ever, I didn't, I presented my, I worked with the LBP.

09:17.598 --> 09:23.445
I had the LBB over two months before anybody else did, and I was taking it to what my request was going to be.

09:23.465 --> 09:27.270
But I had problems that the legislature couldn't fuss about.

09:27.390 --> 09:30.874
Volunteer fire department, rural water districts.

09:31.055 --> 09:34.118
They couldn't fuss at themselves.

09:34.138 --> 09:40.766
And it was, you know, even though we had a $39 million budget, it only cost the state $3 million.

09:40.786 --> 09:44.731
And we didn't even have any in-house fights with the board or other agencies.

09:45.532 --> 09:46.153
In fact, I had

09:46.572 --> 09:51.960
on numerous occasions, challenged that extension service to get their money the way I got money.

09:52.541 --> 10:04.999
And John Hutchison, one time, had Bill Moore and, I don't know, four or five others, along with, at that time, I don't know who was the chancellor of the system, I guess he was Dr. Erickson.

10:05.019 --> 10:10.967
But anyway, he had them on, and his main complaint was that he couldn't compete with us.

10:12.890 --> 10:14.773
He had a different clientele.

10:14.956 --> 10:19.504
You might come back and tell me a poor group of politics.

10:19.524 --> 10:26.836
Alright, now you reported to Benson and Calhoun under Dr. Williams when you were first.

10:28.318 --> 10:39.377
Dr. Williams has the heart attack and then the system is recreated, the chancellor of the system recreated in 76.

10:39.897 --> 10:42.159
And Jarvis Miller becomes president.

10:42.339 --> 10:44.942
Ludicke went in and served for Williams.

10:45.202 --> 10:45.443
Right.

10:46.023 --> 10:50.728
And tell them about working with General Ludicke.

10:50.748 --> 10:52.990
No problem.

10:53.230 --> 10:58.956
He was a general and I was a colonel, so I had to say yes sir and I knew it, but I didn't argue with him.

10:58.976 --> 11:02.680
How long did it take him to make up his mind about something?

11:02.700 --> 11:09.887
Well, when they told me I was going to move the headquarters over to Henderson Hall,

11:10.340 --> 11:13.985
At that time, Fred told me, now this is temporary.

11:14.065 --> 11:16.609
And Dr. Wheaton told me this is temporary.

11:16.629 --> 11:19.132
But they've all agreed with me that we had to get out of there.

11:19.393 --> 11:20.895
It was ISO for the university.

11:20.915 --> 11:22.617
And that's the approach I took.

11:22.637 --> 11:23.258
It's not for me.

11:23.939 --> 11:26.082
Now this is from that down at the south?

11:26.102 --> 11:28.185
The business hall, yeah.

11:28.205 --> 11:37.397
So Ludicke was in command when they were going to let the contract for Henderson Hall fix that.

11:37.418 --> 11:37.798
And...

11:39.415 --> 11:45.380
When I went down there to see the plants, they had my reproduction shop up on the third floor.

11:45.400 --> 11:48.082
And I always had an old reproduction center.

11:48.102 --> 11:49.523
You may say that was wrong.

11:49.544 --> 11:50.284
I admit it was probably wrong.

11:50.304 --> 11:52.186
But in industrial economics, I had my own reproduction center.

11:52.206 --> 11:54.828
So I could control the time.

11:55.068 --> 11:57.991
I could move my projects around any way I wanted to.

11:58.011 --> 11:58.771
So I had to deliver them.

11:59.192 --> 12:01.033
But I had a reproduction shop for day one.

12:01.273 --> 12:02.975
It had a lot of people managed.

12:03.115 --> 12:06.157
Now, this was for printing materials?

12:06.298 --> 12:06.978
Yes.

12:07.078 --> 12:09.220
All my artistic work.

12:09.622 --> 12:12.686
Because all mine was sponsored research.

12:12.706 --> 12:18.333
And, you know, when I brought down, and I had Exxon on, I had contracts for Exxon for seven or eight straight years.

12:19.475 --> 12:20.676
And you made it to their board.

12:20.756 --> 12:22.999
Well, they expected a first-class presentation.

12:23.019 --> 12:25.422
They didn't want to see some carbon paper stuck out.

12:25.442 --> 12:27.705
So, I mean, I had, that was quality.

12:27.725 --> 12:30.269
That's, that was, and that was built into the price.

12:30.289 --> 12:32.051
To operate that thing, that was built into the price.

12:33.112 --> 12:33.773
But anyway.

12:34.107 --> 12:42.117
When I went down to see him down at that time, I said, you know, we can't have that reproduction facility on the third floor.

12:42.258 --> 12:44.260
I said, we only got one little bitty elevator.

12:44.280 --> 12:47.244
And I said, there'll be stuff coming up and down.

12:47.264 --> 12:52.731
And of course, I'd gone into really, you know, developing good lesson plans, good technical manuals.

12:52.751 --> 12:55.135
And we had quite a reproduction shop still do that.

12:56.236 --> 12:57.197
And they built that building.

12:57.398 --> 13:00.081
And by the way, you know, we even paid for our building.

13:00.787 --> 13:04.711
We built that $250,000 building out at the annex.

13:05.092 --> 13:07.795
We built that $500,000 Fred Benson.

13:07.855 --> 13:11.178
He put $500,000 out of the engineering firm.

13:11.198 --> 13:12.340
I put $500,000 out of the engineering firm.

13:12.380 --> 13:13.921
That long building, we built that.

13:14.682 --> 13:15.443
Has this material.

13:15.563 --> 13:20.228
I built that out of my fees, you know.

13:20.248 --> 13:26.615
But to ask her whether it was right or wrong, I operated the engineering extension service as you would.

13:26.635 --> 13:29.338
I charged for everything.

13:29.358 --> 13:29.899
There was no...

13:30.959 --> 13:33.061
I mean, it was all built into the price.

13:34.062 --> 13:36.764
And so we were able to do these kind of things.

13:36.784 --> 13:41.629
But anyway, we got that, so General Lukey said, I don't know anything about reproductions.

13:41.649 --> 13:46.153
I said, well, let's put it down on the first floor so people can get in and get out.

13:46.173 --> 13:46.793
And we moved that down.

13:46.813 --> 13:50.597
Well, I called, who'd have had that before?

13:50.617 --> 13:51.217
Who had that?

13:51.277 --> 13:53.840
Whoever had that chopper, he couldn't really do it.

13:54.340 --> 13:57.984
And General Lukey, out on the phone, he said, make those things.

13:58.004 --> 13:59.565
Right from his office.

14:00.102 --> 14:01.444
Who was that guy that had that?

14:03.667 --> 14:05.229
Pam, I don't remember.

14:05.249 --> 14:21.930
All right, then when General Ludeke steps aside, then Frank.

14:21.950 --> 14:22.971
Let's see.

14:23.032 --> 14:24.533
That's when Jarvis comes in.

14:24.614 --> 14:25.755
Jarvis is president.

14:26.478 --> 14:28.962
And Dr. Williams is here for another couple of years.

14:28.982 --> 14:29.543
Right.

14:29.563 --> 14:33.488
How did your reporting process change then?

14:34.169 --> 14:35.291
To whom did you report?

14:38.175 --> 14:40.419
Well, they made Pinson's vice president of engineering.

14:41.660 --> 14:43.183
So I still reported up to him for that.

14:43.363 --> 14:43.723
Okay.

14:45.586 --> 14:51.395
They didn't have, I guess I reported directly to Jarvis to continue at Peyton because I know I never did go up through Prescott.

14:51.415 --> 14:54.339
Okay.

14:54.359 --> 14:55.641
To my knowledge, they didn't.

14:56.498 --> 15:00.063
But now, you know, I'd give them a continuing education after five years.

15:00.083 --> 15:02.546
You know, I only took that job for five years.

15:02.566 --> 15:06.411
So after five years, I'll continue the education.

15:06.452 --> 15:09.416
And that fifth year came up just about the time Jarvis took over.

15:09.436 --> 15:11.058
Okay.

15:11.078 --> 15:11.418
All right.

15:11.438 --> 15:19.609
So you then, by and large, reported to the system, not through the president's office.

15:20.671 --> 15:24.736
Well, I can't say that because I had to make my budget presentation one year with Jarvis.

15:24.957 --> 15:25.257
Okay.

15:25.540 --> 15:30.185
All right, when he would have a staff meeting of his key people, did you meet with them?

15:31.687 --> 15:42.138
All right, did Dr. Williams, when he gathered the agencies, you met with them when he was chancellor?

15:42.238 --> 15:44.221
Well, one or two meetings we had, yes.

15:44.641 --> 15:48.045
All right, then when he left, Frank Hubert became the chancellor.

15:52.290 --> 15:54.552
Did the routine change at all?

15:55.291 --> 15:59.816
He was a Fred Benson man, you knew that, Frank Hubert.

16:00.858 --> 16:07.746
The first thing he told me, the first thing he did when he became chancellor was Fred Benson's salary.

16:07.786 --> 16:11.490
He liked Fred and Dean Hubert.

16:11.510 --> 16:14.273
I think they were family friends too.

16:14.914 --> 16:17.737
All right, then take me on up through the 80s.

16:17.797 --> 16:24.285
Were there any changes in the routine with different presidents and different chancellors?

16:25.295 --> 16:30.622
Well, of course, Richardson took over in 84.

16:32.223 --> 16:32.864
All right, wait.

16:32.904 --> 16:34.246
We skipped the man from Purdue.

16:35.467 --> 16:36.028
No, Hanson.

16:36.168 --> 16:36.549
Hanson.

16:36.589 --> 16:38.932
He was chancellor.

16:39.172 --> 16:43.357
Well, it was about 84 when he was.

16:43.377 --> 16:45.360
Oh, and Richardson became dean of engineering?

16:45.660 --> 16:46.401
Oh, I'm sorry.

16:46.481 --> 16:47.442
Yeah, yeah.

16:47.462 --> 16:50.626
He became dean of engineering.

16:50.646 --> 16:51.547
All right.

16:51.567 --> 16:54.711
And he was also vice chancellor.

16:54.995 --> 16:56.737
Describe his management style.

17:02.422 --> 17:08.128
Was it, it was less direct than Benson and Calhoun had been?

17:08.228 --> 17:17.918
Herb never, the whole time that he was there, maybe before the time I left, Herb never said a crossword.

17:17.938 --> 17:22.302
Herb and I got along superbly.

17:24.155 --> 17:27.519
I can't say enough good things about Herb Richardson and where I come from.

17:27.539 --> 17:29.581
He never objected to a thing I wanted to do.

17:29.941 --> 17:32.825
He proved everything I sent down there.

17:32.845 --> 17:39.111
I met with him once a month, and there was no problem.

17:39.452 --> 17:53.267
Herb's problems was caused by his dad, Jack Flipsey, Ken Hall, and we only had one conflict.

17:54.327 --> 18:00.256
Now, you've got to realize, I'm a very organized person.

18:00.276 --> 18:02.499
I believe in an organization chart.

18:02.519 --> 18:03.681
I believe it, and I follow it.

18:04.422 --> 18:08.268
But anyway, you want me to put this on tape?

18:08.288 --> 18:08.989
Cut it off.

18:09.009 --> 18:14.216
Let me just talk a little bit.

18:14.236 --> 18:23.490
As you look back, you served 19 years under a number of different presidents and chancellors.

18:23.740 --> 18:28.926
I'm not going to ask the negative, but in the positive, to which ones would you give the highest?

18:33.230 --> 18:34.212
As many as you want to.

18:34.292 --> 18:36.634
Which ones deserve the highest credit?

18:36.654 --> 18:37.215
During that 19-year period?

18:40.719 --> 18:45.204
Of course, I'd have to say Dr. Liggins would take number one.

18:45.224 --> 18:47.006
Why?

18:47.026 --> 18:52.532
Well, I just think he's more knowledgeable about the types of programs that the engineering protection services have.

18:52.552 --> 18:53.713
I think if he...

18:54.301 --> 18:58.706
He accepted them on their merit, not as second class.

18:58.887 --> 19:03.372
He never did give me the treatment that we were second class to anybody, or to anybody else.

19:03.392 --> 19:05.935
He always was fair.

19:06.376 --> 19:11.041
He was very easy to talk to.

19:14.545 --> 19:15.066
Who else?

19:16.147 --> 19:17.329
Well, of course, Mr. Benson.

19:18.110 --> 19:20.072
I'm taking him from the top down now.

19:20.812 --> 19:24.457
Mr. Benson and I had such a long-term relationship with each other.

19:24.477 --> 19:32.688
We had it from about 55 to 54, whenever he became 15, until he got totally retired.

19:32.708 --> 19:35.773
We had a good relationship after he retired.

19:37.595 --> 19:41.601
Fred was always to the point, which I like.

19:41.621 --> 19:43.343
Fred had a lot of characteristics that I like.

19:43.778 --> 19:53.311
He always, if you're going to go out of town with him, you say you pick him up at 7.30, he was standing out on the court waiting for you at 7.30.

19:53.332 --> 20:04.247
He'd always ask you if he was going to go to a meeting, whether it be a legislative meeting, like, Jim, is there anything you want me to say?

20:04.267 --> 20:04.928
He'd always ask me that question.

20:04.948 --> 20:05.829
Is there anything you want me to comment on?

20:05.849 --> 20:06.350
And I always said no.

20:07.431 --> 20:10.275
I think Frederick was a very smart individual.

20:10.295 --> 20:12.098
He certainly commanded the

20:12.500 --> 20:14.523
the attention of a lot of people.

20:14.543 --> 20:16.966
When he spoke, a lot of people listened.

20:16.986 --> 20:18.969
And I admired that.

20:18.989 --> 20:21.833
So I'd have to put him off the top.

20:22.013 --> 20:27.341
And of course, the next man was Calhoun.

20:27.361 --> 20:31.286
I always talked a lot about Calhoun.

20:31.306 --> 20:32.248
He had a lot of working relationships together.

20:32.268 --> 20:40.920
But in my opinion, I'm not saying one was better than the other, but in my opinion, we had a completely different type of leadership.

20:41.947 --> 20:47.194
After the middle 80s, it was completely different from 84.

20:47.214 --> 20:48.936
Did it become more bureaucratic?

20:50.037 --> 20:51.940
Yes, it was strictly bureaucratic.

20:51.960 --> 20:55.985
You didn't feel at ease picking up the phone and calling them.

20:56.766 --> 21:01.712
I never did it in the first place, but I always knew that I could if I wanted to talk to Dr. Williams or Calhoun.

21:01.732 --> 21:07.340
I didn't have to worry about Dr. Williams or Calhoun chewing me out for calling Dr. Williams or vice versa.

21:07.360 --> 21:10.063
Mr. Benson, you know, I didn't ever do it.

21:10.567 --> 21:14.873
to my knowledge, but I always felt comfortable in doing such a thing like that.

21:14.893 --> 21:18.499
We were more, in my opinion, we were more professional there.

21:18.699 --> 21:20.902
We respected each other more.

21:20.922 --> 21:22.645
We had a great deal of respect for each other.

21:22.745 --> 21:35.784
And I think that was probably the one ingredient that made those change, and I think it forward to the time I retired in 92.

21:37.968 --> 21:38.869
We had a closeness.

21:40.553 --> 21:45.460
I talked to them as my friend, and not only as my boss, but my friend.

21:46.541 --> 21:46.741
All right.

21:46.761 --> 21:56.755
Now, other than your senior partners, whom did you turn to for advice and counsel and input most often?

21:57.055 --> 21:57.756
To my committees.

21:58.437 --> 22:05.507
I had advisory committees in every sector of my engineering station service program, made up of the leaders in their field.

22:05.527 --> 22:08.451
Like the telephone associations, I'd have top telephone members.

22:08.903 --> 22:11.806
I had somebody from the power companies.

22:11.826 --> 22:14.048
And we had advisory committees.

22:14.068 --> 22:18.533
We had one whole advisory committee for the engineering intensive, had one meeting with you.

22:18.613 --> 22:21.797
And I'd call it in various parts of the state.

22:21.817 --> 22:26.141
My other committee members would, you know, just pick up the phone and ask them.

22:26.161 --> 22:29.585
And I kept them informed.

22:29.605 --> 22:35.211
And if it was on my telephone committee, you got, and I didn't delusion with everything, but the things they ought to see, I sent it to them.

22:35.231 --> 22:38.134
But that's who I got help from, my users.

22:38.654 --> 22:46.461
As you look back, can you think of any decisions you wish that Texas A&M had made that it didn't make?

22:49.804 --> 22:52.967
Well, I think they should have gone for it.

22:52.987 --> 23:00.374
No, I can't say that because I don't have the background.

23:00.775 --> 23:01.115
All right.

23:01.135 --> 23:02.536
Let's talk about that a minute.

23:03.037 --> 23:05.539
Co-education.

23:05.840 --> 23:15.688
higher admission requirements, racial integration, broadening the curriculum, non-compulsory core, all those came in the 60s.

23:17.009 --> 23:19.471
Did those affect your effort?

23:20.112 --> 23:20.332
No.

23:21.053 --> 23:23.635
No, they helped my effort.

23:23.655 --> 23:31.582
You'd be surprised as to how many people, you know, I always traveled with an Indian detention car on the sign up with my Roman billboard.

23:31.602 --> 23:35.745
And you'd be surprised if the number of people would stop me and ask me questions or give them information.

23:36.130 --> 23:40.997
I never took a trip that I didn't come back that I didn't have four or five requests for information.

23:41.017 --> 23:43.761
And the question was, it's like you had.

23:43.781 --> 23:45.644
This girl was affected.

23:47.146 --> 23:50.011
Everybody helped.

23:50.031 --> 23:52.915
The only one that's hurting it is people who don't want to join the program.

23:53.636 --> 24:01.007
Now, you rode to Austin for a number of years to reserve meetings with Earl Rudder.

24:01.493 --> 24:08.540
With Earl, I only went over there about six months with him because I'd always assigned a driver out of my unit to drive for him.

24:08.560 --> 24:13.685
And when I quit that, it's because the last treaty that I assigned as a driver, they got him in West Point.

24:13.705 --> 24:14.946
Oh, I see, I see.

24:15.046 --> 24:19.370
But I only filled in there for a period of about six months, I guess.

24:19.811 --> 24:31.382
So, all right, during those years that you and Mr. Rutter were going to the same meeting then in Austin, describe your relationship with him.

24:32.054 --> 24:38.883
Well, of course, Mr. Rudder was a major general, and I was a colonel.

24:38.903 --> 24:44.490
And so, rank-wide, we were miles apart, and I respected him.

24:44.510 --> 24:48.655
I always addressed John Rudder as General Rudder.

24:48.675 --> 24:52.800
I never one time let myself down around John Rudder.

24:52.820 --> 24:57.606
I always was reasonably formal.

24:58.733 --> 25:04.301
What he did was he was going to his meeting on Monday night, and, you know, he'd have to be back.

25:04.561 --> 25:06.223
He'd be back about 11.30, 12 o'clock.

25:07.145 --> 25:11.871
Mr. Mudder, Mr. Rudder, nominally on the way back to 11.

25:11.891 --> 25:14.535
And he had the ability that he could go to sleep.

25:17.178 --> 25:18.620
He said, well, what did y'all discuss?

25:21.544 --> 25:23.287
Well, we discussed the military quite a bit.

25:23.387 --> 25:25.610
We discussed my unit.

25:25.710 --> 25:27.913
I had a better group.

25:29.159 --> 25:35.447
We discussed military personnel quite a bit.

25:35.467 --> 25:43.537
The university, the only thing that would come up about the university, you know, he'd ask you some questions that had no answer.

25:43.557 --> 25:46.320
He'd say, well, let's say, I don't think he ever asked this question.

25:46.340 --> 25:49.644
He'd just say, these are the types of questions he'd ask.

25:49.664 --> 25:58.255
Well, has making the Corps adoption of the person coming to the university, that had any effect on you?

25:58.724 --> 26:00.767
You know, I'd say, me personally?

26:00.787 --> 26:03.131
He'd say, well, personally and otherwise.

26:03.992 --> 26:04.232
I'd say, no.

26:04.252 --> 26:08.319
We're living in a different world.

26:08.339 --> 26:12.625
And, you know, I said, I wouldn't take all the money in the world from my years I spent in the Corps, Cadets.

26:12.645 --> 26:14.127
I said, that was in 1940.

26:15.690 --> 26:16.751
And I said, I've got two sons.

26:16.992 --> 26:19.696
And I said, they're both in the Corps, but I guarantee you, I didn't push them in the Corps.

26:19.776 --> 26:22.981
They went there on their own.

26:23.001 --> 26:24.944
But we never did get into personalities.

26:24.984 --> 26:27.668
We never did with me, because, as I say, I was two ranks below him.

26:28.373 --> 26:34.301
I didn't have any relationship with him as him being my boss other than in the military.

26:34.622 --> 26:43.334
Can you share any anecdotes or amusing or interesting things that happened going to or from that involved Mr. Rutter?

26:44.676 --> 26:46.338
No, but did anything ever go wrong?

26:46.358 --> 26:49.323
Did you all ever have a flat or get there late or anything like that?

26:49.423 --> 26:51.486
Well, I got stopped several times for speed.

26:51.506 --> 26:51.946
Oh, really?

26:52.147 --> 26:53.188
Oh, yeah.

26:53.489 --> 26:57.334
And what would the Highway Patrol say?

26:57.770 --> 27:01.334
Oh, he gave you... It didn't matter whose car that was?

27:01.975 --> 27:03.517
We were driving a military vehicle.

27:04.638 --> 27:06.561
Mr. Rudd would like to get where he's going fast.

27:06.601 --> 27:08.403
I don't know if anybody's ever told you that before.

27:08.543 --> 27:09.304
No, I didn't know that.

27:09.324 --> 27:15.792
He wasn't allergic to pushing the metal to the pedal.

27:15.812 --> 27:21.098
And I don't know how many tickets he got, but with me, I got for him.

27:21.118 --> 27:22.400
All right, who paid the tickets?

27:23.922 --> 27:25.384
I got the tickets.

27:25.404 --> 27:26.545
Okay, so you don't know.

27:27.166 --> 27:27.787
You don't know?

27:27.927 --> 27:28.107
Okay.

27:28.327 --> 27:28.847
I never did ask.

27:29.248 --> 27:31.470
He always would take the ticket from me.

27:31.530 --> 27:31.730
All right.

27:31.750 --> 27:32.511
He took the one ticket from me.

27:32.531 --> 27:32.751
All right.

27:32.791 --> 27:39.316
When the Highway Patrol would stop, did it impress the Highway Patrol that here was a Major General?

27:40.037 --> 27:41.779
Well, that only happened one time with me.

27:41.859 --> 27:44.581
And I doubt if that Highway Patrol knew a Major General from me.

27:44.601 --> 27:44.861
All right.

27:44.921 --> 27:48.024
So he didn't even talk to the person in the back seat.

27:48.044 --> 27:48.304
Okay.

27:49.525 --> 27:50.506
I'm just talking about one time.

27:50.526 --> 27:51.367
It was late at night.

27:52.708 --> 27:53.909
Mr. Rudder, have a sense of humor?

27:55.110 --> 27:56.211
Very good sense of humor.

27:57.018 --> 27:59.741
Can you give me any example of his?

28:00.802 --> 28:06.928
I told you, I had an infantry battle boot, and we always had the army command to come down while we were going to get camp.

28:06.948 --> 28:13.495
So Mr. Rudder always used my battle boot as one to demonstrate and put on their submission.

28:13.515 --> 28:20.302
So one day we was having this general come down and float army command, and I said, now Kim, I want to do this.

28:20.402 --> 28:25.928
We'll be out here, train you at 11 o'clock, get me a map, tell me specifically where you're going to be with all of these.

28:26.701 --> 28:31.506
So I said, fine, I've done this a dozen times for me.

28:31.626 --> 28:39.054
So we decided to have an infantry tank, an attack.

28:39.074 --> 28:44.279
And I picked out a beautiful valley, and it had a nice roll of trees.

28:44.299 --> 28:50.886
And we'd come right, so I said, no, we're going to come right down with our tanks.

28:50.906 --> 28:52.788
And so, Mr. Rudder and the other general drove up.

28:53.289 --> 28:55.611
I went out and reported to him.

28:56.722 --> 28:57.543
Oh, he said, oh.

28:58.684 --> 29:02.368
And I said to this gentleman, I said, now there's a lot of wood rattlers here.

29:03.469 --> 29:09.636
And I said, in fact, I said, there's one right by your foot.

29:10.918 --> 29:13.661
Oh, he's a little bit short there.

29:13.681 --> 29:16.924
And I said, with your boots on, it won't bother you.

29:16.944 --> 29:18.005
But anyway, we went up to this thing.

29:18.025 --> 29:20.168
By that time, boy, everything was different.

29:20.188 --> 29:20.989
I mean, I had that deal.

29:21.009 --> 29:22.951
I always had the time right there.

29:24.192 --> 29:26.695
They'd unload all the time, and they'd get in for a time.

29:27.670 --> 29:30.473
So Mr. Rubber asked him to walk it off.

29:30.493 --> 29:35.117
But anyway, I told this gentleman, I said, sir, I said, there's another rattlesnake that crashed by your foot.

29:35.137 --> 29:39.121
And I just put my foot back there and stopped that.

29:39.141 --> 29:40.963
He said, didn't bite me, did it?

29:41.103 --> 29:42.104
I said, no, sir, he didn't bite you.

29:42.124 --> 29:43.245
So I got into his car.

29:43.265 --> 29:45.147
He said, now, are you sure that rattlesnake didn't bite me?

29:45.167 --> 29:46.067
I said, officer, he didn't bite you.

29:46.087 --> 29:50.171
Mr. Rubber said, I'd like to see you at 1 o'clock today.

29:50.191 --> 29:53.454
And I thought he was going to get me for telling me about the damn rattlesnake.

29:53.474 --> 29:56.277
He said, god damn it, Colonel.

29:56.712 --> 30:04.239
He said, when I said, made it realistic, he said, I didn't want you to run over us.

30:04.259 --> 30:09.903
I said, well, I said, at that slope, I said, you know, I said, to make it realistic, we had to come take part of that slope.

30:09.924 --> 30:12.726
He said, I didn't want it that damn close.

30:12.746 --> 30:21.754
As far as you know, when Earl Rutter was president of A&M, to whom did he turn for advice most often?

30:22.094 --> 30:25.437
Whose advice did he listen to most carefully?

30:27.205 --> 30:40.700
You mean from in-house?

30:40.720 --> 30:42.643
All right, then you.

30:42.663 --> 30:44.104
It might surprise you, though, if you didn't know.

30:44.124 --> 30:46.287
It might be some instructor down there or something.

30:46.307 --> 30:48.429
You said in-house, all right, let's go out of the house.

30:48.990 --> 30:51.012
Away from the campus, whose advice did he hear?

30:51.052 --> 30:53.415
Well, he had here to the board's advice.

30:54.644 --> 30:56.906
He had a lot of respect for the board.

30:56.926 --> 30:58.989
Who were the key board members during his day?

31:00.430 --> 31:02.412
Well, let's see.

31:02.633 --> 31:03.914
When did he die, in 59?

31:05.516 --> 31:07.178
Oh, in 70.

31:07.518 --> 31:07.979
In 69?

31:07.999 --> 31:09.580
Okay.

31:09.640 --> 31:11.723
He died in March of 70.

31:14.826 --> 31:19.171
Sterling Evans, Zachary, Clyde Wells.

31:19.211 --> 31:23.115
Clyde Wells was on it, and Mrs. Wilson from Lubbock was on it.

31:23.433 --> 31:29.258
And I don't know whether Norman Mosier was on it at that time.

31:29.278 --> 31:30.584
I don't either.

31:31.046 --> 31:31.789
And I don't know whether Mr.
