WEBVTT

00:02.090 --> 00:05.214
Full-time center managers. And they had their 
respective areas that they were out constantly

00:05.234 --> 00:09.761
seeing what we could do. Need study. And then the 
divisions, so we wouldn't have any conflict with

00:11.723 --> 00:17.011
the divisions, they signed their staff to that 
center. And those staff didn't report it to their

00:17.031 --> 00:19.534
head of the division. Didn't report to the city 
manager. The center manager had no

00:20.696 --> 00:23.960
administrative control over any of the people. 
All his was from facilities, providing need

00:23.980 --> 00:31.050
studies, making sure the door was open when they 
spoke to me and so forth and so on. And that was

00:31.705 --> 00:35.531
probably the greatest thing we did during my 
tenure. We created those centers. We were much

00:38.575 --> 00:42.661
more cost-effective in delivering our services. 
We had availability of lots of good professional

00:42.801 --> 00:46.687
help. You know, you might just need a lawyer for a 
two-hour presentation here pertaining to

00:47.628 --> 00:54.218
accident investigation or whatever. But we had 
those available parts in these centers because

00:54.238 --> 00:58.364
it's all located in major areas. And that was 
probably one of the the best decisions that I made

01:00.123 --> 01:03.447
there at that time. Not only for the engineering 
convention center, but for the entire university

01:03.467 --> 01:07.152
system. Because we give them another, another 
organization represented in this grand system.

01:14.040 --> 01:16.183
And they were always first class operations. 
There was no piggyback. They were always first

01:19.027 --> 01:22.231
class. And when we started to offer the rig 
training, all-field rig training, and see the

01:24.794 --> 01:32.565
independent drillers come to me and say, well, 
we've got, this is about 12, 13 years ago, back in

01:24.794 --> 01:32.565
1980. We need some trained rig workers. So I said, 
well, here's what you're going to take. And I said,

01:40.295 --> 01:42.678
we have to have a rig. We have to have it. And the 
independent drillers, so they can give us rig to

01:43.219 --> 01:46.584
train on. They give us the, they underwrote the 
program, which was rather expensive. Billy

01:52.191 --> 01:53.333
Mack's kid went through it. and said it was the 
greatest training he ever had in his life. But we

01:58.358 --> 02:00.721
believed on hands-on training. We believed in 
theory, but we believed on hands-on training. And

02:04.425 --> 02:07.189
so that was a great success. It got us a lot of 
publicity with the legislature. Bill Clements

02:09.552 --> 02:11.294
came out. He was governor. I don't even remember 
where to go. The city of Abilene was giving a big

02:15.159 --> 02:20.966
barbecue for our facilities. And he invited them 
to make an avenue. Looking

02:22.760 --> 02:39.988
back on those 19 years, is there any area of 
service? I don't mean geographic area, but any

02:40.589 --> 02:48.362
topic that you wish you all could have done more?

02:52.443 --> 02:56.930
Were you frustrated that you couldn't have served 
this or this or this industry? No, we couldn't

02:57.991 --> 02:59.674
serve them. We had no boundaries. See, the 
Engineering Extension Service is the only agency

03:01.517 --> 03:09.529
in the state of Texas that has a statewide mandate 
to provide probation and technical training on an

03:01.517 --> 03:09.529
extension basis. We had no condominium. We saw 
something like you mentioned. Yeah, we saw it, but

03:12.433 --> 03:13.815
we got on it. We jumped on it right away. And 
normally, in all those cases, there's some

03:15.217 --> 03:20.425
agency, some trade association or something. you 
know, that affected me growing as far as the money

03:21.198 --> 03:25.284
raising. What were your favorite groups to work 
with?

03:31.153 --> 03:33.657
There must have been some that were more pleasant 
than others, though. I

03:33.677 --> 03:37.984
don't know. I was pretty close to the telephone 
association. I was pretty close to the romantic

03:43.652 --> 03:45.535
co-ops. I was pretty close to the fire people 
throughout the state of Texas. Who were the key

03:49.835 --> 03:53.819
state officials that you worked with? Was that 19 
years? No, but you can name your favorites. The

03:58.784 --> 04:02.807
ones that you would say thank you to. I guess the one 
that

04:03.588 --> 04:12.777
probably was my favorite, and I don't know why I say 
that. But anyway, I like Mark White. Mark White and

04:16.380 --> 04:18.002
I did Gil Reynolds. See, Joe Reynolds, Reynolds 
and White was in the law practice together, and

04:18.404 --> 04:24.930
then White was his junior member. And then when he 
made Secretary of State, because I knew White when

04:24.950 --> 04:32.798
he was only with Reynolds in his law firm. And Mark 
White, Secretary of State, come on up and run for

04:32.818 --> 04:40.146
governor. I thought that he's the only governor I 
really, really knew, you know, for any reason. I

04:46.754 --> 04:50.299
mean, I've known all the governors, but I mean, to 
really know them. So I guess that's one reason I

04:50.319 --> 04:58.151
felt the closest

04:50.319 --> 04:58.151
to him. Bill Preston helped me out an awful lot. Any 
time I wanted a appointment with any senator or

05:00.755 --> 05:04.340
representative, I could call Bill. He'd hand me a 
formal. This was while he was? State chairman.

05:08.847 --> 05:15.917
Well, while he was a representative and as he 
served, you know, he served as chairman of the

05:08.847 --> 05:15.917
State House Appropriation Committee for about 10 
or 12 years. Whenever I was in a department with any

05:16.505 --> 05:22.192
senator or House of Representatives, I'd call 
Bill. He'd have it fun. Of course, Bill Moore, when

05:24.795 --> 05:41.196
he was in the Senate, I'd done a lot of other work for 
Bill Moore on his outside, and he had that back of

05:24.795 --> 05:41.196
A&M on him, the chart for that back of A&M, and he'd 
talk to everybody about that. Can you give me an

05:41.429 --> 05:50.624
example of lobbying at work where you called 
somebody and they made the wheels turn? Describe.

05:54.930 --> 05:56.453
For a specific project? If there was one. You can 
think of them? Yeah. I can think of one in five.

06:05.547 --> 06:08.652
There was a big push to create two or three more fire 
fields in the state of Texas, and they didn't want

06:09.323 --> 06:17.158
to be a part of A&M. They wanted to create their own, 
take a bunch of volunteer fire departments. They

06:21.205 --> 06:23.149
thought, you know, they should have their own fire 
field. No way in the world it could ever support

06:23.169 --> 06:25.633
that. But still, volunteer fire departments 
carry a lot of rank in rural areas, which would let

06:25.653 --> 06:30.302
you represent them. And so they put on a push to 
create a fire field somewhere out in Woodlands

06:31.396 --> 06:37.923
area. Now this was long before the Woodlands was 
built. And they bypassed us completely. And I got a

06:46.813 --> 06:49.135
call one day from a member of the representative 
name down in that area. He said, what did I think

06:49.155 --> 06:57.945
about the, whatever,

06:49.155 --> 06:57.945
the Brazoria County that was pushing so hard. I 
think the Brazoria County was pushing so hard. I'm

06:59.266 --> 07:01.048
going to tie in with Harris County. I said, well, 
it's a very expensive training program. I said,

07:07.566 --> 07:08.127
it's not cheap. I said, you've got to have good 
training. You've got to be damn careful. And I

07:13.214 --> 07:15.998
said, true, the fuel's expensive, and you've got 
to burn. You can't just light a match and say, here,

07:16.018 --> 07:19.644
now we're going to go put it out. I said, if you're 
going to have any fire training or those types of

07:19.664 --> 07:24.290
training, you've got to have hands-on training. 
They've got to smell the heat and feel the heat. But

07:27.275 --> 07:28.116
anyway, so... He said, well, they're putting this 
consortium together now. He said, I know that

07:32.240 --> 07:34.564
they're going to be coming to this for 
appropriation.

07:36.988 --> 07:41.575
And so we got that stopped. Now, the way I stopped 
it, I went down to the organizer, and I said, tell

07:41.595 --> 07:48.606
me, what do you guys want? What do you want? Tell me 
what you want. Give me an opportunity to say no.

07:55.703 --> 08:00.650
So finally, what their big gripe was, is volunteer 
fire department, they didn't have anybody to

07:55.703 --> 08:00.650
place the train on Saturday. They opened the damn 
fire to you on Saturday morning. And that was their

08:03.473 --> 08:04.415
big gripe. You know, they worked five days a week, 
and they didn't have anybody to place the... Come

08:05.096 --> 08:12.365
on, it was too expensive to spend the nights and so 
forth. So I said, what's the problem? What time do

08:14.008 --> 08:14.969
you want it? You want it to open at 10 on Saturday? 
Burn it till 6. You know? But we killed that one. But

08:21.358 --> 08:24.682
another, at the same time, they were trying to get 
one out in West Texas. So... And the word got to them

08:25.910 --> 08:28.013
then what we did. Then they used the excuse that we 
live too far away. We can't come that distance. All

08:32.721 --> 08:38.390
right, can you give an example of where you needed 
some help in the legislature? You needed to get a

08:38.791 --> 08:49.468
bill passed or some funding and give an example of 
where some people stepped up and helped the

08:38.791 --> 08:49.468
extension service. No, I'll request one. state 
appropriated money. The only state appropriated

08:52.203 --> 08:58.471
money, the way I used my state appropriated money 
was for the volunteer fire departments in the

08:52.203 --> 08:58.471
rural water district. See, the rest of this is 
three million dollars. They didn't support our

09:02.135 --> 09:07.362
programs like the PAR and the great television. 
No, we never,

09:07.382 --> 09:16.453
I don't ever, I didn't, I presented my, I worked 
with the LBP. I had the LVB over two months before

09:17.598 --> 09:23.445
anybody else did, and I was taking two of them. But I 
had programs that the legislature couldn't fuss

09:23.465 --> 09:27.270
about. Volunteer Fire Department, you know, 
rural water districts. They couldn't fuss if

09:31.055 --> 09:34.118
there was a problem. And it was, you know, even 
though we had a $39 million budget, it was only

09:34.138 --> 09:40.766
costing the state $3 million. And we didn't even 
have any in-house fights with the board or other

09:40.786 --> 09:44.731
agencies. In fact, I had on numerous occasions 
challenged Ag Extension Service to get their

09:46.572 --> 09:51.960
money the way I got mine. And John Dutch said one 
time that Bill Moore and, I don't know, four or five

09:52.541 --> 10:04.758
others, along with at that time, I don't know who 
was the chancellor of the system, I guess it was Dr.

09:52.541 --> 10:04.758
. But anyway, he had them all. And his main 
complaint was that he couldn't compete with us. He

10:12.890 --> 10:14.773
had a different clientele. you know my comeback 
would tell me a poor group all right now uh you

10:14.956 --> 10:39.377
reported to benson and calhoun under dr williams 
when you were first all right dr williams has uh the

10:14.956 --> 10:39.377
heart attack and then the system is recreated the 
the chancellor of the system recreated in 76 And

10:39.897 --> 10:42.159
Jarvis Miller becomes president. And Ludeke went 
in and served for Williams. Right. And tell them

10:46.023 --> 10:50.728
about working with General Ludeke. No problem. He 
and I, he was a general and I was a colonel, so I had to

10:52.850 --> 10:56.574
say yes or no to do it. I didn't argue with him. How 
long did it take him to make up his mind about

10:58.976 --> 11:02.680
something? Well, when they told me I was going to 
move, that they were going to move the

11:02.700 --> 11:09.887
headquarters over to Henderson Hall, At that time 
Fred told me that this is temporary. And Dr.

11:14.065 --> 11:16.609
Williams told me this is temporary. But they've 
all agreed with me that we had to get out of there. It

11:19.393 --> 11:20.674
was that. It was ISO for the university. And that's 
the approach I took. It's not for me. It's, you

11:23.178 --> 11:28.185
know... Now this is from that, down at the south... 
Vistasol, yeah. So Ludeke was in command when they

11:28.205 --> 11:36.917
were going to let the contract for Henderson Hall 
be fixed up. And... When I went down there to see the

11:39.415 --> 11:45.380
plants, they had my reproduction shop up on the 
third floor. And I always had my own reproduction

11:45.400 --> 11:47.222
facility. You may say that's your home. I admit 
it's probably your home. But industrial

11:50.304 --> 11:53.367
economics, I had my own reproduction facility. So 
I could control the time. I could move my projects

11:55.068 --> 11:57.991
around any way I wanted to. So I had to deliver them. 
But I had a reproduction shop from day one that a lot

11:59.192 --> 12:02.414
of people managed. Now, this was for printing 
materials? Yeah. All the artistic work. Because

12:09.622 --> 12:12.686
all of mine was sponsored research. And, you know, 
when I brought down and I had Exxon, I had contracts

12:12.706 --> 12:18.333
for Exxon for seven or eight straight years. And 
you made it to their board. Well, they expected a

12:20.756 --> 12:22.999
first class presentation. They didn't want to see 
some carbon paper stuck out. So, I mean, I had, that

12:25.442 --> 12:27.885
was quality. That was, and that was built into the 
price to operate that thing. That was built into

12:31.050 --> 12:32.051
the price. But anyway, When I went down to see him 
down at the General Ludwig was in charge at that

12:34.107 --> 12:40.155
time. I said, you know, we can't have that 
reproduction facility on the third floor. I said,

12:42.258 --> 12:44.260
well, I've only got one little bitty elevator. And 
I said, will there be stuff coming up and down? And

12:47.264 --> 12:52.731
of course, I'd gone into really developing good 
lesson plans, good technical manuals. And we had

12:52.751 --> 12:55.135
quite a reproduction shop still do that. And they 
built that building. And by the way, we even paid

12:58.018 --> 13:00.081
for our building. We built that $250,000 building 
out at Annex. We built that $500,000 Fred Benson,

13:05.092 --> 13:11.299
he put $500,000 out of the engine extension. We 
built that bomb building. We built that. It has its

13:14.702 --> 13:15.463
materials. I built that out of my fee.

13:20.308 --> 13:22.651
I asked him whether it was right or wrong. I 
operated the engine extension service, if you

13:23.612 --> 13:26.635
will, private business. I charged for 
everything. There was no I mean, it was all built

13:30.959 --> 13:33.061
into the price. And so we were able to do these kind 
of things. But anyway, we got that to General

13:36.784 --> 13:39.627
Lukey's locality. I said, well, let's put it down 
on the first floor so people can get in and get out.

13:46.173 --> 13:46.793
And we moved that down. Well, that caused, who'd 
had that before? Whoever had that chopper, he

13:51.277 --> 13:54.661
wanted to do it. And General Lukey, out on the 
phone, said, right from his office. Who was that

14:00.102 --> 14:01.444
guy that had that? Damn, I don't remember. All 
right, then when

14:05.249 --> 14:22.971
General Ludeke

14:05.249 --> 14:22.971
steps aside, then Frank, let's see. That's when 
Jarvis comes in. Jarvis is president. and Dr.

14:26.478 --> 14:28.962
Williams is here for another couple of years. How 
did your reporting process change then? To whom

14:34.169 --> 14:35.291
did you report?

14:38.175 --> 14:43.183
Well, they made Benson vice president of 
engineering, so I still reported up to him for

14:38.175 --> 14:43.183
that. Okay. They didn't have, I guess I reported 
directly to Jarvis to continue educating,

14:45.586 --> 14:51.395
because I know I never did go up through Prescott. 
Okay. To my knowledge, that didn't happen. But

14:56.498 --> 15:00.063
now, you know, I'd give them a continuing 
education after five years. You know, I only took

15:00.083 --> 15:02.546
that job for five years. So after five years, I was 
out of continuing education. And that fifth year

15:06.452 --> 15:09.416
come up just about the time Jarvis took over. Okay. 
Right. So you then, by and large, reported to the

15:11.438 --> 15:19.609
system, not through the president's office. 
Well, I can't say that because I had to make a budget

15:20.671 --> 15:24.736
presentation one year to Jarvis. Okay. All right, 
when he would have a staff meeting of his key

15:25.540 --> 15:30.185
people, did you meet with them? All right, did Dr. 
Williams, when he gathered the agencies, you met

15:31.687 --> 15:42.138
with them when he was chancellor?

15:42.238 --> 15:44.221
Well, one or two meetings we had, yes. All right, 
then when he left, Frank Hubert became the

15:44.641 --> 15:48.045
chancellor.

15:52.290 --> 15:54.552
Did the routine change at all? Okay. See, he was a 
Fred Benson man. You knew that. Frank Hubert. The

16:00.858 --> 16:07.766
first thing he told me, the first thing he did when 
he became chancellor, he phrased Fred Benson as

16:00.858 --> 16:07.766
hell. He liked Fred. I mean, Fred and Dean Hubert. I 
think they was family. All right. Then take me on up

16:15.234 --> 16:17.737
through the 80s. Were there any changes in the 
routine with different presidents and different

16:17.797 --> 16:24.285
chancellors? Well, of course, Richardson took 
over in

16:25.295 --> 16:30.622
84. All right, no matter. Wait, we skipped the man 
from Purdue. No, Hanson. Hanson. He was

16:36.589 --> 16:38.691
chancellor. Well, it was about 84 when he did it.

16:43.377 --> 16:45.360
Oh, and Richardson became dean of engineering? 
Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah, yeah. He became dean of

16:47.462 --> 16:50.626
engineering. All right. And he was also vice 
chancellor. Describe his management style.

17:01.882 --> 17:02.402
No comment. Was it, it was less direct than Benson 
and Calhoun had been? Herb never, the whole time

17:08.228 --> 17:17.918
that he was there, maybe before the time I left, 
Herb never said a crossword. Herb and I got along

17:17.938 --> 17:22.302
superbly. I can't say enough good things about 
Herb Richardson from where I come from. He never

17:27.539 --> 17:29.581
objected to a thing I wanted to do. He approved 
everything I sent down there. I met with him once a

17:32.845 --> 17:36.949
month.

17:36.969 --> 17:38.851
And there was no problem. Where Herb's problems 
was caused by his dad, Jack Flipsey, Ken, what was

17:38.871 --> 17:49.503
his name? Ken Hall. And we only had one conflict. 
Now, you've got to realize I'm a very organized

17:54.327 --> 18:00.256
person. I believe in an organizational chart. I 
believe it, and I follow it. But anyway, you want me

18:04.422 --> 18:07.967
to put this on tape? Let me cut it off. Let me just 
talk a little

18:09.169 --> 18:14.216
bit. As you look back,

18:14.236 --> 18:23.490
you served 19 years under a number of different 
presidents and chancellors. I'm not going to ask

18:23.740 --> 18:28.925
the negative, but in the positive, to which ones 
would you give the highest?

18:33.229 --> 18:34.210
As many as you want to. Which ones deserve the 
highest credit? Doing that 19-year period?

18:40.717 --> 18:41.157
Of course. I'd have to say Dr. Liggins would take 
number one. Why? Well, I just think he is more

18:47.023 --> 18:52.529
knowledgeable about the types of programs that 
the Engineering Potential Services have. I think

18:52.549 --> 18:53.730
if he... He accepted them on their merit, not as 
second class. He never did give me the feeling that

18:58.887 --> 19:03.372
we were second class to anybody, or to anybody 
else. He always was fair. He was very easy to talk

19:06.376 --> 19:11.041
to.

19:14.545 --> 19:15.066
Who else? Well, of course, Mr. Benson. I'm taking 
him from the top down now. Mr. Benson and I had such a

19:20.812 --> 19:24.457
long-term relationship with each other. We had it 
from about 55 to 54, whenever he'd become dean,

19:24.477 --> 19:32.909
until he got totally retired. We even had a good 
relationship after he retired. Fred was always to

19:37.595 --> 19:41.601
the point, which I like. Fred had a lot of 
characters to call. He always, if you were going to

19:43.778 --> 19:48.985
go out of town with him, you'd say you'd pick him up 
at 7.30. He was standing out on the porch waiting

19:49.005 --> 19:53.311
for you at 7.30. He'd always ask you if you were 
going to go to a meeting, whether it be a

19:53.332 --> 20:03.967
legislative meeting, Jim, is there anything you 
want me to say? He'd always ask me that question. Is

20:04.668 --> 20:05.809
there anything in here that you want me to comment 
on? And I always, you know, I think Fred was a very

20:05.829 --> 20:10.275
smart individual. He certainly commanded the the 
attention of a lot of people. When he spoke, a lot of

20:14.543 --> 20:16.966
people listened. And I admired that in him. So, I'd 
have to put him off the top, and then of course, the

20:18.989 --> 20:27.341
next man was Calhoun. I always told him a lot about 
Calhoun. We had a lot of working relationships

20:29.364 --> 20:32.248
together. But, in my opinion, I'm not saying one 
was better than the other, but in my opinion, we had

20:32.268 --> 20:40.920
completely different types of leadership. after 
the middle 80s. It was completely different from

20:44.931 --> 20:47.194
84. Did it become more bureaucratic? Yes, it was 
strictly bureaucratic. You didn't feel at ease

20:51.960 --> 20:55.985
picking up the phone and calling. I never did it in 
the first place, but I always knew that I could if I

20:56.766 --> 21:01.712
wanted to talk to Dr. Williams or Calhoun. I didn't 
have to worry about Dr. Williams or Calhoun

21:01.732 --> 21:07.340
chewing me out for calling Dr. Williams or vice 
versa. Mr. Benson, I didn't ever do it. to my

21:10.567 --> 21:14.873
knowledge, but I always felt comfortable in doing 
such a thing like that. We were more, in my opinion,

21:14.893 --> 21:18.499
we were more professional there. We respected 
each other more. We had a great deal of respect for

21:20.922 --> 21:22.645
each other. And I think that was probably the one 
ingredient that made those change in that day

21:22.745 --> 21:35.784
before the time I retired in 92.

21:37.968 --> 21:38.869
We had a closeness. I felt to him as my friend, and 
not only as my boss, but my friend. All right. Now,

21:46.759 --> 21:56.754
other than your senior partners, whom did you turn 
to for advice and counsel and input most often? To

21:57.054 --> 21:57.755
my committees. I had advisory committees in every 
sector of my Engineering Detention Service

21:58.456 --> 22:05.507
program made up of the leaders in their field. Like 
the Telephone Association, I'd have top

22:05.527 --> 22:08.451
telephone members. Power company, I had somebody 
from the power company. And we had advisory

22:11.826 --> 22:14.048
committees. We had one whole little advisory 
committee for the engineering attention. It had

22:17.132 --> 22:18.533
one meeting a year. And I'd call it in various parts 
of the state. My other committee members would,

22:21.817 --> 22:25.040
you know, just pick up the phone and ask. And I kept 
them informed. If it was on my telephone

22:29.845 --> 22:32.008
committee, you got it. And I didn't delude you with 
everything, but the things they ought to see, I

22:32.028 --> 22:35.211
sent it to them. But that's who I got help from. My 
users. As you look back, can you think of any

22:38.654 --> 22:46.461
decisions you wish that Texas A&M had made that it 
didn't make?

22:49.804 --> 22:57.211
Well, I think they should have gone forward and 
carried the $250 million, which would be good. No,

22:57.231 --> 23:00.374
I can't say that because I don't have the 
background. All right. Let's talk about that a

23:01.135 --> 23:02.536
minute. Coeducation. higher admission 
requirements, racial integration, broadening

23:05.840 --> 23:15.688
the curriculum, non-compulsory core, all those 
came in the 60s.

23:17.009 --> 23:19.471
Did those affect your effort? No. No, they helped 
my effort. You'd be surprised as to how many

23:23.655 --> 23:25.757
people. I always traveled with an 
engine-intensive car. That was my Roman

23:28.839 --> 23:31.582
billboard. And you'd be surprised at the number of 
people that stopped me and asked me questions or to

23:31.602 --> 23:35.745
give them information. I never took a trip that I 
didn't come back to that I didn't have four or five

23:36.130 --> 23:41.077
requests for information. And of course it was 
less like the U.S., you know. This girl was

23:46.706 --> 23:47.607
effective, you know. Everybody helped. The only 
ones that's hurting it is people who don't want to

23:50.031 --> 23:52.915
join the program. Now you rode to Austin for a 
number of years to reserve meetings with Earl

23:53.636 --> 24:01.007
Rudder. With Earl, I only went over there about six 
months with him because I'd always assigned a

24:01.493 --> 24:08.540
driver out of my unit to drive for him. And when I 
quit that, it's because the last three that I

24:08.560 --> 24:13.685
assigned as a driver, they got them in Westport. 
Oh, I see. I see. But I only filled in there for a

24:15.046 --> 24:19.370
period of about six months, I guess. So, all right. 
During those years that you and Mr. Rutter were

24:21.192 --> 24:31.382
going to the same meeting then in Austin,

24:21.192 --> 24:31.382
describe your relationship with him. in the 
reserve? Well, of course, Mr. Rudder was a major

24:34.938 --> 24:44.490
general and I was a colonel, and so rank-wise we was 
miles apart, and I respected him. I always

24:44.510 --> 24:48.655
addressed General Rudder as General Rudder. I 
never one time let myself down around General

24:48.675 --> 24:52.800
Rudder. I always was reasonably formal. We never 
did What he did was, he was going to his meeting on

24:58.733 --> 25:01.777
Monday night. And, you know, he'd have to be back. 
He'd be back by 11.30, 12 o'clock. Mr. Rutter, Mr.

25:07.125 --> 25:11.871
Rutter, normally on the way back, slept. And he had 
the ability to go to sleep.

25:17.178 --> 25:18.620
He said, well, what did y'all discuss?

25:21.544 --> 25:23.287
Well, we discussed the military quarter a bit. We 
discussed my view, and I had a better view. We

25:29.159 --> 25:35.447
discussed military personnel quite a bit.

25:35.467 --> 25:49.644
The university, the only thing that would come up 
about the university, you know, he'd ask you some

25:35.467 --> 25:49.644
questions that you really had no answer, and you'd 
say, well, let's just say I don't think he ever

25:35.467 --> 25:49.644
asked this question, but you just said these are 
the types of questions he'd ask. Well, has making

25:49.664 --> 25:58.255
the Corps adoptive of the persons coming to the 
university, has that had any effect on you? You

25:58.724 --> 26:00.767
know, I'd say, me personally? He'd say, well, 
personally and otherwise. I'd say, no, we're

26:03.992 --> 26:08.319
living in a different world.

26:08.339 --> 26:12.625
And, you know, I said, I wouldn't take all the money 
in the world for my years I spent in the Corps of

26:08.339 --> 26:12.625
Cadets. I said, but that was in 1940. And I said, 
I've got two sons. And I said, they're both in the

26:16.992 --> 26:19.696
Corps, but I guarantee you I didn't push them in the 
Corps. They went there on their own. But we never

26:23.001 --> 26:24.944
did get into personalities. We never did with me 
because, as I say, I was two ranks below him. I

26:28.373 --> 26:34.301
didn't have any relationship with him as him being 
my boss other than in the military. Can you share

26:34.622 --> 26:43.334
any anecdotes or amusing or interesting things 
that happened going to or from that involved Mr.

26:34.622 --> 26:43.334
Rutter? No, but did anything ever go wrong? Did you 
all ever have a flat or get there late or anything

26:46.358 --> 26:49.323
like that? Well, I got stopped several times for 
speeding. Oh, really? Oh, yeah. And what would the

26:53.489 --> 26:56.313
highway patrol say? He was taken. Oh, he gave you, 
it didn't matter whose car that was? We were

27:01.975 --> 27:03.517
driving a military vehicle. Mr. Runner liked to 
get where he was going fast. I don't know if

27:06.601 --> 27:08.403
anybody's ever told you that before. No, I didn't 
know that. Oh, yeah. He wasn't allergic to pushing

27:11.146 --> 27:15.792
the metal to the pedal. And I don't know how many 
tickets he got, but with me, I got one. All right,

27:21.118 --> 27:22.400
who paid the tickets? I gave it to him. Okay, so you 
don't know. You don't know, OK. I never did ask him.

27:29.708 --> 27:31.470
He always would take the ticket from me. He took the 
one ticket from me. All right, when the highway

27:32.531 --> 27:39.316
patrol would stop, did it impress the highway 
patrol that here was a major general? Well, that

27:40.037 --> 27:41.779
only happened one time with me. And I doubt if that 
highway patrol knew a major general. All right, so

27:44.121 --> 27:48.024
he didn't even talk to the person in the back seat. 
OK. I'm just talking about one time, late at night.

27:52.708 --> 27:52.928
Mr. Rudder, have a sense of humor? Very good sense 
of humor. Can you give me an example of his? I'll

28:00.802 --> 28:01.322
tell you. I had an infantry battle group, and we 
always had the Army command to come down when we

28:01.342 --> 28:06.928
were going to get canned. So Mr. Rutter always used 
my battle group as one to demonstrate and put on

28:06.948 --> 28:13.495
their submission. So one day, we was having this 
general come down, a 4th Army commander, General

28:13.515 --> 28:19.501
Russell. He said, Kim, I want to do this. Will you be 
out here training at 11 o'clock? Give me a map. Tell

28:23.225 --> 28:24.747
me specifically where you're going to be. All of 
these things. So I said, fine. I've done this a

28:27.862 --> 28:31.086
dozen times. So we decided to have an interview in a 
tank. And I picked out a beautiful valley, and I had

28:38.533 --> 28:44.279
a nice row of trees. And we come right, so I said, 
okay, we're going to come right down to our tanks.

28:50.846 --> 28:52.788
And so Bowman, Mr. Runner, and the other general go 
up. I went up here and reported to him. And Oh, he

28:56.722 --> 28:57.543
said, oh. And I said to this gentleman, I said, now 
there's a lot of wood rattlers here. And I said, in

29:03.469 --> 29:09.636
fact, I said, there's one right by your foot. He's a 
little bit shorter than me. And I said, put your

29:13.681 --> 29:16.203
boots on, then we'll talk. But anyway, we went up to 
this thing. By that time, boy, everything was, you

29:18.025 --> 29:22.951
know, I mean, I always had the time right there. 
They'd unload all the time they needed for attack,

29:24.192 --> 29:26.695
you know. So Mr. . But anyway, I told this 
gentleman, I said, sir, I said, there's another

29:28.991 --> 29:35.117
rattlesnake that crashed by your foot. And I just 
put my foot back in and stopped it. He said, didn't

29:38.861 --> 29:39.882
bite me, did he? I said, no, sir, he didn't bite you. 
So I got into his car. He said, now, are you sure that

29:42.784 --> 29:44.806
rattlesnake didn't bite you? I said, no, sir, he 
didn't bite you. Mr. Russell said, Jim, I'd like to

29:45.847 --> 29:47.969
see you at 1 o'clock today tomorrow. And I thought 
he was going to get me for telling him about the damn

29:50.191 --> 29:52.393
rattlesnake. He said, goddammit, Colonel. He 
said, when I said, made it realistic, he said, I

29:56.712 --> 30:04.239
didn't want you to run over us.

30:04.259 --> 30:05.560
I said, well, I said, at that slope. I said, you 
know, I said, to make it realistic, we had to come

30:05.660 --> 30:09.903
take part of that slope. He said, I didn't want it 
that damn close. As far as you know, when Earl

30:12.746 --> 30:21.754
Rudder was president of A&M, to whom did he turn for 
advice most often? Whose advice did he listen to

30:22.094 --> 30:25.437
most carefully? You mean from in-house?

30:40.000 --> 30:40.140
Mm-hmm. I don't know. I don't know. All right. Then 
you. It might surprise you, though, if you didn't

30:42.663 --> 30:44.104
know. It might be some instructor down there or 
something. You said in-house. All right, let's go

30:47.168 --> 30:48.429
out of the house. Away from the campus, whose 
advice did he hear? Well, he had here to the board's

30:51.052 --> 30:53.415
advice. He had a lot of respect for the board. 
Which, who were the key board members during his

30:56.246 --> 30:58.989
day? Well, let's see. He got out, when did he die, in 
59? Oh, in 70. In 69? Okay. He died in March of 70, is

31:09.640 --> 31:11.723
that it?

31:14.826 --> 31:19.171
Sterling Evans, Zachary, Clyde Wells. Clyde 
Wells was on it, and Mrs. Wilson from Lubbock was on

31:19.211 --> 31:23.115
it. And I don't know whether Norman Mosier was on it 
at that time. I don't either. And I don't know

31:31.046 --> 31:31.789
whether Mr.
