WEBVTT

00:01.680 --> 00:08.660
Full-time center managers, and they had their 
respective areas that they were out constantly

00:01.680 --> 00:08.660
seeing what we could do. Need study, learn need 
study topics. And then the divisions, so we

00:11.620 --> 00:16.440
wouldn't have any conflict with the divisions, 
they signed their staff to that center. And those

00:16.980 --> 00:20.540
staff didn't report it to any manager. The center 
manager had no administrative control over any of

00:20.640 --> 00:23.180
the people. Provided

00:25.870 --> 00:54.800
need

00:25.870 --> 00:54.800
studies,

00:25.870 --> 00:54.800
lots of good, and we had those available. When we 
started

00:54.920 --> 01:27.800
to offer the agency,

00:54.920 --> 01:27.800
the independent

00:54.920 --> 01:27.800
drillers

00:54.920 --> 01:27.800
came. So I said, well,

01:27.780 --> 01:39.180
here's

01:27.780 --> 01:39.180
what you're going to take. And I said, give us the, 
they underwrote the program.

01:58.290 --> 01:59.671
We believe you don't have anything. Looking

02:00.390 --> 02:43.540
back on those 19 years, is there any area of 
service, and I don't mean geographic area, but any

02:00.390 --> 02:43.540
topic, that you wish you all could have done more?

02:52.480 --> 02:56.820
Were you frustrated that you couldn't have served 
this or this or this industry?

03:01.220 --> 03:04.360
See, the Engineering Containment Service is the 
only agency in the state of Texas. They have a

03:04.460 --> 03:05.461
statewide mandate.

03:15.140 --> 03:20.340
And normally in all those cases, there's some 
trade association or something.

03:24.860 --> 03:27.580
What were your favorite groups to work with?

03:31.050 --> 03:33.670
There must have been some that were more pleasant 
than others, though. Who

03:33.810 --> 03:51.750
were the key state officials?

03:56.350 --> 03:57.751
I don't know if you can name your favorites. The 
ones that you would say thank you to. I guess the

04:03.450 --> 04:17.950
one, Joe

04:03.450 --> 04:17.950
Reynolds.

04:18.090 --> 04:21.170
See, Joe Reynolds and White was in the law 
practice. And White was his new mate. He was the

04:25.700 --> 04:39.630
Secretary of State, because I knew White when he 
was on the run for governor. I felt that he's the

04:39.610 --> 04:43.430
only governor I really, really knew. You know, for 
any, I've known all the governors, but I mean, you

04:43.410 --> 04:49.500
really know them. So I guess that's one reason I 
felt it close to him. You

04:52.280 --> 05:00.050
know, Preston helped me out an awful lot. Anytime I 
wanted to form him with any senator or

05:00.030 --> 05:05.370
representative, I could call him Bill, he'd hand 
it for me. This was while he was... State Chairman,

05:07.350 --> 05:12.510
was he, well, while he was a representative, and as 
he served, you know, he served his term as the state

05:07.350 --> 05:12.510
of Texas. The House Appropriation Committee for 
about 10 or 12 years. Whenever I wanted to form him

05:15.790 --> 05:23.060
with any senator or House of Representatives, I'd 
call him Bill, and he'd hand it for me. Of course,

05:23.040 --> 05:28.530
Bill Moore, he was in the Senate. I'd done a lot of 
other work for Bill Moore on his outside, and he had

05:28.510 --> 05:39.180
that back of A&M on him for charge, and that back of 
A&M was Bill, and he helped everybody out with

05:28.510 --> 05:39.180
that. Can you, can you give me an example of... 
lobbying at work, where you called somebody and

05:44.840 --> 05:49.860
they made the wheels turn? Give, take, describe. 
For a specific project? If you, if there was one.

05:58.340 --> 06:00.360
You can think of them. Yeah,

06:00.340 --> 06:20.430
a bunch

06:00.340 --> 06:20.430
of volunteer

06:00.340 --> 06:20.430
fire departments.

06:20.410 --> 07:00.820
It takes

06:20.410 --> 07:00.820
them to

06:20.410 --> 07:00.820
tie in with

06:20.410 --> 07:00.820
Harris

06:20.410 --> 07:00.820
County.

07:00.800 --> 07:05.730
It's a very expensive training program. You've 
got to have good training to be damn careful. And I

07:12.920 --> 07:15.940
said, it's true, the fuel's expensive, and you've 
got to burn. You can't just light a match and say,

07:15.920 --> 07:18.940
here, now we're gonna go put it out. I said, you've 
got to, if you're gonna have any fire training or

07:18.920 --> 07:24.540
those types of training, you've got to have 
hands-on training. They've got to smell the heat

07:24.520 --> 07:27.490
and see what's going on. But anyway, so, the way I 
stopped

07:27.470 --> 07:43.760
it, I went down to the organizer. What do you want?

07:50.680 --> 07:52.700
Give me an opportunity to say no. So

07:52.680 --> 08:00.480
finally, what there'd be a big gripe was, there's a 
volunteer fire department, and they didn't have

07:52.680 --> 08:00.480
anybody to place the train on site. They'd open the 
damn fire key on Saturday morning. And that was

08:02.460 --> 08:04.790
their big gripe. You know, they worked five days a 
week, and they didn't have any place to come on in.

08:09.880 --> 08:10.901
It was too expensive. They didn't have any lights 
and so forth. What time do you want it? You want to

08:15.670 --> 08:17.690
open it at ten on Saturday? Burn it till six. They 
would kill that one. But another, at the same time,

08:22.000 --> 08:26.660
they were trying to get one out the rest of the time. 
And the word got to them then what we did. But then

08:28.640 --> 08:30.660
they used the excuse that we live too far away. We 
can't come that distance. Alright, can you give an

08:35.440 --> 08:39.460
example of where you needed some help in the 
legislature? You needed to get a bill passed or

08:39.440 --> 08:43.460
some funding, and give me an example of where some 
people stepped up to help the extension service.

08:49.690 --> 08:51.710
No, I'll request for state appropriated money. 
The only state appropriated money, the way I used

08:51.690 --> 08:54.710
my state appropriated money was for the volunteer 
fire departments and the growing million

08:54.690 --> 09:02.120
dollars. They didn't support our programs.

09:13.760 --> 09:42.490
I presented

09:13.760 --> 09:42.490
my bill,

09:13.760 --> 09:42.490
but I had programs

09:13.760 --> 09:42.490
that

09:13.760 --> 09:42.490
we had a $39 million.

09:42.470 --> 09:45.640
We didn't have any in-house fights with the board 
or other agencies. In fact, I had, on numerous

09:45.620 --> 09:49.340
occasions, extension service to get their money 
the way I got mine. And John Dutch said one time, the

09:51.320 --> 10:03.060
chancellor

09:51.320 --> 10:03.060
of the system, I guess he was about to answer that, 
by the way, he had them all, and his main complaint

10:05.040 --> 10:12.630
was he had a different clientele. You know, my 
comeback would tell me a poor group of volunteers.

10:19.300 --> 10:24.320
Alright, now, you reported to Benson and Calhoun 
under Dr. Williams when you were first. Alright,

10:27.300 --> 10:31.700
Dr. Williams has the heart attack, and then the 
system is recreated, the chancellor of the system

10:35.680 --> 10:37.700
recreated in 76, and Jarvis Miller becomes 
president. Now, Ludeke went in and served for

10:41.680 --> 10:44.700
Williams. Right, right. And tell them about 
working with General Ludeke. I

10:49.680 --> 10:58.060
said, yes, sir, and I knew it, but I didn't argue 
with him. How long did it take him to make up his mind

10:58.040 --> 11:02.060
about something? Well, when they told me I was 
going to move, that they were going to move the

11:05.200 --> 11:06.221
headquarters, my friend told me, now, this is 
temporary. And Dr. Williams told me, they've all

11:13.720 --> 11:17.200
agreed with me that we have this eyesore for the 
university. Now,

11:20.200 --> 11:26.310
this is from that, down at the south. So, Ludeke was 
in the community. When I went down there

11:28.920 --> 11:42.420
to see them, they had my reproduction shop. I 
always had my own reproduction shop. I admit, it

11:48.840 --> 11:50.860
was probably the only one. Industrial economics, 
I had my own reproduction facility. So, I could

11:52.840 --> 11:54.920
control the time. I could move my projects around 
any way I wanted to. So, I had to deliver them. But I

11:59.280 --> 12:01.300
had a reproduction shop from day one. And a lot of 
people made it. Now, this was for printing? Yeah.

12:05.545 --> 12:06.300
Materials? Yes. Artistic work? Yeah. Because all 
of mine was sponsored research. And, you know,

12:11.360 --> 12:14.270
when I brought down there, and I had Exxon, I had 
contracts for Exxon for seven or eight straight

12:16.250 --> 12:18.270
years. And you made it to their board. Well, they 
expected a First Quest presentation. They didn't

12:22.250 --> 12:25.270
want to see some carbon paper stuck out. That was 
quality. And that was built into the price. But

12:29.360 --> 12:35.160
anyway, when I went down to see them, there was 
stuff coming up and down.

12:46.990 --> 12:49.010
Of course, I'd gone into really, you know, 
developing good lesson plans, good technical

12:48.990 --> 12:52.010
management. And we had part of a reproduction shop 
still do that. They built that building out. And by

12:57.520 --> 12:59.540
the way, you know, we even paid for our building. We 
built that $250,000 building out at the annex. We

13:03.800 --> 13:06.910
built that $500,000 Fred Benson up. He put 
$500,000 into it. We built that bomb building. We

13:12.890 --> 13:13.911
built that. Hazardous materials. I built that out 
of my feed, you know. I asked them whether it was

13:17.890 --> 13:22.630
right or wrong. I operated the engineering 
facility. I did the extension services. I charged

13:25.610 --> 13:27.630
for everything. There was no free things. I mean, 
it was all built into the price. So, we were able to

13:33.390 --> 13:36.810
do this kind of thing. But anyway, we got that. So, 
Jim and Luke, he said, Well, I don't know the thing

13:38.790 --> 13:40.810
about reproduction. I said, Well, let's put it 
down on the first floor so people can get in and get

13:42.790 --> 13:44.810
out. And we moved that down. Well, that caused... 
Who had that before? Who had that? Whoever had that

13:50.480 --> 13:52.500
shop was going to do it. People were going to do it. 
And Jim and Luke got on the phone and said, Make

13:55.480 --> 13:57.500
those things. Right from his office. Who was that 
guy that had that? I don't remember. All right.

14:05.603 --> 14:17.300
Then when

14:05.603 --> 14:17.300
General Ludeke

14:05.603 --> 14:17.300
steps aside, then,

14:17.280 --> 14:26.510
let's see, Jarvis is president and Dr. Williams is 
here for another couple of years. How did your

14:29.490 --> 14:33.510
reporting process change then? To whom did you 
report? Well,

14:35.490 --> 14:56.500
they made Pinson

14:35.490 --> 14:56.500
vice president.

14:56.480 --> 14:59.500
But now, you know, I'd give them a continuing 
education after five years. You know, I only took

15:00.480 --> 15:02.500
that job for five years. I was out of continuing 
education. And that fifth year come up just about

15:05.790 --> 15:11.400
the time Jarvis took over. Right. So, you then, by 
and large, reported to the system, not through the

15:17.660 --> 15:20.930
president's office. Well, I can't say that 
because I had to make a budget presentation one

15:22.910 --> 15:25.270
year ago. Okay. All right. So, what was the first 
meeting of his key people? Did you meet with them?

15:30.250 --> 15:31.930
All right. Did... No, the agencies did. All right. 
Did Dr. Williams, did he, when he gathered the

15:34.166 --> 15:36.740
agencies, you met with them when he was 
chancellor? Well, one or two meetings we had, yes.

15:44.280 --> 15:44.906
All right. Then when he left, Frank Hubert became 
the chancellor. What,

15:48.280 --> 15:54.860
did the routine change at all? The

15:54.840 --> 16:08.210
first thing, he told me the first thing he

15:54.840 --> 16:08.210
liked, I mean, Fred and Dean Hubert. All right. 
Then take me on up through the 80s. Were there any

16:17.410 --> 16:22.320
changes in the routine with different presidents 
and different chancellors? Well, of course,

16:24.300 --> 16:26.730
Richardson took over. Wait,

16:26.710 --> 16:33.870
we skipped the man from Purdue. No, Hanson. 
Hanson. He was chancellor. Well, it was about 84.

16:38.830 --> 16:44.460
Oh, and Richardson became

16:38.830 --> 16:44.460
dean of engineering? Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah. Yeah. He 
became dean of engineering. All right. He was

16:51.636 --> 16:52.020
also... Describe

16:52.000 --> 16:56.510
his management style. Comment.

17:02.497 --> 17:03.240
Was it... It was less direct than Benson and 
Calhoun had been. Herb never... I can't say enough

17:10.884 --> 17:29.970
because

17:10.884 --> 17:29.970
Herb

17:10.884 --> 17:29.970
objected to a thing I wanted to do. He proved 
everything. I sat down and I met with him once a

17:30.950 --> 17:34.470
month. Where

17:34.450 --> 17:51.040
Herb's problems was caused by his dad, Jack 
Flipsey.

17:51.020 --> 17:53.040
And we only had one conflict. Now, you've got to 
realize I'm a very organized person. I believe in

17:59.280 --> 18:01.420
an organizational chart. I believe it and I follow 
it. But anyway, you want me to put this on tape? Let

18:03.400 --> 18:04.421
me cut it off. Let me just talk a little bit.

18:08.740 --> 18:09.761
During that 19-year period? Of

18:09.740 --> 18:13.912
course. I'd have to say Dr. Liggett was in place 
number one. I'd have to say Dr. Liggett was in place

18:14.960 --> 18:18.250
number two.

18:22.230 --> 18:23.251
You got to do this on the video. positive, to which 
ones would you give the highest, as many as you want

18:24.230 --> 18:28.250
to, which ones deserve the highest credit? During

18:29.230 --> 18:35.600
that 19-year period? Of course. I'd

18:36.342 --> 18:45.370
have to say Dr. Liggett was in place number one. 
Why? Well, I just think he was more knowledgeable

18:47.018 --> 18:51.280
about the types of programs that the engineering 
detention centers were using. I think that he

18:52.600 --> 18:55.710
accepted them on their merit, not in his second 
class. He never did give me the truant of giving

18:55.690 --> 18:58.810
them the truant, but he says that that's He was

19:00.110 --> 19:14.600
very easy to talk to.

19:14.580 --> 19:15.067
Who else? Well, of course, Mr. Benson. I'm taking 
him from the top down now. Until he got Tony

19:19.670 --> 19:37.810
retired, we had a

19:19.670 --> 19:37.810
good relationship after he

19:19.670 --> 19:37.810
retired. Fred was always to the point, which I 
like. Fred had a lot of character. at 730. He'd

19:42.909 --> 19:44.500
stand around on the porch waiting for you at 730. 
He'd always ask me that question. Is there an area

19:47.600 --> 19:48.621
you want me to comment on? I think Fred was a very 
smart guy. He was a very good guy. He was a very good

19:52.070 --> 19:53.091
guy. He was a very good guy. He was a very good guy. He 
was a very good guy. He was a very good guy. He was a

19:57.070 --> 19:58.091
very good guy. He was a very good guy. I think Fred 
was a very smart individual. A lot of people

20:02.070 --> 20:03.091
listened. And I admired that in him. So,

20:04.070 --> 20:23.610
I'd have to put him on top, and then the next man was 
Calhoun. I was told to talk to Calhoun. He had a lot

20:26.000 --> 20:27.430
of good ideas. working in relationships 
together.

20:34.004 --> 20:44.227
In my opinion, I'm not saying one was better than 
the other, but in my opinion, we had a completely

20:34.004 --> 20:44.227
different type of leadership after the middle 
80s. It was completely different. Did it become

20:45.770 --> 20:48.961
more bureaucratic? Yes, it was strictly 
bureaucratic. You didn't feel at ease, you didn't

20:51.991 --> 20:54.880
feel at ease picking up the phone and calling. I 
never did it in the first place, but I always knew

20:54.860 --> 21:01.697
that I could if I wanted to talk to Dr. Calhoun. I 
didn't have to worry about Dr. Williams or Calhoun

21:01.717 --> 21:07.090
chewing me out for calling Dr. Williams or vice 
versa. Mr. Benson, I mean, I didn't ever do it to my

21:07.070 --> 21:14.891
knowledge, but I always felt comfortable in doing 
such a thing like that. We were more, in my opinion,

21:14.911 --> 21:18.120
we were more professional. We respected each 
other more. We had a great deal of respect for each

21:20.955 --> 21:25.520
other, and I think that was probably the warning 
greetings. It made those change in us, taking

21:25.500 --> 21:35.695
forward to the time I

21:25.500 --> 21:35.695
retired in 92. We had a closeness, I think. I felt to 
him as my friend, and not only as my boss, but my

21:39.801 --> 21:45.670
friend. Now, other than your senior partners, 
whom did you turn to for advice and counsel and

21:45.650 --> 21:56.670
input most often? To my committees. To my 
committees. We had advisory committees in every

21:58.650 --> 22:04.670
sector of my Engineering Detention Service 
program, made up of the leaders in their field.

22:04.650 --> 22:09.160
Like the telephone association, I'd have top 
telephone members. Power company, I'd have

22:09.180 --> 22:10.670
somebody from the power company. And we had 
advisory committees. We had one whole law

22:14.067 --> 22:16.640
advisory committee for the Engineering 
Detention Service. We had one meeting a year, and

22:16.620 --> 22:20.760
I'd call it in various parts of the state. But other 
committee members would, you know, just pick up

22:20.740 --> 22:25.240
the phone and ask. I

22:25.220 --> 22:29.225
kept them informed. If it was on my telephone 
committee, you got it. And I didn't delude them or

22:31.740 --> 22:34.760
anything, but the things they ought to see, I sent 
it to them. That's who I got help from, my users. As

22:38.020 --> 22:46.220
you look back, can you think of any decisions you 
wish that Texas A&M had made that it didn't make? I

22:46.200 --> 22:53.061
think they should have gone for co-education. I 
can't say that because I don't have the

22:53.081 --> 22:59.080
background. All right. Let's talk about that a 
minute. Co-education, higher admission

23:03.058 --> 23:08.080
requirements, racial integration, broadening 
the curriculum, non-compulsory core, all those

23:08.060 --> 23:16.080
came in the 60s. Did those affect your effort? No. 
You'd be surprised, I always traveled with an

23:21.745 --> 23:32.780
internship, and you'd be surprised at the number. 
I never took a trip that I didn't. The only one

23:38.031 --> 23:51.220
that's hurting it is people

23:38.031 --> 23:51.220
who don't. Now, you rode to Austin for a number of 
years to reserve meetings with Earl Rudder. Well,

24:00.390 --> 24:03.588
yes. And I always assigned a driver out of my unit to 
drive for him. Oh. And when I quit that, it's

24:08.576 --> 24:13.670
because the last three that I assigned as drivers, 
they got them in Westport. Oh, I see. I see. But I

24:14.650 --> 24:19.450
only filled in there for a period of about... So, 
all right. During those years that you and Mr.

24:24.551 --> 24:29.050
Rudder were going to the same meeting then in 
Austin, describe your relationship with him and

24:29.030 --> 24:33.050
the reserve. For one time,

24:33.030 --> 24:50.600
I let

24:33.030 --> 24:50.600
myself down. You were

24:50.580 --> 25:01.740
going

24:50.580 --> 25:01.740
to his meeting on Monday night. You know, he'd have 
to be back. We'd be back by Mr. Rudder. Mr. Rudder

25:07.165 --> 25:09.800
nominated me on the way back to Atlanta. He had the 
ability to do that. He

25:13.150 --> 25:18.650
said, well, what did y'all discuss? Well,

25:18.630 --> 25:29.190
we discussed the military, quite a bit.

25:29.170 --> 25:31.190
We discussed military personnel, quite a bit. The

25:31.170 --> 25:39.760
university, the only thing that would come up 
about the university, you know, he'd ask you some

25:39.740 --> 25:42.760
questions that you really had no answer. And you'd 
say, well, let's just say I don't think he ever

25:42.740 --> 25:45.760
asked this question. He'd just say, these are the 
type of questions he'd ask. Well, has... Well, has

25:47.740 --> 25:56.740
making the Corps adoptive of the persons coming to 
the university, has that had any effect on you? You

25:59.030 --> 26:01.050
know, I'd say, me personally? He'd say, well, 
personally, not a lot. I'd say, no. We're living in

26:04.030 --> 26:08.250
a different world. You know, I said, I wouldn't 
take all the money in the world for my years I spent

26:08.230 --> 26:12.250
in the Corps of Cadets. I said, but that was in 1940. 
And I said, I've got two sons. And I said, they're

26:16.830 --> 26:17.851
both in the Corps. But I guarantee you, I didn't 
push them into the Corps. They went there on their

26:19.830 --> 26:20.851
own. There you go. But we never did get into 
personalities. We never did with me because, as I

26:25.020 --> 26:29.040
say, I was two ranks below him. I didn't have any 
relationship with him as him being my boss other

26:29.020 --> 26:34.040
than in the military. Can you share any anecdotes 
or amusing or interesting things that happened

26:34.020 --> 26:44.040
going to or from that involved Mr. Rutter? No, but 
did anything ever go wrong? Did you all ever have a

26:46.020 --> 26:49.040
flat or get there late or anything like that? Well, 
I got stopped several times for speeding. Oh,

26:51.020 --> 26:52.142
really? Oh, yeah. And what would the highway 
patrol say? Give us a ticket. Oh, he gave you. It

26:58.020 --> 27:01.040
didn't matter whose car that was? We were driving a 
military vehicle. Mr. Rutter liked to get where he

27:03.020 --> 27:06.120
was going fast. I don't know if anybody's ever told 
you that before. No, I didn't know that. Well, he

27:09.100 --> 27:14.600
wasn't allergic to pushing the metal to the pedal. 
I don't know how many tickets he got, but with me, I

27:14.580 --> 27:20.150
don't know. All right, who paid the tickets? Okay, 
so you don't know. I don't know. You don't know.

27:28.100 --> 27:28.692
Okay. I never did ask him. He always would take the 
ticket from me. All right. He took the one ticket

27:31.833 --> 27:33.180
from me. All right. When the highway patrol would 
stop, did it impress the highway patrol that here

27:33.583 --> 27:39.240
was a major general? Well, that only happened one 
time with me. Oh, okay. And I doubt if that highway

27:41.848 --> 27:44.240
patrol knew a major general. All right, so he 
didn't even talk to the person in the back seat.

27:47.220 --> 27:48.355
Okay. I'm just talking about one time. It was late 
at night. Mr. Rutter had a sense of humor? Can you

27:53.560 --> 27:58.360
give me any examples? I told you, I had an infantry 
battalion. okay, we're going to come right down to

28:00.340 --> 28:01.601
our tanks. Mr. Rutter makes

28:01.580 --> 28:38.880
the other general

28:01.580 --> 28:38.880
go

28:01.580 --> 28:38.880
up.

28:38.860 --> 28:39.881
I went up to this gentleman. I said, now, there's a 
lot of wood rattlers here. And I said, in fact, I

28:42.740 --> 28:44.720
said, there's one right by your foot. He's a little 
bit sharp there. Put your boots on. They won't

28:46.700 --> 28:47.721
bother you. But anyway, we went up to this thing. I 
mean, I had an infantry battalion. I had an

29:00.120 --> 29:01.141
infantry battalion. I had an infantry battalion. 
I had an infantry battalion. I had an infantry

29:03.370 --> 29:04.391
battalion. I had an infantry battalion.

29:20.670 --> 29:21.691
I had an infantry battalion. I had an infantry 
battalion. They were all down there. I always had

29:23.670 --> 29:24.691
the time to write to America. Zoom! Zoom! Zoom! And 
I had a little awful time with them. So, Mr. Rutter

29:29.210 --> 29:30.231
had to go up and I was there. your foot. And I just put 
my foot back there and stopped playing. He said,

29:33.210 --> 29:34.231
get him back. You did it. I said, I'll show you. He 
said, I'd like to see you at one o'clock today,

29:41.670 --> 29:47.160
tomorrow. And

29:47.140 --> 29:52.980
I thought he was going to get me for telling him 
about the damn rattler thing. He said, what, damn

29:52.960 --> 29:56.050
it, Curl? He said, when I said, made it realistic, 
he said, I didn't want you to run over us.

30:03.970 --> 30:09.110
I said, well, I said, at that slope, I said, you 
know, I said, to make it realistic, we had to come

30:03.970 --> 30:09.110
take part of that slope. He said, I didn't want that 
there, Curl. As far as you know, when Earl Rudder

30:12.470 --> 30:21.720
was president of A&M, to whom did he turn for advice 
most often? To whom, whose advice did he listen to

30:21.700 --> 30:25.200
most carefully?

30:29.060 --> 30:30.329
In-house? Mm-hmm.

30:40.480 --> 30:41.013
All right. Then you? It might surprise you, 
though, if you didn't know. It might be some

30:44.140 --> 30:46.220
instructor down there or something. You said 
in-house. All right, let's go out of the house.

30:48.900 --> 30:51.320
Away from the campus, whose advice did he hear 
most? Well, he had ear to the board's advice. He had

30:54.650 --> 30:56.091
a lot of respect for the board. Which, who were the 
key board members during his day?

31:05.130 --> 31:07.090
Oh, in 70. In 69.

31:14.700 --> 31:16.400
Sterling Evans, Zachary. Clyde Wells. Clyde 
Wells was on it, and Mrs. Wilson from Lubbock was on

31:19.233 --> 31:22.470
it.
