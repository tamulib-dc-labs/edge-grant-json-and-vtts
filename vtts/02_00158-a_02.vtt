WEBVTT

00:03.035 --> 00:09.102
So our lodging was taken care of. Of course, we had 
to provide our food. We didn't expect them to feed

00:10.944 --> 00:17.812
us in the village. So we'd done this tour. Were you 
in a bus? Yes, we would rent a bus. I don't know if

00:24.460 --> 00:30.527
rent is a good word or not, because they'd furnish 
the driver.

00:32.870 --> 00:39.140
We'd get through play in one place and maybe we 
could stay all night and drive all the next day to

00:32.870 --> 00:39.140
the next one. But we tried to book it so that we 
wouldn't have too much mileage to make in a short

00:39.160 --> 00:47.873
period of time. And these were dances for the town 
people, for anybody that wanted to come? Yes, I

00:57.728 --> 00:59.170
would suppose so. Because generally, you know, 
you wouldn't have too many Aggies in one town. West

01:04.778 --> 01:09.485
Texas is well known for its Aggie information. And 
I'm sure they invite people from the next town

01:09.505 --> 01:14.753
club, you know, or whatever. Because they're 
usually well attended. So you would have, you

01:19.440 --> 01:22.825
didn't take a piano from here? No. So they would 
provide the piano, and you'd have to get

01:23.680 --> 01:30.387
accustomed to a new piano every night.

01:33.650 --> 01:38.776
Do you remember any particular difficulties you 
had? Well, I can with Buzzy, but not necessarily.

01:42.800 --> 01:44.742
Well, give an example with Buzzy. Well, one place 
in South Texas where we booked a band was The piano

01:50.782 --> 01:55.466
was so bad and so out of tune, I just sat there all 
night. All I would contribute would be a discord. I

02:02.212 --> 02:09.018
was the worst piano I ever saw, although I was 
singing some pretty bad ones. What was, in that

02:09.038 --> 02:17.146
first year or so, what were the favorite songs that 
the Aggieland Orchestra played? Well,

02:18.066 --> 02:19.928
Chattanooga Choo Choo and There

02:20.718 --> 02:38.654
were some instrumentals that he played that I 
don't recall quite the names of, but some of the big

02:20.718 --> 02:38.654
bands had some instrumentals to show off their 
talent. He emulated some of those. Did you all have

02:41.697 --> 02:42.918
a vocalist? Well, not Percy. There was a young lady 
here in town. Alice Butler. Alice what? Butler.

02:56.798 --> 03:00.482
She was Bob Butler's wife. They were a big 
construction company. But she had a good velocity

03:03.506 --> 03:08.012
and she used to sing with us occasionally. But she 
didn't travel with you? No, she didn't. So mostly

03:10.615 --> 03:13.118
it was instrumental.

03:15.207 --> 03:19.772
And of course, that was the going thing, you know, 
instrumental music. Some of the bands, as you

03:20.232 --> 03:25.057
know, had very fine vocals. They were big bands. 
Now, all of the members of the Aggieland Orchestra

03:28.461 --> 03:32.826
were students. Yes. And did y'all ever have any 
problem of being out on the road and not be able to

03:34.848 --> 03:40.894
get back to classes? No, we didn't. I think we were 
very careful about that. Because most of the

03:46.466 --> 03:53.796
dances were held either on Friday or Saturday 
night. So you had all day Sunday to get back if you

03:53.816 --> 03:59.543
needed to be in class on Monday morning. All right, 
let's go back to classes. How did you, as a young

04:02.867 --> 04:10.577
28-year-old freshman, what was it like to start 
college At that age? Well, I'll give you

04:13.078 --> 04:15.300
something. I went to a Yale practice. I'm not over 
there. I'm not a speaker, but that YMCA thing.

04:24.291 --> 04:26.674
Everybody's down on those steps, you know, and 
everything. And they, you know, at the end of the

04:27.535 --> 04:38.168
thing, that freshman had to take off and run, and 
you're familiar with that, don't you? And so the

04:38.755 --> 04:42.401
band leader now was sitting up there, and he said, 
now don't you run. So I didn't, man. But everybody

04:46.307 --> 04:50.013
thought I was about a junior transfer. I wasn't my 
age. So they didn't pick on you? No. What classes do

04:56.764 --> 04:59.448
you remember that first year? What courses? Well, 
mostly the baseball. I excelled in English. You

05:08.861 --> 05:13.207
know, I had the advantage of all the history and 
things and everything like that. English, I mean,

05:13.227 --> 05:20.315
I had some, you know, what was it, I think it was 
history. But mostly it was the basics. Who taught,

05:21.817 --> 05:24.020
do you remember who taught your history class? 
Well, I, yeah. Why did you say that guy's name?

05:29.947 --> 05:30.448
Nance. Yeah, one of them. But I think I got him in one 
of the higher grades. What about, was it Ralph

05:33.832 --> 05:35.454
Steen? Yeah. Yeah. And I don't know who else. Let's 
see. Let me think about some of those other

05:40.771 --> 05:49.539
guys. I was good in English. I had an advantage 
growing up. I was reading and that sort of thing. I

06:00.649 --> 06:03.332
got good grades in those courses. What about math? 
I had algebra. pain in the neck. If I had had

06:09.162 --> 06:17.896
advanced algebra, I had jumped in high school and 
it was a breeze for me. But trigonometry I had to

06:17.916 --> 06:21.541
skip on. I think you had to take algebra at that 
time. And then a literature, I don't know if it was

06:28.412 --> 06:34.521
English literature or That was a summer draft. And 
it managed to give me 150 pages to read by the next

06:38.644 --> 06:43.530
day.

06:48.696 --> 06:50.959
Did you go home that first year? Did you go home to 
visit? Yes, I did. But you're hitchhiking home

06:54.484 --> 06:58.228
most of the time, you know. You leave on Friday 
afternoon. Maybe you should be on the road at

06:59.890 --> 07:02.854
midnight. Describe your memories of 
hitchhiking. Where did you go to catch the ride? We

07:08.989 --> 07:18.961
used to line up over at A&M over in Bryan, I think, on 
Texas Avenue, right about the business center

07:08.989 --> 07:18.961
down there. Over on, well, then it was not called 
Texas, it was called something else, I don't know

07:18.981 --> 07:24.148
why. And you'd go and put your bag down in the place 
and line up, and when your time came to catch a ride.

07:29.314 --> 07:31.457
And everybody, you know, The public knew about the 
agonist attack. So you'd get a ride with me.

07:38.145 --> 07:41.448
Sometimes you'd get dropped off at the wrong 
place. Did that ever happen to you? Oh, yeah. Where

07:44.051 --> 07:45.292
did you get dropped off? So I got dropped off just 
out of Waco in a little small town down there. And I

07:49.897 --> 07:54.781
think I stood there an hour before I finally got a 
ride. Generally speaking, you'd get your ride

07:54.801 --> 07:59.486
pretty quick. And my roommate lived there. That 
first year it lived in Longview or Gladewater, in

08:02.099 --> 08:08.346
Gladewater. The woman asked me to go home with her. 
We got out and we caught a ride. It was about 5 or 6

08:14.012 --> 08:17.716
o'clock that afternoon. One of our rides, we had to 
ride in a turtle, you know one of them. And the wind

08:23.482 --> 08:27.246
was blowing strong and we were just about to blow 
out of that thing. Finally, somewhere up in East

08:28.390 --> 08:33.595
Texas, we saw the ride that took us all the way to 
Gladewater. And we got there about midnight.

08:38.779 --> 08:42.283
Did you ever have any bad hitchhiking experience? 
No, not really. Pretty much, you know, people know

08:45.325 --> 08:48.388
you about baggage. And I don't know why they made 
special provisions. So at that time, we were

08:53.473 --> 08:56.115
lucky. This is where we're going. alright so did 
you go home thanksgiving or Christmas your first

08:59.221 --> 09:28.570
year I'll be there you know you yeah it wasn't too 
much and

08:59.221 --> 09:28.570
who are some teachers that you remember from that 
first year so that we're really special well

08:59.221 --> 09:28.570
remember You mentioned one of them, Screaming Al. 
Screaming Al Nelson in history? Yeah. I had him one

09:34.043 --> 09:35.125
time. He taught me a lot. Did you know him? Yes, sir. 
And then the English teacher, Powell. Powell?

09:45.541 --> 09:45.882
Uh-huh. P-O-W-E-L-L. He was quite an older man. 
His eyesight wasn't too good. But I turned in a

09:54.908 --> 10:05.059
paper to him one time, I don't know what it was, 
something written in class, which he gave me

09:54.908 --> 10:05.059
astounding numbers of hundreds. But like I said, I 
had the advantage, almost impressionable, you

10:05.079 --> 10:16.872
know, of 12 years of reading and writing and 
writing.

10:17.472 --> 10:22.958
And did the other students sometimes turn to you 
for advice since you were older than they were? No,

10:23.697 --> 10:25.680
I never really had any of that. I know one time, 
though, when I first came down here, and my

10:26.021 --> 10:36.557
roommate's name was Guggles. And so when his 
parents got his first, you know, grades, his

10:36.577 --> 10:46.212
mother came down. He said, I'm going to bring him 
over to Jesus. And you see that he does his

10:52.203 --> 10:54.426
classwork. Of course, I had all I could do. And he 
said, and be sure that he does what he's supposed to

10:57.229 --> 11:00.993
do. And I can remember when I told her, you're going 
to need to put this down. So if he doesn't do right,

11:06.078 --> 11:11.524
I'll just stick the hell out of it. Did they ever try 
to haze you, the sophomores or juniors? No, I never

11:15.629 --> 11:16.890
had any of that. because of my age, you know, and I'm 
just, I don't know what, they never, I was never

11:17.478 --> 11:26.091
hazed. Did you eat at that, at the boarding house 
where you lived? Yes, I did. In fact, not only ate

11:31.219 --> 11:37.588
there, but behind that house they had a garden 
plot. It was, I don't know how much it was, but it was

11:38.770 --> 11:45.460
a pretty good sized plot back then. farming 
experience, I planted some green beans back then.

11:50.403 --> 11:52.126
Real green beans today. I never thought that the 
crops would exist before. They just kept varying

11:56.613 --> 12:01.481
and we ate green beans over here. Now how did you get 
to the campus each day? How did you get back and

12:07.390 --> 12:09.794
forth to the campus? Well, like I said, this one guy 
had a truck. We used to ride out there. I don't know

12:15.241 --> 12:24.415
whether he went back and forth at different times, 
but I do recall having ridden in that truck from

12:15.241 --> 12:24.415
time to time. And otherwise, we had people that 
would pick you up and take you to school. And I don't

12:29.282 --> 12:33.529
recall ever having missed a class because of being 
tardy or anything. And did you spend the whole day

12:34.390 --> 12:39.237
on the campus sometimes? If I haven't had more than 
one class, then yes. now where did you go if you had

12:43.608 --> 12:52.977
any spare time during the day where did you go on 
campus to study or to relax? mostly probably to

12:53.838 --> 13:00.324
relax and I might have hushed up on my piano where 
would you do that? well they had a piano in that

13:00.625 --> 13:08.973
church type thing oh in the old chapel? yeah they 
had a good piano there and they also had a good piano

13:09.273 --> 13:13.277
in the in the YMCA there. Did you meet Mr. Cashin? 
Oh, yes. Please describe him. Well, he was head of

13:22.661 --> 13:25.684
the YMCA there. Son Red was a kid then, about five or 
so. We used to see a lot of Reds around the YMCA. And I

13:34.173 --> 13:39.619
never had very much relationship with Mr. Cashin. 
He was pretty busy with his stuff, I guess. But it

13:46.615 --> 13:48.657
was okay for you to play on that piano? Oh, yes, sir. 
Did you go to the library much? Yes, I did. Quite a

13:53.222 --> 13:54.504
bit. Of course, it was much smaller than it is now. 
But I can't remember any researching I did there or

13:58.268 --> 14:03.835
anything like that. But I've understood from 
freshmen in the Corps that the library was a place

14:04.810 --> 14:12.380
where you could go and escape the sophomores. 
Well, since I didn't classify, really, as a

14:13.942 --> 14:20.531
freshman, I didn't have to do that. Where did you go 
to get something to eat or a cold drink? Well, you

14:26.319 --> 14:27.460
know, they had this. thing down in the basement at 
the YMCA. I've forgotten the name of it. It's been

14:33.779 --> 14:34.800
there for years and years and years. You just go 
down there and you get Coca-Cola and things like

14:34.820 --> 14:43.148
that. Would you eat lunch on campus? Sometimes I 
would. Where? At Sabeza. I believe at that time you

14:50.635 --> 14:55.460
paid as you went in. I'm thinking that Do

14:57.713 --> 15:09.963
you remember what that first year or any of your 
years cost? What the tuition and fees were? And

15:12.606 --> 15:25.456
you made all of your, you supported yourself. Your 
parents didn't send you any money. Right. But the

15:28.207 --> 15:34.776
band was better paid than most of the other 
students or, you know, other people. So I can't

15:36.018 --> 15:41.445
remember whether I got $5 a day or that thing at $5 an 
hour. It was probably more like $5 a day. And on

15:46.031 --> 15:56.785
those trips, at Christmas time, you know, it kind 
of built up a capital fund, you know, and it got me

15:46.031 --> 15:56.785
over into it. So you mean you're... had a little bit 
of leftover. Did y'all ever get stranded by?

16:05.262 --> 16:05.523
Back? No, I don't remember ever being. I can 
remember. Me and two other guys got stranded down

16:10.770 --> 16:13.614
in Dallas. And we were supposed to be back on campus 
in the morning for classes, you know. And we got

16:21.245 --> 16:22.506
stranded. Stranded is. I'm telling you, we got 
stranded down between here and, let's see, what's

16:23.988 --> 16:30.875
that? Not in Avisota. Hempstead. Hempstead. 
Between Hempstead and Avisota. We got really

16:37.523 --> 16:39.505
stranded. We didn't get home until daylight. Oh, 
boy. Now, when you went to class, since you weren't

16:43.269 --> 16:47.273
in uniform, what did you wear? Standard pants. 
Well, but was it a... Well, probably jeans and a

16:49.865 --> 17:00.335
shirt, you know, and a jacket, and work shoes. But I 
must have stood out like a sore thumb, you know, in

17:00.355 --> 17:08.103
some of those classes. In class, what was the 
normal kind of behavior? How did you all behave in

17:12.808 --> 17:16.952
class? extended the class. There was no hot shots 
and yak yak death. Those classes were, what you can

17:22.824 --> 17:34.020
understand, I'm sure, that since it was a military 
school, most of the students were military

17:22.824 --> 17:34.020
students and they knew what to expect of them. Did 
you all go every day? No, we didn't have classes

17:35.122 --> 17:38.267
every day. No, but I mean, did you go to every time 
the class met or did you cut class very often? No, we

17:43.955 --> 17:46.078
never cut classes. As that first year ended, how 
were your grades? Well, I just barely made it from

17:53.167 --> 17:55.831
the six-week thing. I hadn't gotten a D in 
trigonometry or algebra or something like that

17:57.153 --> 18:03.282
that had sent me back home. That was your first 
year? Yeah. I barely made it under the wire to stay

18:08.128 --> 18:13.336
that second semester. I'll be right back. 
evaluated six weeks I think that's what it was and

18:16.754 --> 18:44.550
then if you didn't make it in six weeks you were 
shipped out they didn't have no room for you if you

18:16.754 --> 18:44.550
couldn't make you know the grades but I was lucky 
and I mean I was fortunate to be able to stay that

18:16.754 --> 18:44.550
second six weeks because I just barely got in under 
the wire I couldn't even remember how to study I had

18:16.754 --> 18:44.550
to learn how to study before I learned how to do 
anything else Who did you turn to for advice if you

18:45.965 --> 18:49.629
needed help? Well, sometimes I'd talk to the 
senior guys. But I'd impose on one of my roommates

18:55.916 --> 19:02.523
to send me my business. And he's so busy trying to 
find out what that meant, he didn't have time to

19:02.543 --> 19:06.668
tell me. By the time I got down to the nitty-gritty, 
I had to change forces in order to make it. I talked

19:16.002 --> 19:17.464
to one of the counselors. I don't know who he was, 
who advised me. He said, if you can't make it in

19:20.568 --> 19:25.474
engineering, make it in something else. So I got 
out of the engineering school and went into the

19:25.494 --> 19:31.181
other ladder school. Which one? Well, whatever, 
the English and all that stuff. Oh, arts and

19:34.585 --> 19:35.726
science. Yes. I got a BA in that. That's what I found 
at the end of that year. All right. At the end of your

19:40.893 --> 19:42.735
first year, Did you go back home to McKinney that 
summer? Yes, I went to work. I got a job with Lone

19:48.891 --> 19:55.123
Star Gas Company, and we put pipelines in all over 
East Texas. Do you remember what the pay was? No, I

20:00.573 --> 20:02.397
sure don't. It wasn't very much, though. Who 
helped you get that job? These two guys in the

20:05.767 --> 20:16.703
project house there, they were from Dallas and 
they knew this guy and they would, I think before

20:05.767 --> 20:16.703
they had worked for him. And I got a job inspecting 
wells that we put in pipelines and they'd weld them

20:17.664 --> 20:23.072
together. And they gave me the job of just go by and 
check those wells to see if there were any holes in

20:23.713 --> 20:30.143
them. And with the sun beating down on the back of my 
head, at 110 degrees, and bending over that hot

20:34.403 --> 20:42.774
well to look at that thing, boy, first day I was sick 
as a dog, man. I had eaten something, I don't know

20:43.495 --> 20:45.658
what. It was hard to digest. Boy, they put me in the 
shade for the rest of the afternoon. But you know,

20:52.167 --> 20:54.690
after that, I didn't have any trouble with eating. 
So you did that all summer. Yeah. Then came back,

20:58.215 --> 21:02.360
and this would be, your second year would be the 
fall of 1941. Yes. And so you're now getting ready

21:04.559 --> 21:11.811
to major in arts and sciences. Where did you live 
that second year? Well, I first went back and lived

21:14.395 --> 21:16.759
in the project house. But this man that had the 
truck, I guess, didn't have it anymore, didn't

21:17.761 --> 21:22.589
bring it down. So I had to hitchhike every day. And I 
had an opportunity to go into the project houses.

21:28.739 --> 21:31.123
And as much as I hated to leave the old ladies, I had 
to get someplace where I could make it. So I moved

21:35.852 --> 21:41.960
into Project House 7, which was from Collin County 
or from one of those counties up there. And I moved

21:42.601 --> 21:48.609
in with three other guys from Collin County. About 
how many lived in that Project House total? Well,

21:52.034 --> 21:57.781
there was four of us in that one room, and there was 
about, I guess, about 16. Were they all from Collin

21:59.283 --> 22:00.705
County? No, I don't think so. It had kind of gotten 
diluted, you know, but most of them were from

22:02.761 --> 22:08.613
Collin County. Four of you in one room. Describe 
what was in that room. What kind of furniture?

22:13.703 --> 22:14.665
Well, it was stacked beds. They had two stacked 
beds, and they had, I don't remember whether they

22:14.745 --> 22:22.221
had two tables or what, but they had, I think, 
tables were divided you know you had lights on both

22:23.315 --> 22:48.208
and probably two two guys studied on each side of 
the table so and of course not everybody is

22:23.315 --> 22:48.208
studying at the same time so all right where was the 
shower it was upstairs and it was a communal shower

22:23.315 --> 22:48.208
and i guess probably maybe six or eight Do you 
remember what the cost was to live in the project

22:49.218 --> 22:52.662
house? Yeah. $13 for $13 a month a month. Yeah. And 
mother, she did the cooking. And she had somebody

23:04.577 --> 23:06.379
helping her out. Anyway, feed 16 men, you know, 
three meals a day. Yeah. And did you have any

23:15.891 --> 23:18.094
duties? Did you have to help clean up or wash? Sure. 
I had to make sure that my room was clean. And I used

23:25.518 --> 23:29.023
to, Dr. Russell was the head of that thing. Dr. Dan. 
Yeah. And he started that business. And

23:33.749 --> 23:44.124
I used to go with him over to North Gooch, where he 
bought groceries from this grocery store. He had

23:44.144 --> 23:45.987
them hauled groceries there. And then they had a 
grocery store. a place there in the area where it's

23:48.027 --> 23:55.138
also stocked up on the food. But could you imagine 
room and board at $13? I think it finally went up,

24:01.708 --> 24:05.133
but $13 a month. Did he go to North Zulch to buy 
groceries for the project houses? And you helped

24:11.362 --> 24:12.844
him haul that. Yes. Did he get it from the railroad 
car? Or was there a grocery grocery place over

24:16.465 --> 24:20.330
there? I don't know how they how they managed to use 
that place. But I can recall we went over there and

24:24.475 --> 24:28.460
we load up a big truck. Describe Dr. Russell's 
personality. What kind of a man was he? He was a

24:33.686 --> 24:34.828
wonderful man. He's very thoughtful. And, and he 
had to be a fine man to do all that and start that

24:44.120 --> 24:46.924
thing. Poor guys like me and 900 others could go to a 
place of higher learning without spending their

24:46.984 --> 24:58.039
life savings so to speak. Describe him 
physically. What size was he? He was a big man. What

25:02.685 --> 25:05.048
did he look like? As I recall, he was brunette, and 
at that time, I think he was probably in his sixties

25:06.091 --> 25:14.721
or so. He had a heavy set and everything, and dark 
hair. He had me in the wagon, you know, in our old

25:18.566 --> 25:26.656
bundles and things. Well, we got to that 
interurban station, not the station. We

25:31.859 --> 26:01.343
were

25:31.859 --> 26:01.343
talking about your freshman year and you worked 
for the gas company that fall and then came back and

26:01.762 --> 26:11.535
lived in the project house, did you and the others 
in the project house, did you all do any house

26:01.762 --> 26:11.535
cleaning? We had to clean our own windows. And I 
believe that we were assigned kitchen duties. You

26:19.366 --> 26:28.258
know, we had a week in which we had to go in the 
kitchen and wash dishes or whatever we had to do in

26:19.366 --> 26:28.258
the kitchen. Did you ever bring down from your 
family, did you ever bring part of the groceries?

26:35.159 --> 26:35.239
Yes. What did you bring? Mainly garden stuff, 
which was hard to get down there. My mother was a

26:45.009 --> 26:47.752
good gardener. And all the other guys did the same 
thing. Whatever they had, eggs, you know, they

26:53.298 --> 27:02.189
might be helpful to add up to food. What, in that 
project house, what was not allowed? What were you

27:07.676 --> 27:09.799
all not to do in that house? You couldn't bring your 
drugs. Okay. And, I don't know, everybody had to

27:14.565 --> 27:22.174
respect everybody else's, you know, their space 
and their people. Did

27:22.795 --> 27:31.564
anybody drink

27:22.795 --> 27:31.564
in the house? Oh, no. Oh, no. Not any of that is going 
on. What about smoking? Did you young men smoke in

27:37.190 --> 27:42.435
those? In fact, I had been off cigarettes for 18 
months. I picked up a hat. What was your favorite

27:49.823 --> 27:51.644
brand? Lucky Strike. They were the mildest ones. 
And I guess the easiest ones to quit. I finally quit

27:58.234 --> 28:01.758
when I was 39 years old. Did y'all smoke in the 
house, in the project house? I can't remember

28:04.762 --> 28:08.286
whether or not. Probably did. Did anybody chew 
tobacco in there? Not that I know of. No snuff? No.

28:17.538 --> 28:19.200
And I don't remember too many guys. I'll say that. 
You know, it's addictive. It's addictive. Like

28:22.938 --> 28:31.229
me, when I got back down there and started smoking, 
I picked up the habits. Where did you do your

28:31.429 --> 28:33.452
washing? They had a washout. You'd go in there and 
wash. The other thing, I guess, were the washing

28:39.400 --> 28:45.968
machines over there? I think that's all there was 
to do in there. Did it cost anything? Yeah, I

28:52.671 --> 28:53.472
believe you had to pay.

29:01.242 --> 29:04.386
And so you lived there all of your sophomore year? 
How many years did you live in the project house?

29:06.949 --> 29:11.636
Well, I stayed there until I went into service in 
1942. So that was two years ago. camaraderie.

29:27.050 --> 29:35.803
With four of you in a room, how did you all work it out 
that the lights would go off? How did you keep

29:38.146 --> 29:41.771
somebody from studying into the wee hours of the 
night? What were the rules about turning the

29:42.172 --> 29:45.056
lights on and off? I don't recall. I don't know. It 
never seemed to be easy. and nobody ever had

29:52.207 --> 30:12.831
anything stolen and

29:52.207 --> 30:12.831
you're still you were in the orchestra during all 
this time and still traveling

30:15.072 --> 30:42.835
What,

30:15.072 --> 30:42.835
were

30:15.072 --> 30:42.835
they

30:15.072 --> 30:42.835
wanting German music or Czech music? Now, some of 
the nationally famous big bands came to A&M. Do you

30:51.503 --> 30:52.804
remember some of those? Well, Stan Kenton one 
time, his music was far off the beat, you know, a lot

30:53.245 --> 31:02.037
of music. But we had Stan Kenton. We had,

31:05.682 --> 31:13.092
I don't know, I didn't know, I didn't know. tommy
