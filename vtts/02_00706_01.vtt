WEBVTT

00:03.659 --> 00:05.321
County Engineering Department. Today's date is 
September 4th, 1981. Dr. Hawkins, let us begin by

00:08.905 --> 00:16.194
your telling something about your early years in 
Kentucky.

00:16.214 --> 00:21.961
Well, as I said, I was born in a little coal mining 
town called Weeksbury, Kentucky. That's

00:22.021 --> 00:24.203
W-E-E-K-S-B-U-R-Y. It was a town of about a 
thousand people, no less than that probably.

00:30.450 --> 00:33.473
Typical Eastern Kentucky coal mining town. My dad 
in early years was a engineer in the sense of a

00:34.935 --> 00:43.286
railroad engineer. He ran the power plant and then 
he got in the grocery store business and I grew up in

00:43.306 --> 00:50.736
that environment. My dad was a merchant.

00:54.661 --> 00:55.722
During the World War II years, we moved to 
Louisville, Kentucky.

01:02.569 --> 01:05.352
My father worked for DuPont. After World War II, we 
moved back to eastern Kentucky to a different town

01:06.614 --> 01:12.120
called Wheelwright. That's 
W-A-T-E-L-W-R-I-G-H-T. One word? Yes. It was a

01:18.528 --> 01:22.232
different coal mining town, and my dad went back 
into the grocery business, and I finished, or grew

01:22.786 --> 01:30.536
up in that environment, finished high school 
there. Well, actually I didn't finish high

01:30.556 --> 01:33.199
school. I went through the junior year, and I was 
lucky enough to receive a Ford Foundation

01:33.219 --> 01:44.674
scholarship, which was an experimental program 
at the time. What year was this? Let's see, that

01:47.617 --> 01:51.983
must have been about 54.

01:54.157 --> 01:55.499
Sounds about right. Plus or minus a year. Been a 
while. And so I missed my senior year in high school

01:58.884 --> 02:02.169
and went to University of Louisville. The program 
was to

02:02.490 --> 02:12.004
test the relevance of the senior year in high 
school.

02:13.006 --> 02:16.411
I struggled through those years. Of course, I came 
from a small country school.

02:22.743 --> 02:32.612
Went to college without all the necessary

02:22.743 --> 02:32.612
preparation in chemistry and physics and 
trigonometry. So it was an interesting

02:34.614 --> 02:37.516
experience. I survived. University of 
Louisville was a very fine engineering school,

02:39.098 --> 02:43.061
majored in mechanical engineering. Went through 
their co-op program, and after about I guess two

02:51.667 --> 02:56.692
and a half years, I was going on another co-op 
program. And I happened to visit home. And my

02:59.074 --> 03:10.644
former principal of the high school I graduated 
from, or finished in,

02:59.074 --> 03:10.644
persuaded me to teach high school for a year. He 
convinced me that was a better experience than a

03:11.145 --> 03:14.868
co-op.

03:16.449 --> 03:17.370
It was an experience. When did you complete? Did 
you complete the bachelor's program in

03:19.072 --> 03:21.454
engineering University of Louisville? No. I was 
going on a co-op period. I was probably two and a

03:26.625 --> 03:29.787
half years into the program. And so when I went back 
to teach high school, at that time, Louisville was

03:30.868 --> 03:39.896
a quite intense school, and I guess I had an 
equivalent of about 104 or 105 semester hours. And

03:41.157 --> 03:50.084
that was sufficient for a high school teaching 
certificate, a temporary certificate. And so,

03:50.104 --> 03:53.247
like I said, my principal convinced me that that 
was better experience than co-op. And so I taught

03:59.238 --> 04:00.660
high school for a year. What year was that, 57, 58?

04:05.786 --> 04:06.667
Sounds about right.

04:09.670 --> 04:10.891
What did you teach, science? Taught mathematics, 
algebra, geometry, and biology. Was it difficult

04:19.741 --> 04:23.706
to attract teachers in that part of the state? 
Probably not during that time. They just had ended

04:27.624 --> 04:29.886
up with an opening. And I was passing through town 
at that time. And it looked like a reasonably good

04:32.790 --> 04:38.457
experience. It was, like I said. How were you when 
you were teaching? Well, that was the interesting

04:43.342 --> 04:44.624
part. Let's see, I was, because I left high school a 
year early, I was probably about, I went to college

04:44.904 --> 04:54.756
when I was 17, so I was about 19 probably. maybe 20. 
Did you have some of the students who were older

04:55.989 --> 04:58.832
than you? Yeah. And of course, a lot of my friends 
who I had known as freshmen were still always

05:01.295 --> 05:05.880
teaching them. So it was an interesting 
experience. Did they take advantage of the

05:07.602 --> 05:09.985
attempt to? No. No. In fact, I guess I was, like all 
young people, a rebel. And the principal and I had

05:14.190 --> 05:17.755
some disagreement. I think I ended up flunking 
about half of the mathematics classes. I don't

05:22.698 --> 05:30.490
think I failed anybody in biology, because my 
attitude was they probably, I probably was not an

05:22.698 --> 05:30.490
expert in biology, but I figured I knew 
mathematics. And I was persuaded to, or tried to

05:31.611 --> 05:38.421
convince me that really we shouldn't be flunking 
people. And I guess that was where I got my first

05:39.102 --> 05:50.359
experience to my ideas about what was wrong with 
education, that the philosophy was that maybe we

05:39.102 --> 05:50.359
ought to keep them off the street. don't agree with 
that philosophy, and I still don't. And I think

05:54.171 --> 05:55.633
education is a privilege. But I finished school 
then. I mean, finished teaching school. And of

06:01.379 --> 06:14.235
course, when I

06:01.379 --> 06:14.235
prepared to re-enter University of Louisville, 
because I had taught, I had gotten out of sequence

06:01.379 --> 06:14.235
in co-op. And so what happened, I didn't go back 
this summer. I worked that summer. I had prepared

06:21.136 --> 06:25.040
to go back in the fall and pick up where I went, where 
I left off. And I got on the wrong co-op sequence.

06:28.643 --> 06:33.849
And University of Louisville, the way it was, the 
way they ran the program is there was two different

06:28.643 --> 06:33.849
classes. And if you went on, you staggered them. 
And so it would have been necessary to stay away a

06:37.312 --> 06:41.196
year or a quarter. So I decided to transfer schools 
and went to University of Kentucky. And so I

06:45.780 --> 06:47.702
finished, got my B.S. at University of Kentucky in 
mechanical engineering. What year was that? It

06:52.617 --> 06:53.438
was 1960.

06:58.702 --> 06:59.943
I must have started at 55. I can't remember. It took 
five years to go through with teaching. When you

07:03.347 --> 07:07.050
were teaching school that year, do you remember 
what your salary was? I have no idea. I was curious

07:09.472 --> 07:13.155
for a comparison purposes. It probably was under 
$3,000 a year. I wouldn't have the slightest idea.

07:22.628 --> 07:24.331
Okay, you completed your B.S. from the University 
of Kentucky. Yes. Where? Lexington? Lexington.

07:30.360 --> 07:31.922
In 1960, a mechanical engineer. 1960, right. 
Okay, how did the experiences with your father and

07:32.843 --> 07:43.299
some parts of his relationship with coal mining, 
how did this affect your career choice? Did that

07:44.521 --> 07:46.624
have anything to do with it? Well, I guess most 
engineers, you tend to be, mechanically

07:50.033 --> 07:51.415
inclined. I suppose in my, some facts about 
engineering, I think it's changed now, but up

07:51.936 --> 08:12.346
until

07:51.936 --> 08:12.346
this generation, most engineering students are 
typically the first

07:51.936 --> 08:12.346
child in the family to get a college education. 
It's typically the first professional programs.

08:15.831 --> 08:16.632
And also a lot of young men at that time went into the 
program because they liked machinery. They liked

08:21.371 --> 08:22.272
automobiles. That's what got me there. You 
related to automobiles and trains and airplanes

08:24.574 --> 08:31.460
as being what you were involved in. And when I got 
the Ford Foundation scholarship, the

08:32.601 --> 08:38.407
scholarship required a science education. And 
basically my choices were physics, mathematics,

08:39.247 --> 08:44.172
or engineering. And I chose engineering 
primarily because of the association with

08:44.962 --> 08:50.567
machinery.

08:53.770 --> 09:00.376
Young people usually go into engineering 
thinking that they're going to immediately build

08:53.770 --> 09:00.376
cars. And you find out that engineering really is 
very mathematically oriented and not what you

09:00.396 --> 09:07.043
thought it was. But usually by the time you're 
halfway through, it's too late to back out. But in

09:13.126 --> 09:16.689
any case, I graduated University of Kentucky in 
1960.

09:19.952 --> 09:22.094
Where did you get your master's degree? I studied 
at University of Kentucky. I probably am like most

09:25.497 --> 09:30.582
young people. I got a master's degree because 
somebody asked me to. And being young and naive at

09:34.166 --> 09:38.590
the time, I was very flattered. But at the time, we 
had an old German fella. called Carl Otto Lang. And

09:46.866 --> 09:56.660
along

09:46.866 --> 09:56.660
with my senior year, I had the opportunity to take a 
class from him. And he flattered me by saying that I

09:58.102 --> 10:01.547
should stay in graduate school. And that was a bit 
different than it is now when we

10:01.627 --> 10:11.061
try to get everybody into graduate school. So I did 
stay, and he was director of what was called the

10:11.952 --> 10:17.899
Wintergren Aeronautical Lab.

10:21.023 --> 10:30.595
It's W-E-N-N-E-R hyphen G-R-E-N. And Wintergren 
is,

10:21.023 --> 10:30.595
the money was donated. Wintergren happened to be 
the man who was behind the Electrolux

10:30.655 --> 10:33.659
Corporation. And his nationality, it seemed that 
he was European. I think he was possibly Swiss or

10:39.366 --> 10:41.689
whatever. But he donated a laboratory, and I 
understand during World War II there was some

10:42.665 --> 10:51.837
question about his allegiance and some cloud over 
the whole thing. But in any case, Dr. Lang was the

10:51.857 --> 10:56.703
director of the lab. At that time, most of the work 
we were doing, they were doing, was in

10:56.743 --> 11:01.509
bioengineering. And so I went to work for him and 
got involved in the bioengineering program, got

11:02.791 --> 11:12.503
interested in that program, did a lot of work in... 
All over everything. I'll tell you a bit about the

11:16.076 --> 11:30.381
work, but the laboratory was under contract of the 
Air Force, and we were doing work in human

11:16.076 --> 11:30.381
tolerance studies, tolerance to acceleration 
and vibration. We were also doing a program of

11:30.401 --> 11:36.432
training chimpanzees for space flight at that 
time.

11:37.964 --> 11:41.369
I was not directly involved in the chimpanzee 
training program. My involvement was in the human

11:41.930 --> 11:44.895
tolerance side. Very interesting experience. We 
spent probably half our time at Wright-Patterson

11:47.999 --> 11:54.229
Air Force Base in Dayton doing experimental work 
on human subjects. And of course, about half time

11:55.811 --> 12:02.722
in research at the University in Lexington. And I 
finished that program. 1961, and by that time I

12:06.905 --> 12:13.533
failed to mention that I was married a couple of 
years earlier. We had a child and felt that we

12:14.214 --> 12:22.623
couldn't afford to go on to pursue a PhD. Had had to 
borrow money to get as far as I was, so we were forced

12:23.284 --> 12:28.090
to go to industry.

12:30.993 --> 12:36.760
I guess I made my mind up about the time I entered 
graduate school that I would eventually get a PhD.

12:37.212 --> 12:41.015
When did you finish the MA? In 62? No, 61. It took a 
year and a half. December of 61, I think it was.

12:45.639 --> 12:47.981
Okay, and then what company did you work for? I went 
to work at Pratt & Whitney Aircraft first. It's

12:51.925 --> 12:56.769
P-R-A-T-T and W-H-I-T-N-E-Y Aircraft. And Pratt 
& Whitney is one of the two major jet engine

12:58.370 --> 13:03.195
manufacturers. Is that in California? No. Pratt 
the home or the base operations in Connecticut.

13:10.993 --> 13:14.217
But they had recently built a research and 
development center in Florida. So I went with

13:15.218 --> 13:17.721
their research and development center in 
Florida. That's West Palm Beach. I

13:21.627 --> 13:27.374
went into what they call their applied research 
division. And probably 10 people when I arrived

13:29.196 --> 13:35.805
and 150 when I left. So I was there during most of the 
growth years. I suppose I stayed with Pratt &

13:41.759 --> 13:45.624
Whitney about three years. I'm not good at dates. 
And left Pratt & Whitney and went to Huntsville,

13:48.387 --> 13:57.277
Alabama with Chrysler Corporation and their 
space division. Headed up a group of engineers

13:59.519 --> 14:01.742
there.

14:04.709 --> 14:14.901
Worked for Chrysler about a similar amount of time 
and decided that it was time to get serious about

14:04.709 --> 14:14.901
education again. I ended up going from Chrysler 
Corporation to Brown Engineering

14:16.563 --> 14:24.812
for several reasons. One is some

14:25.093 --> 14:33.923
dissatisfaction with Chrysler management.

14:35.067 --> 14:40.312
a better opportunity and a better opportunity to 
go to school. Where was this at? It's in

14:42.755 --> 14:44.617
Huntsville. They were both in Huntsville. So I 
started back to school and going at nights and I

14:46.319 --> 14:55.128
took over University of Alabama in Huntsville is 
where I started.

14:58.251 --> 15:02.715
Taking a course at night, this seemed difficult 
with the job I had. I was in management. And so I

15:05.105 --> 15:14.595
asked Brown to transfer me to the research 
division so that I would not have to be involved

15:05.105 --> 15:14.595
with people to pursue my education. And they did. 
So I had the opportunity to work by myself on my own

15:15.415 --> 15:20.861
projects. And I guess I went for another year 
trying to take courses at night and decided that

15:21.421 --> 15:28.829
was not the way to get an advanced education. And 
ultimately went back to school full time at the

15:30.531 --> 15:34.875
University of Alabama at Tuscaloosa. and 
graduated with a PhD in engineering mechanics in

15:36.070 --> 15:43.159
1969.

15:46.823 --> 15:50.909
Went from there to West Virginia University in 
Morgantown. Spent six years there as a professor,

15:53.151 --> 16:00.240
associate professor, mechanical engineering. 
Well, actually, that's not quite correct. When I

16:03.155 --> 16:12.649
first went to school there, it was a, they had a 
department of theoretical and applied

16:03.155 --> 16:12.649
mechanics, which is where I joined. After about 
three years, I guess I remember, the department

16:14.211 --> 16:19.959
was combined with the mechanical engineering 
department. The mechanical engineering

16:20.039 --> 16:25.808
department head stepped down for whatever 
reason, I don't know. And the decision was made to

16:26.889 --> 16:31.035
combine departments, and the department head who 
was And the mechanics department became the head

16:31.876 --> 16:35.901
of the combined department. So we were mechanical 
engineering and mechanics. But anyway, I stayed

16:39.506 --> 16:42.610
there for six years. Got involved in a lot of 
different research areas.

16:49.899 --> 16:53.684
Left there and went to Memphis State University as 
department chairman. Stayed there two years and

16:55.406 --> 16:57.509
came here in your four years. In 1977, you came 
here? Is that four years ago? That's what it would

17:01.274 --> 17:02.195
be. How did you happen to come to Texas A&M?

17:08.483 --> 17:11.086
Well, the job was open. It was advertised. I can't 
remember whether I was recommended or applied,

17:14.350 --> 17:18.114
but essentially applied. And I was offered the 
job. You came in what capacity? Department head.

17:26.865 --> 17:28.647
You came directly as department head?

17:34.027 --> 17:41.017
What are some of the duties that you undertake now 
as department head, just generally? Well, of all

17:41.037 --> 17:49.048
the things, I guess it's probably the most 
difficult to talk about is what I do as department

17:41.037 --> 17:49.048
head.

17:52.433 --> 17:57.541
I suppose it's more appropriate to find out what 
you want to know in this interview. Obviously, we

17:58.141 --> 18:03.409
could talk for the rest of the week about various 
aspects of my life. It might be well, let me ask you

18:04.418 --> 18:27.244
again, what are you really trying to get out of the 
interview as far as we've gone through a brief, or

18:04.418 --> 18:27.244
do you want to concentrate on the past history or 
recent history? Just what you've experienced as

18:27.384 --> 18:31.489
you've been here now since we got up to this point. 
Well, I think it would be well to talk a little bit

18:32.650 --> 18:37.114
about the department and A&M as I see it.

18:41.619 --> 18:48.806
From my perspective, A&M, as you well know, is an 
old school. And I like to explain to people as a

18:48.826 --> 18:54.612
college, it's 105 years old or whatever. As a 
university, it's maybe 20. So A&M is a university

18:58.836 --> 19:02.640
very much in transition. from numbers, because of 
its goals, its place in society, its attitudes

19:03.228 --> 19:13.438
about itself.

19:17.382 --> 19:33.218
To tell you an experience, when I interviewed for 
the job, I had a

19:17.382 --> 19:33.218
I happened to be interviewing at the time when The 
department was having the Pytos Sigma banquet.

19:36.888 --> 19:44.015
That's our honorary

19:36.888 --> 19:44.015
society.

19:44.035 --> 19:48.799
Pytos Sigma's Greek letter is 
P-I-T-A-U-S-I-G-E-M-A.

19:48.819 --> 19:53.984
That's the Mechanical Engineering Honorary 
Society.

19:54.384 --> 19:59.029
The reason the job was opening, the individual who 
was in the job was retiring, Cliff Semaine. And

20:00.270 --> 20:02.732
Clifford had been in the job. About 24 years, best I 
can remember. I'm interviewing him first. OK. So

20:08.904 --> 20:14.090
Cliff,

20:08.904 --> 20:14.090
are you interviewing Charlie Crawford? I haven't 
set that one up yet. Do. The most important one of

20:18.015 --> 20:20.297
all three of us is Charlie Crawford.

20:25.003 --> 20:32.652
But in any case, the

20:25.003 --> 20:32.652
interesting thing about that, I was first 
impressed that someone had survived as a

20:33.796 --> 20:38.482
department head for 24 years. That's even more 
amazing now that I really know what it means to be

20:41.065 --> 20:45.310
department head at A&M. But at the banquet, he went 
and introduced me to somebody. And he introduced

20:51.037 --> 20:52.419
me to Charlie Crawford. And Charlie was 
department head for maybe 27 years. I need to talk

20:58.547 --> 21:01.170
to Charlie about that. The impressive thing about 
meeting those two men standing in the same place,

21:01.977 --> 21:09.667
that represented a half a century of this 
department. And that

21:10.868 --> 21:22.002
period represented a lot of changes, but not the 
drastic ones. Tremendous history. And not only

21:24.986 --> 21:31.714
did it represent a half a century of the 
department, but also half of the whole history of

21:32.504 --> 21:36.088
the department, was standing there and two living 
men. I remember my comment at the time, I said I

21:37.510 --> 21:42.056
certainly wanted a job, because obviously you 
live forever. It must be an easy job, but I found out

21:42.997 --> 21:45.780
it really wasn't. But A&M, up until that time, was a 
relatively, from my perception, a relatively

21:47.142 --> 21:57.935
stable organization. I guess the university 
changed presidents and relatively often, like

22:02.525 --> 22:04.707
most universities do. But department heads were 
in place for a long period of time. Deans had

22:08.972 --> 22:13.237
generally long enough time to put programs into 
effect. And the administration was stable.

22:18.443 --> 22:26.091
Cliffs of Maine, quite literally, is a giant of a 
man, if you haven't met Cliff.

22:26.251 --> 22:27.432
He's an imposing figure. He's about 6'4".

22:32.680 --> 22:48.699
a fine man, but characteristically probably as 
different from me as one could get in that Cliff ran

22:32.680 --> 22:48.699
the department like A&M was run, had been run for a 
hundred years. He was a retired general in

22:50.421 --> 22:52.923
reserve. He ran the department with a lot of 
discipline and with very much the way I would

22:59.798 --> 23:06.267
suppose that A&M as a college was run 20 years 
earlier. From my perception, A&M came into the

23:07.869 --> 23:13.076
20th century a step at a time. They made the 
transition literally of a department at a time,

23:14.337 --> 23:21.927
which I think was very appropriate. No one seemed 
to be in a great haste. I think our dean, Dean

23:25.272 --> 23:29.097
Benson, which I really think is probably in my 
estimation, a real giant of a man, shows the time

23:29.701 --> 23:39.735
when Glyphosate of Maine retired to make a change 
in the department. As you may know, we are

23:41.898 --> 23:47.525
organized both as a department and as a research 
division. As an example, this department is a

23:48.827 --> 23:56.738
division of the Texas Engineering Experiment 
Station and also a department of mechanical

23:48.827 --> 23:56.738
engineering. Right now, I hold both titles. I'm 
the head of the Mechanical Engineering

23:58.647 --> 24:00.369
Department. I'm also head of the Mechanical 
Engineering Division of the Texas Engineering

24:00.949 --> 24:05.733
Experiment Station. Cliff was not. This duty was 
shared by another individual. So he concentrated

24:09.697 --> 24:15.782
on the academic program, primarily the 
undergraduate program. When I came, my charge

24:17.103 --> 24:21.387
from Fred Benson was quite simple. It was a 
two-paragraph charge to build a graduate

24:21.427 --> 24:26.691
research program of equal quality to our 
undergraduate program and to concentrate on

24:27.127 --> 24:34.015
those research areas that are important to the 
state of Texas. And I repeat that. Whatever chance

24:37.338 --> 24:40.862
I get when I'm asked what our goals are, I say that's 
what our goals are. I see no reason to change it. I

24:43.205 --> 24:44.707
think it's what we're in business for. But quite 
obviously, the need for building research and

24:46.248 --> 24:55.699
graduate programs and reputations of the 
university, the college within the university,

24:56.573 --> 24:59.756
in the department within the college was 
important for several reasons.

25:02.759 --> 25:16.013
One is, from my perception, when you're a 
relatively small

25:02.759 --> 25:16.013
college, you can assume a role quite differently 
than when you're a major university. People

25:16.673 --> 25:18.335
perceive you differently. They perceive quality 
differently. When you suddenly become the

25:23.801 --> 25:26.023
largest college of engineering possibly in the 
world, certainly in the nation. The largest

25:29.211 --> 25:35.237
department of mechanical engineering is not 
sufficient to just do undergraduate education.

25:36.478 --> 25:39.141
People start measuring you against your peer 
group. And of course, I think our peer group happen

25:39.201 --> 25:47.949
to be schools, large state schools like Purdue and 
Georgia Tech and Illinois and Virginia Tech. And

25:49.010 --> 25:53.715
so the outside world, whether it's other 
students, whether it's the community, or whether

25:54.320 --> 26:00.309
it's the government, a perceived quality of where 
you stand in your peer groups. So we said as a major

26:01.671 --> 26:20.698
objective was to fulfill this particular role and 
build our

26:01.671 --> 26:20.698
research of the quality and quantity that would be 
expected in the University Department of

26:01.671 --> 26:20.698
Science. When I came, I guess the department was, 
within the college, very near the bottom in

26:23.142 --> 26:29.972
research. To tell you some statistics, we have 
grown in enrollment from a little over 800 to about

26:32.195 --> 26:41.409
1,700 this fall. So we've just about doubled in 
enrollment. In four years. In four years. In the

26:47.037 --> 26:50.062
graduate enrollment, it's grown about 300%. 
We've about tripled the graduate enrollment.

26:52.927 --> 26:56.092
about 30 to a little over 90. In research, we've 
gone from about 200,000 to a little over 2 million.

27:05.285 --> 27:07.688
So we've grown about 1,000% in research. We've 
more than doubled our faculty, which is not

27:09.090 --> 27:21.027
sufficient, obviously, because we've gone from a 
faculty, I don't remember the exact number, from

27:09.090 --> 27:21.027
about 30 to, I suppose right now, We have two 
unfilled positions, but we would be about 69, 67,

27:21.445 --> 27:27.853
somewhere in there. I'm embarrassed to say I can't 
remember. So the faculty is doubled with almost

27:29.294 --> 27:42.650
covering the undergraduate enrollment, but it 
doesn't cover the tremendous expansion in the

27:29.294 --> 27:42.650
research program. This research now puts the 
department second in the college. We like to point

27:51.230 --> 27:57.760
out that we're second to civil engineering, which 
is very heavily involved with the Texas

27:51.230 --> 27:57.760
Transportation Institute. So we've done quite 
well in meeting our goals. Our faculty

28:04.049 --> 28:12.182
publications have gone from about, the data's 
hard to get from four years ago, but two or three per

28:04.049 --> 28:12.182
year to this year, about 100. And so this faculty, 
of course, I'm very proud of. But I think it's an

28:17.189 --> 28:20.494
extremely productive faculty. I spend most of my 
time trying to get people to recognize the

28:21.166 --> 28:27.514
tremendous productivity of this faculty. We have 
a teaching load that's about double any other

28:28.516 --> 28:36.706
college of engineering, Department of 
Mechanical Engineering in the state. We teach

28:38.228 --> 28:44.637
about twice as much as a typical faculty at the 
University of Houston or University of Texas. How

28:45.338 --> 28:48.321
much is that, 12 hours? Our average teaching load 
has gone down to about 10 hours, but only because

28:52.047 --> 28:56.611
our class sizes have gone up to over 200. So we're 
really, our teaching load is still there. We

29:00.275 --> 29:05.580
haven't been able to

29:00.275 --> 29:05.580
be very honest. I'm not convinced yet that this is 
the direction to go in large classes. This is an

29:13.587 --> 29:21.835
experiment that was very much suggested by our 
dean, and we're trying to see an effect.

29:23.333 --> 29:31.823
The data is not all in, but I'm not pleased with it. 
So in any case, the department has gone through a

29:31.843 --> 29:39.713
tremendous transition, not without some growing 
pains. We've lost several of the faculty who were

29:40.975 --> 29:45.340
here for a long time. We've had several people 
decide to choose careers in industry. So we have a

29:51.464 --> 29:59.412
very young faculty that probably, I suppose, in 
the short four years, I've hired about 75% of the

29:51.464 --> 29:59.412
faculty. So the department is one that's in 
transition. We've started numerous new

30:02.515 --> 30:05.278
programs. Our research programs,

30:06.219 --> 30:12.585
well, they're quite broad. We can go in detail. But 
essentially, every program that's ongoing is

30:14.087 --> 30:18.631
new. It's less than four years old. So we've 
changed from predominantly an undergraduate

30:21.198 --> 30:31.291
department to what we hope is becoming a much more 
balanced graduate research and undergraduate

30:21.198 --> 30:31.291
education department. But you said mechanical 
engineering has the second highest enrollment in

30:31.732 --> 30:36.418
the Department of Engineering. No, no. I think we 
have the highest enrollment. You compared it as

30:39.742 --> 30:42.486
second to civil engineering in what capacity? In 
dollars of research. Now, in numbers of students,

30:50.729 --> 30:59.259
We have more students, significantly more 
students, than any degree-granting program in

30:50.729 --> 30:59.259
the college, significantly more. The industrial 
engineering department is a conglomerate of

31:00.000 --> 31:08.089
computer science, industrial engineering, 
safety engineering, and bioengineering. And I

31:08.550 --> 31:12.795
think collectively, they probably have as many or 
a few more students than we do. As an example, I

31:13.776 --> 31:19.943
don't know the exact figures, but the industrial 
engineering program may be 400 students to our

31:13.776 --> 31:19.943
1,700. Computer science may be 1,000. They may be 
more. I don't know. Bio may be a couple hundred.

31:25.836 --> 31:28.079
Collectively, they're an equivalent science 
department. These new faculty people that you

31:29.301 --> 31:40.818
have hired, what are some of the institutions

31:29.301 --> 31:40.818
that

31:29.301 --> 31:40.818
they have come from? Oh, let me think. Just say over 
the last two years. I can remember. I'd have to look

31:43.401 --> 31:45.384
up the rest of them. Well, we have faculty from 
Berkeley, from MIT, from Virginia Tech. from Penn

31:50.585 --> 32:07.464
State, from Ohio State, from Purdue, Oklahoma 
State, University of Texas,

31:50.585 --> 32:07.464
Lehigh, Georgia Tech.

32:07.484 --> 32:10.047
Let me pause a minute and start to think of 
individuals.

32:15.473 --> 32:16.614
University of Illinois.

32:19.717 --> 32:20.338
I would say that of the people that we brought into 
the department during the last four years, 85% to

32:20.909 --> 32:32.807
90% are from what would be considered the top 10 
engineering schools. And the only school in the

32:34.249 --> 32:49.431
state, for example, well, I would say that the only 
schools I can recall that would not be considered

32:34.249 --> 32:49.431
in the top 10 would be we hired one fellow from SMU.

32:51.335 --> 32:52.537
I don't know if I mentioned Berkeley. We have a 
couple of guys from Berkeley, from USC,

32:52.677 --> 33:00.607
University of Southern California. We have a guy 
on the staff now from the Technion in Israel. Can

33:06.995 --> 33:09.258
you spell that? Can't. Technion is, I would 
consider, the best technical university in

33:10.820 --> 33:18.810
Israel and one of the best in the world. It's 
certainly equivalent to our best engineering

33:18.830 --> 33:21.173
schools. Do you have very many women enrolling in 
mechanical engineering? It's increasing

33:27.472 --> 33:28.633
yearly. I'd say our overall average is somewhere 
around close to 15%. Each class is a little larger

33:33.519 --> 33:37.423
than the other. I would say overall now it's about 
15%. The freshman enrollment may be up to around

33:41.228 --> 33:43.871
20%, 25%. It increases each year. Do you find that 
women students enrolling are... in about the same

33:51.173 --> 33:53.596
capacity as the male students? No, I think they're 
superior. In what regard? Every regard,

33:56.801 --> 33:58.483
intellectually. I'm talking on the average.

34:03.390 --> 34:11.141
I would say also I would point out that I've been 
department head or chairman of two universities.

34:11.161 --> 34:12.442
This makes a total of six years. I think this is the 
first year that the American Society of

34:13.203 --> 34:19.392
Mechanical Engineering student chapter has not 
been chaired by a woman. And this is an elective

34:20.148 --> 34:22.751
position by the students. And this says something 
about their leadership ability and

34:23.932 --> 34:27.756
aggressiveness. And so it's not just a matter of a 
good student intellectually. The females that

34:33.882 --> 34:44.633
are coming to engineering, obviously, it takes a 
little bit more of aggression and desire to break

34:33.882 --> 34:44.633
into a male-dominated field. So the women that are 
choosing engineering My personal feeling is not

34:47.519 --> 34:58.372
necessarily the cross-section of the female 
population, but the ones that have the better

34:47.519 --> 34:58.372
mental ability, but also the higher desire and 
motivation. And it's proving that way in class. I

35:01.035 --> 35:11.587
don't think my personal feeling is, I think on a 
whole you'd find the male and female population

35:01.035 --> 35:11.587
about the same, but right now those who are 
choosing engineering are certainly the

35:01.035 --> 35:11.587
pioneering type. Why do you have so few blacks who 
enroll in engineering programs? I have no idea.

35:17.405 --> 35:18.206
Absolutely none. I may have personal opinions, 
but they're worthless. Are you talking about at

35:22.991 --> 35:25.814
A&M or in general? Either. My personal feeling is 
A&M, we are

35:27.976 --> 35:40.349
somehow, we have to bring Prairie View in as a 
factor. I think the students who choose to go to

35:40.369 --> 35:46.095
this system look at the opportunity to go to 
Prairie View A&M or Texas A&M, and both have

35:47.932 --> 35:55.021
engineering schools. And those who choose to go to 
engineering have to make a choice of one of the two.

36:02.090 --> 36:05.394
I don't know how that relates, but I'm sure it must 
relate. And I'm sure that must somehow influence

36:06.035 --> 36:13.585
the decision of a young black of saying, do I go to 
school that's has an engineering program, is very

36:14.122 --> 36:27.963
oriented toward my culture and my race, or do I go to 
a school which has a great reputation but is

36:14.122 --> 36:27.963
predominantly white, maybe doesn't understand 
my culture or my problems? And I don't know how that

36:27.983 --> 36:30.106
affects a student. I haven't sat down and quizzed 
one. But a personal opinion that must enter into

36:31.769 --> 36:35.474
decision making. I think all engineering schools 
that blacks do not choose engineering as a career

36:43.265 --> 36:44.987
as readily as they do others. Again, you have 
opinions. I think a lot of it is you hear people say

36:48.772 --> 36:52.777
role models. I think role models has definitely a 
factor. I think preparation is a factor. I think

36:59.785 --> 37:11.500
in the past, I think black students have not 
necessarily got an equivalent education or been

36:59.785 --> 37:11.500
encouraged to take science and mathematics as a 
preparation force. for college, and it's

37:12.307 --> 37:13.970
certainly necessary.

37:17.194 --> 37:19.999
I guess I question one thing I don't understand. As 
I mentioned earlier, in the past, people who chose

37:20.039 --> 37:28.972
engineering were typically the first child in the 
family that was college educated. And of course,

37:29.874 --> 37:37.285
in the black community, this is a similar 
situation to what you saw in the farm communities a

37:29.874 --> 37:37.285
generation or two ago. But it seems that many of the 
blacks are choosing business or one of the other

37:38.108 --> 37:44.996
professions as the first profession as opposed to 
engineering. So why the change, I don't know. What

37:48.119 --> 37:55.507
salary levels do starting mechanical engineers 
command today?

37:55.527 --> 37:57.089
In the neighborhood of $25,000 a year. Do people 
with higher degrees expect higher salaries? Yes.

38:03.456 --> 38:04.217
How much? A master's degree, and these should not 
be taken as exact figures. They're available if we

38:09.421 --> 38:10.663
want them. But a master's degree typically is 
$1,500 to $2,000 a year or more. A PhD, it's hard to

38:17.373 --> 38:23.802
put a figure on it because it's so much variation 
with individuals and where they go and desire. But

38:24.483 --> 38:32.955
I would say a PhD might average, and this is my 
personal guess, another $5,000 a year or more

38:24.483 --> 38:32.955
starting salary than a BS so that he a BS maybe 25, a 
master's maybe 27, a PhD around 30 to 32, somewhere

38:33.526 --> 38:40.233
in there. What are some of the companies that 
mechanical engineering graduates from here

38:40.253 --> 38:43.917
would go to work for? I would take the rest of the 
day. Just a few of the major, a couple or three of the

38:46.680 --> 38:49.863
major ones? Oh, here, of course, in the chemical 
companies, all of them. Selenese, Dow, DuPont,

38:55.249 --> 39:01.896
Monsanto, and, of course, in the petroleum 
companies, all of them. Exxon, Shell, Gulf. What

39:04.785 --> 39:10.233
type of reputation do A&M graduates of 
engineering have in industry? The

39:10.253 --> 39:14.759
undergraduates, I think, second to none. I base 
that on, obviously, what recruiters tell me and

39:14.779 --> 39:19.326
what my friends in the industry tell me. And I'm 
convinced that our undergraduates in

39:20.467 --> 39:31.663
engineering in general, and certainly 
mechanical, have a...

39:33.668 --> 39:34.649
Extremely high reputation.

39:38.353 --> 39:42.959
Our graduate students are good. I can't say that 
people would come to A&M and see a graduate

39:43.359 --> 39:49.186
student, say, above MIT. But it would be just the 
opposite in undergraduate. And I think there's

39:52.830 --> 39:54.932
reasons for it. I think our students, well, 
clearly, as I tell my students, we don't have

39:55.192 --> 40:01.520
better faculty. We have better students. And I 
believe that. We get a better product in the front

40:04.448 --> 40:07.992
door, and we end up with a better product leaving. 
So what makes our students better? Several

40:09.754 --> 40:10.194
things. We get a good student. Intellectually, 
he's as good or better than any other student in

40:12.497 --> 40:15.380
engineering. His motivation is by far better than 
any school I've been associated with. I get the

40:19.864 --> 40:24.289
impression that kids don't come to A&M and College 
Station and have a good time. I feel the decisions

40:25.010 --> 40:26.752
are made back in high school. If they're looking 
for a social experience, they don't necessarily

40:27.773 --> 40:31.036
choose A&M. Choose University of Texas or someone 
else. We

40:34.503 --> 40:41.532
work our students hard, and our curriculum is a 
little bit longer than most. So our students end up

40:42.293 --> 40:49.343
with mechanical engineering almost a semester 
longer than, say, the average, the national

40:42.293 --> 40:49.343
average. So really, when you get an A&M mechanical 
engineer, he is better because he has a little bit

40:50.144 --> 40:58.315
more education than the average BS graduate. How 
many hours is it take to complete the TAC

40:58.335 --> 41:01.759
engineering program? It's 140 right now. Okay, 
would

41:05.148 --> 41:15.344
you discuss some of the research projects that are 
underway or that have just been completed? Oh,

41:17.026 --> 41:17.387
okay.

41:22.795 --> 41:25.059
I'll discuss areas rather than projects.

41:28.344 --> 41:29.265
We organized the department about three, 
reorganized. Basically, the department about

41:32.001 --> 41:42.577
three years ago was a department with one 
organizational structure, no subunits. And of

41:43.819 --> 41:52.473
course, I fully believe 30 people, good 
management shows you that you can't really

41:43.819 --> 41:52.473
interact with 30 people effectively, and that's 
where we were. And I saw where we were going, too. So

41:54.857 --> 41:56.940
we reorganized into four major areas. And we've 
designated those areas as design, mechanical

41:58.237 --> 42:09.008
systems, thermal science, and materials and 
manufacturing. And it's easier for me to describe

42:09.028 --> 42:16.034
the areas by referring back to these groups or the 
research, because I remember what's going on

42:09.028 --> 42:16.034
there. Starting with the design area, our major 
push right now is in the computer-aided design

42:17.236 --> 42:23.161
area. We have purchased a new computer. We're very 
involved in, we prefer to call it computer-aided

42:28.358 --> 42:39.594
engineering, but we're very involved in 
simulation, in kinematics development as it

42:28.358 --> 42:39.594
relates to robotics. We're involved in

42:39.935 --> 42:49.389
finite elements, structural analysis, fracture 
mechanics.

42:52.874 --> 42:57.100
We do a lot of work relating to oil field problems. a 
major international symposium on piping design

42:57.485 --> 43:01.370
and stress analysis. So those are some of the 
things that that group's involved in. The

43:07.177 --> 43:19.213
mechanical systems group is involved in 
vibrations, acoustics, rotor dynamics,

43:07.177 --> 43:19.213
research in all these areas. We have a substantial 
program going with the Veterans Administration

43:19.293 --> 43:27.323
right now to build devices related to improving 
the utility of handicapped people, to control

43:27.623 --> 43:38.940
systems and let's say robotics-type systems for 
allowing handicapped people to drive

43:27.623 --> 43:38.940
automobiles.

43:42.545 --> 43:54.863
We are involved in some

43:42.545 --> 43:54.863
SEALs work, if this makes sense, relating to very 
high RPM load situations that would typically be

43:55.518 --> 44:00.622
involved. The work came out of the engine for the 
new spacecraft. And so this is very high energy

44:07.869 --> 44:14.995
pumps that require some very basic research in 
what's going on in the seals and the bearings.

44:15.595 --> 44:17.677
We're doing a lot of work in bearing research for 
NASA. We are just getting a brand new NSF project,

44:19.759 --> 44:24.883
which will be starting next month and some very 
basic research in rotor dynamics and instability

44:25.673 --> 44:33.246
problems associated with rotor dynamics. A major 
effort we're making in that group is we're on the

44:33.286 --> 44:38.656
verge of establishing a robotics laboratory. And 
we are doing research in that area now. We

44:43.604 --> 44:50.837
anticipate within a year or two from now we'll be 
one of the major research institutions in the

44:43.604 --> 44:50.837
country, hopefully. In the thermal science area, 
that's the largest as far as the number of people.

44:55.890 --> 44:56.831
It's very diverse. We typically look at it as 
thermal science and thermal systems. Thermal

45:00.877 --> 45:14.698
science, we're doing very basic research in fluid 
mechanics, looking at turbulence, noise

45:00.877 --> 45:14.698
generation from turbulent jets, structure of 
turbulent jets, things of this sort. Over to the

45:15.050 --> 45:30.530
applied area, we've just been designated as one of 
the three research centers by the Air Force Office

45:15.050 --> 45:30.530
of Scientific Research for gas-dynamic gas 
turbine research, ourselves and Purdue and MIT.

45:31.631 --> 45:35.496
And so our gas turbine laboratory is involved in 
this research. We have a very active, large

45:36.437 --> 45:42.525
combustion group that's involved in looking at 
how you use alternate fuels in conventional

45:43.028 --> 45:48.777
converters. In other words, we're looking at 
things like how do you pelletize lignite for

45:48.797 --> 45:56.289
making it useful in fluidized beds. We're looking 
at how to use lignite in diesel engines and gas

45:56.329 --> 46:01.237
turbines. And we work with the petroleum 
engineering department in the in situ

46:01.337 --> 46:07.066
gasification. We're looking at what do you do with 
a gas that's generated from underground

46:07.106 --> 46:10.572
gasification to use it in a gas turbine, to use it in 
a diesel. We're doing, let's see, in combustion

46:15.188 --> 46:25.944
research, we have a fire research lab where we're 
looking at fire research problems associated

46:15.188 --> 46:25.944
with industry. We're also looking at how to use 
combustion as a safe, effective,

46:26.765 --> 46:38.162
environmentally acceptable ways of disposing of 
refuse from, say, oil spills Or oil wells, is this

46:38.480 --> 46:41.063
an acceptable mechanism? We're doing basic 
research in that area. In the materials area, of

46:44.726 --> 46:52.614
course, manufacturing is one of the larger areas

46:44.726 --> 46:52.614
we're pushing. Let me say fundamentally, getting 
off the subject a bit, I perceive that the nation

46:53.575 --> 47:06.968
faces four major technological areas that we need 
to make strides in to

47:07.606 --> 47:13.626
support the goals of society. And the four areas 
are materials. The critical areas are materials.
