00:04.587 --> 00:09.775
Testing,

00:04.587 --> 00:09.775
one, two, three, testing. It looks like it's 
working.

00:16.985 --> 00:19.829
History of College Station, Mr. J.O. White, July 
11, 1983. Mr.

00:23.975 --> 00:29.463
White, where were you born? Kyle Field. Kyle 
Field? Kyle Field, A&M College. Why were you born

00:34.507 --> 00:36.350
on Kyle Field? Because it was an experiment farm 
and it had houses on it. Did your parents work for

00:43.260 --> 00:48.628
the experiment farm? Were you born in the house? In 
the house, yes. Were there any hospitals at that

00:53.455 --> 00:56.339
time that you could have gone to? Midlife

00:56.379 --> 01:01.847
brought me

01:04.612 --> 01:05.693
I don't know who she was. Was that the normal way, 
the kids? Well, yes. The poor people, yes. Myself

01:13.722 --> 01:15.324
and Leroy Davis. He still lives. We were born.

01:22.112 --> 01:27.117
In these houses that were on what is presently Kyle 
Field? On Kyle Field, yes. OK. Where were your

01:29.200 --> 01:30.842
parents from? Sunbury, this county here. They 
were born in Brazos County? Yes, yes. Okay.

01:43.280 --> 01:46.403
Were they associated with the cotton 
plantations? No, my mother was a domestic. And my

01:49.266 --> 01:53.830
father worked at the experiment, you know. What 
did he do at the cotton experiment station? Well,

01:57.694 --> 02:00.657
we would cultivate it, etc., The cotton was 
planted behind the houses, is that right? All

02:04.791 --> 02:05.892
around the houses. And he would go out and 
cultivate the cotton? And did he and other men pick

02:09.756 --> 02:14.301
it, or did they have some other kind of? It was an 
experiment. It was an experiment farm. So they

02:17.765 --> 02:19.967
were just trying out different things. Yes. 
Different insects, et cetera, and all of that. How

02:26.320 --> 02:29.824
long have your relatives lived in this area? Have 
they lived here for a long time? Ever since I've

02:33.708 --> 02:39.655
been launching, I have to remember. I'm 72. Were 
maybe some of your relatives,

02:40.095 --> 02:46.423
great-grandparents, were they slaves on 
plantations that were around here? My

02:46.563 --> 02:47.544
grandmother wasn't. She wasn't? No. What did your 
grandmother do? She wasn't born in this country.

02:53.771 --> 02:54.632
Where was she born? Calcutta, Indiana. Oh, she 
was?

03:01.387 --> 03:02.669
They would decorate their face? No, no, it's in my 
nose and my cheekbones and things. It's not like

03:10.962 --> 03:17.612
the average black person. That's Indian? Is that 
right? That's what I was talking about. So she came

03:24.353 --> 03:27.676
from India to Brazos County? Yes. I don't know 
anything about it. My father was born there. Your

03:33.262 --> 03:34.563
father was born in India? But your mother's family 
had lived here. Did your mother ever talk about

03:40.830 --> 03:46.295
your family extending back before the Civil War? 
On her side? No, not really. But my grandmother,

03:50.620 --> 03:54.023
she would tell me about Her side. She died in early 
30s. She was in the school system over there. In

04:05.624 --> 04:06.124
India?

04:08.767 --> 04:13.652
And she would tell you about... Well, how did she 
come to live in Texas? Well, if I make no mistake, I

04:15.534 --> 04:23.723
believe she told me that

04:15.534 --> 04:23.723
somebody from the States... told them that money 
was growing on trees. And they were referring to

04:30.388 --> 04:34.231
cotton. Did your grandmother know it, that they 
were talking about cotton? No, no, no, no, no. And

04:39.516 --> 04:40.317
so she came? Yes. And did she meet your grandfather 
here? No. No? Oh, from India, I guess. Oh, I see. OK.

04:51.807 --> 04:54.790
OK.

04:57.419 --> 04:59.182
How many brothers and sisters do you have? Are you 
the only one? I've got one half-sister. She lives

05:03.608 --> 05:11.160
in Inwood, Long Island, New York, and I haven't 
seen her since 1945 when I was discharged in New

05:03.608 --> 05:11.160
York. Oh, I bet that's sad, not seeing your... I 
talked with her. Do you? We talked with each other.

05:18.771 --> 05:20.154
Oh, okay. Can you tell me what it was like to grow up? 
Apparently you must have lived on... in this house

05:27.288 --> 05:30.072
on Kyle Field. And can you tell me what it was like to 
grow up on the A&M campus? Well, it was a great life.

05:37.521 --> 05:39.664
It was a great life. I don't know anything about no 
depression. Oh, really? Didn't have... Well, it

05:43.689 --> 05:48.095
was a depression, but I didn't know anything about 
it. I would go to the dining hall and eat. I'd go to

05:51.218 --> 05:52.921
the hospital and eat. I mean, everything was 
plentiful. See, in that day and time, the

05:58.439 --> 06:10.671
Caucasian people, they didn't eat chicken wings, 
chicken livers, chicken necks. They didn't? No.

06:13.634 --> 06:14.995
At least the students didn't. And all of that would 
be put in the garbage, you see. That's terrible.

06:23.544 --> 06:25.746
And my mother's husband would confiscate that and 
save it, and they would take it down to Navasota to

06:27.042 --> 06:34.570
her father.

06:37.453 --> 06:40.977
This was where they could survive during the 
Depression.

06:43.380 --> 06:49.607
So you would take food from the college and take it 
to your folks, your grandparents. Grandparents.

06:53.451 --> 06:54.332
OK. The house that you grew up in, at first, did it 
have electricity? No. What did you use in place of

07:02.334 --> 07:04.456
electricity? A kerosene lamp, an outhouse. You 
had an outhouse. What about water? Well, we had

07:11.903 --> 07:13.144
hydrants.

07:15.946 --> 07:16.687
Did you have to go? There wasn't any running water 
in the house? No. You had to go get it. Outside, yes.

07:22.873 --> 07:23.634
Okay. And days, I don't know. and the largest tin 
tub you could get. You would bathe in that? Yes,

07:32.569 --> 07:35.772
that's what we would bathe in. What did you do? What 
kind of chores did you do when you were growing up?

07:40.696 --> 07:56.550
Well, I found out large enough to have more lawns, 
play with Howard Hughes, Howard Hedge, George

07:40.696 --> 07:56.550
Wren, Bug Mouser, Flop Coulson. These are all boys 
growing up on the campus? White boys. White boys

08:01.842 --> 08:02.703
growing? Bub Malzner.

08:07.090 --> 08:07.611
T.O. Walton. When you say mow lawns, did you mow 
lawns on the A&M campus? With a hand mower, not an

08:14.842 --> 08:18.969
electric mower. Yeah, those are a lot more 
difficult. Where did you go to school? Well, and

08:26.112 --> 08:27.173
Brian. Oh, you went to the elementary school and 
Brian? And high school. And high school there,

08:31.997 --> 08:32.998
too? Used to have to ride a trolley. Some of the 
neighbors you couldn't catch on with. Did the

08:40.085 --> 08:44.208
other boys also go to school there, too? The other 
black boys? Well, the black boys and the boys you

08:45.370 --> 08:48.272
were mentioning just a minute ago? No, they was 
white boys, the one I was mentioning. Right. They

08:51.035 --> 08:53.117
went to consolidated school. Why didn't you go to 
consolidated? A Negro and white wasn't attending

08:54.901 --> 08:58.264
the same school. Was there a Negro school in Bryan 
that you went to? Yes. I see. Oh, okay. There used to

09:04.470 --> 09:08.234
be a Negro school down there by this church. The 
church on the left. There was a Negro school there.

09:13.699 --> 09:15.781
Elementary school. What church? Washington 
Chapel. Oh, really? Right there. When was that,

09:21.226 --> 09:23.629
before you went to school? When was that 
established? Well, I can't say it was

09:26.752 --> 09:31.377
established, but elementary school, that's 
where I went. That's where you went when you were in

09:33.599 --> 09:36.863
elementary school? Mm-hmm. Who sponsored that? 
Was it the county? I imagine so. So right here where

09:43.810 --> 09:47.694
Washington Chapel is, there was a- Just this side 
of Washington Chapel. There was a black

09:47.854 --> 09:50.237
elementary school. And who did it serve? Where did 
the students come from? All over, all up in Boyce

09:54.844 --> 10:03.136
Flat and all up here on the other side of it, on 
Culpeper Plaza. There used to be a lot of black

10:03.196 --> 10:07.603
houses over here. Black families all over on the 
Wildland Road. They all went to that one-room

10:13.311 --> 10:15.955
school. I see. And you were not allowed to go to the 
school, the consolidated school that was started

10:17.760 --> 10:23.225
on the A&M campus? No. Because you were black. So it 
was segregated then. Oh yes, sure. Yes it was. Was

10:31.454 --> 10:35.078
that something that, was it something that 
bothered you then? It didn't bother me because I

10:35.358 --> 10:45.148
was raised around whites all my life and really, I 
really didn't consider myself a You know, I didn't

10:45.449 --> 10:46.851
realize... There was a difference? Other than 
some occasions. Well, it shouldn't be. That's the

10:53.539 --> 10:55.781
way it should be. Because you take Preston Bolden, 
Frank Bolden,

10:55.801 --> 11:13.482
Dean Winkle's boys, and, uh...

10:55.801 --> 11:13.482
Bob Malden.

11:15.875 --> 11:28.511
A.C. Lewis, Billy Lewis, Frank Brown, Jr.

11:15.875 --> 11:28.511
All of those people were Caucasians. I played with 
them.

11:33.638 --> 11:37.463

laundry. Frank Brown, Jr., his daddy was head of

11:39.185 --> 11:45.173

A&M College. Billy and A.C. Lewis, their father

11:46.233 --> 11:52.803

College had.

And John Hubachi,

12:07.546 --> 12:14.957
John Conyer, Edward Hodlicker.

12:21.173 --> 12:22.074
Who are these people? People who lived in the 
community? Yes, they were around. They were

12:26.019 --> 12:30.023
humans, but they were still Caucasian. I went to 
school. I didn't go to school with them. I played

12:33.708 --> 12:36.751
with them all. Came up together. H.W. Holland, his 
father was a foreman on the railroad track. Edward

12:43.539 --> 12:45.501
Hodlicker's father owned the grocery store on 
Welburn Road. Where was that located? On Welburn,

12:51.669 --> 12:54.433
is it located where it is today? Do you know where 
it's located today? You know where Fish Richard's

12:58.819 --> 13:01.964
restaurant is? Oh, no. No. Look here. Going down, 
just opposite the college, there's a cement plant

13:05.329 --> 13:10.937
or something down there. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Just 
opposite of that. Used to be H-R-D-L-Y-C-K-A.

13:19.562 --> 13:20.683
Okay.

13:25.630 --> 13:28.013
Do you feel like that you got an adequate 
education? Yes, I do. Were the teachers that you

13:31.538 --> 13:35.864
had, were they Negro or did you have white 
teachers? They were Negroes. They were? It was the

13:37.106 --> 13:38.588
same? All black.

13:42.603 --> 13:45.446
What did you do if somebody was sick? Where did you 
go if someone in your family was sick? To Dr.

13:48.510 --> 13:49.211
Morris. On the campus. Is that right? Mm. He'll 
wait on you.

14:00.224 --> 14:05.810
OK. OK.

14:00.224 --> 14:05.810
All right. What did?

14:10.160 --> 14:15.827
Was there any kind of a Negro

14:10.160 --> 14:15.827
community? What did the Negro people do for living 
around this area? All worked on A&M College. They

14:23.016 --> 14:23.637
all did? They all worked on A&M? There's a lot of

Pierce.

14:43.167 --> 14:47.552
And others, I can't recall, offhand.

14:50.695 --> 14:54.079
OK. Was there any kind of a group? Did you ever get 
together to do activities together? We used to

14:58.284 --> 15:03.850
play ball right back at Consolidated School when 
it was on the campus. Baseball. Did you play

15:06.113 --> 15:08.776
against other teams? Or just boys getting 
together to play? Other teams. We played against

15:13.863 --> 15:17.368
the wave, going on the campus. They knew all of us. 
They'd come out down here and we'd play ball. And

15:22.916 --> 15:25.320
how important was the church? Was there a church 
that you attended, your family? The Washington

15:28.304 --> 15:29.285
Chapel. Where the school was, near the school? 
What denomination is that? Protestant. It's

15:43.165 --> 15:43.566
Protestant? Oh, black. It is? Oh, it's over there? 
It's still over there?

15:52.923 --> 15:53.163
It's over... I don't know. It's over there. It's 
still over there. Was that pretty important, too?

15:57.948 --> 16:00.370
Did y'all attend church a lot? Oh, yes. My mother 
was quite religious. She used to work for Mrs.

16:04.935 --> 16:12.203
Thomas, Mrs. Bryson,

16:15.136 --> 16:29.772
Mrs. Barrett, Mrs. Jackie Walker, she raised 
Johnny Walker Knox Jr.

16:15.136 --> 16:29.772
And the Mayfields. Apparently on campus there 
were these houses. Did she work for people that

16:37.821 --> 16:40.244
lived on campus? Yes.

16:45.292 --> 16:50.478
Do you remember what it looked like, where the 
houses were located on the campus? Oh, sure. I can

16:51.039 --> 16:55.364
go in there and point out where each house used to 
be. Really? Where is the approximate location?

16:58.448 --> 17:00.710
Can you tell me the approximate location where 
these houses were? Well, by me not being too

17:02.272 --> 17:14.607
familiar with the campus now, all that where the 
Stuluk Center is, houses was there. start at

17:15.802 --> 17:25.637
Wilburn Road, come on up by the stadium, on around, 
just everywhere. The

17:25.657 --> 17:42.923
faculty and some Army personnel, Colonel George 
F. Moore, used to stay opposite Guyon Hall.

17:43.460 --> 17:47.886
Dr. Freps, Dr. J.J. Tobinhouse, A.B. Connor, A. 
Mitchell, M. Mitchell. They stayed up at

17:51.971 --> 17:53.753
Northgate. Were

17:55.015 --> 18:03.846
there houses at Northgate on the campus still or 
across? Yes, on the campus. Still on the campus? Do

18:07.540 --> 18:15.973
you remember when these houses and the house that 
you lived in, do you remember when they were moved

18:07.540 --> 18:15.973
off campus or what happened to them? Well,

18:15.993 --> 18:21.582
I remember but I don't recall the year. Because 
when I left, after I came out of high school, Clark,

18:24.126 --> 18:33.480
Coleson, and his brother Jim and old man Colson, 
they had a triple A building down there, a long

18:34.270 --> 18:47.129
cabin just below Kyle Field before you get off the 
campus. They stayed down there. There was a lot of

18:49.332 --> 18:51.796
trees around there.

18:54.841 --> 19:02.472
The Colson lived just inside on the campus, just 
outside on the campus. Mr. Fleming lived,

19:03.262 --> 19:29.860
I recall his initial, Colonel Todd lived down 
there, Mrs. Todd, Fletcher, Schultz, Littles,

19:03.262 --> 19:29.860
Langfoot, Bryson, Lancaster, McNew,

19:33.940 --> 19:37.463
These are people who lived off campus in the little 
community? Down in? Right across from it? College

19:43.008 --> 19:43.768
Park? Yes, I guess so. But do you remember when the 
houses were moved off or why the houses that were on

19:46.651 --> 19:52.536
campus? No, I wasn't here. You weren't here? I 
wasn't here. When you were growing up, can you

19:58.401 --> 20:03.745
describe what College Station looked like to me? 
Well, it's a very pretty place. All those live oak

20:07.755 --> 20:12.201
trees, I remember when a lot of them was plagued, or 
was planted. And they had the gardeners going

20:13.083 --> 20:16.167
around taking care of them. And Dr. Mostello, E.E. 
McQuillan, and so many others. They stayed right

20:24.679 --> 20:27.603
across from Guyon Hall.

20:31.448 --> 20:32.550
And so many others. J.J. Tubman House. And I just 
can't recall all of the names. Oh, no, you've given

20:38.562 --> 20:40.084
me plenty. Dr.

20:40.105 --> 20:46.634
T.O. Wallen Sr. was a very nice man.

20:54.246 --> 20:56.449
He was all man. He was strict.

21:00.575 --> 21:00.976
T.O. Jr. and myself I remember once

21:02.753 --> 21:13.128
the Aggie was coming from, I believe, SMU or TCU by 
train. They got in around 3 AM. And Teal and I got up

21:16.693 --> 21:29.352
and rode his sister's bicycle, Lily Mae, and his 
bicycle down to the station. And somebody told Dr.

21:30.884 --> 21:35.610
Walden about it. And so we got what was coming to us. 
And you got in trouble, too? Well, sure, I got in

21:39.415 --> 21:43.020
trouble, too. Dr. Morris was one of the kindest 
men. Miss Claygon, she was more mouth than

21:47.746 --> 21:54.455
anything. Gold, had a heart of gold. I used to work 
for Mr. Harry Boyer. Boyer. Yes, Harry Boyer.

22:05.768 --> 22:05.908
Mm-hmm. Joe E. Davis, he's become the king.

22:13.637 --> 22:13.777
Mm-hmm. And Sergeant King, Sergeant B.B. King, 
Sergeant Daniel,

22:17.241 --> 22:22.828
and so many others. Well, when you were growing up, 
what did it look like on this part of the city at

22:24.698 --> 22:31.969
Eastgate? What was this area like? It was 
farmland. All this was farmland. And who owned it,

22:35.454 --> 22:37.918
or who lived here? There

22:38.619 --> 22:44.868
was a black family that lived up on that hill. His 
name was Elmo Ross.

22:50.917 --> 22:52.680
Down here where the light is, That was the vulvas. 
They were for human people. They formed, and it's

22:58.178 --> 23:02.464
plant cotton.

23:05.527 --> 23:09.713
All along here, this... How would you spell vulva?

23:12.376 --> 23:18.964
I believe

23:12.376 --> 23:18.964
it's V-L... vulva. V-L-V-A, I believe. V-L-V-A? 
V-A-L-V-A. Okay, okay. Vulva. So this area was

23:24.267 --> 23:27.891
cotton farmland? Yes, yes. And this was just a 
two-lane gravel road? Right. Okay. What was the

23:33.958 --> 23:37.482
area at, I guess, Southgate like? You mean right 
over here? Right over here. All those houses on the

23:41.346 --> 23:43.589
left point? Uh-huh, uh-huh. Well, Frank Double 
Boy on that, he had rent houses, shotgun rent

23:44.530 --> 23:50.717
houses for blacks. He did? I used to live over 
there. and a lot of others. About what year did he

23:56.145 --> 23:57.707
have those?

24:03.975 --> 24:06.899
30, 39, as far as I remember. Right over here. Right 
over where all these nice homes are.

24:14.730 --> 24:21.860
Going back toward the Kyle Field,

24:14.730 --> 24:21.860
I came back here and a school had been built up 
there. College doing that. Just

24:24.157 --> 24:33.129
the other side of that, Mr. Bill Sparks and Hersha 
Burgess, they developed that. Put in homes. Nice

24:36.854 --> 24:38.035
homes up there. And Mr. Hensley and his brother, 
they built some homes up there right beside the

24:39.597 --> 24:47.628
highway. Mr. Sherrill.

24:53.317 --> 24:58.624
Mr.

24:53.317 --> 24:58.624
Burgess built a big house back there.

25:03.831 --> 25:06.274
And I think Mr. Sparks built a house back there. I 
think so, too. I think I remember reading that. At

25:11.301 --> 25:14.125
Westgate, that was where the train station was. Is 
that right? West... Right, right across from over

25:17.028 --> 25:19.712
there. That's the train station. The creamery 
used to be there.

25:28.612 --> 25:30.915
Do you happen to remember the college zoo?

25:34.120 --> 25:35.903
There was a zoo there in the 20s.

25:38.727 --> 25:42.933
I thought that was interesting that they had a zoo. 
I had read about it. in Dr. Detlof's book. That's

25:49.348 --> 25:50.529
how I had heard about it. Well, I used to go there 
fishing. They called them crappies. Now we call

25:54.534 --> 25:56.176
them white putch. There was a pond? Yes. What about 
at Northgate? Did you have the stores or anything

26:04.446 --> 26:08.291
developed when you were growing up? Mr. Sparks and 
Jeff Casey had a drugstore up there. Dr. Lipscomb

26:16.544 --> 26:22.771
used to work for Mr. Casey and Mr. Spock. He built a 
drugstore across the street. That was Harlech

26:26.655 --> 26:28.217
Boot Shop. Luke and Charlie had a grocery store.

26:34.563 --> 26:40.130
And the Boyds always had on that land up there. 
Youngblood built a tailor shop. cleaning and

26:45.755 --> 26:46.956
pressing shop.

26:50.420 --> 26:54.385
And built a cleaning and pressing shop.

27:05.717 --> 27:07.319
And up there. What was that, a store? Yes, . Men's 
clothing. A.M. Wardrop. And

27:15.451 --> 27:22.919
that's this church up there. I think the minister 
was named Reverend Brown.

27:32.508 --> 27:33.809
But there were very few men. Used to raise cotton 
all out there. You know where the theater is?

27:43.407 --> 27:44.808
Circle Drive, that one? I don't know. It's on 
University Drive.

27:50.796 --> 27:52.778
Back that way, that was the Boyettes. They had 
comedy there. Oh, I know what you're talking

27:55.141 --> 27:56.302
about. Campus Theater, right? That was all 
Boyette land? Yes, Boyette. B-O-Y-E-T-T. I think

28:04.240 --> 28:07.824
you mentioned earlier Boyette Flats, is that 
right? That's Upper Borough where a whole lot of

28:07.924 --> 28:11.227
apartments up there. That was... Going... North? 
Going... Yes, north or west. Okay. There's

28:17.734 --> 28:19.376
apartments now in that area? That's what I 
understand. Is that, was that an area, Boyette

28:21.718 --> 28:24.481
Flats, what was there? Cotton fields or? No. 
Shotgunning out with blacks living in them. In

28:30.227 --> 28:31.328
what years?

28:33.856 --> 28:36.961
Well, this is as long as I can remember up until the 
30s. Oh, really? Because I know a lot of kids were

28:38.403 --> 28:40.827
born up there. Oh, really? So past Northgate area 
and where the apartment complexes are now is an

28:41.749 --> 28:50.543
area that was called Rear Flats. And now we're on 
shotgun houses for black families. And these

28:53.708 --> 28:57.915
black families worked on A&M campus. Right up 
here. Roland Columbus, Albert Pierce, and that

29:02.493 --> 29:09.083
group, another back group. Did they live there? 
They owned that land. Were they cotton farmers?

29:13.289 --> 29:15.913
No, no, worked on campus. Oh, oh, oh. Roland 
Columbus was the second in command to the Lewis

29:17.355 --> 29:26.268
plumbers. The plumbers on campus? Uh-huh. 
Uh-huh, uh-huh. He knew more about the campus

29:31.130 --> 29:34.273
plumbing on the campus than anybody. Lewis was his 
name? No, no. Columbus. Roland Columbus. And he

29:39.599 --> 29:42.903
lived like at University in Texas? No, no. Back 
this way. This first street back here. Oh, wow.

29:46.907 --> 29:47.748
He's got one daughter. She lived over there 
somewhere on College Hills, I think. Somewhere

29:52.333 --> 29:53.034
back there. Well, what I was interested in is Were 
the black people that lived here, the Negro

29:57.995 --> 30:05.004
community that developed, had they lived here for 
a long time in Brazos County? As far as I know. Do you

30:06.927 --> 30:09.811
think maybe they had lived here before the Civil 
War? Probably so. They were treated civilized.

30:14.577 --> 30:21.046
Well, I see along the Brazos River there were 
cotton plantations, and I was wondering maybe if

30:14.577 --> 30:21.046
somewhere... These newcomers came in here. 
Newcomers? Newcomers. From where? off these

30:26.345 --> 30:28.407
farms and plantations. Newcomers referring to? 
They migrated in here, getting better paying

30:31.630 --> 30:37.635
jobs. We had been here all our lives. Well 
newcomers, black or white or both? Black. And they

30:47.444 --> 30:49.827
were coming because of the university to work 
there? Where were they coming from? Down the

30:51.688 --> 30:53.550
bottom. Across the river, out at Rowan Chapel, 
just everywhere. Okay, I was just curious on how

31:00.034 --> 31:08.862
people started living here before A&M, I guess, 
was built. Ever since I've been old enough to

31:08.982 --> 31:15.108
remember, it's been blacks here and all across the 
railroad track. The Henrys used to own the

31:15.148 --> 31:17.050
property over there. They were black. The gays 
owned the property over there. They were black.

31:23.382 --> 31:27.568
down Wilburn Road, the Davises. They were black. I 
didn't know. Maybe had they come here from Africa

31:30.712 --> 31:38.103
or do you know? Just came from parts of America? Do 
you remember the Blue Bonnet Motel? Yes, yes. It

31:48.838 --> 31:50.620
had a blue top. It was a blue top and a blue bonnet. I 
don't remember. I just saw a reference to it, but it

31:53.368 --> 31:56.332
was here. It was right up here on the right. Yes, I 
remember. And that's where people stayed who came

32:01.138 --> 32:05.103
to... White. White people stayed? Yes, black. 
Well, could you really... See, this is something

32:08.988 --> 32:14.275
I'm not familiar with, segregation. Because, you 
know, in the generation I grew up in, there was such

32:15.797 --> 32:20.423
a push... LBJ presidency to make sure that 
everybody was treated equal. But was it something

32:26.598 --> 32:31.867
that was very distinct here, the difference 
between black and white? Not too distinct on the

32:32.307 --> 32:35.793
campus.

32:38.778 --> 32:43.947
Educated people, white people, you have no 
trouble. It's the poor white man that gave you

32:45.732 --> 32:48.235
trouble. Were there poor white men living around 
here that gave you trouble? I never had any

32:54.503 --> 32:55.424
trouble. OK, or gave other? No, it wasn't too much 
trouble we had. Everybody got along like brothers

33:01.052 --> 33:05.197
and sisters. They'd know each other. And that was 
just it. It wasn't any trouble. There was no

33:09.563 --> 33:15.250
fighting that I can recall, or no arguments that I 
can recall. amongst the races.

33:20.762 --> 33:26.848
But basically, the trouble comes in when you have 
the poor white class living with the black. There

33:27.349 --> 33:30.312
was some poor whites lived on the campus then. 
Don't get me wrong. All I want are professors and

33:32.755 --> 33:36.819
things. And they would say some snotty things,

33:36.839 --> 33:42.966
but that's life. Some of them say it now. That's 
probably true. What was the transportation like?

33:50.843 --> 33:52.386
You were talking about the trolley. You would take 
the trolley to school and back each day? Oh yes, I

33:56.792 --> 33:59.236
went by the nickel and dime. Where did you get on it 
and where did it take you? I went by the hospital.

34:04.684 --> 34:05.826
The old hospital? And it would take you? On 26th 
Street and And you could walk to school from there?

34:20.892 --> 34:20.972
Yes. Was your high school also segregated? Was it 
all a black school? Yes. Okay.

34:33.849 --> 34:41.059
Since you lived on campus, this is, you basically 
ate dinner at On campus, I mean, did your parents

34:41.663 --> 34:45.688
bring food to the home and cook it there? Well, my 
mother was a domestic, and if she didn't bring it

34:45.748 --> 34:54.160
from her job, I could go to the dining hall and eat. I 
could go to the hospital and eat, because the

34:54.180 --> 34:59.567
people knew me. And basically, she worked with 
people who lived on campus. Is that right? Ms.

35:06.076 --> 35:07.958
Bryson, Ms. Billson. Wankler, just all of those 
people. When did you and your family move off

35:12.835 --> 35:15.998
campus?

35:29.331 --> 35:31.733
Late 20s, early 20s. Where were you going? We moved 
over there in the Devil's Corner. Oh, okay. The

35:40.023 --> 35:41.485
place that you were just talking about? And why 
were you, why did y'all move? Was it, were the

35:44.448 --> 35:48.872
people, was every, were everybody moving off 
then? No, wasn't everybody? These houses were

35:49.773 --> 35:51.535
just torn down.

35:54.478 --> 35:57.200
Was your mother and father still working on campus 
though? My mother, she was domestic. She had

35:59.443 --> 36:00.404
remarried. She and my father, I don't even much 
remember my mother and father being together. But

36:05.414 --> 36:08.057
she was still working on campus. Yeah, she was 
working. Jackie Walker, Howard Bryson, Mr.

36:09.740 --> 36:20.834
Brayton,

36:09.740 --> 36:20.834
Mayfield. Are you familiar with the Lincoln area, 
Lincoln School area? No? Because there's a lot of

36:26.521 --> 36:33.571
black people that live there today, and I was 
curious as to, you know where Lincoln School is? I

36:33.591 --> 36:34.712
don't know about that. It's going down Wellburn. I 
really guess I can't explain it as to where it

36:36.915 --> 36:42.783
really is. But do you know where Fairview Street 
is? No. Oh, OK. I thought maybe you would. Did you

36:53.597 --> 36:56.020
hear of a community called Spring Green? No. OK. 
You may not have been in College Station at this

37:01.169 --> 37:08.378
time, but do you remember when College Station was 
incorporated into a city?

37:11.543 --> 37:18.292
Not really, but I remember the first mail College 
Station had. That was? My white daddy, Ernest

37:20.094 --> 37:23.038
Langford. Why do you call him your white daddy? 
Because I was just like a child of his, I told you.

37:30.768 --> 37:32.831
It's because of me getting a college education. 
How did he do that? Well, because everybody on

37:36.216 --> 37:55.425
campus knew me, and Mr. Tony Harrington, Mr. 
Fleming, Mr. Charlie Crawford, and numerous

37:36.216 --> 37:55.425
others contributed so much money.

38:00.721 --> 38:19.043
And

38:00.721 --> 38:19.043
after I got my education, I sent the money back from 
San Francisco, and he distributed to each person

38:00.721 --> 38:19.043
the amount that they contributed. Where did you go 
to school? A&M or somewhere else? No, no. I went to

38:23.508 --> 38:24.609
school in California. You went to school in 
California? No, college. What degree did you get?

38:28.666 --> 38:31.789
Well, I got a little old piece of paper. I measured 
in business administration. But Mr. Lankford was

38:37.174 --> 38:41.478
responsible for providing... He was 
responsible. He was responsible. For providing

38:43.740 --> 38:46.983
the money, and he got it from these group of men? I 
went around and talked to each individual myself

38:47.003 --> 38:56.732
and told them what I wanted, asked if they would 
help, and they did. And once you got your job, you

38:58.113 --> 39:01.656
sent back the money to these people? Yeah, I sent it 
to my white dad, and he gave me that money back.

39:06.781 --> 39:07.642
That's wonderful. I was able to talk to Mr. 
Crawford, too. Charlie Crawford? Mm-hmm. He's a

39:13.187 --> 39:13.967
fine man. He has a mechanical engine. That's 
right. That's right. He's a very nice person. And

39:21.454 --> 39:27.600
J.T.L. Mackney. I knew him personally. His son is a 
doctor. I haven't seen Buddy since he was a little

39:31.520 --> 39:33.482
boy. But his sister, he's got a sister who lives in 
Oakland, California. Her name is Elizabeth. I've

39:42.592 --> 39:43.833
been to her home. Her husband and I work with the 
same company, Standard Oil Company of

39:44.834 --> 39:50.300
California. His name is Little. I went to see her 
and I've been to her home and seen her kids. Is that

39:58.205 --> 39:58.746
right? That's wonderful. Anyway, I guess, were 
you here when College Station became a town? Do you

40:09.839 --> 40:12.342
remember that?

40:13.904 --> 40:16.066
Well, yes, I was. I mean, it wasn't just, you know, 
just being a boy at a store up there. That was years

40:24.436 --> 40:26.018
and years ago. Where was Boyett's store? Right 
along in there where, I don't know what's there

40:29.547 --> 40:33.010
now. At Northgate? Up there. Yes, at Northgate by 
the post office, sort of down to the right. He had a

40:41.139 --> 40:41.980
store? Boyett's store. Do you remember anything, 
any rivalry between Brian and College Station?

40:54.533 --> 40:56.815
What are you referring to, Riley? Well, Bryan, I 
believe, wanted to incorporate College Station

40:57.082 --> 41:04.312
into their own town. He did. And College Station 
wanted to be its own town. They wanted to be College

41:07.877 --> 41:09.278
Station. Do you know why? Why they'd rather not? 
Well, to my idea, I think College Station is more

41:11.882 --> 41:20.714
sophisticated than the peoples in Bryan. They 
know they've got to educate most educated peoples

41:20.734 --> 41:26.802
here than they have in Bryan. And so they wanted to 
be counted as one instead of two, you know. College

41:35.395 --> 41:37.758
Station, College Station, Brian's one. Because 
if it wasn't College Station, there wouldn't have

41:38.419 --> 41:42.886
been any Brian. Brian didn't have no industry. 
Nothing but, well, farmers bringing their cotton

41:45.329 --> 41:49.415
in there. And College Station, look what they was 
doing. That's right. College helped Brian. Is

41:56.145 --> 41:56.586
that right? Supported Brian. Because you see, at 
the laundry, maybe 100 black women were working

41:59.280 --> 42:18.330
there and some white, but they was getting $45 a 
month, five days a week. The janitors, those

42:18.350 --> 42:22.236
fellows there, they was getting $45 a month. I see. 
So the college was supporting these people and

42:26.112 --> 42:30.897
providing them an occupation? They were living in 
Brown. They were? A lot of these people? All of

42:34.541 --> 42:35.462
them. All of them. This man here wasn't, and this 
one wasn't. But all the rest of these people were

42:43.630 --> 42:46.433
living in Weldon or Bryant.

42:49.175 --> 42:51.097
So the college did support them then? Right. And 
I've seen the time. During the summer when school

42:53.502 --> 43:00.790
was out, they'd have those big vats. You know what a 
bed bug is?

43:06.396 --> 43:07.457
It was just that bad. They'd have to dip all of those 
bugs in that creosote or whatever it was to kill

43:07.477 --> 43:14.565
those bed bugs. Changes. What are you talking 
about? The cotton? No. The springs. You see, the

43:24.772 --> 43:26.734
books have springs on them. Oh, you're talking 
about the beds that are on campus in the dorms? Yes.

43:31.380 --> 43:31.921
Oh, I see. They would have to, during the 
summertime, put them in? Oh, yeah. You turn the

43:38.088 --> 43:41.032
light on, they line up like soldiers. That would 
have been pretty. You're saying that the beds in

43:44.516 --> 43:48.041
the dorms were like that? That's the old A&M 
College. And so you would treat him each summer, is

43:49.342 --> 43:54.171
that right? Yes, we do. Okay, just a second.
