WEBVTT

00:02.495 --> 00:31.506
little concerned about the professionalism 
about about your colleague uh... you know all

00:02.495 --> 00:31.506
we're still in business to make money to make a 
living and so a certain amount of competition is

00:02.495 --> 00:31.506
good for everybody but some of the things that are 
happening are are you know not very uh... i think

00:02.495 --> 00:31.506
they're dragging us down in our own eyes even yeah 
and that's the bad part what you're saying is we've

00:02.495 --> 00:31.506
met the enemy and he is us it's not what the public 
perceives us as much as it is what we perceive

00:02.495 --> 00:31.506
ourselves Don't you think we've met the enemy and 
he's us? Oh, yeah. No question. That's a good

00:38.136 --> 00:39.258
point. I'm serious. There's no question about 
that. But we had no course addressed to

00:41.962 --> 00:46.649
jurisprudence. Well, we had one course. They had a 
one-hour course, veterinary jurisprudence, and

00:47.551 --> 00:52.519
it was neat. It gave you just a little smattering of 
legality with veterinary medicine. We had

00:57.687 --> 00:58.047
nothing. And they had nothing. Did you have 
anything, Tom? No. When I came back here, he only

01:00.241 --> 01:05.486
had a jurisprudence test. Oh, he just retired, 
just died. Just died, yeah. Stewart. Judge

01:10.471 --> 01:11.292
Stewart. In College Station. He was an attorney 
that taught the one-hour veterinary

01:13.074 --> 01:17.759
jurisprudence court. I'll tell you, students are 
going to need it now. Oh, boy. And they are. It's a

01:23.605 --> 01:24.746
different world out there. It really is. It really 
is. Like I said, we were too busy working to be good

01:27.359 --> 01:30.562
businessmen. You know, we did business courses 
and jurisprudence courses and more. Well, and the

01:35.287 --> 01:40.912
other thing that's happening in this whole thing, 
the other thing that's happening in this whole

01:35.287 --> 01:40.912
thing. Has been real helpful to us in animal 
control. He comes and gives us, yeah, he's done a

01:43.234 --> 01:46.157
lot. Oh, he has a manuscript about like this of 
different cases that have come up involving

01:46.277 --> 01:55.206
animals, crime, and so forth. No, I'm just sitting 
here thinking, you know, about 12 of the

01:55.473 --> 02:02.582
veterinarians that were here when we first came. 
Only three of them are even here, or even alive.

02:07.688 --> 02:12.655
Well, there was Wharton, there was Walt Lawrence, 
there was Al Nagel, Charlie Neal, Richard

02:07.688 --> 02:12.655
Culpepper, R.D. Brown, Gerald Parker, Harry 
Fladigal, Ray, Johnny McCannish, Pinky Houser,

02:12.715 --> 02:19.904
Charlie Neal. And all that's left is Al. R.D., 
Gerald, you and me. You know that R.D. and Gerald

02:25.284 --> 02:26.665
are both in the hospital. Are they really? R.D. and 
Gerald, both? R.D.' 's just getting his diabetes

02:30.831 --> 02:32.893
stabilized. They've been there over a week, 
though. And Gerald, they rushed him in the middle

02:35.316 --> 02:39.782
of the morning, in the wee hours. He passed out 
completely. They think it's enough. That's

02:45.409 --> 02:46.190
right. Well, no, Jim came after him. Where was Jim 
Saunders? No, he graduated. He graduated in 41.

02:53.765 --> 02:54.445
Yeah, he was. Was he in San Antonio? Was he in San 
Antonio at that time? He came in 56. See, that's the

03:01.892 --> 03:03.734
reason. You know, one of the other things that is 
happening today that has affected me in a case is

03:03.774 --> 03:20.188
that veterinarians now, a lot of the younger 
veterinarians they're getting out, And again, in

03:20.523 --> 03:34.677
their zeal, I think, probably to be successful, 
are not using the wisdom that they should use about

03:20.523 --> 03:34.677
commenting on other veterinarians' treatments. 
And I had somebody that said something to a client

03:34.837 --> 03:37.540
of mine. I've been through a hearing for the state 
board. I'm still probably going to end up in a

03:40.783 --> 03:45.067
malpractice suit. The board has fouled me. And 
it's because these people talked to some

03:46.291 --> 03:57.887
veterinarian somewhere that said something, 
took it out of context, and made an open comment

03:46.291 --> 03:57.887
about something without knowing the whole story. 
And this guy, even though the state board has told

03:58.348 --> 04:07.401
him that I didn't do anything wrong medically or 
otherwise, he's still convinced I killed his cat,

03:58.348 --> 04:07.401
you know, because of what some other veterinarian 
said. And, boy, that just never happened. It used

04:10.104 --> 04:10.986
to happen at all. It never did in the past. But it's 
going to happen in more and more frequency. Oh, it

04:15.532 --> 04:16.213
has happened. I think that we need to be more aware 
of our fellow. I've always adopted the idea and

04:20.762 --> 04:29.715
lived with the fact that if I'm a liar, I'm 
reminding myself. That's right. My dad told me a

04:31.738 --> 04:36.365
long time ago, if you can't point one finger, 
somebody else will point three at you. Well, it's

04:36.545 --> 04:40.911
changed like everything's changed. No, it 
hasn't. No, people have. People have changed.

04:46.214 --> 04:47.075
Yeah. Individual priorities and so on. 
Responsibilities. Ethics. Well, okay. But we

04:56.250 --> 05:00.517
have the same thing in a classic example is what we 
have over there in animal control. Complete lack

05:00.897 --> 05:03.321
of owner responsibility. Yeah. Guy comes in, he 
says, I want to post bail for my dog. Which dog is

05:08.890 --> 05:09.912
yours? They bring it down. Is your dog vaccinated? 
No. No. Well, law, state law, city ordinance says

05:14.058 --> 05:17.142
it has to be vaccinated. Was your dog in his own 
yard? Well, no, you picked him up in the street. And

05:21.306 --> 05:22.628
then it's my fault? I know. He gets really hostile. 
I say, you know, you really need to put a tag on this

05:25.872 --> 05:39.247
animal or tattoo him or something because I've 
been here almost 14 years and I've never had a dog or

05:25.872 --> 05:39.247
a cat give me his own phone. I'm serious. And we need 
to tell our clients this. No, when we came back,

05:44.348 --> 05:47.553
when we took state boards. I never thought about 
it. You've made me feel older now. Rabies was an

05:51.419 --> 05:53.181
everyday occurrence. Yeah, right. That's true. 
Oh, we had tremendous rabies here. Oh, yeah, it

05:58.690 --> 05:59.912
really was. That's right. When I came here in 57, 
this was the rabies capital of the world. But this

06:06.822 --> 06:10.187
was in domestic animals, wasn't it? It was dogs and 
cats. That's right. But now it's in skunks, bats,

06:14.985 --> 06:20.232
foxes, raccoons, very little in dogs. I mean we've 
come full circle there again. It seems to be going

06:25.940 --> 06:34.892
back because you're seeing more domestic animals 
coming out now. And also we're immunizing fewer

06:35.024 --> 06:41.971
and fewer, a smaller percentage of our pet 
population. You know, I think historically

06:41.991 --> 06:48.118
that's as public awareness drops and the threat 
drops. It's happened with measles in kids. Yeah,

06:49.439 --> 06:50.340
that's right. Then the number of unvaccinated 
animals goes up and you get a susceptible

06:50.360 --> 06:57.307
population and then the scare comes. The polio in 
the same way. Yeah. Yeah, it's cycling. And these

07:00.543 --> 07:02.246
things should be a thing of the past. Hooping 
coughs should be a thing of the past. Diphtheria

07:04.130 --> 07:06.354
should be a thing of the past. Yeah, but they won't 
be. It makes me wonder, you know, are we going to

07:09.059 --> 07:12.024
have smallpox again? How many of these immigrants 
coming in here? What in the world are they bringing

07:14.549 --> 07:16.312
in? I know, it makes me shudder. I've been writing 
my congressman since I came from Mexico about it.

07:22.004 --> 07:24.086
some of these things. It's going to fall on deaf 
ears. We're going to bring all the Salvadorans in

07:25.748 --> 07:28.131
here. I mean, they need help, and we can take care of 
them. They ought to be trying for trees. Well, I'm

07:33.176 --> 07:41.365
taking a lot of your time, but let me give you each 
one, if you like, a last opportunity to comment.

07:41.705 --> 07:45.269
Well, I was going to tell you what all I had done. You 
got married, of course, had a litter of kids. I was

07:49.510 --> 07:52.775
in small animal practice from about 48 to 75. 
That's small animal surgery, dentistry, the

07:53.997 --> 07:56.921
whole nine yards. We had a Newcastle disease 
outbreak about that time, if you recall. And it

08:00.987 --> 08:05.133
just wiped out the chicken population around. 
When about 61, 62, somewhere around in there, got

08:07.556 --> 08:13.845
involved in pigeons. My dad used to fly pigeons. 
and made contact with a friend of his. They flew

08:22.259 --> 08:24.743
pigeons together before either one of them was 
married. And so I kind of allied myself with him. He

08:28.749 --> 08:35.158
was, well, Eddie Hemsworth and Pat Zachary. Got to 
working a lot with pigeon parasites. The foremost

08:39.525 --> 08:44.813
of which was his Tetrameres Americana, which just 
wipes them out. When birds are called upon to

08:45.434 --> 09:05.518
really race a long, hard race, they just can't cut 
it, because their glandular stomach, their

08:45.434 --> 09:05.518
polentriculus, just looks like it's been shot 
with a shotgun, with these little encased females

08:45.434 --> 09:05.518
that burrow into the... And they do lay eggs, and 
you can demonstrate them on fecals. And so I was

09:06.022 --> 09:12.051
doing a lot of this because these guys were 
bringing in birds, paying maybe $500, $1,000 a

09:06.022 --> 09:12.051
bird. I saw some, yeah. Did this also lead to other 
cage birds? Well, I did a lot of surgery on birds and

09:19.062 --> 09:26.133
did a lot of sterility work on birds. These guys 
would say, you know, well... They'd bring me this

09:29.242 --> 09:30.483
hen. This hen feels like she's normal. Oh, she lays 
eggs, but they don't hatch. Hey, mister, you're

09:34.367 --> 09:36.469
going after the wrong bird. Let's check, you know. 
And I used my little hormonal situation. And I was

09:44.176 --> 09:49.401
known as rejuvenating all these old birds. I mean, 
just enough to get maybe six or eight youngsters

09:49.421 --> 09:54.105
out of them. And man, then they're happy.

09:58.329 --> 09:59.130
Well.

10:01.642 --> 10:05.585
Did that sustain the pigeon work? Was that a 
sustained practice? It was over a long period of

10:07.047 --> 10:13.372
time, yeah, until, well, about 1975. Well, I was 
still doing it when I went to work for the city, but

10:13.392 --> 10:19.818
not on the biggest scale, because you have to train 
these birds constantly and drive them. But I'd

10:21.159 --> 10:26.944
worked with Leon Whitney, who was another Auburn 
graduate. He had the Huskins Van Rails up in

10:26.964 --> 10:31.648
Orange, Connecticut. And he and I had done some 
work together. I mean, I'd done some

10:35.098 --> 10:51.222
consultantships and gone and talked to various 
pigeon groups in

10:35.098 --> 10:51.222
South Carolina and also here in California, 
outside of Ventura. And then when I got involved in

10:51.242 --> 11:00.876
animal control, and by the way, animal control 
veterinarians are still somewhat of an oddity.

11:01.278 --> 11:02.620
Don't find too many of them. Well, with the advent 
of a lot of the humane laws and stuff like that,

11:02.700 --> 11:12.294
they're becoming a little more common today than 
they used to be. Well, I have a couple of them in

11:12.314 --> 11:14.137
Houston.

11:17.161 --> 11:20.786
They have an animal control veterinarian in 
Dallas. However, he's not administrating.

11:27.156 --> 11:27.256
Yeah. I guess Ed Beckham out of Dallas And, uh, Will 
Builderback wasn't, um, Lee Hutchison from El

11:30.404 --> 11:36.535
Paso. Bob Ward, who was from Houston. Same thing 
in, in research with the, with the humane laws and

11:40.341 --> 11:44.969
stuff like that. Now there's, you know, you, 
that's the reason I'm still a consultant

11:45.029 --> 11:49.196
attorney. They have very few animals down there, 
but they do use a few in teaching and research, and

11:49.217 --> 11:55.888
so they have to have a veterinarian on there. on 
their animal control committee or their animal

11:56.543 --> 12:01.068
committee. Or they can't get any teaching, 
national NIH teaching funds or research funds or

12:01.088 --> 12:07.574
anything. I'll tell you where we need a 
veterinarian. Excuse me. Go ahead. Well, I've had

12:12.239 --> 12:15.102
a lot to do with parks and wildlife. I've been on a 
trip with them to Baja, Mexico eight or nine years

12:15.122 --> 12:20.407
ago to capture some desert bighorn. We shot them 
with a helicopter. Somebody just pulled another

12:22.770 --> 12:24.812
boo-boo up there. director it seemed like for some 
of these wealthy gentlemen. They just had 40 sheep

12:30.007 --> 12:38.379
or something put on a ranch and 39 of them died. And 
Gibb Lewis is the Speaker's ranch, yeah. Those

12:41.184 --> 12:52.420
people who make the decisions are usually the guy 
up here and he doesn't even consult because I went

12:41.184 --> 12:52.420
to Baja with him and I talked to, I was one of the two 
that were not represented and the governor

12:41.184 --> 12:52.420
appoints them. It's too much politics instead of 
efficiency and animal husbandry and veterinary

12:53.108 --> 12:59.256
medicine. It's sad when you see the results. Yeah, 
Parks and Wildlife really should have a

13:00.418 --> 13:03.742
veterinary consultant. They should have a 
full-time veterinary. Or a consultant, at least,

13:05.484 --> 13:07.767
to the department. Well, to cover their 
backsides. I wrote them. We had a thing from New

13:10.190 --> 13:12.353
Mexico. They had done the same thing Texas did 
years ago. And I told them, I said, you're going to

13:14.937 --> 13:17.540
Mexico. I had lived in Mexico. And they wouldn't 
listen. And they wouldn't listen to their field

13:20.464 --> 13:21.826
then. We lost... I told them you'd be lucky to get 
back with half of them. You're going to stress

13:25.190 --> 13:25.991
them. We got back with about half of them. Now, this 
is another example of poor consultation or

13:27.613 --> 13:32.940
somebody that they should have listened to. And 
some of their own staff even told them. I don't

13:37.725 --> 13:44.033
understand that. They need someone all the time to 
put on that board. They should have one. Yeah. I

13:50.028 --> 13:53.713
talked to Silber and wrote... At least in a 
consulting capacity. Here a few years ago, and the

13:55.175 --> 14:01.763
director wrote me a letter, and it was very nice 
about it. But still, they don't have a man to

14:01.783 --> 14:05.468
consult with on everything. I mean, you get some 
variety, some versatility, you get more

14:05.488 --> 14:08.893
efficiency. You've got to have a veteran out 
there. They have, what's his name, an A&M? A

14:13.219 --> 14:18.365
parasitologist that used to do a lot of work for 
parts of my life. Grimes? Burley. No,

14:19.913 --> 14:33.594
since I've been in animal control, I've, of 
course, in the state association and also in the

14:19.913 --> 14:33.594
national association, served on executive 
boards and this, this, and this. The

14:33.614 --> 14:43.429
veterinarians that are involved in that do not 
accept any elected position except in an advisory

14:33.614 --> 14:43.429
capacity for obvious reasons. That's where I met 
Ed Beckham and some of the others. But I've served

14:47.842 --> 15:00.878
as a consultant to the UN Development Program of 
PAHO and, well, Pan American Health

14:47.842 --> 15:00.878
Organization, World Health Organization down in 
Barbados with the Ministry of Health down there.

15:00.898 --> 15:02.880
I've been down there four times. Designed their 
euthanasia equipment. Went back to check on it and

15:07.526 --> 15:14.254
then went back four years ago on this to evaluate 
the overall program again. What is their problem?

15:17.619 --> 15:18.340
Cats, dogs? Loose dogs. Incidentally, I don't 
know if any of you know, but you might want to

15:21.803 --> 15:28.668
support Hawaii in the Humane Society, Hawaiian 
Humane. Some veterinarian over there didn't like

15:29.870 --> 15:39.378
the idea of having to quarantine a dog for four 
months, and they're attempting to rescind that

15:29.870 --> 15:39.378
law. I know the state veterinarian, but while 
you're there, a little personal, there's a cow in

15:39.638 --> 15:43.541
the lung. Is that him? He's a state governor. He's 
active in the A's. No, this is a woman who took her

15:48.671 --> 15:55.059
dog and didn't want to leave the quarantine. But 
she tried challenging it in the court system?

15:58.583 --> 16:05.130
Yeah, has gone to pass or has presented a bill to 
rescind the quarantine. Oh, in the state

16:05.150 --> 16:06.091
legislature. In the state of Hawaii, yeah. 
Because that would be suicide, for God's sake. I

16:11.998 --> 16:14.741
mean, can you imagine if they ever got rapists in 
the mongoose? Yeah. I mean, they're such

16:16.013 --> 16:18.856
wonderful little animals in the first place. No, 
but Barbados had a problem with dogs, just loose

16:19.236 --> 16:23.179
dogs. The same as, hey, it's international, the 
irresponsible pet owner. I mean, the dogs that are

16:27.884 --> 16:30.006
running loose are not strays. They're owned, 
unvaccinated, free-roaming dogs. I mean,

16:33.949 --> 16:34.970
they've proven that. These dogs will jump up on a 
55-gallon drum and jump and jump until they tip it

16:37.673 --> 16:44.238
over, and then screw the garbage. And, of course, 
then you have rats. So we were down there on dog

16:46.490 --> 16:52.418
control and rat eradication. That's where I met 
Rex

16:52.438 --> 16:58.987
from UCAL Davis, Rex Marsh. And that's another 
Rex, UCAL Davis. All I see, we do a consultant work

17:04.815 --> 17:12.666
in animal control, go to various cities and 
troubleshoot their euthanasia units and stuff.

17:13.051 --> 17:16.358
We try awfully hard to acquaint people with the 
problem. I mean, PTAs, Rotary Club, Optimist

17:16.378 --> 17:23.494
Club, the TVMA. Tim Long had one of our ACOs down at 
the convention center when we had the conference

17:23.514 --> 17:32.072
here several years ago. All our ammo control 
officers in San Antonio are now currently

17:32.812 --> 17:46.953
certified by the state as basic ammo control 
officers, some of them in advanced and some of them

17:32.812 --> 17:46.953
in the administrative capacity, and some of them 
actually in the instructions. At lunch with

17:46.973 --> 17:51.079
Catherine Tull, that's why we turned on to this 
ammo control bit again. So what we're trying to do

17:53.522 --> 17:59.511
is teach kids the responsibility. I'm giving up on 
the adults. I mean, people our age know what the

18:01.629 --> 18:03.951
problem is. They don't have any experience with 
animals. That's right. They get an animal because

18:10.258 --> 18:15.644
the kid pitches it in the mall and they see these 
precious little puppies. Okay, we get a little

18:15.664 --> 18:17.827
puppy and we take it home. Forget about the 
responsibility. Well, you know, the Humane

18:21.170 --> 18:25.515
Movement has missed the boat for all the years it's 
been in existence. You know, they've tried to deal

18:27.900 --> 18:33.185
with a problem that was beyond their capability. I 
figure you just look at it locally, nationally,

18:33.285 --> 18:41.793
and have not attacked the problem from the 
standpoint of humane education, starting with

18:33.285 --> 18:41.793
the kids. And that's where it has to start. You 
know, they've spent millions and millions of

18:44.755 --> 18:53.123
dollars trying to find homes for 20% of the dogs and 
cats that are homeless. Instead of educating

18:53.288 --> 19:07.349
children to try to develop curricula that could be 
part of every school's curriculum in these kids

18:53.288 --> 19:07.349
and develop a humane education. Well, you know, a 
pet is a special friend. If they'd done that 25

19:08.791 --> 19:14.760
years ago, we wouldn't have the problem we have 
today, certainly on the magnitude of it. I mean, I

19:15.741 --> 19:19.086
think we've reached a state of apathy. And the next 
step is back into bondage. We live in a disposable

19:22.415 --> 19:24.337
society. I keep saying we don't make commitments 
to ourselves. If we did, we'd take better care of

19:28.483 --> 19:30.565
our bodies. We wouldn't be overweight, drunk, 
smoking, all this stuff. We don't make

19:33.328 --> 19:36.352
commitments to our spouses or to our children. Why 
wouldn't we make a commitment to an animal? You're

19:38.555 --> 19:38.975
right. That's a good point. I got a baby bird that 
had my office a little... One week old African gray

19:43.812 --> 19:46.355
parrot that has to be fed. We deal an awful lot with 
zoonoses. Boy, you've got to get his 4 o'clock

19:48.338 --> 19:50.140
feeding. I mean, I laugh at everything. You're 
cold today, aren't you? Yeah, I've got to take him

19:52.963 --> 19:54.705
home with me tonight. Everything from Lyme 
disease to Giardia. Oh, you did. I resurrected him

19:57.389 --> 20:02.535
from the dead this morning, so I don't want him to 
die. Enjoyed it. It was kind of fun sitting around

20:03.476 --> 20:05.779
and talking about it all. That's why you up there in 
Pennsylvania, you've got some Amish plants. My

20:08.502 --> 20:09.904
oldest boy is a veteran in Pennsylvania. And he 
gets so mad because they won't treat him anymore on

20:10.373 --> 20:12.836
Sunday. And some of them have got to have treatment 
on Sunday. I know some veterinarians about that.

20:20.146 --> 20:21.467
Good to see you, Tom. See you later.

20:25.613 --> 20:26.213
Oh, goodness.

20:29.017 --> 20:32.361
That's a good point about the homeless animal was 
not the point. See if I can get a copy of that article

20:32.421 --> 20:39.030
that, what was it, Hutton did in the Express last 
July. on animal control. Yeah, if you can throw it

20:41.852 --> 20:46.259
up bits and pieces that I can get from you, that 
would really be helpful. Because the

20:46.279 --> 20:47.661
conversation is very good. Documentation is, of 
course, going to help a lot. Yeah. But that's the

20:51.186 --> 20:55.212
basic, you know, we want everything, but they 
don't want the responsibility. That is true in so

20:55.232 --> 20:58.997
many things nowadays. Anyhow, if you ever get 
fecal contamination and get a Giardia infection,

20:59.017 --> 21:06.528
get some medication fast. Bill McCulloch got it 
from the shelter up there, Brazos County Animal

21:08.457 --> 21:11.821
Shelter. He's over there, he's anitizing dogs. We 
walk in the kennel in the morning, you know, and

21:16.507 --> 21:27.841
they hit the fence like this, and they puddled and 
spilled their water and defecated in it, and they

21:16.507 --> 21:27.841
hit like this, you know, and you're giving it this, 
and your glasses. Well, I ended up with Giardia,

21:28.822 --> 21:31.726
and I trained myself for about a week. Don't do it. I 
finally went to the doctor. He won't put me in the

21:33.708 --> 21:36.912
hospital.

21:38.292 --> 21:44.901
We did some work with the screw worm problem when we 
had animals come in to the facility. Every once in a

21:46.003 --> 21:49.488
while I'd run into one that was screw worm 
positive. I sent Bucuzum down to mission and I sent

21:49.508 --> 22:07.152
a lot of ticks to the lab in Austin and we know that 
the Lyme disease organism is present in our derma

21:49.508 --> 22:07.152
center and Reprocephalus sanguineus, our good 
old And then the Lone Star, too, we've identified.

22:12.347 --> 22:18.733
There's going to be a Lyme conference for the 
benefit of anybody who's interested in Austin in

22:12.347 --> 22:18.733
May, 4 and 5. That's something that's really right 
on the leading edge of concern right now, the Lyme.

22:23.937 --> 22:32.765
Well, Wiley Tanner, public health veterinarian, 
was in Austin out of Arlington, had it several

22:23.937 --> 22:32.765
years ago. He's retired now and moved to Colorado. 
And I've had this, I guess, for five years now. To

22:42.936 --> 22:45.958
the point now that this eye has deteriorated. I 
mean, it just doesn't work by itself. Is that from

22:49.742 --> 22:50.642
Lyme disease? Apparently, that's what Dr. 
Schwarting said the other day. And my husband's

22:54.346 --> 22:56.488
pushing me to retire. I don't know what's down the 
road for me with this mess, you know? Are there

23:02.793 --> 23:03.654
other cases? You know, this is another whole area 
of... veterinary, you know, the animal bond

23:06.312 --> 23:10.717
relationship. That is the transmission of 
disease that people are not aware of. Other than

23:15.302 --> 23:17.204
rabies, things like that, we know now. Well, you 
try to tell them about T. canis in children, and

23:17.464 --> 23:23.391
they look like you're, you know, they're out of 
your mind. And yet, out at the medical school,

23:24.252 --> 23:29.918
pediatrics will tell you, yeah, we got a problem. 
And the physicians and the veterinarians, no, we

23:29.938 --> 23:34.283
don't have problems. It's a problem with that more 
than we do. I mean, these little blind kids that run

23:35.962 --> 23:46.374
around, I have a great niece that I'm sure they 
removed her eyes, thought she had

23:35.962 --> 23:46.374
retinoblastoma. I don't think she had 
retinoblastoma at all. She ditched that problem

23:49.237 --> 23:50.859
with the other eye. I think she had ticanus, 
visceral larval migraines. And hey, down on the

23:55.284 --> 24:01.311
beach, that's one of the big things in Barbados, 
because they're telling them, Well, you just bury

24:01.848 --> 24:03.510
it on the beach. You don't bury it on the beach. You 
just keep bringing it back to you. And

24:06.373 --> 24:13.300
the salt water doesn't do a darn thing.

24:17.003 --> 24:19.986
Well, I think that's about all my notes that I've 
put down. If there's notes that are available,

24:20.087 --> 24:22.589
I'll take the notes, too. You want these? Yeah. Can 
I have them? Yeah. Oh, I had a poem. Do you remember

24:28.435 --> 24:30.437
that poem, The Piddling Pup? that Dr. Morney had on 
his stationery. Well, I like the title. Well, it

24:35.392 --> 24:40.579
goes on about 10, 12 verses and ends up with Rump had 
diabetes. Let me have your address. Do you have a

24:42.822 --> 24:43.563
card? No, I don't have a card. Let me just... I'll 
tell you, Dr. McCammish had a little thing. I think

24:50.593 --> 24:56.320
it was the creed of the doctor. And John's daddy was 
a physician. Mm-hmm. And... I wish every

25:00.252 --> 25:04.359
veterinarian had that where he'd see it once in a 
while. You know, it states that, you know, your

25:04.379 --> 25:13.033
clients are your livelihood, and if they weren't 
for them, you wouldn't have any income or this and

25:04.379 --> 25:13.033
that. And it makes a lot of people stop and think 
that they're all going too fast, you know. I used to

25:16.899 --> 25:19.723
go in Johnny's place once in a while and always read 
that, you know. Everybody ought to read that.
