00:09.737 --> 00:11.880
This is November 22nd. My calendar's around every 
reason I'm glancing at it. 37 years ago at this

00:15.704 --> 00:23.033
moment, we were hearing the news of the 
assassination of President Kennedy. I have the

00:24.135 --> 00:30.122
honor and joy of chatting with former Dean of 
Medicine Robert Stone, Bob, to begin with, would

00:30.878 --> 00:47.254
you introduce yourself to anyone who might listen 
or read the transcript of this, describe where you

00:30.878 --> 00:47.254
grew up, what mom and dad did, where did you go to 
high school and college, experience before

00:30.878 --> 00:47.254
coming to A&M?

00:54.562 --> 00:55.823
I was born in Manhattan. on what had been the site of 
Peter Stuyvesant's farm

00:57.997 --> 01:07.246
but was no longer Peter Stuyvesant's farm. Early 
on we moved to Winston-Salem and then

01:08.487 --> 01:25.303
subsequently returned during the Depression to 
Brooklyn and I went to grade school, finished

01:08.487 --> 01:25.303
grade school in Brooklyn went to a boys high school 
in Brooklyn. It was called Boys High School, had

01:28.558 --> 01:39.533
been and was still, I think, a distinguished 
institution that taught Latin and Greek. It was an

01:39.893 --> 01:46.482
ethnically very mixed neighborhood, but also in 
transition. It's now part of

01:46.562 --> 01:53.672
Bedford-Stuyvesant, which is the Brooklyn 
equivalent of Harlem. There's a difference. I

01:56.148 --> 02:25.007
went from there to Brooklyn College

01:56.148 --> 02:25.007
and I think Brooklyn College was a distinguished 
school at that time too I was an extremely poor

01:56.148 --> 02:25.007
student on probation alternate years academic 
probation

01:56.148 --> 02:25.007
and in 1942 I joined the United States Navy was in 
the Navy for four years and then

02:25.561 --> 02:51.670
and knew for some years that I wanted to go to 
medical school I was accepted at the what was then

02:25.561 --> 02:51.670
called Long Island College of Medicine during the 
time that I was there it was absorbed by the State

02:52.257 --> 02:55.722
University of New York and became SUNY downstate. 
Received my degree there and

02:56.743 --> 03:16.611
went up to Columbia Presbyterian for two years of 
pathology and then as part of the original faculty

02:56.743 --> 03:16.611
at UCLA in medicine as that school was being 
developed. What year was that? 1952.

03:24.877 --> 03:31.323
I finished my formal pathology training at UCLA. 
UCLA had, oh, I was due for a sabbatical and

03:31.383 --> 03:51.762
proposed to go to Rockefeller Foundation, which I 
did, and then to go on from there for the second six

03:31.383 --> 03:51.762
months to the Netherlands. electron microscopy 
of viruses. But UCLA had developed a bilateral

03:56.618 --> 04:10.737
arrangement with Yale University to staff the 
Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission office in

03:56.618 --> 04:10.737
Hiroshima and Nagasaki. And I was given the 
opportunity then to extend my sabbatical for

04:12.740 --> 04:21.512
another six months to make it one year. So, with a 
baby that had just been born, was a week old, my

04:21.728 --> 04:45.762
spouse and I went to Hiroshima and I worked there 
for a year on the late effects of atomic radiation

04:21.728 --> 04:45.762
and then returned to UCLA in 1963.

04:46.737 --> 04:53.725
I was invited to become a member of the founding 
faculty at the University of New Mexico Medical

04:46.737 --> 04:53.725
School in Albuquerque.

04:58.430 --> 05:11.204
I was chairman of the department, subsequently 
became dean and vice president, and then took

04:58.430 --> 05:11.204
another sabbatical, this time as a visiting 
professor of management at the Sloan School, MIT.

05:14.428 --> 05:16.390
While I was there, I was, as far as I was concerned, 
unexpectedly invited to go and head the NIH, which

05:17.534 --> 05:26.642
I did for two years.

05:29.785 --> 05:46.039
I had

05:29.785 --> 05:46.039
substantial, what shall I say, personality 
differences with the hierarchy and HEW, HEW it was

05:29.785 --> 05:46.039
at that time, and was invited to leave. So I left 
there and went to the University of Oregon Health

05:48.415 --> 06:06.416
Sciences Center in Portland as dean and vice 
president, stayed for about two and a half, maybe

05:48.415 --> 06:06.416
three years, and then had an opportunity to come to 
Texas A&M. How did A&M and you first communicate?

06:10.080 --> 06:12.583
Who spotted you? I think Dr. Prescott telephoned 
me. I don't know where he got my name, I was

06:19.533 --> 06:36.771
interested, we had a little dinner about two 
months ago honoring

06:19.533 --> 06:36.771
Sam Black and Jeanette Farris was there. We got 
into a lot of reminiscing about the initiation of

06:37.652 --> 06:46.401
the medical program because our guest speaker was 
Jim Schofield. Jim had been the secretary for the

06:47.512 --> 07:01.370
liaison committee on medical education at the 
time that it was proposed to start the medical

06:47.512 --> 07:01.370
school here in conjunction with Baylor College of 
Medicine. And so we prodded Jim to reminisce.

07:07.798 --> 07:11.983
There was a dean, I don't know his name, who was at 
Baylor, who was sort of designated as the A&MD, and

07:12.773 --> 07:18.299
you perhaps remember him. And then

07:19.861 --> 07:24.446
Knight was appointed. In the course of the 
conversation, Jeanette told me that my name had

07:26.709 --> 07:42.527
been proposed prior to Dr. Knight's, but the 
conclusion here, and maybe you were a part of it, I

07:26.709 --> 07:42.527
don't know. was that I could not be moved from 
Oregon. So they had invited Knight to come. I never

07:50.272 --> 08:01.693
inquired into the circumstances that led to Dr. 
Knight's retirement or whatever. But in any case,

08:02.334 --> 08:05.460
at that time, there was a real question in the minds 
of the regents, Joe Reynolds and others, as to

08:06.183 --> 08:13.131
whether the medical school should continue at 
all. And

08:14.632 --> 08:27.186
Reynolds and Mac Prescott, I guess, went up to see 
Jim Schofield and discussed how and should they

08:14.632 --> 08:27.186
close the school. And it was apparently in that 
conversation that my name was proposed,

08:28.087 --> 08:36.156
seemingly already somewhat familiar to them. And 
so Mac called me. Do you remember your reaction to

08:38.716 --> 08:40.518
the call? Was it positive, negative? Well, I had 
been on the liaison, a member of the liaison

08:42.782 --> 08:48.009
committee on medical education. At the time, the 
proposal came before that body or the

08:48.470 --> 08:54.638
establishment of the medical school at Texas A&M. 
I think it's fair to say that all of us were very

08:56.381 --> 08:59.165
skeptical. It sounded like a rather bizarre 
undertaking as it was proposed. And so I would say

09:06.528 --> 09:29.076
this, to circle back slightly, that from the 
perspective of Albuquerque, I had long looked at

09:06.528 --> 09:29.076
Texas as an extremely wealthy state, one which 
supported medical education enthusiastically

09:06.528 --> 09:29.076
and handsomely. And so I was tantalized by the 
possibility that the state would do equally well

09:29.647 --> 09:39.637
at Texas A&M as it had done at the University of 
Texas. All right, while we're at this point

09:40.498 --> 09:59.417
chronologically, before we could get any kind of 
preliminary certification approval, back when

09:40.498 --> 09:59.417
the plan with Calhoun and Williams was a three-way 
working relationship including Baylor. Yes. We

10:01.539 --> 10:04.581
never could get any tentative approval of that. 
You bet. Then I one day found some reference that

10:07.804 --> 10:19.494
one of the key people at the national level had 
worked at Baylor and he and Dr. DeBakey had not

10:07.804 --> 10:19.494
gotten along. Who was that? That was Jim 
Schofield. All right. And so I called that to

10:22.777 --> 10:26.481
Calhoun's attention and he said, okay, we'll try. 
And so the Baylor official link was eliminated and

10:29.823 --> 10:59.745
very quickly our yes yes yes it was not as far as I can 
tell and as I say I did have I do have some insight

10:29.823 --> 10:59.745
into this from a different perspective 180 
degrees different that Schofield was not being

10:29.823 --> 10:59.745
vindictive vis-a-vis Baylor that it was far more 
complicated academically complicated in the

10:29.823 --> 10:59.745
eyes of the review committee yes Yes, indeed. When 
Prescott called you, how soon before y'all

11:02.445 --> 11:10.574
followed up after his first call? I don't remember 
precisely, but it might have been as much as a week.

11:15.900 --> 11:17.342
Did somebody visit? Did you come down here? Oh, I 
came down, yes. Yes, I came down.

11:26.641 --> 11:31.489
felt, and I guess that was true, proven to be true, 
that we hit it off very well, very quickly. We went

11:32.310 --> 11:35.976
to the Texan for supper. That was the elite, I 
guess, the most distinguished place in town to go

11:37.879 --> 11:44.470
and eat, and so we went there. And who was your host 
during most of the visit, Prescott? I think so. I

11:51.702 --> 11:53.104
don't remember clearly. And what was your 
impression of what was here? Well, I had been on the

11:58.748 --> 12:10.029
ground floor in the establishment of UCLA and of 
the University of New Mexico. I had become part of a

12:11.030 --> 12:17.522
loosely constituted group which were of 
individuals, administrative individuals,

12:18.515 --> 12:25.785
involved with the establishment of new medical 
schools. It was rather a closed group. And I had a

12:30.592 --> 12:43.269
lot of enjoyment about that was a time when, I'm 
going back a little bit, a time when there was a

12:30.592 --> 12:43.269
whole surge of new medical schools being 
established. In fact, Texas A&M was at the tail end

12:43.289 --> 12:47.695
of that rather than the height of that. But the 
notion of establishing a new medical school and

12:48.350 --> 13:01.711
having, I took it that it was establishing a new 
medical school to come here, although some being

12:48.350 --> 13:01.711
on hand already would not have viewed it that way 
and did not. But I saw it as an opportunity to,

13:02.512 --> 13:14.391
without being, I guess, pretentious or 
overbearing, of shaping what a medical school

13:02.512 --> 13:14.391
might be. and I knew something of the clinical 
arrangements that could be established. I had

13:21.346 --> 13:43.129
been through

13:21.346 --> 13:43.129
some severe internecine battles both at UCLA and 
at New Mexico and knew what the impact was of coming

13:21.346 --> 13:43.129
in and establishing a new medical school in the 
face of a practicing profession no matter how much

13:43.615 --> 14:12.863
at the opening they said they were interested they 
invited the medical school enthusiastic uh... in

13:43.615 --> 14:12.863
those two instances and elsewhere around the 
country there invariably was bloodshed and so i

13:43.615 --> 14:12.863
saw an opportunity to develop the affiliation 
with scott and white along a totally new direction

13:43.615 --> 14:12.863
the only thing at least is somewhat comparable to 
it was mayo which was different because mayo

13:43.615 --> 14:12.863
medical school is a wholly owned subsidiary And I 
might say parenthetically that the expectation

14:13.467 --> 14:32.533
of a few of the physicians already on hand here was 
not at all that we'd have that arrangement, but

14:13.467 --> 14:32.533
rather that they would establish themselves as 
professors in the new medical school, be

14:13.467 --> 14:32.533
distinguished, and benefit financially from it. 
And so they didn't view with enthusiasm the notion

14:33.113 --> 14:37.419
of this new arrangement either. But I was 
intrigued at the idea of, of a new medical school

14:43.522 --> 14:54.719
being able to do something different and becoming 
the dean of three medical schools. Did you have any

14:54.739 --> 15:00.948
key discussions with anyone other than Vice 
President Prescott? Oh I did of course. I knew the

15:02.911 --> 15:07.938
medical education establishment very well. I 
guess it's not unfair to say I was part of it. So yes,

15:12.277 --> 15:30.778
I did consult with some people and get their 
notions about what the prospects were here and how

15:12.277 --> 15:30.778
colleagues on the LCME would react to some 
proposals which were rather different from

15:12.277 --> 15:30.778
usual. What advice did they give you? Just stay in 
Oregon.

15:39.387 --> 15:40.208
Stay in Oregon? go so far as to indicate they didn't 
think this program would ever survive yes oh they

15:40.795 --> 16:08.018
did yes yes and there are some who still believe 
that um all right then here on the campus with whom

15:40.795 --> 16:08.018
did you have serious discussions other than dr 
prescott jarvis miller and uh williams and those

15:40.795 --> 16:08.018
were the only people in general what what did they 
oh they were 100 supportive 100% enthusiastic. I

16:11.047 --> 16:19.538
would say that those three individuals, I can't 
imagine three individuals who would have been

16:11.047 --> 16:19.538
more supportive. Oh, and there's another one that 
should be mentioned, and that is Walter Brindley.

16:25.967 --> 16:35.980
I did have a couple of good sessions at Scott and 
White and discussed with them what would happen if

16:36.297 --> 16:39.842
if they became part of a medical school, 
particularly a state medical school. And with

16:41.265 --> 16:54.845
some trepidation, I can recall asking them, a 
group around the table, the board, the Scott and

16:41.265 --> 16:54.845
White board, I said, I'm not interested in being 
provocative. But as a state medical school, we

16:56.788 --> 17:03.158
will have to take students of all ethnic 
backgrounds. We have got to do it. there were all

17:05.980 --> 17:25.677
white faces around the table and all males as you 
can imagine and I said what happens when we have

17:05.980 --> 17:25.677
black medical students or I really wasn't 
conscious of the Hispanic issue at that time but I

17:05.980 --> 17:25.677
said black and I was reassured by those southern 
gentlemen that they would accept them that they

17:26.095 --> 17:32.244
would fit in, they would be treated as members of 
the student body, and there would be no problem.

17:32.605 --> 17:34.067
There never was, to my knowledge. At least none 
ever came to my attention. Not a bit. It was some

17:39.875 --> 17:46.505
years, I think, before we had our first black 
student, but there was no problem. But I was afraid

17:47.086 --> 17:51.472
that I would get read out. Now, this conversation, 
what year was this? Oh, that must have been 1977.

17:57.699 --> 17:59.602
I'm not certain, but I think so. When did you 
arrive? I think 77. Might have been the tail end of

18:05.152 --> 18:06.534
76. Did we yet have medical, were we already, did we 
already have medical students? 24 first-year

18:12.685 --> 18:14.769
students. They were already enrolled. They had 
they had by then I guess really finished the first

18:18.205 --> 18:40.062
year and that's what the problem was in the minds of 
Reynolds the other regents and Prescott as to what

18:18.205 --> 18:40.062
to do with those students if they closed the school 
would there be a place for them elsewhere in the

18:18.205 --> 18:40.062
country now was there as far as you were aware when 
you arrived was there any question about funding

18:18.205 --> 18:40.062
no And that probably was, to some extent, my fault. 
That is, I didn't pursue that. I didn't hammer on

18:47.530 --> 18:49.593
it. I was simply told that there would be resources 
available to develop a medical school. And I took

18:54.419 --> 18:56.021
that at face value. Did Williams, Miller, 
Prescott, and others make any commitments about

18:56.822 --> 19:04.092
facilities funding and staffing? No, no. And you 
didn't lay down any conditions? No, no. There was

19:09.809 --> 19:24.103
already a notion and maybe a commitment on the part 
of the regents, I'm not certain about this, to

19:09.809 --> 19:24.103
build a basic science building and that there 
would be plenty of land available.

19:27.226 --> 19:39.377
I did not believe and still do not believe that we 
needed or wanted a university hospital and that,

19:27.226 --> 19:39.377
although I must say that the men that I dealt with 
were men of enormous goodwill. I don't think they

19:41.760 --> 19:47.247
understood what it would mean to have a university 
hospital. I've been there in Missouri. I know what

19:49.369 --> 19:55.497
that means, or some of what that means, and I know 
how many headaches they have missed as a result of

19:49.369 --> 19:55.497
it. Yes. Let's see, and the only money question I'm 
going to ask, what was your beginning salary? Do

20:02.906 --> 20:03.366
you remember? I don't remember. It was, in my mind 
at that time, generous. But it was not sufficient

20:09.462 --> 20:15.890
to attract me here. Did it compare with what you 
were making in Oregon?

20:23.781 --> 20:30.490
I know it did because I know that the folks here made 
inquiry at Oregon as to what my salary was. But I

20:31.151 --> 20:33.173
simply do not remember. I'm not dissembling. I 
simply don't remember what it was. Describe the

20:36.518 --> 20:39.081
move of you and your wife and any family you had with 
you at that time describe your move here how did

20:39.550 --> 21:07.752
that go physical relocation

20:39.550 --> 21:07.752
well there's

20:39.550 --> 21:07.752
no problem about Mary and me Lael would have been 
Lael is my daughter would have been at that time if

20:39.550 --> 21:07.752
we're talking about 1977 she would have been 17 
years old And there was a question of where she

21:09.436 --> 21:13.861
would or should go to school. So she had been at the

21:15.683 --> 21:28.198
National Cathedral School when we were in 
Washington. She then, I guess, went to Concord

21:29.560 --> 21:35.887
Academy, and she was applying to medical school. 
Oh, I will tell you a little story about that. And

21:39.119 --> 21:41.061
she was applying to college. And partly because we 
were already on the West Coast, she had applied to

21:43.004 --> 21:54.578
Stanford and been admitted to several schools, 
but admitted to Stanford. And so I guess there was

21:55.839 --> 22:00.946
no big problem about her moving. It was just about 
the time that she started. I'd need to check the

22:03.108 --> 22:07.033
dates, but I think she was just about to enter 
Stanford. Shortly after we got here and got

22:08.903 --> 22:22.941
settled and were so pleased with our only child 
matriculating at Stanford, we were invited to

22:08.903 --> 22:22.941
some sort of reception where people ask, you know, 
your family. We had one daughter. Where is she?

22:26.205 --> 22:27.207
She's at Stanford. Oh, she'll be transferring 
here, won't she?

22:33.760 --> 22:36.043
Maybe you better not put that in the record. No, no, 
I think that's a good one. There must have been some

22:40.829 --> 22:48.138
other experiences you had about comparing life on 
the West Coast and D.C. with here. How easy was it to

22:50.621 --> 22:53.284
become a Texan? Well, you see, it wasn't all that 
different. I had been a Southerner. I had a good

22:58.611 --> 23:03.717
part of my life grown up, or a good part of an 
impressionable I'd grown up in Winston-Salem. I

23:07.972 --> 23:11.037
even went occasionally to Baptist Sunday School. 
And then I had lived in New Mexico. And I wasn't the

23:15.705 --> 23:28.607
stereotypical Easterner, New Yorker, maybe even 
worse, a Brooklynite, to put it right at the

23:15.705 --> 23:28.607
bottom. So I didn't feel that there was much that I 
needed to adapt very much. Jim Schofield reminded

23:36.236 --> 23:43.905
me when we had this little dinner the other time 
that I had asked him for advice before coming out

23:36.236 --> 23:43.905
here. Jim boasts about being a fourth or fifth 
generation Texan and coming. You use the term hard

23:50.172 --> 23:52.234
shell Baptist. That's where he comes from. He 
talks about it as his background, but he said,

23:58.118 --> 24:05.308
Well, what I told you was don't talk so fast.

24:05.489 --> 24:09.254
That was my total sociological adjustment. When 
you arrived, describe where the students and the

24:09.274 --> 24:16.325
faculty and the medical school facilities were 
located. Well, sure.

24:25.658 --> 24:55.058
they were in several buildings the students were 
in several buildings and most notably in Teague

24:25.658 --> 24:55.058
I need to go back a little bit again historically 
when I went to UCLA our first offices were in

24:25.658 --> 24:55.058
Quonset huts literally Quonset huts and in the 
religious conferences building which was taken

24:25.658 --> 24:55.058
out in order to give us some room to start the 
medical school We grew into a rather massive

24:57.265 --> 24:59.829
structure. But in 1963, when I went to 
Albuquerque, we started out in a converted,

25:00.951 --> 25:19.341
literally, seven-up bottling plant with a broken 
pane of windows in the front and a mortuary, which

25:00.951 --> 25:19.341
they bought for us. Fortunately, they were 
adjacent to the campus. It became part of the

25:21.485 --> 25:23.408
campus. So it wasn't a shock to me to move into those 
kind of quarters. Additionally, because I had

25:28.397 --> 25:46.899
been doing so much visiting as part of 
accreditation of medical schools around the

25:28.397 --> 25:46.899
country, I was very familiar with what were called 
surge facilities, where the program at Davis was

25:28.397 --> 25:46.899
one of the most beautiful I've ever seen. Davis, of 
course, an agricultural school by heritage, they

25:52.953 --> 26:21.643
started in the university stable and they had 
taken the stables which were made of fine old

25:52.953 --> 26:21.643
redwood and made the most beautiful quarters you 
can imagine well that was that was the ultimate way

25:52.953 --> 26:21.643
to go with the surge facilities so it didn't bother 
me a bit that we were in temporary facilities here I

25:52.953 --> 26:21.643
knew that we would be getting something in 
addition and who were the key faculty members that

25:52.953 --> 26:21.643
were here yeah

26:22.737 --> 26:49.386
virtually all of the well all of the what's 
so-called preclinical department heads had been

26:22.737 --> 26:49.386
appointed the only one who was new coming just 
before I came but whom I had an opportunity to sign

26:22.737 --> 26:49.386
off on was George Cho but Garrett Iler was here 
Wagner was here on anatomy Sam Black I hope you'll

26:49.703 --> 27:18.833
talk with Sam if you haven't done so already all 
right and let's see oh Joyce Davis with whom you

26:49.703 --> 27:18.833
ought to talk to Phil was on the faculty an 
internist and Phil was one of those doctors this I

26:49.703 --> 27:18.833
think needs to be filtered filter Phil was one of 
those people who anticipated being professor of

27:19.252 --> 27:45.850
medicine and having a practice in the medical 
school and when he saw the way things were going he

27:19.252 --> 27:45.850
went into town and set up his practice didn't 
bother Joyce a bit yes and that's

27:19.252 --> 27:45.850
one place that I feel very strongly negative and 
that was Elvin Smith I have subsequently come to

27:46.555 --> 27:53.442
believe that this, I guess you better turn off, 
really. To go to this issue of joining up with Scott

27:55.044 --> 28:02.572
and White, it wasn't clear what we would do in the 
way of clinical facilities. There was the

28:03.353 --> 28:07.477
possibility that somehow we would work at the St. 
Joseph Hospital. I went to Austin and had some

28:09.399 --> 28:14.284
interviews there at Breckenridge. talked with 
the faculty with the physicians on the staff there

28:15.074 --> 28:44.642
to look at the possibility that the last two years 
of the medical school would be in Austin rather

28:15.074 --> 28:44.642
than in Scott and White and subsequently it was I 
think I don't think it's overstating it to say it

28:15.074 --> 28:44.642
was my decision that we would go with Scott and 
White and we'd establish the relationship there

28:15.074 --> 28:44.642
and it would bring along the VA hospital for 
somewhat political reasons, but also

28:45.213 --> 28:50.577
substantive reasons. And there was, Alvin

28:51.899 --> 29:01.707
did not support that. And it has been, it has seemed 
to be on his agenda from that time on to separate the

29:03.769 --> 29:15.118
college from Scott and White. When did you first 
begin to interact with Dr. Brindley? Oh, within

29:21.165 --> 29:25.110
the first week or month or something like that. I 
mean, I probably met them when I first came here

29:25.150 --> 29:29.175
before I had taken the job. Describe Dr. Brindley, 
first of all, by personality. Well, he was a

29:33.040 --> 29:41.190
courtly southern gentleman.

29:41.660 --> 29:45.724
He didn't have a white beard, but he could have been 
Colonel Saunders or something. There was no

29:45.744 --> 29:47.246
question about that. And his official, he was 
president of? He was president of the Scott and

29:50.749 --> 29:54.973
White Clinic Board. I think they called, yes, 
president. And so he was, in fact, the CEO. Oh, yes,

30:02.421 --> 30:05.083
indeed, indeed, indeed. And what was his basic 
attitude about the A&M relationship? Oh, he was

30:10.634 --> 30:11.937
enthusiastic. I don't think there's any 
question. I think he

30:14.043 --> 30:25.453
did not know how to mentally compute The, I'm going 
to call them power relationships, just to be

30:26.041 --> 30:32.687
simple and fast. But the authority 
relationships, the responsibility

30:33.388 --> 30:41.176
relationships as between the university and 
Scott and White. And that was a major problem for

30:41.196 --> 30:53.888
both the faculty here and the faculty in Temple, to 
understand how they could work together. and how

30:55.893 --> 31:21.833
they would be how they might be taking orders from 
somebody else that is still I think it's greatly

30:55.893 --> 31:21.833
diminished but that also always was an underlying 
question of well what would be the dean's

30:55.893 --> 31:21.833
authority would the dean decide whether or not 
Scott and White could hire such and such a

30:55.893 --> 31:21.833
physician And I think that that was the best part of 
the relationship that I had with Scott and White.
