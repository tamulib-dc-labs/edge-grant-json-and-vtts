WEBVTT

00:03.187 --> 00:05.869
for any reason, that's easy to do. All right. Let's 
start. Go ahead. I can see that it's working. One,

00:12.976 --> 00:14.698
two, three, say a sentence. You think it's 
working? Okay. This is May 9, sitting on the 10th

00:19.062 --> 00:28.690
floor of the Rudder Tower, getting ready to 
interview Dr. Malin Sutherland, the Vice

00:19.062 --> 00:28.690
President for Student Affairs. Malin, as we 
begin, for someone who might listen to this tape or

00:32.009 --> 00:45.031
read the transcribed version in coming years who 
might not know you, would you begin by summarizing

00:32.009 --> 00:45.031
your background before A&M? Where did you grow up? 
What did parents do for a living? Where did you go to

00:47.536 --> 00:48.978
high school and so forth? All right, thank you, 
Haskell. I basically grew up in Houston. My

00:55.682 --> 00:57.565
parents divorced when I was three. The 
Sutherlands are from East Texas, all small towns.

01:01.992 --> 01:08.622
Dad was one of nine children, and so I still have a 
herd of aunts and uncles and cousins. My mother's

01:09.623 --> 01:11.286
side was much smaller. Mother was a nurse, so she 
went to Houston, and I grew up, by today's

01:12.007 --> 01:17.475
standards, downtown. I went to Roberts 
Elementary and Wharton Elementary and Lanier

01:19.934 --> 01:25.579
Junior High and San Jacinto High School. Came here 
in the fall of 60 as a freshman. I already had been in

01:31.184 --> 01:37.129
ROTC so I had a strong interest in being 
commissioned. I tell students today that to be

01:38.671 --> 01:47.899
admitted to the A&M College of Texas you had to have 
a high school You had to have graduated from high

01:48.200 --> 01:50.344
school. And it's always good for a good laugh, and 
they're not sure they believe you. But it's very

01:55.535 --> 01:56.998
true. As far as you can recall, where did you first 
begin to have an interest in coming to A&M? Where

02:03.631 --> 02:04.453
did that get? It was because of ROTC. I actually had 
a family friend that worked for Congressman

02:07.163 --> 02:14.173
Thomas in Houston. And so there was a very meager 
attempt at getting a commission to West Point,

02:14.714 --> 02:22.065
appointment to West Point. But I didn't have the 
academic background or the strength to do that. So

02:27.593 --> 02:32.039
the sort of obvious next choice in Texas was A&M. Do 
you remember when you first visited here? I would

02:37.070 --> 02:43.778
assume the first time I came was when I came in the 
summer to take some testing after I'd already been

02:37.070 --> 02:43.778
admitted. I do not know that I'd ever been here for 
any reason prior to that. Took the bus from

02:49.024 --> 02:53.049
Houston, walked up the main gate. I remember it was 
in the chemistry building. I remember the test was

02:55.432 --> 03:00.018
given and did something the next morning and went 
home. Did it make any impression? Did you run into

03:02.621 --> 03:04.343
Aggies or? Any distinctive greeting or anything 
like that? This was summer and, you know, early

03:08.834 --> 03:14.679
evening, and I don't have any distinctive 
memories. Had you seen a Rice A&M football game

03:15.220 --> 03:17.862
possible? I had seen football games every year 
because I did go to all the Rice games, you know, as a

03:17.882 --> 03:25.990
high school student in Houston. And we lived in 
West University Place with a second marriage for

03:26.511 --> 03:32.997
about three years of my mother. And so we went to all 
of those games. Dickie Magel was the superstar

03:36.171 --> 03:39.736
with Rice. And I saw the A&M game where Rice had them 
down by 12 points, I think. And A&M scored three

03:48.509 --> 03:53.055
touchdowns in less than four minutes. So that was 
pretty easy to remember. There was a guy named Dick

03:55.799 --> 04:00.385
Gottlieb who was a very active Aggie in Houston. 
and had one of the first television shows that were

04:00.618 --> 04:05.784
local. And it was, I remember it was sponsored by 
Hickey P-Lot Grocery and some kind of a silly game.

04:15.314 --> 04:21.541
And he often spoke of A&M, talked of core trips when 
they came and football and stuff. And I remember

04:22.162 --> 04:23.784
that. And fortunately, I got to know him. You know, 
as time went along, he ended up being a city

04:26.470 --> 04:34.501
councilman, very, very active in Houston. And one 
of my stories ended up relating to him, too. Now,

04:42.812 --> 04:46.978
when you came to enroll, how did you get here and how 
did that visit? Came by bus. That night, my mother

04:49.001 --> 04:52.225
did drove me up here. the sort of typical story of 
pulling up to Moore Hall and get out of the car with

04:52.711 --> 05:03.631
your footlocker and you know good luck and 
goodbye. What'd you have in the footlocker do you

05:04.813 --> 05:06.236
remember? I don't know, just normal things. So you 
don't recall bringing anything that turned out to

05:09.321 --> 05:14.230
be truly superfluous and unmeaning? No, we didn't 
have the money to have any superfluous stuff. It

05:19.033 --> 05:22.136
was just whatever they had said bring is what I 
would have brought. Describe getting into that

05:22.617 --> 05:26.541
room and becoming a part of an outfit. I remember it 
as fairly routine. It was all new, completely new

05:31.746 --> 05:35.390
to me. You start meeting people and moving in. I had 
a roommate. The fish old lady was from New Iberia,

05:42.307 --> 05:48.893
Louisiana, and he was just kind of a good old boy. He 
was a little shorter in stature, but he had a car, a

05:48.913 --> 05:58.242
brand new car, a Studebaker Lark, I think it was. 
And so we were together all in the fall and caused

05:59.363 --> 06:05.169
two or three interesting things to happen. And I 
had a different roommate in the spring, and At the

06:08.885 --> 06:15.478
end of my freshman year, I both flunked out and 
needed to go to work. The money was thin, so I went

06:15.498 --> 06:19.707
back to Houston. I worked at Foley's, actually for 
a leasee of Foley's, but it was in their department

06:19.807 --> 06:27.282
store. called the Coin and Currency Institute of 
New York. They operated an independent coin shop

06:30.104 --> 06:34.231
in Foley's. And so I was the number two person of 
three for a year and a half. I did go to U of H part of

06:41.304 --> 06:46.553
that time.

06:47.326 --> 06:51.349
It was clear that I wanted to be commissioned and 
that I wanted to graduate. I scratched and clawed

06:52.370 --> 06:56.394
every single semester that I was here. In those 
days, even with somebody with my stature, they

06:57.334 --> 07:05.702
would let take 20 hours a semester so you could 
graduate in four years. And that, you know, that

07:06.522 --> 07:08.724
was stupidity for me. I mean, there was no chance of 
having, if I had a C, it was going to be really good.

07:14.509 --> 07:16.911
So I graduated with two grade points too many. in 
the May of 1965, was a little off on my ROTC, so I did

07:17.262 --> 07:26.812
summer camp at Fort Selle, Oklahoma after I 
graduated. So I was commissioned up there. And

07:29.534 --> 07:38.844
like I say, I had full blinders on, had absolutely 
no career direction other than military service.

07:40.005 --> 07:44.890
The purpose of graduating was that you had to in 
order to be commissioned. All right, now today we

07:45.933 --> 07:48.896
want to concentrate on those student years. 
Describe how you became a part of the routine at

07:50.238 --> 07:55.163
A&M. How did you get introduced to the lingo, to 
the... Well, the short answer is just as a freshman

07:55.183 --> 08:03.091
in the Corps. You just have to automatically know 
what it was because it was still mandatory. You had

08:08.577 --> 08:11.620
tremendous turnover. You know, if people, 
retention was awful. You know, it was usually 50%

08:16.708 --> 08:19.491
was considered good. I was on, because of my ROTC 
experience in high school, I was on something

08:21.713 --> 08:27.799
called the fish drill team. And that was kind of my, 
you know, my haven to where good things happened. I

08:34.106 --> 08:36.088
knew exactly what was going on there. We ate late 
tables in Duncan Dining Hall, which meant that we

08:36.558 --> 08:53.503
got to eat all we could hold, and the meals were 
still, there were no classes at noon, so all three

08:36.558 --> 08:53.503
formations still happened all the time, and there 
wasn't any place to eat. other than on campus,

08:54.192 --> 08:56.777
including the weekends. You might have gone to one 
of the boarding houses for 75 cents if people had a

08:57.458 --> 09:07.375
car and could go, but most of the time you just 
stayed on campus. Describe a typical weekday,

09:07.696 --> 09:11.543
class day. When did it begin and what happened 
when? from the time you got up till you went to bed

09:15.353 --> 09:17.736
that night? My memory is that you really didn't get 
up until about 6.30. You know, the kids get up kind

09:21.501 --> 09:24.565
of at first call. You know, maybe five or ten 
minutes earlier at some stage, but pretty much at

09:25.306 --> 09:30.633
first call. And you didn't fall out until the third 
call. Freshmen and sophomores fell out at third

09:33.977 --> 09:41.166
call, which was four or five minutes away from, you 
know, the formation happening. And... My memory

09:45.020 --> 09:53.749
is that you were inside a little bit on the wall and 
people asked questions and things, but it seems to

09:45.020 --> 09:53.749
me that that happened outside. We fell outside and 
were in formation and there were still questions

09:54.891 --> 10:00.216
and things going on. And then you would have 
morning formation and you'd march off to chow. I

10:06.223 --> 10:08.405
don't have distinctive memories. Most of my 
memory relates to when I was a senior because when I

10:08.846 --> 10:14.892
came back, As a sophomore, I changed to company G3. 
I'd been in company F2 as a fish, but my buddies were

10:19.647 --> 10:25.235
now juniors, and I was going to be a sophomore. And I 
changed from 64 to class 65 because I knew I was

10:25.716 --> 10:34.448
going to be with them the next three years, and it 
was the right thing to do. So I was in G3 in the Sevesa

10:35.410 --> 10:38.093
area. I lived in the Sevesa area every semester 
except one. Only one semester did I live in the

10:42.239 --> 10:44.743
Duncan area. We were a little more autonomous over 
there. Pretty much did our own thing. Rarely saw

10:50.491 --> 10:53.295
anybody from core staff. I never recall seeing the 
commandant or anybody. You did see whoever the

10:58.061 --> 11:07.372
commandant's duty officer was, usually at lunch, 
because they had lunch over there with you. But you

11:07.413 --> 11:09.415
didn't see those people much. So y'all didn't 
march to Chow then? We marched to Sebesa every

11:13.199 --> 11:15.461
single formation. Oh, you did, okay. Yes, all 
three. But about what percentage of the Corps was

11:17.404 --> 11:22.871
in the Sebesa area at that time? I would guess a 
third, a quarter to a third. All four of the

11:29.239 --> 11:38.490
corridor-style halls were Corps, and the When I 
was a senior, the balcony style, some of those were

11:39.078 --> 11:43.303
core. When they were first, the fall of 64 is when 
those opened. Was there any difference in the

11:49.169 --> 12:00.542
dormitory routine of what actually happened in 
the core units in the core area and in the Northgate

11:49.169 --> 12:00.542
area? As far as I know, there wasn't. It was 
essentially the same. Sabisa was, you know, it was

12:05.875 --> 12:08.518
fine. We marched right up the main steps there. But 
my freshman year, you know, fish didn't eat a lot.

12:17.710 --> 12:21.654
And there was always questions and things going 
on. But I started to say, well, I go, my memory is of

12:22.255 --> 12:29.604
breakfast formation is when I was a senior, is that 
I would arrive. There were only, I think, four or

12:30.385 --> 12:33.469
five of us that were seniors. because I was moved to 
company G3. I'm sorry, from G3 to company A3. And

12:41.099 --> 12:42.941
they had two seniors. My old unit, G3, it had 18. And 
so they moved about three of us over there. Of

12:48.568 --> 12:53.174
course, I thought it was a communist plot that this 
was terrible and the commandant couldn't do this.

12:53.314 --> 13:00.182
And since I was then a sophomore, junior, and I was 
then senior advisor to the fish drill team, I knew

12:53.314 --> 13:00.182
the commandant. So I went and saw Colonel Baker, 
and he listened and smiled and said, you're going

13:00.685 --> 13:06.012
to A3. And I said, thank you very much. And away I 
went. And he was exactly right. I had a lot more fun

13:12.060 --> 13:13.422
there. And I was the only senior that liked to go to 
breakfast. So you only had to have one go. So I was

13:22.775 --> 13:24.257
just about it. And I had my routine. I would arrive 
at formation at the precise moment to salute. I

13:30.993 --> 13:39.363
would hand off my Houston Post newspaper to a fish 
in ranks, and we would head to Sabisa, and I would

13:30.993 --> 13:39.363
drink coffee and read the paper. And if anybody 
said anything at my table, I was not happy. I wanted

13:43.909 --> 13:44.810
silence. And so they would kill to be on my table. So 
they knew they had nothing to do or nobody was going

13:49.276 --> 13:52.700
to bother them. It was a small, good time. Let's go 
back to the fish drill team. You're the first

13:58.247 --> 14:00.510
person that I have encountered who has mentioned 
being on that drill team, tell this machine all

14:01.351 --> 14:14.771
that you can remember about

14:01.351 --> 14:14.771
the drill team and getting on it and what it 
involved and what y'all did and everything. Well,

14:16.214 --> 14:20.440
I had three sophomores in F2 that had been drill 
team, and they were three very good people. You

14:27.165 --> 14:32.754
know, strict, but fair. You know, I had respect for 
them. And so they, I think we ended up with two

14:36.239 --> 14:41.027
people in my unit Butch Gregory and myself that 
were on the drill team. Because I'd been in ROTC, I

14:47.028 --> 14:55.017
had some knowledge of those things, and I wasn't 
any good, but I was as good as anybody else. In those

14:56.258 --> 15:04.768
days, we had a lot of students from Central 
Catholic High School in San Antonio at A&M and in

14:56.258 --> 15:04.768
the Corps, a very large number. And I would 
estimate the final drill team we ended up with

15:05.589 --> 15:10.575
being around 40 people I bet 25 were from Central 
Catholic High School. And for a period of 10 or 12

15:16.158 --> 15:22.226
years, the commander was always from Central 
Catholic. And we pretty much began to pattern our

15:22.326 --> 15:27.694
drill after theirs. They had the drill team style 
that we ended up with first.

15:36.425 --> 15:38.990
You know, we made two or three little trips. We went 
to Laredo. We went to LSU. We went to the Battle of

15:43.618 --> 15:50.351
Flowers and Fiesta Fambo parades in San Antonio. 
You said Oklahoma State? No, LSU, Louisiana

15:52.287 --> 15:54.109
State. For a football game? No, it was a drill meet. 
It was just a separate, independent drill meet.

15:59.795 --> 16:01.017
Were there competitions? That was. And we were 
fair.

16:06.563 --> 16:14.031
But we beat the Jodies of Arlington for the first 
time that anybody remembered, and just in a

16:06.563 --> 16:14.031
parade. But they had an award for it. So they 
thought we were better than sliced bread because

16:16.402 --> 16:22.411
we were the first time anybody had beat them. And 
relative to the way the drill team business got

16:22.431 --> 16:35.772
pretty complicated in the later 60s and early 70s, 
we were low key. We had one senior advisor, and he

16:36.974 --> 16:44.586
was the wing commander and the RV commander. And 
the only time we ever saw him was if we happened to do

16:45.089 --> 16:54.601
a Jody for some reason against the RVs in some way, 
kind of smart-alecky. Well, the next day he'd show

16:55.061 --> 16:58.285
up and give us some advice. We had one junior 
advisor, and he turned out to be on the RVs. So we saw

17:05.254 --> 17:08.158
him about two or three times a week. I think we had 
four sophomores, three of whom were in my outfit.

17:13.372 --> 17:15.135
And all I remember is drilling. We had no monkey 
business of any kind. Where, when, how long did you

17:19.041 --> 17:21.805
all drill? We drilled normally 5 to 6.30 and then 
end up in late tables around 6.45 at Duncan. And you

17:31.419 --> 17:32.821
drilled over in the Duncan area? Well, no, we 
drilled on the parking lot at Guyon Hall. Oh. Right

17:37.621 --> 17:38.722
here at Rudder Tower. And then we would end up being 
on Simpson Drill Field, just the drill field then.

17:46.353 --> 17:50.799
As far as you were aware, what was the selection 
process? If you could drill. How did you know and

17:53.242 --> 17:55.064
they know? Well, they watched. I mean, there 
were... 1,400 people, freshmen, tried out for the

17:58.310 --> 18:02.363
drill team, and they ended up with 40. Oh, okay. 
Just by drilling. Okay. So there was a...

18:08.317 --> 18:10.640
selection and that was done about when? Oh it 
started about the second week of school and they

18:11.721 --> 18:26.781
had it thinned out to probably 90 or so by the end of 
the first semester and then grades would cause

18:11.721 --> 18:26.781
attrition and you would have probably 40. And it 
lasted all year? Lasted all year. Let's see on

18:31.728 --> 18:36.614
Corps trips y'all did not march separately did 
you? Only the last Corps trip They would march

18:38.506 --> 18:41.851
separately in the parade in Austin. I can remember 
doing that. But not, what about football games? At

18:49.762 --> 18:56.611
the very, usually the last home march in, you could 
at least march in. You were never good enough to do

18:57.312 --> 18:59.535
that. But no performance. Did you and other 
members become recognized within the Corps as

19:02.163 --> 19:08.813
being drill team members? Yes. Was that a plus? 
Yes, I think from all the military and respect

19:12.158 --> 19:17.406
purposes it was a plus. It probably didn't help my 
grades any. Did it get you out of any of the events

19:22.614 --> 19:28.543
that some outsiders might have called hazing? It 
might have, because I have, you know, I have almost

19:29.283 --> 19:43.281
no memory, you know, of the very many things, you 
know, that I think happened, you know, to me. You

19:43.882 --> 19:45.203
know, you can't ever say never. But, I mean, I can 
think of two or three times, but that's all. Can you

19:50.530 --> 19:51.311
describe those? And then as a sophomore, I 
remember none. Can you describe any of those

19:54.976 --> 19:57.879
freshman things here? Let me think. Whether it 
involved you or not, it doesn't matter. Well, when

20:00.978 --> 20:10.687
we were freshmen, they had a practice of, it was 
called stealing the commander's footlocker. And

20:11.968 --> 20:19.695
we did that and a few personal items and sent it to 
his girlfriend somewhere up around Waco. And then

20:20.476 --> 20:24.760
you would normally give it back at the Texas game. 
Even if it was in Austin, you still hauled it out

20:24.780 --> 20:28.163
there and sat it. on the field at Memorial Stadium, 
or you did it here. There was a little shenanigans

20:33.646 --> 20:38.832
related to that, but it just wasn't very much. I 
know since I've been here forever that some of

20:39.854 --> 20:51.147
those began to be highly ritualistic and pretty 
aggressive, and so we've had to have a very you

20:51.835 --> 20:55.479
know, active campaign of not allowing that kind of 
stuff. But I remember it in a good bull sense. Do you

20:58.582 --> 21:04.007
remember the victim of that theft giving you all 
any payback? Barked, well that's what I meant,

21:04.027 --> 21:06.169
where it was very little. You know, he barked a time 
or two. But he could say hello and you thought he was

21:08.571 --> 21:10.773
barking. I mean, he was a big guy. His name was Billy 
Mack McCutcheon. And I've seen him, you know, a

21:15.358 --> 21:17.520
handful of times. He ended up working for the 
extension service. But they had a pretty big

21:21.468 --> 21:24.335
presence. Seniors looked like they were pretty 
big and pretty old and pretty seasoned when you

21:25.237 --> 21:32.114
were a freshman. Describe the ritual in the dining 
halls. The dining halls, like I say, that's where

21:36.335 --> 21:42.104
most of the campusology questions and stuff took 
place. More than in, as much as in the dorm. And then

21:45.710 --> 21:49.876
if you screwed up, well then that's when you had to 
do something, you know, later. Or you didn't get to

21:50.597 --> 21:53.121
eat as much or whatever. There was, you were being 
fed, the waiter system, you know, that was still in

21:55.345 --> 22:03.237
effect. And so you had freshmen basically 
operated the table. You had meal service for the

22:11.077 --> 22:15.001
seniors and juniors at the table. And then you 
operated hot corner, which is where the food came

22:15.842 --> 22:20.306
in, in bowls. And you made sure it was all dumped up. 
And then after everybody had some, then the

22:23.049 --> 22:25.571
freshmen got it. But they brought food until you 
told them not to bring any more. And once the game

22:30.155 --> 22:33.038
was over, Freshmen could hang back as long as they 
wanted to. Nowadays, they eat in 12 minutes and

22:37.991 --> 22:43.977
they're gone out of the dining hall, which to me is 
still amazing. Because we, at night, we'd go in

22:44.658 --> 22:47.061
there at 6.30. The upperclassmen would usually be 
gone by 7 or 7.05. The fish didn't leave until about

22:52.787 --> 22:54.509
7.20. I mean, you would, there would be 500 fish in 
there getting food from every table in there and

22:54.609 --> 23:02.417
eating until you couldn't eat anymore. And then 
you'd get back to the dorm just in time for call to

23:02.937 --> 23:08.450
quarters, and everybody thought that was fine. 
They didn't bother you about it. Share some of the

23:11.859 --> 23:16.069
nicknames you remember for food items. Oh, bull 
neck and was meat and blood. Was bull meat, bull

23:21.197 --> 23:22.980
neck, was chicken? I think all meat. Yeah, I think 
it was all. I think it was. Blood was ketchup, sand

23:28.130 --> 23:37.028
and salt and pepper, cow's milk and sky's water. 
Were all desserts cush? All desserts were cush.

23:41.693 --> 23:43.615
You didn't get any cush as a fish. The exception was 
if the fish football team defeated the

23:45.596 --> 24:02.233
Shorthorns, which still existed when I was in 
school, then there was some kind of, I think,

23:45.596 --> 24:02.233
cherry pie or cherry cheesecake or something. 
There was something you could have. for the

24:03.687 --> 24:04.709
remainder of the year. The best dessert was Boston 
cream pie, and the odds of a freshman getting any of

24:05.972 --> 24:12.165
that was, you know, full zero. For some reason, the 
upperclassmen did not like bread pudding, and we

24:13.347 --> 24:21.544
would have so you got an entire platter for eight. 
of bread pudding as a fish. And fortunately, I

24:24.878 --> 24:28.142
still think it's wonderful. Only I've been to some 
places now that have really good bread pudding.

24:31.826 --> 24:34.629
What was your favorite dining hall food? Did you 
have any? That's a good question. I don't know that

24:39.495 --> 24:41.117
I would name one. Was there any that you didn't 
like? You wouldn't eat fried eggs on a bet. I mean,

24:47.904 --> 24:50.147
the eggs were know still moving you know if they 
were either scrambled or fried you know it didn't

24:50.482 --> 25:03.141
matter they were still kind of moving around so you 
wouldn't eat those which reminds me we did really

24:50.482 --> 25:03.141
like jelly fritters you know, which is basically 
old bread, you know, stuffed with some jelly and

25:03.509 --> 25:09.756
kind of fried. And those would be, you know, they 
were lapped up in short order. Recall, if you can,

25:16.342 --> 25:24.491
some of the pranks that you were aware of that were 
played at the dining hall. In the dining hall? It

25:26.493 --> 25:31.238
was fairly common on the nights that you had yell 
practice. in the evenings, which was two nights a

25:31.724 --> 25:43.011
week, usually things were pretty loose, fun, good 
time, and goofy stuff was going on. Maybe you had

25:43.893 --> 25:48.484
the meal under the table and everybody laughed and 
thought that was wonderful. or you might have had

25:48.903 --> 25:52.648
the meal off the table, just dumped the food on 
there. You probably had freshmen scurrying

25:54.050 --> 26:06.849
around under tables lighting bibs of 
upperclassmen and then trying to make sure you got

25:54.050 --> 26:06.849
away before it flared up. There was some kind of 
game that the upperclassmen played where there

26:06.869 --> 26:17.644
was a certain way to stack the silverware where you 
could pop a spoon or something and stick a fork in

26:06.869 --> 26:17.644
the ceiling. And I can't remember exactly how it 
was, but I have a pretty clear memory that we were

26:18.620 --> 26:29.226
real good at that and that that was fairly common. 
Did anybody ever try to put some kind of hot

26:34.583 --> 26:37.105
seasoning or anything in somebody else's food? 
Did y'all ever? I'm sure it happened, but my only

26:38.106 --> 26:46.694
memory of hot stuff is that if you, you know, 
buzzing was laughing. So if you had, especially a

26:46.714 --> 27:02.868
freshman, but it might have applied to a sophomore 
too, you know, just some reason get tickled and

26:46.714 --> 27:02.868
start laughing, well then they'd think you ought 
to eat some busberries, you know, which were the

26:46.714 --> 27:02.868
peppers that were always on the table. Mm-hmm. 
with that kind of hot sauce that's vinegar and

27:03.625 --> 27:10.112
peppers like you'd put on spinach. And then there 
was always hot sauce. There was the

27:13.756 --> 27:22.025
small bottles of hot sauce, Tabasco.

27:24.547 --> 27:27.891
Did you feel that freshman year that your outfit 
was a special group? If so, why? Yeah, I think so. We

27:33.158 --> 27:44.955
had pretty, like I say, significant turnover, but 
we had some people that I definitely do still know

27:33.158 --> 27:44.955
to this time. I think we must have been fairly laid 
back. I can remember some good times and basically

27:49.901 --> 27:58.253
everybody kind of doing their job, but I don't have 
any nasty memories. I

28:01.402 --> 28:17.355
have one guy that I think out of all those years that 
maybe didn't conduct himself as he might like to be

28:01.402 --> 28:17.355
judged today. Did you, that year, begin some 
friendships that have been a lifetime? Several.

28:26.718 --> 28:30.728
Typical day of classes, what did you wear and what 
was the routine? It was regular uniform. of the

28:32.995 --> 28:55.695
morning you would come back from breakfast and get 
your books and head out the door and I always seemed

28:32.995 --> 28:55.695
like I always had eight o'clock I liked that for 
myself because it fit me and then you would come

28:32.995 --> 28:55.695
back go to lunch formation and then in the 
afternoons you usually had a couple of hours where

28:55.996 --> 29:23.775
you weren't committed after three o'clock you 
might not be committed and then what'd you do

28:55.996 --> 29:23.775
regular unit had intramurals you know from 4 30 or 5 
till chow time but drill teams were replaced

28:55.996 --> 29:23.775
intramurals what did you do if you had any any 
non-scheduled hours during the day

28:55.996 --> 29:23.775
who knows run errands go to the post office And pray 
that Aunt Ruth had sent brownies. Go to the

29:28.578 --> 29:29.459
laundry. Might run a few little details for 
somebody around the dorm. They might like for you

29:33.967 --> 29:37.352
to get their laundry when you went to get yours. If 
you wanted to escape entirely from the core

29:37.813 --> 29:43.182
routine, was there a place? I would say it was just 
Cushing Library. And I didn't go there nearly

29:48.068 --> 29:56.898
enough, but it was quiet and there was no core 
activity that occurred in the library. The MSC, to

29:57.840 --> 30:05.108
me, was a little more formal in that there were a lot 
of upperclassmen using the MSC. So my perception

30:05.929 --> 30:10.755
was the freshmen used it if they had to. And the MSC 
really seemed like the true living room. It seemed

30:15.977 --> 30:17.098
like the living room. It did indeed. Did you meet 
Wayne Stark that year? Do you remember? Yeah, if I

30:23.906 --> 30:32.916
did, it would have just been at

30:23.906 --> 30:32.916
what's now known as MSC Open House, where they had a 
reception. And in those days, General Rutter and

30:33.056 --> 30:36.760
General Hannigan and Polly Stark and a few people 
shook hands with all of the freshmen. Of course, I

30:41.638 --> 30:51.167
guess there were 1,500

30:41.638 --> 30:51.167
to 2,000 freshmen, but I can remember that. 
Describe your first impressions of Earl Rudder.

30:54.971 --> 30:56.413
What did he look like, seem like? He was a fairly 
imposing man. Seemed formal but polite. I

31:06.592 --> 31:14.385
remember General Hannigan also seemed formal, 
but seemed very polite, just his manner. And I had

31:15.287 --> 31:30.152
an occasion to talk with him two or three times my 
freshman year on things, and he wrote notes

31:15.287 --> 31:30.152
incessantly, and he used great big
