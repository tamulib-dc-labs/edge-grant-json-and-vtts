00:02.377 --> 00:08.726
Someone to come in and take over a corporation that 
was $9 million in debt, that must have taken

00:02.377 --> 00:08.726
somewhat of a gambling spirit. Well, I was 34 years 
old, and at 34, I was willing to gamble more than I am

00:10.048 --> 00:16.918
today. Did it look like it was a better opportunity 
than staying with Lone Star Gas? Well, it did to me,

00:22.486 --> 00:26.752
and of course, it was a very fortunate move for me. 
But I... For a period of time, I did wonder whether I

00:30.878 --> 00:40.429
had made a mistake, because it was a long way back 
for a company that had to get started. I could

00:41.190 --> 00:42.571
imagine so, yes.

00:46.115 --> 00:57.949
What would you think would be some of the 
outstanding developments in your area of

00:46.115 --> 00:57.949
petroleum engineering, say, since 1938, that 
you've come to Shamrock? Well, of course, my

00:58.975 --> 01:05.442
experience in petroleum engineering was largely 
while I was with the Lone Star Gas Company. When I

01:06.323 --> 01:11.869
came with Diamond Shamrock, my experience was 
administrative management. But I imagine you

01:12.370 --> 01:17.135
kept up with the developments in the field to a 
certain extent anyway. Well, to tell you the

01:18.797 --> 01:26.586
truth, there's been so much progress made in that 
field that I hardly speak the language anymore.

01:30.329 --> 01:42.862
The science and engineering in the oil industry 
has advanced beyond belief over this period of

01:30.329 --> 01:42.862
time. You see, in my early experience in the oil 
business, waste was the rule rather than the

01:44.183 --> 01:55.915
exception. And there was an oversupply of both oil 
and gas. And when I came up to Amarillo to work for

02:03.261 --> 02:20.706
the Shamrock, oil was selling for 50 cents a barrel 
and gas at a penny a thousand cubic feet. And nobody

02:23.232 --> 02:30.020
gave much importance on reserves. For 
perspective, what's it selling for today? Well,

02:33.383 --> 02:45.937
the oil is selling for about $10 a barrel, and gas, 
intrastate gas, is selling for $1,000 and more.

02:47.018 --> 02:52.885
The interstate gas, the price is regulated by the 
Federal Power Commission has been adjusted

02:54.232 --> 03:02.623
upwards to 45,000 cents per thousand cubic feet. 
And there's not much gas available

03:03.824 --> 03:10.073
at that price. So it's an entirely new ballgame. 
And in my early experience in the... oil and gas

03:22.210 --> 03:28.796
business, mostly gas, while I was with the Lone 
Star Gas Company.

03:29.077 --> 03:49.416
I ran experiments and did a lot of development work 
in the field toward conservation of gas, to cut out

03:29.077 --> 03:49.416
the waste of gas, and wrote a number of papers on 
that subject

03:50.662 --> 03:56.210
during a time when no one seemed to be much 
interested in conserving gas. But those

03:57.372 --> 04:03.120
practices have developed to where now there's 
very little waste. I served as chairman of the

04:05.003 --> 04:18.863
engineering committee to study the panhandle 
waste during the period of time when it was legal to

04:05.003 --> 04:18.863
blow gas into the air to get the liquids out. 
There's some four billion cubic feet of gas wasted

04:19.754 --> 04:28.042
before they were able to get the laws passed to stop 
the waste. I testified in the Senate

04:28.062 --> 04:37.451
Investigating Committee and the coal committee 
from Congress investigating that waste. And

04:37.691 --> 04:48.782
finally, in 1935, they repealed the stripping law 
and cut out this large waste of gas. but the

04:49.606 --> 05:08.866
Railroad Commission had many, many lawsuits from 
people resisting the law and challenging the law

04:49.606 --> 05:08.866
before they ever were able to establish their 
conservation rules and regulations. In a way, I

05:08.886 --> 05:18.195
guess you could say that between, say, 1938 and 
now, the biggest change has been, outside of the

05:08.886 --> 05:18.195
increased technology, would be that earlier it 
was a product looking for a market, and today it's a

05:18.479 --> 05:23.286
market looking for a product. Well, that's true. 
That substantially tells the whole story. And

05:30.076 --> 05:41.592
when a commodity becomes valuable, then the 
industry itself will eliminate the waste because

05:30.076 --> 05:41.592
it pays them to do so.

05:44.636 --> 05:47.220
I think the most recent Our last two former student 
directories have you in and listed as being

05:47.521 --> 05:53.930
involved in ranching and investments. When did 
you get into ranching? About nearly 15 years ago.

05:59.016 --> 06:16.920
And

05:59.016 --> 06:16.920
10

05:59.016 --> 06:16.920
or 12 years ago,

05:59.016 --> 06:16.920
when I was getting ready for retirement, I 
realized that I would have to have something to

06:17.913 --> 06:23.919
keep me busy. I was interested in ranching, and 
I've been, although this is not a good year in

06:23.959 --> 06:37.592
ranching on account of the drought, it's been a 
good occupation, a very interesting occupation.

06:37.612 --> 06:41.896
Well, I can imagine where the drought would, 
drought has been bad in a lot of places, I think. My

06:42.417 --> 06:45.540
father has a small piece of property and runs about 
50 cows, and In addition, I guess, to the drought,

06:46.094 --> 06:49.777
there's been a pretty drastic drop in price, 
hasn't there? Yes. Well, from last year to this

06:50.758 --> 06:57.685
year, it's just about a little less than half of 
what it was last year to the producer. Of course,

06:59.426 --> 07:06.073
there are many problems

06:59.426 --> 07:06.073
from the cost standpoint. Feed prices have 
doubled in the last year, and the cattle prices

07:07.154 --> 07:15.021
have halved. But these cycles have a way of working 
themselves around. The most serious problem

07:21.169 --> 07:33.085
right now in the cattle business is the drought,

07:21.169 --> 07:33.085
the inability to grow the grass that you need, so 
you have to buy more feed.

07:36.090 --> 07:39.334
My father's property is in Lee County, Texas. In 
that area, almost everybody that has any cattle

07:39.394 --> 07:45.042
has a stock pond. or two or three for their cattle 
for drinking water. How do you provide water for

07:48.836 --> 07:50.617
your cows? Do you have a stockpile? I have both. I 
have numerous windmills and surface tanks, but

07:53.300 --> 08:01.788
the surface tanks are all practically dry right 
now. And when the wind doesn't blow, and that's

08:03.550 --> 08:14.421
seldom in the panhandle, but right now it hadn't 
been blowing so much, and I was at the ranch

08:03.550 --> 08:14.421
yesterday, and The windmills weren't turning, 
and the surface tanks were dry, and so I began to

08:15.076 --> 08:27.292
wonder if it was going to rain soon enough, I was 
going to have to move some cattle. I can imagine. By

08:28.674 --> 08:30.296
moving, you mean selling them. I'll move them to 
other pastures where I still have water. I see.

08:33.981 --> 08:44.014
Well, I know it was somewhat of a shock to my wife 
yesterday when we were driving along, and I told

08:33.981 --> 08:44.014
her that shortly we'd be crossing the Red River, 
and she was very disappointed to see that it was

08:33.981 --> 08:44.014
dry. Yeah. I've seen the Red River on a flood basis. 
I had to come to Amarillo one time when I was a Lone

08:51.920 --> 08:56.705
Star guest. I was at one of these hearings, and they 
had every railroad bridge and every

08:56.725 --> 09:09.321
highway bridge between here and Vernon was washed 
out. And so the Red River is not always dry. I'm sure

09:16.231 --> 09:17.854
it's not. Since you graduated from A&M, I think 
you've kept a fairly close tie with the school. I

09:25.046 --> 09:27.249
believe at one point you served on the board, did 
you not? Yes, from 1953 to 59.

09:32.618 --> 09:42.475
What would you say would be the most significant 
developments that occurred at that period in

09:32.618 --> 09:42.475
A&M's history? Well, it's a little hard since 
progress is to be effective as a continuous thing.

09:51.516 --> 10:11.466
It's a little hard to pinpoint it, but I served as 
chairman of the building committee and we didn't

09:51.516 --> 10:11.466
have as much money to spend as we needed to build 
these new buildings as fast as we'd like to have had

10:11.581 --> 10:15.467
them. Our income from the permanent fund was a good 
deal less than it is today, and so we established a

10:15.487 --> 10:37.521
priority list,

10:15.487 --> 10:37.521
the board of directors did, and we reviewed that 
from time to time, and we took these buildings that

10:15.487 --> 10:37.521
we constructed during that period of time in the 
order of priorities established by the board of

10:39.053 --> 10:45.420
directors. Now, I see today how

10:45.441 --> 11:07.947
much better A&M can function with the facilities 
that they have been able to establish,

10:45.441 --> 11:07.947
particularly in the last decade. that

11:08.635 --> 11:36.617
you can see the effect that quality not only in 
staff personnel but quality in facilities will do

11:08.635 --> 11:36.617
for attracting students when you see that A&M is 
facing its greatest enrollment of its history

11:08.635 --> 11:36.617
this year. So I'd say that I hope that we got some of 
these things headed in the right direction. I'm

11:46.453 --> 11:56.348
very proud of the fact that Darryl Rudder came 
during the time that I was on the board of

11:46.453 --> 11:56.348
directors, and he had a great deal of vision. And we 
charted the courses that were expanded and

12:04.525 --> 12:10.633
improved upon later for the progress that's been 
made. And I might say that I couldn't have a higher

12:11.354 --> 12:24.592
regard for the job that Jack Williams is doing as 
president of the school now. He has the vision, and

12:24.692 --> 12:32.102
he was able to take over and continue and actually 
accelerate the progress in these directions that

12:32.521 --> 12:39.288
have been established. And it's all based on 
quality. And I hope we never lose it. Well, I do too.

12:46.175 --> 12:54.864
I've certainly been impressed in the three years 
that I've been there, because I have known of A&M

12:46.175 --> 12:54.864
for many years, having grown up 60 miles south of 
there. But it certainly strikes me as being a

12:56.606 --> 13:01.971
quality institution. and

13:02.407 --> 13:26.792
I think is exemplified by one of the things which 
Dr. Williams has said when our former librarian

13:02.407 --> 13:26.792
decided, you know, Jack Smith decided to take a job 
in New York, that Dr. Williams did not say, as some

13:02.407 --> 13:26.792
people would have said, well, we've got X number of 
dollars. We'll find us a librarian who will come to

13:26.812 --> 13:29.595
work for that. indicated that we would find the 
librarian we wanted, and then we would pay

13:29.862 --> 13:36.171
whatever was necessary to get that person to come. 
And I don't know whether you know who the new

13:37.353 --> 13:40.557
librarian is or not. It's a lady from Ohio State. 
No, I haven't met him. And I believe that at least

13:45.224 --> 13:55.458
the people in the library are almost universally 
pleased with the choice. Of course, the people in

13:55.539 --> 13:57.962
the library were very much involved in making this 
choice, which I think also is a good move on behalf

13:58.330 --> 14:10.287
of the president, that the people under whom this 
person would work would have a choice in choosing

13:58.330 --> 14:10.287
that person. Well, it – Jack Williams' whole 
philosophy and his execution of his principles

14:25.567 --> 14:27.809
please me very much. He's a man who can handle 
people, a man who has the vision he needs and the

14:27.909 --> 14:43.483
educational background that he needs, and I just 
hope he stays healthy and stays there and have a

14:27.909 --> 14:43.483
long time. Well, I think there are a lot of people 
who support you in that feeling, Mr. Dunn, and I

14:43.924 --> 14:48.628
know I do.

14:52.852 --> 14:54.493
I would imagine that the The naming of the 
dormitory for you must have been kind of a

14:55.030 --> 15:00.336
highlight of your career. Yes, it was, and a total 
surprise.

15:05.963 --> 15:19.098
President Williams called me one day and asked me 
if I would give my permission for him to name a

15:05.963 --> 15:19.098
dormitory after me, just out of the blue sky. And I 
said, well, I'd be highly honored. So that's the

15:22.201 --> 15:24.784
way it took place. Well, I had never heard anybody 
explain how it took place other than the fact that

15:25.709 --> 15:35.462
the board announced that they were naming one dorm 
for you and one dorm for Mr. Kruger. And I know he was

15:36.263 --> 15:37.806
very much pleased. I think he said that was the 
highlight of his life. The day he spent there

15:43.674 --> 15:48.460
during the dedication ceremonies, I guess. Yes. 
Were you able to? Yes, I was there. With all of my

15:54.650 --> 16:20.758
folks

15:54.650 --> 16:20.758
okay I have tried to make a good citizen and I have 
been engaged in a good many civic and other

15:54.650 --> 16:20.758
activities but the one of the outside activities 
that I am proud of is the opportunity I had to serve

16:21.869 --> 16:34.842
on the Governors Committee of 25 to study the 
education beyond the high school. It took 14

16:34.922 --> 16:36.964
months. Another experience that I had that was 
very satisfying to me was the job that I had as

16:36.984 --> 16:50.458
chairman of the Century Committee to study A&M's 
program for the future. And after another 14

16:56.019 --> 17:11.333
months, we submitted a plan to the board of 
directors, which has been a

16:56.019 --> 17:11.333
good eel of it, has been accomplished, and has 
taken place today. So you feel like that when you

17:12.074 --> 17:19.281
have the opportunity for that experience, you do 
have some small parts. and the progress that has

17:19.919 --> 17:25.305
taken place. Somewhere, and I'm not sure from 
whose office it came, we were able to pick up

17:25.325 --> 17:32.853
several boxes of records of the Century Council. I 
have looked at them rather hurriedly, I guess I

17:33.433 --> 17:39.199
should say. Do you remember right offhand what the 
origin of the name Century Council was? The origin

17:49.332 --> 18:03.807
was that by the A&M's 100th birthday, they wanted 
to set a goal to accomplish at the end of the

17:49.332 --> 18:03.807
century, the first century of its history. I see. I 
had it somehow in the back of my mind that it was the

18:05.049 --> 18:12.977
century of the Morrill Act, which was in 62 was the 
centennial of the Morrill Act. We gave our report

18:13.858 --> 18:15.880
15. 15 years ahead of A&M's 100th birthday. Now 
then, the 100th birthday is coming, more than 10

18:21.012 --> 18:27.078
years of that's passed. So it's coming up, I 
believe it's 1876. Yeah, I believe the centennial

18:34.066 --> 18:38.210
year is officially to be January through December 
of 76. Yes. So we will be in our 100th year of

18:38.931 --> 18:42.795
classes, but will, in a sense, be riding the 
coattails of the U.S. bicentennial, which is 200

18:43.096 --> 18:56.595
years

18:43.096 --> 18:56.595
for the United States Declaration of 
Independence.

19:00.020 --> 19:07.009
So you were making a plan for the future that would 
be accomplished by the centennial. The theme of

19:07.029 --> 19:12.597
our whole study was a plan for excellence. and

19:12.796 --> 19:25.467
we divided our Century Council into

19:12.796 --> 19:25.467
groups, committees. Each one held and recorded 
all of the proceedings of every meeting, the pros

19:26.488 --> 19:42.482
and the cons, and each committee made its report to 
the council as a whole Then the council as a whole

19:43.171 --> 19:50.499
voted on it, voted for it or against it. So through 
that process, we were able to compile a consensus

19:51.320 --> 19:59.429
report with no minority report brevity. Who 
appointed the Century Council? They were

20:05.055 --> 20:08.959
nominated from all over the state.

20:11.723 --> 20:16.749
They had some 1,200 nominations.

20:16.769 --> 20:27.841
And

20:16.769 --> 20:27.841
I'm not sure, but that the board of directors 
selected them from those nominations. I believe

20:27.901 --> 20:29.042
that's the way it was. And it was the board then who 
named you chairman of the council. Well, possibly

20:33.387 --> 20:35.850
the board. Earl Rudder called me and asked me to 
take the job. I would imagine on something like

20:41.913 --> 20:49.663
that, at least the board would have approved the 
selection, if not make it indeed, if they didn't

20:41.913 --> 20:49.663
indeed make it themselves. Yes. Well, that was... 
As I said, I have not had the opportunity to

20:51.546 --> 21:02.961
thoroughly examine all the records, but I know 
that there's some correspondence files there,

20:51.546 --> 21:02.961
and I think there are some copies of the final 
report there. But every... I'd rather imagine

21:05.164 --> 21:11.633
some... Every session was taped and transcribed. 
and distributed to the members of the group. And

21:17.714 --> 21:27.769
then we had ample discussion, pro and con, on all of 
these factors

21:17.714 --> 21:27.769
for consideration. And it was a hard-working 
group. We had a high attendance record, and we...

21:40.486 --> 21:43.169
tried to do a good job, and I think we did. Well, that 
certainly looks as though you did. As you said,

21:45.431 --> 21:59.367
most of the things which the Century Council 
recommended had been accomplished, and A&M has

21:45.431 --> 21:59.367
certainly shown a substantial amount of 
development in both quantity and quality. I was

21:59.707 --> 22:07.776
real proud of a communication I got from Jack 
Williams on the 10th anniversary of the Century

21:59.707 --> 22:07.776
Council report. And he detailed specifics on what 
had been recommended and what had been

22:09.089 --> 22:17.817
accomplished in that 10 years. Yeah, was this a 
published brochure? Yes, it was. I believe I got

22:23.282 --> 22:25.004
one of those for the archives, too. I'm trying to 
collect all of these publications that come out as

22:25.044 --> 22:30.109
much as possible. And anything that records 
anything of significance, I try to collect the

22:30.209 --> 22:36.475
copies. Sometimes it's a little bit difficult to 
find out where to get them, but usually with a

22:39.177 --> 22:44.108
little perseverance you can do that.
