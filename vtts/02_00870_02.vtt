WEBVTT

00:04.621 --> 00:25.412
Basically,

00:04.621 --> 00:25.412
the curriculum follows the generalist with a 
specialty model, which originally was described

00:04.621 --> 00:25.412
by Harvey Perloff. So that was never really 
changed. So there's always been a fairly large

00:28.256 --> 00:31.641
core seven or eight courses. And then maybe about 
five specialty areas that students are supposed

00:36.339 --> 00:46.195
to pick from the, I think they take like four 
courses in each one. And some of the content of

00:47.717 --> 00:49.981
these changed. With the curriculum review there 
was some change. Now they may have made some

00:52.204 --> 00:58.414
substantial changes since I left. I'm not real up 
to date on it. The program is very heavy in

01:00.730 --> 01:06.598
quantitative methods. Terry Kahn teaches two 
semester sequence, which is required. And then I

01:11.906 --> 01:22.081
taught a course in more applied methods, which 
really dealt with things like population and

01:11.906 --> 01:22.081
economic forecasting. Terry's courses were 
pretty strictly statistics and calculus and

01:22.441 --> 01:27.328
linear programming. And he's a very popular 
teacher. So those actually, many years, those got

01:29.815 --> 01:38.405
the highest evaluations of all the courses in the 
curriculum. And then Terry, while I was there,

01:38.725 --> 01:46.053
Dean Box started a teaching award, teaching 
prize. And I guess the last year I was there, I think

01:46.574 --> 01:57.045
in 81, Terry got the teaching award for the School 
of Architecture, which I think Dean Box got $1,000

01:46.574 --> 01:57.045
cash. award to go with it. He always seemed to be 
able to get money. We want to give $500 every year

02:02.270 --> 02:05.674
for this. Will you sign up to do it for the rest of 
your life? So

02:10.520 --> 02:16.146
I think that's true. And then I remember the 
change. We put in an economics course. We made that

02:19.350 --> 02:20.452
required. And Sandy Rosenblum had been teaching 
that for several years. There's not really a lot of

02:24.336 --> 02:27.420
theory in it. You don't have a theory course? Well, 
we had an urban and regional theory course. Who

02:32.658 --> 02:34.300
taught that? I taught it for about two years. I kind 
of taught regional economics. But then Pat

02:39.929 --> 02:44.355
Salinas-Wilson taught it. And she's a radical 
planner. And she used kind of Marxist-type

02:48.582 --> 02:51.526
material and all. So she did a quite different 
thing.

02:56.088 --> 02:58.310
Neither is taught as a quantitative course. So 
it's not really a regional science type course. If

03:05.198 --> 03:13.766
you consider regional science to be 
mathematically oriented, which they of course do

03:05.198 --> 03:13.766
at the Association of Regional Scientists. Yeah, 
they say Tom Reiner is famous as the only

03:13.967 --> 03:22.736
non-quantitative regional scientist.

03:22.856 --> 03:22.956
Yeah. Well, okay, so you had, and then what did 
Peter Koltman teach? Well, Peter,

03:29.435 --> 03:47.899
let's see, when I, he had kind of his own group of 
courses when,

03:29.435 --> 03:47.899
when I arrived there, the several were 
environmental planning area, and they were kind

03:29.435 --> 03:47.899
of Ian McHarr type courses. They were landscape 
analysis, and then he had, I think one in English

03:52.400 --> 04:07.975
planning and one in New Towns, something kind of 
based upon some of his own experience,

03:52.400 --> 04:07.975
which I guess maybe some of it was in South Africa, 
maybe some in Great Britain. You'd have to kind of

04:07.995 --> 04:10.317
tell me about that. And those, apparently one 
time, those were quite popular. But at the time I

04:13.600 --> 04:21.748
arrived there, the enrollment got very low in 
those courses, and people weren't interested in

04:13.600 --> 04:21.748
New Towns anymore. And so his courses had changed 
quite a bit. And eventually, he put in a studio, a

04:26.160 --> 04:34.474
two semester studio as a terminal option. And he 
taught that course. And he was doing that when I

04:38.280 --> 04:40.143
left him. Originally, everybody had to do a 
thesis. And they had the same problem. that half

04:45.893 --> 04:48.957
the people never finished. So then they put in a 
professional report, which was supposed to be an

04:49.898 --> 04:55.604
easier version. And I think it only gave three 
hours credit. And that helped a little, but

05:01.731 --> 05:06.477
there's still a third of the students were never 
finishing. That's what we have now. Well, it's not

05:09.840 --> 05:12.964
too bad. So we finally decided to put in a third 
option, which was to take a studio course, because

05:13.315 --> 05:23.692
there had never been a required studio in the time I 
was there. That's interesting, because A&M was

05:25.415 --> 05:29.783
always- For so many years, there wasn't a single 
studio course. A&M was always required, too.

05:31.786 --> 05:35.472
Yeah.

05:35.492 --> 05:39.559
Okay, so Peter Coleman had been teaching that 
studio course for a while. And also he taught, I

05:41.378 --> 05:45.844
think, an undergraduate architecture course. 
They were always trying to make sure that each of

05:46.565 --> 05:56.878
the specialties had a qualified person in it. And 
that was always important in picking the faculty.

05:59.861 --> 06:02.425
And transportation planning was always one of the 
specialties. And that was one reason why they

06:02.765 --> 06:05.108
hired me. Sandy Rosenblum also teaches in 
transportation, but she's non-quantitative,

06:05.982 --> 06:12.512
basically non-technical. She has a PhD in 
political science from UCLA. And so her courses

06:19.122 --> 06:27.614
are very policy-oriented, and they deal with 
legal background and social issues. So she's

06:28.716 --> 06:35.466
always taught at least one transportation 
course, which particularly interest.

06:38.055 --> 06:39.718
Paratransit is one. She's one of the leading 
experts on taxis in the country. And she's dealt a

06:44.804 --> 06:50.451
lot of transportation to the elderly and 
handicapped. I taught the more technical and

06:50.491 --> 06:54.336
quantitative transportation courses. There was 
also an option in environmental planning. And we

07:00.745 --> 07:06.432
finally decided that Peter Coleman really didn't 
have a kind of background. To do that adequately,

07:07.137 --> 07:13.305
he didn't really have any biology background, any 
natural science. So we went out specifically

07:14.487 --> 07:19.394
looking for someone while I was there, and we hired 
Ken Butler. He came from Wisconsin. I

07:23.159 --> 07:28.647
thought he was an outstanding faculty member. He 
developed like four new courses. and

07:31.673 --> 07:33.995
environmental planning that we'd never had 
before.

07:38.279 --> 07:39.941
There was a policy course. There were technical 
courses. He did one in coastal zone management,

07:42.863 --> 07:50.931
which I think he finally had a job because the 
federal government killed the program and it

07:42.863 --> 07:50.931
became irrelevant. But he did that. And he worked 
in Galveston and Corpus Christi and some of those

07:53.413 --> 07:57.096
places. He did some consulting on that. And he, 
after I left, he got tenure. And then Gus went with

08:04.090 --> 08:08.798
the lower Colorado River Authority, whatever. I 
don't know what's happened to him. He's still

08:11.002 --> 08:11.583
there. He's still there, I think. We also had 
Maureen McReynolds sometimes taught a course,

08:14.948 --> 08:23.463
who was the City of Austin's Director of 
Environmental Management. They always had... A

08:25.640 --> 08:27.423
few practitioners that would teach. Sometimes if 
there was a temporary vacancy, we'd bring in

08:27.583 --> 08:32.612
practitioners. Dick Lilly was taught regularly 
for all the time I was there. First one course a

08:37.901 --> 08:41.427
year, and then later a course every semester. What 
did he teach? He taught a, it was kind of a course in

08:43.510 --> 08:49.420
the master plan. Basically, I think that was the 
course he taught every year was I think they

08:50.497 --> 08:57.948
basically went through the process of how to 
prepare a master plan.

09:03.056 --> 09:09.686
That sort of leads into this discussion with the 
relationship between architecture and

09:03.056 --> 09:09.686
planning. Since the planning faculty at Texas you 
know, went to a lot of lengths to distance

09:15.995 --> 09:21.903
themselves from old-fashioned physical 
planning. And the same thing is going on in Kansas,

09:23.265 --> 09:25.628
too. And I guess many schools... Well, it happened 
in Berkeley for a while. Yes. Well, it's probably

09:35.041 --> 09:37.224
still going on. I don't know if it's resolved or 
complex or not. So, part of this... manifested

09:45.087 --> 09:51.656
itself in Austin and basically this huge division 
between the architecture faculty and the

09:45.087 --> 09:51.656
planning faculty. They kind of ignored each 
other. And while I was there, we were in different

09:53.398 --> 09:57.524
buildings. The planning faculty was all in Sutton 
Hall. Most of the architecture faculty were in the

10:03.712 --> 10:08.158
old building, which I think now is called 
Goldsmith Hall. And certainly the dean's office

10:10.821 --> 10:15.027
was in Goldsmith Hall, so we never saw him. And I 
guess that Peter Colvin was in kind of an awkward

10:17.335 --> 10:30.190
position because he was one of the old fashioned 
types and he was sort of caught in the middle and

10:17.335 --> 10:30.190
wasn't really successful as a bridge. Also a lot of 
it had to do with trying to get away from the image of

10:30.991 --> 10:40.122
Hugo Leipziger Pierce. And these people that were 
there when I was there, felt that he had given a very

10:44.875 --> 10:48.779
bad image to the planning program in Austin. And 
they wanted to make sure everybody was different.

10:54.386 --> 11:07.701
Now, I don't

10:54.386 --> 11:07.701
know enough about what went on, but I understand 
Hugo kind of promoted the 701 program throughout

10:54.386 --> 11:07.701
the state of Texas. And I think he had a huge 
collection of 701 master plans that he gave to the

11:07.961 --> 11:13.768
library in Austin and all. But as I said, some of the 
younger people who came along, they kind of

11:15.740 --> 11:24.449
emphasized there was a social science type 
curriculum. You would call it a word curriculum. I

11:27.092 --> 11:31.476
don't know how to say that, because they emphasize 
the quantitative methods a lot, too. So it's words

11:31.496 --> 11:33.959
and numbers, but not much drawing. So there's very 
little of that. We'll try to change that back some.

11:39.044 --> 11:40.586
It's not a matter of drawing, though. My point is 
not that. It's a matter of that. sooner or later,

11:43.178 --> 11:47.142
decision makers are going to have to make 
vocational choices. And they can't do it on the

11:47.943 --> 11:51.807
basis of simply a lot of policies. They've got to 
have something a bit more definitive than that.

11:57.272 --> 12:00.556
And I think that that's Jack Kent's point, too. The 
problem with Jack Kent, as I see it, is he forgets

12:02.297 --> 12:09.104
the social and economic inputs to it, pretty much. 
Not entirely. very interested in drawing a firm

12:12.507 --> 12:15.390
boundary. I never agreed with him on that. In fact, 
even back in 1958, 59, most of the students

12:18.754 --> 12:25.361
disagreed with him. Yeah. Well, he knows I do, too, 
and we're having problems. I thought Jack was very

12:31.287 --> 12:38.235
fair that you could write an essay that took the 
opposite position from Jack's. If you thought it

12:38.515 --> 12:40.337
was a good essay, he'd give you an A. He didn't 
insist the students agreed with him. Well, he's

12:47.069 --> 12:48.991
changing a little bit. Well, let me, let's see, get 
back to Texas and let's see. Well, yeah, the

12:55.819 --> 13:02.646
organization is a little strange because the 
planning program doesn't really fit in anywhere.

13:03.347 --> 13:06.451
Basically, there's a school of architecture. 
There is no department of architecture. There's

13:08.553 --> 13:10.155
no program in architecture. And actually, Hal Box 
is the head of architecture. But then there is this

13:14.594 --> 13:18.440
other little thing, which is the community 
planning program. It's a program. It's a program.

13:21.724 --> 13:24.008
And it doesn't have control of its own budget, does 
it? No, it doesn't. That's controlled out of the

13:27.012 --> 13:29.235
dean's office. Yes, it's done out of the dean's 
office. So you don't really have a department

13:31.698 --> 13:33.781
head. Terry Kahn does not function as a department 
head. No, he's not a department head. He's a

13:38.628 --> 13:39.990
program director? Yes, I think that's right. Now, 
this is not unusual, not to have all this autonomy.

13:51.229 --> 13:54.855
But basically, they're in a completely anomalous 
position. They're just an oddity. And you see here

13:56.758 --> 14:04.189
in Kansas right now, we don't have departments. 
We're in a college of architecture. There are

14:06.818 --> 14:08.260
three programs. There's planning, there's 
architecture, and there's architectural

14:08.320 --> 14:13.348
engineering. But we're equal. We each have our own 
director, or I guess it's called chair now, and we

14:15.071 --> 14:23.365
each have the same limitations with regard to 
autonomy. But that's not true in Texas. You see,

14:27.111 --> 14:28.573
architecture... is it, except there's this 
little, you know, little boil on the surface of the

14:29.347 --> 14:41.403
skin of the program, which is planning, and it just 
doesn't fit in anywhere. Yeah. So you're always

14:43.545 --> 14:46.009
sort of a stepchild. Yeah. And I don't know, I think 
the accreditation visit came up after I left, and

14:47.951 --> 14:56.342
you say this was a source of problems. I can believe 
that's true. I understand from faculty at UT

14:59.570 --> 15:06.838
Arlington that they do not expect to be 
reaccredited. Either Austin doesn't or

15:08.701 --> 15:10.403
Arlington doesn't? Arlington. Arlington is 
quite small. It might not have enough faculty.

15:15.008 --> 15:25.740
Well, I think it has to do with resources and with 
administrative structure, too.

15:25.761 --> 15:27.062
So anyway,

15:29.540 --> 15:36.326
We always complain at A&M about things, but by 
comparison, I guess that our structure is

15:29.540 --> 15:36.326
extremely clear. Well, that's really pretty 
hazy. And Hal Box never went to graduate school.

15:46.216 --> 15:49.259
He just has a Bachelor of Architecture and then 
went into practice. So he has always had a lot of

15:50.520 --> 15:56.205
trouble understanding what planning was doing. 
And I don't think he understands too much what goes

15:57.029 --> 15:59.933
on in graduate school.

16:03.018 --> 16:07.944
So OK, well, Terry Kahn never studied planning. 
But he is from Texas. And I think got his bachelor's

16:12.972 --> 16:20.022
and master's in the business school of Texas. And 
then went to Berkeley and got a PhD. And was

16:23.667 --> 16:26.631
involved in the real estate program at Berkeley. 
And basically, he knows a lot about real estate and

16:26.999 --> 16:32.246
teaches courses that deal with that. He's very 
loyal to the private sector. He probably studied

16:34.949 --> 16:37.673
under Paul Wendt in the real estate research. 
That's quite possible. But he was always kind of a

16:39.074 --> 16:43.460
specialist in quantitative methods. So while his 
degree says something like land economics or real

16:43.480 --> 16:56.196
estate, he was almost really a student of 
quantitative methods. So he teaches, as I say,

16:56.581 --> 17:00.906
both those methods courses, which are very 
popular. And then his other courses usually have

17:01.727 --> 17:10.779
to do with land use, but tend to be not from the 
regulatory viewpoint, but from the developer

17:01.727 --> 17:10.779
viewpoint. A lot of students are interested in 
that. I mean, we always had quite a few students who

17:13.863 --> 17:19.169
were going into planning because they wanted to 
become millionaires. I don't know how it is at A&M.

17:22.433 --> 17:26.098
Well, we have a new degree, the Master of Science in 
Land Development. Which takes care of that.

17:27.458 --> 17:29.421
Formally recognized it. Yeah, it's a specialty 
master of science degree. I want to ask you, at UT

17:33.467 --> 17:40.899
Austin, are the students required to have an 
internship? No. I don't think very many schools

17:43.263 --> 17:47.409
require that because they can't place the 
students. We do. You do require them? Oh, yes.

17:50.615 --> 17:54.060
Well, do they get paid for the internships? Yes, 
they get paid about $1,200 a month.

18:00.994 --> 18:08.821
No, I think most programs gave that up when it 
became hard to find jobs.

18:08.841 --> 18:09.782
So they don't. They did give some academic credit 
for people who worked. They gave up to nine hours,

18:13.466 --> 18:16.208
even. Oh, we only give two. The only exceptions to 
that are some of our international students. who

18:23.740 --> 18:33.630
would not benefit by American practice

18:23.740 --> 18:33.630
or would have trouble finding an internship 
because they're not citizens. McClure came

18:33.670 --> 18:38.354
along, and his own particular specialty was 
planning law. We didn't really have anybody to

18:39.495 --> 18:41.778
teach that before. But when we changed the 
curriculum, we made that a required course. Of

18:47.363 --> 18:53.629
course, everybody likes to have their subject 
required.

18:54.065 --> 18:55.967
And he apparently did very well in that. He knew the 
subject very thoroughly. Then he also taught an

18:58.070 --> 19:04.998
elective seminar in growth management.

19:05.018 --> 19:14.430
So that was kind of the area that he went in for a 
while.

19:14.450 --> 19:14.911
All right. Well, let me talk about the students a 
little bit. There are a lot of very good students at

19:19.556 --> 19:23.481
Austin. And there are a lot of people who want to 
come to Texas, of course. And a lot of them

19:29.497 --> 19:31.560
particularly want to come to Austin. So they 
probably get better students than they deserve to

19:32.561 --> 19:35.284
have. They have a lot of people with Ivy League 
degrees, and people from the Big Ten, and Pacific

19:35.885 --> 19:45.196
Coast schools, and so forth. Not a whole lot of 
foreign students. That was fairly small.

19:48.580 --> 19:54.447
Probably the best student I ever had there was an 
Italian student, including He's English, which

19:54.595 --> 19:56.277
is very good.

20:01.164 --> 20:03.067
Most of the applicants are from Texas. I would say 
at least half of the people are living in Austin

20:03.087 --> 20:08.114
already at the time they applied the program. A lot 
of them are Northeasterners or Midwesterners who

20:09.215 --> 20:17.367
have come down there and lived in Austin for a year 
or two and decided to go to graduate school. There

20:19.189 --> 20:21.953
are also a lot of other applications from around 
Texas. I would say at least two-thirds of the

20:22.642 --> 20:26.327
applications are from Texas. And the others are 
all kind of scattered. There are quite a few from

20:33.017 --> 20:37.243
Southern California, I think. There seem to be 
quite a few students. Where do they go after they

20:40.067 --> 20:42.471
get their degrees? Well, of course, they go all 
over. But the majority of them work in Texas. It

20:48.600 --> 20:52.345
seems like that most of them want to stay in Austin. 
I mean, almost everybody loves Austin. And all the

20:56.582 --> 21:01.748
agencies in Austin have quite a few of them there. 
But they're kind of scattered around Texas.

21:09.878 --> 21:13.502
I guess there are a few in the Houston area. I think 
there are probably more in the Dallas-Fort Worth

21:13.522 --> 21:17.447
area. But some of them go all around the country, 
too. Do they generally take government-type

21:19.831 --> 21:23.755
planning jobs or in the private sector? Or how does 
it fall? I think there's more interest in the

21:24.416 --> 21:28.240
private sector than in most planning schools. As I 
say, there are quite a few that are

21:28.740 --> 21:32.725
money-oriented. There are some whose fathers are 
developers. And we've had

21:37.570 --> 21:49.062
some, according to rumor, some of the students, 
their fathers were worth tens of millions of

21:37.570 --> 21:49.062
dollars. all made in land use development. Well, I 
hope they still have it with the turndown. Yeah, I

21:56.877 --> 21:58.239
don't know about that. So I would say that the 
majority do go into the public sector jobs. But I

22:03.385 --> 22:09.453
think there's probably a larger number that are 
interested in the private sector than in the

22:03.385 --> 22:09.453
typical planning program. There's one question I 
have to ask about the program in closing. And that

22:15.180 --> 22:17.783
is, I have heard it rumored that there is no history 
of planning course at the University of Texas at

22:18.353 --> 22:24.723
Austin. No, I don't think so. You mean a whole 
course in the history of planning? No, there's no

22:29.671 --> 22:31.574
course like that. Shocking. I don't think, most 
programs, we don't have a course like that at

22:32.516 --> 22:36.682
Kansas either. Shocking. Well, I can come up and 
teach it. Well, of course. A fellow at Ohio State is

22:44.273 --> 22:47.239
doing that on a contract basis. Yeah, Larry 
Gerkins. Larry Gerkins, right. He's very good.

22:50.064 --> 22:52.589
Yes, he came out to Kansas City last fall. Yeah, 
he's excellent. Okay. Some of the students have

22:58.420 --> 23:00.023
done very well. I guess Sally Shipman is one of the 
most successful students. It happened... I guess

23:07.274 --> 23:11.518
about... Sally Shipman is currently a city 
council person in Austin. It happens about, I

23:11.538 --> 23:30.978
think it was about four years ago, I was nominated 
to run for the National Board of Directors of APA,

23:11.538 --> 23:30.978
and when I asked, I guess Ed Stolman called me up, 
and I asked who was running against me, and they

23:11.538 --> 23:30.978
said, well, some woman I don't know named Sally 
Shipman. Both from the same city. No, I was living

23:35.388 --> 23:36.670
in Kansas. Oh, you were in Kansas at that time. I was 
in Kansas, and he didn't know her. And the lawyer

23:40.114 --> 23:42.557
said, that was one of my students. She was on her 
thesis committee.

23:47.763 --> 23:49.865
Well, she won very handily in that. There was a time 
when there was a lot of conflict, and there was a

23:49.946 --> 23:53.710
petition candidate, too. But she won that 
election. So she's quite well known nationally,

23:56.433 --> 23:59.277
too.

24:03.702 --> 24:04.483
Ellen. want to thank you for your time and for your 
very valuable input to this project. I'm sure it

24:09.876 --> 24:14.667
will make it far more richer and more accurate and 
more interesting. All right. Glad to do that.

24:20.962 --> 24:21.223
Thank you.
