WEBVTT

00:46.420 --> 00:46.841
Hello? Yeah,

00:47.582 --> 00:55.692
okay. Okay. Well, can I still ask you about, um...

01:01.960 --> 01:04.383
Okay. The Connecticut... Well, can you tell me 
about... So, that's about... You just wrote

01:06.886 --> 01:09.410
articles when you're underneath? When you're 
underground, rather? Yes. And you... Yeah, what

01:15.547 --> 01:18.411
about the Connecticut conference?

01:21.635 --> 01:24.959
And, well, what kind of effect did that have? Were 
you actually effective?

01:29.565 --> 01:33.270
It seems like it would have been very difficult for 
you to get around. Uh-huh.

01:49.347 --> 02:04.960
Uh-huh.

02:45.153 --> 02:47.857
Uh-huh. So when the climate had changed, that's 
when you decided to come out, right? You felt as

02:55.289 --> 02:56.691
though it was safer? Sorry? OK. What reasons did 
you have for coming out at the time you did? Oh,

03:04.103 --> 03:11.935
well, the first seven had come out having

03:04.103 --> 03:11.935
done their time. Yeah. Yeah.

03:42.035 --> 03:42.295
Yeah.

03:50.780 --> 03:55.045
Would you mind being a little more specific on how 
the climate had changed?

04:07.901 --> 04:11.505
Uh-huh.

04:23.062 --> 04:51.297
So

04:23.062 --> 04:51.297
did you think you'd have a better chance at a trial, 
perhaps?

04:52.947 --> 04:57.732
Did you think you might have a better chance in the 
trial since... The trial? Yeah. Let... When

05:00.555 --> 05:02.057
you... I'm sorry, when you came out, after coming 
out, that perhaps they'd... They wouldn't indict

05:06.122 --> 05:07.143
you? Perhaps they'd... We already were 
sentenced. Okay, well... You mean... That you

05:11.568 --> 05:14.170
could have appealed it? For three years? Yeah. No,

05:15.392 --> 05:21.779
we certainly expected that. Yeah. Because it was 
not before a trial, before a trial. Yeah.

05:32.520 --> 05:39.757
Yeah.

05:39.778 --> 05:39.998
You also...

06:02.557 --> 06:22.688
Well,

06:02.557 --> 06:22.688
what did you write in your book, The Enemy 
Forgotten? You wrote that while you were

06:23.069 --> 06:27.315
underground?

06:30.704 --> 06:56.448
I

06:30.704 --> 06:56.448
turned myself in. I took a letter to the press. 
Yeah. They told me that I would appear fully

06:57.189 --> 06:58.110
square. Yeah. Uh-huh.

07:23.048 --> 07:23.188
Uh-huh.

07:33.428 --> 07:57.130
that

07:33.428 --> 07:57.130
the American

07:33.428 --> 07:57.130
people, by being misled to see the enemy abroad, 
the Soviet Union was forgetting the real enemy.

07:57.150 --> 07:59.993
And of course, the captors, the tremendous 
captains across those who ruled the country, had

07:57.150 --> 07:59.993
the enemy historically, a whole history of 
America

08:19.312 --> 08:25.120
Yeah.

08:25.641 --> 08:27.864
I see. Well, I'd like to talk about Hoover for a 
minute, his counterintelligence programs, his

08:28.064 --> 08:40.481
counterintelligence programs that he 
explicitly gave admission to forgery by

08:28.064 --> 08:40.481
typewriter. That's right. And you think it's 
possibly Aldrich Hiss' The Pumpkin Case, the

08:42.704 --> 08:47.530
letters they found? Well, I

08:47.830 --> 09:00.514
myself have

08:47.830 --> 09:00.514
believed the evidence. Yeah. The first time 
there's any public evidence is when I have my book

09:00.654 --> 09:03.880
from the documents of the FBI itself. Yeah.

09:17.986 --> 09:47.487
Uh-huh.

09:48.074 --> 10:10.439
and

09:48.074 --> 10:10.439
that they could forge typewriters, principle 
typewriters, in a much longer period of time. And

10:10.459 --> 10:12.602
then in this instance, they preferred the use of 
firemen, the first of the name was Fortree and

10:10.459 --> 10:12.602
Hadley. And that was the first evidence that had 
ever been made public that the FBI did know how to

10:12.622 --> 10:14.824
forge typewriters. that

10:15.749 --> 10:28.509
that was in

10:15.749 --> 10:28.509
charge of his case. Now, in history, there was a 
court in Antwerp that said, I have been framed by

10:28.529 --> 10:30.352
typewriters. Yeah. Because they claimed that 
certain documents were written on this

10:30.492 --> 10:32.015
typewriter. Goodness. Do you know other people 
that had that done, too, besides William

10:32.936 --> 10:41.830
Albertson that you cite in the book? Well, William 
Albertson was an ex-skeleton in the party.

11:02.155 --> 11:16.437
Aren't

11:02.155 --> 11:16.437
a lot of the pages that you have, of the 20,000 or so 
pages, blackened?

11:29.257 --> 11:29.597
Uh-huh. The

11:29.965 --> 11:39.916
only

11:29.965 --> 11:39.916
things I could get were black pages, not a single 
word. Goodness. And I had made trips abroad. I know

11:40.717 --> 11:41.918
they'd go through a lot and all that, but not a word. 
And they only gave... And when the FBI, the pages

11:41.938 --> 11:55.493
you have from the FBI are only of your exploits, 
correct?

11:55.513 --> 11:55.773
That's right. It doesn't deal with the others who 
were on the ground. Those are my own files. Wow. So

11:58.619 --> 12:02.970
have the others gotten theirs, or have they? No,

12:04.214 --> 12:13.217
I think I'm the only one. I want to thank the young 
lawyers. Uh-huh.

12:35.963 --> 13:02.889
Good.

13:02.909 --> 13:03.029
I see. I see. Well, can I ask you about Leavenworth? 
You seem, from your book, it's as though you were

13:06.929 --> 13:14.337
treated worse than some criminals because you 
were a communist. Correct?

13:18.041 --> 13:20.003
Some criminals, yes.

13:26.570 --> 13:30.294
Well,

13:26.570 --> 13:30.294
of course. There wasn't any personal animosity. I 
think it was part of the climate. They were very

13:31.776 --> 13:32.236
fearful. Somebody, some man in prison said, come

13:33.541 --> 13:53.827
right

13:33.541 --> 13:53.827
to his

13:33.541 --> 13:53.827
congressman and say, well, look,

13:33.541 --> 13:53.827
how is this commie getting along so well? Why do you 
think he has a hefty job in prison and so forth? And

13:55.930 --> 13:57.913
that this would create a furor which would affect 
his leadership. The furor was better than the

13:57.933 --> 13:59.915
soft-eye communism. And so they decided to be out 
there. They were not knowing the other soft-eye

14:00.756 --> 14:01.818
communism. They were going to be hired on the top of 
this. And that's what they're trying to do. So

14:05.936 --> 14:16.803
they're just protecting the wardens, and we're 
just trying to protect themselves, then?

14:16.823 --> 14:18.668
Yes, at one point, there was a word coming in that 
they had been cited by one of the judges.

14:44.635 --> 15:04.395
And

14:44.635 --> 15:04.395
even your

14:44.635 --> 15:04.395
relationship with your lawyer was, your 
supposedly confidential was not, was invaded,

14:44.635 --> 15:04.395
right? Violated?

15:09.921 --> 15:11.402
My lawyer would come twice a year down there to 
discuss with me, possibly.

15:16.799 --> 15:32.718
Confidential.

15:32.738 --> 15:32.918
Goodness.

15:47.815 --> 15:56.026
Well,

15:47.815 --> 15:56.026
was John Winston, he was in... Henry Winston. 
Henry, I'm sorry. Yes, Henry Winston. He was in

15:57.829 --> 15:59.811
dire need of medical care. He had a brain tumor, 
correct?

16:12.569 --> 16:12.709
Uh-huh.

16:28.248 --> 16:51.412
Uh

16:28.248 --> 16:51.412
huh. Uh huh.

17:09.035 --> 17:38.612
Uh-huh.

17:38.632 --> 17:38.772
Uh-huh.

18:02.815 --> 18:25.490
Uh

18:02.815 --> 18:25.490
huh. Uh huh.

18:51.382 --> 19:07.560
Well, why do you think they...

18:51.382 --> 19:07.560
Why do you think they were so negligent? Or do you 
think it was to appear not soft on communism? Or it

19:11.645 --> 19:15.910
could have happened to... Do you think it was 
because it was Henry Winston? Or could it have

19:16.170 --> 19:18.553
happened to any prisoner? I

19:19.225 --> 19:39.310
would say it could have happened to others

19:19.225 --> 19:39.310
as well. I see. Okay. Although one would have to be 
in the mind of putting a position or examining

19:39.590 --> 19:41.873
whether he was right or he was wrong. Yeah. It's 
going to have to happen. It's going to have to

19:42.614 --> 19:43.836
happen. It's going to have to happen. It's going to 
have to happen. It's going to have to happen. Now,

19:46.192 --> 20:09.479
of course,

19:46.192 --> 20:09.479
I had

19:46.192 --> 20:09.479
a big, you know, level of country where the 
carpenter shop, I had actually, and I did my

19:46.192 --> 20:09.479
kneecap. Yeah. And there I had a doctor and a 
patella kneecaps put together and sutured

20:09.619 --> 20:11.261
together. And I had a Dr. Hyde. Mm-hmm.

20:16.972 --> 20:42.523
Uh-huh.

20:51.818 --> 20:52.879
Uh-huh. Well, getting back to your confidential 
conversations with Mr. App, you said something

20:52.899 --> 21:07.734
about that there were, that they created, they 
fabricated conversations they assumed you had

20:52.899 --> 21:07.734
made? Well,

21:07.774 --> 21:19.686
yes. In one case, they had John App, according to 
the document, telling me about... I'd

21:21.839 --> 21:37.741
say that the party organizations come to town and 
get at this point exactly where it is, and the

21:21.839 --> 21:37.741
mentioning names of people who were involved, who 
were doing vocates, and so on. It's all a fabric

21:37.761 --> 21:38.241
thing. I never knew the people that were mentioned 
there, and I never knew anything about the

21:38.261 --> 21:40.945
communist organization in that particular town. 
I

21:41.330 --> 22:10.129
believe part of that is that we think back of the 
whole system of the FBI, including their

21:41.330 --> 22:10.129
organization, that Greta was listening in on 
this, learning the fabric of the stories in order

21:41.330 --> 22:10.129
to make it clear that he was really out of his job and 
that something sinister was really happening.

22:10.149 --> 22:10.830
And also, I don't exclude the fact Possibly

22:11.367 --> 22:38.653
they were trying to get some, create some 
artificial and to ditch on that in case they wanted

22:11.367 --> 22:38.653
to . Yeah. . I see. . Yeah. And

22:39.818 --> 23:08.863
Mr.

22:39.818 --> 23:08.863
Winston, it took until 61 under an order of 
clemency from JFK for him to be released?

23:25.374 --> 23:25.695
Yeah. Yeah.

23:41.159 --> 23:59.798
Which

23:41.159 --> 23:59.798
they tried to prevent you from working in to begin. 
So you were in contact with Gus for a while, Gus

23:59.838 --> 24:05.884
Hall, in Leavenworth? Oh,

24:06.522 --> 24:14.594
yes. When I came to Leavenworth as well,

24:14.614 --> 24:21.003
and a little bit, as I said, he was picked up three 
months after. Yeah. And he still had about a year to

24:21.143 --> 24:22.004
go. So were you allowed to collaborate on papers 
or? Oh, no, no, no. Nothing? I was very strict. We

24:31.337 --> 24:32.479
were ordered very strictly that I could write 
nothing. Uh-huh.

25:07.441 --> 25:34.090
I

25:07.441 --> 25:34.090
see.

25:39.402 --> 25:41.207
So did you talk about the party? Well,

25:41.347 --> 25:48.186
obviously. We talked about what we could gather. 
Uh-huh.

26:12.359 --> 26:29.016
I

26:12.359 --> 26:29.016
see.

26:29.497 --> 26:42.130
And also, when you were leaving the prison, when 
you were getting out, the FBI wanted to avoid

26:29.497 --> 26:42.130
publicity about that, so they shipped you in 
secret to New York Well, what happened there was

26:43.797 --> 26:51.141
when Kess Hall was released, he was released 
directly.

27:30.068 --> 27:51.351
Uh-huh.

28:27.072 --> 28:33.298
Yeah.

28:41.525 --> 28:41.825
Yes.

28:47.851 --> 28:48.131
Yeah. Afraid of too many sympathizers. Well, what 
have you been doing since then? Yeah. I

28:57.177 --> 29:22.155
see.

29:31.872 --> 29:52.595
Can

29:31.872 --> 29:52.595
you hold on one minute? I'm going to change it. I'm 
going to change the tape again.

30:00.880 --> 30:01.604
Yeah, I'm sorry. Just give me a couple more 
minutes, I promise you. I'm closing down. Hold on.
