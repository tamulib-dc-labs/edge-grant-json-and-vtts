WEBVTT

00:03.136 --> 00:12.026
And so since his daddy had the car a lot and he had the 
car, we decided to room together and that was okay

00:03.136 --> 00:12.026
with Wally and he found another room. Describe 
what that room, how was it furnished? What

00:15.470 --> 00:18.193
luxuries did y'all have in that room? We had a 
double-decker army cot-type bed with cotton

00:19.355 --> 00:30.047
mattresses about six inches thick. We had two oak 
desks. Two oak chairs, a wash basin, a towel rack, a

00:33.342 --> 00:44.176
closet. The room itself was,

00:45.878 --> 00:52.707
I'd say, 10 by 12. Now, by what method did you all 
decide who slept on the top and who on the bottom?

01:01.518 --> 01:02.860
I don't remember that. I slept on the bottom, but I 
don't remember how we decided that's the way it was

01:04.358 --> 01:08.564
going to work. It could have been that Walter knew 
that if he ever got drowned out, the guy on the

01:09.546 --> 01:25.791
bottom bunk had better get up and turn his mattress 
over very quickly, or he was going to be sleeping on

01:09.546 --> 01:25.791
a soggy mattress. Now, I would not accuse Walter of 
that. But he volunteered to take the top bunk. And I

01:32.863 --> 01:36.988
will go no further than that.

01:38.029 --> 01:49.582
And how long was it before you ran into any of the 
traditions of the questions and the whipping out

01:38.029 --> 01:49.582
and all that? Right away. You all had been oriented 
on that out at the air base? Out at the air base. OK.

01:58.038 --> 02:00.102
We went through practice drills on that. And when 
we got back to Hart Hall and some of the

02:01.384 --> 02:13.666
upperclassmen came in early, they would try to see 
how effectively we had been taught, I'll put it

02:01.384 --> 02:13.666
that way. So that all the Aggie sports were 
represented in Hart Hall. Every sport. Who were,

02:21.865 --> 02:30.252
for you as a fish, who were some of the celebrity 
famous Aggie athletes here in the fall of 48? You

02:32.735 --> 02:35.657
mean in my class or just in Hart Hall? No, in Hart 
Hall. Well. The juniors, seniors. There was Bob

02:39.020 --> 02:44.785
Smith, Rapid Robert, All-American fullback. He 
wasn't All-American at that time, but I knew Bob

02:45.205 --> 02:50.370
from playing football and running track against 
him when he was at Lamar High School in Houston. Now

02:56.416 --> 02:57.698
he was a year or two ahead of you? He was one year 
ahead of me. One.

03:04.247 --> 03:08.853
We were kind of spare on standout athletes at that 
time. Yeah, that was kind of a down time, wasn't it?

03:11.076 --> 03:17.405
It was, because in the fall of 48 in football, for 
example, we went 0-9-1. And Homer Norton was the?

03:20.894 --> 03:25.661
Homer Norton had been let go the year before. Harry 
Steitler was the football coach. Typist, that's

03:29.726 --> 03:32.951
S-T-I-T-E-L-E-R. Correct. And did Colonel Andy 
come over to your room much in those early days?

03:43.465 --> 03:48.893
Colonel Andy would pass through about every other 
day just to see if Everybody was getting settled in

03:49.328 --> 03:53.614
and you know how things were going. Colonel Andy 
let you do your own thing. He was available for

03:58.040 --> 04:00.824
guidance if you wanted it. He was a father figure to 
every one of us.

04:07.653 --> 04:09.436
Now you were in an outfit. What outfit was it? Core 
outfit was it? It was the 7th Regiment which was a

04:12.760 --> 04:18.508
composite regiment which consisted of the day 
students from Bryan and College Station, as well

04:19.113 --> 04:26.382
as the athletes. Now you said regiment, not 
company. Regiment. Regiment. Seventh regiment.

04:31.970 --> 04:32.871
Composite regiment. Now we, in Hart Hall, we had 
two companies. We had A Athletics, which, and they

04:36.355 --> 04:41.041
divided it. That consisted of football players 
and basketball players. And B Company Athletics

04:48.712 --> 04:51.575
was everybody else. Did y'all have a nickname, 
your company? No, no, just the athletes, that's

04:54.337 --> 04:59.982
what they called us. All right, describe what it 
was like to, let's see, how did you register

05:00.162 --> 05:05.968
academically?

05:09.831 --> 05:10.772
Did y'all stand up? We registered out at Bryan 
Field. Okay, you went through the lines and all? As

05:14.736 --> 05:16.137
part of the... freshman orientation process. 
Right. Describe going to your first classes. What

05:22.745 --> 05:24.629
was your impression the first few days?

05:30.680 --> 05:35.729
It was, we knew by that time where our buildings 
were. The upperclassmen had seen to that. And they

05:39.182 --> 05:46.212
were helping us out as well, so that we wouldn't 
wander around in on a gall, all that kind of

05:39.182 --> 05:46.212
business. And our classes were nearby. The 
farthest classes we had were down by the old water

05:51.679 --> 05:59.470
tower.

06:03.335 --> 06:03.876
In fact, The new water tower is there to this day, 
just a different type of water tower. And down

06:09.585 --> 06:27.461
behind that water tower there were a lot of old 
World War II barracks that they had pulled out of

06:09.585 --> 06:27.461
Bryan Field and had brought out there to the 
college and rehab and cut up into classrooms. And a

06:27.481 --> 06:30.083
number of our classrooms were down there. But we 
had history in the academic building. We had math

06:33.893 --> 06:40.966
and economics in Pfeiffer Hall along with the 
bats. The place was full of bats. Pfeiffer Hall had

06:43.851 --> 06:48.038
fireplaces and chimneys in it. Fireplaces were 
boarded up, but if you'd be on the blackboards you

06:48.660 --> 06:55.632
could hear the bats in there.

06:57.957 --> 06:59.498
That's where we had our classes. Do you remember 
what your academic load was in number of hours that

06:59.539 --> 07:04.563
first semester? Yes, sir. We carried 19 hours. And 
you were at that point an engineering major? No, I

07:10.189 --> 07:11.350
was business. I changed my mind to business before 
I got here when I saw that I was going to have a pretty

07:11.810 --> 07:27.846
busy schedule with athletics and trying to put the 
time that I felt I should into academics. I was very

07:28.265 --> 07:31.791
academically oriented. Describe going to 
classes the first days and your impression and

07:32.292 --> 07:42.589
what the faculty attempted to do and say.

07:45.454 --> 07:53.968
We had an economics prof, I don't remember his 
name, but the first thing he said was, and he wrote

07:45.454 --> 07:53.968
it on the board, He said, if you can teach a pig to say 
supply and demand, you have an economist. And

08:02.771 --> 08:09.100
would you believe that showed up as a question on 
the first major quiz? And we had Screamin' Al

08:09.120 --> 08:13.987
Nelson for history. Make believe I didn't know 
him. Describe. Screamin' Al Nelson was about as

08:17.572 --> 08:25.744
hard shell a Republican as you could come across. 
An extremely brilliant man. I don't believe there

08:28.392 --> 08:35.240
was a book in Cushing Library that he hadn't read. 
You could never put anything over on him except for

08:35.260 --> 08:40.106
one thing. If you wanted to get out of a boring 
lecture, all you had to do was raise your hand and

08:41.628 --> 08:51.259
say, Dr. Nelson, My dad said that Roosevelt pulled 
us out of the Depression, and he would take off like

08:51.897 --> 08:59.987
a skyrocket. Now, he would yell about that more 
than anything else, wouldn't he? Oh, absolutely.

09:04.032 --> 09:05.714
He would get up on his desk. He would kick the books 
and the inkwell and everything else off his desk.

09:11.422 --> 09:18.090
He would start marching back and forth on that 
desktop, stomping and shouting, and the Other

09:18.914 --> 09:31.072
people, other professors who had classes would 
very nicely come and shut his door so they wouldn't

09:18.914 --> 09:31.072
have to listen to him echo up and down the halls of 
the academic building. That was the funniest

09:32.895 --> 09:37.682
thing I ever ran into in my life from a prof. But in 
fact, he was an effective teacher. Oh, he was. I

09:42.850 --> 09:44.752
mean, you learn history. You learned it. pretty 
much on your own. What he taught you was ancillary

09:48.374 --> 09:51.899
stuff. You got your test questions out of the 
textbook. And he didn't put up with any goofing

09:56.286 --> 10:00.212
off, did he? No nonsense. Absolutely no nonsense. 
What about some other from that first semester, if

10:02.635 --> 10:06.561
you can remember? We had Dr. Doak for biology. Dr. 
Doak was a brilliant a scientist, a Casper Milk

10:13.370 --> 10:17.554
Toast type of man. But there wasn't anything about 
biology that he didn't know. And he taught us a lot.

10:25.182 --> 10:29.487
He was very quietly effective in his own way. And a 
full three hours of lab every week, I bet. A full

10:32.951 --> 10:34.152
three hours of lab. No frog dissections. We had 
that in high school. And while I'm on that subject,

10:43.542 --> 10:48.106
You had asked me earlier how I felt my high school 
had prepared me. It was very obvious compared to

10:48.126 --> 10:57.474
what some of the other students absorbed or what 
they knew.

11:01.177 --> 11:03.539
We were all required to take Algebra I. Most of them 
had had, not most, but half or so, had had two years

11:05.921 --> 11:12.807
of mathematics. addition, subtraction, 
multiplication. Very few of them had geometry.

11:20.465 --> 11:35.842
I had had two years of algebra, a year of plain 
geometry, a semester of solid geometry, a year of

11:20.465 --> 11:35.842
trig, and chemistry and physics. I took the whole 
nine yards. And I felt real sorry for some of these

11:41.812 --> 11:47.982
young fellows that came out of smaller schools 
that didn't have the opportunity to learn all

11:41.812 --> 11:47.982
those things that I did. What were, for you and your 
new friends that had the same kind of attitude you

11:48.943 --> 12:03.946
have, what were your basic guidelines about going 
to class, class behavior, and so forth? The

12:05.589 --> 12:07.752
guidelines were you're expected to go to class. 
That was all that was said about it. And behavior,

12:13.681 --> 12:21.053
you're a young gentleman, you behave yourself in 
class, and we did. I mean, we were athletes, and

12:21.073 --> 12:35.697
athletes are probably a little more rambunctious 
than the average student, but we were also kind of

12:21.073 --> 12:35.697
no-nonsense guys. I knew what we were there for. 
And I just thought of this. You were also a

12:39.629 --> 12:45.614
comparatively rare commodity to be freshman on 
that campus, weren't you? On the main campus. An

12:48.637 --> 12:53.181
oddity is not done again to describe it. We were 
unique. So there weren't many freshman sections

12:56.264 --> 12:58.466
of anything. We were the freshman section of 
everything. Now, the The curriculum and classes

13:05.140 --> 13:12.928
that I'm describing to you are the classes that the 
business freshmen went to. Now, some of the

13:12.948 --> 13:26.541
engineering freshmen, they would go to our 
English and math and history classes, and then

13:12.948 --> 13:26.541
they'd go to their specialized classes. As

13:27.682 --> 13:34.168
you get worked into this academic routine, Where 
did you and your buddies go when you had a break,

13:34.638 --> 13:40.325
when you had some unscheduled time? The Y. What did 
you do over there? Shoot pool, drink coffee. Were

13:47.213 --> 13:49.215
you a coffee drinker when you got to A&M? Oh, 
hardly. But it didn't take long. I became a veteran

13:57.405 --> 14:00.348
coffee drinker. Had you been a pool shooter before 
you got here? No. My roommate, Walter Evans,

14:04.793 --> 14:07.316
taught me that. He taught me pool. He taught me 
snooker. And there was a snooker parlor up above

14:12.002 --> 14:17.129
Doc Lipson's drugstore at Northgate. Really? At 
the corner of Northgate and College Main,

14:18.350 --> 14:25.439
catty-cornered across from the post office. And 
we would go up there and play the game, the

14:25.699 --> 14:29.244
occasional game of snooker. And then... If you 
wanted to just kind of go somewhere and rest,

14:32.755 --> 14:36.799
relax, where would you go? Go to the library. You 
could go back in the stacks and get lost. I would

14:41.863 --> 14:44.025
have been surprised if that hadn't been your 
answer.

14:46.768 --> 14:49.150
And did you ever go back in there and go to sleep, 
literally? Take a nap? I didn't. I was too curious

14:52.173 --> 14:54.735
as to what they had back there. And I wanted to find 
out about it. And of course, some of the stacks were

14:57.318 --> 14:59.860
restricted. depending upon your classification 
and what you were studying. Now, and the library

15:04.899 --> 15:12.350
was almost a sacred place in terms of no hazing or 
anything like that. Is that right? Absolutely.

15:15.233 --> 15:21.522
There was no, none of that sort of thing went on in 
the library. It just wasn't done. Make believe

15:23.945 --> 15:26.509
that I had not been in Cushing at that era. Describe 
it. As I recall, you went up to the steps into a large

15:30.029 --> 15:55.260
room and around the periphery of the room were 
bookcases of various and sundry different types

15:30.029 --> 15:55.260
of books and then back behind the main desk were 
what we call

15:58.666 --> 16:22.133
of research and then of course there were, I don't 
recall whether there were two or three levels of

15:58.666 --> 16:22.133
stacks up behind the main desk, but that's where 
you did the specialty research and you'd go to the

15:58.666 --> 16:22.133
card index and look up what you wanted to research 
and turn the card in. Somebody would go get the

16:22.693 --> 16:24.235
books for you. Okay, then you went to chow. What 
was... I digress. I remember the ornate light

16:30.892 --> 16:39.020
fixtures in the ceiling in the library.

16:40.201 --> 16:48.549
Back to the, what was the routine like when you and 
your buddies went to the chow hall? Describe a

16:48.569 --> 16:51.712
typical meal and how it was done. We didn't have 
revelry like they did over in the Corps. the Corps

16:55.822 --> 17:04.916
would form in a quadrangle and they would march to 
Belkin Hall for their breakfast meal. Depending

17:05.998 --> 17:14.491
upon when our class was, our first class, we would 
more or less straddle down to Sedesa. When we first

17:16.374 --> 17:22.183
got there, the upper class had the idea, well, we 
will march all the freshmen down there. Well that

17:23.075 --> 17:32.206
lasted for about a week because the upperclassmen 
didn't want to get up and march down there with us

17:23.075 --> 17:32.206
anymore than we wanted to march ourselves. So that 
kind of died on the vine and we found our own way down

17:32.226 --> 17:41.298
there if we felt like going to breakfast. And I was 
always a big breakfast eater and I always went down

17:41.318 --> 17:50.449
there and took my books with me and went from there 
to my first class. But y'all didn't have all that

17:50.699 --> 17:53.844
routine as to who serves it or anything? Well, the 
people who served it were waiters who did not

17:55.326 --> 18:01.515
have... But I mean, you didn't have, as a fish, you 
didn't have to take care of an upperclassman's

18:01.936 --> 18:07.204
plate or anything like that. We had to make sure 
that the upperclassmen were fed first before we

18:07.845 --> 18:13.333
ate. Oh, okay. Okay. And of course, the meals were 
served family style and big bowls and big platters

18:14.712 --> 18:22.522
and that kind of thing. But no, as far as having to 
actually serve the upperclassmen, no. What was

18:28.609 --> 18:31.713
your impression of Aggie food, dining hall food? 
It was, like they said in the cadence,

18:39.164 --> 18:41.646
a freshman privilege is to eat all you can. And I was 
a chow hound. And I thought the chow was great. Now,

18:47.753 --> 18:50.355
the pork chops would get a little greasy. And the 
bull neck was not always the best. It was, shall we

18:54.740 --> 18:57.302
say, chewy. But I thought it was good. And I didn't 
notice anybody ever turning their nose up at

19:01.166 --> 19:06.411
anything that was served. All right, so y'all 
didn't, Did you athletes march either to lunch or

19:09.320 --> 19:14.086
supper? We did not march to a meal after the first 
week.

19:21.756 --> 19:27.183
But y'all did have a table where you were supposed 
to sit each of the three meals. We did. We sat by

19:28.505 --> 19:30.087
outfits. And unless your sport was in season, 
season, then we had what was called a training

19:36.758 --> 19:47.351
table, where you didn't get all that greasy bull 
neck, you got a better quality mainly meat. Who

19:47.932 --> 19:52.077
were the key seniors at your table? Jack Quirey, 
who was the company B commander. Spell his name.

19:56.964 --> 19:58.886
Q-U-I-R-E-Y.

20:00.628 --> 20:04.453
He is a retired school administrator, At East 
Bernard, Texas. He came from around East Bernard.

20:13.123 --> 20:19.050
Ed,

20:13.123 --> 20:19.050
chairman of the board, Bluebell Creamery. Cruz? 
Ed Cruzy. From Brenham? From Brenham. His

20:26.200 --> 20:27.842
brother, Howard Cruzy. was a freshman classmate. 
They were both swimmers. And Herschel Maltz,

20:33.395 --> 20:41.889
M-A-L-T-Z, was a baseball player from Houston.

20:45.676 --> 20:49.402
Houston McCarty, a track man. He was class of 51.

20:55.801 --> 21:09.154
The upperclassmen kind of rotated in and out, but 
pretty generally stayed with their freshmen in

20:55.801 --> 21:09.154
their ramp or in their sport. Did you fish athletes 
attempt any dining hall pranks, jokes, good bull?

21:17.661 --> 21:23.547
No, we didn't attempt any, but we were the focus of a 
lot of them because

21:25.062 --> 21:39.901
We would have to, for example, during football 
season,

21:25.062 --> 21:39.901
if you wanted your kush, which was dessert, if you 
wanted your kush, you had to stand up in your seat

21:25.062 --> 21:39.901
and give kush call. And have you ever heard the kush 
call for Rice Institute? What comes out? No. Oh.

21:49.593 --> 21:52.737
Well, that was another one. That was the brief 
version. The long version was, in a high falsetto

21:54.644 --> 22:08.185
voice, you would say, the loudest possible voice, 
Rudy toot toot, Rudy toot toot, we're the boys from

21:54.644 --> 22:08.185
the Institute. We don't smoke and we don't chew and 
we don't go with girls that do. Our class won the

22:14.074 --> 22:18.260
Bible. And if the upperclassmen were satisfied 
that you gave a satisfactory push call, Fish,

22:23.264 --> 22:25.686
lemmings, saddle, eat your kush. If they didn't 
like it, you'd give it again. Now, did you acquire a

22:28.149 --> 22:30.431
nickname? No, I did not acquire a nickname. 
Because most people did, didn't they? Quite a few

22:36.877 --> 22:39.820
did, but I was just plain old Paul. What about back 
in the dorm that freshman year? Were there some

22:45.626 --> 22:49.169
Good Bull jokes, pranks? Oh, we had Good Bull 
sessions. Yeah, we had a lot of them. One of the more

22:54.095 --> 23:23.224
memorable ones, the

22:54.095 --> 23:23.224
upperclassmen had told us that what you freshmen 
need to do is go out and scout the country and find a

22:54.095 --> 23:23.224
good outdoor crapper so that you can put it up on top 
of the bonfire and you put your names and all that on

22:54.095 --> 23:23.224
it and you'll be recognized.

23:24.217 --> 23:27.861
They didn't tell us what we would be recognized 
for. So a group of us, Billy Bless, me, Don Graves,

23:27.881 --> 23:43.421
Marshall Sorrell, Jody Zurn,

23:27.881 --> 23:43.421
may have been one other. I can't recall right now. 
But we started scouting around out in the

23:45.623 --> 23:52.772
countryside, principally down Wilbur Road 
because Septic tanks were unheard of in those

23:53.090 --> 23:55.432
days. Everybody had an outdoor jar. And we found 
what

23:59.156 --> 24:11.168
we thought would be the ideal crapper and we 
scouted it out and we decided how we were going to

23:59.156 --> 24:11.168
make our approach. There was a road that went 
behind the house about a hundred yards away from

24:12.249 --> 24:18.255
the house. There was a barbed wire fence along the 
road. we were going to lay the fence down, sneak in

24:23.768 --> 24:29.635
at night. We had a couple of tuba sixes, two 
three-pound mauls, a double handful of 20 penny

24:30.276 --> 24:52.982
nails, and we were going to sneak up to that 
outhouse and whack, whack, whack, wrap those tuba

24:30.276 --> 24:52.982
sixes up on that outhouse, put it up on our 
shoulders, and sail out of there back to Marshall

24:30.276 --> 24:52.982
Sorrell's Model A Ford, on which he had built a 
platform extension in the back. We were going to

24:59.704 --> 25:01.505
set that thing up there. And I had a Boy Scout bugle. 
And we were going to go all over the campus blowing

25:04.188 --> 25:13.177
this bugle, letting everybody know that we had 
stolen the perfect outhouse. Well, what they

25:13.197 --> 25:21.045
didn't tell us was that it was the band's privilege 
to put the outhouse on the bonfire. And we had been

25:21.970 --> 25:28.339
set up by the upperclassmen in Hart Hall. And they 
told us, yeah, paint your names on there with shoe

25:28.820 --> 25:31.343
polish. Well,

25:32.805 --> 25:38.373
we got the recognition. And it was from the big bull 
himself, Hayden L. Boatner.

25:45.663 --> 25:47.766
Who would later be famous in Korea. At Chejudo.

25:52.261 --> 25:54.043
No, Koji Island. The prisoner of war. We felt that 
that was a perfect spot for Colonel Boatman. But

25:59.488 --> 26:09.097
anyhow, we had our plan laid out, and in the dark of 
night, we went out to execute it. We took wire

26:10.078 --> 26:19.467
cutters, and we cut the fence, and we laid the fence 
down, and we snuck up about 100 yards through this

26:10.078 --> 26:19.467
pasture. And when we got about 20 yards from the 
house, this joke yard dog comes out from

26:20.037 --> 26:26.846
underneath the house. We had not seen a dog while we 
were out there. Of course, he was always up

26:29.229 --> 26:31.632
underneath the house sleeping. That's why we 
hadn't seen him. And we got up there real quick. We

26:35.958 --> 26:39.302
kicked him away and racked up and put those two to 
sixes on there. Jody Zurn went up to the door to the

26:39.983 --> 26:44.689
outhouse, swung open. The lights came on in the 
house. And we were... just a few steps away from

26:49.433 --> 26:51.636
being intercepted. Jody took two steps forward to 
close the outhouse door. There was a concrete lip

26:57.323 --> 26:59.726
out over the pit. Jody stepped too far onto the 
concrete lip and went ka-chunk down into the pit.

27:09.579 --> 27:11.221
Jody was a little guy anyhow. Oh, that's a price. 
Yeah, and he was standing on his tiptoes just back

27:13.223 --> 27:18.630
there keeping his chin above all the crud and I 
don't remember who reached down in there to pull

27:18.982 --> 27:36.878
him out, but the rest of us started running with 
this outhouse and we figured somebody was helping

27:18.982 --> 27:36.878
Jody and they were on their own. We got back to the 
Model A and put the outhouse on there and here came

27:38.260 --> 27:47.588
the junkyard dog and the guy who lived in the house, 
and he, blam, blam, fired a couple of times, and we

27:47.872 --> 27:55.099
got out of there. He evidently had notified 
Colonel Boatner that a group of students had

27:55.119 --> 28:04.848
stolen this, so Boatner started a campus-wide 
search, and it didn't take him long. Hart Hall was

28:05.348 --> 28:17.119
just the next door down from Ross Hall, which was 
where all the Bulls had their offices, and with our

28:05.348 --> 28:17.119
names on there, it did not take a Philo Vance

28:17.504 --> 28:24.653
to figure out who the culprits were. And we were 
called

28:25.655 --> 28:32.083
on the carpet. And he put his finger in our belly 
button and said, I want a new outhouse back on that

28:32.103 --> 28:41.896
man's property by sundown. I don't care how you do 
it. I just want it out there. Yes, sir. And by

28:49.818 --> 28:53.762
sundown, we had a new outhouse. How did you do it? We 
scrounged lumber. We got the upperclassmen to

28:59.909 --> 29:03.873
loan us some money so we could buy lumber. We felt 
they owed it to us since they'd set us up. And

29:07.877 --> 29:17.768
somebody sketched some plans out very quickly, 
you know, who had an outhouse of their own at their

29:07.877 --> 29:17.768
place out in the country. We just did it. And took it 
back and put it in place. Took it back and put it in

29:22.500 --> 29:23.542
place. Did your buddies tease y'all or anything? 
No, they just kind of snickered. And we said, we're

29:29.512 --> 29:32.577
going to get you guys. We're going to get you. And 
how did y'all get them back? I don't know that we

29:36.945 --> 29:38.668
ever did. Well, one guy we did get back, he was a 
crapperman.

29:47.161 --> 29:57.396
And we knew that he had been one of the instigators 
behind trying to get us to steal the perfect apple.

29:59.539 --> 30:05.348
And we waited until he went in there to take a crap. 
And we snuck around and walked the door on his side,

30:06.690 --> 30:15.042
came back around to my side, We had what was 
referred to in those days as a nigger chaser, which

30:16.743 --> 30:31.881
was a pyrotechnic and you would light it and it 
would go all over the place and then explode. We

30:33.122 --> 30:45.096
figured we gave him enough time to drop his 
britches and sit down and we opened the door and

30:33.122 --> 30:45.096
threw this light chaser in there, locked the door, 
And there he was, spinning around him with his

30:45.464 --> 30:50.951
pants down below his ankles. And we could hear him 
hollering and screaming. And we let him sweat it

30:55.297 --> 31:00.143
out for about 15 minutes, and somebody went back up 
there and unlocked his door. Now, the mention of

31:02.507 --> 31:12.720
the outhouse causes me to ask, what did a fish in 
your year, what did you all do about bonfire?
