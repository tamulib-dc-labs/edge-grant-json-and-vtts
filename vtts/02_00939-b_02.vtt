WEBVTT

00:03.203 --> 00:19.643
Since I probably

00:03.203 --> 00:19.643
didn't answer many of them, which I apologize for, 
I really should know the history of the city

00:03.203 --> 00:19.643
better, but quite often what we wind up with in the 
planning is you're so busy trying to... stay where

00:19.977 --> 00:41.682
you are that you don't have too much time to worry 
about the history and tradition uh galveston

00:19.977 --> 00:41.682
though does have a strong sense of history and i 
don't mean to imply people aren't aware of it the

00:19.977 --> 00:41.682
strand redevelopment uh venturi and rosh did a 
plan for it won a progressive architecture award

00:19.977 --> 00:41.682
while i was there using municipal data the only 
thing they added to the plan was 1975

00:41.662 --> 00:45.930
was the award. They did the work in 74. The only 
thing they added to city data and design work that

00:48.235 --> 00:57.392
had been done to that point was that they came up 
with a color scheme and some sketches of what the

00:48.235 --> 00:57.392
street ought to look like. But the city parking 
analysis, planning analysis, land use,

00:57.777 --> 01:07.627
everything, population, commercial 
opportunities, linkages, it had all been laid out

00:57.777 --> 01:07.627
by the city staff. Which is typical of a lot of 
consultants, you know, and that's okay, it was a

01:08.247 --> 01:11.711
good plan. They just put the spinach on it. You 
know, they put the spinach on it and put it into a

01:12.532 --> 01:18.378
nice package so it looked good and tracked the 
attention. They got their fee. They got their fee

01:19.379 --> 01:21.381
and left town. But, you know, that's alright, we 
need people like that, yes. There's a historic

01:26.549 --> 01:36.608
district that has attracted a great deal of 
interest in the East End that has renovated what

01:26.549 --> 01:36.608
was really a decaying ghetto and slum to that 
point. It became very popular. While I was there,

01:38.411 --> 01:45.925
we established a second historic district called 
Central District that was kind of toward the

01:38.411 --> 01:45.925
seawall west of downtown. Very fine old houses. 
Marvelous. It's one of the greatest collection of

01:48.748 --> 01:55.597
19th century Victorian architecture that you'll 
find. The Strand has got perhaps the greatest

01:55.617 --> 02:04.548
collection of commercial Victorian businesses 
that you'll find. Cast iron storefronts bought to

02:04.568 --> 02:10.295
order from the east coast and bolted onto the 
building. Instant architecture. the best the

02:12.483 --> 02:14.366
world has to offer. At that time. At that time. It 
was far more sophisticated than Houston. Oh,

02:19.794 --> 02:19.974
yeah. And the outcome, of course, was that you have 
a series of mansions in Galveston that even by

02:19.994 --> 02:32.072
today's standards are perhaps some of the 
greatest pieces of architecture that you can

02:19.994 --> 02:32.072
find. And certain foremost examples, Bishop's 
Palace is a marvelous example. Okay.

02:44.097 --> 02:50.327
Let's go through the list here to see if there's 
anything we can pick up. Well, do you know when the

02:50.347 --> 02:55.095
city first established the planning department 
as such? Do you have any ideas? I don't know when it

02:58.808 --> 03:01.431
was established, per se, as such. I would say that 
if they had a planning commission established

03:01.491 --> 03:12.340
under the 61 charter, it would only be logical that 
a planning department to provide staff

03:01.491 --> 03:12.340
assistance to that commission would also have 
existed at that stage. It's kind of an inescapable

03:13.581 --> 03:15.663
conclusion. Now, it may have well been a city 
engineer or a planning inspector that was doing,

03:15.723 --> 03:25.892
or a department or building inspector doing the 
work, but I really don't know beyond that. If they

03:26.193 --> 03:33.322
had a planning staff persuade before that, it 
would have somewhat surprised me. Was there any

03:33.342 --> 03:36.186
relationship with citizen groups? Oh geez. A and 
B, what was the relationship between the planning

03:38.569 --> 03:46.980
department and the city council? There was 
tremendous relationships between citizens

03:50.932 --> 04:03.658
groups, extremely strong special interest 
groups in the community, neighborhood

03:50.932 --> 04:03.658
associations, historic associations, cultural 
societies, Almost any three people that got

04:03.841 --> 04:08.125
together had a common ax to grind. And part of it was 
the frustration of not having a city that was

04:08.485 --> 04:12.369
responsive. You couldn't get the staff to answer a 
question. You know, who put up the bicycle pathway

04:15.271 --> 04:18.014
signs? And half the city staff would refuse to 
answer for fear they would get somebody in

04:18.094 --> 04:22.338
trouble. And it turns out the guy wants to 
compliment the city on establishing a bicycle

04:22.358 --> 04:29.924
pathway, even though it may not be one of the most 
advanced designs. You know, the more, here are

04:30.185 --> 04:33.848
some lines and markings, and let it go with that. In

04:33.828 --> 04:45.399
many ways, the city staff reminisces very much 
about what it was like under the commissioner

04:33.828 --> 04:45.399
system, and you had to watch your step. There was no 
civil service protection. You made a mistake, you

04:47.101 --> 04:54.068
were canned immediately, and everything was 
political, and it was a very corrupt city. It was

04:54.628 --> 05:00.814
wide open gambling, mafioso, and you'd wind up in 
the bay if you weren't careful. And part of all of

05:01.807 --> 05:08.119
this was part of that 61 reform package to try to get 
some of that cleaned up. And some of the mansions

05:08.920 --> 05:13.309
those people lived in are still there, you know, 
the criminal elements. There's still a lot of

05:13.349 --> 05:15.553
gambling and prostitution. I shouldn't say it, 
but I'm absolutely convinced the police

05:15.593 --> 05:24.490
department, many elements of the police 
department was still on the take when I was there.

05:25.330 --> 05:30.877
Corruption in many aspects was pretty darn 
rampant, and it was kind of hard to get that image

05:25.330 --> 05:30.877
snapped out. The citizens absolutely

05:31.498 --> 05:36.905
were adamant. They were active. There was good 
community organization. We tended to support it

05:40.210 --> 05:47.119
because people that were active and citizens 
tended to support the kind of things that we

05:40.210 --> 05:47.119
thought needed to be done, too. And I'll be honest 
with you, a lot of them were just absolute pains in

05:47.740 --> 05:53.295
terms of the planning staff and department. They 
would pick us, you know, okay, you've got to put up

05:53.596 --> 05:57.868
with them for a while. We would put up with them for a 
while. They would call us and report things. We'd

06:02.668 --> 06:13.687
be sitting there trying to ramp up a grant 
application for $500,000, and they're screaming

06:02.668 --> 06:13.687
because somebody's putting up a chain-link fence 
in a historic district without any building

06:02.668 --> 06:13.687
permits. We'd have to drop that and try to get 
somebody out there to respond to it and red-tag it.

06:18.335 --> 06:21.942
and catch the guy that's doing business, you know, 
and so forth. And, you know, it's difficult

06:22.122 --> 06:24.987
working with people. They don't understand all 
the time why you don't respond immediately or to

06:25.047 --> 06:38.672
their satisfaction, particularly when there's a 
conflicting interest, you know, and you're kind

06:25.047 --> 06:38.672
of caught in the middle and there's a judge saying, 
well, we know why you're seeing that, but we don't

06:25.047 --> 06:38.672
have any legal basis or authority to act. So that's 
a problem. The planning staff's relationship

06:41.223 --> 06:45.008
with the city council was interesting. All city 
staffs would be drug into the city council

06:45.849 --> 06:54.101
chamber, particularly directors on occasion. 
And it's a very complex thing in its personality

06:54.121 --> 07:01.372
more than anything else. If the city council had 
respect for the staff and thought they were

07:02.053 --> 07:07.140
competent, They would tend to listen and treat 
them as professionals. They also tended to treat

07:11.740 --> 07:17.386
most of the staff as being incompetent and not 
being professionals. The general feeling was, as

07:17.786 --> 07:27.496
left over from the commission days and the poor 
salaries, was that anybody that worked for

07:17.786 --> 07:27.496
Galveston obviously couldn't be that good. If 
they were any good, they would be gone within a

07:28.016 --> 07:36.925
short time, so there was no real point in doing much 
more than using them to your maximum within the

07:28.016 --> 07:36.925
short term. This is a common problem I think all 
cities have. If you're really going to get it, why

07:41.229 --> 07:43.494
are we working for us? And it permeates all levels 
of government. So that's a real problem. On the

07:51.209 --> 07:57.040
other hand, it's very obvious that they attract 
good attention and got things done and they notice

07:51.209 --> 07:57.040
things. But there was a lot of reasons that they 
should think many of the city staff were

07:57.712 --> 08:02.857
incompetent, because in fact they were. We had a 
city attorney, who I won't name now, who had come

08:04.279 --> 08:12.487
fresh out of law school and gotten a job as the third 
assistant city attorney, junior, bottom of the

08:04.279 --> 08:12.487
line. And he kind of stayed there. Well, of course, 
attorneys traditionally always get paid a little

08:13.628 --> 08:21.035
bit more, and that's the way they make connections 
within a community so they can go set up their own

08:13.628 --> 08:21.035
practice. You know, you win your spurs and win a few 
cases and get a reputation, and you go from there.

08:26.399 --> 08:39.682
Well, the outcome of all of that was that you're 
facing a situation where in most law schools, they

08:26.399 --> 08:39.682
don't teach much about municipal law. They don't 
teach much about planning or land use law. There's

08:41.845 --> 08:42.647
no money in it. You know, why bother? Nobody in his 
right mind is going to do that other than worrying

08:43.669 --> 08:48.036
about the bonds and the financial aspects. Well, 
this guy, because he stayed there for a long period

08:49.096 --> 08:53.580
of time, kept getting promoted. The guy above him 
quits and gets a good job, and he moves up. Well, it

08:59.165 --> 09:15.039
got interesting because it got to the point that I 
was going downstairs, borrowing his law library,

08:59.165 --> 09:15.039
looking things up, and then carrying the open 
volumes into him to talk to him about what we were

08:59.165 --> 09:15.039
getting ready to do and why we could do it.

09:17.321 --> 09:19.002
It also got to the point that He would get put on the 
spot and make some very bad mistakes. There's an

09:23.983 --> 09:27.707
incorporated village on Gallaston Island called 
Jamaica Beach. It is there because he made a wrong

09:27.727 --> 09:34.333
decision on the spot in the city council chamber. 
The mayor, who was a lawyer, said, are you sure you

09:34.353 --> 09:37.777
can do that? And he said, well, yes, I'm convinced 
that if they want to withdraw their application

09:39.198 --> 09:45.124
that the clock would stop. that doesn't 
necessarily hold so. What they were saying is we

09:48.251 --> 10:00.992
would like more time to negotiate, and the clock on 
us incorporating within your extraterritorial

09:48.251 --> 10:00.992
jurisdiction certainly does not stop unless we 
efficiently remove the application. So the

10:01.092 --> 10:07.984
result is Jamaica Beach is the only incorporated 
city on Galveston Island except Galveston. The

10:08.004 --> 10:09.306
lawyer was told by the mayor, are you absolutely 
sure? You take all the time you want, because if

10:12.312 --> 10:21.346
you're wrong, it will be the last decision and 
advice you ever give to this council.

10:22.388 --> 10:23.169
He's no longer there. And it was deemed to be just a 
total disaster from the standpoint of the city.

10:29.879 --> 10:32.183
And from a planning standpoint, it's utterly a 
disaster. It's like creating a 450-unit

10:32.203 --> 10:36.930
subdivision in the middle of downtown Austin. You 
know, with an independent police force on Tylan

10:38.783 --> 10:48.517
Park and University Park all over again, with 
totally incompetent and incapable of putting on a

10:38.783 --> 10:48.517
smaller schedule. Yeah, on a smaller schedule. 
Which makes it less viable. Yeah. And with all the

10:52.803 --> 11:05.061
same physical problems and constraints the city 
of Galveston as a whole had, but without any city

10:52.803 --> 11:05.061
staff or assistance or professional tax base to be 
able to do any work, which meant they tried to wing

10:52.803 --> 11:05.061
everything.

11:08.213 --> 11:13.522
Oh, right.

11:13.602 --> 11:15.906
How is the department itself organized? Is there 
any specific formal organization in the planning

11:16.126 --> 11:21.936
department, would you say? Oh, yeah. Every 
bureaucracy has got to have a formal

11:22.797 --> 11:27.385
organization. At the time I was there, it might 
almost be easier to sketch out

11:36.715 --> 11:40.499
trying to explain it, but essentially. We can do 
that after the interview. Alright.

11:49.669 --> 12:00.481
Have there been any fairs or expositions that you 
remember in or where I'm in Galveston that might

11:49.669 --> 12:00.481
have affected the planning? I'm not sure. Oh, like 
county fairs or trade expositions? or major

12:08.086 --> 12:13.594
conventions or something

12:08.086 --> 12:13.594
like that? Not that I know of, but let me say that 
Galveston historically was a resort city, and

12:13.614 --> 12:31.478
there were probably some things that happened 
prior to 1950 particularly that may have been very

12:13.614 --> 12:31.478
influential not only for Galveston, but the state 
as a whole. Today, the convention center in

12:31.778 --> 12:38.868
Galveston is a very small, inadequate facility, 
simply based upon inadequate land capacity. The

12:39.248 --> 12:41.591
hotel availability is quite limited. I don't 
think you're going to see anything very large

12:41.611 --> 12:52.526
scale there, simply because of the

12:41.611 --> 12:52.526
lack of facility availability. I'm sorry. You're 
going. Several things that I think we ought to

12:56.672 --> 12:59.977
touch on. First of all, This is well before you were 
there, of course, but you might have heard quite a

13:01.546 --> 13:24.447
bit about it, the Houston Ship Channel and the 
impact that had on the development of the island

13:01.546 --> 13:24.447
and also the railroad's impact on

13:01.546 --> 13:24.447
the development of the island. Sure. No problem at 
all. Also, we just mentioned the fact that

13:26.589 --> 13:30.473
conventions were a problem for Galveston because 
of capacity for motel rooms and so forth. I think

13:30.807 --> 13:41.350
I'd like to point out that another problem with 
Galveston in terms of conventions is that there is

13:30.807 --> 13:41.350
no airport servicing that is convenient for... 
Well, there is an airport in Galveston. I know, but

13:41.370 --> 13:44.137
it's not convenient for convention areas. Yeah. I 
don't know what service they have in there now, but

13:45.860 --> 13:50.250
there was a subsidiary of... One of the airlines 
was flying a commuter in, which they're flying to

13:51.648 --> 13:57.836
Havel and Otters, which maybe 10, 11 people. That 
certainly is a problem. Transportation into the

13:59.919 --> 14:03.023
city is a problem. But that's almost an inevitable 
situation. The railroads probably provided the

14:09.331 --> 14:16.440
ideal solution for the automobile in that it made 
it very accessible. and that's one of the reasons

14:16.420 --> 14:21.287
it's such a popular recreational resort center. 
The ship channel to Houston just absolutely

14:21.327 --> 14:41.215
devastated because there's simply no, you know, 
with the inadequate berthing space that was

14:21.327 --> 14:41.215
available in Galveston, the fact that it had just 
been devastated by a major storm, all combined to

14:21.327 --> 14:41.215
really, you know, create the demise of Galveston 
as the premier coastal city. Land was much

14:42.517 --> 14:46.242
cheaper, much more abundantly available all 
along the Ship Channel, Texas City, Port Arthur,

14:46.475 --> 14:51.622
all the way into the Ship Channel itself. I don't 
think there's any doubt or argument about that.

14:55.306 --> 15:06.020
And on the other hand, some people in Galveston 
would argue that was probably the best thing that

14:55.306 --> 15:06.020
ever happened, because otherwise Galveston 
would turn out to have looked like Texas City or the

14:55.306 --> 15:06.020
Houston Ship Channel. And it certainly would have 
not been the more diverse cultured community that

15:07.382 --> 15:14.912
it is today. So, you know, you can look at it as being 
something that was bad that happened from an

15:16.360 --> 15:25.733
economic sense, but on the other sense, it 
probably helped the community. Okay, what about

15:25.973 --> 15:30.419
World Wars? Galveston, in its strategic 
geographic position, had a pretty important role

15:31.120 --> 15:36.968
to play. You may not be familiar with that, but I 
want to bring it up because there are military

15:37.876 --> 15:45.652
bases there yet. During the Second World War, they 
had to fight . Well, they had a coastal artillery

15:48.819 --> 15:57.437
position that was established there probably 
after the Civil War. And so they had coastal

15:57.940 --> 16:03.467
artillery bunkers and Coast Guard usual 
activities like that. At the present time they

16:03.487 --> 16:15.021
have major corps of engineers stationed there and 
they have Coast Guard stationed there probably

16:03.487 --> 16:15.021
equivalent of about two or three cutters and some 
smaller boats.

16:16.743 --> 16:20.488
In terms of its strategic importance it's 
certainly not of the levels say of Norfolk or San

16:22.257 --> 16:40.350
Diego or some of those places because you know it is 
removed it's not on the coast it's not where the

16:22.257 --> 16:40.350
action is but on the other hand certainly there was 
submarine activity in the gulf and Galveston and

16:22.257 --> 16:40.350
the city and The refineries all provided critical 
resources, and from an economic sense and from

16:40.668 --> 16:50.623
basically kind of a submarine patrol sense, it was 
important. But I don't think that it was as

16:50.643 --> 17:01.901
important from a national sense other than from 
the refinery and the materials and economic

16:50.643 --> 17:01.901
standpoint. That's what made it so important.

17:07.600 --> 17:17.697
No, there's none in Galveston, but it was kind of 
the port of entry for the refinery from Texas City

17:07.600 --> 17:17.697
and the ship channel and so forth. Of course, 
that's where a lot of casualties came. There were

17:21.183 --> 17:28.275
people being torpedoed out of the Houston Ship 
Channel and casualties would be picked up and

17:21.183 --> 17:28.275
brought into UTMB, John Seeley, and it's probably 
why some of the Byrne interest and expertise was

17:28.255 --> 17:38.603
developed in the Shriners located at the Byrnes 
Institute there.

17:55.053 --> 18:03.626
I think we've covered most of these questions 
already, the role of outside consultants

17:55.053 --> 18:03.626
and so forth. Could you sum up what you think to be 
the current status of the planning in

18:03.646 --> 18:11.678
Galveston? I would feel very comfortable 
surmising where they are at the present time. And

18:20.652 --> 18:26.224
part of the reason being I've had so little direct 
contact with people there. I would like to say one

18:27.993 --> 18:31.457
thing more about the consultants. Galveston's 
been willing to spend money on consultants, which

18:31.477 --> 18:36.123
I think is a good thing. The city staff there, like 
most communities, has really been too small, and

18:36.323 --> 18:49.359
in many cases it hasn't had expertise in 
particular things that need to be done, but

18:36.323 --> 18:49.359
they're not something you want somebody on staff 
with that expertise to kind of run out of. You know,

18:49.379 --> 18:52.363
you do one building survey, and that's it. You 
know, I mean, basically you've got the... what is

18:55.718 --> 19:02.235
it, HABS, Historic American Building Survey, and 
the THC does everything. So you get those two done,

19:02.255 --> 19:09.373
they mutually identify the community, and you 
don't need to have them back, hopefully, for

19:02.255 --> 19:09.373
another five or 10 years. The same is true in terms 
of engineering expertise, transportation,

19:09.657 --> 19:15.505
traffic analysis. A lot of times the community 
would have not been able to conduct its standard

19:16.105 --> 19:27.560
affairs and standard planning activities and 
made applications for some of these major grants

19:16.105 --> 19:27.560
without having a consultant hired. Whether it's 
Bajar Johnson, Wilbur Smith we had working for us

19:27.681 --> 19:34.129
on the transit plan. Bernard Johnson's done some 
things. Martin Sprengler's done some things. You

19:39.538 --> 19:49.752
know, we've had some firms that, you know, 
occasionally we snicker and laugh about because

19:39.538 --> 19:49.752
you pick up the plan and say, hey, this is just like 
the one Marvin did in Port Arthur and Beaumont. You

19:49.772 --> 19:54.198
know, you see the same colors, the same press tape, 
you know, and the same format. And you can tell

19:54.598 --> 19:59.104
which community spent more because there's more 
to the ones that spent more. But in reality, those

19:59.084 --> 20:04.291
consultants are vital. You cannot adequately do a 
good job without them. And it would be expensive

20:06.574 --> 20:13.584
trying to keep those kind of people, those skills 
on staff year-round. Okay. Let's take a look at

20:15.126 --> 20:23.137
some of these influences on planning process in 
Galveston. You talked about political

20:23.157 --> 20:26.762
influences. What about religion? Has religion 
played any, has it impacted the planning process

20:29.282 --> 20:34.182
at all? If not, we just want to know. I would say yes. 
It's quite a Catholic. It's very heavily

20:39.845 --> 20:41.848
Catholic. There's a large Jewish population. 
It's got an Eastern Orthodox Church. As a matter of

20:48.398 --> 20:51.522
fact, it's a very Catholic community. The 
Catholics have established an extensive

20:51.542 --> 20:57.992
parochial school system in the community. At the 
time, there were something like four Catholic

20:58.032 --> 21:03.260
high schools operating at one point. A lot of them 
have been consolidated and phased down to just

21:03.280 --> 21:06.925
junior high. and so forth. Interestingly enough, 
there's a very large black Catholic population in

21:09.870 --> 21:17.362
Galveston, which you don't find in most 
communities. So it's not so much a matter of trying

21:17.382 --> 21:24.053
to maintain a segregated school system, Religion 
does play a dominant role. There's a lot of

21:26.751 --> 21:28.053
Catholic churches. There's way too many for its 
population size and the number of Catholics. Part

21:33.441 --> 21:35.744
of it was the historical development. You get 
these older cities that develop in a very dense

21:35.764 --> 21:38.909
pattern. People tend to walk or ride a carriage, 
and they don't go 5 and 10 miles to go to church. But

21:44.317 --> 21:49.264
has religion had such impact in planning?

21:52.180 --> 21:59.248
We're talking about religion here by itself, but 
has there been any causal relationship between

21:52.180 --> 21:59.248
the two? I'm not sure what you mean by causal 
relationship. I would say one thing, and that is,

22:01.390 --> 22:13.162
Bob, that what you've got is you have a lot of people 
of certain religious persuasions and categories

22:01.390 --> 22:13.162
that have informal and formal connections. You 
get a city councilman that is Jewish or Methodist

22:13.323 --> 22:22.052
or whatever, he's going to have contacts because 
of that religious association. And that creates a

22:22.032 --> 22:33.026
very kind of sophisticated social web and network 
that makes certain things a little bit more

22:22.032 --> 22:33.026
responsive or less possible than would have been 
otherwise. The only building within the Central

22:34.027 --> 22:47.044
Historic District that was excluded from the 
historic district regulations, that is

22:34.027 --> 22:47.044
exempted, you know, you've got this one lot 
sitting there in the middle of the district, was

22:34.027 --> 22:47.044
the Jewish synagogue. And part of it was because of 
these kinds of connections. So yeah, there is some

22:51.195 --> 22:54.680
causal influence, but it's not that direct. You 
know, it's not something like the Catholics are

22:54.700 --> 23:00.668
out to see a particular form of development or 
pattern occur. As much as it is, it creates a social

23:01.168 --> 23:09.699
framework within which decisions are made and 
special considerations are taken of certain

23:01.168 --> 23:09.699
individuals. Okay, very good. Now, what about 
ethnic impacts on the planning process? Oh,

23:14.906 --> 23:16.508
tremendous. large Spanish population, large 
black population, virtually every country out of

23:16.488 --> 23:22.094
the Mediterranean you can name. It's a coastal 
city, seaport, you've got lots of Portuguese,

23:22.114 --> 23:34.566
Spanish, Italians, Greeks, and these people in 
some cases have become very influential. For

23:34.586 --> 23:40.993
example, dear old George Mitchell, A&M alumni, 
and it's Greek. and he's had a tremendous impact on

23:42.121 --> 23:48.227
Galveston coastal development. He's playing 
with the computer next door.

23:52.971 --> 23:54.693
So, yeah, there's a lot of ethnic input. 
Furthermore, the feds have mandated that

23:54.753 --> 24:01.420
minorities be taken into account and special 
consideration be given to the province. Could you

24:01.520 --> 24:10.288
give us an example of how a particular ethnic group 
has impacted the planning process?

24:16.141 --> 24:24.989
Basically, if you look at, say, the lower income 
groups that would need to be serviced and the way

24:16.141 --> 24:24.989
they're supposed to spend money. You're loud 
today, Wayne.

24:29.614 --> 24:29.934
Yes. And so the outcome is that the way physical 
developments are funded through, say, community

24:30.755 --> 24:45.068
development block grants, the way bus routes are 
laid out, the way decisions are made about which

24:45.537 --> 24:56.053
school to close or not to close or renovate, all 
tend to be considered in terms of their impact on

24:45.537 --> 24:56.053
various ethnic and racial groups. It's a factor 
within the decision and planning process. And if

25:00.179 --> 25:07.750
it is not clearly reflected in terms of the 
outcome, you're endangering a lot of your funding

25:00.179 --> 25:07.750
processes. And that's something that when I was 
there, we were very concerned about. We made

25:12.918 --> 25:14.160
decisions. based upon how things were going to 
look to federal reviewing agencies or to courts if

25:14.630 --> 25:22.959
we got drug into court.

25:22.979 --> 25:23.600
Okay, very good. I think that covers it very well. 
The next impact, of course, is geographic. And

25:30.167 --> 25:38.115
that one could say a lot about, to be honest, this 
geographic impact on the planning process. Well,

25:38.656 --> 25:42.460
let's just start back in 1830-something. If you 
look at the population growth of the city of

25:42.693 --> 25:57.154
Galveston from the state of Texas, Republic of 
Texas, when it was first being founded, people

25:42.693 --> 25:57.154
tended to migrate in from Arkansas and Louisiana 
from the east. The frontier at the time of the

25:57.694 --> 26:01.299
founding of the Republic was Austin. We still had 
Indian massacres occurring right out here at

26:01.319 --> 26:06.246
Barton Springs. 1836, 1840, occasionally have 
Cheyenne War Party penetrate into down below San

26:12.747 --> 26:18.074
Marcos and right into East Texas before they were 
being chased out. So the whole population

26:18.094 --> 26:37.719
movement of the state was essentially

26:18.094 --> 26:37.719
from the east, and this immediately said, okay, 
what is the transportation route that you are

26:18.094 --> 26:37.719
logically going to try to find in terms of bringing 
goods and commodities in? Well, it so happened,

26:38.160 --> 26:42.265
technologically, there was no decent way of 
moving anything except by water, particularly

26:43.139 --> 26:47.944
bulk commodities and cargoes. Man, it was slow and 
hard going to try to have any kind of cart or wagon.

26:53.090 --> 26:54.511
There were no roads. And so immediately you begin 
to look at the coast in terms of potential river

26:54.531 --> 27:00.878
relationships and navigation. Now, it so 
happened the only decent natural harbor in the

27:00.898 --> 27:05.943
state of Texas is Galveston. It is the only one. 
Every other one has got serious swamps. There's a

27:08.646 --> 27:10.328
lot wrong with Galveston. But it's better than 
anything else on this side of New Orleans, going

27:10.595 --> 27:16.181
all the way down through Mexico. There are 
problems with Corpus and Brownsville, which are

27:17.543 --> 27:22.688
the only other two natural decent harbors on the 
coast. Specifically, what are they going to

27:22.708 --> 27:24.150
service? Nothing. And Alveston tended to have 
good river relationships. He could go up the

27:29.255 --> 27:37.144
Trinity, he could go down to the end of the island, 
go up the Brazos, and he'd get all the way to Waco on

27:29.255 --> 27:37.144
occasion. Jerusalem on the Brazos, right. The 
outcome is that Galveston became the natural

27:41.155 --> 27:52.746
economic center of Port City simply because of its 
transportation relationships.

27:54.868 --> 27:59.473
Traditionally, the limit to navigation on the 
Brazos most of the year was Millikan. Y'all

28:00.033 --> 28:01.555
remember Millikan? You heard this story before?

28:05.399 --> 28:06.960
Okay. um and so Galveston became the premier city 
because this is where all the change of

28:07.615 --> 28:30.754
commodities and transportation techniques 
river boats to oceans schooners to and then when

28:07.615 --> 28:30.754
the railroad got built they were building the 
railroad that got as far as Milken they stopped

28:07.615 --> 28:30.754
building it because in 1961 the civil war happened 
they couldn't get any steel for rails well Milken

28:36.961 --> 28:47.474
Anyway, so the outcome was they got as far as 
Milliken, and that's where the change in

28:36.961 --> 28:47.474
transportation again occurred, you know, back 
over to ox carts and wagons. So basically all of the

28:48.735 --> 28:56.665
commerce of the inland area and developed area of 
Texas for years and years came through Galveston.

28:56.685 --> 29:00.910
The railroads tended to reinforce that pattern. 
Water relationships reinforced that pattern,

29:00.930 --> 29:05.415
all because of the natural harbor. Now there was a 
sandbar out there, but still it was the smallest

29:05.952 --> 29:14.382
sandbar that you could find on any of these rivers, 
because this was the largest flow coming in. So the

29:16.325 --> 29:31.744
geographic pattern was, gee, you come around, you 
go to the backside of the island, nice and smooth,

29:16.325 --> 29:31.744
you drive a few piers in, you have the Strand, which 
is in fact a commercial street, and the back of all

29:16.325 --> 29:31.744
those stores are warehouses, and all kinds of 
wonderful things happen economically. That's

29:32.084 --> 29:35.048
the reason Galveston was there, and that's the 
reason it was developed. And when technology

29:35.332 --> 29:56.196
changed that pattern, you know, we got a new ship 
channel, and we became a little bit less rail

29:35.332 --> 29:56.196
dependent, and the population shift kind of moved 
around, Galveston began to lose itself,

29:35.332 --> 29:56.196
particularly because of its rather hazardous 
exposed position to the Gulf in terms of storms.

29:57.157 --> 30:00.681
The natural elevation of Galveston Island is 
about 12 to 14 foot. The 100-year flood elevation

30:00.701 --> 30:03.364
is 12 feet. The island will go completely 
underwater. In response to that, they built the

30:06.942 --> 30:08.968
seawall. The seawall will probably fail someday.

30:14.178 --> 30:37.772
works so far but the way the seawall works is that it 
keeps the waves running through the island

30:14.178 --> 30:37.772
destroying buildings and all the water seeps 
around the seawall and backs in from the bay and

30:14.178 --> 30:37.772
puts all the entire island under water except for 
the top of the seawall well but that way all you have

30:14.178 --> 30:37.772
is wind you don't have the destructive force of the 
waves which is tremendous in terms of energy

30:14.178 --> 30:37.772
levels And all of your buildings tend to be built up 
on pilings, pretty much. Almost every building in

30:42.219 --> 30:55.096
town, you either walk up to get in, or it's built up 
on telephone poles with the hope that the water

30:42.219 --> 30:55.096
gets underneath and damages the garage and the 
car, but at least it doesn't wipe out your

30:42.219 --> 30:55.096
building. Have there been any minimum elevation 
requirements for construction caused by

30:55.116 --> 31:05.110
geographic factors?

31:09.089 --> 31:20.214
The city adopted a 10-foot elevation 
requirement, and I can't remember the exact

31:09.089 --> 31:20.214
history on it now at one point, for residential 
purposes only. This was, I think, a response to the

31:20.234 --> 31:25.326
161 storm.
