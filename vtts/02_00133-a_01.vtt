WEBVTT

00:02.815 --> 00:04.217
This is March 14.

00:05.619 --> 00:16.816
We're over in the blocker building and about to have the good fortune to interview Curtis Lard about his experiences here as a very dedicated member of the faculty.

00:16.916 --> 00:18.198
Curtis, test yours.

00:19.020 --> 00:20.422
Testing one, two, three.

00:21.103 --> 00:22.545
Testing one, two, three.

00:25.799 --> 00:41.355
Curtis, for the sake of someone who will listen to this tape or read the transcription a long number of years from now, introduce this interview with a summary of your experience and background before you came to A&M.

00:41.395 --> 00:42.015
Where'd you grow up?

00:42.055 --> 00:42.736
Where'd you go to school?

00:42.816 --> 00:43.437
That sort of thing.

00:44.037 --> 00:44.378
Okay.

00:44.818 --> 00:50.524
I was born in the state of Alabama and the TVA Lakes came in and developed a lake system.

00:51.044 --> 00:53.727
where they moved the people out of northern Alabama.

00:54.769 --> 00:58.133
Our family moved to Tennessee, just north of there.

00:59.034 --> 01:04.260
And then I was raised on a farm, what we call a low-income farm.

01:04.861 --> 01:10.267
And later my mom told me that, hey, you'll never amount to nothing on this farm.

01:10.307 --> 01:11.148
That's the way she said it.

01:11.549 --> 01:13.291
Said, you got to go make something out of yourself.

01:13.311 --> 01:16.315
So I took off and went to the University of Tennessee.

01:17.056 --> 01:18.778
And I received my baccalaureate degree.

01:18.898 --> 01:19.819
I didn't like school.

01:20.255 --> 01:22.559
but I stayed in school until I got a PhD.

01:23.640 --> 01:44.794
I went on off to, I worked for the Tennessee Valley Authority after my graduation, and then I went to graduate studies at Michigan State and worked there and got my master's and PhD and had a chance to come back to Tennessee Valley Authority, but instead I had a desire to help young people

01:45.280 --> 01:53.852
who came from rural areas to better themselves, so I chose the University route and I went to work at the faculty of the University of Tennessee.

01:54.713 --> 01:56.515
And then I was there.

01:57.176 --> 02:00.601
You have mentioned your special area and your major.

02:00.621 --> 02:06.309
Okay, and my area of specialization when I went to the faculty of Tennessee was agricultural economics.

02:06.409 --> 02:09.313
I had minors in

02:09.867 --> 02:16.556
economics and also mathematics, particularly mathematical statistics.

02:16.576 --> 02:35.740
And then I had a special area of philosophy which dealt with philosophic value theory and ethics because I felt like, again, that was the basis of a lot of our economic studies and everything we have may have dollars but it also has a lot of human value associated with it so I needed to understand that.

02:35.720 --> 02:48.163
So then I went back on the faculty at the University of Tennessee, and I stayed there about four years in the summer, and then I started looking around, and Texas A&M sent me a letter, said, hey, why don't you come down and look at us?

02:48.824 --> 02:53.392
And so I came down and looked at Texas A&M, and of course it was a different place.

02:53.433 --> 02:54.775
The trees were short.

02:55.312 --> 02:56.754
There were no real forests here.

02:57.235 --> 03:03.945
I couldn't find any women on the campus and so I interviewed and I thought they were nice people.

03:05.107 --> 03:16.103
One of the little strange things that happened, the board of directors at that time rather than the board of regents had met and they had fired the dean of the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences.

03:16.524 --> 03:17.566
That was Dr. R.E.

03:17.606 --> 03:22.433
Patterson and so it was still on my itinerary that I was supposed to visit with him

03:23.020 --> 03:27.106
But in my interview, they substituted H.O.

03:27.146 --> 03:32.274
Conkle, who at that time was one of the administrators in an experiment station.

03:32.735 --> 03:38.564
And I asked Dean Conkle at that time, do you think you'll have anything to do with the future of this college?

03:39.485 --> 03:41.388
And he said, I just might have.

03:41.729 --> 03:49.821
And of course, sometime later, President Rudder named him as dean of the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences.

03:50.459 --> 03:51.721
Then I went back home.

03:52.162 --> 03:54.065
At that time, the Astrodome had just come in.

03:54.586 --> 03:55.909
It was a new thing.

03:55.929 --> 03:57.512
And so I got to see the Astrodome.

03:57.592 --> 04:03.723
And then while I was here visiting, I went back to Knoxville on the campus there.

04:03.783 --> 04:08.451
And I decided with my wife that we would not be coming to Texas A&M.

04:08.920 --> 04:13.848
They made me an offer, and I still said that I didn't think I'd be coming to Texas A&M.

04:14.128 --> 04:15.330
It was quite a shock to me.

04:16.172 --> 04:19.798
And so then they said, well, would you reconsider?

04:20.278 --> 04:24.445
Why don't you write out what it would take to get you to come to Texas A&M?

04:24.465 --> 04:27.871
So I did, and they said, well, come on and join us.

04:28.632 --> 04:30.675
So I had to either put up or shut up.

04:31.111 --> 04:34.495
That's how I ended up at Texas A&M and it's a great place.

04:34.555 --> 04:41.784
I've been here since 1967 and I worked for the first four years in the department.

04:41.844 --> 04:44.547
Well actually it was three years in the department.

04:45.528 --> 04:55.600
I started in 67 and in 1970 Dr. Conkle and Dr. Potts found out how I worked with students and they

04:55.580 --> 05:00.066
asked me to come over to the dean's office and work with students.

05:01.207 --> 05:11.700
They wanted to make A&M, College of Agricultural and Life Sciences, one of the greatest institutions in the world, the largest enrollment, and have great significance.

05:12.461 --> 05:23.595
And so they let me work with students and with faculty and with programs, and we worked with the high schools throughout the state of Texas, worked through the great extension service,

05:23.575 --> 05:28.882
and got nominations for outstanding top 10% of students all over the state.

05:29.483 --> 05:36.873
And we contacted them with letter and our agents and we just had students just fogging in here to come to A&M.

05:37.634 --> 05:44.022
And even though before I went over there, Texas Tech had more students enrolled in agriculture than we did.

05:44.062 --> 05:49.870
And after being there about six years, five years I guess it was,

05:50.356 --> 05:55.789
We had come to the point where we recognized as the largest agriculture college in the United States.

05:56.390 --> 06:04.028
We'd come from less than 1,600 undergraduates to about almost 4,200 undergraduates and the graduates

06:04.362 --> 06:09.768
from about 400 to about 1,400, so we were up around 5,600 total students.

06:10.149 --> 06:11.570
All right, let's go back to the... Okay.

06:13.252 --> 06:17.717
You said when you first visited that first time... Yes.

06:17.738 --> 06:21.682
...that your impression was not as positive as it might have been.

06:22.583 --> 06:28.250
Describe what were the disappointments or... Well, the shocks.

06:28.450 --> 06:30.252
The shocks.

06:30.232 --> 06:38.827
At that time it had been a little over 10,000 students in the previous year and that fall they were expecting something like 11,000 or so.

06:40.009 --> 06:47.903
There were essentially no women on campus and I kept asking the question, why were there not women?

06:48.220 --> 06:59.345
And they said, well, they are permitted now under circumstances where they're either a spouse or either a son or a daughter of a faculty member.

06:59.987 --> 07:06.702
They could also come if it's the only place that offered a degree which they needed, which would be like veterinary medicine.

07:07.323 --> 07:25.294
And also we had to go through a very rigorous, and you may have done this too, all these, the McCarthyism was really everywhere then, and you had to sign all these affidavits about what you had done, and it was a little, and what you were a part of, and it was a little bit strange and regimented.

07:26.156 --> 07:30.343
As you probably know, the college operated then much like

07:30.847 --> 07:37.365
Well, when I say college, I mean the university, because it was really moving through that phase of changing from a college to a university.

07:37.385 --> 07:39.070
It operated much like a military.

07:39.311 --> 07:45.227
You had your general, and you had your captains, and you had your first sergeants.

07:45.697 --> 07:50.745
And the action took place right at the department level, and those are the guys that really made things happen.

07:51.666 --> 07:58.877
Now, as you were here for a few days for an interview visit, the department head in those days was whom?

07:59.378 --> 08:00.720
Dr. Ty Tim.

08:00.740 --> 08:01.501
Describe him.

08:01.741 --> 08:02.082
Okay.

08:02.643 --> 08:04.245
Ty Tim was a great gentleman.

08:04.285 --> 08:05.207
Everybody liked him.

08:05.247 --> 08:07.891
Everywhere over the state of Texas, they knew Ty Tim.

08:08.372 --> 08:11.316
He's a flat-headed Dutchman from Hollettsville, Texas.

08:11.583 --> 08:35.464
and he was proud of it and he was proud to be an Aggie and he went off to Harvard and got his doctor of public administration and he really sold A&M and he had a lot of influence on students to get to go to Harvard and to go do the best they could just like John Hagler who now is you know the foundation building over here he's working with that and he helped

08:36.068 --> 08:37.390
make donations to that.

08:37.650 --> 08:42.236
But he's one of our graduates, and Dr. Tim had a lot of influence on what he chose to do.

08:42.577 --> 08:44.599
And Foraker, you remember, went off to Harvard.

08:44.619 --> 08:45.440
Larry Foraker.

08:46.121 --> 08:47.223
He was a great guy, too.

08:47.383 --> 08:48.905
And Dr. Tim knew him well.

08:50.187 --> 08:55.334
But Dr. Tim was the kind of person you walked in his office and you visited with him.

08:55.354 --> 08:57.937
He wanted you to know that he cared who you were.

08:58.438 --> 09:00.040
He knew Lyndon Johnson.

09:00.080 --> 09:00.861
He knew...

09:01.128 --> 09:04.211
all the Texas politicians all the way to Washington.

09:04.772 --> 09:17.024
And whenever something would happen to you, like you get a promotion or something good happened, he would always write you a note, a real sweet acknowledgement that he recognized that you're getting ahead.

09:17.464 --> 09:22.789
So he pushed you ahead, and he wanted you to, he called them his fair-haired boys, you know.

09:22.809 --> 09:28.755
Well, today it'd be, I don't know what word he'd use to describe women, but anyway, he would have still been generous, I'm sure, towards them too.

09:29.225 --> 09:31.788
Did you talk to Kunkel?

09:31.868 --> 09:33.750
Did you talk to anyone higher than?

09:34.211 --> 09:37.735
Well, at that time, you would get to meet the president, you know.

09:37.755 --> 09:38.096
Did you?

09:38.276 --> 09:38.917
General Rutter.

09:39.057 --> 09:39.738
Did you meet him?

09:40.278 --> 09:40.378
Yeah.

09:40.398 --> 09:41.460
What was your impression of him?

09:41.480 --> 09:46.926
Oh, well, I'll never forget one of the comments he made as he talked to all of us, you know, the new faculty.

09:46.946 --> 09:49.770
And he made these same comments from time to time.

09:50.170 --> 09:58.320
He said, Texas A&M is not great because it has all these facilities, physical facilities, and all these facilities.

09:59.110 --> 10:00.954
all these outstanding faculty.

10:01.495 --> 10:11.594
Texas A&M greatness will be measured by what happens to the young people who come here or the individual who come here to get a higher education.

10:12.035 --> 10:13.137
And a measure of our

10:13.640 --> 10:16.643
our goodness will be what happens to those people that we deal with.

10:17.143 --> 10:30.394
And you know, I was able to share that in initiation of our honor society, this Phi to Sigma that I'm chapter advisor for and have been since probably 1972 or so.

10:31.035 --> 10:36.159
But his grandson was in the audience and I got to tell that story.

10:36.619 --> 10:43.225
And his widow, Margaret, was there and she heard it and she just thought it was so neat because

10:44.065 --> 10:48.912
I told it as if he was speaking to the faculty and reiterated that story.

10:49.373 --> 10:52.117
And I could tell it really went home to them when I said that.

10:52.798 --> 10:54.942
But it made a lasting impression on me.

10:55.322 --> 11:03.394
And I still think today the good that A&M does is what it does with the people that come here to get a higher education.

11:03.414 --> 11:09.043
Now, during that first visit, you said that your first impression was not completely favorable.

11:09.817 --> 11:11.319
What was missing here?

11:12.581 --> 11:18.489
Well, at the time they were going through this, I think some bad things were going on.

11:18.509 --> 11:30.945
There was a lawsuit against the university over AAUP, American Association of University Professors, and over some issues that came up at the time.

11:31.005 --> 11:32.107
They put them on censure.

11:32.848 --> 11:39.216
And on other campuses, this organization had been looked upon as a positive issue.

11:39.938 --> 11:43.127
contribution to the administration of universities.

11:43.789 --> 11:46.216
And yet here they had run into a conflict.

11:47.019 --> 11:51.552
And then, but there were some good things here too.

11:51.835 --> 11:58.506
We had some outstanding people in the department like Dr. Tim and Dr. Pat Wooten and John McNeely.

11:59.067 --> 12:00.289
They were some real good people.

12:00.389 --> 12:04.456
And Bob Cherry, you probably know later, he was secretary of the board.

12:05.157 --> 12:07.361
He was one of the faculty members.

12:07.862 --> 12:12.730
So they had a real fine faculty and had an opportunity

12:12.710 --> 12:14.073
to help young people.

12:14.093 --> 12:17.119
They were a very small department though, you know, only a couple hundred students or so.

12:17.459 --> 12:22.810
Describe where the department was located and the facilities that it enjoyed.

12:22.990 --> 12:23.852
Okay.

12:23.872 --> 12:28.761
We were, at the time, it was located in an agriculture building, which is right by the library.

12:29.146 --> 12:31.629
The library was being expanded at that time.

12:31.669 --> 12:34.512
They were adding the Sterling Evans addition.

12:35.173 --> 12:38.456
And it was right in the center of the campus.

12:38.496 --> 12:39.918
Right across was the pavilion.

12:40.719 --> 12:52.892
And there was an opportunity for the Ag Economics Department once it started growing because it got up to like 860 undergraduates and probably 200 and something, nearly 1,000 students.

12:52.872 --> 12:57.239
by 19 and say 76, 77, somewhere along there.

12:57.299 --> 12:59.222
And they had an opportunity to have a building.

12:59.823 --> 13:06.414
But Dr. Tim, back when he was head of the department, he always said, you ought to be in the center of the campus.

13:06.814 --> 13:12.383
And so that's why they stayed in the agriculture building, along with the poultry science department and rural sociology was there.

13:13.104 --> 13:16.790
And that's where they were located, right there in the center of the campus.

13:16.810 --> 13:19.234
It may not be the center today, but it was then.

13:19.214 --> 13:26.864
All right, when you first arrived, what kind of office facility were you provided?

13:27.885 --> 13:37.577
Okay, I was up on, it was actually the, if you call a ground floor, it had been on the fourth floor, but it was the third floor, and it was room 312.

13:38.238 --> 13:43.645
And anyway, it had been called 412, but they changed it to 312.

13:43.966 --> 13:49.052
Well, my Social Security number starts with 412, so that was real easy that they gave me that.

13:49.454 --> 13:52.561
and I officed with Cal Boykin.

13:53.002 --> 14:04.847
Cal Boykin is now here in the community, and he has written some nice work, and his wife has done one on the Italian families in the Brazos Valley.

14:05.063 --> 14:06.865
He was my office mate.

14:07.246 --> 14:13.954
And we had a nice office, you know, compared, it's probably around, I think it's 11 1⁄2 feet by 12 feet.

14:14.235 --> 14:15.396
It is a pretty nice place.

14:15.436 --> 14:18.540
And he was in one side and I was in the other, so it worked out real good.

14:18.720 --> 14:27.151
Describe the physical move of you and your wife and all that you brought with you from Knoxville.

14:27.171 --> 14:27.812
Knoxville, yeah.

14:28.252 --> 14:30.295
Well, we were moving and...

14:31.726 --> 14:33.908
And we used, we had a moving van.

14:34.008 --> 14:42.277
It probably, at that time, it probably only cost $1,000 to move all the way from Knoxville, which is far in excess of 1,000 miles.

14:43.017 --> 14:44.419
But we traveled by car.

14:45.059 --> 14:52.967
And they kept telling me that, Dr. Tim did, he said, now, we want you to be here on Labor Day.

14:53.868 --> 14:57.492
And I think that's like, may have been the first day of September or something like that.

14:58.052 --> 15:00.855
And I could not believe that anybody

15:01.696 --> 15:05.025
that would be working at a public university on Labor Day.

15:06.208 --> 15:11.122
So I know coming into town that day, I didn't get here until nearly five o'clock.

15:11.142 --> 15:17.038
And I called Dr. Tim and he said, well, you're late to work today.

15:17.018 --> 15:18.540
That's a good idea.

15:18.560 --> 15:20.644
That's a good one.

15:21.044 --> 15:22.306
I'll never forget that, you know.

15:23.007 --> 15:25.892
But he said that, he made a comment about that.

15:25.932 --> 15:35.406
He said, well, Curtis, we didn't hire you for your time, but it's for your expertise and how you represent Texas A&M in your department.

15:35.827 --> 15:39.853
That's what we hired you for, so we don't keep up with you by the clock.

15:39.833 --> 15:46.869
Now describe the community and what you all found as housing accommodation.

15:46.889 --> 15:53.224
Okay, that's a good comment because there wasn't any George Bush Boulevard.

15:53.264 --> 15:57.454
The road played out over here near

15:57.940 --> 16:03.889
back in there where all those dairy streets are and cattle streets like Hereford and all that.

16:04.129 --> 16:07.474
But it played out right there about where, right down from the President's home.

16:07.834 --> 16:09.016
That's the end of it right there.

16:09.457 --> 16:11.119
And it went back in through those little areas.

16:11.580 --> 16:16.888
And then Texas Avenue then was really just a two-lane road.

16:17.368 --> 16:21.234
And when they said Highway 6 runs both ways, that was all of Highway 6.

16:21.274 --> 16:22.716
There wasn't the one around the town.

16:22.756 --> 16:23.357
That was it.

16:23.810 --> 16:26.313
But they started expanding it shortly after that.

16:26.533 --> 16:33.001
And they were debating then whether to add two lanes, additional lanes to each side or one.

16:33.061 --> 16:35.784
Well, they made the mistake of just adding one.

16:35.804 --> 16:38.448
And we've gone through that recently, trying to expand that.

16:39.269 --> 16:42.793
And another thing, though, there were such few people here.

16:42.853 --> 16:45.396
I mean, like 12,000 people.

16:45.781 --> 16:48.485
and a little over 12,000 people in College Station.

16:49.065 --> 16:52.630
And down in Bryan, I mean, you really had to hunt for a place to shop.

16:52.690 --> 17:01.822
I mean, they had Orr's Supermarket for your groceries, and they had a Sears and a Ward's downtown Shire on down there and also near Villa Maria.

17:02.363 --> 17:03.445
And that was about it.

17:03.885 --> 17:08.211
And I remember a comment that the advertisement was,

17:08.765 --> 17:14.090
It said about Sears then, because that was a big, big store, and it said they sell everything.

17:14.691 --> 17:19.355
And my little son, he said, Dad, they don't sell everything.

17:20.196 --> 17:21.517
They don't sell milk.

17:21.818 --> 17:24.200
He was just a little kid at that time.

17:24.600 --> 17:28.424
But we lived over on Francis Street.

17:28.664 --> 17:31.527
We rented a home there on Francis Street.

17:31.747 --> 17:34.350
Do you remember what that first rent was?

17:34.735 --> 17:39.439
Oh, let's see, probably around, I think it was like $400 a month.

17:39.539 --> 17:46.126
It wasn't a lot, you know, compared to, and get a full house, you know, it was a full, I think it was a three or four bedroom house.

17:46.146 --> 17:50.450
It was over there by where James Cooper lived right next door.

17:50.490 --> 17:53.432
That's OC's brother, and they're both medical doctors.

17:53.452 --> 17:56.495
So it was really close, close in.

17:56.976 --> 18:01.840
And I remember the first day that I drove to campus,

18:02.292 --> 18:08.642
when the crisis were started, they had warned us that you probably can't get on campus coming through the east gate.

18:09.404 --> 18:25.791
And lo and behold, when they drove out there to Texas Avenue, the traffic was backed all the way up because they didn't have the flow they have now and people could come through the campus and it was really a mess.

18:25.971 --> 18:29.076
And it did take a long time to get on.

18:29.343 --> 18:34.281
Traffic jams here have never really been real big, you know, maybe 10 minutes at the most.

18:34.301 --> 18:39.078
Now let's see, one of the items we'll insert back earlier, and I won't ask any more money questions.

18:39.138 --> 18:40.483
What was your beginning salary?

18:40.868 --> 18:48.298
Okay, I'm going to round that off to a whole dollar and probably to a whole hundred dollar, but it's about $16,300.

18:48.318 --> 18:56.509
And that was a big salary then because some of the other people had only gotten like $12,000.

18:56.569 --> 19:00.875
But my request when they asked me, well, what would you do?

19:01.696 --> 19:05.562
And of course, I think they probably took advantage of me the next year.

19:05.622 --> 19:07.264
But after that, I was always...

19:07.497 --> 19:11.000
rated in the top group as far as salary increases.

19:11.181 --> 19:12.101
You came at what rank?

19:12.702 --> 19:13.523
Associate Professor.

19:13.543 --> 19:14.183
Associate Professor.

19:14.504 --> 19:18.708
And what, as far as you understood it, what were your duties?

19:18.768 --> 19:21.431
What were you to specialize in?

19:21.491 --> 19:23.152
What courses to teach and so forth?

19:23.172 --> 19:31.120
Okay, at that time, they wanted, my area of specialization was production economics and farm and ranch management.

19:31.600 --> 19:37.386
So I taught the introductory or the farm management class, 325.

19:37.838 --> 19:53.063
I wasn't supposed to teach it that fall, but the professor they had hired, he didn't show up because he was still trying to complete his doctorate, and so they asked me to do it, and then he did come later and joined with me and worked like a graduate TA, you know.

19:53.583 --> 19:55.005
And so that worked out real good.

19:55.025 --> 19:57.408
But I had a lot of fine students in that class.

19:57.508 --> 19:58.369
I still remember them.

19:58.389 --> 20:03.416
Some of them are professors now, and some of them are out in the business world, have done really good.

20:03.657 --> 20:08.924
Like Jimmy Cheek, he is in that class, and he's now the dean of agriculture over at the University of Florida.

20:09.705 --> 20:10.205
Yeah.

20:10.226 --> 20:14.772
And then I had Jim Sanders, who was a professor in animal science.

20:14.792 --> 20:15.793
He was in that class.

20:15.773 --> 20:18.198
I had a lot of good people in that class.

20:18.218 --> 20:19.159
I'll never forget that.

20:19.660 --> 20:23.948
That was my first experience at Texas A&M, and it was a real good one.

20:24.229 --> 20:29.919
Now, they wanted me to teach graduate courses because at that time we were trying to build an outstanding graduate program.

20:29.939 --> 20:34.508
We had about 40 or so students, and they wanted to increase that to more.

20:34.876 --> 21:00.664
make a more prestigious department and so he wanted me to teach the dynamic production economics at the graduate level and the static production economics and I ended up teaching like a lot of other courses like research methodology and then I developed a course in econometrics and at that time the computers were just really getting big and I wrote manuals on how to use the

21:01.167 --> 21:03.950
mathematical programming procedures on the computer.

21:04.511 --> 21:12.661
I'm not as proficient now as I was then in all those things because I knew a little bit more about the languages and how to talk to a computer today.

21:12.982 --> 21:16.546
I know how to turn it on and use it, but not as good as I did then.

21:16.907 --> 21:20.031
But that was a good experience.

21:20.131 --> 21:25.858
I enjoyed that, and those manuals went out all over the world where they used that dynamic programming.

21:25.973 --> 21:29.058
Now, when you arrived, we already had a graduate program.

21:29.098 --> 21:32.443
Was the doctoral program very far along in ag econ?

21:32.924 --> 21:34.146
Yeah, it was established.

21:34.226 --> 21:35.488
It was established at the time.

21:35.928 --> 21:43.520
Now, we hadn't graduated a lot of people, but ones we had graduated were really substantial people.

21:43.600 --> 21:46.625
I know one is Dr. Johnson.

21:46.725 --> 21:49.770
He is head of the extension service for the

21:50.273 --> 21:54.057
State of Iowa now, he's one of our graduates, you know.

21:54.077 --> 21:56.359
We've had several, it came about that time.

21:57.240 --> 22:03.246
Describe, you surely must have had some interesting experiences in some of your early classes with Aggies.

22:03.867 --> 22:10.073
What was it like for a Tennessean born in Alabama to come and start teaching Aggies?

22:10.833 --> 22:16.399
Well, the thing that impressed me so much about them is how disciplined they were.

22:16.818 --> 22:21.824
in terms of their dress and how they had respect for their teachers.

22:24.487 --> 22:32.958
That was just such a clean thing because I'd look out over that audience and probably half of the students or more were cadets.

22:32.978 --> 22:42.049
Now sometimes they would do a little rowdy things on the weekend and maybe not show up on Monday morning class.

22:42.586 --> 22:48.293
And I asked him, well, one day I said, why weren't you in class last Friday?

22:48.653 --> 22:56.883
He said, well, Thursday nights we go out to, I shouldn't tell this on him, but we went out, go out to Lakeview and said, I knew I'd had a little bit too much.

22:57.684 --> 23:02.230
And so I waited until everybody left, and I was the last car to leave.

23:03.131 --> 23:08.637
And said that, and the highway patrol or whoever was looking, they were looking for me.

23:08.777 --> 23:12.542
So they got me, and I spent the night downtown, you know.

23:13.062 --> 23:14.665
But he didn't want anybody to know that.

23:14.765 --> 23:16.688
And I didn't hold it against him.

23:16.748 --> 23:21.176
I said, as long as you won't do that again, it will not affect your grade at all.

23:21.296 --> 23:23.800
And sure enough, he never did that again.

23:24.982 --> 23:30.331
Did you, in those early years, have to learn Aggie lingo and slang?

23:32.214 --> 23:38.445
Well, I would say yes, because I became involved with advising the Corps of Cadets.

23:38.830 --> 23:43.157
And I had such characters as John Sharp, you know, and Rick Perry.

23:43.498 --> 23:45.982
They were my, I remember them as fish.

23:46.763 --> 23:49.848
And John Claytor, they were a bunch of real fine young men.

23:50.369 --> 23:54.376
But I remember John Sharp wondered, will I ever make it at A&M?

23:54.396 --> 23:56.299
I said, oh, you can probably make it at A&M.

23:56.633 --> 23:58.115
And why don't you just shoot for the top?

23:58.135 --> 24:07.651
You know, you can be a deputy corps commander if you don't want to be commander, or you can be head of student government, or you could be student body president, you know.

24:07.671 --> 24:15.604
Well, you know John Sharp did become student body president, and now, who knows, Rick Perry might become governor.

24:15.584 --> 24:22.752
Now do you remember any specific experiences with either of those during their student days?

24:23.454 --> 24:27.028
You mentioned saying some encouraging words to John.

24:28.460 --> 24:32.545
Well, he had this, you knew his little idea about a nickel, don't you?

24:33.106 --> 24:33.947
How that he did that.

24:34.267 --> 24:35.769
That's how he got elected on a nickel.

24:36.330 --> 24:37.311
He'd use that nickel.

24:38.092 --> 24:42.918
I gave him back a nickel one day later when he was, you know, he became a controller.

24:44.400 --> 24:51.970
He's really done well in political circles until he ran for the last one and he got put on the side.

24:52.355 --> 24:53.597
But John's a sharp man.

24:53.677 --> 24:54.538
He'll come back.

24:55.039 --> 24:57.683
Not only is his name Sharp, but he's Sharp.

24:57.703 --> 24:58.685
What about Rick?

24:59.566 --> 25:02.691
Well, I knew Rick, but not as well as I did John.

25:02.731 --> 25:05.115
But Rick's a fine young man.

25:05.175 --> 25:08.059
Now, were either one of them majors in Aggie?

25:08.079 --> 25:08.820
No, no, no.

25:08.981 --> 25:09.562
They were not.

25:11.064 --> 25:13.047
John Sharp was a political science major.

25:13.448 --> 25:16.972
And I believe Rick was probably an animal science major.

25:16.992 --> 25:21.578
Because I had them both in History 105 and I think in the same section, I'm not sure.

25:24.621 --> 25:27.144
But they got spotted quickly by Wayne Stark.

25:27.545 --> 25:28.506
Yeah, oh yeah.

25:28.886 --> 25:38.218
I remember Wayne, he just tried to identify any students that had potential leadership and encourage them to shoot for the sky, you know.

25:38.238 --> 25:39.439
He was that type of guy.

25:39.419 --> 25:51.876
Let's see, in those early days, how did you try to prepare yourself to become better aware of Texas A&M?

25:51.896 --> 25:55.741
How did you, what was your path of learning more about this institution?

25:55.981 --> 25:58.384
Well, I've done this before.

25:58.485 --> 26:03.792
Wherever I go, whenever I go into a community, I want to know the history of that community.

26:04.272 --> 26:06.996
I want to know its values and where it's headed.

26:07.432 --> 26:20.126
and I want to find out this from the best people and the wisest people and the oldest people I can find and then move on forward because I found that just gives you a gold mine of information.

26:20.506 --> 26:36.443
So when I did that here at A&M, I could see if I came in 67, I could talk to people like Charlie Crawford there was born in the 1800s, you know, or Fred Jones, and I could find out things about A&M that people who actually went here didn't know, and I just kept,

26:37.115 --> 26:42.503
picking that up, picking that up, and I have the ability to recall things like that.

26:42.543 --> 27:05.535
It's not necessarily a photographic memory, but it's almost like that, and I enjoyed very much learning from these people, and then I would participate in the Corps, I would read, and then I met faculty that were concerned about these issues, and former students, and then of course I prepared for Aggie Muster and all that,

27:05.954 --> 27:09.946
which indicates the great things about Texas A&M.

27:10.869 --> 27:15.323
I studied being an agricultural and engineering college.

27:16.147 --> 27:20.293
I had a great respect for that, that being my area of expertise.

27:20.714 --> 27:22.617
And I could see the whole world needed us.

27:23.037 --> 27:25.261
So that's one of the reasons I came to Texas A&M.

27:25.321 --> 27:28.566
No state had more of a vast land area.

27:29.046 --> 27:38.020
Now if we think about it, Illinois and California have outstanding agricultural production too, but we have oil and gas and we've got

27:38.000 --> 27:40.685
people and cities and plains and deserts.

27:40.725 --> 27:46.396
We've got agriculture and geography that's almost equivalent to the United States.

27:46.817 --> 27:47.919
And that impressed me.

27:47.979 --> 27:55.333
And I just thought, well, if I'm going to make a move, Texas will be there a long time to come, certainly more than my lifetime.

27:55.313 --> 28:07.065
Do you remember any effort to try to orient and or prepare a newly arrived faculty member when you were a novice here?

28:07.325 --> 28:07.825
Not really.

28:08.246 --> 28:10.268
We just had to do it on our own.

28:10.768 --> 28:22.620
There would be a few things where you could have, you didn't have a mentoring program or anybody like Fish Camp, we didn't have that where the faculty to get indoctrination.

28:22.600 --> 28:26.927
What are the high values here at A&M and history of A&M?

28:26.947 --> 28:27.888
We didn't really have that.

28:29.331 --> 28:36.101
Who were the faculty members in the department that you turned to for advice as a newcomer?

28:36.262 --> 28:38.926
Yeah, well, probably the best guy was Pat Wooten.

28:38.946 --> 28:40.288
He just passed away last year.

28:40.589 --> 28:46.999
And he was the head of the teaching program, both a graduate and undergraduate.

28:47.760 --> 28:50.424
And Dr. McNeely was head of the research.

28:51.285 --> 28:59.417
And they were good people to sit down with and discuss your program, your courses, your research program.

28:59.938 --> 29:04.525
And, of course, Dr. Tim was a good talk with about administrative matters and things like that.

29:05.627 --> 29:07.930
But those were the individuals I turned to.

29:07.910 --> 29:14.068
As far as you were aware, where did A&M's program in ag economics rank nationally?

29:14.429 --> 29:15.593
Not very high at that time.

29:16.074 --> 29:19.725
I don't know what position it would have been, but I do think

29:20.313 --> 29:28.300
by probably around 73 or so, maybe 72, it would be in the top 10.

29:28.480 --> 29:29.681
And I think it still is, you know.

29:29.741 --> 29:33.105
We want a top 10 university.

29:33.305 --> 29:44.215
Well, I feel like that the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, it's on many of these, like Gorman Ratings and things like that, many of their programs are already up there in the top 10.

29:44.455 --> 29:50.320
Do you remember any advice anybody at Tennessee gave you as you came to A&M?

29:50.300 --> 29:55.747
Well, one of the deans up there said, Curtis, we've enjoyed having you here.

29:56.127 --> 30:01.774
And he just figuratively put his arm up and right over the door.

30:01.794 --> 30:03.136
He said, the key is over the door.

30:03.216 --> 30:05.719
So anytime you want to come back, you're welcome.

30:06.560 --> 30:09.003
But while you're there, do a good job.

30:09.744 --> 30:15.391
And they did not at all try to infer that you were going to a lesser place right there?

30:15.712 --> 30:16.052
Oh, no.

30:16.092 --> 30:17.674
No, not at all.

30:17.654 --> 30:33.415
Texas A&M at the time was, as you know, after the Century Report there in 1960 or 61-2 when they did all that study about the more or less what's going to happen to this university as we go ahead and blueprint for it.

30:34.296 --> 30:35.698
It was headed up.

30:36.098 --> 30:36.679
It was headed up.

30:36.739 --> 30:38.081
There's no doubt about it.

30:38.101 --> 30:42.126
It was headed up and, of course, with General Rutter here as our president,

30:42.157 --> 30:59.242
He was making sure that those things went forward, and he knew how to work with people, and he knew how to confront confrontational situations so that he would come out winner, or A&M would come out a winner, and he did good on those things.

30:59.262 --> 31:06.052
All right, as you settled in, how did you go about becoming better acquainted with the state?

31:07.594 --> 31:09.497
Okay, being in agriculture,

31:10.692 --> 31:13.327
We have an extension service and we have research programs.

31:14.996 --> 31:16.163
We've made it a point

31:16.531 --> 31:17.993
to go out into the state.

31:18.674 --> 31:20.917
And you almost make a rule.

31:21.298 --> 31:22.980
You go one way and come back another.

31:23.100 --> 31:25.704
That way you can see twice as much of the state.

31:26.164 --> 31:41.205
And so those things had opportunities to go to the high schools, to the research and extension centers, because at that time, Dr. Kunkel, he was emphasizing, let us do the research and extension.

31:41.185 --> 31:43.810
out in the state where those issues arise.

31:44.110 --> 31:46.595
And so they put in all these districts throughout the state.

31:47.076 --> 32:00.780
So that gave me a chance to travel to some of those and meet with the people and put on, when I got in the dean's office in 1970, I was able to put on science days at those research and extension centers and invite the

32:00.895 --> 32:06.782
like the high school students from those high schools to come and observe science in action.

32:07.122 --> 32:09.265
And that was a great thing too.

32:09.285 --> 32:15.252
And it caused me to learn the people, and particularly like in the valley, where I didn't know much about at all.

32:16.193 --> 32:22.380
And to try to get the Hispanic students to come to A&M was quite a task, but we finally got the guys coming.

32:22.782 --> 32:27.795
And then later we got the ladies coming, and now that's a great recruiting area for Texas Indians.

32:27.815 --> 32:28.597
They love Aggies.

32:29.480 --> 32:37.180
As a Tennessean, did you find it, since so many Tennesseans came to Texas 150 years ago,

32:37.514 --> 32:41.983
Did you find it comparatively easy to understand the accents?

32:42.224 --> 32:42.684
Oh, yes, sir.

32:42.965 --> 32:44.107
No problem at all there.

32:44.568 --> 32:51.061
The only thing you have trouble understanding when you come in the state of Texas is you can't be a Texan unless you're born here.

32:53.266 --> 32:54.468
Did anybody ever tell you that?

32:54.609 --> 32:55.410
Oh, sometimes.

32:55.430 --> 32:59.218
They say, man, where's your Aggie ring, you know?

32:59.198 --> 33:05.367
And I tell them, well, I didn't graduate at A&M, and I wasn't born in Texas.

33:05.487 --> 33:07.750
And they say, well, you ought to be.

33:09.332 --> 33:15.461
Did you ever have any good experiences about how to pronounce the name of a town or a county?

33:15.481 --> 33:21.710
Oh, lots of them, like Mahaya.

33:21.730 --> 33:22.932
But there have been lots of them.

33:22.952 --> 33:26.497
And, of course, you know, we had that trouble with one while ago.

33:26.857 --> 33:28.159
But it's...

33:29.202 --> 33:35.108
A lot of it's based upon the Indians that were here a lot of the times.

33:35.349 --> 33:44.278
You want to learn how the local pronounce it before you try to pronounce it because you'll obviously show that you're an outsider if you don't.

33:44.298 --> 33:55.310
All right, so as you immersed yourself in the teaching and other activities of being a faculty member, what were your guidelines?

33:55.370 --> 33:58.213
What were your rules of operation?

33:59.425 --> 34:06.761
Well, I wanted to do something that made a difference, like whether it's in research or whether it's in teaching students.

34:07.002 --> 34:16.523
I wanted them to, I remember Dr. Potts, he made a comment to any young person who came to Texas A&M, and I agreed with this.

34:16.503 --> 34:22.112
that it ought to make a difference in their life back in their community or wherever they go to work.

34:22.612 --> 34:26.819
So because they went to Texas A.M., the world is better for it, and Texas is better for it.

34:26.839 --> 34:28.802
So I use that as more or less as a guide.

34:29.223 --> 34:36.894
I want them to learn the subject matter, but I want them to be able to apply this out in our state to make it a better place.

34:37.295 --> 34:40.620
And then on our research, I look for...

34:41.022 --> 34:47.709
significant issues that are not being addressed or need to be addressed or that are not being properly addressed.

34:47.909 --> 34:48.429
Such as?

34:48.590 --> 34:54.135
Well, in recent times, we hadn't paid enough attention, I didn't think, to the urban areas of Texas.

34:54.455 --> 35:01.683
So I did quite a bit of work with turf industry, golf courses, homes, and the landscaping.

35:02.203 --> 35:05.526
And that's a real significant industry in Texas.

35:06.047 --> 35:09.190
Maybe $6 billion more a year is spent.

35:09.642 --> 35:14.789
for maintaining those kinds of resources.

35:15.290 --> 35:20.937
And then another one that recently has been the damage that the fire ants are doing to our urban areas.

35:21.458 --> 35:23.441
So I've been on one of those projects.

35:23.621 --> 35:36.739
And then another one I'm working on now has to do with how we dispose of the biomass that's created by these intensive livestock operations so that it's environmentally kind and all that.

35:36.759 --> 35:39.042
So those are some issues that I've been involved with

35:39.325 --> 35:43.894
But in our department, there have been a lot like the risk factors.

35:43.914 --> 35:52.752
Texas is a very high risk agricultural area because of weather and water and things like that and not available and the prices too.

35:52.832 --> 35:55.157
And then some of the change has been made in policy.

35:55.829 --> 36:01.998
But those are the kinds of things that guide me, and I get excited about it when I see that you can make a difference.

36:02.599 --> 36:08.347
Whether it's in the life of a person or whether it's in the economy of Texas, I think we need to make a difference.

36:08.368 --> 36:21.567
We may be in a classroom, but if we're in a classroom, in a laboratory, we ought to have our vision outside of that, how it's affecting the people and how it's affecting the land and where we work and play and live.

36:22.323 --> 36:32.113
As you, in those early years... Okay, keep going.

36:35.182 --> 36:49.705
In those early years, were there some achievements, events for you personally that led you to believe you were making progress on your self-appointed goals?

36:49.725 --> 36:50.126
Oh, yes.

36:50.607 --> 37:02.185
When I saw that we became the largest agricultural college in the United States, and CBS was so impressed, they came down and did a documentary on our college

37:02.620 --> 37:04.003
That was pretty impressive.

37:04.023 --> 37:13.988
They met our students, they saw the kind of campus we had, and to me that was more or less a confirmation that we were doing some good.

37:14.689 --> 37:18.779
Who deserves credit for that accomplishment then?

37:19.040 --> 37:20.764
Well, I would say

37:21.132 --> 37:25.118
a team effort like Dr. Kunkel and Dr. R.C.

37:25.138 --> 37:38.719
Potts and also our county agents worked with all the high schools throughout the state and then of course our departments were at that time were pushing forward to trying to

37:39.256 --> 38:02.580
gain recognition and do an outstanding job and they were really really growing because you can imagine growing from like a little less than 1600 students to 40 nearly 4200 and and that was in a period of like five years you know that was a fantastic growth but at the same time you know women were coming to the campus and that's probably where the greatest credit goes is

38:02.932 --> 38:07.005
permitting women, and they were, I'll never forget that though.

38:07.286 --> 38:15.793
We'd get radio stations, newspapers, and television stations would be calling us about all this going on with all the women majoring in agriculture.

38:16.060 --> 38:17.702
what in the world are they going to do?

38:17.762 --> 38:21.367
And I said, well, do they have labels on them, men or women jobs?

38:21.447 --> 38:23.250
And they would say, no, I don't guess they do.

38:23.870 --> 38:25.252
And they said, well, what can women do?

38:25.553 --> 38:27.075
Anything they want to, you know.

38:27.495 --> 38:33.343
So I finally convinced them that this is not news, it's just what it ought to be.

38:33.503 --> 38:40.212
And so that was impressive to me to see that we were able to really start giving a,

38:40.664 --> 38:48.015
more or less a more comprehensive education and move from this concept of a college to a university environment and it worked.

38:48.716 --> 38:56.087
Can you share some of the experiences from those days of you or any of your colleagues relating to women?

38:56.668 --> 39:01.896
There must be some that were very satisfying, there must have been some that were a little humorous.

39:02.517 --> 39:12.948
My experience with women students had always been outstanding here because the women came with the same basic values as the guys, and they didn't change the university.

39:13.749 --> 39:21.777
The university changed because they were here, but they had the same basic values and wanted to get a good education and go back out and work.

39:22.278 --> 39:28.424
And as I visited with ladies in my classes, they were the best students.

39:28.504 --> 39:29.585
I mean, they were good students.

39:29.725 --> 39:31.427
They were there to get an education.

39:31.880 --> 39:35.065
and not to get an MRS degree, or whatever they call it, you know.

39:35.506 --> 39:36.948
They were here to get an education.

39:37.589 --> 39:40.033
Now, and I was impressed.

39:40.153 --> 39:51.051
And as you look through, even today, the leadership, the presence of clubs and organizations, you'll find that women are just as competitive as anybody else.

39:51.151 --> 39:54.276
And so it didn't ruin A&M, and I know

39:55.370 --> 39:58.114
Old Army might have thought it would, but it didn't.

39:58.134 --> 40:09.471
Do you remember hearing any of your colleagues who stumbled or had a little bit of embarrassment when they forgot that there were women in the classroom?

40:09.872 --> 40:15.420
Oh, that happens all the time because it, as most people refer to,

40:15.755 --> 40:21.547
only one gender when they speak, and you can hear them correct themselves pretty fast.

40:21.867 --> 40:31.327
But some teachers just were still prejudiced toward women and would say that if you're determined to be in here, you're gonna have to be good.

40:31.667 --> 40:35.856
And then once the female student accepted that and went on,

40:36.697 --> 40:42.123
The professor accepted them, too, and they were good students, and he didn't hold the prejudice against them.

40:42.604 --> 40:57.081
As you went around the state in the late 60s, did you find much reservation among the citizens of Texas about coeducation at A&M and making the Corps volunteer and racial integration?

40:57.862 --> 41:02.327
Well, of the first two, there seemed to still be, they didn't know it.

41:02.587 --> 41:04.830
They didn't know that they could go to A&M.

41:05.080 --> 41:06.421
Then no women could go here.

41:06.802 --> 41:08.904
And they didn't know they could go without being in the Corps.

41:11.107 --> 41:18.375
But there wasn't a big issue about the racial issues because they came at the same time they admitted women.

41:18.855 --> 41:23.200
And it seemed like the focus was on women rather than on the race issue.

41:23.921 --> 41:30.208
And I remember one of the outstanding guys that came here from St.

41:30.248 --> 41:31.109
Augustine, Texas.

41:31.169 --> 41:32.650
His name is Frederick McClure.

41:33.331 --> 41:34.092
And I used to...

41:34.308 --> 41:40.300
I visited with him when he was in high school, about coming to A&M, and he wondered, Dr. Lord, how am I going to get a date?

41:41.202 --> 41:43.506
I'll have to go all the way down to wherever, you know.

41:44.468 --> 41:46.452
He ended up marrying a lady from over at St.

41:46.492 --> 41:48.416
Marcus, you know.

41:48.436 --> 41:51.743
Do you remember your first impression of Fred when you first met him?

41:52.600 --> 42:18.540
great talented person I teased him about that when the Lord gave out talents he went back for seconds that was my first impression of Frederick and and it's neat that the fact that during the centennial year of A&M he had the chance to be student body president and he was and when we had the recognition of A&M's hundredth anniversary and we had these

42:19.178 --> 42:22.825
speakers here like John Connelly and all those different big speakers.

42:23.225 --> 42:27.072
And then they had Frederick go up and give a response from the student body.

42:27.633 --> 42:35.667
And to the person, they looked like, man, I wish I hadn't spoken today because as you know what an orator Fred was and still is.

42:35.808 --> 42:38.773
As you know, he's vice chair of the Board of Regents now.

42:39.243 --> 42:41.127
and he was an ag economics major.

42:41.287 --> 42:55.214
And he was gonna go at one time, you know, like be a medical doctor in biochemistry, but he finally ended up in ag economics and then went on to law school and he's been in politics ever since.

42:55.234 --> 43:01.707
Except now he's in the business world, but I still think he's a politician.

43:01.687 --> 43:05.291
He had been a national FFA?

43:05.551 --> 43:09.556
He was the state FFA president and national FFA secretary.

43:10.237 --> 43:16.604
And he was the first of his ethnic background to hold that national office, I think, wasn't he?

43:16.644 --> 43:24.693
Well, I know he was in Texas, the first African-American president of the Texas FFA.

43:25.594 --> 43:27.657
But he probably was at the national level.

43:27.697 --> 43:29.098
I don't know that, though, as a fact.

43:29.118 --> 43:30.580
Did you have him in class?

43:30.560 --> 43:41.275
I did not have him in class, but I visited with him and worked with him on many occasions, and being in the dean's office in student affairs, so I had a chance to know him well.

43:41.756 --> 43:44.419
And his family are wonderful people.

43:44.460 --> 43:50.728
He came back to give the Aggie muster here, and he reflected on his dad, you know, and his parents.

43:50.748 --> 43:55.275
They were schoolteachers and principals, and they had a big, big influence on him.

43:56.116 --> 44:00.482
And he loved A&M, and he was,

44:00.968 --> 44:06.406
It was just the right time for him and all of his talents and abilities were superb.

44:06.426 --> 44:09.898
And I'm sure glad he came to A&M because he was looking at other places.

44:10.705 --> 44:23.801
In those years, with Fred as an exceptional example, did you as a faculty member encounter any student difficulties over race?

44:23.841 --> 44:24.962
Did, were there?

44:26.604 --> 44:27.606
Not really.

44:27.846 --> 44:36.156
I mean, I asked Fred those questions and he said, you know, he heard some actions or saw some things that were prejudiced at times.

44:36.440 --> 44:37.962
He knew how to handle it, see.

44:38.643 --> 44:43.771
If you called him a name, he would say, oh, that sounds a little racist to me.

44:43.871 --> 44:45.233
Let's don't address that right.

44:45.814 --> 44:48.338
And again, like that, and people corrected themselves.

44:48.598 --> 44:51.282
Frederick knew how to handle situations like that.

44:51.422 --> 44:54.567
It's my impression that, as you mentioned a while ago,

44:54.547 --> 45:00.353
that for old Aggies, it was women and Voluntary Corps that worried them.

45:00.473 --> 45:01.614
Oh, those were the big issues.

45:01.715 --> 45:07.621
It was not race and was not Hispanics being here.

45:09.002 --> 45:17.051
But see, you have to look back and the race issue at A&M was a late issue compared to other campuses across the nation.

45:17.511 --> 45:21.195
So there was enough information around to know that that's

45:21.175 --> 45:24.880
We need to be in the modern times.

45:25.561 --> 45:27.303
I think that helped A&M a lot.

45:28.445 --> 45:40.281
As this growth and progress was coming in the late 60s and early 70s, what did you hear from other land-grant schools around the country about A&M's progress?

45:40.261 --> 46:05.391
they were impressed and they wanted to know how are you growing so fast and what are you doing and they want to share with us in our programs and we would come they'd come and review our programs and take the information back to their schools it was it was going it was gaining a lot of national recognition and and I think they were very very complimentary about what was happening I don't remember any

46:05.708 --> 46:06.670
negatives about it.

46:06.750 --> 46:08.654
It was all good.

46:09.335 --> 46:16.711
Did the college and or department leadership have any other institutions that you think they were using as models?

46:20.018 --> 46:21.220
I don't

46:21.706 --> 46:39.940
I think they pointed at one, but they looked at some of the great agricultural colleges, like you could look at the Midwest and maybe one in California, but those would probably be, and maybe even one in the Ivy League here at Cornell.

46:40.221 --> 46:44.068
But they had a few programs there and maybe one over on that.
