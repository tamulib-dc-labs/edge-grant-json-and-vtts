WEBVTT

00:02.073 --> 00:24.486
I think this is I think this kind of thing is 
probably sorely needed and I say that partly

00:02.073 --> 00:24.486
because right now we've got a new department head 
and and I'm sure that and we've got six people in

00:02.073 --> 00:24.486
soil science retiring me being one of them Milford 
being another and others coming so so we need uh uh

00:24.685 --> 00:27.890
We need to be able to look at ourselves 
differently. I think we need to be able to look at

00:28.230 --> 00:37.344
ourselves department, experiment station, and 
college.

00:38.586 --> 00:48.921
And I wish there were a way that the university 
could assess all levels of performance. We're not

00:49.120 --> 00:54.047
like industry, and I don't think we should do 
things quite the same way that they do

00:49.120 --> 00:54.047
necessarily. But on the other hand, I think we have 
to face the same reality as they do. And I think the

00:58.474 --> 01:00.136
sooner we can... Here's something that's in the 
university that I think is a real deterrent. Too

01:05.725 --> 01:08.108
many long titles. What does one know about a man 
who's got, he's dean, he's director, he's, you

01:10.332 --> 01:18.082
know, and on and on and on. I know from, it just 
happens my wife writes very well by hand. She has

01:24.170 --> 01:31.480
addressed lots of invitations for certain people 
on this campus in high places. Whenever you have to

01:31.848 --> 01:40.186
cover up half of the envelope with a man's titles, 
that's something's out of line as far as the public

01:31.848 --> 01:40.186
goes. And I think we need to streamline titles some 
way and make them functional. And I suspect we

01:49.617 --> 02:03.398
probably ought to streamline the amount of tenure 
that people have in a given administrative post,

01:49.617 --> 02:03.398
even though it's comfortable for people. And I 
have a high regard for our administrators. I think

02:07.825 --> 02:12.075
probably some more changes are needed. All right. 
I have just about finished all of the questions I

02:16.747 --> 02:21.258
have. What have we not touched on that we should 
have?

02:29.628 --> 02:44.399
I

02:29.628 --> 02:44.399
would say that one of the nice things about here is 
that we do have the opportunity to interact with

02:29.628 --> 02:44.399
some very nice students in social settings. It 
just happens that I go to the church across the

02:45.522 --> 02:48.548
street. not that it wouldn't have been just as well 
as many others, but what you'd say the student

02:49.203 --> 03:00.225
foundations around our campus certainly being a 
part of those and interacting with the students in

03:01.252 --> 03:12.347
those is a privilege and an opportunity and an 
important part of our academic life, as I see. And I

03:13.248 --> 03:17.313
haven't done more than my share, but I've enjoyed 
what I've done. And I hope to continue some of that.

03:23.842 --> 03:28.508
I think that we all need to keep our breadth Just as I 
said earlier that I go on field trips a lot. I don't

03:34.016 --> 03:40.044
know what kind of field trips people need in other 
disciplines, but in soil science you have to go

03:34.016 --> 03:40.044
into the field. And one of the things that I worked 
into to my core teaching some years ago was a

03:48.248 --> 03:57.178
half-day field trip in which I try to illustrate 
the high points of the course in terms of minerals.

03:57.198 --> 04:00.562
And that's evolved through our research. And 
every site we go to, we have some kind of a research

04:00.902 --> 04:12.775
base for 20 specimens of different conditions, 
wetlands, mine lands, soil. And I think that's

04:13.716 --> 04:15.218
important. One thing that I didn't mention, for I 
think 16 years, I was the chair of the teaching clay

04:15.653 --> 04:31.216
mineralogy

04:15.653 --> 04:31.216
symposium of the International Clay Society. It 
meets every four years. Well, that was a great

04:34.741 --> 04:37.745
opportunity. It kind of fitted in with the fact 
that I taught seminar for about that number of

04:38.146 --> 04:45.036
years in the department, graduate seminar in soil 
science. And I was privileged in that to interact

04:46.231 --> 04:59.691
with a diversity of people and ask them to 
participate as well as put something into the

04:46.231 --> 04:59.691
program myself. And I think that we need more of 
that as far out as we can reach. Sigma Xi and the

05:09.434 --> 05:20.804
people in chemistry have done the best job that I 
know about on campus by cutting across scientific

05:09.434 --> 05:20.804
barriers and bringing people together. There's a 
little chemistry in so many phases of science, and

05:21.265 --> 05:27.390
a whole lot of some. And I think that sort of thing is 
really important.

05:35.437 --> 05:38.580
And in this chromium work that I mentioned to you, I 
got down to the end of publishing that paper and got

05:39.455 --> 05:47.267
a really good set of reviews on that manuscript. 
And one of them said you should have data on the

05:47.907 --> 05:57.542
electronic status of those manganese oxides.

06:01.487 --> 06:03.951
Well, that was not something I had ever done. 
Didn't have an instrument in my department to do

06:05.033 --> 06:07.977
that. So I ferreted out a person in chemistry who 
turned out to be a well-spoken Chinaman who had

06:09.458 --> 06:26.522
finished his doctor's degree in chemistry and was 
badly needed in publication. very much agreed if

06:27.008 --> 06:32.919
he had helped me define the electronic status in 
those minerals. And within a week, we had done the

06:33.921 --> 06:37.288
most of that. And it'll appear in the journal 
within the next few months. And so that's the kind

06:41.997 --> 06:49.371
of cross-fertilization that we need a lot more of. 
And I think we'd welcome a lot of administrators

06:50.735 --> 07:05.142
back into the teaching lecture halls and back into 
the research laboratories if that could ever be

06:50.735 --> 07:05.142
managed. Anything else we've left out that we need 
to be sure to cover?

07:11.693 --> 07:15.739
I think every scientist needs some skills in 
addition to theory. Mine happens to be electron

07:17.061 --> 07:21.768
microscopy and x-ray diffraction and a few of 
those. You sound like a land grant person as

07:23.490 --> 07:29.059
compared to a theoretical university person. 
Yes, that's right. I mentioned sabbaticals. The

07:33.245 --> 07:40.215
travel is really important and it's built well 
into my profession. And I think that, I don't know

07:40.651 --> 07:51.106
how it fits everybody, but I think a great many of us 
as scholars, we need to do a significant amount of

07:40.651 --> 07:51.106
traveling. How adequate have you found the 
library resources here when you needed?

08:01.300 --> 08:03.042
They have generally been quite good. Being in a 
focused area, and I have usually taken Sometimes

08:09.608 --> 08:12.914
as many as 12 journals, right now it's not that 
many. But I have my library, three different

08:14.016 --> 08:20.948
bookcases in a row in my office. And my group uses 
them more than any others. And the computer is

08:25.235 --> 08:28.320
helping us a lot in that regard. But I think we just, 
as I see it, we sort of gradually kept ahead of not

08:28.761 --> 08:35.652
being so good. Like the library that's been built 
on West Campus is a tremendous asset to us. But

08:41.863 --> 08:47.412
we've got to equip it with our journals and things. 
Just as we're doing that, we're merging into the

08:47.881 --> 08:56.013
electronic age of publishing, and we don't quite 
know how that's all going to come together. So I

08:56.033 --> 08:58.917
guess we have to run faster.

09:03.523 --> 09:15.981
Something that I've touched on just a little, and 
I'll just mention again, and that is that, and this

09:03.523 --> 09:15.981
is something I have invested a little of my own 
money into through a scholarship, having readily

09:17.530 --> 09:21.786
available money. so that when a scientist from 
anywhere in the world says, I want to come and work

09:22.289 --> 09:37.444
with you for a summer or a term or a month or 
something, you can say with confidence, well, we

09:22.289 --> 09:37.444
can work it out. And we do much better at 
complimenting people for what they want to do. In

09:46.773 --> 09:50.857
this case, it would be kind of like a mini 
sabbatical type of thing. Or maybe it would. with

09:52.107 --> 09:55.491
somebody else's money make it into a sabbatical. 
We're always, I think, having opportunities with

09:57.253 --> 10:13.694
people from Africa or the Middle East or some 
remote little tropical country that has very

09:57.253 --> 10:13.694
limited resources and equipment. They need to 
have some help, and they have the least money. and

10:19.073 --> 10:44.052
of course the same thing applies to students but it 
can work here again we have to get out of our box it

10:19.073 --> 10:44.052
can work helping graduate students it can also 
work helping a faculty member who has to go back and

10:19.073 --> 10:44.052
support his family in mexico but he can work in 
increments it challenges our degree granting way

10:19.073 --> 10:44.052
of doing they may end up getting his doctor's 
degree in Mexico and doing his basic research at

10:44.369 --> 10:52.163
A&M, but that's all right if that's what it takes, 
as I see it. I've encountered that. I think you've

10:54.047 --> 10:55.630
done well. Should A&M attempt to get any larger?

11:02.322 --> 11:04.826
That's kind of like asking about gravity or the 
weather. I think it's really hard to give a good

11:04.907 --> 11:08.453
answer on that. I'd say that's not probably going 
to be decided by faculty like me. I would say what we

11:14.698 --> 11:21.295
need to do, we need to create cultural villages, 
scientific and cultural villages, and promote

11:22.338 --> 11:32.838
the interaction within them and among them. And 
that's the way I believe we can meet the public's

11:34.200 --> 11:39.891
need and meet our local need. We just finished. 
Last year we had a little black young lady from

11:43.341 --> 11:49.010
Corpus to come and work. She's a junior in high 
school. This is a part of their programs. They

11:53.577 --> 11:57.282
called it ALPS program, moving to higher planes. 
This year they called it high school student

11:57.302 --> 12:00.387
research. Less students. We had one from Houston 
this year. When that student came in, tall, very

12:05.217 --> 12:24.945
attractive, both McGann and other, black 
student, doesn't matter with me, very well

12:05.217 --> 12:24.945
groomed, presented herself very well, came out of 
I think one of the best high schools in Houston

12:05.217 --> 12:24.945
area, call it a century school I think. She had much 
more spirit.

12:30.854 --> 12:33.317
After she interacted with that group, I think she 
turned back into her high schoolish perspective.

12:42.477 --> 12:46.504
And as I look at it, we accomplished quite a lot. And 
so much so I'm trying to get her data book back now.

12:49.208 --> 12:54.416
She took it with her and we're exchanging letters 
and phone calls on that. But that experience in

12:56.920 --> 13:03.490
those two years has taught me that we need to we need 
to help these young people when they come in, fit

13:04.027 --> 13:12.039
into our cultural setting in a constructive way. 
And if I were doing it, if I had to have one next

13:13.000 --> 13:24.297
summer, which I have no idea whether I will or not, I 
will make it a point to spend myself or somebody in

13:13.000 --> 13:24.297
my group every lunch hour for the first week with 
that young person. Showing them different things

13:29.165 --> 13:34.570
that relate to the culture of the campus or relate 
to the science we're trying to project. And not let

13:35.291 --> 13:42.799
them get back into this very immature teenage

13:35.291 --> 13:42.799
frame. That's all I can say. All right, my next to 
last question then. Let's make believe someone

13:47.824 --> 13:50.807
hands you a check for a million dollars. with one 
condition, you must pass that check on to Texas

13:53.116 --> 14:00.067
A&M, but you decide what is to be done with that 
money. If you had the capability to make a

14:01.149 --> 14:09.762
meaningful gift to Texas A&M, for what purpose 
would you want the gift used? What's your favorite

14:09.782 --> 14:14.550
project or task or game? Well, you know, you 
really, excuse me, You really put me on the spot,

14:21.432 --> 14:30.812
because I'm obviously very selfishly oriented 
about something I know something about that I've

14:21.432 --> 14:30.812
studied about for a long time. I think if I had a 
million dollars with the freedom to use it in Texas

14:32.315 --> 14:42.276
A&M, I would try to set up a program that embraced 
the most basic parts of the science that I know

14:44.804 --> 15:01.513
something about, soils and such, and extend it to 
include the consumer.

15:03.333 --> 15:11.624
In other words, I would try to integrate basic 
research and extension as it's perceived in a

15:03.333 --> 15:11.624
classic sense. And I'd like to apply it perhaps to a 
given kind of a problem for maybe for five years.

15:20.156 --> 15:28.868
And then try to wrap it up and then perhaps move to 
another kind of a problem for the next five years.

15:29.089 --> 15:32.293
And pull in faculty into that. And that way we could 
not only be seeing what we do at the molecular level

15:32.273 --> 15:54.505
here, and a lot of our science can be done at the 
molecular level and move ahead much faster, but we

15:32.273 --> 15:54.505
need to spend part of our time out there in the 
applications area. And I think with that kind of an

15:54.525 --> 15:59.833
assemblage and an active group, I think it would 
be, we could efficiently use the resources from a

16:00.269 --> 16:05.294
million dollars. Okay, last question. After 
about a third of a century here, what feelings do

16:08.137 --> 16:13.843
you carry in your heart for Texas A&M? Well, it's a 
great place to work. It's a great place to work

16:18.408 --> 16:26.597
because it offers a lot of freedom, it offers quite 
a bit of support. It's dwindling in some respects.

16:29.927 --> 16:30.929
Not in every respect. The student money that's 
been plowed back into our department has been our

16:32.731 --> 16:39.842
salvation in recent years. I don't know if that's 
the best way to go or not, but that's the way it's

16:41.284 --> 16:44.108
going. It certainly helps.

16:50.067 --> 16:54.912
I'm just, I'm kind of tired now, and I guess I didn't 
do very well with your last question. No, no, no.

16:55.753 --> 16:57.274
Say again what your last question was. What 
feelings do you carry in your heart about Texas

16:57.294 --> 17:02.740
A&M?

17:03.561 --> 17:07.585
I'm not beyond being emotional, but I'm not very 
emotional, really. I'm more factual oriented, I

17:07.665 --> 17:10.368
think.

17:14.772 --> 17:16.294
I really like the the high purpose that A&M has 
exemplified in its selection of leaders, and the

17:18.400 --> 17:34.984
fact that I've gotten to know a significant number 
of them, but I don't go out beating the bushes to

17:18.400 --> 17:34.984
meet people very much. And I'm glad to be able to go 
anywhere else in the country and say I work for

17:36.887 --> 17:48.323
Texas A&M, and there are a lot of good people there 
doing their best. And there's a good ending right

17:49.754 --> 17:51.850
there.
