WEBVTT

00:01.145 --> 00:06.631
who's Professor of Health and Physical Education 
and has been at Texas A&M since 1972. We're going to

00:06.651 --> 00:21.628
talk about this department primarily and the 
impact of changes in at Texas A&M and how it has

00:06.651 --> 00:21.628
affected the college, I mean the Department of 
Health and Physical Education. So if we can just

00:22.189 --> 00:30.358
talk to, well from 1972 that you arrived, what are 
some of the major things that you have seen happen

00:30.777 --> 00:33.240
And you're talking about the department rather 
than the college. Well, both. Because I mean, the

00:35.803 --> 00:41.751
department is an integral part of the college, so 
we'll probably be talking about both, but it can be

00:35.803 --> 00:41.751
either. I probably can respond better to the 
department. OK, that would be great. All right.

00:46.697 --> 00:50.982
I'll try to do a bunch. All right. I think one of the 
major changes that have had impact on the entire

00:51.823 --> 00:59.653
college as well as the department is the 
enrollment explosion. When I came in 1972, we had

01:03.761 --> 01:09.667
about 18,000 students, I guess. And for four or 
five years after that, we added the equivalent of a

01:09.687 --> 01:18.958
small college, a state college, each year. That's 
had major impact on us, I think. Then the other

01:23.623 --> 01:27.447
thing that happened was, as that enrollment grew 
larger, the proportion of civilian students,

01:28.861 --> 01:36.389
so-called civilian students, to Corps of Cadets 
changed. The Corps still remained a viable force

01:36.409 --> 01:41.014
on this campus. But when I first came here in 1972, 
about half of my class would be wearing uniforms,

01:41.575 --> 01:47.982
at least. And now we see one every now and then. 
Nobody has mentioned that. That's interesting. I

01:55.550 --> 01:58.834
think that's made, it's allowed some things to 
happen. not necessarily for the better, but

01:59.590 --> 02:05.737
different than what they would have evolved had 
the Corps continued to be the dominant. Though it

02:06.298 --> 02:13.766
still is a very strong force, it's not the dominant 
force it was in 1972 when I came.

02:15.708 --> 02:26.340
I think you have to identify the changing of the 
guard at the dean's office as one of the things that

02:15.708 --> 02:26.340
happened that made a difference. Dean Hubert, 
when he was Dean, I think it was important for us to

02:27.147 --> 02:51.699
have gone through that period of time with him 
because he was a very strong person, had strong

02:27.147 --> 02:51.699
ideas, often domineering and autocratic, but 
nevertheless, once you convinced him that

02:27.147 --> 02:51.699
something needed to happen, you could pretty well 
count on it happening because he pushed it through

02:27.147 --> 02:51.699
the university in the same fashion. Dean Corrigan 
came along though with an entirely different

02:54.350 --> 03:01.824
orientation and a much broader vision of what 
education is all about. I'm not sure I want that.

03:03.988 --> 03:07.234
Well, I'm getting that from everybody. It's a 
very, very similar type of perception or

03:07.294 --> 03:12.483
observation. And it is. It's leadership style. 
It's 180 degree difference. And that's valid.

03:18.177 --> 03:34.311
what I'm hearing is that, you know, we got what we 
needed at the time, and then this one was right for

03:18.177 --> 03:34.311
these times, and so change is inevitable, and that 
leadership that Hubert had was so necessary. At

03:34.992 --> 03:46.902
the time, I expect that's right, and it was a 
materialistic, materialistic

03:34.992 --> 03:46.902
approach to administration, and we were a 
military school at that time, almost

03:34.992 --> 03:46.902
exclusively. But even so, Dean Corrigan has 
opened up an entirely different way of looking at

03:47.101 --> 03:56.014
things. When you went to, as an administrator, 
when you went to Dean Hubert's office, you made

03:56.074 --> 04:06.850
sure that you were well prepared and you rehearsed 
and you didn't make any mistakes. Now that was good

04:07.531 --> 04:11.837
in that it made you do your homework. It was bad in 
that there was no room for experimenting and

04:11.857 --> 04:15.943
creativity. In Dean Corrigan's case, on the other 
hand, nothing is sacred. You can say what's on your

04:20.953 --> 04:22.375
mind. He allows you to experiment with ideas and 
thoughts and things. Consequently, I think

04:27.542 --> 04:35.493
creativity is higher than it's ever been because 
of that. Another change that occurred, both at the

04:35.513 --> 04:46.167
college and the department level, it was 
extremely important at the departmental level,

04:35.513 --> 04:46.167
but it was because of college change that allowed 
us to And that is that we began to look at the College

04:46.670 --> 04:56.584
of Education, and this department especially, as 
being not just teacher preparation as its

04:46.670 --> 04:56.584
mission. That we were preparing educators not 
just for the public schools. That made all the

05:03.314 --> 05:06.538
difference in the world in our program. When did 
that come about, more or less? It's hard to say. It

05:10.063 --> 05:16.272
was beginning to happen around 1972 when I came. I 
think it was a case of the barrier was beginning to

05:16.437 --> 05:22.505
erode along then. Probably it was 74, 75, or 
somewhere along in there before it really was

05:22.925 --> 05:28.533
formalized. And I can't recall the year, but I know 
the event. What we introduced was a curriculum in

05:33.879 --> 05:38.826
something we call American Humanics. The 
American Humanics was a broad-based program

05:39.927 --> 05:45.955
across campus in which You prepared people for 
human services like scout masters and executive

05:46.340 --> 06:00.839
directors of boy scout and girl scout programs and 
YMCA programs and things like that, social type

05:46.340 --> 06:00.839
programs. So we began to advertise a program in 
which you could get a degree in physical education

06:00.859 --> 06:13.596
and health education and not necessarily be 
prepared yourself to teach in public schools.

06:13.947 --> 06:21.398
EDCL, on the other hand, was a little slower in 
evolving at that point, but they have evolved at

06:13.947 --> 06:21.398
that point, especially with their graduate 
programs. And what's happened there is that

06:21.418 --> 06:29.550
colleges of medicine across the country began to 
become real concerned about the kind of teachers

06:21.418 --> 06:29.550
they were. The worst teaching in the world for a 
long time was in colleges of medicine. It may still

06:34.557 --> 06:36.681
be, I don't know, but I think it's a lot better. And 
here was a group of people who were really

06:37.482 --> 06:43.110
well-versed in pedagogy. And they began to see 
themselves as educational directors of colleges

06:43.664 --> 06:48.931
of medicine. And they began to hire those type of 
people in colleges of medicine. Several texts

06:53.698 --> 06:59.446
were published on medical education along about 
that time. And that made a lot of difference to us

06:59.466 --> 07:09.740
because roughly half our students, our majors 
now, are not in teacher preparation. I think

07:09.760 --> 07:13.165
that's important because our field of physical 
education has always had more people prepared to

07:13.955 --> 07:20.561
teach than there were room for them to teach. And we 
didn't need those many folks. Has the department

07:24.164 --> 07:27.327
been growing steadily still? We've been staying 
about the same for the past, oh, seven years, I

07:27.387 --> 07:34.553
guess, maybe eight years. Which is about how many? 
About 800 majors. Now that includes, that's

07:37.356 --> 07:41.920
undergrad.

07:42.980 --> 07:45.684
So about 70, that's going to depend on when you 
count. It's between 700 and 800 at all times. How

07:49.670 --> 07:51.072
about graduates? I'm going to guess again, but 
roughly we have about 200 graduate students. Now,

07:55.879 --> 07:58.102
that includes all of our programs. That's health 
education, physical education, and then all the

07:58.242 --> 08:08.717
specializations, which includes exercise 
physiology and motor learning. How

08:09.102 --> 08:16.690
have those all been created or come into being? You 
know, there's so much diversity in the department

08:16.890 --> 08:25.058
now, and I don't think anybody, until they come and 
see this facility, realize the kinds of things

08:16.890 --> 08:25.058
that you're doing. At least I didn't until we saw it 
for the Development Council, and that was a real

08:25.098 --> 08:30.284
eye-opener. How do you get that across? How do 
people find out that it's here, and then how did it

08:31.725 --> 08:37.371
happen? We suffer from the knowledge curve in that 
regard. We still do. Still there are people who

08:44.612 --> 08:45.813
don't know. When they hear the word physical 
education, they think basketball and track and

08:46.795 --> 08:53.223
roll out the ball type thing. But it's getting 
better. My perception of our reputation on this

08:55.226 --> 09:00.973
campus is that it's very, very good and it's 
getting better. And I think to a large extent it's

09:00.993 --> 09:05.179
because of our association with the faculty 
senate. When the faculty senate was created, That

09:07.557 --> 09:14.065
forced us into interaction with faculty from 
across the campus. Management or

09:14.085 --> 09:35.573
administration, well, administration is not a 
good term, but a tool for making final decisions

09:14.085 --> 09:35.573
for the university was done by the old academic 
council, which was all department heads and deans

09:14.085 --> 09:35.573
and just a few faculty. So with the coming of the 
Faculty Senate, that changed that and threw

09:36.177 --> 09:46.191
faculties together and gave them opportunities 
for mutual understanding of one another. And I

09:46.211 --> 09:47.052
think it's been good. If it doesn't do anything 
else, I think it's been good for them. Are you part

09:50.016 --> 09:52.099
of the Faculty Senate? Fortunately or 
unfortunately, I've been a member of the Senate

09:52.139 --> 09:55.023
since its inception. This is my last year. When was 
it started? Let me see. I'm in my sixth year. Let me

10:02.313 --> 10:03.855
see if that's right now. Well, I can check that out. 
Maybe the fifth year. Okay. Time flies when you

10:07.333 --> 10:08.575
have fun. I believe it's been five years over 
there. Okay. I can count the speakers. There was

10:13.560 --> 10:25.553
McDermott, and then there was Murray Milford, and 
then there was John Lonnie, and Sam Black, and now

10:13.560 --> 10:25.553
Dick Chamoy. So there's speakers in the Senate. So 
this is the fifth year of the Senate. When would I be

10:30.698 --> 10:32.560
able to get some of the... like, say, minutes or 
some of the documents of what's gone on in the

10:33.063 --> 10:38.729
Senate. Are they in the archives? Yes. Patty 
Steele is the person in contact. And she's in the

10:43.113 --> 10:49.600
faculty senate office, which is located in the 
YMCA, the building that's there. I can file.

10:53.804 --> 10:58.248
Janine, what's a good one for faculty senate 
office?

11:00.971 --> 11:01.352
Good one. OK. I imagine that would have some good. 
Oh, she'll have everything. Background

11:03.798 --> 11:10.586
information to hang the College of Education 
decisions and things on, possibly? I would think

11:10.606 --> 11:14.091
so, at least the most recent decisions. Okay. 
Decisions in the last two or three years, in a way.

11:17.375 --> 11:24.904
Is there one, any particular one that you feel have 
decisions of the faculty senate that have

11:17.375 --> 11:24.904
affected the College of Education the most? Oh, 
the core curriculum. Right. Of course, made an

11:27.787 --> 11:30.711
impact on all of our curriculum. it affected 
education less than it did other curricula, like

11:31.130 --> 11:37.716
engineering, for example. Because education has 
always had a strong liberal arts background. And

11:44.521 --> 11:50.546
so in our curriculum, for example, we only had to 
change a couple of courses, and we were in total

11:44.521 --> 11:50.546
compliance. However, we took that opportunity to 
go through a total curriculum revision.

12:01.133 --> 12:05.139
Consequently, we have a curriculum we like a lot 
better than we've had in the past. But now, 994 is

12:05.660 --> 12:11.969
beginning to come along, and so we're not sure how 
that's going to affect. Okay, and the mission of

12:11.989 --> 12:21.864
the college and of your department, I'm sure, is 
still the same as it is for any land grant, which is

12:11.989 --> 12:21.864
the teaching, research, and service. How is that 
balanced in your department, the focus? I think in

12:30.479 --> 12:36.728
any research institution, you've got to have a 
strong research thrust. If you make me put figures

12:37.830 --> 12:46.142
on that, I would say that research is equally as 
important as teaching. And service, or what I

12:47.484 --> 12:56.497
choose to call citizenship, is third in that 
category. However, an individual faculty may

13:00.331 --> 13:02.494
have different priorities. For example, I have 
faculty that I have designated as being

13:02.514 --> 13:07.983
researcher teachers. They work primarily in the 
performance laboratory. And their job is

13:10.427 --> 13:20.483
probably more like 40, 30, 40% research, 30% 
teaching, and then 20% service. And then I have

13:21.244 --> 13:24.950
other faculty who are teacher researchers. In 
that case, they're heavy responsibilities in

13:26.555 --> 13:30.279
teaching, but they also have to do a legitimate 
amount of research. How many do you have on your

13:30.319 --> 13:31.721
faculty? About. It depends on when you ask, but 
about,

13:33.943 --> 13:45.556
well, we have 101 faculty and grad assistants. I 
just counted those last week. That's headcount

13:47.639 --> 13:50.622
now, not FTE. And about 25 of those, or more like 35 
of those, are graduate assistants. So what does

13:56.694 --> 13:57.515
that make? About 70, 76 to 80. Now, a large number of 
those, 35 of them, would be lecturers who teach in

14:00.779 --> 14:08.428
our basic activity program. So we have actual 
prof-soil-ranked faculty are about 28 to 29. OK.

14:19.238 --> 14:25.604
Is there a lot of collaboration among your faculty 
with other departments or even with other

14:19.238 --> 14:25.604
colleges? Quite a bit. A lot of collaboration 
within the department, because you've got motor

14:27.246 --> 14:35.774
learning, for example. It's very difficult for 
them to do any research without collaborating

14:35.794 --> 14:43.382
with exercise physiology and also with 
biomechanics. Those people also collaborate

14:45.604 --> 14:48.807
heavily people in vet school, quite a bit going on 
with engineering right now, particularly

14:48.955 --> 15:02.444
between motor learning and engineering, because 
a lot of the things we're doing in motor learning

14:48.955 --> 15:02.444
relates directly to engineering. What degree 
are, in other words, how are the students Can

15:07.788 --> 15:12.174
students that are in engineering be taking these 
classes, or is that a collaboration? Normally

15:12.194 --> 15:13.336
it's through research. It's research 
collaboration. However, we do have some

15:15.298 --> 15:20.005
engineering students who take some of our 
courses, and of course we take some of theirs. We

15:21.607 --> 15:30.740
take a lot of the veterinary medicine courses, the 
exercise physiology people do, because a lot of

15:21.607 --> 15:30.740
the same information that we need is provided 
there. In fact, they'll take 14 to 16 hours over

15:31.341 --> 15:36.748
there, their doctoral students will. When did the 
doctoral program come into being? Do you know

15:41.391 --> 15:41.931
more? I mean, I've seen it, I just don't. Were you, 
was it already in place when you were here? It was in

15:46.716 --> 15:49.379
place when I came. It was around, and I'm going to 
have to guess, but it was around 68. But Linus

15:52.462 --> 16:00.470
Dowell, to tell you almost precisely if you know 
him, he's on my faculty. Brian Cope, I can get the

16:00.490 --> 16:03.352
same information for you. Now, our health 
education doctoral program didn't come into

16:05.804 --> 16:08.827
existence until about 75. And that's a guess, too, 
but it'll be within two years. 74 or 75. How about

16:18.477 --> 16:26.325
the view, and you mentioned that a little bit in 
passing, about how people don't know about or are

16:18.477 --> 16:26.325
not aware of some of the things that go on. I was 
looking at what are the perceptions of outsiders

16:26.786 --> 16:32.271
of the College of Education. And again, sometimes 
I even have trouble thinking of you all as the

16:35.740 --> 16:41.226
College of Education because you're over here and 
you don't make the connection all the time. What

16:41.667 --> 16:44.430
about people's perceptions outside the college? 
Outside the College of Education or even beyond

16:46.532 --> 16:51.177
that, outside in the external environment? Do you 
know or have a feel for how do people perceive this

16:51.518 --> 16:59.327
area or this department or its contribution? I 
think it's a common mistake often made that People

17:04.765 --> 17:07.629
don't perceive us as being part of education.

17:11.556 --> 17:12.958
There's a lot of common mistakes made. One is they 
perceive us as being all activity, and that's all

17:13.358 --> 17:18.787
we do. Of course, that is a major portion of what we 
do. I don't want to belittle that. We still think

17:22.092 --> 17:24.576
that's pretty important. Then there's a 
misconception that, for example, the folks in

17:24.596 --> 17:31.887
engineering, we're working with our people in our 
human performance laboratory, and didn't even

17:32.187 --> 17:36.251
equate human performance laboratory to the 
department. And so, you know, you have that kind of

17:36.271 --> 17:39.955
thing going on. With a diversified program, 
you've got individual chairs who are leading

17:40.136 --> 17:55.573
those programs who have full freedom because, you 
know, I encourage them to take that full freedom to

17:40.136 --> 17:55.573
engage conversation with their components 
across campus. And here's two subcomponents that

17:55.593 --> 18:01.519
talk to one another and not know who the parent of 
that particular group is. A large university is

18:02.090 --> 18:07.196
really an unstructured thing. When you get right 
down to it, it's really a lot of unstructured

18:07.216 --> 18:12.842
stuff. Now, a lot of programs like mine are not in 
colleges of education, too. Okay, that might be

18:19.950 --> 18:21.091
the problem. And that may be what you were getting 
at. Okay, maybe so. A lot of schools, and I could

18:24.074 --> 18:30.021
name you four or five, have our colleges into 
themselves. The University of Maryland is a good

18:30.811 --> 18:34.557
example of the College of Health and Physical 
Education. In fact, I think they changed their

18:34.577 --> 18:38.543
name recently, but it's still basically the same 
thing. Indiana has that. The University of

18:40.326 --> 18:41.968
Florida has that. Do you think that would ever 
happen here?

18:46.415 --> 18:47.116
I don't. I don't foresee it right immediately. 
What we would like to see happen is for us to be

18:50.121 --> 18:57.433
recognized as a school within the College of 
Education. I've approached Dean Cargan about

18:57.453 --> 18:58.995
this What that would get for us though is as large as 
we are and as much responsibility as division

18:59.330 --> 19:16.335
chairs have, they don't get much recognition for 
that in terms of reallocated time. They're doing

19:17.156 --> 19:18.959
all that off the corner of the desk. They teach a 
full teaching load and then they're managing a

19:18.979 --> 19:23.886
subunit off the side of the desk. If we were 
identified as a school, we could have titles, you

19:24.625 --> 19:32.595
know, university-recognized titles in which 
they could get some reality of time. So there'd be

19:33.336 --> 19:34.798
some advantage to that. Well, you say they're 
working on these off-site, like, give me an

19:34.818 --> 19:38.442
example. Well, Robert Hurley, for example, is a 
full professor of health education, and he

19:38.562 --> 19:45.150
teaches a full teaching load. When I say full, it's 
not quite a full load, but I'm not able to give him as

19:45.170 --> 19:53.721
much release time to manage the health education 
division as I'd like to. So he's, as far as the

19:54.292 --> 20:00.501
university is concerned, he's like any other 
faculty member on campus. But he's got about eight

20:00.521 --> 20:12.038
or nine or ten faculty and a student enrollment of 
about 300 that he manages. And I can't formally

20:12.058 --> 20:15.763
recognize him for that. And should he leave, I 
can't promote someone into his spot and have a

20:15.783 --> 20:23.775
salary increment based on on the administrative 
department because the administrative

20:24.329 --> 20:29.235
department doesn't exist as far as the university 
is concerned. And if it was a school, that would be

20:29.255 --> 20:31.899
all different. That would help solve it. What's 
the dean's reaction? Does he feel that he's...

20:38.267 --> 20:39.388
He's not enamored with it. And I don't really know 
why he's... He may see that as a first step toward

20:44.495 --> 20:49.901
breaking off and becoming a separate college. I 
personally don't view it that way. It may be

20:52.284 --> 20:53.526
that... that he has information from the 
Provost's office that I don't have in terms of the

20:54.063 --> 21:01.013
legitimacy of that. However, I do know that the 
College of Business has one program under it that

21:01.774 --> 21:08.725
is a school of accounting or something like that. 
I'm not sure what it is. Interesting. To say that we

21:12.611 --> 21:16.296
would never become a college, you just don't know. 
But that's not one of the things that we're in.

21:20.253 --> 21:21.495
striving for at this point. We're very happy with 
the administrative rank that we have. Well, that

21:25.180 --> 21:35.874
leads me into the next one about the vision for the 
future and what you think the College of Education

21:25.180 --> 21:35.874
will be like possibly in, I would say, year 2000 and 
beyond maybe. Where do you think we're going? I

21:40.060 --> 21:45.247
think we're going in one of two ways and we sure 
better get a handle on it. We've become so

21:45.267 --> 21:46.969
specialized And not just, now we have over here, 
but EDCI even has become specialized. We've

21:53.313 --> 21:56.718
become so specialized until we're learning more 
and more. Who was it, George Bernard Shaw, that

21:56.779 --> 22:03.228
said we learn more and more about less and less 
until we know almost everything about nothing.

22:03.248 --> 22:09.598
I'm afraid that if we aren't careful, we're headed 
exactly in that direction.

22:09.678 --> 22:17.209
It's gotten to the point where we're so 
specialized until one specialization won't talk

22:09.678 --> 22:17.209
to the other specialization or won't listen to 
another because they don't feel they know what

22:17.678 --> 22:22.184
they're talking about. I worry about that. I worry 
about it in my fields more than I do about the

22:23.866 --> 22:30.013
college because it's my business to worry about it 
right now. But our exercise physiology people,

22:30.033 --> 22:45.452
for example, are becoming so specialized in 
exercise physiology until they don't see their

22:30.033 --> 22:45.452
role as the researchers which are supposed to 
provide information for the people who are

22:30.033 --> 22:45.452
teaching the activity program to them. They see 
themselves as researchers Heaven knows what.

22:48.788 --> 22:51.590
What are we going to do with all that information? 
Publishing, maybe? Is there a lot of pressure

22:52.832 --> 22:59.418
still in your department or within the college for 
publishing and all that? Do you feel it? Because

23:00.238 --> 23:05.623
some people say it's just within and they put it on 
themselves. No.

23:10.448 --> 23:15.192
I do believe that the faculty create most of the 
pressure. not for themselves, but for one

23:15.914 --> 23:17.776
another. I think the administrators have a lot 
less, are placing a lot less pressure on faculty

23:19.818 --> 23:31.109
groups to publish than are the faculty groups 
themselves. Let me give you that example. If I have

23:34.192 --> 23:44.402
Professor A, who has a good teaching record, a 
decent publication record,

23:34.192 --> 23:44.402
I feel very strongly that If I could take Professor 
A to Dean Cargan, I can make the case that Dean

23:44.669 --> 23:53.579
Cargan would approve him, send him to the provost, 
the provost would approve him, and they'd move out

23:44.669 --> 23:53.579
on to the tenure structure. But you run that same 
professor through a faculty group, and the

23:53.979 --> 24:07.875
faculty group starts counting publications and 
starts applying all kinds of criteria to that

23:53.979 --> 24:07.875
particular person that are perceived more than 
real, I think. And consequently, my feeling is

24:08.530 --> 24:14.740
that other faculty are tougher on faculty than the 
administration is. And do you have to go through

24:14.760 --> 24:19.226
that process of other faculty before you can go on? 
Yes, yes. Through your department. That's right.

24:21.610 --> 24:27.779
However, I can make a recommendation that's 
contrary to the committee's recommendation. For

24:27.840 --> 24:35.972
example, the committee might not approve them and 
I could send them forward approved, but I also have

24:27.840 --> 24:35.972
to send forward the committee's recommendation 
at the same time. Or the committee may approve, and

24:36.492 --> 24:38.976
I could deny. But again, I have to send forward the 
committee. Does each department have complete

24:41.800 --> 24:45.846
autonomy on how they handle that tenure? Or are you 
pretty much structured? Well, you don't have

24:48.249 --> 24:53.296
complete autonomy, but you have a lot of freedom. 
You do have to have criteria spelled out, and it has

24:54.118 --> 25:02.510
to be approved by the dean, and this is where you're 
going to operate. And we look amazingly alike. to

25:06.479 --> 25:13.408
someone else we may look amazingly different but I 
think given that we look amazing. Now you started

25:13.428 --> 25:18.875
to say that we're going either one of two ways and 
one of them was the specialization and one was the

25:13.428 --> 25:18.875
other. Yeah.

25:22.440 --> 25:34.495
The other approach is for us to recognize that 
we're becoming so specialized so much so until we

25:22.440 --> 25:34.495
are losing sight of what's really important and 
finally redirect ourselves to some type

25:35.285 --> 25:52.592
of organization that makes sense, where there's 
good communication between across disciplines

25:35.285 --> 25:52.592
and specializations, and we only decide what 
we're all about. What would bring that about the

25:53.313 --> 25:55.816
best? Do you have any ideas? Gosh, if I knew that, 
Sylvia, I'd be doing it right now. And that's

26:00.624 --> 26:01.365
tough. Yes, it is. And I'm hearing that from a lot of 
people. What I'm trying to do in my department is

26:05.145 --> 26:12.674
make sure that we talk to one another, keep the 
groups meeting together and talking together.

26:12.815 --> 26:20.264
And I'm looking for some ways that we can 
collaborate our research from the exercise

26:12.815 --> 26:20.264
physiologist to the practitioner. I think the 
same thing could happen in other fields in the

26:21.585 --> 26:24.309
college. But let me give you an example. Charlie 
Shea is our motor learning instructor. And he's

26:29.926 --> 26:36.194
doing some things in the laboratory that are very 
technical and very high level. But one thing he's

26:36.334 --> 26:58.583
learned, it's almost like a spin-off, is that if 
you take, and this is going to sound very simple,

26:36.334 --> 26:58.583
but it makes an important thing, if you take a 
mallet and try to drive a peg, okay, that you have to

26:36.334 --> 26:58.583
learn how much, and you've got an electronic 
device set up so that your force is between two If

26:59.288 --> 27:01.911
you hit it too hard, you've erred. If you haven't 
hit it hard enough, you've erred. He's learned

27:05.815 --> 27:14.004
that if you have the same repeated measures in the 
same spot, you can soon learn to do that. But then

27:14.024 --> 27:19.230
when you change the parameter, you can't do it. And 
so what he's been able to demonstrate in the

27:20.031 --> 27:26.578
laboratory is that the best way to practice that 
skill is to hit it from one under one set of

27:26.862 --> 27:30.646
parameters, and then hit it for another set, and 
then another set, and then another set. In other

27:30.686 --> 27:34.390
words, vary the parameters constantly. Now, that 
has all kinds of ramifications for teaching

27:34.410 --> 27:38.214
physical education activities. And the most 
obvious one is in putting a golf ball, for example.

27:41.878 --> 27:50.408
Most people who play golf, to practice putting, 
they get a set distance, put four or five balls

27:41.878 --> 27:50.408
down, and put the same stroke, same distance. His 
research says that's not a very productive way of

27:50.748 --> 27:54.372
learning the skill. You'd be better off putting it 
from one distance, then another distance, and

27:54.672 --> 27:59.036
then a third distance, and so forth. Well, now, why 
not take what he's found in the laboratory? Now,

28:02.939 --> 28:06.402
he's demonstrated it in the laboratory, but it 
hasn't been demonstrated in the field. But we have

28:07.063 --> 28:13.248
some people teaching activity courses in the 
field who could very easily conduct that research

28:07.063 --> 28:13.248
under his guidance. He sets up the parameters. 
They'd be the technician, collect the data. The

28:17.072 --> 28:19.694
two of them together write it in. And then you're 
building a camaraderie between the two that Well,

28:23.545 --> 28:32.437
and also the fact that you have this laboratory and 
that you make it available to people and people

28:23.545 --> 28:32.437
come in and get this test, or at least I think you do, 
I know you did. Sure, yeah. Isn't that an excellent

28:33.599 --> 28:35.361
way of... I think so. And are people taking 
advantage of that to any extent? They are. To a

28:40.108 --> 28:45.315
large extent, not to the extent that we allow for 
them to, but to a large extent. I think the thing

28:45.355 --> 28:49.941
that Dean Cargill tried to set up with the 
independent school districts last year is a step

28:50.326 --> 28:51.387
in that direction. You know, health, wellness 
weekend type things? Well, no, I was referring to a

28:53.449 --> 29:04.762
meeting we had in the Woodlands, I believe, in 
which we brought in researchers from the public

28:53.449 --> 29:04.762
schools to interface with researchers from 
higher education on the idea of making theirs

28:53.449 --> 29:04.762
available. Yeah, it's still in progress, isn't 
it? I understand there was, I think, Chris Foreman

29:06.444 --> 29:09.988
was in San Antonio for a meeting on that last week. 
Good. I think that's a step toward building that

29:10.728 --> 29:19.438
camaraderie, keeping you focused on what you're 
all about rather than getting information just

29:10.728 --> 29:19.438
for information's sake. Can we talk just for a few 
minutes about highlights and things that you

29:20.026 --> 29:35.647
feel, and there's a little reluctance in people 
talking about their own contribution, but what

29:20.026 --> 29:35.647
are some of the things that you feel have been most 
meaningful since you have been here? And does

29:35.667 --> 29:37.369
anything stand out in particular? I know there's 
been lots of things over such a long time. I think

29:39.692 --> 29:45.160
there's, this is difficult, but there's two or 
three things that have happened. Now, whether I

29:45.180 --> 29:48.685
had anything to do with them, I was around when it 
happened. One is we were able to get much improved

29:50.131 --> 29:54.677
facilities over what we had. A lot of people 
contributed to that. And I happened to be the one

29:59.324 --> 30:07.735
that came along at the right time to organize the 
move and finalize the building. But Dr. Landis,

30:07.855 --> 30:13.904
who was probably ahead of me, had worked a long time 
to get us in that position. But I think that made a

30:13.924 --> 30:19.311
lot of difference in our program is better 
facilities. I think another thing that has

30:20.236 --> 30:33.809
happened that I was involved in was the, this is 
going to sound contradictory, considering what I

30:20.236 --> 30:33.809
just said, but the splitting away of health 
education and physical education. And that

30:33.829 --> 30:37.212
happened in this department in the 70s, 74, 75. And 
I think I had something to do with that, along with

30:37.233 --> 30:44.480
Dr. Hurley, who was on our staff. Until that time, 
the program was a health and physical education

30:45.701 --> 30:50.125
curriculum. In other words, someone going 
through that curriculum was certified to teach

30:50.763 --> 30:57.636
not just physical education, but also health 
education. But what was happening was you were

30:57.656 --> 31:06.393
prepared to teach physical education, and you had 
six hours of health, for example, which didn't

30:57.656 --> 31:06.393
prepare you to teach health at all. And by 
splitting that apart, I think we now have strong

31:07.134 --> 31:14.087
discipline in physical education and strong 
discipline in health education. Is health

31:14.742 --> 31:17.507
education still a requirement in the public 
school? Yes. And physical ed, I know. That's

31:19.932 --> 31:20.393
right. At the secondary level of health, we've 
lost some of the requirements at the junior high

31:20.413 --> 31:26.586
level. And at the elementary level, it's in the 
hands of the self-contained classroom teacher.

31:32.495 --> 31:38.402
Do you have any follow-up system for your students 
and how many go into actual teaching and how many

31:32.495 --> 31:38.402
stay? I'm hearing a lot about the retention and how 
a lot of people are not staying in the profession

31:38.422 --> 31:44.669
and we're spending a lot of money to educate. Do you 
have a feel for that? I don't have a feel for it, but

31:46.511 --> 31:50.675
I've got the system in place to get the feel. We're 
in the process right now. About four years ago, we

31:52.618 --> 32:01.928
established a feedback procedure in which we 
administer questionnaires to our graduates and

31:52.618 --> 32:01.928
then A year later, we follow up with them. Two years 
later, we follow up with them. And then five years

32:06.908 --> 32:09.253
later, we follow up with them. And that data is 
coming in, and it has not been analyzed. But we

32:13.844 --> 32:16.170
should be able to have some data.
