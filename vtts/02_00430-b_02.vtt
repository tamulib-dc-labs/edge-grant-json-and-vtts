WEBVTT

00:02.039 --> 00:07.109
What different battles did you, during the Tet, 
when were you wounded during what year? Right at

00:07.129 --> 00:09.453
the heart of the Tet event. And, well, I was wounded 
twice. I was wounded in 65. You know, I stepped on

00:13.782 --> 00:16.587
that mine and I was paralyzed for 10 months. And I 
declared never to walk again, but I did, you know,

00:17.790 --> 00:21.998
because of faith. Because of determination, and 
that's why I'm I tell these youngsters in schools

00:24.837 --> 00:28.001
when I go. I spoke to Texas A&M. Did you know about 
that? Yeah, he said he thought that you had been on

00:30.684 --> 00:33.467
campus. I spoke to those Aggies. In fact, they were 
getting me mad because I didn't know of the way that

00:36.530 --> 00:44.499
they have a way of approving and disapproving of 
your remarks. And I was getting that whoop, whoop,

00:44.600 --> 00:46.922
whoop, whoop. And I thought they were making fun of 
me. You didn't know that the Aggie whoop, whoop

00:49.826 --> 00:53.570
meant that it was good, huh? That's right. And 
especially, I got a real whoop-whoop when I said,

00:54.959 --> 01:09.813
one of the song micromanagers who was a graduate of 
Texas A&M, of A&M,

00:54.959 --> 01:09.813
that I learned two things. Either to follow, 
leave, or drink beer and get the hell out of the way.

01:15.858 --> 01:18.040
He said, whoop-whoop, whoop-whoop, whoop. No,

01:18.060 --> 01:23.245
I don't know what... about the question that you 
asked? When you were wounded? When I was wounded?

01:32.417 --> 01:33.858
Okay. I didn't know. I was completely sorry in 
1965. I never find out anything. I'm supposed to

01:41.926 --> 01:47.511
meet a guy that's 20 years in San Antonio, Texas, 
who said I saved his life. I don't know how I saved

01:49.392 --> 01:52.455
his life, because I don't remember. I woke up in the 
Philippine Islands in Glock Air Force Base. And I

01:58.038 --> 02:00.321
was paralyzed. And I brought myself together. I 
used to stand up. Did you see that show that I did for

02:04.547 --> 02:07.030
real people? No, I didn't get to see that. Yeah, it 
showed, you know, at the 100th grade. I'd drop out

02:11.857 --> 02:21.531
of bed and crawl up to the wall and back myself and 
pick up myself and stand there and try to move my

02:11.857 --> 02:21.531
toes. And I did that for 10 months, boy. Sometimes 
the nurses would catch me, you know, and they'd

02:25.073 --> 02:33.386
give me a pill and a shot and put me

02:25.073 --> 02:33.386
to sleep. But the doctor said that I never walked 
again. And I walked out of the hospital. Thank God I

02:40.397 --> 02:42.260
did. I went back in 68. I volunteered. I made three 
pressure jumps in one day after I got out of the

02:44.303 --> 02:48.430
hospital. I brought myself physically in.

02:55.901 --> 02:59.545
You know, it's willpower that a person should 
have. That's why I tell these youngsters, you

03:00.386 --> 03:05.913
know, there's faith. And I ask them, what are the 
very first words that you utter when you need help?

03:09.378 --> 03:10.099
Oh my God. And that's you. If you want something 
done, you'll find a way. I was taught in the schools

03:17.924 --> 03:26.194
and in the Army, especially in the Air Force, that 
quitters never win and winners never quit. So I'm a

03:27.656 --> 03:31.000
winner.

03:31.020 --> 03:45.737
And in that show of real people, I was speaking at a 
school,

03:31.020 --> 03:45.737
and a little girl came in and asked a question as to, 
you know, after I'd been shot up six, seven times

03:31.020 --> 03:45.737
and band-aids and so forth, I thought about giving 
up. And I told her, I said, no, honey, I said, don't

03:51.021 --> 03:55.085
marry, don't never give up. I mean, that's just the 
way I feel. You know, you fight the last drop. I

03:59.829 --> 04:01.831
mean, that enemy is just like you. You're better 
training him, so it's you or him.

04:10.299 --> 04:13.362
Then in 68, then I went back. Uh, that, uh, Dan Masek 
was one of the volunteers to go get those, those men

04:14.320 --> 04:19.927
out.

04:22.930 --> 04:26.134
It was a, it was a trip of no return. And because the 
whole darn mission was already, it's, it was a

04:26.154 --> 04:33.243
highly classified mission. And there was no 
return in any company. They shut off the

04:36.687 --> 04:39.230
operation. But those poor guys, they needed help. 
And I'm glad that the other helicopter that came

04:41.827 --> 04:47.654
over to my area didn't know about that. There was no 
other helicopter before that. Which eventually

04:50.278 --> 04:56.806
they went later.

04:56.826 --> 04:58.267
Maybe we could have saved some more. What unit were 
you with? I was the Taxman B-56 Sigma of the 5th

05:02.152 --> 05:09.201
Special Forces. We were in the Intelligence 
Reconference Team. We were trained to gather

05:15.499 --> 05:29.397
information from the enemy, the size, the 
location,

05:15.499 --> 05:29.397
and the morale. We went on some long, lonely 
missions at times, away behind lines. And we got

05:36.347 --> 05:38.209
pretty good information. That was during the, 
there was more of that. But see, it's what really

05:42.172 --> 05:57.494
gets me that they're only

05:42.172 --> 05:57.494
questioning those that were right there on the 
staff. They're not questioning the people that

05:57.514 --> 06:03.101
were feeding the information

05:57.514 --> 06:03.101
to them. Those are the men that know. I mean, 
whether one of these men back over here on the staff

06:11.483 --> 06:15.447
Well, had it in for the general and he would make it 
up and no one knows. No one knows. False

06:18.549 --> 06:19.570
information. He had no way of knowing whether the 
information was true or not. That's right. He just

06:24.054 --> 06:39.668
had to go, he had to depend on the people under him 
to... Well, you see that plaque that I have and

06:24.054 --> 06:39.668
that's what, that's what that commentator, that 
plaque of West Point that I have right under the

06:24.054 --> 06:39.668
president now, uh, uh, One of the commentators, 
reporters in that CBS network, when the general

06:40.373 --> 06:57.934
got very disappointed, and he got a little bit 
disturbed when he said that his integrity had been

06:40.373 --> 06:57.934
insulted. And that reporter reminded the general 
of the code of West Point Census. The general was a

07:07.606 --> 07:09.368
West Point graduate. And the code, duty, honor, 
and country. A cadet does not lie, cheat, or steal,

07:14.001 --> 07:18.027
or tolerate those that do. Now that, to me, I was 
trained by Westmoreland. I had commanders, and I

07:24.616 --> 07:27.681
lived by that code also.

07:30.966 --> 07:36.794
Anyone that comes next, they don't know what 
they're

07:30.966 --> 07:36.794
talking about. I hope he wins the case. But my 
question is, how come we're not interviewed? Us

07:42.423 --> 07:46.647
that were gathering intelligence and 
information. They have just as much top secret

07:46.667 --> 07:49.169
plans as we have.

07:52.151 --> 07:58.797
But I bet you if they would, then they'd really know 
the truth.

07:58.997 --> 08:01.820
They're going to be very selective on who they 
interview. Well, probably so. Probably.

08:10.064 --> 08:25.763
It's one thing that we have, that some 
professionals have, that we're not out to glorify

08:10.064 --> 08:25.763
ourselves when we come into contact with you. 
We're out to help one another.

08:31.409 --> 08:34.893
I mean, if I'm asked, did you do this, did you do 
that? Yes, I did. I'm not going to say that he

08:36.896 --> 08:38.738
ordered me. Because maybe in his staff meetings, 
he wasn't told exactly everything, the way things

08:41.249 --> 08:49.018
were going back then.

08:53.923 --> 09:02.493
You said that you attended the Memorial Day 
services in Washington when they unveiled the new

08:53.923 --> 09:02.493
monument and everything. Do you think that it's a 
worthy monument to the Vietnam veterans? I think

09:08.400 --> 09:11.003
it is. It is a symbol of gratitude. I think that the 
public

09:18.816 --> 09:29.809
that goes there sense that thoughtfulness. And in 
a way, they're trying to, well, we put it on

09:30.850 --> 09:35.736
ourselves. We work for it ourselves. We just want 
to show the public, hey, We're doing this for our

09:41.442 --> 09:43.926
own self. I mean, you neglected it now. But now they 
want to, you should have seen it, I tell you, there

09:46.970 --> 09:53.039
in those restaurants and those bars. Even the cab 
drivers would give them a free ride. Because they

09:57.305 --> 10:04.335
knew, they knew the way the others were treated 
there. And there's people that go there and they

10:04.355 --> 10:09.542
take pictures that people would just stand there 
with tears in their eyes. Whether they had a son

10:14.596 --> 10:27.287
that died in Vietnam or not, but the kid next door, 
the guy that lived with, that little boy, just like

10:14.596 --> 10:27.287
John that lives across from us, you know, we love 
that little kid. Not only because he's the only son

10:27.307 --> 10:33.533
in the family, but he comes, you know, and we move 
here. He comes to stay with us, he comes to eat here,

10:33.553 --> 10:36.836
and everything. And, uh, I won't say too much about 
the other name. Do you think it's significant on

10:44.651 --> 10:50.379
the monument that it has a black man? No, I don't 
think it's that much. I think it's just that they,

10:52.823 --> 10:58.151
you know, we got what we wanted and we just wanted to 
put that. I mean, we could have put a woman there.

10:59.713 --> 11:00.695
You know, they'd serve too. And probably they're 
trying to come up with the idea. But what, are we

11:04.501 --> 11:06.924
going to put three women there too? Because if 
three women serve,

11:11.403 --> 11:39.503
Well, when I saw it on TV,

11:11.403 --> 11:39.503
you know, to me,

11:11.403 --> 11:39.503
I thought, well, you know, It's really good that 
there's the white man, the black man, and the brown

11:39.905 --> 11:53.644
man, showing that it wasn't just one person 
fighting the war, that it was a unified thing

11:39.905 --> 11:53.644
between all the races. It's like the stamp. Did you 
see the Hispanic stamp? No. That's been an honor

11:58.690 --> 12:04.258
for them, and the honor was different.

12:08.390 --> 12:14.219
When did you, so you left Vietnam in, in 68 after you 
were wounded. And they, where did you go after

12:14.239 --> 12:16.662
that? Well, I came, well, I came to three 
hospitals. I came through Japan, and I came

12:21.390 --> 12:34.429
through California, and I landed in, in Fort 
Tampines, in the region of Virginia, in San

12:21.390 --> 12:34.429
Antonio. How long were you in the hospital? All 
total, from the time I got hit and then to about the

12:36.959 --> 12:47.192
time that I was released, I was over a year. Where 
was your family at this time? They were here in El

12:50.317 --> 12:51.418
Campo. And when were you, when did you, after that, 
did you, were you still in the service? When did

12:56.645 --> 12:58.708
you, were you discharged from the service? No, I 
continue, you know, I got rehabilitated and I got,

12:58.728 --> 13:05.937
you know, thanks to the modern technology and 
doctors, good doctors.

13:12.006 --> 13:15.572
I was allowed to remain in the military. I couldn't 
jump anymore out of airplanes and I couldn't be in

13:15.592 --> 13:24.085
the special forces anymore. However, I did try. 
When I was released, I was sent to...

13:33.710 --> 13:38.899
I went to Fort Deven, Massachusetts with the 10 
Special Forces group. And that group there does

13:38.919 --> 13:46.952
some mountain training, mountain climbing, 
skiing. Every group in the Special Forces has a

13:48.415 --> 13:55.667
different area of training and expertise. Well, 
they're all trained in light and heavy weapons,

13:56.153 --> 14:06.644
engineering, mechanics, in operation 
intelligence, and communication. But the

14:06.984 --> 14:13.050
different areas of the country, of the world, 
they're trained for those different parts. They

14:13.070 --> 14:20.437
have a responsibility for parts of the world. And I 
was there. And then I found out I just couldn't jump

14:22.833 --> 14:27.618
anymore, and it hurt me. It hurt myself. So I was 
sent to Fort Ryder, Kansas. And I was given a death

14:33.765 --> 14:35.948
jab, which I hated. But still, you know, I was in the 
troop. And I went to Europe on the Reef Hoarder

14:39.632 --> 14:44.137
exercise for seven weeks. I loved it. I really got 
out to the field. Sometimes my commander, you

14:47.161 --> 14:50.224
know, he'd get mad a little bit. But I wanted to be 
with the troops, you know, because I was a field

14:50.862 --> 14:55.268
soldier. And I returned back. I went, I stayed 
there two years in Kansas. And then I was assigned

15:00.915 --> 15:04.680
to drive for a general, a commander. And then I was 
transferred to Fort St.

15:06.302 --> 15:15.053
Houston. How long were you in Fort St. Houston? 
Well, I was there, I think, four years. And until

15:20.596 --> 15:35.619
the general retired, and then I was given another 
assignment, which I persuaded them into letting

15:20.596 --> 15:35.619
me be an advisor to the reserve unit so I could be out 
and do the troops. And they had special forces

15:35.639 --> 15:40.527
reserves, you know. So, you know, they thought 
that, they didn't know the full extent of my

15:41.789 --> 15:45.895
health. I wasn't about to tell them any time. I'd 
rather hurt than be out there in the field, you

15:48.700 --> 15:57.571
know, than to be behind a desk, listening to 
telephones and everything. And then my injuries

15:57.631 --> 16:04.660
started catching up with me naturally as I was 
getting older. And there were some bad times that,

16:04.680 --> 16:12.950
you know, that I shouldn't really be enough to the 
field and exaggerate the training. So I had to go

16:13.190 --> 16:14.532
on. important, you know, get a physical. And at 
times, the doctor, you know, he would tell me to

16:19.855 --> 16:29.384
say, that's it, you know, you're wasting yourself 
just because of the pride that you have of being a

16:19.855 --> 16:29.384
Green Maria. Well, you know, either to or die. But I 
was boarded out. Five doctors came to a conclusion

16:36.432 --> 16:43.759
at eight. You're not fit for military duty. Let's 
face it. It's not that you can't do it. It's just

16:49.598 --> 16:53.502
that you can't do it by regulation. So I thought 
that if these five doctors had concluded that,

16:55.423 --> 17:10.578
then why should I be putting a senior 
non-commissioned officer corps in the chamber?

17:10.598 --> 17:14.522
Because when I was leading the troops, naturally, 
I had to set the example. And you can't set no

17:15.903 --> 17:23.631
example by walking crippled or sitting down and 
letting the troops go by. You have to be the first

17:23.651 --> 17:29.778
one up front and you have to be with them early in the 
morning. You can't slow down. You're sending a bad

17:31.880 --> 17:32.941
example. So I had to accept that I did. So after 25 
years I said, hey, we're going to magically

17:39.769 --> 17:45.775
discharge you because they did. In what year was 
that? 1976. 1976. When did you find, when did you

17:52.609 --> 18:11.779
begin your, or find out about the Medal of Honor and 
start your... Well, I knew, I knew, I found out

17:52.609 --> 18:11.779
about that in, in 70, 73, when I was there in San 
Antonio before San Houston. I met a an officer that

18:13.615 --> 18:22.407
I had served with, my commander, and he knew of my 
action. He was an intelligence officer. And we had

18:25.332 --> 18:31.180
coffee one day, and he asked me about the medley. I 
said, well, I didn't know nothing about it. My

18:33.724 --> 18:40.012
commander thought I was dead, and everybody 
thought I was dead, all but him when he saw me there.

18:40.033 --> 18:43.217
And then we, that was in the 70s, We started the ball 
rolling, and we dug up the original

18:43.957 --> 19:02.439
recommendation, and they stated, you know, the 
Malabano was recommended, but an internal war was

18:43.957 --> 19:02.439
made.

19:02.459 --> 19:05.443
And so, we had to start from scratch. We had to find 
the commander again. We found Colonel Drake. We

19:09.588 --> 19:10.870
found him in Louisiana. And... Well, you know, of 
course, I drove down there to see him, and that was a

19:14.635 --> 19:21.865
moment I tell you. In fact, he said that he wanted to 
take a picture that embraced him. He said he never

19:28.755 --> 19:32.080
embraced his wife like that. Of course, we were 
happy to see each other, you know. And the last

19:34.163 --> 19:37.328
piece on was, I was floating in my own blood. And I 
couldn't talk to him. I could just wiggle my toes.

19:43.998 --> 19:45.239
Then he reconstructed. He didn't know the full 
extent of mine, actually. He didn't know that I had

19:50.784 --> 19:56.469
volunteered

19:50.784 --> 19:56.469
to go. Then he reconstructed me. How long? And then 
I had to find witnesses. And I found an eyewitness.

20:08.779 --> 20:13.043
It took me from 73 to 81.

20:13.158 --> 20:18.266
You were awarded the, in that 1981 is when you were 
awarded the medal. Yeah. See, but it started from

20:18.426 --> 20:20.769
May of 68. You just laid dormant all those years, 
and you didn't know anything about it. Yeah, well,

20:27.119 --> 20:31.466
you see, that's why the people in the surrounding 
area came. They thought that I was asking for the

20:31.486 --> 20:35.091
medal. I just wanted to widen it, to dig up the 
record, and I need it. Moral support, and I needed

20:39.517 --> 20:44.623
it from the veterans organization.

20:46.326 --> 20:59.502
One organization said, and this was a very highly 
publicized veteran organization, and said, hey,

20:46.326 --> 20:59.502
we're not supposed to get involved with the 
ex-serviceman in the war. Well, golly. And the

21:01.605 --> 21:08.173
veterans organization, well, because this is 
local, they didn't want it. Had my name been Jones

21:09.301 --> 21:16.910
or Mitchell, it would have been different.

21:17.551 --> 21:23.858
Even though there's supposed to be no prejudice, 
there's still a lot of prejudice, isn't there? A

21:24.118 --> 21:24.979
lot of jealousy. Jealousy. You have to consider 
the sources. But it's hard. It's hard. It's hard

21:32.548 --> 21:37.294
for me and my kid, because he goes through the peer 
pressure. I mean, what am I supposed to do? get up

21:39.018 --> 21:39.759
and leave. One of my neighbors, the kids, they can 
play together, but they can't step in her yard. And

21:49.468 --> 21:52.250
yet her kids can run across my yard any time.

21:58.195 --> 22:06.443
It's a shame that people have these jealousies and 
can't just accept everybody as they are.

22:18.505 --> 22:23.311
What effects do you think of the separation from 
your family? Did you, do you think there was any

22:24.152 --> 22:31.100
problems being separated from your family so long 
being in the service? Do you think it's hard on, on

22:31.120 --> 22:36.987
wives and children to be dependents of 
servicemen? Well, yeah, but see my wife, my wife

22:37.007 --> 22:46.858
knew that I, my career, of course we, we got, we were 
married when I began my career. And I had told her,

22:47.378 --> 22:53.406
you know, I had explained to her, this is my life, 
this is my career. You marry in the Army, you're not

22:53.426 --> 22:56.570
married to me. So, you know, she accepted it, 
because I had sit down and talked this over, you

22:56.590 --> 23:06.723
know, friends we're gonna meet, places we're 
gonna travel to, and everything. And before you,

23:08.806 --> 23:16.035
whatever, you can say no, or you can say yes. 
There's no other work that I can do better than to be

23:16.302 --> 23:21.455
a soldier. And I've learned a lot of skills. That's 
why I tell the youngsters in school, I've learned a

23:23.580 --> 23:29.675
lot of good traits. And I got my education in the 
military. Not only traveling, but I started my

23:33.768 --> 23:37.132
college education. I got my high school diploma. I 
went to an MP school. I was an investigator. I was an

23:43.360 --> 23:45.523
interpreter. I am an interrogator. I know 
fingerprint. I know meteorology. I know chemical

23:51.190 --> 23:55.917
warfare techniques.

23:55.937 --> 23:57.058
I know foreign languages. I could have never done 
nothing out here. I'd have to pay for it. The

24:03.794 --> 24:06.437
military paid for it. I traveled at the expense of 
the taxpayers' money. And I served my country. I

24:12.124 --> 24:13.446
traveled all over the world. So, yes, they had some 
sort of hardship, but then they understood. And

24:21.436 --> 24:26.082
we've been back for 26 years now. What hardship 
there was, I don't know. At times I felt bad, yes.

24:32.066 --> 24:35.910
But still, you know, she stayed behind me and I'm 
glad. There's some broken marriages because they

24:37.492 --> 24:42.257
don't talk things and they don't want to. And maybe 
it's best. Maybe it's best to

24:44.780 --> 24:50.486
separate. But there's some people that are cut out 
for certain jobs and that's it. And everybody

24:55.631 --> 24:57.133
agrees on it. And you don't fight the system. It

25:00.374 --> 25:10.405
just happened that I got severely wounded, and the 
Army takes care of the military. This government

25:11.446 --> 25:15.270
takes care of the veterans. And so I'm happy to take 
care of it. How do you spend your time now? What is

25:21.757 --> 25:27.863
your main objective as far as working with the 
military or in any space that you can? Oh, well, I,

25:28.079 --> 25:47.080
you know, I'm called to come and make speeches to 
various colleges and schools, ROTC's, and I'm

25:28.079 --> 25:47.080
writing my autobiography, you know, I have a 
Pulitzer Prize winner that goes right. And I just

25:47.100 --> 25:54.188
enjoy my kids, you know, we stay together and we 
travel. Just like, you know, the retired person.

25:58.195 --> 26:07.107
But I like to, I don't like to, but I do go visit 
patients in the hospital, you know, veterans. I

26:07.368 --> 26:13.056
hate to see them there because I remember my days, 
you know, there. And I know what they're going

26:13.076 --> 26:17.322
through. I know that some of these doctors, 
there's nothing they can do for them. And I know

26:23.450 --> 26:24.732
some of these Others, they're members of the 
family, they want everything done overnight. I

26:31.741 --> 26:40.774
know some of these veterans, they're killed, 
they've been neglected

26:31.741 --> 26:40.774
through their benefits. And so, they called on me 
to help them. I had friends all over the country

26:45.561 --> 26:53.031
that advised me, lawyers and what not. And I'd get 
someone and say, oh, women widows. There's a lady

26:56.549 --> 26:59.332
that's having problems. She works at the bank. 
She's having problems with her husband. Her

27:06.261 --> 27:12.969
husband, her brother-in-law, her husband's 
brother and I were in the service together. And I

27:13.169 --> 27:17.314
walked in the bank one day, and I noticed a name. And 
we talked. We got acquainted. And she said, yeah,

27:20.766 --> 27:23.230
I've heard a lot about you. That my brother-in-law 
used to talk about you. And so she asked me if I heard

27:28.277 --> 27:30.921
about it. So I told her, I think she went to the 
proper authorities. And you also said that you

27:38.759 --> 27:42.463
that's something that's really important to you, 
is working with the POW and the MIA. Yes, I'm

27:42.843 --> 27:44.485
involved with them. In fact, I happened to write a 
letter to a guy in Anchorage, Alaska, that they

27:44.505 --> 27:56.057
want to get involved with a mine of bracelet, and he 
wants to set up a little program up there for the

27:44.505 --> 27:56.057
MIA. There's a lady here in Palacios that I want to 
go see. Her son's been

28:00.081 --> 28:07.348
missing since 1959, I think. She doesn't know, you 
know, she's a Hispanic lady. She doesn't know the

28:09.926 --> 28:15.613
benefits, the rights that she had with her mother. 
And so I'm going to go in here and advise on that. I,

28:18.677 --> 28:35.940
uh, I hope that, that, uh, you know, these, these, 
uh, students who get involved, uh, to help, uh, to

28:18.677 --> 28:35.940
call the right, uh, the, uh, government, North 
American government. I mean, what? What? Why are

28:37.248 --> 28:40.571
we holding on to this? These youngsters, just 
think, it's going to be Christmas. How do you think

28:45.436 --> 28:48.799
some of these youngsters, they never knew their 
dad. They were too little, they'd never seen him.

28:51.962 --> 29:05.736
How can they be watching TV, singing Christmas 
carols and enjoying themselves when things would

28:51.962 --> 29:05.736
come to their mind about their dad sitting over 
there in some little wooden cage? not knowing what

29:06.695 --> 29:12.924
day it is, and not even good about it. How many MIAs 
do they, POWs do they think are still over there?

29:18.031 --> 29:25.642
The last count that we had, there was 2,992, I 
think. POWs? Yeah. I know there's 164 in Texas.

29:31.931 --> 29:33.073
I've got all their names. There are 16 Hispanic, 19 
Hispanic.

29:48.156 --> 29:54.665
Well, I'd like to thank you for sharing your life 
and story with us. Thank you. I hope you make an A.

29:56.628 --> 30:00.293
And I've certainly enjoyed seeing all your posts. 
beautiful things you have. I've got some more

30:04.331 --> 30:05.658
since the last time. See that big Indian right 
there? Yeah. That guy here with Chicago and the

30:08.192 --> 30:09.439
North.
