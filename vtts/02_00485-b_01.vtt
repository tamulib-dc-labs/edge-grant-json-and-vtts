WEBVTT

00:01.432 --> 00:05.939
Oh, it was just so cold. After a while, one gets to 
where they can only think about one thing, and

00:06.960 --> 00:18.256
that's getting on the ground.

00:19.598 --> 00:21.601
Just to get on the ground, you'd fly into it.

00:27.029 --> 00:28.992
It was that kind of an approach.

00:33.325 --> 00:39.613
for me and I damn near

00:33.325 --> 00:39.613
wiped it out hitting the ground. And with so cold it 
wouldn't have even cared. There was no heater

00:44.520 --> 00:46.903
units at all in the plane? No, there was no heat in 
airplanes at those days.

00:53.833 --> 00:57.117
Even if, you know, there was in a couple of them. But 
it wasn't effective enough. You just had to wear

00:59.280 --> 01:01.543
enough clothes. to keep yourself warm, and that's 
impossible when you're at those kind of altitudes

01:02.182 --> 01:10.632
and that kind of weather. You just can't do it.

01:15.478 --> 01:22.306
It

01:15.478 --> 01:22.306
can get cold enough that you don't care, no matter 
what it is. You just don't care. Did you crash on

01:24.308 --> 01:26.110
this landing? No, I got by with it all right. We had 
others, and it didn't happen to me, but we had

01:31.139 --> 01:41.390
others that would come in there and at other 
places, and it would be so cold they couldn't get

01:31.139 --> 01:41.390
out of the cockpit and sail them back. Really? You 
could run a lift over there. It didn't have

01:47.016 --> 01:53.703
forklifts as such at that time, but it's like a 
forklift. You lift them up and take them inside.

01:59.354 --> 02:06.741
put them in a cloth of ice and warm them up. That's 
painful. That didn't happen to me. You flew the

02:14.881 --> 02:17.806
mail for about two and a half months then in 1934? 
Yes, my unit did. I wasn't just by myself. Of course

02:21.653 --> 02:23.536
not. My unit was involved in the mail. And then what 
did you do? Well, this was the 11th Bombardment

02:27.482 --> 02:35.115
Squadron of the 7th Bomb Group when it was 
stationed at Marsh Field, California. And when we

02:35.872 --> 02:49.886
got over the airmail, we were receiving our new 
airplanes, the Martin B-10s, which was probably

02:35.872 --> 02:49.886
the greatest, biggest, fastest airplane in the 
world at that time. And so we started immediately

02:49.906 --> 03:05.541
training

02:49.906 --> 03:05.541
and developing this as a bombardment airplane and 
squadron and group and strategy. spent our time

03:06.854 --> 03:33.840
learning how to use this airplane, how to bomb with 
it, how to navigate with it, how to fight with it,

03:06.854 --> 03:33.840
how to avoid the pursuit aircraft and this was the 
only time in history up to that time that the bomber

03:06.854 --> 03:33.840
was faster than the fighter, so we had fun. We could 
thumb our nose at them and go off and leave them at

03:34.630 --> 03:44.183
25, 30,000 feet and go on and bomb our target and 
come home and get away from them. We had a bunch of

03:44.203 --> 03:49.029
frustrated pursuers, I thought, all day. And we 
developed the tactics for bombardment that were

03:49.049 --> 03:59.744
used on

03:49.049 --> 03:59.744
into World War II. Had to be modified some, but They 
were used over Germany during the war. And what

04:06.966 --> 04:08.167
were those tactics? Well, it's a method of attack.

04:16.217 --> 04:20.323
They would fill several volumes of the book. It's a 
method of

04:20.423 --> 04:31.637
getting to your target, getting onto it. and 
delivering your load and getting away. And there

04:36.900 --> 04:41.304
are many, many variations of it, but we worked it 
out. Taking off from fields out with no lights,

04:43.526 --> 05:00.983
navigating to the target with no lights, turning 
in and attacking the target from various

04:43.526 --> 05:00.983
altitudes at 10 second intervals.

05:01.705 --> 05:04.450
and leaving by separate routes in the dark. All 
this sounds like not very much, but it puts the heat

05:06.794 --> 05:23.083
on everybody, I'll tell you, when you've got six or 
eight hundred airplanes up in an area of various

05:06.794 --> 05:23.083
altitudes going various places. You have to be a 
little bit careful with that. to be on time. And of

05:28.704 --> 05:30.646
course, this is still during the Depression. With 
the B-10 now, did you get, this is a new airplane,

05:31.267 --> 05:36.933
did you get a lot more new equipment? Yes. As 
equipment went, we did. New radios and other

05:43.039 --> 05:53.430
things like that, although in terms of today's 
equipment, why, it's really insignificant. But

05:53.450 --> 05:55.472
as of then, yes, we did. Well, we didn't get a lot of 
them. We only had one group, for example. The

05:59.976 --> 06:05.761
United States Air Force at that time, well, there 
should have been 10 or 12 or 15 groups.

06:08.763 --> 06:15.169
But with the one that we had, well, we really did do 
it. And how many planes and pilots did you have in a

06:15.189 --> 06:18.812
group? Well, a group at that time was three 
squadrons. Each squadron was twenty-four

06:25.304 --> 06:27.667
airplanes.

06:29.349 --> 06:44.649
You'd have usually thirty-six pilots, 
twenty-four airplanes, and other things that go

06:29.349 --> 06:44.649
with

06:29.349 --> 06:44.649
them. That was during this period of time that the 
Macon went down off of West Coast. We were having

06:55.882 --> 07:09.096
terrible problems with the Navy in terms of

06:55.882 --> 07:09.096
whether we could fly and fight over the sea or not. 
That seemed kind of like a ridiculous thing in

07:10.578 --> 07:17.686
retrospect, but it was deadly serious at that 
time. And the winner of winning or losing the

07:17.706 --> 07:21.450
argument made told the story as to whether you got 
any money or not. So it was a real lot of bitter

07:28.949 --> 07:31.812
fights. And I was involved in nearly all of those 
missions that

07:32.894 --> 07:42.566
we had Navy problems with. That was also part of the 
development. Most of them off the west coast of

07:44.429 --> 07:45.931
California, then. Yes. Yes. Right. And so at this 
time there was a heck of a lot of inter-service

07:51.940 --> 07:55.344
rivalry. Yes, particularly between Air Force and 
Navy. There wasn't so much other rivalry at that

07:58.288 --> 08:01.052
time. The Air Force and Navy was real, real serious 
rivalry. And how successful were you bombing out

08:05.758 --> 08:08.081
at sea? Very. Especially with the new B-10s. Yes, 
well the B-10s we could reach out, you see. a

08:20.746 --> 08:23.851
significant distance. Three and four hundred 
miles offshore.

08:44.422 --> 08:55.836
I was just thinking on one of the first missions we 
went out and intercepted the Army transport Megs

08:44.422 --> 08:55.836
that was on its way in from the Philippines.

08:58.599 --> 09:07.290
And since we couldn't bomb the Megs, obviously, 
one of our planes went down and dropped an aluminum

08:58.599 --> 09:07.290
slick. It was just a bag that had some aluminum 
powder in it, hit on the water and make a slick

09:08.890 --> 09:15.222
circle that you can see. And we bombed that and went 
on back. Before we landed back at Hamilton, that's

09:20.773 --> 09:25.482
where we were operating from at that time. The Navy 
had already reported the thing to the Secretary of

09:27.470 --> 09:42.649
War and they had word there for the commander to 
report to Washington before he even got back on the

09:27.470 --> 09:42.649
ground again from the mission.

09:42.669 --> 09:47.816
So they were dead serious about it.

09:47.836 --> 09:54.304
Now when did the amount of inter-service rivalry 
start to decline between the Air Corps and the

09:47.836 --> 09:54.304
Navy? Well, I think it built right on from there. 
Well, it didn't start there, but it kept right on

10:01.679 --> 10:22.131
building

10:01.679 --> 10:22.131
until it finally culminated or peaked, I guess, in 
the B-36 argument in Washington in about 48, I

10:01.679 --> 10:22.131
believe it was, 48, 49.

10:24.507 --> 10:41.986
But the thing that finally stopped it, not stopped 
it, but made it entirely different was the fact

10:24.507 --> 10:41.986
that

10:24.507 --> 10:41.986
the missile obviously came in and it was going to 
take over and dominate everything. And it would be

10:42.046 --> 10:47.232
used by all three services, depending upon their 
uses for it. And it was so damned expensive that

10:48.353 --> 10:53.198
each of the service was going to have problems 
enough Just funding the one that they had to have,

10:53.937 --> 10:57.825
not the ones they liked to have. So I think that 
ended it pretty much. And how long did you stay out

11:03.918 --> 11:09.009
in California training here? It says that you went 
down to the canals on this one. Well, I was in

11:11.437 --> 11:20.709
California from February of 34 when we got there to 
Marshfield and then we moved to Hamilton in

11:11.437 --> 11:20.709
December of 35. And I was there until about the 1st 
of November of 37, training with the 7th Bomb

11:21.750 --> 11:29.641
Group. And then I transferred to Fransfield in 
California, still in bombardment. That's where

11:35.248 --> 11:38.372
the 6th Bomb Group was at Fransfield. And still 
training. It's still the same mission. Yes,

11:41.186 --> 11:42.288
that's right. Well, Air Force, its mission is 
training. I mean, we were doing other things, but

11:49.839 --> 12:05.803
the mission is training and development of 
doctrine and qualifying of people, having people

11:49.839 --> 12:05.803
so they can be ready to do whatever it is that they 
need doing. ASU went on with that. I got out of the

12:08.086 --> 12:16.558
squadron to Hamilton Field and became the 
assistant group operations officer. So I got some

12:19.062 --> 12:21.926
experience at group level while I was there.

12:25.071 --> 12:26.293
Were you promoted at that time? No. You were still a 
second lieutenant? Yes, let me see.

12:36.622 --> 12:43.148
there were so many of those that they're kind of 
hard to keep up with unless they're referred to the

12:36.622 --> 12:43.148
notes. But at that time, you had people in the Air 
Force who were lieutenants, who had been

12:43.168 --> 12:51.597
lieutenants for seventeen, eighteen years. And I 
went on active duty, of course, as a cadet for a

12:51.717 --> 13:03.068
year, and then the Second Lieutenant Air Reserve 
for

13:06.490 --> 13:08.153
Oh, I guess three years. I'd have to look it up. I 
think that's right. And I was promoted to first

13:10.276 --> 13:13.361
lieutenant, Air Reserve. And then finally I got my 
regular commission in October 1938 and went back

13:14.803 --> 13:21.874
to second lieutenant, regular Air Force, regular 
Army. Now, did you take a drop in pay when you went

13:21.914 --> 13:26.541
from first lieutenant down to second lieutenant? 
Oh, yeah. Well, sure. Then I was promoted to first

13:30.306 --> 13:33.932
lieutenant Army of the United States, which is 
slightly different a little bit later, and then

13:35.819 --> 13:44.665
finally the First Lieutenant in the regular Air 
Force. I think I've got six There are different

13:50.315 --> 13:59.186
categories, different times and all that. It adds 
up to a very confused picture. It's a function of

14:01.129 --> 14:03.652
the times. Now, of course, the times were the 
Depression and many of the men, like you said, were

14:04.193 --> 14:12.083
lieutenants for seventeen, eighteen years.

14:14.846 --> 14:16.108
People were frozen in rank. How was the morale of 
the officer corps? Well,

14:20.622 --> 14:24.627
it was good. They

14:24.687 --> 14:32.255
don't like those things, but those were hard times 
for everybody. The morale of the farmers weren't

14:32.916 --> 14:38.683
very good, or the ranchers, or the accountants, or 
anybody else. So comparatively, I think it's

14:39.784 --> 14:43.248
good. They had people still striving hard to do the 
very best that they could to make something out of

14:47.268 --> 14:54.096
whatever they had. What did you think of the 
quality of those early pilots? Oh, I got nothing

14:58.821 --> 15:01.744
but praise, real praise for them. Very good, I 
think. Real fine. They were a

15:04.968 --> 15:09.833
real fine guy. One of the men that I was assistant to 
as a squadron operations officer was a man named

15:11.534 --> 15:25.233
Walker,

15:11.534 --> 15:25.233
who was killed, lost in the Pacific right after the 
Battle of Midway.

15:28.758 --> 15:41.355
But he had been the commander of that squadron, the 
11th Bomb Squadron, when it was created in France

15:28.758 --> 15:41.355
in World War I, and had flown with it in that 
capacity over there in World And he had in the

15:43.782 --> 15:59.967
meantime done an awful lot of studying as a 
strategist and so I joined with him and two other

15:43.782 --> 15:59.967
people in trying to write a manual on bombardment. 
It was the first manual we ever had and it got

15:59.987 --> 16:08.119
finished and was you.

16:10.023 --> 16:12.687
They were great people, I thought. Take

16:12.747 --> 16:17.634
these hardships in stride and go right on. I've 
heard that in the early, or during the 1930s,

16:18.435 --> 16:33.377
before the war, there was some problem of 
discipline in the Army Air Corps, and there were a

16:18.435 --> 16:33.377
lot of people flying underneath bridges and 
things like that. Did you ever have any problem

16:33.477 --> 16:35.360
with discipline? A lot of aerial acrobatics. 
flying discipline and that kind of thing. Well,

16:42.153 --> 16:43.094
sure.

16:47.941 --> 16:49.884
There's a lot of problems. There were a lot of 
instances of disciplinary action, whether it was

16:50.805 --> 17:03.983
a problem or not, depending upon who you were and 
how you were looking at it. To the Army commander on

17:06.470 --> 17:16.359
to or with whom this air unit was associated, who 
didn't like the Air Force to start with, it was a

17:06.470 --> 17:16.359
pretty big problem.

17:19.521 --> 17:35.515
If you look at the guy who

17:19.521 --> 17:35.515
was guilty of this great breach of discipline, it 
didn't amount to a damn usually.

17:36.963 --> 17:46.237
the Army was very jealous of the Air Corps, 
particularly of people, pilots, because they

17:36.963 --> 17:46.237
drew more money, flying pay. And the other people 
didn't draw the flying pay, because they didn't

17:46.258 --> 17:51.025
fly. But they were very jealous of it. Now, you were 
an artillery to begin with, and then you became a

17:55.853 --> 18:01.001
pilot. I know it was on the Why did you, why were you 
attracted to the Air Corps? Why didn't you decide

18:08.306 --> 18:11.832
to, why didn't you go into the artillery? Well, 
even during that time, pilots on airlines were

18:12.413 --> 18:23.273
drawn 1,800 bucks a month.

18:23.293 --> 18:29.464
And it was, it was something that at first,

18:30.794 --> 18:37.381
It had the other attraction of three meals a day to 
go along with it. There was absolutely nothing for

18:37.401 --> 18:41.285
a person to do in terms of a job. Any place you could 
find a job was something. Of course after I got into

18:45.750 --> 18:50.976
it there were all kinds of attractions. There were 
lots of places to go in terms of things to be done.

18:55.941 --> 18:59.485
And the B-10 showed that there was a way to do it. 
Pilots also had, well, the guy in the dark leather

19:01.051 --> 19:10.024
jacket and the glasses. There was some bit of 
glamour to the job early on and throughout the war,

19:10.044 --> 19:16.073
Errol Flynn and all of that. Were you ever 
attracted to any of that glamour? No, I genuinely

19:18.817 --> 19:22.042
wasn't. But there's a lot more to those leather 
jackets and glasses than glamour. It makes a

19:26.701 --> 19:29.446
difference in whether you survive or not. Yeah, 
yeah. But you know what I'm talking about. Yes, I

19:32.591 --> 19:33.332
do. And I was proud of them.

19:42.187 --> 19:48.798
I didn't think about it as being the glamour, but I 
think about it as representing what I was doing.

19:49.540 --> 19:52.725
And I was quite proud of them. Now 1937, in November 
1937, is that when you went down to the Panama

19:54.562 --> 19:59.690
Canal? Yes. Now why did they send you? Why? Well, 
for two reasons. First place, I'd requested it.

20:08.846 --> 20:15.777
And secondly, they needed people down there to do 
what I could do. And so they acceded to my request

20:16.533 --> 20:20.657
and sent me down. Okay, so you were a squadron's 
operation officer and group operations officer

20:20.677 --> 20:27.044
for how long? Oh, that's until I went to Costa Rica. 
It was about two years. Okay, from 37 to 39. Yeah.

20:35.152 --> 20:35.532
Okay. And your function there was the defense of 
the Canal Zone. Yes, that's right. We were the only

20:41.619 --> 20:45.983
bombardment unit in the Canal Zone. Navy had some 
patrol units, Albrook had some fighter units, but

20:46.452 --> 21:02.334
we were the only bombardment unit, and we had an 
observation squad in there.

21:02.935 --> 21:13.810
During that period of time, you see, 38, 39, when 
the war in Europe was doing lots of things,

21:16.591 --> 21:18.533
It did many things to us. We were trying to get 
ready. We, I don't mean in the squadron. I'm

21:25.060 --> 21:31.787
talking we nationally were trying to get ready to 
do whatever it was going to be necessary for us to

21:25.060 --> 21:31.787
do. But in the meantime, the British were needing 
everything that we could possibly turn loose to

21:32.388 --> 21:39.735
spare them, and we were turning loose an awful lot. 
So we weren't, our own forces were not getting it.

21:46.645 --> 22:01.128
We were expanding the personnel of the Corps as 
rapidly as we could, and that put a premium demand

21:46.645 --> 22:01.128
on whatever experience that you had. So 
experience got thinner and thinner and thinner.

22:05.996 --> 22:12.687
And at one time down there at France Field before I 
was ordered out of there,

22:14.557 --> 22:25.490
There were five officers on the whole base, and I 
had seven different jobs all at the same time. They

22:25.510 --> 22:27.272
were cut that thin.

22:30.115 --> 22:39.366
But it

22:30.115 --> 22:39.366
shows you what you can do. What did you think of the 
defense capabilities of the Panama Canal back

22:40.561 --> 22:49.735
then, right before the Second World War erupted?

22:49.755 --> 22:52.359
What did I think of its capabilities to defend 
itself? Yes. Well,

22:53.681 --> 23:04.878
it would have had a very difficult time defending 
itself against any reasonable threat. I don't

23:05.158 --> 23:09.184
mean that as a criticism, because the people who 
have the resources have to make an evaluation and

23:10.193 --> 23:16.002
allocate those resources where they think they'd 
be needed. And I would have agreed with them not to

23:16.663 --> 23:24.274
allocate them to the Panama Canal, because I think 
we had enough stuff in place to handle that. But if

23:24.815 --> 23:28.761
there had been a serious threat, . How

23:29.602 --> 23:38.555
many bombers, how many pilots did you have? In 
Panama?

23:43.420 --> 23:56.113
Well, by that time we probably only had

23:43.420 --> 23:56.113
like six or eight bombing airplanes. Down there, 
okay. They had other aircraft, fighters and

24:01.499 --> 24:13.191
attack aircraft

24:01.499 --> 24:13.191
that could have, would have been used, but we 
didn't have

24:16.951 --> 24:20.555
We did not have a significant bombardment force 
stationed there. Anti-submarine aircraft

24:22.137 --> 24:28.365
phased through depending upon what was happening 
out in the Caribbean. So at various times there

24:28.385 --> 24:38.157
were different kinds of capabilities, but on 
station there was not a significant bombardment

24:28.385 --> 24:38.157
capability. How are the relations of the 
Panamanians? Well at that time they were

24:41.757 --> 24:47.805
reasonably well workable. There were problems, 
but they weren't too significant. They

24:56.697 --> 25:06.170
didn't really get significant until after the 
war. There were a few incidents, but not very many.

25:11.727 --> 25:12.688
Okay. And what was your opinion when President 
Carter signed the agreement to return the Panama

25:12.708 --> 25:18.678
Canal? Well, I'd hate to express it in the real 
terms that I feel. As far as I'm concerned, the

25:24.747 --> 25:30.115
whole thing is an act of treason.

25:32.919 --> 25:35.423
Not just Carter, but all the things that go with it.

25:41.883 --> 25:47.190
I feel very strongly that it should not have been 
done.

25:47.631 --> 26:01.410
During this time back in the 30s, of course, 
Franklin Roosevelt had a good neighbor policy in

25:47.631 --> 26:01.410
Latin America, and often he had American fliers 
make goodwill trips to some of the Latin and South

25:47.631 --> 26:01.410
American capitals. Did you take any of those 
trips? I didn't take any of the—well, yes, I did,

26:03.493 --> 26:05.837
too. I took one of the goodwill trips.

26:10.705 --> 26:13.188
You noticed my next assignment on there. Sure, 
yeah. While in that assignment, of course, I did

26:15.430 --> 26:21.096
almost 100 percent of my work was in that lot. And I 
headed two or three goodwill trips into other

26:21.736 --> 26:32.988
countries from Panama while I was on that other 
assignment. And I made two, I think, before I went

26:33.008 --> 26:38.113
on that assignment. I didn't lead them or what not, 
but I participated in two of them. Where were they,

26:45.625 --> 26:46.506
two? One was to Guatemala, from Panama, and

26:46.666 --> 26:55.834
one was to Costa Rica. I think that's the only two I 
participated in. How well were they received?

26:59.817 --> 27:00.938
Very, very well indeed. Very well indeed.

27:06.143 --> 27:08.725
It was a very necessary and very constructive 
thing.

27:12.249 --> 27:21.623
Now you left there in 1939 to go on to be the 
assistant military assay for air for Guatemala,

27:12.249 --> 27:21.623
El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, 
Panama, and Colombia. Where were you

27:22.745 --> 27:23.927
headquartered? Headquarters in San Jose, Costa 
Rica.

27:30.558 --> 27:34.483
worked out of San Jose to cover all the rest of that 
country. No kidding. Now they probably have air

27:35.444 --> 27:39.690
out of shade every single one of those countries. 
Well, I think they did have

27:40.211 --> 27:48.782
before this Nicaraguan thing stirred up. I don't 
know what the situation is right now. And what do

27:52.394 --> 27:57.943
you think about, whenever you're in NSJ, of 
course, you're in somewhat of a diplomatic

27:52.394 --> 27:57.943
position. What do you think of that type of 
position, which is very different from being a

27:57.983 --> 28:03.812
military pilot? Yes, it is. When I went on that job, 
the State Department people thought of me as an

28:07.458 --> 28:14.269
airplane jockey. And they reminded me I rank with 
but under the vice council.

28:22.533 --> 28:28.081
My determination was to make it something other 
than that, and I did. So I made my own name both in the

28:29.763 --> 28:40.179
State Department and in G2 Intelligence in 
Washington, which was of course our parent

28:29.763 --> 28:40.179
department.

28:45.226 --> 28:49.552
So I got everybody's mind changed by the time I 
left. Would you explain what was the problem? What

28:52.992 --> 28:54.574
do you mean you got their minds changed? Have you 
been overseas very much in having to deal with the

28:56.657 --> 29:01.564
State Department? No, not with the

29:02.285 --> 29:06.231
State Department. The State Department at that 
time, and some people would say it's just as bad

29:06.251 --> 29:21.953
now, although I wouldn't, were a very superior 
people in their own estimation. And anything that

29:23.806 --> 29:45.915
anyone did in a foreign country to which they were 
assigned,

29:23.806 --> 29:45.915
they were God's children to make the moral 
determination as to whether it was right or not and

29:23.806 --> 29:45.915
be critical and do whatever else their wisdom 
called for in terms of family in that country.

29:49.220 --> 29:54.587
And they spent long hours to be goddamn sure you 
understood that, whoever you happened to be. And

29:54.627 --> 30:02.977
this worked insofar as members of your family are 
concerned, everybody else.

30:07.502 --> 30:11.447
Well, that's something I didn't like very much. 
But I was there not because I liked to be there, but

30:11.714 --> 30:19.445
there to do a job, so I handled myself in such a way as 
to best do that job.

30:22.770 --> 30:38.413
But one of the ways, one of the things I had to do to do 
it was to gain some respect

30:22.770 --> 30:38.413
for 2nd Lieutenant's Air Force, because I was the 
first one of them that had ever been on a job like

30:22.770 --> 30:38.413
that.

30:40.891 --> 30:47.762
So I had to get better at their business than they 
were at their business in many respects in order to

30:40.891 --> 30:47.762
do that, which I think I did. But I had the advantage 
of them in many ways. And I got personally to know

30:51.809 --> 31:00.143
the presidents of all those people, their 
ministers of foreign affairs and everything

30:51.809 --> 31:00.143
else. And I could go and call them whenever I wanted 
to. and after I had done it a few times they began to

31:06.862 --> 31:16.254
call for me to come to see them rather than some 
other people who otherwise would have gone. I

31:17.816 --> 31:34.118
think I had the record in that I had breakfast with 
four presidents one morning in their respective

31:17.816 --> 31:34.118
palaces before ten o'clock in the morning.

31:34.722 --> 31:42.289
Guatemala, to Salvador, to Honduras, to 
Nicaragua, to Costa Rica.

31:42.309 --> 31:45.092
And I had a message for them. They knew that. And

31:47.034 --> 31:55.442
so they had their cars to the airport to meet me, and 
I went straight and had breakfast with each of them

31:47.034 --> 31:55.442
on the way. What was the message? Do you remember?

32:02.701 --> 32:18.987
the U.S. was going to take over all German and 
Italian ships on the high seas, which really meant

32:02.701 --> 32:18.987
the ones that were in port in their countries 
couldn't get out. And it meant that if they wanted

32:20.769 --> 32:27.460
them, they had to act that day to take them over, 
which they did. sent troops aboard to command, to

32:28.891 --> 32:32.175
control the ships. And that's when so many of them 
were scuttled in the ports and tried to block the

32:33.256 --> 32:41.065
harbor and everything else down there. Now was 
there, of course this must have been December 8th

32:41.085 --> 32:48.973
or 9th or something like that, 1941, right after we 
got into, right after Pearl Harbor. No, it was

32:48.993 --> 32:50.075
before that. I've forgotten when it was. See, we 
had them blocked up quite a long while before Pearl

32:52.237 --> 32:56.822
Harbor. And the Le Monde Bay in Panama was full of 
ships long before that. And they couldn't get out

33:05.301 --> 33:07.824
of there. The Rene Adore and the Andre Adore,

33:09.686 --> 33:19.137
and dozens of them that were tied up there. And they 
were tied up for, had been for a year by that time.

33:24.023 --> 33:28.328
Afraid to get, as soon as they go through that gate, 
either

33:30.316 --> 33:37.706
somebody would get them, British submarines, or 
we would take them in tow or something. So they were

33:37.726 --> 33:43.373
sitting out on the east side of the canal then? On 
each end of the canal, yes. That's right, they

33:46.658 --> 33:47.358
were. But there were also ships in Punta Arenas and 
Costa Rica and Puerto Barrios and Guatemala and

33:47.459 --> 33:59.935
other ports in the other countries along there. 
that those countries had been allowing to

34:00.995 --> 34:13.309
stay in port and fly their own flag and take care of 
their own business. But the next day they were all

34:13.329 --> 34:17.675
in a different status. They put their own troops 
aboard and taken them all.

34:25.904 --> 34:30.850
Was there a big fear of German influence? Oh, yes. 
It wasn't just a fear. It was a reality. It wasn't

34:38.623 --> 34:46.536
too bad in Central America, or not nearly as bad as 
it was in South America, and particularly in

34:38.623 --> 34:46.536
Columbia. One of the reasons I later moved to 
Columbia from that was to facilitate the takeover

34:55.687 --> 35:16.587
a Colombian airline,

34:55.687 --> 35:16.587
which was owned,

34:55.687 --> 35:16.587
oh, ninety-some percent by a German airline. And I 
became as good friends as you can with an enemy. to

35:22.973 --> 35:26.077
their chief pilot, Colonel Boyle, who was down 
there.

35:30.022 --> 35:41.216
And we finally did get the government of Columbia 
and Pan American to get together and act

35:30.022 --> 35:41.216
to get the Germans out of there. And I picked up one 
of the German Junker airplanes and flew it out of

35:42.217 --> 35:50.888
there and flew it back to Panama Canal.

35:54.935 --> 35:58.260
That was just incidental to the job. The job was to 
get Pan American to take them over. You must have

36:05.952 --> 36:14.926
engaged in

36:05.952 --> 36:14.926
quite a bit of intelligence gathering. You betcha 
I did. I bet I could. Sure did. An investigation of

36:22.373 --> 36:51.570
reports is one of the big jobs they have there, and I 
had some problems with that, but

36:22.373 --> 36:51.570
there were reports, persistent reports, of an 
area in the Amazon basin where the Germans and

36:22.373 --> 36:51.570
Italians, or both, were supposed to be equipping 
long-range airplanes to fly out of there and close

36:52.698 --> 36:55.141
the canal. And there were persistent reports 
coming out of there of that, and you couldn't get an

36:57.444 --> 37:02.650
answer to it. But at that time, I had a C-45, which is 
a bimotored Beechcraft airplane.

37:13.363 --> 37:21.473
And with its regular gas tanks on it, it's got about 
500

37:13.363 --> 37:21.473
miles, maybe, range, something like that. But 
when I got it, I had two extra tanks put in, one in the

37:23.478 --> 37:28.266
nose and one in the tail. But that still only gave me 
a little over 700, 750 miles of rain.

37:37.581 --> 37:39.905
To do this, I needed more gasoline than that. So I 
did something that was kind of silly, but it

37:42.549 --> 37:45.154
worked. I went to Via Vicentio, which is just over 
the mountains down in the Llanos back of Bogota in

37:51.119 --> 37:55.183
Colombia.

37:58.546 --> 38:05.592
We had a bunch of 35-gallon gasoline drums, filled 
them up and put them in the cabin of the airplane.

38:08.254 --> 38:09.235
Eleven of them. I think it was a little hole. And 
arranged a way that I could pump out of that barrel

38:12.078 --> 38:20.485
out through my window and into the tank on the wing.

38:25.105 --> 38:36.422
So I took off from the Vicencio and went direct to 
Leticia, which is where Columbia, a little tid of

38:25.105 --> 38:36.422
it, comes onto the Amazon. And then I followed the 
Amazon down to nearly even to Manaus, and went over

38:36.442 --> 38:51.265
and investigated this area that they talked about 
and photographed it, and flew back to Manaus and up

38:36.442 --> 38:51.265
the Orianoco to Venezuela. where the META and the 
Orinoco joined, and then I flew down the META back

38:52.342 --> 39:00.934
to Villasencio.

39:03.177 --> 39:11.749
About 2350 miles in one flight, one airplane. And 
we started about 3 o'clock in the morning, late in

39:11.769 --> 39:16.556
the afternoon. We were getting late in the 
afternoon when we came back.

39:23.712 --> 39:38.926
But I was, and I never had a ceiling of more than 400 
feet that whole damn day until I got clear back up to

39:23.712 --> 39:38.926
Oriental, to the Oriental, which meant a good many 
hours of flying that treetop blind, and I was the

39:23.712 --> 39:38.926
only pilot. And boy, I had my crew chief and a 
photographer was the only thing that I had in

39:39.067 --> 39:43.431
there. Well, did you see anything, any pictures? 
Well, I found the location, and I found a lot of the

39:46.373 --> 39:51.238
things that people had been talking about. For 
example?

39:54.718 --> 39:55.679
They called it hangers. They were big barns and 
lumber sheds and whatnot. But I photographed the

39:58.182 --> 40:03.087
whole thing and brought the photograph back for 
interpretation.

40:05.409 --> 40:11.075
There was nothing there of the nature of the things 
that they were talking about. But it did enable us

40:13.678 --> 40:17.462
to close out the problem. and get it over with, 
where you could spend an awful lot of time chasing

40:18.050 --> 40:25.640
it down or thinking about it or trying to get 
somebody in there. It was a thousand miles from

40:26.361 --> 40:31.988
almost any place down in that jungle away. It would 
take months and cost mints to get people in there to

40:32.909 --> 40:37.535
find out. You'd get most of them killed anyway.

40:43.262 --> 40:44.884
So we got them out. when we were coming back down the 
Meta, coming home.

40:51.995 --> 40:53.457
There's no navigation age. You're still 
navigating by dead right now.

40:58.884 --> 41:04.552
I flew into a rain storm, which of course you do 
quite often. We were only about 300 miles north of

41:04.572 --> 41:06.816
the Amazon. I was down below the trees on the Meta 
River flying in this rain storm. which is not a good

41:15.070 --> 41:18.395
thing to do in most circumstances. I didn't do it 
just for fun. I mean, I had to hit where I was going. I

41:24.384 --> 41:29.992
couldn't afford to miss it.

41:30.012 --> 41:32.756
I flew through this thing, it seemed like, for a 
long time. It must have been more than five or ten

41:32.776 --> 41:39.246
minutes, but

41:32.776 --> 41:39.246
down below the trees. Pulled out a nice curtain and 
beautiful sunshine. I pulled it up to about 3,000

41:45.462 --> 41:49.928
feet and headed on toward Villasencio.

41:52.191 --> 42:01.082
The sergeant, the crew chief had been sitting in 
the co-pilot seat all this time.

42:01.122 --> 42:09.293
He looked out the window and turned around and 
looked over to me and he said, Lieutenant, there

42:01.122 --> 42:09.293
are times when I wish I had never known you.

42:12.530 --> 42:14.352
I said, well, we're going home right now. He said, 
thank God.

42:20.979 --> 42:22.681
Fine-sighted, real fine guy. So, we went on home, 
but I covered that one. The thing that was

42:27.606 --> 42:36.075
disconcerting about it was, on the last barrel of 
gasoline, we got about half of it into the tank and

42:27.606 --> 42:36.075
the damn wobble pump broke.

42:38.958 --> 42:41.220
I didn't have another one. one of the things that 
people would say, well,

42:42.584 --> 42:52.437
you didn't make adequate pavilion because your 
wobble pump broke. Well, maybe right. But if it had

42:55.081 --> 43:03.692
broke three barrels earlier, we wouldn't have 
gone home, or two barrels or one for that

42:55.081 --> 43:03.692
matter. So from that particular spot in the 
Amazon, could the Germans ever have built an

43:07.306 --> 43:17.523
airplane that could have fueled and have enough 
fuel, the capability to bomb the Panama Canal?

43:17.543 --> 43:18.204
Yes, they could. Yes, they could have, all right. 
So it was a realistic prospect? Oh, that meant the

43:21.489 --> 43:23.412
prospect was real enough. It's just that the 
intelligence is so bad, and it is so hard to come by,

43:25.476 --> 43:34.410
that You need to be able to look into it so you can 
quit worrying about it after a while, because it

43:34.728 --> 43:42.820
just takes too much resources to worry about it.

43:47.087 --> 44:00.027
But it was a bit of ingenuity that people find out 
about, and so then they perceive you a little

43:47.087 --> 44:00.027
differently, some with respect, some not.

44:03.466 --> 44:05.308
Did you like being a diplomat? Yes, in most senses 
of the word, and it certainly was good for me. I got

44:12.397 --> 44:26.695
to meet and understand and work with all of the 
governments and the presidents of those various

44:12.397 --> 44:26.695
countries and the chiefs of all of their armed 
services, particularly their air force. And I got

44:27.957 --> 44:32.983
a lot of, made a lot of good friends, many of whom I 
still stay in contact with. Most of them are dead

44:35.345 --> 44:43.938
now because most of them were older than I was at the 
time, but it was wonderful for me. Did you do any

44:44.118 --> 44:50.688
training to help them start an Air Force or to help 
them develop the training program? No, except in

44:51.148 --> 44:53.832
establishing requirements. You see, when we were 
doing training, we had another group of people

44:53.852 --> 45:02.245
there that was an Air Force mission. and that was 
not the responsibility we had to share. For

45:08.235 --> 45:22.075
instance, in Columbia at the time that I was there, 
we had a military mission there who was teaching

45:08.235 --> 45:22.075
them how to fly a bunch of new airplanes that they 
had bought from the United States. The man there,

45:22.696 --> 45:25.380
the head of the mission, was a man named Whitson. 
who was head of the bombardment section at Kelly

45:26.086 --> 45:33.833
Field when I graduated in bombardment from Kelly 
Field.

45:36.676 --> 45:42.822
But he was an older man and was independent of 
attachés.

45:45.204 --> 45:48.247
Did they give you special language training when 
you went down? No, I didn't have time. I spoke

45:51.671 --> 45:54.253
Spanish fairly well from growing up where I did out 
in El Dorado and working with Mexicans all along

45:55.465 --> 46:05.018
and so I spoke pretty well and I had two years of 
Spanish in high school. So, well I wouldn't want to

46:07.381 --> 46:16.574
have a press conference necessarily in Spanish. I 
could handle, I could get what I wanted and I get to

46:16.674 --> 46:21.921
understand. Where were you When Pearl Harbor was 
attacked? I was at about 14,000 feet coming from

46:28.575 --> 46:34.244
Viva Centro into Bogota, Colombia. In other 
words, I was stationed in Bogota at the time. When

46:38.211 --> 46:41.897
you first heard about it over the radio? What were 
your thoughts? What were your thoughts?

46:48.436 --> 46:58.728
Well, my main thought, as it had been for some time, 
was to get the hell out of there and get into the war,

46:48.436 --> 46:58.728
because I was stuck in that State Department 
intelligence setup and wasn't able to get out. And

46:59.990 --> 47:05.015
my first thought was that those bastards can't 
keep me here now. They're going to have to get me out

47:05.156 --> 47:06.497
of here. Well, they did. It took another year after 
that. Well, not a year. No idea. Yes, it did, too. It

47:12.965 --> 47:13.605
took more than a year. Until December?
