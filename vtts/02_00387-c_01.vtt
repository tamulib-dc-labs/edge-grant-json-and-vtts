00:01.820 --> 00:05.284
I was in the Bureau of Mines in the fairly early 30s. 
At that time, we had a station in Pittsburgh. It was

00:12.193 --> 00:18.681
on the grounds of the Kearney Institute up there, 
and it was a comparatively small station. But

00:19.882 --> 00:22.926
there was a man by the name of Storch. Oh, yes, H.H. 
Storch. H.H. Storch and several of his associates

00:25.249 --> 00:31.236
who had been, Lester Hurst, for example, who had 
been doing laboratory work on coal hydrogenation

00:32.245 --> 00:36.670
for a long, long time. And the publications on that 
are still available. Many of them I have here. But

00:44.560 --> 00:48.064
this was all really small-scale autoclave work. 
It was, in essence, a duplication of a lot of the

00:48.084 --> 00:56.734
research work that the Germans had carried out 
before they built their plants in Germany. And

00:58.233 --> 01:04.442
that work continued through the, until about 
1940. In 1940,

01:04.462 --> 01:24.612
I was transferred from experimental work to the 
Washington office and became assistant director

01:04.462 --> 01:24.612
of the fuels and explosive service under a man by 
the name of Dr. Fielder. we probably haven't run

01:25.756 --> 01:27.718
into on this yet. But he had a very active part in 
really getting synthetic fuel work started in

01:27.738 --> 01:32.184
Jeremiah. And about that time, the Secretary of 
Interior, Harold Ickes, and his assistants

01:33.766 --> 01:47.623
became interested in synthetic fuel work. And 
then in 1941, as you remember, we got in the war with

01:48.684 --> 01:55.172
Japan and the war with the European powers.

01:57.970 --> 02:21.168
And

01:57.970 --> 02:21.168
during that war, the Allies furnished most of the 
oil for Europe because they were cut off from any

01:57.970 --> 02:21.168
other sources of oil and they lost the Romanian oil 
and so on and so forth.

02:21.188 --> 02:24.754
Mike Strauss, who was then one of the assistant 
secretaries, became very active with beer mines,

02:25.561 --> 02:48.823
and as the war went on, about 1942 or 1943, he 
proposed that the beer mines start a more vigorous

02:25.561 --> 02:48.823
and enlarged program on synthetic fuels on the 
basis that maybe at the end of the war we might need

02:25.561 --> 02:48.823
synthetic fuels as a possible source for oil. 
Thank you. The...

02:56.780 --> 03:03.547
The Secretary's office got over to Congress, and 
they talked to a number of congressmen. In

03:05.008 --> 03:14.638
particular, we might mention Senator O'Mahony 
from Wyoming and Congressman Randolph from West

03:05.008 --> 03:14.638
Virginia. Congressman Randolph is now Senator 
Randolph, by the way. And Murdoch. from Utah, and

03:22.733 --> 03:26.218
Gurney, I don't remember his first name. I believe 
he's from North Dakota. And what was his first

03:27.901 --> 03:28.963
name, Edward? I forgot.

03:33.490 --> 03:35.774
And these senators became interested. And then 
the secretary's office suggested to Bureau of

03:35.814 --> 03:48.133
Mines that we make a trip to, this was wartime by 
then, it was about 1942. And they suggested that we

03:48.755 --> 03:57.046
make a trip to England to study the coal 
hydrogenation work that the English had done at

03:48.755 --> 03:57.046
Billingham. And in fact, they had a sizable plant 
operating at Billingham on the hydrogenation of

03:57.106 --> 04:02.933
coal and tar. So H.H. Storch, Dr. Storch, and I went 
to England and spent about a month with the English

04:04.575 --> 04:15.910
people, mostly at Billingham and related 
facilities. And they, very, very kind to us,

04:16.278 --> 04:23.644
revealed much of the data they had accumulated on 
building this big plant. And as a matter of fact,

04:23.664 --> 04:30.410
the large plant was designed almost specifically 
after the German coal hydrogenation plants. And

04:32.372 --> 04:45.863
we came back to this country, and then the senators 
thought that we should make a tour of a number of

04:32.372 --> 04:45.863
states and begin to try to acquaint people in a 
general way with not only with coal

04:46.501 --> 04:51.527
hydrogenation, but with the Fischer-Tropsch 
process as well. There were no Fischer-Tropsch

04:52.408 --> 05:06.245
plants in existence outside of Germany at that 
time, but we had a good deal of information about

04:52.408 --> 05:06.245
the Fischer-Tropsch process and had worked on it 
in the Bureau of Mines as well. So there was a

05:07.467 --> 05:15.276
senatorial group got together and We went down to 
West Virginia. We went to Pittsburgh. And they

05:20.739 --> 05:24.202
gave speeches and talks. And then we went out west 
to Sheridan, Wyoming, where Senator O'Mahony was

05:24.603 --> 05:31.951
an influential man. And we went to Utah. And we 
toured several other states, trying to generate

05:34.754 --> 05:40.740
some interest in the synthetic floor. And as a 
result of that, there was passed the Synthetic

05:41.733 --> 05:47.362
Fuel Act. I believe it was of 1944, but don't hold me 
to that. That's correct. It was 1944. And that

05:55.796 --> 06:04.230
provided funds, up to a good many million dollars, 
to investigate synthetic fuels. And about the

06:06.775 --> 06:29.362
time this act was passed, we started work to build 
laboratories at Brewston, Pennsylvania, which

06:06.775 --> 06:29.362
is now called PERC, by the way, and the Morgantown 
Laboratory at Morgantown, West Virginia, which

06:06.775 --> 06:29.362
is now called MERC, M-E-R-C. And we built the 
Louisiana, Missouri. Louisiana, Missouri is

06:29.783 --> 06:34.048
about 85 miles north of St. Louis on the 
Mississippi River. We started to build a

06:34.855 --> 06:45.409
demonstration plant for the coal hydrogenation 
operations and a smaller Fisher-Tropsch plant

06:34.855 --> 06:45.409
for the Fisher-Tropsch operations. We also 
undertook the building of the oil shale plant at

06:46.951 --> 06:59.206
Rifle, Colorado, and built the laboratory at 
Laramie, Wyoming, which is the oil shale

06:46.951 --> 06:59.206
laboratory. All of that was really done under that 
particular act. But as we began to go into our

07:05.939 --> 07:16.099
development work on these projects, the war was 
drawing to a close. And you asked me briefly about

07:17.361 --> 07:27.441
the various teams that went over to Germany to 
investigate the German industry. Now, there were

07:28.433 --> 07:35.068
a good many of those teams dealing with chemicals 
and various aspects of German industry. The one we

07:35.088 --> 07:42.544
were interested in, of course, was called the oil 
team, really, and dealt with oil and synthetic

07:35.088 --> 07:42.544
fuels both. And I guess probably it comprised from 
150 to 200 people, but not necessarily all at once.

07:52.694 --> 08:02.386
I mean, they went at various times and they came 
back at various times, so it was rather an

07:52.694 --> 08:02.386
indeterminate group at any one time. But those 
people were selected. They were largely either

08:06.291 --> 08:13.020
from the government, mainly from the Bureau of 
Mines or other groups in the government who had

08:13.220 --> 08:35.363
been doing work with oil or synthetic fuels, or 
they were from the oil industry itself, from

08:13.220 --> 08:35.363
practically all the oil companies, all the major 
oil companies certainly sent one or more people to

08:13.220 --> 08:35.363
take part in these investigations. And there were 
also people from some of the coal companies and

08:36.001 --> 08:50.459
people from companies like coppers and so on and so 
forth who had connections in foreign countries

08:36.001 --> 08:50.459
and who had worked in this field in one way or 
another. As I remember it, that organization went

08:52.883 --> 09:04.978
along all during the latter part of 1944 and then 
during the In the early part of 1945, during

09:05.060 --> 09:31.197
January and February, various groups of these 
individuals were transferred to London and then

09:05.060 --> 09:31.197
from London went into the field to learn what we 
could as soon as the German army was driven out of

09:05.060 --> 09:31.197
the plants and we could get in and begin our 
investigations.

09:32.599 --> 09:34.982
As far as synthetic fuels is concerned, I will not 
treat the oil industry because this is a different

09:36.228 --> 09:43.058
topic, really, and I don't think we need to bring it 
in at this point. As far as synthetic fuels was

09:44.260 --> 09:51.230
concerned, we were particularly interested. 
There were 12 coal hydrogenation plants, and I

09:51.270 --> 10:02.927
suppose on the average they ran around 5,000 to 
7,000 or 8,000 barrels a day. Not all these plants

10:03.802 --> 10:14.057
were available because some were in the Russian 
zones, but I guess we visited and studied about

10:03.802 --> 10:14.057
eight of these cohydrogenation plants. And if my 
memory serves correctly, there were about seven

10:15.859 --> 10:21.928
Fischer-Tropsch plants. And I believe that we 
visited essentially all of those. As I remember,

10:28.415 --> 10:35.423
the fish and trophy plants were pretty much in the 
zones that we could get at, so we also got a chance to

10:28.415 --> 10:35.423
look at the fish and trophy plants. They were 
smaller plants, in general running around 2,000

10:36.083 --> 10:43.632
barrels a day of fuel.

10:44.633 --> 10:47.376
Now, in addition to that, of course, As you know, 
the Germans were always strong in coal

10:47.491 --> 10:59.211
technology, and they had a group of laboratories 
who had been doing coal technology work, I guess,

10:47.491 --> 10:59.211
for 15 or 20 years. And we visited all those 
laboratories and, in fact, tried to talk to all the

10:59.331 --> 11:10.309
people that we knew of that had been instrumental 
in coal work. And in addition to that, we visited a

11:11.808 --> 11:15.634
lot of other concerns. For instance, people who 
had been doing gasification work, like Lurgy. And

11:22.565 --> 11:29.737
Lurgy had been interested in gasification, I 
guess, since the early 1930s. And

11:30.138 --> 11:38.271
then we visited people like Coppers,

11:38.875 --> 11:43.925
Later on, developed the coprostatic process for 
gasification, which you've probably heard

11:38.875 --> 11:43.925
about. The

11:43.965 --> 11:57.812
groups were divided up into sort of working teams, 
and at any one time you might... You might have

11:58.383 --> 12:07.917
involved in a team two people or four people or 
probably six people, usually not many more than

11:58.383 --> 12:07.917
that. And they were assigned targets, and they 
selected these targets. By the way, I was in

12:12.384 --> 12:20.256
general a leader of the team, although I wasn't 
always in a position where I could do much leading

12:12.384 --> 12:20.256
because I was in the field a lot. But we tried to 
divide this work up and assign it to people who were

12:20.928 --> 12:26.875
most knowledgeable in these fields. And the thing 
evolved without any trouble at all because these

12:26.995 --> 12:39.891
were highly skilled and highly knowledgeable 
people, and they knew very much about what they

12:26.995 --> 12:39.891
wanted to see when they went over there, and they 
learned a great deal more. And so they in

12:40.411 --> 12:47.920
themselves were capable of more or less picking 
out their targets and going there and doing the

12:40.411 --> 12:47.920
investigation. And we might spend... If it were a 
laboratory or something like that, we might spend

12:51.067 --> 12:54.070
two or three days at it. If it were a plant, we might 
spend a week or more at it. And oftentimes, two or

12:57.814 --> 13:06.903
three teams investigated various aspects of a 
plant because... Excuse me, I'm going to let you

13:07.504 --> 13:08.885
interrupt. Yeah, I have a couple of questions I 
want to ask for my purposes. If you went into a

13:12.069 --> 13:17.855
plant, you went completely through it 
mechanically as well as checking its records?

13:17.895 --> 13:19.116
Yes, we did. We tried to accumulate as much of the 
records as we could. And wherever possible, we

13:23.993 --> 13:27.358
made notes from those records. And in some cases, 
we could get copies of the records. And all of those

13:30.403 --> 13:36.772
things were compiled and brought back to London or 
to Brussels. A lot of this work was done out of

13:36.993 --> 13:39.096
Brussels. And each time we investigated a target, 
we wrote a report out of it. It was a CIOS report,

13:46.562 --> 13:50.367
chaos we often call it. Some people call it chaos, 
but this was a matter of choice, I guess. And those

13:56.394 --> 14:01.160
reports were all eventually brought back here. 
They were compiled and edited by the Bureau of

14:03.123 --> 14:09.471
Mines and various other groups, by the oil 
industry and so on and so forth. And eventually,

14:09.991 --> 14:19.399
the Department of Commerce set up a sort of a 
central location that was to do printing and

14:09.991 --> 14:19.399
reproduction of those, but what happened to all 
those reports, I can't tell you. We have them all.

14:20.300 --> 14:23.583
We have the BIOS, the SIOS, and the FIAT. Well, I'm 
glad to know that, because I may need some of these

14:23.603 --> 14:31.610
myself before this thing goes too far. What about 
field notes? Did you save your field notes, I

14:33.391 --> 14:35.133
wonder? Oh, no. As far as I know, we didn't. We wrote 
final, what we called final reports, and as far as I

14:39.505 --> 14:48.036
know, I never saved my field notes, and I don't know 
if other people did save their field notes. This

14:48.056 --> 14:53.043
accumulated to quite a lot of paper as time went on, 
you know, and we were very limited. See, we were

14:53.543 --> 15:02.055
working in the field, and houses were all torn 
down, and we were living under very difficult and

14:53.543 --> 15:02.055
strenuous conditions, and so on and so forth. Most 
of our writing we did in Brussels and London,

15:02.075 --> 15:06.981
really. Now, any other questions? Oh, yeah. Fire 
away. Yes, I have a whole bunch. What first

15:12.899 --> 15:14.861
interested you in synthetic fuels? Why are you in 
the Bureau of Mines in 1939? That's awfully early

15:17.484 --> 15:22.350
to be interested in synthetic fuels. Well, the 
Bureau of Mines, as you probably know, was

15:22.370 --> 15:37.407
originally established really to control and 
investigate and guide and help the mining

15:22.370 --> 15:37.407
industry And out of that grew a great desire to 
improve and modify the utilization of coal. And

15:49.008 --> 15:56.560
my first interest, actually, was in water 
conditioning. But then I became more and more

15:57.621 --> 16:04.812
immersed in hydrocarbon chemistry. By the time 
1935 and 1936 was around, I was pretty much

16:05.365 --> 16:17.098
involved with oil and coal chemistry.

16:17.859 --> 16:24.627
Then I went in to work with Dr. Filner, and this was 
the fuels and explosives service. I had little to

16:25.668 --> 16:34.798
do with the explosive ends of it, but all of my work 
was on the fuels ends, which included coal and

16:25.668 --> 16:34.798
petroleum. I think at that time that there was 
always a feeling in the Bureau of Mines that since

16:35.082 --> 17:04.431
we had such enormous reserves of coal, and since we 
didn't really know how much oil we had or even how

16:35.082 --> 17:04.431
long those reserves might last, that we should 
look forward and begin the investigation of coal

17:05.120 --> 17:10.585
and particularly with the possibility of 
converting coal to oil and gas. Now, I think at this

17:11.566 --> 17:19.074
point you ought to understand one or two things 
about the chemistry of coal. The difference

17:19.995 --> 17:31.566
between coal and oil from the viewpoint of 
ultimate analysis, that is the amount of carbon,

17:19.995 --> 17:31.566
hydrogen, and oxygen they contain, is that oil 
runs around 8%, 10%, or 11% hydrogen, the rest of it

17:32.373 --> 17:58.448
being mainly carbon, while coal is about half that 
much hydrogen, the rest of it being mainly carbon,

17:32.373 --> 17:58.448
but that there are other elements in coal like 
sulfur and oxygen and ash and so on and so forth. So

17:59.137 --> 18:07.487
the thought has always been, and this was true of 
the Germans, and it was true of all the people in

17:59.137 --> 18:07.487
Europe, and it was true of our own chemists here. 
Our basic idea was that if we could add about 5% or 6%

18:08.989 --> 18:22.026
hydrogen to a whole particle, we could, in fact, 
convert it to liquid. And this doesn't sound like a

18:22.046 --> 18:25.950
very difficult job, does it? It sounds easy. I 
think it was these, and 80% of our hydrocarbon

18:28.567 --> 18:35.857
reserves are certainly in the form of coal. So 
there was every reason for the United States to

18:37.459 --> 18:48.094
begin to point itself in the direction of making 
oil from coal on first a basis that we might

18:48.732 --> 18:57.403
ultimately run out of oil or get low on oil, and 
second, maybe it offered economic

18:48.732 --> 18:57.403
possibilities. Now, the economic possibilities 
have been difficult to find and are still

18:57.463 --> 19:08.376
difficult to find, but we may face the prospect 
that we have to use our coal reserves to help

18:57.463 --> 19:08.376
supplement our oil reserves. And this was the 
basis that the Bureau of Mines got in on this thing.

19:12.020 --> 19:14.464
And this explains why you're involved in it so 
early. And I got involved in it, as I say, about 37 or

19:15.105 --> 19:23.137
38, and my interest in it has been almost 
continuous since that time. The first time we

19:23.177 --> 19:27.364
picked you up in our work, we have you identified in 
explosives. Now, how did we come up with that? That

19:29.246 --> 19:34.374
was because I was assistant chief of the fuels and 
explosives service. But I have done very little in

19:34.635 --> 19:37.259
explosives, really. And I take it technically, 
then, you were not ever really in the Army.

19:41.602 --> 19:51.894
Technically, we were only put into the Army as 
experts, not as full Army. I was never really a—we

19:53.156 --> 19:57.020
were—what did they call us? Simulated colonels or 
something like that. I've forgotten what— But we

20:03.083 --> 20:07.507
actually wore uniforms over there and so on and so 
forth. But I had no Army training nor no Army pay or

20:08.047 --> 20:11.871
anything else. Now, when the Germans are 
interviewed, they can't really distinguish

20:11.891 --> 20:15.594
between yourselves and soldiers.

20:18.256 --> 20:19.697
That is true. They really think that they're being 
interviewed by the US Army all the way through. I

20:23.261 --> 20:26.664
had never thought of that, but I think that is. So 
that means a sizable number of the people involved

20:26.744 --> 20:31.808
in Tom then were civilians. And not military 
personnel? Well, they were all. Everybody was a

20:34.768 --> 20:35.870
civilian. I wonder if any list of those people were 
ever compiled. Yeah, I'm sure there were lists of

20:38.593 --> 20:40.676
them. But where you'd find them, I don't know. I 
could probably tell you 50 of them if I sat here and

20:44.040 --> 20:48.405
thought a while about it.

20:53.211 --> 20:57.897
And if you go through those reels and reports, 
you'll find they're all authors of those reports.

20:59.108 --> 21:04.678
Now, those people are essentially all civilians. 
Now, there was another group of people over there.

21:08.625 --> 21:19.524
There was a Navy team under Captain Pettyjohn who 
also did a lot of interviewing, and there was some

21:08.625 --> 21:19.524
rivalry between these two groups. It wasn't 
serious, but there was some rivalry. Now, he's

21:22.389 --> 21:23.631
retired to Florida. Yes, I think you're right. 
Sarasota, Florida, that's the man we are. Yeah,

21:28.184 --> 21:30.307
you want to talk to Petty John. Sarasota, Florida, 
of course. This probably will give you a little

21:33.811 --> 21:37.256
explanation of how this came about. Now, I would 
like to say this about the Germans. As far as the

21:43.083 --> 21:50.513
upper class of German technical people that we 
knew, that we dealt with over there, many of those

21:51.320 --> 22:19.977
we had corresponded with before the war and many of 
those people knew that we were scientists and not

21:51.320 --> 22:19.977
soldiers in any way shape or form you know and uh it 
was a it was a rather strange situation uh uh we went

21:51.320 --> 22:19.977
over and talked to people like dr hoobman from 
lurgy and payer pier from uh from uh IG Farman and

22:20.767 --> 22:25.672
people like that, they knew us well from previous 
correspondence. And there was no problem, no

22:25.992 --> 22:32.439
animosity between the groups that were involved 
in most cases at all. And I had no feeling, really,

22:34.822 --> 22:43.110
that I was a soldier of a conquered country or 
anything like that. And I think 99% of our people

22:43.131 --> 22:47.415
would have never even thought of that, you know. It 
was just colleagues? We were scientists speaking

22:50.967 --> 22:53.671
to scientists. That was the story. And that we 
happened to be on one side and they happened to be on

22:56.215 --> 23:02.204
another side, probably it was incidental to the 
whole... Were the Germans further ahead in

23:02.865 --> 23:06.150
technology than you anticipated them being? 
Well, no, I don't think so. In the sense that we had

23:10.857 --> 23:17.807
read about their technology and knew about their 
technology, but... The truth is that we had no real

23:18.530 --> 23:25.721
plant technology on synthetic fuels in this 
country. We had laboratory technology. But they

23:29.546 --> 23:35.956
were the only ones who really had gone ahead with 
this plant technology. Now, as the

23:35.976 --> 23:41.504
investigations went on, we got into every aspect 
of this. And as you realize, these are very complex

23:41.684 --> 23:47.693
and very large, very complex plants, very high 
pressure plants. And so we had had teams which

23:48.179 --> 24:02.941
dealt with preparing the coal for the plants, 
feeding the coal to the plants, generating

23:48.179 --> 24:02.941
hydrogen for the plants, the hydrogenation step 
itself, and so on and so forth. So there were dozens

24:02.961 --> 24:13.697
of reports that would cover various aspects of the 
whole operation.

24:14.993 --> 24:21.159
We were well into this, and this investigation ran 
over a period of about six to eight months.

24:21.960 --> 24:23.461
Actually, we got into Germany. I think the first 
trip I made to Germany was either January or

24:23.601 --> 24:29.406
February. Oh, you were in there even as the Allied 
armies were pouring in. Yes, before the war was

24:34.191 --> 24:35.492
over. And in fact, we were into Rhein-Preuysen, 
which was one of the Fisch-Tropsch plans. The

24:44.525 --> 24:47.850
Germans were still on the other side of the river. 
There were still shells coming into the plants.

24:53.059 --> 24:53.820
Not heavily. I wouldn't say we were in any danger or 
anything like that. But we were investigating in

24:58.648 --> 25:00.571
there. And in the evenings, trying to write 
reports and get our notes together and organize as

25:02.173 --> 25:08.964
best we could. That was early. Early 1945, because 
it was cold, the buildings were no heat in the

25:11.609 --> 25:21.143
buildings and no water to take a bath or anything 
like that, we did the best we could. That's all

25:21.203 --> 25:22.285
there was to it. And the investigations then went 
on to about the middle or the autumn of that year

25:23.446 --> 25:36.926
after the war was over, and reports were still 
being issued. I stayed there until about... I

25:39.723 --> 25:41.345
guess about June. I remember when Roosevelt died 
and Truman took over. I listened to that speech in

25:45.911 --> 25:47.714
London. And then a couple of weeks later, I came 
back. So that would have been the latter part of May

25:52.740 --> 25:55.924
that I came back.

25:59.209 --> 26:06.979
Now, I ought to mention one other thing that was two 
or three other things that were done. We

26:09.170 --> 26:18.925
collected all the data and documents that we 
possibly could from the German plants.

26:24.233 --> 26:33.287
We wrote all the reports that we could, and 
oftentimes the teams that got together and

26:24.233 --> 26:33.287
analyzed these reports and made comments and 
suggestions for for revisions, although under

26:33.723 --> 26:38.169
conditions like this, you can't go into a detailed 
report. You do the best you can with the time and

26:38.189 --> 26:45.579
effort that you've got available. And then, as the 
end of this investigating period approached,

26:45.599 --> 27:02.903
I don't know where the suggestion came from, but it 
had generated, I think, in a number of areas,

27:03.558 --> 27:22.226
We thought that it might be a good idea to enlist

27:03.558 --> 27:22.226
the German engineers who had designed and worked 
in the plants and built the plants to actually

27:03.558 --> 27:22.226
write up their own story in German. And I think this 
effort was paid for and organized by the Air Force,

27:24.329 --> 27:30.038
as I remember it. those people, the German people, 
then did set down and write up for the Air Force. And

27:37.904 --> 27:41.009
I believe these reports came out of Dayton. Or 
where is the Air Force? Right, that's in Dayton.

27:44.935 --> 27:47.719
That's the Air Force Institute of Technology. And 
some of those, particularly those reports, were

27:47.939 --> 27:51.945
excellent on coal hydrogenation. And...

28:00.072 --> 28:29.438
I

28:00.072 --> 28:29.438
can't put my finger on mine at the moment because 
they may be moved over here, but there were about 10

28:00.072 --> 28:29.438
or 12 of those reports on coal hydrogenation

28:00.072 --> 28:29.438
that were I'm sure I've got them. Here's Bureau of 
Mines publication on synthetic liquid fuel. No,

28:34.745 --> 28:37.868
those were our own publications, and I have those 
here. But the German part, they're in black

28:39.169 --> 28:44.075
covers.

28:49.761 --> 28:58.750
Reports to the Department of Engineering 
Research.

28:59.641 --> 29:29.614
oh here they are I was looking for them watch your oh 
I'm watching watch your I believe there were eight

28:59.641 --> 29:29.614
or ten volumes of that but this is one of the volumes 
you know and some of them dealt with chemistry and

28:59.641 --> 29:29.614
some of them dealt with engineering and some of 
them dealt with metallurgy and some of them dealt

28:59.641 --> 29:29.614
with the plant structures and so on and so forth And 
then they were all translated into English.

29:35.262 --> 29:37.284
And you ought to have copies of those documents. 
Oh, we'll get them. We'll get them. We'll get them.

29:39.946 --> 29:41.868
You ought to have copies of those documents. We'll 
find a way to... Let me ask you, while I'm looking at

29:41.888 --> 29:57.863
this, would you say that these charts indicate the 
reasonably accurate structure of how the

29:41.888 --> 29:57.863
organization was developed?

30:24.353 --> 30:44.161
How

30:24.353 --> 30:44.161
are you

30:24.353 --> 30:44.161
going to take all these tapes?

30:50.350 --> 30:53.635
Well, you take a couple dozen tapes this time. I was 
going to get about $2,500. That

30:57.835 --> 31:03.304
would be too boxy.

31:34.486 --> 31:50.922
How

31:34.486 --> 31:50.922
do you get on a beep when you have a minute left?

31:50.942 --> 31:52.544
I don't know how many feet run through there. 
Because if it beeps at the end, I mean, you can be

31:52.604 --> 31:55.547
halfway through a word.

31:59.391 --> 32:01.753
Better, I guess, than not even knowing it stopped. 
You've got time. You've got to open it a little.

32:10.413 --> 32:13.029
in that interview with Walton Smith. My gosh, the 
belly.
