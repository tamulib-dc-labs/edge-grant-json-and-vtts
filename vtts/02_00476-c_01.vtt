WEBVTT

00:00.875 --> 00:22.839
line and

00:00.875 --> 00:22.839
we were chipping concrete,

00:00.875 --> 00:22.839
firing on bunkers,

00:00.875 --> 00:22.839
concrete pail boxes and all that kind of stuff. And 
it's a damned expensive way to demolish the

00:24.221 --> 00:30.848
enemy's fortresses.

00:34.034 --> 00:59.417
Okay,

00:34.034 --> 00:59.417
so

00:34.034 --> 00:59.417
you went from Normandy to Leipzig. You met the 
Russian forces, and then you went south in Germany

00:59.836 --> 01:06.945
to where? To

01:06.985 --> 01:28.273
Pilsen, near Pilsen, to west of Pilsen, and not too 
far northeast from Nuremberg.

01:30.700 --> 01:47.957
Then we went from there, pushed up from there up to, 
through the so-called redoubt mountainous

01:30.700 --> 01:47.957
country, up to Pilsen. And

01:47.977 --> 01:59.728
when we got to Pilsen,

02:01.177 --> 02:06.165
was already whipped, withdrawing. Their units 
were dissolving and

02:06.205 --> 02:27.741
the natives were leaving Pilsen in our direction 
rather than toward the enemy or toward the other

02:06.205 --> 02:27.741
way. streaming along the highway out with the guns 
in position, pointed at Pilsen and so forth. So I

02:36.534 --> 02:51.570
got in an airplane and made a little 
reconnaissance over the area, called in and we

02:36.534 --> 02:51.570
also picked up some good maps of Pilsen, city maps. 
They had one of them laid out in a fire control

02:52.291 --> 02:57.036
center and called in the native and says, can you 
show us here on this map where the best brewery is?

03:09.303 --> 03:11.305
Make the best brewery. He put his finger on the 
spot. So we put a pin in the map and got the

03:14.349 --> 03:18.513
coordinates. And my last command to the artillery 
was to draw a thousand meter no fire circle around

03:28.184 --> 03:33.731
these coordinates.

03:37.076 --> 03:40.600
They are the brewery and we expect to be there 
tomorrow. That was my time. You had priorities.

03:45.266 --> 03:45.387
Huh? You had priorities. Damn

03:46.808 --> 03:51.715
right. During the Battle of the Bush

03:58.576 --> 04:07.385
Come look over my shoulder a moment.

04:08.326 --> 04:16.995
This thing was compiled by the decor operations in 
the ETO, 6 January 1942, 9 May 1945. So this gives

04:17.035 --> 04:25.444
the dates and places of... Where your unit was at 
all times. Not only where my unit was, but this is

04:30.719 --> 04:36.745
the core, the zone of action. The whole core. Now 
here, from here down to there was the battle to

04:39.468 --> 04:54.722
expand and establish the lodgement area. this 
thing back to the beach. Now this is for one corps.

05:01.636 --> 05:08.726
Another corps or two landed over here, and the 
British were off up here. So we were the contact

05:09.968 --> 05:20.243
corps with the British all the way along here, and 
now where this narrows down, that's the

05:09.968 --> 05:20.243
breakthrough. As a matter of fact, General,

05:24.082 --> 05:31.773
the general that was killed, what was his name? 
Scotch name.

05:35.518 --> 05:39.684
Gee, I'm terrible on names today, isn't that 
awful?

05:45.012 --> 05:51.962
In the big bombing raid on the breakthrough out of 
the lodgement area,

05:56.127 --> 06:01.351
This guy was superintendent of the command staff 
school while I was out. I was a student there.

06:06.276 --> 06:07.156
It begins with this. Well, anyway, he was killed 
there and there's a lot of damn stories about it.

06:18.766 --> 06:25.712
The battle for the breakout narrowed down here and 
so The hottest fighting was for this little

06:26.738 --> 06:29.942
corridor in here. About twenty miles south of 
Normandy? Well, south of St. Lowe. St. Lowe was the

06:41.156 --> 06:46.803
shoulder that was hard to get past. Got down to 
here, and the fighting from here down was the

06:56.017 --> 06:58.319
German. We had made the breakthrough here for 
Patton. A lot of people think Patton made the

07:04.184 --> 07:08.688
breakthrough. Hell, he didn't pull the trigger at 
the breakthrough. It sure is interesting though

07:13.913 --> 07:25.163
that you spent basically two months just trying to 
make the breakthrough, getting off out of the

07:13.913 --> 07:25.163
Normandy area, and then from August 2nd, down to 
September, just about one month, September 11th,

07:25.818 --> 07:32.864
you were already on the German border over there. 
Well, a lot of things happened there. Patton

07:38.549 --> 07:47.497
didn't come into the lodgement area, into the 
combat zone. He was still back here until about D

07:47.517 --> 07:54.643
plus

07:58.977 --> 08:04.724
When was, oh about July the 20th, somewhere around 
there. I think it was about the time that the

08:05.505 --> 08:25.491
attempt was made on Hitler's

08:05.505 --> 08:25.491
life, and we had that strange broadcast by Lord Ha 
Ha that followed that event. It was just about that

08:26.180 --> 08:31.646
time, I'd say about July the 20th. Now, he came in 
somewhere around that time, about July the 10th,

08:31.666 --> 08:41.658
11th, 12th maybe. Now he took command there of the 
buildup that had been made behind the troops

08:41.678 --> 08:51.749
holding the lodgement area. Then the troops 
holding the lodgement area reinforced by recent

08:55.492 --> 09:02.481
arrivals, made the big effort and made the 
breakthrough here. And you see there's the

09:04.363 --> 09:09.129
headquarters of the 5th Corps right there. It 
moved from down here on the beach where I talked to

09:10.351 --> 09:23.608
Ford, it slipped over to some better quarters near 
Port d'Ambassade and then followed the progress

09:24.297 --> 09:32.847
of the Corps on down to the breakthrough down here 
and this breakthrough was a terrific battle.

09:33.668 --> 09:47.465
There could be no mistake about it because the 
Germans were dug in up to the hilt and it was a rugged

09:33.668 --> 09:47.465
battle from this narrow spot here down to here. Now 
down here at this stage of the game The German 7th

09:53.609 --> 10:17.391
Army,

09:53.609 --> 10:17.391
the 7th Army commander was in command of all the 
troops in France

09:53.609 --> 10:17.391
between, I think his responsibility was about 
here, and down to this line here. Northern France.

10:18.812 --> 10:21.294
North, northwestern France. He had the 
northwestern quarter of France. His zone went way

10:25.917 --> 10:31.663
down here below the Brest Peninsula.

10:31.723 --> 10:42.112
I think his command post was some, you can't read 
the names of the towns on this map, but it's about

10:31.723 --> 10:42.112
probably along there. What about him though? 
Well, the commander of the 7th Army

10:44.915 --> 10:53.383
was scattered down here,

10:54.123 --> 11:07.328
and at the time of our attack, he was having a

10:54.123 --> 11:07.328
staff study. Where's Rems? Rems was long about 
there. Wouldn't that be it?

11:24.312 --> 11:33.303
down along about there, along this axis into 
Marist.

11:33.323 --> 11:37.488
But that's where he was, and then what happened? 
Well, he was down there having a

11:37.508 --> 11:44.796
tactical study. R-E-N-N-E-S? Renz. Yeah, well 
that's it. He was down at Renz. with his Corps

11:52.780 --> 12:04.093
commanders and his...

11:52.780 --> 12:04.093
and this is before D-Day. He has them down there in a 
conference at the time of D-Day. Well now the

12:11.200 --> 12:21.572
commander of the Corps that had the front for 
Normandy, all the way from pretty close to the

12:22.868 --> 12:43.631
British zone at Foutaques, right across northern 
France, was a crippled man and an old

12:22.868 --> 12:43.631
artilleryman, but still on active duty and pretty 
sharp.

12:50.759 --> 12:52.521
He knew that the staff this conference at Renz was 
to discuss the vulnerable points on his front.

13:05.064 --> 13:20.044
And this thing was going to be a sort of a command 
post exercise about what would you do

13:05.064 --> 13:20.044
if the attack were right now. That's what the Army 
commander is asking. Now his front, he's got this

13:24.330 --> 13:37.123
entire northeastern corner of France, including 
the Brest Peninsula, are under his command. So

13:38.064 --> 13:45.472
here he is with his staff, his corps commanders, 
talking about the nitty-gritty. How's the

13:46.733 --> 13:48.815
situation in your area? How's the situation in 
your area? and so forth. And so this damn almost

13:53.919 --> 14:10.578
retired general, he was actually crippled from 
wounds received here, there, yonder, maybe World

13:53.919 --> 14:10.578
War I. He knew that this was going to be the 
discussion So, he says, well, hell, I'm gonna wait

14:16.792 --> 14:23.059
and do something before they ask the vital 
question. So, what he did is he pinched out, he

14:24.441 --> 14:44.605
pulled his,

14:24.441 --> 14:44.605
he pulled his most ready division out of their 
billets and put him up and told him that his

14:46.238 --> 15:02.522
presumption was that his weakest point on the 
coast was between Grand Comte and

14:46.238 --> 15:02.522
Port-en-Bassin. That included, that was 
Normandy Beach, including the cliff that

15:15.719 --> 15:21.045
my friend from the nearby town, the former 
president of the college. Rudder. Rudder. He was

15:25.410 --> 15:28.193
to capture that cliff in our plan. Well, he knew, he 
knew that his weakest point was from Grand Camp

15:29.795 --> 15:43.870
over to some point over here west of over to the area 
that was on the English front. And so he alerted

15:52.540 --> 15:57.829
the—I think I can give you the number of his 
division.

16:00.553 --> 16:04.740
He alerted them. What did you think of when you got 
into Germany? What did you think about the German

16:09.107 --> 16:10.870
people?

16:14.933 --> 16:16.135
Was there a lot of hatred? Not particularly. As a 
matter of fact,

16:20.060 --> 16:30.856
there's an interesting map here and I'll show you 
if I can find it. I haven't looked at this in years.

16:47.789 --> 16:54.900
And it was getting down to our sea here. We're in 
Germany now. Yeah, we're in Germany. So you're

16:59.947 --> 17:01.309
running out of targets. We're running out of 
targets. And when the road was clear for our heavy

17:04.914 --> 17:14.809
artillery to move forward,

17:17.658 --> 17:29.451
They

17:17.658 --> 17:29.451
got to a place called Leipzig. Mm-hmm. Leipzig was 
about to come under our guns. Mm-hmm. Now in

17:35.979 --> 17:37.060
Eastern Germany. Yeah. Mm-hmm. And the...

17:39.683 --> 17:47.091
We had quit there were any targets that appeared on 
the front was being ably handled by the light

17:48.590 --> 18:15.728
artillery and

17:48.590 --> 18:15.728
we were nursing our ammunition and following 
closely behind them and I think it was in, we were in

18:16.990 --> 18:37.716
Gittington, the university town, the night that 
Roosevelt was died, and

18:16.990 --> 18:37.716
that created a big commotion among the

18:46.825 --> 19:10.155
Well, the messenger came back and says it was, to 
me, I was to go to Corps Headquarters, which was in

18:46.825 --> 19:10.155
advance of my own headquarters, and

18:46.825 --> 19:10.155
be at a forenoon staff meeting. And headquarters 
was in a place called Nomberg. and

19:18.803 --> 19:47.612
the officer that brought the orders back

19:18.803 --> 19:47.612
said I was to be at the Corps staff meeting at 
Namburg at 8 o'clock or 9 o'clock Something like

19:47.947 --> 19:48.868
that. And that,

19:50.490 --> 20:03.128
well it didn't say what for, but it says for. What 
was it for? Well it was to tell me that

20:05.511 --> 20:13.422
they were going to move into Leipzig. Take a look at 
this map here.

20:17.883 --> 20:30.198
Here's the corps headquarters at Nomberg and here 
is the close support battalion of the 102nd

20:17.883 --> 20:30.198
Cavalry. That's the regiment that was on their 
flank all the time.

20:39.652 --> 20:41.835
And here's the Soviet Army. Here's the Soviet 
Army. And so you were not more than it looks like a

20:44.379 --> 20:54.675
mile away from them. Well back here at this 
university town,

20:54.695 --> 21:04.309
that's where they caught me. And the fellow that 
brought the orders back was the civilian control

21:05.825 --> 21:14.337
officer. They called him G5. He was in charge of 
relations with the French or whoever the

21:18.242 --> 21:26.855
civilians were. In the area. Yeah. And he was a 
lawyer, still practicing law in Memphis. he

21:35.626 --> 22:05.413
came back and says you're to be at this meeting and 
says I'm supposed to brief you with certain

21:35.626 --> 22:05.413
material here and he says it's highly secret 
yakety yak and but

21:35.626 --> 22:05.413
we're going to capture Leipzig And as you'll find 
in this material, Leipzig is in territory that

22:07.098 --> 22:15.407
belongs to the Russians. And he says the big 
problem is what do you do when you capture a city of

22:17.930 --> 22:32.046
790,000 or close to a million. I think that is about 
that figure. He says it's one thing to liberate. He

22:39.925 --> 22:48.635
says we've been liberating cities in France, but 
ever since then we've been capturing them. He says

22:48.655 --> 22:53.820
now this is the biggest capture that's gonna be 
made in Europe. And he says it's got the old man all

22:55.622 --> 23:00.568
worked up about it. What's he gonna do about it? And 
he says the tentative plan you'll detect in these

23:05.198 --> 23:28.622
sheets of super secret stuff and he says you read 
them tonight and tomorrow have them in your pocket

23:05.198 --> 23:28.622
and give them back to me when you attend this staff 
meeting. Well, he still didn't tell me what I was

23:31.355 --> 23:36.703
getting into because that was the general's job. 
But what it amounted to is that

23:36.723 --> 23:59.235
here on this flank was an armored division and on 
that flank was the sixty 4th Infantry Division,

24:00.953 --> 24:07.179
something like that, some high number, kind of 
Johnny-come-latelys. And they were on this plank

24:08.620 --> 24:20.550
and the 2nd Division, which was one of the landing 
divisions,

24:08.620 --> 24:20.550
was up here. Now these two infantry divisions were 
about to put the clamp on this city of Leipzig. So

24:31.615 --> 24:36.660
the old man was worried about what he was, how he was 
going to come out on it. So his solution was to use

24:38.221 --> 25:00.002
the personnel and equipment of artillery that was 
back behind him and create a task force to move into

24:38.221 --> 25:00.002
the city to grab it ahead of both the American 
troops and the

25:01.028 --> 25:22.974
German troops grab it, take it and hold it until the 
military government people had time to send teams

25:01.028 --> 25:22.974
up to do the usual job. They never dreamed they'd 
capture anything as big as this and they had no

25:23.574 --> 25:30.242
teams set up to do it. So they said, we'll create a 
task force to go in there and grab this area and

25:31.606 --> 25:42.684
police it. They'll have bulldozers enough to get 
the rubble out of the streets and to knock over any

25:42.744 --> 25:56.106
petty barriers. And he says, Where do we get the 
task force? He says, well, I'll take two or three or

26:01.554 --> 26:10.607
four or six artillery battalion regiments. He 
says, like the 190th and so on and so forth. And he

26:15.994 --> 26:18.598
says, we'll create a task force hill. You see, he's 
put that label in the city. And he says, task force

26:24.706 --> 26:28.191
hill will be reinforced by anything that he wants 
that isn't already lying in the presence of the

26:29.167 --> 26:42.380
existing enemy and looking through sights at him. 
He says, the city is blossoming with white flags.

26:49.067 --> 26:50.348
It's a surrender job. But how do we get it? Because 
between the time One army pulls out and the other

26:56.352 --> 27:00.396
bar moves in. There's a completely lawless 
condition and the civilians kill one another if

27:01.737 --> 27:16.410
they've got a bitter enemy that day and there's no 
authority, no nothing. So he wanted the old

27:17.611 --> 27:24.857
general solution was right on the heels of the 
second division. and on the heels of the 64th

27:26.153 --> 27:54.844
Division, right on their heels, would be 
truck-borne personnel and equipment and men to

27:26.153 --> 27:54.844
move in and grab the city hall, grab every place, 
the police station, grab everything, invite the

27:26.153 --> 27:54.844
surrender all the anti-aircraft, my God, the 
anti-aircraft defenses around this town looked

27:55.280 --> 28:07.975
like a hedgehog pointing up. They'd shot up most of 
their ammunition though, offered no resistance

28:09.157 --> 28:14.103
to us. And it says, these following Task

28:15.344 --> 28:24.055
Force Hill will engulf the city. and grab 
everything before there's a reaction. So that's

28:29.673 --> 28:30.594
what you did? That's what I did. You moved down and 
took it. Now were the people, how did the people

28:34.899 --> 28:37.763
react to you? I know they wanted to surrender, but I 
mean was there any resistance, any sniping? Some

28:43.490 --> 28:44.912
sniping, very little. Were they fearful of the 
Russians? You're damn right they were. They

28:51.700 --> 28:53.923
wanted you to take the city before the Russians? to 
surrender. Now you can see there was already— The

28:57.598 --> 29:02.344
Russians are right there, it looks like, a couple 
of miles away. Well, on their front at the time I

29:03.706 --> 29:17.384
moved in, there was still one battalion, one 
regiment, another battalion, another

29:03.706 --> 29:17.384
battalion.

29:21.088 --> 29:22.290
There were remnants

29:25.578 --> 29:30.866
of those battalions and two divisions up here in 
the north. Those two divisions were gonna be

29:32.649 --> 29:42.584
contained by the second division as it moved up hot 
on their heels. So these two divisions could be

29:42.824 --> 29:48.853
written off the books as a threat to a fight for the 
city. So we were to go in and act as a,

29:55.362 --> 30:02.835
act as a team. And they asked me what did I want and so 
forth. I hadn't time enough to think the thing

30:08.364 --> 30:20.965
through between the time that I was briefed by this 
Memphis lawyer.

30:23.206 --> 30:41.746
So I had time to think it through and I decided to 
take not only my own three battalions, I had three

30:23.206 --> 30:41.746
battalions, organic then, but I decided to ask for 
the...

30:48.033 --> 30:53.179
I saw no reason why I should go in there with one 
regiment. and I could just as easily have three

30:54.188 --> 30:57.653
regiments. So I said, well, so I had my mind made up. 
He says, well, what do you think? I said, well, I

31:05.283 --> 31:21.706
think the 190th could do a pretty good job by 
themselves, but I don't know why we should be up

31:05.283 --> 31:21.706
there clearing the muck out of their damn streets 
with these other two regiments sitting back here

31:05.283 --> 31:21.706
on their fanny. And I says, I'd like to have the 
166th,

31:24.580 --> 31:44.920
and I says, I'd like to have one battalion of 
engineers complete with equipment for clearing

31:24.580 --> 31:44.920
the streets and meeting the disasters here. What 
was the condition of the city? Well, it was shot to

31:48.003 --> 31:50.385
hell pretty bad. And I told him everything I 
wanted. I wanted a battalion of engineers and

31:53.230 --> 32:10.874
another battalion, I wanted a field battalion, a 
medical corps, and there's another battalion. So

32:12.456 --> 32:17.503
what I carried, that's Force Hill, let's see. 
might be listed in

32:19.576 --> 32:25.542
this. I don't know. Did you and your men actually 
bump into the Russians then? Yeah, there were a few

32:30.367 --> 32:32.849
Russians. For always, you run into a Russian,

32:34.791 --> 32:48.064
the minute that the enemy fades from the When these 
German divisions, when they found themselves

32:49.445 --> 33:02.785
with their back to the river and the Russians on the 
other side of the river, they began turning in

32:49.445 --> 33:02.785
their weapons. And so stragglers from those 
people over there naturally began showing up and

33:04.648 --> 33:18.068
we immediately grabbed them and put them in a 
stockade.

33:18.773 --> 33:46.992
We took over the police force in Leipzig, and of 
course we captured the chief of police, locked him

33:18.773 --> 33:46.992
up, put him and his top people in due rest vial, and 
told the rest of the police, somebody's got to keep

33:18.773 --> 33:46.992
some law and order around here, and if We're going 
to expect your help and your full cooperation and

33:48.507 --> 34:01.724
you're going to help us mop up your city and help you 
save as much of it as we can. Now I talked to junior

34:03.366 --> 34:05.829
captains. I talked to the chief of police, but I was 
too, we had already made the decision that anybody

34:16.672 --> 34:32.088
with a command authority that fell into our hands 
was not only relieved of his command authority,

34:16.672 --> 34:32.088
but was a prisoner of war, period. And went right 
back to the prisoner of war center.

34:43.920 --> 34:45.582
What did you think of the Russians when you met 
them? Well, I met them in another place. I met them

34:49.857 --> 35:08.836
down in Czechoslovakia

34:49.857 --> 35:08.836
and I got on very cordial relations with a 
lieutenant general commanding the, oddly

34:49.857 --> 35:08.836
enough, the 5th Corps Guards. I don't know what the 
guards were. I guess it was normal Russian

35:16.257 --> 35:19.681
division. But that's another story. Let's say 
I've already talked you down for quite a bit.

35:35.057 --> 35:40.063
Maybe we better knock off

35:35.057 --> 35:40.063
at one o'clock. The guys I saw were under very 
favorable circumstances.

35:48.235 --> 36:16.504
And our first trouble with them, we met them in

35:48.235 --> 36:16.504
Czechoslovakia, not at Pilsen, per se, because 
we, in a rural sort of way, continued to do the same

35:48.235 --> 36:16.504
thing in Czechoslovakia that we had done in

36:20.163 --> 36:43.345
in Leipzig, and that is make friendship with the 
civilian authorities, get their police force out

36:20.163 --> 36:43.345
of jail or wherever they were, activate them, 
extract

36:20.163 --> 36:43.345
from them top key men in the city government. Now, 
we were always, and this was a handicap, we were

36:44.486 --> 36:49.731
under. These ignorant bastards back in places 
like Paris thought that they knew everything and

36:50.875 --> 37:00.947
they'd write directives to do this and do that. But 
when you're on the ground and you're trying to

37:02.468 --> 37:10.618
achieve an objective... It's a lot different. You 
better accept the cooperation of anybody that

37:12.780 --> 37:18.807
volunteers his cooperation. the fact that the guy 
comes in hat in hand and says it's all over. Now,

37:26.918 --> 37:46.583
we

37:26.918 --> 37:46.583
disarmed all the top policemen in Lapsing and If a 
guy was wearing a weapon bigger than a club, or more

37:47.761 --> 37:56.935
dangerous than a club, what the hell are you doing 
with that? They took it away from him. On the spot,

37:59.299 --> 38:08.273
the first American that saw him

37:59.299 --> 38:08.273
said, I want the weapon. And the guy would 
sometimes say, for a souvenir. says yes, and hand

38:14.828 --> 38:23.270
it to me right now, and then pull out the gun and lay 
it on him. You can't, in dealing with an armed man,

38:23.290 --> 38:30.188
and you're armed, you can't fool with him. Now, you 
remained on active duty until February 1946, and

38:32.497 --> 38:44.451
at February 1946 you were separated. You were a 
colonel at this time, is that right? Yeah. And you

38:47.955 --> 39:01.031
were, had you given any thought at all to remaining 
in the service and making a career out of it, or did

38:47.955 --> 39:01.031
you want to go back and be a college president 
again? I thought of that a lot.

39:04.913 --> 39:10.722
The, uh,

39:04.913 --> 39:10.722
in the first place. Here, have this. Well, say, 
that's yours. No, no, no. I'm not going to drink it.

39:15.991 --> 39:26.528
You go ahead

39:15.991 --> 39:26.528
and drink. This helps my memory on everything 
except names. Names are terrible. So you had

39:33.331 --> 39:36.337
thought about staying in the service? I never 
intended to stay in the service a day in my life. Oh,

39:41.849 --> 39:42.310
okay. So you did not think then, let's get this 
straight, you did not think? I did not play with the

39:46.399 --> 39:48.483
idea at all. You wanted to go back and be a college 
student?

40:00.618 --> 40:03.341
plus the freedom and the enjoyment. Okay, so you 
left the service. Now, the other question I wanted

40:06.004 --> 40:12.372
to ask you was when were you promoted to general?

40:15.155 --> 40:18.359
Well... To brigadier general. You were promoted 
to major general in the early 1950s. Well, in the

40:24.646 --> 40:27.790
same manner that I never was a first lieutenant. 
Oh, in 1946, you were promoted to Major General of

40:29.018 --> 40:37.209
the 32nd Division of the Wisconsin National 
Guard. Yeah. Okay. So you never were promoted to a

40:40.093 --> 40:42.616
one-star general. No. You just skipped that. 
Yeah, just in a cavalier manner. And the governor

40:50.767 --> 40:53.191
then promoted you to the Major General. No. The 
governor had nothing. Okay, who did? The...

41:02.026 --> 41:25.407
There's an awful lot of

41:02.026 --> 41:25.407
mixed up imagination in people's minds about the, 
the

41:02.026 --> 41:25.407
governor cannot, a governor can appoint any golf 
of friend he wants to a colonel. And he can promote

41:27.369 --> 41:31.493
him to brigadier general or whatever, whatever he 
wants to. But he's not a federally recognized

41:32.587 --> 41:38.234
officer, see? So a promotion without federal 
recognition. I was promoted from second

41:48.548 --> 41:58.982
lieutenant to captain because It was to the best 
interest of the National Guard of Wisconsin, the

41:59.890 --> 42:08.059
federally recognized National Guard. Every unit 
was federally recognized and every man in it was

42:09.981 --> 42:19.431
subject to the active duty militia. That's what 
the National Guard is. Someday when you got

42:23.375 --> 42:27.079
nothing else to do, you can read the sorriest book 
and the hardest book I ever wrote, and it's the,

42:28.848 --> 42:48.484
I

42:28.848 --> 42:48.484
think the official title is, we had a hell of a big 
argument over the title. You always have an

42:50.227 --> 42:52.611
argument with the publisher

43:05.804 --> 43:11.893
I wrote this

43:05.804 --> 43:11.893
book lying around here somewhere.

43:15.177 --> 43:16.279
The Texas Navy? Sea Dogs of the Sixties? No, I guess 
that—by the way, my departure

43:19.964 --> 43:30.659
from Lou's in 1967—pretty good story. You were 
appointed a two-star general. What were your

43:35.808 --> 43:37.031
functions? What were you in charge of? I was in 
charge of all of the planning of the training of the

43:38.434 --> 43:46.171
division. It's barracks status and it's home 
station status.

43:57.610 --> 43:58.331
collectively. And at camp, of course, we had field 
training there. And I was in command then. And I'm

44:08.006 --> 44:10.770
telling you, we could do just about as much.

44:14.255 --> 44:24.951
The only thing that the biggest handicap of the 
Guard, say, is the Guard a 100% ready

44:14.255 --> 44:24.951
organization.

44:27.192 --> 44:35.044
When it comes to knowledge and know-how, they are 
as 100% ready as anybody in the regulars. And most

44:37.147 --> 44:44.178
of them have at least, are at least graduates of 
their arms college. Fort Sill, all that stuff,

44:45.160 --> 44:49.707
see.

44:53.180 --> 45:14.059
they have their big handicap is that the 
personnel, officers and men, are not in a physical

44:53.180 --> 45:14.059
condition to go into the field and go into a real 
hard fight.

45:16.942 --> 45:20.385
Now, the beauty about the training that we had

45:25.377 --> 45:30.371
in which the entire training of the regiment was in 
my hands. There was nobody looking over my

45:32.477 --> 45:37.952
shoulder telling me what to do.
