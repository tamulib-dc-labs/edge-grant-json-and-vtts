WEBVTT

00:03.406 --> 00:07.330
when they first had their P.E. program the 
instructor came in and told them there's no ladies

00:07.410 --> 00:19.463
rooms here we're going to have to go meet in the 
library so that was their start of P.E. but tales of

00:21.125 --> 00:27.692
being harassed going to school that they had have 
their heels kicked and their toes stepped on by

00:28.364 --> 00:35.073
fellas in the corps saying, why don't you go to TWU? 
You don't belong here with us. So they had to put up

00:37.336 --> 00:39.499
with a lot of that initially. But after those, what 
I think, relatively few instances, it was all for

00:40.701 --> 00:51.656
the best and accepted. What about the reception of 
that first female faculty member? How was she

00:56.275 --> 00:59.359
received in the department and in the college, as 
you recall? In the college pretty well, and I think

00:59.379 --> 01:05.225
in the college pretty well as far as committee 
assignments and things go. But that was a relative

01:05.245 --> 01:07.468
rarity, too. As you look back on it, did you all hire 
her in an affirmative action posture because she

01:08.249 --> 01:17.219
was female, or did you hire her because she was the 
best person? No, I wanted her to cover the

01:17.320 --> 01:21.945
community recreation aspects that we wanted to 
do. I don't remember honestly if that was a rear

01:23.782 --> 01:35.355
guard action against health and physical 
education or something we wanted to do anyway.

01:35.595 --> 01:43.745
In those early years, did you run up into any brick 
walls, any obstacles that were difficult to get

01:35.595 --> 01:43.745
around in the department's growth and progress? 
No. In fact, I think among some of the people, I was a

01:45.406 --> 01:52.995
constant irritant. We were growing fast. Rutter 
supported us every time. I don't know if he told...

01:58.041 --> 02:10.637
You know, you have to remember, over in the Koch 
building, when I came here, the whole

01:58.041 --> 02:10.637
administrative structure of the university 
could sit in one room. I think they had like 46

02:10.677 --> 02:12.880
chairs in there. President Rutter had three 
assistants. The academic council would be all the

02:19.108 --> 02:22.712
deans, all the department heads. and Andy Suttle 
as research I think and some Graf or Goff or

02:23.148 --> 02:48.683
something Bill Graf as academics undergraduate 
academics that was all there was and so we were a

02:23.148 --> 02:48.683
pretty tight group little bunch and I remember 
President Rutter who was a very stout man getting

02:23.148 --> 02:48.683
up one day and saying I'm just your old pot-bellied 
president. He said, you fellas make the decisions

02:50.486 --> 02:54.694
about what to teach. I'll just go get you the money. 
Kind of an earthy, down to earth kind of a guy with no

02:57.400 --> 03:04.153
pretensions about academic stuff. And it 
operated pretty well like that in terms of getting

03:04.174 --> 03:08.342
approval. So I was able to get the courses We were 
always building a curriculum, and most of the

03:11.292 --> 03:17.639
early courses I taught myself the first time, 
breaking them in. It seems wonderful to have that

03:18.860 --> 03:23.205
much time available at that time. And another 
thing, Haskell, this is out of context, but I'm

03:24.286 --> 03:28.511
proud of several things. We had one of the first 
girls as an undergraduate. We had the first girl

03:32.535 --> 03:37.100
graduate in the Corps. And I had the first black 
varsity member of the football team. Who was it?

03:47.288 --> 03:47.688
J.T. Thomas. Oh yes. He went into the National Park 
Service along with Dabney, and he also had some of

03:49.031 --> 04:07.303
these experiences you know of the football 
players rubbing his hair for good luck before a

03:49.031 --> 04:07.303
game, but he stuck it out and earned his letter with 
the football team. So those were pretty

04:09.870 --> 04:13.256
significant changes along the way, too. Now, with 
the support you enjoyed from President Rutter and

04:14.077 --> 04:22.632
so forth, did any of your colleagues ever accuse 
you and the department of being his pets? Yes. How

04:24.675 --> 04:26.358
was that made known? How was that expressed? Oh,

04:27.620 --> 04:32.328
I don't know. Just bantering, I guess.

04:36.680 --> 04:39.483
I don't think we were ever given anything that we 
didn't work for. And in recognition of what we did,

04:40.343 --> 04:47.010
somebody always made it possible to move to 
another place. Went from the plant science

04:47.090 --> 04:49.252
building to the heap building. From the heap 
building, as I grew, we couldn't get any other

04:50.673 --> 04:56.399
place together and started fragmenting. And 
finally, I had people in the old bioscience

04:56.499 --> 05:03.005
building. You remember where that was? before the 
new one was built, had four or five offices there.

05:13.685 --> 05:17.050
I think we were in five different buildings during 
that time. And it finally got to me because we had a

05:18.151 --> 05:25.582
secretary that took mail around to all these 
different places. And one day I looked for this

05:26.643 --> 05:32.151
particular secretary and she didn't come back 
until almost noon. kind of reamed her out because I

05:32.705 --> 05:39.996
thought that she'd been just off having lunch or 
something somewhere. And she said, no, Dr.

05:40.016 --> 05:45.884
So-and-so sent me to get his laundry, his cleaning 
over at the laundry. Well, that did it. And I said,

05:47.967 --> 05:50.771
we got to get back into a single place. And 
fortunately, and I know this was in 70,

05:51.813 --> 06:02.408
was able to bargain our way into the horse barn. The 
horse barn at that time was up for demolition,

06:03.265 --> 06:06.509
Garrigan's barn. It had been used for an extension 
warehouse for undistributed publications. And

06:14.539 --> 06:20.347
then there was a proposal to make it the golf 
headquarters. Who had built the golf course in 51?

06:23.991 --> 06:24.592
You were here. No, no, not in 51, 59 for me. Oh, well, 
51 I think the golf course was first built. and they

06:32.780 --> 06:55.834
wanted to have the horse barn be the golf clubhouse 
and sales office and everything and president

06:32.780 --> 06:55.834
rudder asked me and i argued against it i said it's 
it's a good building to make a good academic

06:32.780 --> 06:55.834
building i'd like to be in there The other side of 
the coin is I think it's dangerous to have people

06:57.097 --> 07:05.951
with golf carts and walking back and forth from 
this side of the road to get to the golf course.

07:06.852 --> 07:19.552
Well, they eventually approved me moving into 
there and gave us a massive amount of money, I think

07:06.852 --> 07:19.552
$130,000 to renovate it for offices and 
classrooms and laboratories. And every student,

07:20.573 --> 07:24.960
to my knowledge, that was in that building, in the 
old horse barn during the two years we were there,

07:25.261 --> 07:32.525
considers that the salad days of the department. 
The upstairs was, unlivable but the wives came in

07:36.432 --> 08:04.954
with bandanas around their head and they scrubbed 
and cleaned I rassled up enough surplus furniture

07:36.432 --> 08:04.954
to put offices office furniture and desks up there 
for them we finally made a faculty conference area

07:36.432 --> 08:04.954
up there and that was one happy family that 
department at that time in fact curious thing

07:36.432 --> 08:04.954
people will organize no matter what you do they 
like structure and I realized after we were in

08:05.288 --> 08:33.017
there about in the first year six months nine 
months that there was a structure going as new

08:05.288 --> 08:33.017
students came in they had to have a desk on this side 
of the upstairs loft each semester as somebody

08:05.288 --> 08:33.017
graduated they were allowed to move up one desk 
toward the other end as far as I could tell there was

08:05.288 --> 08:33.017
no difference in the air conditioning or the view 
or the lights or anything else but You could move up

08:34.280 --> 08:39.227
until finally you were the senior grad students on 
the other end of that room. But that was a good place

08:40.189 --> 08:43.834
except we outgrew it so rapidly. Now, during those 
years, did you or anyone else attempt any kind of

08:45.056 --> 08:56.653
social events to pull the department's parts 
together? We did a lot of that. Describe those,

08:57.835 --> 08:59.157
please.

09:03.203 --> 09:31.911
Well, we had receptions every semester for the 
graduating students, and Dorothy and I, bless her

09:03.203 --> 09:31.911
heart, we did those initially at our house, 
borrowed card tables from all around the

09:03.203 --> 09:31.911
neighborhood, and invited both the graduating 
students plus their spouse or girlfriend and

09:03.203 --> 09:31.911
parents, if they were in town, to come to that. We 
had them in every room of the house, cooked for

09:32.996 --> 09:36.942
them.

09:41.388 --> 09:58.954
In the very first year or so, I bought a lot out at 
Carter Lake, intending, that's only three or four

09:41.388 --> 09:58.954
miles out of town to the south here, intending to 
build a summer place for us that's on a hill where

09:41.388 --> 09:58.954
you could look and see the campus from the top of 
that hill. And monthly, I took all the students in

10:02.097 --> 10:08.964
the department out there for a wiener roast on the 
bank of that little 50-acre lake. A couple of the

10:10.245 --> 10:16.551
Dabney brothers, for example, played 12-string 
guitars. We'd just sing cowboy songs and have a

10:16.611 --> 10:19.093
good old time.

10:22.337 --> 10:29.083
We organized a recreation and park student club 
right away. And another thing I tried to do that was

10:30.143 --> 10:42.334
very successful, when I got here, A&M was 
organized, and you've been here so you know this,

10:30.143 --> 10:42.334
on the basis of class ring year. Like President 
Rutter was 32, class of 32, and somebody else 37 or

10:44.195 --> 10:49.880
43 or whatever. And I saw that as a layer cake. And I 
said, you know, in our department, The faculty

11:00.080 --> 11:01.622
bought into this. We want to have a layer cake, but a 
slice of cake. It doesn't matter what year they

11:06.649 --> 11:13.879
are, freshman to senior or graduate, they're all 
part of the department. And so I tried not to do away

11:13.899 --> 11:23.052
with the class ring year, but to emphasize the 
departmental affiliation. And I'll tell you what

11:23.933 --> 11:25.915
that did, Haskell. It developed into a national 
network where our students when they graduated,

11:30.050 --> 11:35.116
would recommend other students to come here or 
would hire our graduates. And that's still going

11:36.337 --> 11:37.678
on. So that's a little sidelined. What kind of 
get-togethers did you have for the faculty and

11:41.543 --> 11:44.887
staff? We had Christmas parties.

11:50.533 --> 11:53.136
Probably too many parties of different stuff. We 
had noontime domino tournaments.

12:01.893 --> 12:07.218
You know, for those that didn't want to go out to 
eat, just sat around and would kibitz or play

12:01.893 --> 12:07.218
dominoes.

12:10.842 --> 12:20.511
We invited the secretarial staff to these kind of 
things, and I think that made them feel more a part

12:10.842 --> 12:20.511
of the thing as well. As things were developing, 
when did you begin to feel that you were making

12:21.392 --> 12:28.879
national impact? people were beginning to 
recognize what was happening here. By 1970? Five

12:35.366 --> 12:35.887
years? Four years? Well, I was elected president 
of our national association, the Society of Park

12:37.268 --> 12:47.801
and Recreation Educators, which was about 600 
members. Because, you know, we didn't have a

12:49.403 --> 12:52.586
product to sell. We didn't Let me go back a little 
ways. You mentioned Texas Tech. Texas Tech owned

12:57.190 --> 13:00.955
the Parks and Wildlife Department. They had been 
feeding, they started in 52. So they had a 15 year

13:03.760 --> 13:06.303
head start on us. And they had consequently 
mid-career graduates in there and they wouldn't

13:07.545 --> 13:12.673
hire any Aggies. They wanted They'd go to extremes 
to get graduates at Texas Tech into the Parks and

13:14.641 --> 13:20.297
Wildlife. We had a very hard time busting into 
that, and we eventually did.

13:28.218 --> 13:29.241
Why did I say that? Why is that relevant? about 
making the mark and being recognized i saw because

13:31.178 --> 13:58.958
we didn't have students out in these agencies i saw 
my role largely nationally as a tub thumper and so i

13:31.178 --> 13:58.958
went to all these meetings and probably made a 
nuisance of myself talking about all the good

13:31.178 --> 13:58.958
things that were happening at a m they couldn't 
discount us because we had the full professors who

13:31.178 --> 13:58.958
had good reputations in their own fields and they 
were on the programs and all of that kind of stuff if

13:59.461 --> 14:28.540
we'd had to start with assistant profs and 
instructors we couldn't have done that so we were I

13:59.461 --> 14:28.540
think pretty successful in getting people out and 
known and visible around the country and that fed

13:59.461 --> 14:28.540
us if you look at our early enrollments

13:59.461 --> 14:28.540
most of our undergraduates were Texas kids Most of 
our graduate students were out of state. They were

14:32.846 --> 14:38.893
here, usually hated it, didn't like the weather or 
anything, and then they left as soon as they got the

14:32.846 --> 14:38.893
degree. But they wanted the degree from A&M. And so 
that helped as far as this national reputation. So

14:47.763 --> 14:54.050
that by 10 years, we were recognized 
internationally as well as nationally. But you

14:55.112 --> 14:58.035
see, when did President Rutter die? 70, wasn't it? 
That was critical, those first five formative

15:00.633 --> 15:03.698
years. I did try to deliver what he'd ask of us, and I 
think we got there, but I so often wish that he'd

15:04.699 --> 15:16.416
remained another five years or so. Do you recall 
any time whenever he said to you in any fashion,

15:17.898 --> 15:26.952
made some comment that you were producing what he 
hoped you would? Yeah, yeah. Do you remember? No,

15:31.364 --> 15:41.799
there was just always that feeling of support and a 
pat on the back with him. And you know, perhaps he

15:42.100 --> 15:45.865
did the same with everybody. I don't know. But I 
always felt that, just confident of his support.

15:51.427 --> 15:56.994
Now, did he ever kind of accost you about anything? 
You didn't do this or didn't do that. No, he laughed

16:01.579 --> 16:18.920
at me one time because, again, in trying to get more 
visibility on the campus, we had what was like, at

16:01.579 --> 16:18.920
Michigan State had been called Farmer's Week with 
a lot of displays and equipment companies and seed

16:01.579 --> 16:18.920
companies and all of that. And we had something 
similar. here every spring where all the

16:21.329 --> 16:32.858
departments put up a display and staffed it with 
students over in DeWare Field House.

16:34.154 --> 16:43.408
One year I remember I, this is largely for high 
school kids coming to persuade them to come to A&M

16:34.154 --> 16:43.408
after they graduated. One year I got the faculty 
with me and we went over with several camp stoves,

16:45.091 --> 16:52.062
kerosene camp stoves, And we cooked pancakes for 
all comers. Well, nobody had ever done anything

16:54.805 --> 16:56.989
like this. I mean, you know, these were scholarly. 
And I caught help from my department head friends

16:59.294 --> 17:07.712
in agriculture for turning this into a circus. 
That was one year. This was three years in a row.

17:12.138 --> 17:14.703
They didn't like the pancakes and the tents and 
stuff. We were doing a display on outdoor camping.

17:17.429 --> 17:20.354
Well, what's more sensible than cooking? But 
instead of just pretending to cook pancakes, we

17:20.976 --> 17:29.372
actually cooked them, put syrup on them, and gave 
them to all the kids and all the people and the

17:20.976 --> 17:29.372
mothers coming by. Second year, I got a 
all-terrain vehicle, one of these little

17:29.926 --> 17:45.421
four-wheel kind of things from downtown at the 
equipment company, and came out, and we gave rides

17:29.926 --> 17:45.421
to the kids and to their parents. And I remember one 
Texas mommy with her big hairdo, and she wanted to

17:45.521 --> 17:59.494
ride in that thing, and she had a tight hobble skirt 
on, and trying to get up over and into that was a

17:45.521 --> 17:59.494
comedy, but she wanted to ride in that thing. That 
didn't go over very good, riding kids around out of

18:00.149 --> 18:04.537
doors. The third year,

18:04.637 --> 18:16.279
I made 3,000 of these for just a few dollars. And it 
said TMU, Click with Recreation and Parks. And I

18:21.589 --> 18:23.473
gave one of these to, every kid had a basket that 
came to our little display and the kids would come,

18:23.875 --> 18:28.996
where's the clickers, where's the clickers? And I 
don't know if it'll even click anymore. Well, I

18:34.186 --> 18:36.209
heard about that from the bus drivers. They said, 
whoever gave these damn things to these kids, they

18:36.269 --> 18:41.477
drove me nuts all the way home in the bus. Don't let 
them do that anymore. So that's what President

18:43.781 --> 18:46.104
Rutter laughed at me about. He said, you know, 
you've done some highly unorthodox thing, and

18:46.786 --> 18:55.038
I've heard from some of your colleagues over there 
in agriculture that you're turning it into a

18:46.786 --> 18:55.038
circus. And I said, yeah, but we're getting 
students from high school. Now, he died somewhat

18:58.223 --> 19:02.590
close to 30 years ago right now. Do you recall any of 
your last conversation or anything with him? No.

19:11.991 --> 19:24.966
Actually, I was at a conference at Galveston

19:11.991 --> 19:24.966
when we got news that he had died suddenly of a 
stroke. One month before his 60th birthday. Good

19:29.448 --> 19:29.669
grief. So he did not qualify for his veteran's 
benefits. Is that right? And Congressman Olin

19:34.835 --> 19:43.306
Teague, his classmate, chairman of the Veterans 
Affairs Committee at that time, could not get an

19:34.835 --> 19:43.306
exception made. How tragic. Well, I remember 
being absolutely stunned, and I think his name

19:46.310 --> 19:51.156
was, Butcher, Vice President of University of 
Texas, had a plane there and agreed to have me come

19:53.093 --> 20:07.666
with him back to A&M. So we flew back the same 
afternoon that we got the news. He had a push-pull

20:12.533 --> 20:16.578
plane, one with a propeller on each end. And we flew 
back together talking about that and the

20:17.419 --> 20:23.626
implications that this meant for the school and 
for the state. And can I say something that I hope

20:24.867 --> 20:30.053
you'll delete from this?

20:33.577 --> 20:35.720
We were talking about Mr. Rutter's death. He is 
succeeded that fall by Jack Williams. And in a year

20:42.419 --> 20:50.911
or so, Vice President for Academic Affairs, as we 
then called it, Horace Byers, is succeeded by John

20:42.419 --> 20:50.911
Calhoun. When those two men came into the 
administration, did that change in any way the

20:51.852 --> 21:04.950
momentum that you all had underway in Recreation 
and Parks?

21:11.495 --> 21:13.678
Were they supportive of the efforts y'all? I think 
we were established well enough that it didn't

21:14.099 --> 21:20.889
make a whole lot of difference. We weren't, you 
know, personally under the wing of President

21:20.989 --> 21:28.361
Rutter anymore. But you're implying that you 
didn't need to be. We didn't need to be because we

21:32.126 --> 21:37.114
matured enough, I guess, to have people on the 
graduate faculty advisory committee and this and

21:37.870 --> 22:06.291
that kind of committee and so on and we had moved out 
of the horse barn to goodwin hall which was i think a

21:37.870 --> 22:06.291
major advantage

21:37.870 --> 22:06.291
and we were there quite a long time right next to the 
administration building

22:10.405 --> 22:20.983
I forget how many years, quite a long time Haskell, 
because that was supposed to be torn down, but we

22:10.405 --> 22:20.983
could talk all afternoon about the stories of life 
in that place. Share a few of them. Well, the

22:24.910 --> 22:31.401
building was old and supposed to be knocked down 
and it housed the four departments of business.

22:33.659 --> 22:43.938
whatever they were, and I was able to get on the, you 
know you had to plan about three years in advance to

22:33.659 --> 22:43.938
get a move to another building. And at one point I 
was, you know you talk about my relations on the

22:43.958 --> 22:54.537
campus, when we get in these department head 
meetings some of the guys would say, know

22:55.192 --> 23:17.706
somebody's got to put a noose about this reed he's 
going to surround the damn campus and he'll own all

22:55.192 --> 23:17.706
of it because i was here and there and peace pieces 
of department in a lot of different places but but

22:55.192 --> 23:17.706
goodwin hall put us back together in a good central 
location i liked it right there on the drill field

22:55.192 --> 23:17.706
and uh the way the building was constructed, 
apparently it was built in two sections with a wing

23:18.918 --> 23:36.077
added on it and that wing never really fit with the 
rest of the building and they tended to hate each

23:18.918 --> 23:36.077
other and they'd come apart and go back together 
depending on the earth and how much moisture there

23:18.918 --> 23:36.077
was in the ground. And they had it cabled together 
to keep it from falling apart. And more than once

23:40.522 --> 23:46.309
I'd come back from somewhere and I'd find all my 
secretaries out on the other side of the street

23:47.183 --> 23:49.025
arms akimbo and looking at it. I said, what's the 
matter? Was it a bomb threat? And they said, no, no,

23:51.067 --> 23:55.111
all the telephone wires in the building snapped. 
It moved apart like this and the wires that were

23:55.491 --> 24:00.976
taught would actually break. So they'd have to 
come in and re-cable the building. But we loved it.

24:07.623 --> 24:10.265
It had half a level below ground level. It had 
windows, but they were short windows and the floor

24:14.875 --> 24:22.625
was like four or five feet below ground level, and I 
put all the grad students down there, and they

24:14.875 --> 24:22.625
called it the sump. It was the sump where they said, 
there was a sign that said, where all the dirt and

24:22.645 --> 24:29.173
filth doth collect. But that was their area, you 
know, and if the faculty wanted to see them on their

24:31.276 --> 24:36.563
own terms, they had to go to the sump. So we had our 
own classrooms, we had our own offices, and that

24:37.471 --> 24:46.240
was really attractive. And then, no, I misspoke 
myself. That had oceanography and something else

24:50.825 --> 24:53.548
in that building. When I was able to move them to 
this building after Goodwin, this is where the

24:54.269 --> 25:02.077
different business took place. Here in Francis 
Hall. In Francis. And this was actually, that's

25:05.078 --> 25:17.211
where I had my first serious wrist slap because I 
had gotten on, I'd always been on good terms with

25:05.078 --> 25:17.211
the physical plant. I knew how important that was 
to get on their scheduling list years ahead. And so

25:22.457 --> 25:33.229
from Goodwin, I wanted this building when the 
business people vacated and also negotiated for

25:22.457 --> 25:33.229
the second floor of next door where archaeology 
is. Then, in

25:37.595 --> 25:48.053
the early 90s, I guess, other programs were 
building. There was some talk about A&M could no

25:50.523 --> 26:03.880
longer maintain all the different, we had to cut 
back on the number of degrees and the number of

25:50.523 --> 26:03.880
departments and the number of disciplines and 
focus on those that clearly had the potential of

25:50.523 --> 26:03.880
being national. We thought we were, by then, well 
proven as national programs, but still didn't

26:04.081 --> 26:14.374
rate like the more traditional disciplines. So I 
lost the second floor where we had planned to have

26:17.624 --> 26:29.019
all of our extension built, but I was able to 
maintain this entire building even though there

26:17.624 --> 26:29.019
was a movement to take part of this way too. That was 
my last gift to the department. About when did you

26:32.564 --> 26:34.987
move into this building, into Francis? I can't 
even tell you. Ten years ago? Yeah, around 90

26:38.632 --> 26:45.741
or 91, something like that. As the progress was 
going on in the 70s and then in the 80s, are there

26:46.582 --> 26:57.568
such things as national rankings of programs? 
Yes. Yeah, well, that's what helped because I was

26:58.410 --> 27:01.317
able to bring bring back and still have somewhere 
in my local archives the and actually obviously I

27:02.123 --> 27:28.030
was very quick to send those on to the president's 
office where we were listed as number one or number

27:02.123 --> 27:28.030
two how soon in various how soon was that oh in the 
late 80s I think 10 years, 15 years into the life of

27:29.697 --> 27:34.427
the department. How much? We never, never would 
have gotten there without that ice cream cone

27:35.248 --> 27:49.056
concept because having that large number of full 
professors

27:35.248 --> 27:49.056
gave us the ability to turn out a large number of of 
PhDs, and pretty soon you had an Aggie PhD in many of

27:50.183 --> 27:57.755
the leading departments around the country. And 
they started to send their best students back

27:58.937 --> 28:03.765
here, so that network was invaluable. All right, 
if there was a ranking today, where do you think the

28:04.306 --> 28:16.005
department's programs would rank?

28:19.428 --> 28:20.851
I would hope in the top ten. The problem is, if there 
is a problem, is that the field has evolved. The

28:30.108 --> 28:31.190
world has changed. When we built on the momentum of 
the Ork Commission after World War II saying our

28:39.610 --> 28:46.997
parks are worn out, are inadequate, the people 
need new parks, massive amounts of money. The Land

28:47.057 --> 28:54.124
and Water Conservation Fund was initiated with 
huge amounts of federal money going into new park

28:47.057 --> 28:54.124
development. The Wilderness Act was passed, the 
Endangered Species Act. We rode the crest of that

28:58.128 --> 29:01.592
tide all the way. Then in the 90s, I guess you'd say, 
that kind of dried up. The environmental movement

29:08.898 --> 29:18.068
changed to an ecology preservation rather than a 
resource development. Our strength was

29:18.789 --> 29:24.194
development of resources for recreation and park 
purposes.

29:27.698 --> 29:35.706
I gave up the headship voluntarily over Kunkel's 
objections in 85. I said, 20 years is long enough.

29:39.662 --> 29:41.945
He said, I don't want to accept that resignation. I 
said, why? He said, that's our tradition. We don't

29:47.111 --> 29:48.873
do it that way at this school. I said, how do you do 
it? He said, well, you either become incompetent

29:49.995 --> 29:53.860
and get fired or you die. And I said, I'm not willing 
to accept either of those. I've had it. I was really

29:57.685 --> 30:02.571
getting burned out, and I didn't realize I had a 
heart condition that was making me feel so tired.

30:03.428 --> 30:32.085
but so i gave it up in 85 and i just felt like i wasn't 
able to maybe it was my own internal energy haskell

30:03.428 --> 30:32.085
but i didn't feel like i was really able to i've been 
a builder not a maintainer and i felt like it was

30:03.428 --> 30:32.085
becoming a maintaining job not a creating job i 
didn't maybe i didn't have a vision anymore but

30:03.428 --> 30:32.085
anyway it was hard to get things it was hard to get 
money it was hard to get outside grants the

30:32.943 --> 30:57.347
department in the last since I retired in 94 so the 
last five or six years has gone a different

30:32.943 --> 30:57.347
direction the profs that taught resource 
management and facility design and

30:32.943 --> 30:57.347
administration and national parks are gone the 
younger faculty that have been hired are

30:57.985 --> 31:03.154
interested more in the sociology of outdoor 
recreation. In other words, the research being

31:04.056 --> 31:21.327
done is how do you feel about outdoor recreation 
and what value to you psychologically is it and

31:04.056 --> 31:21.327
doing surveys of visitors to see what can be 
provided to make their experience a happier

31:04.056 --> 31:21.327
experience, those kinds of things. not to 
denigrate them not to say it isn't important but

31:21.644 --> 31:41.948
that's where the money is today and this and other 
departments have become more dependent they're

31:21.644 --> 31:41.948
chasing outside dollars to supplement the funds 
that come from the state and from tuition and so the

31:42.417 --> 32:10.180
department currently is successful in a 
different direction than I let it and I don't mind

31:42.417 --> 32:10.180
that you know I did my thing my chapters over and 
done and closed it's a new chapter it's a different

31:42.417 --> 32:10.180
world if I were doing it now I might be doing the same 
thing because the big topics are at-risk youth

31:42.417 --> 32:10.180
making areas and facilities available for 
handicapped people

32:13.265 --> 32:19.233
disadvantaged families, aberrant behavior, 
those kinds of topics. It's not resource

32:20.495 --> 32:22.677
management. Texas Tech still has a program. No, 
they did away with it. Oh, really? Yeah, several

32:27.324 --> 32:28.685
years ago. Are we the only one in the Southwest? No, 
there are other smaller programs at San Marcos, I

32:31.169 --> 32:40.521
think maybe Huntsville.

32:42.323 --> 32:57.621
When Ilo Urbanowski died, he stayed, well, when he 
retired, he stayed out for a few years as the living

32:42.323 --> 32:57.621
legend kind of thing, and was very unhappy for him, 
and that's why I've refused to do that. But he

32:58.282 --> 33:04.990
decided to do that, but they eventually merged it 
with landscape architecture and then phased out

32:58.282 --> 33:04.990
the park over time. So there really isn't a strong 
program at Tech anymore. Who nationally, would be

33:11.298 --> 33:18.907
the other, leave out A&M, who else would be near the 
top of the heap nationally these days? Michigan

33:20.068 --> 33:20.849
State. Again, much more community oriented than 
it was. Penn State.

33:31.020 --> 33:32.662
North Carolina State and Clemson. University of 
Florida.

33:39.226 --> 33:41.889
So they're all land grant that you've named so far.

33:44.753 --> 33:45.974
Yeah. Idaho has maintained the resource 
orientation, but that's where they are. One of our

33:50.500 --> 33:57.849
graduates has been head at Chico, Cal State at 
Chico.

34:03.015 --> 34:05.638
California has a number of good schools. Cal State 
at Los Angeles and San Jose State and San Diego

34:06.378 --> 34:20.734
State, they're all the teachers colleges of the 
University of California system and they're

34:06.378 --> 34:20.734
highly urban in their focus. So I think our 
department here at A&M now is much more

34:20.754 --> 34:36.351
like those other urban schools than it was We were 
quite different, and there wasn't nearly the

34:37.040 --> 34:41.284
competition. But I think our department here is 
doing very well in competing or co-leading in this

34:42.305 --> 34:59.022
arena of social service recreation or at-risk 
youth recreation, those kinds of things. A while

35:00.704 --> 35:04.988
ago, you were giving well-deserved praise to 
President Rutter. Looking back over your years

35:05.778 --> 35:21.017
here, which other presidents and vice presidents 
would you want to thank for their direct support

35:05.778 --> 35:21.017
and interest in the program?

35:30.068 --> 35:31.330
Well, certainly, The first that comes to my mind is 
Dean Kunkel, Harry Kunkel, because he probably

35:32.086 --> 35:42.756
supported things I was trying to do when I didn't 
deserve his support. And I'm forever grateful for

35:44.598 --> 35:47.121
that. I had some tough arguments with him, but 
that's as it should be. If you can't prove, justify

35:52.846 --> 35:58.371
what you're doing, you don't deserve that.

35:59.893 --> 36:01.114
In the early days, Potts Dr. Potts was a strong 
supporter here.

36:08.502 --> 36:16.390
When I got here, because it was a strange campus, 
Haskell, I really tried to become acquainted by

36:08.502 --> 36:16.390
personal visit. When I had somebody new to meet, I 
tried to go to their office, meet them on their own

36:17.972 --> 36:27.962
turf, and then I had a mental picture of where they 
were and what they were doing rather than

36:17.972 --> 36:27.962
telephoning.

36:32.363 --> 36:37.616
got an administrator here now that likes to work by 
computer even with internal memos.

36:40.824 --> 36:42.569
Different styles for different people I guess. 
Different world.

36:47.348 --> 36:51.975
I've had so many warm colleagues on the campus. 
Lineweaver was a tremendous help in those early

36:52.075 --> 37:12.225
days because he carried all, he banked all our 
students until we had our, I think the second or

36:52.075 --> 37:12.225
third year when we got our independent approvals 
for grad students with recreation and park,

36:52.075 --> 37:12.225
recreation and resource development titles. 
then we could start to publicly claim our own.

37:23.626 --> 37:35.901
Had pretty cordial relationships always with the 
coaching staff, the athletic department,

37:23.626 --> 37:35.901
naturally, because there was some affinity 
there, and especially with Randy Mattson.

37:36.708 --> 37:44.861
oftentimes he was able to throw us some money to 
support different kinds of things that benefited

37:36.708 --> 37:44.861
the students. You're saying Randy and his former 
student, he's one of my favorite. Yeah.

37:56.540 --> 37:59.965
Let's see, let's go to Kunkel a second. What was 
Harry Kunkel's administrative operations

38:00.569 --> 38:06.737
methodology? When you had a proposal request 
placed before him, how did he go about evaluating

38:07.358 --> 38:15.188
it, judging it? Generally say no. And then after a 
very fast no, okay. you know, if you're really

38:26.455 --> 38:32.061
serious about this and we're gonna persist, okay, 
explain to me why we need to do this. Did it take very

38:34.183 --> 38:37.707
long for him to reach a final conclusion? No, no.

38:43.653 --> 38:55.686
I think he,

38:43.653 --> 38:55.686
we dare not put this in, but I'm gonna leave it on 
while we talk, but I've got somewhere a

38:43.653 --> 38:55.686
secretarial spiral thing that while I was here the 
three days interviewing I was writing down about

38:56.695 --> 39:06.930
different people, what I thought about President 
Rudder, what I thought about this one and that one

38:56.695 --> 39:06.930
that I met. And a couple of years ago I pulled that 
out from wherever it is and said H.O. Kunkel,

39:15.403 --> 39:19.429
German, hard headed, very pompous, And, you know, 
that's how he came across at first to me. But he,

39:25.291 --> 39:35.505
behind all that exterior, is a really wonderful 
guy, an intelligent person, good writer, a broad

39:25.291 --> 39:35.505
thinker. I see. That's a good summary. Because to 
me, that's an accurate summary of Harry Kunkel.

39:42.555 --> 39:47.902
That at first, he seems like a hard granite wall. 
Mm. but uh if you continue okay he would listen and

39:48.637 --> 40:15.690
so forth how important were the ag experiment 
station and extension services how important

39:48.637 --> 40:15.690
were they for your program well probably um the 
experiment station was critical couldn't well

39:48.637 --> 40:15.690
couldn't have couldn't have every one of the 
people i hired had on the teaching faculty had a

40:16.075 --> 40:20.163
joint appointment with the Experiment Station. 
If I'd been in any of the other nine colleges on the

40:20.183 --> 40:30.283
campus, I would have only had teaching money to 
work with, and consequently couldn't have hired

40:20.183 --> 40:30.283
as many people. But either a lot of these were half 
and half in the early days, So that really

40:35.785 --> 40:38.089
supplemented the money. And it also made it 
attractive for faculty to come from other places.

40:43.397 --> 40:50.249
Because instead of telling them you've got to 
teach four courses each semester, they had a

40:43.397 --> 40:50.249
reduced teaching loan. Because they had 50% of 
their time and their effort was obligated to the

40:51.150 --> 40:58.502
experiment station. And so there weren't very 
many places in the country that could offer that

40:59.410 --> 41:16.816
kind of, you know, you talk about 50 land grant

40:59.410 --> 41:16.816
institutions, but only six maybe, half a dozen of 
them that had programs like ours. So we could

41:17.156 --> 41:25.088
really negotiate

41:17.156 --> 41:25.088
for the best people from around the country on that 
basis. So Experiment Station was critical. The

41:29.819 --> 41:43.794
extension, John Hutchinson wanted us to have an 
extension component, and he paid for similarly

41:29.819 --> 41:43.794
part appointments for a number of people. But that 
was always smaller. Didn't involve, I think when

41:46.256 --> 41:57.107
we were in the horse barn in 70, we had Jack Jones and

41:46.256 --> 41:57.107
Jack Sloan. We had two full-time extension 
specialists, in the state. We never had enough

42:02.853 --> 42:12.424
Extension people to service the kind of demands we 
were getting on their time. But Extension has

42:13.986 --> 42:25.099
always had a tough time like that dealing with 
districts and having enough specialists to

42:13.986 --> 42:25.099
handle the time.

42:27.842 --> 42:28.463
John Hutchinson, I would not call him niggardly, 
but he always had tremendous demands. You know, I

42:35.827 --> 42:41.456
need six more pecan specialists, I need more 
soybean specialists, I need more this and that.

42:41.976 --> 42:44.039
How do you rank your recreation people with that? 
Plus our urban, our extension specialists were

42:44.680 --> 42:50.809
largely sought in the urban area. And Hutchinson 
was very leery about getting involved in the urban

42:51.430 --> 42:57.960
areas at all because the extension except for home 
economics, has largely been seen as a rural income

42:58.902 --> 43:03.610
enhancer. Okay. As a crystal ball gazer, with your 
background and what has been the Agricultural

43:06.014 --> 43:24.184
Extension Service, what could be done in urban 
areas by land grant schools to take what used to be

43:24.873 --> 43:36.705
the ag extension service to the rural area, what 
could be done in the urban area of a similar public

43:24.873 --> 43:36.705
service nature?

43:42.963 --> 44:06.608
Well it isn't too hard to you don't have to be a 
rocket scientist to figure that out look at look at

43:42.963 --> 44:06.608
the 4-H which is dramatically if you look at the 4-H 
membership in this state or any state I suspect 80

43:42.963 --> 44:06.608
percent of their members are going to be urban kids 
and yet Extension has been successful in keeping

43:42.963 --> 44:06.608
the 4-H thing with you know which was a pet cow or a 
pig or a lamb or something So that's the kind of

44:07.364 --> 44:12.873
thing that Extension could do. Extension 
could... Oh, I haven't even thought of this. This

44:18.101 --> 44:19.102
isn't my area. I'm a park and tree people. But the 
thing is that there should be just as big a role if

44:22.528 --> 44:35.127
Extension wanted to capitalize on it in working 
with these urban youth that are... disadvantaged

44:35.410 --> 44:38.515
or hungry for opportunities. Because couldn't we 
build a very good case for the recreational needs

44:39.437 --> 45:01.013
in an urban area where a person with extension, in 
quotation marks, where an extension person would

44:39.437 --> 45:01.013
go into that central city playground area that 
recreational area and help those youngsters,

45:02.680 --> 45:06.930
help the parents. Absolutely, and that's what 
Peter Witt and John Crompton are doing so

45:07.371 --> 45:20.942
successfully with this at-risk youth program, to 
catch them before they become delinquent and to

45:07.371 --> 45:20.942
show people why gangs are are nothing but a 
manifestation of kids' desire to belong to

45:21.260 --> 45:26.848
something and be identified with something. All 
right, so this department is 35 years old in round

45:27.729 --> 45:33.578
numbers today, this program. Oh, Lord. I guess. 
You said that you were elected the president of the

45:36.863 --> 45:40.588
national group. What are some other national or 
international marks of achievement by this

45:40.608 --> 45:49.461
program in that 35 years? Oh, one thing I've been 
negligent in not highlighting is the tourism

45:49.947 --> 45:56.396
aspect. It's become very, very well recognized in 
international tourism. I belonged early to the

46:01.924 --> 46:07.052
International Federation for Park and 
Recreation Administration. Claire Gunn has been

46:08.554 --> 46:13.401
a dominant figure in international work. So has 
John Crompton. And because of those contacts and

46:20.103 --> 46:21.465
connection. We have strong international ties, 
and we practically own the university system in

46:21.506 --> 46:30.462
Korea. Because

46:32.225 --> 46:43.225
my son-in-law was over there diplomatically 
attached to the Eighth Air Force, and we went over

46:32.225 --> 46:43.225
and visited him twice, I got one or two Koreans to 
come. They made a pipeline. Now there's more and

46:47.756 --> 46:50.199
more Koreans, and they've gone back. And the major 
universities in Korea now are staffed with Texas

46:51.260 --> 46:58.109
A&M PhDs.

47:01.473 --> 47:06.339
What about, are there national awards in this 
general area? Yes. David Witt just received.
