00:07.777 --> 00:10.582
Okay, what are the good parts of House Bill 72? 
Well, we've hit on a number of them. The increase in

00:13.827 --> 00:17.433
teacher salaries was essential. I mean, the 
salary before the bill was $11,100, and 70% of the

00:17.453 --> 00:33.801
districts we had ever studied showed that 70% of 
the districts 40 years ago did not add more than 10%

00:17.453 --> 00:33.801
to that base.

00:36.633 --> 00:41.598
Well, in terms of attracting and keeping big 
people, it was not competitive. The 15-2 isn't

00:41.638 --> 00:43.900
really competitive yet. I mean, with the bonuses 
in the career ladder, it could be, but those are

00:43.920 --> 01:04.739
going to have to be increased because if you 
compare the salaries of people who have graduated

00:43.920 --> 01:04.739
from Texas A&M with a four-year degree, right, in 
other fields such as business and engineering and

00:43.920 --> 01:04.739
these other fields, the 15-2 isn't competitive. 
You're going to have to go beyond that. I'd like to

01:06.535 --> 01:21.415
see us move more toward a career ladder with a 
12-month employment for some teachers where they

01:06.535 --> 01:21.415
can work with tutoring programs in the summer, 
special programs for the gifted, like the program

01:06.535 --> 01:21.415
they have up in Garland. They have a program called 
Academic Coaches where they work in the summer.

01:26.462 --> 01:35.935
And instead of just having them coach, like the 
coaches are hired to coach the football in the

01:26.462 --> 01:35.935
summer, these people are hired to coach kids who 
are gifted kids or kids with special problems, and

01:36.320 --> 01:47.175
move toward a system where we have third and fourth 
level career ladder teachers on a 10-month

01:36.320 --> 01:47.175
assignment, a 12-month assignment. Not 
necessarily teaching in regular class, but

01:47.195 --> 02:05.820
running training programs for other teachers in 
the summer, setting up programs where you can have

01:47.195 --> 02:05.820
the beginning teachers of the previous year come 
back in that summer for extra help from moving into

01:47.195 --> 02:05.820
the second year, not treat the beginners as if 
they're experienced people, Every other

02:05.918 --> 02:11.984
profession has an induction program for 
beginning teachers. And they have a mentor

02:12.004 --> 02:16.909
working with them through their first year of 
teaching. And then they work with them in their

02:16.929 --> 02:20.212
second year. And those are the kinds of things that 
I think are going to be essential. So the salary

02:23.856 --> 02:31.523
thing and the structure for career ladders, if we 
can work it out, would be one of the best things to

02:23.856 --> 02:31.523
ever happen. The scholarship programs have to be 
expanded. The research and development

02:36.428 --> 02:40.113
component that's in there, the uses of the new 
technology. See, part of the solution to the

02:40.133 --> 02:45.340
teacher shortage is not to try to keep doing what 
we're doing. It's to use the talent you've got

02:45.860 --> 02:50.947
better in a differentiating way. And have some of 
the models, like talk to us. We have the master

02:53.971 --> 02:58.256
teacher, the two regular teachers, and two 
interns. Take 100 students. And you match your

03:01.083 --> 03:16.521
five people, one with a math background, one with a 
science background, one with an English

03:01.083 --> 03:16.521
background, one with a social studies 
background, and a backup person to work with the

03:01.083 --> 03:16.521
computers and the technology, working as a team 
with those 100 students. And then you utilize the

03:16.541 --> 03:24.391
talents of the people in different ways with those 
100 students. Instead of organizing the school

03:24.411 --> 03:30.398
around each 50-minute period, we've done 50 
minutes of math, 50 minutes of media, 50 minutes in

03:30.850 --> 03:36.217
science, 50 minutes in the gym, 50 minutes in 
foreign language. I mean, it's boring. Just more

03:37.980 --> 03:42.025
of that isn't going to improve the schools. It may 
just compound the boredom. You've got to think

03:44.548 --> 03:56.284
about having sometimes when students work in 
independent study activities with

03:44.548 --> 03:56.284
instructional programs and computers, 
sometimes when they're in small groups,

03:44.548 --> 03:56.284
sometimes when they're in large groups. And then 
instead of having this outstanding physics

03:57.935 --> 04:14.315
teacher teaching five periods a day, you might use 
that person to teach three periods and then have

03:57.935 --> 04:14.315
the students work in independent study areas two 
days a week with the interns. And use that teacher,

04:14.976 --> 04:20.363
that outstanding teacher, much more wisely. 
That's the only way we're going to solve the

04:20.383 --> 04:22.305
shortage. Now, the programs in terms of smaller 
class sizes, I think they're terrific. I think

04:31.133 --> 04:34.196
that Texas could really be a leader in the nation if 
they implemented that. I'm worried about that

04:34.256 --> 04:38.541
because a lot of it seems to be pulling back from 
that. I think the programs for four-year-olds,

04:38.561 --> 04:47.331
especially in disadvantaged areas where you have 
to have a lot of mothers and fathers, both parents

04:38.561 --> 04:47.331
working, We discovered that 28% of the kids in the 
school are coming single-parent homes. 69% come

04:56.925 --> 05:00.709
from homes where both parents work. So if you could 
have a program where each of these four-year-olds

05:00.869 --> 05:15.124
would get some help in starting off on the right 
foot, regardless of their background, if you

05:00.869 --> 05:15.124
could help those kids stop of learning, reading, 
writing, and spelling in those first three days.

05:25.394 --> 05:28.278
That, I think, is one of the major aspects of this 
bill. The payoff, unless you pay not be able to see

05:28.358 --> 05:35.570
until 12, 15 years from now, it's only important to 
stick with those requirements. There are a lot of

05:36.651 --> 05:40.057
other good aspects of the bill. I think the 
requirement in terms of the accreditation where

05:43.910 --> 05:54.142
they would be evaluating these school districts 
and holding them to these standards, if they can

05:43.910 --> 05:54.142
set that up. And I would hope they would look when 
they go into these school districts to make sure

05:54.162 --> 06:02.031
they're not hiring unqualified teachers. One of 
the real scandals in this state and states around

06:02.051 --> 06:08.798
the country is the number of people that are hiring 
on emergency permits. Just putting a warm body in a

06:08.919 --> 06:12.803
class to hold the class. There are 5,892 emergency 
permits given in Texas two years ago. I don't have

06:18.606 --> 06:20.189
last year's data. I'm sure it's gone up. And then 
there's a lot of school districts that are

06:22.092 --> 06:28.563
allowing teachers to teach out of their field if 
they've been prepared. With the math shortage,

06:28.583 --> 06:37.298
some districts have taken the elementary 
teachers who've had some courses in math and

06:28.583 --> 06:37.298
making them secondary education math teachers. 
Well, that's not right. That's not going to

06:38.020 --> 06:38.841
improve. See, the requirement now that there be 
another year of math for every high school student

06:39.648 --> 06:53.007
will just be a hoax perpetuated in the public by the 
legislature if we can't get more and better math

06:39.648 --> 06:53.007
teachers. We've got a state where over half the 
teachers who were hired two years ago to teach math

06:53.027 --> 07:00.037
were unqualified teachers. Now requiring 
another year of math for every high school

07:00.057 --> 07:09.570
student, which will triple the need for math 
teachers at a time when only half the people

07:00.057 --> 07:09.570
teaching math are unqualified to teach it. So you 
don't just improve quality by making regulations

07:13.697 --> 07:18.184
or laws. It takes an incentive system to get 
competitive salaries to get these outstanding

07:18.565 --> 07:29.162
math students to go into teaching rather than 
going to work for IBM. And they're not going to be

07:30.423 --> 07:35.912
attracted to teaching unless you give them good 
salaries and the conditions in the workplace

07:36.736 --> 07:45.547
where they can feel like they're making a major

07:36.736 --> 07:45.547
contribution. I personally believe that there 
are a lot of outstanding people out there who would

07:45.567 --> 07:54.998
like to get into teaching if we can make it an 
exciting work setting. We've got a situation here

07:55.018 --> 08:01.126
at A&M where we have 264 majors in Mathematics 
Education and 329 in Science Education. We

08:01.146 --> 08:05.491
prepare more math and science people than any 
university in the nation. But if these people and

08:07.313 --> 08:26.257
not get good salaries and good support as teacher 
scholars who are treated as people who are

08:07.313 --> 08:26.257
responsible for the intellectual development of 
children, not babysitters or policemen in study

08:07.313 --> 08:26.257
halls, they're going to leave teaching. Unless 
you can improve the condition of the workplace and

08:26.277 --> 08:30.642
improve the reward system. Now they will stick 
with it because you've got to love kids and love

08:30.842 --> 08:34.587
teachers in order to sustain a profession, you 
know, stay in the profession. But you can't expect

08:40.998 --> 08:52.252
people to stay in a profession where they can't 
make enough money to send their own kids out to

08:40.998 --> 08:52.252
college, where they spend their whole life 
preparing other people's kids for college. And so

08:52.272 --> 09:01.644
these are some of the things in the bill that are yet 
to be implemented that I think should make a real

08:52.272 --> 09:01.644
difference. Governor Mark White is planning to 
have Texas colleges universities reform what are

09:05.380 --> 09:31.050
necessary reforms for higher education we got 
another do we have another couple of hours you know

09:05.380 --> 09:31.050
all of the

09:05.380 --> 09:31.050
there's a new book out

09:05.380 --> 09:31.050
by Ernest Boyer

09:37.460 --> 09:53.914
on

09:37.460 --> 09:53.914
policy issues

09:37.460 --> 09:53.914
in higher education. Anyway, what he does, he 
talks about the five contradictions in higher

09:55.875 --> 10:04.463
education. You've got a situation where the 
professors These are five

10:09.168 --> 10:30.775
areas

10:09.168 --> 10:30.775
we have

10:09.168 --> 10:30.775
to deal with. The first area is we've got to get the 
expectations of the professors tuned in with the

10:30.795 --> 10:33.218
students that they're teaching. It's very hard to 
get professors to focus on students and what the

10:33.238 --> 10:35.961
students do. And when they do, they never satisfy 
those students. better

10:37.973 --> 10:49.388
students.

10:55.757 --> 11:00.564
They want the high achievers in high SAT scores. 
And there's a lot of blame placed as students come

11:00.584 --> 11:02.606
to the colleges unprepared and that kind of thing. 
So one of the real problems is we have to get the

11:02.626 --> 11:05.510
professors committed to teaching the students 
that they end up with. And if it's a community

11:05.530 --> 11:06.732
college, we don't expect students to have

11:07.707 --> 11:28.661
the abilities

11:07.707 --> 11:28.661
that

11:07.707 --> 11:28.661
the people that hire them have. And what I think we 
need more than anything else right now is a student

11:28.681 --> 11:32.007
orientation of the product and the commitment to 
that as a major mission of the university. And

11:32.027 --> 11:32.668
research is important. But the

11:33.290 --> 11:55.273
primary

11:33.290 --> 11:55.273
mission

11:33.290 --> 11:55.273
of the university is to educate the students . And 
that has to be put back and forth. The other area,

11:56.074 --> 11:57.175
another area, is the curriculum itself. The whole 
issue of how much career and vocational

11:57.195 --> 11:59.057
preparation and how much general education. It 
was the same issue as the select committee talked

11:59.077 --> 12:00.258
about. What's the place of vocational education 
and seminary education? If you extend that, to

12:02.517 --> 12:10.590
higher

12:02.517 --> 12:10.590
education. How much of it should be career 
oriented to a career? And there are a lot of debates

12:15.579 --> 12:21.749
now that the best preparation for most careers 
should probably be a good liberal education for

12:15.579 --> 12:21.749
people. It should be a good core curriculum for 
everybody. The engineers who go through four

12:22.911 --> 12:28.660
years of preparation without any humanities 
courses are not prepared, either for engineering

12:22.911 --> 12:28.660
or for the world. And I

12:29.450 --> 12:41.128
think you can

12:29.450 --> 12:41.128
make a case for that myself. But that's for the day. 
We need to define what the core curriculum should

12:44.553 --> 12:51.483
be in 1985 to prepare people for living out their 
lives in the 20th century. And we need to be clear on

12:51.503 --> 12:53.466
how much time is needed in the curriculum to be 
devoted to that. And

12:54.273 --> 13:15.052
now it's

12:54.273 --> 13:15.052
just a matter of saying everybody ought to take two 
courses of math, two courses of history, two

12:54.273 --> 13:15.052
courses of English, two courses of a foreign 
language, and then quote, then literally educate

12:54.273 --> 13:15.052
them. I think a lot of it has to do with how it's 
taught also. If you're just in a class being taught

13:16.213 --> 13:18.895
by a graduate assistant and 200 students, you 
know, you're not learning too much about inquiry.

13:18.915 --> 13:20.677
If you're just sitting there listening to his 
lecture, he doesn't even want to be there. He's

13:20.697 --> 13:21.698
just making his graduate assistantship money. 
You

13:22.589 --> 13:43.033
know,

13:22.589 --> 13:43.033
we really need to get some of these full professors 
started to teach all these other courses again.

13:43.053 --> 13:45.336
Like how to make a real commitment to teach the main 
curriculum, et cetera. The whole area of student

13:45.356 --> 13:46.858
affairs in higher education is similar, isn't it? 
What is the role of student affairs in a

13:46.878 --> 13:47.919
university? Now here we have over 500 books. I

13:49.876 --> 14:10.983
think

13:49.876 --> 14:10.983
this would be a completely different place 
without the student affairs program. It has a

14:11.003 --> 14:13.707
major impact on intellectual refinement, as well 
as the social environment of people of every age

14:11.003 --> 14:13.707
that people are acting like. I talked to Susan 
Ellis one time about this, and she said, He told me

14:15.998 --> 14:36.977
that the thing that made

14:15.998 --> 14:36.977
the most difference in his life when he was at A&M

14:15.998 --> 14:36.977
was the way he encouraged the government. He got 
interested in international relations. He got

14:38.959 --> 14:39.900
interested in politics. He got interested in 
managing the business. He went to hire the

14:42.142 --> 14:42.723
business. But it was an out-of-class activity in 
the environment of student involvement in this

14:42.743 --> 14:44.745
kind of thing. It gave him that. But we

14:45.327 --> 15:00.713
need to look at these kinds of things in addition to 
looking at the curriculum. There's going to be a

15:00.733 --> 15:11.571
lot of interest from the private government and 
the state on how you can use education as an

15:00.733 --> 15:11.571
instrument for economic development and how you 
can use it to teach people to be ready for the

15:00.733 --> 15:11.571
technological age. Texas

15:14.015 --> 15:31.181
economy

15:14.015 --> 15:31.181
is dependent on oil. The government's duty in 
terms of the mind of the Texas student is the new

15:31.201 --> 15:34.606
oil. The new oil of Texas. And that's going to solve 
the state's problems with the economy. Well,

15:38.332 --> 15:42.418
another area is to get Texas beyond itself. to

15:42.888 --> 15:59.019
the international activities. Right now, we're 
all neighbors, and then something happens in

15:59.039 --> 16:02.826
Ireland and Italy and, you know, some down in 
Mexico and other stuff. We're all part of it. So

16:03.287 --> 16:04.710
you've got to start acting like we're citizens of 
the world. you

16:05.332 --> 16:27.318
know,

16:05.332 --> 16:27.318
as soon as there's

16:05.332 --> 16:27.318
a call at a station and get out of our current, you 
know, our attitudes about who we are and where we

16:05.332 --> 16:27.318
want to relate to individually. And every, and 
this shouldn't just be for colleges, students

16:27.338 --> 16:29.360
ought to be getting this in the schools. There 
ought to be a global approach to study in all of the

16:29.380 --> 16:31.002
schools in this state. We've

16:32.433 --> 16:54.277
got a long way to go in that, I think, in terms of the 
kind of education that we provide. This

16:54.297 --> 16:56.960
out-of-state student increase in tuition and 
things like that can be without a lack of

16:54.297 --> 16:56.960
sensitivity in some respects to the need. The 
value for Texas students in having an

16:56.980 --> 16:58.542
international student body that

17:00.007 --> 17:18.488
we

17:00.007 --> 17:18.488
shouldn't be saying, let's take them and help them 
out. We should be saying, let's take them because

17:18.508 --> 17:24.375
they're essential to having a world, a university 
that's world-oriented. They add as much to our

17:24.395 --> 17:25.496
environment as we give to them. And that attitude, 
I think, is going to have to be looked at,

17:25.516 --> 17:29.541
particularly looking beyond Texas

17:30.618 --> 17:48.262
and what they want this particular year, but this 
university should become. Those are just a few of

17:48.282 --> 17:51.025
the things. I think we need to take a look at 
articulation between the high schools, the

17:51.726 --> 17:54.790
community colleges, and the university. Much 
closer working together. I think we need to take a

17:55.912 --> 17:58.195
look at the collaboration and cooperation within 
systems and a cross-system in the state, I think we

17:58.816 --> 18:19.084
could do

17:58.816 --> 18:19.084
much more within our own system as we work between 
Prairie View and this campus. And it's only 45

18:19.104 --> 18:21.868
minutes away. We ought to be having a lot more 
exchange programs between students, a lot more

18:21.888 --> 18:25.573
exchange programs between faculty. We're even on 
different calendars. We're not even on the same

18:26.414 --> 18:27.135
calendar. And then when we try to do exchanges,

18:27.841 --> 18:41.858
you know, swap faculty. Well, if a person goes down 
there and teaches, he has a different calendar for

18:41.878 --> 18:48.086
the course he's teaching than we have here. So it 
makes it very hard. If we were just on the same

18:50.108 --> 18:51.770
calendar, we could swap easily. I mean, instead of 
a person teaching the sociology course down at

18:51.790 --> 18:56.296
Fairview, and we could teach it up here. Same 
course, same, you know, level. just swap and teach

18:57.845 --> 19:11.702
one place

18:57.845 --> 19:11.702
or another each semester. We could do a lot more of 
that. We could enhance the environment of both

19:14.746 --> 19:18.811
campuses. But we don't. We're only 45 minutes 
away. We can go to Europe and London and have

19:20.072 --> 19:23.076
comparative education programs in London. We 
have programs only in Japan. But it seems to be

19:25.779 --> 19:27.261
harder to go down here in a prairie 45 minutes a 
week. I bet more faculty members have been to

19:31.246 --> 19:41.158
foreign countries than have been down to Paris. 
Okay. What are the advantages and disadvantages

19:41.298 --> 19:45.863
of reforming higher education? I don't think 
there are any disadvantages. I think that there

19:49.407 --> 19:53.552
are many aspects of almost any organization to 
make it better.

20:01.311 --> 20:08.219
And I don't know of any organization that couldn't 
be better. The key is to decide what needs changing

20:08.239 --> 20:15.329
and to make sure that change is better than what 
existed. There's a wonderful saying that I've

20:15.349 --> 20:19.514
learned since I've been here in Texas. Don't fix it 
until it's broke. There are enough things that are

20:20.976 --> 20:23.539
broke to be changed. that we can work on without 
following up the things that are going well. And it

20:29.585 --> 20:38.513
takes some analysis to make sure that we need to 
spend that time on what needs changing and what's

20:29.585 --> 20:38.513
possible to change. You shouldn't spend a whole 
lot of time on things that can't be changed. But

20:44.878 --> 20:50.923
things that can be changed and ought to be changed, 
we ought to be working on. And I think that that will

20:50.943 --> 20:52.885
take you know, some real study. And we ought to set 
up some evaluation process to make sure we get

20:57.332 --> 21:07.382
feedback on whether we're achieving what we set 
out to achieve. And that has to be built into the

21:07.402 --> 21:13.228
initial plan as we go about doing it. And like any 
kind of reform, you know, change, we can move

21:13.248 --> 21:21.977
either backwards or forwards with a change. all 
changes

21:22.396 --> 21:41.240
didn't necessarily bring improvement.

21:41.260 --> 21:49.230
So we have to say that we're going to set up and 
accomplish something and set up a system to

21:41.260 --> 21:49.230
evaluate how does the quality of Texas public 
education compare with other states? Texas has

21:50.425 --> 21:54.852
some speculative problems. And one of the worst 
things we do, and the state and the federal

21:54.872 --> 22:09.014
government recently did this, is to take these SAT 
scores in one state and compare them with another.

22:10.316 --> 22:16.045
The first thing that's wrong with that, if you look 
at this first, is that In some states, only 5% or 6%

22:16.295 --> 22:20.599
of the students take the test.

22:23.823 --> 22:26.926
But in Texas, 32% of the students take the test. 69% 
in Connecticut take it.

22:34.514 --> 22:36.236
3% in North Dakota. So that kind of data doesn't 
mean anything. So when we do comparisons, we have

22:42.162 --> 22:45.205
to be careful. But what we need to do is look at, 
instead of saying, how does it compare, we ought to

22:45.978 --> 23:00.656
be saying, how well are we doing in improving what 
exists in Texas? Now, Texas has a situation where

23:00.676 --> 23:11.950
37% of the students in the school are from Hispanic 
backgrounds. Texas and California. California

23:13.282 --> 23:20.028
would probably be the first state where what was 
the minority would become the majority. Texas

23:20.048 --> 23:21.290
would probably be second. So we have a special 
problem in having a number of children that speak

23:23.672 --> 23:30.779
English as a second language. We need to say, how 
are we doing at solving that problem so all of these

23:30.819 --> 23:42.630
kids can have equal access to educational 
opportunity in the state as it moves, where this

23:43.724 --> 23:56.179
population that it has is going to be able to meet 
the needs of the year 2000. Everybody has a piece of

23:56.319 --> 24:01.405
the action here to deal with this problem. 
Education is not something that just schools

24:01.425 --> 24:05.410
should be concerned about. This study that I just 
finished working on with the Committee for

24:05.430 --> 24:12.398
Economic Development, Investing in Our 
Children, business in the school. Industry and

24:14.817 --> 24:23.873
business have a role to play in this, and the higher 
ed institutions have a role to play in improving

24:14.817 --> 24:23.873
the public education. So instead of spending our 
time saying, how do we compare with somebody else

24:23.893 --> 24:37.457
using these crazy tests, which we don't have the 
same populations we're comparing We should be

24:38.872 --> 24:50.443
systematically identifying what it is we're 
trying to achieve, and then ask ourselves, how

24:38.872 --> 24:50.443
well are we doing in it? And I believe that if you 
look at the effort that Texas is making as a

24:50.463 --> 25:08.760
criterion for how we're doing,

24:50.463 --> 25:08.760
we could get A's for that. I've never been in a state 
where there's more commitment to doing something

25:09.550 --> 25:17.701
about improving education. Now, beating up on 
each other about how bad things are won't do it. I

25:23.408 --> 25:25.150
mean, that's a waste of energy. We need to say, what 
are we doing well? And there are a lot of things

25:28.534 --> 25:30.517
we're doing well. You know, I think the 
Barling-Williams programs in Texas are models

25:31.058 --> 25:35.463
for the rest of the nation. We ought to be very proud 
of them. And we can show you and show in certain

25:38.440 --> 25:44.668
districts where there have been tremendous 
strides made. There are outstanding schools in

25:44.688 --> 25:49.355
the state that could be used as lighthouse 
schools. If you look at the kind of programs in

25:49.375 --> 26:00.229
Houston School District in terms of the magnet 
schools, Dallas has some outstanding programs

25:49.375 --> 26:00.229
going on there. There are school districts and 
rural schools all over the state that have some

26:00.665 --> 26:07.355
exciting things going on. We want to use those as 
lighthouses and share the best practices that are

26:07.535 --> 26:14.044
going on. And the universities can help with that. 
We started a principal center in which we brought

26:17.790 --> 26:24.259
together a congress of principals, outstanding 
principals from all over the state. We had 58 of

26:25.184 --> 26:30.009
them here last summer in what we call the 
Principal's Academy. So we took House Bill 72 and

26:30.109 --> 26:39.960
said, how are we doing in implementing the 
Declaration of Independence? Where are the

26:39.980 --> 26:42.423
problems now? You know, performance appraisal 
was one. How do we do good performance appraisal?

26:46.888 --> 26:48.089
We actually set up some practices when we did that. 
We brought in resource people to help with this.

26:49.791 --> 26:51.613
The career ladder, we looked at that. We brought in 
people who were the principals of the schools that

26:51.863 --> 27:03.057
Sarah Lightfoot wrote about in her study of high 
school. The study showed some of the outstanding

27:03.077 --> 27:08.323
high schools in the country who brought the 
principals of some of those schools in. We need to

27:08.343 --> 27:09.285
do more of that. We need to share with each other 
what's the best ways to improve the quality of

27:09.305 --> 27:16.133
education. in the schools. Principals Academy, 
we can do, we set up nine clusters now around the

27:19.368 --> 27:24.276
state. We're also tied in with other universities 
in those regions to help with those principals, 58

27:24.336 --> 27:33.149
principals who attend the academy. Those 
principals will come back in November for a

27:33.169 --> 27:40.399
follow-up meeting and come back next summer for 
another full week in the academy. So we'll begin to

27:40.419 --> 27:44.365
have a network of practicing professionals who 
can, in fact, be a part of a network for

27:45.577 --> 27:53.549
implementing good practices. And they're all 
connected now with a hotline where we share

27:53.569 --> 28:01.741
information daily across these groups. So 
there's a lot of good things going on in Texas.

28:05.187 --> 28:09.573
There's a lot of interest on the part of the 
technology people who work with the state.

28:09.593 --> 28:12.638
They're just setting up interactive TV programs. 
They even pipe programs into schools with a small

28:14.703 --> 28:23.396
roast because we only had a small group of students 
at an advanced level studying certain kinds of

28:14.703 --> 28:23.396
things. You can connect several different 
schools. You can make up a class. And you can do this

28:27.863 --> 28:28.804
over interactive TV. Or if they don't have a 
chemistry professor or a biology professor, you

28:28.824 --> 28:37.337
can pipe this in through interactive television. 
Most programs are now in operation in Texas.

28:40.962 --> 28:43.005
They're not extensively developed yet, But 
they're on our way with us. And I think we ought to

28:46.078 --> 29:12.317
highlight the good things that are going on, 
because as a result of a lot of the dialogue that

28:46.078 --> 29:12.317
took place with this black committee, the morale 
of the teachers, especially, got very low,

28:46.078 --> 29:12.317
because they interpreted the being in the focus, 
they interpreted it as criticism, especially

28:46.078 --> 29:12.317
when the Nation at Risk came out and said, you know, 
our schools are in a shambles, and that we were

28:46.078 --> 29:12.317
going to, declare war or somebody was going to come 
in and try to defeat us, and they create schools

29:13.192 --> 29:21.981
like we've got now. We're committing unilateral 
disarmament by the way we set up our education

29:22.001 --> 29:27.327
system. Well, teachers can only take so much of 
that. And really, even the good teachers feel like

29:29.469 --> 29:33.053
they're being beat on. So if we can stop beating on 
the teachers and start emphasizing working

29:33.333 --> 29:41.882
together and helping at each of these levels, I 
think that effort-wise, we're doing as much or

29:42.453 --> 29:53.390
more than almost any other state.

29:53.470 --> 29:59.300
How does Texas rank with other states regarding 
public education? Well, you see, I think you can't

29:59.320 --> 30:06.691
answer that question unless you take a specific 
area. And the worst thing to do is to take SAT tests

30:09.824 --> 30:20.578
and do comparisons like the federal government 
did, because as I mentioned before, you know, only

30:09.824 --> 30:20.578
3% of the kids in North Dakota even take the test. 
32% in Texas take it. So comparing that data

30:22.401 --> 30:25.044
doesn't give you anything. You know, what you 
really need to do is take an area, like with career

30:26.266 --> 30:36.220
ladders, there are nine states in the country that 
are experimenting with career ladders. We're one

30:36.240 --> 30:37.661
of them. Now, whether that makes us better than the 
other 41 states, they're not doing anything on

30:40.385 --> 30:45.192
that yet. I don't know. It all depends on whether 
Clean Water ends up being better than what existed

30:46.013 --> 30:51.240
before. And we're in a state of piloting that, 
trying that. I think it will be better. I think it's

30:56.307 --> 31:02.916
better just because we're examining new ways to 
create a profession. Trying ways to keep good

31:03.605 --> 31:09.831
teachers in the classrooms without having to 
become administrators in order to make a decent

31:03.605 --> 31:09.831
salary. That's a good goal. Now whether we can do it 
or not is yet to be seen. But I'm proud to be in a state

31:15.537 --> 31:20.662
where we're trying.

31:20.682 --> 31:24.446
Are very many other states reforming public 
education? Quite a few of them. Quite a few of them.

31:27.669 --> 31:29.231
And they're doing it in different ways. I don't 
know too many of them. Perhaps New York and

31:31.012 --> 31:32.734
Tennessee. uh moving in in florida and maybe north 
dakota i'm moving in in a very comprehensive way

31:33.862 --> 31:59.717
probably texas and there's a more 
all-encompassing set of reforms than any place

31:33.862 --> 31:59.717
else that i know of i mean what we're trying to do is 
deal with all the whole thing the curriculum the

31:33.862 --> 31:59.717
way schools are staffed the way they're evaluated 
the way they're administered we're trying to do

32:00.018 --> 32:27.240
you know the way teachers are prepared the way 
they're evaluated we're

32:00.018 --> 32:27.240
dealing with everything in this reform package

32:00.018 --> 32:27.240
uh i can't think of any other state that has a more 
comprehensive

32:00.018 --> 32:27.240
reform package than texas it may be one of our 
problems you know because we're trying to do all of

32:00.018 --> 32:27.240
them at once And we're trying to do it in a short 
period of time. It's going to take some real

32:32.346 --> 32:49.841
sensitivity now to get, especially the teaching 
profession itself, involved in having some sense

32:32.346 --> 32:49.841
of ownership in this package, in implementing 
this package. All of the surveys we've done so far

32:49.861 --> 32:57.868
indicate that the teachers are supportive of a lot 
of these reforms, like career ladders. It's just

32:58.878 --> 33:09.571
that they have a lot of questions about the way 
they're being implemented and their lack of

32:58.878 --> 33:09.571
involvement in the design of them and the carrying 
out of them. After this fact, did we get them to feel

33:09.731 --> 33:18.221
some investment in this whole thing and change 
those things? We shouldn't be afraid to change

33:18.241 --> 33:25.510
those things that need changing because of the 
fact that it was such an all-encompassing bill It

33:26.063 --> 33:35.715
would be very natural now to go back and have to fine 
tune it without destroying the major elements

33:26.063 --> 33:35.715
of it. Do you have any personal ideas on other 
possible reforms for Texas that you would like to

33:35.735 --> 33:43.144
see implemented? Well, I'd like to see a system 
where we have much more opportunity

33:43.164 --> 33:53.978
for school districts to innovate and try 
different approaches to the way schools are

33:43.164 --> 33:53.978
organized I'd like to see a system where you have 
minimal options within the public education

33:54.717 --> 34:10.360
system, where you might have a school which is 
pretty much independently oriented, where your

33:54.717 --> 34:10.360
students do a lot of individual study and use a lot 
of technology. You might have some schools

34:10.381 --> 34:14.767
organized around more than once a SORI approach. 
You might have schools, some of them, run by

34:14.787 --> 34:19.935
industry in collaboration with the schools. You 
have a lot more work in terms of outside of the

34:22.477 --> 34:36.533
school activity and not have so much uniformity 
that doesn't allow a certain amount of uniformity

34:22.477 --> 34:36.533
in terms of goals and standards, I think you mean. 
But the way those goals and standards are

34:37.234 --> 34:44.502
implemented, that we should have a lot of 
opportunity and flexibility and autonomy. to

34:45.275 --> 34:49.119
meet those goals and standards. I think the role of 
the state ought to be to set those goals and

34:49.219 --> 35:05.836
standards, but allow maximum freedom for the 
local communities in collaboration with

34:49.219 --> 35:05.836
community resources of a variety of kinds to find 
different ways of implementing these standards.

35:05.856 --> 35:13.223
And I think that there are a lot of ways to use people 
in communities and resources that we haven't

35:05.856 --> 35:13.223
tapped yet. I think that the

35:13.979 --> 35:30.694
way we conceive of education, we ought to be 
thinking of it more in terms of from birth

35:13.979 --> 35:30.694
throughout all of life. People of all ages need 
education, and I can see us providing

35:30.834 --> 35:41.944
opportunities where you have some community 
education settings, where you have senior

35:30.834 --> 35:41.944
citizens, preschool children, children who are 
elementary and secondary, in the same

35:42.380 --> 36:03.802
environments where you have the senior citizens 
leaving for the four-year-old and using schools

35:42.380 --> 36:03.802
as learning resource centers for anybody

35:42.380 --> 36:03.802
and open up the way we can see them in learning 
environments.

36:03.822 --> 36:03.922
Okay. And finally, what happened to Mr. and Mrs. 
Gabler? Well, I think they're still around. They

36:10.740 --> 36:17.167
attend the meetings each year when the textbooks 
are reviewed. The thing that's different now at

36:17.187 --> 36:30.081
the textbook hearings than in the past is the 
people who are supportive of those texts also

36:17.187 --> 36:30.081
appear now. Before, it only used to be those people 
who had some criticism of what was going on. But at

36:35.667 --> 36:37.969
the hearings now, when the Gabriel speaks, 
there's usually someone who will take the other

36:38.759 --> 36:50.503
side at that same

36:38.759 --> 36:50.503
textbook here who will, well, disagree. But I 
think it's all silly. Okay.
