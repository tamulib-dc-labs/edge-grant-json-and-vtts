WEBVTT

00:02.748 --> 00:08.034
Okay, start out with, tell me how you got into the 
service. Are you familiar with the Berry Clan? No,

00:12.199 --> 00:12.499
sir. Okay, this was back in the days where they had 
universal military draft for physicians.

00:22.030 --> 00:29.498
It was a real pain to get into a residency and get 
drafted. And also the military needed a way that

00:31.469 --> 00:42.923
they could plan on the number of people in 
different specialties that would be coming in at a

00:31.469 --> 00:42.923
certain time. So they devised a plan called the 
Berry Plan, Dr. Frank Berry. And what it did is you

00:50.753 --> 01:01.206
could volunteer to go into X branch of the service 
at X time. And the time you could pick was either

01:03.259 --> 01:15.476
immediately after your internship or after so 
much residency had been, you know, partial

01:03.259 --> 01:15.476
residency had been accomplished or after you'd 
finished. And I got in the, I got in the very plan

01:17.499 --> 01:22.165
because I wanted to finish my training. and get 
through with it, get out of Houston, because I

01:22.718 --> 01:28.606
didn't lose anything down there. And so, you know, 
I'm just kind of an orderly person, just about how

01:29.447 --> 01:34.974
the desk looked. And I wanted to finish my 
training, go into service, and practice my

01:34.994 --> 01:38.659
specialty. So that's how I got into the military. 
What year was that? I must have gotten a commission

01:45.868 --> 01:49.553
in about, I thought, well, I don't remember 
exactly because my commission was backdated

01:50.073 --> 01:56.200
until the time I entered medical school. So I was 
commissioned. My date of rank was 1957, but I

01:58.282 --> 02:09.134
probably got in, I mean, I probably signed up in the 
very plan in 60 or 61 when I was junior or senior in

01:58.282 --> 02:09.134
medical school. And I finished my training in 67. 
So when you volunteered for it, you weren't really

02:11.036 --> 02:18.565
aware of what was going on in Vietnam and that you 
might be sent over there? No. Probably

02:19.469 --> 02:31.105
not, because they weren't really getting heated 
up about that, about Vietnam in the real early 60s.

02:31.586 --> 02:42.721
We were over there participating, and we thought 
it was going to

02:31.586 --> 02:42.721
be a major deal. Excuse me. Now, to get over to once 
you were in Vietnam, skip to a few years later.

02:51.766 --> 02:55.671
First of all, what was the general condition of the 
military hospitals in Vietnam? Good shape? I was

02:59.616 --> 03:01.479
in the Air Force. The Air Force did not have a 
hospital in Vietnam until

03:02.941 --> 03:16.358
I guess 1966, maybe 65, 66. They put a a big hospital 
complex in Cameron Bay. And they had, the only

03:21.896 --> 03:36.009
other medical facilities the Air Force had were 
dispensaries at the various Air Force bases,

03:21.896 --> 03:36.009
which was perfectly adequate, because number 
one, pilots were the healthiest bunch of guys in

03:21.896 --> 03:36.009
the world. I mean, if you had anything wrong with 
you, you can't be one. So they really didn't need a

03:39.672 --> 03:44.877
hospital, and the Army had excellent facilities 
within two or three miles of each of the Air Force

03:45.464 --> 03:48.587
dispensaries. And the Navy hospital up at Da Nang 
was just superior. The facilities were

03:54.853 --> 03:57.575
excellent. So where did, once you got into 
Vietnam, where did you spend most of your time? I

04:02.960 --> 04:06.303
spent time, I was assigned to the Air Force 
hospital at Cam Ranh Bay. And then I had to visit the

04:07.144 --> 04:12.349
various dispensaries in the country as a 
consultant. and some in the Venture Hospitals.

04:17.092 --> 04:20.297
Okay, so I guess you probably saw other hospitals, 
though. Oh, yeah. Okay, so some of these questions

04:20.818 --> 04:29.451
may be fine answering based on those other ones 
rather than one you ever had. I don't know. Like the

04:30.973 --> 04:38.985
picture that a lot of Americans get of Army 
hospitals, many of them who aren't familiar draw

04:30.973 --> 04:38.985
that picture from shows like MASH. And to clear the 
record, how do they compare it?

04:45.826 --> 04:50.572
The facilities were much superior in Vietnam. At 
the hospitals. I can't say anything about aid

04:52.835 --> 04:54.898
stations. I guess they had gone from MASH units to 
MUST units, I guess, by Vietnam. And I can't

05:01.326 --> 05:03.229
remember what MUST stands for. But some people 
operated in MASH-like facilities. But by and

05:08.676 --> 05:13.302
large, the evacuation was so good, that people got 
from the field to a really well-equipped hospital

05:14.024 --> 05:19.589
quickly. And most of the work was really done in 
well-equipped facilities. The personalities

05:26.176 --> 05:34.364
and attitudes are remarkably similar to the MASH 
people. One of the first meetings I ever went to

05:34.464 --> 05:40.690
after I got back from Vietnam was in Atlanta. And I 
picked up a copy of a book called MASH at the airport

05:44.534 --> 05:45.755
in Dallas. And I thought they were going to divert 
the plane and put me off in New Orleans, because I

05:46.436 --> 05:52.982
laughed so hard at it. Because I knew everybody in 
the book.

05:57.887 --> 06:02.772
You mentioned field hospitals and other 
hospitals. But can you clarify a little bit, what

06:02.872 --> 06:08.438
was the actual outline of the military hospital 
system? Oh, it's been so long, I've probably blown

06:08.458 --> 06:13.022
a lot of it. In the Air Force, the chain of command 
was from the base dispensary to the hospital at

06:13.694 --> 06:21.765
Cameron, so that was no problem.

06:26.791 --> 06:37.866
With

06:26.791 --> 06:37.866
the Marines and the Army, there's been a lot of this 
stretching me. See, I guess you had battalion aid

06:37.886 --> 06:41.170
stations. which were mainly concerned with 
picking up and triage of casualties. And from

06:49.684 --> 07:00.138
there, the people were evacuated, I guess, to the 
field hospitals.

07:00.158 --> 07:06.887
And the Army, the Navy had the NSA hospital. at Da 
Nang, which took care of most of the major work that

07:07.407 --> 07:12.572
came out of I-Corps. And then the Army had an 
excellent hospital in Pleiku that served most of

07:14.514 --> 07:22.902
the Central Highlands.

07:28.928 --> 07:36.435
We got some of that fallout at Cameron, in that 
general area. And then the Army

07:37.495 --> 07:53.953
had a big, big field hospital down in Saigon, 
obviously, and one at

07:37.495 --> 07:53.953
Ambitui. I don't remember. Some funny little name 
down there. But the evacuation was so good,

07:57.396 --> 08:02.642
really, that I think most of the people really got 
into it. secure facilities fairly rapidly, and it

08:03.314 --> 08:13.266
was a good, a fairly decent atmosphere for the 
doctor to work in. Or on the subject, I don't know

08:13.286 --> 08:29.845
what you've done about other people to talk to, but 
Dr. Jack Walker, who's the internist here in town,

08:13.286 --> 08:29.845
was at one of the Army hospitals down near Saigon, 
and he was I guess Jack would now see you then, so he

08:30.044 --> 08:37.374
was at a level where he could probably tell you more 
about our organization. I've talked to Dr. Lee.

08:41.620 --> 08:47.448
I've got to set up a time to talk to him, maybe, 
because I need more information. Jack was a career

08:47.468 --> 08:56.220
officer, and Ed and I were both just passing 
through, so Jack might really give you some

08:47.468 --> 08:56.220
insight that Ed and I can't do. I

08:57.247 --> 09:13.703
know the hospital you're at might not apply to this 
question, but I was curious as to how much danger

08:57.247 --> 09:13.703
the hospitals were in as far as attacks from the VC 
or under attack. Mine was in absolutely no danger

09:14.628 --> 09:18.132
at all. Cameron was attacked one time when I was 
there and it was sort of just a little token effort.

09:26.361 --> 09:28.243
They just threw some mortars in out on the edge. 
Cameron was so big and so well protected.

09:35.731 --> 09:39.775
Some of the American military personnel did work 
in some provincial hospitals as part of the

09:40.227 --> 09:54.080
pacification program and you made rounds with 
guns there and you operated in your pod because

09:40.227 --> 09:54.080
that was not very secure. I had friends down in the 
Delta that routinely were shelled when they were

09:56.462 --> 10:10.015
operating.

10:11.193 --> 10:16.802
The naval facility up in Da Nang was interesting 
because it was up on the top of the rise. And on one

10:17.883 --> 10:23.231
side of the rise was the Monkey Mountain airfield, 
which was a marine airfield. And on the other side

10:24.073 --> 10:30.763
of the rise was a swamp that the VC owned. And the VC 
would sit in the swamp and shoot mortars over the

10:30.783 --> 10:36.171
hospital in the airfield. You know, the Navy has 
flag of regression here and there. They were up

10:41.684 --> 10:44.107
there working like slaves, people shooting at 
them. But when it came time to eat, they'd go down

10:44.828 --> 10:51.415
and they'd sit down at the table and the Philippine 
busboys would serve them and they would eat off

10:44.828 --> 10:51.415
China. You know, act like a gentleman for 45 
minutes and then go back to the war. But I was, at

10:57.161 --> 11:02.867
Cameron, I was really sort of in the womb. But it 
certainly wasn't that way all over. People in

11:06.342 --> 11:09.807
Pleiku got hit several times.

11:12.631 --> 11:14.093
Denying was never secure. Saigon got pretty crazy 
at the end. And then the guys out in the aid stations

11:18.079 --> 11:26.452
and all, they were in constant power,

11:18.079 --> 11:26.452
I would imagine. Ever since the Civil War, I've 
been looking at the different wars through

11:26.472 --> 11:32.601
Vietnam. Each war makes remarkable advancements 
in sanitation habits, of course. In a civil war,

11:39.124 --> 11:43.690
the majority of the people died because of poor 
sanitation. And I know that Vietnam, that it was

11:44.451 --> 11:50.299
much, much more improved than that. But was there 
still a problem with unsanitary? Not in any of the

11:55.746 --> 11:57.488
areas that I went. Not in the United States 
military areas. Some provincial hospitals, not

12:00.880 --> 12:08.609
the little we desired in the 80s, but no, I don't 
think so. That's what I expected. When we went up to

12:13.635 --> 12:19.442
410 there, the Air Force sent you to the field 
service school or whatever. They teach you how to

12:19.462 --> 12:24.688
wear the uniform, how to sleep, how to be an 
officer, a gentleman. And they taught you how

12:25.730 --> 12:26.871
to... build sanitary things for urinals and 
latrines and what-not. But to my certain

12:34.221 --> 12:37.865
knowledge, I never went in plus bid. I went in flush 
toilets, running water, and foam bid. Was the

12:45.174 --> 12:51.622
number of doctors and medics adequate for the 
amount of casualties you all encountered? It was,

12:51.642 --> 12:55.407
except during the Tet Offensive in 68. And that was 
tough.

13:01.581 --> 13:05.126
But most of the time, most of the places that I went, 
they had doctors standing around. You don't have

13:06.187 --> 13:13.296
any idea about a guess on the patient to doctor 
ratio? No, I can't give you a number

13:13.356 --> 13:21.587
on that. Speaking about the personnel, how was the 
quality of Many of the people didn't volunteer,

13:26.605 --> 13:33.633
but were drafted, I suppose.

13:33.654 --> 13:35.135
They're generally good quality doctors. Yes. 
Yeah. They're good quality. I think I saw very

13:39.621 --> 13:43.565
little drug abuse. That one guy that I'm almost 
certain was smoking pot. I don't know of any that

13:49.533 --> 13:52.096
were taking hard drugs. Alcohol abuse was pretty 
prevalent. But the

13:58.145 --> 14:12.140
people that were in position, command, whatever 
you want to call it, were all fully trained, good

13:58.145 --> 14:12.140
people. Mainly because of the beer plant, because 
they'd been able to get people who had already

14:14.603 --> 14:23.152
completed their training and were well qualified 
in their specialties. And the people who had just

14:23.172 --> 14:27.156
had an internship or one year of residency were 
assigned as general medical officers and they

14:28.402 --> 14:41.199
were in dispensaries and seeing colds and 
gonorrhea and just kind of like the clinic at home.

14:42.320 --> 14:49.149
And so I think the quality of the medicine that was 
available was excellent. Was there much

14:49.169 --> 14:55.978
difference between the drafted and the people who 
got in for a career or volunteered? Well, it's back

14:57.848 --> 15:00.131
to the MASH philosophy. Most of us did not have a 
great deal of respect for the regular Army medical

15:01.392 --> 15:07.981
officers. Some of them were really excellent 
people, but most of them were not as well trained as

15:10.003 --> 15:24.261
people that were going to be back into the civilian 
force. They weren't as well motivated. Some of

15:28.291 --> 15:38.389
them had been, you know, it's hard to be judgmental 
about them because they'd been stuck at desk jobs

15:28.291 --> 15:38.389
and not practicing medicine for years. My first 
hospital commander in Vietnam was a guy that, when

15:40.833 --> 15:52.915
he got out of medical school, he did an internship 
in the service. He became a flight surgeon, where

15:54.650 --> 15:58.414
the only thing he saw were healthy young men. He got 
a degree in preventive medicine, which is fine,

15:59.716 --> 16:05.902
but it doesn't help you practice. It doesn't help 
you take care of sick people. Maybe it helps you

16:07.804 --> 16:14.011
keep people from getting sick, but that isn't much 
good when people are getting shot, because you

16:07.804 --> 16:14.011
can't prevent that kind of stuff. And one of our 
anesthesiologists told him that. He said, Jerry,

16:18.817 --> 16:24.623
the problem with this hospital is the boss has a 
degree in preventive medicine. And the only thing

16:24.940 --> 16:29.046
you do is go around here and prevent medicine. And I 
think that was the attitude that a lot of us had

16:29.066 --> 16:33.333
about the regular army guys. Some of them I thought 
were suboptimal. A large number of them had just

16:38.220 --> 16:42.246
been out of touch with clinical medicine for 
years. And a few of them were absolutely superb.

16:49.997 --> 16:53.783
Was there adequate medical supplies available in 
Vietnam? Yes. Was the equipment and supplies

16:54.794 --> 17:05.065
found there very comparable to what you would find 
in an American hospital at the time?

17:08.589 --> 17:19.281
I had almost everything I wanted and if I didn't 
have it I could use it

17:08.589 --> 17:19.281
again. Generally, a patient could survive in a 
military hospital in Vietnam as easily as they

17:20.122 --> 17:28.874
would have been in a hospital.

17:31.578 --> 17:45.657
I think care of the critically wounded patient in

17:31.578 --> 17:45.657
the average military hospital in Vietnam was 
probably better. than it is in the average

17:46.261 --> 17:53.329
civilian hospital in the United States because 
they're attuned to taking care of critically sick

17:46.261 --> 17:53.329
people. They don't have anybody in there with 
headaches and constipation. They've got people

17:57.113 --> 17:58.414
that have died. And the corpsmen and the nurses and 
the physicians, everybody was attuned to

17:59.395 --> 18:12.910
getting on it and taking care of bad problems and 
not being afraid of anything. That's a problem a

18:13.683 --> 18:15.986
lot of people have taken care of sick people. 
They're scared of them. Oh, he's dying. He's

18:19.710 --> 18:20.110
dying. You can't hurt him. You can try to do 
something for him. That's sort of the attitude

18:22.553 --> 18:25.176
that most of the people had. The Navy Corpsmen were 
absolutely superb. I was, first place, they were

18:28.299 --> 18:35.267
up there with the Marines and our Corps really 
getting shot up bad. And a lot of them did get shot

18:37.189 --> 18:42.795
and then evacuated them down to us for secondary 
care. and kept them until they were ready to go back

18:43.771 --> 18:46.274
to duty. I probably kept the Navy corpsmen a little 
longer than I should have. Number one, because

18:52.340 --> 18:54.602
they didn't want to go back and get shot anymore. 
Number two, they sure were good help. I loved

18:56.785 --> 19:02.911
having them around.

19:05.113 --> 19:08.817
With the nature of the war injuries, I read an 
article on the number of injuries contributed to

19:10.366 --> 19:14.332
gunshot, or whatever. I know that much blood was 
needed to replace the lost blood. Was that ever a

19:19.901 --> 19:21.644
problem, finding enough blood? It never was at 
Cameron.

19:28.935 --> 19:32.160
I didn't hear it talked about a lot. I had my 
secretary looking for a little booklet. Let me

19:36.026 --> 19:38.550
give you the title of it. called the Second 
Syncopac, C-I-N-C-P-A-C, Surgical Conference,

19:40.555 --> 19:52.035
John Hay Air Base, Philippines, 25-28 March, 
1968. This

19:52.235 --> 19:59.087
was a deal the military put together. Those of us in 
country didn't know what was happening to people.

20:03.305 --> 20:12.597
You know, patch them up and then they'd go to a 
casualty staging unit and get on the C-141 and

20:03.305 --> 20:12.597
they'd go to the Philippines or Japan to 
convalesce. And we didn't know what our results

20:12.637 --> 20:14.680
were. And the guys in the Western Pacific didn't 
know what we had done because the records we got

20:15.581 --> 20:28.138
lost so often and the records were so skimpy. So 
they put this conference together in the

20:30.117 --> 20:43.060
Philippines, so those of us in country that were 
taking care of people initially could get

20:30.117 --> 20:43.060
together with the people that were giving them 
tertiary

20:30.117 --> 20:43.060
care. And I can't find my copy of the thing,

20:44.703 --> 20:51.535
but I have Daphne looking for it. As I recall, it's 
pretty good and could probably answer some of

20:51.970 --> 20:56.396
those questions you have. If we're not able to find 
it, we might can get it through the government

20:56.416 --> 21:00.923
printing office or Surgeon General's office. 
We'll look for it if we want. Okay, good deal. I

21:07.352 --> 21:13.741
mentioned that I'd seen some statistics, but at 
your hospital, what were the prevalent injuries

21:07.352 --> 21:13.741
due to combat?

21:17.647 --> 21:17.747
Okay. Uh... In what location? What type? What was 
the cause of it? The vast majority of them were

21:24.244 --> 21:36.619
fragmentation wounds that made it

21:24.244 --> 21:36.619
in. And the vast majority were by and large

21:36.719 --> 21:48.454
soft tissue wounds.

21:56.922 --> 22:00.987
Yeah, I had a big orthopedic service. I had a big 
orthopedic service.

22:06.895 --> 22:26.440
I'm being a little vague about that because our 
hospital we

22:06.895 --> 22:26.440
had the 12th USAF hospital and then the 22nd 
Casualty Staging Flight and physically they were

22:06.895 --> 22:26.440
in the same building but on paper they were two 
separate commands and I got confused about the

22:28.310 --> 22:39.583
evacuees that were coming into the casualty 
staging flight, which we had to go over and

22:28.310 --> 22:39.583
stabilize and be sure things were all right and 
send them over, and then the ones that were in the

22:28.310 --> 22:39.583
hospital itself.

22:45.350 --> 22:48.454
What were the prevalent diseases not related to 
combat? Hilarious.

22:52.339 --> 22:56.764
And it got to be a problem because down in the south, 
the

22:58.077 --> 23:27.510
plasmodium vivax was the real malaria bug and the 
prophylaxis for it was excellent and if you took

22:58.077 --> 23:27.510
your chloroquine and bremoquine you didn't get 
vivax malaria

22:58.077 --> 23:27.510
and if you did get it you got vivax malaria and you 
got over it but up in the north They had a different

23:28.013 --> 23:33.162
bug, as I recall, it was falciparum malaria. And it 
was a bad actor. It really was a bad actor. And

23:40.915 --> 23:45.403
initially, every time you got malaria, you got 
shipped out of the country. And the kids didn't

23:46.925 --> 23:53.717
want to be there, found out about that, and they 
quit taking chloroquine and primicune because

23:46.925 --> 23:53.717
all their friends had had Plasmodium bivax 
malaria, and they got sick, and they got sent to

23:54.507 --> 24:03.080
Japan, and they got well, and they were out of the 
country, and that was great, so they wouldn't take

23:54.507 --> 24:03.080
it. But then they got an I-Corps, and they got the 
damn falciferum stuff, and they started dying

24:03.721 --> 24:07.948
from it. And to sort of break that habit up, the Army 
put a big 6,000-bed malaria hospital, 6,000 beds,

24:09.650 --> 24:20.447
a major hospital, down on the sands bed out of 
Cameroon. Just so malaria wasn't a ticket out of

24:20.984 --> 24:25.769
the country.

24:29.413 --> 24:34.759
Why catch it if you're going to have to stay in 
Vietnam anyway? But that was a bad problem.

24:39.964 --> 24:46.131
All my readings I've done so far, most of them have 
come from the 60s, early 70s. They seemed to shy

24:46.668 --> 24:48.470
away from VD. I don't know why they do that, but they 
just don't talk about it much. But I know it was a

24:52.315 --> 24:54.177
major problem. Very common. And they had some 
strains of gonococcus that were imported from

24:57.761 --> 25:07.652
Thailand. Extremely resistant to all the 
antibiotics we had at the time. I did not get

25:10.996 --> 25:16.202
involved in treating much VD, fortunately. But 
the GMOs were pulling their hair out with some of

25:16.958 --> 25:26.733
the strains of gonorrhea that were coming through 
there because they were just resistant to

25:16.958 --> 25:26.733
everything we had. I don't think you could have 
shot them with that. Was there any steps taken to

25:31.460 --> 25:36.729
prevent what you know about them? Well, what can 
you do? They weren't.

25:42.458 --> 25:45.362
One of the standbys civilian

25:45.882 --> 25:59.784
world, a guy that knows he's going to go someplace 
where he's going to be exposed, he'll get the old

25:45.882 --> 25:59.784
friendly doc to give him some no-sweat pills, you 
know, some antibiotics to take before he goes. I

26:00.405 --> 26:01.567
don't think that was done.

26:04.933 --> 26:10.101
Mostly it was a matter of trying to educate people, 
but you've got to... a bunch of 18, 19-year-old

26:11.617 --> 26:23.031
kids that have been over there getting shot at, and 
send them to Bangkok, and somebody says, GI, you

26:11.617 --> 26:23.031
seem to be a movie star. And she's a good-looking 
little thing. It's hard not to get exposed to some

26:24.613 --> 26:33.264
of those things, particularly to tell you how 
wonderful you are and how good-looking you are and

26:24.613 --> 26:33.264
what a war hero you are. It was a bad problem. Most 
people who came down with renal disease, did they

26:38.684 --> 26:49.534
not see any more combat, or did they usually get 
treated and then went back to war? Treated and then

26:49.554 --> 26:49.994
back. And if they had one of the strains, the policy 
was you could not come home as long as you were

26:50.014 --> 27:06.649
infectious,

26:50.014 --> 27:06.649
which made people behave on their last R&R usually

26:50.014 --> 27:06.649
anyway. Like the earlier wars... I don't know if 
that was really policy or not. That was certainly

27:12.573 --> 27:14.896
what everyone was threatened with. No, I remember 
reading something like that, but they couldn't

27:14.916 --> 27:17.098
come in. Certainly should have been.

27:24.045 --> 27:25.046
Infection. I don't know if that was a problem in the 
earlier wars. How big of a problem was it in

27:26.547 --> 27:28.109
Vietnam?

27:31.792 --> 27:32.913
Pretty much have it under control.

27:35.836 --> 27:36.577
Yeah, I think so. I think the... the experience in 
treatment of soft tissue injuries in earlier

27:39.721 --> 27:49.314
wars, that is, you know, clean them up and leave 
them open, uh, stood us in awfully good stead. And

27:49.394 --> 28:02.752
then the first real war in the antibiotic area, uh, 
era, uh, was Vietnam and decent antibiotics, I

27:49.394 --> 28:02.752
guess, in Korea. Now I don't, I don't think, uh, It 
certainly wasn't the horror that it was, say, in

28:09.252 --> 28:25.334
the Civil War and the First World War and the early 
wars, because the wounds were... We learned that

28:09.252 --> 28:25.334
the other wars had taught us how to handle wounds. 
Obviously, there was some, but if you'd leave them

28:25.354 --> 28:29.880
open, they'd usually be open. What drugs, 
antibiotics, whatever, did y'all use mostly? Oh,

28:35.047 --> 28:38.432
I guess ampicillin was probably... Big drug 
there. Tetracyclines were useful. Penicillin.

28:45.423 --> 28:46.044
It's amazing. Penicillin's still the best 
antibiotic around. It was the first one we really

28:49.268 --> 28:51.210
came up with. Chloramphenicol. Chloramycin, 
whatever you want to call it. It's sort of...

28:58.700 --> 29:05.148
Chloramphenicol got a bad rap for a long time 
because of the blood disgraces it causes. It's

29:05.408 --> 29:06.850
super antibiotic. It really kind of salvaged some 
of its reputation in Vietnam, and I think it's

29:09.091 --> 29:20.804
probably being used more now than it was 20 years 
ago.

29:22.266 --> 29:25.710
What drugs or therapy was used to reduce pain? What 
do you mean? What do you mean? I'm sure so many So

29:37.627 --> 29:42.653
many guys get used to using

29:37.627 --> 29:42.653
trade names. And Demerol slips off the tongue 
easily. And a lot of Demerol is used. We use

29:49.921 --> 29:52.223
morphine primarily. It's extremely effective. 
It's extremely cheap. Was it readily available?

29:58.570 --> 30:01.193
Was there always being relief available? Yes.

30:04.296 --> 30:06.739
How much? of the diseases would you attribute to 
being in

30:07.445 --> 30:17.199
Vietnam? How much did they get because they were 
there that they wouldn't have gotten if they had

30:17.219 --> 30:22.968
been somewhere else? Being involved strictly 
with surgery, I just don't think I can answer that

30:23.088 --> 30:28.656
question.

30:32.001 --> 30:36.608
OK.

30:32.001 --> 30:36.608
Psychiatric. people who were admitted for 
psychiatric reasons, what percentage, just to

30:37.263 --> 30:53.238
round about guess, were admitted to the hospital 
you were at for psychiatric reasons?

30:53.258 --> 30:57.663
Oh, if I were just guessing, I'd say 8% to 12%. I 
don't know if we did. I don't think we did. Three

31:03.408 --> 31:04.109
shrinks. I don't know. That's just a hip shot, I 
don't know. It seems to me like they just had one

31:10.881 --> 31:20.195
ward, and we had, as I recall, 12 wards, so that's 
where I came in. I guess more importantly than how

31:20.215 --> 31:27.065
many was, did this number change over the time that 
you were there? Towards the end of your period

31:27.626 --> 31:31.992
there, did you see a lot more people coming in 
besides captains?

31:36.764 --> 31:40.008
I don't think so. The only place I would have seen 
them would be in the casket staging flights. And

31:47.696 --> 31:53.623
those would have been the only ones that were 
really grossly psychotic, unable to function.

31:53.943 --> 32:06.197
The guys that were just banged up in the head 
because of what was going on every day were

31:53.943 --> 32:06.197
probably still able to get by and were treated 
locally. And I really don't know what sort of

32:06.599 --> 32:20.358
outpatient load their psychiatrist

32:06.599 --> 32:20.358
had.

32:20.378 --> 32:25.745
What was the approximate survival rate of 
patients that were wounded? Another guest

32:25.765 --> 32:31.753
speaker.

32:31.773 --> 32:36.319
We didn't lose many that made it to the hospital, 
but I don't know I don't know how many went straight

32:37.058 --> 32:43.127
to the morgue or the helicopter. Yeah, that's the 
main thing. Those that made it to the hospital. The

32:48.115 --> 32:50.278
Bible was excellent that much.

32:57.890 --> 33:04.500
Of those that were admitted to the hospital, was 
the majority returned to further combat, or were

32:57.890 --> 33:04.500
they... with the majority? I would imagine the 
majority went back to work.

33:14.913 --> 33:16.155
I'm almost certain of that. Again, it's hard to 
make that judgment because none of them that came

33:16.175 --> 33:20.902
through the Casta Station flight were going back. 
They were all going to Japan or the Philippines and

33:20.923 --> 33:26.672
probably going back to that.

33:30.598 --> 33:30.758
Okay. You've already said a few things about the 
evacuation system in Vietnam, and I've read

33:32.932 --> 33:41.563
almost everything I've read praises that. Can you 
tell me a little bit about the helicopter

33:43.105 --> 33:46.068
evacuation system? I don't know if you worked much 
with it, but I know that most of your patients came

33:46.088 --> 33:51.735
from that. How did it work?

33:56.361 --> 33:58.083
The guys that flew those things were all crazy. 
They'd do anything to get you out of the vehicle.

34:02.412 --> 34:03.793
Very dedicated people. I don't know what their 
capacity rate was, but I suspect it was higher than

34:03.813 --> 34:19.049
almost anybody else, except maybe the Marine 
second lieutenant.

34:19.069 --> 34:20.890
They'd get called in, and they'd go. And they'd 
bring in as much as they could. And

34:25.455 --> 34:32.402
had the greatest respect in the world for those 
men. I lost some very good friends flying those

34:32.973 --> 34:39.039
things. I thought that was to help people get 
killed, to

34:39.059 --> 34:46.547
try to keep up with people dying. And then the 
outpatient, or the outpatient, the outcountry

34:46.567 --> 34:51.412
evacuation system was excellent. The planes were 
all well equipped.

34:55.957 --> 35:01.422
I flew one of them a couple of times, and it was sort 
of like being in a hospital. The big C-141. That

35:04.073 --> 35:21.444
C-9A Nightingale, WC-9A

35:04.073 --> 35:21.444
was modified as a patient carries

35:04.073 --> 35:21.444
a flying ambulance. It was a superbly designed 
ambulance.

35:32.272 --> 35:52.671
That was the biggest improvement over

35:32.272 --> 35:52.671
earlier

35:32.272 --> 35:52.671
wars like Korea. Can you think of anything else 
that was an improvement, medical-wise, over,

35:52.891 --> 36:00.118
say, Korea?

36:03.507 --> 36:30.932
I think in my field,

36:03.507 --> 36:30.932
in chest and vascular surgery,

36:03.507 --> 36:30.932
I think my generation of military surgeons owed 
such a tremendous debt to the guys that were in

36:03.507 --> 36:30.932
Korea, because that's where they started 
learning how to handle vascular wounds. and the

36:32.060 --> 36:40.671
changes in philosophy about how to handle chest 
wounds was

36:32.060 --> 36:40.671
very important for it. See, all those young guys 
that would have been Trapper and Hawkeye, by the

36:40.691 --> 36:51.505
time Vietnam came around, they were all 
professors. Guys like Frank Spencer, just pick

36:53.287 --> 37:01.257
almost any guy that's professor in a major program 
right now, and the chances are he was either a

37:01.895 --> 37:20.065
Hawkeye

37:01.895 --> 37:20.065
or a Trapper.

37:20.085 --> 37:27.497
Can you think of any lessons that were learned as a 
result in medicine in Vietnam that had an effect on

37:20.085 --> 37:27.497
the future of medicine today?

37:39.037 --> 37:42.502
I'm not sure we made any great medical discoveries 
in Vietnam. If we didn't, it would be surprising

37:42.643 --> 37:54.641
because

37:42.643 --> 37:54.641
war has almost always been good for surgery. The 
surgeons have learned something down there every

37:54.661 --> 37:59.228
time they had to go to war. And I really don't know 
what we came up

37:59.248 --> 38:05.798
with. Probably As much as anything, we learned 
something about resuscitation of the severely

38:08.129 --> 38:31.136
injured person, getting blood volumes restored, 
and the importance of doing that.

38:31.416 --> 38:33.158
How to take care of the body. that the wound 
happened to be in. I don't think we made much

38:35.908 --> 38:46.442
improvement in wound care, but I think in general 
care of the wounded person probably did, as far as

38:35.908 --> 38:46.442
fluids and electrolytes.

38:50.087 --> 39:02.504
Learning the importance of acid-base balance, 
things that

38:50.087 --> 39:02.504
are pretty casual. I don't know. Is every soldier 
that joins the Air Force, is he trained in some way

39:04.660 --> 39:11.769
in first aid? Not just medical corps, I mean 
anybody who joins? I don't know. Well, the reason

39:17.837 --> 39:29.892
I'm asking is although the helicopter evacuation 
system saved many, many lives, I know that there's

39:17.837 --> 39:29.892
a lot of times that the helicopters couldn't get in 
there. an hour or two. And I've taken a few first aid

39:31.866 --> 39:35.752
and EMT classes. And they talk about the golden 
hour and stuff. The first hour after injury is the

39:38.696 --> 39:40.859
most important. And I was wondering why couldn't, 
I was thinking that maybe every soldier should be

39:41.560 --> 39:52.316
trained somehow in first aid just to apply the 
pressure at the right place or whatever. I suspect

39:52.616 --> 40:00.267
it's illogical to think that they all don't have 
some kind of basic first aid training.

40:01.900 --> 40:08.871
The heart of that situation, of course, is your 
corpsman.

40:08.891 --> 40:14.018
You know, in all the military movies, somebody 
gets shot, the first thing you hear them say is,

40:08.891 --> 40:14.018
corpsman! That's a good way to get in a lot of 
trouble with good military units. Because your

40:18.866 --> 40:23.172
commanding officer wants you to call that 
corpsman by his first name. Because when those

40:24.194 --> 40:29.081
other guys hear corpsman, they want to shoot the 
one that gets out. If you shoot him, you know, That

40:31.550 --> 40:45.366
makes your effective kill rate better if you can 
take care of the ones that's trying to hurt you,

40:31.550 --> 40:45.366
help you, wound you. I've known some Marine 
officers that will use you pretty good if you call

40:45.386 --> 40:47.288
for a corpsman. You better call for Fred, you know, 
if you ever, because he didn't want anybody, he

40:47.308 --> 40:53.975
didn't want anyone. He didn't want anybody who was 
called to work. I just started thinking about that

40:56.795 --> 41:07.755
when I read an article that said some people died 
just because of blood loss where they were thought

40:56.795 --> 41:07.755
to have stopped the pressure that could have 
prevented them. That's why I brought that up.

41:12.744 --> 41:17.352
Most people with rudimentary first aid training 
don't do it.

41:20.588 --> 41:21.950
Have you seen me out there? They put a tourniquet on 
a venous

41:21.970 --> 41:32.424
injury.

41:33.946 --> 41:43.058
How many, of course you weren't at a field 
hospital, so you might not have seen this, but I was

41:33.946 --> 41:43.058
wondering how many hypochondriacs, people who 
were looking for a way out of the war. A lot of them. I

41:46.363 --> 41:48.165
can't give you a number, but a lot of them. How did 
you deal with these? I said, I'm sorry, John, you

41:53.004 --> 41:55.868
know. I'm sorry you don't do well. I mean, I don't 
know what you're wrong with. You have to go back to

42:03.217 --> 42:03.778
work. That's easier in surgery.

42:07.743 --> 42:18.017
You'd have to be, you'd see the occasional guy that 
would picket an incision or something, you know,

42:07.743 --> 42:18.017
to get it infected or get it open.

42:26.300 --> 42:41.005
The policy in the Marine Corps is seven days, or at 
that time the policy in the Marine Corps was seven

42:26.300 --> 42:41.005
days after an appendectomy, you go back to the 
field, full duty, coach your pack, 40-yard march,

42:26.300 --> 42:41.005
whatever. And you see a lot of people that really, 
you know, they don't get well as quick as they

42:41.025 --> 42:47.015
should. That's motivation, I guess.

42:59.037 --> 43:07.671
Back

42:59.037 --> 43:07.671
to when you got, how long were you in Vietnam? One 
year. One year? And then you came back and you were

43:09.595 --> 43:13.701
still on the search when you came back? I

43:13.802 --> 43:22.155
was wondering how it was, life back at home for a 
doctor returning from Vietnam. Was it hard to find

43:22.176 --> 43:23.678
work? I was still in the Air Force. I went up to the 
Scott Air Force Base in Illinois for a year, which

43:29.233 --> 43:33.921
was really superb. I fought them. I didn't want to 
go down the middle of a corn patch, which is what

43:35.785 --> 43:39.912
Southern Illinois is. It was the Air Force Chief 
Referral Hospital for Pulmonary Disease, and it

43:40.567 --> 43:46.774
was like having a year of residency for me. It was 
super. And I don't think anybody had trouble

43:49.017 --> 43:56.546
finding a place to go practice after they got out of 
the service, after Vietnam. Your work. We know

43:59.529 --> 44:04.595
that some of the Vietnam vets, some people that 
have provided had a hard time back in society. I was

44:04.615 --> 44:06.878
just wondering if the doctors had the same 
problem. No, they didn't see the combat

44:07.617 --> 44:12.902
thing around there. I don't think so. I imagine...

44:21.009 --> 44:33.000
I imagine there's probably a higher incidence of 
the drug and alcohol

44:21.009 --> 44:33.000
abuse in the Middle East. I don't have any way to 
prove that. I've never seen any statistics on it. A

44:38.887 --> 44:51.744
lot of guys, you know, there were just a lot of guys, 
and not just medical officers, but everybody.

44:51.764 --> 44:53.026
They were either working or drunk.

44:58.714 --> 44:59.635
Maybe break that pattern.

45:04.542 --> 45:07.746
Speaking of addiction, was there any problem with 
the patients getting addicted to the morphine.

45:20.664 --> 45:29.796
I don't know if you saw any of South Vietnam's 
medical hospital, but did you see any? How did ours

45:30.517 --> 45:32.299
compare with theirs? I

45:34.372 --> 45:51.107
had been

45:34.372 --> 45:51.107
there shortly, and they asked me to go to the 
prevention hospital. I was not trying, and I went

45:51.127 --> 45:54.651
up there. At that time, TB was on the wane in this 
country. I'd been to the big VA hospital in

45:59.595 --> 46:02.758
Houston, and they had a lot of TB. And I must have 
seen three or four cases of tuberculosis in

46:03.751 --> 46:12.383
Cayman, Houston, which is pretty much from the 
mid-60s. I went up to the provincial hospital.

46:14.966 --> 46:18.010
They were trying that day, and they had 75 of them or 
more.

46:22.897 --> 46:30.467
A lot of leprosy, a lot

46:22.897 --> 46:30.467
of trachoma. Did a lot of South Vietnamese come to 
your hospital, or did they keep their own? You just

46:35.284 --> 46:39.408
have the Americans. No. The policy at our place was 
that people would go out into the villages and have

46:41.530 --> 46:50.058
a clinic, do what you could. We tried to help out in 
provincial hospitals, and then we had two

46:51.740 --> 46:57.045
civilian wards.

47:00.383 --> 47:03.888
I guess that was... I don't remember what they 
called that target,

47:03.908 --> 47:11.520
but... I'm not sure that... I don't think the Army 
maybe officially sanctioned filling up their

47:14.304 --> 47:23.437
bids with spades. Number one, because they were 
getting shot at a lot. And it was a good PR thing for

47:26.281 --> 47:30.087
us to do with the camera. I did a few parts, some 
congenital stuff. I had a lot of Vietnamese

47:37.990 --> 47:41.215
working that came on the air base. They came to work 
in cattle trucks, and they would turn them over

47:42.096 --> 47:47.725
from time to time and get a lot of trauma. So yeah, we 
sat there, basically.
