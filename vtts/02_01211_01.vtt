WEBVTT

00:03.406 --> 00:11.994
Okay, Jim, Billingsley, let's see, today is May 
the 9th, I think. Saturday is the 10th. I've got a

00:13.275 --> 00:14.456
calendar here. Saturday is the 10th, May the 10th, 
1997. Welcome to Jim Billingsley. And Jim, tell me

00:21.042 --> 00:23.084
your full name, please. Jimmy. Jimmy, is it right? 
Right, J-I-M-M-Y. That's your regular official

00:27.208 --> 00:29.070
name, okay. That is correct. Middle initial or 
name? L-I-L. L-I-S-L-E or L-Y? L-Y-S-L-E.

00:39.712 --> 00:49.406
L-Y-S-L-E.

00:39.712 --> 00:49.406
And where were you born?

00:54.794 --> 00:55.435
And what year? May I ask? In 1932. Okay. We're 
almost contemporaries. The Social Security

01:00.520 --> 01:10.369
Office has a different opinion of the day that I was 
born in July. Okay. All my life I thought it was the

01:11.110 --> 01:16.855
26th, but when I applied for Social Security they 
told me it was the 27th. Is that right? That's

01:17.376 --> 01:19.097
interesting. So, thank you. Okay. Within 24 
hours. And you're... Your parents were doing what

01:24.035 --> 01:26.038
in Fulton? Uh, he had been

01:26.940 --> 01:41.322
brought there some years before it was managed.

01:41.843 --> 01:42.223
Telephone office.

01:47.772 --> 01:49.234
With what telephone? Local? Southwest. 
Southwest Middletown. And, uh, that was in Gene

01:50.056 --> 01:50.837
Autry's time. And, uh, I don't know exactly when, 
but they moved there about that. And Gene Autry was

01:53.431 --> 01:56.535
a telegrapher? He was a telegrapher, uh-huh. With 
the, uh, with the Tahoe gun there, or with the

01:59.538 --> 02:03.022
railroad? Uh, I think the railroad. Yeah, I think 
so, because I had an uncle who was a telegrapher,

02:03.983 --> 02:08.489
and I remember that. I'm

02:08.509 --> 02:19.101
going to put that in the book, and I think that's... 
Also, there was another guy, an interesting now

02:19.958 --> 02:24.964
that he was there about that time. He may have even 
been the owner of P.J. Cochran,

02:27.126 --> 02:40.001
C-O-N-K-W-R-I-G-H-T, who later became the chief 
designer

02:27.126 --> 02:40.001
at the Oklahoma Chris. And later after that went to 
Princeton as their

02:40.021 --> 02:44.826
chief designer. But he was out of retirement then. 
He shared,

02:48.241 --> 03:06.358
I'm told, a

02:48.241 --> 03:06.358
studio with Redwood Gowdy, the Redwood Old Titans 
fan, in Chicago. That's the story. Yeah, Gowder,

03:09.501 --> 03:10.362
Gowder. Gowdy, G-O-W-D-Y. Okay,

03:11.884 --> 03:16.288
I've seen it, yeah. Yeah. And how long were you in 
Sepulchre? Until 1935, and was transferred

03:21.375 --> 03:29.923
to Tulsa. So then you grew up in Tulsa? Yeah, 
actually grew up in Tulsa. And did you go through

03:35.087 --> 03:39.491
high school and the whole business in Tulsa? Yeah, 
kindergarten through high school. And? And

03:44.855 --> 03:47.037
beyond that, actually, university. Wait, let

03:48.130 --> 04:03.737
me get this

03:48.130 --> 04:03.737
right. So you left After high school. Went to OSU. 
Went to OSU, okay. And then in service, and then

04:11.266 --> 04:21.542
came back to TU,

04:11.266 --> 04:21.542
and I finished there in 58. At Texas? No, Tulsa. At 
Tulsa, yeah. And you finished at Tulsa in 58? What

04:35.853 --> 04:38.758
were you in the service? In the Navy? No, I was in the 
Army. One of the only atomic artillery units. What

04:48.733 --> 04:50.116
was that? 280 millimeter field piece. It's

04:52.424 --> 05:04.299
the one that they fired the warhead, atomic 
warhead, down the corridor. It

05:04.319 --> 05:13.411
was a life magazine. You may remember the old 
picture. I think I may remember. It's got a gun in

05:15.814 --> 05:18.377
the foreground, and a 11-inch gun. And we never 
would get to Korea. That's interesting. Korea.

05:20.379 --> 05:20.720
Yeah, we're good. They signed the name on the gun 
before we... They shipped and they converted us

05:22.040 --> 05:45.785
to come

05:22.040 --> 05:45.785
to Mexico after

05:22.040 --> 05:45.785
that. Yes, I agree. Where'd you go in Germany? I 
lived in a town called Frankfurt. I don't know

05:47.347 --> 05:47.868
where it was. It was in the French sector. Not far 
from here. I don't know what properties got

05:48.849 --> 05:49.649
robbed. And out of work. But it was in the French 
sector. There was no German post in there. The

06:00.465 --> 06:03.968
Catholic post, they lived in the old German 
caserns. They used the old stone masonry facility

06:03.988 --> 06:08.953
for the Germans to build before World War I. No one 
was in Germany, was there? I think there were some

06:10.635 --> 06:14.199
of them, but... Heidelberg. Heidelberg. Yes, he 
was in Heidelberg. I think he was in Heidelberg. I

06:19.853 --> 06:21.595
think I've forgotten the wrong one. I've 
interviewed him just recently, but I can't

06:21.655 --> 06:23.657
remember what it is. But I do remember Heidelberg, 
and he was there three years, which was a good

06:23.897 --> 06:30.244
stint, as I recall. Well, I tell

06:30.264 --> 06:44.779
you, when I was in as a recruiter, he was still 
trying to get us all to be more than short-timers.

06:44.799 --> 06:44.899
Yeah. And

06:45.166 --> 07:01.004
they tried to get me, but I went through the pattern 
test and all that, and brought back your CES, and

06:45.166 --> 07:01.004
then I found out it was at least a four-year stay. 
And I told them, no, thank you. I had just gotten

07:01.665 --> 07:03.047
married, and I had a baby. So we've just been 
friends for interesting days, just to show you

07:03.067 --> 07:14.380
that. Yeah.

07:40.959 --> 07:41.059
Yeah. They watched the spirit here, and they went 
to Oklahoma City for a free industrial

07:43.486 --> 07:52.261
baseball game. And that guy came back. A couple of 
guys didn't leave the bus that day, downtown in

07:53.262 --> 07:58.491
Coliseum over there. And I guess it was CID, one of 
those guys, he was one of the guys, to get the guys to

07:58.893 --> 08:16.740
miss about seven hours. And I thought, you know, 
doing that stuff, I like Vietnam, you know, it's,

08:16.760 --> 08:20.045
you know, it's a protest, you know, I like that. 
Those guys are just going to go. Yeah. Well, my dad

08:22.309 --> 08:25.694
was here in the back for years. And so, my brother 
and I hadn't, No choice. We were in the service, so

08:28.609 --> 08:33.016
we could have planned it. And we did. My brother 
actually enlisted, but I went through all of this

08:33.977 --> 08:39.926
in my life. And all the K-fellas were supposed to 
stay in there. And it wouldn't have been bad. No, it

08:44.493 --> 08:46.536
wouldn't have been bad. So, when you get out of 
service, your service really got out early

08:46.556 --> 08:56.912
because Korea was over. and they were trying to get 
to me.

09:07.879 --> 09:14.606
They opened the window early, early late, so it was 
a two-year ditch. So I actually got back about a

09:14.626 --> 09:17.689
minute to you, and I got to Cal State. Were you still 
under

09:17.709 --> 09:22.213
the G.I. Bill? Uh-huh. Because, see, there was a 
drop in there, and I missed it. Well, of course I got

09:25.715 --> 09:30.641
an undergraduate degree, but then I was going to go 
back to law school when G.I. Bill, when G.I. Bill

09:31.683 --> 09:33.245
went out. Yeah. We were out of there. They closed it 
off because I don't know how they calculated that.

09:39.573 --> 09:42.377
If that had been in, I would have been a lawyer now, 
I'm sure. Yeah, because I had one year of law school

09:42.397 --> 09:46.322
already. There's hope for you yet. I was lucky. I 
was lucky by now. Really, I tell you. But... There

09:54.520 --> 09:58.305
was a cut-off, yeah, I remember that. Because 
there was still live combat action. They extended

10:04.452 --> 10:06.515
that. We could have easily ignored it. Some of us 
did. Some of them did come back and flash

10:10.179 --> 10:16.547
the flags. We were lucky. That's right. And then, 
so you went through Tulsa, finished in what? 58. In

10:24.153 --> 10:28.780
15, what kind of a degree? Really,

10:28.800 --> 10:39.477
it

10:28.800 --> 10:39.477
was commercial art. Reading, journalism, 
drawing. What, was that in the Department of Art?

10:42.462 --> 10:44.325
It was liberal arts. And, yeah, the Department of 
Art within that. It

10:50.950 --> 11:15.954
was headed by Alexander Hogue, who was a student. 
It's not been gone very long. In fact, some of these

11:16.575 --> 11:17.736
works are in the library of Austin. It was a 
technical oil spreader in Wichita during World

11:17.756 --> 11:19.017
War II. And

11:19.469 --> 11:41.103
when that was over, we started using art as a 
profession and then joined Tulsa. One of the

11:41.123 --> 11:42.345
faculty, our faculty there, was a negative 
person. The youth department was a negative

11:42.365 --> 11:43.226
person. And Brad Place, a good old Texan, was

11:45.237 --> 12:08.669
my advisor through those years. He was just 
recently, maybe not so recently, he's retired,

12:08.689 --> 12:10.371
but he's still in Pelman. And his daughter, 
interestingly, is Mary Kay Price, who was on

12:15.393 --> 12:17.536
Nash. She was one of the nurses on Nash. Anyway, she 
kind of, you know, bought a star. Anyway. Had you

12:30.636 --> 12:34.422
kind of grown up in art? Oh, yeah. Did you have high 
school art? No, I didn't. I was in drafting. I had

12:41.836 --> 12:45.120
two years of that.

12:53.910 --> 13:02.180
Yeah,

12:53.910 --> 13:02.180
it's good stuff. And S. L. Denverson back there at 
Bill Roberts High School was a buddy and got a job

13:02.200 --> 13:06.645
with George F. Kelly. company,

13:06.862 --> 13:10.907
which is an oil field. He was an oil field 
photographer. An entrepreneur that did mapping.

13:16.052 --> 13:26.664
Many of his motorized maps are still working

13:16.052 --> 13:26.664
now here in oil companies all over the Southwest. 
And what were you doing with an oil field? What was

13:28.947 --> 13:30.629
your job? Grassman. Production? Grassman. Post 
oil production maps. from weekly, Ira Reinhart's

13:35.043 --> 13:37.666
weekly report. It's the information source for 
the industry on current production. It's a weekly

13:46.978 --> 13:51.143
report, and we would post activities all over the 
Southwest. Now, as a production draftsman,

13:51.324 --> 13:56.210
you're doing the surface type? Yeah. This is 
topographic drafting. Okay. And I went from

14:02.026 --> 14:13.362
cycling around to... And I had this guy who did the 
subsurface draft, and, you know, he'd shoot those

14:02.026 --> 14:13.362
things off, and then he'd draw little squinty 
lines and say, here's what it's like down there. He

14:13.542 --> 14:15.385
hoped. He never knew. He, George Kelly, was so 
frustrated with the way Texas was laid out that he

14:17.027 --> 14:30.666
established what he called the Kelly Baseline, 
which is a a grid of townships

14:31.203 --> 14:59.134
and ranges in state texas and hoping that others 
would look up on this this means that locating

14:31.203 --> 14:59.134
things when he ran in descriptions like three 
cigars west of the old old stunt locating a well it

14:31.203 --> 14:59.134
left a little to be desired

14:31.203 --> 14:59.134
but he he did that and uh So you started

15:00.295 --> 15:11.548
with them when? The summer of 1950.

15:25.865 --> 15:28.007
And you stayed with them then? All through. I 
stayed with them that summer, and they went to A&M,

15:29.860 --> 15:38.651
the school, for three semesters. And then we got 
married, and I went into the service following

15:38.671 --> 15:49.424
August. But I worked for the Sun and World 
Companies Production Division there in Tulsa. as

15:55.139 --> 16:02.210
a math draftsman for about

15:55.139 --> 16:02.210
six months or so. Okay, and when you came back to 
service, you got your degree, and then after

16:02.230 --> 16:09.060
Tulsa, you resumed working with Kelly also. Okay, 
okay. The supplement. Okay. The GI Bill. Good,

16:12.265 --> 16:14.268
okay, gotcha. Okay,

16:14.288 --> 16:24.403
through...

16:14.288 --> 16:24.403
Then is when I joined, let's see, That's

16:26.290 --> 16:31.317
a good night. Sometime, I don't know, I think it was 
about 59, it was, I joined D.X. Sunrise, which is

16:34.981 --> 16:41.830
the old big company. Yeah. And still is basically a 
production brand. That's when I graduated as an

16:43.953 --> 16:49.761
artist, and I joined D.X. as a commercial artist, 
and advertised myself. Oh, okay.

16:59.652 --> 17:22.605
When I came out of the

16:59.652 --> 17:22.605
service, I took

16:59.652 --> 17:22.605
a battery of tests.

17:23.412 --> 17:28.418
We were at the VA office there on campus. I wasn't 
quite sure at the moment. I had a business

17:30.901 --> 17:33.243
curriculum set up. But I wasn't all that confident 
in that

17:34.805 --> 17:42.134
decision. So I went to VA and asked them to run me 
through the library test. It was about three days.

17:44.757 --> 17:45.277
Maybe you did it. No, I didn't. But I knew. I know 
which one that was. And the profile on that came out

17:47.860 --> 17:51.124
decidedly. Yeah,

17:51.492 --> 18:07.594
as opposed to fine arts. So I said, fine. I mean,

18:12.463 --> 18:19.671
we bar graphed them right now.

18:23.895 --> 18:24.395
And they're super strong. That's interesting. 
And so I said, OK. I thought, well, you know, I'm a

18:28.039 --> 18:30.061
parent. I'd still like to be a champion. That's 
interesting. It was not a bad move. Yeah. No, it

18:32.684 --> 18:33.344
made me so much happier. Yeah. And that was such a 
purely academic world. So there was a master to be

18:37.240 --> 18:43.227
served there. So you were with Sunway for until 
when?

18:52.038 --> 18:53.140
That's when I went to OU. Now how did you get to own 
that? I picked up an ad in the paper. There

19:01.338 --> 19:13.556
was nothing

19:01.338 --> 19:13.556
more than that. OU needed a designer.

19:17.482 --> 19:18.543
There were two there at the time. And then the 
editor, they called them. One of the few presses

19:25.053 --> 19:26.375
that called them. You were an art editor. You were 
either an assistant or associate art editor. And

19:28.844 --> 19:41.301
the art editor

19:28.844 --> 19:41.301
assignment was reserved for only special people. 
Okay.

19:48.230 --> 19:49.071
Like PJ Compton, who I mentioned before. Yeah, 
right. And so I started doing it as the assistant

19:49.351 --> 19:52.776
art editor, which was the designer and 
production. in those days and the editor the press

19:53.178 --> 20:15.760
editor director press

19:53.178 --> 20:15.760
editor director was the editor-in-chief

20:21.308 --> 20:26.494
And they were heavily Western American Indian. 
Oh, yes. That was their thing. Western Americana.

20:30.239 --> 20:36.026
And just about everywhere you went you saw Latin 
American culture. And how long did you stay with

20:38.149 --> 20:41.213
them? Four years? Oh, yes, six years. And then 
what? I went to Tennessee. Tennessee. And what led

20:48.301 --> 20:49.643
you to Tennessee? Money. Okay. And who's the 
director of Tennessee? His name is Lewis

20:58.209 --> 21:00.972
Igelhart. I-G-L-E. Is it L-E-W-I-S? Lewis. 
L-O-U-L-E. L-O-U-L-E. I-G-L-E-H-A-R-T. It's a

21:07.158 --> 21:13.124
small community, that's why I'm asking these 
names, because I know that you've seen these

21:07.158 --> 21:13.124
possible... Yeah. Igelhart. I-G-L-E-H-A-R-T.

21:18.029 --> 21:18.169
Right. Great job. And so you went to Knoxville... 
in roughly 1968.

21:26.606 --> 21:31.293
And were you the design editor, or what did they 
call you there? The press in France was really

21:31.453 --> 21:45.012
established back in 1940 or 42, and the press 
hadn't really grown, and they weren't developed,

21:31.453 --> 21:45.012
but the university decided He

21:45.565 --> 22:00.020
was moving up fast and he was a provost or something 
at Tennessee before he came here. That was in the

22:00.040 --> 22:01.161
70s. That was Andy Colt. He was president

22:03.103 --> 22:15.015
at that

22:03.103 --> 22:15.015
time. And,

22:15.923 --> 22:35.089
uh... That's okay, I'm not, I'm just going to do it 
more for my own benefit than... Just, I was trying

22:15.923 --> 22:35.089
to

22:15.923 --> 22:35.089
finish. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, sure.

22:41.638 --> 22:43.821
And so, you were at, uh... Tennessee then from 68 
until?

22:52.482 --> 22:53.984
86. Now. How come you left Tennessee and came to 
Pennsylvania? Really long ago? Yeah. I won't put

23:02.838 --> 23:05.843
it in front of you.

23:09.265 --> 23:34.783
I

23:09.265 --> 23:34.783
think it's shared by open gate to feminism in order 
to, I always felt, along with others, they had to do

23:35.287 --> 23:48.427
that to get federal funding for their projects. I 
mean, it's a reality. And the director's job, when

23:50.490 --> 23:57.801
Lewis retired, started out well, but after a few 
years, it was bad. I

23:58.186 --> 24:18.707
was the last male member on that staff, just when I 
left. In fact, Lamar Alexander, who we know now as

24:18.727 --> 24:22.091
the former educational secretary of the Bush, was 
president, years since I was president, after

24:18.727 --> 24:22.091
Bowling was fired, I guess. I ain't told. When he 
and his wife made their initial visit to the campus

24:23.228 --> 24:44.796
units, they came to the press, and his wife, as they 
left, his wife, Honey, turned to someone and said,

24:23.228 --> 24:44.796
where are the men? And there weren't any. So, I can 
imagine what happened. I'm just saying, do you see

24:49.402 --> 24:52.206
exactly what you're telling me to say? what

24:52.810 --> 25:22.446
happened

24:52.810 --> 25:22.446
there, and I, when they were exploring, possibly 
the prospect of her coming, she was coming from

24:52.810 --> 25:22.446
Princeton, and that was good, and like many other 
outland press, universities and press like we

24:52.810 --> 25:22.446
are, in Tennessee, and were certainly, they 
unfortunately thought they wanted to be That's

25:22.814 --> 25:30.900
why I'm

25:22.814 --> 25:30.900
working on those taxes. Yeah. Okay. There you go. 
And he said so in no uncertain terms in his letters.

25:37.913 --> 25:38.174
Really? Oh, yeah. They're classic. Some of them 
are really good. Right, yeah. I always knew I liked

25:41.720 --> 25:43.323
them. Yeah. But I tell you, the cultural shock 
there was just something dealt with. And I think

25:50.696 --> 25:55.605
it's a disservice to everyone concerned because 
in the end, they recruit from them. I can live and

25:55.822 --> 26:08.376
stick them out here in the boonies that these 
people don't understand, and there's no other

25:55.822 --> 26:08.376
ways, or, you know, anything about getting back to 
where you live after a little while. That's right.

26:08.936 --> 26:09.317
Especially at A&M. I've been at A&M more so than 
business in the past. And it's part of the richness

26:13.181 --> 26:17.286
of A&M to me. The tradition is still here, and it's 
protected for so long. But you can only stand up

26:21.410 --> 26:25.795
there for so long and protect that. So, how did you 
pick up on a job here? Well, I had been raised with

26:30.506 --> 26:42.638
Milo, who was the first owner to that company, 
designer and production manager. He had been

26:44.300 --> 26:55.090
needing help as the list grew from time to time, 
which led him outside

26:44.300 --> 26:55.090
to And a lot of us did this. We'd say the name 
ourselves, you know, and help. Anyway, we were

27:06.485 --> 27:16.605
talking and somehow I learned to help and I was 
always willing to help. And it was like all the

27:16.585 --> 27:29.167
Indian books at Oklahoma.

27:29.347 --> 27:38.262
By the time I left Oklahoma, I felt like it had been 
my last Indian book. I had drained. anyway i didn't

27:43.484 --> 28:05.256
know he was into

27:43.484 --> 28:05.256
urban history uh it was natural

27:43.484 --> 28:05.256
history

27:43.484 --> 28:05.256
and uh Well, it seems to me there's a good book on 
Memphis or something. A classic in urban history

28:14.913 --> 28:19.638
at the time. That's the book. In fact, I remember 
that book. That was a good book. Really

28:25.565 --> 28:27.227
interesting. We actually

28:28.237 --> 28:52.033
did the first, they say, oral history on One of

28:52.469 --> 29:16.958
the first books in the office was

28:52.469 --> 29:16.958
formally published, and it had me on the saga's 
title, Saga of Coe Ridge, which was a little

28:52.469 --> 29:16.958
Melungeon mixed-race community in the Kenny 
Brown community on the northern Tennessee

28:52.469 --> 29:16.958
southern Kentucky border on the Cumberland 
River, which was a kind of a rich thing. And in that

29:17.444 --> 29:21.869
case, I'm going to have them actually 
photographed on site. Some of those little cabins

29:22.029 --> 29:33.261
and things that are up in here. So A&M, when did the 
flag come up from A&M? Ray Dine. Yeah. He was not

29:41.609 --> 29:54.862
well, and I didn't, I

29:41.609 --> 29:54.862
had several, I didn't help him.

29:59.606 --> 30:09.535
Uh, so anyway, I had to help him in, and the lawyers 
are noble. I don't know if I knew anybody, and I

30:09.555 --> 30:11.177
said, how about me? Because

30:12.085 --> 30:38.242
I was running out of guts, you know, out of 
patience, I guess, you know, with the situation.

30:38.262 --> 30:39.304
And, uh, we just rolled around and talked to 
people. I sure liked the people I saw. The

30:39.944 --> 30:40.786
facilities, the West, um, very famous. Good 
people. Okay, now, let's talk about Lloyd. I know

30:44.625 --> 30:47.330
Lloyd real well. I feel like I do. But I'm amazed. 
Lloyd, according to all the letter files, Lloyd

30:50.675 --> 30:54.801
was up to it. Apparently, I'm not putting words in 
your mouth, but he was on top of that. I never knew. I

31:00.370 --> 31:05.297
thought Lloyd was laid back, undirected kind of 
guy. And he crossed every T, apparently, in terms

31:05.998 --> 31:09.784
of administering the press. That was my attitude. 
Tell me about law. When you came, what did you find

31:11.940 --> 31:14.483
here? Tell me about A&M, too. You're in the county 
with A&M. Just kind of give me an impression of what

31:17.526 --> 31:21.872
you're walking into. Well, when you came, gosh, 
people just couldn't be nicer. You know,

31:29.701 --> 31:31.063
everybody...
