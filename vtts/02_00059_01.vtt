WEBVTT

00:03.035 --> 00:09.182
And I'm in the office here in Bryan of Mr. A.W. 
Davis, Sr.

00:09.343 --> 00:18.834
And we want to talk to him about his recollections 
of student life. OK. A.W. Davis, Jr. And now I'm

00:21.998 --> 00:27.805
going to stop and see if the machine's working. OK. 
First question. Why did you attend A&M in the first

00:29.767 --> 00:31.970
place? What led you here? What caused you to come to 
this place? My response would be, doctor, that

00:37.487 --> 00:49.942
during high school years, I really had intended to 
matriculate at Southern Methodist. Being a

00:50.082 --> 00:53.646
Methodist by tradition, that sounded good to me. 
And I suppose I would have done that save and except

00:54.748 --> 01:02.337
I had a first cousin who lived in Sherman. who was in 
the class of 44 and he visited me one day probably in

01:03.633 --> 01:24.637
my junior or senior year in high school probably 
senior and he said to me that he was a Baptist and he

01:03.633 --> 01:24.637
said Southern Methodist was not the place for you 
and you need to be at Texas A&M. I'm not sure I'd ever

01:24.657 --> 01:28.341
heard of Texas A&M before but I'd have to lay it on my 
cousin whose name is LT Davis. He turned out to be a

01:33.226 --> 01:50.728
long practicing veterinarian and as I said was in 
the class of 44 and now resides in Denison and I

01:33.226 --> 01:50.728
reminded him of that conversation within the past 
short months but that's the only reason I can

01:33.226 --> 01:50.728
assign. Did you come to visit before you came down 
to enroll? I came hitchhike down here in the

01:57.312 --> 02:01.138
spring. Beautiful weather, I recall, of 1941. 
There were a good handful of Wichita Falls boys at

02:04.963 --> 02:14.418
Texas A&M.

02:17.602 --> 02:24.012
Lord, there was Jimmy Handy, Jimmy Keel,

02:24.245 --> 02:25.727
A good half dozen here. And I paid them a visit. They 
were quartered mostly over in what we came to call

02:27.669 --> 02:33.295
the new area. And I did see them. And I suppose had 
the money to spend the night. And I don't know why I

02:40.804 --> 02:42.987
didn't stay in the dormitory with them. Probably 
could have. But I spent the night in a motel in the

02:43.828 --> 02:51.957
block immediately south of Brass County 
Courthouse as it was then and now. So I did visit

02:52.966 --> 02:55.289
here in the spring of 1941. What was your 
impression?

03:00.494 --> 03:02.276
Well, I was age 16. I thought

03:02.296 --> 03:09.384
it was a very peaceful place. I did not see very much 
of the Corps activities. Might have seen them

03:14.189 --> 03:16.872
march into the mess hall. I can't recall that, but I 
certainly had to notice those uniforms. And of

03:21.898 --> 03:22.939
course, It was the time to be thinking about a 
uniform, and I'm not sure I was thinking about

03:24.286 --> 03:39.542
anything, but it was the time, whether I was 
thinking or not, to see what kind of uniform you'd

03:24.286 --> 03:39.542
go wear. This was 1941. Did anybody promise you 
anything if you came here? No. Nobody gave you a

03:46.710 --> 03:47.972
sales pitch? No. I remember looking at the 
catalog. the library in the high school in Wichita

03:53.024 --> 04:07.120
Falls had a collection of catalogs and I looked at 
several of them and I can remember looking at one in

03:53.024 --> 04:07.120
regard to A&M College. Seemed to me the 
matriculation fee was $25. I can't believe that's

04:11.285 --> 04:17.653
correct but that's my memory. I read a little bit 
about it. I told some people around The high school

04:22.117 --> 04:39.561
that I was going to come to Texas A&M, I distinctly 
remember one fellow and one fellow only told me

04:22.117 --> 04:39.561
that I could come and stay in Texas A&M. Everybody 
else said I could not do that. This fellow,

04:42.645 --> 04:50.335
there were two pressing brothers that taught 
school. One was an assistant principal, and I

04:50.720 --> 04:54.204
believe that was A.K. Preston. My name was Fred in 
those days, and he said, Oh, Fred, you can do that.

04:59.451 --> 05:03.756
And I said, Mr. Preston, I'm getting ready to 
graduate in the third quarter of my class. He said,

05:04.277 --> 05:06.159
Yes, but you can do it. No one else, except my father 
and mother, they knew I could do anything, but they

05:06.179 --> 05:13.669
were highly prejudiced. Everybody else said I 
could not last at Texas A&M. It had a good

05:18.209 --> 05:22.133
reputation for people coming and some not 
staying. Alright, describe the campus

05:23.514 --> 05:28.099
physically when you arrived. What buildings were 
where?

05:32.824 --> 05:33.825
What did it look like? That's not real difficult to 
do. I imagine what we now know as Texas Avenue was

05:36.628 --> 05:45.617
probably a two-lane strip of concrete leading 
from Brian, College Station 2, Houston. I was, I

05:49.826 --> 06:00.000
can reflect now that the East Gate was every bit as 
pretty then to me as it is now. At the East Gate was

06:00.020 --> 06:05.869
the Blue Top Motel.

06:09.134 --> 06:12.759
Probably called Tourist Court then, I'm not sure, 
but that's kind of what it was. Blue Top motel, I'd

06:14.133 --> 06:19.418
call it, a number of little individual units. 
There was a restaurant at the East Gate in a

06:20.919 --> 06:37.255
building that I've since come to know was owned by 
George Ciceres, one of the outstanding members of

06:20.919 --> 06:37.255
a clan of Greek businessmen and women in Bryan and 
College. That was a restaurant. The building

06:39.137 --> 06:43.701
still stands and is still on this date in the 
Ciceres family. And Dr. Walton's old office, TT,

06:45.014 --> 06:49.400
was there.

06:52.184 --> 07:13.013
The semi-circular entrance to College Hills 
Estate, I remember being there and having some

06:52.184 --> 07:13.013
buildings, but the entrance to what I called the 
white building, in other words, the old standby

06:52.184 --> 07:13.013
administration building, was just as pretty then 
as it is now. I also like the petroleum engineering

07:13.921 --> 07:18.687
building. It had a beautiful,

07:18.707 --> 07:37.212
it's called a cupola, a structure on top of the 
functional building itself and I loved on let's

07:18.707 --> 07:37.212
say Tuesday and Thursday or it was Monday, 
Wednesday, and Friday I had a class in that

07:18.707 --> 07:37.212
building. And I'd do my best to go early and maybe 
even stay a little late because it was a grassy

07:37.900 --> 07:45.472
knoll there and I could look out and see the cars. 
Every now and then there'd be a car going down

07:46.234 --> 07:50.681
Highway 6 towards Navasota. And I'd think how nice 
it would be to be in one of those automobiles and get

07:51.562 --> 07:55.649
to go somewhere.

08:00.557 --> 08:02.440
Kyle Field, of course, was as it had been probably 
since the middle 30s. I can't be certain, but there

08:07.885 --> 08:12.710
were no second or third decks and so on. Beware 
Fieldhouse, of course, was there. An old building

08:16.876 --> 08:22.202
that I went to school in had a course in there. It was 
called Pfeiffer Hall. It had to be one of the oldest

08:24.385 --> 08:28.229
on the campus. It's now gone. Ross Hall. and Austin 
Hall were there. Ross Hall was the office of the

08:33.524 --> 08:36.589
commandant. And where were they located? Well, if 
one went out the west door of the academic building

08:38.492 --> 08:49.389
and looked towards the southern Pacific tracks, 
one was to the right and one was to the left in the

08:38.492 --> 08:49.389
same block. Gathright Hall was missing. 
Gathright was said to be, and I can't be accurate

08:52.173 --> 08:59.865
about this, but was said to be the oldest building 
on the campus. It was a common practice of the

09:00.807 --> 09:09.977
sophomores to say to a freshman, I want you to 
locate Gathright Hall. As a matter of fact,

09:10.978 --> 09:13.121
Gathright Hall was gone. There was a little marker 
on the former location of Gathright, which was

09:15.383 --> 09:27.777
adjacent to what was then called, and the building 
still stands, the student exchange. Of course,

09:29.393 --> 09:35.320
had a bugle stand out in front of Sabisa, and that 
meant something. Over in the new area, where the 12

09:37.322 --> 09:53.641
cell blocks are, at the northwest corner was a 
frame building, and in that building was what I'd

09:37.322 --> 09:53.641
call, and was called in those days, it was George's 
Confectionary. George McCullough owned that

09:54.622 --> 09:56.464
place. And he sat on a high stool and took nickels 
in. Occasionally dying. Post office was in the

10:01.945 --> 10:05.309
other end and there was a cleaner there. And you'd 
get hamburgers and fountain drinks there and so

10:07.372 --> 10:11.997
on. George McCullough later became a very good 
client of mine as his family has been for years and

10:12.017 --> 10:21.608
years.

10:23.579 --> 10:34.950
The dormitories opposite what was called Campus 
Theater at the North Gate,

10:23.579 --> 10:34.950
we call that the New New Area. There were four or 
five dormitories built in the spring or summer,

10:35.010 --> 10:41.316
spring, I suppose, in 1942. Other than that, the 
most recent dormitories on the campus has been the

10:41.476 --> 10:49.063
New Area, which is 12 dormitories. They were there 
in 1941. Just your impression of the academic

10:53.498 --> 10:57.062
building. Oh, I was in there a bunch. And it did 
appear to me that it was larger than Wichita Falls

11:01.627 --> 11:05.991
Senior High School, I'll say that. I had a lot of 
classes there. And it was enormous, and it was huge

11:10.656 --> 11:12.959
to me. And I'm glad it's still there. How were fish 
treated during your freshman year? Describe

11:20.767 --> 11:23.370
being a fish in 1941.

11:25.932 --> 11:26.573
That's easy. That is a part of my indelible memory.

11:35.420 --> 11:54.437
When I came here in September of 1941, I had been 
late registering, and I could not live with a

11:35.420 --> 11:54.437
military unit to which I had been assigned, which 
was 3rd Headquarters Battery on a field

11:35.420 --> 11:54.437
artillery, number four in the new area. I lived 
about 10 days in Bazell Hall, which was a part of the

11:55.210 --> 12:03.281
Coastal Artillery Regiment. And I soon asked 
somebody where Bazell Hall was, and I was

12:03.301 --> 12:22.066
approaching the building, and the sophomore 
fellow said to me, pick that footlocker up and

12:03.301 --> 12:22.066
follow me. And we went to the fourth floor of Bazell 
Hall. That was my orientation

12:25.720 --> 12:33.128
and from then on it went down. Freshman life at 
Texas A&M is hard to describe in a way that might be

12:35.751 --> 12:46.702
believed because people would be incredulous 
truly about what went on. Short of the

12:47.683 --> 12:54.090
incarceration of the Vietnam prisoners of war, it 
had to be the worst say, four to five months of

12:55.387 --> 13:02.336
existence has anybody ever lived in the free 
world. Do you want to hear more? A freshman wore a

13:05.601 --> 13:22.643
white strap on the cuff of their left sleeve, and 
that stayed on there the entire freshman year, and

13:05.601 --> 13:22.643
that entitled you to walk in the streets. did not 
entitle you to sit in any park bench on the Indian

13:24.158 --> 13:32.468
campus unless you were with a visitor. It entitled 
you to attend bleep meetings. Bleep meetings were

13:38.475 --> 13:50.790
orientation sessions conducted by sophomores in 
the halls of the dormitories whereupon you were

13:38.475 --> 13:50.790
instructed how to attend to your business. And 
those were important instructions in a sense. And

13:56.383 --> 13:59.687
in another sense, even if you followed them, it got 
you nowhere. You were in a heck of a mess until they

14:00.167 --> 14:07.816
eased up, say, in March of our freshman year. Every 
now and then, a freshman would commit an error of

14:09.899 --> 14:21.132
commission or omission of sufficient magnitude 
to even get the juniors and seniors involved. And

14:25.286 --> 14:30.754
when that happened, it was truly the end of the 
world. As far as I know, every unit on the campus,

14:30.774 --> 14:39.086
and certainly the one I was in, believed in liberal 
applications of the board. That meant a baseball

14:40.809 --> 14:52.165
bat

14:40.809 --> 14:52.165
trimmed to a smooth surface in the middle of the 
bat. And it, at least that's what it resembled. And

14:58.100 --> 15:04.587
these boards were prevalent, most of them in the 
hands of softball. And they would tell you to grab a

15:04.607 --> 15:08.972
pooch. That meant that you would tighten the 
muscles in your rumpus and turn your rumpus to

15:10.374 --> 15:15.399
them. And they would administer three severe legs 
to your posterior anatomy and it hurt. But that was

15:25.169 --> 15:26.811
the easiest part. The toughest part of it was the 
push-ups, holding the wall up, and all the other

15:26.831 --> 15:36.244
physical and mental things that went with it. It 
was severe. About how often did that occur? You

15:40.570 --> 15:41.912
mean the bleed meeting? Or at least once or twice a 
week.

15:47.967 --> 15:53.634
the application, were the number of bleed 
meetings comparatively similar unit to unit? I

15:54.635 --> 15:55.517
would think so. Of course, I was never in a unit. Oh, 
with minor exception except my own because you

16:00.202 --> 16:10.375
were obligated to go to class and you were 
obligated to do that. And you were obligated to

16:10.395 --> 16:14.721
come back to your room. You were allowed, of 
course, to go to the post office. That was

16:21.758 --> 16:23.961
accomplished to and from the classroom. You could 
go to some athletic events. That is to say, you

16:32.153 --> 16:38.543
certainly could go to a football game, but you 
couldn't go to all basketball games because there

16:32.153 --> 16:38.543
were certain study requirements. You had to be in 
your room with the door closed and that kind of

16:38.563 --> 16:42.869
thing. But you couldn't go up to the north gate 
unless a sophomore or a classmate was sending you

16:48.802 --> 16:51.565
Were freshman roommates special? Fish, old lady, 
did you have a special friend who? I roomed with a

16:57.492 --> 17:03.779
boy named Angus Dixon, who was a good student and a 
nice fellow from Terrell, Texas. I later roomed

17:04.600 --> 17:13.210
with Dickie Haas, my old partner from Corpus 
Christi, now deceased. Pete Slaughter came along

17:13.350 --> 17:15.512
somewhere. Boy, this was after the war. that I knew 
Pete best, a class of 44 boy from Houston. Oh, yes,

17:23.877 --> 17:31.590
you freshmen lived with freshmen, sophomores 
lived with sophomores, and so on. You were a room

17:31.610 --> 17:37.539
orderly to somebody, some upperclassmen. And you 
attended to making their beds and did not shine

17:37.559 --> 17:41.405
shoes. You did not do that. But you did make those 
beds, and you did police the room and as a matter of

17:46.784 --> 18:05.206
fact my clothes still hang in my closet with the 
coat hangers pointing all in one direction in a

17:46.784 --> 18:05.206
certain space from each other and it's just as 
orderly as it was in 1941 because they taught me

17:46.784 --> 18:05.206
very quickly. What about life in the in the dining 
hall? Describe dining in Duncan Hall I guess it was

18:09.451 --> 18:13.315
in your case.

18:15.961 --> 18:20.386
Everybody marched to the mess hall three times a 
day. There probably was some compulsion to that.

18:25.031 --> 18:29.436
Very few meals were missed, and there's more than 
one reason, as I recall. One of them was the food was

18:29.556 --> 18:32.459
excellent. The main food service fellow on the 
campus at that time was named Mr. Hotar. And he and

18:38.245 --> 18:42.770
his folks did a superior job. I remember it being 
excellent food. There was noise in the mess hall.

18:47.893 --> 18:49.736
It was family service. You, of course, had some 
strict things to observe. You weren't going to

18:53.802 --> 18:57.047
serve yourself before every upperclassman was 
served. But I don't recall a great deal of

18:58.108 --> 19:01.333
disturbance in the mess hall. They did allow you to 
eat. I ate well. Were there any names for various

19:05.439 --> 19:10.246
food items? Oh, yeah. I can't recall. Bonac was any 
kind of meat. like me saw was saying any kind of

19:16.694 --> 19:21.921
dessert was cush. It seems to me freshmen did not 
eat cushion until after Thanksgiving. That was

19:29.131 --> 19:33.857
supposed to help you beat Texas in football. Let me 
think. I think mustard was baby. I can't remember.

19:42.629 --> 19:43.891
I'm having difficulty with that. But they are 
pretty well named. I think Cal Yes, and bull

19:47.727 --> 19:53.674
wasn't, I think, any kind of bread. They all had 
names. Let's see, did you all ever attempt any

19:57.439 --> 20:01.544
pranks at mealtime? Any tricks, games? I devoted 
most of my subversive activity to trying to get

20:05.109 --> 20:12.558
Cush. I don't recall any organized activity in the 
mess hall. As a matter of fact, you could do what you

20:17.562 --> 20:21.786
wanted to, but you paid an enormous price. The 
freshman life at Texas A&M has been helpful to me

20:23.288 --> 20:35.299
because since then, I have been involved in 
numerous jams of all kinds. It seems like I can get

20:35.319 --> 20:42.266
in trouble and get my plow hung without any 
difficulty at all. And in the darkest moments, I

20:42.286 --> 20:44.228
will I have always been able to reflect this is not 
as bad as a fish year at A&M. It's given me a standard

20:51.286 --> 20:56.472
and I've never excelled at it. Was your outfit 
special to you as you look back in shaping you,

20:56.492 --> 21:01.237
forming you? There were some great and good fellas 
in third and head quarterback at the field

21:03.239 --> 21:09.085
artillery regiment. It only lasted and was in 
existence about four, perhaps five years,

21:16.540 --> 21:24.936
something had happened before I arrived that 
caused Third Headquarters Battery to be

21:16.540 --> 21:24.936
organized. And it, one of its, maybe its first 
commander was Billy Joel. Oh, mercy and

21:31.869 --> 21:35.216
embarrassment, Billy Joel. He taught an 
executive development course in the business

21:35.236 --> 21:39.544
college at A&M. For years and years. Billy Joe 
McAdams. Billy Joe Adams. Good guy. He had been the

21:45.521 --> 21:46.883
battery commander. He was gone when I arrived. 
Jack Taylor, a fellow from Irene, who was a good

21:49.586 --> 21:56.195
soldier, if there ever was one, was the battery 
commander. And after that was a fellow named Tudor

21:57.376 --> 22:03.043
Ball from Uvalde. And after that, a fellow named 
Bob Parker, who lived then at Robie, now lives in

22:03.063 --> 22:08.350
Paris, Texas. Yeah, it was a great outfit. We had 
good soldiers. Except for me. I had a difficult

22:14.854 --> 22:16.435
time. Take me, describe, if you will, a typical 
class day. When did it start? What happened when?

22:25.005 --> 22:25.946
When did it end?

22:29.170 --> 22:34.215
Well, in those days, by golly, it was not unusual. 
As a matter of fact, I'd say it was unusual that a

22:34.255 --> 22:38.640
student took 18 hours. That included a certain 
amount of military service.

22:46.327 --> 22:49.232
I didn't pass any of them, but I took them. And you 
certainly had to be up early in the morning. The

22:51.896 --> 23:00.832
hour escapes me, but you had to have time to get your 
room in shape and get your Lord and Master's room in

22:51.896 --> 23:00.832
shape. Did you wake up on your own? What awakened 
you? No, there was a bugle that was blown down in

23:04.437 --> 23:19.398
front of Duncan Hall and over the people in the 
other area, the older part of the campus at Bugle

23:04.437 --> 23:19.398
Stand, right by the old Calvary dormitories down 
from the space of it. You had to have that done by

23:22.223 --> 23:25.848
breakfast time, and then you marched to 
breakfast. You returned, probably brushed your

23:25.868 --> 23:32.117
teeth, got out in the free world going to class if 
you had an 8 o'clock class. classes then

23:33.110 --> 23:42.700
were Monday through Friday and Saturday morning. 
And sometime that week in the afternoon you would

23:42.720 --> 23:55.093
have a drill

23:42.720 --> 23:55.093
where the unit would participate in some kind of 
military exercise. Post-order drill or service

23:55.713 --> 24:00.298
of the peace or whatever it might have been. Where 
and how long would that occur? Where did you all

24:04.081 --> 24:07.166
drill? Close order drill would likely be 
conducted right in the dormitory area. But by the

24:12.473 --> 24:20.845
time I was a sophomore, perhaps even four, we would 
march down to the field artillery stables. My

24:21.066 --> 24:24.491
battery was a horse-drawn unit. And the cavalry 
and the field artillery had many horses. on what's

24:30.670 --> 24:33.153
now called the west campus. The staples were right 
west of the railroad tracks that now exist. And you

24:39.200 --> 24:47.831
would saddle those horses, put them on in the 
pieces, to pull the pieces. And you might go to the

24:47.851 --> 24:49.513
Brazzers spot. Other times, you'd run problems, 
military exercises for field artillery. in

24:59.105 --> 25:01.789
what's now called Hensel Park. Many times we've 
done that. And you learn how to operate

25:04.512 --> 25:09.760
a feel-like inner battery. If you had an 
unscheduled afternoon, what'd you do? I

25:14.486 --> 25:26.583
don't know that this speaks to the afternoon, but 
it certainly would speak to the early evening.

25:26.603 --> 25:28.285
Inner murals was a big part Texas A&M at the time had 
all kinds of intramural activities, and I don't

25:28.990 --> 25:38.159
know that you had to participate in it, but you were 
encouraged to do so. And they began in the late

25:38.840 --> 25:51.793
afternoon and so on before dinner that evening, 
softball, football, everything, boxing,

25:38.840 --> 25:51.793
whatever might have been the time to do. Was it 
easy, though, for a freshman to go over and sack out

25:52.113 --> 25:55.977
in the afternoon in his room? Oh, you didn't do 
that. Freshmen change places. That is to say, I had

25:59.864 --> 26:07.874
freshmen from the infantry regiment come to my 
room because my sophomores were not bothered. So I

26:08.996 --> 26:13.762
had to go over to their place and seek a little 
refuge. You did that occasionally. It wasn't

26:16.045 --> 26:22.233
altogether customary, but you could do that on 
occasion. All right, then now we're getting ready

26:22.254 --> 26:24.917
for supper. Tell me the routine of getting ready 
and whatever happened before supper. I thought

26:31.184 --> 26:32.685
that was a great time. You knew what time that event 
was going to go down. And you assembled in the

26:38.431 --> 26:48.141
battery area, the battery walk, let's say, that 
led directly to Duncan. And Captain Jack Taylor

26:48.161 --> 26:52.525
would take his position. field artillery 
regiment on the west and the infantry regiment on

26:53.720 --> 26:58.848
the east. And dormitory,

27:00.330 --> 27:11.006
I guess, dormitory on the east closest to Duncan 
Hall would be 11. I believe that's correct. The

27:13.110 --> 27:15.453
band was there in those days. 12 was occupied by the 
scholarship athletes. At a later time they were

27:21.462 --> 27:22.905
moved into the units. But at that time, early 
freshman days, they lived in 12. Anyway, it was a

27:26.693 --> 27:28.557
marvelous time. It rained once in a while, but when 
it wasn't, I kind of liked that. It was a little

27:36.974 --> 27:40.602
retreat. I kind of liked the sound of the vehicle, 
and you could hear these commanders giving the

27:41.712 --> 27:46.940
command down the line. I kind of liked that a little 
bit. And for that few brief moments, sophomores

27:48.723 --> 27:52.970
weren't fooling with you. Okay, then you went in 
and ate. Then after supper, what happened? You

27:55.974 --> 27:57.497
went to your room shortly. Not much hiatus there at 
all. And did what? You were supposed to stay. I'm

28:03.085 --> 28:03.506
sure. I said, my desk is asleep. But you were 
supposed to stay. How long? I can't recall. I would

28:11.078 --> 28:21.036
say that lights out were probably, I'm guessing, 
maybe 9.30, 10 perhaps. I don't know. How did you

28:23.301 --> 28:24.142
dress? What did you wear to class and the dining 
hall? We wore a uniform. They'd tell you what the

28:29.753 --> 28:32.678
uniform of the day was, that is to say, You knew, but 
you didn't know about jackets or raincoats or

28:33.485 --> 28:38.130
whatever that announced that. First Sergeant, I 
recall, would announce that. And you wore

28:41.533 --> 28:47.079
uniforms all the time. Period. What kind of head? 
Oh, mercy. What was the finest headgear that

28:52.144 --> 28:54.507
there's ever been? A campaign hat. Except when you 
had on the old blue lapel. Class A ROTC uniform for a

29:01.227 --> 29:09.320
parade or something such as that, and then you wore 
a garrison cap. But the campaign hats were

29:09.340 --> 29:11.984
marvelous. They really were. What about jokes, 
pranks, good bull from any of your years, either

29:16.371 --> 29:25.966
that you knew about or perhaps participated in or 
observed? Can you share any? Oh, they had a lot of

29:28.092 --> 29:30.515
things going. It's hard for me to recall. Probably 
the worst thing that happened, me and three or four

29:36.264 --> 29:44.836
others in my unit, was during the fall, sometime, 
we were placed in the doghouse. And the doghouse

29:45.977 --> 29:53.488
meant strictly, no, you were out of your room for 
one purpose, and that was to go to class. Other than

29:53.508 --> 29:56.392
that, you were in your room at all times. And we had 
to... very much like the Vietnam fellow, we had to

29:58.248 --> 30:05.835
find a way to communicate from the second floor to 
the third floor and that kind of thing. And there

30:06.977 --> 30:20.970
was always this old deal of taking a cow into 
somebody's, into somebody's dormitory room, you

30:06.977 --> 30:20.970
understand, trying to get them upstairs and 
perhaps spend the weekend in there and come back

30:06.977 --> 30:20.970
and find the mess. But let me tell you, there wasn't 
It

30:27.728 --> 30:33.613
took a brave freshman to do very much. But even as an 
upperclassman, did anybody's footlocker ever

30:34.234 --> 30:42.281
get missing? The biggest prank-type deal that I 
can recall, one that I abhorred, was a drowning out

30:42.301 --> 30:54.472
whereby a bucket of water would be tossed into 
somebody's room. It seemed like they wanted to

30:54.492 --> 30:57.094
pick on mine And that meant that I had to clean it up. 
I deplored that activity, but drowning out was a

31:02.686 --> 31:10.753
big deal.

31:10.773 --> 31:13.836
How did life change for a sophomore? It got worse 
for me. Everybody else had it better, but I got

31:16.838 --> 31:21.562
worse.

31:22.403 --> 31:26.727
My sophomore year, we moved from number four
