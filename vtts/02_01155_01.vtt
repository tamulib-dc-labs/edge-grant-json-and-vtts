WEBVTT

00:02.444 --> 00:19.001
But the spinoff from those really

00:02.444 --> 00:19.001
adds to the

00:02.444 --> 00:19.001
people care.

00:19.121 --> 00:19.662
Sure. Back to the profile of the veterinarian, 
skilled, technically skilled, good public

00:19.762 --> 00:30.453
relations, like people, passionate and humane 
toward animals. Anything else? Okay,

00:32.887 --> 01:00.447
let's

00:32.887 --> 01:00.447
talk, if you will, a bit now about the conversion or 
changes in the field of veterinary medicine, say

00:32.887 --> 01:00.447
in the southwest in Texas. moving essentially 
from the large animal uh rural production

01:01.253 --> 01:31.193
orientation to something else and i don't want the 
words in your mouth you just sort of give us an image

01:01.253 --> 01:31.193
of how things have changed of course it follows it 
follows the training of people we were an agrarian

01:01.253 --> 01:31.193
society i grew up in the agrarian society my daddy 
was a little patch farmer you know geeked out a

01:01.253 --> 01:31.193
living turning the soil, and we had animals, and we 
respected the animals. The animals worked for us,

01:36.255 --> 01:41.063
and if we cared for the animals, they'd do the work 
for us. They were important to us, and we had them to

01:43.226 --> 01:46.110
eat. We had hogs, and we killed hogs, and we killed 
calves, and all that, and we ate them. Right over

01:50.617 --> 01:55.445
the farm, we didn't go out and buy the reef or the 
port. That was produced right there on the farm.

01:58.770 --> 01:59.391
And, uh, Animals were very important out there. 
And there was a need for the care of those animals.

02:08.093 --> 02:15.159
The veterinarian's lifestyle then was 
individual animal treatment. Pure and simple.

02:16.240 --> 02:22.846
The old cow got sick and he was called to treat the 
old cow.

02:24.627 --> 02:26.769
The dog wasn't as fortunate. He could go. didn't 
even call the veterinarian for a dog or take him to

02:30.320 --> 02:33.805
the veterinarian either. But the dog was an 
essential utilitarian animal around the place,

02:34.807 --> 02:40.917
but you can get more dogs very fast. And so he wasn't 
as important. Oh, he had his pets, yeah, but mostly

02:45.344 --> 02:49.610
they were utilitarian. They didn't come in the 
house, and we didn't pet them like we do today, but I

02:49.630 --> 02:55.720
had a little dog. that I thought the world of when I 
was a kid, the little squirrel dogs and things. I

03:01.094 --> 03:01.915
found a lot of squirrels. Highly utilitarian. You 
bet. And sheepdogs and all those, you know, that

03:07.021 --> 03:12.026
handle little goats and herd them. But the dog was a 
dog and not a people and they had no rights. But we

03:21.036 --> 03:22.858
treated them nicely. We fed them carefully. and 
gave them a good place to sleep and all that. Tried

03:28.685 --> 03:31.748
to treat them right. And as a kid, we were taught 
that. Well, people began to move to the town. You

03:41.516 --> 03:51.604
know, urbanization took place, and country 
people moved to town, and country people had been

03:41.516 --> 03:51.604
related to animals out there in the country. And 
they got into the town, concrete jungles, and

03:54.948 --> 04:00.735
those animals weren't there, and they missed 
those animals. They longed for those animals. So

04:03.098 --> 04:06.683
they began slowly to take in pets. Now these are 
really pets then, you see. They're not really

04:10.407 --> 04:13.591
utilitarian, but they're pets. They're 
satisfying the emotions of people rather than the

04:13.611 --> 04:19.418
economics of people. So it went from economics to 
emotional. And pets now are emotional

04:23.281 --> 04:30.713
characters.

04:30.733 --> 04:40.990
So the small animal practice then began to come on 
the picture, all for what people want. Now, all the

04:41.010 --> 04:49.845
time and all the way through, it has been bound by 
what people

04:41.010 --> 04:49.845
want. Sometimes in committees and groups that are 
surveying and evaluating the veterinary medical

04:51.935 --> 05:16.299
profession,

04:51.935 --> 05:16.299
it's easy for those in the profession to say, well, 
we did this, we concocted this, we dreamed this up

04:51.935 --> 05:16.299
for the good of the people. And that usually isn't 
the case. It was what the people were telling you to

05:18.781 --> 05:21.604
do is what you did. You are responding to what 
people will inform you. Do you see that through

05:26.509 --> 05:33.656
time as well, that your medicine has been reactive 
rather than... Yes, it's still reactive. Yeah.

05:37.239 --> 05:38.620
Rather than proactive. Even with the public 
health issues, which is something I think we're

05:38.640 --> 05:44.846
going to need to look at. Well, I think even with 
public health, yeah, we're reactive. Does that

05:50.558 --> 05:51.879
bother you? Are you happy with that? No.

05:57.706 --> 06:01.830
And we have committee after committee trying to 
look down the future. But we're not good enough to

06:02.731 --> 06:07.076
see it correctly. And we react to what people then 
demand. And we do what people demand. If you don't

06:14.143 --> 06:15.705
do what people demand, You can go home. And 
veterinary medicine has changed because people

06:20.934 --> 06:29.362
have changed, not what we have done as a 
profession.

06:38.011 --> 06:42.655
Now, when you came in, when you got your DVM, Were 
many people going into small animal practice, in

06:42.955 --> 06:46.901
other words? There were some. There were some. 
There were some. But most of them, even then, were

06:49.805 --> 06:56.294
to give you a little practice. It's a large animal 
practice. And you know, at that point in time and

06:56.915 --> 07:09.553
until this day,

06:56.915 --> 07:09.553
there is the perception out there among

06:56.915 --> 07:09.553
applicants that what we want is a large animal 
practitioner. And they go to the commissions

07:14.909 --> 07:17.753
committee. Well, what are you going to do? What 
kind of practice are you going to do? I'm going to

07:21.437 --> 07:22.459
have a large animal practitioner. Because they 
think that's what we want to hear. That isn't true

07:26.143 --> 07:28.286
anymore. It used to be. And that old image is still 
hanging on there. Right now we're looking for more

07:34.614 --> 07:39.000
researchers than practitioners. Where do they 
go, your research products? What kind of

07:43.776 --> 07:45.420
employment do they go into? They go into 
biomedical research of many different kinds. Is

07:50.349 --> 07:53.475
that where your best market is actually? Yeah. And 
this is where we need the most upgrading. This is

07:58.606 --> 08:00.870
where we get our technology also. is from the 
research side. So it's the research and

08:02.724 --> 08:04.386
development aspect. Yeah. I expect the public 
perception right now, too, is still that a

08:05.287 --> 08:10.233
veterinarian goes into practice. They go out and 
they're either a large animal or a small animal,

08:10.253 --> 08:14.238
but they are in practice. They don't see this side 
of it at all. People come here. We've got six

08:17.822 --> 08:24.790
people, six families coming this morning, or 
today, during the course of the day, to this

08:17.822 --> 08:24.790
office. Prospective students. High school 
students are off this morning. And we're going to

08:29.386 --> 08:34.454
have six of them today, and I don't have any of the 
rest of them. We will have people coming the rest of

08:34.474 --> 08:35.475
the week. These are prospective students. And as 
they come to us, they have the idea that we want

08:37.879 --> 08:46.833
large animal practitioners. And we're looking 
for more researchers than we are large animal

08:46.853 --> 08:52.922
practitioners. We're looking for more large 
animal practitioners than we are small animal

08:52.942 --> 08:56.828
practitioners. Okay, so that still holds, okay. 
We've got a glut of small animal practitioners

09:00.240 --> 09:06.048
located in the cities. How do you know you have a 
glut? Well, when I say a glut, it is that there are

09:08.952 --> 09:18.927
evidence, there is evidence out there that 
there's greater competition. Would you really

09:20.249 --> 09:21.531
get that feedback? You're getting that feedback. 
I would assume so, I just... That's my base there,

09:24.820 --> 09:29.166
and whether it's blood or not. And the employment 
for large animal people is still pretty strong in

09:29.306 --> 09:33.932
the market. Yes. It may even be increasing. We have 
a small distribution. This is like medical

09:39.319 --> 09:40.561
doctors. You can't keep the hospitals open in the 
rural areas. That's right. They're closing those

09:43.465 --> 09:44.807
hospitals. They can't make it.

09:51.035 --> 09:52.617
It's the same way back in the 90s. That's 
interesting. There is, and has been for, I don't

09:54.714 --> 10:03.402
know, 30 years, I guess, 25 years anyway. There's 
been a mild distribution, and it's getting worse.

10:06.605 --> 10:21.760
So I think that's one thing we really want to work on 
in this book we're trying to write, and that is to

10:06.605 --> 10:21.760
try to correctly portray what the profession 
really is, you know, the dimensions, the profile

10:06.605 --> 10:21.760
of a veterinarian, and how they fit into society. 
And I think the public image of that is not what it

10:22.297 --> 10:26.301
necessarily is. I guess if we can correct that 
image, we've done something worthwhile. One of

10:31.485 --> 10:42.215
the concerns, as I've thought about this, that 
I've had, and I don't want to take the discussion

10:31.485 --> 10:42.215
away from you. Over the years, there has been, from 
time to time, depending on the personalities

10:42.235 --> 10:50.042
involved, there's friction between county 
agents, for example. That used to be tough, rough.

10:55.632 --> 11:17.641
As, if this is a true statement, if veterinary 
practice for whatever reasons tends to, or has

10:55.632 --> 11:17.641
tended to congregate in large urban areas, you 
know, the poor folks out in Tulia or wherever are

10:55.632 --> 11:17.641
left with less and less resources to get, you know, 
to answer their animal needs. But the age is still

11:17.661 --> 11:18.983
there. You know why? He doesn't charge them 
anything. That's right. And that's what I'm

11:26.928 --> 11:28.870
wondering. Is that friction... Redeveloping? 
Well, I haven't perceived that it's increasing.

11:38.538 --> 11:40.660
It was bad at one time. It was really, you know, 
dogfights at one time. And then it eased off and it

11:44.603 --> 11:48.767
got better and better and I... perceived that it 
would last several years, that the problem, the

11:49.287 --> 11:56.518
real problem, had really gone away. Now, I'm sure 
there are instances out there where it still

11:56.538 --> 12:01.585
exists.

12:05.471 --> 12:14.183
Of course, the county agent and his staff are out 
there paid by somebody else to help the rural

12:05.471 --> 12:14.183
people. And they do a good job. And it's good that 
they're out there. But they do it for free. Now,

12:25.649 --> 12:37.924
where they went wrong, and I have to blame the 
county agents and their staffs, is they got into

12:25.649 --> 12:37.924
the practice of medicine. If they will stick out 
there to what they have been trained for, there

12:37.944 --> 12:44.252
will be no problem. But when they go over and begin 
to make diagnoses, well, like looking across the

12:45.312 --> 12:53.819
fence, you know, I think that the cows got sold. 
That's a diagnosis to that owner. You're just

12:57.543 --> 13:01.046
thinking that, but that's a diagnosis to that 
owner. That's what that owner perceives. And that

13:02.907 --> 13:07.632
owner operates on that basis and does not call the 
veterinarian. Now, if they could draw the line

13:09.453 --> 13:13.817
well enough to say, Well, you know, I don't know 
what's the matter with that old cow, but I think you

13:15.130 --> 13:21.117
better call the veterinarian and let it sit. 
That'll cement the two together, you see. And they

13:24.080 --> 13:25.282
weren't doing that. Today, they're getting back 
and doing it. Now, if it's widening again, I

13:29.106 --> 13:41.280
haven't... Are they back together, do you think, 
because veterinarians have in fact been

13:29.106 --> 13:41.280
successful in their public relations tasks? That 
not just our farmers... One of the things I, and

13:45.269 --> 13:53.621
this may be my own perception and Aronia's, that's 
why I wanted to ask you, because you might know for

13:45.269 --> 13:53.621
sure. In the early days, you know, the turn of the 
century, the teens and the twenties,

13:54.462 --> 14:09.684
veterinarians were still kind of new kids on the 
block, you know, in terms of the public awareness

13:54.462 --> 14:09.684
of what they did and the function. I don't think 
that's the case anymore. I think people have a very

14:12.792 --> 14:18.299
It may be erroneous, but they have a definite image 
about what a veterinarian is good for and when to

14:12.792 --> 14:18.299
use it. Well, the city and the countryside are a 
little different there. I think what you

14:22.104 --> 14:26.470
described there was the city perception. The 
country knew that there were veterinarians, and

14:26.490 --> 14:30.836
they were out there. But there were no pets, 
essentially, in the city, and there were very few

14:30.856 --> 14:36.804
veterinarians in the city. The veterinarians 
were out in the countryside. That's where his

14:38.627 --> 14:41.230
bread and butter was. And so he was practicing out 
there, and the country people, I think, had no

14:41.935 --> 14:53.889
capacity to see the veterinarian. I'm talking 
about large animal practice. I'm not talking

14:55.050 --> 14:57.052
about dogs and cats, but the countryside. I'm 
talking about cows and horses and sheep and goats

14:57.072 --> 15:01.737
and hogs and domestic animals. And they've had... 
Production care. Yeah. Veterinarians have been

15:05.482 --> 15:11.048
caring for those for a long time, and people have 
used them for a long time. But as the time changed,

15:11.737 --> 15:26.290
why, people in town began to see what 
veterinarians could do. But out there in the

15:26.310 --> 15:40.922
countryside, when the county agent now went to the 
place, and the people called the county agent, he

15:26.310 --> 15:40.922
was probably more known than the veterinarian out 
there. He had more Publicity. The veterinary

15:43.840 --> 15:55.574
medical profession has been

15:43.840 --> 15:55.574
against advertising.

15:59.279 --> 16:00.340
There are some who do. I see a local here recently on 
TV advertising. And the others that are

16:06.648 --> 16:12.034
practicing around this city look down upon him for 
that. Right or wrong, and I'm not arguing the right

16:12.352 --> 16:17.918
or wrong with that at all, but there is a difference 
there. They don't want to. They want to gain their

16:19.980 --> 16:23.804
client by their productivity. And I think that is 
the honest way to go. And I hope they'll stay with

16:30.752 --> 16:32.273
that. Produce and people will come to you. Do it 
right and people will come to you. You don't have to

16:39.481 --> 16:41.143
tell them about yourself. Do it right, and they'll 
come to you. Now, the county agent, though, and the

16:44.760 --> 16:53.749
extension service is throwing out all the time, 
call your county agent, call your county agent,

16:44.760 --> 16:53.749
you see. And the people out there knew, hey, the 
county agent can do this. They're telling me he

16:57.933 --> 17:00.977
can. And the county agent was called out, and then 
he made the diagnosis. And the veterinarian

17:05.582 --> 17:10.827
that's sitting right there in the same little area 
resented that. That's right. And they were

17:13.106 --> 17:16.470
cutting into his practice, you see. Now, the 
Agricultural Extension Service worked hard on

17:16.490 --> 17:24.478
that business, however, and improved it greatly. 
And for the last, oh, 15 years, I would say, I don't

17:25.600 --> 17:36.171
think there's been a big problem out there between 
county agencies. They understand their

17:36.191 --> 17:39.835
positions a little better than they did back then. 
In that same vein, Dr. Price, how has the Texas

17:41.570 --> 17:58.191
Veterinary Medical Association helped, 
hindered, or whatever, the profession in Texas

17:41.570 --> 17:58.191
and the South? Could you sort of talk about the 
relationships between, say, academia, TVMA,

17:58.231 --> 18:04.920
TVNA, and the public? Just how you feel about it as a 
person. Did you join TVMA, for example, right away

18:08.570 --> 18:12.955
when you got here? Is that pretty standard 
procedure that most people join? Why? Most by far,

18:16.419 --> 18:18.100
not all. Why did they join you? What are their 
expectations? Well, you need some kind of a

18:22.565 --> 18:31.835
professional organization, organizational 
structure.

18:31.855 --> 18:37.902
You need, we call it professional and call it 
professional Because we're supposed to

18:38.422 --> 18:43.128
self-impose what we do. We're supposed to clean up 
our own acts. We don't have a

18:47.494 --> 18:55.125
political clout somewhere that's saying, you do 
this. We're going to do it ourselves. That's the

18:58.870 --> 19:02.074
reason we call ourselves professional. We clean 
up our own house. We do our own thing. So in a sense,

19:04.257 --> 19:06.420
it is a regulatory agency. It is an 
intra-professional regulatory agency. In other

19:14.369 --> 19:16.731
words, not from outside, but inside. Regulating 
yourselves. And we need that. And all the way from

19:23.738 --> 19:34.028
the county to the district to the state to the 
American Veterinary Medical Association is the

19:23.738 --> 19:34.028
organization of the chain. And I don't know how 
we'd survive without that, because if we didn't

19:34.666 --> 19:42.517
have that, everybody's going off on his own, just 
doing whatever he wants to do, you know. And I can

19:43.538 --> 19:50.849
perceive that, boy, there'd be clashes, and this 
guy's doing this, and this guy's doing that, and

19:43.538 --> 19:50.849
there'd be no... Which was the major thrust of the 
early association, apparently. We went through

19:54.113 --> 19:58.159
all the records over there in Austin, and boy, they 
were on the... trail of the quacks and I think what

19:58.409 --> 20:01.833
the words they used, but quacks was the big one. 
Quacks, you bet. And even when 1911, when the

20:03.354 --> 20:16.267
Practice Act was passed, and anybody that had been 
practicing five years before that was the

20:03.354 --> 20:16.267
grandfather clause, you know. And they were put in 
the director, though, as NG, non-graduate. to

20:22.810 --> 20:27.475
distinguish them between the graduate and the 
non-graduate. And those that were in there that

20:27.495 --> 20:32.159
five years could keep on practicing. Well, I don't 
know whether any of those are living or not yet. If

20:35.583 --> 20:39.386
not, they're nearly all gone.

20:43.370 --> 20:48.295
What had been the major thrust or efforts of the 
TDMA, do you think? Well, I think it's just that. I

20:50.990 --> 20:52.111
think it's just that. Let's do what we, as a 
profession, we ought to perform as a profession.

20:57.480 --> 21:06.594
Each of us have an obligation to not just 
ourselves, to not just our little area, to not just

20:57.480 --> 21:06.594
our clients. We've got an obligation to our 
profession. Has there been any direct influence

21:10.540 --> 21:17.370
by TVMA, say, on policies of the College of 
Veterinary Medicine? either deliberate or

21:18.380 --> 21:22.145
subconscious or whatever. They

21:22.706 --> 21:26.171
won. 1964.

21:33.382 --> 21:37.928
We decided here at the College of Veterinary 
Medicine to go on a trimester system. We were on the

21:39.991 --> 21:43.136
semester system for four years. And this was 
during the time of sparsity and

21:47.995 --> 22:03.609
it was perceived that we needed to produce more 
veterinarians. And this was a, not just Texas,

22:03.629 --> 22:06.732
this was a national issue. And

22:08.194 --> 22:17.142
to get to that will enhance that. And we studied it 
in the College of Veterinary Medicine carefully

22:23.034 --> 22:38.539
over a period of a couple of years and decided that, 
you know, we could go three trimesters instead of

22:23.034 --> 22:38.539
two semesters. By doing some things, we can do as 
much in a trimester as we can do in a semester. A

22:44.128 --> 22:46.251
semester was a little bit longer than a trimester. 
But we did such things as all examinations were at 7

22:47.176 --> 22:53.064
o'clock in the morning. That gave the whole rest of 
it full day activity. You can do things like that

22:56.969 --> 23:02.937
which put a little more burden on the student. But 
they could move and graduate in three years. We

23:08.985 --> 23:11.749
could better utilize our facilities then. We go 
all the way through the summer. The semester

23:14.046 --> 23:21.414
system, you go nine months and you're off three 
months and come back and this clinic over here and

23:14.046 --> 23:21.414
these buildings sit here for three months. You 
know, what are you doing with them? We utilize that

23:24.197 --> 23:27.180
better. And the cost of the students is only three 
years instead of four years. Maybe the tuition is

23:35.489 --> 23:41.095
about the same is the four-year, but the living 
cost of this. You could graduate and be a

23:45.597 --> 23:48.441
veterinarian with less money. There were a whole 
bunch of good reasons why we did that. Now, back to

23:55.189 --> 23:58.914
your question.

23:59.534 --> 24:07.164
We had to have the sanction of the veterinary 
medical profession to get that job done. We needed

24:07.184 --> 24:09.647
their help to get that job done. Oh, the university 
could have declared that, you know, but that's not

24:10.640 --> 24:15.285
the way to go. We want to go and have everybody 
satisfied. And I'll give you some documents right

24:19.009 --> 24:24.654
here. We went to the Texas Veterinary Medical 
Association and laid out what we wanted to do. We

24:32.062 --> 24:34.645
had no problem. Let's go. Now, today, it's a 
different story today. The economy today is

24:40.390 --> 24:43.032
different. We've put more veterinarians out 
there since that time. And now, out there in the

24:48.097 --> 24:58.587
hinterland, they're a little uncomfortable out 
there about the number of veterinarians out there

24:48.097 --> 24:58.587
today. That was my next question.

25:03.031 --> 25:07.495
I don't think we've got a lot of veterinarians, and 
I don't think we're going to have a lot of

25:03.031 --> 25:07.495
veterinarians. There are people out there who 
believe that we do have, and most of those are the

25:08.217 --> 25:20.789
people who are in the city and where we have a... 
Where they may be in. Yeah, that maldistribution

25:20.809 --> 25:35.362
may be playing a part, and a guy comes in two blocks 
down and sits down and builds a clinic there, it

25:20.809 --> 25:35.362
acts on yours, has influence on your own. So there 
is competition out there. And that is hurting us

25:37.867 --> 25:40.871
right now. It's hurting us from several points. 
Number one is that

25:45.557 --> 25:57.414
high school students out there where that 
veterinarian is practicing and says, we've got a

25:45.557 --> 25:57.414
glut of veterinarians. I can hardly make a living 
out of it. We've been down in economics in Texas.

26:05.364 --> 26:07.367
And as veterinarians, we feel it's economical. 
thing in Texas. We're going to get over it. But

26:11.837 --> 26:13.539
they've been feeling it pretty hard. And you know, 
if you've got a dog, a family pet, and you don't have

26:14.421 --> 26:28.983
much money, and you have to set your priorities, 
you're likely not going to take that pet to the

26:14.421 --> 26:28.983
veterinarian. And so they've suffered through 
this economic period, down economic period. But

26:36.659 --> 26:38.361
as I say, we're going to get over that. But the high 
school kids out there get this impression, well,

26:39.583 --> 26:52.842
if I can't study veterinary medicine, I mean, if I 
can't make a living, I don't want to study

26:39.583 --> 26:52.842
veterinary medicine. And we have dissuaded many 
high school students in our community. Our number

26:58.158 --> 27:02.383
of applicants, applicant pools, is down. Is that 
right? Is that right? Is down. Even without any

27:05.726 --> 27:07.168
real action. That's interesting. And we're 
concerned about it. Well, yeah, because there is,

27:09.931 --> 27:16.939
the word on the street is, vets can't get jobs. 
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I've heard that. Yeah. Yeah.

27:18.721 --> 27:24.047
Another thing that we hear, and this is the 
American Veterinary Medical Association, and it

27:18.721 --> 27:24.047
made a mistake. As it turned out, the American 
Veterinary Medical Association way back there,

27:24.820 --> 27:33.494
oh, I don't know, 1970s, hired R.D. Little, 
Incorporated,

27:33.554 --> 27:46.235
to survey the country and predict what our 
veterinary medical manpower should be in the

27:33.554 --> 27:46.235
future. And they did. And they said, by 1980, 
you're going to have a blood of veterinarians.

27:53.828 --> 27:57.472
Well, when 1980 came and went, we didn't have a lot 
of veterinarians. We have some mild

27:57.492 --> 28:00.796
distribution, but we don't have a lot of 
veterinarians. But that gets around. See, back to

28:03.539 --> 28:05.401
the high school kids again. Mamas and Papas will 
hear that, that you've got a lot of veterinarians,

28:05.441 --> 28:11.267
you can't make a living at it. And shoot, they go 
somewhere else. And we have hurt ourselves, and

28:13.510 --> 28:21.979
the AVMA has hurt the profession with that study. 
That's a good illustration. Conversely now, has

28:26.131 --> 28:43.113
the College of Veterinary Medicine benefited 
from TVMA in using TVMA perhaps as a spokesman for

28:26.131 --> 28:43.113
appropriate legislative appropriations for 
support for funding or anything like that? Well,

28:43.473 --> 28:51.483
let me be honest and candid with you, and I hope you 
won't put this in there. The TVMA...

28:54.865 --> 29:02.033
believes, I really think it believes, it has a 
great influence in the legislature. There's no

29:02.053 --> 29:07.039
way that the TVM agent have a great influence in the 
Texas legislature. There's not enough of us. OK,

29:08.701 --> 29:13.667
certainly Charlie Huff felt that, during his day 
at least. I don't know whether that was true or not,

29:13.687 --> 29:16.751
but I perceive that. Well, I don't know how Charlie 
felt about that. I felt that he did. He may have.

29:25.544 --> 29:33.777
They have worked, the TVMA staff have worked, and 
then we've had other veterinarians that we've

29:25.544 --> 29:33.777
pulled into it, too. And I'm sure they've done 
good. They've done some good. But they're not

29:36.561 --> 29:46.776
going to really bolster sufficiently the 
legislative appropriations for the College of

29:36.561 --> 29:46.776
Veterinary Medicine. They'll go talk to them 
about it. They'll go talk to them about it. And

29:50.422 --> 29:53.006
that's better than nothing. But what I'm saying 
is, They don't have the clout to really pull that

29:55.143 --> 29:59.949
off. So you come through Texas A&M, higher 
education in Texas. That's your force. Oh, we'll

30:07.018 --> 30:09.521
ask them to do that. And one of the main reasons we 
ask them to do that, and here, going off the record,

30:10.262 --> 30:19.052
is to let them know that we perceive that they're 
helping. Well, they're helping. But what I'm

30:21.676 --> 30:22.737
saying is, They're believing they're helping 
more than they really are. But our relationship,

30:27.349 --> 30:30.534
we've got to have a good relationship. I don't want 
to go over there and say or say the two and let them

30:30.654 --> 30:35.883
think that. We think here at the College of 
Veterinary Medicine, they're just dodo's if they

30:35.903 --> 30:40.931
go over there and try to do a thing. They ought to 
stay out of it. That isn't what I'm saying at all. We

30:44.537 --> 30:46.260
need them in there. Yeah, I don't want to make a case 
for that at all, but that helps me understand the

30:46.544 --> 30:57.195
relationship between the association and the 
college. There's another thing about

30:57.215 --> 31:10.429
relationships, too, that is aggravating

30:57.215 --> 31:10.429
between the TDMA and the College of Education, and 
I don't want to build this thing up. No, yeah,

31:10.450 --> 31:11.190
that's not what it's about. We're doing well with 
it. We graduate a student, and he goes out and goes

31:15.890 --> 31:28.209
to work for a veterinarian out there that's been in 
practice

31:15.890 --> 31:28.209
10 years. And he looks to that veterinarian that's 
been in practice 10 years like he is green.

31:36.982 --> 31:40.828
He's unsure, the student, the new graduate. He's 
unsure about things. Well, he should be. And then

31:45.269 --> 31:53.984
the older practitioner out there says, well, why 
aren't you teaching these guys more than this?

31:55.246 --> 32:00.235
Well, he forgets that he didn't have that when he 
got out there ten years ago, either. He was

32:00.335 --> 32:03.140
probably more dumb than that one was. But he 
forgets that, see? And that... They come back to

32:07.915 --> 32:13.861
us, you know, why don't you train them better, you 
know, teach them better. Well, we're teaching

32:14.422 --> 32:16.263
them better every year. It gets better every year. 
It gets more complicated every year. And it's

32:19.687 --> 32:21.769
perception they have. It's not the fact. Are most 
people in the faculty here members of the Texas

32:23.070 --> 32:26.414
TDMA? Most, but many are not.

32:31.839 --> 32:33.961
Are the Texans primarily? I mean, you have vets. 
veterinary medicine researchers here who do not

32:35.253 --> 32:40.519
get to reason with Texans. Oh, yeah, we have a lot of 
faculty. I mean, is there a relationship between

32:41.681 --> 32:53.615
those who are Texans who joined versus those

32:41.681 --> 32:53.615
who

32:41.681 --> 32:53.615
are not? I don't know that there's... I don't know. 
I would guess that the out-of-staters probably

32:54.556 --> 33:01.865
relate to the TVMA better than the men's team. Oh, 
do you? I would guess that. I don't know that's the

33:04.683 --> 33:29.539
case,

33:04.683 --> 33:29.539
but I think the reason the faculty doesn't,

33:04.683 --> 33:29.539
a number of the faculty

33:04.683 --> 33:29.539
members do not join the TVMA is that they see no 
direct

33:04.683 --> 33:29.539
advantage to them personally. Yeah, you don't get 
professional... We have a bunch of them around

33:31.396 --> 33:42.894
here that we call clinical associates that are 
here for three years and

33:31.396 --> 33:42.894
have gone somewhere else. They're really 
graduate students. And they don't see any reason

33:45.719 --> 33:48.944
for joining here, going somewhere else. And you 
have to think about the TVMA mostly is composed of

33:48.964 --> 33:58.399
private clinical practitioners. The examining 
board, Texas Veterinary Medical Examining

33:58.818 --> 34:09.900
Board, by law, every member has to be a private 
clinical practitioner. And private clinical

34:09.920 --> 34:15.210
practitioners are working for private clinical 
practitioners. You go to a TVMA meeting and you'll

34:15.230 --> 34:20.100
have very little about academia. in that TVMA 
meeting. It's the practice, the private clinical

34:22.289 --> 34:26.175
practice of veterinary medicine. So the faculty 
goes and they see these things and they say, well,

34:26.215 --> 34:30.281
where do we come in? They're not doing anything for 
us, you see. Well, they are doing things for us.

34:34.848 --> 34:36.370
They're doing things for the profession. And 
they're vital to the profession, even though it's

34:37.892 --> 34:46.645
not directly maybe helping me here as a teacher in 
the College of Veterinary Medicine. it's helping

34:47.283 --> 34:49.746
me because it's helping my profession. And we have 
the same thing, I guess, in history. So there gets

34:54.012 --> 34:56.395
to be a little bit of, you know. Which raises 
another question. You've mentioned over again,

34:58.018 --> 35:04.306
and I believe you implicitly, that, you know, 
veterinary medicine is reactive. It reacts to

35:04.346 --> 35:05.568
what people want. How does academia find out I 
would think the TVMA, for example, would be a

35:09.237 --> 35:21.572
resource for academia, for example, to go and talk 
to practicing veterinarians and kind of, what's

35:09.237 --> 35:21.572
out there? What's happening? Where's, you 
know... Well, of course, technology. We

35:25.897 --> 35:30.662
established this right here in the clinics. 
That's first. That veterinarian out there

35:32.064 --> 35:33.966
doesn't get that first. We get it here. And then we 
bring him in for a... seminar or the continuing

35:39.275 --> 35:49.104
education program and we show him what this is and 
we train him right there. Now he's probably the

35:49.124 --> 35:59.074
only practitioner out there and they come here on 
weekends to seminars and conferences and we're

35:49.124 --> 35:59.074
teaching people out there all the time. So 
generally they perceive you as a major resource

35:59.094 --> 36:05.400
for their profession and their livelihood and 
everything else. Well, it is. That's more than a

36:08.331 --> 36:09.833
perception. Without the College of Veterinary 
Medicine here, they'd have to be going to Oklahoma

36:11.094 --> 36:16.721
State or somewhere else to get the same thing. 
Well, that's a good thing we can develop in terms of

36:16.741 --> 36:21.588
the relationship. Dr. Bright, I don't want to burn 
you out today. I'm enjoying it. I am, too.

36:31.283 --> 36:36.829
But I guess maybe we'll come back to you time and 
time. But I wonder, would you comment on this again

36:36.849 --> 36:46.240
in very broad terms, perhaps, on some people or 
outstanding accomplishments, outstanding

36:36.849 --> 36:46.240
individuals, major problems. Don't elaborate, 
but sort of point things out to us that you think we

36:46.280 --> 36:55.470
should be aware of, possibly, that you feel that we 
might otherwise overlook. And I don't know what

36:55.570 --> 36:58.033
kind of question that is either. Well, I don't 
either. Well, let me give you a for instance. One of

37:01.940 --> 37:12.531
the things I'm wondering about is horse racing and 
how that's going to impact veterinarians

37:01.940 --> 37:12.531
ethically and practitioner sense and every other 
way. That's obviously a current kind of thing. Oh

37:14.934 --> 37:18.678
yeah, I understand. As a for instance, I mean, 
there's dozens of others. Well, I think the, uh, we

37:22.550 --> 37:33.127
already hear our students talk about equine 
practice more than we did. They picked that up, you

37:33.147 --> 37:35.792
know, that horses, races, takes in some, uh, 
horses are going to need some care. And, uh, they

37:38.035 --> 37:40.539
like horses. Even the little girls that fell in 
love with a horse, you know, that's attractive. I

37:43.985 --> 37:45.908
could be an equine practitioner. I've dealt with 
horses. I've ridden horses, you know, and trained

37:46.997 --> 37:49.820
horses and all that. Hey, that beat is natural for 
me. Yeah, they're talking about that. And I would

37:54.244 --> 38:05.475
expect we will be putting more people out there in 
equine practice.

38:07.317 --> 38:10.581
That's one simple veterinary entire. I can't 
remember what it was. I was saying that veterinary

38:11.482 --> 38:14.865
medicine in Texas really began with the, 
basically equine practice, that people were more

38:15.554 --> 38:21.020
concerned about their horses than anything else 
in the early days. So we might be coming back to

38:21.781 --> 38:23.142
that. Horses are different. Don't forget mules. 
The mules, yeah. They were very important. Well,

38:32.192 --> 38:34.394
that's true. You know, we used to be called horse 
doctors. Yeah, that's right. H-O-S-S, horse

38:38.458 --> 38:39.740
doctors. Horse doctors, yeah. Mr. Ben Green's 
book is that horse doctors. What about some either

38:44.984 --> 38:53.835
interesting, unusual, or exciting people in the 
business, or in the profession here at the

38:44.984 --> 38:53.835
college? Things that are going on that you think 
are most fascinating. To think. Any time. Or that

39:03.246 --> 39:11.576
have occurred.

39:11.596 --> 39:14.299
Like, where you saw that, you know, the history of 
academic veterinary

39:14.988 --> 39:44.826
medicine in Texas has been until more recent 
years, I would say the last 20 years, has been

39:14.988 --> 39:44.826
that we We trained, trained, not educated, 
trained private clinical practitioners, large

39:45.042 --> 40:00.849
animal practitioners, and we had a national 
reputation for doing that. Well, that's what

40:00.869 --> 40:05.557
people were calling for, and that's what we did. 
Well, that's changed, and we've changed. We've

40:09.063 --> 40:10.105
had to change. And that's not what we're looking 
for today. And the people who are really in the

40:14.658 --> 40:29.233
College of Veterinary Medicine making an impact 
on veterinary medicine, other than turning out

40:14.658 --> 40:29.233
veterinarians, is the researchers.

40:29.253 --> 40:33.017
And we're getting better at it, day by day.

40:36.140 --> 40:40.024
And we're doing some things that, you know, On the 
cutting edge of technology, we're getting in deep

40:40.342 --> 40:54.557
into the molecular level of things, the genetic 
engineering side of it. There's a great

40:54.617 --> 41:08.492
opportunity that we can come up with some of the

40:54.617 --> 41:08.492
congenital abnormalities and change that by a 
genetic engine.

41:17.193 --> 41:20.236
And that's the way out there, you know. And we're in 
it today. We've got some good people in it. Now,

41:24.461 --> 41:28.345
does the practice of veterinary medicine do a lot 
with nutrition? Well, not enough. I can see this is

41:32.309 --> 41:35.292
another one of those gray areas. Most of this now is 
really left to the I might say that we've been

41:39.185 --> 41:55.087
a little default. I'm trying to correct it now, but 
we've been a little default of not giving our

41:55.107 --> 42:03.679
graduate veterinarians enough about nutrition. 
They were pretty ignorant in nutrition. Now, you

42:09.307 --> 42:16.796
go out in farmland, I'm talking about, and you say 
what to feed an old cow. If you don't know, well,

42:17.516 --> 42:21.741
you'd look pretty dumb if you're a veterinarian, 
you see. And that needed to be corrected, even

42:21.761 --> 42:30.451
though it lies in the hands of a husbandry. And 
that's where it should be produced, but our

42:30.471 --> 42:36.478
veterinarians need to know that also. and not get 
caught short anyway, you see. Are you getting

42:40.772 --> 42:52.725
people now moving, I guess I'm sure you are, but 
exotic animals, areas,

42:40.772 --> 42:52.725
zoos, etc. Sea world. Yeah. We have a lot of 
students that want to do that. And I know you got a

42:58.432 --> 43:04.238
lot of publicity with your, what's the sea marine 
animal? guy who took care of the whales or

43:05.770 --> 43:11.796
something.

43:15.019 --> 43:26.631
I know that caught a lot of attention, but is that 
part of a real developing area of

43:15.019 --> 43:26.631
veterinary medicine? You're talking about the 
guy who is now at the naval base in California. I

43:38.832 --> 43:41.696
suppose, but he was doing all that work on those. 
Yeah, on whales and stuff. Harpuses and all that.

43:48.206 --> 43:54.335
We have a lot of students that want to go exotic 
animals. And a lot of them mammals. Sea mammals.

43:57.559 --> 44:02.727
Now,

43:57.559 --> 44:02.727
the problem there is that there's not enough 
openings this many times for many of those. Most of

44:10.652 --> 44:16.442
those do not go out there on their own in private 
clinical practice. They go to work for some

44:16.462 --> 44:21.049
organization to do that. And there's just not that 
many jobs out there. Now, I think that we're going

44:24.495 --> 44:29.743
to explore the seas more as years go on, and we're 
going to find that more and more protein out there

44:31.175 --> 44:38.508
in the sea that we need. We're getting all of this 
cholesterol jag and get a little fish in you that's

44:40.230 --> 44:49.326
good for you. And that kind of publicity causes 
people to eat more of the of that kind of thing. Of

44:55.901 --> 44:58.945
sea fish and such like. And we're in the business, 
not here in the College of Veterinary Medicine,

44:58.965 --> 45:14.826
but we're here at Texas A&M in the oyster 
production and the shrimp production and catfish

44:58.965 --> 45:14.826
farming and this sort of thing. I think that's 
going to increase. Now, these animals also have

45:17.229 --> 45:19.632
diseases. And They need the care. And that 
logically falls in the realm of the veterinarian.

45:28.929 --> 45:33.996
So they're going to be more of that, I think.

45:37.420 --> 45:39.463
There's not a whole lot of it today. And there's 
more students wanting to go that direction than

45:39.483 --> 45:45.572
there are opportunities, I'm sure. But you really 
see the trend as you see it right now, in the near

45:45.592 --> 45:51.840
future at least, is research. Maybe genetic 
engineering? Well, let me say the trend. We must,

45:59.676 --> 46:10.088
we must, we are a producer of veterinarians.

46:10.108 --> 46:10.328
Number one. Now, we cannot let the dog, the tail wag 
that dog. I'm concerned a bit with the whole

46:14.813 --> 46:18.958
university. I know what you mean. Yeah, exactly. 
That research thrust. We've gone too fast in that

46:24.313 --> 46:27.677
direction. Now, I think we need to go in that 
direction. And I think the College of Veterinary

46:30.520 --> 46:33.363
Medicine needs to go in that direction. And I think 
we are going in that direction. And we must be

46:35.746 --> 46:48.220
careful not to go too far in that and default on the 
development and production of people who can go

46:35.746 --> 46:48.220
out there and get the job done. But on the other 
hand, we need this to find out how this group can do

46:49.904 --> 46:56.257
it better. That's the flow, from the research lab 
to the animal out there through the practicing

46:56.297 --> 47:05.096
veterinarians. And if we can get that flow.
