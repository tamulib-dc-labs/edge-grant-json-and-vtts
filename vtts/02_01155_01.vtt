WEBVTT

00:02.030 --> 00:13.888
But the spinoff from those really

00:02.030 --> 00:13.888
adds to the

00:02.030 --> 00:13.888
. . . Sure.

00:19.784 --> 00:25.900
Back to the profile of the veterinarian, skilled, 
technically skilled, good public relations,

00:25.880 --> 00:30.900
like people, passionate and humane toward 
animals, anything else? Good business. A good

00:34.000 --> 00:36.899
business man, okay. To survive. Or

00:37.120 --> 00:41.300
a person. A business person, right. I'm going to be 
careful with that, too, in my writing.

00:50.280 --> 00:58.300
Okay, let's talk, if you will, a bit now about the 
conversion or changes in the field of veterinary

00:50.280 --> 00:58.300
medicine, say, in the Southwest in Texas, i.e., 
moving essentially from the large animal rural

00:58.280 --> 01:07.300
production orientation to something else, and I 
don't want to put words in your mouth. Just sort of .

01:11.238 --> 01:11.259
. . Give us an image of how things have changed. Of 
course, it follows the training of people. We were

01:18.880 --> 01:21.900
an agrarian society. I grew up in the agrarian 
society. My daddy

01:25.160 --> 02:15.730
was

01:25.160 --> 02:15.730
a

01:25.160 --> 02:15.730
little

01:25.160 --> 02:15.730
turn-in-the-soil

01:25.160 --> 02:15.730
and pure and

01:25.160 --> 02:15.730
simple. The old cow got

02:15.710 --> 02:37.320
sick

02:15.710 --> 02:37.320
and was an essential utilitarian animal. But you 
can get more dogs. Highly utilitarian.

03:05.717 --> 03:39.340
Those

03:05.717 --> 03:39.340
you know that handle their

03:05.717 --> 03:39.340
goats and

03:05.717 --> 03:39.340
began

03:05.717 --> 03:39.340
to move

03:05.717 --> 03:39.340
to the

03:05.717 --> 03:39.340
cows, began to move to the town,

03:39.320 --> 04:03.120
and they

03:39.320 --> 04:03.120
longed for them. So they began the

04:03.100 --> 04:13.530
utilitarian.

04:13.510 --> 04:16.939
They're satisfying the emotions of people, 
rather than . . . From economics to emotional.

04:30.280 --> 04:32.429
So the small animal . . . All

04:32.490 --> 05:11.600
the way through our

04:32.490 --> 05:11.600
surveying,

04:32.490 --> 05:11.600
we did this. We concocted this. We dreamed this up 
for the good of the people. People

05:15.580 --> 05:21.190
were telling you to do what you . . . You were our 
respondent.

05:26.530 --> 05:29.920
Do you see that through time as well, that 
veterinary medicine has been reactive, even with

05:31.900 --> 05:39.480
the public health issue? Does

05:39.460 --> 05:50.850
that bother

05:39.460 --> 05:50.850
you? Are you happy with that? No.

05:57.747 --> 06:01.420
And we have committee after committee trying to 
look down the future. Not good enough to see it. And

06:05.190 --> 06:13.700
we do what people demand.

06:13.680 --> 06:16.700
If you don't do what people demand, you can go home. 
Veterinary

06:16.680 --> 06:25.850
medicine has changed because people have 
changed. Not what we have done. When

06:28.200 --> 06:40.359
you came . . . When you got your DVM, were many people 
going into small animal practice, in other words?

06:46.580 --> 06:47.601
There were some. There were some. There were some. 
But most of them didn't. And you know, at that point

06:56.820 --> 07:03.460
in time and until this day,

07:03.440 --> 07:21.355
there's the perception out there,

07:03.440 --> 07:21.355
because they think that's

07:03.440 --> 07:21.355
what . . . You want to hear. We want to hear. That 
isn't true anymore. It used to be. And that old

07:29.800 --> 07:34.140
image is still hanging on there. Right now, we're 
looking for more research. We're looking for more

07:35.120 --> 07:39.900
researchers than practitioners. Where do they 
go, your research products? What kind of

07:43.670 --> 07:45.690
employment do they go into? They go into 
biomedical research of many different kinds. Is

07:50.170 --> 07:52.190
that where your best market is actually? Yeah. And 
this is where we need . . .

07:58.130 --> 07:59.067
Here's where . . . This is where we get . . . So it's the 
research and development aspect. Yeah. I expect

08:05.321 --> 08:07.590
the public perception right now, too, is still 
that a veterinarian goes into practice. They go

08:10.570 --> 08:11.507
out and they . . . Sure. They're a small animal, but 
they are in practice. They don't see this side of it

08:13.570 --> 08:14.591
at all. People come here. We've got six people, six 
families come. Okay, so that still holds, okay.

08:18.570 --> 08:19.231
Yeah. We've got a glut of small

08:19.311 --> 08:53.740
animal practitioners

08:19.311 --> 08:53.740
located

08:19.311 --> 08:53.740
in the

08:19.311 --> 08:53.740
city. How do you know you have a glut? Well, when I 
say a glut . . . In other words, you really get that

08:55.720 --> 08:57.720
feedback. You're getting that feedback. Yeah. I 
would assume so. I just . . . Yeah. And you're . . . the

09:03.849 --> 09:04.799
employment for large animal people is . . . Yeah. . . 
. Yeah. . . . Yeah. Yeah.

09:20.730 --> 09:21.281
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

09:28.880 --> 09:30.309
Yeah. Yeah. Yes. It may even be increasing. We have 
a small distribution. This is like medical

09:34.880 --> 09:35.901
doctors. Yeah. You can't keep the hospitals open. 
That's right. There's nobody . . . Closing those

09:40.000 --> 09:41.021
hospitals. That's interesting. There is, and has 
been before. So, I think that's one thing we really

09:43.700 --> 09:53.860
want to work on

09:43.700 --> 09:53.860
in this book we're trying to write, the profile of a 
veterinarian and . . . Yeah. . . .

10:07.520 --> 10:07.969
Yeah. . . . Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. 
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

10:21.770 --> 10:22.791
what it necessarily is. are you gonna get . . . That, 
that used to be tough, rough. . . .

10:53.630 --> 10:55.641
Yeah. As . . .if this is a . . . a utveck med is a 
veterinary practice, for whatever reasons,

11:01.130 --> 11:02.151
tends to hinder a veterinarian. You know

11:02.130 --> 11:10.815
why? He doesn't charge

11:11.115 --> 11:25.603
them anything.

11:25.803 --> 11:26.244
That's right. That's what I'm wondering. Is that 
friction redeveloping?

11:39.391 --> 11:57.981
I'm

11:39.391 --> 11:57.981
sure

11:39.391 --> 11:57.981
there are instances. Of

11:58.062 --> 12:13.170
course, the county agent and his staff are out 
there paid by somebody else to help. Where

12:13.150 --> 13:17.820
they

12:13.150 --> 13:17.820
went wrong is

12:13.150 --> 13:17.820
they got into, if they will stick out there, but

12:13.150 --> 13:17.820
when they go over and that's

12:13.150 --> 13:17.820
a diagnosis to that owner to say, you know, what's

12:13.150 --> 13:17.820
the matter with that old cow?

13:21.860 --> 13:23.669
Cement the two together, you see. And they weren't 
doing that. Today, they're getting back.

13:33.260 --> 13:42.700
Are they back together, do you think, because 
veterinarians have in fact been successful in

13:33.260 --> 13:42.700
their cookbook? That not just our farmers... One 
of the things I,

13:44.680 --> 15:53.340
and this

13:44.680 --> 15:53.340
may

13:44.680 --> 15:53.340
be my own perception

13:44.680 --> 15:53.340
in

13:44.680 --> 15:53.340
a

13:44.680 --> 15:53.340
Romeo

13:44.680 --> 15:53.340
time,

13:44.680 --> 15:53.340
changed was when the

13:44.680 --> 15:53.340
county agent done the veterinarian

13:44.680 --> 15:53.340
out there, he had more publicity of the 
veterinarian against him.

15:53.320 --> 16:00.345
There

15:53.320 --> 16:00.345
are some who do. I see a local here around this city 
look down upon them. Gain their client back.

16:18.300 --> 16:25.345
They're

16:18.300 --> 16:25.345
productive. And I think that is the hope they'll 
stay with them. Produce,

16:31.730 --> 16:41.102
and the people will come too.

16:44.887 --> 16:55.220
And

16:44.887 --> 16:55.220
the people out there knew. Hey, county agent. He 
can do this. They're telling me he can't.

17:02.273 --> 17:05.079
Resented that. Cutting into his practice.

17:14.620 --> 18:06.270
In

17:14.620 --> 18:06.270
that

17:14.620 --> 18:06.270
same

17:14.620 --> 18:06.270
vein, how has the

17:14.620 --> 18:06.270
hinder to whatever, TDMA, TDMA, and

17:14.620 --> 18:06.270
the public, and just how you feel about it? Did you 
join TDMA, for example, right away? Is that pretty

18:11.365 --> 18:14.455
standard procedure? Most people don't know. Why? 
Most don't

18:16.240 --> 18:25.372
know. We're called

18:25.412 --> 18:41.694
professional,

18:25.412 --> 18:41.694
self-imposed.

18:42.635 --> 18:46.460
We're supposed to clean up our own acts. We don't 
have a, we don't have a word that's saying, you do

18:46.440 --> 18:54.699
this. We want to do it ourselves. That's the reason 
we call ourselves. We clean up our own house. So, in

19:03.500 --> 19:06.700
a sense, it is a regulatory agency, would you say? 
It is an intra-professional. In other

19:10.252 --> 19:16.695
words, not from outside, but inside. Regulating 
yourselves. Right. From

19:20.444 --> 19:27.656
the county to the district. We didn't

19:27.876 --> 19:37.653
have that. Everybody's going, just doing 
whatever he wants to do. Which was the major thrust

19:41.960 --> 19:49.424
of the early association apparently. We went 
through all the records over there. Yeah. Through

19:54.641 --> 20:00.917
all the records over there in Austin and, well, 
they were on the trail of the quacks and, I think,

19:54.641 --> 20:00.917
what's the word they used? The quacks were the big 
ones. Quacks. You can bet. Yeah. And your

20:04.989 --> 20:13.720
grandfather

20:04.989 --> 20:13.720
for that. To distinguish

20:13.700 --> 20:26.340
them between the graduate and the non-graduate. 
What had been

20:26.320 --> 20:47.010
the major thrust or efforts of the TDMA? It was just 
that. I think all the performance of profession,

20:54.666 --> 21:06.570
each of us have an obligation to, to not just 
ourselves, to not just our little area. We've got

21:06.550 --> 21:08.570
a, we've got a obligation to our profession. Has 
there been any direct influence of the TDMA, say,

21:08.550 --> 21:20.520
on, on policies of the either deliberate or 
subconscious or? It was perceived

21:20.500 --> 21:43.480
that

21:20.500 --> 21:43.480
we needed to use more veterinarians.

21:43.500 --> 22:05.800
And this

21:43.500 --> 22:05.800
was a,

21:43.500 --> 22:05.800
not

21:43.500 --> 22:05.800
just Texas, this was a national. To

22:05.780 --> 22:37.460
get to that, you got to some things that

22:05.780 --> 22:37.460
studied it in the College of Veterinary Medicine 
carefully and decided that, you know, we could go

22:05.780 --> 22:37.460
instead of two semesters. You can do as much in a 
trimester as we could do in a semester. A semester

22:44.021 --> 22:47.030
was a little bit longer than a trimester. But we did 
such things as all examinations were at seven

22:47.010 --> 22:51.030
o'clock in the morning. Do things

22:51.010 --> 22:58.451
like that. We put a little more burden on them in 
graduating three. We

23:05.290 --> 23:11.380
could better utilize our facilities. What are you 
doing with them? Utilize that better.

23:24.760 --> 23:33.540
The

23:24.760 --> 23:33.540
cost to the students is only three years instead of 
four years. Tuition

23:33.520 --> 23:44.820
is about the cost of this. You could graduate and be 
a veterinarian with less. Right. Less money. You

23:49.270 --> 24:37.360
know, there were a whole bunch

23:49.270 --> 24:37.360
of

23:49.270 --> 24:37.360
them.

24:37.340 --> 24:39.360
Now, today, it's a different story. The economy 
today is we put more veterinarians out there since

24:39.340 --> 24:46.130
that time. It's down

24:46.110 --> 25:41.810
and

24:46.110 --> 25:41.810
sits down and

24:46.110 --> 25:41.810
builds

24:46.110 --> 25:41.810
it.

25:41.790 --> 25:45.460
It's hurting us from several points. Number one is 
that

25:45.440 --> 26:11.720
high school students

25:45.440 --> 26:11.720
out there,

25:45.440 --> 26:11.720
we're going to

25:45.440 --> 26:11.720
get over it. But they've been feeling it pretty 
hard. And you know, if you've got a dog

26:14.490 --> 26:45.220
or two

26:14.490 --> 26:45.220
kids

26:14.490 --> 26:45.220
out there,

26:14.490 --> 26:45.220
get this impression. We have

26:45.200 --> 27:02.340
dissuaded many high school students in our 
African schools. Is that right? Is that right?

27:04.320 --> 27:07.030
Even without any real action. That's 
interesting. And we're concerned about it. Yeah.

27:09.965 --> 27:11.430
Well, yeah. Because there

27:11.410 --> 27:21.510
is.

27:21.490 --> 27:26.860
The American Veterinary Medical Association. 
The American Veterinary Medical Association way

27:26.840 --> 27:32.360
back there in, oh, I don't know, the 1970s hired 
R.D. Little Incorporated

27:33.587 --> 27:39.560
to survey the country. Predict what our 
veterinary

27:39.540 --> 28:01.750
medical manpower

27:39.540 --> 28:01.750
should be. But that gets around. See, back to the 
high school kids again. Mamas and Papas will hear

28:05.730 --> 28:07.750
that. And we have heard her say, hasn't he? That's

28:16.640 --> 28:26.110
a good illustration. Conversely now, has the 
College of Veterinary Medicine benefited in

28:26.090 --> 28:35.060
using TVMA perhaps as a spokesman for appropriate 
legislative appropriations for support for

28:35.040 --> 28:43.060
funding or anything like that? The TVMA,

28:43.040 --> 29:03.190
there's

28:43.040 --> 29:03.190
no way that the

28:43.040 --> 29:03.190
TVMA. Okay.

29:07.926 --> 29:12.180
Certainly Charlie Huff felt that during his day at 
least. I don't know whether that was true or not.

29:13.470 --> 29:14.491
But I can perceive that. Well, I don't know how 
Charlie felt. TVMA staff have worked. But they're

29:16.470 --> 29:17.991
not going to. Your kids. The legislation for the 
College of Veterinary Medicine. For the College

29:27.290 --> 29:36.430
of Veterinary

29:27.290 --> 29:36.430
Medicine. Okay. They'll go talk to them about it. 
That's better than nothing. Yeah. But what I'm

29:44.202 --> 29:46.540
saying is. So, so really. To really pull that off. 
So, so you come through. Absolutely. Texas A&M.

29:57.550 --> 29:58.672
Absolutely. And higher education in Texas. 
That's your. Absolutely. That's your report.

30:02.550 --> 30:03.305
Okay. Oh, we'll ask them. Sure. To do that. Yeah. 
Yeah. Yeah. Well, the main reasons we ask them to.

30:15.720 --> 30:18.740
Is to let them know that we perceive that they're 
helping. But what I'm saying is. They're

30:22.140 --> 30:24.760
believing they're helping more than they really 
are. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. See. But our relationship.

30:31.610 --> 30:32.631
We got to have a relationship. They're just a dodo 
thing. They'll stay out of it. That isn't what I'm

30:41.000 --> 30:42.021
saying at all. No. No.

30:46.460 --> 30:47.065
Sure. Well, that helps me. I didn't want to make a 
case for that at all. But that helps me understand

30:51.150 --> 30:52.171
the relationship. The association. There's 
another thing about the. No. Yeah.

31:07.900 --> 31:37.940
That's

31:07.900 --> 31:37.940
not what.

31:37.920 --> 31:38.941
Well, let's go over to the student. new graduate. 
He's unsure about that.

31:45.437 --> 31:54.180
And then they, there, says, why aren't you 
teaching these guys more than this, see? Well, he

31:54.160 --> 32:00.069
forgets that he didn't have that when he got out 
there ten years ago, either. He was probably more

32:00.371 --> 32:02.240
dumb than that one. But he forgets that, see? Is 
that a little cosplay? Why don't you train them

32:08.920 --> 32:12.670
better, you know? Are most people on the faculty 
here members

32:12.650 --> 32:26.460
of the Texas TDMA? Most, but many are not.

32:31.530 --> 32:33.550
Are the Texans primarily? I mean, you have vets, 
veterinary medicine.

32:41.610 --> 32:44.820
I mean, is there a relationship between those who 
are Texans? I think

32:44.800 --> 33:23.820
the

32:44.800 --> 33:23.820
reason the faculty, that

32:44.800 --> 33:23.820
they see no direct... Yeah,

33:23.800 --> 33:32.090
you don't get professional credits or anything? 
We have a bunch of them around

33:32.070 --> 34:04.590
here that the TDMA mostly is examining the Texas 
Veterinary Medical Examining Board by law. Every

34:04.570 --> 34:06.590
member has to be. Every member has to be a private 
clinic. And private clinical practice, TDMA

34:10.290 --> 34:22.540
meeting, and you'll have very little about a TDMA 
meeting. It's a veterinary medicine. So the

34:26.130 --> 34:30.150
faculty goes and they see these things and they 
say, well, where do we come in? They're not doing

34:30.130 --> 34:33.030
anything for us. Well, they are doing things. 
They're doing things for the profession, even

34:34.800 --> 34:50.740
though it's not direct.

34:50.720 --> 34:52.820
And we have the same thing. Everybody goes through 
that. So there gets to be a little bit of, you

34:53.800 --> 34:56.820
know... Which raises another question.

35:05.700 --> 35:13.120
How does academia...

35:13.100 --> 35:21.870
I think the TDMA, for example, would be a resource 
for academia, for example, to go and talk to

35:13.100 --> 35:21.870
practicing veterinarians about what's out 
there. So generally, they

35:21.850 --> 36:06.420
perceive

35:21.850 --> 36:06.420
you as a major resource for their profession and 
their livelihood. It is.

36:10.095 --> 36:16.480
Without the College of Veterinary Medicine here, 
they'd have to be going to Oklahoma State or

36:10.095 --> 36:16.480
somewhere else to get the same thing. Well, that's 
a good thing. Dr. Price, I don't want to burn you out

36:22.960 --> 36:26.490
today. I'm enjoying it. I am too. We are too.

36:32.510 --> 36:36.530
I guess maybe we'll come back to you in time. But I 
wonder, would you comment on this again in very

36:36.510 --> 36:46.530
broad terms perhaps on some people or outstanding 
accomplishments, outstanding individuals,

36:36.510 --> 36:46.530
major problems. Don't elaborate, but sort of 
point things out to us that you think we should be

36:46.510 --> 36:55.530
aware of possibly that you feel that we might 
otherwise overlook. And I don't know what kind of

36:55.510 --> 36:57.530
question that is either. Well, I don't either. 
Well, let me give you a for instance. One of the

37:01.330 --> 37:03.350
things I'm wondering about is horse fat. And how 
that's going to impact ethically and as a

37:03.330 --> 37:12.460
practitioner. That's obviously a current, as a 
for instance, you know, horse. Yeah. But there's

37:20.306 --> 37:22.940
dozens of others. Well, I think

37:22.920 --> 37:43.670
the little girls that fell in love with horse, you 
know, that's attractive. I could be an equine

37:43.650 --> 37:45.670
practitioner. I've dealt with horses, I've 
ridden horses, you know, and trained horses and

37:45.650 --> 37:49.670
all that. Hey, that would be just natural for me. 
Yeah, they're talking about that now. And I would

37:53.870 --> 37:59.260
expect we would be putting more people out there. 
Equine practice.

38:07.314 --> 38:16.530
That's what some old veterinarian, I can't 
remember who it was now, was saying that

38:07.314 --> 38:16.530
veterinary medicine in Texas really began with 
basically equine practice. That people were more

38:16.510 --> 38:20.530
concerned about their horses than anything else 
in the early days. So we might be coming back to

38:20.510 --> 38:22.530
that. Horses are even different. Don't forget 
mules. And mules. Yeah. They were very important.

38:30.510 --> 38:34.020
Well, that's true. You know, we used to be called 
horse doctors. Yeah. That's right. H-O-S-S.

38:39.000 --> 38:41.020
Horses. Horses doctors. Yeah. Mr. Ben Green's 
book is about horse

38:43.000 --> 38:47.440
doctors. What about some interesting, unusual, 
exciting people in the business or in the

38:47.420 --> 38:54.440
profession here at the college? Things that are 
going on that you think are most fascinating. To

38:58.920 --> 39:01.608
me? Mm-hmm. Anytime. Or that have occurred. I'd

39:04.030 --> 39:11.670
have to think about that. Like where you saw that, 
you know, the new equipment that allows you to

39:11.650 --> 39:22.580
examine without penetration, et cetera. Heart 
medicine, I guess. Well, fortunately, we've got

39:24.800 --> 39:55.440
the history of veterinary medicine, the history 
of academic veterinary

39:24.800 --> 39:55.440
medicine in

39:24.800 --> 39:55.440
Texas is that we train, not educate, train large 
animal practitioners. Yeah. And we had a national

39:56.998 --> 39:59.040
reputation for those. Well, that's what the 
people were calling for. And that's what we did.

40:04.480 --> 40:08.150
Well, that's changed. And we've changed. We've 
had to change.

40:15.180 --> 40:41.930
We were really,

40:15.180 --> 40:41.930
in the College of Veterinary Medicine, making

40:15.180 --> 40:41.930
an impact on, day by day,

40:15.180 --> 40:41.930
some things that on the cutting edge of 
technology. We're getting in the

40:41.910 --> 40:57.390
genetic engineering.

40:57.370 --> 41:07.550
We can come up with some of the

40:57.370 --> 41:07.550
congenital abnormalities. Yeah. And change

41:09.393 --> 41:24.100
that. Now, does the practice of veterinary 
medicine do a lot with... Well,

41:27.080 --> 41:32.060
not enough. I can see this is another one of 
those... Not enough. Prey areas. Most of this now

41:36.040 --> 41:39.470
is really left to animals. Animals, yeah. Yeah. 
You

41:41.450 --> 42:16.840
see

41:41.450 --> 42:16.840
the feed studies on

41:41.450 --> 42:16.840
that

41:41.450 --> 42:16.840
old cow. If you don't know, you're a veterinarian, 
you see. Lies

42:20.960 --> 42:29.440
in the hands of a husband. Yeah. Are you

42:30.923 --> 42:46.780
getting people now moving, and I guess I'm sure you 
are, but, exotic animals? Yeah.

42:49.817 --> 42:53.800
Yeah.

42:53.780 --> 42:54.801
We have a lot of students. I know you got a lot of 
publicity with your... What's the same seed that

42:55.780 --> 42:58.710
took care of the whales or something? Oh, Sam... 
But I know that caught a lot of attention. His

43:01.810 --> 43:07.620
name's

43:01.810 --> 43:07.620
Sam. Oh, fine. Got it. I

43:11.620 --> 43:15.770
suppose, but... The... We... We... We... We...

43:19.750 --> 43:24.740
We... We... We... We... We... We... We... We... 
We...

43:38.600 --> 43:47.300
We... We...

43:47.280 --> 44:18.160
We... We have a lot of students,

43:47.280 --> 44:18.160
organization,

43:47.280 --> 44:18.160
that

43:47.280 --> 44:18.160
many jobs out there.

44:18.140 --> 44:48.040
Explore

44:18.140 --> 44:48.040
the seas more, protein

44:18.140 --> 44:48.040
out there in the sea that are

44:18.140 --> 44:48.040
all jagged and fish in units. It's good publicity 
causes people to go

44:48.020 --> 44:58.880
see in such life and... But you really see the trend 
as you see it right now,

44:58.860 --> 45:52.460
the near future,

44:58.860 --> 45:52.460
at least,

44:58.860 --> 45:52.460
is

44:58.860 --> 45:52.460
research,

45:52.440 --> 46:20.850
maybe genetic engineering,

45:52.440 --> 46:20.850
I

45:52.440 --> 46:20.850
know what you

45:52.440 --> 46:20.850
mean. Yeah. Exactly. That research thrust, 
the... I think we need to go into that because...

46:28.590 --> 46:28.815
OK. who

46:31.090 --> 46:57.070
can go out

46:31.090 --> 46:57.070
there and get the job,

46:31.090 --> 46:57.070
find out how this group can do it better. That's the 
flow, from the research lab to the animal lab. And

47:02.490 --> 47:06.780
if we can get that flow...
