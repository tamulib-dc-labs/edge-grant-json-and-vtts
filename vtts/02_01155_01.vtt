WEBVTT

00:02.512 --> 00:19.034
But the spinoff from those really

00:02.512 --> 00:19.034
adds to the

00:02.512 --> 00:19.034
people care.

00:19.155 --> 00:19.395
Sure. Back to the profile of the veterinarian, 
skilled, technically skilled, good public

00:19.455 --> 00:31.371
relations, like people, passionate and humane 
toward animals, anything else? A good business

00:32.937 --> 00:34.038
man. A good business man. OK. To survive. Or a 
person. A business man. A business person. Right.

00:42.709 --> 00:47.334
I better be careful with that, too, in my writing. A 
business person. OK. Let's talk, if you will, a bit

00:50.078 --> 01:00.430
now about the conversion or changes in the field of 
veterinary medicine, say, in the Southwest, in

00:50.078 --> 01:00.430
Texas. moving, essentially, from the large 
animal rural production orientation to

01:01.287 --> 01:08.217
something else. And I don't want to put words in 
your mouth, but just sort of give us an image of how

01:08.237 --> 01:14.406
things have changed. Of course, it follows the 
trend of people. We were an agrarian society. I

01:23.499 --> 01:25.862
grew up in the agrarian society. My daddy was a 
little patch farmer, geeked out a living. turning

01:31.645 --> 01:36.272
the soil, and we had animals, and we respected the 
animals. The animals worked for us, and if we cared

01:36.292 --> 01:46.127
for the animals, they'd do the work for us, and they 
were important to us, and we had them to eat. We had

01:46.147 --> 01:50.614
hogs, and we killed hogs, and we killed calves, and 
all that, and we ate them. Right over the farm, we

01:50.634 --> 01:54.040
didn't go out and buy the reef or pork. That was 
produced right there on the farm, and... Animals

01:59.759 --> 02:02.081
were very important out there. And there was a need 
for the care of those animals. The veterinarian's

02:08.127 --> 02:15.174
lifestyle then was individual animal treatment. 
Pure and simple. The old cow got sick, and he was

02:16.256 --> 02:24.624
called to treat the old cow.

02:24.644 --> 02:27.607
The dog wasn't as fortunate. He could go. He 
usually didn't. They didn't even call the

02:30.353 --> 02:33.838
veterinarian for a dog or take him to the 
veterinarian either. But the dog was an essential

02:34.820 --> 02:40.969
utilitarian animal around the place, but you can 
get more dogs very fast. And so he wasn't as

02:42.230 --> 02:45.335
important. Oh, we had his pets, yeah, but mostly 
they were utilitarian. They didn't come in the

02:49.661 --> 02:53.627
house and we didn't pet them like we do today.

02:56.780 --> 02:59.845
that I thought the world of when I was a kid. Little 
squirrel dogs and things. I found a lot of

03:02.169 --> 03:04.673
squirrels. Highly utilitarian. You bet. And 
sheepdogs and all those, you know, that handle

03:07.597 --> 03:12.064
little goats and herd them. But the dog was a dog. 
And a lot of people, and they had no rights. But we

03:21.079 --> 03:22.882
treated them nicely. We fed them carefully. care 
of them and gave them a good place to sleep and all

03:24.792 --> 03:28.696
that. Tried to treat them right. And as a kid we were 
taught that. Well, people began to move to the

03:35.422 --> 03:41.608
town. You know, urbanization took place and 
country people moved to town. And country people

03:46.213 --> 03:52.819
had been related to animals out there in the 
country. And they got into town and concrete

03:54.965 --> 03:59.571
jungles, and those animals weren't there, and 
they missed those animals. They longed for those

04:00.773 --> 04:03.096
animals. So they began slowly to take in pets. Now 
these are really pets then, you see. They're not

04:10.426 --> 04:13.290
really utilitarian, but they're pets. They're 
satisfying the emotions of people rather than the

04:13.650 --> 04:19.418
economics of people. So it went from economics to 
emotional. And pets now are emotional

04:23.315 --> 04:30.462
characters.

04:30.482 --> 04:40.993
So the small animal practice then began to come on 
the picture, all for what people wanted. Now, all

04:41.013 --> 04:49.862
the time and all the way through, it has been bound 
by what people

04:41.013 --> 04:49.862
wanted. Sometimes in committees and groups that 
are surveying and evaluating the veterinary

04:51.968 --> 05:16.335
medical profession, it's easy for those in the 
profession to say, well, we did this, we concocted

04:51.968 --> 05:16.335
this, we dreamed this up for the good of the people. 
And that usually isn't the case. It was what the

05:18.798 --> 05:21.621
people were telling you to do is what you did. You 
are responding to what the people will want. Do you

05:26.547 --> 05:33.594
see that through time as well, that your medicine 
has been reactive rather than... Yes, it's still

05:33.614 --> 05:36.797
reactive. Yeah. Rather than proactive. Even with 
the public health issue, which is something I

05:38.699 --> 05:44.605
would like to hear. Yeah. Do I think even in public 
health?

05:48.810 --> 05:48.910
Yeah. We're reactive. Does that bother you? Are 
you happy with that? No.

05:57.661 --> 05:57.721
No. And we have committee after committee trying 
to look down the future. But we're not good enough

06:02.767 --> 06:07.112
to see it correctly. And we react to what people 
then demand. And we do what people demand. If you

06:14.161 --> 06:17.545
don't do what people demand, you can go home. And

06:17.693 --> 06:40.825
veterinary medicine has changed because people 
have changed, not what we have done as a

06:17.693 --> 06:40.825
profession.

06:41.426 --> 06:42.688
When you got your DVL, Were many people going into 
small animal practice, in other words? There were

06:46.955 --> 06:47.776
some. There were some. There were some. But most of 
them, even then, were because it was a large animal

06:49.819 --> 06:56.909
practice. And you know, at that point in time and 
until this day,

06:56.929 --> 07:09.587
there is the perception out there among 
applicants

07:10.394 --> 07:14.920
that what we want is a large number of 
practitioners. And they go to the conditions

07:14.940 --> 07:17.644
committee. Well, what are you going to do? What 
kind of practice are you going to do? I'm going to

07:21.389 --> 07:22.631
have a large number of practitioners. Because 
they think that's what we want to hear. That isn't

07:26.176 --> 07:27.338
true anymore. It used to be. And that old image is 
still hanging on there. Right now we're looking

07:34.648 --> 07:39.034
for more researchers than practitioners. Where 
do they go, your research products, let's say?

07:43.806 --> 07:45.447
What kind of employment do they go into? They go 
into biomedical research of many different

07:45.467 --> 07:50.051
kinds. Is that where your best market is actually? 
Yeah. And this is where we need the most upgrading.

07:58.238 --> 08:02.722
This is where we get our technology also, is from 
the research side. So it's the research and

08:02.742 --> 08:04.483
development aspects. Yeah. I expect the public 
perception right now, too, is still that a

08:05.324 --> 08:08.987
veterinarian goes into practice. They go out and 
they're either a large animal or a small animal,

08:10.261 --> 08:14.246
but they are in practice. They don't see this side 
of it at all. People come here. We've got six

08:17.830 --> 08:24.818
people, six families coming this morning, or 
today, during the course of the day, to this

08:17.830 --> 08:24.818
office. Prospective students. High school 
students are off this week. And we're going to have

08:29.584 --> 08:31.767
six of them today. And I don't have any of the rest of 
them. We'll have people coming the rest of the

08:33.589 --> 08:35.511
week. These are prospective students. And as they 
come to us, they have the idea that we want large

08:37.688 --> 08:46.841
animal practitioners. And we're looking for more 
researchers than we are large animal

08:46.862 --> 08:52.830
practitioners. We're looking for more large 
animal practitioners than we are small animal

08:52.850 --> 08:58.018
practitioners. Okay, so that still holds, okay. 
We've got a glove of small animal practitioners

09:00.301 --> 09:06.210
located in the cities. How do you know you have a 
glut? Well, when I say a glut, it is that there are

09:08.959 --> 09:18.928
evidence, there is evidence out there that 
there's greater competition. Would you really

09:20.249 --> 09:21.531
get that feedback? You're getting that feedback. 
I would assume so. Yeah, that's my base there,

09:24.153 --> 09:29.238
whether it's a glut or not. And the employment for 
large animal people is still pretty strong in the

09:29.358 --> 09:33.562
market. Yes. It may even be increasingly so. We 
have a maldistribution. This is like medical

09:39.314 --> 09:40.636
doctors. You can't keep the hospitals open in the 
rural areas. That's right. Those are in those

09:43.841 --> 09:44.822
hospitals. They can't make it.

09:51.051 --> 09:53.936
It's the same way back in your ministry. That's 
interesting. There is and has been for, I don't

09:54.757 --> 10:05.813
know, 30 years, I guess, 25 years anyway, there's 
been a maldistribution, and it's getting worse.

10:06.586 --> 10:21.768
So I think that's one thing we really want to work on 
in this book we're trying to write, and that is to

10:06.586 --> 10:21.768
try to correctly portray what the profession 
really is, the dimensions, the profile of a

10:06.586 --> 10:21.768
veterinarian, and how they fit into society. And I 
think the public image of that is not what it

10:22.449 --> 10:26.354
necessarily is. And I guess if we can correct that 
image, we've done something worthwhile. Are you

10:31.762 --> 10:34.686
going to get one of the concerns as I've thought 
about this, that I've had. And I don't want to take

10:36.479 --> 10:42.446
the discussion away from you, but it's something 
you want to do. Over the years, there has been, from

10:42.606 --> 10:52.978
time to time, depending on the personalities 
involved, there was some friction between the

10:42.606 --> 10:52.978
kind of agents, for example, the veterinarians. 
That used to be tough, rough. If this is a true

10:57.987 --> 11:17.635
statement, if veterinary practice, for whatever 
reasons, tends to, or has tended to, congregate in

10:57.987 --> 11:17.635
large urban areas, you know, the poor folks out in 
Tulia or wherever are left with less and less

10:57.987 --> 11:17.635
resources to get, you know, to answer their animal 
needs. But the agent's still there. But the what?

11:21.501 --> 11:22.282
The agent. The county agent's still there. Yeah, 
yeah. You know why? He doesn't charge them

11:24.826 --> 11:25.827
anything. That's right. That's right. And that's 
what I'm wondering, is that friction

11:27.552 --> 11:31.676
redeveloping? Well, I haven't perceived that 
it's increasing. It was bad at one time. It was

11:40.686 --> 11:44.450
really, you know, dogfights at one time. And then 
it eased off, and it got better and better, and I

11:44.631 --> 11:53.340
perceived that over the last several years that it 
The real problem had really gone away. Now, I'm

11:56.563 --> 12:05.456
sure there are instances out there where it still

11:56.563 --> 12:05.456
exists. Of course, the county agent and his staff 
are out there paid by somebody else to help the

12:05.476 --> 12:14.188
rural people. And they do a good job. And it's good 
that they're out there. But they do it for free.

12:25.636 --> 12:37.931
Now, where they went wrong, and I have to blame the 
county agents and their staffs, is they got into

12:25.636 --> 12:37.931
the practice of medicine. If they will stick out 
there to what they have been trained for, there

12:37.951 --> 12:45.359
will be no problem. But when they go over and begin 
to make diagnoses and, well, like looking across

12:45.379 --> 12:54.310
the fence, you know, I think that the cows got sold 
and so on. That's a diagnosis to that owner. You're

12:57.543 --> 13:00.647
just thinking that, but that's a diagnosis to that 
owner. That's what that owner perceives. And that

13:02.929 --> 13:09.437
owner operates on that basis and does not call the 
veterinarian. Now, if they could draw the line

13:09.457 --> 13:20.990
well enough to say, well, you know, I don't know 
what's the matter with that old cat, but I think you

13:09.457 --> 13:20.990
better call the veterinarian and let it sin. 
That'll cement the two together, you see. And they

13:23.990 --> 13:25.292
weren't doing that. Today, they're getting back 
and doing it. Now, if it's widening again, I

13:29.118 --> 13:42.758
haven't... Are they back together, do you think, 
because veterinarians have, in fact, been

13:29.118 --> 13:42.758
successful in their public relations staff? That 
not just our farmers... One of the things I, and

13:42.778 --> 13:53.794
this may be my own perception in Aromia, that's why 
I wanted to ask you, because you might know for

13:42.778 --> 13:53.794
sure. In the early days, in the turn of the century, 
the teens and the 20s, veterinarians were still

13:54.382 --> 14:09.690
kind of new kids on the block, you know, in terms of 
the public awareness of what they did and the

13:54.382 --> 14:09.690
function. I don't think that's the case anymore. I 
think people have a very, you know, it may be

14:10.832 --> 14:17.605
erroneous, but they have a definite image about 
what a veterinarian is good for and when to use it.

14:18.226 --> 14:21.170
Well, the city and the countryside are a little 
different there. I think the city, what you

14:21.190 --> 14:26.536
described there, was the city perception. The 
country didn't believe that there were

14:26.556 --> 14:29.821
veterinarians, and they were out there. But there 
were no pets, essentially, in the city, and there

14:29.841 --> 14:36.930
were very few veterinarians in the city. The 
veterinarian was out in the countryside. That's

14:39.052 --> 14:41.395
where his bread and butter was. And so he was 
practicing out there, and he... Country people, I

14:46.036 --> 14:53.645
think, have no capacity to see the veterinarian 
out there. I'm talking about large animal

14:53.665 --> 14:54.486
practice. I'm not talking about dogs and cats, but 
countryside. I'm talking about cows and horses

14:56.609 --> 15:02.415
and sheep and goats and hogs and domestic animals. 
And they've had care for, yeah, veterinarians

15:02.435 --> 15:09.083
have been caring for those for a long time. And 
people have used them for a long time. But...

15:15.652 --> 15:25.507
as the time changed, why people in town began to see 
what veterinarians could do. But out there in the

15:26.328 --> 15:41.009
countryside, when the county agent now went to the 
place, and the people called the county agent, he

15:26.328 --> 15:41.009
was probably more known than the veterinarian out 
there. He had more publicity. You know, the

15:43.593 --> 15:44.815
veterinarian The veterinary medical profession 
has been against

15:45.470 --> 15:56.786
advertising.

15:59.289 --> 16:00.370
There are some who do. I see a local here recently on 
TV advertising. And the others that are

16:06.659 --> 16:13.148
practicing around this city look down upon him for 
that, right or wrong. And I'm not arguing the right

16:13.415 --> 16:15.979
or wrong with that at all. But there is a difference 
there. They want to gain their client by their

16:18.102 --> 16:25.334
productivity. And I think that is the honest way to 
go. And I hope they'll stay with that. Produce, and

16:33.306 --> 16:35.970
people will come to you. Do it right, and people 
will come to you. You don't have to tell them about

16:39.576 --> 16:41.599
your sin. Do it right, and they'll come to you. Now, 
the county agent, though, and the extension

16:44.757 --> 16:53.766
service is throwing out all the time, call your 
county agent, call your county agent, you see. And

16:53.786 --> 16:56.929
the people out there knew, hey, the county agent 
can do this. They're telling me he can. And the

17:00.873 --> 17:05.077
county agent was called out, and then he made the 
diagnosis. And the veterinarian that's sitting

17:05.598 --> 17:10.843
right there in the same little area resented that. 
That's right. And they were cutting into his

17:13.126 --> 17:16.470
practice, you see. Now, the Agricultural 
Extension Service worked hard on that business,

17:16.490 --> 17:24.499
however, and improved it greatly. And for the 
last, oh, 15 years, I'd say, I don't think there's

17:25.640 --> 17:36.192
been a big problem out there between the county 
agents and those managers. They understand their

17:36.212 --> 17:39.936
positions a little better than they did back then. 
In that same vein, Dr. Price, how has the Texas

17:41.570 --> 17:58.194
Veterinary Medical Association

17:41.570 --> 17:58.194
helped, hindered, or whatever, the profession in 
Texas and the South? Could you sort of talk about

17:58.254 --> 18:04.944
the relationships between, say, academia, TVMA, 
TVNA, and the public? Just how you feel about it as a

18:04.984 --> 18:07.307
person. Did you join TVMA, for example, right away 
when you got here? Is that pretty standard

18:12.908 --> 18:15.991
procedure that most people join? Why? Most by far, 
not all. Why do they join? What are their

18:19.215 --> 18:22.658
expectations? Well, you need some kind of a 
professional organization, organizational

18:22.678 --> 18:29.266
structure.

18:31.868 --> 18:37.935
You need, we call it professional and call it 
professional Because we're supposed to

18:38.422 --> 18:43.148
self-impose what we do. We're supposed to clean up 
our own acts. We don't have a political clout

18:47.514 --> 18:54.684
somewhere that's saying, you do this. We're going 
to do it ourselves. That's the reason we call

18:58.890 --> 19:02.134
ourselves professional. We clean up our own 
house. We do our own thing. So in a sense, it is a

19:04.277 --> 19:06.420
regulatory agency. It is an intra-professional 
regulatory agency. In other words, not from

19:12.224 --> 19:16.709
outside, but inside. Regulating yourselves. And 
we need that. And all the way from the county to the

19:23.757 --> 19:34.129
district to the state to the American Veterinary 
Medical Association is the organization of the

19:23.757 --> 19:34.129
chain. And I don't know how we'd survive without 
that, because if we didn't have that, everybody's

19:34.666 --> 19:42.538
going off on his own, just doing whatever he wants 
to do, you know. And I can perceive that, boy,

19:43.560 --> 19:50.871
there'd be clashes, and this guy's doing this, and 
this guy's doing that, and there'd be no... Which

19:50.931 --> 19:54.116
was the major thrust of the early association, 
apparently. We went through all the records over

19:54.136 --> 19:58.142
there in Austin, and, boy, they were on there. 
trail of the quacks, and I think what's the words

19:58.460 --> 20:01.945
they used, but quacks was the big one. Quacks, you 
bet. And even when 1911, when the Practice Act was

20:03.367 --> 20:16.305
passed, and anybody that had been practicing five 
years before that is a grandfather clause, you

20:03.367 --> 20:16.305
know. And they were put in the director, though, as 
NG, non-graduate, to distinguish them between

20:16.906 --> 20:27.100
the graduate and the non-graduate. And those that 
were in there that five years could keep on

20:27.400 --> 20:32.166
practicing. Well, I don't know whether there's 
any of those living or not yet. But if not, they're

20:35.591 --> 20:43.361
nearly all gone.

20:43.401 --> 20:49.388
What had been the major thrust or efforts of the 
TDMA, do you think? Well, I think it's just that. I

20:51.050 --> 20:53.053
think it's just that. Do what we, as a profession, 
we ought to perform as a profession. Each of us have

20:57.494 --> 21:07.350
an obligation to not just ourselves, to not just 
our little area, to not just our clients. We've got

21:07.370 --> 21:10.535
an obligation to our profession. Has there been 
any direct influence by TVMA, say, on policies of

21:10.555 --> 21:18.507
the College of Veterinary Medicine? Either 
deliberate or subconscious or... or whatever

21:21.434 --> 21:27.619
they wanted. In 1964,

21:27.639 --> 21:40.010
we decided here at the College of Veterinary 
Medicine to go on the trimester system. We were on

21:40.030 --> 21:43.133
the semester system for four years. And this was 
during the time of sparsity of veterinary

21:43.153 --> 21:51.340
practitioners.

21:57.209 --> 22:02.095
And it was perceived that we needed to produce more 
veterinarians. And this was not just Texas, this

22:03.616 --> 22:08.202
was a national position. And

22:08.222 --> 22:23.079
to get to that, you've got to do some things that 
will enhance that. And we studied it in the College

22:23.099 --> 22:26.423
of Veterinary Medicine. carefully over a period 
of a couple of years and decided that, you know, we

22:27.230 --> 22:37.967
could go three trimesters instead of two 
semesters. By doing some things, we can do as much

22:39.149 --> 22:43.996
in a trimester as we can do in a semester. A semester 
was a little bit longer than a trimester. But we did

22:47.262 --> 22:52.670
such things as all examinations were at 7 o'clock 
in the morning. That gave the whole rest of it. Full

22:54.922 --> 22:56.924
day activities. You can do things like that which 
put a little more burden on the student. But they

23:02.969 --> 23:07.753
can move and graduate in three years.

23:08.974 --> 23:14.059
We could better utilize our facilities that would 
go all the way through the summer. The semester

23:14.079 --> 23:21.485
system, you go nine months and you're off three 
months and come back in this clinic over here and

23:14.079 --> 23:21.485
these buildings sit here for three months. You 
know, what are you doing with them? We utilize that

23:23.947 --> 23:25.248
better. And the cost of the students is only three 
years instead of four years. Maybe the tuition is

23:35.497 --> 23:45.386
about the same as the four year, but the living cost 
is less. You could graduate and be a veterinarian

23:45.627 --> 23:48.469
with less money. There were a whole bunch of good 
reasons why we did that. Now, back to your

23:55.098 --> 23:58.904
question.

23:59.544 --> 24:07.176
We had to have the sanction of the veterinary 
medical profession to get that job done. We needed

24:07.196 --> 24:10.981
their help to get that job done. Oh, the university 
could have declared that, you know, but that's not

24:11.001 --> 24:15.608
the way to go. We want to go and have everybody 
satisfied. And I'll give you some documents right

24:19.053 --> 24:23.940
here. We went to the Texas Veterinary Medical 
Association and laid out what we wanted to

24:24.477 --> 24:35.170
do. Now, today, it's a different story today, 
though. The economy today is different. We've put

24:43.781 --> 24:48.127
more veterinarians out there since that time. And 
now, out there in the hinterland, They're a little

24:53.806 --> 24:58.671
uncomfortable out there about the number of 
veterinarians out there today. I was going to

24:58.691 --> 24:59.612
explain.

25:03.036 --> 25:08.281
I don't think we've got a lot of veterinarians, and 
I don't think we're going to have a lot of

25:03.036 --> 25:08.281
veterinarians. There are people out there who 
believe that we do have, and most of those are the

25:08.301 --> 25:19.412
people who are in the city and where we have a... 
Where they may be. Yeah, they're...

25:22.578 --> 25:25.561
Maldistribution may be playing a part. And a guy 
comes in two blocks down and sits down and builds a

25:25.581 --> 25:34.708
clinic there, it acts on yours, has influence on 
your own. So there is competition out there. And

25:38.071 --> 25:40.894
that is hurting us right now. It's hurting us from 
several points. Number one is that

25:45.578 --> 25:51.623
high school students out there where that 
veterinarian is practicing and says, we've got a

25:52.328 --> 26:02.156
glut of veterinarians and I can hardly make a 
living out of it. We've been down in economics in

26:02.176 --> 26:04.939
Texas. And as veterinarians feel this economic 
thing in Texas, we're going to get over it. But

26:11.864 --> 26:13.566
they've been feeling it pretty hard. And you know, 
if you've got a dog, a family pet, and you don't have

26:14.447 --> 26:22.133
much money,

26:23.243 --> 26:25.225
You have to set your priorities. You're likely not 
going to take that pet to the veterinarian. And so

26:29.991 --> 26:36.839
they've suffered through this economic period, 
down economic period. But as I say, we're going to

26:36.859 --> 26:38.401
get over that. But the high school kids out there 
get this impression, well, if I can't study

26:39.622 --> 26:53.098
veterinary medicine, I mean, if I can't make a 
living, I don't want to study veterinary

26:39.622 --> 26:53.098
medicine. And we have dissuaded many high school 
students, and our number of applicants is down. Is

27:02.436 --> 27:03.357
that right? Is that right? Is down. Even without 
any real action. That's interesting. And we're

27:07.824 --> 27:09.947
concerned about it. Well, yeah, because there is, 
the word on the street is, vets can't get jobs.

27:14.934 --> 27:15.034
Yeah. Yeah.

27:21.158 --> 27:26.685
The American Veterinary Medical Association 
made a mistake, as it turned out. The American

27:26.705 --> 27:33.514
Veterinary Medical Association, way back there, 
oh, I don't know, 1970s, hired R.D. Little,

27:33.595 --> 27:47.453
Incorporated,

27:33.595 --> 27:47.453
to survey the country and predict what our 
veterinary medical manpower should be in the

27:33.595 --> 27:47.453
future, and they did. And they said, by 1980 you're 
going to have a glut of veterinarians. Well, by

27:53.888 --> 27:55.570
1980 it came and went. We didn't have a glut of 
veterinarians. We have some now distribution,

27:57.532 --> 28:01.656
but we don't have a glut of veterinarians. But that 
gets around. See, back to the high school kids

28:03.558 --> 28:05.400
again. Mamas and papas will hear that, that you've 
got a glut of veterinarians, you can't make a

28:05.460 --> 28:11.907
living at it. And shoot, they go somewhere else. 
And we have hurt ourselves. And the AVMA has hurt

28:14.910 --> 28:17.693
the profession. with that study. That's a good 
illustration. Conversely now, has the College of

28:26.143 --> 28:43.126
Veterinary Medicine benefited from TVMA in using 
TVMA perhaps as a spokesman for appropriate

28:26.143 --> 28:43.126
legislative appropriations, for support for 
funding, or anything like that? Well, let me be

28:43.506 --> 28:48.793
honest and candid with you, and I hope you won't put 
this this in there. The TVMA

28:51.629 --> 29:02.061
believes, I really think it believes it has a great 
influence in the legislature. There's no way that

29:02.081 --> 29:07.027
the TVMA can have a great influence in the Texas 
legislature. There's not enough of us. Okay,

29:08.749 --> 29:13.474
certainly Charlie Huff felt that, during his day 
at least. I don't know whether that was true or not,

29:13.494 --> 29:16.958
but I can perceive that, that he They have worked,

29:19.402 --> 29:33.149
the TVMA staff have worked, and then we've had 
other veterinarians that we've put into it too.

29:33.509 --> 29:40.583
And I'm sure they've done some good, but they're 
not going to really bolster sufficiently

29:41.035 --> 29:46.783
legislation, the legislative appropriations 
for the College of Medicine. They'll go talk to

29:46.803 --> 29:48.165
them about it. They'll go talk to them about it. And 
that's better than nothing. But what I'm saying is

29:53.313 --> 30:00.243
they don't have the clout to really pull that off. 
So you come through Absolutely. Texas A&M, higher

30:02.674 --> 30:06.780
education in Texas, that's your report. Oh, we'll 
ask them to do that. And one of the main reasons we

30:10.285 --> 30:19.058
ask them to do that, and here, going off the record, 
is to let them know that we perceive that they're

30:10.285 --> 30:19.058
helping. Well, they're helping. But what I'm 
saying is they're believing they're helping more

30:21.681 --> 30:27.309
than they really are. But our relationship, we've 
got to have a good relationship. We can't I don't

30:31.576 --> 30:35.882
want to go over there and say or say the two and let 
them think that. We think here at the College of

30:35.902 --> 30:40.768
Elementary Medicine, they're just dodos if they 
go over there and try to do anything. They ought to

30:40.788 --> 30:41.810
stay out of it. That isn't what I'm saying at all. We 
need them in there. They're informed. Yeah, I

30:48.579 --> 30:56.149
don't want to make a case for that at all, but that 
helps me understand the relationship, the

30:48.579 --> 30:56.149
association at the college. There's another 
thing about relationships, too, that is

30:57.175 --> 31:07.428
aggravating

30:57.175 --> 31:07.428
between the GDMA and the College of Veterinary 
Medicine, and I don't want to build this thing up.

31:07.508 --> 31:09.670
No, yeah, that's not what it's about. We're doing 
well with it. We graduate a student, and he goes out

31:15.998 --> 31:24.769
and goes to work for a veterinarian out there 
that's been in practice 10 years. And he looks to

31:26.909 --> 31:33.240
that veterinarian that's been in practice 10 
years like he is green.

31:37.007 --> 31:40.834
He's unsure of the student, the new graduate. He's 
unsure about things. Well, he should be.

31:48.053 --> 31:54.620
older practitioner out there and says, well, why 
aren't you teaching these guys more than this,

31:48.053 --> 31:54.620
see? Well, he forgets that he didn't have that when 
he got out there ten years ago, either. He was

32:00.346 --> 32:03.149
probably more dumb than that one was. But he 
forgets that, see? And that is taking it back to us,

32:05.611 --> 32:10.496
you know. Why don't you train them better, you 
know? Teach them better. Well, we teach them. It

32:15.391 --> 32:16.272
gets better every year. It gets better every year. 
It gets more complicated every year. And it's

32:19.696 --> 32:21.778
perception they have. It's not the fact. Are most 
people on the faculty here members of the Texas

32:23.099 --> 32:26.783
TDMA? Most. Or many are not.

32:31.148 --> 32:31.829
Many are not. Are the Texans primarily? I mean, you 
have veterinary medicine researchers here who do

32:34.011 --> 32:40.358
not get the recent Texans. Oh, yeah. We have a lot of 
faculty. I mean, is there a relationship between?

32:43.471 --> 32:53.623
between those who are Texans who joined versus 
those who are not? I don't know that there's... I

32:54.224 --> 32:54.484
don't know. I would guess that the out-of-staters 
probably relate to the DBMA better than the

32:54.505 --> 33:04.837
out-of-staters. Oh, do you? I would guess that. I 
don't know that's the case, but... I think the

33:10.104 --> 33:12.887
reason the faculty doesn't... a number of the 
faculty members who do not join the TVMA is that

33:15.263 --> 33:29.540
they see no direct

33:15.263 --> 33:29.540
advantage to them personally. Yeah, you don't get 
professional credits or anything? We have a bunch

33:32.523 --> 33:39.151
of them around here that we call clinical 
associates that are here for three years and have

33:32.523 --> 33:39.151
gone somewhere else. They're really graduate 
students, and they don't see any You

33:44.592 --> 33:59.879
have to think about the TVMA mostly is composed of 
private clinical practitioners. The examining

33:59.919 --> 34:09.216
board, Texas Veterinary Medical Examining 
Board, by law, every member has to be a private

33:59.919 --> 34:09.216
clinical practitioner. and private clinical 
practitioners working for private clinical

34:09.803 --> 34:15.208
practitioners. You go to a TVMA meeting and you'll 
have very little about academia in that TVMA

34:15.228 --> 34:22.295
meeting. It's the practice, the private clinical 
practice of veterinary medicine. So the faculty

34:26.259 --> 34:30.303
goes and they see these things and they say, well, 
where do we come in? They're not doing anything for

34:30.923 --> 34:32.625
us, you see. Well, they are doing things for us. 
They're doing things for the profession. And

34:37.799 --> 34:47.430
they're vital to the profession, even though it's 
not directly maybe helping me here as a teacher in

34:37.799 --> 34:47.430
the College of Medical Medicine. It's helping me 
because it's helping my profession. And we have

34:50.553 --> 34:53.396
the same thing, I guess, in history. So there gets 
to be a little bit of, you know. Which leads to

34:56.459 --> 34:57.501
another question. You've mentioned over again, 
and I believe you implicitly, that you know,

35:02.690 --> 35:04.292
veterinary medicine is reactive. It reacts to 
what people want. How does academia find out what

35:05.734 --> 35:13.125
it is that people need and want? Let's do it. I would 
think the TVMA, for example, would be a resource

35:13.466 --> 35:21.598
for academia, for example, to go and talk to 
practicing veterinarians and kind of, what's out

35:13.466 --> 35:21.598
there? What's happening? Where's, you know... 
Well, of course, there's technology. We

35:28.154 --> 35:31.018
establish this right here in the clinics. That's 
first. That veterinarian out there doesn't get

35:32.079 --> 35:34.302
that first. We get it here. And then we bring him in 
for a seminar, a continuing education program,

35:35.644 --> 35:44.956
and we show him what this is. And we train him right 
there. Now he's probably a clinical practitioner

35:48.758 --> 35:58.433
out there, and they come here on weekends to 
seminars and conferences, and we're teaching

35:48.758 --> 35:58.433
people out there all the time. So generally they 
perceive you as a major resource for their

35:59.114 --> 36:06.085
profession and their livelihood and everything 
else. Well, it is. That's more than a perception.

36:11.033 --> 36:16.779
Without the College of Veterinary Medicine here, 
they'd have to be going to Oklahoma State or

36:11.033 --> 36:16.779
somewhere else to get the same thing. Well, that's 
a good thing we can develop in terms of

36:16.799 --> 36:21.223
relationship. Dr. Price, I don't want to burn you 
out today. I'm enjoying it. I am, too.

36:31.393 --> 36:36.858
But I guess maybe we'll come back to you time and 
time. But I wonder... Would you comment, again, in

36:38.050 --> 36:46.258
very broad terms, perhaps, on some people or 
outstanding accomplishments, outstanding

36:38.050 --> 36:46.258
individuals, major problems? Don't elaborate, 
but sort of point things out to us that you think we

36:46.298 --> 36:55.568
should be aware of, possibly, that you feel that we 
might otherwise overlook. And I don't know what

36:55.588 --> 36:59.392
kind of question that is either. Well, let me give 
you a for instance. One of the things I'm wondering

37:02.014 --> 37:03.636
about is horse racing. and how that's going to 
impact veterinarians ethically and

37:04.747 --> 37:12.538
practitioner sense and every other way. That's 
obviously a current kind of thing. As a for

37:18.407 --> 37:21.912
instance, there's dozens of others. Well, I think 
the, uh, we already hear our students talk about

37:22.583 --> 37:29.535
equine practice more than we did. They picked that 
up, you know, that horses, races, takes in some,

37:29.555 --> 37:35.805
uh, horses are going to need some care. And, uh, 
they like horses. Even the little girls that fell

37:40.593 --> 37:43.999
in love with a horse, you know, that's attractive. 
I could be an equine practitioner. I've ridden

37:46.310 --> 37:49.574
horses, you know, and I've trained horses and all 
that. Hey, that beat is natural for me. Yeah,

37:51.376 --> 37:54.119
they're talking about that. And I would expect we 
will be putting more people out there in equine

37:54.259 --> 38:05.532
practice. That's one simple veterinary, I can't 
remember what it was, and I was saying that

38:07.314 --> 38:14.882
veterinary medicine in Texas really began with 
the, basically equine practice, that people were

38:15.588 --> 38:21.053
more concerned about their horses than anything 
else in the early days. So we might be coming back to

38:21.794 --> 38:23.156
that. Horses are even different. Don't forget 
mules. The mules. Yeah, they were very important.

38:32.225 --> 38:32.945
Well, that's true. You know, we used to be called 
horse doctors. Yeah, that's right. H-O-S-S,

38:38.471 --> 38:40.353
horse doctors. Horse doctors, yeah. Mr. Ben 
Green's book is that name, Horse Doctors. What

38:45.018 --> 38:53.869
about some interesting, unusual, or exciting 
people in the business, or in the profession here

38:45.018 --> 38:53.869
at the college? Things that are going on that you 
think are most fascinating. Today? Anytime. Or

39:03.262 --> 39:11.613
that have occurred.

39:11.633 --> 39:14.316
Like, where you saw that new... Equipment that 
allows you to examine without penetration, et

39:15.005 --> 39:22.292
cetera. Heart medicine, I guess. Well, 
fortunately, we've got the history of academic

39:25.154 --> 39:44.792
veterinary medicine in Texas

39:25.154 --> 39:44.792
has been, until more recent years, I would say the

39:25.154 --> 39:44.792
last 20 years, has been that we We trained. Oh, 
trained. Not educated. Trained. Private

39:51.642 --> 39:56.729
clinical practitioners, large animal 
practitioners. And we had a national reputation

39:57.009 --> 40:00.874
for doing that. Well, that's what the people were 
calling for. And that's what we did. Well, that's

40:05.601 --> 40:08.244
changed. And we've changed. We've had to change. 
And that's not what we're looking for today.

40:14.742 --> 40:44.192
people who are really in the college of veterinary 
medicine making an impact on veterinary medicine

40:14.742 --> 40:44.192
other than turning out veterinarians is the 
researchers

40:14.742 --> 40:44.192
and we're getting better at it day by day and we're 
doing some things that you know that's on the

40:14.742 --> 40:44.192
cutting edge of technology we're getting in deep 
into the molecular level of things, the genetic

40:44.543 --> 40:54.575
engineering side of it. There's a great 
opportunity that we can come up with some of the

40:54.635 --> 41:13.977
congenital abnormalities and change that by 
genetic engineering. And that's the way out

41:15.138 --> 41:18.547
there. And we're in it today. We've got some good 
people in it. Now, does the practice of veterinary

41:24.484 --> 41:30.119
medicine do a lot with nutrition? Well, not 
enough. I can see this is another one of those gray

41:32.232 --> 41:35.296
areas. Most of this now is really left to the animal 
husbandry system. You see the feed studies and all

41:41.143 --> 41:49.733
that work, always done by, even the state 
chemistry

41:41.143 --> 41:49.733
stuff. I might say that we've been in a little 
default. I'm trying to correct it now, but we've

41:55.119 --> 42:00.045
been in a little default of not giving the 
hierarchy graduate veterinarians enough about

42:00.464 --> 42:04.590
nutrition. They were pretty ignorant in 
nutrition. Now, you go out in the farmland, I'm

42:09.437 --> 42:16.848
talking about, and you say what to feed an old cow. 
If you don't know, well, you look pretty dumb if

42:17.549 --> 42:21.315
you're a veterinarian, you see. And that needed to 
be corrected, even though it lies in the hands of a

42:21.796 --> 42:29.307
husband And that's where it should be produced, 
but our veterinarians need to know that also and

42:30.333 --> 42:39.963
not get caught short anyway, you see. Are you 
getting people now moving, I guess I'm sure you

42:40.404 --> 42:52.777
are, but exotic animals, areas,

42:40.404 --> 42:52.777
zoos, et cetera. Sea world. Yeah. We have a lot of 
students that want to do that. I know you got a lot of

42:58.261 --> 43:16.045
publicity with your marine animal guy who took 
care of the whales or something.

43:16.105 --> 43:21.332
I know that caught a lot of attention, but is that 
part of a real developing area?

43:24.350 --> 43:26.852
Or veterinary medicine, anything? His name's Sam 
. Yeah. I've got it somewhere. You're talking

43:31.497 --> 43:38.523
about the guy who is now at the naval base in 
California? I suppose, but he was doing all that

43:38.864 --> 43:41.706
work on those. Yeah, on whales and purposes and all 
that. Yeah. We have a lot of students that want to go

43:48.233 --> 43:53.918
exotic animals. And a lot of them mammals, sea 
mammals.

44:00.570 --> 44:05.396
Now, the problem there is that there's not enough 
openings. There's a million times for many of

44:05.416 --> 44:10.662
those. Most of those do not go out there on their own 
in private clinical practice. They go to work for

44:16.490 --> 44:20.274
some organization to do that. And there's just not 
that many jobs out there. Now, I think that we're

44:24.391 --> 44:38.551
going to explore the seas more as years go on, and 
we're going to find that more and more protein out

44:24.391 --> 44:38.551
there in the sea that we need. We're getting all of 
this cholesterol jag and get a little fish in you

44:40.274 --> 44:53.453
that's good for you, and that kind of publicity 
causes people to eat more of the, of sea fish and

44:53.872 --> 45:14.859
such like and we're in the business not here in the 
College of Veterinary Medicine but we're here at

44:53.872 --> 45:14.859
Texas A&M in the oyster production and the shrimp 
production and catfish farming and this sort of

44:53.872 --> 45:14.859
thing. I think that's going to increase. Now these 
animals also have diseases and They need the care.

45:24.579 --> 45:28.343
And that logically falls in the realm of the 
veterinarian. So they're going to be more of that,

45:28.944 --> 45:34.029
I think.

45:37.452 --> 45:39.314
There's not a whole lot of it today. And there's 
more students wanting to go that direction than

45:39.514 --> 45:45.581
there are opportunities, I'm sure. But you really 
see the trend as you see it right now, in the near

45:45.601 --> 45:51.807
future at least, is research. Maybe genetic 
engineering. Well, let me say the trend. We must,

45:59.696 --> 46:09.350
we must, we are a producer of

45:59.696 --> 46:09.350
veterinarians. Number one. Now, we cannot let the 
dog take away that dog. I'm concerned a bit with the

46:14.818 --> 46:19.144
whole university. I know what you mean. Yeah, 
exactly. That research thrust. We've gone too

46:24.392 --> 46:27.777
fast in that direction. Now, I think we need to go in 
that direction. And I think the College of

46:30.541 --> 46:33.385
Veterinary Medicine needs to go in that 
direction. And I think we are going in that

46:33.405 --> 46:35.748
direction. And we must be careful not to go too far 
in that and default on the development and

46:35.768 --> 46:48.186
production of people who can go out there and get 
the job done. But on the other hand, we need this to

46:49.921 --> 46:56.295
find out how this group can do it better. That's the 
flow from the research lab to the animal out there

46:56.315 --> 47:06.276
through the practicing veterinarians.
