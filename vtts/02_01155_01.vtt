WEBVTT

00:02.030 --> 00:13.888
But the spinoff from those really

00:02.030 --> 00:13.888
adds to the

00:02.030 --> 00:13.888
. . . Sure.

00:19.784 --> 00:25.900
Back to the profile of the veterinarian, skilled, 
technically skilled, good public relations,

00:25.880 --> 00:30.900
like people, passionate and humane toward 
animals, anything else? Good business. A good

00:34.000 --> 00:36.899
business man, okay. To survive. Or

00:37.120 --> 00:41.300
a person. A business person, right. I'm going to be 
careful with that, too, in my writing.

00:50.280 --> 00:58.300
Okay, let's talk, if you will, a bit now about the 
conversion or changes in the field of veterinary

00:50.280 --> 00:58.300
medicine, say, in the Southwest in Texas, i.e., 
moving essentially from the large animal rural

00:58.280 --> 01:07.300
production orientation to something else, and I 
don't want to put words in your mouth. Just sort of .

01:11.238 --> 01:11.259
. . Give us an image of how things have changed. Of 
course, it follows the training of people. We were

01:18.880 --> 01:21.900
an agrarian society. I grew up in the agrarian 
society. My daddy

01:25.160 --> 02:15.730
was

01:25.160 --> 02:15.730
a

01:25.160 --> 02:15.730
little

01:25.160 --> 02:15.730
turn-in-the-soil

01:25.160 --> 02:15.730
and pure and

01:25.160 --> 02:15.730
simple. The old cow got

02:15.710 --> 02:37.320
sick

02:15.710 --> 02:37.320
and was an essential utilitarian animal. But you 
can get more dogs. Highly utilitarian.

03:05.717 --> 03:39.340
Those

03:05.717 --> 03:39.340
you know that handle their

03:05.717 --> 03:39.340
goats and

03:05.717 --> 03:39.340
began

03:05.717 --> 03:39.340
to move

03:05.717 --> 03:39.340
to the

03:05.717 --> 03:39.340
cows, began to move to the town,

03:39.320 --> 04:03.120
and they

03:39.320 --> 04:03.120
longed for them. So they began the

04:03.100 --> 04:13.530
utilitarian.

04:13.510 --> 04:16.939
They're satisfying the emotions of people rather 
than . . . From economics to emotional.

04:30.280 --> 04:32.429
So the small animal . . . all

04:32.490 --> 04:59.940
the way through are

04:32.490 --> 04:59.940
surveying.

04:59.920 --> 05:11.600
We did

04:59.920 --> 05:11.600
this. We concocted this. We dreamed this up for the 
good of the people. People

05:15.580 --> 05:21.190
were telling you to do what you . . . You were . . . are 
responding.

05:26.530 --> 05:29.920
Do you see that through time as well, that 
veterinary medicine

05:29.900 --> 05:38.480
has been reactive, even with the public health 
issue? Does

05:40.460 --> 05:51.850
that

05:40.460 --> 05:51.850
bother you? Are you happy with that? No.

05:57.747 --> 06:01.420
And we have committee after committee trying to 
look down the future. Not good enough to see it. And

06:05.190 --> 06:13.700
we do what people demand.

06:13.680 --> 06:17.700
If you don't do what people demand, you can go home. 
Veterinary

06:17.680 --> 06:25.850
medicine has changed because people have 
changed, not what we have done. When

06:28.200 --> 06:40.359
you came . . . When you got your DVM, were many people 
going into small animal practice, in other words?

06:46.580 --> 06:47.601
There were some. There were some. There were some. 
But most of them didn't. And you know, at that point

06:56.820 --> 07:03.460
in time and until this day,

07:03.440 --> 07:21.355
there's the perception out there

07:03.440 --> 07:21.355
because they think that's

07:03.440 --> 07:21.355
what . . . You want to hear. We want to hear. That 
isn't true anymore. It used to be. And that old

07:29.800 --> 07:34.140
image is still hanging on there. Right now, we're 
looking for more research. We're looking for more

07:35.120 --> 07:39.900
researchers than practitioners. Where do they 
go, your research products? What kind of

07:43.670 --> 07:45.690
employment do they go into? They go into 
biomedical research of many different kinds. Is

07:50.170 --> 07:52.190
that where your best market is actually? Yeah. And 
this is where we need . . .

07:58.130 --> 07:59.067
Here's where . . . This is where we get . . . So it's the 
research and development aspect. Yeah. I expect

08:05.321 --> 08:07.590
the public perception right now, too, is still 
that a veterinarian goes into practice. They go

08:10.570 --> 08:11.507
out and they . . . Sure. They're a small animal, but 
they are in practice. They don't see this side of it

08:13.570 --> 08:14.591
at all. People come here. We've got six people, six 
families come. Okay. So that still holds. Okay.

08:21.251 --> 08:54.740
Yeah.

08:55.720 --> 08:57.720
How do you know you have a glut? Well, when I say a 
glut . . . In other words, you really get that

08:58.700 --> 09:00.030
feedback. You're getting that feedback. Yeah. I 
would assume so. I just . . . Yeah. And your . . . the

09:05.855 --> 09:07.277
employment for large animal people is . . . Yeah. . . 
.

09:30.880 --> 09:33.900
large animal people is still pretty strong in the 
market. Yes. It may even be increasing. We have a

09:35.880 --> 09:36.901
small distribution. This is like medical 
doctors. Yeah. You can't keep the hospitals open.

09:40.000 --> 09:40.974
That's right. There's nobody . . . Closing those 
hospitals. That's interesting. There

09:46.350 --> 09:54.860
is and has been before. So I think that's one thing

09:54.840 --> 10:09.540
we really want to work on in this book we're trying 
to write, and that is to try to correctly portray

10:09.520 --> 10:15.540
what the profession really is, you know, the 
dimensions, the profile of a veterinarian, and

10:15.520 --> 10:16.541
how they feel. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And how they 
get into society.

10:26.770 --> 10:27.565
Yeah. That used to be tough. Yeah. Rough. tends to . 
. . You

10:33.780 --> 10:42.250
know what?

10:42.230 --> 10:42.376
. . . Is that . . . Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

10:51.225 --> 10:51.830
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. 
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

11:23.890 --> 11:25.765
Right. Right. Yeah. Yeah. That's right and that's 
. . . Is that what . . . . . . You know what? . . . charge

11:32.884 --> 11:33.301
him anything. That's right. That's what . . .

11:56.970 --> 12:00.215
That's what . . . And that's what I'm wondering. Is

12:01.840 --> 12:06.039
that friction . . . Redeveloping? . . . we have to 
increase . . . . . . and, and . . . . . . I didn't talk

12:11.150 --> 12:12.171
about that. . . . Okay.

12:16.996 --> 12:32.980
Now, I'm sure there

12:16.996 --> 12:32.980
are

12:16.996 --> 12:32.980
instances.

12:33.960 --> 12:45.760
Where they went wrong is they got into, if they will 
stick out there, well when they go over and that's a

12:45.740 --> 12:53.850
diagnosis to that owner enough to say . . .

13:13.850 --> 13:23.620
I don't know what's the matter with that old cow, 
but I cement the two together, you see. And they

13:24.060 --> 13:26.210
weren't doing that. Today, they're getting back.

13:33.280 --> 13:42.580
Are they back together, do you think, because 
veterinarians have in fact been successful in

13:33.280 --> 13:42.580
their cook? That not just our farmers... One of the 
things

13:45.440 --> 15:16.780
I,

13:45.440 --> 15:16.780
and this

13:45.440 --> 15:16.780
may be my own perception

13:45.440 --> 15:16.780
in

13:45.440 --> 15:16.780
a

13:45.440 --> 15:16.780
romantic

13:45.440 --> 15:16.780
way,

15:16.760 --> 15:39.670
time changed was

15:16.760 --> 15:39.670
when the

15:16.760 --> 15:39.670
county agent done the veterinarian out there,

15:39.650 --> 15:53.620
he had more publicity of the veterinarian

15:39.650 --> 15:53.620
against

15:39.650 --> 15:53.620
him.

15:59.260 --> 16:00.361
There are some who do. I see a local here around this 
city look down upon them, gain their

16:00.640 --> 16:22.760
client back. They're productive, and I think that 
is the

16:22.980 --> 16:32.310
hope they'll stay with them. Produce, and people 
will come to.

16:53.740 --> 16:56.960
And the people out there knew, hey, the county 
agent can do this. They're telling me he can't.

17:10.000 --> 17:10.801
Resented that.

17:13.720 --> 17:43.460
Cutting into his practice.

17:43.480 --> 17:46.400
In that same vein, Dr. Briggs, how did... How has 
the hinder to whatever, TVMA, TVMA, and

17:46.480 --> 18:03.850
the public, and just how you feel about it? Did you 
join TVMA, for example, right away? Is that pretty

18:12.460 --> 18:14.360
standard procedure? Most people don't. Why? Most 
of them.

18:34.990 --> 18:41.680
We call professional, self-imposed.

18:41.660 --> 18:46.300
We're

18:41.660 --> 18:46.300
supposed to clean up our own acts. We don't have a 
word that's

18:47.470 --> 18:54.760
saying, you do this. We want to do it ourselves. 
That's the reason we call ourselves. We clean up

19:00.720 --> 19:03.100
our own acts. We clean up our own acts. So, in a 
sense, it is a regulatory agency, would you say? It

19:07.320 --> 19:10.120
is an intra-professional. In other words, not 
from outside, but inside. Regulating yourself.

19:18.916 --> 19:19.041
Right.

19:26.020 --> 19:27.341
From the county to the district.

19:38.660 --> 19:39.242
We didn't have that. Everybody's going, I'm just 
doing whatever he wants to do.

19:50.800 --> 19:53.560
Which was the major thrust of the early 
association. We've been through all the records

19:53.900 --> 19:56.240
over there in Austin. Boy, they were on the trail of 
the quacks. I think that's the words they used. The

20:00.940 --> 20:01.921
quacks were the big ones. Quacks. You can bet. And 
your grandfather.

20:13.780 --> 20:18.465
Before that.

20:18.785 --> 20:43.190
To distinguish

20:18.785 --> 20:43.190
them between the graduate and the non-graduate.

20:43.170 --> 20:46.870
What had been the major thrust or efforts of the 
TVMA? I think it's just that. I think all the

20:50.970 --> 20:56.900
performance of the profession. Each of us have an 
obligation to not just ourselves. To not just our

21:03.550 --> 21:04.971
little area. We've got an obligation to our 
personal. Has there been any direct influence,

21:10.220 --> 21:13.610
TVMA say, on policies of the either deliberate or 
subconscious? It

21:20.940 --> 22:00.280
was

21:20.940 --> 22:00.280
perceived

21:20.940 --> 22:00.280
that

21:20.940 --> 22:00.280
we

21:20.940 --> 22:00.280
needed to. There's more veterinarians. This was 
a, not just Texas, this was a national.

22:16.400 --> 22:24.860
To get to that, you've got to some things that

22:16.400 --> 22:24.860
studied it in the College of Veterinary Medicine 
carefully over and decided that, you know, we

22:27.950 --> 22:38.000
could go, instead of two semesters, we can do as 
much in a trimester as we could do in a semester. A

22:43.950 --> 22:46.250
semester was a little bit longer than a trimester. 
But we did such things as all examinations were at 7

22:47.230 --> 22:51.170
o'clock in the morning. Do things

22:51.330 --> 22:58.060
like that. We put a little more burden on them in 
graduating three.

23:08.880 --> 23:11.320
We could better utilize our facilities. What are 
you

23:11.440 --> 23:23.130
doing

23:11.440 --> 23:23.130
with them? Utilize that better.

23:30.360 --> 23:33.680
The cost of the students is only three years 
instead of four years.

23:38.450 --> 23:45.320
Tuition is about the

23:38.450 --> 23:45.320
cost of this. You could graduate and be a 
veterinarian with less money. You know, there

23:49.410 --> 23:51.150
were a whole bunch of them. Now, today,

23:51.130 --> 24:39.400
it's

23:51.130 --> 24:39.400
a different story. The economy today is we put more 
veterinarians out there. Since that comes

24:45.650 --> 25:41.550
down, it sits

24:45.650 --> 25:41.550
down and

24:45.650 --> 25:41.550
builds

24:45.650 --> 25:41.550
it.

25:41.770 --> 25:43.391
It's hurting us from several points. Number one is 
that

25:43.550 --> 26:10.870
high school students

25:43.550 --> 26:10.870
out there, we're

25:43.550 --> 26:10.870
going to

25:43.550 --> 26:10.870
get over it. But they've been feeling it pretty 
hard. And, you know, you've

26:14.410 --> 26:45.020
got

26:14.410 --> 26:45.020
to tell two kids out there,

26:14.410 --> 26:45.020
get this impression. And

26:45.540 --> 27:02.320
we have dissuaded many high school students in our 
African schools. Is that right? Damn. Is that

27:03.564 --> 27:03.981
right? Even without any real action. That's 
interesting. And we're concerned about it. Yeah.

27:09.964 --> 27:11.430
Well, yeah, because there is. The American

27:11.810 --> 27:22.310
Veterinary Medical Association, the American 
Veterinary Medical Association way back there.

27:29.680 --> 27:30.262
Oh, I don't know. In the 1970s, hired R.D. Little 
Incorporated

27:33.594 --> 27:39.240
to survey the country, predict what our 
veterinary medical manpower should be. But that

27:44.970 --> 28:02.790
gets

27:44.970 --> 28:02.790
around.

28:03.430 --> 28:05.390
See, back to the high school kids again. Mamas and 
papas hear that. And we have hurt ourselves.

28:15.940 --> 28:23.910
And it has hurt preventive medicine. That's a good 
illustration. Conversely now, has the College of

28:26.230 --> 28:32.780
Veterinary Medicine benefited from TVM? In using 
TVMA? Perhaps as a spokesman for appropriate

28:34.640 --> 28:39.460
legislative appropriations, for support for 
funding, or anything like that? The

28:43.200 --> 29:08.680
TVMA,

28:43.200 --> 29:08.680
there's

28:43.200 --> 29:08.680
no way that the TVMA. Okay. Certainly, Charlie 
Huff felt that, during his day at least. I don't

29:13.350 --> 29:16.590
know whether that was true or not, but I can 
perceive that. Well, I don't know how Charlie felt

29:16.570 --> 29:26.770
it. TVMA staff, it worked.

29:36.550 --> 29:45.980
But they're not going

29:36.550 --> 29:45.980
to the legislation for the College of Veterinary 
Medicine. Okay. They'll go talk to them about it.

29:51.820 --> 29:52.781
That's better than nothing. Yeah. So, what I'm 
saying is, to

29:53.342 --> 30:00.050
really pull that off. So, you come through Texas 
A&M, higher education in Texas, that's your

30:00.030 --> 30:06.730
report? Okay. All we'll ask them to do that, the 
main reasons we ask them to do that, is to let them

30:07.532 --> 30:17.380
know that we perceive that they're helping. But 
what I'm saying is, they're believing they're

30:19.220 --> 30:26.920
helping more than they really are, you see? But our 
relationship, we've got to have a relationship. I

30:31.450 --> 30:33.111
don't want to go over there and say ourselves. I 
don't want to say the two of them, they're just a

30:33.090 --> 30:41.840
do-do thing, they'll stay out of it. That isn't 
what I'm saying at all.

30:46.580 --> 30:51.370
Well, that helps me, I don't want to make a case for 
that at all, but that helps me understand the

30:51.350 --> 30:53.930
relationship, the association.

30:57.100 --> 31:07.360
There's another thing about it.

31:07.420 --> 31:08.401
No, yeah, that's not what I'm saying. Well,

31:08.380 --> 31:38.380
it's the student.

31:38.640 --> 31:39.483
Yeah, yeah. The new graduate. Right. He's unsure 
about things.

31:45.620 --> 31:54.320
And then they, there, says, why aren't you 
teaching these guys more than this, see? Yeah.

31:55.207 --> 31:59.520
Well, he forgets that he didn't have that when he 
got out there ten years ago. No, either. He was

32:00.407 --> 32:04.640
probably more dumb than that one, but he forgets 
that, see? Yeah.

32:07.940 --> 32:09.001
He's a little constipated. They come back to us, 
why don't you train them better, you know?

32:22.800 --> 32:26.280
Are most people on the faculty here members of the 
Texas TDMA? Most. Many are not.

32:31.690 --> 32:32.971
Are the Texans primarily? I mean, you have vets, 
veterinary medicine.

32:41.590 --> 32:44.660
I mean, is there a relationship between those who 
are Texans? I think

32:44.640 --> 33:23.400
the

32:44.640 --> 33:23.400
reason the faculty, that

32:44.640 --> 33:23.400
they see no direct,

33:29.290 --> 33:32.110
you know, you don't get professional credits or 
anything like that. We have a bunch of them around

33:32.090 --> 34:01.470
here that the TDMA mostly is examining,

34:01.670 --> 34:04.530
but the Texas Veterinary Medical Examining 
Board, by law, every member has to be a private

34:05.230 --> 34:07.850
clinical. And private clinical, TDMA

34:09.810 --> 34:22.140
meeting, and you'll have very little about a TDMA 
meeting. It's veterinary medicine. So the

34:25.910 --> 34:30.330
faculty goes and they see these things and they 
say, well, where do we come in? They're not doing

34:30.820 --> 34:32.690
anything for us. Well, they are doing things. 
They're doing things for the profession, even

34:33.950 --> 34:50.060
though it's not direct.

34:50.460 --> 34:51.381
And we have the same thing. Everybody goes through 
that. So there gets to be a little bit of, you know.

34:56.420 --> 34:57.401
Which raises another question.

35:05.680 --> 35:17.660
How does academia, I think

35:05.680 --> 35:17.660
the TDMA, for example, would be a resource for 
academia, for example. We go and talk to

35:17.720 --> 35:21.550
practicing veterinarians and talk, what's out 
there? So generally, they

35:21.530 --> 36:04.340
perceive

35:21.530 --> 36:04.340
you as a major resource for their profession and 
their livelihood. It is.

36:10.106 --> 36:13.120
Without the College of Veterinary Medicine here, 
they'd have to be going to Oklahoma State or

36:13.400 --> 36:16.660
somewhere else to get the same thing. Well, that's 
a good thing.

36:23.080 --> 36:25.100
Dr. Price, I don't want to burn you out today. I'm 
enjoying it. I am, too. We are, too.

36:32.390 --> 36:35.290
I guess maybe we'll come back to you. OK. But I 
wonder, would you comment again in very broad

36:36.876 --> 36:43.550
terms, perhaps, on some people or outstanding 
accomplishments, outstanding individuals,

36:43.530 --> 36:50.470
major problems, don't elaborate, but sort of 
point things out to us that you think we should be

36:50.450 --> 36:55.650
aware of, possibly, that you feel that we might 
otherwise overlook? And I don't know what kind of

36:55.630 --> 36:57.650
question that is, either. Well, I don't either. 
Well, let me give you a for instance. One of the

37:01.450 --> 37:09.110
things I'm wondering about is horse racing and how 
that's going to impact ethically and as a

37:09.090 --> 37:19.980
practitioner, that's obviously a current, as a 
for instance,

37:09.090 --> 37:19.980
I mean. Yes. But there's dozens of others. Well, I 
think

37:23.040 --> 37:43.790
the little girls that fell in love with the horse, 
you know, that's attractive. I could be an equine

37:43.770 --> 37:45.790
practitioner. I've dealt with horses. I've 
ridden horses, you know, and trained horses and

37:46.770 --> 37:49.790
all that. Hey, that would be just natural for me. 
Yeah, they're talking about that. And I would

37:53.990 --> 38:05.160
expect we will be putting more people out there in 
equine practice.

38:05.140 --> 38:12.650
That's one simple veterinarian, I can't remember 
who it was that was saying that veterinary

38:12.630 --> 38:17.650
medicine in Texas really began with basically 
equine practice, that people were more concerned

38:17.630 --> 38:20.650
about their horses than anything else in the early 
days. Indeed. And so we might be coming back to

38:21.344 --> 38:22.650
that. Horses are even different. Don't forget 
mules. The mules. Yeah. They were very important.

38:27.630 --> 38:29.201
Tractors, yeah. Well, that's true. You know, we 
used to be called horse doctors. Yeah, that's

38:31.870 --> 38:32.891
right. That's Mr. H-O-S-S. Hoss doctors. Hoss 
doctors. Yeah. Mr. Ben Green's book is that horse

38:36.467 --> 38:38.140
doctors. here at the college? Things that are 
going on in the business. Yeah. You know, I think

38:41.916 --> 38:43.140
that's a good question. I think that's a good 
question. I think that's a good question. I think

38:47.540 --> 38:48.561
that's a good question. I think that's a good 
question. Things that are going on are

39:18.160 --> 39:19.058
fascinating. Do they? Anytime. Or they have 
occurred. I don't think so. penetration, et

39:24.720 --> 39:25.741
cetera. Heart medicine, I guess, is, is. The 
history of veterinary medicine, the history of

39:26.720 --> 39:56.960
academic veterinary

39:26.720 --> 39:56.960
medicine in

39:26.720 --> 39:56.960
Texas is that we trained,

39:26.720 --> 39:56.960
not educated, trained large animal 
practitioners to be successful. And we had a

39:56.940 --> 40:00.921
national reputation for doing it. Well, that's 
what the people were calling for, and that's what

40:00.941 --> 40:04.420
we did. Well, that's changed. And we've changed. 
We've had to change. We're really, in the College

40:12.231 --> 40:33.140
of Veterinary Medicine, making an impact on,

40:12.231 --> 40:33.140
day by day, some

40:33.120 --> 40:57.310
things that,

40:33.120 --> 40:57.310
on the cutting edge of technology, we're getting 
in the genetic

40:33.120 --> 40:57.310
engineering.

40:57.290 --> 41:24.020
We can come up with some of the

40:57.290 --> 41:24.020
congenital abnormalities and change

40:57.290 --> 41:24.020
that. Now, does the practice of veterinary 
medicine do a lot with... Well,

41:27.000 --> 41:31.980
not enough. I can see this is another one of those 
gray areas. Not enough. Most of this, now, is

41:36.187 --> 41:40.390
really left to animal husbandry. You see

41:40.370 --> 42:20.900
the

41:40.370 --> 42:20.900
feed

41:40.370 --> 42:20.900
studies on that old

41:40.370 --> 42:20.900
cow,

41:40.370 --> 42:20.900
and

41:40.370 --> 42:20.900
if you don't know, you prove you're a 
veterinarian. Lies

42:20.880 --> 42:29.360
in the hands of a husband. Are you

42:29.340 --> 42:52.720
getting people now moving, and I guess I'm sure you 
are, but, exotic animals,

42:29.340 --> 42:52.720
etc.

42:52.700 --> 42:53.435
Sea world. Yeah. We have a lot of students. And I 
know you've got a lot of publicity with your...

43:00.610 --> 43:07.540
What's the sea?

43:07.520 --> 43:10.560
It took care of the whales or something. Oh, Sam...

43:15.963 --> 43:17.690
But I know that caught a lot of attention. But is 
that part of a real developing area of

43:17.670 --> 43:25.660
veterinary medicine, do you think? It's his name, 
Sam. You're talking about the guy who is now at the

43:31.240 --> 43:38.540
naval base in... I suppose, but...

43:47.200 --> 43:49.220
We have a lot of students. Organization.

44:01.650 --> 44:28.490
That many

44:01.650 --> 44:28.490
jobs out there.

44:28.470 --> 44:29.491
Explore the seas more. Protein out there in the 
sea. That are all

44:36.160 --> 44:43.610
jagged. Fish in units. It's good publicity. 
Causes

44:48.040 --> 44:58.020
people to

44:48.040 --> 44:58.020
see such life. But you really see the trend as you 
see it right now,

44:58.000 --> 45:51.820
in the near future

44:58.000 --> 45:51.820
at least,

44:58.000 --> 45:51.820
is

44:58.000 --> 45:51.820
research.

45:51.800 --> 45:53.820
Maybe genetic engineering. I know what

45:53.800 --> 46:20.770
you mean.

46:20.750 --> 46:21.117
Yeah. Exactly. That research thrust. I think

46:23.750 --> 46:32.030
we need to go into the College of Veterinary 
Medicine. People

46:32.010 --> 46:47.530
who can go out there and get the job. Find out how 
this group can do it better. That's the flow. From

46:57.970 --> 47:02.430
the research lab to the animal out there. And if we 
can get that flow...
