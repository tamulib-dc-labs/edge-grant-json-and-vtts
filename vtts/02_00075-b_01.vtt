00:02.140 --> 00:05.563
But he's got a place to keep it off campus, so we got out there and put it off campus.

00:06.885 --> 00:21.259
And he came back and was not real thrilled about his locker being gone because, of course, the thing was that the goal was to keep it until the TU game and then take it out on the field, the 50-yard line of the field at halftime, and he'd have to go get it.

00:21.480 --> 00:23.622
Now, how much in advance did you all get it?

00:23.922 --> 00:26.825
We got it about a month ahead of time, which was a big mistake.

00:28.927 --> 00:31.810
You know, we were going to be gutsy and hold out a month.

00:32.498 --> 00:40.211
We ended up sleeping on the springs in our bed.

00:40.231 --> 00:41.533
We couldn't sleep on our mattresses.

00:41.553 --> 00:46.682
We had to sleep on the springs, and we had to sleep in our ponchos, which were those old heavy raincoats.

00:48.044 --> 00:57.139
And to go to the bathroom, we had to wear the ponchos and our helmet liner, and you had to go with a buddy.

00:57.845 --> 01:06.156
And I can remember one day, he got the whole fish class into one room, and we were doing push-ups.

01:07.298 --> 01:11.083
And of course, we got to rest in the up push-up position.

01:11.964 --> 01:16.811
And I can remember, we must have had 35 fish in the room.

01:17.892 --> 01:23.880
And it was so hot in the room that moisture was raining down the walls.

01:25.042 --> 01:27.565
And Zesky was standing on the desk in the corner.

01:28.490 --> 01:37.481
and convinced us, and that could get together, that we probably ought to give him his foot locker back.

01:37.602 --> 01:37.942
Did you?

01:38.182 --> 01:38.503
We did.

01:38.843 --> 01:39.244
We did.

01:39.304 --> 01:41.567
Where did you all have it hidden?

01:41.587 --> 01:42.067
I can't remember.

01:42.127 --> 01:46.092
One of the guys had it hidden, had a friend off campus or something, and we had it off campus.

01:47.674 --> 01:49.837
That's a good one.

01:50.198 --> 01:52.941
We were going to be gutsy and hold out a month, and we didn't.

01:55.084 --> 01:55.965
Any other?

01:55.945 --> 01:57.367
No, I don't have anything else.

01:57.527 --> 01:59.069
I can't think of anything else at the moment.

01:59.089 --> 02:00.992
I'll probably think of a thousand things after you're gone.

02:01.012 --> 02:01.252
All right.

02:01.272 --> 02:06.099
Then the last one is, what feelings do you carry in your heart for Texas A&M?

02:06.600 --> 02:13.069
Oh, it's... I get emotional about A&M.

02:13.089 --> 02:18.296
You know, kind of like when we were just talking about that story about Luster when Morley Johnson answered for her father.

02:20.419 --> 02:23.083
To me, A&M is right next to my faith.

02:23.890 --> 02:25.592
and the importance in my life.

02:26.253 --> 02:28.696
And we raised our kids that way.

02:29.958 --> 02:45.618
We took them, I mean, from the time my kids were six, seven, eight years old, we took them to A&M and injected them, I mean, injected maroon fluid into their blood and everything else, both my wife and I. I think it was more important to us that they go to A&M than anything else.

02:45.638 --> 02:49.062
And both kids from that only applied one place.

02:50.504 --> 02:53.087
And both went to A&M, both in the Corps and Squadron 17.

02:53.978 --> 03:00.588
And both of them, my oldest son, well, both of my sons thanked me, thank us for that.

03:00.948 --> 03:14.589
But it's a major cornerstone in my life.

03:15.390 --> 03:22.821
And in actuality, my wife and I, when we finally retired, would like to move back to College Station.

03:24.033 --> 03:26.277
because we know we'd never have to worry about visitors.

03:26.517 --> 03:28.761
I mean, people would be coming all the time to visit us.

03:29.462 --> 03:34.230
But that's one of the things that when I'm recruiting and talking to parents, I try to get across to them.

03:34.291 --> 03:38.398
And of course, again, it's one of those things that you've got to be there to understand it.

03:40.581 --> 03:46.291
But the camaraderie, again, that's the thing that, you know, I talk about the service academies down in military schools.

03:46.331 --> 03:48.555
It's something that they don't have.

03:48.670 --> 03:50.552
They don't have that love of school.

03:50.572 --> 03:52.835
When you talk to West Point grads, they don't have it.

03:53.556 --> 03:58.622
They talk about class standing and rank and all this other stuff, but they don't have the love of their school.

03:58.642 --> 04:00.464
The Air Force Academy absolutely does not.

04:01.285 --> 04:03.027
The Air Force Academy has changed significantly.

04:03.048 --> 04:07.793
They're kind of in the business of producing nerds, techies and that sort of stuff.

04:07.833 --> 04:10.016
Leadership is not a big deal.

04:10.056 --> 04:15.403
I have not been overly impressed in my military career with Air Force Academy graduates.

04:15.583 --> 04:17.445
They don't have the

04:18.590 --> 04:23.702
they don't have the loyalty to their fellow graduates that Aggies have to theirs.

04:24.984 --> 04:37.172
I mean, my biggest problem with Air Force Academy graduates is when I went to pilot training during Vietnam, of course the Academy always gets the cream of the crop on pilot assignments, I mean on pilot training assignments and that sort of stuff.

04:38.840 --> 04:47.356
When I got there, there were about six or seven academy grad SIE, self-initiated elimination.

04:47.376 --> 04:52.246
They'd gone to the academy, got their free degree, went to pilot training, and said, I'm not going to do this, and bam, they were gone.

04:54.650 --> 04:58.097
So I've not been overly impressed with the Air Force Academy.

04:59.326 --> 05:06.357
And I've talked to some of the folks at A&M who have done exchange visits, some of the people in the Trigon who've done exchange visits with the academy and talked to people up there.

05:06.378 --> 05:11.726
And they don't have the same sense of mission about building leaders that A&M does.

05:14.811 --> 05:16.053
But anyway, that's just a satellite.

05:18.237 --> 05:18.437
All right.

05:18.457 --> 05:20.360
Unless you have anything else to add real quick.

05:20.380 --> 05:21.402
I can't think of anything.
