WEBVTT

00:03.288 --> 00:20.035
Libya, Egypt, Lebanon, Iraq, Iran, Pakistan, India.

00:20.056 --> 00:28.890
I guess I was there for about three and a half months looking at all of the problems.

00:29.798 --> 00:32.962
Then I came back to Rome and I wrote the report.

00:32.982 --> 00:56.513
It so happened that at that time Frank Parker, who was at that time was FAO, he was one of the real good old line agronomists, a tremendous man, originally with the U.S.

00:56.533 --> 00:57.915
Department of Agriculture.

00:59.093 --> 01:12.133
or even prior to that he was with the DuPont Chemical Company, rather briefly, then with the USDA.

01:12.153 --> 01:21.908
And then he was with FAO, and he had a sort of a world conference on fertilizer and the needs for fertilizer in the third world.

01:21.948 --> 01:28.037
So when I was writing this report, there was a couple day conference

01:28.169 --> 01:33.996
And he invited me to talk to the whole gathering, which I did.

01:34.697 --> 01:39.843
And I put a lot of emphasis on, we aren't going anyplace until we do something about soil fertility.

01:40.484 --> 01:47.172
That he said it had to be soil fertility, but we had to have the varieties with disease resistance, we had to put the whole package together.

01:49.095 --> 01:55.122
I turned in that report, which also, I put strong emphasis on this.

01:55.574 --> 02:13.119
We will never be able to change the production of basic food crops in any measurable way in all of these countries until we train a lot of young scientists.

02:13.459 --> 02:25.176
I pointed out that there were only two countries that had any appreciable number of well-trained people, and that was Egypt and India.

02:26.236 --> 02:48.125
but that most of these people were involved in doing a continuation of their PhD dissertation or research program done at some European university, sometimes an American, but generally European, and that had no relevance whatsoever to the jobs that needed to be done.

02:49.226 --> 02:50.248
To the local conditions.

02:50.308 --> 02:51.469
To the local conditions.

02:51.489 --> 02:54.353
We talked a little bit about this last time.

02:55.008 --> 03:20.541
I suggested we bring that FAO through Abdul Hafiz, who was their regional representative based in Cairo, identify the best young people in all of those countries and that the Rockefeller Foundation put up monies to support the practical hands-on training and that they be sent to Mexico.

03:20.621 --> 03:23.665
And when I was working as a consultant there,

03:24.050 --> 03:30.096
also start training them because I still continued to work with the Mexican program.

03:30.156 --> 03:40.345
I mean I was kind of like the old uncle and so I had no problems in working effectively with the Mexican team which I had trained.

03:42.047 --> 03:50.234
And this became, in 61, this started to roll.

03:51.135 --> 03:53.297
Originally we kept them for a year.

03:53.530 --> 04:01.101
But then it was cut back, because there was a growing number of demands, cut back to six months.

04:01.442 --> 04:02.848
We couldn't take care of them.

04:03.740 --> 04:12.549
And that remains, I think, one of the most important vehicles we've had for preparing people, not just in plant breeding or plant pathology.

04:12.569 --> 04:14.671
We tried to give them a feel for the whole thing.

04:16.233 --> 04:17.754
They worked on the stations with me.

04:18.215 --> 04:21.938
I had to do, in the early time, you see, there was no cement at that time.

04:21.998 --> 04:23.380
It was an in-between thing.

04:24.141 --> 04:33.510
I was paid out of the Rockefeller Foundation Fund that was called the program Inter-American Agricultural Research Program.

04:33.878 --> 04:35.120
It didn't have any structure.

04:35.260 --> 04:43.714
Wellhausen and I, and there were four or five of us who were left in this transfer responsibility based in Mexico.

04:45.277 --> 04:50.405
Wellhausen was our corn breeder, Niederhauser our potato man.

04:50.926 --> 04:51.667
There were about five.

04:53.730 --> 04:58.418
And so during this period I got a good feel for

04:59.562 --> 05:27.848
Previous to the closing of the Mexican program, we had established what we called an inter-American uniform wheat nursery, which was made up of the main wheat varieties, commercial ones, from Canada, the spring wheat regions of the U.S., Mexico, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Chile, Argentina, and Brazil.

05:28.165 --> 05:31.811
And we had grown these for several years.

05:32.592 --> 05:42.227
And it was there that we could see that these Mexican varieties that we had developed by the shuttle breeding were very broadly adapted.

05:43.670 --> 05:54.527
Whereas the Canadian and the U.S., once you moved them beyond about 40 degrees, they couldn't function.

05:54.625 --> 06:02.292
This explained also, of course, why we could never use them in any of the countries like Mexico or near the equator.

06:02.853 --> 06:12.662
And why they didn't fit also many parts of India or Pakistan or Egypt or all of those areas, despite the fact that they had excellent disease resistance, good milling and baking quality.

06:14.163 --> 06:24.092
But when these young people came, and we used to have informal seminars, and I'd work with them mostly in the field, right out in the plots.

06:24.730 --> 06:27.654
and on farmer's fields.

06:29.897 --> 06:49.084
It was not a formal training course at all, but when they saw these data, and they actually participated in growing these seeds for the next year's nurseries, putting the nursery together, making up the seed packages and randomizing the plots and shipping them, and

06:49.452 --> 06:52.315
analyzing the data that had come back from the year before.

06:52.375 --> 07:06.110
And they got all interested in this and they said, well, why can't we see from this that none of those things from Canada, the U.S., from Argentina will fit our situations, whereas yours will.

07:06.850 --> 07:09.513
Why can't we forget about those?

07:10.815 --> 07:16.000
And we established one, we'll call it Mexican Near Middle East,

07:16.300 --> 07:19.964
I said, all right, if you want to do that, get a few seeds and we'll multiply them.

07:20.545 --> 07:27.773
And so this became where we could actually see the adaptation across these countries.

07:27.794 --> 07:30.717
Then after about two years of this, then we combined the two.

07:30.757 --> 07:34.742
That's been running now for about 20 years.

07:35.082 --> 07:40.148
So this has given us massive amounts, this International Spring Wheat Yield Nursery.

07:40.668 --> 07:44.013
So this has been running out of Mexico ever since the early 1960s.

07:44.094 --> 07:45.456
Yeah.

07:45.636 --> 07:56.173
Cimet took it over when it came to be in about 19... Cimet came to be in 64 on paper, but it was really close to 68 before we got structured.

07:57.515 --> 08:07.992
But it's become the Bible or the Koran for the plant breeders who want to use it intelligently to look ahead because these varieties,

08:09.203 --> 08:38.502
are not only the commercial varieties we've modified it there are 25 of the well most important commercial varieties of spring wheat and we include canadian u.s because they're points of reference even though they don't fit in in low latitude still for certain parts of the world this is important where they fit and also it gives us a lot of insight into parental material that we'll use in

08:39.140 --> 08:40.602
crossing and recombination.

08:41.323 --> 08:49.454
So this has been going on now in this international vein for more than 20 years.

08:50.415 --> 08:55.722
And about how many scientists did you bring in the early 60s and about how many today?

08:56.122 --> 08:56.843
Okay.

08:56.863 --> 08:59.647
In the early 60s, I was the training officer.

08:59.767 --> 09:00.248
I was it.

09:01.029 --> 09:05.435
And I had decided that with my other responsibilities I couldn't handle... And about how many students too?

09:05.455 --> 09:05.535
Yes.

09:06.056 --> 09:07.898
I couldn't handle more than seven.

09:08.907 --> 09:30.595
because they came at that time with no Spanish, and I had, I used to have a blackboard out there, I'd take out the pickup every morning would sit out there, there are little pollinating stools, I think there's some pictures around somewhere of this, and for the first

09:31.182 --> 09:36.170
I used to teach them Spanish, but Spanish, usable Spanish.

09:36.391 --> 09:42.180
They had to communicate with the laborers and with the Mexican scientists.

09:43.222 --> 09:49.251
And then all the rest of the day in the plots and in the laboratories, whatever was being done.

09:49.852 --> 09:53.258
And then they would

09:54.453 --> 09:55.875
go back to their own countries.

09:56.216 --> 10:04.670
Well, this nursery has grown so that it's grown at about 150 locations at the present time around the world.

10:04.690 --> 10:10.580
And it generates tremendous amount of data that come back and go through the computers in Simmon.

10:10.601 --> 10:13.926
And there's a publication made each year and distributed worldwide.

10:14.086 --> 10:17.372
And this, for those who know how to use it,

10:18.314 --> 10:21.717
It gives a tremendous amount of data about where do we go from here?

10:21.837 --> 10:25.761
How do we correct for this disease susceptibility?

10:25.961 --> 10:29.024
What are the parental materials we should use?

10:29.764 --> 10:33.127
It's kind of a Bible or a Koran for those who know how to use it.

10:34.749 --> 10:40.374
And tell me now about the growth and how many students there were then versus how many there are now in the same staff.

10:40.394 --> 10:40.694
About seven.

10:40.714 --> 10:42.195
Seven.

10:42.215 --> 10:47.460
Now, of course, the structure is entirely different because CIMIT has, at the present time,

10:47.828 --> 10:59.166
In the two sections, that is the small grain training section, we have one, two, three full-time training officers.

11:00.969 --> 11:02.311
And the same in MACE.

11:03.373 --> 11:07.379
And each year... So you have about six then all together.

11:07.399 --> 11:08.921
And about how many students?

11:09.983 --> 11:14.410
About 115 in the two sections a year.

11:14.947 --> 11:18.752
And the number is restricted to that because of lack of dormitory space.

11:21.695 --> 11:23.458
Dormitory and cafeteria.

11:24.319 --> 11:33.891
We've got the teaching and capabilities of handling twice that, but we've got this bottleneck.

11:33.911 --> 11:40.079
So they come now for six months, and I think it's one of the good hands-on training programs.

11:40.099 --> 11:44.464
Now, as these people went back from those early days,

11:46.115 --> 12:05.880
We used to try to, and one of the responsibilities today of the training officers is to maintain contact with those people, to visit them at least once every year, and now more often because we have some outposted staff of our researchers.

12:07.021 --> 12:13.229
So they're in regions, and so they're expected to visit them at least twice and sometimes more often.

12:13.249 --> 12:15.632
And we have regional get-togethers.

12:16.439 --> 12:18.783
where we bring them all back together as best we can.

12:19.384 --> 12:28.598
And it's become a pretty important fraternity of weed scientists across disciplines, too.

12:29.219 --> 12:32.545
We never tried to make specialists out of these people.

12:32.625 --> 12:35.109
As a matter of fact, we tried to do just the opposite.

12:36.371 --> 12:40.978
Because I had seen from the early years too many people who were trained

12:41.583 --> 12:47.811
Let's say they wanted to be a geneticist and plant breeder when they got back, why, they had to be everything.

12:47.831 --> 12:50.675
They had to be an agronomist and know something about soil.

12:50.735 --> 13:03.051
They had to know something about entomology, and so we tried to give them a background in all of those things with a pretty down-to-earth production orientation.

13:04.364 --> 13:11.357
And then we followed up on these students and we tried to identify those that were not swallowed up within their own environment.

13:12.479 --> 13:24.420
In most of those countries, as you well know, the environment is miserable from the standpoint of doing research or, for that matter, teaching.

13:25.863 --> 13:28.127
No funds, no transport.

13:28.580 --> 13:31.964
No facilities, even envelopes very often for seed.

13:32.264 --> 13:33.826
No notebooks.

13:34.006 --> 13:35.048
It's just miserable.

13:36.469 --> 13:37.450
At least it was then.

13:37.651 --> 13:42.036
And it's improved considerably now, but it's still bad by our standards.

13:43.097 --> 13:50.466
So you try to identify those that are still reasonably functional despite those handicaps.

13:51.127 --> 13:55.752
And those are the ones that we used to battle to get fellowships for.

13:56.339 --> 14:04.589
And at that period, the Rockefeller Foundation and Ford Foundation were rather generous in the numbers of fellowships that were given.

14:05.751 --> 14:07.693
And so we would identify these.

14:07.933 --> 14:18.627
They would come out to quite often American universities, Canadian sometimes, sometimes European.

14:19.688 --> 14:22.752
And then when they would go back,

14:24.554 --> 14:42.676
We found, and this was based on our experience in Mexico very often, if they had this practical training like we had given them several years before in Mexico, and then they got their degree, specialty, PhD.

14:43.417 --> 14:52.047
When they went back, they knew what was important and what was of secondary and tertiary importance, the order of priorities.

14:52.988 --> 14:56.331
They were able to sort out pretty well by themselves.

14:56.351 --> 15:12.787
And that's why I think that the training pattern that we followed in Mexico in the early days back in the Rockefeller program was a good one because it gave us some insights into this, what happened to young people when they came back from foreign graduate schools.

15:13.007 --> 15:21.375
If they went directly from undergraduate to a foreign graduate school and came back home with very few exceptions, they were worthless.

15:22.570 --> 15:27.117
because they had received such a high degree of specialization.

15:27.137 --> 15:29.139
They wouldn't find the place to apply it.

15:29.660 --> 15:37.972
They would be disillusioned, frustrated, and it would represent a bad investment in education.

15:37.992 --> 15:41.758
But they went out for a master's as they did in Mexico.

15:41.778 --> 15:50.991
They came back and the good ones who had done a good job in graduate school at master's level came with us to help train other new ones just coming in.

15:51.798 --> 16:00.171
And they stayed for two or three years more, and if they continued to show leadership ability as well as good scientific excellence, they went out for a doctorate.

16:00.191 --> 16:11.809
And when they came back, they were mature scientists because they had probably had five years of experience, three before they went for a master's and then two between master's and doctorate.

16:11.829 --> 16:14.673
And they never got confused by what was important.

16:15.054 --> 16:18.339
They came back and they hit the deck and they were running.

16:19.221 --> 16:20.202
And so we tried to

16:21.059 --> 16:45.368
inject this into the people we were training in North Africa and near the Middle East also, so that they wouldn't end up like so many of both the Indians and the Egyptians who were theorists rather than hands-on people.

16:45.648 --> 16:50.374
Now, you've sent out probably way over a thousand by now.

16:51.198 --> 16:58.343
I've lost track exactly, but well over 2,000 young people coming through the Mexican program.

16:58.483 --> 17:02.457
More than half have been wheat, probably

17:05.052 --> 17:10.520
If I were to make a guess, there are at least 1,400 that have gone through the Mexican wheat program.

17:10.580 --> 17:12.603
So they're scattered all around the world.

17:13.123 --> 17:14.726
They aren't all working on wheat.

17:14.746 --> 17:17.370
They're working on agriculture in the broadest of sense.

17:17.550 --> 17:18.151
Exactly.

17:18.591 --> 17:26.543
Now you have also done some follow-up and you keep in good contact with, maybe you not personally, but others keep in good contact.

17:26.743 --> 17:33.152
How do you judge or how do you measure the impact that your trained scientists have had on their cultures?

17:33.554 --> 17:45.708
Bernie Swanson, who came with our training program probably in about 66 or 67, he's now at the University of Illinois, and this is his career now.

17:45.728 --> 17:57.342
He spent, I guess, I'm not sure, four or five years with us, four years, and he started following up on these people.

17:57.362 --> 18:00.726
He helped structure in a more formal way

18:01.347 --> 18:27.878
also by then we were generating a CIMIT staff and we got, Bernie was there and then we got another training officer and they started structuring this much better than I had done when I was alone and they maintained correspondence

18:28.415 --> 18:33.803
And also, he's made one follow-up since then.

18:34.224 --> 18:43.759
And the surprising, I don't remember how many years back this was, but maybe four or so.

18:44.600 --> 18:47.104
He made a follow-up and amazing thing.

18:47.124 --> 18:47.925
By 1980 he made a follow-up then?

18:48.192 --> 18:49.434
Somewhere in there, 78 or 80.

18:49.454 --> 18:56.944
80% of all of them were still in wheat in some way or another, of the ones that were in wheat.

18:57.444 --> 19:02.491
Amazing, considering the miserable conditions there.

19:03.793 --> 19:14.267
And Rob, who got his masters here last year in Ag Ed,

19:14.939 --> 19:18.904
He did his three-month internship with us last summer.

19:19.525 --> 19:28.337
He was following up mostly by correspondence, trying to see what had happened since then.

19:28.538 --> 19:33.004
As a matter of fact, he's moved on to Illinois now and working on his doctorate there.

19:33.084 --> 19:33.925
Did you ever meet him?

19:34.325 --> 19:41.335
Tall, slim guy, came from Pennsylvania originally, went into the Peace Corps and then into

19:42.547 --> 19:44.091
I guess he was in this twice.

19:47.420 --> 19:52.253
In Nepal, the last time, then he worked collecting

19:52.840 --> 19:59.566
parasites of wild animals for some German scientific organization for a couple of years.

19:59.626 --> 20:03.169
He's had a fantastic background of experience.

20:03.830 --> 20:19.284
He married a little Nepalese gal and he was in my class last year and he didn't have to do a three-month sort of in-service training, so he went down and did this and now he's working on his doctor.

20:19.364 --> 20:22.527
Well, I've noticed

20:23.587 --> 20:27.412
that with our system of education here in the U.S.

20:27.513 --> 20:42.474
now, the early specialization and also drawing, we must remember that only 2% of the economically active workforce of the U.S.

20:42.494 --> 20:45.358
population today is agricultural.

20:45.760 --> 20:49.926
That means that many of our students have no feel for agriculture.

20:49.946 --> 20:56.195
Even though they're registered in agriculture, they have no feel for the basics.

20:57.356 --> 21:03.826
They were probably born in New York City, Brooklyn, and this handicaps them very greatly.

21:04.286 --> 21:12.578
We have to get back to this question, though, of trained specialists and how, I mean, what did you find in about 1980?

21:12.777 --> 21:15.061
what did they find when they went out and they asked these people?

21:15.141 --> 21:19.047
I mean, have they had much of an impact on agriculture in their countries?

21:19.407 --> 21:26.859
You said that 80% were still in wheat, which is fantastic, the retention rate, but what kind of impact?

21:27.039 --> 21:30.184
Is there any way that you can measure that?

21:30.765 --> 21:31.045
Is there?

21:31.626 --> 21:36.794
Well, the way we try to measure it, what happened to wheat production in those countries?

21:37.435 --> 21:41.181
In Turkey, for example, wheat production has doubled in the

21:41.684 --> 21:46.069
last 10, 12 years, and they were an integral part of this.

21:46.770 --> 21:53.318
Pakistan, there were 18 of them in those early years that went through, and this is triple.

21:54.720 --> 21:56.823
Pakistan's lead production's tripled.

21:57.604 --> 21:58.345
Since 1965.

21:58.985 --> 22:03.231
India's is quadruple.

22:04.032 --> 22:08.417
Now, India is one of the god-awfulest bureaucracies.

22:09.680 --> 22:27.807
And it chokes them, but despite all of that, of course we had the late Dr. Glenn Anderson there to provide an umbrella and he was respected and he had their confidence and he was kind of the big uncle and he could talk pretty frank to them.

22:27.989 --> 22:37.640
Just as in the early years, Narvaez, my first Mexican colleague, was in Pakistan for a shorter period of time, I think only three years.

22:38.240 --> 22:40.983
But he too had tremendous impact.

22:41.684 --> 22:45.929
Especially then you can protect these people and keep them going in the right direction.

22:46.269 --> 22:50.634
Now in Egypt, we've trained a tremendous number there.

22:50.654 --> 22:54.638
But Egypt is, since you pointed or asked this question,

22:55.293 --> 23:04.145
I'm not sure which is worse, Egypt or India from the standpoint of bureaucracy.

23:04.786 --> 23:08.170
They probably are on a par, which is bad.

23:09.552 --> 23:24.793
The difference is in their agriculture, Egyptian yields were at a higher level than India's or Pakistan's when we started in those countries.

23:25.803 --> 23:29.447
Those countries have advanced more yield-wise and production-wise.

23:31.229 --> 23:40.959
But Egypt also has one thing that's an advantage and I dare say also a disadvantage.

23:40.979 --> 23:51.010
Because of its relations with the USA, to get the political leaders to make a tough decision on agriculture is more difficult.

23:51.170 --> 23:52.992
Would you explain that?

23:53.849 --> 24:10.633
USAID has probably poured more aid into Egypt because of the position that it occupies with respect to the whole confused situation between Israel and the Arab countries than any other country in that entire region.

24:11.634 --> 24:21.949
And so the political leaders know that if things get bad enough,

24:22.216 --> 24:24.719
there will always be PL 480 grain.

24:26.622 --> 24:30.366
That's a disincentive as far as I'm concerned.

24:30.386 --> 24:49.911
Because before we could ever move production, after we had put the technological package together in India and Pakistan, and we had tested it the first year on dozens of farms and then hundreds, probably close to thousands, and

24:49.992 --> 24:52.014
We could see it was viable.

24:52.895 --> 24:54.236
The grass roots were a fire.

24:54.537 --> 24:56.859
They could see the tremendous difference.

24:58.020 --> 25:00.063
And we did this intentionally.

25:00.083 --> 25:06.570
We weren't looking for the most economic part of that fertilizer response curve.

25:06.590 --> 25:18.362
When those went out onto the hundreds and thousands of farms, simple plots, I wanted this to be something approaching the maximum.

25:20.266 --> 25:26.235
I wasn't at the stage where I was interested in the equity of distribution of that fertilizer.

25:26.255 --> 25:28.499
I wanted to provoke shock.

25:28.519 --> 25:46.887
And although from research we had the curves, what the response increase in yield would be with 20, with 40, with 80, with 120, with 160 pounds of nitrogen and a low level of phosphate.

25:46.907 --> 25:48.990
I wanted to play the one at 120.

25:50.388 --> 25:58.900
And I had one of my most bitter fights with the economists in India, especially because they're very sophisticated there.

25:59.381 --> 26:01.244
They started talking about equity.

26:01.584 --> 26:03.066
You can't do this.

26:03.086 --> 26:06.171
And I say, this is not the time to talk about equity.

26:06.711 --> 26:09.455
This is the time to talk about shock.

26:09.475 --> 26:11.578
And it was brutal, the discussion.

26:12.480 --> 26:13.161
I finally won.

26:13.782 --> 26:14.843
And we put them out there.

26:15.042 --> 26:19.028
Can you explain this a little bit more?

26:19.088 --> 26:19.689
Yes.

26:19.889 --> 26:27.700
If you put 40 pounds of nitrogen on, you will get a modest increase, let's say, with the phosphate tube.

26:27.720 --> 26:36.713
Then, as some of my good critics, including Paddock, said, even when it started to show on the national scale,

26:37.942 --> 26:40.485
Those differences are because of climate.

26:40.765 --> 26:42.186
It rained better this year.

26:42.847 --> 26:47.131
A whole series of intangibles, and there was no real change in yield.

26:48.192 --> 26:50.715
I anticipated all of this nonsense.

26:52.177 --> 26:59.884
So I wanted not 40, not 80, 120, so that a blind man could see it.

26:59.985 --> 27:05.350
The differences would be between 10 bushels an acre and 80 bushels.

27:07.878 --> 27:08.639
And this was done.

27:10.361 --> 27:14.506
And every place you had those plots, where somebody... This was done in Egypt?

27:14.666 --> 27:16.268
No, this was done in India.

27:16.628 --> 27:17.809
Oh, okay, in India, okay.

27:17.829 --> 27:19.531
And Pakistan.

27:19.551 --> 27:19.832
Oh yeah, okay.

27:21.594 --> 27:35.590
And when you would drive out in a jeep to stop quick with your Indian or Pakistani friends to look at this, you probably only spent

27:35.958 --> 27:45.352
planned to spend, because the treatments were simple, only a few of them, to spend eight, ten minutes.

27:46.354 --> 27:53.044
By the time you started coming out of the plot, there were hundreds of people standing around because of the population density.

27:53.084 --> 27:57.331
But the word would get around to the village that these people are here looking at this.

27:58.232 --> 28:01.257
And those people had seen it before, it was obvious.

28:01.962 --> 28:08.151
Somebody would grab you by the sleeve and, in Hindi, point down the road, meaning you're supposed to come down and see his.

28:09.413 --> 28:15.122
But, of course, the people we were with, the extension people, we could only stop at a certain number.

28:16.644 --> 28:23.033
But this created such a grassroots fire.

28:24.135 --> 28:30.805
People knew what could be done then if the government made it possible for them to have those inputs.

28:31.004 --> 28:41.955
When this was done, when you do this on an experiment station, I heard this in Mexico and I used to listen to them in Spanish, especially the uneducated little Indian farmer.

28:41.975 --> 28:49.082
They'd say, well, but the government can do this because they got the fertilizer and we don't have any money.

28:50.083 --> 28:50.884
We can't do this.

28:51.704 --> 28:56.269
Besides, I could read between the lines and say,

28:56.840 --> 29:05.995
We aren't so sure what's going on here on this experiment station, how much of this is improved technology and how much of this is hocus-pocus.

29:06.917 --> 29:14.209
But when you do it on their own farms and the owners there, when you put in the test, it changes the whole thing.

29:14.269 --> 29:19.658
He's the best extension man that you can ever find.

29:22.068 --> 29:30.716
Quite often you tried to pick a village leader also, recognizing that that's a way to spread it.

29:30.736 --> 29:38.843
And sometimes you didn't get the right person, but generally it was... Now can you relate this to Egypt?

29:39.163 --> 29:49.472
In Egypt we never went through this in the same way, because we never had staff posted there.

29:49.492 --> 29:50.353
We used to visit.

29:51.700 --> 29:53.743
And we had some of the best young scientists there.

29:54.884 --> 29:57.828
But we had limited number of staff.

29:59.850 --> 30:04.196
And so we were sent to the worst places in those early years.

30:04.356 --> 30:09.022
That was India and Pakistan at that time where the real problem areas, this was back in the early 60s.

30:09.603 --> 30:12.446
Now, let me just finish on this other thing.

30:12.466 --> 30:15.971
By the time you'd gone around, I don't know whether we talked about this or not.

30:16.451 --> 30:18.754
This was in the spring of 66.

30:19.544 --> 30:21.807
And we're back in Pakistan and India now?

30:21.827 --> 30:23.408
Let's confine it to India.

30:23.869 --> 30:23.969
Okay.

30:24.049 --> 30:25.451
We had traveled for a month.

30:25.471 --> 30:26.352
We got through the war.

30:28.074 --> 30:30.417
Well, this was the year after that.

30:30.657 --> 30:31.658
Okay.

30:31.678 --> 30:38.085
When the seed didn't germinate and everything was bad and we doubled the seeding rates, you remember, and it turned out very well.

30:38.546 --> 30:48.117
And then Mr. Subramaniam, who will be coming to this water conference, he was then the Secretary of Food and Agriculture, both.

30:48.957 --> 30:50.879
he made a tough decision.

30:51.240 --> 30:59.110
He imported 18,000 tons of Mexican wheat seed against the advice of his senior scientist.

31:00.712 --> 31:09.643
And this that I've just been describing now was that set the stage for him importing this.

31:09.663 --> 31:11.826
The next year then as we looked at this,

31:13.527 --> 31:15.430
The enthusiasm was tremendous.

31:15.751 --> 31:18.175
And I don't know whether I've mentioned this or not.

31:18.576 --> 31:31.658
The last day before Swaminathan and Anderson and Kohli and I came back to Delhi after we'd been out for between four and five weeks looking at this all across the countryside in the spring of March of 66.

31:33.502 --> 31:38.370
March of 67.

31:40.932 --> 31:50.847
We got a telegram from the minister that we were supposed to stop at the Escort Tractor Factory, which is about 60 miles from Delhi.

31:51.748 --> 31:55.273
This was the only factory making small tractors.

31:55.354 --> 32:10.416
The reason we were invited to stop there, the Polish ambassador, the head of the company, was giving this luncheon in his honor.

32:10.733 --> 32:16.103
It so happened that all of that tractor, except the transmission, was made in India.

32:16.143 --> 32:19.009
The transmission came from Poland.

32:19.029 --> 32:22.516
And so the ambassador was there and the whole Indian press was there.

32:23.477 --> 32:25.982
Pretty elegant luncheon.

32:26.062 --> 32:32.134
As we drove up a little late, the whole patio, the whole yard in front of the factory,

32:32.890 --> 32:35.894
was filled with unsold little tractors.

32:36.896 --> 32:44.646
So we went to the luncheon and the ambassador spoke and Mr. Nanda, N-A-N-D-A, the president of Escort, spoke.

32:45.788 --> 32:51.876
Then he said, maybe Dr. Borlaug would like to say a few words and I figured there's the podium.

32:51.917 --> 32:58.746
So I told him what we had seen and I said, Mr. Nanda, if the government does three things now,

33:00.278 --> 33:10.111
All of those tractors you've got out here in the front patio will be sold and you won't be able to catch up with back orders for years to come.

33:10.131 --> 33:18.081
If there's fertilizer available at reasonable price, credit for the farmer to pay for it, buy it and pay for it at harvest.

33:18.101 --> 33:28.395
And if the government announces before planting a fair price for the grain at harvest based on the international market price, this is going to fly.

33:29.050 --> 33:35.699
And I said, I wish now that I were a member of the Lak Saba.

33:35.719 --> 33:37.742
The Lak Saba is the Chamber of Deputies.

33:38.603 --> 33:48.797
I said, were I a member, I would stand up every 15 minutes irrespective of what was being discussed and scream in a loud voice what we need now is fertilizer.

33:48.895 --> 33:53.161
There was a big hee-hawing around there, especially from the press.

33:54.984 --> 34:01.934
It turned out the next morning we were in Delhi and went to see the minister and told him what we had seen.

34:02.054 --> 34:04.919
He said, yeah, I saw the whole headlines on the press also.

34:06.160 --> 34:10.146
And he says, I understand the cards you're playing.

34:10.166 --> 34:13.411
He says, I believe you, but I can't help you anymore.

34:13.431 --> 34:16.776
I'm out of office tomorrow night at midnight.

34:17.735 --> 34:20.418
He lost his seat.

34:21.820 --> 34:24.844
Then he sent me to the Prime Minister.

34:24.864 --> 34:25.965
He played rough cards.

34:26.085 --> 34:27.968
I think that's on the tape.

34:28.869 --> 34:32.253
Those were the decisive things that made it fly.

34:33.234 --> 34:44.308
The thing that set the stage was not in India, but was first in Pakistan, where they committed themselves to that three things.

34:44.328 --> 34:47.472
That was done a year earlier than in India.

34:48.548 --> 34:55.196
with President Liu, he said, that's the way it'll be.

34:55.877 --> 34:57.999
And then you could use this.

34:58.059 --> 35:15.300
You could say, I'm not above exploiting these things to move one country ahead while saying, look what so-and-so did, if it's for the improvement of the people.

35:16.441 --> 35:17.442
And I used to say,

35:17.793 --> 35:26.044
in India, your friends to the West have made this decision on fertilizer, on credit, and on price.

35:28.027 --> 35:29.268
You're going to be left behind.

35:31.091 --> 35:36.137
You have to be a bit of a psychologist in this also.

35:37.399 --> 35:39.442
Because that's the way the world is organized.

35:40.223 --> 35:41.785
You wouldn't wish it were so.

35:43.647 --> 35:47.192
One would wish that those national borders

35:47.780 --> 35:51.045
weren't there so that we would think as a people, but it isn't so.

35:53.449 --> 35:55.031
I'm sorry I wandered around so much.

35:55.232 --> 36:15.002
No, no, I wanted to... So Egypt, I must say, we never put a major push into Egypt, knowing full well that because of this prop, in times of need, we would never be able to exert pressures that we... In other words, USAID, because of USAID,

36:15.640 --> 36:23.991
And I had one experience where I took our program out of the country because of similar things.

36:24.011 --> 36:24.492
What was that?

36:24.752 --> 36:27.976
Morocco, which needed it very badly.

36:28.297 --> 36:30.439
Oh, can you explain that?

36:30.459 --> 36:33.664
We started working in Morocco.

36:33.984 --> 36:42.475
See, we didn't have much manpower, so we had to, in those early times, we'd just die and Glenn Anderson and a few people who work in India and Pakistan.

36:42.927 --> 36:48.353
Then as we started acquiring a staff, we started to look where we could be effective.

36:49.154 --> 36:56.122
And in North Africa, we started to work in Tunisia and Morocco.

36:58.485 --> 37:02.870
But we soon backed off in Morocco because the U.S.

37:03.891 --> 37:06.814
naval and air base was there.

37:06.834 --> 37:12.040
And whenever I tried to exert pressures on economic policy,

37:13.285 --> 37:17.970
USAID officer would say, oh, you can't do that.

37:18.892 --> 37:30.926
I said, all right, then we won't play because we haven't scientific manpower to waste where we aren't going to try to get a result.

37:30.946 --> 37:35.751
And if it's tied up in politics, better we use the limited manpower we have elsewhere.

37:36.312 --> 37:37.714
So we left.

37:38.795 --> 37:39.996
We were there about three years.

37:40.157 --> 37:43.140
We had one good man there, two good men.

37:45.871 --> 37:48.774
So that you've got to recognize— And airweed production has stayed about the same.

37:49.034 --> 37:53.339
Now it's starting to pick up, but that's, let's see.

37:57.183 --> 37:58.324
It could have picked up in the 70s.

37:58.344 --> 37:59.465
Fifteen years, yes.

38:01.247 --> 38:05.412
Of course, they hadn't done a decent job of training their people also.

38:06.773 --> 38:13.380
Agriculture wasn't considered to be important by the king, and it had no priority, and they had a—

38:13.850 --> 38:25.747
a very ineffective director of agricultural research who did good lip service but nothing else in support of research.

38:25.767 --> 38:43.232
When you find a situation like that, rather than hit your head against the wall when there's so many other places with the limited resources, man, human resources and budget, that you need to work and then wait till the situation is right.

38:44.225 --> 38:45.727
Morocco is starting to move now.

38:48.311 --> 38:54.460
Now, by the late ... And Tunisia is moving pretty well now.

38:55.722 --> 38:58.847
We don't have any people posted there, but we did for a while.

38:59.608 --> 39:06.358
And of those North African countries, it's got the best agricultural program of the bunch.

39:07.219 --> 39:09.122
Algeria, we worked in for a while.

39:09.322 --> 39:13.168
Of course, it ...

39:14.617 --> 39:23.027
had the most tangled up mess because of land ownership after the colons left, the French colons.

39:23.848 --> 39:25.510
And they had no trained people.

39:25.530 --> 39:36.602
When they got their independence, there were only 18 people with university degrees in the whole country, none of them in agriculture.

39:36.622 --> 39:39.145
Let's move to the so-called Green Revolution.

39:39.706 --> 39:41.468
Do you remember when you first heard that term?

39:43.270 --> 39:44.631
Do you know the origin of that term?

39:44.651 --> 39:46.413
Yes, I know the origin of that term.

39:47.134 --> 40:09.598
I can't tell you the exact year, but it's either 19, I imagine it's in the USAID's annual report of 1968, written by Dr. William Dowd, D-A-U-D, he passed away several years ago, and he used

40:10.017 --> 40:25.578
in his report this term, he says something is beginning to happen in increased production of wheat in India and Pakistan.

40:26.219 --> 40:29.263
It may be a green revolution or words to this effect.

40:30.325 --> 40:36.413
And you can find this either in the USAID report

40:37.270 --> 40:44.040
for I would suspect it's 67 or 68 or 69.

40:44.641 --> 40:46.784
My belief is it'll be 68.

40:46.964 --> 40:52.112
That's where the term was first used.

40:52.132 --> 40:53.574
What did you think of the term then and now?

40:54.896 --> 41:05.792
Well I was never too happy about the situation because it soon became so all-inclusive that everyone got

41:06.059 --> 41:10.470
false hopes that suddenly there was no problem on food.

41:11.312 --> 41:22.600
The general press, of course, this was never Dowd's intention, nor certainly any of ours, because it's producing food for

41:25.229 --> 41:27.512
4 billion people, or it's today 4.9.

41:27.753 --> 41:36.767
There's no easy situation, especially when our population continues to increase at 84 million more each year.

41:37.387 --> 41:54.173
But beyond that, the really only sizable change, big change in production, yield-wise and production-wise, on basic crops has been

41:54.760 --> 42:20.548
wheat and rice corn hasn't moved like it should and it's the one that sorghum and corn in Africa has to do what happened on wheat and rice in Asia in the last two decades this has to happen it can be made to happen but it can't be made to happen by writing more learned reports there's altogether too much

42:22.216 --> 42:38.713
stuff being written on a theoretical basis from air-conditioned offices in the US and Europe which is where most of our best critics sit that has no relevance to what goes on out there in the field.

42:38.773 --> 42:43.238
Okay let's talk about some of the critics.

42:43.558 --> 42:49.945
I've become somewhat familiar with a lot of the criticisms and I'd just like you to answer

42:51.022 --> 42:51.623
answer these.

42:51.643 --> 42:56.728
Some of these you have answered already, but I'd like to get it on tape.

42:56.768 --> 43:20.151
Now, one of the critics stated that Dr. William Paddock, I'm sure you're probably familiar with his family in 1975, America's decision, who will be survived, has leveled the criticism that the Green Revolution resulted from better winter conditions in the late 1960s.

43:20.182 --> 43:46.299
This was precisely why I made the decision that we were going to apply in those demonstrations on farms 120 kilos of nitrogen, 120 pounds per acre, rather than 40 to take the wind out of such a statement because no one had ever seen 80 bushel wheat before.

43:46.319 --> 43:49.463
When you go from 10 to 80 or 85 bushels an acre,

43:51.181 --> 43:54.807
It wasn't the weather.

43:54.827 --> 44:11.973
Maybe it didn't convince him, but those hundreds of thousands or millions of simple farmers, they knew something was happening, even though it didn't echo back into Bill Paddock's office in Washington, D.C.

44:14.116 --> 44:15.659
We had many of those kinds of critics.

44:16.380 --> 44:16.480
Okay.

44:16.898 --> 44:46.197
okay and over time of course the weather conditions probably changed considerably didn't they sure and how did crops do they continue in 1979 was reputed to have been the driest year in 70 some years during that year in India rice production and wheat production both

44:46.514 --> 45:13.500
fell but they were carrying in warehouse 20 million tons we didn't hear any about famine they came through the next year with production was up again not only to the level of the year before but another couple million tons and last year it was compared to the five-year average of 60 to 66

45:14.155 --> 45:20.001
65, which was just under 11 million tons, just under 400 million bushels.

45:20.361 --> 45:33.035
Last harvest of 84 was 45.1 million metric tons, that's about 1,650,000,000 bushels, more than 4-4.

45:34.456 --> 45:39.201
Again, they've got a large reserve of wheat,

45:39.839 --> 46:09.745
rice in their warehouses something in the order of 22 23 million tons this past winter has been extremely dry again but they're in good shape the the data are not in yet on the yield but it will probably be down a million or two tons but compared to where it was sure sure yeah he also criticized you by saying that Borlaug's grains are a lower nutritional value than the earlier ones

46:10.045 --> 46:12.989
This is just a bunch of nonsense.

46:13.450 --> 46:16.053
There's a grain of truth in this.

46:16.073 --> 46:27.369
Whenever you have, and this is what makes it very difficult to cut off all of these statements.

46:27.469 --> 46:38.584
For example, this was a charge that the wheats were moving in, displacing grain legumes and pulses.

46:39.053 --> 46:45.423
For example, chickpea and lentil and the other legumes.

46:46.945 --> 46:53.214
And you see, this brings back this point we talked about earlier in the high lysine corn.

46:54.536 --> 47:08.537
When you eat cereals and then, whether it's chickpea or lentil or false peas, any of those, they tend to balance each other

47:08.956 --> 47:20.508
the lysine's essential amino acids in the grain legumes will compensate for the low essential amino acids in the cereals and vice versa.

47:21.329 --> 47:23.472
And so you balance your diet this way.

47:23.492 --> 47:29.018
That's been going on since the early times of agriculture.

47:29.258 --> 47:30.940
How they hit on this, we don't know.

47:31.660 --> 47:36.786
Okay, so the cliche that gave rise to this was that

47:37.222 --> 47:43.411
Wheat was moving in, the acreage of pulses was going down.

47:44.973 --> 47:48.999
The total area planted to those winter, because they couldn't compete.

47:49.560 --> 47:57.611
And so they immediately said that the nutritional levels had to be going down.

47:57.671 --> 48:03.820
