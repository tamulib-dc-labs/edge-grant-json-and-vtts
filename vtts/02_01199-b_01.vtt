WEBVTT

00:04.030 --> 00:08.297
Okay, let's try a volume check.

00:11.262 --> 00:16.951
Okay, this is Ron Shorn, and I'm interviewing Jack 
Brandt, and for the record, give your full name. My

00:18.674 --> 00:19.976
entire full name? John Conrad Brandt, Jr. Okay, 
and when were you born? I was born on... Well,

00:26.626 --> 00:31.354
that's actually a tricky question. but it will 
give you insight into how my life has gone. I was

00:37.059 --> 00:39.284
actually born on August 7th, 1934. Both my mother 
and father agreed that I was born on August 7th,

00:41.288 --> 00:45.396
1934. However, the city of St. Louis says I was born 
on August 8th, 1934. So it turns out I ran afoul of

00:53.103 --> 01:03.177
bureaucracy essentially on square one and have 
been running afoul of bureaucracies ever since.

01:04.058 --> 01:05.480
How did you get interested in astronomy?

01:08.544 --> 01:16.555
You know, that is really hard to say, but I can, it's 
the kind of thing that I think is very natural to

01:08.544 --> 01:16.555
people. But the specific thing that I can remember 
is writing a paper very early in my college career

01:24.862 --> 01:37.076
on the determination of the speed of light by Ole 
Romer and whoever worked with him from the

01:24.862 --> 01:37.076
satellites of Jupiter. And I was impressed that 
such a basically simple approach to a fairly

01:38.237 --> 01:51.372
fundamental observation could yield, ballpark, 
the correct results. And this idea of being able to

01:54.798 --> 02:01.184
use your wits to determine what's going on in a 
cosmic sense appealed to me. And I guess it was

02:01.244 --> 02:03.807
downhill from there on. Where did you get your 
undergraduate degree and when? Undergraduate

02:07.571 --> 02:12.095
degree at Washington University in St. Louis in 
1956. And what was your major? Mathematics. And

02:15.058 --> 02:17.701
then where did you go to grad school? I went to grad 
school twice. The first time was at the University

02:19.322 --> 02:21.885
of Chicago. 56 to 60 when I got a degree, PhD, in 
astronomy. And then due to various malfeasances

02:30.289 --> 02:45.471
of the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration from 1981 to 1983, I went to

02:30.289 --> 02:45.471
graduate school at Loyola College in Baltimore 
and obtained a Master of Business

02:30.289 --> 02:45.471
Administration.

02:48.195 --> 02:49.617
Who was your thesis advisor? What was your thesis 
advisor? My thesis was on different ways of

02:50.603 --> 02:57.988
producing lime and alpha radiation in the solar 
system. This included some planets and And what

03:02.568 --> 03:09.876
was then called the interplanetary medium, the 
solar wind hadn't actually been fully invented

03:02.568 --> 03:09.876
yet. It was around, but not used. And my thesis 
advisor was Joseph Chamberlain. How did you get

03:15.342 --> 03:19.567
interested in that field? Did they pick you, or did 
you go around and pick something else? It was sort

03:22.810 --> 03:24.192
of a little bit of both. When I first went to Yerkes, 
I was, of course, taking courses. And I had a

03:29.197 --> 03:40.529
one-year research assistantship on the 
astrometry project that was being run by Kai

03:29.197 --> 03:40.529
Strand at the time. And I quickly determined that I 
was not all that interested in astrometry. And

03:46.515 --> 03:56.605
this guy named Joe Chamberlain seemed to be doing 
interesting physics in the atmospheres of

03:46.515 --> 03:56.605
planets, and he was also working on solar wind 
theory at the time. The juncture was natural and I

03:57.125 --> 04:00.169
think he's been very productive.

04:02.873 --> 04:04.375
Where did you go after you got your PhD? The first 
year after the PhD I spent, I was a something called

04:05.036 --> 04:12.647
an NSF cooperative.

04:16.012 --> 04:19.437
Cooperative, oh boy, it's been a long time. but 
some kind of postdoctoral fellowship that

04:20.395 --> 04:29.768
involved the postdoctoral institution 
contributing resources and NSF paid the salary.

04:30.509 --> 04:37.839
And that was essentially late 60 to late 61 at Mount 
Wilson and Palomar, literally on 813 Santa

04:30.509 --> 04:37.839
Barbara Street. And where'd you go from there? And 
I came to Berkeley. and I stayed here a year and a

04:42.755 --> 05:11.513
half and then I went to Kitt Peak in early 63 and 
stayed there for three years and then in 66 I went to

04:42.755 --> 05:11.513
the Goddard Institute for Space Studies and 
stayed there about a year and they were then trying

04:42.755 --> 05:11.513
to get people to go to Goddard and run things so I 
started out in the solar physics branch in 1967 as I

05:12.235 --> 05:35.256
think Ed was the technical title, and then I was 
made chief of the Laboratory for Solar Physics,

05:12.235 --> 05:35.256
and that evolved and amalgamated, and for about 
the last 10 years at Goddard, which ended in 87, so

05:12.235 --> 05:35.256
from 77 to 87, I was chief of the Laboratory for 
Astronomy and Solar Physics.

05:35.540 --> 05:45.798
And then I went to the University of Colorado, 
where I am senior research associate and

05:35.540 --> 05:45.798
professor, paren, attendant rank, close paren. 
I'm just, I'm not making this up. I'll give you my

05:48.903 --> 05:50.526
card if you don't believe it. Of astrophysical, 
planetary, and atmospheric sciences. We require

05:55.274 --> 05:57.919
documentation for that, so...

06:03.620 --> 06:05.762
Okay, do you consider yourself an astronomer? 
Yeah. And do you consider yourself a solar system

06:07.103 --> 06:09.566
astronomer? A what? A solar system or planetary 
astronomer or just plain astronomer? I consider

06:13.730 --> 06:14.550
both. Okay. Usually the world, for reasons which 
are not sound, describes all astronomers into

06:16.532 --> 06:28.184
solar system people and the equivalent of 
astrophysicists. I am both. Back

06:31.261 --> 06:40.575
in the early 60s, did you feel looked down upon by 
real quote-unquote astronomers? Well, I'm

06:40.595 --> 06:45.783
absolutely sure that real astronomers tried to 
look down on me, but I didn't let them. And I'm being

06:45.803 --> 06:49.388
slightly serious. for quite some time, have 
chosen the things to work on that I was interested

06:50.380 --> 06:59.715
in for what I perceived to be their intrinsic merit 
and interest to me. And if somebody else doesn't

06:59.915 --> 07:05.123
think that's important, that's, in my personal 
opinion, their problem. Do you think that real

07:06.566 --> 07:13.797
astronomers look down on planetary anything 
closer in the light year, back in the 60s? And do

07:13.817 --> 07:14.538
they do it now? Well, they certainly did in the 60s.

07:19.439 --> 07:26.788
But this is simply a mental aberration that should 
not be unduly dignified. There is a huge tendency

07:27.469 --> 07:38.924
in astronomy for anybody working in any field to 
regard anything that that person is not

07:27.469 --> 07:38.924
personally working on as unimportant. And I think 
it far transcends the astrophysicists looking

07:42.203 --> 07:52.616
down on the solar system people and you can even 
take it farther and then you get into the

07:42.203 --> 07:52.616
astrophysicists, the people that work on 
cosmology and quasars look down on the stellar

07:42.203 --> 07:52.616
people. And it's sort of another form of prejudice 
in our society that shouldn't be unduly

07:53.297 --> 07:59.224
dignified. What was astronomy and planetary 
astronomy like when you got started as opposed to

07:59.244 --> 08:05.832
today? I don't know about as opposed to today. We 
were just starting to get into missions to

08:08.317 --> 08:14.927
planets, which, of course, were very exciting.

08:15.582 --> 08:23.835
A lot of the work that I did first with Joe 
Chamberlain with myself was some of the first work

08:15.582 --> 08:23.835
done on, for example, Lyman Alpha from the 
planets. And half of my astronomer friends didn't

08:23.855 --> 08:30.947
know what Lyman Alpha was, which I found somewhat 
amusing. But I'm sorry, I tilted it back at the

08:30.967 --> 08:34.031
wrong time. What's the best piece of work that you 
think you've done? If they had to be carved on a

08:39.460 --> 08:41.303
tombstone. That would be awfully hard to pin down. 
As you know, Ron, my approach to astronomy has been

08:49.784 --> 08:55.311
somewhat eclectic. I've done archaeoastronomy, 
I've done rotation curves of galaxies, fiddled

08:55.331 --> 09:01.579
with the gum nebula. I was the principal 
investigator for the GHRS, which has contributed

09:02.660 --> 09:09.949
to lots of disciplines. I have I helped found the 
International Halley Watch. I helped start the

09:14.591 --> 09:18.154
Solar Maximum Mission. Anything that I have done, 
the more recent stuff that I'm doing right now, I'm

09:19.896 --> 09:26.183
as proud of as anything. That is, I think we have 
pinned down to within all a reasonable doubt what

09:27.064 --> 09:39.117
the source of disconnection events in comets 
might be. And the answer is? And the answer is

09:41.895 --> 09:51.272
magnetic reconnection of sector boundaries, 
which is what we proposed 15 years ago, but we

09:41.895 --> 09:51.272
didn't have, that was a good speculation, we 
didn't have the evidence to back it up. I think we

09:51.332 --> 09:52.714
have the evidence now. But, you know, it's sort of 
like asking somebody what their favorite child

09:53.295 --> 09:57.122
is. I view whatever my contribution is to 
astronomy to be in multiple areas, including

10:04.612 --> 10:12.145
trying to run a NASA laboratory intelligently, 
helping sell missions. I think 50 years from now,

10:13.167 --> 10:18.576
stuff I did on the International Halley Watch may 
be what I'm remembered by. I really don't know.

10:20.700 --> 10:21.962
What was the most fun? Well, you

10:22.533 --> 10:43.095
know, that is very hard to say, but I think selling 
the GHRS because everybody told us as the Goddard

10:22.533 --> 10:43.095
high resolution spectrograph on the Hubble Space 
Telescope, everybody told us in 1976 and 1977 that

10:22.533 --> 10:43.095
a proposal from a NASA lab didn't have a chance of a 
snowball and you know where. And of course we were

10:43.976 --> 10:48.220
category one and selected and it's up and working. 
Again, when you want singles, you know, I'll tell

10:49.904 --> 10:57.235
you stuff that I consider to be exciting and 
productive, but it's hard to pin down. Did you ever

10:57.255 --> 11:01.461
have any dead ends, misfires, things like that? 
Sure, dead ends and misfires. I had the most

11:03.163 --> 11:08.270
wonderful theory of the blue clearing on Mars. 
That would be totally wrong. But it was a great

11:10.814 --> 11:12.236
theory. What was it? Well, at that time there was 
evidence, which we now know to be false, that the

11:14.187 --> 11:21.680
solar wind might stop around 2 AU. And so we 
postulated that it stopped, obviously, around

11:22.802 --> 11:30.154
the orbit of Mars and that the eccentricity would 
carry it in and out of this boundary. Absolutely

11:30.956 --> 11:34.622
wonderful theory that had nothing to do with 
reality. When did you first cross swords with an

11:35.443 --> 11:38.288
ASA? Yeah, I wouldn't say that I have crossed 
swords with NASA, although NASA might have an

11:39.702 --> 11:48.871
alternate view.

11:53.476 --> 12:08.832
Well, I was whilst at Kitt Peak involved with, I 
think it was Mariner 4, with an experiment that

11:53.476 --> 12:08.832
Charlie Barth was doing when he was still at JPL. 
Now, I may have this a little garbled, because as

12:09.925 --> 12:14.912
you know, that was 30 years ago. And something 
happened, and we were all summarily tossed off the

12:15.052 --> 12:30.232
mission, and it apparently bothered Charlie so 
much that he moved to the University of Colorado,

12:15.052 --> 12:30.232
where he was my director for five years. That was 
probably it, my first one, but clearly when I

12:30.252 --> 12:39.004
became a NASA employee and a NASA...

12:39.777 --> 12:45.483
branch head and then a lab chief, it was a long 
interaction for about 20 years. And I will say, it

12:46.404 --> 12:52.751
was only towards the end that the cost-benefit 
ratio went strongly unfavorable. In the 60s, if

12:53.432 --> 13:00.099
you were in NASA and had good ideas and were willing 
to work hard, you could get really neat things

12:53.432 --> 13:00.099
done. Like we sold the SMM mission. Solar Maxwell 
mission. Yeah, sorry. so we sold that and i think

13:06.490 --> 13:30.658
it's been one of the most productive solar 
missions around and then we uh... done with that

13:06.490 --> 13:30.658
and we sold the goddard high resolution 
spectrograph and uh... we helped start the hally

13:06.490 --> 13:30.658
watch you know and you can go down the list but now 
generally speaking even if you have a good idea and

13:06.490 --> 13:30.658
you're willing to work hard it doesn't matter it's 
not going to happen anyways uh... in general Do you

13:30.925 --> 13:33.808
think NASA's handled planetary science good or 
bad? Or average? Well, let's start with the

13:38.332 --> 13:42.296
pluses, and then we'll try to draw a conclusion. 
It's done a lot. I mean, we've had missions to

13:44.539 --> 13:53.648
Mercury and Venus and Mars and Jupiter and Uranus, 
Saturn, Neptune. So, you know, it's hard to fault

13:53.668 --> 13:57.051
NASA The accomplishments, in my opinion, of the 
NASA planet missions, you know, missions to the

13:58.347 --> 14:03.552
moon, we've got rocks, you know, a whole bit. And 
Mars Observer's on its way. It doesn't have any

14:07.455 --> 14:09.537
significant problems that I know of. And 
Galileo's on its way. It does have a significant

14:10.719 --> 14:15.743
problem, but you can probably recoup a fair amount 
of that. I've heard a number of people say that NASA

14:15.763 --> 14:25.232
gets the pretty pictures and then cuts off the 
money before the data is really properly examined

14:15.763 --> 14:25.232
and published. Is that true? I think you can take 
two views of that, and then let's try to decide

14:26.904 --> 14:30.968
which is correct.

14:34.032 --> 14:50.308
Certainly that tendency, and especially under 
the new administrator, Daniel Golden, I think

14:34.032 --> 14:50.308
there is even more than normal an inclination to 
launch something and skim the cream and then

14:34.032 --> 14:50.308
declare victory and go home. The old NASA motto 
among the troops was build it, launch it, and

14:51.115 --> 14:55.722
forget it. And I'm afraid we're going back to that. 
Under the management that's been around for the

14:58.927 --> 15:14.811
last 10 years or so, largely involving people like 
Len Fisk, I think there was a tendency to

14:58.927 --> 15:14.811
understand that when you built something like 
this, that the risk part was in the building,

14:58.927 --> 15:14.811
testing, and launching. And that the mission 
part, so-called M-O-N-D-A in NASA parlance,

15:15.500 --> 15:27.044
mission operations and data analysis, is the good 
part, the cream skimming, the gravy. But

15:28.988 --> 15:31.694
regrettably, I think we're going back to that. So I 
think it is a real problem. The thought of turning

15:35.564 --> 15:45.055
off things like Magellan I think sets a precedent 
which I really don't even want to think about, but

15:35.564 --> 15:45.055
it is almost surely going to happen. So I would say 
that NASA, up until semi-recently, has improved

15:45.996 --> 16:04.677
in that area over the early days, but now they seem 
to be regressing backward into the old build,

15:45.996 --> 16:04.677
launch, and forget syndrome. Where do you think 
planetary astronomy would be today without NASA,

16:05.973 --> 16:12.303
without the money that NASA's put into it? We 
wouldn't even recognize it. You just, you know,

16:15.709 --> 16:22.860
we've gone places and seen things that we just 
absolutely could not do from Earth. We do a lot from

16:22.880 --> 16:33.077
Earth, but having a mix of ground-based and space 
and in situ and theory and all of the above, is the

16:33.479 --> 16:35.181
way you make progress. Do you feel that people at 
headquarters in the past and in the present really

16:35.262 --> 16:40.990
understand what the troops in the field are doing? 
Do they keep up with the science? I really don't

16:44.976 --> 16:47.019
know how to answer that. I deal mostly now in my 
astrophysical hat with Ed Weiler, who is very

16:48.120 --> 17:03.182
knowledgeable about what's going on, and in my 
planetary hat with Juergen Rahe, who I would say

16:48.120 --> 17:03.182
the same thing. But they are in an environment 
which is, I think, charitably fire drill

17:03.719 --> 17:10.889
oriented. And whether they can spend enough time 
to keep fully up to date, I don't know. But I think

17:15.815 --> 17:17.558
they make a very good effort. Whether the top... 
Remember, this is the discipline chief level. And

17:24.307 --> 17:29.974
these people invariably are or were active 
scientists. And I think they're... their ability

17:33.588 --> 17:37.193
to keep up with what's going on is relatively good. 
As you then go higher in the NASA hierarchy, where

17:37.714 --> 17:51.375
frankly most of the decisions are made, I think the 
organization tends to be out of touch with

17:37.714 --> 17:51.375
anything outside the beltway. 30 years ago there 
was just an American Astronomical Society. Now

17:56.462 --> 17:58.766
there are all these sub-societies. And the first 
one, I guess, was the Division for Planetary

17:58.966 --> 18:01.991
Science. Has that been a good thing or a bad thing 
for A, planetary astronomy, and B, astronomy in

18:03.018 --> 18:07.424
general? I am one of the last holdouts against the 
Planetary Division of Planetary Sciences. I only

18:16.216 --> 18:17.697
joined last year. I believe that the division does 
serve a useful purpose in bringing everybody

18:17.718 --> 18:30.915
together, and I now religiously go to the 
meetings, but I think it has also further helped to

18:31.283 --> 18:38.350
drive the wedge between the planetary community 
and the other community. They never did talk very

18:38.370 --> 18:40.833
much to each other. No, but this sort of makes it 
official.

18:48.181 --> 18:55.368
Thirty years ago, Icarus was an obscure journal 
publishing obscure papers by Bulgarians,

18:48.181 --> 18:55.368
Austrian mechanics, and you've got to give Carl 
Sagan credit. He really changed that around. Do

18:57.811 --> 19:01.336
you happen to know who wrote the first paper in 
Icarus? Well, you did. Yes, thank you. I'm talking

19:04.760 --> 19:07.043
about the majority of papers, all right? It turns 
out that paper was wrong, incidentally, which

19:07.364 --> 19:14.253
came to a shock to Joe Burns. Do you think the rise of 
Icarus has been a good thing? I mean, we don't see

19:18.459 --> 19:21.743
planetary papers in the APJ anymore, not that we 
saw a lot of them. Well, I still publish some of my

19:21.783 --> 19:25.388
planetary papers in APJ. and I published some in 
ICRIS, and I published some in AJA, and I plan to

19:26.060 --> 19:32.670
publish some in ANA. As I described earlier, a lot 
of this work I've been doing with DEs and the Halley

19:33.751 --> 19:40.621
data has all come to fruition, so there's a flock of 
papers coming out. ANA is? Astronomy and

19:41.322 --> 19:49.033
Astrophysics, the so-called European journal, 
which is about international or anything. I think

19:50.856 --> 19:54.902
ICRIS has been turned into a first-rate journal 
Whether or not those papers would have been

19:56.266 --> 20:03.035
published anywhere, somewhere else, I couldn't 
possibly tell you. Take this meeting now. Do you

20:04.938 --> 20:09.685
think the astronomers here, this is your personal 
opinion again, that they look down on planetary

20:04.938 --> 20:09.685
astronomy now? Is there a grudging acceptance? Is 
there a wholehearted acceptance? I honestly

20:12.529 --> 20:13.650
don't know. And that stems from not caring. Some 
may. I'm sure there's some that do. But so what?

20:21.221 --> 20:25.547
Here's a particular and a general question. The 
particular one is, what's the reaction you get

20:25.983 --> 20:32.452
from people you meet on the airplane when you tell 
them you're an astronomer? Oh, that's easy. When I

20:33.293 --> 20:34.775
tell them I'm an astronomer, it's wonderful. When 
I tell them I work on Hubble, it's not so wonderful.

20:39.040 --> 20:45.469
And for the first year or so after the spherical 
aberration was discovered, I did not volunteer

20:39.040 --> 20:45.469
that information. Things have, the general 
public perception has improved to the point where

20:46.009 --> 20:55.602
I can now volunteer it without risking, you know, 
three hours with the person next to you beating you

20:46.009 --> 20:55.602
over the head verbally. What do you think the 
public's general attitude towards planetary

20:56.307 --> 21:02.074
astronomy and astronomy in general? I think the 
public has fantastic support for the general

21:02.094 --> 21:15.629
mission of astronomy in general and of NASA in 
terms of exploration of space and orbiting

21:02.094 --> 21:15.629
observatories in particular. I find that it's the 
political process where the support tends to

21:16.891 --> 21:23.098
weaken. But I give lots of public talks. I 
personally figure I'm supported by public monies

21:27.257 --> 21:39.233
and giving talks on my comment work on Hubble and 
whatever else is part of the territory, and I find

21:27.257 --> 21:39.233
tremendous reception. Do you think planetary 
astronomers in particular and astronomers in

21:39.253 --> 21:46.863
general have done as good a job as they could in 
selling themselves to the public in Congress?

21:47.063 --> 21:48.044
Undoubtedly not. No question.

21:53.892 --> 21:54.613
On the other hand, Would you agree that there's 
probably more realization now that, you know,

21:54.847 --> 22:01.354
we're getting paid by the public and we've got to 
tell them? Is that true? Would you go along with

22:02.015 --> 22:05.679
that?

22:05.699 --> 22:07.221
I doubt that, actually. I think in some levels that 
is well perceived, but I continue to meet people

22:07.241 --> 22:16.111
who regard their intellectual inquiry almost as a 
divine right. Just give me the money and don't ask

22:16.912 --> 22:18.574
questions. Exactly. I'm smart. I'm uncovering 
the secrets of the universe. Send the check. How

22:24.732 --> 22:27.795
good a job have we done with the Congress? We've 
probably done even worse with the Congress. We

22:31.338 --> 22:46.911
tend, like almost all segments of U.S. society, to 
respond only to, at 1159 on a scale of 12 o'clock, to

22:31.338 --> 22:46.911
impending disasters. When something that's near 
and dear to our heart is about to be canceled, we

22:46.931 --> 22:54.418
spring into action, but we don't do the homework 
that would have prevented us from getting in that

22:54.702 --> 22:56.865
situation in the first place? Well, we haven't 
found life anywhere, any trace of evidence of life

22:58.968 --> 23:07.198
anywhere in the solar system except what we know it 
is on Earth. Do we? Well, we haven't found it yet.

23:09.882 --> 23:10.923
What's the evidence part? Make good beer. All 
right. Has that had any effect on funding and

23:15.049 --> 23:22.298
public interest, the fact that, for example, 
there are Martians?

23:22.318 --> 23:22.819
I doubt it. You know, these are, quote, finding of 
life, unquote, is such a long shot. I think most

23:31.309 --> 23:33.332
people understand what the odds are. A lot of 
people have gotten a lot of publicity and money, I

23:33.352 --> 23:46.275
guess, lately, pushing topics like killer 
asteroids, ozone holes, search for

23:33.352 --> 23:46.275
extraterrestrial intelligence, other solar 
systems. You think they're overdoing it?

23:52.786 --> 23:58.892
Let me just comment on the killer asteroid 
syndrome. Nothing that I personally know of

23:59.533 --> 24:04.578
that's being done there is bad science. In fact, 
there's a lot of good science there. And it's an

24:07.542 --> 24:09.283
area that I have some interest. I am trying to get 
modest funding to do searches for small comets. It

24:15.290 --> 24:21.156
turns out that really is a different problem if you 
read the space watch survey carefully. I believe,

24:22.790 --> 24:30.941
however, that Congress is funding it for what they 
believe to be the danger to Earth. And although

24:32.042 --> 24:36.688
there clearly is a danger to Earth, I think that is 
probably overblown. It probably won't do any harm

24:38.271 --> 24:40.173
either.

24:43.097 --> 24:48.424
What killed planetary, essentially killed 
planetary astronomy early in the century? Was it

24:48.444 --> 24:50.687
just Percival Lowell that we run out of? I really 
don't know the answer to that question. Partly the

24:56.252 --> 25:04.841
reason I don't like to put, first of all, don't 
know, but even if I thought I did, a lot of these

24:56.252 --> 25:04.841
things tend to go in cycles. And it's sort of like 
education, you know, we use phonics and then it's

25:06.663 --> 25:11.669
whatever and whatever and whatever. So I don't 
take short-term fluctuations too seriously, and

25:12.089 --> 25:20.218
I think under the last 20, 25 years with NASA and all 
the way direct missions that planetary astronomy

25:20.975 --> 25:28.627
may have gotten the lion's share of something, and 
if it goes back the other way, so what? What's the

25:30.990 --> 25:32.973
state of planetary astronomy today? Plus, minus, 
zero? I still think it's a plus.

25:40.144 --> 25:45.312
And keeping it a plus, in my view, depends on Three 
things. Continued vitality at the young

25:47.946 --> 25:51.751
investigator level. In other words, enough funds 
to keep a crop of fresh blood, fresh ideas coming

25:52.131 --> 26:01.464
into the field. The development, that's one. Two 
is the development of good ground-based

26:04.628 --> 26:10.956
capabilities for observations of planets. And 
the third is keeping a reasonable semblance of the

26:11.016 --> 26:16.243
space program going. Of the three, I worry most 
about the last one, number three. But they're all

26:21.737 --> 26:25.140
intertwined at a rather good level. And so even as 
we speak, again, we have Galileo and Mars

26:27.363 --> 26:33.329
Observer. And so my big question is, where is the 
next planetary mission coming from? Will it be the

26:38.755 --> 26:41.437
Discovery series? Will it be a larger mission? 
Whatever. In the last 30 years since NASI got into

26:47.223 --> 26:53.770
business, the taxpayers have spent a lot of money 
on planetary astronomy. What do you think they've

26:54.411 --> 26:56.673
gotten back from it? I think they've got a lot of 
excitement. I frankly think that that money,

26:59.957 --> 27:14.212
generally speaking, has been well spent and that 
enough has come of it that is straightforward and

26:59.957 --> 27:14.212
reasonably simple to understand. You don't need 
to be... a professional astronomer to look at an

27:17.902 --> 27:26.833
image of a planet at a new resolution or a new 
wavelength and see there's brand new stuff going

27:17.902 --> 27:26.833
on there. I find that, again, when I talk to people 
in a public-type, you know, the Kiwanis Club, ARP

27:27.954 --> 27:43.153
is one of my, they're desperate always for 
programs where I live, so they keep calling me up,

27:27.954 --> 27:43.153
that the people appreciate what is being done. I 
don't think that when people hear that the NASA

27:46.606 --> 27:51.658
budget is 1% of the federal budget, that they 
consider that . Most people think it's 10% or 15%,

27:53.703 --> 27:58.674
incidentally, which is not true. But again, 
perception is the problem here. Let's get a

28:02.738 --> 28:04.920
particular case now. The University of Colorado 
doesn't have any conservatory or anything.

28:10.945 --> 28:13.808
Again, I'm asking questions that you know I know 
some of the answers to. But how did space science

28:14.308 --> 28:18.892
and planetary astronomy get going at Colorado? 
Space science had a really long tradition

28:18.912 --> 28:31.463
starting right after World War II with what was 
then the physics department and people like Bill

28:18.912 --> 28:31.463
Rentsch. doing spectroscopy of first the sun and 
other solar system objects from rockets. And this

28:40.117 --> 28:49.452
has gone on through the years, and I think one of the 
other important things was Charlie Barth coming

28:40.117 --> 28:49.452
to the University of Colorado. It has then been 
formulated as a goal of the university to be one of

28:49.632 --> 28:58.125
the preeminent centers of space research in the 
country. So I think it started right after World

28:59.624 --> 29:05.010
War II with rockets, mostly launched from White 
Sands. And then it has developed into the more

29:06.111 --> 29:10.876
ambitious programs, the missions to planets. And 
one of the major OSO 8 experiments was at the

29:12.177 --> 29:22.168
University of Colorado.

29:25.091 --> 29:26.532
So I think that pretty much does it. Now, of course, 
we're a major. force in the industry. We have a

29:29.851 --> 29:32.855
major new building where we build the 
instruments. And one of our new instruments is one

29:34.377 --> 29:39.924
Larry Esposito is building for Cassini. Mission 
to Saturn. Study the rings and everything else. So

29:45.371 --> 29:47.313
he's standing pretty good with the 
administration. Not sure what that means. We win

29:50.838 --> 29:54.943
our share of the competitions, which is the way all 
these things are selected. And we have areas of

29:57.840 --> 30:05.972
world-recognized expertise, detectors, 
systems, et cetera. Just out of curiosity, what

30:07.935 --> 30:15.646
percentage of undergrad students are getting the 
exposure to astronomy? I can't, well, first you

30:15.666 --> 30:18.791
have to define that. There is an undergraduate, 
you know, astronomy one type course. And that has

30:22.796 --> 30:24.559
hundreds of people. So there's some fraction that 
way. For a long time, there was a satellite called

30:28.966 --> 30:43.968
SME, the Solar Mesospheric Explorer, where 
undergraduates could actually go in and learn how

30:28.966 --> 30:43.968
to operate a spacecraft. And for a long time, we 
were the only university that was operating their

30:44.649 --> 30:51.238
own spacecraft, and we did it. with the proper 
supervision, but literally with undergraduate

30:51.792 --> 30:55.276
students. And the University of Colorado has also 
had a fair number of people go on into the astronaut

30:56.197 --> 31:07.010
corps. Alan Shepard and there are others. I don't 
want to start down the list because I'll surely

31:11.435 --> 31:15.640
forget one, but there's a bunch. people are still 
churning out grad students in space sciences and

31:16.261 --> 31:22.951
planetary astronomy and regular astronomy. When 
is that going to stop or is it? Well, all economic

31:25.515 --> 31:28.259
systems are self-correcting. I try to be fairly 
candid with my students about what their job

31:29.301 --> 31:39.456
chances are and they're not, I tell them, they're 
not what they used to be. Some of these people have

31:41.479 --> 31:44.884
almost built in things like one of my Very best 
graduate students is from Korea. He wants to go

31:48.035 --> 31:49.336
back to Korea. He'll get a job in Korea because he 
has a prestigious education and all that kind of

31:49.857 --> 31:55.064
thing. But that's long ago. This was probably 20 
years ago when I was doing some teaching at the

31:58.148 --> 32:02.753
University of Maryland. While I was at Goddard, I 
had an adjoint professorship at Maryland. And

32:07.848 --> 32:14.240
Gart Westerhout used to give the incoming 
students a little sheet of paper that said, okay,

32:07.848 --> 32:14.240
here you are. We'll be happy to educate you, but you 
really ought to know that you might not get a job

32:14.280 --> 32:24.760
studying cosmology at Mount Wilson and Palomar 
Observatories. You might wind up teaching in a

32:27.187 --> 32:51.118
small college or working for ibm or csc or you know 
something like that i think a lot of people are

32:27.187 --> 32:51.118
being honest about it a lot of students students 
that are come into graduate school or an age

32:27.187 --> 32:51.118
they're not always amenable to that kind of advice 
and to put it mildly and you can't do anything about

32:27.187 --> 32:51.118
that but i believe if you're honest up front you're 
okay Do you think planetary astronomy is kind of

32:51.723 --> 32:55.933
mined out in regards to big discoveries? 
Nonsense. Professor Ari was not correct 100 years

32:59.942 --> 33:02.568
ago. No, it was not. Because that's something 
that... Several people have mentioned this.

33:08.633 --> 33:14.141
Well, you know, we now know what the backside of the 
moon looks like.

33:14.161 --> 33:15.463
But there's no evidence of it. I think that's a very 
basic lack of understanding of what intellectual

33:16.704 --> 33:23.755
inquiry and knowledge are all about. The day we, 
quote, know everything.

33:30.505 --> 33:34.510
Between the colliding superconductor and the 
space station, it's easy. Which one do you want?

33:36.340 --> 33:38.142
pick the super colliding superconductor. That's 
going to tell us something that we would actually

33:38.162 --> 33:46.152
like to know rather than have WPA for the man 
program or the people's program.

33:48.915 --> 33:52.119
What happened in planetary astronomy? Well, 
missions got more and more complex and more and

33:53.461 --> 34:00.930
more expensive, and I guess Viking was the 
ultimate one. And then what happened? Did the

34:02.384 --> 34:03.605
money just dry up? Or did people say, wait a minute, 
the next mission is going to cost the gross

34:03.725 --> 34:07.108
national product? Or what actually happened? 
Hard to say in detail, but due to human nature,

34:10.931 --> 34:19.899
everything tends to escalate in expense and 
complexity.

34:22.421 --> 34:28.627
Toyotas and Nissans or Datsuns, as they were then 
called 10 years ago, were at the low end of the

34:22.421 --> 34:28.627
curve. And they kept creeping up and creeping up in 
the same same human tendency works in missions and

34:31.555 --> 35:01.495
if a three or four hundred million dollar mission 
was great well how about a two billion one that one

34:31.555 --> 35:01.495
ought to be really fantastic and of course you 
reach some kind of law of diminishing returns

34:31.555 --> 35:01.495
where the increment in knowledge is not 
necessarily proportional to the increment in

34:31.555 --> 35:01.495
cost to put it as delicately as possible so that 
coupled with the fact that i am virtually sure that

35:03.517 --> 35:12.807
people in the NASA hierarchy are rewarded by the 
size of their missions or the amount of the budget

35:03.517 --> 35:12.807
that they control. You have a built-in escalation 
mechanism, and I think we see that in everything

35:13.768 --> 35:19.935
that we do. And partly it's a technological 
advance. We know how to do things better. We don't

35:24.300 --> 35:27.463
want to do it the same way we did it 15 or 20 years ago. 
And partially it's the tendency towards

35:28.144 --> 35:30.807
complexity and bureaucracy and all the other 
little nummies that we have come to love and know.

35:37.105 --> 35:41.752
Now let's go back to the late unpleasantness at the 
Yerkes Observatory. You may have been safely out

35:42.493 --> 35:50.765
of there, but I recall I spent a summer up there and 
people like you and Marnie Heiser were telling

35:42.493 --> 35:50.765
people, don't come here to grad school. We're 
stuck here. We've got to finish it out. And that

35:53.549 --> 35:58.617
place was, as far as I know, famous for its 
infighting and everything. And eventually it got

35:59.035 --> 36:02.699
Kuiper canned, so I understand. Is that true, do 
you know? It's true to the best of my knowledge that

36:04.400 --> 36:10.346
there was a revolt and a no-confidence vote and all 
that kind of thing. As a student there, I don't

36:11.267 --> 36:15.531
remember it quite as bad. I mean, we knew the 
fighting was going on, but it didn't actually

36:15.571 --> 36:22.938
affect us all that much in retrospect. And I am 
perfectly happy with the education that I got

36:22.958 --> 36:27.102
there. But there's no question it could get a 
little hairy. You left before Kuiper was ousted.

36:39.036 --> 36:44.763
No, Kuiper left between my third and fourth years 
there. Which would be? 1959.

36:49.008 --> 36:53.975
And that's when LPL was founded in Tucson. But when 
I left, Morgan was acting director. which was a fun

36:59.060 --> 37:00.982
thing in and of itself. But Corker had already 
gone. Actually, only a few people survived that

37:06.988 --> 37:12.073
three or four year period in there. Well, remember 
that when I first went there, Bengt Stromgren was

37:12.974 --> 37:16.498
director. And I don't know what happened to him. I 
don't know whether he was pushed or shoved. It

37:21.223 --> 37:21.804
doesn't matter. He said, fine, I'm going back to my 
professorship as Carlsberg professor at at the

37:28.034 --> 37:32.780
observatory in Denmark, which I now cannot 
remember the name of. It's a famous observatory.

37:35.043 --> 37:35.944
Yeah, it's in Copenhagen. Yeah, if any of us says 
the name, we'll know what it is. And I was told,

37:39.128 --> 37:50.684
don't have actual proof, but repeatedly told that 
the Carlsberg Brewery put major funding into

37:39.128 --> 37:50.684
there, which, hey, we can handle that. And then 
Kuiper was director for a year or two. I don't know

37:55.118 --> 37:58.202
whether it was one or two. I don't know, I don't 
remember whether Strump was one or two years in.

38:02.288 --> 38:04.591
Morgan was, I think, acting director the last 
year. I've heard from a number of people that there

38:05.252 --> 38:11.100
were a lot of people saying things like studying 
the solar system is a waste of time. We should be

38:11.640 --> 38:13.323
doing real astronomy. Well, there were a lot. In 
fairness, not only did Joe Chamberlain do solar

38:16.006 --> 38:22.375
system work, but so did Kuiper.

38:23.705 --> 38:26.088
Kuiper was a hell of a smart man. People tend to 
forget that because his personality was a little

38:26.108 --> 38:29.092
rough. But he was very innovative. His studies of 
what we now call the Kuiper-Duncan belt were 30, 35

38:35.600 --> 38:44.372
years, 40 years ahead of their time, whatever the 
number is. And I think it's a tendency to

38:45.353 --> 38:53.003
underestimate his abilities and contributions, 
which I think is wrong. Do you remember when Aiden

38:53.405 --> 38:56.669
Minel left? We had zero overlap at Yerkes, so I 
don't know when that was. And Joe Chamberlain? Joe

39:03.218 --> 39:18.838
Chamberlain was still at Yerkes when I left, and 
two years later, two and a half years later, he took

39:03.218 --> 39:18.838
the job as associate director of the space 
division at Kitt Peak, and I joined him at Kitt Peak

39:03.218 --> 39:18.838
for three years.
