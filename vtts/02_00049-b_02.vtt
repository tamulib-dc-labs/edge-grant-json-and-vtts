WEBVTT

00:02.039 --> 00:03.221
Didn't have Somerville. And I thought, gee, if 
we've got that east of town, and I didn't know

00:03.241 --> 00:11.892
whether any of that bottom land was any good or not, 
well, gee, that would be great. But it never came

00:12.693 --> 00:14.695
about. Who were Mr. Rudder's? Before I lose this 
thought, talking about lakes, he was all for Lake

00:17.399 --> 00:24.147
Somerville. And the honcho on that project was one 
Hub Baker from Somerville, Texas, and his brother

00:29.562 --> 00:30.703
Eddie. They were big heavy boys, big eaters. And 
they were nearly as close with LBJ as Mr. Rudder

00:37.371 --> 00:39.373
was. And they bought up the land around the AWOL 
there and then suggested maybe that a lake would be

00:39.393 --> 00:46.221
nice there. Well, it so happens that Overlook 
Marina, which he developed and owned, happened to

00:46.281 --> 00:53.288
be on the high prominence right next to the dam. And 
so strangely enough, that dam was built. And Hub

00:58.216 --> 01:01.879
Baker was right in the middle of the money part of 
it. And somehow Mr. Rutter knew Hub. And one day,

01:05.343 --> 01:16.233
when the dam had been built, they were going to have 
a gigantic opening celebration. And Lyndon

01:16.253 --> 01:21.097
Johnson was going to be a speaker, and Jake Pickle, 
and others. And I was in the office. And Hub called

01:24.861 --> 01:27.463
Earl Rutter and said, Earl, we're going to have 
this thing over here you know Johnson's behind it

01:27.747 --> 01:34.958
and we're behind it and all that and it's going to be 
a real bone to your school. People will have places

01:35.659 --> 01:39.224
to swim and fish and boat and ski. He said, we want 
the Aggie band. He said, Hub, when is this thing

01:42.669 --> 01:45.333
going to take place? And he said, June the 4th. And 
Mr. Rudder looked at me and he says, Edwin, is there

01:48.558 --> 01:52.544
an Aggie band on June the 4th? I said, no, sir, there 
is not. there is no Aggie band in the summer. And he

01:59.312 --> 02:02.355
reported that to Hub, and Hub just really got mad. 
And he said, well, you, he said, that's your part,

02:03.195 --> 02:06.138
Earl. He said, you got to have the music here. I 
don't care. If you can't have the Aggie band, you

02:08.960 --> 02:11.282
get something. And Mr. Rudder looked at me and 
said, Edwin, you are the music director for the

02:12.483 --> 02:17.007
grand opening of Lake Somerville. He said, you get 
over there and get with Hub Baker and get that old

02:17.027 --> 02:21.171
man off my back. And I went to about 15 meetings. And 
when the the celebration took place, I had the

02:25.038 --> 02:28.161
Glenn College Band. I had the A&M Consolidated 
Band, the Bryan High School Band, the Somerville

02:28.282 --> 02:34.128
Band, the Branham Band. We had six bands there. And 
LBJ didn't show up. And they had made such an

02:39.274 --> 02:49.905
elaborate grandstand according to Secret 
Service guidelines for the president. It was two

02:50.005 --> 02:51.687
stories high. And they had that thing built down 
there, according to the specs. And boy, they're

02:56.385 --> 02:58.607
just unbelievable specs. The one they were going 
to do for President Ford, I think, on Kyle Field,

02:59.668 --> 03:06.555
minimum cost $32,000 for the grandstand. I looked 
into that

03:06.716 --> 03:12.162
for graduation. But Hub, we went on with the 
celebration. And Jake Pickle was the main

03:17.307 --> 03:20.070
speaker. and hub had that grandstand hauled up on 
the hill behind his marina screened it in and had a

03:20.995 --> 03:45.096
two-story cabin for rent i think it's still over 
there can you remember any great frustrations mr

03:20.995 --> 03:45.096
rudder felt projects dreams he had that he wasn't 
able to bring to reality

03:49.396 --> 04:00.954
I think two of the things that were really tough to 
solve

03:49.396 --> 04:00.954
would have been the formation of Connolly Tech.

04:05.320 --> 04:10.608
Mr. Connolly said, Earl, do something with that 
place over there. He said, I'm going to make it part

04:10.629 --> 04:13.673
of A&M, legally. And you figure out what we can do 
over there. James Connolly Technical Institute.

04:20.495 --> 04:22.137
And they hired a guy named Roy Duggar. And they 
developed the program there. But how it fit in with

04:26.442 --> 04:32.530
A&M's mission was never, ever resolved. So I think 
that one was really frustrating because of his

04:32.550 --> 04:41.521
allegiance versus what in the hell are we going to 
do with a technical institute? And then the other

04:41.541 --> 04:46.167
one would have been A&M Galveston. I can't 
remember exactly when that started. I don't. But,

04:51.796 --> 05:01.868
you know, it's still

04:51.796 --> 05:01.868
a... Lots of vice presidents have really worried 
over that one. Who does it belong to? Is it a college

05:03.010 --> 05:05.373
or is it on its own? And those were two things that I 
know that he really worried about because he

05:06.494 --> 05:11.040
didn't He really, I think, a real frustration was 
there were those that wanted A&M to be all things to

05:12.944 --> 05:20.692
all people. And his feeling really truly was it's 
at College Station, Texas. Now, you left his staff

05:27.718 --> 05:31.562
in 67. In 67, I became director of civilian student 
activities. And his charge to me was simple. He

05:37.048 --> 05:39.610
said, I don't want to lose you in this office. But 
we're going to have all these civilian students.

05:42.418 --> 05:51.571
And I want you to go over there and study and think 
and talk and find out what we can do to give them a

05:42.418 --> 05:51.571
flagpole to rally around. And one of the first 
things I did was visit LSU, Penn State, Purdue, and

05:52.612 --> 06:03.788
VPI, which were land grant schools. I said, what do 
you do with non-core students? And we developed

06:07.312 --> 06:09.175
the resident hall program. And boy, it hit the fan 
when he found out that it was going to cost some

06:11.375 --> 06:15.721
money. But in my report to him, I showed him how we 
could finance it through student activity fees

06:16.342 --> 06:23.991
legally. And it wasn't really that much money. And 
I said, if you don't want to do it all at once, let's

06:26.775 --> 06:38.250
put names on those dormitories instead of 
numbers, instead of dorm. 16 let's make it Davis

06:38.939 --> 06:57.572
Gary Hall which put the name up that's the first 
thing and we did that and I said we'll get three

06:38.939 --> 06:57.572
pilot dormitories and we'll get one of each kind of 
dorm we have namely Leggett Walton and Davis Gary

06:58.109 --> 07:01.295
and see if it will work there and get the students to 
help. Set up a resident advisor program. Instead

07:03.199 --> 07:10.252
of one guy responsible for 250 yahoos, we'd have 
four or five student employees in there. And set up

07:10.893 --> 07:14.520
the first residence hall program. And I think not 
many people know that that was my baby. and uh and

07:21.650 --> 07:43.590
how it happened and so forth and uh to see it still 
alive now is something that i take pride in one of

07:21.650 --> 07:43.590
the things i wanted to give you is for the archives 
here's my report to president rutter on

07:21.650 --> 07:43.590
establishing the uh residence hall program this 
goes to the archive that goes to the world great

07:21.650 --> 07:43.590
that's the only And it has the financing and who we 
took up to Lake Buchanan and had a retreat,

07:44.026 --> 07:53.261
including Charles McCandless and Atlantis Hope. 
But there's how the whole thing got started right

07:54.363 --> 07:56.567
there. And that I have no more use for here. And that 
should be in the archives. All right. Just a couple

08:02.998 --> 08:04.821
of things before we break for lunch. We now know 
when Mr. Rudder died. Were you, as a person that

08:10.030 --> 08:18.820
worked with him closely, were you aware of any 
declining health on his part not long before his

08:10.030 --> 08:18.820
attack? At the moment of his attack was the second 
time that I had resigned from the university. I did

08:25.388 --> 08:31.034
it twice, once before coming to his office and once 
after doing this work. I was frustrated about the

08:31.995 --> 08:39.784
future and a lot of things, and I again left. And 
while I was gone, I was with the American Oil

08:40.287 --> 08:44.372
Company in Bryan. And when he had all that problem, 
I was not on campus. And then Mr. Heaton was made

08:48.496 --> 09:00.370
dean, and they wanted a director of admissions, 
and that's when I came back. And that's after Mr.

09:00.610 --> 09:01.832
Heaton. That's after. And I have a real fine letter 
from Frank Hubert and one from Horace Byers.

09:09.464 --> 09:17.395
thanking me for helping with, even though I didn't 
work there any longer, helping with certain

09:09.464 --> 09:17.395
aspects of the funeral service. Dick Bernard was 
his assistant at that time. All right. Summarize

09:21.480 --> 09:28.950
your feelings about Earl Rudder.

09:28.970 --> 09:38.543
If you would allow me, I would say if you put the two 
together of Jack Williams and Earl Rudder, two

09:28.970 --> 09:38.543
very different types of personalities, we have in 
that combination

09:42.269 --> 09:47.274
I think maybe a gift from heaven in the two of them. 
One, finishing, in a sense, what the other one

09:47.474 --> 09:53.399
started and knowing how to do it. The academic part 
that was a frustration to Mr. Rutter, Williams

09:54.300 --> 09:58.704
knew. But he was hard-headed, stubborn, sweet, 
mean.

10:11.328 --> 10:26.603
could be sarcastic, but was probably the single 
most important man in the history of the school

10:11.328 --> 10:26.603
based on what he visioned and having the good sense 
to go to academic type people and say, where should

10:11.328 --> 10:26.603
we be? Knowing that he couldn't do that himself, he 
went to people that could. So with the action he

10:32.109 --> 10:36.373
started, his willingness to go into the changes, 
the dramatic changes of the 60s, his willingness

10:37.028 --> 10:47.061
to go along and support it, though it wasn't really 
the way he wanted it, shows the bigness of the man.

10:47.762 --> 10:53.390
And he had the background and the friends out there 
to get the job done any day. I'm sure he did

10:53.410 --> 10:57.375
it. Let's chat now about Jack Kenny Williams. You 
had, in 67, gone over to admissions. Yeah,

11:08.381 --> 11:11.303
director of admissions. And so let's cover that. 
Did you follow Mr. Heaton immediately? Yes. And

11:19.370 --> 11:21.152
now, wait a minute. Let's see.

11:24.555 --> 11:25.916
I was director of admissions. Mr. Heaton was dean. 
Oh, OK. So when you go. Williams came in, and

11:31.147 --> 11:42.766
Williams asked Buckwires who a person would be 
that would be a good assistant for him. He

11:43.227 --> 11:49.458
recommended me, and I went over there, leaving 
director of admissions position. And Mr. Heaton

11:50.079 --> 11:54.346
said he was the only person in the world that ever 
called me Eddie. Nobody has ever called me Eddie.

11:57.539 --> 12:02.968
He says, Eddie, I just want you to find a person to 
take your place, someone as good as you've been. I

12:03.649 --> 12:04.310
said, OK. So I somehow made contact with Billie 
Jean Lay. And it worked out just beautifully. Bill

12:12.463 --> 12:15.167
made a fine director of admissions. And then I 
served two years. And then Mr. Heaton retired. And

12:21.497 --> 12:25.183
I think you were probably helpful with me getting 
into that position. And so I left the president's

12:25.703 --> 12:29.048
office and became dean of admissions. Let's go 
back, though, when you first went over to work with

12:29.649 --> 12:35.578
Mr. Heaton. What was the search process, as far as 
you know? You mean for me to? Yeah, how did? The

12:42.768 --> 12:45.973
search process was Bob Lacey saying to Mr. Heaton, 
We sure miss old Cooper here on campus. We need to

12:48.908 --> 12:50.550
get him back. And Mr. Heath says, would you go talk 
with Eddie and see if he? Well, I was dying for a job

12:53.614 --> 12:56.798
on campus. And that just worked perfectly. So I'm 
sure that Bob Lacy is the one. I think he said

13:03.467 --> 13:06.711
something like, don't hire anybody but Cooper. 
That's what he said. Describe this man. How long

13:09.815 --> 13:11.918
had he been there? What was he like? He had been 
there since 1936.

13:18.067 --> 13:32.042
And he was the most conservative,

13:18.067 --> 13:32.042
gentlemanly type of man that I have ever known. 
Deep East Texas, from a big family.

13:40.011 --> 13:42.454
Dressed to the T, I'll never forget taking some 
catalogs to him on a Saturday morning. He was

13:45.718 --> 13:55.773
mowing the grass and had on a long-sleeved white 
shirt and a tie tucked in between the buttons while

13:45.718 --> 13:55.773
he was mowing.

13:57.395 --> 14:03.544
He

13:57.395 --> 14:03.544
worried about everything. He worried about the 
women wearing slacks while at work. until someone

14:10.733 --> 14:20.444
pointed out to him that when they bent over in a 
skirt to open the lower file cabinet that actually

14:10.733 --> 14:20.444
a lot of flesh was exposed. And at that point, he 
agreed, well, maybe they should be allowed to wear

14:20.524 --> 14:25.749
slacks at work.

14:29.013 --> 14:37.382
He was of the old school that felt that it would be 
terrifying to let this place grow too rapidly. And

14:38.003 --> 14:47.236
he took a great pride in reporting to the president 
that it would look like we probably are going to be

14:38.003 --> 14:47.236
up 100 to 150 students this year. And that just 
tickled him to death. The part about girls coming

14:49.540 --> 15:03.640
in, he was so alarmed about that that it took three 
years for him to agree to finally put something in

14:49.540 --> 15:03.640
the catalog that wives of, well, That never was put 
in there, I don't think. And finally, after the

15:05.821 --> 15:11.089
third year, they said all students were admitted 
equally. And he was under great suspect of any

15:12.191 --> 15:17.599
faculty wife, for example, that came in. He just 
formed a moral judgment on each one of them. And he

15:22.887 --> 15:31.821
stayed awake at night worrying about somebody 
fooling him about whether or not they really were

15:22.887 --> 15:31.821
eligible to be admitted. set him back and he was 
generally opposed to international students and

15:32.442 --> 15:41.916
did everything he could really to make them 
unwelcome. And you had a lot of leeway there

15:43.378 --> 15:47.525
because it's a judgment call. From one country, a 
grade of 10 on a transcript is excellent. On

15:52.752 --> 15:56.498
another, that's about as low as you can get and who 
is to argue with it? Not many people know how to

15:57.159 --> 15:59.142
argue with that. He was ultra-conservative about 
staff people, wanted to work with as few as humanly

15:59.830 --> 16:09.345
possible. The admissions people were always 
overworked. They'd stay up there until 7 or 8

16:12.831 --> 16:21.124
o'clock at night trying to keep up with the 
applications once coeducation came along and so

16:12.831 --> 16:21.124
forth. And the foreign students, when I went in 
there, nobody really was in charge. And there's an

16:27.472 --> 16:31.139
interesting story, sideline there. Jack 
Williams called me down one day and he said, do you

16:32.060 --> 16:40.155
believe in honoring commitments that other 
people have made? I said, generally, yes. He said,

16:42.900 --> 16:48.130
well, L.F. Peterson told Lloyd Taylor that if he 
went to Tarleton and was athletic director and

16:49.207 --> 17:04.005
coach there and it worked and they got a big program 
going and people actually paying to see football

16:49.207 --> 17:04.005
games, that that would be a great service for the NM 
system. And it worked out where Jesus himself

17:04.025 --> 17:12.315
could not have gotten a first-class football 
program at Tarleton. And it cost Lloyd most of his

17:12.335 --> 17:18.943
stomach in turmoil and what do you call a stomach 
problem?

17:22.214 --> 17:26.398
the ailment that you get when your stomach is 
ulcerated and so forth. At any rate, they removed

17:26.959 --> 17:29.721
most of his stomach. And that didn't work. So he 
called through his own little way to find out if Mr.

17:32.084 --> 17:44.036
Peterson's promise that he could always come back 
to A&M, if anybody was going to uphold that, though

17:32.084 --> 17:44.036
Mr. Peterson was gone. And Williams explained all 
of that to me. And he said, did you know all that? And

17:50.242 --> 17:51.563
I said, no, sir, I did not. And he said, well, I'm 
going to honor the promise that was made in good

17:53.112 --> 18:00.342
faith. He said, is there some way that you could 
work him into a spot in your organization where he

18:00.362 --> 18:07.311
would do good work? I said, you bet. So we met at the 
circle at the elite cafe in downtown Waco. And I

18:15.067 --> 18:21.314
said, Lloyd, would you be interested in taking 
over the admission of international students? I

18:21.394 --> 18:22.575
need some strength there. And he agreed to and did a 
fine job and offered to take three or four Iranians

18:23.136 --> 18:34.568
out into the hallway and settle matters bare 
knuckles if that's what they really wanted. And

18:34.588 --> 18:38.912
the word got out pretty well that you don't fool Mr. 
Taylor. So I deviated, but that was it. In all of

18:41.816 --> 18:44.078
your years where you were responsible at whatever 
level for admissions. Was it common for some

18:51.675 --> 19:04.873
higher administrator to let you know that a 
certain student was to be admitted regardless of

18:51.675 --> 19:04.873
their qualifications? I don't think I ever had a 
president or a vice president say to me, Or Bob

19:10.147 --> 19:18.035
Cherry is the one that had the most calls because 
the regents, I used to get mad at him, but that

19:10.147 --> 19:18.035
wasn't fair because they put it on him. I finally 
had an agreement even with Bob Cherry. I said, when

19:22.781 --> 19:36.415
you get under pressure like that, kind of stall a 
little bit and then let me come back to you and tell

19:22.781 --> 19:36.415
you after we study this case whether we think the 
child has a chance to stay until Halloween. That

19:37.877 --> 19:39.158
was the date I used. I said, now I'm going to tell you 
what I think, but I understand the pressure you're

19:40.133 --> 19:51.704
under, and we might have to swallow this one, but 
I'm going to tell you what I think. And do you know

19:51.724 --> 20:04.136
that most of the time he'd go back and say to Royce or 
whoever it was, Cooper says, I don't think that

19:51.724 --> 20:04.136
child is going to last until Halloween because 
XXX. And nine out of ten times he'd say, well,

20:05.537 --> 20:07.879
forget it. So I can't say I had a, but I did have a lot 
of pressure on the first grievous error I ever made

20:09.833 --> 20:28.499
that I will admit, and that is getting housing on 
campus for students who were not entitled to it.

20:29.020 --> 20:34.989
And I got the reputation for being able to do that, 
and it came down on me like bricks. Housing was the

20:36.791 --> 20:38.153
biggest issue. problem I faced in terms of tying it 
in with admission. They would say things like, how

20:43.662 --> 20:50.892
can you admit my granddaughter and then tell her 
that she has to live in Bryan? How can you do that?

20:52.775 --> 20:53.896
That was the toughest thing. And the president's 
office even said, OK, no more exceptions on

20:54.597 --> 21:01.127
housing. If you get them, you just let us know and 
we'll decide. And that didn't work. Because that

21:08.035 --> 21:12.883
put the president's office in a very, very awkward 
situation. And they found out very quickly that

21:12.943 --> 21:18.271
it's not an easy thing to manage. Veterinary 
admissions were not your worry. That's correct.

21:22.578 --> 21:23.559
Nor medical school. Nor medical school. And the 
other majors. And the graduate students, of

21:27.766 --> 21:29.328
course. We processed, Ms. Dean processed it. But 
the department and deans made the decisions. And

21:36.079 --> 21:44.469
be it architecture, engineering, or whatever, 
those were decided internally once the student

21:36.079 --> 21:44.469
was in the institution. So you didn't have to worry 
much with those. That's right.

21:50.936 --> 21:51.577
Let's see. During those years that you were over 
there either the first or second time, who were the

21:57.293 --> 22:26.035
key people in the area of registrar the registrars 
and director admissions areas

21:57.293 --> 22:26.035
just one minute i can i've got that here for you

21:57.293 --> 22:26.035
born around the world when that one died

22:30.520 --> 22:48.943
Remember

22:30.520 --> 22:48.943
when I got you to make that speech? We had dinner at 
your house. I'll be over there.

23:01.688 --> 23:06.395
Art, describe these people and their 
characteristics. Bob Lacy. Bob Lacy was, above

23:08.718 --> 23:17.610
all other things, loyal.

23:20.975 --> 23:30.548
And when it came time to look at computerized 
registration, we were way ahead of most schools.

23:31.287 --> 23:42.985
And he went to places like Purdue and BYU and 
learned the system and came back all excited. And

23:43.025 --> 23:49.615
he said, he always called me Dean Cooper, though we 
were very close friends. He said, within a year or

23:49.635 --> 23:55.504
two, there will not be a paper in this office. 
Everything will be on computer. And I said, Bob?

24:02.658 --> 24:04.781
Not as long as I have this job. I said, we can 
register on computer, but I want you to know that as

24:05.823 --> 24:17.480
long as I'm here, there will be a piece of cardboard 
down in the basement with the grades recorded on

24:05.823 --> 24:17.480
it. We're going to have a paper backup and I don't 
want somebody coming in and saying the system is

24:17.620 --> 24:24.650
out and it ate everything in there. I'm not going to 
do that. So I think it's still that way, but Bob

24:27.595 --> 24:32.462
Lacey would do anything within reason. And yet he 
would put up good arguments. And I could say, now,

24:35.218 --> 24:38.862
Bob, you're right. We shouldn't do this. But let me 
tell you the spot I'm in. And this vice president or

24:44.769 --> 24:50.095
this former student has asked us if we would do 
this. And I'm telling you, for the long run, I think

24:50.936 --> 24:53.820
we better do it. OK, that's the answer. And then he 
would go to Don Carter under him and tell Don to do

24:56.823 --> 25:01.909
it. And Don would go through a swamp of alligators 
with .50 calibers overhead and just say, which way

25:02.885 --> 25:13.376
are we supposed to go? Rough as he could be in many 
ways around the edges, Don Carter is probably the

25:14.478 --> 25:23.868
most dedicated guy that I've ever had working for 
me. He could make people mad because he was

25:23.888 --> 25:31.356
brusque, but he would do whatever you asked him to 
do. Once he decided that that's the way it was going

25:31.792 --> 25:36.118
to be, then he'd start fussing. And he grew up in a 
big urban city named Splendora. Splendora, where

25:39.362 --> 25:44.688
the most exciting day of the year was the opening 
day of squirrel season. So he could go out and hunt

25:44.708 --> 25:47.192
his beloved limb rats. Now, let's see, and Miss 
Mitchell. Miss Mitchell was a study unto herself.

25:56.704 --> 25:59.267
She minced no words. was so dedicated that one day 
when she collapsed on the floor by her desk and had

26:01.222 --> 26:28.832
an intestinal ailment, flu of some sort that 
caused her to collapse, we sent across, we were in

26:01.222 --> 26:28.832
Heaton Hall and got the, Pat, I think was his last 
name, one of the administrators to come over and he

26:01.222 --> 26:28.832
gave her a shot and she started feeling a little 
better but still couldn't get up. reached up onto

26:28.913 --> 26:43.256
the desk and pulled a stack of transfer 
applications to the floor with her and continued

26:28.913 --> 26:43.256
her business until noon on the floor with a red 
pencil. The most dedicated human I've ever seen,

26:43.276 --> 26:55.495
but did it by the step, piece by piece, course by 
course, and if it took 40 hours, that's what she

26:43.276 --> 26:55.495
did. Now, she worked her entire adult life, didn't 
she, for you? She was born on the NM campus in one of

26:59.775 --> 27:02.881
the old faculty houses. Her husband was in the math 
department and bought up some property, and she

27:03.421 --> 27:12.416
was well-fixed all of her life. And she just loved 
that work, and she knew transfer admissions

27:12.476 --> 27:19.728
better than anybody in Texas, without question. 
And I believe that... And could make people mad. I

27:22.829 --> 27:26.653
believe the sale of her estate possessions is 
tomorrow. Yeah, right. I think there is one. Her

27:32.419 --> 27:35.643
mouth would get her in trouble once in a while. She 
could be so blunt. Some little girl, I said, please

27:39.047 --> 27:42.531
help this young lady. Dr. Williams has called 
about her, and she is a house guest at the Williams

27:44.012 --> 27:52.161
right now, and I'd like for you to put hers on top of 
the stack. And then she said to the little girl

27:52.681 --> 28:02.034
something like, well, I guess you know you 
wouldn't be here if you weren't the president's

27:52.681 --> 28:02.034
pet or something like that. And Jack Williams came 
over to my office and broke through the door

28:02.054 --> 28:06.841
without knocking. He says, who is Caroline 
Mitchell? I said, Dr. Williams, you don't want to

28:11.347 --> 28:14.652
know. I said, tell me what you want me to do and I will 
do it. So we got an apology. All right, let's go to

28:22.381 --> 28:24.924
Williams. You were not part of his staff 
immediately. When did you first interact with

28:30.592 --> 28:32.815
him? What was your first impression?

28:41.127 --> 28:47.576
He brought a word of greetings to the faculty at, 
what function was it at G. Raleigh White? Was it a,

28:49.318 --> 28:52.202
what function was it? Was it, could it have been the 
Faculty Achievements Award? No, that would have

28:57.117 --> 28:58.979
been too late. Because he began November 1, 1970. 
Mr. Rutter died in March. And Williams is here

29:05.747 --> 29:07.809
November 1, 1970. And I came very quickly, became 
his assistant. And that's what I was when I went to

29:13.536 --> 29:16.079
this program. And he told his famous joke about the 
bricklayer that kept going up and down. Yes, yes. I

29:22.996 --> 29:30.406
thought, what a delightful human being in terms of 
holding an audience totally in his grasp. And he

29:30.466 --> 29:34.952
said just the right things to the academic group 
that was there. And I said, we're off and running.

29:37.675 --> 29:39.217
We've got a sure enough winner here. And of course, 
that position solidified. The thing that I

29:43.203 --> 29:50.252
learned about him

29:43.203 --> 29:50.252
is that he was really temperamental. but was able 
generally to hold his tongue until he was out in the

29:51.177 --> 29:57.305
hallway. But one, for example, I had to meet him at 
the regent's headquarters in their new quarters

29:57.365 --> 30:14.827
one time to go from there somewhere else as soon as 
he got out of that session, closed session. And we

30:16.549 --> 30:19.733
got outside the building, and he was livid. And he 
never did tell me what they did or said that upset

30:19.882 --> 30:25.977
him so badly. But his only comments to me, he was 
really, really as mad as I've ever seen him. And he

30:34.867 --> 30:41.033
said, do you know the difference between Texas A&M 
and the University of Hell? I said, what is it? He

30:42.274 --> 30:48.681
says, they have two sets of regents at the 
University of Hell. But his patience would wear

30:48.701 --> 30:54.026
thin when he was under pressure. And he had people 
like me that he could explode in front of and vent

30:55.047 --> 31:02.595
some of the anger that he had. He got a letter that 
was about eight pages long from a local minister

31:03.740 --> 31:14.730
who had read in the battalion that the university 
was cutting down all the greenery on campus. What

31:15.290 --> 31:24.038
they were doing was moving some old hedges out of 
the way at a stop sign by the YMCA so you could see

31:15.290 --> 31:24.038
oncoming traffic. But the kids at the bat saw this 
machine digging out this plant. They assumed that

31:29.182 --> 31:32.565
we were just going to take out all the trees, and 
that's the way This guy read it in the battalion

31:33.085 --> 31:37.133
that we were doing away with all green space on 
campus. And this preacher wrote about an

31:37.974 --> 31:42.603
eight-page letter fighting mad. And Dr. Williams 
waited about three days to answer it.
