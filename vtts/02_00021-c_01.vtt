WEBVTT

00:02.427 --> 00:13.321
to be sure that it's working, preparing for an interview with Bill Barzak this afternoon.

00:13.341 --> 00:17.246
This is October 4th.

00:18.087 --> 00:30.342
We're in the Evans Library looking out on a slightly hazy morning, and I have the pleasant opportunity to interview Bobby Beiser.

00:30.440 --> 00:33.043
about his student experiences here.

00:33.824 --> 00:37.309
Bobby, now say a sentence so we'll test the mic.

00:38.370 --> 00:40.493
Bobby Beiser, Texas A&M University.

00:40.753 --> 00:41.174
How's that?

00:41.474 --> 00:41.955
That's good.

00:42.215 --> 00:45.299
Okay.

00:45.319 --> 00:55.311
Bobby, to introduce yourself to this recording, would you describe your background and experience before you came here as a student?

00:55.331 --> 00:56.633
Where did you grow up?

00:56.815 --> 01:00.043
How long had your family been there?

01:00.163 --> 01:03.531
Any special experiences you had before coming here?

01:03.952 --> 01:04.273
Sure.

01:05.656 --> 01:06.979
Actually, I'm a native Bryanite.

01:07.501 --> 01:10.167
I grew up and was raised in Bryan.

01:10.501 --> 01:14.384
I went to elementary school or public schools in Bryan.

01:15.045 --> 01:25.715
And so Texas A&M was always Texas A&M and had family attend here.

01:25.735 --> 01:33.362
In fact, my aunt was one of the first African-American females to attend.

01:33.382 --> 01:36.224
She attended the summer of 63.

01:37.285 --> 01:40.508
And I've had also an uncle.

01:40.488 --> 01:44.355
who attended and actually did his bachelor's degree here.

01:45.257 --> 01:48.864
And so I'd always had a desire to come to Texas A&M.

01:50.046 --> 01:53.773
Already you have my excitement in high gear.

01:54.695 --> 01:59.003
Your aunt was here in 63, so that was the first summer

01:59.827 --> 02:00.128
Right.

02:00.188 --> 02:01.673
Of any integration.

02:01.693 --> 02:01.933
Right.

02:02.515 --> 02:04.140
So does she still live here?

02:04.581 --> 02:14.190
She passed away about a year ago, about a couple years ago now, and so did not really realize

02:14.440 --> 02:22.273
Just learning here recently about the history surrounding her coming to Texas A&M, it's pretty interesting.

02:22.573 --> 02:38.760
And largely, again, General Rutter made a decision about integrating and wanted to start by identifying African Americans in the community who were interested in Texas A&M, and she was actually enrolled at Prairie View.

02:38.740 --> 02:46.557
and was recruited to come for that summer, that very first critical summer.

02:46.577 --> 02:50.245
Let's divert on her and anything you've heard her say.

02:51.789 --> 02:54.555
Do you know who helped identify her?

02:55.531 --> 02:57.815
We're not for certain.

02:59.418 --> 03:06.631
She was very much involved as a high school senior at what I guess would have been Kemp High School.

03:07.533 --> 03:16.189
So very much involved, an honor student there, and our family has had a history of being involved.

03:16.169 --> 03:37.760
I'd like to believe that particularly because my family was involved in the integration of the local school district, Bryan ISD, that my uncle Dolly Beiser was a great influence and a part of the discussions about integrating the campus.

03:38.040 --> 03:41.365
I could not imagine that happening without him.

03:41.385 --> 03:42.126
What was her name?

03:42.393 --> 03:43.414
Barbara Beiser.

03:43.654 --> 03:44.315
Barbara?

03:44.335 --> 03:44.475
Mm-hmm.

03:44.495 --> 03:48.259
And she came as what year was she in school?

03:48.279 --> 03:55.167
I believe she was, I believe it was her junior year at, let's see, would have been 63.

03:55.948 --> 04:00.933
No, actually it would have been her, likely been her freshman year at Prairie View.

04:00.993 --> 04:07.360
So it was either the summer before she left to go to Prairie View or the summer following her first year at Prairie View.

04:07.380 --> 04:08.721
And she was here only that summer?

04:08.741 --> 04:09.362
Only that summer.

04:10.085 --> 04:14.442
do you remember anything she said about her summer plus or minus?

04:14.962 --> 04:16.083
Not really.

04:16.143 --> 04:19.587
I don't remember her talking about it a great deal.

04:19.647 --> 04:28.936
She just would say, you know, as I was trying to make up my mind about where I wanted to go, she encouraged me to go because she thought it was a good program.

04:30.197 --> 04:33.781
But I don't think it was the right program for her at that right time.

04:33.821 --> 04:43.551
I think the atmosphere and obviously at Purview was, I think, a better environment for her at that time.

04:44.476 --> 04:46.638
I was part of the Aspirations Committee.

04:46.699 --> 04:47.640
I was the secretary.

04:48.541 --> 05:01.415
So I'm the one that wrote that report that recommended those comparatively important changes, integration, co-education, non-compulsory core, changing the admission requirements.

05:01.435 --> 05:11.867
And Mr. Rudder handled integration, well, he handled it all well, but he handled integration superbly because it was done for the first time in the summer.

05:12.269 --> 05:24.055
And therefore, when fall came and some student group might have, if they'd wanted to, tried to organize, say it wouldn't work, it already had worked splendidly all summer, and so there were no problem.

05:24.075 --> 05:25.799
All right, so you graduated from high school in what year?

05:26.119 --> 05:26.320
1982.

05:26.340 --> 05:26.560
82.

05:26.660 --> 05:28.424
From Bryan High School.

05:28.444 --> 05:29.687
From Bryan High School.

05:30.089 --> 05:33.537
And I don't need to ask you, when did you first visit the campus?

05:33.557 --> 05:35.541
Because you don't remember, you were probably so young.

05:35.762 --> 05:36.243
Ah, very.

05:37.145 --> 05:43.699
In fact, we would quite often come to campus for football games, so our athletic events.

05:43.719 --> 05:47.608
And so that was the initial introduction, and then a little

05:47.588 --> 05:54.418
A little later on, obviously, the academics became of interest to me here.

05:54.498 --> 06:10.161
And having been in Bryan Public Schools, a large portion of the student body, the college-going students from Bryan and Consolidated decide to come here to Texas A&M.

06:11.463 --> 06:13.967
And so that's the fall of what?

06:14.470 --> 06:15.833
That would have been a fall of 82.

06:15.853 --> 06:16.655
82.

06:18.459 --> 06:22.008
And you applied.

06:22.469 --> 06:26.438
Were there any difficulties in admission or anything like that that you recall?

06:26.570 --> 06:27.311
No, not at all.

06:27.771 --> 06:41.367
I was somewhat, though, amazed that there was not a big recruitment effort on camp and the local community.

06:41.827 --> 06:42.528
Not just for me.

06:43.089 --> 06:51.919
It seemed like the recruiting effort was largely focused on those students that may have been National Merit Scholars, but there were others of us who were good students

06:51.899 --> 06:56.666
who we were not actively recruited as we were by other universities.

06:57.467 --> 07:12.928
I recall, as I was trying to make up my mind about what I wanted to do, I recall getting a scholarship application from my counselor and she just sent me a note and sent this to one of my classrooms, I guess my homeroom,

07:12.908 --> 07:16.692
And it just said, complete it and return it to me.

07:16.712 --> 07:24.160
And I was like, well, I thought it was a commitment to A&M, and I did not know whether I wanted to commit to A&M.

07:24.180 --> 07:26.863
I had, well, I wanted to come here.

07:27.344 --> 07:33.150
I also had this burning desire to go to a historically black college.

07:33.350 --> 07:36.013
I was particularly interested in going to Morehouse.

07:35.993 --> 07:44.856
because of Morehouse's rich history of, you know, civil rights leaders attending there and

07:46.507 --> 07:47.949
And so I was kind of excited about that.

07:47.969 --> 07:50.874
And then I thought, well, this is a commitment that I'm not willing to make yet.

07:50.934 --> 07:53.779
And so I just, I didn't fill out the application.

07:53.799 --> 07:57.344
It was for the Presidential Achievement Scholarship Program.

07:57.845 --> 07:58.727
And I didn't fill it out.

07:59.548 --> 08:09.163
And that turned out to be it was okay, because fortunately I lived at home and we could afford for me to go and I could work and able to get some loans.

08:09.244 --> 08:13.290
And between all of that, then I was able to pay my way through school.

08:13.270 --> 08:25.546
I just found it interesting that there was not a recruiting, there was not a great deal of recruiting happening in the high schools, local high schools.

08:28.409 --> 08:31.594
So your first fall, you took a full-time load.

08:33.756 --> 08:38.923
What was the routine for advice and counseling on what courses to take?

08:39.359 --> 08:52.255
Oh man, I did not actually, I don't remember, I think I pretty much figured it out myself, except

08:53.973 --> 09:04.866
I did get into trouble academically and then sought out help when I decided I was going to be a liberal arts major.

09:04.886 --> 09:15.559
And I remember the person that I came into contact with there was Mary Broussard, who was, I believe she was director of the counselor, the academic advisors for the college for liberal arts.

09:15.539 --> 09:18.764
And really, that got me back on track.

09:18.824 --> 09:30.602
I came to A&M with very poor study skills, but I was an honor society student, and Brian Hyde, but I had poor study skills.

09:30.942 --> 09:43.842
And so they started, I mean, she talked to me about taking classes that would actually help me with my study skills, which would prepare me to be much more competitive in the classroom a little later on.

09:43.822 --> 09:44.864
and so that was helpful.

09:45.264 --> 09:48.089
Also got some help from upperclassmen.

09:48.990 --> 10:03.433
One person in particular who I believe was a junior and she asked me, she happened to see me in the student center and asked me, we started talking, introduced ourselves, an African-American

10:03.413 --> 10:14.043
female out from Silsby, Texas, and Karen Wright, and Karen asked me what classes was I taking, and I told her what I was taking, and she said, why are you taking biology 113?

10:14.103 --> 10:15.246
Are you a pre-med major?

10:15.766 --> 10:18.850
And I said, no, I thought about being a pre-med major, but I'm not a pre-med major.

10:18.870 --> 10:20.813
And she said, do you understand that?

10:20.953 --> 10:23.557
She said, what is it with you underclassmen?

10:23.577 --> 10:28.964
You don't ask the upperclassmen about what, you don't come to us for advice, and I'm here to help you.

10:29.505 --> 10:35.633
And so I said, well, I've got this big exam in biology 113, and I'm just, I'm really terrified about it.

10:35.673 --> 10:37.656
And so she said, well, tell you what, I've taken it.

10:37.771 --> 10:39.374
We're going back to my residence.

10:39.394 --> 10:45.804
We're going back to my dorm room, and we're going to get you those notes because I've saved them, and we're going to go to the library.

10:47.326 --> 10:49.249
And so she brought me over to the library.

10:49.390 --> 11:00.628
We picked up another underclassman who was taking another course that she had taken, and she brought us over to the library and sat with us, and the three of us just basically studied for this exam.

11:01.229 --> 11:02.972
And she was just an acquaintance?

11:03.072 --> 11:03.913
Just an acquaintance.

11:04.619 --> 11:09.812
Let's see, when you started out, what was your major gonna be?

11:10.393 --> 11:19.455
I originally started out, my major was gonna be pre-med, and then I decided that, and that was not really,

11:20.853 --> 11:27.864
I'd always talked about going off to medical school and becoming a doctor, but really didn't have a passion for it.

11:27.884 --> 11:32.531
It was just kind of the thing that everybody said, oh, you know, you ought to be a doctor, you ought to be a doctor.

11:32.591 --> 11:33.953
So I thought, well, I ought to be a doctor.

11:35.195 --> 11:42.265
And came here and realized, oh, man, there's so much to choose from, so many majors to choose from, so many things I want to do in my life.

11:43.046 --> 11:45.510
And I ended up...

11:45.490 --> 11:51.778
literally kind of by accident falling into sociology, but could not make up my mind what I wanted to do.

11:51.879 --> 12:01.331
So while I had indicated I wanted to be a doctor and wanted to do pre-med, my classes didn't stack up that way.

12:01.351 --> 12:04.175
I wasn't taking the courses that I needed.

12:04.416 --> 12:10.364
It just kind of happened by accident that I ended up declaring another major.

12:11.105 --> 12:13.708
Now back before your freshman year, did you go to fish camp?

12:14.127 --> 12:15.128
Did not go to Fish Camp.

12:15.488 --> 12:16.389
Did not go to Fish Camp.

12:17.591 --> 12:20.093
Because I was going to ask what role that played.

12:20.113 --> 12:27.941
All right, your first fall, how easy was it for you to feel you were becoming part of the institution?

12:28.542 --> 12:38.111
Oh, it was difficult the first semester because I had been so actively involved in my high school.

12:39.052 --> 12:43.797
I was student body president at my high school and class president all the previous years.

12:43.777 --> 12:52.379
And so it was a little bit unsettling to come here and not to be the big man on campus.

12:52.720 --> 12:58.836
And so starting out as a freshman, it was just really interesting.

12:58.856 --> 13:00.621
But other than that,

13:00.601 --> 13:07.311
I did not have significant problems, particularly as it relates to racial incidents.

13:09.154 --> 13:20.912
Brian Housel was predominantly white high school, and racial relations were relatively harmonious, at least from my perspective.

13:21.813 --> 13:27.081
I'm jumping to the conclusion that instead of a separationist, you've been a mainstreamer.

13:27.601 --> 13:28.644
most of your life?

13:29.065 --> 13:29.706
I really have.

13:31.110 --> 13:37.206
I don't know if it was virtue of

13:40.088 --> 13:47.897
I would say was largely driven by what was happening, what was going on with me in high school and junior high school relative to academics.

13:48.278 --> 14:00.893
I took the accelerated courses and the college prep courses, and quite frankly, I did not have very many classes with African American students.

14:01.033 --> 14:04.577
In most cases, I was the only one.

14:04.557 --> 14:07.940
I never felt like I was the only one.

14:07.960 --> 14:12.484
I mean, it would just dawn on me some days, oh, okay, well, it was no big deal.

14:12.604 --> 14:18.049
I mean, so I did not come to Texas A&M.

14:18.670 --> 14:33.923
That's part of why I thought about even going to historically black college was that am I missing something out of my academic experience or life experience that I need to do?

14:34.207 --> 14:37.696
And then I just decided, well, no, I don't need to do that.

14:37.716 --> 14:38.442
You lived at home.

14:38.583 --> 14:39.087
Lived at home.

14:39.758 --> 14:41.020
So you drove out here each day?

14:41.040 --> 14:41.821
Drove out here each day.

14:41.841 --> 14:43.483
By yourself, or was there a group?

14:43.503 --> 14:44.905
Nope, drove out here by myself each day.

14:45.165 --> 14:50.632
How did you get a circle of friends, colleagues, buddies?

14:50.652 --> 14:56.019
Well, I did have a good number of my high school friends who came to school here.

14:56.319 --> 15:08.415
And interesting, I was walking through the student center one day, and there was a group of students gathered around the piano, a group of African-American students gathered around the piano, and they were singing gospel music.

15:08.699 --> 15:10.601
And I thought, well, what is going on here?

15:10.621 --> 15:14.166
And so I went in and just kind of sat and watched them.

15:14.246 --> 15:24.038
And as it turns out, it was just the very beginning or the embryo of what's turned out to be the gospel choir here on campus.

15:24.398 --> 15:28.864
And just kind of sat around and started talking to those guys.

15:28.964 --> 15:33.930
And in fact, Karen was a part of that group too.

15:34.831 --> 15:36.032
Karen Wright was a part of that group.

15:36.113 --> 15:38.115
And in fact,

15:38.095 --> 15:43.720
That was also my introduction to the Black Awareness Committee on campus.

15:44.061 --> 15:49.086
And so I immediately got involved in that after being introduced.

15:49.106 --> 16:05.301
So my friends really came from my high school friends who were here and then my new college friends who were largely African American out of that interaction really that very day that I went over there and the choir was practicing.

16:05.787 --> 16:10.374
Describe a typical, for you that freshman year, describe a typical day.

16:10.434 --> 16:12.538
What time did you get up and get here?

16:12.618 --> 16:14.220
What did you do all day?

16:15.262 --> 16:19.729
Gosh, get up and head to campus.

16:20.370 --> 16:25.939
Generally, I had an 8 o'clock class, and so that was always a struggle.

16:25.919 --> 16:31.825
Even though you do it in high school, it's like for some reason in college you're not supposed to have an 8 o'clock class.

16:32.385 --> 16:38.672
But I would come to campus and pretty much go through my routine, go through all my classes.

16:38.692 --> 16:44.598
If I had breaks during class, I'd go to the library or go to the student center and kind of sit and read.

16:47.300 --> 16:50.063
But didn't really develop relationships.

16:50.083 --> 16:55.909
I was feeling lost and feeling

16:55.889 --> 17:01.901
some anxiety about, okay, here I am, now a freshman, and nobody really cares.

17:03.805 --> 17:12.784
But I don't believe it's, that was largely my, largely conclusions that I drew, not

17:12.764 --> 17:17.470
And those conclusions were drawn not from a bad experience, but from no experience.

17:17.971 --> 17:28.225
And I just assumed, well, this place is huge, and so we'll just be sitting around here, and maybe one day when I'm a senior, I'll be able to matter.

17:29.727 --> 17:35.515
But I would eat lunch here, and then at the end of the day, would just go right back home.

17:35.630 --> 17:38.998
Now, when did the day end?

17:39.258 --> 17:44.090
Generally early afternoon, generally early afternoon, and I'd go back home.

17:44.370 --> 17:51.968
I'd go back home or go straight to work because I worked at the mall in Mantares Mall, so I worked

17:51.948 --> 18:06.985
at the music store there and at Musicland and did that and eventually I decided that I would look for a job here on campus and ended up with a part-time job here on campus, here in the library as a matter of fact.

18:07.005 --> 18:07.585
That first year?

18:07.986 --> 18:12.951
No, this would have been probably my junior year.

18:13.972 --> 18:19.879
Do you have any recollection of in round numbers what that first year cost in dollars and cents?

18:21.361 --> 18:23.052
Do you remember any kind of total?

18:25.917 --> 18:31.983
Probably about, for some reason, I just keep saying the $500 on my fee slip.

18:32.884 --> 18:36.388
I generally would take 12 hours, because I was going to work 20.

18:36.408 --> 18:40.732
I always wanted to work at least 20, and sometimes it was 30 hours.

18:41.192 --> 18:49.761
But for some reason, I remember it being $500, $600 a semester, plus another couple hundred dollars for books.

18:49.781 --> 18:51.823
Another couple hundred, another $250 for books.

18:51.803 --> 18:56.147
And you were earning about, you were paying what percentage of those costs?

18:56.628 --> 19:10.082
I got, well, very early on I was paying probably about 20% because I was able to get a grant, a Pell Grant.

19:11.343 --> 19:17.389
And I did not get any loans until a little later on.

19:17.842 --> 19:31.968
I did get emergency loans and I got those only because I was generally late or there was some holdup with my Pell Grant and needed to have my fees paid by the cutoff dates.

19:32.028 --> 19:33.210
And so that's what I would do.

19:33.250 --> 19:34.753
I would take out a short term loan,

19:34.733 --> 19:47.589
pay those off, and then when my grant would come, they'd apply the grant, we'd pay off the loan, and then what was left generally was about $100 left, well, sometimes, and maybe less than that.

19:47.609 --> 19:55.138
Then the rest, I guess I ended up probably paying largely for my books out of my own pocket and then any other expenses that I had.

19:55.979 --> 20:02.087
During that first year, what extracurricular activities or events did you, did you go to Yale practice?

20:02.227 --> 20:06.212
I went to Yale practice, and that was neat.

20:07.994 --> 20:10.758
Went to, so it was largely athletic events.

20:10.778 --> 20:11.699
Bonfire?

20:11.759 --> 20:15.003
Bonfire, went to Bonfire, and that was really neat.

20:15.644 --> 20:17.146
I was trying to remember if there was.

20:17.806 --> 20:19.028
You went to football games.

20:19.208 --> 20:20.670
Went to football games.

20:20.650 --> 20:27.461
largely football and basketball games and bonfire, Yale practice.

20:28.242 --> 20:29.083
That was really about it.

20:30.085 --> 20:33.991
I'm looking at my typical questions.

20:34.772 --> 20:36.595
Describe what you wore to class.

20:36.635 --> 20:37.396
How did you dress?

20:39.219 --> 20:40.902
Oh, very casual.

20:41.783 --> 20:45.549
Jeans and a t-shirt.

20:45.629 --> 20:47.232
What type of shoes?

20:48.494 --> 20:53.220
I was not a big tennis shoe person, so I generally had a pair of very comfortable loafers.

20:54.682 --> 20:56.865
My favorite pair of shoes were my penny loafers.

20:57.085 --> 21:03.353
Any kind of a haircut that was distinctive or anything?

21:03.853 --> 21:11.703
Well, yeah, it was pretty popular then as an African American that you would wear a curl, as we call them.

21:11.723 --> 21:13.506
And it's just a curly perm.

21:13.706 --> 21:17.050
It would curl my hair even more.

21:17.300 --> 21:25.757
So, how did your circle of friends grow?

21:28.488 --> 21:45.142
My circle of friends grew with my involvement on campus, largely with the MSC, because I got involved really through the Black Awareness Committee and I was like, well, what is all this other stuff that's going on here?

21:46.004 --> 21:49.551
And lots of committees to be involved in.

21:49.531 --> 22:15.616
I had always had an interest in politics so I was interested in political forum and then the great issues committee and so I would not be active or I was not a regular member and regular participant but I'd attend their programs or participate in a very small way in planning or bringing a program to campus.

22:15.776 --> 22:16.737
That's not the freshman year.

22:16.717 --> 22:24.290
No, this all happened about, really happened about my sophomore year.

22:25.913 --> 22:39.096
As you look back on it, what could we learn from your experience about how to get freshmen like you today, what could we do today to get them more involved?

22:42.974 --> 22:53.166
Boy, that's a tough one because a lot of it requires some initiative on the part of the individual.

22:53.206 --> 23:06.822
I think when the organizations host their open houses, open house events when they host, rush when they host, all those kinds of activities where students are presented with an opportunity.

23:06.802 --> 23:10.166
I think students will take advantage of it.

23:10.967 --> 23:23.021
It could be that marketing is a big deal where we actually talk more to the students about how positive their experience can be.

23:23.321 --> 23:31.251
Nowadays, I think there is so much more demand on student leaders than there were when I was a student.

23:31.511 --> 23:34.935
I think the demands on their time are significant.

23:34.915 --> 23:42.073
The issues that I think they're tackling with their organizations is much more significant, and so the time requirement

23:43.572 --> 24:05.108
now is i think a concern because i mean our primary reason for being here is to you know to get a degree and and so it's it's it's i know quite a few students struggle with um and it's so very easy to come consumed in your student organization and and just forget about forget about class because you're having so much fun well while you're

24:05.088 --> 24:10.414
And in a lot of cases, you're just doing what you learned in class or you're applying what you learned in the classroom.

24:13.478 --> 24:16.401
You still should be not forgetting about your classroom.

24:17.482 --> 24:28.395
And so I think if students have an opportunity, I think if we could do a better job of marketing to the students about those opportunities,

24:28.763 --> 24:47.736
I think we do a pretty good job of recruiting students who now, or students who come now wanting to be involved, but there is still this portion of the student body that does not want to be involved in all those kinds of things, and I think it's perfectly okay.

24:47.756 --> 24:52.003
Because I'm assuming that the student who lives off campus

24:52.777 --> 25:07.659
whether a local student who lives at home or an out-of-town student who lives in an apartment, that those students could easily be class attenders only.

25:07.679 --> 25:11.444
And so it's to draw out those who want to be.

25:12.586 --> 25:14.869
Can you think back of any...

25:15.406 --> 25:16.851
You mentioned the gospel choir.

25:17.735 --> 25:26.547
Can you think of any other specific event or incident that you could look back on and say, oh, that one helped to get me started?

25:32.180 --> 25:36.485
Is there some advisor, some friend that said, come on?

25:38.748 --> 25:39.469
This is interesting.

25:39.789 --> 25:46.037
One day I was, I happened to be, I was reading the newspaper, reading the battalion.

25:47.118 --> 25:53.166
And there was this announcement in the battalion about the new MSC president.

25:53.186 --> 25:56.450
And I kept saying, okay, I don't understand this MSC president.

25:56.470 --> 25:59.233
And the Black Awareness Committee is somehow related to this.

25:59.213 --> 26:16.939
That day, I remember reading that paper, and let's see, the person that was selected was, it was Greg Hawkins, who had just been named MSC president.

26:16.959 --> 26:21.986
And so I was, well, let me figure out what this MSC president stuff is all about.

26:22.327 --> 26:24.610
That sounds like it could be a lot of fun.

26:25.491 --> 26:28.596
It sounds like an opportunity for me to get involved in.

26:28.576 --> 26:32.484
Okay, then all of my memories of high school started coming back.

26:32.604 --> 26:34.928
Oh yeah, I love stuff like this.

26:35.209 --> 26:43.204
And so I, in fact, asked other people, okay, what is, you know, and shortly thereafter, the rest of the council was announced.

26:43.224 --> 26:44.928
And so I was really intrigued.

26:44.948 --> 26:48.555
Well, who are all these people and where are they?

26:48.575 --> 26:49.757
What are these positions?

26:49.737 --> 27:05.755
And so that day, having seen the battalion, that really sparked my interest to get more involved or to look for an opportunity outside just the committee and thought, man, okay, this is something I can really do.

27:05.775 --> 27:10.601
So that was another turning point for me in terms of student involvement.

27:10.621 --> 27:17.989
And that curiosity led you to go over and... Led me to get much more interested in not just the committee, but the council.

27:18.762 --> 27:26.972
And at that point, I made up my mind that I didn't know what council position, but I knew that I wanted a council position.

27:27.092 --> 27:29.481
How did you make that known to somebody that mattered?

27:29.866 --> 27:33.030
I did not for a very long time.

27:33.070 --> 27:35.373
You just made it known to yourself.

27:35.393 --> 27:36.454
I just made it known to myself.

27:36.715 --> 27:49.851
And as I got more and more involved, I talked to one of the advisors, Arlene Mathey, who was the Black Awareness Committee advisor at that point, and then Charlie Walters was also our advisor.

27:49.932 --> 27:54.237
And so I would ask them questions about, well, how do you get a position on council?

27:54.723 --> 28:01.543
And what they said to me, well, what's really valuable if you want to be on the council is that you get some committee experience.

28:02.063 --> 28:14.114
You know, being involved in more committees gives you additional visibility, you learn more about the organization, and the opportunity for you to be in a council role will come.

28:14.374 --> 28:30.028
And so when one of my good college friends, Charnella Swanson, decided she was going to apply for the chairmanship for the Black Awareness Committee,

28:30.008 --> 28:37.956
and she was named, I went to her and I said, I was very direct.

28:38.337 --> 28:41.700
I went to her and said, okay, I want to be your number two person on your committee.

28:43.022 --> 28:45.064
And she's like, well, I haven't decided how I want to structure.

28:45.084 --> 28:47.226
And I said, well, okay, well, I'm not worried about that.

28:47.707 --> 28:49.008
I want to be your number two person.

28:49.789 --> 28:52.031
And so, this is really weird.

28:52.992 --> 28:54.514
A couple of days later,

28:55.287 --> 28:59.453
I went to her dorm room, and I forget what hall she lived in.

29:00.895 --> 29:02.177
I went there very early in the morning.

29:02.938 --> 29:04.741
In fact, she was not even up yet.

29:06.664 --> 29:08.527
And I presented her with an organizational chart.

29:08.687 --> 29:18.662
I said, I've been thinking about this Black Awareness Committee thing, and here's how I think, based on what you told me you wanted to get accomplished, here's how I think this structure might work.

29:20.026 --> 29:21.788
And here's how I think it ought to look.

29:23.069 --> 29:32.881
She did wake up and talk to me about it and just in a nice way told me to calm down and that there will be opportunity.

29:32.921 --> 29:41.190
So when the opportunity came, literally she decided to create this new structure.

29:42.392 --> 29:44.094
She changed it some.

29:44.114 --> 29:46.176
She put her own flavor on it.

29:47.157 --> 29:48.919
But there was this number two position.

29:50.215 --> 29:53.939
And so I applied and interviewed.

29:54.400 --> 29:58.004
It was an interview process with she and the advisor, and I was selected.

29:58.765 --> 30:00.427
Now this was your sophomore year?

30:00.447 --> 30:01.768
This would have been my sophomore year.

30:03.690 --> 30:05.813
No, no, it was my junior year.

30:07.094 --> 30:12.240
Because I was a fifth year senior when I became MSC president, council president.

30:12.676 --> 30:15.768
That's your introduction to the kind of hierarchy.

30:15.788 --> 30:16.370
Yes.

30:16.511 --> 30:18.920
MSC director at this point, is that Jim Reynolds?

30:18.940 --> 30:19.522
Jim Reynolds.

30:19.542 --> 30:20.827
Wayne Starks already retired.

30:20.847 --> 30:22.112
Wayne Starks retired.

30:23.223 --> 30:25.447
Then move us on up.

30:25.767 --> 30:26.969
Okay.

30:27.450 --> 30:40.932
After that, we had a pretty phenomenal year with the Black Awareness Committee and at that point I also got involved with Fall Leadership Conference and did I get involved with Spring Leadership?

30:41.113 --> 30:47.323
No, I did not get involved and got a lot more involved with Great Issues Committee.

30:47.303 --> 30:55.220
When the next year came around, everybody assumed that I was going to apply for the chairmanship, or I should say a lot of people assumed I was going to apply for the chairmanship.

30:55.240 --> 31:01.775
At that point, I was very interested in the council because I really managed a lot of our relationship, the committee's relationship with the council.

31:02.236 --> 31:04.300
So I began to really

31:04.280 --> 31:09.065
really figure out or really investigate processes.

31:09.125 --> 31:13.630
So I knew what the program approval process was and I knew what role the council played.

31:13.670 --> 31:22.579
And so I took responsibility for literally for kind of always having our presentations for council ready to go.

31:22.920 --> 31:26.643
And so I decided that next year to apply for the VP for cultural programs.

31:26.804 --> 31:27.905
No, no, I take that back.

31:28.866 --> 31:32.970
I decided to apply for the executive vice president for administration.

31:32.950 --> 31:37.054
So I was going to leapfrog the VP and do the executive VP.
