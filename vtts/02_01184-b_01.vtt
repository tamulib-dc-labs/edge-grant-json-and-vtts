00:07.085 --> 00:07.746
Away we go. This is Ron Shorn taping Tom Barnes at 
the University of California, Berkeley on June

00:08.707 --> 00:16.259
8th, 1993. Okay, let's try it. For the record, Tom, 
what's your name? Thomas Brady Barnes III. And

00:21.967 --> 00:24.231
where and when were you born? I was born in 
Columbus, Ohio on August 17th, 1944. When did you

00:29.478 --> 00:32.603
first get interested in astronomy? Really, 
during my freshman week when I was at the

00:33.545 --> 00:42.954
University of Rochester, I went there as a 
chemistry major and decided that I ought to be sure

00:33.545 --> 00:42.954
of that. So I sat down with the catalog, read all the 
way through the catalog of majors and said,

00:43.074 --> 00:49.440
astrophysics sounds right. I decided I had been 
more interested in astronomy through my growing

00:51.202 --> 00:59.750
up years than chemistry, so I switched majors. 
When did you get your bachelor's degree? 1966 from

01:01.658 --> 01:04.321
Rochester. And then where did you go to grad 
school? University of Toronto. Why? I wanted to

01:08.606 --> 01:25.607
get, I wanted to do my work with, in Variable Stars 
and Don Ferney was, and still is, at the University

01:08.606 --> 01:25.607
of Toronto and he had done some really nice work on 
Cepheids, so I picked Toronto. Okay, and when you

01:26.228 --> 01:32.175
got there, of course, you took classes and 
everything, but what did you do your thesis on and

01:26.228 --> 01:32.175
under who? I did a master's thesis on secret galaxy 
variability with Don Ferny, and then I did my Ph.D.

01:32.976 --> 01:47.172
thesis also with Ferny on statistical parallaxes 
of MIRA variables to get the absolute magnitude.

01:47.332 --> 01:50.976
Okay, then you get your Ph.D., and it's time to get a 
real job. Where did you go? I went to McDonald

01:53.077 --> 01:57.081
Observatory as a W.J. McDonald Fellow in the fall 
of 1970. How did that start? Did you see a notice on

02:01.465 --> 02:05.309
the bulletin board or something like that? In 
1970, when I started making applications, the job

02:06.050 --> 02:12.116
market was really tight. I mean, it got even 
tighter later, but it was pretty tight. And so I

02:15.259 --> 02:22.206
applied for darn near everything I could find, and 
I honestly don't remember where I saw the notice on

02:22.372 --> 02:24.234
it. And I don't remember that I paid much attention 
to it as an application other than I sent it in, as I

02:25.035 --> 02:35.227
did a whole lot of other ones. And then I got a call 
from Harlan Smith offering it to me in the spring of

02:35.508 --> 02:41.174
70. And I had a couple of other things pending at 
that time that hadn't been resolved. One, for

02:48.063 --> 02:51.687
example, at the University of Western Ontario. 
that after talking with various faculty members,

02:51.785 --> 03:02.200
I decided that I would drop out of the other ones and 
take the MacDonald Fellowship. Okay, so your

03:02.220 --> 03:08.348
first contact with Harlan was over the telephone, 
but what was your first trip to Texas like?

03:09.490 --> 03:12.795
Actually, I met Harlan before I went to Texas. I met 
him at the IAU in Grenoble. in uh in august

03:16.675 --> 03:43.088
september whenever it was in 1970 and uh i remember 
thinking when i met him that this is a character

03:16.675 --> 03:43.088
because every word he said about texas was it's the 
best in the world i remember distinctly him

03:16.675 --> 03:43.088
telling me about the accountant at texas keeping 
the books bill geist and how he was the best

03:16.675 --> 03:43.088
accountant in the world and i thought This is 
really remarkable that everything there is the

03:43.523 --> 04:01.692
best in the world, because it wasn't quite the way 
I'd heard it from people before I went there, that

03:43.523 --> 04:01.692
there was some concern about, well, it was kind of a 
new department, a struggling department, but

03:43.523 --> 04:01.692
they had some big telescopes and a lot of access to 
those telescopes, which is why I went. So I moved

04:02.293 --> 04:07.641
there in October 1970, and...

04:08.549 --> 04:13.514
The department and the observatory were still 
housed in Painter Hall, the old physics building.

04:13.694 --> 04:16.217
Right within close range of the Texas Tower. 
That's right. In fact, this was not long after the

04:17.398 --> 04:24.525
Texas Tower incident, and that actually didn't 
give me any pause. I didn't consider that as a

04:24.625 --> 04:28.489
negative for going to Texas. It was purely an 
astronomical decision.

04:35.356 --> 04:37.678
When you got there, how... Roughly, how big was the 
department? I mean, how many staff and how many

04:39.865 --> 04:44.832
people at McDonald and the department? I mean, 
it's hard for me to remember because it was almost

04:44.952 --> 04:50.639
23 years ago. But I suppose there were probably six 
or eight faculty, I guess, maybe ten. I don't

04:59.150 --> 05:01.213
remember how many grad students there were. The 
conditions in Pater were very crowded. It was

05:06.020 --> 05:07.902
really, we were packed. into that particular 
building the floors we occupied on that building

05:08.084 --> 05:38.091
right up into the attic so it was pretty crowded 
conditions but it didn't seem to bother people by

05:08.084 --> 05:38.091
and large in fact it was kind of nice in some ways 
because we interacted more strongly than when

05:08.084 --> 05:38.091
you're on three separate floors that's right um 
what did you do when you first went there uh well i

05:08.084 --> 05:38.091
went as a postdoc and so i got an office with uh with 
bill hubbard and uh and Bruce,

05:38.408 --> 05:45.555
God, all of a sudden I can't remember his last name, 
Josephson Junction Fellow.

05:48.458 --> 05:51.802
And I occupied the desk that Steve Little had 
before he left. He was a previous postdoc. So I

05:54.284 --> 06:06.897
started doing a program that I had planned to do, 
which was 4N hypersensitized plates of globular

05:54.284 --> 06:06.897
clusters to do VRI photometry of miras.

06:09.475 --> 06:12.039
Okay, so you're using ammoniated foreign plates. 
That didn't last very long because I discovered

06:12.580 --> 06:22.316
pretty quickly, even with the 82-inch telescope, 
that I wasn't going to be able to get what I wanted

06:12.580 --> 06:22.316
out of the plates. And so I looked around for 
something else to do during the two postdoc years,

06:23.298 --> 06:35.297
and I discovered that David Lambert was working 
with Reinhardt Beer. of Jet Propulsion Lab with a

06:35.834 --> 06:44.608
Fourier transform spectrometer on the 2.7 meter, 
which at that time was still third largest

06:35.834 --> 06:44.608
telescope in the world. And this Fourier 
transform spectrometer was state of the art at

06:45.309 --> 06:48.634
that time. It stayed that way for three or four 
years. And it was fascinating. It was highly

06:53.041 --> 06:55.224
mathematical. They needed somebody with some 
observational experience involved. And so I kind

07:00.873 --> 07:04.018
of fell in with that group. began working FTS stuff 
for six or eight months and then David offered to

07:04.673 --> 07:12.345
move me on to one of these grants. So I dropped off 
the fellowship and I stayed with Fourier

07:12.946 --> 07:23.863
Transformers for about six years.

07:24.333 --> 07:35.527
One of the reasons I'm asking you is that you're at a 
place, and you're the assistant director now, I

07:24.333 --> 07:35.527
guess, at McDonald's, that is very heavily 
involved in planetary work, one of the few places

07:24.333 --> 07:35.527
it is. But you're not really a planetary 
astronomer, so you've got a different point of

07:36.147 --> 07:39.552
view. I mean, you're not going to lose your grant if 
you tell the truth, all right? When you came to UT,

07:48.042 --> 07:55.149
originally,

07:48.042 --> 07:55.149
what would you say was the status of planetary 
astronomy at that time? Was it an integral part of

07:55.169 --> 07:59.434
the department, or was it a big deal, or did people 
just suffer it to be?

08:03.237 --> 08:07.282
I think it was pretty clearly an integral part of 
the department from my perspective. In fact, a lot

08:07.442 --> 08:17.492
of the time I spent observing with that FTS 
instrument was on planets, was on Jupiter,

08:07.442 --> 08:17.492
because that was what Reinhardt Beer was 
interested in doing. We also did long period

08:18.637 --> 08:23.563
variables and some other things which were more of 
interest to me and to David Lambert. But we got

08:23.603 --> 08:36.860
tremendously great amounts of observing time on a 
huge telescope, mostly because, I'm pretty sure,

08:23.603 --> 08:36.860
because of the planetary connection of that 
program. In fact, I think my one planetary

08:37.201 --> 08:46.753
publication is I'm last author of about five or six 
on the first detection of deuterium off the Earth.

08:47.105 --> 08:50.689
which was induterated methane in Jupiter from 
that instrument. There was a lot of planetary

08:53.031 --> 08:58.357
astronomy going on on the 107-inch or 2.7-meter. I 
mean, Ed Barker was there doing it. There were a

09:03.702 --> 09:05.104
number of other people involved. Bill Hubbard was 
there with planetary interiors work. To me, it

09:10.109 --> 09:13.112
seemed like it was clearly an integral part of the 
program. One thing that I think is a mistake in big

09:13.345 --> 09:22.318
and bright in the history of McDonald's is that no 
one who was not a faculty member at UT was ever

09:13.345 --> 09:22.318
mentioned. So that leaves out Ice Spinrad, it 
leaves out Topia, and it leaves me. And we all,

09:25.943 --> 09:31.131
between us, got a substantial amount of telescope 
time. Was there ever any... And, of course, that

09:31.191 --> 09:38.421
was because NASA said, you know, you've got to 
use... We give you the money, you've got to do it.

09:38.962 --> 09:41.766
Was there any... jealousy, rage among UT faculty 
members about us outsiders using the telescope? I

09:51.018 --> 09:52.462
don't remember any from then. I remember a lot of 
that later. But I don't remember any from then.

09:56.049 --> 10:04.077
Now, that may be because I was so intent as a new 
postdoc in learning this system and getting

09:56.049 --> 10:04.077
established myself that I wasn't paying 
attention to it. I also wasn't connected in to the

10:04.617 --> 10:11.545
faculty and those sorts of discussions to the 
extent that I am today. So I may have just missed it.

10:13.246 --> 10:21.895
But I don't recall there being any anti-solar 
system stuff at that time in the early 70s. Was

10:23.022 --> 10:28.409
there, were planetary astronomers looked down on 
by real, quote, unquote, astronomers? And this is

10:28.469 --> 10:32.674
like a Toronto and places like that that didn't 
have any planetary problems. Were you aware of

10:32.694 --> 10:34.456
anything like that? No, I wasn't. I never got that 
sense at Toronto or at Rochester, although at

10:36.999 --> 10:45.070
neither place were there any planetary 
astronomers. And so the topic most likely didn't

10:45.130 --> 10:48.474
come up very much. Do you think planetary 
astronomy is real astronomy? Sure. Sure, I sure

10:52.300 --> 10:54.123
do. I think it's exciting stuff. Now, as I recall, 
NASA for many years had this block grant for

10:55.765 --> 11:09.165
planetary astronomy that they gave to McDonald, 
and then in, what, 88 or 87 or something, it was

10:55.765 --> 11:09.165
switched to individuals or something like that? 
That's right.

11:12.630 --> 11:17.177
I became aware of this later on when I got involved 
in administrative matters, but NASA provided a

11:17.765 --> 11:32.344
facilities grant, or a block grant as it was 
called, to McDonald in exchange for access to the

11:17.765 --> 11:32.344
McDonald facilities, principally the 107-inch, 
by planetary astronomers throughout the U.S.

11:33.325 --> 11:38.432
They had to compete for the telescope time, which 
in the early years meant that Harlan had to agree to

11:33.325 --> 11:38.432
give it to you. Later, there got to be a pack and a 
real competition that was involved. I was the last

11:43.198 --> 11:47.063
person in the world, and I guess because Harlan 
suggested I do it, to write my letters asking for

11:47.768 --> 11:54.396
telescope time in pen and ink on paper. He got a kick 
out of that. But I mean, no kidding. I would really

11:57.599 --> 12:00.343
write them on pen and ink in paper. And I still got 
some Xerox copies of that stuff. And I guess he was

12:03.066 --> 12:04.808
the last observatory. I mean, he was the last 
old-time observatory director that made the

12:04.848 --> 12:10.114
decisions without a... observing committee or 
anything like that. Is that true? That's right.

12:13.958 --> 12:19.084
During most of the 70s, now I'm not sure what year it 
changed, but it was right around 1978. It may have

12:19.645 --> 12:34.802
been a year or two earlier or a year or two, 
certainly not more than a year or so later, that

12:19.645 --> 12:34.802
prior to that time, Harlan kept a huge poster board 
of graph paper, basically, on in his office and he

12:35.423 --> 13:03.085
had each telescope and he had the calendar on the 
x-axis and each telescope was listed on the y-axis

12:35.423 --> 13:03.085
and he would write in and pencil the observing 
programs and since and he wrote him in on pencil

12:35.423 --> 13:03.085
because he would change them right up to the day of 
the run there were times when when my observing

12:35.423 --> 13:03.085
runs were were changed at the last minute for a 
variety of reasons none of which seemed to me good

12:35.423 --> 13:03.085
at the time but i'm sure they were good in his eyes uh 
and that went on until um uh as i say the late 70s when

13:03.520 --> 13:27.250
the scheduling was turned over to david evans and 
then maybe pretty quickly rob robinson uh began

13:03.520 --> 13:27.250
helping him with it and they did it in a similar way 
in the sense that they had golf tees and pegboard

13:03.520 --> 13:27.250
and they they reproduced harlan's uh graph paper 
system and a different mechanism, but it was still

13:28.208 --> 13:32.993
the same thing. You submitted your proposals. 
They sort of read them and decided who got

13:34.235 --> 13:38.880
telescope time and put the pegboard up 
accordingly. And then it was in the early to

13:39.481 --> 13:58.182
mid-'80s, we went over to an actual TAC, the 
Telescope Allocation Committee, which reviewed

13:39.481 --> 13:58.182
the proposals, made decisions, and those 
decisions were honored by Harlan and now by the

13:39.481 --> 13:58.182
current director, Frank Batch. Honest Engine 
Scout Center is committee allocation of

13:58.887 --> 14:10.039
telescope time better than beneficent despot. 
I've thought a lot about that because I've seen

14:10.339 --> 14:20.230
both of them at Texas, and my conclusion is that 
from the point of view of the science that gets

14:10.339 --> 14:20.230
done, I don't think it makes a worth of difference. 
From the point of view of the feelings of the people

14:20.751 --> 14:24.895
getting – Proposing for time and getting the time 
it makes a tremendous difference because When

14:25.043 --> 14:37.551
there's a group of colleagues who evaluate one's 
proposal come to their best decision and then

14:25.043 --> 14:37.551
render that judgment there is more acceptance 
than when a single individual says, I've made the

14:37.885 --> 14:46.197
decision based on my best reading of the 
circumstances. So I don't think it makes any

14:46.297 --> 14:49.321
difference in the science that gets done. I don't 
think it made any difference when it went from

14:49.802 --> 14:55.811
Harlan to David Evans to the TAC in who got 
telescope time. I haven't done the statistics to

14:55.911 --> 14:58.875
prove it, but I don't believe there was any 
difference. But there was a tremendous

14:59.696 --> 15:05.985
improvement in the acceptance of the telescope 
schedule by the people listed on it. Now,

15:06.488 --> 15:11.916
currently, you're the assistant director at 
McDonald's, and Frank is on vacation. So I'll hit

15:13.878 --> 15:18.685
you, because usually it's like the co-pilot 
always lands the plane. The assistant director

15:18.765 --> 15:20.588
does all the work. What's the status of planetary 
astronomy at UT and Texas today? I think it's as

15:27.077 --> 15:35.989
healthy as it was at any time in the history of 
Texas. There's obviously the difference that

15:36.610 --> 15:45.582
there is not someone with an intense interest in 
planetary astronomy in the directorship

15:36.610 --> 15:45.582
position. That changed when Harlan retired as 
director and Frank came in. Frank's a radio

15:49.928 --> 15:54.034
astronomer interested in galaxies, in galactic 
structure. And he's not hostile to planetary

15:54.554 --> 15:59.962
astronomy, but it's not of intense interest to him 
such as it was for Harlan. So that changed. The

16:04.167 --> 16:06.070
quality of the research hasn't changed at all. 
We've got both the Cochrans are still there. Larry

16:08.474 --> 16:09.515
Trafton's there. Ed Barker's there. There are a 
couple of postdocs that have come and gone working

16:11.598 --> 16:16.226
in that area. Artie Hotzis is there now working 
with Bill Cochran. The emphasis of the program has

16:19.831 --> 16:27.643
changed somewhat as the years go by, but that's 
normal in any research program.

16:28.450 --> 16:31.454
I think the quality of the program now is as good as 
it's ever been. The amount of telescope time

16:32.235 --> 16:38.805
granted to planetary astronomy in this 
competitive attack environment has stayed high.

16:39.446 --> 16:46.455
It consistently exceeds the amount of time that's 
been funded by NASA. We still get quite a few

16:47.357 --> 16:50.401
outside observers coming in. There's Drew Potter 
from JSC. There's Alan Stern from Southwest

16:53.966 --> 16:56.770
Research. Institute and others who come in to make 
use of the McDonald facilities. So I think it's as

17:04.626 --> 17:07.449
healthy as it's ever been. Here's something that 
goes for astronomy in general as well as planetary

17:07.509 --> 17:11.574
astronomy. Times are getting tough, folks. What 
do you see in the future? And I think planetary

17:16.180 --> 17:24.630
astronomy will just, because we both agree it's 
part of astronomy, so it's going to rise and fall

17:16.180 --> 17:24.630
with the tide. What do you think's in the future for 
the next couple of years in a couple of decades With

17:25.555 --> 17:49.453
respect to

17:25.555 --> 17:49.453
planetary astronomy I Think for McDonald things 
are really looking up McDonald overall fields

17:25.555 --> 17:49.453
because on April 1st the Regents approved the 
spectroscopic survey telescope which is The

17:50.024 --> 17:58.180
primary will have a hexagonal shape, 91 hexagonal 
segments put together to make a hex primary, which

17:50.024 --> 17:58.180
will be 10 meters by 11 meters. So it'll be a huge 
telescope to go at McDonald, assuming that we can

17:58.701 --> 18:07.678
get all our partners to sign the legal agreements 
and that the bids for construction come back

17:58.701 --> 18:07.678
within budget. We will have that in full operation 
by sometime in 1997. And you're going to put it on

18:10.946 --> 18:13.029
flat top? It'll be on flat top. Which is now called 
Mount? Mount Fulks. Right. But it's flat top to us

18:17.395 --> 18:19.538
all the time, right? Right. So I see the prospects 
from McDonald being outstanding. And the

18:25.646 --> 18:37.041
spectroscopic survey tells us, though, that we 
dedicated the spectroscopy in a four-minute

18:25.646 --> 18:37.041
field of view, so it's not appropriate for 
large-scale imaging, small imaging, okay. I see

18:37.831 --> 18:43.979
planetary astronomy having a very, very big role 
to play in that. One question that I have on my list

18:44.700 --> 18:52.830
here is how well do you think astronomers in 
general and planetary astronomers in particular

18:44.700 --> 18:52.830
have sold their field? And it's particularly 
appropriate to ask you because I think McDonald

18:53.831 --> 19:06.387
has done a tremendous job compared to, say, Mount 
Wilson and Palomar, who generally have a the

18:53.831 --> 19:06.387
public be damned attitude, I think it's fair to 
say. What do you, I mean, you're obviously doing a

19:06.772 --> 19:18.548
lot with the general public, and as you know, Susan 
Shorn is the assistant editor for Star Date. That

19:19.790 --> 19:27.801
was Harlan's idea to do it, and do you think that has 
worked out well to really get the public involved?

19:27.983 --> 19:28.944
Oh, yeah. It makes a tremendous difference in how 
we are treated within the state of Texas by the

19:28.984 --> 19:38.296
legislature and the university. Frank has said to 
me that he has sat in meetings with prominent

19:39.177 --> 19:55.037
members of the legislature, or lunches with 
prominent members of the legislature, and

19:39.177 --> 19:55.037
friends of the observatory who are discussing the 
role of McDonald with these people, who have said,

19:55.490 --> 20:10.268
that their connection to McDonald is through 
Stardate, through the magazine, through the

19:55.490 --> 20:10.268
radio program, that they take great pride in 
driving through Washington, D.C., and hearing on

19:55.490 --> 20:10.268
the radio Stardate come on in reference to the 
University of Texas at Austin. So our public

20:10.889 --> 20:21.362
outreach program is very effective for us in 
maintaining a presence with the political

20:10.889 --> 20:21.362
structure in the state of Texas. But that's, I 
mean, that is a reason for doing it. It's not the

20:24.629 --> 20:29.155
primary reason for doing it, in my mind, nor was it 
in Harlan's, nor is it in Frank's. That's a spinoff

20:29.816 --> 20:43.274
from, you do it because the people who have paid the 
bill for all of our research have a right to hear the

20:29.816 --> 20:43.274
results from that research in a way they can 
understand.

20:45.217 --> 20:46.118
You have a Huge number of other things going on with 
the public, you know, little observing sessions

20:46.317 --> 20:53.255
down at the visitor center and the visitor center. 
Have you ever thought about painting the shutters

20:53.596 --> 21:00.154
yellow and putting up a McDonald's on the 
mountain? Because everyone always expects...

21:01.758 --> 21:03.020
McDonald's Golden Arches. I know the public 
oftentimes get confused between McDonald's, the

21:03.040 --> 21:14.038
restaurant chain, and McDonald's Observatory, 
but no, we haven't actually thought about putting

21:03.040 --> 21:14.038
Yellow Arches out there. Maybe if the funding 
situation gets better. Have you ever approached

21:16.843 --> 21:18.646
McDonald's? No, not that I know of. Because, I 
mean, I don't know how many times I've been on the

21:20.449 --> 21:25.437
mountain, people say, you know, where do we get the 
hamburgers? And the second question is, where's

21:25.417 --> 21:28.882
the gasoline station? Right. And where's the 
restroom?

21:34.571 --> 21:50.395
But that is in marked contrast to a number of other 
observatories that we could name, that probably

21:34.571 --> 21:50.395
because they had private funding sources, and I'm 
talking about Molson and Bellarmine, had only

21:34.571 --> 21:50.395
discussed for the general public. There's two 
things that underlie that, I think. one of them is

21:54.458 --> 22:21.917
that in the will from w.j mcdonald in which he gave 
the bequest to the university to uh like to erect

21:54.458 --> 22:21.917
and equip i can remember the quote it's something 
like to erect and equip an astronomical an

21:54.458 --> 22:21.917
observatory for the study and the promotion of the 
study of the science of astronomy and that

21:54.458 --> 22:21.917
promotion of the study of the science of astronomy 
in his will has been used as the justification for a

22:22.268 --> 22:28.756
strong public outreach program. But I think that 
reason is more of a post-hope justification

22:29.256 --> 22:38.007
rather than something that started it. It really 
started and was maintained and grew because

22:38.327 --> 22:42.993
Harlow Smith believed in it. He was absolutely 
dedicated to a strong public outreach program. It

22:48.440 --> 22:51.263
was one of the key things he wanted to accomplish, 
and he did accomplish it. personal opinion, why do

22:51.648 --> 22:56.255
you think that kind of attitude is so rare among 
astronomers? Especially since now, basically,

22:57.317 --> 23:03.326
we're all supported by public opinion one way or 
another. You know, I think the root reason for it,

23:05.029 --> 23:17.689
in my mind, is that most researchers are not very 
facile in dealing with other people. They're

23:18.563 --> 23:33.965
outstanding in dealing with the technicalities 
of the science, in dealing with the mathematics,

23:18.563 --> 23:33.965
with the instrumentation, with the observing 
programs, with the observing plans, with the

23:18.563 --> 23:33.965
getting of the money, the writing of the grants, 
the writing of the papers. But in everyday normal

23:34.646 --> 23:43.339
social environments, I think an awful lot of 
high-tech researchers, like astronomers, are

23:34.646 --> 23:43.339
not very facile. and that they're uncomfortable 
with it. So there's a tendency to focus in on the

23:45.612 --> 24:02.634
nitty-gritty of the research and stay away from, 
and therefore later to put down, the part of

23:45.612 --> 24:02.634
research where it's communicating at a very 
elementary level the fundamentals of what we've

23:45.612 --> 24:02.634
discovered. And unless you're really good at 
communicating with the public, such as Harlan

24:03.315 --> 24:13.208
was, or to use the current example, Carl Sagan, 
unless you're really good at that, it's hard to do

24:13.525 --> 24:39.870
and if it's hard to do people tend to stay away from 
it if they stay away from it then they tend to think

24:13.525 --> 24:39.870
well that's not very important because i'm not in 
it it's not very important it tends to be downrated

24:13.525 --> 24:39.870
all right now now it's time for funny stories um all 
right you got any funny harland smith stories I

24:41.200 --> 24:47.787
mean, for example, in Big and Bright, they never 
mentioned the spectrum of the Swiss Army knife,

24:41.200 --> 24:47.787
which is probably before your time. That was 
before my time. I've heard that many times, never

24:48.848 --> 24:53.753
directly from Harlan, so I can neither confirm nor 
deny it. What was the story? Well, the story was

24:54.653 --> 24:59.919
that, in fact, I did hear that from Harlan one time. 
I did hear that from him one time. He mentioned it to

25:03.542 --> 25:07.326
me once with respect to i can't remember what to 
respect but in any event the story was that he was

25:08.133 --> 25:35.035
observing on the 82 inch telescope at coup day and 
that um the iron arc spectrum which was produced by

25:08.133 --> 25:35.035
two electrodes uh close to each other and a high uh 
electrical current flowing between the citizen

25:08.133 --> 25:35.035
arrangement right so it just gave you a big bright 
arc um that the arc was weak and that Harlan said,

25:35.960 --> 25:41.611
well, we need to adjust the arc to make it brighter 
on the plates. And so he pulled out his handy Swiss

25:42.553 --> 25:50.228
Army knife and inserted it between the electrodes 
to make the adjustment with the power on. And it is

25:50.829 --> 25:57.462
said that, in this story, I don't know if it's true 
or not, that it vaporized the blade of the knife,

25:50.829 --> 25:57.462
which is... And you

25:57.442 --> 26:07.031
can also see molecular bands from the handle of the 
Swiss Army knife. Because the shutter was open,

26:07.732 --> 26:10.094
wasn't it? I don't know that. Supposedly there is a 
spectrum that exists. Well, I've heard that. I

26:15.719 --> 26:17.381
don't know whether that's true. It's also told 
that Harlan went out and threw the knife down the

26:17.401 --> 26:21.625
mountainside. Now, that does not sound like 
Harlan. I don't believe that happened. It doesn't

26:24.982 --> 26:26.177
sound like Harlan. I don't think he would do that. 
But whether there's a plate that shows these, I

26:27.833 --> 26:31.857
don't know. Any other stories? Well, Harlan, he 
had a tendency to focus in his mind on what he was

26:37.323 --> 26:47.953
doing to the exclusion of other things going on 
around him. And we spent quite a few nights

26:48.214 --> 26:56.322
observing on a project to attempt to measure 
whether or not there was a time limit

26:56.302 --> 27:01.008
cosmologically time variability in Planck's 
constant. This was in the early 70s. And

27:03.512 --> 27:10.861
we did a lot of cast grain observing on the 107 at 
that time together.

27:14.045 --> 27:22.056
There were several nights when we would have the 
platform up off the floor, raised up to get access

27:14.045 --> 27:22.056
to the cast instrument, and Harlan would say, I'm 
going to check the weather, which meant going

27:22.660 --> 27:26.545
outside on the catwalk and walking around the 
dome. And he would just charge for the door and walk

27:27.166 --> 27:31.031
right off the platform. Now, at no time was the 
platform more than maybe two feet off the floor on

27:31.932 --> 27:38.801
any of these occasions, but it would happen night 
after night. He would be so focused on what he was

27:40.143 --> 27:47.993
doing that he wouldn't pay any attention to his 
surroundings. And he would fall off and skid along

27:48.226 --> 27:53.113
on the floor and look back and say, I must remember 
not to do that. And then he'd do it again. Do you

27:56.338 --> 27:59.983
think Harlan could have done even more had he done a 
little less?

28:02.987 --> 28:07.093
I think that's a very good question. It

28:07.233 --> 28:15.465
goes to the heart of what Harlan was like in his 
research and his directing, which is that He

28:15.867 --> 28:19.973
attempted to move on all possible fronts 
simultaneously. And it worked like a champ when

28:20.493 --> 28:24.239
there was lots of money. Because he would fund 
nearly everything. He never met an idea he didn't

28:28.124 --> 28:29.546
like. And that meant we had an incredible number of 
things going on simultaneously. And that was

28:37.778 --> 28:39.520
great when there was money to support them. 
Because some would plan to pan out, some would not.

28:41.663 --> 28:45.148
And if they didn't pan out, he'd let them go, with 
some exceptions. But when the mid-80s hit, and

28:45.753 --> 28:58.073
suddenly money began to get tight when the second 
oil crunch hit, and literally the depression hit

28:45.753 --> 28:58.073
in Texas. And the 300-inch telescope got 
eliminated. We entered an environment in which

29:04.584 --> 29:08.510
money was ever tighter. And that mode of operation 
of expanding on all fronts, funding everything

29:08.530 --> 29:12.537
possible, was simply incompatible with the 
fiscal situation. And it got more and more

29:17.393 --> 29:22.499
frustrating for Harlan as he attempted to do this 
and could not. And I think that was one of the key

29:23.581 --> 29:31.191
reasons why he chose to retire from the 
directorship in 1989. That he had, McDonald

29:31.331 --> 29:40.583
Observatory had entered an era in which it wasn't 
fun for him to be director anymore. When we had lots

29:41.137 --> 29:56.854
of money, I think if he had focused it on fewer 
efforts, we would have made a lot more progress in

29:41.137 --> 29:56.854
those efforts, but there may have been some other 
things that we accomplished that never would have

29:41.137 --> 29:56.854
got started. It's a different style, the two 
different styles. It wouldn't be Harlan if he was

29:58.736 --> 30:00.237
different. It wouldn't have been Harlan. He was 
not focused like that on specific research areas.

30:06.027 --> 30:07.809
a tremendously broad interest. I got a lot of 
comments the other week at Austin about the fact

30:08.611 --> 30:19.446
that Harlan was loyal and maybe sometimes too 
loyal, and we're talking here like image tube and

30:08.611 --> 30:19.446
everything like that. Yes. Which I guess is the 
greatest fiasco of his reign. Yes. Did they ever

30:23.672 --> 30:25.174
get anything out of that? They brought the , the 
electronographic image tube was brought to the

30:26.716 --> 30:35.528
point where it actually obtained astronomical 
data that were never used. to the best of my

30:36.082 --> 30:43.350
knowledge, they were never used because there 
were no astronomers tied into the particular

30:36.082 --> 30:43.350
program. That is that that development was funded 
by Harlan and conducted by Paul Gribbavel with

30:44.131 --> 30:55.143
almost no astronomical expertise attached to it. 
There were no astronomers demanding that this get

30:55.163 --> 31:00.729
operational so I can use it for my research. There 
weren't any. And so when it became operational,

31:02.672 --> 31:05.835
there weren't any to use it. And it became 
operational almost at the same time that CCDs came

31:06.322 --> 31:11.326
in. There was a period of a few years where the river 
ball camera could have been used for astronomical

31:12.487 --> 31:19.393
uses, but it was too late. There were no 
astronomers involved. By the time any

31:22.076 --> 31:27.881
astronomers could have got involved, CCDs had 
beat it.

31:29.182 --> 31:36.328
Do you think you, and I talked to Greg Shields, and 
I'll let you know, maybe I did tell you the other

31:29.182 --> 31:36.328
night, But we were talking in the library last 
week, and we both felt that actually in both of us,

31:36.747 --> 31:55.617
there was only one time in the 30-some years that 
I've known Harlan almost as long as Greg that we

31:36.747 --> 31:55.617
ever got to know the real Harlan. When you met him, 
he was open and all that, but do you think there was

31:56.255 --> 32:05.007
still a little curtain or something like that? Oh, 
yeah. I worked really closely with Harlan for 11

32:05.547 --> 32:10.133
years. I had the shared secretary in the office 
between us, and I saw him every day.

32:22.630 --> 32:47.322
I felt that there was always a distance between us 
almost always now there were times when that would

32:22.630 --> 32:47.322
break down and that's not to say it's not because he 
was a formal guy it's just as you say there was this

32:22.630 --> 32:47.322
veil this curtain that the inner workings of 
harlow smith were not always visible that it was

32:22.630 --> 32:47.322
very hard to know him as just another human being uh 
he was uh very closed in that respect he was he was

32:48.230 --> 33:17.292
intensely loyal as you say he was he was generous

32:48.230 --> 33:17.292
but i never really felt that i knew the real harlan 
except occasionally i would see it and one time i

32:48.230 --> 33:17.292
mentioned to you the other night that what was very 
obvious i was seeing the real harlan was when he

32:48.230 --> 33:17.292
called frank bash and me into his office or into 
frank's office this was after Harlan had quit as

33:17.609 --> 33:30.690
director, and told the two of us that he had been 
diagnosed with cancer, that it was going to be

33:17.609 --> 33:30.690
really touch and go as to whether he could be cured 
from this. uh and he was clearly very emotional

33:31.666 --> 34:01.116
about it and frank asked him a question that had to 
do with well to concentrate on winning this battle

33:31.666 --> 34:01.116
are you you told chairman are you planning to lead 
the faculty and not teach in the fall because he was

33:31.666 --> 34:01.116
scheduled to teach and harlan said uh he said no 
that he was he was going to tell the chairman but he

33:31.666 --> 34:01.116
was going to teach in the fall he was going to stay on 
the faculty he was going to continue his

33:31.666 --> 34:01.116
appointment not take retirement because The only 
security Joan had was his pension. And as he said

34:06.494 --> 34:09.979
that, he literally teared up. And I have never seen 
Harlan do that. I've never seen him do that before.

34:14.044 --> 34:26.921
And this was a real person coming through, that he 
cared deeply that Joan have whatever security he

34:14.044 --> 34:26.921
could leave her if he didn't make it through this 
illness. There were other times when he He was

34:31.403 --> 34:37.432
generous and I could see a real human being there. I 
had a bruising battle with David Evans one time

34:38.133 --> 34:51.573
over the telescope schedule in which I 
overstepped my bounds somewhat in a way that was

34:38.133 --> 34:51.573
inappropriate and irritated David. David was 
right. He had a very strong right to be irritated

34:53.797 --> 34:56.481
with me. And so we ended up having a public meeting 
in which we disagreed strongly with each other and

35:00.817 --> 35:29.507
at the conclusion in which a decision needed to be 
taken as to which of us was going to win and i was

35:00.817 --> 35:29.507
already harlan's at that time i was assistant 
director and at the end of the meeting harlan chose

35:00.817 --> 35:29.507
david's position and uh and when i got back to my 
office after that i had a small scrap of paper which

35:00.817 --> 35:29.507
had obviously just been torn off of some other 
larger piece of paper onto which was affixed a

35:29.926 --> 35:33.452
band-aid. And next to the band-aid, Harlan had 
written, one band-aid for one bruised ego, H. It

35:34.613 --> 35:45.471
was a nice touch. It took an awful lot of the sting 
out of him siding with David. He was right to do so,

35:49.878 --> 35:54.565
but it was a nice touch. It was the kind of thing that 
Harlan would do most unexpectedly. Do you think

35:58.411 --> 36:08.305
that Harlan's gung-ho, let's go get him attitude 
started to fall on the authorities in the last few

35:58.411 --> 36:08.305
years, the authorities at the University of 
Texas? I've heard that. Yeah, I think it did. I

36:14.494 --> 36:26.190
don't think they were, I think they respected 
Harlan's power, but I don't think they really

36:14.494 --> 36:26.190
liked him.

36:27.976 --> 36:29.277
I give you an example. When we were working to get 
the 300-inch telescope project approved, no, I'm

36:29.317 --> 36:38.607
sorry, let me back up. Let me give you a different 
example. When we were, at one time, the

36:39.668 --> 36:47.757
Space Telescope Science Institute was up for 
grabs. Where was it going to go? And Harlan wanted

36:48.998 --> 36:51.380
it to go in Austin. And so we were trying hard to get 
it. And he was At that moment, we were changing

36:58.165 --> 37:01.550
presidents at UT Austin. From who to who? We were 
going from Maureen Rogers to Peter Flong. And

37:11.003 --> 37:17.912
Jerry Falcon, who's now the provost and executive 
vice president of the university, and has been for

37:11.003 --> 37:17.912
many years, He was executive assistant to 
Lorraine Rogers. I don't know his exact title, but

37:22.161 --> 37:26.547
he was her right-hand man in her office. He wasn't 
vice president of something or other. So we were

37:29.411 --> 37:34.759
working through him, and we were trying hard to get 
the university to put in a proposal for SDSCI. And

37:36.101 --> 37:43.091
we

37:36.101 --> 37:43.091
went to Jerry and said, can we do this? And Jerry 
said, he said, Harlan, He said, I can't get this

37:46.090 --> 37:48.294
done. He said, I'm between two presidents here who 
can't deal with this. OK, well, after the

37:58.811 --> 38:07.204
presidency changed, we went to Peter Flon.

38:09.985 --> 38:34.457
uh we met him in the basement office of the geology 
building i believe and he was in this little bitty

38:09.985 --> 38:34.457
cubicle but he hadn't quite become president yet 
and we harlan and i went to him and spoke to him about

38:09.985 --> 38:34.457
this project and peter flawn had been at ut austin 
when harlem was building the 107-inch and he knew

38:09.985 --> 38:34.457
harlem and he'd been president after that he'd 
been president ut san antonio So I looked him in the

38:35.281 --> 38:39.788
eyes and said, I know the way you operate. I know the 
way you work. And I need you to tell me the truth on

38:40.810 --> 38:42.953
this. Have you already gone around me to the UT 
system on this project? And Harlan said,

38:49.824 --> 38:51.106
absolutely not. I would not do that. I've got to 
work with you through channels. And I sat there

38:54.371 --> 39:08.558
dumbfounded because I had personally delivered 
the materials to Executive Vice Chancellor Jim

38:54.371 --> 39:08.558
Duncan on this matter down at UT System and had 
Duncan look me in the eye and said, you realize this

38:54.371 --> 39:08.558
is out of channels? And I said, yes, sir, I know 
that. My instructions are to give you this stuff.

39:14.988 --> 39:18.272
The UT administration knew how he worked. They 
respected his power, but I don't think they liked

39:18.433 --> 39:21.276
him. And so Harlan really had a vicious streak. He 
could double deal when it was necessary. That's

39:28.666 --> 39:30.068
right. Not vicious, I mean. Vicious is not right. 
It's more that he had a very strong belief in his

39:34.394 --> 39:42.565
rightness. in that he was right, and that to some 
extent, he'd never have said it this way, but to

39:43.422 --> 39:54.739
some extent, the ends justified the means. It was 
classic in faculty meetings when I was on the

39:54.919 --> 39:59.526
faculty. It was absolutely classic the way he 
would handle the faculty, in that he had a

39:59.546 --> 40:03.712
proposal. He would bring it to the faculty to 
discuss as was right and proper. There would be a

40:08.262 --> 40:16.750
majority opposed to him, and so he would say, it's 
clear we have not reached consensus on this yet, so

40:08.262 --> 40:16.750
let's continue the discussion later. And he would 
literally continue the discussion until he had a

40:17.050 --> 40:23.056
majority. He would never let it not happen.

40:28.201 --> 40:30.003
He knew he was right. I mean, he had no question but 
that he was right. And I'm going to change the

40:34.607 --> 40:36.649
subject. One of the things I put in this proposal 
that NASA bought was that any good observatory, if

40:36.967 --> 40:48.505
they're lucky, has somebody, and in the case of 
McDonald's, it's Bob Tull, whose equipment we

40:36.967 --> 40:48.505
have all used. And yet, those kind of guys don't get 
to write scientific papers, and there's a guy,

40:49.627 --> 40:58.962
John Geary, for example, at the Center for 
Astrophysics, who's the Bob Tull of the Center for

40:49.627 --> 40:58.962
Astrophysics. Without them, we'd all be dead 
meat. Right. Right. Bob Tall is still alive and

41:01.722 --> 41:06.609
well and kicking, but how do you handle those 
people? How do you keep them on the payroll? I mean,

41:08.131 --> 41:17.184
they're necessary, but they don't meet, I mean, 
they're absolutely vital, but they don't meet the

41:08.131 --> 41:17.184
qualifications of the philosophy department or 
the English department or whatever. The way

41:19.367 --> 41:22.532
Harlan did it with Bob Tall was that Just before I 
got to Texas, I don't know how much before, maybe

41:23.103 --> 41:37.598
the same year I got there, Bob was denied tenure, a 
promotion from assistant professor to associate

41:23.103 --> 41:37.598
professor by the faculty, I assume based on 
publication criteria. Weight of paper. Weight of

41:38.759 --> 41:42.723
paper and number of publications and science 
done. Whereas he was clearly an unbelievable

41:42.743 --> 41:48.749
talent, a world-class talent in 
instrumentation. So Harlan told me later, And he

41:52.128 --> 41:56.113
said this a number of different times in all the 
time I knew him. So it's something that I know

41:56.193 --> 42:02.320
happened, although I wasn't there to witness it. 
And he said that after that decision was taken, he

42:02.340 --> 42:10.570
told Bob Tull that as far as he and Harlan Smith was 
concerned, Bob Tull had tenure. And that Bob Tull

42:11.551 --> 42:17.178
had a job at McDonald's as long as Harlan Smith had a 
job at McDonald's. And indeed, he would let

42:17.198 --> 42:20.582
himself go before he would let Bob Tull go. And 
that's the way it happened. How important has Bob

42:23.872 --> 42:28.879
been to astronomy at UT? Crucial. Absolutely 
crucial. Because our history through the 70s and

42:30.902 --> 42:42.200
80s was based on our excellence in coup de 
spectroscopy. And that excellence was built by a

42:42.961 --> 42:45.165
number of different people. For example, David 
Lambert, who was clearly one of the finest

42:50.819 --> 42:56.005
observational astronomers in the world, doing 
two-day spectroscopy. But his success was built

42:56.085 --> 43:00.630
on the foundation that Bob Tall built. And if Bob 
Tall had not been there, MacDonald wouldn't be

43:00.650 --> 43:09.479
one-half, one-third what it is today in terms of 
recognition throughout the astronomical

43:00.650 --> 43:09.479
community. He was absolutely crucial.

43:13.804 --> 43:15.105
Do you think that the... the last minute uh 
decision to you know strike out the 300 inch you

43:17.077 --> 43:37.212
know the last hour of the legislation you think 
that took a lot of steam out of harlem yeah it did um

43:17.077 --> 43:37.212
during that period of time that's all harlem did 
was uh was the 300-inch telescope and uh when when

43:38.879 --> 44:08.025
it was lying the primary mirror money was lined out 
of the state budget because of the oil crisis it set

43:38.879 --> 44:08.025
us back from a project that was on its way to 
probable success i won't say certainty probable

43:38.879 --> 44:08.025
success to a project that was most likely not going 
to happen and harlan didn't really recognize that

43:38.879 --> 44:08.025
for a little while he kept pushing it really hard 
And as late as the year when Bill Cunningham became

44:08.512 --> 44:21.408
president, changing over from Pete Flong, I 
forget what year that was. It was probably 86 or 87.

44:25.313 --> 44:35.245
We had a breakfast meeting, Harlan and I and key 
members of the Board of Visitors, with Bill

44:25.313 --> 44:35.245
Cunningham right early on in his tenure as 
president. brought up the 300 inch telescope and

44:36.288 --> 44:45.877
Bill looked him straight in the eye and said quite 
loudly to the whole table, he said, Harlan, the 300

44:36.288 --> 44:45.877
inch telescope is dead. Forget it. And I think that 
was when it really became clear to Harlan that it

44:48.800 --> 44:53.885
was over with. Did the torpedoing of the 300 inch 
have any effect on the general faculty and staff at

44:53.905 --> 45:00.292
McDonald's? I mean, were you guys in a dump, sir? 
Yeah, I think there were several years where We

45:05.093 --> 45:10.923
were kind of at a loss because it was obvious that we 
needed more big telescopes. It had been obvious

45:10.963 --> 45:23.203
for about 10 years from 1978 that we needed big 
telescopes, another big telescope, and yet we had

45:10.963 --> 45:23.203
no realistic possibility of getting one in the 
near term. So that there was a period of time where

45:23.892 --> 45:27.257
people were very upset. We almost lost David 
Lambert to Ohio State on the basis of the Columbus

45:27.537 --> 45:34.006
Project and their involvement in Columbus. It was 
nip and tuck, and he ended up staying. But I

45:37.331 --> 45:44.561
attribute the fact that he was interested in 
leaving to this climate that we were living in at

45:37.331 --> 45:44.561
that time. But Holland did what... what he'd 
always done he proceeded to move on many fronts at

45:49.002 --> 46:16.309
once and i and i agreed with him at that time on this 
that we tried to get involved with the sophia

45:49.002 --> 46:16.309
project using our connections uh through paul 
harvey and through uh hans mark we moved on the

45:49.002 --> 46:16.309
spectroscopic survey telescope through our 
connection with dan weedman at kent state and

45:49.002 --> 46:16.309
there were several other projects that were 
thought to be worthy of pursuit that were explored

46:16.863 --> 46:42.921
and one by one they fell out they didn't happen we we 
didn't get involved except for the ssc inspector

46:16.863 --> 46:42.921
scott survey teller and that one is now going to 
come to pass um one last question uh the 107 inch

46:16.863 --> 46:42.921
westinghouse was a fiasco as far as the mechanical 
operation of the telescope i well know that Do you

46:43.255 --> 46:50.943
think that has colored the attitude of the UT 
administration towards the SST, Spectroscopic

46:43.255 --> 46:50.943
Survey Telescope? Yes. The history of the UT 
administration with respect to McDonald

46:51.764 --> 47:10.663
Observatory has been that we consistently, from 
their view, we consistently either lie to them

46:51.764 --> 47:10.663
about how much it's going to cost or are 
incompetent to figure out how much it costs.
