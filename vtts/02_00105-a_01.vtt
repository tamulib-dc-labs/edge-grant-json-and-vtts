This is Tuesday, Tuesday testing. okay I hope you

00:29.798 --> 00:45.681
can hear me if I talk about this same level this is 
this is Tuesday February 7 I believe it is and we're

00:29.798 --> 00:45.681
in the Clayton Williams building and I have the 
honor and pleasure of chatting with buck

00:46.302 --> 01:14.082
henderson about his a m years but to begin with 
describe your life before you enrolled here

00:46.302 --> 01:14.082
family where what did they do for a living where'd 
you grow up where'd you go to high school give us a

00:46.302 --> 01:14.082
biography before you got here as a fish yes sir uh 
started i was born in 1940 and Jacksboro, Texas,

01:14.483 --> 01:18.488
which is located between Fort Worth and Wichita 
Falls. I guess you'd call it a small, ranching, oil

01:20.070 --> 01:23.915
field community. And like most of the kids that I 
graduated with in 1958, we went from the first

01:24.816 --> 01:42.499
grade through high school together and grew up 
from that standpoint of you had to be very careful

01:24.816 --> 01:42.499
what you did and how you treated people because you 
had to live with that all your life. And I guess my

01:42.935 --> 01:51.750
emphasis was I was in the Scouts until I was 18 years 
old. I think the main reason I stayed in the Scouts

01:51.790 --> 01:55.776
was because we ushered all the TCU football games. 
So for seven years, I never missed a Saturday when

01:56.457 --> 01:59.863
there was a home game at TCU. We were 60 miles away. 
My emphasis in high school, I guess, was sports. I

02:07.305 --> 02:13.674
played football, basketball, golf, and tennis, 
and wasn't any good in any of them, but in a small

02:07.305 --> 02:13.674
town you got to play. My weakness was academics. My 
mother died when I was very young. I was raised by my

02:20.142 --> 02:21.644
grandmother. My father was a rancher, and so I was 
pretty well Raised as I say by my grandmother and my

02:26.573 --> 02:47.923
aunt who stayed after my mother died the eighth 
grade until I graduated and so I was a young man who

02:26.573 --> 02:47.923
probably got out of the door of high school because 
My two toughest subjects my teacher had also

02:26.573 --> 02:47.923
taught or my teachers had taught my father so I That 
kind of sums it up. How many in the senior class? In

02:51.317 --> 02:58.616
senior class, we had 60, of which Texas A&M was an 
all-boys class, I mean an all-boys school. I think

02:58.676 --> 03:05.473
we had 31 boys, and we had six of those 30 that 
started A&M. Five of us graduated, which was

03:05.825 --> 03:08.489
unbelievable. The one that didn't graduate left 
the first week and went to Texas Tech and graduated

03:08.529 --> 03:14.817
from there. So again,

03:14.917 --> 03:22.167
when I came to A&M that year, they had made the Corps 
compulsory. And so of those five that stayed, two

03:22.948 --> 03:33.402
had handicap-type

03:22.948 --> 03:33.402
problems, which they didn't have to be in the 
Corps. Why did you come to A&M? Why here instead of

03:36.019 --> 03:37.400
some other place? I think there were two reasons. 
One of the reasons was I mentioned the football

03:39.923 --> 03:44.988
game at a TCU football game. I believe it was 
probably 1952, 53. A&M was playing TCU that day,

03:46.249 --> 03:55.458
and A&M may have only won three games that year. But 
a quarterback by the name of Don Ellis ran wild. He

04:00.010 --> 04:10.526
was All-Southwest Conference quarterback, I 
remember, or I'm pretty sure he was, but he put on a

04:00.010 --> 04:10.526
one-man show, and they upset TCU. I took my little 
autograph book, which I had, and took it down to the

04:11.127 --> 04:26.271
dressing room, and one of the trainers took me in, 
and I got to meet the quarterback, and he put, best

04:11.127 --> 04:26.271
wishes, Don Ellis to Quincy, Louisiana, and I've 
been fortunate enough in recent years to get to

04:26.791 --> 04:36.424
know Colonel Ellis, and I think that had probably 
the start of my looking towards A&M. The second

04:37.526 --> 04:54.469
reason was the guy that pretty well was my 
godfather was Henry Richards, class of 41, and I

04:37.526 --> 04:54.469
caddied for him for about six years, and he used to 
bring four of us down here for the football game,

04:37.526 --> 04:54.469
actually bring five, sometimes because he had six 
tickets, and he'd bring us to the games. We'd get

04:59.743 --> 05:11.105
home late on those Saturday nights after the game, 
but he kept never pushing, but he was a role model in

04:59.743 --> 05:11.105
our little community. So you came a number of times 
to the campus. I came probably to When I was in high

05:18.445 --> 05:23.891
school, I probably came down here for I'd say six 
football games. The first one that I came to was

05:24.932 --> 05:43.250
that famous TCU rain game where A&M won seven to six 
when Swink was playing for TCU and Crow and Lloyd

05:24.932 --> 05:43.250
Taylor kicked that extra point in the 100-hour 
windstorm, all of that. The tornado hit outside

05:43.811 --> 05:45.853
Bryan that day. Now, I'm assuming that you are not 
from a family of old education, like I'm not

05:46.053 --> 05:51.199
either. No. What caused you to think that you had a 
chance to go to college? Well, I think I grew up and

05:56.865 --> 06:03.011
just assumed that I would always go. Both of my two 
older sisters went, and neither one of them

06:03.051 --> 06:05.714
finished. They went to TCU, and after a couple of 
years, one transferred to North Texas, but they

06:05.734 --> 06:11.961
never completed their degrees. They went on to 
work. I just, because of, I think, Mr. Richards,

06:14.453 --> 06:39.600
Henry Richards, who I'm still very close with, who 
has also been a very good supporter of the A&M golf

06:14.453 --> 06:39.600
team, I think I came here and just figured, well, 
Jacksonboro was probably a pretty well-to-do

06:14.453 --> 06:39.600
town per capita because of all of the oil and 
everything, and I just... I always knew I was going

06:40.930 --> 06:50.682
to come, but in the back of my mind, I was always 
worried that could I make it because, as I said, I

06:40.930 --> 06:50.682
really got out the door of high school barely. What 
had impressed you about A&M before you came to them

06:50.942 --> 06:55.148
all? I think one of the things, as I mentioned, I'd 
been in the Boy Scouts for all those years, and I

06:55.168 --> 07:10.887
think you look in the Scouts, something about 
discipline, and you look at possibility for

06:55.168 --> 07:10.887
leadership because you work your way up. and then 
also helping other people. And then you go back and

07:13.728 --> 07:15.651
you looked at A&M. I think if I'd been from a big city 
and had come down here, I don't know if I would have

07:16.973 --> 07:21.880
looked favorably on it. I looked at this as just 
kind of a neat experience because the bottom line,

07:29.227 --> 07:32.470
Everybody was basically the same in your class, 
you know.

07:35.773 --> 07:38.456
There wasn't a fish camp then, was there? There was 
not a fish camp, but it kind of makes it sound like I

07:38.756 --> 07:46.044
wasn't a very good student the way I've led into 
this so far. But I will be very honest, my senior

07:46.124 --> 07:54.492
year I saw that I had to have chemistry and I had to 
have plain geometry to get into Texas A&M. And I

07:54.775 --> 07:58.899
made a 70 in chemistry, and you can guess what I made 
in plain geometry, a 70. So I knew that I had a very

07:58.979 --> 08:08.147
weak background in the training for academics. So 
the bottom line was I had the opportunity to go to

08:08.167 --> 08:18.356
Junction that summer, which was for students that 
wanted to go to work on some of their academic

08:08.167 --> 08:18.356
skills. And so I chose to go, and I did go one 
semester at Junction. And I think that definitely

08:22.120 --> 08:24.782
helped me because They did emphasize study hall, 
and they had help sessions, and then I came. Of

08:31.093 --> 08:49.926
course, I'll go a step further and say when I got 
here, they also had something called the basic

08:31.093 --> 08:49.926
division, which I took advantage of, and again, I 
think I knew, and maybe the good thing, I knew that I

08:31.093 --> 08:49.926
had some weaknesses. describe the junction annex 
and as far as you know about how long had it been

08:49.906 --> 09:05.923
going i'm i'm really not sure i think it'd been 
going in maybe a different type of environment

08:49.906 --> 09:05.923
prior to becoming a a I guess you'd say an academic 
enhancement program for incoming freshmen. You

09:12.447 --> 09:12.888
went out there. It was tough. You took normally 
seven hours of PE and two other classes. And I

09:19.120 --> 09:24.992
remember that we lived in tents. And to me, it was 
just like scout camp all over again. And you did it

09:28.096 --> 09:30.860
alphabetically. And some of those guys that I got 
to know there are still ones that you are involved

09:31.000 --> 09:38.969
with today. Such as? Such as, I'll take Bo Martin is 
a very good friend of mine now in Dallas.

09:52.040 --> 09:57.429
I think probably the thing that I learned right 
there, well, I'll give you an example. There is a

09:58.431 --> 10:08.648
gentleman here that

09:58.431 --> 10:08.648
I still, you might want to stop in just one second, I 
see. I'll think of Eddie's name in a second, and

10:10.113 --> 10:15.158
then you'll really see how bad I am. But he's moved 
back to Bryan the other day, and the first thing he

10:15.178 --> 10:22.565
did, he came up to me and he said, now I get a chance to 
beat you. And so I asked him, what do you mean? He

10:24.107 --> 10:31.754
said, well, you won the intramural ping pong out 
there, and I was runner up, and you beat me three to

10:24.107 --> 10:31.754
two. And I said, well, I don't remember any of that. 
But I think, again, it's just one of those moments

10:38.699 --> 10:40.661
areas where you get to meet a lot of people. I bought 
a car from Gerald Headings a few years ago that

10:40.701 --> 10:47.267
lives up about 30 miles out of Dallas. And we shared 
bunks with each other. And so you could probably

10:50.390 --> 10:53.974
name 15 different guys that you've had. Were there 
some teachers you recall positively from that

10:54.935 --> 10:59.859
time? Mr. Perry, I remember, was very, very 
outstanding that I had him in math. I just thought

11:06.374 --> 11:09.960
that was excellent. What was the other course you 
had? I had English. Both of them, I believe, were

11:12.504 --> 11:15.970
Dr. Perry and Dr. Kane. And PE was just a general 
one-hour conditioning class. it was uh very tough

11:23.114 --> 11:51.450
and i think probably it was very good for me for one 
reason uh it was structured and uh you know you can

11:23.114 --> 11:51.450
go back and read the junction boys and you you see 
how structured it was well it was pretty

11:23.114 --> 11:51.450
structured on us out there too and we had lights out 
and uh there's certain things that we were able to

11:23.114 --> 11:51.450
do describe the typical a day the typical day was 
we'd get up in the in the morning seemed like we had

11:23.114 --> 11:51.450
to whistle jock same as we had in the core and this 
was all good training for the core And then we'd

11:51.768 --> 11:57.196
have to be up, we'd go to breakfast, and we were 
expected to keep our tents clean. We didn't have

11:57.216 --> 11:59.419
inspections and things like that. And probably 
one of the things I remember most, you'd go to

12:00.100 --> 12:07.411
breakfast, and then you had three classes during 
the day. And a lot of emphasis was put on academics,

12:08.092 --> 12:16.324
so it did mean that the studying that night, the 
tents, you had to keep the noise level down. And

12:21.350 --> 12:25.738
quite interesting because it was pretty warm down 
there on a summer night. But it was a good

12:26.680 --> 12:34.195
adjustment for coming into, which was a very big 
shock for me, entering the Corps of Cadets and

12:34.681 --> 12:40.208
being a fish because I was not prepared for that at 
all. And you see that, as you look back on it, as a

12:41.310 --> 12:48.759
positive preparation for you? Oh, definitely. 
Definitely. Because I think, number one, a lot of

12:50.361 --> 12:54.867
people had never had to, maybe they didn't have a 
brother, maybe they came from families that had

12:55.488 --> 13:00.839
money also. In other words, they'd never had tight 
living conditions as such. Sure, you go to church

13:04.346 --> 13:15.609
camp or you'd go to, as I mentioned earlier, scout 
camp, but it was usually never where you would have

13:04.346 --> 13:15.609
maybe 16 guys in one tent. So it was a peer pressure 
because you always had, I came from being very,

13:17.392 --> 13:27.066
very reserved, and we had some pretty what I 
considered Hollywood loudmouths there. What did

13:27.687 --> 13:33.616
you and the other junction, did you all have a name 
for the group? Were you junction kids or junction?

13:35.719 --> 13:40.767
I don't know, I just always remember just the 
junction adjunct, it was called the adjunct

13:35.719 --> 13:40.767
there, but I don't remember us having him. Some 
people would laugh about it and say, hey, we're the

13:43.670 --> 13:54.082
dumb kids, you know, that are trying to improve, 
but we'd all already been admitted to Texas A&M,

13:43.670 --> 13:54.082
and there was no requirement to come. And some of 
the, of course, some of the people that came were in

13:54.142 --> 14:03.112
the tops of their high school class and definitely 
went on to bigger and better things. What did you

14:03.693 --> 14:04.894
all do for fun? Well, I think... know you get down 
there down the little river there and you go

14:08.017 --> 14:35.155
swimming we uh it seemed like most of the time that i 
remember most of it was geared towards just

14:08.017 --> 14:35.155
surviving in school because i think probably the 
thing that helped me was they they made a very very

14:08.017 --> 14:35.155
very big push on keeping you busy very very busy you 
had lots of homework no matter which of the classes

14:08.017 --> 14:35.155
you were taking you had papers like english it 
seemed like you never got One paper finished that

14:35.287 --> 14:37.932
there wasn't another one that was due. And I 
remember going Saturday night so we could go in. I

14:44.624 --> 14:46.628
would go to church on Sunday in Junction. Seemed 
like Junction may have been, I don't know, three

14:47.108 --> 14:50.314
miles away. I don't remember how far it was. I 
remember we walked one time, but I remember going

14:51.777 --> 14:56.265
one night to the rodeo and And I was a Western music, 
country music fan, and that's the first time I'd

14:56.870 --> 15:02.617
ever seen Jimmy Heap in the Melody Masters. So I 
remember that. And I had grown up around rodeos, so

15:04.860 --> 15:10.788
you would, those dances out there on the old tennis 
court or whatever. But for some reason, I

15:11.128 --> 15:14.673
definitely remember that night. But there was no 
real wild partying on Saturday night. I think I

15:18.197 --> 15:23.524
came out from maybe a little different 
environment from a lot of kids. I came from a

15:23.624 --> 15:25.206
pretty... pretty conservative life, even though 
I hung around rodeos, and sure I would, the typical

15:25.388 --> 15:39.869
kid that would go out and drink, but I was not what 
you'd, as far as drinking beer, but I was not a

15:25.388 --> 15:39.869
partier, you know, from that standpoint, you 
know. Now, I've heard lots of the stories of the

15:40.811 --> 15:48.342
guys that would go out, and I was shy, S-H-Y with a 
capital, S-H-Y. All right, so you went six weeks,

15:49.182 --> 15:51.625
then went home. Went home. I could have stayed for 
the 12, but I figured, you know, I was ready to get.

15:56.972 --> 16:03.801
And I worked five summers in the oil field, and I 
came back and worked those second six weeks. Then

16:05.503 --> 16:09.348
when you came to the campus to enroll, how did you 
get here? I got a ride with one of those six of us from

16:09.969 --> 16:15.055
Jacksboro, a gentleman named Bill Sparks. I 
remember it. very well. I had one footlocker. I got

16:18.512 --> 16:21.135
off over there in front of Dorm 2. That's Briggs 
Hall. And the guardroom, the Corps Staff

16:23.177 --> 16:26.540
guardroom was there. Put my footlocker down 
there. And all of a sudden, a guy named Bill Reagan

16:29.483 --> 16:39.874
was the first sergeant, this guy that looked very 
sharp and had khakis on starch. And he said,

16:39.894 --> 16:42.677
anybody here in A Veterinary Company? And And I was 
going to be in a veterinary company, so I got there

16:43.570 --> 16:49.478
just in time to leave my footlocker there. And I 
joined in, and we marched over to Sully. And as he

16:54.845 --> 16:59.231
said, we were the first unit in 58 to polish Sully. 
And I remember that very well, because I had a

17:00.092 --> 17:02.575
yellow. polo golf shirt and a pair of black slacks, 
and I ruined both of them. But we were the first unit

17:07.083 --> 17:10.006
to polish Sully that day. Now, how did you get 
assigned to that unit? There was a guy, class of 58,

17:13.369 --> 17:18.675
that brought us down the year before. He was here, 
and we came down, and he was rooming with a guy named

17:18.695 --> 17:25.782
Jerry Gleason, and they had just formed the 
veterinary company. I might say that... The first

17:28.998 --> 17:38.309
year I was here at Texas A&M 58 to 59 was the last year 
that they had branch training in the ROTC as far as

17:28.998 --> 17:38.309
the Army. They did have Air Force and Army ROTC, but 
if you wanted to go into transportation,

17:39.130 --> 17:54.147
artillery, quartermaster, air defense, 
whatever, infantry, you basically went into

17:39.130 --> 17:54.147
those companies and you signed up for that. Well, I 
thought I wanted to be a veterinarian, and so I

17:55.610 --> 17:59.496
ended up in a veterinary company. And y'all were 
what? Dormitory two, fourth floor. And describe

18:04.743 --> 18:07.488
how you got it. How were you assigned a room? I was 
assigned a room, which was just like the rooms they

18:10.552 --> 18:16.701
have now, except we didn't have air conditioning. 
Air conditioning is And I'm sure this has been told

18:18.577 --> 18:26.808
1,000 times, but you would hope that the guy across 
the hall, the room would open their window, and

18:18.577 --> 18:26.808
you'd open your window, and maybe you'd get a 
little breeze. But I was assigned room 423. I

18:30.253 --> 18:32.275
remember that room well. I came back to teach ROTC 
here, and I remember going up to that room, dorm

18:32.356 --> 18:41.107
two, and two sophomores were in the room and went in 
there. And they were doing a biology project, and

18:41.328 --> 18:44.892
they had a fish in the sink. And I just thought that 
was very appropriate. That's Fish Henderson's

18:46.735 --> 18:48.297
room. I got ready to leave, and they said, sir, are 
you going to come back? And I said, well, I might

18:52.847 --> 18:54.929
drop in someday. Why? And he said, they said, well, 
if you are, we're going to change rooms with the

18:55.189 --> 18:58.373
freshmen. So I thought that was kind of humorous. 
But I was assigned a roommate. I had four roommates

19:03.359 --> 19:05.782
the first semester. Three of them left school 
before the semester was over. I ended up rooming

19:10.568 --> 19:14.453
the rest of my time with another freshman from Big 
Springs who did not have a penny, worked as a

19:14.990 --> 19:20.840
waiter. And later on, he ended up getting his PhD 
and teaching at a junior college. So I think that

19:27.170 --> 19:35.444
set the example of what A&M could do for people that 
were really, we wore the same clothes, ate the same

19:27.170 --> 19:35.444
food. But second semester, we roomed together the 
whole semester. Why did those others leave? I

19:44.751 --> 19:54.148
think the first one left the third week we were 
here, and I think he came from a completely

19:44.751 --> 19:54.148
different background than I did. He came down here 
in a new car and had been a partier, was from down

19:55.110 --> 20:01.281
near Baytown. And he just didn't like the 
structure we had of being a freshman. And you could

20:06.899 --> 20:09.742
call it harassment. Some people referred to it as 
hazing. Maybe another term could be good

20:12.025 --> 20:14.247
training. Another one just was definitely 
homesick. And I had gone to Philmont Scout Ranch

20:19.193 --> 20:21.335
with him. His father had been an assistant 
scoutmaster out of the Dallas area. And we had

20:25.480 --> 20:28.804
gotten a bus together from our council. 
interesting that he would come then end up being my

20:29.172 --> 20:53.914
roommate and he left and the third one he just after 
thanksgiving he was flunking everything and he

20:29.172 --> 20:53.914
was ready to go home i will tell you that i came down 
here and if i remember right i weighed i weighed 185

20:29.172 --> 20:53.914
pounds i thought i was six foot thought i was in 
pretty good shape and as i say i'd worked in the last

20:54.299 --> 21:12.240
six weeks in the oil field and I ended up at 
Thanksgiving I was flunking two courses and I

20:54.299 --> 21:12.240
weighed about 159 so I had quite a few views of going 
home also but but I had at least having gone to

20:54.299 --> 21:12.240
Junction I had made some extra grades and so What 
advice did your grandmother or anybody else in the

21:12.946 --> 21:23.980
family, what advice did anybody give you as you 
left home? I don't think I got any advice. I just

21:25.862 --> 21:37.857
came and since then, my father remarried when I was 
a senior in high school, and my stepmother has

21:25.862 --> 21:37.857
said, three or four times since that. And she came 
from a family that stressed education, and she had

21:40.762 --> 21:44.166
been a teacher. But she's always said that when I 
came home, I admitted to her that I was scared to

21:44.887 --> 21:54.018
death, and I didn't think I would make it. And since 
then, I've been fortunate enough to continue to go

21:54.078 --> 21:58.323
to school and many military schools. And I think 
I've done very well academically, but

21:58.343 --> 22:07.995
maybe I needed that hurdle to get over. Do you 
remember what that first year cost? What kind of

22:12.316 --> 22:13.338
financing? No, I don't really remember. I should, 
but... Did you pay part of it? I paid part of it, but

22:19.407 --> 22:22.452
my father pretty well covered it. It wasn't very 
expensive, though. I think one of the things that

22:24.214 --> 22:33.849
made it very reasonable back then was you could 
come here, our uniforms were furnished, all the

22:24.214 --> 22:33.849
clothes were furnished. I don't ever remember 
having a sports coat hanging in the closet until my

22:36.241 --> 22:42.070
senior year. Or feeling that you needed to. Didn't 
need it, no. I did, I will say, answer one of your

22:46.337 --> 22:49.842
questions. I came from, again, what I consider a 
small town where there's always lots of pressure.

22:56.953 --> 23:02.822
I did have 12 years perfect attendance in Sunday 
school when I started down here my freshman year.

23:02.903 --> 23:09.482
And I continued that until the Rice Corps trip in 
Houston, and it was the first time that I'd missed

23:02.903 --> 23:09.482
Sunday school. But I think my upbringing

23:09.722 --> 23:18.567
was such that right and wrong and respect for 
others, I hope. And your academic schedule, how

23:22.751 --> 23:28.985
did you, that first semester, did you... I looked 
in the catalog and it had a pre-vet curriculum with

23:29.166 --> 23:36.943
about 18 hours and You know, all I can say is it was a 
tough, tough go chemistry. Remember I mentioned

23:42.493 --> 23:44.937
earlier, that's one of them I made 70 in. Well, I 
wasn't for very... But the problem I had, the real

23:46.520 --> 23:56.017
problem that I had, and I have taught classes, 
freshmen, how to study and how to succeed in

23:46.520 --> 23:56.017
college, my biggest problem was two things. 
Number one, I think, is what... is preached to you

23:57.713 --> 24:25.695
today and it's still true is is I didn't know how to 
study didn't have any idea how to study I would sit

23:57.713 --> 24:25.695
in class and daydream you know or something and the 
second is I had no concept of managing my time even

23:57.713 --> 24:25.695
though maybe what I did learn in the scouts helped 
me more than I thought but but I was very very ill

23:57.713 --> 24:25.695
prepared because I fit into the core the mold of the 
core where all of a sudden whatever that sophomore

24:25.827 --> 24:30.533
wanted me to do or whatever became more important 
than the school work. As you look back, are there

24:31.234 --> 24:37.022
some teachers from that first year or so that were 
important or advisors? I think the basic

24:38.003 --> 24:48.196
division, Mr. Curley was a shining example of 
help, and I had him later in graduate school as a

24:38.003 --> 24:48.196
professor. I think Most of my help from 
professors, though, really started my junior

24:51.950 --> 24:56.678
year. Because the first two years, it seemed like I 
was more just in the core style life here. And I

25:05.111 --> 25:08.256
didn't really turn for help. I just played the 
game. I think, as somebody asked me one time, what

25:10.379 --> 25:14.446
did I major in? And our mutual friend, we were 
sitting at the Shamrock when I came in in 67 for the

25:18.663 --> 25:22.129
Rice game. And in fact, Bones Irwin asked me, said, 
at that time, I think I was a captain. He said,

25:27.038 --> 25:28.560
Captain Henderson, what did you major in? And your 
friend McCandless said, freshman chemistry,

25:28.620 --> 25:34.471
which was a little bit of truth. Because the first 
two years, I didn't know. All right, but that first

25:37.276 --> 25:39.659
semester, did you pass everything? No. 
Chemistry, went down in chemistry, and that was a

25:40.981 --> 25:44.665
four-hour course. And so I... Who taught, do you 
remember who taught it then? Alexander. Did he

25:51.594 --> 25:52.415
have a nickname? I'm not sure that he had a 
nickname, but most of the other professors did.

26:00.563 --> 26:02.525
I had Alexander more than once. In fact, Sally and I 
stopped in an antique store the other day, and the

26:05.228 --> 26:14.438
lady there got to talking about her 
brother-in-law. I was from A&M, and did I know a Dr.

26:14.458 --> 26:17.541
Alexander? I said, yes, I did. You're doing quite 
well. That's where I stopped the conversation.

26:21.906 --> 26:22.566
Nice guy. But we were also in chemistry, which was a 
shock. That was the big class that I was in where,

26:28.323 --> 26:34.543
you know, my goodness, you had so many. And then lab 
was very demanding, and I'm going to quit talking

26:34.563 --> 26:40.442
about how I wasn't prepared because... As I say, it 
took me a little while, and then I think I finally

26:40.557 --> 26:43.743
got over that.

26:48.272 --> 26:57.890
Your first days as a fish, describe the dormitory 
life, the routine, if there was hazing or whatever

26:48.272 --> 26:57.890
it might be called. Well, I was in a good unit, a 
veterinary company. I was fortunate enough to be

27:01.837 --> 27:12.493
the guy later on to be responsible, basically, I 
guess, for overseeing the building and then

27:01.837 --> 27:12.493
running of the Core Center. And one of the first 
things I did when we put the guidons around, and you

27:12.573 --> 27:24.350
see them now inside the Core Center, is right 
outside my door is hanging a veterinary guidon,

27:12.573 --> 27:24.350
which is a replica of it. But it was a good unit, a lot 
of good memories. Most of the guys there. had no

27:30.912 --> 27:33.175
intentions of being in the Corps. In 1958, they 
made the Corps compulsory again, so Ben's the only

27:34.277 --> 27:42.287
vet school for three states at that time, if I 
remember right. We had a lot of guys from as far away

27:43.088 --> 27:55.485
as Parrington, all over, having to take a pre-vet, 
which was a three-year program. They had no

27:56.292 --> 27:58.336
intentions of being in the Corps of Cadets. But 
they got down here and found out if they were going

27:58.356 --> 28:01.462
to be at A&M, they had to be in the Corps of Cadets. So 
that year, it was kind of interesting. We had

28:06.451 --> 28:13.404
probably 20 sophomores and probably started off 
with 70-something freshmen. So we were different

28:13.444 --> 28:16.950
than all of the other units. In fact, the next year, 
they came up with two units, two vet units, because

28:17.015 --> 28:29.388
you had more students than you could actually 
manage from the leadership role and accomplish

28:17.015 --> 28:29.388
anything, I think. So I was in a good unit from the 
standpoint of

28:29.828 --> 28:40.560
not having, let's say, two sophomores that were on 
my back. Sure, I had sophomores that were on my back

28:40.580 --> 28:43.883
or whatever. It wasn't just, they also had about 
six other freshmen that each sophomore was

28:44.318 --> 28:50.352
involved with. You didn't mention any juniors or 
seniors. Sat on a table with Ted Harwood. who's a

28:56.671 --> 28:59.955
veterinarian now in San Antonio. And he was a 
pretty strict guy, but I can remember him very

29:00.035 --> 29:06.524
well. In fact, I was very fortunate. This past 
year, I got to speak at the reunion for the class of

29:10.349 --> 29:13.614
60. And I'm really looking forward to next year 
talking to the class of 61, who was the class that

29:18.845 --> 29:22.435
was sophomores when I was a freshman. But we had 
most of the people that were in their sophomore

29:22.475 --> 29:30.897
year in a veterinary company We're trying to get 
into vet school, so grades were emphasized. I had

29:34.082 --> 29:37.226
lots of fish buddies that told so many war stories. 
We thought we had it very tough. As I said, I lost a

29:39.709 --> 29:41.111
lot of weight. I think a lot of that was coming from 
worrying a lot. But I got along with, I think,

29:50.283 --> 29:53.546
upperclassmen from the standpoint I was very 
active in intramurals. I played a number of sports

29:53.586 --> 30:19.851
and back then intramurals was very, very 
important and which was probably the turning

29:53.586 --> 30:19.851
point in my career at A&M because I ended up being a 
sophomore intramural manager and a junior and

29:53.586 --> 30:19.851
then there was four senior intramural managers 
for the entire campus and I was one of those and so

29:53.586 --> 30:19.851
that was probably what my real interest was and 
still even though I graduated, I never really put

30:21.451 --> 30:25.045
much emphasis on academics. Did you all have less, 
in effect, less of the core traditions that first

30:33.027 --> 30:34.028
year or so. Oh, yes. I'd hate to admit it to anybody 
that was in my outfit, but we didn't catch as much,

30:34.969 --> 30:44.378
pardon the expression, the old Army hell. Oh, 
sure, I stayed up all night polishing floors or

30:44.838 --> 30:50.344
things like that. But I can truthfully say that 
nobody ever took a board to me. I'm going out to eat

30:57.190 --> 31:02.055
this Friday night with probably my best friend now 
out of my class. He was put down, he was in the

31:02.137 --> 31:16.634
medical company, which was on the third floor, but 
he was put down next to an Italian staff and was a

31:02.137 --> 31:16.634
freshman for two juniors, which I better not 
mention their name because you'd know both of them

31:02.137 --> 31:16.634
here around A&M now still. But he had...
