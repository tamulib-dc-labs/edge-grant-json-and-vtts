WEBVTT

00:02.343 --> 00:08.149
who has been with the College of Education since 
before it was a college of education. And he's

00:08.910 --> 00:21.902
going to share some of his perceptions of things 
that have occurred and changes that have come

00:08.910 --> 00:21.902
about in the college, and what might have created 
some of them, and where we are, where we might be

00:08.910 --> 00:21.902
going. So starting with the beginning, you came? I 
came

00:24.765 --> 00:30.551
to A&M in 1961. OK. as a counselor in the Counseling 
Testing Service and a part-time assistant

00:32.110 --> 00:53.480
professor of psychology in the then Department of 
Education and Psychology, as it was known at that

00:32.110 --> 00:53.480
time. I taught part-time there until 1969.

01:03.734 --> 01:20.492
when the College of Education was formed out of the 
Department of Education, the departments, Ag

01:03.734 --> 01:20.492
Education, Industrial Education, Health and 
Physical Education, curriculum instruction and

01:03.734 --> 01:20.492
stuff like that. And I became an associate 
professor of educational psychology at that time

01:21.753 --> 01:32.425
and associate dean of the new college. under W.R. 
Hubert. What were your duties as Associate Dean?

01:40.506 --> 01:45.751
Associate Dean for Student Personnel Services. 
Is that what Brian Cole is right now? That's right.

01:50.635 --> 01:52.197
And Dr. Limbacher was? Dr. Limbacher was that 
before him. And then you were before Limbacher? I

01:57.441 --> 01:58.282
was the first one, yeah. And I was that for two 
years.

02:02.425 --> 02:21.613
But

02:02.425 --> 02:21.613
I wrote the proposal for the, I should say I 
finished writing the proposal presented to the

02:02.425 --> 02:21.613
Coordinating Board in Austin for formation of the 
College of Education. Oh, I see. I have a copy of

02:23.276 --> 02:26.661
that. The proposal. And I presented it. It all 
happened pretty fast. It wasn't a long drawn out

02:29.345 --> 02:31.428
thing, right? Right. Dean Frank W.R. Hubert in 
1961 was dean of the College of Arts and Science,

02:32.851 --> 02:43.101
Texas A&M University. And then he split off from 
that college, the College of Business, the

02:43.121 --> 03:00.799
College of Science, the College of Geoscience,

02:43.121 --> 03:00.799
the College of Liberal Arts, and the College of 
Education. One by one, he split those away, and of

03:02.213 --> 03:23.609
course he, being an educator, chose to keep the 
College of

03:02.213 --> 03:23.609
Education.

03:23.629 --> 03:28.137
It changed and happened as the college began to 
evolve. Always, though, the mission has still

03:28.589 --> 03:32.877
remained the teaching, the research, and the 
service. In your opinion, has that changed

03:33.358 --> 03:42.614
drastically in focus from the Hubert era to the 
Corrigan era or in between? No, I don't think it's

03:42.654 --> 03:45.860
changed. Our emphasis on the preparation of 
teachers still has always been there.

03:57.226 --> 04:02.211
Search and service has been carried on in many 
different ways. There was a laboratory for human

04:04.553 --> 04:15.364
learning in the Department of Education and 
Psychology which moved over to the Department of

04:04.553 --> 04:15.364
Psychology. There was a human learning 
laboratory which was and still is over in the of

04:25.762 --> 04:27.304
health and physical education. Of course, that 
emphasis was on physical performance instead of

04:28.465 --> 04:38.337
intellectual performance of students. I don't

04:38.897 --> 04:42.982
know what else. Now, go ahead. OK. One of the things 
that I have been talking about with different

04:43.583 --> 04:54.756
department people is how this growth and these 
changes have affected your ability to work with

04:43.583 --> 04:54.756
students. In graduate programs, it's not as 
pronounced as it is in the undergraduate level as

04:54.989 --> 05:05.061
far as the growth, because this department has 
been pretty stable as far as growth, right? I mean,

05:05.121 --> 05:09.907
there's a limit to the growth here in this 
department, whereas there is not that in some

05:05.121 --> 05:09.907
others. Well, within this department now, when 
you get off the College of Education and begin to

05:09.927 --> 05:19.038
talk about the department itself, there have been 
some rather drastic changes. At one time, we spent

05:19.939 --> 05:23.123
about 90% of our time in terms of courses and 
professors preparing people to be special

05:24.048 --> 05:38.610
education

05:24.048 --> 05:38.610
chief counselors and school counselors. Later 
they added school psychologists to the

05:40.092 --> 05:52.992
preparation, but the preparation of school 
counselors has decreased over the years.

05:53.613 --> 05:58.858
probably less than 10% of our department is 
concerned with preparation of school

05:53.613 --> 05:58.858
counselors. And we are now concerned with the 
preparation of school psychologists, special

05:59.579 --> 06:20.278
education teachers, and independently 
practicing psychologists and researchers at the

05:59.579 --> 06:20.278
PhD level.

06:20.545 --> 06:25.652
This has been a change from the early days when we 
were almost all school counseling. Do you see a lot

06:26.533 --> 06:34.804
of collaboration, or has there been a lot of 
collaboration, not only within the department,

06:26.533 --> 06:34.804
but among departments in the college? Well, we've 
always had some joint appointments. Several

06:38.770 --> 06:43.656
people had joint appointments between 
curriculum instruction and educational

06:38.770 --> 06:43.656
psychology. We now have joint appointments with 
the Student Counseling Service and the

06:48.187 --> 06:56.979
Department of Educational Psychology. And we now 
have some... By joint appointments? Not exactly

07:03.387 --> 07:04.749
joint appointments. Both people are listed as 
adjunct

07:04.809 --> 07:11.798
professors. Some that are working in the 
counseling? They're working full-time in the

07:14.304 --> 07:17.988
student counseling service, but they teach a 
course for us. Oh, I see. OK. And likewise, with a

07:18.949 --> 07:26.438
couple of local psychiatrists who are listed as 
adjunct professors in the department. We've

07:26.538 --> 07:27.980
never had that before. And we now have that where 
we'll have people off campus doing work with

07:29.201 --> 07:39.793
campus in terms of research and service.

07:40.786 --> 07:48.375
If you're talking about the department also, then 
you'd have to talk about one major aspect of it,

07:40.786 --> 07:48.375
which is the Student Counseling Service. I don't

07:48.395 --> 07:58.246
mean Student Counseling Service, I mean the 
Counseling and Assessment Clinic. We have here on

07:58.266 --> 08:01.790
the seventh floor in connection with the 
department. This is in effect a teaching

08:02.511 --> 08:09.679
laboratory, but one which takes referrals from 
physicians and counselors and psychologists and

08:10.216 --> 08:20.531
progression workers within 150 or 200 miles of 
campus for special workups. All of the work being

08:22.534 --> 08:35.793
done by our students and supervised by a licensed 
psychologist

08:22.534 --> 08:35.793
so that in effect it is a miniature mental health 
facility. When did that come about? It came about

08:39.106 --> 08:51.939
in 1972, I believe,

08:39.106 --> 08:51.939
and began to use the laboratory as it was set up in 
this building. This building was designed mostly

08:51.959 --> 08:59.666
by, I think, by Dean Hubert. And the teaching 
laboratories, the science teaching

09:00.307 --> 09:07.594
laboratories, counseling laboratories, 
reading laboratories, all designed into the

09:08.570 --> 09:18.764
basic building structure. And when we moved into 
the building

09:19.184 --> 09:31.100
in 1973, that's when the laboratory began. Where 
is that located, up here somewhere? On the seventh

09:34.505 --> 09:35.105
floor. Okay.

09:39.839 --> 09:47.829
Do you have some perceptions on how outsiders view 
the College of Education in general? Not just

09:47.969 --> 09:52.554
outsiders meaning the other colleges, but even 
beyond that. By outsiders you mean other

09:53.055 --> 09:56.979
professional educators or laymen? Other, well, 
either or both. Outside educators see it as a sort

10:03.948 --> 10:09.154
of a this kind of thing, because I think that it's a 
little bit harder to get into and to finish teacher

10:10.518 --> 10:30.262
training, counselor training, and whatever at 
this institution, which may be a reflection of the

10:10.518 --> 10:30.262
institution more than it is of the College of 
Education in particular. That's the way some

10:30.983 --> 10:34.206
professional people might see it. Lay people 
around the country, how do they see it?

10:41.804 --> 10:48.912
We have our practice teachers in all kinds of 
schools from Fort Worth to Houston. To San

10:48.932 --> 10:49.592
Antonio. And San Antonio. That doesn't 
particularly concern just the department here.

10:55.819 --> 10:58.322
It concerns the whole College of Education. There 
have been some efforts to do basic research

11:00.584 --> 11:08.773
through various school districts. from school 
districts that I'm aware of. We also taught some

11:14.500 --> 11:20.046
off-campus courses for years and we finally got 
out of this business. We taught off-campus

11:20.066 --> 11:30.556
courses in Galveston and San Tom and Houston and El 
Paso and Amarillo and Waco that I can remember

11:20.066 --> 11:30.556
right now. Why was that discontinued?

11:35.416 --> 11:46.768
For economic reasons and political reasons, as 
far as I can tell, they didn't want us competing

11:35.416 --> 11:46.768
unfairly with the local campuses there.

11:47.369 --> 11:58.901
I taught courses in Galveston where I traveled out 
one night a week and talked to teachers and others

11:47.369 --> 11:58.901
from the local school districts down there. I 
thought it was good educational experience for

11:58.921 --> 12:02.605
those people who wanted to get credit in this 
university, but they could not afford to travel up

12:03.091 --> 12:10.000
here.

12:11.521 --> 12:25.319
The argument against it was that they didn't have 
access to the library, and to a position with other

12:11.521 --> 12:25.319
professors and other graduate students. But I 
think this was overcome some by the fact that they

12:25.339 --> 12:32.828
were all professionals teaching in the field. And 
at the same time, they were getting a course. They

12:35.055 --> 12:41.801
were practicing their profession at the same 
time. OK. What about your crystal ball for the

12:41.821 --> 12:44.964
future? Do you have some? Well, let me mention one 
other community project.

12:52.811 --> 13:01.279
Three years ago, the Houston School District had a 
lack of Latin American counselors in the system.

13:04.064 --> 13:13.154
And there was a joint contract between HISD and the 
Department of Education and Psychology, College

13:04.064 --> 13:13.154
of Education, to prepare. And we took 24 classroom 
teachers and in two years time we gave them our

13:15.256 --> 13:24.967
counseling curriculum and everything. And the 
counselors finished our program here. The HISD

13:31.381 --> 13:37.390
paid a lot of their expenses. Books, tuition, 
stuff like that. So it has some minority

13:41.957 --> 13:47.966
counselors

13:41.957 --> 13:47.966
in the Houston system. All those people have 
upheld the high traditions of the department in

13:49.669 --> 14:00.105
terms of subsequent productivity, jobs, 
promotion, stuff like that. I was really an

14:00.828 --> 14:11.698
example of the kind of cooperation, I think, that a 
college or university campus can have on their

14:00.828 --> 14:11.698
local students. By the way, some of those courses 
were taught off campus. All the courses in San

14:16.002 --> 14:17.783
Antonio, myself? Yes. Okay. Do you think there's 
going to be great changes in the very near future? I

14:24.449 --> 14:28.413
know this new Bill 994 is going to affect a lot of the 
undergraduate teacher cooperation. How do you

14:28.993 --> 14:30.835
feel about that? What does the future bode for us? A 
few years back, they predicted a huge overage of

14:35.530 --> 14:48.547
teachers to be a false prediction because there 
was a shortage instead of an overage of teachers.

14:48.567 --> 14:59.000
Because not only did we hit the second generation 
of baby boomers, but because a lot of people in the

14:48.567 --> 14:59.000
teaching profession became disenchanted and 
left the teaching profession. So that's what

15:00.041 --> 15:02.104
caused the shortage in the the last three years. As 
we move into the era of smaller class size, not only

15:04.933 --> 15:23.112
at the elementary level, but at some of the upper 
levels, I think there will be more demand for

15:04.933 --> 15:23.112
teachers and counselors, especially education 
teachers. As you know, this department has an

15:23.133 --> 15:30.100
experimental program six years in length in which 
we prepare special education teachers who will

15:31.143 --> 15:53.135
finish the six years with a master's degree,

15:31.143 --> 15:53.135
certification, and one year's internship type 
experience in public schools. That's almost

15:53.796 --> 16:00.186
close to what the proposal is going to be for the new 
five year program. Yeah. Well, this will be a

16:00.657 --> 16:04.921
six-year program, and you'd have to go to Doug 
Palmer to get the full description of that. You

16:04.941 --> 16:06.883
already have it in place, or you're looking at it? 
No, it's in place. That's the only way we sign up,

16:08.865 --> 16:12.048
special education people. And you may want to talk 
to Dr. Palmer briefly about that, that special

16:12.068 --> 16:21.017
education program, that six-year program. Okay. 
All of them are in that six-year program, all

16:22.139 --> 16:24.881
special ed people then? All of them. We enroll from 
now on. Oh, from now on. From now on. Okay. We're

16:29.025 --> 16:30.647
getting the fall of it, 87. Okay. Dr. Hope, what 
about some of the highlights, and you've gone

16:33.934 --> 16:41.884
through a lot of things and a lot of changes and so 
forth, and you've contributed a lot. Can you share

16:42.745 --> 16:46.109
some insights or maybe an anecdote or two? What do 
you feel the best about what you've done since

16:46.710 --> 16:50.534
you've been at Texas A&M? Down through the years? 
Right. Well, when I was a part-time professor and a

16:53.358 --> 16:59.706
full-time counselor over in the Counseling and 
Testing Center, Mm-hmm. We were charged with

16:59.990 --> 17:13.167
doing the research which

16:59.990 --> 17:13.167
convinced the board and the constituents to 
become coeducational.

17:14.269 --> 17:26.525
We did a survey of the surrounding communities to 
find out how many women would come to Texas A&M if

17:14.269 --> 17:26.525
they had the opportunity and could not go anywhere 
else. Who gave you that charge? President Rutter.

17:30.533 --> 17:34.397
then President Rudder.

17:35.839 --> 17:54.340
We also, as a part of our work there, the research 
part of our work there, we were given the charge to

17:35.839 --> 17:54.340
examine the

17:35.839 --> 17:54.340
distribution of grants from the National Science 
Foundation to the various colleges and

17:35.839 --> 17:54.340
universities of the United States. And that study 
was taken to Washington by Congressman Teague and

18:00.031 --> 18:08.601
used to cause a lot more grants to come the way of 
Texas A&M. I'm talking now about science and

18:08.621 --> 18:11.685
technology. That study we did at President 
Rutter's request. One

18:17.992 --> 18:27.844
of the first things we did was initiate the use of 
the Scholastic Attitude Test for admission

18:17.992 --> 18:27.844
purposes to the university. That was my first job 
here in 1961, was to do a validating study of the SAT

18:28.685 --> 18:41.076
and the students in the university at that time. I 
think one of the most exciting things was that they

18:41.096 --> 18:58.050
predicted that as we raised our entrance 
requirements, that is, SAT and graduate school

18:41.096 --> 18:58.050
grade point ratio, that we would cut the size of the 
freshman class. Well, this happened for perhaps

19:02.701 --> 19:09.149
one year, maybe 1963. Then from then on, instead of 
having fewer students, we had more and more

19:09.229 --> 19:20.882
students of higher quality. Do you think that's 
going to continue now that we've raced it yet

19:21.048 --> 19:23.872
again? Yes, it will continue in my opinion. 
College of Business had the same experience with

19:27.156 --> 19:31.142
the GRE. And we were given the job also of 
administering the GRE to every graduating senior

19:31.162 --> 19:42.397
at A&M and doing a validation study for it. And it 
was this, and that was 1965, 4 or 5, somewhere along

19:43.298 --> 19:49.587
in there. We didn't even require the GRE for 
graduate school until much later than that. With

19:55.113 --> 20:09.473
that information, the president went out and 
began to beef up the departments that showed low

19:55.113 --> 20:09.473
scores on achievement. And he began to draw 
attention to those that had high scores on

20:09.493 --> 20:17.003
achievements. The president or the dean? The 
president. She

20:19.672 --> 20:36.472
asked me about the whole university, and that's 
why we didn't have a college of education in those

20:19.672 --> 20:36.472
days. That's true, that's right. You also worked, 
I'm dividing my study I think into the two eras, the

20:37.613 --> 20:45.662
Hubert era and the Corrigan era. Can you tell me a 
little bit about the the contrast in the two. I know

20:49.450 --> 20:56.141
there's been a lot, I mean, I've gotten a lot on the 
different leadership styles and so forth. Do you

20:56.161 --> 21:00.649
have any, you know, a certain observation on that? 
Dean Hubert seemed to keep his

21:02.492 --> 21:14.772
touch at all times to all facets of the college 
operation. This is not to say that he was not

21:15.983 --> 21:34.411
flexible in any way whatsoever, but he knew an 
awful lot about what was going on at a departmental

21:15.983 --> 21:34.411
level, and he took responsibility for directing 
some of that work. My perception of Dean Kurgan,

21:34.431 --> 21:45.467
while I wasn't in the office with Dean Kurgan,

21:34.431 --> 21:45.467
is that he is more likely to give a general charge to 
a department or a facet within the college of

21:46.696 --> 21:56.806
education and leave the execution of that to them. 
I would say that you'd have to say that both deans

21:56.826 --> 22:07.316
were intimately involved in the statewide scene. 
Frank Hubert, before he became dean of Texas A&M,

22:07.976 --> 22:14.863
was in the Texas Education Agency itself. had an 
intimate knowledge of the functioning inside

22:15.485 --> 22:19.751
that thing. After Dean Kurgan came, he was on the 
governor's select committee and he was deeply

22:19.771 --> 22:32.450
involved in the suggestions which led to the law. 
You'd have to say that Texas A&M, the deans of

22:33.392 --> 22:40.142
education for the past

22:41.523 --> 22:50.436
have been very active in the state scene about 
what's happening to education. Which has been

22:50.456 --> 22:54.221
beneficial to the College of Education office. 
Right. Okay. In closing, do you have any remarks or

22:55.563 --> 23:09.724
anything that you would be helpful in for me to kind 
of tie all those little ends together as to looking

22:55.563 --> 23:09.724
at the- The history of the College of Education. 
Well, if

23:10.210 --> 23:19.503
you went way back, you'd find that the first 
education courses were taught in ag education.

23:20.104 --> 23:22.247
You may be aware of that. The first psychology 
course was taught in 1916 in the department of

23:23.189 --> 23:31.701
rural sociology, I believe. And one considers 
that the first college courses in the whole United

23:33.323 --> 23:39.272
States were only taught We had a course here in 1916 
that indicated we had some forward looking

23:39.910 --> 23:49.804
people. Are you still full-time or are you 
semi-retired now? No, I'm taking early

23:54.091 --> 23:57.896
retirement and I'm what we call a half-time person 
now. I had 25 years, 26 years here and half-time in

23:58.237 --> 24:05.948
September. What are you doing with your other 
half-time? Oh, I work a little bit for Greenleaf

24:09.931 --> 24:24.306
Psychiatric Hospital, where we have a lot of our 
students and faculty working in the mental health

24:09.931 --> 24:24.306
area. And we do a lot of work there. Okay. That's an 
unofficial remark, of course. Well, I appreciate

24:33.776 --> 24:39.162
your time and your perceptions and your insights 
and you've made me aware of some things that I was

24:39.614 --> 24:45.279
not aware of as far as, you know, studies and things 
and how they came about. And do you have anything

24:45.359 --> 24:48.622
that you have written yourself? I mean, have you 
ever recorded any of your, you know, thoughts? No,

24:53.267 --> 24:58.912
we did an informal Phi Delta Kappa a few years back 
when we organized the chapter. Had a little

24:59.692 --> 25:07.900
research grant for Dr. Barker and Dr. McCandless 
and I in which we looked at, you know, incidents of

25:08.993 --> 25:12.718
male elementary school teachers. Because we felt 
like one of the facts we had was a male figure for

25:12.738 --> 25:27.739
elementary school children to identify with. And 
of course we documented with that little study the

25:27.759 --> 25:36.891
fact that there was a huge preponderance of 
females elementary level, even in the

25:37.107 --> 25:40.493
principal's office. There was a huge group of 
hundreds of females in that office. And I contrast

25:44.761 --> 25:56.702
this

25:44.761 --> 25:56.702
as only a slight change from the times when not only 
were you supposed to be female to teach elementary

25:44.761 --> 25:56.702
school,

26:06.605 --> 26:08.046
If you got married, you had to quit. Especially if 
you got married and got pregnant, you had to quit

26:08.066 --> 26:11.430
teaching. Well, there's a little bit of change 
over the years with respect to that. I also did a

26:16.995 --> 26:34.992
study for Southwest Athletic Conference as part 
of my faculty response military where we studied

26:16.995 --> 26:34.992
prediction of grade point ratios for the whole 
university in order to set standards

26:41.317 --> 26:49.927
And in this respect we studied all males, not just 
male athletes, at the nine Southwest Conference

26:41.317 --> 26:49.927
schools. And it was with this study that we 
demonstrated the usable

26:51.108 --> 27:11.172
qualities as far as SAT and grade point ratio are 
concerned of the various schools. Have you done

27:13.565 --> 27:16.850
any of your memoirs of anything? No. Never? I have 
not. Are you going to now that you have all this

27:18.493 --> 27:20.115
time? That's a good thought. I've had some 
experience. I think you should. You know, one of

27:26.805 --> 27:29.810
the reasons I... I hope I can finish this. I do thank 
you for your time, and I hope if I have some

27:30.511 --> 27:33.295
questions I can come back.
