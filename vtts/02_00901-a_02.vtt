00:05.701 --> 00:17.220
So planning 621 and planning 623 were courses that 
were created to try to address the interest that

00:05.701 --> 00:17.220
was emerging on campus by some students who wanted 
to work in developing countries. And in time, as I

00:17.240 --> 00:28.038
offered them more and more, there seemed to be more 
interest for the planning 623 course because it

00:17.240 --> 00:28.038
was a broader course. It covered not only Latin 
America, but also the other parts of the

00:28.058 --> 00:31.624
developing world and the third world. And I then 
began to teach that one more often, 623. And the

00:37.601 --> 00:45.734
Latin 621 was just specialized in Latin America 
less often, because I was able to attract all

00:37.601 --> 00:45.734
types. And it really made for a more interesting 
class. And that's being taught to this day. So

00:51.183 --> 00:59.316
let's take a look at the structure of the 
university, the college, and the department when

00:51.183 --> 00:59.316
you return from Cali. Well, we had, of course, a 
program chairman, which I interpret to be a

01:00.494 --> 01:11.869
department, since we were a department at the 
time, as I recall, a department of the college.

01:15.013 --> 01:18.238
Yes, the department existed within the college. 
But I'm trying to remember when we became

01:20.040 --> 01:28.932
accredited, but I think we were accredited in 1968 
by the AIP.

01:29.907 --> 01:36.716
So that means that veteran would have been in 
existence for three years is one of the

01:29.907 --> 01:36.716
requirements, have reduced a certain number of 
minimum number of graduates. Right. Was an

01:37.798 --> 01:40.621
autonomous unit within the college, meaning a 
department. Had control of our own budget. We

01:42.544 --> 01:50.995
meant control of its budget and the department 
had, could in fact assign, was assigned a

01:42.544 --> 01:50.995
department operating expense in faculty 
positions. And so that all those criteria were

01:53.098 --> 01:56.623
required by AIP at the time. and had been met in 
there because we were accredited, if I recall, in

01:57.228 --> 02:03.655
1968 was the first year we became accredited. And I 
believe it was the first program in the state of

02:03.675 --> 02:06.758
Texas to receive such a recognition. So we had the 
departmental format and small faculty, to be

02:06.778 --> 02:16.609
sure, a growing department. It was a young, 
growing department struggling to establish

02:16.629 --> 02:26.880
itself and develop a constituency, of course, and 
build up the course offerings.

02:28.109 --> 02:30.553
Well, how was it structured? Who was leading who? 
How did we report to the university structure?

02:36.643 --> 02:40.109
Well, of course, the department head reported to 
the dean. The department head was Joe McGraw.

02:43.515 --> 02:44.817
Joseph McGraw, Joe McGraw. Then he reported, of 
course, to Ed Romanek, who was the dean at the time.

02:50.065 --> 02:54.032
But it was my understanding that our academic 
programs was not lodged in the College of

02:54.704 --> 02:57.267
Architecture. It was in the College of 
Engineering. And our administrative dean was the

02:59.469 --> 03:06.397
architecture dean.

03:06.477 --> 03:11.583
And so that all of our faculty salaries were those 
of the College of Engineering. And then when that

03:13.125 --> 03:22.956
was changed, because when I was hired, I had to 
interview with Dean Benson of engineering, not

03:13.125 --> 03:22.956
Ramanek. I see. OK, yeah. I

03:24.252 --> 03:36.370
don't remember that experience myself, because I 
interviewed with Ed Romnick, yes, and I didn't

03:24.252 --> 03:36.370
interview with Dean Benson. I remember that you 
mentioned that initially when the program was

03:36.610 --> 03:41.097
first recommended, It was supposed to, because 
the College of Architecture, when it was the

03:41.482 --> 03:50.896
School of Architecture, was under the Dean of 
Engineering, was part of the School of

03:41.482 --> 03:50.896
Engineering, or the College of Engineering. But a 
school within the college. A school within the

03:53.019 --> 03:53.820
college. Then they changed it from a school and 
made it a full-fledged college. And of course,

03:57.927 --> 04:00.330
that wasn't existed by the time I came back. Do you 
know when that occurred? Oh, gee, it must have been

04:02.153 --> 04:07.641
65, somewhere in there, if I remember correctly. 
About the time that Joe McGraw got back here? Yeah,

04:10.220 --> 04:13.905
it may have been 64, perhaps, and a little bit 
before he came. And see, Joe and Ed had actually

04:14.706 --> 04:21.935
proposed a planning program way back, long before 
this, you know. I would say back in 1960, something

04:21.955 --> 04:26.441
like that, or 59, 58, somewhere. When Joe was 
originally teaching architecture. Yeah, right.

04:29.785 --> 04:37.054
But he had gone through Harvard and city planning 
and, of course, had the planning background

04:29.785 --> 04:37.054
experience and began to teach planning-related 
subjects within the school. programs, and Ed had

04:37.169 --> 04:43.978
expressed an interest in, yes, setting up a 
funding emphasis and a funding program. So they

04:44.639 --> 05:04.105
had submitted those ideas way back, and I guess 
those were used then to create, once the College

04:44.639 --> 05:04.105
was created of architecture, College of 
Architecture and Environmental Design was

04:44.639 --> 05:04.105
created, then they resubmitted the request for 
establishing a department, and this was a new

04:44.639 --> 05:04.105
college establishing departments, and the idea 
was accepted. And I suppose because they'd been

05:04.557 --> 05:13.811
part of the engineering college, then they felt 
that they needed this coordination with

05:04.557 --> 05:13.811
engineering in making this transition and 
establishing the program jointly. But that

05:15.012 --> 05:33.720
doesn't, then when did we report to the 
interdisciplinary committee that Van Riper from

05:15.012 --> 05:33.720
political science and the other faculty members, 
Virgil Stover from civil engineering, And what's

05:34.274 --> 05:38.118
his name from Parks and Recreation? Like the clear 
gun? Clear gun. Well, as I recall, that was a...

05:41.161 --> 05:45.605
What's his name from geography? Sonnenfeld. 
Okay, well, that was a committee that I guess

05:48.548 --> 06:01.260
existed before I came, and as I understood it, that 
was a committee that the department had us to work

05:48.548 --> 06:01.260
with and coordinate with, although... And report 
to. I suppose, yeah. Periodically.

06:04.565 --> 06:05.106
Periodically. That's part of a coordinated 
effort. But I don't remember any gatherings as

06:07.869 --> 06:13.976
such, you know, that we had with them. I assume that 
the department head was communicating with them.

06:16.900 --> 06:21.865
That's an administrative function more than 
anything else. But we were running the funding

06:21.885 --> 06:23.367
program. We felt that we were the trained people in 
the field, and we knew what the field needed and

06:24.376 --> 06:29.465
what the field required. And we had a 48 hour 
recognized program, 48 credit hour recognized

06:29.685 --> 06:42.527
program, of which about 25% were outside of the 
department. And I can tell you, model program

06:44.491 --> 06:49.698
because most of the curriculums did not require 
that of other students. But we were committed to

06:50.299 --> 06:53.202
the interdisciplinary philosophy of planning. I 
was conversing with the concept that was

06:53.963 --> 07:07.461
developed in Chicago at the University of Chicago 
back in the 50s when our friend from California

07:08.926 --> 07:18.482
Well, one of the initiators of the 
interdisciplinary planning concept, and he used

07:08.926 --> 07:18.482
the University of Chicago as his base to try to test 
it. And I believe it lasted three or four years

07:18.962 --> 07:22.909
there, and then they did away with the program. As a 
matter of fact, I applied there the year that the

07:23.430 --> 07:27.837
program collapsed. He's now the dean at UCLA. Oh, 
okay. Well, who recently died. Yes, yes. Very well

07:34.726 --> 07:37.050
known, of course, in the field throughout the 
world, too. Okay. Not Voorhees. No. G.U.S. Oh,

07:41.658 --> 07:44.342
thank you. Yeah. Okay. So we were committed to the 
interdisciplinary approach to planning, so

07:45.184 --> 07:59.588
students would be aware of the economic and social 
implications of the physical needs of the field,

07:45.184 --> 07:59.588
administrative aspects, dealing with city 
government and how planning could be

07:45.184 --> 07:59.588
implemented, and, of course, the capital 
improvements aspects of it. And this broadness

08:00.108 --> 08:04.573
required, we felt, exposure to other fields as 
well. So they took courses in economics and

08:04.593 --> 08:09.137
sociology, political science. And of course, we 
modeled this curriculum. Each student was a

08:12.081 --> 08:16.645
specially designed curriculum that met the core 
requirements first. And then beyond that, then we

08:17.166 --> 08:28.798
would specialize the curriculum to a particular 
student's interests, maybe more into the

08:17.166 --> 08:28.798
physical design or more into administrative, 
political aspects, government aspects, or

08:17.166 --> 08:28.798
perhaps social aspects. It gave the program an 
interesting, how would you say, it was appealing

08:29.217 --> 08:45.539
to many students because when they read our 
catalogs, they felt they could model a curriculum

08:29.217 --> 08:45.539
to their interest, which is very different from 
other schools where they had to model it after the

08:29.217 --> 08:45.539
faculty's interest and with very little leeway. 
Well, it's a broad enough field that just about

08:46.000 --> 08:49.905
anyone can find their own niche in it. Exactly, 
exactly. And that was the point we were trying to

08:51.207 --> 08:57.435
make, that there was just about nothing that 
planning didn't touch in giving a community life,

08:51.207 --> 08:57.435
you know. And that what we were trying to say was 
that planning should be part of, on the one hand,

08:57.888 --> 09:08.878
the policy-making part, which was to formulate 
with the mayor and the council and the planning

08:57.888 --> 09:08.878
commissioners long-range planning policy for a 
community. But it also could be very technical. If

09:10.679 --> 09:17.145
you wanted to get down to the transportation end of 
it, to the housing end of it, you could get into the

09:10.679 --> 09:17.145
technical areas and be more of a technical type. 
OK. Well, so we had the university operating, I

09:17.525 --> 09:27.574
think, department operating under this umbrella 
interdisciplinary committee. And Joe McGraw was

09:28.229 --> 09:30.612
the department head. Right. Then what was the next 
change in the administration? Well, I guess

09:35.658 --> 09:49.616
because of the unique nature of the program and the 
fact that we were sort of a maverick operation,

09:35.658 --> 09:49.616
really we were a maverick department as the 
department went on this campus, we dealt with

09:35.658 --> 09:49.616
sensitive issues that were politically based 
issues. And as we talked about earlier about the

09:50.677 --> 09:57.426
political turmoil in the country, I guess we were 
sometimes looked at with strange It's a strange

09:57.727 --> 09:59.330
operation.

10:01.955 --> 10:06.863
We tend to sometimes ruffle feathers to put it in a 
party way. Well, I think planning dealt with

10:06.883 --> 10:11.171
government and with political issues. Yes. So 
that was new for the university administration.

10:14.998 --> 10:16.160
Here, yes. Especially at A&M, yeah. Yeah, to 
handle that kind of a thing. Exactly, exactly. And

10:20.997 --> 10:25.502
then the environmental issues became a powerful 
tool and that affected our campus as well. And we

10:25.682 --> 10:31.127
would oftentimes be outspoken about certain 
issues and would bring attention to ourselves.

10:31.227 --> 10:34.871
And our students would maybe raise questions in 
classrooms oftentimes. And we would get feedback

10:34.931 --> 10:42.059
from other faculty that our students would raise, 
in fact, critical issues that other students from

10:34.931 --> 10:42.059
other careers would not raise, you know. And they 
did tend to create turmoil in the positive sense in

10:42.079 --> 10:46.363
terms of intellectual searching. So anyway, 
that, of course, and I guess there were some

10:46.782 --> 10:56.400
problems of administration that surfaced, 
allocation of funds or the use of funds or the

10:46.782 --> 10:56.400
reporting procedures. Somehow that was brought 
up or something to that effect happened. And so all

11:01.410 --> 11:07.221
of a sudden we were in a turmoil in terms of how we 
related to who and what and administration. Our

11:07.572 --> 11:10.374
very existence was questioned at one time. And in 
fact, I saw a memorandum was handed to me one time

11:10.575 --> 11:18.221
showing some wording to the effect that they might 
abolish the department. So I became very

11:18.281 --> 11:26.748
concerned about this because I had made, you know, 
made an effort to come back to A&M to build an

11:18.281 --> 11:26.748
interesting, a good and solid program at A&M. And I 
felt we had a good faculty, a very well-educated

11:27.589 --> 11:32.313
and experienced faculty. And I felt we had a good 
program, a good format. And I felt it was just

11:34.935 --> 11:37.377
misunderstood, and therefore, People were 
maybe, you know, perhaps being a little too

11:37.762 --> 11:45.670
critical about certain things and therefore were 
putting the whole program in jeopardy. So

11:45.690 --> 12:04.150
essentially what happened was that we were put 
under basically the Dean of Engineering and the

11:45.690 --> 12:04.150
reporting and everything else was so strict, you 
know, that Professor McGraw decided he didn't

11:45.690 --> 12:04.150
want to fall under that umbrella or didn't feel 
that it was appropriate for him to be a department

11:45.690 --> 12:04.150
head and not have the autonomy that was required. 
So he decided to resign the position. So we were

12:07.968 --> 12:15.497
left there with no department head for a while, and 
the dean of the college was then asked to oversee

12:07.968 --> 12:15.497
the department in its interim period. That was 
Romany. Yes. He was dean at the time, and so he was

12:17.900 --> 12:22.025
asked to become the overseer of the operation. But 
of course, he was an architect and mostly

12:22.065 --> 12:27.351
concerned with the College of Architecture, not 
only with architecture, but the other

12:22.065 --> 12:27.351
departments. What year was that? Gee, I'm trying 
to remember. It was probably about 1970. One or

12:33.888 --> 12:34.690
two? Sixty-nine, maybe? No, no, no. Oh, I'm sorry, 
70. Yeah, 70, 70, 71. I think maybe in the fall of 70

12:39.921 --> 12:43.329
or spring of 70, you know. Because I had just come, I 
think I had just come back from Colombia, you know,

12:43.349 --> 12:47.498
that would have been early 70. Somewhere in there. 
Yeah. And so, of course, the faculty wanted to keep

12:50.527 --> 12:53.812
the program going. And we felt strongly about it. 
And we had students. And we were a growing

12:56.335 --> 12:57.897
department. So we, of course, accepted this sort 
of overview committee under the dean of

12:58.518 --> 13:05.047
engineering. And so then Dean Romanek asked me if, 
well, began to ask me if I could look into the

13:05.768 --> 13:16.824
secretaries, see if they needed any help or had any 
questions and so forth. So it was sort of a de facto I

13:16.844 --> 13:20.449
became like a department head. by overseeing 
their work and answering this or filling out forms

13:21.070 --> 13:26.278
and all that. So then after a semester of that, Dean 
Romanek then recommended me to the

13:26.719 --> 13:38.517
administration as interim head of the department 
until, you know, some decision could be made. So

13:38.537 --> 13:39.738
they accepted that. So I was interim department 
head and worked in that position, I believe, for

13:40.580 --> 13:45.387
about a year, maybe less. And then he elevated the 
recommendation to full, you know, department

13:50.112 --> 13:59.206
head and they accepted it and I served as the 
department head position until I left to go to

13:50.112 --> 13:59.206
Nicaragua. I was asked by AID if I would go to 
Nicaragua to work on the reconstruction of

13:59.947 --> 14:11.125
Managua and I would be principal international 
advisor to the vice minister of urban planning and

13:59.947 --> 14:11.125
I felt that by then the department had stabilized 
and that we were And we were back in charge again. In

14:13.124 --> 14:20.295
other words, the dean of engineering had seen that 
we were, in fact, we were following our own

14:13.124 --> 14:20.295
policies of 25% coursework outside of the 
department. And the students were, you know,

14:20.695 --> 14:24.461
those standards were being met and everything 
else. And, in fact, we were under scrutiny by this

14:25.162 --> 14:28.286
committee for a year, a whole year. We met over at 
the graduate college under dean, who was dean of

14:28.787 --> 14:34.015
the graduate college at the time.

14:37.880 --> 14:39.222
Yeah, we'll remember anyway here in a moment. And 
he brought the committee together. It was an

14:42.885 --> 14:45.148
internship committee from around the campus. 
Everybody except, there was nobody from the

14:45.828 --> 14:47.911
college. They were all outside of the college. And 
we would, I met all their answers and

14:49.933 --> 14:55.539
requirements, and we reviewed curriculums. We 
reviewed department programs, and we looked at

14:56.099 --> 15:02.046
student degree programs at random. And they 
asked, could we look in and see if there's an effect

15:02.286 --> 15:05.269
happening? Because you say here that they 
require, that you require 25% outside the

15:05.289 --> 15:09.073
department. And so I said, yes, go ahead. I mean, I 
had to give the clearance. They wouldn't have

15:11.705 --> 15:13.727
looked at the files without my approval. But I went 
ahead and said, yes, go ahead. So they pulled out at

15:15.489 --> 15:18.972
random files from the graduate college records. 
And they, in fact, were able to confirm that not

15:19.712 --> 15:25.698
only did we meet the 25%, all the time we exceeded 
it. So that we were, in other words, being

15:26.338 --> 15:30.122
consistent in our policies and in their 
implementation. And the other important thing

15:30.802 --> 15:39.330
was that we were meeting the recognition criteria 
of the AIP at the time.

15:40.019 --> 15:41.400
Excuse me a minute. To the transcriber, you can go 
back and fill in the name of the graduate college

15:41.941 --> 15:48.107
dean. Was Dean George W. Kunze? Yes, exactly. 
K-U-N-Z-E. K-U-N-Z-E, very much so. And so Dean

15:54.573 --> 15:56.995
Kunze was very fair in the whole procedure. He 
oversaw the whole procedure. And the committee

16:00.458 --> 16:05.503
members, they were from political science, Ben 
Riper, Paul Ben Riper. I believe it was Joe

16:06.684 --> 16:09.807
Sonnenfeld from geography and so forth. I mean, 
they were all very qualified people and very

16:10.090 --> 16:14.036
respected faculty on the campus. And sympathetic 
to the idea. Yeah. Oh, yes. Very much so. And they

16:16.961 --> 16:19.005
were very interested in the program. They wanted 
the program to succeed. And they were convinced

16:20.327 --> 16:23.512
and they were satisfied that the program was being 
run properly. And so then, at that point, they

16:24.273 --> 16:27.659
released us from this overseer. We were then 
became a full-fledged department, autonomous

16:28.360 --> 16:35.271
department at that point. And the other important 
thing was that we had to meet the AIP requirements,

16:35.572 --> 16:40.017
and they could only be met by us, you see. That was 
the important thing. That's why I'm also in favor

16:41.519 --> 16:52.332
of standards for recognition, and because... 
Well, Chewy, when you left for Nicaragua, who then

16:41.519 --> 16:52.332
became department head? Okay, the request came in 
the fall, I believe it was fall of 74, and I asked

16:52.352 --> 17:04.887
Dean Reed at the time if he thought it would be okay. 
for me to accept this appointment. And he said,

17:07.731 --> 17:09.033
well, yes, let us begin. So Romanek had been 
replaced by Ray Reed? Oh, yes, yes, that's right.

17:12.458 --> 17:17.706
Ray Reed had come on board, I guess, two or three 
years before that. From the University of Iowa.

17:18.908 --> 17:19.869
Yes, exactly. He became the dean of the college, 
exactly. I forget about that. So, you know, I

17:24.475 --> 17:26.959
checked with him, and he said, yes, if It's an 
important program. It would be a credit to the

17:29.347 --> 17:32.189
college and to the department, to the university. 
We definitely would be interested in you doing it.

17:34.371 --> 17:41.118
And so all I'm interested in is that you can find a 
way to transition and then have someone else come

17:34.371 --> 17:41.118
on board. It would be in the spring of 75. Who did 
that? And as I recall, Professor Stover, I

17:45.662 --> 17:54.550
believe, Dr. Virgil Stover from civil 
engineering, who had a joint appointment with

17:45.662 --> 17:54.550
planning. was asked then to serve as interim 
department head. He served for one semester. I

17:59.898 --> 18:05.545
believe so, because then, well, let's see, was 
there somebody else then? He served for one

18:07.207 --> 18:13.054
semester and one summer, I believe it was. And I 
might add personally that Stober's

18:13.234 --> 18:22.545
administration was quite a surprise to everybody 
because he turned He was extremely liberal in his

18:22.947 --> 18:36.803
administration, and he was very

18:22.947 --> 18:36.803
concerned with any individual's problems and 
trying to solve them. And although mistakes were

18:37.344 --> 18:44.372
made, they were honest mistakes, and he moved very 
quickly to correct them. So that as an interim

18:44.392 --> 18:48.837
department head, in my judgment, he was 
excellent. That's good. I didn't experience that

18:50.075 --> 18:51.557
because I was abroad. Either way. But I had a, I'm 
telling you, for me it was a grim experience as a

18:52.538 --> 18:59.869
department head because my job was to protect the 
department from extinction. And I felt that I had

19:00.290 --> 19:06.339
done that job and I had no, ever had any aspirations 
to be a department head in the first place. But I

19:07.420 --> 19:11.607
felt that we needed to protect the department and 
that happened. And so when this opportunity

19:11.627 --> 19:15.212
developed in Manawa, which is an interesting 
assignment, I said, I would like to try it, you

19:15.698 --> 19:18.341
know. Well, why was the department so near to being 
abolished by the administration? Well, again, I

19:24.288 --> 19:36.102
think it was this misunderstanding about what we 
were about, and they just weren't quite ready at

19:24.288 --> 19:36.102
the time to accept the fact that departments could 
get involved with politically-based issues and

19:24.288 --> 19:36.102
really get out there and do things. You know, we 
were involved in the Model Cities program. That

19:37.924 --> 19:41.588
was something that Joe McGraw got us into way back, 
and I think it occurred a little bit before I came to

19:41.922 --> 20:07.542
the department, when we first got involved with 
it, and we would send out interns out to the

19:41.922 --> 20:07.542
communities, and they would deal with very, 
really serious social and economic problems,

19:41.922 --> 20:07.542
with deteriorated neighborhoods that were, you 
know, up in arms, because how come we don't have

19:41.922 --> 20:07.542
water and sewer, and, you know, no funds to repair 
our homes, so the model cities program was a very

19:41.922 --> 20:07.542
important internship, part of our internship 
program, and we made that Eventually that became a

20:07.758 --> 20:10.061
model, and we used that. I can see that that would be 
upsetting to the administration that was not used

20:10.582 --> 20:15.950
to having such activist roles. Exactly. And 
sometimes I think they also received, on

20:16.571 --> 20:32.414
occasion, phone calls, you see, because our 
students were making some pretty aggressive

20:16.571 --> 20:32.414
recommendations to some of these communities, 
and we ourselves as faculty oftentimes would make

20:16.571 --> 20:32.414
an impression or make a suggestion that might not 
set well. And though there were also some

20:32.795 --> 20:36.280
irregularities in... the funding and 
administration of resources? Yeah, there was

20:41.240 --> 20:46.426
some accounting procedures that were not 
followed. And of course, that is not necessarily,

20:46.486 --> 20:56.839
I don't think there were any legalities in terms 
of, you know, but more in terms of procedures that

20:46.486 --> 20:56.839
have to be followed or required by the state. And I 
think that eventually the administration felt

21:00.121 --> 21:07.549
that they couldn't handle that anymore because it 
would reflect eventually badly on upper-level

21:00.121 --> 21:07.549
administrators who had to oversee this. As I 
recall, there was a substantial amount of ill will

21:07.669 --> 21:11.694
generated at that time. Yes. Oh yeah, I had to 
overcome all of that. It was really painful, I'm

21:13.316 --> 21:14.858
telling you. So that, yeah, that was sort of in your 
lap. Oh yes, I had to take all that and run with it,

21:17.601 --> 21:23.327
you know, and I had to actually work towards 
de-siphoning all that, or how do you say it, or

21:23.712 --> 21:31.586
defusing, rather, that negative animosity that 
had been built up. A lot of it, I think, just totally

21:32.308 --> 21:36.195
unwarranted, but it was just the politics of the 
time. A lot of conservatives that were on the

21:36.215 --> 21:43.168
faculty since then have changed, you know, but to 
some extent, much more so. And you're talking

21:43.649 --> 21:47.155
about the upper administration, not the faculty. 
No, not the faculty. Although, of course, some

21:48.301 --> 22:00.458
faculty in other departments would also be 
overreacting to what some of the things we were

21:48.301 --> 22:00.458
doing, where they inevitably, I'm sure, go up and 
talk against us, perhaps at meetings elsewhere if

21:48.301 --> 22:00.458
they had the opportunity. Typical campus 
politics. Yeah, very much so. See, we were trying

22:03.922 --> 22:15.317
to get into the real world, and we were trying to put 
ourselves not only exposed to theory, but to the

22:03.922 --> 22:15.317
application of theory, because that's where it 
really means something, to get out there and

22:03.922 --> 22:15.317
really try something and to test ideas. In spite of 
our location in College Station. That was one of

22:17.392 --> 22:24.546
the great things about the Model Cities program 
and putting our internships out there. Yeah, that

22:24.807 --> 22:29.015
was a good program that was brought to the 
department by Joe and his efforts. John Shanahan,

22:30.498 --> 22:33.524
in fact, was also very instrumental in that 
program. He helped Joe in getting that program

22:33.544 --> 22:37.071
established. initially worked on it, and I then 
got involved with it myself in helping place

22:37.456 --> 22:42.003
students. And later on, of course, I had to 
supervise the placement of students as part of the

22:42.063 --> 22:47.851
department responsibilities. But 
interestingly enough, we always had good

22:47.871 --> 22:52.178
feedback from the students' work. Okay, so as the 
department became stabilized, we had shown the

22:52.759 --> 23:05.337
administration we were a responsible faculty, we 
had the qualifications, and we could run a good

22:52.759 --> 23:05.337
program, a recognized program. I felt good. I 
mean, so we had stabilized the program and were

23:07.415 --> 23:11.599
being finally given back the reins to the 
department. And at the time, this was in the fall of

23:12.139 --> 23:24.932
74, I got a request from a USAID if I wanted to go to 
Central America, to Manawa, Nicaragua, to help

23:12.139 --> 23:24.932
with the reconstruction of Manawa, which had been 
damaged by an earthquake. And I had the

23:25.973 --> 23:29.537
opportunity to work in South America. I wanted to 
do more of that. I thought it was good for us as a

23:30.638 --> 23:33.501
department and a university to be involved. 
Central America and the Latin American region.

23:37.376 --> 23:38.920
And it was a unique experience, actually. It was a 
unique project to work in the reconstruction of a

23:38.940 --> 23:42.028
major capital city. So I was, AID said, if you want 
to go during the Thanksgiving holidays and look

23:47.200 --> 23:53.428
around, talk to the people over there, visit with 
them, they can interview with you and you can see if

23:47.200 --> 23:53.428
you like the situation. You might make a decision 
over the holidays and before Christmas and then

23:54.310 --> 24:01.940
we'll know if we can depend on you and you can get 
your clearance from the university. This was

24:01.960 --> 24:03.762
1974. In 74, right. This would be in October of 74, 
November, I'm sorry, Thanksgiving holidays of

24:04.263 --> 24:09.169
74. So I did that and I went and visited and came back 
and I was impressed by the work that was being done

24:10.171 --> 24:16.820
and the scale and the magnitude of the project. It 
was a UN team working there, and then the AAD team.

24:20.019 --> 24:29.391
It was about a total of about 50 or 60 professionals 
that I would be overseeing, helping the Vice

24:20.019 --> 24:29.391
Minister of Riverland oversee the 
reconstruction program, which was vetted at over

24:20.019 --> 24:29.391
$70 million. So I came back and I talked to Ray Reed, 
of course, the dean at the time, and I asked Ray if he

24:29.411 --> 24:39.924
thought it would be okay for me to accept this 
assignment. I was interested in the assignment if

24:39.944 --> 24:42.807
there was no problem with him. And he said, no, it's 
no problem, as long as I can have some time to

24:43.293 --> 24:58.651
transition, meaning that I would have to stay 
probably at least a month into the next semester to

24:43.293 --> 24:58.651
help somebody take over the department, or help 
him actually manage the department meanwhile

24:43.293 --> 24:58.651
until he could find someone. And so we agreed to 
that, and so I went ahead and made my commitments to

24:59.552 --> 25:04.598
AAD and got everything arranged. And I was able to 
leave in early 75 to go to Manawa and work on the

25:05.259 --> 25:10.085
project. And I understand that later, Dr. Virgil 
Stover was then asked to serve as interim

25:12.115 --> 25:20.966
department head at the time to run the program in 
the fall of, sorry, in the spring of 1975. And then,

25:21.306 --> 25:24.730
of course, I was gone for a year. The contract was 
for one year. And during that time, I guess, as you

25:26.512 --> 25:33.480
remember earlier, Virgil served, I guess, 
through the summer of 75. And Dean Reed had asked me

25:33.841 --> 25:39.928
if he wanted me to hold the position open for me. But 
I could be, I could come back to department head.

25:43.466 --> 25:44.927
And I felt that it was not appropriate. I thought it 
would be best to have a permanent person assigned

25:44.947 --> 25:48.951
to the department head position. I didn't think it 
was good to have interim department heads. It

25:53.675 --> 25:57.358
would just not help us with our marketing the 
program. And so then a search was begun. I believe

26:00.061 --> 26:04.285
Dr. Rosler was then hired by the University 
Service Permanent Department Head. While I was in

26:04.825 --> 26:08.008
Managua, this all has occurred. I managed then 
later on to, of course, be in touch with Dr. Roesler

26:08.596 --> 26:14.725
through communications through telephone and 
mail. And what actually happened, I was asked to

26:15.446 --> 26:19.051
stay another year in Manawa. And I got an 
extension. The university approved the

26:21.615 --> 26:22.856
extension. And so I stayed there for two years. In 
fact, we stayed in Manawa for two years. Very

26:28.725 --> 26:36.055
interesting assignment working, helping 
rebuild the major capital city that was damaged

26:28.725 --> 26:36.055
very heavily by an earthquake in 73. the immediate 
emergency reconstruction had taken place,

26:36.575 --> 26:47.189
basically clearing the roads and cordoning off a 
lot of the downtown area because 90% of the

26:36.575 --> 26:47.189
downtown had been damaged and destroyed. And so 
our job was to come up with new plans and what was

26:48.150 --> 27:05.873
called an immediate action reconstruction 
program, which is to rebuild the city, and it would

26:48.150 --> 27:05.873
cost over $70 million to do that, to just get it to a 
certain level of operation and rebuild the

26:48.150 --> 27:05.873
infrastructure, the streets, new land uses, and 
so forth. And, but because of the danger of the,

27:06.072 --> 27:14.921
there were four major faults that went to downtown 
and the lack of understanding of what those faults

27:06.072 --> 27:14.921
might do in the future. They had hired a firm from 
California to do some engineering work and

27:15.582 --> 27:20.447
geology work. And they did that and they 
identified the faults and, and so then we were able

27:20.947 --> 27:27.574
to then make some recommendations based on the new 
information. So it was an interesting new land use

27:27.594 --> 27:30.797
planning being based on faults and the types of 
soils and what could be, what could not be put on

27:31.418 --> 27:35.844
those areas.

27:39.850 --> 27:46.459
Okay, so then we, the teams were working together, 
the AID team and the UN-led team. The UN-led team

27:47.321 --> 27:55.632
was basically working on long-range planning, 
and the AID team was working on in the direction of

27:47.321 --> 27:55.632
construction programming and planning. And so 
the work had was complex enough and it required so

27:59.127 --> 28:03.453
much effort to put together that I would have to 
stay another year. So I stayed another year to

28:03.473 --> 28:08.841
finish the programming of this project. And I was 
able to come back right before things got very

28:08.861 --> 28:16.973
messy in Nicaragua when the Sandinista movement 
became to surface. And I felt that it was time for us

28:18.295 --> 28:22.121
to get back anyway. I wanted to get back to the 
campus and continue my association with the

28:22.201 --> 28:26.367
department program. And so we got back in the 
early... Of course, you were there with your

28:26.870 --> 28:29.994
family. Yes, right. My family was there with me. My 
kids grew up eating mangoes and learning Spanish

28:33.419 --> 28:38.847
in Nicaragua, the older ones, of course. And so, 
yeah, we came back in early 77. We got back to the

28:42.392 --> 28:45.537
campus. And, of course, by then, we had a new 
department head. Dr. Rose had been department

28:48.341 --> 28:52.607
head, I guess, by then for about a year and a 
quarter, perhaps, you know. and had been

28:53.127 --> 28:58.192
instrumental in giving new direction to the 
department with his background and experience.

28:59.413 --> 29:06.620
And I guess had gotten a couple of faculty 
positions approved. And I believe Dr. Pugh was at

29:07.481 --> 29:12.326
the time had already by then had joined the 
faculty. And we had had another young fellow, I

29:13.027 --> 29:19.253
can't recall his name, was also in the faculty in 
mathematical type. I was supposed to be working

29:19.705 --> 29:24.032
with statistics and quantification techniques. 
And then a young lady. Who went to Brooklyn

29:26.997 --> 29:29.401
College? Sharon, I think. Sharon. Sharon, I 
believe, was her. In health planning. Yeah,

29:35.671 --> 29:37.474
health planning was her area of interest. And she 
worked with Don Sweeney. And Don Sweeney, at the

29:39.918 --> 29:44.125
time, also, I guess, had joined our faculty. I 
don't remember if it was on the faculty or not. I

29:46.807 --> 29:50.692
think he was working on the health emphasis by 
then. Although he was associate dean, I believe,

29:50.712 --> 29:52.395
too. And I believe had functioned at one time 
anyway as associate dean and was now also on our

29:53.676 --> 30:08.196
faculty working on the health program, health 
emphasis program, which was a growing and

29:53.676 --> 30:08.196
emerging area of interest. And so I came back, of 
course. Dr. Rosa wanted me to help with the area of

30:12.423 --> 30:17.769
physical planning and emphasis towards Latin 
American region. He felt that my background in the

30:18.389 --> 30:30.282
region would be a strength and also to help with 
students that we had, a lot of students from the

30:18.389 --> 30:30.282
Central American and South American area and some 
from Mexico that were interested in our program

30:18.389 --> 30:30.282
and help counsel those students. So I was sort of 
assigned that kind of an area of emphasis and

30:31.223 --> 30:38.430
concentrated on physical planning and an 
emphasis towards the Latin American region. We

30:41.483 --> 30:58.164
had a program, if you recall, we worked with, when I 
had been working in Costa Rica earlier, this is

30:41.483 --> 30:58.164
what our department had, we developed a program to 
work with public officials in Costa Rica to help

30:41.483 --> 30:58.164
establish planning in Costa Rica, local planning 
in Costa Rica. And we worked with a gentleman named

30:58.184 --> 31:03.010
Armando Rouse. His first name is A-R-M-A-N-D-O. 
Second name, last name is A-R-A-U-Z. And he was the

31:08.903 --> 31:14.949
director of an interesting institute, which was 
developed to support community development. And

31:14.969 --> 31:20.254
so with him, who had some planning experience, we 
developed the first planning efforts in Costa

31:14.969 --> 31:20.254
Rica. And his institute then transferred all that 
to the National Planning Office. When did all this

31:23.097 --> 31:24.499
happen? Well, that was 70, let's see, it was 73, 
somewhere in there, 74. You didn't mention Costa

31:30.905 --> 31:32.487
Rica before. No, I had forgotten about that. In 
fact, Clark Davis and I worked on that, and it was an

31:34.609 --> 31:38.893
oversight on my part. When I was department head, 
Claude and I developed this program. I had met

31:44.317 --> 31:48.341
some... That was before you went to South America 
at all, wasn't it? Well, no, it was after

31:48.361 --> 31:51.244
because... After which? After Colombia, 
because... After Colombia. One of the AID

31:53.807 --> 32:03.116
officers that I got to know when I was working in 
Colombia was transferred to Costa Rica and was

31:53.807 --> 32:03.116
interested in my helping him with some projects he 
was doing, he was working on. And when we had worked

32:03.957 --> 32:06.940
in Cali, in Colombia, He knew my work and was 
interested in what I had done. So he asked me if I

32:10.467 --> 32:14.373
would go and do some consulting. So I went. And I 
spent some time. And so then he introduced me to

32:16.957 --> 32:21.723
this gentleman from this other institution, 
Community Development Institute. And then he

32:22.004 --> 32:26.570
asked me, well, I explained that we had a program 
here at A&M. We had been working with people from

32:26.691 --> 32:30.656
South Texas, people in local government. I had 
developed a program that was funded under the

32:31.417 --> 32:34.682
National Endowment for the Arts. for public 
officials, and Claude and I had worked on that. And

32:39.005 --> 32:51.384
we put it together, and we would bring public 
officials to A&M for six weeks out of the year, one

32:39.005 --> 32:51.384
week at a time, and we exposed them to a series of 
lectures on planning and design and architecture

32:39.005 --> 32:51.384
and writing, oral presentations and so forth. The 
techniques that a manager in a small office in a

32:51.424 --> 33:02.121
small community with not too much background in 
any professional area, especially planning,

32:51.424 --> 33:02.121
might be better prepared to deal with consultants 
whenever they were asking for work. And so the NEA

33:02.489 --> 33:04.891
thought it was an interesting project, and they 
funded it. So we did that project. I remember I gave

33:07.274 --> 33:11.057
one lecture on California planning. Right. All 
the faculty somehow were involved in giving

33:11.738 --> 33:16.662
lectures or presentations or showing this or 
showing that. And if you recall, we did the same to

33:17.403 --> 33:19.826
the chapter. We had some presentations in Corpus 
Christi and other cities, and we did similar

33:19.846 --> 33:24.350
programs for public officials. So I explained 
this program to the people in Costa Rica, and they

33:25.151 --> 33:28.514
liked it. They said, why don't you do it for us? You 
should do it for us, they said. I said, well, I guess

33:31.261 --> 33:34.284
we could, you know, if there's enough funding to 
support it. So then they said they were interested

33:34.304 --> 33:36.627
in doing that. And so then I came back, and a few 
months later, a few weeks later, they sent this

33:37.328 --> 33:42.653
check for $10,000 for us to do. And they sent the 
check in my name, mind you, you know. And so I said,

33:46.938 --> 33:48.740
what am I going to do with this? I told them it had to 
be to the university. So I ran to the fiscal office

33:51.062 --> 33:56.268
and had it cashed and deposited immediately to the 
departmental accounts, you know. And then we went

33:56.849 --> 33:59.952
to see the university administration about it. 
these clearances that we needed to do this because

34:00.725 --> 34:05.493
they really did it with no warning. We thought we 
were going to go into some negotiation period, but

34:06.274 --> 34:10.020
they just sent the money and said, do it. So we were 
thrust into this thing. So we did it, and that was

34:12.604 --> 34:14.928
for three years, by the way. It was extended twice 
after that. And the last year, I think the last two

34:17.312 --> 34:24.543
visits were handled by Claude and then Dr. 
Roosevelt while I was gone because we started the

34:17.312 --> 34:24.543
program. It must have been in 73, 74, somewhere in 
there. And then they were, in 75 and 76, I was

34:27.472 --> 34:32.040
already in Manawa, you know. Because I know I, 
there was one time I came over, I came back here

34:32.060 --> 34:39.954
while they were having one of the visits. And I 
managed to touch, the first one I did handle, of

34:39.974 --> 34:43.500
course, with Claude, the two of us. And then I think 
there was one occasion when I came and visited with

34:44.201 --> 34:51.133
him because the trip happened to coincide with my 
coming back from Manawa in one trip, you know. I

34:51.400 --> 34:55.324
think what you're going to have to do is get a 
timeline on what you were doing when. I know. It's

34:57.186 --> 34:57.786
crazy. Well, you know, I joined, I was actually, 
part of the reason why I was coming back to the State

34:58.187 --> 35:07.776
of Los Alamos, I had become elected to the board of 
directors of ASPO. I

35:08.837 --> 35:17.486
was interested in joining the ASPO board. Israel 
Stolman I had met him at some conference. I think it

35:20.892 --> 35:23.976
was in Atlanta, Georgia, somewhere. And I had 
become a young fellow from California who was

35:24.777 --> 35:41.319
interested in promoting the Spanish surname 
planner in the field because they noticed there

35:24.777 --> 35:41.319
were very few Spanish-speaking planners in ASP or 
AIT. And so he had approached Israel about, you

35:42.340 --> 35:45.825
know, It was an effort that could be made, and he 
wanted to establish, actually, a national

35:46.193 --> 35:51.318
association of Spanish surname planners. Who is 
that? Gee, it's been so long. A very nice guy from

35:55.762 --> 36:02.749
the Los Angeles area who had some experience in the 
Los Angeles planning office and models his

35:55.762 --> 36:02.749
program. I can recall it. Eventually, we can put it 
in there. And he somehow got a hold of Israel, or

36:08.715 --> 36:15.441
Israel got a hold of me because he knew my name, 
being a member of the ASPO. and IEP and although at

36:16.012 --> 36:45.613
the time Israel was executive director with ASPO 
and invited me to meet with this fellow and he

36:16.012 --> 36:45.613
invited us to a board meeting and we tried to 
discuss and help him with that and introduce him to

36:16.012 --> 36:45.613
the people there and so then after that Israel 
asked me if I would be interested in participating

36:16.012 --> 36:45.613
in the board of directors with ASPO and if I were he 
would recommend me to the board for consideration

36:16.012 --> 36:45.613
so he did And the board accepted the 
recommendation, and I then was asked to serve one

36:46.201 --> 36:56.634
year, I believe, to fill a position for a director 
that had resigned or something had happened, you

36:46.201 --> 36:56.634
know. They needed a person to fill that one year 
remaining. And so that's how I got started in

37:00.318 --> 37:04.804
NASPO, as a board of directors, and then... You 
were actually appointed first. Yes, I was

37:04.824 --> 37:11.572
appointed the first one year to fill a term that was 
left unfilled by... And when you ran, I was an

37:04.824 --> 37:11.572
incumbent, so... Exactly. Then I was... I had to 
run then as an incumbent, right? And... And so then

37:16.238 --> 37:21.506
I had to write the position statement like 
everybody else did and had to run for the election

37:16.238 --> 37:21.506
and so forth. And I was elected, you know, with a 
pretty good margin. And so I served three or four

37:24.551 --> 37:29.299
years, I forget now, as ASPO. And then at that time 
was when the merger question was brought up. And I

37:35.288 --> 37:44.102
also had the opportunity to serve on that board to 
help with the transition towards merging with

37:35.288 --> 37:44.102
AIP. and create what is now known as the American 
Playing Association. You saved ARP from

37:47.511 --> 37:50.495
financial disaster. I'm telling you, that was a 
real headache for us because we had a very solvent

37:50.515 --> 37:54.400
operation. ASPO was a very... ASPO was terribly 
solvent. Very solvent operation. Good level of

37:58.906 --> 38:01.470
services for the money and everything else. And 
everybody in ASPO was very concerned about

38:01.590 --> 38:10.482
joining up with an agency and an institution that 
was in very dire economic straits because of the

38:01.590 --> 38:10.482
mismanagement of their money. So we... By John 
Joyner. I guess. Yes, that's right. He was

38:14.231 --> 38:16.434
executive director at the time. Of AIP. AIP. And so 
as directors, we... Remember the last national

38:18.996 --> 38:28.046
conference when he was executive director was at 
San Antonio, and the national never did pay the

38:18.996 --> 38:28.046
chapter back. Oh, really? For some of the debts 
that were outstanding. I know it was a sizable

38:30.789 --> 38:32.171
debt. Yes. And so as directors, we felt, I fought 
along with other directors for clarifying the

38:32.551 --> 38:38.558
fact to our membership the implications of our 
merging, and that we wanted that debt to be cleared

38:39.213 --> 38:45.622
because we wanted to join as equal partners. In 
other words, that we would not be zapping our funds

38:46.183 --> 38:50.570
to cover, you know. And so I think AIP went through 
some special, I don't know if they did any special

38:51.491 --> 39:01.686
use collections or what, but they managed to get 
themselves out of, they managed to clear the debt

38:51.491 --> 39:01.686
by the time. There was a lot of behind-the-scenes 
activity doing that, and John Shanahan was one of

39:02.547 --> 39:07.895
the people who helped out. Mm-hmm. And there were 
others that helped out as well. Yeah, it was an

39:12.596 --> 39:17.404
interesting experience because there was a lot of 
philosophical views. The ESPO view was basically

39:18.827 --> 39:25.178
geared to the public official, an open 
organization that anybody could belong to. It

39:25.198 --> 39:30.668
wasn't all hung up with the registration and 
recognition and whatever accreditation...

39:30.766 --> 39:35.934
Well, I remember when I joined AIP, there was a 
category called provisional membership. Right.

39:36.795 --> 39:43.045
And I stayed provisional member as long as I could 
because the dues were almost inconsequential.

39:43.065 --> 39:43.185
Right. And you still get all you wanted. Nowadays, 
the students insist on becoming a full member as

39:44.768 --> 39:54.463
soon as they can rather than staying an associate 
member or a student member and having to pay almost

39:44.768 --> 39:54.463
nothing. That's right. And so I was... I was trying 
to maintain an openness in the new association so

39:59.082 --> 40:07.155
that we could still have a broad-based 
organization. Not only have good professional

40:07.816 --> 40:15.588
standards, but also would allow others, because I 
feel that the more we can open it up to other fields

40:07.816 --> 40:15.588
and other people, the stronger the profession 
will be. So that has... That's, of course,

40:15.788 --> 40:18.873
debatable. What? What you just said. The more we 
opened it up to all the other professions and so

40:23.700 --> 40:27.486
forth, because there are Are people in planning 
who feel that the sociologists have not done

40:27.837 --> 40:33.105
planning a particularly good favor? Well, yeah, 
but we have learned from sociology in terms of

40:33.946 --> 40:39.374
research and... That's granted. Yeah. We've 
learned an awful lot from sociology. It could well

40:41.918 --> 40:45.584
be that there's some animosity there between the 
fields, you know, but... Well, there is. There's a

40:46.846 --> 40:53.035
lack of understanding of the comprehensive 
planning process on the part of sociologists. But

40:53.403 --> 40:57.131
that in part is our fault because we have never 
brought them into the process. Well, they've

40:57.852 --> 41:04.085
asserted themselves in their own ways, 
intellectually. I'm talking about people like

41:04.266 --> 41:08.996
Mel Weber, but that's beside the point here. But I 
just There's room for debate on it. Let's put it

41:14.736 --> 41:24.391
this way, opening it up to also citizen planners, 
people who might serve on commissions, who

41:14.736 --> 41:24.391
wouldn't even train professionally, but would 
have an interest in planning and should have an

41:14.736 --> 41:24.391
interest in planning. And that kind of openness, 
and also a good level of service to the membership

41:25.253 --> 41:30.561
at a minimum cost. And broadening the educational 
role. Exactly. And those kind of things were a

41:33.646 --> 41:38.654
concern for us in ASCO, and we feel we managed to 
make that transition. It's been painful. It's

41:39.961 --> 41:43.986
been very hard, a lot of long debate and argument. 
Then I... Well, ESPO was always strong on

41:45.028 --> 41:51.316
education, outlining commissioners and so 
forth. Yes, very much so, and there was a good track

41:51.336 --> 41:54.280
record in that, in fact. Excellent. So there was 
that. And the public advisory service. So then the

41:59.927 --> 42:09.900
question became, I guess we were kind of like the 
Continental Congress, how do you set up the

41:59.927 --> 42:09.900
administration of the new organization, the new 
APA, American Bling Association? so you can

42:10.370 --> 42:13.836
guarantee openness and yet have these 
professional standards. And so there was the idea

42:13.856 --> 42:37.474
of creating an institute, the American Institute 
of Certified Planners, as an institute that could

42:13.856 --> 42:37.474
be housed within the new umbrella organization 
called APA, and that their job would be to oversee

42:13.856 --> 42:37.474
the professional standards of the profession, 
education, and so forth, working with ACSP, and

42:13.856 --> 42:37.474
guarantee that the quality would be there and the 
registration or the accreditation procedures

42:37.977 --> 42:47.392
for the schools and the certification for the 
membership of those who want to be recognized

42:37.977 --> 42:47.392
professional planners. So that was the format 
that was finally agreed upon that would give us

42:48.494 --> 42:57.608
this broadness and yet have this guarantee of 
professional standards. And I guess the last

42:59.311 --> 43:04.980
board meeting in New York in this year, 1980, 2006 
was the last transition from the old board to the

43:05.348 --> 43:11.234
new, finally, APA board. And I happened to have the 
opportunity to be on that board because I was

43:11.994 --> 43:18.481
elected to the APA board. I served for four years as 
the board of directors. And we're still

43:24.086 --> 43:31.373
experiencing a lot of turmoil from the 
transition, interestingly enough, as late as

43:24.086 --> 43:31.373
1985 and 1984. But now the board is much more, I 
believe, settled down, and there's more common

43:32.095 --> 43:41.964
ground, less animosity than there was at one time. 
Well, there apparently has been a lot of

43:42.444 --> 43:55.396
discussion and debate which has centered around 
Texas personalities, such as Bruce McClendon. He

43:56.917 --> 43:59.740
was followed by Dan Lauber from Wisconsin. No, 
Evanston, Illinois, Chicago area. Same thing.

44:03.286 --> 44:04.067
Yeah. And then he's now going to be followed by 
Duncan. Well, no, Norman Krumholz. Krumholz,

44:10.633 --> 44:12.515
that's right. Krumholz from Cleveland. Yes, he 
is. And now he has been followed by Jim Duncan. From

44:20.382 --> 44:21.383
Austin. Right. Well, he was formerly in Florida, 
but then now has been recently transferred to

44:21.703 --> 44:25.907
Austin. So we have two Texas planters who have 
recently been APA presidents, and I personally

44:29.774 --> 44:39.827
feel that we might be endangering ourselves with a 
little bit of overkill. Well, I think some of the

44:39.847 --> 44:47.696
other members of the board felt that there was too 
much of a Texas presence, because we also have on

44:39.847 --> 44:47.696
the board... Ray Lou Henry. Yes, just before, a few 
years before that, and then we had, we still have,

44:47.977 --> 44:59.511
in fact, from Austin, working with Jim Duncan, you 
know him. Oh. Norman Standifer? No, no, no, no. No.

45:05.438 --> 45:08.321
Well, you know, he doesn't work necessarily with 
Jim Duncan. I think he was an officer at one time.

45:11.806 --> 45:12.747
Gee, let's stop this. We're going to waste the 
tape. Yeah, in other words, we've had a,

45:14.569 --> 45:25.684
interestingly enough, we've had a big repetition 
of Texans on the APA board in the last few years,

45:14.569 --> 45:25.684
including Jim Duncan, myself, Bruce McClendon, 
Roger Hedrick and Adrian Freund. Of course, I

45:31.708 --> 45:34.912
think Adrian Freund came with Jim Duncan from 
Florida. They were in Florida, of course, at the

45:34.953 --> 45:41.521
time, but as a result of their shift over to Texas, 
they became Texas. We have had a very large, in

45:42.282 --> 45:46.728
fact, representation on the board. In fact, a lot 
of times we're called the Texas Contingent. I'm

45:49.011 --> 45:51.314
sure you were called more than that. You were 
probably called the Texas Mafia. Yes, and I think

45:54.014 --> 45:54.915
you're right. There's been some overreaction, 
some reaction to the fact that there's so many

45:54.935 --> 46:00.963
Texans represented on this board. But it's 
probably a shift in geographic geography that has

46:00.983 --> 46:04.867
caused it. But also, people have run, and they've 
been elected. People, I guess, would like us to be

46:07.391 --> 46:09.653
elected to Lopez.

46:13.098 --> 46:16.482
Let's take a look at the chronology of department 
heads, if we can keep this straight. Okay. You

46:18.084 --> 46:18.845
return. So Wolfgang became planning... 
department head in the fall of 1975. Right. And

46:29.391 --> 46:35.578
then, after several years, I'm not quite sure how 
long now. At least four? Four or five. He was

46:37.460 --> 46:41.324
relieved by David Pugh. Right. And David? And 
David continued for two years? Three years? Three

46:47.971 --> 46:48.872
years, I think. Yes, three years. I think three 
years. He was relieved by Don Sweeney. Right. And

46:59.402 --> 47:08.914
Don then began a whole new era in the planning 
department, in my opinion. And unfortunately for

47:11.036 --> 47:19.506
our department, we lost our dean. And he was asked 
to become the interim dean. And so Gordon Echols

47:25.453 --> 47:32.398
was asked to become interim department dean.
