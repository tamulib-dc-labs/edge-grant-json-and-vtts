WEBVTT

00:01.499 --> 00:12.332
The number of college courses that they had to have 
before they were accepted into vet school

00:01.499 --> 00:12.332
increased at a very rapid rate. Did this mean that 
while you were on the student selections

00:12.573 --> 00:25.148
committee, it appeared that the students were 
improving, or did it seem to have any effect at all?

00:29.694 --> 00:30.915
The students who were selected as a rule were the 
ones who had more to show. They had more courses.

00:41.372 --> 00:46.679
Naturally, you're going to take someone who has 
more to offer to you. If he has a degree, so much the

00:47.220 --> 00:49.363
better. And if his work has been good work, 
excellent work, in the four years well that's

00:56.883 --> 01:22.266
that's much more valuable than just a two-year 
student much more valuable if you've had four

00:56.883 --> 01:22.266
years of good grades instead of two years unless 
this person is a very brilliant person with two

00:56.883 --> 01:22.266
years and he is he has made almost a four point grade 
point ratio in the two years And he comes

01:23.393 --> 01:36.189
well-qualified, well-recommended, and you talk 
to instructors he's had on the campus or wherever

01:23.393 --> 01:36.189
he went, and they have recommended him very 
highly. Well, you place a person like that up

01:36.750 --> 01:51.008
against a four-year person, if the four-year 
person, say, had maybe B's or C's in his chemistry

01:36.750 --> 01:51.008
or biology or something like that. I see. Yeah, 
because to me, unless they made good in their

01:53.093 --> 02:05.666
science courses, unless they were strong in 
science and mathematics, I didn't want them. I

02:05.686 --> 02:06.066
see. Chemistry. Is that how your colleagues on the 
committee felt? They all felt the same way about

02:10.551 --> 02:14.215
it. Now, Dr. Davis liked to use the computer. I 
don't know why. I don't understand all I know about

02:19.486 --> 02:23.210
a computer anyway. Well, Dick got with the people 
over in the computer area, and they devised a

02:23.710 --> 02:30.877
method. You'd have to get him to tell you. I 
wouldn't know. But anyway, we had reams and reams

02:34.320 --> 02:39.145
of material from the computer. And Dick would 
evaluate them, every angle that he could think of,

02:39.906 --> 02:48.514
and put it through the computer and come out with a 
list. a computerized list. Well, usually the

02:51.807 --> 02:56.213
thing would tally pretty well with what we had 
selected. Anyway, yeah. Yeah. But we used that to

02:58.556 --> 03:07.348
sort of substantiate if we had to have any 
argument. So I think it worked out very nicely. It

03:14.437 --> 03:16.640
worked out very nicely. There were some students 
who Well, we've had some very good students who

03:18.447 --> 03:27.117
were not very proficient in English. And they made 
a very poor showing on interview. Their language

03:32.244 --> 03:35.467
was horrible. And they just fell completely out 
there. I remember one fellow.

03:44.578 --> 03:48.403
He was worse than some of our athletes with, you 
know, He couldn't say anything but you know.

03:54.622 --> 03:56.123
Otherwise his grades were good. He didn't get in. 
He wore us out with you know, you know, you know. He

04:05.073 --> 04:12.080
couldn't say a word, a phrase or maybe a sentence 
without you knows. I just watched an interview the

04:14.663 --> 04:17.866
other night and I heard exactly that same thing. 
Yes, I did too. with a basketball player. And I

04:24.139 --> 04:27.804
thought, this is a shame. You know where they get

04:28.466 --> 04:32.512
it? I don't know where they get it, but they sure do 
say it. This young man began to work there in the

04:40.625 --> 04:47.196
College of Veterinary Medicine in the 
photographic lab. And I did quite a bit of work down

04:47.868 --> 05:14.804
there preparing my neurology notebook, which I 
want to show

04:47.868 --> 05:14.804
you. We had to get photographic. equipment to do 
this. Back then when we started out in anatomy, you

05:19.253 --> 05:23.958
didn't have any photographic equipment. You 
begin with the gross brain here. That's an old

05:28.563 --> 05:29.884
cow's brain. She's been knocked in the head. 
There's blood all over the lower part of her brain

05:32.187 --> 05:41.616
here in the olfactory area, but here's a side view 
and so on. Well, we went, here's a top, sagittal

05:46.357 --> 06:00.719
section, and then you start with the spinal cord, 
and go on up, go on up here, motor and UTI. Oh, those

06:00.920 --> 06:02.422
are excellent. And on through. Now, who put this 
book together? I did. Oh, really? That's an

06:07.009 --> 06:07.650
outstanding. I did all the photography. I didn't 
know you were an expert at that. See, you go clear on

06:12.077 --> 06:14.541
through the brain stem. Just section, section, 
section. You're up in the medulla oblongata now.

06:19.874 --> 06:23.359
Here's the inferior olive pyramidal tracts. So 
on. Just clear on up. Just section by section. See?

06:28.185 --> 06:32.211
Clear on through the whole brain stem. Here the 
oculomotor nerves there. Third nucleus in here.

06:39.461 --> 06:41.023
And so on. Clear on through it. And you leave a page 
in here for the student to make a note. Now, we had

06:46.873 --> 06:48.856
class sets. And these sections tallied with their 
class sets. I did the sectioning. Brain stem,

06:57.306 --> 07:00.630
these are big sections, about like eight. And 
you've got to have a good sharp knife and know what

07:00.650 --> 07:03.834
you're doing. And Mrs. Craig, my technician, did 
the staining. It's a special Kluver stain. where

07:11.828 --> 07:17.015
the myelin sheath of your nerve fiber stains 
black, see? There's fiber tracks. These are

07:18.758 --> 07:26.188
nuclei, all these light areas, substantia nigra 
here, and so on. And the student then, I would

07:26.208 --> 07:33.858
project the slide on the screen and point out 
everything to him. And he is sitting there with his

07:34.599 --> 07:41.008
microscope, and he has this section in his set. And 
he follows. Excellent idea. Yeah. Follows right

07:48.402 --> 07:49.263
along. He can take his notes right here. He can say 
number one is the medial geniculate body. He can

07:56.555 --> 07:57.777
put a one here. Great idea. And he's got it to study. 
And then when he's through, here we go. We're

08:05.829 --> 08:08.413
getting on up in the brain stem now.

08:11.060 --> 08:14.805
Oh, I think that there's maybe one more. But 
anyhow,

08:14.825 --> 08:22.336
and they say, well, you didn't write anything. 
Well, I wrote a dissertation. I did a

08:24.178 --> 08:32.369
dissertation, and I studied 21,000 sections of 
turkey brain and seven brains that I had

08:24.178 --> 08:32.369
dissected. And I cut, sectioned, and stained, and 
did the whole work. You never did turn out much in

08:36.175 --> 08:39.379
the way of papers writing. What time did I have to 
write or carry on research? Who sharpened all the

08:44.629 --> 08:47.172
microtome knives? I was the only one who ever 
learned how to sharpen a microtome knife. And the

08:51.897 --> 08:59.204
day I retired, I sharpened some knives for Miss 
Craig so she'd have some good sharp knives to go

08:51.897 --> 08:59.204
with. Well, that's a great little booklet. That's 
tremendous. So you do all of your photography. You

09:06.231 --> 09:07.172
do everything. But you took those pictures? I took 
everything. I did all the sectioning. What kind of

09:13.166 --> 09:15.511
camera did you use? We had a micro camera. The 
lenses would enable you to put a 3x2 slide on there

09:21.603 --> 09:29.278
with a section. And you can get the whole thing with 
it. You have a view screen up here. You get it in

09:35.207 --> 09:36.508
focus. Then you slide your cassette in here with 
your film and you take the picture. You have your

09:40.814 --> 09:43.677
lamps and everything. But anyhow,

09:45.800 --> 09:51.266
that's the way it was. There's a question I was 
interested in. Instead of having two or three men

09:55.786 --> 10:02.755
in the department to handle about as many students 
as they have now, while you have 10 or 12.

10:07.461 --> 10:16.913
I should have had that during the speed-up program 
and during the time Dr. Dunn was out when I was

10:07.461 --> 10:16.913
bacteriology and pathology, post-mortem and 
everything. There's something I was interested

10:19.336 --> 10:22.620
in, and that is In the 1960s, we had applicants of 
about 140 or 150 a year, but now we have like 600

10:22.853 --> 10:37.410
people applying to get into med school, or vet 
school here. What a tremendous increase, and I was

10:37.830 --> 10:42.976
wondering what your opinion of why. Well, we had 
those back in the 60s. We had four, five, 600

10:45.900 --> 10:49.524
applicants. Oh, why has it become so popular? I 
couldn't tell you. I really don't know. I don't

10:57.593 --> 10:58.054
know. I guess the big thing is you can make money, 
and that seems to be what the student wants now,

10:58.174 --> 11:07.789
something he can make money with and be his own 
boss.

11:12.055 --> 11:16.822
I would venture to say that in human medicine, it's 
the same way. In law, it's the same way. In

11:19.687 --> 11:20.468
dentistry. They are out for what they can make. 
They want to be rich.

11:28.743 --> 11:30.265
They want to be independent.

11:32.668 --> 11:34.069
Did you want that when you were a student? I wanted a 
living. See, I'm a depression person. And I was

11:41.998 --> 11:48.666
thankful to get a job that paid me $1,500 on a nine 
month basis. I was also very thankful to get a

11:49.692 --> 11:58.137
graduate assistantship at $45 a month because 
otherwise I couldn't have gone.

12:00.845 --> 12:02.470
No way. The first woman was admitted here in vet 
school in 1963, and now they comprise about

12:02.787 --> 12:14.788
one-third, one-third of the student body. 37 and 
Dr. Burns' little book. Do you have one of Dr.

12:17.432 --> 12:19.436
Burns' history? Yeah. Well, he has a tabulation 
there. Were you on this, you were on this Elections

12:24.370 --> 12:27.855
Committee? Yeah, Ms. Oliphant came, yes. We were 
very happy with her. What transpired? She came

12:33.905 --> 12:45.282
very well, recommended by one of the 
veterinarians she'd worked for down there in the

12:33.905 --> 12:45.282
valley, and she was A little wrangler herself. 
This old boy said, whenever I have a mean horse to

12:48.476 --> 12:52.842
break, I get her to break it. Really? Yeah. What's 
her name? What's her name? Oliphant. Her name was

12:56.849 --> 13:00.254
Oliphant. Yeah. She married an old boy. I've 
forgotten. Lee, I believe, was his name. And he was

13:04.720 --> 13:07.725
taking veterinary medicine, too. Anyway, she was 
all right. She was a good student. She carried her

13:11.450 --> 13:13.193
into the stick. I don't believe we've had very many 
girls who have fallen down. They've all done all

13:19.775 --> 13:21.817
right. Why did we change from an all-male school to 
allowing women? Well, the women wanted in

13:28.143 --> 13:31.326
veterinary medicine. The pet angle especially 
practiced with cats and dogs, small animals. That

13:39.114 --> 13:40.395
appealed to them. I guess their motherly 
instincts. It worked out all right, as far as I

13:43.800 --> 13:47.264
know. Is there any pressure from President Rutter 
or any other administrator? No. I don't recall any

13:56.133 --> 13:57.695
pressure. This Miss Oliphant came, she was 
admitted on the basis of graduate student.

14:05.704 --> 14:09.488
Veterinary medicine was considered then more of a 
graduate course. Well, I still think it is. I think

14:12.175 --> 14:17.341
it's actually veterinary medicine is graduate 
school, as far as I'm concerned. Just like in

14:18.102 --> 14:25.352
Galveston, old Dr. Sinclair said to us, you're in 
graduate school. Well, I feel the same way about

14:27.234 --> 14:30.458
veterinary medicine. It's graduate school. Do 
you think there was much resistance with your

14:32.441 --> 14:36.606
colleagues about having ? I couldn't see any 
resistance in veterinary medicine to admission

14:36.856 --> 14:41.442
of women. What was the quality of the women who 
applied back in the early 1960s compared to the

14:43.285 --> 14:48.412
men? Well, women got in and those we took were as 
well qualified as the men.

14:59.807 --> 15:04.213
Because they were people or women who had had or 
they had had contact with animal life for a long

15:05.155 --> 15:15.371
time, and they were well motivated. This is what 
they wanted, and that's all they wanted.

15:23.024 --> 15:26.850
Was there a direct impact after you let women in? I 
mean, did you change the curriculum? Were there

15:28.873 --> 15:30.556
any changes because of that? No, no. No, unless 
they work, unless they study hard. No, they're not

15:38.501 --> 15:39.862
going to make it.

15:43.045 --> 15:52.674
Another thing concerning the so-called 
minorities, another thing that interests me, not

15:43.045 --> 15:52.674
only women, but throughout the years. We've had 
two blacks that I know of up to the time. Why don't

15:59.921 --> 16:00.862
they apply? I don't know. I don't know why. We had 
one black who failed in his anatomy.

16:14.020 --> 16:18.548
He went on to Meharry Medical College and 
graduated as an MD.

16:21.673 --> 16:27.323
We had another black from Galveston, Texas, his 
mother This is in the 1960s? Yeah, his mother was a

16:29.159 --> 16:33.905
maid in a motel.

16:36.469 --> 16:38.712
This old boy came out of the Marine Corps. He had 
been a corporal. I think Rank was a corporal in the

16:39.853 --> 16:44.459
Marine Corps. He came to A&M and took veterinary 
medicine. He had a hard time. But that old boy was

16:49.746 --> 16:51.468
trying. He was struggling. And I think that... 
Well, I'm sure that he had to repeat some courses.

17:00.453 --> 17:07.223
But he finally made it, and he's practicing 
veterinary medicine in California now. He was a

17:07.243 --> 17:08.725
swell fella. Yeah, great big guy. Well built, like 
little Abner. But he made it. He had trouble, but he

17:17.218 --> 17:20.462
made it. He just bit it off and didn't spit it out. He 
stayed with it. You had to admire that rascal.

17:31.795 --> 17:34.738
Were there very many who applied when you were on 
the selections committee? No. A strange thing. I

17:36.900 --> 17:37.401
don't know why. I guess they found out that it was so 
difficult, I suppose. But yet there are many of

17:43.948 --> 17:46.911
them in human medicine. But veterinary medicine 
somehow or other just doesn't appeal. And I don't

17:54.175 --> 17:56.417
know why it is. It would seem to me that if a person is 
reared on a farm, as many of them were, that they

17:56.637 --> 18:09.409
would be interested in veterinary medicine, in 
animals. But that's not the case.

18:14.995 --> 18:19.659
We would like to have some real good students in the 
minorities. It's the same way with the

18:20.920 --> 18:23.743
Spanish-Americans. We've had a few. Most of them 
we've had have been real good students.

18:33.810 --> 18:40.579
I don't know, but maybe a handful of Latin 
Americans. But they've been good students. In

18:42.341 --> 18:44.484
fact, I think we have one out there now. Out of the 
veterinary corps, he became a colonel.

18:53.656 --> 18:54.237
What's his name? Trevino, Trevino, he finally 
got, he has a PhD in pathology, and so on. He's on the

19:04.175 --> 19:05.156
staff now? Yeah, he's retired from the veterinary 
corps, he's on the staff now, yeah. Oh, good for

19:09.980 --> 19:10.541
him. But a good student, excellent. Now as far as 
research is concerned at Texas A&M, I was

19:14.284 --> 19:25.253
wondering what you considered to be the strengths 
and the weaknesses of the, research in the vet

19:25.520 --> 19:30.226
school?

19:30.246 --> 19:39.579
Well, actually in anatomy, what research we did 
was

19:30.246 --> 19:39.579
laughable. Well, actually we didn't do very much. 
It was more of a teaching department. It was more of

19:46.368 --> 19:49.392
a teaching department as long as I was with it. But 
they are doing research now. We were beginning

19:55.642 --> 19:57.885
before I left. But up to that time, I think you could 
say we were building. Yeah. What were the great

20:04.154 --> 20:09.642
research institutions by the time you left in the 
early 1970s?

20:11.424 --> 20:12.326
In the A&M? No, no. What were the great in the 
country?

20:20.157 --> 20:23.742
Well, you'd have to put it down to medical schools 
mostly. I don't think veterinary schools were

20:24.464 --> 20:27.508
doing very much. I don't recall. Cornell, 
probably, and Michigan State, Iowa State, to me,

20:28.329 --> 20:36.499
were outstanding.

20:39.042 --> 20:40.304
Or maybe Minnesota. Put Minnesota in there. But 
not Texas A&M. This is a more recent development.

20:48.574 --> 20:53.340
You see, up to as long as we had a division of 
veterinary science. in the experiment station.

20:57.911 --> 21:00.435
All of the research work was done there. In fact, 
that's all they did, was all they were supposed to

21:01.577 --> 21:05.883
do. They did the research. We did the teaching. And 
this went on up to as long as Dr. Schmidt was there in

21:09.268 --> 21:18.121
veterinary research. Dr. Turk, who was 
parasitology head for so long, he started out.

21:23.780 --> 21:28.004
been there, science, Dr. Schmidt, and so on. Well, 
that's the way it was, and up until the time that

21:28.024 --> 21:41.417
D.W. Williams came on as vice president, and was he 
president? D.W. Or just acting. Anyhow, he

21:45.982 --> 21:51.627
started the breakdown of the research in one area 
and teaching in the other. He wanted it mixed up. He

21:58.112 --> 22:06.800
was the one who, as far as I know, began breaking it 
down so that we'd have research and teaching.

22:11.003 --> 22:12.565
I think it's come quite a ways. I know they have 
maybe a $300,000 research program in anatomy now.

22:20.652 --> 22:21.613
In monkeys? Well,

22:22.150 --> 22:26.896
we were beginning. I know we were beginning to make 
brain stem sections and spinal cord sections of

22:26.916 --> 22:47.382
baboons and different types of monkeys so that we 
would be prepared if we needed to study anything in

22:48.526 --> 22:59.084
the central nervous system, we'd have sections of 
central nervous system for comparison to any

22:48.526 --> 22:59.084
pathology or anatomical changes.

23:06.316 --> 23:12.506
Well, I'm well pleased that they have an 
opportunity, and I'm pleased, too, that we have

23:06.316 --> 23:12.506
sufficient faculty. Right, to carry on. When you 
had two or three men in your teaching, good

23:15.813 --> 23:21.358
heavens. No, nine different courses, don't 
forget it. Impossible. Now, the archives put me up

23:26.683 --> 23:34.509
to this question, and I don't know anything about 
this group, but they said I should ask you because

23:26.683 --> 23:34.509
you might. And that is, during the 1950s, I guess, 
there was a group called the True Texans, the

23:35.410 --> 23:42.536
Tonqua tribe? The Tonqua tribe. Can you tell me 
about them? I don't know anything about these

23:45.914 --> 23:47.716
people. Well, Dr. Morgan called me one day and 
asked me if I wouldn't be on a committee to try some

23:47.736 --> 24:02.277
of these students who were found out to be 
Tawankawa tribes. He said, we need some good

24:04.480 --> 24:06.924
Aggies. Well,

24:14.167 --> 24:17.730
I said, yes, I don't mind being on the committee. So 
I was. Penberthy was chairman.

24:25.817 --> 24:32.203
They had put a,

24:25.817 --> 24:32.203
what would you call him? A person had joined the TTs 
and was making their meetings. And he got a hold of

24:38.928 --> 24:43.212
the little black book, the registry. where 
they're supposed to sign their names in blood and

24:43.664 --> 24:47.769
all that. And you'd be surprised that the names 
were read out at the meeting, people who belonged

24:49.451 --> 24:58.583
to the TTs. Well, as a military school, we were not 
supposed to have any fraternities, secret

25:00.084 --> 25:07.133
societies. Felborden? No, no. But evidently they 
had two. the Tawankawa tribes and the Swastikas.

25:16.863 --> 25:18.225
Yeah. So. This is after the Second World War, the 
Swastikas? Yeah. And then before the war, this

25:22.612 --> 25:25.476
goes way back. I know way back in the 20s, they still 
had the Tawankawa tribe and the Swastikas. It was

25:32.527 --> 25:36.312
named long before Hitler. I don't know whether 
they kept the Swastikas after Hitler came on the

25:36.332 --> 25:41.380
line. But the TTs were here. In fact, I suppose the 
TTs have been around since A&M began. I have an old

25:53.891 --> 25:58.976
captain's chair over here that came out of the old 
chemistry lecture room. A picture was taken in

25:59.537 --> 26:01.438
1904. And I want to show you something that's 
carved on the arm. You're talking about the TTs?

26:10.967 --> 26:11.788
We're lucky here.

26:16.730 --> 26:18.413
You see a TT there? That's their sign. That's their 
brand. That's their brand. It's Texas Tech now,

26:24.844 --> 26:28.530
but the Toronto tribe there. And that old chair 
came from the Kim lecture room. And I have a picture

26:32.257 --> 26:35.082
that was taken in 1940. These old captain's chairs 
in there. It was in the old amphitheater. in the old

26:42.110 --> 26:52.183
chemistry building that stood where the library, 
the Cushing Library was built.

26:52.784 --> 26:56.709
What was their function, or what was their 
purpose? Well, when they read off the list of

26:56.729 --> 27:11.408
names, I found out that an old B Troop cavalry, my 
captain was a T.T. His top kick was a TT. The colonel

27:14.173 --> 27:19.699
of the cadet corps was a TT. And I don't know how many 
colonels of the cadet corps that were read off

27:20.880 --> 27:28.769
through the years were TTs.

27:31.492 --> 27:39.201
And evidently, it was playing a part in military 
appointments.

27:39.361 --> 27:41.023
I know I had one. When I was a freshman, there was a 
senior who played football. He led it. But he told

27:49.209 --> 27:54.718
me, he said, Fish, I want to tell you something. 
You're going to be around here several more years.

27:59.145 --> 28:07.278
But unless you belong to a secret fraternity, an 
organization like that, you're not going to

27:59.145 --> 28:07.278
amount to anything. He said, I don't belong. But I 
had an awful time making a letter. Said the guys who

28:14.680 --> 28:18.164
were fraternity men made letters. But I had an 
awful time.

28:22.931 --> 28:24.473
That old boy is dead now, too. Well, what did the TTs 
believe in?

28:29.120 --> 28:32.485
Well, to me, it was more of a social organization. 
They had dances and such as that and parties off

28:33.226 --> 28:38.213
campus. So. Had to be wealthy, didn't it? Well, 
they had to be socialites in a way. They had to. Why

28:50.928 --> 28:52.950
did they name themselves the True Texans? I don't 
know. I don't know where the name Tawanka was. It

28:56.976 --> 28:58.177
wasn't True Texans. It was Tawanka with tribe. Oh. 
So True Texans is not the name. Well, one of the

29:04.045 --> 29:06.208
members of that committee was a TT and he was common 
of the cadet he was common of cadets at A&M old Joe

29:07.589 --> 29:30.407
Davis he went he went from here to uh Stephenville 
to Tarleton

29:07.589 --> 29:30.407
in general then it was a social organization or a 
social club and And in fact,

29:30.944 --> 29:45.924
from the reading off of the names, I don't know 
what's ever become of the little black book, but

29:30.944 --> 29:45.924
the chairman of the board of directors of Texas A&M 
College's name was read off. And at that time, he

29:46.885 --> 29:49.689
was chairman of the board.

29:54.134 --> 29:54.976
Did you ever join? No, sir. Why not? I wasn't a 
socialite. I didn't have money.

30:05.927 --> 30:09.229
Oh, and I didn't intend to graduate from A&M 
either. I was going to take my pre-med and go on,

30:09.249 --> 30:13.693
which I did, but I came back. But I will say this for 
the TTs.

30:20.439 --> 30:24.203
They were made up of good men. And when I went back, 
the dean of the College of Veterinary Medicine at

30:24.223 --> 30:29.267
that time was a his name was read off too out of the 
little black book and was this just for students or

30:30.277 --> 30:58.697
was it for it was just for students it was just for 
students and then many of these people had aspired

30:30.277 --> 30:58.697
on yeah i don't know where the little black book 
went as far as i'm concerned why the tt was made up of

30:30.277 --> 30:58.697
damn good men because i didn't know that it wasn't a 
name it was read off it wasn't an outstanding

30:30.277 --> 30:58.697
personality And all I can say is hooray for the TTs. 
Does it still exist today? They were supposed to

31:04.424 --> 31:06.567
break up that year. What year was that? Disband. 
Oh, I don't know when Dr. Morgan was president back

31:08.569 --> 31:12.815
in there in the 60s. It wasn't Bill Armistead was 
dean. It was... Oh, don't you have a... Well, let's

31:18.002 --> 31:22.128
see. Yeah, I can find out when that was, yeah. 
Mm-hmm.

31:29.272 --> 31:30.237
Oh, I don't know. They said yes. Why did they 
investigate?
