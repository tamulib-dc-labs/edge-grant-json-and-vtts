00:02.039 --> 00:03.361
the Air Force as a career.

00:04.964 --> 00:09.272
Very early on, my brother was already in the Air Force, and all I wanted to do was be a pilot in the Air Force.

00:14.081 --> 00:18.890
So I went into the Air Force in the Corps, and all I wanted to do was fly.

00:18.910 --> 00:21.094
I wanted to be an aerospace engineer and go fly jets.

00:21.412 --> 00:36.923
As it turned out, my eyes weren't good enough, and my junior year, I got a contract my junior year that I busted my physical for flying, but was qualified to get on active duty, and took it again and busted it again for eyes.

00:37.966 --> 00:42.673
So I went on active duty out to Vandenberg Air Force Base as an engineer launching satellites.

00:43.875 --> 00:48.422
And I graduated with my master's in 69, went on active duty.

00:48.662 --> 00:54.812
And in 71, I took the physical again, and at that time they were waving to 2050.

00:54.952 --> 00:57.716
It's amazing what happens when a war goes on.

00:58.417 --> 01:00.801
So I qualified and went off to pilot training.

01:01.625 --> 01:09.155
And what did being an Aggie in terms of background, how did that help you?

01:09.956 --> 01:15.964
Oh, it helped me tremendously in pilot training, and I've talked to a lot of Ags about this also.

01:16.906 --> 01:19.830
You're much better prepared for the environment, for the pressure environment.

01:20.170 --> 01:23.835
Pilot training is a mental thing more than anything else.

01:23.815 --> 01:25.777
You're not afraid of hurting yourself.

01:26.398 --> 01:27.919
You're afraid of not doing well.

01:30.642 --> 01:34.366
You know, it's kind of like the old fighter pilot's prayer, oh, God, don't let me screw up.

01:35.567 --> 01:45.136
And so you're used to, I think you're a little bit better prepared for the mental pressure, and you can separate the bullshit from the reality.

01:46.057 --> 01:52.624
And, you know, Aggies in general do fairly well in pilot training.

01:54.697 --> 01:57.361
You are in the Corps all four years.

02:00.185 --> 02:06.294
Was there someone that you, as a junior or senior, you began to turn to for advice?

02:06.374 --> 02:08.297
Any faculty member?

02:09.939 --> 02:14.225
Yeah, Dr. Oh, shoot.

02:20.074 --> 02:21.756
Dr. Rodenberger in the Aero Department.

02:23.178 --> 02:24.400
The road.

02:24.818 --> 02:25.218
Yeah.

02:27.481 --> 02:34.008
Turned to him, and then he became the chairman of my committee when I stayed and got my master's.

02:34.028 --> 02:43.138
They're a bunch of good profs over Dr. Lowy, or not even Dr. Professor Lowy in the Air Department.

02:45.081 --> 02:46.162
Yeah, some good folks over there.

02:47.824 --> 02:53.610
But Dr. Rodenberger was probably the key guy I dealt with on the family.

02:55.193 --> 03:09.675
As you are heading toward your senior year,

03:10.786 --> 03:12.628
You're still in the same outfit.

03:13.368 --> 03:17.112
What core responsibilities did you have that fourth year?

03:17.432 --> 03:20.555
I was a flight officer my senior year.

03:21.316 --> 03:30.945
Again, the academic load was such that anything beyond that was, I mean, I was there.

03:31.065 --> 03:32.806
I was paying for my own college education.

03:32.826 --> 03:34.388
All right.

03:34.408 --> 03:37.391
Of all the courses you took, which ones were the most important?

03:38.972 --> 03:40.033
Looking back on it now.

03:41.482 --> 03:42.984
The most important?

03:43.024 --> 03:50.615
Well, actually, the automation courses were actually, to me now, the most important.

03:50.796 --> 04:00.229
As it turned out, when I graduated from college with a master's degree in aerospace engineering in 1969, there were 40,000 unemployed aerospace engineers in the country.

04:00.250 --> 04:03.234
I don't know if you remember back at that time, we'd already landed on the moon.

04:04.596 --> 04:09.463
There was a tremendous winding down of the aerospace industry, and there were even

04:09.916 --> 04:15.641
stories on the nightly news of PhD aerospace engineers flipping burgers at McDonald's.

04:17.523 --> 04:21.166
And so I went into the Air Force and then of course ended up going to pilot training.

04:21.186 --> 04:26.170
Probably that's about the closest I ever came to aerospace engineering was flying jets in the Air Force.

04:26.651 --> 04:37.220
But I took my first automation course in my junior year and really got turned on by automation because of the things you could do.

04:37.260 --> 04:39.602
It ended up my

04:40.527 --> 04:49.061
Both my senior project and my master's revolved around modeling, computer modeling of different things.

04:50.023 --> 04:58.316
And computers became a hobby and now I'm a vice president of an engineering company and I'm in charge of all the systems development.

04:58.737 --> 05:01.962
So automation has become part of the major part of my career.

05:02.178 --> 05:06.954
Were we, for that time, were we comparatively up to date?

05:07.074 --> 05:07.897
Oh, absolutely.

05:07.957 --> 05:10.686
We had some of the best IBM

05:11.375 --> 05:19.046
equipment, it was a, when I started we had a 70s, 7094 was the mainframe and then we got a 360 and the 360 was really the hot engine at the time.

05:19.066 --> 05:24.454
We had a super computer facility, the DPC, data processing center, DPC.

05:27.219 --> 05:31.104
And IBM had put a lot of people on the campus.

05:31.725 --> 05:36.893
I can remember a lot of professors that were former IBM or so.

05:37.210 --> 05:43.319
And it was a top notch place and got a really good automation education.

05:43.560 --> 05:51.552
As you, looking back again, were there any omissions that A&M didn't do that we should have done?

05:54.457 --> 05:59.965
No, I think it was, if anybody would say that would be maybe not taking advantage of what was there.

06:00.987 --> 06:02.689
I thought it was a tremendous education.

06:03.030 --> 06:04.973
And it was appropriately,

06:05.189 --> 06:09.336
real world as compared to being entirely theoretical.

06:10.538 --> 06:13.583
Which I think was a very positive thing.

06:13.623 --> 06:22.237
A&M produced people who could go out into the world and pick up a wrench and make something happen.

06:23.299 --> 06:31.332
And even today, my son graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering technology, which is a major program at A&M.

06:31.733 --> 06:35.918
The MET people, everybody's jumping after the MET people.

06:35.938 --> 06:38.260
Of course, the downturn of the economy recently has kind of messed things up.

06:38.280 --> 06:51.074
But people look upon graduates in that program and from A&M in general as people who can go out and make things happen, not who are going to sit and mull over what's the latest theoretical thing.

06:51.134 --> 06:53.577
A&M produces leaders.

06:54.338 --> 06:56.340
A&M produces people who make things happen.

06:56.860 --> 07:00.404
Senior ring.

07:00.925 --> 07:01.546
Oh, big deal.

07:01.666 --> 07:02.547
How much did it cost?

07:02.808 --> 07:03.629
$37.50.

07:03.689 --> 07:08.775
I probably haven't said that number and I can't remember when.

07:08.855 --> 07:10.717
How did you feel when you put it on?

07:10.738 --> 07:16.905
Oh, God, you feel it's just the greatest day in the world.

07:16.945 --> 07:19.889
You go over the association and you get your ring and you put it on.

07:20.670 --> 07:22.232
There's a little story in our family.

07:22.853 --> 07:25.416
My brother bought my ring.

07:27.117 --> 07:29.501
He's class of 57, I'm class of 60.

07:29.521 --> 07:30.423
He bought my ring.

07:31.564 --> 07:37.114
Then my nephew, John McDonald, who's class of 93, when he graduated, I bought his ring.

07:39.017 --> 07:47.792
Then John bought, John is, John went into the Marine Corps and got out and now he's a, he's a manager with Dell in Austin.

07:47.812 --> 07:48.653
Doing very well.

07:49.173 --> 07:54.838
um then John bought my oldest son Doug's ring for class of 99.

07:54.878 --> 07:56.666
Never heard of that before.

07:56.687 --> 07:58.153
And now here shortly

07:59.348 --> 08:01.170
Doug will buy Nick's ring.

08:01.811 --> 08:03.594
Nick gets his ring this semester.

08:04.134 --> 08:05.496
In fact, he just called me the other day.

08:05.516 --> 08:06.377
He said, Dad, I can't believe it.

08:06.397 --> 08:09.241
This semester I get my ring in my boots.

08:09.261 --> 08:11.064
So this is our tradition in our family.

08:12.205 --> 08:16.551
Each one buys the next one, so there's an unbroken chain of people buying the rings.

08:17.312 --> 08:19.255
Some good ring stories you have to share?

08:21.798 --> 08:26.184
Somebody that saw it in some unusual place, you lost it.

08:26.264 --> 08:29.288
No, God forbid they ever lost it.

08:29.858 --> 08:33.368
The interesting thing, I use the ring a lot in recruiting.

08:35.273 --> 08:41.590
You know, as I talk to high school students and such and talk about the importance of the ring.

08:42.262 --> 08:48.469
And even, particularly if we've got females present, they're wearing the ring and how important the ring is to everybody.

08:49.270 --> 08:52.914
People who, it's obviously another thing on the inside looking at it, you can't explain it.

08:52.955 --> 08:54.336
Outside looking at it, you can't understand it.

08:54.797 --> 09:02.245
They don't understand why we hold the ring as important as we do and why it's such a big deal to get it and why it's all the same.

09:02.906 --> 09:03.827
There's no differences.

09:04.748 --> 09:07.291
And see, I think that's the key part.

09:07.311 --> 09:07.932
Oh, yeah.

09:08.030 --> 09:13.458
that doesn't matter what year, doesn't matter what you major, it's recognizable.

09:13.478 --> 09:14.199
It's recognized.

09:14.499 --> 09:25.614
And like I said, I can remember times being in Japan or Germany or all over the world and seeing a ring and walking up to somebody.

09:25.935 --> 09:29.700
In fact, I was with some folks in Japan one time and I

09:30.305 --> 09:35.012
saw a ring and went over and introduced myself to the guy and we talked for a few minutes and came back to my friends and they say, oh, you know that guy?

09:35.032 --> 09:36.515
I said, no.

09:36.535 --> 09:37.516
They said, why'd you go talk to him?

09:37.536 --> 09:38.317
I said, because he's an Aggie.

09:38.918 --> 09:40.280
You know, it doesn't make any difference.

09:40.300 --> 09:41.622
There's no class distinction or anything.

09:41.642 --> 09:42.444
You're a meeting friend.

09:43.125 --> 09:53.360
In your years of active duty, what other schools had the ring, I guess the academies?

09:53.801 --> 09:54.442
The academies do.

09:54.462 --> 09:58.388
They refer to the Air Force Academy

09:59.009 --> 10:04.959
people as ring knockers, you know, I don't know that there's, well, they're not.

10:05.339 --> 10:06.762
They don't compare to Aggies.

10:14.334 --> 10:26.113
And that's a whole different thing too, is my life in the military, the relationship with Aggies is totally different than graduates of other military schools.

10:26.988 --> 10:33.255
It has to do with the class camaraderie and everything else.

10:37.581 --> 10:39.263
Senior boots, how much did they cost?

10:39.283 --> 10:40.304
$100.

10:40.384 --> 10:41.686
And where did you get them?

10:41.806 --> 10:42.487
Got them from Lupo's.

10:43.828 --> 10:46.591
Did you ever meet Lupo?

10:46.912 --> 10:47.533
Old Army Lou?

10:48.313 --> 10:49.435
Did I say Lupo?

10:49.715 --> 10:51.357
Not Lupo's.

10:52.879 --> 10:53.640
Not Lupo's.

10:53.700 --> 10:55.242
They're at Northgate.

10:55.262 --> 10:56.303
Yeah, Northgate.

10:56.536 --> 10:57.437
God, wait a minute.

10:58.419 --> 11:00.702
Oh, boy.

11:01.263 --> 11:01.643
Yeah.

11:01.663 --> 11:02.425
My brain's gone dead.

11:02.445 --> 11:03.586
Yeah, my brain's gone dead.

11:04.247 --> 11:06.531
Not lupos, but... We've been making them for 100 years.

11:06.571 --> 11:07.812
Yeah.

11:10.977 --> 11:11.498
We'll get it later.

11:11.518 --> 11:12.359
Yeah, we'll get back to it.

11:12.379 --> 11:13.140
You know, I got them there.

11:13.160 --> 11:13.741
I got them made.

11:14.222 --> 11:17.987
Went in and... Holix.

11:18.288 --> 11:18.889
Holix, yeah.

11:19.069 --> 11:19.429
Holix.

11:21.793 --> 11:22.995
Went in there, picked out the leather.

11:23.635 --> 11:25.378
Had really dark leather.

11:26.287 --> 11:29.471
The leather's, oh, shoot.

11:29.952 --> 11:32.456
It's a dark, dark color.

11:32.476 --> 11:38.464
And my son wore those boots, and my youngest son just took them and was going to wear those boots.

11:39.245 --> 11:40.186
So they're still going.

11:40.647 --> 11:42.630
But, yeah, went into Hollicks, had them made.

11:44.973 --> 11:47.777
Now, did you buy a saber as a senior?

11:48.138 --> 11:48.939
Yeah, I bought a saber.

11:49.199 --> 11:51.202
All of us in the outfit bought sabers.

11:51.242 --> 11:52.564
Where'd you get them?

11:52.624 --> 11:54.927
Got them at Northgate at...

11:55.379 --> 11:59.945
I got mine at the University Bookstore.

12:00.266 --> 12:02.749
There was a bookstore at Northgate.

12:02.770 --> 12:04.071
Yeah.

12:04.131 --> 12:05.674
One of the ones up there, I bought it there.

12:05.694 --> 12:06.515
Did that cost much?

12:07.697 --> 12:13.585
I think the Sabre was 75 to 100 bucks.

12:13.605 --> 12:14.506
I can't remember for sure.

12:14.546 --> 12:15.107
Did you keep it?

12:15.387 --> 12:15.728
Oh, yes.

12:16.249 --> 12:18.171
And both of my sons have used it.

12:18.211 --> 12:20.695
In fact, it's at A&M right now.

12:21.434 --> 12:27.379
When you go through Final Review as a junior, what's the feeling?

12:29.201 --> 12:33.805
Well, that's just an awesome feeling because you know you're going to go back and put your boots on.

12:37.388 --> 12:39.170
Final Review is one of those bittersweet things.

12:39.210 --> 12:42.112
I don't know that today is like it was then.

12:42.613 --> 12:45.235
I can remember guys crying at Final Review.

12:47.117 --> 12:47.697
The seniors.

12:48.438 --> 12:50.580
In those days, the seniors,

12:51.387 --> 12:52.648
It's a little bit different from today.

12:52.688 --> 12:57.714
The seniors formed the line at the far south end of the drill field, and you marched by.

12:58.735 --> 13:02.278
And as each outfit marched by, the seniors would step forward and salute their outfit.

13:02.999 --> 13:08.024
And I can remember guys stepping out with tears in their eyes as you marched by.

13:08.064 --> 13:16.213
Our senior year, what we did is all of us in the front rank wore sabers.

13:16.295 --> 13:22.725
And so we all did a saber salute as we passed in review.

13:23.706 --> 13:24.327
All right.

13:24.347 --> 13:31.899
Your senior year, who came for final review for you, your family and loved ones?

13:31.939 --> 13:39.450
My father and my stepmother and my wife-to-be and my uncle, Charlie Gaynor.

13:40.392 --> 13:46.818
whose Gaynor Haldarm 5 is named after his father, who was Senator Gaynor.

13:48.599 --> 13:54.625
And my brother, of course, who was in the Air Force at the time.

13:54.645 --> 13:55.906
What were your thoughts on that day?

13:55.946 --> 13:58.068
What did you think your future was going to be?

13:59.789 --> 14:03.032
Well, I knew I was going into military, and I knew Vietnam was going on.

14:03.833 --> 14:09.538
So, you know, I knew it was going to involve something like that.

14:10.143 --> 14:11.244
But not with apprehension.

14:11.304 --> 14:18.171
I think there was great enthusiasm and anticipation about getting out in the world.

14:18.211 --> 14:21.193
And in my case, I knew I was staying there to get my master's degree.

14:22.655 --> 14:28.660
So it was just going back to school, really.

14:28.680 --> 14:31.363
It was just getting out of the court and becoming a civilian, becoming a non-reg.

14:31.763 --> 14:32.744
Was the weather OK?

14:33.765 --> 14:36.808
Oh, just great in College Station all the time.

14:37.193 --> 14:43.259
I mean, and the interesting thing, of course, I talked about the fact that in the dorms when I lived my freshman year where they were on air condition.

14:43.279 --> 14:43.379
Sure.

14:43.399 --> 14:48.044
And, geez.

14:48.064 --> 14:50.046
Was that something else in September or in May?

14:51.208 --> 15:06.103
I keep remembering in Houston when I was at Rice, Alvin Van Black, who was one of the DJs for KTRH, a lady called one day and said, Alvin, how did y'all live in Houston before air conditioning?

15:06.337 --> 15:08.400
And he said, more slowly.

15:11.244 --> 15:12.746
Well, in my case, we had an attic fan.

15:12.766 --> 15:13.406
Yeah, there you go.

15:13.527 --> 15:14.828
And if you were rich, you had an attic fan.

15:14.888 --> 15:17.252
That's it.

15:17.392 --> 15:20.316
I can remember another little side story, real quick thing.

15:20.376 --> 15:26.764
I can remember in the summertime when my window would have the window open and the wind would come in there and he would collect flies.

15:27.185 --> 15:29.328
And there was this lizard that used to get on the screen.

15:29.348 --> 15:33.373
Every morning, the lizard would be there and he'd work his way down the screen cleaning off the flies.

15:34.703 --> 15:36.705
People air-conditioned don't understand those stories.

15:37.185 --> 15:37.726
Commencement.

15:38.326 --> 15:41.129
Why are A&M Commencements special also?

15:41.649 --> 15:42.890
Well, you know what's interesting?

15:44.452 --> 16:02.668
When I went to my son's graduation, and mine the same way, you know, you don't see weird, I mean, of course now you're starting to see some students come in with weird stuff on their hats and that sort of stuff, but you still, they're dressed in caps and gowns and everything, and of course you've got the Corps graduating in uniform.

16:03.172 --> 16:07.336
I think a degree, the kids who go to A&M, the degree means something.

16:07.357 --> 16:08.978
They went to A&M because it means something.

16:09.219 --> 16:11.040
There's that conservative attitude at A&M.

16:12.562 --> 16:14.504
Commencement is a major thing.

16:14.704 --> 16:16.306
And let me tell you an interesting story.

16:16.506 --> 16:22.413
My son's graduation, there was a woman from Atlanta who was the speaker.

16:24.655 --> 16:32.824
And she said, when she stepped up the podium, she said, what's up?

16:35.082 --> 16:38.165
And everybody just kind of sat there and looked at her.

16:40.028 --> 16:43.472
And I guess on some other campuses, the whole student body would have done a WhatsApp back.

16:43.492 --> 16:45.374
Nobody said a word.

16:45.534 --> 16:46.355
And she said it again.

16:46.395 --> 16:47.796
And she said it one more time.

16:48.597 --> 16:49.739
And nobody responded.

16:51.120 --> 16:53.563
Because I think to them, this was a solemn moment.

16:53.723 --> 16:54.985
I'm graduating from college.

16:55.065 --> 16:56.506
My parents have done this.

16:56.606 --> 16:57.367
And they're all here.

16:57.447 --> 16:58.188
And my family's here.

16:58.208 --> 16:59.530
And I'm not going to make an idiot out of myself.

17:00.190 --> 17:02.473
And it was really an interesting thing.

17:04.360 --> 17:07.946
Did you ever hear of any hijinks or pranks at an A&M commencement?

17:08.207 --> 17:08.627
I never did.

17:08.768 --> 17:11.232
No, never have, never have.

17:11.292 --> 17:12.474
It's a big moment.

17:12.534 --> 17:13.476
It's like going to church.

17:15.780 --> 17:20.147
And your diploma was in that tube.

17:20.468 --> 17:23.212
My diploma was in that tube, yeah.

17:23.373 --> 17:24.715
And nobody walked out.

17:25.015 --> 17:26.657
No, no.

17:26.677 --> 17:27.878
See, that's one of the problems now.

17:27.898 --> 17:28.638
I know, I know.

17:28.718 --> 17:29.179
I've noticed that.

17:29.219 --> 17:31.041
People get their degree and walk out.

17:31.061 --> 17:33.142
Yeah, I ran into that at Missouri in large numbers.

17:33.503 --> 17:33.603
Yeah.

17:33.903 --> 17:39.949
I skipped over one question a while ago.

17:40.049 --> 17:41.630
Muster, did you go to Muster on campus?

17:41.650 --> 17:41.991
Oh, absolutely.

17:42.011 --> 17:42.291
Absolutely.

17:42.331 --> 17:49.437
Muster in those days was held out in front of the administration building, and you'd sit out there on the grass, and the ceremony was there.

17:50.198 --> 17:50.699
Oh, absolutely.

17:50.719 --> 17:52.600
I mean, that was like, again, like going to church.

17:52.640 --> 17:54.482
I mean, that was, you went to Muster.

17:54.935 --> 17:57.158
Is that part of building Aggie spirit?

17:57.359 --> 17:58.200
Oh, absolutely.

17:58.380 --> 18:03.067
What are the events that contribute most to building that spirit?

18:03.288 --> 18:19.052
Well, Silver Taps and Muster, Trothman, the Corps, the Band.

18:20.753 --> 18:22.555
All those special things.

18:22.575 --> 18:23.697
Probably silver taps and muster.

18:23.977 --> 18:25.539
I talk about that a lot in recruiting.

18:28.783 --> 18:34.790
You know, I talk about silver taps and the fact that everybody comes out and there's total silence.

18:34.950 --> 18:37.674
You know, you've got thousands and thousands of students in absolute silence.

18:39.015 --> 18:46.845
And the fact that the buglers play taps three times to the north, to the west, and to the south.

18:47.095 --> 18:50.981
And they don't play it to the east because the sun will never rise on those Aggies again.

18:51.001 --> 18:59.994
And they kind of, the people I'm telling this to, it kind of shocks them, you know, and you can see tears starting to come to their eyes and everything else.

19:00.014 --> 19:09.448
And then Muster, of course, talking about, you know, calling out the names and somebody answers here to signify that they're present in spirit.

19:09.468 --> 19:11.651
And nobody else does anything like that.

19:11.671 --> 19:14.115
Um... Um...

19:16.120 --> 19:17.302
And it's kind of interesting.

19:17.362 --> 19:19.284
I was talking to people down at New Mexico Military Institute.

19:19.305 --> 19:33.605
They have a kind of ceremony like that where once a year they call out the names of all, and they turn out a candle or something like that to signify they're gone.

19:33.925 --> 19:35.327
It's exactly the opposite thing at Muster.

19:35.347 --> 19:36.489
You say here that they're there.

19:37.590 --> 19:39.453
You know, they're there in spirit, that they're always there.

19:39.473 --> 19:40.374
I gotta tell you a story.

19:41.256 --> 19:45.081
At Muster, about 10 years ago here in town,

19:46.259 --> 19:55.257
We were all assembling to get ready, and there was a young woman I saw there, and she was kind of walking around like she didn't know anybody.

19:56.820 --> 20:01.028
And I walked up to her and I said, I'm Doug Farada, class of 67, and she said, my name is Morley Johnson.

20:02.358 --> 20:04.080
And I said, well, she didn't give me a class year.

20:04.100 --> 20:06.202
So I said, you know, you didn't go to A&M?

20:06.542 --> 20:07.804
And she said, no, I didn't.

20:07.824 --> 20:09.525
I said, well, why are you here at Muster?

20:09.545 --> 20:11.828
And she said, well, I've known some Aggies and heard about Muster.

20:11.848 --> 20:13.169
And I said, well, would you like to join us?

20:13.890 --> 20:14.671
And she said, yes.

20:14.851 --> 20:15.772
And she sat with us.

20:16.613 --> 20:24.221
And we told her about Muster and Silver Taps and 12th Man and the band and Midnight Yell practice and all that other stuff.

20:24.501 --> 20:26.944
And then came the formal part of the ceremony.

20:28.405 --> 20:29.226
And we stood up.

20:30.218 --> 20:34.689
And the first name called was Knox T. Johnson, class of 50.

20:35.231 --> 20:37.196
And she answered, here for her father.

20:40.303 --> 20:41.146
I still worry, go.

20:41.346 --> 20:42.248
Heavy, heavy.

20:42.268 --> 20:42.810
I mean, no.

20:43.351 --> 20:44.093
She knew.

20:44.444 --> 20:48.550
that her dad wanted her to do that.

20:49.010 --> 20:49.951
Oh, my, yes.

20:51.013 --> 20:55.599
All right, let me give you a lot to people.

20:55.679 --> 21:06.594
And one of the things that we do here is that, like this young man who called tonight, Lynn Ott, talking about her son, Alex, who's interested in A&M, we'll invite them to muster.

21:06.994 --> 21:08.196
Sure, sure.

21:08.216 --> 21:14.164
And I had a young woman last year that came to muster who, you know, was...

21:14.701 --> 21:20.729
didn't know where she wanted to go to school, and after that she came up to me and she said, thank you very much for letting me come.

21:21.590 --> 21:24.153
Why are Aggies so loyal to the institution?

21:26.676 --> 21:34.206
I liken it to a cult or a religion, you know, and that's really the closest you can get.

21:34.366 --> 21:43.678
I think it has to do with values, it has to do with

21:45.211 --> 21:47.714
a common background.

21:47.754 --> 21:50.256
I think it has to do a lot with the rural nature of the school.

21:51.358 --> 21:53.440
When you go to A&M, that's it.

21:53.460 --> 21:54.361
That's your universe.

21:54.621 --> 21:56.103
And you make such good friends there.

21:57.444 --> 21:59.506
It's such a wholesome, great environment.

22:02.069 --> 22:04.332
But it is amazing looking into loyalty.

22:04.512 --> 22:10.358
I guess it's one of those great unexplainable things, but it's almost like a religion.

22:12.076 --> 22:15.120
I don't know.

22:15.140 --> 22:15.501
I don't know.

22:16.542 --> 22:17.804
It's one of those unexplainable things.

22:17.884 --> 22:25.974
It has to do a lot with the traditions, the reunions and all those other things.

22:26.615 --> 22:28.157
All right, this same kind of question.

22:29.879 --> 22:34.606
What did you learn at A&M that's been important in your life?

22:35.647 --> 22:36.728
I learned how to deal with people.

22:39.212 --> 22:40.193
Going through the Corps,

22:41.219 --> 22:47.866
makes you learn what's important and what's not important.

22:48.427 --> 23:02.641
It makes you learn how to get along with people in adverse situations, which has helped me through my entire life, whether it be in pilot training or survival school or different experiences I came through in the military.

23:04.203 --> 23:05.584
You learn how to handle stress.

23:08.748 --> 23:10.990
You learn how to get along with people.

23:11.645 --> 23:13.467
how to get the most out of people.

23:14.768 --> 23:20.494
I find it invaluable in my job today, the people that work for me, the skills that I learned.

23:23.477 --> 23:31.325
You learn to be, you learn that rank and position isn't that important, it's how you deal with people.

23:33.908 --> 23:34.448
Bottom line.

23:35.610 --> 23:37.011
If you were a consultant,

23:37.767 --> 23:47.618
to advise the A&M leadership today about what they should do for A&M's continuing growth and progress?

23:49.500 --> 23:50.381
Don't let the Corps go away.

23:52.343 --> 23:54.765
Okay, how do you do that?

23:56.367 --> 23:58.249
The thing that makes A&M different is the Corps.

23:59.671 --> 24:04.676
If the Corps goes away, A&M becomes TU on Abrazos.

24:04.696 --> 24:06.458
But how do they keep it from it?

24:07.147 --> 24:15.815
Well, I think, you know, I recruit for the Corps.

24:16.216 --> 24:27.546
I think there are enough young men and women who want to go into the Corps that if they allow them into the school, I think the school needs to make special exception.

24:27.606 --> 24:37.035
I mean, the role, Dr. Bowen had said one time when he was out here that the role of A&M is to produce leaders.

24:38.163 --> 24:42.892
And the core is the epitome of a leadership laboratory.

24:45.297 --> 24:51.911
I think special exceptions need to be made for kids who want to go into the core to make sure that the core stays.

24:51.931 --> 24:59.125
You know, you may not have the highest academic standards or whatever, but academic standards alone are not what's important if you're building leaders.

25:00.235 --> 25:06.181
If you're building geeks, then maybe you just look at academics like the Air Force Academy is doing.

25:06.202 --> 25:08.684
The Air Force Academy has gotten out of the leadership business.

25:08.704 --> 25:10.907
What else other than the Corps?

25:14.571 --> 25:19.516
Don't let 2020 run away with itself.

25:20.657 --> 25:24.762
What do you give up in getting to 2020?

25:24.842 --> 25:29.567
What do you throw away that's made A&M unique?

25:30.526 --> 25:32.529
How large should the institution become?

25:32.549 --> 25:33.751
No larger than it is now.

25:34.331 --> 25:34.472
Okay.

25:34.492 --> 25:35.513
Then how do you select?

25:36.074 --> 25:38.057
Well, you've got to continue doing the same thing you're doing.

25:38.077 --> 25:39.459
You look at students.

25:39.579 --> 25:41.061
You don't look at grades alone.

25:41.121 --> 25:44.966
You look at the cross-section, the total cross-section, what they've done.

25:45.347 --> 25:46.488
You know, have they played sports?

25:46.508 --> 25:47.750
Have they been involved in student government?

25:47.770 --> 25:49.693
Have they volunteered?

25:49.713 --> 25:50.114
Whatever.

25:50.194 --> 25:51.355
You look at the cross-section.

25:51.375 --> 25:55.882
You look at talents that will make them good leaders.

25:57.584 --> 25:58.305
And it's...

25:59.264 --> 26:08.336
You know, there's a tremendous pressure, of course, in the state of Texas to get more people into A&M with the number of people that apply annually.

26:10.018 --> 26:18.690
But if you open it up, you get an Ohio State or you get, you know, you get just this huge, massive humanity and you lose the quality.

26:19.497 --> 26:21.560
There's a lot of good places people can go to school in Texas.

26:22.161 --> 26:25.785
You know, don't ruin A&M to let in anymore.

26:25.805 --> 26:26.586
I wouldn't.

26:26.827 --> 26:29.831
It's about as big probably now as it ought to get.

26:30.071 --> 26:31.032
I wish it were not as big.

26:31.052 --> 26:32.134
I wish it was not as big.

26:33.696 --> 26:37.781
But, you know, we can handle it at this size.

26:37.801 --> 26:39.303
I wouldn't want to see it get any bigger.

26:39.884 --> 26:48.856
But don't let the goals of 2020, the academic goals of 2020 ruin what has made A&M unique.

26:48.876 --> 26:49.437
It is...

26:50.328 --> 26:56.875
You probably don't have academically the smartest people in the world graduating from A&M.

26:57.155 --> 26:59.398
You know, there may be other institutions that are smarter.

27:00.038 --> 27:18.158
But I think the product that A&M produces now, the leadership potential, the human interpersonal skills, everything else, the rural environment, produce a type of person that can go into any environment and succeed with the right kind of values.

27:18.796 --> 27:23.583
I would hate to see us just go for the goals of 2020 and throw that away.

27:23.603 --> 27:25.707
I agree.

27:27.049 --> 27:33.418
If you could make a major gift to A&M, somebody hands you a million dollar check... I'd give it to the Corps.

27:34.320 --> 27:35.702
And what would you have them do with it?

27:36.223 --> 27:37.705
I'd have them set up scholarships.

27:39.948 --> 27:43.133
One of the things I think that needs to happen for the Corps

27:43.568 --> 28:11.989
is one of the things i'm disappointed with in the corps is that we have to admit a lot of people right now that probably shouldn't be in the corps i look at kids that are obviously overweight i looked at you know some other things like that that this is a military type environment it's not the military it's a military type environment that they probably shouldn't be there i would love to see it where the corps had enough money to offer scholarships to the right kind of kids and bring them in where where maybe the corps could be self-endowing and pay

28:12.577 --> 28:19.204
for the school, that would take a lot more than a million dollars.

28:20.065 --> 28:29.054
And for us out here, one of the things that's a critical thing for us, the kids in the Corps get the Soros normally the freshman, sophomore year.

28:29.515 --> 28:40.026
The problem for us in New Mexico is that you get a kid coming up on a junior year who's gonna go DNC, like Tony Camilli, who was commander of E1.

28:40.586 --> 28:42.128
Outstanding young man.

28:42.783 --> 28:48.549
But then he's got full out of state tuition for his junior and senior year.

28:48.669 --> 28:51.191
It's a big deal to us out of state.

28:52.773 --> 28:54.835
We've got Tony Camilli who was there.

28:54.875 --> 28:56.837
We've got Ben Abruzzo who was commander of N1.

28:57.978 --> 29:03.163
We've got a bunch of kids there now in the Corps, not all of whom are going in the military.

29:03.664 --> 29:07.828
I just sent in 75 names.

29:08.753 --> 29:13.099
last month of kids who are interested in going to A&M and being in the Corps.

29:13.119 --> 29:13.820
Hey, that's great.

29:14.962 --> 29:20.750
We do a really good job here in Albuquerque in the New Mexico area of finding kids.

29:21.030 --> 29:28.881
But these are 75 kids that want to go to A&M, almost all of them, good academic standing, good background, good extracurricular activities.

29:29.722 --> 29:31.825
Not all are going to go in the military, but they want to be in the Corps.

29:32.378 --> 29:41.372
And you have to talk to the parents and say, well, we can help you out your freshman, sophomore year, but your junior and senior year, you're going to be paying full ride unless you can get a scholarship to some other place.

29:42.053 --> 29:56.255
For us out of state, it would be great if there was a follow-on Saul Ross for those kids because it is a, I mean, a $1,000 annual scholarship is worth $8,000 or $7,000 to these kids here.

29:57.057 --> 30:00.462
And we've got some great kids from here who are going to A&M.

30:01.606 --> 30:05.872
So anyway, that's what I would probably do is put in a scholarship fund for out-of-state kids.

30:07.094 --> 30:07.294
All right.

30:07.454 --> 30:15.146
To what former students or faculty or advisors do you feel most grateful for what they meant to you?

30:16.227 --> 30:17.108
What individuals?

30:17.689 --> 30:30.668
Dr. Rodenberger, for one, for the help he gave me in mentoring me my senior year and then being my advisor when I was getting my master's.

30:32.707 --> 30:39.915
I'm just trying to think of some of the process and the Aero Department who I had most contact with.

30:41.496 --> 30:43.739
Mr. Lowy.

30:50.826 --> 30:52.328
That's about it.

30:52.968 --> 30:53.789
What have we left out?

30:54.590 --> 30:55.311
I'm trying to think.

30:56.692 --> 31:00.216
Did I have some other stuff I was going to talk about?

31:04.297 --> 31:10.371
Oh, one of the other, just a story, you know, that they don't do that anymore, but we used to steal Seale's footlockers.

31:11.353 --> 31:12.035
Oh, yeah, yeah.

31:12.055 --> 31:13.678
You know, our freshman year.

31:13.699 --> 31:14.761
All right, now how did you get it?

31:15.082 --> 31:16.425
How did you get it out of his room?

31:16.485 --> 31:18.890
We stole a passkey, or we got a passkey.

31:18.910 --> 31:21.095
Of course, the big thing in those days was to get a passkey.

31:21.196 --> 31:22.238
We got a passkey.
