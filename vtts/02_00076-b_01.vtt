WEBVTT

00:01.988 --> 00:07.536
Austin, picking up where we left off in the 
interview with Davis Ford. And let's start by your

00:08.917 --> 00:12.923
describing. One this morning, you don't have to 
hear this one, you'll get it when they record it.

00:17.709 --> 00:18.951
From Holtz, is that his name? Yeah. Yeah. He's 
going to record it. I gave her the ring and she gave

00:22.216 --> 00:26.241
me the finger. Yeah. Of course, circa 55 to 59 was my 
era there, and I was from West Texas, so I obviously

00:28.297 --> 00:43.458
couldn't go back to Lubbock very frequently, so my 
roommates and my Aggie colleagues and I would come

00:28.297 --> 00:43.458
primarily to Austin, Dallas, and Houston to have 
our social life. Of those three, I must admit that

00:43.738 --> 00:46.462
Austin was our favorite. It seems like that the 
University of Texas coeds kind of got tired of the

00:46.482 --> 00:54.253
attorney boys, and the Aggies were kind of a breath 
of fresh air, so my roommate and dear friends at

00:54.487 --> 01:01.297
that time, and I had girlfriends in Austin, so we 
would make the trek here, this was my junior and

00:54.487 --> 01:01.297
senior year when we had more freedom, make the trek 
on a regular basis. Virtually every weekend we

01:01.317 --> 01:02.740
were in Austin. And what, Carlota? No, just two of 
us on that particular occasion, because we had

01:04.623 --> 01:09.190
girlfriends who also were friends with each 
other, so it was just a real night. It made, after

01:09.290 --> 01:16.801
two years of kind of social isolation, we all of a 
sudden really started enjoying the fruition of

01:09.290 --> 01:16.801
social life in college our junior and senior year. 
Right, but now back in Brown College Station, if

01:16.821 --> 01:18.604
you and Some of your friends want to just go off 
campus and have a good time. Where'd y'all go?

01:21.192 --> 01:23.156
Well, uh, the clay pits, obviously. It's a 
swimming hole. And what'd y'all do at the clay

01:24.798 --> 01:26.741
pits? Well, we just used to go out there, and, uh, of 
course, I was, uh, a little serious, too, because I

01:26.761 --> 01:38.079
didn't drink much beer, but my colleagues would go 
out there and drink beer and jump in the water. Uh,

01:38.099 --> 01:39.021
sometimes with girlfriends, sometimes not. That 
was, that was my version. Uh, Brian and Charlie's

01:39.662 --> 01:41.024
station were going to stay out at that time. Uh, and 
this really wasn't too much to do. I'd go down to

01:41.905 --> 01:43.007
Brian's and say, put this out right now. He came in, 
let it go just a little. This is a second start on the

01:45.955 --> 01:49.360
18th of September. Austin with Davis Ford. 
Disregard everything on this tape prior to this

01:51.844 --> 01:56.831
point because it will sound amusing.

01:59.275 --> 02:13.937
We began this morning, and I was asking you to 
describe the community of College Station when

01:59.275 --> 02:13.937
you were a student and what you and your fellow 
Aggies in the 50s What did you all do for fun? Where

02:15.685 --> 02:16.386
did you go? Not too much to do in College Station or 
Bryan. As I mentioned previously, the clay pits

02:19.869 --> 02:25.155
were kind of the place to hang out. Just old sand 
borough area and had some water in it. So we'd go out

02:30.801 --> 02:34.205
there and swim and drink a little beer. And that was 
one place. Other than that, it was pretty mundane.

02:38.570 --> 02:43.215
There were no particular places that we enjoyed 
going there that I can recall an immediate area.

02:45.676 --> 02:50.524
Now you mentioned earlier about coming to Austin, 
you and some other friends.

02:53.289 --> 02:54.291
Was that typical? Were there a number of students 
who went? I think that the points of light around

02:56.695 --> 03:05.650
where we'd spend our weekends would be Austin, 
Dallas, Houston, those three places, at least the

02:56.695 --> 03:05.650
crowds that I ran in. And I think of those three, my 
favorite was certainly Austin. My roommate and I,

03:11.815 --> 03:18.645
my junior and senior year, were dating University 
of Texas girls, and Austin was a fun place to come,

03:11.815 --> 03:18.645
and that was our favorite habitat. Now, other of my 
colleagues, we might go to Dallas or Houston or

03:18.705 --> 03:30.483
maybe Denton, but my favorite place, including a 
lot of my good friends, was to come down here to

03:18.705 --> 03:30.483
Austin. On Austin, on a weekend, if you and a date 
went out, Did anybody tease an Aggie or make fun of

03:35.305 --> 03:39.491
an Aggie here in Austin? Oh yeah, sure. Was it good 
nature? Oh, it was good nature. I had some good

03:42.756 --> 04:01.245
personal friends who were at UT and we ragged each 
other pretty hard, but it was, they were mostly

03:42.756 --> 04:01.245
fraternity guys, but now when I was a freshman we 
were kind of looked down upon because we were young

03:42.756 --> 04:01.245
looking and had shaved heads, but when we got to 
become junior and seniors we were obviously more

03:42.756 --> 04:01.245
sophisticated in the world and I think innately we 
considered ourselves to be a little superior to

04:01.580 --> 04:07.847
the fraternity boys, but it was all good fun. When 
you came over here, did you wear uniforms? No, no. I

04:13.973 --> 04:17.497
assumed that you didn't wear a uniform. As I 
recall, Haskell, the regs at that time and the

04:17.998 --> 04:28.549
corps, you could take a uniform off once you were 15 
miles outside of town or something like that,

04:17.998 --> 04:28.549
outside of Bryant College Station, off the 
campus. So we'd leave in our uniforms and then

04:28.985 --> 04:35.512
immediately change to civilian clothes once we 
got to that limit. Now, was it common to have a car

04:35.932 --> 04:39.556
then? Very uncommon. I didn't have a car in my 
senior year. So you doubled up with somebody who

04:42.799 --> 04:47.684
had a car, or you hitchhiked? That's right. Now, my 
freshman and sophomore year, I'd come to Austin

04:48.244 --> 04:54.130
quite a bit, and I'd put my uniform on because it was 
so easy to get a ride. So I would hitchhike a lot my

04:54.290 --> 04:56.072
freshman year. Not so much my sophomore and junior 
years. I always had a friend who had a car, and then I

04:59.052 --> 05:01.715
had a car my senior year. If you were going to 
hitchhike from the campus to Austin, where did you

05:02.155 --> 05:07.121
go to start that? Right across the railroad by the 
vet school, where we normally start. And was it

05:14.068 --> 05:16.091
common to get a ride all the way? Oh, yeah. It was 
easy. It was real easy. Did you hold up a sign or

05:18.694 --> 05:20.075
anything? No. Or just your thumb? Just your thumb. 
Sometimes you might go to Bastrop and change cars

05:22.951 --> 05:26.275
and get on into Austin. It was never a problem back 
in 55, 56. Did you or anybody else you know of ever

05:29.399 --> 05:34.807
have an unfortunate incident hitchhiking? Very 
unusual. Back in those days, it was a safe thing to

05:36.068 --> 05:38.091
do. Now, the hitchhiker probably has as much to 
fear as the one who picks up the hitchhiker. But I

05:43.478 --> 05:45.841
don't recall of any incident. It was so common, it 
was just... It was a nice way to do it. All right,

05:49.695 --> 05:55.203
now, so when you're leaving Austin to go back to 
College Station, where did you catch the ride? Out

05:55.584 --> 05:57.808
on 290, right outside of Austin. My grandparents 
lived here, and they'd take me out to 290, and I'd be

05:57.948 --> 06:01.694
out there. No time at all, you'd get a ride. Let's 
see, was there bus service in Bryan College

06:04.733 --> 06:09.939
Station then? You know, even then, from Austin, it 
was very, you had to go to Waco and change or

06:09.979 --> 06:14.966
something. There was not a way to go. But then in 
town, was there a municipal bus? Could you ride

06:18.530 --> 06:19.451
that? Oh, sure. And where did you catch that bus? 
Well, they had a center location in town that kind

06:22.195 --> 06:29.003
of had a radial effect in all parts of Austin. No, 
no, no, in Bryan College Station. Oh, in Bryan

06:31.523 --> 06:32.484
College Station? Was there a municipal bus then? 
Oh, no, no, none. I'm sorry, we're just talking

06:35.428 --> 06:36.970
about Austin. None whatsoever that I recall in 
Bryan College Station. Let's see, and let's

06:40.494 --> 06:49.406
recapture your thoughts about Lupo and Pinky as 
people and what their role was in the life of the

06:40.494 --> 06:49.406
campus. You were asking me about the real visible 
characters that we had on campus back in those

06:50.107 --> 06:57.336
days, and I recited that my freshman year, Bear 
Bryant was a coach in 1955 that I remember pinky

06:57.637 --> 07:04.006
downs leading the yells at the Grove. I believe 
that he passed away shortly thereafter, probably

07:05.308 --> 07:10.055
during my tenure at A&M. I don't remember the exact 
date, but he was certainly a legend. And the second

07:13.801 --> 07:18.027
was Lupo. We're getting ready to talk about Lupo 
and other characters. He, I remember... When I

07:25.430 --> 07:32.499
first came on the campus in 1955, Lupo had a very 
prominent place there right next to the campus.

07:32.579 --> 07:34.842
And he was advertised 50% off. And of course, we 
never believed any of that. But I think Lupo was one

07:37.746 --> 07:44.875
of the few marketing people I've ever seen, 
retailers, that actually gave you 50% off,

07:37.746 --> 07:44.875
because we'd compare prices. And he always seemed 
to be the lowest. But he was very philanthropic. He

07:47.919 --> 07:49.281
helped out freshmen. He was just a great man. And I 
tracked him all the way through past graduation. I

07:54.388 --> 07:57.131
think he finally passed away just, what, five or 
ten years ago. So he was quite an institution. He

07:59.294 --> 08:02.177
was a very unselfish person. And he was good 
friends with Tiger Teague and Earl Rudder, so that

08:02.197 --> 08:05.941
kind of helped him. Pinky? No, Lupo. No, no, no. 
Describe Pinky. Oh, Pinky? What you saw of him.

08:12.288 --> 08:18.235
Well, he's a little bitty guy, and his suits always 
seemed too big for him. I don't really know much

08:18.991 --> 08:20.553
about his history. I'd read about him in a book that 
was written on Texas A&M, I believe back in 1950 or

08:20.593 --> 08:25.919
51. But where did you see him and how did you 
encounter him? Yeah, well he'd be around the

08:30.605 --> 08:35.531
campus, but also I'd see him at Yale practice back 
in 55, 56. And Bear Bryant, describe him during

08:35.951 --> 08:39.315
your years. You know, Bear Bryant is kind of 
interesting. I went to school with, and still good

08:41.578 --> 08:45.302
friends with him, Charlie Milstead, Told me a lot 
of Bear Bryant stories. Also, my wife was from

08:47.174 --> 08:51.758
Bryant and used to date some of the Bear Bryant 
football players. So I got a lot of stories about

08:51.778 --> 08:53.140
him. I'd see him from time to time around the MSC. At 
that time, we thought he was old, mean-looking,

08:56.543 --> 09:00.728
but at that time he was in his 40s. Sometimes you 
realize or forget how young he was when he was

09:01.669 --> 09:05.132
coaching in him. But the players were absolutely 
in awe of him. He had a certain personality that

09:08.796 --> 09:14.462
would evidently intimidate people who played for 
him. Milstead used to tell me that he'd be walking

09:16.698 --> 09:25.568
along the campus and see Barry Bryant walking on 
the sidewalk and he'd go around make a detour two or

09:16.698 --> 09:25.568
three blocks just from saying just to keep him 
saying hello to him. He had that kind of

09:25.708 --> 09:27.009
personality.

09:30.133 --> 09:38.442
Let's see were there any world events or national 
events that occurred while you were an

09:30.133 --> 09:38.442
undergraduate that had an effect upon what you 
thought your life was going to be? Very few. I was

09:43.989 --> 09:56.586
active in SCONA, Student Council on National 
Affairs, or Student Conference on National

09:43.989 --> 09:56.586
Affairs, which I believe was started by an Aggie 
back about 1955 or 56, and I was active in that. I

09:56.606 --> 09:59.691
remember John Hagler was active in it and a lot of my 
colleagues. I would go pick up delegates at the

10:00.932 --> 10:04.297
train station in North Zulch. Trains quit coming 
to College Station, and so... The highlight I

10:08.105 --> 10:12.810
remember in terms of a national figure was Hubert 
Humphrey spoke there one time. I don't recall

10:12.830 --> 10:18.696
anybody else of national or international note 
during my four years at A&M. It's kind of an

10:18.716 --> 10:19.878
anecdote. I remember going down to the Bush 
Library opening just a few months ago. I guess

10:26.425 --> 10:29.528
what, 1998. And seeing all these world figures 
like Valesa, John Major, on and on and on all the

10:36.387 --> 11:01.770
living presidents except president reagan all 
the living first ladies and i told some of the cadet

10:36.387 --> 11:01.770
seniors how fortunate they were to be at a m such a 
monumental event regardless of your politics a

10:36.387 --> 11:01.770
presidential library is really something big 
we'll all remember that day but i was just kind of

10:36.387 --> 11:01.770
jokingly told one of the cadet seniors who i think a 
ross volunteer who was right in the middle of all

10:36.387 --> 11:01.770
this i said i hope you appreciate the national and 
international figures you have when you're on the

11:02.341 --> 11:04.983
campus. When I was at A&M, all we had was one drunk 
ex-county commissioner, and that was a highlight

11:05.023 --> 11:10.188
of my career. We all kind of laughed at that, but it 
was a cataclysmic event. And presidential

11:13.631 --> 11:30.105
libraries, of course, living here in Austin and 
being active with the LBJ Library here and now the

11:13.631 --> 11:30.105
Bush Library, it just attracts scholars and 
historians, and it's a wonderful advantage for

11:13.631 --> 11:30.105
any university to have that affiliation with a 
presidential library. It's beyond description.

11:31.754 --> 11:32.715
Court trips. Where did y'all go on court trips and 
describe what they were like for a student? Court

11:37.943 --> 11:41.669
trips were strictly limited to three cities in my 
tenure there. Fort Worth, Dallas, and, I'm sorry,

11:41.729 --> 11:43.952
four. Fort Worth, Dallas, Houston, and Austin. 
And we would alternate. So it would be Fort Worth,

11:47.578 --> 11:54.969
I'd be at Fort Worth and Austin one year and then 
Dallas and Houston the next year and then rotate

11:47.578 --> 11:54.969
back. They were great events. We always had 
Friends who lived in one of those four towns would

11:58.940 --> 12:01.943
stay with them. And depending on what class you 
were, it depends how far you had to shine your shoes

12:02.043 --> 12:07.209
and all that. But they were highlights. They were 
really great times. Normally you'd leave College

12:09.932 --> 12:12.614
Station when? Friday. Come back Sunday. Friday 
afternoon? Friday afternoon. Go do whatever

12:17.219 --> 12:20.302
partying we were going to do that night in 
respective towns. Do our thing. Go see the

12:21.984 --> 12:23.085
football game. Come back Sunday. Somewhat 
bedraggled. And then have to start studying again

12:25.348 --> 12:27.630
Sunday night. Now, let's see, in Austin it was 
Congress Avenue. Congress Avenue. Houston.

12:34.101 --> 12:35.923
Houston, it was downtown Houston. I don't 
remember if it was Travis. It wasn't Main Street?

12:38.847 --> 12:40.529
Maybe it was Main or Travis, one of those two. Fort 
Worth, I don't remember. I think it was Main Street

12:43.593 --> 12:44.854
and Fort Worth. And Dallas, Elmer, Maine. And 
Dallas was Elmer, Maine. Right. Do you remember

12:51.893 --> 12:58.803
any particular event of any court trip that was 
special to you, plus good or bad? Saw a lot of good

12:58.883 --> 13:00.686
football players. I remember Don Meredith was 
playing for SMU at the time.

13:07.696 --> 13:11.341
Texas was starting to rebuild. Rice was always a 
good team. I know they upset us. My senior year, the

13:18.091 --> 13:19.853
court trip, upset us. We were number one in the 
nation at the time, I believe. My junior years

13:22.673 --> 13:32.029
when, I guess, no, I'm sorry, my freshman year at 
Rice was when we came back and made a 21-point

13:22.673 --> 13:32.029
advantage in the last eight or nine minutes and won 
the game. But SMU, TCU, Rice were all powers at that

13:32.049 --> 13:36.838
time. So it was a big game. Probably drew as many 
people then or more than we do today. Now,

13:42.407 --> 13:44.631
normally, did you all have dates? On court trip 
weekends? Depends what your classification was.

13:47.230 --> 13:50.794
As a freshman, it was not a freshman privilege to 
have a date, being facetious. Very few of us had

13:50.834 --> 13:54.998
dates because women just didn't want to go with 
skinhead people. But that changed our sophomore,

13:55.018 --> 13:58.101
junior, and senior years. We always had dates. Now 
were the Friday and Saturday night activities,

13:59.662 --> 14:05.808
were they of a positive nature? By and large. The 
parties and things like that? Yeah. There was

14:11.614 --> 14:14.837
excesses, but not to the point that you'd really 
get in trouble. All right, now let's go to a home

14:15.290 --> 14:19.195
football weekend. Make believe that I know 
nothing about what that was like. Describe for me

14:22.680 --> 14:28.308
what went on on campus the whole weekend of a home 
game. The routine was fixed. The times and the

14:30.330 --> 14:32.714
dates and the fringe had changed. But the routine 
was fixed. And that is, Friday night, you would

14:33.655 --> 14:37.240
have a midnight yoke practice. Saturday, you'd 
spend your time getting ready for the march in, and

14:38.121 --> 14:42.467
then the march in, and then the game. And then 
Saturday night, you'd have individual parties.

14:45.125 --> 14:52.496
Sometimes you would have a senior ring dance or a 
sophomore ball or a freshman ball coincident with

14:45.125 --> 14:52.496
a home football game. But the routine was pretty 
well fixed, but it was always a lot of fun. Now,

14:56.221 --> 14:59.306
where was Yale practices held in those days? Yale 
practices were normally at the Grove. At the

15:02.290 --> 15:02.831
Grove. Yeah, it was not at the football stadium. 
And was everything on the ground? Did anybody get

15:07.337 --> 15:11.063
up in any kind of bleacher or riser or anything? No, 
the coach. Normally the football players would

15:12.625 --> 15:14.187
not. talk it was the head Yale leader and the coach. 
That'd be about the only people that would see it at

15:17.769 --> 15:21.915
the Yale practice but it was integral. Right and 
what all what all happened? Well it was just the

15:26.000 --> 15:32.529
Yale leaders kind of took control of it and the 
coach would come up depending who it was. Bear

15:32.830 --> 15:35.293
Bryant was always pretty good at that at that deal. 
I think Jim Myers was there. My last two years, he

15:38.855 --> 15:42.000
was pretty effective. He was more effective at 
Yale practice than he was the next day. It was

15:44.424 --> 15:48.430
pretty good, too. Go through all the Yales in 
spirit. Final review. Talk about final review for

15:55.360 --> 15:57.303
you. Final review, it's kind of interesting 
because it was a very big transition. My final

16:02.251 --> 16:04.054
review was rained out. I'll never forget that. So 
after graduation, it was pouring down rain, so I

16:06.192 --> 16:17.831
didn't get to go through with my new lieutenant 
bars and final review, but certainly the other

16:06.192 --> 16:17.831
three years we did. All right. So in your case, 
where were those bars pinned on? On the collar. No,

16:23.139 --> 16:23.860
no, no, no. Who pinned them on? Yeah. It depends. 
You know, it depends. In my case, it depends on the

16:28.805 --> 16:31.089
individual. It could have been your mother or your 
girlfriend or your ex-wife or ex-girlfriend. But

16:34.434 --> 16:38.601
in my case, it was my future wife at Pindamon, who I 
was dating at the time. And so where did that

16:38.621 --> 16:40.724
happen? In this case, it was normally on the drill 
field. But in this case, it was in G. Raleigh White.

16:46.714 --> 16:47.796
Right after commencement? After commencement 
and after the commissioning ceremony. And

16:50.740 --> 16:54.306
commencement was held when? Well, there was a 
commissioning ceremony, which I believe was

16:55.265 --> 17:00.550
after commencement at that time. It was held in G. 
Raleigh, and at that time we had about 7,000

17:01.991 --> 17:10.478
students on the campus, so we had easy 
accommodations for that. I think there was just

17:10.839 --> 17:12.060
one graduation. I think that's correct. Describe 
commencement then. You know, I don't remember

17:21.488 --> 17:24.371
commencement too much about it. It's kind of 
Interesting, I heard a politician one time, when I

17:25.133 --> 17:40.196
was in the Association of Former Students, give a 
commencement address, and he said, he was talking

17:25.133 --> 17:40.196
to all the parents, he said, you probably don't 
remember any commencement address you've ever

17:25.133 --> 17:40.196
heard, and this will be consistent with that. For 
some reason, you just don't remember

17:40.837 --> 17:43.440
commencement addresses.

17:46.205 --> 17:49.429
The only one I guess I remember was one of my nephews 
graduating from Dartmouth. And the commencement

17:51.032 --> 17:52.474
address, was very good, and I guess I was more 
receptive as an adult than I was as a graduating

17:53.348 --> 17:59.436
senior. Did you have family there who all was at 
commencement? Family was always at

18:03.781 --> 18:06.684
commencement, all my family and my grandfather 
and grandmother.

18:10.309 --> 18:11.030
Silver Taps. Make believe that I'm not an Aggie. 
Tell me what Saps is and what it meant to you.

18:17.197 --> 18:19.280
Fortunately, we didn't have too many of them when I 
was in school. That's when the Ross Volunteers

18:24.938 --> 18:31.648
It gives a salute to those who have been, who have 
deceased. Normally happened at night. It was on

18:34.673 --> 18:35.534
the campus. I was a member of the firing squad in 
Ross Volunteers my junior year. So I participated

18:40.462 --> 18:43.586
just as a member of the Ross Volunteers. Tell me 
what that. Ross Volunteers is a. No, no, the firing

18:46.331 --> 18:47.412
squad. Tell me what that meant. Well, it was kind of 
a salute, a military salute. Taps was played. And

18:54.976 --> 19:03.972
you would have three platoons of the Ross 
Volunteers, and we would fire those fire blanks,

18:54.976 --> 19:03.972
and it would be three volleys. I think it was, as I 
recall, it was three volleys of seven rifles each,

19:05.274 --> 19:13.829
so it would be 21 shots fired. And you all would 
gather where? Out in front of the old main. But did

19:19.006 --> 19:20.868
y'all march over there? We would march over there 
as Ross Volunteers. Now, the student body would

19:22.570 --> 19:25.493
just walk over there. Yeah, yeah. But y'all 
marched. We would march. We would form up in front

19:27.335 --> 19:30.078
of one of the arms and march over there. Three 
platoons of seven each. In our Ross Volunteers. In

19:32.460 --> 19:34.062
your RVs. And did y'all take that, was that a 
serious event? Very serious. When the civil taps

19:41.830 --> 19:45.414
was over, what happened? You just quietly go back 
to your rooms. It was very quiet. Everything just,

19:48.790 --> 19:52.535
it was quiet and you just go back to your rooms. Do 
you remember ever anybody trying to act silly

19:52.555 --> 19:58.684
after a... No, no. And what if I had, what if you or 
somebody else had a real big test the next day and

20:00.327 --> 20:10.682
you really had to study some more that night? Did 
anybody ever do that? Yeah, you would go back...

20:14.626 --> 20:24.315
The protocol was basically you go back and go to bed 
because it's pretty late, but it was not unheard of

20:14.626 --> 20:24.315
to go ahead and turn the light on and study after 
silver taps. I think that was just kind of the

20:24.916 --> 20:26.757
practical reality of it. What were the no-no's 
after silver taps? Well, first the no-no was not to

20:31.041 --> 20:32.523
go.

20:37.868 --> 20:42.732
There was just no hell raising or anything, just a 
very quiet, somber kind of thing. You go back and

20:43.904 --> 20:50.151
Now, there might have been a light restriction, 
which you could pull your shutters down or

20:43.904 --> 20:50.151
something like that and study. I don't recall any 
prohibition on that. All right. Then Muster.

20:55.356 --> 20:56.598
Muster, of course, once a year. Held where? San 
Jacinto Day, 21st of April. Held where? Muster was

21:00.802 --> 21:05.267
held out in front of MSC, Memorial Student Center, 
when I was there. I think that letter changed over

21:06.448 --> 21:08.591
to G. Wally White. It would go to G. Wally White, I 
believe, if it was raining, but I don't recall any.

21:12.355 --> 21:12.595
It was. When I was there, muster was always held on 
the campus out in front on the lawn of the Memorial

21:13.132 --> 21:18.117
Student Center. And about what time of day? As I 
recall, it was in the afternoon. Or it was the

21:22.621 --> 21:24.222
daytime. It was not evening ceremony. And did that 
seem to you to be an important tradition event? Oh,

21:28.987 --> 21:30.288
certainly. Certainly. Yeah, we were fully 
indoctrinated and inculcated on muster from the

21:31.189 --> 21:36.414
time we hit the campus. All right. As you were 
preparing, approaching graduation, What sort of

21:44.013 --> 21:46.275
world did you think you were entering? Kind of 
interesting. We had a big advantage then, and then

21:48.838 --> 21:55.426
our futures for the next two years, six months to 
two years, were already prescribed. That is, we

21:55.446 --> 21:56.707
had to go to the military. Military was obligatory 
at that time for all men. And so we had, of course,

22:03.174 --> 22:07.599
had our contracts, and then we had our 
commissions. So we would go in at different times.

22:10.642 --> 22:13.125
The beauty of that is that it was a perfect 
transition. certainly in a time of peace like we

22:13.595 --> 22:16.179
were in at that time. Perfect transition from 
college life to professional life. Gave you time

22:19.664 --> 22:31.101
to see different parts of the world, to mature out, 
to make new friends, to get integrated into men

22:19.664 --> 22:31.101
from other universities, different parts of the 
country. Most Aggies were pretty provincial when

22:31.782 --> 22:36.308
we left A&M after our senior year, weren't world 
travel. And this was a great maturing time, and it

22:37.009 --> 22:43.078
was for me. Just had the time of my life when I was in 
service. How well prepared did you think you were

22:46.746 --> 22:53.272
for whatever future life there was? I had no 
yardstick. I felt like, you know, when you're a

22:54.433 --> 23:00.918
senior and you go through the Corps for four years 
and you get out with an engineering degree, I felt

22:54.433 --> 23:00.918
like I was prepared for anything. But there was 
probably a tad of insecurity there when you get

23:01.018 --> 23:04.101
right down to it. You've been in universities, so 
you understand that. But when I got in the service

23:09.366 --> 23:13.369
and I was integrated into people from MIT and 
Lafayette and New York City College and some of the

23:13.670 --> 23:28.564
Ivy League schools, I felt even more prepared 
because I felt like we were probably matured out

23:13.670 --> 23:28.564
and had as good an education and felt better than a 
lot of my colleagues from other universities. I

23:28.844 --> 23:29.605
really felt that way. Why did you major in 
engineering? Interesting story. I'll make a long

23:35.210 --> 23:36.451
story short. My dad was a farmer.

23:40.415 --> 23:43.558
I come from about three generations of 
agriculture up in Panhandle, Texas. And if you

23:44.129 --> 23:48.053
remember the 1950s, the cattle market broke and 
went through a severe drought. And I saw my dad

23:48.073 --> 23:50.175
slowly go broke. My good friend at that time in high 
school, his father was a consulting engineer. So I

23:58.683 --> 24:00.645
just thought that was kind of a neat thing to do. I 
had no idea what engineers did. I didn't have the

24:02.427 --> 24:03.868
slightest idea. So I went to him and

24:03.888 --> 24:13.157
said, Mr. Hazy, his name was H-A-S-I-E, Mr. Hazy, 
I-A-L. I think I want to be a consulting engineer.

24:15.587 --> 24:16.409
Tell me what to do. He said, I'll tell you what to do. 
He said, you go to Texas A&M and get a civil

24:21.376 --> 24:24.321
engineering degree. Then you go to the service and 
get that behind you. And then come back to Fort

24:28.327 --> 24:33.555
Worth and work for the Corps of Engineers and go 
through the training program. You're going to

24:33.615 --> 24:37.180
learn a lot about building dams and roads and 
surveying and all of that. And then finish our

24:38.482 --> 24:41.507
training program and come to work for me at 
Lubbock. and come up through the ranks of my

24:42.314 --> 24:45.998
consulting firm, which seemed like a great career 
path. So he was my first mentor, and I did 100% of

24:46.018 --> 24:51.204
that. Went to E&M, got my civil engineering 
degree, went to the service, got that out of the

24:51.224 --> 25:03.198
way, went to the Corps of Engineers in Fort Worth, 
and got a great training program there, went to

24:51.224 --> 25:03.198
work for him, then he passed away. So that 
disrupted my timetable, and that's what sent me

25:03.279 --> 25:07.984
back to graduate school. But he was my first 
mentor, and that's kind of how I got in, made the

25:08.251 --> 25:17.581
transition first in my family, since, or last, to 
get out of agriculture and into a technical field.

25:17.781 --> 25:22.045
Who were the people at A&M that helped shape your 
life there? I may have addressed some of that

25:22.386 --> 25:27.491
before in my earlier tape, but certainly I had some 
great mentors. Doc Harrington was my hydraulics

25:27.511 --> 25:30.654
professor who revered. He was just great. A fellow 
named Dr. Nederman was my reinforced concrete.

25:35.403 --> 25:37.646
Professor, he was... That's Wendell Nederman. 
Wendell Nederman, outstanding, one of the best

25:37.666 --> 25:40.290
professors I ever had. Certainly Spencer 
Buchanan, soil mechanics. Those are the three

25:43.194 --> 25:47.240
that I really revered. And, of course, in graduate 
school, I had even more mentors. Graduate school

25:51.666 --> 25:52.848
is a little bit different. In the College of 
Engineering, I had some just absolutely

25:53.709 --> 25:59.537
marvelous professors here at the University of 
Texas in the 60s. So the foundation I had from those

26:00.327 --> 26:11.082
three gentlemen that I just mentioned, plus two 
professors in particular here at Texas, gave me

26:00.327 --> 26:11.082
opportunities I would never have had had I not met 
them. Were there some NM advisor, counselor, role

26:11.363 --> 26:20.676
model people other than faculty who were 
important to your future? MSC, core, anything

26:21.838 --> 26:24.461
like that? Not really. The only one was the 
director of MSC at that time. I think I may have

26:29.058 --> 26:31.822
mentioned him too, Wayne Stark. Talk about him. 
Wayne Stark was probably the only non-professor

26:32.904 --> 26:41.278
mentor that I had, and I didn't flange in quite as 
much with Wayne. He knew my older brother who had

26:41.298 --> 26:43.261
gone to A&M. He knew my family, so he made it a point 
to know me, as he did many students on the campus.

26:49.250 --> 26:53.537
But I think he was probably more involved in 
perpetuating students to go to Harvard Business

26:54.901 --> 26:59.947
School who were in the business side of it, and not 
necessarily just engineers. But he was a

27:00.708 --> 27:03.392
one-in-a-million kind of guy. He built up the MSC. 
He was a Mackville thinker, a deep thinker, and had

27:04.933 --> 27:11.021
files on every student in the world. I'd go to him, 
even when I became president of the Association of

27:11.081 --> 27:19.972
Former Students, I'd go to Wayne and ask about some 
student or former student, and he'd have a file on

27:11.081 --> 27:19.972
them. He had copious files on his people that he 
helped. Describe the Aggie bonfire in your

27:25.225 --> 27:28.349
student days. It was controversial, believe it or 
not. A lot of the professors who had come to A&M from

27:31.052 --> 27:41.805
other universities thought it was a waste of time 
and encroached on study time, but of course that

27:31.052 --> 27:41.805
was not negotiable. We had one week for bonfire. 
Everybody had to work on just bonfire week. We

27:47.513 --> 27:48.634
started one week before. Everything we could do 
was done in one week. It always rained. We had

27:52.900 --> 27:55.083
cutting areas. It was great camaraderie. We tried 
to get a little studying done during that week, but

27:56.945 --> 28:00.950
it was very difficult to do. But Bonfire Week 
was... Where was it built? It was built, I believe,

28:06.838 --> 28:11.925
all four years when I was at A&M. It was built to 
where it continued to be built for many, many years

28:12.005 --> 28:20.055
thereafter, and that's behind Duncan Meshall 
over by what's now the A&M Press. So that was our, it

28:20.423 --> 28:25.668
used to be, before I got to A&M, I know it was on the 
drill field, but then they moved it. And what was in

28:25.688 --> 28:28.050
the bonfire? What was it that was burned up? What 
was it made of? It was made of logs, mostly

28:30.553 --> 28:33.796
hardwood. I guess all hardwood from Prattis 
Bottoms. Farmers out there would be glad to have

28:36.598 --> 28:40.402
you come out and clear some of their land. It was no 
value with the timber on it. But no trash? Oh, no.

28:44.846 --> 28:46.588
No, that went out many years ago. I think it was 
strictly a log bonfire. I can remember certainly

28:49.533 --> 28:51.478
since the 40s probably. And what was always on top 
of it? The outhouse, of course, and an Austin City

28:54.104 --> 28:59.978
Limits sign. And where did the outhouse come from?

29:05.792 --> 29:07.035
You know, I'm not sure I can answer that. Various 
places. I think they would construct them or they

29:08.567 --> 29:10.829
would steal it or whatever. It was normally stolen 
from some place. I've often wondered sometimes

29:13.432 --> 29:17.236
was it just made just for that purpose? Probably 
was. I don't have a recollection of that. If they

29:19.339 --> 29:20.600
could find one, they'd steal it. If not, they'd 
just make one. But the one thing they would steal in

29:22.642 --> 29:27.507
violation of state law was the City of Austin City 
Limits sign. I have to admit, I think as my junior

29:27.527 --> 29:35.436
year, I helped perpetuate that crime. I think at 
some point after I got out of school, they caught

29:36.040 --> 29:41.870
some kids doing that. Again, you're stealing from 
the state, so it's a fun thing to do, but it's

29:42.050 --> 29:47.339
certainly illegal. Now, during your days, did 
anybody kidnap a mascot from another school?

29:55.075 --> 29:57.137
I don't believe that happened. It was very common. 
Actually, after I left, it was probably more

29:58.638 --> 30:02.122
common, and before I got there, it was common. When 
I was there, I don't recall that ever happening.

30:04.264 --> 30:07.126
Because it has happened and then not happened for a 
while. Yeah. Let's see. How were

30:11.030 --> 30:15.674
diversity of student body? How were Hispanic 
students at A&M treated? The same as all of us.

30:22.281 --> 30:24.863
About the only minority group we had there were 
Hispanics. But most of the Hispanics came from the

30:25.990 --> 30:31.256
border, from Laredo. I'm not talking about the 
international Latin, ethnically Latin people.

30:38.345 --> 30:42.550
I'm talking about the Hispanics, Mexican 
Americans. No, they were absolutely no

30:42.570 --> 30:44.452
different. And were there any Asian students in 
the Corps, Asian American? Probably were, but you

30:50.700 --> 30:54.124
could probably count them on one hand at that time. 
Ironically, I remember one of the finest football

30:54.442 --> 31:00.770
players in my dad's day was a Japanese American. So 
they have a long history of going to A&M. Was that

31:03.954 --> 31:04.615
Kishi? Kishi, yeah. From Orange County. I didn't 
know that, but I remember looking at him and my dad

31:07.098 --> 31:10.142
talking about him all the time. My dad was a class of 
26. And one of the elder members of that family was

31:11.464 --> 31:21.917
confined early in World War II because his hobby 
was ham radio operating. No, I'd be darned. And

31:23.125 --> 31:25.140
they thought, of course, he must be spying. Then 
they found that...
