WEBVTT

00:02.731 --> 00:10.262
The community evidently decided they wanted A&M to invest more money.

00:10.302 --> 00:17.593
At the time, as far as I can recall, A&M ran geology summer field camp there.

00:18.034 --> 00:27.388
They also ran surveying courses at Junction, and they may have run some remedial math summer programs for high school students.

00:27.470 --> 00:39.235
But in any event, suddenly I wake up one day and I find out that the legislature has given this to Texas Tech to run.

00:39.997 --> 00:41.640
Now, I was never in that loop.

00:41.801 --> 00:46.170
And that's why I say my department head

00:46.555 --> 00:53.706
probably, Terry was not a good person to be a department head, an administrator.

00:54.868 --> 01:07.568
So this got swept out from under our research facility, which later on would have become, with more people on the staff, could have become a major research facility for the institution.

01:08.020 --> 01:11.547
Very, very fine example of a missed opportunity.

01:12.129 --> 01:18.221
Do you remember any possible grants or research funding chances?

01:18.241 --> 01:23.312
Not that I was involved in, but I'm sure there were

01:24.001 --> 01:27.867
numerous opportunities, I mean, grants that were turned down.

01:29.970 --> 01:34.396
The life of a professor in that college was writing proposals.

01:35.658 --> 01:43.630
But our, I mean, I think the college as a whole could be very proud of the fact that

01:44.065 --> 01:52.377
on a per capita basis, we were bringing more research dollars into the university than any of the other colleges.

01:52.397 --> 01:54.740
And most of it was competitive.

01:54.760 --> 01:56.262
Not all of it, but most of it.

01:57.965 --> 02:01.209
A while ago, you were giving high praise to Dr. Byers.

02:03.653 --> 02:11.524
What about, did you have any, you and your colleagues have any impression of Wayne Hall as the chief academic officer at A&M when you came?

02:11.656 --> 02:12.717
I didn't really.

02:13.018 --> 02:13.959
I mean, I met him.

02:14.239 --> 02:17.883
I vaguely recall him, but I had no impression.

02:17.923 --> 02:18.784
What about Earl Rudder?

02:21.907 --> 02:26.012
I have some mixed feelings about Earl, okay?

02:26.412 --> 02:31.198
When I came to A&M, I suppose you'd call me a young Turk.

02:31.798 --> 02:37.765
I was a member of AAUP, and

02:39.449 --> 02:47.409
It goes back to the case of a professor somewhere in one of the agricultural- Veterinary medicine.

02:48.211 --> 02:56.412
Vet medicine, who was in the process of getting a divorce and was dating somebody else.

02:56.830 --> 03:07.125
And the department head, as far as I can recall, the department head felt this was wrong and whatever.

03:07.485 --> 03:19.783
I don't know the full story, except I certainly didn't believe that one's personal life should be separate from what kind of a job one is doing.

03:20.708 --> 03:26.687
And I can remember going with a group of AUP people to talk with Rudder.

03:28.513 --> 03:33.368
And Rudder, being Rudder, told us where we were to get off.

03:33.652 --> 03:34.353
Now, I don't know.

03:34.594 --> 03:37.318
Wayne Hall, maybe he was dean at that time or not.

03:37.939 --> 03:38.380
I don't know.

03:38.741 --> 03:39.923
I don't know.

03:40.524 --> 03:48.237
But, you know, I saw this happen again in my own college many years later.

03:50.601 --> 03:51.863
Maybe we should talk off.

03:54.323 --> 04:04.054
With Mr. Rudder's passing, we soon had Jack Williams here in early 1971.

04:04.134 --> 04:21.293
Now, before he came, though, there had been some basic changes made in the 60s of co-education, non-compulsory corps of cadets, racial integration, higher admission requirements, broadening of the curriculum,

04:21.577 --> 04:26.202
How did those changes begin to affect you and your colleagues?

04:28.944 --> 04:38.254
Well, I think the biggest effect is that we soon had an enrollment of some very capable women coming into the college.

04:40.957 --> 04:48.124
In geophysics through the 70s, early 80s, we recruited

04:48.172 --> 04:52.839
students using scholarship money that was given us by the petroleum companies.

04:54.120 --> 04:57.044
And we did that both the graduate and the undergraduate level.

04:57.786 --> 05:01.170
And we were very successful for a number of years there.

05:01.230 --> 05:09.522
We always had small classes, but we had outstanding students.

05:12.725 --> 05:22.237
In geophysics, it's been particularly hard to recruit women faculty, for example.

05:23.238 --> 05:32.269
And I've known of a couple of our graduate students that we dearly would have loved to have gone into teaching and chose to go with industry.

05:32.349 --> 05:39.238
That's one of the problems we had in geophysics is that these very good young women

05:40.788 --> 05:45.352
would go to industry and frequently not go on to graduate work.

05:45.573 --> 05:59.886
In terms of minority students, again, in geophysics, geophysics is not the most attractive discipline for somebody coming out of high school or even out of college.

06:00.267 --> 06:00.827
Why not?

06:02.168 --> 06:03.750
Number one, I think visibility.

06:05.372 --> 06:06.913
People know about engineering.

06:07.822 --> 06:11.245
and they know about oceanography, but usually it's only biology.

06:13.147 --> 06:16.550
They don't understand how geophysics applies.

06:17.470 --> 06:22.495
It doesn't have that milieu that goes with being an engineer.

06:23.296 --> 06:28.860
And so, you have, and furthermore, it's very demanding.

06:29.061 --> 06:31.883
That is, you have to have both math and physics skills.

06:33.765 --> 06:37.508
And so, again, that limits

06:39.260 --> 06:52.630
Now, for some years there, in the 70s and early 80s, our undergraduates walking out with a B.S.

06:52.690 --> 06:56.458
in geophysics were just snapped up by industry left and right.

06:57.434 --> 06:59.018
You couldn't get students to go on.

06:59.058 --> 07:02.887
Very few of them would go on to graduate school.

07:03.568 --> 07:05.653
And we had a few women.

07:06.656 --> 07:11.828
But I can only recall one or two minority students.

07:12.229 --> 07:15.797
The picture you are painting of geophysics,

07:16.267 --> 07:22.982
I presume that would be true nationally, that it's not that well known among high school students.

07:24.205 --> 07:27.492
It is thought by many to be intimidating

07:28.012 --> 07:30.015
they're not really sure what it leads to.

07:30.095 --> 07:31.297
Is that true nationally?

07:31.477 --> 07:32.618
That's true nationally.

07:33.119 --> 07:41.190
And in fact, Bob Unneberger eventually put together a program where we send out material.

07:41.611 --> 07:50.824
We get the listings of national science scholarship students, national merit scholarship students, and send it out nationwide.

07:51.084 --> 07:54.689
And we also send out the Society of Exploration Geophysics.

07:54.709 --> 07:56.652
We send out their literature.

07:56.632 --> 07:59.514
And that worked great for about 10 or 12 years.

07:59.895 --> 08:01.656
All right, now you mentioned Bob Unterberger.

08:01.756 --> 08:08.662
I remember roughly when he was being courted in the 1960s.

08:09.663 --> 08:12.786
Do you remember anything about who found him and how he got here?

08:14.447 --> 08:19.031
He came, I'm not sure if it was the same year as Terry Spencer or a year later.

08:20.412 --> 08:25.997
And I was not on the search committee, so I don't recall.

08:26.399 --> 08:28.904
But, of course, he came with Betty.

08:29.365 --> 08:30.587
Where was he?

08:31.068 --> 08:36.819
He was a colleague of Terry's in industry, I think.

08:36.839 --> 08:38.883
I think they came from the same company.

08:38.903 --> 08:40.186
From out in California?

08:40.246 --> 08:41.488
From California.

08:41.468 --> 08:45.076
Now, Bob was a graduate of Duke.

08:45.096 --> 08:46.459
That's where his PhD was.

08:46.779 --> 08:59.747
Because I was working then as an assistant dean of the graduate school and assistant vice president of academic affairs for Wayne Hall, and one of the—they were courting

08:59.727 --> 09:22.933
Dr. Unterberger, Bob Unterberger, and I remember his showing me Mrs. Betty, also Dr. Unterberger, showing me her resume and apparently one, this is a guess on my part, I gather that Bob finally said he would not accept an appointment here unless a slot was found for Betty.

09:22.913 --> 09:31.903
I'm sure that that's the situation, but I was not involved in, and I'm sure Terry is the one that initiated the search.

09:32.163 --> 09:35.627
What was his, what are Bob Anderberger's specialties?

09:35.767 --> 09:37.609
Okay, he's an applied geophysicist.

09:38.010 --> 09:40.913
He was doing electrical type of studies.

09:42.094 --> 09:49.883
He had also done rubidium vapor magnetometry.

09:51.483 --> 10:05.549
When he came to A&M, his major research interests were looking at the electrical conductivity in salt domes to try to understand the structure of salt domes.

10:06.070 --> 10:10.197
It turns out there are wet domes and dry domes and so forth.

10:10.218 --> 10:12.422
So, that was his research area.

10:12.442 --> 10:13.744
He was using radar.

10:14.112 --> 10:19.819
He was one of the pioneers in using radar as a geophysical tool.

10:21.081 --> 10:32.636
And he demonstrated that you could transmit in dry solid, you could transmit electrical energy or electromagnetic energy in an extremely long way.

10:32.656 --> 10:36.981
As you all got the department really into high gear,

10:37.248 --> 10:46.465
Can you guesstimate the number of graduating seniors and graduate degrees in an average year?

10:46.799 --> 10:58.914
Never large, probably in our heyday, we were probably graduating 12 to 15 undergraduates, something of that order.

11:00.116 --> 11:12.672
And if you, in terms of graduate students, probably three or four PhDs and six or eight MSs, something of that order.

11:13.141 --> 11:23.732
But that would also include people perhaps that were geologists doing tectonophysics and were heavily into geophysics as a tool.

11:24.372 --> 11:33.521
And in those years, the relationships between the departments within the College of Geosciences were comparatively positive and strong?

11:34.863 --> 11:39.047
There's always been a little bit of an east-west, well, a tilt

11:40.293 --> 11:51.525
a jousting between Oceanography Meteorology over there in the O&M building, and Geology Geophysics over there in the Halbooty building.

11:51.925 --> 11:55.249
And the Dean's office is over there in the O&M building.

11:55.909 --> 12:04.258
And so we've always had, or hopefully had, an Associate Dean for Research

12:04.323 --> 12:08.850
And the question always was, well, sometimes we've had two.

12:09.130 --> 12:16.320
One from the solid Earth and the other from oceanography and meteorology.

12:16.681 --> 12:17.482
Oh, OK.

12:17.502 --> 12:18.223
OK.

12:18.263 --> 12:18.924
Now, let's see.

12:18.984 --> 12:20.987
The Deans, Byers was a?

12:22.309 --> 12:23.190
Meteorologist.

12:23.491 --> 12:24.032
OK.

12:24.092 --> 12:25.694
Then Cook?

12:25.794 --> 12:26.515
Geographer.

12:27.116 --> 12:27.477
All right.

12:27.537 --> 12:29.199
And who was next?

12:29.279 --> 12:29.740
Friedman.

12:31.142 --> 12:33.165
And he's a geologist.

12:33.230 --> 12:38.017
Then after him... Bob Deuce, he's a chemical atmospheric chemist.

12:39.859 --> 12:46.508
And now Dave Pryor is a geologist.

12:46.528 --> 12:48.892
Right, now I'm not going to ask you the negative on this.

12:49.512 --> 12:52.677
Looking back over all... Oh, in between there, there was Gordon Eaton.

12:52.997 --> 12:54.579
Gordon, oh yes, yes.

12:54.599 --> 12:55.941
He's an oceanographer.

12:56.021 --> 12:56.742
Before Friedman.

12:56.823 --> 12:57.904
Isn't he an oceanographer?

12:58.272 --> 13:01.036
He's a geologist, volcanologist.

13:01.156 --> 13:02.638
He's a geologist.

13:02.999 --> 13:03.219
All right.

13:03.460 --> 13:06.304
Looking at all of those deans, I'm not going to ask you the negative.

13:06.985 --> 13:13.113
To which of those would you give the highest grades for successes in leading the college?

13:14.055 --> 13:14.656
Gordon Eaton.

13:15.877 --> 13:16.178
Why?

13:16.438 --> 13:16.939
Why?

13:18.961 --> 13:20.163
I'm not disagreeing with you.

13:20.243 --> 13:21.925
No, no.

13:22.666 --> 13:25.650
In my view, it was a sad day when he moved up.

13:28.735 --> 13:33.041
Gordon is just a really fine administrator in a quiet way.

13:33.081 --> 13:41.693
He's highly respected as a scientist, and for some reason, he's been through the mill.

13:41.773 --> 13:46.099
He had done administration in the survey, and of course he went

13:46.366 --> 14:14.027
went from there to Iowa State, and then he went to LDGO as director, and then he went on to downsize the survey before, save it from, but somehow or other, he had, it's hard to put it into words, the fact, aside from total integrity, he had vast knowledge of

14:14.378 --> 14:15.839
What was going on?

14:15.979 --> 14:17.821
And he was a good people person.

14:18.161 --> 14:20.343
Oh, yeah.

14:20.624 --> 14:28.631
Now, Mel, we've always been lucky in our college, I think, in that all our deans had integrity.

14:29.572 --> 14:42.343
Now, they had different styles, but Mel Friedman, Mel's biggest problem was that he made decisions too quickly.

14:43.252 --> 14:45.415
You know, he cleared his desk every night.

14:46.076 --> 14:49.922
And sometimes he'd make a decision that maybe he later should have regretted.

14:51.004 --> 14:54.690
I have a slight link to him academically.

14:55.431 --> 14:59.397
He walked across the stage to get his Ph.D.

14:59.437 --> 15:05.226
at Rice the same night I did, and he was immediately behind me in the line.

15:05.611 --> 15:08.496
as they lined us up.

15:08.676 --> 15:15.047
I've never understood how a Green Hut and a Monroe could be, but I remember we were near each other.

15:16.609 --> 15:30.673
There was a, help me remember the name, under Mr. Rutter, we had a vice president for research, who was a kind of a character,

15:32.476 --> 15:35.466
And he would not survive very long under Dr. Williams.

15:36.389 --> 15:41.827
He lived by himself at the new... Oh, I remember that character.

15:42.128 --> 15:43.412
He lived up on the tower.

15:43.673 --> 15:44.275
Yes.

15:44.744 --> 15:46.787
And what was his name?

15:46.887 --> 15:50.091
And he was supposed to be a great guru.

15:50.231 --> 15:50.632
I don't know.

15:50.692 --> 15:52.014
Now, wait a minute.

15:52.034 --> 15:53.977
He was supposed to do something about Galveston.

15:54.217 --> 15:54.477
Right.

15:55.018 --> 16:08.997
Because for those of us in the humanities, we didn't like him because one time he addressed the arts and sciences faculty and told us that research that was not funded was not worth doing.

16:09.348 --> 16:14.655
If someone would not pay to fund it, then it was not of any value at all.

16:15.316 --> 16:25.751
And that he, as we understood him also, that he said that you can measure the value of it by how much someone is willing to fund it.

16:26.131 --> 16:28.615
That the bigger the grant, the more important the topic.

16:29.716 --> 16:30.798
He didn't last long.

16:30.858 --> 16:31.098
No.

16:31.238 --> 16:37.667
And I've forgotten his name, but I remember he was sort of, I felt he was sort of a,

16:37.968 --> 16:39.270
slimy character.

16:39.470 --> 16:42.134
I mean, whatever, but I didn't like him.

16:42.935 --> 16:47.201
And didn't he go on to one of the medical institutions in Houston?

16:47.662 --> 16:48.503
Yes, yes.

16:49.044 --> 16:50.646
No, at Galveston.

16:51.027 --> 16:52.429
The medical branch at Galveston.

16:52.469 --> 16:55.293
He supposedly was going to bring them research glory, too.

16:56.435 --> 16:58.558
And I don't know what happened to him after that.

16:58.538 --> 17:10.470
Let's see, Mr. Rudder suddenly died one month before his 60th birthday in 1970, and then that fall Jack Williams came.

17:11.210 --> 17:15.975
Did you and your colleagues have any impression of him as the president of Texas A&M?

17:18.437 --> 17:19.078
I have.

17:19.098 --> 17:21.580
I don't know if my colleagues do.

17:21.600 --> 17:26.385
I have because I was on the

17:27.648 --> 17:38.343
That committee that was supposed to resolve these faculty issues over, what is it, tenure and advisory tenure, academic advisory and tenure committee.

17:39.544 --> 17:51.541
In my first year on that committee, we had a major debacle going on in bioengineering.

17:53.203 --> 17:55.326
I've forgotten the name of the

17:55.795 --> 18:14.952
individual, but a faculty member was in direct combat with the department head, and the department head sort of banished this guy to Texarkana, I think.

18:15.472 --> 18:17.855
I don't know, we had a branch up there or something.

18:18.455 --> 18:26.485
But in any event, this issue came to that committee, and we held hearings all spring.

18:27.986 --> 18:42.323
And in order to, I can remember, sort of interesting, we wanted to have input from Dean Benson.

18:44.243 --> 18:50.929
And Dean Benson said he would not appear before the committee.

18:51.790 --> 18:57.055
All we had to do, our committee reported, didn't report through any channel.

18:57.175 --> 19:01.379
It reported to Director Jack Williams, Dean Benson appeared before the committee.

19:02.600 --> 19:12.630
And we never, I mean, we had a, we thought we had maybe a solution that would have been satisfactory.

19:12.948 --> 19:16.392
Fortunately, both people disappeared at the end of that semester.

19:17.153 --> 19:18.335
I don't know whether you remember that.

19:19.957 --> 19:22.480
And then two years later, I was chairman of that committee.

19:22.820 --> 19:25.043
But fortunately, we didn't have any disasters.

19:25.944 --> 19:31.571
So, you know, I had high regard for, personally, for Jack Williams and his values.

19:32.132 --> 19:38.820
But I don't think anybody, he really didn't, as far as I recall, affect our teaching and so forth.

19:39.442 --> 19:45.893
What about John Calhoun, who became Vice President when Dr. Byers retired?

19:46.654 --> 19:54.227
We have very warm feelings for John, because he was very supportive of earth sciences.

19:54.808 --> 19:57.332
What were his many qualities as you all saw them?

19:57.352 --> 20:03.002
Well, and again, I didn't...

20:04.990 --> 20:10.058
All I can remember is he got some things done, and I don't know what they were at the time.

20:10.159 --> 20:21.357
But he was probably very instrumental in the oceanography program, I think, more than in the solid earth sciences.

20:21.838 --> 20:24.783
But again, you'll have to ask John what he did.

20:24.803 --> 20:25.905
He did so many things.

20:27.367 --> 20:30.272
And I've known him off and on, but not on a

20:31.400 --> 20:44.594
a working level, except I know he had me on a, I was getting checks at one time from C-Crad or something, it was early years or something, and I didn't know what my responsibilities were.

20:44.674 --> 20:48.198
I don't know why I was put on this, but they said, call Calhoun.

20:50.600 --> 20:54.304
But no, I can't really add, I can't add to that.

20:54.324 --> 20:57.588
You mentioned that you became one of the associate deans.

20:58.789 --> 20:59.770
About when was that?

20:59.800 --> 21:01.962
Okay, that's another story.

21:05.546 --> 21:20.021
During Earl Cook's regime service, Joe Sonnenfeld was an Associate Dean, or I don't know, the Assistant Dean for Student Affairs.

21:21.823 --> 21:25.707
And he was going back full-time to teaching.

21:26.513 --> 21:42.196
And I'm not sure whether Ken Brundage was in line to do that or not, but Ken couldn't for— Earl called me up and said, I had some good reviews by students or something.

21:43.758 --> 21:51.610
He called me up, maybe somebody recommended me, but in any event, he called me up and asked me if I would substitute for a semester.

21:53.547 --> 21:55.910
as an assistant dean.

21:57.853 --> 22:05.282
So I went over and I sat down with Earl, and I said, okay, first of all, I would only do it half-time.

22:05.723 --> 22:07.986
I was still teaching, and I've always done that.

22:08.606 --> 22:14.414
But I said, Earl, what if I like doing this, and I'm doing a good job?

22:15.255 --> 22:17.338
You know, maybe I want to continue.

22:19.340 --> 22:21.563
So at that time, he said, yeah, okay.

22:22.758 --> 22:30.736
So I went over, and I was assistant dean in charge of the undergraduate and graduate instructional programs.

22:31.517 --> 22:37.290
And of course, it's a small college.

22:38.840 --> 22:41.963
a tremendous job.

22:41.983 --> 22:45.387
It isn't like the business college, where you've got several thousand students.

22:45.467 --> 22:51.674
At most, we had, I think our enrollment got up to 1,000 total at maximum.

22:55.278 --> 23:00.383
And I certainly knew all the faculty members in the small college.

23:00.503 --> 23:01.985
I knew all the faculty members.

23:03.967 --> 23:08.492
I knew most of the support people.

23:09.130 --> 23:17.100
So I could manage very well in a non-antagonistic way.

23:17.300 --> 23:22.126
I mean, I think I did a good job in low key.

23:22.286 --> 23:26.231
And I had been there as an assistant dean.

23:26.251 --> 23:28.994
I don't remember two years when Gordon took over.

23:30.717 --> 23:37.585
And he immediately boosted my title up to associate so that I'd be on a par with these other people and these other

23:38.932 --> 23:40.674
How many years did you do that?

23:41.756 --> 23:42.997
Total, fourteen.

23:43.598 --> 23:44.079
Fourteen.

23:45.220 --> 23:59.138
During those years, share with this machine some of the types of issues that you worked with, with students and with others.

23:59.458 --> 24:04.264
What were the typical matters that came your way?

24:04.835 --> 24:05.819
Typical matters.

24:10.921 --> 24:13.191
I think the

24:13.610 --> 24:19.357
One of the overriding problems with students in our college was always the math problem.

24:19.817 --> 24:21.620
I mean, we're talking about academics now.

24:22.140 --> 24:24.003
The math problem.

24:24.183 --> 24:39.381
Trying to get students to understand that they needed to, even to do applied science, like geology, they still needed to do well in mathematics.

24:39.361 --> 24:49.119
And as a result, you know, many of these students wanted to go off to Blinn to take math and chemistry.

24:50.461 --> 25:00.660
And I don't know if it's possible today to say no, but I would not allow them to take any of their basic math off campus.

25:01.535 --> 25:07.103
Now, it didn't mean necessarily that the teaching at Blinn is bad.

25:07.263 --> 25:12.431
In fact, they may spend more time with students, but they didn't always cover as much material.

25:12.491 --> 25:16.036
And the students would come back and take the next semester calculus and they're in trouble.

25:16.677 --> 25:17.979
That certainly was one problem.

25:18.580 --> 25:19.682
Let's stay with that a second.

25:20.262 --> 25:26.091
On the math, were there times when you had the impression

25:26.695 --> 25:32.347
that our mathematics faculty did not care enough about the students in those basic courses?

25:33.610 --> 25:37.478
Well, that was an issue because I was a member of AOC for years and years.

25:37.719 --> 25:40.164
And, of course, that was an issue that frequently discussed.

25:43.351 --> 25:46.999
I think the basic problem, not so much that

25:48.667 --> 25:51.397
It was true of some of the math teachers.

25:51.638 --> 25:53.043
They probably couldn't have cared less.

25:53.765 --> 25:58.643
But when you're faced with teaching a class 100 students in calculus,

25:58.893 --> 26:03.658
And then you assign the, I mean, for the lectures.

26:03.678 --> 26:11.245
And then the problem sessions are smaller, but they're assigned to graduate students of varying skills.

26:11.986 --> 26:14.048
And national backgrounds.

26:14.188 --> 26:19.774
And national backgrounds, obviously, you know, those issues used to come up at AOC.

26:20.795 --> 26:26.200
Now, one thing I did do, I'm trying to remember now,

26:26.180 --> 26:39.358
At one time, A&M entering students took the SAT only.

26:39.378 --> 26:40.219
What is the other?

26:40.740 --> 26:41.281
ACT.

26:41.641 --> 26:43.564
ACT, okay.

26:43.584 --> 26:52.997
I am the one that raised that issue before the AOC that really made it possible for students to use ACT scores.

26:53.821 --> 27:04.655
And it turns out, for example, as I pointed out, one of the problems may have been, I've got to be a little careful, better turn that off a minute.

27:07.558 --> 27:12.084
Matt, what were some of the other problems that the Associate Dean dealt with?

27:13.726 --> 27:15.508
Oh, well,

27:17.159 --> 27:26.771
I can remember one afternoon where I had a student that was in difficulty and had asked her to come in to see me.

27:28.893 --> 27:38.185
And I've forgotten whether she was on probation, but she showed up in her cocktail dress.

27:39.606 --> 27:40.247
She was

27:40.767 --> 27:44.372
going on to work at one of the local cocktail lounges.

27:44.592 --> 27:48.557
And she created a certain amount of consternation in the dean's office.

27:51.561 --> 27:58.330
So I don't know whether that was a problem or a pleasure.

27:59.391 --> 28:10.285
One of the things that I tried to do and did not succeed, I wanted to see our

28:11.108 --> 28:29.117
Geology 101, the general course for non-majors, which is the bread and butter in the college, replaced with a two-semester sequence that integrated all the earth sciences.

28:30.143 --> 28:33.788
I felt this was important for several reasons.

28:37.152 --> 28:50.949
Perhaps one is that I felt all these young people going out from A&M, they need to know something about the atmosphere, the river, flood plains of rivers.

28:51.590 --> 28:52.571
They're going to be citizens.

28:52.591 --> 28:54.413
They're going to have to vote on these issues.

28:55.118 --> 29:04.436
And I felt that you could really put together a really dynamic, great course that integrated those disciplines.

29:07.001 --> 29:10.548
I suddenly found I was treading on turf.

29:12.192 --> 29:14.376
And so that got shelved.

29:16.077 --> 29:25.345
And I was pleased that Bob Deuce later, that was one of his agenda items.

29:25.477 --> 29:34.130
I don't think anything's ever happened to it now, but I still think that that would have been a very positive thing for us to do.

29:34.451 --> 29:38.858
I agree with you entirely on that one.

29:39.338 --> 29:51.417
Did you ever have any, and don't mention any names if you have any response to this, did you ever have any person off campus, a board member,

29:51.397 --> 29:58.827
a wealthy Texan, a politician, or anybody attempt to twist your arm in any way on any student matter?

29:59.267 --> 29:59.488
No.

30:00.850 --> 30:06.097
Not in my, not, maybe the dean, maybe the dean did.

30:06.317 --> 30:07.218
But you never did.

30:07.238 --> 30:08.540
But it never came down to me.

30:08.580 --> 30:18.433
And for example, Mike Halbooty had a nephew who came to A&M,

30:18.903 --> 30:21.328
And Mike said, you know, you're on your own.

30:21.628 --> 30:23.572
And he flunked out after the first semester.

30:24.213 --> 30:26.377
Never, no problems.

30:26.918 --> 30:27.599
No problems.

30:27.619 --> 30:28.200
Very good.

30:28.220 --> 30:29.102
I give a lot of credit.

30:29.603 --> 30:32.929
So I never had that, I've had

30:34.023 --> 30:46.068
parents that have screamed at me, but I've never had pressure that came on me directly from board members or politicians or so forth.

30:46.088 --> 30:52.341
Did you ever have a parent threaten you that they were going to get you fired or anything like that?

30:52.361 --> 30:53.483
Did any parent ever

30:53.598 --> 31:01.891
No, but I've had one tell me that I was a lousy, lousy dean and I was a horrible person and so forth and so on.

31:03.093 --> 31:05.697
And I'm going to go to the dean and talk about this.

31:05.737 --> 31:14.070
And I've had, certainly had parents that have gone over my head to talk with the dean.

31:14.557 --> 31:16.019
All right, let's go to the other side.

31:16.079 --> 31:35.383
Share and let's record some positive recollections you have about how a decision that you made regarding a student later turned out that student came back and had some good words.
