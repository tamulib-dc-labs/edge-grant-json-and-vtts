WEBVTT

00:01.735 --> 00:05.500
very much surprised at how peaceful things seemed 
to be. It had no sense of impending doom or

00:05.741 --> 00:09.726
anything. Can you carry us from that point till you 
got back to your hotel? One of the things that I was

00:15.395 --> 00:23.026
thinking was I wish that our whole family was there 
so that they could see what's going on. There's no

00:23.346 --> 00:31.658
way, I knew there was no way I could explain how 
peaceful and how cooperative these people were

00:23.346 --> 00:31.658
because many times when we were over here, Very 
seldom do we see people helping each other out,

00:32.110 --> 00:38.841
people united in a common cause, a common idea. And 
even when you would try to get on a Chinese bus, it

00:38.881 --> 00:44.149
was survival of the fittest. And they would run 
over you to get onto the bus. But here, you had more

00:47.374 --> 00:53.664
people in a potentially dangerous situation, but 
they were very calm. They were very helpful to each

00:54.225 --> 00:59.974
other. It just, it was something that we had never 
experienced. You're comparing the crowd in June

01:04.426 --> 01:17.861
of 1989 as peaceful and calm compared to the daily 
activity, crowds, and movement in Beijing back in

01:04.426 --> 01:17.861
your 85, 86 school year. Yes, yes. I said there were 
more people, and I said there were just, you could

01:19.663 --> 01:30.636
see that these people, although I could not 
understand what they were saying, that they were

01:19.663 --> 01:30.636
pleading with these troops not to go into 
Tiananmen Square. You felt that's what they were

01:33.615 --> 01:35.657
doing? Oh, yeah. There was no doubt in my mind. They 
were trying to tell these troops that these were

01:38.259 --> 01:57.136
people down in Tiananmen Square, students and 
otherwise, and that they were not ruffians or

01:38.259 --> 01:57.136
hooligans that were causing destruction or 
anything like that, and trying to explain the

01:38.259 --> 01:57.136
general situation and what was going on. It was a 
very... friendly type of thing. The soldiers were

02:01.812 --> 02:28.855
doing more listening than talking, and they had a 
rather solemn look on their face for the most part,

02:01.812 --> 02:28.855
but it was not what it could have been and what I 
could have imagined as a confrontational type of

02:01.812 --> 02:28.855
situation, even though there were, I would guess 
here at this intersection by this time, there were

02:01.812 --> 02:28.855
maybe 5,000 to 10,000 people, because they 
literally covered This whole interchange there

02:29.290 --> 02:33.135
was thick with people.

02:36.779 --> 02:41.525
But I said it was a very peaceful atmosphere. And 
people did not seem to be afraid. I mean, when

02:44.128 --> 02:45.951
somebody's afraid, you can see it in their eyes. 
You can see it in the way they were acting. And these

02:47.573 --> 02:49.775
people were not acting that way. It was a very 
friendly type of thing. And the Chinese people,

02:54.061 --> 02:55.983
they love their children. They're not going to put 
their children what they would feel is a

02:58.906 --> 03:02.030
potentially dangerous situation. Yet there were 
children all over. They were playing on the grass

03:04.333 --> 03:13.526
nearby, and walking around, and children talking 
with troops too. So it was a very peaceful setting.

03:18.213 --> 03:25.082
So you were still walking, still heading for the 
taxi? So about 9.30, I figured, well, you know, I

03:25.349 --> 03:30.273
better go ahead and get back again. Nothing out of 
the ordinary seemed to be happening. So I walked on

03:34.397 --> 03:36.979
to the Friendship store. It was closed by this 
time, so there weren't any taxis there, so I had to

03:37.580 --> 03:44.125
go down to one of the foreign hotels that's a little 
bit further on. And there were a couple of taxis

03:45.046 --> 03:55.035
there, but they weren't too enthused about taking 
someone somewhere, so I had to bargain with this

03:55.454 --> 03:56.575
guy. He wanted 50 or 60 yuan to take me what is 
usually a 15 yuan drive. He said, oh yeah, but

04:04.605 --> 04:08.589
there's a lot of demonstrators out and stuff. So we 
bargained down to 25 yuan to take me over to my

04:08.770 --> 04:13.795
hotel. What was the name of your hotel again? I was 
at the Kunlun Hotel, which is in the northeast side

04:16.238 --> 04:21.504
of the city. So I got into the cab. And he started 
down one of the main streets of parallels, that

04:24.125 --> 04:36.541
ring road, to get over to where my hotel was. And we 
came on. There weren't a whole lot of people out in

04:38.663 --> 04:40.325
the street. We came on one intersection where the 
students or the people had pulled buses across to

04:40.365 --> 04:50.578
block this main street. There were about a half a 
dozen buses in kind of a half-moon shape so that

04:52.677 --> 05:03.931
they'd block the street that we were on on the other 
side of the intersection and the two that were

04:52.677 --> 05:03.931
coming in. Figured that if convoys tried to come in 
that way, they wouldn't be able to get around that.

05:07.495 --> 05:12.261
But fortunately, there was enough space that he 
could get the car between two of the buses. And you

05:12.281 --> 05:19.950
have the main street, and then they have these 
separate bicycle lanes on the side. And a lot of

05:20.369 --> 05:27.720
times there's a divider with some grass that's in 
between the main street and the bicycle lane. He

05:27.740 --> 05:31.526
had to go over the bicycle lane to go down that. But 
it was to get back on the street after we got past

05:31.646 --> 05:36.793
that. So I got back to the hotel then until about 10 
o'clock in the evening, Beijing time, and called

05:36.813 --> 05:48.030
home. to tell my wife and the kids that everything 
was okay. I felt I couldn't tell them that I'd just

05:53.813 --> 05:57.759
been down to the square and I'd just run into a bunch 
of troops. You felt you couldn't tell them? I felt I

05:59.541 --> 06:00.202
could not. Number one, because you don't know who 
may be listening in on the phone. And I did not want

06:06.111 --> 06:10.458
to draw any suspicion on myself. But you didn't 
have any difficulty making the phone call out. I

06:12.861 --> 06:14.684
didn't have any difficulty making the phone call 
out. And my daughter answered the phone. And my

06:18.723 --> 06:23.089
wife had just taken our youngest son to his t-ball 
game. But I told my daughter, I said, hey, you know,

06:24.190 --> 06:27.114
everything's fine. You know, just, you know, come 
on over. And I tried to explain without telling her

06:29.797 --> 06:37.848
where I had been and what I had done. I tried to tell 
her to bring along some extra cash. So because one

06:43.765 --> 06:52.057
of the things that the students needed was money, 
and particularly with dollars in that, they could

06:43.765 --> 06:52.057
get a lot more in terms of food and things like that. 
I wanted to have that ability to make some

06:52.999 --> 07:00.310
donations, but I needed cash rather than 
traveler's checks. So without telling her what I

07:00.330 --> 07:10.785
wanted it for, I was trying to explain to bring that 
over and wanted them to bring some Texas A&M

07:11.407 --> 07:17.594
t-shirts over so that we could get our pictures 
taken in front of the Goddess of Democracy with our

07:11.407 --> 07:17.594
A&M t-shirts. And as we were talking, and 
apparently she had been watching television, she

07:19.356 --> 07:29.466
said that they had just broken in on the news and 
said that there was some shooting going on in

07:19.356 --> 07:29.466
Beijing. And I told her, I said, well, if there is, 
that must be an isolated incident that wasn't

07:31.108 --> 07:39.237
really... and that everything was peaceful. Now, 
she's watching TV on Sunday night? No, this was

07:44.164 --> 07:45.525
Saturday morning here. It was Saturday night in 
Beijing. It was Saturday morning back here in the

07:48.708 --> 07:53.512
state. So she,

07:54.253 --> 08:04.282
I told her everything was fine, and, you know, to 
tell her mother that everything was okay and we

07:54.253 --> 08:04.282
were coming over. So I went ahead and went to bed, 
and then about An hour later, my wife had gotten

08:09.862 --> 08:16.009
back from the T-ball

08:09.862 --> 08:16.009
game. She called me and said, you know, are you sure 
that everything's okay? Because they're talking

08:22.276 --> 08:24.338
about some real shooting going on. And I said, 
well, you know, I can't, I was on the northeast

08:25.259 --> 08:30.004
side. I was about two and a half, three miles away 
from Tiananmen Square. I couldn't hear anything

08:34.810 --> 08:35.971
in my room. And I told her, you know, I thought 
everything was okay, but I, as it turned out, I was

08:40.405 --> 08:46.334
in one of the few hotels in Beijing that has a 
satellite hookup to CNN. And so I said, you know

08:46.394 --> 08:51.721
what, I'll turn on the TV and see what I can see from 
here. And instructed her to go ahead and call me

08:52.763 --> 09:10.328
early Sunday morning, Beijing time, which would 
be Saturday evening, her time, so that we could

08:52.763 --> 09:10.328
assess the situation to see what's going on.

09:11.725 --> 09:18.672
early on Sunday morning, she was going to have to 
drive to Houston, Sunday morning Houston time,

09:11.725 --> 09:18.672
drive to Houston to take our kids and put them on the 
plane. So, I then stayed up that night watching

09:19.653 --> 09:40.534
CNN, watching what was going on, and was as 
horrified as, you know, everybody back in the

09:19.653 --> 09:40.534
States, as to why I was just, and thinking, you 
know, I was just, I was just down there, and piecing

09:19.653 --> 09:40.534
things together, since I've been back, realized 
that just about the time that I left that group on

09:41.577 --> 09:59.774
the east side of Tiananmen Square, another group 
of soldiers from this unit that was in Mongolia had

09:41.577 --> 09:59.774
come down Chong Lin Avenue from the west side. And 
when the people came out to stop them, just as they

10:00.976 --> 10:08.543
had done to this convoy that I had been with, those 
guys didn't stop. They opened fire. on the people

10:11.058 --> 10:17.645
and ran over people and continued down on to in the 
Tiananmen Square. And that apparently was the

10:18.146 --> 10:25.534
shooting that my daughter had first heard being 
reported. I do know that later that night, early

10:26.375 --> 10:37.707
Sunday morning, in that area where I was, that 
that's where some of the tanks came through. Now,

10:38.210 --> 10:49.662
there's no way of knowing whether the troops that I 
saw then ended up shooting at the people who were

10:38.210 --> 10:49.662
around there or they remained peaceful and did not 
shoot. One of the things that I have found out since

10:50.483 --> 11:01.595
returning was that those soldiers were told by 
their commanders that when they were given the

10:50.483 --> 11:01.595
order to shoot, they better shoot. And if they 
didn't, that the commander would kill them right

11:01.875 --> 11:04.858
on the spot. As a matter of fact, that And where did 
you obtain that information? I obtained

11:11.536 --> 11:29.904
information from a lot of different sources, from 
contacts, from some,

11:11.536 --> 11:29.904
there were four students, a newspaper, people 
from Hong Kong who were in the square that night.

11:30.766 --> 11:35.453
And they were, they came to A&M. afterwards to 
discuss their experiences and from other

11:36.293 --> 12:06.250
contexts that I know but feel that for their own 
safety that I shouldn't identify them can I take

11:36.293 --> 12:06.250
you back then to when you're in the hotel in the 
middle of the night watching the television

11:36.293 --> 12:06.250
coverage what was probably the most vivid scene 
that you remember from watching television at

11:36.293 --> 12:06.250
that point in time they they were showing mainly 
still pictures. Of course, the government was

12:10.205 --> 12:20.537
trying its best to keep the news media from being 
able to send out information. And there wasn't any

12:21.478 --> 12:27.506
one in particular that stands out. The thought 
that kept going through my mind was the fact that I

12:27.946 --> 12:32.512
had just been down there and things were so 
peaceful. And that The only thought in my mind was

12:35.575 --> 12:46.189
how desperate the hard lines, the government, 
Deng Xiaoping, Li Peng, and that, were to maintain

12:35.575 --> 12:46.189
their power. Because this was an act of sheer 
desperation. I was convinced that it was not a case

12:49.112 --> 13:02.089
where the people had turned unruly and had forced 
the army into a situation where they needed a

12:49.112 --> 13:02.089
machine to protect themselves. It was clear in my 
mind, and piecing things together since I've come

13:02.812 --> 13:18.891
back, very clear that the government had made the 
cold-blooded, calculated decision to go in there

13:02.812 --> 13:18.891
and to clear the square by whatever violent means 
were necessary. Okay, so you were watching

13:19.392 --> 13:24.718
television, hearing commotion in the hotel? What 
did you finally do with the phone call to your wife?

13:27.759 --> 13:33.425
There was not a lot of commotion going to the hotel 
because there weren't a whole lot of people in the

13:27.759 --> 13:33.425
hotel. Tourism had been cut down drastically 
because of that. I couldn't help but think about

13:39.972 --> 13:53.727
the people that I'd seen down in the square and 
wondering if they had left already, that little

13:39.972 --> 13:53.727
boy that I'd seen, his mother, and the The high 
school girl in the back was a translator. I

13:57.932 --> 14:04.580
couldn't help but wondering if they were still 
there, if they were part of what was going on, if

13:57.932 --> 14:04.580
they had been able to get out of there. My wife was 
able to get a hold of me the next morning, and we both

14:05.401 --> 14:13.790
agreed that it was not wise to put the kids on the 
plane. Even though they wanted to come, we felt

14:13.850 --> 14:19.697
that it would be much safer and easier for me to get 
out of there if I just had to worry about myself. So

14:25.263 --> 14:29.087
you made this decision over the phone early Sunday 
morning. Yeah, and I said this was this was about

14:30.148 --> 14:48.807
five or six hours before she would have gotten in 
the car and taken down to the Houston airport and I

14:30.148 --> 14:48.807
told her that my plans were that I was going to that 
there was nothing open on Sunday. There was no way

14:51.364 --> 14:57.251
that I could make any arrangements to get out early 
on Sunday. As it turned out, I had, whatever

14:58.252 --> 15:10.227
possible, do not want to fly the Chinese airline, 
fly other airlines. So I had all foreign travel,

15:11.289 --> 15:18.017
except my daughter was going to, when we left, we 
were going to stop in Hong Kong, and she was going to

15:18.217 --> 15:28.428
stay an extra week with one of her friends that she 
had gone to school with when they were in Beijing.

15:29.970 --> 15:35.396
So we had already booked a flight for the following 
Sunday to go from Beijing to Hong Kong. We had to fly

15:35.416 --> 15:47.008
the Chinese airline for that leg, which turned out 
to be good in that I had a ticket then on the Chinese

15:35.416 --> 15:47.008
airline from Beijing to Hong Kong, and they had an 
office There was the Great Royal Hotel a block away

15:48.085 --> 15:57.979
from where I was staying, whereas all the other 
foreign airlines, the only place that they had

15:48.085 --> 15:57.979
their offices were down in the hotels near 
Tiananmen Square. So I did not want to go down to

15:58.039 --> 16:02.165
that part of the city. So I told them that on Monday 
morning, they would open at 9 o'clock, and then I

16:02.185 --> 16:11.920
would be over there, you know, when they opened, be 
one of the first people there, and see if I could get

16:02.185 --> 16:11.920
out early. You know, if I couldn't, that... I felt 
that I was safe enough or that I knew of where I

16:15.440 --> 16:24.248
could, you know, places to hide, stuff like that, 
that I would just wait, you know, get out on the

16:15.440 --> 16:24.248
following Sunday. But to have instructed her to 
call me back around noon on Monday, Beijing time,

16:25.129 --> 16:38.662
because that way hopefully I would have 
information to be able to tell her what

16:25.129 --> 16:38.662
arrangements, if any, I'd been able to make. So, 
the Sunday I continued to watch CNN, and they were

16:43.942 --> 16:48.287
beginning to get more coverage and pictures of 
what was going on. And I said, I knew that what we're

16:49.128 --> 17:01.103
dealing here with was a desperate government that 
was acting in a very desperate way to maintain its

16:49.128 --> 17:01.103
power. So before that, I felt that I could probably 
judge and predict what was going to happen

17:01.123 --> 17:11.315
sufficiently ahead of time to be able to get out of 
any danger. But here, you were acting You were

17:12.545 --> 17:18.233
dealing with people who were completely 
irrational, illogical. And the troops were, even

17:19.375 --> 17:33.635
though I, by watching CNN, knew where the main 
concentrations of what was going on, where they

17:19.375 --> 17:33.635
were, they still had patrols that were going 
around the city. And those patrols, if they saw a

17:34.396 --> 17:40.785
group of people, they might decide to just open up 
and start shooting at them. So I knew it was not safe

17:40.825 --> 17:42.467
to Too much traveling around the city. As a matter 
of fact, my plans originally, I was supposed to,

17:45.606 --> 17:57.577
one Sunday afternoon, I was supposed to change 
hotels and go over to the west side of town and stay

17:45.606 --> 17:57.577
in the place where we had lived before. And that's 
where our kids were going to stay with me. That was

18:02.182 --> 18:03.203
the Friendship Hotel? The Friendship Hotel. But 
realized that that's also where Beijing

18:04.684 --> 18:11.290
University and People's University and a lot of 
universities are. And that the military, once

18:11.658 --> 18:20.830
they got things under control in Tiananmen 
Square, that they were going to head for the

18:11.658 --> 18:20.830
university. So I made arrangements to go ahead and 
continue on in the hotel, in the Canoon Hotel,

18:20.910 --> 18:27.939
where I was. I ventured out a couple of times, just a 
little bit, right around the hotel there. There

18:36.450 --> 18:39.454
was very little traffic. on what's normally going 
on on Sunday. But you begin to see some people kind

18:43.213 --> 18:53.268
of clustered together in small groups, I think, 
passing on information about what was going on

18:43.213 --> 18:53.268
down in Tiananmen Square. Again, the government 
controls all the news media, and of course they

18:53.809 --> 18:59.677
weren't admitting what was going on. The only way 
people knew was by word of mouth and people

19:00.779 --> 19:09.812
spreading the word, not getting it in 
conventional ways by seeing what's going on in

19:00.779 --> 19:09.812
television news. or what have you. And I also 
realized that from our previous day that

19:13.507 --> 19:27.545
contacting our embassy and asking for their help 
to get out of there was a waste of my time because

19:13.507 --> 19:27.545
those people, they don't know what's going on. And 
my suspicions were confirmed both by my own

19:27.585 --> 19:33.792
personal experience. When I did get out, I met some 
people who as late as Monday afternoon our embassy

19:40.201 --> 19:46.349
was advising American tourists to continue to 
come to Beijing if there was no problem. Okay, so

19:46.770 --> 19:50.615
the embassy is not something you tried to contact. 
No. You're still then in contact in trying to get

19:51.035 --> 19:56.823
this flight out to Hong Kong. I went to sleep that 
night. I watched TV on and off. And then Monday

20:03.591 --> 20:09.499
morning, got up, ate a good breakfast, and went 
over to the Great Wall Sheraton Hotel. and was one

20:09.968 --> 20:13.892
of the first there to get in line. I think that 
because of my having been there before, I was one of

20:14.092 --> 20:23.903
the few foreigners that realized the seriousness 
of the situation. It wasn't until late Tuesday or

20:24.503 --> 20:34.073
Wednesday that the other Americans and tourists 
in that realized how dangerous the situation was

20:24.503 --> 20:34.073
and tried to get out. So there was a group of 15 or 20 
of us there who most of them were people who were

20:40.090 --> 20:52.503
working for corporations and that who had been in 
Beijing for a number of months and lived there and

20:40.090 --> 20:52.503
they realized how serious the things were and were 
trying to get out. I couldn't get a flight out on

20:53.444 --> 20:56.888
Monday. The earliest one that I could get changed 
to was a flight that left early Tuesday morning.

21:03.015 --> 21:04.156
There were actually two flights. One went 
directly from Beijing to Hong Kong and the other

21:05.157 --> 21:09.642
one from Beijing to Tianjin which is a major port 
city in China. It's on the coast about 120 miles

21:13.930 --> 21:20.457
from Beijing. But it went from Beijing to Tianjin 
to Hong Kong. So I had the lady go ahead and change my

21:22.620 --> 21:26.745
ticket and put me on that flight. Now, I'm somewhat 
concerned because China does not have the tourist

21:27.406 --> 21:35.756
and travel facilities we have here. We just call 
them a travel agent. Through the computers, they

21:36.877 --> 21:39.240
can book flights and reservations anywhere you 
want. The Chinese still did not have round-trip

21:43.628 --> 21:45.570
tickets. They're just now beginning to get some of 
their major ticket offices hooked together by a

21:47.132 --> 21:52.859
computer. So even though this lady had on her 
computer, she had put it in, I wasn't sure, I wasn't

21:52.879 --> 22:03.372
comfortable that it had been confirmed out of the 
airport. Your skepticism grew a little bit out of

22:03.392 --> 22:07.497
your previous experiences with Reagan. Okay, 
China. So I went back to the hotel, and my wife was

22:09.055 --> 22:17.426
able to get through until about 12, 30, quarter to 
1. It was still easier for people from outside to

22:17.746 --> 22:24.094
call in than it was for us to call out. Did you try to 
call out? I had tried to call out once earlier, but I

22:25.836 --> 22:28.079
couldn't get a line. I couldn't get an outside 
line. So she got in, and I told her what my plans were

22:30.622 --> 22:37.611
and that, I was concerned about being able to get 
out to the airport because, as I said, it's outside

22:38.333 --> 22:42.859
of town. And there were very few buses that were 
running. There really weren't any buses that you

22:47.004 --> 22:50.068
could take directly out to the airport anyway. But 
there were also very few taxis. Usually at the

22:52.751 --> 22:55.495
hotels, there was one of 20 or 30 taxis. Sunday and 
Monday, I'd only seen two or three that had come by

22:56.797 --> 23:02.023
and were dropping people off. There weren't a lot 
of taxis out there. I didn't want to... alarm her

23:07.747 --> 23:24.826
too much, but I told her, you know, what I was going 
to do is I was just going to go ahead after I finished

23:07.747 --> 23:24.826
talking with her, and I was going to go out to the 
airport, you know, I'd sleep out there tonight, so

23:07.747 --> 23:24.826
that way I'd be out there, so in case the military 
decided they were going to close off the city or

23:07.747 --> 23:24.826
something, you know, that I'd at least be outside 
the city. And I assured her that, you know, I knew my

23:25.807 --> 23:33.195
way around, and she felt comfortable with that 
because we lived there. She knew by watching

23:33.856 --> 23:37.720
television back here what was going on you know, 
where the troops were, where the action was, and,

23:37.936 --> 23:47.227
you know, that I had some friends there, and that, 
you know, I had a good chance of being able to take

23:37.936 --> 23:47.227
care of myself. And both of us, I think, as we look 
back, felt unusually comfortable. Wasn't really

23:57.359 --> 24:03.366
scared or too worried at that point in time. We both 
feel that... that the Lord was with us and was... I

24:10.416 --> 24:12.518
could have very easily been down in Tiananmen 
Square. I could have run into troops that were

24:12.618 --> 24:24.890
shooting at me and felt comfortable in that sense, 
that it felt like the Lord was taking care of me as I

24:12.618 --> 24:24.890
was going through all this. So after I finished 
talking with her, I went downstairs and ate a big

24:26.191 --> 24:35.179
meal at the hotel because I didn't know when I'd get 
my next one. They also had a small grocery store

24:35.564 --> 24:40.289
there in the hotel. I went in there and bought a 
couple of canned hams, some bottled water, some

24:40.329 --> 24:50.278
Vienna sausage type things, and some crackers, 
and some bread type stuff. And then went up to my

24:50.298 --> 24:56.745
room and rearranged my stuff. I had a light

24:56.765 --> 25:05.453
bag that

24:56.765 --> 25:05.453
I put that I could carry very easily. I put some of 
the food in there and some of the things that I felt

25:07.746 --> 25:17.655
were more necessities in my bigger, hard-sided 
bag. I put things that I could do without if I had to

25:18.155 --> 25:23.079
ditch that. And I

25:23.900 --> 25:36.030
went to the desk and changed some of my money into

25:36.837 --> 25:38.358
dollars, got some dollars. You have to convert 
into foreign exchange. I got some of that. I had

25:42.823 --> 25:49.109
some Chinese local currency, and I also had some 
dollars. And I spread those around on my body and in

25:49.129 --> 25:59.819
my different bags so that if I was separated from 
one of them, I wouldn't have all my eggs in one

25:49.129 --> 25:59.819
basket, so to speak. And I brought along a Swiss 
Army knife because that's helpful in the as we

26:06.301 --> 26:10.825
found out before, and fortunately had that with 
me, so I put that in my pocket. And then went down and

26:11.766 --> 26:34.148
waited for a cab, and fortunately, about half an 
hour after I got out there, somebody was coming to,

26:11.766 --> 26:34.148
because tourists, American tourists, were still 
arriving Monday afternoon, and I talked back and

26:11.766 --> 26:34.148
had to bargain with this guy again, but got him to 
take me out to the airport, I was somewhat

26:35.208 --> 26:39.212
concerned because normally there's just a taxi 
driver. But in this cab, there was a taxi driver.

26:42.115 --> 26:45.919
There was a friend of his also sitting in the front 
seat. And I was concerned that these guys might try

26:45.939 --> 26:56.609
to rob me or they might take me out somewhere and 
leave me off there. But it was the only cab that had

26:57.110 --> 26:59.032
come around. So I figured I'd go ahead and take a 
chance. And so I got in the back seat. I let him put

27:06.494 --> 27:13.403
the heavy bag in the trunk, but I kept the other kind 
of carry-on bag type thing with me. And I had my

27:14.304 --> 27:16.668
pocket knife. That would have done me, I don't 
know, but easily accessible to me. And we got into

27:22.395 --> 27:25.199
the cab and we started going out there. And the 
driver knew a little bit of English and started a

27:26.100 --> 27:33.090
little bit of a conversation. And he had... a copy 
of a fax that they had received earlier in the day

27:36.380 --> 27:43.687
from Hong Kong. What the students and the people in 
Beijing were doing was they were getting most of

27:43.908 --> 27:52.036
their information from outside China, from Hong 
Kong. And what they would do was in Hong Kong, they

27:52.056 --> 28:01.526
would watch what was going on from the news and from 
their contacts, the people that they knew, and

27:52.056 --> 28:01.526
then they would write it out in Chinese 
characters. Then they would fax it to Beijing, and

28:01.546 --> 28:04.969
then people are sympathetic to the 
demonstrations. They would take them, and they

28:07.755 --> 28:12.460
would run off copies, which is very difficult to 
get access to a copy machine in China. It's not like

28:12.480 --> 28:17.044
here, where you just run down to Kiko's or 
someplace, four cents a copy place. And they would

28:17.985 --> 28:23.910
make copies, and then they would, as I mentioned, 
the students were distributing these, putting

28:17.985 --> 28:23.910
them on light poles and stuff like that. But this 
guy had a stack of them, and he gave me one of them,

28:24.531 --> 28:30.716
which I've had translated since I came back. And it 
was dealing with the massacre that's going on

28:35.020 --> 28:36.262
Saturday night, Sunday morning. It was square, 
what was going on, Tiananmen Square. And as we were

28:40.648 --> 28:49.400
going, I knew, again, because I'd been there, I 
knew the general streets and the general

28:40.648 --> 28:49.400
directions. So I was watching very carefully as to 
where these guys were taking me, so that I could

28:49.420 --> 28:54.428
tell if they were taking me or not. But they were 
going the route that you would go to get out there.

29:00.176 --> 29:04.622
And on two occasions, we passed a major 
intersection where there were several trucks of

29:05.041 --> 29:08.685
troops over on the side. And they were armed, but 
they weren't out there blocking off the street or

29:09.586 --> 29:13.770
that. They were just kind of camped over to the 
side. Well, the second group that we came up to was

29:19.356 --> 29:32.230
at the intersection of the road that goes out to the 
airport.

29:33.644 --> 29:59.517
lido the holiday inn is located right there on that 
intersection there were about four trucks they

29:33.644 --> 29:59.517
were there the troops they were out they were they 
were eating and mulling around and the driver as we

29:33.644 --> 29:59.517
started to go on this intersection he started 
rolling down his window and grabbed one of these

29:33.644 --> 29:59.517
faxes to give these soldiers and i thought you know 
this guy is going to get us killed right here and I

30:00.323 --> 30:09.472
was glad that his friend was in the front seat with 
him because his friend kind of, you know, nudged

30:00.323 --> 30:09.472
him on the arm and, you know, shook his head, you 
know, don't do this. And so he turned all over on the

30:10.113 --> 30:19.222
seat next to us so that even somebody looking in 
couldn't see him and rolled the window back up and

30:10.113 --> 30:19.222
we drove on. And it was great news with that. We got 
out to the airport. It was about 4 o'clock in the

30:26.189 --> 30:29.132
afternoon. And one time I see the

30:30.479 --> 30:39.657
United Airlines flight that my kids were supposed 
to come in. It was supposed to get into Beijing

30:39.677 --> 30:42.181
Monday night. And what it does is it's coming and 
going.
