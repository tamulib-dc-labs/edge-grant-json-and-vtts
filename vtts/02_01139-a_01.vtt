WEBVTT

00:01.752 --> 00:03.155
paralysis to the lower jaw. That was the only 
symptom he had. I buried him, and that night my

00:05.118 --> 00:13.194
brother, who was in Baylor Med School, came home 
from college, and we told him about the dog. He dug

00:14.076 --> 00:21.550
the dog up, sent the head to Austin for 
examination, and proved that he had rabies. So my

00:21.952 --> 00:30.067
father and my neighbor and I and my brother all had 
to take the Pasteur treatment, which consisted of

00:21.952 --> 00:30.067
25 doses. You've been through this? Yes, I've been 
through it when I was a child. And then during the

00:34.495 --> 00:44.372
rabies epidemic here in the cattle, I took the 
vaccine at least once a year for three years just to

00:34.495 --> 00:44.372
keep myself immunized. If you have rabies, you 
die. Now, tell me about the past year treatment

00:47.365 --> 00:51.295
that you're talking about for rabies in humans. 
It's a series of 25 doses you said. Well, I don't

00:55.526 --> 01:03.265
remember if it was 20 or 25, but it seemed like 25 the 
first time I took it. But it's been perfected now

01:04.882 --> 01:09.788
and people can be immunized. Most veterinarians 
take a dose of rabies vaccine annually just to keep

01:09.868 --> 01:16.777
them immunized. But if you get bit by an animal that 
has rabies, then you have to take a series of

01:16.797 --> 01:27.470
vaccines hoping that you will be protected and not 
die. I lost a classmate who graduated when I did He

01:31.443 --> 01:39.235
was bitten by a dog back in the 1940s, and even 
though he took the treatment, he developed rabies

01:31.443 --> 01:39.235
and died. So I've always had a respect for it. Yes, 
you hear that the vaccines are administered, you

01:41.939 --> 01:50.852
know, I don't know whether this is true or not, in 
the stomach. Is that true? No, they're

01:52.071 --> 01:55.776
administered in the muscle of the abdomen. Muscle 
of the abdomen. Abdominal muscle. Okay. People

01:58.200 --> 02:03.987
get mixed up when they're talking about the 
stomach and the abdominal muscles. They use a

02:04.348 --> 02:08.173
short needle going into the muscle of the abdomen. 
And you've had these treatments? And you can take

02:09.174 --> 02:10.777
them in your arms. I took them in my arms usually 
after I became an adult. Mm-hmm. but uh... so

02:16.752 --> 02:22.712
you've been through this so-called painful 
treatment of rabies as young as eight years old Oh,

02:22.912 --> 02:23.493
yes. Eight or ten. I can't remember exactly when it 
was, but I was a child. But I was interested in

02:27.877 --> 02:31.080
treating all the sick animals in the 
neighborhood. The type of rabies you just

02:32.061 --> 02:41.369
described, as early as you say, was called dumb 
rabies, where the paralysis of the lower jaw, the

02:32.061 --> 02:41.369
jaw fell down, the tongue hung out. But there's 
also the other type of rabies that everybody

02:41.770 --> 02:46.494
recognizes, the foaming of the mouth. And leaving 
home. Roaming. The most dangerous type of rabies

02:50.823 --> 02:55.369
is the dumb rabies because people don't recognize 
it. If a cow has dumb rabies, she just stands around

02:56.030 --> 03:12.133
and slobbers and drools saliva and people think 
she has a corncob hung across the roof of her mouth

02:56.030 --> 03:12.133
and they examine her and expose themselves. That 
happened to one man and he had to take the rabies

03:12.413 --> 03:17.961
shots and it made him sick. Physically sick. He had 
to be in bed for a month or two. I knew two people in

03:21.341 --> 03:25.267
Henderson who had that problem. Some people do 
have reactions to the vaccine, but 99% of them

03:26.068 --> 03:32.918
fully recover after a month or two. So you still 
need to take the vaccine if you expose yourself.

03:36.503 --> 03:38.366
Right. Okay, so that's something I've learned 
about rabies this morning, no doubt about that.

03:43.233 --> 03:46.077
May I mention oak buds and acorn poisoning? Do we 
have time? Sure. That is something that we still

03:48.569 --> 03:50.451
see. Oak buds poison cattle, especially in early 
spring. If you're not feeding them enough and they

03:56.439 --> 03:59.844
start eating oak buds. I saw the first herd 
affected. Again, it was Ralph Ballinger's caves

04:04.129 --> 04:08.235
out north of Henderson. I've also seen people cut 
timber in spring and summer and the cattle have...

04:17.712 --> 04:25.082
perhaps not quite as much grass as they want, so 
they go out there and eat all of the oak leaves on

04:17.712 --> 04:25.082
these trees. And they can get down and die. Mary 
Kelly lost four or five cows one year when she was

04:27.205 --> 04:33.033
selling oak timber. So you must be careful that you 
don't let your cattle eat too many oak leaves Oak

04:39.835 --> 04:43.619
buds in the spring are too many acorns. In the fall 
of the year, if you turn your cattle into a pasture

04:43.999 --> 04:54.030
with a lot of acorns on the ground and they get 
started eating them, it seems like that they like

04:43.999 --> 04:54.030
acorns. And if you don't feed them hay and get them 
off of those acorns, if they stay in a woods pasture

04:54.931 --> 05:04.241
and eat too many acorns for a week, you can lose 
them. I saw that happen to several people. So

05:07.645 --> 05:10.636
that's something that is ever-present danger. 
Right. If you could, I know that veterinary

05:12.000 --> 05:19.005
medicine has sort of a lot of things... pre-World 
War II era and a post-World War II era, and that came

05:19.812 --> 05:36.157
with the advent of the A&M Medical School, which 
had its first graduates in 1920 and, of course, was

05:19.812 --> 05:36.157
in the war a short 20 years later. What about some of 
the remedies that were used before the war and

05:36.838 --> 05:45.752
after the war since there'd been a lot of, I'm sure, 
test run and research done? some of the favorite

05:46.171 --> 06:12.060
old remedies that many of us remember being used 
when we were children and up until the world war two

05:46.171 --> 06:12.060
era we might say were for hollow tail which was now 
these remedies were used in cattle hollow tail was

05:46.171 --> 06:12.060
a common uh... condition that was being diagnosed 
by people who didn't know what was wrong with the

06:12.361 --> 06:14.063
cow. They knew that she was down and couldn't get 
up. She was paralyzed. They would feel of her tail,

06:18.008 --> 06:23.754
find a soft spot due to a deficiency, and call it 
hollow tail. They would split the tail and put

06:24.675 --> 06:29.421
something like salt and pepper or turpentine on 
it. Then, of course, if they treated the cow

06:30.342 --> 06:36.689
properly with enough food and water, a few of them 
would live. Another very common thing in treating

06:37.670 --> 06:40.714
a cow with mineral deficiency we call milk fever 
was seen when a cow would have a calf and sometime

06:41.302 --> 07:07.275
maybe in 48 hours she would become down and unable 
to walk and go into a coma those cattle were

06:41.302 --> 07:07.275
commonly referred to as having milk fever even 
though they didn't have any fever the temperature

06:41.302 --> 07:07.275
would be below normal it was a misnomer and before 
the days of graduate veterinarians who injected

07:07.762 --> 07:20.027
calcium gluconate solution into the vein to make 
the cow overcome the disease and get up and start

07:07.762 --> 07:20.027
walking off in 10 or 15 minutes. The common 
treatment was pumping air into their udder. And,

07:25.075 --> 07:39.388
of course, it would work because it would make the 
cow quit producing milk, and she would gradually

07:25.075 --> 07:39.388
get better, and most of them would survive but end 
up with a case of mastitis, infection up in the

07:25.075 --> 07:39.388
quarters. And the loss of the cud, as people called 
it, when a cow got sick and quit chewing her cud, as

07:40.297 --> 07:59.707
most sick cows do, some people thought they would 
have to take an old dish rag and poke it down their

07:40.297 --> 07:59.707
throat to give them another cud, which, of course, 
some cows would die from that treatment. Sounds

07:59.727 --> 08:00.468
like it. And I saw many cows that were being treated 
with with mistletoe that was being fed to them due

08:04.462 --> 08:12.660
to the cow that was retaining her afterbirth more 
than two or three days. And of course they would get

08:13.501 --> 08:17.550
word and they'd start feeding her mistletoe. What 
would the mistletoe do? Would it help? No, the

08:21.353 --> 08:23.155
mistletoe wouldn't help. But if the cow didn't get 
an infection and die, and she passed the placenta

08:23.576 --> 08:34.709
or afterbirth in five or six days, then the 
mistletoe would get credit for curing her. So it's

08:34.729 --> 08:36.932
just luck if it happened, huh? Yes. You just would 
have been feeding them anything, huh? Anything.

08:40.356 --> 08:43.480
And most of them will, of course, if you're lucky. 
survive, but they don't all pass their afterbirth

08:43.460 --> 08:48.225
in 48 hours. It depends on the nutrition that the 
cow's receiving as much as anything. Then on

08:51.989 --> 09:09.028
horses and mules, a very common thing that we saw 
was colic, commonly called blocked kidneys, and

08:51.989 --> 09:09.028
people were commonly using turpentine or 
kerosene and a saucer held to the navel of the cow,

08:51.989 --> 09:09.028
and if that the horse or mule. If it would be 
absorbed then they thought it would probably work

09:11.765 --> 09:26.431
and it would work in the fact that you'd get up and 
start leading the horse around and those that had

09:11.765 --> 09:26.431
gas colic would start passing the gas and recover. 
Then there were several other things that were

09:27.513 --> 09:33.885
being used for worms in horses If they looked 
wormy, they'd feed them a plug of tobacco. And that

09:36.775 --> 09:39.679
did kill a few of the worms. Blind stagers, which 
was the common name for sleeping sickness or

09:40.320 --> 09:51.095
encephalomyelitis, people would split the skin 
on the forehead and insert a dime. And of course, I

09:51.796 --> 09:56.002
don't think any of them ever lived, but they would 
get treated. Then fistula of the withers, which

09:57.244 --> 10:02.151
was a disease that some of us remember. and still 
see one occasionally. They would drain the

10:04.699 --> 10:16.518
abscess, which occurred on the upper part of the 
shoulder blade, drain the abscess, and insert

10:04.699 --> 10:16.518
several coins to help keep it draining. Fish of the 
weathers, of course, could be treated in other

10:17.379 --> 10:23.148
ways, and we cured some of them. But it was always a 
long, drawn-out treatment. And the dogs that

10:27.755 --> 10:30.079
would have distemper The most common treatment 
was to soak three or four small corn cobs in a

10:30.785 --> 10:43.063
mixture of Vicksave and turpentine and string it 
on a wire or a cord and use it as a collar on these

10:30.785 --> 10:43.063
dogs. Of course, some dogs with distemper always 
recover, regardless of what you do, if they don't

10:43.564 --> 10:51.696
develop pneumonia or encephalitis. These were 
some of the treatments that were sort of homespun,

10:52.013 --> 11:03.082
I guess you would call it, and you can't give much 
credit to, I guess, any one of them as being

10:52.013 --> 11:03.082
particularly helpful. Kind of nature took its 
course one way or the other, but I guess human

11:03.603 --> 11:08.567
beings had to act in some way or another, didn't 
they? But what are some of the big changes you've

11:09.228 --> 11:16.114
seen in the veterinary medicine since World War 
II? Since World War II, the changes that I have

11:17.995 --> 11:21.278
noticed... would be the building of modern 
veterinary hospitals for treating and

11:22.287 --> 11:48.801
hospitalizing animals in most counties of Texas, 
bone surgery for fractures in pets and domestic

11:22.287 --> 11:48.801
livestock, abdominal surgery such as 
C-sections, tumor surgery, and surgery for

11:22.287 --> 11:48.801
horses that have colic with twisted intestines, 
x-rays, are commonly used now in the diagnosis of

11:49.203 --> 11:53.429
diseases in animals. And very extensive 
laboratory tests are made to diagnose and treat

11:54.491 --> 11:59.799
animals. And in some areas you have embryo 
transplants in cattle and horses, which is a big

12:00.740 --> 12:06.489
business. There they take the embryo from the 
valuable registered animal and transplant it

12:07.250 --> 12:15.582
into the non-registered sheep cow or horse, mare, 
and grow the registered coat. The surgery for

12:23.837 --> 12:28.706
herniated discs in vertebrae of dogs and cats is 
very common. The new vaccines and new drugs for

12:29.628 --> 12:37.722
preventing and treating diseases that are 
available is a revolutionary change. You've seen

12:38.782 --> 12:45.152
a lot of them happen and experienced most of the 
diseases, I guess, here in Russ County. What are

12:45.593 --> 12:52.604
some of the diseases that were taken care of by 
veterinary medicine over the years that we don't

12:45.593 --> 12:52.604
have a problem with now? Well, the most common 
diseases that I recall being eradicated

12:53.065 --> 13:02.501
completely would be the Texas tick fever by 
dipping the cattle. And that was eradicated in the

13:03.783 --> 13:05.886
30s. hoof and mouth disease by slaughtering all 
the infected herds. When I moved here in 47, a

13:12.788 --> 13:23.624
veterinarian who had been ahead of me left 
Henderson and went to Mexico to help the Mexican

13:12.788 --> 13:23.624
government. The hog cholera, which all of our 
older people remember was so common, has been

13:25.226 --> 13:32.878
completely eradicated. The loin disease and 
creeps that we mentioned earlier, by using

13:37.287 --> 13:42.234
minerals in their feeds, has been eradicated. The 
X disease that we mentioned has been eradicated.

13:46.460 --> 13:52.869
Vesicular exanthema in swine was a disease that 
caused ulcers on the nose and mouth of hogs. I only

13:52.969 --> 13:54.211
saw one case. I was called by a man who had bought a 
hog at the auction barn, and after he bought her, he

13:55.112 --> 14:00.780
noticed it. He carried her onto his farm, even 
though I told him that it looked like it might be

14:01.958 --> 14:12.032
vesicular exanthema, a new disease that had just 
been described in the newspapers. Well, he took

14:13.073 --> 14:15.737
her onto his farm and exposed his herd. And then two 
weeks later, he called me and told me what he had

14:16.498 --> 14:20.423
done. And we had to call the state veterinarian who 
came up here and killed most of his hogs to

14:21.449 --> 14:40.318
eradicate the vesicular exanthema, which is 
similar in clinical symptoms, similar to the foot

14:21.449 --> 14:40.318
and mouth disease or hoof and mouth disease in 
cattle, which was eradicated. Our guest this

14:40.822 --> 14:49.757
morning, Dr. Hugh M. Phillips, retired doctor of 
veterinary medicine practice, 38 years here in

14:40.822 --> 14:49.757
Henderson from 1947 until 1985. And as I said, 
we've been running over on the roadshow a little

14:51.199 --> 15:06.424
bit this morning, but my goodness, we've got Dr. 
Phillips here, and we're taping this for the book

14:51.199 --> 15:06.424
that's going to be coming out, and the title of the 
book will be The History of Veterinary Medicine

14:51.199 --> 15:06.424
Today. in Texas, and we've covered it statewide. 
We've also covered it countywide and how Dr.

15:11.008 --> 15:17.494
Phillips came to be here and he and his family in the 
Henderson area. We've, of course, gotten some

15:17.995 --> 15:29.485
phone calls over the past hour and 20 minutes or so, 
which I'm sure that you'll be able to refer to these

15:17.995 --> 15:29.485
Dr. Phillips from Henderson and Russ County, 
people involved in A&M. Mr. Milner, who was

15:29.965 --> 15:35.010
president, you might want to address that in just a 
minute. Well, Mr. Milner, of course, was one of the

15:35.362 --> 15:58.210
presidents, and he not only lived on the A&M 
campus, and I lived in a dormitory called Milner

15:35.362 --> 15:58.210
Dorm one year, but he lived here in Henderson in 
what we used to call the Milner Addition out where

15:35.362 --> 15:58.210
the Baptist College is now located. We also had Mr. 
Gathright, who was a president of A&M. He's buried

16:03.296 --> 16:04.057
here. Milner And Gathrider both buried here in the 
Old City Cemetery. Okay. And let's see, there's a

16:09.913 --> 16:14.660
teacher down at A&M from the area, I believe, Mr. 
Anderson? Dr. Anderson. Right. Dr. Jim Anderson,

16:16.603 --> 16:28.500
the son of Mr. Gilbert Anderson, who used to be the 
Three Bell Brothers manager, is one of our best

16:16.603 --> 16:28.500
teachers at A&M in the Department of Physiology. 
He's still there, right? He's still there. I

16:30.163 --> 16:33.668
visited with him about a month ago when I was at A&M. 
Any other Rusconians or East Texans you recall

16:33.648 --> 16:40.979
involved in the vet college? Well, we had one 
veterinarian here who stayed about two months.

16:47.268 --> 16:52.235
And Dr. James Denton, he also rented the building 
from Mr. Brown. And he was ahead of me, immediately

16:52.836 --> 16:56.541
ahead of me. I followed him. He fell in love with a 
girl from Dallas. and decided to get married, and

17:03.652 --> 17:09.337
they moved out to Cisco, Texas, and had three 
little boys. And Cisco was nothing to compare to

17:10.719 --> 17:16.644
Henderson in size or in industry. So after being 
there and having three little boys and getting

17:17.285 --> 17:26.134
hungry, he moved and went down to teach at A&M. He 
became an excellent teacher in large animal

17:26.194 --> 17:31.819
clinics at A&M. And I've teased him many times 
about leaving Henderson and going to Cisco out

17:32.525 --> 17:39.033
west Texas. Right, I believe it's this side 
Abilene. Yes. I don't know why he chose Cisco. I've

17:44.601 --> 17:45.181
forgotten. Over there by Eastland and in that 
area. Yeah, that's way out there. Well, Dr.

17:50.028 --> 17:57.838
Phillips, we've covered a lot this morning, the 
history of veterinary medicine in Texas, also

17:50.028 --> 17:57.838
history of veterinary medicine in Russ County. 
Any other things that come to mind right now while

17:58.639 --> 18:02.464
we're here? Something interesting I wanted to 
mention is a conversation I had with Mr. Pete

18:02.630 --> 18:07.275
Smith. And at that time, he told me that his 
brother, Virgil Smith, was one of the tick

18:08.257 --> 18:14.945
inspectors. And back in the early 1930s, Virgil 
Smith, most of you remember, owned Auction Barn,

18:15.966 --> 18:29.802
was one of the owners, was working for the state as a 
tick inspector. they were making seventy five

18:30.187 --> 18:44.365
dollars a month furnishing his own horse also 
uh... mister gordon brown who was sheriff here in

18:30.187 --> 18:44.365
the early fifties was a tick inspector and of 
course Back in those days, a lot of the people

18:44.851 --> 18:49.037
didn't want to dip their cattle. A few of them 
refused, and they would have to be forced by the

18:49.238 --> 18:55.026
sheriff to dip their cattle. And Shelby County and 
Houston County were noted for having more

18:55.507 --> 19:01.196
trouble. One man was killed in Shelby County, and I 
remember Pete Smith told me that his brother,

19:01.977 --> 19:13.474
Virgil Smith, when he was transferred from here to 
Houston County, Down there they let him carry a

19:13.707 --> 19:21.779
pistol with him for protection because many of the 
people decided they would not dip the old milk cow.

19:23.161 --> 19:30.232
People get attached to the old boss, you know, 
bossy or whatever they called her, and didn't want

19:23.161 --> 19:30.232
her dipped. So in order to eradicate the ticks and 
the disease, People were forced to dip their

19:34.514 --> 19:37.621
cattle, whether they wanted to or not. I thought 
that would be interesting. Some of the people who

19:40.207 --> 19:43.895
worked as tick inspectors that we know. Turned out 
to be a dangerous job in one case there. It did. Dr.

19:48.790 --> 19:53.400
Hugh M. Phillips, our guest this morning, retired 
doctor of veterinary medicine. And let's see,

19:53.500 --> 19:58.951
you, I was trying to go back through my notes here. 
You graduated what year from the veterinary, 43?

20:02.238 --> 20:05.205
1943, I went into the Army. Okay. Okay. So you 
practiced until 1985 and practiced here in

20:07.218 --> 20:14.509
Henderson for 38 years since 1947. Gosh, we've had 
a marathon this morning, but I believe this was

20:14.629 --> 20:33.057
very necessary in the recording of the research 
you've done, not only for the state of Texas as a

20:14.629 --> 20:33.057
whole, but for our East Texas area and experience 
from your 38-year career here in Russ County. Dr.

20:33.037 --> 20:40.748
Phillips, we again appreciate you very much this 
morning putting up with us and going through this

20:33.037 --> 20:40.748
entire history with us. We appreciate it. Thank 
you, Chipper. Veterinary medicine is close to my

20:42.771 --> 20:48.900
heart, and I enjoy doing anything that helps 
people. Right. Thank you very much, sir. Okay,

20:51.824 --> 20:54.047
that's going to be it for the road show this 
morning. We do have a full week for you for the rest

20:54.928 --> 20:59.014
of the week, too. Let me remind you that tomorrow 
morning we're going to be talking with the Noon

20:59.255 --> 21:02.419
Lion.
