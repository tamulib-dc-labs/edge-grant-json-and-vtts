WEBVTT

00:02.461 --> 00:05.224
When did you, when and where did you go back to 
school? Okay, I came back in April 46, discharged

00:05.244 --> 00:23.286
at Camp Atterbury, 10

00:05.244 --> 00:23.286
miles from Franklin, Indiana, where my mother and 
father had lived at one time, and I was related to

00:05.244 --> 00:23.286
about a third of the county. I came back and decided 
to go back and finish my dissertation on G.I. Bill.

00:31.156 --> 00:32.097
This was the It paid my expenses, and what was it, 
$80 or $90 a month, and all my dissertation costs,

00:32.633 --> 00:43.687
et cetera, et cetera. And

00:44.849 --> 01:00.970
you don't get much leave while war is going on, so I 
had almost three months of leave to accumulate and

00:44.849 --> 01:00.970
got a certain amount of cash. I'd finished my 
dissertation. It worked out fine.

01:12.184 --> 01:25.238
But when I finished it, I was the second PhD in 
Chicago from

01:12.184 --> 01:25.238
about 1942 to finish. Everybody had gone in. So I 
had a doctoral thing. you know, your doctoral

01:31.257 --> 01:33.299
committee normally. I had my

01:34.300 --> 01:44.249
sitting in my, everybody wanted to sit in on a 
doctoral exam. Nobody had been in one except Al

01:44.469 --> 01:53.037
Summitt who had preceded me, who's been president 
of Southern Illinois later. Here are the people

01:53.097 --> 02:00.184
who, I made a list once of who was on my 
dissertation. board and sat and why they passed me

02:00.350 --> 02:02.934
I'll never know. Leonard White, Herman 
Pritchett, Walter Johnson, head of the history

02:03.434 --> 02:30.171
department, Morton Grodson, then head of 
political science, Don Price, Albert Lepofsky,

02:03.434 --> 02:30.171
head of the Finance Officers Association, James 
Mitchell, later civil service commissioner,

02:03.434 --> 02:30.171
Jerome Kerwin, political theory, Charles 
Harden, Avery Leiserson, Hans Morgenthau,

02:31.180 --> 02:38.568
Lindsay Wright, and Alfred Cobbett. Oh, my. That 
was a who's who. Oh, dear. And I'd been away from

02:41.871 --> 02:44.614
school for five years. So I always think of one. 
Cobbett asked me, I'd lived in France, would I care

02:49.539 --> 02:56.746
to comment on the experience of the French 
government after the war? I thought, oh, God. I

02:59.249 --> 03:00.310
said, no, I wouldn't. And I got away with it. They 
passed me, I think, by the... I could answer

03:06.567 --> 03:10.652
questions on the dissertation all right, but 
nobody read it. This crowd, they didn't have a clue

03:11.273 --> 03:15.798
about the history of the U.S. Civil Service. 
Leonard White did, but...

03:20.242 --> 03:23.746
So... At the first job, where was it? My first job, I 
interviewed at Princeton, Purdue,

03:23.926 --> 03:29.993
Northwestern, And everybody was looking for 
people, so there was a job. And I was offered most at

03:35.054 --> 03:41.099
Purdue, but I went to Northwestern. What was the 
first, that beginning size? 3,300. And what did

03:44.082 --> 03:46.464
that? It wasn't bad. That seemed like a pretty good 
sum, didn't it? Yeah. And this is as an instructor.

03:51.788 --> 03:53.970
They didn't do assistant professors yet. That 
took another 5, 10 years before a PhD could start as

03:54.010 --> 04:00.756
assistant professor.

04:02.575 --> 04:12.510
So I was made assistant professor two years later.

04:12.530 --> 04:20.742
Then I decided I wanted to get a bit of experience in 
the civil service. So I took the exam for

04:20.782 --> 04:23.807
management analyst and passed it. And 51 and 2, I 
spent as a GS-12 management analyst in the Office

04:25.120 --> 04:36.171
of the Comptroller of the Army as a civil servant. 
In Washington? In Washington. Doing studies of

04:39.214 --> 04:46.061
the supply operations in the military. And 
became, at the end, a section chief in the that when

04:54.955 --> 05:14.434
Ed Litchfield, who was General Secretary of 
Political Science, who had been and was, or had

04:54.955 --> 05:14.434
just come back from being head of the Civil 
Administration Division of German Military

04:54.955 --> 05:14.434
Government under General Clay. And Litchfield 
had just been appointed Dean of the new School of

05:15.655 --> 05:23.443
Business and Public Administration at Cornell.

05:26.225 --> 05:37.320
And

05:26.225 --> 05:37.320
I had done a program for Litchfield while I was at 
Northwestern. I had the first group of Germans

05:38.021 --> 05:44.150
into the United States for training in democracy.

05:48.356 --> 05:53.683
We had about a dozen state and local government 
officials. And I set up a program with the

05:54.237 --> 06:12.937
help of the public administration, 
clearinghouse people, Louis Brownlow and

05:54.237 --> 06:12.937
Herbert Emmerich, and some of the Chicago 
faculty. We had the program beginning lecture

06:12.957 --> 06:20.245
discussion part at the University of Chicago. And 
then we sent them out in the field. Three of them,

06:24.012 --> 06:30.722
they'd heard about that the Indian had been so 
badly treated. So I sent them up to the Cherokee

06:30.802 --> 06:38.914
Reservation in northern Wisconsin to see this 
terrible treatment they were getting. And so one

06:40.136 --> 06:47.867
of the greatest help to me was T.V. Smith. who had 
worked with Germans. And he clued me in on a, and I

06:54.948 --> 07:09.325
have a small volume that he did, which has never 
been published, I don't know why not, on kind of

06:54.948 --> 07:09.325
background. He said the problem that the Germans 
have to face is if

07:09.386 --> 07:19.898
you are right, How can you compromise? This is the 
problem in European politics for the most part.

07:27.528 --> 07:29.811
They speak of the French as being very logical. 
They're so goddamn logical they never can agree.

07:32.675 --> 07:36.720
And they said they're perfectly right. The ethics 
of compromise are a bit peculiar. So we faced that

07:44.397 --> 07:47.300
head on. TV had a book, and they said you can in fact

07:47.460 --> 08:01.796
do a great many things without coming up into 
ethical problems if you will do so. So I got two or

08:04.599 --> 08:14.269
three people in talking on that kind of problem.

08:14.755 --> 08:19.723
public service, the public administration task, 
then back to academics? Yes, I was on leave for a

08:20.524 --> 08:31.480
semester at Northwestern, then back to 
Northwestern, then to Washington, and then to

08:20.524 --> 08:31.480
Cornell. I came to Cornell the fall of 52 and was 
there for 18 years. Ed made me an offer of five-year

08:43.240 --> 08:48.127
term appointment as associate professor, and 
that looked fine to me. So I was making up lost time.

08:51.432 --> 08:59.865
And

08:51.432 --> 08:59.865
I got appointed full professor in 1958. Now, how

08:59.885 --> 09:09.079
did you and A&M link up?

09:11.523 --> 09:19.751
In 63,

09:11.523 --> 09:19.751
I became national general secretary of Beta Theta 
Pi. Our general secretary is a part-time

09:21.193 --> 09:24.676
official. We have a full-time person in the 
headquarters. We did it that way unusually. Most

09:30.943 --> 09:38.290
of the attorneys tended to fall in the hands of the 
full-time permanent secretary. Well, our chief

09:39.113 --> 09:55.653
administrative officer is a private citizen, 
part-time general secretary, and most of the work

09:39.113 --> 09:55.653
is done by volunteers rather than by full-time 
people. So I agreed to do that. I had the

09:57.095 --> 09:59.197
interesting situation. My president was Dean 
Malott, who was a Kansas Spatha. My dean was Bill

10:05.205 --> 10:07.888
Carmichael, who had married Owen D. Young's 
granddaughter, and Owen D. Young was a St.

10:08.864 --> 10:19.721
Lawrence beta, and Philip Young's daughter. He'd 
been dean of business in Columbia, and he was a

10:20.482 --> 10:24.388
beta. So my dean was not a beta, but his daughter, 
his wife. So I had my deans okay, and the presidents

10:30.237 --> 10:37.048
okay to do this. I still taught my courses, but I got 
some extra space and a secretary and so on. So I was

10:47.614 --> 10:51.379
general secretary at Bethlehem DePauw for a term. 
Well, in 64, fortunately,

10:52.481 --> 11:05.517
when I became that, I had agreed to be general 
secretary, other things, and pull out two terms,

10:52.481 --> 11:05.517
other things being equal. Well, I got engaged to 
Dorothy in 64 and I reported to the board, I'm

11:06.188 --> 11:13.275
sorry, things are no longer equal.

11:16.218 --> 11:19.441
So I have Dorothy and I have a 13 year old stepson. 
And so I finish that and end my work with beta theta

11:21.723 --> 11:33.394
pi for a while because As general secretary, I had 
to sit in a board meeting being presided over by my

11:34.859 --> 11:45.572
predecessor, who had been made president. And I 
figured, and who's a very able man, but with whom,

11:45.592 --> 11:58.227
very conservative, and I knew the fraternities 
had to expand. And I was all the time, in effect,

12:04.053 --> 12:21.994
trying to overturn his policies so I decided I will 
not be around while my successor is Joe Ramota who

12:04.053 --> 12:21.994
was dean of faculty at Saint Lawrence succeeded me 
and So I stayed out of fraternity affairs for quite

12:23.594 --> 12:33.748
a bit until we got a chapter here and I got involved 
and I was their advisor for about six, seven years.

12:37.854 --> 12:45.284
Well, that was running a large nonprofit 
organization, the Volunteers, is also an

12:37.854 --> 12:45.284
interesting experience.

12:48.349 --> 12:52.875
And

12:48.349 --> 12:52.875
so,

12:56.011 --> 12:59.055
We got my stepson through high school. He'd been 
moved enough. So we got him through Ithaca High

13:01.138 --> 13:09.248
School, and he was admitted into Syracuse. And he 
could have gotten in the College of Agriculture at

13:10.510 --> 13:16.517
Cornell, but that didn't much interest him.

13:19.822 --> 13:23.166
He didn't have quite good enough grades make the 
College of Liberal Arts.

13:32.495 --> 13:39.006
So, I decided eighteen winners, eighteen Ithaca 
winners is enough. I was quite happy at Cornell. I

13:43.133 --> 13:50.706
was getting a bit irked with the faculty who had, I 
think in 67 or 68, brought up

13:55.040 --> 13:58.385
This is military unrest in Vietnam. For about the 
fourth time brought up the question, do we allow

13:58.485 --> 14:02.311
the ROTC? And I thought, four times is enough of 
that.

14:09.161 --> 14:20.177
Cornell is heavily governed by its faculty, in 
distinction to a lot of institutions. So I began to

14:20.197 --> 14:22.701
look around. I had been out to Willamette to do a, 
they were interested in founding a school of

14:23.187 --> 14:31.638
business and public administration. And the 
Chicago Beta was on their board of trustees and

14:32.639 --> 14:38.566
knew my background in the Cornell. Would I come out 
and do a study for them? Was this feasible? And I

14:42.912 --> 14:52.063
talked to one of our Cornell professors who is now 
Dean of Business at Oregon. And so I knew I could get

14:52.415 --> 14:54.837
him. What are their plans? Well, they had no money 
to expand and weren't interested in expanding. So

14:59.782 --> 15:01.924
there wasn't going to be any. Portland was in no 
shape to do anything. So Willamette,

15:06.849 --> 15:14.095
being at the state capitol, was a natural for the PA 
part of it. And it looked like they would have no

15:14.316 --> 15:19.941
great competition in the business side. So I made a 
recommendation. And of course, I was asked if I

15:22.551 --> 15:26.497
wanted to be dean of that, which I declined. 
They're too far away. And besides Willamette was a

15:27.578 --> 15:33.227
teetotaling school and too many other. I didn't 
want to live that kind of life anyway. And I was a

15:38.214 --> 15:40.758
long way from Washington. So University of 
Georgia

15:41.940 --> 15:48.730
was interested in talking, and I interviewed for a 
dean of the college at Georgia Tech and came close.

16:01.416 --> 16:13.588
I was interviewed for residency of Colgate and 
Miami University, Oxford, Ohio, and was told in

16:01.416 --> 16:13.588
both places I was close. After that, things were 
looking messy, so in the university world I

16:16.570 --> 16:22.938
decided no more of this kind of look-see. So one of 
the professors at Georgia

16:24.320 --> 16:37.316
recommended me to the people looking here. So I got 
a letter from Texas A&M. Who was the letter from?

16:44.685 --> 16:46.307
Who was the real contact? The letter was from, oh, 
this is from Hubert's, Hubert's office or

16:48.430 --> 16:54.116
somewhere. And was it still Arts and Sciences, or 
was it just Liberal Arts then? Liberal Arts, yeah,

16:59.602 --> 17:02.404
as I remember. And his associate dean, I still see, 
McCandless.

17:12.255 --> 17:17.560
So I was invited down and brought Dorothy down with 
me. And as I began to see things and to see the

17:18.299 --> 17:28.872
colleges, most private schools and public 
schools were having financial problems by 1970.

17:30.433 --> 17:31.495
And A&M was not. And almost the weekend I came down 
to visit Ruddy had his stroke and died.

17:42.688 --> 17:46.973
So I am interviewed by Hubert. who is the dean of 
both education and liberal arts, and I think I'm

17:47.813 --> 17:57.008
about his last department head appointment. What 
was your, as you think back about that interview,

17:57.990 --> 18:05.182
describe the Hubert as an interviewer? Well, I 
wasn't interviewed much by Hubert. I was

18:09.369 --> 18:11.432
interviewed in the department. The department 
had been formed in 68, out of history, as you know.

18:19.341 --> 18:34.136
And

18:19.341 --> 18:34.136
William,

18:19.341 --> 18:34.136
well, he ought to remain nameless, had been there 
for a year from the Foreign Service. Yeah, I can't

18:35.117 --> 18:36.278
remember his name either. And I can give you the 
name, but in light of what I'm going to say, it's

18:36.499 --> 18:43.386
just as well we'll skip that. nice guy, Ph.D. 
Princeton out of the Foreign Service. And

18:49.494 --> 18:57.243
the problem was he didn't know anything about 
academia.

18:59.626 --> 19:09.897
Well, be that as it may, but my main interview was 
with the faculty, and I remember my—I'm

19:10.957 --> 19:15.303
And I decided, you know, one doesn't talk about 
one's dissertation.

19:17.886 --> 19:24.795
So I said, I'll open with a pronouncement, and then 
if you don't like it, don't hire me. This is the time

19:24.815 --> 19:32.866
when the behavioral and traditional are fighting 
in the social sciences, and particularly in

19:24.815 --> 19:32.866
political science. Cornell had been split over 
it. Berkeley was split over it. I said, I just want

19:38.277 --> 19:40.199
to comment on this. I said,

19:40.399 --> 19:51.251
as to this kind of fight, I want to make it clear. 
I've done a history than which you cannot be more

19:51.551 --> 19:57.638
traditional. Now, I said, I've also just finished 
with the sociologist Lloyd Warner the study of

19:57.658 --> 20:05.787
American federal executives. which is the 
largest questionnaire interview study

20:06.425 --> 20:10.871
anybody's ever done. And with 1,300,000

20:10.911 --> 20:20.544
pieces of data on punch cards and all the apparatus 
that goes with it. Now I said, it was very

20:21.345 --> 20:25.210
interesting to find that All of our propositions 
for which we used the punch card data to

20:26.607 --> 20:33.254
demonstrate, most of them came from the history.

20:36.197 --> 20:45.566
Now I said, I'm quite convinced you need both sides 
of this coin and I will raise hell with anybody who

20:36.197 --> 20:45.566
wants to make a fight about it. And so with that 
pronouncement, we had a very nice discussion and I

20:46.787 --> 20:52.513
was hired. I wrote Hubert. I said their salary is 
$1,000 or $2,000 too low, and he gave me another

20:55.542 --> 21:01.189
$1,000. All right, now this would be the last 
salary question. What was the beginning?

21:05.313 --> 21:06.895
$29,000. $29,000. Yeah.

21:11.501 --> 21:15.606
When you came to visit, you met with Hubert and the 
search committee. Anyone else? I'm trying to

21:17.328 --> 21:19.210
remember.

21:22.160 --> 21:22.440
Mr. Rudder was already... He's out of it. All 
right. I think I had a visit with... Byers as the

21:26.426 --> 21:33.275
chief academic officer?

21:37.561 --> 21:38.902
I don't think anybody... I visited anybody up 
there at that time. I think they were relying

21:43.248 --> 21:47.774
enough chaos in the operational on with 
Rudder's... Rudder's just died. Mm-hmm. And

21:51.117 --> 21:55.644
enough chaos that nobody, I think it's left to 
Hubert. What was your, for you and your wife, what

21:55.664 --> 22:03.034
were your impressions of A&M and of this 
community? Well, Dorothy thought, oh, God. She's

22:07.200 --> 22:08.021
from the east. And while she and I are first cousins 
once removed, she knows Indiana and all. brought

22:17.932 --> 22:23.138
up in Miami, Florida, which is East Coast Jewish, 
if anything. As she said, she walked along and

22:24.140 --> 22:29.646
people said hello to her. Her view of this howdy 
business was an invasion of privacy.

22:36.114 --> 22:41.521
So she wasn't so sure, but she was willing to do it. I 
came down a second time and took my life in my hands,

22:45.674 --> 22:51.702
and I bought, she hadn't seen it, the house across 
the street.

22:55.607 --> 22:58.812
I said, we're interested in old houses. They began 
to show me 30s and 40s and 50s. I said, haven't you

23:01.135 --> 23:03.798
got anything 19th century? Well, she said, there 
is one, but it might be on the market. The Wilson

23:10.307 --> 23:14.753
House, it's in an estate, it's about to be settled, 
and... I went in it, and the price was $20,000. I

23:21.883 --> 23:31.396
could have knocked down another five, I think, but 
I was so astonished because such things in Ithaca,

23:21.883 --> 23:31.396
they were already being snapped up. Texas is, you 
know, housing-wise, ten years behind. And

23:35.161 --> 23:40.468
$20,000, I thought, I can't believe it. This is 
intact. painted canvas walls, crystal

23:43.201 --> 23:49.988
chandeliers, lovely woodwork. It needs a little 
foundation work. It's pier and beamed, but

23:52.731 --> 23:59.578
everything's there, and 20,000, I can't believe 
it. So I'm in it 20 minutes and said, I'll take it.

24:04.503 --> 24:12.111
And I took my, as they say, my life in my hands 
because Dorothy liked it. But I'd bought it

24:12.749 --> 24:14.952
without her. Now, this is late spring 1970. This is 
late spring 1970. And so you all arrived when?

24:24.945 --> 24:36.701
Okay, part of my deal with Hubert was that there was 
no money for

24:24.945 --> 24:36.701
travel transportation down. So I got the... 
salary, half salary, all of my July salary. I

24:46.281 --> 24:52.390
didn't have to report till early August, but I got 
paid for July. And so we arrived in the early

24:52.410 --> 24:59.720
August. Did anyone give you any guidelines as to 
what they expected?

25:06.991 --> 25:07.832
Next to none. What dreams did anyone have for the 
department from any sort? Well, my predecessor

25:14.275 --> 25:25.088
had set out deliberately to make it a behavioral 
department. That's the interesting thing is he

25:25.108 --> 25:38.325
was a PhD in international relations from 
Princeton with no background whatever in

25:25.108 --> 25:38.325
numerical quantitative stuff. a most unlikely 
candidate. He had set out to... He'd

25:44.787 --> 25:56.639
gotten in the budget money for a distinguished 
professor. And

25:56.659 --> 26:04.988
he then was trying to make life difficult for Gene 
Benton. I was going to be six weeks late getting

26:06.993 --> 26:18.467
there, so I designated the senior professor as 
acting head without consulting anybody else. I

26:18.547 --> 26:19.828
didn't think I needed to. And Gene Benton was the 
acting head, and I get a call from my

26:22.031 --> 26:35.868
predecessor desperately, a phone call in Ithaca, 
what do I mean by making Benton acting head? He's

26:35.888 --> 26:36.949
going to ruin me. And I find out that he's been 
trying to get rid of Benton. He deprived me of an

26:42.985 --> 26:48.374
office, of a telephone, and making life as 
difficult as possible. He said, Benton's going to

26:48.394 --> 26:50.197
crucify me. I said, if he does, give me a ring and we 
will take care of that problem. But meanwhile,

26:54.985 --> 26:58.111
Benton is staying as acting kid. And there was no 
problem. Gene was too nice a guy. So

27:01.212 --> 27:07.821
I had made my position clear. No, it was very funny. 
I really had no directions particularly at all and

27:11.065 --> 27:18.594
no pressures anywhere. Did you have some goals 
when you got here? Well, I began to figure some out

27:21.839 --> 27:26.865
fairly quickly.

27:28.567 --> 27:29.769
This is a brand new department. One thing that 
interests me is that you don't often get a blank

27:29.789 --> 27:38.139
page on which to write in academia. I had been lucky 
at Cornell in on the founding, essentially. I was

27:44.587 --> 27:46.930
there two years after the school opened. Well, two 
years after the first graduating class, and it was

27:48.552 --> 27:54.540
still being formed. and then here. And so

27:58.210 --> 28:14.728
by the end of the summer, David Maxwell is coming on 
as Hubert's replacement. Dean of Liberal Arts.

28:16.010 --> 28:19.093
Yeah.

28:22.600 --> 28:27.546
Maxwell is interested in some forward planning. 
But I have no particular directions from Maxwell.

28:32.954 --> 28:39.082
I'm as old as he is, and he figures, I think, that 
I've got some notions, maybe. I said, look, Dean, I

28:39.823 --> 28:45.710
want about six months to get familiar with the 
school. I said, this is not unlike Cornell. In

28:48.274 --> 28:51.578
fact, it was exactly the same size as Cornell when 
we came here. 14,000.

28:55.573 --> 28:56.974
And a land grant institution. I was well aware of 
that. Except the College of Liberal Arts of

29:01.279 --> 29:07.725
Cornell was always, it was the center of the 
university's strength. Well, it never had been

29:08.445 --> 29:09.987
here. So,

29:11.108 --> 29:21.818
first thing I did, I have about 30,000 in for a full 
professor in the budget that hasn't been filled.

29:27.397 --> 29:30.640
I've come, but I'm in the head slot. And I said, Dean 
Maxwell, look, I'm in a funny situation here.

29:43.231 --> 29:47.895
My predecessor had designed a PhD program. He had

29:53.337 --> 29:59.944
put it through the winter of 69 to Huber.

30:02.967 --> 30:06.590
Except one of the last things Huber did before he 
left was disapprove it. Meanwhile, my

30:08.472 --> 30:21.505
predecessor has offered and they've accepted six 
assistantships to prospective PhD students.

30:23.780 --> 30:25.983
They're here, and no PhD.

30:28.808 --> 30:32.032
And what's more, no prospects of one. What 
possessed my predecessor to think he could get

30:32.633 --> 30:45.272
one, he only had Benton, Rowe, and himself as 
possible members of a graduate faculty. And to do a

30:46.354 --> 30:50.580
PhD on that is

30:53.041 --> 30:59.671
So I said, Dean, I want to start building this from 
young people. I don't want to bring in on top of

31:01.033 --> 31:03.277
them. I don't want to discourage them. With young 
people, I said, my predecessor has done one thing

31:06.041 --> 31:10.147
well. He has brought four or five young assistant 
professors here who are good. Gary Holder is one,

31:16.970 --> 31:23.839
Dixon, Bob Bernstein. I don't know whether any of 
these, you know Holder, of course. A fellow who

31:28.685 --> 31:39.219
was, when I was coming, decided he better maybe, he 
wasn't so sure he went, but he was good enough that

31:28.685 --> 31:39.219
Rice took him. And another one went to

31:40.120 --> 31:46.909
maybe LSU.
