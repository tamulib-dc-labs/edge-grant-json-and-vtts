00:02.596 --> 00:23.963
1 March June 26 the year 2000 preparing to interview dr. Green hot testing Just it will go This is June 26 now, so just say a sentence mail hi, okay

00:25.090 --> 00:46.947
incidentally anything that we this is June 26 had the pleasure of chatting with dr. Mel Greenhut distinguished professor of economics we are sitting in the sixth floor of the Evans library looking out over a typical June day Mel as we begin would you describe your

00:47.264 --> 00:51.849
growing up and your background and your experience before you came to A&M?

00:52.870 --> 00:57.214
To introduce a reader or a listener to your experience.

00:58.435 --> 01:03.661
You mean all the way back, starting from my early memories.

01:03.681 --> 01:09.246
My dad was a part-time policeman during the Depression years and a part-time window washer.

01:10.287 --> 01:10.528
Where?

01:11.228 --> 01:11.929
In New York City.

01:13.030 --> 01:14.992
And I mean, we were poor.

01:15.693 --> 01:16.714
And he did everything.

01:18.061 --> 01:31.198
And when I finally got off to college many years later, I was determined I didn't want to see that poverty that I had grown up in, and especially to have a father hanging out of big windows.

01:32.440 --> 01:45.857
Actually, we lived out in Rosedale, New York, which is outside of the city, and on, I think it was my tenth birthday, my mother took me to New York City to celebrate my birthday.

01:46.563 --> 01:53.235
And we're walking down a street, and there is my father hanging out of a window about the 15-story high.

01:54.056 --> 01:56.660
My mother spotted him, ran away from me.

01:56.741 --> 01:57.522
I ran after him.

01:57.542 --> 01:58.083
What's wrong?

01:58.824 --> 02:01.369
About four blocks down the way, she said, that was your father.

02:02.731 --> 02:05.095
And I thought, I don't want to do that in my life.

02:05.243 --> 02:11.934
Now I don't know if I want this recorded, but anyway, you asked me the background.

02:12.535 --> 02:16.742
The result was I thought, gee whiz, these economists haven't done anything good, have they?

02:16.822 --> 02:18.284
Maybe I could be an economist.

02:19.105 --> 02:29.642
Well then I landed up in the Army, and when I got out of the Army I was on that wonderful GI Bill, and also I had graduated from college before.

02:29.883 --> 02:31.866
Now what led you to Hofstra?

02:31.886 --> 02:32.567
Why Hofstra?

02:33.391 --> 02:38.440
Well, we lived out on the island, and I was only about 40 miles away in Hempstead.

02:39.742 --> 02:42.026
So, and it was a nice liberal arts college.

02:43.929 --> 02:46.553
I did want to go to Brown University.

02:46.914 --> 02:48.717
Frankly, I was a cut-up in high school.

02:50.131 --> 02:51.332
And Brown didn't want me.

02:51.452 --> 02:53.014
I thought they made a big mistake.

02:53.034 --> 03:00.222
In fact, I even started off at Purdue, one of the few schools I would take a young jerk.

03:00.242 --> 03:06.790
And again, we don't want that word in there, but off the record, if you ask me personal, I would come back personally.

03:07.951 --> 03:18.923
So anyway, when I got out of the Army, I decided, by gosh, I would become a do-gooder economist.

03:20.287 --> 03:23.274
And I got married when I was in the Army.

03:24.336 --> 03:30.570
And so after the war I got, went back to where my wife lived, which was Granite City, Illinois.

03:32.474 --> 03:35.140
And I landed up at Washington University.

03:36.706 --> 03:38.489
And took my doctorate there.

03:39.610 --> 03:41.353
And we had a wonderful university there.

03:41.453 --> 03:44.918
Arthur Holly Compton was the chancellor of the university.

03:45.739 --> 03:48.843
One of the Compton boys, Carl and Arthur Holly.

03:48.863 --> 03:50.846
They both got Nobel's in physics.

03:51.507 --> 03:54.451
Fantastic people.

03:54.471 --> 03:59.719
And how far should, now I'm already up to.

03:59.779 --> 04:02.983
And then where'd you start your academic career?

04:04.766 --> 04:05.667
At Auburn.

04:06.946 --> 04:08.830
almost at Mizzou.

04:09.131 --> 04:10.514
In fact, I had two offers.

04:11.175 --> 04:14.743
One was at Mizzou and one was at Auburn.

04:16.045 --> 04:17.929
And frankly, I liked Auburn.

04:18.130 --> 04:21.196
It looked pretty good from my standpoint.

04:21.216 --> 04:25.225
And so we went down there, my wife and I.

04:27.247 --> 04:39.299
We had one youngster at that time, it's 1948 that I'm talking about now, one little girl, and another woman being born in St.

04:39.319 --> 04:40.080
Louis.

04:40.100 --> 04:41.221
My wife stayed behind.

04:41.961 --> 04:45.585
We went down to orbit.

04:45.605 --> 04:47.567
Now is that, well, what else back then?

04:47.787 --> 04:54.874
And then where, from there to wherever you were when you came to A&M?

04:55.462 --> 05:03.711
I learned early in the game, and I don't know if we want any of this recorded, that you have to have a PhD, Mel.

05:03.831 --> 05:05.052
That was the department head.

05:05.473 --> 05:12.941
And I had finished my residency at Washington U. I was unhappy about the pay and so forth.

05:12.961 --> 05:17.666
And frankly, I apparently was a pretty good teacher, and he kept me employed in the summertime.

05:19.208 --> 05:25.114
And by the time I got my doctorate, which was in fairly quick time, I got it by 1951,

05:25.297 --> 05:37.054
The department head, who was a real neat man, Charles Hanson, said, gee, Mel, I'm going to disappoint you with pay, but we're putting you on tenure now.

05:40.619 --> 05:44.384
He gave me a tiny pay boost and the dean just didn't have the money.

05:45.146 --> 05:46.948
I said, well, I'll tell you now, Charles.

05:47.028 --> 05:49.912
I'm happy to be on tenure, but I'm leaving as soon as I can.

05:51.555 --> 05:53.818
Meanwhile, the Korean War broke out.

05:55.283 --> 05:57.147
and I happen to be a military reservist.

05:58.850 --> 06:06.085
And I'm also getting close now to finishing my... Oh, I'm backtracking.

06:06.747 --> 06:09.112
This is before the doctorate, before I had finished it.

06:10.535 --> 06:15.064
The Korean War had broken out, and I'm finishing my dissertation.

06:16.343 --> 06:23.433
I'm within about six months and lo and behold I landed up coming from the university where I was teaching.

06:24.174 --> 06:26.898
And again I ran out of context but I tried.

06:28.680 --> 06:33.427
And I was opening the front door of my house and boy there's my wife standing there.

06:33.788 --> 06:36.091
We had about three kids at this stage of the game.

06:36.151 --> 06:40.297
I'm in 1950 in my memory bank.

06:42.520 --> 06:46.165
And I'm roughly in the month of December, November of 1950.

06:46.735 --> 06:53.585
My wife is standing there with two of our kids, if I recall correctly, and my wife is trembling and angry.

06:55.027 --> 06:55.768
What's wrong, honey?

06:56.750 --> 07:00.035
You didn't tell me you would call back in service.

07:00.055 --> 07:01.837
Boy, if anyone started trembling, it was me.

07:02.058 --> 07:02.679
What do you mean?

07:03.319 --> 07:04.982
She shoved special orders at me.

07:05.162 --> 07:07.165
Oh, my.

07:07.526 --> 07:15.898
Boy, I looked at it, and sure enough, not only was I being recalled, I was being recalled to the same division I had been with many, many years before.

07:17.212 --> 07:21.558
Oh, I mean, that was one of the most nerve-racking moments of my life.

07:21.959 --> 07:32.955
I had a couple of experiences in my life that I would say were nerve-racking, and this one was possibly the worst because I had been working for the doctorate from actually 1940.

07:33.095 --> 07:43.270
I got out in the end of 45, became a civilian, went on the GI Bill, and by 50, I've been working

07:44.296 --> 07:46.039
double doing things.

07:46.120 --> 08:06.118
I was on the GI Bill, I was tutoring on the side, I was a graduate assistant all through 46 to 48, finished all my residency with overloaded work and subsequent to that teaching at Auburn and at the same time at Auburn I was in

08:06.908 --> 08:35.397
doing other things besides teaching, writing my dissertation and all of that stuff, and all of a sudden to go back in the service, and I was almost finished with the dissertation, and I thought, Lord Almighty, if I'm back in the Army for one year, two years, three years, by the time I go back to Washington University then with a dissertation, that will now be outdated, and also committee may have changed Army and everything I thought I had accomplished,

08:35.714 --> 08:37.136
I'm going to start from scratch."

08:37.877 --> 08:41.001
Meanwhile, Ted Williams, a fantastic baseball player, remember him?

08:41.843 --> 08:50.735
That fellow might have established records that would still stand today if he hadn't spent three or four years in World War II, plus then in the Korean War.

08:51.296 --> 08:57.064
Anyway, long story short, they had misdelivered, unbelievably, the

08:58.124 --> 09:01.227
Pentagon or whoever was distributing these orders back then.

09:01.908 --> 09:18.587
They had misdelivered something like 87, or not 87, 81 people in Alabama in reserve category, such as I was, had been ordered to different places, and they had failed to deliver those orders on time.

09:19.308 --> 09:27.777
So what my wife was showing me, and it took me about 30 minutes of nerve-wracking searching and reading and thinking, Lord Almighty, I'm back in.

09:28.347 --> 09:37.773
And my wife always knew I hated good vibes, so she actually technically thought I was going to sneak out of the house one day and be gone and say, honey, I'm sorry.

09:37.793 --> 09:38.695
I couldn't help it.

09:39.333 --> 09:41.896
I didn't want it, but they took me back.

09:42.337 --> 09:44.179
It was a cancellation of order.

09:44.199 --> 09:46.041
Oh, my.

09:46.101 --> 09:47.783
And they had never delivered the original.

09:48.524 --> 09:59.117
And incidentally, interestingly for the fact of stories, about a couple of weeks later, my wife and I went to Fort Benning, which was not far from Auburn.

09:59.917 --> 10:04.203
And Auburn was basically one of those teetotaling towns, can we say?

10:04.283 --> 10:06.285
No one teetotaled except

10:06.721 --> 10:11.389
You didn't have any place in town there that you could really enjoy yourself, and now I'm celebrating.

10:11.409 --> 10:13.112
I'm not in there.

10:13.272 --> 10:15.816
Maybe I could finish that dissertation and get the degree.

10:17.098 --> 10:29.799
We went to Fort Benning, and I'm sitting there, and some fellow came over to our table, my wife and I, and we chatted with him, and I mentioned that, boy, I'm happy not to be here with you.

10:29.819 --> 10:31.041
I'm a civilian.

10:31.477 --> 10:37.046
He said, well, I'm not happy to be here because I was a civilian as of a couple of months ago.

10:37.086 --> 10:41.333
And they got me in, and then he topped my story in a sense.

10:42.275 --> 10:45.760
He said, and just shows you the military can't get fouled up.

10:46.582 --> 10:48.404
They sent him to some place in Florida.

10:49.306 --> 10:51.289
He sold a business that he had.

10:51.309 --> 10:52.431
I don't know what you call what business.

10:52.491 --> 10:54.134
Maybe he was a dry cleaner or something.

10:54.895 --> 10:58.581
He sold his business because he was going back in.

10:59.152 --> 11:04.782
got off a train in Florida, looked around for a carrier, looked around for an MP, looked around for anyone.

11:04.822 --> 11:07.226
There was no one that resembled anyone in the military.

11:07.266 --> 11:13.077
And he had to check with the station master and he wired the AG in D.C.

11:13.297 --> 11:15.962
and they had sent him to the wrong place.

11:18.524 --> 11:28.719
So they sent him back home, and he awaited new orders, and this shows you how fouled up we were during the Korean War, and of course we know of many foul ups during World War II.

11:28.739 --> 11:32.744
All right, so this is 1950, and you get your dissertation finished.

11:32.805 --> 11:41.477
I finished it in about April of 51, and I got my doctorate, and actually in July I took my oral exam.

11:41.497 --> 11:43.620
All right, now after Auburn, then where?

11:44.292 --> 11:55.488
Then right after Auburn, because of my disappointment with the pay boost, and I thought I'm still eligible to be pulled back in the Korean War.

11:55.848 --> 11:58.452
I didn't mind being in reserve.

11:58.692 --> 12:00.114
I didn't mind being in World War II.

12:00.575 --> 12:05.041
I didn't want to go back at this stage in my life unless there was a real conflict.

12:06.603 --> 12:09.507
And frankly, a year and a half later,

12:10.128 --> 12:19.221
The government changed, the military regulations were altered, and I was able to go in what was called standby reserve.

12:19.382 --> 12:29.757
Not active, not ready, not anything like that, standby, which meant that there were no promotions, inline promotions, no pay, no summertime duty.

12:30.243 --> 12:35.088
And no president could declare war and you go in service, only Congress.

12:35.969 --> 12:43.316
And that was for all those of us who had served a certain amount of time in the military, which was wonderful.

12:44.197 --> 12:45.258
And I know how I felt.

12:45.578 --> 12:52.104
I felt sorry for Ted Williams to have to go in service again and end his baseball career to an extent.

12:53.125 --> 12:59.912
And anyway, so meanwhile, backtracking, and this has been very incoherent,

12:59.892 --> 13:04.437
because I'm jumping times and backtracking.

13:05.258 --> 13:15.409
But anyway, I went to work for the government as price controller in Birmingham, Alabama.

13:15.710 --> 13:18.873
I was chief economist because I wanted to leave Auburn.

13:18.893 --> 13:21.196
I was unhappy that, by gosh, here's tenure.

13:21.216 --> 13:23.098
You've got a lifetime job with us.

13:23.770 --> 13:25.252
but we can't afford to pay you."

13:26.213 --> 13:28.576
And that just sort of rankled me.

13:29.717 --> 13:49.221
So the first crack out of the barrel, and as you know, as professors, we don't jump in the middle of the year typically to another faculty, and here was an opening at the Birmingham Office of Price Stabilization, chief economist, good payment than I was getting.

13:50.163 --> 13:54.631
by far at Ormond, and I was just unhappy enough.

13:55.172 --> 13:59.359
And by the way, Charles Hansen and I have stayed friends throughout our lives.

14:01.483 --> 14:04.868
So anyway, I went to work in Birmingham, Alabama, OPS.

14:06.311 --> 14:10.959
But I didn't like it, and I don't mind saying that there were graft opportunities.

14:11.660 --> 14:12.702
That just rankled me.

14:13.163 --> 14:15.006
I was trying to live a better life than

14:15.830 --> 14:19.036
than that possible alternative.

14:20.198 --> 14:26.730
So the first chance I had to go back into academia, which was about six, eight months later, I jumped at it and went to Mississippi State.

14:28.112 --> 14:37.028
Unfortunately, Mississippi State, gosh, I'm saying things that, you know, I really don't think should be in print, but Mississippi State had

14:37.008 --> 14:43.410
It was a nice university, but the people were teetotalers, except they really were not.

14:43.792 --> 14:46.461
I learned how to drink martinis there and other things.

14:47.386 --> 15:04.928
And any person who's leaving town, and this may indicate some sort of bigotry of all of us, but anyone who left town, especially if they've gone out of the state, please pick up XYZ bottles and so forth and so on.

15:05.488 --> 15:07.050
And it was sort of farcical.

15:07.551 --> 15:10.795
So I didn't, I must admit, I didn't.

15:10.775 --> 15:14.120
I really liked the culture to that extent.

15:15.161 --> 15:17.765
So after Mississippi State, we went to Rollins College.

15:18.306 --> 15:21.771
I loved small academic colleges.

15:22.512 --> 15:40.258
That was real good, but I started having great luck on publishing and had different universities, including Penn State and Dartmouth and others, starting to make overtures of real interest to me.

15:41.217 --> 15:42.820
And stayed at Rollins.

15:42.880 --> 15:55.863
I became director of the Division of Social Sciences, I think it was, and also ran the placement service on the side to make sure I had enough income because I had a budding family.

15:56.544 --> 15:58.247
By that stage, we had four kids.

15:59.442 --> 16:03.606
And I'm still hungry, mind you, and that was always a tip off with me.

16:04.687 --> 16:08.750
I found that sometimes in academia the more you move the better off you are.

16:09.771 --> 16:16.658
Even though my wife, almost every place we went to landed up as president of the Newcomers Club, president of the Women's Club on the campus.

16:16.678 --> 16:20.821
She played at Auburn in the symphony and so forth.

16:21.982 --> 16:28.268
So I forced that poor lady to move and move and move.

16:29.851 --> 16:33.137
Rollins, a wonderful place.

16:33.558 --> 16:42.294
We were doing real nice in many ways, but by gosh, Florida State beckoned, and I thought the offer there was pretty doggone good.

16:43.496 --> 16:49.547
Also, at the time, I had other opportunities, such as North Carolina, which published my dissertation as a book.

16:51.603 --> 16:54.548
But rather than go to North Carolina, we went to Florida State.

16:55.610 --> 16:56.532
And what year was that?

16:56.592 --> 16:57.774
That was in 1957.

16:58.576 --> 17:10.978
Then at Florida State, oh, things were going real well for me, and Berkeley made an overture for a tenured professorship.

17:10.958 --> 17:14.502
And I told my wife, well, I think we're going to leave.

17:14.582 --> 17:18.907
And meanwhile, she's president of the Women's Club or something in Tallahassee.

17:20.288 --> 17:26.676
And she got pretty upset over that one, and especially at Berkeley, raising four kids.

17:26.696 --> 17:32.262
She didn't like the four-letter words that she had heard were being used by people around Berkeley at U of Cal.

17:33.543 --> 17:35.886
So at that point,

17:37.992 --> 17:47.931
An old friend of mine became dean at the U of Richmond, and he called me and said, I've got a wonderful setup for you.

17:48.572 --> 17:58.431
Come as my associate dean and be the director of the evening division, and we'll give you 100 percent freedom ad infinitum.

18:00.368 --> 18:10.902
I guess maybe in partial protest to my wife's refusal to consider Berkeley, I took her away from Florida State, though we both loved it, and we went to Richmond.

18:11.287 --> 18:16.154
And I had wonderful years at Richmond, especially in consulting.

18:17.135 --> 18:19.038
I lined up consulting for AT&T.

18:19.078 --> 18:32.296
I got more money from them in one year as a consultant with them, because I was a consultant to an executive committee involving the presidents of, or vice presidents, chiefly rather, of the different Bell systems throughout the country.

18:32.336 --> 18:39.285
Michigan Bell was one, and C&P of Virginia was on that thing.

18:39.265 --> 18:54.742
Very lucrative, and besides that, being in proximity to D.C., I did some research with Amarad Research Corporation and others, and I was making the first really good money beyond that of a college professor.

18:55.443 --> 19:06.555
My money at the University of Richmond was pretty darn good because I was associate dean of the day division and director of the evening division with other gratuities going.

19:07.615 --> 19:16.912
But meanwhile, I was having a lot of good luck, academic success, another book or two, and several articles going out in top journals.

19:17.693 --> 19:20.178
And Florida State kept saying, come on back, we miss you.

19:21.140 --> 19:24.105
So I decided, oh, and then what happened?

19:25.267 --> 19:39.480
The top of the thing, and Haskell, this is not to suggest anything against being presidents or what have you, universities of all things, but I decided I don't want to be an administrator, not really go full-time.

19:40.381 --> 19:51.932
And they were severing the evening division from the School of Business, and they asked me if I would be the dean of the evening division, and they were giving it some sort of a name.

19:51.912 --> 19:53.213
I don't even recall what.

19:53.293 --> 19:54.314
I said, absolutely no.

19:54.395 --> 19:56.016
I don't want to go full-time deaning.

19:57.738 --> 19:59.360
I'm an academician.

19:59.400 --> 20:00.981
I've got to do research.

20:02.363 --> 20:10.231
So at that point, meanwhile, Florida State is saying, anytime you want to come back, come on back.

20:11.052 --> 20:20.181
And at this point in my life, I thought, well, I had to become a dean now, and that means really changing my love, and my love was

20:21.190 --> 20:22.472
economics and research.

20:23.513 --> 20:29.863
So we went back to Florida State, and I had good luck.

20:29.883 --> 20:36.753
A few years later, a fellow named Bill Wallace and another fellow, Bernie Sligar, you mentioned LSU.

20:38.215 --> 20:42.742
Bill was a dean of the School of Business at LSU.

20:43.543 --> 20:49.392
Bernie, I think, was at that time provost at LSU.

20:50.198 --> 20:52.161
And they both wanted me to go to LSU.

20:54.745 --> 21:04.320
And boy, they offered a nice deal for me, and I told my wife, Mari, this is around 1965 now, honey, I think we're going to leave Florida State again.

21:05.342 --> 21:15.598
Well, we had just been back there for about three more years, and she had relocated herself in the community the way she liked it and wanted it.

21:16.169 --> 21:18.132
And here I'm threatening to leave again."

21:18.653 --> 21:22.899
Well, she said, well, if you're leaving, you're leaving me and the kids here.

21:24.241 --> 21:33.574
And by this stage of the game, my oldest daughter now was almost ready for college, and she wanted to go to Florida State, which she subsequently did.

21:33.614 --> 21:39.203
Anyway, so my wife stopped me on the LSU move.

21:39.223 --> 21:41.586
LSU will come back when I talk about Irrewater.

21:43.456 --> 21:53.425
Anyway, so I said no to Bernie, and Bernie, by the way, about four or five years later became president of Florida State University.

21:53.846 --> 21:54.807
He left LSU.

21:55.828 --> 22:01.293
And he was, by the way, an economist, and just a dandy person.

22:01.613 --> 22:02.774
I've always been fond of him.

22:03.455 --> 22:07.419
Bill Ross was a dandy fellow at LSU.

22:09.781 --> 22:12.163
So I'm unhappy because

22:12.734 --> 22:20.456
Well, I didn't want to go to LSU, and so here we are again at Florida State.

22:20.536 --> 22:27.756
And I love Florida State, but as I indicated earlier, I didn't want the maximum dollar that I could get.

22:27.736 --> 22:37.287
I mean, so often I'm getting opportunities and saying no, no, especially like northern universities.

22:37.367 --> 22:48.679
I went, I don't know what year it was, I was at Michigan State, somewhere around the 65 period, and they wanted to hold on to me with a wonderful deal, and my wife was having apoplexy.

22:48.719 --> 22:51.162
She never wanted to move, and I kept moving her.

22:51.142 --> 22:59.012
And when that ties up with how I came here to A&M with the promise, I was like explaining them a little bit.

22:59.813 --> 23:11.327
But in any event, so we don't go to LSU, we're still at Florida State, and Al Chalk, who I knew slightly, called me and said,

23:11.729 --> 23:14.035
Would you want to come and give a few lectures here?

23:14.115 --> 23:15.979
We'll pay you X, Y, Z and so forth."

23:15.999 --> 23:17.723
Well okay, I don't mind lecturing.

23:17.783 --> 23:18.866
It comes automatically.

23:18.886 --> 23:24.299
I've been doing this for almost ten years now since I got out of the Army.

23:25.221 --> 23:28.489
I could fall off out of a bed and give a lecture.

23:29.043 --> 23:31.365
on what subject you want to borrow.

23:31.385 --> 23:34.248
I mean, subject only economics, mind you.

23:34.268 --> 23:36.731
So I came here and saw a lot of art.

23:36.751 --> 23:37.451
What year was that?

23:37.692 --> 23:42.656
This was in 1965, actually, when I gave some lectures over.

23:44.018 --> 23:46.460
And some of this I'm going to mention, I don't know really.

23:47.101 --> 23:56.350
You're going to have to be real careful on even what you give me to edit, because I'm telling you exactly what you asked me, what my life was like, and I'm telling you.

23:57.140 --> 24:10.535
Anyway, so I gave a couple of lectures here and met the faculty, and the next thing I know is Al tells me that Earl Wetter doesn't like him, is unhappy with the Department of Economics.

24:10.555 --> 24:16.661
The Department of Economics was, and you probably know much more than I'm going to be able to tell you, because you were here.

24:17.783 --> 24:22.708
He said, the Department of Economics is loaded with these hotbed liberals, Earl Wetter,

24:23.380 --> 24:26.905
And this is Al Chalk telling me this.

24:26.925 --> 24:39.220
Well, I'm not popular with Al, but I think you would be the type of man that Earl Rudder would like to have and would back.

24:41.924 --> 24:43.706
I said, oh well, I'm interested.

24:43.786 --> 24:45.809
I'm sort of still fighting with my wife.

24:46.049 --> 24:47.912
I didn't go to Berkeley once because of her.

24:47.952 --> 24:52.037
I didn't go to Penn State, frankly, once because of her.

24:52.760 --> 24:54.622
I didn't go to LSU because of her.

24:54.662 --> 25:07.799
She's a wonderful lady, but by gosh, she keeps me at places, and after a while, I just find jobs getting better, and it depends on what this job will offer me, et cetera.

25:08.941 --> 25:21.417
Well, to make a longer story, shorter but interesting, the next thing I knew is I was asked to come back to the campus to meet Earl Redder and to bring my wife.

25:23.928 --> 25:26.453
And this was about how long after you gave the lectures?

25:26.473 --> 25:27.294
This was about two months.

25:27.314 --> 25:30.921
This was about January, maybe, in 1966.

25:32.003 --> 25:37.613
And this one story coming up that I know you'll like, and I wouldn't mind seeing this in print.

25:37.633 --> 25:42.983
I think Margaret Rudder might even enjoy it.

25:44.819 --> 25:58.339
Ostensibly, again, giving a lecture or something, but basically to consider the job as department head and learn more about the university and the environments of Bryan College Station.

26:01.264 --> 26:06.191
Frank Hewitt was then the dean of the College of Swiplash, you know, Haskell.

26:07.032 --> 26:14.303
Anyway, Earl was out of town, if I recall, the first day when Ma and I were here.

26:15.599 --> 26:18.662
And they had a party for us somewhere.

26:18.722 --> 26:20.544
Maybe it was at Firecrest.

26:20.564 --> 26:21.845
I don't recall.

26:22.025 --> 26:24.508
Maybe it was down at the Marriott, was it?

26:25.909 --> 26:29.192
Down here on Texas Avenue, umpteen years back with them.

26:29.212 --> 26:30.734
We had a faculty club, too.

26:30.994 --> 26:31.574
The Ramada?

26:32.135 --> 26:32.696
Ramada.

26:32.776 --> 26:33.256
That was it.

26:34.617 --> 26:41.404
Anyway, but the next day, Earl was back, and he wanted to interview me, so Frank Hubert tells me.

26:42.650 --> 26:52.871
And I learned, of course, from Al Chalk, that the reason Earl Redder did not particularly like Al was Al wanted to bring Willie Nelson to the campus.

26:55.436 --> 27:04.033
And Earl therefore thought, well, by gosh, Willie Nelson, Al Chalk wants this fellow, and there were other fellows, John Tracy in the Department of Econ, remember John?

27:04.739 --> 27:11.508
who used profanity quite a lot, even before profanity became the N-words via Hollywood of today.

27:11.568 --> 27:13.972
I'm unhappy with Hollywood.

27:15.173 --> 27:23.325
Anyway, Al Chalk was being victimized by association rather than what Al stood for.

27:23.585 --> 27:28.552
If Earl Weather had ever really known Al Chalk, he would have never wanted to replace him.

27:29.433 --> 27:33.058
Al was setting up a fine department in terms of teaching.

27:33.646 --> 27:41.683
I think the rapport between the professors back then and the students was possibly at an optimal.

27:43.066 --> 27:52.927
And Al knew it, and it was obvious from everything I could gather, that by gosh, teaching in this department is pretty outstanding, but they only had three PhDs or two, was it?

27:52.947 --> 27:54.270
Al Chalk and Irv Linger.

27:56.258 --> 28:15.364
Anyway, I was told by Al and then Frank Hubert, of course, who was doing much of the negotiating when Earl wasn't there, that they were better to back economics as far as a fellow could take it, because they were dreaming of great academic success in the university.

28:17.032 --> 28:27.345
More particularly, the picture I was getting of Earl Rudder, and I knew of him because of his military accomplishments and my own interests and what have you.

28:30.549 --> 28:40.542
I knew that this fellow, Earl Rudder, loved A&M, but he was unhappy with Al Chalk, but not for the right reason.

28:42.243 --> 28:49.137
But he just wanted a great university and would really back anyone who wanted to do things.

28:50.380 --> 28:54.689
Meanwhile, one of the graduates of A&M was a fellow named Larry Faureka.

28:55.671 --> 28:58.156
Now, where does Larry Faureka come into this picture?

28:58.176 --> 29:01.804
Well, Larry Faureka is an economist who wanted me to go to Penn State.

29:02.982 --> 29:11.044
Many years before, Larry was a catalyst for my wanting to go to Penn State until my wife said, I don't want to go up to the north anymore.

29:11.084 --> 29:11.966
I lived in Illinois.

29:11.986 --> 29:13.009
I want to stay south.

29:14.930 --> 29:20.816
And Earl would have thought the world of Larry, who is now Dean at Harvard.

29:21.156 --> 29:22.398
And he'd grown up in Bryant.

29:22.538 --> 29:24.520
And he had grown up in Bryant, as you say.

29:24.600 --> 29:25.281
Yes, indeed.

29:25.701 --> 29:27.343
And he was quite a golfer, by the way.

29:27.363 --> 29:30.065
An excellent golfer.

29:30.085 --> 29:39.435
Anyway, so Earl had contacted Larry because Al Chalk had said, the first man we want to bring in to be department head is this fellow.

29:39.803 --> 29:51.255
and so apparently Earl had checked with Larry and Larry said, grab him, do anything he wants, which was the greatest break in the world.

29:51.275 --> 29:55.480
I mean, I've had a life in which I've fallen into good things.

29:57.021 --> 30:01.286
I could even use some military examples of how unbelievable things came out for me.

30:01.726 --> 30:07.212
In retrospect, not the times, sometimes I was pretty unhappy about the way things were unfolding.

30:08.440 --> 30:15.271
When you came for that interview visit, we'll call it.

30:15.311 --> 30:16.953
This is going to be a precious one for you.

30:17.154 --> 30:20.299
What kind of interviews did they have?

30:20.699 --> 30:21.721
What did they ask you?

30:21.761 --> 30:24.525
What did Mr. Rudder seem to be most concerned about?

30:24.645 --> 30:27.390
Well, maybe I even beat him to the punch, frankly.

30:27.410 --> 30:34.701
I'm sitting in front of him and right above him is LBJ, a big painting.

30:35.153 --> 30:40.562
I understand we've got a problem right now on the campus with something of that kind.

30:40.582 --> 30:41.945
I'll not go into details.

30:42.005 --> 30:45.110
You could handle this as you will ask them.

30:45.130 --> 30:57.111
And I must admit I'm unhappy about what I heard and I hope Herb Richardson, and I may land up calling him, he's an old friend of mine, and say, for heaven's sake, Herb, get that painting right back up on that wall.

30:57.563 --> 31:03.993
Anyway, I'm looking at LBJ because, oh, I skipped, again, I go out of context.

31:04.634 --> 31:21.782
The main reason I wanted to get out of Florida State, about a year or so, and perhaps prior to this, I'm not cognizant of the exact timing, but I think it was at Christmas, right after Al Chalk had had me here to give a seminar.

31:23.551 --> 31:29.561
We're at a party in Tallahassee, and about five professors got me in the corner.

31:29.581 --> 31:31.183
I wish Molly were here on this thing.

31:32.145 --> 31:36.392
They had me in the corner of the room with the dean there, a fellow named Larry Chalmers.

31:36.412 --> 31:38.055
You probably knew Larry Chalmers.

31:38.075 --> 31:40.699
He became president at U of Kansas.
