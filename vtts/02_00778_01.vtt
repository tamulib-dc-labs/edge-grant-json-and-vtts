00:02.917 --> 00:10.847
This is Deborah Beale, and I am interviewing Mr. 
Lewis Horn on the history of the Texas Engineering

00:02.917 --> 00:10.847
Experiment Station. The date is June 13, 1984.

00:14.932 --> 00:24.124
Introduction in here as to who you are, but I'd like 
to get a little background on you as to education

00:14.932 --> 00:24.124
and how you first came to A&M. Oh, I do want that on 
here. Yeah.

00:32.043 --> 00:48.931
I'm a graduate of Kansas State University in 
industrial journalism, and I've done this

00:32.043 --> 00:48.931
graduate work in industrial education there. I 
worked for Beach Aircraft during the war years,

00:48.951 --> 00:58.827
World War II, that is. and for Boeing Aircraft 
Company. I was a tool engineer for Leach Aircraft

01:04.369 --> 01:14.584
and an engineer project for Boeing.

01:16.207 --> 01:23.397
Then I joined Buckminster Fuller, who was just 
getting underway with his

01:26.735 --> 01:55.797
preformed house circular house that was made of

01:26.735 --> 01:55.797
metals you know aluminum and plastic and

01:26.735 --> 01:55.797
things of that kind and used a circular form to give 
structure and the whole house was fastened from a

01:26.735 --> 01:55.797
pole by cables and tension rings that gave shape to 
the house. And I did the technical writing work

02:02.098 --> 02:25.783
that boosted that information out to the public, 
the magazines, Fortune, Architectural Record,

02:02.098 --> 02:25.783
Architectural Forum, and then all the magazines 
of the various industries and the like metal field

02:26.050 --> 02:32.740
or in the plastics field that would be concerned 
with this design. Are you interested in all that

02:34.001 --> 02:35.924
background? Oh, sure. Oh, okay. Anyway, 
Buckminster Fuller felt that since everybody

02:37.927 --> 02:52.007
needed housing at the end of World War II, that this 
was a quick way of giving housing by utilizing all

02:53.101 --> 03:22.045
the machinery in the industrial plants

02:53.101 --> 03:22.045
that was already set up and the reservoirs of 
workmen were already around and letting them use

02:53.101 --> 03:22.045
the light metals and all the kind of aircraft 
technology, aircraft manufacturing technology

02:53.101 --> 03:22.045
to make the parts for his circular preformed house 
and

03:22.548 --> 03:49.382
so it was all geared for that so that the great big 
cylinder, several great big cylinders would be

03:22.548 --> 03:49.382
hauled in trucks to erection sites and could be set 
up by mechanics

03:22.548 --> 03:49.382
rather than carpenters in just a few days time, 
whereas a conventional house took many months to

03:50.527 --> 04:03.085
build. How did you come to be at A&M? How did I come to 
A&M? Oh, pardon me. Then I went to the University of

04:09.956 --> 04:16.365
Florida and I was, I did the publishing and 
information work for them in the engineering

04:16.936 --> 04:29.656
experiment station there, University of Florida 
College of Engineering. And I was there two years,

04:29.676 --> 04:39.952
then came to Texas A&M and went to work for Dean H.W. 
Barlow, who is the Dean of the College of

04:39.992 --> 04:45.120
Engineering Do you remember what year that was? 
Yes, ma'am. August 1st, 1948.

04:56.728 --> 05:03.658
So then I published the reports. We called them 
bulletins in those days. And later we had a

05:08.244 --> 05:17.537
research report series, then a leaflet series, 
then a reprint series. Slick Paper Magazine,

05:18.158 --> 05:25.066
Portland Magazine, Texas Engineering 
Experiment Station News.

05:32.294 --> 05:47.811
With regard to publishing the bulletins, the 
legislature in setting up the Engineering

05:32.294 --> 05:47.811
Experiment Station wanted engineering 
information that came from research to be sent

05:48.533 --> 05:55.082
over the state as widely as possible. So in those 
days, that was one of the major functions of the

05:55.102 --> 06:06.137
engineering experiment station, to disseminate 
information. And that is stated in the documents

06:06.217 --> 06:15.149
that set up the engineering experiment station. 
Now, did you have a mailing list for those? Yes. As I

06:18.605 --> 06:44.325
recall, the mailing list included many of our 
libraries of the state, where the material would

06:18.605 --> 06:44.325
always be available, and the libraries, the 
public libraries, the big cities, and then we had

06:18.605 --> 06:44.325
governmental agencies on the mailing list too, 
and even smaller libraries over the state then we

06:44.828 --> 07:13.975
the state also traded its publications with those 
other agencies in other states and in other words

06:44.828 --> 07:13.975
many copies were used for exchange purposes we did 
that for quite a number of years then

06:44.828 --> 07:13.975
farther along the way in engine-age trimmer 
station. Apparently this money was not

07:17.742 --> 07:39.169
forthcoming for sending these things out all 
over, so we just somewhat can, you know, revise our

07:17.742 --> 07:39.169
mailing list and send them out not so widely.

07:40.313 --> 07:47.380
and depended on the public writing in its 
documents. That was when you were saying at the

07:47.400 --> 07:50.544
news, which said what the new documents were. Yes, 
yes, we reviewed them in the magazine.

07:56.410 --> 07:59.613
Did all they have were the bulletins when you came, 
right? Yes, ma'am. Whose idea was it to start the

08:00.254 --> 08:04.638
newsletter, that little in-house? It was Dr. 
Mello's idea. to have a newsletter, and I believe

08:09.912 --> 08:16.401
it was in mimeograph form at the time. And he sent 
that out for several years. And in 1950, I

08:19.806 --> 08:29.339
established the Texas Engineering Experiment 
Station News. So after we were underway with that

08:30.541 --> 08:35.548
for several years, And he decided to discontinue 
the mimeograph newsletter because he thought our

08:36.170 --> 08:48.281
magazine was doing the same job and it's just 
wrong. But the glossy news was your idea? Yes,

08:51.484 --> 08:52.725
ma'am. And did you have a lot of trouble getting it 
back? Or did you just, did they say take it and run

08:56.268 --> 08:59.771
with it? Oh, you mean get it reviewed? Or get the 
money to start it? We used local funds for that, and

09:06.545 --> 09:10.609
we never had any problems. That was Dr. Mello's 
idea. He thought that out very wisely. He decided

09:17.676 --> 09:23.823
that there would be fewer strings attached if we 
just used our local money. And in those days, we

09:23.863 --> 09:33.733
made money from fan tests, which we did for outside 
concerns.

09:34.625 --> 09:36.047
made money in other ways. I can't remember all the 
ways. And that all went into our local funds. And so

09:42.213 --> 09:51.023
I was glad we had plenty of money there, so we were 
able to publish this little magazine. Our

09:51.043 --> 09:57.250
circulation was not great at first, but it went 
worldwide. And we received nice comments on it.

10:04.966 --> 10:30.400
With the magazine, it was our idea to emphasize

10:04.966 --> 10:30.400
information, actually publishing

10:04.966 --> 10:30.400
findings that could be used, not just making 
announcements. telling about things that were

10:31.561 --> 10:35.104
happening or are going to be. We actually have data 
and information, useful information, in these

10:35.144 --> 10:58.446
articles that the public could use, the research 
public or the practicing engineer or others out

10:35.144 --> 10:58.446
there in our circulation.

11:00.653 --> 11:01.515
Anything? Am I all right here? Oh yeah, you're 
doing good. You're giving me all sorts of... Was

11:04.901 --> 11:08.769
there anyone in charge of publications before you 
came? Who did that?

11:13.057 --> 11:14.359
Mr. W.D. Scotts was in charge of publications, but 
he also ran the fan testing laboratory. So he, but

11:21.494 --> 11:24.638
he had no background really in it, did he? No, but he 
did a good job publishing it. He just did the

11:27.040 --> 11:28.502
bulletins? The bulletins, yes. So yours was a new 
position when you came? Yes. And so it was, they

11:33.168 --> 11:43.480
were... And when I came, Mr. Schultz devoted his 
full time to the fan testing work. So they were

11:43.500 --> 11:49.146
making a definite effort to try and increase 
publications when they hired you and disseminate

11:43.500 --> 11:49.146
some information. Yes ma'am. We put information 
into the newspapers and magazines, journals,

11:51.447 --> 11:59.480
write articles for journals. And I'd help the men 
write articles for the technical journals. And

12:04.328 --> 12:05.710
I'd write some myself. And it was just interesting 
and fun to do all that. In 1958, I believe it was, you

12:14.279 --> 12:19.185
wrote a historical piece for the news. I don't know 
if you remember that piece or not. Yes, I remember

12:21.327 --> 12:23.550
it. Was that your idea, or did someone ask you to do 
the history? I can't remember anybody asking me. I

12:33.742 --> 12:37.306
think it was my idea, yes. Was it easy to get access 
to people at that time? to find out what their ideas

12:41.887 --> 12:43.769
were? Because I noticed at the end, you said that 
the push now is for outside funding. Oh, yes. You

12:50.477 --> 12:53.180
could just walk in. You could just walk in. A fella 
like myself could just walk into any laboratory.

12:59.267 --> 13:03.352
And we were friends, and fellas would tell me 
things. And sometimes I'd ask them to write

13:03.472 --> 13:10.881
special things for me, and they would do it. They 
were very cooperative, and I got interested in

13:11.705 --> 13:28.962
their work, and I would write up their work, and he 
would tell me all about it, and give me background

13:11.705 --> 13:28.962
information, give me some of their data, and so on, 
and it was fun to write up their material. You were

13:31.365 --> 13:32.906
here when Rose was here. Aaron Rose, yes. Do you 
remember when he left, and why he left? He was here

13:40.561 --> 13:42.904
only one year. And I noticed,

13:42.944 --> 13:53.920
I think he was, this is a little, this might be a 
little bit of a guess. I think he was here from 1958

13:53.940 --> 14:01.390
to 1959, along in there.

14:05.035 --> 14:06.718
I don't know why he left, really. I didn't know if 
you'd uncovered that in your? No. But he went to

14:12.320 --> 14:18.686
California, but he later joined some corporation 
out there, I think. But at the time he left, I don't

14:19.887 --> 14:27.774
believe he had a job.

14:27.974 --> 14:33.439
In the reprints, whose idea was it to reprint? The 
technical articles that were printed in other

14:33.459 --> 14:36.682
magazines? Yes, all right.

14:42.830 --> 14:57.414
Men like to show that they're active in their 
professions, so they write in their own technical

14:42.830 --> 14:57.414
journals, technical journals of their societies

14:42.830 --> 14:57.414
or the trades. And they would submit those 
themselves, yes. And if they needed help in

15:08.530 --> 15:14.298
preparing them or submitting them, why I would 
help them.

15:17.182 --> 15:20.927
They knew where they were going with those 
articles. And quite often, you had researchers

15:20.947 --> 15:35.147
that had theses or dissertations that they wanted 
to turn into technical articles of those kinds.

15:35.167 --> 15:38.031
And they would send those. to the journalists. If 
they needed help in sending them, I would help

15:40.208 --> 15:43.693
them. And that worked out fine. Then we decided to 
buy reprints. So usually the technical

15:51.624 --> 16:04.643
journalists would make us a low price for a 
quantity of reprints, and we would buy them, and

15:51.624 --> 16:04.643
I'd put a jacket on them. It seemed like it was a 
green jacket with the title in it. And with the

16:10.265 --> 16:16.291
Engineering Experiment Station name at the 
bottom. And the date and so on. And we put a reprint

16:18.453 --> 16:20.796
number on it. So that was the reprint series.

16:26.822 --> 16:32.588
And what was the difference between the bulletin 
and The technical report that came out that time?

16:35.927 --> 16:36.488
Research report. Research report. Well...

16:49.423 --> 16:50.885
Think about that one. Yeah, think about that. 
But...

16:58.774 --> 16:59.875
I think with...

17:03.550 --> 17:18.372
I guess the research report was basically a report 
on this particular project and what was found on

17:03.550 --> 17:18.372
the project in the research work in the laboratory 
or in the field. And so its findings were presented

17:19.393 --> 17:32.933
in that format and for the specific audience it 
intended to reach. which was other researchers

17:33.959 --> 17:38.326
and practitioners of that field. The bulletins 
sometimes were a little more general, you know,

17:39.327 --> 17:50.604
covered a wider field, and they were on various 
kinds of subjects. Some of them were rather

17:50.664 --> 18:02.903
technical and specialized, but some were

17:50.664 --> 18:02.903
of broader interest We even published 
proceedings and the like in the bulletin series,

18:04.199 --> 18:11.607
proceedings of conferences.

18:17.373 --> 18:30.426
Along the lines of those proceedings, were those 
conferences that were held by or sponsored at all

18:17.373 --> 18:30.426
by TEAS, or did TEAS just publish these? No, I 
believe most of those were sponsored by the

18:31.283 --> 18:38.073
Engineering Experience Station.

18:41.959 --> 18:50.372
I know they had all the highway conferences and 
they'd list the Civil Engineering Department and

18:41.959 --> 18:50.372
A&M, but they never did list TEAS on the bulletins. 
Occasionally they would, but not always. And I

18:52.776 --> 18:55.941
didn't know if that meant TEAS wasn't involved in 
the actual...

19:00.410 --> 19:01.392
That's a hard one to answer. I think,

19:01.512 --> 19:21.863
like you've indicated, that sometimes a group, 
like maybe in chemical engineering, had a

19:01.512 --> 19:21.863
conference and they wanted somebody to help them 
publish it. And since we had organized facilities

19:21.883 --> 19:26.991
for publishing, I think sometimes those came into 
our bulletin series. And now the highway

19:32.016 --> 19:49.372
publications from the civil engineering 
department

19:32.016 --> 19:49.372
really belonged with us because some of the 
earliest research in the engineering experiment

19:32.016 --> 19:49.372
station involved the highways. That was before 
there was even a highway department in Texas. And

19:53.877 --> 19:56.539
we had bulletins on the earth roads and sand clay 
roads and building the various kind of bridges on

19:57.042 --> 20:09.658
these country roads.

20:13.783 --> 20:21.733
In those days the counties built the roads and then 
some years later Probably five or six years after

20:23.452 --> 20:38.355
the Engineering Experiment Station became 
active,

20:23.452 --> 20:38.355
Texas established the Texas Highway Department. 
So then you had regular highway engineers working

20:38.375 --> 20:47.409
with the roads and you had a state budget and so on. 
But before, they were built by the counties. TTI

20:53.017 --> 21:13.465
was a division of TEAS until this last couple of 
years, according to TEAS, but it's also been

20:53.017 --> 21:13.465
listed for years and years as a separate section of 
the system, the university system. So what was the

21:14.286 --> 21:20.475
actual relationship between

21:14.286 --> 21:20.475
them?

21:22.987 --> 21:30.118
I hope somebody doesn't take offense in 
administration or anything I say, because I might

21:22.987 --> 21:30.118
not be too accurate. But the way I looked at it, we 
were established by the legislature. The

21:39.912 --> 21:42.056
groundwork was laid in 1950.

21:45.060 --> 21:51.610
But it was 1955 before we had actually had 
laboratories and desks in the Texas

21:52.062 --> 21:59.391
Transportation Institute. And I remember

21:59.411 --> 22:11.446
helping TTI out as a publisher. I did some of their 
work free before

22:11.466 --> 22:20.618
they got underway too well. research projects and 
needed somebody to help them publish, and I helped

22:21.931 --> 22:28.720
them publish some of the early reports. Then 
later,

22:29.801 --> 22:44.740
Texas Transportation Institute materials were 
published by the

22:29.801 --> 22:44.740
Texas Engineering Experiment Station. You know, 
through the organization of the Texas

22:44.760 --> 22:49.947
Engineering Experiment Station, but under their 
own format. And I was on one third time with the

22:55.578 --> 23:04.229
Texas Transportation Institute.

23:13.900 --> 23:19.647
We, the Texas Transportation Institute at that 
time, I believe,

23:22.698 --> 23:29.848
began handling its money through the Inchenang 
Experiment Station facilities. You know, it

23:30.810 --> 23:39.202
actually handled its money through the Inchenang 
Experiment Station setup. And this went on for a

23:39.262 --> 23:48.375
lot of years, and then it helped into just a few 
years ago. But somewhere along the line, Quite a

23:53.478 --> 24:04.208
good many years ago, the Texas Transportation 
Institute was considered to be one of the units of

23:53.478 --> 24:04.208
the system.

24:07.732 --> 24:17.361
But when they would go over to the legislature, 
they'd go over alongside of the engineering

24:07.732 --> 24:17.361
experiment station. So it was really financial 
that was the only connection? Yes, the financial

24:19.603 --> 24:23.046
setup was handled in coordination with the 
engineering experience station. With the

24:30.243 --> 24:35.709
engineering experience station, I think, 
supervising on that. When Rudder became

24:37.171 --> 24:47.322
president, all sorts of things changed here at the 
university.

24:47.502 --> 24:49.945
What kind of impact did that have on your job? On my 
job? Yeah, on your job. No. Absolutely not. He was a

24:55.147 --> 24:59.513
fine gentleman, a very good friend, yes. What led 
to the end of the publications in 1963? 53? 63. 63,

25:03.480 --> 25:06.965
yes.

25:12.434 --> 25:17.822
Dr. Winerdi, R. E. Winerdi, was associate 
director of the Engineering Experiment Station

25:18.680 --> 25:47.877
at that time, and he decided he wanted to 
discontinue the Texas Transportation

25:18.680 --> 25:47.877
Institute, I mean the Texas Engineering 
Experiment Station News, and maybe have an annual

25:18.680 --> 25:47.877
publication of some kind, similar to a very 
colorful annual report. So he asked me to

25:49.730 --> 25:59.001
discontinue the news, and of course I did. And

25:59.021 --> 26:18.724
I think about a year later, I was transferred to the 
Texas Transportation Institute, and it was to

25:59.021 --> 26:18.724
give me more opportunities.

26:19.328 --> 26:21.170
That meant salary-wise. And so

26:21.810 --> 26:38.565
Dean Benson enabled me to make a move to the 
Transportation Institute, which I had been with

26:21.810 --> 26:38.565
on one-third time all along.

26:41.288 --> 26:46.292
And this put me with the Transportation Institute 
full time. By that time, the Transportation

26:46.492 --> 26:49.335
Institute and become a full-blown foreign 
musician. And

26:54.448 --> 27:05.762
I immediately started a magazine with them, the 
Texas Transportation Researcher. And this goes

27:06.823 --> 27:08.866
worldwide. We started that in 1965.

27:17.463 --> 27:41.952
I feel that it's helped the Institute a lot in 
getting recognition with technologists and

27:17.463 --> 27:41.952
business people and governmental people all over 
the world and especially in our country.

27:42.708 --> 27:46.892
very interesting correspondence from people we 
reach. And there's an associate dean at the

27:47.933 --> 27:57.021
University of Puerto Rico, wrote me a year or two 
ago. He says, I've been receiving your

27:57.041 --> 28:10.133
publication for 15 years, and I want to thank you 
for this fine publication and the fine work that

27:57.041 --> 28:10.133
you're doing. He was so pleased that we made A&M's 
work known to him. When you left to go to TTI, they

28:18.053 --> 28:25.180
didn't replace you, did they? Well, the first man, 
I guess they brought somebody in to do the work.

28:32.727 --> 28:34.288
They needed somebody to do the work. Well, they 
didn't publish anything for the next 10 years from

28:34.308 --> 28:41.014
us.

28:42.226 --> 28:52.702
An English professor, an assistant professor in 
English, handled the publications on a part-time

28:42.226 --> 28:52.702
basis, and I think he had secretarial help. Then

28:54.725 --> 29:05.382
a young man came in and he did that for several 
years.

29:11.825 --> 29:15.610
Oh, let's see, I'll turn it on. He had been a printer 
in Bryan, ran a printing firm there.

29:24.843 --> 29:36.880
He ran the operation for several years, and then a 
man by the name of Jay Saul came in, and he handled

29:24.843 --> 29:36.880
the information and publishing for the Texas 
Extension Experiment Station. Is that when they

29:37.461 --> 29:39.624
started up the technical bulletin? Yes, ma'am. 
That was his. All they really published for those

29:42.858 --> 29:50.067
10 years after you left were the reports they'd 
send to NASA or to whoever they were doing research

29:42.858 --> 29:50.067
for. Yes. And it drives you crazy trying to find the 
history when you have to go back and there's

29:50.988 --> 29:58.417
nothing there. That's one reason I'm doing the 
interviews is to try and fill in some of those gaps.

30:06.868 --> 30:08.430
Was the printing done here on campus? Yes, ma'am. 
So you did the whole setup? Yes, ma'am. And did you

30:14.330 --> 30:19.578
work with anyone outside of the A&M system in terms 
of? I know you were involved in conferences,

30:20.660 --> 30:28.652
because I read several times you presented papers 
on technical publications and that type of thing.

30:31.776 --> 30:37.445
Were those professional conferences you'd go to? 
Give me your exact question again. I read an

30:40.810 --> 30:42.953
article that you had presented a paper on the 
publication of technical reports or something

30:43.523 --> 30:51.733
along that line at a conference. Oh, yes. And did 
you get to go to a lot of those conferences?

30:58.642 --> 31:00.144
I guess I could have gone. I didn't go to too many. I 
didn't know if this was something you got to do all

31:03.989 --> 31:08.294
the time or if this was just... I didn't do too much 
of that, no. Oh, yeah, I remember now. That was with

31:13.625 --> 31:20.853
the American College Public Relations 
Association and organizations at that time. I

31:20.873 --> 31:34.027
went to some of those conferences, and when asked 
to, I presented a paper, but I didn't do too much of

31:20.873 --> 31:34.027
that. When

31:34.047 --> 31:40.834
TEAS became, or when A&M became a system, You were 
here then. Yes, ma'am. And did that really change

31:44.283 --> 31:47.829
anything, the way things worked? No.

31:54.640 --> 32:07.902
You know, down here at this level, you just do your 
work and you just kept the work going regardless of

31:54.640 --> 32:07.902
what was happening in administration.

32:09.350 --> 32:19.660
You made this known in your publications

32:09.350 --> 32:19.660
with the masthead and things like that, that the 
organization had changed a little. And there

32:19.680 --> 32:30.170
would be news stories in there about a chancellor 
that had been appointed and so on.

32:31.611 --> 32:33.933
But it never affected the work. I guess in science 
and engineering You

32:40.096 --> 32:47.424
always have this work to do. And other things don't 
affect it very much. How about changes in

32:51.789 --> 32:54.172
directors of teas? Did that affect you much? Not 
too much. I got along with all of them, yes. Did they

32:59.698 --> 33:03.602
all pretty much leave you alone to get your work 
done? Yes, ma'am. I mean, they seemed to

33:04.423 --> 33:10.069
appreciate what I was doing and let me do it my way. 
I've always appreciated that on the part of my

33:10.859 --> 33:17.185
superiors. They always let me do what I needed to 
do. Once in a while, you know, they would point out

33:20.849 --> 33:29.337
something that they knew I'd be doing or covering 
and so on. And I was always glad to do that. When they

33:35.663 --> 33:40.107
brought in the big push for the Nuclear Science 
Center and all that, I noticed for quite a few

33:40.458 --> 33:48.886
months you had lots of publications on what a 
nuclear reactor does and all this type of thing.

33:49.187 --> 33:52.270
Was that part of a big publicity push by the 
university? Yes, ma'am.

33:59.216 --> 34:08.946
At that time, I was also writing all the big 
proposals for engineering experimentation. And

34:09.837 --> 34:17.705
we kind of had a little corner on the proposal 
business because we had the facilities. I helped

34:17.905 --> 34:37.566
write the proposal for the Nuclear Science Center 
and even helped the physics department with the

34:17.905 --> 34:37.566
proposal for the cyclotron, for the engineering 
experiment station. And with our data processing

34:37.748 --> 34:48.981
facilities, we got the first building and then we 
got an expansion. We expanded the plant later on.

34:54.327 --> 34:59.754
And all along, like with the data processing, we 
kept going to better machines. We started out with

34:59.974 --> 35:05.140
650 way back. Then we'd go to bigger machines

35:05.677 --> 35:22.924
until we ended up with this great big one now.

35:23.004 --> 35:33.000
It's a nuclear science center, data processing 
center,

35:23.004 --> 35:33.000
cyclotron.

35:34.364 --> 35:58.752
Like with the Nuclear Science Center, we'd help 
researchers in agriculture and other fields at

35:34.364 --> 35:58.752
A&M to write proposals

35:34.364 --> 35:58.752
for money because they would be using our 
facilities and we'd help them with the proposals.

36:01.195 --> 36:15.509
So I'd be asking for the right things so they would 
be presenting their best program to those people

36:01.195 --> 36:15.509
that would be doing the financing.

36:18.592 --> 36:28.502
And at one time, I had a whole side of a wall of 
shelves filled with data sheets on almost every

36:28.668 --> 36:33.836
scientist at A&M. You could have the data sheet 
there, pull it down to put in the proposal. Sounds

36:40.086 --> 36:40.988
like a good idea. Yeah. And then also, sometimes 
the men would get so busy after they

36:41.709 --> 36:55.671
got their nuclear science, got their, you

36:41.709 --> 36:55.671
know,

36:58.148 --> 37:06.917
reactor, they forget to write these quarterly 
reports that were required by the agency in

36:58.148 --> 37:06.917
Washington. And I'd help them write those, you 
know.

37:16.126 --> 37:19.048
Kind of fill in the detail a little bit, yeah. Go in 
with the questions and say, okay, now I've got to

37:19.068 --> 37:22.972
fill in this blank here and this blank here. What's 
the answer? Well, mostly you wrote paragraphs on

37:24.694 --> 37:26.856
it. what you did and how you were using the 
facility. So you'd go chasing them around the

37:30.471 --> 37:35.317
facility as they were working, saying, okay, now 
tell me this. Yeah, and they would, yes, and they

37:35.337 --> 37:48.991
would, the men would approve those and send them in 
to Washington,

37:35.337 --> 37:48.991
yes. Now,

37:49.011 --> 37:57.180
I noticed that towards the end of the 50s, more and 
more articles were being written on the highway

37:58.932 --> 38:03.739
research in there. Was this a result of a big growth 
in TTI's activities in the late 50s? Because they

38:13.154 --> 38:15.217
were established in 55. Yes ma'am. And did it take 
them a couple of years to really get going? We went

38:22.348 --> 38:27.015
with smaller programs at first and the highway 
department

38:28.885 --> 38:57.222
kept building the budgets for us and it took years 
to develop the budgets that we know nowadays and

38:28.885 --> 38:57.222
then somewhere along the line there was interest 
in the in the regional highway program and a lot of

38:28.885 --> 38:57.222
research that was done by TTI had application in 
the inter-regional highway program. And we took

39:06.017 --> 39:10.223
years to build that. I

39:10.243 --> 39:28.305
guess it's in the late 50s, we started getting into 
the highway safety field and began building

39:10.243 --> 39:28.305
things to make the highways safer, especially 
safer when collisions were involved and one of our

39:29.112 --> 39:57.178
first breaks was to develop a breakaway signpost 
and that idea is still used today and we still do

39:29.112 --> 39:57.178
breakaway research for the Federal Highway 
Administration and we do research to soften the

39:57.817 --> 40:07.027
impact of vehicles striking solid objects or any 
kind of objects.

40:10.130 --> 40:23.163
So we have done a lot of work with impact and 
attenuation devices.

40:23.183 --> 40:24.685
How did the energy crisis in the mid-70s affect 
TTI's research?

40:31.098 --> 40:33.120
Well... Or did it?

40:40.287 --> 40:47.133
You were...

40:47.153 --> 40:54.300
It affected it, all right, but I... You know, our 
people were always energy. conscious especially

40:54.668 --> 41:19.562
our economists and planners and they would their 
studies involved economics of

40:54.668 --> 41:19.562
highway operations and so on even like with 
highway materials you were concerned about the

40:54.668 --> 41:19.562
energy costs of bringing aggregates from way off 
to a highway site

41:19.897 --> 41:27.832
and so on. And you started doing research to 
provide

41:27.852 --> 41:41.297
for aggregates to be used that were close at hand by 
thoroughly testing those lesser aggregates that

41:41.834 --> 41:59.421
weren't quite as satisfactory as those that we 
were hauling from farther away, and trying to

41:41.834 --> 41:59.421
determine whether you could actually use those, 
and under what conditions and so on, and what you

41:41.834 --> 41:59.421
needed to do to them. So we were energy conscious in 
all our research, yes. How did you get involved in

42:04.889 --> 42:10.137
Mr. Cotton's history of engineering? Because you 
wrote the chapter on teas. Oh, Professor

42:14.745 --> 42:16.707
Crawford's book. Yeah, Crawford, sorry. Oh, he 
just asked me to write those two chapters. He knew

42:23.875 --> 42:27.538
who it was and would know it, huh? Yes. Did it take a 
lot of digging, or did you pretty much remember?

42:31.983 --> 42:39.651
No, most of it I had my fingertips from working with 
the agencies through the years.

42:42.736 --> 42:48.784
Did you notice while you were working there a focus 
in the direction TEAS was going? Any change in that

42:48.864 --> 42:51.407
focus? The way TEAS was going? You know, the types 
of research they did?

43:00.519 --> 43:07.528
Well,

43:00.519 --> 43:07.528
there were various kinds of new interests always 
being established, and you would establish a

43:07.795 --> 43:14.584
center for that type of interest. And that is so you 
could deal with the outsiders a little better.

43:21.554 --> 43:29.084
They could find you in the maze of laboratories and 
people that was A&M. And by having a center, those

43:30.546 --> 43:34.832
people could find you a lot easier. but many of 
those centers started after I went over to the

43:35.504 --> 43:44.336
Institute. Do you remember a time period that you 
helped write proposals for grants and things? Do

43:51.204 --> 43:59.075
you remember a time that you felt like you were 
absolutely deluged with people wanting you to

43:51.204 --> 43:59.075
help them write grants and that type of thing? Was 
it any different than usual? Well, the man himself

44:01.238 --> 44:05.443
would... initiate the proposal, and most of the 
time you were just helping him. You were helping

44:11.034 --> 44:15.219
him with what he needed to do that. And so, I didn't 
mean to give the impression that I was writing all

44:15.239 --> 44:24.730
the proposals. Now the big ones, or the big 
facilities, a lot of people would write that. I

44:30.415 --> 44:38.208
wrecked those and I had a party in that. Were there 
any really big ones like those before the

44:38.228 --> 44:47.043
cyclotron and that type of thing? No.

44:58.107 --> 45:08.018
Up into the 60s, the Research Foundation, which 
handled those proposals, was a very small

44:58.107 --> 45:08.018
organization, just a few people. The Research 
Foundation was started by Dr. A. A. Jakula way

45:10.962 --> 45:14.606
back, and he just had a secretary. And then they 
moved up into the System Building, and there were,

45:15.287 --> 45:27.861
there was a director and a business officer, and 
then there were several secretaries, and then

45:29.545 --> 45:32.198
They added people, but the big,
