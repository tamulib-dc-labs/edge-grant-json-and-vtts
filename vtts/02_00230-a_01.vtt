00:01.381 --> 00:04.906
Today is April 30th, 1984.

00:06.348 --> 00:09.953
I'm interviewing Norman Borlaug at 4 p.m., Texas A&M University.

00:10.033 --> 00:14.800
This is a test.

00:14.820 --> 00:16.463
Okay, you run into problems.

00:16.483 --> 00:24.815
You run into problems about how do you get a factory, a plant established to produce these things?

00:24.935 --> 00:28.500
There you ran again into the order of priorities.

00:28.520 --> 00:30.763
What's the priority of this versus that?

00:31.115 --> 00:35.060
for a different branch of the armed forces or within the same branch.

00:38.825 --> 00:55.628
When DuPont saw that it had a broad coverage of insects also, they were interested, obviously, not only the immediate for the armed forces, but looking ahead to have something that would be useful in peacetime.

00:56.129 --> 01:00.835
So they tried to get approval for establishing commercial

01:01.169 --> 01:02.611
operation, no go.

01:05.054 --> 01:18.313
And so they, in the semi work, not enough, probably a whole series of things, not enough background data, no one was really convinced how good it was out there in the field.

01:18.333 --> 01:26.664
And then secondly, everybody's scrambling for something more important, the chemical equipment to run the reactions, to set up a special plan.

01:27.685 --> 01:30.990
And so it was, they started cooking it up

01:31.443 --> 01:41.239
and pretty crewed out in some semi-works in the old Grisele department's work in Cleveland, Ohio.

01:41.359 --> 01:52.317
In a few weeks' time, first a few small samples to make sure that it was toxic to insects, it was checked against a number of them.

01:52.337 --> 01:56.303
We also checked it on plants, and it'd kill everything.

01:57.650 --> 02:00.233
because it was full of other isomers.

02:00.573 --> 02:20.215
We didn't have good equipment to control the reactions and yet it was a very effective insecticide so they started cooking it up and about every week I think it was or every later I think it was down to every three days when a new bomber was leaving from this for the South Pacific.

02:20.903 --> 02:49.240
they would put in the 200 pounds I think was the maximum we were producing at that time in this and it was taken over and then diluted over there depending on how it was used whether it was added to solvents and used around and all the puddles where the where the malarial mosquitoes were probably used in many ways also dust

02:50.232 --> 02:59.963
I never saw the field operations, but it did a lot to cut back on disease.

03:01.145 --> 03:06.591
And as I say, that original crude product must have been a mixture of a lot of things.

03:07.132 --> 03:16.983
If the FDA or if the EPA had looked at it today, they never let it go onto the market, even for the military.

03:17.103 --> 03:17.944
That shows how

03:18.616 --> 03:21.722
The order of priorities changed with our fluency.

03:23.386 --> 03:26.632
What are the benefits against risk?

03:26.652 --> 03:28.857
There were all kinds of these kinds of problems.

03:30.780 --> 03:32.965
Even some that were hard to believe.

03:34.287 --> 03:39.959
One day, I'm not sure I should put this on the tape.

03:39.979 --> 03:40.540
Yes, you should.

03:41.701 --> 03:43.884
They even had bad bombers.

03:44.345 --> 03:50.594
I mean, they've had all kinds, and they've had balloons and all kinds of different types of experiments, and it's all public record now.

03:50.875 --> 04:04.755
Well, this had to do, not with anything of that kind, but somebody from quartermasters came in one day, another big box, and said, look at this, would you use these?

04:06.389 --> 04:09.772
He opened it up, and it was a box full of condoms.

04:10.673 --> 04:10.813
Really?

04:10.833 --> 04:19.140
Just covered with black molds, green molds, and all kinds of molds on the outside of the envelopes that they were in.

04:19.941 --> 04:25.526
And you opened them up, and they were also very often moldy.

04:26.847 --> 04:31.191
And before they opened, they said, don't laugh.

04:31.351 --> 04:32.593
This is serious business.

04:33.233 --> 04:33.373
Really?

04:33.393 --> 04:36.396
We've got a lot of our soldiers down.

04:36.595 --> 04:45.229
with venereal diseases of both kinds, the really severe one and also the more common one.

04:46.691 --> 04:48.935
And they said, would you use these?

04:51.058 --> 04:56.427
And of course there was some chuckling, but it was serious because of the numbers of people that perked.

04:57.132 --> 04:59.054
So, mold was growing on top?

04:59.074 --> 05:01.437
They wouldn't use them because the molds were there.

05:01.457 --> 05:03.619
You'd say, hell, that's worse than nothing.

05:04.180 --> 05:05.661
So, they wouldn't use them.

05:05.681 --> 05:06.642
They'd become infected.

05:06.922 --> 05:12.128
So, the problem says... So, would you have to do some kind of a packaging?

05:12.168 --> 05:13.129
Packaging.

05:13.149 --> 05:16.353
So, we had... So, mold wouldn't grow on the packages themselves.

05:16.913 --> 05:17.754
On the packaging.

05:17.774 --> 05:20.217
But as far as prophylactic were concerned... No, that was all right.

05:20.237 --> 05:22.799
Yeah, it was all right anyway because it was inside the package.

05:22.860 --> 05:23.760
Right.

05:23.780 --> 05:26.143
So, it was air tightened so that the molds weren't in there.

05:26.680 --> 05:29.444
And so we had packages all over in that jungle room.

05:29.804 --> 05:32.128
It looked like a Christmas tree.

05:33.310 --> 05:37.015
It's kind of embarrassing with all these young girls around there as technicians.

05:37.135 --> 05:39.218
You'd hear them go in and hear them chuckling.

05:40.320 --> 05:46.609
I remember the first morning when the girls came in, I put them all up over a weekend.

05:47.029 --> 05:56.603
We worked with the cellophane division, making all kinds of packaging, different plastics and different metallic covers and different kinds of seals.

05:57.764 --> 06:00.628
I had them all put up over a weekend.

06:00.648 --> 06:04.033
We used to work all hours at that time.

06:04.513 --> 06:06.136
That was part of the responsibility.

06:06.196 --> 06:09.200
We had these things pouring in, and we only had three of us.

06:09.881 --> 06:26.404
And so before the technicians came in that morning, I told this bacteriologist who was a middle-aged woman, considerably older than I was at that time, that had worked with Bachman, Betty Horning.

06:26.873 --> 06:28.996
This looks pretty horrible in there.

06:29.756 --> 06:31.038
She was a married woman.

06:31.058 --> 06:40.329
I said, you better explain this to these young girls, because if I do it, I won't be very comfortable, and I think you can do it there.

06:41.090 --> 06:47.858
And so she rounded him up, apparently, and explained what this was all about.

06:48.499 --> 06:53.505
For a couple of days, every time they'd open that door and go in, I'd hear them giggling in there.

06:54.380 --> 06:59.946
But the soldiers wouldn't use these because they were moldy on the, as far as wrappers were concerned.

07:00.186 --> 07:01.708
But they were perfectly good inside.

07:01.728 --> 07:04.791
Perfectly, okay.

07:04.831 --> 07:08.836
So I suppose we had a tremendous increase in the amount of mineral disease.

07:08.856 --> 07:09.036
Sure.

07:10.718 --> 07:12.560
We're soon to have that one fixed pretty soon.

07:12.880 --> 07:15.904
Yeah, I bet you that had top priority then, didn't it?

07:15.924 --> 07:16.665
Yes.

07:16.805 --> 07:17.285
Sure did.

07:17.806 --> 07:23.492
Now, they probably didn't experience those same problems over that type of mold in Europe, did they?

07:24.350 --> 07:31.481
No, I would imagine that the environmental conditions weren't right in Europe.

07:31.501 --> 07:33.624
It wasn't so human.

07:36.488 --> 07:38.131
What kind of baggage was it?

07:38.151 --> 07:40.114
I mean, was it some kind of a fabric?

07:40.695 --> 07:47.505
No, in the beginning they just had paper and they had some of the sealing agents didn't

07:47.924 --> 07:52.150
None of the sealing agents had fungicide or bactericides in them.

07:52.170 --> 07:57.919
And so the molds would frequently grow on the starch binding agents that were in the seals.

07:58.540 --> 07:59.902
It was kind of a culture medium.

08:02.305 --> 08:07.233
But we soon decided that in that particular case, we had to do something.

08:07.914 --> 08:12.180
Ah, that's where cellulose acetate in part came into the picture.

08:12.461 --> 08:16.767
I'd forgotten the one that the molds wouldn't grow on.

08:17.033 --> 08:22.238
It's like cellophane, but it has the acetate part of the molecule.

08:22.798 --> 08:24.480
And the moles wouldn't grow on it.

08:24.500 --> 08:26.021
And that you could seal with heat.

08:28.223 --> 08:30.165
I'd forgotten what we did that for.

08:31.486 --> 08:32.346
That's interesting.

08:32.507 --> 08:36.570
I'm surprised that they didn't use some kind of a, I'm surprised that they used paper.

08:37.611 --> 08:38.612
Something to deal with paper.

08:38.632 --> 08:39.573
Well, you couldn't get anything.

08:39.793 --> 08:41.394
Yeah, because of the priorities.

08:41.474 --> 08:42.295
Priorities, yeah.

08:45.458 --> 08:45.538
Hmm.

08:46.312 --> 08:47.273
That is interesting.

08:47.293 --> 08:48.675
How about water purification?

08:49.697 --> 08:56.507
Well, they had certain, and again, I've forgotten the time.

08:56.947 --> 09:09.765
Betty Horning was a specialist in this, because before she took her doctorate with Waxman out at Rutgers, she had worked for several years when her husband, he was also a DuPont employee in the cellophane division, chemist.

09:10.827 --> 09:14.412
But she was a trained microbiologist, bacteriologist.

09:14.847 --> 09:29.873
She had done a lot of work with the company that made the equipment to chlorinate public drinking water system.

09:29.893 --> 09:38.188
She had a vast amount of experience, so she was brought in.

09:39.856 --> 09:41.017
We had certain guidelines.

09:42.078 --> 09:48.364
The military said you have to have a disinfection that will work in, I think it was five minutes.

09:49.085 --> 09:54.290
The concentration has to be high enough so that it'll work in five minutes.

09:54.310 --> 09:57.332
In other words, you fill your canteen, maybe the guy will wait five minutes.

09:59.574 --> 10:01.116
This way I remember it, five minutes.

10:01.156 --> 10:07.602
Anyway, it was a very short period of time, so you'd have to go through dilutions and different chemicals and whatnot.

10:07.970 --> 10:26.839
And we had at that time also, as all of this work was going on, to the best of our ability, we had a toxicological laboratory, but obviously you couldn't run tests like they do today that you run repeatedly over months and years of time to come up with some general conclusion.

10:26.859 --> 10:28.601
What was happening meanwhile?

10:28.621 --> 10:29.743
That was the basis.

10:30.204 --> 10:35.091
And you'd make some, the best test you could with rapid judgment.

10:36.910 --> 10:57.308
That's why I think I get up pretty tight when I hear all of the tremendous tests that go on now to evaluate toxicity and carcinogenicity and teratogenicity of compounds.

10:58.429 --> 11:05.095
And one other great thing that has happened since then that's confused rather than enlightened,

11:05.598 --> 11:09.503
the way these results are put out to the general public.

11:10.224 --> 11:18.175
At that time, for most compounds, the analytical procedures, if you could measure one part per 100,000, it was good.

11:18.936 --> 11:26.185
Of course, today, one part per billion you can measure very easily, or a fraction of a part per billion, or one part per trillion.

11:26.586 --> 11:27.307
Really?

11:27.487 --> 11:29.530
You can measure it that well, one part per trillion?

11:29.550 --> 11:32.634
Well, let's say several parts per trillion.

11:32.654 --> 11:35.217
But one part per billion you can measure.

11:36.260 --> 11:57.570
And this means that, for example, in many of the toxicants, including some which are known to be carcinogenic in certain levels, they are present in the plants that we have been using from way back before written history.

12:00.054 --> 12:00.555
They are there.

12:01.957 --> 12:05.001
We've been using them, but at the levels that they are

12:05.504 --> 12:34.667
present in our food they're apparently innocuous although maybe so small but maybe with time we'll find out that some of them are weak well we know some of them are carcinogenic at certain levels in test animals it's sort of bewildering and frightening to me now having worked for all of these years in control of diseases of our main crop plants that

12:35.997 --> 12:55.159
There exists on the record, under the Food and Drug Administration Act, a clause which is commonly known as GRAS, G-R-A-S, generally recognized as safe.

12:56.641 --> 13:04.370
And an improved variety of crop plants that's put out as disease resistant falls under that category.

13:04.410 --> 13:05.852
It's never been

13:06.642 --> 13:11.969
question so far as to why it's resistant.

13:11.989 --> 13:23.104
Almost certainly there's something in there that's toxic to the primary pathogen that normally attacks that crop species, let's say the rust fungus.

13:24.906 --> 13:33.898
And then under this gloss called the Delaney gloss, which was hooked on in 1958, I believe it was,

13:34.807 --> 13:51.962
to the Food and Drug Administration General Act that's controlled additives in food, or now it's interpreted also as contaminants in food.

13:52.083 --> 13:53.083
Thirty-seven words.

13:53.324 --> 14:02.552
It was hooked on an appropriation bill in the last hours or so before Congress was closing, which says, in effect, paraphrasing,

14:03.072 --> 14:24.758
Any compound that's added to foods, which in any quantity can be shown to be carcinogenic, when used on experimental animals with appropriate procedures, whether given orally or by injection, has to be banned.

14:24.778 --> 14:26.200
It's not a question of judgment.

14:26.320 --> 14:30.565
That's the responsibility of the administrator of the Food and Drug Act.

14:31.017 --> 14:47.733
Well, this is the one that's led to all of this furore that we read about now that something is removed because the issue boils down as to what is a reasonable, what is a reasonable risk.

14:49.214 --> 14:58.543
And I see unless that this is modified, it won't be too long before somebody says, look, that new variety you have put out,

14:59.975 --> 15:01.797
has to have something toxic in it.

15:01.897 --> 15:11.306
It's probably carcinogenic and it's up to you to prove that it's not before you can have this variety released for distribution to protect the farmer's crop.

15:11.326 --> 15:19.073
We don't even know what the compounds are, much less the quantities that are in them.

15:19.093 --> 15:26.860
And so this probably explains why I feel so frustrated with some of these

15:28.426 --> 15:38.576
judgments that I feel are over-exaggerated, simplified procedures in banning the use of certain things.

15:40.698 --> 15:43.500
It started all out with DDT, if you will remember.

15:43.661 --> 15:44.862
Yeah, but we're going to get to this.

15:45.582 --> 15:56.593
But it goes all down through cyclamates and the whole gamut of things into the most recent one was ethylene dibromide.

15:58.632 --> 16:00.535
about two months ago.

16:00.895 --> 16:02.577
Well, dioxins are a part of this.

16:03.459 --> 16:19.060
Now, some of them aren't added as the Delaney clause was specifically drafted to say as food additives, but they are contaminants, whether it's as a pesticide or whether it comes in in some other way.

16:20.101 --> 16:21.222
Well, let's get back to the war.

16:21.363 --> 16:25.268
I want to ask you another question about the war because we are going to cover all of that.

16:25.288 --> 16:28.352
And that is, you know, during the war, it was a tremendous...

16:28.737 --> 16:38.430
tremendous period of American patriotism and to be in uniform was, well, every account I read was the thing.

16:38.951 --> 16:43.577
And did you ever feel that you were sort of out of the mainstream because you weren't in the service?

16:43.597 --> 16:43.838
Yes.

16:44.859 --> 16:57.917
I think that this was definitely the case, especially when I would travel to go to military laboratories or installations, the Quartermaster Depot or down to

16:58.673 --> 17:15.531
Washington, on different occasions, talking about this is the product that looks like it might solve at the quartermaster general's office or whatever the agency of the armed forces was that we were dealing with.

17:16.412 --> 17:18.134
You felt sort of out of place.

17:18.654 --> 17:25.862
While you were back at DuPont, it wasn't necessarily so, because there were a considerable number of military-aged scientists

17:25.977 --> 17:28.880
that were under war manpower control just as I was.

17:28.940 --> 17:40.553
We couldn't leave because that had a higher priority than going into the Army as a private, as far as our War Manpower Commission is concerned.

17:41.294 --> 17:44.157
But it was kind of a nasty feeling.

17:46.980 --> 17:49.803
Which leads me to the next question then.

17:49.823 --> 17:53.267
If you couldn't join the service,

17:53.669 --> 17:56.934
And you were supposed to stay in DuPont.

17:56.954 --> 17:58.636
How did you leave?

17:58.656 --> 17:59.377
Before the war was over.

17:59.457 --> 18:04.665
How did you get down to Mexico, which was the next part of your career?

18:05.085 --> 18:22.630
I suppose it was in... When the American Phytopathological Society was holding their annual meeting, it was in Philadelphia that year, which is only a stone's throw from Wilmington, Delaware, where I was based with the DuPont Company.

18:23.453 --> 18:27.196
And I don't remember the month of the year.

18:27.277 --> 18:31.621
It may have been October or the fall of the year, at least.

18:31.641 --> 18:37.106
So one afternoon after work, I went down, or maybe at midday even.

18:37.606 --> 18:39.588
The pond company may have told me to go.

18:39.788 --> 18:40.469
I don't remember.

18:40.529 --> 18:42.250
But anyway, I was there in the afternoon.

18:43.091 --> 18:51.739
And as the session broke up, someone came to me.

18:52.158 --> 18:54.020
who turned out to be Dr. J.G.

18:54.340 --> 19:00.727
George Harrar, whom I had not known at Minnesota.

19:00.747 --> 19:08.556
He had left, finished his doctor, under Dr. Stakeman, while I was an undergraduate, so I hadn't known him.

19:08.576 --> 19:14.863
I knew a lot about him because he was quite a famous personality around the graduate school.

19:14.883 --> 19:17.946
And he said, look, how about joining our staff?

19:18.147 --> 19:21.270
We're just getting ready to start a

19:22.955 --> 19:27.100
Foreign Technical Agricultural Program January 1 of 73.

19:27.120 --> 19:28.501
Yeah, 73.

19:28.521 --> 19:36.410
And I say, I can't.

19:38.212 --> 19:39.793
I'm under war manpower.

19:40.494 --> 19:41.615
43, excuse me.

19:42.336 --> 19:43.578
Only off by 40 years.

19:46.941 --> 19:47.242
I can't.

19:47.462 --> 19:48.523
I'm under war manpower.

19:49.111 --> 19:52.836
Until I'm released for more manpower, I have no choice.

19:52.936 --> 19:55.881
I stay here, and this is in lieu of military service.

19:57.002 --> 20:02.490
And if I break my part of the good faith that I should go, then I'll be put in the military.

20:04.012 --> 20:05.294
But I said, I'm interested.

20:05.875 --> 20:07.297
I'd like to know something about it.

20:07.357 --> 20:10.882
And he very generally explained this program.

20:12.003 --> 20:16.670
And I guess we're going to talk about how this came to be at some point here in this interview.

20:17.391 --> 20:19.033
So I simply told him that I can't.

20:19.638 --> 20:25.464
But I'd be interested to, once I'm released, I don't know whether I'll stay at DuPont Company.

20:25.504 --> 20:26.746
They've been very kind to me.

20:28.007 --> 20:29.188
But there were certain things.

20:29.429 --> 20:32.973
It wasn't all gravy on this war manpower thing.

20:33.013 --> 20:39.300
For example, the new people who came into my staff, by the time I was released, more manpower.

20:40.821 --> 20:46.067
For example, Betty Horning, this woman, and another person who had a 4F.

20:46.621 --> 20:52.330
Their salary was twice as much as I was getting, who was director of the laboratory.

20:52.350 --> 20:53.371
And this was big.

20:53.391 --> 21:01.224
This was understandable because all salaries were frozen as of Pearl Harbor Day.

21:03.287 --> 21:07.313
And the only increases that were permitted was if you worked more hours.

21:08.314 --> 21:12.561
I think once we went from whatever it was, 40 to 48 hours.

21:12.811 --> 21:16.695
So they were controlled by the Office of Price Administration.

21:16.715 --> 21:17.516
That whole thing.

21:17.536 --> 21:18.117
Federal government, sure.

21:18.137 --> 21:18.838
Federal government.

21:19.699 --> 21:20.139
Everybody.

21:20.439 --> 21:21.481
Yeah.

21:21.501 --> 21:40.502
And so, and then I also, by then I'd looked around in this company and I'd worked on, in some of their plant operation where they had biological problems and their paint division and their lactic acid.

21:40.522 --> 21:42.784
They used to produce lactic acid for,

21:43.388 --> 22:09.658
for food by fermentation and I thought that was kind of a primitive operation and I saw lots of things that I would like to have been involved in and I saw the field opening up on antibiotics before it really got big and I tried to get the DuPont company to get interested in this whole penicillin thing was just opening up.

22:10.379 --> 22:12.822
DuPont was never in pharmaceuticals but

22:13.392 --> 22:30.807
Anything that showed biological activity in our kinds of tests for industrial purposes was automatically through some arrangement with Abbott chemicals, pharmaceutical, would be tested by them in small samples.

22:30.827 --> 22:36.451
But I didn't feel that this was a very good arrangement with the field opening up in antibiotics.

22:37.032 --> 22:43.197
Since I knew a lot about microorganisms and since most of these new ones were in the field of

22:43.818 --> 23:04.527
where fungal activity was involved and especially since we had Betty Horning who had just finished her doctorate thesis with Selmer Wachsman at Rutgers who was one of the authorities and produced several of the really famous or was producing them at that time.

23:04.928 --> 23:10.095
I thought we had a natural good position but they figured that

23:11.341 --> 23:15.946
With the limited manpower, we weren't in any position to do this.

23:16.006 --> 23:28.698
So I was kind of frustrated by these things and yet recognized that under the circumstances, you couldn't expect the company to do anything about this at that time.

23:29.919 --> 23:39.829
So long came, I've forgotten when it was, July or August 1st, somewhere in there.

23:40.383 --> 23:40.723
of 73.

23:40.743 --> 23:41.184
43.

23:41.204 --> 23:46.329
I seem to simply add the seven.

23:48.612 --> 24:01.065
I got a notice from, or rather my directors got a notice, that I and several other people of military age were being released by war and manpower.

24:03.788 --> 24:06.171
It didn't show on the

24:08.378 --> 24:13.464
This was not played up in the public press, but this was obvious.

24:13.884 --> 24:33.866
And we had seen for several weeks before that military contracts that we had sort of been acting as technical consultants for in the military operations, whether it was with camouflage paints or with many of these things I've mentioned, suddenly they didn't call us anymore.

24:34.767 --> 24:36.529
There were no more production.

24:36.931 --> 24:38.453
They apparently had enough produced.

24:39.394 --> 24:44.141
They could see the end of the war coming as far as procurement was concerned.

24:45.843 --> 24:51.871
But it was several weeks after that before a notice came down that we were released from war manpower.

24:53.273 --> 24:54.715
Already in 43?

24:54.795 --> 25:01.444
That seems kind of early, doesn't it?

25:01.464 --> 25:02.045
No, wait a little.

25:02.065 --> 25:02.606
I'm off a year.

25:02.626 --> 25:05.149
44.

25:05.905 --> 25:07.007
Excuse me, 44.

25:07.027 --> 25:08.910
Yeah, seems kind of strange.

25:08.970 --> 25:15.099
July 1st, July 1st, or... So it's after D-Day.

25:15.119 --> 25:23.752
After... Yeah, which is June 6th, and the Japanese are moving backwards, too.

25:24.553 --> 25:27.157
They're withdrawing, yeah.

25:27.177 --> 25:30.082
Yes, yeah.

25:30.102 --> 25:33.567
And... So then I...

25:34.627 --> 25:36.169
Herrar contacted me again.

25:36.850 --> 25:39.092
He was in New York for budget meeting.

25:39.112 --> 25:40.834
And he hadn't talked to you then for about a year.

25:41.455 --> 25:42.857
That's right.

25:42.877 --> 25:48.944
And he said, can you come up to New York?

25:48.964 --> 25:58.795
And I should have said that the foundation, before this, after that first meeting, Herrar came down and one of the

25:59.450 --> 26:19.714
the head of the Natural Science Division of the Foundation came down and talked to DuPont about whether I could be released, and they were told in no uncertain terms that no one could be released under these circumstances to go, no matter how high a priority this may affect.

26:19.734 --> 26:22.117
And if you would have been released, you probably would have been drafted.

26:22.298 --> 26:22.718
Exactly.

26:23.339 --> 26:28.545
And this was made very clear, and rightfully so.

26:28.728 --> 26:37.940
So then, more than a year later, this would have been whatever it was, December until a year and a half later.

26:41.205 --> 26:48.715
Then the notice came down, and apparently this was noticed by Herrera when he was in New York, and he called and he said, can you come up?

26:49.936 --> 26:55.123
And so we had never had any vacation all during these days.

26:55.880 --> 26:59.887
four years, so I took a half a day off or whatever it was and went up.

27:00.929 --> 27:05.257
And they asked me whether I would be interested in joining this program.

27:06.319 --> 27:08.162
And I said, well, I'll have to think about it.

27:08.663 --> 27:14.794
At that time, there was only one other person who had just then been hired, Dr. Wellhausen.

27:15.134 --> 27:19.542
Herrar, the chief in Wellhausen.

27:21.428 --> 27:28.356
I said, well, I'll have to talk to my wife and think about it for a while, which I did.

27:28.396 --> 27:39.669
And so I decided to, after cogitating, first I talked to my superiors in Dupont.

27:39.689 --> 27:45.055
I said, this has come, inquiry whether I'd be interested.

27:46.316 --> 27:49.900
And I said, I'm kind of interested because of the fact that

27:50.656 --> 27:53.420
I'm not sure where I'm going to fit in this chemical company.

27:53.840 --> 27:59.608
I'm one of the few microbiologists that's here in this big chemical company.

28:00.228 --> 28:02.331
And what kind of future do I have?

28:02.371 --> 28:08.419
I'm not sure that there's much here for me because the agricultural chemicals was still not developed at that time.

28:08.439 --> 28:12.244
It was just in its infancy.

28:14.327 --> 28:19.093
And the director of research called me into his office and he said, look,

28:19.934 --> 28:26.321
He says, you've done a good job here, not on what you were hired for, but we want you to feel comfortable.

28:27.082 --> 28:46.363
And if you feel that way, considering how you've worked, and they actually showed me that I was one of two cases in DuPont where we had been at the same salary from pre-Pearl Harbor with no adjustments.

28:46.867 --> 28:58.903
There were two of us that was sent as test cases to war manpower and they were told in both cases, no, we don't make any exceptions because this is the way it has to be.

28:58.923 --> 29:08.396
As soon as we start making exceptions, no matter how well justified, then the fence is down.

29:09.978 --> 29:10.759
I knew about this.

29:10.940 --> 29:15.726
They said, recognizing this and

29:17.022 --> 29:26.093
They pulled out the letters again to confirm that I had not read the letters, but my immediate chief had told me about it.

29:27.074 --> 29:39.570
That this is the way they felt, and that if I felt this way about being inadequate in chemistry, having worked at this salary scale

29:40.158 --> 29:42.180
for this time and lots of extra hours.

29:42.761 --> 29:55.335
They would give me two afternoons a week at company expense to go to the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, it's only about 30 months away, to take additional chemistry work.

29:55.355 --> 30:00.501
And that put me in a worse dilemma because I thought it was very fair.

30:01.502 --> 30:05.867
And so then, what to do?

30:07.709 --> 30:09.591
And so I called my

30:09.908 --> 30:23.642
ex-professor Dr. Easy's statement one night, and I said, I explained both sides of this issue to him, and I said, what do I do?

30:26.705 --> 30:36.034
He says, Norm, and he knew me pretty well, he says, I think you should have a good look

30:36.554 --> 30:37.796
at that Mexican thing.

30:37.956 --> 30:39.298
This is a new operation.

30:39.358 --> 30:41.120
There's never been one like it before.

30:41.761 --> 30:51.473
You've got the right combination of broad background here from the farm to forestry to chemical industry, plant pathology, genetics.

30:52.435 --> 31:04.350
He said this kind of background that we need in the early pioneers, this kind of a program combined with the personality to get along with people.

31:06.119 --> 31:11.167
I said, I don't know a word of Spanish, I've never seen Mexico.

31:12.268 --> 31:31.637
He says, well, I'll tell you one thing, even though you don't know him well, Dr. George Harar is one of the best students that I ever had contact with, and he knows how to make things happen, and if he offers you this job,

31:32.528 --> 31:35.451
I think you should go because I think this thing is going to go."

31:35.931 --> 31:51.587
And he says, as a matter of fact, I was one of the three who made that survey and I was chairman of that feasibility study that was made in Mexico that decided to recommend to the foundation to establish such a program.

31:51.607 --> 32:00.055
And so I left DuPont and the last days of

32:02.195 --> 32:08.541
October, or the last days of September, and drove to Mexico.

32:08.622 --> 32:15.649
My wife, Jeannie, who was a year a little older than that, stayed in Wilmington.

32:15.669 --> 32:16.289
Your daughter?

32:16.309 --> 32:16.590
Yes.

32:18.572 --> 32:24.878
Because Margaret was pregnant and expecting another youngster soon.

32:27.040 --> 32:30.784
I remember vividly driving down the Shenandoah Valley in

32:32.013 --> 32:41.005
These last days, the color was early that year, the beautiful foliage colors, which reminded me of my forestry days in New England.

32:41.025 --> 32:43.909
It was a beautiful drive.

32:43.949 --> 32:51.279
When I crossed the border into the unknown world of Mexico, I was met there and drove on down to Mexico City.

32:51.319 --> 32:56.586
That's where I spent, in one way or another, the next 40 years of my life.

32:57.005 --> 33:01.692
frustrations in the early years were very great before we could see progress.

33:02.533 --> 33:15.773
I often wondered why I was so stupid to accept the job because I couldn't see any progress at all during the first three or four years, only problems everywhere.

33:17.596 --> 33:22.523
Frustrations, inability to handle the language,

33:23.414 --> 33:25.757
all kinds of things, no equipment.

33:25.777 --> 33:28.000
We couldn't buy cultural problems.

33:30.784 --> 33:39.955
We couldn't buy any scientific equipment, wasn't available because the war was in its waning days, but nonetheless was still there.

33:39.975 --> 33:45.663
And so that's how I got to Mexico.

33:45.763 --> 33:52.071
I was the last one who was hired to the post without ever seeing the job first.

33:53.722 --> 33:57.829
Wellhausen and I were the only two, and we stayed longer than any of the others.

33:58.030 --> 34:00.574
So you had three people there basically when you were hired?

34:00.594 --> 34:08.929
There was another one hired about the same time, Bill Caldwell, agronomist, soil scientist, but he only stayed less than a year.

34:09.382 --> 34:12.886
And so I worked with both Wellhausen and he and with Arrar.

34:13.567 --> 34:23.217
I was a kind of a jack of all trades in those early times and master of none until I was permanently assigned to the wheat program about a year later.

34:23.758 --> 34:27.101
Okay, well let's stop here and we have to start talking.

34:27.122 --> 34:27.902
Remember where we were?

34:28.002 --> 34:30.725
We were just at the beginning.

34:31.266 --> 34:32.047
I should start out.

34:32.067 --> 34:37.913
Today is May 2nd, 1984.

34:38.374 --> 34:38.494
Right.

34:39.267 --> 34:54.262
Norman Borlaug and I are talking about how the Rockefeller Foundation got involved with food production, the Mexican government, which really is a question dealing with the rise of the foreign technical assistance programs in the United States.

34:54.523 --> 35:02.411
That's about where we should start today because we were right at the junction last time where you went down to Mexico.

35:02.431 --> 35:08.717
Okay, it has its origins in

35:09.608 --> 35:39.177
1940 in 19 the December 1st 1940 Henry A. Wallace president or vice president elect under Franklin D. Roosevelt yeah was asked to represent the US government at the inauguration inaugural ceremonies the incoming president of Mexico Manuel Avila Camacho you will remember that

35:39.545 --> 35:51.804
Wallace had served two terms as Secretary of Agriculture, and he came from a strong agricultural background of editor, the Wallace farmer and publisher, which was at Farm Weekly.

35:52.585 --> 36:00.738
In addition, he was the founder of the Pioneer Hybrid Seed Company, which later also went into hybrid chicks and a lot of other crops.

36:02.020 --> 36:04.303
So he was well known for his

36:05.313 --> 36:34.324
abilities knowledge in agriculture following the ceremonies he was invited to visit the old parts of Mexico where agriculture goes back to colonial times and maybe even beyond to the Aztec or before the invitation was made through incoming secretary of agriculture Martieri Gomez who was a agronomist but mostly on the side of the social aspects of agriculture

36:34.726 --> 36:38.012
and the outgoing president, Lázaro Cárdenas.

36:39.294 --> 36:42.659
Both of these people are deceased at present.

36:42.980 --> 36:44.763
It's Wallace, of course.

36:44.783 --> 36:52.496
And they traveled the countryside for several days, especially in the Bahía region, in the high valleys.

36:52.516 --> 37:00.750
And they requested from the US government an assistance to train young Mexican scientists.

37:01.439 --> 37:15.494
establish network of agricultural experiment stations to do basic or to do research necessary to increase production yield on the three basic food crops corn wheat and beans.

37:18.217 --> 37:28.868
This request was made personally to Wallace but formally after the trip in Mexico City in the presence of U.S.

37:28.928 --> 37:30.670
Ambassador Joseph Daniels

37:31.628 --> 38:00.724
this is some of this background but perhaps not in this detail is available in that book written by a statement Bradfield and Mangelsdorf Conquest Campaigns Against Hunger okay and there's Harvard Press and I think there's at least one copy over in the library there may be I'm not sure of that but it will give some of the early period

38:01.582 --> 38:03.425
I'm giving a bit more detail.

38:04.647 --> 38:05.789
Howard Press 1967.

38:05.809 --> 38:06.690
Yeah.

38:07.672 --> 38:11.338
So he took this under consideration.

38:11.398 --> 38:12.660
He went back to Washington.

38:15.224 --> 38:23.918
In order to put it into perspective you have to remember that the war clouds of World War II were already on the horizon.

38:24.439 --> 38:24.739
Yeah.

38:24.980 --> 38:28.365
The reserve officers were being called up.

38:28.852 --> 38:57.171
Wallace recognized that there would have to be a special appropriations bill for such a program to go through Congress and it wasn't likely it would happen with the war on the horizon and especially with reserve officers quite a few of them agricultural scientists being called called up and so shortly later he talked to the president then of the Rockefeller Foundation

38:58.028 --> 39:00.110
Dr. Raymond Fosdick.

39:00.130 --> 39:01.712
And he said, this request has come.

39:03.073 --> 39:07.297
I don't think that the US government can respond to it under the present situation.

39:07.377 --> 39:11.882
And perhaps it's better that you, as a foundation, should in any case for two reasons.

39:12.602 --> 39:16.566
One, you have worked for 25 years with quite a number of governments.

39:16.646 --> 39:27.377
I think it was something on the order of 25 different governments and developing countries, especially tropics and subtropics, on diseases, human diseases.

39:27.779 --> 39:34.866
You've sent out a number of MDs who are specialized specialists in vector-borne diseases.

39:35.267 --> 39:50.542
You've sent out medical entomologists who know a lot about the vectors, and you've sent out sanitation engineers for setting up purified water systems and sewage disposal, and you've had considerable influence.

39:51.463 --> 39:56.588
And you know how to operate with governments, which we wouldn't have that, and

39:57.277 --> 40:09.599
addition you're apolitical so he said I think you should look into this and so I'm not sure exactly how many weeks later but the next summer in 71 Dr. E.C.

40:09.779 --> 40:19.897
Stakeman who was the professor 41 I keep saying 70 Dr. E.C.

40:19.937 --> 40:21.360
Stakeman

40:22.049 --> 40:51.347
who was professor of plant pathology and had an international reputation was also a great linguist this was why he sort of headed the thing because he spoke Spanish he visited Mexico many times collecting rust specimens that infect our grain crops here in the states he'd done that for 20 years or more and Dr. Paul Mangelsdorf who originally was a corn scientist here at Texas A&M but shortly before that had gone to Harvard as the director of the botanical library

40:51.749 --> 41:16.643
scientist of great repute also and it has a geneticist and plant breeder and then Dr. Richard Bradfield a soil agronomist specialist then head of the department of soils and agronomy at Cornell University originally from Ohio State they were the three who went to Mexico and they stayed I think about three months in the summer of 41 and made the survey

41:17.315 --> 41:22.701
It was pretty primitive, as you can see from some of those pictures in that book that I've referred to.

41:22.741 --> 41:40.199
They got back, wrote the report, and they suggested that the Rockefeller Foundation look into establishing a small program, sending out a few scientists in the basic disciplines that affected production of those crops.

41:41.160 --> 41:46.326
The program was launched with Dr. J. G. Harrar.

41:47.133 --> 41:55.480
in early 1943, and Dr. Wellhausen was the second person who joined that staff.

41:55.540 --> 41:57.121
He was a corn breeder.

41:57.141 --> 42:16.718
Let me say that Herrera was originally trained at Oberlin in general biology, took his master's degree at Iowa State in ecology, I believe, and then he's a doctorate in plant pathology under Dr. Stakeman in Minnesota.

42:17.440 --> 42:23.410
He went to University of Puerto Rico and taught botany, and so he was fluent in Spanish.

42:24.973 --> 42:40.360
Later he moved on to become head of the Department of Plant Pathology at VPI, Virginia Polytech, and then Washington State, and he came from Washington State to the Rockefeller program as the director, and Dr. Wellhausen

42:40.728 --> 43:02.734
was born in Oklahoma before it was a state, I think, or about that time, and they moved to Idaho, grew up on an irrigated farm there, studied at the University of Idaho, and took his doctorate and mastered and doctored at Iowa State, a very good corn breeder.

43:03.254 --> 43:05.457
He came to Mexico from West Virginia.

43:05.657 --> 43:09.722
He had previously been on the corn program in Montana,

43:10.394 --> 43:13.578
then Virginia then Mexico.

43:16.180 --> 43:29.595
Bill Caldwell joined shortly before I did he was an agronomy and soil scientist but he stayed very only a short period and went back and I joined in 43 after I was released from war.

43:29.735 --> 43:30.616
No 44.

43:30.636 --> 43:33.900
44 excuse me the program started in 43.

43:34.100 --> 43:35.862
Yeah now tell me about the program

43:36.314 --> 43:37.956
Tell me about the program.

43:38.096 --> 43:41.701
What did they, what were the very first things that they did before you got there?

43:42.562 --> 43:44.264
First of all, the corn program.

43:45.345 --> 43:49.610
Is it function?

43:50.031 --> 43:51.933
Yeah, it's going.

43:52.294 --> 43:56.259
In the corn program, let me remove some of that garbage.

43:56.439 --> 43:57.240
No, that's okay.

43:58.441 --> 44:03.047
In the corn program, the first thing Dr. Wellhausen did was to, he got some young people

44:03.601 --> 44:14.972
students who were assigned to him or they were recent graduates and he sent them out to collect all of the types of corn on farms or in markets that he could find, all of the diverse types.

44:15.192 --> 44:29.106
Now tell me about, were these Mexican students, they were graduates from like the University of Mexico or a technical... The program was perceived as a training program in part and so young graduates fresh out of school, many had never worked on the land.

44:29.686 --> 44:32.629
They came from urban families.

44:33.200 --> 44:47.155
were assigned to us by the Mexican government, and sometimes their basic salary was paid by the Mexican Department of Agriculture sometime out of our direct budget.

44:47.175 --> 44:56.645
These young people, Wellhausen sent out to collect corn, he worked with them as best he could, with the limitations on time, because you had to start lots of things at the same time.

44:57.766 --> 45:02.751
Herrera started collecting, through Stakeman and others, samples of wheat,

45:03.322 --> 45:05.064
from different parts of the world.

45:06.426 --> 45:11.173
They had not collected the native wheats at the time when I arrived.

45:11.413 --> 45:13.056
The Mexican wheats, yeah.

45:13.196 --> 45:25.493
And Mexico was probably one of the first places, maybe Peru also, where wheat was introduced from the old world and later we saw some very old types which we collected.

45:26.074 --> 45:27.456
Okay,

45:28.567 --> 45:30.510
So these activities were going on.

45:30.830 --> 45:50.699
The first year in 44 was the first time they made any experimental plantings on Campo Experimental, El Orno, H-O-R-N-O, which was the land of the National College of Agriculture, Chapingo, land that had not been used.

45:50.719 --> 45:55.266
It was grown up to weeds, and so part of it was plowed and

45:55.786 --> 46:00.463
We didn't have equipment to level with hardly any equipment.

46:02.129 --> 46:04.277
It was miserable.
