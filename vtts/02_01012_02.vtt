WEBVTT

00:09.481 --> 00:14.187
It

00:09.481 --> 00:14.187
was easy to defend that base. It was a real good base 
to be on at any time of year. That was our main base of

00:18.131 --> 00:22.577
operation. We spent half our time probably there, 
but it was a good base to be at because it was so

00:22.597 --> 00:30.286
secure and they had bean shoes there. And that's 
some of the things that people

00:31.267 --> 00:52.395
want to see the movies, probably don't realize 
that when you get all of a sudden to be in a place

00:31.267 --> 00:52.395
where you can completely get used to, at the 
futures, you know, at the clubs, you know, you go

00:31.267 --> 00:52.395
back, you know, and stuff, and yet, you know, the 
next day you put back on a shop or go somewhere that,

00:31.267 --> 00:52.395
you know, just completely opposite. So... The

00:52.495 --> 01:08.452
main

00:52.495 --> 01:08.452
base has been pretty well protected. It's just 
that they could always hit them with rockets or

01:08.472 --> 01:15.400
mortars, except for the podium channel I made on, 
like I said. Supposedly, I read about it again, but

01:15.420 --> 01:16.881
that one was a good base to be on. So how much slot 
time did you have? Oh, probably about half the time

01:17.622 --> 01:18.563
we were there. It was not on any type of direct 
operation. And then, even when you're on an

01:19.464 --> 01:20.325
operation, As

01:21.115 --> 01:44.478
I said, you know, a lot of it turned out to be not 
productive from a military standpoint. So

01:44.498 --> 01:45.980
overall, it wasn't like that was a day of conflict 
and a day of threat. It wasn't like that. From my

01:46.420 --> 01:48.422
point of view, it wasn't as bad as, I'm sure, on the 
radio, it's not on the radio like this. Again,

01:48.824 --> 02:11.096
a lot worse, a lot more often. Did you know anybody 
that was like that, that had that? Oh, yeah. Some of

02:12.438 --> 02:12.819
my friends. One of the things I had to do in high 
school when I came to the first one in my class, they

02:12.839 --> 02:14.962
would kill me. I was very young. I had to get a 
telephone out there. As a matter of fact, while I

02:16.063 --> 02:17.826
was training in Florida to go over, I had 12 home 
attempts. I had to take care of the children. So,

02:18.567 --> 02:18.747
yeah. Six

02:20.802 --> 02:43.685
or nine

02:20.802 --> 02:43.685
of

02:20.802 --> 02:43.685
my classmates in that class were about 190 kids. 
Six of them were killed. How has all of this

02:44.205 --> 02:45.066
affected your life now? Overall, I probably came 
more personally out of it than come out of it. I just

02:46.527 --> 02:48.109
think I have a really good chance of people in terms 
of life in general. I

02:48.730 --> 03:07.530
just have great appreciation for the things that 
you have done for me. I honestly, I don't, I wasn't

03:07.550 --> 03:09.872
scarred, but I know physically, so I don't know if I 
can have a good impact on people. But obviously, I

03:09.892 --> 03:11.895
would recommend that everybody has to do their own 
work to better their own person. I've heard, I've

03:11.915 --> 03:12.375
heard, So

03:13.351 --> 03:32.440
how do you feel about, say, the typical portrayal 
of the Vietnam vet who came home and went crazy,

03:13.351 --> 03:32.440
who's shooting people and... That's probably,

03:33.618 --> 03:51.525
you know, an exaggeration. I mean, I'm sure it is 
something that happens, but I don't think

03:51.545 --> 03:55.030
everybody should perceive it, you know, that 
there's a lot of time, a lot of pressure, you know,

03:51.545 --> 03:55.030
and killing. But like I say, I'm sure that people 
have had experiences that were a lot more severe.

03:57.597 --> 04:21.042
you

03:57.597 --> 04:21.042
know, that they probably does have some of that 
impact on, you see, I was fortunate that the combat

03:57.597 --> 04:21.042
encounters that I did have were a lot less public 
and severe to what some of these people were trying

03:57.597 --> 04:21.042
to throw me. We had casualties, but I had to deal 
with the chaos and everything that goes around.

04:23.298 --> 04:41.052
It's

04:23.298 --> 04:41.052
just hiding him. He just doesn't know what he can do 
in a situation like that. Until the minute

04:42.315 --> 04:44.078
something happens, you don't know how it's going 
to affect you overall. When I first came back, I

04:44.098 --> 04:45.321
didn't know what I was going to do. I didn't know 
what I was going to do. There

04:46.062 --> 05:11.359
are a few that

04:46.062 --> 05:11.359
it has happened to. It looks like the worst case. So

05:13.366 --> 05:35.097
how did you deal with the fear of the band? It's hard 
to explain. Just, again, I think that's

05:35.558 --> 05:36.319
everybody. It's different. I believe that people 
ever just completely freeze and they couldn't do

05:36.659 --> 05:39.223
anything. Others just take the strength and 
others arrive and it's just like, I think that's

05:39.243 --> 05:41.326
part of the strength. When they're seeing you 
still operate, you just kind of keep doing it. So

05:43.876 --> 06:04.382
what did you do after you came back? Well, I

06:05.003 --> 06:16.347
had another

06:05.003 --> 06:16.347
10 months in the service, so I finished that and 
then I went back for general entry. And shortly

06:17.052 --> 06:39.542
thereafter, I got married to my wife. I had known 
her prior to going to Vietnam. But obviously, they

06:40.423 --> 06:41.765
wanted me to get married or anything like that. But 
we had no marriage. And I had to do that. So I got

06:42.706 --> 06:43.046
married. Let's see. It didn't take much after I got 
out of the service. As long

06:44.575 --> 06:56.757
as two years after it's back to being nominated, 
I'll get married. You know, and then get several

06:56.777 --> 06:58.500
different jobs, and then finally get to work for 
Exxon. That's my plan. So does your

06:59.088 --> 07:08.584
wife think you changed from before you went to 
Indiana? Anybody ever comment to you about that?

07:12.170 --> 07:16.838
Some of the people I think that knew me a little 
better. At that time I didn't know her. I didn't

07:17.579 --> 07:18.821
know her all that long before I went to Vietnam. 
Somebody I had met was stationed with her brother

07:18.841 --> 07:21.265
in the service and met her. before I

07:21.245 --> 07:44.196
went

07:21.245 --> 07:44.196
over, but we were just dating for a fairly short 
time. And with being in the service, I didn't see

07:44.216 --> 07:46.659
her that often, so she always felt that I changed 
significantly before, after. Some people I knew

07:46.679 --> 07:48.161
as a friend said, you know, they had seen some 
changes. I think it was just the changes that were

07:48.181 --> 07:50.104
more serious and just things in general, how it 
ended. life,

07:51.417 --> 07:58.449
but no matter changes. Anything else you'd like to 
say

07:58.469 --> 08:05.301
for the record? Like I said,

08:05.321 --> 08:15.479
I'm sure

08:05.321 --> 08:15.479
everybody has their own experiences and gains and 
losses from it, so it's, you know, everybody. I

08:15.499 --> 08:16.260
don't know if there's anything else. I

08:17.287 --> 08:32.993
have

08:17.287 --> 08:32.993
been real quiet about the whole situation, but I 
never did talk to him about it. Would you do it

08:33.013 --> 08:33.454
again? I probably wouldn't. You know, now it's 
funny, as I get older, it's hard not to. My son would

08:35.137 --> 08:35.818
ask me that question. You know,

08:35.798 --> 08:50.163
if I knew the outcome

08:35.798 --> 08:50.163
was going to be the same, I would. And if I really had 
the same convictions at the time, I would. I mean,

08:51.445 --> 08:53.488
if I felt that we were doing, you know, something 
that needed to be done for the people there.

08:53.508 --> 08:55.311
Because like I said, at the time, I had the same, I 
had the strong convictions. So I probably would if

08:55.332 --> 08:56.794
I think if I... I had the same

08:57.061 --> 09:12.927
involvement or knowledge I have now about that 
particular

08:57.061 --> 09:12.927
war. I would probably try not to get as involved 
with it as I was then because I just feel like we

09:12.947 --> 09:17.635
didn't have the full commitment to that country or 
those people that we should have if we were really

09:12.947 --> 09:17.635
trying to help. So

09:18.172 --> 09:38.157
how do

09:18.172 --> 09:38.157
you feel

09:18.172 --> 09:38.157
about the military? Would you want your son to be in 
the military? Do you have a good feeling about

09:40.720 --> 09:41.581
that? Yeah, in a way, I think it's a good 
experience. It helps you handle a lot of

09:42.562 --> 09:43.363
situations. There's a lot of good training and 
discipline and training where you get to know your

09:43.383 --> 09:45.646
own person. So I think it can be a real learning 
experience. It does have a lot of good training.

09:48.563 --> 10:09.143
And of

09:48.563 --> 10:09.143
course,

09:48.563 --> 10:09.143
you know, when there's an actual war involved in 
it, the whole experience is completely

09:48.563 --> 10:09.143
different. So, um, but it was, uh, I don't know how 
you ever can justify a war, but basically, so, um,

10:09.163 --> 10:17.271
you know, now, we'd like to see everything done, 
everything, everything, the situation resolved

10:09.163 --> 10:17.271
without a war, because it's, it seems such a futile 
thing, no matter who shot you in the eye. I

10:17.977 --> 10:32.582
mean, it does seem

10:17.977 --> 10:32.582
like a good evidence out of it, but it's hard to say 
for sure what happens there. Well, would you ever

10:32.602 --> 10:37.029
want to go back to Vietnam? Yeah, actually. To see 
what happens? Yeah, I would. I told my wife about

10:39.554 --> 10:40.034
it. The country itself is a beautiful country. You 
know, we operated in the Central Coastal Leagues

10:41.457 --> 10:44.001
and the Central Highlands. I

10:43.981 --> 10:59.509
mean,

10:43.981 --> 10:59.509
it's just, it is a land, a beautiful country, and 
sometimes when I look at the scrapbook and the

10:43.981 --> 10:59.509
pictures and stuff, you wonder about the people in 
the villages that are taking pictures of what

10:43.981 --> 10:59.509
they're doing and how they're doing it. He'd

10:59.776 --> 11:23.061
never know who they are because he don't think he 
didn't know their names. Yeah, I've always felt

11:23.081 --> 11:24.142
that I'd like to see it again. I tried to watch the 
show, but then it wasn't shown until I was in

11:24.162 --> 11:25.684
Canadian. So I had to go back and report on it. I'd 
like to do it again. That's it. Thank you. Thank

11:27.406 --> 11:27.606
you. Okay, well, on through with that.
