WEBVTT

00:01.162 --> 00:05.927
allowed him to work with me just before I entered 
the Air Force. In the succeeding four years, he was

00:07.168 --> 00:22.342
able to develop a fairly substantial department 
that was grossly inadequate to take care of the

00:07.168 --> 00:22.342
community, but at least by numbers of people, it 
was beginning to be a department with some

00:07.168 --> 00:22.342
specialization.

00:25.185 --> 00:30.510
However, shortly after I came back with the 
department, Mr. Wingo went with the Ford

00:30.828 --> 00:39.500
Foundation and left the department without a 
head. What year would that be? That was in 1956 or

00:41.102 --> 00:44.126
early 57. We had a fairly progressive city 
administration, and they recruited nationwide

00:46.109 --> 00:59.147
and brought in a new director of planning whose 
name was Merle Phillips. You mentioned a

00:59.583 --> 01:01.786
progressive city administration. Do you recall 
who the mayor was at that time? Yes, it was a Tom

01:03.449 --> 01:04.971
Rogers. He was a one-term mayor. He did quite a bit 
for the community. He was a very substantial

01:09.778 --> 01:15.667
mayor, but was not re-elected, perhaps because of 
that. What was the background of the new city

01:16.268 --> 01:19.473
planning director? The new city planning 
director was actually

01:20.915 --> 01:28.206
from Iowa. by way of California, was primarily in 
physical planning, strong in subdivision and

01:28.473 --> 01:52.858
thoroughfare design, this sort of thing, and took 
a great deal of interest in the development of or

01:28.473 --> 01:52.858
the updating of the thoroughfare plan for the 
community. Had the comprehensive plan for the

01:53.679 --> 01:56.742
city been updated during that period? It was being 
updated piecemeal, in-house, without the

01:58.679 --> 02:07.568
benefit of consultants or extra help. So 
consequently, it was dragging along, had been

02:07.688 --> 02:13.654
dragging along during Mr. Wingo's years. And when 
the new director, Merle Phillips, came in, he was

02:14.114 --> 02:28.669
able to hire a number of young planners who came in

02:14.114 --> 02:28.669
and began to develop pieces of this updated plan.

02:34.438 --> 02:35.420
It seems rather remarkable. The city had a staff, 
when he came in, of only seven planners. Yet it was

02:40.065 --> 02:43.609
going through one of its most dramatic growth 
phases. And it surely must have outstripped the

02:44.030 --> 02:48.495
plan documents and their relevance during that 
time. I suppose the kind of seat of the pants and

02:49.637 --> 02:56.445
plan as you go was the way current planning 
subdivisions and zoning cases had to be handled.

03:02.030 --> 03:02.831
This is true. So far as subdivisions go, for 
example, there was originally a few subdivisions

03:03.972 --> 03:25.538
that came through in the post-war years were 
handled sort of on an individual basis, where

03:03.972 --> 03:25.538
coordination between the city departments 
sometimes non-existent or not very satisfactory

03:26.075 --> 03:55.373
so consequently a method was developed to route a 
cloth map around to all the agencies that were

03:26.075 --> 03:55.373
thought to have some interest you developed that 
method didn't you no this this was one that was was

03:26.075 --> 03:55.373
with the community uh i guess mr stock will 
probably develop this They were essentially just

03:55.876 --> 04:02.406
routing a map around, a purported final map, and 
all of the city officials. Well, this was a map. A

04:03.928 --> 04:04.950
map only. How long did it take to gather all the 
comments together? Really, there were no

04:08.335 --> 04:10.378
comments. They were just signatures. So 
consequently, if the consulting engineer was

04:12.220 --> 04:25.360
skilled in browbeating the city officials to get 
their signatures, he could go ahead and get his map

04:12.220 --> 04:25.360
through reasonably promptly. But it literally 
might take days or weeks, and not a whole lot of

04:26.352 --> 04:33.101
coordination, really. Just a matter of, here's a 
map, look okay to you, yeah, it's fine, we'll sign

04:33.341 --> 04:39.550
here, type sort of. That must have made it 
difficult if there were comments that were in

04:39.590 --> 04:43.655
conflict with each other. This is right. And 
sometimes it was possible to play off one serious

04:47.240 --> 04:55.431
objection to a, say a circulation plan for a 
subdivision, against another comment from

04:56.002 --> 05:08.865
another city official. It wasn't very 
satisfactory, but it was at least some way to sort

05:09.606 --> 05:20.085
of coordinate new subdivisions with what existed 
then as a city plan. This was not satisfactory. It

05:23.157 --> 05:26.040
took a lot of time on the part of the consultant. It 
took a lot of time, and it wasn't possible for the

05:26.060 --> 05:45.578
city officials to really put a sufficient thought 
into the subdivision and its impact on the Long

05:26.060 --> 05:45.578
Range community. The city had a very different 
relationship with the development community at

05:46.439 --> 05:50.443
that time. have heard, at least, that up until a 
period in the 50s, the city engineering

05:50.845 --> 05:58.616
department designed the streets. This is right. 
This was a... They designed the profiles of the

06:01.720 --> 06:03.443
streets. Right. This took some of the problems 
that we experienced in a fairly recent time away.

06:14.878 --> 06:18.203
At least there was one agency that was totally 
responsible for the design of streets. And it

06:22.354 --> 06:32.124
occurs to me the only thing we have similar to that 
today is the design of the water and sewer system,

06:22.354 --> 06:32.124
which is done through local water utilities. Yes, 
this is right. Let's go back for a moment to the

06:36.709 --> 06:41.294
planning director who had just been hired. This 
had been created about 1956, you said? In about 50,

06:44.305 --> 07:02.166
1957, Mr. Phillips was hired, and he was able to 
build the department up somewhat

06:44.305 --> 07:02.166
to the size it really should have been to 
accommodate the needs of the community. So it grew

07:02.206 --> 07:03.808
from seven people to? About 20 or so. 20 people. And 
were there any other changes in the structure or

07:06.952 --> 07:10.636
administration of the department during that 
time? Yes, it was divided. once and for all into

07:14.157 --> 07:33.242
divisions at the time, advanced planning and 
current planning, and the semblance of a

07:14.157 --> 07:33.242
cartography section to provide for the special 
products that were needed in the planning

07:14.157 --> 07:33.242
process. So at that time the city planning 
department became the creator and caretaker of

07:33.482 --> 07:38.268
the zoning maps? Zoning maps and aerial photos and 
all the tools of the trade. And Mr. Phillips, how

07:45.342 --> 07:49.407
long was he the planning director? For a 
relatively short period of time. Unfortunately,

07:51.831 --> 08:08.873
he found that the rather modest salary was scaled, 
and the prevalent in the community wasn't

07:51.831 --> 08:08.873
satisfactory, and he went into consulting a 
little on his own. While he was planning director?

08:10.675 --> 08:14.961
While he was planning director, and this, of 
course, got him into a little bit of a problem.

08:17.481 --> 08:19.143
Perhaps a conflict of interest occasionally. 
Occasionally a conflict of interest, and

08:19.464 --> 08:37.705
ultimately he moved on,

08:19.464 --> 08:37.705
leaving behind the structure and the functioning 
organization and many of the, some of the people

08:19.464 --> 08:37.705
left in that period of time, receiving problems. 
But most of the structure remained behind, and the

08:37.806 --> 08:44.914
leadership was taken over by the a traffic 
engineer. What was his name? His name was Joseph

08:48.056 --> 08:49.678
Naden. He's a man who's, I recall, much of our 
signalization system and such in the city traces

08:50.459 --> 08:57.766
back to him. He was a good traffic engineer, 
wouldn't you say? A very solid traffic engineer.

09:04.993 --> 09:14.243
He had a good, strong method of expressing himself 
and was able to compromise at times to make things

09:14.645 --> 09:15.886
work. Was he able to effectively administer the 
planning department as well as his traffic

09:16.487 --> 09:20.331
engineering duties? Really, he turned the... He 
was able to keep together and to perform certain

09:23.394 --> 09:44.297
leadership functions, but he turned the actual 
planning functions over to the principals that

09:23.394 --> 09:44.297
were involved in the sections, saying something 
to the effect that, I don't know anything about

09:23.394 --> 09:44.297
planning, you take care of it, do the job, do what's 
required, we'll go on from there. This was only a

09:44.564 --> 10:12.748
short-term situation, which incidentally 
lasted probably six months to a year, at which time

09:44.564 --> 10:12.748
the city fathers recruited a gentleman

09:44.564 --> 10:12.748
by the name of John Cunningham from the King County 
area of Washington State, who came into the area

10:13.825 --> 10:19.572
with a good deal of knowledge and abilities. Who 
was the mayor at that time? I believe the mayor was

10:22.615 --> 10:43.360
Mayor Sightsinger, and he gave, the mayor and 
councilor gave a good deal of support at that time

10:22.615 --> 10:43.360
to Mr. Cunningham since we'd gone through several

10:22.615 --> 10:43.360
months or quite a few number of months of problems 
of one sort or the other.

10:46.208 --> 10:58.569
And consequently, John wanted to get as much 
accomplished as he could while this honeymoon

10:46.208 --> 10:58.569
period was in effect. And it was during this period 
that we were able to implement a number of ideas

10:58.589 --> 11:08.786
that we had had that for one reason or the other had 
not been able to bring them on board. Let's go back

11:09.828 --> 11:12.452
to the, you mentioned the means of, of routing a map 
for a subdivision plot to different agencies and

11:13.023 --> 11:19.772
how cumbersome that process was. You had some 
different ideas about that, didn't you? Yes. This

11:24.018 --> 11:29.926
is one of the things that we were able to get into 
effect not too long after Mr. Cunningham came

11:24.018 --> 11:29.926
here. I, over a long period of time, had developed 
the idea that the best way to coordinate physical

11:38.926 --> 12:02.149
planning matters, including subdivisions and 
street and alley vacations and elements of the

11:38.926 --> 12:02.149
major thoroughfares plan, et cetera, et cetera, 
was through a meeting of key people in agencies and

11:38.926 --> 12:02.149
departments that were concerned with physical 
planning in the community. I first had ideas on it

12:03.030 --> 12:08.595
when we were handling subdivision maps before the 
I went into the Air Force. When I came back, I had

12:11.214 --> 12:28.972
some definite ideas, along the ideas of a regular 
meeting of responsible city and county and state,

12:11.214 --> 12:28.972
possibly even federal officials, who were 
concerned with these matters. And it wasn't until

12:31.375 --> 12:37.401
Mr. Cunningham came on board that I was actually 
able to

12:38.832 --> 12:40.114
get the idea approved. This concept I call the 
subdivision and coordinating committee, or

12:41.336 --> 12:50.089
subdivision coordinating committee. Really, it 
involved more than coordinating subdivisions,

12:51.852 --> 13:00.925
but that was a nice, catchy name, and it seemed to 
stick, and still sticks to this day. The first

13:02.387 --> 13:07.455
meeting was called, and it was the heads of the 
public utilities in the community, electric,

13:09.038 --> 13:34.067
telephone, water, sewer, and gas, the City 
Engineering Department, representatives from

13:09.038 --> 13:34.067
some of the Department of Planning, Tax 
Department, and a few other agencies. The concept

13:36.292 --> 13:58.176
was explained, a regular meeting on the same day 
each week to review these physical planning

13:36.292 --> 13:58.176
matters, and it was seized upon with great 
enthusiasm because many of these people felt they

13:36.292 --> 13:58.176
were not able to do the job because of the press of 
time and the press of trying to review these

13:36.292 --> 13:58.176
physical planning matters. By mutual consent, 
Wednesday was selected as the day that the

14:05.063 --> 14:06.645
committee would meet. And with a few exceptions, 
mainly around the holidays, this committee has

14:08.086 --> 14:22.282
met for over 25 years, 58 to the present, another 30 
years. For a brief period, I served as the

14:22.402 --> 14:25.665
subdivision coordinator for the city. And it was a 
tremendous vehicle for making the subdivision

14:25.726 --> 14:32.573
coordinator's job simpler. generally kept 
referring to the Subdivision Coordinating

14:33.228 --> 15:02.256
Committee simply as the SCC, but it made the 
preparation of comments a painless task to have a

14:33.228 --> 15:02.256
meeting where we could discuss the subdivisions 
proposed or that had recently come in, provide a

14:33.228 --> 15:02.256
map copy to every member of the committee, 
standard routine two-week period after which

14:33.228 --> 15:02.256
comments were returned, and we could then 
assemble one unified set of comments, discuss

15:02.776 --> 15:08.022
them, and present them in a timely fashion. We were 
able to gather together the input and do our job

15:08.062 --> 15:14.971
within the 30-day time period the statute 
stipulates. Exactly. It always seemed it was kind

15:16.533 --> 15:20.437
of a joke that the SEC was held together with 
donuts. It was kind of an interesting means of

15:20.458 --> 15:27.686
keeping it together that members alternated 
bringing a snack for each other. Was this from the

15:29.048 --> 15:30.450
outset? Was this delivered? No, this really began 
when we were meeting for a period of time at the El

15:32.088 --> 15:41.643
Paso Electric Company meeting room. And they 
started the tradition of coffee and donuts. And

15:47.933 --> 15:49.535
that's where it began. And then after we moved back 
to planning facilities,

15:49.595 --> 15:59.631
to city facilities, this tradition had just 
established on a rotating basis by all the

16:00.235 --> 16:05.882
members, so it was not a big burden on anybody. The 
Department Heads Development Coordinating

16:08.005 --> 16:13.552
Committee is another group that meets on a weekly 
basis. This came about after John Cunningham took

16:13.613 --> 16:17.237
over, didn't it? It came about, I guess, about 15 or 
20 years after the SCC was established, and I

16:18.018 --> 16:29.213
believe that the basis upon which it was 
established was probably a consultant had come

16:29.328 --> 16:50.278
into town and said, gee, it would be great if the 
department heads would get together and consider

16:29.328 --> 16:50.278
matters of zoning and subdivision and physical 
planning and coordinate these things, probably

16:29.328 --> 16:50.278
without even realizing that it had such a concept 
for all those years. It does strike me that it was a

16:50.699 --> 16:52.942
bit of a duplication. Today, the department heads 
development coordinating committee reviews and

16:58.893 --> 17:06.182
virtually votes on matters of rezoning, and it's 
their decision which becomes the official staff

16:58.893 --> 17:06.182
position. What was the process for making that 
official staff recommendation on matters of

17:06.243 --> 17:15.555
rezoning prior to the department head's meeting? 
As far as zoning is concerned, this was a staff

17:15.575 --> 17:24.767
function of the Department of Planning as far as 
recommendations. The SEC never was involved in

17:24.787 --> 17:27.330
zoning matters. The staff would make its 
recommendations in accordance with the plan for

17:29.555 --> 17:48.460
the area, in accordance with the pros and cons, and 
really leave the decision to the planning

17:29.555 --> 17:48.460
commission. They didn't make hard and fast 
recommendations. They merely showed, laid out

17:51.164 --> 17:58.313
the groundwork so the commission could make an 
intelligent decision. You refer to their

17:58.934 --> 18:03.701
decisions were based, of course, on the plan 
documents which existed. And we were talking

18:04.502 --> 18:14.477
earlier about during the transition of 
leadership in the planning department, the

18:04.502 --> 18:14.477
comprehensive plan was being updated on a more or 
less piecemeal basis. Prior to John Cunningham

18:15.438 --> 18:21.587
taking over the department, was that task 
completed? Really, I can't say that it was ever

18:23.710 --> 18:28.317
completed. But there was a constant review of 
various elements of the plan. And this process

18:33.617 --> 18:37.021
continued after John Cunningham came. So rather 
than a ever so often complete update of the plan, it

18:37.661 --> 18:45.649
was simply the ongoing process that it always is. 
It was exactly an ongoing process of elements,

18:45.669 --> 18:56.160
first one element and the other, so that it was a 
fairly living kind of a document, fairly well

18:45.669 --> 18:56.160
updated. never really formally prepared and 
published. Not necessarily compiled into a

18:59.364 --> 19:06.033
single document and taken in one fell swoop for 
approval by the Council. Correct. Was the Council

19:07.895 --> 19:11.781
aware of the planned document? Was there a 
semblance of official approval of the planning

19:12.201 --> 19:18.190
thinking as to what was going on? Yes, I think there 
was. It was easy to refer to this nebulous document

19:20.773 --> 19:25.860
with all these elements that had been worked on, 
and I think there's a fair degree of comprehension

19:26.600 --> 19:40.254
that it existed and fairly well accepted by the 
council and by other governmental entities. And

19:40.274 --> 19:44.779
awareness and tacit approval without 
necessarily an official or systematic process

19:40.274 --> 19:44.779
for it. Correct. It seemed for a while that the 
planning department was a stepchild. I know it

19:50.384 --> 19:55.830
wasn't necessarily housed with the rest of the 
city offices. Do you recall some of the different

19:56.047 --> 20:01.755
facilities that the department was located

19:56.047 --> 20:01.755
in? Originally, when I went to work for the 
department, it was in the old city hall. And it was

20:08.445 --> 20:23.708
later moved

20:08.445 --> 20:23.708
to, because of space requirements and the fact 
that the city government was going, to a separate

20:08.445 --> 20:23.708
lease facility

20:26.641 --> 20:28.323
on Kansas Street. This was a fairly modest 
facility, but it was probably three times the

20:28.604 --> 20:35.053
space that it had in the old city hall. It stayed 
there for a number of years through the early and

20:37.397 --> 20:54.842
middle 50s, then moved when, after Mr. Wingo had 
left, and actually after Mr. Phillips had left, it

20:37.397 --> 20:54.842
moved to another facility at I think it was 212 
South Campbell, a rather large old equipment

20:56.088 --> 21:24.390
sales building, very large reinforced concrete, 
lots of space, which was piecemeal remodeled over

20:56.088 --> 21:24.390
a long period of time to provide for meeting rooms 
and various office facilities, even a coffee shop

20:56.088 --> 21:24.390
where the subdivision coordinating committee 
was. conceived and created. From there the

21:28.608 --> 21:48.386
department was moved to another location and I 
don't recall the address but it's another

21:28.608 --> 21:48.386
separate building and it wasn't until the new city 
hall was constructed that the department

21:28.608 --> 21:48.386
actually became a part of the rest of the city. The 
fact that the department wasn't necessarily

21:48.406 --> 21:53.331
located in the same building as the elected 
leaders and city council chambers and some of the

21:54.745 --> 21:58.131
other city departments. Do you think that implied 
anything in terms of relationship with planning,

21:58.631 --> 22:04.441
or was that simply a circumstantial space? I think 
it really depended upon who viewed it. Some people

22:10.110 --> 22:18.424
probably said, get those ivory tower people out of 
the way and don't have to worry about them. I think

22:18.843 --> 22:21.206
the department did a pretty good idea. It got it 
away from politics somewhat and was able to

22:21.266 --> 22:32.159
function in its own way independently and then 
make its presentation to the governmental

22:21.266 --> 22:32.159
entities at the right time. It was a degree of 
independence that was created that way, I think.

22:36.804 --> 22:42.951
I'm going to ask you a question now that is asked of 
every person that has been interviewed for this.

22:44.173 --> 22:46.015
If you could think about it for a moment and tell us 
what you would consider to be the five or so major

22:46.366 --> 22:54.135
events that have affected the planning and 
development of El Paso.

22:59.502 --> 23:16.322
Well, you'd have to go ahead and say that the 
phenomenal growth after the war, just completely

22:59.502 --> 23:16.322
outpacing the ability of government to provide 
services, for a period of time.

23:22.761 --> 23:29.650
Perhaps this gave more awareness on the part of the 
elected officials of the importance and need for

23:22.761 --> 23:29.650
planning. This is right. Because of this 
inadequacy,

23:32.053 --> 23:40.504
I think there's a great deal more recognition that 
They needed the help of professionals in

23:40.990 --> 23:50.102
providing for the extension of the services 
required to serve this growing community. The

23:50.122 --> 24:07.065
much heralded Shama's Isle settlement certainly 
was a major effect on the community and caused a

23:50.122 --> 24:07.065
great deal of disruption.

24:08.142 --> 24:12.668
opened up avenues for improvement in the south 
side area. Another huge impact, particularly the

24:13.810 --> 24:30.072
east-west freeway, Interstate 10, totally 
disrupted the older area of town and created

24:13.810 --> 24:30.072
changes that are continuing to this day. 
Redirected our growth forever. Exactly. And to a

24:33.316 --> 24:36.360
lesser degree, the north-south were able to 
accommodate. Now I don't think it's nearly the

24:38.507 --> 24:40.749
same. Perhaps its impact is yet to be felt. 
Exactly. Another very large effect, back in about

24:44.552 --> 25:04.710
1954, the Public Service Board, which provides 
the water for the community, perceived the need to

24:44.552 --> 25:04.710
stabilize

24:44.552 --> 25:04.710
and to secure as much water resource as possible in 
order to accomplish this,

25:05.180 --> 25:21.296
purchased from individuals, sometimes with a 
threat of condemnation, but more often a friendly

25:05.180 --> 25:21.296
purchase. And from the state, huge areas of land, 
particularly the north, west, and northeast,

25:21.316 --> 25:34.309
everything essentially north of the city limits 
from the Fort Bliss Military Reservation east to

25:35.352 --> 25:39.098
the Mexico State line north of the city. This did 
one very large thing. It placed under public

25:45.608 --> 26:03.115
protection land which could be exploited on a more 
controlled basis and developed to provide for

25:45.608 --> 26:03.115
public facilities and an orderly disposal of the 
land. to provide for more orderly growth pattern

26:04.073 --> 26:06.656
in that area. Consequently, you've had a little 
bit more stable development in those areas than

26:07.136 --> 26:16.987
you have to the east and southeast.

26:20.331 --> 26:30.081
In fact, a good amount of the land that's still held 
by El Paso Water Utilities is yet to be developed,

26:20.331 --> 26:30.081
and plans are being undertaken Who knows? It may be 
that the northernmost portion of northeast El

26:31.713 --> 26:41.146
Paso will develop along the lines of Cielo Vista, 
with the public body being the governing force of

26:31.713 --> 26:41.146
the development pattern. The difference, 
really, between the airport development in Cielo

26:41.166 --> 27:00.152
Vista and the public service board concept of 
development in northeast, the public service

26:41.166 --> 27:00.152
board wanted to stay out of the master planning 
area and let private enterprise working in

27:00.503 --> 27:12.139
conjunction with the governmental forces, 
developed the area to its highest and best use in

27:00.503 --> 27:12.139
accordance with the master plan for the city. 
There was a great deal less governmental input,

27:14.222 --> 27:28.722
except from the Department of Planning, in the 
northeast area and the northwest area, land that

27:14.222 --> 27:28.722
was owned by the Public Service Board originally. 
than there was in the airport area. Of course,

27:32.402 --> 27:34.405
beyond this airport area, it was at the bottom.

27:37.249 --> 27:41.816
The Sierra Vista area, by the way, was about 3,000 
acres, I believe. Sizable land park. Right. And

27:43.558 --> 27:51.790
the public service board owned and owns about 35 or 
so sections of land. Okay. Incidentally, this

27:56.124 --> 28:20.410
land has been sold by the Public Service Board on a 
sealed bid basis in increments

27:56.124 --> 28:20.410
in a way that public facilities like school sites, 
arterials, park sites have been reserved and

27:56.124 --> 28:20.410
provided to the various agencies at normal cost, 
saving the public money, or at no cost at all in some

28:20.828 --> 28:33.723
cases. Today, El Paso is a very different city than 
some of the period we've described. We're a city of

28:38.629 --> 28:40.492
over 400,000. The city of Juarez, the population 
estimates vary from a million and a half to who

28:40.672 --> 28:49.182
knows what. We've seen a tremendous amount of 
growth. We have some problems with our economy.

28:55.858 --> 29:00.686
Tell me, what do you see as the future direction of 
El Paso city planning efforts, say, in the next 10

28:55.858 --> 29:00.686
years?

29:04.512 --> 29:17.211
The biggest problem that El Paso has and the 
biggest impact on planning and on our area really

29:04.512 --> 29:17.211
is totally beyond the local community, in my 
opinion. We're faced with an immigration

29:18.372 --> 29:31.072
situation, a border situation here,

29:18.372 --> 29:31.072
over which the city itself has no control. We're 
talking about some of the wave of immigration

29:32.094 --> 29:36.101
we've seen over the last few years. We're talking 
about literally millions of Mexicans, Central

29:36.421 --> 29:45.696
Americans, and South Americans who are moving 
north trying to get to this country, and a lot of

29:36.421 --> 29:45.696
them are impacting the El Paso area. We've seen it 
through the tremendous growth in Juarez. We've

29:53.034 --> 30:09.901
seen it through the tremendous border crossing 
problems that we've had, the impact on the border

29:53.034 --> 30:09.901
patrol trying to control immigration, illegal 
immigration to the extent that they have,

29:53.034 --> 30:09.901
unsuccessfully to a large degree. We've seen it in 
the invasion of the public facilities that we have

30:12.693 --> 30:31.377
in the community where we're actually and in fact 
are providing parks for the city of El Paso and the

30:12.693 --> 30:31.377
city of Juarez with all the supporting taxes 
coming from the city. city of el paso that's true we

30:31.998 --> 30:56.976
also see it in our county hospital facilities 
we're seeing it in the county hospital facilities

30:31.998 --> 30:56.976
we're seeing it all that the health services that 
are available where illegal people people from

30:31.998 --> 30:56.976
another country come in take advantage of the 
facilities pay nothing in the way of taxes or

30:31.998 --> 30:56.976
direct contribution and then disappear yet el 
paso is a poor community and el paso is a poor

30:31.998 --> 30:56.976
community and it's becoming poorer on account of 
these external influences and the rating the

30:57.884 --> 31:18.458
county judge for example presented the bill just 
this year i believe it was to the federal

30:57.884 --> 31:18.458
government for eight million dollars for 
services that had been rendered by the county

30:57.884 --> 31:18.458
hospital to
