00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:09.888
I was at the MSC and at that time they had some counters in the cafe area and they were kind of horseshoe shaped.

00:00:09.908 --> 00:00:17.888
And I happened to be sitting on one end of one of those horseshoes and there were some students nearby that I could overhear their conversation.

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:23.417
And I guess this was probably about my first semester here, or first year here.

00:00:23.457 --> 00:00:29.605
And I overheard him say, that fellow Barker in psychology, he is chicken shit.

00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:34.852
He says he never gives you the same test from one semester to another.

00:00:35.653 --> 00:00:38.818
And he even gives different tests for different sections of the same course.

00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:41.882
And I did face a problem there.

00:00:41.902 --> 00:00:48.010
I didn't know whether the ethical thing for me to do was be to identify myself or not.

00:00:48.614 --> 00:00:50.176
would be embarrassing to them either way.

00:00:50.356 --> 00:00:54.162
So I just left soon after that without saying anything.

00:00:56.425 --> 00:01:10.665
Did any in those early semesters, did anybody ever give you one of the memorable Aggie explanations for his grandfather dying on the test day or something like that?

00:01:11.185 --> 00:01:15.972
I do remember somewhat later than my first years here, but I remember

00:01:16.205 --> 00:01:21.934
I was walking across the campus and one of my students hailed me from a great distance about a block away.

00:01:21.954 --> 00:01:24.758
He just yelled, everybody could hear it, Dr. Barker.

00:01:25.339 --> 00:01:36.576
So I waited for him and he came running up and he said, I just wanted to tell you that San Antonio, I have to be in San Antonio Monday to be in court and so I won't be in class.

00:01:36.893 --> 00:01:42.431
I said, well, I thank you for telling me that, but I noticed that you missed quite a few times and never said a thing about it.

00:01:42.992 --> 00:01:44.417
Why are you telling me now?

00:01:44.437 --> 00:01:46.363
And he said, well, this time I had an excuse.

00:01:49.702 --> 00:01:51.304
Oh, that's good, that's good.

00:01:51.564 --> 00:01:53.427
But I'm not complaining about attendance.

00:01:53.507 --> 00:01:55.449
I think my attendance was exemplary.

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:02.037
But there were a few times I had people like that fellow from San Antonio, but that was pretty rare.

00:02:02.077 --> 00:02:07.484
It was more common later when the university became larger.

00:02:09.286 --> 00:02:14.713
In those early weeks, while you were here during the week by yourself,

00:02:15.217 --> 00:02:16.499
Where did you eat?

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:18.161
Did you go to the movies?

00:02:18.221 --> 00:02:20.284
What did you do for any kind of diversion?

00:02:20.845 --> 00:02:22.167
Okay.

00:02:22.187 --> 00:02:32.642
Of course that wasn't very long, just a few months, but I would work late at the office and I would come to the library where we are right now in this building.

00:02:32.662 --> 00:02:34.625
Well, attached to this building.

00:02:35.546 --> 00:02:40.373
And I would have meals at the MSC most of the time.

00:02:41.134 --> 00:02:43.958
Sometimes I would go to a restaurant at the Northgate area.

00:02:45.153 --> 00:02:48.339
There weren't any McDonald's or fast food chains here.

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:53.288
And the other cafes in town, I guess I ate at them at one time or another, all of them.

00:02:53.348 --> 00:02:55.892
But most of my meals I took at the MSC.

00:02:55.912 --> 00:02:57.896
So I was on the campus almost all the time.

00:02:58.858 --> 00:03:02.284
And of course, it was a good thing, really, that I was

00:03:02.332 --> 00:03:19.311
uh single and celibate in those days because uh i was really having to learn everything at once you know i'd had no even no time prior to the beginning of classes to to make lesson plans because i presume you were working almost every uh

00:03:19.882 --> 00:03:23.568
non-class hour getting lectures ready.

00:03:23.608 --> 00:03:24.690
That's right, I was.

00:03:26.052 --> 00:03:27.815
But it was a very exciting time for me.

00:03:27.895 --> 00:03:42.619
I never felt really strained by it, but I guess it was good that I didn't have many family responsibilities for that short time because I probably wouldn't have been able to catch on to it as quickly as I did.

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:46.024
Of those first courses, which one did you enjoy most?

00:03:49.835 --> 00:04:03.019
I believe I enjoyed my, well, you were asking what I taught, and I said those undergraduate courses in test and measurement and those other, they all were classes of fair size, about 30 to 50.

00:04:04.682 --> 00:04:10.392
But then I had one graduate course in test and measurements.

00:04:10.642 --> 00:04:12.486
I believe there were only about eight in there.

00:04:13.467 --> 00:04:16.493
And one of them was on the faculty.

00:04:16.573 --> 00:04:17.756
It was Earl Kniebel.

00:04:18.257 --> 00:04:19.018
You probably knew him.

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.866
He was already had a doctor's degree, even.

00:04:23.006 --> 00:04:25.391
I don't guess he needed it for academic credit or anything.

00:04:25.972 --> 00:04:27.394
But he just wanted to take that course.

00:04:27.414 --> 00:04:33.426
And he performed exactly like any other student and did all the work, took all the tests.

00:04:33.507 --> 00:04:37.905
And then I had some school teachers or administrators around here that came in.

00:04:37.925 --> 00:04:42.302
It was a night class, evening class.

00:04:42.805 --> 00:04:45.188
And I believe I kind of liked that one the best.

00:04:45.268 --> 00:04:47.492
But I liked them all, Haskell, I really did.

00:04:47.512 --> 00:04:52.759
I know that sounds kind of Pollyanna, but I absolutely did enjoy every class.

00:04:52.839 --> 00:04:53.720
Each one was different.

00:04:56.003 --> 00:05:01.191
The general psychology classes I liked because it was something different every day.

00:05:01.351 --> 00:05:06.899
I mean, you cover the whole field of psychology in four months, so it can't get boring.

00:05:07.559 --> 00:05:12.306
Now, the university at that time, or the college, it was the Agricultural Mechanical College of Texas,

00:05:12.674 --> 00:05:22.768
had, didn't have authority to give a degree, even an undergraduate in psychology, but it did give an undergraduate degree in education and a master's?

00:05:23.308 --> 00:05:23.549
Yes.

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.635
The master's was, and it included certification to be a school principal.

00:05:29.336 --> 00:05:32.761
And there was also a master's that you could get a certificate to be a school counselor.

00:05:32.821 --> 00:05:34.764
And I was involved in that program quite a bit.

00:05:34.784 --> 00:05:38.749
And then

00:05:40.906 --> 00:05:41.747
Yes, that's right.

00:05:41.867 --> 00:05:42.828
Those were our masters.

00:05:42.868 --> 00:05:46.112
And we didn't have any elementary education.

00:05:46.132 --> 00:05:48.315
Now, they were all male.

00:05:48.936 --> 00:05:51.739
Can you generalize any more about the students?

00:05:52.099 --> 00:05:55.143
Did they tend to be urban, rural, Anglo?

00:05:57.526 --> 00:05:59.528
Or was it kind of a cross-section of Texas?

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:10.221
Well, I think they were above average socioeconomic

00:06:10.437 --> 00:06:23.217
I don't believe I had very many poor ones, but I don't know that I could tell, you know, the way they were at A&M and all in uniform and the way they were with each other, the way the attitude they had toward each other.

00:06:23.237 --> 00:06:32.952
I don't know that I would know that, but I felt that they were, for the most part, from moderately well-to-do to very well-to-do.

00:06:33.353 --> 00:06:34.455
families on the whole.

00:06:34.855 --> 00:06:36.117
I later found out that was true.

00:06:36.557 --> 00:06:40.303
You know, I later had some information about that that indicate that was true.

00:06:41.464 --> 00:06:53.421
And maybe this would be a good time to mention to you that the first undergraduate black students that enrolled in A&M

00:06:54.869 --> 00:06:57.152
were in my class, first two.

00:06:57.312 --> 00:07:00.317
Let's hold that because we sure want to get to that.

00:07:00.597 --> 00:07:01.418
That's in the summer.

00:07:01.578 --> 00:07:02.640
In the summer, right.

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:04.983
They were at 7 a.m. on Monday morning.

00:07:05.083 --> 00:07:06.045
Yes, yes, yes.

00:07:06.085 --> 00:07:07.026
We want to get to that.

00:07:08.969 --> 00:07:11.692
But I liked them.

00:07:12.173 --> 00:07:13.054
I really did like them.

00:07:13.275 --> 00:07:14.817
Yeah, we'll get to that.

00:07:15.458 --> 00:07:17.420
I'm talking about the general students.

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:18.161
Oh, the general students.

00:07:18.181 --> 00:07:18.422
Right.

00:07:19.644 --> 00:07:22.868
Your grading policy, did you grade on the curve or anything?

00:07:23.877 --> 00:07:27.843
Yes, I graded on the curve, like Warble taught me.

00:07:27.863 --> 00:07:32.109
I adapted it to him, but I did.

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:40.602
And in those early years, did any student come and give you any sob story to try to talk you into a higher grade?

00:07:40.662 --> 00:07:43.607
Oh, that happened, yeah, from time to time.

00:07:43.727 --> 00:07:48.674
Any memorable excuses that they tried to offer?

00:07:48.694 --> 00:07:51.859
I can't really think of any that were really memorable.

00:07:53.003 --> 00:07:58.230
But it wasn't extremely common, but it did happen.

00:07:58.890 --> 00:07:59.111
All right.

00:07:59.151 --> 00:08:06.900
Now, those first weeks, you would leave then late on Friday and go to Austin to see family.

00:08:07.081 --> 00:08:07.381
Right.

00:08:07.401 --> 00:08:08.943
And then come back Sunday.

00:08:08.963 --> 00:08:10.305
Sunday night, usually.

00:08:11.486 --> 00:08:14.109
Sunday night.

00:08:14.129 --> 00:08:17.914
And then about when did you learn that you had a continuing appointment?

00:08:18.248 --> 00:08:20.871
I think that was late in the first semester.

00:08:21.311 --> 00:08:24.955
I don't really have a clear recall of that, but it seems like about that.

00:08:25.035 --> 00:08:26.477
You know, before Christmas, I think.

00:08:26.497 --> 00:08:26.837
Before Christmas.

00:08:26.877 --> 00:08:27.498
About Christmas.

00:08:28.319 --> 00:08:40.872
And so, and then your wife tries to sell the house and they come over and... Let's see, that would be in the spring, you know, late winter of 1960.

00:08:41.033 --> 00:08:41.293
Right.

00:08:42.754 --> 00:08:44.256
Back here on the campus,

00:08:44.607 --> 00:08:45.889
Hubert was the dean.

00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:49.495
What did you see of the other senior administrators?

00:08:50.316 --> 00:08:54.182
Earl Rudder, the president, Wayne Hall, the vice president, did you?

00:08:54.222 --> 00:09:01.013
Well, I met all of them and, you know, had a speaking acquaintance with them.

00:09:00.993 --> 00:09:03.437
But I really didn't have much business with any of them.

00:09:03.918 --> 00:09:05.280
I just taught my classes.

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:09.206
What was your impression of Earl Rudder early?

00:09:11.049 --> 00:09:15.496
I had a lot of respect for him and thought he was an able man.

00:09:15.776 --> 00:09:18.681
And I thought he was reasonable.

00:09:19.302 --> 00:09:23.887
I'd heard some criticism of him, and I didn't agree with that criticism.

00:09:24.268 --> 00:09:36.042
Some people probably didn't know him, read that he was really kind of inflexible or kind of harsh and like that.

00:09:36.062 --> 00:09:37.263
But I didn't find that at all.

00:09:37.283 --> 00:09:40.467
Of course, I didn't have a lot of dealings with him.

00:09:41.054 --> 00:09:45.160
By the way, I still have some family in Waco.

00:09:46.362 --> 00:09:58.780
And years and years after, just not so many years ago, my brother-in-law, my wife's brother in Waco, and his wife said that they met somebody at a party in Waco.

00:09:59.962 --> 00:10:05.751
And we mentioned that Don Barker, our relative, was on the faculty there.

00:10:06.271 --> 00:10:08.074
And he said, well, I hired Don Barker.

00:10:09.438 --> 00:10:10.799
And I said, well, who was it?

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:15.985
He said, well, it was a big, kind of quite a few people there, and we don't remember what his name was.

00:10:17.106 --> 00:10:20.130
And I says, well, was it Grady Parker?

00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:21.631
They said, no, that wasn't it.

00:10:22.953 --> 00:10:26.957
Was it Walter Vorpahl?

00:10:27.398 --> 00:10:27.818
They said, no.

00:10:29.019 --> 00:10:31.722
And I said, well, could it have been Frank Hubert?

00:10:31.742 --> 00:10:32.363
They said, no.

00:10:34.125 --> 00:10:37.128
And I said, well, surely it wasn't Earl Rudder?

00:10:38.029 --> 00:10:38.770
They said, no.

00:10:40.252 --> 00:10:42.234
Because I wouldn't have thought Earl Rudder hired me.

00:10:42.975 --> 00:10:45.358
I don't know that I had an interview with him on it.

00:10:45.378 --> 00:10:48.301
And I said, well, I don't know who it could have been.

00:10:48.321 --> 00:10:55.069
I said, just not even thinking it was a good guess.

00:10:55.089 --> 00:10:56.831
It certainly wasn't Tom Harrington, was it?

00:10:56.891 --> 00:10:58.012
He said, yeah, that's who it was.

00:11:03.298 --> 00:11:09.685
How long was it before you encountered some of the basic Aggie traditions?

00:11:10.357 --> 00:11:13.542
I guess the first day, probably.

00:11:13.562 --> 00:11:14.804
I always heard about those.

00:11:15.185 --> 00:11:18.751
Howdy was the most obvious one, and that's one that I missed.

00:11:18.851 --> 00:11:20.995
I think it was such a good tradition.

00:11:21.856 --> 00:11:24.420
But yeah, I heard them all along.

00:11:26.063 --> 00:11:32.213
How long before you went to a football game or a silver taps or a Yale practice?

00:11:33.712 --> 00:11:39.100
I didn't make the football games regular for a while since I was going back home on weekends.

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:41.043
And even after that, I didn't for a while.

00:11:41.804 --> 00:11:45.711
Later, I became a very regular at all the sporting events.

00:11:46.472 --> 00:11:52.100
But I think I went to silver taps the first time they had one.

00:11:52.661 --> 00:11:56.587
Of course, they didn't have them as many as often then with a smaller enrollment.

00:11:57.268 --> 00:12:01.575
I don't know if we had one the first semester or not, but certainly the first year I went to one.

00:12:02.264 --> 00:12:05.232
Did that strike you as an appropriately positive?

00:12:05.914 --> 00:12:06.997
Oh, I was so impressed.

00:12:07.017 --> 00:12:09.003
Yeah, very impressed.

00:12:09.023 --> 00:12:11.369
And I went to quite a few of them.

00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:13.295
Did you go to Bonfire early?

00:12:14.318 --> 00:12:15.902
Yes, I did.

00:12:16.557 --> 00:12:19.441
And I never cared a whole great deal for those.

00:12:19.541 --> 00:12:24.186
But especially it was when they used to have it over on the south side of the campus.

00:12:24.247 --> 00:12:27.891
It was so near my house that it caused great traffic problems.

00:12:27.991 --> 00:12:30.314
And I was afraid even safety problems.

00:12:30.334 --> 00:12:32.296
So I never was very fond of Bonfire.

00:12:32.617 --> 00:12:35.520
But I did attend a lot of them and took my children to them many times.

00:12:35.601 --> 00:12:40.827
And we did have some good times on Bonfire Night, had company over after that.

00:12:40.807 --> 00:13:06.426
bonfire since we were near there and so i had mixed feelings about it i was glad enough to see it move though to the polo grounds all right you uh then in the spring but i was into the traditions you know i was interested in them and and i asked about them you know and and it was was very i made sure that i got acquainted with that how long did it take you to feel like that you might be here a good while

00:13:08.617 --> 00:13:10.719
Did you think in those terms early?

00:13:11.219 --> 00:13:11.860
Yes, I did.

00:13:13.261 --> 00:13:21.788
So you never were guilty of what I call the missionary complex, those people that act like they're doing A&M a favor just by being here?

00:13:22.009 --> 00:13:22.329
Never.

00:13:22.529 --> 00:13:24.931
And that they're looking at their watch to see?

00:13:24.951 --> 00:13:26.192
No.

00:13:26.212 --> 00:13:26.893
OK.

00:13:26.913 --> 00:13:31.016
I knew when I first came that I was only employed as a one-year appointment.

00:13:31.577 --> 00:13:36.481
And then during that year, I was told, no, you're a regular like anybody else.

00:13:36.501 --> 00:13:38.623
We don't have tenure.

00:13:38.992 --> 00:13:40.617
In fact, I never even heard of tenure.

00:13:40.637 --> 00:13:41.459
I knew much about it.

00:13:42.081 --> 00:13:43.605
But I never thought much about it.

00:13:43.625 --> 00:13:51.567
I felt very secure in my employment because, well, I just didn't see any reason not to.

00:13:52.357 --> 00:14:06.255
doing my work well, I thought, and was being told I was doing it well, and the students seemed to like me, and the other faculty members, I got along with them, and I didn't, I had very little contact with the administration, and I thought that was good.

00:14:06.295 --> 00:14:08.177
I thought that was a good sign.

00:14:11.502 --> 00:14:16.508
And I really thought it would be permanent, and by the way, one time,

00:14:17.416 --> 00:14:26.543
I was in to see Dean Hubert when he was dean of whatever college we were in at that time, and on some other matter.

00:14:26.683 --> 00:14:31.257
And he said, oh, by the way, we're going to start having something called tenure here, and you've got it.

00:14:33.278 --> 00:14:36.181
That makes some people mad to hear that I received tenure that way.

00:14:36.701 --> 00:14:43.927
Well, if I'm not mistaken, all of us under an act of the legislature who had more than seven years or more.

00:14:44.368 --> 00:14:45.489
We grandfathered in, huh?

00:14:45.529 --> 00:14:47.510
We were grandfathered in.

00:14:47.991 --> 00:14:55.637
At the end of your first year or somewhere near the end of your first year, did you get the impression you had been evaluated?

00:14:55.758 --> 00:15:02.003
Did anybody call you in or write you a letter to tell you you had done this or not done that?

00:15:03.113 --> 00:15:20.357
No, it was done verbally, and I remember one time during my first year in a faculty meeting, Grady Parker said to the faculty, don't you all think Don Barker has fit in real good here and doing a good job?

00:15:21.458 --> 00:15:26.185
And they all applauded real loud and patted me on the back.

00:15:26.232 --> 00:15:28.816
And it was one of the best feelings that I've ever had.

00:15:30.059 --> 00:15:30.740
That is good.

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:32.302
And I thought that was good as tenure.

00:15:32.703 --> 00:15:34.366
Yes, yes.

00:15:34.386 --> 00:15:34.887
I agree.

00:15:35.788 --> 00:15:42.340
All right, then you all moved into a house in the spring semester or early summer?

00:15:43.602 --> 00:15:46.827
Yeah, a rented house that time on Carter Creek.

00:15:46.847 --> 00:15:48.109
And we were only there about a year.

00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:49.933
OK.

00:15:50.474 --> 00:15:51.936
Were you churchgoers?

00:15:52.118 --> 00:15:58.724
We took our children to church at the Cavett Avenue Baptist Church.

00:16:00.366 --> 00:16:01.687
And I joined that church, too.

00:16:01.967 --> 00:16:02.728
All right.

00:16:02.788 --> 00:16:10.115
And how did you and wife and family, how did y'all make close friends here?

00:16:10.415 --> 00:16:12.337
Well, it was mostly through our children.

00:16:12.938 --> 00:16:13.718
That's the way it was.

00:16:13.979 --> 00:16:18.683
When we moved here, Becky, well, see, Laura was about,

00:16:21.025 --> 00:16:21.686
Let me see.

00:16:21.706 --> 00:16:30.417
The younger one, Becky, was only about three or four years old, and Laura was about five or six, something like that.

00:16:31.819 --> 00:16:36.785
And so they, that's how we met everybody, you know.

00:16:37.746 --> 00:16:41.651
They would play with the neighbor children, and we'd hear about them, and then we'd meet their parents.

00:16:41.671 --> 00:16:48.420
Almost everybody, I was known mostly as Laura's daddy or Becky's daddy.

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:50.863
That was how I knew most people.

00:16:51.113 --> 00:16:53.116
other than on the campus.

00:16:53.256 --> 00:16:58.023
And you all bought a house that was about what age?

00:16:58.043 --> 00:16:58.544
It was new.

00:16:59.065 --> 00:17:00.888
We didn't build it, but it had been built.

00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:07.798
And then they started the NM Consolidated, your children did.

00:17:08.238 --> 00:17:13.366
What was your impression in those early years of the NM Consolidated schools?

00:17:13.847 --> 00:17:15.349
Well, we were very pleased with them.

00:17:15.329 --> 00:17:17.092
So were we.

00:17:18.354 --> 00:17:18.935
Very pleased.

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:30.896
About when were there some reorganizational changes that began to make important impression on education?

00:17:32.999 --> 00:17:39.430
Well, in the one that I was involved in a whole lot that really affected my career a

00:17:40.152 --> 00:17:45.739
was about 19, I think about 1963 or 64.

00:17:47.021 --> 00:17:51.126
And even just in those three or four years, the programs had grown a lot.

00:17:51.166 --> 00:17:58.877
And we were approved to have a PhD in education.

00:17:59.998 --> 00:18:04.204
And that would be to include educational administration and curriculum instruction.

00:18:04.784 --> 00:18:09.130
And that curriculum instruction was quite a catch-all.

00:18:09.397 --> 00:18:15.143
science education, the English education, and a lot of different things could come under that umbrella.

00:18:15.904 --> 00:18:21.350
And I was designated to be the director of the doctoral programs in education.

00:18:22.571 --> 00:18:29.639
And that was a new program for us, and so I had to plan it and organize it, along with other people, of course.

00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:34.024
Hubert was involved in that a lot, and of course, Paul Hensling very, very much.

00:18:34.384 --> 00:18:37.648
As far as you know, who were the prime movers

00:18:37.932 --> 00:18:41.356
in that proposal and getting it approved in Austin?

00:18:43.498 --> 00:18:46.742
Well, Paul Hensley had a whole lot to do with it, and so did Frank Hubert.

00:18:47.723 --> 00:18:50.887
And I do believe Earl Rutter was very strongly in favor of it.

00:18:52.909 --> 00:18:56.013
We already had a doctoral program in industrial education.

00:18:56.033 --> 00:18:58.135
Another department, Chris Gronemann, was in that.

00:18:58.155 --> 00:19:00.058
And he was very supportive in that.

00:19:01.259 --> 00:19:05.644
And by the way, our doctoral program even included ag ed at that time.

00:19:06.198 --> 00:19:08.822
And physical ed included, too.

00:19:08.862 --> 00:19:10.886
I didn't mention that.

00:19:10.906 --> 00:19:11.987
Health education, too.

00:19:12.769 --> 00:19:14.111
So I believe those that I'm in.

00:19:14.171 --> 00:19:19.499
Paul Hensling and Frank Hubert and Earl Rutter.

00:19:20.361 --> 00:19:20.882
And let's see.

00:19:20.922 --> 00:19:24.507
We had several graduate college deans along about then.

00:19:24.568 --> 00:19:25.749
Wayne Hall was one of them.

00:19:25.769 --> 00:19:29.556
And there's another one.

00:19:29.776 --> 00:19:30.577
George Kunze.

00:19:30.798 --> 00:19:31.358
Oh, well, no.

00:19:31.399 --> 00:19:32.340
That was before him.

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:32.600
Right.

00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:34.723
Well, no, he follows Hall.

00:19:34.743 --> 00:19:36.805
Well, who preceded Hall?

00:19:37.906 --> 00:19:39.228
Well, he's before you and me.

00:19:39.588 --> 00:19:40.069
Oh, uh-huh.

00:19:40.269 --> 00:19:43.953
Because Bill Barzac was the associate dean of the graduate school.

00:19:44.113 --> 00:19:45.054
I was the assistant.

00:19:45.455 --> 00:19:48.238
And Hall was vice president and graduate dean.

00:19:48.999 --> 00:19:56.067
And then they brought in Coonsey to be the first graduate dean only.

00:19:56.198 --> 00:19:59.223
Well, Wayne Hall was supportive in the effort.

00:19:59.423 --> 00:20:09.238
And of course, all the department heads were very much involved in it, not just Paul Hensling, but like Earl Kniebel, I believe.

00:20:09.398 --> 00:20:09.999
Well, let's see.

00:20:10.079 --> 00:20:11.361
I think he was the head then.

00:20:12.243 --> 00:20:18.853
And Tischler, I believe it was, over in physical education before Carl Landis.

00:20:19.454 --> 00:20:21.497
Or maybe Carl Landis was head by that time.

00:20:22.169 --> 00:20:31.760
And then, let's see, the curriculum and instruction, I don't remember who was ahead then, but they would definitely be involved.

00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:32.661
They were the bulk of it.

00:20:32.961 --> 00:20:37.447
Do you remember some of the first students in that doctoral program?

00:20:37.467 --> 00:20:37.647
Oh, yeah.

00:20:37.887 --> 00:20:38.748
Who were some of those?

00:20:41.011 --> 00:20:49.881
Well, one of them was, well, the very first one to graduate was Campbell Mograbi.

00:20:50.063 --> 00:20:51.084
And he was from Jordan.

00:20:51.685 --> 00:20:53.448
I don't know how he landed here exactly.

00:20:54.089 --> 00:20:55.310
Can you spell Mugrabi?

00:20:55.931 --> 00:20:56.592
I think so.

00:20:56.833 --> 00:20:59.436
M-O-G-R-H-A-B-I.

00:21:00.978 --> 00:21:14.738
And then the superintendent, later became superintendent of schools, I think he already was in the school administration, Wesley

00:21:16.085 --> 00:21:17.747
Summers, Wesley Summers.

00:21:17.787 --> 00:21:20.089
He was one of our first graduates.

00:21:20.109 --> 00:21:21.030
Who recruited those?

00:21:21.050 --> 00:21:22.652
John Hoyle was among the first two.

00:21:22.672 --> 00:21:22.993
Okay.

00:21:23.153 --> 00:21:24.374
Who recruited those students?

00:21:25.115 --> 00:21:27.197
Was there anybody that went out and made an effort to?

00:21:28.699 --> 00:21:29.580
Well, we all did.

00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:40.612
We put out some publishing materials and sent it to all the other colleges and to a lot of the high schools and a lot of professional organizations.

00:21:40.692 --> 00:21:45.417
We had things appear in the newspapers and

00:21:46.949 --> 00:21:49.311
professional publications in the various fields.

00:21:49.451 --> 00:21:59.560
And we had meetings on the campus of some educators' conferences.

00:22:02.002 --> 00:22:05.445
But I would say that Paul Hensling had a whole lot.

00:22:05.465 --> 00:22:11.811
That was his strong point, by the way, was public relations or publicity and that kind of thing.

00:22:11.831 --> 00:22:14.073
Describe his background before you got to A&M.

00:22:14.493 --> 00:22:15.234
Where had he been?

00:22:15.314 --> 00:22:16.315
What had he done?

00:22:17.392 --> 00:22:21.858
He came here as he had been assistant superintendent in Port Arthur.

00:22:21.918 --> 00:22:23.400
I believe that was right before he came here.

00:22:23.601 --> 00:22:24.742
No, it was Aldine.

00:22:24.762 --> 00:22:26.345
He was superintendent, I think, in Aldine.

00:22:26.365 --> 00:22:31.031
And before that, he was assistant superintendent down in your neck of the woods, Port Arthur.

00:22:32.193 --> 00:22:40.905
And he had had special training in the field of educational administration that has to do with public relations and publicity.

00:22:40.945 --> 00:22:43.789
And so he was always very much involved in that.

00:22:44.670 --> 00:22:47.314
So he had ways of pushing that.

00:22:47.733 --> 00:22:50.129
We had lots of applicants, you know, from the very beginning.

00:22:50.149 --> 00:22:51.901
The program grew rapidly.

00:22:52.706 --> 00:22:54.115
Too rapidly, I think.

00:22:55.242 --> 00:22:58.686
Or faculty to staff it.

00:22:58.706 --> 00:23:14.884
And the school of, as the name is changed to Texas A&M University in 64 and 5, then what had been the School of Arts and Sciences is changed.

00:23:15.805 --> 00:23:18.988
Describe what happened that related to y'all.

00:23:20.605 --> 00:23:23.388
Well, I don't remember exactly how.

00:23:23.408 --> 00:23:24.969
It was kind of fuzzy in my mind.

00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:27.172
It never really affected me much.

00:23:27.212 --> 00:23:30.475
You know, I just kept teaching my courses in testing and measurements.

00:23:30.715 --> 00:23:34.459
I didn't continue to teach those general psychology courses very long.

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:38.463
My second semester I started teaching statistics, I believe.

00:23:38.583 --> 00:23:39.925
I don't remember teaching the first.

00:23:39.985 --> 00:23:48.874
And from then on, every semester I taught one or two or maybe more, but usually at least always at least one course in statistics.

00:23:48.854 --> 00:23:50.659
And what was the general content of that?

00:23:51.401 --> 00:23:58.459
I tried to get into that.

00:23:59.671 --> 00:24:03.796
enough that would be useful to a person that didn't take any other course in statistics.

00:24:04.977 --> 00:24:07.861
Try to make it an in course for some people.

00:24:08.441 --> 00:24:12.426
But also try to make it so it would be an entry to go in further in statistics.

00:24:12.686 --> 00:24:17.732
That was a pretty tough thing to do, but that's what I tried to do, and I think I did accomplish that.

00:24:18.373 --> 00:24:22.658
So I came to be teaching statistics as my main subject, really.

00:24:22.958 --> 00:24:28.223
And that got me into a lot of trouble because I was called on to be on almost every committee.

00:24:29.084 --> 00:24:35.071
I estimate I was over 1,000 committees in every department, not just my own department.

00:24:35.971 --> 00:24:42.338
And then another thing that happened is back in those days, that was long before personal computers.

00:24:43.339 --> 00:24:45.501
And it was kind of tricky to get into the computer.

00:24:45.521 --> 00:24:47.183
You know, everybody shared the same computer.

00:24:48.084 --> 00:24:50.046
And I happened to be one of those that

00:24:51.157 --> 00:24:55.944
was anointed to be a gatekeeper for the computer.

00:24:56.005 --> 00:25:07.643
And so that's how I spent many of my days and some of my nights helping people run things through the computer for statistical analysis primarily.

00:25:07.843 --> 00:25:13.131
How long before you directed some dissertations and theses?

00:25:13.972 --> 00:25:21.006
The very first time we had it, you know, I think it was 63 or 64, I immediately started to do that.

00:25:21.086 --> 00:25:22.830
I was the chairman for Camel Mog Robbie.

00:25:23.311 --> 00:25:24.794
Okay.

00:25:24.814 --> 00:25:26.597
So you were the chairman for the first one.

00:25:26.777 --> 00:25:28.781
That's right, and many others.

00:25:28.922 --> 00:25:34.613
But I really didn't, I tried to keep it so that I didn't share

00:25:34.897 --> 00:25:38.601
too many committees, but I was on lots of committees.

00:25:39.322 --> 00:25:40.363
That's the way it turned out.

00:25:43.027 --> 00:25:44.508
But I did chair a lot of them too.

00:25:44.949 --> 00:25:53.899
Describe Frank Hubert's role in leading education forward so skillfully.

00:25:55.261 --> 00:25:59.706
Describe him as a person from the faculty member's point of view and so forth.

00:26:01.762 --> 00:26:05.070
Make believe I'd never seen him or knew anybody.

00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:06.032
That's kind of hard to do.

00:26:06.293 --> 00:26:08.337
Make believe I'm a stranger.

00:26:09.059 --> 00:26:16.817
Well, actually, I never had just a real close personal relationship with him.

00:26:17.101 --> 00:26:20.307
He was a little bit, in my mind, distant.

00:26:21.229 --> 00:26:24.334
But I always had tremendous respect for his ability.

00:26:24.976 --> 00:26:28.983
I always thought that he knew what he was doing and he knew how to do it.

00:26:29.003 --> 00:26:31.348
We were in real good hands.

00:26:31.388 --> 00:26:32.570
I never doubted that at all.

00:26:33.552 --> 00:26:38.080
And I always thought, too, that if I did have a problem,

00:26:39.173 --> 00:26:43.900
at that level, that I could go to him and he would listen, you know, and he would be fair.

00:26:44.822 --> 00:26:46.004
It didn't happen very often.

00:26:47.125 --> 00:26:57.922
I didn't get to test it much, but I, my impressions of him are very positive.

00:26:58.563 --> 00:27:00.827
Now, I have heard some

00:27:01.195 --> 00:27:14.882
criticism mostly from people that didn't know him as well as I did, you know, he's very, not very friendly or kind of ruthless maybe even, something like that.

00:27:14.902 --> 00:27:16.365
But I don't believe that at all.

00:27:16.786 --> 00:27:21.195
That does not fit my knowledge of him at all.

00:27:21.226 --> 00:27:23.090
As far as you know, he was well informed.

00:27:23.431 --> 00:27:23.992
Absolutely.

00:27:24.853 --> 00:27:32.389
And I think he had the welfare of the university and the college and the department always at heart.

00:27:33.191 --> 00:27:35.535
And who was his key secretary?

00:27:36.578 --> 00:27:39.724
That would be Peggy Ritchie.

00:27:41.864 --> 00:27:43.186
And was she well organized?

00:27:43.606 --> 00:27:45.288
Absolutely, very well organized.

00:27:45.969 --> 00:27:47.291
You know the answer to that, huh?

00:27:47.311 --> 00:27:48.692
Yes, yes, yes.

00:27:48.712 --> 00:27:50.274
I still see Peggy occasionally.

00:27:50.534 --> 00:27:55.540
I haven't interviewed her, but I'm writing that she's one of the people that I really want to get to.

00:27:56.982 --> 00:27:59.285
In your first years...

00:27:59.305 --> 00:28:01.067
I see Willis once in a while, too, her husband.

00:28:01.868 --> 00:28:07.635
In your first years here, who were the key assistant or associate deans?

00:28:09.623 --> 00:28:10.425
Let me see.

00:28:10.906 --> 00:28:12.831
You mean in my field or in any field?

00:28:13.753 --> 00:28:14.535
In my field.

00:28:17.421 --> 00:28:19.125
There weren't as many then, of course.

00:28:20.569 --> 00:28:24.578
Hmm.

00:28:25.030 --> 00:28:27.554
But at first, he was doing it himself.

00:28:28.475 --> 00:28:30.799
And then later, he gets McCandless.

00:28:30.819 --> 00:28:31.940
But that's a good while.

00:28:32.221 --> 00:28:34.764
Yeah, that's right.

00:28:34.784 --> 00:28:35.465
He had McCandless.

00:28:35.485 --> 00:28:36.868
And then McCandless went with arts.

00:28:36.948 --> 00:28:43.437
And when it was divided into liberal arts and education, well, McCandless went with liberal arts.

00:28:44.579 --> 00:28:48.224
At one time, Lannis Holt was in the dean's office.

00:28:49.406 --> 00:28:51.409
And let's see.

00:28:52.621 --> 00:28:56.325
And, of course, Lannis and I have been real good friends all along.

00:28:57.026 --> 00:28:58.467
He came shortly after I did.

00:28:58.507 --> 00:29:03.753
And, of course, he was not teaching in our department, but part-time.

00:29:03.793 --> 00:29:06.016
He was in the Counseling and Testing Center.

00:29:06.616 --> 00:29:07.757
Same way with Austin Curley.

00:29:07.978 --> 00:29:09.860
And he also had some Waco background.

00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:10.420
That's right.

00:29:10.641 --> 00:29:11.161
Yes, he did.

00:29:12.463 --> 00:29:21.092
Now, am I correct that what had been Arts and Sciences was divided

00:29:23.603 --> 00:29:31.131
And into liberal arts but that first included education.

00:29:31.191 --> 00:29:32.012
Yes, that's right.

00:29:32.232 --> 00:29:33.013
With Hubert.

00:29:33.033 --> 00:29:33.273
Yes.

00:29:33.774 --> 00:29:41.081
Then that was divided and liberal arts became a separate unit and Hubert stayed with education.

00:29:41.101 --> 00:29:43.424
That's correct, that's right.

00:29:43.444 --> 00:29:51.332
And by, you all were still officing in the academic building but his office was downstairs

00:29:51.413 --> 00:29:53.015
then in academic, wasn't it?

00:29:53.336 --> 00:29:55.699
The dean of arts and, dean of education.

00:29:56.641 --> 00:29:57.542
Didn't.

00:29:57.562 --> 00:30:05.294
I don't remember, let me see, Dean Hubert, I remember him mostly being over here in Bolton Hall pretty early.

00:30:05.574 --> 00:30:06.235
Nagel.

00:30:06.356 --> 00:30:06.916
Nagel too?

00:30:06.996 --> 00:30:07.317
Nagel.

00:30:07.678 --> 00:30:08.799
But at one time he was in.

00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:10.121
Was he in Bolton?

00:30:10.141 --> 00:30:11.003
No, no, not Bolton.

00:30:11.043 --> 00:30:13.046
What is this building we're in now, the other end of it?

00:30:13.366 --> 00:30:13.727
Cushing?

00:30:13.807 --> 00:30:14.388
Cushing, yes.

00:30:14.788 --> 00:30:15.970
He was in Cushing.

00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:16.981
A lot.

00:30:18.543 --> 00:30:26.073
But I think I remember for a while he was at the east end of the first floor of Academic.

00:30:26.093 --> 00:30:28.476
I don't remember that, Haskell.

00:30:28.496 --> 00:30:34.384
When a young man named Cole was his errand runner, I think.

00:30:34.684 --> 00:30:37.688
I don't remember that, but it could very well be.

00:30:37.938 --> 00:30:45.873
And then we, for a while, we moved to, I believe it is Bolton Hall that we did move to for a while.

00:30:45.974 --> 00:30:48.919
Is it over here by the Century Oak?

00:30:49.641 --> 00:30:51.023
Right, we were in there for a while.

00:30:51.063 --> 00:30:52.386
My office was in there.

00:30:52.636 --> 00:31:04.724
And then for a while our departmental office, I was still there, and our departmental office was in this little red building over here, right off the parking lot of the academic building.

00:31:04.845 --> 00:31:05.947
I can't remember.

00:31:06.448 --> 00:31:07.150
Bagley, I think.

00:31:07.170 --> 00:31:08.012
Yeah, Bagley Hall.

00:31:08.794 --> 00:31:10.999
In the early 60s,
