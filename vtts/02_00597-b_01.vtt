WEBVTT

00:01.887 --> 00:04.270
April 17, 1986. This is a test.

00:10.256 --> 00:13.160
Today is April 17, 1986. This is Terry Anderson. 
I'm interviewing Frank Wilkinson about his life

00:15.382 --> 00:22.871
as a civil libertarian. Now, you've been involved 
in that for 40 years, well, since the 1940s, maybe

00:22.891 --> 00:31.000
since the 1930s. Could you tell us something about 
your early years? How did

00:35.205 --> 00:40.310
you get involved with that? What in your early 
years contributed to the fact that you became so

00:40.430 --> 00:50.961
involved in the First Amendment, the U.S. 
Constitution?

00:50.981 --> 00:59.130
I believe that I would mark 1942, spring of 1942, 
when I first became active in civil liberties and

01:00.005 --> 01:04.950
civil rights work. At that time I was 28. I was born 
in 1914. I was born in a resort town in northern

01:08.174 --> 01:14.641
Michigan, Charlevoix, Michigan. Moved to 
Arizona briefly from when I was 3 until 10. And then

01:22.249 --> 01:29.657
moved to Beverly Hills, California through grade 
school, high school, through UCLA. My father was a

01:31.358 --> 01:48.016
medical doctor, a graduate of Ann Arbor, who was 
assigned to Arizona during World War I, and then he

01:31.358 --> 01:48.016
went into private practice in Hollywood in Los 
Angeles, Beverly Hills, in 1925.

01:51.660 --> 01:56.185
The question was, what do I attribute to my 
interest?

02:02.898 --> 02:29.665
I believe that in terms of the ethics which I 
follow, which I think I would describe today as

02:02.898 --> 02:29.665
being essentially materialist,

02:02.898 --> 02:29.665
that I think the ethics of my upbringing in some 
respects are more basic than a more economic or

02:02.898 --> 02:29.665
material analysis that I might have of history 
today. I was brought up in a very wonderful family,

02:32.885 --> 02:41.815
the youngest of four children. My brother and 
sister both became medical doctors. We were

02:49.203 --> 02:56.411
active in the Methodist Church from the time I can 
first remember all the way through college. My

02:58.053 --> 03:00.175
father was the president of the Protestant Men's 
Movement of Southern California. And my whole

03:04.559 --> 03:12.128
life was put into the Methodist Church from the 
primary grade school, high school, everything.

03:15.531 --> 03:29.807
Somewhere around the beginning of my work at UCLA, 
my undergraduate work at UCLA, beginning in 1932,

03:15.531 --> 03:29.807
I went from just the perspective limited 
perspective of the Methodist Church, to become

03:30.783 --> 03:44.516
the chair of the board of a group called the 
Religious Conference Student Board at UCLA. The

03:45.476 --> 03:58.208
board is set up by the National Conference of 
Christians and Jews, whereby Catholics,

03:45.476 --> 03:58.208
Protestants, Jews, free thinkers for that 
matter, shared the same building. had offices all

03:59.335 --> 04:01.879
but in a common building. That was a very valuable 
influence on my life because I had really never met

04:02.821 --> 04:10.793
anybody except a Methodist, I think, up until that 
time.

04:16.703 --> 04:21.270
Politically, the family was very conservative.

04:25.157 --> 04:26.659
I was the head of for Herbert Hoover in Beverly 
Hills High School, but the issue there was a

04:27.247 --> 04:35.055
Methodist issue. Hoover was a dry, and Roosevelt 
was a wet.

04:44.825 --> 04:46.447
My father was a prohibitionist.

04:49.430 --> 04:56.157
I also was the first president of the Hollywood 
Young People's of the Women's Christian Templars

04:56.677 --> 05:09.813
Union, the WCTU, which was formed in the Methodist 
Church South in Hollywood, which is the southern

04:56.677 --> 05:09.813
branch of the Methodist Church, not my own 
Hollywood Methodist Church.

05:12.696 --> 05:25.772
All

05:12.696 --> 05:25.772
the way through UCLA,

05:12.696 --> 05:25.772
I was primarily active as a leader in the Sigma 
Alpha Epsilon In fact, I had been pledged to SAE

05:26.748 --> 05:32.477
while I was still at Beverly Hills High School. My 
brother and my brother-in-law had been SAE. And I

05:38.285 --> 05:55.050
was a very promising campus political person, and 
so the inducement to get me to join SAE while I was

05:38.285 --> 05:55.050
still in high school was that the politics of the 
fraternities at UCLA so controlled by the

05:55.570 --> 06:09.564
fraternities and sororities that they could tell 
me that four years from the time I entered that SAE

05:55.570 --> 06:09.564
was due to become the fraternity that would 
produce the student body president. Well, I was

06:09.784 --> 06:17.331
literally offered student body presidency at 
UCLA four years from the time I matriculated. And

06:17.371 --> 06:24.058
so everything was done to advance me politically 
on campus to develop my name recognition.

06:30.876 --> 06:38.106
I probably was a good student, but I was much more 
interested in social life.

06:42.091 --> 06:54.889
I'm eighty percent deaf, probably about forty 
percent deaf at that time,

06:42.091 --> 06:54.889
and I was so vain that I was afraid that if I wore a 
hearing aid that I wouldn't be popular on the

06:56.540 --> 07:05.267
campus or with women. So I went all the way through 
UCLA without hearing a lecture.

07:14.836 --> 07:17.618
Some jokes about that nowadays. The reason I 
turned out all right is that I didn't hear what they

07:17.638 --> 07:20.961
were teaching. But the whole thing was satisfying 
my popularity needs, personality needs. But back

07:34.040 --> 07:43.711
of all this was this very, very strong sense of a 
Methodist conscience,

07:34.040 --> 07:43.711
whatever that means. There was no challenge to a 
social gospel that I held until after I got out of

07:44.451 --> 07:56.685
UCLA, except questions like, the moral issues 
like drinking and dancing and smoking and that

07:58.285 --> 08:05.816
kind of an issue. I didn't drink, I didn't smoke, I 
didn't, those were just moral issues that were

08:07.639 --> 08:18.996
involved in my background. I was pretty active in 
sports. I ran a mile in cross country. at Beverly

08:27.597 --> 08:43.052
Hills High School, and I rode on the first UCLA 
crew, the eight orange shells, my first person in

08:27.597 --> 08:43.052
my sophomore year.

08:49.838 --> 08:56.845
When the election came for student body president 
in 1935, there had been a move made somewhere on

08:57.972 --> 09:13.786
campus, probably by the administration,

08:57.972 --> 09:13.786
to require that all students had to become voting 
members of the associated student body.

09:16.868 --> 09:27.017
From 32 to 35, the only people who joined the ASUC 
were essentially the fraternities and

09:16.868 --> 09:27.017
sororities. representing about 2,200 students, 
I imagine. On 35, the franchise was given to all

09:32.637 --> 09:45.291
students

09:32.637 --> 09:45.291
as a compulsory part of the fees of matriculation.

09:48.014 --> 09:55.722
And so the whole plan to have me student body 
president was suddenly confronted with the fact

09:48.014 --> 09:55.722
that the majority of the students on campus were no 
longer in fraternities and sororities. Exactly.

10:00.235 --> 10:01.156
The voters. The voters. And the university under 
the provost, Ernest Carroll Moore, was alarmed

10:03.519 --> 10:12.949
about this. He had a lot of confidence in the 
fraternities and sororities, and particularly

10:13.670 --> 10:23.380
in me, and was fearful of the radical students. on 
campus to non-organizational students. Each

10:27.919 --> 10:36.727
year the appropriation for the university was 
subject to question due to some incipient radical

10:27.919 --> 10:36.727
activities at UCLA.

10:39.250 --> 10:50.481
So an arrangement was made whereby I was running 
against a rather popular non-organizational

10:39.250 --> 10:50.481
student

10:39.250 --> 10:50.481
and The administration wanted every way possible 
to have me defeat him. So two things were done.

10:58.840 --> 11:08.796
First of all, the administration for the first 
time had a major conference on the question of war

10:58.840 --> 11:08.796
or peace, 1935. This was four years before the 
outbreak of World War II. There was a great deal of

11:13.143 --> 11:18.392
pacifism, and the university was concerned about 
pacifism. I was a religious pacifist, not an

11:19.840 --> 11:28.889
economic or radical pacifist.

11:28.909 --> 11:34.315
And so the administration arranged for me to 
debate this non-organization student.

11:37.118 --> 11:45.046
So the public was here, both of us together, the 
administration hoping that I would come out ahead

11:37.118 --> 11:45.046
and be popular and be elected. At the same time, 
some of the non-organizational students started

11:49.591 --> 12:06.877
to have forums

11:49.591 --> 12:06.877
on campus which, contrary to university 
regulations,

11:49.591 --> 12:06.877
had no faculty sponsorship. The university 
required all campus organizations to have

12:06.897 --> 12:19.395
faculty sponsorship, and these forums were 
deliberately in the face of that, to have no

12:06.897 --> 12:19.395
faculty involved, just student-operated open 
forums

12:19.949 --> 12:48.522
and the administration was against that and I 
think I was against that but the man who I was

12:19.949 --> 12:48.522
running for student body president was one of the 
leaders in that so the administration saw the

12:19.949 --> 12:48.522
opportunity to eliminate almost you might say the 
opposition to me by expelling those students who

12:19.949 --> 12:48.522
were in the non-faculty represented forums. And 
about a month before the election, they held a

12:54.320 --> 13:04.792
forum, and five students were expelled, 
including the candidate against me for student

12:54.320 --> 13:04.792
body president. So I was then a shoe-in.

13:09.157 --> 13:16.686
Two weeks before the election,

13:09.157 --> 13:16.686
enormous student protests developed. the 
administration was forced to back down and

13:17.628 --> 13:23.356
reinstate the students. And when the election 
came, I was wiped out.

13:29.164 --> 13:30.385
They had made another martyr.

13:33.129 --> 13:36.073
Interesting about who the five students were that 
were expelled. I've often thought about them.

13:38.236 --> 13:46.808
First of all, the man—we were labeling all these 
people communists or radicals, very The man I was

13:47.986 --> 13:54.654
running against became a law professor at a small 
college down in Florida. He, I think today, is the

13:57.076 --> 14:03.243
executive director of the Trial Lawyers 
Association of America. Very successful, very

14:04.185 --> 14:08.429
affluent lawyer. Another one is a corporation 
lawyer in Beverly Hills. A third one, who had been

14:16.775 --> 14:42.248
the student body president the year before, half a 
year before, became a United States Army general

14:16.775 --> 14:42.248
and became the, was the director of the Army War 
College in Washington, D.C. A fourth one

14:16.775 --> 14:42.248
went to work for Jimmy Hoffa and the Teamsters 
Union. It was a right-hand man, Jimmy Hoffa. He was

14:46.019 --> 14:53.008
killed in some Teamster fire situation some years 
ago. And there was a fifth or a sixth was a woman,

14:54.930 --> 15:01.940
Celeste Strack, and she did become a communist. 
Very interesting. And today, is that

15:04.703 --> 15:13.174
the 36th? Fifty years. Fifty years ago. Fifty 
years to the day. I now have served one year in the

15:16.133 --> 15:25.045
federal prison on a First Amendment challenge of 
the Un-American Activities Committee. Sure. In a

15:27.909 --> 15:41.727
lawsuit, the American Civil Liberties Union, 
Southern California, is sponsoring on behalf of

15:27.909 --> 15:41.727
myself and Carl, the National Committee Against 
Repressive Legislation, NCARL, We've learned in

15:43.681 --> 16:09.823
the last six years that my life was followed and 
altered

15:43.681 --> 16:09.823
by surveillance and disruption by the FBI from 
1942,

15:43.681 --> 16:09.823
when I really took my first social concern stand, 
until 1980. In the federal district court in Los

16:10.782 --> 16:25.655
Angeles last month, the FBI admitted to the judge 
that they have 132,000 pages of surveillance on me

16:10.782 --> 16:25.655
from 1940 to 1980. And the law firm handling this, 
which I, my own choice, I had the contacts. It's the

16:34.443 --> 16:38.967
second largest Republican law firm in LA, lobe and 
lobe. made up, younger people particularly, have

16:41.022 --> 16:46.650
made up with I think this day would characterize as 
yuppies. They're really getting an education.

16:51.878 --> 16:57.446
They're handling this all pro bono as volunteer 
council for ACNU of Southern California. And we

16:58.808 --> 17:06.078
estimate that the FBI spent 17 million dollars on 
surveillance on me from 1942 to 1980. And we have a

17:07.000 --> 17:10.725
lawsuit now against the FBI claiming $16 million 
in damages, as well as injunctive relief to stop it

17:11.279 --> 17:22.292
from happening anymore, not only to me, but to the 
next generations. I think it's interesting, is

17:24.074 --> 17:38.170
that those who are considered most radical, 
communist, and the kind of witch hunts of the 30s,

17:24.074 --> 17:38.170
have turned out to be very conservatives. And I, 
who was the most conservative. Youth for Herbert

17:42.016 --> 17:49.724
Hoover, Sigma Alpha Epsilon for Trinity type, 
that turned out to be the liberal. That is

17:52.087 --> 17:53.028
interesting. I

17:53.749 --> 18:00.936
wanted to ask you something along those same 
lines. In 1942, you began your career along the

18:00.976 --> 18:10.547
civil liberties side. What happened between that 
period of 36 when you graduated from college, when

18:11.033 --> 18:26.550
you were the

18:11.033 --> 18:26.550
more conservative candidate, and by the time you 
went in 1942? What were some of the variables that

18:27.010 --> 18:36.020
came together that obviously disillusioned you 
or made you much more of a social activist? Six year

18:36.040 --> 18:38.863
period.

18:39.856 --> 18:41.057
turnaround in my life. It came about as a result of a 
decision I made in the last year of UCLA. I'd always

18:53.268 --> 18:56.852
thought about it, but I finally decided to become a 
Methodist minister.

18:59.714 --> 19:03.658
I was quite influenced by a pledge brother of mine, 
named Lloyd Bridges. He later became a motion

19:03.678 --> 19:07.181
picture actor, Bud Bridges. He was my pledge 
brother. And,

19:10.484 --> 19:28.060
interesting enough, Lloyd Bridges became an 
informer for the Un-American Activities

19:10.484 --> 19:28.060
Committee in the 40's, and apparently became a 
radical, after I knew him at UCLA. Did he inform on

19:30.202 --> 19:32.384
you? No. He didn't know me except for my fraternity 
brother. He informed on people in the motion

19:38.564 --> 19:40.966
picture industry. I

19:41.207 --> 19:56.061
guess with this type of a history, an anecdote, not 
an anecdote, but a specific will give you the

19:41.207 --> 19:56.061
measure of what I was like. During Halloween

19:57.382 --> 20:08.132
1933, we'll say, when I was about ready to go out of 
being a pledge to becoming a regular member of

19:57.382 --> 20:08.132
S.A.E. They put us through a great, very rigorous 
strain, no sleep for seven days, all kinds of

20:09.209 --> 20:21.004
nonsense, and work. And the last night, they sat us 
down, Bud and me and four or five others who were

20:21.926 --> 20:38.507
being blinged, and gave us a sheet of paper with 
blank words missing.

20:38.690 --> 20:42.093
ask us to fill it out in ten minutes, not to talk to 
each other. When I looked at this,

20:43.915 --> 20:52.945
every blank word had to do with sexual 
relationship with a woman. Here, I'm a virgin and

20:54.466 --> 21:00.012
never had intercourse. I never had intercourse 
while I was at UCLA. Very unusual for this

21:04.436 --> 21:06.098
generation. But I looked at these words, I knew the 
words, I never used them, but I recognized the

21:07.867 --> 21:15.595
blank spaces. And though in great fatigue, I 
filled in the blanks, holding up to the last

21:17.017 --> 21:26.247
minute, and then they pressed me, and I just 
hurried through and filled it in real quick. When I

21:27.508 --> 21:35.477
came in an hour later to the final meeting with the 
Supreme Archon, the leaders of the National

21:27.508 --> 21:35.477
Fraternity who were there, They were welcoming me 
into the fraternity. How wonderful it was to get a

21:38.807 --> 21:42.451
Methodist leader like me. And it was just all 
laudatory, but I was on a bright light on my face, a

21:44.453 --> 21:53.982
bleak light on my face, and they were all in the dark 
in the back of the room. I could not see anybody. It

21:55.764 --> 21:58.847
was kind of a third-degree atmosphere. And then I 
heard this voice say, well, wait a minute. What's

22:02.551 --> 22:03.031
this? What's this? This man didn't write that. I 
thought you said he was a Methodist. And he went

22:10.265 --> 22:12.688
through my overhearing. And finally a voice came 
out and said, Frank, I am deeply shocked. I cannot

22:19.135 --> 22:20.016
believe. Did you sign this paper? Is this your 
handwriting? And I admitted that I had. And I

22:30.307 --> 22:33.831
apologized and said I was very tired. And at that 
point, I was told I'd been rejected from

22:35.465 --> 22:45.477
membership in SAA, and I broke down and I began to 
cry. And then they suddenly turned on the lights,

22:45.517 --> 22:53.626
told me it was all a joke, and I was welcomed into the 
fraternity. I cried for an hour after that. The

22:57.651 --> 22:58.852
shock was so great. The embarrassment was so great 
from having written those words and being called

23:04.287 --> 23:10.495
on it and being denied membership in the 
fraternity. I remember walking up and down with

23:11.657 --> 23:14.000
Bud Bridges. He tried his best to stop me from 
crying. I just sobbed and sobbed and sobbed. About

23:20.829 --> 23:28.018
that time of the following year, before we 
graduated, Bud was saying, Frank, you really

23:20.829 --> 23:28.018
ought to become a Methodist minister. And I really 
thought I should, too. Now, this episode put in

23:35.017 --> 23:37.861
without your request. I'm leaning up to the fact 
that in the summer of 36, as a graduation present

23:39.483 --> 23:53.742
from my family, I was given enough money to make a 
pilgrimage to Bethlehem in Jerusalem.

23:56.325 --> 24:02.914
The idea would be I'd go to the Holy Land in old 
Palestine and visit and then come back and begin

23:56.325 --> 24:02.914
graduate work. for the Methodist ministry. It was 
a wonderful opportunity. And with another

24:08.471 --> 24:15.941
fraternity brother who was also studying for the 
ministry, we set off for the Holy Land in the summer

24:08.471 --> 24:15.941
of 36. I had never seen any poverty in my life at that 
point. That was the seventh year of the American

24:26.334 --> 24:29.138
Depression.

24:34.130 --> 24:35.812
I didn't know there were any poor people. I didn't 
know there had been a depression. Didn't you read

24:38.234 --> 24:39.476
the newspapers?

24:42.099 --> 24:47.324
I don't have any reaction on that to me from the 
newspapers. I certainly read the newspapers, but

24:47.384 --> 24:51.129
not too much. I remember the newspapers at that 
time, I remember so much the only times attacking

24:51.149 --> 25:01.880
Upton Sinclair for being an atheist. I remember 
when he was running for governor of California. My

25:05.216 --> 25:14.888
father was very active in political campaigns, 
like conservative Republican governors,

25:05.216 --> 25:14.888
Republican mayors, things of that kind. I just 
didn't know about it. I, every Saturday and Sunday

25:18.072 --> 25:28.685
night, I was dancing and never thought of going out 
without a tuxedo or tails. Always dressed up,

25:29.606 --> 25:32.470
always having a good time. little contradiction 
between that and not drinking. I never drank, I

25:37.682 --> 25:43.867
never smoked, but I went out dancing all the time. 
Anyway,

25:46.169 --> 25:55.257
I started across the country. I got one 
introduction to the problem in December January

26:02.437 --> 26:03.619
1935-36. For as the head of the University 
Religious Conference, the Rausch and Bush

26:04.140 --> 26:29.638
Fellowship at UCLA, which is a Baptist group, 
invited me to represent the student board of the

26:04.140 --> 26:29.638
Religious Conference to come to a weekend seminar 
at Asilomar, Northern California, the YWCA

26:04.140 --> 26:29.638
encampment. I didn't know what it was all about, 
When I got up there, I found out that we were going to

26:31.276 --> 26:42.030
have a seminar on the life and work of Jane Adams, 
the settlement house worker from Hull House in

26:31.276 --> 26:42.030
Chicago. And a woman named Muriel Lester, who was a 
settlement house worker from London, was there to

26:43.832 --> 26:50.280
lead us. And a man named Kagawa from a similar 
problem, slum work in Tokyo. was supposed to come.

27:03.735 --> 27:09.721
And we sat there and for two days we heard about the 
wonderful life of this woman working among the

27:03.735 --> 27:09.721
poor in Chicago. And I decided when I started for 
the Holy Land that I wanted to see this problem. I

27:16.348 --> 27:17.649
wanted to see poor people. I was deeply moved by 
what I heard. And my whole Christian upbringing

27:22.394 --> 27:29.582
was to want to do something about the poor.

27:30.102 --> 27:35.169
The first stop on my trip east was to go into 
Chicago, look up Hull House. I came upon Maxwell

27:35.890 --> 27:41.218
Street in Chicago in the summer of 1936.

27:43.521 --> 27:49.250
There were tens of thousands of people who were 
begging. Poverty I'd never seen in my life.

27:55.298 --> 27:56.801
Unbelievable poverty. People eating out of 
garbage cans.

28:01.270 --> 28:04.973
I put in the first ten days I was in Chicago. I spent 
all the money that I had budgeted for my first three

28:05.654 --> 28:18.466
months of my traveling by taking people literally 
out of garbage cans and bringing them around to the

28:05.654 --> 28:18.466
front of the store and buying them a ten-cent meal. 
I had to go through a week

28:20.268 --> 28:31.058
before I realized that my dimes were not making an 
impact on the problem.

28:31.308 --> 28:33.491
There's detail on that we don't need. I think what 
you want me to give you is our hurried summer here. I

28:38.117 --> 28:41.921
went from Chicago... Well, that must have had a 
tremendous impact. That was a changing point.

28:44.945 --> 28:46.327
That was a changing point. You feel that was the 
single most important episode then? That was the

28:49.771 --> 28:52.875
first important episode. But from then on, the 
attitude... There was an author at that time

28:56.780 --> 29:00.505
called Richard Halliburton. who'd written a book 
about the royal road to romance. While I was on the

29:05.333 --> 29:25.312
way to the Holy Land and all that, I was deeply 
influenced by the idea of going around the world on

29:05.333 --> 29:25.312
a dollar a day, using a sleeping bag, following the 
route of Hannibal over the Alps, swimming the

29:05.333 --> 29:25.312
Bosphorus, all the things that Halliburton did. 
It's kind of a smart idea, a junket, fun trip, as

29:25.332 --> 29:30.897
well as going to the Holy Land. All of that 
lightheadedness went out in Chicago. From then on

29:37.937 --> 29:55.499
I was just totally changed and almost driven, I 
think, to what you'd have to say almost like

29:37.937 --> 29:55.499
wanting to simulate the life of the poorest of the 
poor. I went into Chicago and I'd heard about all my

30:00.847 --> 30:01.508
life. I'd heard about the Bowery. The Bowery is a 
song. And poor people. Well, I went into the

30:09.015 --> 30:14.580
Bowery, and I came upon the Flophouses of the 
Bowery. And I moved in for a month to live in the

30:15.521 --> 30:24.469
Flophouses of the Bowery, trying to, again, just 
live the life of male derelicts. And then there was

30:25.530 --> 30:27.732
overwhelming problems.

30:30.547 --> 30:32.871
This was a second experience. Meanwhile, my 
family back in L.A. were absolutely horrified at

30:32.891 --> 30:38.539
the letters I was writing home. They sent my older 
sister back to pick up a new Packard, which was a car

30:40.162 --> 30:49.396
that had been manufactured in Detroit. Come back 
to Detroit, pick up a new Packard, come into New

30:49.416 --> 30:57.128
York with a foster sister, find me, and bring me 
home. with the understanding that I could start

30:57.833 --> 31:03.802
over again and travel, as they would have probably 
said, like a Wilkinson should travel. My sister

31:06.266 --> 31:12.456
had only a post office box in the Lower East Side of 
New York to find me. Then she did locate me, and she

31:13.397 --> 31:25.596
moved into the fanciest hotel in New York, and by 
communication we made a date to meet in her hotel

31:13.397 --> 31:25.596
room.

31:27.635 --> 31:29.537
I'm giving you details you don't need. No, I want to 
hear this. They

31:30.739 --> 31:44.975
wanted me to come home, and I was telling them that I 
was seeing a world that I'd never seen before, the

31:30.739 --> 31:44.975
real world. And I was seeing Christianity in an 
entirely different way than we were brought up. I

31:52.523 --> 31:56.848
really felt a challenge, not to just say the 
building the kingdom of God on earth as you would in

31:57.250 --> 32:03.576
a Lord's Prayer on a Sunday, but you practice it. It 
was the desire to practice the teachings of Christ

32:04.697 --> 32:08.961
that moved me. So I did not return home with her, and 
there were some experiences there. We were a very

32:14.606 --> 32:18.149
close family, but I would not go home. And I managed 
to catch a freighter, and the freighter out of New

32:24.554 --> 32:25.195
York. I didn't care where I went. I'd go to 
Palestine either by way of Asia or through the

32:26.437 --> 32:32.606
Mediterranean. I didn't care. Hopefully the 
Mediterranean. But I tried both every day, trying

32:36.572 --> 32:39.557
to get a job working on a freighter. And I finally 
got on a Norwegian freighter, which I thought had

32:39.857 --> 32:44.144
been going to Norway. Turns out it was going to 
Marseilles, France. And when we got across the

32:48.050 --> 32:51.996
Atlantic, eleven days of travel, The boat 
accidentally dropped me in a small

32:53.022 --> 33:00.748
poverty-stricken fishing village in northern 
Portugal. It was not even a dock, not a harbor. The

33:03.411 --> 33:10.617
boat's carrying some supplies in by flat bottom 
barges from the ocean, from the ocean. And then I

33:12.899 --> 33:16.362
was put off the boat. They needed the space where I 
was sleeping. They needed it for business

33:19.164 --> 33:22.827
purposes. So here I am in Portugal, which I learned 
for the first time was under a totalitarian

33:23.971 --> 33:35.546
regime, a man named Salazar. And I'm trying to get 
to the Holy Land, and the war in Spain has been going

33:37.508 --> 33:43.075
for four months. And you cannot go through Spain, 
you cannot go around to North Africa because all

33:43.496 --> 33:53.809
the boats were being sunk.

33:56.911 --> 34:05.343
And I went into the embassy, American embassy in 
Lisbon, to try to get some help. And I had fantastic

34:06.205 --> 34:08.248
credentials. The number one thing I had was a cable 
address for the Bank of America for $10,000 on

34:09.329 --> 34:17.261
call. That was a lot of money in those days. Oh, 
absolutely. And then I had a letter from the mayor,

34:20.826 --> 34:26.715
and the governor, and the police chief, and the 
sheriff and the president of the university, all

34:26.932 --> 34:33.298
personal letters in terms of my family and me. I 
turned these all into them, and by pure luck there

34:34.900 --> 34:52.457
were a group of Portuguese sportsmen, friends of 
Franco, who they knew, who were going in to spend

34:34.900 --> 34:52.457
the weekend with Franco in Seville. And they had a 
big limousine, and they called and got permission

34:57.712 --> 35:07.464
for me and my friend to ride with him, and get 
through to Seville and then go down to Gibraltar

34:57.712 --> 35:07.464
from Seville, to cut across the southern end of 
Spain. Your friend was still with you? Oh, yeah. He

35:11.149 --> 35:14.353
was going through changes, but not the same.

35:17.757 --> 35:25.026
So I found myself entering Spain in the fourth 
month of the Civil War with these wealthy

35:17.757 --> 35:25.026
sportsmen, friends of Franco. At that time, I 
mean, Spain was a civil war. Franco was fighting

35:31.261 --> 35:34.504
the Communists. That was the way I saw it. I get in 
there and I find almost no Spanish troops, all

35:37.688 --> 35:44.917
German, Nazi, Italian fascists. Some Portuguese 
under Salazar there. And I went through, you know,

35:48.661 --> 35:53.807
miles and miles and miles through war zones where 
the villages had been torn up and blown up. And

35:58.026 --> 36:18.615
third thing, I think, this is not the way I ever 
thought about it, but I think going into these

35:58.026 --> 36:18.615
villages and seeing these, thatched roof, adobe 
shacks, and in the middle of them a large Catholic

35:58.026 --> 36:18.615
church, really struck me, the poverty and the 
church. Why? And I'm glad that I was a Methodist and

36:20.277 --> 36:24.283
not that. In other words, you were glad you were a 
Methodist and not a Catholic. I got into Seville,

36:32.016 --> 36:38.725
and the American embassy in Seville was 
absolutely horrified. They let me come in because

36:38.765 --> 36:44.533
there were no Americans left in Spain. And they got 
me out as quick as they could in a taxi cab with a

36:44.853 --> 36:54.726
reporter for the London Times who was going from 
Seville down to Gibraltar. We had to go through

36:55.330 --> 37:02.076
four different army commands to get out of the 
country, all during wartime. Very, very tricky.

37:06.861 --> 37:23.937
This reporter for the London Times told us that he 
was going to make the first report on the extent of

37:06.861 --> 37:23.937
not only Nazi and Italian influence under Franco, 
But no word of that out yet. But right in front of the

37:27.228 --> 37:33.874
American embassy was a giant Texaco oil company 
tanker. And we watched, right in front of our

37:35.276 --> 37:51.011
embassy, we watched a hundred German Nazi tanks 
pull up alongside with the pipes or hoses hung

37:35.276 --> 37:51.011
over, filling these German tanks with American 
Texaco oil. And he was reporting that. At that

37:52.933 --> 37:53.974
time, Roosevelt said we were in a policy of 
non-intervention. We were supporting either

37:56.719 --> 38:03.105
side, and we saw that it was a lie. Let's drop all 
that. I was changing hourly. Sure. I get across to

38:10.271 --> 38:14.935
Northern Africa, and I'm timing myself. My goal is 
to be in Bethlehem for Christmas Eve. This was

38:19.339 --> 38:22.341
about November 1st. So I see as much as I can. I go 
through Morocco and Algeria and Tunisia and Libya

38:26.563 --> 38:35.394
for the Gulf of Cedars. I was in Tripoli and 
Benghazi and Derna. And traveling always as poor

38:39.519 --> 38:44.866
as I could. This desire to be with the poorest of the 
poor. Traveling in boxcars with the peasantry.

38:57.269 --> 39:10.065
Anyway, I finally arrived in Egypt two days before 
Christmas and caught a train on up to Jerusalem

38:57.269 --> 39:10.065
across the Sinai Desert. And I arrived there the 
morning of Christmas Eve, December 31st. Please

39:15.872 --> 39:17.875
pardon me, December 24th. And I went immediately 
out to Bethlehem, or getting out there as quick as I

39:19.237 --> 39:24.483
can. I got out there at dusk. And when I started 
getting near the Church of the Nativity, which is,

39:27.492 --> 39:33.739
oh, I'm so thrilled with the idea. My whole idea is 
the Christmas carols, Little Town of Bethlehem,

39:33.759 --> 39:41.888
and Silent Night, Holy Night. And I get there, and I 
see these crowds and crowds of people around the

39:41.908 --> 39:46.292
entrance to the church. And I get into those crowds 
that go in there. And it turns out that 90% of these

39:49.316 --> 39:56.183
crowds were beggars, or begging of pilgrims. They 
were barefoot. They were gunnyside cloth. They

40:00.518 --> 40:08.971
were horribly, horribly poor, as poor as anything 
I saw in Morocco or Algeria or Tunisia or Libya. And

40:08.991 --> 40:11.514
they were begging for one-tenth of one cent. And I 
could not get through the crowds of beggars to get

40:12.676 --> 40:18.485
into the church Christmas Eve. And that was nearly 
the end of this whole thing. And I began

40:24.253 --> 40:26.136
formulating. Why 2,000 years of Christianity? 
Are there still such a contrast between the

40:31.892 --> 40:38.839
teachings of Christ and the practice? Or 5,000 
years of Judaism? Or 1,200 years of Muhammad of

40:41.381 --> 40:46.527
Jerusalem as the center of all three Western 
faiths? I spent three months there in the Holy

40:48.368 --> 40:50.511
Land. I'll speed this up for you. I spent three 
months there in the Holy Land struggling with my

40:52.793 --> 40:55.836
conscience. I decided early that I would not 
become a Methodist minister. I just couldn't see

41:01.234 --> 41:02.736
it. I decided I was going to take the teachings of 
Christ and either practice them every minute of my

41:04.057 --> 41:15.673
life, literally, or I was going to candidly admit 
my hypocrisy. I was going to be either a hypocrite

41:16.214 --> 41:22.903
openly or an actual practicing Christian. What I 
learned in the old city, in Jerusalem, is

41:25.043 --> 41:29.087
unbelievable. You have the tomb of Isaac and 
Abraham. You still have virgin births. The

41:37.854 --> 41:44.080
peasants believe that Sarah, the wife of Abraham, 
has influence with childbearing. So barren women

41:44.620 --> 41:51.426
come there to pray, and hopefully, as a result, God 
will give them a child. I saw it, and I was laughing.

41:53.708 --> 41:54.409
My God, it's the whole idea of the Immaculate 
Conception falls apart.

42:02.563 --> 42:07.347
By the time I left Jerusalem, I had become an 
atheist. Three months. That's incredible. I

42:10.770 --> 42:12.952
wrote a letter to Robert Gordon Sproul. Oh, I know, 
I took a bicycle. I bought a bicycle in Jerusalem.

42:17.996 --> 42:21.419
An old, old, old beaten-up bicycle. No, no, uh, 
What do you call it? Pedals. Pedals, you know, the

42:25.458 --> 42:29.703
kind that you, where you get gears, you know. Yeah, 
no gears, yeah. Just old-fashioned bicycle.

42:32.286 --> 42:32.386
Yeah. And with my fraternity brother, we decided, 
all right, let's go see Europe. So we bicycled

42:39.374 --> 42:52.189
throughout all of Palestine and all of Syria and 
Lebanon, and then through Greece and England,

42:39.374 --> 42:52.189
Ireland, Scotland, Wales, France,

42:55.105 --> 42:56.006
You know, it took a year. Covered every country in 
Europe, finally. Did your friend also become an

43:00.052 --> 43:01.894
atheist? No. He became more and more devout, a 
Christian. And we began differing, and made our

43:08.023 --> 43:14.372
travels together difficult. Very interesting 
what happened to him. Saw the same thing, same

43:16.495 --> 43:19.199
background, and react differently. Yes, that is 
interesting. He'd have me go along with him. He'd

43:22.922 --> 43:29.069
go into the various tombs where I believe Christ 
arose from the dead. He'd wait until the light

43:29.249 --> 43:37.599
would come down through the rocks and have a very 
expensive camera, and I would take a picture of him

43:29.249 --> 43:37.599
praying at Christ's tomb. He went down to the 
Jordan, and a Baptist minister baptized him in the

43:38.580 --> 43:46.009
Jordan, in the place where Christ was baptized. 
And I rode out in a boat to catch him exactly at the

43:46.530 --> 43:50.474
moment of baptism. I was his These were pictures he 
was going to take home to help him with his new

43:51.282 --> 43:58.669
ministry when he got back, by visit to the Holy 
Land. I just thought he was terrible. And, you

44:02.032 --> 44:03.813
know, we argued. At any rate, on my way from along 
the coast of Tyre and Sidon up to Beirut on bicycle,

44:05.034 --> 44:20.108
I see a sign called the American University 
outside of Beirut. And I pull in there, and I go in

44:21.168 --> 44:24.672
looking for a library. I want to see books. I 
thought I was the first person that ever doubted

44:26.935 --> 44:31.120
there was a God. And where to look? Where's the word 
God? Where can I find these things? And I wrote

44:40.411 --> 44:46.658
there, wrote a long, long letter to Robert Gordon 
Sproul, who was the president of the University of

44:40.411 --> 44:46.658
California. And I was his hope, because I was the 
conservative that was protecting the

44:50.986 --> 44:54.992
appropriations of the state legislature. And I 
wrote him, I remember writing, Dear Bob, there is

44:55.773 --> 44:59.378
no God. It's a misunderstanding of the unknown, 
and so on. I lived for three months under

45:06.048 --> 45:10.054
Mussolini, three months under Hitler. I lived in 
the ghetto of Warsaw. I saw programs in Romania. I

45:17.826 --> 45:19.508
just saw... things that no mind ever saw. I really 
got educated. I came back to L.A. a year and a half

45:23.675 --> 45:27.640
after I left. Totally changed.

45:32.887 --> 45:40.276
Totally committed to teaching the practice of 
Christianity, but not wanting to be any part of

45:32.887 --> 45:40.276
organized religion. I went back to that Hollywood 
Methodist Church, early 1938. And I remember

45:49.087 --> 45:55.034
making and then bringing new

45:49.087 --> 45:55.034
black friends of mine. I'd never had any touch with 
racism except as maids in my home up until the trip.

46:00.880 --> 46:05.365
But bringing them to that Hollywood Methodist 
church, just to shock them. That church had not

46:06.166 --> 46:10.351
accepted Democrats, to say nothing of accepting 
minorities. And all the church did was just to say,

46:10.591 --> 46:18.300
you pat me on the back and tell my family not to 
worry. Everybody was shocked and worried.

46:20.886 --> 46:23.269
Everybody was shocked and worried. But they were 
saying, don't worry about Frank. He'll be all

46:25.211 --> 46:26.033
right. And at that point is where the end of this 
thing begins. A Catholic priest in L.A.,

46:34.023 --> 46:48.422
Monsignor Thomas J. O'Dwyer, Archdiocesan 
Director of Charities, heard about me and came out

46:34.023 --> 46:48.422
to my home in Beverly Hills to talk to me. I didn't 
know about what. And I really let it into him,

46:50.763 --> 46:56.890
because I'd seen the role of the Catholic Church in 
Europe, in Spain. It seemed to me like the Catholic
