WEBVTT

00:02.731 --> 00:13.143
Did

00:02.731 --> 00:13.143
he come in, as far as you know, with any kind of a 
blueprint, any kind of goals, a plan of action? No,

00:13.203 --> 00:16.507
I think he did not. He came right out of the College 
of Geosciences, where he had been doing a stellar

00:16.567 --> 00:27.540
job, but he hadn't been there but a year, as I 
recall. He was here when the Senate, I mean, he

00:29.393 --> 00:37.846
worked well with Frank, and I certainly enjoyed 
working with him. And so there was a pretty good

00:39.669 --> 00:52.728
team of like-minded folks who were concerned 
about continuing the forward motion of this

00:39.669 --> 00:52.728
institution. Okay, let's please describe the 
other key folks. Howard Vestal.

01:01.135 --> 01:04.599
Howard went out about the time Mack did. Okay. And 
so Robert Smith. But you worked with Howard for a

01:08.303 --> 01:10.245
while, didn't you? Yes. Oh, that's what I, how was 
he to work with? Oh, wonderful. He was a real

01:16.131 --> 01:17.613
easygoing guy. I liked him. I'm sure you did, too. 
Oh, you bet. Yeah. John Coldis, Vice President for

01:22.398 --> 01:24.800
Students. I had not... a lot to do with John Coldis.

01:36.828 --> 01:52.303
Typically, when there were cases involving 
students, I was sort of, the dean of faculty's

01:36.828 --> 01:52.303
office was the focal point for a student who had a 
complaint about for sexual harassment reasons or

01:54.443 --> 01:56.605
whatever. Well, for sexual harassment reasons. 
And I never got involved with CODIS on something

02:00.309 --> 02:04.413
like that, really. Did you ever have to deal with 
any serious sexual harassment? Yes. Can you

02:09.638 --> 02:15.123
describe the nature of any of them? There were a 
couple of cases where it was male-male.

02:25.207 --> 02:48.989
One, the faculty member had another job perking 
and

02:25.207 --> 02:48.989
went to that other job and I've talked to him since 
and to the best of my knowledge it was one of those

02:25.207 --> 02:48.989
borderline cases and if he transgressed then he 
apparently never did again. There was another

02:49.029 --> 02:53.593
case that was really a sticky wicket where a 
professor again with males, although he was

02:54.923 --> 03:00.931
married and everything else and had been for 
years. But he, it was really a pretty open and shut

03:02.172 --> 03:10.303
case. Did you ever have to deal with a case where a 
faculty member went through the whole hearing

03:10.583 --> 03:19.395
process that might lead to termination? Yes, but 
it didn't lead to termination, but he lost the

03:22.555 --> 03:31.003
case.

03:35.667 --> 03:37.789
The girl didn't press any further. She had already 
left. She was brought back to appear. It was messy.

03:49.345 --> 03:56.355
There were quite a few of them actually, and they 
haven't diminished as I understand it from

03:49.345 --> 03:56.355
talking with Bill Perry. It got increasingly 
difficult. We had a couple of cases, in fact, after

04:01.142 --> 04:12.079
I had stepped down, retired, I was in a federal 
court in Galveston over an age discrimination

04:01.142 --> 04:12.079
case in architecture.

04:14.562 --> 04:16.365
But we won that case. The guy lost his own case by 
what he said before a jury. What would you, let's

04:22.560 --> 04:28.887
make believe somebody said, well, what described 
the task of the dean of faculties? What is the role

04:30.588 --> 04:32.971
of the dean of faculties? People have asked my wife 
that, and she said, well, he runs a complaint

04:32.991 --> 04:40.878
department for the faculty. I'm sort of an, I 
think, and you were too, an ombudsman. Also,

04:47.733 --> 05:02.375
I think we served as linkages between groups that 
needed to get together sometimes for one reason or

04:47.733 --> 05:02.375
another. I

05:02.395 --> 05:09.505
always felt that I was counsel to faculty who 
needed some advice or some way of finding out how to

05:11.729 --> 05:21.864
get advice. This sounds like I'm self-serving, 
but one of the most interesting cases I had, and I

05:22.685 --> 05:36.184
never met this person, was a black individual that 
had been hired in another part of the university.

05:37.548 --> 05:51.562
He came here with his wife and newly adopted child 
and discovered that he could not get insurance for

05:37.548 --> 05:51.562
the adopted child without waiting. It was either 
six months or a year. And somebody said, call

05:55.906 --> 05:57.768
Phillips. You're talking about under the 
university's insurance program? Yes.

06:05.276 --> 06:06.357
Health insurance. And, you know, it's obviously 
common, sound public policy to encourage

06:07.822 --> 06:14.313
adoption. And particularly, you know, in the 
black population, the problem is really quite

06:14.353 --> 06:26.953
serious of finding adoptive parents. Well, I 
couldn't believe it. I couldn't believe it. I

06:30.779 --> 06:31.821
called Ray Smith. And I heard, well, we've always 
done it. What else are you going to hear from him?

06:39.788 --> 06:41.571
But I said, well, this is just intolerable. I said, 
this isn't a faculty member. It's not my

06:44.295 --> 06:46.699
jurisdiction, but I'm so mad about it. I'm going to 
route a letter through you to Frank. And if you feel

06:52.708 --> 06:56.794
the way I do, I'd appreciate it if you'd sign it. 
Otherwise, it's going to him anyway. And I said,

06:59.979 --> 07:02.162
who the hell made this rule? He said, well, it's the 
coordinating board. Yeah. I said, what have we got

07:07.305 --> 07:10.829
to do with it, Ray? And he said, well, I don't know, 
but they did make that rule. He said, they can have

07:17.835 --> 07:20.778
called meetings. And as a matter of fact, he said, I 
think, and he looked at his appointment book,

07:22.599 --> 07:28.725
we're having a meeting next Monday. This is like a 
Thursday. He said, we're having a meeting on

07:30.246 --> 07:32.048
Monday. I'll bring it up at that meeting and maybe 
they'll take some action. And I said, well, okay,

07:39.037 --> 07:44.970
I'll give you to Monday evening. Otherwise, 
you'll see my letter on Tuesday morning for your

07:45.751 --> 07:51.403
signature or not. And he called me Monday 
afternoon and said, they changed the rule. And I

07:59.152 --> 08:04.641
called the guy and told him that it's going to be 
changed, and I never heard anything more about it.

08:05.462 --> 08:08.727
But can you imagine a silly-ass rule like that? I 
never met the man. I don't know who he was. I can't

08:11.411 --> 08:12.413
remember his name. Now, see if you agree with this 
description I sometimes used to use. I used to say

08:17.909 --> 08:25.681
to people that at least part of the role of the dean 
of faculties was to be a spokesman for the faculty

08:17.909 --> 08:25.681
to the administration. That's exactly right. And 
vice versa. And to, in some ways, be one of the

08:29.326 --> 08:40.763
deans, but on other days just be a member of the 
academic community. Do you know where the title

08:42.346 --> 08:44.829
came from? Plural, faculties. No, I don't. I 
always wondered, and sometime after I was at UTEP,

08:51.015 --> 09:01.907
I happened somehow to see an old Clemson College 
catalog. And I looked in there, in the

09:03.970 --> 09:08.995
administration, and there's a man named Jack 
Kenny Williams, whose title was Dean of Faculty.

09:12.727 --> 09:16.318
And it was a title that had been, and he was the first 
one at Clemson. And that was the And the idea, as I

09:19.741 --> 09:33.035
understood it, was that there was a faculty in 
agriculture, a faculty in engineering, a faculty

09:19.741 --> 09:33.035
in arts and sciences, and so that he was the dean to 
represent all of those faculties. And that's why

09:33.796 --> 09:34.977
the plural. Because a few other places I've seen 
somebody who has the title dean of the faculty.

09:42.445 --> 09:44.548
Yeah, and he may be the chief academic officer. 
Right, right. and certainly that would not have

09:45.239 --> 09:47.842
been fitting. There was some association of dean 
of, I never joined it, don't know where. Alright,

09:54.549 --> 10:02.699
surely you must have had some, share with the 
machine some goofy dean of faculty experiences.

10:04.280 --> 10:04.781
Goofy. Goofy, off the wall, I know you're not going 
to believe it type experiences.

10:14.129 --> 10:29.782
Well, I'll have to think about that because I... 
Where some faculty member or dean wanted you to do

10:14.129 --> 10:29.782
something that was completely ridiculous or 
where you were given a report that was incredible?

10:32.665 --> 10:38.730
Well, I do remember one that was unbelievable and 
it occurred in a certain college. An accrediting

10:39.531 --> 10:43.174
committee came on campus

10:46.107 --> 10:58.075
And after a couple of days of talking to everybody, 
they had their final meeting and typically I would

10:46.107 --> 10:58.075
meet with them. So I sat down with them and they 
began by saying we had a remarkable faculty. And I

11:05.767 --> 11:08.732
said, well, that's awfully good to know. I'll be 
pleased to have that. He said, but we're really

11:12.017 --> 11:17.425
reluctant about recommending accreditation. 
And I said, why? You just told me we had a good

11:19.608 --> 11:24.175
faculty, and you said we had a good program, blah, 
blah, blah. Well, we think your faculty's so good

11:25.858 --> 11:31.386
that you're probably going to lose some of them. 
Well, I thought I was listening to, and these were

11:32.345 --> 11:37.813
people that were from second-rate places. That's 
what really pissed me off. And I blew my stack. I

11:44.643 --> 11:50.591
said, of course we're going to be rated, just like 
we rate good schools for high-class people. If we

11:51.693 --> 11:55.118
don't get rated, there's something wrong with us. 
I was just madder than hell. Well, the chief board

11:57.337 --> 12:08.329
rejected their recommendation, but we were 
prepared, the dean and I were prepared to go, you

11:57.337 --> 12:08.329
know, ballistic over this. And that was, talk 
about goofy, I think that was goofy. You mentioned

12:14.276 --> 12:16.098
Phi Beta Kappa a while ago. Was there a formal 
proposal while Vanderbilt was president? Yeah.

12:21.804 --> 12:23.246
There'd been one in my day. Yes.

12:26.868 --> 12:29.932
Somebody torpedoed it as I recall. And one of the 
factors that helped to torpedo it is that two of the

12:29.952 --> 12:54.563
visiting team members were spinster ladies from 
women's colleges in the mid-Atlantic area, and

12:29.952 --> 12:54.563
they gave me the impression that they had gotten 
from somewhere well before they got here, that we

12:29.952 --> 12:54.563
were a good old boy a redneck country bumpkin 
school, and we didn't have a chance. Was there a

13:01.777 --> 13:06.464
visit, was there an on-campus visit from, you 
know, during the Vandiver days? Well, if there

13:08.286 --> 13:20.044
was, I don't remember, remember meeting with it, 
so I guess it never did come to pass, but we did, we

13:08.286 --> 13:20.044
did try, and a chap that headed it up, Frank 
personally asked him to do it, was a former head of

13:21.425 --> 13:28.374
the economics department who came from Tulane. 
And I can't remember his name, but. Because to me

13:33.300 --> 13:35.763
that's a very appropriate goal. Yes. Because if 
Baylor, SMU, TCU, Trinity, Rice, UT, A&M ought to

13:37.526 --> 13:47.799
be competitive. I agree. With that. I agree. Let's 
see, so we have Eaton and

13:51.614 --> 14:00.823
Mobley, I mean Eaton and Bill Mews. Who follows 
when Mews leaves to go? He was in the Chancellor's

14:05.268 --> 14:12.294
office from the business school, the Deputy 
Chancellor. After Vandiver, who is the

14:12.755 --> 14:14.737
president? Mobley? Mobley. Is that still in your 
day? Yes, yes. All right. How did you learn that

14:23.186 --> 14:27.852
Vandiver was not going to be president anymore?

14:32.118 --> 14:35.643
I think he told me that he said, I'm going to quit 
while I'm ahead. Okay. All right. And then was

14:38.207 --> 14:46.319
there an interim or did Mobley come? Mobley 
followed him. Yeah. Describe Mobley's

14:51.929 --> 14:54.876
management leadership style. Well, he was not the 
kind that walked the floor of the faculty, of the

14:56.300 --> 15:04.720
factory, as Vannevar was.

15:07.535 --> 15:35.567
he moved and I thought this was a mistake he moved 
and took the vice president for finance with him

15:07.535 --> 15:35.567
but not the provost that was symbolically bad and 
he moved over to the tower like I as an outsider

15:07.535 --> 15:35.567
thought oh this is isolating the president from 
the kind of camp easy accessibility Yeah, I did

15:36.560 --> 15:37.682
too. I thought it was a major mistake. He was a 
disappointment to me. I thought that apparently

15:44.252 --> 16:02.820
he had done a pretty good job as a dean, but

15:44.252 --> 16:02.820
apparently

15:44.252 --> 16:02.820
he just Right. Was he the president when you 
retired? Yes. Okay. So those ten years, what were

16:08.081 --> 16:13.207
some of the high points for you?

16:16.270 --> 16:17.131
Victories, joys? The book that you have will sort 
of emphasize some of the things. Working to to

16:28.687 --> 16:47.826
assisting in the creation of the senate I think 
certainly was one the expansion of the

16:28.687 --> 16:47.826
development faculty development program which 
and I didn't tell you this but after we got money out

16:28.687 --> 16:47.826
of the former students then we took the case of the 
department head dean who is stepping down and

16:48.532 --> 17:13.290
needs also needs to get and we've been using the 
development study program for those people but we

16:48.532 --> 17:13.290
went to the development office and said this would 
be an appropriate thing for you all to fund so they

16:48.532 --> 17:13.290
came up with a bunch of money for that which I felt 
was a good For a while there, our effort to attract

17:13.709 --> 17:26.303
blacks was somewhat effective as long as we were 
paying the full salary, not only blacks but

17:13.709 --> 17:26.303
minorities.

17:30.107 --> 17:33.411
I got some pleasure out of that. The revision of the 
academic freedom and responsibility tenure

17:34.812 --> 17:43.041
policy, that was a massive effort. involving, I 
worked closely with then legal office person

17:43.831 --> 18:01.830
Colleen Batchelor, Bill Batchelor's wife, who 
has worked for, what's his name, who was the

17:43.831 --> 18:01.830
attorney, chief attorney? Jimmy Bond. Jimmy 
Bond, who's now with the firm that, well, anyway,

18:03.312 --> 18:12.522
with a local firm.

18:14.577 --> 18:24.186
That took, oh, a year or two to get the policy 
redone, then the procedures relating thereto. I

18:25.307 --> 18:41.821
remember one of the deans saying, who had been a 
vice president at University of Houston, saying,

18:25.307 --> 18:41.821
if only we had had that at Houston, life would have 
been a lot simpler. But Vandiver didn't like it. He

18:45.577 --> 18:50.685
thought it was too

18:45.577 --> 18:50.685
detailed. And I didn't like it, too. This is one of 
the interesting, in some respects, I didn't. One

18:56.093 --> 19:10.015
of the things that happens, it seems to me, when 
you're trying to write problems, trying to make

18:56.093 --> 19:10.015
procedures clear, you end up inadvertently or 
inadvertently bureaucratizing things to a

19:11.969 --> 19:22.980
sometimes ridiculous point. So Vandiver had 
something of a point there. We were dealing with

19:25.984 --> 19:40.879
all kinds of conceivable possibilities, and we 
end up with a document that doesn't leave you much

19:25.984 --> 19:40.879
wiggle room, to use a term that Gordon Eaton used to 
use a lot.

19:47.391 --> 19:55.400
But anyway, all in all, I think it did help the 
faculty and that's what it was all about. I

19:56.481 --> 20:01.306
mentioned earlier, I found it interesting that so 
many people came out of agriculture. It was

20:01.907 --> 20:09.955
agriculture, for example, that first presented 
or asked for from the Senate a procedure whereby it

20:12.044 --> 20:16.572
was laid out how to hire a department head, no more 
of this business of O.D. Butler deciding who was

20:16.612 --> 20:19.417
going to be. And then it went on for department head 
review and department and dean hiring and review.

20:29.214 --> 20:32.579
So we developed a fairly elaborate procedure 
there too. Other highlights and victories?

20:38.605 --> 20:42.890
You know, we're making a tally now of the things 
that you're saying, yeah, I'm glad we did it. We're

20:42.930 --> 20:44.031
able to get those done.

20:47.054 --> 20:58.386
On a personal level, I really enjoyed the job on the 
standpoint of being able to study the various

20:47.054 --> 20:58.386
cultures of the colleges. Fascinating to look at 
these different tribes and see what their rituals

20:59.607 --> 21:05.794
are and all of that. and in the process meet an awful 
lot of fine folks. A few pickles, but an awful lot of

21:11.598 --> 21:15.181
lovely people. And I found that to be a good 
experience. I'm not going to ask the negative now.

21:22.889 --> 21:28.555
In your day, which of the programs do you think were 
most nationally competitive? Of the various

21:30.017 --> 21:32.039
colleges or departments? Colleges.

21:39.625 --> 21:44.291
Geosciences has always been a class act.

21:46.553 --> 21:50.979
Per capita, per faculty, they raise money like 
there's no tomorrow. I always wanted the College

21:52.461 --> 22:01.752
of Science to sit in it, because every time they'll 
hire a chemist, I don't care how much money they

21:52.461 --> 22:01.752
bring in,

22:03.757 --> 22:09.624
the cost of labs and all the rest of it that goes with 
it eats you up. I'm told that

22:10.504 --> 22:20.295
Rutter picked two departments to be leading 
edges. It might have been better if he'd picked

22:20.375 --> 22:24.540
something other than chemistry. Economists are 
high priced, but you only need an economist. You

22:30.527 --> 22:33.510
don't need a bloody lab with them.

22:36.207 --> 22:38.092
Science certainly is strong. If you look at where 
the distinguished professors are, they're

22:38.112 --> 22:45.891
concentrated in the College of Science.

22:49.681 --> 22:53.490
I think education has really done rather well for 
itself. Liberal arts certainly, I was upset when

22:54.770 --> 23:04.461
liberal arts slipped from second place to third 
when business overtook. Business had been number

23:04.541 --> 23:09.727
two, then slipped to three, and then reclaimed 
two. But I think

23:10.408 --> 23:23.022
a university, to

23:10.408 --> 23:23.022
be a really good university, has to have an 
enormously strong liberal arts college. And so,

23:24.638 --> 23:31.567
that has certainly improved too, I have to say, 
enormously.

23:37.695 --> 23:40.939
See, I really come out of liberal arts and 
economics. I have a very bizarre history. I would

23:46.186 --> 23:52.755
love to have been in the room when Earl Rudder gave 
Mel Greenhut a long lecture about not bringing any

23:54.068 --> 24:00.782
liberal economists here, because I don't think 
Mel Greenhut would have needed that lecture. No,

24:00.943 --> 24:02.426
he didn't need the lecture. But he got it anyway 
because Rutter didn't know, apparently, that he

24:02.446 --> 24:08.379
was conservative by nature. Any great 
frustrations of things that you wish we could have

24:14.504 --> 24:17.027
done during that ten years? I wish we could have 
done more with minority hiring, but given the

24:18.469 --> 24:34.188
community, the cards were stacked against us to 
some extent, and with student recruitment, too.

24:34.208 --> 24:38.634
Now, there was no, on the campus, there were no 
roadblocks, were there? No. No, I think the

24:40.236 --> 24:42.739
community was more of the problem. Vannevar 
really tried in that area, there's no question

24:43.563 --> 24:47.187
about that. Coldest wasn't much help, by the way.

24:53.874 --> 25:01.743
I think that... Let's see, and the Honors Program 
was really going well during those years under

24:53.874 --> 25:01.743
Dale Noble, wasn't it? Yes. Barry Shapiro got it 
started, and Dale Noble did a fine job. Dale's now

25:07.890 --> 25:10.653
the president up at, I believe, Denison? Denison, 
uh-huh. One of the things I enjoyed doing was being

25:15.473 --> 25:21.884
sort of a mentor to Larry. God, I tell you, when you 
get older, your names fade away. Anyway, he went up

25:29.316 --> 25:40.975
to be a dean in

25:29.316 --> 25:40.975
Arkansas, and now is the vice president in a school 
in Oregon and I kind of mentored him. He had been in

25:46.058 --> 25:54.568
charge of the honors program for a couple years and 
then he left. But while he was, he didn't have all

25:55.409 --> 26:09.966
that much to do and so he worked with me on the 
program like the academic freedom

25:55.409 --> 26:09.966
responsibility and tenure. Can you think of any 
opportunities that in hindsight we didn't take?

26:20.877 --> 26:28.426
Well, I can think, see mistakes we made in hiring 
deans, and I chaired them. We could have

26:29.027 --> 26:39.160
progressed better if we'd found somebody who 
turned out to be more effective, but you know,

26:39.815 --> 26:49.972
There's always a strong tendency for the faculty 
to want somebody from off the campus, figuring

26:39.815 --> 26:49.972
they can drive a better bargain and get more 
goodies for them. And so you end up buying

26:50.773 --> 26:53.738
sometimes an unknown quantity. Let me add to that. 
I've always said too that search committees tend

26:55.602 --> 27:04.236
to over concentrate on the apparent strengths of 
the outsider. never thinking about how much the

27:04.958 --> 27:09.223
outsider has to learn about the local situation. 
And they then overemphasize the apparent

27:10.004 --> 27:15.770
shortcomings of the local person. Because his 
warts are all there to be seen. That's right. Not

27:20.595 --> 27:25.721
realizing that they know all of those 
shortcomings and what their limits are. And that

27:27.123 --> 27:33.750
the newcomer, if he or she has no experience in that 
region, may spend the first year just settling in.

27:39.809 --> 27:56.444
Whereas I've always thought, and I got this idea 
from Earl Rudder, that one of the tasks of every

27:39.809 --> 27:56.444
administrator ought to be to have an adjutant who 
might have the capability to move right on in and

27:39.809 --> 27:56.444
keep the ball rolling. Can you think of some 
examples of where there was a notable lack of

28:03.245 --> 28:07.771
continuity going from one administrator to the 
next?

28:14.139 --> 28:27.617
Well, talking about presidents, I think there was 
a lack of continuity certainly between Sampson

28:14.139 --> 28:27.617
and Vandiver, but it didn't make any difference in 
that case. All right. And of course... Then from

28:28.378 --> 28:32.323
Vandiver to Mobley? Although Vandiver stayed 
around, but I don't think Mobley ever asked his

28:33.367 --> 28:40.014
opinion on anything. I don't think there's been 
any continuity since Williams ceased being

28:40.034 --> 28:49.903
president. That's probably true. There was none 
between Williams and Jarvis. I've learned in

28:56.069 --> 29:01.855
interviewing Mrs. Williams that Rudder and 
Williams were on the phone and did exchange some

29:02.020 --> 29:04.665
letters. And the Rutter plan was Williams was 
going to come and in today's lingo be the executive

29:05.386 --> 29:12.839
vice president for the institution. And Rutter 
was going to run the system. His title would still

29:17.087 --> 29:18.730
be president.

29:22.156 --> 29:26.644
But Williams, then when Mr. Rutter got sick and 
none of this was put into writing. that it all was

29:27.164 --> 29:29.627
lost. So there was some communication between the 
two of them, but since then it seems to me there's

29:31.309 --> 29:41.942
been a lot of break. I don't think there was any 
problem when Gordon Eaton came in as vice

29:41.962 --> 29:47.749
president, academic vice president. No. That was 
a seamless transition.

29:54.890 --> 29:56.371
Of course, I was already there. That helped, I 
suppose, a little bit. But he had hit it off well

29:58.833 --> 30:02.537
with Frank from the beginning. You say he did? He 
did, yes. Now, I'm not aware of whether there was

30:05.479 --> 30:13.346
any conversation of meaningful nature between 
Calhoun and Prescott. I don't think there was, but

30:14.027 --> 30:16.529
I'm not aware. I'm not aware of it either. We both 
were there, and I don't guess I There is a tendency

30:25.197 --> 30:35.286
sometimes to

30:25.197 --> 30:35.286
ignore your predecessor. The only time I ever 
asked, when I was acting dean, asked John Pearson

30:37.188 --> 30:53.483
something I wanted to know where some money had 
gone, and I found out that he had transferred it to

30:37.188 --> 30:53.483
the management department.

30:56.348 --> 30:58.551
and that happened to be the department he went back 
to. Let's see, system administration. Did you

31:03.840 --> 31:08.827
ever deal with the system as dean of faculties? 
Yes, this is something I had almost forgotten

31:11.291 --> 31:24.752
about, but when Hubert was chancellor, he 
instigated a program whereby we exchanged

31:11.291 --> 31:24.752
faculty with preview and I was designated the 
person to go down and negotiate that. Jerry Gaston

31:38.492 --> 31:53.254
was then head of sociology and a whole van load of us 
went down and the then president whose name I have

31:38.492 --> 31:53.254
forgotten let us cool our heels for an hour.
