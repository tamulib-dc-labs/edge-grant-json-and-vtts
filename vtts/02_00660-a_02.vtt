WEBVTT

00:03.355 --> 00:13.387
And that was a decision which I didn't have to, you 
might say, go into a separate discussion with

00:03.355 --> 00:13.387
myself, because I had been involved in it, on the 
thing. It was perfectly clear to me that the

00:13.567 --> 00:32.569
development of a graduate education program here 
at Woods Hole Oceanographic, particularly in

00:13.567 --> 00:32.569
connection with MIT, the way we had this getting 
that started, that that was an extraordinarily

00:13.567 --> 00:32.569
worthwhile thing to do for the, should we say, for 
the welfare of the world. No decision. In other

00:33.813 --> 00:36.817
words, you don't make decisions at that point. The 
pattern is perfectly clear. And when you begin to

00:39.961 --> 00:45.369
make contact with MIT, what was MIT's reaction? 
You've been cooperating with MIT for a series of

00:45.589 --> 00:51.777
years now in terms of teaching.

00:55.022 --> 01:01.070
The responsibility, in a sense, for making those 
contacts was not really mine. It had already been

01:01.471 --> 01:02.472
done. The major person up there for getting things 
started, of course, was Frank Press, as you know,

01:03.650 --> 01:13.821
is now the science advisor to the president. But I 
had also worked

01:14.782 --> 01:29.337
on the ICO days, had worked a little with Jerry 
Wiesner, who was the president, the boss of, I'd

01:14.782 --> 01:29.337
also worked briefly with Stratton. So I knew MIT 
well enough to know that they're one of the few

01:29.806 --> 01:42.702
universities in which, if you had an objective 
that was worthwhile, that MIT could somehow or

01:29.806 --> 01:42.702
other find a way to do it. And I must say, that's a 
rather unique university in that sense.

01:52.434 --> 01:57.720
Was your first assignment dean then to begin to 
draw departments here at Woods Hole?

02:00.653 --> 02:01.134
K.O. Emery had already done that, too. And this, 
really, the technical aspects of moving in as dean

02:03.377 --> 02:15.978
were extraordinarily simple, because so much 
state work had been done already. The main

02:17.059 --> 02:22.528
objective was to, you might say, define the 
objective as the program. And the objectives of

02:23.830 --> 02:27.977
the program really were that we would regard Woods 
Hole as a community of scientists. And the only

02:32.574 --> 02:41.786
difference between graduate students and, 
quote, members of the faculty is that they're

02:32.574 --> 02:41.786
beginning scientists, so to speak. So that we 
tried to set it up, and had fair success at it, at

02:43.088 --> 02:56.226
avoiding the rather detailed and complicated 
curriculum that is so common in most graduate

02:43.088 --> 02:56.226
schools. In other words, part of my objective was 
to hold down the organization, you might say, and

02:56.813 --> 03:07.888
to maintain the concept of its being a place for a 
young scientist to learn science. Now, as an

03:08.829 --> 03:16.880
outsider,

03:08.829 --> 03:16.880
Woods Hole had not really ever been known much as a 
teaching institution. It was primarily a

03:16.900 --> 03:18.822
research institution. Why do you suppose Woods 
Hole began to move into graduate studies? No,

03:23.869 --> 03:25.792
that's not true. They... Over the years, we've got 
the figures there. There have been a large number

03:30.720 --> 03:36.867
of people doing their doctorate work here at Woods 
Hole. But it would be done, someone from Chicago or

03:37.809 --> 03:48.822
from Yale or Harvard or wherever would be coming 
down, and we would make provisions for them, and

03:37.809 --> 03:48.822
they could work with one of our staff people. So 
that in essence, we had been in the business all

03:49.502 --> 03:52.426
along. We hadn't been in the formal business of 
being able to tell a youngster, come down to Woods

03:54.847 --> 04:07.404
Hole and become a part of the scientific community 
and select the particular area you want to work in,

03:54.847 --> 04:07.404
and we'll make sure you can get a degree at the end. 
Before that, that decision had been made by other

04:08.545 --> 04:13.552
universities, you see. So it was simply a matter of 
a shift that we could, in effect, admit the

04:14.894 --> 04:23.065
students and select the students. Rather than 
someone deciding with whom he would like to work

04:24.547 --> 04:33.094
and making overtures and this sort

04:24.547 --> 04:33.094
of thing. When time comes for student 
recruitment, how do you go about it? Send out the

04:37.698 --> 04:44.564
usual brochures, and the recruitment progress 
has been very good. I've forgotten what it is,

04:45.424 --> 04:54.452
about 10 times larger than the ones we can admit.

04:55.242 --> 04:59.285
We set an upper limit, which we've now reached. And 
that is that the total number of students

04:59.325 --> 05:04.410
registered in one time should not exceed 80. And 
we're sticking very closely to that. And I might

05:08.874 --> 05:15.819
say we reached that level within two years, I 
remember.

05:16.040 --> 05:17.221
That's being highly selective. That's being 
highly selective. Let's say about a 10 to 1 ratio.

05:26.461 --> 05:39.861
Now, I know that your role as an administrator with 
fellow scientists

05:26.461 --> 05:39.861
would probably limit the amount of direction you 
could give, since it's sort of a community of

05:26.461 --> 05:39.861
equals. But did you have any series of goals as an 
administrator that you should like to carry out

05:40.282 --> 05:45.930
down here? No, except to... Let me put it this way, 
that assuming the general goal, of creating the

05:55.874 --> 06:02.180
atmosphere for young scientists to learn science 
and the thing. And with sort of the subset on that,

06:02.961 --> 06:15.794
that you try to avoid the excessive organization 
so that all students take X, Y, Z courses. And they

06:16.494 --> 06:18.736
have to do it in a certain time and so on. And try to 
model the thing so that it fits best both their

06:19.177 --> 06:24.362
backgrounds and their current interests. they 
come in from widely different backgrounds.

06:28.422 --> 06:32.005
Biologists, physicists, chemists, 
mathematicians, etc., etc.

06:35.608 --> 06:51.362
So that the formalities of the thing, we again 
could do very easily because each of the

06:35.608 --> 06:51.362
departments here could set up its own sort of 
committee on the thing and could set up, they'd

06:35.608 --> 06:51.362
operate on an admissions committee. We had to have 
established joint committees with MIT, which

06:54.110 --> 07:05.380
again turned out to be very easy because MIT has as 
many rules as regulations as the ordinary

06:54.110 --> 07:05.380
university does. But they also have a most 
remarkable knack of being able to work within

07:05.460 --> 07:10.605
those rules. So essentially, I would say that the 
graduate school developed

07:12.186 --> 07:23.256
as a community of scholars. basis, and that it 
wouldn't have been possible with any other

07:23.506 --> 07:31.616
combination that I know of, except possibly the 
University of Chicago. We could have done it

07:31.796 --> 07:32.658
there. Chicago also has that extraordinary 
flexibility, which I might say, having been at

07:32.698 --> 07:52.062
state universities for quite some time, too, it 
would be much more difficult than a state

07:32.698 --> 07:52.062
university, simply because of the 
organizational sort of rigidity sometimes that

07:32.698 --> 07:52.062
you encounter. No, I had a relatively few 
problems. One, there were a terrible number of

07:58.419 --> 08:13.136
small details, and if you want to know why I could 
succeed in that, because I know they'd have taken

07:58.419 --> 08:13.136
care of the administrative details and the like, 
it was because of Jake Pearson. They finally got

08:13.977 --> 08:17.121
him up to the position of assistant dean. Before 
that, he was always assistant to the dean. But Jake

08:23.635 --> 08:26.839
Pearson was remarkable. Let me put it this way. I 
came into a situation in which we already had the

08:29.263 --> 08:36.795
enthusiastic support of the important people. By 
important, I mean scientifically important at

08:37.255 --> 08:41.221
MIT. We already had enough people at Woods Hole 
Oceanographic who would be interested in having

08:45.839 --> 08:48.423
some graduate students around. And we already had 
K.O. Emery, who had done quite a bit of six months to

08:52.129 --> 08:58.799
a year, something like that. He'd begun to 
formulate the way some of the seminars and courses

08:58.839 --> 09:06.672
might be run on the thing. And we had this 
remarkable man, Jake Pearson, could not only

09:12.350 --> 09:25.168
grasp the concepts and assist in developing the 
concepts, but he could recognize that if you had a

09:12.350 --> 09:25.168
student at a given point, he had to somehow or other 
register properly with MIT. He had to do it here,

09:25.488 --> 09:26.670
too. He had to make sure that the tuition was taken 
care of, all those details, so that I had none of

09:27.551 --> 09:36.163
those problems. except to make occasional 
decisions if there was a little bit of

09:38.050 --> 09:44.958
misunderstanding, things like that. 
Extraordinarily simple job.

09:50.684 --> 09:57.872
Was there any difficulty in encouraging research 
scientists, fundamentally research

09:50.684 --> 09:57.872
scientists, to accept teaching duties? Oh, yes. 
That would follow. Difficulty in the sense that

10:04.119 --> 10:06.201
if... If we had tried to stipulate to 
oceanographer X that you take on a course, we would

10:08.240 --> 10:20.377
have been a hell of a mess. But we had enough people 
who would do it and say, well, yes, I'll try it for a

10:20.397 --> 10:27.627
year. And then once they realized the joy of having 
some good graduate students paying attention to

10:28.629 --> 10:36.660
them, then they began to offer to do it. But I'm sure 
that if we'd tried to follow more of a government

10:38.108 --> 10:57.358
laboratory type of operation where we would have 
taken and outlined all the staff members and said,

10:38.108 --> 10:57.358
well, now these guys will teach this course, and 
these guys will teach this course, and these guys

10:38.108 --> 10:57.358
will teach this course, I think it would have been a 
fiasco. But it was within a couple of years. The

11:02.594 --> 11:09.583
ones who had, some of the people who had originally 
said, the hell with it, don't ask me to do a thing

11:02.594 --> 11:09.583
with that. They're on the point where they were at 
least taking in students and would say finally,

11:09.603 --> 11:16.311
well, these students want me to give a seminar on 
this. And so I'd give a seminar. Well, what's the

11:19.435 --> 11:22.158
difference between a good seminar and a course? 
Seminar's better. No, it was extraordinarily

11:27.144 --> 11:30.188
easy here. So the transition then was quite 
smooth? Yes. Did the institution grow in terms of

11:37.034 --> 11:42.904
staff with any rapidity once you began to bring in 
students? No, I think you'll find from the

11:42.924 --> 11:51.759
statistics that it's been pretty much level as far 
as that's concerned. There's been a various

11:53.622 --> 11:56.547
number quite a percentage. I can't give you a 
percentage because I've been away for four years.

12:02.736 --> 12:10.490
A fair percentage of our best people now are very 
happy to associate with graduate students. And

12:10.510 --> 12:13.475
many of them will also contribute very directly to 
teaching.

12:16.400 --> 12:22.230
Were there any accomplishments which you'd like 
to single out as dean that you were particularly

12:16.400 --> 12:22.230
proud of?

12:27.492 --> 12:29.435
No, that would be a little hard to define. The 
accomplishments

12:29.475 --> 12:45.877
are, of course, ones which depended not so much 
upon my operations as a dean as upon the

12:29.475 --> 12:45.877
fulfillment of the objectives that had already 
been expressed. In other words, the number of

12:46.317 --> 12:55.930
applicants rose rapidly the first couple of 
years, reached a level that we could bring in the

12:56.112 --> 13:03.142
the students so that we would head for this top 
level of 80 students maximum on the thing. And

13:03.162 --> 13:09.250
we're giving, I think that amounts to 15 or so 
degrees a year. And I would say the existence of the

13:10.512 --> 13:19.604
graduate school on an operating level is the chief 
of the objectives. As far as I'm concerned, that's

13:19.704 --> 13:21.867
the accomplishment.

13:24.243 --> 13:49.710
And I'm not being unduly modest when I say that my 
role in it was primarily that of just defining a few

13:24.243 --> 13:49.710
of the general ways in which it would operate, and 
then relying upon the fact that you had a bunch of

13:24.243 --> 13:49.710
damn bright, able people who would, if you had good 
graduate students, would recognize the real

13:24.243 --> 13:49.710
virtue of having young scientists learn their 
science. And if you're interested in the history

13:51.327 --> 14:06.482
of science, I think you'll find a beginning 
recognition that the advancement of knowledge

13:51.327 --> 14:06.482
really depends in large part upon two roles of 
graduate students. One is the work that they do,

14:06.862 --> 14:11.467
and the other is the role they have in changing 
their professor. Essays on that are beginning to

14:13.088 --> 14:19.174
appear in public, I might say.

14:22.293 --> 14:33.083
That's one of the things that, well, there's a, 
let's go back, there's a little bit of history on

14:22.293 --> 14:33.083
this that had to do with it. I'd also been very 
closely associated with Detlef Barak, who was

14:33.103 --> 14:49.339
the, who ended up being the president of 
Rockefeller Institute and was responsible for

14:33.103 --> 14:49.339
changing it to Rockefeller University. And his 
reasons for doing that and I'd had many long

14:52.465 --> 15:08.603
discussions with him on that, was that many of the 
scientists in Rockefeller University were

14:52.465 --> 15:08.603
finding life rather dull, and it was showing up a 
little in the work that they were doing. And so that

15:09.625 --> 15:21.358
and I agreed, and I wasn't so advised to him on 
anything like that, that this concept that if you

15:09.625 --> 15:21.358
had young scientists develop, for the future, 
there are two real positive contributions. One

15:26.999 --> 15:31.807
was the work they did, and the other was the 
stimulating effect that they have upon the people

15:26.999 --> 15:31.807
they're working with. So that was in large part the 
definition that Ted Bronk had in creating the

15:33.549 --> 15:41.321
university out of the Rockefeller Institute. And 
I had that background. And in a sense, you'll see

15:47.765 --> 15:52.953
there's quite a bit of similarity between the two 
places. Woods Hole Oceanographic, which was

15:52.973 --> 16:01.627
primarily a research institution, and 
Rockefeller Institute, which had been primarily

15:52.973 --> 16:01.627
a research institution. And the same concepts 
that led to make that into the university also

16:02.829 --> 16:09.679
applied to the Woods Hole Oceanographic. So I had 
more of an educational background in this whole

16:10.581 --> 16:15.949
thing. And we also agreed thoroughly upon this 
concept that the community scholar's idea is the

16:17.110 --> 16:26.999
proper way to run a graduate school. To hell with 
red tape. If you have a bright student, somehow or

16:31.062 --> 16:34.125
other you make sure he can get his degree. Get him 
out. Get him out for the benefit of the public.

16:42.352 --> 16:45.295
Now, when time comes to replace yourself as dean. 
Do you go through another search committee? Do you

16:49.417 --> 16:51.239
try to bring somebody in again from outside? Well, 
in this particular case, we're

16:53.222 --> 17:00.150
a very favorable position. We had Bob Morris 
already here. The answer is no, we didn't have to.

17:05.576 --> 17:16.429
Because if you have someone who's been a notable 
scientist, been a dean at a university, and had

17:05.576 --> 17:16.429
been himself assistant secretary of the Navy, and 
then had been president of the university. And

17:20.560 --> 17:22.062
here he was sitting there. You don't need to go on a 
search committee.

17:26.949 --> 17:29.092
He got the outstanding candidate sitting right 
there. Other than that, well, sure, there was the

17:30.794 --> 17:35.221
formality of a search committee. Now, had he been 
here, though, when you had first come here, is it?

17:41.610 --> 17:42.090
No. I didn't think so. No, he came in. He's been here 
about two years, I think. And,

17:47.965 --> 17:55.873
of course, he followed the work very closely and 
we're on good terms. Now,

17:55.933 --> 18:05.183
the next series of questions I have are sort of 
personal questions that don't feel off balance.

18:05.604 --> 18:10.990
If you had to list in your scientific career what 
you considered your major accomplishment, what

18:05.604 --> 18:10.990
would you list? That would be a toughie. The major 
accomplishment, scientifically, really, is

18:16.400 --> 18:26.211
something which has now outgrown me, should we 
say, and that is the development of the whole

18:16.400 --> 18:26.211
concept of ion movement. Because at the time when I 
was a graduate student, ions didn't move back and

18:28.073 --> 18:34.961
forth across cell membranes except in certain, 
like potassium. But the active movement of

18:36.343 --> 18:43.251
sodium, things like that, the development of the 
concept of the ability of cell membranes to move

18:36.343 --> 18:43.251
things back and forth, I was very much part of it at 
that time. Now then, I also made a decision, as I

18:49.633 --> 19:01.148
say, at about age 55, that that whole field was 
going very well indeed. There were some very good

19:02.029 --> 19:04.593
youngsters coming along. They were going to 
develop it. And meanwhile, things had been

19:07.196 --> 19:12.563
happening. Following the war, as you know, there 
was this development of the concept that there

19:13.606 --> 19:22.514
should be a federal support of science. And I had 
also, something I forgot to mention earlier, I had

19:23.214 --> 19:33.003
also been mixed up early in the development of the 
Office of Naval Research Operation. I was on, I

19:33.964 --> 19:40.409
think, their first advisory committee in biology 
on that. So that when the legislation relating to

19:43.053 --> 19:47.920
the Science Foundation began to get worked up. I 
got involved in that, too, because I felt it had to

19:47.981 --> 20:00.380
be done and should involve some of the conceptual 
attitudes that the ONR had as well on the thing. And

20:01.822 --> 20:08.592
I got actively involved in some of the legislative 
proceedings for a very odd sort of reason. The

20:09.413 --> 20:11.136
first bill that was written head for the National 
Science Foundation, a division of medical

20:11.673 --> 20:16.720
sciences with a subdivision of biology. And being 
a biologist, of course, that threw me into a big

20:17.942 --> 20:22.669
flat. I had to make certain that any legislation 
that went through would recognize that medicine

20:22.689 --> 20:33.124
was really an applied branch of biology.

20:34.150 --> 20:42.060
As one devoted to Pressful, I couldn't stand 
seeing this legislation which served the

20:34.150 --> 20:42.060
Division of Medical Sciences and Subdivision of 
Biology. Very odd. Which gave rise to some

20:45.625 --> 20:50.711
extraordinarily interesting discussions with 
the deans of medical schools. I bet it did.

20:55.597 --> 20:57.139
I need to ask you some questions about ONR. I didn't 
realize you were there when it was first

20:57.199 --> 20:59.382
organized. How did the concept of ONR sort of 
emerge in terms of supportive science? This is

21:05.242 --> 21:10.670
something which I have tried to get someone to give 
me the complete history, and I can't. I can't

21:10.730 --> 21:13.794
answer that. There's something about the 
structure of the Navy that allowed them to, once

21:14.735 --> 21:29.014
they established something, and I don't know who 
did this, and you put it under an admiral, and you

21:30.580 --> 21:41.630
have a good captain in charge of it, and then he in 
turn can go out and get a good civilian to operate

21:30.580 --> 21:41.630
it, you can go ahead and be as innovative as you want 
to. And who put in the original ideas, I don't know.

21:44.892 --> 21:46.214
And I wish you would find out. I don't have any idea. 
I know Revelle was there, but I don't know where the

21:48.496 --> 21:51.959
idea of ONR came from. I don't either. And...

22:02.677 --> 22:11.654
If I were you, if you ever get into Washington,

22:02.677 --> 22:11.654
look up a man named Chuck Schilling.

22:14.779 --> 22:21.191
I think it's S-C-H. And Chuck Schilling, Bob Abel 
knows him well. And Bob might know something about

22:22.213 --> 22:23.856
it. But I really put that something to look into in 
the future if you really want to follow the

22:26.133 --> 22:32.881
development of federal support of science. Chuck 
Schilling was the captain in charge when I got

22:35.024 --> 22:41.672
involved with LNR. It had been going for, I've 
forgotten, several years. There's a moment I

22:47.800 --> 22:49.582
can't remember the date. It was

22:50.724 --> 22:55.009
the late 40s. I became involved. How did you get 
involved in UNR?

23:12.825 --> 23:13.866
I'm not quite sure. Most

23:13.886 --> 23:23.916
of these questions you're asking about 
involvement, I'm sure you know that the No matter

23:25.516 --> 23:32.728
how much organization you have, things are still 
personal associations on that. And I have a

23:34.571 --> 23:38.657
feeling it was because...

23:44.006 --> 23:49.735
I can't give names, but there were a couple of the 
Navy people in the old days of... some of the

23:50.542 --> 24:03.037
congressional committees on the formation of the 
National Science Foundation, who became

23:50.542 --> 24:03.037
involved also with ONR and the personal 
association with them on that.

24:10.966 --> 24:11.647
That's the answer. Well, I think that's the way the 
world operates. Oh, yes. The world still operates

24:16.192 --> 24:18.895
on the Cousin Principle, really. But 
fortunately, it's not entirely that. In other

24:21.883 --> 24:25.348
words, it's possible to get into the circuit. But

24:26.329 --> 24:33.198
difficult sometimes. Yeah. Difficult if you have 
to go through formal application procedures.

24:42.330 --> 24:43.752
It's getting easier, of course.

24:46.634 --> 24:52.761
I'm very pleased that it's possible for him to get a 
little outside of the Cousin principle.

24:55.443 --> 24:59.988
Were there any particular accomplishments in, 
may I use the word, bureaucratic service? I really

25:00.028 --> 25:01.089
don't mean that at all. I mean in terms of committee 
advisory service, of which you're particularly

25:01.250 --> 25:09.238
proud.

25:09.258 --> 25:15.865
Well, the Office of Naval Research had already 
devised a system of having an advisory group. And

25:17.161 --> 25:33.607
so at the time that I was in the National Science 
Foundation, a very nice character named Alan was

25:17.161 --> 25:33.607
beginning to develop the National Institutes of 
Health system on the thing. And we worked up a more

25:35.129 --> 25:41.599
extended philosophy of peer review committees. 
And that I was proud of for a while, and now I'm

25:42.743 --> 25:53.573
disappointed in it, because the peer review 
committees are more and more getting the idea that

25:42.743 --> 25:53.573
they run the programs. And the original concept we 
had, both in the ONR and when I was working with

25:54.594 --> 26:05.945
Allen and the NIH, was that the peer review groups 
would be advisory. And the program manager was the

26:06.926 --> 26:11.130
one who really had to make the decisions. on the 
basis of the recommendations of the peer review

26:11.380 --> 26:15.788
system. And the reasoning there is very simple, 
and that is that if the program goes bad, all you

26:15.808 --> 26:23.902
have to do is fire the program director. Whereas if 
he is in a position where you can say that all he's

26:24.964 --> 26:36.223
doing is following the rules of the peer review 
group, then how do you fire him, you know? And you

26:36.912 --> 26:39.255
can't fire the peer review committee. So I'm 
distressed at the fact that the peer review system

26:39.275 --> 26:52.655
has become so institutionalized and formalized 
that they now act as though they are the ones who run

26:39.275 --> 26:52.655
programs. I love the concept of having someone 
responsible for a program, not necessarily so you

26:52.956 --> 27:05.434
can fire him, but so that you know who's really 
responsible for doing it.

27:08.806 --> 27:10.448
Is there anything you'd like to add to the tape?

27:13.752 --> 27:21.923
No, except to give you the warm approval of what 
you're trying to do. And if you're interested in

27:21.943 --> 27:37.362
the history of how oceanography is developed, I 
hope you are dragging up the concept that

27:21.943 --> 27:37.362
oceanography really developed, not from not 
people who were trained as oceanographers, but

27:37.932 --> 27:42.401
people who were devoted to study the oceans. And, 
of course, here at Woods Hole, it was great. You're

27:47.651 --> 27:51.899
doing this in a very good way. But make a note 
sometime that if you would be interested in the

27:53.242 --> 27:59.434
discussions that went on, to formulate, well, to 
do three things. One is to establish what's so

28:04.088 --> 28:07.371
oceanographic. The other is to convert scripts 
from really a biological station into

28:07.391 --> 28:14.778
oceanography. And the third one was to goose up the 
University of Washington. There is a collection

28:19.843 --> 28:28.611
of the correspondence and handwritten committee 
notes and everything else of Frank Willey. which I

28:29.890 --> 28:36.300
managed to save by a series of accidents, they're 
over in the MBL library. And that's something that

28:37.642 --> 28:53.586
if you want to really follow up on the sorts of 
discussions that went on by those characters at

28:37.642 --> 28:53.586
that time when they came up with this marvelous 
idea and they'd already sold Rockefeller

28:37.642 --> 28:53.586
Foundation to get some money for all these things. 
It's well worthwhile, so keep a note on that. If you

28:58.470 --> 29:13.408
ever get out of the, you might say, the Audible 
field, and someone wants to really look into the

28:58.470 --> 29:13.408
discussions that went on at that time, this was a 
National Academy of Sciences committee, and the

28:58.470 --> 29:13.408
discussions are terrific. And we were very 
fortunate in that we have a couple of file drawers

29:13.868 --> 29:23.640
of handwritten, mostly handwritten notes by the 
chairman of that committee, Frank Lilley.
