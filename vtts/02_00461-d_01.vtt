WEBVTT

00:02.343 --> 00:09.071
He said there were millionaires in this country. 
There were lots of guys that had over a million

00:09.091 --> 00:10.593
dollars. That's quite common. And I couldn't 
understand it, you know, because that term was

00:13.176 --> 00:19.083
unknown. Millionaires. Just to be a millionaire 
is a kind of a professional, so I might say. You

00:23.788 --> 00:25.070
know, that was unknown. We had some rich people, 
especially old families that had lots of land. and

00:29.782 --> 00:37.012
some industrialists, but they were not referred 
to as millionaires per se, like somebody can be a

00:29.782 --> 00:37.012
millionaire and not have a job. Yes, that's true. 
You know, per se, he's just a millionaire. So that

00:40.977 --> 00:47.606
was, naturally I wanted to find out all I could 
about this country, naturally. Curiosity was

00:47.907 --> 00:49.228
tremendous. And I wasn't going to find out 
anything by being shipped back or You know, nobody

00:54.723 --> 00:58.609
was going to tell me any more than I already knew in 
prison camp. So I felt that was another thing I, all

00:59.089 --> 01:08.964
these many reasons that I gave myself for 
escaping, you know, why I was doing this. I was just

01:08.984 --> 01:16.895
agonized over it for months

01:08.984 --> 01:16.895
and months and months. And I wanted to find what 
this common sense was that, that Germans seem to

01:22.955 --> 01:26.240
lack from WW1. Yes. Yes. I'll

01:28.263 --> 01:35.673
tell you a funny story about, Candy has heard it so 
many times. I'll tell a story where Mercury's Law,

01:38.117 --> 01:52.557
with the chorus girls from Reno that turned out to 
be, one of them turned out to be a German countess,

01:38.117 --> 01:52.557
according to her story. And I know she was German, 
but I could tell by the accent and her behavior when

01:52.908 --> 02:12.673
she would order, when she would have dark

01:52.908 --> 02:12.673
bread

01:52.908 --> 02:12.673
and German bread for breakfast. Yeah. And it 
was... In a sense, she did not suspect me of

02:16.651 --> 02:23.902
anything other than that I was an American ski 
instructor. But she must have sensed something

02:25.004 --> 02:31.554
because she did like me better than the other guys. 
So there was some attraction there. And

02:35.315 --> 02:44.846
fortunately nothing, it was no danger to me 
because she was, actually she moved in better

02:35.315 --> 02:44.846
circles. She had more income than I had. I couldn't 
keep up with her partying. She

02:51.875 --> 02:56.601
could pass better. She would speak in her accent 
and everybody thought it was cute. And that used to

03:00.425 --> 03:14.602
upset me because the Austrian ski instructors 
that would come over, they could speak horrible

03:00.425 --> 03:14.602
English and the girls would just laugh and laugh 
and they would think they were the cutest thing

03:00.425 --> 03:14.602
since you know what. And I had to carefully pick my 
words. I probably was considered dull because I

03:19.588 --> 03:22.652
couldn't speak fast enough, compete with these 
guys who were yodeling and, you know, they were

03:24.590 --> 03:32.284
just turning on their charm. And I couldn't read. 
It's very hard. That, I think, is difficult. You

03:36.191 --> 03:38.536
lose your charm as a fugitive. Because you haven't 
got the spontaneity that you need to be a

03:38.556 --> 03:43.665
professor. I must have been considered dull so 
many times that You know,

03:47.202 --> 03:58.339
what is the matter

03:47.202 --> 03:58.339
with them? Didn't you think something was going to 
happen? You

04:01.845 --> 04:08.015
were, at that point, a very confident, a super 
confident person. Remember what Cheryl said?

04:08.575 --> 04:11.700
Cheryl, my daughter, was 16 when I met all her 
little girlfriends over at the summer parties.

04:11.720 --> 04:13.844
And what she told you the other night, what she 
thought, she had no idea. Yeah, they thought it was

04:13.864 --> 04:14.745
something strange. They thought you were 
strange. Yeah. But then, you know... When all the

04:18.787 --> 04:26.260
friends would come over, they'd look at him and 
they'd say, who is this guy? Where did he come from?

04:27.762 --> 04:29.545
Where did you meet this guy? This was Palo Alto, 
California. They had a short history, so it was

04:32.630 --> 04:39.602
kind of... Usually because everybody talks at 
least about their school days. See, I couldn't

04:39.582 --> 04:41.604
even talk about my school days. But his accent at 
that time was a little heavier. But very few people

04:45.468 --> 04:48.612
called me on it, though. Very few people. Like the 
guys I worked for. I worked for the Clark brothers.

04:54.458 --> 04:55.940
They never said a word about my accent. We were even 
wearing Tyrolean hats. We were still involved

04:58.302 --> 04:59.724
those days. In the 50s. Very few people would call 
me on it. And if they did, then I would really slow

05:08.860 --> 05:15.952
down and check

05:08.860 --> 05:15.952
my, what I said more, be more careful. I used to 
correct him about his pronunciation, and then I, I

05:15.972 --> 05:32.860
felt that I was doing, it wasn't his problem, it was 
my problem, because you should not be correcting

05:15.972 --> 05:32.860
someone's grammar, so then I just stopped doing 
it, and then I didn't think about it anymore. And

05:33.430 --> 05:38.176
now, years later, he doesn't do that, or at least . 
It doesn't bother you? No. I'm absolutely

05:39.938 --> 05:54.395
astonished at his grasp of the English language, 
his range, and sometimes when he mispronounces

05:39.938 --> 05:54.395
things, I think it's delightful. It's not . People 
are very forgiving. Very forgiving.

06:02.810 --> 06:03.531
Amazing. Like I say, these girls, the more accent 
you had in those ski resorts, the better they liked

06:03.551 --> 06:08.579
you. And here I could have had an accent and I 
couldn't use it, you might say. You could have

06:16.491 --> 06:19.435
charmed the... Yeah. So I had to play the, I don't 
know

06:19.820 --> 06:33.937
what I played,

06:19.820 --> 06:33.937
you know, I just had to be, I didn't know. I kind of 
get a clue what you're

06:33.957 --> 06:45.571
saying, because when I was correcting you, it 
really, I didn't, you know, when you're married to

06:33.957 --> 06:45.571
somebody and they mispronounce things, that's, 
you're mispronounced, you know what I mean? Yes,

06:45.591 --> 06:45.771
yes. And so when I stopped correcting you on some 
basis, I was trying to come to terms with it. the

06:49.722 --> 06:54.232
distance between you, that you hadn't merged 
somehow, is it? Or you hadn't tried? He was saying

06:56.337 --> 07:04.355
that he was reluctant sometimes to talk, to say 
things because people were thinking he was dumb. I

07:04.375 --> 07:06.980
thought he was, is he dumb or something? Why is he 
saying it that way? Is that correct? And then later

07:09.668 --> 07:12.652
on, I realized, no, he's not young. And then I guess 
I got into it. I didn't really want to press him for

07:14.755 --> 07:21.765
fear of finding out he was something. I don't know. 
We have a whole... I put it into the area of

07:25.230 --> 07:29.716
non-importance. We'll have a whole evening when 
we go through your... What did you think about

07:29.756 --> 07:36.245
this? What did you think about that? How did you... 
You're going to be on the grill. Tell me what

07:43.143 --> 07:48.230
friends you had in the camp.

07:49.191 --> 07:56.000
We were all non-com officers, so we had the same 
rank. I think there were one or two guys left from my

07:56.020 --> 08:03.469
school, from Heidelberg, and the rest of them. I 
have some pictures of it. From Heidelberg? This

08:08.547 --> 08:09.369
isn't the military. No, from Canberra. From 
Canberra I have some pictures. Yes, but I have...

08:11.436 --> 08:12.901
Oh, that's the rings. Yeah, and I think you've seen 
those. No, but the... from Heidelberg, where were

08:17.472 --> 08:27.363
these... Well, the one guy that was assigned to the 
same unit, he may have been in the first camp, and

08:17.472 --> 08:27.363
then we got separated. Right, but when you say 
Heidelberg, you were trained in the Berlin camp.

08:31.227 --> 08:36.453
No, Heidelberg, never got to the Berlin... Oh, so 
you weren't at the Berlin Academy. No, never got

08:36.473 --> 08:37.794
there. That was the final one. But there were, I 
remember one or two that I was close with that are in

08:45.788 --> 08:51.594
these pictures and that came back, the memory came 
back. One of them was an artist, a very talented

08:51.614 --> 08:56.559
young man. He drew, did watercolors, did a lot of 
graphics that we all knew would hang on the wall and

08:56.579 --> 09:04.467
give away some journal proper. He did it in that 
same graphic, that old English thing that I do.

09:09.373 --> 09:10.193
Have you got those pictures? Maybe we can jar your 
memory while we're talking about the canvas.

09:30.052 --> 09:52.263
My

09:30.052 --> 09:52.263
mother

09:30.052 --> 09:52.263
said

09:30.052 --> 09:52.263
that to me once when I wrote a book once and 
dedicated it to my mother. Anyway, I remember my

09:52.443 --> 09:59.012
mother remarking to me once that this proved that 
she was here. Oh. Some of it you know.

10:15.467 --> 10:15.647
This one. Yes. Let me show you some . This is a letter 
I wrote to my parents. Not that. I have a copy of it.

10:19.192 --> 10:20.674
You have that? Yes. Yes. Now

10:22.111 --> 10:30.932
this, I think, is the original one that my Wanda 
poster is made of. Take a look at it. It sure is.

10:36.606 --> 10:39.613
Oh, they have got this.

10:53.566 --> 10:55.428
This one is where I learned to ski. There's a little 
ski hut outside of Schwedens that belonged to the

10:55.748 --> 11:01.714
local merchants. And I'm demonstrating the shoes 
position that my teachers... To your teachers?

11:07.400 --> 11:07.760
Oh, I see. They were teaching you. Yes. And race. 
Here's a hut. Here's a...

11:23.975 --> 11:27.865
So you were trained as a surveyor during the... 
Yeah. I would pick up these things. Whatever they

11:29.529 --> 11:30.992
taught me, I would learn. Anything that I kept, I 
was probably one of those fast learners. But I

11:36.746 --> 11:38.891
wouldn't necessarily keep it forever. But if 
there was a contest, you teach me something and

11:42.048 --> 11:45.351
then you say, okay, now who's going to be the 
fastest? You know, chances are it was first or

11:45.371 --> 11:47.453
second. Now this wasn't in Heidelberg, was it? No, 
this was, I'll show you, I have all the cities. Oh,

11:53.159 --> 11:54.320
okay. This is in Schwedens, that's the tennis 
side, I'm just going through my sports thing. This

11:59.025 --> 12:04.750
is our country club, court number one. This is 
Horst Trispel on the right, the one that decorated

12:04.770 --> 12:11.717
soldier and captain. young upcoming, he would 
have made it in politics or in the military either

12:12.575 --> 12:17.560
way. One of my favorites. He was one of those 
talented guys that you run across most likely to

12:20.564 --> 12:27.391
succeed. Flashing smile. He could have made it in 
Hollywood. He was good looking, laugh, outgoing,

12:30.854 --> 12:37.782
laughed, loved everybody, that type of thing. He 
was promoted to Hauptmann before Before I even got

12:41.093 --> 12:43.196
in, I think. Yes. Do you think he survived the war? I 
kind of doubt it, but you never know. It surprised

12:47.863 --> 12:48.544
me. My whole family survived it. Because they, you 
know, just never know. But, you know, guys like

12:52.831 --> 12:58.860
him, I don't know. It's hard to say. He was one of 
those elite, most advanced troops, motorized.

13:05.129 --> 13:10.257
The big guns, bigger than anything that I was 
involved in.

13:13.696 --> 13:18.181
Now this is a train that they, you can see we have the 
African Unicorn on it. We were shipped by these

13:18.461 --> 13:22.786
cattle cars with straw on the floor. Believe me, 
it's hard to sleep in those things. Of course, the

13:25.829 --> 13:28.732
day is on end on these cattle cars. But I did get to 
see Yugoslavia and some of those countries. I just

13:32.516 --> 13:33.818
thought it was pretty cool. On your way down to 
Greece. Yeah, on my way down to Greece. Now where

13:37.682 --> 13:38.763
were these pictures kept? These were in the hands 
of your sister. Yeah, and my nieces got it. My

13:42.487 --> 13:43.348
sister, yeah. And here's what I think is the gypsy 
that told me I was going to take a long, long trip.

13:54.011 --> 13:57.516
Well, it was pretty safe considering that you're 
on your way to Africa. But I said Africa, and she

13:57.776 --> 14:02.202
says, no, they're all very mysterious. We got our 
money's worth.

14:10.513 --> 14:11.614
And here's some You were asking me, I was going to 
ask you a question about my body. The guy on the

14:14.829 --> 14:19.535
right, he was in camp with me, in several camps with 
me. He was in my outfit in Africa. I do remember he

14:22.179 --> 14:27.186
had one thumb missing, one finger missing. And he 
had a lot of acne scars. And he was very exact, a very

14:30.470 --> 14:34.275
reserved kind of person. But a nice, real nice guy. 
He's still in the back.

14:51.520 --> 14:56.166
This is a, as a student, he said knickerbockers. 
Oh, yes, yes, knickers. They were Australian

14:57.568 --> 15:00.532
wool, beautiful knickers. I don't know where he 
found that stuff. He was traveling, you know, he

15:03.396 --> 15:15.972
went to Breslau, the capital, and so he saw a lot 
more and he moved around a lot more than most people

15:03.396 --> 15:15.972
because of his job. He's the artist, but he was a 
knickerbocker. Oh, I see.

15:22.908 --> 15:43.751
Very

15:22.908 --> 15:43.751
talented artist. What was his name again? .

15:55.088 --> 16:03.602
My mother and father raised my sister's two girls. 
So they had another family, so to speak. Because my

16:06.698 --> 16:12.184
sister stayed behind in Twightness for some 
reason, unbeknownst to me. It's in her letter.

16:14.166 --> 16:14.566
Pardon? It's in her letter. Why she stayed there?

16:19.692 --> 16:20.773
She worked on the farm. And she gave up her two 
children to your parents? Yes, to get him over the

16:24.156 --> 16:25.838
border. Somehow they didn't get her out for some 
reason. What happened to Herbert? Herbert got

16:30.103 --> 16:31.264
out. So they all left your sister? I believe so. 
That's the impression I got, that Herbert got out

16:35.369 --> 16:39.774
first, and then my sister got out last. But 
according to the girl, well, according to

16:40.275 --> 16:46.062
Rosalita, the woman we met, I suppose. Who's 
Rosalita? She's the youngest, his youngest

16:46.683 --> 16:50.107
niece. All right, of these two that your parents 
raised. Yeah. That the two girls were smuggled out

16:53.171 --> 16:59.098
by, I have

16:59.551 --> 17:22.504
pictures of them. with the two babies. My mother 
here, she's got these two little children. And my

17:30.652 --> 17:34.877
father had already had a serious accident on his 
job. He was run over by one of his freight cars and

17:34.957 --> 17:40.564
broke his upper thigh. And one leg was shorter than 
the other slightly. There was when I was still On

17:46.126 --> 17:47.768
the run. I was just a student. I remember visiting 
him in the hospital. So he was put into the labor, on

17:51.753 --> 17:55.117
a labor crew. My father was put on the labor crew, on 
the railroad, you know, the labor gang that goes

17:55.277 --> 18:08.074
out and checks the ties when he was probably 16 
years old. Somehow he escaped to the west side and

18:08.134 --> 18:13.100
got his old job back as a headmaster. Oh, it was the 
Russians that put him on the labor crew. Yeah. Got

18:15.503 --> 18:15.643
it. The Russians put him on the labor crews. But I 
don't know. I don't know the details of his escape.

18:22.046 --> 18:34.637
But once he got out, then he managed to get my mother 
and everybody else, two nieces out, and last, my

18:22.046 --> 18:34.637
sister. And I knew he was the only one that could do 
it. A guy like me, my age, you go into the nearest

18:39.061 --> 18:44.626
labor camp, no matter what. Absolutely. What's 
your story is, you know? Older guys, he was

18:47.500 --> 18:50.565
probably old enough that they let him go. And 
young, old women, they were okay, you know. But

18:55.593 --> 19:00.260
guys, army age, it's just... You know, right to a 
labor. Yeah. Let me ask you about the, we've gone

19:00.841 --> 19:07.652
through the camps, just shifted from camp to camp 
in a routine way. How did you find out when it was

19:08.088 --> 19:12.975
time to be shifted to another camp? Did rumors go 
through the camp, or all of a sudden they blew the

19:13.015 --> 19:20.485
whistles and everyone said, line up, get your 
stuff, we're moving to another place? It was

19:20.505 --> 19:24.431
announced, it was posted, I believe. Only certain 
people went? Yeah, it was always a selective

19:26.093 --> 19:32.942
process, which we never could figure out what it 
was. We didn't seem to, I mean, we felt that it could

19:33.002 --> 19:37.048
be something else. oh yes i just wondered if we 
never even thought about it much this i only found

19:37.518 --> 20:02.665
out later that there was some rhyme or reason 
behind it there were some big decisions being made

19:37.518 --> 20:02.665
somewhere else but we just thought it was routine 
because it's probably a good idea not to let him get

19:37.518 --> 20:02.665
too too too familiar with the with the area yes i 
think that's what i thought did you um And as soon as

20:03.556 --> 20:07.500
you moved to a new camp, you immediately made 
another camp translator? Usually it turned out

20:08.201 --> 20:16.629
that way, in most cases, because, like I say, very 
few people spoke as well as I did. Yes, I can see. I

20:17.690 --> 20:25.858
mean, they always had somebody who could speak a 
little English, but they didn't have the command

20:17.690 --> 20:25.858
that I had, so they always took me in. Even if they 
had another translator, they'd say, come on

20:26.278 --> 20:32.044
along, you know, just in case.

20:34.150 --> 20:39.618
And then gave me the job of translating those 
people articles. And the Wehrmacht, their daily

20:39.638 --> 20:51.235
news bulletin or something, the battles and 
various fronts and all that. And you were never

20:51.255 --> 20:56.303
accused of being pro-American, anti-American, 
pro-Nazi, anti? I don't know. I'm not sure about

20:58.366 --> 21:02.672
that, to be honest with you. I'm not sure, because I

21:04.289 --> 21:10.061
don't know. There were some, a lot of things were 
going on, and there were some rumors, but nothing

21:11.584 --> 21:20.682
was really personal that I know of. And I just kind 
of tried to stay out of this when it got political,

21:20.702 --> 21:25.993
this area. We left these guys alone, these hard 
Nazi guys. And they stayed too. I was in my camps.

21:38.215 --> 21:45.064
Did you have anybody in the camps from the 999th

21:38.215 --> 21:45.064
penal battalion that was with the Africa Corps? It 
was the 999. What was that? They were some

21:49.169 --> 21:50.270
special... It was a penal, a disciplinary 
battalion attached to the Africa Corps. And many

21:56.365 --> 22:10.664
of them were anti-Nazis, many of them were 
criminals, many of them were, you know, they

21:56.365 --> 22:10.664
formed a unit called the 999.

22:10.684 --> 22:18.254
When you got to Lawrenceburg, did you ever 
participate on the camp newspaper, Lagosaito, or

22:10.684 --> 22:18.254
anything like that? Well, I did the translation, 
but uh and read the paper but i don't i don't publish

22:22.808 --> 22:51.870
anything no because the every campaign usually 
had a newspaper yeah i remember publishing one

22:22.808 --> 22:51.870
story once and they wanted more but i didn't know 
anymore it was the story about the okay guy where

22:22.808 --> 22:51.870
the where the origin of okay came from and i don't 
know where i read that but it's supposed to came

22:22.808 --> 22:51.870
from come from Otto Krause or something. He signed 
his cars that way in Detroit. And there was

22:59.598 --> 23:04.202
supposed to be a sign that was a good car or 
something. And they, naturally, they camped.

23:07.024 --> 23:08.506
They all thought there was a great story. Oh, yes, 
that is good. If you have more, I thought that's the

23:09.246 --> 23:12.730
only one I had. But I've heard different stories 
ever since. That sounds good. Otto Krause. Otto

23:17.894 --> 23:19.316
Krause. Krause, I think. Krause. The war is over. 
How did the other prisoners react to the end of the

23:25.693 --> 23:30.401
war? April, May 1st, May 2nd, May 3rd.

23:38.915 --> 23:40.939
Everybody kept to themselves. It was a shell 
shock.

23:45.166 --> 23:47.670
But they knew the war had been going badly. 
Couldn't have been it. It wasn't, well, some of

23:48.922 --> 23:56.149
them, they wouldn't really, they didn't want to 
leave. They couldn't leave because things must

23:56.169 --> 24:05.197
have changed really fast, like from the time I 
left, which wasn't all that long, and it was

23:56.169 --> 24:05.197
absolute quiet. There were no battles ranging 
when I left. Right. In Germany, probably. In

24:11.303 --> 24:13.005
Germany, or even anywhere else. No, it's true. We 
didn't hit the beaches until 44. See, it was all in a

24:15.327 --> 24:18.490
relatively short time. There were no big battles 
that Stalingrad had after those battles.

24:30.670 --> 24:36.120
They couldn't believe it.

24:36.140 --> 24:42.891
Did you ever meet anybody inside the camps that 
were involved in concentration camps or things

24:36.140 --> 24:42.891
like that? Just

24:43.377 --> 24:54.911
military personnel?

24:54.931 --> 24:56.713
Never. I would think they were special units, like 
the SS or something. But these are strictly...

24:59.796 --> 25:07.425
Military personnel. Military, army, kind of... 
If anything, we had a mixture of career. Army guys,

25:08.807 --> 25:12.011
officers, and I'd say 20% or so, 23% were career. 
Oh, I see. I see. And they were, you know, they were

25:13.516 --> 25:30.958
maybe stubborn and very proud type, patriotic 
type, because they were trained to be that way,

25:13.516 --> 25:30.958
because they were a regular army.

25:30.978 --> 25:33.521
But other than that, nothing in the concentration 
camps. The stories, we didn't, I'm trying to think

25:33.541 --> 25:42.713
when I heard, the stories about concentration 
camps, first

25:43.739 --> 25:49.507
time in which camp it would be even if it wasn't. It 
might have been afterwards. They came out

25:51.350 --> 25:54.735
relatively late. But the relationship between 
the guards

25:54.755 --> 26:11.940
and officers, the American officers and the other 
persons got worse from camp to camp. started

26:12.950 --> 26:33.051
all on

26:12.950 --> 26:33.051
beautiful and then they were walking around with 
real strange expressions on their faces

26:12.950 --> 26:33.051
you know for us because we didn't know what and then 
But

26:34.162 --> 26:43.142
I don't remember hearing any of these 
concentration stories of especially killings.

26:43.375 --> 26:51.563
To me, a concentration camp might have been a 
translation of any camp that has a bar choir around

26:43.375 --> 26:51.563
it, where you concentrate people. That would be my 
translation of a concentration camp, at least. In

26:58.549 --> 27:04.275
the German dictionary, there wouldn't be any word 
other than concentrating people. That's where it

27:04.475 --> 27:09.219
comes from. So I figured a prison camp of people. 
And perhaps the guards knew more than the

27:13.328 --> 27:18.415
prisoners did, and it showed in their 
expressions. Yeah. Yeah, it did show.

27:25.586 --> 27:30.693
But I knew there was something like that going on. I 
could read. I had enough sensitivity in those

27:31.414 --> 27:36.822
days, and that served me well later on, because I 
do... know when people are upset about something.

27:41.384 --> 27:47.512
I can read their faces and make them feel 
insensitive too. So that everyone was depressed,

27:47.532 --> 28:00.831
the end of the war had come, everybody's trying to 
make plans to figure out what the rumors are,

27:47.532 --> 28:00.831
what's going to happen to you. Food was great. I had 
read, having access to newspapers, that we were

28:02.688 --> 28:14.682
all going to be sent

28:02.688 --> 28:14.682
back to our homeland, wherever we came from.

28:14.702 --> 28:19.888
But in my case, there was no place to go. There was no 
homeland left. And if they made good at sending me

28:20.468 --> 28:23.952
back where I came from, I was in real trouble. Go 
back to the Soviet zone. Yeah. since I had no

28:28.338 --> 28:35.888
attorney or anybody to clarify this thing, 
because I was probably one of the few from that

28:28.338 --> 28:35.888
area. Most of them were from the main part of 
Germany, you know, like a big city, and they had no

28:37.390 --> 28:45.221
problem, and they had no quarrel. No, it's not.

29:01.463 --> 29:02.765
Is it still a heart founder for you? Yeah, just 
briefly when you said it. Did you notice this went

29:05.649 --> 29:08.052
upside down? Yes, very good. Oh, they better do 
that. As I was chatting with Candy,

29:14.380 --> 29:29.901
one of the motivations, very strong ones, among 
the many motivations, it's not just anyone,

29:14.380 --> 29:29.901
didn't want to be sent back not only to someplace 
where somebody else decided to send me back to. And

29:35.059 --> 29:47.476
it was worth taking a risk because I'd followed 
orders long enough and this is all over and this is

29:35.059 --> 29:47.476
pow. So I felt there was no need to continue this 
same kind of thing. I thought, you know, this is

29:52.523 --> 29:54.826
enough. And I'm going to go, even if I... rot in some 
jungle in South America because my original plan

29:58.265 --> 30:06.842
was to go to South America somehow. I had no idea 
what it was. But I had no idea. I figured I was going

30:11.833 --> 30:14.518
to make cigarette cases out of would sell them to 
somebody for something some artisan

30:15.680 --> 30:43.054
but i certainly didn't want anyone to tell me where 
to go and it was worth taking a big risk getting shot

30:15.680 --> 30:43.054
or whatever had there been any escapes from your 
camp until then uh there had been escapes from

30:15.680 --> 30:43.054
camps that i was in i don't know which one it was And 
we could hear gunfire quite often, once a month or

30:43.928 --> 30:49.913
so. There were some gunfires that sometimes 
prisoners would get killed. And we would be told we

30:56.780 --> 31:00.203
were either trying to escape or we touched the 
wire. Now, there were tensions sometimes to the

31:00.223 --> 31:10.432
point we were told that we would be shot if we just 
touched the wire, say, or something like that. So

31:10.452 --> 31:13.935
there was enough to... And you'd hear some... five 
or six shots.

31:19.641 --> 31:23.867
But never, you know, we never got any details. I 
figured it's tough. Maybe I was a little more

31:27.311 --> 31:34.501
calloused, because I just felt some of these 
things. I'd read enough about the Russian prison

31:35.102 --> 31:44.074
camps of WWI, so nothing really, which were, were 
nothing like that. So when you escaped, you were

31:44.830 --> 31:49.735
reasonably sure that they would shoot at you. Oh, 
absolutely. So you're taking a big chance. Oh,

31:52.057 --> 31:53.158
yeah. In those days, Turkey and, you know, there 
was nothing much friendly, weaponizing going on.

31:59.904 --> 32:08.312
And I'm sure they had, you know, they were sitting 
up there with their machine guns and their big,

31:59.904 --> 32:08.312
those big searchlights were going all night long. 
You know, that was the chance it took, so. But,

32:13.037 --> 32:14.078
uh... I just did not want anybody to tell me where to 
go. Even to this day, when I agonized every once in a

32:18.387 --> 32:23.954
while, you know, should I turn myself in? Why am I 
keeping on the ground? Well, because if I turn

32:26.156 --> 32:43.137
myself in, I'm going to have to fill out forms, and 
they're going to put me in a holding cell, and

32:26.156 --> 32:43.137
they're going to leave me in there for X number of 
days and nights, and they're going to, then

32:26.156 --> 32:43.137
somebody's going to tell me and give me a ticket or 
not a ticket, tell me where to go. some Timbuktu.

32:46.006 --> 32:46.467
Why would I? I'm perfectly happy where I am, even if 
I'm a fruit picker. I'd rather be a fruit picker

32:50.013 --> 32:52.777
than be told where to go. And especially when I, 
being out west of the mansion to Kandy, that is

32:53.999 --> 33:08.702
something that's understood, that you just, your 
simple freedom, you don't ask for much, just leave

32:53.999 --> 33:08.702
me alone, don't tell me where to go to, what to do. I 
don't mind doing my whatever work I have to do. And

33:15.759 --> 33:17.440
so that's very American. Yes. Yes, it is. Very 
pioneer. So it wasn't, here I was, you know, I had a

33:20.864 --> 33:28.212
kinship with the American West, you know. Yes. And 
I felt good about it. Oh, I read everything about

33:30.474 --> 33:32.336
the American West. Did you read Carl May stories, 
Old Shatterhand? Yes, yes, all these old stories.

33:37.161 --> 33:38.322
Old Winnetou. And The one at the Heralds Club in 
Reno, he had just opened up and the gambling

33:38.855 --> 33:47.408
started, I guess, in those days. And he had put in 
these 24 by 20 white glass panes, opaque, that

33:47.428 --> 34:08.220
somebody had painted a picture on of the Old West 
with a story, handwritten on it. And they were

34:09.314 --> 34:12.302
everywhere at the Herald's Club. Two stories or 
three stories high. I had no money to gamble. I had

34:17.234 --> 34:19.380
only pennies in my pocket. I would read these 
things. Everybody else was gambling. I spent

34:23.110 --> 34:24.854
hours. I read the Old West. I hope he kept those. I 
haven't been back. I think they're probably

34:29.611 --> 34:30.973
remodeled. But those paintings on those glass 
panes, I wished I could see them again. I wished

34:37.201 --> 34:40.725
somebody put them in a museum and charged money. 
They were priceless. The old judges, the outlaws,

34:42.788 --> 34:50.177
the shootings, the immigrants, the Indians, the 
whole bit. And the artist was good. So you were

34:54.573 --> 34:56.296
drawn in by the Old West. Oh, I just loved it. Maybe 
the old Carl Myh stories or the old Winnetou and

34:58.680 --> 35:04.190
Shatterhand. The Old West was very, I felt a 
kinship to that spirit. So I felt I wasn't that far

35:10.601 --> 35:14.087
off the track with what I was doing. I wasn't crazy. 
No, no, no. Well, you get doubts, you know, when

35:16.471 --> 35:18.775
you... all by yourself in some dark, miserable 
room, you know, what the heck am I doing here, you

35:19.447 --> 35:26.416
know? And the other story that struck a note with me 
was in the 50s, if I did have 50 cents or 25 cents, I

35:26.436 --> 35:45.202
used to go see these B pictures with the old 
detective stories, the Raymond Chandler

35:26.436 --> 35:45.202
stories. I'm the biggest Raymond Chandler fan 
ever. Alive, yeah. And Ross McDonald. Oh, yes, I

35:51.798 --> 35:52.359
remember. And that's about the man that is in the 
middle. He doesn't belong anywhere. He doesn't

35:58.469 --> 36:01.154
belong to the... And what is Rockford? Same thing. 
He doesn't belong... He doesn't belong to the...

36:04.400 --> 36:08.768
Police or to the criminals. And that's the way I 
always felt. Kinship for that time. And it's

36:12.094 --> 36:12.775
strange. What about the other population? How 
come they feel a kinship to this kind of person?

36:18.837 --> 36:19.999
He's a stranger. So there must be something that 
people can relate to. To a person like me. Of

36:28.471 --> 36:30.093
course. Rockford never makes any money. He works 
for practically nothing. He's not a success. He

36:37.604 --> 36:38.886
has the weirdest friends. And... And he's not 
police. But he's not a criminal. Outside the law.

36:47.812 --> 36:48.974
He breaks in, enters. He has his pick. And he's 
highly popular. Yes, and he's very principled.

36:56.142 --> 36:56.942
And he's still very principled. But he has his own 
integrity. Yes. With his friends. Yes. And that's

37:00.386 --> 37:01.207
exactly what happened. It's like Cyrano. Like 
Cyrano de Bergerac. That's the way I think. He has

37:04.631 --> 37:06.373
his own integrity. You know, everything else, my 
cover in the story is terrible, but... I always

37:10.501 --> 37:15.226
played it straight with my friends. When they find 
out who I am, the only apology I have is for lying

37:16.488 --> 37:27.901
about my cover, but not about our relationships. I 
had some enemies too, and I still don't like him to

37:27.941 --> 37:37.251
this day, but all my feelings I kept absolutely 
straight. Wouldn't it be a nice feeling in six

37:37.670 --> 37:47.305
months to write a book across the inside cover of 
this book to so-and-so? Now you know. We have a lot

37:50.110 --> 37:52.473
of apprehensions. I'm sorry, say that again? 
Apprehensions about that book. Really? Not

37:57.701 --> 37:58.743
apprehensions, really. Just... We are curious as 
to what the reactions are going to be. It's just

38:07.964 --> 38:11.448
going to flip out some of these people. My worst 
apprehensions were about Jean's parents.

38:18.056 --> 38:24.464
Because, you know, I could not see, I did not want to 
embarrass them. You know, I felt that would be such

38:24.484 --> 38:30.711
an embarrassment for middle America type people 
in a small community. Although it was not half as

38:31.163 --> 38:35.349
bad. It might not.

38:39.615 --> 38:40.075
I don't know. They were very bigoted people. 
Right, right. So they might have been reactive

38:44.922 --> 38:46.705
then. That was an amazing thing I found. There were 
lots more bigoted people in this country than I

38:48.307 --> 38:52.252
was. So things got more and more comfortable. To be 
an American is the simplest thing in the world. It

38:58.601 --> 39:00.023
was for me. I was practically born to be an 
American. Well, you're good at it. And I could talk

39:05.596 --> 39:07.980
it, and everybody would believe me. Because I 
really believed it. I could sell it. And you're

39:12.206 --> 39:13.749
good at it. Let me ask you, as you were thinking 
about breaking from the camp, see, I have to think.

39:20.519 --> 39:21.521
Yeah, I understand. So if I keep taking you back to 
these things, you're getting ready to break from

39:21.981 --> 39:26.348
the camp. Lordsburg, you're a demi-Air Force 
base, Army Air Force base in New Mexico. You have to

39:31.441 --> 39:35.926
decide when you're going to go, what you're going 
to do, what plans. You know that you're going to be

39:36.586 --> 39:40.390
shipped to Russia or to the Soviet zone soon. The 
rumors are. And by the way, just to, I don't think

39:41.311 --> 39:50.200
that you need confirmation, but if you do, you know 
that those people were shipped to the Soviet zone.

39:50.521 --> 39:52.383
I'm glad, in a sense, I'm not glad. Because those 
people who were in the Soviet, who did come to the

39:53.284 --> 39:56.487
Soviet zone, So

39:56.872 --> 40:02.260
what you did was exactly based on the right 
information. Yeah, because I had access to the

40:02.280 --> 40:06.888
newspapers. Because most of it, the articles, 
they wouldn't be interested in the Germans. I read

40:13.898 --> 40:15.641
the whole newspaper. They only wanted to know 
about the battles and all that stuff. But I read the

40:20.328 --> 40:22.591
whole thing. I could read between the lines.

40:28.758 --> 40:39.592
I understood the political, you know, the 
alliance, the allied, what is called the allied

40:28.758 --> 40:39.592
alliance, probably.

40:39.612 --> 40:40.733
So we're in the camp. It's August, moving towards 
September 1945. The war is over. The war is almost

40:45.579 --> 40:47.702
over against the Japanese. At the beginning of 
September of 1945. I remember the atomic bomb. The

40:51.217 --> 40:52.979
atomic bomb was dropped on them in August. Yeah, I 
remember them standing in the hall, the mess hall.

40:55.041 --> 40:56.463
August 6th and then August 9th. You have to make a 
decision soon. Yes. You're going to leave.

41:02.389 --> 41:03.250
September. September. I figured I agonized about 
a month. Okay, so a month you worried about it. Did

41:09.577 --> 41:12.200
you collect things that you needed to go? No, just I 
had... All I needed was... a set of clothes without

41:18.614 --> 41:23.261
the P-O-W or P-W on it. And they came back from the 
laundry sometimes without anything on it. Oh,

41:29.071 --> 41:29.792
that's good. You didn't have to take it out or 
anything. Just for some reason, that paint

41:31.475 --> 41:33.859
wouldn't stick. And it came back perfectly clean. 
So all you had to do is keep one set like that. So

41:41.371 --> 41:42.713
we're talking about a T-shirt? T-shirt and a 
jacket. Some kind of thing. Fatigue. Yeah. Pants.

41:48.053 --> 41:49.615
They were on the pants and they were everywhere. I 
think we had a dark blue denim type of jacket or

41:49.655 --> 41:57.745
shirt and a white t-shirt and a pair of pants. I 
think that's what we had. All you had to do was save

41:59.627 --> 42:02.611
the one that came back from the laundry. They had 
these real powerful detergents, you know, that

42:02.671 --> 42:08.298
take anything out. We were supposed to put it back 
in, but... If you didn't, they'd hand it to you. It

42:15.723 --> 42:16.685
was all folded up. You didn't know when you opened 
it up, it had nothing in it. So now you put that away.

42:21.812 --> 42:22.874
Yeah, you saved the set. So you're planning, do you 
know where you're going to go when you get out?

42:28.622 --> 42:29.744
Yeah, probably Peru. Oh, I mean, from here to the 
next town. No, no town. You can see a town that's in

42:36.473 --> 42:40.579
the middle of a desert. nothing but tumbleweeds, 
and a mountain in the background, very much like

42:40.964 --> 42:50.056
that. And you could see a bus, and sometimes the sun 
would hit some glass or something, and

42:50.077 --> 43:02.634
you could see something moving way, way 
underneath it, tiny underneath it, on a road

42:50.077 --> 43:02.634
there. Maybe a railroad car that looked like it,

43:02.654 --> 43:09.163
but you couldn't really be sure. Well, I think 
basically, See, to me, since they were going to

43:11.693 --> 43:19.984
tell me where to go, all I had to do was get away from 
them. Yes. Yes. It's very reasonable. First, get

43:23.008 --> 43:24.730
away from them. Yes. Go to somebody else. Yes. 
Forget them. And go from there. Had you met any

43:31.540 --> 43:33.823
local farmers? Had you met any people in the area? 
So you had no contact with anybody around there.

43:40.051 --> 43:41.633
Did you consider taking somebody with you? No. 
This was a solo effort you intended to go on.

43:47.076 --> 43:48.398
Because I cannot stand it. Because it takes, you 
know, split decisions, and I wouldn't want to

43:50.420 --> 43:58.850
screw anybody else up, and I wouldn't want 
somebody else to screw me up. So in a matter of this

43:59.591 --> 44:02.455
importance... Right. You're bullied by 
yourself. I think you do this yourself. So it's

44:05.538 --> 44:07.481
September 21st. The sun is going down. They're 
going to

44:10.705 --> 44:15.315
a movie. I

44:15.335 --> 44:28.665
knew there was a movie show. How many people in the 
cave do you think? I like it. So I figured, you know,

44:32.339 --> 44:36.385
while they're gone, they won't miss me for two 
hours. Well, there can't be a count while they're

44:36.465 --> 44:40.111
in the movie. They might have a count afterwards,

44:40.512 --> 44:46.441
but they can't. And I went to the washroom. And 
that's where I waited and agonized some more.

44:52.490 --> 44:54.533
Bright lights, and I looked in the mirror. You talk 
about the Welsh schmertz. It's really, really

44:58.203 --> 45:00.105
good. I mean, I had a rock in my stomach, you know, 
could hardly move. And you freeze. You're

45:07.574 --> 45:09.757
shivering. So

45:09.777 --> 45:15.765
you're cold. You're shivering. So I stepped 
outside. Now I'm formulating a plan. You had given

45:21.464 --> 45:23.828
no thought to, you didn't have a map? No. You didn't 
know where Lordsburg was? No. Where any of the

45:26.052 --> 45:27.114
local towns were? If I'd known where Lordsburg 
were, I would have gone the other way anyway. I see.

45:31.581 --> 45:40.877
I felt you've got to get the maximum distance 
between them that we're going to send you some of

45:31.581 --> 45:40.877
this. Maximum distance.

45:44.682 --> 45:48.266
And here it is, the fullest moon I've ever seen in my 
life. You could see, you know, for a mile, you could

45:48.286 --> 45:52.651
see a jackrabbit.

45:55.775 --> 45:56.696
Should I call it off? You know, I thought it was 
going to be dark. This is night. See, I had not

45:59.920 --> 46:02.383
studied the moon. That's how. But the one good 
thing, and I took another look. The moon made great

46:08.870 --> 46:10.572
shadows. In other words, you had a shadow. You had 
someplace to hide.
