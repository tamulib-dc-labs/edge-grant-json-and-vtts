00:01.972 --> 00:05.635
Today is March the 5th, 1990. This will be an 
interview with Dr. Lawrence Wolkin, professor at

00:06.316 --> 00:15.585
Texas A&M University, an interview recorded in 
his home.

00:19.689 --> 00:28.317
Dr. Wolkin, I understand that the first week in 
June of 1989, you had the opportunity to be in

00:19.689 --> 00:28.317
China. And those of us in the United States were 
watching what was developing in Tiananmen

00:29.191 --> 00:35.438
Square. Could you share with us what you were doing 
in China at that time? I had gone over there. I got

00:41.946 --> 00:51.057
there on Monday, the 29th of May, and was going to be 
there for two weeks to participate in some

00:41.946 --> 00:51.057
conferences that were going on in Beijing. 
Actually, the conference for the second week had

00:55.617 --> 01:24.426
already been canceled because of these student 
demonstrations, but they were going to go ahead

00:55.617 --> 01:24.426
with the conference during the first week, which 
was focusing on Americans doing business in China

00:55.617 --> 01:24.426
and some of the problems I might run into, designed 
mainly for businessmen who wanted to meet their

00:55.617 --> 01:24.426
counterparts in China so they could start doing 
some negotiations for some joint ventures or

00:55.617 --> 01:24.426
buying and selling the products. Because I had to 
get my ticket early, I couldn't change the time on

01:24.440 --> 01:31.109
it, so I was going to be there for two weeks anyway. 
So I figured that second week, instead of going to

01:31.230 --> 01:47.933
the conference, I would spend some time visiting 
with my friends and trying to, as best I could,

01:31.230 --> 01:47.933
determine how much change had taken place in China 
since we were there in 85, 86. And during that

01:48.537 --> 02:00.371
second week, my two older children were going to 
come over and practice their Chinese and visit

01:48.537 --> 02:00.371
with some of their friends and see some of the 
places that they come out when we were there in

01:48.537 --> 02:00.371
Beijing.

02:03.254 --> 02:08.380
How long before this particular event did you make 
your plans? Did you know? It was early in the spring

02:10.262 --> 02:18.392
in March when I had gotten permission from the 
university to go over there and have gotten some

02:19.030 --> 02:32.930
funding from a couple of the centers there at the 
university to attend these meetings and conduct

02:19.030 --> 02:32.930
some more research there in China. But as the 
demonstrations were going on, of course, I was

02:32.950 --> 02:46.590
keeping as close in contact with the people that I 
knew in China and with people that I knew here

02:47.043 --> 02:56.696
having them help me interpret the events that were 
going on as they were watching them on television

02:47.043 --> 02:56.696
as to whether or not it would be safe to go over 
there. So it was over a month and a half time period

02:57.377 --> 03:02.364
there. We were watching the news very closely and 
trying to determine what the situation really was

03:02.765 --> 03:15.042
in China and if it really posed any threat to 
foreigners. Okay. Well, it sounds like you were in

03:17.568 --> 03:23.015
a position to have some inside knowledge with 
these other people. You've mentioned being there

03:23.056 --> 03:26.000
in the school year of 1985, 86? Yes. In

03:27.101 --> 03:34.051
what situation, what basis were you there? I was 
there to teach at a university there in Beijing,

03:34.751 --> 03:43.223
the University of International Business and 
Economics. each year bring in several foreign

03:43.473 --> 03:49.162
experts from different parts of the world. Some of 
them there are there to help with English language

03:49.783 --> 04:09.075
for the students at the university, but I was there 
to teach Western economics, international

03:49.783 --> 04:09.075
trade, international finance, because the 
students at this university would be assigned

03:49.783 --> 04:09.075
after graduation to major corporations in China 
that are involved in international trade. They'd

04:14.692 --> 04:25.322
be assigned into the Ministry of Finance, into the 
Bank of China, into the various levels of the

04:14.692 --> 04:25.322
Chinese economy and government that are dealing 
with foreign countries. And as part of the reforms

04:25.382 --> 04:35.351
at that time, China was looking towards opening 
the country economically in other ways to the rest

04:25.382 --> 04:35.351
of the world. And they needed some people who were 
trained in the ways of doing business in these

04:39.498 --> 04:51.593
other countries, because the Chinese do things in 
a very different way, and they need to have some

04:39.498 --> 04:51.593
understanding of how business is conducted in 
other countries. And the school that these

04:52.273 --> 04:54.997
students were attending, what was that called? 
It's the University of International Business

04:55.497 --> 04:57.820
and Economics. It's one of their best 
universities. The universities in China are much

05:01.464 --> 05:09.454
more specific than our universities here. in that 
they focus on a single subject area. The one that I

05:13.864 --> 05:17.347
was at focused on international business and 
economics. There was another university in

05:17.367 --> 05:23.812
Beijing that focused on Chinese business and 
economics. Even within the different sciences,

05:23.832 --> 05:31.539
there are different universities that are 
devoted to biological sciences versus physics,

05:23.832 --> 05:31.539
chemistry. Their universities really are more 
comparable to a college within a university here

05:38.206 --> 05:40.449
in the United States. But under the reforms, 
they've been trying to somewhat broaden the scope

05:41.531 --> 05:53.308
of the courses that are taught in their various 
universities and institutions of higher

05:41.531 --> 05:53.308
education. But they're in the process of 
rebuilding their whole educational system,

05:53.928 --> 06:02.841
which was disrupted, to put it mildly, during the 
Cultural Revolution. Back in the 1960s. from 1966

06:04.362 --> 06:06.784
to 1976. The university that I taught at was closed 
down for three years in the early 70s, as were most

06:06.985 --> 06:14.732
of the universities in China. So they're just now 
trying to get their educational system back on

06:14.752 --> 06:20.558
track. They lost a whole generation of educated 
people. At the university level, you have

06:24.242 --> 06:32.530
professors who are in the 50-plus age range, and 
then There's a big gap. And then there's younger

06:34.050 --> 06:42.740
professors who are in their maybe 20s or early 30s 
who have gotten a college education in the last 10

06:34.050 --> 06:42.740
years. And there's a big gap in between them. They 
just don't receive a college education. They

06:48.006 --> 06:55.894
don't have the trained people who can teach the 
college classes. So they're rebuilding. Sounds

06:59.560 --> 07:01.822
as if that would be across all disciplines. Yes, 
that everything was closed down. Let me ask to

07:05.165 --> 07:13.293
clarify, you were teaching at Texas A&M, and then 
how did you get the position in China? Did you go

07:13.313 --> 07:14.554
there singly? Yeah, I just saw a little ad that said 
that there was a university in China that was

07:15.094 --> 07:26.385
looking for someone to teach economics during the 
coming academic year. And if you wanted more

07:26.405 --> 07:28.707
information, here is an address. to write off to, 
and it was in this strange sounding city called

07:29.328 --> 07:33.954
Beijing. That was before we in America realized 
that Peking was really an outdated

07:35.396 --> 07:45.009
pronunciation, and Beijing is closer to the true 
Chinese. I spent an hour in the map of the library

07:45.811 --> 07:56.365
trying to find out where the city was, but it was a 
small town out somewhere, and finally somebody

07:45.811 --> 07:56.365
came in and said that they thought that that the 
Chinese had changed the name from Peking to

07:57.458 --> 08:00.961
Beijing. Finally, we did find that on one map. Come 
to realize you're talking about the capital of the

08:04.665 --> 08:06.907
country. The capital of the country, yes. Okay, so 
you answered an ad and then left the United States

08:08.568 --> 08:15.275
and spent a full nine months there. We were there 
from the end of August in 85 to the first of July in

08:15.315 --> 08:21.321
86. Okay, now you said we. Who was involved in that? 
My entire family went with me. My wife, and our

08:26.652 --> 08:27.894
three children. At the time, our daughter was in 
the eighth grade, and our oldest son was in the

08:28.615 --> 08:36.466
sixth grade, and our youngest son was two and a half 
years old. So all five of you made the trip and lived

08:37.627 --> 08:40.752
there together. All five of us lived that year in 
Beijing, yeah. That must have been an experience.

08:47.121 --> 08:54.651
So the friends you mentioned in 1989 being in 
contact with before you made the trip in Beijing,

08:54.985 --> 09:23.001
late may of 1989 were these people that you had 
contacted or that you knew from your previous

08:54.985 --> 09:23.001
visit these were people that i had known from our 
previous visit and had come into contact with

08:54.985 --> 09:23.001
since then in communications back and forth 
division just a kind of off the wall question in

08:54.985 --> 09:23.001
terms of how does the language how did how did you 
deal with that both the first visit and then the

08:54.985 --> 09:23.001
second I do not speak Chinese, and that was one of 
the things that I wrote the university when I first

09:23.555 --> 09:39.473
responded to that ad, but the university I taught 
at, the students had six years of English before

09:23.555 --> 09:39.473
they got there, because English is the language 
that she used in her national business. The

09:40.394 --> 09:49.304
Chinese even use English as their language in 
business deals with the Soviet Union and the other

09:40.394 --> 09:49.304
Eastern Bloc nations. The students at the 
university where I taught their freshman and

09:53.153 --> 09:57.978
sophomore year took more intensive study in 
English. And as a matter of fact, my wife ended up

09:58.999 --> 10:04.884
teaching a freshman English class. And they had 
some other foreign experts there who taught

10:05.244 --> 10:11.871
different courses in English. So the seniors and 
graduate students that I was working with

10:11.911 --> 10:21.760
understood English quite well and could make 
themselves understood. language was not a

10:22.128 --> 10:23.410
problem. Our two older children learned quite a 
bit of Chinese while we were there. My wife and I

10:28.017 --> 10:42.017
ended up spending most of our time helping some 
Chinese work on improving their English, so we did

10:28.017 --> 10:42.017
not take full advantage of the opportunity we had 
of learning some Chinese. Again, when I went back

10:43.419 --> 10:49.468
in 89, we had some interpreters at the conferences 
we were at. And some of the Chinese who were making

10:52.021 --> 10:57.970
presentations spoke English. It's, I guess, 
typical around the world. We as Americans go

11:01.195 --> 11:04.140
everywhere and expect everybody else to speak 
English. And I really feel ashamed of myself and

11:04.160 --> 11:12.412
our country in the sense that we have very few 
people who are bilingual. We always depend on the

11:12.432 --> 11:16.038
other people to speak our language. And I think 
that we need to improve on that. You found that the

11:19.452 --> 11:22.335
same when you traveled to Japan and so forth. In 
Japan and in Europe, it's not unusual to run across

11:22.936 --> 11:30.965
people who speak two, three, four languages 
fluently. Okay. I'd like us to kind of go back then.

11:35.370 --> 11:39.214
You flew from the United States into the airport in 
Beijing. Yes. We stopped in Shanghai on the way,

11:41.317 --> 11:47.443
but that's where we entered the country for 
customs purposes and then on up to Beijing. Okay. I

11:49.220 --> 11:57.072
understand that the airport is about 30 
kilometers from the center of the city, or what

11:49.220 --> 11:57.072
kind of a ride did you have in? I'm kind of curious, 
when you got there and landed, what you were seeing

11:57.453 --> 12:07.849
or keeping an eye out for as you headed towards 
where the conference would be held. The airport in

12:07.869 --> 12:16.662
Beijing is, in several situations, 
intercontinental airport there in Houston, and

12:07.869 --> 12:16.662
it's outside of town about 15, 20 miles on the 
northeast side of town. Once I landed, a friend of

12:21.247 --> 12:32.817
mine came and picked me up and took me to the hotel 
where I was staying on the northeast side of

12:21.247 --> 12:32.817
Beijing. So I was able to, on that ride in, both get 
some information about what was going on in China

12:33.397 --> 12:46.429
and in Beijing in particular, and able to see for 
myself what was happening. Of course, one of the

12:47.984 --> 13:10.112
things I was looking for was any evidence of troop 
build-ups around Beijing, because in the weeks

12:47.984 --> 13:10.112
prior to that, there had been some troop movement 
into Beijing, and a number of times the troops had

12:47.984 --> 13:10.112
tried to go into the capital, but had been stopped 
by people coming up the streets. So these are some

13:11.134 --> 13:16.821
of the things that I was looking for, and trying to, 
just a general impression of what things had

13:17.290 --> 13:23.676
changed since we had been there three years 
before. I think you have a unique opportunity to

13:23.696 --> 13:31.082
make that contrast, having been there earlier and 
then coming back this other time. The friend that

13:31.603 --> 13:34.305
you were with, what perspective was he coming 
from? Another professor or student? This was a

13:37.028 --> 13:44.935
Chinese friend, and he was trying to explain the 
situation to me there. and felt quite comfortable

13:45.522 --> 13:53.254
that things were peaceful and would remain so. He 
was amazed at the response among the Chinese

13:54.836 --> 14:12.964
people in general to the student demonstrations 
in that in the past, and I know we were there in

13:54.836 --> 14:12.964
85-86, people were very hesitant to to voice their 
opinions, to let anybody else know how they really

14:14.362 --> 14:17.987
felt about something. Because there have been 
periods in the past, back in 1958, for example, Mao

14:18.028 --> 14:33.170
Zedong decided that it would be all right for 
people to criticize the government in a

14:18.028 --> 14:33.170
constructive way. And this was going to be a change 
in government policy, to allow people to make

14:34.052 --> 14:42.985
comments that would be used then to help improve 
the situation. After about a month and a half of

14:43.775 --> 14:48.601
that, decided that this was not a good idea. And 
retroactively, the people who had voiced their

14:48.621 --> 14:53.046
opinions had been severely punished. So this had 
happened a number of times. And the Chinese people

14:57.271 --> 14:59.454
were well aware of that. So they were very hesitant 
about voicing opinion on anything political. I

15:07.784 --> 15:12.550
even ran into that problem in my classes when I was 
teaching in 85-86. Even though it was politically

15:13.087 --> 15:32.305
acceptable to talk about opening China to the West 
and doing business with the West, the students

15:13.087 --> 15:32.305
were hesitant to act too interested in the things 
that I was talking about, because everyone in

15:13.087 --> 15:32.305
China has a file. And that file follows you your 
whole life. And if something that could in a later

15:35.588 --> 15:42.435
time be construed to be something negative, 
something potentially bad, then because the

15:42.668 --> 16:04.276
government owns all the factories, they own all 
the businesses, they assign you where to live,

15:42.668 --> 16:04.276
they assign you where to work and that, that you can 
be punished just through your work assignments

15:42.668 --> 16:04.276
and that. So students were hesitant to ask 
questions and seemed too interested in what we

16:08.437 --> 16:14.666
were talking about because someone else might 
inform on them. And if the government policy were

16:15.507 --> 16:22.177
to change, that could be held against them. You 
were very aware of this policy of the file

16:22.197 --> 16:28.065
following the student from the earlier time. 
Knowing that and then hearing about the

16:28.926 --> 16:36.317
demonstrations for democracy, how did How did you 
feel about that in terms of, well, how do you think

16:36.803 --> 16:47.438
the students dealt with that, knowing the file was 
following them? Well, I think the students who

16:48.920 --> 17:01.537
were in Tiananmen Square and initiated the 
demonstrations, they were well aware of the

16:48.920 --> 17:01.537
severe punishments that they could expect to 
receive from the government. And I think that most

17:03.938 --> 17:19.655
of the students felt that perhaps that would be the 
only thing that would be done to them, that the

17:03.938 --> 17:19.655
government might send in some troops or some 
secret police and beat them up and arrest them. But

17:20.236 --> 17:30.047
no one really believed that the government would 
use the brutal force that they did in putting down

17:20.236 --> 17:30.047
the demonstration.

17:31.158 --> 17:33.802
This had happened a number of times in the past. I 
remember when I was watching, before I went over

17:33.882 --> 17:42.173
there, I was watching the news coverage of what was 
going on in Tiananmen Square. The news reporters

17:43.534 --> 17:51.245
did not really have a very good understanding or a 
feel for what was going on in China. They knew that

17:51.265 --> 17:52.887
something different was happening. They knew 
that something rather dramatic was happening.

17:55.550 --> 18:00.557
But, for example, every morning the news 
commentators would make the comment that the

18:00.925 --> 18:13.083
students seemed to be very relieved that they'd 
made it through another night and seemed to be much

18:00.925 --> 18:13.083
more relaxed, that during the night they were much 
more nervous. But the news commentators didn't

18:13.144 --> 18:15.687
know why. Well, back in 1976, a similar but a much 
smaller scale demonstration had taken place when

18:16.509 --> 18:25.382
Zhou Enlai had died. And some students had 
gathered in Tiananmen Square to mourn his death.

18:33.469 --> 18:39.798
And after several days, the government decided 
that they did not want the demonstrations going

18:33.469 --> 18:39.798
on. So in the middle of the night, about 1 o'clock in 
the morning, they sent some secret security

18:40.399 --> 18:45.846
police into Tiananmen Square. And they arrested, 
beat severely, and even shot some of the

18:46.748 --> 18:53.958
demonstrators who were there. But cleaned up the 
square real nice so that by the next morning when

18:54.538 --> 18:59.265
everybody went to work, it looked like nothing had 
happened. And it took four or five years for the

19:02.054 --> 19:13.871
word of that to spread throughout China because 
the government owns all the news media sources of

19:02.054 --> 19:13.871
information. People find out about things by word 
of mouth. So the students who were at Tiananmen

19:17.737 --> 19:25.368
Square were well aware of what had happened in the 
past, and that's why they were very concerned

19:17.737 --> 19:25.368
about the nighttime. They figured if the 
government was going to make their move, that they

19:29.182 --> 19:38.212
were going to do that at night, but the news 
commentators did not understand that. It must

19:38.372 --> 19:56.353
have been a little frustrating to watch American 
newscasters make their comments about

19:38.372 --> 19:56.353
something, and like you say, they're not 
understanding the background behind it, coming

19:38.372 --> 19:56.353
from a lack of information or knowledge from being 
inside China. Can we kind of go back to Tiananmen

19:56.941 --> 20:14.257
Square in terms of when you came into Beijing in 
1989, what was your first view or the first time you

19:56.941 --> 20:14.257
saw these students in Tiananmen Square? The first 
chance I got was on Wednesday of that week. The

20:18.221 --> 20:24.467
students had put up the Goddess of Democracy 
statute for Tuesday. tour group was going, or the

20:24.633 --> 20:32.183
conference was going to a meeting near the square, 
and so we drove by the square. So I had a chance to

20:32.904 --> 20:41.555
view it on the bus from Chang'an Avenue, which is 
that main street that runs east to west in Beijing.

20:42.155 --> 20:54.471
And then later that afternoon, after our meetings 
were finished, I went down to Tiananmen Square,

20:42.155 --> 20:54.471
walked around in the square for an hour, and took 
quite a few pictures and was just overwhelmed by

20:54.991 --> 21:16.144
the

20:54.991 --> 21:16.144
people who were involved in the demonstration in 
that it was a much broader demonstration than just

20:54.991 --> 21:16.144
the students. The students were the Catholics. 
And again, our news media focused on the students.

21:20.731 --> 21:23.395
But the vast majority of the people who, and when I 
say the vast majority, we're talking about on a

21:24.033 --> 21:35.712
couple of occasions, there were millions of 
people who were out in the streets demonstrating

21:24.033 --> 21:35.712
to support the students. Of all age groups, I'm 
saying. These were people of all age groups. These

21:39.097 --> 21:46.108
were people from all levels of society within 
Beijing, from workers in the factories to people

21:46.477 --> 21:47.939
in the ministries. May I ask how you would make that 
determination that these were workers or that

21:48.019 --> 21:54.906
these were people of different economic levels? 
In some cases by the banners and that that they had

21:56.088 --> 22:13.547
and you can also tell by the way that a lot of the 
people dressed and the age of course that's you

22:13.932 --> 22:21.085
could see people who were very, very young and also 
people who were very old in their fifties and

22:13.932 --> 22:21.085
sixties. So you had a broad spectrum of society. 
Then on this Wednesday afternoon that you're

22:25.833 --> 22:31.743
talking about, you were on foot walking through 
the square? Yes, I went on foot down there and was

22:31.884 --> 22:36.632
walking through the square and taking Pictures, 
not only of the statue, but of the students' living

22:37.490 --> 22:58.620
conditions there, the tents, the banners and 
that, the signs that they had up, so that when I

22:37.490 --> 22:58.620
could get back, I could have some of my friends 
translate for me what these were. One of them was a

22:58.640 --> 23:07.412
picture of Joy Lai, who many of the Chinese feel 
helped moderate the excesses of Mao during the

23:07.831 --> 23:13.356
Cultural Revolution. If it wasn't for him, things 
would have been much worse. He was a person that

23:15.918 --> 23:25.947
many Chinese feel really had the good of the 
Chinese people in general at heart. And part of the

23:27.348 --> 23:36.876
irony of this whole situation is that Li Peng, one 
of the hardliners and I think one of the major

23:27.348 --> 23:36.876
decision makers sending the troops into 
Tiananmen Square was an adopted son of Zhou Enlai

23:37.447 --> 24:05.698
and I had interpreted when I got back one of the this 
sign had Zhou Enlai's picture and was saying as if

23:37.447 --> 24:05.698
Zhou Enlai was speaking to Li Peng saying that he 
was very disappointed the way Li Peng had turned

23:37.447 --> 24:05.698
out and the things that he had been doing And one of 
the other sides was a little bit more pointed in its

24:06.370 --> 24:22.404
criticism of Li Peng, that had a caricature of Li 
Peng, but underneath it said that the PLA, the

24:06.370 --> 24:22.404
People's Liberation Army, ought to use Li Peng for 
their target practice. You had students here at

24:24.105 --> 24:28.229
A&M who were able to translate those for you? Yes, 
there are students here at A&M and a number of the

24:28.249 --> 24:36.276
other universities here in Texas that are from 
China. As a matter of fact, I think in the U.S. now

24:36.728 --> 24:44.199
there's about 40,000 students from mainland 
China, so there are quite a few. I think that was

24:44.660 --> 24:48.045
neat that you had your camera there to take some 
pictures. You've shared one particular picture

24:48.105 --> 24:55.436
with me that we're looking at right now of the 
goddess of democracy. Can you tell me what got you

24:56.558 --> 25:00.664
to take this particular picture? Well, there 
were... One thing that I saw that was very

25:04.403 --> 25:16.820
different from when we were there before was the 
fact that a lot of the Chinese, particularly the

25:04.403 --> 25:16.820
younger generation, now had cameras, Japanese 
modern cameras. When we were there, the few people

25:16.840 --> 25:22.728
who had cameras were the old box-type cameras that 
you looked in from the top. Yes. And as a part of this

25:25.732 --> 25:33.162
new spirit of openness, there were, quite a few 
people who, I said, were having their friends take

25:34.357 --> 25:43.869
pictures of themselves with the guys from 
Democracy in the background. And there was one

25:44.931 --> 25:49.156
young lady in particular who had gotten all 
dressed up. And they had some barrels that are out

25:49.977 --> 25:56.986
there in the square that were spread around. And 
she got up on one of those. So she was a little bit

25:58.888 --> 26:02.473
above the rest of the crowd. and was flashing the V 
symbol for victory or peace in front of the Goddess

26:02.993 --> 26:13.990
of Democracy. To me, it just kind of captured the 
whole emotion of the movement. Of course, the

26:23.705 --> 26:30.756
students who have those pictures of themselves 
taken in front of the Gaza Democracy, they have to

26:31.141 --> 26:41.953
guard those very carefully because the 
government is trying to get a hold of those to

26:31.141 --> 26:41.953
identify people who participated in the 
demonstration. They're even using the footage

26:42.934 --> 26:51.363
that was shown on American TV to try to identify 
people. So I'm sure that a lot of the people had

26:52.164 --> 26:58.711
their pictures taken. They're very proud of those 
pictures, and hopefully they They've hidden away

27:01.128 --> 27:13.363
somewhere where no one would be able to find them, 
but be able to pull them out at a later date to show

27:01.128 --> 27:13.363
that they participated in the demonstrations and 
that they were down in the square. In effect,

27:14.064 --> 27:22.714
they're proof that they were there, but also a 
testimony could be used against them by the

27:14.064 --> 27:22.714
government, you're saying. Can you share with us 
any, this young lady has on a very colorful outfit.

27:27.342 --> 27:32.848
I think in one of the articles you wrote, you 
commented about how clothing has changed a great

27:27.342 --> 27:32.848
deal. Was that typical of these students? This was 
one of the things that I noticed. When we were

27:39.034 --> 27:50.845
there, the young people and the university 
students in particular, they were rather fashion

27:39.034 --> 27:50.845
conscious and wanted more western dress and more 
colorful things. had a very limited budget and

27:51.297 --> 28:02.751
there wasn't a whole lot of foreign clothing or 
even Chinese made but styled more towards west was

27:51.297 --> 28:02.751
available in 85-86. But in returning this time, 
when we're back there in 85-86, still a large

28:03.472 --> 28:21.034
number of people were wearing the blue and green 
Mao coats with slacks to match and a blue or green

28:03.472 --> 28:21.034
Mao hat. When I went back in 89, there were much 
fewer people. But the only people that were still

28:26.054 --> 28:29.057
wearing that clothes were some of the older 
people. Younger people, students, but also,

28:30.958 --> 28:51.477
again, workers, and even people in their mid-30s 
and 40s were wearing, if not outright colorful

28:30.958 --> 28:51.477
things, at least they were wearing white shirts, 
slacks, more Western type of clothing. So this was

28:51.592 --> 28:58.662
one of the major changes that I saw since we'd been 
there. This particular girl almost has on a

28:58.682 --> 29:01.366
sleeveless dress. Could you share just a little 
bit about what the weather was like? Well, in the

29:04.410 --> 29:06.473
summertime, Beijing is very hot. It's much like 
Houston. It's very hot and very humid. So in the

29:10.018 --> 29:20.873
summertime, the Chinese typically wear things 
that are very lightweight because in the

29:10.018 --> 29:20.873
buildings, there is no air conditioning. so you 
have to dress light. Conversely, in the

29:24.462 --> 29:37.459
wintertime, people literally wear eight, ten 
layers of clothes because there's little or no

29:24.462 --> 29:37.459
heat in the buildings, and the way you keep warm is 
through your layers of clothes. So, as I said, in

29:37.479 --> 29:41.344
the summer, it was warm. It was in the mid-'80s, 
maybe lower-'90s. Beijing, as is true of a lot of

29:45.830 --> 29:50.556
developing nations, They do not have the 
sophistication of ideas about pollution control

29:51.667 --> 29:57.214
and things like that. Most of their electricity 
that comes from burning coal. So they're burning

30:02.040 --> 30:03.663
coal all year round. So you have a fine coal dust 
that's in the air all the time. It kind of makes the

30:08.048 --> 30:12.354
sky a gray. You very seldom see a clear blue sky. 
Even though there was more automobile and bus

30:19.713 --> 30:32.112
traffic this time than there was in 85, 86, there's 
still not anywhere near the automobile traffic

30:19.713 --> 30:32.112
that there is in Western nations. In China mainly 
because people cannot own a car themselves. Some

30:39.302 --> 30:46.914
of the factories and that, they're the ones that 
have the cars, and most of the people still get

30:39.302 --> 30:46.914
around on bicycles. And Beijing is... almost 
surrounded by mountains, so you have all this

30:48.873 --> 31:00.012
stuff gets trapped in there, so the sky quite often 
is just kind of a chalky gray color. These students

31:00.152 --> 31:08.787
were out in this square, some of them at least, for 
six or seven weeks previous to the final week here.

31:09.608 --> 31:14.256
What else did you observe as you were walking 
through the...
