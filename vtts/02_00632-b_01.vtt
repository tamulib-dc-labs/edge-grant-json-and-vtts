WEBVTT

00:01.550 --> 00:10.564
I have listed here a ball breaker signaling 
device.

00:10.584 --> 00:12.527
Well, that was kind of fun. And I must say, as usual, 
these things have a little more implication than

00:12.547 --> 00:18.976
they sound like. That was Art Maxwell and me, I 
think. At any rate, at that time there was a lot of

00:22.141 --> 00:30.814
importance of measuring, taking cores on the 
ocean bottom and taking temperature out. a

00:32.347 --> 00:41.540
gradient in the ocean bottom, which required very 
precise lowering of devices at great depths in the

00:32.347 --> 00:41.540
ocean, temperature probes. And it was important 
to know when you were on bottom. And these were

00:44.144 --> 00:51.334
depths of 4,000 fathom or so, you see, 3,000 
fathom. Well, you've got a lot of cable out.

00:52.515 --> 00:55.500
There's a fairly light instrument on the bottom of 
it. There's really no way to tell when you're on the

00:55.540 --> 00:59.265
bottom of it. So you needed something that told you 
when you hit bottom.

01:06.631 --> 01:10.516
Well, there was quite a lot of possibilities of how 
you did this. And there have certainly been much

01:10.596 --> 01:13.480
more sophisticated devices since. But this, we 
rigged up one real fast. And it was a glass ball with

01:16.505 --> 01:22.773
a hammer and a trip. And when it hit bottom, the 
hammer came down and presumably smashed the glass

01:23.034 --> 01:27.480
ball. and the ocean finding itself unsupported, 
since there's now a hole in the middle of it at 2,000

01:28.000 --> 01:39.834
or 3,000, fathom rushes in, and the noise it makes 
when it meets itself, coming from all sides, is

01:28.000 --> 01:39.834
considerable. There's a lot of power in there. And 
you hear this bang on the surface, but you know

01:42.176 --> 01:45.741
you've hit bottom. Well, it turned out to be much 
more difficult to break these damn glass balls. I

01:49.144 --> 01:50.286
suspected it. Then you'd have a hammer that just 
smashed into pieces on the surface, but under this

01:50.366 --> 01:55.752
pressure, it didn't do anything. It just bounced. 
make a point on the hammer big hammer you know

01:58.004 --> 02:24.501
dropping make a point on the hammer the hammer 
would sometimes go into the ball and seal other

01:58.004 --> 02:24.501
times it would go in knock a shell off and the ball 
would be intact when you came up uh sometimes the

01:58.004 --> 02:24.501
ball would crack all the pieces but not break it 
would all be held together by the pressure well we

01:58.004 --> 02:24.501
finally made the proper kind of point that it 
always always broke the ball but this of course had

01:58.004 --> 02:24.501
led That paper, incidentally, then, and our 
remarks about the difficulty of breaking the ball

02:24.886 --> 02:44.156
have led to the utilization of glass capsules in 
underwater vehicles and spherical capsules in

02:24.886 --> 02:44.156
underwater instruments of all sorts because 
glass obviously requires quite different

02:24.886 --> 02:44.156
properties under these very high pressures. 
Excuse

02:46.219 --> 02:49.404
me. I have high-speed plankton. Sampler in 1958. 
Yeah, that was a kind of fun device. When we were

02:57.485 --> 03:00.671
first starting out, 1958? We designed that much 
earlier than that. That was when the paper came

03:04.157 --> 03:05.840
out, I guess. It came out years later. That was back 
in 1951 or so, or 53 maybe. It was a torpedo-shaped

03:14.650 --> 03:20.236
plankton sampler that could be towed at high speed 
at considerable depth. And it had a neat little

03:20.537 --> 03:27.024
recorder in it that told you how deep it was and how 
much water was passing through it at each depth. It

03:27.044 --> 03:27.805
worked very well.

03:30.849 --> 03:32.150
It was used for quite a few years. I have, in 1966, an 
Isaacs Brown opening-closing trawl. That's just

03:37.456 --> 03:43.223
a modification of the Medwater trawl that allows 
you to open and close it at some depth. Now, the last

03:44.722 --> 03:48.967
two things I would like some elaboration on. 1968, 
a deep sea observational camera system. Well,

03:56.376 --> 03:58.999
over a series of years we developed these cameras. 
They were free fall cameras that you could chuck

03:59.019 --> 04:03.224
over the ship's side. And they went to increasing 
sophistication. We designed them in several

04:09.672 --> 04:11.474
different forms. They went to the bottom. They 
usually had a bait in the foreground somewhere, a

04:15.063 --> 04:23.552
mass of fish or something, and they sat down there 
taking pictures every five minutes or ten

04:15.063 --> 04:23.552
minutes. Sometimes still pictures, sometimes 
movies, motion pictures, and sometimes stereo

04:25.173 --> 04:32.741
motion pictures. We had some interesting stereo 
motion pictures. And we discovered a great deal

04:35.924 --> 04:44.833
about the deep benthic fauna and how it behaved and 
what the distribution of these creatures were,

04:46.788 --> 04:56.842
how they probably searched for the food, and a 
whole different food web, you see, of very active

04:46.788 --> 04:56.842
deep creatures, yes.

05:00.027 --> 05:11.783
I think I'll try to revise that program because 
it's kind of a natural for a cooperation with small

05:00.027 --> 05:11.783
coastal countries because the cameras can be 
operated from unspecialized vehicles. They can

05:12.202 --> 05:20.892
be dropped over the side and sections taken down 
across the shelf and find out what really lives in

05:12.202 --> 05:20.892
these deeps. We find, for instance, along this 
coast that some of the commercial fish of British

05:20.912 --> 05:34.827
Columbia and southern Alaska and Washington, 
probably their main population is down here off

05:20.912 --> 05:34.827
Baja California at great depths. They're 
creatures of the cold, dark waters, and they

05:35.167 --> 05:42.175
merely outcrop up in the Arctic regions or near 
Arctic regions. And that's where the principal

05:43.218 --> 05:45.461
commercial fishery is based. But the population 
itself extends to increasing depths down farther

05:45.982 --> 05:53.272
and farther and closer to the equator. We find a big 
population of great arctic sharks off the Baja

05:53.733 --> 05:58.820
California coast, for example. A shark very much 
like the

06:00.803 --> 06:09.656
Icelandic or Greenland shark. Huge one. Lots of 
shrimp. We'd land deep lobsters. We'd find all

06:16.676 --> 06:20.741
sorts of things. When did you first become 
interested in photography?

06:25.848 --> 06:27.150
You mean in underwater photography? In 
underwater photography and above water

06:27.170 --> 06:29.153
photography. Well, I became much impressed by the 
competency of first-rate cameras to record

06:29.173 --> 06:40.028
things at Bikini, I think. Well, before that. I was 
in charge of the photography of the two A-bomb

06:41.825 --> 06:48.334
shots in 1946. And the fact that these big aerial 
cameras would allow you to place in space and in

06:49.956 --> 07:09.942
position ships and explosive phenomena and so on 
and so forth, I thought was, when they were rigidly

06:49.956 --> 07:09.942
based on land, was a very powerful technique.

07:11.677 --> 07:17.585
I'd used these kinds of cameras in determining the 
motion of an amphibious craft in the surf zone. In

07:18.747 --> 07:30.503
that early work at Berkeley, you see, by mounting 
cameras on shore and aiming them aerial cameras,

07:18.747 --> 07:30.503
big mapping aerial cameras on shore aimed at 
amphibious craft coming through the surf. You

07:31.324 --> 07:36.972
then could position a craft exactly in space 
continuously, see just what its motions were. You

07:37.012 --> 07:39.996
could even, on a big craft, you could even measure 
the bending of the hull. So I was much impressed by

07:41.208 --> 07:48.636
the competency of first class mapping cameras 
used in those kind of modes. And of course, I've

07:50.198 --> 07:56.705
always wanted to see what did the ocean do with a 
dead whale on its bottom? What in the devil does it

07:57.486 --> 07:58.647
do with it? It increases the food supply in square 
miles for years in a dead whale. It must be adapted

08:05.155 --> 08:06.616
to utilize it. And so it turns out it is.

08:14.536 --> 08:19.684
Ravelle tapped me on that one. Because I'd been 
doing this radio-controlled photography. We not

08:25.432 --> 08:38.752
only had two aerial cameras shooting at 
amphibious craft in the surf, but a

08:25.432 --> 08:38.752
radio-controlled camera and a planar blimp up 
above photographing simultaneously with radio

08:25.432 --> 08:38.752
control. She triggered the shots, automatic 
system. And then Revell asked you then to go to

08:44.472 --> 08:50.761
Bikini and mount cameras, which would be in charge 
of the photography. In charge of photography,

08:50.801 --> 08:51.923
right. Of the land-based photography. Well, the 
radio-controlled photography. And did you use

08:58.192 --> 09:01.357
the same techniques there that you had used? 
Essentially, yeah. Did you make any substantial

09:03.581 --> 09:05.563
changes? Oh, well, of course it had to have lots 
more backups and things because there was no going

09:06.084 --> 09:13.956
back and repairing the cameras. And so we built the 
towers, and we designed the backups. And the

09:22.289 --> 09:31.160
backups were, of course, it was uncertain at that 
time what would happen to radio signals at the time

09:22.289 --> 09:31.160
of an atomic explosion. So we had not only a central 
radio triggering

09:31.180 --> 09:43.875
synchronizers for the total cameras, airborne 
and land, but we had back up individual timers on

09:45.745 --> 09:48.188
each camera. So if it failed to get its pulses, it 
asked for another one. And if it got another one and

09:50.971 --> 09:54.976
didn't respond, then it took its own picture 
anyway. And as a matter of fact, that saved our neck

09:55.636 --> 09:59.301
just at the instant of the explosion. That's what 
Ravel said, exactly what happened. He did? Yeah.

10:05.007 --> 10:05.588
When was that? When I interviewed him. He 
suggested that the camera work here was not only

10:06.729 --> 10:14.458
splendid, but it involved innovation which had 
not been done before in camera work. Yeah, yeah,

10:14.478 --> 10:15.159
yeah, yeah. That's right. And so exactly what 
happened? Why did the cameras fail the first time?

10:22.459 --> 10:27.126
Oh, just because of the tremendous electrostatic 
charge that is built up at that instance. You see a

10:27.146 --> 10:32.073
vast amount of static just for that instant shock. 
So we got pictures.

10:35.618 --> 10:37.100
The bomb had gone off underwater. The bottom of the 
fleet was lit up, and the shockwave had not yet

10:37.721 --> 10:42.548
arrived at the surface. And 30 fathom of water. The 
bottom of the fleet is lit, and there's not a pimple

10:45.685 --> 10:50.852
on the surface yet. That's pretty remarkable 
photography.

10:56.961 --> 11:00.646
Now, was it contact here on Bikini Atoll? Is this 
the contact that brings you to Scripps

11:01.006 --> 11:03.229
Institution? This contact with Revelle here? No, 
I don't know. The first time I ever remember

11:06.274 --> 11:10.980
Revelle was an interesting case, as a matter of 
fact. I'd built the first of these sea sleds.

11:14.064 --> 11:14.545
Mm-hmm. And we were at Morro Bay, California. And I 
had built it, and then I was out on the beach, and we

11:18.729 --> 11:23.257
were going to test it for the first time. We had a 
duck, and we had a big spool of rope, just rope,

11:23.277 --> 11:30.188
manila rope. And I had attached this, and I had two 
helpers, two duck drivers. I had attached this

11:35.656 --> 11:37.900
roll, and we had it on a standard. And I said, well, 
we just started in the surf. First time we ever

11:44.321 --> 11:46.043
started a sea sled. And the commandant of the 
little naval base there came down and says,

11:47.285 --> 12:01.064
there's an important young lieutenant at the 
train in San Luis Obispo. You're supposed to go

12:02.085 --> 12:03.247
pick up. I'd never heard of Revell before. So I got 
in the car and went down. and picked up this young,

12:09.723 --> 12:17.531
slender, tall lieutenant and brought him back. 
And we came down on the beach. And here are these two

12:19.553 --> 12:20.694
guys. I told him about this sea sledge taking a line 
through the search. Here are these two guys, 6,000

12:24.638 --> 12:30.044
feet of line, standing out in the ocean. The cable 
spool has pulled off the standards. They've got an

12:33.647 --> 12:38.312
oar shoved through the cable spool. It's plowing 
the sand down towards the beach, you see. So

12:41.972 --> 12:44.415
obviously, they're being pulled into the surf, 
both of them. I grabbed the duck then and ran a wire

12:45.816 --> 12:52.304
out from the winch at the stern of it and got hold of 
it. They hadn't had time to do this. So it was an

12:53.825 --> 12:59.632
interesting first introduction to Ravel and our 
work there. He was immensely impressed by that

12:59.652 --> 13:03.777
damn sea sled, I must say. It's kind of a mysterious 
line going out into the ocean, these two guys. And

13:07.363 --> 13:09.425
of course, I'm obviously shocked and excited. So 
that was my first introduction to him. We then took

13:10.987 --> 13:14.049
him out in the surf in the duck. He'd never been out 
in a DUKW, a wheeled vehicle. Marvelous vehicles.

13:20.235 --> 13:22.417
Marvelous. We never really managed to sink one in 
any reasonable sort of surf. I have a picture of one

13:27.442 --> 13:30.625
with a 28-foot breaker coming up on it. I was in. I 
survived it, obviously. Well, anyway, so that was

13:34.534 --> 13:40.680
my first introduction to Rivelle. Maybe 1945, I 
don't know when it was. He was just organizing what

13:44.144 --> 13:46.947
was going on. Marvelous man. And, well, who 
specifically taps you to do the photography at

13:50.511 --> 13:54.135
Bikini? He does, doesn't he? Rivelle, yeah. He 
does, all right. And then after photography

13:56.778 --> 13:59.441
there, and... I got interested in radioactivity. 
OK. And waves. In fact, that's one of the reasons we

14:04.349 --> 14:08.174
did the photography. It turned out it really was 
necessary to place all the ships in the exact

14:08.194 --> 14:12.120
position. But then, of course, the main purpose 
was the wave theory, what kind of explosive waves

14:13.642 --> 14:22.515
were produced by these sorts of things. And that's 
what we followed then on the bigger shots later,

14:22.535 --> 14:29.185
the waves. What sort of wave did you expect? from 
that. Well, just about what came, what were

14:33.500 --> 14:37.464
produced, yeah. Some people argue that the wave 
would be untold feet high. Well, those were

14:41.908 --> 14:52.117
interesting days when we first shot off the big 
ones out there, because it wasn't a bit clear that

14:41.908 --> 14:52.117
the atoll would necessarily not collapse. And we 
had some of the best world famous, Kishtiakowsky,

14:53.578 --> 15:00.805
the famous soil machination You see, a coral atoll 
is really kind of a barrel full of mud, a thin shell,

15:02.270 --> 15:08.435
a brittle shell. And it's clear that coral atolls 
only exist where there are no earthquakes.

15:15.601 --> 15:17.663
So there was a real question. Was the thing stable 
or not? The bomb itself probably couldn't make a

15:20.385 --> 15:23.808
highly destructive wave. But over the atoll, it 
might in critical depth and deep water. But as part

15:33.134 --> 15:38.664
of the atoll collapsed, then the amount of energy 
they got linked into a wave was gigantic. We surely

15:39.746 --> 15:42.571
didn't know whether that would take place or not. 
And there lies a tale of where we almost evacuated

15:42.591 --> 15:48.381
the Pacific Basin by accident. Someday we'll go 
into that one. Was that the cloud mist that

15:51.707 --> 15:53.250
appeared? No, no. No, no.

16:00.117 --> 16:02.200
I don't know if this tale has ever quite been told. 
This was at Ivy Mike, the first big gauge bomb. And

16:06.867 --> 16:13.957
it was shot off on an island in the north of Bikini, 
northwest of Bikini. Totally obliterated the

16:14.758 --> 16:16.000
island. And at that time, we didn't know whether it 
would produce a huge wave or not. So we set off on a

16:20.267 --> 16:24.433
seamount about 700 fathom deep. We mounted two 
floating wave gauges. And we had the Horizon, one

16:30.188 --> 16:42.323
of our ships, and Walter Monk was there, and Bill 
Bascom was there, and a fellow by the name of

16:30.188 --> 16:42.323
Commander Monk Hendricks.

16:45.106 --> 16:52.095
And we had these two, and we were going to stay with 
them 12 minutes, which was after the bomb went off.

16:53.611 --> 16:56.715
and see if there was going to be a great change in 
water level. And we had a set of signals. And

16:58.037 --> 17:04.205
everything was set up to start the evacuation of 
Pacific Coast cities if we had a big one. Well, the

17:04.225 --> 17:06.968
bomb went off. We stayed there the 12 minutes. The 
cloud was overhead at this time. We'd practiced

17:11.715 --> 17:15.259
getting these skiffs back ashore, aboard. Not our 
moorings, just the skiffs we ran. So we watched

17:17.762 --> 17:22.048
that first H-bomb from skiffs 26 miles away. and 
the open water with the horizon was well away.

17:28.005 --> 17:42.190
Well, we had practiced getting those skiffs back 
aboard and us aboard, and the earliest we could do

17:28.005 --> 17:42.190
it was something like 15 minutes, but with that 
cloud overhead, we got it done in something like

17:28.005 --> 17:42.190
five, you know. Every hand was there pulling. 
Well, we then got in the fallout, We took more

17:48.995 --> 18:04.529
fallout than any fixed point on the Earth's 
surface has ever gotten, because we were conned

17:48.995 --> 18:04.529
into following a path that eventually turned out 
we were following the point of maximum fallout for

17:48.995 --> 18:04.529
something like 17 hours. Anyway, days later, we 
got back to the skiffs and picked them up. One

18:12.297 --> 18:17.061
minute after we left that skiff, one of these 
moorings showed. a record of a 50-foot wave

18:17.750 --> 18:42.087
something had gone wrong with it what had happened 
was the the pressure gauge had not locked into its

18:17.750 --> 18:42.087
position and and had suddenly let loose and slid 
down the cable 50 feet but of course we wouldn't

18:17.750 --> 18:42.087
have known that it went up 50 feet and stayed there 
But if we'd been there and seen the 50-foot wave, we

18:43.417 --> 18:52.789
would have certainly called for the evacuation of 
the Pacific cities of the North Pacific. And the

18:52.809 --> 18:56.153
fiasco would have been absolutely gigantic. 
Scripps' name would have been totally mud. When

18:59.917 --> 19:02.100
did you come to Scripps? Well, I oscillated 
between Scripps and Berkeley for a year or more in

19:02.120 --> 19:09.289
about 1948 or thereabouts. I first applied to 
Scripps in 1936 for a job.

19:18.306 --> 19:18.806
was here. I had been commercial fishing. I had 
gotten a lot of questions about my mind about the

19:21.951 --> 19:27.599
oceans. I asked very puzzling things when I was 
still puzzling. I had written a letter to Scripps

19:36.412 --> 19:40.558
asking why these things were taking place. I got an 
answer which really didn't address the questions

19:41.517 --> 19:46.382
I'd asked. Just like even today, why you get all 
kinds of questions from fishermen and one thing or

19:46.883 --> 19:53.390
another. So I thought, boy, those guys need some 
help down there. But it seems to me, I can't answer

19:57.935 --> 20:02.340
these kinds of questions, so I applied for a job. It 
took me 10 years to get here.

20:09.091 --> 20:14.196
was director then, just freshly director in 1936. 
Did it seem to you as if Scripps' institution

20:16.598 --> 20:23.105
functioned better when it was smaller? Well, it 
depends what you mean by better. It was a hell of a

20:24.466 --> 20:26.308
lot more fun, I guess. In many ways, there was more 
rapport, and there was more of a spirit of

20:26.908 --> 20:32.814
adventure, I think. I was thinking about 
interchange of ideas. I'm shocked that a guy comes

20:34.796 --> 20:38.760
to you and says, how about a troll? You're involved 
with the monk. And did you seem to have more

20:41.968 --> 20:44.651
exchange with your colleagues? Was it 
compartmentalized then? Is it

20:46.493 --> 20:47.594
compartmentalized now? Well,

20:48.335 --> 20:59.947
I think in any oceanographic institution, this 
fundamentally has to be interdisciplinary. And I

20:59.967 --> 21:06.334
think it perpetually tends to crystallize into 
special forms of each of the disciplines again,

20:59.967 --> 21:06.334
you see. There's a perpetual necessity to be 
breaking up. There's a polymerization that goes

21:10.670 --> 21:16.236
on, a crystallization that has to be continuously 
combated. People like to talk to people who are in

21:16.697 --> 21:18.999
their same field. There's no question about it. 
Yet, really, the penetration and understanding

21:21.282 --> 21:30.652
of the universe in general, and the oceans in 
particular, and the planet in particular,

21:21.282 --> 21:30.652
certainly requires communication of all sorts. 
And yet, I think the ideal has to be accumulation

21:37.803 --> 21:49.478
around temporary nuclei that then break up and 
form new associations, and that's a hard thing to

21:37.803 --> 21:49.478
form. A follow-up on this. Now, when Ravel goes to 
Pakistan, don't you go with him? No, I have been

21:56.207 --> 21:57.429
with him. You have been with him to Pakistan. Well, 
that's what I meant on his first trip to Pakistan to

21:59.551 --> 22:02.555
study the soils. Weren't you part of that? Sure.

22:06.400 --> 22:07.742
How would you be involved in that? What was your 
connection with this solization process? Well,

22:13.281 --> 22:17.607
obviously, the salt eventually had its origins in 
the oceans. I mean, as Ravel says, if you want to

22:19.009 --> 22:24.616
understand a planet with oceans, you also have to 
understand a planet without them. That's why you

22:24.636 --> 22:25.998
should study Mars.

22:29.122 --> 22:30.644
Kind of control, huh? One planet with, one planet 
without. That's not very, from that viewpoint,

22:33.389 --> 22:47.735
it's not much of a stretch to say you ought to also 
look at the doabs of West Pakistan, where the

22:33.389 --> 22:47.735
problem is salt. And I had worked some on the salt of 
the Colorado River and various other things. I was

22:51.622 --> 22:53.385
interested in halophytic plants. I think they're 
really a vast potential halophytic plants of this

22:57.689 --> 23:05.301
world, the ones that are perfectly capable, the 
higher plants that are perfectly capable of

22:57.689 --> 23:05.301
living in seawater. Totally unexplored. Almost 
totally unexplored. We have no idea what the total

23:08.846 --> 23:13.674
genetics of all the halophytic plants of this 
world are. Every time we even look at it, we find new

23:14.395 --> 23:17.440
ones. Halophytic avocado, for instance. 
Fortunellas, legumes.

23:24.751 --> 23:25.232
You see. Our crop plants, the crop plants on which 
man depends for his entire existence, strangely

23:26.427 --> 23:38.023
were all developed by prehistoric man. We have 
never developed a crop plant with any

23:39.024 --> 23:44.071
consequence. In historic times, we've made 
improvements, or sort of improvement. But all the

23:49.618 --> 23:56.147
principal tremendous selections of polyploidy 
and everything are made by primitive man. The only

23:58.203 --> 24:02.329
thing we've developed in historic times are 
grapefruit and pustule sprouts. And, you know,

24:02.349 --> 24:04.513
nobody's going to feed the human race on those. So 
the whole curious matter of increasing

24:05.995 --> 24:17.713
salination around the world, the increased need 
for utilization of seawater for agriculture, of

24:18.655 --> 24:20.998
aquaculture and so forth. And this vast array of 
plants, higher plants, that know perfectly well

24:21.479 --> 24:35.038
how to desalinate seawater all by themselves 
using sunlight at high-level energy rather than

24:21.479 --> 24:35.038
the degraded form we can use it in, has really 
received no attention. It's something Texas A&M

24:36.259 --> 24:38.142
ought to get into.

24:43.129 --> 24:48.156
Was this what originally attracted you to your 
work on the Colorado River, or was it vice versa?

24:48.997 --> 24:53.242
Well, I got interested in the Colorado River for a 
very curious reason. I was plotting the total

24:54.043 --> 25:06.699
dissolved solids of the Colorado River one time, 
and several other rivers, including the Indus, as

24:54.043 --> 25:06.699
a function of stream flow, annual stream flow. And 
it turns out that instead of that line of plot of

25:07.640 --> 25:17.873
total dissolved solids per year and total water 
flow per year, extrapolating through the

25:18.697 --> 25:30.393
zero-zero axis, which is, say, zero dissolved 
solids transported at zero flow, it goes through

25:18.697 --> 25:30.393
the dissolved solid axis at rather high level. 
It's an inclined line, which says, in the case of

25:30.713 --> 25:38.984
the Colorado, that at zero flow, it's 
transporting 3,600,000 tons of salt. Well, the

25:39.965 --> 25:46.594
only possible explanation for such a decent 
river, like the Mississippi, goes through the

25:39.965 --> 25:46.594
zero-zero axis. But both the Indus and the 
Colorado do not. The only possible explanation

25:50.292 --> 25:56.300
for this is that there are brine springs feeding 
into the rivers. Brine springs, not salt springs,

25:56.680 --> 26:02.147
but concentrated brines, which are continuously 
flowing. So that as the river goes down a year of low

26:03.629 --> 26:10.978
flow, the slant is higher.

26:12.376 --> 26:15.961
We start hunting for those springs, which we 
assume must exist. And we found none of them in the

26:16.061 --> 26:20.788
hydrological literature at all. We found them in 
the anthropological literature. The Indians

26:24.414 --> 26:28.480
knew about these brine springs flowing into 
Colorado. And the first one we looked for was a

26:28.500 --> 26:38.294
great series of volcano-like structures of pure 
salt with pure saturated brine flowing down into

26:28.500 --> 26:38.294
Colorado. 600,000 tons a year. And I thought, you 
know, the hydrological mythology is the river

26:42.650 --> 26:51.323
supplies you with water that God has determined 
the quality of. That is now your problem. Nobody

26:52.544 --> 26:56.650
ever inquires as to how it got that quality. So now 
here's just this one spring. 600,000 tons is

26:58.493 --> 27:04.922
enough to put 15,000 acres out of existence every 
year by salination. But it's a small flow. Why not

27:06.713 --> 27:16.543
build a little brick retainer and pump the damn 
stuff back up on the mesa or inject it into the

27:06.713 --> 27:16.543
ground and keep it out of the Colorado? Can't get 
anybody interested in that. Reclamation

27:18.826 --> 27:21.008
Department doesn't do that sort of thing. 
Agriculture Department care less. That's not

27:23.110 --> 27:24.852
part of their problem. And so it still flows into 
the Colorado as far as I know.

27:32.160 --> 27:35.303
And there are undoubtedly six more like that. And 
out of curiosity, you think anthropological

27:36.937 --> 27:41.162
sites can locate these? That's how we locate it. 
That's marvelous.

27:46.368 --> 27:59.383
Because the Indians had a real mythology about the 
trek, the salt trek, which was kind of a young

27:46.368 --> 27:59.383
manhood trek to go down in this great canyon and 
climb down these cliffs and gather the salt and

27:46.368 --> 27:59.383
bring it back. And that's all recorded in 1896. 
That's where we found it. We even found the old

28:05.588 --> 28:17.100
ladder that the first man who went down there early 
in this century had built to get down one of these

28:05.588 --> 28:17.100
cliffs, all full of salt drift and crystals of 
salt. What made you decide to check

28:17.121 --> 28:19.663
anthropological literature? Well, it's obvious 
that if you're going to find out what the Indian

28:20.024 --> 28:25.590
names of these damn streams are, they'd surely 
know whether they had salt in them or not.

28:29.198 --> 28:31.061
And, of course, the Indus does the same thing. I 
mean, it's easy. There's a place called Salt

28:32.243 --> 28:34.868
Mountain or Salt Hill. It's by Sargodha. And it 
flows into the Indus. It's salt water.

28:44.465 --> 28:45.748
Anyway, that's only part of it. But it's 
interesting, it seems to me. And it's an

28:49.835 --> 28:52.219
interesting commentary on our bureaucracy.
