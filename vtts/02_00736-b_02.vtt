WEBVTT

00:02.866 --> 00:08.072
Well,

00:02.866 --> 00:08.072
the question is there, who is the thing? That's the 
lumberman. Or the... lumberman's not a good term

00:10.816 --> 00:13.859
anymore. Lumberman's not really descriptive of 
anything anymore. Yeah, really, it's forest

00:17.123 --> 00:19.326
products industries. Yeah, exactly. Is there a 
good term to call the men who are involved in forest

00:21.849 --> 00:25.853
products industries? We used to be able to call 
them lumbermen, but now what could we call them?

00:32.549 --> 00:37.834
It's just the forest industry. $299.

00:52.289 --> 01:01.999
Oh, what I had in mind there is that in the tree 
improvement program, Ernest Curse made a great

01:02.975 --> 01:31.261
contribution in that he sold or helped me to sell 
this tree improvement program, which would have

01:02.975 --> 01:31.261
been difficult to do if I had not had his 
endorsement and personal involvement.

01:31.281 --> 01:32.762
And this is the first time He's been mentioned as 
being important in forestry. Let me get you

01:39.541 --> 01:40.643
something. OK. All right. Now, I have one other 
item, and that is that

01:44.008 --> 02:02.935
in your discussion of the nursery at At Magnolia 
Springs, you just said that it was discontinued,

02:03.320 --> 02:15.839
but there is an important...

02:16.300 --> 02:25.113
I

02:16.300 --> 02:25.113
am searching for a word. Modification? Not a 
modification, an important item, yes. The

02:31.113 --> 02:38.785
seedling production was discontinued, and as a 
nursery per se, there was discontinuation. But

02:39.105 --> 02:59.196
the entire nursery area eventually became a seed 
orchard, which is the most important step or an

02:39.105 --> 02:59.196
extremely important step in the whole tree 
improvement program. First, the first step is to

02:59.581 --> 03:09.276
select the trees from which you want progeny, then 
to produce the progeny on a mass basis. And from

03:09.917 --> 03:27.765
that progeny then, make selections for 
individuals that you want to use for producing

03:09.917 --> 03:27.765
cones from which you will then have a true line to 
produce progeny with those characteristics. And

03:28.015 --> 03:30.517
that is done in the seed orchards. Are you with me? 
Yeah, I'm with you. OK. I know what was done there.

03:38.145 --> 03:45.232
That's the largest seed orchard that the Texas 
Forest Service has today, at Magnolia Springs.

03:45.252 --> 03:57.283
OK. Now, the only thing, and I'm not sure I pointed 
it out in here, the reason that the Magnolia Seeds

03:45.252 --> 03:57.283
nursery went out of business was the decline in 
requests for seedlings? No. discontinuation of

03:58.188 --> 04:13.985
the federal program whereby the soil bank program 
went out of existence and that reduced the demand

03:58.188 --> 04:13.985
naturally then for tree seedlings. I have a 
question. Is that all you have for me? Now, I have a

04:18.550 --> 04:19.611
question. From the point where you came in and 
after having read this about Anderson, and what

04:27.128 --> 04:38.047
went on with Anderson and the movements that were 
taking place shortly before you came in to bust up

04:27.128 --> 04:38.047
the Forest Service. I don't have a transition, and 
it's readily apparent in here, between you and

04:39.148 --> 04:45.760
Anderson. Here is a thing going on in which you have 
a buildup of pressure to break up the Forest

04:46.160 --> 04:51.229
Service. You come in, and I never say another word 
about it after that, because I don't know what

04:51.715 --> 04:55.619
happened. Did it just go away on its own? Yeah, 
nobody ever told me about it. Well, to me, I see two

05:03.809 --> 05:07.633
things happening, or at least I see one thing 
happening. Either Anderson blew up the

05:07.653 --> 05:20.188
importance of this more than it was, whether it was 
a pipe dream that never would have taken place,

05:07.653 --> 05:20.188
or... No, I don't think it was blown up. I'll tell 
you... I got just a little bit of this from Don

05:23.508 --> 05:30.419
Lewis. Only indirectly, not directly. But there 
was always the feeling on the part of Don Lewis, I

05:34.726 --> 05:43.761
felt that, well, the Texas Forest Service was an 
interoperable As

05:44.770 --> 05:57.788
a state

05:44.770 --> 05:57.788
entity. I

05:58.069 --> 06:06.020
didn't pick up that there was any sudden cutoff. 
And I don't think it's necessary to try to put in

06:06.180 --> 06:14.592
there any transition because I can't recall that 
Andy ever told me anything about it. It's just very

06:22.473 --> 06:28.542
strange to me that it seems like in talking to him 
this was so very important that he... He seems to

06:28.983 --> 06:36.794
want to say to me that I stopped it myself by making 
phone calls all over the place. That's implied,

06:37.675 --> 06:39.999
Gary. But I don't know. I don't do. Again, it is 
possible the way things were, that he called

06:45.436 --> 06:53.909
Kurth, and he says he called Kurth, and Kurth 
called Gilchrist, and that was the end of it. I

06:54.750 --> 06:55.952
didn't know. It would be nice to know that. We'll 
never know. Were there any other moves during your

07:00.379 --> 07:04.205
time to bust up the Foreign Service? Serious 
attempts. No. They might have been going on, but I

07:07.730 --> 07:11.776
wasn't. You weren't aware. Always the last. I'm 
sure I missed a lot of things. Kramer said he knew of

07:18.331 --> 07:23.377
some, but evidently didn't get involved in it. He 
just knew about it. Well, you know, Kramer and

07:25.119 --> 07:37.895
Bruce Miles has that quality, too, of

07:25.119 --> 07:37.895
hearing about things that somehow I never heard 
about. I think they used to make it a point trying to

07:44.093 --> 07:45.575
keep up with these things. I didn't. Hell, I 
figured this was the thing to do, and I'll go ahead

07:46.457 --> 07:50.023
and do it. I wouldn't necessarily worry about 
something like that unless, when I start to see the

07:50.483 --> 08:00.379
reports in writing and start seeing them going to 
committees who have the power to make that

07:50.483 --> 08:00.379
decision. This could have happened at that point 
in time when Gilchrist was making those changes in

08:00.419 --> 08:07.571
47 and 48. He could very well have done it. Anything 
later, I don't know. I haven't seen anything in

08:12.636 --> 08:13.877
writing. I see state reports that continue every, 
oh, five or six years. It seems like the state

08:19.686 --> 08:23.792
issues a new report saying we ought to combine 
these agencies. It just goes on and on, ad

08:24.092 --> 08:28.939
infinitum, ad nauseum, and nothing is ever done 
about it. But this, I think, there was a definite

08:28.959 --> 08:31.282
threat. I think so. I think so. Whether Anderson, 
as he said, stopped it or it died at the lack of

08:33.766 --> 08:37.772
momentum. Well, he had some help in... What the 
hell is his name? It's all over the Forest Products

08:41.470 --> 08:43.512
Lab. Oh, yeah. Gene. I should know better than you, 
but after all, I'm almost 80 years old. Yeah, well,

08:53.143 --> 08:57.347
I can't even remember what his name is, but that's, 
listen, I appreciate this. Can you think? Well,

08:59.069 --> 09:04.135
most of it's pretty picky, except for the USL that 
that nursery down there at the Magnolia Springs

09:04.790 --> 09:09.516
and the seed orchards. That needs to be beefed up 
considerably. What's missing in here? Well, as

09:14.242 --> 09:21.711
you pointed out yourself, it's a latter part of 
this that you don't have details in there that you

09:14.242 --> 09:21.711
had in the beginning. I don't know how in the world 
you want to go about getting them. I don't think

09:25.296 --> 09:27.138
I'll get them. And I have to be very careful. I'm 
hesitant to deal with very much about living

09:34.743 --> 09:35.964
people. I can understand that. They have a 
tendency to come back and get you if they don't like

09:38.948 --> 09:41.611
it. And some people will not view this as an 
academic exercise. No. It's personal. Well, if

09:46.716 --> 09:47.998
you're going to publish it. Yeah, then it's no 
longer an academic exercise. And you want to be

09:52.743 --> 09:54.345
right. You want it to be correct. Hopefully, yes. 
And without the information, you hesitate to do

09:57.989 --> 10:04.176
any interpretation. Because you don't have 
enough facts, you may be wrong, completely wrong.

10:10.259 --> 10:20.653
Yeah, I think you're starting to, you would be 
treading on sensitive ground there if you tried to

10:10.259 --> 10:20.653
fill in details. Well, I'm not sure it's possible. 
Because nobody, for one, nobody writes letters

10:22.736 --> 10:26.601
like they used to. And if it's done on the 
telephone, that's sure not recorded. And if it's

10:30.546 --> 10:32.629
done in a meeting, I sure don't have it. So it just 
doesn't exist anymore. I know Kramer did a hell of a

10:34.227 --> 10:40.914
lot more telephoning than I ever did. Well, I had 
the feeling that he purposely at some point

10:40.974 --> 10:48.382
decided he didn't want to leave a lot of 
information around. Although I can't imagine why

10:49.203 --> 10:52.086
on earth he would. I can't imagine that this is not a 
slam to the forest service, but I can imagine what

10:52.367 --> 11:00.696
they're doing that is so earth-shakingly 
important that it bears being classified. Hmm.

11:02.662 --> 11:05.527
They're a good little agency. Well, sir, I 
appreciate this. There are not many people that

11:08.112 --> 11:11.078
would torture themselves in reading that. Well, I 
was interested. As I said, the part that opened my

11:13.502 --> 11:24.703
eyes was your treatment of the dean here and his 
maneuvering, because I had never heard of that

11:13.502 --> 11:24.703
before. Well, it's not earth-shakingly 
important. No, it's just an interesting piece of

11:27.462 --> 11:30.826
information. Bruce liked it. He read it and 
thought it was fairly interesting. He said he

11:33.589 --> 11:37.774
hoped I would get it published because he wanted to 
get enough copies spread around. He wanted his

11:37.794 --> 11:41.619
people to read it, especially the new people 
coming in. Oh, yeah, I think they should. Because I

11:42.920 --> 11:47.526
think it means something, because I'm not sure 
what the challenge is today to them. There are

11:47.546 --> 11:49.628
challenges, I'm sure, within forestry. But I'm 
not sure about the challenges of being, you know,

11:50.182 --> 11:57.433
just outright destroyed at any moment or the 
struggle for a little bit. I mean, it's just such

11:57.453 --> 12:00.518
hard work for me to get somebody. And maybe he 
thought that it would be useful to them to know

12:01.619 --> 12:06.928
that, you know, people went ahead and they 
struggled. You know, you're just in a long

12:07.589 --> 12:10.313
succession of people who went hard. I got some 
satisfaction out of the way that you pointed out in

12:11.274 --> 12:15.801
there that, I did a hell of a lot of groundwork in the 
organization, which Kramer and Miles had been

12:17.266 --> 12:26.176
able to capitalize on. Oh, sure. I think so. I had to 
do a lot of work, which they didn't have to go

12:28.759 --> 12:37.208
through because the whole thing was structurally 
pretty well established. Oh, I think so. I think

12:37.849 --> 12:40.032
they capitalized on it. Well, I certainly 
appreciate it. Well, you're welcome. And I want to

12:42.655 --> 12:44.877
keep at it. well I hope you did publish well I hope so 
too and when I do I'll send you a copy don't forget

12:45.751 --> 13:12.130
where I am there you don't have to call me I've got a 
bunch of loosers around Johnson County as I recall

12:45.751 --> 13:12.130
most of them are out around Rock King and Sandblad 
we live in Pound but I want to buy a new one can I

12:45.751 --> 13:12.130
borrow your key oh We have thousands of these 
things.

13:28.567 --> 13:37.678
This is the index.

13:43.818 --> 13:47.331
They have a lot of shortcomings, too.

14:09.181 --> 14:16.835
Well, I found this when we just proved it raw about 
three years ago. Yes, sir.
