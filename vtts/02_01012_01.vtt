00:08.131 --> 00:15.024
Okay, this is an interview with Louis Pierre 
Phaneuf by Michelle Duran in his home in Kingwood,

00:08.131 --> 00:15.024
Texas, concerning the Vietnam War. In the 
interest of accumulating knowledge about the

00:15.846 --> 00:23.981
war, I am going to donate this tape to the Texas A&M 
Oral History Collection in the University

00:15.846 --> 00:23.981
Archives. Is that all right with you? Yes, that 
will be fine. Okay. Okay, first of all, when and

00:27.115 --> 00:30.621
where were you born, if you don't mind? I was born in 
Lynn, Massachusetts in August of 1944. Okay, what

00:35.591 --> 00:37.815
about your education? Did you go to college before 
you went? No, I went to high school and I had one

00:39.578 --> 00:44.647
semester of college and then I dropped out. So, why 
did you join the military? Okay, well, after I got

00:47.247 --> 00:53.823
out of college, then I went to work for General 
Electric Company. And then because of, at that

00:53.843 --> 01:05.492
time, we still had a draft in place, and it was just 
obvious that I was going to be drafted, so I thought

00:53.843 --> 01:05.492
I'd go into the service of my choice rather than the 
government's. So I chose the United States Air

01:05.945 --> 01:08.288
Force. When did you join? In August of 1964. Okay. 
All right, so what about your training? Where did

01:15.076 --> 01:15.837
you train? Okay, well, everybody at that time in 
the Air Force went to basic training at Likeland

01:16.277 --> 01:23.406
Air Force Base in San Antonio. Then after I got out 
of there, I went to Shepard Air Force Base up at,

01:24.047 --> 01:34.399
where that was. I was up in the Panhandle of Texas, 
and there was a tech school up there for jet engine

01:35.729 --> 01:42.596
maintenance. The reason I chose that was when I was 
working with General Electric, I was working on

01:43.096 --> 01:54.207
military jet engines with General Electric, so I 
thought it would be easy to pursue that within the

01:43.096 --> 01:54.207
Air Force. So I went to a technical school up there 
for that. And after that, I went to a pilot training

01:56.449 --> 02:00.493
base in Big Spring, Texas. So, and when I was over 
there, I was there for about 10 months, and at that

02:05.682 --> 02:16.097
time I just became dissatisfied with that 
particular part of the country, and I wanted to see

02:05.682 --> 02:16.097
more of the world and everything. I chose to 
volunteer for Vietnam and go over there in a

02:16.117 --> 02:22.826
special group. So that's how I ended up over there. 
Before going over there, I went to Florida for

02:28.274 --> 02:32.800
special training. Hi. Okay, so where did you get 
sent in Vietnam? Okay, we were stationed at Cam

02:39.794 --> 02:48.224
Ranh Bay, Vietnam, which is basically in the 
central coastal region of Vietnam. And when I was

02:48.244 --> 02:57.255
in, prior to going over, I went to Florida, like I 
said, with a special train to work with the Army, it

02:57.455 --> 03:09.952
was going to be a Joint Forces Army Air Force Strike 
Command as well, where the Air Force would go with

02:57.455 --> 03:09.952
the Army on certain missions and help provide 
close air support. In other words, it was a

03:10.352 --> 03:20.566
complete change of what I was doing in the Air Force 
to going with this special

03:10.352 --> 03:20.566
group. The ground forces in place? Okay, what did 
you think you were getting yourself into? Did you

03:24.686 --> 03:25.667
have any idea? Oh, yeah. I was pretty much aware of 
what was going to be involved as far as what we were

03:26.788 --> 03:33.494
going to be doing over there. Of course, I don't 
think anybody has a real feeling for what it's

03:34.335 --> 03:40.981
going to be like until you really get there and see 
it. And that's the way it has a real impact on you

03:41.162 --> 03:49.129
once you are there and see just how it can be. So did 
they give you any special training and stuff

03:49.717 --> 03:57.391
before you went, as far as your job and as far as, 
say, the people and the culture went? Yeah, a

03:57.411 --> 04:02.561
little bit of, I mean, we had a lot of special 
training as far as the job, what we'd be doing. Like

04:02.641 --> 04:05.987
I said, that was for six weeks in Florida. We did get 
some books on the culture and how the people were

04:06.862 --> 04:17.676
and what to expect, but not any real elaborate 
training as to what to expect from the people.

04:17.696 --> 04:21.101
Yeah, so you were kind of surprised that you didn't 
know much about what to expect. Right. Any

04:21.321 --> 04:22.443
language training? No, not in our group. We had 
several people that were assigned to our group

04:23.664 --> 04:33.718
that had already been over there and had had, they 
were, you know, proficient in the language. Yeah.

04:33.858 --> 04:34.759
But I didn't have any. Okay, so tell me a little bit 
about what your job was, what your company did.

04:40.168 --> 05:01.135
Okay, it was to go out with the Army when they went 
out on a mission, search and destroy something,

04:40.168 --> 05:01.135
and if they were to come in contact with enemy 
forces, to call in close air support to protect our

04:40.168 --> 05:01.135
troops so that they couldn't be overrun or even 
help. Okay. Did you

05:03.588 --> 05:15.315
ever get in any big major operations? Well, not 
probably what they're following some of the

05:16.598 --> 05:20.727
bigger operations. There was nothing to do with, 
you know, getting what they call a firefighter or

05:21.162 --> 05:32.819
something, being in close contact with enemy 
forces. So did you, you had a gun and you fought

05:32.839 --> 05:35.143
back? Yeah, it was strictly, my role was really a 
defensive type role. In other words, it was there

05:40.831 --> 05:50.325
to, I was not, what you'd say, a true combat 
soldier, much like the Army and Marines, where

05:40.831 --> 05:50.325
mine would just be a defensive to so that we could 
provide close air support for them.

05:57.560 --> 06:03.907
But what we got into a lot of actual combat 
situations with the Army forces. So what kind of

06:04.088 --> 06:06.690
support did you call in? It was F4C, Phantom Jets. 
They could drop bombs around the area on Napalm.

06:15.348 --> 06:41.693
you know to drive off the enemy forces how did you 
decide which one to bring in or did you choose or no

06:15.348 --> 06:41.693
well usually you before you went out they would 
tell you what um we know which squadrons would be

06:15.348 --> 06:41.693
available and where they were in approximately 
the time it would take for them to respond to get to

06:15.348 --> 06:41.693
you depending on how far away from those major 
bases you were operating and uh as far as not

06:15.348 --> 06:41.693
choosing weapons was just bombs, basically. 
Someone had napalm in those squadrons. And they

06:48.069 --> 06:55.857
had what they called cannons, which were, you 
know, like a machine gun type thing. Well, um...

07:06.269 --> 07:10.093
Okay, let's talk about... What was a typical day 
like? I mean, your strategy was search and

07:10.327 --> 07:13.690
destroy. I mean, you went out on missions looking 
for... There was the Army's purpose over there. In

07:19.175 --> 07:26.022
other words, most of the time when we went on 
operation, we would be airlifted by helicopter to

07:19.175 --> 07:26.022
a specific area. A lot of times we would be 
operating with other units. In other words, they

07:29.785 --> 07:38.173
would pick up in a certain area where they felt 
there might be a heavy concentration of enemy

07:29.785 --> 07:38.173
forces and they would be trying to either you know, 
to circle them or to drive them off. And there may be

07:41.811 --> 07:58.633
other units being placed strategically in other 
areas on a, you know, or they would have a big

07:41.811 --> 07:58.633
overall map and they would be placed and try to all 
be coming together, going through a valley, you

07:41.811 --> 07:58.633
know, you'd be on one side, they'd be on the other, 
and trying to come in contact with them. And so once

07:58.853 --> 08:01.697
you make contact with the enemy, That's when we 
were calling them. You know, we tried to identify

08:04.022 --> 08:10.852
where their positions were and calling the air 
strikes on them. Did you ever land in a hot LZ, as

08:10.872 --> 08:13.777
they said? Yeah, there was one time that we 
actually went in a hot LZ. What was it like? Well,

08:19.365 --> 08:26.676
it's, I mean, that's probably, it's just so, you 
know, very scary because you just don't know where

08:19.365 --> 08:26.676
anything's coming from. Yeah. So it's, the whole 
thing is just so much confusing. And we actually

08:29.926 --> 08:44.141
got into a coma situation, and that's the thing 
that struck me the most, was the chaos and the

08:29.926 --> 08:44.141
confusion that's around me, and everything 
happening so quickly. Yeah, okay. Did you ever

08:44.402 --> 08:46.684
have any contact with ARVN?

08:49.227 --> 08:54.853
Yeah, we had several times there would be some ARVN 
troops with us. So what were your feelings about

08:55.053 --> 08:57.356
them? Were they confident? No, I have probably 
real strong negative feelings about them and how

08:59.318 --> 09:05.245
they operated. We were there to do all the work, and 
they would bring them in at times just to be there

09:06.126 --> 09:19.002
for the operations so that they could kind of get 
the publicity and credit for some of the

09:06.126 --> 09:19.002
operations. But I think there was a lot of 
corruption, and that there was The officers, it

09:25.765 --> 09:35.278
was very class-oriented over there that the 
people that had any money in the world to do those

09:25.765 --> 09:35.278
were all the officers. And the soldiers were just 
the poor people of the nation that were just put in

09:36.960 --> 09:44.850
there where they wanted to be alive. Yeah. So were 
there many cases where you and the flight guard

09:45.731 --> 09:49.276
would run? No, we had one situation where we were 
resupplying a on our base, and we were given some

09:54.993 --> 10:03.384
supplies, and this was on what they call C-130s. 
It's a cargo type aircraft, and we had several

10:03.404 --> 10:18.785
trying to get on the planes to get out with us after 
we dropped off the supplies, trying to leave.

10:19.586 --> 10:24.493
And just in general, anything I saw with them, I 
just wasn't impressed with them. They were solely

10:25.115 --> 10:33.331
relying on us and everything that the United 
States would do. They weren't really doing their

10:33.351 --> 10:34.573
fair share. It was their own country. They weren't 
going to do much about it. They weren't any match

10:39.863 --> 10:46.633
for the D.C. or for the NBA regular season? No, not 
in my opinion. But, I mean, we didn't have that much

10:48.716 --> 10:56.466
contact with them on a regular basis, but a few 
times I did see them, but it was not the best we did.

10:56.486 --> 10:58.229
Yeah, okay. What about the Vietnamese people? Did 
you have a lot of contact with them at all? Yeah,

11:01.854 --> 11:08.183
several times you'd go into villages and stuff, 
and that's the thing I think you wonder about most

11:01.854 --> 11:08.183
is that They're just in the middle of it. It would be 
like being here in Kingwood and having troops

11:10.064 --> 11:16.037
coming through at any given time. They're just 
basic villagers and stuff that want to go on with

11:17.320 --> 11:23.995
their daily life. When you went through

11:24.397 --> 11:49.797
these villages,

11:24.397 --> 11:49.797
did

11:24.397 --> 11:49.797
you Did you leave them intact, the group you were 
with, or did you go through it? No, typically we

11:54.239 --> 12:05.154
would just try to clear the area, what they call a 
secure area, for the people that were there. And

12:05.174 --> 12:08.218
not, we weren't involved in any of that. Yeah. Some 
of the stuff you can see right here. Were you aware

12:14.228 --> 12:23.145
of, or in the area that you were in, a lot of times 
during the day the area was secure for the United

12:14.228 --> 12:23.145
States, and at night the D.C. would come through? 
Right, yeah. So did that happen a lot in the area you

12:24.308 --> 12:26.111
were in? That's what we hear. I mean, at times, you 
know, the area would be an unsecured area, and

12:27.394 --> 12:34.127
that's basically what meant that, you know, it 
could be... you know, be fine during the day, in

12:34.647 --> 12:37.611
daylight hours and stuff. And when we went there, 
we'd see what we infiltrated there, you know, just

12:37.771 --> 12:43.358
like we were during the daytime. So there was 
supposedly a lot of that in different areas, too.

12:48.404 --> 12:53.750
So do you think that the basic common village are 
just put up with whatever was there? Right. I think

12:54.531 --> 12:56.273
they tolerated it. It was just a matter of 
survival. I mean, they didn't feel like it was to

12:58.116 --> 13:04.283
their benefit to, you know, resist those via 
comms. organized. Obviously, they resisted the

13:06.014 --> 13:12.826
U.S. and I think that's what led to some of the 
complete destruction of the villages. You know,

13:12.846 --> 13:17.374
they were just trying to get along with it and go 
along with their life. And I think the same thing

13:17.394 --> 13:23.385
would happen to them if they had resisted Vietnam. 
And they would probably just do the same thing,

13:23.720 --> 13:28.709
destroy the village, just totally start it. 
Anyway, as it happened, it was just people that

13:28.729 --> 13:38.827
were just trying to hopefully have those boats 
that people would pass through and they would be

13:28.729 --> 13:38.827
left alone. Yeah, yeah. In the time that you were 
there, were they still trying the pacification

13:39.869 --> 13:45.258
program at all? Were they still doing the win the 
hearts and the minds of the people? Yeah, I guess

13:48.323 --> 13:52.109
there was some of it going on. And I think that's 
where at times they were trying to get the South

13:52.630 --> 14:04.830
Vietnamese out more involved to look, you know, at 
least look like they were. being

14:04.810 --> 14:20.148
active in the war for

14:04.810 --> 14:20.148
their

14:04.810 --> 14:20.148
own country.

14:20.168 --> 14:23.131
What about the leadership that you had? Were they 
qualified? Oh yeah, I feel it. I'm military. Yeah,

14:28.097 --> 14:28.998
I'm military. Oh yeah, I dig it. The groups that I 
was in, where I was being qualified, we had a lot of

14:30.207 --> 14:37.118
specialized training. It was kind of a 
specialized group. So I think everybody felt

14:44.250 --> 14:50.460
confident in the troops that we had when we went on 
an operation. You know, well-prepared, had a lot

14:51.098 --> 14:54.901
of backup. Right. So you, so your group wasn't, you 
didn't get fresh troops 17, 18 years old right out,

14:55.062 --> 15:00.046
right out of base? No. I mean, I was, I guess I was 21 
when I went there. I mean, we had some young people

15:04.410 --> 15:15.420
in it, but once they were, once we were in our group, 
it was, you know, well-trained and

15:04.410 --> 15:15.420
well-organized and, you know, we had a lot of 
support, so. Okay. So there was no problems with, a

15:15.560 --> 15:20.565
lot of times you hear problems about the careerism 
of the officers? just, you know, trying to get

15:20.984 --> 15:25.552
their stamp on their record that they were in 
combat and leave? No, I don't, I mean, I, you know,

15:25.572 --> 15:35.288
we didn't really see that, uh, that, you know, I 
don't feel like there's really anything going on

15:25.572 --> 15:35.288
out there. Okay. Um, what about drugs? Were they 
there? Were they around? Well, yeah, they were. I

15:43.422 --> 15:45.405
guess, um, one thing that, um, Again, because of 
our, I think our group was somewhat specialized in

15:46.043 --> 15:55.011
that there was, nobody would tolerate the use of 
drugs within our group. And I think prior to going

15:55.031 --> 16:07.382
over, everybody that was selected probably was, 
probably had been screened to one way or another

15:55.031 --> 16:07.382
that there wouldn't be any potheads and dopeheads 
in our outfit. And because I think everybody felt

16:07.402 --> 16:15.409
that it was highly important that you couldn't 
have that type of person in our group. Yeah, we

16:16.334 --> 16:23.121
always heard that there was a lot of drugs and stuff 
going on, but it wouldn't have been tolerated in

16:16.334 --> 16:23.121
our group. Anybody that didn't have it or was 
suspected of it would have been sent out of our

16:23.181 --> 16:35.432
group to another group because we just felt it was 
too important to make sure that everybody was

16:23.181 --> 16:35.432
operating like a full bag. Okay. So we didn't have 
any problems with that out there. So do you know

16:43.020 --> 16:45.362
anybody that had fun with the actual drugs? Not 
personally, just other than what you hear and see.

16:50.602 --> 16:52.348
But we didn't have any of it. Okay. Well, since you 
were in the special joint team, how was it

16:53.656 --> 16:57.842
commanded? Was it under Air Force or was it under 
the Army? It was under the Army because it was under

17:00.365 --> 17:11.481
the Air Force Strike Command, but it wasn't under 
operation without us there and support groups. So

17:11.501 --> 17:15.967
you followed the leadership of the Army and did 
what they did. Okay. Okay. You were there until

17:18.113 --> 17:20.536
October of 67, right? Right. Okay. So you were 
there a few months before Tet. Right. Did you see

17:23.819 --> 17:25.682
any of that coming?

17:28.685 --> 17:28.745
No. No. I think everything, you know, you kind of 
operate as a smaller unit and really don't have a

17:28.845 --> 17:40.038
feel for what's going on in the big picture of, you 
know, different parts of the country and such.

17:41.119 --> 17:43.041
Yeah. So when you came back, how was it? How were you 
greeted? How were people treating you then? Well,

17:49.565 --> 17:50.046
it's funny. The day I came back, there was some type 
of protest where people, I don't know, something

17:50.066 --> 17:59.025
with a driver on them, a driver with headlights on, 
protesting. I don't know what the exact protest of

17:59.045 --> 18:02.473
that particular war was. I mean, on that day, it 
was, I mean, it was still a... protesting and a lot,

18:07.304 --> 18:16.134
you know, it hadn't really, um, escalated into, 
you know, this was 1967. I think that was probably

18:16.154 --> 18:29.789
the earlier time the protests were starting to 
escalate and get, you know, really, you know, more

18:16.154 --> 18:29.789
and more involved with students becoming more and 
more involved later on. Um, in general, I mean, it

18:30.209 --> 18:34.594
was just good driving back, you know, just That's 
the one thing that was kind of frustrating, that

18:35.435 --> 18:43.875
you just left, you put in your time, and then you 
left, and nothing over there happened.

18:44.075 --> 18:48.681
accomplished or finalized and just put your time 
in so now you could leave. That was some of the

18:49.602 --> 19:01.037
frustrations, just leaving everything behind 
and the people that you knew and the villages that

18:49.602 --> 19:01.037
you knew. But in the United States, like I say, 
you're just glad to be back. There was no big thing

19:04.962 --> 19:08.867
about it, whether you had been there or not there. I 
guess everybody, everything was kind of low key.

19:12.556 --> 19:16.321
We just didn't talk much about it. Okay. Well, what 
was your opinion then on the years for the duty

19:16.501 --> 19:21.908
commandment? Well, overall, I guess, I felt that 
it helped our troops more than anything. I mean,

19:30.198 --> 19:32.982
the overall, whether it helped the troops or not, 
situation I know, but looking back it probably

19:33.316 --> 19:53.468
didn't have that much of an impact, but I mean as our 
group, I think we helped in helping our own

19:33.316 --> 19:53.468
soldiers to survive and such, but whether or not it 
really had an impact didn't do much for their

19:33.316 --> 19:53.468
country in the war. It probably didn't make much 
difference either way. We just, we had the film,

19:57.197 --> 20:03.231
and I'm just sure it helped support our fighting 
troops. So was your group fluid at all? I mean, did

20:05.617 --> 20:07.120
you receive people? In the middle, I mean, you 
know, did your group go as a group and stay at home,

20:09.209 --> 20:16.057
or were you constantly receiving 
reinforcements? Yeah, well, our group did, our

20:16.077 --> 20:22.505
Air Force group did, and then we would operate with 
other Army troops. At times, you didn't always

20:22.845 --> 20:33.698
operate with the exact same Army forces, so that 
you saw some of the turnover of troops coming in and

20:22.845 --> 20:33.698
going out, you know, when they went on an 
operation. The troops that had been here a long

20:34.319 --> 20:38.563
time, it was obvious. You could tell who had been 
here a while and who was new. But, you know, we as a

20:40.686 --> 20:43.108
whole stayed together. But we operated with 
different, some of the newer groups. So we saw some

20:46.872 --> 20:52.017
of the rotation

20:46.872 --> 20:52.017
of the troops. So was that bad? Not especially so.

21:00.206 --> 21:00.546
Um... So did you ever get involved in any way with 
any anti-war things? No,

21:07.424 --> 21:11.530
no. Did you ever become something? No, no, no. Why 
do you think that's people that did, people that

21:14.054 --> 21:18.320
protested the war? At the time, I was very, you 
know, very hostile, you know, not aggressive

21:18.340 --> 21:25.049
towards anybody. I felt angry towards them and 
everything. But then as I, you know, looking back

21:27.272 --> 21:31.258
and stuff, I think they... probably had just as 
much right and probably maybe even a little more

21:31.238 --> 21:41.991
knowledgeable about what was going on over there 
and obviously You know, they had their own

21:42.680 --> 21:46.645
opinions about it. They didn't feel that it was the 
best war. Yeah. So I don't have any hard feelings

21:50.851 --> 21:53.615
towards them now at all. Well, that's my one thing, 
by the way. She didn't bother me at the time. I mean,

21:58.281 --> 22:03.488
you know, she had her feelings about it and 
expressed her feelings about it. And the war did

22:04.610 --> 22:07.894
end up being just a political, you know, disaster 
over there anyways. I mean, if we really didn't go

22:10.897 --> 22:17.846
in here militarily to do what we were supposed to do 
and had those objectives, I think we could have won

22:10.897 --> 22:17.846
the war. We kept it a free country, but I think, you 
know, people are, I don't know, while you're not, I

22:17.866 --> 22:28.159
guess you're still not truly free people. I don't 
know if they're better off, but at least there's

22:29.360 --> 22:38.252
not a major war going on in the U.S., so you wonder 
maybe they are better off without all that

22:29.360 --> 22:38.252
conflict on a day-to-day basis going on. So did you 
know anybody that was, that they ran to him? No. How

22:45.613 --> 22:46.916
do you know people that did that? Well, again, I 
guess the main thing would be you'd have to know

22:46.936 --> 22:55.937
what their true convictions were if they really 
were just doing it to you. dogs to the draft because

22:56.423 --> 23:03.752
they didn't want to, you know, defend their 
country and stand up for the rights of their

22:56.423 --> 23:03.752
country. You know, I think that they probably 
themselves feel bad about it, but if they really

23:03.772 --> 23:18.229
believed in why they were going, and they didn't 
want to get in that war, but it was because they

23:03.772 --> 23:18.229
didn't feel that that war wasn't right, you know, 
from an overall perspective that, you know, they

23:18.530 --> 23:32.571
probably feel just the same as we do about the way 
I've helped them, you know, for not being drawn

23:18.530 --> 23:32.571
into that thing. And, you know, as long as they're, 
they would have to know what their true

23:32.591 --> 23:40.623
convictions of why they left the country. But I 
don't have any, you know, hard feelings towards

23:40.643 --> 23:45.030
anybody that did it. Everybody had to make their 
own decision to do what they wanted to do. Yeah, I

23:49.327 --> 23:57.221
mean, I think he's the one who has to live with it. He 
probably was just dodging the draft because he

23:57.241 --> 24:05.335
didn't want to get involved and had the money and 
the power to do that. But, I mean, there's plenty of

24:05.355 --> 24:11.305
that going on here and just like I'm sure what's 
going on here. I mean, I think that's what...

24:13.424 --> 24:18.469
Overall, I'm so

24:13.424 --> 24:18.469
weak. On a personal basis, it doesn't matter 
because they're the ones that have to live with it.

24:29.660 --> 24:34.165
I did what I did to feel comfortable with it for the 
reasons that I wanted to. I thought I was helping

24:34.185 --> 24:39.470
those people and able to help our own students. I 
feel good about what I did. Okay. Well, in your

24:43.048 --> 24:48.098
opinion, do you think that we could have won the 
war? Oh, yeah. Militarily, I definitely think we

24:48.398 --> 24:53.067
could have won the war. I got so bogged down in the 
politics of the war. There was a lot of rules and

24:57.400 --> 25:03.347
stuff going on over there that you couldn't do 
this. You couldn't bomb the planes. The North

25:05.650 --> 25:12.137
Vietnamese planes that were on the ground in North 
Vietnam, they had to be fine. You couldn't go into

25:12.158 --> 25:13.279
this area. You couldn't go into that area. So, and I 
mean, when you think of the, I mean, you'd have, as

25:15.001 --> 25:26.935
you study, then you'll see the type of equipment 
and the forces that we have, just with the air

25:15.001 --> 25:26.935
power, all the helicopters,

25:29.851 --> 25:37.763
you know, the technology that we have and these 
people are running, you know, weapons down on, you

25:29.851 --> 25:37.763
know, old bicycles and everything. There's no way 
that they should have been able to win that war. But

25:42.690 --> 25:52.725
militarily, to win that, it probably would have 
caused so much more destruction. And to have

25:52.745 --> 25:58.474
people that didn't have, you know, I don't know how 
to evaluate whether it was or not, but I think, you

25:58.707 --> 26:06.759
know, if it was just a true military war, we 
definitely should have and could have won the war.

26:06.779 --> 26:08.923
So, who do you blame for not letting people and the 
politicians win? Yes. For not letting the

26:09.864 --> 26:11.887
military fight the war? Right, I think they're all 
government people that were looking out for their

26:11.907 --> 26:16.294
best interests. and letting it drag on as long as it 
did. I think that's what finally got all the

26:19.773 --> 26:29.973
students where they got involved and felt that it 
was a useless effort and it shouldn't be

26:19.773 --> 26:29.973
continued. And I think at that point they were 
right. You know, if we weren't going to do it, then

26:32.958 --> 26:39.531
we ought to get out of there, not just let it be a have 
a PMS one, I think, in the late 60s, early 70s, why

26:39.511 --> 27:00.352
they're having so much morale involved with our 
own troops, because there was so much conflict

26:39.511 --> 27:00.352
here about it, and they were going over, you know, 
people don't want to die for something they felt

26:39.511 --> 27:00.352
was a useless cause at that time. That was a lot of, 
you know, 66, when I first went over, so it was, you

27:00.492 --> 27:06.919
know, there was still a lot of people felt it was a 
worthwhile effort to help that country. That was a

27:13.222 --> 27:15.086
real dinner. Helped those people win freedom. So 
was there a time when you thought that maybe What

27:22.222 --> 27:25.226
you were doing wasn't helping the people? Maybe 
you shouldn't have been there? Not while I was in

27:27.770 --> 27:29.172
the service. After, later on, you had some doubts 
that, not so much that you shouldn't have been

27:29.652 --> 27:44.693
there, but that you were used by the government for 
their own use. That you weren't really, couldn't

27:44.874 --> 27:50.862
accomplish what you really tried to do there for. 
You don't want to handle all those second thoughts

27:51.466 --> 27:56.190
that are no longer in the military. So you never 
went through any period where you didn't want to be

27:56.210 --> 28:01.295
there, you didn't, I mean... Right, I mean, not, 
uh, not even for a time because I wanted to do it just

28:01.395 --> 28:08.722
because it was so scary, but, uh, not from, uh... 
Uh, moral or, uh... Right. Yeah. We still have that

28:11.044 --> 28:16.969
conviction that we were there for a good purpose 
and that we were doing something. How do you think

28:18.851 --> 28:20.192
we could have gone to war? What should we have done? 
I would say, I guess, just that we would have had to

28:22.128 --> 28:46.212
have been more forceful in the use of our weapons 
and just could have really, you know, probably

28:22.128 --> 28:46.212
with more direct attacks on North Vietnam

28:22.128 --> 28:46.212
and on their leaders. I just think that had we built 
up even quicker and more rapidly and stronger

28:47.997 --> 29:04.355
earlier in the war, we could have brought that to a 
later finish sooner. So what you were doing, was it

29:04.375 --> 29:07.919
working? Could you see progress? Yeah, I would say 
that what we were there for as a group that I was with

29:15.993 --> 29:20.460
It was to protect our own forces so that they 
couldn't be overrun. And obviously, the fact that

29:20.480 --> 29:24.946
I came back with one on one because we never. So I 
would say that the purpose of our outfit, what we

29:25.768 --> 29:31.797
were doing was successful. And that's why I feel 
good about it because I felt that we accomplished

29:32.518 --> 29:40.930
what we were there for, was to protect us. Like I 
said, it was a defensive, to protect our own

29:41.411 --> 29:44.616
troops. Did you ever lose anybody any time during 
that? Well, yeah, we, I mean, we had casualties,

29:50.326 --> 30:07.609
but then our outfits obviously gone during some 
conflict, so, you know, we just

29:50.326 --> 30:07.609
lost people. Were you ever hit? No, 
unfortunately, as far as, you know, see somebody,

30:08.010 --> 30:12.696
when somebody does die, it's, that's, you see it.

30:18.970 --> 30:27.759
Do you think then that rolling thunder was 
anything that was working, bombing North

30:18.970 --> 30:27.759
Vietnam? Maybe we should have done more, not 
restricted maybe? Yeah, I think more. I think that

30:34.466 --> 30:37.550
would have brought the war home more to them. That 
would have caused some turmoil within their

30:37.570 --> 30:40.873
country. They could get the war over, possibly 
forever, or... about after Tet? A lot of people

30:48.138 --> 30:55.568
have said that maybe if we had hit them right after 
Tet when they were weak, maybe we could have won.

30:56.489 --> 30:57.551
What do you think? I guess that there's probably 
some validity to that. And, you know, we, like I

30:59.994 --> 31:13.834
said, militarily, I think we had the power to do 
pretty much what we wanted to had we used our

30:59.994 --> 31:13.834
forces, you know, stronger in places. were

31:14.287 --> 31:31.587
we not using our technology to our advantage

31:32.815 --> 31:37.823
So in your opinion, do you think we should have been 
there? I mean, we were right, our original way

31:37.843 --> 31:40.627
anyway. I think our original thing was stopping 
the flow of communism and keeping our country free

31:40.687 --> 31:48.438
and letting them be the choice. I mean, we were 
there supposedly as a support group for their

31:48.459 --> 31:55.469
forces to defend themselves. But it slowly turned 
to where they were just letting us do all the

31:56.370 --> 32:01.438
fighting and they wanted us to win the war for them. 
And so I think there was a lot of their own internal

32:04.095 --> 32:15.608
problems that they didn't have the true 
commitment to the war that would have been

32:04.095 --> 32:15.608
required for a country to win its own war. That, 
along with the political thing that our

32:15.628 --> 32:23.136
government was pointing at, was the overall 
reason for our failure. So was there a point when

32:23.196 --> 32:28.422
you saw the tide change and you thought that maybe 
we should have gotten out? I think it was not a, I

32:30.241 --> 32:36.269
don't know, to me it seems a certain point. Because 
you were there, and you just put in your time, and

32:36.289 --> 32:55.556
then you leave, and of course, like I mentioned 
earlier, that's the frustration there, that

32:36.289 --> 32:55.556
you're glad to leave, but you wonder about, you 
have, you know, you wonder about the people that

32:36.289 --> 32:55.556
you've left behind, the villages that you've got 
to go, and, you know, whatever happens to them. So

32:55.577 --> 32:57.379
there's frustration happening. No, I didn't see 
any specific point where I felt it would change. It

33:01.517 --> 33:23.550
was more seeing it as being involved here in the 
United States with the dissension within the

33:01.517 --> 33:23.550
United States, because that built, that would 
have to build that swing that all the people hit,

33:01.517 --> 33:23.550
that by the end of the year, you know, the people 
that had, you know, family and friends and

33:01.517 --> 33:23.550
relatives being killed, and I just felt as if to see 
it continuing on, that it wouldn't, you know, win

33:01.517 --> 33:23.550
cars. And so, to me, I just heard it as a slow, 
gradual, When

33:28.797 --> 33:45.585
you

33:28.797 --> 33:45.585
were there, did you ever get any feelings that you 
weren't, the people back home weren't supporting

33:28.797 --> 33:45.585
you? Were you aware of any of that stuff, any 
anti-war things then? It was still early. Yeah, it

33:49.351 --> 33:50.653
was still early. At that time, I guess I just 
perceived it as those were the people that didn't

33:51.967 --> 33:58.209
want to deal with the military and fight. I mean, 
that's probably how I perceived it at that time.

34:02.203 --> 34:04.069
And it wasn't really as much of a... an anti-war 
movement. Those were people that just didn't want

34:08.363 --> 34:13.911
to go to the law and use that as a front. I'm sure 
there was some of that, but like I said, I don't

34:13.931 --> 34:29.293
really know what the person's true convictions 
are, whether or not they were anti-war or just

34:13.931 --> 34:29.293
against themselves going over there. Okay, we've 
talked a lot in my class about movies and things.

34:34.019 --> 34:41.149
Are there any movies that you've seen in Vietnam 
about Vietnam that are realistic that even come

34:34.019 --> 34:41.149
close to one? Well, I guess in general, some of 
them, all of them that I've seen have some parts

34:41.169 --> 34:53.305
that are pretty realistic and some unrealistic.

34:54.547 --> 34:57.792
So it's hard to say in particular what we've done. 
There were parts in pop films now that I've shot

34:58.513 --> 35:01.697
that were very

35:02.167 --> 35:07.293
realistic. I haven't seen full metal jacks.

35:13.920 --> 35:19.066
I haven't seen full metal jacks, but you can put 
some apocalypse now. There's some parts that are

35:19.767 --> 35:23.391
very realistic in here. And there were some things 
that were We had in the war that a lot of people might

35:25.775 --> 35:31.131
see it and not be able to perceive it as being 
realistic. It was the way you went in and out of the

35:31.151 --> 35:37.911
war so quickly with these helicopters. in 
Desjardins situation and then right away we'd be

35:38.600 --> 35:45.648
back out and back to our main base in Hemero. I 
didn't want to be too long on the compass. I'm

35:48.952 --> 35:57.863
hoping it still was a military base in a war zone, 
but we were withdrawn from the media turmoil quite

35:48.952 --> 35:57.863
quickly. So it was that off and on type thing. Did 
you ever know anybody that, as they say, went

36:03.149 --> 36:07.594
native? Not, not, didn't see that coming.

36:14.737 --> 36:17.121
Um, yeah.

36:28.641 --> 36:34.611
Can you tell us more about, uh, well just, just 
what, what you did, I mean. In your growth, I mean,

36:35.772 --> 36:41.901
you could just spend all, you'd be helicoptered 
into an area. And from there, what do you do? Well,

36:43.484 --> 36:57.325
then you just, before you went out, you wouldn't do 
it with a, you'd have a, you know, they'd bring

36:43.484 --> 36:57.325
everybody in and tell them what the purpose of the 
operation was and how they expected it to go and

36:43.484 --> 36:57.325
what they... What was

36:58.537 --> 37:15.297
available

36:58.537 --> 37:15.297
to us?

37:15.766 --> 37:27.964
to accomplish that, what our units were, what our 
military were operating in the area, what the

37:15.766 --> 37:27.964
overall purpose of that particular operation 
was. And then they would just go out and fly into

37:27.984 --> 37:32.491
this area. And the Army, like I say, they were the 
ones that were actually doing the operation.

37:37.619 --> 37:49.934
They,

37:37.619 --> 37:49.934
you know, helped us through an area that they were 
trying to secure or declare. And what they were,

37:49.954 --> 37:55.981
what the particular purpose of that operation 
was, you know, we would just be with them. And, uh,

37:56.001 --> 37:59.825
he worked many times and we didn't make any contact 
with the army. So it was just, you know, I mean, you

37:59.845 --> 38:04.791
would be out and nothing would basically happen on 
the, you know, all of us. When we did come in contact

38:05.142 --> 38:26.273
with them, that's when we, through radio contact 
with our own air forces, more than strikes at

38:05.142 --> 38:26.273
different areas around us to both cut off the enemy 
from escaping and try to You know, you

38:26.253 --> 38:51.241
would notify the other units that where they were 
operating, sometimes they would be able to come

38:26.253 --> 38:51.241
where they were because of the distance involved 
and brought into a strategic flanking of them, you

38:26.253 --> 38:51.241
know, trying to serve one way or another. So, you 
know, it was just... you know, basic military

38:55.328 --> 38:59.010
operations. The purpose was we would just be 
operating with the Army. And then when we came

39:04.547 --> 39:26.128
under fire, we would be strictly defensive under 
fire, you know, hopefully help hold back the Tide

39:04.547 --> 39:26.128
and the forces with the court and the S-Rates with 
the down route to accomplish

39:04.547 --> 39:26.128
defensive defenses like that. Okay, so how often 
did you run into these? Probably

39:31.217 --> 39:38.765
one out of three or four times. That one would go 
out. Maybe one out of three or four times. Because I

39:43.290 --> 39:52.960
think most of the time that we were pursuing work, 
they were trying to be evasive and they were not one

39:43.290 --> 39:52.960
of them. take us on, take on our groups, because I 
think they most likely are the forces that they

39:54.374 --> 40:01.024
have. So I mean, we would probably try and always be 
after the groups that were the guerrilla-type

40:01.044 --> 40:07.194
warfare in the Viet Cong. We would never pursue the 
North Vietnamese armed regularcy. There was only

40:14.084 --> 40:24.837
one operation of ours that wouldn't fail. I mean, 
in our briefings, we were told that it was going to

40:25.077 --> 40:30.363
be in use. Most of the time, we were after guerrilla 
warfare, you know, re-economy type. And so, I

40:34.588 --> 40:40.716
think they, most of the time, they would try to 
evade us. So, they didn't, it wasn't like you were

40:40.736 --> 40:42.758
put in, you were being directed. conflict with 
them because they were trying to, once they saw the

40:42.738 --> 40:57.997
type of operation, and they could tell just by the 
number of helicopters coming in and all the forces

40:42.738 --> 40:57.997
being put into an area that it was obvious to them 
that we were there trying to get to them. So they

40:58.017 --> 41:00.400
would usually try to evade us. The only time we came 
in conflict with them was when they would be cut off

41:00.420 --> 41:09.471
with the other troops that were being put in and 
they had to fight them. So that's, I'd say it was

41:09.451 --> 41:18.282
probably one out of three to four operations, 
actually getting direct fire from them. How many

41:18.302 --> 41:25.050
would you usually encounter at home? There's 
probably 50 to 100, you know, best guess. Yeah, so

41:27.893 --> 41:34.581
you didn't fight any of the area, it was just, just, 
were the people you were participating in, were

41:27.893 --> 41:34.581
they young? Uh, yeah, they were, yeah. Did you make 
some villagers with guns, or? Oh, yeah, they all

41:39.016 --> 41:41.281
had, yeah. But they, they were big on, you know, 
after you went into an area for the, and sweeped the

41:41.301 --> 41:52.063
area under, and sweeped the area for the body count 
and things. militarily that they were looking

41:52.313 --> 42:05.288
for, that was something they felt was something 
they could report back to the politicians and

41:52.313 --> 42:05.288
everything for their support. So they were all 
young. They all looked real young. What kind of

42:11.816 --> 42:12.777
weapons did they have? Most of them had 
Russian-made weapons, 1847.

42:19.921 --> 42:23.891
the strikes that you called in, were they always 
accurate and on target? Anybody ever miss? Well,

42:25.916 --> 42:33.576
we had a way to call them in and kind of we were 
testing their accuracy so that we would block them

42:25.916 --> 42:33.576
in. given it my area and slowly get it closer to us 
rather than come some, until you felt comfortable

42:33.843 --> 42:55.092
with the, if it was a, with a, you know, a route that 
you had never had supported before, if you really

42:33.843 --> 42:55.092
didn't feel comfortable with it, depending on 
what type of area, where you were, whether it's in a

42:33.843 --> 42:55.092
valley or whatever, you might have even an area 
just kind of tested them to see how accurate they

42:55.645 --> 43:00.694
were. I would have them call in a close one, try to 
find some real close air support if you didn't feel

43:00.714 --> 43:09.288
comfortable in the kitchen. So they were all 
really accurate, and once in a while if they

43:09.308 --> 43:17.422
missed, they missed on the other, in the opposite 
direction. Okay, so how often did the group that

43:21.751 --> 43:34.265
you were with accomplished their goals as far as, 
you know, say one out of every three or four times

43:21.751 --> 43:34.265
you met the enemy did, how many, what was your 
average body count or kill ratio?

43:37.669 --> 43:43.816
Probably,

43:37.669 --> 43:43.816
uh, 10 to 20 people. Oh. If you,

43:43.997 --> 43:48.562
uh, yeah, it'd probably be an average of 10 to 20. 
So, um, But we had, I mean, we were fortunate that we

43:50.843 --> 44:03.637
had a lot of what we call slack time, you know, back 
at a main, at a main base here or there. We'd go back

44:03.877 --> 44:09.543
to a main base and, you know, not have an awful lot to 
do compared to, you know, ground with great tight

44:03.877 --> 44:09.543
combat troops. We may have been out there for days 
on end. They might, you know, we had some pretty

44:11.525 --> 44:18.252
good main bases to pull back to. So were most of your 
operations just on a daily basis, just for the day?

44:29.166 --> 44:33.732
Yeah, they were what they call sweeps, you know, 
sweeps and operations. Was the big base ever

44:33.752 --> 44:37.717
attacked while you were there? Yeah, that, uh, 
Tunchin, which was a side-mounted air base, we

44:37.737 --> 44:41.382
were, uh, had a rocket attack at one time. It was 
quite extensive. It was the first time we'd ever

44:43.144 --> 44:47.850
used rockets that crashed up in Chubb, you know, up 
until I had the border attacks. That was a lot of

44:48.168 --> 45:05.974
good,

44:48.168 --> 45:05.974
a lot of, you know, concern about that because that 
was the first indication that the enemy had been

44:48.168 --> 45:05.974
successful in moving that type of weapon that far 
south all the way down. Like I said, they didn't

45:05.994 --> 45:08.839
have the air support. They didn't fly that stuff, 
and they had the buggy like that stuff down. I mean,

45:13.686 --> 45:14.687
you know, trying to do it at night. I mean, public 
darkness, and obviously, you know, obviously

45:14.707 --> 45:16.470
when they... They

45:16.653 --> 45:41.766
were hoaching the trail and so when, on that 
particular attack, when it was all said and done

45:16.653 --> 45:41.766
and analyzed and that they were hitting us with 
rockets, there was a lot of concern that they would

45:16.653 --> 45:41.766
be an awful, awful successful in their efforts to 
do what they, to move within the country pretty

45:16.653 --> 45:41.766
much at their own will. Was that attack a

45:42.286 --> 45:48.132
surprise? Oh yeah, it was that night. Well, it 
wasn't a surprise. You didn't know it was coming?

45:58.464 --> 45:58.664
Right, no. You know, it was just normal. You know, 
it started when I was in Rockington. I mean, there

46:00.666 --> 46:02.248
were several places that were like that night. It 
was like that night. It hit fairly regularly and

46:03.549 --> 46:04.730
all this. July was the playing days for that one 
time. It hit. The camera, they never got hit while I

46:06.232 --> 46:14.385
was there, particularly when I got hit by camera, 
mainly because of its geographical location. It

46:14.405 --> 46:21.256
was a pretty secure base, it was like, you know, so 
it got stuck out, didn't have very good access. It

46:21.276 --> 46:23.239
was pretty well protected. That's the base that 
President Johnson went to.
