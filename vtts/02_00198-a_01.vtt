WEBVTT

00:03.170 --> 00:05.152
One, two, three, one, two, three, four.

00:05.773 --> 00:06.774
And here I am.

00:06.874 --> 00:09.938
We'll test it again.

00:09.958 --> 00:11.460
This is August the 8th.

00:11.620 --> 00:24.715
We're in the office of the dean of faculties, and I have the honor and pleasure of chatting with Dr. Janice P. Stout, S-T-O-U-T, who is professor of English.

00:25.035 --> 00:26.177
English, yes.

00:26.197 --> 00:29.160
And the fourth dean of faculties.

00:29.680 --> 00:41.843
To introduce yourself, Dr. Stout, to anyone who might listen to this tape or read a transcription, summarize background, family, where I grew up, where I grew up, high school, college.

00:42.344 --> 00:42.645
Wow.

00:42.986 --> 00:44.128
What did mom and dad do?

00:44.529 --> 00:46.452
Good golly, that's a big question.

00:46.472 --> 00:49.478
I was born in Fort Worth, so I'm a native Texan.

00:50.605 --> 00:55.610
My family, I would say, were lower middle class people.

00:57.091 --> 01:10.103
My dad was a school teacher, although he did not go to college until, I think he finished college when I was 10 or 11 years old, first generation college, certainly.

01:11.764 --> 01:13.085
He taught music.

01:13.466 --> 01:15.567
He was an active musician.

01:15.608 --> 01:20.612
He was a member of the original Light Cristo Boys

01:21.183 --> 01:23.647
a band well known in those days.

01:24.950 --> 01:29.478
He was also a symphony musician, however, and was classically trained.

01:30.279 --> 01:32.623
His main instrument was viola.

01:34.086 --> 01:40.778
I'm sorry to say that in the estate sale after they died, I let his viola go.

01:41.416 --> 01:44.920
And it had been custom made for him and had his name in it.

01:46.201 --> 01:48.604
But we make bad decisions sometimes.

01:48.624 --> 01:50.946
Well, what instrument did he play for the Doughboys?

01:51.447 --> 01:51.947
Violin.

01:52.227 --> 01:53.649
So he was a fiddle player then?

01:53.669 --> 01:54.890
He was a fiddle player.

01:54.910 --> 01:55.090
Oh, okay.

01:55.110 --> 02:04.200
He usually played second violin because if you know their style, you know they specialized in the two harmonizing fiddles.

02:04.620 --> 02:10.967
And because he read music and indeed did the arrangements, he could...

02:11.504 --> 02:17.769
play the harmony, whereas someone who didn't read music, and most of them didn't, could pick up a melody.

02:18.430 --> 02:20.352
So, yeah.

02:20.372 --> 02:22.173
I went to, yes.

02:23.795 --> 02:31.722
I went to Polytechnic High School in Fort Worth, which the high school my father had gone to.

02:31.742 --> 02:35.805
I neglected to mention my mother, I'm sorry to say.

02:35.865 --> 02:41.410
She was from East Texas, from a farm family.

02:42.470 --> 02:44.447
She had never been to high school.

02:44.680 --> 02:46.543
gone through I think seventh grade.

02:47.745 --> 02:58.480
So in such a situation it's possible that parents might not have cared much about education but that was not true.

02:58.500 --> 03:05.371
It was a burning desire of hers that I would do what she had not been able to do.

03:05.391 --> 03:12.761
So I graduated from Polytechnic High School having skipped one year along the way.

03:12.842 --> 03:13.843
I graduated

03:14.498 --> 03:16.741
a year ahead of the normal age.

03:20.087 --> 03:20.948
Then to college where?

03:21.789 --> 03:24.153
I started college at North Texas.

03:25.094 --> 03:29.541
Unfortunately, however, I married at the age of 17.

03:30.482 --> 03:31.784
Very foolish thing to do.

03:31.824 --> 03:43.442
And completed only part of my college program before my young husband graduated and we started moving here and there.

03:44.182 --> 03:50.510
having a family, so I didn't finish a bachelor's degree until 1966.

03:50.770 --> 03:53.975
I had graduated from high school in 56.

03:54.996 --> 04:03.567
Finished a bachelor's degree at Lamar Tech in Beaumont in 1966 as the mother of three little boys.

04:06.971 --> 04:09.835
Finished a master's degree in 68.

04:11.384 --> 04:13.914
Where'd you do that?

04:13.934 --> 04:15.139
At Lamar, still.

04:16.725 --> 04:19.656
My husband, and that's where I got the stout name,

04:20.986 --> 04:33.146
I was transferred to Houston and I was able to enter Rice University and as the mother of four by that time and finished my doctorate in 1973.

04:34.267 --> 04:36.190
What was your special area?

04:36.271 --> 04:37.412
American literature.

04:37.473 --> 04:39.456
Dissertation topic?

04:40.838 --> 04:45.846
My dissertation topic was in 19th century American fiction.

04:45.826 --> 05:00.245
a book called, well it became a book, called Sodom's in Eden, The City in American Fiction for 1860.

05:00.425 --> 05:04.350
That may not be the exact title, that's close enough.

05:05.091 --> 05:07.354
Did you join the faculty there?

05:08.836 --> 05:10.618
No.

05:11.729 --> 05:16.276
I've had a very peculiar professional history, which I would never recommend to anyone.

05:18.079 --> 05:23.126
Mr. Stout was transferred here and there with Gulf Oil Company.

05:24.949 --> 05:29.476
He had been transferred to Philadelphia while I was writing my dissertation.

05:30.938 --> 05:38.209
I picked up teaching work at Bryn Mawr College and at Haverford College.

05:38.594 --> 05:40.036
But only part time.

05:40.136 --> 05:47.468
I never imagined myself as being able to go on the job market.

05:48.710 --> 05:49.872
I had these children.

05:49.912 --> 05:52.757
The oldest is severely handicapped.

05:52.777 --> 05:54.579
I never felt I could do that.

05:56.262 --> 06:03.233
And until I came to Texas A&M, I had never been a tenure track faculty member anywhere.

06:03.313 --> 06:06.238
And I was hired here as a tenured associate professor.

06:06.978 --> 06:08.061
All right.

06:08.362 --> 06:10.469
Where were you immediately before coming here?

06:10.489 --> 06:11.493
I was at Rise.

06:11.713 --> 06:15.385
We had been transferred back to the Houston area.

06:16.732 --> 06:25.809
And Rice had picked me up to teach for a year while someone had a Fulbright award, I think, anyway, away from campus.

06:26.811 --> 06:30.398
So I spent like a halftime year or something at Rice.

06:31.220 --> 06:37.812
And as the year was nearing its end and I was feeling so disheartened that

06:37.792 --> 06:45.746
Once again, this delightful experience, as my experience at Bryn Mawry and Haverford had been.

06:45.786 --> 06:48.431
Once again, this was coming to an end.

06:48.471 --> 06:54.241
I talked with someone I knew there and said, what on earth can I do?

06:54.381 --> 07:00.171
And she said, why don't you apply for that job in the graduate office?

07:00.151 --> 07:06.243
And I did, and I was hired, and thus I became an administrator.

07:06.925 --> 07:07.085
At Rice.

07:07.626 --> 07:14.240
And I spent 10 years as, well, my title shifted during that time.

07:14.420 --> 07:18.328
When I left, I was called Director of Graduate Programs at Rice.

07:20.047 --> 07:21.169
I don't remember now.

07:21.470 --> 07:23.333
Maybe it was coordinator when I started.

07:23.413 --> 07:24.295
I'm not sure anyway.

07:24.775 --> 07:27.661
Same job, just different titles.

07:27.681 --> 07:29.564
Did you still teach a course?

07:29.684 --> 07:35.034
And I would teach a course once a year, occasionally twice a year, which was insane.

07:37.618 --> 07:43.168
Not for the money of it, for I wasn't paid anything for doing it more than my regular job.

07:43.148 --> 07:55.103
but because I wanted to and because the vice president whom I reported knew that I could be more effective dealing with faculty if I had faculty status.

07:56.064 --> 08:02.933
And indeed it made all the difference in the world, but I taught with the rank of lecturer.

08:04.054 --> 08:05.416
I published a lot though.

08:06.357 --> 08:09.561
And your publications in general dealt with what?

08:10.503 --> 08:18.132
More with 20th century American fiction than with 19th, even though my dissertation had been 19th.

08:18.192 --> 08:20.194
My first book was published in 76.

08:20.435 --> 08:24.319
It was a rewrite of the dissertation, as you would expect.

08:25.020 --> 08:34.992
And another book was published in 82, and I've published several books since then.

08:35.461 --> 08:38.006
And articles and the usual stuff.

08:40.029 --> 08:50.568
Certainly, if I had not had the publishing record, I would never have escaped the plight of the part-time faculty member.

08:50.649 --> 08:51.731
And it is a plight.

08:53.073 --> 08:56.980
It is, in my view, one of the shames of American higher education.

08:57.736 --> 09:00.800
that we have more and more used people in a part-time way.

09:00.920 --> 09:26.730
And even if we don't mean to use them in the sense of exploiting that bad meaning of the word use, even if we have the best intentions in the world, in most cases, it winds up being a virtual exploitation because it doesn't help a person build long-term.

09:26.710 --> 09:32.216
How did you hear about the vacancy at A&M?

09:32.236 --> 09:40.785
I had actually seen it advertised and I was feeling restless and wanting to look for other opportunities.

09:40.906 --> 09:48.934
It was clear I would never be promoted at Rice and would never have regular faculty status because I'd come in the wrong door and I was their own student.

09:49.035 --> 09:50.436
I mean you just aren't.

09:51.277 --> 09:52.178
But I was not

09:53.187 --> 09:55.292
at all planning to apply here.

09:55.733 --> 10:10.470
And I was phoned one day by a member of the search committee here, search committee for Associate Dean of Liberal Arts, Dr. Ed Portis, who is in our political science department.

10:11.716 --> 10:16.545
He called and said I'd been nominated, and I said I wouldn't be planning to apply.

10:16.585 --> 10:21.694
And I think Ed could charm the socks off of anybody.

10:22.575 --> 10:25.480
By the time we hung up, I said, well, I'll think about it.

10:25.500 --> 10:29.587
And I sent my CV first part of the next week.

10:30.028 --> 10:32.172
And this was the year, what year?

10:33.383 --> 10:46.684
This must have been the spring of 87, I guess, because I came here on November 1st of 1987, and I believe it was spring when I interviewed, so it had to be.

10:46.924 --> 10:55.057
Describe the process of the, there must have been an interview visit or something like that.

10:55.077 --> 10:55.898
Absolutely.

10:56.620 --> 11:01.866
By the way, I had been nominated by a woman dean at another institution.

11:02.087 --> 11:16.344
And I think it was about in the mid-'80s when women began to realize that if they were going to rise in higher education, they were going to have to learn to nominate each other, just as men had always done.

11:17.425 --> 11:22.932
It's the most natural thing in the world that a white male will tend to nominate a white male.

11:22.912 --> 11:24.958
And it's not viciousness.

11:25.239 --> 11:26.463
It's natural.

11:28.068 --> 11:32.382
And people who are already

11:33.475 --> 11:50.241
in underrepresented groups, one reason I think that they have trouble increasing their numbers is that if I'm asked to think of someone for a job, I will naturally think of someone with whom I share characteristics.

11:50.802 --> 11:52.725
So it's very hard to build out of that.

11:53.706 --> 11:55.990
At any rate, interview.

11:57.269 --> 12:11.570
I was invited to come up for an interview, and I drove up from Houston and spent a night over at the Holiday Inn and had the usual kind of day-and-a-half interview schedule.

12:11.590 --> 12:17.959
I will say that I came feeling very dubious that I would ever want to come to Texas A&M.

12:19.081 --> 12:20.443
I'd grown up in Texas.

12:21.945 --> 12:26.331
And I've told this story to others, so I don't mind telling it.

12:27.374 --> 12:39.428
I remembered what it was like to be a female teenager going through the streets of downtown Fort Worth on a day when the Aggies were in town playing football.

12:40.489 --> 12:47.137
And these rowdy young men in uniform coming up trying to make dates with me on the street.

12:47.938 --> 12:50.821
And I didn't have a good impression of this place at all.

12:51.842 --> 12:56.267
And a couple of people I'd known in high school came here when I saw them afterwards.

12:56.467 --> 12:57.948
I didn't have a very good impression.

12:59.890 --> 13:06.496
And so I came feeling very skeptical but thinking, oh, well, I might as well go talk to them, you know.

13:08.919 --> 13:23.352
And I went back feeling absolutely captivated by the sense of energy on this campus, by the sense of enormous possibility

13:24.833 --> 13:31.841
and by the sense that it was a place that was changing in ways that I thought it should change.

13:33.964 --> 13:40.371
And I thought how wonderful it would be to go and help make good changes happen.

13:41.352 --> 13:46.438
Now, in the interview process, did you get the impression that it was fair and that it was open?

13:48.661 --> 13:52.545
Absolutely, yes.

13:54.685 --> 13:59.109
I guess I'd never even put that question to myself in those terms.

13:59.189 --> 14:12.883
So that they were open to someone from another school, from, say, Rice, and the fact that you were female was not a handicap?

14:12.903 --> 14:14.405
No, absolutely not.

14:14.545 --> 14:18.048
Were they deliberately looking for a woman, or were they looking for the best?

14:18.068 --> 14:18.609
Oh, I suspect so.

14:18.629 --> 14:21.992
You think so?

14:22.310 --> 14:26.276
Were there any questions asked that were goofy or inappropriate?

14:26.296 --> 14:27.438
No, I don't think so.

14:28.319 --> 14:39.918
The dean at that time, Dan Fallon, had not been here very long, maybe a couple of years, had of course come from elsewhere, and he had big ideas for liberal arts.

14:40.959 --> 14:49.853
He was putting together, I believe, a considerably larger associate dean staff than there had been before.

14:49.833 --> 14:51.495
He wanted variety.

14:51.535 --> 15:06.037
He had people who had been here a very long time who were on that dean's staff, but he wanted a variety of insights and ways of looking at the world, and I suspect that he deliberately wanted a woman.

15:06.698 --> 15:12.826
How long was it between your interview and the time you heard a result of it?

15:13.588 --> 15:15.250
In this case, I guess there was an offer.

15:17.643 --> 15:22.631
Well, I think it was only a couple of, oh, you're asking me to go back a long way.

15:23.212 --> 15:26.477
I think it was only a couple or three weeks before I heard by phone.

15:27.479 --> 15:33.829
But it was several months before I had a formal written offer.

15:34.703 --> 15:42.375
I had made it clear, but not until someone asked me, that I would not move unless my spouse moved.

15:43.476 --> 15:45.760
This was no longer Mr. Stout, by the way.

15:45.800 --> 15:48.985
This was a fellow academic.

15:50.908 --> 16:00.222
And when I was here for the interview, someone, I guess it was the search committee chair, said, by the way, do you have a family?

16:00.573 --> 16:02.816
And that was when I made this clear.

16:03.638 --> 16:06.041
So they had asked for his CV.

16:06.662 --> 16:12.331
And it takes more doing to work out two appointments.

16:12.572 --> 16:17.439
But we were, I suppose, one of the earlier of the partner placements here.

16:17.479 --> 16:25.872
And my husband has been quite cheerful in telling people that he was a spousal placement.

16:25.892 --> 16:27.014
And what department did he in?

16:27.034 --> 16:27.555
He's in civil engineering.

16:27.595 --> 16:28.977
Civil engineering.

16:29.615 --> 16:31.579
And he was at Rice at that time?

16:31.599 --> 16:35.928
He had been at Rice for 20 years, ever since graduate school.

16:37.190 --> 16:38.834
He was kind of ready for a change, too.

16:39.816 --> 16:40.277
All right.

16:40.557 --> 16:43.844
When you got the letter, this is the only dollar question I'll ask.

16:43.964 --> 16:45.447
What was the beginning salary?

16:49.207 --> 16:51.153
I think it was $50,000.

16:51.414 --> 16:54.643
It may have been $54,000.

16:55.064 --> 17:02.085
Did that seem to you to be an appropriate salary in the real world at that time?

17:03.398 --> 17:05.941
Oh, yeah, and I was very pleased.

17:06.021 --> 17:09.746
I mean, I was making a paltry sum at Rice.

17:09.766 --> 17:12.489
This was a significant increase for me.

17:13.390 --> 17:21.640
I did later find out that I was paid the least of any of the associate deans in the college, and I was always paid the least.

17:23.403 --> 17:24.744
Now, you said in the college.

17:24.804 --> 17:25.425
In the college.

17:25.445 --> 17:26.246
You mean of liberal arts.

17:26.266 --> 17:26.526
Right.

17:26.887 --> 17:28.389
How many other associate deans were there?

17:28.409 --> 17:29.490
There were three others.

17:30.230 --> 17:33.596
And I never checked what people were paid in the other colleges.

17:37.101 --> 17:48.360
But Dean Fallon was quite aware that, in a sense, he had rescued me from an undesirable professional situation.

17:49.702 --> 17:52.928
And he knew I was grateful.

17:52.988 --> 17:56.153
I'm not saying that he deliberately

17:57.517 --> 18:03.688
But those considerations weigh into it when you think about someone's salary.

18:05.952 --> 18:09.097
Describe the move up here and y'all getting settled in.

18:09.518 --> 18:09.918
Righto.

18:10.039 --> 18:13.605
We came after I had the formal offer.

18:13.685 --> 18:16.610
We came up on a weekend.

18:16.650 --> 18:22.360
We had an appointment with a realtor whose name had been given to me by the college.

18:23.335 --> 18:50.710
uh she drove us around to show us neighborhoods and i think she imagined that was all we wanted to do and we said we expected to look at houses so she took us into three or four houses that day we went home feeling pretty strongly that we wanted to buy the house that we in fact live in today but we would not let ourselves do it until we came back for another weekend and

18:50.690 --> 18:55.782
try to cool off on it, and then thinking we've been very happy the whole time.

18:56.142 --> 19:01.695
And I presume, by comparison with Houston prices, things here seemed a little bit lower.

19:02.249 --> 19:04.613
Yes, things did seem a little bit lower.

19:05.094 --> 19:10.945
And there was not enormous choice, but there was certainly sufficient choice for us.

19:12.067 --> 19:12.768
All right.

19:12.828 --> 19:24.369
Now, as you moved and began your task, how easy was it to become part of the greater A&M faculty family?

19:24.610 --> 19:24.730
Right.

19:24.710 --> 19:33.007
I think the English department always was, at first, was a little uncertain about me.

19:33.067 --> 19:40.221
They had obviously voted to hire me and voted to give me tenure, but the impetus had come from the dean.

19:40.201 --> 19:45.849
And so I was always sort of part of the department and yet not part of the department.

19:46.650 --> 19:52.738
I was hired as a tenured associate professor with the promise that I would come up for full the next year.

19:52.758 --> 19:59.307
And I did come up for full the next year and was promoted.

19:59.658 --> 20:00.721
from the word go.

20:01.342 --> 20:09.041
Dan Fallon sort of preferred that his associate deans not teach, but I said that's who I am.

20:09.081 --> 20:09.963
I'm on your side.

20:11.727 --> 20:17.481
See, if I could be the emperor, I would require that everybody teach at least one course a year.

20:17.461 --> 20:19.784
It keeps them in touch with the reality.

20:19.844 --> 20:20.966
With the real work.

20:21.507 --> 20:21.587
Yes.

20:21.607 --> 20:25.532
The real work of a university is teaching and scholarship.

20:25.933 --> 20:36.007
And I realized that at some point, you get to a place where it is counterproductive to be going and teaching.

20:36.148 --> 20:39.693
And in fact, I have not been in the classroom since I've been dean of faculty.

20:40.394 --> 20:45.561
But I have continued to publish and continued to work with graduate students.

20:45.541 --> 20:48.165
But I was in the undergraduate classroom then.

20:49.246 --> 20:51.329
It was, of course, very difficult.

20:52.270 --> 20:54.153
Very different is what I meant to say.

20:54.213 --> 20:58.419
I guess that's one of those Freudian things, because I said difficult.

21:00.202 --> 21:03.166
It was very different from being at Rice because of the scale.

21:04.227 --> 21:11.177
In the College of Liberal Arts, we had more faculty members than Rice had as a university.

21:12.777 --> 21:16.502
And I had not done faculty affairs before.

21:16.522 --> 21:18.745
I'd done graduate program affairs.

21:19.286 --> 21:25.595
Here I was charged with working on our graduate programs and on faculty affairs.

21:25.675 --> 21:27.097
I did that from day one.

21:27.177 --> 21:29.099
What did faculty affairs, what did that mean?

21:29.660 --> 21:33.165
All the kinds of things that the dean of faculties does.

21:33.145 --> 21:47.708
at Texas A&M, I did in a college sense, except that the dean personally dealt with hiring and salary questions.

21:48.108 --> 21:52.796
So I wasn't much involved in those, gradually more as years went by.

21:52.836 --> 21:56.722
And where were we all housed at that point?

21:56.742 --> 22:00.047
We were in Harrington Tower on the eighth floor.

22:00.989 --> 22:09.198
I think education always felt that we were the interlopers there because that was supposed to be their building, but that's where we were at any rate.

22:09.918 --> 22:20.670
And describe the typical routine that you, what happened on what day for the associate dean?

22:22.912 --> 22:28.498
We had a staff meeting with the dean once a week that would last for a couple of hours.

22:28.558 --> 22:30.540
Apart from that,

22:30.520 --> 22:33.184
My schedule was very free-form.

22:34.225 --> 22:36.268
I was always there by 8 o'clock.

22:38.251 --> 22:40.855
If I ever left by 5, I don't remember it.

22:42.838 --> 22:55.997
Subsequently, when I was stepping down, a faculty member stopped me on the sidewalk one day and said, I'm thinking about being a candidate for associate dean, but is it really true you have to be there 9 to 5?

22:56.898 --> 22:58.941
And I said, no, that is not true.

22:59.528 --> 23:05.925
at all, you need to be there by 7.30 or 8 at the latest, and you will never leave by 5.

23:06.426 --> 23:10.115
I believe he was not a candidate.

23:10.536 --> 23:12.401
An enormous paper flow.

23:15.650 --> 23:16.592
We had

23:18.361 --> 23:22.649
fairly defined roles, but we shared a lot.

23:22.950 --> 23:38.580
So the issues in which an associate dean might become involved varied considerably, and that's wonderful for learning things, although it's not too great for efficiency.

23:39.303 --> 23:42.669
I forget where I was going.

23:42.849 --> 23:48.018
Give examples of some of the difficult matters you all had to deal with.

23:48.378 --> 23:54.128
Well, of course, we had our component, our fair component of complaint cases.

23:54.568 --> 23:55.370
From faculty?

23:55.510 --> 24:00.799
From faculty or against faculty, and I would get involved with those either way.

24:00.819 --> 24:02.762
And these would have included such topics as what?

24:03.417 --> 24:23.788
Oh, complaint cases in the sense that my department head is not being fair to me, my faculty colleague is not treating me with appropriate collegiality, and I would try to do informal mediation.

24:24.528 --> 24:42.705
I had been told even before I accepted the job that the dean wanted me to work on sexual harassment issues if those ever arose and to try to work proactively on educating our community about that issue.

24:42.685 --> 24:51.679
It was, of course, then gaining legal status under EEOC quite aggressively.

24:52.660 --> 25:07.403
The first case like that that I had to work on was with a very senior person, and it was a challenge being new kid on the block and dealing with that, but I hope I dealt with it appropriately.

25:07.463 --> 25:08.625
I tried to do so.

25:08.605 --> 25:13.992
Could it be, could you talk in general about the kind of issues involved in a case like that?

25:15.271 --> 25:24.687
In a typical sexual harassment complaint, we have a lot of disguising of motivations going on.

25:25.348 --> 25:30.157
People are usually unwilling to face what they have done.

25:30.217 --> 25:40.114
People are usually not willing to face the fact that what we are talking about is not so much

25:40.094 --> 25:46.488
shall we say, immorality in a traditional sense as we are talking about abuse of power.

25:48.051 --> 25:56.088
And I think if you switch it to the abuse of power terms and can clarify that, then you can make some headway.

25:56.709 --> 26:00.297
In general, the allegations came from what kind of a student?

26:00.563 --> 26:04.648
A graduate student in this case.

26:06.990 --> 26:12.897
Graduate students are statistically at greatest risk of sexual harassment, as you may know.

26:12.957 --> 26:15.220
I mean, national study after national study.

26:15.420 --> 26:16.801
They were the accused.

26:17.382 --> 26:18.243
The accusing.

26:18.343 --> 26:19.044
Oh, accusing.

26:19.184 --> 26:20.105
Okay.

26:20.145 --> 26:24.310
Graduate students, of course, are in a position of dual jeopardy.

26:24.290 --> 26:28.314
And male accusing male or what?

26:28.554 --> 26:35.761
Female accusing male is overwhelmingly the typical case, and that is true nationally as it is here.

26:35.821 --> 26:54.178
And faculty members are always very quick to say, oh, but what about the false accusation, which would obviously be devastating and which can happen.

26:54.158 --> 27:03.872
But which is very rare, whereas unfortunately, the actual case is not all that rare.

27:04.933 --> 27:06.616
Thank heaven it doesn't happen every day.

27:06.636 --> 27:07.497
I don't mean that.

27:07.837 --> 27:21.617
But the false accusation, I have only had in my years here one case where I was quite certain I was dealing with a false accusation.

27:21.597 --> 27:29.266
And this student was demonstrably ill.

27:29.286 --> 27:43.622
And in terms of the seriousness, did, were any of these serious enough to lead to potential termination of the accused?

27:44.041 --> 27:53.053
I dealt with one case where the person was found guilty of sexual harassment.

27:53.674 --> 28:05.491
The president's letter, and in those days, the president was required to write the letter under our policies, said, if you are ever again accused and found guilty, you will be terminated.

28:06.071 --> 28:12.360
And this was, I mean, this is awful to have to deal with, yeah.

28:12.425 --> 28:19.956
As the associate dean, were you the one to do the investigation, or was there usually a committee doing it for you?

28:19.996 --> 28:28.989
There was usually a committee, and that would bring a recommendation to me, and I would then have to add my recommendation to it.

28:29.389 --> 28:35.698
Normally, did you find it appropriate to agree with the committee's recommendation?

28:36.522 --> 28:39.227
Do you know, I think I've just told you the wrong thing.

28:40.490 --> 28:44.458
Our policy now requires it that way.

28:45.179 --> 28:47.203
But I think I was reading backwards.

28:47.624 --> 28:53.957
I believe at that time those things would get charged to me, and I did the investigation.

28:55.459 --> 28:56.742
So I take that back.

28:57.852 --> 29:01.896
But then, yes, I had to make a recommendation.

29:02.317 --> 29:12.287
And the person who was censured by the president that I mentioned earlier, I believe never forgave me for that.

29:13.248 --> 29:16.091
But in fact, this person was accused again.

29:17.492 --> 29:19.354
And I had to investigate again.

29:19.374 --> 29:26.762
And that second one, if I had come in with a recommendation of guilty,

29:27.991 --> 29:30.995
he would probably have been fired.

29:31.015 --> 29:35.160
But I really believed in the second case that there was a misunderstanding.

29:36.021 --> 29:41.647
Did you ever get any midnight phone calls, any harassment phone calls?

29:41.727 --> 29:42.028
Never.

29:43.429 --> 29:44.010
Never have.

29:44.130 --> 29:45.111
Never have, okay.

29:45.131 --> 29:46.293
No threats?

29:46.313 --> 29:46.513
No.

29:46.834 --> 29:56.445
Did anyone in any real or self-selected position of authority

29:56.425 --> 30:00.088
ever tell you what decision to reach in advance?

30:00.949 --> 30:01.269
Never.

30:01.630 --> 30:03.011
Never, no one ever tried to.

30:03.031 --> 30:14.461
And in terms of your total workload, about what percentage of time was required for this kind of matter?

30:14.861 --> 30:24.610
Oh, in terms of worry and care and grief, of course enormous, but in terms of time,

30:25.147 --> 30:27.412
Oh, my word, never more than 5%.

30:27.452 --> 30:28.715
I would say less than that.

30:28.815 --> 30:30.860
What did you spend most of your time on?

30:32.162 --> 30:39.679
Routine paper flow, plucking forth from the flow the things that needed attention.

30:40.418 --> 30:42.723
Attending meetings, I'm sorry to say.

30:42.763 --> 30:58.815
Because I wanted to and felt it was important, I spent time tracking the representation of women and minorities in the college.

30:58.795 --> 31:03.601
and comparative salaries in the college.

31:04.362 --> 31:06.245
This is not something I had to do.

31:06.285 --> 31:12.953
The dean always allowed me a lot of latitude on what I thought I should do, and I thought I should do that.

31:13.214 --> 31:20.483
What were your findings where people of similar background and experience were compared?

31:20.724 --> 31:22.346
All right, women are always paid less.

31:22.786 --> 31:24.128
They were and they are.
