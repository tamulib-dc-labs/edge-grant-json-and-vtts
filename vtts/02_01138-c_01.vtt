WEBVTT

00:02.562 --> 00:10.614
That was nothing more than what we need to eat with 
sourdough biscuits or sourdough bread. And so

00:11.115 --> 00:13.178
often they say they won't rise. The main thing is 
with the generation today, fast, hurry up, get on

00:13.778 --> 00:20.268
the ground, get going. And you don't rush 
sourdough bread. There's no rushing to it. And you

00:27.298 --> 00:29.802
look at it, I put that up the second time and that's 
something else. I work mine down. I put it up and

00:36.906 --> 00:39.652
then I work it down and let it rise. And I didn't get 
it worked down. And I said, it just will get done by

00:45.577 --> 00:48.581
12 o'clock. Well, it's 11.56, so I missed it for a 
minute. Oh, my gosh. But I want you to come over here

00:53.867 --> 01:02.598
before the oven gets hot, and I'll show you why I 
mean when I tell you that you can't brush it. Now,

01:02.618 --> 01:07.183
here's one that's at the same time, and it's 
sitting out here. And I put this in here for you.

01:15.513 --> 01:17.416
I know you do. I know you're such a diva. That's 
incredible. They're tripled inside. That's just

01:23.405 --> 01:30.095
to show you, to show the average person the 
difference. What it means to keep it secluded from

01:30.115 --> 01:31.256
the air. To make it right. This thing doesn't own 
anything. But I just put it in there to keep it

01:36.785 --> 01:41.171
airtight, airtight. Away from you. Patience, 
patience. Patience. And that's what old folks,

01:44.231 --> 01:47.695
they'd cook on the fireplace. And they didn't cook 
with a blaze. They'd cook with coals and ashes.

01:56.287 --> 01:59.972
The modern girl today has got to have a flame. She's 
got to see it rolling. And you burn up everything

02:02.035 --> 02:05.240
you have. And I don't think they cook it very much 
anymore. Really? I'll bet. Well, there isn't

02:13.377 --> 02:22.591
anybody there that can cook. I don't have any green 
myra, but I'll give it a blast. You'll let them come

02:25.896 --> 02:28.680
in. OK. What do you think about the now, though? 
Well. And the curtains are great. That's a

02:35.075 --> 02:36.759
beautiful room. That is. That little diamond in 
that couldn't make sense. And let me tell you, if I

02:40.185 --> 02:47.179
had my pillows to go on that other bed, it matches up 
too pretty well. It is beautiful. It's not so

02:48.581 --> 02:54.673
pretty, but that was made in 1930.

02:55.210 --> 03:00.836
Oh, listen, I have a question about, you know, the 
quilts I photographed. You have all those in a

03:00.856 --> 03:03.618
good, safe place, don't you? Oh, heavens, 
somebody stole three of them, honey, before.

03:08.183 --> 03:08.743
What? Yeah. Where? Three of those quilts have been 
stolen long ago. Which ones? One was that pretty

03:13.808 --> 03:17.772
one with the purple. You're kidding. No, I'm not. 
Well, shoot, everybody in town knew it. My house

03:23.511 --> 03:24.953
was robbed, honey. I was robbed of everything 
nearly I had. They didn't take valuables like the

03:27.637 --> 03:33.043
canister set and that sugar bowl. They took your 
quilts? They took three quilts, honey, that I

03:34.225 --> 03:39.511
wouldn't have parted with. Well, then I've got the 
only photographs of those. That's right. But I'm

03:42.015 --> 03:43.496
going to have those done in posters. You better do 
something because I don't have them anymore.

03:48.299 --> 03:52.384
Well, so much has happened to me this year that I 
didn't realize you had lost anything. But we'll

03:52.745 --> 03:53.746
just have to do some more. Oh, yeah, they came in. 
Oh, I've got some. That had to be somebody you knew.

03:57.431 --> 04:00.595
Oh, sure, it was somebody that knew that I had 
these. Sure, it was somebody. But who? That's the

04:02.617 --> 04:03.719
whole thing. Well, honey, the man that started 
this house went down at the ranch. and stole a bunch

04:08.701 --> 04:10.204
of things. Oh, Ava, but those were going to be 
exhibited. That's what I wanted to do with them.

04:14.393 --> 04:15.675
Okay, but there's nothing. And he was in need of 
money, and I'm sure he's the one who stole them. But

04:20.405 --> 04:22.449
I've got quilt tops. That's similar. Okay, okay. 
So we can... Get along with that, I hope. Well,

04:28.616 --> 04:29.558
sure. Okay. Because I'm going to work on trying to 
get the... The Smithsonian wants the quilts

04:32.562 --> 04:37.309
eventually, if you're willing to quilt them. And 
either that or I have a big surprise for you, which I

04:39.292 --> 04:44.800
really think is very important. They've just 
appropriated the funding in Austin to build a

04:44.780 --> 04:53.484
multi-million dollar museum complex for history 
and art of the Southwest. It's going to be in

04:54.085 --> 04:57.996
Austin, and my goal is to be ready for them. a little 
okay so we've got all of your history can be a

04:58.432 --> 05:21.722
participant in this um okay well ladybird i gave 
lennon and ladybird a quilt when i married when

04:58.432 --> 05:21.722
they married i would like to uh photograph that if i 
could star quilt is it okay it's made of you know

04:58.432 --> 05:21.722
back in 37 times were so hard and i just made it to 
different pieces that I had not all the same kind

05:21.702 --> 05:46.630
like I took the pleasure of pains of doing right 
this and the other day when she was entertaining

05:21.702 --> 05:46.630
the dignitaries from Washington this last week 
out in the hangar she hung it up on the wall oh how

05:21.702 --> 05:46.630
marvelous and told them where it came from 
wonderful That's wonderful. Well, let me also ask

05:48.950 --> 05:51.433
you about the school, okay? Yeah. If I send, you 
know, the school will be in my name. Yeah. And it

05:55.597 --> 06:00.102
will be a front for participating in quilting 
organization. And as I say, there's no money

06:00.162 --> 06:03.205
involved. It's a nonprofit organization, as you 
know. We've talked about this. And there's

06:07.550 --> 06:09.132
nothing to it. All you do is put $25 down, which I'm 
going to put $25 down. And that's it. And the Hill

06:15.900 --> 06:20.788
Country School of Folk Art is now in existence as 
soon as I file the papers. Okay? Well, they can meet

06:24.233 --> 06:26.156
in here. Certainly. In this room right here. Yes. 
And I have a big, my grandmother's old kitchen

06:29.081 --> 06:36.613
safe. Yeah. That I have made into a bookcase. Wow. 
Where I can put everybody's files in there.

06:44.452 --> 06:45.375
Wonderful. And put it against the wall in there and 
that long thing is where I'm going to file. Quilt

06:52.017 --> 06:54.520
pieces and quilts. Okay, well this is good. The 
school, it's nothing to it. It's mine. I mean, you

06:58.606 --> 06:59.767
know, it's there. It exists. Once the papers are 
filed for $25, it's all it cost me. And then we're

07:05.175 --> 07:09.400
organized and we can let nature take its course. We 
can let appreciation for preserving the folk arts

07:10.101 --> 07:15.088
take its course. Because, as I say, this whole 
thing has been done as a folk art project. There's

07:19.012 --> 07:21.916
no great wealthy person behind it. What's behind 
it is... Guts. Guts. That's right. So, I'm going to

07:31.306 --> 07:34.730
have to send you a... A determination. 
Determination, that's right. I'm going to have to

07:37.093 --> 07:39.115
get a post office box. Why don't you just use mine? I 
don't get things at Gunt Mill. Okay. All right,

07:44.498 --> 07:47.102
I'll do that. I'll do that. And later we could 
change it. If we ever needed to change the address,

07:49.546 --> 07:53.733
you know, we can have it amended and change the 
address. So that's no problem. Okay, why don't I

07:55.396 --> 07:59.503
just put your post office box down for the initial 
beginning. And we'll get everything done. And

08:02.269 --> 08:04.533
then it's chartered and it is in existence. And I 
met with a girl, the quilting club in Austin. Yeah.

08:12.486 --> 08:15.471
You know, those people will be interested in doing 
this. Well, I'm not a good hand to teach quilting. I

08:19.919 --> 08:21.321
do a lot of it. Yeah, but we can all teach each other 
too. That's the main thing. Everybody will have to

08:25.689 --> 08:28.434
do his own deal. Only thing is I can't stand them 
going down this way and pulling the thing up and

08:28.895 --> 08:34.104
doing this way. Oh, really? Now, if they can't get 
that needle and get going like that. Oh, yeah.

08:39.718 --> 08:41.441
That's what Mama taught me. Oh, I can do anything. I 
can't stand that down, straight, up, down, up.

08:47.689 --> 08:48.611
That's not sewing. You have to learn how to inch 
that little needle through those stitches so that

08:48.631 --> 08:53.538
you've got it even. Yes, ma'am. Yeah. Yes, ma'am. I 
bet you Mama put a needle and thread in my hand when I

08:56.261 --> 09:00.347
was three years old. She said, here. You do this 
way. That's probably right. Yeah, she did. And I

09:09.192 --> 09:11.636
was making my own doll clothes. I can't say they 
look like much, but I was doing that by the time I was

09:11.757 --> 09:16.946
gosh. So I know what you mean about sewing right. So 
we've got that going. And then we'll get you an

09:24.900 --> 09:27.625
exhibit. I've got my top. Only thing I have is tops. 
Well, that's okay. We'll get those. We'll get the

09:33.287 --> 09:34.050
tops. We'll get that exhibited. I mean, for his 
quilting. One of them I haven't put together yet.

09:39.767 --> 09:41.209
I'm going to put together. Well, I started one 
myself. I want to get it ready for the fall. It's

09:44.153 --> 09:48.078
finished, but I mean, I have to set it together. I 
understand, yeah. And that's all. I pieced each

09:52.404 --> 09:54.467
block as one along. Did you? Oh! And then I put it 
together. My goodness. And when I go to put it

09:59.794 --> 10:05.121
together, then what will make the lining hold 
Where you put your strips together, you quilt

10:05.590 --> 10:09.054
that. Yes. See, and that holds the lining 
straight, you see, and holds everything down.

10:16.702 --> 10:17.823
Wonderful. That's a different wrinkle to what 
anyone else has ever tried to do. They have

10:23.129 --> 10:25.471
different ways of putting them together. But I 
know how they wrinkle, and you've got seams, and

10:26.032 --> 10:32.779
you don't have any seams in your linings. 
Underneath only the one middle seam where it's put

10:33.434 --> 10:36.924
together. Well, I'll be. I'll be if I have to. It's a 
lot easier. Well, I don't know if it's a lot easier.

10:48.385 --> 10:51.949
But it makes a prettier finished product. Yes, 
yes. And that's what we're looking for. That's

10:54.872 --> 10:56.755
what you're right, that craftsmanship. That's 
the thing that you have down that a lot of people

10:57.335 --> 11:00.259
have. I know we stopped at a sale on the way up from, 
we saw some quilts and I just stopped to look at

11:00.279 --> 11:06.226
them. They were done on a machine. And you simply 
cannot have the craftsmanship that goes into

11:08.108 --> 11:15.116
quilting by... I don't think so. No, it's a body 
touch art. Quilting should be in so many ways. You

11:23.547 --> 11:29.817
saw the Irish

11:23.547 --> 11:29.817
Path. No, what was it? Or the Dunkard's Path. It was 
red set together with yellow. Yes. For a

11:36.869 --> 11:37.871
king-sized bed. Right, for David. David, uh-huh. 
I have that, and I have the pillow. Now I want to tell

11:42.925 --> 11:47.590
you, I'll put that one up against Mr. Anybody's for 
being perfect in squares. Oh, it is perfect. I

11:53.316 --> 11:53.736
know. I graduated in, you know, that just 
absolutely perfect. It was really good, but I

11:58.181 --> 12:01.664
don't know what the rest of it will look like. Well, 
I started one, too, like I say, so we'll see how it

12:01.684 --> 12:05.408
goes. Oh, it smells great.

12:17.992 --> 12:27.084
That's a

12:17.992 --> 12:27.084
beautiful cow.

12:30.148 --> 12:33.112
Look how fat. Yeah,

12:33.453 --> 12:41.383
fat's not beautiful anymore, I guess.

12:42.022 --> 12:43.223
It might be beautiful. Sure is comfortable, 
though. Sure is comfortable. You can sit. You can

12:47.268 --> 12:48.049
sit down. You can have a pretty good patty. Yeah. 
Well, that food's going to be, bread's going to be

12:51.353 --> 12:56.038
ready pretty soon, and you can have the. 
Wonderful. Have a meal. Good. I'm going to have to

12:59.142 --> 13:01.324
get busy going. Uh-huh. And sliced tomatoes. You 
are, okay. And we'll talk about that. Yes.

13:10.315 --> 13:11.556
So this is wonderful.

13:14.540 --> 13:21.868
Well, all this good history is now ready to be put 
down. I have to tell me another story. I love what

13:24.592 --> 13:28.316
you're telling me about the Culter for Cattle 
Company. Well, you can check on that at the

13:28.336 --> 13:34.984
university, but I'm sure that it's there. Because 
I had to write a paper back in the 60s. Uh-huh. And I

13:42.670 --> 13:46.535
found it in the San Antonio Library. You did. And 
that's where I got it. And I'm pretty sure that

13:49.239 --> 13:54.106
Austin University has... Oh, I'm sure that, of 
course, they have everything. They have

13:54.126 --> 13:59.053
everything, and they'll probably have that. You 
know, Austin, the flood really wiped everything

13:59.073 --> 14:02.298
out. It really did mess things up. Didn't it? It was 
amazing. I thought about you. And... Not because

14:08.135 --> 14:14.122
it's me, but if old Linden was living, let me tell 
you, Austin would have gotten some help. No, they

14:14.543 --> 14:15.604
wouldn't.

14:19.169 --> 14:20.991
They would have gotten a PDQ. Right. Yeah. Now I'm 
afraid we lost our influence in Washington. Well,

14:27.979 --> 14:34.227
I'm going to tell you right now, this fellow asked 
me to describe Linden. in five sentences to a

14:34.662 --> 14:45.096
person from outer space that had never seen a man 
and never knew him, what could I tell, describe

14:34.662 --> 14:45.096
him? How would I describe him?

14:49.883 --> 14:50.844
How would you do it? And I said, sir, do you expect me 
to make an atomic bomb within the next five

14:51.045 --> 14:59.877
minutes?

15:07.703 --> 15:11.347
I said he was a dynamic person. Energetic, 
vivacious, and persuasive. Definitely

15:18.134 --> 15:19.355
persuasive. And I want you to know he was a driver to 
work for. He never quit. But he didn't have a sister

15:26.683 --> 15:31.648
that built anything like him or a brother. He was 
the only one in that family that had any drive.

15:35.699 --> 15:39.084
That's an interesting thing that you have that 
drive too. That's right. But look at my brother and

15:40.286 --> 15:42.208
sister. Yes. Is it that there's only one out of the 
litter? Out of the group. There's just a constant

15:47.696 --> 15:52.664
hammer and push all the time. I'm that way. Push, 
push, push. Keep going. You can. You will. You

15:59.495 --> 16:00.076
must. Right. You cannot stop. You just can't stop. 
You've got to keep on. Yes. The elevator to success

16:07.947 --> 16:10.571
never runs. You have to take the stair a step at a 
time and a day at a time. It's hard, but that's the

16:17.301 --> 16:19.965
way it goes. And the only reason that Lennon made 
the success and was the millionaire, he was at the

16:21.245 --> 16:31.098
right place at the right time and knew the right 
people. That helps. That's exactly it. That's all

16:33.221 --> 16:34.142
of it. That's all of it, yeah. He got the breaks. It 
wasn't that I didn't work just as hard. But those

16:43.174 --> 16:48.662
things didn't cross my path. Mm-hmm. That 
opportunity never crossed my path. And she did a

16:53.532 --> 16:58.798
very remarkable thing with your own life, Eva, 
which I respect very highly. Well. It held, in a

16:59.639 --> 17:12.152
certain respect, I would think it was held to your 
being a woman, and you were a mother, and you were

16:59.639 --> 17:12.152
married, which in fact was a tie for you to 
responsibility. It was a great responsibility.

17:14.515 --> 17:17.618
And in my day, it was much more so than it is now. 
Correct. And one of the greatest compliments that

17:18.417 --> 17:28.429
I ever had paid me was paid to me by Lemon on 
Christmas before he died. He came down and spent

17:29.350 --> 17:33.254
about two hours talking. And he got up and he put his 
arm around me. And of course I'm so short that I came

17:36.258 --> 17:41.043
under the pit of his arm. And he says, you know, 
said, you are a remarkable person. I said, well,

17:48.286 --> 17:52.811
how do you mean that, Lennon? He says, just think of 
the many children's lives that you have touched.

17:58.057 --> 18:03.864
And what an impression that you have left on them to 
do whatever they did do well. I said, yes, but you

18:05.446 --> 18:09.310
had the leadership of the nation. You touched 
everybody's life. He said, I may have touched

18:12.354 --> 18:18.040
everybody's life, but said, you left an imprint 
that can never be erased. I agree. Well, I taught

18:22.590 --> 18:24.432
both of his daughters. And each time, I would say, 
Linda, it was hard for her to learn to write and hold

18:26.554 --> 18:37.883
her pencil properly. Because of poor muscle 
coordination, I thought, and the way that she was

18:38.524 --> 18:45.109
taught in the first grade. I had her in the fourth. 
And I said, no, Linda, don't. Use that finger. This

18:51.482 --> 18:57.390
index finger is the one that has the connection 
directly to the brain. It gives you that muscular

18:58.191 --> 19:00.073
movement. Not this one.

19:04.799 --> 19:06.201
Put it down here with this. And rest it on this 
finger. Make that one your wrist and fold it back

19:09.184 --> 19:12.749
this way. And then go on. And he says, Linda holds 
her pencil right today. Well, that's a little

19:20.660 --> 19:22.924
thing. But as he said, I guess I've left my 
impression on somebody, some trait. Oh, I know

19:30.859 --> 19:31.600
that's true. Because education has been a great 
thing to you. Well, when you come up not being able

19:37.230 --> 19:40.997
to go to school, when you're Old enough, and you 
have to wait until Margaret and Len and both get old

19:41.551 --> 19:49.040
enough to take to school, then you're responsible 
for them. And if they didn't want to do what you

19:49.641 --> 19:56.749
wanted them to do, they'd double team on you and 
work you over. And you'd go ahead and submit to it

19:56.849 --> 20:01.475
and say, yeah, we'll do that. And that's the way. 
And I'd finally get home with them in one piece.

20:09.445 --> 20:12.109
Maybe their shirt tail, his shirt tail would be 
out. Margaret's sash would be undone, her hair

20:12.210 --> 20:14.994
ribbon off. But I'd get them home. Right. Where did 
y'all go to school? First year was up at Stonewall.

20:23.408 --> 20:25.451
And how old were you then? Little schoolhouse 
where he signed the education bill. Right. And,

20:30.440 --> 20:33.124
well... I'm sure I was seven years old. So you 
started later. Mm-hmm. And how old were they when

20:39.070 --> 20:40.532
they started? Huh. Lennon was four. Four. 
Margaret was four. Mm-hmm. So they began. But

20:46.840 --> 20:50.164
Lennon was always as large as I was. Uh-huh. Large. 
And Margaret was, too. I was, I was just broad as I

20:53.649 --> 21:00.317
was long, but I never was tall. Mm-hmm. Never was 
tall. But you certainly did a lot with education in

21:05.167 --> 21:08.734
Texas yourself. When did you decide to be a 
teacher, Ava? All my life I wanted to be a teacher. I

21:14.606 --> 21:20.959
first wanted to be a nurse, and I just couldn't 
float that deal. And I wanted to be a teacher. The

21:23.847 --> 21:29.714
first time I ever taught school, I stood state 
examination and got my certificate. Because they

21:30.055 --> 21:31.276
would allow you to do that. They would allow me to do 
that back in the 30s. No, it was the 20s, by the way.

21:37.224 --> 21:39.727
The first school I taught was 1926. Where was that? 
Right here at Johnson City. In the Johnson City

21:43.611 --> 21:45.554
School itself? In the Johnson City School. I 
taught the 6th and 7th grade. What did you teach? I

21:51.168 --> 21:53.632
taught all of it, two grades. I had all the 
subjects, math and history and geography and

21:53.792 --> 22:09.977
English and civics and physiology, as we called it 
then, and spelling and writing and reading. And I

22:10.037 --> 22:11.460
can tell you one thing. I drilled on mathematics, 
reading, writing, and arithmetic. and the other

22:18.640 --> 22:20.942
came secondary. With two classes, it was hard to 
do. And you had 40 students in your room. It didn't

22:27.127 --> 22:28.548
come easy.

22:32.512 --> 22:35.734
I had Lennon's baby sister in the sixth grade, 
Lucia. Wow. So you were how old teaching the sixth

22:38.717 --> 22:40.939
grade then? I guess I was 18. About 18 years old. 
About 18 years old. How long did you do that? Well, I

22:49.100 --> 22:53.185
taught that year and I taught the next year. Let's 
see. Corky was born in 29. I didn't teach 29. I

22:59.092 --> 23:00.694
didn't teach 30. But I did teach in 32 and 33. Then 
on.

23:10.480 --> 23:12.442
Didn't know, and I'll take it back. I started to 
work. I never did get for $70 a month. Most never did

23:16.607 --> 23:17.528
get. I started out $40 a month.

23:23.714 --> 23:25.837
Up here at Johnson City. And then I got a $70 a month 
school up at Rocky Creek, which is out of town. And I

23:34.126 --> 23:36.148
drove up there. And then I finished out In 33, I 
finished out the school at Stonewall, up there,

23:39.505 --> 23:48.656
the little junction school. And I drove up there. I 
finished that one out for Stella Luxton. And Mr.

23:53.642 --> 23:59.669
Klein, that has been working for them for 20 years, 
was one of my students. Really? That's right, and

24:01.031 --> 24:04.315
his wife was one of my students. And it's just, when 
I go up there, I can't, I look at them, I was quite a

24:04.413 --> 24:14.724
young person, still, and they were big boys going 
to school. Great big boys. It's not too much

24:17.167 --> 24:21.772
difference, I guess maybe eight or nine years in 
our ages. But you were still their teacher. I was

24:24.115 --> 24:27.298
still their teacher, and they respected me. They 
were kind. Yeah. You went on then to get the

24:28.842 --> 24:30.585
education? I didn't. Because I have talked to you 
about this before. I decided that working, then I

24:34.490 --> 24:40.038
went to work for the PEC. And I worked for them as 
chief accounting clerk for five years. And we had

24:44.925 --> 24:48.670
17 counties to bail out. And Ida Mae Prane was 
cashier. And I was the bookkeeper. Mm-hmm. clerk,

24:57.367 --> 25:04.456
and

24:57.367 --> 25:04.456
we worked all the connects, disconnects. We took 
care of all the customers' readings and posting

25:05.757 --> 25:12.726
and everything, of all of the work, just she and I. 
The Pernell's Electric Cooperative was new. That

25:14.608 --> 25:17.011
we have right up here, was new then. And I started 
out right then. And then in 48, I

25:27.370 --> 25:29.794
decided that I was going back to college. And I went 
in the summertime of 48 to check in to see how many

25:30.875 --> 25:42.834
college credit hours that I had left when I went. 
And at that time, it was called a summer normal, and

25:42.874 --> 25:49.383
we had two-hour courses. And they changed it to 
three-hour courses. Well, I started out with 12

25:51.667 --> 25:56.314
flat hours. And I took courses that summer. And if I 
could make a B average, I could take an extra

26:03.162 --> 26:09.131
course. Well, I made my B average, I'll guarantee 
you. And then that winter, I took correspondence

26:13.698 --> 26:19.887
courses and went to school. And that was winter of 
48 and the first of 49. And then I went back to summer

26:25.724 --> 26:30.049
school, and I still had my B average. I took 15 hours 
of summer school. Went back, and in 1950, I walked

26:33.012 --> 26:39.720
down the aisle with my BA degree. Right. That's so 
right. At San Marcos? At Trinity University. At

26:44.685 --> 26:45.866
Trinity University. In the afternoons, I taught 
first grade. And the bus came through here. My

26:52.234 --> 26:55.377
students were all dismissed. 2 o'clock. And the 
bus came through here at 2.30. I boarded that bus

27:00.167 --> 27:07.658
and went into San Antonio and went to night school 
at Trinity University every night.

27:10.463 --> 27:11.825
And came back home. Now, this you don't do today. 
And on Saturday, I took Saturday classes for

27:14.829 --> 27:19.136
teachers. It's in Marcus. Mm-hmm. And I carried a 
full load down there. And when I tell you a full

27:25.455 --> 27:28.578
load, I mean a full college load. And on Saturday 
classes, down here. That's how I got through in

27:32.803 --> 27:35.546
1950. And you finished that teaching 
certification? Yes, sir. In two years. That was

27:42.394 --> 27:43.155
terrific. Well, you can bet on that. People don't 
do that today. They don't burn the candle at both

27:47.700 --> 27:49.822
ends. I could read on that bus just as fast as... I 
could anywhere else. I had geared myself to study

27:54.543 --> 28:03.591
on the bus and get my lessons and prepare myself and 
go right on. And then I said, well, that's as far as

28:03.611 --> 28:06.994
I'm going. And Olin said, no, Ava, you are not 
stopping now. I said, but I'm tired. He says, while

28:16.643 --> 28:22.468
you're in the mood of studying and you're Life is 
geared to that. You're going after that master's.

28:27.502 --> 28:30.787
I said, oh, and I just don't want to go back to school 
anymore. And he just walked to the door, and he

28:32.289 --> 28:40.000
says, you get your books and things ready, because 
I want you to have a master's degree.

28:43.145 --> 28:51.477
Well, I thought, well, if he is that persistent and 
really wants me to, that's the least I can do. So I

28:51.760 --> 28:53.562
worked in another year. And I taught school every 
day. I finished my master's.

29:03.075 --> 29:05.538
And that was in special? Well, I took my master's in 
education,

29:05.738 --> 29:20.518
but curricular guidance. in education and 
planning and steering a group. And I have thought

29:30.991 --> 29:41.367
so many times about what I have been through with 
our national park up here with these people. I'm

29:42.308 --> 29:50.100
head technician and have three people to 
supervise. And I couldn't understand. And when I

29:51.822 --> 29:59.029
was in San Antonio, I knew I was lead teacher for 
social studies for the district. You know, plan

30:00.570 --> 30:06.956
your curriculum for all the entire district. 
Let's us all get together, and we'll have a certain

30:06.996 --> 30:14.182
goal and a certain plan, and we'll work it all out 
together. So if one child is transferred from one

30:14.262 --> 30:19.447
school to another, he isn't lost. We'll all be. 
more or less working together. And I counted up

30:24.165 --> 30:28.251
those teachers, I had 65. But I wasn't qualified to 
take care of three women here. Yeah, that's the

30:33.118 --> 30:43.172
thing that people don't realize, that the 
National Park Service in Johnson City itself did

30:33.118 --> 30:43.172
more to the detriment of the local population and 
less to truly giving Lyndon Johnson his rights as

30:43.456 --> 30:52.707
an individual and president.
