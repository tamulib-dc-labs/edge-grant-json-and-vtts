WEBVTT

00:03.457 --> 00:17.422
Special guest, and

00:03.457 --> 00:17.422
we'd go down to their apartments for a lunch, and 
she'd have a light lunch, very nicely laid out as a

00:03.457 --> 00:17.422
kind of special event. Now, a typical word law 
reception for a book signing or anything like that

00:18.684 --> 00:26.578
would include what? Well, it would include a lot of 
drinks. Of what sort? Oh, anything you wanted.

00:37.917 --> 00:41.422
Frank's favorites were vodka with bullshot. With 
what? Bullshot, the mixer that you put in vodka.

00:46.829 --> 00:49.633
It's kind of a bloody marijuana. It's real spicy. 
It's got beef bouillon in it. Bullshot is one word?

00:55.297 --> 00:57.119
I think so. In quotation marks? I don't know. It's a 
trademark. Oh, it is a trademark. Okay. And

01:05.247 --> 01:07.929
bourbon he liked. But we would have, Rosemary 
would always have food.

01:18.619 --> 01:19.440
What about desserts? What kind of favorite 
desserts? You know, Frank had a favorite. I can't

01:24.698 --> 01:26.041
remember now what it was. Don't recall. All right. 
Describe the going away events before the ward

01:29.928 --> 01:33.936
laws left. There must have been some.

01:38.926 --> 01:39.928
Yeah.

01:42.854 --> 01:44.237
Well, I don't remember that.

01:49.972 --> 01:56.841
The most memorable party I remember was when 
Alfred A. Knopf came to visit. He was a friend of

01:57.842 --> 02:01.427
Frank Wardlaw's from the old days. And we had a 
luncheon on the boardroom table in what was then

02:03.029 --> 02:14.844
Frank's office. And we had all of the staff. And a 
few family members were there, Rosemary and Ruth

02:19.992 --> 02:32.003
Gromyla, and my wife, and Claire, my daughter. Our 
daughter went with us. And our daughter had a place

02:34.966 --> 02:40.090
all to herself. I guess she was four years old at the 
time. And they sat her between Mrs. Knopf and

02:49.827 --> 02:51.810
Margaret Ingram. And so she was across the table 
from my wife and me. And she just behaved

02:56.157 --> 03:00.583
wonderfully well, was very well behaved. And 
everybody commented on what a good girl she was.

03:04.329 --> 03:17.910
And then after the lunch,

03:04.329 --> 03:17.910
Chris and Claire and I drove the Knopf's to the 
hotel in Austin. where they were going to spend the

03:18.177 --> 03:21.082
night before heading back to New York. So we got to 
ride with them in the car, and I got to ask Alfred

03:22.183 --> 03:27.632
Knopf some questions. Of course, he was pretty 
elderly then, and I think he really wasn't paying

03:27.732 --> 03:33.742
too much attention. I think he was dozing most of 
the way, but at least we got to say that we rubbed

03:33.762 --> 03:39.952
elbows with the Knopfs. Can we take a break for a 
second? I need to... Who were some other famous, in

03:46.595 --> 03:55.227
these A&M years, who were some other famous 
celebrities that you encountered?

03:58.591 --> 04:08.825
Well, I don't think that any were that famous to me, 
as famous as Knopf. I think

04:08.905 --> 04:14.593
there were lots of Texas people, of course.

04:20.770 --> 04:28.101
Yarborough, for example, used to be at the Texas 
State Historical Association meetings. Ralph

04:28.702 --> 04:29.363
Yarborough. Ralph Yarborough, and let me think.

04:40.078 --> 04:43.163
Well, I can't think of anybody specifically, but 
some of the lesser lights, I think.

04:49.510 --> 04:55.241
We were heading toward the Ward Law retirement. 
Describe the Ward Law retirement. There must have

04:59.970 --> 05:02.354
been all kinds of parties. Describe the Ward Law 
retirement parties. or the big event? Well, I

05:09.799 --> 05:10.901
can't. As I said earlier, I don't really remember 
that. Well,

05:15.970 --> 05:19.656
I do. Yeah, I do. It was at Three C's Barbecue in 
Bryan. I think that was the Wardlaw's retirement.

05:30.313 --> 05:33.298
And had a huge barbecue.

05:37.497 --> 05:40.480
reserved the whole place just for the press's 
party. And I saw that it sat across the table from

05:42.181 --> 05:49.248
John Tweetin, I think. And it was an open bar and all 
the barbecue you could eat. And it was quite an

05:59.358 --> 06:00.519
affair. Don't remember a lot about it because of 
the open bar. Were there some stories told, you

06:05.263 --> 06:07.285
think? Probably. I'm sure there were.

06:12.246 --> 06:22.958
And in terms of the style of leading the press, how 
did Lloyd, how did his style differ from Frank's?

06:26.161 --> 06:36.192
Lloyd was, let the staff do, gave the staff a lot 
more responsibility than Frank had. Lloyd was

06:37.015 --> 06:46.124
more of a hands-off manager than the

06:37.015 --> 06:46.124
single focal point of the press. And Lloyd

06:46.384 --> 06:54.832
came up with projects and did acquisitions. And 
then in many cases, he turned those projects over

06:55.773 --> 07:00.837
to me to carry through on. But he was mostly the idea 
man who developed things. Lloyd did some really

07:06.479 --> 07:13.285
great work for the press in fundraising during 
those early years. He was the one who got the

07:13.806 --> 07:27.859
funding from the Moody Foundation in Galveston 
for faculty and non-faculty publications. We

07:28.299 --> 07:31.683
already had the Moody Natural History Series 
established. That was one of the revolving funds

07:31.703 --> 07:35.406
that Frank Wardlaw had set up. But the endowment 
for publications by faculty members, A&M

07:35.791 --> 07:55.268
faculty, and a separate endowment for 
publications by people other than faculty

07:35.791 --> 07:55.268
members, were both accomplishments of Lloyd's in 
the early 80s. They have been tremendous helps to

07:59.210 --> 08:01.794
this press. That kind of endowment is something 
every university press should strive to get.

08:07.442 --> 08:11.448
Describe how those endowments work, those 
revolving funds. Well, the revolving funds are

08:12.049 --> 08:15.575
different from these endowments. The revolving 
fund was set up in a particular subject area, for

08:15.915 --> 08:22.285
example, The Moore Texas Art Series or the Merrick 
Natural Environment Series, a certain amount of

08:22.754 --> 08:43.018
money was provided by the donor, and usually we 
knew we had books to publish in those particular

08:22.754 --> 08:43.018
subject areas. We knew what we were going to 
publish. We'd publish a couple of those books, and

08:45.040 --> 08:49.285
then a portion of the income from the sales of those 
books would go back into the series fund. Normally

08:56.092 --> 08:56.672
what? A smaller percentage would go, well, 25% 
would go into the overhead account of the press.

09:03.280 --> 09:09.647
But 75% of the sales income then would go back into 
the series fund. And so it kept it revolving and

09:09.707 --> 09:11.970
growing. If we made the right selection of books, 
those funds would grow over the years.

09:19.589 --> 09:35.748
Of course, and then the Moody, the two Moody 
Foundation series, not series, but endowments

09:19.589 --> 09:35.748
were just straightforward gifts of money to the 
university press to be used in any way we wanted.

09:36.509 --> 09:43.497
One fund was for publications by faculty members 
and the other was for anyone else. And those funds

09:48.665 --> 10:17.794
grow interest and uh... so we have to to be careful 
not to spend them down but uh... both of them have

09:48.665 --> 10:17.794
grown over the years and are extremely valuable to 
us now to help us publish books that otherwise

09:48.665 --> 10:17.794
would not be financially feasible of the various 
series funded by revolving funds is there one that

09:48.665 --> 10:17.794
has been most notable for its success is there one 
the moody natural history series i think has done

09:48.665 --> 10:17.794
better than Well, it's done tremendously well. 
And the centennial series established by the

10:20.237 --> 10:26.523
Association of Former Students has also been a 
tremendous series. That one,

10:27.084 --> 10:33.249
we've done a wide variety of books in it. Of course, 
it was begun to publish the centennial history of

10:33.310 --> 10:43.379
the university and the pictorial history, and 
also the Shewitz portfolio of prints. But since

10:44.080 --> 10:47.443
then, we've also published a lot of other things 
that that have nothing to do with the history of the

10:47.693 --> 10:58.943
university, but are good Texas history or other 
kinds of important subjects that need to be

10:47.693 --> 10:58.943
published. So we've been able to use those funds to 
cover the upfront costs of publishing and

10:58.963 --> 11:08.812
production costs, get the books published. And 
our selections have been consistently good in

11:08.832 --> 11:15.418
that series over the years. So the fund has grown. 
And you said that in leadership style, Frank was

11:18.203 --> 11:31.886
more centralized and

11:18.203 --> 11:31.886
Lloyd more decent. In hindsight, which worked 
better for this press? Well, they both worked well

11:36.373 --> 11:39.278
and at the right times. It was fine that... that 
Frank was more centralized, more hands-on, more

11:42.436 --> 11:46.641
do-it-himself. Because at that time, we were all 
young and learning. And it was good to have someone

11:50.365 --> 11:57.113
with that kind of experience guiding the 
direction of the press. And then after some years,

11:57.574 --> 12:10.008
after we had learned our jobs and Lloyd came in, he 
was able to turn over a lot of the things to us

11:57.574 --> 12:10.008
because we had the experience to handle them then. 
And then he could go ahead and do the fundraising

12:11.815 --> 12:16.961
and the kinds of acquisitions that he did. And he's 
director about how long? He's director from 70, he

12:19.904 --> 12:27.993
was about 10 years director of the press. Late 70s. 
78 to 88. To 88. And during that time, the number of

12:32.198 --> 12:37.945
titles per year increased? Oh, yes. We've made our 
first big jump. in the early 80s, around 82, 83. And

12:47.571 --> 12:58.262
we jumped from the 16, 18, 20 max titles a year that 
we were publishing then up to about 26 or 28 a year.

12:59.383 --> 13:03.808
And we did that over the space of about three 
publishing seasons. So it was quite a

13:04.288 --> 13:10.695
well-defined and drastic jump for us. Describe 
what that jump meant for those of you on the staff.

13:15.558 --> 13:19.164
Well, it meant a tremendous amount of work, 
increase in the workload. We didn't increase the

13:20.305 --> 13:27.596
staff that much immediately, although a couple of 
years later we did hire another editor. And then

13:28.738 --> 13:33.505
gradually the staff began to expand a little bit 
from there. But it was... We had the manuscripts

13:40.628 --> 13:42.470
coming in. We were over the hump of those early 
years where we were struggling to find good books

13:42.550 --> 13:49.458
to publish. And we were doing some things that 
maybe we shouldn't have done simply because we

13:50.479 --> 13:58.148
wanted to have the numbers of books. Such as? Well, 
some of those books that I was talking about

13:59.730 --> 14:09.201
earlier that were by faculty members that really 
didn't fit any of the programs that we were

14:09.485 --> 14:20.525
publishing in, but we needed the books and we felt 
that it was a commitment to the university and the

14:09.485 --> 14:20.525
faculty to publish those books. If we hadn't been 
as

14:29.060 --> 14:36.051
eager to fill out our list as we were then, we might 
have had second thoughts about publishing those

14:29.060 --> 14:36.051
or some of them. Right. Now, who made the decision 
to increase the number of titles per year? Lloyd

14:41.059 --> 14:41.640
did. And he felt that since we had the good 
manuscripts coming in, that we ought to just go

14:42.641 --> 14:56.383
ahead and take the bull by the horns and do them. He 
went to, let's

15:01.076 --> 15:10.610
see, I forget who the president was then. But I 
think, actually, I think that was during the

15:10.670 --> 15:17.741
period that the press was assigned to the 
chancellor. It was actually a system press for a

15:18.141 --> 15:21.626
few years in there. And I think Frank Hubert was the 
chancellor. And Frank went to the board of

15:26.789 --> 15:37.282
directors or regents, I forget which it was then, 
and got recapitalization of the press. Frank

15:37.562 --> 15:45.352
Wardlaw had originally obtained 
capitalization, I think in the amount of $200,000

15:37.562 --> 15:45.352
when the press was started. And Lloyd went back to 
the board through Frank Hubert, and they got a

15:46.954 --> 15:55.665
commitment from the board to recapitalize the 
press and so that also was a major factor in

15:56.607 --> 16:24.707
deciding to go ahead and expand the the size of the 
list as far as you were aware when dr williams

15:56.607 --> 16:24.707
became chancellor back in 77 did the press report 
continue to report to him or did it stay on campus

15:56.607 --> 16:24.707
report to jarvis miller They reported to Jarvis 
Miller. All right, that's what I thought. And

16:29.918 --> 16:34.965
how long was he president, two years? Until 1980. 
Okay, so three years. Yeah. And I think it was about

16:42.255 --> 16:46.641
1980 then that it was that- To Hubert. Hubert 
decided to take charge of the press and it was

16:46.661 --> 16:52.610
transferred to his oversight. And then it went 
back to the, to the president I think when Frank

16:57.205 --> 17:01.795
Vandiver became president. As far as you were 
aware, Did the press at all suffer during either of

17:04.225 --> 17:10.673
those changes, going to the system and then coming 
back? In either case, was the press damaged? No. In

17:14.958 --> 17:20.945
fact, I think it was to our advantage that Frank 
Hubert took such a great interest in the press. And

17:21.105 --> 17:27.313
he was the person who was most instrumental in 
getting this building built for the press. I think

17:27.715 --> 17:32.721
we would have languished in those trailers 
another four years if it hadn't been for him. He

17:33.723 --> 17:48.781
was very interested in what we were doing and felt 
that we needed a place of our own to work and wanted

17:33.723 --> 17:48.781
to see, was willing to put up the fight to see it 
through. And I don't think Jarvis Miller would

17:50.083 --> 17:53.267
have done that. You know, I'm making a note to 
mention to Charles.

18:02.304 --> 18:08.794
I wonder, has anybody done anything to say thank 
you to Frank Hubert? You know, like, meaning on a

18:10.537 --> 18:14.443
birthday or a Christmas? Yeah. Because? Well, no, 
I don't know. We invited him to participate in the

18:17.387 --> 18:22.495
25-year celebration last year, and because of 
health reasons, he declined. See, he's

18:27.449 --> 18:30.493
semi-mobile at best. Yeah, that's what I 
understand. I haven't seen him in a long time. But

18:35.400 --> 18:38.064
I've been told that he's not well. But we wanted to 
honor him at that anniversary. And in fact, his

18:45.013 --> 18:52.684
name was prominently mentioned in our 
presentation.

18:53.525 --> 19:04.015
that he was the person who was really responsible 
for saving the press and getting us this building

18:53.525 --> 19:04.015
during that time. Describe how you recall the 
process of this building becoming a reality. It

19:09.201 --> 19:10.041
took forever.

19:14.746 --> 19:22.654
We also had an advocate in the university's 
engineering department. And remind me the name of

19:23.258 --> 19:31.126
the fellow who wanted to save the oak trees during 
the MSC. Bob Rucker. Bob Rucker was our advocate in

19:32.027 --> 19:35.971
engineering. And he had a hand in the planning of 
the building and the design. He worked with Lloyd.

19:45.341 --> 19:47.043
Lloyd consulted with all of us. The staff had a 
voice in how we wanted the building laid out.

19:52.807 --> 20:16.114
design plans were presented to us and this was the 
one that we we picked we liked this one do you

19:52.807 --> 20:16.114
remember who the architect was not really it's on 
the plaque by the front door there who selected

19:52.807 --> 20:16.114
this location as far as you're aware uh i don't know 
i don't know i do know though that uh in the original

19:52.807 --> 20:16.114
plans that the big gold mesquite tree in the back 
was going to be cut down and the building was going

20:17.090 --> 20:43.671
to corner of the building was going to be built over 
that and i said to lloyd why not move the building up

20:17.090 --> 20:43.671
eight feet six feet eight feet and leave that tree 
let it let it live it had been there a long time it

20:17.090 --> 20:43.671
didn't need to be cut down wasn't hurting anything 
and so he he talked to bob rucker and rucker change

20:44.343 --> 20:45.404
the plans. Was there good staff input into the 
details of the building on the interior? Yes. Like

20:53.332 --> 21:00.879
I say, Lloyd consulted with all of us on what we 
thought we wanted in our offices and how we wanted

20:53.332 --> 21:00.879
them arranged. The plans changed. Originally the 
conference room, I believe, was going to be an

21:15.123 --> 21:16.805
open-air atrium. And then of course that was moved 
forward and is now the little atrium that is right

21:19.268 --> 21:32.563
outside the front entrance between it and the 
director's office. But that was originally going

21:32.583 --> 21:38.390
to be much longer and run deeper into the building. 
When did y'all begin to feel that the A&M Press was

21:42.258 --> 21:49.007
achieving national status, a strong national 
image.

21:52.572 --> 22:08.113
We felt that we had always had national attention 
among university presses because of Frank

21:52.572 --> 22:08.113
Wardlaw's

21:52.572 --> 22:08.113
influence and his reputation. When we began 
developing a national

22:09.241 --> 22:27.503
reputation, I think was probably with the 
publication of Frank Vandiver's biography of

22:09.241 --> 22:27.503
Pershing, and it was a runner-up in the National 
Book Awards that year, and I think we began to

22:09.241 --> 22:27.503
realize that Yeah, we're a real small press, and 
we're down here in southeast Texas, but we can have

22:27.668 --> 22:42.267
as much of an influence on publishing and on 
national letters as any other publisher. And that

22:43.409 --> 22:45.051
gave us a real boost. That was a tremendous,

22:45.111 --> 22:50.679
gave us a lot of confidence. Did that help to 
attract manuscripts, you think? I think so. I

22:57.822 --> 23:04.914
think we began to get military history 
manuscripts as a result of publishing that book.

23:04.934 --> 23:10.263
And we really hadn't given much thought to 
publishing military history until we did that

23:04.934 --> 23:10.263
book. And then afterwards, things began to be 
available that we could pick up and publish. Now,

23:17.274 --> 23:20.980
there is no national ranking of university 
presses, is there? Not an official one, no. That's

23:25.193 --> 23:25.654
what I thought. So there's not a top ten or anything 
like that? No, not really. Among public

23:28.779 --> 23:43.542
university presses,

23:28.779 --> 23:43.542
Charles and I have done some ranking and we've 
calculated that we're probably down around 20. So

23:44.720 --> 23:46.542
we're in the top 25, I think. Top 20 or 25. Among 
publics. Publics, yes. Of course, we can't

23:51.548 --> 23:56.975
compete with some of the private, Chicago, Yale, 
Harvard. Now what is their secret to success?

24:01.300 --> 24:01.781
Endowment. Over many, many years. And long 
history. Yeah. Is there any one of those that the

24:09.593 --> 24:16.330
average well-informed person would identify as 
the top? Well, I don't know. Harvard University

24:20.099 --> 24:25.813
Press or Chicago, either one I think.

24:27.025 --> 24:31.852
It depends on whether they're readers in the 
humanities or in the social sciences. Which of the

24:33.515 --> 24:40.626
university presses has the biggest list of titles 
per year? Which one?

24:48.254 --> 24:54.441
among American university presses, not counting 
Cambridge and Oxford, which of course are like

24:48.254 --> 24:54.441
commercial publishers. California probably has 
the largest list. Back to locally, Lloyd is here 10

24:59.547 --> 25:07.998
years, and then he retires, and he's followed by 
whom, Lloyd Lyman? Rick Stetter came in, I guess it

25:08.078 --> 25:11.662
was 88. And he's here how long? Five years. 
Describe his director style. Oh, Rick was very

25:24.793 --> 25:33.142
California style, very laid back, laissez faire. 
He

25:35.144 --> 25:45.936
was a friend of everyone and just one of the most 
personable people you'd ever want to meet. Yeah,

25:48.548 --> 25:54.436
it was a very California style. That's about the 
best way I can describe it. And then he leaves and

25:57.260 --> 26:00.945
he's followed by? Well, Mary Miller was the 
interim director for a year and a half. Okay. From

26:06.233 --> 26:07.354
within. Yes. Assistant Vice President for 
Finance and what's the administration, I guess.

26:19.968 --> 26:22.871
And then she's followed by whom? Tom Rotell. And 
Tom came from? University of Pennsylvania Press.

26:28.576 --> 26:29.877
And he was here five years. And then Charles Backus 
began last summer, about a year ago. Tom, what was

26:37.645 --> 26:39.126
his style? Tom was a businessman, very 
businesslike. And I've learned, I think I've

26:44.215 --> 26:50.841
learned more from Tom than from anybody I'd worked 
for before. I learned that it's not

26:50.861 --> 27:03.093
a crime to think about the bottom line in 
university press publishing. And in fact, it's

27:03.853 --> 27:07.577
essential that you keep your eye on the bottom 
line. And Tom was excellent at doing that. At the

27:11.162 --> 27:14.085
same time, he was a wonderful publisher, too. He 
had a really good feeling for books and what was

27:14.325 --> 27:28.500
important and what

27:14.325 --> 27:28.500
was wanted by both scholarly readers and trade 
readers. And he really gave us all a feeling that we

27:29.621 --> 27:36.788
were really accomplishing something. In terms of 
the bottom line, which have been, as far as you're

27:37.493 --> 27:50.669
aware and in press history, the most successful 
and the least successful books? Bottom line, in

27:51.710 --> 27:54.453
terms of sales. Sales compared to cost. Well, of 
course, I think our best sellers have been the most

27:57.377 --> 28:05.707
successful, Landscapes of Texas. Mm-hmm. and 
Fishes of the Gulf of Mexico. Landscapes is a

28:09.772 --> 28:14.157
beautiful photography book, color photography. 
It was photographs from Texas Highways Magazine,

28:15.038 --> 28:33.640
and we compiled several hundred pages of color 
photography in one volume, and it's just been

28:15.038 --> 28:33.640
tremendously popular for years.

28:34.092 --> 28:37.296
I don't know now how many copies of it we've sold. I 
have the sales report right there on the desk if you

28:38.577 --> 28:42.501
want to look it up. Okay.

28:52.572 --> 28:55.696
Okay, this is as of 1st of August. Landscapes of 
Texas.

29:02.712 --> 29:05.415
Lifetime sales $43,622. And you think that's the 
best seller? That's our best seller. Fishes of the

29:09.559 --> 29:14.123
Gulf of Mexico, I think, is the second. Let's see 
what it is.

29:23.333 --> 29:26.776
All I have here is the second edition of that. I 
don't have the first edition, but I think it was up

29:26.796 --> 29:32.702
around $35,000 when we I ended it and published the 
second edition and the second edition is up around

29:33.745 --> 29:42.532
4,500 copies now. So close to 40,000 total then. As 
far as you and other members of staff would

29:47.597 --> 30:03.330
normally calculate it, what would be the number of 
copies to sell that becomes kind of a break-even

29:47.597 --> 30:03.330
point? Oh, it varies so much from book to book. It's 
hard to say. Can you give some examples? Well, if

30:08.555 --> 30:24.725
you're talking about a very scholarly monograph 
and you're only publishing at most 750 copies,

30:08.555 --> 30:24.725
you'd have to sell at least 650 of them to break 
even. And then, of course, the others would be

30:27.610 --> 30:30.876
publicity copies, free copies for review and so 
on. So you'd have to sell practically every one to

30:30.956 --> 30:34.081
break even. If you're talking about a natural 
history field guide and you're publishing 10,000

30:34.101 --> 30:48.687
copies,

30:34.101 --> 30:48.687
then probably your break even is going to be around

30:34.101 --> 30:48.687
2,000 copies maybe. And what about an art book? An 
art book depends on the price you put on it. If you

30:54.745 --> 31:03.193
put a realistic price on it and really limit sales, 
then you could probably break even within your

30:54.745 --> 31:03.193
print run. If you lower the price down to the market 
demand, then you're probably not going to break

31:04.955 --> 31:16.066
even in a reasonable print run, and you need 
subsidy. That's why the Moore Texas Art Series

31:16.166 --> 31:20.550
Fund is so important. because that helps us get 
over that hump and publish those books.
