WEBVTT

00:01.634 --> 00:07.059
These medics look like John Wayne, Pancho Villa, 
and Audie Murphy all wrapped up in one. They're

00:07.099 --> 00:10.763
humping ammo for everybody. They've got 
bandoliers with ammunition, you know, and you'd

00:11.043 --> 00:17.589
have to say, how about getting your medical bag 
there, boy? Oh, yeah, yeah, I forgot about that.

00:20.672 --> 00:31.422
Because all of a sudden it was real world for them, 
and that's the last time you ever heard about their

00:20.672 --> 00:31.422
conscientious objectors because those guys know 
us out of the rifle. They didn't care one way or the

00:31.840 --> 00:34.663
other about his personal feelings. And neither 
did they once it got real to them, which is what most

00:35.604 --> 00:41.649
people in the United States don't understand.

00:44.172 --> 00:50.838
They haven't been, they've never been afflicted 
with true fear on a daily basis. And they just

00:51.679 --> 00:53.741
really don't know what it's like. It's kind of like 
some woman trying to explain to me what it feels

00:53.801 --> 00:58.465
like to have a baby. Well, she can kind of tell me, I 
can kind of, but still there's nothing like being

01:01.996 --> 01:07.464
there and get the full benefit of the situation. 
And you cannot explain to somebody who hadn't been

01:07.644 --> 01:17.179
to Vietnam what Vietnam was really like. And, in 
fact, it's so different, even people who went to

01:17.800 --> 01:29.317
Vietnam, if you have one Vietnam veteran will talk 
to another Vietnam veteran, you'd think that

01:17.800 --> 01:29.317
there's some common bond there. And, yeah, there 
is a little bit, But probably the first question

01:31.645 --> 01:38.753
they're going to ask is not what unit you were with, 
but when were you there? Because if you were there

01:40.275 --> 01:49.586
in 65 or 66, I'm not saying it was like a vacation, 
but it was not that much happening. And it changed.

01:51.588 --> 01:54.852
And it changed, and the intensity changed. And the 
nastiness changed and increased. But if you were

01:59.630 --> 02:12.044
there in 68 and 69, which was the really high part, 
then you have, you might say, an even more common of

01:59.630 --> 02:12.044
a bond with certain people. And if you try to talk to 
some Air Force guy, you know, about Vietnam. You

02:20.454 --> 02:28.523
know, hard times to the Air Force guy was when they 
couldn't get smoke glass windows for their hooch

02:20.454 --> 02:28.523
with their refrigerated air conditioning. You 
know, where these guys were scrounging, you know,

02:29.204 --> 02:40.097
for items like that, smoke glass windows or the 
little portable air conditioners and stuff like

02:29.204 --> 02:40.097
that, or their stereos. Infantry, yeah, I was 
scrounging for Claymore mines, grenades, uh,

02:46.891 --> 03:04.253
stuff like that, uh, for just to have around, you 
know, that was important, you know, for me, and,

02:46.891 --> 03:04.253
and, you know, they were the nice, nicer things to 
have, that was your frosting on the cake, uh,

02:46.891 --> 03:04.253
because, uh, they were very effective, and they 
were, you know, real meaningful for you. Uh, I'd

03:05.715 --> 03:16.408
been in, uh, Vietnam for, I guess, probably, uh, 
seven or eight months, and, and, uh, I went to, uh,

03:17.047 --> 03:18.809
visit an Air Force friend. My heavy weapons NCO had 
a brother who was stationed at Cameron with the Air

03:19.189 --> 03:30.479
Force, and we went and visited him while we were 
trying to get some supplies. And we visited him.

03:32.761 --> 03:46.513
Well, we slept on a bed, had sheets, had showers 
with hot water, a real luxury and things that are

03:32.761 --> 03:46.513
real important to me right now. I love flush 
toilets. I like hot water and I like clean sheets. I

03:53.808 --> 03:56.111
didn't have that for the most part over there. 
Contrast that to what you had as compared to what

03:56.291 --> 04:07.722
they had, such as what you slept on, where you had to 
use the restroom, things like that. You're

04:09.583 --> 04:14.308
talking about the North Vietnamese or the enemy 
type people? Your infantry. Oh, my people? as

04:17.560 --> 04:19.282
opposed to the Air Force type people. Well, you 
know, the Air Force people had a cafeteria they

04:20.062 --> 04:31.253
went to three times a day, and they had their meals 
prepared for them, and it didn't have any bugs in

04:20.062 --> 04:31.253
it, and it was good, clean, edible food.

04:34.015 --> 04:39.180
My last six months, I had to shop on the economy. In 
fact, I had to buy, you know, my food. I was

04:41.923 --> 04:44.125
furnished no food. My meals were not paid for. I had 
to buy all my food while I was in Vietnam, which I did

04:46.315 --> 04:49.660
not like. Our government paid all the salaries and 
all the munitions used and food for the

04:50.341 --> 05:03.139
Australians, the New Zealanders, the Koreans. 
Everyone who came that fought on our side, our

05:03.579 --> 05:09.167
government paid total expenses for all their 
people. American officers have to pay brawl their

05:12.792 --> 05:15.697
food, even in combat situations. Whether you eat 
it or not, they take it out of your pay, which I

05:15.737 --> 05:21.527
didn't think was too cool. My last six months, 
which was when I was on this mobile advisory team,

05:22.889 --> 05:37.433
which consisted of five people, you had your team 
commander, an executive officer, there was two

05:22.889 --> 05:37.433
officers, you had a medic, a heavy weapons NCO and a 
light weapons NCO, and these were basically your

05:37.970 --> 05:42.437
teachers. You know, you taught this, you taught 
that officers mainly taught the tactics, and your

05:42.857 --> 05:53.673
NCOs taught your, you know, all about the weapons 
that you were going to use. So, I might teach a

05:54.354 --> 06:02.526
class, say, like we're going to have a class today 
on an L-shaped ambush, and this is the parts that

05:54.354 --> 06:02.526
you're going to use. the weapons that you'll use 
and and this is the way you set things up you draw

06:02.928 --> 06:27.822
little pictures and show everybody how to do it and 
There's the trail this is where the guys come in

06:02.928 --> 06:27.822
when they get in what they call the kill zone and you 
usually pop a claymore mine on them and that starts

06:02.928 --> 06:27.822
everything everybody starts shooting and 
whoever Stands around the latest usually wins,

06:02.928 --> 06:27.822
you know But It's kind of funny, a lot of the 
situation out there, but I was spending about $200

06:29.405 --> 06:36.232
a month for food. I made $471 a month.

06:44.220 --> 06:50.966
Bobcay or a head of cabbage, I would spend $2 for a 
head of cabbage.

06:55.270 --> 06:57.893
Rice, I could buy rice. I could buy rice from the 
Americans, the CIA or the United States Agency for

06:58.582 --> 07:04.530
International Development. Not that the CIA was 
there. But I could buy rice from them. I'm talking

07:10.899 --> 07:16.227
about your long grain, double A, wonderful Uncle 
Ben's type rice. Not instant, but just real rice. I

07:19.892 --> 07:22.676
could buy 100 pounds of that for $13.50. 100 is 
about what it cost me. Conversely

07:28.484 --> 07:40.683
to that situation, those same people were giving 
rice to all of the Vietnamese nationals there.

07:41.564 --> 07:44.028
They'd just come up and they'd just give them all 
they wanted. It was amazing. And of course, you

07:45.810 --> 07:49.396
couldn't give it to an American, but you could give 
it to a Vietnamese. Why did they say they couldn't

07:49.716 --> 07:51.799
give it to you? We weren't authorized. It wasn't a 
program for Americans. It was a program for the

07:55.125 --> 07:56.787
Vietnamese. because we were, you know, their 
little rice paddies were getting blown up and that

07:57.543 --> 08:03.873
kind of stuff, so we'd just go ahead and give them 
completely harvested rice. And really what we

08:03.893 --> 08:23.263
were doing, they were still growing their rice in 
rice paddies, and we were really just providing

08:03.893 --> 08:23.263
all the logistical support for the North 
Vietnamese because they'd just come in there and

08:03.893 --> 08:23.263
take all this bagged rice away from them, you know, 
and they'd have all this rice stacked up in their

08:03.893 --> 08:23.263
little bellages, you know, a little hooch, and 
those guys would just come in there and take it. So

08:23.885 --> 08:28.650
you weren't really helping anybody in any way 
other than the enemy, who was trying to get you.

08:29.271 --> 08:33.416
Makes a lot of sense. Well, when you were out there 
fighting, did y'all jabber-type prisoners, or

08:33.436 --> 08:39.663
they were just on the shot? Well, one thing I really 
had a great deal of respect for the North

08:40.063 --> 08:51.917
Vietnamese type of military. To me, they were as 
good as we were. The only difference between us and

08:54.167 --> 09:02.975
them was they had a lot less firepower at their 
disposal than did we. But they were motivated. I

09:06.118 --> 09:09.701
thought they did just a real good job. The South 
Vietnamese Army I was less than impressed with.

09:16.547 --> 09:17.768
They didn't do a good job. The South Vietnamese 
Army, as well as the government, It was just

09:22.238 --> 09:24.841
corrupt. All they did, they just took our stuff, 
sold it, used it, you know, really gave you a real

09:25.341 --> 09:35.873
negative feeling toward them. I don't dislike 
Vietnamese, you know, on an individual basis, but

09:36.954 --> 09:47.165
the mountain yard people over there were kind of 
like the Indians that we talked about earlier.

09:47.986 --> 09:49.828
Very nice people, honest. You could leave a $300 
camera like if you just kind of left your camera on a

09:52.495 --> 09:59.583
table or something in one of the little hooches, 
you'd come back a week later and still be there. It

09:59.603 --> 10:00.704
wouldn't even been touched. Whereas the 
Vietnamese, there was still anything and

10:01.425 --> 10:08.413
everything wasn't tied down, and then some things 
were tied down. I didn't like that about them. I

10:14.100 --> 10:18.925
didn't like their attitudes about a lot of things. 
Of course, I don't know if I'd been in their

10:19.327 --> 10:21.429
situation. I might have the same feelings. 
Because, you know, to me, when you peel it all back,

10:23.632 --> 10:33.462
it doesn't really make any difference whether 
it's a French bomb, American bomb, or North

10:23.632 --> 10:33.462
Vietnamese bomb. When it goes off, the damage is 
still done. People are hurt. Properties are hurt.

10:40.469 --> 10:41.210
Animals are hurt. And you can say you're sorry. The 
only difference between us and everybody else is

10:43.953 --> 10:48.017
our answer to everything is... Well, let's say we 
kill three of your chickens. Here's X dollars for

10:50.628 --> 10:57.138
those chickens and all the chickens that those 
chickens would produce and all their little

10:50.628 --> 10:57.138
grandchildren for chickens. And we pay them for so 
many generations of chickens or hogs or whatever

10:57.599 --> 11:01.644
it happened to be.

11:08.735 --> 11:15.625
Probably, as far as fighting type action, there 
again down where I was the last six months. Most of

11:19.783 --> 11:22.307
that took place at night. It was again from 9 
o'clock at night to about 3 o'clock in the morning.

11:28.815 --> 11:35.645
We located as a central location at a Vietnamese 
train center. We built us a little house out of just

11:39.668 --> 11:42.452
ammo boxes and just anything we could find, you 
know. And I stole a lot of things. I was the biggest

11:45.235 --> 11:46.757
thief in Vietnam. I mean, and I really mean that 
literally, and I say it with a great deal of pride,

11:47.719 --> 11:52.885
but I had my antics. I'd only steal from Americans. 
They were the only people that had anything

11:55.429 --> 11:56.971
anyway. But I could not get any support from my own 
people because I was under, basically, I was

11:57.772 --> 12:09.287
assigned to the Vietnamese Army because I was 
training them. my last six months. And basically

12:11.628 --> 12:26.882
one of our little missions was to show them, you 
know, fill out a form and, you know, 18 different

12:11.628 --> 12:26.882
copies and give one to this place and, you know, and 
you would start requesting all of these, whatever

12:11.628 --> 12:26.882
you needed, food ammunition, you know. But it just 
doesn't work in a Vietnamese unit because most

12:26.902 --> 12:32.027
stuff had already been sold anyway. So you always 
had these little breakdowns everywhere. Yeah,

12:34.329 --> 12:36.051
we're trying to teach them how. How to make an 
American army out of Vietnamese armies. Kind of

12:39.220 --> 12:41.563
like trying to make a Democrat out of a Republican. 
It's useless. That's right. And before that, they

12:45.188 --> 12:56.283
didn't take the time to loan because they were 
either stealing what they were supposed to be

12:45.188 --> 12:56.283
ordering or they were selling what they'd already 
ordered and it was just a breakdown. You had that.

12:56.843 --> 13:02.251
There were lots of black market stuff going on 
there with Americans and with Vietnamese. The...

13:07.283 --> 13:11.727
The Vietnamese, you had different groups of 
people in Vietnam. You had your ethnic

13:11.768 --> 13:14.610
Vietnamese, then you had these Mont Yard people. 
And the Mont Yard people, they hated all the

13:15.471 --> 13:23.419
Vietnamese, North, South, East, West, Indian, 
Mayan, they didn't like them, any of them, not one.

13:23.439 --> 13:24.520
They had no use for them. And the only reason they 
were on our side was because our government said,

13:25.061 --> 13:36.953
okay, boys, you help us out, and when this deal's 
over, then you're going to get these four

13:25.061 --> 13:36.953
provinces, which are like counties, You're going 
to get Darlac, Khantung, and I forget the name of

13:37.152 --> 13:46.145
the other two provinces, and that's going to be 
your cut out of the war when we win this deal. And so

13:47.146 --> 13:50.511
that's the only reason why they kind of work 
together. So the South Vietnamese had a conflict

13:51.613 --> 14:00.585
between their own people and the people that live 
in their provinces, as well as against the North

13:51.613 --> 14:00.585
Vietnamese and the American side. Right. I've 
heard that they not only resented the Americans,

14:01.992 --> 14:07.080
they resented all of our allies that already 
helped them. Oh yeah. Well, I hate one, I hate all

14:08.121 --> 14:12.228
their cousins and everything too, so I tried. Made 
for a good working relationship. Didn't it

14:15.773 --> 14:16.695
though? My only, the only thing that I had total 
power over was that if I felt like that I or any of my

14:16.775 --> 14:28.573
people was in danger, and that this Vietnamese 
officer, if he was in charge of an operation, they

14:28.840 --> 14:37.193
had no control over me, and I had no control over 
them. But what I could do is say, well, boy, if you

14:39.476 --> 14:43.422
want to do that, that's fine. You just go ahead and 
do it. But I tell you what, I ain't going to do that.

14:48.430 --> 14:51.755
And when I left, so did my firepower. And that's 
what they needed. And that's what they needed, and

14:53.318 --> 14:55.601
they didn't want to go up. So basically you had... 
effective control over, because all you had to do

14:57.477 --> 15:01.282
was threaten to leave. If you left, so did your 
firepower, and they couldn't do without. And by

15:05.647 --> 15:07.710
threatening them, that still made them resent 
you. Right, and they just, yeah, right, they just,

15:07.750 --> 15:17.622
you know, they could, you could tell, you know, 
well, you sorry sucker, you know, you did it to me

15:07.750 --> 15:17.622
again, and, you know. We've already discussed 
about, you said that, that North Vietnam, but they

15:21.878 --> 15:24.400
were smart about fighting against you at night. 
Well, can you kind of compare them to how, kind of

15:24.941 --> 15:32.587
tell me what they would normally do in the jungle, 
how they fought, like? You know, little traps and

15:33.708 --> 15:35.290
stuff like that? Yeah. Well, the whole country 
over there is just riddled with what they call the

15:38.513 --> 15:49.262
punchy pits, which are little holes that were dug 
in the ground, maybe two or three feet deep. And

15:49.342 --> 15:50.383
what they do is they would, They would take bamboo 
sticks

15:50.853 --> 16:00.743
and sharpen them real sharp and harden them in a 
fire. So they're just like steel. And then they

16:03.005 --> 16:07.249
would cover them with either human or animal 
feces. And then they'd plant them in the ground

16:08.210 --> 16:12.474
with the pointed side up. So when you stepped in a 
hole and fell, then those sticks would go like up

16:16.722 --> 16:23.049
your legs or through your hands or your arms or 
wherever you happen to land on, you know. But what

16:23.430 --> 16:44.755
that does is you get all the bacteria from the feces 
of the animals or humans gets into your wound and

16:23.430 --> 16:44.755
over there you had a real hot, moist climate which 
is just a perfect breeding ground for bacteria and

16:23.430 --> 16:44.755
so your wounds would get infected and They played 
the numbers games like we do. If you kill somebody,

16:49.079 --> 16:51.023
they're just dead. You stack them up like cordwood 
and deal with them whenever you can. However, if

16:54.629 --> 17:03.625
you wound somebody, for every person that's 
wounded, it takes about three people to take care

16:54.629 --> 17:03.625
of them. So if you want to play the numbers game, 
then it's better to wound somebody because Every

17:08.461 --> 17:12.325
time you lose somebody, it takes that many more 
people to take care of them, that much more

17:08.461 --> 17:12.325
facilities. To transport them. Right, all kinds 
of things. So,

17:15.789 --> 17:21.395
yeah, we didn't take too many prisoners. We took 
some prisoners. Most of the time, you know, you

17:23.377 --> 17:28.683
just, they're shooting you, you shoot them until 
they quit shooting, you know. And they don't give

17:29.504 --> 17:30.645
up. And so most of the time, you had to kill them. 
Every once in a while, you would take a prisoner

17:38.465 --> 17:39.747
Normally, you would just send them back. You'd 
call in and have them backed out with a helicopter

17:39.787 --> 17:46.376
and take them back to some interrogation camp. And 
they would talk to them, see what they knew, and

17:46.396 --> 17:49.780
that kind of stuff. And then they'd put them in a 
PILWP compound. What other kind of traps did you

17:54.387 --> 17:55.829
use? Well, they had all kinds of, they were real 
crafty in doing things. They had lots of different

18:04.857 --> 18:08.442
types of bombs that they would make.

18:11.167 --> 18:28.874
They would, you know, you might, Americans are 
real bad about going through anywhere they go and I

18:11.167 --> 18:28.874
see a stock of bananas, you know, and I go, oh, I'm 
going to go get a banana, you know, and they go over

18:11.167 --> 18:28.874
there and rip a banana off and move that banana 
stalk and it blows up in your face, you know. You had

18:28.894 --> 18:30.196
things like that. You had the same thing with 
pineapples. You had lots of different tripwires,

18:34.169 --> 19:03.906
which was another thing that made everybody real 
nervous, is because they would take dud rounds

18:34.169 --> 19:03.906
that are artillery shells that didn't explode, 
and all they'd do is just defuse them and crack them

18:34.169 --> 19:03.906
open and get the explosive out of them, and then 
they would make, you know, like a bomb, and they'd

18:34.169 --> 19:03.906
use, like, glass or nails or just other steel 
fragments, so, and pack that in there, and then if

18:34.169 --> 19:03.906
you trip something, you know, then that would blow 
you know like on you and they were you know they were

19:04.223 --> 19:31.733
detonated with either tripwires or they might use 
a bind you know for a tripwire you know you didn't

19:04.223 --> 19:31.733
know if that bind was really a bind or was it a 
tripwire you know so you and you have to really be

19:04.223 --> 19:31.733
observant when you're over there anything that's 
just out of place at all really needs to be dealt

19:04.223 --> 19:31.733
with a real cautious type basis You'd go in a lot of 
these little villages, and when you go into a

19:32.135 --> 19:46.292
village, then what you really do is you search 
everything that you can think of in the village,

19:32.135 --> 19:46.292
and then you destroy whatever you find. It might be 
munitions, it might be food, it might be medicine,

19:46.392 --> 19:54.583
it might be radio parts, or you just don't know what 
you're going to find. And they had stuff

19:55.023 --> 19:58.227
everywhere.

19:59.303 --> 20:26.307
take like little logs they'd hollow out and they 
might have like mortar rounds in there or they'd

19:59.303 --> 20:26.307
have like false walls in the little hooches or 
false ceilings or false floors and so you'd really

19:59.303 --> 20:26.307
take a real good eyeball on a little building that 
you'd go into you know you'd look at it real good and

19:59.303 --> 20:26.307
you kind of mentally step it off uh outside of it and 
you go on the inside and find it's a couple steps or a

19:59.303 --> 20:26.307
step you know shorter and you know hmm wonder why 
it's shorter on the inside is on the outside you

20:26.523 --> 20:53.340
know how do you train yourself yeah right you learn 
all this stuff uh you know if you pay attention if

20:26.523 --> 20:53.340
you don't pay attention i'll be around anyway so uh 
anyway uh they'd hide things they'd bury things

20:26.523 --> 20:53.340
like they had little pits for like their animals to 
you know kind of like where pigs would swap around

20:26.523 --> 20:53.340
in mud so they had those you know same little pigs 
and they had uh you know, like water buffalo, and

20:53.675 --> 20:58.040
they'd kind of roll around in the mud, cool off, 
that kind of stuff. You know, they'd bury, like,

20:58.060 --> 21:01.524
rifles and stuff underneath that. And, of course, 
we had, you can use, like, a mine detector. All it is

21:06.010 --> 21:08.092
is a glorified metal detector. You know, so you 
could use, you know, things like that, and you

21:08.853 --> 21:17.523
start running those things through water, mud, or 
it's over an area, and you pick up metal, you know,

21:08.853 --> 21:17.523
if something's down there. You can do the same 
thing if there's wood or walls, stuff like that,

21:17.583 --> 21:21.488
though. We found people hiding behind walls. You 
know, yeah, we had,

21:25.615 --> 21:49.568
you know, like this one afternoon, this is kind of, 
I guess, a bad story, I guess, but we were doing a

21:25.615 --> 21:49.568
joint operation with the South Vietnamese unit, 
and we had had, there's a deal there called Spider

21:25.615 --> 21:49.568
Holes, where these guys, you know, dig these 
little holes and they, you know, they camouflage

21:50.105 --> 21:59.075
it real good and they jump up and they'll shoot at 
you and they'll try to kill somebody and then

21:50.105 --> 21:59.075
they'll cover themselves back up and it's real 
hard, you know, you can't hardly find them. And,

21:59.775 --> 22:09.466
uh, but you know it's somewhere so, you know, you 
start really looking and then you can usually

21:59.775 --> 22:09.466
find, it's like everything else, once you start 
doing something then you can get good at it. And,

22:10.107 --> 22:19.757
uh, so we, you know, of course we're rooting out 
these people and there was this one little group in

22:10.107 --> 22:19.757
this one village, you know, and, uh, uh, You know, 
they kept shooting at us, you know, and we'd stay

22:21.104 --> 22:26.409
out of the way of their bullets and stuff. And so we 
told them, the Vietnamese, to come out, you know,

22:27.170 --> 22:33.856
or we were going to kill them. And they needed to 
come out and just turn themselves, you know, give

22:34.897 --> 22:38.220
up. And they weren't going to be hurt, and they 
weren't going to be killed. Of course, they didn't

22:42.865 --> 22:44.206
believe us. And, you know, they start shooting at 
you again every time you talk. And I just told them,

22:48.009 --> 22:50.672
I said, this is your last chance. And are you going 
to come or not? And they start shooting again. I

22:56.577 --> 22:59.321
just took some grenades and rolled in there. And, 
you know, they really do a job. And anyway, this one

23:03.006 --> 23:08.954
particular afternoon, and this lady who was 
standing out there, she was real upset. And she had

23:08.974 --> 23:10.716
to be the wife. And I told her, man, you tell them, 
sucker. We ain't kidding. And, you know, get them

23:13.480 --> 23:16.544
out of there, because we don't want to kill them. 
But, you know, we're going to, though. So she was

23:18.682 --> 23:21.146
talking to them, and she couldn't get them to do 
anything. And they told me it was their last

23:21.226 --> 23:23.469
chance. So anyway, they threw them a grenade down 
there, and they killed them. But anyway, it was

23:27.034 --> 23:29.418
wiped out three generations. It was this lady's 
father, her husband, and her son. She wiped out

23:35.327 --> 23:39.232
three generations there in a period of five 
minutes. And they were North Vietnamese? Yeah.

23:41.536 --> 23:41.856
Why was she out? Well, it's not that they were North 
Vietnamese. They were just either Viet Cong,

23:44.039 --> 23:48.486
which are like VC sympathizers. Not everybody in 
the United States agrees with everybody else over

23:48.922 --> 23:52.126
here. We all have our own differences and our own 
different beliefs. And they did too, so you had a

23:56.691 --> 24:01.537
lot of BC sympathizers over there. Let

24:02.158 --> 24:06.383
me ask you some more of these questions. You talked 
about, you know, you rode there six months as a

24:06.403 --> 24:12.831
staff and six months on the line. Yeah. How'd you 
feel about that careerism? Did you feel like,

24:16.850 --> 24:26.239
being six months there, that some officers, 
knowing that it was their last six months or their

24:16.850 --> 24:26.239
last month, they didn't fight as much, knowing 
that they'd get to go home in the United States? No.

24:28.061 --> 24:29.462
Everybody just fought the same? Yeah, because 
it's kind of like playing a football game. If you

24:34.847 --> 24:37.590
start letting up, you're going to get hurt. If you 
quit paying attention, if you quit hitting hard,

24:38.171 --> 24:44.697
it's when you kind of sandbag it a little bit, 
that's when you get hurt. And over there, if you let

24:45.115 --> 24:54.484
up at all, you're gonna get either somebody killed 
or you're gonna get killed or something like that.

24:55.105 --> 24:57.147
So you really, you had to be going 100%. So you felt 
like everybody got it all they had? Yeah, I did. I

25:03.773 --> 25:10.600
sit here and the news media over there, not over 
there but over here, and everything I've ever seen

25:11.103 --> 25:13.607
in the news media. I've never seen anything 
positive from American news media about Vietnam.

25:18.353 --> 25:23.280
And it was all a totally negative atmosphere. I 
personally didn't find that to be the case. The

25:27.126 --> 25:34.917
stereotype Vietnam veteran is a guy who's a drug 
addict, can't hold a job, just a total misfit. I

25:35.200 --> 25:36.802
don't even know anybody like that. I've never seen 
anybody like that. I guess there's some out there.

25:40.428 --> 25:43.993
Why would they want to be on drugs when that affects 
their mind? They've got to have that mind intact to

25:44.013 --> 25:46.737
fight that enemy. That doesn't make sense to me 
either. I agree with you. I've seen the Vietnam

25:50.543 --> 26:03.722
movies, Platoon and several other little Vietnam 
movies that have come out. I didn't really find

26:04.107 --> 26:06.170
them to be that real. I thought platoon was real, 
but they perpetrated that show like

26:06.210 --> 26:22.634
all infantry people over there, all your platoon, 
which is platoon was the unit in Vietnam. It was

26:22.654 --> 26:30.165
either tank platoon or infantry platoon, whereas 
in World War II, it was army against army. Well, the

26:30.787 --> 26:34.812
Vietnamese unit was a platoon. It was an army. You 
didn't have any major clashes of this battalion

26:36.915 --> 26:41.981
against that battalion or anything like that. It 
was all just dirty little skirmishes all the time

26:42.001 --> 26:46.026
going on. But the movie platoon was a culmination 
of every war story I ever heard. And they

26:51.733 --> 26:54.477
perpetrated it like that. Boy, that's what 
happened every day. I thought they did a real

26:56.639 --> 27:18.364
negative disservice to the American soldier 
because in that movie, to me, it perpetrated them

26:56.639 --> 27:18.364
as being people who got their kicks by bashing 
little old ladies' heads in with their rifle butts

26:56.639 --> 27:18.364
or stopping little kids or stuff like that or being 
drug addicts and everybody hyped up or something.

27:18.384 --> 27:19.325
I didn't see any of that. I guarantee you that if I 
had people, any of my people, were on drugs, I

27:26.373 --> 27:29.256
killed suckers myself. Because they could affect 
your life. Not could, they would. And either I was

27:33.461 --> 27:43.933
naive, and I don't really think that was the case, 
but I didn't have any of my people were doing it. All

27:44.173 --> 27:53.123
that drug stuff, most of the drugs that were going 
on over there were people back in the base camps,

27:44.173 --> 27:53.123
which is where the big concentration of people was 
in the first place. As I mentioned earlier, I've

27:54.537 --> 28:05.317
probably been to a couple hundred different 
presentations on Vietnam that I show my slides

27:54.537 --> 28:05.317
that I was over there with, giving lots of talk. The 
Rotary Optimist, Lions Club, Ladies Club, all

28:05.337 --> 28:11.108
different kinds of schools and all kinds of stuff. 
And I found that most of my World War II type age

28:11.789 --> 28:15.837
group of people You know, their big question was, 
well, how come did that thing, that war take so long

28:16.002 --> 28:32.437
to terminate when all you had was really a piece of 
ground the size of the state of California? When

28:33.438 --> 28:38.883
they were used to going, you know, 20, 30 miles a day 
like in Europe or something like that, you know,

28:33.438 --> 28:38.883
they were hooking them. You know, why could you, in 
effect, never get anything done? Well, reason you

28:43.627 --> 29:08.200
couldn't because there wasn't any fronts over 
there there was no front you didn't know where the

28:43.627 --> 29:08.200
enemy yeah the front was everywhere you know in 
fact that was my question when i first got there was

28:43.627 --> 29:08.200
where's the front i said you're here it's 
everywhere you don't know where it's everywhere

28:43.627 --> 29:08.200
it's nowhere and uh so which is frustrating for 
americans because americans are used to to having

29:08.669 --> 29:29.720
a problem and dealing with the problem and then 
going on and forgetting about it, which was real

29:08.669 --> 29:29.720
frustrating to people over there because you 
would go take this hill this day, and then you would

29:08.669 --> 29:29.720
leave there and go over here and do another one, and 
then six days later you'd go back there and take

29:08.669 --> 29:29.720
that same hill again. Well, I did that last week. 
Let's go to a new place. But they had just moved, you

29:32.964 --> 29:34.727
know. So it was really kind of a real frustrating 
type of atmosphere over there. The big thing was

29:40.786 --> 29:46.491
that we won all the battles, and we lost the war. 
Wasn't it, it was hard because you'd see these

29:47.152 --> 29:53.618
Vietnamese people, and you couldn't tell if they 
were the enemy or if they weren't. And then during

29:53.638 --> 29:55.700
the day, they might be your friends. But at night, 
when you shot them, you'd find out those weren't my

29:55.760 --> 30:00.224
friends after all. That's right. And I had that 
very thing happen to me. I had some people who were

30:04.407 --> 30:12.534
cleaning our hooches when I first got over there 
when I was in that administrative capacity. And a

30:14.456 --> 30:25.566
couple weeks later, they got killed as being in a 
Sapper attack at night, which is carrying bombs

30:14.456 --> 30:25.566
and blow things up at night. And so you did have 
that. And it was just common. And you didn't know

30:30.110 --> 30:33.233
who they were. They didn't wear uniforms. They all 
looked alike. That's right. Did you, were you ever

30:36.807 --> 30:39.830
wounded? No. You're unfortunate. Yeah, I have, 
you know, I got blown off this roof one night, off

30:42.813 --> 30:52.083
two stories, but I didn't break any bones. And, you 
know, technically, you know, if you get hurt any

30:52.203 --> 31:01.313
way, whether it's sitting on a bar stool and you 
fall over and break an ankle, You get, if you're in a

31:01.597 --> 31:04.321
combat zone, you get a purple heart bar. I mean, 
even if you scratch yourself, you get a purple

31:04.822 --> 31:08.188
heart. Of course, I had lots of little scratches 
and stuff like that, but I didn't ever, you know,

31:09.310 --> 31:17.523
put in any purple hearts. I wasn't into that. Did 
you receive any medals? Yeah, I got a Bronze Star,

31:24.975 --> 31:28.060
but... and told a lot of other people. Not even a big 
deal. It was more of a thank you, I think, than

31:33.638 --> 31:36.862
anything else.

31:40.245 --> 31:41.967
Medals were kind of funny. I used to write up, when I 
was with the 2nd and 1st Cav, I used to write up, in

31:42.068 --> 31:58.266
effect, awards for medals, usually for senior 
officers who basically were nowhere near any

31:42.068 --> 31:58.266
action. But there again, I told you that everybody 
in it was from West Point, and they took care of

31:58.904 --> 32:05.031
their own. I wrote up, I can't tell you how many 
medal awards, silver stars, bronze stars, for

32:06.793 --> 32:19.528
colonels, majors, lieutenant colonels who were 
not there. So most of those people that you saw

32:20.629 --> 32:23.072
hanging medals on their chest didn't deserve 
them. They're more or less promoting their career

32:27.342 --> 32:35.270
just by saying, I was over there, and they take 
their... I'm not saying that all people did that,

32:35.410 --> 32:49.684
because they did, and there were some real 
legitimate things, but you'll find that a lot of

32:35.410 --> 32:49.684
people that really deserve things never even put 
in for it, didn't want them, were put in for it, were

32:35.410 --> 32:49.684
awarded it, and say, I don't want them. There was a 
lot of that. I don't want any of that. I don't want

32:52.451 --> 32:53.814
nothing about that. They just did their job. Yeah, 
and you had asked people, what are you fighting

32:56.919 --> 32:59.162
for? I said, 365 days. That's what it's for, 365 
days. And so because I was with MACV my last six

33:05.112 --> 33:15.368
months, I got to see a lot more of the political side 
of the war. I made lots of trips to Saigon. and got to

33:18.115 --> 33:20.138
see some things. I asked a lot of questions. What 
did you think about that government in Saigon a

33:22.802 --> 33:25.826
while ago? Before you mentioned it was corrupt, 
can you tell me some instances where you saw this?

33:30.833 --> 33:33.597
Yeah, I can give you a few little examples. And of 
course, they can't be corrupt unless they've got

33:34.178 --> 33:39.786
something to be corrupt for and about. And I think 
you can thank our politicians in this country for

33:40.527 --> 33:46.536
helping them in that department. I'll give you a 
nice example of that. I talked to a guy in Saigon who

33:48.879 --> 34:00.817
was in charge of dispersing docking fees for the 
military, for the Department of Navy. Here we are.

34:02.840 --> 34:08.628
We went over there, built them the best harbors, 
warehouses, docks. They had nothing. We went over

34:10.411 --> 34:16.320
and built them the best of everything, the best 
that could technically be built at that

34:10.411 --> 34:16.320
particular time. built it, paid for it with 
American taxpayer dollars, brought them all of

34:16.823 --> 34:31.180
the munitions, supplies to fight their war, in 
effect, for them, furnished people, material,

34:16.823 --> 34:31.180
everything. And then when we would pull up a ship up 
to these docks, then they would charge us docking

34:31.640 --> 34:39.209
fees for unloading all this stuff. And I talked to a 
guy that paid, he personally paid $550 million

34:39.229 --> 34:45.396
dollars in docking fees in one month. I'll give you 
another example. Most of the supplies were for

34:52.478 --> 34:54.581
them to use. Sure. It was either directly for them 
or indirectly through the American, the

34:55.943 --> 35:05.113
Australian, New Zealand, or Koreans, everybody 
else who was over there. It was all for their direct

35:05.554 --> 35:08.397
benefit, but indirectly. used by somebody else. 
Why did we pay that? Why didn't we say, no, we built

35:12.325 --> 35:15.089
these for you and we're helping you? Well, because 
there's lots of things that go on in war. Nowadays,

35:19.414 --> 35:21.617
your monotype wars are not wars. It's just like 
Vietnam really wasn't a war. It was a conflict.

35:24.641 --> 35:25.643
Korea wasn't a war. It was a police action. I think 
if we have a nuclear holocaust, it's just going to

35:28.366 --> 35:34.695
be a disagreement of opinion. I don't know if we're 
all these definitions come from, but to me a war is

35:36.693 --> 35:43.663
where people fight and shoot and get killed and 
hurt people and things like that. And war in itself

35:44.624 --> 35:47.008
is very simple. You either kill people, you 
destroy the enemy, you destroy their supplies, or

35:48.009 --> 35:54.178
you destroy their morale. In effect, you make it 
not worth the effort. If you're coming down south

35:58.885 --> 36:06.396
to fight, and you're from North Vietnam, you're 
coming down south, and all of a sudden you find out

35:58.885 --> 36:06.396
that all of your homeland just been blown away. Is 
this really worth it? But see, our government

36:12.440 --> 36:14.502
chose not to do that. We could have made it. I 
guarantee you I could have ended that war in 90 days

36:16.224 --> 36:19.527
without nuclear weapons. But yet I would have done 
things that has been done in all other wars. I would

36:25.713 --> 36:26.534
have killed people. I would have destroyed 
supplies. I would have made it demoralizing for

36:28.456 --> 36:31.059
the enemy. And I'm talking about bombing their 
towns, their schools, their hospitals. you know,

36:37.088 --> 36:47.781
flooding, breaking their dams and flooding out 
all their whole systems, their electricity, you

36:37.088 --> 36:47.781
know, all their hiding places, which are all 
underground. There was a big dam in Hanoi, which

36:48.482 --> 36:55.130
just the water alone would have drowned 
everybody, you know. It would have stopped. Yeah,

36:56.652 --> 36:58.794
above ground, below ground, either one, you know. 
But see, we didn't do that. I mean, it's really,

37:00.597 --> 37:04.421
it's just really stupid. And you sit there and you 
wonder, You know, why? You know, because all the

37:07.177 --> 37:16.033
movies you saw with John Wayne and Audie Murphy and 
all those guys, you know, it's like, you know,

37:07.177 --> 37:16.033
those are bad guys, you know, you go get them, and, 
you know, it's over. But our government, because

37:17.555 --> 37:23.726
of our politicians, they didn't let the military, 
the military won. The politicians didn't win,

37:24.808 --> 37:28.314
see. They're the ones that sold the country out. 
They're always looking for maybe this will

37:30.599 --> 37:39.050
happen, or they procrastinated waiting for 
something to happen and didn't let the military do

37:30.599 --> 37:39.050
what they knew what to do. Well, they had other 
reasons for doing it, and I'll give you a nice

37:39.330 --> 37:43.536
example of that. Let me give you another example of 
some more little corruption there about the

37:43.736 --> 37:49.264
government. Our government leased over 80 hotels 
in downtown Saigon alone. uh... for for troop

37:57.818 --> 38:27.184
building space that's where they live you know 
america he's gonna have electric shaver and he's

37:57.818 --> 38:27.184
gonna have a stereo and all that kind of trash and 
uh... but all of our electronic gear is designed to

37:57.818 --> 38:27.184
run on alternating current well because the the 
french and other people in europe most of their

37:57.818 --> 38:27.184
electricity is what they call dc or direct current 
uh... it doesn't work with our stuff so what we did

37:57.818 --> 38:27.184
is our engineers went in and they rewired all these 
buildings you know so our guys have a place to plug

38:27.620 --> 38:31.105
in their shavers, listen to their music. And then 
again, we would put these big 30kW generators out

38:33.268 --> 38:44.685
in front of these hotels, you know, to provide the 
generator capacity to run the electricity for the

38:33.268 --> 38:44.685
hotel. The Vietnamese government would come 
along and put electric meters on our generators

38:45.426 --> 38:52.236
and charge us for electricity. Yeah. And I got 
pictures of all this. It's not just some figment of

38:57.418 --> 38:59.480
my imagination. I didn't dream up all this stuff. 
Well, I'll tell you another little interesting

39:03.005 --> 39:08.551
story about something else that you really might 
consider. That's why we were really there. And I

39:10.554 --> 39:16.160
don't think it was so we might use the premises so 
they can have a democratic society. I think that's

39:16.180 --> 39:17.883
a bunch of horse manure. The only reason why we were 
there and the only reason why any war in all of

39:24.370 --> 39:28.356
history has been fought has been for the almighty 
dollar. Because you're not going to convince

39:28.536 --> 39:31.941
anybody else to go fight over a cause. I guarantee 
you, no one's going to get upset about slavery. I

39:37.789 --> 39:43.017
mean, you were taught in school, as I was taught in 
school, that civil war was fought over slavery. It

39:43.297 --> 39:44.639
wasn't fought over slavery. It was fought over the 
almighty dollar, just like all the other wars. And

39:48.665 --> 39:51.429
the South had to have slavery to make the money. To 
economically make it, and the North and they were

39:54.526 --> 39:56.329
doing real good. And the North didn't like that. 
They were eating into their backyard. That's what

39:59.894 --> 40:01.917
it was really fought over. I mean, all your big, you 
know, anti-slavery people like Lincoln, credit

40:03.039 --> 40:07.225
sucker, owned slaves. George Washington owned 
slaves. I mean, who are these guys? You know, let's

40:09.809 --> 40:11.832
get back and call a spade a spade. You know, really 
tell it like it is. Same thing in Vietnam. As I

40:18.823 --> 40:21.327
understand it, They have huge forests, and of 
course I've seen most of them, they have huge

40:22.235 --> 40:27.641
forests of real exotic hardwoods. Trees and 
forests that are 100,000 years old, they're just

40:29.042 --> 40:35.009
prime wood. There's lots of people that use lots of 
wood. Vietnam has a lot of minerals on it. They have

40:39.193 --> 40:42.937
oil reserves off the coast. It's really kind of 
funny, Vietnamese, The North Vietnamese and Viet

40:48.593 --> 41:08.014
Cong, when they like to blow up something, they'll 
pass up two or three truckloads of ammunition,

40:48.593 --> 41:08.014
which costs a tremendous amount of money, in order 
to blow up a 5,000-gallon

40:48.593 --> 41:08.014
tanker truck that has gasoline or diesel fuel on 
it. Because when they shoot a B-40 rocket, which is

41:08.375 --> 41:16.744
kind of like a bazooka-type deal, when they shoot a 
B-40 rocket into a gasoline truck, It makes a big

41:17.062 --> 41:21.246
fire and there's smoke and, you know, they like 
that. You know, they can see that they've done

41:21.266 --> 41:22.947
something. Whereas you blow up ammunition, it's 
all over, you know. So, you know, why would they,

41:27.030 --> 41:31.134
you know, pass up a deal in order to do that? You 
know, it doesn't make a lot of sense for you or I

41:31.154 --> 41:37.019
because we think let's get rid of the ammunition, 
you know, gas is cheap and, you know. But they like

41:37.319 --> 41:42.003
to go after the smoke and fire and they can see the 
action. Well, Shell, Exxon, Texaco, Gulf,

41:47.133 --> 41:56.664
Exxon, Shell, Texaco, I think Gulf is over there 
too. They had gas stations all over, just like here

41:57.284 --> 42:02.030
in America, gas stations everywhere. But you 
never saw one get blown up. And this tremendous

42:06.675 --> 42:14.524
desire that I know that they like to see things blow 
up and smoke and burn, how come they didn't hit all

42:06.675 --> 42:14.524
these gas stations?

42:17.204 --> 42:19.727
I mean, wouldn't you, if you liked that, wouldn't 
you go do that? Well, the deal was, from what I

42:20.308 --> 42:41.496
understand, was that Shell and Exxon and Texaco 
and all these companies were paying the North

42:20.308 --> 42:41.496
Vietnamese cash every month not to blow their 
things up because it was cheaper for them to pay

42:20.308 --> 42:41.496
those guys cash just, you know, rather than 
rebuilding a new service station every week. So

42:42.437 --> 42:44.360
they just made cash payments to them. So we're 
sitting there funding, you know, You know, it's

42:47.242 --> 42:48.763
just a crazy deal.

42:51.546 --> 42:52.787
You see what I'm talking about? I can see. And it 
doesn't make any sense what happened. You tell me

42:56.371 --> 42:59.274
why you believe we began the war. Can you tell me 
your thoughts on why we lost the war? I mean, you

43:02.036 --> 43:04.679
covered a lot of it already. You mean why I think 
that we pulled out? Yeah. Politically, it just

43:10.024 --> 43:13.367
wasn't a good deal to do anymore. had really 
stirred up a bunch of stuff on the home front. There

43:17.369 --> 43:18.891
are a lot of people upset about it. Well, the 
politicians are just scumbags, in my opinion.

43:25.540 --> 43:26.601
They'll sell us out. I don't really fear the 
Russian Army. If I fear anybody, it's our

43:29.505 --> 43:31.508
politicians. I think they'll sell us out tomorrow 
if it was beneficial for them. Because you've got a

43:36.154 --> 43:42.662
group of people who have done nothing their whole 
life but sell out this group to benefit that group,

43:36.154 --> 43:42.662
and then when the winds change, They sell out that 
group and benefit the other group. That's the

43:45.550 --> 43:47.833
nature of a politician. That's the essence of 
being a politician. That's why they're there.

43:51.479 --> 43:53.121
They're there for their personal benefit. 
They're there to ride that horse as long as they can

43:53.522 --> 43:56.166
ride it. You place the blame on the politicians. I 
certainly do, 100%.

44:02.996 --> 44:12.109
I think Nixon, he had the political guts to pull 
out, and it was going to be a big world black eye for

44:02.996 --> 44:12.109
us. And it was and has been. But he knew it was the 
proper thing to do. Either if you're not going to

44:20.820 --> 44:25.185
fight the war to win, then get out. And because our 
politicians wouldn't turn the military loose,

44:25.225 --> 44:35.737
Nixon had the decency to pull out. Then we're not 
going to waste any more people's lives. We're not

44:38.220 --> 44:39.262
going to get anybody else hurt. We're pulling out. 
And that's what he did. So, let me ask you this

44:43.662 --> 44:46.707
question. Excuse me, as compared to a Lyndon 
Johnson, who is your typical and probably the

44:46.927 --> 44:58.807
master politician, he's the guy that really 
escalated the deal. He's the guy that wouldn't

44:59.168 --> 45:01.712
turn the military loose. And there was a 
construction company over there called RMKBRJ,

45:02.834 --> 45:09.585
and what it was was... was some initials for 
people, and what it really was, was a way for a

45:11.185 --> 45:20.875
construction company to go in there before, 
during, and after. These were the people that

45:20.935 --> 45:23.718
built all this stuff. And then after the war was 
over, they were going to have their foothold into

45:24.079 --> 45:33.629
building towns, cities, housing, everything. 
And then it was already set up, even when we pulled

45:33.989 --> 45:39.235
out, you know, that these are the guys, you know, 
they talk about the war reparations, you know,

45:39.687 --> 45:51.101
where, you know, you're supposed to pay us so much 
stuff for damages you did to our country, you know,

45:39.687 --> 45:51.101
that kind of stuff, and we haven't done that. And 
the reason we haven't done that is because

45:51.481 --> 46:00.692
politically it would be very hard for this country 
to give money to those people politically. See,

46:01.193 --> 46:04.076
and that's why they have MIAs that are over there. 
They have them by the hundreds. They're alive.

46:07.019 --> 46:08.021
They're still captive. They're still being 
tortured. And they're not going to give those

46:09.758 --> 46:16.646
people back to us until we pay those warp 
reparations. That's the deal. That's the real

46:18.088 --> 46:21.112
deal behind all this stuff. And they're going to 
sit there and hold them. They can wait a lot longer

46:23.134 --> 46:24.536
than we can. So our politicians are just saying, 
no, we just hear rumors of that, but there's been no

46:27.119 --> 46:34.147
real positive identifications. But yeah, we've 
had tourists. families who have been over there

46:36.877 --> 46:52.962
who have actually seen people, there's pictures 
of them, recent pictures, they're alive and

46:36.877 --> 46:52.962
they're there and our government's not doing 
anything

46:36.877 --> 46:52.962
about it. About that question I asked you, did you 
feel that we were justified in going over there?

46:59.633 --> 47:02.918
Well, of course you really, you know,

47:05.834 --> 47:17.212
I feel like that the people who went over there were 
more than justified because, in my opinion, your

47:05.834 --> 47:17.212
country called, right, wrong, or indifferent, 
and you answered the call. Okay?
