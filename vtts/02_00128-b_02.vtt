WEBVTT

00:02.866 --> 00:09.936
Same opportunities any male cadet would have, as 
you say, being in the army, in the band and

00:02.866 --> 00:09.936
whatever. When Ms. Ingrass stepped up on the 
stage, obviously Dr. Miller recognized her. And

00:17.688 --> 00:25.560
when they called her, just before they called her 
name, he turned to me and he said, I'm not going to

00:17.688 --> 00:25.560
shake hands with her. And I said, Jarvis, I think 
that's a mistake. I think you should. You're

00:30.895 --> 00:38.948
representing Texas A&M and you need to do that to 
get your personal feelings about this." And she

00:38.968 --> 00:46.921
walked up and I handed him the diploma and he would 
not shake hands with her.

00:49.065 --> 00:51.288
And she didn't know what to do. She turned to me and

00:55.567 --> 00:57.329
Some people say I shook her hand. I can't remember 
if I did or I didn't. But anyway, I know it was an

00:59.671 --> 01:02.575
embarrassing moment. I think my recollection is 
that you did not and that you said to her, ma'am,

01:02.595 --> 01:13.766
this is not part of my responsibility, something 
like that. Okay. And my recollection is that Don

01:14.828 --> 01:19.853
Carter then said, ma'am, would you please keep the 
line moving? And so she walked on around. She

01:21.691 --> 01:24.455
walked on, and she was the last one. And her dean 
would have shaken hands with her at the exit of the

01:24.615 --> 01:29.903
stage, I think. And I remember some hissing from 
corps members as they saw her coming up on the

01:29.923 --> 01:36.432
stage. That, plus the fact that she's the last of 
the last of the last, causes everybody to stop and

01:37.093 --> 01:44.123
notice. All eyes were there, and all eyes saw what 
happened. Perfect. What reaction do you remember

01:48.352 --> 01:55.219
afterward in the Letterman's Lounge or anywhere 
else? Did you hear any comments? Oh, yes. Yes, I

01:57.522 --> 02:02.767
heard several comments that it was certainly not 
the proper thing to do. I always felt that that was a

02:04.269 --> 02:12.557
big factor in Dr. Miller's future. As I 
understand, when they summoned him over six weeks

02:12.738 --> 02:17.903
later, the boardroom after their executive 
session to tell him that he his presidency was

02:19.030 --> 02:30.429
ended but that's the first thing that they said to 
him. I don't know that. I do know I knew one of the

02:32.132 --> 02:42.068
board members rather well during that regime and I 
do know that that that was foremost in his mind,

02:42.740 --> 02:47.806
whether he was confronted with it at that 
particular time. He was confronted with it,

02:47.826 --> 02:58.119
whether that was the time that he happened over at 
the Ramada Inn,

02:47.826 --> 02:58.119
did he not? I believe. I think that's right. When he 
found out that he had been terminated, if I'm not

03:00.142 --> 03:08.913
mistaken, there was a cocktail party at the Ramada 
Inn, and that was when he learned about it. And now,

03:08.933 --> 03:12.477
in the Letterman's Lounge, right after that 
commencement, I heard a couple of board members

03:13.030 --> 03:17.116
mumbling in the other direction. I heard them 
saying, serves are right, should have, you know,

03:17.236 --> 03:20.902
serves are right. Well, they would have been from 
that particular group that we talked about

03:20.922 --> 03:28.813
earlier and wanted to take their Aggie rings off, 
and females were admitted to A&M. Right. Let's

03:30.836 --> 03:31.337
see.

03:34.101 --> 03:42.193
What are some things you remember happening that, 
now we're on positive, happening in the audience

03:34.101 --> 03:42.193
during commencements? Well,

03:42.713 --> 04:03.424
of course, I always

03:42.713 --> 04:03.424
truly enjoy hearing sometimes very loud and 
exciting responses from parents when their son or

03:42.713 --> 04:03.424
their daughter would walk across the stage. Such 
things as, you finally made it. Gee, Mama and I can

04:09.213 --> 04:11.877
enjoy a vacation. or things like that. Also, you 
heard a lot of funny responses and also saw some

04:13.872 --> 04:25.205
really interesting things with the type of signs 
that the candidates would put on top of their hats.

04:26.567 --> 04:27.288
Do you remember any? Oh, well, there was always 
needing a job or I'm for hire or those kind of things

04:29.290 --> 04:38.802
or hey, Mom, I did it. Hey, Dad, I did it or things 
like that. My favorite of all is one that said

04:42.704 --> 04:47.131
simply, hell froze over. That's

04:47.411 --> 04:51.418
good. That's good. Of the presidents that you 
observed at commencement, which ones did it best?

05:04.057 --> 05:04.918
It can be plural. I didn't say one, but one. I 
understand. You mean... The commencement

05:10.733 --> 05:12.976
ceremony. All their participation and 
everything. Well, Jack Williams was very smooth

05:18.123 --> 05:20.767
up there. He was a wonderful speaker. Frank 
Vandiver was a wonderful speaker. And I think, of

05:26.175 --> 05:35.307
course, you know Frank had a different, something 
that I'll always remember him by. He wore gloves

05:35.327 --> 05:39.373
when he shook hands with the students. And I think 
no other president did that, but he always had a

05:40.332 --> 05:46.000
glove on.

05:50.746 --> 05:56.094
Let's

05:50.746 --> 05:56.094
see. Okay. Who can't see? After Vandiver, we 
had... Mobley? Mobley.

06:06.588 --> 06:08.871
And then after Mobley, we had...

06:11.517 --> 06:13.639
Wait a minute, Mobley came. I never did work with 
Mobley, no. No, Dr. Vandiver was still there when I

06:16.782 --> 06:18.744
left. Yeah, he was there. I worked with, I worked 
with, well I worked with General Rutter, and I

06:19.604 --> 06:40.984
worked then with Ludeke, then Williams, then 
Jarvis, and then Chick, I mean the engineer. the

06:41.302 --> 06:44.906
interim president, Chuck Sampson. Dr. Sampson. I 
got the wrong ballot on there. I would say overall

06:48.710 --> 07:04.327
speaking, when you look at the, I mean all of them 
loved the congratulations and shaking hands with

06:48.710 --> 07:04.327
the students. I mean every one of them loved that. 
But overall speaking, if you look at all aspects of

07:06.952 --> 07:21.250
it, I think Dr. Williams and Dr. Vandiver really 
did a superb job. And I guess a lot of that has to do

07:21.270 --> 07:29.160
with those two gentlemen were outstanding 
speakers.

07:29.200 --> 07:30.522
They were both historians. They were both 
historians, exactly. All right. Dr. Williams has

07:36.668 --> 07:50.847
the heart attack and when he recovers and did, 
during that period Mr. Freeman was the interim.

07:51.668 --> 07:54.812
Did that make any changes in the way y'all 
operated? No. Okay. Then Williams comes back and

07:56.314 --> 08:05.005
the board then recreates the system 
administration and he They make him the

08:05.474 --> 08:10.004
chancellor and the board selects Dr. Miller as the 
president. Did that change?

08:14.574 --> 08:20.388
Are you speaking to graduation or are you speaking 
to the whole operation? No, I don't recall that it

08:20.408 --> 08:24.597
did at all.

08:27.496 --> 08:28.998
No, I don't. You and Ed and Don. We were still there. 
Dr. Miller seemed to be pleased with what we were

08:31.340 --> 08:36.687
doing. Dr. Miller was very instrumental in 
getting us the space over in Heaton Hall and

08:38.429 --> 08:55.408
getting us moved in there, of course, which was 
certainly

08:38.429 --> 08:55.408
something that was overdue for us because we'd 
gotten so crowded. When did we really start?

08:57.247 --> 09:08.001
electronic computing in the whole registrar 
operations?

09:08.021 --> 09:09.242
Well, let's see. In about, we had some terminals 
when we were still in the Koch building.

09:18.033 --> 09:25.583
I would say about 1970, 72, 73,

09:26.137 --> 09:32.343
We really started getting our equipment and that 
sort of thing. By the time we got into Heaton, we

09:32.363 --> 09:41.032
almost had a terminal for everybody who needed 
one. Today, ten years ago when I left there, at that

09:41.612 --> 09:55.266
time we had accomplished where every faculty 
member had a

09:41.612 --> 09:55.266
terminal by 1988. I am very comfortable with the 
fact that I set out to do something that I thought

09:56.073 --> 10:09.539
was so needed, and that was to automate that 
system, and it accomplished it. I feel very

10:09.559 --> 10:19.077
comfortable, and I'm very appreciative of people 
like Chuck McCandless, who was a big proponent for

10:09.559 --> 10:19.077
us. Well, you know, all of our people in the vice 
president's offices always found the VP and the

10:19.698 --> 10:38.425
provost to be very generous with us and give us most 
of the time what we asked for. And computing cost a

10:38.765 --> 10:41.649
lot of money. I mean, it took a ton of money to put 
this online system up and this touch home

10:41.769 --> 10:47.798
registration. Haskalawa

10:48.402 --> 10:57.073
always viewed a registrar's office as being an 
academic service unit. Sure. That's what it is.

10:59.116 --> 11:04.243
Academic service for the students, the staff, and 
the faculty. And it costs money to deliver those

11:04.263 --> 11:08.048
kinds of things. I just think today how wonderful 
it is that a faculty member can sit there in their

11:08.770 --> 11:18.361
office and through a terminal they can know 
everything they need to know about a student's

11:08.770 --> 11:18.361
board of the academic program. They don't have to 
have all these files and folders and all that sort

11:18.381 --> 11:22.486
of stuff. Where did you turn as you were trying to 
make this conversion? To what institution or

11:26.911 --> 11:30.255
corporation did you turn for? for advice and 
counsel? Well, the first people that I contacted

11:31.997 --> 11:44.115
when I was speaking earlier, when I first started 
to get this out of Savisa Hall and going to this

11:31.997 --> 11:44.115
pre-registration plan was Purdue. And I spent 
many hours at Purdue just trying to see if what they

11:44.135 --> 11:56.213
were doing would fit the Texas A&M. The thing that 
we were always able to do here, There were a lot of

11:59.463 --> 12:11.555
schools throughout the country that were giving 
what I call a partial registration opportunity to

11:59.463 --> 12:11.555
a student. And that would be, most of them were 
doing nothing but scheduling their academic

12:11.575 --> 12:15.719
classes. And they would get their bill in the mail, 
and then they'd have to go all over campus to the

12:16.380 --> 12:25.369
police, to the library, to the ticket office where 
to pay all this stuff. And I didn't see that that was

12:32.715 --> 12:34.797
helping us any. Because after all, even in a field 
house registration like we had at Sabisa Dining

12:35.018 --> 12:44.629
Hall, when a kid walked out that back door, he was 
through, or she. They could pay all their fees and

12:44.649 --> 12:49.034
everything in one deal. So I wanted that same thing 
electronically done. So we were able to do that

12:54.813 --> 13:01.080
through our early pre-registration system, 
although it still wasn't what I wanted. And then

13:01.540 --> 13:21.883
when touch-tone came in and the telephone 
industry upgraded and we were able to transmit all

13:01.540 --> 13:21.883
this data by means of the phone line, Brigham Young 
had the first touch-tone registration system. So

13:22.808 --> 13:25.832
I went out there and spent quite a bit of time with 
them. But as it would have it, they were doing

13:26.593 --> 13:32.701
nothing but the academic schedule. A student 
would get on the phone, key in, and they'd get their

13:32.721 --> 13:38.649
schedule mailed to them. But when they got their 
schedule, they'd still have to go back on campus

13:38.709 --> 13:47.201
and go buy their tickets, their athletic tickets, 
their dining and all that. They still had four or

13:47.341 --> 13:50.385
five different places they had to go to. So I wasn't 
satisfied. I was satisfied with the academic

13:51.949 --> 13:56.635
schedule, but I wasn't satisfied with it. It was 
not complete. So Texas A&M was the first

13:59.458 --> 14:13.874
institution in the country that gave a student the 
complete registration process by means of Texas

13:59.458 --> 14:13.874
A&M. And also to be the size that it was. Do you 
remember what year that was? Well, let's see.

14:22.698 --> 14:30.406
We started that committee in about 84,

14:22.698 --> 14:30.406
which I was chairman of. And we had that thing 
completely implemented by, I'm going to say about

14:32.708 --> 14:40.836
1987. It was up and running at least a year and a year 
and a half before I left. Now there have been a lot of

14:46.402 --> 14:51.827
things added to it since then that we had planned at 
that time. This automated degree program that we

14:52.145 --> 14:58.432
talked about earlier had come in since then, but we 
had that in our package. That was all part of our

14:58.452 --> 14:59.834
plan. But I guess the greatest compliment that I 
ever had relative to Touchstone registration was

15:00.895 --> 15:13.630
one day after Christmas when we started back for 
the spring semester. A phone call came in, and this

15:13.650 --> 15:21.679
guy got on the phone, and he said, Mr. Lacey, I'm 
so-and-so, class of whatever it was, in the 50s.

15:26.010 --> 15:32.997
And he said, I just want to tell you how wonderful it 
is that my daughter could register while she was at

15:26.010 --> 15:32.997
home. It did it by telephone. He said, I'm one of the 
people that walked through Sabisa Dining Hall. I

15:39.323 --> 15:41.765
said, well, I know what you're comparing it to 
then. And he said, it's just great. He said, we want

15:45.468 --> 15:48.191
to express our appreciation to you. And I said, 
well, thank you very much. We appreciate your

15:50.173 --> 15:51.514
call. He said, don't you want to know where I'm 
calling from? I said, well, where are you calling

15:55.303 --> 15:56.884
from? He said, London, England. Oh, my goodness, 
how good. So I said, hey, wonderful. And truly, if

16:04.152 --> 16:08.357
you have a touchstone phone, you can register from 
anywhere in the world. I remember our son, our

16:08.377 --> 16:17.627
number four, doing it from Columbia, Missouri one 
semester, and he got exactly what he wanted. Then

16:18.748 --> 16:21.231
the next day he decided he wanted to change the 
schedule. I'm going to change some hours. He got on

16:23.439 --> 16:26.502
the phone and in less than 30 minutes. He had it 
done. He had it all done entirely differently. And

16:30.085 --> 16:31.286
it suited his fancy. And I thought that if you can 
have that student walk into class the first day

16:31.907 --> 16:44.139
feeling comparatively optimistic about the 
hour, the course, the instructor. In other words,

16:44.159 --> 16:45.600
they selected it. Correct. There's a chance for it 
being better. Got to be happy. Yeah. Got to be

16:48.923 --> 16:49.564
happy. And see, the other wonderful thing about 
that too, Haskell, which you saw, or you would

16:50.388 --> 17:07.503
appreciate this, being a faculty member, that 
roster, if that faculty member got that first

16:50.388 --> 17:07.503
morning, that first day of class, was absolutely 
excellent. Oh yeah, because it was all real time,

17:07.523 --> 17:18.133
and if a kid decided he wanted to drop a course on 
Sunday night, before we printed those things, His

17:18.721 --> 17:24.267
name was off the list.

17:24.548 --> 17:47.614
And

17:24.548 --> 17:47.614
you know, back to what I said earlier about being, 
when I was a student here, having those two places

17:24.548 --> 17:47.614
that I wanted to do something about, the 
registrar's office and the fiscal office, I think

17:24.548 --> 17:47.614
we've made a lot of progress there because It took 
me a while to get the fiscal people to come along,

17:47.982 --> 17:52.168
but I did. And they agreed to automate all of the 
finances and the student bills and that sort of

17:52.228 --> 18:00.540
thing. I wasn't going to put it in unless I could get 
that because I felt like we need to give the student

18:00.620 --> 18:08.692
complete registration. And as a result, I 
understand today that they've automated a lot.

18:14.678 --> 18:21.107
You don't see the green jade in the fiscal

18:14.678 --> 18:21.107
office. Looking back, what are the key decisions 
that affected the registrar's operation that you

18:21.608 --> 18:35.409
can think of that now, in hindsight, were key 
decisions? Plus or minus?

18:41.838 --> 18:43.200
Well,

18:47.973 --> 18:59.007
And I don't know,

18:47.973 --> 18:59.007
I have to be a little bit personal about what I do 
when I say what I'm fixing to say. We raised the

19:00.790 --> 19:08.520
Office of Admissions and Records to a higher level 
than it was when I came in. And I don't want to be

19:08.880 --> 19:14.908
critical about that.

19:15.378 --> 19:23.410
And there were people like you and McKinley that we 
worked with that helped us do that. We gained some

19:24.271 --> 19:29.379
position on the campus. I think we were looked on in 
the earlier years, as I said, as a necessary evil,

19:29.840 --> 19:38.273
just thorn in everybody's side. And I wanted to 
change that image to show that we were a service

19:42.108 --> 19:44.610
unit, an academic service unit. We wanted to work 
with the people out there. And I think people like

19:48.374 --> 20:09.634
John Calhoun and Williams who supported and 
recognized that we needed to be, and Ed Cooper, Ed

19:48.374 --> 20:09.634
Cooper had a lot to do with it, to get us up there 
where we were recognized and we were heard and we

19:48.374 --> 20:09.634
had a say in things that were important to Texas A&M 
University. such as classroom utilization. I

20:12.317 --> 20:26.613
mean, you know, they were building buildings up 
there and not asking anybody any questions at all

20:12.317 --> 20:26.613
long before Chuck McCandlish got there, you know, 
and where we had then some data to say, hey, don't

20:12.317 --> 20:26.613
come in here and tell me you need another history 
building or another English building. Let me show

20:26.633 --> 20:28.495
you right now what you're not using. We couldn't do 
that. It was again back to that similar type of

20:30.558 --> 20:34.322
attitude Well, I need to teach my class in this 
building. Well, we need a new building for

20:36.777 --> 20:42.129
mechanical engineering just because we need a new 
building for mechanical engineering. And

20:42.149 --> 20:45.696
there's a lot of politics and all that, and you and I 
focused on that. But I think we got

20:45.716 --> 20:51.889
administrations to recognize these people. are 
necessary in the management of this university,

20:52.409 --> 21:04.946
and they've got a lot of data over there that can be 
very helpful to us in making some critical

20:52.409 --> 21:04.946
decisions before we go out here to Hawthorne and 
start asking for money. And so, and I think a lot of

21:05.267 --> 21:21.589
that has to do with personality, you know, and 
being able to sit down and I guess one of the things

21:05.267 --> 21:21.589
that I always respected about our administration 
here, always felt like that if you could get in

21:22.058 --> 21:28.207
there, and once we got to that level, get in there, 
they would listen to you. And you could make your

21:28.227 --> 21:30.731
point. And, you know, if it was legitimate, I mean, 
I never felt like that I went down and asked them for

21:30.751 --> 21:40.545
something that wasn't necessary. I learned that a 
long, long time ago. That, you know, I feel like

21:42.929 --> 21:49.078
that we as employees of public institutions that 
have tax dollars that are we're responsible for

21:50.358 --> 22:19.268
need to be responsible for and need to be uh you know 
not here just asking because i mean am in my whole

21:50.358 --> 22:19.268
career in texas a m university never once did i ever 
feel that we didn't have the money to do something

21:50.358 --> 22:19.268
no we were always told a lot of stuff but that's fine 
good But I just felt, I feel like, and I think one of

22:19.568 --> 22:48.698
the big things that really is a factor there when we 
were able to say, hey, let us schedule these

22:19.568 --> 22:48.698
classes and let us show you what kind of classroom 
utilization we can come out with, was a big

22:19.568 --> 22:48.698
decision that helped us. There were many others. 
One thing that I was always blessed with my job up

22:53.491 --> 23:06.403
there, and maybe it's kind of hard for me to answer 
your question,

22:53.491 --> 23:06.403
I have to assume that we did a good job because 
nobody was ever pushing us. I mean, really. You

23:09.406 --> 23:18.735
know,

23:09.406 --> 23:18.735
the 26 years I worked there, I never, ever had for 
one major money in the domain capital of my life.

23:23.467 --> 23:24.869
You said one time. Can you? Dr. Wernert. And Dr. 
Wernert and I are good friends today. And I think it

23:31.216 --> 23:42.929
was maybe because, you know, I mean, it was just a 
point of... And if he were sitting in that room,

23:31.216 --> 23:42.929
he'd say, well, hey, you know, it shouldn't have 
ever happened. But I feel... I just always felt

23:47.065 --> 23:57.397
that we were honest and honorable, forthright in 
what we were coming in there to ask people about,

23:47.065 --> 23:57.397
and most of the time they supported us. And that's a 
compliment on both sides, to them and to me.

24:02.744 --> 24:05.948
Proudest moments? Some events you can remember 
and say, ooh, yeah, yeah.

24:14.518 --> 24:16.060
Well, we were extremely proud. when we got into our 
new facility over there. I mean, that was, you

24:20.153 --> 24:27.943
know, we had a building now that belonged, I don't 
want to be talking about both sides of my mouth when

24:20.153 --> 24:27.943
I say belonged to us. I don't mean it in the sense 
that I talked about earlier, but we had space. We

24:32.730 --> 24:33.791
had adequate space. And another proud moment was 
when it had again to do with the registration, was

24:34.873 --> 24:44.325
when they came and said, hey, here's a pavilion, be 
with it. And I was the project coordinator on that

24:44.795 --> 24:47.419
building. Dying it like a wound. Now who made the 
decision not to tear that down, but to save it?

24:55.090 --> 24:56.291
Because there had to be somebody. Yeah, there was. 
Well, let's see. Was McCandless still here?

25:04.583 --> 25:04.924
McCandless? Oh yes. Oh yeah, McCandless was here 
then. Yes. I was trying to think who the president

25:09.731 --> 25:12.895
would have been then, I guess.

25:16.874 --> 25:17.555
Was it Miller? No. Wasn't Miller? No. Because I'm 
still here. You're still here. Okay. And it's

25:23.985 --> 25:25.848
after me. I think so. Okay, and it's after you? I 
think so. So it's... Would you leave 80? 80. So it's

25:32.218 --> 25:34.261
Chuck Sampson or Vanderer, I guess.

25:38.708 --> 25:39.609
You know, that's what I'm... I'm sorry. I'm 
completely lapsed on that. I... I know I worked

25:44.498 --> 25:46.862
with Chuck on that thing, you know. Of course, 
Chuck was also involved in that, uh, uh, well, no,

25:46.882 --> 25:57.079
he left, though, Danny, when he, when he left 
Provost Office, he and, he and Eaton went to Iowa

25:46.882 --> 25:57.079
State. Iowa State, didn't they? Well, I'll have 
to, let me, let me see if I can get a, get a little more

26:00.545 --> 26:04.151
information. I may be some fill-in I'll do for you 
when we get there. Other proud moments you recall?

26:09.060 --> 26:09.240
Uh,

26:20.307 --> 26:36.384
Well, I've already talked about this some, but the 
proudest of my whole administration up there was

26:20.307 --> 26:36.384
the institution of the student automated 
records. I don't know where we are today. I suspect

26:38.847 --> 26:46.095
we're still at the top, but we were at the top then, 
and we should be there now. And, you know, I mean, I

26:46.362 --> 26:54.572
can remember high school when it took a kid three, 
four weeks to get a transcript after the grade

26:46.362 --> 26:54.572
turned in. They're getting them now the next day, 
you know. And they're in the mail and gone. And

27:00.258 --> 27:07.687
that's just, in my business, that's very, very 
important. And I know we're miles ahead of what a

27:07.707 --> 27:11.051
lot of schools do. All right. If you could go back, 
are there anything Is there anything or things

27:15.826 --> 27:20.732
you'd like, wish you could change, given 
hindsight?

27:28.060 --> 27:28.320
No. And I'll tell you why, again, why I feel that 
way. I feel that way because

27:33.026 --> 27:42.096
I've only had two jobs in my entire lifetime. One of 
them was the Cypress Firebanks and the rest of them

27:42.116 --> 27:45.360
was the Texas A&M. But I can also tell you this. I was 
very close nationwide to my colleagues in this

27:49.752 --> 27:55.699
business. When I was much younger in this field, I 
went to all of those national meetings, and I

27:56.319 --> 28:04.669
stayed very much up to date on all of them. And I came 
home time after time after time, thinking,

28:09.472 --> 28:18.681
everybody that I could think that had given me my 
job at that time, because I would not have been

28:09.472 --> 28:18.681
employed in those schools. Not only because of the 
way, necessarily of the lack of facilities, or the

28:18.701 --> 28:29.911
lack of money, or the lack of poor administration, 
or the student body. The student body probably

28:30.512 --> 28:33.394
comes first. We've got, had, in my lifetime, the 
best student body in the world. And if you recall,

28:41.348 --> 29:00.311
when all the upheaval was going on in Kent State and 
other places across the country, one day, I looked

28:41.348 --> 29:00.311
out my window and I caught

28:41.348 --> 29:00.311
this group of students out around Southern. And 
this was during the time when the moratoriums were

29:00.331 --> 29:03.515
going and all that stuff, Vietnam. I walked over 
there just to see. very friendly discussion going

29:07.437 --> 29:19.570
on between the cowboys and the cadet corps on one 
side and the few hippies we had on the other side.

29:19.590 --> 29:28.480
But what they had to say, I enjoyed listening to 
because they both were making third points and

29:19.590 --> 29:28.480
they were decent about it. And it was ended and it 
was gone. You know, we didn't have students

29:36.125 --> 29:46.114
walking in the president's office and grabbing 
him by the tie and throwing him out in the hall and

29:36.125 --> 29:46.114
locking and taking over and all that kind of stuff. 
So, and then having the kind of administrators

29:46.134 --> 30:02.430
that we had that supported us and listened to us and 
the student body we had and all the wonderful

29:46.134 --> 30:02.430
people that we had around us to work with. I'll go 
back through it again and we'll change things.

30:06.162 --> 30:07.684
Okay, we're getting close to the end. Let's make 
believe that somebody walked up to you and handed

30:08.265 --> 30:28.850
you a check for a lot of money, and we'll say six 
figures at least, and say, here, you can give this

30:08.265 --> 30:28.850
to Texas A&M, and you can specify what unit, what 
part of the university it's going to go to. What

30:29.631 --> 30:30.432
would that do?

30:35.896 --> 30:37.358
Well, I'm big on scholarships. For what? Needy. 
Regardless of their major? Needy students,

30:43.286 --> 30:47.292
regardless of their major. I believe very 
strongly in everybody having an opportunity for

30:47.452 --> 30:53.941
an education.

30:56.965 --> 30:59.288
And then I also think that certain amounts of it 
would be necessary to cut to research. That may

31:05.258 --> 31:12.868
sound a little bit strange coming from me, but I do 
know how valuable research is. I think sometimes

31:13.028 --> 31:17.894
maybe we get a little overboard on it. That's just a 
personal opinion. But I think it's extremely

31:20.036 --> 31:25.022
important.

31:27.466 --> 31:35.524
I would have difficulty in putting it into 
buildings and that sort of thing because I think

31:27.466 --> 31:35.524
that's what the state of Texas should be doing. But 
I would put it into that.
