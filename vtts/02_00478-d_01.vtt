WEBVTT

00:01.938 --> 00:04.445
an interview with General H.O. Johnson, Jr., 
Brigadier General, United States Air Force,

00:04.525 --> 00:09.178
retired. Today's date is July 15, 1981. This is 
Terry Anderson.

00:24.905 --> 00:30.033
This is our second interview with General 
Johnson, Brigadier General, United States Air

00:24.905 --> 00:30.033
Force, retired. Today is July 15th, 1981. This is 
Terry Anderson. And last time we were talking

00:34.299 --> 00:41.951
about your job in Great Britain as the Director of 
Project Management of the Third Air Force. And you

00:42.592 --> 00:48.601
had written down a couple of things there that you 
wanted to talk about that you said were rather

00:42.592 --> 00:48.601
interesting about that job. And then a tape ran 
out. Okay.

01:02.384 --> 01:16.844
I think we had talked

01:02.384 --> 01:16.844
about Project Red Richard and the move of 
certainly the nuclear force from France over to

01:02.384 --> 01:16.844
England.

01:23.653 --> 01:30.703
At the time that I was forecasted to leave England 
and return to the United States, an alert came

01:31.966 --> 01:39.900
through that I was going to be reassigned to the 
ROTC program. And when I approached my

01:41.502 --> 01:56.067
supervisor, who was then Colonel Frank Collins, 
he suggested that if I knew anybody in the higher

01:57.042 --> 02:09.399
echelons of the personnel business that I contact 
them, and he would contact the top civil engineer

01:57.042 --> 02:09.399
who was Major General Minton and see if we couldn't 
do something about that. Well, sure enough, the

02:09.499 --> 02:26.863
three-star general who was in charge of personnel 
at the time was named Clark, and he happened to be

02:09.499 --> 02:26.863
the wing commander at Chaumont, where I had some 
three or four years earlier, served as his

02:27.687 --> 02:32.995
resident engineer. And it seemed that, yes, the 
assignment to ROTC was stopped, and Clark and

02:34.417 --> 02:50.140
Minton

02:34.417 --> 02:50.140
made the decision for me to come to the Pentagon. I 
was then in a dilemma because I didn't know which

02:51.101 --> 02:54.927
would be the lesser of two evils to go back to ROTC or 
to go to the Pentagon because it was my desire to try

02:55.193 --> 03:05.323
to stay as close to engineering as I could for 
another few years. I didn't have any idea what I

03:07.905 --> 03:12.189
might get into in the Pentagon. So it happened that 
I was assigned as chief of the master planning

03:12.210 --> 03:23.040
branch of civil engineering at headquarters US 
Air Force.

03:31.723 --> 03:35.948
It was a very enlightening assignment that I held 
for three years. From 1960 to 1963, but before we

03:36.569 --> 03:48.184
get to that job, sir, I'd like to ask you one 
question about Red Richard and about storing

03:36.569 --> 03:48.184
nuclear weapons in the United Kingdom. Our first 
Polaris submarines were reaching England by 1960

03:48.839 --> 04:04.705
and there was a little bit of anti-nuclear weapon 
protests from some factions in the British Maybe

04:04.955 --> 04:13.948
later on, and I was wondering if any of this, if you 
had any anti-neutro demonstrations, do you

04:04.955 --> 04:13.948
remember any of this or your feelings on that? 
Well, I remember it vividly because it's strange

04:14.268 --> 04:34.236
that you would bring it up without any prompting at 
all, but I was given a special assignment for a week

04:14.268 --> 04:34.236
or ten days to accompany two Navy commanders as we 
surveyed bases in Scotland and Ireland that had

04:34.688 --> 04:40.656
been made available to us by the British. And since 
the Air Force was the point of contact with the

04:41.657 --> 04:50.128
British, it was our job to put somebody with them. 
And the three of us went to some 10 or 12 bases that

04:50.148 --> 05:00.882
the British had made available to us to store the 
nuclear weapons for the Polaris. The three of us

05:01.199 --> 05:06.785
were the ones that actually made the decision to 
put them in Scotland. And there they still are, for

05:06.865 --> 05:15.054
that matter. Now,

05:16.135 --> 05:29.890
as far as the people that were anti were the 
minority, most of the people in Scotland, kind of

05:30.443 --> 05:37.895
looked upon it as a blessing in disguise because it 
was more employment that other people would have.

05:39.918 --> 05:48.351
We ended up

05:39.918 --> 05:48.351
in a later assignment I don't know what the dates, 
you got the dates, when I went back there in 68. 68 to

05:52.199 --> 05:55.222
70. And built a number of houses. We built some 200 
houses in Scotland just to support that force.

06:02.890 --> 06:08.396
Those houses were actually not US owned, but 
British owned and leased to us. So when I say

06:08.416 --> 06:15.604
British, Scottish is probably a better term to use 
than Scotland.

06:16.327 --> 06:22.813
We didn't really feel any hard feelings from the 
people. Was this done spectacularized by the

06:22.853 --> 06:26.876
media, that some of these protests? Oh, it always 
is, sure.

06:32.701 --> 06:34.903
Okay, I was wondering about that. Okay, now let's 
move to Washington, D.C., and tell me about life in

06:36.285 --> 06:42.950
the Pentagon. Well, life in the Pentagon is... 
It's a peculiar life. If

06:48.818 --> 07:01.939
there's anything that's different from the 
military, it's probably life in the Pentagon,

06:48.818 --> 07:01.939
because you work at different hours. You work 
strange hours,

07:01.979 --> 07:10.853
erratic hours, unless you are fortunate enough to 
be of a real high rank, and therefore given one of

07:11.677 --> 07:20.788
the few sets of quarters that are available to 
support the Pentagon. You live on the economy. And

07:23.912 --> 07:28.077
you make your own private and social life. And 
very, very little of it is associated with the

07:28.257 --> 07:33.684
military. You are nothing more than just another 
person living in the Washington area. you may or

07:39.689 --> 07:44.115
may not live in a neighborhood where there are 
other military people. Certainly there's going

07:46.378 --> 07:53.848
to be other people working for the federal 
government, because I guess 60, 70% of them in that

07:46.378 --> 07:53.848
area do work for the federal government. But other 
than the fact that you are in either the

07:53.868 --> 08:06.625
headquarters of the Army, Navy, Air Force, 
Marines, or Department of Defense, Most of the

08:07.887 --> 08:19.825
time you even wear civilian clothes, and it 
doesn't take long to begin to feel that we're in the

08:07.887 --> 08:19.825
world that the military go.

08:22.328 --> 08:33.625
I found the three years to be a very

08:22.328 --> 08:33.625
enlightening three years, both politically, 
professionally,

08:35.292 --> 08:44.243
travel-wide and everything else because of some 
of the work that we did during the three-year

08:35.292 --> 08:44.243
period.

08:46.906 --> 09:01.283
The one that drew me in closest association with

08:46.906 --> 09:01.283
the other services was

08:46.906 --> 09:01.283
the Army, Navy, and Air Force and Marines had 
different agencies and organizations scattered

09:01.651 --> 09:11.605
all over the District of Columbia. They also had, 
at that time, quarters for enlisted personnel of

09:11.625 --> 09:24.102
the unmarried type scattered all over the area. 
And the Department of Defense took it upon

09:24.122 --> 09:28.148
themselves start a project of consolidating to 
try to cut back on the amount of space required

09:28.803 --> 09:58.759
which would also generate a dollar savings and

09:28.803 --> 09:58.759
one of us from each of the four services was placed 
on the committee and we worked for some six or eight

09:28.803 --> 09:58.759
months on the project constantly briefing the 
local congressmen, that is those from Virginia

09:59.026 --> 10:18.664
and Maryland, how it would affect them as well as 
briefing the House Armed Service Committee what

09:59.026 --> 10:18.664
we were doing to the defense establishment in the 
District of Columbia. And it did result in a

10:18.804 --> 10:27.092
considerable consolidation and a little more 
effective planning for the future because all

10:27.798 --> 10:41.532
four services were going their own way rather than 
cooperating with each other and sharing space or

10:27.798 --> 10:41.532
making surplus space available to the other 
service. And so did you actually establish? Yes.

10:45.155 --> 10:46.056
What was the name of that? Well, it was known as the 
Washington Consolidation Plan. And part of that

10:50.841 --> 10:56.286
plan actually closed Naval Air Station Anacostia 
and placed that Navy personnel was there in the

10:56.755 --> 11:10.314
facilities over on Boeing, which gave up part of 
the Anacostia base. The only thing that stayed on

11:10.434 --> 11:19.306
Anacostia was a Marine detachment that was 
charged with the emergency evacuation of the

11:10.434 --> 11:19.306
President and his family out of the White House. 
That installation where their helicopter stayed

11:23.215 --> 11:31.722
But everything else in Anacostia moved off and was 
consolidated to other locations. And what was the

11:31.742 --> 11:33.944
end result? Well, the end result, of course, was a 
dollar saving and a more effective future

11:33.964 --> 11:45.133
planning by just cutting back one installation in 
Anacostia and the D.C. area. Because that land had

11:46.875 --> 11:53.020
been turned back to other public use, taken out of 
the defense inventory. Was also the result of a new

11:53.759 --> 11:59.572
agency that was a centralized planning agency? 
No, it was not. Why not? Well, there's no reason to

12:01.977 --> 12:07.249
establish an agency that the Department of 
Defense is already responsible for. Okay, so it's

12:07.590 --> 12:10.536
all... Now, is this... At the same time, of course, 
there were other consolidations going on in the

12:11.377 --> 12:17.745
military. For example, the rise of the Defense 
Intelligence Agency, in which they took the

12:18.125 --> 12:26.876
Defense Intelligence Agency from all three 
services and put them into one in Washington. Does

12:27.417 --> 12:33.364
this seem like it's part of a pattern, then, to 
consolidate and streamline the military during

12:27.417 --> 12:33.364
the early 1960s? Well, yes, it was. Of course, when 
the DIA was formed, They didn't require new

12:39.052 --> 12:40.934
quarters. They went into existing army quarters 
that were over in Maryland.

12:49.381 --> 13:08.738
Now the task that was assigned to the master 
planning branch that I found the most interesting

12:49.381 --> 13:08.738
as far as just the Air Force was concerned and what 
constantly had me before committees of Congress

12:49.381 --> 13:08.738
was a program known as the Access Road Program.

13:17.684 --> 13:33.426
Each year, the different services request from 
the Congress an appropriation to

13:17.684 --> 13:33.426
support roads that are contiguous to their 
installations that are used not only by the their

13:34.165 --> 13:59.869
people on the installations but by the public such 
as roads that would lead to randolph air force base

13:34.165 --> 13:59.869
or roads that would lead to bergstrom and what 
improvements need to be made to those roads to

13:34.165 --> 13:59.869
carry the traffic actually the cost is born by the 
the service concern the big thing at that time of

14:00.490 --> 14:30.480
course is we were now installing the Minuteman 
missiles and this required miles and miles and

14:00.490 --> 14:30.480
miles of road improvements to carry the 
transporter erector of the Minuteman from the

14:00.490 --> 14:30.480
storage depot to the silo or the location that the 
Minuteman would be placed in which the Minuteman

14:00.490 --> 14:30.480
would be placed. Malmstrom Air Force Base was our 
first installation and we improved thousands of

14:31.253 --> 14:51.726
miles of road in Montana and all these roads had to 
be traveled with Bureau of Public Road People and

14:31.253 --> 14:51.726
state people determined whether or not the road 
was sufficient to carry Well, the first thing we

14:51.892 --> 14:54.995
had to do was... You had to turn weight? I beg your 
pardon? Because of the vehicle's weight? Not only

14:57.038 --> 15:00.261
weight, but also such thing as the turning rate of 
it. So the first thing we had to do was to go out to the

15:00.622 --> 15:18.622
plant where they were making the transporter 
erector and fully load one and put it through its

15:00.622 --> 15:18.622
paces and measure everything to see what it took to 
turn it and to back it up and so on, on public roads.

15:18.982 --> 15:20.464
Once it got on the installation, handle that, or 
into the small square, which was Air Force

15:20.900 --> 15:26.327
property. But on the public roads, we had to 
increase the radius on many, many square turn out

15:26.387 --> 15:39.245
there, where in that part of the country, most of 
the roads follow league lines. And they're pretty

15:39.365 --> 15:50.400
square as compared to our part of the country, 
where roads run diagonal curve down in this part of

15:39.365 --> 15:50.400
Texas. This

15:51.190 --> 16:17.772
Access Road Program became so

15:51.190 --> 16:17.772
much more visible during this period that

16:19.945 --> 16:32.097
with or without my consent, and at that time they 
didn't ask people in my grade if they incurred in

16:19.945 --> 16:32.097
certain things, they just said this is the way it's 
going to be done. When I moved from that position to

16:32.117 --> 16:48.332
Chief of the Master Planning Branch to the next one 
that I had, which was in the office of the Secretary

16:32.117 --> 16:48.332
of the Air Force, they also transferred the 
responsibility of the coordination of access

16:32.117 --> 16:48.332
roads from the master planning branch to the 
office that I transferred to. And I kept that same

16:52.884 --> 16:56.289
thing the whole time that I was there. Was that 
because of the quality of job you were doing? I

16:59.032 --> 16:59.473
don't know. One would like to think so. But I became 
known as Access Road Johnson. The staff knew me as

17:06.763 --> 17:10.067
such. If I went in to put on a briefing, will 
everybody immediately assume that it was on

17:10.452 --> 17:16.340
access roads? It may not necessarily have been, 
but I had the full knowledge of the access roads and

17:16.380 --> 17:30.680
the ear of a couple of the congressmen who followed 
it constantly because of the dollars that we were

17:16.380 --> 17:30.680
spending. Who were these congressmen? Harry 
Shepard from California was probably the leading

17:32.522 --> 17:36.207
one. chairman of the subcommittee of House 
Appropriations. That's where we, of course,

17:41.551 --> 17:45.817
derive our money in. But each, as you can imagine, 
Montana is not a very big state. And I don't even

17:52.708 --> 17:56.433
know how many congressmen they have. But every 
time we go into an area, naturally, if we're going

17:56.474 --> 18:05.367
to do anything to public roads in a congressional 
district, The congressman wanted to know about it

18:05.819 --> 18:10.924
and would have preferred to even make the 
announcement. Sometimes that was a little

18:11.985 --> 18:15.829
difficult because we were moving faster than 
that. But most of the time, we could cooperate with

18:16.970 --> 18:21.855
him and say, OK, here's what we're going to do. 
We're going to improve the roads from here to here.

18:25.518 --> 18:26.859
So they wanted the publicity. Sure. They may or may 
not have had anything to do with it, but any time a

18:29.002 --> 18:35.708
congressman can tell his home constituents 
something, he gets some credit, whether he

18:36.127 --> 18:41.396
deserves it or not. So it was back and forth from 
what we call the Pentagon to up on the hill, and

18:41.416 --> 18:48.509
constantly keeping them. And many, many trips to 
the field, again, there were public road people

18:54.149 --> 18:59.797
and state road people and so on because we couldn't 
touch the road. We could not let the contract on the

18:59.957 --> 19:04.163
road because they're a public road. We provide the 
money and we provide the criteria. This is what

19:07.888 --> 19:12.054
it's got to be raised to in order that we can move it 
across. Did you have any problems or was this

19:12.875 --> 19:14.938
carried out? The biggest problem that I had in it, I 
was then in the secretary's office and I was

19:15.939 --> 19:22.468
working for A Deputy Assistant Secretary for Air 
Force installation named Alan McCone, a

19:23.545 --> 19:34.999
gentleman from Pennsylvania, happens to be 
deceased, but now. But the cost of the

19:37.622 --> 19:52.860
improvements of the access roads in Missouri got 
to be such a, estimated to be at such a terrific

19:37.622 --> 19:52.860
level that was going to cost four to five times what 
we had originally estimated and our estimates had

19:53.296 --> 20:19.877
been based on what it had cost in other locations 
but missouri doesn't have the same type of road

19:53.296 --> 20:19.877
base and soils and everything else that malmstrom 
has for instance and we had carried our problem to

19:53.296 --> 20:19.877
the

20:22.760 --> 20:32.793
powers to be in the Air Force, and a decision was 
made that we would probably relocate the

20:22.760 --> 20:32.793
Minuteman wing to another area. And it fell my 
boss's job, Alan McCone, to go tell Senator

20:34.736 --> 20:46.491
Symington that the Minuteman was not going to be 
located in Missouri. This is the same as signing

20:46.531 --> 20:52.699
your own death warrant, because Symington was not 
only a leader of the Senate, but he was also a former

20:53.405 --> 20:59.232
Secretary of the Air Force. And Mr. McCone chose 
not to go alone, but Colonel Johnson was going to go

20:59.252 --> 21:06.841
with him and explain why. Can you tell me about 
that? Well, it was interesting. And what year was

21:11.808 --> 21:12.589
this? This is 19...

21:16.895 --> 21:18.637
into the Secretary's office. This would be 
between 1963 and 68. Well, it would be immediately

21:21.379 --> 21:30.887
before Kennedy's assassination because with the 
assassination, McCone tendered his

21:21.379 --> 21:30.887
resignation. He was a political appointee. So it 
would be about October of 1963. This was of the

21:36.692 --> 21:45.940
party and looked like there would be peace and 
harmony in the party, but that's not always so.

21:46.713 --> 21:50.417
Simon can sit and listen. He listened to McCone 
make the preamble. He listened to part of my

21:52.520 --> 22:03.373
briefing is to back up the preamble as to what was 
driving the cost up and so on. And without saying a

22:03.393 --> 22:11.843
word to us, picked up this phone and said, get me 
Gene. Gene is Gene Zucker, the Secretary of the Air

22:13.392 --> 22:16.136
Force. The next thing he says, Gene, you've got a 
little fat man over here with a colonel and, hey,

22:17.738 --> 22:25.630
what did you say your name was? And pointed to 
McCone and said, Alan McCone. Alan McCone. He

22:32.420 --> 22:35.344
tells me you can't put the minute man in Missouri. I 
want you to call me back and tell me how we're going

22:36.506 --> 22:40.632
to solve this problem. It's a good day, gentlemen. 
And that was the start of how we spent some time

22:45.961 --> 23:03.165
relocating sites in Missouri to pull the costs 
down, going back for more money.

23:05.929 --> 23:08.813
Anyway, the Minuteman Wing is located in 
Missouri.

23:13.147 --> 23:15.189
Even at a higher cost to the taxpayer? Yes. And 
where did you think was the optimal site?

23:24.038 --> 23:28.283
At that time, we weren't looking at other sites. In 
other words, I wasn't in the area of trying to

23:28.303 --> 23:35.831
determine where else, because there are too many 
things involved. Targeting,

23:35.951 --> 23:40.656
support bays. support bases, maybe. We weren't 
looking at other sites. The problem right then and

23:47.088 --> 23:53.275
there was to let Sidington know that it was too 
costly. And you may even look back and say, OK, it

23:54.537 --> 24:02.085
was effective because he helped get additional 
money. Yeah. It could have been done a lot cheaper

24:04.808 --> 24:08.432
someplace else. The term lot, I don't know, but 
it's definitely cheaper as far as road

24:10.066 --> 24:16.332
improvements. And the cost of the roads was such 
that we couldn't move it alone. I mean, it took more

24:21.757 --> 24:25.000
than just our decision that it was going to be 
moved. But when the Air Force had to put it on the

24:26.021 --> 24:33.929
scale and say, gosh, it could cost that much more, 
we've got to find another place, another

24:26.021 --> 24:33.929
location. But that was a... A real interesting 
month, six week period of... Were there other

24:43.288 --> 24:44.710
problems with the project? No, not necessarily.

24:50.738 --> 25:06.600
We have...

24:50.738 --> 25:06.600
Well yes, we had one other and that was with Senator 
Fulbright in Arkansas.

25:08.605 --> 25:35.710
managed to get through an amendment to the Public 
Road Act,

25:08.605 --> 25:35.710
a provision whereby, and they didn't necessarily 
spell out airport, but when any of the Department

25:08.605 --> 25:35.710
of Defense forces or elements or some term damaged 
public roads, that the public roads would in turn

25:36.078 --> 25:45.030
be restored and paid for by funds from the 
Department of Defense. And this caused no end of

25:45.370 --> 26:01.731
concern because we felt that this was an open

25:45.370 --> 26:01.731
book to, gee, there goes an army truck. Let's stick 
them for the repair of this road. Well, hell, the

26:05.290 --> 26:08.816
road may have needed repaired for the last four or 
five years, sure.

26:12.061 --> 26:16.388
We didn't have any success of stopping the thing. 
The amendment did pass. But by the execution of it

26:18.632 --> 26:28.107
through the Bureau of Public Road, we were able to 
minimize costs that were thrown back to the

26:28.964 --> 26:42.844
different departments by close surveillance of 
the condition of all roads in which we used on a

26:28.964 --> 26:42.844
routine basis. We know whether or not, or have an 
idea as to whether, yes, we were responsible for

26:42.864 --> 26:50.295
the damage. Bridge structures are easy to 
determine because by the Bureau constantly

26:55.103 --> 26:58.386
inspecting the bridges. And then if we put heavy 
loads across for an extended period of time, well,

26:58.446 --> 27:07.374
you could pretty well determine that you're the 
guy. But the hearings with Senator Fulbright were

27:08.355 --> 27:18.644
not the most social that I've ever been through. It 
was a very difficult

27:18.664 --> 27:22.827
. In what way? uh pretty much like my father he's 
setting his ways and he's going to have his way and

27:24.517 --> 27:45.985
he's going to play the game his way or he's going to 
take his football and go home of course he was on his

27:24.517 --> 27:45.985
ground which is up on the hill and we're up there 
away from the pentagon and

27:46.319 --> 28:06.555
Senate and Congressional hearings are, if the 
public could ever see some of them, they would

27:46.319 --> 28:06.555
absolutely be disgusted with the type of people 
that they send to Washington because you can

27:46.319 --> 28:06.555
effect when the media says at the Senate hearing 
today on so-and-so that Everybody was there, and

28:07.025 --> 28:09.109
it was run right. And sure enough, there'll be one 
senator sitting across the table from maybe six or

28:09.129 --> 28:16.382
eight witnesses from the Department of the Air 
Force. And this one senator, he's conducting the

28:16.402 --> 28:19.367
hearing. And that's written as if the entire 
committee was there, and everything was going on.

28:23.795 --> 28:30.147
And

28:23.795 --> 28:30.147
it's... It's far from the democratic way of doing 
things, I think, but that's the way it is. Well, now

28:37.492 --> 28:43.158
that we're on this topic, I wanted to have your 
opinion of congressmen as a general group. I mean,

28:43.299 --> 28:56.494
when you were out in Washington dealing with 
congressmen, did your opinion of the Congress and

28:43.299 --> 28:56.494
the way our democracy works, those politicians, 
did it increase or did it decrease or change in any

28:43.299 --> 28:56.494
way? Well, no, because You realize that from what 
we've already said, I grew up in a political

29:01.025 --> 29:10.174
atmosphere. My dad worked for the city and then 
making races for the railroad commissioner. I had

29:17.781 --> 29:23.406
known congressmen and known senators and known 
people that worked for government. I wouldn't say

29:23.947 --> 29:27.130
that it had any effect on it. I will say that I'm 
trying to think of this congressman's name. He was

29:33.963 --> 29:42.672
from

29:33.963 --> 29:42.672
the Tidewater area of Virginia. When we had this 
Washington consolidation plan, we had a

29:44.594 --> 29:54.084
breakfast meeting one morning in which we briefed 
the committee he was on. And he became the culprit

29:54.104 --> 29:59.230
of the committee that was going to really really 
put us all on the spot, and right in the middle of it.

30:05.619 --> 30:09.125
And he could get away with something like this 
because we were now on neutral ground. We weren't

30:09.225 --> 30:10.127
on the hill. We weren't in the Pentagon. We were in a 
place having breakfast, and blood and breathings

30:11.669 --> 30:15.916
were going on. And right in the middle of all of his 
dogmatic questioning, he says, wouldn't you like

30:15.976 --> 30:27.715
to be on my side asking the questions instead of on 
your side having to answer?

30:31.222 --> 30:34.647
Showing that the man did have a sense of humor. He 
knew that he was a browbeatenist, but no,

30:34.667 --> 30:45.683
I can't say that it's even now.

30:48.848 --> 30:51.572
Would you say you have a high or a low opinion of the 
Congress? Neither. I don't have a high opinion of

30:54.677 --> 30:57.060
them. Maybe that's influenced a little bit by 
political feelings, and I'm sure it is, because I

30:58.306 --> 31:18.272
think that two of the congressmen that we have from 
this general location ought to be replaced, and

30:58.306 --> 31:18.272
I'm tickled to death with one of them, and that's 
the political party.

31:22.218 --> 31:24.300
Okay, so much for Congress. Tiger Teague was a 
personal friend, and I thought he was pretty good

31:24.660 --> 31:33.209
at that. So much for Congress. Were there other 
programs besides the Access Road Program that you

31:34.450 --> 31:49.685
thought was very important in the early 1960s that 
you were working on?

31:49.705 --> 31:50.065
Well,

31:53.116 --> 32:01.865
I haven't moved from the master planning branch in 
the end to the secretary's office. 1963. And then,

32:04.627 --> 32:10.733
of course, that was in the secretary's office when 
we went over to see Simon.

32:11.854 --> 32:19.782
Then following Kennedy's assassination, well, 
Allie McComb resigned or tendered his

32:11.854 --> 32:19.782
resignation. It was accepted, and he was replaced 
by a

32:20.251 --> 32:40.853
gentleman by the name of Lou Turner, who also is 
deceased at this time.

32:40.873 --> 32:47.440
Shortly after Turner came aboard, McNamara

32:48.314 --> 32:53.961
formed or started the base closure, the 
retrenchment.

32:55.903 --> 33:12.904
And two of us from Turner's staff were

32:55.903 --> 33:12.904
assigned to the committee to study out and help 
determine which air force bases were vulnerable

33:13.205 --> 33:37.305
or which should be considered for closure or for 
reduction or whatever

33:13.205 --> 33:37.305
this

33:13.205 --> 33:37.305
this proved to be very interesting and as a 
satellite i might say the second person was a

33:13.205 --> 33:37.305
individual by the name of joe meese and uh Joe Meese 
now happens to have the job that Mr. Turner had. He

33:41.580 --> 33:45.924
is the Deputy Assistant Secretary for the Air 
Force Bar Installations. He has risen on the

33:46.285 --> 33:49.848
ranks.

33:52.231 --> 34:02.601
It was interesting to go through and study and make 
the recommendations and have them reviewed by

33:52.231 --> 34:02.601
both what we call the air staff, that's the ones 
that are under the chief of staff the four-star

34:02.902 --> 34:19.729
general and then pass to the secretary for his 
review and then on to pick him up the department of

34:02.902 --> 34:19.729
defense here's the product from the air force and 
so on and then sit at department of defense and see

34:02.902 --> 34:19.729
what's coming in from the other the Army, the Navy, 
and the Marines. And what did you think were some of

34:24.450 --> 34:28.975
the bases that could have been closed? Do you 
remember some of those bases? You probably

34:31.238 --> 34:33.921
traveled around. We traveled, yeah. And did a lot 
of evaluation. Do you remember what those bases

34:36.684 --> 34:39.508
were? Oh, I can go back and look in the files that I 
have, but just to start calling them, because we

34:39.668 --> 34:47.337
closed a number of bases. The one that we kept 
trying to close but they wouldn't let us close was

34:48.160 --> 34:52.628
Ellington. Of course, the reason they wouldn't 
let us close is it was in direct support of NASA, but

34:53.469 --> 35:03.587
it was straight Air Force funding that was keeping 
Ellington open and keeping a colonel and a staff

35:03.922 --> 35:12.749
down there, and when you've got military people, 
you end up with a PX and the commissary, and sure, so

35:03.922 --> 35:12.749
you've got the base open. And so having the base, 
then you start looking for some type of troops, and

35:12.769 --> 35:26.061
we ended up putting reserve forces in there that 
flew on the weekends, things like the National

35:12.769 --> 35:26.061
Guard unit, and then you've got the base 
flourishing again. But sure, we said close it, but

35:26.081 --> 35:29.563
we could never close it. But one of the most 
interesting things that took place was in this

35:34.448 --> 35:45.543
exercise

35:34.448 --> 35:45.543
was there was a leak in one of the other services.

35:48.386 --> 35:51.150
I don't recall whether it was Army or Navy, but it 
was one of the two. And this was, of course, the last

35:51.470 --> 36:01.924
thing that McNamara wanted was that there be 
absolutely tight security until public

35:51.470 --> 36:01.924
announcement was made After that, it was a fait 
accompli. No turn back. This is what's going to

36:06.131 --> 36:07.313
happen. The decision has been made, and pop. 
Anytime there's a leak, you always throw yourself

36:10.056 --> 36:20.130
wide open to second thoughts, power groups coming 
in, do this, do that, and so on. So our boss, Mr.

36:21.352 --> 36:29.903
Turner, was a man that had spent many, many years in 
the Air Force, In fact, it had started as a GS-1 or 2

36:30.710 --> 36:51.840
and had come up through the ranks and left the Air 
Force probably as a GS-15 and went into public to

36:30.710 --> 36:51.840
private practice working for a contractor out in 
California and had spent three years out there.

36:52.141 --> 37:07.195
When McCone resigned, well, Zucker called Turner 
and back and asked him if he would like to have this

36:52.141 --> 37:07.195
particular

36:52.141 --> 37:07.195
job. He knew a lot about the Air Force. He knew a lot 
about the Department of Defense, unlike most

37:08.716 --> 37:18.125
political appointees that come in and then spend 
their first six months behind the learning curve.

37:19.526 --> 37:21.388
But we went to the boss and told him of the leak. and 
told him of the pressure that was being put on us.

37:25.761 --> 37:43.785
And he hit upon a very clever idea in which we called

37:25.761 --> 37:43.785
General Cappucci over to the office to discuss it 
with him. Now, General Cappucci was the head, at

37:43.805 --> 37:48.692
that time, was the head of The Air Force OSI, which 
is the Office of Special Investigation, they're

37:49.550 --> 37:59.402
the ones that run all of our background 
clearances. They are the secret police, whatever

37:59.562 --> 38:07.792
you want to call them, in the Air Force. I think in 
the Army it's called the

38:07.812 --> 38:18.865
Army Security Agency, ASA or something. They have 
their own codes.

38:25.063 --> 38:30.549
Their agents are the only ones that can decode a 
message. And you will find a detachment of the OSI

38:30.569 --> 38:47.367
on every Air Force base or major installation, the 
difference being base has a runway, installation

38:30.569 --> 38:47.367
does not have a runway.

38:51.110 --> 39:00.044
For instance, my son is the detachment commander 
right now of the OSI at a base in England, and there

38:51.110 --> 39:00.044
are three agents on that base. He's the top. But 
they maintain their own code. And we proposed to

39:05.012 --> 39:15.548
Cappucci that the Air Force instructions would go 
out through his channel and not through the normal

39:05.012 --> 39:15.548
communication channels. Now you can, right 
quick, anybody in mathematics can figure out how

39:16.405 --> 39:27.118
many people that's knocked out of knowledge of 
what's in that coded message. First, code in

39:27.278 --> 39:29.841
Washington. How many people would have known what 
was in the message? And then when the message got to

39:32.905 --> 39:43.678
the base, how many people would see the message, 
either before it's coded, after it was decoded,

39:32.905 --> 39:43.678
and then pass to the commander through his 
secretary or through his adjutant who would then

39:44.603 --> 39:48.569
have knowledge. Whereas the agents working in the 
OSI would receive the coded message, decode it,

39:48.589 --> 40:06.295
and he himself walked to the base commander and 
say, sir, this message has come for you through my

39:48.589 --> 40:06.295
channel.

40:06.315 --> 40:11.843
If that were broken, then we're in trouble. So we 
used that system and needless to say, there was no

40:13.122 --> 40:17.707
security. There were other security leaks later 
on in two of the services, but none in the airport.

40:24.173 --> 40:32.482
But again, this took an awful lot of close work with 
Capucci and his people.

40:34.063 --> 40:42.792
And the main thing was that the Air Force

40:34.063 --> 40:42.792
wanted to be sure that when trying to reach for a 
base, just by memory, that when McNamara

40:43.717 --> 41:01.842
announced that Air Force Base X would close and the 
media hit the commander of Base X ten minutes later

40:43.717 --> 41:01.842
and the colonel sits there and says, I don't know 
anything about it, he was knowledgeable. He knew

41:02.162 --> 41:04.746
it was going to close. we don't like to put our 
people in the spotlight right and uh so they were

41:05.452 --> 41:34.986
just as knowledgeable as it could be but under 
certain limitations so you thought that the way

41:05.452 --> 41:34.986
that this was handled by mcnamara was effectively 
very definitely uh like i said a while ago if

41:05.452 --> 41:34.986
you and i know uh this the history that you're 
reporting, is that oftentimes leaks are

41:35.320 --> 41:42.348
deliberate. Yeah. But a leak in this instance is 
the worst thing that could have happened. Because

41:49.116 --> 42:03.572
like I said, if pressure droops the chance to come 
back and appeal, take a second look, if the

41:49.116 --> 42:03.572
Secretary of Defense is knowledgeable and 
capable as McNamara would his staff, different

42:04.143 --> 42:18.881
staff or services all got together and made the 
decision within the ground rules, we've got the

42:04.143 --> 42:18.881
attitude and the climate and the money we've got 
got to cut back. These are the ones that are going

42:19.602 --> 42:32.058
outside help can only hinder to the decision 
making process.

42:32.078 --> 42:33.019
Later on the Years later, when I was in Department 
of Defense, the Army made a decision to close a

42:33.590 --> 42:45.963
certain base. It was announced, and it was put on 
what's called the reserve list. That meant that

42:51.028 --> 43:00.238
the base had to sit there and couldn't be utilized 
for anything by permanent change of the facility.

43:00.826 --> 43:05.735
Well, the people of that area came to Department of 
Defense and said, look. And it was strange,

43:05.755 --> 43:10.423
because that particular assistant secretary had 
me in the office with him. And he said, I want you to

43:10.443 --> 43:14.150
speak to this whenever you can. And on one side of 
the room, the contingent from Mineral Wells,

43:14.170 --> 43:23.627
right here in Texas, the one I mentioned the other 
day, We had it for the Aviation and Air Force. When

43:26.478 --> 43:30.002
the Army took it, they made a helicopter school out 
of it. And of course, the Army closed that school

43:30.102 --> 43:38.091
and moved everything to Alabama and put it in one 
school where they were operating two. And half of

43:38.792 --> 43:41.215
this continued for mental well. These people over 
on this side of the room said, please don't close

43:41.275 --> 43:44.538
it. We can prove that we can train helicopter 
pilots cheaper than they can train them over in

43:44.579 --> 43:50.425
Alabama. People over on this side of the room said, 
but sir, if you close it, don't put it on the reserve

43:51.687 --> 43:56.634
list. Leave it to us so that we can bring industry in 
and use the facilities to help the community. So

44:03.825 --> 44:06.830
here, this contingent for mineral wells was 
split. But don't close it. If you do close it, take

44:08.733 --> 44:11.116
it off the list. And of course, all the secretary 
can do is say, sir, it's closed. I'll try to help

44:16.164 --> 44:17.085
you. Sure.

44:22.518 --> 44:30.190
You get the feeling for these people, but you've 
got to remember first that we're still in the

44:22.518 --> 44:30.190
defense business. I was wondering about your 
thoughts about the very controversial Secretary

44:32.493 --> 44:37.481
of Defense, Matthew Brown. You had a lot of 
dealings with him. Well,

44:43.129 --> 44:51.462
I can tell you a story that Maybe we'll

44:52.319 --> 45:03.331
put in a very few words.

45:18.468 --> 45:20.250
The Assistant Secretary that

45:23.048 --> 45:26.753
that my boss worked for of the Air Force. Having a 
meeting in his office one day, I'll read you in a

45:26.773 --> 45:34.044
minute. And he was sitting at the head of the table, 
and immediately to his left was my boss, Mr.

45:34.064 --> 45:41.174
Turner. And then the table was surrounded by other 
high-ranking officers and civilians. I was

45:48.064 --> 45:52.971
sitting across the table from Mr. Turner, and 
therefore I was on On the Secretary's right hand.

45:59.540 --> 46:00.041
On McNamara's? No. This was the Assistant 
Secretary of the Air Force. And McNamara and

46:04.987 --> 46:17.562
Johnson had just pulled something that even their 
own administration and Department of Defense and
