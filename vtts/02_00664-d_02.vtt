00:01.837 --> 00:24.539
These

00:01.837 --> 00:24.539
whole discussions were very impressive that much 
more needed to be done about radioactivity in the

00:01.837 --> 00:24.539
ocean, that the waste disposal problem ended

00:01.837 --> 00:24.539
up by being swept under the rug a good deal. The 
really most apparent thing was that there was a

00:25.620 --> 00:31.405
tremendous amount of activity huge financing, 
many corporations, national policy to produce

00:32.127 --> 01:00.885
radioactivity, and there were only very slight, 
small, low priority, feeble efforts and

00:32.127 --> 01:00.885
considerations of what one should do to try and 
take

00:32.127 --> 01:00.885
care of all of it after it had been produced, in case 
the nuclear program was successful in phase one.

01:02.350 --> 01:03.351
Let's shut it off.

01:10.041 --> 01:22.378
This earlier consideration of the radioactive 
problem is one that, like many others, I copped out

01:10.041 --> 01:22.378
on and had very little to do with it for quite a long 
time.

01:25.242 --> 01:32.172
Some of the problems involved were so technically 
difficult that many oceanographers felt the

01:32.742 --> 01:42.902
Atomic Energy Commission should not undertake 
some of the more complicated ways of looking at

01:32.742 --> 01:42.902
their problems, technical ways. This, I think, 
didn't get done, and it is one of the things that I

01:52.351 --> 02:00.441
believe our oceanographic community was not fair 
to PLACES like the Atomic Energy Commission,

01:52.351 --> 02:00.441
because really they wanted to move. In some cases, 
they wanted to move ahead with, let's say, some of

02:00.501 --> 02:21.447
the optimist oceanographers, and some of the 
pessimist oceanographers sort of dampened their

02:00.501 --> 02:21.447
spirits.

02:23.755 --> 02:32.332
I think that's enough on what activity I had with 
that NASCO committee. It had a great influence on

02:32.873 --> 02:45.257
me because it did have to do with the future of the 
game and it showed that

02:32.873 --> 02:45.257
looking ahead five or ten years, if you did your 
homework, was apt to be successful. They asked for

02:52.037 --> 02:57.665
a third of a billion dollars in ten years, and they 
probably got twice that much. It wasn't all spent

02:59.108 --> 03:05.257
the way they had recommended, which was probably a 
good thing, but it did show there was great action.

03:06.960 --> 03:13.590
To my way of thinking, there has been no effort by 
oceanographers since that time that comes within

03:06.960 --> 03:13.590
a factor of three of being as aggressive, as 
forward-looking, as constructive, and so forth.

03:21.201 --> 03:25.966
I believe this is one of the reasons why we have been 
tending to do a little bit more floundering. And it

03:27.248 --> 03:34.736
is basically that the oceanographers have not 
been doing their homework as well as Washington,

03:27.248 --> 03:34.736
and we have no complaint to make. I would like to 
have one flashback here about the Ocean Resources

03:37.319 --> 03:43.847
Institute. in Woods Hole, which was largely the 
brainchild of a naval architect, ocean engineer

03:45.262 --> 03:58.756
by the name of Francis Minot and Columbus Islin.

04:02.140 --> 04:09.548
This started off as the Marine Fisheries and 
Engineering Organization, and that name was so

04:02.140 --> 04:09.548
cumbersome that we changed. I became one of the 
trustees of a fledgling organization that its

04:11.914 --> 04:23.677
office and laboratory was one small second floor 
office, seldom could afford a secretary. And it

04:23.737 --> 04:33.055
lived off a few grants from the Crane Foundation 
and from Columbus Island's uncle, and altogether

04:34.840 --> 04:41.089
too much from Columbus Island's personal 
pocketbook. But it was a very real attempt,

04:42.110 --> 04:57.793
starting about 1951, to get the oceanographic and 
engineering aspects of the oceanography

04:42.110 --> 04:57.793
proceeding. Columbus felt very strongly, and I 
certainly agreed with him, that a community such

04:59.410 --> 05:12.408
as Woods Hole should encompass more than just 
scientific oceanography.

05:16.675 --> 05:19.599
One of his criteria for having a separate... He had 
several criteria for having a separate

05:19.619 --> 05:24.185
organization, which I think were fairly sound. 
One is he felt the... If a director of an

05:27.895 --> 05:41.033
institution didn't have his hand in too many pies, 
well, then he could appear a little more realistic

05:27.895 --> 05:41.033
and have a few more hours a day to spend on the one 
that was the highest priority. He also felt, which

05:42.935 --> 05:55.152
was either right or wrong, that academic people in 
academia that were free in a research place where

05:42.935 --> 05:55.152
they're completely free to choose their subject 
should be willing to operate at lower salaries

05:55.773 --> 06:03.564
than people who were working on applied problems 
and were somewhat more under the thumb of somebody

05:55.773 --> 06:03.564
else. And he felt the salary scale in a small, he had 
tried to have a dual salary scale in one

06:04.605 --> 06:13.077
institution where you were headed for trouble. 
And if you were with separate organizations, you

06:14.620 --> 06:20.328
could have somewhat separate salary scales. And 
any worker was free to work in either place. He

06:23.212 --> 06:24.193
could get a job. This was typical of the kind of 
administrative policies that Islin used. Not

06:35.017 --> 06:43.930
everyone would agree that scientists should be 
paid less than engineers, but it may be if

06:35.017 --> 06:43.930
engineers had been paid more than scientists. In 
oceanography, we would have had ocean

06:45.212 --> 06:52.122
engineering operating long before this.

06:55.105 --> 07:15.554
Here again in the Ocean Resources Institute, 
which

06:55.105 --> 07:15.554
went under partly by bankruptcy and partly that 
the director, about 10 years later, died in an

06:55.105 --> 07:15.554
automobile accident, it never seemed to catch on. 
The people couldn't understand it was such a good

07:17.477 --> 07:24.927
idea why the Woods Hole Oceanographic 
Institution didn't do it In a way, Revelle laid

07:26.408 --> 07:38.173
here because he set up a comparable kind of 
organization in Scripps and made it part of, made

07:26.408 --> 07:38.173
it a segment of Scripps.

07:40.778 --> 07:45.328
It is now their marine resources institute.

07:46.287 --> 08:01.520
Here at Woods Hole, the institution sort of died 
out and started up again in a somewhat different

07:46.287 --> 08:01.520
vein when Woods Hole started having departments, 
and one of them was a department of ocean

07:46.287 --> 08:01.520
engineering. This, however, was significantly 
different because it was I think conceived too

08:07.313 --> 08:36.055
much on the basis of being a facility to produce 
instruments for scientists and not enough of such

08:07.313 --> 08:36.055
things of worrying about safety at sea, the 
economics and engineering of getting industry to

08:07.313 --> 08:36.055
pick up oceanographic ideas a little quicker and 
trying to put them to use.

08:39.376 --> 08:52.716
So as

08:39.376 --> 08:52.716
these things got talked about more in the 
oceanographic community, they began to get

08:39.376 --> 08:52.716
incorporated a little bit more. The Marine 
Technology Society, for example, is an

08:53.076 --> 08:56.581
illustration of this. But a good many years later, 
when Islin was very sick and in the hospital a short

09:01.837 --> 09:06.582
time before he died. He was in the Boston Hospital 
at one night when the AAAS was holding a meeting,

09:06.642 --> 09:26.301
and this meeting had been very much,

09:06.642 --> 09:26.301
or this, one or two sessions had been devoted to 
more of the industrial application of science.

09:27.842 --> 09:30.645
And I remember going over and talking to Columbus 
and saying, well, about 15 years later, where the

09:31.790 --> 09:39.421
AAAS finally got around to start talking about the 
same kinds of things he'd been talking about. And I

09:39.461 --> 09:48.393
can remember that he, although he was pretty low on 
energy, he kind of grinned and said, well, aren't

09:39.461 --> 09:48.393
we lucky it's only been 15 years?

09:53.460 --> 09:55.283
Shut it off.

10:00.528 --> 10:24.342
To come back to the question of designing ships for 
the job,

10:00.528 --> 10:24.342
we did a little bit of work

10:00.528 --> 10:24.342
back in the late 50s in getting some informal 
proposals off the National Science Foundation

10:00.528 --> 10:24.342
for something like the Atlantis II. and new ships 
for Scripps. I know there are oftentimes problems

10:30.768 --> 10:37.065
in procurement which don't show on the surface. 
One of these was exemplified by Bill Benson, who

10:41.016 --> 10:47.926
was then in geology at National Science 
Foundation. And he and I had spent a lot of time on

10:48.067 --> 11:00.606
this kind of thing, talking also with other 
oceanographers of essentially people

10:48.067 --> 11:00.606
contemporary with Bill and myself.

11:03.202 --> 11:09.352
So he took the bull by the horns and got Ravel and 
Islin and had lunch with him. I believe Art Maxwell

11:09.372 --> 11:12.257
was at that one.

11:15.483 --> 11:26.762
Benson sort of made the suggestion that if the 
National Science Foundation could get some money

11:15.483 --> 11:26.762
for some ships, what kind of ships would they like 
and this sort of thing. Here were these two

11:27.113 --> 11:33.483
directors of oceanographic institutions, and 
both of them said, we don't need any new ships.

11:34.325 --> 11:42.338
We've got all the ships we need and certainly all we 
can afford, and they're good enough for us, and

11:34.325 --> 11:42.338
that sort of that. We all had to go back to the 
drawing boards on that one for a while, but we did

11:42.976 --> 11:51.786
our homework on that one, a little bit of homework. 
After Dr. Fye took over here at Woods Hole,

11:51.866 --> 12:10.367
he organized a ship committee to look into the 
design of a new ship This took a good deal of time,

12:11.208 --> 12:19.481
and Francis Minot was the first chairman, and Dick 
Edwards the second chairman of it after Frank

12:11.208 --> 12:19.481
died. But we worked very hard on the design of 
Atlantis II. The

12:28.033 --> 12:35.785
Bethlehem Steel Corporation got the design 
contract. And one little instance here, which I

12:35.805 --> 12:38.970
think is important, After about the fourth round 
of design, when it already looked like we'd been

12:39.980 --> 12:57.280
spending too much time on design, there was much 
talk about finishing that design and saying put it

12:39.980 --> 12:57.280
in production.

12:58.897 --> 13:13.459
I had people go around the table and make their 
comments, and I felt a little embarrassed doing

12:58.897 --> 13:13.459
this, but I brought up the point that it took six 
weeks to do, a month to six weeks to do a redesign,

12:58.897 --> 13:13.459
and it cost about $25,000. We'd already done this 
three times, and each time there was a vast

13:13.780 --> 13:20.730
improvement. I thought if we went around, if we 
could face it one more time, we'd have a lot better

13:21.792 --> 13:26.659
ship. And I was simply delighted that people went 
along with this.

13:36.208 --> 13:50.409
The ship got to be big enough and solid enough to 
where it became really a kind of a true competitor,

13:36.208 --> 13:50.409
much more a true competitor with the chain. And 
this ship probably had one of the best layouts of

13:56.542 --> 13:57.603
any ship. It's a very pleasant ship to work on from 
the standpoint of the way it is laid out.

14:05.674 --> 14:16.407
This was an improvement on the designs of the Agors 
in which a large number of working oceanographers

14:17.230 --> 14:37.018
decided that if they made off-center deckhouses 
and lopsided afterdecks, that then they could

14:17.230 --> 14:37.018
handle their equipment much better and have a much 
better physical layout.

14:37.038 --> 14:44.368
Perhaps the biggest experiment in Atlantis II was 
to have a library in it. The

14:46.829 --> 15:06.340
decision was to have a space which was at least as 
large as the captain's cabin and fixed up at least

14:46.829 --> 15:06.340
as well as the captain's cabin and establish a good 
library and a pleasant place to be with a library

14:46.829 --> 15:06.340
that was divided between general fiction and 
travel and technology. This has turned out to be a

15:12.042 --> 15:16.211
very successful thing. We've incorporated it in 
our other ships. It gives many more references

15:19.118 --> 15:25.172
available on the spot provides much more 
education. The level of reading material in the

15:28.217 --> 15:35.487
ship has improved many fold over what it had been in 
the past. And one of the nicest things about it that

15:36.809 --> 15:46.401
has pleased me is when you're on an expedition in 
which there are people from other countries

15:36.809 --> 15:46.401
there, It turns out that many of these people come 
from countries where the library isn't as good as

15:46.381 --> 15:51.346
we have on the Atlantis. And it's indeed a pleasure 
to see people be able to tour over things, look up

15:52.507 --> 15:59.354
things on time. It

16:00.075 --> 16:15.730
has greatly improved almost the semi-formal 
teaching of classes and courses, or at least of

16:00.075 --> 16:15.730
issues aboard the ship. That may not seem like a 
very large step in seagoing, because some of the

16:18.005 --> 16:28.776
larger European ships have had this kind of thing 
for a long time. American ships had not.

16:36.324 --> 16:44.653
To continue a bit on ship building, ship 
designing, I continued to work with some of the

16:36.324 --> 16:44.653
other laboratories that were involved with ship 
design where they were interested in having

16:45.224 --> 16:48.329
cooperation.

16:51.534 --> 17:06.777
Still later when Woods Hole decided they needed a 
Crawford replacement, Dr.

16:51.534 --> 17:06.777
Fye asked me if I would be chairman of that ship 
committee and I was. The other principal worker

17:06.897 --> 17:12.666
was John Leiby who was largely responsible for so 
many fine things about the ship. But I think on that

17:18.536 --> 17:27.195
ship committee, what we did is we had many very 
realistic discussions as to what did people want

17:30.027 --> 17:56.068
what did the scientists want, and we tried to 
parcel out the kinds of things that different

17:30.027 --> 17:56.068
ships were best for, and this ship ended up to be 
primarily a ship for the physical oceanographic

17:30.027 --> 17:56.068
department, or I should say rather it was a ship 
that was specifically designed to do the kind of

17:30.027 --> 17:56.068
work they wanted to do as well as possible and work 
for Some of the other departments took more of a

17:56.825 --> 18:00.770
back seat. As a result, even though the ship was 
only 170 feet long, it was the fastest ship we have,

18:01.531 --> 18:15.969
and it's turned out to be a very good ship and a very 
happy ship. People like to work on it. One

18:17.791 --> 18:25.701
of the reasons, an example of one of the reasons why 
people should do their homework And it pays to be

18:26.086 --> 18:29.592
positive about it. Although

18:29.712 --> 18:40.611
Dr. Fye worked very hard, he was unable to get 
private funds for the ship, but we did get NSF to

18:29.712 --> 18:40.611
build it. They made us come down on the specs some, 
and we had to take it as a bare boat, hardly with

18:41.552 --> 18:51.790
enough equipment to come away from the 
manufacturer. But sort of just as we were going to

18:53.069 --> 19:01.120
order it, they said, incidentally, would you like 
to order two more? So as a result, there are now

19:02.242 --> 19:07.669
three of those ships or slight variations of them 
in the game. And I think the lesson here is to

19:08.711 --> 19:21.068
assume, if you're working in the right direction, 
to assume that there's a high probability you may

19:08.711 --> 19:21.068
have have or find friends that will carry the game 
along even though it looks hopeless to you at the

19:22.060 --> 19:28.630
time.

19:37.985 --> 19:40.609
In the last few years I've been interested in, 
gotten interested in, was always in quite a

19:41.568 --> 19:58.229
variety of things, but I've gotten somewhat more 
extracurricular and somewhat longer range in the

19:41.568 --> 19:58.229
timescales of what I have been working on. This may 
be an indication of old age. I understand it's a

20:02.534 --> 20:05.217
general trend. But also, our institution

20:11.622 --> 20:30.289
started getting a lot of titles and the one of 
senior scientists they indicate it's a title in

20:11.622 --> 20:30.289
which people should be free to worry about longer 
term things and it's becoming very clear in our

20:11.622 --> 20:30.289
highly organized society And the fact that young 
people have to publish or perish, and if they don't

20:31.501 --> 20:42.807
publish, they get booted out almost before you can 
find who they're capable of really good work or

20:31.501 --> 20:42.807
not. But there are certain kinds of problems 
that... are going to require more time. And it

20:49.309 --> 21:04.185
seemed to me that if the institution set up the 
category of senior scientists, so this was one of

20:49.309 --> 21:04.185
the options open for them, that I would push that 
option a little harder than perhaps I might.

21:07.929 --> 21:16.999
Recently, I've gotten very much interested in the 
particular aspect of how one does better

21:07.929 --> 21:16.999
sub-bottom profiling. Now,

21:18.565 --> 21:31.478
what I have to say next may indicate that it may turn 
out to be wrong and a poor step. But it is a general

21:31.498 --> 21:37.103
direction that we need higher resolution. I think 
higher resolution is the name of the game in a great

21:37.123 --> 21:40.627
many things. It's true of the BT. It's true of the 
slowly corrected instruments. It's true of the

21:45.452 --> 21:47.914
history of our science. I think it is also true that 
astronomers as a whole use their physics more to

21:48.974 --> 22:01.331
help them understand the limits of measurement 
and then they try and achieve those. In

22:02.292 --> 22:12.366
oceanography we tend to get somewhat more sloppy 
and concern ourselves with how poor measurements

22:02.292 --> 22:12.366
can we get by with.

22:13.426 --> 22:36.328
High resolution sonar at high frequencies, 
whether used to locate mines or fish or what the

22:13.426 --> 22:36.328
doctor uses to determine what the sex of an unborn 
child is, has progressed much further than high

22:13.426 --> 22:36.328
resolution equipment in low frequency games that 
we use on ships.

22:37.135 --> 22:43.505
One example of this was a very high precision piece 
of echo sounding gear the Navy made. I had hoped to

22:43.585 --> 22:55.363
get some of this into oceanography, but one didn't 
seem to be able to get very much enthusiasm really

22:43.585 --> 22:55.363
for specialized ships. very specialized 
apparatus. And this indicates again why

22:58.506 --> 23:16.705
frequently I've liked to work with the Navy, 
because the Navy would be interested in the

22:58.506 --> 23:16.705
equipment that was, in oceanographic equipment, 
that was better than what oceanographers seemed

22:58.506 --> 23:16.705
to be interested in. Part of it is a defeatist 
attitude. They figured if there wasn't enough

23:18.327 --> 23:21.590
money for it, why dream about it? But on the other 
hand, if you don't dream about it, you never get it.

23:26.140 --> 23:39.139
Radio

23:26.140 --> 23:39.139
astronomers and

23:26.140 --> 23:39.139
geophysicists tend to use about the same 
wavelengths. And radio astronomers and people

23:41.282 --> 23:51.237
who deal in commercial people, radar people, they 
have some very big dishes which are equivalent to

23:52.415 --> 23:55.518
the optical analogs of lenses or reflectors. And 
they make their money by having extremely high

23:56.499 --> 24:04.829
directionality, of having extremely high energy 
gathering power. And this is a game we have not

24:05.369 --> 24:10.435
played at any very low frequency in oceanography.

24:14.800 --> 24:22.388
The general concept of having a ship at least as big 
as an ordinary research ship, which is nearly

24:23.600 --> 24:28.767
nearly all acoustic lens or acoustic reflector I 
think has a very real place. And I've been spending

24:29.848 --> 24:42.925
a modest amount of my time in the last two or three 
years in trying to see if this makes sense and the

24:46.567 --> 24:55.919
And while I haven't been able to get very much 
financing for it, I feel this is a direction which

24:46.567 --> 24:55.919
is probably inevitable.

25:01.206 --> 25:10.819
If one reads Galileo, he was very excited indeed 
when he got a lens and could look in the sky with an

25:01.206 --> 25:10.819
added resolution that it gave.

25:13.027 --> 25:29.095
I've been sort of concerning myself with whether 
if one had a reflector as big as 100 meters in

25:13.027 --> 25:29.095
diameter, which is small compared to the big 
tanker, what its implications to geophysics and

25:13.027 --> 25:29.095
echo sounding might be.

25:32.720 --> 25:54.390
The military with either sonar or radar would find 
it very difficult indeed to isolate and

25:32.720 --> 25:54.390
understand a particular and classify a 
particular target if they proceeded with only

25:32.720 --> 25:54.390
gear which is obviously incapable of high 
resolution as what we routinely use in

25:32.720 --> 25:54.390
oceanography.

25:57.374 --> 26:03.722
Another kind of thing I've gotten interested in 
recently is acoustics in the blind.

26:08.128 --> 26:24.208
The very early days of acoustics in submarining 
and listening, you just couldn't help but have the

26:08.128 --> 26:24.208
feeling that as a professional listener, I must be 
a rank amateur compared to the blind person. And in

26:25.707 --> 26:47.344
the field of oceanography, where nearly 
everything we learn is by remote

26:25.707 --> 26:47.344
instrumentation, the field of geophysics, where 
it's remote instrumentation, and measurements

26:25.707 --> 26:47.344
are either made in the acoustic field or in 
frequencies that can easily be translated to it,

26:25.707 --> 26:47.344
or they're made with sensors that can be converted 
to that. Not that for a moment that I think that

26:49.788 --> 27:00.441
blind people can hear significantly better than

26:49.788 --> 27:00.441
sighted people. And I've been warned to emphasize 
this. But I have a very high respect for the true

27:05.807 --> 27:12.615
professional in almost any game. And in 
acoustics, it must be the blind person that is the

27:13.957 --> 27:18.462
real professional. I don't know the blind very 
well, but I understand instrumentation pretty

27:19.370 --> 27:28.861
well, and I understand the terrible, terrible 
limitations of instrumentation.

27:33.406 --> 27:48.263
Even the most optimistic of the realistic 
computer people think it would be folly to think

27:33.406 --> 27:48.263
that in this century we could even come close to a 
typewriter that could could type messages and

27:50.605 --> 28:06.876
multilingual and begin to catch the nuances and 
things like this, let alone hearing, typing what

27:50.605 --> 28:06.876
one person at a cocktail party says.

28:07.430 --> 28:32.678
In the general ability to understand what they 
hear, to put things in a perceptual and geometric

28:07.430 --> 28:32.678
location, it may well be that the human mind, and I 
stress the human mind rather than the human ear,

28:07.430 --> 28:32.678
may have some advantages which we have not 
capitalized on today, whether this is in

28:33.890 --> 28:43.420
understanding seismology, perhaps 
understanding earthquakes or so forth from the

28:33.890 --> 28:43.420
standpoint of science, getting better 
acquainted with the acoustics of fish. These are

28:44.001 --> 28:46.483
fields which I think might be right.

28:49.947 --> 29:03.762
Probably far more important from the standpoint 
of general society is that if you read the

28:49.947 --> 29:03.762
rehabilitation literature for the blind, it is 
nearly all on how does one find a job simple enough

28:49.947 --> 29:03.762
for a subhuman where there may be classes of jobs in 
which their acoustical ability, of their

29:04.940 --> 29:29.496
resolution ability, or their ability of the 
portion of their mind which analyzes acoustic

29:04.940 --> 29:29.496
signals, may open up for them jobs in which they 
will be the professionals, quality control and

29:04.940 --> 29:29.496
production lines. working with police 
departments to identify voices, and

29:30.725 --> 29:42.372
in structural mechanics.
