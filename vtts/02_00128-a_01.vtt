00:02.242 --> 00:16.481
I have the pleasure of talking to Bob Lacey, an old 
colleague, and want to chat with him about his

00:02.242 --> 00:16.481
experiences as one of the key people at A&M for a 
number of years. First, Bob, give us a brief

00:17.902 --> 00:26.433
summary of your biography up until you go to work at 
A&M. Where did you grow up? When did you get to A&M?

00:28.797 --> 00:29.678
What did you major in? And so forth. Okay. Well, I 
grew up in Centerville, Texas. Born October 6,

00:34.196 --> 00:36.380
1937. Went to public school in Centerville. 
Centerville is a small community of about 800

00:39.805 --> 00:43.790
people in Leon County. How many in the senior 
class? 28 in the senior class. I remarked there,

00:47.836 --> 00:50.841
we've never been anywhere. Chartered a bus to New 
Orleans and had our senior trip down there and was

00:51.722 --> 00:57.190
evicted out of two hotels in three days.

01:03.054 --> 01:17.589
But I graduated from high school in 1956 and came to 
Texas A&M in the fall of 1956 and majored in

01:03.054 --> 01:17.589
mathematics, which I got my degree in. Graduated 
in three and a half years, finished in January of

01:18.730 --> 01:24.696
1960. I really didn't know what I wanted to do, and 
my father, having been in the school business when

01:25.030 --> 01:40.447
he was a young man, he said, look, I always feel that 
a teaching certificate's a good thing for a person

01:25.030 --> 01:40.447
to have that particularly doesn't know what they 
want to do. So I stayed an extra semester and picked

01:40.467 --> 01:48.456
up the education courses that qualified me for a 
teaching certificate. I left A&M in the fall of 60

01:49.246 --> 01:56.435
and went down to Cypress Fairbanks High School. I 
taught math there for two years and decided that I

01:56.455 --> 02:10.712
wanted to get a graduate degree, primarily in the 
field of educational administration because I

01:56.455 --> 02:10.712
thought that I might make public school a career. 
And I received a leave of absence. from Tractor's

02:14.373 --> 02:16.516
Firebank, which I'm still on. And I came to A&M and 
needed some help in getting the finances for the

02:18.018 --> 02:26.870
master's degree. So I went over and knocked on Dr. 
Klippel's door. Dr. Klippel was head of the math

02:30.936 --> 02:33.480
department at that time. This would have been in 
the fall or the summer, rather, of 1961. And he

02:40.445 --> 02:44.231
said, yeah, we can use you as a teaching assistant. 
So they gave me a teaching assistant job, and I

02:44.251 --> 02:54.205
enrolled in the Master of Education 
Administration program. And I was a teaching

02:54.225 --> 03:03.799
assistant for two years, I believe, and graduated 
with my degree in 1963. And I still didn't know what

03:03.960 --> 03:09.608
I wanted to do, so Dr. Clipple indicated that I'd 
done a good job for him. He said, look, would you

03:12.930 --> 03:16.936
like to be put on as an instructor? I said, well, 
sure. So he gave me an instructor job. And I was one

03:21.523 --> 03:29.495
of the few that had the good fortune of being housed 
in Bagley Hall in my office. Bagley, you remember

03:29.515 --> 03:32.799
where Bagley was? But describe it for those who... 
Well, Bagley Hall was located over about where

03:32.820 --> 03:38.548
the... in the area where the Harrington Building 
is, or a little bit north of there, actually. And

03:47.684 --> 03:49.806
that's where the water tower was located on 
campus. And it was an old brick building, two

03:49.826 --> 03:56.553
stories, that had been there

03:49.826 --> 03:56.553
forever. Just like that building in the scene. And 
in the fall, excuse me, in the fall of 1964, After I

04:07.081 --> 04:18.173
finished my degree, I got a telephone call one day 
from Mr. Heaton, who was in the registrar.

04:20.196 --> 04:22.158
No, no, no. You were getting a call from Mr. Heaton? 
Oh, yeah. In December of 64, I got a telephone call

04:27.844 --> 04:32.329
from Mr. Heaton. and said that my name had been 
recommended to him as a possible replacement for

04:33.035 --> 04:46.496
an assistant registrar in the records section, 
and he'd like to talk to me. So I go over before the

04:46.516 --> 05:00.679
Christmas holidays and sit down and visit with 
him, and they had this opening, and he said, you

04:46.516 --> 05:00.679
have been recommended to me by the chairman of your 
master's committee and a couple of the committee

04:46.516 --> 05:00.679
members, which might be a possibility. And I'd 
like to talk to you about the job. Well, what the job

05:05.067 --> 05:14.224
entailed was maintaining the records of all of the 
students and the former students, the academic

05:05.067 --> 05:14.224
members, the former students, me and him. And it 
came quite a shock to me because I'd never done

05:14.244 --> 05:17.610
anything like this. I was really looking kind of 
forward to maybe getting back to the Cypress

05:17.730 --> 05:23.140
Firebank area in the second year or so. Anyway, I 
told him, I said, look, I need to think about this. I

05:27.478 --> 05:28.399
really don't know. I'm going off on a deer hunt down 
in South Texas, and while I'm out there in the

05:28.419 --> 05:33.724
woods, well, I'll be thinking. So I did, and what 
really had me puzzled was I knew nothing about any

05:33.744 --> 05:41.833
kind of administration. I worked in basically 
agriculture and teaching school. That's about

05:46.498 --> 05:48.300
all I've done. But anyway, I thought about it for a 
long time, and I came back and I talked to two or

05:49.293 --> 06:01.328
three of my old professors around here, and they 
said, look, it's an opportunity to take it. It

06:01.348 --> 06:01.748
doesn't work out. So I accepted the job and went to 
work in the registrar's office at the Central

06:01.769 --> 06:08.697
Registrar February 1, 1965. How much was that 
beginning salary? The beginning salary was,

06:11.701 --> 06:16.667
well, I was making $600 a month in the math 
department, And I was promised my same amount of

06:17.153 --> 06:23.422
money when I got over to the administration. But my 
first check, my salary was cut from $600 to $550 a

06:23.522 --> 06:28.909
month. And I never did really know the reason for 
that. But anyway, that was the wishes of the

06:32.234 --> 06:38.623
administrator in charge. And so I was happy with 
that. Describe the admissions and records staff

06:46.634 --> 06:50.460
and function when you joined? Okay, the entire 
operation was housed in the Richard Koch building

06:51.261 --> 07:09.250
on the first floor north side across the hall from 
the fiscal office and we occupied the basement,

06:51.261 --> 07:09.250
commonly referred to as the catacombs. We 
occupied half of the basement, actually. So we had

07:12.847 --> 07:17.891
half of the basement and half of the first floor. At 
that time, we had a registrar and director of

07:19.133 --> 07:23.416
admissions. Mr. Eaton carried both times. And we 
had an associate registrar, Ray Perriman, and an

07:26.139 --> 07:35.087
assistant registrar, Bob Lacey. And we had one 
excuse me, at that time we did not. Mr. Eaton was

07:40.994 --> 07:45.620
handling all of the admissions with the exception 
of Caroline Mitchell. Caroline Mitchell was an

07:45.640 --> 07:55.172
assistant director of admissions and she was in 
charge among many other duties she had. She was in

07:55.833 --> 07:59.778
charge of all the transfer, the undergraduate 
transfer. Reckon how many years of experience of

07:59.798 --> 08:05.124
A&M those people represented? At that time I'd say 
close to a hundred. Because they'd all been here.

08:12.834 --> 08:16.058
Because they'd all been there for a long, long, 
long time. Describe their personality and their

08:17.360 --> 08:23.027
each of them and their style of doing the job. Mr. 
Heaton was a very, very kind and considerate

08:25.210 --> 08:32.278
gentleman to work for. I found him as far as 
supervision with me, which I like very much. He

08:39.997 --> 08:48.606
expected us to get our job done, yet he didn't 
constantly

08:39.997 --> 08:48.606
stay close to us. He gave me a job and we were to do it, 
and we did it. He always gave us the strong support

08:54.953 --> 09:03.402
and the backup that we needed. Caroline Mitchell 
was a very strong-willed personality lady.

09:16.486 --> 09:30.549
Caroline had a number of functions, and this will 
probably shock you when you think about what we

09:16.486 --> 09:30.549
have today, but not only was she in charge of the 
transfer students, she was in charge of building

09:16.486 --> 09:30.549
the master schedule of classes. She was the editor 
of the catalog. She assigned all of the classroom

09:33.916 --> 09:38.100
teaching space on the campus. And she ran the 
summer orientation, the freshman orientation

09:38.981 --> 09:46.067
conferences. She had two clerical type . Mr. 
Perriman was the associate registrar, and of

09:49.911 --> 09:58.839
course I reported to him for a while. And his basic 
responsibilities had to do with the overall

10:02.840 --> 10:10.515
operation of the registrar's office related to 
the record section. And I guess his main

10:10.955 --> 10:20.173
responsibility, which was quite heavy in those 
days, was the residency factor. hadn't

10:20.677 --> 10:34.230
determined whether or not a student was to have 
residence, had state residency, or whether to be

10:20.677 --> 10:34.230
classified as a resident. And then he was also, 
over

10:34.250 --> 10:39.715
all the clerical functions that aided him, 
residency as well. And also he was in charge of

10:39.735 --> 10:41.877
graduation, too. I forgot about that, which at 
that time was quite a chore because of the way in

10:41.897 --> 10:49.705
which he was. The enrollment at Texas A&M in 1965, 
if my memory serves me correctly, was somewhere, I

10:50.782 --> 11:09.566
think, around 8,000

10:50.782 --> 11:09.566
to 10,000, maybe 12,000. I'm not too certain about 
that. We hadn't grown a whole lot. We were coming

11:14.472 --> 11:20.620
out of the era of all-male, all-military change in 
1963, so a few years after that. Who did the

11:21.325 --> 11:24.453
admissions? Mr. Heaton did most of the 
admissions. Shortly after I came, they did hire

11:29.467 --> 11:34.320
another admissions assistant. It was a fellow by 
the name of Bob Gleason. Bob handled the freshman

11:37.998 --> 11:45.310
undergraduates, and Caroline handled the 
transfer students. Of course, as you well know,

11:45.330 --> 11:58.371
graduate admissions, although our office was 
responsible for the record keeping of the

11:45.330 --> 11:58.371
applications of Bob and Lewis and all that sort of 
stuff, that determination was made in the

11:45.330 --> 11:58.371
graduate college. Now, all of the technological

12:05.842 --> 12:08.987
work was done on typewriters then? All of it. All of 
it. Was some of it done by hand still? No. Well, when

12:16.037 --> 12:24.710
I came there, the posting of the academic record, I 
assume that's basically one of the main things.

12:25.652 --> 12:31.140
The posting of the academic record was done by 
punch cards down at the computer center, being

12:31.694 --> 12:38.102
generated on each student after the professor 
turned in their grades. The grades at that time

12:38.122 --> 12:44.089
were turned in on IBM cards, but they were written 
in. In other words, Joe Doe in Math 102, Section

12:44.109 --> 12:51.798
500, the professor would put his grade on there and 
sign his name. And also at that time, we kept

12:51.818 --> 12:56.885
absentees on all of our students. Those IBM cards 
were then key punched. at the computer center. The

13:02.490 --> 13:11.903
data punched in, geared to the student 
identification number, and then were sorted in

13:02.490 --> 13:11.903
order of the student's name. And all of these were 
taking six courses and they all came together

13:12.143 --> 13:17.190
under his name. And at that time, all of the 
permanent academic records were transported to

13:17.210 --> 13:27.604
the computer center by means of the assistant 
registrar And at night, these were run, and you'd

13:28.225 --> 13:32.890
have to stay there for security reasons. And each 
one of these things were then printed on the

13:32.910 --> 13:36.995
student's academic record. Quite a horrendous 
task. And one of the first things that I got

13:40.239 --> 13:46.526
interested in was a faster and better way to do 
that. So I was able to do a lot of visitations and

13:46.546 --> 13:53.895
whatnot, find what they call a heat transfer 
posting method. And that permitted us then to have

13:54.449 --> 14:00.416
a carbon tape run at the computer center after 
these shorts were made. And then we could post the

14:00.436 --> 14:07.885
records in our office, and that stopped us from 
having to take them out. And it was done in one

14:07.905 --> 14:12.651
swoop, one stamp, and the entire semester was on 
the students' records. How long did that run take?

14:15.254 --> 14:22.903
To do it by heat transfer, we could do it in about 
three or four days, as opposed to about two weeks of

14:15.254 --> 14:22.903
what they were doing earlier. And obviously that 
speeded up the delivery of transcripts that

14:23.457 --> 14:32.609
students were in great need for at the end of the 
semester. We started to give much faster

14:32.629 --> 14:37.935
turnaround on our transcripts. One thing that I 
think might be interesting in this that I forgot to

14:38.035 --> 14:52.654
tell you when I was hired, the reason that I was 
hired was that the assistant registrar that was in

14:38.035 --> 14:52.654
charge, or that had the position that Mr. Heaton 
talked to me about, had taken a bribe from some of

14:53.377 --> 15:04.750
our foreign students at that time to change 
grades.

15:04.770 --> 15:20.127
And in time this surfaced and charges were brought 
against the Assistant Registrar and there was a

15:04.770 --> 15:20.127
trial and he was given a suspended sentence I think 
for five to six years. Mr. Rutter, of course, was

15:20.815 --> 15:24.140
the president of the university at that time. And 
when Mr. Heaton made the offer to me, he told me that

15:24.961 --> 15:38.261
there would be a complete investigation of my 
background from day one until now, now being in 65.

15:39.923 --> 15:41.866
And I said fine. I thought I could withstand that. 
Several years after that, after I got to know a lot

15:45.335 --> 16:03.234
of people around there, particularly the folks 
over at security, Chief Ed Powell, who was chief of

15:45.335 --> 16:03.234
security at that time, and I were having coffee one 
day, and he said, Bob, he said, I know you real well

15:45.335 --> 16:03.234
now, and he said, I'm going to tell you something. 
He said, what's that? He said, Mr. Rutter ordered

16:05.396 --> 16:14.346
an investigation of you by the FBI, the Texas 
Department of Public Safety, the Brazos County

16:14.714 --> 16:32.174
Sheriff's Department and our security here, and 
said in all those years from date of birth until

16:14.714 --> 16:32.174
1965, we found that you had a speeding ticket 
issued to you between Austin and San Antonio in

16:14.714 --> 16:32.174
1957. I said, that is correct. And so it was quite a, 
obviously, Mr. Rutter, this caused the

16:35.738 --> 16:43.928
university a lot of embarrassment, as you can well 
imagine. So he wanted to be sure and having, as you

16:44.228 --> 16:55.966
well know, the military background he had, I think 
that made it even more important to him that this

16:44.228 --> 16:55.966
check be done. All of us that knew Mr. Heaton knew 
him as a very special person. When did he begin his

17:03.278 --> 17:06.002
work with the university? Do you know? I think it 
was in the very late 30s or early 40s. Mr. Heaton got

17:13.351 --> 17:24.744
his undergraduate degree, I believe, at Stephen 
F. Austin State University in Nacogdoches, and he

17:13.351 --> 17:24.744
came here to get a master's degree. He was enrolled 
in a master's program here, and I believe began

17:24.764 --> 17:35.616
work in the registrar's office at that time, and 
was hired I am not I'm not certain that he came as an

17:36.153 --> 18:03.696
assistant or if he just had part-time work but I 
believe he followed a man named Charlie Friday as a

17:36.153 --> 18:03.696
regular guard so late 30s or early 40s for me as a 
junior faculty member in the 60s I thought

17:36.153 --> 18:03.696
apparently he had come at the beginning of time 
well it seemed like he's been here forever right I

18:03.980 --> 18:07.624
never saw him without a tie on, his shirt and tie. I 
never thought of him as engaging in much small

18:09.926 --> 18:19.876
talk, but I never was around him when he wasn't 
pleasant. Always pleasant. You're absolutely

18:21.378 --> 18:22.739
correct. As a matter of fact, the few times that I 
saw Mr. Heaton without a coat and tie on, I felt like

18:22.879 --> 18:30.527
he was somewhat undressed. uh he just he didn't 
look right he looked like a person that wore

18:30.980 --> 18:55.317
glasses all the time and didn't have them on 
sometimes

18:30.980 --> 18:55.317
deeply religious man very very religious very 
heavily involved in the first magic church and

18:30.980 --> 18:55.317
pride and likewise his wife also uh very kind i 
suppose if i had a Mr. Heaton had many, many

18:56.225 --> 18:59.168
qualities, good qualities. I suppose if I had to 
fault him, and he and I talked about this from time

18:59.188 --> 19:25.590
to time, and I think it's one of the things that he 
admired about me, and you know how direct I am, and

18:59.188 --> 19:25.590
sometimes that's gotten me into trouble, but Mr. 
Heaton would avoid, he did not like controversy,

18:59.188 --> 19:25.590
and he would do everything he could to avoid it, in 
my opinion, to a fault, because I felt at times that

19:25.958 --> 19:32.387
He should have said, look, I've got to draw the 
line, and this is the way it's got to be, and that

19:25.958 --> 19:32.387
sort of thing. And maybe that was from his 
upbringing, his religious background, or

19:32.508 --> 19:39.338
whatever. He did, in my opinion, I felt like he did. 
Maybe, for a better word, he got Steve Rosen. Now,

19:47.890 --> 19:54.480
as you started out, did you get any 
indoctrination, any training? As a new

19:55.540 --> 19:58.325
professional member of the staff? Haskell, when I 
walked in that office, which was located in the

19:59.146 --> 20:18.882
basement, that's where the record section was at 
that time, and looked at that desk, I felt like I

19:59.146 --> 20:18.882
should go upstairs and resign immediately 
because when this man was terminated for his acts,

20:19.570 --> 20:40.077
everything was left and then you see it had been 
like three months and they didn't have anybody

20:19.570 --> 20:40.077
that was there as a supervisor mr perriman was 
doing the best he could but he was spread real thin

20:19.570 --> 20:40.077
with his other job and uh it was more or less you know 
here it is you've got to straighten it up and we can

20:19.570 --> 20:40.077
help we'll help you if you can so Not to be critical, 
but it would just get in there and roll your sleeves

20:40.597 --> 20:47.424
up and try to figure out what needs to be done. It was 
in a mess, and it took quite a bit of time to get it

20:47.444 --> 20:52.650
organized. I've always been fortunate in my 
entire work at A&M. Fortunate in the sense that if I

20:56.354 --> 21:04.343
looked good, it was because I had good people that I 
was surrounded by. And I had wonderful clerical

21:04.403 --> 21:07.566
ladies there that They were looking for someone to 
give them some direction and they were ready to

21:08.238 --> 21:12.885
work. Now, a typical Heaton work week, what was, 
how long did he, what time, what time did he get

21:14.887 --> 21:23.840
there and leave? Mr. Heaton would be there 
sometimes, most mornings between 7 and 7.30 and he

21:23.880 --> 21:32.372
would leave between 6 and 6.30. uh always if he took 
a lunch hour unless he had some kind of a lunching

21:32.926 --> 21:53.432
engagement and he went home every day for lunch if 
he could of course he had his wife her health was not

21:32.926 --> 21:53.432
good and he would go home to look in on her but he used 
to always tell me that what made his day was that he

21:32.926 --> 21:53.432
could go home have a great bite to eat. He could 
stretch out in his Strider lounger and get 15

21:55.771 --> 22:00.497
minutes of a nap. But he was back at 1 o'clock every 
single day. Now, he reported directly then to...

22:05.543 --> 22:12.111
At that time, he reported to Wayne Heidel. No, he 
reported to Bill Graff. Bill Graff. Bill had a

22:16.316 --> 22:21.222
title at that time of Dean of Instruction. I assume 
if you had to... acquainted with today, it would be

22:23.821 --> 22:34.271
somewhat near a provost position, although the 
provost today has much wider responsibilities.

22:34.291 --> 22:37.774
But he was the number two man at the university at 
that time. Dr. Graff was fully directed to the

22:37.794 --> 22:43.840
president. Alright, now does Wayne Hall follow 
him? Wayne Hall, let's see, Dr. Hall was not Dean of

22:52.542 --> 22:55.545
the Graduate College at that time. I believe Paul 
Trotter. All right, Hall would be later Vice

22:59.048 --> 23:06.395
President of Academic Affairs and Dean of the 
Graduate College. And Bill Barzak was his number

23:06.415 --> 23:10.199
two, and I worked halftime up there. That's 
correct. That came after. Okay, after. That came

23:12.261 --> 23:13.743
after, yeah. So Mr. Heaton and the staff reported 
to Graff, Graff to Rutter. That's correct. And all

23:20.588 --> 23:27.254
of those people, the offices were all there in the 
Koch building. That's a good point. I didn't

23:28.456 --> 23:30.137
finish while ago. The other part of the Koch 
building was occupied upon the, starting with the

23:30.157 --> 23:35.102
second floor. Mr. Rutter was in the president's 
office. Southeast corner. Exactly. And then on

23:41.388 --> 23:47.454
the southwest corner of that building was where 
Dean Graff was, or Bill Graff was. Across the

23:47.474 --> 23:48.655
hall... Directly across the hall from the 
entrance into Dr. Grant's office was the faculty

23:49.141 --> 23:55.954
room. And the faculty room was where large 
meetings were held, but it was primarily for the

23:57.237 --> 24:04.151
academic council. The academic council at that 
time was made up of all the presidents, the deans,

24:04.171 --> 24:10.423
and the department heads. And I guess it would be 
somewhat of a forerunner to the faculty senate.

24:17.063 --> 24:19.367
Now, who else was down on the first floor? And on 
the, let's see, who was in the office?

24:28.721 --> 24:31.405
You know, there's another office up there where 
Howard Wester was. Remember where Howard was? Who

24:32.747 --> 24:33.408
was in that office? Was that the graduate dean? The 
graduate dean, that's correct, the graduate

24:35.531 --> 24:37.474
dean. Then down on your floor? Down on my floor on 
the south half of the first floor was the fiscal

24:39.363 --> 24:45.489
office. And that's where Clark Diebel and his 
staff, plus they occupied the basement directly

24:45.509 --> 24:56.138
under that on the south side of the building. All 
right. Share with me from the 60s, if you can, had

24:58.600 --> 25:07.528
the first black students gotten here Of course, 
when I was in school here, there were no blacks at

25:08.200 --> 25:15.050
all. The first time that I can recall of blacks was 
about 1964-65.

25:31.773 --> 25:36.520
There was no discussion whatsoever that I was 
aware of about their admission. As I understand,

25:37.175 --> 25:58.396
Mr. Rutter called the Pentagon, and the Pentagon, 
at his request, when they sent that year's group of

25:37.175 --> 25:58.396
enlisted Army to work on their degree at Pentagon 
expense, some of them were black, and they began in

25:37.175 --> 25:58.396
summer school. I believe that is correct. Wasn't 
that under the National Science Foundation

25:59.637 --> 26:01.680
program? I think so. And that Mr. Heaton was told by 
Rutter, so I understand, to call each faculty

26:07.735 --> 26:16.225
member a day in advance and say, tomorrow when you 
meet class, you will have a black student there.

26:16.265 --> 26:16.966
Don't worry. There is no reason this student has 
been admitted, is fully competent. And there was

26:24.075 --> 26:25.797
not a single problem. And so when the fall semester 
began, nobody could say it wouldn't work. It

26:29.181 --> 26:30.503
worked nicely that summer. I can't respond to the 
calling that you indicated, Mr. Heathman. I'm not

26:36.357 --> 26:37.819
aware of it. Having not been in admissions at that 
time, I could have been certainly left out of that.

26:43.207 --> 26:47.054
I can tell you that there were absolutely no 
incidents. Yeah, I never heard of it. The only

26:48.556 --> 26:58.752
incident that I'm aware of, and this was some 
couple of years or so after the time period you're

26:48.556 --> 26:58.752
talking about, was the One night in the library 
there were some blacks who had checked out some

26:59.423 --> 27:12.056
books and there was something very minor about how 
they returned the books or that sort of thing. Very

27:12.076 --> 27:17.822
little talk and no demonstrations of any kind that 
I'm aware of at all. All right. What about some

27:18.983 --> 27:26.691
anecdotes about the admission of women gradually 
becoming more and more inclusive? Do you remember

27:27.091 --> 27:27.912
any? Well, one of the main things that I remember 
was that, as you well know, at that time, all of our

27:28.297 --> 27:39.254
registrations were being held in Subesa's dining 
hall. And there was a card in the registration

27:39.274 --> 27:44.983
packet that the females had to sign. And it had to be 
notarized by someone in the line of registration.

27:48.929 --> 27:51.633
We would hire eight, ten notary publics. It would 
be right at the end of the exit of Subesa, and the

27:51.653 --> 27:57.021
student left to turn their packet in. And on those 
cards would be questions like, do you solemnly

27:57.608 --> 28:14.623
swear that you are a daughter of a faculty or a staff 
member, and that you cannot find this program at

27:57.608 --> 28:14.623
any other institution in the United States, and I 
don't know two or three other things. So I remember

28:15.564 --> 28:19.668
that side of it. After the 1963

28:26.600 --> 28:37.034
And when Mr. Runner made his decision, you know, 
there were dislikes from the admission of women to

28:26.600 --> 28:37.034
Texas A&M. You could know, I think, about the 
stories of former students that were unhappy and

28:37.054 --> 28:45.946
some of them took their Aggie rings off and didn't 
wear them again, that sort of thing. But

28:45.966 --> 28:50.172
internally in the office, no discussion. No 
discussion at all about it. I think it was accepted

28:52.355 --> 28:53.316
that It took a while for the female enrollment

28:53.600 --> 29:04.130
to grow, but I don't recall any. Okay, now let's 
move on forward with your career as your duties

29:04.150 --> 29:14.379
tell me about how they grew and personnel changed. 
Well, in 1967, I guess, yeah, two years after I'd

29:14.680 --> 29:20.485
been there, I was talking with Mr. Heaton 
constantly all this time about we have to do

29:21.443 --> 29:28.993
something with Mr. Heaton. Mr. Heaton, bless his 
heart, was not of the computer age. Back to your

29:35.361 --> 29:40.808
earlier statement about a lot of it was being done 
by hand. It was basically all being done by hand.

29:43.921 --> 29:57.095
And there had been a horrible relationship 
between the Office of Admissions and Records and

29:43.921 --> 29:57.095
the Data Processing Center. There was some bad 
feeling there. Most of it was done prior to my time,

30:00.819 --> 30:13.573
so I can't give you a whole lot of history about it, 
except I do think that part of it was simply because

30:00.819 --> 30:13.573
of the bid. The individuals that were there, that 
had been there for so many years and had been doing

30:13.958 --> 30:24.971
it a particular way, simply bucked them. They 
didn't want to change. And they didn't want to

30:27.875 --> 30:36.585
change a lot, I think, because they had not had the 
good fortune to have been educated in what

30:27.875 --> 30:36.585
computers could do. And so

30:38.187 --> 30:42.632
part of my A good number of my responsibilities, of 
course, was working with the data processing

30:43.220 --> 30:49.090
center. And I'll never forget the first time I 
walked in that building down there. It was ice. I

30:54.219 --> 31:03.034
mean, it was obvious to me immediately that there 
was some real problems between our office and the

30:54.219 --> 31:03.034
computer center. I worked hard down there, and I 
had taken computer courses myself, so that helped

31:04.094 --> 31:15.950
my relationship with the computer center, and 
particularly Bob Smith, who was the director of it

31:04.094 --> 31:15.950
at that time. I got well acquainted with him and 
told him that this is my mission, this is what I want

31:16.671 --> 31:27.626
to do, and I'm working on the other end up here with 
Mr. Eaton to get this done. And so Bob Smith often

31:27.646 --> 31:32.312
referred to me as being... their salvation in the 
registrar's office. So it took me a while, but we

31:36.759 --> 31:40.058
got that.
