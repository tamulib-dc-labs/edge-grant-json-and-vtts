WEBVTT

00:01.904 --> 00:15.961
You

00:01.904 --> 00:15.961
know,

00:01.904 --> 00:15.961
we have gone for federal funding for a lot of 
things. And we have gotten some UDAG funds. We have

00:19.265 --> 00:22.028
gotten some EDA funds. We have gotten some urban 
transit funds,

00:22.108 --> 00:31.219
manpower programs. public works projects that we 
have. And we go on and on and on. That includes

00:40.564 --> 00:51.116
drainage and flood control through the U.S. Board 
of Engineers. Of course, the Federal Highway

00:51.136 --> 00:56.823
System. So, yes, we are more involved with the 
federal government

01:02.182 --> 01:06.487
. The Settlement is 100% federal. And there you had 
a direct relationship with, I guess, two

01:11.474 --> 01:20.084
presidents at that time, Kennedy and Johnson.

01:23.309 --> 01:30.357
Nester, could you briefly describe how your 
department is organized, the basic structure of

01:23.309 --> 01:30.357
it? Sure. When I took over the department, we had 
the traditional hierarchy of organization. We

01:39.594 --> 01:46.645
had the director, the assistant director, and we 
had eight or ten divisions. We had subdivisions,

01:47.126 --> 02:00.066
zoning, transportation,

01:47.126 --> 02:00.066
relocation, graphics, cartography. 
traditional system. After my assistant director

02:03.521 --> 02:26.946
of planning retired Mr. Bill Adams in 1980, early 
1983, I reorganized the office to change the whole

02:03.521 --> 02:26.946
pattern of it. I felt that the office should not 
have, or that it was rather impractical to have the

02:29.510 --> 02:41.006
director and the assistant director and then all 
of the subdivisions. So I reorganized with a

02:41.606 --> 02:51.720
director and three division chiefs.

02:54.755 --> 03:18.487
The three division chiefs, having to beat Joe 
Rubio, Judy Price, and Ned Kompis, all have under

02:54.755 --> 03:18.487
them several subdivisions that are grouped 
together by

02:54.755 --> 03:18.487
the nature of work that they do. For example, Joe 
Rubio handles everything that has to do with The

03:24.320 --> 03:33.535
plant commission has to do with now things, today 
things, subdivisions, zoning, site plan

03:24.320 --> 03:33.535
reviews, special permits.

03:36.019 --> 03:49.500
Everything that has to do with the development 
aspects that is ongoing right now has to do with

03:36.019 --> 03:49.500
annexations that are ongoing. So that is what is 
commonly known as current planning. And I put Judy

03:57.352 --> 04:06.002
Price in charge of comprehensive planning and 
transportation, transportation and . She

04:06.703 --> 04:08.485
actually wears three hats.

04:11.349 --> 04:19.639
She is the chief of comprehensive planning, she is 
the MPO for the city, and she is the person in charge

04:20.615 --> 04:31.066
of the major thoroughfare plan or all 
thoroughfare planning in the city.

04:31.086 --> 04:48.343
So she has under her wing demographics, she has 
encompassed planning and everything that has to

04:31.086 --> 04:48.343
do with transportation including doing the 
grants for the public transit system. Then I have

04:53.297 --> 04:58.663
the third, which is Ned Comfort, who is in charge of 
urban design. And urban design is involved with

05:00.384 --> 05:13.639
graphics, cryptography, design plans that are 
ongoing today. such as downtown revitalization,

05:14.362 --> 05:26.653
such as neighborhood revitalization, such as 
doing neighborhood commercial and housing

05:14.362 --> 05:26.653
programs. He's also in charge of relocation, 
which goes very well with this. So that's

05:34.600 --> 05:36.821
basically how I have it set up. The neat thing about 
this particular program that I have is that I took

05:45.901 --> 05:55.930
the assistant director position and divided its 
powers into the three and promoted the three. And

05:58.012 --> 06:15.267
they are not only supervisory in nature, but they 
are also working technicians, working

05:58.012 --> 06:15.267
professionals that realize that they are not only 
in charge of their division, But they are also

06:15.854 --> 06:30.288
required to produce work instead of being

06:15.854 --> 06:30.288
the overseer, which generally an assistant 
director, that's what he does.

06:33.471 --> 06:42.300
You talk to your assistant, and your assistant 
then turns around and assigns and sees that things

06:33.471 --> 06:42.300
get done. But in very few instances do you have an 
assistant director of any department feel that,

06:43.057 --> 07:00.116
aside from general supervision, that he is not 
expected to do it. One question that I want to be

07:01.017 --> 07:10.448
sure to ask you is, taking a look into the future, 
what

07:11.879 --> 07:15.523
future direction do you see for El Paso's 
planning? Are there any changes in the wind? Or any

07:19.208 --> 07:23.192
changes that you feel are most likely to occur?

07:26.116 --> 07:39.051
First of all, I have a very strong feeling that

07:26.116 --> 07:39.051
we are very, very short-handed manpower. How many 
staff do you have? I have approximately 36 right

07:42.208 --> 07:46.294
now, 35 or 36. And out of that, how many would you 
classify as professional planners?

07:55.745 --> 07:57.027
Give or take 12. I mean, truly professional 
planners in various processes, for comp planning

07:58.208 --> 08:07.620
or subdivisions and that sort of thing. My biggest 
complaint is that the city of El Paso is growing.

08:14.727 --> 08:15.948
We're half a million people. We are extremely 
tight in terms of personnel. We have lost some very

08:22.298 --> 08:25.843
key people in the past several months. And there is 
no help in sight that I can see to request

08:27.425 --> 08:37.320
additional personnel. As I mentioned to you in the 
beginning, back in the 60s, we enjoyed some

08:37.908 --> 08:49.761
excellent manning tables for the department. We 
had more help than we needed. Consequently, we

08:54.682 --> 08:59.707
used to carry two or three vacant positions from 
year to year. Planner twos and planner threes,

09:00.568 --> 09:04.212
which is, you know, top of the line. And nobody 
really cared whether you would carry these vacant

09:05.433 --> 09:11.800
positions from year to year. You'd say, well, 
yeah, I've got two or three positions vacant, but I

09:11.820 --> 09:16.846
won't fill them next year. Today, it is...

09:23.065 --> 09:28.290
It is just, you know, if you have a vacant position 
and you go to the budget, you're going to lose it.

09:29.512 --> 09:30.673
It's going to be wiped out. To get another body in 
the department is going to be extremely

09:31.894 --> 09:41.745
difficult. So what I'm really saying is as the city 
grows bigger and bigger, we're getting skimpier

09:42.325 --> 09:50.794
and skimpier, and that is the biggest challenge 
challenge, problem, the planning problem is

09:53.069 --> 09:57.634
facing right now. That's number one. By

10:00.938 --> 10:22.924
not fulfilling the overall mission of planning, 
it is entirely possible that we could lose some

10:00.938 --> 10:22.924
clout with the mayor and council. You know, you can 
just do so much with what you have and you're going

10:24.575 --> 10:44.962
to from time to time become, you're going to slip or 
you're going to not do the job that you would like to

10:24.575 --> 10:44.962
do. Consequently, your image, credibility, this 
political position in the organization may They

10:55.456 --> 10:56.077
get hurt. That's a fear. Because historically 
here, planning has played a major role in local

10:59.282 --> 11:06.152
government. And it would be a shame if now through 
personnel shortages and so forth, that were to

11:07.894 --> 11:15.986
change. That's a possibility. There's also a... 
danger that

11:25.207 --> 11:48.944
the Public Works Office may be gaining

11:25.207 --> 11:48.944
political clout and may position to hurt the 
Department of Planning. That's my personal

11:48.984 --> 11:51.788
observation. There always seems to be kind of a 
historic rivalry between the two departments in

11:52.612 --> 12:02.828
every city, subtle or overt. Sure. And it's just 
natural because of all the departments, we seem to

12:03.068 --> 12:15.228
be able to understand a more comprehensive view of 
the city. It probably works. kind of six or eight

12:17.924 --> 12:30.456
major departments under his belt, like streets, 
sanitation, traffic and transportation,

12:17.924 --> 12:30.456
engineering, public works. There's another one 
in there. So you're talking about what is

12:34.661 --> 12:41.768
generally classified as a super department. And 
so there's obviously more interest or there's

12:48.502 --> 13:03.847
more interplay between that and the middle 
council than a pure, simple department.

13:03.867 --> 13:06.031
I'm going to have to leave, too. I got to go. Aside 
from the personnel and the possible diminution

13:13.561 --> 13:17.104
of, as it were, clout in the city. Do you see any 
other changes in the future planning in El Paso?

13:22.889 --> 13:29.055
The type of planning or the way you spend your 
resources?

13:31.477 --> 13:32.018
Not really. I think the biggest challenge of your 
contact is to keep up with development changes

13:44.189 --> 14:13.318
where we are, you know, in rhythm with the rest of 
the country in terms of innovative ways of doing

13:44.189 --> 14:13.318
things such as performance standards, for one, or 
performance zoning, new PODs, new residential

13:44.189 --> 14:13.318
developments requiring flexibility as opposed 
to the traditional zoning districts.

14:14.986 --> 14:30.266
I think we need to keep an open mind without 
hindering

14:14.986 --> 14:30.266
quality. For instance, the big issue of narrower 
streets, where you don't need bigger streets, a

14:32.309 --> 14:44.925
hierarchical streets program, smaller lots, 
higher densities. changing patterns of

14:45.783 --> 14:53.630
community development, which is our business. 
What I'm saying is I'm hoping that we can at least

14:54.911 --> 15:05.459
keep an open mind and be able to stay up with current 
events. The other issue is to get fully

15:07.281 --> 15:10.063
computerized.

15:12.365 --> 15:15.688
We are promised that this year we will be 
computerized in plenty. We've been fighting for

15:15.871 --> 15:19.918
computerization for the last two years.

15:22.542 --> 15:29.575
Things work slow, but I think we will be able to 
persuade the Mayor and Council to do something.

15:29.895 --> 15:33.802
We're very close to obeying that. Minister, thank 
you very much. I appreciate it.

15:42.432 --> 15:43.854
He was tired, I think, yes. Well, he's always 
tired, what a job. Tired, tired, you're always

15:46.016 --> 15:47.778
tired. Now let's see if this is recording.

15:53.964 --> 16:03.674
This is March 15th, 1985, and we are in the kitchen 
of Mrs. Jonathan Cunningham, otherwise known as

15:53.964 --> 16:03.674
Ann. And Mrs. Cunningham followed the career of 
her husband quite closely. And Ann, I want to ask

16:10.107 --> 16:18.515
you, would you recall how it was that you and 
Jonathan first met? And then take it from there to

16:19.216 --> 16:29.946
the early years of his career, and then all of that, 
and then how it came to be that you located in El

16:19.216 --> 16:29.946
Paso. Yes. I recall well that we met as graduate 
students at the University of Chicago. We

16:39.908 --> 16:43.053
attended lectures together. In fact, one man I 
distinctly remember, Rexford Tugwell, gave a

16:43.834 --> 16:54.652
fine planning lecture about his work in Puerto 
Rico. Jonathan and I shared many happy memories of

16:56.175 --> 17:02.305
the University of Chicago, where he was LD White's 
administrative assistant and instructor in one

17:02.723 --> 17:15.825
of his many fine classes in public 
administration. Then John's role in World War II

17:17.187 --> 17:26.122
was with the military intelligence. He did a great 
deal of mapping. for the Air Transport Command in

17:29.842 --> 17:59.663
the South Pacific, received the Bronze Star Medal 
for his research and writing about air routes that

17:29.842 --> 17:59.663
could be used with efficiency and with great 
finesse, let's say, to bring troops and supplies.

17:59.896 --> 18:03.121
to the South Pacific during World War II. After the 
war, Jonathan went back to the University of

18:04.423 --> 18:16.420
Chicago and was an all but dissertation person in 
the field of public administration. Then his

18:17.642 --> 18:25.633
first professional job after the war was at 
Whitman College, where he taught political

18:17.642 --> 18:25.633
science. public administration, was indeed 
chairman of the political science department

18:25.951 --> 18:30.055
there. And at the same time, he assumed the duties 
of planning director for the little village of

18:30.135 --> 18:41.648
Walla Walla and did write their planning and 
zoning ordinance for them. Within a few years, he

18:42.989 --> 18:54.962
became so attracted to planning that he moved to 
Spokane, Washington, where he was director of

18:42.989 --> 18:54.962
county planning for about two three years and then 
we moved on to Olympia Washington where John

18:55.229 --> 19:18.840
became the first regional planner of the Puget 
Sound area and formed the Puget Sound Regional

18:55.229 --> 19:18.840
Planning Council one of the first regional 
planning councils in the United States as I

18:55.229 --> 19:18.840
remember We came to El Paso because John was 
essentially a Southwestern-er, basically,

19:18.989 --> 19:31.443
spiritually, in every way a Southwestern-er. He 
had a fine boyhood and youth in New Mexico and was

19:32.704 --> 19:42.315
attracted to the region always. When Mayor 
Raymond Telles invited him to be a planning

19:42.515 --> 19:46.600
director, Do you remember how Teas spelled his 
last name? T-E-L-L-E-S, Teas. When Teas invited

19:53.974 --> 20:07.333
Jonathan to be planning director, he was honored 
and sacrificed a good career in the Northwest and a

19:53.974 --> 20:07.333
bit of salary to come down and be planning director 
for the city of El Paso. And he delighted in the new

20:08.274 --> 20:10.638
challenge. It was indeed a challenge. And he, I can 
honestly say, really really

20:17.984 --> 20:27.856
loved his work in El Paso because it did demand the 
best of him. And he continually felt that because

20:28.597 --> 20:37.027
he knew the region, he could contribute a great 
deal to the planning efforts for this community.

20:38.909 --> 20:46.759
Well, John seemed to know how to relate to the 
people here in the Southwest, to all sorts of

20:38.909 --> 20:46.759
people. poor, rich, powerful, not so powerful, 
and he understood them. He was a people planner.

20:56.307 --> 21:01.713
And although he was not bilingual, he had many 
friends in Mexico and in Juarez. And he was liked by

21:02.855 --> 21:10.083
the Mexican-American population in El Paso very 
much. He was invited to their LULAC functions. He

21:14.629 --> 21:20.636
was invited to teach at the university in Juarez. 
They provided him with an interpreter,

21:20.736 --> 21:25.842
translator, excuse me. And he taught a course in 
city planning administration at UT El Paso and

21:25.822 --> 21:37.013
found time generally to serve the universities in 
the area. He also gave freely of his time and

21:37.073 --> 21:44.500
speaking ability to New Mexico State University. 
So he had a fine time here as a planner and as a

21:45.701 --> 21:51.087
professional teacher. Essentially, he 
conceived the idea of a fine city planner as also

21:55.420 --> 22:14.724
being a teacher because he felt that people needed 
to be educated as to what the real role of city

21:55.420 --> 22:14.724
planning was and what it could do for a community 
and what it ought to be thinking of doing and what

21:55.420 --> 22:14.724
its goal should be. So he made city planning not 
only a career, but he made it a teaching

22:14.804 --> 22:20.331
dedication. And on that, that reminds me of when I 
first met Jonathan in 1970 at the San Antonio

22:20.851 --> 22:34.009
conference of the Gulf Southwest chapter of AIP. I 
had just been authorized by the then president,

22:34.811 --> 22:48.630
Vernon Henry, to proceed with the development of a 
short course for planning commissioners. And

22:49.184 --> 23:01.238
Jonathan was one of the first supporters of such a 
move on the part of the chapter, because he did

22:49.184 --> 23:01.238
believe in education of planning commissioners 
and the general public. So he was on the original

23:01.818 --> 23:18.938
task force for the short course for planning 
commissioners, which, of course, now has evolved

23:01.818 --> 23:18.938
into the Educational Foundation, which is 
separately incorporated and is one of the

23:19.424 --> 23:25.593
probably one of the best activities that the 
chapter has to its credit. And it received a

23:25.673 --> 23:31.381
National Honor Award for the development of this 
short course. I'm glad to hear that, because he did

23:32.203 --> 23:39.753
feel it was extremely important. Now, I consider 
the acquisition of the Chamizal National Park one

23:39.773 --> 23:49.127
of Jonathan's great achievements for El Paso. He 
had good contacts in the Department of the

23:49.883 --> 23:54.790
Interior. And when he found out that there was to be 
a transfer of land between the two countries,

23:55.852 --> 24:10.434
Jonathan conceived the idea that land should be 
set aside within the city of El Paso for a national

23:55.852 --> 24:10.434
park. And he did indeed pursue that vigorously in 
Washington and did effectuate the idea and

24:19.769 --> 24:28.820
promote it and did get it for the city and it's still 
much used. It's a cultural center for the city. The

24:31.763 --> 24:49.084
administrator Frank Smith and John were good 
friends and Frank often tells me that if it were not

24:31.763 --> 24:49.084
for John that we would not have the Shamizel 
National Park there and it would not be such a a

24:49.672 --> 24:55.700
great inspiration to this community, which does 
need a great deal of cultural inspiration. Okay.

24:58.985 --> 25:19.273
Well, looking back on planning in El Paso since 
you've been here, several

24:58.985 --> 25:19.273
things have happened in addition to the Chamazul 
Park and the redefinition of the international

24:58.985 --> 25:19.273
boundary between Mexico and Texas. I

25:19.692 --> 25:33.526
think you mentioned previously that there was a 
series of neighborhood parks that were promoted

25:19.692 --> 25:33.526
as a policy by John? Yes. He loved the city of 
Spokane because it had so many wonderful city

25:34.447 --> 25:41.454
parks. In fact, I believe Spokane, Washington is 
still noted for its numerous park plans and

25:41.554 --> 25:48.501
developments. When Jonathan came to El Paso, he 
did note immediately the few parks in the area. And

25:58.160 --> 26:09.234
this was one of his dedications to acquire and to 
develop more parkland for the city. And he was

26:09.534 --> 26:15.822
especially instrumental in getting the Armijo 
Park recreational center developed, which is

26:16.342 --> 26:22.991
used constantly in South El Paso. He promoted the 
idea with the park department director that we

26:23.872 --> 26:36.628
should have more parks, and he worked 
continuously with him. to acquire more parks for

26:37.267 --> 26:40.071
the city of El Paso. And although we haven't as many 
as Spokane, we do have our fair share and they are

26:40.111 --> 26:48.943
well located in every section of the city now. I 
know that he was an advocate of George Kessler's

26:51.187 --> 27:06.548
planning and caused an abstract of Kessler's 1925 
plan for El Paso to be reprinted. and distributed

27:07.152 --> 27:09.735
on the occasion of its anniversary. And as such, he 
also advocated comprehensive planning and made

27:10.937 --> 27:32.764
sure that El Paso moved constantly in that 
direction rather than in the direction of the

27:10.937 --> 27:32.764
currently more popular type of policy plans. 
Would you like to comment on that? I know that

27:37.223 --> 28:02.131
whenever he had a chance, whenever he had people 
who could write that he could depend upon on his

27:37.223 --> 28:02.131
staff, he tried to update the plan for El Paso and 
worked so hard to do that and to get a consensus of

27:37.223 --> 28:02.131
view and approval for his plans. Each year he 
published

28:07.801 --> 28:35.935
report too from the city planning department of 
the achievements of the past year and noted what

28:07.801 --> 28:35.935
had been done with maps and illustrations so that 
anyone wishing to keep track of the city planning

28:07.801 --> 28:35.935
department and know what how the city was growing 
and what planning was being done could consult

28:07.801 --> 28:35.935
those publications he was very proud of the 
publications that came out of his office and they

28:36.488 --> 28:44.098
were well done, well written, and beautifully 
printed. I think it would be a good idea to be able to

28:45.480 --> 28:50.726
use excerpts of some of those in the book. Yes. Yes, 
my daughter and I are planning to catalog the

28:52.989 --> 29:01.500
publications we have and they are numerous. 
Jonathan was with the department for 20 years and

29:02.375 --> 29:29.783
he did publish and I'm sorry that he's perished but 
some of his ideas live on and he's still well

29:02.375 --> 29:29.783
thought of in the community and many do speak to me 
and tell me that they appreciated his efforts on

29:02.375 --> 29:29.783
behalf of this city.

29:30.539 --> 29:33.102
El Paso doesn't have a city manager. And I heard it 
said some years ago that the nearest thing that El

29:34.884 --> 29:52.766
Paso had to a city manager was Jonathan, because he 
considered planning to be so important with

29:34.884 --> 29:52.766
respect to the political arena. And he kept close 
to it and kept the mayor and the council informed

29:58.096 --> 30:06.346
and more or less served as the planning arm of the 
city council and the mayor, particularly the

29:58.096 --> 30:06.346
mayor. Well, his concept of what the city needed 
here was, I believe, an interdepartmental

30:07.527 --> 30:22.245
communication route

30:07.527 --> 30:22.245
of ideas. And he did set up, as I recall, meetings 
for the department heads of the city to discuss and

30:26.210 --> 30:48.644
promote and inform each other of what they were 
doing so that there was never a lack of

30:26.210 --> 30:48.644
communication between department heads of the 
procedures in various departments. And this, I

30:48.765 --> 30:51.168
understand, was helpful. No, Jonathan really was 
not. a city manager in essence he was an

30:55.100 --> 31:20.668
understated person many times with his equals and 
superiors he was looked to for advice by as you

30:55.100 --> 31:20.668
pointed out businessmen and men who were just 
beginning to develop as leaders in this

31:21.273 --> 31:25.309
community.
