WEBVTT

00:02.326 --> 00:05.070
to see that everything is working, testing, 
testing. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,

00:05.371 --> 00:07.915
eight, nine, ten. This is Thursday morning, 
October of the 30th, and I have the pleasure and

00:10.078 --> 00:21.837
honor of chatting with John Sharp, whom I remember 
as a fine, fine student leader here. to introduce

00:22.981 --> 00:28.830
yourself to anyone who may listen or read this 
material in the future. Describe your family

00:29.491 --> 00:31.915
background. Where'd you grow up? Where'd you go to 
high school? What did parents do? Introduce

00:34.719 --> 00:35.801
yourself to them. I grew up in Placido, Texas, 
population somewhat under 200, maybe somewhat

00:36.142 --> 00:41.770
under 100. It's a little town in Victoria County, 
just south of Victoria. There were two towns south

00:46.898 --> 00:49.242
of Victoria, one Bloomington. And that's where 
all the people lived that didn't want anybody to

00:49.829 --> 00:53.334
know they drank whiskey. And Placido is where 
everybody lived that had the whiskey stores. And

00:56.838 --> 01:03.127
so the stores stayed open until quite late at night 
to allow the folks in Bloomington to come over

00:56.838 --> 01:03.127
without being seen. My father worked 38 years as a 
gauger in the oil field for Magnolia and then later

01:04.068 --> 01:12.019
Mobile Oil in the oil fields around Vanderbilt. My 
mother was a teacher for nearly 30 years, fifth

01:12.059 --> 01:19.549
grade teacher in Bloomington Elementary in 
Placido. elementary school. My mother went to the

01:22.283 --> 01:24.065
University of Texas. My father didn't go to 
college. He was wounded in World War II in the

01:26.568 --> 01:34.698
island of Leyte in the Philippines and was in the 
battles of New Guinea. And my brother also didn't

01:35.860 --> 01:38.964
go to college. My sister graduated from the 
University of Texas and I'm the first of my family

01:38.984 --> 01:48.215
to go anywhere other than the University of Texas, 
including all cousins and everybody else. They

01:48.235 --> 01:49.637
all went to the University of Texas. I was in high 
school. Manuela Gutierrez one day just nominated

01:55.572 --> 02:00.577
me for class president and nobody else was. And so I 
became it and I guess got used to it. And so in high

02:04.482 --> 02:08.926
school I was student body president in several 
things. And which high school? Bloomington High

02:09.787 --> 02:18.477
School, which is at the time, it would be 2A now, but 
my graduating class, 52 kids. When I was 11 years

02:19.469 --> 02:30.901
old, I will never forget it, my mother was very, 
very insistent that at a very young age we decide

02:19.469 --> 02:30.901
what we're going to be and bye George, all these 
kids are going to go to college. And I remember I had

02:32.022 --> 02:37.528
a lot of animals and including tons of pigeons. I 
raised homing pigeons when I was just a little kid.

02:40.411 --> 02:43.294
One of them got run over on the side of the road and 
broke his wing. And I took a Popsicle stick and

02:44.475 --> 02:47.518
stuck it together And it must not have been broken 
very badly, because about eight weeks later, the

02:47.920 --> 02:52.246
pigeon was flying again. And I can remember it as if 
it was yesterday, because it is the reason I went to

02:52.906 --> 02:57.773
A&M. The pigeon was flying. My mother, on her daily 
insistence, I was watching the pigeon fly. The

03:05.522 --> 03:06.644
pigeon's name was Pidge. I thought that was an 
amazing deal. She did, too. And she said, you know,

03:10.088 --> 03:11.931
you ought to be a veterinarian. And I said, OK, Mom. 
suits me fine. I was 11 years old. I'll just be a

03:16.422 --> 03:17.483
veterinarian. Where do I go to school to be a 
veterinarian? She said, you have to go to a place

03:19.325 --> 03:24.171
called Texas A&M University, which I've never 
heard of or been to. And I said, great. Now that

03:26.694 --> 03:32.601
that's settled, I can get on with fourth grade or 
whatever I was in at the time. And she started

03:33.562 --> 03:37.106
telling everybody, oh, John's going to go to A&M. 
He's going to be an Aggie. And for Christmas, I

03:38.208 --> 03:41.772
started getting these Aggie sweatshirts and 
Aggie paraphernalia. By the time I was in high

03:43.271 --> 03:47.197
school, that was a very foregone conclusion. And 
that's where I was going. Still had never seen the

03:49.520 --> 03:50.921
place. My teacher my senior year was Mabel White, 
whose son later was a congressman. His name was Joe

03:58.371 --> 04:00.534
White from that area. W-Y-A-T-T. W-Y-A-T-T. And 
he was a state representative that I eventually

04:00.734 --> 04:05.921
replaced. And my mother taught him, and his mother 
taught me. And she was the outstanding teacher of

04:09.950 --> 04:15.198
the year in Texas when I was in high school. And she 
came to me one day and she said, you don't want to be a

04:15.218 --> 04:17.821
veterinarian. And I said, you're right, Ms. 
White. I can't stand the sight of blood. I can't

04:22.208 --> 04:25.433
believe I'm going to go somewhere and be a 
veterinarian. She said, you should be in

04:25.473 --> 04:28.417
government. She gave me this little test. And she 
probably made it up. But anyway, the test said

04:31.421 --> 04:33.224
that. And about that time, I came to A&M. I went to 
the vet school with my father, my very first trip.

04:40.443 --> 04:44.648
And first meal was at the Whataburger over here on 
Highway 6. Went to see the veterinarian. He said,

04:46.430 --> 04:47.711
why do you want to be a veterinarian? And I said, 
well, I guess because they make a lot of money. And

04:51.436 --> 04:55.881
he said, you don't want to be a veterinarian 
because you're not going to make very much money as

04:51.436 --> 04:55.881
a veterinarian. And I said, works for me. I'm out of 
here. It was literally like that. I said, Mrs.

05:00.226 --> 05:01.988
Wyatt was right. And so I became a liberal arts 
major. And then Gary Halter. was my advisor, who

05:09.687 --> 05:17.256
remains a good friend, and he talked me into 
majoring in political science later on. The

05:19.418 --> 05:21.681
Corps, I didn't know anything about the Corps. I 
mean, I knew nothing about anything, but on that

05:21.941 --> 05:32.674
trip, I noticed I saw a whole bunch of uniforms, and 
there was a bunch of signs of people running for

05:21.941 --> 05:32.674
office, and I was kind of interested in all that 
kind of stuff. And on the way back, we picked up a

05:34.223 --> 05:40.192
hitchhiker who was in uniform and had a little 
Aggie maroon and white bag. And we get him in the

05:41.273 --> 05:52.109
car, me and a guy named Mike Olson, who came here one 
year and then didn't make it and went to some other

05:41.273 --> 05:52.109
school, I think ANI or someplace after his grade. 
And I asked that guy, I said, what is this core

05:53.070 --> 05:55.894
thing? And he said, you are just going to love it. So 
it is just great. I said, you know, my mother was in a

06:00.605 --> 06:06.812
fraternity, a sorority, and all my uncles and all, 
they thought that was a lot of fun. I said, this is

06:06.832 --> 06:09.315
ten times better than fraternity. If you want to be 
anything at A&M, you've got to be in the Corps. And I

06:11.978 --> 06:13.460
said, well, you just talked me into it. And I was 
literally filling out the little form, and I just

06:14.020 --> 06:18.125
checked Corps. And so that's how I wound up at A&M. I 
wish I could say, yeah, I was, you know, huge family

06:22.081 --> 06:30.154
background, and boy, they are all, you know, ten 
generations of Aggies, but it wasn't true. It was a

06:30.214 --> 06:30.855
pigeon. Alright, so you enrolled in the fall of 
1968. Describe

06:34.280 --> 06:40.370
that coming up here. Who brought you? What stuff 
did you bring with you? You're not going to believe

06:43.235 --> 06:45.338
this story. This story probably shouldn't be in 
the archives, but you're looking at the only kid

06:46.297 --> 06:57.167
that brought a fishing pole to fish camp.

06:57.707 --> 06:59.028
That's marvelous. I knew so little about it. I 
showed up at the YMCA. This guy in the car said we

07:04.553 --> 07:12.060
should go to fish camp because you're going to 
learn an awful lot there. I met at the YMCA. My dad

07:15.760 --> 07:18.542
gave me a hug, dropped me off at the YMCA, and left. 
And there was this crowd of people. I'm going, what

07:19.924 --> 07:21.265
in the world is this? I must have looked real lost. 
And a guy named Chris Shaw, who you might have

07:23.787 --> 07:27.890
known. He and Capron were good friends. He was 
pretty active in student government and SCONA and

07:29.672 --> 07:33.975
some of that stuff. He was one of Wayne Stark's 
boys, you know. And he came over and he said, you

07:37.598 --> 07:39.820
look kind of lost. Where are you from? I told him, 
Placido. He said, I'm from Garwood. And we became

07:42.623 --> 07:43.864
instant friends. He was the first guy that I met. 
And so we went to fish camp. Turns out when we get to

07:49.360 --> 07:58.188
fish camp, the family that owns the land there was,

07:49.360 --> 07:58.188
I forget their name. I think their name was Giles. 
Anyway, she was my teacher. She was my English

08:02.432 --> 08:04.073
teacher in high school. It turns out that she was 
walking around there. I said, what are you doing

08:06.035 --> 08:06.976
here? Now, fish camp was held up near Palestine. 
Palestine. And so anyway, we went through fish

08:11.180 --> 08:13.662
camp and then Best thing I ever did. I mean, I would 
recommend it highly to every kid that can because

08:14.957 --> 08:26.355
it gave me a sense of what everything was about and, 
you know, kind of put it all in perspective. When

08:26.375 --> 08:32.284
you came to stay, what other stuff did you bring in 
addition to the fishing pole? Oh, I brought the

08:32.304 --> 08:33.465
stuff. I brought the stuff that they told me, you 
know, they, you know, foot locker full of, you

08:34.187 --> 08:40.015
know, all the stuff. So that was pretty easy. It was 
everything. I do remember, though, dragging that

08:42.211 --> 08:53.401
footlocker down the hall and I was still a high 
school Harry, you know, hadn't been taken to the

08:42.211 --> 08:53.401
level that you're supposed to be as a fish, you 
know. And I remember dragging it down the hall and

08:54.122 --> 08:58.386
this guy said, he kept hollering, Fish Jones, Fish 
Jones. And I knew he wasn't talking to me and my

08:59.587 --> 09:01.629
name's not Jones. And then eventually I figured 
out he was talking to me, but that was the wrong

09:01.689 --> 09:06.433
name. So I turned around and said something like, 
hey, Frank, how you been? He said,

09:10.038 --> 09:12.929
blankety-blank, my name's not Frank, and so my 
name's not Jones either. And he turned out to be the

09:12.969 --> 09:21.482
first sergeant of the outfit, so we got off to a real 
good start.

09:22.643 --> 09:27.951
Did, as your parents left, did they give you any 
advice? Well, my mother didn't come up. She said

09:30.454 --> 09:32.497
her goodbyes at home. No, my dad's real quiet. He 
just, you know, he drove me up there, left me off at

09:33.980 --> 09:38.526
the YMCA building. That may have been, except when 
he was dating my mother, the only time he was on a

09:40.669 --> 09:45.176
college campus. I mean, he had never, except for 
that first trip in the spring, you know, when we

09:45.296 --> 09:52.026
came up and learned about the corps and 
everything. That was only his second trip and he

09:53.361 --> 09:59.870
dropped me off at the YMCA and wanted to get the heck 
out of the traffic and get back to Placido, Texas.

10:00.050 --> 10:03.375
Alright, how did you get from the YMCA to whatever 
outfit? Well, we went to fish camp from there and

10:04.055 --> 10:14.470
then when we got back from Palestine they had 
assigned us all outfits and we were all in Do you

10:14.737 --> 10:18.702
have any idea how you came to be assigned to the 
outfit you were in? Any reason for it? Yeah,

10:19.743 --> 10:28.513
because I had put down veterinary medicine and 
everybody in the outfit, in the spring I put down

10:19.743 --> 10:28.513
veterinary medicine and everybody in the outfit 
was agriculture. Everybody was agriculture

10:28.853 --> 10:30.735
except me. And by that time I'd already changed to 
liberal arts so I was in an outfit with ag-eco

10:31.536 --> 10:42.769
majors and agronomy majors and all those guys were 
from ranching families from the country as I was,

10:43.525 --> 10:51.793
but I was the only fish that was something other 
than an agriculture major. And what outfit was it?

10:53.675 --> 10:54.455
Squadron 6. Did it have a nickname? Savage 6. 
Savage 6. Flying Tigers. Flying Tigers. I bought

11:00.441 --> 11:03.184
the last six t-shirts. They abolished it several 
years ago, I think, because of grades. The day

11:07.588 --> 11:11.732
before they abolished it, I came down and bought 
the last six t-shirts Lupo had. I still have them

11:11.772 --> 11:12.773
for What was it like in the first few weeks to be a 
fish? Oh, horrible. Describe. I thought I'd

11:20.257 --> 11:21.778
landed on another planet. I just said, who are 
these people? Oh, it was just, you know, it is one of

11:25.241 --> 11:30.887
those things I'm real glad I did. Whether or not you 
would show me those circumstances again and I

11:31.988 --> 11:38.755
would go back and do that again, I hope I would have 
the courage to do it again. But the physical part, I

11:38.795 --> 11:41.397
didn't mind. It was the mental part. stuff that was 
the toughest, you know, somebody screaming at you

11:43.381 --> 11:47.747
all the time. As you look back though, this is the 
best thing that ever happened to me because the

11:48.347 --> 11:59.462
core really does have the system down. You know, 
you heard a bunch of people say, oh, they did away

12:00.043 --> 12:08.173
with paddling or they did away with, you know, 
physical hazing or getting them up at 2 o'clock in

12:00.043 --> 12:08.173
the morning and running to the airport. That 
didn't matter. That isn't the stuff that trained

12:09.483 --> 12:10.926
you. What trained you was you took all these high 
school heroes like me, most of which were

12:10.986 --> 12:32.305
something in high school or football stars or 
something like that, and took us down to a level

12:10.986 --> 12:32.305
that weighed down, just stripped us of all 
pretenses and pride and everything. and then

12:32.926 --> 12:39.833
allowed us to work our way up as sophomores and 
juniors and seniors. And it was, it's some of the

12:39.893 --> 12:45.900
best leadership, it's the best leadership 
formula I've seen. And I think that's why so many

12:45.960 --> 12:56.571
people come out of their, not just excelling in the 
military, but excelling in business, you know,

12:57.091 --> 12:58.813
Whatever they get in. You had a fish-hole lady in a 
room. Describe who that was and what your room was

13:02.056 --> 13:04.879
like. What was in your freshman room? Just four 
walls and a window and a little heater at the end. I

13:13.349 --> 13:14.930
had several.

13:17.854 --> 13:22.018
I had, my first roommate was a guy named Johnson. 
but he was gone after the first semester. His

13:25.116 --> 13:28.622
grades got real bad and he was gone. And then my next 
roommate was a guy, a good guy named Glenn Honaker.

13:34.231 --> 13:34.852
Still Honaker. H-O-N-A-K-E-R from Fort 
Stockton. He's now in charge of like the largest

13:40.544 --> 13:44.069
pecan orchard that exists on the planet. I mean, 
it's just huge. If you fly over to Fort Stockton,

13:45.491 --> 13:50.979
you'll see all this greenery on one side, and 
that's his pecan orchards, him and another guy.

13:53.503 --> 14:03.758
And my last roommate was, before I went on core 
staff, my last roommate was Chris Roberts, who

13:53.503 --> 14:03.758
remains one of my very best friends, as does Glen. 
And he's head of the Federal Land Bank near Lubbock

14:04.479 --> 14:09.606
out there. And Chris is from Tohoka, which means 
bad water. He lives in level land right now. And we

14:19.555 --> 14:22.599
were roommates until my senior year. My senior 
year, I was elected student body president and

14:22.659 --> 14:32.352
chosen to be on as programs officer for core staff. 
And my roommate there was Ray Kopecky, who was the

14:32.372 --> 14:39.762
inspector general, little fireball from 
Pasadena. that everyone in the Corps loved to hate

14:40.822 --> 14:46.008
because he was Inspector General and would show up 
at your doorstep at 6 o'clock in the morning.

14:46.649 --> 14:56.240
During that first fall, were you a victim of what 
today would be defined as hazing, and if so,

14:46.649 --> 14:56.240
describe some of it.

15:00.205 --> 15:06.332
Yeah, I thought hazing was getting up at 6 in the 
morning with a whistle blowing in your ear. Yeah, I

15:06.372 --> 15:09.175
mean, we had We had, it was all pretty good natured. 
I mean, we, I learned how to do a couple hundred

15:12.013 --> 15:16.859
pushups pretty quick that I never thought I could 
do. And so we had to do that stuff. And yeah, if we

15:18.340 --> 15:29.773
messed up bad enough, we'd go, we'd all have to go 
out on the hall and, or in the steam showers or

15:18.340 --> 15:29.773
something and, you know, grab butterflies, which 
was not the best thing for your knees, I guess. And,

15:29.873 --> 15:31.395
and. Any paddles used? Only. Only at the end of the 
year when everybody knew this was a

15:35.007 --> 15:45.665
rite of passage from being a fish to something 
else. That's the only time when everybody kind of

15:45.705 --> 15:48.669
agreed to it. We were a pretty cautious outfit. One 
of the reasons for that is the first week we were

15:51.514 --> 15:59.147
here we had an Air Force qualifying test. It wasn't 
hazing. We had to run a mile for Air Force ROTC, and

16:01.720 --> 16:18.721
in that mile, I was running along with a guy from 
Hondo, one of the best guys in the world, named Tom

16:01.720 --> 16:18.721
Stein, and I looked at him as we were going to the 
finish line, and he was turning blue, and I looked

16:01.720 --> 16:18.721
at him and I said, Tom, are you okay? And he got to the 
finish line and died. It was the first death that

16:22.126 --> 16:31.137
year on campus, and he died right next to me and our 
first sergeant, Bill Hall, was the first one there

16:22.126 --> 16:31.137
and tried to give him artificial you know, 
respiration and it just didn't work. And he, so he

16:33.918 --> 16:36.581
died with all of us looking at that. And aside from 
the loss of Tom, it was the first silver taps that

16:37.201 --> 16:52.416
year, aside from the loss of him, it was, you know, 
everybody was in the back of their mind was saying,

16:37.201 --> 16:52.416
well, what if they had just had us out, you know, 
running because somebody did something. And that

16:52.456 --> 16:57.020
I think weighed pretty heavily on those 
upperclassmen's mind that whole year. And so we

16:57.060 --> 17:00.043
didn't, we didn't, uh, There wasn't anything out 
of the ordinary, I mean, I don't think. Let's go to

17:06.058 --> 17:08.181
the child hall now as a freshman. Describe the 
routine there. The routine there, that's my worst

17:11.046 --> 17:12.929
place. I absolutely hated the place. And that is 
one of the primary reasons that I became involved

17:15.873 --> 17:20.680
in student government. Because after about two or 
three weeks of that, I looked up the rules and said,

17:21.181 --> 17:27.330
okay, how do you get out of this? I mean I got tired of 
eating under the table and being screamed at while

17:29.595 --> 17:32.958
I was eating. My food just didn't digest very well 
while I was being screamed at. And so I would find

17:37.003 --> 17:57.064
the Apollo Club that met breakfast on Monday and I 
would find which club met on Tuesday and which club

17:37.003 --> 17:57.064
met in the evening and by the time that first 
semester was over with I was racking up lots of

17:37.003 --> 17:57.064
points for the outfit in terms of the numbers of 
clubs that I I joined. The chow hall was just

17:57.999 --> 18:00.883
absolutely nerve-racking for me. I never ever got 
used to it. And I would always find someplace to

18:03.286 --> 18:05.750
eat. There was a 7-Eleven or something over here 
and I'd go over there and get a piece of bologna and

18:05.910 --> 18:14.662
cheese and eat that and go to my meeting. And I lost 
27 pounds my freshman year, my first semester. I'm

18:20.791 --> 18:24.216
not a big fan of Duncan Dining Hall. Did you and your 
buddies ever attempt any pranks that freshman

18:24.854 --> 18:29.120
year in the child hall?

18:32.865 --> 18:33.606
No, not in there. We kept ours at other places. What 
about some of that good bull? Well, we

18:39.534 --> 18:47.825
had one of the guys in my outfit that lived across 
the hall from me. We used to always say we were

18:49.428 --> 18:51.731
roommates, but we never were roommates. It was 
Rick Perry. We were in the same outfit. And one of

18:54.065 --> 19:07.440
the things that happened that I'm sure we'll all 
deny is we had this one particular upperclassman

18:54.065 --> 19:07.440
that was a real jerk. And everybody knew he was a 
jerk. And we knew if we did something to him, nobody

19:08.621 --> 19:11.925
would get too mad. And so Rick found some M80s 
somewhere. Some what? M80s, big firecrackers,

19:19.314 --> 19:23.278
just a little short of dynamite, I guess. And we 
discovered that if you go up to the second floor

19:24.085 --> 19:34.363
above the bathrooms, that they were all linked 
together. All four floors of the bathrooms were

19:34.443 --> 19:36.387
linked together. And if you dropped that lit, it 
would stay lit, and flushed it, that it would

19:36.427 --> 19:44.581
explode somewhere around the next one. And so my 
job on that particular Saturday morning was to

19:49.010 --> 20:14.612
because we knew he came in and read the paper on 
usually stall number two and I sat there and waited

19:49.010 --> 20:14.612
for him to come in he came in he sat down and I simply 
held two fingers out for Mr. Perry who was above us

19:49.010 --> 20:14.612
and I heard the flush above and I just kind of sat 
there and watched and it literally vaulted him off

19:49.010 --> 20:14.612
the camo Thank God the door was open because the 
door flew open and he was laying there with his

20:15.976 --> 20:28.167
underwear around his ankles on his all fours with 
the newspaper broken around his neck. And I was

20:28.688 --> 20:32.211
just sitting there, oh my God, we killed this poor 
bastard. I mean, we killed this guy. And I just

20:34.613 --> 20:36.495
left. I mean, I went up there and I just went to my 
room and cowered in the corner. And Rick comes in

20:40.219 --> 20:41.860
and said, how'd it work? I said, man, you just 
wouldn't believe it. But it was a serious impact. I

20:49.299 --> 20:56.326
mean, that water in a little inch and a half pipe all 
coming out that one commode was awesome. It was one

20:56.346 --> 20:58.729
of the more awesome displays of nature. So he 
really wasn't hurt? Well, he wasn't hurt, no. But

21:01.192 --> 21:03.594
he never, ever, ever figured out. But he never 
changed. He always was like that. And so Christmas

21:06.137 --> 21:13.945
time, Christmas time we did get some chickens. And 
after he left, we had been in there doing push-ups,

21:14.785 --> 21:25.378
and we took the door hinges out, and we put pencils 
in there so that you could just kick it in and break

21:14.785 --> 21:25.378
it, and he never noticed it. So he left for 
Christmas. We stayed an extra few hours. And when

21:28.802 --> 21:35.730
he did, we put four or five chickens in his room with 
enough food to last a month and plenty of water and

21:28.802 --> 21:35.730
stuff like that. And you can imagine what his room 
looked like when he got back. It was not very

21:39.915 --> 21:40.896
pretty. Where did you all get the chickens? 
Somewhere over in... In Poulter Science? No, we

21:46.704 --> 21:52.832
actually went and got them from some farmer around 
here, I think toward Milliken, somewhere like

21:46.704 --> 21:52.832
that. You mean y'all bought them? Oh yeah, we paid 
good money for those chickens, a buck or two

21:55.596 --> 21:58.680
apiece. An honest cash transaction. Oh yeah, we 
didn't steal the chicken. That's good. What was

22:06.770 --> 22:12.518
special about, as you look back, what was special 
about those chickens? though you were praising

22:12.802 --> 22:21.553
the Corps, what did those first two or three years 
do to you and your personality that were

22:12.802 --> 22:21.553
important? Well, I think what the Corps does is it 
teaches you, it operates on the theory of in order

22:22.754 --> 22:35.370
to be a leader, you've got to know what it feels like 
to be led. And I think that's what I think that right

22:37.186 --> 22:39.309
there is what makes it special. All the other stuff 
is kind of side benefits. You get to make long

22:41.432 --> 22:45.939
lasting friends that are going to be your friends 
forever and ever. And the closeness and the

22:45.999 --> 22:51.948
camaraderie in the spirit. I think the Corps has a 
special role. If you had asked me back then, if you

22:54.733 --> 23:00.882
had told me in 1972 on the day that I graduated in May 
that, you know, this school is going to be 50,000

23:01.402 --> 23:10.271
kids and 2,000 or less are going to be in the core. 
You think they'll still stand up for football

23:10.892 --> 23:12.774
games? You think they'll still do all, have 
midnight yell practice? I said, in no way in the

23:15.897 --> 23:18.240
world that would exist. And the fact that that is 
just as strong or stronger than it ever has been

23:20.202 --> 23:30.953
before, I think is a testament to the kind of kids 
that come here, but I think it also is a testament to

23:20.202 --> 23:30.953
the core maybe kind of keeps the fire stoked and and 
stuff and as part of it uh academics uh you you know

23:31.878 --> 23:59.286
you gradually you gradually shifted or or you 
shifted from veterinary medicine well i never

23:31.878 --> 23:59.286
never never never signed up for veterinary 
medicine so that you shifted over the summer you

23:31.878 --> 23:59.286
registered the first semester liberal arts as 
liberal arts And do you remember some courses that

23:59.502 --> 24:03.208
first fall?

24:06.794 --> 24:09.999
Courses and or instructors or advisors? My 
favorite political science professor was Gary

24:10.400 --> 24:13.845
Halter. I thought he was really good. I liked his 
courses a lot. I didn't get into his until I was into

24:19.194 --> 24:24.362
my sophomore year and stuff like that. But my best 
course, funny you should ask this, that I did the

24:25.152 --> 24:33.522
worst in was American history. And we had this 
professor that had this unbelievable

24:34.103 --> 24:41.232
photographic memory of the Civil War. And it was so 
fascinating. And I'm not saying this because this

24:43.295 --> 24:45.878
professor is in the room. But it was so fascinating 
that I never took a note. I sat in the back of the

24:49.402 --> 24:50.664
class. I remember that class specifically. I sat 
in the back of that class. just mesmerized at how in

24:54.194 --> 25:00.842
the hell does this guy remember the dates and stuff 
of all this stuff. And we would look at each other

25:00.862 --> 25:05.628
and we refought the Civil War right there in that. 
And I never had any of that in high school, you know.

25:09.634 --> 25:12.918
And that was the best course I took at A&M. It really 
was high school. And there's lots of kids that will

25:14.340 --> 25:17.143
say the same thing. Best course I took. But I think I 
got a D in it. I never took a note and I could not

25:23.405 --> 25:28.398
remember those damn dates that you were always 
asking for on the test.

25:31.146 --> 25:34.174
And trivia, was Rick in that same section? I don't 
know. I don't know if he was or not. Probably, I

25:37.860 --> 25:39.502
don't know. It was a required course, wasn't it? 
Everybody had to take History 1, but there were

25:41.584 --> 25:43.907
many sections. I don't know. This is a big, big... 
There must have been 300 kids in this thing. I think

25:48.652 --> 25:51.595
I had both of y'all in class. I'm not sure, but I 
think I did. Probably so. That would have been our

25:54.278 --> 25:57.462
freshman, sophomore year freshman, maybe? 
Probably freshman. Freshman, yeah. Because that

25:59.404 --> 26:05.009
was normal for a liberal arts, you know, kind of the 
general. Do you remember? It was American

26:07.171 --> 26:08.332
history, right? Yeah, yeah. Do you remember how 
many hours you normally took per semester? A heck

26:12.576 --> 26:14.878
of a lot more than my kids taking now. I mean, I took 
18 and it wasn't any big deal. I graduated on time,

26:19.702 --> 26:25.187
but the only way I graduated on time was I went to a 
couple of summer schools. And now my son, who is

26:25.353 --> 26:43.693
going to the wrong school, UT, TU, you know those 
kids take 12 hours and 14 hours and if they get past

26:25.353 --> 26:43.693
15 they go, oh my God, we're going to stress these 
kids out and they can't make it anymore. But I, you

26:44.373 --> 26:52.822
know, I'm wondering if one semester I didn't take 
21, but I knew I took 18 many different times.

26:53.163 --> 26:55.225
Describe Particularly your freshman year if you 
can. But what was the typical routine for you on a

26:57.784 --> 27:02.492
class day? What time did you get up? What did you do? 
When? I guess the whistle started blowing at, I

27:04.576 --> 27:11.208
don't know, I guess it was damned early. It seemed 
like to me six, I'm guessing.

27:16.535 --> 27:20.500
would put on a uniform, double-check each other, 
make sure there weren't any smudges. Did you have

27:20.941 --> 27:25.066
any upperclassmen's room you had to care for that 
fish year? No. And then I went out on the hall to be in

27:27.670 --> 27:35.520
the squad that you were in, and then some, you know, 
sophomore comes by. We use nice terms for the

27:35.540 --> 27:37.583
archives. Some sophomore would come by, check us 
all, scream as all of us. We were fortunate in my

27:41.829 --> 27:45.073
squad that we had this one kid named Merritt, I 
don't think he was there after the first semester.

27:49.307 --> 27:52.771
But he just delighted in wearing white socks with 
his uniform. And they screamed at him all the time.

27:55.454 --> 27:56.596
And he just loved it. I was not one that was big on 
loving that. But they screamed at him most times.

28:01.042 --> 28:02.083
So anyway, we'd go out there. They'd inspect us, 
ask us a lot of questions, ask us what was on the

28:02.123 --> 28:15.280
inscription on Guyon Hall, the inscription on 
Lawrence Sullivan Ross, all this kind of stuff,

28:02.123 --> 28:15.280
the definition of a freshman, all this kind of 
stuff, all of which I still remember. and then went

28:16.120 --> 28:20.047
out into formation in the quad. Corps staff walked 
by. We marched to Mourning Child, did that bit,

28:22.131 --> 28:32.070
came back, cleaned up your room, got it ready for 
inspection in case somebody was going to come by.

28:32.860 --> 28:35.945
And then went to class. And for the first semester 
of our fish year, we were required to come back for

28:36.686 --> 28:43.256
noon. They did away with that because classes just 
didn't start matching after the first semester,

28:43.296 --> 28:48.904
which I thought was great. One more time, I didn't 
have to go in that place. And usually we'd go to

28:51.508 --> 29:00.842
class until then, and then I would always have some 
meat that night. At the end of my freshman year, a

29:01.497 --> 29:17.834
bunch of guys in the outfit, there was a guy named 
Kirby Brown, who is now the Director of Public

29:01.497 --> 29:17.834
Relations for Parks and Wildlife, was a fish class 
president then. Some guys in my outfit came to me

29:19.015 --> 29:25.362
and some upperclassmen said, hey, you ought to run 
for sophomore class president. I said, what makes

29:26.388 --> 29:28.732
you think I'm uniquely qualified to do that? And he 
said, well, your name, Sharp, you can do so much

29:28.752 --> 29:32.578
with it. And I said, yeah, you know, I bet that's 
right. You know, everybody's always asking me,

29:35.303 --> 29:38.067
are you Sharp, Chris Sharp, and all this kind of 
stuff? He said, yeah, you've got a great name. And

29:39.329 --> 29:42.094
so there were four or five people running. So I put 
my name in, and we printed up a bunch of signs that

29:42.114 --> 29:47.263
said, look Sharp, think Sharp, vote Sharp. And we 
plastered them all over the corps. Didn't put them

29:51.143 --> 29:52.605
anywhere else. You know, I don't know if anybody 
else voted for me on the civilian side. But then

29:56.550 --> 29:58.071
won. And then in that, then got to know Caperton and 
Lane Cruz and all of those folks. That was kind of a

30:06.141 --> 30:10.687
whole new world because I was also in the student 
senate at the time. And then at the end of my

30:10.787 --> 30:18.716
sophomore year, ran for student life chairman, 
which I guess, I don't know if they still have that

30:10.787 --> 30:18.716
or not. It's kind of a cabinet deal. And then, and 
Roger Miller was student body vice president, who

30:21.113 --> 30:27.821
was real close to Kent. And Roger and I met once a 
week and told each other we wouldn't run against

30:28.322 --> 30:31.566
each other. Both of us knew the line. And then when 
the time came, sure enough, Roger and I ran against

30:34.149 --> 30:39.476
each other for student body president. And Roger 
made one very terrible mistake, and that is the

30:39.656 --> 30:49.568
week before the election, we were both being 
interviewed by the battalion. And they asked

30:50.442 --> 30:56.490
Roger, I said, Roger, would you be willing to 
consider any alternatives to the bonfire? And

30:56.931 --> 31:03.159
Roger, being the open-minded kind of guy that he 
is, said, well, yeah, I'd consider some

30:56.931 --> 31:03.159
alternatives. And they asked me, and I said, well, 
of course not. That's heresy. Wouldn't do it and

31:07.225 --> 31:08.587
all this kind of stuff. And that was it. I mean, I 
could have gone fishing that last week because it

31:09.949 --> 31:13.193
was over with then. Do you remember what the margin 
was in the election? It was pretty serious. I mean,

31:19.296 --> 31:22.225
the Corps was really being sensed. The Corps and 
Walton Hall and Hart Hall and all those people.
