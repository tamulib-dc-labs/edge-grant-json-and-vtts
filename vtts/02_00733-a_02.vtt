00:07.591 --> 00:24.316
How could a visitor to the NM campus who was totally 
unaware, perhaps, of the difference between,

00:07.591 --> 00:24.316
say, a freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior, 
how could he tell what was what without asking

00:07.591 --> 00:24.316
somebody? Freshman wore a fish stripe on his 
sleeve, but they usually were pretty easy to

00:26.198 --> 00:34.911
identify anyway. Uh-huh. Sophomore usually was a 
corporal in the Corps, had had corporal stripes.

00:44.538 --> 00:49.485
Junior had sergeant stripes, and so forth. At one 
point, I think there was a junior pin that was

00:49.505 --> 00:58.879
fairly prevalent on campus, seemingly, that the 
juniors could wear. Well, they had freshman pins.

01:01.683 --> 01:07.872
I don't know whether they had sophomore pins or 
not, but the freshman I got the concession one year

01:08.223 --> 01:11.708
for selling freshman pins. It was a little gold pin 
in the shape of a fish. And it was quite profitable.

01:19.840 --> 01:21.883
Selling the pins, I guess. Yes. But it was an 
optional thing then, not everybody wore one.

01:26.771 --> 01:28.153
Yeah. OK. I think you've talked a little bit about 
this, but perhaps there are some other things.

01:35.804 --> 01:38.366
What did you do for entertainment and recreation?

01:42.571 --> 01:59.509
Well,

01:42.571 --> 01:59.509
I had no time to engage in too much entertainment 
and recreation, but there was the

02:00.367 --> 02:25.659
recreation usually was in the nature of some sort 
of horseplay and games

02:00.367 --> 02:25.659
that you played and

02:00.367 --> 02:25.659
intramural activities and so forth. But the truth 
is there was very little time for any formal

02:29.729 --> 02:31.010
education. The old YMCA had one

02:31.791 --> 02:40.642
or two pool tables and they weren't used very much.

02:43.405 --> 02:58.302
I think, as I look back on it, that I was so busy with 
the things I had to do that I didn't have time to

02:58.990 --> 03:02.134
look for entertainment. But

03:02.154 --> 03:13.449
were there other students who did have more time, 
or was it a general rule that almost everybody

03:02.154 --> 03:13.449
worked? No, no, no. There were a good many that 
didn't work. Most of them didn't. I would say that

03:21.720 --> 03:27.968
they, in their off time, that they just

03:28.808 --> 03:34.194
fool around. Uh-huh, had a good time in the 
dormitory. Okay, what about occasional dances?

03:43.626 --> 03:58.343
Yes, we had some dances that were big occasions on 
the campus those days, and

03:43.626 --> 03:58.343
they were well attended. and uh well run i don't 
remember ever uh

03:59.183 --> 04:28.077
seeing anybody take a drink of whiskey and that 
sort of thing it of course in those days if you got

03:59.183 --> 04:28.077
caught with it you were automatically expelled 
and they were very well uh run uh occasions and we

03:59.183 --> 04:28.077
look forward to those dances and uh Most of us would 
invite our girl to come and we emptied some of the

04:28.563 --> 04:40.056
dormitories and let the girls stay in the 
dormitories. And it was usually a two day occasion

04:41.158 --> 04:48.666
to enjoy. And we had some of the best bands that were 
available at that time. And I remember one time we

04:58.887 --> 05:02.252
had Ligon Smith. There's not many people I know 
that are old enough to remember Ligon Smith, but it

05:02.332 --> 05:09.482
cost us $800 to get his band down there. I remember 
that.

05:13.688 --> 05:22.280
Did the Corps of Cadet officers have any special 
privileges not enjoyed by, say, other

05:13.688 --> 05:22.280
upperclassmen? Well, I don't know. They had...

05:28.368 --> 05:38.641
a good deal of delegated authority and sometimes 
they felt that they didn't have enough and I'm sure

05:28.368 --> 05:38.641
they did have. They primarily did what then? 
Enforce discipline within the armatory? Yes. Did

05:49.374 --> 05:56.383
they assign you extra drill if you were caught 
misbehaving? Or did somebody higher up have to

05:57.106 --> 05:59.229
assign that? I don't remember. They issued 
demerits. And when you got so many demerits, you

06:03.494 --> 06:07.018
had to work them off. And so the upperclassmen 
didn't actually assign the extra work, but the

06:08.260 --> 06:17.951
officers could give you demerits. I see. And that 
was for a number of things. If your room was not...

06:27.312 --> 06:36.405
orderly, where you got demerits, if you were late 
formation and things like that. Did

06:36.465 --> 06:44.357
you have any favorite instructors or professors 
at A&M? Yes, generally speaking I liked them all,

06:45.158 --> 06:52.088
but

06:45.158 --> 06:52.088
I You mentioned Charlie Crawford a while ago. 
Charlie Crawford was one of my freshman

06:56.248 --> 07:07.101
instructors, and we established a friendship 
that has continued till today. He was one of the

07:07.762 --> 07:13.570
greatest friends I ever had and one of the best 
instructors I ever had. And in my freshman year, I

07:14.751 --> 07:23.222
had Dr. Thomas Mayo as my English teacher. 
professor and

07:23.945 --> 07:50.577
Dr. Mayo took a special interest and

07:23.945 --> 07:50.577
he organized the debating club and the literary 
club and

07:23.945 --> 07:50.577
I did join his literary club for occasional book 
reviews and that sort of thing. I didn't have

07:55.348 --> 08:21.340
joined the debating club because I didn't have 
time, but Tommy Mayo was also the head librarian,

07:55.348 --> 08:21.340
and I went to work in the library dusting off and 
putting up the books at $16 a month and for so many

07:55.348 --> 08:21.340
hours a day, and I've always said that I absorbed a 
good deal of knowledge putting up the books in the

08:21.758 --> 08:28.144
library.

08:30.786 --> 08:41.055
Well, I'm interested to hear your comments about 
Mr. Crawford because he's one of the retired

08:30.786 --> 08:41.055
professors whom I know quite well, and I find him to 
be an interesting and helpful sort of man. 13 years

08:41.075 --> 08:49.403
after I graduated, he persuaded me to enroll for 
obtaining

08:50.159 --> 09:18.698
a professional degree, which I don't believe they 
still give, but it consisted of enrolling in the

08:50.159 --> 09:18.698
fall, preparing and writing a thesis, and 
standing examination at the graduation in the

08:50.159 --> 09:18.698
spring. And I did that. And I have, I think, one of 
the few professional degrees. Your

09:28.006 --> 09:35.094
qualifications were a certain amount of 
experience before you could enroll for this

09:28.006 --> 09:35.094
degree. But I have kept in touch with Charlie 
Crawford all through the years and knew his family

09:35.935 --> 09:47.487
well and admire him very much. The other professor 
that I would,

09:48.715 --> 09:59.325
that I recall that I was very fond of was Mr. Brewer. 
I've forgotten his initials. He was in the

10:01.307 --> 10:05.931
mechanical engineering department. He first 
taught me lab courses, and then in my senior year in

10:06.532 --> 10:15.600
mechanical engineering, we had a group who 
elected to specialize in railroad engineering.

10:21.911 --> 10:27.481
And he was an old railroad man before he came to A&M, 
and he taught this class. And although it had

10:28.583 --> 10:36.637
nothing to do with my career later on, I enjoyed 
this work under Mr. Brewer.

10:40.584 --> 10:41.385
What... Attitudes did the students have towards 
the administration, say the president of A&M? Dr.

10:47.417 --> 10:48.819
Brazell, I believe, was president. Dr. Brazell. 
Well, their attitude was

10:50.602 --> 10:56.351
both good and bad. Dr.

10:56.371 --> 11:09.432
Brazell had some difficulty in having... had 
experience as president of a girls' school and had

11:09.665 --> 11:20.338
some difficulty in getting the viewpoints of the 
boys. And there was occasions

11:20.538 --> 11:38.659
when the situation got pretty rough, and the boys 
were not always respectful. some of them, and

11:39.753 --> 11:57.575
there was, I guess,

11:39.753 --> 11:57.575
occasions when it looked like we were going to have 
a riot and he threatened to close the school down

11:39.753 --> 11:57.575
and that sort of thing. When I first came to A&M 
three years ago, I had the impression that Dr.

11:58.837 --> 12:07.127
Brazell was really a top-notch man, And then one of 
the other former students, and I've forgotten

12:07.327 --> 12:13.955
just exactly who it was now, but I believe it was Mr. 
Height from Austin, brought me an issue of a kind of

12:14.035 --> 12:24.629
an underground student newspaper called The Lung 
Bat, which came out in 1924 while Dr. Brazell was

12:14.035 --> 12:24.629
still there. And they complained about all sorts 
of things, Charlie Nietzsche's laundry and the

12:25.229 --> 12:33.840
confectionery. And then they had an editorial in 
which they sort of said they were complaining

12:33.820 --> 12:43.477
about censorship, I believe, of the newspaper. 
And they said that, well, and, you know, the

12:43.517 --> 12:53.314
inability of students being able to get up and say 
what they really thought. And they said... that if

12:55.758 --> 13:06.131
you don't believe us, why get up in the middle of the 
academic building and say what you think, and then

12:55.758 --> 13:06.131
see, look how long it is till the next train comes 
through, and that's how long you'll be here. Well,

13:06.491 --> 13:08.854
we had some of those kind of problems. I really was 
very fond of Dr. Brazell, and I remember I even

13:09.515 --> 13:18.887
visited him after we went to Oklahoma University. 
He was a learned man and an educator, but he didn't

13:25.593 --> 13:30.979
always know how to best handle a bunch of boys. 
Perhaps he really hadn't had the background

13:31.279 --> 13:39.507
experience for handling a bunch of boys of that 
size, of that type of school. I think that pretty

13:39.627 --> 13:44.673
well explains it. Were there any new traditions? 
Of course, you know, Mr. Colonel Ike Ashburn was

13:50.479 --> 13:54.823
commandant in those days, and He was one of the most 
effective men that I've ever known and got to be a

13:55.394 --> 14:05.091
very good friend of mine even up until he died after 
he left A&M. But he was the real

14:06.894 --> 14:13.926
strength of the administrative part of the 
discipline and administrative part of the

14:14.075 --> 14:24.727
student activities and did a fine job. So would 
then maybe the editorial and the long bat been

14:25.107 --> 14:30.633
aimed more at the Colonel Ashburn than at Dr. 
Bazell? No, I don't think so. In

14:34.698 --> 14:43.187
those days, it was easier.

14:43.623 --> 14:47.592
You were expelled for things that you wouldn't be 
expelled for today, possibly. And hazing was the

14:48.735 --> 14:56.173
biggest reason for expelling the students. And 
every time a group would get caught in the act, and

15:00.717 --> 15:04.761
get expelled from school, that would stir the 
whole corps up. And that's when these

15:04.781 --> 15:11.447
riotous situations seem to exist. Now, what I was 
starting to ask is, were there any new traditions

15:12.589 --> 15:17.874
started while you were a student at A&M? I know 
there's lots of things that are carried on today,

15:17.974 --> 15:25.481
such as the bonfire that started well before you 
were there, a number of other things. Well, I don't

15:26.422 --> 15:27.683
recall. It just seems to me that The traditions 
were there and are still there, maybe somewhat

15:30.940 --> 15:41.423
modified as of today. They were there. I think one 
of the ones that I miss most, I did not attend A&M,

15:43.149 --> 15:50.759
but I came to the campus on a number of occasions. I 
was in a debating club at Texas Lutheran when I was a

15:50.859 --> 15:59.150
student, and we came to A&M on several occasions 
for the debate tournament here. And one of the

15:59.350 --> 16:07.320
things which always impressed me was the friendly 
greetings that you got from every student as you

15:59.350 --> 16:07.320
encountered him on the campus. This would have 
been in the early 50s. Yes. But you don't get that

16:09.944 --> 16:11.646
today. Well, more so than you do in other schools, 
but... Yeah, I think more so than in other schools,

16:12.655 --> 16:20.845
but it's, I think, unfortunately, rapidly dying 
out. Well, numbers have something to do with that.

16:26.492 --> 16:37.725
I think there was only about 2,000 students 
enrolled when I was there, and I believe I knew the

16:26.492 --> 16:37.725
nickname of most of them. I had a job delivering 
telegrams, and... It

16:42.389 --> 16:46.735
was all over the campus. And in my sophomore year, I 
had a job at telegrams and library and mess hall.

16:56.988 --> 16:57.970
Three jobs in one year. I had a little excess money 
for the first time. Of course, in my senior year, I

17:03.297 --> 17:06.321
had the hamburger stand. That was the famous 
hamburger stand. Yes. Could you tell us a little

17:10.446 --> 17:12.569
bit about that hamburger stand? Well, yes. It was 
those students who could prove the need for some

17:15.412 --> 17:28.849
help were allowed to draw with others that had been 
selected. And I think there must have been about 25

17:29.740 --> 17:37.732
or 30 of us who qualified to draw for the 
concession. The one who drew the concession was

17:38.934 --> 17:55.360
permitted to buy the stand from the one who had had 
it, not on any negotiated price, but on the same

17:38.934 --> 17:55.360
price that he paid for it. I drew, Colonel Todd was 
then a commandant, and we went to his office, and I

17:56.183 --> 18:10.182
had to deal with my roommate, who also qualified to 
draw, that you had to have a partner. So then I

18:11.243 --> 18:14.968
selected my partner in advance, and he selected me 
in advance. See, one of us got it, we were partners.

18:18.132 --> 18:18.893
So I drew it. Number 25 was a lucky number, and I drew 
it out of the hat. Well, I didn't have $250 to pay for

18:26.288 --> 18:46.916
it, and I wasn't old enough to borrow money at the 
bank, but I went over to the Brown Bank and

18:26.288 --> 18:46.916
explained my situation, and they said, well, we 
will loan you money if you'll get somebody to sign

18:26.288 --> 18:46.916
your note. I went back and talked to Tommy Mayo, and 
Tommy said, I'll sign your note. So he signed it,

18:51.742 --> 18:56.228
and I got the $250 and paid for the stand. And then, 
incidentally, that $250 paid off before

18:57.338 --> 19:04.245
Thanksgiving that year. But after I went to summer 
camp and coming back from summer camp, I stopped at

19:04.365 --> 19:16.237
college and the 4-H Club boys were there. And so I 
got Dad Cole, who worked for us and was engaged to

19:16.477 --> 19:23.264
work for us in the stand. We opened up the hamburger 
stand and split the profits three ways. We each

19:29.240 --> 19:37.167
made $50 that week, and I had enough money to buy a 
railroad ticket back to Dallas when it was over.

19:39.149 --> 19:51.601
Then when we graduated and lost the concession, 
the athletic department took over the hamburger

19:39.149 --> 19:51.601
stand. It always before had gone on a concession 
basis. Now, that was an experience for me. We sold

20:00.909 --> 20:13.923
hamburgers for 10 cents apiece, bought the ground 
meat for 10 cents a pound, and made about 4 or 5 cents

20:00.909 --> 20:13.923
profit on each hamburger. So it was quite 
profitable. What all did you put everything on the

20:17.106 --> 20:21.491
hamburger that you put on the day, like lettuce and 
tomatoes and onions? No, to me, that doesn't make a

20:22.132 --> 20:24.574
hamburger. That's a sandwich. A hamburger... is 
meat, bread, mustard, pickles, and onions. Now,

20:31.854 --> 20:42.403
at present time, they call them hamburgers, but 
it's not hamburger to me when they make a sandwich

20:31.854 --> 20:42.403
with lettuce and tomatoes and stuff. So that 
hamburger stand had been there for a number of

20:42.423 --> 20:47.307
years, then, I take it, before you got the 
concession. It had been there two or three years.

20:52.071 --> 20:54.873
And then you were the last one to have it before the 
athletic department took it? Before the athletic

20:54.893 --> 20:56.935
department took it over, yes. Did the people have 
to come to your stand to get the hamburger? Yes. You

21:04.081 --> 21:05.263
didn't deliver it to the dormitory? Well, each 
evening when I got through and went by, and if there

21:05.323 --> 21:24.868
was meat left over, I'd stay there and cook them up 
in hamburgers, and I sent my agents out in the

21:05.323 --> 21:24.868
dormitories and sold them. He gave them 15% 
commission. so that I could clean up the supply of

21:26.969 --> 21:33.436
meat every day. Then you had a number of people 
working for you, I take it? Yes, I had some student

21:36.660 --> 21:38.702
help. I paid them 25 cents an hour and all the 
hamburgers they could eat, which looked like a

21:38.842 --> 21:45.289
good job to them. Okay. Were there any girls in any 
of your classes when you were at A&M? No. They

21:54.179 --> 21:56.301
weren't... Prior to, well, I don't know how to time 
it. I remember Elaine Bazell graduated from A&M.

22:07.651 --> 22:11.875
She was the first girl, I guess, to get a degree from 
A&M. And in a period of time there, and maybe it was

22:13.477 --> 22:23.166
while we were there, the daughters of the 
professors could attend the classes on a day

22:24.142 --> 22:27.145
scheduled basis, but I had no girls in my classes. 
Uh-huh. It would depend, I take it, probably on the

22:27.566 --> 22:32.051
course that you were taking, whether you... Yes. I 
would think you might have had some in a literature

22:32.691 --> 22:35.094
class or something. Yes, maybe so. Well, I think 
Mr. Crawford's sister is the one who's usually

22:36.495 --> 22:41.260
given credit as being the first graduate. That 
could be. She's now Mrs. Ludeke, I believe. She

22:45.065 --> 22:50.490
finished in 24, but I don't believe she... She 
didn't participate in a formal graduation. I

22:50.551 --> 22:52.292
think she got a degree of some sort. Uh-huh. But, of 
course, there were some earlier who attended and

22:54.331 --> 22:59.518
completed the courses but didn't get anything. 
Yeah.

23:04.765 --> 23:08.910
You mentioned something a little bit earlier 
about the training table. Could you tell us a

23:10.853 --> 23:20.645
little bit about what this involved and what other 
privileges, say, the athletes had? Well, the food

23:20.665 --> 23:24.270
was very... They had steaks every evening, T-bone 
steaks usually, and it was quite an inducement to

23:24.892 --> 23:38.434
become a good athlete and make the training table. 
The training table wasn't open to everybody who

23:39.375 --> 23:43.362
went out for athletics. It was just available for 
the squad. In other words, by the squad, you mean

23:51.858 --> 23:57.084
this would be the fellows who played football who 
made the trips? Well, I don't know. I guess the

24:00.648 --> 24:03.170
limitations changed from time to time. But if they 
were active on the squad, they were on the training

24:04.912 --> 24:08.436
table. And they had their own dining room in the 
Duncan Hall, Duncan Dining Room in the attached, I

24:09.017 --> 24:19.308
mean, part of Spieser Hall. Uh-huh. Now, if you 
played football, were you on the training table

24:21.018 --> 24:26.505
the whole year or just during football season? Or, 
well, you could say about, you were on cross

24:27.706 --> 24:30.409
country, I believe, were you not? Yes. You made the 
training table. Did you eat at the training table

24:31.571 --> 24:35.816
the whole year or just during the cross country 
season? No, I don't believe it was for the whole

24:37.638 --> 24:39.961
year. But they,

24:41.122 --> 24:50.113
I don't recall how it was for the rest of the 
athletes. The football people, of course, they

24:50.768 --> 24:56.217
had spring practice, and they had the football 
season. And

24:57.480 --> 25:07.697
really, I guess it was, for the football players, a 
pretty year-round thing.

25:08.504 --> 25:10.726
Did the athletes have any other privileges? I 
mean, were they ever excused from drill or? Not,

25:14.270 --> 25:16.852
they weren't supposed to be. And they lived, when 
you were there, they lived with their company.

25:20.716 --> 25:21.137
Yes. This one was assigned to a company and he lived 
with the company. That's right. He was in a

25:24.000 --> 25:24.901
separate dorm. Yes. Okay.

25:32.588 --> 25:37.093
Were you on the cross-country team just one year or 
more than one? For

25:38.626 --> 25:47.317
one year, I believe, I developed a case of sin 
splints. I had to give it up. I wasn't on in my senior

25:48.218 --> 25:49.680
year. I was on my junior year. OK. Well, I think that 
sort of covers what I want to talk to you about while

25:53.665 --> 25:59.653
you were at A&M. Now, if time will permit, I'd like 
to talk with you some about what you've done since

26:00.334 --> 26:04.279
then. What was your first job? Well, my first job, I 
took a job at $100 a month

26:07.904 --> 26:18.894
working for the Continental Gin Company. I only 
worked six months for them, and I went to work for

26:20.095 --> 26:37.810
the Lone Star Gas Company, also at $100 a month, but 
work that I felt would give me an opportunity to

26:20.095 --> 26:37.810
become an engineer.

26:38.600 --> 26:48.635
But having taken mechanical engineering, I had no 
special qualifications in the petroleum field.

26:49.917 --> 27:06.902
But through experience and I obtained

26:49.917 --> 27:06.902
a

26:49.917 --> 27:06.902
reputation or an opportunity to become a 
petroleum engineer, and I was the first petroleum

27:07.304 --> 27:10.046
engineer that Lone Star Gas Company had. And I've 
been a petroleum engineer ever since and never a

27:10.106 --> 27:16.432
mechanical engineer. Did you take some 
additional courses somewhere while you were

27:16.452 --> 27:20.816
working for Lone Star Gas or something? No. Just 
experience? Experience. How long did you work for

27:23.598 --> 27:25.040
Lone Star Gas? Thirteen years. Then I came having, 
I came to Amarillo to take over the Shamrock Oil and

27:27.102 --> 27:36.670
Gas Corporation. which was about nine years old 
and had accumulated a total loss of $9 million. And

27:43.260 --> 27:47.365
I've been here ever since. I was first vice 
president and general manager and then president

27:47.585 --> 27:54.333
and then chairman of the board. What year was it 
that you came to Diamond, Chairman? 1938,

27:57.277 --> 28:02.843
December 1938.

28:03.802 --> 28:06.145
Are you still chairman of the board? I'm retired 
now. I remember before my retirement, we affected

28:08.148 --> 28:24.152
a merger with the Diamond Alkali people, and the 
company is now known as the Diamond Shamrock

28:08.148 --> 28:24.152
Company, chemical and oil business. They 
complement each other very well. It's a rather

28:29.080 --> 28:34.428
large corporation, going to do nearly a billion 
dollars worth of business this year. And I am

28:35.791 --> 28:46.047
still a member of the board of directors, but not 
active in the management of the company because of

28:35.791 --> 28:46.047
my retirement. I've been retired five years from 
active job. I think we're
