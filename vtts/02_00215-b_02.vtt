00:02.866 --> 00:19.164
Well, for the Army program, I know there was going to be a big drive to commission 10,000 lieutenants a year, which was a big increase over what they had.

00:19.184 --> 00:24.449
Now, this was back in the 70s, and we were doing very well here.

00:24.550 --> 00:26.832
We were commissioning about

00:27.385 --> 00:29.467
150 or more a year.

00:29.487 --> 00:33.252
I think now it's much less than that.

00:33.352 --> 00:35.615
But we were doing our fair share.

00:36.716 --> 00:44.185
And as far as the other services, I'm not sure what they were doing.

00:45.426 --> 00:54.557
I know in the Army they had a program where everyone wasn't needed on active duty, but you needed a lot of people in the reserve, National Guard and Reserve.

00:54.892 --> 01:01.798
And there was a program that if you wanted to, you know, just go on active duty for six months and be in the reserve of National Guard, you could do that.

01:02.639 --> 01:07.363
And our problem here was getting enough slots, reserve slots.

01:08.604 --> 01:15.570
A lot of the schools had problems getting, they had, they, people didn't want reserve slots, they wanted active duty.

01:16.231 --> 01:22.456
So I swapped out, I did a lot of swapping around, around the, this, the, what they call a third region.

01:23.277 --> 01:24.578
And I would call up,

01:25.199 --> 01:33.312
the fellow that was over me, and I said, listen, I need five or 10 of those reserve slots, and I think I got them on every occasion.

01:34.113 --> 01:43.888
So it was a matter of just kind of orchestrating how many slots you had, and if you didn't have enough, go out and get them other places.

01:44.589 --> 01:51.780
How difficult was it then, numerically, for a sophomore in the Corps to get a regular commission?

01:52.756 --> 02:00.905
Well, you had to be a distinguished military graduate, distinguished military student, distinguished military graduate, and I can't remember what it took to get that, a certain grade point ratio.

02:00.965 --> 02:01.726
Has that changed much?

02:01.786 --> 02:05.670
Recommendation by the, you know, by the instructors and so forth.

02:06.851 --> 02:09.194
I'm not sure that it had, it did change.

02:09.274 --> 02:11.316
I know I was a distinguished military graduate.

02:11.336 --> 02:12.858
That's how I got a regular Army commission.

02:14.319 --> 02:15.861
But we still put, you know, we've,

02:16.077 --> 02:19.806
They had the same badge, you know, that I had back in the 50s.

02:20.327 --> 02:30.572
And as far as you recall, numerically, those who met the standards didn't have any trouble getting a commission?

02:30.652 --> 02:30.853
No.

02:32.858 --> 02:34.221
Okay.

02:36.057 --> 02:42.302
And we began to have some women meet those standards and get commission and so forth.

02:42.322 --> 02:51.551
Were there some notable women, in a positive manner, were there some notable women who were pace-setters during your five years?

02:52.111 --> 02:52.591
Oh, yeah.

02:52.872 --> 02:53.612
There were several.

02:54.273 --> 02:56.935
You know, I've had a hard time thinking of their names.

02:57.316 --> 02:59.377
I can see them, but I can't think of them.

03:00.659 --> 03:04.222
One of them was, well, I really can't think of their names.

03:04.402 --> 03:05.743
I know one of them was named Julie.

03:06.331 --> 03:13.959
But she was an outstanding young cadet, and there was another woman in the same outfit, just truly outstanding people.

03:13.979 --> 03:15.761
There weren't any company commanders yet?

03:16.261 --> 03:17.162
Any outfit commanders?

03:17.182 --> 03:18.303
Yeah, we had outfit commanders.

03:18.323 --> 03:24.549
See, we had a W-1, which is the Army and Navy, and then we had Squadron 13.

03:24.569 --> 03:31.056
It was a 13, Squadron 13, which is a Squadron 14, the females.

03:31.357 --> 03:32.498
I mean, Air Force.

03:32.658 --> 03:37.144
Did the guys have nicknames for those outfits that can be recorded?

03:37.164 --> 03:38.485
Well, they call them the Waggies.

03:38.906 --> 03:40.507
The Waggies, yeah.

03:40.627 --> 03:41.949
They were all Waggies.

03:42.049 --> 03:44.592
It didn't make any difference whether Air Force or Army.

03:44.612 --> 03:49.918
But we had some, Sharon Mabry was one.

03:50.459 --> 03:52.621
It was, you know, I think she went to jump school.

03:52.701 --> 03:58.748
And we had them that would go to jump school and things like that and excel in summer camp.

03:59.588 --> 04:03.473
What about black students?

04:03.493 --> 04:25.839
I had very few blacks, but we had, I know one, Ray Jones, who was from over at Colwell, who became the regimental commander, I mean the brigade commander, the brigade commander, and he was just a super, you know, no, Bill Jones, I don't, his name was Bill Jones.

04:27.641 --> 04:29.123
And he was just a super cadet.

04:29.896 --> 04:33.984
And we had a few others, but he was probably the most outstanding.

04:34.004 --> 04:39.956
As far as you were aware, were there any ethnic or racial problems in the court?

04:39.976 --> 04:41.158
I never had any.

04:41.218 --> 04:47.671
I know we had some, like a fellow that was over, one of the band company commanders was Hispanic.

04:48.353 --> 04:49.575
They called him Taco.

04:50.129 --> 04:57.115
And his outfit had T-shirts, Tacos Rangers or Tacos Bunch or something like that.

04:57.155 --> 05:02.220
You know, they were real proud of the fact that he was their commander, super young man.

05:02.680 --> 05:05.242
Were there any problems that somebody was Jewish?

05:06.443 --> 05:09.426
Well, see, no one knew who were Jewish.

05:09.846 --> 05:18.254
It's like I told you, I think, earlier that I had some friends and I didn't even know they were Jewish until I got to be a junior, probably a junior or something.

05:18.274 --> 05:19.495
I just happened to see it in the...

05:19.762 --> 05:21.324
in the Aggieland.

05:21.664 --> 05:24.507
In your Commandant days, did we have many overseas students?

05:25.688 --> 05:26.449
Not very many.

05:26.469 --> 05:27.189
There were few.

05:27.250 --> 05:45.128
I know that we had one student from Honduras who, we made a deal with Honduras for him to be commissioned, and we got special permission for him to take Advanced ROTC and go to summer camp, Oscar Aviles.

05:45.148 --> 05:49.532
And he, incidentally, his uncle,

05:50.407 --> 05:53.772
was the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of Honduras.

05:55.013 --> 05:58.638
And he was later assassinated in Honduras.

05:58.698 --> 06:03.445
But this fellow was commissioned in the, we commissioned him on the stage there.

06:03.465 --> 06:11.175
And this general from Honduras came up and we commissioned him in the Honduras Army right there on the stage.

06:11.355 --> 06:12.697
I think I remember that.

06:13.238 --> 06:16.262
The, now we didn't have,

06:17.828 --> 06:29.323
during your five years, we didn't have the President of the United States visit or the Vice President or anybody from Mexico or any other didn't go through any of that.

06:30.424 --> 06:43.701
What kind of routine for gubernatorial inaugurations and that march by the RVs and so forth?

06:43.985 --> 06:52.055
inaugurate, one of the inaugurations, and I can't even remember who it was that was being inaugurated, but we took the RVs over there.

06:52.075 --> 06:56.341
Of course, they did the honor guard and all that, and we took the cab over.

06:57.282 --> 07:04.551
They marched in the inauguration parade, and the Aggie band was over there, and they marched in the inauguration parade.

07:06.153 --> 07:10.819
But I can't remember, I don't know who the governor was at that time.

07:10.934 --> 07:13.757
It might have been John Connolly, I'm not sure.

07:13.818 --> 07:18.824
No, no, it was either Mark White or Clements, I suspect.

07:18.844 --> 07:19.825
I bet it was Clements.

07:19.845 --> 07:22.388
Because Clements was elected while Jarvis was governor.

07:22.488 --> 07:25.071
Yeah, I think it must have been Clements.

07:25.091 --> 07:27.254
It was about 1980 or something like that.

07:27.274 --> 07:27.695
Let's see.

07:28.636 --> 07:30.298
You mentioned the Sabre incident.

07:30.378 --> 07:30.999
What is that?

07:31.900 --> 07:38.528
Well, at the home football games, well, at all football games,

07:39.200 --> 07:43.925
for crowd control, and this is just kind of a tradition, because they don't control any crowds.

07:44.005 --> 07:53.335
They're supposed to be there in case they're needed, but they stand along the sidelines, and they all wear sabers, and they wear campaign hats, and they're called the ODs, the officers of the day.

07:54.717 --> 08:06.169
So we're playing SMU, and the SMU football team scores, and the SMU Yale leaders run out on the field and lay down, and with their bodies, they're farming

08:06.672 --> 08:36.291
SMU you know they're jumping around rolling around farming that well one of the cadets gets carried away and runs out and tells them they're going to get off the field and they don't comply and he pulls his saber so he's threatening them with his saber and of course this the picture of this made national news well it was you know it was a terribly embarrassing incident for me and so I knew

08:36.558 --> 08:39.060
that I was really gonna hear about this.

08:40.582 --> 08:43.985
So I figured, well, I figured what my approach would be.

08:45.966 --> 08:52.012
And that was that I'm gonna immediately remove sabers from all ODs for a while.

08:53.113 --> 09:00.599
So I was invited to the President's home, Frank Vandiver, for an after game get together.

09:00.699 --> 09:06.244
So I went in, I walked in the front door of the President's home, and he's standing there waiting for me.

09:06.629 --> 09:07.971
that he is very unhappy.

09:08.011 --> 09:09.895
It's obvious that he is very unhappy.

09:10.796 --> 09:18.950
So he went over, I walked over to him and I said, I want to apologize for what happened down there.

09:18.990 --> 09:21.615
I'm going to assure you it will never happen again.

09:21.655 --> 09:24.941
And I'm taking the sabers away.

09:25.001 --> 09:29.228
First thing I'm going to do is take the sabers away from the ODs.

09:29.866 --> 09:33.012
And so that kind of calmed him down, and we talked about it and everything.

09:34.575 --> 09:43.853
So my plan was that if I take the sabers away, I can give them back because I knew the sabers were going.

09:44.794 --> 09:49.704
But if he took them away, I would have to go to him and ask that they come back.

09:50.165 --> 09:52.549
So I kind of preempted him.

09:53.677 --> 10:12.255
And so we went on that year and I had people write me letters that, you know, taking the sabers away from the commandant, I mean from the cadets, ODs was terrible and the SMU player should not have been on the field and this and that.

10:12.375 --> 10:14.417
And you know, it went on for a good while.

10:16.479 --> 10:22.705
So the following fall, I sent a memorandum over to

10:23.832 --> 10:39.146
to President Vanderveer, and I said, you know, this is the procedure for this year, that we are, in fact, going to allow the ODs to have their sabers.

10:39.206 --> 10:43.130
However, they will be briefed before each game by Colonel Johnson.

10:44.692 --> 10:50.397
Primarily, they're under no circumstance to take their saber from the Scalbert.

10:51.001 --> 10:55.728
And we went on with the different restrictions on them.

10:55.748 --> 10:57.430
It made it sound real tight.

10:58.592 --> 10:59.533
And I sent it over.

10:59.553 --> 11:04.861
You know, I said, you know, this is what I plan to do unless you have some objection.

11:04.881 --> 11:06.163
Well, I never heard back.

11:06.183 --> 11:07.424
And so I put them back in.

11:07.484 --> 11:11.690
And I know a reporter from the BAT came in because this is big news.

11:11.791 --> 11:13.493
The OD is going to get their sabers back.

11:13.553 --> 11:18.901
And the BAT sent a reporter over to see me.

11:19.361 --> 11:20.603
And I had about 100%

11:21.224 --> 11:25.208
record with the bat on being misquoted every time.

11:26.149 --> 11:31.455
So this guy came over and he said, well, I said, well, you know, it was never permanent.

11:31.535 --> 11:33.937
I said, that was a temporary thing.

11:35.199 --> 11:40.504
I said, you know, I removed them and I was planning to give them back, but I was going to wait a while.

11:40.845 --> 11:42.586
He said, well, why didn't you tell us that?

11:43.347 --> 11:45.910
I said, I'll tell you why I didn't tell you that.

11:45.990 --> 11:47.411
It's because you didn't ask me.

11:47.692 --> 11:48.953
If you'd have asked me, I'd have told you.

11:49.625 --> 11:51.347
I figured that was a pretty good lesson for me.

11:51.407 --> 11:53.249
Better learn how to ask questions.

11:53.649 --> 11:56.712
But anyway, we gave them back, and it's gone along now.

11:56.732 --> 12:00.436
I haven't had any more trouble.

12:00.837 --> 12:03.339
Any other incidents like that that you recall?

12:03.359 --> 12:13.350
Well, there was what I call the great carnation caper, and that was each year the Corps buys carnations for Mother's Day, red or white.

12:14.391 --> 12:19.176
And as it turns out, I get a call like the day before

12:19.713 --> 12:26.340
before Mother's Day from the Horticulture Club, and they want to know where to deliver the flowers.

12:26.380 --> 12:28.883
And I told them, well, that's handled by the Corps staff.

12:30.345 --> 12:32.287
I'll get in touch with them and have them give you a call.

12:32.327 --> 12:41.717
So I called over, and as it turns out, two people on the Corps staff have ordered carnations, like 2,000 carnations each.

12:41.977 --> 12:46.142
So we've got, we're over about 2,000 carnations.

12:46.882 --> 12:53.673
And so I told them, I said, look, you know, you guys are going to have to get your stuff together over there and you're going to have to operate as a staff.

12:53.833 --> 12:54.834
Now you've got a problem.

12:55.295 --> 12:58.740
You've got 4,000 carnations that you've got to pay for.

12:58.901 --> 13:03.107
So when you figure out how you're going to pay for them, come tell me.

13:03.288 --> 13:07.654
And then when you figure out how you're going to solve this problem, well, let me know.

13:07.694 --> 13:09.657
And they got it solved.

13:09.698 --> 13:10.779
They paid for it somehow.

13:10.799 --> 13:13.243
I can't remember how they paid for it, but that was one.

13:13.814 --> 13:35.282
one incident was you know no one was hurt but it was a good lesson for them and what i wanted to do in the corps was let them make mistakes and but let them learn from their mistakes you know don't crucify somebody because they did something they made a mistake doing something i you know i would hope they wouldn't do anything dumb but you know you get two thousand

13:35.718 --> 13:42.610
young people 18 to 20 years old together, and there's going to be a few dumb things that happen.

13:42.650 --> 13:50.683
One dumb thing was one of the upperclassmen around Christmas was approaching, and he told the freshman to go out.

13:50.723 --> 13:53.067
They wanted some Christmas trees out in front of the dorm.

13:53.828 --> 13:56.994
So the next morning, I hear these two big pine trees out there.

13:58.496 --> 14:00.780
Well, then I get a call from a prof.

14:00.997 --> 14:04.300
These pine trees came from in front of his place.

14:04.981 --> 14:09.365
He had planned them so many years ago and this and he was very upset.

14:10.186 --> 14:11.808
So I told him, well, we'll work something out.

14:11.828 --> 14:22.438
So what we did, we got a valuation on the, we got a value on the pine trees, which is I think about $400.

14:22.579 --> 14:28.084
And then the outfit had to come up with that much money and go out and

14:28.587 --> 14:33.898
replant his entrance to his place out in the country and it had been four hundred dollars.

14:33.938 --> 14:35.481
Had somebody cut them down?

14:36.163 --> 14:37.866
The cadets had gone out and cut them down.

14:37.926 --> 14:49.330
Yeah the freshman had gone out and cut them you know so they said go get Christmas tree and they went out and they got the two pine trees and then I got a call one night it was probably

14:50.255 --> 15:19.367
one or two o'clock in the morning, some professor, and oh, he was very upset, and he was really almost screaming at me, and as it turned out, he had heard some hollering out in his, he lived out in the country here, he had heard someone hollering in the night, and he went out there, and it was a cadet with all the underwear on him, it was a freezing night, was tied to this tree, so he got the guy and brought him in and draped a coat or blanket over him, and he called me to come after him.

15:19.752 --> 15:41.068
So the thing about it, he gave me directions and I drove around out in the country there for about an hour before I finally saw a place that had a light on and went down there and of course apologized to the guy and picked up this cadet who was, by that time, he was just about frozen and took him back to the dormitory.

15:42.365 --> 15:49.094
So, you know, that was, those are the things you can look back on and laugh, but at the time, it wasn't too funny.

15:49.975 --> 15:53.560
What about Bonfire from the Commandant's point of view during those five years?

15:53.680 --> 15:59.327
Okay, I tried to limit the Corps participation in Bonfire.

15:59.507 --> 16:06.717
In fact, after a year or two, I went to the student service staff and I said, the Corps is doing too much.

16:06.757 --> 16:09.300
We've got to get the civilian students involved.

16:09.702 --> 16:19.476
And the people in chartered civilian students need to get them better organized and get them to where they're building their fair share of the bonfire.

16:19.928 --> 16:29.098
Because if you depend on the Corps next year, you're probably not going to have a bonfire because I'm going to fix it where they're not going to participate and you're not going to have a bonfire.

16:29.118 --> 16:31.221
So that was the ultimatum I gave them.

16:31.641 --> 16:33.063
And it worked out.

16:33.083 --> 16:45.356
And they got, you know, they got red pots over in the civilian and they got brown pots and I don't know what kind of, what all pots they have, but they got organized and we got a lot more participation.

16:45.937 --> 16:48.720
I went out one night about, oh, it was,

16:49.088 --> 16:57.817
probably 11 o'clock at night and checking on there probably three or four hundred freshmen out there and they needed about 50.

16:58.478 --> 17:04.944
They were all out there just kind of standing around and then I found out that the next day was the big chemistry quiz.

17:05.405 --> 17:11.711
Well these people ought to be studying or sleeping rather than out here standing around watching someone build a bonfire.

17:12.412 --> 17:16.716
So I put a restriction on it where you had to have a card and the card had to say

17:17.168 --> 17:21.963
you had a grade point ratio of over 2 or 2.5 or something like that.

17:22.385 --> 17:24.491
Otherwise, you're not going to work on the bonfire.

17:24.572 --> 17:26.739
So I put in some restrictions like that.

17:27.521 --> 17:30.270
You know, sometimes those restrictions work, sometimes they don't.

17:30.290 --> 17:30.992
But anyway,

17:32.052 --> 17:40.464
The point is that I did put restrictions on people's participation in the bonfire and got the Corps to get a little better organized and have different units out there.

17:40.544 --> 17:42.447
Just don't say, everybody run out there.

17:42.687 --> 17:45.030
You know, we got to push so everybody goes out there.

17:45.491 --> 17:47.093
Don't go out there if you're not needed.

17:47.133 --> 17:49.096
And the bonfire was always?

17:49.557 --> 17:52.060
The bonfire at that time was on Duncan Field.

17:52.321 --> 17:56.687
And see, the Corps was right there by Duncan Field, so it was easy for them to walk over.

17:57.828 --> 18:00.372
And was it during your years that?

18:00.807 --> 18:04.623
and others put a limit on the dimensions?

18:04.663 --> 18:06.169
No, that was before.

18:06.189 --> 18:11.391
It had already... Yeah, but I lobbied for five years,

18:11.658 --> 18:14.584
get rid of that cake.

18:15.245 --> 18:16.267
I thought it looked terrible.

18:16.848 --> 18:22.178
To go back to the old teepee style and first of all, it doesn't take near as long to do.

18:22.378 --> 18:24.583
Second place, it's easier to do.

18:24.643 --> 18:30.414
And third place, it's a lot safer than that wedding cake.

18:31.095 --> 18:32.738
I always thought it was a monstrosity.

18:32.718 --> 18:41.829
A while ago, as we were talking about people, Ron Blatchley, what was his role in those years?

18:42.430 --> 18:52.603
Well, he was, first of all, he was the assistant to Charlie Powell and they were student affairs, I believe, student affairs.

18:52.763 --> 18:55.746
And he was the deputy director of student affairs.

18:56.427 --> 18:59.451
And then when Charlie Powell was moved out of the director's job,

19:00.241 --> 19:02.806
Then Blasley became the director of student affairs.

19:02.926 --> 19:10.701
I got along with Blasley real good, but we did, you know, have a few confrontations and everything, but we remained friends.

19:11.322 --> 19:12.845
But we went to the mat a few times.

19:13.166 --> 19:18.115
Now, was he still in that role when you retired as coming up?

19:19.478 --> 19:20.800
Yes.

19:20.820 --> 19:20.921
Okay.

19:20.941 --> 19:30.238
Because, see, they went to the Baptist Church in Bryan, and we thought that he and his wife had lost their mind when he gave up that good job and went to work for McDonald's.

19:30.258 --> 19:30.999
My goodness.

19:31.019 --> 19:34.045
Well, he just wanted to be a millionaire.

19:35.307 --> 19:40.034
Let's see, and Carolyn Adair, she had student activities.

19:40.054 --> 19:48.586
All right, but you didn't have any direct... Well, we were all on the same, on John's staff, and we went to staff meetings.

19:48.706 --> 19:50.188
When were those staff meetings?

19:50.268 --> 19:51.510
Every Wednesday morning.

19:51.530 --> 19:54.575
About how many people, 10, 8, 10?

19:56.077 --> 19:56.918
Probably 12.

19:57.899 --> 20:01.705
What were coldest, did John coldest have any pet peeves?

20:02.125 --> 20:04.048
What were the things that bothered him most?

20:04.889 --> 20:08.554
You know, I don't know that I recall any pet peeves.

20:10.057 --> 20:10.898
I can't think of any.

20:10.958 --> 20:12.160
Did you ever see him lose his coup?

20:13.181 --> 20:14.323
No, not actually.

20:15.946 --> 20:17.288
I don't remember ever.

20:18.970 --> 20:26.221
When Frank Vandiver became president, did anything change relative to the president's office at the Corps?

20:26.642 --> 20:28.264
No, he was supportive.

20:30.269 --> 20:31.971
See, I'm his first doctoral student.

20:32.231 --> 20:32.572
Yeah.

20:32.852 --> 20:36.317
No, he was supportive.

20:36.857 --> 20:38.079
He wasn't around much.

20:38.880 --> 20:43.706
If you wanted to see him, it was hard to see him because he wasn't here.

20:44.727 --> 20:50.074
Now, during your five years, the enrollment on the campus, the total enrollment continued to grow.

20:50.915 --> 20:54.219
The core enrollment tended to be comparatively constant.

20:55.882 --> 20:58.605
Did anybody ever try to...

20:59.007 --> 21:03.658
to put any pressure on you to make the core bigger or smaller?

21:04.620 --> 21:09.511
Most pressure was what I put on myself to make the core larger.

21:11.857 --> 21:13.641
We were getting

21:14.161 --> 21:20.168
We were getting, I don't used to know what percent of the incoming males.

21:21.469 --> 21:27.957
Incoming females, we got a very small percent, but we got something like 20% of the incoming males.

21:28.478 --> 21:36.186
I can't remember what it was, but we could usually figure on that each year, and that was, but we'd lose a lot, too.

21:37.488 --> 21:41.873
Now, normally in those five years, normally those that left the court

21:42.123 --> 21:45.972
at the end of the first semester or first year or when?

21:46.493 --> 21:50.542
Well, you had a big attrition the first few weeks.

21:50.562 --> 21:54.090
That was where your big attrition was.

21:54.593 --> 21:59.899
Then you had a few that would drop out at the end of the first semester, and usually those are ones that dropped out of school.

22:00.560 --> 22:05.926
And then you had a few more that drop out at the end of the first year, and it was usually for academics.

22:06.506 --> 22:11.552
But that early first few weeks, they just shifted from the Corps to civilian.

22:11.572 --> 22:12.213
Yeah, you had them.

22:12.733 --> 22:19.421
I had one guy that he hadn't been in the Corps three hours, and he came in and told me he wanted out.

22:19.982 --> 22:22.204
And, you know, I had another guy, I remember,

22:22.825 --> 22:30.714
We'd get their hair cut about Tuesday, and it was Monday night, and he said he was going to get out of the Corps, and I told him, you can't get out of the Corps until tomorrow afternoon.

22:30.794 --> 22:33.017
See, I was going to get that guy a haircut.

22:33.037 --> 22:43.549
I was determined because he really needed a haircut, so I figured, well, son, we'll get you a haircut anyway, and you at least have gotten that out of the Corps, so I made him stay until I got him a haircut.

22:43.729 --> 22:45.731
Where did they get a haircut?

22:45.851 --> 22:51.718
What we did, we lined up every barber in town, and we sent them over by unit,

22:51.935 --> 22:54.519
Oh, to the barber shops?

22:54.539 --> 22:56.162
To the Pacific barber shops, yeah.

22:56.182 --> 22:57.244
Oh, okay.

22:57.264 --> 23:03.995
So like this one at the South Gate would have four or five, and they would be scheduled, you know, timed in.

23:04.736 --> 23:11.828
What was the, at that time, what was the core practice regarding women and hair and hairdo?

23:12.409 --> 23:14.212
Well, you just had to have it off your shoulder.

23:14.973 --> 23:15.755
Okay.

23:15.775 --> 23:17.217
It wasn't very strict.

23:17.450 --> 23:24.979
And so there wasn't any problem with, as long as they kept their hair pulled up, they could have long hair.

23:25.559 --> 23:33.088
Were there any other appearance realities regarding women in the Corps that were troublesome?

23:33.448 --> 23:33.649
No.

23:35.471 --> 23:38.034
Tattoos, was that a problem with males?

23:39.475 --> 23:41.938
I don't know that I ever saw a cadet with a tattoo.

23:42.745 --> 23:44.727
I wonder today.

23:45.468 --> 23:47.450
I don't know.

23:49.172 --> 23:49.673
Let's see.

23:50.393 --> 23:56.940
As you saw it, what was the purpose of the Corps?

23:56.960 --> 24:02.406
Well, one thing, it was the keeper of tradition as far as the Corps is concerned.

24:02.426 --> 24:07.572
Of course, the purpose was, you know, to be

24:08.159 --> 24:25.124
somewhere where you could have the Army ROTC, I mean, all the ROTC cadets, you know, live and get a better field for military service and better training for military service by living, you know, under military discipline, 24 hours in a military environment.

24:26.386 --> 24:35.500
So that's, but to me, the purpose of the Corps is to maintain the traditions, because they are the, you know, they refer to themselves as the keepers of tradition.

24:36.172 --> 24:45.533
Were you surprised in comparing your Commandant years to your student years of what traditions had come and gone?

24:45.553 --> 24:46.394
Were there many?

24:46.415 --> 24:55.294
Well, the basic tradition, there are a lot of practices that come and go, but there are some basic traditions, you know, like Silver Taps.

24:55.730 --> 24:58.717
And, you know, march-ins at the football game.

24:58.817 --> 24:59.739
Those didn't change.

24:59.960 --> 25:05.894
And, you know, the basic silver taps, muster, things like that.

25:06.876 --> 25:08.520
Being friendly, speaking on campus.

25:08.540 --> 25:11.747
Of course, we just about lost that, you know.

25:12.183 --> 25:13.608
In fact, I shock a lot of people.

25:13.648 --> 25:17.560
I walk around the campus, and especially if they're a cadet, I'll say howdy right in their face.

25:18.122 --> 25:20.349
And it kind of startles them, you know.

25:20.370 --> 25:25.787
But basically, and you know, whipping out and meeting people.

25:26.037 --> 25:31.644
Firm hand grip, look at them in the eye, Aggie ring, there's a lot of good things.

25:32.765 --> 25:44.280
You know, all these traditions, the true traditions all started with the Corps, and now the Corps kind of feels like that they're here to maintain those traditions, and I believe they are, and I'm a great supporter of the Corps.

25:45.822 --> 25:52.230
And on all of your experiences, do you feel positive about

25:53.273 --> 26:01.482
the quality of the product from the Texas A&M Corps of Cadets compared to other military programs in the nation?

26:01.502 --> 26:08.450
Oh yeah, I think we turn out just as good of officers as anyone, and I've seen it over the years.

26:09.351 --> 26:17.279
I've seen some good ones, and I've seen some bad ones, and I've seen some good military academy graduates in all services.

26:17.300 --> 26:20.143
I've seen some that weren't so good.

26:20.723 --> 26:22.285
Other than the academies,

26:22.754 --> 26:30.306
What ROTC programs of an A&M in the nation do you hold in high regard?

26:30.547 --> 26:33.752
Well, the Citadel, VMI.

26:35.455 --> 26:43.648
I haven't known very many Norwich graduates, but North Georgia, I've seen some fine people out of North Georgia.

26:44.303 --> 26:48.308
And, of course, what we're talking about, we're talking about people from the south, essentially.

26:49.950 --> 26:55.277
So, North Georgia, I met a few from VMI.

26:55.297 --> 26:57.219
I mean, not VMI, but Virginia Tech.

26:59.201 --> 27:02.385
And, you know, I can only remember one that I remember.

27:02.506 --> 27:03.807
And, you know, he was a good officer.

27:04.208 --> 27:08.573
But I met some fine officers from VMI in the Citadel in North Georgia.

27:08.553 --> 27:19.447
If we had access to the Pentagon's records, do you have any idea about whether they would give high marks to any of the other ROTC programs in the nation?

27:20.449 --> 27:22.011
I wouldn't have any idea.

27:23.112 --> 27:26.617
I don't know how they would quantify it to begin with.

27:27.798 --> 27:32.164
In my Missouri years, I learned that ROTC was required.

27:32.549 --> 27:38.497
at the University of Missouri till about 1950 or so, and then they went optional.

27:39.218 --> 27:44.225
And it was no, no, it had no important role at all.

27:45.427 --> 27:52.397
During your years as commandant, were they still having the important core dances?

27:54.250 --> 27:56.493
Well, ring dance and boot dance.

27:56.513 --> 28:07.467
No, they had the boot dance and the ring dance, but nothing like we had, like we used to have the infantry ball and the artillery ball and things like that with the big... Those had ceased.

28:07.548 --> 28:08.329
Those had ceased.

28:08.369 --> 28:11.993
Now, they had a military ball with nothing like what we had.

28:12.013 --> 28:14.757
Where were they holding it while you were coming up?

28:15.108 --> 28:19.152
Like the old, the Ramada Inn over here.

28:19.172 --> 28:20.914
That was usually where they would have one.

28:22.356 --> 28:26.280
But they didn't have the... Was the Commandant invited as a special guest?

28:26.640 --> 28:27.742
Well, yes, he was invited.

28:28.683 --> 28:31.406
Then they had the combat ball.

28:31.446 --> 28:33.007
They would have that in Duncan Hall.

28:33.208 --> 28:35.610
You know, everybody wearing combat boots and so forth.

28:36.171 --> 28:37.212
Combat ball.

28:38.493 --> 28:40.215
Things like that I usually didn't go to.

28:40.936 --> 28:42.938
Now, in the social events,

28:43.407 --> 28:48.052
Did the co-eds in the Corps, did they participate in the social events also?

28:48.112 --> 28:48.373
Yes.

28:48.573 --> 28:52.037
They went to the dances and there were no incidents?

28:52.417 --> 28:55.320
No, not a social event that I know of.

28:56.962 --> 29:04.310
Well, did, as far as you were aware, did many male Corps members date female Corps members?

29:04.951 --> 29:05.792
There were some of that.

29:07.134 --> 29:11.018
Of course, there were some of them that were very attractive and there were others that

29:11.133 --> 29:16.350
weren't that attractive, so the ones that were, you know, attractive had dates.

29:16.370 --> 29:22.510
How often did the Commandant in your five years hear from the Aggie Mothers Clubs about anything?

29:23.587 --> 29:27.812
Well, I used to go around, you know, I made speeches at mother's clubs.

29:28.632 --> 29:31.996
But did they write your call you very often about?

29:32.016 --> 29:32.877
Not very much.

29:33.858 --> 29:35.099
You know, I'd hear from some of them.

29:35.160 --> 29:39.785
Some of them, you know, I'd met and we kind of got to be friends over time.

29:42.788 --> 29:46.692
But I never really had any complaints from the mother's club.

29:47.347 --> 29:54.677
Right, and back to your perception of being the Commandant on the Corps.

29:59.543 --> 30:03.428
You were trying to make the Corps a little larger and stronger.

30:04.890 --> 30:13.101
What were your guidelines, your basic philosophy about what you wanted the Corps to be?

30:14.228 --> 30:21.995
Well, I wanted to be a place where a person could go in and learn how to follow and then learn how to lead.

30:22.055 --> 30:35.708
And in order to learn how to lead, there had to be some flexibility on making mistakes, that you didn't crucify someone for making a mistake, but you didn't want them to make dumb mistakes.

30:35.728 --> 30:41.974
You know, you wanted them to use a little common sense on anything they did.

30:43.557 --> 30:46.981
I don't know, that's kind of a difficult question.

30:48.382 --> 31:10.105
But I, you know, I wanted the Corps to look good, and I wanted them to have discipline, and especially when they were in public, I wanted them to represent the Corps honorably and make the university proud of the cadets.

31:13.072 --> 31:19.277
Were there people that you might have sent a student to get special advice?

31:19.318 --> 31:21.780
Were there some advisors, counselors?

31:21.900 --> 31:33.050
Well, we had each company or flight or squadron, that is, each unit in the Corps had a military officer that was their advisor.

31:34.731 --> 31:38.234
And we, you know, encouraged that.

31:38.294 --> 31:39.896
Some did a good job.

31:39.956 --> 31:42.538
Others didn't pay too much attention.

31:43.227 --> 31:48.058
Now the Army, they were pretty conscientious because I was their raider.

31:48.178 --> 31:50.683
See, I raided them and gave them their efficiency report.

31:50.784 --> 32:00.966
So they were a little more conscientious than some of the other people over there that didn't take a whole lot of interest in their cadet units.
