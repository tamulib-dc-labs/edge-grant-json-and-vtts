00:03.035 --> 00:13.671
As we begin this second tape, let's go back to the Rudder years and some of those important changes.

00:15.054 --> 00:24.108
How did the coming of women affect your department's courses and the way you all taught them and so forth?

00:24.128 --> 00:28.975
Well, our teacher education courses or professional courses, it didn't really affect those.

00:29.950 --> 00:38.361
because there wasn't any content in there that would be objectable in a mixed class.

00:39.543 --> 00:44.489
But of course, in our activity program, we didn't have dressing facilities for women.

00:45.571 --> 00:50.237
So we used the visiting team's dressing room.

00:51.483 --> 00:54.268
for women to take a shower and so forth.

00:54.889 --> 00:59.257
And then we used a storage place across the hall where they'd keep their things.

01:01.181 --> 01:04.286
So when the basketball team come in, the lockers would be empty.

01:05.428 --> 01:06.350
And that worked pretty good.

01:07.673 --> 01:09.576
And of course, then we

01:10.973 --> 01:14.302
had to build showers and so forth for women.

01:15.165 --> 01:21.382
Now, did you have male and female students in the same class?

01:21.763 --> 01:22.485
In the same classes?

01:22.505 --> 01:22.745
Yes.

01:23.788 --> 01:24.951
Activity classes also?

01:24.972 --> 01:25.894
Activity classes.

01:26.701 --> 01:40.356
And did the women, in terms of taking advanced courses and majors, did you all see an influx of them pretty quickly?

01:41.177 --> 01:41.697
Yes, we did.

01:42.838 --> 01:49.806
And then, of course, we divided the department because then they had separate certification in health education, so we put that in a separate category.

01:50.427 --> 01:51.608
And then a lot of women in that.

01:51.748 --> 01:56.073
And from that we had developed in the community health program.

01:56.913 --> 01:59.416
And we had a lot of, still have a lot of majors in that program.

02:00.397 --> 02:03.380
And so we had a lot of women.

02:03.420 --> 02:07.364
We have more women in the department now, I think, majoring than we probably have men.

02:07.384 --> 02:08.505
All right.

02:08.565 --> 02:15.692
So you, and you took over as department head about the time that women began to be admitted fully.

02:16.246 --> 02:17.450
without restriction.

02:19.276 --> 02:19.597
Yes.

02:19.617 --> 02:25.537
Did the total number of majors begin to increase rapidly?

02:25.818 --> 02:26.340
Yes.

02:27.535 --> 02:29.837
Of course, the university was rapidly increasing.

02:29.877 --> 02:30.118
Right.

02:30.498 --> 02:36.865
As I think I mentioned, we went from, what, 11,000 to 31,000 while I was department head.

02:36.905 --> 02:40.188
So the whole student body was increasing so fast.

02:41.549 --> 02:55.804
Do you remember yourself hearing any of the news when Mr. Rutter was sick in the early 1970, his illness and his death?

02:55.784 --> 02:58.629
Do you remember hearing any sudden report of that?

03:01.894 --> 03:02.875
I don't, myself.

03:02.895 --> 03:03.196
I don't.

03:04.398 --> 03:08.524
I remember that, yes, he'd had a kidney and a heart problem, and he was in the hospital.

03:08.745 --> 03:09.426
Yes.

03:09.446 --> 03:11.729
But I don't remember being stunned.

03:11.749 --> 03:12.350
Oh, my.

03:13.252 --> 03:15.576
It didn't seem that sudden.

03:16.677 --> 03:21.505
But I sure wasn't aware that he was sickly.

03:21.957 --> 03:26.142
And if I'm not mistaken, he died one month before his 60th birthday.

03:26.663 --> 03:27.765
I think that's about right.

03:28.666 --> 03:30.869
Most people were not aware of that.

03:31.950 --> 03:32.271
Let's see.

03:32.311 --> 03:33.953
Let's jump back to a national event.

03:34.393 --> 03:34.694
Okay.

03:34.854 --> 03:40.822
Where were you and what was your reaction when you heard the news of the Kennedy assassination?

03:41.683 --> 03:42.884
I was down at the department.

03:44.547 --> 03:47.931
And we had a radio in the...

03:48.957 --> 03:55.945
kind of back in one section of the office, and they heard it on the radio.

03:55.965 --> 04:00.891
Of course, and everybody, you know, gathered around the radio.

04:01.492 --> 04:03.334
But I was down at the department.

04:05.076 --> 04:18.171
I was teaching a 12-to-1 class, and I was going to hurry over with Garland Bayless to eat lunch at the MSC, and we were going to try to beat the students.

04:18.387 --> 04:25.235
And I went into his office and he was listening to the radio and I couldn't figure out why he was listening to the radio when there was something else.

04:25.736 --> 04:32.444
And then he grabbed me and I heard Walter Cronkite say, I've just been handed a bulletin, President Kennedy is dead.

04:33.225 --> 04:37.350
And I remember how that kind of stunned all of us.

04:39.052 --> 04:45.981
Back to A&M events, do you remember any of your first impressions of Jack Williams?

04:48.222 --> 04:48.622
Yes.

04:53.066 --> 04:58.051
My first contact with Jack Williams was not real present.

04:58.531 --> 05:00.032
I don't remember what it was, but it wasn't.

05:01.594 --> 05:12.864
I know the one thing that, see, in the department, we had to have the outdoor pool and the indoor pool had to be self-supporting.

05:14.826 --> 05:16.407
When they had built the outdoor pool,

05:18.665 --> 05:26.557
Art Adamson was Mr. Swim, and he didn't want an outdoor pool, so he wouldn't have anything to do with it.

05:27.258 --> 05:40.257
They went ahead and built it anyway, and the contractor was an A&M graduate, or the architect was, but he had never built a pool before, and it was one big mess.

05:40.277 --> 05:47.288
The first thing, you know, Art didn't have anything to do with it, and nobody from our department had anything to do with building the first pool.

05:49.208 --> 05:54.133
And as soon as they filled it full of water, the water turned milky colored.

05:54.153 --> 05:57.116
They had painted it with a paint that you didn't use in a pool.

05:58.537 --> 06:01.020
And they had a Dalmatious Earth filter.

06:01.961 --> 06:06.025
And the filter, that spurted stuff out into the pool.

06:06.866 --> 06:12.051
They had to empty the pool, scrape all the paint off, and do it right.

06:13.112 --> 06:13.993
And the diving board.

06:14.434 --> 06:18.878
We had a diving board, we had a three-meter board, and a ten-meter platform.

06:19.499 --> 06:23.124
And they were built on a pole-like thing.

06:23.144 --> 06:28.613
And you get on a 10-meter deal, and you can swing that thing back and forth three feet.

06:29.574 --> 06:31.036
You can just sway it back and forth.

06:31.677 --> 06:32.979
Well, you couldn't dive off that.

06:33.941 --> 06:35.142
You know, you get somebody killed.

06:35.803 --> 06:37.967
And you crawled up through a little tube to get to it.

06:39.669 --> 06:48.983
And we had to, I was trying to save money to take those things down, get a new filter system in, because I had to pay for it out of operating funds.

06:49.553 --> 06:52.776
And I took a vacation to Canada.

06:55.379 --> 06:58.242
Our son graduated from A&M.

06:59.283 --> 07:01.045
And we took the family up there at the Lake of the Woods.

07:04.368 --> 07:09.353
And while I was there, I got a message that Mr. Mamaliga had called.

07:12.116 --> 07:15.999
And Jack Williams had been driving down the street.

07:16.760 --> 07:19.543
His wife had said, wouldn't that look nice to have some

07:20.367 --> 07:21.409
pool furniture out there.

07:23.053 --> 07:26.901
So they took money out of that account and bought pool side of furniture.

07:27.822 --> 07:36.300
And I was saying before, and it didn't last a month, you know, they bought country club furniture for Aggie pool.

07:37.006 --> 07:38.528
And so we didn't start off very well.

07:40.430 --> 07:49.900
You know, my impression wasn't, but I think he did a good job at the university, but I was not, he was not one of my favorite people.

07:50.180 --> 07:51.161
Oh, I see, I see.

07:51.862 --> 08:02.053
Any other, as you look back during your days here, other key administrators that we haven't mentioned, and what role did they play?

08:03.475 --> 08:05.477
Deans, vice presidents,

08:07.043 --> 08:07.644
Presidents?

08:12.589 --> 08:15.412
Well, we mentioned T.O.

08:15.612 --> 08:18.315
Walton, of course, was president for a long, long time.

08:19.516 --> 08:25.702
And then we had Williams and Bolton and so forth in there.

08:25.722 --> 08:28.225
I can't remember much of what Morgan did.

08:28.265 --> 08:33.490
Harrington had a positive impact on him, I think.

08:34.904 --> 08:39.472
I can't remember a specific thing, but I think overall my impression was that he did a good job.

08:41.195 --> 08:55.259
And my impression of Miller, until he made that goof on the, you know, didn't shake hands with the girl, and I could see why they would replace him.

08:56.501 --> 08:57.823
I think he was doing a good job.

08:59.272 --> 09:01.520
And I think most of them have done pretty well.

09:02.002 --> 09:07.462
Did you have any, you didn't have any formal interaction with board members, did you?

09:08.626 --> 09:08.927
No.

09:10.561 --> 09:11.982
Well, with Peoples, I had some.

09:12.263 --> 09:16.867
I got to know him.

09:16.887 --> 09:18.048
And I got to know him through Penny.

09:18.669 --> 09:19.089
Oh, okay.

09:19.550 --> 09:21.552
Share any recollection you have?

09:21.872 --> 09:28.178
It was just, you know, just casual meetings and so forth, but not any reaction.

09:28.839 --> 09:38.408
If there were, if we could bring back some faculty members from other departments, are there any that you'd like to be able to thank?

09:39.147 --> 09:42.433
for their role in A&M's progress?

09:45.218 --> 09:46.661
Well, I'd like to thank Walter Warble.

09:47.703 --> 09:48.304
Is that what you mean?

09:48.464 --> 09:48.725
Yes.

09:50.188 --> 09:50.969
I'd like to thank him.

09:51.250 --> 09:51.771
What did he?

09:52.652 --> 09:53.494
He was psychology.

09:53.614 --> 09:54.856
Oh, yes, but why?

09:55.738 --> 09:59.485
Oh, just for the general things that he, the authority he contributed.

10:00.072 --> 10:01.594
Did he have a nickname?

10:01.714 --> 10:02.595
I don't remember one for him.

10:02.615 --> 10:03.596
I don't remember one for him.

10:03.756 --> 10:04.416
I don't.

10:04.436 --> 10:07.820
He had to because he was around too long and had too many classes.

10:08.180 --> 10:09.341
I don't remember what it was.

10:09.361 --> 10:11.183
I guess I had a nickname too, but I don't remember it.

10:11.283 --> 10:11.583
I didn't.

10:11.824 --> 10:12.905
I've not heard one for you.

10:15.768 --> 10:16.268
Let's see.

10:20.652 --> 10:21.313
I'm sure there are.

10:21.513 --> 10:24.857
English, math, chemistry.

10:25.517 --> 10:26.218
And biology.

10:27.519 --> 10:28.240
Dr. Gravett.

10:31.038 --> 10:41.934
In chemistry, I can't think of one in chemistry, but Dr. Gravett, and there's another person in biology that I can't recall.

10:41.975 --> 10:47.142
Now, wasn't Dr. Gravett a key advisor also to students?

10:47.162 --> 10:49.145
In medicine, who were going to be medical.

10:49.185 --> 10:50.407
That's what I thought.

10:50.648 --> 10:53.131
Doctors.

10:56.116 --> 10:56.877
And Dr. Potter.

10:59.978 --> 11:03.843
Now, he taught... Biology.

11:03.863 --> 11:05.224
Biology, yes, yes.

11:06.286 --> 11:15.557
What about, are there any former students that have a special place in your recollections?

11:16.618 --> 11:18.961
Yes, there are several.

11:20.043 --> 11:22.045
Go ahead and tell about them.

11:22.225 --> 11:26.931
Well, one was a football player.

11:28.767 --> 11:38.117
Came to A&M as a freshman, and at that time, freshmen were not eligible to play on the varsity, had a freshman team.

11:39.979 --> 11:49.350
He came to me about the third or fourth week of school and says, Dr. Landis, he says, my English teacher was right.

11:49.790 --> 11:52.733
I can't pass A&M.

11:52.753 --> 11:54.235
He says, I'm leaving, going home.

11:55.143 --> 12:02.370
And he says, she told me all through when I was talking about A&M, she says, you can't pass at A&M.

12:03.731 --> 12:04.552
And I think she's right.

12:05.613 --> 12:12.679
And I says, called her my name, I said, now you can pass courses at A&M, and you're going to pass courses at A&M.

12:13.380 --> 12:20.927
We're going to set a time, and every, on this date, at this time, every week, you're going to bring me in what you've done the week before.

12:21.367 --> 12:22.028
We did that.

12:22.649 --> 12:24.372
He went on, he got a PhD.

12:25.956 --> 12:27.038
How good, how good.

12:28.080 --> 12:29.322
Would you like to share his name?

12:30.144 --> 12:30.825
He's deceased.

12:31.086 --> 12:31.206
Oh.

12:32.649 --> 12:40.384
And he was a, he would become a multimillionaire over in, I'll give you his name, he would become multimillionaire over in East Texas.

12:40.404 --> 12:43.290
And they would send out gifts to,

12:44.502 --> 12:47.726
to their customers, you know, to the better customer.

12:47.746 --> 12:52.512
And he would give me one every year, but he would, he and his wife would drive over here.

12:52.833 --> 12:53.233
Oh, my.

12:53.253 --> 12:54.836
Over a 200 mile round trip.

12:54.856 --> 12:55.196
Oh, my.

12:55.216 --> 12:56.558
To give it to me in person.

12:56.578 --> 12:57.299
Oh, that's special.

12:57.639 --> 12:59.061
His name was Billy Tidballa.

12:59.702 --> 13:01.584
Oh, Billy, yes, yes.

13:03.026 --> 13:08.974
Now, during your era, the athletes had a wide variety of majors.

13:09.528 --> 13:09.988
Yes.

13:10.008 --> 13:13.091
Many people think that all athletes major in physical education.

13:13.111 --> 13:14.813
They still have a wide variety of majors.

13:14.833 --> 13:16.835
Yes, yes.

13:16.855 --> 13:26.864
Were there, as far as you know, were there certain courses that athletes and other students thought were really, really tough courses?

13:28.665 --> 13:33.029
Were there some courses that supposedly were the big stumbling blocks?

13:35.131 --> 13:38.574
Well, I had a course in test and measurements that they thought was pretty tough.

13:39.175 --> 13:39.535
Okay.

13:41.675 --> 13:45.059
And you know, we got a freedom calculator.

13:46.481 --> 13:47.562
And we sit there and marveled.

13:48.223 --> 13:50.366
That thing would spin and what it would do.

13:50.666 --> 13:53.409
Five things at one time.

13:56.713 --> 13:59.337
And I think the progress has been made, you know.

14:00.478 --> 14:01.059
Let's see.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.543
Let's jump to the Bear Bryant days.

14:05.232 --> 14:08.115
because surely you became acquainted with him.

14:08.155 --> 14:10.477
Do you remember your first acquaintance with him?

14:11.078 --> 14:19.026
My first time to meet him was we had Carl Tischler and Bryant, and so I just had coffee over at the MSC.

14:19.887 --> 14:21.388
We sat down at the table and we had coffee together.

14:22.710 --> 14:24.672
His relationship, our relationship was very good.

14:25.673 --> 14:29.957
Now, you know, when he came, he had more power than the president before.

14:31.318 --> 14:34.041
He could have snapped his fingers and the president would have been gone.

14:34.493 --> 14:40.323
But if he wanted to use a facility of ours, he would send somebody over and say, may we use it?

14:41.746 --> 14:44.130
Now, for example, we had the main basketball court.

14:44.150 --> 14:45.673
That was our part.

14:45.693 --> 14:50.441
And if it was raining or something, he wanted to work indoors, he would send over and ask if he could use it.

14:51.884 --> 14:56.111
But he would always do that.

14:56.432 --> 14:57.193
He never failed.

14:58.085 --> 15:04.794
What about his attitude about the class attendance and grades and so forth?

15:04.814 --> 15:05.014
Yes.

15:05.454 --> 15:06.596
I never had him ask me.

15:07.016 --> 15:11.562
I've only had one coach, and that was not in football, to ask me to change the grade of a student.

15:12.003 --> 15:12.443
Just one.

15:14.927 --> 15:19.933
In my years, I never had any, any... That's the only time I've been asked.

15:20.474 --> 15:27.703
Now, some of my colleagues in history, because Bryant predates, he was gone before I got here, said that Jerry Claiborne,

15:28.527 --> 15:37.816
would come over to chat with them about how certain students were doing so that he could do some encouraging of the students.

15:37.836 --> 15:51.089
And they said that they noticed that quite often during the conversation, Coach Claiborne would pull out his watch with his Phi Beta Kappa key hanging onto it and would ask them a question and then put it back in.

15:52.250 --> 15:52.610
Oh, is that right?

15:52.630 --> 15:58.416
And they thought that it was not by accident that he wanted them to know that he was a Phi Beta Kappa member.

15:58.784 --> 16:03.571
Well now, we did have this situation.

16:04.613 --> 16:17.653
It just relates to our, we had a freshman student who was supposed to be a good quarterback.

16:20.603 --> 16:35.004
His first semester grades was F, F, F, A, F, F, F. And the A was in a junior level course over in a different college from ours entirely.

16:35.245 --> 16:35.966
Oh, my goodness.

16:36.406 --> 16:40.212
And I don't think he could even spell the name of the course.

16:40.232 --> 16:45.700
But he did get an A. But this guy was a real gung-ho supporter of athletics and everything.

16:46.203 --> 16:49.148
You'd know if I called his name, but I won't do it.

16:51.391 --> 16:51.792
Let's see.

16:51.972 --> 16:55.217
You started officiating college football games when?

16:56.079 --> 16:56.419
In 1948.

16:56.439 --> 16:57.641
48.

17:00.586 --> 17:02.910
And at what level?

17:03.451 --> 17:06.135
Headlinesman.

17:06.115 --> 17:09.078
Did you start doing Southwest Conference in 48?

17:09.199 --> 17:14.745
Oh, in college games I started before then, like schools like Sam Houston and so forth, yes.

17:14.765 --> 17:15.145
Really?

17:15.566 --> 17:17.248
But you started doing Southwest Conference in 48?

17:17.268 --> 17:18.309
Southwest Conference in 48.

17:18.709 --> 17:20.652
So you did that from 48 till when?

17:21.473 --> 17:23.595
And my last game was the Cotton Bowl of 1972.

17:23.615 --> 17:23.935
72.

17:23.955 --> 17:30.503
72, yeah, that's right.

17:31.107 --> 17:32.849
And you started out as a Headlinesman.

17:33.209 --> 17:34.211
Started out as a Headlinesman.

17:34.711 --> 17:37.835
And I have always quoted you many, many times.

17:38.476 --> 17:43.201
I asked you many, many years ago, what was the secret to good officiating?

17:43.281 --> 17:49.348
And my memory has you saying, call them fast and walk away tough.

17:49.589 --> 17:50.990
Is that anywhere close to correct?

17:51.070 --> 17:51.831
I think that's right.

17:53.093 --> 17:59.460
Share some memories of officiating, some games and incidents.

18:00.740 --> 18:06.669
Well, I was very fortunate.

18:07.150 --> 18:09.132
I got to, see, then I changed to referee.

18:09.974 --> 18:16.604
I was in a game at SMU, SMU and Illinois, and the referee got sick.

18:17.184 --> 18:18.947
So they moved me to referee for that game.

18:19.969 --> 18:25.617
And then I refereed all the games after that.

18:26.609 --> 18:29.875
I never had really had any problems with a coach.

18:30.335 --> 18:40.393
I did in the cotton ball game one time with a trainer or equipment man.

18:40.833 --> 18:42.376
I was a headlinesman then.

18:42.396 --> 18:43.037
That was in 65.

18:44.299 --> 18:48.246
And that was the Nebraska-Arkansas game, most colorful game I've ever seen.

18:48.647 --> 18:51.672
Beautiful day, everybody red and white, everybody turned out.

18:52.040 --> 18:55.964
And when I'd run by him, he would just let me have it.

18:55.984 --> 19:02.049
And I stopped and I said, Coach, you get him over on the bench and keep him there or it's going to cost you 15 yards.

19:03.310 --> 19:04.731
And boy, he was on the bench after that.

19:05.452 --> 19:09.195
And so then I had a game, a high school game.

19:09.235 --> 19:10.797
I was working a playoff game.

19:10.817 --> 19:11.718
Odessa and somebody.

19:12.218 --> 19:17.423
And the coach from the visiting school had a real bad reputation.

19:18.083 --> 19:20.005
And at halftime, he come out and grabbed my arm.

19:21.419 --> 19:23.141
And I told him, I said, let go of that arm.

19:24.062 --> 19:25.043
He was asking me something.

19:25.063 --> 19:26.044
I said, let go of that arm.

19:26.505 --> 19:28.828
If I have to tell you again, it's going to cost you 15 yards.

19:29.549 --> 19:30.309
He turned loose of it.

19:30.910 --> 19:31.731
And you know that?

19:31.751 --> 19:35.275
He had me and he worked his games a lot of times.

19:35.295 --> 19:38.579
And then I had that in a college game over at Sam Houston.

19:38.819 --> 19:40.261
But I stuck that guy 15 yards.

19:40.281 --> 19:40.982
He didn't turn loose.

19:42.263 --> 19:45.267
But I never really had any problems.

19:45.500 --> 19:50.447
All right, what are some joyful moments that you remember from officiating?

19:51.549 --> 19:56.596
Well, I remember it was the people you work with, and the games were pleasant to work.

19:58.359 --> 20:00.221
I will tell you, I got applauded one time.

20:03.105 --> 20:04.808
I was working a homecoming game.

20:05.269 --> 20:09.735
Penn State was playing TCU, and it was in the fourth quarter.

20:10.424 --> 20:15.132
The score was about 60-0 or 60-7 in favor of Penn State.

20:15.152 --> 20:15.813
I was a referee.

20:16.454 --> 20:22.945
And I made the ball ready for play, and I walked back toward the huddle, and I saw this little chipmunk sitting right up on the line of scrimmage.

20:22.965 --> 20:24.067
So I stopped the game.

20:24.087 --> 20:26.391
Well, the first thing I heard, I heard the kids squealing.

20:26.431 --> 20:27.613
I heard the kids squealing.

20:27.693 --> 20:29.276
That's not the usual noise.

20:29.296 --> 20:31.339
I heard the kids squealing.

20:31.359 --> 20:32.301
I said, there's something wrong.

20:32.521 --> 20:34.204
So I looked around, and I saw the little chipmunk.

20:34.825 --> 20:35.886
And so I stopped the game.

20:36.507 --> 20:37.488
We got him off the field.

20:40.652 --> 20:41.994
So that's the time I got applauded.

20:42.394 --> 20:42.734
Let's see.

20:42.754 --> 20:45.478
Did you ever work any games with Doak Walker?

20:46.739 --> 20:47.901
Yes, when he played.

20:49.863 --> 20:52.166
And Bobby Lane.

20:52.326 --> 20:52.987
Bobby Lane.

20:53.007 --> 20:54.408
Yeah.

20:54.428 --> 20:54.989
My, my.

20:55.750 --> 21:02.638
Who were, as you look back, who were the coaches that you most respected based on

21:03.108 --> 21:04.330
what you saw and heard of.

21:04.350 --> 21:06.094
I'd have to put Darryl Royal at number one.

21:07.136 --> 21:07.396
Why?

21:07.877 --> 21:09.340
I'm not disagreeing with that.

21:09.360 --> 21:10.863
Because he was always a gentleman.

21:12.266 --> 21:15.352
And his teams were so well disciplined.

21:16.634 --> 21:17.817
They didn't have many fouls.

21:18.257 --> 21:20.702
They scrimmaged with officials.

21:20.722 --> 21:25.251
And so they called the fouls, and I made a mistake in one of his games.

21:26.210 --> 21:27.932
It cost him a touchdown.

21:28.894 --> 21:30.596
And the next game I had him in the next week.

21:31.738 --> 21:37.266
And he says, Carl, he says, and in the meantime, I had been sent three copies of the film.

21:38.047 --> 21:43.415
And I called a man in motion, but he really went laterally, which was legal.

21:44.176 --> 21:48.522
But I thought he went, and I called him in motion and called the touchdown back.

21:49.615 --> 21:52.600
And he said, Carl, he says, I think you missed one in the last game.

21:52.680 --> 21:56.247
I think the man started, you know, called him by name, said, was a letter motion.

21:56.267 --> 21:57.990
I said, Coach, you're exactly right.

21:58.010 --> 22:00.134
I looked at the film, and you're exactly right.

22:00.154 --> 22:00.514
I missed it.

22:00.835 --> 22:01.716
But that's all was said.

22:03.820 --> 22:05.924
All right, others than Coach Royal.

22:06.264 --> 22:13.497
And... What about Mr. Neely?

22:14.894 --> 22:18.178
Mr. Yes, I never had any problems.

22:18.258 --> 22:20.100
I really never had much contact with Mr. Neely.

22:20.120 --> 22:20.421
Oh, yeah.

22:21.522 --> 22:22.403
And who?

22:22.423 --> 22:23.624
No, I was just wondering about.

22:23.745 --> 22:24.966
Oh, Arkansas' coach.

22:25.226 --> 22:25.707
Broyles?

22:25.967 --> 22:26.628
Broyles, yeah.

22:26.648 --> 22:27.709
He was always very nice.

22:28.751 --> 22:34.157
And... Matty Bell.

22:34.557 --> 22:35.058
Matty Bell.

22:35.238 --> 22:36.580
Dutch Meyer.

22:36.600 --> 22:36.880
Yes.

22:37.621 --> 22:40.885
I worked games with, they played, but I never had much contact with them.

22:41.152 --> 23:02.721
Now, you could not work a game with A&M, but could work any other Southwest Conference team game, and then inter-conference games, non-conference games, again, not A&M, but any other school in the conference.

23:03.258 --> 23:13.794
They didn't send the referees as much, and see, most of my time I was a referee, and they don't send the referees as much as they do the field judges and the umpires.

23:13.814 --> 23:16.679
They kind of keep the referees home, but I've been, you know, different places.

23:17.280 --> 23:25.813
All right, and when you were doing that, were you doing it almost every, a game every week?

23:26.594 --> 23:28.337
Pretty close to it.

23:28.688 --> 23:30.149
eight or seven, eight or nine a year.

23:30.690 --> 23:35.034
All right, back in our old schedule when we had Saturday classes here.

23:35.354 --> 23:35.915
Yes.

23:35.935 --> 23:41.780
How did you work that in with your officiating?

23:41.800 --> 23:49.568
I don't remember that we had Saturday classes when I became a conference official.

23:49.588 --> 23:51.229
Okay, all right.

23:51.249 --> 23:58.476
Now, did you normally get to the location of the conference game on Friday afternoon?

23:59.114 --> 23:59.615
Yes.

23:59.635 --> 24:00.838
You were there to spend the night.

24:01.039 --> 24:01.921
Yes.

24:01.941 --> 24:03.425
And if possible, I took my wife with me.

24:04.166 --> 24:11.284
Because I assume that in many cases you went by automobile before airplanes.

24:11.618 --> 24:13.000
Yes, or train.

24:13.702 --> 24:14.403
Oh, I forgot.

24:14.423 --> 24:15.184
Sure, sure.

24:16.406 --> 24:21.795
I went to Little Rock to work a game in Arkansas and somebody in Little Rock.

24:21.815 --> 24:22.316
I took a train.

24:22.617 --> 24:25.722
You and Barney Welch worked that game of the century, didn't you?

24:25.842 --> 24:27.144
Yes.

24:27.705 --> 24:29.408
Share any memories about that one.

24:30.215 --> 24:41.511
Well, I think the, the thing I think that caught my attention mostly was I was so surprised when Arkansas passed and it was intercepted.

24:41.991 --> 24:46.598
That really caught me of a surprise because I thought, sure, I had it worked out.

24:46.638 --> 24:49.602
He was going to run a play, kick a field goal.

24:50.623 --> 24:51.244
That was going to be it.

24:52.886 --> 24:54.068
But the pass was intercepted.

24:54.729 --> 24:57.893
And then, of course, there was that pass on the sideline that Shorty Lawson called.

24:58.936 --> 25:07.907
And when I got back to the airport in Dallas, somebody said to me, he says, Carl, I said, there sure was a lot of controversy on that call.

25:09.189 --> 25:12.913
And I didn't know anything about it, of course, from the day of the game.

25:14.455 --> 25:20.222
But Cliff Spiegel was the Commissioner of Officials.

25:20.242 --> 25:22.345
And he sent me three films.

25:23.388 --> 25:26.311
On all of them, it showed that the ball was clearly in the receiver's hand.

25:26.812 --> 25:31.057
One of them, it showed the receiver's toe, and his toe was bent.

25:31.077 --> 25:35.162
So his toe was in contact with the grip, the ball was in the receiver's hands, the pass was complete.

25:35.562 --> 25:38.626
So Shorty called it, correct, and it was a hundredth of a second.

25:49.458 --> 25:52.922
So... Did Coach Broyles...

25:53.257 --> 25:55.059
He didn't complain, did he?

25:55.219 --> 25:55.400
No.

25:55.980 --> 25:56.281
Oh, yeah.

25:56.301 --> 25:57.622
There's another thing.

25:57.722 --> 26:01.387
In a Rice-Baylor game, it was the last game of the season.

26:01.988 --> 26:04.170
Rice and Baylor were playing for last place.

26:04.190 --> 26:12.080
And it was a miserable day, cold and raining, and the players would say, Mr. Referee, don't stop the clock.

26:13.141 --> 26:14.963
Don't stop the clock.

26:15.504 --> 26:19.028
And so...

26:22.433 --> 26:31.006
Do you remember any game that was almost the extreme of your experience in score?

26:32.769 --> 26:34.411
You mentioned one that was 60-something.

26:34.632 --> 26:36.374
Do you remember any that was worse than that?

26:36.494 --> 26:41.442
I think the final score, that was 70-something to 14 or something like that.

26:41.462 --> 26:42.584
So that's about as bad?

26:42.664 --> 26:43.926
That's about as bad as I've had.

26:45.268 --> 26:50.095
And what were some that you remember that are decided at the last instant?

26:53.990 --> 26:57.696
You must remember a few that last play.

26:59.820 --> 27:07.512
Yeah, really, as an official, I forgot the plays almost after the next play, I didn't try to remember the last play.

27:09.195 --> 27:16.207
And another thing I didn't do, we'd have a meeting of the conference officials and coaches before the season started.

27:16.648 --> 27:17.770
Then they'd go out and play golf.

27:18.431 --> 27:19.272
I didn't do that.

27:19.943 --> 27:26.490
I didn't want to be your old buddies and so forth riding on the same car with you, and next week stick your, you know, 15 yards.

27:26.850 --> 27:27.671
Yeah, yeah.

27:27.691 --> 27:31.235
Because, you know, then you see, yeah, here, Carl, while we were on a golf course together.

27:31.996 --> 27:32.596
I didn't want that.

27:33.978 --> 27:36.520
Your mic just fell out of its holder.

27:36.981 --> 27:41.185
I think it'll still pick up, but let's see.

27:41.225 --> 27:45.630
Now let's bounce back to...

27:45.610 --> 28:05.475
living here near the campus the folks who lived on the campus faculty members they begin up that that little holder fell there the folks that lived on the campus began to move off the campus in the 50s

28:05.455 --> 28:10.209
There were some that started moving off before we got here.

28:10.410 --> 28:10.650
Right.

28:11.152 --> 28:14.261
Now, did most of the faculty that moved off campus live here?

28:14.802 --> 28:15.926
Y'all called it Southside?

28:16.287 --> 28:16.748
Yes.

28:17.403 --> 28:20.227
Most of the houses that moved off the campus were moved to Southside.

28:20.968 --> 28:23.071
There's still some over on Fairview.

28:23.712 --> 28:25.274
Yes, I remember.

28:25.294 --> 28:28.078
Williams, after he retired as president, he lived in one.

28:28.459 --> 28:33.386
The Colonel Anderson, Frank Anderson, they lived in a home that had been moved off the campus.

28:35.609 --> 28:36.450
Several on that street.

28:37.291 --> 28:38.833
Then there's some on out a little further.

28:39.775 --> 28:42.178
Now, who were your closest neighbors here?

28:42.715 --> 28:44.758
faculty and staff folks.

28:44.938 --> 28:47.982
Next door was Manning Price Entomology.

28:49.464 --> 28:52.789
Across the street was Gaddis Mechanical Engineering.

28:53.830 --> 28:57.676
Across the street was Randolph Entomology.

28:58.317 --> 29:01.501
And there was Ward in Ag Economics.

29:02.663 --> 29:10.714
And then Spike White, who was in ... See, when we built our house, when we first talked about it, there wasn't a street here.

29:11.167 --> 29:13.611
And our back fence was the City Limits for College Station.

29:14.051 --> 29:15.814
My, my, my.

29:16.575 --> 29:18.438
Was this part of a development?

29:18.698 --> 29:18.918
Yes.

29:19.339 --> 29:19.780
Who were?

29:20.260 --> 29:23.084
Clark, who was the head of the Department of Economics.

29:23.545 --> 29:24.727
Oh, he was one of the developers.

29:24.947 --> 29:26.629
He was the developer.

29:28.072 --> 29:31.076
Do you remember what the price was for the lot?

29:31.096 --> 29:32.057
Yes, $1,200 for two.

29:33.439 --> 29:34.441
We got two lots for $1,200.

29:34.861 --> 29:37.285
But when we built the house, we had a septic tank.

29:37.345 --> 29:38.727
We didn't wear it on a sewer line.

29:39.668 --> 29:41.551
Was there city water?

29:42.151 --> 29:42.372
Yes.

29:42.592 --> 29:42.892
Oh, yes.

29:43.613 --> 29:45.396
City water and electricity.

29:46.498 --> 29:49.582
But we had to have a sippy tank.

29:49.602 --> 29:55.009
And so that almost all of your neighbors were employed on the campus.

29:55.029 --> 29:56.311
All of them.

29:56.331 --> 30:02.820
And you, when you all were going to really buy groceries, where did you all drive?

30:04.022 --> 30:05.524
Went to Southside.

30:05.858 --> 30:07.640
Did you do your heavy grocery shopping there?

30:07.921 --> 30:08.141
Yes.

30:08.381 --> 30:09.203
Oh, okay.

30:09.223 --> 30:11.165
That was before really the supermarkets came in.

30:11.265 --> 30:11.706
Oh, okay.

30:13.488 --> 30:21.339
Then after the supermarkets came in, the first supermarket that came in that I remember right was one in downtown Bryan.

30:22.020 --> 30:25.024
The first one that had Piggly Wiggly, weren't they?

30:25.044 --> 30:28.329
The first one that had the, where everybody walked around and got what they wanted.

30:28.509 --> 30:29.250
Right.

30:30.310 --> 30:39.507
When we got here in 59, Ores on Texas Avenue, about halfway from here to Bryan, was where we went.

30:41.972 --> 30:42.853
You see, that was country.

30:43.394 --> 30:43.615
Right.

30:45.458 --> 30:52.892
I tell people that in the 50s, there was plenty of open space between Bryan and College Station.

30:53.497 --> 30:59.525
and to drive all the way to Bryan seemed to us a comparatively long distance.

30:59.686 --> 31:02.369
Yeah, particularly during the war, you allowed three gallons of gasoline.

31:02.950 --> 31:03.931
Right, right.

31:04.392 --> 31:05.293
A week.

31:06.815 --> 31:07.296
Let's see.

31:07.316 --> 31:09.800
I want to go back.

31:10.200 --> 31:13.024
I hope we didn't skip it, but we might have.

31:13.510 --> 31:28.910
Did you serve on any of the committees or anything that did any, made any recommendations about co-education or non-compulsory core or racial integration?

31:28.970 --> 31:30.292
Did you, do you remember?

31:30.372 --> 31:35.098
I didn't serve on any committees that focused on those problems, no, those questions.

31:35.899 --> 31:40.224
Do you remember any faculty or staff opposition to any of those changes?

31:40.605 --> 31:40.665
No.

31:41.405 --> 31:44.989
I think it was very acceptable to the people that I was around.

31:46.651 --> 31:49.734
As far as I knew, there was not much.

31:50.876 --> 32:03.430
And last week, the death of Bill Moore, I shared with a number of people my belief that, yes, he did deserve a lot of credit for being a positive person.
