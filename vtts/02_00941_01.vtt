00:04.807 --> 00:11.105
Good morning, this is Tonya with you on KOBJFM's 
news magazine, where our guest today is a city

00:04.807 --> 00:11.105
planner. He's director of environmental studies 
at St. Edward's University. We thought we'd ask

00:14.816 --> 00:20.031
him to talk to us a bit about Austin moving into the 
21st century. Our guest is Kevin Stowers. Hi,

00:21.806 --> 00:22.226
Kevin. We're real glad you could be with us today. 
Well, I'm glad to be here and glad you could ask me to

00:24.108 --> 00:27.171
come out. I've been eager to talk a little bit about 
Austin. Okay. What would you say are the major

00:30.294 --> 00:35.159
urban problems that are facing the U.S. at this 
point? Essentially, all of the good and bad things

00:36.200 --> 00:42.226
that you might see in our society seem to be very 
much congregated in our cities. It's kind of an

00:44.448 --> 00:46.170
obvious statement. But on the other hand, if you 
stop to consider the fact that we've only been an

00:46.437 --> 01:03.061
urban society since roughly the 1940s, this is 
really something of significance to suddenly see

00:46.437 --> 01:03.061
that we may have to find a new future for our cities. 
So are you saying that we've only been

01:03.081 --> 01:08.228
predominantly urban since the 40s here in the US? 
Oh, certainly. Really, in 1920, well over half the

01:09.269 --> 01:13.255
population lived on farms. And if you stop to think 
how many people you knew or any of us knew that grew

01:15.205 --> 01:27.667
up on farms versus how many we know today that grew 
up in cities, I think you can see this kind of shift

01:15.205 --> 01:27.667
in trends. Of course, the real problems facing the 
United States in many cases are problems facing

01:29.530 --> 01:37.183
all cities across the world. What are we going to do 
in terms of energy and technology in the future?

01:41.248 --> 01:48.655
We're facing essentially a situation where 
energy consumption patterns are being forced to

01:41.248 --> 01:48.655
change. We don't have the oil that we once had and 
relied on. We've really only gone through perhaps

01:53.400 --> 02:00.186
two or three major energy technologies in the 
history of man. We started out using wood. We

02:02.609 --> 02:06.192
eventually switched to coal as wood began to run 
short. And then we wound up going to oil in the 20th

02:06.678 --> 02:10.723
century. And this isn't the first energy crisis we 
faced in the US, and it's not the first energy

02:11.284 --> 02:17.091
crisis in the world. Every time we see a change in 
technology, we see all kinds of problems being

02:17.171 --> 02:23.940
generated because of this. And we've generally 
been very unsuccessful in predicting what the

02:24.661 --> 02:31.369
future is going to have after these kinds of 
changes. Well, are you saying essentially that

02:31.771 --> 02:39.740
the problems we face here in any of our cities in the 
U.S. then are going to be connected with the oil

02:31.771 --> 02:39.740
shortage? Well, I think that that's one of the 
problems we're facing, but we can't let energy per

02:40.481 --> 02:47.489
se dominate all of our perspectives. We've still 
got many of the same social and economic problems

02:47.529 --> 02:54.657
that we really only began to try to solve with the 
Roosevelt administration in the 30s and 40s. What

03:00.930 --> 03:03.133
are some examples of those? Poverty. We still got 
poverty. We still have poor people. In general, we

03:08.099 --> 03:13.947
always look at the population and say the older 
people seem to have more income problems. They

03:13.967 --> 03:15.930
don't tend to be as well off. And old people tend to 
live in cities. With our demographics, we see in

03:18.717 --> 03:26.607
the future increasingly a larger and larger 
percentage of our population is going to fall in

03:18.717 --> 03:26.607
this elderly class. And somehow we have to begin to 
deal with the fact that more of the workforce are

03:26.687 --> 03:44.630
less, you know, the workforce is essentially 
going to have to support a larger proportion of the

03:26.687 --> 03:44.630
population through Social Security, food 
stamps, Medicare, and a variety of other

03:26.687 --> 03:44.630
programs. And this is going to be a very expensive 
proposition. Well, maybe we're getting a little

03:49.126 --> 03:54.351
bit abstract for all of us who are living here in 
downtown Austin. Let's bring it back to Austin for

03:54.731 --> 03:56.453
a moment. What would you say are the major problems 
coming up in the next decade for Austin, Texas?

04:02.099 --> 04:14.110
Well, I think you can look at the city budget or the 
kind of issues that were raised by the city budget

04:02.099 --> 04:14.110
debate this past month or so and see exactly what's 
going to be ahead of us. There doesn't seem to be an

04:14.671 --> 04:16.973
end in sight in terms of inflation. I don't think 
it's going to be a rapidly cured event. And that's

04:23.911 --> 04:28.677
going to affect you, it's going to affect me, it's 
going to affect all of us in terms of our taxes.

04:29.178 --> 04:38.931
Because if we want to continue to have the kind of 
city that traditionally most of us think of Austin

04:29.178 --> 04:38.931
as being, it's not going to be an inexpensive 
proposition in the future. We're growing at a

04:39.812 --> 04:42.235
tremendously rapid rate. And among the things 
that are leading those inflation figures are such

04:42.603 --> 04:49.530
things as land. And we tend to think of Austin as 
being a pleasant place with lots of open space,

04:49.550 --> 05:01.862
lots of parks, fairly reasonable traffic 
situations, clean air, clean water. And those

05:02.543 --> 05:04.705
things don't really come cheaply. There's an 
economic cost associated with those. What

05:08.337 --> 05:12.483
currently are the bases for taxation here in 
Austin? How do you get taxed in Austin now? Well,

05:15.787 --> 05:18.511
you get taxed almost every time you turn around. It 
might seem a little facetious, but at the same

05:20.273 --> 05:29.446
time, if you stop to think, every time you buy a 
product that is not exempt, a portion of that sales

05:20.273 --> 05:29.446
tax goes to Austin. You get taxed through your 
property taxes. They tend to have in Austin a

05:32.772 --> 05:40.162
rather extensive fee structure, which seems to be 
broadening in terms of its scale. They're a

05:40.903 --> 05:53.319
pay-as-you-go philosophy that most economists 
would tend to support so that people recognize

05:40.903 --> 05:53.319
that there is a cost associated with playing a 
round of golf or being on a softball team and so

05:40.903 --> 05:53.319
forth. All of these may not be taxes in terms of the 
traditional sense, but they are part of the cost of

05:53.779 --> 06:01.429
operating a city. Well, now, do you mean to say that 
people who play golf are essentially being taxed?

06:06.754 --> 06:15.864
Well, the golfer, per se, does pay a portion of what 
it costs to operate that golf course and maintain

06:06.754 --> 06:15.864
it. His fee for a round of golf doesn't pay for the 
entire cost of maintaining that course. Part of

06:22.252 --> 06:24.654
that comes from property taxes. And the people 
that pay property taxes include not only the

06:24.674 --> 06:31.602
people who own real property, that is, a house or a 
lot... but also anyone who essentially rents a

06:32.088 --> 06:38.576
residence in Austin or an apartment. Well, how do 
renters end up paying the tax? Well, because

06:41.139 --> 06:45.985
that's a cost that your landlord is not going to 
absorb. He's in the business to make money, so he's

06:46.005 --> 06:53.655
got to find a way to make enough money to cover the 
cost of his mortgage, taxes, maintenance, and so

06:46.005 --> 06:53.655
forth. And he's going to pass all that on in terms of 
how much you pay for your rent. So is it fair then to

06:58.261 --> 07:01.825
say that the... Increase in rents recently is a 
result of the increase in property taxes. Oh, to

07:08.201 --> 07:10.765
some extent, I'm sure that's true. But there are a 
lot of things that go into determining how much you

07:11.165 --> 07:15.150
pay for rent. And taxes are probably only a minor 
part of it. A much larger part is the fact that there

07:19.375 --> 07:23.060
are a lot of people moving to Austin. It's a 
desirable place to live. And if all of a sudden the

07:25.102 --> 07:31.170
occupancy rate is very high for apartments, It's 
only obvious to the landlord that he can charge a

07:31.370 --> 07:35.575
higher rate. He's going to try to charge what he can 
get. So it's a supply and demand question. It's a

07:39.700 --> 07:41.021
supply and demand question. And part of that is 
taxes. The whole question of transportation is an

07:44.586 --> 07:49.291
interesting one because I think that's a real 
problem in Austin. It's going to be more of a

07:49.331 --> 07:53.136
problem in Austin. The larger the city grows, the 
harder it is to get around. You just simply have

07:56.079 --> 07:58.121
more area to cover. You've got more territory. 
You've got further distances. And essentially,

08:01.677 --> 08:10.093
most of us don't like to spend a lot of time in our 
car, yet we want to be absolutely free to make every

08:01.677 --> 08:10.093
trip we desire to make. It's obvious as the city 
gets larger that a couple of things have to happen.

08:15.844 --> 08:24.681
And among them, it's likely that you're going to 
see more freeways being built or interstate loop

08:15.844 --> 08:24.681
radial type controlled access highways. you're 
likely to see a little bit more emphasis being put

08:25.117 --> 08:38.252
into your mass transit system simply because you 
have a larger percentage of your population that

08:25.117 --> 08:38.252
is not going to be able to utilize automobiles in 
all of the trips. And that creates also additional

08:39.693 --> 08:48.263
demands in terms of economy because, again, that 
has to be paid for somehow. The federal government

08:48.283 --> 08:51.867
provides a 50% operating subsidy to many 
communities for mass transit. But the other 50%

08:55.967 --> 09:00.512
subsidy has to come from somewhere. Some 
communities have chosen to do that through a sales

09:00.692 --> 09:09.802
tax that has essentially been dedicated to the 
purpose of supporting transit. Other

09:10.162 --> 09:14.347
communities simply try to support it out of 
general revenue funds. That's what Austin is

09:14.367 --> 09:15.568
doing. And this is part of the problem every year, 
because all of a sudden, Austin comes up at the end

09:15.608 --> 09:21.955
of the budget And we've got so many good projects 
that need to be carried out that there's generally

09:22.627 --> 09:33.317
going to be a higher expenditure than income. And 
then the city council is faced with a very

09:34.058 --> 09:37.521
difficult dilemma. Do we want to raise taxes or 
user fees in order to accommodate that? Or two, do

09:44.488 --> 09:50.794
we want to make some cutbacks in some of these very 
beneficial, good programs? the last couple of

09:51.213 --> 10:15.870
years the city council has taken the view that 
maybe it's better to try to cut back and minimize

09:51.213 --> 10:15.870
some of those services somewhat in order to be able 
to avoid general tax increases well now is that the

09:51.213 --> 10:15.870
reason why we don't really have very good mass 
transit here in austin well that's only part of the

09:51.213 --> 10:15.870
reason essentially You don't tend to have what 
would be very good mass transit anywhere in North

10:16.880 --> 10:26.777
America, and by that you can include Mexico, 
Canada, as well as the United States. The real

10:26.797 --> 10:42.263
reason we don't have good mass transit is that our 
cities are designed for a transportation

10:26.797 --> 10:42.263
technology that is basically balanced against 
low density. In other words, we tend to emphasize

10:42.783 --> 10:47.408
the need for single family detached housing. 
Everybody wants to have a little quarter acre lot

10:47.428 --> 10:54.535
or 10,000 square feet, you know, with five or 10 
feet on the side yards. Everybody wants their

10:54.716 --> 10:55.757
land. Everybody wants a little bit of land. And the 
problem is that when you have these kinds of

10:58.199 --> 11:09.411
housing patterns, that doesn't tend to 
effectively feed, in an economic sense, a mass

10:58.199 --> 11:09.411
transit system. It's very suitable in terms of an 
automobile, but it's not very suitable for a bus or

11:13.225 --> 11:23.520
light rail or even rapid rail, heavy rail transit. 
And this is the real dilemma. Well, what is the

11:24.963 --> 11:32.374
solution then for people who would like to be able 
to use mass transit but don't want to give up their

11:24.963 --> 11:32.374
suburban life? Well, that's almost a no-win 
situation. It's a double-bind situation. I don't

11:39.124 --> 11:41.207
think you can effectively have both. because 
essentially you're going to pay a very high

11:41.525 --> 11:45.410
subsidy. You're going to have very high taxes to 
have good transit with large lot subdivisions, or

11:45.450 --> 11:56.185
two, you're going to have to give up the large lot 
subdivisions to have good transit. Well, are you

11:56.205 --> 12:01.593
visionary enough to imagine another way of 
building our city instead of in suburban lots?

12:01.613 --> 12:10.705
Well, I don't have to be visionary, particularly 
because people have been writing about this for

12:01.613 --> 12:10.705
essentially at least 30 or 40 years. There are 
alternatives, but we have to understand that the

12:12.440 --> 12:25.794
economies of scale, the capacity of transit 
systems vary according to how many people you can

12:12.440 --> 12:25.794
expect to get on in a given area. In other words, how 
many people can feed a station. Now, if you look at

12:29.418 --> 12:39.108
our average southwest United States city, we 
don't tend to have the kind of land use patterns

12:29.418 --> 12:39.108
that accommodate that. We tend to have If a typical 
subdivision is maybe a mile square, we might have

12:41.060 --> 12:46.328
1,000 houses there. And so we've got maybe 2,300, 
3,000 people living there. That's just not enough

12:52.458 --> 12:57.025
to effectively operate a mass transit system. 
Even if we run a bus through it, that still means

12:57.045 --> 13:03.856
there's a good chance somebody's going to have to 
walk a quarter or a half mile to get to it. And people

13:05.259 --> 13:07.422
don't like to walk that far. The alternative is 
probably going to be that we're going to see more

13:08.077 --> 13:24.572
garden apartments, townhouses, and that can 
support a more frequent transit system, whether

13:08.077 --> 13:24.572
it's a light rail or an effective bus system. And I 
think buses can do a very fine job of not advocating

13:24.592 --> 13:29.656
any particular form of transit. What it means is 
that we're simply going to have to see more people

13:30.897 --> 13:36.362
in our cities living in a higher density pattern if 
we're going to have effective transit. I think

13:40.813 --> 14:00.963
given a very high cost of housing, which has 
essentially excluded at least 60% and probably

13:40.813 --> 14:00.963
close to 80% or 90% of the American families out of 
traditional housing, combined with the energy

13:40.813 --> 14:00.963
shortage, we're going to see eventually a change 
in the direction of development in the future.

14:01.063 --> 14:05.590
We're going to continue to see low-density 
development because there will always be those

14:01.063 --> 14:05.590
who can afford it. But we're not going to have 
people being able to afford that in terms of the

14:06.143 --> 14:15.012
mass traditional sense of the American culture. 
I'm sorry, go ahead. I was going to say that

14:18.676 --> 14:28.266
traditionally the high point in terms of 
effective take-home pay for most workers was

14:18.676 --> 14:28.266
during the 1960s. In terms of effective 
purchasing power, they've never earned as much

14:28.286 --> 14:32.651
since. Oh, I didn't know that. I wasn't making too 
much in the 1960s, so I guess I just missed out. You

14:38.969 --> 14:41.714
missed out on the peak. But essentially, with 
inflation and the cost of living increases that

14:41.734 --> 14:53.131
most workers have been given, their buying power 
today is generally less than it was in, say, 64 or

14:41.734 --> 14:53.131
67. Oh, is that right? It's disappointing, isn't 
it? I can assure you it's disappointing because I

14:58.740 --> 15:02.526
wasn't making very much in 64. One of the things 
about Austin now is that there are still quite a lot

15:03.468 --> 15:13.082
of open spaces still available to us, even though 
it's getting big and there's a lot of people moving

15:03.468 --> 15:13.082
in. We have, for example, Town Lake. We have a place 
where within just a short drive you can be

15:15.425 --> 15:22.856
essentially in a natural setting. Do you see those 
kinds of areas being planned into the Austin of the

15:22.876 --> 15:27.282
future? Well, let me say that I think that despite 
some of our disappointments and traumas that we

15:28.342 --> 15:42.859
see when the city council meets, I think overall 
the city council and the city staff has really done

15:28.342 --> 15:42.859
a fairly good job. They've got a lot of 
limitations, they've got a lot of conflicts, but

15:42.880 --> 15:50.969
you see a lot of forward-looking thinking. The 
Parks Department, for instance, does tend to have

15:51.009 --> 15:57.437
some very good people on its staff. tend to be very 
oriented toward developing parks for the future.

16:02.712 --> 16:07.359
Now, one of the real complaints is that, gee, we 
don't see parks being developed. Well, part of the

16:07.419 --> 16:21.602
reason is they're spending so much of their money 
on acquisition of land, because they know if they

16:07.419 --> 16:21.602
don't get the land today, given the difficulties 
of the economy, there is very little chance

16:07.419 --> 16:21.602
they're going to effectively acquire the land or 
at least the necessary quantity of land in the

16:22.021 --> 16:25.426
future. And they are making an effort. And they are 
making a definite effort to do that. Oh, that's

16:28.831 --> 16:30.714
great, isn't it? And this is one area which the city 
voters have traditionally always supported in

16:30.734 --> 16:45.396
terms of rather heavy referendum turnouts, that 
they will vote to spend money to acquire parkland.

16:45.557 --> 16:49.783
And I think that that's something that's 
necessary if we're going to maintain... quality

16:51.198 --> 17:05.498
associated with Austin that a lot of us tend to 
think back and remember, say, from the late 60s or

16:51.198 --> 17:05.498
early 50s or whenever it was that you happen to 
remember your favorite Austin as being. Well,

17:05.518 --> 17:07.340
then, do you think that there...

17:10.605 --> 17:17.674
Does the city of Austin seem to be taking into 
account the idea that we're going to have to have

17:10.605 --> 17:17.674
more density, more apartments, more 
condominiums? Well... Yes, but see, the real

17:20.054 --> 17:30.484
problem is where are you going to put those, 
because you tend to get a lot of resistance from

17:20.054 --> 17:30.484
existing landowners and existing property 
owners. There is a lot of conversion going on.

17:33.187 --> 17:35.149
There is a lot of infill housing. You see a fair 
amount of apartments being built. I think the city

17:39.093 --> 17:45.960
staff recognizes this, and I think in general the 
city staff and the city council are very aware that

17:46.750 --> 17:54.180
Most of us, perhaps, or many of us, cannot afford to 
continue to buy a four-bedroom house with a

17:46.750 --> 17:54.180
swimming pool out back. And there is a real concern 
that we've somehow got to fulfill the housing

17:54.861 --> 18:00.328
needs of the population. And one of the ways to do 
that is through lower economical housing styles,

18:00.669 --> 18:07.138
and that is higher density by definition. There 
doesn't seem to be as much willingness

18:08.540 --> 18:14.007
traditionally among most homeowners to have a 
townhouse or condominium or apartment go in

18:14.459 --> 18:20.791
across the street from them. And they have some 
very legitimate concerns, one of which is

18:20.811 --> 18:24.918
property values. And this is one of the reasons you 
see neighborhood associations being formed.

18:29.246 --> 18:38.543
They are very concerned that in some cases the 
entire character of their neighborhood is being

18:29.246 --> 18:38.543
changed radically and that there is too much 
attention being paid to the needs of these

18:39.080 --> 18:45.585
newcomers or to the needs of speculators and 
developers. And I can sympathize with both sides.

18:48.208 --> 18:54.753
I don't think it's an easy solution for a city 
councilman to go one way or the other. There has to

18:55.013 --> 18:57.075
be a balance between the two. And I think that 
inevitably what you tend to see is an increasing

18:57.936 --> 19:08.985
percentage of your housing stock being devoted to 
multifamily housing. Now, I could well be wrong in

19:09.455 --> 19:21.550
this because the traditional direction of most 
urban development has always been toward a

19:09.455 --> 19:21.550
decentralization, toward lower densities. Part 
of the problem is the U.S. Census Bureau hasn't

19:22.751 --> 19:27.678
really told us what that 1980 census said. We have 
some ideas what it probably said, but

19:28.418 --> 19:36.188
traditionally from 1940 to 50 to 60 to 70, 
continually, Cities tended to be centralized,

19:36.623 --> 19:40.312
they tended toward lower densities. The city of 
Austin has a viable downtown, and I don't mean to

19:41.094 --> 19:53.586
discourage that notion, but on the other hand, it 
is certainly a changing downtown, and it's much

19:41.094 --> 19:53.586
less important to Travis County as a whole or the 
city of Austin as a whole than it was perhaps 20 or 30

19:54.190 --> 19:59.358
years ago. So you see, another issue for Austin in 
the future might be to maintain the trend toward

19:59.758 --> 20:06.609
revitalizing the Austin downtown. Oh, 
absolutely. This is KOBJ-FM's News Magazine, and

20:08.652 --> 20:17.706
we're speaking today with Kevin Stowers, who is 
the Director of Environmental Studies at St.

20:08.652 --> 20:17.706
Edward University and a city planner by 
profession. Kevin, why don't you give us sort of a

20:18.587 --> 20:20.670
summary of what you see as the major concerns for 
Austin as we move into the future, when you look at

20:20.735 --> 20:27.742
it from the city planner's viewpoint? Well, I 
think that there are essentially perhaps five or

20:27.762 --> 20:34.529
six kind of major concerns we have to have. One 
deals with economics. Can we maintain an

20:37.973 --> 20:42.918
effective and efficient and economical city 
government? And at the same time, maintain the

20:43.759 --> 20:47.603
quality of Austin that we would all like to see. And 
in terms of quality, we can talk in terms of a

20:51.876 --> 20:55.882
variety of issues. There are frequent community 
hearings at various levels. And if you see a

21:00.870 --> 21:09.202
proposal for a zoning variance being granted, the 
city is very active and concerned about trying to

21:00.870 --> 21:09.202
get input. They put little signs out front saying, 
call this number if you're interested because

21:09.783 --> 21:16.813
we're getting ready to see something happen on 
this piece of property. You ought to call. You

21:18.540 --> 21:21.003
ought to make your opinion known. And most of our 
neighborhoods have neighborhood

21:21.023 --> 21:25.188
organizations. Find out who they are and where 
they are and go to the meetings. Because the future

21:29.813 --> 21:37.262
of your neighborhood, your children, your 
property is really very much at stake. And perhaps

21:37.282 --> 21:42.328
you don't agree with everything I've said or see 
happening in the future. But it's up to you to be

21:42.747 --> 21:47.211
involved and make sure that your views are 
represented. Because if you don't, the future of

21:47.631 --> 21:52.295
Austin may not be really what you would like it to 
be. Kevin, what would you say you would like to see

21:52.836 --> 21:56.279
happen? What would you call a good Austin in the 
future? Well, I think that there are perhaps two or

21:59.381 --> 22:04.205
three things that I think that are essential for 
our future. One is that I think that it's

22:05.667 --> 22:12.012
imperative that we have a good, effective transit 
system. I don't think that given the direction of

22:12.447 --> 22:27.545
the energy problem that we see today that we should 
be in a position of being concerned from a

22:12.447 --> 22:27.545
year-to-year basis where the money for transit is 
coming from. I think we have to have a dedicated

22:27.565 --> 22:31.129
source of revenue for that purpose. I think we need 
a more frequent transit service and expanded

22:31.790 --> 22:35.434
routes. i also think that we effectively have to 
maintain our park system our library system the

22:36.224 --> 22:59.042
cultural life of austin essentially what has made 
austin unique in character i can't tell you how

22:36.224 --> 22:59.042
often when somebody moves to austin i've been told 
they said they've been told that, gee, you're

23:00.102 --> 23:02.366
going to really like Austin. It's really a nice 
place. It's a good place to live. There are lots of

23:05.831 --> 23:08.415
nice things about it. And I don't think any of us 
want to lose that through economy. And by economy,

23:14.264 --> 23:16.748
that would be false economy. I think we ought to be 
efficient. I think we ought to be effective and

23:18.751 --> 23:21.055
professional. But I don't think we want to lose the 
essential character of Austin. And I think if we

23:25.422 --> 23:27.645
began to cut back and particularly open space, 
environmental quality, we're going to begin to

23:27.878 --> 23:35.572
lose some of that unique character. Well, I'd have 
to agree with you completely, but maybe the

23:36.454 --> 23:48.476
devil's advocate would say, well, where are we 
going to save money when the budget is so high that

23:36.454 --> 23:48.476
people can't afford to pay their taxes anymore? 
Well, There are always people that can't afford to

23:49.259 --> 23:52.003
pay taxes. I would like to know exactly which 
individuals so I can be sympathetic with them and

23:52.023 --> 23:58.253
try to figure something out. The elderly now have 
tax exemptions available. They may not be as much

24:02.580 --> 24:07.728
as they should be, but it's certainly a beginning 
step. Food is tax exempt. It should be. There are

24:10.613 --> 24:16.903
states in the union where the sales tax does exist 
on food, and I'm glad it doesn't in Texas. medical

24:17.339 --> 24:18.841
care is exempted. There is an attempt to exempt at 
least some of the most essential things. I think

24:23.127 --> 24:39.251
the idea of a lifeline rate in terms of utilities 
would be very beneficial for Austin because we see

24:23.127 --> 24:39.251
essentially the tradition of utilities is to 
encourage consumption. Many of our rates and many

24:41.825 --> 25:06.972
utilities across the nation are designed 
essentially with the intent of encouraging an

24:41.825 --> 25:06.972
increase in consumption i don't think that's 
proper today given our energy problems i think we

24:41.825 --> 25:06.972
need to encourage conservation and by 
effectively encouraging people to use less

24:41.825 --> 25:06.972
electricity and giving breaks to those small 
users we can help some of those people that are

24:41.825 --> 25:06.972
having problems with their income and their 
budgets. And I think that's one area that we can

25:09.427 --> 25:14.493
give some assistance in. So you're essentially 
saying that it is possible to keep the good life in

25:14.513 --> 25:22.122
Austin and not have it taxed to death? Well, I hope 
it is. It's more of a statement of faith on my part at

25:24.225 --> 25:28.591
this stage, but I think it is. Well, this has been 
enjoyable. Got a few new thoughts to think about in

25:32.534 --> 25:37.852
terms of Austin, Texas, and I appreciate very much 
you being with us today. Thank you so much. Thank

25:39.718 --> 25:40.460
you for having me. This is Tonya Wells. I've been 
speaking with Kevin Stowers on KOBJ-FM's News

25:42.326 --> 25:45.818
Magazine.
