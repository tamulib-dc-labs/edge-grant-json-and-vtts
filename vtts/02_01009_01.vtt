00:07.793 --> 00:16.104
This is an interview with John Parrish by Von Pig on 
November 26, 1988 at John's apartment concerning

00:07.793 --> 00:16.104
the Vietnam War. In the interest of accumulating 
knowledge about the war, I'm going to donate this

00:17.165 --> 00:25.997
tape to the Texas A&M Oral History Collection in 
the University Archives. Is this okay with you?

00:27.178 --> 00:28.560
That's fine with me. All right. John, could you 
please tell me when you were born? I was born May 14,

00:34.388 --> 00:36.812
1949. Okay, and where? I was born in Mineral Wells, 
Texas. Could you also please tell me...

00:46.766 --> 00:51.874
I went through school, finished high school, got 
12 hours of college. That's

00:53.156 --> 00:56.500
about it. Okay. When did you join the Army, John? 
1967, December. Why'd you join? Well, at the time,

01:02.705 --> 01:09.011
in the neighborhood that we grew up in, that's what 
everybody had to do, more or less. Everybody went

01:10.532 --> 01:15.577
in before you, and it was just a thing to do, and they 
just won't get you sooner or later. So you weren't

01:17.158 --> 01:17.979
drafted. This wasn't voluntary? I volunteered 
for the draft. Volunteered for the draft.

01:25.646 --> 01:30.670
Could you give me a brief sketch about your 
military career before you went to Vietnam? Okay,

01:31.342 --> 01:34.506
but I went in December of 1967. They sent me to Fort 
Polk, Louisiana for boot camp. From there I stayed

01:39.912 --> 01:46.039
at Fort Polk for another eight weeks of AIT. And 
from there they sent me to Germany. I was there in

01:51.525 --> 01:58.193
Germany for approximately five, six months where 
I reenlisted three years to leave Germany to go to

01:51.525 --> 01:58.193
Vietnam. And then from Germany, after 
reenlisting, I went to Vietnam. All right. Where

02:05.941 --> 02:10.585
were you stationed in Vietnam?

02:10.605 --> 02:18.693
I was stationed on the Delta for seven, eight 
months in a small town called Ben Thuy. And the last

02:18.713 --> 02:27.741
year and a half, I served just outside of Pleiku in 
the Central Highlands. What units were you

02:29.695 --> 02:37.105
stationed with, first at Ventui and then up at... 
At Ventui, I think I was with the 34th Engineers.

02:39.949 --> 02:48.801
And then when I went north to the Central Highlands 
to be with my brother, my twin brother, that was the

02:39.949 --> 02:48.801
B Battery 1st and 92nd Artillery.

02:54.603 --> 03:01.351
And this artillery unit was stationed close to 
Pleiku up in the Central Highlands area, right?

03:01.371 --> 03:06.757
Yeah, so the unit B battery was located out in the 
field on a fire sport base. Our base camp was

03:08.819 --> 03:10.001
Pleiku. What was your rank during your tenure at 
Vietnam? Well, I finished as an E-5, and the time I

03:15.527 --> 03:22.315
was up there, field grade. It went so fast. As soon 
as I got up to Central Highlands, I was a spec four.

03:28.603 --> 03:31.627
And no time at all, I was an E-5. How long were you in 
Vietnam? Two years. Two years. Did you volunteer

03:38.534 --> 03:42.418
for a second tour during that time? I volunteered 
twice. I volunteered a third time, but it was

03:44.400 --> 03:46.282
turned down. Turned down.

03:50.727 --> 03:52.369
And what was your MOS? I finished up as a 13 Echo 20 as 
a recon sergeant.

04:06.215 --> 04:12.889
John, could you please describe the job of your 
unit and what they were there for? The B Battery was

04:14.540 --> 04:18.364
mainly for support in that region. We were located 
in a very high hilltop and it was mainly for support

04:18.845 --> 04:26.354
for any units or any other bases that was around us. 
It was mainly for support, fire support,

04:26.474 --> 04:31.360
artillery support. So y'all would be called upon 
by units in the field for artillery support any

04:31.380 --> 04:38.488
time? Were you called on by the American Army or the 
South Vietnamese Army or both? In our region,

04:45.705 --> 04:47.609
there was no American infantry. The region we was 
in was all Vietnamese. We had some Korean

04:52.158 --> 04:53.701
soldiers. We were called the Rocks. And we had 
mountain yards. It was led by the Special Forces

04:57.669 --> 04:59.633
units.

05:03.680 --> 05:05.081
All right. Why don't you describe your job to me and 
what you did? Okay. My main job, and this is when I

05:10.367 --> 05:21.578
went to the Central Highlands, was when I first 
started out, my MOS did not include artillery. I

05:21.678 --> 05:23.760
never had artillery training whatsoever. And I 
left the Delta to be with my twin brother. He was

05:27.724 --> 05:29.586
mainly artilleryman. And I wanted to be up there 
with them, and I finally got the approval to go to be

05:30.545 --> 05:35.794
with him. So we was together, and I basically 
started out being a journeyman, OJT training. And

05:42.905 --> 05:49.215
I started out just breaking open powder canisters 
for the 155 pouch. That's how I started out. And I

05:51.259 --> 05:53.262
winded up being a board observer. All right, could 
you describe what you would do as a forward

05:54.743 --> 05:59.248
observer? As a forward observer, we'd go out, we'd 
try to find out what unit or what job, what specific

05:59.268 --> 06:07.939
job you would have to do. It could be anywhere from 
going out with an RV division, a mountain yard

06:08.519 --> 06:15.087
division, or a company. They had four companies 
called Mike Strike Units, or you could have been on

06:15.548 --> 06:20.093
a convoy unit. And your job as an FO, if you were an 
FO, an FO was to call in artillery fire. An RTO,

06:28.878 --> 06:34.346
which I was an RTO also, you had to start out as an 
RTO, then an FO. An RTO was a radio operator. You

06:36.448 --> 06:37.330
carried the radio. So I did all those things. All 
right. Describe a daily routine that you would

06:44.499 --> 06:48.865
follow at your base camp or if you were out as a 
former

06:49.216 --> 06:55.783
observer? Well, let's see. I'm trying to see which 
way to go with this. I played two parts. I guess I can

07:03.190 --> 07:11.819
go ahead and say or talk about mainly our life on the 
fire support base because that was home. If you

07:12.719 --> 07:18.345
wasn't out there in the bush as an FO or a G.O., you 
was up here on this fire support base. This fire

07:18.697 --> 07:26.466
support base was located in a high mountain ridge, 
and the only way to get up there was by helicopter.

07:26.486 --> 07:30.551
And that's where you lived, and you lived in what we 
called hooches. And you dug holes into the

07:30.571 --> 07:40.423
mountain, filled sandbags, and you protected it 
with sandbags and also some metal pieces if you

07:30.571 --> 07:40.423
were lucky to find them. And then in order to keep 
you dry, if you were lucky, you got elephant hide.

07:46.338 --> 07:48.600
You lived up there in this little fire base. Your 
main job was to mainly give support.

07:56.727 --> 07:59.829
If everything was quiet, mainly you kept the guns 
clean. You kept them swabbed down. You cleaned out

08:01.991 --> 08:03.252
the breaches. You made sure that everything was in 
working order.

08:08.217 --> 08:10.238
How long were you up on this fire base? On the fire 
base, just off and on, I was up there a year and a

08:10.979 --> 08:15.002
half. A year and a half. What kind of conditions, 
living conditions, did y'all have? I mean, just

08:19.899 --> 08:23.784
describe your hoochies, you know, where you 
slept. Did y'all have hot food or sea rats most of

08:24.284 --> 08:28.249
the time? The conditions on this fire base was bad, 
real bad. Of course, you lived in hoochies and you

08:34.136 --> 08:36.980
lived underground. It was cold. When it rained in 
the monsoon, it was damp, muddy. Rats were so bad,

08:43.456 --> 08:46.299
you had to leave your boots on. You had to sleep with 
your clothes on because the rats nibble you or eat

08:46.760 --> 08:51.625
at you. They'd eat everything you had.

08:55.949 --> 08:58.452
They tried to get us hot food up there once a week. 
They tried. They kept us supplied with water.

09:02.517 --> 09:07.662
Everything

09:02.517 --> 09:07.662
came in by chopper. And our water ration, they try 
to keep us enough water supply. So we mainly ate sea

09:14.619 --> 09:16.182
rations. As

09:18.226 --> 09:25.380
far as showers, we had a little shower stall. and 
you punch holes in it, somebody would get a

09:27.132 --> 09:32.959
canister. You was allowed three canisters of 
water. When the water came in, you was allowed

09:36.283 --> 09:37.965
three. And you'd get it, pour it through the hole, 
and that was your shower. But if you didn't have any

09:42.350 --> 09:44.333
water, you didn't take a shower. So the conditions 
up there on this fire base was bad, real bad.

09:48.738 --> 09:49.399
Terribly bad. Flies, mosquitoes, spiders, you 
name it. It was bad.

10:01.080 --> 10:05.305
Did the VC or the NVA bother y'all much on this fire 
base? Were y'all under mortar attack constantly?

10:08.808 --> 10:10.971
In the year and a half, there was a long fight. 
Probably about three, four months was a long

10:11.171 --> 10:14.314
fight. Usually that hit you with harassments, 
mortar rounds. Usually if a helicopter came in,

10:20.281 --> 10:24.105
they'd hit you with a rocket fire. They launched 
some ground attacks against us, but we weren't

10:24.912 --> 10:38.004
ever under siege as far as our fire base. There came 
a time where the Tet Offensive came in where we were

10:38.044 --> 10:52.337
up countless days and nights firing, and also from 
the ground attacks, but that was probably, the Tet

10:38.044 --> 10:52.337
Offensive lasted about a month. Most of it was 
mostly rocket and mortar round attacks.

11:00.992 --> 11:02.634
Most of this come at night? Yeah, the ground 
attacks came at night, but the mortar rounds and

11:04.416 --> 11:10.283
rocket rounds, they hit you in the daytime. Did

11:10.323 --> 11:17.332
you ever get to go back to the rear during this year 
and a half? You have a Saigon R&R. How often did that

11:19.675 --> 11:21.717
happen? So you got an R&R every six months where 
they ask you if you want to go to Taipei, Bangkok,

11:22.304 --> 11:33.679
Hawaii, the Philippines, Japan, whatever. And I 
usually went to Taipei. The girls are pretty

11:36.422 --> 11:43.131
there.

11:44.309 --> 11:54.607
I mean, I guess in the rear what we most guys doing is 
okay in the rear and our rear was plate to that was

11:44.309 --> 11:54.607
the city. And that was our main attachment. That's 
where headquarters was. And that was called

11:58.573 --> 12:00.697
artillery here. It was in the city and the life back 
in the city was like living in Holland Park. You

12:07.310 --> 12:11.358
went to the rear to play coup to headquarters 
battalion. That was like living in Highland Park.

12:12.961 --> 12:14.986
I mean, you had all the necessities you needed 
there. You name it, you had it. So that was like,

12:17.370 --> 12:23.844
man, just leaving the slums of East Dallas and 
going to Highland Park. That was the difference.

12:27.190 --> 12:27.411
All right. Did the... The Army trained you 
adequately to do your job in the field? Well, the

12:33.952 --> 12:35.975
Army didn't train me to do my job. I learned OJT. My 
twin brother was trained in the artillery

12:38.439 --> 12:43.547
business, and he went to Fort Sill. But I went from 
the south of Vietnam, and I was a radio operator

12:43.567 --> 12:54.102
down there for an engineer unit. And I didn't see 
any combat. I didn't see nothing down there. So I

12:57.243 --> 12:59.308
wanted to be with my twin brother. And I think even 
today, I think it's a rarity that my twin and I were

12:59.368 --> 13:05.882
together in a combat situation up in the Central 
Highlands. And both of us came forward observers.

13:11.148 --> 13:14.312
My job down there was very easy, and I was trained 
for that job. But once I left there and went to the

13:14.332 --> 13:21.700
Central Highlands to be with my brother to be on 
these guns, I had zero training, zero. And my only

13:22.380 --> 13:27.967
training to become an FO was when we was getting hit 
by mortar rounds. And I was calling in support from

13:28.868 --> 13:35.815
another fire base to give us support because we was 
getting hit. And after I got through with calling

13:36.496 --> 13:39.940
in these rounds, My first sergeant said, hey, 
that's great. You're going to be an FO. And then he

13:44.548 --> 13:48.893
sent my brother and I to train to an FO school for one 
week. And then when I came back up, I became an FO.

13:53.679 --> 13:55.000
Let's get a more general scale.

13:58.504 --> 14:03.090
Your staff NCOs, the majority of them, were they 
trained well enough to do their job? Or was it more

14:03.551 --> 14:09.758
of a hurry up, let's get more people in here and see 
what they can do? We're always at our NCOs. I would

14:13.819 --> 14:22.750
feel,

14:13.819 --> 14:22.750
when I look back at it now, that's a question I 
wouldn't ask. That's the first time I've been

14:22.850 --> 14:24.592
asked that. I always say, looking back today, that 
they wouldn't train that well. I don't think they

14:28.397 --> 14:29.198
were. Because most of them lived in fear, and they 
wanted out. They were out there in the field for six

14:34.747 --> 14:38.951
months, and that was it when they got out. Officers 
and NCOs, and I'm saying E6 or E7 and above served

14:39.592 --> 14:50.624
six months in the field, and they were back out 
again. So they didn't really care. What about the

14:54.187 --> 14:55.469
officers? The officers didn't play a very minor 
role because the men wouldn't listen to an

14:55.489 --> 15:01.375
officer. They had no respect for an officer. Okay. 
Why was this? Were the officers just not prepared

15:06.186 --> 15:08.449
or didn't care? Yeah, the officers were what we 
refer to 90-day wonders. They went to school and

15:12.594 --> 15:15.617
they learned something so quick inside of three 
months. They came back out and they had to serve

15:15.657 --> 15:22.025
their six months in the field or the bush. And then 
once they got out there, they was not prepared.

15:26.650 --> 15:30.735
They was only prepared by the textbook of what they 
were taught in the books. Once they got out there,

15:31.496 --> 15:33.138
things changed. Things were different. And they 
were ill-prepared for that because it didn't

15:34.788 --> 15:38.812
work. It just didn't work. The officers seemed 
more concerned about their careers, going to

15:43.557 --> 15:52.585
Vietnam, getting their ticket punched, 
advancing their career for later stages. I can't

15:54.347 --> 15:55.368
really say that. From the officers that I knew that 
came up, there was quite a few. They just wanted to

16:04.285 --> 16:06.727
come up and serve their time and get the hell out. So 
more or less, they just punched in and wanted out.

16:10.671 --> 16:11.352
And that was it. They didn't want to stay out in the 
field. Was your unit a pretty close group up on this

16:15.676 --> 16:20.580
fire base? High sense of camaraderie, high 
spirit? Well, the fire base that we was on, fire

16:24.024 --> 16:33.853
base six, there was a total of, I would say, 40 to 50 
men. on this little fire base. And we were divided.

16:38.871 --> 16:44.120
You had your Blacks, your Whites, you had your 
Dopers, and the Alkies. You had your Northerns,

16:44.140 --> 16:47.126
and you had your Southerns. So it was very divided. 
When everything was quiet, it was divided.

16:54.151 --> 16:57.717
Let's discuss some of the different operations 
that you would go on. If I could have you to describe

16:59.340 --> 17:04.489
an operation that you can remember that was a 
success. A success would be one where I went out on a

17:06.051 --> 17:18.032
chopper and I had to replace an RTO, a radio 
operator, in Coppolaire and they had to extract

17:06.051 --> 17:18.032
him out of the jungle. And of course, you know, 
before you went out to the jungle, you had to go back

17:18.653 --> 17:24.418
to headquarters and get briefed on what you had to 
do. And they'd give you an SOP book and everything.

17:26.380 --> 17:29.062
They gave you a map and everything else. Now, they 
flew me out by this one, by this chopper, and they

17:29.082 --> 17:32.665
flew me in. And they dropped me into it, and they was 
waiting on me. And while we were there, it was all

17:36.369 --> 17:40.172
mountain yards. And the leader of the group was a 
guy named King Groot. He was a Green Beret. They

17:43.655 --> 17:44.576
called him King Groot. You know, they didn't have 
any names. They had nicknames. His name was

17:47.223 --> 17:48.405
Kangaroo. The main objective of this bunch was to 
hit and run. And I was there just long enough where I

17:53.612 --> 17:58.499
almost got picked to do the hit and run. But I think 
the guy that was with me, the guy that, the FO, he

17:58.519 --> 18:08.873
told Kangaroo, he says, well, I'm a little bit too 
green. I can't do this hit and run. So at the last

18:11.084 --> 18:14.989
minute, he managed to pull me out of it. So the basic 
objective of this group is to do a hit and run on an

18:15.009 --> 18:24.122
NVA unit that was around, and to kill as many as they 
could, and then we can get the hell out. And that's

18:24.382 --> 18:25.724
what happened. I went out, made a hit and run, and 
then for two days ran.

18:33.294 --> 18:39.302
What about a failure in any particular incident 
that something just completely fell apart

18:42.337 --> 18:43.159
That you remember? Failure. I can't think of a 
failure. I really can't. I can't think of a

18:49.371 --> 18:52.357
breakdown at all. Okay. Well, let's get into the 
situation here. You're a Fort Observer calling an

18:57.748 --> 19:00.092
artillery fire. Was this fire fairly accurate? 
Uh, it all depended on the group that you had, you

19:04.932 --> 19:08.357
know. I was up there on those guns and I knew that 
drugs were bad. And if the guys came up there and

19:13.884 --> 19:23.517
they had a bad attitude, and there were always bad 
attitudes, there were drugs, you could get a round

19:13.884 --> 19:23.517
that would land right on top of him, you know. You 
just didn't know. You just hoped that you got the

19:24.578 --> 19:28.223
best group of guys on the right gun section. you 
know, and hope that that group got it, and they

19:28.625 --> 19:33.655
caught it in the fire. But there was some times 
where they caught it, boy, they dropped it right on

19:33.675 --> 19:37.342
top of it. Right on top.

19:42.051 --> 19:43.694
Let me close that door real quick. All right.

19:50.427 --> 19:51.409
I didn't sign 10.

19:57.582 --> 20:04.330
Your unit was basically attached with ARVN units 
and mountain yards and some Korean soldiers. What

20:04.350 --> 20:07.734
did you think of the South Vietnamese Army? I was 
very dissatisfied with the South Vietnamese

20:07.754 --> 20:10.618
soldiers. They didn't care. Their morale was low. 
It was ragtag. They didn't care. When you went out

20:17.506 --> 20:23.353
with them, they kind of went out like they just 
didn't care, like, you know, go off through the

20:23.873 --> 20:28.462
bush, and if they see a trail, they'd follow the 
trail. It didn't make any sense. If you were with

20:31.348 --> 20:35.696
the mountain yards, it was a very strict 
discipline group. They would make their own way,

20:35.716 --> 20:43.091
but the orange was a very poor discipline, low 
morale group. Very poor. So that base could have

20:44.647 --> 20:47.371
cared less whether they won the war or not? That's 
exactly the feeling we got. We knew it. Do they

20:51.958 --> 20:58.527
just, I mean, one government under North 
Vietnamese rule or one government South

20:51.958 --> 20:58.527
Vietnamese rule? Well, there's a lot of, you know, 
there's a lot of hatred between South Vietnamese

20:59.048 --> 21:07.521
soldiers and American soldiers when we was up 
there on this little fire base. When the

21:07.541 --> 21:11.727
Vietnamese was on the perimeter, there was a lot of 
hatred. A lot of hatred. There were times where it

21:12.997 --> 21:19.928
came very close where we almost had firefights 
with them, right there on the hilltop. So there was

21:19.948 --> 21:21.651
a lot of hatred. There was no rapport or 
cooperation whatsoever.

21:31.447 --> 21:35.834
The mountain yards that I've read were good 
fighters? Excellent fighters. Excellent. What

21:39.710 --> 21:41.231
was their basic goals? I mean, they would seem to be 
just a tribal unit within South Vietnam. What were

21:46.516 --> 21:49.479
their goals in this war? It's kind of hard to say 
because, you know, the Special Forces, or Mag V,

21:49.499 --> 21:56.785
trained them. So what their objective was, what 
their goals were in that region is hard to say

21:57.846 --> 22:04.533
because I can't answer that. I can't answer that. 
But they were excellent soldiers. Excellent. Did

22:09.764 --> 22:10.925
the Koreans perform? Yeah, the Koreans did. They 
was a rock hard unit. They did an excellent job.

22:17.993 --> 22:20.936
They were very hard and very skilled. Very good 
soldiers. They fought very well.

22:27.023 --> 22:29.906
Did you ever interact with the Vietnamese people 
much? Yes. What did they think about the war? I

22:36.646 --> 22:52.157
think Vietnamese people look more at the war, not 
so much as the war, as they were caught up in the city

22:36.646 --> 22:52.157
dwelling and the city life as far as just getting 
the soldiers money, the economy, and all the money

22:36.646 --> 22:52.157
that came with it. That's all they cared about. 
They just reaped the profits. Black market, yeah,

22:55.423 --> 22:57.928
you betcha, black market. Whatever they could 
make a buck on, that's all they cared about. Dad

23:00.985 --> 23:05.009
didn't care about the war he won or he lost, as long 
as they made the bucks off the GI. That's all they

23:05.590 --> 23:11.056
cared about.

23:11.737 --> 23:17.263
They just wanted to have rice on their table at 
night, enough food to eat. Well, whatever they

23:18.163 --> 23:19.965
wanted the money for. What did the South 
Vietnamese people think about the North

23:20.886 --> 23:24.270
Vietnamese? or I guess there's really not that 
much of a distinction. That was a distinction we

23:27.164 --> 23:28.927
gave everything. What they thought about the 
communist regime in the North, in Ho Chi Minh.

23:34.694 --> 23:34.874
Yeah. Von, you know, you got to remember I was 18 
years old. 18, 19 years old. And I couldn't begin to

23:42.183 --> 23:45.647
comprehend that type of thinking. I couldn't even 
begin to think. So, you know, you asked me a

23:47.009 --> 23:49.712
question at the time I never thought of. Okay. All 
right. Did you... How much involvement, or did the

23:55.435 --> 24:00.603
North Vietnamese follow y'all that much at the 
time? NVA units, or did y'all basically have VC? We

24:04.269 --> 24:06.312
basically had VC in the area. But the NVA would 
launch an offensive, mainly doing the Tet

24:06.332 --> 24:11.019
Offensive. They'd launch an offensive. And in our 
region, They'd be very heavy doing the 10

24:13.880 --> 24:16.285
offensive. Very heavy in our region. Extremely 
heavy. But they never did bowler's in most of the

24:18.529 --> 24:22.617
VCs that bowler has. The NVA good soldiers? They 
were good fighters. Intense. Yeah, they were

24:27.186 --> 24:28.448
good. Well trained, well armed. And the VC were 
just... in and out, never knew where they were? Oh,

24:37.162 --> 24:39.867
they were in and out, but you know, their 
dedication is what carried them. You know, that's

24:40.268 --> 24:49.265
what made the distinction between a South 
Vietnamese soldier who was well armed and well

24:40.268 --> 24:49.265
supposedly trained as a player to the VC. You know, 
they were just a ragtag farmer during the day and a

24:50.106 --> 24:58.602
soldier at night, you know, was their dedication, 
what they believed in. And that was a difference

24:58.936 --> 25:00.638
out there. So that made the B.C. a well-trained 
individual for what he believed in. Before we

25:09.987 --> 25:16.193
started this interview on tape, I was asked some 
questions about and brought up anti-war

25:09.987 --> 25:16.193
demonstrators. Could you tell me your feelings 
about these people on tape? I dislike them. I hate

25:24.201 --> 25:24.842
them. I have a lot of hatred for him even today. I 
can't find one today that admit that he was a

25:30.514 --> 25:36.487
demonstrator. To me they're just chickens. They 
just backed out. They're scared. They're scared

25:43.943 --> 25:46.729
now to admit what they were now. And that just goes 
to show you what they was afraid of back then.

25:51.272 --> 25:54.155
They're just a lot of bunch of chickens, all they 
are. They didn't have enough guts, enough pride,

25:54.195 --> 26:01.304
nothing to stand up what they believed in. And at 
least if they didn't believe in it, just stand

26:01.584 --> 26:06.350
behind their government. And I hate them. I hate 
them. During your tour in Vietnam, did you feel

26:13.038 --> 26:17.003
that you were doing the right thing? Yes. With 
Vietnamese people? Well, I didn't look at it like

26:19.639 --> 26:21.662
that. I felt like it was the right thing to serve my 
country. That's what I looked at. The utmost was

26:26.789 --> 26:29.353
I'm serving my country. That's what I'm looking 
at. I never thought about going over there and

26:31.055 --> 26:34.120
protecting the South of Vietnam. Never once 
crossed my mind. My utmost was I'm serving my

26:36.844 --> 26:39.468
country. If my country wants me to go, I'm going to 
go. That's what my sole purpose was. All right.

26:46.784 --> 26:47.967
What did you feel about the draft? The draft? Well, 
of course, I volunteered for the draft. I was going

26:52.076 --> 26:54.401
to get in, serve my two years, and get out.

26:58.169 --> 26:59.593
The draft I felt like was right. I wish I had the 
draft today. It would help. the younger people

27:03.288 --> 27:10.938
understand a lot more about responsibility, 
dedication about life in general. It teaches you a

27:11.359 --> 27:12.300
lot. I mean, it's helped me in my life now at the age 
of almost 40 years old in what I've learned when I

27:12.380 --> 27:22.373
was in the Army and been drafted. And what I learned 
at that age that I can apply to my life now. And then

27:27.400 --> 27:32.907
when times are tough, times are hard, I can always 
look back at what I did in Vietnam where things

27:27.400 --> 27:32.907
hurt. Extremely tough and related to today, and it 
helped me through a lot of problems. It helped me

27:38.107 --> 27:40.491
through a lot. Okay. What about the people who 
joined the National Guard at this time to get out?

27:46.981 --> 27:48.824
Was that... What, back then? Back then. I never 
knew about it. I really didn't. You know, being 18

27:53.191 --> 27:56.997
years old, the only thing I had in my mind was just 
going in. Okay. Very good. This war was the first,

28:00.427 --> 28:05.435
quote, TV war. Mass media in Vietnam brought the 
war home the next night to the American public. Was

28:12.806 --> 28:16.833
the press and the media involved where you were, or 
did you ever see them?

28:20.378 --> 28:23.363
The only press we had out there I remember was Stars 
and Stripes. You know, they came up to the fire base

28:24.946 --> 28:27.889
and did a story. But they was mainly up there to do a 
story of my brother and I. So did you know about the

28:33.436 --> 28:39.343
media or any problems that it was causing 
elsewhere? Reporters being in? No, because we

28:42.546 --> 28:43.848
never got papers. Where we was at, the only kind of 
communication we had was armed forces radio. If

28:50.174 --> 28:53.877
you're lucky to have a radio, then that's what you 
heard on the news. But you never got a newspaper

28:53.897 --> 28:56.139
telling you what's going on. Never. I'd

28:57.060 --> 29:04.467
like to dig into some of the problems that were 
prevalent during this time. Drugs were a big

29:05.848 --> 29:08.430
problem. Could you elaborate a little bit? Drugs 
was terrible. Drugs was so bad. I think that was the

29:13.595 --> 29:19.540
big cause of our...

29:22.118 --> 29:30.935
As far as our involvement in Vietnam, in the way 
that everybody's attitude was, you know, the way

29:22.118 --> 29:30.935
they looked at the war was drugs. I mean, it tore a 
lot of men up. It tore a lot of young men up. They lost

29:35.524 --> 29:38.390
a lot of lives, too, on the count of drugs. Was it 
just a lack of education about drugs, what they

29:38.811 --> 29:43.941
could do, or why did the men turn to it? Well, I'm 
sure it's lack of education because nobody knew

29:43.921 --> 29:47.249
about drugs. I didn't know what a marijuana 
cigarette was until I went over there. I had no idea

29:50.436 --> 29:52.681
what a marijuana cigarette was. I didn't know what 
a marijuana cigarette was until I was on the way up

29:52.701 --> 30:00.259
to the Central Highlands to meet my brother and I 
got on this helicopter with this other guy from

30:00.695 --> 30:02.317
California. And we was going back, and the fire 
base was getting attacked at the time. So they had

30:07.685 --> 30:10.348
to drop us off at this other area. This one guy had a 
marijuana cigarette and said, hey, you want to try

30:10.368 --> 30:13.392
this? And of course, I was John Wayne out of the 
American flag. I said, yeah, I'll try. So that's my

30:18.039 --> 30:20.102
first time I ever knew about drugs. So there was a 
lack of education. Nobody knew about it, how to

30:22.044 --> 30:25.669
approach it, how to defend it. So drugs are just so 
rampant. You've been 18, 19, 20-year-olds. They

30:30.412 --> 30:33.697
didn't know how to cope with it. Okay. Was 
marijuana the main drug that was being used, or was

30:34.618 --> 30:38.584
there others? Well, it's hard to say. I say all of it 
was, yeah, all of it, you know. Marijuana was easy

30:43.290 --> 30:46.775
to get to, but all of it was so easy to get to. Yeah, so 
easy. Was there a period during the war where drug

30:48.718 --> 30:56.629
use made a drastic, or the use of drugs increased a 
significant amount, or could you tell? Yes. I

30:57.850 --> 31:01.454
would say it did because it went from marijuana to 
the hard stuff. Soon it was opium. Soon all your

31:03.536 --> 31:08.101
marijuana was dusted with opium and things like 
that. So it progressed later on. Sure,

31:10.003 --> 31:11.145
eventually. Sometime around after Tet, you 
notice the problems increasing or? Yeah, the

31:18.032 --> 31:24.760
drugs were bad then because Tet put so much 
pressure and there was so much tension and stress

31:18.032 --> 31:24.760
on you. And sometimes you went two, three, four 
days without sleep. Yeah, drugs were real bad

31:28.242 --> 31:30.847
then. Everybody would do uppers, they'd do 
anything to speed themselves up to get them going

31:31.127 --> 31:36.438
and things like that because you couldn't sleep.

31:40.766 --> 31:42.269
Discipline was another problem. And you've told 
me before that the men didn't listen to the

31:42.289 --> 31:46.116
officers. Do you think there should have been a 
stronger discipline during this time if we could

31:46.805 --> 31:55.738
have performed better with stricter discipline 
in the field? Well, they tried that, and it didn't

31:56.219 --> 31:58.062
work. The only thing they got was the fact that the 
officers wanted to kill the

31:58.462 --> 32:05.573
soldiers. The GIs wanted to kill the officers 
because if they came up there and tried to do this

32:06.110 --> 32:18.146
very strict discipline, like on a fire support 
base where we was at, everything's so lax. You

32:18.786 --> 32:20.088
didn't worry about haircuts. You didn't worry 
about baths. You didn't worry about your boots.

32:23.352 --> 32:25.375
You didn't care about nothing. And then when there 
was a low on the fighting, and this is an example

32:25.395 --> 32:32.704
where we got this one captain up there named 
Captain Fink. I never will forget his name. And he

32:34.645 --> 32:43.036
came up and tried that and brought up all the shoe 
polish and ordered everybody to polish their

32:34.645 --> 32:43.036
boots. Because that was the first sign of having 
discipline on this fire support base. Well, it

32:48.804 --> 32:50.347
didn't work. Everybody got their shoe polish and 
threw it over the perimeter of the barbed wires.

32:55.413 --> 32:56.675
Threw it. That night they tried to kill him. That 
next day, he was out. So it didn't work. Was

33:03.788 --> 33:06.211
fragging a big problem? Yeah. They tried to kill 
them. If they didn't like them, they tried to kill

33:09.575 --> 33:12.639
them. All right. The problem with the officers, 
let's say, what would you look for in an officer

33:14.422 --> 33:25.456
that would come up to your fire support base?

33:25.476 --> 33:28.920
That the officer didn't come up and try to push 
everything down our throat. That everybody

33:29.861 --> 33:32.665
wouldn't be left alone. If there was a fire mission 
that had to be taken care of, then everybody got up

33:33.708 --> 33:39.874
there and did their job. But they didn't want to be 
pushed around and made to do things like they did in

33:39.894 --> 33:51.944
the rear or the main base camp or headquarters 
battalion and how they were treated. We didn't

33:52.445 --> 33:54.026
want to be treated the same way. We wanted to be 
treated separate from all those people because we

33:54.587 --> 34:00.792
felt like we was out there. We was doing it. And we 
want to be left alone. Job called, forced to do our

34:04.471 --> 34:08.977
job, we'd get up and do it. But don't mess with 
nobody. Just leave us alone. And that was added to.

34:13.203 --> 34:15.647
Thank you.

34:19.452 --> 34:21.395
You mentioned earlier that there was different 
groups. When things were lax, that the blacks

34:23.017 --> 34:27.583
would segregate off. You'd have the northerners, 
the southerners, the whites, the druggies, and

34:28.244 --> 34:32.250
the alcoholics. Was there a bad problem with the 
racism, I mean pure hatred, amongst the whites and

34:33.462 --> 34:39.789
blacks? Up there on the fire base there wasn't. You 
know, we just knew where they were coming from and

34:43.273 --> 34:51.221
they knew where we was coming from, but there was no 
bad hatred among us. But you could tell that

34:52.062 --> 34:56.727
they're, you know, you leave us alone, we'll leave 
you alone. And that was the type of attitude. But

34:57.989 --> 35:02.153
still, when it came to working together, it all 
worked well. It was all mixed well, but once

35:02.352 --> 35:09.321
everything was over, then everybody crawled back 
in a little hole, and that's the way it was. Man, you

35:10.302 --> 35:11.504
left each other alone. You didn't bother each 
other. Is that the same basic sentiment in the rear

35:13.927 --> 35:16.530
also? Yeah. Where it's getting worse. Yeah. Yeah, 
in the rear, I would say that racism was worse in the

35:19.173 --> 35:24.360
rear because, you know, they... The things that 
they had to go through back there was just like

35:25.218 --> 35:28.701
stateside duty. So racism was definitely worse in 
the rear than it was in the field because you knew

35:30.803 --> 35:38.891
that you had to depend on each other out there in the 
field. Where back there they didn't.

35:42.955 --> 35:45.737
All right. Did you feel that the potential of the 
American Army was being held back? Because y'all

35:51.002 --> 35:52.744
felt y'all could have done more. We could have 
kicked their ass easy, pure and simple. We could

35:57.397 --> 35:59.680
have kicked their ass. Man, we could have ran them 
out all the way out of Vietnam, north and south,

35:59.700 --> 36:06.732
easy, you betcha. And that was part of it, too. 
Everybody knew that we could have gone out there

36:08.995 --> 36:11.880
and kicked everybody's ass. They came into it. We 
could have kicked them off, but they wouldn't let

36:13.159 --> 36:15.723
us do it. We had certain restrictions. You 
couldn't fire too far this way. You couldn't fire

36:19.669 --> 36:22.253
too far this way, but you could fire this way. So 
there were so many restrictions where everybody

36:22.713 --> 36:27.080
just said, the hell with you. But we could have 
kicked them all the way out, man. There ain't no

36:29.223 --> 36:30.424
doubt in my mind. And any Vietnam veteran would 
tell you that. I thought it was the rules of this

36:33.329 --> 36:38.516
particular war that seemed to hold us back. Right, 
it was rules. Rules are set, and you couldn't break

36:40.497 --> 36:44.343
them. Every now and then they were broke, but you 
had to hide it from the American public in order to

36:44.904 --> 36:54.238
break that rule.

36:56.001 --> 36:59.887
If I could get back into the press and the American 
public seeing this back at home, what we were

36:56.001 --> 36:59.887
doing. Right, it was bad PR. I mean, this was war. It 
was war. I don't see where you can have this. That's

37:09.743 --> 37:10.224
right. That's why, Satan, you just said that. It's 
hard to believe, but we thought the same thing. Why

37:17.473 --> 37:18.595
can we have rules? Why are there rules? So 
everybody, of course, you don't get an answer. You

37:24.783 --> 37:26.485
just do what you're supposed to do. Okay. You think 
we could have won this war? Ain't no doubt in my

37:31.498 --> 37:32.499
mind. Like I just said just a minute ago, we could 
have kicked them all the way out. We could have

37:36.706 --> 37:38.148
kicked them all the way out. What would you have 
done different? What I could have done different?

37:46.000 --> 37:48.404
On a whole, if you were looking at the war 
yourself... Oh, war. And what, from your

37:48.945 --> 37:52.270
experiences...

37:54.663 --> 37:59.848
Basically, when you go into a war, you declare it as 
a war, you go in and you kick your butts. You have an

38:01.850 --> 38:11.820
objective, you go in with that objective, you 
conquer that objective, and you've done your job.

38:12.160 --> 38:14.062
That's what I see about it. If they would come up 
tomorrow and say, all Vietnam veterans, you can

38:14.082 --> 38:19.708
come back to South Vietnam, And you can get over 
there and kick their butts any way you want to, in

38:20.009 --> 38:25.375
any direction, have at it. Maybe we'd load up and 
we'd kick their ass. So you'd go back and drop a hat?

38:32.202 --> 38:36.306
I'd go back, damn right I would. When you came home, 
what was American sentiment towards you? Were you

38:43.394 --> 38:48.620
treated bad?

38:48.640 --> 38:49.020
Well, As soon as you came home, the first thing they 
did to you on the airplane was they stuck you off on

38:49.878 --> 38:59.080
the end of a runway.

39:01.766 --> 39:04.413
And you had to sit there for three hours at the end of 
the runway. They never explained to you why. And

39:08.727 --> 39:14.193
you just sit there, you sat there for three hours, 
you couldn't understand, why are we just sitting

39:08.727 --> 39:14.193
here for three hours? Well, once they get you off 
the airplane, they bring you into the reception

39:14.994 --> 39:24.804
center, and I'm talking about Fort Lewis, 
Washington.

39:26.145 --> 39:33.233
They set you down in a room, and they, and they talk 
to you, and they, what, deprogram, or I forgot what

39:34.040 --> 39:38.727
the terminology was for what they did to you. But 
they deep programmed you, so to speak.

39:43.393 --> 39:45.176
And all you want to do is just get in and get out. 
Well, they did that for about an hour. And then

39:48.360 --> 39:54.869
inside of another hour and a half, two hours, they 
give you a T-bone steak if you wanted it. And then

39:55.330 --> 39:57.413
your airplane takes you back home. Once you got to 
the airport, the sentiments were so bad and

39:57.433 --> 40:03.962
negative that it

40:07.705 --> 40:12.352
There at the bar, I remember this one bar where I 
came in, the first thing I did was order me a drink. I

40:12.432 --> 40:16.038
turned to this guy, I said, man, I'm just back home 
from Nam, and he looked at me and said, so what? So,

40:16.879 --> 40:19.062
you know, that was my first impression coming 
back. And I remember when I was going to Vietnam, I

40:20.725 --> 40:26.714
was going to Fort Lewis, Washington, to go to 
Vietnam, and I was on this airplane. And the

40:28.176 --> 40:29.899
stewardess wouldn't even serve me. She wouldn't 
serve me food because I was going to Vietnam. And so

40:34.469 --> 40:38.334
the stewardess came back, or came up and asked me if 
I was hungry. I said, yes, I am. She said, well, I

40:39.135 --> 40:40.977
came in to get your food. I said, well, she didn't 
ask me. She says, OK. She said, she does this to

40:42.539 --> 40:46.304
Vietnam veterans. She won't serve a Vietnam 
veteran. So that's what you had to encounter.

41:01.603 --> 41:02.805
John, you stated that You moved from the 
engineering battalion up to Central Highlands to

41:03.528 --> 41:07.552
be your brother. How did this come about? How did 
you get to go up there? Well, it's kind of funny.

41:15.321 --> 41:19.826
I've got to go back just a little bit more because my 
brother went in the service corps I did. And I went

41:20.827 --> 41:23.830
in approximately five, six months after he did. 
And they shipped him straight to Vietnam from

41:24.671 --> 41:28.956
artillery school. But when I went in, they sent me 
to Germany. Well, while in Germany, I re-enlisted

41:32.705 --> 41:36.849
three years in the Army to go to Vietnam. So when I 
came home, they sent me to Vietnam to the Mekong

41:38.010 --> 41:46.317
Delta, and they shipped my twin brother from 
Vietnam to Germany. So I was in a non-combat role in

41:48.159 --> 41:53.304
South Vietnam in the Delta. And my brother was in 
Germany at the time. Well, he re-enlisted three

41:56.106 --> 42:00.130
more years to go back to Vietnam. So he went back to 
Vietnam, and they sent him up to the Central

42:00.464 --> 42:04.248
Highlands. Well, the time that I was down at the 
Delta, I was very unhappy. I wanted to play a role in

42:09.133 --> 42:12.757
combat. I mean, I wanted to be out there in the bush. 
I mean, I wanted to beat the bush, and I wanted to be

42:15.340 --> 42:19.043
out there. And I had a couple friends in school that 
died that were killed in Vietnam. So I wanted to go

42:25.310 --> 42:30.235
to Vietnam, and I wanted to fight in Vietnam. I 
tried to get out of this engineer unit to be with my

42:30.586 --> 42:43.703
brother, and I went to the inspector general, I 
went to the chaplain, I went through all the

42:30.586 --> 42:43.703
channels that you could possibly go through to get 
out. And it was always revoked by this Captain

42:44.825 --> 42:56.140
Sears, which I won't forget his name, because he 
didn't want me to go, because it looked bad on him if

42:44.825 --> 42:56.140
a man transferred out of your unit. It looked bad. 
Well, All the channels that I went through fell.

43:02.723 --> 43:06.587
And I was at a bar one night, and I was talking to this 
black GI. He was an E6 in personnel. And we was

43:09.370 --> 43:12.252
talking, and I was talking about my dilemma, why I 
was down. And he said, listen, man, I'm in

43:12.793 --> 43:14.675
personnel. I'll help you get out. Now, this is 
another sign of how the Army works, you know. And an

43:21.641 --> 43:25.365
E6, this guy got me out inside of three days. Got the 
paperwork, got it approved, and everything. Got

43:28.403 --> 43:34.614
me out in three days, and I went up to Central 
Highlands with my brother, where we was up there

43:28.403 --> 43:34.614
together. As far as I know, I think we're the only 20 
that was together in Vietnam. Did y'all go on

43:39.362 --> 43:41.025
operations together? No, we always went 
separate. Always went separate. Yeah, right. The

43:43.670 --> 43:45.874
first sergeant insisted that we went separate. Of 
course, we agreed to go separate. We never went on

43:47.957 --> 43:49.480
the same one. All right, well, John, I appreciate 
it. Okay. I hope your answers and everything can

43:54.574 --> 43:59.440
help some other people understand kind of what 
went on. I'd like to give a little brief summary

43:59.901 --> 44:06.188
here that I'd like to say thank you very much for 
asking these questions. This is the first time

44:06.228 --> 44:21.627
that I've ever been asked questions of this sort, 
and it feels good to be asked these questions, and I

44:06.228 --> 44:21.627
hope that in some way that my answers can help the 
younger people that are going to come up in your day

44:22.349 --> 44:27.857
and behind you that can help understand what we 
went through. There's a lot more that you just

44:27.877 --> 44:32.563
can't express in 45 minutes. There's a lot more 
that needs to be said to

44:33.064 --> 44:42.137
the people to let them know what we went through. 
But I do want to say thank you very much for coming up

44:44.040 --> 44:47.925
here and asking me these questions. It feels very 
good, and I want to thank you very much. Appreciate

44:50.289 --> 44:51.010
it, John. Thank you.
