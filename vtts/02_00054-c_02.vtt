WEBVTT

00:04.233 --> 00:15.405
for us to get back is to move Elephant Walk to right before Final Review and make it serious and get that back.

00:16.025 --> 00:18.768
And they've started trying to do that a few years back and they have made it better.

00:24.855 --> 00:28.639
Get rid of the word zip, dead, dead, that.

00:28.779 --> 00:29.399
Do away with it.

00:29.479 --> 00:32.923
Do away with, beat the hell out of it.

00:37.038 --> 00:46.649
to be in every outfit and give them an outfit of their own and maybe have one outfit that's 50-50 for those guys who want to be in a girl's outfit and those girls who want to be in a guy.

00:47.050 --> 00:52.196
That is true diversity which seems to be the major word on this campus this day.

00:52.236 --> 00:59.585
So there's some things like that that are little steps that could be taken tomorrow and return bonfire and let them cut.

00:59.985 --> 01:06.353
Those four or five things right there would make a tremendous difference on this campus and I think you'd start hearing howdy again.

01:06.907 --> 01:10.971
because of what occurs in those when we start taking things serious.

01:11.492 --> 01:21.703
It's easy to go downhill and become like everybody else and there are some who would love for us to right here on this campus and some of your fellow administrators and faculty members I'm afraid.

01:23.145 --> 01:25.107
It's okay if you don't have me preaching.

01:25.688 --> 01:26.268
Commencement.

01:28.791 --> 01:29.752
Recall commencement.

01:29.792 --> 01:31.834
Why is A&M commencement so special?

01:33.056 --> 01:35.158
Well mainly because we have,

01:35.847 --> 01:43.694
forever provided so many officers into our military services to help protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.

01:44.155 --> 01:51.682
And we're the largest producer of officers outside the military academies in the country.

01:52.383 --> 01:59.870
In fact, in World War II, we produced more officers for War II than even the military academies or any other school.

01:59.890 --> 02:04.234
So the fact that our history has always been servants

02:04.568 --> 02:09.093
serving, giving, going the extra mile, doing what it takes.

02:09.954 --> 02:17.824
And therefore, commencement for those who are getting ready to go and serve their country unselfishly is a very important event.

02:18.805 --> 02:32.922
I remember at mine, I had on my Air Force blues and one of the underclassmen cadets, I'd just taken off my boots and Aggie uniform for the last time, put on those blues.

02:33.138 --> 02:36.562
They were saying something about how sharp it looked in those blues and the same.

02:37.423 --> 02:40.827
I said, but not like the senior boots.

02:40.847 --> 02:53.983
So yes, it is a special time and important time for us to... Is there something special at commencement when, as they hand you the diploma, every name is called, every hand is shaken?

02:55.124 --> 02:56.706
Is that something special at A&M?

02:57.427 --> 02:59.449
Oh, yes.

02:59.429 --> 03:01.151
I'm sorry, you were talking about commencement.

03:01.211 --> 03:02.753
I was talking about commissioning.

03:02.773 --> 03:03.394
No, no, no.

03:03.414 --> 03:03.695
Yeah, exactly.

03:03.715 --> 03:04.736
I was talking about commissioning.

03:05.657 --> 03:06.518
Commencement, yes.

03:07.139 --> 03:08.040
Well, it is.

03:08.301 --> 03:10.103
Here, congratulations.

03:10.183 --> 03:12.546
You have completed the task.

03:12.586 --> 03:13.848
You're on your road.

03:13.908 --> 03:14.949
You're on a new journey.

03:14.989 --> 03:21.538
You're still climbing the mountain, but you've taken the first steps and the necessary steps, and this is our telling you.

03:32.352 --> 03:35.096
But it is a special time there for the last time.

03:35.296 --> 03:42.808
As you were getting ready to leave the campus as a new graduate, how well prepared did you feel A&M had made you?

03:43.809 --> 03:52.322
Well, very well prepared in many areas and could have more if I had been a better student from the academic standpoint.

03:52.362 --> 03:53.524
I could have done much more.

03:53.544 --> 03:54.686
That's nobody's fault but my own.

03:55.287 --> 03:57.550
But what I got

04:02.288 --> 04:10.624
throughout the years, since 1961, beginning for over 40 years, are those things that made America strong.

04:10.644 --> 04:16.074
A&M, again, it's about your character.

04:16.796 --> 04:17.838
It's about behavior.

04:18.158 --> 04:19.661
It is that other education.

04:20.443 --> 04:23.689
You can go to any school and pretty much get a pretty good education

04:35.330 --> 04:44.664
traits that are necessary that'll stay with you for your lifetime, and those being consequences for your actions, which we don't see much of in America, whether you're talking about O.J.

04:44.744 --> 04:47.468
or President Clinton or many other people.

04:47.749 --> 05:03.312
And right here on campus, we've become more slack in consequences for your actions, and I hate to see that, but having those basic principles of life that'll carry on throughout your life, really many of them Christian traits,

05:03.713 --> 05:10.562
if you want to be honest about it and tell the whole truth, most of them are based on Christian principles.

05:11.463 --> 05:17.510
And it's not about being politically correct to me at A&M, it's about being plain old correct.

05:17.530 --> 05:19.513
It's not about your gender, it's about your genuineness.

05:19.533 --> 05:30.767
It's not about your standards, the positions you hold, but the positions you take is what really matters at A&M and that's where

05:36.400 --> 05:39.164
going the extra mile, the golden rule.

05:39.605 --> 05:44.472
Those are the traits of helping your fellow man, of being unselfish.

05:45.193 --> 06:03.220
Those are the traits that's gonna make America great, continue to be great, and if we ever lose those, and we start focusing on self, what's in it for me, me, me, we're falling down the primrose path that has led many others down the wrong road, and it's a broad road.

06:03.720 --> 06:04.922
So staying on the narrow road,

06:05.560 --> 06:10.166
It's what I hope we do at A&M and never forget where we came from and our roots.

06:10.327 --> 06:12.770
Tradition is important.

06:12.810 --> 06:15.854
We're getting near the end of the questions that I have thought of.

06:17.677 --> 06:26.809
You've mentioned part of this already, but the question is, if you were a consultant to the A&M leadership today,

06:27.143 --> 06:32.290
what advice would you give them about guiding A&M to even greater success in the future?

06:32.751 --> 06:36.856
In addition to what you've already, any other suggestions you'd make to them?

06:36.916 --> 06:41.763
Yes, and this will probably keep me from ever getting a job at Texas A&M.

06:41.783 --> 06:47.070
But scrap a large part of Vision 2020.

06:49.433 --> 06:51.216
Don't try to be everything to everybody.

06:52.077 --> 06:56.543
We've got some great music schools

06:57.265 --> 06:57.906
in Texas.

06:58.487 --> 07:02.913
We don't need another one just to satisfy a few people.

07:03.314 --> 07:15.251
Do not be ashamed of the ag image of Texas A&M, of the farm boy down to earth, blue jean, boots, hard working.

07:15.872 --> 07:20.378
Do not be ashamed of the military and the Corps of Cadets at A&M.

07:21.019 --> 07:25.365
Do not try to become like TU, Harvard, Yale,

07:26.645 --> 07:32.015
We can be great academically for quit using the word becoming world class.

07:32.736 --> 07:35.702
I personally have always felt like we've been heavenly class.

07:36.203 --> 07:39.128
Why should we want to go down to being world class?

07:39.749 --> 07:45.921
And most of that has to do with character, behaviors, what kind of people we bring in here.

07:46.722 --> 07:50.509
And it's so hard in a university to

07:51.029 --> 07:52.471
to be conservative.

07:52.571 --> 08:15.079
I know the tendency is for faculty, it just draws those kind of people that are liberal and have this ideology of everything draws in you're okay and I'm okay and whatever you want to do is fine and if it feels good do it and do your own thing and that all came from the 60s and it's killed us and we need to stay away from that

08:15.312 --> 08:19.079
And we start talking about being a giver, not a taker.

08:19.419 --> 08:29.698
I tell my friends, if we'd put about $50 million into the fine arts here, we could become as good as North Texas was 30, 40 years ago.

08:29.718 --> 08:31.060
Exactly.

08:31.040 --> 08:38.447
See, the fine arts costs more to teach than any other subject except human medicine.

08:38.467 --> 08:39.328
Is that right?

08:39.348 --> 08:41.029
Yeah, because you see, it's one-on-one.

08:41.950 --> 08:47.575
Think how much the materials cost, the instruments and all that.

08:47.735 --> 08:48.596
That's a good point.

08:48.616 --> 08:49.937
I hadn't thought of that standpoint.

08:50.758 --> 08:57.344
So we need to be careful about not, there's more to it than just getting the top 10% of those who make $1,500 on the SAT.

08:57.804 --> 09:00.827
I'd not really have somebody that's well-rounded and has character.

09:01.297 --> 09:01.938
and it's proven it.

09:01.978 --> 09:03.120
And there's ways to dig that.

09:03.280 --> 09:04.161
Is it hard to do?

09:04.522 --> 09:08.488
Weed out, yes, but people that want to be aged.

09:09.349 --> 09:19.184
If somebody made it possible for you to pass a million dollars onto A&M, somebody gives you a check and says, here, got to give it to them.

09:19.204 --> 09:23.190
If you could make a major gift to A&M, for what purpose would you want that gift used?

09:23.791 --> 09:30.561
Okay, well, you know, this might, because of America, the way we've become, it might not even be allowed, but I would,

09:30.878 --> 09:43.595
I am so pleased that we have a breakaway, that we have on a state campus five to seven thousand kids that will go to a Bible study on their own on a Tuesday night.

09:44.316 --> 09:49.783
Now, that's what I personally would like to give it to, whether the school can do that or not, but if not, the Corps of Cadets.

09:50.464 --> 09:53.148
I would put it back into the Corps.

09:53.168 --> 09:56.532
And what would you have the Corps do with it?

09:57.119 --> 10:02.544
leadership and behavior character training, because much as I love the Corps, there's a lot wrong with the Corps.

10:02.884 --> 10:06.748
And just because you're in the Corps doesn't mean that you're the best Aggie there is.

10:06.888 --> 10:08.430
I'm smarter than that.

10:08.530 --> 10:15.516
I know there are a lot of non-reg civilian students on A&M that are better Aggies than some cadets.

10:16.117 --> 10:23.464
But still, that's still the foundation that we've got to keep strong, that who'll play taps

10:24.237 --> 10:25.779
Who'll carry the flags?

10:25.799 --> 10:26.920
Who'll raise the flags?

10:26.960 --> 10:28.722
Who'll go to the corps trips?

10:28.742 --> 10:31.645
Who'll play the war hand?

10:31.685 --> 10:33.247
Who'll go the extra mile?

10:33.267 --> 10:35.649
You know, I have a strong feel for the corps.

10:35.950 --> 10:37.852
And I love these other students too.

10:37.872 --> 10:40.695
I mean, I hope you understand I'm not liking anybody.

10:40.715 --> 10:50.245
To what A&M former students, teachers, advisors, administrators do you feel most grateful for?

11:01.953 --> 11:11.487
The people that I really look up to are people like Gene Stallings, Shelby Metcalfe.

11:13.510 --> 11:14.231
I like them.

11:15.933 --> 11:23.384
And this will rankle some people, but I like Jackie Sherrill because Jackie Sherrill caught on to what A&M was about.

11:24.966 --> 11:28.551
Media hated him, all of our opponents hated him, but he loved A&M.

11:29.172 --> 11:31.255
Right or wrong, I don't know how he treated the faculty.

11:31.336 --> 11:36.665
I don't know about what he did right or wrong with recruiting and all that, but I'll say this.

11:37.326 --> 11:38.107
He caught on.

11:38.167 --> 11:39.149
He was on the stack.

11:39.169 --> 11:40.631
He worked on bonfire.

11:40.651 --> 11:42.074
He started the towel raving.

11:42.114 --> 11:44.618
He started the 12th man kickoff team.

11:44.638 --> 11:47.603
That was big time stuff, and students responded.

11:47.643 --> 11:55.416
I'll never forget that ball game here against the Cubs when we beat them 42 to 10 or something, and I had never heard the student body

11:56.830 --> 12:08.844
It was great and so I'd like to see that type of spirit return where we're talking about good stuff instead of constantly talking about bad stuff.

12:11.947 --> 12:13.209
What was your question again?

12:13.229 --> 12:19.897
Oh yeah, of course Earl Rudder, you know, that can you not include him in that as far as we're talking about individuals.

12:20.577 --> 12:24.542
But the core, the upperclassmen that taught me so much, my outfit,

12:25.670 --> 12:32.961
my yellator buddies, all of that that we went through, all of those people.

12:32.981 --> 12:34.563
Just mostly the common people.

12:34.623 --> 12:40.612
Pinky, people I call common people, you know, that aren't necessarily the big time money givers.

12:41.253 --> 12:42.514
I don't know a lot of them.

12:42.534 --> 12:47.762
Great people, I appreciate what they do, but a lot of them haven't necessarily touched me.

12:48.721 --> 12:56.569
All right, this next question is, I just realized I hadn't asked you earlier, and it's comparatively unimportant, and then I've got the last.

12:57.570 --> 13:02.636
When you were around as a student, did you know about the existence of any secret fraternities?

13:03.637 --> 13:04.218
I did not.

13:04.678 --> 13:12.426
I had never heard of anything secret until 1998 when my daughter was here.

13:13.748 --> 13:14.288
My daughter.

13:14.489 --> 13:17.732
And she said, Dad, did you know anything

13:18.286 --> 13:22.833
about a group called Strikers or, is that the name?

13:22.854 --> 13:23.775
Strikers or Streaker?

13:23.795 --> 13:25.217
Do you know what I'm talking about?

13:25.237 --> 13:27.862
The TTs and the Stickers.

13:28.062 --> 13:28.543
Stickers.

13:28.683 --> 13:29.124
Stickers.

13:29.204 --> 13:29.725
Yeah, that's it.

13:29.805 --> 13:30.606
I said Strikers.

13:31.167 --> 13:32.049
And the last question.

13:33.551 --> 13:38.099
What feelings do you carry in your heart today for Texas A&M?

13:39.701 --> 13:41.965
Well, tremendous.

13:48.087 --> 13:57.975
I would be amiss if I didn't say that my central focus is serving my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.

13:59.597 --> 14:04.881
But a big portion of that, I don't have to separate A&M from that.

14:05.101 --> 14:17.672
I'm not saying that everybody at A&M is Christian by any means, but I'm just saying that many of the principles that A&M is based on, whether people like to hear it or it's politically correct or not,

14:18.074 --> 14:21.599
The fact remains, they're based on Christian principles.

14:22.280 --> 14:23.742
You just can't get away from it.

14:23.862 --> 14:25.505
It's over our building doors.

14:26.506 --> 14:36.901
It's those people that start muster, that start silver taps, that start these service, all these great service things that the kids do and big event day.

14:37.201 --> 14:38.002
That's giving.

14:38.062 --> 14:40.586
Giving comes from a Christ-like spirit.

14:41.467 --> 14:43.390
Everybody might not give that to Christ,

14:46.711 --> 14:59.011
And that's where, at Texas A&M, I owe a lot of my, not only my Christian life and behavior and character, but a lot of it was developed here.

14:59.391 --> 15:04.279
It started earlier in my life with my parents, but it matured here in many ways.

15:05.902 --> 15:12.212
And the love of my fellow classmates and my core buddies

15:12.698 --> 15:15.562
are the ones who will carry me to my grave.

15:15.622 --> 15:17.405
They're the ones that were in my wedding.

15:18.026 --> 15:20.128
They're the ones I look forward to seeing.

15:20.149 --> 15:23.393
They're the reason that I moved back to Texas A&M.

15:23.533 --> 15:28.060
It's because of the great experiences that I've had here.

15:28.360 --> 15:38.755
And I'm hoping to be a part of continuing those things that are great to ensure that these students today have a lot of those same experiences.

15:38.835 --> 15:41.158
I have people telling me, well, they're different today.

15:41.178 --> 15:42.520
You don't understand.

15:43.090 --> 15:48.076
living in the past, and I tell them no, things that matter are the same.

15:48.677 --> 15:59.610
Character, devotion, duty, honor, country, faith, love, giving, all of those things, that's what they're hungry for.

16:00.551 --> 16:01.952
And that's what we can give them.

16:01.972 --> 16:05.657
The A&M can develop you physically, mentally, and spiritually.

16:06.878 --> 16:10.903
And I'm so glad that we're a university that does that, for the most part, unashamed.

16:13.178 --> 16:15.622
always carry that banner high and we better be careful.

16:16.324 --> 16:19.449
We better be careful because we can go downhill fast.

16:19.710 --> 16:30.048
We better be sober and vigilant in carrying out what A&M was really based on and what has made me love A&M so, Aggieland, why I love her so.

16:30.910 --> 16:31.491
That's great.
