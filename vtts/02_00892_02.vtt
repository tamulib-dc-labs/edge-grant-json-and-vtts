WEBVTT

00:01.769 --> 00:05.813
window washing, grounds keeping, et cetera. And 
they've shown a tremendous commitment to even

00:06.714 --> 00:17.566
keep us, keep the planning program and the 
Institute of Urban Studies. So it's both positive

00:18.928 --> 00:21.871
and negative. It's been positive and negative for 
the last five years here. And any of the negatives

00:26.596 --> 00:31.742
that I mentioned about planning at UT Arlington, 
might be able to be viewed in that context.

00:38.356 --> 00:50.488
From another perspective, we've accomplished a 
lot of interesting things in the planning program

00:38.356 --> 00:50.488
in the dozen years. We've increased our 
enrollment steadily. We're quite respectable in

00:56.974 --> 00:59.957
our numbers now. as far as students go. We've

01:03.834 --> 01:10.342
increased our visibility statewide in planning. 
We are well looked upon, the planning program, in

01:12.165 --> 01:19.254
the Dallas-Fort Worth area from the governments. 
Whenever I meet with the city, there's interest in

01:19.734 --> 01:25.622
what's going on. The section's proud to have us 
here, APA Texas section. And generally, we're

01:31.443 --> 01:35.469
well supported. Our graduates have some 
interesting jobs. One of them works for the city of

01:39.175 --> 01:45.084
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania housing agency. 
Another one works as a regional planner for Lake

01:45.805 --> 01:53.296
Tahoe, Reno area. One of them is planning director 
of Garland, Texas. Another one's planning

01:58.744 --> 02:00.707
director of Mansfield. They're out there. One is 
with the consulting urban redevelopment firm.

02:09.947 --> 02:10.768
And on and on. They're very practical people. They 
come out of here very practical and well thought

02:15.634 --> 02:19.299
of. The materials

02:20.821 --> 02:29.952
have been good. the university has supported us in 
computer hardware and software and in books and

02:30.995 --> 02:39.790
supplies. There's been no lack of that. I guess 
they took all our salary money and put it into that.

02:47.183 --> 02:54.336
So I

02:47.183 --> 02:54.336
would say that there's There has been a series of 
successes. There has been a series of failures

02:59.900 --> 03:05.507
that have occurred. And the biggest problem with 
planning at UT Arlington from an academic

03:06.308 --> 03:23.428
perspective is with four years in the School of 
Architecture under an architectural dean that

03:06.308 --> 03:23.428
had little understanding of planning, two being 
moved after four years as a new program, to two

03:24.033 --> 03:37.948
years under the graduate dean who had no other 
academic programs under his tutelage on campus,

03:24.033 --> 03:37.948
and then to be moved to the Institute of Urban 
Studies. To begin again, every time it set the

03:39.710 --> 03:48.279
planning program back as far as enrollments went, 
as far as developing went. It was almost a new

03:49.060 --> 03:51.002
ballgame each time. So in my opinion, the planning 
program at UT Arlington started three times.

03:58.464 --> 04:00.327
Good point. And there's a certain amount of just 
getting used to the new territory that the faculty

04:00.347 --> 04:06.938
would have to go through. That is correct. And of 
course, then you have the nuisance of changing

04:10.383 --> 04:15.111
your stationery all the time. That's correct. 
Which is the least of your problems, I'm sure. And

04:18.421 --> 04:24.948
in a way, we've been moved now to an academic unit 
that is a troubled unit. This academic unit is not

04:24.968 --> 04:31.415
within the budget of the university. It's a line 
item of the governor's budget. It's the

04:34.558 --> 04:36.720
Department of Urban Studies. So we are funded as a 
separate tail item. So at any time we are

04:42.586 --> 04:44.108
threatened, in some budget-cutting legislative 
session. We could be gone, so we live under the gun.

04:50.762 --> 04:52.123
Yeah, you're very vulnerable. Very vulnerable 
and not a pleasant position. Whereas the other two

04:56.929 --> 05:02.075
places, we were financially safe and sound. And 
that's just my opinion. Do you think this will

05:05.419 --> 05:06.681
change?

05:11.046 --> 05:13.369
It's very... very much a concern to all the faculty 
in the Institute of Urban Studies what the

05:14.024 --> 05:20.852
legislature does every time it meets every two 
years. Now there's a bill on the floor for them to

05:22.634 --> 05:29.462
meet every year, which would double your anxiety. 
That's correct. That's correct.

05:36.350 --> 05:41.095
And then, of course, the institute, being a line 
item, subject to a red pencil by the governor would

05:41.581 --> 05:45.965
include the planning program. I believe so.

05:51.871 --> 05:55.835
Well, I can only wish you well under those 
conditions.

05:58.338 --> 06:10.170
Maybe what you need is a new dean like we're getting 
at Texas A&M who brings with him as part of his

05:58.338 --> 06:10.170
agreement to become dean a very strong financial 
commitment from the institution. He started out

06:12.597 --> 06:20.584
with $3.5 million for remodeling the building, 
which is only 10 years old, by the way. And we will

06:21.805 --> 06:27.430
need to see just how much more he brings with him. He 
accepted the position with the understanding

06:27.811 --> 06:37.980
that the administration intends it to be a 
first-rank college within the United States. So

06:39.665 --> 06:41.287
we'll have to see what happens. I frankly think he 
can do it, if he's given the resources that he's

06:41.727 --> 06:47.274
been promised. I think he probably could. I wish 
Arlington the same kind of good luck. Any other

06:59.209 --> 07:00.390
points?

07:10.293 --> 07:14.798
I think the city manager form of government is bad 
for Texas. This may seem heresy. The city manager

07:17.020 --> 07:39.625
form of government views planning as, in this 
metropolitan area, they view planning as

07:17.020 --> 07:39.625
subservient

07:17.020 --> 07:39.625
to their office of being coordinator and they 
frequently override planners'

07:17.020 --> 07:39.625
recommendations. So as far as being an effective 
form of government to create urban change for the

07:41.107 --> 07:49.960
future, it doesn't. It's reactive to business 
interests and resident interests. So it becomes

07:55.968 --> 08:00.495
reactive as opposed to proactive. Planning must 
be proactive. There is an institutional conflict

08:03.199 --> 08:08.346
there between planning and city manager form of 
government. You'd rather see a strong mayor type?

08:11.792 --> 08:12.633
Yes, indeed. Yes, indeed. That's what El Paso has, 
and it has worked quite well there, because what

08:15.476 --> 08:32.291
that has done, in the case of John Cunningham, was 
to put him in the position of being a de facto city

08:15.476 --> 08:32.291
manager, as well as planning director. Now, under 
I don't mean even... And as to Valencia, we'll have

08:37.891 --> 08:45.884
to see what role planning has to play under a new 
personality.

08:49.289 --> 09:03.291
Well, I think that the result of planning history, 
the result of any kind of planning history, is

08:49.289 --> 09:03.291
where is it now, where has it been in relation to 
that. I think planning has had its difficulty in

09:03.980 --> 09:08.285
non-traditions due to the structure of 
government. That an effective business manager,

09:10.108 --> 09:22.443
that is a city manager,

09:10.108 --> 09:22.443
is bottom line results dollar oriented. Short 
term. Which means short term. Immediate. Right.

09:27.730 --> 09:29.051
And that is not long term. And they run out of 
patience with people who think in long range

09:33.038 --> 09:35.361
terms. Because they have short term deadlines to 
make. So planning in north central Texas, I think

09:41.509 --> 09:50.540
the great future is an environmental movement, 
environmental planning. Because the pressure

09:50.560 --> 09:55.026
can be brought to bear to force planning to occur or 
people will die. Or there'll be no place for the

09:57.248 --> 09:59.431
garbage. Right.

10:02.992 --> 10:04.110
Thank you very much, Joel. I appreciate it.

12:43.473 --> 12:44.287
Bye.

13:41.303 --> 13:44.243
I guess that could work.

14:19.373 --> 14:22.718
Just love your Lord.
