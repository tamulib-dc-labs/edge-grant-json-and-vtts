WEBVTT

00:03.372 --> 00:31.287
When we entered

00:03.372 --> 00:31.287
the space program in the essentially early days of 
NASA's development, what differences do you see

00:03.372 --> 00:31.287
between then and now in terms of NASA's ideology 
and purpose? Well, the actual purpose of NASA

00:33.308 --> 00:38.415
really hasn't changed. It's a research and 
development organization, and as you may be

00:38.435 --> 01:01.088
aware, it grew out of the NACA, or NACA, which is the 
National Aeronautics Council, something

00:38.435 --> 01:01.088
that transitioned from NACA to NASA was 
occasioned by the Space Act of 1958, which in turn

01:01.979 --> 01:13.178
was at least in part triggered by the success of the 
Soviet space program. And from that time on,

01:13.198 --> 01:23.937
basically NASA has undertaken in the space arena 
to advance the state of technology and science,

01:24.406 --> 01:37.920
and to carry out the mission for the space missions 
that have been deemed most appropriate by the

01:24.406 --> 01:37.920
President and other administrations including 
the Congress. And of course we, following

01:37.940 --> 01:51.274
President Kennedy's commitment to put a man on the 
moon before the end of the decade of the 60s,

01:37.940 --> 01:51.274
put the bulk of our resources into that effort. And 
then following the successful conclusion of

01:52.250 --> 02:12.317
that, it had become obviously obvious to a lot of 
people within NASA and presumably many people in

01:52.250 --> 02:12.317
the government that the throwaway spacecraft is 
an extravagant luxury and we needed to work on

01:52.250 --> 02:12.317
something that would be reusable many times, in 
turn has evolved into the Shuttle Spacecraft

02:13.090 --> 02:21.662
System, which is more appropriately known as the 
National Space Transportation System. And by

02:22.943 --> 02:40.667
extension, following the realization that the 
Shuttle would in fact be successful, Mr. Reagan

02:22.943 --> 02:40.667
wanted us to concentrate on more immediate 
practical applications of the Shuttle for a year

02:22.943 --> 02:40.667
or two, which was done. And now we've embarked on 
building a permanent unmanned space station to be

02:41.002 --> 02:50.034
operational before the end of the decade. It 
started in 84, I think, before 94 came out.

02:56.643 --> 03:05.575
When NASA was created under Eisenhower in 58, was 
it intended to be a civilian type of organization,

02:56.643 --> 03:05.575
even though its first members were primary 
military? Well, it was chartered. who would

03:08.474 --> 03:23.871
handle the civilian space program of the U.S. And I 
would take issue with your statement that the

03:08.474 --> 03:23.871
first members of the military, because the bulk of 
the agency was and always has been civilian. If you

03:23.891 --> 03:30.518
look at the Project Mercury astronauts, these 
basically were all military. There were only

03:30.538 --> 03:34.482
seven people out of several thousand in the 
agency. And, of course, all of the folks that had

03:35.288 --> 03:51.052
been working for NACA in the aeronautical field, 
that is the airfoil designers, the engine people,

03:35.288 --> 03:51.052
the ones that build and operate the wind tunnels 
and things of that sort, came along with the

03:35.288 --> 03:51.052
agency. And the unmanned space program also grew 
up within NASA, and this was when we were totally

03:51.072 --> 04:00.986
surveying. We probed to Jupiter and Mars, to 
Venus, things like that. So really there's only a

04:06.375 --> 04:18.590
very small percentage of military and those that 
are military working with NASA are basically

04:06.375 --> 04:18.590
following the civilian pursuers in their 
uniform. Do you think that the sexual revolution

04:18.610 --> 04:29.943
of the 70s and the civil rights movement of the 60s 
have affected the attitude of NASA and the

04:18.610 --> 04:29.943
entrance of the minorities into the space 
program? Well, I guess you'd have to say that to the

04:33.592 --> 05:03.531
extent that these things have affected the 
sociology of the United States in general, they

04:33.592 --> 05:03.531
have also affected the sociology of NASA 
specifically, we are finding that

04:33.592 --> 05:03.531
we can now obtain, for example, in the minority, 
racial minority category, racial minorities

04:33.592 --> 05:03.531
that have gained flight training and test pilot 
experience in the military, and are available to

05:04.017 --> 05:18.660
enter into the NASA program were back in the early 
60s, there were not such people anywhere in the

05:04.017 --> 05:18.660
military or in the U.S. social structure. We were 
also finding quite a number of women engineers,

05:18.680 --> 05:32.421
scientists, medical doctors, things of this 
sort, and you're starting to see women as pilots in

05:18.680 --> 05:32.421
the armed forces and flying for the commercial 
airlines. And I would imagine that before too many

05:37.582 --> 05:44.910
years are out, like, we'll have some selected 
pilot category within NASA also. Can you check

05:44.930 --> 05:47.893
this real quick? Yeah, I think that will work. Were 
women and minorities brought in gradually, or as

05:51.837 --> 06:01.007
you said, since there weren't too many in the 60s, 
was there a sudden push to bring them in? There was

06:02.371 --> 06:10.098
not a sudden push, but by the same token, they 
weren't brought in gradually either.

06:15.564 --> 06:30.758
I came into the program in 66, and there was one 
selection of 11 scientists in 67, and we got a few of

06:15.564 --> 06:30.758
the NOL, the Mandorbin Laboratory guys, when 
their program was canceled. But basically,

06:33.909 --> 06:46.541
between 1967 and 1978, 11 years, there were no new 
inputs into the astronaut corps. And what

06:46.561 --> 06:58.552
happened in 1978, we selected a total of 30 people, 
as they would call it, including six women and

06:46.561 --> 06:58.552
several racial minorities. And in the 
intervening 11 years, the

07:01.585 --> 07:09.356
texture of our social fabric had changed quite a 
bit. And additionally, we were looking at

07:09.376 --> 07:29.145
selecting people specifically in career 
patterns, i.e., as mission specialists, having

07:09.376 --> 07:29.145
created that billet, and looking at a spacecraft 
which was big enough to carry more than just the two

07:09.376 --> 07:29.145
or three that were required to fly it, We recently 
completed a Mission 7 on board, the 41G mission,

07:29.868 --> 07:39.637
and there's one Schedule 8 on board about a year 
from now. So you're getting to the point where you

07:40.378 --> 07:48.065
can afford to have a lot of differentiation in 
terms of duties and experience. It just seemed

07:48.825 --> 07:55.091
that's the way the situation fell out. In what ways 
do you think that women and minorities have added

07:55.111 --> 07:58.474
or maybe subtracted from the NASA program? Well, I 
think probably the biggest way that they've added

08:01.816 --> 08:13.689
is just by showing the American people that we've 
got a real cross-section of the population

08:01.816 --> 08:13.689
involved. You can't help but feel that you're 
getting more support from areas representing

08:13.709 --> 08:27.364
racial minorities and women's groups and things 
of this sort, and they see one of their own up there.

08:28.205 --> 08:30.488
participating and doing a good job. As you're 
probably aware, a tremendous demand for talks by

08:31.149 --> 08:41.401
and interviews with Sally Ride and some of the 
other folks. In fact, that's a bit of a personal

08:42.883 --> 08:56.279
hardship on her, and she's been relieved that Judy 
Resnick and some of the other folks wouldn't have

08:42.883 --> 08:56.279
gotten up to help share the load. Oh, that's good. I 
think it may also be interesting to look back and

08:59.812 --> 09:11.947
you note that the Soviets were the first to put a 
woman in space, Valentina Tereshkova. They made

09:11.967 --> 09:20.138
sure that she was up there by herself, but the 
technology basically was a one-person capsule at

09:11.967 --> 09:20.138
the time. And until we announced in, it must have 
been March of 82, When Sally arrived with me going

09:27.655 --> 09:36.405
up on a space shuttle flight, they had absolutely 
no interest discernible in having any more women

09:27.655 --> 09:36.405
in space. Immediately

09:36.545 --> 09:49.300
after Sally was selected and announced, we 
started getting questions along the lines of, why

09:36.545 --> 09:49.300
do you want to put a woman into space? We've already 
done it once. And so basically the implication

09:50.902 --> 09:54.346
being that was all that mattered. And what are her 
qualifications? What's she going to do up there?

09:59.787 --> 10:24.072
And then there was a long silence, and in

09:59.787 --> 10:24.072
August of 82, that is about five months later, 
during the Unispace conference in Austria, they

09:59.787 --> 10:24.072
had arranged to have a TV downlink to the 
conference, and all of a sudden they announced, by

09:59.787 --> 10:24.072
the way, Svetlana Savitskaya, for the glory of 
Mother Russia, and all that sort of thing, is the a

10:24.490 --> 10:32.318
crew member in the current Soyuz crew going up to 
the Soyuz would have a Beamer message down to the

10:24.490 --> 10:32.318
assembled delegates. So they were very anxious 
that the United States might be perceived as

10:33.639 --> 10:42.648
affording greater opportunities to humankind 
than they were. And then again this spring, when it

10:43.649 --> 10:52.438
was, I don't know, I guess it was about a year ago 
when it was announced that the Soyuz was going up

10:43.649 --> 10:52.438
again, Kathy Charlton would be performing in the 
spacewalk, the EVA. We didn't hear anything from

10:57.809 --> 11:23.151
them, but you notice about July of this year, they 
made a point of sending Svetlana Savitskaya up a

10:57.809 --> 11:23.151
second time, thereby getting the title of the 
first woman to go into space twice, and they sent

10:57.809 --> 11:23.151
her outside on the spacewalk, just so they could 
claim that the first spacewalk by a woman was done

10:57.809 --> 11:23.151
by a Soviet cosmonaut, and they're very 
interested in maintaining this sort of Guinness

11:23.738 --> 11:26.662
World Record statute on things. They don't have 
anything like the MMU do they? No, they've been

11:30.006 --> 11:48.629
interested in that too and we were privately a 
little bit apprehensive that there might be some

11:30.006 --> 11:48.629
effort underway to say a month before our flight 
back in February to do something that would claim

11:30.006 --> 11:48.629
to be an MMU flight but they didn't. STS-5 was The 
first shuttle flight to deploy a satellite, they

11:52.105 --> 12:05.563
did deploy two communications satellites, but 
about three months or two months before that, the

11:52.105 --> 12:05.563
Soviets made a point of deploying a satellite from 
the Soviet. As we can tell, it was something that

12:06.024 --> 12:13.033
opened the hatch, and they pushed it out, and they 
deployed a satellite. If you read their version of

12:13.688 --> 12:25.503
the history books, I think you will probably find 
that they claimed to have deployed the first

12:13.688 --> 12:25.503
sub-satellite or artificial satellite from a 
space station or a space group. Well, after your

12:25.523 --> 12:36.677
flight, I read a newspaper article that said that 
the Russians had said that the flight was an

12:25.523 --> 12:36.677
overall failure because of several 
malfunctions, but they overlooked the MMU

12:25.523 --> 12:36.677
flight. How do you feel about that? We did have some 
problems, but let me take them one or two at a time.

12:47.167 --> 12:54.114
You've got to bear in mind that the shuttle, being a 
space transportation system, is just that. The

12:55.736 --> 13:10.932
two communications satellites were privately 
owned, and in order to get from the shuttle

12:55.736 --> 13:10.932
altitude to the geosynchronous or geostationary 
altitude that is used for communications relay

12:55.736 --> 13:10.932
satellites, you basically need two additional 
motors or burns to boost the satellite up, first

13:11.907 --> 13:20.339
into an elliptic motor and into a circular motor, 
22,300. And the satellite manufacturer, Hughes,

13:22.081 --> 13:40.007
provides the second motor as an integral part of it 
and contracted with McDonnell Douglas to provide

13:22.081 --> 13:40.007
the first stage motor as a proprietary launch 
system that he's purchased from certified by

13:40.561 --> 13:54.836
McDonnell-Lewis, and basically the role of the 
shuttle is to carry this assembly into orbit,

13:40.561 --> 13:54.836
point it in the right direction, and deploy it at 
the specified time, all of which we did. The

13:56.417 --> 14:10.011
problem that prevented the two satellites from 
getting into orbit was that the throat of the

13:56.417 --> 14:10.011
nozzle in the first stage motor that was the 
McDonnell-Lewis thing deteriorated and blew out

13:56.417 --> 14:10.011
after about 18 seconds. into a planned 80-some 
second burn. So they got only a fraction of the

14:13.501 --> 14:17.304
velocity. And it was very consistent, too, 
because they both wound up in essentially similar

14:18.365 --> 14:25.792
orbits, about 150 by 600. So to the extent that, if 
you'll pardon my using the skydiving analogy,

14:27.434 --> 14:39.745
that if a skydiver's parachute doesn't open, he's 
going to hold the power to the plane responsible.

14:40.079 --> 15:05.867
uh we don't feel that nasa was responsible for the 
failures but we acknowledge that you've got to

14:40.079 --> 15:05.867
consider in the context of the overall system 
there was a problem at the same time we were anxious

14:40.079 --> 15:05.867
to in the next mission 51a is going to go up there and 
try to retrieve these two satellites and bring

14:40.079 --> 15:05.867
them back for refurbishment so you can at least say 
that Things launched on expendable launch

15:06.607 --> 15:12.753
vehicles like the Ariane or the Delta tend to wind 
up at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. No problem

15:13.334 --> 15:14.235
over there, is there? Things launched out of the 
shuttle tend to be in orbit because you're already

15:15.676 --> 15:19.760
in orbit when you deploy them. Okay. You were 
admitted to NASA in the period following the

15:25.006 --> 15:29.010
launches of Sputniks 1 and 2. This time might be 
called the American race for space. What do you

15:33.674 --> 15:36.377
feel was the emotional tone of that period? um 
before we had our before we landed on the moon well

15:36.779 --> 16:06.718
when i came in which is in 66 eight years after uh 
well almost nine years after the first sputnik i

15:36.779 --> 16:06.718
wouldn't say that we really had a a race for space 
mentality we were more concerned about the the

15:36.779 --> 16:06.718
timetable that had been agreed to i.e man on the 
moon when we turned before the end of 69 and the

16:08.217 --> 16:16.909
efforts were bent more towards working against 
the calendar than they were racing with the

16:08.217 --> 16:16.909
Russians. We heard at one time that they were 
interested in sending manned spacecraft to the

16:16.929 --> 16:25.581
Moon, and we didn't hear any more about that. When 
the actual Apollo 11 occasion did come around,

16:25.601 --> 16:32.631
they were most cooperative. They had Luna 16 in 
orbit. around the moon. This was an unmanned

16:37.941 --> 16:42.648
reconnaissance or photographic probe. They 
contacted us in the control center and offered to

16:42.668 --> 17:00.634
do anything that was necessary to keep Luna 16 out 
of the way of Apollo 11, because they didn't want to

16:42.668 --> 17:00.634
shoulder the responsibility for any sort of 
problems with the lunar landing or returns. I

17:00.918 --> 17:15.832
thought

17:00.918 --> 17:15.832
that President Kennedy had kind of a grudge match 
going with the Russians about the space race. That

17:16.212 --> 17:18.374
was the impression I received over the years. I 
don't think you can call it a grudge match. One of

17:24.319 --> 17:30.385
the things that I think is interesting and useful 
in the international arena is that In

17:31.883 --> 17:45.737
undertakings in space, basically, whenever the 
players are competing against natural

17:31.883 --> 17:45.737
obstacles, it's a situation where there really 
aren't any losers. If we win and get the man to the

17:46.538 --> 17:54.747
moon and back, basically, we've done so as 
representatives of humanity. It's not really a

17:55.047 --> 18:01.013
matter of, hey, we beat the Russians and now let's 
see what other events we can You notice that during

18:01.668 --> 18:17.874
Apollo 11 there was worldwide non-political 
interest just in the fact that, hey, here's some

18:01.668 --> 18:17.874
people that happen to be Americans that are up 
there really walking around on the moon. And even

18:18.715 --> 18:20.638
the Soviets applauded that.

18:24.567 --> 18:32.295
Well, how do you view Russia's involvement in 
space, and do you think that they have added

18:24.567 --> 18:32.295
valuable technology to our space program, or have 
we aided them? Well, I can't say that I'm aware of

18:34.357 --> 18:42.945
any technology that we've just gotten from the 
Russians. My general assessment, and I caution

18:44.227 --> 18:52.515
you that it's just a general one, is that our 
program is technologically superior and more

18:53.255 --> 19:02.347
sophisticated than the Soviet program. However, 
they have a national commitment to applying the

19:02.367 --> 19:14.663
things that they have developed, specifically 
the Soyuz and the Soyuz space station. They

19:16.265 --> 19:20.410
apparently are willing to manufacture Soyuz 
spacecraft in fairly large numbers so they can go

19:21.200 --> 19:25.506
and use them. And with the Salyut, their space 
station, the first one of which was put up in 71,

19:25.526 --> 19:48.135
Salyut 1, I think it was 71, they've had 
essentially a continuous stream of these space

19:25.526 --> 19:48.135
stations up there, presumably getting slightly 
larger and with more equipment on them. Recently

19:49.010 --> 19:52.914
they had a crew of three continuously aloft for 238 
days. They're very interested in the physiology

19:53.094 --> 20:02.663
of long-term exposure to weightlessness. Some 
people take this as a sign that they are working

20:04.245 --> 20:17.818
very hard to be able to put a man or a man in orbit 
around Mars first. When you look at a Mars mission,

20:18.237 --> 20:45.983
for any economical

20:18.237 --> 20:45.983
propellant scenario, generally it's going to 
take you about a year to get there and about a year to

20:18.237 --> 20:45.983
get back, so you need to understand what is 
involved in either providing artificial gravity

20:18.237 --> 20:45.983
or enabling the human body to withstand 
weightlessness for a period of about two years and

20:18.237 --> 20:45.983
then readapt to gravity when you get back here. 
They had a great deal of trouble. I understand they

20:50.545 --> 20:57.171
couldn't walk for—well, they're still having 
trouble walking now after that period of

20:50.545 --> 20:57.171
non-weightlifting. Well, I confess I really 
haven't gotten any details on that, but the guys

20:57.231 --> 21:08.463
that were up for 211 days, the previous bunch, 
didn't seem to have any trouble at all with

20:57.231 --> 21:08.463
happening. Our philosophy from Skylab 
experience has been that if the individuals

21:08.483 --> 21:15.210
involved exercise diligently every day and keep 
in shape, you probably won't have any

21:15.747 --> 21:26.199
difficulties. What was the other part? Oh, have 
they gotten anything from us? I guess we would have

21:31.185 --> 21:38.094
to say that they appear to have gotten some things 
from us. They have copied some of our operational

21:39.535 --> 21:44.421
techniques. Prior to the Apollo-Soyuz mission, 
their control center was a mysterious place, and

21:44.789 --> 22:01.909
they announced in the newspapers, after their 
cosmonauts were in orbit, by the way, yesterday

21:44.789 --> 22:01.909
they were launched and they were doing well and 
happy. I hope you learned a lot about public

22:01.929 --> 22:11.320
relations in the Apollo-Soyuz mission, because 
now they've televised some of their launches,

22:01.929 --> 22:11.320
they show pictures of the inside of the control 
center, keep their own citizenry at least a lot

22:13.105 --> 22:28.139
more involved

22:13.105 --> 22:28.139
in what's going on. Additionally, it appears that 
the Soviets are building something that looks

22:28.159 --> 22:34.966
like a space shuttle.

22:37.268 --> 22:41.712
You see pictures and reports in Aviation Week and 
various other sources It may be that they're

22:42.485 --> 22:47.533
attempting to copy the space shuttle technology.

22:50.197 --> 22:57.128
Their approach is more to the shuttle than just the 
exterior configuration, so it'll be interesting

22:50.197 --> 22:57.128
to see how they do with that. Russia has had people 
of other nations fly with them on space missions.

23:02.877 --> 23:04.700
Do you see America doing the same in the future? 
Well, we already have. Oh, yeah? In November of

23:08.346 --> 23:09.808
last year, On the first space lab mission, we had a 
West German payload specialist, Ulf Merbold,

23:10.058 --> 23:23.675
representing ESA, the European Space Agency, as a 
crew member. And on this last flight, 41G, we had a

23:23.695 --> 23:34.589
Canadian naval officer, Martin Garneau, on board 
as a payload specialist. There are a lot more in the

23:34.629 --> 23:37.753
offing. The situation, I'm chagrined to say, has 
gotten to the point where I can no longer keep track

23:38.594 --> 23:45.502
of all the crew assignments and who's on what. But 
we have commitments to, or have extended offers

23:45.562 --> 24:06.947
to, oh boy, China, Brazil, Australia, Saudi 
Arabia, and

23:45.562 --> 24:06.947
I think Argentina, but I'm not sure. But in total, 
about a dozen different countries have their crew

24:07.923 --> 24:22.436
members fly on the shuttle, and we are actively 
seeking international participation in the

24:07.923 --> 24:22.436
space station program. It's expected that the 
Japanese will build a module to go on the space

24:22.876 --> 24:37.069
station, and the European Space Agency, ESA, is 
expected to participate, and the Canadian

24:22.876 --> 24:37.069
Government will probably manipulator arm for the 
space station as they did the manipulator arm for

24:37.302 --> 24:41.688
the shuttle.

24:45.773 --> 24:56.247
Has President Reagan's administration affected 
NASA's budget or overall

24:45.773 --> 24:56.247
purpose? Well, I think Mr. Reagan has been very 
supportive of the first space shuttle.

25:03.296 --> 25:03.917
Obviously, it was already well underway when he 
came into office, but he recognized the potential

25:04.673 --> 25:18.470
of the system and the need to continue the funding 
to continue the development on it. And my opinion

25:18.490 --> 25:33.769
is that he was initially reluctant to commit 
additional money to do things beyond applying the

25:18.490 --> 25:33.769
space shuttle, and then he was convinced of the 
utility of the space station basically endorsed

25:34.846 --> 25:41.236
it, gave the go-ahead back in January during the 
State of the Union speech. And although it is not a

25:41.256 --> 26:01.967
NASA program, he has recently initiated this 
so-called Strategic Defense Initiative for Star

25:41.256 --> 26:01.967
Wars project within the Air Force to see if there is 
a way, using the space vantage point of the space

25:41.256 --> 26:01.967
technology, to get out of this assured mutual 
destruction our mutually assured destruction

26:02.352 --> 26:11.306
stalemate between ourselves and the Soviet

26:02.352 --> 26:11.306
Union. Well, my next question is about the Star 
Wars defense. Does NASA have any plans to aid

26:13.529 --> 26:20.059
President Reagan in developing a space defense 
program for Star Wars? MR. No. Getting back to one

26:21.982 --> 26:27.651
of the previous questions, NASA is a civilian 
space agency. There is also a fairly large

26:27.952 --> 26:40.348
military space program, as you're probably 
aware, administered by the Air Force, but with

26:27.952 --> 26:40.348
involvement from other services and other 
governmental agencies. And the Strategic

26:41.490 --> 26:50.322
Defense Initiative is strictly a military air 
force program and is being carried out by them.

26:51.703 --> 26:56.710
Lieutenant General James Abrahamson, who was 
associate administrator for manned spaceflight

26:59.153 --> 27:03.120
at NASA for a couple of years. He was heading up the 
Strategic Defense Initiative. He's an Air Force

27:08.370 --> 27:19.710
officer, and his responsibility prior to coming 
to NASA was as the program manager of the F-16

27:08.370 --> 27:19.710
fighter program, so it's certainly in keeping 
with his background.

27:23.065 --> 27:31.638
What do you think of President Reagan's plans to 
have people such as poets, musicians, teachers,

27:23.065 --> 27:31.638
and businessmen go into space with you and 
observe? Well, the basic philosophy arose out of a

27:31.658 --> 27:47.622
recognition that on every space shuttle flight, 
we had seats for at least seven people, and that we

27:31.658 --> 27:47.622
were generally not filling them up with 
professional and these seats could be filled at

27:48.580 --> 27:59.931
very small additional cost since they were going 
on anyway. And it was recognized that since the

28:00.972 --> 28:17.389
American taxpayer is paying for the basic shuttle 
program and subsidizing the flights, although

28:00.972 --> 28:17.389
we're getting a lot of the operating expenses back 
from the commercial users now, that we might as

28:00.972 --> 28:17.389
well look around and and see if we couldn't carry 
some American citizens to share the experience.

28:24.011 --> 28:42.071
The charter of NASA under the Space Act of 1958 is 
sufficiently broad to allow us to do things like

28:24.011 --> 28:42.071
this, with the justification being the 
dissemination of knowledge and the advancement

28:24.011 --> 28:42.071
of technology and the state of the art in the space 
program. And it was more a matter of determining

28:44.434 --> 28:47.477
how you would select people like this so that the 
American public was generally supportive of the

28:48.149 --> 29:08.832
fact that Mrs. so-and-so or Mr. so-and-so or Dr. 
somebody or other was going up instead of

28:48.149 --> 29:08.832
wondering why in the world the agency picked a 
person like that. The system was set up to allow us

29:10.273 --> 29:18.122
to carry journalists poets, artists, executives 
or managers from private industry, as well as the

29:18.625 --> 29:29.000
middle levels of the government, educators. And 
with Mr. Reagan's selection of an educator,

29:29.020 --> 29:47.788
secondary

29:29.020 --> 29:47.788
school or elementary teacher, which is his call as 
the chief executive to be the first one, gave the

29:29.020 --> 29:47.788
program 100% green light. We're looking forward 
to seeing somebody in about a year to come fly with

29:49.135 --> 29:53.720
us. Will they have to go through a certain program 
to get ready for the flight? Yeah. We don't think

29:58.685 --> 30:04.451
it'll be a very elaborate program, probably about 
two months or maybe a little longer. One of the

30:05.872 --> 30:16.223
primary things you would like to assure yourself 
of in any sort of training program like this is that

30:05.872 --> 30:16.223
in the event that there is some sort of a a crisis 
situation on board the shuttle. That individual

30:19.317 --> 30:36.101
will not get hysterical and go to pieces or try to do 
something rash, but he'll be content to stay out of

30:19.317 --> 30:36.101
the way, strap in a seat or something, and let the 
crew handle the problem, getting all panicky. And

30:36.161 --> 30:44.353
then, of course, they will trade him for whoever in 
operating some of the facilities in the Shuttle,

30:44.553 --> 30:53.445
that we can be an independent person and not have to 
rely on the food for everything. Using the manned

30:53.465 --> 30:58.872
mobile unit, or the MMU, you were the world's first 
human satellite. How did you feel at the time?

31:10.085 --> 31:28.009
The feeling was more of a release than anything 
else in that I had been working on the program for

31:10.085 --> 31:28.009
quite a number of years, and we had had troubles 
with the two communication systems, like

31:10.085 --> 31:28.009
sanitation and inflatable run of the balloon. And 
in some of the previous missions, the guys had

31:27.989 --> 31:36.480
trouble even getting the pressure set to work 
properly. You know, we were somewhat

31:36.500 --> 31:38.944
apprehensive. There might be something come up 
that would either cancel the EVAs or bring the

31:38.964 --> 31:46.954
whole mission back early or something like that. 
So close and yet so far.
