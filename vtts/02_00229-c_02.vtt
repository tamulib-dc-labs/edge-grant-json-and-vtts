00:02.798 --> 00:11.051
Today is April 30, 1984, and I am interviewing Norman Borlaug again.

00:11.331 --> 00:22.249
And last time, we got up to about the time of your graduate work at Minnesota.

00:22.269 --> 00:28.699
And I was wondering, you got a master's degree in plant pathology in 1940 and a doctorate just one year later.

00:29.120 --> 00:30.662
How did you do that?

00:30.811 --> 00:42.583
Well, first of all, it may well be listed in plant pathology, but my first graduate degree, the master's, was really in forest pathology.

00:42.983 --> 00:54.915
My thesis was in forest pathology problem, and it happened, I don't remember whether we touched on this in how I came back to graduate school or not, but just in the case we did not.

00:56.316 --> 00:58.438
The last

00:59.313 --> 01:01.957
Where do you have it down as plant pathology?

01:01.977 --> 01:02.297
All right.

01:02.798 --> 01:15.014
But the last quarter when I was there, about two weeks before graduation, I saw on the bulletin board that Dr. E.C.

01:15.094 --> 01:25.068
Stakeman was giving a Sigma Psi lecture on the shifty little enemies that destroy our crops.

01:25.869 --> 01:26.890
So I want to hear this.

01:28.928 --> 01:33.514
And Dr. Stakeman is one of the most forceful lecturers that I ever heard.

01:33.554 --> 01:41.605
He has this rare capacity to really bring you close to him or he close to you.

01:43.327 --> 01:54.301
And he always spices his lectures, even though they may be very technical, with a lot of general interest, how it touches the masses of people.

01:54.321 --> 01:58.767
And I was very impressed.

01:59.911 --> 02:07.660
And I said that someday if I ever study at graduate level, I would like to study under him.

02:07.860 --> 02:17.951
And so it turned out that I was supposed to have gone back to Idaho permanent job in the Forest Service in February.

02:18.792 --> 02:23.418
I had passed my civil service exam with a pretty good reading.

02:24.419 --> 02:27.302
And I got a letter from the

02:27.991 --> 02:32.817
supervisor of the Idaho National said, look, we've got a little budgetary problem.

02:33.398 --> 02:42.911
If it's all right with you, could you wait until the first of May or the middle of May, which is really when we need you anyway?

02:42.931 --> 02:44.293
So I wrote back and said yes.

02:44.893 --> 02:50.421
That being the case, I registered in plant pathology to start a master's degree.

02:51.042 --> 02:55.708
But I was still interested in forest pathology.

02:55.748 --> 02:57.390
I wouldn't budge the whole way.

02:57.657 --> 03:05.728
And so I started working with Clyde M. Christensen as my counselor on the forest pathology problem.

03:05.748 --> 03:11.115
Sure, I took the general courses that you would in general plant pathology.

03:11.696 --> 03:17.904
And then I got my master's in that field and shifted over to general.

03:18.144 --> 03:26.415
The reason that there's such a short difference in the time I got this, after I had taken part of this coursework,

03:27.290 --> 03:41.604
This hurricane came through New England, and there was a timber salvage operation by the Forest Service, and so they called me and asked if I would, knowing that I had worked there before, would be interested and do this.

03:41.744 --> 03:49.172
And so I figured, well, maybe I can get a little more money together here to come back and spend a little easier life in graduate school.

03:49.212 --> 03:52.435
So I went out there and dropped out of school and then came back.

03:52.956 --> 03:55.238
And the result was that I took that

03:55.808 --> 03:57.770
and then my course worked for my masters.

03:58.972 --> 04:04.038
I took my delayed exam, in other words, for my masters.

04:04.058 --> 04:10.366
And at the same time that I was fairly well along on my doctorate, the exact dates I don't remember.

04:11.508 --> 04:20.719
And then I had all my thesis work done, all my coursework done, and the last year when I was at Minnesota, starting in

04:23.568 --> 04:36.252
Well, I taught in the general college, and then accepted this job to go to DuPont.

04:37.054 --> 04:38.576
But I hadn't written my thesis yet.

04:38.637 --> 04:39.719
I had all the data.

04:39.879 --> 04:41.141
I had all the data.

04:42.063 --> 04:46.251
My thesis was on flax wilt.

04:46.687 --> 04:55.900
the fungus that causes damping off of the plantlets and sometimes killing of the more mature plants in flax.

04:56.622 --> 04:58.544
Fusarium lini is the fungus.

04:59.366 --> 05:13.386
And I was studying the pathogenic or the variation in the pathogenicity of the fungus in the different soils

05:14.176 --> 05:25.456
where flax was grown and trying to do something about making crosses and combinations which would give descendants a progeny which would be resistant to this.

05:25.736 --> 05:26.357
What did you find?

05:27.158 --> 05:29.943
Well, we found quite a few interesting things.

05:30.023 --> 05:35.593
This was the first time that anyone had worked in depth on the variation in this and we found

05:36.502 --> 05:50.058
some types that were very pathogenic, but that if you use the right parent, no problem in crossing them and recovering from this progeny that combined resistance to many.

05:50.779 --> 05:59.909
And these had been sent to several different stations, including North Dakota and a couple places in Minnesota, and I think one up in Canada.

05:59.989 --> 06:03.133
The details escaped me now.

06:04.649 --> 06:07.451
we found that it was fairly stable resistance.

06:07.592 --> 06:19.102
And as a matter of fact, flax wilt, not just because of that, but sort of was no longer a major disease.

06:19.242 --> 06:34.335
You see, flax, when you re-grew it on the same soil, start out in virgin soil, as far as flax was concerned, you'd have high yields and then it'd peter out because of the killing of many of the plants.

06:34.771 --> 06:48.288
That early work, I think, was done originally out in North Dakota by Dr. Bali, who was a friend of Dr. Stateman's.

06:48.568 --> 06:50.391
And is that why you did this?

06:50.431 --> 06:52.734
Because Stateman had an interest in it then?

06:53.134 --> 06:53.615
I think so.

06:53.695 --> 06:55.477
Or did you develop your own interest in this?

06:55.497 --> 06:58.601
No, I was a scientist at the doctorate level.

06:59.302 --> 07:03.968
Nobody had really done a very adequate job of finding out about the

07:04.353 --> 07:06.937
variation in pathogenicity at that time.

07:07.538 --> 07:17.053
I think it might be interesting to say that since we are talking about Dr. Stakeman, I just got my copy of Dr. E.C.

07:17.114 --> 07:22.683
Stakeman, Scientist and Statesman for Agriculture, I believe is his title, was just published.

07:23.804 --> 07:25.828
My copy just came last Thursday.

07:26.829 --> 07:28.572
Unfortunately, I left it at home today.

07:29.243 --> 07:31.065
And it was written by C.M.

07:31.186 --> 07:41.099
Clyde M. Christensen, who was the professor originally of forest pathology when I studied there, under whom I started my master's.

07:42.100 --> 07:59.082
But later in his professional career, he became interested in mycotoxins and was one of the early people who worked on aflatoxin, the highly toxic carcinogenic property that...

07:59.281 --> 08:04.566
produced by Aspergillus Flavus, and he writes very well.

08:05.647 --> 08:07.348
I'm going to order up some copies.

08:07.969 --> 08:08.950
When did he publish it?

08:09.510 --> 08:11.032
It just came off the press last week.

08:11.312 --> 08:11.632
Really?

08:12.653 --> 08:13.914
And it's the life of Stakeman.

08:13.954 --> 08:15.056
He probably knew him.

08:15.656 --> 08:17.398
So, Christensen's still alive, huh?

08:18.158 --> 08:20.781
There were two Christensens in the department, but C.M.

08:20.801 --> 08:27.567
Christensen Clyde, who did the work I just described to you, was

08:28.373 --> 08:34.740
He retired as, what do they call, the outstanding professors?

08:34.900 --> 08:35.421
Emeritus?

08:36.522 --> 08:38.725
No, but before he became emeritus.

08:39.886 --> 08:40.827
Distinguished professor?

08:40.847 --> 08:54.482
Distinguished professor, and he taught not only in the College of Agriculture, but in the medical school on fungal diseases of human beings.

08:54.952 --> 09:05.426
a very good writer, so he's just published this book, which is a good insight into the, it was published by the American Phytopathological Society in St.

09:05.446 --> 09:09.472
Paul, and it gives a good insight into Dr.

09:09.492 --> 09:10.253
E.C.'

09:10.233 --> 09:10.894
's statement.

09:10.954 --> 09:24.452
As a matter of fact, I wrote the foreword for it, and he was a guy that, I think I may have told you, he tried to make you reach for a star, whether you reached it or not, that was another matter.

09:24.854 --> 09:54.827
But he also had the unique ability to be able to try to sort of sense what the niche was that most of his graduate students might feel very satisfactorily taking into consideration their academic and scientific excellence and also their temperament and personality and interest and find slots where they would

09:55.820 --> 09:58.263
do a good job and still be happy.

09:58.283 --> 10:02.409
That was one of Stakeman's outstanding characteristics as a teacher.

10:03.170 --> 10:10.200
I've said many times that he was probably one of the great teachers and educators of this century and maybe of all centuries.

10:12.042 --> 10:17.290
Now I'd like to ask you what impact he had on your life.

10:17.871 --> 10:18.291
Stakeman?

10:18.391 --> 10:19.453
Yeah.

10:19.473 --> 10:19.993
Tremendous.

10:21.255 --> 10:23.278
Both at the time when I was there

10:25.486 --> 10:53.282
At the time probably I didn't appreciate it very much because I have just said that when I made the shift it was to forest pathology but he was too wise to leave me there because and he told me eventually when he was trying to convert me to general plant pathology that your opportunities for employment in forest pathology

10:55.388 --> 10:57.571
at the present time are very limited.

10:57.871 --> 11:07.585
There's so few positions that will give you sufficient support, budgetary support, so that you can do a decent job.

11:07.605 --> 11:22.746
The better you study general plant pathology, and with that, if a position opens in forestry, forest pathology, you can go that way, but you can't come from forest pathology to general seropatology without

11:23.603 --> 11:27.048
lots of difficulties and many doors won't open for you.

11:27.068 --> 11:41.248
As a matter of fact at the same time there was another forester from Yale who later became a very good plant pathologist who was going through the same doors at about the same time.

11:42.290 --> 11:52.885
He later became the, see if I can come up with his name right now, at Washington State their head seropathologist many years later.

11:53.607 --> 12:04.178
Walt Hendricks and so we kind of got the same treatment but this was why and I think he was the statement was very wise in insisting on this.

12:06.460 --> 12:09.183
Would you consider him sort of your intellectual father then?

12:09.423 --> 12:16.150
Yes, statement by all means was right down to his waning days.

12:17.171 --> 12:23.057
As a matter of fact he died at the age of 94.

12:23.780 --> 12:45.518
and up until about a year before he died mentally he was just as sharp as a tank and the last year before he had the stroke I invited him down to Mexico to our west coast so that he could

12:46.274 --> 12:54.264
give a few seminars to these young people that came from all different countries, and in part to get them out of the snow and the blizzards in Minnesota at that time.

12:54.924 --> 12:56.246
He accepted and he came.

12:57.347 --> 13:04.977
We thought that it might be nice for him to give one a week for one hour, but it wasn't made that way.

13:05.057 --> 13:09.742
He decided he had to give at least two, and generally there were two or three hours.

13:10.323 --> 13:13.547
At that season of the year, especially during harvest,

13:14.135 --> 13:15.296
approaching harvest.

13:15.316 --> 13:24.985
There would be many senior scientists visiting our station from U.S., from Canada, from Australia, from many countries.

13:25.005 --> 13:34.414
And I used to once in a while wander into the seminar room and here I would see many of these senior scientists.

13:34.474 --> 13:42.842
They were sitting on their little pollinating stool that they were carrying out to the field plots and they wanted to hear him talk to these young people.

13:43.278 --> 13:55.977
He still had lots of spark and charisma and ability to sell science to young people but also to more senior people right down to the end.

13:56.418 --> 14:08.256
The last day when he was there, the last work day as it were, I asked him if he would be willing to give a public lecture.

14:08.557 --> 14:37.365
our auditorium is small it probably won't hold more than 150 something like that at our research center and since there are a lot of visiting all the trainees about probably 40 or so of them from different countries and some of our senior staff and the staff of the National Institute were there couldn't open it up to the general public but I said I'd like to invite some of the people the farmer groups who have been

14:37.784 --> 14:44.054
responsible for economic support to our programs, if you would be willing to do this.

14:45.657 --> 14:47.199
We said, oh, I'd like to do this.

14:48.221 --> 14:56.534
So it was arranged, and people that I'd been affiliated with in the local community, starting with the Cayes family, they were there.

14:57.156 --> 15:04.247
The widow of Don Rodolfo Cayes and his daughter and son were there, sitting in the front row.

15:04.936 --> 15:14.130
So I had a nice little table and the microphone on the table down on the platform, and so I introduced Dickman, and I said I'd arranged that he was going to sit down and be relaxed.

15:15.812 --> 15:17.855
But that wasn't the way he was made.

15:17.895 --> 15:34.420
I'd no sooner introduced him, and he stood up, and he stood there for an hour and 15 minutes, and he told about the history of agriculture, not only agriculture, well, both agriculture and science, from the beginning up until then.

15:35.665 --> 15:38.309
And he does a magnificent job.

15:38.970 --> 15:41.514
And then... And he was 92 at the time?

15:41.534 --> 15:41.875
He was 92.

15:41.895 --> 15:46.682
And then he said, now, if there are any questions, I'll be glad to try to answer them.

15:46.702 --> 15:48.625
And then this started.

15:48.645 --> 15:53.573
Finally, after about a half an hour of that, I decided to kill the poor guy.

15:54.013 --> 15:55.095
So we called it off.

15:55.115 --> 16:01.806
And that night, the Thais family invited us over for barbecue over in their backyard.

16:01.846 --> 16:02.787
It was warm then.

16:03.425 --> 16:05.768
more or less this time of the year, a little later.

16:06.409 --> 16:07.670
No, about this time of the year.

16:08.391 --> 16:14.699
And so we were going to accompany him back to St.

16:14.759 --> 16:20.326
Paul because we weren't so sure that he was in that good health.

16:20.386 --> 16:22.669
He had problems with moving.

16:23.450 --> 16:30.618
He had probably already had a slight stroke, judging from the way his leg movements were.

16:30.638 --> 16:31.980
But the night before he said,

16:32.365 --> 16:34.387
Well, I have to go to Mexico City.

16:35.168 --> 16:43.376
I have to go down and see how the graduate school is doing, which he was instrumental in starting, the first graduate school in agricultural science in Latin America.

16:43.897 --> 16:50.964
He had been the both academic and spiritual founder.

16:52.226 --> 16:59.233
And I tried to talk him out of it and I called our office and I said,

17:00.007 --> 17:05.114
Look, I think that to take them up to that elevation might not be good.

17:05.134 --> 17:12.524
And I talked to our assistant director who was from Minnesota, Robert Osler, and he said, well, I'll call you tomorrow morning.

17:12.564 --> 17:14.707
We'll talk it over here.

17:14.727 --> 17:20.675
Well, to make a long story short, they called and they said, well, we've talked it over.

17:20.715 --> 17:22.418
And they said, I'd like to see what you think.

17:22.678 --> 17:29.828
If something should go wrong, this is probably the way he'd like to happen, with his boots on.

17:29.977 --> 17:34.502
And so he insisted he was going and I called him.

17:34.542 --> 17:43.571
They went out and got him at the airport and they arranged so that somebody would come up and they'd drive the car out onto the ramp and that wasn't any good.

17:43.611 --> 17:46.313
He wanted to go through the regular things which he did.

17:47.074 --> 17:50.277
He went out to the graduate school and he gave a lecture.

17:52.299 --> 17:59.106
Then he went to our center and he gave us a seminar and he was wonderfully happy and he

17:59.356 --> 18:11.388
went back to Minneapolis, and about six weeks later, in a very hot spell, apparently got dehydrated and had an attack when he was at home.

18:12.409 --> 18:18.515
And he lived, but never the same easy statement, I think about a year, a little more than a year.

18:20.357 --> 18:25.262
So he probably died of some sort of stroke then?

18:25.282 --> 18:26.924
Well, he was a fabulous character.

18:27.344 --> 18:29.346
And it was he.

18:29.731 --> 18:34.235
He was one of the three who made the feasibility study of the Rockefeller program.

18:34.315 --> 18:45.425
I think we mentioned this early, I believe, in one of the early tapes, when the request for assistance had come to Vice President Henry Wallace.

18:45.445 --> 18:46.926
No, we haven't got to that yet.

18:46.986 --> 18:47.526
Oh, excuse me.

18:47.587 --> 18:49.548
So then I'll cut it off here.

18:49.608 --> 18:51.210
Yeah, because we'll get to that.

18:51.230 --> 18:51.990
Okay.

18:52.010 --> 18:54.553
Because I want to find out how Rockefeller got involved.

18:54.573 --> 18:55.193
Okay.

18:55.293 --> 18:59.637
And I found out some things these last two weeks since I saw you.

19:00.106 --> 19:20.145
about how all the threads are underneath with Dr. Seaman Knapp, the first demonstration, agricultural demonstrator in the U.S., indirectly the father of the extension services of all USA, was entangled.

19:20.425 --> 19:20.986
Oh, good.

19:21.306 --> 19:23.148
He was inducted into the Hall of Fame.

19:23.868 --> 19:25.450
Oh, and so when you were running?

19:25.670 --> 19:27.632
Yeah, right, sure.

19:27.848 --> 19:36.959
Well, we'll get to that, but I want to get back to the University of Minnesota now, and in 1941, you were finished, and then why did you become an instructor there?

19:37.079 --> 19:42.826
Why didn't you go to work back for the government, to work for a company, or...?

19:42.846 --> 19:46.250
Well, I was doing this while I was trying to write my thesis.

19:46.450 --> 19:46.971
Oh, okay.

19:46.991 --> 19:52.878
But the point was that I didn't get any time to write because I was digging right in front of those students.

19:53.118 --> 19:53.398
Sure.

19:53.859 --> 19:57.383
And this was across the... It was a broad-scoped

19:57.953 --> 20:12.595
Horizon course, it was natural resources and basic wealth, land and water, plants, forests, Exactly, for liberal arts students and mineral resource.

20:14.478 --> 20:16.982
So that's what kept me there.

20:17.002 --> 20:18.224
And you did that for one year?

20:18.524 --> 20:20.527
No, just for a quarter.

20:20.648 --> 20:26.897
It was, the assignment was for a year, but then when I got to sign this job with DuPont,

20:27.367 --> 20:30.090
then I left to accept that.

20:30.610 --> 20:33.293
Okay, well the war erupted in 1941.

20:35.015 --> 20:36.316
Why didn't you go into the military?

20:37.317 --> 20:49.710
Because I'd accepted this job and I was out in DuPont when the order came and by that time the War Manpower Commission was getting involved in all of this.

20:50.031 --> 20:56.057
As a matter of fact I got to I think at least two

20:56.645 --> 21:25.791
maybe three, I think three induction notice report to Camp Dix at such and such a date and always something happened that said just a minute because all sorts of problems started appearing on the horizon and at that time there were only two sort of microbiological laboratories in the whole USA, the Pant and Dow, putting to one side the pharmaceutical but those working on

21:26.362 --> 21:31.872
microorganisms in various other incendiary kinds of capacities.

21:31.972 --> 21:43.554
And so this laboratory was converted over to one of these dollar a year contracts for doing whatever kinds of services that the military wanted.

21:45.117 --> 21:50.226
They ran the whole gamut of things, testing different kinds of materials for different kinds of uses.

21:50.948 --> 21:53.792
all sorts of things with camouflage paints.

21:54.032 --> 21:55.173
Yeah, well, we're going to get to that.

21:55.314 --> 21:58.217
I want to find out about all those different types of experiments.

21:58.878 --> 22:04.586
I wanted to find out, though, first about what were your feelings as soon as the war erupted?

22:04.606 --> 22:17.462
I mean, did you want to go into the military in some capacity, or would you have rather gone to work in more of a defense like DuPont doing research?

22:17.915 --> 22:20.099
Well, I didn't have any feeling for this.

22:20.239 --> 22:25.026
I guess it hit everyone pretty much by surprise, at least it did me.

22:25.728 --> 22:33.780
And so I had never thought much about what the alternatives were.

22:33.881 --> 22:36.665
I thought I would soon have been inducted.

22:37.607 --> 22:44.698
And it so happened that in our laboratory we had lots of technicians that were well

22:45.202 --> 22:58.537
experienced, had worked for quite a few years, not university people, but good technicians that had handled many of these problems, and suddenly all of those were pulled out and everything got all tangled up.

22:58.577 --> 23:01.821
There were very little supervisory capacity.

23:02.902 --> 23:11.952
They brought back technicians, all young girls, just out of high school, and it was kind of a mess everywhere, and then

23:12.185 --> 23:13.367
these problems started.

23:13.387 --> 23:15.470
So the original technicians then were drafted?

23:15.971 --> 23:23.062
They were all drafted, unless there was somebody with a 4F health problem.

23:23.463 --> 23:28.311
Okay, well let's talk then about how you got involved with DuPont.

23:28.331 --> 23:39.188
The way I probably got this job was the person, Dr. Frank Cawford, who had also taken his major

23:40.383 --> 23:54.177
in plant pathology, but he was a forest pathologist under Dr. Stakeman, had originally, after he'd got his degree, and I knew him as an instructor.

23:54.197 --> 24:01.104
As a matter of fact, I guess I took a course or so from him in forestry, had gone to DuPont.

24:01.124 --> 24:05.669
This was several years before, maybe three or maybe four, maybe even five.

24:06.449 --> 24:08.972
And he had started working on wood chemicals.

24:09.475 --> 24:14.821
chemicals for use in wood in various capacities.

24:16.042 --> 24:23.750
And then he had been offered a, I don't remember if it was professorship, associate professorship, I suppose, back in Minnesota.

24:24.411 --> 24:32.119
And so he came back maybe a year or more before I had finished.

24:32.139 --> 24:35.803
And

24:37.538 --> 25:07.410
temporarily or then they hired someone else but for some reason he didn't stay he stayed only about a year left and I suspect pretty strongly that when when letters were sent to different institutions one must have come to the University of Minnesota to stake them probably or maybe to Crawford or maybe both and I was recommended by

25:08.116 --> 25:15.983
for this job and this was, as I say, probably in the summer of... 42.

25:16.003 --> 25:17.865
No, 41.

25:17.925 --> 25:18.365
41.

25:18.626 --> 25:21.068
Then it was before the war erupted now.

25:21.088 --> 25:21.328
Yes.

25:21.568 --> 25:26.353
Oh, so you were working... Before, I had the contract before.

25:26.593 --> 25:30.096
Oh, you had the contract, but you didn't go to work until 1942.

25:31.297 --> 25:34.580
Just the end of December 41.

25:34.700 --> 25:37.903
I was in, I was in route

25:38.542 --> 25:40.746
Pearl Harbor.

25:40.766 --> 25:43.530
You were en route to Dupont when you heard about Pearl Harbor?

25:44.071 --> 25:46.155
Then I didn't know whether to go or to come back.

25:48.599 --> 25:50.542
So, yes.

25:51.564 --> 25:59.057
I got out there and the world seems to crumble every day.

25:59.878 --> 26:02.102
Another big disaster.

26:03.938 --> 26:29.254
one of the Normandy was blowing up and this that the big passenger troop carrying thing in one of the eastern harbors I've forgotten whether it was New York or New Jersey or someplace one thing after another and of course everything was coming apart in the South Pacific and all the troublesome

26:29.943 --> 26:33.446
the South Pacific, sooner.

26:33.466 --> 26:35.928
A lot of them were coming into the labs.

26:36.709 --> 26:38.911
Now, what was your title?

26:39.051 --> 26:40.032
What was your job?

26:40.152 --> 26:41.233
What were your responsibilities?

26:41.253 --> 26:58.768
I was classified as a microbiologist, and originally it would have been to have worked on agricultural chemicals, including wood chemicals, but that never got unfolded because before that happened,

27:00.200 --> 27:23.102
military pretty largely decided what was to be done and as so many contracts were in order to and this must have been by mutual agreement of the companies and the armed forces and the government how those were worked out with my young age at that time I had no way of knowing but war manpower

27:23.403 --> 27:40.400
must have realized that they had to keep a certain core of people in research to deal with problems that were likely to be forthcoming related to the military effort.

27:40.420 --> 27:52.633
And I suppose pretty early was evident about vector-borne diseases, malaria and these sorts of things as it relates back to insecticides.

27:53.373 --> 27:55.580
Not only that, but other things.

27:55.921 --> 28:03.383
Disinfectant, rapid action ones for water, for canteens, for the

28:05.523 --> 28:16.820
dumping it out of the river and some kind of thing to kill off the worst of these beasts in the water so that you could drink it in a short period of time.

28:17.021 --> 28:22.629
So basically then DuPont was in some sort of a cooperative arrangement?

28:22.649 --> 28:25.894
A dollar a year is what they

28:26.262 --> 28:30.586
Was this with the Office of Scientific Research and Development then?

28:30.606 --> 28:31.406
I suspect that's right.

28:31.426 --> 28:41.715
I don't remember the details about which government agencies the contracts were with, but it was by that kind of an emergency organization.

28:41.776 --> 28:42.937
But which one?

28:42.957 --> 28:44.718
I don't recall.

28:44.738 --> 28:49.762
And they would work for a dollar a year for the federal government?

28:49.923 --> 28:52.525
That's what they charge for my services.

28:52.585 --> 28:54.987
In other words, DuPont took care of

28:55.844 --> 29:13.107
My salary and the people that were in my laboratories, including, we soon had to build up a core of scientists that were outside of military aid, women or 4F people or elderly people.

29:13.127 --> 29:24.923
When a lot of these contract jobs came, I say contract, they were paper contacts, we never charged them, but they were contracts to dual service, the armed forces.

29:25.595 --> 29:30.202
And how many researchers did you have?

29:30.282 --> 29:35.089
In the biological side we only had, let's see, one, two, three, three.

29:36.931 --> 29:51.332
One, a very good bacteriologist who had worked, she was one of the early people who had worked with Wachsman, Selma Wachsman on

29:51.700 --> 29:52.502
Antibiotics.

29:53.163 --> 29:56.712
Chloromycin was her doctor's thesis, I believe.

29:56.732 --> 30:05.372
And she also had strong background in bacteriology, which related back to some of this thing like with

30:05.639 --> 30:12.307
compounds for use in disinfecting of water, rapid action ones.

30:12.327 --> 30:18.295
And did the government ask you folks to come up with ideas yourself, or did they have ideas?

30:18.315 --> 30:23.241
Generally they brought the problem and said, do something about it.

30:23.261 --> 30:28.407
And what were some of the problems that you tried to solve?

30:28.673 --> 30:36.244
Far-ranging across a whole series of spectrum of things.

30:38.688 --> 30:50.125
First of all, a lot of them had to do with deterioration of material and equipment under tropical conditions, especially in the South Pacific, and so we rigged up what we called the Jungle Room.

30:50.780 --> 31:05.114
kind of like dripping tropics with high temperatures, full of all kinds of microorganisms that would spray around there.

31:05.834 --> 31:18.246
This was testing all kinds of materials that were being used, including fabrics, camouflage paints, all sorts of things.

31:18.606 --> 31:20.348
You mean fabrics that wouldn't rot?

31:21.577 --> 31:29.343
And then we had another room where they were real soil tests that went into things like sandbags in the tropics where they wouldn't rot.

31:30.985 --> 31:40.953
But also, camouflage from the standpoint of the way the molds would change so that the camouflage was not there.

31:40.993 --> 31:51.482
The cameras would soon pick it up because they'd become stained or the reflection was different than the original that was put on in the paint.

31:51.935 --> 31:52.936
You follow what I mean?

31:52.956 --> 31:53.116
No.

31:53.176 --> 31:54.999
Modified by the action.

31:55.019 --> 31:57.141
No, I don't understand this, really.

31:57.161 --> 32:08.195
Modified by the action of the bacteria or molds, not bacteria, the fungi growing on the camouflage paint that had been put onto the, let's say, the tents.

32:08.435 --> 32:10.197
So this really wasn't a paint down?

32:10.577 --> 32:11.138
What was it?

32:11.198 --> 32:14.122
Some kind of a base that would... No, they were paints.

32:15.003 --> 32:21.030
You see, you'd cook up the camouflage paints and the fabric would go through these vats

32:21.635 --> 32:35.248
you would get patchy, well just like the ordinary camouflage in GI's equipment now, but this was mostly in installation and taints and all of these sorts of things.

32:36.269 --> 32:38.231
And let's see, what were some of the others?

32:39.132 --> 32:40.373
How well did that work?

32:40.393 --> 32:42.174
How well did these camouflage paints work?

32:43.175 --> 32:51.203
Well, they'd soon get in trouble because the planes up there would pick up these things, especially when the molds would grow on them because the

32:51.503 --> 32:54.987
In the early ones, we didn't have any mold stabilizers.

32:55.868 --> 33:00.333
Fungi grow on the oils that were in those paints beautifully.

33:00.974 --> 33:20.397
Same way when the Marines were isolated in Guadalcanal and some of the other South Pacific islands, the Japanese by day controlled both the air and the water.

33:21.507 --> 33:23.510
and the problem was how to supply them.

33:25.814 --> 33:40.660
It so happened that before World War II, all of the bonding agents, the seals that are used in the bottom of cardboard cartons into which you put tin food cans, was made from sodium silicate.

33:41.000 --> 33:43.785
Sodium silicate is pretty soluble in water.

33:44.204 --> 34:09.688
so that once it had been in contact with water why it would open up even though the cardboard of the carton would still have kept it afloat for quite a few hours except for that and I remember the day vividly when somebody came in and said look at this we've got to have something that will hold a bond

34:10.259 --> 34:14.065
I don't remember the hours, but sodium silicate used to come unglued.

34:14.445 --> 34:18.892
The whole cans would fall out of the carton in a few hours.

34:20.374 --> 34:25.822
In other words, the bond was weaker than the cardboard itself.

34:25.842 --> 34:35.095
And they said, we have to have something that's stable in water, and we need it day after yesterday.

34:36.117 --> 34:38.460
And those are the way things worked.

34:39.571 --> 34:45.779
The trouble was that at that time there were orders of priorities for all the raw materials in everything.

34:46.560 --> 34:52.006
You had to have a high enough priority to know which things were worth sampling.

34:55.070 --> 35:04.161
Because it was no good to show that something was satisfactory if you didn't have a priority as far as the job you were on to get the raw materials.

35:04.512 --> 35:09.741
it went to some other division or some other product, and that's the way it was time and again.

35:10.202 --> 35:30.756
So generally you'd have to pick out several, because these priorities would shift also, so that you had a one, two, three, and a fourth choice, depending on how it shook out in the end that the priorities were at the given point when you're ready to use it.

35:31.175 --> 35:35.681
that time some of these polyvinyl alcohols which became plastics.

35:35.721 --> 35:42.529
You see, this was very soon after synthetic fibers came into being.

35:42.569 --> 35:47.255
Nylon was just coming into use as women's stockings when Pearl Harbor came.

35:47.816 --> 35:50.279
They were really not really full commercial.

35:50.740 --> 35:54.645
They were out on, how do you call this, sales development.

35:54.665 --> 35:57.148
Sure, they were selling them but trying to give

35:57.635 --> 36:01.261
records of how long they were served.

36:01.721 --> 36:09.033
They lasted all of this and whether they had a future market.

36:10.515 --> 36:12.538
I remember vividly- Market surveys.

36:12.778 --> 36:13.299
Exactly.

36:14.641 --> 36:17.466
Well, soon there wasn't any nylon for women's stockings.

36:17.706 --> 36:24.216
It was going into one thing, especially into parachutes, because it

36:24.567 --> 36:29.895
could stand the abuse and it was better than any other, relatively light for the strength it had.

36:30.596 --> 36:32.559
And so it was all going in that direction.

36:33.520 --> 36:37.486
And then I remember, I've forgotten what use this was for.

36:37.506 --> 36:46.038
We had to have another lightweight fabric that would do certain things and wouldn't rot.

36:47.200 --> 36:49.503
I've forgotten what the use was.

36:50.144 --> 36:54.270
But anyway, the only synthetic

36:54.740 --> 37:03.911
fiber that is the new ones was nylon, and that was for the parachutes especially.

37:04.872 --> 37:18.469
But cellulose, cellophane, or the fiber that went into what the devil we used to call these?

37:18.489 --> 37:24.696
Synthetic, that is, they were made from wood fiber, viscose process.

37:26.144 --> 37:32.671
the molds would grow on those and they'd destroy it just as fast as they would paper.

37:35.053 --> 37:41.440
But then when it was acidified, when it was cellulose acetate, the molds couldn't touch it.

37:41.940 --> 37:44.203
Well, you soon found out many of these things.

37:44.803 --> 37:55.054
But the cellulose acetate, which is made simply by reacting the viscose before it was spun out in fibers with

37:56.131 --> 38:07.604
Acetic acid made the bond that the molds couldn't attack, but it was very susceptible to many solvents.

38:07.624 --> 38:10.727
Acetone just dissolved in a bunch of goo in your hands.

38:10.787 --> 38:19.497
So there were all kinds of these things that we were feeling around on and for certain uses, some of which I've even forgotten what they were.

38:20.759 --> 38:25.564
One day a tremendous amount of equipment, electrical equipment,

38:26.472 --> 38:38.130
came in in a big box with a colonel and a general from the quartermaster.

38:38.170 --> 38:42.177
This is what's happening out in the field in the South Pacific on our communications.

38:42.257 --> 38:51.772
They were all shorting out from molds again, attacking the insulating coatings that were being used.

38:52.653 --> 38:53.695
So, you'd have to

38:54.265 --> 39:12.731
work with the manufacturer of this and incorporate certain things in or find out what was available and then they would make them up for testing and we would put them into our jungle room and get a reading on them as soon as possible and all sorts of things like this.

39:13.131 --> 39:18.940
But rubber was very short supply.

39:19.280 --> 39:21.403
This was in the

39:21.856 --> 39:26.141
very beginning of plastic.

39:26.161 --> 39:29.625
This must have been kind of exciting now.

39:30.266 --> 39:51.610
Oh I enjoyed it and I learned a great deal about many things and I think that I told you that the first and of course we were working on this malaria problem early started showing up and we had one section in the laboratory working pretty much on

39:52.872 --> 39:54.254
on insecticides.

39:55.195 --> 39:58.719
And one of the test organisms we used was a housefly.

39:59.479 --> 40:02.803
They had become very highly specialized in this.

40:03.985 --> 40:06.447
DuPont sold what was called a synergist.

40:09.531 --> 40:10.412
I've even forgotten.

40:10.612 --> 40:16.218
The IN was never sold under a trade name.

40:16.239 --> 40:18.801
The IN, because it never went to the consumer.

40:18.882 --> 40:21.985
It went to those who fabricated the insecticides.

40:22.994 --> 40:49.452
At that time, most of the insecticides used for controlling household insects, especially flies and mosquitoes, was a pyrethrum-based natural insecticide from the petals of the pyrethrum plant, which became in short supply very soon also because it was produced mostly in Africa.

40:50.794 --> 40:52.056
And then to this,

40:52.475 --> 40:57.901
We would add this IM, whatever it was, 370 or something.

40:58.021 --> 40:59.202
I've forgotten the code number.

40:59.823 --> 41:06.871
And it would increase the efficiency of this very greatly, especially the knockdown or the paralytic effect.

41:08.052 --> 41:13.699
When you added this to the pyrethrum base, why the knockdown on the flies was fantastically different.

41:13.979 --> 41:18.844
So sort of an early type of off or one of those, one of the, was it a parasol?

41:19.024 --> 41:19.745
It wasn't a repellent.

41:19.765 --> 41:20.406
Oh, it wasn't a repellent?

41:20.707 --> 41:28.254
But the first aerosols were done in this laboratory when we got going on the, a little later, on DDT.

41:28.975 --> 41:30.456
Oh, well, how did this work?

41:30.476 --> 41:31.938
How did this stuff from Africa work?

41:33.239 --> 41:35.421
The one to go with the pyrethrum base?

41:36.182 --> 41:36.282
Yeah.

41:36.302 --> 41:39.425
Well, until we ran out of that.

41:39.445 --> 41:40.586
What was the name of it?

41:40.606 --> 41:42.247
It never had a great name.

41:42.267 --> 41:43.388
It was an IN.

41:43.669 --> 41:49.274
The way I remember was 370.

41:49.334 --> 41:50.595
That doesn't sound quite right.

41:51.082 --> 41:57.528
But anyway, IN was the DuPont code number of experimental compounds.

41:57.548 --> 42:00.030
And it never reached the consumer per se.

42:00.251 --> 42:09.219
It was sold to an insecticide company that manufactured fly or mosquito control agents.

42:09.239 --> 42:15.425
Many of DuPont's chemicals then, and I think even today, are not sold direct to consumers.

42:15.585 --> 42:19.789
They're ingredients that goes into manufacturers.

42:19.955 --> 42:27.929
And these are supposed to keep these bugs off of our men in Southeast Asia, our South Pacific young.

42:27.949 --> 42:36.765
Then one day, and of course during this period there was a new crisis every few days.

42:37.266 --> 42:37.566
War.

42:38.268 --> 42:38.728
Exactly.

42:39.269 --> 42:42.435
And suddenly, oh I guess this was

42:47.849 --> 42:52.414
I don't remember, I suppose it was 73 or late 72.

42:56.539 --> 43:09.535
There was a great to-do in the meeting, and here was this compound that had come from ICI under some code name.

43:09.575 --> 43:11.718
They didn't know what it was either at that time.

43:11.858 --> 43:12.839
Oh, it was ICI.

43:13.460 --> 43:15.342
Imperial Chemicals Limited.

43:15.811 --> 43:39.253
industry limited of Britain and it so happened that a few months before on the Eastern Front in Russia between Russia and I suppose Poland there was a hell of an outbreak of typhus among the Soviets but the Germans weren't infested

43:41.326 --> 43:48.793
And then they took a few prisoners and they found a little pill box with some powder in it in their uniform.

43:48.813 --> 43:56.059
A few days later the Russians pushed up and overran a little mixing plant where they were mixing this stuff.

43:56.079 --> 44:03.386
And they took back quite a few pounds of it to Moscow and divided and kept half and sent half to ICI.

44:04.087 --> 44:05.808
They divided and sent part to us.

44:06.949 --> 44:11.113
And this turned out to be DDT.

44:12.022 --> 44:19.913
Of course, in a short time, our chemists, maybe elsewhere they traced it too, but we were the first to produce it.

44:22.337 --> 44:40.864
Both the chemists or specialists really in synthesizing things, they've got some uncanny extra senses, including things like smell and

44:41.975 --> 45:09.265
taste and all of these things to complement the data of the reactions and how they go and then of course through the patents they're always tracing this too and they think they got a lead on something and in a very short period of time they knew that this was a compound that was patented by Geige several years before in Switzerland and it was tested not on mosquitoes

45:09.886 --> 45:14.551
but of all things, the clothes moth that destroys woolen clothing.

45:17.233 --> 45:24.120
So the Germans then had been manufacturing this, the DDT, that they originally got from a Swiss patent?

45:24.640 --> 45:25.821
I expect so.

45:26.102 --> 45:29.024
They never knew the mechanics or all the details there.

45:29.044 --> 45:33.088
And the Americans weren't... Weren't using it, weren't testing it even.

45:33.108 --> 45:36.071
But knew that it existed because of the patent, the Swiss patent?

45:36.972 --> 45:38.914
Yes, and so...

45:39.046 --> 45:49.116
In a short period of time, then they started testing it in our lab, and then one USDA lab down in Florida, where they had, we tested it on quite a few insects.

45:49.957 --> 46:01.028
In Florida, they'd already been testing certain other chemicals for mosquito, larval control, especially, mostly in the larval states.

46:02.270 --> 46:04.632
And we worked closely with them.

46:05.422 --> 46:15.685
And in a short period of time, it became apparent that this was very effective on the whole range of insects, including vector-borne diseases other than
