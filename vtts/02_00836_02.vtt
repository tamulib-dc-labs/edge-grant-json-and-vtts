WEBVTT

00:01.533 --> 00:06.237
And he took him everywhere he went with him. He went 
and took my father. And because he was a

00:10.180 --> 00:19.328
sharpshooter in the Army, he was discharged six 
months ahead of time. And he went on home, back to

00:20.349 --> 00:25.433
his hometown and married my mother. And stayed 
there a very little short while.

00:32.380 --> 00:42.533
They decided

00:32.380 --> 00:42.533
to come to the United States because the taxes were 
so high in a way they couldn't hardly live with what

00:32.380 --> 00:42.533
little they were making. And they had to pay so much 
duties and different things for different kinds

00:43.474 --> 00:49.041
of taxes that they just couldn't make it. So they 
moved to Louisiana, landed in New Orleans. And

00:56.390 --> 01:01.797
they had one little girl. They brought from Italy, 
and one of them, I mean, the only one that was born in

01:02.570 --> 01:09.041
Italy that came to him came to Louisiana. And they 
worked in the cane fields.

01:14.590 --> 01:21.541
The day, they put in about anywhere from 12 to maybe 
11 hours a day, and then at night, 50 cents a day. And

01:22.082 --> 01:29.674
then at night, he would go work at the sugar mill, 
and the sugar mill, they paid him 50 cents until 12

01:22.082 --> 01:29.674
o'clock at night. And the next morning, of course, 
he had to go back to work at 6 o'clock. He had a

01:34.883 --> 01:40.050
brother-in-law here in Bryan that was farming. He 
probably had his own land at the time, but I don't

01:40.231 --> 01:43.375
remember whether he did or not. But anyway, they 
asked him to come move in Bryan with him. So when

01:48.002 --> 02:00.319
they got to Bryan, they started farming on 
different places on 3rd and 4th, I mean on Havas,

01:48.002 --> 02:00.319
until they was able to buy him some mule. And then he 
went to work on third and fourth, what they call.

02:07.515 --> 02:19.413
I guess what it was, the corn, the owner of the land 
got one-third, and the man that was working the

02:07.515 --> 02:19.413
land got two-thirds. And the cotton, they got 
three-fourths, and the man that owned the land got

02:19.433 --> 02:28.045
a fourth. So he worked like that from one place to 
another. He just missed the 99 flood. He was in what

02:33.826 --> 02:40.475
they call right at the bottom around Copy Bridge 
somewhere. I have never been able to locate where

02:40.495 --> 02:46.303
they did live because actually they didn't go back 
there for a long time. I don't doubt whether they

02:46.323 --> 02:49.547
ever went back there. So they moved just ahead of 
the flood, and they worked... farmed until 1902,

02:57.337 --> 03:03.803
renting land and farming them third and fourth. 
And in 1902, we bought a farm. I was born in 1900, and

03:07.486 --> 03:13.451
then when I was two years old, we bought this farm. 
It was between, on Dilly Short there, between two

03:13.471 --> 03:18.436
weeks and creeks. And I stayed with him and went 
part of the time, went to school, and part-time

03:19.757 --> 03:26.483
worked with him in the field. until we paid the 
land, by the way, in a couple of years. And we had a

03:30.690 --> 03:46.987
very good friend of the family of the Carrabbas and 
the Whittyards who were akin to us with a man named

03:30.690 --> 03:46.987
Sam Parker Sr. And he loaned us the money to buy the 
land. And in a couple of years, we had it paid for. So

03:52.233 --> 03:55.997
I went on from then on until I was gone and went We 
moved to Dallas one time. I might mention this

03:58.769 --> 04:09.060
ahead of before, but we moved to Dallas and 
Memphis, Tennessee and Memphis, Tennessee,

03:58.769 --> 04:09.060
because we had a lot of snow and the boys couldn't 
get no jobs. We stayed there about a month and went

04:09.381 --> 04:12.925
back and moved to Dallas and opened a grocery 
store. And since the my brother was old enough to

04:14.286 --> 04:23.397
begin to notice girls, they forgot about the store 
and left me and my dad around. My dad couldn't speak

04:23.457 --> 04:24.718
English. And I was too young to run the store, so we 
was just about to go broke, and we decided to come

04:25.357 --> 04:32.143
back to Brian. So we lost a whole year's crop, plus 
about $2,000 for the trip and back. But anyway, we

04:39.710 --> 04:44.654
come back and got our land back. And the man that we 
rented the land to made the biggest crop that would

04:45.295 --> 04:49.098
have been made in that place. I think he made 39 or 49 
bales. I don't remember. So we lost that crop. Then

04:53.875 --> 04:55.377
we had to buy a team again. And when we left, we sold 
it for nothing. Then they'd buy new again, and it

05:02.305 --> 05:05.729
cost us quite a bit of money. But anyway, I think I 
mentioned this before. My mother was very

05:09.053 --> 05:11.516
conservative, and she had $4,000. No one knew but 
her. And we took that $4,000 and bought all our

05:13.719 --> 05:22.870
teams and got started back in the little cattle 
business, which You would buy a calf then for about

05:23.069 --> 05:29.099
three and a half, four dollars, a pig for about two 
and a half, three or four dollars. And then in 1920,

05:30.561 --> 05:42.500
my

05:30.561 --> 05:42.500
brother married in 1919, and I got married in 1920. 
And

05:42.680 --> 05:48.790
I farmed three years after that, after I'd gotten 
married. Two years in my father-in-law's place,

05:49.833 --> 05:53.038
who was Lou Bridgetti. And one year in John 
Grover's place. And I made the best crop there in

05:57.925 --> 06:03.112
this place that I ever made in all these rest of the 
two years.

06:05.856 --> 06:16.431
And right around 1923, I think it was probably 
September or October, I moved in town. And I went to

06:17.913 --> 06:23.640
work for Lawrence Grocery Company, worked for 
them 26 or 27 years. And then Lawrence Grocery

06:24.621 --> 06:27.945
Company, of course, I might have mentioned this 
before, they sold out. And I went to work for

06:29.167 --> 06:33.032
Kimball. And I've always wanted a retail grocery 
store. And I worked for Kimball, and it wasn't a

06:37.337 --> 06:42.023
very satisfactory position. I was a salesman, by 
the way.

06:47.191 --> 06:58.666
I had my vacation coming, and I told the boss that I 
was quitting, but I wanted to take my vacation that

06:47.191 --> 06:58.666
I had coming, which was two weeks. And I took 10 days 
of it and went to California to see my sister. And

07:04.333 --> 07:14.025
from there, we bought this store, which was on 25th 
and San Jacinto.

07:15.541 --> 07:24.953
We stayed there and by that time the Army Air Base 
opened again and we'd done fairly good business

07:15.541 --> 07:24.953
and made a little extra money.

07:27.837 --> 07:34.746
Did

07:27.837 --> 07:34.746
you have any trouble getting this first job 
because of being Italian? No, I did not because The

07:37.563 --> 07:43.531
only, because there's a couple of friends of mine, 
John Collette and Jack Shimon, who were real good

07:37.563 --> 07:43.531
friends of mine. Well, in fact, we were a little bit 
kin, kind of distant kin. And they were trading

07:46.975 --> 07:51.261
with Lawrence Grocery Company, and they asked Mr. 
Lawrence if they needed a man. I wanted to move to

07:51.922 --> 07:52.983
town. It was very easy. I went, the boss 
interviewed me and showed me all that heavy stuff I

07:54.485 --> 07:59.132
had to live. But through a good friend of mine 
there, I didn't do much of that. He finally got to

08:02.656 --> 08:04.819
liking me, and I... He gave me an easy job, finally 
became an assistant shipping clerk. He was a

08:12.291 --> 08:13.192
shipping clerk. And from then he quit and I got his 
job and was making a little more money. But you talk

08:19.059 --> 08:34.857
about discrimination, I probably said this back 
there before, that there's always been a little

08:19.059 --> 08:34.857
discrimination between most any of the, in this 
part of the country you find discrimination

08:19.059 --> 08:34.857
against Italians, In the other parts of the 
country, you might find discrimination against

08:35.242 --> 08:42.789
the Polish or the Bohemians or whoever you want to 
call it. But still, now, you can notice that there

08:42.809 --> 08:54.741
still is a little discrimination when it comes to 
election, when it comes to social affairs. Well,

08:54.781 --> 09:02.548
most times, you can notice a little 
discrimination, even today. But it's not like it

09:03.423 --> 09:16.185
was because there's business interest innocent 
to the fact that we want their business and they

09:03.423 --> 09:16.185
want our business. And they don't show it as bad.

09:21.154 --> 09:23.798
After all, you know, we're all foreigners in this 
country. You know, she was born in England and came

09:25.681 --> 09:27.745
down here. But anyway, we're still foreigners. 
And they just, because they happened to come here a

09:29.663 --> 09:38.175
little bit before we did or before the other guy 
did, there's no sense in it. And as far as

09:38.195 --> 09:46.967
discrimination with the black people, we had them 
working for us on the farm, and we played ball. I

09:47.027 --> 09:48.429
belonged to the team. There was three of us, me and 
myself and two brothers, and the rest of them was

09:48.609 --> 09:54.638
black. We were playing baseball. How'd you do? We 
done fine. We got along fine. Never had a bit of

09:59.161 --> 10:01.524
trouble with them, either of them today. Very few 
of them live in, I think, one of the guys that still

10:02.666 --> 10:15.365
live in is Sun Bell, who has resigned from the city 
council just this year. And we're still friends.

10:20.433 --> 10:23.397
I invited him to my house one time to come watch TV, 
and he He wanted to go around the back door. I said,

10:25.539 --> 10:26.880
no, you come in the front door. I said, that front 
door is open for anybody, any of my friends. And he

10:30.724 --> 10:32.606
never did forget that. It was the first time I'd 
been in a white man's house. He said I didn't have to

10:36.570 --> 10:38.612
go in from the back door. But it's not, the 
discrimination now is not too bad with the Italian

10:39.313 --> 10:47.501
people or different nationalities. There's 
still a lot of discrimination with the blacks. Is

10:50.324 --> 10:53.147
there a large Italian population here in Bryan? 
Oh, it was, but most people, as they got married,

10:53.245 --> 11:02.038
there were no jobs for them here because Bryan was 
rather small. They would all move to Houston.

11:04.161 --> 11:10.391
Sometimes I think that 90% of the Italian people in 
Houston come from Bryan. Of course, now all the old

11:10.571 --> 11:14.697
folks have passed away. Sometimes I feel like I'm 
about the oldest one in the Italian race.

11:21.114 --> 11:22.416
Descent's here, but I'm not. It's two older than I 
am. But my brother, he's 87 years old. And then

11:27.403 --> 11:30.307
there's an old man, Mr. John Palisotto. He's 92, I 
believe. And, of course, I'm going to be 76 in

11:34.453 --> 11:38.839
August. And I'm getting

11:38.859 --> 11:44.067
up to the age. I don't know why. I don't know 
anything else I could tell you. Do you have any

11:51.175 --> 11:52.117
plans? Do I have any plans? Yeah. My only plan now is 
mostly, I'm not saying this boasting or anything,

11:54.902 --> 12:05.280
is serving God and working with the church. That's 
all I want. Most of that's my biggest job. Go there

12:10.109 --> 12:11.211
and... straighten out things for them in the 
evening, get ready for the morning, for the night

12:11.832 --> 12:16.138
service. We have service at 7 o'clock. And I have 
everything ready for the priest as they come in

12:19.002 --> 12:22.126
now. All they have to do is start with the service. 
And take care of the countenance, the board of

12:24.770 --> 12:29.517
countenance over the call. And they don't have to 
worry about anything. And I just love doing it.

12:33.402 --> 12:41.113
Then I usher every Sunday, every Saturday evening 
at 7 o'clock, then Sunday at 7 o'clock. And one

12:42.123 --> 12:46.008
thing they won't trust me is with the money. They do 
their own counting. They have a bunch of counts of

12:47.690 --> 12:49.633
money. And every collection, every service, you 
know, they have a collection. And not each one

12:54.939 --> 12:56.982
count their own money. But I don't count any of the 
other money, nor the night, because I don't have

12:57.002 --> 13:01.167
time. Because I've got to be cleaning up after they 
get through, put stuff away, and get it out of the

13:01.207 --> 13:08.497
way for the day. They may have a way with something. 
And my plans are

13:12.143 --> 13:25.283
just living and trying to live the best peaceful 
life I can and wait for the good Lord to come home,

13:12.143 --> 13:25.283
boy. That's about all I know, unless you want to ask 
me anything else. No, I think that'll be it. Thank

13:35.959 --> 13:38.202
you very much.
