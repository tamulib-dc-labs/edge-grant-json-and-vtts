Share with me any recollections you have and or any 
thoughts you think Dr. Williams would have had

00:04.722 --> 00:14.173
about some of these special people. Ed Cooper, who 
was his assistant for many years. Ed was a good

00:20.340 --> 00:21.462
assistant. He would have thought Ed was a good 
assistant. And he would ask him to do anything, I

00:24.645 --> 00:26.888
believe. Do you remember any Cooper stories? Any 
stories about Cooper and Things that he and Dr.

00:32.313 --> 00:33.895
Williams... I remember the last thing I heard 
about him. What's that? Cut it off. Oh, no. Go

00:39.041 --> 00:39.462
ahead. Go ahead. About something else then. You 
know, I told you a while ago about Williams is out

00:42.766 --> 00:46.390
and Jarvis is in. Oh, mm-hmm.

00:50.495 --> 00:58.525
Do you remember any

00:50.495 --> 00:58.525
stories about things that Dr. Williams asked Ed to 
do? Any assignments he gave him? I gave him one

01:01.372 --> 01:02.553
early. That was to look after his mother when they 
had the musical and the reception down at Bryan.

01:08.240 --> 01:15.468
And when they first came, Ed was the one he asked to 
take care of his mother because he and I were in the

01:08.240 --> 01:15.468
receiving line. But Ed evidently just did 
anything they asked. And I can't... I wasn't that

01:25.098 --> 01:28.841
close to what Jack was having people do. I was sort 
of closed off because I didn't try to be a part of his

01:29.862 --> 01:37.629
work, only when he included me. All right, now, who 
do you think were the closest confidants,

01:38.530 --> 01:49.039
trustees of Dr. Williams when he was at A&M? Who did 
he trust most when he... listen to or to give an

01:53.836 --> 01:56.080
assignment to? Who would have been the people that 
he trusted most? I don't think he would have had one

02:00.547 --> 02:03.212
person singled out. No, no, but who were in the 
group? Well, his staff. But which one? I don't

02:07.860 --> 02:10.083
know. He would have asked many more. He would have 
just taken everybody. His philosophy was give

02:13.609 --> 02:18.558
that person their job, pick the best person you 
can. You've heard this before. Let them do their

02:21.258 --> 02:22.442
job. Now, you probably were closer to who he was 
using than I was because he didn't come home and

02:22.923 --> 02:30.950
recount the events of the day. I sometimes 
overheard For instance, when we lived here, I

02:34.690 --> 02:46.282
didn't know what he was doing until we went out to 
his head of his department for a happy hour, and

02:34.690 --> 02:46.282
Carl would be dying laughing and repeating what he 
had found out that Jack was doing. But I wouldn't

02:46.523 --> 02:48.845
have known if I hadn't listened to Carl. He just 
didn't come home and say, I did this today or did

02:49.606 --> 02:53.590
that. But like I know that John Calhoun and John 
Colas and Ed Cooper... He would have talked to them

03:00.437 --> 03:03.921
if it related to their work. That's when he would 
have approached him about what had to be done. But I

03:08.648 --> 03:14.593
don't think, I know he got up and went to people's 
office to talk to them. He didn't send for you.

03:19.778 --> 03:22.501
Did he come to your office? A few times, yes, ma'am. 
He didn't send for you, though, did he?

03:26.785 --> 03:27.326
Occasionally. Did he? Occasionally. Like that 
day on the law school and the medical school. And

03:31.950 --> 03:34.853
when we walked in, he was grinning, and we kind of 
like, uh-oh. This one's going to be fun. It was not a

03:37.518 --> 03:38.620
mean grin. It was like, okay. You're here. You're 
happy. Happy Jack. Smiling Jack. Now, was he,

03:44.308 --> 03:47.793
where did that nickname begin? Do you know? With 
the students, Smiling Jack. Here at Clemson?

03:52.479 --> 03:52.920
Okay. In his Cowboys and Indians course. He taught 
the opening of the West, and they called it Cowboys

03:55.784 --> 04:00.030
and Indians. Of the courses he taught, which one do 
you, which course or courses do you think he

04:00.517 --> 04:06.023
enjoyed most? Don't have any idea. Okay. Do you 
know of any that he taught that he didn't enjoy? No.

04:13.170 --> 04:16.333
What did he like most about teaching? Why did he? I 
don't know. I know he was the type of person that

04:20.357 --> 04:24.061
wanted to be a good teacher. When he went off to get 
his doctorate, he destroyed all of his lecture

04:24.341 --> 04:30.287
notes. He said, I'm not going to be the kind of 
professor that writes one set of lectures and then

04:31.499 --> 04:37.446
uses them forever. And so when he came back, he set a 
time limit for himself.

04:45.735 --> 04:54.385
We came back in spring, and he had to do his 
research. And then he taught, and he had to write

04:55.765 --> 05:01.533
all those lectures over at the same time he was 
writing his dissertation. But I don't think he, he

05:02.214 --> 05:07.201
hadn't realized that was going to happen to him, 
but he did it. Now what was his dissertation topic?

05:15.493 --> 05:18.177
Crime and Punishment in the Old South. Okay. I've 
been trying to remember the two times that

05:19.778 --> 05:28.978
something excited me till I couldn't go to sleep, 
and I can only remember one of them. And it was two

05:29.971 --> 05:44.666
things that he did that excited me, and it 
certainly wasn't when we moved on to another job,

05:29.971 --> 05:44.666
but the first one was when the word came that the 
University of South Carolina was going to publish

05:29.971 --> 05:44.666
his dissertation. Now that just excited me 
because I had lived through every bit of it. But

05:50.392 --> 05:55.017
I've been trying to remember what was the other 
thing that was just that exciting something that

05:56.414 --> 06:01.459
pleased him, obviously, something that, but I 
can't remember. Now, was he excited about the news

06:02.040 --> 06:05.703
that it was going to be published? He never acted 
excited about anything. He'd make a statement and

06:09.767 --> 06:14.672
that was it, and he never, you know, made a big deal 
out of anything. And one of the schools, the

06:15.313 --> 06:24.342
colleges or schools in this state used his 
dissertation as their textbook as how to write

06:15.313 --> 06:24.342
one. Have you ever seen it? Oh, yes. Who would have 
been, if I were to ask him about who his role models

06:29.926 --> 06:38.537
were for good teaching, reckon who he would say? 
Who were his models for being a good teacher? I

06:44.705 --> 06:45.646
don't have any idea. I wonder, was Bell Wiley one? I 
don't have any idea. Who...

06:50.252 --> 06:55.378
What... administrators were his. Andy Holt? They 
were friends. He enjoyed Andy. I don't have any

07:02.798 --> 07:05.161
idea. You know, he did so much for Southern 
Association that he had been exposed to an awful

07:05.201 --> 07:19.662
lot of people and Jack was always an officer and 
everything that he got near before it was over.

07:20.114 --> 07:23.239
That doesn't sound very nice for me to say, but it 
happened. You know, ministering or getting

07:24.420 --> 07:28.526
things done, I think, showed up. Other people 
recognized it. Excuse me. He had many, many

07:34.695 --> 07:41.265
stories that he used in his speeches and 
everything. And I have made notes about some of

07:42.286 --> 07:48.315
those that I have used over and over again. What do 
you think were some of his favorite stories that he

07:48.852 --> 07:56.604
enjoyed telling in his speeches? The only one I 
remember was he did quote Thurber. He quoted

08:02.793 --> 08:07.620
Thurber several times.

08:09.237 --> 08:12.741
The Barrel of Bricks story. And that's the only 
ones I know. Do you know where the Barrel of Bricks

08:15.004 --> 08:20.632
story came from, where it originated? No, no. But 
I've seen him get up and change his introduction.

08:25.878 --> 08:32.146
At Emory & Henry one time, a student got up to speak 
before he did. He was being honored that day.

08:36.794 --> 08:45.589
She got up and told a negative story about 
something that the students didn't like.

08:47.425 --> 08:55.673
He got up and changed his introduction to quote 
Thurber about somebody that got eaten for dinner.

08:55.713 --> 09:00.397
I've forgotten how the story went, but I could see 
how quick he could make a change in a story. And I

09:00.417 --> 09:12.028
recognized it, that he got up and changed it 
completely to start his speech, just to refer back

09:00.417 --> 09:12.028
with a Thurber story on what he had thought of what 
that child did. When he was going to make a formal

09:13.129 --> 09:16.032
speech, These are not just remarks. This is a 
formal speech. Did he write it out word for word, or

09:19.445 --> 09:23.711
did he have an outline? He had different ways. He 
had note cards. For years, he taught students here

09:27.477 --> 09:30.963
in church. Then he taught the senior class, the 
adult class. And he would get his lesson up a week

09:34.809 --> 09:43.302
before time, put it on cards, and then he wouldn't 
take the cards out of his pocket. Now, this was at

09:44.969 --> 09:46.392
what church? Methodist. He wouldn't take the 
cards out. And I would sit there hoping. But he

09:51.182 --> 09:53.927
says, if you've written it, you know it. And I have 
found that to be true. The little speech I was going

09:56.332 --> 10:03.366
to make for the ceremony out there...

10:05.152 --> 10:11.039
After I wrote it, I could have given it without any 
notes, and probably I wanted to give Jo something.

10:11.760 --> 10:16.086
I want her to see those pictures of the ceremony so 
she can see Dalton.

10:19.049 --> 10:20.691
No, the time... I don't want this on there. Turn it 
off. He'd been teaching in the classroom and in the

10:26.579 --> 10:34.669
church, and he always read when he died... He had 
given the chairman of his board a book, and the

10:34.970 --> 10:45.106
chairman came out and said, I've read more than he 
did because Jack had the same book. And I didn't

10:45.126 --> 10:47.530
say, no, but Jack was reading three books. But he 
read all the time, and he had grown up reading, and

10:48.932 --> 10:56.945
he was just that type of a person. He had great 
pleasure in it.

11:02.459 --> 11:06.123
Now, he just loved Thurber, all the Thurber 
stories. He could relate to those.

11:10.508 --> 11:12.971
But he also read serious things. But he could write 
his speeches, and if you'd written your speech,

11:13.291 --> 11:18.036
then you could give it without notes. Do you 
remember any time when he

11:18.557 --> 11:28.568
forgot to get a speech ready or he took the wrong 
notes? You wouldn't have been with him the time

11:29.729 --> 11:36.940
that he was with the Aggies. I think I've told you 
this.

11:42.770 --> 11:45.033
Buck Wires said, Jack, I don't know what you can do. 
This is in a gymnasium, and it's a family affair.

11:52.325 --> 11:55.770
People have come and brought their families, 
their children here in the audience. And he said it

11:56.223 --> 11:58.666
was the most remarkable thing he had. Buck told me 
this person, most remarkable thing I've ever

11:58.947 --> 12:02.011
seen. He got up and gave the lessons of history. He 
gave them a history lesson. And he said everybody

12:06.617 --> 12:08.860
was quiet and everybody listened. Now, was that 
his delivery? He wouldn't have had any notes. But

12:16.611 --> 12:17.773
you ought to see that book. Now, it's marked up. and 
but he'd write to here and then he'd write to page so

12:20.995 --> 12:37.013
and so in a book and you know he could outline it in in 
the book and i have them in my fireproof safe now one

12:20.995 --> 12:37.013
of my favorite williams memories also is that 
letter from the person in West Texas that said, I

12:37.887 --> 12:41.872
couldn't believe they'd picked you. You're not an 
Aggie? You're not an Aggie. And I use that quite

12:44.416 --> 12:46.278
often. I give... But don't tell them that he made it 
up now. No, no, no, I don't. I tell them that it is a

12:51.345 --> 12:57.073
story, it is a letter that I heard him quote quite 
often. Well, that's what he did. He went to

12:58.075 --> 13:04.283
Buckwires with it, after he composed it, and said, 
now this sort of covers that problem. And I thought

13:04.263 --> 13:06.567
it was clever, didn't you? Oh, it always went over 
speed. Yeah, it was clever. You've heard it. And

13:10.494 --> 13:17.526
with groups today, I use it quite often to... 
You're not an Aggie, but I'll watch you damn close.

13:17.606 --> 13:24.398
And one lady one time, I was standing close enough 
to her, and she said, I wonder why he said close.

13:24.682 --> 13:26.625
Instead of closely, you know. And the other one 
said, I guess he wrote it, I guess it was written the

13:26.645 --> 13:31.291
way he talked. That's right, that's right. But I 
could hear, sometimes you hear things, you know,

13:33.514 --> 13:42.787
if they don't realize that you're, but no, don't 
tell me that he composed that to make a point. I

13:43.368 --> 13:47.895
thought it was better than saying I'm not an Aggie, 
but I'll do the best I can. That's great. When y'all

13:48.661 --> 13:59.758
traveled, what was his favorite place or places 
for y'all to visit for relaxation, other than

13:48.661 --> 13:59.758
visiting family? Were there any favorite 
vacation spots?

14:05.146 --> 14:06.689
No, we toured some. We took our children, went to 
Canada, took our children and went out to Outer

14:06.729 --> 14:13.279
Banks of North Carolina. We went in to see one of the 
out north place they had up there on the coast. You

14:22.799 --> 14:23.801
said Hawaii. He wanted to take me. We never got 
there. Oh, you never got there. We never got there.

14:28.930 --> 14:33.719
Disaster struck both times, and Betty was afraid 
that I'd never go after Jack died. But they

14:33.959 --> 14:36.083
arranged for Mary for me to go. and share their 
facilities. No, he wanted to move there when the

14:41.110 --> 14:47.139
war was over, but he said to me, he said, I just 
couldn't do it to your parents. And he never went

14:48.000 --> 14:50.523
back to Saipan after? No, no. He never went back to 
Hawaii. But he wanted to live there because he just

14:55.655 --> 15:01.783
loved it because of the weather, because of the 
breeze, really. He just loved the fact that if it

15:04.026 --> 15:10.475
rained, the breeze dried you off in a few minutes, 
and it was always this wonderful weather. Now, as I

15:11.517 --> 15:21.190
look back at the notes I made, I remember that 1976, 
we were looking forward to it on the campus as the

15:11.517 --> 15:21.190
centennial. And all of those great plans were 
marred by his heart problems. Were there any

15:27.970 --> 15:31.176
warnings before that heart attack? Sure. Is that 
right? They started here. Is that right? He was

15:36.124 --> 15:39.369
misdiagnosed. And the

15:39.389 --> 15:45.118
doctor said it was. hyperglycemia. But Jack had 
had trouble for years. And that's the reason, when

15:51.640 --> 15:54.945
we lived in College Station, people didn't know 
it. But I did all the grocery shopping. I did our

15:56.527 --> 15:57.789
meals. I wasn't going to let anybody cook for him. 
And that got me in trouble with Juanita, who

16:01.295 --> 16:05.742
resented the fact that I couldn't. But I thought 
that she liked to make fattening casseroles. And

16:10.670 --> 16:12.793
that wasn't the way I fed my husband. So what foods 
did you try to avoid from his diet? Well, just heavy

16:19.748 --> 16:24.176
calories, you know, a balanced diet. Fruit, 
vegetables, meat. By this time, I think I'd

16:27.963 --> 16:32.250
stopped frying chicken. Could he, if he wanted to, 
privately have a glass of wine or a glass of beer?

16:38.083 --> 16:39.605
Until he got on his medication. When he got on his 
medication, it gave him diarrhea. That was after

16:43.649 --> 16:45.772
the heart attack? Uh-huh. And that was an 
experimental drug, you know, that he was on. But he

16:48.775 --> 16:50.297
could have a... But he didn't drink. Two drinks 
would have knocked him out, I think. He was very

16:54.942 --> 16:57.325
sensitive to alcohol. Now, the heart attack came 
in March, right?

17:03.854 --> 17:05.899
It was a holiday weekend. He went up to make an 
address at Emory & Henry. It must have been in the

17:10.932 --> 17:14.021
spring because he made an address. He'd already 
been to the doctor and college station. And he went

17:17.189 --> 17:19.956
up and made his speech. And then I saw him go in and 
take a step around the corner and take a pill,

17:20.408 --> 17:28.483
because they were giving us a tour of the campus. 
And then we were supposed to go to see his mother,

17:28.503 --> 17:31.789
and I begged him just to go home. And we got over to 
his mother. He said, mother's expecting me. It's

17:35.576 --> 17:36.377
so lucky. Got over there, and we went out to eat 
again. And he ordered country ham.

17:46.126 --> 17:52.636
And I was trying my best from the other end of the 
table to catch his eye, and I didn't manage, so he

17:46.126 --> 17:52.636
ate another heavy meal. And so when we got back to 
his mother's house, I made an excuse and said, we

17:53.979 --> 18:00.809
have to go to bed. We went to bed, and he went to 
sleep, and I lay there all night long like this,

18:02.292 --> 18:08.041
with my hand touching his heart. The next morning, 
he got up, went down. I said, tell your mother that

18:11.707 --> 18:13.770
Margaret I don't remember where I told her I had a 
kidney stone or what, that we might have to leave

18:14.493 --> 18:18.317
suddenly. I was afraid to leave. It was a holiday 
weekend. And I knew if we canceled our plane and

18:21.421 --> 18:26.446
tried to get on an early one, we might be out and not 
have anything. We got back, and I said, let's go to

18:27.007 --> 18:30.170
the hospital, and we got off the plane in Houston. 
He said, no, I've got to go look after my business.

18:32.693 --> 18:36.637
I've got to go Dallas tomorrow or something like 
that. So we went to the house, and he called the

18:36.657 --> 18:40.922
doctor, and they said, get down here as fast as you 
can. And he went to the office and answered his

18:41.847 --> 18:44.911
mail.

18:48.036 --> 18:48.917
Because he's so like him. And then we drove down 
there. And I went back to take care of the dog, as

18:52.903 --> 18:55.787
I've told you before. And on Wednesday, the doctor 
called me up and said he's either had a heart

18:55.847 --> 19:00.674
attack. I have the piece of paper where he listed 
every time he had a pain and the time and the

19:01.034 --> 19:06.302
duration. And when the doctor came in the next day, 
he called me and said, I'm taking him to intensive

19:07.278 --> 19:11.584
care. He's either had a heart attack or he's having 
one. But you see what I'm saying is you couldn't

19:16.430 --> 19:22.619
stop him from doing what he thought he needed to do, 
and he could have died. Now, did Dr. DeBakey assist

19:22.659 --> 19:27.745
while you all were in Houston? He was on Jack's case 
and had every doctor in Houston on the case. That's

19:31.991 --> 19:32.432
what I thought. And he would not let Jack die. He 
saved his life, and he operated on him. And

19:37.687 --> 19:47.402
it was a long time before Jack was, you know, was 
awake. And when he was awake, he was awake. You

19:49.345 --> 19:51.789
know, it wasn't that he was mentally gone. He was 
just unconscious all that time. Because it was a

19:56.517 --> 19:58.620
month or so, wasn't it? It was a good while. It was 
years. But when he woke up, it's like John Calhoun,

20:01.615 --> 20:12.047
his great assistant told people not to come to see 
him. You know who that was.

20:17.894 --> 20:25.362
Anyway, John Calhoun came over and Jack was 
discussing the university business with him.

20:27.586 --> 20:34.619
He went back and said, well, he's just talking 
about everything like he did before, and it didn't

20:27.586 --> 20:34.619
seem to have, all that time didn't seem to have 
bothered him. There's no brain damage. which was,

20:36.327 --> 20:40.573
you know, the hospital, it seemed to that. But I had 
the paper that was written on his condition by one

20:41.995 --> 20:56.114
of the graduate students there at the hospital, 
and his whole case was published in one of the

20:41.995 --> 20:56.114
medical magazines or whatever it was. You don't 
call them magazines, you call them... One of the

20:56.795 --> 21:00.040
journals? Yeah, a journal. But it was... But I 
found out in 1955 about this. When Murray was six

21:10.082 --> 21:15.046
months old that this was a heart condition, but it 
was big diagnosed. And when he went to the doctor

21:15.066 --> 21:19.270
over on the campus, he still didn't catch it. When 
he went to the dentist with the pain in his jaw, the

21:19.290 --> 21:22.713
dentist didn't catch it. And

21:23.934 --> 21:28.819
Jack could keep going regardless. It's been his 
life. Keep going regardless of what it was. If he

21:31.661 --> 21:35.545
hadn't learned it before the Marine Corps, he 
would have learned it in the Marine Corps. Now,

21:35.963 --> 21:49.757
I've heard a story that Dr. DeBakey came to you in 
the wee hours one morning and asked you to sign some

21:35.963 --> 21:49.757
kind of permission for him to use a special drug or a 
special technique. I don't know what I signed. One

21:51.338 --> 22:00.367
night I got a phone call that said

21:51.338 --> 22:00.367
that Dr. DeBakey feels like he should operate 
before morning. And they came up. We had all

22:02.289 --> 22:03.450
undressed. Roger was there. We went out in the 
hallway of the apartment. Roger Miller. He stayed

22:09.053 --> 22:10.616
with me all that time. Went out in the hallway in 
their night clothes because we had opened the two

22:11.117 --> 22:20.391
sofas in the room where the girls and I slept. And 
Roger had the bedroom. And so we just all went out

22:23.015 --> 22:26.901
there, and the doctor came up and explained to us. 
And he moved to Florida, that doctor. I shouldn't

22:30.588 --> 22:32.010
remember his name, too. I could remember all these 
names if I wasn't just yakking like this.

22:38.038 --> 22:39.781
Explained us what they were going to do. And Dr. 
DeBakey had gone home to take a nap. And then he

22:43.406 --> 22:44.868
operated. And of course, we sat up the rest of the 
night. And then when the phone go off, they had us

22:47.852 --> 22:50.856
come down to his office. And they told us that 
everything had been fine. And Dr. DeBakey, after a

22:55.162 --> 22:58.266
little while, said, I've got to get back to my 
patient.

23:01.385 --> 23:15.411
And see, they had been friends, though, from the 
time Jack was coordinating commissioner because

23:01.385 --> 23:15.411
he arranged for the medical school to have the same 
pay from the state with their increase that it cost

23:15.728 --> 23:25.442
the state to train a doctor. And that was part of 
Jack's coordinating program, so they had known.

23:28.886 --> 23:31.570
And Jaworski was involved in that scene, too. So 
these go back to 66, these friendships. And these

23:35.476 --> 23:37.939
were people you could respect. And so I could see 
why they liked Jack. And I think Jack was a

23:41.119 --> 23:43.402
respectable person. Certainly. And they were 
too. And I could see why you would

23:46.346 --> 23:52.655
associate yourself with those people. And they 
were both leaders in their field.

23:58.824 --> 24:08.297
When did Dr. Williams learn that the board had 
decided that they were not going to allow him to

23:58.824 --> 24:08.297
remain as president of the system and of the 
university that they were going to recreate the

24:08.648 --> 24:11.632
chancellor job. The morning that it happened? The 
morning of what happened? We're muting it all the

24:18.800 --> 24:20.122
time.

24:23.686 --> 24:28.132
That board meeting where they decided that, was 
that soon after? Mr. Wells had asked him to write

24:34.568 --> 24:35.649
about Jarvin. He said, I've had a lot of letters on 
him. And of course, Jack was pushing Calhoun,

24:38.993 --> 24:44.240
which I told him it wouldn't work. But he went to 
work that morning, and they told him. And Jack

24:49.406 --> 24:54.792
said, first thing he did, he went to the telephone 
and called me and told me to call the girls. He did

24:55.153 --> 24:58.177
not want them to hear it on the radio or read it in the 
paper. He left that group and called me. Then he

25:04.606 --> 25:07.410
went back and asked them, did they have anybody to 
run the meeting? And they said no, and he held the

25:09.332 --> 25:11.195
meeting for them. And then at the end of presiding 
over their meeting, after they'd just fired him

25:11.215 --> 25:22.250
when he got to work that day, he went back and got up 
and said, this is my final meeting. But he also told

25:22.570 --> 25:27.277
them, which Jarvis had to know, that Jarvis was not 
qualified. He said, why don't you give him

25:27.557 --> 25:31.322
something to do and let him get some experience? 
And, of course, Jarvis knew that because... I'm

25:36.568 --> 25:40.572
trying to think of this man that worked for Jack as 
his assistant, the board secretary. Oh, oh. Bob

25:43.455 --> 25:44.095
Cherry. Bob Cherry. You should be telling these 
stories. You know all right his name. When Jack

25:48.860 --> 25:54.566
went to College Station first time, Fort Albright 
told him to fire Bob Cherry. And Jack said, I

25:55.147 --> 25:59.211
couldn't come out here and start firing people. 
And... He learned and he realized later on that Bob

26:01.205 --> 26:05.849
was not loyal. Dr. Williams told me one day that the 
biggest mistake he made was not taking that advice

26:05.869 --> 26:14.377
when he first received it. He said he's 
ingratiating himself to the board now that I can't

26:14.417 --> 26:18.160
do it. Isn't that saying that he had to put up 
with... See, I think Jack was about the most loyal

26:19.361 --> 26:30.351
person to the university that anybody could be. 
and to his friends, and he had to tolerate Bob

26:31.293 --> 26:35.998
Cherry. Now, y'all moved over to the board house, 
the old Board of Regents house just north of

26:36.619 --> 26:47.070
Sabeasa, a few weeks? No, it was later than that. We 
stayed in Preston's house for quite a while until

26:48.532 --> 26:55.800
Jarvis said he needed to entertain. He needed it. 
And we were glad to... No, but we also knew now, when

26:59.440 --> 27:06.188
we were in the board house, I'm the person that, 
that was my decision. I told them get rid of the rats

27:07.610 --> 27:16.521
and the bugs, that I couldn't live with rats and 
bugs, which that was noted for, that I never lived

27:07.610 --> 27:16.521
with anything like that. But since I already knew, 
Phil Hoffman. That's the president of the

27:21.748 --> 27:24.451
University of Houston that we couldn't remember. 
See what I'm saying? Names come to you when you're

27:25.753 --> 27:28.536
not trying to think of their name. What did you 
furnish that board house with? Whose furniture

27:32.547 --> 27:34.771
was that? Mine. So, some that had, well, you took it 
out of storage, and some of it had been in storage,

27:35.051 --> 27:44.447
and others... Yeah, uh-huh. And how long were you 
all there before the house caught fire? Not very

27:49.930 --> 27:53.735
long, but I don't remember the details of it. Less 
than a year, I think. You know, it wasn't because it

27:55.838 --> 27:58.161
was... They had a little trouble in Houston 
getting rid of the man that they had felt that was

27:58.521 --> 28:10.057
not capable of doing what needed to be done, and he 
was adamant about not leaving. But they had to do it

28:10.898 --> 28:13.101
carefully. Describe the floor plan of the... that 
board house upstairs. How many bedrooms were

28:20.250 --> 28:22.152
there and so forth? Upstairs? I don't know. Oh, no, 
I'm sorry. Downstairs. Downstairs, yeah.

28:26.016 --> 28:27.578
Describe the downstairs area. What was it? How 
many rooms were there? There was an entrance hall

28:29.920 --> 28:39.030
with a, I guess you would say, a living room on one 
side and a dining area, something on the other

28:29.920 --> 28:39.030
side. I don't remember, and the bedrooms were...

28:45.280 --> 28:45.881
connected. I had my antique bed in one room and Jack 
was in the bed in the other room, the one closest to

28:45.941 --> 28:53.211
the outside wall. So were there two bedrooms, 
three bedrooms? Two downstairs and a big dining

28:56.936 --> 29:13.819
room and two, I guess you'd call it almost a double 
with the hall splitting the entrance area and two

28:56.936 --> 29:13.819
baths on the first floor and the kitchen. It was 
okay to live in. I was very careful about trying to

29:18.062 --> 29:23.347
get the blinds to where you couldn't see through 
them since we were living on the street. That was my

29:24.809 --> 29:28.512
only problem was living on the street, you know, 
where people could see in.

29:31.415 --> 29:39.582
We talked at lunch about the fire, but to be sure 
that we get it recorded, describe the night that

29:31.415 --> 29:39.582
the building caught fire. You were saying that... 
Well, I heard this pounding on the door. And I got up

29:44.107 --> 29:51.236
and went to the door, and one of the security 
officers from the campus had seen the fire coming

29:44.107 --> 29:51.236
out of the roof. And so he said, I was just ready to 
kick the door in. It took me a while to get up and put

29:55.362 --> 29:57.745
on a robe and go to the door. And then Jack got up and 
said, I'll move the cars. And he took his, I'm sure

30:03.813 --> 30:13.185
he took his medicine, but I know he took his account 
book out of the fireproof safe. And he left. And

30:15.868 --> 30:18.051
then I was left with this gentleman. And he wanted 
me to show him where to turn off the electricity.

30:21.536 --> 30:23.018
And I dropped my earring. And until I found my 
earring, I didn't budge. And don't you feel that

30:26.463 --> 30:29.648
way about something that you have? But I did pick up 
my clothes. And I took them out to the car and

30:32.132 --> 30:35.356
dressed in the car. And we watched the fire people 
come and go. And then we went to the motel. and

30:43.608 --> 30:49.536
checked in over there for the night, and a real 
sweet thing happened.

30:52.260 --> 31:09.765
We had twin beds, and Jack was in bed, and I was in 
one, and I got up and went around the other side of

30:52.260 --> 31:09.765
him, not between the beds, but the other side, got 
in bed beside me, and I put my arm around him, and he

30:52.260 --> 31:09.765
said, my heart didn't stop pounding until you put 
your arm around me. That's a special one. But you

31:13.291 --> 31:20.879
never forget that, that my putting my arm around 
him calmed him down that night because he could

31:13.291 --> 31:20.879
have died. And Jarvis and Bob Cherry were in a car 
together that night and drove up and saw us sitting

31:21.540 --> 31:30.409
in our car. And I don't remember what was said or if 
anything was said, but I think Jack just moved our

31:31.771 --> 31:38.438
car away from him. The fire started as far as you 
know about what time, 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning?

31:45.653 --> 31:46.214
I don't have any idea. What time did he kick the door 
in, do you know? No. It wouldn't have occurred to me

31:51.980 --> 31:58.028
to go see what time it was. You might go back and find 
from some record someplace else what time it was,

31:58.088 --> 32:05.016
but it wouldn't have occurred to me.
