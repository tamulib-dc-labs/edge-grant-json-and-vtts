WEBVTT

00:02.697 --> 00:14.753
As such, that consultant, that consultant better know a great deal about the ins and outs, the political sides of this.

00:15.414 --> 00:22.944
Because you just can't, you know, the state, keep in mind, and again, I haven't shared, we're a land-grant school.

00:23.385 --> 00:25.768
And if you look at the mandate of the land-grant school,

00:27.520 --> 00:40.365
I mean our job is to take the the the middle class and the lower middle class and even the lower class and ratchet these people up so any good Texan

00:40.868 --> 01:07.568
said if that's your mention take my kid see and so you've got that piece there and and you've still got you've still got over there uh those people my age and older those 70 and 80 years old who came here as uh with no shoes so to speak and an old dean potts or somebody you know should have kicked their butt out when he says son we're going to give you one more chance

01:08.071 --> 01:10.896
And they're peppered all around this state.

01:10.916 --> 01:26.725
And you have that, I don't want to say it's a reputation, you've got that mindset and you've got that tradition of taking that poor kid and making something out of him.

01:26.745 --> 01:29.370
Except our problem is you've got so damn many kids.

01:30.177 --> 01:44.476
And what we haven't done a good job of, I guess, as you look at the system, is trying to, you know, make the San Marcoses and make the Tarleton States and the other schools acceptable alternatives.

01:44.736 --> 01:46.499
Yesterday, he was in San Antonio.

01:47.200 --> 01:49.703
And this lady's just dying to get her daughter here.

01:49.723 --> 01:52.447
But her daughter has a 1390 SAT.

01:54.910 --> 01:58.615
You know, gotten the upper 700s off of her math.

01:59.422 --> 02:01.257
Well, she's not going to have a problem.

02:01.277 --> 02:04.099
She wants to get in the honors program, but she's just dying to get over here.

02:05.648 --> 02:13.396
How do you think the quality of the business program now truly compares with the national?

02:13.416 --> 02:15.037
Oh, I think we're up there.

02:15.057 --> 02:21.604
I think our quality of our undergraduate program is as good as... Where do you think we, in a ranking, we rank?

02:21.624 --> 02:27.510
Oh, we're probably, you know, I think we're probably easily... Our undergraduate program quality rise among the public schools.

02:27.570 --> 02:27.750
Yeah.

02:28.131 --> 02:29.252
Among the public schools.

02:29.312 --> 02:30.092
We're in the top 25.

02:30.273 --> 02:31.534
I really do.

02:31.594 --> 02:32.635
I really think we're...

02:32.615 --> 02:40.783
Our problem, and the others have the same problem, is that we give too many multiple choice exams because we've got too many kids.

02:40.803 --> 02:46.930
You know, I still try to give exams, multiple choice exams, when I got teaching two sections of 120.

02:46.970 --> 02:53.977
It's a lot of work on my part, but I just think I get a better feel of what those kids can do.

02:53.997 --> 03:01.204
Who are the people, the individuals who deserve the most credit for the quality of the program here?

03:02.551 --> 03:04.713
Well, it's... Now and or in the past.

03:05.274 --> 03:09.478
Well, if you look, you know, from... There's several audiences.

03:09.678 --> 03:15.003
Let's look among the... If we're trying to get the best faculty, it begins with faculty.

03:15.424 --> 03:28.216
Oh, no, I'm talking about who deserves in the past, who has earned the... Who deserves to pat on the back either historically or currently for... Taking his hand?

03:28.296 --> 03:28.997
Yeah.

03:29.635 --> 03:30.999
Oh, I would think Benton.

03:31.660 --> 03:35.029
Benton, I think, you know, started with Muse.

03:35.811 --> 03:38.719
Muse, Mobley, and Benton have taken us there.

03:39.401 --> 03:41.687
Hellrigo's done one heck of a job.

03:41.819 --> 03:52.472
Who are the faculty members in the college who deserve the biggest pats on the back now and or in the past?

03:52.492 --> 03:59.321
Well, I can only speak from, well, I can only speak, but again, you know, I think Lynn Berry, and I've mentioned his name.

03:59.862 --> 04:03.947
Pete Rose and Don Frazier have always done a great job for us here.

04:05.189 --> 04:09.514
And accounting, I don't,

04:10.203 --> 04:22.906
I don't know who does that, but Jim Benjamin does a very good job politically of keeping A&M in front of the Arthur Andersons and the consulting firms.

04:23.207 --> 04:27.895
We have this PPA program and we have kids knocking themselves out.

04:27.936 --> 04:31.502
That's a five-year program where they come out with a master's in accounting and they have their

04:31.482 --> 04:33.606
ready to sit for the CPA.

04:34.047 --> 04:36.552
A lot of kids going into that program.

04:36.893 --> 04:40.039
Who have been your closest friends, buddies, colleagues?

04:40.820 --> 04:41.782
On the academic side?

04:42.965 --> 04:52.343
Probably two or three that over the years would be Dan Robertson and

04:53.386 --> 04:57.435
Paul Bush and Dan probably are the closest.

04:58.818 --> 05:06.214
Over the years, of course, it was with Bill Pryde, but basically those two.

05:06.498 --> 05:16.972
Where at noon or during the work day, at noon or coffee time, where would you and a group go to talk about something important or something you just wanted to share?

05:17.012 --> 05:17.814
We just come in here.

05:18.034 --> 05:19.816
You know, we aren't that collegial.

05:20.257 --> 05:22.420
You know, there's groups that go for coffee.

05:22.780 --> 05:24.983
We don't buddy around that much.

05:25.003 --> 05:29.389
I see, I maybe go out and eat with Dan and Robertson.

05:29.670 --> 05:30.431
Where do you eat for lunch?

05:31.212 --> 05:31.532
At home.

05:31.953 --> 05:32.734
Go home for lunch.

05:32.914 --> 05:35.678
Because Patty and I can talk about the day.

05:35.793 --> 05:38.898
And if I have other things to do, I'll bring my lunch.

05:39.338 --> 05:41.141
You know, eat in there with the secretaries.

05:41.802 --> 05:43.845
And I enjoy eating with the secretaries, you know.

05:44.727 --> 05:52.298
Share with this machine two or three anecdotes that are unique to your experience and or Texas A&M.

05:53.600 --> 05:59.028
Well, I think one of them that I've shared with you that I just love was when I was teaching a class.

06:00.711 --> 06:02.914
I'm talking about student anecdotes.

06:04.868 --> 06:22.769
And I was saying, you know, the first stage of this hierarchy of economic cooperation is just when two countries try to equally improve themselves by cooperating on some economic stuff.

06:22.789 --> 06:24.911
For example, the St.

06:24.931 --> 06:31.238
Lawrence Wheelay, the Seaway, was a cooperation between Canada and the United States.

06:31.299 --> 06:33.441
A lot of dollars spent on both sides.

06:33.893 --> 07:01.420
and uh a uh over in the alps there was uh the uh cooperation uh between the italians and the switz swiss to build this 17-mile tunnel that connected italy with switzerland so i asked on an exam about the hierarchy of economic development gives an example so this one student wrote

07:01.957 --> 07:11.730
said well one student is at the very bottom where two countries just cooperate for example uh italy and sweden

07:12.706 --> 07:16.573
cooperated to build this seventeen-mile tunnel across the Appalachians.

07:19.859 --> 07:24.928
And I just let out a big roar about that.

07:25.790 --> 07:28.194
Any others?

07:28.815 --> 07:32.402
Well, years ago, this is kind of off color, but I remember

07:33.057 --> 07:37.225
doing something and telling these guys, come on, guys, get with it.

07:37.305 --> 07:38.868
You need to put more time and study.

07:38.888 --> 07:41.533
And these were back in the Corps days.

07:42.776 --> 07:44.599
He said, Dr. Gillespie, we've got the gas.

07:45.541 --> 07:46.463
Well, what's the gas?

07:46.523 --> 07:47.705
You don't know what the gas is?

07:48.487 --> 07:49.128
No.

07:49.148 --> 07:49.729
Well, what's the gas?

07:49.769 --> 07:51.252
You just don't give a shot.

07:53.695 --> 08:02.627
You know, and by changing the subject, you know, there are times that you're really proud of things.

08:02.667 --> 08:06.953
I've shared a few of them, but already I've shared some things I'm proud of.

08:07.013 --> 08:11.940
But another one was the Centennial Committee that you chaired.

08:12.427 --> 08:33.439
I thought, and I'm always just proud as punch to see Rodney Hill's stuff up there, for $25,000 we got five panels, solid walnut, and I think that's what it was, $25,000, and we got a rendition at two-thirds size, and then all the politics that went on about

08:33.419 --> 08:51.900
changing some department or some college didn't get as much space as the other and what Rodney had to go through and perhaps you had to to to mediate all this but that panel is a work of art masterpiece and I felt really proud to be on that committee.

08:51.880 --> 08:53.502
Yeah, I've got another panel.

08:53.642 --> 08:57.668
Well, it's growing also in its luster and its fame.

08:58.008 --> 09:00.311
Oh, yeah, it's patina.

09:00.752 --> 09:02.073
Yeah, fame is right.

09:02.133 --> 09:10.625
And that was a great assignment that John Pearson and I really, really liked that one.

09:11.426 --> 09:19.356
As you think back, were there any key decisions in the department or college that you now realize those were pivotal?

09:21.226 --> 09:23.628
when you all decided to do this instead of that?

09:24.509 --> 09:26.070
No, uh-uh.

09:26.090 --> 09:28.852
No big change that I was—got involved in.

09:28.892 --> 09:33.937
Well, yeah, you do a—you do a five-year—when Muse came in, we're going to do a five-year plan.

09:34.217 --> 09:40.362
Okay, and that was— That's probably—that made us really—and we would review that semi-annually.

09:41.603 --> 09:43.265
So he kept you focused.

09:43.925 --> 09:44.846
It just wasn't paper.

09:45.487 --> 09:46.107
Tell me about it.

09:46.247 --> 09:46.808
Where are we going?

09:46.848 --> 09:47.788
What should we change?

09:48.229 --> 09:49.550
Why can't we do what we're doing?

09:50.611 --> 09:50.811
Yeah.

09:51.196 --> 09:57.622
All right, let me then, if we're going to need to worry about time, two more questions, then we'll quit.

09:59.204 --> 10:11.756
If you had a million dollars that someone gave you and you could pass it on to Texas A&M, but you decide what use would be made of that gift, what would you want it used?

10:11.777 --> 10:12.737
You know, I've thought about that.

10:13.558 --> 10:20.325
I think everybody thought that because, you know, they think sometimes you might have some money.

10:21.773 --> 10:25.456
I'm not sure that I would give it to students, you know, the scholarship.

10:25.476 --> 10:26.597
That's the easiest place to go.

10:26.657 --> 10:27.478
You can decide.

10:27.498 --> 10:28.559
No, but you'd struggle with that.

10:28.679 --> 10:29.540
You would struggle with that.

10:30.921 --> 10:32.102
It would be programmatic.

10:33.984 --> 10:51.679
I've even thought of just giving unrestricted funds to the department head of marketing and say, there's a million bucks, put in foundation, it'll scrape off $50,000 a year, hard cash.

10:53.397 --> 11:17.987
you just report to the dean how you use it uh for the for the good of the department for the good of the department the other place that i would probably give it is for the fellows program our cba fellows program undergraduates it's underfunded and uh it's probably underfunded by that much fifty thousand dollar a million dollar endowment fifty thousand dollars a year

11:18.625 --> 11:42.070
so that they could truly do the things they need to do to give those kids enough experience and enough experiences as juniors and seniors of what it's going to be like to manage a complex organization.

11:42.931 --> 11:46.675
I mean we take 50 kids a year

11:47.363 --> 11:48.589
and that's probably a little bit.

11:49.573 --> 11:54.576
I think we'd probably be better off if we took 25, but we got so many good kids, it's hard to do.

11:55.199 --> 11:56.445
Take 50 kids a year,

11:56.780 --> 12:01.566
And so 100 are in the pot all the time and really work.

12:01.586 --> 12:08.415
We work very, very hard to try to get the leadership potential that those people have in them.

12:09.116 --> 12:18.148
They're high achievers, hard workers, and they know there's payoff for them if they can excel in this program.

12:18.609 --> 12:20.051
I'd give that money there.

12:20.772 --> 12:21.092
All right.

12:21.112 --> 12:25.538
So the last question is, what feelings do you have for Texas A&M today?

12:25.518 --> 12:48.943
Oh you know uh every time every every muster is a tearjerker for me uh every uh when I go over to Rudder Tire and sit down and and and see those films out at the Alpout Center I mean those are those are tough I I've I've been known and I faculty know that I've sat with

12:49.480 --> 13:17.344
prospective faculty up there at the faculty uh uh club and at lunch and we have to go off to the side and they'll ask me and i start talking about a m and i get tears i i choke i literally choke i you know i have to can't just because i think there's uh so much to offer to the state of texas and to for our kids and you know that we have here in texas and what we what they can take away uh

13:18.016 --> 13:23.361
As much as this is a land-grant school, I do wish we were more selective.

13:23.681 --> 13:33.570
I do wish we would, rather than certify, because we got a lot of kids in here who just want to be certified, and this is what disappoints me.

13:34.391 --> 13:42.638
I can go into class today, and I can tell you probably within three class periods who wants to be certified and who wants to work.

13:43.639 --> 13:46.622
And I wish I could say, okay, you guys that want to be certified,

13:47.210 --> 13:48.471
Here's the only thing you have to do.

13:48.652 --> 13:49.973
All you gotta do is pass the exams.

13:50.414 --> 13:53.697
Don't even have to come in class, just pass the exams.

13:54.558 --> 14:04.569
Don't have to participate in this, don't have to do all this other stuff that we, and I press them pretty hard, and you're gonna get a D. Now get out.

14:06.191 --> 14:10.616
Because they really don't, they detract from the quality of the class.

14:11.197 --> 14:16.963
We have a lot of kids that want to succeed, and we have a lot of kids that just want to be certified, don't want to be educated.

14:19.053 --> 14:21.538
They're here for the ring because the ring's going to give them the job.

14:23.783 --> 14:32.983
Not very many, but enough that it's a disappointment.

14:33.284 --> 14:34.366
But I love this school.

14:35.128 --> 14:36.150
Let's quit with that line.
