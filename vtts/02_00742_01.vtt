00:01.972 --> 00:18.392
First, Mr. Hill, tell us something about your 
early life, including the names of your parents,

00:01.972 --> 00:18.392
the dates and places of their birth and death, 
where they were born, where you were born, I mean,

00:01.972 --> 00:18.392
and the date of your birth, and the schools you 
attended before you came to Texas A&M. Well, my

00:19.373 --> 00:29.025
father's name was Fielding Hill, and my mother's 
name was Minta, M-I-N-T-A.

00:30.389 --> 00:38.079
Both of my parents died in Dallas in the Terrell, 
T-E-R-R-I-L-L, nursing home. My father was 88

00:40.002 --> 00:46.791
years, 12 months, and nine days. I mean, nine 
months and 12 days. And my mother was 93 years and

00:50.977 --> 00:54.101
one week.

00:57.305 --> 00:58.827
Why not tell him where you were born? And I was born 
at... at Wills Point, Texas, which is 50 miles.

01:03.903 --> 01:07.929
Well, it's known as Wills Point. Do you remember 
where your parents were born? Yes, my mother was

01:11.234 --> 01:14.059
born in Mississippi. My

01:14.119 --> 01:21.371
father was born where? Oh, no. Where was he born? 
Oh, baby.

01:31.460 --> 01:32.443
What are you telling them? I don't remember. I'm 
sure my father was born in I

01:34.068 --> 01:43.857
think Alabama. Alabama. And I know my mother was 
born in Mississippi. Did you go to school in Wills

01:47.390 --> 01:50.734
Point? Yes, I finished high school in Wills Point. 
You went as many grades as they had there. Yes, 12.

01:55.560 --> 01:57.062
12 grades. In 1917, about the first of June, of 
course, and then that fall I went to A&M. What type

02:04.772 --> 02:06.795
of business was your father in? We farmed about 400 
acres with hired labor, which was rather unusual

02:07.095 --> 02:14.865
at that time. and then he was in the cotton seed and 
grain business. Planting seed, he, we, well

02:19.152 --> 02:39.064
that's what I spent my time as a young boy from the 
time I was eight years old on taking care of the farm

02:19.152 --> 02:39.064
with like cotton choppers and the pickers and I 
never could pick cotton but I could haul the cotton

02:39.584 --> 02:41.968
to the gin and the way and things like that. But I 
just, I just, my hands, I could get it in my hand, but

02:42.088 --> 02:47.276
I couldn't get it in my sack. And so he said, son, you 
just don't know how to pick cotton. You don't have

02:49.859 --> 02:51.562
to pick cotton. But you were kind of a supervisor. 
Right. I was a supervisor. And he, uh, we, it became

02:55.949 --> 03:02.959
necessary later on that we, you know, the, so many, 
uh, of states wouldn't let our cottonseed come in

03:04.964 --> 03:17.082
like Arkansas wouldn't let them come in on account 
of the

03:04.964 --> 03:17.082
bow weevil. So we made a drum type machine where the 
cottonseed went in and spilled over and went

03:17.203 --> 03:29.642
through a heat process of certain degrees. And it 
was state approved and also approved by the other

03:29.662 --> 03:33.908
states like We couldn't go into Oklahoma, we 
couldn't go into Louisiana, and we couldn't go

03:34.445 --> 03:39.671
into Arkansas. But Arkansas was our main source. 
That's where we sold most of the cotton seed. And

03:47.981 --> 03:54.049
like we'd give $60 a ton for the seed, then we'd 
treat them and sack them. And they were selected,

03:54.690 --> 03:56.772
of course. And while this process was going on, all 
the little seed would drop out. It would just save

04:01.278 --> 04:02.359
them. what you call culling it, culling it and 
heeding it and killing the wheels. So you bought

04:10.181 --> 04:12.545
the seed then from the farmer. Your father bought 
the seed. Yes, we kept our own seed. We raised quite

04:15.910 --> 04:16.991
a few. But then we would sell to a farmer, and then we 
would buy from him that fall. Buy the seed back. So

04:23.662 --> 04:24.804
you kept the same variety. Right. Rowden was it. 
R-O-W-D-E-N was the name of the seed. You mixed

04:28.950 --> 04:30.152
varieties in. No, it was just the mebane and half 
and half and rowding were the three signs. And the

04:38.579 --> 04:43.527
mebane and the other one were short staple. The 
rowding was a long staple cotton. They got up to

04:46.511 --> 04:53.181
$0.04 to $0.05 premium on the long staple. Most of 
the other was 15, 16, which we'd get out here, and we

04:53.442 --> 05:00.392
would go one and an eighth and stuff like that with 
the rowding. And so then you would process the seed

05:01.503 --> 05:07.191
and sell it wherever there was a market for it. Yes. 
My father would leave, and he'd probably get come

05:07.591 --> 05:10.855
back. He'd be gone a week and come back with orders 
for maybe six or seven core load, which a core load

05:10.895 --> 05:21.309
is considered 1,000 bushels or 1,050 bushels. And 
then you also, did you raise grain on your farm too?

05:26.716 --> 05:27.097
Oh, yes. What kind of grain? Wheat. Wheat. Yes. 
Wheat and oats. And just oats to feed our stock,

05:31.135 --> 05:38.883
that was a prominent feed. Okay, what factors 
influenced you to choose Texas A&M? Well, of

05:45.149 --> 05:51.775
course, I had an older brother, Perch Hill, you 
know, and the other one, the three of the boys. In

05:51.815 --> 05:55.279
fact, the four of them, four boys, all went to A&M. 
So you were influenced by your older brother.

05:57.401 --> 05:59.623
Yeah, and another thing that influenced me was 
Leon Gilmore, which was later my brother-in-law,

05:59.958 --> 06:07.807
was a center on the 1917 team. You know, 270 points 
to opponents, nothing. And of course, I had room

06:11.411 --> 06:14.255
with him. And Jack Finney, another boy from Willis 
Point who became a architect and taught at A&M for

06:14.395 --> 06:24.987
quite some years. They were the men, too, that I 
wanted to be with. OK. What procedures did you go

06:30.063 --> 06:32.648
through to enter school? Did you have to send your 
grades in advance, or did you just carry your

06:33.650 --> 06:37.638
transcript or record? No, we sent them in advance. 
And did you get a letter then from the school saying

06:40.323 --> 06:44.130
you were accepted? Well, I really don't know that 
or whether Leon, my brother-in-law, handled it or

06:53.755 --> 07:01.484
I know what we did, we'd take money, a check with us, 
to pay our tuition as we entered. So you paid the

07:02.525 --> 07:04.667
tuition for what, one semester? No, no, no. The 
whole year? The whole year. And what was your first

07:07.971 --> 07:11.716
reaction? Of course, having had a brother there, 
you were somewhat familiar to the school. Well, it

07:16.121 --> 07:17.642
was rather unusual. We got in there in the morning 
about, oh, 2.30. And at that time, we were assigned

07:23.843 --> 07:36.125
to Miller, down the basement, right on the side 
next to where the old dining hall used to be. I don't

07:36.205 --> 07:38.689
think it's there now, is it? Well, Sbisa. Yeah, 
Sbisa's still there. I don't believe that is one,

07:43.250 --> 07:45.693
no, that's ten. Anyhow. At the end of Military 
Walk? Yeah. Yeah, that's Spesa. Yeah. Because the

07:49.898 --> 07:58.127
old mess hall burned in 13, I believe, and Spesa was 
constructed the following year, so. Well, we were

07:58.147 --> 08:11.282
right near it, and to go in a strange place like that 
with no lights and sleep on just a mattress with no

07:58.147 --> 08:11.282
pillow, It's not a very comfortable start, I'll 
say that. No, I wouldn't think so. You say you were

08:16.591 --> 08:20.256
saying, was there somebody there to meet the train 
and tell you where to go then? Well, see, I was with

08:21.018 --> 08:22.480
Leon. That was his sophomore year. Okay, he was a 
sophomore. And Jack and I were freshmen. So he kind

08:29.351 --> 08:31.394
of took you in hand. He took me in hand in Dallas and 
all, everything. We had to go to Dallas and wait on

08:35.341 --> 08:37.945
the train. We went shopping, bought shoes, and 
went, bought supplies that we'd need. Then did you

08:44.680 --> 08:47.845
register to the day after you got there then? I 
really don't know whether it'd be the next day or, I

08:48.886 --> 08:52.733
would think the next day. Sometime fairly soon 
anyway. I think the next day. Did you have any

08:55.437 --> 08:59.143
choice about military company to which you were 
assigned? Oh, no. You were assigned. Which one did

09:01.346 --> 09:03.049
you enter? Company H, and I had a, Coxy Evans was our 
captain from Fort Worth, which one of the, he was

09:06.241 --> 09:13.174
killed in the service. Well, I think one of the 
finest men I ever knew in my life. He was a leader and

09:15.559 --> 09:18.084
a fine man. Where was Company H housed then? In 
Millner. So you spent the first night in Millner.

09:24.517 --> 09:28.441
Did you stay in the basement after you were 
registered, or did you have a room elsewhere? No,

09:28.542 --> 09:29.042
no. I think we got that same room. See, since my 
brother-in-law had been there a year, he knew the

09:32.966 --> 09:41.696
ropes, and I think he'd had the room the year 
before. And then you roomed with him even though he

09:43.918 --> 09:46.201
was a sophomore. Right. Yeah, you could room with 
seniors or anyone at two. that if he wanted for a

09:50.723 --> 09:53.608
roommate, you could arrange it. I see. Were you 
sort of his man then? Did you do some chores for him

09:57.034 --> 09:59.458
from time to time? No, he was pretty busy with his 
studies and football and everything, and I didn't

09:59.498 --> 10:07.772
see too much of him except at night. But on Saturday 
night, the hazing was real bad at A&M at that time.

10:13.782 --> 10:16.326
In fact, it was a little bit too bad. Here it is, E.B. 
Your mother was burned in Alabama but was reared on

10:18.499 --> 10:24.626
a plantation in northern Mississippi. Melna 
Rutledge came to Texas with her family in 1883.

10:33.097 --> 10:35.279
Did you stay in Milner all four years? No, I didn't 
finish. You didn't finish? No. I left the next

10:39.184 --> 10:42.328
October. I was there the first year and then 
left... See, my brother died. You were there for

10:48.418 --> 10:49.421
17, 18. Yeah, yes. And then went back. And then my 
father, we were quarantined. And my father wired

10:57.185 --> 11:00.555
me, come home immediately. And we had all had the 
flu. In fact, for three weeks, seven boys a day died

11:03.785 --> 11:09.536
in A&M. And I was in Leggett at that time in an inner 
court there, you know, the courtyard. There's

11:14.927 --> 11:23.303
three freshmen right across from me and all died 
and never had one dose of medicine or a doctor ever

11:14.927 --> 11:23.303
saw them. And I had to lie there on my bed. I couldn't 
get out. And I had to lie and listen to those boys

11:26.199 --> 11:30.447
scream and died right there. So the second year you 
went back, and that's when you had the flu epidemic

11:31.228 --> 11:36.017
in the 1819s. Right. That's during the war. That's 
when everybody was in the SATC. Yes. But see, I was

11:41.067 --> 11:42.390
young enough. I didn't have to join. You didn't 
join the SATC. No, no. You went to regular classes

11:46.435 --> 11:48.678
in the second year? Yeah, but I took the military 
training and everything. In fact, I didn't have to

11:53.224 --> 11:59.051
do anything that I didn't want to do in the 
military. Your daddy was born in Texas. I knew he

12:01.835 --> 12:02.496
was. This is that right up on there, 60th.

12:09.225 --> 12:10.927
I thought he was a native Texan. Yeah, I'm sorry. He 
was in... Panola County, that's down out of

12:15.258 --> 12:24.330
Carthage, between Carthage and the Shreveport 
line. And they owned all that property down there,

12:25.191 --> 12:28.115
and he didn't want it. He sold it, and that's where 
all the gas wells, oh, they're the... But he did

12:33.962 --> 12:34.783
good. He made us a good living. This, talking about 
history, that is real interesting. That tells

12:40.391 --> 12:44.316
about the marriage of his mother and father. This 
was a... 60th wedding anniversary party we had for

12:46.358 --> 12:52.028
them years ago. They were too ill to have their 
party at the 50th. We had to wait until we were

12:55.634 --> 12:59.501
married 60 to have them. Let me ask you, you left the 
school then in October of 18. Yes. Did you ever

13:08.797 --> 13:10.119
return then? No. No. Okay. What had you planned as 
your major? What had you planned to study when you

13:16.036 --> 13:18.959
came to A&M? Oh, I wanted to be a veterinary 
surgeon. And since you...

13:23.523 --> 13:31.951
Did you ultimately become a veterinary surgeon 
then? Only in practice. I was in the contractor

13:34.274 --> 13:36.436
business. I owned 60 head of mules. Mm-hmm. OK, 
skipping back, you mentioned when you arrived

13:41.152 --> 13:50.234
there, you were first assigned to Milner. And then 
the second year, the part that you were there, you

13:50.896 --> 13:54.064
stayed in Leggett for a while. The second year. The 
second year, you were in Leggett for a couple

13:55.467 --> 13:57.633
months. Right, in a room with a boat. a boy by the 
name of Malcolm Broadfoot from Longview, Texas.

14:04.336 --> 14:08.400
And he mixed all the syrups for Casey at the Y. And 
when this flu epidemic came on, he had a key so he

14:09.321 --> 14:17.047
could make, he became ill first. So he gave me the 
key and I'd go get him grapes and milk, oh, malted

14:17.067 --> 14:26.075
milks. That's what we lived on for two weeks. And 
then he was sick about a week, and I took care of him.

14:32.416 --> 14:34.638
Then I became sick, and he took care of me. And 
that's the only way we survived. So you could,

14:36.099 --> 14:39.462
while one of you was sick, the other was well. 
Right. At least well enough to take care of the

14:40.123 --> 14:41.784
other. Right. And then you went, your father 
called you home because of a sickness in the

14:42.645 --> 14:48.069
family. Yes, yes. How would you describe the life 
in the dormitory as you remember it? Well, my life

14:54.835 --> 14:58.358
was, I only had one occasion. that I felt I was 
mistreated. There was a

15:02.579 --> 15:21.102
Mexican from Laredo that, you know, when they walk 
in the mess hall, you all stand up until everyone's

15:02.579 --> 15:21.102
in, and they be seated. And I had a terrific 
headache. And I was leaning over my chair like

15:23.285 --> 15:27.130
this, you know, and he came up with his knee. And he 
hit and kicked me with his knee much, much too hard.

15:30.993 --> 15:31.614
And he hurt me. And my brother-in-law saw it. And he 
beat the stepping out of him. That's the only time

15:36.962 --> 15:38.645
when I was mistreated. Now, one time on Saturday 
night, I hadn't been there over, say, a couple of

15:38.665 --> 15:45.996
three weeks. But I had some friends that told me on 
Saturday night, stick tight. Just don't get out

15:51.986 --> 15:53.588
and run around. You'll get in trouble. They got me 
in one of the downstairs in the area, five of them,

15:56.860 --> 16:11.334
and they had those Sam Brown belts, and they made me 
stand on the table and hold my ankles, and they

15:56.860 --> 16:11.334
marched around me, and they hit me much too hard. 
But if you turn loose your ankles, they start over.

16:16.699 --> 16:25.568
So the second round, there was a window open over 
there, and I hit that window, and they never did get

16:16.699 --> 16:25.568
me again because on Saturday night, Trim Rigney, 
was in 104, the fourth floor up there. I mean, 401.

16:30.177 --> 16:32.420
I'm sorry, I said it backwards. And Saturday 
night, the minute it got dark, I was up there

16:32.440 --> 16:40.392
shining his boots, and they never touched me. He 
took me back to my room and closed that door, and

16:40.672 --> 16:46.240
they never got me again. So that was a regular 
Saturday night occurrence and you shined this

16:47.587 --> 16:52.332
other man's boots. Yeah, and another thing that I 
didn't approve of at all, those inner courts, they

16:52.492 --> 17:17.458
would take toilet paper and wet it, especially a 
half a roll, and then they'd stand in this window up

16:52.492 --> 17:17.458
there and somebody going by down like on the second 
floor or the first floor, they'd hit them in the

16:52.492 --> 17:17.458
side of the head with that wet toilet paper and it 
hurt some boys real bad. But overall, it was only

17:19.750 --> 17:33.518
your friends that hazed you, unless you'd get in 
one of those sessions like I was telling you about,

17:19.750 --> 17:33.518
and they had quite a few of those. But anyone would 
be stupid to get in them. You don't want to be that

17:36.023 --> 17:39.089
stupid. Get with one of your buddies. So the man 
whose boots you shined, Trig? Trim Rigney. Trim

17:48.122 --> 17:48.962
Rigney. From Leonard, Texas, and he played 
shortstop for the Detroit Tigers. Was he a senior

17:53.927 --> 17:54.888
then? He was a senior then, yes. And he was a, oh, he 
was a colonel, lieutenant colonel, very

17:56.730 --> 18:05.558
high-ranking officer.

18:09.081 --> 18:12.825
So it was to the freshman's advantage then to have 
a, An upperclassman. If you don't have one, you're

18:14.113 --> 18:18.679
in trouble.

18:20.461 --> 18:22.023
How was the food like in the mess hall? Or what was it 
like, I should say? It was real good. Very good.

18:27.630 --> 18:28.131
Plentiful. And like there would be an

18:29.072 --> 18:40.226
upperclassman, probably a captain or something 
at the end of the table. Then there'd be There's

18:42.404 --> 18:46.302
14 people at the table. And this one had, the little 
fish was They had these two inside. There was an

18:52.166 --> 18:59.056
upperclassman at the end, an upperclassman at 
this corner, and probably an upperclassman here.

18:59.337 --> 19:01.761
But the poor little old fish, here they were down in 
the middle. And what's left, that's what they got.

19:03.904 --> 19:10.674
But if you have a table with a good bunch of people, 
or you could wait and get seconds. But in the

19:11.015 --> 19:14.100
morning, we'd have hotcakes. And of course, 
they'd get the first ones, which would be A little

19:18.213 --> 19:24.078
better, and then eggs, and they fed us good, ample. 
You wouldn't complain about the food.

19:28.422 --> 19:39.572
Other than the,

19:28.422 --> 19:39.572
if you can call it a privilege of hazing the 
freshmen, did the upperclassmen have additional

19:28.422 --> 19:39.572
privileges? Did they have more freedom to move 
about than the fish did? Oh, yeah, pretty much.

19:46.458 --> 19:47.899
What sorts of things could they do? Well, the 
freshmen, they couldn't go many places, you know

19:48.520 --> 19:54.688
what I mean? They were restricted from, well, like 
the Y. The Y would be full of upper freshmen. There

20:03.280 --> 20:04.742
wouldn't be any room for the fish. And all the pool 
tables would be busy with upperclassmen. The fish

20:10.770 --> 20:12.672
wouldn't have a chance to play. In other words, if 
you could get you an upperclassman, a friend, to

20:13.428 --> 20:21.137
get you in with them and let you play, fine. 
Otherwise, you don't play. I imagine there were

20:22.819 --> 20:27.124
not a whole lot of pool tables for a whole bunch of 
boys. No, there wasn't. They were down in the

20:28.325 --> 20:29.807
basement. Why? But we got along real good. There's 
plenty to do. What type of things did you do for

20:35.053 --> 20:38.738
recreation and entertainment? Well, we talked 
mostly, and... I had quite a few friends from out of

20:42.841 --> 20:54.098
the country, one especially from Lima, Peru. And 
he was a very unusual boy. And then I had a boy that

20:57.283 --> 21:04.794
his roommate was a boy by the name of Clegg from San 
Angelo. And I spent some time with them. In fact, we

21:08.300 --> 21:11.785
went to Lima, Peru. This boy's father was a civil 
engineer, and he borrowed all the money from the

21:11.866 --> 21:22.557
United States in 1913 to build the railroads in 
Peru. And when we got to Peru, the first thing I did,

21:23.799 --> 21:38.014
I went to the hotel and I got the assistant manager 
and told him that I would, if possible, I would like

21:23.799 --> 21:38.014
to contact this friend. And he went to quite some a 
bit of trouble and found out, yes, he is a civil

21:42.258 --> 21:49.955
engineer and worked for a railroad and lives in 
Lima. And we can contact him. And the next morning

21:53.021 --> 21:56.689
he came to me and said, I contacted him. Two months 
ago, he died with a heart attack. So this was

21:59.936 --> 22:02.719
sometime after you had known him as a student. This 
was two or three years ago. Two or three years ago.

22:04.822 --> 22:06.964
And this was, I'm talking about 1917, 18. Were 
there a goodly number of Latin American students

22:08.266 --> 22:13.331
on campus? Many, many. From all the countries. In 
other words, the first time I ever saw soccer, they

22:16.114 --> 22:23.402
played, that's what they played, played soccer 
all the time. Quiet athletes, good ones. Did they

22:26.690 --> 22:30.655
just kind of have a pickup game of soccer, or did 
they have an organized? No, no, no, no, no, just out

22:30.976 --> 22:43.271
on a football field or a drill field, and they'd 
just say like 15 or 20 of them, 25 would get

22:30.976 --> 22:43.271
together, and they'd have a deal. It was not an 
intramural type? No, no, no, no, there wasn't

22:45.653 --> 22:48.597
enough of them for that, what I mean is. But you did 
have a lot of other intramural activities, I take

22:49.370 --> 22:52.095
it. Oh, yes. Did you participate in any? Yes. I 
played on the fish football team, and I weighed

22:54.860 --> 23:05.118
about 150 pounds, and I played the end. The big old 
boy weighed about 210, came around, and hit that

23:09.991 --> 23:13.274
knee, and I didn't play anymore. I was too little. 
Even then, you were too little. Too small. Today,

23:18.680 --> 23:26.288
if you're 150, they don't even think about

23:18.680 --> 23:26.288
you. Do you remember any of the other things? Did 
you ever have any movies on campus? I don't

23:31.434 --> 23:32.615
remember. I don't think so.

23:37.868 --> 23:39.310
We were busy. They kept us busy. See, in 1917, we had 
extended drill. We drilled. You'd get up at 6

23:49.400 --> 24:00.672
o'clock and go to Reveille, and you'd go to 
breakfast, and then you'd go to studies, and then

23:49.400 --> 24:00.672
when you're not in classes, you're out on that 
drill field. When you go into extended drill, uh

24:04.058 --> 24:23.603
drill but uh about how much of the time how much per 
day or per week would you say you drilled well we we

24:04.058 --> 24:23.603
had two hours every afternoon regular and then we 
had they called other times and back in 1918 while

24:04.058 --> 24:23.603
there was much worse but standing at attention 
there with all the The boys were sick and

24:24.916 --> 24:29.201
everything, and they'd fall out just like flies. 
Well, the man behind them was always supposed to

24:29.242 --> 24:32.866
take care of the man. And then they had extra men 
behind, you know, like a squadron, to take care of a

24:32.906 --> 24:41.858
man in the rear ranks that fell out. And out in that 
hot sun and everything, they fell out. I mean,

24:45.102 --> 24:46.924
plenty of them. This would be if you were lining up 
to march to meals or something? Yeah, to march to

24:51.298 --> 24:53.440
meals and to drill. And during drill, you had a lot 
of people. You know, and you had to parade, you

24:55.522 --> 25:00.047
know, the inspection, you know. And like the first 
company to go there, they might stand 20 minutes

25:00.968 --> 25:07.755
before they're inspected. And standing out there 
in the hot sun, you know, in the afternoon is pretty

25:08.396 --> 25:13.321
rough, especially when you have the flu. You had a 
daily inspection of the? Well, I wouldn't say

25:15.676 --> 25:28.774
daily, but quite often, you know, because it, and 
the bad thing about then, your best buddies, they

25:15.676 --> 25:28.774
were leaving every day, you know, going into 
service. In fact, it got down to where there was

25:28.794 --> 25:34.742
very few seniors on the, just very few. Now, did 
some of them leave during the year of 1718, or was it

25:35.843 --> 25:41.751
mostly the 1819 when the students were leaving? 
Most of them, no, some of them left in 17, 18, but

25:43.181 --> 25:57.123
most of them, of course, early, well, they didn't 
come back to school in 18, and a lot of them left in

25:43.181 --> 25:57.123
18.

26:00.007 --> 26:03.272
So you had virtually a senior-less school there 
for a while. Right, in 18.

26:09.381 --> 26:11.164
Did you have any favorite instructors During the 
time that you were there. I had one of the nicest

26:13.536 --> 26:21.404
men, and he's an English teacher, and he was 
crippled. One leg was, I'd say, an inch and a half

26:21.564 --> 26:26.389
shorter than the other. His name was Biddle, and I 
think he helped me more. He was like a father to me.

26:32.696 --> 26:38.282
When I had a problem, I'd go to him, and he always 
listened and was real sweet to me. Any other ones

26:39.967 --> 26:42.249
that you were particularly fond of? Yes, because I 
can't call too many names. But we had retired army

26:45.652 --> 26:55.962
officers, you know, as

26:45.652 --> 26:55.962
watchmen, you know. And we had to walk a post, you 
know, with a gun and everything. And they assigned

26:59.946 --> 27:05.011
you your position, you know, and took care of it and 
everything. But what did we call them? I'm trying

27:08.174 --> 27:09.315
to think. But anyhow, they had retired, like, 
colonels and... These were people who worked out

27:16.581 --> 27:18.944
of the commandant's office? Yes. You say you 
walked a post. Did you walk a post just in the

27:22.168 --> 27:26.413
dormitory, or did you walk posts outside, too? No, 
I never... Just in the dormitory.

27:31.159 --> 27:36.366
And the retired military people who assigned you 
your posts...

27:38.118 --> 27:42.104
Did they do anything in the way of instructing you 
to in military science? Oh, yes, yes. They told you

27:44.748 --> 27:49.715
how to go down and turn and how often to go around. 
Yes, they taught you how to handle your gun to start

27:51.177 --> 27:54.723
with.

27:57.907 --> 28:02.995
I gather the gun you carried on when you were on... 
post was not loaded? Oh, no, no, no. Did you ever

28:06.474 --> 28:09.660
have occasion to fire your gun? I mean, did you ever 
go to target practice or anything of that nature?

28:12.344 --> 28:13.346
No. Just marching, drilling? No, I don't think I 
ever had a shell the whole time I was there. I didn't

28:19.236 --> 28:21.700
want one. Never had occasion to shoot the light out 
over Old Main, over the Main building? No. Was that

28:25.466 --> 28:28.311
a practice while you were there? No. There was a 
period when it was a very popular thing to do. When I

28:32.704 --> 28:34.727
was there, they better not. They were pretty rough 
on us. They were strict. They shoot out what they

28:41.259 --> 28:46.389
call Prexy's Moon, the light on top of what was then 
the new main building.

28:49.234 --> 28:50.136
Not in our time. Not in your time, no. I suppose that 
was later when they had more students and less

28:52.064 --> 29:01.309
opportunity to control them completely. We 
worked hard. We were busy all the time. There

29:05.319 --> 29:08.267
wasn't a lot of foolishness going on.
