00:01.904 --> 00:05.307
Dr. Melcher says, Ms. Brown, it's really serious. 
He says, you know, this could kill you. I said, oh,

00:08.049 --> 00:10.431
Dr. Melcher, I don't think so. I said, I'm not going 
to get excited and worry about this. The law will

00:13.154 --> 00:15.856
take care of it. And so he said, well, come on. See, 
it was Saturday at noon then. He said, come back

00:20.801 --> 00:22.862
early Monday morning. So I came on home, studied my 
Sunday school lesson, went to Sunday school

00:23.323 --> 00:31.590
church, taught my Sunday school class, and acted 
just like I always did when he was scared. But

00:32.363 --> 00:39.172
Monday morning, I went back there, and like he 
said, he says, I have not been able to sleep hard

00:32.363 --> 00:39.172
this weekend worrying about you. And he said, I 
don't know what I'm going to do to get that poison

00:39.232 --> 00:42.376
out of your head. He said, I'm going to x-ray it 
again right now and see if it's gone away. And I

00:47.283 --> 00:50.648
said, all right, so he x-rayed it again, and it was 
still right there. And he said, well, I tell you,

00:51.889 --> 00:58.438
the only thing I know to do to get rid of it is to cut 
your head open, operate on it. I said, now, Dr.

00:59.414 --> 01:03.999
Melcher, I haven't been afraid until now, but I 
said, I'm scared to death now. I'm not going to have

01:04.019 --> 01:05.981
my head cut open my hole. So I said, you'll have to 
give me a few minutes, if you will, please, before I

01:07.382 --> 01:12.347
give you an answer about that. I'll have to go home 
and pray about it. I said, I have a Heavenly Father

01:15.870 --> 01:23.979
who works out my problems for me, and I said, I want 
to talk this over with Him and see what He says for me

01:15.870 --> 01:23.979
to do about it. So I keep a Bible on my kitchen table, 
And I came home and went to the kitchen table and sat

01:28.085 --> 01:31.910
down. My husband was living in those days. And I 
said, now, Father, you heard what Dr. Melcher had

01:34.733 --> 01:42.843
just said to me, and I want to ask you what I must do 
about it. He wants to operate on my head and cut it

01:44.225 --> 01:51.814
open and get the poison out, and I do not know what in 
this world to do, so please tell me. So I said, I'm

01:52.587 --> 01:58.517
going to again ask you to take my hands and tell me in 
the Bible what your answer is. So I turned to the

01:58.557 --> 02:06.411
scripture, and it said, Daughter, thy faith hath 
made thee holy, going peaceful. So I picked up my

02:06.431 --> 02:09.156
phone, and I first thanked the Lord. I knew that I 
was healed. I knew the poison was gone. I picked up

02:13.243 --> 02:17.751
my telephone right there on the kitchen table by 
me, and I said, Dr. Melcher, you don't need to worry

02:18.338 --> 02:20.040
about me anymore. I said, God has just healed my 
head. And he said, Ms. Brown, have you lost your

02:22.704 --> 02:25.547
mind? I said, no, I haven't lost my mind. I said, you 
know, I told you I was coming home to pray about it.

02:32.256 --> 02:33.517
And so I said, I did. And I said, God has just healed 
me. He said, will you please get in your car and come

02:38.784 --> 02:41.367
back down here? He said, I don't know what's the 
matter with you, but he said, I've got to examine

02:41.407 --> 02:45.392
your head again. So I went right straight back. I 
had been gone about 20 minutes. He accelerated

02:50.194 --> 02:53.017
again, and the party was gone. He said, Ms. Bryan, 
it is a miracle. I said, well, of course it was. I

02:58.563 --> 02:59.343
told you that. Then one day, we were going to have a 
vacation Bible school at our church, and the

03:01.706 --> 03:15.739
telephone rang, and the man who was in charge of the 
Bible school at our church said, Ms. Bryan, I want

03:01.706 --> 03:15.739
to ask a big favor of you. He said, we hope elected a 
woman to be principal of our Bible school. And he

03:19.903 --> 03:21.966
says, lo and behold, she's real sick. She's been 
put to bed. The doctor says she won't be well for

03:23.088 --> 03:26.312
maybe months. And he said, we don't have the 
faculty for the Bible school, and we don't have the

03:26.332 --> 03:31.259
literature. We don't have anything. And he says, 
I'm sick in bed with a blood clot in my leg. And he

03:36.727 --> 03:41.073
said, I just wonder if you would promise to be 
principal of Bible school. And he says, you know,

03:41.114 --> 03:43.577
it's just a month until it starts. Well, that is a 
tremendous job. You have to get about 125 workers.

03:48.761 --> 03:51.505
You have to honor the literature. You have to have 
all kinds of meetings and tell those women and men

03:51.545 --> 03:55.771
what they have to do. And you have a lot of 
advertising people. It's just a tremendous job.

03:59.976 --> 04:05.544
And I said, Mr. Griffin, I fell off my sideboard, 
that very one right over there yesterday. I got up

04:05.584 --> 04:09.329
there to pull that blind down, and I fell off the 
sideboard. And I said, I've got some broken ribs.

04:12.532 --> 04:17.517
And I said, I'm just suffering terribly with 
broken ribs this morning. He said, oh, isn't that

04:17.537 --> 04:19.179
just awful? I said, well, now, wait a minute. I 
said, Mr. Griffin, you know the Lord can heal my

04:20.660 --> 04:27.427
ribs if he needs me to be principal of Bible school. 
So I said, let's pray about it. So he said, well, we

04:30.310 --> 04:31.852
certainly will. So I just told the Lord, I said, 
now, dear Heavenly Father, if you need me to be

04:32.112 --> 04:42.403
principal of that Bible school, I'll do it if 
you'll heal my ribs, but I'm not able with broken

04:32.112 --> 04:42.403
ribs. So I had forgotten when it was two days of 
three. The Lord healed my broken ribs. And I went

04:50.842 --> 04:52.163
ahead. I was principal of Bible school. We got 
everything all ready on time. We had a wonderful

04:55.867 --> 04:57.169
school. Lost souls were saved. The girls and boys 
found Christ. I love them. And I went on to be

05:02.955 --> 05:08.221
principal the next two years after that. And then 
not so terribly long ago, my family had been here

05:08.241 --> 05:13.167
one night just Christmas Eve for Christmas 
dinner. And we had strawberry parsley for dessert

05:16.766 --> 05:20.091
with fruit cake. And, of course, that was 
Christmas Eve night, so the next thing was

05:21.514 --> 05:28.404
Christmas, and I was here by myself because my 
husband was gone. And I always let my son and his

05:29.165 --> 05:36.717
wife and their family have that veil for me to be 
with her family. And so I was here all by myself, and

05:37.539 --> 05:41.685
I went in the kitchen and ate the leftovers from 
Christmas dinner the night before, and I wound up

05:42.425 --> 05:47.170
with strawberry parfait. And the strawberries 
had been nice, crushed, but they were still, you

05:47.910 --> 05:52.915
know, big. They were still the normal size. And so 
one of those went the wrong way and got down in my

05:56.058 --> 06:02.825
windpipe or something down in my chest. I couldn't 
get it up, and I couldn't get it down, and I tried

06:02.845 --> 06:07.850
everywhere in this world. I caught, and I gained, 
and I went on. And that thing would not budge. So it

06:13.662 --> 06:17.187
was getting along toward dark that afternoon. I'd 
been playing around with that thing all

06:17.227 --> 06:21.392
afternoon, trying to do it myself. And I would say 
every now and then, I'd say, well, Lord, please

06:22.935 --> 06:26.259
help me. But I wasn't really praying. You know, 
real prayer is different from the way we pray

06:28.722 --> 06:34.230
sometimes. So it began to get dark. And I thought, 
well, I just got to go to the hospital. I was still

06:38.856 --> 06:40.258
here all by myself. So I got on my car and I drove 
myself down to the Brown Hospital. And there was an

06:45.044 --> 06:49.790
orderly and a nurse on duty. Everybody else was at 
home for Christmas dinner that night. Because

06:53.213 --> 06:54.375
that was Christmas Day. And so I said, what am I 
going to do? She said, there's not a doctor in the

06:57.478 --> 06:59.741
hospital. But she said, I'll call one and ask him to 
come and do something to help you. And I said, well,

07:06.175 --> 07:09.740
somebody's going to have to help me because I can't 
go to bed tonight. I couldn't even lie down. It was

07:10.602 --> 07:11.864
so uncomfortable. And I hadn't been able to eat. 
And so she called the doctor, and he wouldn't come.

07:17.452 --> 07:20.336
He didn't want to leave his family for Christmas. 
Then I couldn't blame him. But anyway, he said,

07:22.459 --> 07:25.885
give her a shot and tell her to eat a piece of bread. 
So I said, well, it's not going to be any good. I

07:29.310 --> 07:30.371
can't eat bread. I've been trying all afternoon to 
get something down. I said, I can't swallow it. And

07:35.150 --> 07:38.294
I said, I don't believe a shot was going to get in. So 
she gave me the shot, and it hurt like fury. And I got

07:41.979 --> 07:46.024
in my car and came on home, and it was just the same 
old thing. I couldn't eat any bread at all. So then

07:47.846 --> 07:53.373
it was getting along toward bedtime, and then I was 
going to really cry. So I said, Father, you know

07:53.413 --> 07:59.922
that I had been trying all afternoon to get rid of 
that strawberry. I said, I had been to the

07:59.942 --> 08:02.265
hospital. I tried to get a doctor, and he wouldn't 
come. And I said, I don't have any family. My

08:07.325 --> 08:09.307
husband's dead and in heaven. And my son is having 
Christmas with his wife and her family. And I don't

08:14.313 --> 08:15.815
want to disturb them. And I said, I have only you. 
And I said, you are sufficient. You're all I need.

08:24.344 --> 08:30.331
So I said, I'm going to ask you now to really get rid 
of this strawberry for me. So I went in the bathroom

08:30.391 --> 08:32.713
and gave myself again. And up came the strawberry. 
Oh. Then another time, I was hurrying to go to my

08:35.866 --> 08:44.534
circle meeting, a church meeting, you know, for 
women, where we studied the Bible. So I got all

08:45.455 --> 08:51.321
dressed and came downstairs, and my powder room is 
where I put my cosmetics on, my makeup. So I stepped

08:52.082 --> 08:53.663
in my elevator. I have an electric elevator. So I 
stepped in that elevator and pushed the down

08:56.046 --> 08:59.889
button, and it wouldn't budge. I mean, it got 
halfway down, and then it would not go any further.

09:03.833 --> 09:05.755
It just was hanging between the two floors. I tried 
to push the up button, it wouldn't go up. When I

09:09.197 --> 09:11.281
pushed the down button, it wouldn't go down. It 
just was hanging there between the first and

09:11.301 --> 09:15.067
second floor. So I jumped up and down trying to make 
it fall. And it was too far for me to jump. So I

09:22.980 --> 09:24.723
thought, what am I going to do? And my first thought 
was to panic. And then I thought, well, I don't have

09:27.327 --> 09:30.112
to panic. I have a Heavenly Father who can do all 
things. So I just bowed my head and prayed, and I

09:33.713 --> 09:41.445
said, Father, you know now what a predicament I've 
gotten myself in again. And I said, I do not have a

09:41.525 --> 09:44.470
soul in this world. I said, my friends are not going 
to come here because they all know I go to the circle

09:44.550 --> 09:48.776
on Tuesday morning. And my husband is dead. My 
son's already been here this morning for his

09:51.581 --> 09:54.505
visit. And I said, I haven't phoned for the plumber 
or the carpenter or anybody like that to come. So I

09:59.473 --> 10:02.117
said, I'll probably hang here until tomorrow 
morning. When my son comes back again, unless you

10:02.688 --> 10:11.240
help me, I said, now, Father, you are all in this 
world I need, so I'm putting myself in your hands. I

10:11.400 --> 10:15.045
said, you know, I can't even make my neighbors 
hear. I don't believe you. I said, it's

10:15.947 --> 10:17.108
summertime. They all shut up with the air 
conditioning going. And I said, I just don't know

10:20.473 --> 10:23.237
what you can do about it. Of course, so human, you 
know, I began trying to help God work it out. So I

10:28.104 --> 10:31.969
said, I'll tell you what, I think my 
daughter-in-law is the nearest one to me. So I

10:32.422 --> 10:35.045
said, of course, you could send her outdoors. And I 
said, of course, I'm not going to know when she

10:36.187 --> 10:42.374
comes outdoors because there was draperies 
hanging all in the windows and everything. But I

10:42.835 --> 10:45.698
said, Lord, you could tell me when she comes 
outdoors. And then I just screamed at the top of my

10:46.599 --> 10:48.782
voice. And I said, in the meantime, I'm just going 
to wait for you to tell me that she's come outdoors.

10:54.729 --> 10:57.973
So I stood there, I don't know how many minutes, not 
over six or seven. And all that time I was thinking,

10:58.898 --> 11:04.284
well, I know God's going to get somebody up here to 
help me. So in a few minutes he said to me, you know,

11:05.626 --> 11:11.212
God talks to you through your feelings. That's one 
way he talks to us. And so he just put the feeling on

11:14.716 --> 11:20.402
me just so plainly that I should call. He said to me, 
now call. She's outdoors now. So I just screamed

11:24.727 --> 11:27.470
normal at the top of my voice. That's my husband. 
son's wife's name. So in just about two seconds,

11:31.414 --> 11:33.957
she was at my back door. She said, Ruth, what is the 
matter with you? She said, what's happened? Are

11:38.181 --> 11:39.243
you sick or something? I said, no. Norma, I'm stuck 
in the elevator. I said, please go in my garage.

11:43.868 --> 11:47.132
There's a short ladder in there. And will you 
please bring the ladder so I can climb down the

11:47.652 --> 11:51.096
elevator? So she said, well, of course. So she I 
said, there's a key outdoors, and I told her where

11:54.907 --> 11:58.472
to get the key to unlock the door. So she came in and 
brought the flapper, and I climbed down out of the

11:59.152 --> 12:03.838
elevator. And I said, now, Mama, what were you 
doing a while ago before you heard me call you? She

12:09.686 --> 12:11.268
said, well, you know, it's the strangest thing. 
She said, I was in the house getting ready to

12:11.288 --> 12:13.971
shampoo my hair. I had my towel and my shampoo in my 
hand, and she said, all of a sudden, it just came

12:15.033 --> 12:22.783
over me that I must go outdoors. Oh. So she said, I 
didn't know what in the world I was going outdoors

12:24.370 --> 12:27.294
for. She said, I thought maybe something terrible 
was happening out there or something. But she

12:30.119 --> 12:34.064
said, something said to me that I must go outdoors. 
So she said, I went outdoors. And instantly, I

12:35.587 --> 12:37.349
heard you call. Oh. So if anybody ever says to me 
that they do not believe in prayer, I pay no

12:39.813 --> 12:46.603
attention to them. I try to tell them that they're 
wrong. God certainly does hear and answer prayer.

12:54.340 --> 12:56.382
And I don't know what this world I'd do without him. 
So in a worldly sense, I've had a very uneventful

12:56.442 --> 13:01.688
life. My life has been spent in spiritual ways, 
mainly. Of course, it's important. Which is the

13:08.115 --> 13:10.958
best kind of life in the world to have. You know, 
this life is so short. Now, you see, I'm almost 80

13:13.801 --> 13:15.563
years old. And of course, when you get to be 80, you 
don't expect to be around too much longer. Well,

13:20.750 --> 13:28.078
you'd think that, oh, woman, I've gotten to be fat 
and ugly and I'm not popular with the worldly

13:20.750 --> 13:28.078
crowd. They don't invite me to their cocktail 
parties because they know I'm not coming. And I

13:32.783 --> 13:34.365
wouldn't go if they invited me. And I wouldn't know 
what to do if I got there. I'd feel so

13:36.387 --> 13:37.868
uncomfortable. So I'm not popular with the 
worldly crowd, the society crowd. And I have

13:44.155 --> 13:46.397
arthritis in both my knees. And I don't get around 
like I used to. I don't go to any kind of parties

13:48.660 --> 13:50.622
anymore. And yet, I don't imagine there's anybody 
in this town that's any happier than I am. I don't

13:56.130 --> 13:57.232
see how they could be. I'm just warming up air all 
the time, and I'm so excited about going to heaven.

14:02.879 --> 14:04.120
I'm looking forward to it. And the other day, I was 
reading one of Billy Graham's books, Angels. And I

14:08.826 --> 14:18.218
believe it's in that book that he was telling about 
his mother's mother, his grandmother, was nine,

14:08.826 --> 14:18.218
and they had her propped up in bed. And she said, all 
of a sudden, she said, Oh, I see Jesus. I see heaven.

14:24.126 --> 14:27.109
And she says, and there is Ben. Ben was her husband 
who had died before. And I tell you, I just got so

14:30.592 --> 14:37.538
excited because I know my husband's going to be 
sitting there waiting to welcome me when I go to

14:30.592 --> 14:37.538
heaven. He said a few days before he died, he'd wait 
for me in heaven. And not too long ago, God let me see

14:42.102 --> 14:46.286
him in heaven in my dream. And I just really am 
excited about going to heaven. It's going to be the

14:51.352 --> 14:52.995
greatest day of my life. The only thing is, I 
haven't done enough work for the Lord. I'm not

14:57.121 --> 14:59.845
going to have enough gifts to take Him when I go. And 
I haven't won enough lost souls to Christ. So for

15:04.432 --> 15:09.059
that reason, I'm happy to stay here until He's 
ready for me to come. But as you see, my life has not

15:10.381 --> 15:19.435
been spectacular or fabulous according to the 
world's standards. And now I think I've told you

15:21.389 --> 15:27.113
about everything I know about insane.

29:49.490 --> 29:52.412
So is me too.
