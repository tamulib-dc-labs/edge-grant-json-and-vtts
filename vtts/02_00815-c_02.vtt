WEBVTT

00:02.275 --> 00:10.045
get a significant pay raise for the teachers in the 
amount of 28.5% at the upper level. It did take some

00:11.947 --> 00:19.196
convincing of the Senate when we got the 
conference committee to hold on to that amount.

00:21.439 --> 00:31.371
What we were able to do did not help me much with the 
school teachers when I met with them after the

00:21.439 --> 00:31.371
session.

00:36.616 --> 00:56.945
By 1981, the Texas State Teachers Association, 
which was the strongest arm of the teachers

00:36.616 --> 00:56.945
associations, Berkeley in Texas, had become 
aligned with the National Education

00:36.616 --> 00:56.945
Association. New alignment was forced upon them 
by taking a succession of votes, I understand

00:59.008 --> 01:05.678
about four,

01:08.307 --> 01:12.992
to join the National Education Association. The 
first three votes that the Texas State Teachers

01:14.935 --> 01:32.815
Association took, I understand they turned down 
joining the National Education Association, and

01:14.935 --> 01:32.815
it wasn't until the fourth vote that they finally 
succumbed. As a result, by 1981,

01:37.703 --> 01:55.948
competing teachers association had emerged and 
the speaker's motive was to work with and help this

01:37.703 --> 01:55.948
association in its accomplishments during the 
session. The speaker had not kept me informed on

02:04.822 --> 02:10.250
his motives and strategy with regards to teacher 
pay.

02:12.973 --> 02:20.484
And as a result, I had initially killed his 
proposal. Chairman of the committee, I

02:22.026 --> 02:33.242
controlled the agenda and with a little finesse 
was able to bring the proposal back before the

02:22.026 --> 02:33.242
committee. and get it passed for as much as a 28.5% 
increase, which the competing teachers

02:34.133 --> 02:45.126
association had requested. The chairman of the 
senate conference committee was not predisposed

02:46.387 --> 03:01.845
to provide as much salary increase as the house had 
in its bill when we got to the conference

02:46.387 --> 03:01.845
committee. But I was able to prevail upon the 
chairman of the Senate Finance Committee to

03:02.838 --> 03:23.462
accept the House proposal and provide for a larger 
teacher pay increase than was in the Senate bill. I

03:24.488 --> 03:42.295
was naive enough to think that with my support on 
more than one occasion for a significant pay raise

03:24.488 --> 03:42.295
that I might stand in good stead with the Texas 
State Teachers Association. but failed to take

03:42.865 --> 03:52.587
into account the rivalry that was taking place 
between the two competing associations, i.e. the

03:52.627 --> 03:58.360
two lobby groups for the Texas

03:52.627 --> 03:58.360
teachers. As a result, when it came time to make 
endorsements in my campaign for reelection in

04:00.533 --> 04:16.409
1982, the Texas state teachers quickly endorsed 
my opponent. In prior sessions of the

04:18.331 --> 04:29.342
legislature, I had to deal with the issue of how to 
get in a timely manner for

04:31.583 --> 04:44.539
computers and computer upgrades needed to do 
research at our major research institutions.

04:45.861 --> 04:51.148
Computers were first introduced in Texas state 
government. The Appropriations Committee

04:52.069 --> 05:00.139
through the leadership of a previous chairman had 
great difficulty in some of the decisions that

05:02.228 --> 05:10.402
some state agencies were making with regards to 
acquisition of computers. As a result, riders

05:11.704 --> 05:23.904
were placed in the appropriations bill that made 
it rather cumbersome to acquire computers for

05:11.704 --> 05:23.904
state agencies. In most cases, this was not a 
serious problem. more of an inconvenience for

05:30.106 --> 05:32.669
those agencies. However, in the case of major 
research institutions that were having to

05:33.971 --> 05:51.692
acquire computers and computer upgrades and 
software for research purposes, time was of the

05:33.971 --> 05:51.692
essence. and found the process of having to get 
approval from both the Texas State Auditor and the

05:52.769 --> 06:20.042
Governor's Office

05:52.769 --> 06:20.042
too time consuming to get the research project 
underway as

05:52.769 --> 06:20.042
required by contract with the federal 
government. struggling with this problem for

06:21.271 --> 06:35.295
several sessions, I asked for an interim 
committee to see if we could not come up with a

06:21.271 --> 06:35.295
better solution with regards to acquisition of 
computers. I quickly learned that it was going to

06:37.138 --> 06:47.295
take more time than I had as a part-time legislator 
to negotiate the

06:49.604 --> 06:51.406
that needed to be made.

06:54.450 --> 07:18.042
The Speaker of the House recognized this and when 
he was approached by a former member of the

06:54.450 --> 07:18.042
legislature who happened to be a member of the 
Texas A&M University faculty and was leaving that

06:54.450 --> 07:18.042
post here at A&M,

06:54.450 --> 07:18.042
the Speaker contacted me and asked me if I would put 
him to work. staffing this committee that had been

07:18.612 --> 07:25.340
appointed, that I was chairing. I was delighted to 
do so, and

07:26.762 --> 07:46.105
Jack Woods, a former member of the Texas House from 
Waco, meeting with the state auditor and the

07:26.762 --> 07:46.105
governor's office on numerous occasions, and 
keeping me advised of the progress that he was

07:46.540 --> 07:49.985
making. He was able to negotiate a

07:52.468 --> 08:16.142
from them to

07:52.468 --> 08:16.142
a bill that would create a new state agency called 
the Automated

07:52.468 --> 08:16.142
Information System Advisory Council. with 
appointments being made by the lieutenant

08:18.282 --> 08:23.830
governor, the governor, and the speaker. The 
council would be advisory in nature. It was

08:29.118 --> 08:45.201
constitutionally for

08:29.118 --> 08:45.201
the appointments to be made by the three principal 
officers in state government. The Information

08:46.345 --> 08:57.968
System Advisory Council was made law by my House 
Bill 1463. It was very favorably received by state

08:58.109 --> 09:04.662
agencies. State agencies needed help. in making 
acquisitions and found this new agency to be very

09:09.008 --> 09:19.644
helpful in getting the job done. Certainly in 
later years, the council has been revamped

09:21.888 --> 09:37.632
and given more power and longer advisory in nature 
This is unfortunate and I think has not been in the

09:40.092 --> 10:02.636
best interest of good government that now they 
have more power and are more intimidating to state

09:40.092 --> 10:02.636
agencies and as a result not near as helpful. In 
1982 during a special session The legislature

10:10.180 --> 10:27.747
finally did away with the old 10 cent ad valorem tax 
that was used to fund

10:10.180 --> 10:27.747
state universities and colleges outside of the 
permanent university fund. By then that the

10:29.129 --> 10:33.876
courts were going to rule that the ad valorem tax at 
state level was unconstitutional because it was

10:35.037 --> 10:43.610
not being uniformly applied across the state. 
School districts

10:44.912 --> 10:58.653
appraised their property values at extremely low 
rates while others were almost at true market

10:44.912 --> 10:58.653
value. As a result, the ten cent tax being applied 
to diverse rates

11:04.130 --> 11:18.404
going to cause the courts to rule the 10 cent tax 
unconstitutional. I may have been responsible

11:19.865 --> 11:31.116
for this special session since you will recall 
that some two years prior to special session, the

11:32.952 --> 11:57.627
governor had tried to convince me to back off of my 
opposition to a constitutional amendment at that

11:32.952 --> 11:57.627
time, which would have abolished the ten cent tax, 
which I had no problem with, but at the same time was

11:32.952 --> 11:57.627
giving Prairie View one-third of the permanent 
university fund. vehemently opposed and was able

11:59.243 --> 12:10.202
to garner enough opposition votes to keep the 
constitutional amendment from getting the

11:59.243 --> 12:10.202
necessary 100 votes.

12:13.928 --> 12:22.703
The special session of 1982, the governor was able 
to limit the call that he placed on the legislature

12:25.180 --> 12:52.774
for the special session to subject matter that did 
not deal with the permanent university fund

12:25.180 --> 12:52.774
therefore we had a clear up-and-down vote on a 
constitutional amendment dealing with the

12:25.180 --> 12:52.774
ten-cent ad valorem tax was during this special 
session that for the first time we were

12:53.632 --> 13:03.882
appropriating funds to a number of universities 
for

12:53.632 --> 13:03.882
construction directly from general revenue. As 
chairman of the House Appropriations Committee,

13:05.264 --> 13:21.360
I found this quite frustrating and dramatic

13:05.264 --> 13:21.360
in that it was very difficult to evaluate the need 
for various construction programs around the

13:21.965 --> 13:41.734
state as a member of the legislature who had not 
visited all of these facilities and did not have

13:21.965 --> 13:41.734
the expertise to evaluate one project against the 
other. Politics became a major factor in deciding

13:47.463 --> 13:54.555
who got the funds in that special session for 
construction projects. There was another

13:55.797 --> 14:08.357
situation similar to the regular session in 1977 
when the committee got out of hand.

14:10.750 --> 14:24.769
was making appropriations that I did not think 
could stand scrutiny and would exceed our budget

14:10.750 --> 14:24.769
that we had set aside for these construction 
projects. The outcome was quite different,

14:26.292 --> 14:28.955
however. I was able to let the members add these 
items and then, as chairing the conference

14:28.995 --> 14:38.108
committee,

14:41.851 --> 14:45.954
take the items out when we got to the conference 
committee level. Some danger in waiting until the

14:47.135 --> 14:59.166
conference committee unless you've had an 
opportunity to look at the version of the same bill

14:47.135 --> 14:59.166
or companion bill that the Senate has passed. It 
may not be an issue if it's both in the House bill and

15:00.187 --> 15:11.436
the Senate bill and would be very difficult to 
remove an item of this nature. wish that I had had

15:13.171 --> 15:35.356
the genius that has been later reflected

15:13.171 --> 15:35.356
in the appropriations bill passed in 1993 where 
such items were moved to an article that was not

15:13.171 --> 15:35.356
funded. The members were happy to be in the 
appropriations bill even though funds were not

15:41.622 --> 15:44.124
guaranteed for the projects. These were placed in 
1993 in Article 11, and some received

15:45.766 --> 15:59.178
appropriations later in conference committee 
and some did not. However, if no action was taken

15:59.918 --> 16:10.988
and they were left in Article 11, then they 
essentially fell out of the bill without having to

15:59.918 --> 16:10.988
take any action. 1982 was a re-election year that 
for the third time in

16:12.554 --> 16:26.851
my career I would have an opponent for 
re-election. The opponent had been a previous

16:28.473 --> 16:37.043
employee of the College Station School District, 
had been active in the local state senator's

16:38.390 --> 16:51.488
campaign to defeat a long-term incumbent and had 
gone to Austin to work on his staff during the

16:38.390 --> 16:51.488
regular session. After the session was over, he 
returned to Brazos County and worked for a local

16:51.808 --> 17:02.963
newspaper distributor.

17:05.305 --> 17:21.019
It was an interesting campaign in that my opponent 
had spent most of the regular session of 1981 in the

17:05.305 --> 17:21.019
House gallery keeping a tally of how I voted on 
various issues. It seemed like almost every day he

17:23.221 --> 17:33.591
had a new issue and kept changing the subject, so to 
speak, probably too often to have an effective

17:35.225 --> 17:44.396
campaign. He was able to raise money from around 
the state but primarily from other states to fund

17:45.397 --> 17:57.912
his campaign quite adequately. I think that the

18:04.638 --> 18:34.628
opposition really did not expect me to work very 
hard since i had been in the legislature for a

18:04.638 --> 18:34.628
number of years and was chairing uh... the most 
important committee in the house did not spend as

18:04.638 --> 18:34.628
much time as i had in previous campaigns but did 
feel like that i could uh... still conduct a rather

18:04.638 --> 18:34.628
effective campaign on a part-time basis for the 
first time I decided to run a poll but did not want to

18:34.895 --> 18:43.404
spend a lot of money bringing in a professional 
pollster. I got some help from a professional

18:45.526 --> 19:02.843
pollster as to how to conduct a poll and with a few 
volunteers we were

18:45.526 --> 19:02.843
able to get enough information to tell us that we 
were leading our opponent by about a two to one

19:03.363 --> 19:09.750
vote. Poster suggested that if I had that kind of 
lead that I should simply ignore the attacks of my

19:11.672 --> 19:25.687
opponent and just ride it out until election day. 
This is rather easy for a poster to say but it's

19:31.493 --> 19:56.573
difficult to do when you've got members of your 
campaign staff who are volunteers and close

19:31.493 --> 19:56.573
friends that are out working for you saying you 
need to answer him and you need to be more

19:31.493 --> 19:56.573
aggressive in your you're answering the 
opponent's attacks. I decided to answer him in a

20:03.760 --> 20:24.973
very general way as to how easy it was for a 
challenger to raise all these issues when he was

20:03.760 --> 20:24.973
not there and was not having to make the decisions 
that I, as the office owner, had to make. The polls,

20:26.050 --> 20:37.204
although not very scientific, did

20:26.050 --> 20:37.204
predict about how we were to come out in the race. 
Although we lost a lot of the minority boxes, we

20:37.945 --> 20:47.818
ended up with about 65% of the vote in that primary 
of 1982. Long about this time that the...

20:55.497 --> 21:06.818
So my family and some friends got together and 
organized and chartered Commerce National Bank

20:55.497 --> 21:06.818
in College Station, Texas. This was a national 
charter, but I did not think that the public would

21:08.922 --> 21:18.720
distinguish between a national charter where a 
state politician would have no influence, and a

21:19.105 --> 21:28.577
state charter where a state politician could have 
considerable influence. So I decided that I would

21:29.558 --> 21:44.758
not become a member of the original board of 
directors simply to downplay any political

21:29.558 --> 21:44.758
issues. that might accrue because I was serving on 
a bank board. It was later when I knew that I would be

21:53.058 --> 22:03.154
leaving the legislature that I became a member of 
the board of directors of Commerce National Bank

21:53.058 --> 22:03.154
and College Station. In the summer of 1982, I 
decided to take off for a 30-day period and study

22:10.675 --> 22:34.287
for the state bar exam to see if I could get my 
license to be a practicing attorney in Texas under

22:10.675 --> 22:34.287
an old law that had been passed many years prior 
with the The number of years I had in service as a

22:36.410 --> 22:52.346
member of the Texas legislature, I could sit for 
the bar, and if I could pass the exams, I could

22:36.410 --> 22:52.346
become a licensed attorney. Only about four or 
five members of the legislature had ever

22:54.027 --> 23:03.717
attempted to pass the bar in such a manner. Of those 
that did ultimately pass the exam and was granted a

23:04.709 --> 23:29.991
license, all attended

23:04.709 --> 23:29.991
law school for a period of time, but did not 
complete all the requirements to finish law

23:04.709 --> 23:29.991
school. developed that the Speaker of the House 
was studying

23:30.916 --> 23:44.278
for the bar at the same time and took the exam on the 
same day during that summer of 1982. The Speaker

23:44.298 --> 23:56.839
had

23:44.298 --> 23:56.839
previously announced just a month or so prior to 
the time we were studying for the bar that he would

23:58.220 --> 24:07.433
not be a candidate for a statewide elected office. 
He had a rather extensive farming operation and

24:07.453 --> 24:26.320
had decided to expand that operation even more 
extensively and did not feel like that serving as a

24:07.453 --> 24:26.320
statewide elected official would be compatible 
with his financial needs.

24:32.534 --> 24:47.952
At the very last minute, he declined to become a 
candidate

24:32.534 --> 24:47.952
for

24:32.534 --> 24:47.952
the General Land Office. 1982 also was a year that 
we had a race for Speaker of the House to replace Mr.

24:53.114 --> 25:00.787
Clayton. My deskmate for a number of years,

25:02.149 --> 25:11.786
Gibb Lewis, was a leading candidate for Speaker. I 
was not supporting it. Some years before, I had

25:16.030 --> 25:26.361
pledged to support a friend of mine for Speaker if 
he ever chose to run. And he had chosen to run and was

25:27.161 --> 25:41.616
opposing my deskmate for Speaker of the House. 
when the election was held in January of 1983. Mr.

25:45.844 --> 25:53.914
Lewis understood this, although he would have 
liked to have had my support. But I appreciate the

25:55.435 --> 26:05.307
fact that he never pressured me in any way to gain my 
support for his candidacy. It was late one Sunday

26:06.608 --> 26:10.793
evening. when I received a call from this friend of 
mine who was opposing Gibb Lewis for the

26:11.617 --> 26:19.850
speakership. And he told me that this

26:22.014 --> 26:38.080
candidacy for speaker had rapidly deteriorated 
the

26:22.014 --> 26:38.080
last couple of days. I had been out of the state and 
wasn't sure what was going on, but sensed that the

26:39.342 --> 26:54.984
wave of support was going in Mr. Lewis's favor.

26:58.148 --> 27:05.518
The Republican contingency in the House was 
lining up solidly behind Mr. Speaker. our Mr.

27:05.920 --> 27:12.010
Lewis and would put him over the top for our 
speaker. A friend who was opposing Mr. Lewis at the

27:13.392 --> 27:19.702
time suggested that I might want to call Mr. Lewis.

27:22.888 --> 27:27.996
I hung up, the phone rang again and On the other end 
was Gib Lewis, who was wanting to visit with me

27:29.056 --> 27:36.886
again about the speaker's race. I told him that I 
had just been talking to Mr. Uher, his opponent,

27:37.888 --> 27:54.490
who I was supporting, and that I had been released 
of any commitment to him.

27:55.786 --> 28:05.559
Mr. Lewis said that he would be in College Station 
the next day, and at that time I signed a pledge card

27:55.786 --> 28:05.559
to support him for Speaker. I realized that I was 
getting on the late train and would probably not be

28:07.722 --> 28:22.401
back

28:07.722 --> 28:22.401
in 1983 as chairman of the House Appropriations 
Committee. Later that year, when the speaker's

28:24.575 --> 28:40.121
race was all but over, I happened to be on a plane 
with Mr. Lewis, and we were flying to Corpus

28:24.575 --> 28:40.121
Christi. This was the first indication that I had 
that I would be his appointee for chairman of the

28:42.304 --> 28:50.498
House Appropriations Committee. The way he 
approached the subject, he asked me if I had any

28:52.267 --> 29:01.882
ideas about how I wanted to run the House 
Appropriations Committee next year. I told him,

29:03.364 --> 29:18.949
as a matter of fact I did, that I felt like it was time 
to put the CBOs, the Chairman of Budgets and

29:03.364 --> 29:18.949
Oversights, of the various substantive 
committees on the Appropriations Committee.

29:20.279 --> 29:43.013
This would do away with seniority in its entirety 
if the rules were written to put the CBOs on the

29:20.279 --> 29:43.013
committee, and this could be a problem to him 
politically and one that he would have to deal with

29:20.279 --> 29:43.013
before making that decision. probably want to 
talk to some of the senior members that had

29:44.478 --> 29:50.984
supported him for Speaker before making that 
move. A few weeks later he called me and we were

29:51.004 --> 30:14.265
talking and he told me that he had decided that was a 
good idea and that he would support that change in

29:51.004 --> 30:14.265
the rules that would put the CBOs on the 
Appropriations Committee. The downside to this

30:15.072 --> 30:35.110
approach of composing the Appropriations 
Committee of CBOs was the fact that the number of

30:15.072 --> 30:35.110
members of the committee had to be expanded from 21 
to 28. The addition of seven additional members

30:35.170 --> 30:44.438
did make the committee rather cumbersome. but in 
many ways caused a

30:45.025 --> 31:06.831
better information flow to the committee by 
having those that had heard detailed

30:45.025 --> 31:06.831
requests from the state agencies sitting on the 
Appropriations Committee. A few days prior to the

31:08.178 --> 31:27.081
1983 legislative session convening, my wife and I 
decided that we should for the first time take up

31:08.178 --> 31:27.081
residence in Austin during the session and move

31:30.250 --> 31:32.152
family to Austin for the session.

31:34.934 --> 31:59.076
We had one daughter who was then a high school 
student and had become involved in

31:34.934 --> 31:59.076
extracurricular activities and was having a 
medical problem that the doctors had been unable

31:34.934 --> 31:59.076
to diagnose. by making the move would give her a 
clean break with all the high school activities

32:00.338 --> 32:23.844
and give her a chance to readjust to a slower 
lifestyle than she had found herself involved in

32:00.338 --> 32:23.844
in a large public high school. We were able to 
locate an apartment close to a

32:28.722 --> 32:40.695
church school,

32:28.722 --> 32:40.695
provided all 12 grades. This proved to be good for 
our daughter since she did not have the hectic

32:42.377 --> 32:58.695
lifestyle and pace that she had created for 
herself in at Bryan High School. It was also good to

33:02.952 --> 33:14.087
be able to come home each evening and have my family 
there in Austin. The election of Gibb Lewis,

33:14.107 --> 33:26.944
Speaker, and Lieutenant Governor Bill Hobby 
returning to his post, the two agreed that each

33:14.107 --> 33:26.944
Monday morning They would have breakfast with the

33:28.274 --> 33:55.783
House Appropriations Committee, myself, 
Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee,

33:28.274 --> 33:55.783
Senator Jones, and the two chairmen of the State 
Affairs Committees, their respective houses.

33:56.624 --> 34:09.419
The idea was to rotate the breakfast between the 
Speaker's apartment and the Lieutenant

33:56.624 --> 34:09.419
Governor's apartment each Monday morning. After 
the breakfast meetings were convened, the

34:11.101 --> 34:20.893
Lieutenant Governor's apartment

34:24.130 --> 34:49.665
was destroyed by fire, which almost cost

34:24.130 --> 34:49.665
the state, its entire state capital because of its 
construction had not been modernized to the fire

34:24.130 --> 34:49.665
from sweeping through the entire capital. The 
fire was contained just in the Lieutenant

34:50.911 --> 35:05.345
Governor's office and apartment and

34:50.911 --> 35:05.345
caused them to vacate those facilities.

35:08.748 --> 35:15.894
Bill Harvey did not live in the apartment himself, 
so there was no problem as far as quarters were

35:08.748 --> 35:15.894
concerned. The consequence of the fire The 
decision was made that the Monday morning

35:19.362 --> 35:32.217
breakfasts would be held in the speaker's 
quarters for the duration of the session. These

35:33.678 --> 35:48.255
meetings were particularly helpful in 
developing a strategy for the session and

35:33.678 --> 35:48.255
in getting artists

35:33.678 --> 35:48.255
lined up for the session. The priorities of the 
House and the Senate do not always coincide, but it

35:50.980 --> 36:12.606
was good to know what the two houses were thinking 
and where there could be agreement and some

35:50.980 --> 36:12.606
resolution worked out on certain major issues.

36:16.467 --> 36:31.264
It was partially as a result of one of those Monday 
morning breakfasts that I found myself going to

36:16.467 --> 36:31.264
the hospital and spending a few days for the first 
time since I was two years old. This particular

36:32.626 --> 36:44.500
Monday morning, I had arisen a little earlier than 
usual and had coffee at the apartment with my wife.

36:45.560 --> 36:55.632
I arrived at the Capitol ahead of everyone else but 
for the kitchen help in the Speaker's apartment. I

36:57.814 --> 37:10.369
had time to drink another cup or two of coffee 
before the arrival of the Speaker, Lieutenant

36:57.814 --> 37:10.369
Governor, and the other legislators.

37:12.526 --> 37:33.971
During breakfast, I unconsciously drank some 
more coffee,

37:12.526 --> 37:33.971
left the meeting and the House Appropriations 
Committee for a hearing on the appropriations

37:12.526 --> 37:33.971
request of the Texas A&M University System. 
During the hearing, I had time to drink another cup

37:40.842 --> 37:48.075
of coffee and the next thing I knew I was on my way to 
the hospital. Took about three days in the

37:49.317 --> 37:59.816
hospital to determine that my heart was in good 
condition and that I had no problems. One of the

38:00.878 --> 38:05.466
concerns the doctor had was that I had not had a

38:08.618 --> 38:17.411
check up for quite some time and was not familiar 
with my history with regards to my heart. It was

38:19.894 --> 38:34.896
finally determined that I did have a slight heart 
murmur, but it had been with me all of my life and was

38:19.894 --> 38:34.896
not anything to be concerned with. With the 
exception of the three days I spent in the

38:36.344 --> 38:49.301
hospital, the time

38:36.344 --> 38:49.301
that I spent chairing the Appropriations 
Committee was rather pleasant that session. The

38:51.604 --> 38:57.252
conditions was tight, but not extremely so. The 
state's economy appeared to still be in good shape

38:58.974 --> 39:05.743
in early 1983. And the revenue projections were 
adequate that we did not need to make any

39:07.495 --> 39:16.626
significant reductions. The chair of the Budget 
and Oversight Committee did see fit to make 3%

39:17.988 --> 39:28.081
across the board reductions for all of higher 
education. And with the exception of some of the

39:34.546 --> 39:41.136
agencies within the Texas A&M University system 
did not create a serious problem. It took some

39:43.680 --> 40:02.730
gentle persuasion and education on my part to 
convince the chairman of the Budget and Oversight

39:43.680 --> 40:02.730
Committee when he took a 3% reduction of the total 
appropriations of an agency that was receiving

40:03.503 --> 40:12.674
only about ten percent of its appropriations from 
general revenue that he was cutting general

40:03.503 --> 40:12.674
revenue rather dramatically. Once this was 
accomplished we were able to get the bill out of

40:14.456 --> 40:24.688
committee and into conference committee with 
some ease. A major issue that the conference

40:26.870 --> 40:30.034
committee had to deal with was the difference in 
appropriations methodology for some of the

40:30.115 --> 40:43.789
medical schools at MD Anderson in the University 
of Texas system. The chairman of the Budget and

40:45.330 --> 40:55.701
Oversight Committee had reported that rather 
significant large sums of unexpended balances

40:55.850 --> 41:09.468
existed within the

40:55.850 --> 41:09.468
medical school budgets of the University of Texas 
system. And that there was no reason that we could

41:09.488 --> 41:18.900
not appropriate some of those funds and still 
allow them to do the things they wanted to do. The

41:20.863 --> 41:23.106
University of Texas had a different idea, but 
apparently decided to leave this issue until the

41:23.660 --> 41:38.241
conference committee met

41:23.660 --> 41:38.241
to work out the differences between the House and 
the Senate bills. As we approached the deadline

41:39.844 --> 41:52.182
for finishing the conference committee report on 
one Sunday afternoon, this issue still remained

41:39.844 --> 41:52.182
one that the House and the Senate conferees could 
not agree upon. In the meantime, Lieutenant

41:57.207 --> 42:10.066
Governor Bill Hobby had come to the conference 
committee room and was beginning to work with his

41:57.207 --> 42:10.066
Senate conferees. I immediately called the 
Speaker to who was on the golf course, to come to the

42:18.301 --> 42:23.127
Capitol and help us resolve this issue.

42:25.830 --> 42:37.786
We finally had to, by

42:25.830 --> 42:37.786
ourselves, from view of the public and the media, 
to have a frank discussion with regards to this

42:25.830 --> 42:37.786
issue. The University of Texas officials 
convinced us that they could not live with the

42:48.153 --> 43:06.292
reductions that the House made, but were willing 
to make some reductions in those unexpended

42:48.153 --> 43:06.292
balances by allowing us to appropriate them as a 
part to replace general revenue. A decision was

43:07.814 --> 43:15.882
made as to what the amounts would be that we would 
use from those unexpended balances in the health

43:16.435 --> 43:22.323
science centers. We proceeded back to the 
appropriations

43:24.146 --> 43:39.507
committee room to reconvene the conference 
committee and take a formal and final vote on the

43:24.146 --> 43:39.507
issue. This, by the way, was the only time that I can 
recall that the conference committee did, in

43:40.904 --> 44:01.174
fact, violate the rules and make a tentative 
decision in

43:40.904 --> 44:01.174
closed meeting. It became an official meeting 
because all the conferees were present at the time

44:02.470 --> 44:12.425
the discussion took place.

44:15.791 --> 44:18.876
The meeting was held in the Lieutenant Governor's 
office. Reconvening the conference committee in

44:20.939 --> 44:26.267
the House Appropriations Committee room, I made 
the motion that the amount that had been

44:27.209 --> 44:38.927
previously agreed to would be made a part of the 
Conference Committee report. The chairman of the

44:40.289 --> 44:55.393
Senate Finance Committee and the chairman of the 
Conference Committee took a vote with all five

44:40.289 --> 44:55.393
senators voting for the issue, while on the House 
side, I was the only with the other four voting in

44:57.719 --> 45:01.404
the negative. Totally surprised and appalled at 
the outcome of the vote, which meant that the issue

45:02.946 --> 45:12.919
was still unresolved. Later explained to me that 
the other four conferees had left the meeting in

45:21.277 --> 45:39.157
the Lieutenant Governor's office with the 
Speaker and they were still complaining about not

45:21.277 --> 45:39.157
appropriating what the House had originally put 
in this bill with regards to these unexpended

45:21.277 --> 45:39.157
balances. The Speaker's response, I was told, 
was, well, do whatever you want to. The other four

45:47.534 --> 45:56.442
house conferees agreed to vote against my motion. 
The next morning I got the speaker to speak to the

45:56.462 --> 46:16.461
house conferees and tell them that we had to get 
this issue resolved and that they needed to vote

45:56.462 --> 46:16.461
for the amounts

45:56.462 --> 46:16.461
that had been agreed upon in Lieutenant 
Governor's office. the only unresolved issue in

46:16.981 --> 46:31.820
the bill and we could not report the bill out and get 
it passed during the regular session if it was not

46:16.981 --> 46:31.820
resolved very quickly. The Speaker agreed to 
speak to the other conferees and the issue was

46:33.162 --> 46:41.132
quickly resolved and for Fourth time in a row, the 
biennial appropriations bill was passed with no

46:42.766 --> 46:57.113
new taxes, certified by the comptroller and 
signed into law.
