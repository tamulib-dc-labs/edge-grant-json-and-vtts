WEBVTT

00:00.959 --> 00:06.184
So you saw them coming and you were getting ready to 
attack? Yeah, we were getting ready to attack. And

00:08.346 --> 00:09.747
how many were you? Was it just your tanks? In my area 
of responsibility, they had ten German tanks and I

00:11.589 --> 00:20.438
think I had full strength. I had fifteen or sixteen 
anyway. The platoons were in pretty good shape.

00:28.651 --> 00:32.035
They come out as if they were going to attack me. And 
what they're doing, they're dragging those 10

00:32.055 --> 00:34.979
tanks. They drug four anti-tank guns behind them 
and put them in a position in which we couldn't see.

00:42.989 --> 00:45.612
Dig them in in the sand and get them set up. And then 
as they dropped off these, they're moving on

00:47.014 --> 00:52.501
toward us. And we start exchanging fire. And they 
withdraw. And their tactics is for me to go charge

00:59.026 --> 01:07.636
it in there and get them, you know, as they pull out. 
And they draw me right into these four anti-tank

01:08.297 --> 01:12.943
guns. Well,

01:12.963 --> 01:23.715
I had, you know, you have to study the enemy or 
you're foolish if you don't. So we had... read

01:27.292 --> 01:32.939
about this, of them doing this against the British 
down in Eighth Army. And I talked to my executive

01:35.262 --> 01:43.932
officer, the lieutenant of the captain. I said, 
you know, I think we better be careful. I said, I

01:51.502 --> 01:55.847
think we better send one platoon off around this 
flag here. feel this situation out, and I said, we

01:56.165 --> 02:00.552
better stay here and overwatch them. Okay. Well, 
that's exactly what happened. They hadn't moved a

02:07.142 --> 02:20.502
thousand meters until they started drawing fire 
from these anti-tank guns that these guys,

02:07.142 --> 02:20.502
jokers, had dropped off there and put nets over, 
sand-colored nets. When they did that, we just

02:20.802 --> 02:29.838
poured the fire from the rest of our tanks right in 
on them and brought the artillery in on them and

02:20.802 --> 02:29.838
killed every damn one of them. I never lost a tank. 
Then we just moved out on through them and we

02:32.101 --> 02:37.090
engaged the Germans at that. So then you started 
chasing the Germans after that? Well, we started

02:40.716 --> 02:45.865
moving them and waiting for our other elements to 
move up and we went forward.

02:51.177 --> 02:53.620
Most of them got away. We knocked out a few. I can't 
remember now, three or four of them, but most of

02:54.922 --> 02:58.327
them would get away. You just don't go chase each 
other in the desert. You just don't know what the

03:02.893 --> 03:04.315
hell. You just can't afford to get yourself out on a 
goddamn limb as a part of the team.

03:12.426 --> 03:14.630
And so the whole line of assault was moving. Yeah, 
everybody moves. What you do is you take

03:17.473 --> 03:20.037
intermediate objective. You take your 
objective, and when you get orders to move your

03:20.759 --> 03:35.280
next objective, it means you don't move there 
until the commander decided that everybody's on

03:20.759 --> 03:35.280
his intermediate objective, and you just keep 
moving forward. You have objectives to... Sure.

03:38.725 --> 03:40.207
Every guy's got an objective. If this guy's on his 
objective, it may enhance the movement of these

03:40.287 --> 03:50.682
others to get on the objective, but you don't let 
this guy go on to the next and next and next until

03:40.287 --> 03:50.682
everybody... because this guy could end up 
getting himself cut off out there and screwing up

03:52.012 --> 03:59.102
the whole damn plan of action. When did you next see 
some combat? Then we saw combat on the way into...

04:02.106 --> 04:11.900
We were in and out of combat almost every day until 
the campaign was over. In the Kass area? Yeah,

04:14.104 --> 04:15.405
yeah. And on into Brazardia and Tunisia. And then 
from Sicily— Wait a minute now. Were the Germans

04:25.056 --> 04:29.884
basically doing defensive tactics? Yeah, 
falling back. Falling back slowly, just trying to

04:31.766 --> 04:38.857
hold you— Falling back, and the damn Italians, 
they were giving up. They were poor fighters. They

04:41.241 --> 04:45.728
were a hell of a liability the Germans had.

04:46.703 --> 04:58.762
They'd try to give up in the evening, you know, when 
they'd smell us out cooking some, brewing up some

04:46.703 --> 04:58.762
coffee or something outside the tank late in the 
evening, you know, heat up some meat or something,

04:46.703 --> 04:58.762
you know, canned meat or something. They'd smell 
that. They'd be laying away over there in the

04:59.723 --> 05:02.187
desert. They'd come in under a white flag and want 
to give up. And... Have some dinner. They just

05:09.118 --> 05:10.300
wanted something to eat. Hell, they don't fight. 
They complained about the Germans... They

05:15.172 --> 05:26.144
complained about the Germans wouldn't repair 
their vehicles in the workshop, and they didn't

05:15.172 --> 05:26.144
have vehicles that were in bad shape, and they 
couldn't fight very well. Hell, they couldn't

05:26.685 --> 05:32.872
have fought very well if they'd had brand new 
vehicles.

05:32.892 --> 05:33.332
God. But anyway, they were a hell of a liability.

05:39.699 --> 05:43.744
I asked a German lieutenant colonel we'd captured 
one time about how well those Italians fought. He

05:47.956 --> 05:51.620
said, well, from what I see, about like you're 
American Negro. Well, I'll tell you what, he

05:53.202 --> 06:07.757
didn't know American Negro as well as I do, because 
I tell you, I had some hellacious fighters out of

05:53.202 --> 06:07.757
the American Negro, I'll tell you that.

06:12.580 --> 06:15.063
How'd you get along with some of the captured 
Germans? Did you ever talk to them? Well, I almost

06:17.647 --> 06:35.972
went to jail over an Italian lieutenant general in 
Sicily who wanted to take all of his steamer trunks

06:17.647 --> 06:35.972
to the prison camp with him, and he refused to get 
him back in a two-and-a-half-ton truck with about

06:17.647 --> 06:35.972
50 other Italians. He complained, and 
Eisenhower, I guess, had it all investigated.

06:41.338 --> 06:53.573
Anyway, nobody could ever find out who the guy was 
that asked the sergeant to put this guy on board and

06:41.338 --> 06:53.573
get him down to LSD and to hell with his damn steamer 
trunks. They just never did find out too much about

06:53.633 --> 06:58.259
who in the hell that was. Maybe they purposely 
didn't want to find out. But I didn't have much to

07:04.586 --> 07:06.769
do. As the war went on, I did a lot, I guess, for 
German soldiers that were wounded.

07:15.843 --> 07:21.993
I tried to take care of every one of them as I would 
expect him to do my soldier.

07:24.877 --> 07:26.941
Did you give them pretty good care then? Oh, 
absolutely, absolutely.

07:31.589 --> 07:38.156
As you know, the commanders carried morphine 
syrettes after a battle was over. I remember one

07:38.256 --> 07:48.246
battle,

07:38.256 --> 07:48.246
November 16th, 17th, and 18th of November 1944. 
One of my tanks had blown up a German assault gun.

08:00.665 --> 08:12.616
The one soldier still alive had been blown out of 
the thing, and his leg was all gone, and he was

08:00.665 --> 08:12.616
bleeding to death except a piece of skin. So I took a 
surgical kit that I carried with me, cut that leg

08:12.736 --> 08:24.547
off, put a tourniquet on it, cut that leg off, 
covered it with sulfanilamide powder. That's

08:24.628 --> 08:26.910
about the only antibody we had. Give him a shot of 
morphine. bound that up, called my doctor, Swab,

08:29.825 --> 08:46.163
forward, Captain Swab, hello, great little 
surgeon, and he brought up a half-track, armored

08:29.825 --> 08:46.163
half-track, picked him up, and saved his life. 
That's what I'd expect them to do for me. And I think

08:51.188 --> 08:58.296
that they did, in every instance that they had the 
capability to do, but you've got to understand

08:51.188 --> 08:58.296
that If you don't have capability, you can be 
accused of a lot of things. A German soldier was

09:05.861 --> 09:19.556
having a hell of a time from

09:05.861 --> 09:19.556
1944 onward for supplies and something to eat.

09:23.841 --> 09:26.764
They were just having a hell of a time.

09:28.634 --> 09:35.943
So sometime I guess our people didn't receive 
proper care because it wasn't there. Now let's

09:37.225 --> 09:38.967
switch to Sicily. Did your command change?

09:46.958 --> 09:56.430
I was put in a position as a company maintenance 
officer for a maintenance company because of my

09:46.958 --> 09:56.430
background. and was later promoted to major just 
after the Sicilian campaign.

10:06.554 --> 10:10.579
I was responsible for the maintenance of the 
entire regiment. I kept that through Sicily. In

10:14.623 --> 10:18.048
other words, they took your command away then? No, 
I was given another command, but one in which a

10:18.068 --> 10:24.055
major commanded instead of a captain. Oh, I see. 
The maintenance company had 12 tanks in it, in

10:26.752 --> 10:47.040
addition to all the maintenance capability for 
the whole regiment, 156 times three and the same

10:26.752 --> 10:47.040
number of half-track vehicles.

10:49.604 --> 10:52.088
The Sicilian campaign lasted about a month. I 
supported that operation. Then we left every

10:56.182 --> 11:02.088
vehicle behind and went to England. Got into 
England in November, Thanksgiving Day, in

11:02.108 --> 11:08.354
Burrock, Scotland. And there we began to totally 
re-equip. And now my maintenance experience, I

11:11.538 --> 11:17.584
can understand now what they were doing, what they 
had in mind. I didn't know at the time. But then—

11:20.347 --> 11:25.632
Were you sad that you weren't going to be on an 
invasion of Italy? They had decided that the

11:26.523 --> 11:34.616
Second Armored Division and the First Infantry 
Division were going to go to England, so we did. The

11:34.656 --> 11:40.266
Second Armored and the First Infantry. The only 
other division in my lifetime that I wanted to

11:40.286 --> 11:50.843
serve with in combat that I had great admiration 
and respect for other than the Second Armored

11:40.286 --> 11:50.843
Division was the First Infantry Division. And 
would you believe, my first general officer, I had

11:51.565 --> 11:57.954
a general officer assignment when I was the first 
infantry brigade in Vietnam. I was very happy

11:58.695 --> 12:02.820
about this whole thing throughout my 36 years.

12:06.886 --> 12:09.810
So you went up to England in November of 43. Yeah, I 
got there on Thanksgiving Day. And we started

12:12.914 --> 12:19.463
receiving new equipment, later model equipment, 
totally. It took every day we had until we took off

12:20.877 --> 12:34.209
and loaded up down at Portsmouth for the invasion. 
Were you in on any of the planning or were you just

12:36.551 --> 12:40.135
basically maintenance? Oh, I had all the planning 
for all the maintenance and logistic side of it.

12:50.628 --> 12:52.670
before my regiment. And then we went to,

12:54.492 --> 13:15.555
we were in Normandy, and I kept that maintenance 
company until October

12:54.492 --> 13:15.555
the 1st,

12:54.492 --> 13:15.555
1944. And then I become commander of the second 
battalion, the tank, the second battalion of the

13:17.257 --> 13:28.268
67th Armored Regiment. Tank battalion now, a 
whole battalion. Now, tell me about Normandy.

13:33.414 --> 13:35.116
When did you go on D-plus-1? D-plus-1, yeah, 
D-plus-1. And we were bombed severely and killed a

13:37.938 --> 13:46.167
Sergeant Major there. And we

13:47.547 --> 13:56.158
fought the hedgerows. You see, I had 12 tanks of my 
own. And we got all, everybody got involved in the

14:00.464 --> 14:09.235
St. Louis breakthrough.

14:12.151 --> 14:38.428
One of the reasons I guess I went to the 2nd 
Battalion when I took a battalion, when I got

14:12.151 --> 14:38.428
around to being eligible to be promoted to 
lieutenant colonel and they wanted to give me a

14:12.151 --> 14:38.428
battalion on the 1st of October of 1944 was I had 
many times taken my 12 tanks out of the maintenance

14:38.948 --> 14:43.054
company as such and went with the 2nd Battalion. So 
I knew them very well and worked with them very

14:44.236 --> 14:47.001
well. As far as the battalion was concerned, what 
was your response? About how many tanks were you

14:52.229 --> 14:54.713
responsible for? I had 57

14:54.733 --> 15:00.682
tanks, 3 assault guns. That's a total of 60. I had

15:08.902 --> 15:16.873
then had a task force that usually gave me from one 
company to two companies of infantry. And during

15:19.176 --> 15:37.862
the drive

15:19.176 --> 15:37.862
from the Rhine River to the Elbe River, I had a, 
remember now I'm a major, still, about to be

15:38.551 --> 15:44.778
promoted to lieutenant colonel, but I'm a major. I 
had attached to me a battalion of infantry,

15:46.300 --> 16:01.838
commanded by a lieutenant colonel, and a direct 
support battalion of artillery, 105

15:46.300 --> 16:01.838
self-propelled artillery, commanded by a 
lieutenant colonel. I had a tank destroyer

16:03.640 --> 16:07.765
company, and I had a reconnaissance troop and I'm a 
major, and I command this whole entire task force

16:08.470 --> 16:17.778
with two lieutenant colonels under me in support. 
How is that possible? It's a matter of, I guess, of

16:21.261 --> 16:26.686
who can do what. And rank has not anything to do with 
it when you really get the responsibility. It's

16:33.312 --> 16:36.655
kind of like a brigadier general, you know, 
commanding a division.

16:41.900 --> 16:44.084
Absolutely. It just never happened in a 
peacetime. Never happened. But wartime, that's

16:48.751 --> 16:50.194
different. Who can do what? Exactly. Who can do 
what? That's what it's all about. That's the

16:56.664 --> 17:06.861
reason why sometimes I've had, even in a Vietnam 
conflict, I've had a little private command in a

16:56.664 --> 17:06.861
rifle company. because he had the radio and the 
company commander was down here somewhere and

17:07.820 --> 17:14.471
couldn't get to the damn radio. And I said, son, 
you're in command as far as I'm concerned. Now

17:18.959 --> 17:20.141
here's what we're going to do.

17:23.046 --> 17:27.173
Well, a little private doing that. Why not? All you 
got to do is do what I tell him to do.

17:37.452 --> 17:38.333
That's the way it goes. That's the kind of little 
guy that, when he does a hell of a good job, as soon as

17:40.877 --> 17:54.175
you can, go land down there and pin a damn medal on 
him and help him send it back to his mama before he

17:40.877 --> 17:54.175
gets killed.

17:57.160 --> 18:03.529
It's no fun presenting medals to mamas and papas 
posthumously. Let him send it home while he's

18:04.570 --> 18:06.733
alive.

18:11.506 --> 18:14.230
What was the first action that you saw after 
Normandy?

18:20.058 --> 18:23.343
Then the daylights bombed out of us, I guess, by 
Luftwaffe. They were very active. We were

18:27.949 --> 18:34.138
supposed to have air superiority, but our air 
superiority was so high that they had air

18:27.949 --> 18:34.138
superiority.

18:37.780 --> 18:40.183
We had the bombers, but they had the fighter 
bombers. Yeah, that's right. And they were

18:40.724 --> 18:44.468
ME-109s and FW-190s. Oh, yeah. And the one that hit 
us was a HE-111

18:45.750 --> 18:56.843
with a 4,000-pound bomb. And that was kind of a 
record. It brought out the whole air ministry from

18:58.505 --> 19:02.910
England to look at the crater. There were chunks. 
It went so deep that there were chunks of clay, not

19:05.651 --> 19:16.986
square, but we'll just use, for example, 10 feet 
square. That'd be about the size of this room here,

19:17.146 --> 19:20.511
I guess. It came down and burst open a half-track, 
armored half-track vehicle. That's how deep and

19:26.078 --> 19:28.802
how big it was. The crater across the top was 
about... 40 meters I guess. This was really a load

19:37.984 --> 19:44.273
and it must have been a delayed fuse that they had on 
it. We saw him coming and he was very low level and of

19:45.234 --> 19:55.487
course we had 50 calibers to shoot at him but we 
never did hit anything. We shot at one ME-109 when

20:00.400 --> 20:04.724
we were on the, we just got in on the beach. It was D 
plus one, early on D plus one. And we began to spread

20:09.049 --> 20:12.673
out and get ourselves sorted out. Here come a 
ME-109 and everybody started firing at him and

20:12.693 --> 20:23.244
they killed a Spitfire that was following him, 
that was chasing him. So you see how bad things can

20:23.304 --> 20:25.506
get. And this kind of upset the Brits, RAF. But this 
HE-111 came in. We were shooting at him. It didn't

20:34.460 --> 20:35.743
make any difference. He was very low, I'd say a 
thousand feet. Boy, he hit right in the middle of

20:40.671 --> 20:44.317
the second battalion. But everybody spread out 
and just tore up the battalion headquarters.

20:51.590 --> 20:56.378
But then the St. Louis.

20:56.729 --> 21:02.354
How many of these tanks were damaged on an attack 
like that? Well, it busted up five of the

21:02.375 --> 21:11.323
half-track type armored vehicles in the 
headquarters and turned over two tanks. Through

21:13.345 --> 21:18.951
Major Smith, the executive officer, about a 
hundred meters.

21:22.034 --> 21:23.395
Did he survive? Yes, sir, and let me tell you 
something. He went to the hospital, and they let

21:26.921 --> 21:32.647
him come back in about a week, 10 days. And I was a 
commander then of the battalion, and he was my

21:32.707 --> 21:38.874
executive. Everybody, you know, people 
complained to me about him being irritable. They

21:44.861 --> 21:48.585
said, Major Smith, he's kind of irritable. He's 
always irritable. Nothing suits him. That's what

21:52.484 --> 21:57.852
some of the company commanders said to me. I said, 
well, I'll talk to him. And I said, I appreciate you

22:02.719 --> 22:04.802
telling me. So I was sitting down with him one 
evening. We had a hard day. And I said, Smitty, how

22:11.531 --> 22:13.214
do you feel? He said, well, I'll tell you. He said, 
that German artillery today just tore me up. Every

22:19.417 --> 22:23.802
round of that artillery just seemed like my head 
was breaking open. I said, well, look, when did all

22:23.922 --> 22:27.466
this start? He said, after we got bombed down on the 
beach.

22:33.413 --> 22:42.864
I said, would you relent to going back to the 
hospital and getting this checked out again and

22:33.413 --> 22:42.864
then come right on back? He said, well, it's 
getting to where it hurt me so bad, I think I'll I

22:49.572 --> 22:52.436
think I'll, I don't want to leave. I want to come 
back. I said, okay, well, let's go get this checked

22:53.537 --> 22:56.742
out, and then you can come back. Named Jerome 
Smith, one hell of a great guy. And he went back, and

23:03.210 --> 23:06.835
they found a hairline crack in his skull. He'd been 
living with this now for about six months, and I can

23:06.995 --> 23:12.122
imagine artillery tearing him up. Gee whiz. Isn't 
that something? Hairline crack in his skull that

23:14.846 --> 23:17.790
they hadn't found before. So he had to come back. 
You just don't know how much pain a guy goes through

23:22.364 --> 23:25.868
at that sort of time. But he didn't know, you know. 
So he went on to come on back to the States.

23:38.243 --> 23:43.229
But

23:38.243 --> 23:43.229
Normandy was a nightmare.

23:46.113 --> 23:47.254
After the breakthrough,

23:50.761 --> 23:53.024
Germans scattered all over the place. They were 
trying to withdraw, and we were getting orders to

23:54.105 --> 23:57.409
move.

24:02.475 --> 24:05.619
I get around to Brits. Brits are wonderful guys and 
soldiers, but their high command is so

24:07.801 --> 24:19.215
methodical, and they take so much time, and 
they're so careful. And you know, to the Brits,

24:21.473 --> 24:30.143
hell, what difference did it make to them whether 
the war lasted five years or fifteen years? You

24:31.264 --> 24:33.867
just thought that the British were much too slow 
then. That's much too slow. So you agreed with what

24:35.449 --> 24:38.713
Patton had to say about Montgomery? Absolutely, 
absolutely. Take advantage of the breaks that you

24:40.415 --> 24:47.043
see on the battlefield and exploit them. Besides 
that, what did you think of their soldiering? Oh, I

24:51.292 --> 24:54.696
thought they were fantastic soldiers. Oh, yes. 
Fantastic system for training their officers and

24:56.198 --> 25:04.909
their men, but they just, God damn it, are slow as 
hell. And

25:06.791 --> 25:14.761
they take their time about what they're doing. 
They do a good job, but my God, they're slow.

25:18.916 --> 25:35.682
Anyway, at Barrington, I was sent around behind at 
Barrington, France, to close off the Falaise Gap

25:18.916 --> 25:35.682
Park.

25:39.628 --> 25:46.999
I never will forget, too, a couple of my tanks were 
occupying a roadblock where we had the Germans

25:39.628 --> 25:46.999
trapped. in the fillet's pocket. This was before 
we crossed the river and headed on up toward

25:51.972 --> 25:58.180
Belgium.

26:03.588 --> 26:16.986
Here came two old armored cars up the road, and my 
guys were ready to, they had one German come down,

26:03.588 --> 26:16.986
and they let that German get down within 100 meters 
before they blew his motorcycle up They blew a

26:18.923 --> 26:23.569
motorcycle up with a tank gun? Yeah, they hit him 
with a 75 millimeter about 150 meters or

26:23.589 --> 26:32.401
something like that. Well, I guess it was an hour or 
so, here came these two armored cars and they were

26:32.421 --> 26:46.821
about to get it when we had a radio set up on a British 
radio that was supposed to tie up with

26:47.324 --> 26:54.876
it. So these two tank crews were told that there was 
a possibility of British, so we let them come up and

26:54.976 --> 27:03.289
challenge them. It was in the daytime, so they came 
up and we identified them as British. You know, one

27:16.788 --> 27:26.122
of my sergeants, they were from, they were tanked 
from a vehicle from across the street there. He

27:26.964 --> 27:29.367
said, hey, where you limeys been? And he said, 
don't limey me, we're Canucks. He's from Canada.

27:38.261 --> 27:44.871
And then we pulled the hell out of there and got 
going and getting ready to go to, uh, They got their

27:45.155 --> 27:46.116
break. We got that broke through, and they had 
squeezed up a bunch of Germans

27:46.176 --> 27:53.547
in there, and so everybody started moving. They 
went up to Belgium, Porte-Brasil, Antwerp, and we

27:53.567 --> 28:08.808
headed off toward Liège and Maastricht, Holland, 
and into Germany across the Siegfried Line. Now

28:09.008 --> 28:12.293
tell me, what impact did the Battle of the Bulge 
have on you? Yeah, well, I was a battalion

28:12.931 --> 28:17.256
commander then. And

28:17.316 --> 28:22.762
first off, we had fought. Were you a part of the 
Third Army then? No, I was still in the Second

28:25.265 --> 28:33.995
Armored Division, but it took it away from Bradley 
and gave it to Montgomery, my part of it, up to

28:25.265 --> 28:33.995
North. Now I'm under Montgomery. So you were under 
Montgomery. Yeah, I'm now under Montgomery. I

28:39.361 --> 28:40.542
took it away from Bradley. Preceding involves, by 
a month, we had jumped off on the 16th of November

28:43.053 --> 29:06.833
between the Siegfried Line, we were past the 
Siegfried Line, between the Worm and the Rohrer

28:43.053 --> 29:06.833
River, and we were fishing up that place called 
Lenik and Julik on the Rohrer River. And Julek

29:08.332 --> 29:17.785
sports plots, which has been recorded in history 
as a great hangout, holdout for the Germans there.

29:18.687 --> 29:28.340
We moved, I was commanding the battalion then, and 
we attacked on the 16th, 17th. I finally took my

29:28.360 --> 29:30.704
objective on the 18th. And as the 66th Regiment and 
the 67th Regiment and I had the 2nd Battalion of the

29:37.103 --> 29:46.333
67th Regiment, jumped off, pushed the Ruhr River 
at 8 o'clock on the morning of the 16th.

29:49.236 --> 30:03.752
Two German tank regiments, we found out later, 
jumped off from their positions at 8 o'clock in the

29:49.236 --> 30:03.752
morning to push us back across the Ruhr River.

30:06.989 --> 30:28.468
And that's probably one of history's meeting 
engagements

30:06.989 --> 30:28.468
where a light force is one going to attack the other 
force and the other force jumps off unknowingly to

30:06.989 --> 30:28.468
this and neither one of them know and they have a 
meeting engagement.

30:28.488 --> 30:30.610
With approximately the equal number of tanks. 
Equal number of tanks. I think there's more than

30:34.373 --> 30:36.355
500 in there.

30:39.710 --> 30:46.177
And they had, it was mud, it was coal.

30:48.961 --> 30:52.725
We had no air support. We had tremendous artillery 
support. Did the Germans have any air support left

30:56.730 --> 30:58.932
by them? No.

31:02.056 --> 31:05.700
They dropped their last bomb on me on the 6th of 
October, as far as I know. I never got bombed any

31:09.209 --> 31:11.431
after that. And that was by a jet aircraft. A jet? A 
jet aircraft on the 6th of October, 1944, which

31:16.616 --> 31:32.312
turned out later to be a Me 262, one of the first jet 
aircraft in the world.

31:37.169 --> 31:43.599
He dropped this bomb on a hedgerow over here, and I 
was on a trail here with a jeep, and it blew this air

31:37.169 --> 31:43.599
out. This one, I guess, busted this one. Didn't 
kill anybody and blew us out of the jeep, all three

31:49.288 --> 31:53.955
of us. I was up at the head of a column of tanks 
moving. I kind of used my, I had a Jeep with command

31:57.959 --> 32:02.264
radios in it. I had a light tank with command radios 
in it. I had a half track with command radios in it. I

32:07.510 --> 32:10.094
had a medium tank with command radios in it. And 
that represented my golf bag of tools. Depending

32:14.519 --> 32:17.382
on what the situation was is what I got in. What did 
you think when you saw it jump? Well, I knew she was

32:22.048 --> 32:25.772
awful fast and you couldn't see any props. And I 
said, man, this looked like another rocket. But

32:28.773 --> 32:31.096
how can a rocket carry a bomb? It was only about a 
250-pound bomb. How can a rocket carry a bomb?

32:38.124 --> 32:39.185
That's what I thought. Well, let's get back to your 
engagement now in December of 1944.

32:45.973 --> 32:48.316
Two equal forces are heading toward each other. 
Yeah, okay. A guy named Batchelder, he had 56 tanks

32:49.718 --> 32:56.586
and a tank destroyer company had 12 tanks. with 
90-millimeter guns. Our old tanks had

32:58.538 --> 33:04.345
76-millimeter guns and 75-millimeter guns. He 
had a destroyer company. I had a tank destroyer

33:06.909 --> 33:10.653
company. No, I did not have a tank destroyer 
company. I had a platoon of four, 90-millimeter.

33:20.285 --> 33:21.807
When we jumped off, they jumped off. Harry 
Hilliard He had the First Battalion.

33:32.423 --> 33:34.485
We all started out with 56 tanks. But Batcheller 
had a whole company of tank destroyers out of the

33:36.206 --> 33:41.071
701st Tank Destroyer. I believe he had, at least I 
know he had a platoon, because he had one tank

33:41.091 --> 33:46.736
destroyer that hit. It was a diesel engine, 
something that I'd recommended for the whole Army

33:47.417 --> 33:54.383
back when I was testing them in the desert, that we 
have diesel engines. It was hit 13 times before

33:55.105 --> 33:58.309
they were caught on fire. Of course, there was 
nobody alive in it anyway, but it was shot up 13

33:58.329 --> 34:05.638
times because the Germans determined they were 
going to set every one of our tanks on fire.

34:07.200 --> 34:13.307
Batchelor ended up out of his 56th battalion with 
19. 19 surviving tanks. 19 surviving tanks, and

34:14.648 --> 34:22.598
some of those had weapons busted on them, you know, 
a shell fragment that cut them up. I had

34:24.029 --> 34:27.313
thirty-three left. Healyard had twenty-one. Now 
out of my thirty-three, most of the main gun would

34:30.356 --> 34:44.813
operate on, but some maybe the coaxial fifty 
caliber or thirty caliber wouldn't work on

34:30.356 --> 34:44.813
because of the shell fragments and the plus 
amount. I was ordered then to go take the major main

34:44.833 --> 34:49.378
objective of their strength assault. How did the 
Germans do? Tell me in this. Okay, Germans. Was it a

34:56.900 --> 34:58.582
field or a forest? No, it was a wide open mud 
terrain. A few scattered little villages. Low

35:06.194 --> 35:17.712
clouding, clanging clouds, foggish, muddy, 
cold, November type, northern Europe.

35:21.758 --> 35:26.044
In the afternoon, it was a kind of a Spanish 
standoff. In the afternoon, their two major

35:27.386 --> 35:42.948
regiments started withdrawing, and they 
deployed their 505th Heavy Panzer Battalion,

35:27.386 --> 35:42.948
which had 22 Tiger Royals. Tiger Royals had the 
88-millimeter gun, but my God, they had so much

35:43.029 --> 35:51.681
armor on them that instead of weighing them, 40 
tons. They weighed up to close to 60 tons. So they

35:56.191 --> 35:57.293
were pretty slow. Real slow and forklift-like 
guys. But good maneuverability in the mud. They

36:05.485 --> 36:06.767
deployed those. One of my sergeants, if that had 
got into us, you see, our guns wouldn't penetrate

36:07.688 --> 36:19.225
their tanks. We had to The only way we'd penetrate 
their tanks really is to get up within 800 yards of

36:20.197 --> 36:27.532
them, 4 to 800 yards. And with those 88-millimeter 
guns, they'd penetrate us out 1,000 yards, 1,200

36:27.633 --> 36:33.725
yards. So it made a hell of a—hell of a— So what did 
you do, stay back? Well, no, we just pounded the

36:40.015 --> 36:50.292
hell out of them and just keep fighting them and 
maneuver again and try to get on their flanks, you

36:40.015 --> 36:50.292
know, and hit them in the flank where they're soft 
instead of taking them head on. It was hard to

36:50.713 --> 36:59.467
maneuver and they were maneuvering to beat hell in 
that mud with a big wide track and our tracks were

36:50.713 --> 36:59.467
much narrower. But anyway, we just kept pouring in 
there and One of my little sergeants, this is

37:02.941 --> 37:22.550
probably a historical mark, fired 32 battalion 
time on target of 105, 155, 8-inch gun, 8-inch

37:02.941 --> 37:22.550
howitzer. An 8-inch howitzer round is 298 pounds. 
A gun round, I believe, is a little heavier, about

37:25.614 --> 37:31.142
the same, I guess. 96 pounds on a 155 and a lesser 
amount on a 105. But 32 battalions, 32 times 12

37:38.218 --> 37:45.408
times 18 in some instances. This would give you 32 
times 12 is a good balance. That number of guns were

37:49.774 --> 37:55.603
the rounds all hitting and exploding at the same 
time. A little sergeant did that. Brought all that

37:58.847 --> 38:00.690
artillery in. Artillery in World War II was the 
best arm that we had in our army. In Vietnam, it was

38:08.232 --> 38:10.315
the lousiest. That's how we progressed with our 
artillery. All rounds hit on those 22 tanks at the

38:15.924 --> 38:21.052
same time. No kidding? Every round burst at the 
same time. This was so devastating.

38:32.041 --> 38:41.512
to those tanks that they left three dead ones and 
they had two or three cripples and the rest of them

38:32.041 --> 38:41.512
withdrew. That's what firepower will do for you. 
Then it went on until— So your artillery was behind

38:47.039 --> 38:54.308
you shooting over you— Over me, absolutely. I 
never got a chance to engage them. It wouldn't have

38:56.771 --> 39:00.495
done any good anyway because they'd have knocked 
me out.

39:02.990 --> 39:04.753
Soils. It killed us. Soils. Day after day after day 
after day of the utilization of massive

39:07.839 --> 39:16.213
firepower. And that's been a key to my whole 
tactical philosophy. of used firepower, you make

39:22.312 --> 39:25.837
that by hand. Don't use soldiers. They're 
important. They're made by God, grace of God. So

39:31.204 --> 39:33.848
why use something important? People are 
important. Use some cheap materialistic thing.

39:37.813 --> 39:48.849
So did you, as far as your tanks were concerned, did 
you try to hold them back then and just continue to

39:37.813 --> 39:48.849
maneuver while the Tigers were pounding at you? 
No, what we did, this was late in the day, Now the

39:52.265 --> 39:59.136
other two regiments that attacked us withdrew, 
and they were using this as their last gas, and they

39:52.265 --> 39:59.136
withdrew. Why did they withdraw? Because of the 
artillery? No, because of our tank action. We

40:04.484 --> 40:07.088
killed a lot of their tanks. I see. Because you 
could deal with it lighter. Yeah, they're

40:10.313 --> 40:11.435
lighter. They're Mark Fours and Mark Fives,

40:11.475 --> 40:19.487
yes. It's

40:21.796 --> 40:30.893
getting dark, and we're consolidating our 
losses, getting casualties back. We're

40:30.933 --> 40:37.966
refueling, re-ammoing, trying to get our stuff 
together, and still keeping the artillery on

40:30.933 --> 40:37.966
them. And next morning again, we jump off during 
the night. The assessment's made.

40:46.180 --> 40:55.112
Hollingsworth, Task Force Hollingsworth, you go 
take Gernsweiler, their regimental objective,

40:46.180 --> 40:55.112
or the combat command B objective. So I did. How 
many tanks did you have left, 33? 33. So you took

41:01.241 --> 41:02.963
your 33 tanks? Yep, and went on and took the 
objective. And what was defending the objective?

41:09.732 --> 41:10.574
Not too much. A few German tanks, most of them had 
withdrawn. but the most devastating artillery

41:14.513 --> 41:19.380
that I had received during the war. So the Germans 
were waiting for you then? The Germans were

41:24.107 --> 41:32.539
waiting for us, and they occupied the high ground 
on the other side of the Ruhr River.

41:33.060 --> 41:41.112
They had the observation on me, and I had to go take 
that objective anyway. How many casualties did

41:41.547 --> 41:43.310
you take? I had

41:45.152 --> 41:55.728
four more, about five more tanks hit from enemy 
artillery. Before you could wipe out their

41:57.951 --> 41:59.733
artillery? Yeah, before we could get our 
artillery in range to hit them.

42:10.184 --> 42:13.048
I don't know how many people I had dead and wounded. 
I had a lot of wounded, but not so many dead. And I

42:19.917 --> 42:26.366
had, while we were, I had an assault gun. That was a 
105 short barrel gun on a M4 tank chassis. I had

42:32.814 --> 42:36.740
three of those in the platoon to fire indirect. 
They could fire direct, but they made to fire

42:36.760 --> 42:39.904
indirect. They represented just a half of a 
battery of artillery in that part. The artillery

42:46.699 --> 42:52.665
was so bad, the enemy artillery was so bad, they 
were hitting, destroying everything. One round

42:54.427 --> 43:00.713
hit right next to my headquarters, which is in this 
little old village of Gernsweiler. We tried to

43:01.914 --> 43:10.262
remote our radio down into the basements, you 
know, To save the soldiers, we'd just leave a radio

43:11.896 --> 43:20.487
outside in the armored vehicles with the sandbags 
and that sort of stuff around the tank. We'd just

43:20.547 --> 43:25.794
remote those down in there and operate from down in 
there. Infantry and the tanks married up out to

43:27.015 --> 43:34.565
defend the Gernsweiler. And a round came in, a very 
heavy round, a 150 caliber bore. And it hit on the

43:42.727 --> 43:47.832
deck of one of those assault guns, and the little 
guys were down inside. And I knew that round had hit

43:47.892 --> 44:00.965
very close, so I get outside, and sure enough, in 
the midst of this heavy concentration, it hit this

43:47.892 --> 44:00.965
tank. I got up on the back end of that tank. They had 
clothing, and they had camouflage nets and that

44:04.368 --> 44:10.955
sort of stuff, and that stuff was all on fire. And I 
kicked this fire off. in that artillery and got

44:13.321 --> 44:34.487
down in the tank and the little guys was all right 
and I said you can either stay out here or you can

44:13.321 --> 44:34.487
come with me down in this basement because there's 
no way you can fire out here accurately and do any

44:13.321 --> 44:34.487
good with this incoming artillery like it is. They 
said sir we'll stay in here don't you want to stay

44:38.093 --> 45:00.996
with us I said no I said I've got this fire out out 
here now you're going to be all right and I'll go

44:38.093 --> 45:00.996
back I said I got to get back and get on that command 
radio so I do in about a month's time I get called up

44:38.093 --> 45:00.996
to the and things was quieted down, I guess, in not 
quite a month's time. We pulled into a place called

45:07.630 --> 45:19.487
Oad Wilder to get refitted and get ourselves 
sorted out and we were gonna have Thanksgiving

45:07.630 --> 45:19.487
dinner down there, whatever it was. Christmas 
dinner? No, Thanksgiving, because this battle

45:21.089 --> 45:31.624
was over and then on the 18th or 19th we got pulled 
out and we went into a little old town just south of

45:21.089 --> 45:31.624
there named Oad Wilder Eighteenth or nineteenth
