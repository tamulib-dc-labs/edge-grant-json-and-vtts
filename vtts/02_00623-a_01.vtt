WEBVTT

00:01.904 --> 00:08.414
Might as

00:01.904 --> 00:08.414
well get the lights back on. Follow. You know, I've 
been looking at my watch all the time. I have to keep

00:11.339 --> 00:13.082
track of the length of the tape. It's got a ring, but 
it doesn't do so. Did you get viewing before you

00:15.005 --> 00:18.290
died? No, I did not. And, you know, his brother 
taught at A.D. He's here down the hall. He is. John?

00:26.242 --> 00:27.945
No, his brother, who was a historian. I didn't

00:29.579 --> 00:36.971
know about that. First series of questions, this 
will follow really a biographical filing

00:36.991 --> 00:43.020
chronologically in format. First series of 
questions concern how you developed an interest

00:43.040 --> 00:48.349
in oceanography and what led you to oceanography. 
And so, would you briefly discuss your career as it

00:48.369 --> 00:55.280
leads up to your meeting with Francis Shepherd? 
That's pretty easy. I lived in Dallas and Fort

00:58.520 --> 01:09.933
Worth, and it was convenient for the first couple 
years to go to North Texas Agricultural College. I

01:09.953 --> 01:15.499
was pretty good in math in high school, so I thought 
I'd be an electrical engineer. And so I took the

01:16.420 --> 01:27.092
first two years of electrical engineering 
courses, and that's all I was taught at NTAC. And I

01:27.477 --> 01:36.044
had time for a couple of electives, so I took 
historical geology and physical geology from one

01:27.477 --> 01:36.044
of the math instructors. His name was Shirley 
Lynch, who later went to A&M. And I got quite a bit

01:40.648 --> 01:48.595
interested in the geology, so I thought I'd then 
combine the electrical engineering and the

01:40.648 --> 01:48.595
geology. The only way I could think of combining it 
was as mining engineering. So I went to University

01:53.860 --> 01:56.742
of Illinois. on Lynch's recommendation. And, of 
course, I wasn't funded or anything. And so

02:04.927 --> 02:16.799
normally people who didn't have much money in 
those days would get a summer job to make enough

02:04.927 --> 02:16.799
money to pay tuition, books, and so forth, and get 
other jobs when they went there. Several of us had

02:16.819 --> 02:25.767
worked at the World's Fairs, say, in Chicago in 
1934 and in San Diego in 19... 35, mainly because

02:25.983 --> 02:32.872
World Fairs were places of new employment, and 
therefore they're a new job. So we earned enough

02:32.892 --> 02:40.281
money then to work to go to school the next year. So 
anyway, a couple of us worked in San Diego, then

02:40.922 --> 02:52.036
rode the freights and the trike and so forth to 
Urbana, Illinois. And the first job that's

02:52.056 --> 02:55.500
necessary is to get one that provides food, and 
waiting tables, and busing, and so forth. The next

03:01.597 --> 03:04.262
point is to get a job that provides money. And I had 
done drafting before, so I got a job with Francis

03:04.322 --> 03:13.138
Shepherd at that time, drafting, making maps. And 
then, of course, I took mining engineering

03:13.158 --> 03:19.530
courses and more geology. And it became evident 
after I'd been down a couple coal mines that

03:20.084 --> 03:28.655
geology was more interesting, straight geology. 
So I switched to straight geology for the

03:28.875 --> 03:33.682
bachelor's degree. And then about that time,

03:34.302 --> 03:41.832
Shepard and I started on a big map of California. 
And I spent the summer of 1936 in Washington. at the

03:47.489 --> 04:00.233
coast within the coast genetic survey making 
large-scale maps that later had to be reduced to a

03:47.489 --> 04:00.233
common scale and that increased the interest of 
course in oceanography and then shepherd had a

04:00.803 --> 04:09.593
$10,000 grant that provided for a year of ship time 
at Scripps and other things. And so alternate

04:10.353 --> 04:16.080
semesters, we'd go from University of Illinois to 
Scripps. And so then that provided—at that time,

04:16.100 --> 04:24.769
then I decided to go to oceanography all the way to 
marine geology. Those trips provided an

04:25.711 --> 04:36.707
opportunity for master's degrees and doctor's 
degrees for both Robert Dietz and me. So we were in

04:36.727 --> 04:43.697
the mainstream then of them.

04:43.717 --> 04:45.961
This is a check of tape recorder number two. The 
break in the tape is due to a switch in the tape

04:47.563 --> 04:51.769
recorder after one seemingly malfunctioned. Can 
we start over again? No, it's all right. It can be

04:56.779 --> 04:57.380
made out. It's not any problem with that, with what 
we've done. I just don't want to take a chance on it

04:59.502 --> 05:02.766
getting progressively worse as we go through. It 
seems to be getting worse, yeah.

05:08.192 --> 05:11.835
The spindle was driving at too rapid a rate of 
speed, but this one seems to be moving more slowly.

05:12.076 --> 05:13.617
What sort of man was Francis Shepard? What was he 
like when you met him, and what did he do to inspire

05:13.838 --> 05:19.303
you to enter oceanography? Well, he was a The 
shepherd, when I first met him, was probably 38 or

05:21.668 --> 05:28.741
thereabouts, at least as I recall. And he was very 
energetic. He was motivated by research. And I'd

05:36.115 --> 05:45.111
never met somebody who had been motivated by 
research before, because at North Texas

05:36.115 --> 05:45.111
Agricultural College, the people were mainly 
interested in teaching and not research. And it's

05:46.019 --> 05:51.486
just a little bit of a different world, different 
interests, and so forth. The amount of effort that

05:51.927 --> 06:00.018
one will spend to find out, to learn something, was 
surprising to me. Though I had tried something

06:01.160 --> 06:08.490
like that once before, just and so forth. And I was 
much impressed by it. devotion to marine geology

06:11.146 --> 06:17.333
that he used, and the interest of other people in 
what he was doing. What about Robert Dietz? He and I

06:21.038 --> 06:35.676
were students at the same level, and Dietz

06:21.038 --> 06:35.676
was a very good fundamental thinker, interested 
in the basics of things. I was sort of more

06:37.678 --> 06:39.280
interested in the a slightly different approach, 
more in seeing what the distribution of things

06:39.648 --> 06:48.636
were and making deductions from that. We made a 
good team. We worked together for three or four

06:49.977 --> 06:57.603
years, together aboard the ship and also as 
roommates in Illinois. We actually stayed at the

06:57.723 --> 07:06.631
Shepherd's Attic, in the Shepherd's Attic, by the 
way, for two years, I guess. When you arrived at

07:06.651 --> 07:09.013
Scripps, doing that first summer. How large was 
it? Well, it had seven professors. There was just

07:17.295 --> 07:21.381
one student, John Lyman, if I remember rightly. 
There were a few other people who were there for

07:22.843 --> 07:31.696
part of the time, but getting their degrees, I 
think, at other places. But the seven professors

07:31.756 --> 07:36.683
was really pretty small. It was headed by... a 
Norwegian, Harold Sverdip. And Fleming was

07:41.829 --> 07:55.546
there, and Johnson, both of whom collaborated 
with Sverdip on the book called The Oceans, which

07:41.829 --> 07:55.546
really didn't take a lot of time, but it was quite a 
fundamental contribution to the knowledge of the

07:41.829 --> 07:55.546
ocean. Other people who were there were Zoe Bell, a 
bacteriologist, and Chambers, a meteorologist,

08:07.533 --> 08:09.335
McEwen, a physical oceanographer.

08:12.258 --> 08:14.240
I think those are the ones. What was your reaction 
to your first time at sea? Did it convince you more

08:18.745 --> 08:22.929
to be an oceanographer? Yes, I guess the first time 
at sea was aboard DW Scripps. That ship had just

08:27.114 --> 08:30.578
been bought by Scripps Institution. It was a 
schooner. The topmasts were taken off and part of

08:32.480 --> 08:35.683
the bow spread. The mainsail boom was hoisted to 
make room for a winch. And the first sailing was

08:41.942 --> 08:49.757
from San Diego to Catalina Island. It was sort of a 
show-and-tell cruise. Now I would not expect very

08:52.563 --> 08:55.589
much to come of it, and nothing did. It was taking 
several people out. out in the ocean just to

08:58.816 --> 09:03.282
demonstrate the new ship. But I'd had quite a bit of 
small boat experience before that with Shepard

09:03.302 --> 09:13.116
taking soundings in the La Jolla Canyons and in 
other places. I wasn't seasick.

09:18.905 --> 09:20.487
When did you first meet Roger Revelle? probably 
1938, because I went to Scripps as a shepherd the

09:22.103 --> 09:35.927
first time in about the middle of 1937, and Ravel 
was in Norway at that time, finishing out a year

09:22.103 --> 09:35.927
after he got his doctor's degree. And I was well 
impressed with Roger Ravel, and still as a broad

09:37.370 --> 09:46.466
thinker.

09:46.646 --> 09:47.267
When you're 37, 38, what sort of direction do you 
think your career is going to take? What sort of

09:52.030 --> 09:54.533
interest do you think you're going to pursue in 
oceanography?

10:01.583 --> 10:07.732
Well, it was clear that it was going to be marine 
geology because my basic training was in geology.

10:07.752 --> 10:11.938
And that has to be the case for anyone successful in 
oceanography, not to be... not to be divided

10:12.577 --> 10:25.749
completely amongst all the fields, but to 
concentrate in one of the fields and know enough

10:12.577 --> 10:25.749
about the other fields in order to operate 
successfully in interdisciplinary fields. And

10:26.189 --> 10:35.817
as a matter of fact, a year aboard the sailing ship 
was very good in that connection because people on

10:26.189 --> 10:35.817
sailing ships learned to live with the sea instead 
of in spite of the sea. In fact, that probably is the

10:36.418 --> 10:42.263
chief reason why many nations have square-rigger 
sailing ships as... as training ships for at least

10:42.732 --> 10:49.462
part of their midshipmen to be. And we're living 
with the ocean and close to it. You have a better

10:54.269 --> 11:00.739
understanding of the physical oceanography and 
the meteorology and the biology and the rest of it.

11:00.779 --> 11:03.904
And that's where we're from.

11:04.565 --> 11:08.571
Did you intend to make an academic career, that is, 
teach from the very beginning?

11:12.803 --> 11:16.007
Well, you know, these are questions that I 
probably never asked myself. And as a matter of

11:16.728 --> 11:26.800
fact, it had been only a couple years before that I 
changed from electrical engineering to mining

11:16.728 --> 11:26.800
engineering to geology to marine geology. So this 
means that anything I thought about what I'd do 10

11:26.820 --> 11:33.668
years later wouldn't have much bearing. But at 
that time, of course, marine geology wasn't

11:33.688 --> 11:38.254
really a separate science. There were no, there 
really was only one course for us on how to talk, and

11:38.892 --> 11:47.220
that was by Shepherd at Illinois.

11:47.240 --> 11:57.269
But it would have been, should have been, would 
have been clear to me that there was, at that time,

11:47.240 --> 11:57.269
there was no other avenue for working in that than 
being a professor. And as a matter of fact, in 1938,

11:57.910 --> 12:05.777
after I got to know Roger Revelle quite well, he 
advised me against going into the field. wisely

12:06.922 --> 12:09.628
enough, because he knew there weren't enough jobs 
in it. There weren't at that time. It was only after

12:11.372 --> 12:15.762
World War II that the Navy realized that it had to 
know something about the ocean. So basically,

12:15.862 --> 12:24.863
that's what started the trend in increasing size 
in marine geology, size of profession. Now, your

12:26.328 --> 12:31.356
first job, though, in 41, is that of teaching 
geology, is it not? No, the first job in 1971 was

12:31.696 --> 12:39.147
making electrical earth resistivity surveys 
looking for groundwater in Illinois. And I held

12:39.508 --> 12:40.589
that. That was from the time of Dr. June, 71, in 
June, 41, to... February of 43. The problem there

12:52.404 --> 12:58.293
was that the Navy really didn't know much about the 
ocean at first. And work was being done through

12:59.075 --> 13:07.087
Scripps at what was called the University of 
California Division of War Research, which was in

12:59.075 --> 13:07.087
San Diego. Shepard was there. Ravel started 
there. Fleming was there. And others whom I knew

13:12.235 --> 13:14.539
well. Johnson was there. And other people from 
other places. Well, what happened was that that

13:20.480 --> 13:43.802
the first of the work that was done there was 
recognition of the effect of bottom sediments on

13:20.480 --> 13:43.802
the character of anti-submarine sonar searches, 
and then later pro-submarine devices,

13:20.480 --> 13:43.802
pro-submarine strategy and tactics, more or 
less. Excuse

13:43.822 --> 13:46.905
me. Now, this had come about because Shepard and I 
had made a map of the—I'd better say it another

13:51.057 --> 14:01.849
way—Shepard had made maps of the distribution of 
bottom sediments on the East Coast while I was

13:51.057 --> 14:01.849
still an undergraduate. And I drew them up into 
patterns of bottom sediments. And then later on,

14:06.495 --> 14:12.822
when I was at Scripps with Shepard, then we 
together made bottom sediment charts of that

14:06.495 --> 14:12.822
region. It became evident that in acoustic 
warfare that acoustic ranges were very large very

14:15.982 --> 14:45.887
long over sand bottom because the sound bounced 
from one point of contact in long hops might have a

14:15.982 --> 14:45.887
range of three or four thousand yards whereas over 
mud the mud absorbed the sound about like deep

14:15.982 --> 14:45.887
water would and so the ranges were short maybe only 
a thousand yards over rock bottoms there's so much

14:15.982 --> 14:45.887
reverberation that the Submarines couldn't 
easily be distinguished from rocky bottoms, so at

14:46.778 --> 14:55.726
first there was a great effort bombing rock 
outcrops from the bottom. And so when that became

14:55.746 --> 15:04.874
known, then it was desirable to make bottom 
sediment charts of the Japan region and finally

14:55.746 --> 15:04.874
the whole Asian region. So that's what we were 
doing. Now, what had happened was that Shepard had

15:07.757 --> 15:14.963
started that and then had to make a trip to Hawaii 
for another acoustic problem. And so he sent a

15:15.533 --> 15:21.922
telegram to me to Illinois saying, come with or 
without permission. So I did the best I could for

15:22.703 --> 15:28.911
that anyway and came out right away then. And then 
worked in the field of marine geology for the Navy.

15:35.720 --> 15:39.505
And I take it that's between 43 and 45? That's 
right. It ended with the end of the war. It should.

15:48.282 --> 15:52.007
And then in 45, what did you do? Well, I knew that I 
wanted to stay in the field of marine geology,

15:52.027 --> 15:58.915
oceanography, so I went to University of Southern 
California. And on the visit there, I was given an

15:59.095 --> 16:09.148
offer for joining the department as an assistant

16:10.310 --> 16:13.434
I was just trying to think of the salary there. I 
think it was $2,800 a year or something

16:14.155 --> 16:23.828
like that. The first job, the one at the Illinois 
Geological Survey, was $2,100, and I thought that

16:25.550 --> 16:38.747
was quite a bit compared to the $300 or $400 that I'd 
been earning as a graduate student. Well, is it at

16:39.520 --> 16:42.988
the University of Southern California now? Let me 
phrase it this way. What's the next direction that

16:46.776 --> 16:49.742
your career takes in terms of research? Well, soon 
after I started teaching at the University of

16:50.584 --> 16:57.900
Southern California, actually about three 
months after I got there, I had a phone call from a

16:58.336 --> 17:13.577
geological survey saying that they were given the 
responsibility of finding out something about

16:58.336 --> 17:13.577
the radioactivity and the size of the hole that was 
going to be made at Bikini in the bomb tests of 1948.

17:14.975 --> 17:33.102
And

17:14.975 --> 17:33.102
so the information, the telegram, was capped in 
such a way that it seemed worthwhile to the

17:14.975 --> 17:33.102
University of Southern California to allow me to 
go, so they gave me a leave absence for that. It was

17:33.282 --> 17:38.029
about six months.

17:39.899 --> 17:45.386
the head of the department, Thomas Clements, took 
over my teaching as well as his own. And then I went

17:45.667 --> 17:47.009
on that. And that, of course, was a good time in 
marine geology and oceanography altogether,

17:47.950 --> 17:56.722
because for the first time, the oceanographers 
had enough ships. There were a lot of ships at

17:57.723 --> 17:58.945
Bikini. They weren't operating very well, 
mostly, for part of the time. In fact, I had two

18:03.389 --> 18:17.171
minesweepers to take samples and soundings in the 
lagoons of Bikini and Inuitok, Ronzalap and

18:03.389 --> 18:17.171
Rongarik, four atolls there, two were controls, 
Ronzalap, Rongarik. Bikini was the bomb test

18:18.252 --> 18:25.804
area, and Inuitok was downwind, and that made it a 
safety problem. So with the number of ships that

18:29.832 --> 18:39.407
were available, then oceanographers in all 
fields were able to do a lot of work in the Marshall

18:29.832 --> 18:39.407
Islands more intensely than they'd ever been able 
to do anyplace before. So this was a turning point

18:39.988 --> 18:43.273
for many people in oceanography. It was for me, I'd 
say. So I was quite happy continuing then in the

18:45.357 --> 18:52.568
oceanography, using teaching as a mechanism. 
Next, there was a call from the Navy. from the

18:57.608 --> 19:00.494
Geological Survey also for the Persian Gulf. The 
Navy had wanted to set up a hydrographic office.

19:04.201 --> 19:09.391
Hydrography before had been the matter of writing 
soundings on charts. They didn't really have any

19:10.533 --> 19:17.507
oceanography, so they'd made noise about wanting 
to do oceanography, so the Navy gave them the job.

19:17.740 --> 19:21.465
of doing oceanography in the Persian Gulf, and 
they weren't ready. So they asked me to take charge

19:21.485 --> 19:23.368
of it. I brought two students with me, one of whom, 
Robert Dill, is still in the business. He's

19:28.074 --> 19:31.820
director of Virgin Islands Laboratory. And so we 
made a rather thorough study in the short time

19:31.840 --> 19:37.447
available. It was only two weeks of ship time in 
August of 1948. So that, of course, was it. a

19:46.107 --> 19:57.505
different kind of marine geology, but one like 
Bikini that could make ties between biological

19:46.107 --> 19:57.505
oceanography and physical oceanography with the 
marine geology. And then, did you go out to the

19:58.586 --> 20:00.409
Persian Gulf? Yeah, during the summer times it 
didn't interfere with the teaching. And what new

20:06.299 --> 20:13.009
interest in oceanography in terms of, what 
direction is your career taking? Well, it was

20:14.204 --> 20:34.184
clear from Bikini and the Persian Gulf that there 
was a lot of interest in sedimentation, because

20:14.204 --> 20:34.184
geologists really hadn't—marine geologists 
really hadn't done very much in marine sediments

20:14.204 --> 20:34.184
after the Challenger expedition. In fact, as far 
as I know, I was the first one to make any systematic

20:34.204 --> 20:43.333
measurements of water content along the length of 
cores, as simple as that, for example. And then

20:44.225 --> 21:05.891
the close connection with the biology means that 
the

20:44.225 --> 21:05.891
organisms, both plants and animals that have 
calcareous skeletons, were directly associated

20:44.225 --> 21:05.891
with the sediments that they produced in both 
Bikini and the Persian Gulf. At the same time, of

21:06.893 --> 21:09.436
course, I was interested in those. I continued 
some work off Southern California, which was

21:09.456 --> 21:13.000
really a continuation of the kind of work that I've 
done as a doctor's dissertation with Shepard,

21:13.486 --> 21:21.359
working with basin sediments. And there, the 
organic matter was the main connection with the

21:22.220 --> 21:35.281
marine

21:22.220 --> 21:35.281
geology sediments. And what did your work with 
sediments demonstrate?

21:42.393 --> 22:00.676
from the viewpoint of modern sedimentologists, 
it demonstrated that there isn't much point in

21:42.393 --> 22:00.676
making general grain size measurements where 
grain size is a function of contribution by

21:42.393 --> 22:00.676
biological materials and not a function of 
distance or transportation. But more important

22:00.696 --> 22:05.802
than that, I got interested in the 
biogeochemistry, where we could trace the depth

22:05.984 --> 22:11.289
decrease of organic matter in the sediments. And 
that, of course, meant that we had to know

22:11.369 --> 22:18.276
something about the distribution of carbon and 
nitrogen in the sediments. It became clear that

22:18.857 --> 22:24.702
only part of the nitrogen was present as organic 
matter. So we tried various things. At the

22:27.986 --> 22:34.472
University of Southern California, there was a 
man named Rittenberg, Sidney Rittenberg, who had

22:27.986 --> 22:34.472
been at... at Scripps as a bacteriologist, and I 
had several projects, one of which funded a

22:34.672 --> 22:43.084
chemist getting his doctorate degree there. So 
that meant that we could make close ties between

22:43.144 --> 22:48.352
geology, biology, and bacteriology. That meant 
that we could take a stratigraphic approach to the

22:48.913 --> 22:58.707
distribution of organic matter and see what 
happened over the space of time as the sediments

22:48.913 --> 22:58.707
accumulated at a very slow rate. We found, for 
example, we did, among other things, the depth

22:58.727 --> 23:04.155
distribution of amino acids This showed that only 
about a fifth of the total nitrogen was in amino

23:04.388 --> 23:12.739
acids, so where is the rest? We also then worked on 
amino sugars and on ordinary sugars and

23:13.981 --> 23:33.687
carbohydrates and depth distribution of 
petroleum compounds or compounds that are

23:13.981 --> 23:33.687
closely related to petroleum, ones who are 
classified as naphthenes and aromatics and so

23:13.981 --> 23:33.687
forth. and worked on gases in the sediments, their 
origins and so forth. But in the techniques, I

23:40.803 --> 23:50.334
think we worked at that time pretty well, pretty 
thoroughly with the techniques that were

23:40.803 --> 23:50.334
available, techniques up to about 1960. And in 
1960, I put together a book called The Sea Off

23:51.916 --> 24:00.867
Southern California to summarize what had been 
done there in the sediments. And I had in mind

24:05.695 --> 24:15.857
making a change because I thought we were at the 
point of diminishing returns for the techniques

24:05.695 --> 24:15.857
then available for application to the marine 
sediments. And after writing the book, I went to

24:16.613 --> 24:22.320
work on the Dead Sea just to learn how salt was 
deposited. That also was to enable me to keep my

24:22.820 --> 24:29.649
sticky fingers off the manuscript for all the 
books being printed. And then when I came back, I

24:30.309 --> 24:39.280
stayed another year and decided to change oceans 
and fields and came to Woods Hole. changed oceans,

24:40.137 --> 24:45.085
and then changed entirely from sediments, almost 
entirely from sediments to geophysics. Okay, and

24:45.646 --> 24:50.013
your geophysics work. What were the first things 
you began to experiment with in geophysics? Well,

24:53.719 --> 25:05.098
what happened at that time was that the, after I'd 
taken the job at Woods Hole, the geological survey

24:53.719 --> 25:05.098
asked me to start a program for them on the on marine 
geology. I talked a lot before with the geological

25:07.874 --> 25:23.573
survey in previous years, previous directors, 
but they were always afraid of the high cost simply

25:07.874 --> 25:23.573
because one day of ship time would pay for maybe the 
whole summer for one geologist out in the field,

25:07.874 --> 25:23.573
field expenses. So they're slow at coming in.

25:28.459 --> 25:32.945
I told them that I'd accepted the job at Woods Hole 
and couldn't do that. Suggested that they pay for

25:33.626 --> 25:35.608
the They provide the funds for me to do the work I 
wanted to do on the coast and send six of their

25:36.483 --> 25:45.418
people then to be trained in marine geology and 
later to make their own way. So this then resulted

25:46.139 --> 26:00.883
in year-to-year work for about six or seven years 
for the study of the Atlantic continental shelf

25:46.139 --> 26:00.883
and slope, mainly the shelf. And at the end of six or 
seven years, The people then had learned how to do

26:03.820 --> 26:20.446
the work and wanted to make their own image, and now 
they have a separate organization, which is

26:03.820 --> 26:20.446
pretty large, about 90 people, I think, because 
the direction of the federal funds is going for

26:03.820 --> 26:20.446
energy.

26:21.688 --> 26:28.579
When we came to the coast, the major thing to do was 
to learn something about the sediments on the

26:21.688 --> 26:28.579
surface. the rocks of the shelf, the structure of 
the rocks at depth, and then other things like the

26:29.369 --> 26:43.907
relationships of the biology to the sediments and 
the effect of the shelf and slope on the currents.

26:43.947 --> 26:53.098
So this was a probe, multiple-faceted probe, into 
general oceanography.

26:53.399 --> 27:18.850
most obvious way to learn about the rocks at depth 
was to do seismic reflection continuous seismic

26:53.399 --> 27:18.850
reflection profiling the woods hold had a lot of 
experience in that before so had lamont head

26:53.399 --> 27:18.850
experience the but they were busy with other 
things so this method we could take a fundamental

26:53.399 --> 27:18.850
look at the problem of seismic work and start a new a 
new approach, not necessarily following the ways

27:19.235 --> 27:25.583
that had been done traditionally. So the first 
thing we did then was to look into the problems of

27:25.603 --> 27:34.113
seismic reflection, where basically there are 
several. One is the source, sound source. Another

27:37.378 --> 27:46.609
is the sound detection, reflection, to detect the 
echoes reflected back from the inner layers

27:37.378 --> 27:46.609
within the bottom. Neither is the processing of 
that sound. Neither is the recording of it. We

27:51.848 --> 27:56.430
started with the recording, I guess, because...
