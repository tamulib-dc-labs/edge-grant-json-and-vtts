WEBVTT

00:01.904 --> 00:06.671
Question about the other benefits besides pay. I 
mean, you said just a minute ago that you weren't

00:06.751 --> 00:14.463
interested in pay when you were... Well, that 
wasn't your main objective. I don't think that up

00:14.503 --> 00:25.740
until 1963 you're really interested in what the 
job was to be done. And I had so many fantastic jobs

00:29.090 --> 00:35.259
by, I was just enthusiastic about the Air Force. 
And getting back to Massawa, after I shipped all

00:35.580 --> 00:45.956
these people home, the re-enlistment rate at 
Massawa jumped to about three percent. I mean,

00:45.996 --> 00:47.338
three times. Really? Oh yeah, because

00:52.563 --> 00:57.416
Even though you were kind of a hard nose, did it 
sound like? Oh, yeah. Because they figured they

00:58.920 --> 01:01.085
had a mission. And they were interested. And of 
course, we're getting off of pay, but... Another

01:09.134 --> 01:19.628
thing we set up was an educational program at the 
University of Maryland I think came in and set up

01:09.134 --> 01:19.628
schools there. And you encourage all these young 
men instead of going down to the beer garden why

01:19.848 --> 01:25.896
they go to school at night. And they could get the 
first two years of college out of the way by going to

01:26.116 --> 01:36.930
night school at Masato. and you could raise their 
work schedule so that they could always attend

01:37.568 --> 01:42.876
school. So you're greatly involved in doing a good 
job and knowing you're doing a good job and so

01:44.819 --> 02:00.444
you're really not interested in and you were 
getting pretty well paid. See when I got promoted

02:00.464 --> 02:04.150
to full colonel By 1942 you had nine years service 
and you were full colonel until 57. Your pay was

02:13.332 --> 02:17.777
pretty good all during those years anyway.

02:19.379 --> 02:33.175
The only thing I say is today where there is more 
emphasis on pay and benefits that there were a lot

02:33.762 --> 02:36.666
more people talking about it. And therefore, more 
people are setting the standard that you have to

02:36.686 --> 02:51.206
pay the military more than they're now being paid.

02:54.070 --> 03:00.158
And well, when the Department of Labor, I think 
it's the Department of Labor, establishes that

03:00.610 --> 03:17.911
you have to make $9,600 to be above the poverty 
level, and you have a third of your military making

03:00.610 --> 03:17.911
less than that, why then everybody in the military 
thinks they're in the poverty level.

03:21.415 --> 03:25.200
But that doesn't of course take into account the 
other benefits Well, you have... You do have a

03:25.754 --> 03:33.542
considerable amount of benefits in the armed 
forces where you don't get those in business.

03:33.942 --> 03:35.864
Often you don't have those in business. Well... 
Let's go back to this one again. What I'd like to do

03:43.431 --> 03:52.420
is, when did you start thinking about this 
differential in pay and when did you start

03:43.431 --> 03:52.420
thinking that it was becoming a problem? have not 
been able to keep your best young commanders in.

03:57.450 --> 04:00.294
Well, it wasn't a problem while I was in the 
service. In fact, it wasn't a problem that you

04:00.354 --> 04:14.211
really get to looking at it until you get into the 
building business and you get to realize how much

04:00.354 --> 04:14.211
some people are making. I see, yeah, right, yeah. 
See, you really haven't... you really don't know.

04:19.711 --> 04:27.762
You look at somebody and you don't know if he's 
making $60,000 or $80,000 or whether or not he's

04:19.711 --> 04:27.762
making $18,000.

04:29.244 --> 04:30.005
You don't know that. When you get into a position 
where you get to know how much various people are

04:31.747 --> 04:47.027
making in the various occupations, why you just 
get to the point that that

04:47.902 --> 05:00.139
the commanders and managers in the military are 
just way underpaid.

05:00.389 --> 05:19.771
realize this during the 1950s when the Air Force 
was expanding did you know people who were

05:00.389 --> 05:19.771
colonels and generals who were getting out of the 
service instead of staying in 30 years they were

05:00.389 --> 05:19.771
getting out early they were getting out after 20 
years because they could get a better paying job?

05:19.791 --> 05:30.042
No

05:19.791 --> 05:30.042
I don't really remember of any particular 
instance where individuals were getting out.

05:32.326 --> 05:41.396
Sometimes a general officer would get an offer of a 
good civilian job and he would retire

05:32.326 --> 05:41.396
twenty-seven year service or something of this 
sort. But see the twenty year retirement, I don't

05:41.436 --> 05:58.273
remember when it exactly came in, but it hasn't 
been in very much before I retired.

06:00.768 --> 06:10.761
But I would say that you're...

06:00.768 --> 06:10.761
See, when I went and got in the Air Force, you had all 
kinds of jobs. And now, you get into specifics

06:11.281 --> 06:20.053
where you have an individual who does nothing but 
fly. Now, maybe he flies every third day. And he has

06:22.676 --> 06:29.745
two days, maybe one day, that he has to brush up on 
his missions. And he has another day of doing

06:30.333 --> 06:33.256
nothing. I mean, this is whereas we don't use this 
talent in part-time jobs.

06:46.470 --> 06:47.831
What do you mean by that? I don't think I 
understand. Well, OK. My son-in-law was a

06:49.874 --> 06:55.379
navigator. And he was stationed in Hawaii when we 
were there. And that's where he met my wife. oldest

07:00.370 --> 07:03.673
daughter, and he was a navigator. And he maybe flew 
a mission once every two days, or three days, I mean

07:03.693 --> 07:10.139
every three or four days. While he was on the 
ground, he didn't have anything to do because he

07:10.900 --> 07:19.388
was on call for a mission. Well, he could spend so 
much time taking University of Maryland courses,

07:20.490 --> 07:30.259
college courses, But what do you do the rest of the 
time? And we don't spend enough time of developing

07:34.025 --> 07:58.204
part-time jobs so that he could be a supply officer 
or something else that would be productive for him

07:34.025 --> 07:58.204
during his off time, during his eight hour a day 
work day. OK, that brings me to another question.

08:01.390 --> 08:07.256
You said that when you were the commander of the 
39th Air Division, here you are up in northern

08:01.390 --> 08:07.256
Japan. And you're snowed in pretty much of the 
winter. And it's probably fairly cold and

08:11.961 --> 08:14.543
miserable up there. You had things set up for the 
men and officers, such as the University of

08:15.705 --> 08:22.091
Maryland night courses. What other type of 
entertainment or after duty programs did you have

08:28.542 --> 08:34.433
or did you try to develop any of these programs so 
these people would have something to do? Well, you

08:34.473 --> 08:39.402
develop

08:34.473 --> 08:39.402
bowling alleys. Did you build some bowling 
alleys? Well, we may have had them there. We had

08:45.513 --> 08:49.099
quite an extensive

08:50.294 --> 08:53.278
special service programs, a bowling alley. Then 
you had your basketball, both your high school

08:53.358 --> 09:08.238
basketball and your base basketball teams, and 
that you had visiting teams come in or visiting

08:53.358 --> 09:08.238
high school teams come in. And you had an extensive 
youth program of teaching the high school kids of

09:19.910 --> 09:25.777
how to shoot a rifle, for example. And we gave them 
dancing lessons and ceramic lessons. And my

09:34.646 --> 09:46.500
oldest daughter took painting lessons from a 
professional Japanese painter in oils. And so you

09:46.520 --> 09:49.663
set up a lot of... swimming,

09:50.065 --> 09:56.852
indoor swimming pool, and you teach everybody how 
to swim.

10:00.115 --> 10:07.342
So you had a really extensive youth program to keep 
out of trouble. But to get everybody involved in

10:07.382 --> 10:14.449
some kind of activity is most difficult. Because 
some of them just don't want to do anything. Any

10:18.736 --> 10:22.440
directed activity. They want to do what they want 
to do. And then you of course have an extensive

10:25.523 --> 10:32.631
library so that people who are readers can read. 
What about liberty? What kind of liberty sections

10:36.135 --> 10:39.739
did you have? What do you mean liberty? they worked 
basically in Japan they worked eight to four or

10:43.492 --> 10:56.430
eight to five days something like that and then how 
often would they have the duty to stay on all night

10:43.492 --> 10:56.430
on the base all night? Oh not very much. Normally 
you left that up to your squaring commanders where

10:57.592 --> 11:10.950
you like Christmas by you had required to keep say 
fifty percent of your of his squadron on base and

11:11.369 --> 11:18.957
then you just depend on him to

11:11.369 --> 11:18.957
manage it. You really didn't, then you had alert 
aircraft and that was on a roster basis.

11:28.267 --> 11:30.869
So the officers and men then got plenty of time off? 
Yeah, they'd get plenty of time off. Not in Japan,

11:34.593 --> 11:40.279
up in Misawa, unless you go down to Tokyo. You 
didn't have a lot of off-base activities.

11:49.120 --> 11:52.803
Okay, now let's go to your next duty assignment. 
You said you got your next duty assignment because

11:52.823 --> 12:00.591
you did a good job up in Missawa. Basically, what 
did you do as the Deputy for Plans and Operations of

12:00.611 --> 12:05.435
Pacific Air Force Hawaii? Well, that... involved 
just about what I wrote out there. Advising the

12:12.723 --> 12:14.084
commander. Well, see the fifth of the PACAF 
headquarters was organized where you had a

12:14.565 --> 12:28.841
commander and you had a vice commander and then you 
had two deputies. And then the entire staff were

12:28.902 --> 12:37.131
under those two deputies so that in your chain of 
command You had operations, flying safety,

12:38.005 --> 12:46.859
anything that had to do with the flying program, 
and anything to do with the plans program. Those

12:48.361 --> 12:53.469
were under your direction. And then you had 
underneath you, then you had a director of plans

12:53.830 --> 13:03.405
and you had a director of operations. And then you 
dealt through them as far as the staff is

13:03.588 --> 13:10.514
concerned. Who was it? How about cutting that off 
now? So basically, then, we have four generals who

13:15.019 --> 13:21.485
are running the Fifth Air Force. Well, you're also 
your- Is that the chain of command? Well, also you

13:26.249 --> 13:30.253
had-

13:32.950 --> 13:37.995
My deputy for operations was also a brigadier 
general. Oh, I see. So you were a senior brigadier,

13:38.535 --> 13:43.060
and he was a junior. Yeah. And then your director of 
plans was also a, if the slot was a brigadier

13:44.862 --> 13:50.827
general. At the time, he wasn't a brigadier. He was 
a colonel. But normally, he was occupying a BG

13:53.250 --> 13:58.335
slot. And see, I was occupying a major general 
slot. Then the commander was a four star and the

14:02.583 --> 14:07.089
vice commander was a three star. And then you had 
two two stars. And then under this other side,

14:10.934 --> 14:29.097
under logistics, while you had the

14:10.934 --> 14:29.097
surgeon was a brigadier general, he had a number of 
brigadier generals underneath him.

14:31.878 --> 14:35.982
Who was, at this time, who was your general? Well, 
General O'Donnell, Rosie O'Donnell, was the

14:36.002 --> 14:40.687
commander. He was a four star? He was a four star. 
And then you had General Moorman, who was a

14:44.811 --> 14:52.098
classmate of mine from West Point, was a three 
star. And then I was underneath any of them. Why

15:00.481 --> 15:02.663
weren't you promoted to a two-star then? Well, see 
this was getting down to the point, and this is

15:03.224 --> 15:22.085
rationalizing I would say, that

15:03.224 --> 15:22.085
you were getting down to the point where you had 
twenty-eight year service. At that time I had

15:22.225 --> 15:26.910
twenty-eight year service. And the Air Force 
promotes their individuals rather early. And

15:34.179 --> 15:56.982
according to just rumors that I'd been told by 
another classmate that at that stage the Air Force

15:34.179 --> 15:56.982
just wasn't promoting anybody to a

15:34.179 --> 15:56.982
higher grade. because that would, you'd just get 
more retired pay and things of this sort. Anyway,

16:04.303 --> 16:18.523
why,

16:04.303 --> 16:18.523
I didn't really think about retiring at all, 
because when I was brought into PACF

16:04.303 --> 16:18.523
headquarters, why, General O'Donnell was 
positive that he could get me promoted. That's

16:19.244 --> 16:21.127
what he told you? Yeah, and

16:21.147 --> 16:25.753
so that, I didn't prepare for retirement. As far as 
I was concerned, as long as I was on active duty, I

16:33.500 --> 16:54.700
didn't prepare myself at all for any retirement 
job and for retirement life because I was too busy

16:33.500 --> 16:54.700
doing a military job.

16:54.720 --> 16:56.702
And these are both of the The director of the deputy 
for operations and plans is an extremely

16:57.273 --> 17:03.723
responsible guy. It's a staff job, as you 
understand it. You prepare operational orders

17:08.270 --> 17:13.117
and send them out for execution, the 5th Air Force. 
And the 5th Air Force in turn sends it down to the air

17:13.217 --> 17:16.743
divisions. And you prepare all kinds of plans for 
various types of emergencies. and you go out and

17:26.737 --> 17:33.405
inspect probably twice a year. All the different 
bases? All the different bases. And how can you

17:38.531 --> 17:53.588
differentiate between your job as the deputy for 
plans and operations and then your next job in 1962

17:38.531 --> 17:53.588
and 63 as the deputy for administration and 
logistics?

17:53.939 --> 17:59.449
In other words, you were switching from one of the 
deputies to another deputy. Well, the reason for

17:59.469 --> 18:07.944
that is the operations and plans job is probably 
the most important one. In view of the fact that I

18:08.204 --> 18:17.280
wasn't going to get promoted by General O'Donnell 
had made available to him a a major general that he

18:17.767 --> 18:20.910
particularly wanted. So I had the choice of either 
I could retire at that time

18:20.930 --> 18:39.971
or I could move over and take this other plans and 
logistics job for the remaining one year I had

18:20.930 --> 18:39.971
before retiring. When you learned that you 
weren't going to be promoted, what were your

18:41.413 --> 18:45.057
feelings? Well, your ego gets pretty well 
tarnished.

18:58.545 --> 19:04.972
I didn't go into the darks of depression or 
anything. I enjoyed my job over in administration

19:06.394 --> 19:10.878
logistics. It was a real high-powered job. more 
the business side of running a Far East PACAF

19:15.513 --> 19:28.488
headquarters, Pacific Air Forces, than the plans 
and operations. Because all of your

19:29.409 --> 19:44.946
justification before the air staff in Washington 
on how much money you needed to run the PACAF

19:29.409 --> 19:44.946
command, had to be justified. You had to prepare 
all kinds of documents that way. The

19:50.232 --> 20:00.046
personnel that you got followed through your 
director of personnel. So it's really, on that

20:01.869 --> 20:12.705
side, it's more of the business side of running a 
big corporation than the plans and operations.

20:15.976 --> 20:19.180
That would prepare you then for civilian duties. 
Yeah, you would think so. And did you think about

20:21.042 --> 20:22.083
that? No, you really don't. As far as I was 
concerned, I really didn't think about retiring

20:24.566 --> 20:33.576
until about three months before retiring and 
decide what you're going to do. And you really have

20:33.896 --> 20:37.881
no, you don't know what you're going to do. I mean, 
you never thought about it, what you're going to

20:38.241 --> 20:40.784
do. And you have a lot of major problems in 
retiring. at age 55 with I

20:46.199 --> 20:55.152
guess your ego that you're pretty good. And so you 
say, well what am I going to do? You have a job here of

21:00.060 --> 21:15.042
dividing up say $200 million in 1963 among various 
bases and activities and what have you. And you

21:16.743 --> 21:18.345
have all kinds of funds. You have 750 staff 
personnel. And you're taking care of about

21:22.731 --> 21:30.822
100,000 people at 20 air bases. So that's a big job. 
And then you retire. And

21:38.472 --> 21:46.362
you say, well, boy, I should be able to run General 
Dynamics.

21:47.236 --> 21:54.364
And so you start looking for a job, and that's a 
completely different story, I'm sure. We're

21:54.384 --> 21:57.728
going to talk about your retirement in a bit.

22:01.052 --> 22:07.279
It's rather interesting to me that here you are at a 
top staff position, 1963.

22:09.942 --> 22:12.445
Vietnam is just starting to wind up. Kennedy is 
ascending. 15,000 advisors into Vietnam in 1963.

22:22.885 --> 22:24.907
We hadn't started the bombing yet. That didn't 
come until 1965. But the Air Force, and especially

22:28.451 --> 22:32.636
the Fifth Air Force, must have. Were you at all 
involved with any of the early? Can you tell me

22:36.720 --> 22:40.925
about that, your experience, your involvement in 
Vietnam? No, I was in Vietnam and had gone all over

22:41.325 --> 22:46.251
Vietnam. Well, I don't know whether 
it's—somewhere in between 61 and 63. I mean it was

22:51.983 --> 22:57.013
while I was in one of those jobs. And of course we had 
some

22:57.033 --> 23:06.670
activity.

23:08.725 --> 23:26.288
establishing training programs for the 
Vietnamese pilots and discussion of technical

23:08.725 --> 23:26.288
schools, whether or not you bring them back to the 
United States and train your mechanics and radio

23:08.725 --> 23:26.288
operators and all the other people. I would say the 
big decision that

23:36.788 --> 24:04.669
which was a controversy, is whether or not you 
teach, you write the training manuals in

23:36.788 --> 24:04.669
Vietnamese and let them learn in their native 
language or whether or not you bring all these

23:36.788 --> 24:04.669
people back to the States and teach them English 
first and then let them learn from the books

23:36.788 --> 24:04.669
written in English.

24:06.185 --> 24:10.712
in the headquarters there why there were two 
proposals. One of them is, as far as I was

24:10.892 --> 24:19.486
concerned, we should establish a technical 
school in Vietnam and write the books in

24:10.892 --> 24:19.486
Vietnamese. That was your opinion? That was my 
opinion. It

24:22.350 --> 24:30.623
seemed to me it would have been a lot easier to do it 
that way and not have these people coming back,

24:30.907 --> 24:39.455
flowing back to the states in vast numbers and 
taking so much longer time to be trained. But the

24:39.936 --> 24:55.911
way that the Air Force was doing it worldwide was 
bringing the indigenous personnel back to the

24:39.936 --> 24:55.911
states, teach them English, and then let them go 
through our technical schools. That's the way it

24:55.951 --> 24:57.673
was going to run. And did you put in a proposal to set 
up a technical school? That was in the

25:04.093 --> 25:08.519
headquarters, and I don't think it ever got beyond 
the headquarters. That would have been, just an

25:08.539 --> 25:12.385
aside here, that would have been an excellent job 
for you. Well, I had a good job. No, seriously

25:16.871 --> 25:23.120
though, because you had had so much experience in 
setting up schools. Did you ever think of that? No,

25:25.925 --> 25:27.627
I never did. Well, the thing about it, by that time, 
and not getting promoted, I knew I was going to

25:29.210 --> 25:35.979
retire. So it just wasn't worth the while to get 
involved in a technical training school or

25:36.700 --> 25:50.458
command or what have you at that time. Do you 
remember any high-level discussions besides

25:51.586 --> 25:54.969
this issue? Do you remember any other high-level 
discussions about Vietnam at Fifth Air Force

25:55.249 --> 26:00.294
Headquarters? You mean at PACAF Headquarters? 
Yeah. Well, I attended most of the meetings

26:04.277 --> 26:19.451
that—let's see, you have Pacific Air Forces and 
you have Pacific PACOM, which is Pacific Command.

26:19.531 --> 26:20.732
Now that was at the time— was run by a Navy

26:21.404 --> 26:26.912
four-star admiral. And of course that was an 
integrated command, had Army, Air Force,

26:28.574 --> 26:36.945
Marines, Navy running it. And the generals in 
Vietnam reported to him. The generals in Vietnam

26:40.791 --> 26:43.034
reported to him. So did you sit in at some of those 
meetings? Oh yeah, well I was... I was involved in

26:51.610 --> 27:11.129
most of the plans in Vietnam, and of course I think 
it's known that we the politicians just

26:51.610 --> 27:11.129
controlled Vietnam War to the extent that it was a 
no-win situation. And was that the basic feeling?

27:14.232 --> 27:16.454
Now think back 1961 through 1963. I know that I'm 
sure that you feel that way today, but is that what

27:16.574 --> 27:20.858
you felt back then? That the politicians were 
controlling you too much? Well you had two

27:23.630 --> 27:27.094
situations. One of them is you had the Army trying 
to control the

27:27.234 --> 27:39.406
jungle warfare. They wanted their primary 
mission to be jungle warfare. And of course you had

27:43.310 --> 27:50.878
the Air Force

27:43.310 --> 27:50.878
having most of the airplanes and the pilots. and 
you had the Army still trying to get back their

27:51.415 --> 28:00.146
close support airplanes.

28:02.670 --> 28:06.835
They figured that they could do a better job than 
the Air Force was doing. So they had some inner

28:09.138 --> 28:11.361
service right there. Yeah, but most of your 
proposals were expansion, and of course it did

28:11.381 --> 28:20.072
expand, but it still didn't expand as much as the 
Air Force would have liked to at the time because

28:20.913 --> 28:37.576
if you go over and visit Vietnam it was so 
primitive. I mean you go back in the backwoods and

28:37.596 --> 28:44.506
the natives were still throwing spears. I mean 
they were armed with spears.

28:50.950 --> 28:53.674
and bows and arrows type of thing. And these 
mountaineers, I mean they were tough cookies, but

28:55.196 --> 29:14.463
they just didn't have the armament,

28:55.196 --> 29:14.463
the guns and what have you, and probably were 
pretty close to untrainable. The guns that we

29:14.483 --> 29:18.088
provided them, whatever the MPO rifle or whatever 
the type of rifle that we provided them, the stock

29:18.541 --> 29:27.270
was just too long for them to get it up under, get it 
up to the shoulder. I mean they were small people.

29:28.952 --> 29:35.479
And so they had to hold it like I did when I was 12 
years old. Dad's 12 gauge, 10 gauge shotgun. You

29:39.383 --> 29:43.587
hold it under your underarm and you try to shoot it. 
And they were very, very primitive people. You

29:48.826 --> 29:59.022
just can't imagine how primitive a major part of 
the Vietnamese people were. If we couldn't lick

30:00.144 --> 30:12.763
them with

30:00.144 --> 30:12.763
all our modern tanks and what have you, we'd better 
quit.

30:14.313 --> 30:21.882
just build it up so gradually that you really go in 
in a no-win situation. And I think we, at the time,

30:22.162 --> 30:28.349
we were voicing the same opinion. And I think the 
military, during that period of time, were trying

30:28.429 --> 30:39.021
to expand the war to win the war. Now, 
specifically, why were you sent to Vietnam? What

30:42.485 --> 30:43.206
was your mission? Well, I went over there on a staff 
visit

30:43.878 --> 31:08.427
to visit all of the air bases that were in existence 
for use by

30:43.878 --> 31:08.427
our own Air Force and also the Vietnamese Air 
Force. How many air bases did we have in 1962? We

31:13.561 --> 31:22.689
had, I think we had two that were finished and we 
were building about two others or three others.

31:23.830 --> 31:34.920
And then of course I met General LeMay over there 
when he came over there for a visit and somewhere in

31:23.830 --> 31:34.920
my files I have a report that I read and wrote after 
his visit. He came, he flew in, he was chief of staff

31:34.960 --> 31:43.568
at the airports at the time and he came in to look 
over

31:44.645 --> 31:46.217
And he flew around.
