WEBVTT

00:02.950 --> 00:19.177
in the Hagler Building, and I have the pleasure of interviewing Bob Walker, the incomparably tireless and capable Chief Development Officer for Texas A&M.

00:19.577 --> 00:20.519
Bob, check your mic.

00:21.120 --> 00:22.863
Okay.

00:22.883 --> 00:26.629
I'm serving as Vice President for Development for Texas A&M University.

00:28.465 --> 00:31.789
I believe I forgot to mention the date.

00:31.869 --> 00:34.452
This is April 12, year 2000.

00:35.473 --> 00:46.307
Bob, to begin, would you give a brief biographical sketch of your life and experience before you enrolled as a freshman at Texas A&M?

00:46.467 --> 00:48.509
Where and how long and so forth?

00:50.051 --> 00:56.599
Well, I was born, Haskell, in Victoria, Texas, January the 20th, 1936.

00:58.064 --> 01:01.368
We lived there for about a year.

01:01.488 --> 01:06.074
My father was working for Central Power and Light.

01:06.094 --> 01:08.697
He was then transferred to Westlaco, Texas.

01:09.398 --> 01:12.682
And I entered the first grade and completed the first grade in Westlaco.

01:14.124 --> 01:20.552
He then was transferred to the beautiful city of Presidio out in the Big Bend area.

01:22.014 --> 01:25.658
And we lived there and I finished the sixth grade.

01:26.768 --> 01:30.032
And during that period of time, I was always in the minority.

01:30.873 --> 01:33.056
I was one of three Anglos in my class.

01:34.338 --> 01:40.926
And I was good at rock throwing and riding horses and swimming and a few things like that.

01:40.986 --> 01:48.476
We then moved to Spur, Texas, south of Lubbock and Dickens County.

01:48.496 --> 01:55.965
My father was then working for the West Tex Utility Company because they had bought out the Central Power and Light Facility at Presidio.

01:57.802 --> 02:08.477
I finished high school there in 1954 and then came to Texas A&M in September of 1954.

02:09.778 --> 02:13.724
As you now look back on it, why did you decide to come to A&M?

02:15.546 --> 02:19.872
It's a strange story of how I even got to college in the first place.

02:21.274 --> 02:22.696
My father was an electrician.

02:23.357 --> 02:26.982
I grew up around things mechanical.

02:27.569 --> 02:32.634
have always scored in the highest percentile in mechanical ability.

02:33.074 --> 02:37.639
I like to fix things, repair things, analyze things.

02:37.659 --> 02:44.545
And my dad let me take a Smith Corona typewriter apart when I was about seven years old, put it back together.

02:45.426 --> 02:55.956
I tore down and repaired and rebuilt a Ford tractor, four-cylinder engine, when I was in about the fifth grade.

02:56.358 --> 03:05.748
My lifelong ambition in high school was to someday be a mechanic on my own mechanic shop and repair cars.

03:06.348 --> 03:07.389
I was in love with cars.

03:07.630 --> 03:15.678
My first car was a 1939 Ford, and I was so pleased that it would drive 28 miles from where I bought it to our house.

03:17.279 --> 03:25.588
But a very wonderful lady that was my civics teacher my senior year, Mrs. Ida Johnston,

03:26.902 --> 03:32.189
Just an incredibly good teacher and an inspiring person.

03:34.272 --> 03:47.049
And one day after we had finished a civics project and I had gotten the best grade she said she'd ever given, I was in front of the class explaining why I put all these things in various parts of the city on my chart.

03:48.311 --> 03:52.376
And she said, well, Bobby, let me ask you one other question.

03:52.396 --> 03:53.938
I was then known as Bobby Walker.

03:54.762 --> 03:57.506
She said, why don't you tell the class where you're going to college?

03:59.850 --> 04:05.900
And being a little quick on my feet, I said, well, Mrs. Johnston, I have not really made up my mind yet.

04:07.362 --> 04:12.711
And after class, I went up to her and I said, Mrs. Johnston, that was not a very fair question.

04:12.731 --> 04:14.413
That was kind of dirty, as a matter of fact.

04:14.574 --> 04:17.438
You know I'm not planning to go to college.

04:17.458 --> 04:19.842
And she said, I know that, and that'll be a big mistake.

04:20.952 --> 04:22.273
You need to go to college.

04:22.293 --> 04:27.699
She said, you could still be a mechanic, but you ought to go to college first.

04:27.719 --> 04:29.480
And I said, well, I wouldn't even know where to go.

04:29.520 --> 04:37.709
And she said, well, why don't you go to Texas A&M College with your good friend Don McGinty?

04:38.589 --> 04:45.276
And I said, well, it's probably too late, and I don't have an application, and I wouldn't even know where to begin.

04:45.416 --> 04:50.301
And she opened her desk drawer and pulled out an application and said, let's fill this out.

04:51.277 --> 04:54.501
And we did, and I ultimately came to Texas A&M.

04:55.722 --> 05:02.710
I was so naive at that time that I didn't even know you had to be in the Cadet Corps.

05:02.730 --> 05:04.312
I'd never been to College Station.

05:05.874 --> 05:18.769
I did get a little bit of an introduction by going to Junction, to the adjunct, and it was then touted as the stepping stone program for

05:19.120 --> 05:25.910
individuals that had gone to small rural high schools going to a major college.

05:26.571 --> 05:33.561
Now, you were, you did not go to Junction as a, what do we call it now?

05:34.082 --> 05:35.524
Oh, the Junction football boys?

05:35.564 --> 05:37.627
No, no, no, the students that are there.

05:38.328 --> 05:40.891
Oh, the geology students.

05:40.911 --> 05:41.552
Surveying.

05:42.033 --> 05:44.176
Are those that are admitted provisionally?

05:44.196 --> 05:44.917
No, no, no, no.

05:45.118 --> 05:47.541
I was fully admitted.

05:47.757 --> 05:50.421
Of course, in those days, you've got 16 credits.

05:50.762 --> 05:52.324
You'd get any school in Texas.

05:52.404 --> 05:53.786
And this was the summer of?

05:54.167 --> 05:54.748
1954.

05:57.351 --> 05:59.094
Well, describe the adjunction.

05:59.134 --> 06:03.380
We don't have much information about the, describe the adjunct and what it was like.

06:03.400 --> 06:09.349
Well, the adjunct was probably less than 200 of us there.

06:10.892 --> 06:14.297
And we had some outstanding professors.

06:14.838 --> 06:15.739
I remember

06:16.141 --> 06:19.746
Mr. Lyles, who taught algebra.

06:20.908 --> 06:24.173
I remember Sid Cox, who taught English.

06:26.476 --> 06:30.181
I remember a man in the basic division.

06:30.802 --> 06:35.890
Oh, I can't recall his name right now, but... Not Austin Curley.

06:35.950 --> 06:37.212
It was not Austin Curley.

06:37.252 --> 06:42.820
It was a little man that I just can't recall it now.

06:42.880 --> 06:43.701
I think...

06:44.322 --> 06:47.245
Cliff Randstill was in and out of there a little bit too.

06:48.507 --> 06:51.550
But what they did is they tested us to see if we could read.

06:52.231 --> 06:53.792
And I needed a reading course.

06:53.893 --> 06:57.977
So I took remedial reading, algebra, PE course, and English.

06:59.599 --> 07:04.324
And wound up with seven credits, some extra grade points.

07:05.926 --> 07:11.292
But we lived in little, almost like Quonset huts.

07:12.253 --> 07:14.295
They were a slab, concrete slab.

07:15.372 --> 07:21.338
had a metal roof on them, corrugated asbestos siding with windows that opened up with screens.

07:22.059 --> 07:24.602
12 bunks in there.

07:24.622 --> 07:31.730
And you had to have, call to quarter, CQ, at night studying, and the profs would come around.

07:32.671 --> 07:34.573
I'll never forget Sid Cox.

07:35.814 --> 07:38.617
He was kind of a burly, rough guy.

07:39.958 --> 07:45.244
And he walked into our little barracks there, and he was carrying a machete.

07:46.000 --> 07:53.168
And he turned it sideways and just slapped it on the desk and he said, young fellow, are you having any problems?

07:53.188 --> 07:54.790
And he just scared the life out of me.

07:55.650 --> 08:02.458
But he was a good teacher and I enjoyed the experience there very much.

08:04.620 --> 08:11.788
I also had the opportunity while there observing Coach Bear Bryant bringing the football team there.

08:12.460 --> 08:16.426
And so I watched practice practically every day for those two weeks they were there.

08:16.666 --> 08:19.310
What was your impression of what was going on for them?

08:20.292 --> 08:23.096
Well, my impression was that it was a very difficult time.

08:24.077 --> 08:32.290
He brought them there for focus, concentration, and to find out who wanted to play.

08:32.310 --> 08:40.662
They lined off a field out there that was filled with grass burrs and goat heads and put up a goal post, and it was hot.

08:41.806 --> 08:49.767
And I've read the Junction Boys book, and it's a little exaggerated in many areas.

08:50.810 --> 08:55.562
But it was true that there was a larger number came out there than left.

08:56.555 --> 08:58.818
And it was an interesting experience.

08:58.838 --> 09:00.199
He was a very demanding coach.

09:01.120 --> 09:08.108
All right, back for you and the rest of them at Junction as students.

09:08.769 --> 09:11.753
Describe a typical weekday.

09:11.973 --> 09:14.015
When did it begin and what happened when?

09:14.556 --> 09:19.141
Well, normally we got up about 6 or 6.30, had breakfast.

09:19.802 --> 09:24.267
It was a chow line type arrangement in a large dining hall, metal roof on it.

09:24.550 --> 09:27.554
They wanted you to eat early because it got pretty warm in the daytime.

09:28.816 --> 09:29.277
We ate.

09:30.659 --> 09:34.264
We had inspection of our barracks, had to have the beds made up, that kind of thing.

09:35.505 --> 09:40.392
And then we had our classes, and we had regular classrooms in almost like Quonset huts.

09:41.614 --> 09:50.126
And usually our classes were all in the morning, so we had the afternoons free and plenty of time to study in the evening.

09:51.387 --> 09:52.549
But it was...

09:53.558 --> 10:08.800
I felt like it was everything they said it was a stepping stone for those of us who did not have the academic challenges in small rural high schools that we needed to be successful at Texas A&M.

10:08.965 --> 10:13.210
If you and your buddies wanted to play, where did you all play?

10:13.751 --> 10:23.622
Well, you could go to the big city of Menard or Mason or Junction or any of those metropolises around there.

10:23.863 --> 10:29.589
There was not a whole lot to do and very few coeds anywhere around.

10:31.111 --> 10:33.754
What did, do you remember the cost of that summer?

10:35.236 --> 10:37.639
It was, I don't know.

10:38.159 --> 10:41.642
maybe $150 for the summer, six weeks period.

10:42.723 --> 10:44.585
Now you had not yet been to College Station?

10:44.605 --> 10:46.167
No, I'd never been to College Station.

10:47.308 --> 10:55.455
Describe then your coming to College Station to enroll and your impression with the campus when you first saw it.

10:55.475 --> 11:05.905
Well, Don McGinty, my roommate, was coming five days early before classes began and so

11:06.610 --> 11:16.026
We decided we'd come together and my father drove us here and then we unloaded our foot lockers and our clothes and they assigned us to a dorm.

11:17.568 --> 11:24.360
And the only people I knew were those football players.

11:24.380 --> 11:26.824
And so I went over to football practice again.

11:27.445 --> 11:31.892
Bryant, Coach Bryant had his players back and I knew

11:32.615 --> 11:38.383
I knew a number of those players, and so we went over and watched them practice even again.

11:39.664 --> 11:52.782
But I remember my hometown then was probably less than 3,000 people, and coming to a place that was going to have around 7,500 students, it seemed like big.

11:53.523 --> 12:00.512
The dormitories looked huge, and I was assigned to dorm one and was going to be in the

12:01.252 --> 12:03.415
Air Force, Squadron 4.

12:04.637 --> 12:07.501
So they gave us our room, and that's where we started.

12:07.521 --> 12:17.996
Describe your first introduction to Aggie traditions of conduct and fish life and so forth.

12:18.256 --> 12:22.762
Well, of course, the haircuts were one of the first things that we encountered.

12:22.842 --> 12:30.313
Although I wore my hair relatively short, it was obvious that we were going to get it buzzed off.

12:31.306 --> 12:33.329
and a flat top was too long.

12:33.969 --> 12:41.679
So I remember they said, if anything shows over your fingers when you ran your hand up in your hair, it had to go.

12:43.341 --> 12:49.770
And I'll never forget them assigning our, you know, issuing us our uniforms.

12:51.812 --> 13:01.144
I had never worn khaki uniforms and I didn't know much about creases and starch and then those military shoes.

13:01.934 --> 13:07.439
big-time blisters because they were pretty big, hard-soled shoes.

13:09.881 --> 13:25.494
The other thing I remember more than anything else was that there was just a lot of unknown factors to a kid from a little high school that had 32 in our graduating class.

13:25.514 --> 13:31.519
But that five-day period that I was here, I just explored the campus everywhere.

13:32.174 --> 13:34.677
and had a wonderful time doing it.

13:36.599 --> 13:45.330
So the serendipity of it all was I did benefit greatly by coming that week early.

13:46.491 --> 13:55.482
And there were some of my friends that were very dismayed because we didn't have all the sophomores around here and all the upperclassmen yelling at us yet.

13:56.120 --> 13:57.642
And it was pretty tranquil.

14:01.468 --> 14:06.416
As you explored the campus, were there some startling surprises to you?

14:06.616 --> 14:10.021
Things you discovered that impressed you?

14:10.883 --> 14:15.830
Well, I was impressed with the Memorial Student Center, the MSC.

14:16.171 --> 14:19.596
It was just a few years old.

14:20.285 --> 14:25.331
I just couldn't believe you had all the amenities that were offered there for students.

14:25.652 --> 14:30.778
We had the, you know, the bowling alley.

14:30.838 --> 14:32.560
We had the coffee shop.

14:32.640 --> 14:34.723
We had places to eat.

14:34.823 --> 14:38.147
We had the social library.

14:38.268 --> 14:41.311
We had just any number of things like that.

14:41.452 --> 14:45.837
The Metzger gun collection up on the third floor was fascinating.

14:47.234 --> 14:56.068
And then, of course, I guess G. Raleigh White Coliseum was brand new, just been in existence a few years, and I thought it was huge.

14:57.911 --> 15:03.941
Kyle Field was incredible, although we didn't have the second and third decks at that time.

15:04.202 --> 15:09.310
It still seemed, our little high school stadium, you know, might seat 1,500.

15:09.813 --> 15:13.699
And to come to a place that was 30,000 plus was incredible.

15:15.142 --> 15:21.893
All right, then describe how you registered for your classes and what were those first classes?

15:22.634 --> 15:33.592
Well, we registered for classes, I remember, on the steps and in the area in front of Cebiza.

15:33.612 --> 15:36.377
And it was pretty...

15:36.661 --> 15:40.385
line up and get your paperwork done arrangement.

15:41.747 --> 15:48.795
And, of course, I signed up for a PE class, history class, English.

15:51.678 --> 15:58.966
Engineering 101, I didn't have the foggiest notion what that was because I was starting out in electrical engineering.

15:59.567 --> 16:00.808
It's what I thought I was going to be.

16:02.630 --> 16:04.052
Well, that was a slide rule course.

16:05.618 --> 16:08.182
Haskell, I had never seen a slide rule in my life.

16:08.363 --> 16:10.286
I did not know what a slide rule was.

16:11.648 --> 16:15.495
And I was ashamed to tell anybody that I'd never seen one.

16:16.777 --> 16:21.665
And we went to the first class, and there was this huge 12-foot slide rule hanging up there.

16:21.685 --> 16:28.216
And the professor said, gentlemen, this is a K&E slide rule.

16:29.198 --> 16:31.862
And if you don't have one, I suggest you get one.

16:32.821 --> 16:37.588
And he said, Lupo over at Northgate has some very good bargains on these things.

16:37.608 --> 16:40.793
So I went and bought my first library.

16:40.813 --> 16:43.777
And of course, I learned what it was all about.

16:43.938 --> 16:54.113
But the more I got into my academic coursework, the more I realized that probably engineering wasn't really where I needed to be.

16:59.080 --> 17:02.305
One of the hardest things to adjust to

17:03.787 --> 17:17.162
was all of the activities that went on around the dorm, at the chow hall, at the drill field, at the intramural field, everything.

17:17.943 --> 17:24.831
Now, we had call to quarters every night for three hours, usually 7.30 to 10.30 or 7 to 10, I forget the exact time.

17:24.871 --> 17:29.136
But you had, as a freshman, to be sitting at your desk,

17:29.774 --> 17:33.679
all four legs of the chair on the floor and your two feet on the floor.

17:34.320 --> 17:36.203
And they called this a six-point stance.

17:37.785 --> 17:39.387
And you had to be awake.

17:40.589 --> 17:42.011
You could not have a radio on.

17:42.632 --> 17:46.337
And I, at home, always had a radio going.

17:46.377 --> 17:50.102
And it was a difficult time.

17:50.843 --> 17:58.093
Finally, I guess I just came to the conclusion that if I was going to sit there every night for three hours, I'd just well study.

17:58.630 --> 18:00.700
And so I learned to study.

18:01.705 --> 18:06.970
And I credit the discipline that they gave us in the Corps.

18:08.435 --> 18:11.317
as the reason I finally succeeded at Texas A&M.

18:12.518 --> 18:28.432
Give some of the pluses and the minuses experiences of those first months in terms of the traditions and what others might call hazing.

18:28.452 --> 18:28.712
Right.

18:29.073 --> 18:37.800
Well, I think as much as anything, every one of us as freshmen began to realize what

18:38.708 --> 18:40.030
low life we were.

18:41.091 --> 18:45.277
And the sophomores reminded you of this every minute of the day.

18:47.340 --> 18:51.465
Now, many of my buddies were throwing in the towel.

18:51.485 --> 18:53.208
They said, I'm not going to put up with this.

18:53.648 --> 18:55.391
I'm not going to live this way.

18:56.252 --> 18:59.236
And I don't mean that it was beating with the board.

18:59.296 --> 19:00.077
That didn't happen.

19:00.117 --> 19:01.739
They were not supposed to be doing that.

19:03.882 --> 19:07.467
But it was just, you had to hit the wall.

19:08.189 --> 19:17.941
any time a sophomore or an upperclassman came by, you had to call them by name, and that was difficult.

19:18.702 --> 19:35.281
We had probably 40-some-odd freshmen in our outfit, and we had to not only know the freshmen, but all the upperclassmen.

19:35.301 --> 19:36.643
We had to know their name,

19:37.703 --> 19:39.645
their major, and their hometown.

19:42.649 --> 19:48.156
And that was a difficult thing, but yet it was very good.

19:49.819 --> 19:57.909
And we drew on our mental capacities like you can't imagine.

19:58.369 --> 20:00.713
Sorry about this coffee.

20:00.733 --> 20:06.580
But I remember I would write down all the names of the upper class

20:07.825 --> 20:11.689
And I'd memorize those.

20:11.709 --> 20:18.716
And my freshman buddies and I would spend time going over them.

20:20.277 --> 20:27.244
And the upperclassmen enjoyed trying to see if you remembered who they were.

20:27.304 --> 20:29.446
And if you didn't, you might do some push-ups.

20:29.466 --> 20:31.609
You might do various things.

20:31.629 --> 20:35.132
But here's what happened.

20:36.125 --> 20:45.320
And this was the time that I began to realize that I could have fun as a freshman.

20:45.340 --> 20:55.658
And the fun was that if we as a group of freshmen stayed together, united, we could haze the sophomores.

20:55.678 --> 20:57.180
I mean, we could haze them big time.

20:57.901 --> 21:01.828
We'd come up there and a guy would be trying to go to class and we'd all line up to whip out to him.

21:02.905 --> 21:06.909
And we'd have to tell him where we're from, what we're majoring in, and all that stuff.

21:06.929 --> 21:11.054
And we would just, and finally the sophomores would just say, get out of here freshmen.

21:11.074 --> 21:12.816
Let us, let us along.

21:14.378 --> 21:16.780
Now we had a lot of fun drowning out the sophomores.

21:17.541 --> 21:25.410
And of course, you know that procedure was you take a wastebasket full of water and find them at night and lock their door and all that good stuff.

21:25.430 --> 21:32.237
But I found out pretty soon that they couldn't hurt you, really.

21:33.128 --> 21:36.754
It was a mental game more than anything else.

21:36.774 --> 21:43.726
And if you just said, hey, I'll let this go in and out and not worry about it.

21:43.786 --> 21:53.702
My dad also had challenged me to make my grades that first semester because I had a car at home and he wouldn't let me bring it until I brought home passing grades.

21:55.265 --> 21:57.128
And so that was different.

21:58.441 --> 22:00.063
Did your outfit have a nickname?

22:01.145 --> 22:02.086
We were the Four Aces.

22:03.068 --> 22:04.009
Why?

22:04.029 --> 22:17.629
Well, it was a jet, and it had the four aces behind it as if it was flying from or over them, and that was Squadron Four, and I guess that's how they got the four aces.

22:18.250 --> 22:19.472
Aces as in playing cards?

22:19.492 --> 22:19.752
Yes.

22:20.914 --> 22:24.419
You said you mentioned board.

22:24.879 --> 22:26.642
Was there any paddling in your outfit?

22:27.179 --> 22:41.239
I can remember on one occasion where an upperclassman took a T-square and just acted like he was really going to beat on us, but he wound up breaking his T-square and it really didn't.

22:41.840 --> 22:47.128
I never really was physically hurt with a board.

22:48.138 --> 22:52.442
Was your fish old lady turned out to be a special person in your?

22:52.562 --> 22:58.949
Yeah, Jim Gatlin was my, no, excuse me, Don McGinty was my fish old lady my freshman year.

22:59.890 --> 23:01.151
And he was from my hometown.

23:02.452 --> 23:04.094
And so we had a lot in common.

23:05.596 --> 23:11.441
The only thing about McGinty was that he was a borrower.

23:12.803 --> 23:16.086
And he always seemed to want to borrow whatever I had.

23:16.792 --> 23:18.714
But that even taught you some things.

23:18.814 --> 23:22.718
When he borrowed my car, I always left it about empty, and then he'd have to buy gas.

23:22.798 --> 23:24.600
So that was one of those things you learned.

23:26.562 --> 23:28.565
What made the Four Aces special?

23:28.725 --> 23:33.290
What were y'all known for, proudest to claim?

23:33.730 --> 23:41.398
Well, I don't know that we, at that time, were, you know, among the top ten units in the Corps.

23:42.479 --> 23:45.803
But we seemed to have...

23:46.829 --> 23:48.911
Pretty good intramural teams.

23:48.931 --> 23:52.335
We seemed to have just a lot of fun.

23:53.316 --> 23:55.778
And our outfit was united.

23:55.878 --> 24:00.082
And we had some upperclassmen that made the freshmen feel good.

24:01.684 --> 24:06.769
And I remember our CO my freshman year was Ben Rector.

24:08.031 --> 24:15.418
And Ben was one of those guys that he was kind of a no-nonsense guy, and yet he never spent any time hazing freshmen.

24:16.360 --> 24:22.487
And it was, it was very, I think the people is what made it unique.

24:24.689 --> 24:30.856
Describe Chow Hall in those days and what went on and rituals and so forth.

24:31.777 --> 24:37.003
Well, of course, all freshmen, we marched to the Chow Hall and ate in Duncan.

24:38.485 --> 24:42.469
And I remember

24:42.837 --> 24:48.925
we had assigned seats and usually we had an upperclassman that we served.

24:50.187 --> 24:56.295
And there was always a freshman that sat on what's called the hot corner and all of the family style meals.

24:56.315 --> 25:07.370
And if you were as a dish that was empty or near empty, it was that freshman's job to see that it got emptied and sent back for more so that you'd never run out of anything.

25:08.812 --> 25:10.735
And, uh, naturally the,

25:11.440 --> 25:14.924
the Cush questions were always very interesting.

25:14.984 --> 25:17.167
What were some of those?

25:17.187 --> 25:26.158
Well, if the Cush was something that nobody liked, then they'd say, well, what color was General Washington's gray horse?

25:27.700 --> 25:36.291
But if it was something like chocolate eclairs, it would be a Cush question that was just almost impossible to answer.

25:37.272 --> 25:39.675
And sophomores enjoyed finding out

25:40.432 --> 25:42.535
little-known campusology facts.

25:43.636 --> 25:46.139
You know, how many bricks are there in the smokestack?

25:47.040 --> 25:48.161
Well, there was really just one.

25:48.322 --> 25:51.826
It was one in the bottom that it had its nameplate on.

25:52.647 --> 25:55.190
But nobody knew that until you'd been around a while.

25:57.433 --> 26:01.698
And, you know, they would ask a lot of very interesting questions.

26:03.780 --> 26:09.267
Did those tough Cush questions always have an answer?

26:09.567 --> 26:10.168
Oh, yes.

26:10.486 --> 26:11.327
Always had an answer.

26:11.568 --> 26:12.970
There weren't any unanswerable ones.

26:12.990 --> 26:14.713
There weren't any unanswerable questions.

26:14.793 --> 26:22.825
They knew the answers and they had to because the juniors and seniors would see to it that they were not being chicken.

26:23.887 --> 26:25.449
What was the quality of the food then?

26:29.255 --> 26:31.779
I thought the quality of the food was outstanding.

26:33.542 --> 26:36.747
I came to A&M weighing about 170 pounds.

26:37.925 --> 26:40.649
And by the end of my freshman year, I was right at 195.

26:41.651 --> 26:45.456
And so there was no shortage of opportunity to eat.

26:47.439 --> 26:51.445
What I remember well, though, was we had some upperclassmen.

26:51.465 --> 26:59.057
One of my upperclassmen that I liked, but I was his almost room orderly, was a guy named Shannon Griggs.

27:00.319 --> 27:01.080
He was a junior.

27:01.735 --> 27:04.518
And Shannon did not like to get up in the morning at all.

27:05.559 --> 27:12.687
And so my job on cold winter mornings was to be sure that I brought him some food from the dining hall.

27:13.969 --> 27:18.994
And we had milk in those little half-pint jars with lids on them.

27:19.014 --> 27:25.862
And you'd put those in the pockets of your overcoat, slip them out, and bring them back to the juniors and seniors.

27:25.882 --> 27:26.983
And that was always

27:27.250 --> 27:31.975
an interesting little game that you played with the people at the front door.

27:33.196 --> 27:37.441
But I think everybody knew that the freshmen were taking food out all the time.

27:38.181 --> 27:41.725
They didn't like us taking silverware and things.

27:41.745 --> 27:43.547
The bottles you could take out and bring them back.

27:45.209 --> 27:56.160
One of the things that was so interesting, and this just occurred to me, freshmen could not eat pineapple, kush, our freshman year.

27:57.237 --> 28:05.091
unless our freshman football team beat the University of Texas football team.

28:05.111 --> 28:14.988
And they beat them that year, and we got to eat pineapple, and we also got to wear a flat top in our outfit because of that victory.

28:15.008 --> 28:22.401
And so we thank John David Crow and Charlie Krueger and, and,

28:22.600 --> 28:30.471
Jim Wright and Roddy Osborne and the crew like that that had a good year because they had a separate team as you know.

28:31.833 --> 28:38.141
Now was that about Pineapple was that campus-wide or just for your outfit?

28:39.423 --> 28:45.451
I don't know whether it was campus-wide but I want to say it was it was our outfit I mean it was campus-wide.

28:46.092 --> 28:48.355
I think it was a pineapple dessert

28:49.246 --> 28:52.210
Any kind of pineapple upside down cake and stuff like that.

28:52.330 --> 28:54.012
What were your favorite Aggie foods?

28:54.773 --> 28:55.554
What did you like best?

28:55.695 --> 29:00.821
Well, I liked the mashed potatoes and gravy and the roast beef we had.

29:01.643 --> 29:05.588
And they always had good green beans and corn and carrots.

29:05.608 --> 29:08.412
I've always just sort of liked the family style.

29:08.492 --> 29:11.035
It would almost remind you of eating at the Black Eyed Pea.

29:12.618 --> 29:17.023
Describe a typical class day, a Monday through Saturday noon.

29:18.505 --> 29:22.169
Begin where, what happened, what did you all do in the afternoons?

29:24.252 --> 29:30.800
Well, of course, first thing after chow, we had to have our rooms ready for inspection.

29:30.820 --> 29:33.643
So you made up your bed, did all that stuff, grabbed your books.

29:34.524 --> 29:36.887
Those days you didn't know what a backpack was.

29:37.475 --> 29:41.540
And if any Aggie got caught carrying a briefcase, he was a sissy.

29:41.560 --> 29:42.521
You didn't carry a briefcase.

29:42.541 --> 29:45.004
You just had all those books under your arm.

29:46.526 --> 29:55.117
And we'd head out to class and we couldn't walk on the grass so we had to stay in the street on the sidewalk.

29:55.137 --> 30:03.307
And morning classes, anywhere from 8 o'clock on, we had morning classes.

30:03.427 --> 30:05.490
Saturdays we had 7 o'clock classes.

30:06.483 --> 30:10.768
and that seems strange to kids today that we had Saturday classes but we did.

30:10.828 --> 30:29.672
I liked to get my classes as many of them as I could in the morning and sometimes you had your labs in the afternoon but in that day and time we even had a meal formation as I recall at noon and

30:30.985 --> 30:33.127
Anyway, then after lunch, you'd come back.

30:34.389 --> 30:35.791
If you had a class, you'd go to that.

30:35.831 --> 30:38.273
Then you came back and you got to be in your fatigues or whatever.

30:39.795 --> 30:41.857
Usually we had some intramural program going.

30:42.198 --> 30:44.280
We were practicing for, getting ready for.

30:44.320 --> 30:50.768
In the football season, we had what was called the outfit sign that had to be put out in front of your dorm.

30:52.009 --> 30:58.917
And it was some caricature about whoever we were playing.

31:01.006 --> 31:09.696
If it was an owl, rice owl, well, we'd show an owl being plucked or tarred and feathered or whatever, and we were judged on those.

31:10.217 --> 31:26.296
And so we'd go down into the lounge area of our dorm, and I suppose these were on a wooden frame that was 15 by 10 at least, a piece of almost like cheesecloth, heavy cloth nailed to it.

31:27.337 --> 31:30.861
We'd go down, put those things together, and then we'd start our drawing.

31:31.432 --> 31:36.777
And we had to have it up as early for the next week as we could.

31:38.038 --> 31:45.245
Of course, then there were the outfits that burned them and they threw ink bombs at them and all kinds of stuff.

31:45.285 --> 31:46.787
So it was kind of fun to do that.

31:47.647 --> 31:53.173
But the afternoons were filled with a lot of activities.

31:53.273 --> 31:57.377
And of course, you tried to get some studying in, but freshmen didn't sleep.

31:58.157 --> 32:01.000
You didn't sleep in your room.

32:01.807 --> 32:09.077
You learn quickly that there were places in Cushing Library where you could hide and sleep.

32:10.439 --> 32:18.230
And one of my favorite places to sleep was in the church library over at Northgate where I went to the A&M Church of Christ.

32:19.372 --> 32:21.255
And we could go over there and sleep in that library.

32:21.295 --> 32:22.136
Nobody would even know it.

32:23.618 --> 32:31.189
And so, you know, it was a game in a sense that you played with the sophomores to stay out of their path.

32:32.266 --> 32:38.774
There wasn't any such thing as just sitting around and, you know, watching a video or going to a movie or anything like that.

32:38.914 --> 32:42.759
You pretty well had every minute scheduled if you were at the dorm.

32:43.320 --> 32:52.191
Would it even have been approved if you'd had an unlimited spending account to go to Northgate to have a coke and spend an hour doing that?

32:53.733 --> 32:59.119
Well, I think to some degree you got away with a little of that.

32:59.380 --> 33:00.501
You'd go check the mail.

33:01.308 --> 33:07.217
And you'd wind up, you know, getting something to drink at the MSC, have a cup of coffee, whatever.

33:08.199 --> 33:10.642
But no, you didn't ask for permission to do that.

33:10.682 --> 33:11.343
You just did it.

33:14.248 --> 33:14.769
Let's see.

33:17.653 --> 33:23.923
Some good bull that you remember that from jokes, pranks, that you remember from that freshman year.

33:25.425 --> 33:28.530
Well, we had...

33:30.147 --> 33:31.890
water fights pretty regularly.

33:33.933 --> 33:47.314
And I remember one morning, it must have been my freshman year, and I was living on the fourth floor, or as we called it, the fourth stoop.

33:48.977 --> 33:54.906
And, no, take it back, I was on the ground floor my freshman year.

33:55.358 --> 33:58.121
ground floor, and I was in room 112.

33:58.141 --> 34:02.046
I don't know why I remember that, but I do.

34:03.168 --> 34:09.295
And all of a sudden, I heard commotion in the hallway, whistles blowing.

34:10.256 --> 34:12.339
I slept on the top bunk.

34:12.359 --> 34:14.141
Don was sleeping on the second.

34:14.882 --> 34:18.226
And I jumped down out into about four inches of water in my room.

34:19.708 --> 34:22.311
And I thought, what on earth has happened?

34:23.810 --> 34:44.279
The jocks had come through the steam tunnels, come up, they'd taken, first of all in the steam tunnel they turned the water off, and then they took the head, the valves off all the heads in the restrooms, and then went down and turned the water back on.

34:46.442 --> 34:53.412
And they built a little dike, I'll never forget, across the stairway with towels.

34:54.185 --> 34:55.567
so that it would hold water.

34:57.310 --> 35:03.380
And when we woke up, the water was on the fourth floor is where they opened all the valves.

35:04.562 --> 35:06.946
And it all had to come four floors down.

35:08.448 --> 35:13.015
And I remember we mopped and baled water all night long.

35:13.516 --> 35:15.379
It was really an event.

35:15.920 --> 35:18.304
And that was a fish duty, a freshman duty.

35:18.324 --> 35:19.045
Oh, yes.

35:19.784 --> 35:30.294
Well, of course, the sophomores had to help too in that instance because there was everything in your room floating around that was on the floor.

35:31.355 --> 35:45.268
I think just thinking of wet things though, one of the, one of the strangest occurrences my freshman year was where I grew up, it was pretty dry and dusty.

35:45.288 --> 35:46.849
I have big sandstorms.

35:47.450 --> 35:48.711
Come to College Station.

35:49.518 --> 35:56.627
And for a period from September to January, there was a period in there.

35:56.667 --> 35:57.789
I don't know the exact time.

35:57.849 --> 36:00.072
But for 30 days, we did not see the sun.

36:01.434 --> 36:04.638
It rained on and off practically all the time.

36:04.658 --> 36:10.646
My shoes, my belts were mildewing in the closet.

36:10.666 --> 36:15.492
And speaking of closet, that was another thing in the military situation.

36:15.513 --> 36:18.917
You know, you had to have everything buttoned, hanging properly.

36:19.133 --> 36:22.618
And if you didn't, there was a pile of buttons on your dresser when you came back.

36:22.858 --> 36:24.280
Sophomores would come in and cut them off.

36:24.540 --> 36:26.783
They weren't buttoned.

36:26.803 --> 36:31.329
But it was a teaching experience of discipline.

36:32.972 --> 36:36.937
Did you ever participate in any good bull, in any pranks?

36:36.957 --> 36:38.178
Oh, yes.

36:38.719 --> 36:40.882
I was involved.

36:40.982 --> 36:47.571
I'll never forget the most embarrassing one of all was about the end of our freshman year.

36:48.867 --> 36:52.612
And we were in a water fight and it was final exam week.

36:54.234 --> 37:00.422
And of course, everybody's supposed to be in the dorm studying, but we're having water fight and the water fight is just with ourselves.

37:00.782 --> 37:06.510
We're not even fighting the army jocks over there or anything.

37:06.530 --> 37:12.878
Well, they had, you know, the gang restrooms with showers and all of the facilities there.

37:12.898 --> 37:16.242
And so we would go in and fill up a trash can with water.

37:17.622 --> 37:20.585
And a lot of times carry it outside then and throw it on somebody.

37:22.767 --> 37:27.732
Well, it got to where if you weren't careful after a while, you're throwing water in the hall.

37:28.753 --> 37:31.116
You're throwing water on anybody you can, any place you can.

37:32.057 --> 37:44.910
And so just about the time the restroom door was opening, I unloaded my trash can on our attack officer, Colonel Major Goff.

37:44.930 --> 37:46.752
And he was not happy.

37:47.474 --> 38:00.807
And so all of us had to go down to his office and he said, it was a final exam, end of the freshman year, and he said, gentlemen, the first thing you do when you come back next fall is report to me.

38:03.069 --> 38:07.353
Well, we had all summer then to stew about what he was going to do to us.

38:07.373 --> 38:12.057
He didn't do a thing, except torture us all summer.

38:12.077 --> 38:17.042
But I think probably some of the most memorable

38:17.950 --> 38:22.956
pranks that we pulled was when you get a sophomore that you just didn't care for.

38:25.339 --> 38:35.130
Just before a holiday one time we took, I'm not going to call names because it doesn't help, but we had a few sophomores that were just very, very hard to deal with.

38:38.394 --> 38:45.983
So we took their beds apart after they left for Thanksgiving or whenever it was.

38:47.060 --> 38:52.026
And we put shrimp up in the bed post and then put them back together.

38:53.288 --> 38:58.955
And when they came back, you can imagine the aroma in their rooms.

38:59.195 --> 39:01.118
It was not very pleasant.

39:01.138 --> 39:06.484
How long did it take them to discover the source of the shrimp, of the smell?

39:06.504 --> 39:07.546
Well, it took quite a while.

39:07.986 --> 39:08.867
It took quite a while.

39:09.288 --> 39:13.633
And we got to help wash the beds and do all kinds of good stuff.

39:13.974 --> 39:16.797
And then there was the other

39:17.992 --> 39:21.056
babo bomb that was always interesting.

39:21.076 --> 39:31.047
You take a can of babo, put a firecracker in it, cherry bomb they're called, set it in somebody's room and let it go off and everything is powdered, just covered.

39:32.449 --> 39:43.442
And the only thing worse than that would be when you took a box of scabs that was dry cereal in the vernacular of the core lingo

39:44.485 --> 39:52.339
wet it down real good and put a cherry bomb in it and then blow it off in a guy's room and let it sit over a weekend.

39:53.141 --> 39:59.131
And to get those cornflakes or whatever off of the ceiling and off of everything, almost had to have a chisel.

40:00.414 --> 40:05.683
And that always gave you a lot of satisfaction to see the sophomores try to figure out who did it.

40:07.908 --> 40:14.394
As that year began to end, how did you feel about being an Aggie?

40:16.336 --> 40:23.222
Well, I think by the time we got into that last semester, we had what was called Fish Day.

40:24.984 --> 40:27.005
I need information about Fish Day.

40:27.226 --> 40:31.590
And Fish Day was the day when the fish got to act like sophomores.

40:32.631 --> 40:35.333
And we got to tell the sophomores what to do.

40:36.460 --> 40:46.195
And it was sort of the coming out party almost for the fish when you're about to turn to sophomores.

40:47.357 --> 40:48.458
And we had a lot of fun.

40:48.859 --> 40:57.672
And we began, I think, to realize to some degree that being a sophomore wasn't quite as much fun as we thought it was going to be.

40:58.814 --> 41:04.122
Because they expect you to be more dignified and you couldn't say,

41:04.827 --> 41:07.150
Sir, not being informed of the highest degree of accuracy.

41:08.713 --> 41:10.956
I'm, you know, I'm a very dumb fish and cannot remember.

41:11.637 --> 41:13.800
I mean, you have that little slogan that you're always quoting.

41:15.482 --> 41:18.707
And, but as a sophomore, you were supposed to know better.

41:21.892 --> 41:26.839
And so we realized pretty fast that being a sophomore wasn't a lot of fun.

41:27.239 --> 41:30.925
One other prank that I'll always remember, it was a lot of fun.

41:32.327 --> 41:34.530
And yet it was fun.

41:35.658 --> 41:37.240
because we created it.

41:38.983 --> 41:45.172
But our juniors came to us just before the sophomore ball that was coming up.

41:46.494 --> 41:55.889
And to have a big sophomore party and affair like this, the dance and everything, you had to have class A uniforms, which meant your blouses.

41:57.311 --> 42:02.359
And they said, you mean y'all are not going to steal the sophomore's blouses?

42:02.379 --> 42:04.602
And we didn't know you were supposed to, but they told us.

42:05.155 --> 42:08.539
So we slipped around and stole all of the sophomore blouses.

42:08.559 --> 42:16.329
Of course, the juniors were quick to take them off on some kind of an excursion so we could steal them.

42:16.349 --> 42:26.142
And one of the guys in my outfit, Sam Talo, and two or three others took them to San Antonio and put them in the cleaners.

42:26.162 --> 42:30.387
And so for a week,

42:30.772 --> 43:00.171
before the sophomore ball they were trying to get us to tell them where their blouses were and of course you had the juniors grinning and laughing because we did this and you had the sophomores mad because they couldn't go to the event without them so I remember we started off probably it was on a Sunday night and they

43:00.556 --> 43:06.003
let us go to bed, and then about 11 o'clock they blow the whistle and said, all you freshmen fall out.

43:07.225 --> 43:11.992
We want you in your helmet liners, raincoats, and tennis shoes.

43:14.956 --> 43:16.878
They handed every one of us a spoon.

43:18.481 --> 43:21.224
They took a trash can at one end and filled it with water.

43:22.346 --> 43:29.736
Took a trash can at the other end, and we had to walk with the spoons full of water all the way down to the other end and dump it in.

43:31.117 --> 43:32.078
We did that all night.

43:33.520 --> 43:35.823
Well, the next night, they started doing this again.

43:38.026 --> 43:44.996
And we were having so much fun, and we were so sleepy that we would just kick the full bucket of water over and let it spill.

43:45.757 --> 43:50.263
And finally, the juniors just chewed out the sophomores and said, leave those freshmen alone.

43:51.605 --> 44:00.617
Well, then we had to start going to class wearing our raincoats, helmet liners, and carrying a broom.

44:02.386 --> 44:05.169
And then at noon, we added a mop.

44:05.189 --> 44:07.451
And then the next morning, we added a footlocker.

44:08.132 --> 44:10.974
And we had to carry all of this stuff with us to class.

44:12.636 --> 44:19.022
And everybody would say, well, squadron fours, sophomores are after the freshmen.

44:19.042 --> 44:21.945
We scrubbed the dorm with toothbrushes.

44:23.407 --> 44:30.013
I mean, we did everything imaginable that was demeaning to try to get us to tell them where their blouses were.

44:32.710 --> 44:40.983
And I think Saturday morning, finally, before the Saturday night event, the juniors came to us and said, guys, y'all have pulled it off.

44:41.624 --> 44:42.605
Get those blouses.

44:43.387 --> 44:47.593
And so we had somebody from San Antonio bring them, and they got them back.

44:48.515 --> 44:55.866
But that was a week-long experience of agony, but we created it, and so we were happy about it.

44:57.955 --> 45:04.022
Did you feel, how did you feel about coming back as a sophomore?

45:04.682 --> 45:05.583
Couldn't wait to get back.

45:06.805 --> 45:08.206
We actually came early.

45:09.007 --> 45:14.533
Even though they didn't have, you know, Fish Orientation Week then, but we wanted to get back early.

45:15.494 --> 45:17.557
What was it like to be a sophomore?

45:19.379 --> 45:27.928
Well, there was a sense of pride about being a sophomore that we had made it through that fish year.

45:28.887 --> 45:37.138
There was a period of sadness also because we lost over half our freshmen.

45:37.158 --> 45:43.467
And by the time we graduated, there was only about 25% of us that graduated.

45:44.208 --> 45:48.774
So it was a devastating loss to us to lose those good buddies.

45:48.794 --> 45:51.198
Now you said lost about half of them first year.

45:51.638 --> 45:54.422
Was it the end of the first semester or the second semester?

45:55.010 --> 46:03.062
Well, you lost a lot of them the first two or three weeks, more of them at the end of the semester, more of them at the second semester.

46:03.082 --> 46:07.869
What would be your guesstimate as to how many of them flunked out compared to dropouts?

46:08.410 --> 46:14.439
I would say at least a third of them flunked out, at least.

46:16.281 --> 46:24.173
And it was somehow they did not have that ability to do all the extracurricular stuff and still make their grades.

46:25.790 --> 46:28.333
Now, I think we scooted, I'm looking back at Fish Day.

46:28.814 --> 46:29.855
Fish Day was when?

46:31.217 --> 46:37.725
It was in the second semester, a few weeks before final review.

46:38.206 --> 46:39.948
And this was a turnaround where y'all?

46:40.008 --> 46:43.653
It was a turnaround where we got to be sophomores for a day.

46:45.395 --> 46:50.822
And it, I can't recall, I think it was campus-wide, but I'm not certain.

46:50.902 --> 46:54.767
It could have been different outfits did it at different times, but I think it was pretty much campus-wide.

46:55.321 --> 46:59.529
Did the sophomores kind of say to you, just wait until tomorrow finish?

46:59.549 --> 47:00.130
Oh, yes.

47:00.150 --> 47:00.731
Oh, yes.

47:00.751 --> 47:01.473
They loved that.

47:01.994 --> 47:03.096
Don't be too hard on me.

47:03.116 --> 47:08.125
Remember, I got the rest of the semester to get back at you.

47:08.626 --> 47:15.760
Were there some key teachers, instructors, advisors you had that first year?
