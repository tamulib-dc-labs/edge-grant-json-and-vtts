WEBVTT

00:01.398 --> 00:04.502
So, we were talking about General Wainwright. 
Well, General Wainwright and I were together on

00:04.682 --> 00:08.327
several trips. He seemed to take a liking to me. It 
might have been partly due to the fact that he knew

00:11.111 --> 00:17.619
my cousin, Fletcher Sharp, so well. But anyway, he 
and I, we went out to, I think to Bandera or

00:18.421 --> 00:30.156
someplace and they gave him a beautiful horse and a 
silver mounted saddle and made him an honorary

00:32.110 --> 00:39.758
deputy sheriff of Bandera County, and made me an 
honorary deputy sheriff of Bandera County. On

00:41.139 --> 00:58.337
another trip, I was with about 18 other general 
officers and wives who were guests of the Mexican

00:41.139 --> 00:58.337
government, and on that trip,

01:00.916 --> 01:17.014
We would go- I've been to Mexico City so many times 
that it was uninteresting to me and it was

01:00.916 --> 01:17.014
uninteresting to General Wainwright after so 
long time because he was looking for a place to get a

01:00.916 --> 01:17.014
drink. So about 11 a.m. with all the sights anyway 
about 11 a.m. General Wainwright would say, come

01:18.316 --> 01:30.670
on Beverly let's go strike a blow for liberty.

01:31.848 --> 01:36.835
We'd repair the nearest bar for a drink and let the 
rest of the party go. Well, that got to be sort of

01:38.617 --> 01:40.239
routine. Well, I liked the old fellow, but he was 
pretty well shot physically when he got home. What

01:48.711 --> 01:49.231
a shame. He needed whiskey just to keep going. How 
about General Spouts? General who? Spouts.

01:57.362 --> 01:58.564
Spots. S-P-A-A-T-Z. Spatz. Who? Spatz. 
S-P-A-A-T-Z. Oh, Spatz. That's pronounced

02:09.278 --> 02:10.339
Spatz. Oh, he was a fine officer. He was our first 
Chief of Air Force. After we got the separate Air

02:18.286 --> 02:24.811
Force, he was the first man to be selected Chief of 
Air Force. I was on two trips with him. One to Rio and

02:29.459 --> 02:39.351
Sao Paulo, Brazil and on another trip to Mexico 
City and on down to Acapulco on a fishing trip. And

02:41.033 --> 02:43.215
he and I were good friends. Now why did you, was this 
after the war? Yeah. Why did you go to Mexico after

02:46.219 --> 02:48.602
the war so often? Was this to build relations? Oh, 
we had fine relations with the Mexican Air Force

02:50.304 --> 02:58.774
and the Mexican General Salinas. He was chief of 
the Mexican Air Force. He used to come up and visit

03:03.243 --> 03:08.130
me and Kelly quite often. Sometimes he'd bring his 
wife along and do a little shopping at our post

03:08.771 --> 03:12.516
exchange.

03:16.041 --> 03:18.305
You all sound like a scandal sheet in here. Well, 
honey, this doesn't go any farther than that. I

03:24.353 --> 03:28.980
hope not. We're just talking about famous people. 
Yeah, Spots and I were good friends. We played gin

03:34.587 --> 03:44.963
and rummy all the way from Washington to Rio and Sao 
Paulo and all the way back to Washington.

03:45.944 --> 03:48.148
Kept books on it and broke exactly even. Really?

03:52.096 --> 04:00.347
Now while you were the commander at Kelly, in 1946 
you received an honorary doctorate of law from

03:52.096 --> 04:00.347
Texas A&M. Yeah. Tell me about that. Well, at that 
time there were about 28 or 29

04:04.173 --> 04:15.388
general officers, A&M men. I think maybe it was one 
admiral and 28 generals. And they decided to make

04:21.408 --> 04:26.595
us all honorary doctors of law. And they also 
invited Eisenhower to come at the same time and

04:28.497 --> 04:39.131
made him an honorary doctor of law. So that's the 
only degree I have. I never finished the A&M. I went

04:45.480 --> 04:47.002
there just for two years. What did you think of the 
ceremony? It was very nice. I now made an

04:51.580 --> 04:54.725
acceptance speech for all of it.

04:58.691 --> 05:04.601
It's just one of those nice things that happen to 
you if you're in a high place. General officers,

05:06.444 --> 05:12.413
you get a lot of medals and you get these honorary 
degrees. What was the highest ranking A&M officer

05:12.814 --> 05:16.019
at the time? Do you remember? Was he a horse? No, I 
think it was three-star. I think it was Lieutenant

05:19.991 --> 05:21.653
General Bruce.

05:25.597 --> 05:32.503
Somewhere I've got a list of the

05:25.597 --> 05:32.503
officers that received that. Well, I'm sure we do 
it in the archives too, and I'm sure they have that

05:33.324 --> 05:37.889
in the battalion. I remember there was a General 
Moore, and he wasn't there because I think he was in

05:37.929 --> 05:43.934
the hospital. He had been over in Corregidor. In

05:48.078 --> 05:58.076
May of 1947, you lost your command and you were 
transferred. What were your feelings about that?

06:01.442 --> 06:05.750
In 1947, I... Did I say 74? I meant 47. Yep, 47. I was 
ordered to Brazil, is that what you're talking

06:09.205 --> 06:12.490
about? Yeah, I was wondering about your feelings. 
Well, I knew I couldn't be commanding general at

06:14.893 --> 06:23.827
Kelly forever, so I'd already held the job longer 
than anybody previous to me.

06:26.671 --> 06:36.145
So, of course, I figured, well, that's what 
Washington wants, that's what I want, so

06:26.671 --> 06:36.145
I went down there. I didn't have anything to do when 
I got there much, As the military and the Air

06:39.007 --> 06:42.230
Attaché in Debrazile. Combination. Army 
Attaché, as the military Attaché and Air Attaché

06:44.112 --> 06:51.439
combination. That's when we were still part of the 
Army. While I was down there, the separate Air

06:54.081 --> 07:05.892
Force Act went through and then I just became the 
Air Attaché.

07:07.019 --> 07:10.463
I got along fine with Brazil and made some fine 
friends down there. I made some friends among

07:10.483 --> 07:21.477
other Attachés, a Canadian Attaché, a 
Spanish-era Attaché, and his wife were good

07:10.483 --> 07:21.477
friends of ours. Did

07:21.538 --> 07:27.545
you travel throughout the country quite a bit? 
Yes, I traveled. I had a DC-3

07:29.808 --> 07:36.857
assigned to me for the purpose of getting around 
and inspecting other countries, and I certainly

07:37.377 --> 07:45.065
took advantage of that by going to every country in 
South America. Really? Including the Dutch, the

07:46.486 --> 07:53.793
Guyana, the Dutch Guyana, the British Guyana, and 
British Guyana. And sometimes I'd take other

07:53.813 --> 08:07.367
attachés and their wives along, and take my wife 
along,

07:53.813 --> 08:07.367
and just sightseeing business. It's a goodwill. 
Good relations. Goodwill, and that's about all we

08:13.458 --> 08:15.181
got. And how were the relations with South 
America? All good. Good? All good, yeah. Of

08:22.851 --> 08:33.046
course, at this time, we were fighting communism 
in Europe, at least ideologically, and also in

08:22.851 --> 08:33.046
Latin America. Was there fear that communists 
might win some victories in South America? At that

08:37.975 --> 08:53.632
time, communism hadn't crept in anywhere in South 
America, not even Georgetown, British Ghana.

08:53.912 --> 09:00.239
I did make one interesting trip.

09:02.982 --> 09:04.624
Got some Brazilian officers. and we took off and 
flew over to Bolivia in a place called Santa Clara

09:05.718 --> 09:30.004
de la Sierra, and then I flew directly north to try 
to hit a town called Porto Velho, which is at the end

09:05.718 --> 09:30.004
of a railroad, a railroad about 150 mile long 
railroad that goes from Puerto Velho south into

09:30.710 --> 09:39.819
where they used to get rubber. It was made, the 
railroad was put in there just to ship the raw

09:41.380 --> 09:51.630
rubber down to Puerto Velho where it was processed 
into big balls about this big around. And then it

09:52.631 --> 10:00.379
was shipped by steamer from Puerto Velho down 
through Manaus and on north up the Amazon River. at

10:00.933 --> 10:07.081
the United States and wherever else in Hawaii. I 
saw a lot of jungle on that trip. If the airplane had

10:10.485 --> 10:16.913
gone down, we'd have been like the Kingsley I 
expected in Nicaragua. They probably never found

10:18.315 --> 10:19.356
us. In Puerto Vallejo, they treated us right 
royally. I even made a speech in Portuguese after a

10:26.265 --> 10:30.450
couple of drinks. I'd loosen up my tongue.

10:38.182 --> 10:43.607
They took us out the next day to an Indian camp along 
the river there. We bought some bows and arrows and

10:43.627 --> 10:51.075
beads and necklaces and whatnot. And the next day 
we flew on down to Manalas and we were guests of the

10:51.095 --> 10:59.543
governor of the territory of Manalas, the 
territory of Amazonas. and he took us out on his

11:01.244 --> 11:07.672
yacht and had lunch. Anybody who wanted to fish 
could fish. I didn't want to fish, so I never did

11:11.577 --> 11:21.330
care much about fishing.

11:21.370 --> 11:30.762
The confluence of the three rivers that come 
together there in Manaus, one from the west that

11:21.370 --> 11:30.762
rides in Peru and Venezuela, One from the south, 
which Puerto Vallarta is on, that's called the

11:31.957 --> 11:36.683
Madera River. And one from the southeast, I forget 
the name of that river, but they all come together

11:38.626 --> 11:50.222
there at Manaus to form the Amazon. And that Amazon 
River at Manaus is 50 feet deep. Steamers,

11:55.028 --> 11:59.314
ocean-going steamers, can come all the way up 
there. from a thousand miles down at the port.

12:02.407 --> 12:03.610
That's the land. Come up there. That was a river a 
thousand miles to Manalas. It is so level that the

12:10.823 --> 12:14.790
tide rises and falls there. No kidding. At 
Manalas.

12:22.284 --> 12:23.125
Well, it sounds like Compared to the 
responsibilities of having Kelly Air Force Base,

12:23.915 --> 12:32.465
this is pretty easy duty. Yeah, it was too easy for 
me. I like work I can get my teeth into. And

12:38.452 --> 12:45.801
this is more of being a diplomat, wasn't it, than 
being an officer? Yeah, just friendly diplomatic

12:45.821 --> 12:50.547
stuff. The Brazilian were very friendly with us. I 
had a whole division over in Italy fighting with

12:53.254 --> 12:56.999
us. And like a squadron of air force over there. And 
Marshal Mascarenhas,

13:02.525 --> 13:20.145
who was commanding over in Italy, he wrote a book 
and gave me an autographed copy of it here.

13:26.622 --> 13:28.906
Yeah, you can read that someday when you want. How

13:28.926 --> 13:45.211
nice. I could read it if I wanted to, but I don't.

13:52.880 --> 13:56.746
expeditionary force that they have been. Were you 
happy to leave the job? I was happy to leave Brazil

14:01.293 --> 14:05.058
and get back to this country. Why? Because living 
conditions in Rio are poor. It's very, very

14:13.191 --> 14:15.815
expensive. I had to pay to rent an apartment. I had 
to pay under the table money, a thousand cruzeros,

14:22.867 --> 14:45.572
which at that time was about $250, just for the 
privilege of signing a lease on, at the lawful

14:22.867 --> 14:45.572
rate, had rent control. And that went against my 
grain, of course, and it was a very poor, it was a

14:45.592 --> 14:52.620
brand new apartment building, but they were 
poorly constructed. No heat in it at all, and it

14:58.713 --> 15:02.858
gets cold there in the wintertime. We got a little 
electric

15:04.240 --> 15:15.055
heater, and that soon burned out the wiring, and we 
put a cheap wiring in the thing. Our windows fit so

15:15.075 --> 15:18.699
poorly that we took towels and stuff. They were 
double-hung windows, and we took towels and

15:19.360 --> 15:22.084
stuff. I was wondering why they had a brigadier 
general as the attache. Isn't it usually a

15:32.018 --> 15:33.300
colonel? No, that's what they had. Some had one in 
Argentina and one in Brazil. I believe Venezuela

15:45.416 --> 15:50.923
had a brigadier general, I'm not sure. Apparently 
they bumped up the rank that they deserved.

16:00.340 --> 16:07.711
So when you came back to the United States in 1948,

16:00.340 --> 16:07.711
then what? Did you know that you were going to 
retire then? I figured, yeah. You figured that you

16:12.818 --> 16:13.880
would? I figured I was going to retire, and

16:13.900 --> 16:21.231
they put me on them. promotion board first in 
Washington on temporary duty there, and when I got

16:22.527 --> 16:36.784
through that duty, I asked to be sent back to Kelly 
Field and put on a retired list, which I did. Well,

16:37.625 --> 16:39.528
it says you were ordered into retirement. Yeah. 
Well, how did that come about? Well, that's the way

16:45.254 --> 16:47.898
that, that's the way it's worded. You're ordered 
into retirement. But you had decided I decided I

16:52.042 --> 16:54.004
wanted to retire, yeah. When did you decide that? 
Down in Brazil when I got this hip arthritis in my

16:55.766 --> 17:01.272
head.

17:11.462 --> 17:16.968
So, I retired in July 31st, I believe it was, 1949. 
How'd you feel on your retirement day? Oh, I felt

17:22.214 --> 17:24.816
like I was too young to just quit work. I was 52 years 
old, so I started looking around. I tried to start a

17:29.881 --> 17:39.750
bank there at Kellyfield, and I had all those 
civilian employees, and not all of them, a great

17:29.881 --> 17:39.750
many of them wanted to put money in it. I wrote to all 
the general officers I knew that they all wanted

17:40.010 --> 17:52.221
stock in the bank, but I hadn't done my homework, so 
I didn't know how to start a bank. I wanted to be

17:52.825 --> 17:54.508
president of the bank. Kelly, that's what I wanted 
to do.

17:59.515 --> 18:03.281
I hadn't done my homework, so I never could get it 
started. I've got one there now. Did you look

18:05.144 --> 18:09.350
forward to civilian life? Oh, yeah. Did they put a 
big, did they have a nice celebration for you?

18:14.778 --> 18:16.841
Well, they had a parade, yeah. Was that at Kelly? At 
Kelly,

18:18.163 --> 18:21.448
yeah.

18:27.453 --> 18:39.928
Now, when you were advancing in your military 
career, at first, of course, it was a very slow

18:27.453 --> 18:39.928
advancement because of the promotion system, and 
then it was very quick advancement. But did you

18:39.948 --> 18:52.743
leave your advancement to fate, or did you, were 
you consciously, did you think that you had some

18:39.948 --> 18:52.743
control over your promotions? No, I didn't have 
any control over them. I could have probably

18:56.866 --> 19:13.267
gotten a second and a third star if I wanted to

18:56.866 --> 19:13.267
more or less be conformist to what everybody 
wanted, I mean the higher ups. I was too much of an

19:14.529 --> 19:23.340
individualist to be promoted.

19:23.440 --> 19:26.164
I won my promotion in spite of the fact that If I was a 
maverick, that's the best way I could get. Well,

19:29.468 --> 19:33.213
can you give me some examples of you being a 
maverick? Oh, yes, I never... If I thought my

19:36.057 --> 19:44.829
commanding officer was wrong, I would hesitate to 
go in and tell him things like that. If I thought the

19:45.771 --> 19:51.679
policy was wrong, I'd write a letter about it or 
talk about it. Was there some specific policy or

19:52.300 --> 19:57.865
letter that you wrote that really got you in 
trouble? No. Oh, yeah. I got in touch with General

20:02.009 --> 20:13.841
Sandy Fairchild in Washington when I was there as 
chief of the inspection. He wanted me to be new, and

20:15.642 --> 20:19.506
I knew all these basic matters. He wanted me to give 
him a secret report on that and the poor ones. And I

20:27.766 --> 20:31.750
told him that I didn't like to give secret reports 
on anybody. If I gave a report on a substance, such

20:33.531 --> 20:50.826
an officer was a poor base commander, I would put it 
in a letter and cite the reasons and send it to the

20:33.531 --> 20:50.826
base, said base commander, for comment. And Sandy 
didn't like that. He wanted a secret business.

21:03.981 --> 21:05.702
So he never did like me after that. And he was a very 
powerful marshal. He was Vandenberg's assistant

21:09.085 --> 21:15.671
when Vandenberg was chief of staff. Vandenberg 
was a good friend of mine. But Fairchild was down on

21:23.122 --> 21:26.386
me. And that was one reason

21:26.406 --> 21:34.256
I never got any higher, which it didn't bother me. I 
wasn't out

21:36.259 --> 21:42.286
to push myself up. Would you consider yourself 
ambitious?

21:47.773 --> 21:50.297
Not very many people make general. I don't think 
that I was ambitious. I wanted whatever I was due,

21:54.347 --> 21:58.715
justly due. You wanted to do the job, right? I don't 
think that I was ever trying to push myself for a

22:02.902 --> 22:09.073
promotion. I can't remember. But do you think that 
as far as advancement is concerned, I'm

22:10.315 --> 22:17.007
interested in the question of people advance to 
become leaders in the military the same way? Do you

22:20.900 --> 22:26.747
do the same things as you advance to become leaders 
in the corporate world or the professional world?

22:28.208 --> 22:30.090
I expect it's going to be the same. I don't know. I 
never thought of it. I never thought of it that way.

22:36.256 --> 22:37.017
But I expect it. There's a lot of favoritism, I 
expect it, in the corporate world and promotion.

22:45.987 --> 22:47.348
And I know there is. military. Well, what do you 
mean a lot of favoritism? Do you think there's more

22:51.428 --> 22:55.434
favoritism in the military or do you think it's... 
There's some favoritism. You can't get away from

22:57.056 --> 22:58.258
it. Joe Doakes is the head of mine in Washington. He 
has his friends that he's known since they went

23:03.105 --> 23:06.870
through the academy together. They went through 
A&M together. They were buddies in the air

23:10.936 --> 23:16.845
tactical school.

23:18.277 --> 23:26.308
You can't get away from favoritism and 
promotions.

23:26.468 --> 23:31.976
These big heads of corporations, they're bound to 
have their own favorites. Do you think that

23:31.996 --> 23:43.432
there's sort of a West Point club in which the 
people, you know, there's always this grumbling

23:31.996 --> 23:43.432
that people at West Point get promoted fast? I 
don't think they do in the Air Force. You can look

23:46.756 --> 23:48.098
over there. The generals in the Air Force, I think 
you'll find just as many from one school as another

23:48.398 --> 23:54.725
almost. And maybe we have more from West Point, 
yes, and say Georgia Tech, maybe more than the A&M.

24:02.834 --> 24:04.195
But that's their business. They turn out, what, 
1,400 a year or 1,200 or something like that. And

24:10.983 --> 24:13.225
career men and... I think there's bound to be more 
general officers from West Point than there is

24:14.403 --> 24:20.831
from these other schools. So I wouldn't call that 
favorite to me. Okay. Now, you wrote that

24:24.977 --> 24:34.028
memorandum on leadership, and we're going to keep 
that on file there, and we're going to send it back

24:24.977 --> 24:34.028
here. But I'd like you to define leadership for me, 
if you would. Well, let me see my notes here. It's

24:45.115 --> 24:53.246
hard, it's hard to define

24:45.115 --> 24:53.246
it. The first question I think was probably why

24:53.407 --> 25:04.983
certain people get to be leaders. They have the 
ability

25:05.003 --> 25:10.971
inherently enhanced by living in freedom, and so 
on and so forth. I got all these answers here. And I

25:16.512 --> 25:24.139
think you can gather from that what my general 
philosophy is on leadership. We'll keep that

25:24.199 --> 25:25.120
there. Go ahead. Well, Xerox, in the military, 
there's different types of leaders, of course.

25:32.867 --> 25:39.993
One was sort of the combat-type Patton, and 
another one was sort of the manager-type

25:32.867 --> 25:39.993
Eisenhower. Yeah. What type do you think you were? 
I think I was a management type. Okay.

25:52.419 --> 25:53.801
I never was in combat.

25:56.725 --> 26:02.714
I practiced for it when I was a pursuit commander. 
Okay. Now finally, I'd just like to ask you a couple

26:04.630 --> 26:14.240
of questions about Texas A&M and your ideas on 
Texas A&M. I hate to see the Corps, such a small

26:14.260 --> 26:23.870
percentage of the men who go there, and I guess 
women too. Women look like women are going to get

26:23.890 --> 26:34.401
into the armed forces, and what do we got, about 15% 
women now? What's your opinion of that? I think

26:38.709 --> 26:45.996
it's possibly 15% of the jobs that can be done by 
women, but I think it'd be better if we didn't have

26:38.709 --> 26:45.996
them. I think it'd be better if we had just men. 
Okay. What do you think about women being at Texas

26:51.802 --> 26:54.345
A&M? When you went to A&M, there weren't any women. 
Well... Any women students. What do you think

26:58.829 --> 27:01.772
about allowing them in Texas A&M?

27:06.595 --> 27:12.661
Well, since Texas A&M is not primarily a military 
school, I guess I see no reason why they shouldn't

27:06.595 --> 27:12.661
be there.

27:16.144 --> 27:28.175
It's a primary and educational institution, and 
there's a certain percentage of women that should

27:16.144 --> 27:28.175
be right along with the men when it comes to 
education. Okay. Now, during the 1960s, we

27:29.497 --> 27:32.540
allowed General Rutter. Did you ever know General 
Rutter, by the way? No, I didn't. When General

27:36.667 --> 27:41.334
Rudder was the president and he allowed women in. 
Also, during the 1960s, blacks were allowed into

27:41.915 --> 27:47.703
Texas A&M for the first time. What was your opinion 
of that? Wax? Blacks. Oh, blacks. Well, I think

27:52.430 --> 27:58.119
they deserve to be in there, the same as whites, if 
they can keep up. Okay. I think there's a certain

27:59.601 --> 28:05.830
percentage of blacks that have just as fine brains 
as... Above average whites. The percentage is

28:09.278 --> 28:15.848
lower than whites

28:09.278 --> 28:15.848
for many, many reasons. But there's some blacks 
that have become, I think, brilliant men and

28:15.868 --> 28:25.082
brilliant leaders. You didn't have any blacks in 
the Air Force in integrated units until after you

28:25.102 --> 28:32.873
retired. I believe not, yeah. I think they were 
just coming in. And what was your opinion toward

28:39.077 --> 28:42.123
integrating the Air Force? It was okay

28:44.227 --> 28:49.197
with me. I don't think you can discriminate 
against, or should discriminate against blacks

28:49.217 --> 28:57.813
due to color. Okay. And finally, what do you think 
about now, as you say, the Corps is a small

28:59.455 --> 29:14.472
percentage of students at A&M because it's no 
longer mandatory for people to be in the Corps of

28:59.455 --> 29:14.472
Cadets at Texas A&M. What's your opinion of ending 
the mandatory rule?

29:20.499 --> 29:25.325
Well, as I said before, it's not primarily a 
military institution. Right. I see no reason why

29:28.092 --> 29:32.297
it should be mandatory for them to be in the Corps.

29:35.280 --> 29:41.066
I'd like to see more of them volunteer to be in the 
Corps, but that may come later. We had a long period

29:42.888 --> 29:49.115
here of permissiveness where we were raising a 
bunch of brats. I'm sure some of them got into A&M

29:50.036 --> 29:56.783
and we wouldn't even want them in the Corps.

29:58.265 --> 30:08.701
I look to see more, I expect to see more of the 
students that are in the Corps in the future than

29:58.265 --> 30:08.701
they are now. I hope so. What do you think about 
reinstating the draft? Do you think we should have

30:16.232 --> 30:18.956
a volunteer service or a draft? I don't think women 
should be drafted. Well, what about men? Right now

30:25.266 --> 30:26.888
we have a volunteer service. I think it was a 
mistake to ever put it in. And I think we'll

30:32.013 --> 30:43.046
eventually have to probably go back to the draft 
just

30:32.013 --> 30:43.046
to keep up our strength in our forces. If you keep 
trying to pay them as much as they were getting

30:43.466 --> 30:56.841
civilian lives, it looks to me like it makes the top 
heavy in pay. versus equipment, hardware and

30:57.412 --> 31:00.737
software.

31:06.146 --> 31:15.442
Yeah, I think Nixon made a mistake

31:06.146 --> 31:15.442
in demanding him the draft because it's going to be 
awful hard to put it back in. Yeah, sure it is. I'm

31:18.809 --> 31:20.732
about out of questions, General. Is there 
anything else that you'd like to talk about as far

31:20.892 --> 31:24.116
as your career? We have your manuscript that I'm 
going to take back, which is your memoirs, and your

31:24.156 --> 31:31.807
ideas of leadership, which are down on paper in El 
Xerox. Is there anything that you think we should

31:33.189 --> 31:35.993
talk about? I can't think of anything, Terry. I 
think we've covered everything that I can think

31:38.256 --> 31:47.989
of, and if there's anything that I think of, later 
why I can put it in under remarks. Sure, you can edit

31:53.075 --> 31:55.118
it right in. And I may think of some other things, 
but right now I'm out of ideas. Thank you very much

32:02.407 --> 32:06.472
in general for this interview. Well, I'm very 
happy to do it.
