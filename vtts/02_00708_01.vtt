00:08.435 --> 00:13.641
This is an interview with Dr. Thomas J. Kozik, 
professor of mechanical engineering. Today's

00:13.661 --> 00:16.444
date is October 1, 1981. Let's begin, Dr. Kozik, by 
your telling us something about your early years,

00:17.726 --> 00:24.774
where you were born, when, and so forth. I was born 
in Jersey City, New Jersey, on April the 9th, 1930.

00:31.602 --> 00:35.607
The section of Jersey City was the downtown 
section, which was the landing spot for most of the

00:37.477 --> 00:40.521
immigrants who came from Europe. My mother and my 
father both came from Poland. In the early years,

00:44.586 --> 00:49.292
downtown Jersey City was broken up into three 
ethnic areas. There was the Polish area, there was

00:49.392 --> 00:54.378
the Italian area, and then there was the Irish 
area. But in reality, the Irish area wasn't a

00:54.719 --> 01:03.029
single identifiable area because the Irish 
happened to rule the city. These were the days of

01:03.329 --> 01:06.994
Mayor Haig and the political machine. The Poles 
and the Italians provided most of the physical

01:08.881 --> 01:16.312
labor force for Jersey City. That labor force 
typically was employed on the docks, was employed

01:16.332 --> 01:31.995
in the, not stock markets, but slaughterhouses, 
and was employed in the various warehouses. This

01:32.015 --> 01:34.399
was backbreaking type of work. I didn't speak 
English until I was age six because there was no

01:35.493 --> 01:40.019
need to in my section. People in the various ethnic 
areas spoke the language and maintained the

01:41.141 --> 01:48.511
culture of their home country.

01:51.174 --> 02:05.213
Upon going to parochial school, I learned and 
began to speak English, graduated from parochial

01:51.174 --> 02:05.213
school, and then went to Ferris High School, which 
was the public high school at the RRIS. This was the

02:06.526 --> 02:10.132
public high school for the downtown residents.

02:13.417 --> 02:19.528
Having graduated from Ferris, I was very 
fortunate to be accepted to Rensselaer

02:13.417 --> 02:19.528
Polytechnic Institute. That was rather unique 
because no one from the downtown area. That's up in

02:23.715 --> 02:27.881
Troy, New York. Let me ask you about your parents. 
What did your father do for a living? came to this

02:33.205 --> 02:47.401
country in about 1904-1905

02:33.205 --> 02:47.401
as a young man from what is now Poland, but in those 
days was simply a part of the territory of the

02:33.205 --> 02:47.401
Austro-Hungarian Empire. He was, I believe, 16, 
he tells me, and his prime reason for leaving

02:48.542 --> 02:54.469
Poland was he was about to be drafted into the 
Austrian army. And many immigrants in those days

02:55.731 --> 03:01.457
wanted nothing to do with the service, and so he 
fled from Poland and went to, I believe, Hamburg

03:02.585 --> 03:12.360
and saved and got enough money together to come to 
this country on steerage. My father always told me

03:13.622 --> 03:21.013
that he literally hid behind a woman's skirt 
because he mentioned that in crossing the border,

03:13.622 --> 03:21.013
there were passport checks. And the Austrian 
government was very concerned about keeping

03:23.096 --> 03:30.027
people in, especially people of military age. So, 
as he was crossing the border from what was then the

03:30.850 --> 03:54.900
Polish territory into the German territory, the 
inspector came along the train, and a group of

03:30.850 --> 03:54.900
peasant women with their long flowing skirts were 
sitting on a bench, and they knew what the

03:30.850 --> 03:54.900
situation was, and my father looked panicky, and 
they told him quick to get onto the bench, which he

03:30.850 --> 03:54.900
did, and then they spread their skirts over him, 
and the inspector never saw them. Years later,

03:56.112 --> 04:00.738
when I was drafted into the army, my father told me 
that he thought I was the failure in the family. I

04:00.778 --> 04:02.281
wasn't able to escape the draft. At any rate, he 
came to this country. Well, he came across on

04:04.944 --> 04:10.131
steerage, and he told something about the trips 
and the steerage trip itself. Basically, it was a

04:10.212 --> 04:14.217
hole in which all of the immigrants were put in. 
Probably by our present standards, we would have

04:15.819 --> 04:21.067
considered it being unsanitary and a crowded 
situation. But for those days, it was simply

04:21.107 --> 04:24.972
normal, and the people were just delighted to be 
leaving their countries, not only from Poland,

04:25.340 --> 04:30.908
but from most of the Eastern European countries. 
Food was served in a large pot. You had a community

04:36.295 --> 04:38.658
dish, community label. My father still tells me 
that there were the two Russians, somewhere from

04:38.738 --> 04:44.346
deep inside of Russia. And he said they were 
pleasant men, but obviously untutored and

04:44.667 --> 04:48.171
uncultured. The choice piece of food This stew 
that they would invariably bring was the meat with

04:52.559 --> 04:57.528
the fat on it. And when they would bring the pot 
over, one of these Russians would walk over, roll

04:57.548 --> 05:12.997
up his sleeve, and just shove his hand into this hot 
boiling mess just to get out this slimy piece of fat

04:57.548 --> 05:12.997
food and proceed to eat it, much to the disgust of 
all of the other passengers. And they finally

05:13.098 --> 05:15.462
complained and got the captain down. The captain 
came down, listened to their complaints, and then

05:16.488 --> 05:26.383
lined up the two Russians against the wall and told 
them that if he should ever hear of this again, he

05:16.488 --> 05:26.383
would personally have them thrown overboard. And 
so that ended that particular incident. He came

05:29.708 --> 05:36.959
and landed at Ellis Island, which was at that time 
the major disembarkation point for most of the

05:29.708 --> 05:36.959
immigrants. And when I asked him what it is that 
they checked on, he said really only two things,

05:37.861 --> 05:44.571
eyes and syphilis. If you could see and a medical 
check showed that you didn't have syphilis, that

05:45.344 --> 05:49.910
was it. And so he passed through Ellis Island in 
about five minutes, was released, and from that

05:50.751 --> 05:57.200
point on he was on his own. It was literally the new 
country. He worked at a variety of jobs.

06:05.050 --> 06:11.318
By the time my mother met him, he had a little store 
which sold musical goods. I wouldn't say it was a

06:13.289 --> 06:18.055
terribly successful one, but my father was a 
bachelor for a number of years. In fact, he didn't

06:18.275 --> 06:20.818
get married until he was about 40 or 41. And for his 
purposes, it was sufficient to keep body and soul

06:20.999 --> 06:25.464
together. And so that was what his business was. My 
mother got a hold of him, and she looked at it and

06:31.311 --> 06:38.861
realized that the music business was not the kind 
of thing you could depend on to raise a family. And

06:39.782 --> 06:42.165
so she started to introduce furniture. and the 
store finally became known as Grove Music and

06:43.445 --> 06:58.045
Furniture Company, which sounds very 
prestigious, but in reality was a small

06:43.445 --> 06:58.045
rinky-dink store that catered primarily to the 
immigrant groups in downtown Jersey City. The

06:58.065 --> 07:04.854
music portion was the concession my mother had to 
make to my father, who still had this great love for

06:58.065 --> 07:04.854
music. He himself played an accordion. Your 
mother was already living

07:11.643 --> 07:14.007
them had come from Poland to this country. And so my 
mother and my father were married. My mother's

07:18.815 --> 07:20.578
background is quite different. She came from a 
little town called Przemysl, which is right on the

07:20.618 --> 07:37.566
P-R-Z-E-M-Y-S-L.

07:20.618 --> 07:37.566
And the last L is really a Polish L, which is an L with 
a little diagonal out through it, which gives it a

07:20.618 --> 07:37.566
different accent mark. In reality, the town was 
called Shenyava, which is sort of the outskirts of

07:38.373 --> 07:42.859
Kremish. Shenyava would be S-I-E-N-I-A-W-A.

07:52.190 --> 08:02.423
And my mother and her aunt was also, or her sister 
was here in this country, still talk about the time

07:52.190 --> 08:02.423
before the First World War, that when winter would 
come, And the River Son, which is the river that

08:02.909 --> 08:09.056
separated the Polish border from the Russian 
border, would freeze over. S-A-N.

08:12.480 --> 08:19.027
The wolves would come down from the Russian 
forests foraging for food, and they would come

08:12.480 --> 08:19.027
into the villages. And it wasn't unusual in those 
days to open up the window of the cottage, and by

08:19.928 --> 08:30.840
window it means a shuttered board because there 
were no glass panes, and find yourself looking

08:19.928 --> 08:30.840
face to face with a Russian timber wolf. And one of 
the stories that comes as a result of that, my wife

08:32.879 --> 08:44.412
happened to write up in a children's magazine, it 
was the story about my grandfather played the

08:32.879 --> 08:44.412
fiddle for the wolves. And it literally was true. 
My grandfather, like most of the people in that

08:47.716 --> 08:54.464
part of the country, would play some musical 
instrument. It was their form of recreation. And

08:56.907 --> 08:59.089
he would play at various wedding feasts. And they 
would go from town to town. The town perhaps were

09:02.238 --> 09:07.826
not more than one or two miles apart, or one 
kilometer to two kilometers. But the only

09:08.487 --> 09:12.833
transportation you had was your own feet. And this 
one winter, my grandfather had played at this one

09:12.853 --> 09:17.720
wedding in this one town and was coming back. And he 
played the bull fiddle. And as he was walking in the

09:22.390 --> 09:29.581
snow, he looked up at the ridge and he suddenly 
realized there were three or four wolves on that

09:22.390 --> 09:29.581
ridge tracking him. This had been a particularly 
bitter, cold winter. And under such

09:33.386 --> 09:38.333
circumstances, the wolves were known to attack 
people. Normally, the wolf would try to shy away

09:38.433 --> 09:44.723
from people and attacks on people, per se, were 
fairly rare. But nevertheless, people were aware

09:45.644 --> 09:51.132
that under extreme provocation of hunger, a wolf 
would come down. And my grandfather realized that

09:52.512 --> 09:57.017
with the heavy clothing he had, there was no chance 
to outrun it. And the wolves apparently were there

09:57.938 --> 10:02.984
for some rather gruesome business. They were 
looking for food, and he happened to be the prime

10:03.064 --> 10:06.087
source. So he didn't know what to do. And by this 
time, the wolves started to come down and circle

10:07.969 --> 10:10.532
him. They got an idea, and he took out the bass 
fiddle. And as the wolf came within about 30 to 40

10:14.376 --> 10:20.663
yards of him, he took the bow and strung it across 
the fiddle. and then stop the wolves in their track

10:21.284 --> 10:26.751
because they just weren't aware what the sound 
could be. But they'd come, stop and come back and

10:27.833 --> 10:32.439
start approaching him again and again. He would 
take the bow and draw it against the fiddle and did

10:32.519 --> 10:40.269
this a number of times until we so panicked the 
wolves that they ran away. And so from that time on,

10:40.309 --> 10:46.397
he was known as the man who played the fiddle for the 
wolves. But my mother stayed on in Poland. Unlike

10:49.660 --> 10:52.603
my father, she didn't leave before the First World 
War. She stayed in this little village during the

10:52.703 --> 10:55.827
war itself. And Przemysl was the jumping-off 
place in both wars for the German attack on Russia.

11:05.097 --> 11:10.683
And so in this little village, she watched the 
Austrian army make its preparations for the

11:05.097 --> 11:10.683
invasion of Russia. The troops were garrisoned in 
the town. And in those days, you still had bayonet

11:14.930 --> 11:19.014
chargers and cavalry chargers. And so they met the 
Russians. And just outside of the town, there was

11:22.818 --> 11:32.569
some sort of a gory battle scene.

11:32.589 --> 11:36.593
After the battle was over, the dead and the dying 
would lie along the field. And in Poland, I would

11:37.534 --> 11:39.416
assume it's a raven. It's a blackbird. It would 
come down, being a scavenger bird, and peck. at the

11:45.490 --> 11:49.494
cadavers, but worst of all, would peck at the eyes. 
And for a wounded man who couldn't bring his hand up

11:50.735 --> 11:56.941
to defend his face, it would mean that he faced 
blindness. And so the Austrian army rounded up all

11:58.343 --> 12:15.480
of the children in the two villages, including my 
mother's, gave them long sticks, marched them out

11:58.343 --> 12:15.480
into the battlefield, and had them go along among 
the wounded and the dead to beat away these ravens,

11:58.343 --> 12:15.480
lest they peck out the eyes of the living. That had a 
very lasting impression on my mother. My mother

12:20.628 --> 12:27.382
from that point on became a pacifist, almost a 
militant pacifist. She watched the war and that

12:27.402 --> 12:37.823
was not the end of it because, of course, the 
Austrians invaded Russia and did beat the

12:27.402 --> 12:37.823
Germans, and did beat the Russians. The Russians 
in turn regrouped, came back and proceeded to take

12:38.343 --> 12:48.414
advantage of the Austrians and in fact had beaten 
them. And then I believe it's under Hindenburg,

12:49.215 --> 12:53.961
not even sure if that's him or not. At any rate, the 
Prussians came in and of course they now proceeded

12:54.541 --> 13:00.368
to come and beat the Russians again. So you had 
three armies marching through this one little

13:02.292 --> 13:05.818
town. First the Austrians, then the Russians, and 
then the Russians and the Austrians. In each case

13:11.686 --> 13:17.996
there were battles, in each case there was the gory 
mutilation of man. And this left quite an effect on

13:19.398 --> 13:21.361
my mother. She remembers once a, I guess it was an 
Austrian captain who was Well, he wasn't kept. He

13:31.845 --> 13:33.848
actually took over, commandeered their home. And 
at the supper meal, he brought in food from the

13:35.090 --> 13:52.973
garrison to feed my mother's family and began to 
weep and told my mother's family how they reminded

13:35.090 --> 13:52.973
him of his own family and also predicted his own 
death, which in fact did occur the following day.

13:56.838 --> 13:59.582
Of course, when peace came, Poland was created. 
And my mother did not want to stay in this small

14:01.739 --> 14:06.367
town. She knew she had more abilities than the town 
possibly could give her. Yet in those days, it was

14:11.415 --> 14:14.781
difficult for a peasant to get any education. And 
so she decided that the only way she could get

14:15.903 --> 14:23.095
gymnasium, which is the same as our schools here, 
is to become a nun. And so she joined the nunnery.

14:26.005 --> 14:53.464
and she had a rather idealistic view of the church 
at that time thinking that once you got in to a

14:26.005 --> 14:53.464
nunnery that regardless of your state of birth 
that if you had ability you would be able to do

14:26.005 --> 14:53.464
things and rise to whatever position you aspire to 
and what she found was that again politics existed

14:26.005 --> 14:53.464
even within the church she went there she did go to 
school but she also found out that the Daughters of

14:54.153 --> 14:56.876
the wealthy became the teachers. The daughters of 
the peasants became the scully maids. And so about

15:01.020 --> 15:07.387
the time it came for her to take a final vow, she 
decided that this was no great advantage to her.

15:08.267 --> 15:12.632
And so she left the convent and took off to Warsaw to 
become a seamstress.

15:15.074 --> 15:21.561
And she was semi-adopted by a family in Warsaw, 
wife of a banker. although she was officially the

15:21.980 --> 15:24.824
seamstress for the woman. The woman, who was 
childless, tended to look at my mother as being

15:24.844 --> 15:31.353
sort of a type of daughter. She was treated very 
well. And then about this time, the Polish

15:34.077 --> 15:38.944
Revolution takes place. Well, Piłsudski comes 
into power. P-I, again, this L, S-U-D-S-K-I.

15:48.918 --> 15:51.261
I think it was Beck. at that time was the president 
of Poland. Piłsudski was a socialist, and they,

15:54.926 --> 16:15.074
Piłsudski was accused of high crimes against the 
government, but Piłsudski also was a hero of the

15:54.926 --> 16:15.074
newly created state of Poland in that he was able to 
stop the Trotskyites at the gates of Warsaw, and so

15:54.926 --> 16:15.074
he had a tremendous allegiance from the army. 
Well, Piłsudski was tried by the government for

16:16.155 --> 16:21.282
treason, and he was slated to be shot at 3 o'clock on 
a Friday afternoon. The place where he was going to

16:27.656 --> 16:35.988
be executed was not that far from where my mother's 
apartment was, or really the banker's wife's

16:27.656 --> 16:35.988
apartment. This was on Alea...

16:40.815 --> 16:46.923
I believe it may be called now Alea Piłsudskiego, 
but I'm not quite sure what the original name was.

16:47.003 --> 16:50.188
At any rate, it was one of the fashionable streets 
in Warsaw. By 11 o'clock that morning, the train

16:51.822 --> 17:01.397
started to come in from the outskirts, bringing in 
the Polish troops, the people who were loyal to

16:51.822 --> 17:01.397
Piłsudski. In other words, a coup d'etat was in the 
making. And finally, it erupted into battle. And

17:08.629 --> 17:12.836
part of the battle was fought outside of this 
apartment where my mother was living. And she was

17:13.136 --> 17:14.939
able to look down at the square. And the government 
trying to stymie the military takeover had thrown

17:17.911 --> 17:46.332
in cadets from the military academy to fight 
against the regulars and it was slaughter and she

17:17.911 --> 17:46.332
happened again to witness this bloodbath outside 
of her window and again a sort of cynicism came

17:17.911 --> 17:46.332
through again because she watched the priests go 
among the wounded and for a pole who almost

17:17.911 --> 17:46.332
invariably is a catholic The communion rites, the 
last rites, are extremely, extremely important.

17:51.135 --> 17:54.201
And she said she remembers watching the priest 
going among the dying. And in many cases, you

17:55.463 --> 18:01.876
couldn't distinguish who was the soldier from the 
field, who was the cadet. Both wore the same

18:01.956 --> 18:04.081
uniforms. And he would say in Polish, ,, which 
means left or right. Piłsudski was considered the

18:10.021 --> 18:11.623
leftist. The rightist was the government. And if 
you happen to say, , the police would deny you the

18:14.427 --> 18:19.354
last rights. Well, Piłsudski obviously wins. And 
the government is overthrown. Piłsudski becomes

18:27.425 --> 18:28.706
the dictator. And it's by this time my mother is so 
disillusioned and so disgusted with the

18:28.726 --> 18:37.378
bloodbaths, the social intrigue, that she leaves 
for this country. And she said, when she got on the

18:38.742 --> 18:43.249
boat, I forgot where she left from, perhaps . She 
said, unlike most of the other people who were

18:43.709 --> 18:49.217
looking back, crying, she just turned her back on 
Poland. She said, that was the end. There was

18:50.660 --> 18:51.641
nothing there. She came to this country. She 
landed in Jersey City. And she proceeded to work in

18:55.286 --> 18:58.571
a shirt factory. This is part-time work. And 
apparently, training that she had received in

18:59.793 --> 19:05.121
Warsaw as a seamstress, was to her advantage 
because she stopped to make good money. Well, of

19:09.933 --> 19:13.718
course, she landed again in this downtown Polish 
community. This is true of most of the immigrants.

19:15.721 --> 19:22.010
There was a certain comfort in that you knew the 
language and the culture, and the people tended to

19:15.721 --> 19:22.010
look after each other. Did your mother learn 
English? Yes, in a sense. Her English now, she'll

19:26.677 --> 19:30.883
say, is fairly good, but it's almost not 
understandable. Nevertheless, she

19:31.084 --> 19:33.387
communicates very, very well. a combination of 
hand gestures, a great deal of screaming, and a

19:33.856 --> 19:39.302
great deal of coquettishness. Her English was 
never as good as my father's. My father was fairly

19:43.566 --> 20:02.226
good in English, but so very often when he would use 
English, although you would get the content of the

19:43.566 --> 20:02.226
message, you wouldn't get the content of the 
meaning because so often when you translate from

19:43.566 --> 20:02.226
another language, you tend to just give the words 
rather than to be able to express yourself.

20:05.058 --> 20:06.080
When do you want me to stop? Is there any reason why 
your mother and father happened to be in Jersey

20:06.480 --> 20:11.648
City, or was it just happening that way? Well, it 
happened that way because remember, Jersey City

20:11.668 --> 20:16.616
is two and a half minutes away from New York City. 
And in the New York City, Jersey City, Hoboken

20:17.938 --> 20:26.671
area, this was just an actual residing place for 
people who got off the boat. As a six-year-old, did

20:26.691 --> 20:30.998
you have difficulty learning English, or did it 
come pretty easy? Do you know I can't even

20:31.383 --> 20:32.725
remember? Because the parochial school I had gone 
to was bilingual. I studied Polish history,

20:37.373 --> 20:44.004
American history, Polish grammar, American 
grammar, English grammar. So it was completely

20:44.525 --> 20:46.248
bilingual. The nuns who taught were also 
bilingual. that I'm aware of, plus the fact that on

20:50.823 --> 20:54.308
the streets you spoke English. In those days, to 
have an accent or to speak another language meant

20:55.350 --> 21:02.180
that you were immediately labeled a greenhorn. 
And so there was peer pressure to try to get rid of

21:02.901 --> 21:10.833
the vestiges of the other language, the other 
culture. And for that reason, many people of my age

21:10.853 --> 21:17.202
who are first generation, whether they're 
Polish, Italian, or what have you, tend to have

21:17.603 --> 21:22.871
forgotten their language because the peer 
pressure tended to try to make you forget it. At

21:23.151 --> 21:27.658
home, even though your parents would speak in one 
language, you would proceed to answer them in

21:23.151 --> 21:27.658
English. Do you speak Polish now on a regular 
basis? Yes, every time I speak with my mother. Plus

21:32.024 --> 21:37.252
the fact that I've tried to keep up with it at any 
chance that I'd have, I tried to practice with it.

21:37.272 --> 21:44.843
Let me get your idea on how you as a young boy were 
affected by the Depression, also how your family

21:37.272 --> 21:44.843
was affected. I think, physically, I wasn't 
affected in the sense that I was not hungry and I was

21:46.223 --> 21:52.252
not without clothes. Of course, I was born in 1930, 
which means at the peak of the Depression, this is

21:52.813 --> 21:58.902
my growing up period of time. I always had food when 
I wanted it, and I had clothes when I wanted it. It

22:05.011 --> 22:09.377
wasn't by any means the best of clothes or anything 
of this sort. But again, if you're born into it, and

22:13.004 --> 22:19.212
everybody else is in the same circumstance, 
you're not aware that you're either

22:13.004 --> 22:19.212
discriminated or you're poverty-stricken. And 
this was probably true also of the culture. I'm

22:22.096 --> 22:27.302
sure by present standards now we would say we were 
culturally deprived, but no one realized it. You

22:27.522 --> 22:30.586
know, this was the normal state of being. Our 
recreational area were the streets of the city and

22:30.727 --> 22:35.012
the docks of Jersey City. And in many ways, they 
were far more exciting than anything anyone could

22:35.498 --> 22:39.764
ever construct now. The general rule of play was 
you left the house at 8 o'clock in the morning, and

22:40.525 --> 22:53.563
you went out and played with your playmates or did 
whatever you want, and you came back at 10 o'clock

22:40.525 --> 22:53.563
at night. The only rule was that don't have the 
policeman bring you home, which meant that you

22:54.705 --> 23:04.999
learned to cope with life individually, by 
yourself, at a much earlier age. than perhaps,

23:05.637 --> 23:09.142
say, a child growing up in a suburban area. You got 
your knocks, you came back with your cuts, you got

23:10.524 --> 23:19.999
into your tussles with your peer groups and alien 
peer groups, but you learned to accommodate very

23:10.524 --> 23:19.999
quickly. You developed your own game, stickball, 
which is uniquely a city game. It's a thing that

23:25.407 --> 23:30.835
developed in people trying to have recreation 
within close confines. We played football of a

23:31.102 --> 23:36.330
type that nobody here has ever seen because nobody 
could afford a football. In fact, I didn't see a

23:36.410 --> 23:40.256
football, a real football, until I was about 15 
years old. A football was a bunch of newspapers

23:40.957 --> 23:45.523
wrapped around tight with an elastic band around 
it. And I was a superb passer with one of those until

23:46.144 --> 23:51.072
they gave me a real football and I found I couldn't 
handle the thing. What about brothers and

23:53.295 --> 23:54.557
sisters? I have none.

23:59.587 --> 24:03.714
Would you say again how you got to Rensselaer Tech? 
Rensselaer Polytech? By the time I was about a

24:06.639 --> 24:09.585
junior in high school, I knew what I wanted. I 
wanted to become an engineer for a number of

24:09.605 --> 24:12.490
reasons. For one thing, engineering didn't 
require the background of the so-called cultural

24:12.530 --> 24:21.105
topics. literature, great literature that you 
normally think of as a child having at home was not

24:21.676 --> 24:28.562
available in our house or anybody else's homes. 
Yet I had an ability with mathematics and I loved

24:29.083 --> 24:32.306
abstractions. And about this time I decided I 
wanted to go into an engineering college and so I

24:33.988 --> 24:47.640
looked around and the traditional schools in that 
area would have been Rutgers, NYU, New York

24:33.988 --> 24:47.640
University, CCNY, although that was not 
available to me. That was only available for New

24:49.840 --> 24:58.468
York City residents, Brooklyn Polytech, and of 
course I'd heard about Rensselaer, didn't know

24:49.840 --> 24:58.468
much about it. I did want one thing, I wanted to get 
away from home. I just felt, you know, the confines

25:01.912 --> 25:08.078
of Jersey City were beginning to get to me. I wanted 
to get away from that area. There wasn't that much

25:12.102 --> 25:18.328
there, plus the fact that I watched the poverty, 
which I began now to perceive, And I wanted to break

25:19.490 --> 25:23.797
out of the mold of Jersey City. The normal mold for 
me, or for most of the people in the downtown area,

25:24.558 --> 25:40.403
would have been to finish high school, for those 
who were fortunate, most often not quit at 16, and

25:24.558 --> 25:40.403
go to work on the docks, or go to work in the railroad 
yard, or go to work in the slaughterhouses. And it

25:41.605 --> 25:47.033
was like a great pit staring in front of me, and I 
wanted to avoid it as much as possible. And you

25:47.587 --> 25:51.692
can't appreciate what it means until you've been 
there. It's like a nightmare, a constant

25:52.312 --> 25:58.539
recurring nightmare, somebody saying, well, 
you're doing good, but wait, we're going to get

25:52.312 --> 25:58.539
you. You're coming back. And I didn't know this. I 
did not want that kind of an existence. It's as

26:05.467 --> 26:11.333
though somebody were just chasing after me, and I 
just had to run and run and run and do everything I

26:05.467 --> 26:11.333
could to get away from it. And Rensselaer seemed to 
have been the furthest away of all the schools that

26:12.074 --> 26:17.340
I was aware of when I applied. not hoping or didn't 
even think that they might take me, but I thought

26:18.282 --> 26:27.272
nothing could be lost by applying, and when I 
applied, lo and behold, they accepted me. For what

26:27.292 --> 26:28.893
reasons, I have no idea. Do you remember how the 
ward bosses affected the lives of the

26:28.913 --> 26:37.182
newly-aroused immigrants? Oh, yeah. The 
greatest system that we've ever had, in spite of

26:37.643 --> 26:41.607
what you hear about. You know, we talk now about 
modern society being uncommunicative and modern

26:42.700 --> 26:50.167
leaders being removed from society. Hague's 
machine, and for that matter the machines in all of

26:51.088 --> 27:03.619
the cities, were as corrupt as they can be in that 
people did take money, but they never took money

26:51.088 --> 27:03.619
away from the mouths of the people, especially 
from the poor. And the ward, of course, existed not

27:04.080 --> 27:08.304
because of the wealthy or the middle class. It 
existed because the immigrants or the poor. Once

27:13.345 --> 27:22.674
you established yourself as a Democrat, because 
there were no Republicans in Jersey City, at least

27:13.345 --> 27:22.674
I never was aware of any, you never had to worry 
about food. If you were in dire need, in

27:22.734 --> 27:29.842
starvation, the ward boss would be the one who 
would take care of you. He would make sure that

27:29.882 --> 27:35.167
either companies or perhaps the city would 
provide food for you. Where there was a

27:35.948 --> 27:42.154
possibility of a job, even though it was makeshift 
work, you'd have some money coming in. And it was a

27:42.995 --> 27:45.579
very humane type of existence. That is, they 
literally looked after their own because the ward

27:45.639 --> 27:51.728
bosses themselves were nothing more than just 
part of the people. And the ward boss lived right

27:52.529 --> 27:55.454
there among the people. He was one of you. He 
probably lived three or four more houses down in a

27:56.936 --> 28:02.084
cold water flat, which is where most of us lived. 
And so if you had a problem, you went to him, and he

28:03.185 --> 28:07.652
knew exactly what it was that you were talking 
about. He, in turn, would have the influence then

28:08.341 --> 28:11.505
into City Hall. And City Hall depended on its votes 
from the poor. Now, the bad part about it is, if you

28:18.815 --> 28:38.280
happen to be a free spirit and suddenly started to 
mouth off and said, I'm going to clean up the

28:18.815 --> 28:38.280
government, or I hereby claim myself as a 
Republican, or some other nonsensical thing that

28:18.815 --> 28:38.280
a luxury that is really limited to the middle 
class, you found yourself on a very brutal end of

28:39.442 --> 28:41.864
the stick. Because as charitable as they could be, 
they would not brook any rebellion. They would

28:51.032 --> 28:53.615
come down on you pretty hard. And by that I mean 
physically. The cops would visit you and proceed

28:56.397 --> 28:59.720
to work you over. And it wasn't unusual for people 
to disappear. But by and large, most people didn't

29:03.103 --> 29:05.205
do that. Most people weren't. Most people, the 
politics part, was the last thing away from their

29:09.293 --> 29:11.296
mind. The important thing was survival and how to 
keep the family together. This continued through

29:15.943 --> 29:17.305
the 30s? This continued right into the 40s, and in 
fact, the last vestige of it was Mayor Daley. Mayor

29:22.874 --> 29:26.018
Daley was the last of the great city bosses. He 
lived right among the people. He understood the

29:28.182 --> 29:29.243
people. The problem was that he may have stayed on 
perhaps one generation too late because once the

29:30.245 --> 29:38.457
first generation grew up, second-generation 
started to move outside of the city. It started now

29:42.561 --> 29:43.923
to expand. After the Second World War, suburbs 
started to come into being. The working man became

29:47.807 --> 29:55.235
a middle-class citizen and could afford things, 
which meant the concentration of people

29:47.807 --> 29:55.235
diminished. And when that happened, at least that 
would have been one of the reasons that caused the

29:56.076 --> 30:01.642
demise of the city force. But if you were to ask, how 
do I judge it? Was it a successful political

30:05.086 --> 30:07.048
system? I would say superbly. It satisfied the 
demands and the needs of the people at the time they

30:08.963 --> 30:14.812
most needed it. And during the Depression, it was a 
particularly good system. In downtown Jersey

30:18.798 --> 30:27.611
City, people would have starved had it not been for 
the ward bosses and for the pressure that they

30:18.798 --> 30:27.611
would put on the industries in the city. Then you 
think the ward bosses had more of an effect on

30:27.631 --> 30:34.161
stabilizing the Jersey City area than did the New 
Deal programs? Well, yes, I do. The New Deal

30:36.349 --> 30:39.253
program was an overview program. The New Deal 
program would have meant nothing at all to anybody

30:39.293 --> 30:45.040
unless it was implemented. The ward bosses 
perhaps were the most important single item. The

30:49.927 --> 30:53.992
New Deal helped give the whole country a different 
direction. But if the New Deal had not come in, say

30:55.774 --> 31:00.300
Roosevelt had not won, The people in the cities 
would have still survived because you still had

31:01.040 --> 31:07.489
your big city bosses and you still had your ward 
system. And your ward system did exist during

31:07.509 --> 31:12.697
Republican as well as Democratic 
administrations. It would have been a little bit

31:12.737 --> 31:16.923
harder, but it would have still continued on. What 
the New Deal did is, of course, create WPA. And WPA

31:20.598 --> 31:26.666
in turn was administered through the city and 
finally ultimately dispensed by the ward bosses.

31:26.686 --> 31:33.416
So in my view, the ward system was perhaps the 
single most important stabilizing element for

31:26.686 --> 31:33.416
the immigrants in this country. Do you have any 
indication how politics of Jersey City has

31:34.457 --> 31:40.706
changed since you were there in the 30s as a boy? 
Yeah. For one thing, you have now two new ethnic

31:41.467 --> 31:44.491
groups. You have the Puerto Ricans and you have the 
Negroes. The downtown area is almost totally

31:50.686 --> 31:52.808
replaced by those. There are a few small pockets of 
either Polish or Italian ethnic areas. But it's

31:59.413 --> 32:00.314
changed. A number of things have come into being. 
For one thing, at least for the whites, there's a

32:02.856 --> 32:09.042
middle class basis which didn't exist in the 30s.

32:13.846 --> 32:20.271
The cohesiveness of the people perhaps has also 
changed now than it was in the 30s and in the 40s.

32:20.538 --> 32:30.032
When you didn't have transportation, mass 
transportation, when you didn't have all of the

32:20.538 --> 32:30.032
possibilities for recreation, people tended to 
live in their own immediate environments. The

32:30.893 --> 32:41.930
streets and the city block was not only a place to 
sleep or walk, it was also a place to play, it was a

32:30.893 --> 32:41.930
place of culture. And you had a whole cultural 
dimension known as the inner city block. which in

32:49.462 --> 32:56.551
many cases still exists now, but it exists among 
the Negroes and the Puerto Ricans. And to really

32:56.732 --> 33:00.096
see it would mean that you would have to go there and 
understand it. Now within the, say, the Negro

33:01.478 --> 33:06.244
community, you find a great deal of violence 
associated with it. Violence in the sense of guns

33:06.925 --> 33:09.889
and knives and things of this sort. There was 
violence in the sense that there would be an

33:11.271 --> 33:17.359
occasional fight, fist fight, and at worst a pool 
cue. but I cannot remember violence of the nature

33:18.352 --> 33:21.576
that you see here. And of course, many 
sociologists have said that it's because of the

33:22.437 --> 33:29.527
background of the people, the cultural 
background of the people. I'm not sure I buy that,

33:29.927 --> 33:38.238
quite frankly, because again, when you talk with a 
peasant, you're not talking with an aristocratic

33:29.927 --> 33:38.238
individual who could look back at family. But in 
contrast to the minority now, the elements that

33:39.300 --> 33:46.890
you see now, with the exception of the Spanish, 
There was a cohesiveness of family, which the

33:47.174 --> 33:53.304
Negro is now just beginning to establish. So I'm 
not quite sure how you'd put that in perspective.

33:57.911 --> 33:58.813
There are differences. Now, Jersey City is 
different now. Has there been any change in the

34:01.097 --> 34:05.864
second generation of immigrants? Has there been 
any movement away from the Democratic Party by

34:05.884 --> 34:10.993
that group compared to their fathers and mothers? 
Yeah, there has been. As you get into the middle

34:12.908 --> 34:20.981
class syndrome, you find that you begin objecting 
to the amount of money taken out of your paycheck.

34:21.081 --> 34:25.287
You suddenly begin enjoying the luxuries of life, 
and you begin objecting to have to share them. And

34:25.808 --> 34:37.326
you find that you more and more tend to lean toward a 
Republican view, which means keep government off

34:25.808 --> 34:37.326
my back, rather than a Democratic one, which is 
basically get government in because it's a great

34:25.808 --> 34:37.326
help. So there has been that movement. Now, how 
much, I don't know. Tell us about your years at

34:42.305 --> 34:47.430
Rensselaer. There's not really much to say. You 
entered in what, 1941? I'm 48. I graduated in 52. I

34:55.318 --> 35:06.769
was a very serious student and very much aware that 
in my family this was the first time that anybody

34:55.318 --> 35:06.769
has ever gone through high school, let alone go to 
college. And I was aware of both the

35:06.789 --> 35:11.333
responsibility as well as the fears My father was 
able to scrape enough money to put me through. The

35:14.626 --> 35:21.192
tuition at that time was $750 a year, which was a 
considerable amount of money. And so I tried to

35:21.212 --> 35:23.094
minimize costs. My clothes were all Army surplus. 
This was the post-war years where you could get

35:25.396 --> 35:30.641
fairly nice surplus clothes. The officer pink 
twills was the standard sports costume for most

35:31.362 --> 35:37.028
people on campuses in those days. Would you say 
that again? Pink twills. Spell that. P-I-N-K.

35:41.806 --> 35:43.969
T-W-I-L-L-S. Two words. Yeah, they're twills. 
They were gabardine trousers that officers would

35:45.671 --> 35:50.356
wear and that were sold in a surplus equipment. You 
got surplus jackets, surplus shirts, and so I

35:50.376 --> 35:53.720
lived that way. My food was very sparse. In fact, I 
think I lived on beans most of the time. I never went

36:00.749 --> 36:02.731
out on Saturday and Sunday. I was what you'd call a 
drudge. I worked and studied seven days a week and

36:04.433 --> 36:07.797
enjoyed it. For me, it was as though I entered into a 
new land, and there was just a tremendous sense of

36:08.215 --> 36:15.626
excitement, of learning. And so I spent four years 
without really having much of a social life, other

36:15.646 --> 36:21.755
than working and working and working away. But I 
graduated with honors, and I never regret those

36:22.537 --> 36:26.442
four years. They were not what you'd call a 
traditional high school or college experience,

36:27.624 --> 36:36.197
because I didn't go out on dates, didn't go out to 
fraternities, even though they did exist. I had

36:37.139 --> 36:40.423
very few friends, pretty much people the same as I. 
And most of all, enjoyed what I was doing, enjoyed

36:40.463 --> 36:49.114
just studying, enjoyed just expanding my mind and 
standing in awe of the opportunity that was given

36:40.463 --> 36:49.114
to me. Okay, what happened in 52 when you 
completed? Well, then I graduated and I went to

36:52.859 --> 36:55.723
Curtis Wright Corporation. I worked in the... 
Okay, in St. Louis? No, Caldwell, New Jersey.

36:59.448 --> 37:00.309
Caldwell, New Jersey. Yeah, they had a propeller 
division there. And I worked there for two years.

37:06.637 --> 37:09.840
And, of course, this was now getting on toward the 
tail end of the Korean War. And I remember I

37:12.002 --> 37:16.246
reported to the draft board, and they said, well, 
you're working for an essential industry. I said,

37:16.967 --> 37:17.568
fine. And then they came around and they drafted 
me, and that's perhaps not quite true. In reality,

37:23.613 --> 37:29.019
about 54, I went to the draft board, and I said, will 
you draft me? They said, yes, whether you want to

37:29.039 --> 37:30.520
go. I told them, well, how about spring? It seems a 
nice time. I worked at Curtis Wright. And of

37:37.020 --> 37:40.584
course, Curtis Wright was a great employer of 
Rensselaer students. And many of the people

37:41.825 --> 37:49.873
working in this small office, the same as the 
machine design office, were people that had

37:41.825 --> 37:49.873
preceded me by a year or so. And I knew were honor 
students of themselves. And I watched what they

37:52.416 --> 37:53.577
were doing. And what struck me is that here were 
people highly motivated in college, very

37:54.758 --> 38:02.226
capable, who did nothing more than live for the 
weekend. They would talk about what they did last

38:03.033 --> 38:05.116
weekend. They would talk about what they were 
going to do the following weekend. Would come in at

38:08.320 --> 38:11.565
8 o'clock and would leave promptly at 5 o'clock. 
And that was not what, in my mind, I had studied for.

38:18.995 --> 38:21.599
I didn't want an 8 to 5 job. It had to be more than 
that. It had to be a consuming passion. Perhaps at

38:25.485 --> 38:28.188
that age I still thought of those terms. Perhaps I 
still do. I began to become very disillusioned

38:31.737 --> 38:40.929
with the practice of engineering as I had seen it at 
Curtis Wright, and I decided I need to get away and

38:31.737 --> 38:40.929
see, is this really what I want to do? And so when I 
asked them to draft me, it was, in a sense, my escape

38:42.651 --> 38:46.876
route. It was a legitimate way of leaving, doing 
something that I would never again do in my life,

38:46.896 --> 38:56.969
playing soldier, but most of all, giving me the 
time to think what I wanted to do. And so I was

38:58.430 --> 38:59.652
drafted. On May the 3rd, 1954, I went to Fort Dix, 
did my basic, then I went to Fort Huachuca, and then

39:00.357 --> 39:08.048
finally to Gila Bend. Spell it, Fort Huachuca. 
H-U-A-C-H-U-K-A. My father never could

39:14.197 --> 39:15.359
pronounce it. He always called it Fort Hoochie 
Coochie. Located in where? It's located in

39:18.503 --> 39:22.830
Arizona, south. In fact, I think it's a town of its 
own now. It's located around, well, south of

39:26.415 --> 39:30.060
Tombstone. and I'd leave west of Douglas. How long 
were you in the Army? Two years. You spent the whole

39:37.530 --> 39:40.955
time in Arizona? Yeah. In 1956 you got out. What did 
you do then? I went to graduate school at Ohio

39:43.938 --> 39:46.361
State. The original idea was... Columbus? I got 
out a little earlier. I got out, I think, 60 days

39:52.709 --> 39:57.735
earlier than two years because the Army at that 
time had a policy that you could get out up to ninety

39:59.318 --> 40:08.131
days early if you could show that a school had begun 
within that period of time or you had seasonal

39:59.318 --> 40:08.131
occupation. And after two years at Gila Bend I 
decided it's time now to leave. I got my act pretty

40:13.479 --> 40:15.182
much together. I know what I want to do. And I 
started to look at graduate schools and somebody

40:17.485 --> 40:26.659
mentioned Ohio State and Ohio State was under a 
quarter system which meant that they started

40:27.230 --> 40:29.253
their semester on March the 16th. So I applied for 
early leave, was granted it, and went to Columbus,

40:30.775 --> 40:37.884
Ohio, and did my master's. Having done my 
master's, finished it, I was offered an

40:39.426 --> 40:46.936
instructorship and asked to continue on for my 
doctorate. When did you complete the master's? In

40:48.779 --> 40:51.082
19, let's see, I got out at 56, 57. And then you 
worked at Ohio State? Right, as an instructor. I

40:56.047 --> 40:57.809
worked on my doctorate at the same time. When did 
you complete the doctorate? 62. You stayed there

41:00.332 --> 41:01.674
through that time? Yeah. At Ohio State? Yeah, from 
57 to 62. When did you marry? I married in 58. Where

41:06.179 --> 41:07.921
was your wife from? She was originally from 
Ridgeway, but she was a graduate student.

41:12.146 --> 41:12.987
Ridgeway where? Pennsylvania. She was a graduate 
student pursuing doctoral studies at Ohio State

41:14.429 --> 41:19.797
in the Department of History. In fact, when I was 
finishing up my master's, she had just finished

41:20.758 --> 41:25.384
her prelims for her PhD. We met and we married in 
1958, a year after we met, about a year and a half

41:26.927 --> 41:34.838
after we met. My wife was working on a 
dissertation. And after we married, she decided

41:38.863 --> 41:41.567
that no, Really, the dissertation was not what she 
was interested in. For one thing, it was a rather

41:46.033 --> 41:48.976
boring subject. As she now freely admits, had the 
subject been more exciting, she probably would

41:48.996 --> 41:54.160
have continued. But instead, since she did have a 
teaching certificate, she then went and taught in

41:54.180 --> 42:11.875
the public schools in Columbus, also taught at 
Ohio Wesleyan University, which is close to

41:54.180 --> 42:11.875
Columbus, and then worked as a secretary 
part-time jobs.

42:15.685 --> 42:21.014
Could you tell us why you chose mechanical 
engineering rather than another field of

42:15.685 --> 42:21.014
engineering? Well, I didn't choose mechanical 
engineering. My bachelor's was in aeronautical

42:23.739 --> 42:29.189
engineering, and my master's and my doctorate 
were in flight mechanics. Those were the areas

42:30.772 --> 42:32.214
that I enjoyed. When I came to A&M, there was no 
flight mechanics department. There was a program

42:36.425 --> 42:42.494
called M&M, Mechanics and Materials, or at that 
time SM, Structural Mechanics. And I came to the

42:43.415 --> 42:48.202
Mechanical Engineering Department because it 
was the closest thing to my interest. In 1962, you

42:49.644 --> 42:51.848
completed your doctorate. What did you do then? I 
stayed on at Ohio State for that year as an

42:53.350 --> 42:56.935
assistant professor. I was tenured, still in 
applied mechanics, where I did, in fact, the same

42:57.936 --> 43:03.765
department I did my graduate work in. I was tenured 
by that time because the rank of instructor, which

43:04.252 --> 43:11.182
I held for five years, was a tenure-track 
position. And after four years, you were granted

43:12.304 --> 43:14.587
tenure. So I had tenure and an assistant 
professorship. But I decided that staying on at

43:18.072 --> 43:25.202
the institution where you got your degree was not 
the best policy. And so we then proceeded to look at

43:25.222 --> 43:29.489
universities throughout the country. And like 
most people, sent out something like 75 letters

43:34.508 --> 43:36.292
and received a number of responses. And A&M was one 
of them. And we looked at what A&M had, what it

43:39.778 --> 43:46.251
offered, and I decided I wanted to come to A&M. So 
you came here in 63? 63, right. You've been here

43:50.259 --> 43:51.441
ever since. Right. As a professor, I came in as an 
associate professor. I became a full professor in

43:57.448 --> 44:00.771
67 and continued on. And you've been involved in 
teaching and research. Right. You haven't held

44:03.694 --> 44:05.336
administrative posts? No.

44:09.880 --> 44:17.708
Did you find that when you came to Texas A&M that you 
were discriminated against by your northern

44:09.880 --> 44:17.708
background? No, I got the usual jokes. And in fact, 
the very first one that I came In fact, the first

44:24.627 --> 44:27.569
year we came, they had two snows at College 
Station. And I remember they were telling me about

44:28.771 --> 44:31.213
a Blue Northern. I had never heard of this before. 
And finally, this was in about September. It was an

44:35.096 --> 44:37.218
unusually hot September, October. And when the 
Blue Northern came, it dropped the temperature

44:37.238 --> 44:42.082
from about 95 to about 89. And everybody said, now 
isn't it cool? And I looked at him, and I told him,

44:44.164 --> 44:47.787
the only other Blue Northern that you've ever seen 
was Grant. And he came marching in from Georgia.

44:50.229 --> 44:54.212
But I never had any problems because of the 
Northern background or the accent. What are some

44:54.833 --> 45:00.824
of the research projects that you've been 
involved in in the 18 years that you've been here?

45:00.844 --> 45:08.678
Well, there were the NASA projects and this was, at 
that time, the Manned Spacecraft Center, which is

45:00.844 --> 45:08.678
now Johnson Spacecraft Center. In the 60s, shell 
structures, which was the outer skin, was a

45:10.621 --> 45:16.572
critical element. And at that time, they were 
still trying to develop techniques by which to

45:17.682 --> 45:26.135
analyze these type of structures and assure 
against any failure. And so from about 63 to about

45:26.155 --> 45:41.580
71, I was directly working with the Manned 
Spacecraft Center, funded by them, to do work,

45:26.155 --> 45:41.580
both theoretical and practical, on developing 
ways of analyzing reinforced shell structures.

45:43.028 --> 45:47.055
About 69, the project Themis came into being. This 
was the idea of helping schools, just building

45:47.316 --> 45:53.667
research programs, develop competence. And this 
was funded by the Department of Defense. And A&M

45:56.693 --> 46:01.662
was one of the recipients of one of these grants. 
And I defined for them a program in the College of

46:02.131 --> 46:07.756
Engineering dealing with the optimization of 
reinforced shells. And that is, if you're going to

46:07.837 --> 46:17.086
reinforce it and put stiffeners, what is the most 
efficient way of doing it so you gain your strength

46:07.837 --> 46:17.086
at a minimum increase in weight? And that program 
then brought in industry.

46:22.251 --> 46:28.837
China, not Charles Ford, but up in the Fort Worth 
area, there's Charles Ford and there's Convair.

46:28.937 --> 46:29.978
General Dynamics, rather. The General Dynamics 
people were extremely interested in it because in

46:30.397 --> 46:36.128
that time they were developing the composites 
program. The composite being just now a material

46:37.490 --> 46:53.620
that is coming into its own, but in those days it was 
a very exotic type of material, very high cost, but

46:37.490 --> 46:53.620
the Air Force was extremely interested in it 
because it gave stiffness properties, strength

46:37.490 --> 46:53.620
properties, and very, very little weight. And it 
also had another feature that is now beginning to

46:54.764 --> 47:02.295
be mentioned, and that is it was invisible to 
radar. And so we brought them into the project

47:02.315 --> 47:08.244
because, again, composites were a means of 
reinforcing shells. That monies ended about

47:10.227 --> 47:16.637
1971, about the time Nixon cut back all type of 
funding. And so for a period of time, from about 71

47:17.377 --> 47:25.733
to 74, I did various things, research, again 
within shells,
