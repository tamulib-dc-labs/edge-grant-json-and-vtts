WEBVTT

00:01.702 --> 00:04.084
Some of them, they just take it, give everything 
they had up. They're going off. You want to send it

00:05.966 --> 00:06.806
up? They see it is going, sure enough, they beg you 
to stay, you know, another year. Get anything you

00:12.011 --> 00:14.453
want, any kind of money. But now you're going to 
stay there next year because your crop ain't going

00:15.214 --> 00:19.057
to occur, you know. It's not going to occur. You let 
your stand. And feed you to the hives. Now have

00:24.602 --> 00:30.207
children like this girl here, this any kind of 
dress she wore, they let you take it up. But now when

00:31.148 --> 00:33.771
the crop come, they'll take a little bit of that 
crop. You wouldn't have nothing to live on next

00:34.472 --> 00:39.058
year until next year come. Well, that old McCown 
was right there for Christmas, you know, get just

00:39.859 --> 00:43.223
what you wanted. That's what they do in places over 
there. But there was sure fine white folks over

00:48.109 --> 00:50.431
there. Before you'd wake up, I had one round over 
there. And that was about some Johnson graves.

01:01.017 --> 01:03.060
What was that? You know, Johnson grass after a 
flood, you know, just seeds washed all over the

01:03.840 --> 01:07.765
field. Well, next year, they'd come up just 
digging that. That's why I wouldn't want you to cut

01:11.570 --> 01:15.735
it up. You want to go over the field and pull it up. 
It's all over the field. Pull it up every spread,

01:19.280 --> 01:20.621
you know. It comes up, you know, like shovel. And 
pull it up. And I wouldn't pull it up. I'd go across

01:26.609 --> 01:28.611
the field digging up like... And he wanted me to 
pull a root and oil up, you know. He told me I was too

01:31.113 --> 01:32.635
old for that. I couldn't do it. He said, well, if you 
can't pull this up, when you get this crop off,

01:34.997 --> 01:40.643
you'll leave. Leave my place. I said, thank you, 
sir. Well, everybody got the crop, you know, made a

01:43.706 --> 01:46.129
good crop that year. Got the crop, he went on to see 
his wife. And his wife come down there one day and

01:48.672 --> 01:55.859
says, Laura, said, ma'am, can you take me to leave? 
I said, yes, and this time I get this crop out, I'm

01:55.879 --> 01:58.362
going to leave, too. Said Mr. Payne was drunk, I 
wouldn't leave. I said, yes ma'am, I'm going to

02:01.233 --> 02:02.575
leave. I'll leave this place. I said, Mr. Payne, 
come in the field sometime. You wouldn't be with

02:05.699 --> 02:06.480
him. Jump on me, kill me. Beat me to death. I said, oh 
no, she said, I wouldn't leave. But see, I done got

02:12.629 --> 02:14.732
scared then, you know. He told me to leave. And I'd 
been there then. I'd been on his place in 16 years.

02:20.660 --> 02:22.703
And it's the first time he ever told me to leave, you 
know. And I just got scared, you know. And I left

02:23.865 --> 02:24.906
now. I left in the house. Sometimes those 
landlords would whip them, they say. He'd fight

02:31.083 --> 02:32.465
them. He'd fight the hands. He would? Yes. They 
wouldn't let him whip them. They'd fight him. He

02:39.277 --> 02:43.805
wouldn't try to hurt none of them, but he'd jump 
down on his horse to fight them, you know. And the

02:44.546 --> 02:45.588
hands would fight him. The men would fight him. And 
he sure was a good old white man, though. And he'd go

02:51.177 --> 02:57.764
to the house on his horse to get a gun, get a gun at 
him. And he'd ride right in the field and come back

02:58.685 --> 03:05.793
with his gun, you know, right up ahead of us. Well, 
Albert followed me a while ago, so-and-so

03:05.813 --> 03:11.359
followed me a while ago, and I'm going back killing 
him. I wouldn't do that. I wouldn't have it in the

03:12.240 --> 03:15.884
name of killing my hands on the place. I wouldn't 
have it to say I hurt none of my hands on the place and

03:15.984 --> 03:19.868
they stayed there. And you don't have no trouble 
with that. Yes, that's so. All right, God, do it

03:23.417 --> 03:24.998
again. I'm going to kill him. We'll be sure to go to 
the white man. We jumped once. We was in the wagon.

03:31.465 --> 03:32.206
We jumped once. Got his gun. Could have did it. Got 
his gun and shoot in the wagon with me and my

03:34.529 --> 03:36.891
children. And his wife hanging to the Winchester 
by the door. Who was he going to shoot at? They were

03:43.879 --> 03:46.362
going to shoot in the wagon at us. Said, my boy, you 
know, put the dog on his dog. You know how dogs is?

03:51.498 --> 03:52.820
You go across by the road. Said, put it on his dog. 
You got to shoot at him. And she hanging to him.

03:56.784 --> 03:58.065
Said, don't you shoot that rag. You kill all of them 
children. I'll kill all of them. One dog jump on my

04:01.289 --> 04:02.770
dog. And this time, she got the gun away from him. 
Went right back and laid down there. Said, no,

04:05.974 --> 04:06.754
don't worry. He was just that. She wants to have 
time handling him. Yes. He was good. They were good

04:12.941 --> 04:13.902
people. But here's fractures, whoop, here's 
fractures.

04:20.123 --> 04:33.955
If you brought out a load of corn, first and 
foremost, you know, if you brought out a load of

04:20.123 --> 04:33.955
corn, and if it wasn't just level, you'd be not 
bringing that load out all level, you'd have to

04:20.123 --> 04:33.955
take some off that corn, first and foremost, so 
it'd give you the little one. Like you said, Mr.

04:33.975 --> 04:36.618
Payne, there's your corn. Oh, sir, I don't want it. 
I don't want it. That corn ain't full load. I don't

04:42.603 --> 04:43.264
want it. He wouldn't have it near. No sir. But he was 
sure good folks. But he sure was fractious. He was

04:52.907 --> 04:53.888
too fractious. But he was good people. And 
therefore he'd better round than drink him. That

05:01.955 --> 05:05.878
way his wife wouldn't stay at the house and he'd 
come to the field. He'd have come with him. Because

05:09.481 --> 05:11.703
you know she's going to have a round with some of the 
colored folks. Is that right? Yes. Right down

05:14.311 --> 05:16.394
there in that bottom, too. Around with the 
colorful. And she'd come along with him. She'd

05:19.379 --> 05:20.481
come along with him every time. If he walked, she'd 
walk with him. If he ran in a wagon, anything, she'd

05:21.803 --> 05:24.967
come, too. Oh, he was so mean. He'd fracture that 
away when he got drinking. Did he ever try to whip

05:30.196 --> 05:32.018
any of them with a whip? No, he never tried to whip 
them with no whip, nothing like that. But he'd jump

05:35.675 --> 05:37.457
right down, be plowing. He's more out of his 
half-hands than anybody else. Be plowing, you

05:40.761 --> 05:43.365
know, and they wouldn't talk to suit him. He'd jump 
right down by the plow with no way to move. He'd go in

05:45.988 --> 05:48.070
off and don't commit to knocking him, you know. And 
they couldn't commit to knocking him, touching

05:48.671 --> 05:50.834
him, too. But anything after he'd fight one of 
them, they'd fight him, too. Fight one of them, and

05:57.662 --> 06:00.706
he'd go out to the house and come to the lock. See, 
they're just as good, you know. Just as good, you

06:03.149 --> 06:03.910
know. He said, well, Sandy come. Let's go to town 
and drink it off. Let's go to town, boy, and drink it

06:09.707 --> 06:11.088
off. They had it wrong with them then all that week. 
He was good for them. They'd go to town. But he let

06:16.534 --> 06:18.596
them go to church any time they wanted to? Yeah, so 
they went to church. He didn't bother about no

06:19.897 --> 06:22.019
church, nothing like that. He had a church right 
there on his place. Right there on his place. He

06:26.264 --> 06:28.526
must have had a lot of hands working for him. He had a 
big plantation. I think he had 700 acres. He had

06:31.909 --> 06:32.530
them. He had 14 houses on the page. They were there 
to call a page, please. He never bothered. One

06:42.285 --> 06:46.390
white man tried to project a church, and that was 
Mr. Morton. He tried to project a colorful church.

06:49.914 --> 06:50.214
Why? He didn't want them to have a church on the 
page, you know. He didn't want them to have it.

07:01.568 --> 07:09.658
Now, you ask me any words you want to ask about the 
exclave, you know, back, and I can remember. Well,

07:10.359 --> 07:12.361
ain't had about how old are you? Well, I don't know, 
Mr. Elkwood. We don't know my age, only by the

07:15.105 --> 07:20.451
children telling us. My mom died, and she didn't 
know nothing about our age. But the children

07:25.057 --> 07:30.023
traced back from the exclave up to now. Well, how 
old were you when you were... Well, I was about 13

07:31.133 --> 07:36.560
years old at the breakup. Uh-huh. And you remember 
slavery days very well? Of course, I remember all

07:40.946 --> 07:45.412
our white folks and all the names of them, all the 
children. Called every one of the children's

07:45.432 --> 07:47.234
names. Who did you belong to? Jim Brunson, the baby 
boy. Where was that? Where did he live? Back out

07:53.462 --> 07:56.106
here in Haines County. How many slaves did he have? 
Well, he had my grandma and... And my ma, my ma was a

08:01.846 --> 08:05.209
cook. And grandma, you know, and then they worked 
in the field. And everything, I remember when she

08:10.074 --> 08:13.977
used to plow oxen. I plowed, I plowed oxen myself. 
Is that right? I can plow and lay off a corn row as

08:18.021 --> 08:20.223
good as any man. Is that right? I used to pick 
cotton. I used to pick, well, I've been here ever

08:25.788 --> 08:28.331
since I've been here. A hundred of them picked my 
500 pounds of cotton. Knock out 500 pounds. Knock

08:33.517 --> 08:35.080
out 500 pounds of cotton. It won't cost a few. And 
hunt watermelons and plum granules. Yeah. Do you

08:41.970 --> 08:45.215
remember church times? Yes, I remember church 
times. You were 20 for a time. Yes, I remember our

08:49.942 --> 08:52.146
folks. They had power meetings from one house to 
another. The colored folks. Yes. Uh-huh. The

08:58.776 --> 08:59.697
people there. You know, the houses, you know, 
would be in sections. And the house was in

09:03.185 --> 09:05.287
different places. They'd go, and we'd have 
priming. More important than good priming. And

09:10.072 --> 09:10.973
dances, too. And dances, too? Yes. I've seen far 
more dancing in the meantime. Is that a doing

09:15.857 --> 09:17.439
slavery thing? Well, my grandma, too. My grandma 
was named Rachel Proctor. Rachel Proctor. Yes,

09:23.325 --> 09:26.027
but she belonged to the Bunnies. That's what she 
meant by her husband's name. Yeah, yes, I knew his

09:29.866 --> 09:31.768
back. Now, in slavery time, there was my sister, my 
brother was slaved back. And all of them stayed

09:43.400 --> 09:49.507
with me, one, one of the girls, and she lived in San 
Antonio, Adelaide Taylor. Adelaide Taylor, so

09:50.267 --> 09:52.370
she was your sister? Yes, she was in the young 
bunch. Sister Ida, and she was the next, Brother

09:55.333 --> 09:59.417
George, And Sister Ida and myself were slaves. And 
others were born free. And all of them, we were only

10:06.174 --> 10:09.179
two slaves. Well, I'm glad. Did you go to meetings? 
Did you ever go to church? We would go to big cast,

10:12.425 --> 10:14.909
prime meetings, you know. We used to show them to us 
in the corner, you know. We used to have a good

10:16.952 --> 10:18.435
opportunity. Is that right? Yes, they cast the 
family. Well, did you go to the white folks' church

10:21.162 --> 10:23.244
any? Yes, I went to Mountain City to the white 
folks' church many times. See, the white folks

10:27.370 --> 10:34.721
would have church in the morning, then we'd let the 
colored people have church at their church in the

10:27.370 --> 10:34.721
evening. That's your slavery. In the slave time. 
In the slave time. Yes, as well. Well, what would

10:40.489 --> 10:42.872
the preacher preach about in those days? I don't 
know. I doesn't go. What does the preacher preach

10:44.935 --> 10:46.397
about, you know? There you go. He didn't preach 
like the dudes, did he? No, they weren't made to

10:51.132 --> 10:58.623
teach, you know, and they all raised how to be, how 
to get along, you know, how to treat the white

10:51.132 --> 10:58.623
people and so on. And they used the Bible, them, you 
know. Yeah, I remember all about it in slavery

11:04.051 --> 11:06.935
time. Born there, we used to go to dances, white 
folks. Well, did the white folks treat you good?

11:14.406 --> 11:16.489
How, for the boys? Uh-huh. They was good to us. They 
never hooked none of their colored people. Our

11:21.261 --> 11:29.030
colored people, they'd take their saddle horse, 
Mrs. Brown's saddle horse, big girl, Anna, and

11:21.261 --> 11:29.030
she'd have them ride. Grandma wouldn't ride from 
Mountain City to church. They had white preachers

11:31.573 --> 11:33.015
then.

11:35.718 --> 11:40.363
Mr. Porter, he was one of the preachers that lived 
across from us. Well, would the white preachers

11:40.799 --> 11:48.110
tell you to behave yourselves and be good to your 
master? Yes, that's what they preached. We really

11:50.234 --> 11:51.856
didn't know it was any such thing. It was God, and in 
the name of God, you know, we thought that was a

11:51.876 --> 11:58.527
different man. But he was our master, our white 
folks, you know, the preachers who was the white

11:58.547 --> 12:04.276
folks' master, and so on that way. He said, well, 
that's all the better. Well, all of them would go up

12:08.525 --> 12:14.072
by the church and ask to come to be free, you know. 
They came to preach it, you know. They came to know,

12:16.515 --> 12:20.539
you know, there was a God, and so on. Well, while you 
all were slaves, did they teach you to read and

12:20.599 --> 12:23.623
write? Did you all go to church? Nuh-uh. Nuh-uh. 
They didn't know nothing about reading and

12:26.206 --> 12:28.529
writing. All that I know, they teach you to mind 
your master and your master. They sure didn't

12:32.133 --> 12:34.136
teach you to read and write. No, they didn't. Pick 
cotton, I remember, picking cotton. Well, did you

12:39.001 --> 12:42.824
ever hear of any slaves being mistreated? Were 
there any tales going around? Yes, I know of times

12:45.607 --> 12:50.471
of mistreated people they did. I hear our folks 
talking about them hooting and all. So they had to

12:53.854 --> 12:57.797
squeeze the back, to take the clothes from the 
back. Good Lord have mercy. My folks, that way. But

13:01.441 --> 13:04.944
them business sure didn't allow them colored 
people to be hooted. And they halted, they started

13:05.604 --> 13:07.506
halted. Mr. Duncan's Saddle Horse and Ma and Pa and 
Ma and Ma and the Green Horse, they rode their

13:07.840 --> 13:14.808
horses in the saddle. Mountain City Church. And 
the children stayed home. And from that on then,

13:20.515 --> 13:26.623
from one to another, began to learn palm teaching 
and amongst them. They'd have a prayer meeting,

13:27.123 --> 13:29.667
you know, from one house to the other. You know, at 
the house, like there's a house sitting here in a

13:30.608 --> 13:37.476
section in line, you know, and people would come to 
the prayer meeting. And on Sunday in the evening,

13:38.030 --> 13:46.558
the white folks let the preacher preach, because 
our folks were the dead church preachers. Well, do

13:48.140 --> 13:52.044
you remember any of the songs they sang in those 
days at churches? No. If I had the books, I could

13:54.006 --> 13:57.909
remember and look and see. They sang the song, Are 
We Born to Die? They'd sing that. Are We Born to Die?

14:07.409 --> 14:08.691
How'd that go, you know? That's right, the 
Secretary-Council we gave. Now, a little while.

14:14.922 --> 14:15.683
Yes, yes. How did it go? Yes. They say I was born to 
die. First Secretary-Council I was given. I was

14:24.458 --> 14:25.039
living. I was sitting back. I never read much. We 
children, we stayed at home, parched corn, and

14:27.062 --> 14:31.830
played, you know. More and more of them grandmas 
ride the horses and about three miles from our

14:32.165 --> 14:41.114
home, white folks' home, where they stay, and go to 
the white folks' church. I used to hear them laugh

14:42.035 --> 14:45.479
and tell it all the time, you know. We didn't know 
anything about freedom at all. It was free that I

14:48.602 --> 14:54.328
was me and my oldest, next oldest sister, my 
brother George. He was there all day, all those

14:54.428 --> 14:58.172
days, but just two of us. Well, can you remember 
when the war was going on? Of course I can. I sat on

15:04.091 --> 15:05.153
the fence. At the time, me and Cousin Lou and Cousin 
Sally and all of us, our lodge had white picket

15:05.774 --> 15:15.930
fence right along by our house, like the road goes 
along by my house. We sat on it, I stood on that

15:16.631 --> 15:23.983
picket fence all day long seeing them soldiers 
going back to San Antonio, a different place. I had

15:24.684 --> 15:26.607
to put in their gloves and beavers. And horses 
would swing and dance and fall just like that. What

15:31.719 --> 15:33.462
are you doing? Culling soldiers. Culling 
soldiers? Well, culling soldiers in droves.

15:38.491 --> 15:40.294
That's right along by our house. Our home is a 
two-story house, a white brook's home, you know.

15:44.601 --> 15:52.054
And we stayed on the home until we bought the homes 
over across the creek while we lived in Portland.

16:00.421 --> 16:10.534
I remember a long time ago, you told me about during 
the big breakup, the soldiers came by and riding

16:00.421 --> 16:10.534
horseback. And you all were sitting on the fence, 
you children. Can you remember that? Yeah. Lean

16:15.861 --> 16:19.226
this way just a little bit and tell about it. Yes, I 
knew that. I sat down all day and looked at them.

16:22.450 --> 16:25.614
They played a few of this music, you know, this joy 
in your life. And so it was, you know, and them

16:26.275 --> 16:29.820
horses, they'd sing, you know. And them horses 
duck and fall on their knees just like that. Oh,

16:33.521 --> 16:34.302
wow. Adam Train. Yeah, Adam Train. Well, what 
about this girl you told me about that one? Well,

16:40.913 --> 16:47.244
that photo was the one that Long Miss photo, one of 
our white folks in there. And she got her own ground

16:47.264 --> 16:51.792
horse and molasses mill, feeding molasses mills. 
How was that? How do you mean feeding the molasses?

16:54.522 --> 16:57.625
Putting that cane in there for it to grind out to 
make molasses. Oh, yeah. Grinding out juice, huh?

16:59.607 --> 17:00.789
Yeah, juice. They had them wooden corks or things, 
you know, master canes back then. And they'd hitch

17:06.434 --> 17:08.637
a mule to it, wouldn't they? Yes. And he'd walk in a 
circle. Yes, yes. He'd walk in a circle. Yes, have a

17:13.682 --> 17:16.464
lever to it, you know, and go round and round. 
Uh-huh. We've made molasses that way. I've made

17:20.684 --> 17:22.685
molasses myself. You have? Well, now this girl got 
her arm drowned off in molasses. Yes, feeding the

17:26.489 --> 17:27.830
molasses mill. That was in another neighborhood. 
Well, how old was she? Oh, she was a great big girl.

17:33.916 --> 17:38.600
She was about big enough to feed the mill. About 10 
or 12 years old, I think. Maybe a little older than

17:40.662 --> 17:44.506
that. And the men would have molasses and pour it. 
She made molasses for everybody in there. That

17:50.377 --> 17:53.242
girl had that milled feet. Can't have canes, you 
know, great big piles, piled up. She had to reach

17:58.892 --> 18:02.358
down and get that and put it in between the corks. 
When that grinded out, she'd pick up another

18:03.439 --> 18:07.186
handful and put it in there. Well, did they have 
good doctors for them in those days? When it ground

18:10.949 --> 18:13.774
off her arm, what did they do? How did they get her 
out? I don't know. I guess they carried her on their

18:15.417 --> 18:16.860
own. I remember Dr. Manilow and Dr. Cavanaugh. I 
remember them. Well, when the soldiers came by,

18:26.799 --> 18:29.504
where was she? Who, Matt? Uh-huh. She was on the 
other side. She lived the other side of us. She was

18:34.743 --> 18:36.865
living, she was living with our white people. But 
this road went right along by our white people's

18:37.205 --> 18:40.369
house. I can go right to the day before I was born 
there. It was cut right along by the house. They did

18:46.155 --> 18:48.717
all day for weeks at the time. There was so many of us 
traveling

18:48.757 --> 18:57.806
going south to Silent Hill. Oh, they had the 
prettiest horses you most ever saw. Well, now,

19:01.130 --> 19:04.513
what did those girls, what did this girl, Matt, do? 
Matt told her? Uh-huh. Well, she fed the mail.

19:07.941 --> 19:10.884
Well, I mean, though, when the soldiers came by. 
Why, she's on the fence by with us, looking at them.

19:14.629 --> 19:17.493
She lived right across from us, you know, and that 
was the road. Well, I thought she went off with the

19:18.153 --> 19:20.096
soldiers. She did. She went off with the soldiers. 
The soldiers come along. We're all sitting on the

19:23.780 --> 19:25.402
fence. And I stand at the fence sitting. And a 
colored soldier come along and asked her, did she

19:28.146 --> 19:31.350
want to go with us? And she said, yes. She miles one 
of them horses. Not behind him? No, it was a horse to

19:36.351 --> 19:37.813
herself. Is that right? We could ride horses. We'd 
jump on them horses. Started some time riding,

19:43.181 --> 19:45.884
some time we learned how to do it. I could stand flat 
footed on the ground and jump on the horse's side

19:46.005 --> 19:50.431
with it. Is that right? Right, right, yeah. Well, 
you were riding. Yes, all of us, all of we always

19:52.834 --> 19:56.038
raced to ride horses. Paul had horses of his own, 
chickens of his own. Well, then what happened to

20:00.856 --> 20:03.799
Mack Porter after she and that soldier? She was on 
with them. I never did see her and hit that over no

20:05.401 --> 20:07.443
more. She was going towards San Tom. Going towards 
San Tom? Yes, she was on with them. Well, what did

20:14.711 --> 20:15.672
she do? Didn't even go tell her mama she was going or 
anything? She didn't have any mother. Oh, I see.

20:21.338 --> 20:23.461
And she'd already been freed, had she? Yes, yes. 
That was the time the soldiers was going back, you

20:24.722 --> 20:29.007
know, after the field. Mm-hmm. She'd always come 
over to our house and stay with us. Well, can you

20:34.148 --> 20:41.635
remember the times right after the big breakup 
very well? Remember, were times pretty hard then?

20:45.578 --> 20:47.920
Yes, times were hard. Our white folks weren't mean 
to their colored people. It was different for

20:51.764 --> 20:53.085
them. There were seven brothers of them. There was 
Shea Bunton, John Bunton, Bob Bunton. We had one,

20:58.838 --> 21:04.406
one, one, Kentucky Joe, so on, a whole pack of them. 
Seven brothers of them, I know. Some of them lived

21:07.751 --> 21:09.173
at Cedar Creek. More or no, the more I know. Well, 
what did y'all do after the big breakup? Did y'all

21:14.941 --> 21:16.363
leave the place? No, we stayed on the place and 
rented on the half. Oh, rented on the half. All our

21:21.771 --> 21:23.633
fight folks was dead. And the old C was, oh, the... 
Breed love. I, Tom, I breed love. I breed love.

21:33.229 --> 21:34.732
Mountain City. That's our old, old, old sale was a 
place, you know. And you all rented on the house.

21:40.501 --> 21:41.823
Rented on the house, too. We bought our home across 
the creek. Oh, you bought your home. About how long

21:46.050 --> 21:48.854
after the big breakup did y'all buy it? Oh, I didn't 
buy it. We didn't buy it. Paul bought the home from

21:51.078 --> 21:55.204
old Riley across the creek, and we stayed down 
there. I used to stay with Aunt Rose and Uncle

21:55.792 --> 21:58.576
George. They were old folks, had no children, you 
know. They used to get me to come and stay with them.

22:04.525 --> 22:07.890
And when I married, they gave me a home on the place. 
Well, were they white folks? No, colored folks.

22:11.154 --> 22:11.735
Oh, good. Well, how old were you when you married? 
Well, I don't know. 17, 18 years old. Maybe that

22:17.724 --> 22:18.685
old. I didn't know my age. Who did you marry? Jim 
Smith. Jim Smith. Had he been a slave? Oh, yes. He

22:32.262 --> 22:34.265
was a slave. After the breakup, they sent him. He 
come from Blackpool and bought a home over across

22:36.468 --> 22:42.096
the creek while we bought a home, Johnny, and our 
home. His father and mother did, you know.

22:48.906 --> 22:52.191
Well, he had been freed then, I guess, the at the 
same time you had. Oh, yes, yes. They lived at

22:56.357 --> 22:57.499
Blanco. They bought them a home over in the colony. 
Riley had sold the colored people all the homes

23:02.266 --> 23:05.411
there. I don't know. Who was Riley? A white man 
named Riley lived right down the hill from us. They

23:12.442 --> 23:19.073
sold Pete Bradley homes and Paul homes, Uncle 
David homes. Oh, all of them. Well, I'm glad. And

23:21.942 --> 23:24.644
that was right after the big break-up, was it? 
About two, three years after the break-up. Huh.

23:27.787 --> 23:29.809
And you just had a colony of... Yes, all that 
colony. Where I come from, it's got homes out

23:31.331 --> 23:34.514
there. That's Buda, they called it now. It was 
nothing but woods when we bought it. They called it

23:40.579 --> 23:42.121
Buda then? Yes. Oh, I know where Buda is. Yes, yes, 
yes. Did you know Mr. Talley in those days? I think I

23:47.506 --> 23:49.127
did know Mr. Talley. Huh. What was he? He was a 
deputy sheriff, that's why. Is that right? Yes. He

23:57.270 --> 24:01.436
was my fine man, too.

24:10.788 --> 24:11.529
Yeah. Sure is. And you remember, can you remember 
churches very well in Hatton? Were you a church

24:16.275 --> 24:17.477
goer? No, we used to show them then when slavery 
time. My mother and father, I can remember when

24:21.119 --> 24:25.163
they went to church. Our white folks, they'd ride 
to go to church in the morning, you know. And they'd

24:28.847 --> 24:33.292
go in the evening, my grandma, to the white folks' 
church. And they'd ride their horses. Well, then

24:35.654 --> 24:38.177
when did you start going to church? Oh, yeah, I 
never started going to church. We never had any

24:41.000 --> 24:45.304
church until much after I married. Well, and you 
started going, didn't you? After you got married?

24:53.275 --> 24:54.196
How did you marry? Did you have a preacher marry 
you? Of course, a white preacher married us. He

24:58.760 --> 24:59.161
did? A white preacher married all of us girls.

25:06.969 --> 25:10.992
There wasn't any preacher much when I married. 
Well, who did you... When did you first start going

25:13.617 --> 25:16.461
to church then? Well, we'd go to church then, and we 
had church before, before it was locked. You know,

25:22.689 --> 25:26.154
preachers didn't know anything, you know, on what 
they hid. Was he a traveling preacher, or was he

25:26.194 --> 25:29.899
just a colored preacher? Yes, just traveling, you 
know, and stopping to preach. There was a haywood,

25:33.043 --> 25:37.169
and groins, and so that was our preacher's name.

25:40.633 --> 25:41.895
Well, what would you preach about? Can you 
remember? Well, they just preached that we had a

25:43.267 --> 25:50.755
God and a soul to be saved and so on. Did the preacher 
preach today? Oh, no. They didn't know nothing.

25:55.961 --> 26:00.766
They only read the Bible sometimes in places they 
could read. No, they weren't. The priest wasn't

26:02.188 --> 26:03.549
educated to talk. They weren't, huh? No, on the 
spell. Some of them was reading right talk. No, the

26:07.453 --> 26:10.537
spell, the letter, and so on. They were reading 
right talk.

26:19.362 --> 26:24.049
Some of them couldn't read and write at all, just 
only the priests. What they could ever say, you

26:24.069 --> 26:25.851
know. Then some of them laughed at getting older 
and wiser, you know. Well, what about the songs

26:30.197 --> 26:32.340
that they sang? That's what I'm interested in. I 
didn't go much into the songs. Well, they sang

26:36.907 --> 26:40.552
these old 100s. You know what an old 100 means? 
Yeah, these old-time songs. Uh-huh. Yeah. Well,

26:44.489 --> 26:46.832
they're lying off one, you know. It's Jesus, bear 
the cross alone, and all the world will go free.

26:52.400 --> 26:53.141
Yeah, yeah. That's the end going, I say. There's no 
way of speaking to you like that. You're treated by

26:59.030 --> 27:01.674
them. Yeah. Yes, he sang them songs. I had the 
old-time books, hymn books. Well, where would you

27:09.265 --> 27:11.788
get those books? They had them selling them. My 
grandma and them bought them, you know. My husband

27:17.576 --> 27:18.918
bought eight people. Jim Booker. Was your 
husband, Henry Smith, much of a... Jim Smith? Oh,

27:25.508 --> 27:25.889
Jim Smith. Mm-hmm. Was he a church man? Yes, he was. 
What happened to him? Church man, church man, a

27:31.757 --> 27:35.242
politic man, too. Oh, they were. Y'all voted in 
those days. Yes, my husband was in it. He was run by a

27:38.707 --> 27:40.450
high school. He was well up there. When he got 
killed, the white folk was just crazy about him.

27:46.497 --> 27:47.999
They come pretty soon. That boy that killed my 
husband, I nursed him when he was a baby. How come he

27:52.464 --> 27:54.367
didn't kill your husband? Well, he's just mean. 
Just mean, you know. And they didn't like people up

27:57.110 --> 27:59.553
to date, you know. And of course, it was just 13 
months until my husband killed his brother. Stole

28:06.802 --> 28:07.743
him. Killed his last brother. Mm-hmm. He'd been to 
church. I think he went to jail that night to carry a

28:11.081 --> 28:14.584
barrel of cotton. And this Walter Byers sat down on 
the seat and the whole class of them was sitting

28:14.604 --> 28:20.469
down talking. And when the time had come to his 
cotton, they killed him. And they killed my

28:24.733 --> 28:28.616
brother, my husband, on the way from Cedar Bay. I go 
right to the spot now, and that's why he was killed

28:28.636 --> 28:31.699
there. Shot him or killed him? Shot him. Shot him on 
the way from Cedar Bay. See, we'd have a Cedar Bay at

28:35.502 --> 28:38.685
home after we went home. Well,

28:39.053 --> 28:46.463
what kind of politics did he do? Well, he worked for 
white people when they wanted to be elected, you

28:46.483 --> 28:54.333
know, in the state at that time. He worked amongst 
the colored folks. Amongst the colored people. He

28:56.896 --> 28:58.338
didn't speak to white folks. He couldn't get in the 
house when he spoke hardly to white people. All

29:02.463 --> 29:04.386
that sex in there. He had a good life. He had all of 
them boys there. And he'd round up the votes, and

29:08.990 --> 29:12.876
that's how come them to kill him. And when he sat the 
night for a speech, people from Austin, from San

29:12.896 --> 29:22.871
Marcos, from everywhere to be white and colored to 
hear him speak. He'd go to the courthouse and speak

29:22.891 --> 29:30.162
for

29:22.891 --> 29:30.162
them. Well, did the colored folks not like him? No, 
the colored people all went. that these white

29:37.930 --> 29:51.427
people, this boy that killed him, who walked by, I 
nursed him when he was a baby before I was ever

29:37.930 --> 29:51.427
acquainted with my husband. Well, what I'm trying 
to find out is, how come he didn't kill your

29:52.108 --> 29:54.832
husband? Was it over politics? Oh, politics and 
different things, you know. Poor white people.

30:03.683 --> 30:06.587
Did the white folks have your husband killed, or 
did... Did he just walk by and just go shoot

30:06.854 --> 30:10.397
himself? No, my husband went to the break that day. 
And on his way back from the city break,

30:14.241 --> 30:23.149
he ran through the road and killed him. And I said, 
there's something about the horse. I don't know

30:25.131 --> 30:33.338
how that is done, but the white people, Walter 
Kaiser, the name of the first one that got to him

30:25.131 --> 30:33.338
when he was killed, they had to shoot him. They 
brought the news to us. My brother and them. What'd

30:39.552 --> 30:41.054
they do to Walter Biles? Well, you know why? That's 
what he lived up in there, you know. They could tell

30:44.919 --> 30:46.642
any kind of tale. They didn't do nothing with him. 
Had him up. Put him in jail. But his brother-in-law

30:52.169 --> 30:53.651
killed him. Is that right? Sure. They must have 
been shooting a lot of folk up in those days. Poor

31:01.482 --> 31:02.843
people, you know. Rich white people don't bother 
nobody. Or poor white folks. Yeah, it was poor. And

31:08.701 --> 31:09.882
they come out. And his brother-in-law said Lawson 
killed him. Said his father moved away. He had a

31:16.530 --> 31:17.992
good home over there. And they moved away. Said 
they'd steal his life. Just like they stole Bud's

31:21.256 --> 31:23.058
and Jim's. And his boy's life. So he left and went to

31:24.720 --> 31:31.548
Oklahoma. His brother-in-law killed him. He 
rolled up the fence that night and killed his

31:32.649 --> 31:35.012
brother-in-law. His brother-in-law shot him 
instead? Yes. His mother tried to keep him from

31:38.306 --> 31:44.676
killing him, but he said, I ain't going to let him 
kill me like he did Uncle Jim. You know, he said, him

31:44.716 --> 31:49.223
and my boys are all raised together. Y'all must 
have all been kinfolks in those days. Right. Well,

31:54.672 --> 31:58.478
all of these things have been... Quite true. No, 
they're fake.
