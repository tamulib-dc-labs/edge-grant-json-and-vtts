WEBVTT

00:01.820 --> 00:12.959
The boys were all in uniform, even the physically 
unfit boys wore a uniform with a NM on the collar,

00:01.820 --> 00:12.959
meaning non-military. There were no women on the 
campus other than secretaries, and even some of

00:14.782 --> 00:25.279
the department heads had male secretaries at that 
time. Before we start talking about Texas A&M,

00:25.934 --> 00:36.104
could I ask you a question about your decision to go 
into veterinarian sciences? Was it just because

00:37.185 --> 00:44.832
you grew up with these cattle, and was it because 
you had a neighbor who was a veterinarian, or were

00:37.185 --> 00:44.832
there other reasons? Well, that was the primary 
reason. Who knows why a kid wants to be a college

00:46.174 --> 00:53.461
clown, a circus clown, or a railway engineer or 
whatnot? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. The biggest thrill I

00:55.246 --> 01:02.816
ever got was when we went out and old Sal was trying 
to have pigs and the veterinarian's hand was too

00:55.246 --> 01:02.816
big. And I went in and pulled the pigs out and I got 
two dollars. I got it for that. He charged five and

01:11.467 --> 01:16.594
he gave me two because I could help him. And then he 
showed me how to clean out a horse's hoof and things

01:18.036 --> 01:23.363
like that. And all three years I worked in the 
foundry, I still had the back of my mind that I was

01:24.608 --> 01:31.197
going to be a veterinarian someday. Of course, 
they'd give me hands and arms.

01:38.027 --> 01:43.755
Were there, when you were working in the foundry, 
were there any other professions that you ever

01:38.027 --> 01:43.755
considered? No. No, in fact, when I went to Kansas 
State, they offered me a year's

01:54.865 --> 02:00.974
what do you call it, credit in engineering because 
of my foundry experience. I'd taken

02:03.137 --> 02:16.136
correspondence course while I worked in the 
foundry, metalurgy and so forth, but I always

02:03.137 --> 02:16.136
wanted to be a veterinarian. Okay, okay. Now can 
you explain your exactly what your functions or

02:22.118 --> 02:27.685
duties were when you came to Texas A&M? I helped Dr. 
Smith. Oh, you were his assistant. Yeah. I don't

02:33.752 --> 02:42.603
know whether you know it or not, but at that time 
there were three distinct entities on the A&M

02:33.752 --> 02:42.603
campus. There was the Texas Agriculture 
Experiment Station, there was the Texas

02:42.623 --> 02:50.252
Agriculture Extension Service, And there was a 
teaching college. And each one had its own

02:54.293 --> 02:56.796
separate head. And each one went to the 
legislature for its appropriation. So in other

03:04.547 --> 03:14.000
words, for example, we had a Department of 
Veterinary, of Dairy Science. We had an

03:15.442 --> 03:18.146
Experimentation Dairy Science. And we had an 
Extension Service Dairyman. They were not

03:21.164 --> 03:29.855
related to each other at all, administratively. 
Of course informally, there was a lot of give and

03:29.875 --> 03:32.158
take. Right,

03:32.759 --> 03:39.387
right. But

03:39.407 --> 03:50.361
we worked in the Veterinary Science Department of 
the Texas Ag God's Experimentation We worked on

03:52.163 --> 04:14.145
various diseases, including anthrax,

03:52.163 --> 04:14.145
brucellosis,

03:52.163 --> 04:14.145
mineral deficiencies, and parasitism.

04:14.165 --> 04:21.512
And Dr. Smith was primarily interested in 
pathology and mineral deficiencies. And he

04:22.808 --> 04:28.757
didn't care much for parasites.

04:31.261 --> 04:35.828
He gave that to me as my baby.

04:35.848 --> 04:50.571
And I became intensely interested in it and worked 
out a master's degree in biology because at that

04:35.848 --> 04:50.571
time there were no master's degrees in the School 
of Veterinary Medicine. It was a school. It wasn't

04:51.608 --> 04:52.389
a college. It was a school.

04:58.816 --> 05:13.692
And

04:58.816 --> 05:13.692
in 1937, they established a Department of 
Veterinary Parastrology in the School of

04:58.816 --> 05:13.692
Veterinary Medicine. A Dr. H.L. Van We

05:20.015 --> 05:32.429
were on the same floor, the top floor of old Francis 
Hall.

05:35.453 --> 05:46.505
And I often went to him with my problems

05:35.453 --> 05:46.505
and also helped him with some of his. So I got I 
should say I obtained quite a bit of formal

05:51.082 --> 06:02.615
parasitology without even realizing it.

06:02.635 --> 06:08.040
And often I would take his classes when he was ill or 
out of town or whatnot. And the more I

06:09.542 --> 06:19.553
delved into it, the more I became interested. 1938 
I

06:21.794 --> 06:34.913
got a hearing aid and the whole world immediately 
changed its aspect. This was a cumbersome thing.

06:38.819 --> 06:45.810
The receiver was about three to six inches by an 
inch and a half and the battery pack weighed about a

06:38.819 --> 06:45.810
pound. So I had Johnny

06:52.405 --> 07:00.535
or what that Houston, Johnny Holly,

06:52.405 --> 07:00.535
built a harness for me.

07:03.879 --> 07:10.046
Resembled nothing in the world more than an 
underarm holster to carry the batteries. And we

07:12.369 --> 07:21.400
were at State Fair in 1939, my wife and I going 
around gawking, and a fella came up next to me He

07:22.578 --> 07:24.080
said, I'd like to see you for a minute. Well, he 
looked like he was big enough to.

07:31.548 --> 07:35.353
At least he impressed me, and I said, well, what 
about? He showed me his shield, and he said, let's

07:36.834 --> 07:40.639
step in here a minute. He said, will you kindly 
unbutton your shirt? He thought I was wearing a

07:43.762 --> 07:45.164
gun. Really? Under my left. A shoulder holster. 
Yeah. That's what it really, that's what it looked

07:52.548 --> 07:54.870
like. Well, with that hearing aid, I was quite 
relieved when I answered the telephone and I'd

07:56.251 --> 08:10.064
take the receiver and put it against the 
receiver's telephone against my receiver. I

08:10.084 --> 08:22.015
remember I was over at Livingston one night and I 
wanted to make a call and I took the receiver and put

08:10.084 --> 08:22.015
it against my hearing aid and started talking to 
the the transmitter. A little Mexican boy went

08:26.046 --> 08:30.732
nuts there trying to tell me, no, no, no, you don't 
use it that way. I finally opened my shirt and

08:33.036 --> 08:35.719
showed him. He said, oh. And I've had people come to 
my office and I had a piece of foam rubber in the top

08:40.166 --> 08:49.098
drawer of my desk. And when the telephones rang, it 
was one of them old fast ones that The receiver hung

08:53.264 --> 08:54.786
on the stand, you know. I'd take the receiver off 
and drop it in the desk so I could lean against it.

09:00.872 --> 09:04.817
And I'd just talk into the telephone. And the time a 
county agent came in, the little boy, oh, he was

09:04.837 --> 09:11.464
little, I'd say he was 10 or 11. Phone rang and I 
said, pardon me a minute. I took the receiver off

09:14.387 --> 09:19.693
and dropped it in the desk drawer and leaned 
against it and started talking. I had my hand free

09:19.713 --> 09:22.596
to use my pencil. The kid looked up and said, I'll be 
goddamned.

09:27.942 --> 09:30.485
So then I explained to him what I was doing. And I'd 
go out to examine the animal. I had an extra long

09:35.209 --> 09:36.690
cord on it. I'd take it off and put it against the 
animal and use it as a test scope. And it worked

09:40.914 --> 09:46.660
better than any I've ever had since.

09:46.680 --> 09:50.203
Well, 1943.

09:52.698 --> 09:57.545
Dr. Van Valkenburg died suddenly of a heart 
attack.

10:03.735 --> 10:06.219
And they offered the department to me. Actually, 
it was just a one-man department.

10:14.611 --> 10:21.642
But

10:14.611 --> 10:21.642
I was making $3,600 a year with the experiment 
station. The authority department was 4,500 so I

10:24.085 --> 10:31.836
took it with no regrets. Dr. Smith was rather 
impatient

10:33.378 --> 10:50.221
with me but after all I'd worked for him nine years 
and I decided I could handle teaching with a

10:33.378 --> 10:50.221
hearing aid. So then

10:56.570 --> 10:57.712
Things rocked along.

11:00.756 --> 11:02.158
What were you teaching then? Peristalsis.

11:05.604 --> 11:06.725
Veterinary peristalsis. And also infectious and 
non-infectious diseases.

11:15.418 --> 11:24.552
Okay, now can we stop for a moment and talk about 
teaching and the curriculum back in the 1930s and

11:25.223 --> 11:29.988
the early 1940s. Was there an overall aim of the vet 
program at that time? Well, the overall aim then

11:37.876 --> 11:41.399
was primarily to turn out practitioners. Right. 
And they were, as I recall, six departments. There

11:48.766 --> 11:52.530
was bacteriology.

11:56.645 --> 12:01.850
Dr. Dunn,

11:56.645 --> 12:01.850
pathology doctor. What's that guy's name?

12:09.977 --> 12:15.782
Anyway, Dr. Jaggi was brought in in 1937 on public 
health. I was teaching parapsychology. Dr. Lent

12:19.285 --> 12:20.706
was teaching clinic.

12:23.369 --> 12:24.930
I can't think of the pathologist's name.

12:31.087 --> 12:33.209
I'll think of it after a while. Anyway, Dr. 
Marsteller was dean,

12:33.229 --> 12:43.821
and he also helped in the clinic.

12:47.845 --> 12:57.415
And since parasitology was only two, three-hour 
courses, I also helped in the clinic.

13:01.208 --> 13:03.511
In infected and non-infected diseases.

13:08.619 --> 13:20.937
Then the war came along

13:08.619 --> 13:20.937
and we went up on what you call the speed-up 
program. We took in a class every four months.

13:26.946 --> 13:28.007
Instead of one every year? Yeah. Well, why was 
that? Well, there weren't but about six or eight

13:30.993 --> 13:34.918
students in the class.

13:37.942 --> 13:42.108
So some years, we had graduations three times a 
year. In other words, the class of 45, some

13:44.231 --> 13:51.661
graduated in February and some along in April or 
May and some in September.

13:54.424 --> 13:58.570
And the entire veterinary faculty was reduced to 
about 12 people. From what was it before then,

13:59.630 --> 14:02.533
before the war? Oh, about 15 or 20, I imagine. 
Pardon

14:04.775 --> 14:22.272
me. I'll tell you how many there are now. Pardon me, 
I have to go to the bathroom. Fine.

15:28.021 --> 15:48.747
The name of the pathologist was Wharton, 
W-H-A-R-T-O-N.

15:28.021 --> 15:48.747
Now getting back to the war, did the war, did the 
war, was the federal government interested in

15:28.021 --> 15:48.747
increasing the number of veterinarians? Is that 
why you tripled the program? No. We were just

15:53.092 --> 15:57.758
trying to get enough credit hours on the books to 
get our paper from the state. In other words, we

15:58.818 --> 16:01.200
just had six boys in the class.

16:07.505 --> 16:09.487
Well, how did you, how did you, uh... I don't really 
know the reason for it. I was just a, I was an old man

16:11.509 --> 16:17.093
on a toilet bowl then. But I do know that we took, you 
can probably find someplace else, quiet. Yeah,

16:22.158 --> 16:23.779
okay, fine. But, fact remains, we took in the class 
every, every four months. Okay. In other, in any

16:30.442 --> 16:37.750
other ways did the war affect the vet school or your 
position? Well no, except that of course we had

16:38.951 --> 16:53.407
trouble getting supplies and we had instructors 
leaving because they were in the reserve or draft.

16:54.148 --> 16:57.732
For example, Dr. Armstead, Dr. Spangler, a whole 
bunch of them.

17:00.850 --> 17:01.972
went in as officers. That's why we're down to about 
12, or at the most, 14.

17:14.052 --> 17:22.947
Now getting back to the aim of the vet program, what 
did you think back in the late 1930s were the strong

17:14.052 --> 17:22.947
and weak points? Well. 1930s see I didn't come here 
in 36. Well that's yeah the late 1930s. And I was in

17:31.849 --> 17:47.907
Experiment Station until 1943 so

17:31.849 --> 17:47.907
I really didn't have too much to do with it except 
that of course Experiment Station would try to

17:31.849 --> 17:47.907
find out why things happened. Sure. And try to 
elaborate or devise a message of bringing disease

17:57.567 --> 18:09.443
under control, the

17:57.567 --> 18:09.443
good of veterinary medicine, I said, was 
primarily interested in turning out

17:57.567 --> 18:09.443
practitioners. In fact, Dr. Marks used to say, get 
the boys out with the animals. You can look at them

18:15.972 --> 18:17.995
flies on a cloudy day. And he took a rather dim view 
of laboratory procedures as such.

18:29.461 --> 18:32.985
but I don't really know. Actually the school 
didn't begin to really boom until after the war

18:33.025 --> 18:42.176
when the GIs came back. Now when you started 
teaching in 1943,

18:43.758 --> 18:57.215
let's talk for a minute about what courses you were 
teaching. Well I was teaching But in their

19:00.258 --> 19:21.710
parasitology, which includes the general 
conception of what parasites are, then parasites

19:00.258 --> 19:21.710
is a dog and cat, and parasites are cattle, and 
parasites are oranges, parasites are runes,

19:00.258 --> 19:21.710
sheep, goats, and cattle. So it

19:21.730 --> 19:28.560
was Active economic parasitology.

19:42.164 --> 19:53.794
Let's see what...

19:42.164 --> 19:53.794
Oh, I see. Parasites and parasitic disease. 
That's the last one out.

20:09.108 --> 20:12.616
It's a lot more complicated than the average 
person thinks. Oh, looks tremendously

20:12.636 --> 20:16.806
complicated to me.

20:32.834 --> 20:44.891
What were the major, back in

20:32.834 --> 20:44.891
those days, what were the major problems in the 
field with the parasites? I mean, which were the

20:44.911 --> 20:48.877
major diseases that you were working to overcome? 
The parasites in cattle and horses primarily,

20:49.938 --> 20:58.150
since cattle were the mainstay of the Texas 
ranchers.

21:02.247 --> 21:06.072
and that includes knowledge of the drugs and the 
dosages. We did a lot of work on trying out new

21:06.273 --> 21:08.896
drugs. In fact, the first

21:11.239 --> 21:19.891
doses of several commonly used drugs were first at 
Texas A&M. For example? Yeah. Well,

21:31.964 --> 21:36.651
Oh, you have to watch

21:31.964 --> 21:36.651
me. Phenothiazine, for example.

21:41.377 --> 21:44.942
We were the first to show that phenothiazine could 
be poisonous to horses.

21:50.891 --> 21:51.752
When about was that? Oh, that was the 1940s. 1950s,

21:55.257 --> 22:00.925
thiobenzol, which is a common wormer.

22:16.000 --> 22:25.056
We also taught external parasites as well, 
horseflies, spaceflies, cattle grubs, lice,

22:16.000 --> 22:25.056
mites,

22:35.060 --> 22:48.732
I would think that this would be one of the very 
important parts of the School of Veterinary

22:35.060 --> 22:48.732
Medicine because one of the main reasons it was 
founded was because of the parasitic problem with

22:35.060 --> 22:48.732
tick fever. That's right. And I saw the last group 
of cattle treated for tick fever over in

22:50.494 --> 23:03.345
Liberty County in 1936, shortly after I came here.

23:08.050 --> 23:11.894
At that time, we used arsenical dips. Of course, at 
the present time, it would be absolutely

23:11.914 --> 23:29.473
impossible to eradicate the Texas fever ticks 
because the

23:11.914 --> 23:29.473
federal government wouldn't let you use a 
compound as poisonous as arsenic. But we didn't

23:31.755 --> 23:35.239
know it, and we went ahead and got rid of it anyway.

23:40.754 --> 23:50.166
Trying to find the... How did the cattle withstand 
this dipping in arsenic? Well, if it was done

23:50.967 --> 24:07.268
properly, there wasn't too much danger, but if 
they got a little bit too strong, of course you got

23:50.967 --> 24:07.268
arsenical burns, and there's no doubt that some of 
them died

23:50.967 --> 24:07.268
because they were weak and poor and The actual 
physical trauma of running them through a dipping

24:08.075 --> 24:13.596
vat didn't do them any good.

24:40.981 --> 24:51.255
I'm trying to find the...

24:40.981 --> 24:51.255
Oh, too much trouble. Look at that. I do want to show 
you something, though.

24:59.767 --> 25:03.072
I'm a contributor to the last issue of the Merck 
Manual. I've helped them since it started. When

25:06.076 --> 25:06.937
did this start? This is the Merck Veterinarian 
Manual. I don't know. I believe that's the fifth

25:11.833 --> 25:13.715
issue. Maybe it's the fourth issue. That's the 
last one. Don't tell which issue it is. Fifth.

25:20.625 --> 25:22.247
Fifth, yeah. It's the last. It's the most recent 
one.

25:39.130 --> 25:40.452
I worked on that last summer. I have another 
question about when you started teaching back in

25:42.524 --> 25:46.568
1943. Can you describe the students? Yes. The 
students were, as a rule, much more serious than

25:54.176 --> 25:58.841
the general college. Most

26:00.283 --> 26:12.295
of them came and took veterinary medicine because 
they wanted to be a veterinarian. not for any

26:12.612 --> 26:16.317
financial gain or whatnot. And it seemed to me like 
a lot of them, predominant,

26:16.337 --> 26:37.302
I believe, were people who had been closely 
associated with veterinary medicine, either

26:16.337 --> 26:37.302
their dad was a veterinarian or their uncle was a 
veterinarian or they had a brother who was a

26:16.337 --> 26:37.302
veterinarian or whatnot. But veterinary 
students have always been I don't know, less your

26:42.818 --> 26:48.947
college, you know the way I see it, than the 
students as a whole. More serious. More serious.

26:51.790 --> 26:57.979
And veterinary medicine has always been pretty 
much of a tough course. We used to say the only

26:58.360 --> 27:08.614
curriculum that was worse than veterinary 
medicine was taking up all the students' time was

26:58.360 --> 27:08.614
architecture. Because the architects have to do 
all their drawings and plans and things and have to

27:12.721 --> 27:30.206
take engineering and stresses and strains and

27:12.721 --> 27:30.206
so they were the only ones really that we felt like 
had to work as hard as we did. Were there at this time

27:32.129 --> 27:39.339
back in the 1940s were there any women students? 
No. There were no women allowed in the college.

27:42.568 --> 27:43.910
Yeah, yeah. But I thought that at some 
professional schools, some women... Oh, at other

27:43.930 --> 27:48.357
schools there were. There were women from Iowa, 
there were women from Kansas State, there were

27:48.397 --> 27:53.965
women from Philadelphia, there were women from 
Colorado.

27:57.651 --> 28:03.599
In fact, there were two girls in school at the time I 
was back in 1930, in the 1930s. At Kansas State.

28:05.743 --> 28:06.564
Yeah. Mm-hmm. When were the first women allowed?

28:12.718 --> 28:13.679
You'll have to check. I believe Dr. Rutter let them 
in, what, in 1960? I don't know. I know I didn't have

28:19.146 --> 28:23.952
any women in any of my classes. Okay, okay. Okay, 
how about blacks? Any blacks in the student body? I

28:33.343 --> 28:35.325
mean in the veterinary college. That's something 
I've never been able to understand.

28:40.100 --> 28:46.846
Blacks are not particularly interested in blood 
and medicine. There's, to my knowledge, there's

28:46.866 --> 28:54.032
never been a black, I mean, during my teaching 
years, there was never a black in school. Kansas

28:56.554 --> 29:03.319
State, when I was there in the 30s, there was only 
one black boy and he flunked out his freshman year.

29:05.781 --> 29:06.522
No, there were two. One of them was Ted Williams, 
the lady with the There were only two that I knew

29:11.234 --> 29:13.216
then. And

29:14.317 --> 29:23.046
they've been made the same way, American Veteran 
Medical Association. We have enough women to have

29:23.066 --> 29:27.771
an organization of their own, but there's no 
blacks to speak of. Oh, I imagine it'd be less than

29:27.971 --> 29:32.596
1% if I had to guess. I doubt it's that high. They 
want to, I don't know. I'm just talking off the top

29:37.260 --> 29:38.802
of my head now. It seems to me like they, They want to 
be lawyers or doctors or something else. But their

29:44.681 --> 29:46.382
medicine just don't appeal to them. And I don't 
know why because I've known some black stable men

29:46.403 --> 29:56.531
out here at college that were really magicians 
with animals. I know one man in particular who used

29:56.551 --> 30:08.882
to go into a horse stall with a rough heart and he'd 
quiet him down, talk baby talk to him and bring him

29:56.551 --> 30:08.882
out with no trouble at all.

30:09.824 --> 30:12.768
Come to think of it, there's not even too many black 
jockeys. There aren't, no. I don't know why. No, I

30:15.693 --> 30:16.734
don't either. I don't know why. You have to ask a 
black man. Okay. But we've never had blacks. Now,

30:25.067 --> 30:33.520
they may have been one or two going through the 
years since I left there 12 years

30:25.067 --> 30:33.520
ago. As far as the students... What did you think 
the overall quality of the students, I know you

30:37.499 --> 30:49.094
talked about that they were hard workers, but the 
overall quality and intelligence, et cetera, did

30:37.499 --> 30:49.094
that change? Well, I think it changed for the 
better because, I don't know, about 20 years ago,

30:50.115 --> 31:00.348
15, everybody decided bed and medicine was a good 
deal. I don't know why. That's always been a

31:03.331 --> 31:04.553
mystery to me. When I went to Kansas State, there 
were 40 boys in my class. And about 10 of them were

31:09.499 --> 31:11.142
Kansans. The rest of them were out of state.

31:17.212 --> 31:27.329
And yet, all of a sudden, they came to the rest to get 
the veterinary medicine if they had to put a quote

31:17.212 --> 31:27.329
on it. And they not only put a quote.
