WEBVTT

00:02.005 --> 00:19.167
a grant proposal of some sort and being funded so that I was able to buy some wave tanks so we could actually do some very simple, really, I would call high school senior level physics experiments.

00:19.868 --> 00:21.490
But it was absolutely nothing.

00:24.434 --> 00:29.160
What was your first impression of the capability of the students here?

00:30.187 --> 00:41.537
Geology students don't think like physicists in general.

00:41.798 --> 00:50.165
And I think part of the problem is that my background, of course, was in physics and math.

00:50.906 --> 00:58.573
And many of these students were, including the graduate students, really were not able to handle simple calculus.

00:59.296 --> 01:01.259
And that was bothersome.

01:04.964 --> 01:11.632
I do recall one of my first classes when I had a class of eight or nine.

01:14.877 --> 01:20.825
I had given one B and a bunch of Cs and maybe a D. I didn't give any As.

01:22.266 --> 01:27.193
And I had this delegation from the Corps that appeared on my doorstep one day.

01:27.595 --> 01:38.869
insisting that the student I'd given a B to deserved an A. It turned out it would disturb his straight A's or whatever.

01:38.889 --> 01:42.533
Of course, I didn't change my grade.

01:43.074 --> 01:46.738
But I was somewhat shocked that a group would.

01:48.721 --> 01:53.687
I'd never heard of the environment I came from.

01:53.920 --> 01:57.929
thought to try to persuade a professor to change a student's grade.

01:58.931 --> 02:12.823
You might discuss with a professor an exam if you felt it was graded unfairly, but to demand of a professor that he change his grade because this student was an A student and he was the best student in this group.

02:14.052 --> 02:15.073
Boggle my mind.

02:18.697 --> 02:23.261
Trace now the growth and development of geophysics.

02:23.962 --> 02:24.963
All right, I'll try.

02:25.063 --> 02:27.666
In those mid-60s.

02:28.347 --> 02:39.618
Well, I think the first major thing that happened, and perhaps John Calhoun would be able to tell you more about that, because I was never in the loop.

02:41.700 --> 02:43.182
I was low man on the totem.

02:43.938 --> 02:48.166
But they formed the College of Geosciences, I think, in 65.

02:49.729 --> 03:00.208
And that college, in order to, I guess, give it some numbers, they made geophysics a separate department.

03:01.184 --> 03:04.891
And then there was geology.

03:05.332 --> 03:07.456
They made geography a separate department.

03:07.596 --> 03:15.350
I guess Ed Duran was one of the professors in geography that I recall.

03:16.472 --> 03:18.356
Oceanography and meteorology.

03:18.917 --> 03:23.445
Now, I think oceanography and meteorology had been in the College of Science.

03:23.425 --> 03:25.691
And so they were pulled out of there.

03:27.495 --> 03:33.570
Geology, geophysics was pulled out of engineering.

03:33.736 --> 03:35.739
And were made two separate departments.

03:35.759 --> 03:37.523
Made into two separate departments.

03:38.083 --> 03:48.541
And so for a year, that following year, I was alone as a department.

03:48.582 --> 03:50.004
I was a department of one person.

03:50.104 --> 03:51.607
You were geophysics.

03:51.627 --> 03:53.550
I was geophysics formally.

03:54.003 --> 03:58.770
Although Trav Parker approved whatever.

03:59.632 --> 04:01.054
But I was geophysics.

04:01.975 --> 04:04.880
Talk about crazy.

04:05.641 --> 04:06.482
This didn't make sense.

04:06.983 --> 04:10.408
Who was the first dean?

04:10.743 --> 04:11.504
Horace Beyer.

04:12.185 --> 04:12.826
Please.

04:13.227 --> 04:16.451
And he was superb, really superb.

04:16.531 --> 04:24.082
He is a fine scientist and a really fine administrator.

04:24.623 --> 04:36.480
And at that time, what I do remember in the administration of the college is, well, because that goes back to another thing that I found when I got here.

04:36.460 --> 04:41.447
in terms of any democratic operation, the university was not.

04:41.907 --> 04:46.373
The faculty had very little to say about many things.

04:47.935 --> 04:52.020
And, you know, as an administrator, you can argue those things back and forth.

04:52.100 --> 04:57.928
But for somebody coming from New England, I thought it was,

04:59.579 --> 05:02.665
And also, well, that was another problem.

05:03.106 --> 05:12.563
But anyway, Byers, the first thing he, amongst the first things he did, he set up a College of Geoscience Faculty Advisory Council.

05:12.663 --> 05:16.190
And I think we were probably the first college to have a faculty council.

05:17.232 --> 05:23.443
And he was quite open about, he could give us assignments and he wanted us to

05:26.528 --> 05:28.670
Oh, just a minute.

05:28.710 --> 05:29.471
Take that off.

05:30.913 --> 05:31.373
Okay.

05:34.256 --> 05:34.837
Yeah, right.

05:34.957 --> 05:37.379
He set up a council.

05:38.741 --> 05:47.910
And in fact, I wrote the first draft of the bylaws for that council and served on it the first few years.

05:49.712 --> 05:54.797
And I think Geosciences was probably the first

05:55.435 --> 06:09.110
college on campus to have substantial faculty participation in faculty issues, as well as issues that affected the college.

06:11.152 --> 06:24.666
The other thing that's very clear to me at the time, the College of Geosciences, particularly oceanography, somewhere along the line I also,

06:26.030 --> 06:32.016
had a dual appointment in oceanography.

06:33.537 --> 06:46.110
And for several years, research-wise, in the summertime, I spent on the ONR research contract that the department had.

06:47.631 --> 06:51.295
And so I knew all the oceanographers very well.

06:51.562 --> 06:56.947
and later participated in some major cruises.

06:56.967 --> 06:58.789
And I'll tell you about one of them in a while.

06:59.569 --> 07:02.893
Let's go back just a second on the dean.

07:03.353 --> 07:15.404
Did you and other faculty members get the impression that Dean Byers had a goal or objectives for geosciences here?

07:15.504 --> 07:19.628
What was he hoping it would become?

07:21.346 --> 07:27.323
Well, all I can speak from is the fact, because he was a quality person,

07:27.607 --> 07:41.987
a quality scientist that he hired quality people here, he would have liked to have seen us become a major player in the U.S., in the earth sciences.

07:43.088 --> 07:46.974
And I have no reason to believe otherwise.

07:47.174 --> 07:53.783
I don't know how the university was able to attract somebody of his quality here.

07:53.982 --> 07:58.529
But he certainly was not going to sit around with a second-rate operation.

07:58.889 --> 08:10.526
And in fact, as you know, he was almost immediately, shortly, moved up as vice president under Rudder before he retired.

08:13.431 --> 08:23.145
Our college, I say our college because I also was a dean later, associate dean later on, was always heavily into research.

08:24.526 --> 08:37.520
Other than those initial people that were here when we first arrived, but already oceanography had some degree of stature and meteorology, some degree of stature.

08:37.740 --> 08:40.884
Who were the high profile?

08:41.625 --> 08:43.387
Leaper in oceanography.

08:43.427 --> 08:44.027
Dale Leaper.

08:45.589 --> 08:52.997
Meteorology, I suppose Vance Moyer, but he was department head then.

08:53.230 --> 08:54.632
Bob Reed?

08:55.053 --> 08:56.936
Bob Reed was the most outstanding.

08:58.117 --> 09:01.462
And in fact, I had some good vibes with Bob.

09:02.784 --> 09:13.440
I originally, when I put together a theoretical course in seismology, much of the mathematics is similar to that that Reed's students.

09:13.941 --> 09:16.605
So his students would come over and take my course.

09:17.952 --> 09:19.935
And that went on for a couple of years.

09:20.135 --> 09:31.233
And we desperately in geophysics needed students from outside because it was hard to find people to enroll in geophysics to start with.

09:32.374 --> 09:38.043
And that went on for a couple of years until geophysics acquired a department head.

09:38.925 --> 09:46.356
The first department head was Spencer.

09:47.737 --> 09:49.021
He came from industry.

09:49.201 --> 09:50.405
Is that Dale Spencer?

09:50.906 --> 09:51.187
No.

09:52.030 --> 09:52.371
Terry.

09:52.611 --> 09:53.695
Terry Spencer.

09:54.316 --> 09:56.142
Terry came from industry.

09:58.549 --> 10:00.615
And...

10:02.165 --> 10:09.092
He really was not, he's a good researcher, but he was not cut out to be a department head.

10:12.035 --> 10:24.749
He sat behind closed doors and worked hard on his courses, took over the theoretical seismology, made it so difficult that oceanography students no longer took it.

10:25.770 --> 10:27.632
That I found irritating.

10:28.726 --> 10:42.045
Although, you know, I'm a friend of Terry's, but he should have come as a faculty member, but not been an administrator.

10:45.770 --> 10:47.673
What were, let's see, what happened?

10:47.713 --> 10:50.116
Let me tell you about the 64 crews.

10:50.136 --> 10:50.517
Okay.

10:52.800 --> 10:56.185
My research, I was able to get some stuff going with

10:57.262 --> 11:01.773
my colleagues up at SCAS, Southwest Center for Advanced Studies.

11:02.855 --> 11:10.714
I had the ship, or access to the ship, at least I thought so, and they had

11:11.673 --> 11:20.909
facilities and equipment, field equipment, sauna buoys, types of things that I did not have access to.

11:20.989 --> 11:33.090
And being a new young professor, my chances of being effective in that, trying to teach full-time and trying to develop a program, I needed help.

11:33.796 --> 11:45.013
And so we did have a couple joint cruises, one in the Gulf of Mexico and one to the Caribbean, down the Cayman Trough area.

11:45.033 --> 12:01.818
And on that cruise, it was designed to look at the crustal structure in the vicinity of the Cayman Trough, which is a fracture zone south of the Cayman.

12:01.838 --> 12:03.060
It extends from

12:03.209 --> 12:15.187
the Oriente Deep south of the eastern end of Cuba all the way to Guatemala, big deep trough, 7,000 meters south of the Cayman Islands.

12:16.849 --> 12:18.051
Little was known about it.

12:19.233 --> 12:26.463
And the crews, we had Southwest Center SCAS provided the sonoboys.

12:28.126 --> 12:30.870
We were also able to borrow a sea gravimeter.

12:32.065 --> 12:33.566
and a magnetometer.

12:34.367 --> 12:41.053
It measured magnetic field variations and gravity variations due to the geologic structures.

12:41.993 --> 12:51.422
And participating in that cruise was Ken Graham from South Africa, a bearded sole.

12:52.302 --> 13:01.330
John Reitzel, one of my old friends from Woods Hole who did heat flow measurements, a bearded sole.

13:02.896 --> 13:16.618
Another scientist from Rhodesia who had come to this country, the reason for these South Africans is Anton Hales,

13:17.172 --> 13:26.667
was the director of the Earth Science Group at SCAS, and he had been director of the Bernard Price Institute of Geophysics in South Africa.

13:27.408 --> 13:30.492
He was a world-renowned geophysicist.

13:30.532 --> 13:40.728
He had done his dissertation under Sir Harold Jeffries in England, and I don't know if you would know of Sir Harold, but he was, okay.

13:41.189 --> 13:43.973
So anyway, these

13:43.953 --> 13:59.448
all these individuals, and we often do our work in the Caribbean, and we were able to get a full-page spread in the Sunday wrote a reviewer section of the Houston paper, the Post, I think.

14:00.750 --> 14:07.977
And all of these individuals, there's a picture of me, and there's Ken Graham, and John Wright, so on and so forth, and they're all bearded, except me.

14:10.059 --> 14:12.441
I came back to A&M,

14:15.037 --> 14:16.459
I'd been gone for three weeks.

14:19.244 --> 14:21.287
I had doubled up classes and so forth.

14:21.307 --> 14:25.334
I walked into the department's head, and I said, did you see that spread?

14:25.894 --> 14:27.036
Oh, yes.

14:27.056 --> 14:28.799
I thought I'd get a pat on the back.

14:30.181 --> 14:30.983
What did I get?

14:32.645 --> 14:34.028
Good thing you didn't have a beard.

14:35.750 --> 14:39.897
So that tells you a little bit about the culture.

14:43.032 --> 14:44.958
It was a conservative place.

14:46.282 --> 14:46.784
Oh, boy.

14:47.867 --> 14:48.108
Right.

14:52.160 --> 14:56.333
I think that also in the community.

14:57.325 --> 15:04.995
Now, there was some salvation for me in the sense that there was already a liberal religious group here.

15:05.055 --> 15:06.938
The Unitarian Fellowship existed.

15:07.779 --> 15:10.843
It was made up, really started by oceanography people.

15:11.604 --> 15:16.751
And I had been a founding member of a Unitarian Fellowship in Woods Hole.

15:17.692 --> 15:21.757
So, in that sense, I had some people that I could talk to.

15:22.679 --> 15:23.520
Describe that.

15:23.540 --> 15:26.083
Did you become a part of the Unitarian group here?

15:26.570 --> 15:27.091
Yeah, sure.

15:27.111 --> 15:28.672
Describe that group at that time.

15:31.376 --> 15:35.841
I can't remember whether Syed had already belonged to it.

15:36.041 --> 15:39.565
It was a small group, probably about 15 people.

15:42.809 --> 15:49.036
When I first started going to their meetings, they were meeting in the Hillel building.

15:50.778 --> 15:55.243
And in terms of religious thinking,

15:55.713 --> 16:01.800
The Unitarians are generally, you pretty much think whatever you want to think.

16:02.981 --> 16:03.922
We don't have a creed.

16:05.244 --> 16:19.780
We do, I think, have, we're not necessarily all agnostics, or what our interpretation is, but we certainly are far removed from the Baptist community.

16:20.654 --> 16:27.707
And traditionally, Unitarians have been involved heavily in social service.

16:29.269 --> 16:32.776
Other people, the Fricksells, you know, the Fricksells.

16:33.136 --> 16:35.460
And I don't know when they first came here.

16:35.500 --> 16:38.926
I don't know if they were already members or not.

16:39.007 --> 16:40.910
Platt, Bill Platt.

16:41.271 --> 16:42.072
You know Bill Platt?

16:43.283 --> 16:46.087
Bill and Shirley were members.

16:46.107 --> 16:53.739
So in that sense, I had a comfortable group that I could interact with.

16:53.759 --> 16:56.002
You all met once a week?

16:56.103 --> 16:56.463
Yeah.

16:56.784 --> 16:57.204
When?

16:57.224 --> 16:58.286
On Sunday mornings.

16:59.628 --> 17:04.235
And eventually, of course, they now have a minister.

17:04.415 --> 17:07.660
But we've gone through many years of lay leadership.

17:09.082 --> 17:12.227
Who were the key lay leaders in those first years?

17:12.393 --> 17:13.758
I don't even remember their name.

17:13.859 --> 17:22.875
I don't remember the fellow that got me interested because he then had gone to, well, wait a minute.

17:28.660 --> 17:35.406
an oceanography professor that's a chemist and then went to South Florida.

17:35.427 --> 17:36.187
I've forgotten.

17:38.269 --> 17:39.430
His wife's name's Ann.

17:39.450 --> 17:41.552
I just don't remember.

17:42.053 --> 17:51.442
Did you encounter some people either on campus or off who thought that you were highly liberal by participating in such a group?

17:52.083 --> 17:54.685
I've never

17:55.930 --> 18:02.318
I'm sure some people thought that, but nobody ever made it uncomfortable for me.

18:02.879 --> 18:14.134
Now, in the local community, I came from a tradition, and my wife did, of small town meetings.

18:15.335 --> 18:20.402
And, for example, in Woods Hole, Falmouth, we had

18:20.568 --> 18:28.118
town meeting representative government, we had a representative for each 50 members of the community, and you knew who it was.

18:29.280 --> 18:39.353
When we came here, one of the first things my wife did was go down to City Hall in Bryan and ask for a city report.

18:40.278 --> 18:48.811
Now, in Falmouth, every year you get a report of all, in fact, you know what everybody's taxes are.

18:50.975 --> 18:52.838
They never heard of such a thing here.

18:56.824 --> 18:59.468
We soon found out that this community

18:59.937 --> 19:05.386
is that a few of the older families really make all the decisions.

19:05.506 --> 19:19.729
Now, it's not that they deliberately avoiding democratic... I mean, they think they're doing the best for the community, and they really do want to, but it's not democratic.

19:20.570 --> 19:25.658
And so that was a time when...

19:25.638 --> 19:30.803
They were also talking about revising the city charter, the Bryan City Charter.

19:31.383 --> 19:40.191
And I can remember going to a meeting, a public meeting, and I'd forgotten what the issue was.

19:41.493 --> 19:51.942
My wife, say, speaking up, and then we were both being denounced as communists publicly in the community, communists.

19:51.962 --> 19:52.843
The other...

19:53.853 --> 20:04.705
reaction I had in those early years is I had two children born here.

20:05.106 --> 20:10.372
I mean, and so I had five children go to school here.

20:10.592 --> 20:15.057
And I was considering running for school board.

20:16.199 --> 20:17.380
I was considering.

20:17.545 --> 20:21.091
And I discussed that with Jim Smith.

20:21.853 --> 20:33.754
I don't know whether you know Jim and Edna, but I can remember Edna and Jim were involved in Democratic politics in the community.

20:33.774 --> 20:37.721
Now, if you came from New England, you were a middle-of-the-road Republican.

20:37.781 --> 20:41.207
When you got here, you were a liberal Democrat.

20:41.187 --> 20:41.868
Right?

20:41.888 --> 20:43.672
Okay?

20:44.293 --> 20:45.456
And they laughed at me.

20:45.576 --> 20:51.808
They said, first of all, you're a university professor.

20:53.392 --> 20:55.055
Second of all, you're a Unitarian.

20:56.337 --> 21:01.107
Third of all, you're a damn Yankee.

21:01.127 --> 21:03.111
And 15 years later,

21:03.884 --> 21:09.149
after arriving here, somebody told me, Dave, you're no longer a damn Yankee, you're just a Yankee.

21:11.992 --> 21:17.118
So those years community-wise were bleak.

21:17.138 --> 21:22.383
Now one thing I didn't, I said when I came here, I didn't ask the right questions.

21:23.224 --> 21:27.228
One of the questions I should have asked, can you employ my wife on campus?

21:27.408 --> 21:29.250
My wife had a degree in physics.

21:29.838 --> 21:35.427
She worked for two electronic companies in Boston.

21:37.651 --> 21:40.115
She was very good mathematics.

21:40.135 --> 21:45.584
She was very good at taking a physicist's paper, converting it into language for an engineer.

21:46.686 --> 21:49.450
And when she was at Woods Hole, she was able to work on a project.

21:50.031 --> 21:52.756
When she came here, she couldn't work.

21:52.776 --> 21:55.440
Now, for somebody that has an intellectual bent,

21:56.416 --> 21:57.818
That was pretty devastating.

21:59.000 --> 22:06.192
And it took her two or three years to get involved in the initial studies of the League of Women Voters here.

22:07.234 --> 22:13.945
But just before she died, she had been thinking about going to law school in Austin.

22:15.066 --> 22:16.449
We were going to try to work that out.

22:17.150 --> 22:20.415
So that certainly was a negative here.

22:20.716 --> 22:32.658
All right, back in the department, when did you and your colleagues begin to think that geophysics specifically and geosciences generally was making real progress?

22:32.678 --> 22:34.241
What were some big steps?

22:34.542 --> 22:41.475
Okay, the big steps, I would think that

22:43.936 --> 22:49.844
The biggest step was when Earl Cook went out and brought the group from Shell here.

22:52.567 --> 22:53.168
The research.

22:53.708 --> 22:55.791
Now, was he the dean at that time?

22:56.312 --> 22:57.033
He must have been.

22:57.694 --> 23:01.799
I'm confused now, trying to remember the sequence because.

23:02.119 --> 23:03.421
Well, he fought when Byers moved.

23:03.441 --> 23:06.945
Let's put off the record here a minute.

23:06.965 --> 23:07.206
All right.

23:07.586 --> 23:08.007
Okay.

23:11.371 --> 23:13.774
The Shell.

23:14.024 --> 23:17.149
in Houston that had a major research lab.

23:17.250 --> 23:22.158
I would have compared it with the Bell Labs, for example, in the area of earth sciences.

23:23.100 --> 23:29.451
And the parent shell company decided that they didn't want any more of this

23:30.578 --> 23:36.304
only directed research at their specific research problems, no more general rock mechanics and so forth.

23:37.245 --> 23:55.843
And so the college put together with the blessing, I guess, of the university, Earl Cook put together a package that brought John Handen, let's see, John Logan, Mel Friedman,

23:56.279 --> 24:13.022
George Sauer, Dave Stearns, all five people from the Shell Rock Mechanics Group moved en masse to A&M to form what became a research center for tectonophysics.

24:13.559 --> 24:26.035
which in my view became an outstanding example of what a research center should do in terms of students coming up through the mill and so forth and so on.

24:27.277 --> 24:37.551
The other interesting thing is that some years later, the one member of the group from Shell who did not come here was Neville Carter.

24:38.612 --> 24:42.317
He went on to New York Sunnybrook

24:43.681 --> 24:52.675
But he later became the person that I believe is the one that put geophysics on the national scene.

24:52.735 --> 24:57.362
I mean, that really, he replaced Terry Spencer.

24:58.023 --> 24:58.824
As the department head?

24:59.425 --> 25:03.190
Well, there was an interim there, Tony Kanji for a year, I think.

25:03.711 --> 25:08.178
And then Neville Carter came from Stony Brook to become department head.

25:08.258 --> 25:12.304
And he's a good scientist and a hell of a good administrator.

25:13.212 --> 25:18.407
Now, where did research funding come from during those developing years?

25:22.319 --> 25:25.568
Let's talk about tectonophysics really

25:26.273 --> 25:31.880
suddenly made us at least a semi-mecca for people to visit.

25:31.900 --> 25:35.985
And their funding came primarily from the Department of Defense.

25:36.546 --> 25:38.328
It came from NSF.

25:38.348 --> 25:40.170
They were very successful in funding.

25:40.751 --> 25:53.327
Now, geophysics, again, some of our funding came from ONR, from the

25:53.307 --> 26:02.082
National Science Foundation primarily, and Department of Defense supported some activities.

26:02.542 --> 26:08.312
And then there was a lot of, not big grants, but small grants from petroleum.

26:08.748 --> 26:14.397
But very little from within the university or the state budget.

26:14.417 --> 26:14.998
That's right.

26:15.759 --> 26:16.260
That's right.

26:16.620 --> 26:17.962
We didn't have any built in.

26:19.164 --> 26:32.084
And of course, I think that in some ways we were a little bit jealous of some people, for example, in agriculture who had built in resources.

26:32.225 --> 26:36.932
Because I think we were the first college that really competed

26:36.912 --> 26:39.775
for national funds from people like NSF.

26:40.315 --> 26:49.325
Now I speak about the college because this was oceanography and geophysics and geology and meteorology.

26:51.006 --> 26:59.575
And, you know, eventually they brought the ocean drilling project here.

27:00.456 --> 27:02.498
Now the new

27:03.203 --> 27:05.847
Oceanography Meteorology Tower Building.

27:06.468 --> 27:07.429
Yes.

27:07.449 --> 27:09.612
When does it come into play?

27:10.273 --> 27:10.654
Boy.

27:11.956 --> 27:13.678
It was under Earl Cook, wasn't it?

27:14.359 --> 27:15.141
I'm not sure.

27:15.201 --> 27:15.581
Let's see.

27:16.322 --> 27:17.785
It used to be over in Bazell.

27:18.325 --> 27:23.152
Oceanography Meteorology was in Bazell and in Goodwin.

27:24.795 --> 27:28.941
And I guess Goodwin was held together by

27:29.123 --> 27:31.445
steel straps here and there.

27:33.047 --> 27:36.971
And I'm sure it must have been under Earl Cook.

27:36.991 --> 27:40.674
Where was the dean's office located physically?

27:42.796 --> 27:43.057
Boy.

27:43.377 --> 27:44.578
Was it over in one of those?

27:45.179 --> 27:46.560
No, wait a minute.

27:46.580 --> 27:47.181
Wait a minute.

27:48.161 --> 27:50.904
It was in Halbooty for a while.

27:50.924 --> 27:52.085
It was in what is now Halbooty?

27:52.105 --> 27:52.626
Yeah.

27:53.066 --> 27:54.928
And what did you all call that building then?

27:56.326 --> 27:57.767
Geology building?

27:57.787 --> 27:59.569
Geology building, as far as I know.

27:59.609 --> 28:07.978
Now, somewhere along the line there, I can remember they finally air conditioned the building.

28:09.039 --> 28:16.586
And of course, in the process, they put in a drop ceiling that hid a lot of those marvelous moldings and so forth.

28:16.646 --> 28:25.135
Because that building was designed the three major geologic

28:25.115 --> 28:27.418
eras.

28:27.439 --> 28:34.589
And somewhere along there, the facings on the tower, facing blocks were loose.

28:34.609 --> 28:42.962
And there was a big debate about that tower had those beautiful tiles.

28:43.042 --> 28:44.885
It was shaped like a topaz crystal.

28:46.788 --> 28:53.518
And when the facing blocks started to loosen up,

28:54.123 --> 28:58.696
The engineers decided, I guess, it was not cost effective.

28:58.736 --> 29:03.951
They would have had to take the blocks off and re-cement them to the building.

29:04.432 --> 29:07.120
And instead, they decided to take the tower down.

29:08.517 --> 29:15.946
And that, we went through a whole spring with jackhammers going outside.

29:16.026 --> 29:18.389
They would not find us classrooms elsewhere.

29:18.449 --> 29:22.954
And it was like torment.

29:22.974 --> 29:26.398
It was like torment.

29:26.418 --> 29:32.145
Do you remember in those early years any missed opportunities?

29:33.239 --> 29:37.653
Yes.

29:38.716 --> 29:47.063
When I got to A&M, we had been given a set of instruments as part of the worldwide seismic net.

29:48.359 --> 29:56.832
And these three low-frequency seismomas, three higher frequency.

29:58.074 --> 30:04.424
And our responsibility was to set up a vault to put these instruments in.

30:04.484 --> 30:08.410
This was supported

30:08.390 --> 30:09.711
put together by DOA.

30:09.791 --> 30:16.518
This is part of the worldwide net with one emphasis being nuclear detection.

30:18.459 --> 30:23.904
And one of the things they asked me as I arrived essentially, where would I put it?

30:25.506 --> 30:36.276
Well, I may have made the wrong decision in terms of student participation, but not in terms of a seismically viable site.

30:36.456 --> 30:37.637
We put it out.

30:38.393 --> 30:40.396
at the facility out in Junction.

30:42.460 --> 30:43.461
And it's in the hillside.

30:43.501 --> 30:46.486
We built a vault back into the hillside.

30:47.267 --> 30:53.257
And it turned out it was one of probably the top one or two quietest stations in the U.S.

30:54.318 --> 30:55.661
for earthquake detection.

30:56.782 --> 31:00.929
And a guy named Mr. Parrott ran the A&M facilities out there.

31:01.069 --> 31:05.937
And we had a person that changed the records each day and so forth.

31:07.317 --> 31:17.934
And the records used to come to A&M, and I would do some annotation, and then we'd send them on, and then they'd send them back after the government had recorded them.

31:20.878 --> 31:23.702
Terry Spencer was department head at the time.

31:23.723 --> 31:31.114
Somewhere in there, the community in...
