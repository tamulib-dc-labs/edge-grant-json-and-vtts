WEBVTT

00:02.900 --> 00:03.401
There it goes.

00:03.442 --> 00:03.943
There it goes.

00:06.009 --> 00:07.172
We're testing, testing.

00:07.352 --> 00:08.516
One, two, three, four.

00:09.478 --> 00:10.762
One, two, three, four.

00:10.782 --> 00:13.008
I guess we're all in line then.

00:13.449 --> 00:16.217
This is March the 6th, I believe.

00:17.750 --> 00:33.368
And we're March 5th over on Berkeley Street in the study of Dr. Alva Niles to try to record some of his memories of his years of service here at Texas A&M.

00:34.309 --> 00:41.918
Alva, would you describe growing up, background, family, where'd you go to college?

00:42.472 --> 00:44.835
Tell your story before you got to College Station.

00:44.895 --> 00:49.139
Introduce yourself to anyone that might listen to this tape or read it.

00:49.159 --> 00:49.580
Oh, okay.

00:51.102 --> 00:55.427
I was born in Arizona in Flagstaff.

00:55.447 --> 00:59.211
My dad was a park ranger at Grand Canyon.

00:59.231 --> 01:11.044
But he was a native New Mexican, and we went back to Taos, and that's where I grew up as a boy through high school or at least through the 11th grade.

01:11.480 --> 01:21.273
Dad was a, had been a cowboy, a truck driver, a store, operated a grocery store.

01:22.675 --> 01:27.442
In later years of his life, he was a warehouseman for the U.S.

01:27.522 --> 01:28.383
Forest Service.

01:29.885 --> 01:39.478
Then he spent the last 20 years, I suppose, roughly, as a manager of a building products company in Taos.

01:41.635 --> 02:01.564
I graduated from high school in Santa Fe, actually, because Dad had gone to work with the engineers when they were building Los Alamos in 1942, I suppose, somewhere along in there.

02:03.807 --> 02:07.693
And that really was the last time I lived with my family.

02:09.007 --> 02:14.815
I spent a couple of summers working with the Forest Service on forest road projects.

02:16.197 --> 02:19.301
Enrolled in New Mexico State at that time.

02:21.003 --> 02:25.229
Finished one semester and volunteered and went to the service with the Navy.

02:26.450 --> 02:28.393
That would have been in 1943.

02:28.874 --> 02:35.082
And I was discharged from there in

02:35.483 --> 02:39.768
2006, resumed my education at New Mexico State.

02:40.950 --> 02:42.512
Graduated there in 49.

02:44.634 --> 02:49.820
Went on to Oklahoma A&M to work on an MS degree.

02:50.661 --> 02:51.322
Majoring in?

02:51.683 --> 02:54.246
Majoring in agronomy in both cases.

02:56.428 --> 02:58.050
Finished up there in 1950.

02:59.872 --> 03:03.617
Went back to New Mexico State as an instructor in agronomy.

03:04.677 --> 03:17.115
barely became acquainted with my class, and the Navy came and got me for recall during the Korean conflict.

03:17.135 --> 03:28.431
After that, then, discharged from there, went back to Oklahoma, working at the Oklahoma Cotton Research Station in Chickasha.

03:29.853 --> 03:33.739
Spent two years, then came to College Station,

03:34.597 --> 03:41.667
to work in cotton breeding and to do academic work toward a PhD.

03:42.849 --> 03:47.235
How did you and A&M know about each other?

03:49.538 --> 03:56.207
Primarily through people I had met professionally in the cotton industry, primarily.

03:56.528 --> 03:57.049
Such as?

03:57.069 --> 04:02.376
Dr. Tom Richmond would be the main one, Dr. Charlie Lewis,

04:03.031 --> 04:04.373
LEWIS?

04:04.933 --> 04:06.555
LEWIS, who lives in Bryan.

04:07.837 --> 04:09.359
Those are the main ones, I guess.

04:09.939 --> 04:13.003
And I came here primarily to work with Richmond.

04:13.764 --> 04:18.810
He was the professor and officer in charge of the Cotton Research Program.

04:19.591 --> 04:22.635
Did you, did they find you or did you find them?

04:24.217 --> 04:24.818
I found them.

04:25.659 --> 04:27.481
Did you write to them or talk to them or both?

04:27.601 --> 04:28.262
I wrote to them.

04:29.373 --> 04:36.305
And I had become acquainted with him at a meeting in Biloxi, first professional meeting I ever went to.

04:37.928 --> 04:43.197
And it worked out that they were in the market for someone in their program.

04:44.479 --> 04:47.484
So we moved down here in the summer of 1953.

04:49.027 --> 04:50.790
Not going to ask you money many times.

04:51.391 --> 04:53.575
What was that first compensation?

04:53.960 --> 04:54.781
When you first came?

04:54.801 --> 05:00.286
Thirty, I can dig that out.

05:00.446 --> 05:01.848
I think it was about $3,600.

05:01.908 --> 05:03.449
For 12 months.

05:03.530 --> 05:04.270
For 12 months.

05:04.651 --> 05:08.494
And as far as you knew, what were your responsibilities, your duties?

05:10.296 --> 05:14.220
I was an assistant, I titled as an assistant agronomist.

05:16.342 --> 05:18.304
I'm sorry, an assistant professor.

05:20.286 --> 05:23.089
Working solely in research in the cotton program.

05:24.689 --> 05:27.593
under the tutelage of Dr. T.R.

05:27.613 --> 05:28.033
Richmond.

05:28.053 --> 05:30.156
He was my mentor primarily.

05:31.178 --> 05:37.766
People like Richmond and Lewis, Maida Brown, those are the ones that I knew initially the best.

05:38.888 --> 05:40.890
So I grew up professionally.

05:40.971 --> 05:43.434
I grew up here at Texas A&M.

05:44.575 --> 05:51.945
As far as you knew at that point, what kind of status did A&M's research program have in cotton?

05:54.018 --> 05:58.384
It was one of the major players internationally in Cotton.

05:58.904 --> 06:03.470
Who else was competitive with them?

06:03.551 --> 06:22.776
Mississippi State in a certain way, Arkansas to a limited extent, California, University of California, University of Arizona, North Carolina State was a major player.

06:23.363 --> 06:43.891
The cotton program here at that time probably had the broadest range of disciplinarians, all the way from very basic research with Maida Brown and Margaret Menzel on up through people like Richmond, Fred Elliott, who was an extension.

06:45.093 --> 06:49.939
So it ran the gamut from very, very basic to applied.

06:50.860 --> 06:52.763
And I was in an applied

06:53.485 --> 06:54.767
cotton breeding program.

06:54.847 --> 06:57.150
Those were my responsibilities.

06:57.170 --> 06:57.370
All right.

06:57.390 --> 07:00.133
And so you and your wife moved down here from?

07:00.894 --> 07:01.595
From Chickasha.

07:01.675 --> 07:02.316
Chickasha.

07:03.618 --> 07:04.379
What did you bring?

07:04.859 --> 07:05.740
Describe the move.

07:05.760 --> 07:06.742
What did you bring with you?

07:07.603 --> 07:09.185
We didn't have much to bring with us.

07:09.725 --> 07:11.347
We didn't even own an automobile.

07:14.111 --> 07:16.394
We came down here on a bus.

07:16.414 --> 07:16.774
Really?

07:17.075 --> 07:19.017
So you brought things in suitcases?

07:19.037 --> 07:19.558
Mainly.

07:19.798 --> 07:22.902
You know, we had a few things, but not a great deal.

07:23.793 --> 07:25.134
Did you have some furniture shipped?

07:26.856 --> 07:27.336
Not much.

07:28.297 --> 07:29.858
We had been very transient.

07:30.359 --> 07:33.021
Where did you end up living when you first got here?

07:33.041 --> 07:44.151
When we first lived here, moved here, we lived on Edgemore in Bryan in a house that belonged to a veterinarian.

07:44.171 --> 07:48.435
We lived there two years and then built the house on Bolton.

07:48.995 --> 07:53.479
What did the Edgemere, what was the rent, do you remember?

07:54.505 --> 07:57.069
Oh, no, I can't remember that far back.

07:58.352 --> 08:00.816
All right, you built the house on Bolton.

08:01.177 --> 08:03.601
Do you remember the cost of the lot and or the house?

08:04.182 --> 08:11.054
The lot and the house were somewhere on the order of 13,000 as nearly as I can remember.

08:13.438 --> 08:18.707
And what else was there in that neighborhood in Eastgate then?

08:18.890 --> 08:21.494
Was that the only house on the street, just about?

08:22.455 --> 08:27.302
Ours was probably the third or fourth house on that street.

08:29.706 --> 08:33.671
Most of the Eastgate populace were down on Milner.

08:35.194 --> 08:36.315
What's that next street?

08:37.317 --> 08:39.079
There were two of them there primarily.

08:39.119 --> 08:40.762
Those were older homes.

08:41.763 --> 08:47.952
That's where many of the teaching staff, A&M staff, lived there then.

08:48.235 --> 08:51.880
So, and then some up along Walton Drive.

08:53.283 --> 08:58.470
So, Bolton was an offshoot of that and those were all new homes in there at that time.

08:59.231 --> 09:02.797
Describe the agronomy department when you arrived.

09:03.418 --> 09:05.220
Who was it and where was it?

09:05.280 --> 09:06.943
What facilities did it have?

09:08.806 --> 09:13.673
At that time, Jim Adams was the head of the department.

09:15.315 --> 09:17.078
The department was housed

09:18.003 --> 09:23.990
mostly in what was known as the old Experiment Station building.

09:25.411 --> 09:38.226
And the building next to it, and I don't remember the name of that, the old red brick building, that's where the soil labs, the chemistry labs were located.

09:39.207 --> 09:41.850
The other building that I was in

09:42.235 --> 09:48.062
housed all of the crops people, as I recall, and most of the extension staff.

09:49.665 --> 09:55.652
It was a very handy thing because ours was a half-basement office.

09:55.672 --> 09:58.296
I could park right outside my window.

09:59.297 --> 10:01.079
Now, you said you all didn't bring a car, though.

10:01.159 --> 10:03.042
How soon before you bought a car?

10:03.642 --> 10:08.749
Our first car, gosh, I don't remember.

10:09.708 --> 10:17.136
I would guess somewhere around 1953 or 54, let's see.

10:17.176 --> 10:25.986
We came in 53, we were without an automobile for at least a couple of years.

10:26.287 --> 10:27.027
How did you get around?

10:28.930 --> 10:33.775
Well, there was a little bus service at that time, and we were living there just off of

10:34.075 --> 10:36.137
Texas Avenue, and we could use that.

10:36.697 --> 10:38.759
So you, you, you caught a, you rode a bus?

10:38.779 --> 10:40.321
Yeah, I rode a bus, yeah.

10:40.341 --> 10:42.082
Do you remember what the fare, what it cost?

10:43.003 --> 10:44.384
See, I didn't, I didn't know about this.

10:44.444 --> 10:45.505
No, gosh, no.

10:45.785 --> 10:47.047
I can remember the bus driver.

10:47.507 --> 10:49.068
I can see his face still.

10:49.969 --> 10:53.332
It was an old school bus type vehicle.

10:53.953 --> 10:57.636
It ran to town and ran to A&M, and I could catch it.

10:57.656 --> 11:00.599
What was it like to be a newcomer in those days?

11:00.659 --> 11:02.040
How were newcomers treated?

11:05.530 --> 11:15.045
Well, as I recall, there was a newcomer's club which catered mainly to the females, to the wives.

11:15.666 --> 11:16.988
They sort of took care of those.

11:17.769 --> 11:25.261
I didn't get involved in much of that because I was just busy, you know, trying to learn my trade.

11:25.522 --> 11:30.069
But the fact that you were not a native Texan and had not gone to A&M, did that ever?

11:30.389 --> 11:30.590
No.

11:31.551 --> 11:32.112
No.

11:33.003 --> 11:35.045
Oh, I used to get joshed about it a little bit.

11:35.405 --> 11:39.229
But no, that was never any hindrance in any way.

11:39.249 --> 11:42.852
And in the department, who were the major leaders?

11:44.413 --> 11:48.637
Dr. John Rogers, who still lives here in Bryan.

11:52.621 --> 11:53.382
George Kunze.

11:55.363 --> 11:59.167
What was George, what was Dean Kunze, wasn't Dean at then, what was his specialty?

11:59.187 --> 12:01.609
George was over in soil physics or

12:02.618 --> 12:04.582
either soil physics or soil chemistry.

12:05.504 --> 12:06.546
I think soil physics.

12:07.688 --> 12:14.080
Then he moved on and Morris Bloodworth moved up here from Westlaco.

12:14.100 --> 12:21.114
So Morris Bloodworth was the department head I knew best during the years I was here.

12:22.076 --> 12:23.158
When did he take over?

12:25.197 --> 12:26.279
I can't answer that.

12:26.319 --> 12:27.581
It would be a wild guess.

12:28.102 --> 12:33.651
I'd say it's probably early 60s, somewhere along there.

12:33.671 --> 12:38.238
Because Rogers succeeded Adams as department head.

12:38.278 --> 12:45.249
Then Rogers went off with ASGRO, seed company.

12:45.590 --> 12:46.892
Oh, A-S.

12:47.313 --> 12:49.055
A-S-G-R-O-W.

12:50.698 --> 12:52.521
And that is when...

12:55.117 --> 13:01.447
No, Bloodworth was over in soils, and then Bloodworth moved into the department.

13:02.108 --> 13:05.894
Did the department have sections, like soil?

13:05.954 --> 13:07.156
Yes, yes.

13:07.437 --> 13:17.813
There was cotton investigations, corn investigations, miscellaneous crops, small grains.

13:19.977 --> 13:22.761
Those are the ones I recall right off the top of my head.

13:23.197 --> 13:37.798
When you first arrived, did anybody, either in a comparatively formal way or even very informally, did they give you any advice as a newcomer?

13:38.439 --> 13:44.648
Here's what we are doing, here's what you ought to do, here's... Yeah, I was...

13:45.843 --> 13:46.784
What was that advice?

13:46.804 --> 13:54.957
I was indoctrinated in what the program was, and through my contacts, nothing programmed.

13:55.578 --> 13:55.678
Okay.

13:56.119 --> 13:58.162
But Richmond was a good teacher.

13:59.444 --> 14:14.247
He believed very strongly in giving a fellow the outline of his responsibilities, what they were, his job, his obligations, and turn them loose.

14:15.239 --> 14:16.440
You proved yourself.

14:17.201 --> 14:18.703
That was his basic philosophy.

14:20.265 --> 14:26.833
Were there some other young, new members like you at that time?

14:29.756 --> 14:29.977
Uh-huh.

14:29.997 --> 14:32.780
In our group, no.

14:32.800 --> 14:35.844
I was the youngster.

14:35.864 --> 14:40.369
And it was clear, correct me if I'm wrong, it was clear

14:40.619 --> 14:48.507
to you and everyone else that you were a member of the professional group, but you were also going to be working on your doctoral degree?

14:49.748 --> 14:49.848
Yeah.

14:49.868 --> 14:50.008
Okay.

14:50.028 --> 14:54.413
We, at that time, we were allowed to take one course a semester.

14:55.754 --> 14:58.276
And I think maybe a course during the summer.

14:58.997 --> 15:05.544
So it took me, see, I had to wait a year to establish residency before I could enroll.

15:06.444 --> 15:09.107
So that took five years.

15:09.897 --> 15:13.102
And I finished up my degree then in 1959.

15:15.225 --> 15:18.270
And what was your, describe your specific research?

15:19.652 --> 15:28.607
My specific research was initially to handle the applied cotton breeding program.

15:29.929 --> 15:33.474
I did that for about three or four years.

15:35.437 --> 15:37.761
That's when I really learned my,

15:38.618 --> 15:39.981
my job and my science.

15:42.104 --> 15:42.986
Mr. D.T.

15:43.066 --> 15:52.484
Killow at that time was elderly, and he retired and had been running the cotton variety evaluation program in the state of Texas.

15:53.846 --> 15:57.032
And I was asked to take that on, which I did.

15:58.210 --> 16:10.176
That broadened my contacts considerably because I worked all the way from Wesley Co to El Paso to Lubbock and Plainview, wherever cotton was growing.

16:10.998 --> 16:13.924
So I stayed pretty much in that for several years.

16:14.714 --> 16:17.618
constantly growing a little bit more all the time.

16:18.659 --> 16:24.067
Then ultimately, in 1974, Richmond retired.

16:25.268 --> 16:31.997
Both Richmond and Maida Brown and Fred Elliott, who was my extension counterpart.

16:32.077 --> 16:34.140
We did a lot of work together.

16:34.829 --> 16:43.522
And I sort of moved into the in charge of the cotton breeding program.

16:43.542 --> 16:47.148
Cotton Investigations was the way it was titled.

16:47.168 --> 16:50.433
And that's what I did for the rest of my career here.

16:51.375 --> 16:52.877
And the title of your dissertation?

16:57.023 --> 17:00.128
The title of my dissertation had to do with the

17:00.597 --> 17:19.689
and I can't give you a title, it's just too long ago, had to do with the use of imported African cotton stocks as sources of useful breeding traits in the development of cotton varieties.

17:20.670 --> 17:23.956
And summarize what you found in that research.

17:23.996 --> 17:24.797
Not a great deal.

17:24.857 --> 17:25.879
That was very useful.

17:26.686 --> 17:32.053
But it was exotic germplasm that needed to be screened and evaluated.

17:32.633 --> 17:42.466
And that's what I did through a series of controlled hybridizations and then testing out the progeny from those.

17:42.866 --> 17:44.268
And where did you do that research?

17:44.528 --> 17:45.109
I did it here.

17:46.130 --> 17:46.731
All here?

17:46.751 --> 17:47.592
All of that was here.

17:48.073 --> 17:52.478
And is, is, how much of that was laboratory and how much of it was field?

17:54.701 --> 17:56.423
It was basically all field.

17:57.297 --> 18:04.406
The only laboratory part of that would have been in the assessment of fiber properties.

18:04.806 --> 18:11.675
And that was done, actually, at Texas Tech, because that's where the lab was that we used.

18:11.695 --> 18:26.173
Now, in effect, did you attempt to cross some of those varieties with some of our... We used some of our local material as test varieties.

18:26.153 --> 18:31.818
and then combined those with series, as I recall, eight different African germplasm stocks.

18:32.339 --> 18:35.382
Where in Africa geographically did it come from?

18:35.402 --> 18:47.773
Most of those came out of Uganda from a man named Hutchison, who was a very well-respected and renowned cotton botanist, an Englishman.

18:48.494 --> 18:51.857
Was cotton grown in large quantities in Africa then?

18:51.897 --> 18:52.157
Yes.

18:52.738 --> 18:53.038
Really?

18:53.058 --> 18:55.300
And Uganda was a major player in that.

18:56.512 --> 19:08.762
They had a huge research program in the Uganda at that time, up until, I mean, Idi Amin, isn't that the one that came in?

19:09.163 --> 19:10.984
Yeah, and he destroyed everything, of course.

19:11.745 --> 19:16.829
And I had an opportunity to visit that station in later years and see what little was left of it.

19:17.670 --> 19:22.834
Now, my wife is from a little town in North Carolina called Mebin.

19:22.854 --> 19:25.877
And one of the young men that came up, grew up there,

19:26.971 --> 19:28.974
from the family for which it's named.

19:29.675 --> 19:33.261
He came to Lockhart, Texas, and his name was pronounced Mebane.

19:34.022 --> 19:34.263
Yep.

19:35.705 --> 19:38.109
And was Mebane cotton still?

19:39.170 --> 19:49.867
Mebane cotton was an old, one of the older varieties in Texas that had really played a very prominent part in the development of the Texas cotton industry.

19:51.750 --> 19:54.835
It had been used a great deal as parental material

19:55.456 --> 19:58.779
in the development of later improved varieties.

19:59.440 --> 20:04.244
Yes, I became acquainted with the Meebane varieties right away.

20:04.605 --> 20:08.688
But was there, and when you got here, was there still a... Oh, yeah.

20:08.708 --> 20:24.383
Oh, it was still identified as... In your doctoral research, that was, though part of the research you were assigned to do,

20:25.240 --> 20:32.129
Describe during those years, those first three, four, five years here, describe your typical routine.

20:33.471 --> 20:41.542
A week, you began a day at what time and stayed until what time, and about how much of the week were you here and how much were you on the road and so forth?

20:41.943 --> 20:45.928
Initially, I was here almost exclusively, very little travel.

20:47.771 --> 20:54.640
Normally, work day nominally was from 8 to 5, but depending on time of the year,

20:55.227 --> 21:12.174
During planting season, during harvest season, when irrigation came along, I can remember working 18, 20 hours a day simply to get things done, particularly when we were really developing irrigation in the Brazos bottom at that time.

21:13.516 --> 21:15.840
And it wasn't very refined.

21:18.144 --> 21:22.230
So normally I went to work somewhere around 7, 7, 15.

21:22.953 --> 21:25.677
And I probably stayed until 5.30 or so.

21:26.377 --> 21:31.324
With a young family, I didn't spend too much time away.

21:31.865 --> 21:38.113
Now, the acreage down in the bottom on which y'all were planting these experimental crops was located where?

21:39.735 --> 21:42.118
On the A&M plantation, which still exists.

21:42.138 --> 21:43.380
South of Highway 60?

21:43.900 --> 21:46.984
Yes, across the bridge on the left.

21:48.446 --> 21:51.390
There is a little A&M land on the right side.

21:51.758 --> 21:57.165
And that basically is where much of my research was done in those fields.

21:57.545 --> 21:57.766
Which?

21:58.487 --> 21:59.628
On the right side of the highway.

21:59.648 --> 22:00.569
On the north side of the highway.

22:00.589 --> 22:01.851
Yeah, on the north side of the highway.

22:02.412 --> 22:08.079
But we also had lands assigned to us back in the larger part of the plantation.

22:08.980 --> 22:11.643
About how many acres did you use?

22:11.663 --> 22:20.955
At that time, I probably altogether had a total of maybe 35 or 40 acres under my immediate supervision.

22:21.560 --> 22:26.729
All right, now, if I'm not mistaken, the 50s, we had some drought conditions in Texas.

22:27.571 --> 22:29.534
How did that affect your work?

22:30.977 --> 22:33.100
Here, not too much.

22:34.543 --> 22:39.472
At that time, I was beginning to travel out in the states, particularly into southern Texas.

22:40.454 --> 22:42.437
I can remember the drought in the...

22:42.923 --> 22:46.070
Nueces County area, Kingsville in there.

22:46.150 --> 22:48.114
I had never seen anything like that.

22:48.635 --> 22:51.200
Describe as much as you can that you remember.

22:51.240 --> 22:53.164
I can remember what we call bumblebee cotton.

22:53.204 --> 22:59.397
It barely got out of the ground and would be 8 to 10 inches tall and maybe it would have one bowl on it.

23:01.857 --> 23:07.784
But I had seen cotton like that in Oklahoma, which was sort of not unusual up there.

23:08.185 --> 23:13.331
What did the farmers and the hired hands do?

23:16.235 --> 23:18.357
Of course, there was less demand for labor.

23:20.280 --> 23:25.526
People associated with the harvesting industry and with the ginning industry suffered a great deal.

23:26.407 --> 23:28.810
There just wasn't any crop to process.

23:29.245 --> 23:38.238
And that extended on through not only the gins but into the compresses and the warehouses all through the marketing system.

23:39.339 --> 23:42.163
And did some of them go broke and close up?

23:46.069 --> 23:48.472
I can't recall any specifically, no.

23:49.214 --> 23:55.843
As far as you're aware, did the acreage, the total Texas acreage in cotton go

23:56.313 --> 23:59.017
down and stay down, or did it come back up?

23:59.037 --> 23:59.697
It came back up.

24:00.418 --> 24:05.025
Did it shift geographically after that?

24:05.165 --> 24:06.847
Well, yeah.

24:06.867 --> 24:18.302
At the time I came here, cotton was really almost out of East Texas, say east of Highway 45, I-45.

24:19.003 --> 24:19.824
There wasn't any.

24:20.625 --> 24:24.210
It was in bad shape in the Texas Blacklands.

24:25.540 --> 24:31.409
It was being replaced with pastures, permanent pastures, grain sorden.

24:32.651 --> 24:43.888
So cotton was moving into the High Plains heavily, into the Lower Rio Grande Valley, into the Pecos area at that time.

24:45.009 --> 24:46.231
Didn't last very long there.

24:46.972 --> 24:49.436
And out in the El Paso area in the High Plains.

24:50.057 --> 24:53.522
Yeah, I saw, I was a witness to those

24:53.738 --> 24:57.762
acreage shifts during the 50s and early 60s.

24:58.403 --> 25:03.308
See, I lived in Garland, Dallas, now Dallas suburb, until I was 10.

25:03.488 --> 25:08.514
It was then 2,000 people and the money crop was cotton.

25:08.614 --> 25:18.885
There were three gins there at that time and the family that everybody most looked to was Ferris Watson.

25:19.169 --> 25:20.891
I know Ferris Watson.

25:21.753 --> 25:24.516
Ferris Watson Seed Company, Garland, Texas.

25:24.677 --> 25:25.137
There you go.

25:26.679 --> 25:26.940
There you go.

25:26.960 --> 25:47.067
And I still show our kids where the gin was and I tell them that as a little kid I remembered that when ginning season came it was a very, very, very nonstop 24 hour day operation and that going to the gin was in my opinion a very masculine place.

25:47.705 --> 25:55.735
that there were lots of good old boys there working hard and telling jokes and teasing each other and pulling pranks and so forth.

25:55.755 --> 26:07.671
And I remember people taking from the gin a kind of a receipt for how much they had ginned and took it to the bank

26:08.225 --> 26:11.269
to clear their note for the year.

26:12.130 --> 26:14.853
And I presume that was not unusual with that town, was it?

26:17.797 --> 26:20.400
How much were you on the road during these years?

26:20.441 --> 26:26.668
You're doing this research as a part of the department's program, but also your district.

26:26.688 --> 26:28.731
How much were you on the road out of town?

26:29.977 --> 26:33.542
Ultimately, probably in the 70s, let's say.

26:33.742 --> 26:34.663
No, back in the 50s.

26:34.683 --> 26:36.225
Oh, in the 50s.

26:38.589 --> 26:42.234
Probably no more than 20, 25 percent of my time.

26:43.415 --> 26:50.685
I was just getting acquainted with the state at that time and developing my research and my contacts out in the state.

26:51.290 --> 26:59.840
That grew ultimately to a time in the 70s when I was out probably 40% of the time.

27:00.261 --> 27:00.401
Okay.

27:00.501 --> 27:09.992
Describe, as you're getting this research program going, describe some of the big steps that you now in hindsight can say, hey, that was something important.

27:10.673 --> 27:19.744
And also, if you can remember any problems you encountered, any stumbles, any goofs, share with any of those.

27:20.399 --> 27:21.280
Lots of goofs.

27:22.422 --> 27:29.530
Those were a matter of no great importance, sort of routine.

27:30.912 --> 27:49.275
In terms of great accomplishments, I think, I feel that my greatest accomplishment professionally was the development of a well-organized variety evaluation program statewide, because that took some doing.

27:50.588 --> 28:00.100
People tended to be a bit provincial at that time, so you had some folks you had to deal with very carefully.

28:00.861 --> 28:02.243
What kind of folks?

28:03.245 --> 28:04.206
Folks in the High Plains.

28:04.366 --> 28:05.848
You mean the farmers?

28:07.230 --> 28:08.371
No.

28:08.391 --> 28:15.300
Yes, farmers, but research people, professional people within the overall organization.

28:16.362 --> 28:19.566
I can recall being told one time,

28:19.917 --> 28:25.768
We really don't need you folks from College Station coming up here telling us how to do our business.

28:27.571 --> 28:31.399
Where were the most important research locations out of College Station?

28:31.419 --> 28:32.902
Lubbock was one of them.

28:33.382 --> 28:34.765
Westlico was another.

28:36.228 --> 28:38.432
In the early days, there was a very important

28:38.902 --> 28:41.344
a USDA station in Greenville.

28:41.865 --> 28:46.249
That was closed up early in probably around 56, 57.

28:46.369 --> 28:49.112
I used to work with them.

28:49.352 --> 28:50.894
I never heard of the one in Greenville.

28:50.914 --> 28:52.215
I'd been there for years.

28:54.717 --> 28:57.841
El Paso, Chillicothe.

29:02.545 --> 29:04.487
There were several other stations that have

29:05.497 --> 29:11.245
in which the program was much less important.

29:11.806 --> 29:15.130
Not important, but certainly not big, you know.

29:15.671 --> 29:16.752
Places like Spur.

29:19.156 --> 29:20.397
Yeah, I went to Spur for years.

29:21.038 --> 29:24.703
All right, now when you would go to one of these locations, you drove?

29:24.683 --> 29:26.786
Yes.

29:26.806 --> 29:29.870
And where did a visiting researcher stay?

29:29.970 --> 29:30.551
In a motel?

29:30.991 --> 29:31.572
In a motel.

29:31.592 --> 29:34.176
There weren't any guest quarters or anything there?

29:34.196 --> 29:34.356
No.

29:34.676 --> 29:41.726
I can't ever recall staying in any guest quarters of any organization, no.

29:42.627 --> 29:49.356
Share some anecdotes about some of the automobile travel problems you recall over the years.

29:49.396 --> 29:51.078
There's got to be some where something went wrong.

29:51.118 --> 29:53.121
I had a good teacher.

29:53.945 --> 29:59.473
Much of my early traveling was done with Fred Elliott, who was the extension cotton specialist.

30:00.054 --> 30:03.980
Fred knew everyone and every place in the cotton business.

30:06.063 --> 30:11.652
I had assigned to me a Chevrolet carryall, I think they called them in.

30:13.214 --> 30:15.117
And that's what I began my travels in.

30:15.698 --> 30:16.960
Not air conditioned, of course.

30:18.482 --> 30:20.104
And we went all over this state.

30:21.486 --> 30:23.209
Fred was a good teacher.

30:23.628 --> 30:33.001
taught me all the restaurants to eat in, all the motels to stay in, the folks to be friendly with and those to avoid.

30:35.204 --> 30:47.121
Oh, we used to, one of our... Who were, we're not going to ask the negative, the folks to be friendly with, who were some that you remember with pride now and gratitude?

30:51.826 --> 30:57.492
Well, I tend to recall the ones I had the problems with.

30:58.914 --> 31:01.076
Well, you can share those if you want to, but... No.

31:01.857 --> 31:04.379
On the whole, I had no problem with many people.

31:05.220 --> 31:16.292
These were basically all good folks to work with, both in Extension and in the Experiment Station, and the USDA people that we worked with very closely.

31:17.313 --> 31:21.698
At that time, we really didn't make much distinction between state and federal employees.

31:22.572 --> 31:29.730
a situation that ultimately ceased to be, you know, in time.
