WEBVTT

00:06.359 --> 00:19.496
You've received more cooperation in terms of 
large missions, joint cooperations,

00:06.359 --> 00:19.496
oceanographic institutions, international 
cooperation in terms of working the deep seas.

00:23.021 --> 00:27.968
I

00:23.021 --> 00:27.968
suppose so. I think now it's possible for people to 
travel. world's become smaller and we also have a

00:37.105 --> 01:05.037
closer personal relationship with foreign 
scientists so we but we can do this in a more

00:37.105 --> 01:05.037
meaningful and workable way before it was mainly a 
matter of sort of hands across the seamanship of

00:37.105 --> 01:05.037
meeting people from foreign countries and doing 
good things and but now i think it'll become more

00:37.105 --> 01:05.037
more meaningful and getting just the people you 
want i mean it'll be based more upon their

00:37.105 --> 01:05.037
scientific capability in which you're going to 
get out of it rather than just being more or less a

01:05.675 --> 01:13.687
social thing, social phenomenon. So I think 
the...

01:18.374 --> 01:22.420
In other words, we will find talent wherever it is 
regardless of nationality. And people that have

01:23.822 --> 01:34.298
common interests or have compatible interests 
will work together and cooperate in a much more

01:34.683 --> 01:35.985
productive and meaningful way. So I think 
there'll be more cooperation. I would hope that

01:40.371 --> 01:47.441
there's a tendency, of course, to establish very 
large projects. And this is typical in the

01:48.703 --> 02:02.783
meteorology field where you have had a series of 
major expeditions which involve tens of millions

01:48.703 --> 02:02.783
of dollars of input and Bomex and various things 
and these are these are

02:03.387 --> 02:32.770
extremely expensive and I guess it's one way of 
kind of organizing in a way where you can get some

02:03.387 --> 02:32.770
funding on this level because you by having a large 
project you can go to the top so to speak and and get

02:03.387 --> 02:32.770
you get support but

02:03.387 --> 02:32.770
myself I personally not I don't like to be involved 
in these things because you're You spend so much

02:33.796 --> 02:59.933
time in the mechanics of organizing committee 
meetings and organizing things, and I'm afraid

02:33.796 --> 02:59.933
the, for example, the IPOD,

02:33.796 --> 02:59.933
the International Phase of Ocean Drilling, deep 
sea drilling project has been a great success, but

02:33.796 --> 02:59.933
of course very expensive. The Mohul project 
became defunct. And thank God it did. I mean, this

03:05.585 --> 03:07.828
was totally out of hand. The conceptually wrong 
became a political project. There was a contract

03:12.394 --> 03:17.721
given to the wrong company and so forth and so on. So 
when it died, it had a few friends left in the

03:18.822 --> 03:23.128
scientific community. And it was being more or 
less kept afloat only by a few political

03:24.850 --> 03:29.697
interests. But then we this fell apart and we 
regrouped as a deep-sea drilling project, which

03:32.487 --> 03:38.275
was fine. It was really what was suggested in the 
first place by such people as Miliani that we

03:39.477 --> 03:47.349
should take sediment cars. But now this is the iPod 
and as an outsider looking at it, it's become

03:49.572 --> 03:57.904
enormously complex because it's The number of 
committees and subcommittees and world

03:58.897 --> 04:07.765
traveling involved in the organization is 
becoming highly, highly complex. But I suppose

04:08.926 --> 04:17.493
that in

04:08.926 --> 04:17.493
the long run, the results will become more 
meaningful, too. It's very difficult. Well, you

04:19.815 --> 04:27.722
can get money for expeditions and for big 
projects, but it's very difficult to get funding

04:19.815 --> 04:27.722
to work up the results. And this always has been 
this way, I guess it always will be. I hope they

04:33.473 --> 04:44.245
become more sophisticated and can learn that or 
somehow organize things to make sure the results

04:33.473 --> 04:44.245
do in fact get published. It has also been 
suggested now that the emphasis is on the ocean as

04:46.788 --> 04:55.498
being a productive unit, that more and more it'll 
be difficult to work in the deep water. And more and

04:55.917 --> 05:00.683
more oceanographers will concentrate upon 
things like the Gulf Shelf. Would you agree

05:03.106 --> 05:06.910
with that? Well, this is true now. It may be a 
passing phase. I mean, these are things which

05:09.914 --> 05:12.317
hopefully a man can solve. And this will be a great 
difficulty for the next decade. I see that in the

05:19.305 --> 05:24.912
1980s that this matter of legal boundaries and 
working having nations controlling the seas

05:25.820 --> 05:47.000
after 200 miles, this divides the ocean up into a 
great many private domains and this becomes very

05:25.820 --> 05:47.000
ponderable and people go shy away from it. I worked 
off Africa as a chief scientist on one of our ships

05:47.040 --> 05:52.244
and we had to get these permissions. These 
permissions eventually came through, but nearly

05:55.840 --> 05:57.942
always too late. We already had left the area. And 
it raised havoc with all of our programs to try to do

06:01.305 --> 06:07.231
something in terms of reference of these. I mean, 
we had to, for example, we had to program our ship to

06:09.013 --> 06:15.419
be in Dakar. And because there was an election 
going on, and on a certain day, we had to be we were

06:24.106 --> 06:34.195
imposed upon by our own State Department to be out 
of Dakar, I don't know, five days before the

06:24.106 --> 06:34.195
election and not back in until two days after. 
Otherwise, it would appear there was some sort of

06:34.455 --> 06:40.301
show of U.S. force on the elections that we were 
showing the flag. So we had to, anyway, this is

06:41.142 --> 06:47.868
maybe one thing like that you can live with. But 
suppose you have a dozen to live with and you have an

06:48.068 --> 06:51.531
operation on the African coast and you try to 
arrange your plans to fit into all these

06:51.967 --> 07:00.276
requirements, it becomes just totally 
impossible to operate.

07:03.179 --> 07:08.385
Do you feel there's been a proliferation of 
universities offering degrees in oceanography?

07:08.866 --> 07:10.527
Yes, I think probably too many. I

07:11.969 --> 07:17.535
read recently here that there are 10,000 
unemployed divers, and I'm sure this is an

07:19.017 --> 07:23.224
underestimate. And the Florida Institute of 
Technology is hoping to improve this by

07:24.586 --> 07:40.471
developing a course in superdivers, whereby 
diving is just sort of an adjunct to something they

07:24.586 --> 07:40.471
can do as a technician, which is the way it should 
be. But oceanographers are being probably

07:40.911 --> 07:45.058
overproduced. There's been no... Oceanography 
has been entirely a sort of government-supported

07:46.253 --> 08:00.412
activity, unless we enlarge the definition of 
oceanography to include fishing and merchant

07:46.253 --> 08:00.412
marine and such things as that. So it's

08:00.893 --> 08:14.431
become a very large science and probably out of 
proportion to the employment in the field. So it's

08:14.611 --> 08:16.193
very difficult, I think, for... oceanographers 
to my unemployment. And, well, it was very

08:20.191 --> 08:24.116
difficult when I began, too. And this is because 
there were none. There was no precedent. Come in. I

08:28.081 --> 08:43.682
rather

08:28.081 --> 08:43.682
suspect that when... When I first began, I got my 
degree as a Ph.D. in geology, marine geology.

08:54.481 --> 09:08.336
Just before the war, Ken Emery, who was much more 
aggressive or energetic than I am, he wrote 146

08:54.481 --> 09:08.336
letters looking for a position. And he was a Phi 
Beta Kappa, and he had all sorts of top

09:08.356 --> 09:13.602
credentials. He didn't get one favorable reply. I 
sat back while he wrote his letters and encouraged

09:17.592 --> 09:19.875
him. And I thought he'd get two replies, and I'd be 
like Avis. I would try to be second best, you see,

09:25.120 --> 09:30.045
and pick up something he didn't take.

09:33.208 --> 09:35.290
All I corresponded to, he got no replies.

09:38.133 --> 09:42.357
Of course, there was no sort of counseling service 
to act for you. No one knew what an oceanographer

09:42.556 --> 09:44.940
was, a marine geologist was. All companies didn't 
recognize the sub-discipline. Well, it almost

09:49.870 --> 10:00.750
seems, if an outsider looks in upon your 
profession, that immediately after the war, that

09:49.870 --> 10:00.750
ONR and the National Science Foundation sit out to 
encourage the development of oceanography

10:01.507 --> 10:04.790
departments. They'd say, we need to have somebody 
in chemical oceanography, let's say, and there's

10:04.810 --> 10:08.974
not anything really organized. Let's see if we can 
build a department at X university to do such.

10:16.101 --> 10:19.784
Is that the way you perceive the broadening of the 
field of oceanography academically? Yes, it was

10:21.005 --> 10:30.214
well organized from within whereby it was an 
attempt by NSF and ONR and other groups to

10:30.802 --> 11:00.302
Establish the Sea Grant schools, which was, of 
course, Spillhouse was instrumental in, and so

10:30.802 --> 11:00.302
But also there was a great interest on a part of the 
populace and universities to in fact do it because

10:30.802 --> 11:00.302
it is a very exciting field and We did have people 
like Cousteau and do have him around which have

10:30.802 --> 11:00.302
given a very glossy view of oceanography. Most 
oceanographers are critical of Cousteau, and I

11:03.929 --> 11:13.025
suppose I am too, although he's a very good friend 
of mine, and I've sailed in a ship and admire him.

11:13.065 --> 11:16.010
He's been a great spokesman for oceanography, and 
I really admire what he's done. But at the same

11:17.212 --> 11:21.780
time, people do misinterpret what his role is. 
It's like

11:27.417 --> 11:31.323
It's like thinking Ronald Reagan is a president 
rather than a movie actor or something like that.

11:31.343 --> 11:34.348
You have to recognize that. And so,

11:34.368 --> 11:43.882
and there's been a great many people just come to 
you all the time in droves and say, well, my son

11:34.368 --> 11:43.882
likes to die. He wants to become an ocean armor 
permit. And this, of course, is like saying, I know

11:46.526 --> 11:50.873
how to type. I want to become a historian. Yeah, 
right. Would you suggest, if one wanted to become

11:56.392 --> 12:04.902
an oceanographer, that he be trained as an 
undergraduate in a hard science rather than a

11:56.392 --> 12:04.902
general degree in oceanography? In general, yes. 
And I think there's room for both programs. And

12:11.569 --> 12:19.999
Texas A&M and FIT and University of Washington, of 
course, have this undergraduate program. So I

12:20.039 --> 12:24.424
think there's room for all approaches.

12:26.446 --> 12:46.463
I think that

12:26.446 --> 12:46.463
we need more ocean technicians, perhaps, and if 
you take a hard science, I think you're more or less

12:26.446 --> 12:46.463
preparing, and you go towards a PhD program, 
you're more or less preparing yourself for a

12:26.446 --> 12:46.463
career as a research scientist. this this uh this 
field of creating research science is probably is

12:47.860 --> 13:12.045
overpopulated i mean there's too much emphasis 
upon the upon the the phd upon academic science and

12:47.860 --> 13:12.045
not enough upon

12:47.860 --> 13:12.045
other approaches to but i i in spite of the fact 
where i say that we may be over producing

12:47.860 --> 13:12.045
oceanographers Let's face it, we're 
overproducing maybe historians and psychology

13:13.139 --> 13:24.593
majors in even greater numbers, aren't we? So

13:24.773 --> 13:36.207
if we're overproducing in a field, I think it 
should be in a field of

13:24.773 --> 13:36.207
technology, of science. I think these people do 
become... useful citizens and useful and

13:39.818 --> 13:42.881
employable people. Even though they may not end up 
in their chosen field, I think they become highly

13:43.602 --> 13:48.147
employable people. And so these people that are 
trained in oceanography

13:49.048 --> 13:55.295
are not pumping gas. They're employable people 
and they're doing things. I don't know what

13:57.498 --> 13:58.199
they're doing. I don't know where they all go. But 
they do end up having useful careers in general. I

14:07.274 --> 14:11.599
realize that no one has any luck on predicting the 
future. However, let me offer you perhaps a chance

14:12.359 --> 14:16.824
to. It seems as if about the time that you enter the 
field of oceanography, that may I say the hot

14:17.425 --> 14:36.505
fields in oceanography are really marine geology 
and then works with charting and mapping,

14:17.425 --> 14:36.505
particularly moving towards charting and 
mapping in the deep oceans. physical

14:36.974 --> 14:38.035
oceanography. Then, with the explosion of the 
bomb, then the hot field tends to be physics and

14:38.635 --> 14:45.441
physics and oceanography. What would you suggest 
in what direction the future in oceanography will

14:45.461 --> 14:49.485
be?

14:53.888 --> 15:06.559
Well, the explosion of the bomb, there was a great 
proliferation of nuclear physicists, and these

14:53.888 --> 15:06.559
were the There's remarkable prestige associated 
with being a nuclear physicist to the point that

15:08.328 --> 15:20.084
they even got... Any nuclear physicist was a great 
man regardless of what he did. And even if he was a

15:20.705 --> 15:27.554
poor one, he could be the head of an oceanographic 
laboratory

15:20.705 --> 15:27.554
by his prestige. But...

15:33.722 --> 15:35.685
In oceanography, the future...

15:39.918 --> 15:45.571
Well, the greatest success in oceanography, I 
think, has been the concept of plate tectonics. If

15:45.631 --> 15:57.319
you look at a new textbook in geology, I taught 
geology at Washington

15:45.631 --> 15:57.319
last semester, There only are two new chapters in 
classical geology. One concerns planetology,

16:00.418 --> 16:03.822
the planets. The other really concerns plate 
tectonics, the new model of the world. These are

16:07.046 --> 16:08.548
the two new things. And of course, plate tectonics 
is mainly based upon the data of marine geology and

16:08.628 --> 16:14.375
geophysics. It's a triumph, really, for 
understanding the ocean floor. And the whole

16:20.202 --> 16:26.209
field of plate tectonics is likely to be a very 
bright field. for many years. I mean, for several

16:28.631 --> 16:43.466
decades we will be making very useful results in 
understanding earthquake prediction and

16:28.631 --> 16:43.466
mechanics of the Earth's surface and 
interpreting these in terms of mineral deposits.

16:44.728 --> 16:54.778
So, I think there's a, while the frontier may not be 
quite endless, there is still a great frontier and

16:55.703 --> 17:25.002
in the oceans and it is deep oceans are 60% of the 
earth and so there's an enormous amount of work to

16:55.703 --> 17:25.002
be done in marine geology and I think there will be 
very exciting discoveries and it's a very

16:55.703 --> 17:25.002
very promising field

16:55.703 --> 17:25.002
I think that the Earlier, we were talking about 
large projects, one of these large projects,

17:25.927 --> 17:36.701
which is, you know, like the International 
Oceanographic Expedition was based upon,

17:25.927 --> 17:36.701
really, it's a geographic thing. There are other 
large projects which are ongoing and which are

17:38.283 --> 17:42.949
based on problem solving. Now, the CLIMAP 
program, understanding more about past climates

17:44.131 --> 17:52.221
in terms of bringing together people who can do 
this thing all over the world, both on land and in

17:52.690 --> 17:59.360
the sea, looking at deep sea sediments. This is a 
very fine project. And I'm sure that there'll be

18:02.124 --> 18:09.976
some great results coming from Climap. And a good 
part of this input will be marine geologic. But

18:14.963 --> 18:21.853
we'll learn more to understand more about how the 
Earth really works, not only the the crust but also

18:22.627 --> 18:24.730
the ocean itself. I don't think even today we know 
what would happen if we dammed the Straits of

18:25.410 --> 18:31.558
Gibraltar.

18:34.842 --> 18:47.357
We know that there's a water mass coming out of 
there which is warm and saline and becomes

18:34.842 --> 18:47.357
mid-water, North Atlantic mid-water and can be 
observed up off Ireland.

18:50.581 --> 18:52.363
And this is a very important oceanic phenomenon. 
But how it affects climates, nobody knows. You

18:58.275 --> 19:09.267
could build a scenario saying it would cause the 
earth to get colder by blocking the straits, or you

18:58.275 --> 19:09.267
can make a scenario equally rational saying the 
world might get warmer, you see. So we don't really

19:10.308 --> 19:20.460
know the effects of oceanography

19:21.638 --> 19:26.786
on the scale where we can really understand the 
ocean of the world. This is something which will be

19:26.846 --> 19:28.288
forthcoming. What happens when we block the 
Bering Sea or something like the Bering Straits?

19:34.658 --> 19:41.588
What would happen if we have a sea level canal going 
through Panama?

19:47.204 --> 19:54.495
Now the other thing which is developed in 
oceanography, which is very important, is

19:47.204 --> 19:54.495
satellite oceanography. Because we'll have a sea 
satellite,

19:54.515 --> 20:02.486
SeaSat-1, I guess be launched in a couple of years 
from now. And we'll be able to, for the first time,

20:03.948 --> 20:08.355
to get a synoptic view of the ocean, know what's 
going on. I guess every 18 days we'd occupy the same

20:08.395 --> 20:13.482
station. And so the state of the sea can be 
assessed, the roughness and warmth and so forth.

20:20.845 --> 20:27.814
And so this whole idea of remote sensing of the 
ocean is a new and bright field. And I guess to

20:29.496 --> 20:40.090
process the data involved in Seasat will take an 
enormous group of people to process that data. And

20:40.550 --> 20:44.295
of course, when you do have a synoptic view of the 
ocean it'll in turn give us some sort of a long-term

20:44.782 --> 21:09.844
view of climate and it'll be enormously 
profitable too because if we can predict climate

20:44.782 --> 21:09.844
or predict these things seem to be rather small 
problems but they have enormous consequence i

20:44.782 --> 21:09.844
mean in terms of their economic spinoff involved 
in understanding the climate just a little bit

21:10.381 --> 21:27.368
more

21:10.381 --> 21:27.368
will make oceanography probably an economic 
thing to really understand more about the world.

21:28.390 --> 21:31.475
So things like this, I think, have a very bright 
future. Remote sensing, plate tectonics of the

21:31.495 --> 21:38.025
ocean floor,

21:39.372 --> 21:48.687
learning more about the total, the picture of the 
ocean, the climate project and things of that are

21:39.372 --> 21:48.687
very useful and very important programs. Now

21:48.727 --> 21:59.946
in terms of oceanographic training or training 
for oceanographers then, Would you suggest that

22:00.803 --> 22:04.648
oceanographers will spend more time at sea or less 
time at sea? Will they spend more time trying to

22:04.668 --> 22:13.580
sort through the data they already have in terms of 
now the new impact of the computer, or will there be

22:04.668 --> 22:13.580
more sea voyages?

22:20.108 --> 22:21.310
Well, I...

22:27.837 --> 22:29.660
I guess it would be more steady state. You wouldn't 
really, you can see more reason to, certainly with

22:29.780 --> 22:38.454
satellites, you can, this will be at the need for 
some surface observations. And with remote

22:40.677 --> 22:54.199
sensing from aircraft and use of submarines and 
DRVs, deep submersibles,

22:40.677 --> 22:54.199
these,

22:55.732 --> 22:57.394
Oceanography may be done in a different way. Now, 
of course, the primary vehicle of oceanography is

22:57.494 --> 23:19.503
the surface ship, and it probably will remain so, 
but it'll be supplemented to a much more important

22:57.494 --> 23:19.503
degree by satellite oceanography and other 
techniques of data gathering. The science is only

23:19.523 --> 23:22.988
as good as instrumentation But once you develop a 
new instrument, it really opens up

23:23.828 --> 23:31.997
enormous possibilities. For example, the advent 
of echo sounding.

23:38.164 --> 23:42.929
And we get to the point where we really think we can 
see the ocean floor. We see mountains in our minds

23:43.609 --> 23:45.371
and so forth. Of course, we've never seen it. 
That's all. But in our minds, we think we see the

23:48.615 --> 23:52.519
ocean floor. But

23:53.242 --> 24:07.924
the other thing which has been an enormous 
development has been the reflection profile

23:53.242 --> 24:07.924
whereby we get sort of an x-ray radiographic 
vision of the sediments, their thickness on the

23:53.242 --> 24:07.924
ocean floor. And once we improve this technique, 
its resolution, Or once we get more powerful tools

24:18.200 --> 24:28.331
whereby we can, say, bounce echoes off the moho, 
this justifies a whole new survey of the ocean for

24:18.200 --> 24:28.331
this purpose alone. And so the more we know about 
problems, the more problems that we really

24:29.853 --> 24:43.168
generate. And I guess in a very social way, also, we 
People have to keep busy. They have to keep

24:47.709 --> 24:48.971
employed, you know. They have to have. And so

24:50.814 --> 24:58.083
we're not going to get to the point where we just sit 
around and sit on our data doing anything. We're

24:58.244 --> 25:01.648
always going to be looking for new problems to 
solve. And some of these problems, even if they're

25:02.249 --> 25:08.137
non-problems, we're going to try to solve them. I 
wondered perhaps if maybe this romantic

25:08.157 --> 25:15.747
attraction to the sea that took people like you and 
Emory and Shepard to the sea, if this may... maybe

25:16.182 --> 25:25.096
through for oceanographers, maybe if they should 
work more with satellites or what have you, maybe

25:16.182 --> 25:25.096
the day-by-day getting your foot wet, as Ravel 
said, may be gone. Well,

25:25.957 --> 25:30.083
perhaps so. I think there's something to this, but 
it may also be aging on the part of Ravel and myself

25:30.103 --> 25:38.155
and other people. I think young people are bound to 
be romantic, and they're bound to have this.

25:43.784 --> 25:45.126
Certainly people that... in the scuba diving 
community, for example. They're highly caught up

25:48.511 --> 25:50.614
with the romance of the sea. And we don't see any let 
up in

25:52.176 --> 26:00.046
people being interested in sailing and boating. 
Of course, when we first worked off California, we

26:00.086 --> 26:08.457
worked in sort of frontiers. We were going out and 
just going along the long California coast or out

26:08.477 --> 26:13.003
to the islands. These were sort of unknown 
territories then, which few people had visited.

26:17.936 --> 26:20.779
And now, of course, they're highly populated. The 
whole thing has changed. So I think

26:21.840 --> 26:32.130
that people like Ravel and some of the early 
people, they did things of the missionary zeal.

26:32.230 --> 26:39.296
They weren't in it as more or less as a way of making a 
living. They were in it just for the romance of the

26:39.316 --> 26:43.260
sea. The sea was very mysterious then. It's less so 
now because we know more about it. And I guess as we

26:50.884 --> 27:00.896
begin to understand the world better,

26:50.884 --> 27:00.896
people still look for mysticism. I mean, more than 
half the world believes in UFOs. Some 80% of the

27:07.865 --> 27:10.669
people believe in horoscopes or something like 
that. They believe in the effect of of stars have

27:13.666 --> 27:27.186
upon their birth, although one would think that 
the moment they were conceived would be more

27:13.666 --> 27:27.186
important than when they're actually born, more 
or less like their Chinese birthday. You see, when

27:27.206 --> 27:32.273
you're in China, when you're born, you're a year 
old on whatever their New Year's is. And if you're

27:32.754 --> 27:37.742
born the day after their New Year's, which is 
something like February 20th, you're two years

27:32.754 --> 27:37.742
old. You're another year old. So you can be two days 
old, and you can be two years old.

27:45.458 --> 27:50.946
And the gravitational effect of Jupiter on me is no 
greater than the effect of you sitting there on me.

27:50.966 --> 27:52.488
And the gravitational effect of you is larger.

27:55.933 --> 28:00.400
But people persist in looking for mysticism in the 
world, and always will. And there's a need for it, I

28:01.662 --> 28:04.166
suppose. And the more we open up a rational world, 
the more people will seek out mysticism. And so you

28:12.982 --> 28:17.107
think the romance of the sea will continue to 
attract young people into oceanography? I think

28:17.828 --> 28:18.569
it will, yes. The romance of the sea will continue 
to. And

28:21.252 --> 28:28.341
it remains fascinating, it really does, 
particularly all aspects of the sea. The life in

28:28.461 --> 28:36.251
the sea is much more diverse than life on land, the 
invertebrates and the types of animals there. So,

28:36.311 --> 28:41.217
and to me, it still is a very remarkable 
environment. And so I think the romance of the sea

28:44.115 --> 28:51.358
will certainly remain.
