00:01.280 --> 00:11.609
July 30th, 1981, in Jacksonville, Texas, 
interviewing Major General Buckner as Terry

00:01.280 --> 00:11.609
Anderson.

00:15.413 --> 00:22.299
And remember, we can take off and edit this tape, so 
just let's be as informal as possible. This is an

00:22.319 --> 00:24.962
interview with Major General Buckner. Today is 
the 30th of July, 1981. This is Terry Anderson. We

00:28.887 --> 00:31.751
want to start out by learning something about your 
background, sir. Could you tell us where and when

00:32.312 --> 00:34.395
you were born? I was born on January 11, 1919, in 
Cleburne, Texas. Could you tell us about your

00:41.746 --> 00:43.328
parents? My father was a city engineer, and my 
mother was the daughter of a

00:43.949 --> 00:53.443
house building contractor. Did your father have a 
formal education for engineering, or did he just

00:54.908 --> 01:00.416
pick it up as a trade? No, he was a graduate of the 
Texas A&M class in 1912. Really? There's a watch

01:07.607 --> 01:08.568
fob. Oh, yes, it is. A&M College of Texas, 1912. 
That's great. And he was very proud of the fact that

01:17.462 --> 01:23.110
he went all the way through at Texas A&M and he 
remained a private for four years. He did. But he

01:25.984 --> 01:27.987
worked his way through. He scoped the furnishings 
at night and worked his way through the whole

01:28.548 --> 01:33.435
thing. That's fantastic. And then did he set up 
this company? No, he had his own company and

01:37.040 --> 01:47.055
after he was city engineer in about 1921, He 
decided to get into business for himself, and he

01:48.638 --> 01:55.486
started bidding highway jobs. The first one he had 
was in Henderson, Texas. And then from there, he

01:59.912 --> 02:11.045
went down there in the Austin, San Antonio area and 
worked on the highways down there. We ended up in

02:12.908 --> 02:16.452
Austin. Austin's where I started the school. And 
from there we moved to Navasota. It was very

02:25.411 --> 02:31.720
interesting because I started out in an 
experimental school there in Austin. My sister

02:31.740 --> 02:33.162
was there as well. She was a year ahead of me. And at 
the end of the, I guess I was in the second grade, I

02:45.608 --> 02:51.557
started the school at midterm when I was six years 
old, before I was six years old. And it was very

02:53.400 --> 02:58.849
interesting because when I got to Navasota they 
put me back half a grade because I hadn't had enough

02:53.400 --> 02:58.849
math. They put my sister forward a crate because 
this experimental school was so much more

02:59.390 --> 03:07.262
advanced. I noticed last night when I was jogging 
through the area that there was a Buckner part of

03:07.698 --> 03:19.913
your family. That's my uncle, yes. Well, that part 
of it came later. While we were at Navasota, my

03:25.741 --> 03:33.250
father was injured in an accident and crushed his 
leg. hip and he was in an automobile accident and he

03:34.040 --> 03:49.278
had to go to the hospital in Houston and he asked his 
younger brother, Robert, to come over there and

03:34.040 --> 03:49.278
watch Eric do the job for him.

03:52.622 --> 03:58.950
He came over there to help and Eric, while he went 
back, Got in the cotton gin business and worked

03:59.352 --> 04:07.282
sawmill and a few other things. And later on, my 
dad, after we moved from Navasota, we moved to

04:07.302 --> 04:13.069
Cleaver and he never moved from there again. 
That's where we stayed until he died. But R.C.

04:18.817 --> 04:24.564
Robert, he invited him to come in partnership with 
him and he did. And in about 1929 or 30,

04:31.010 --> 04:34.154
And my dad liked to do work all over the state of 
Texas. And he actually completed jobs in 250 of the

04:34.174 --> 04:40.782
254 counties in the state of Texas. And his brother 
lived here in, not here in Jacksonville, he

04:40.802 --> 04:52.296
actually lived in Sackle, which is down the road 
from here, not very far. And they continued as

04:53.978 --> 05:00.966
Buckner Brothers for three or four years.

05:02.785 --> 05:04.428
Robert R.C. decided that he wanted to get married, 
and he didn't want to do all that traveling. So they

05:09.997 --> 05:14.304
split up, and the company here was R.C. Buckner 
until 1956, and then it became Buckner

05:14.364 --> 05:19.933
Construction Company. And my father was John F. 
Buckner and later John F. Buckner's son. He took

05:25.924 --> 05:28.728
all his sons in. The business there, the war was 
over except for me. Well, he offered me the

05:30.992 --> 05:35.559
opportunity. I stayed in the Air Force. And my 
youngest brother is still running that company,

05:36.120 --> 05:45.094
although the name of it now is Dan Buckner 
Incorporated in Cleveland. In the meantime, R.C.

05:46.808 --> 05:50.054
Buckner became Buckner Construction Company. He 
became Buckner and Moore, and they split up. He was

05:53.962 --> 05:56.126
a cousin of mine, by the way. Right next door, M.G. 
Moore. His son, incidentally, went to M.G. Moore.

06:05.204 --> 06:05.344
And... Robert R.C. decided he wanted to get out of 
the business, and he knew that I was getting ready

06:08.858 --> 06:19.711
to retire from the service, and he offered me the 
opportunity to buy into the business. And that's

06:19.731 --> 06:22.575
what I did in 1971. Okay, let's go back and let's 
talk about your mother. Tell me about her. We

06:31.126 --> 06:32.107
haven't mentioned her. Well, actually, she was 
born in Russ, Texas. As I said, my grandfather was a

06:37.522 --> 06:41.587
house builder. He built houses. Then they went 
back to Cleveland. And then she went to high school

06:47.455 --> 06:57.688
there, and she went to the University of Texas, and 
she taught school

06:47.455 --> 06:57.688
for a year or two. I guess that's where they met, in 
Cleveland. She never did go to college. Oh, she

07:03.215 --> 07:04.457
went to the University of Texas. Oh, I thought you 
said she went to high school, then she started

07:04.555 --> 07:07.799
teaching school. No, she went to the University of 
Texas. Okay, so both your parents then had

07:09.522 --> 07:12.045
degrees. No, she didn't get a degree. She got her 
teacher's certificate a couple of years. Sure.

07:18.834 --> 07:24.102
She taught school, and then after she got married, 
she raised five children. What type of person was

07:25.143 --> 07:26.945
she? Can you sort of describe her character? Yes, 
she was very religious and very... What religion?

07:35.123 --> 07:35.904
Baptist. Okay. And my father was a very staunch 
Baptist,

07:37.186 --> 07:42.172
too. He was chairman of the Lord of Deacons for a 
number of years, in charge of the building

07:42.192 --> 07:48.861
committee.

07:48.881 --> 07:51.604
A staunch supporter. Also a staunch supporter of 
Boy Scouts. He was on the circle team of council.

07:57.932 --> 08:02.338
And my mother was very active in... the women's 
club activities that they had in the town. She

08:08.114 --> 08:14.101
liked to garden and grow flowers. She was a very 
sweet and understanding person. There were a lot

08:17.626 --> 08:22.271
of people that took advantage of her for that 
reason. She enjoyed other people. Sounds like

08:25.943 --> 08:29.649
they were both involved in community activities. 
Much so. Except my father was on the road pretty

08:31.252 --> 08:34.898
deep. He had jobs everywhere. He traveled a lot. 
He'd get up at 4 o'clock in the morning. We wouldn't

08:42.811 --> 08:47.398
see him until evening or maybe only on Sunday. He 
was always there on Sunday. I missed out.

08:54.175 --> 08:59.968
Can you tell me, can you sort of describe your type 
of person, the character of your father?

09:04.338 --> 09:11.273
Well, I'd have to say that he was, if you ever called 
anybody straight arrow, that's what he was. His

09:11.692 --> 09:26.605
word was

09:11.692 --> 09:26.605
bond, and he wouldn't intentionally

09:11.692 --> 09:26.605
beat anybody out of anyone.

09:26.625 --> 09:39.656
He was very, very meticulous

09:26.625 --> 09:39.656
about

09:26.625 --> 09:39.656
it, about human relationships. He had a great 
strength of character. He was a strong-willed

09:41.678 --> 09:43.462
man. Yes, very strong-willed man. He didn't 
drink, he didn't smoke, he didn't swear. He was a

09:51.379 --> 09:53.784
straight arrow. Was he tough?

09:58.283 --> 10:01.387
Or was he understanding? I imagine some people 
would call him tough, but he did have a very good

10:01.407 --> 10:13.485
sense of understanding, a feeling of 
understanding. It sounds like religion was

10:13.505 --> 10:16.609
important in your upbringing. Is that true? 
That's true. Sunday school and church every

10:20.474 --> 10:26.744
Sunday.

10:26.764 --> 10:28.707
Usually twice on Sunday. Church twice on Sunday. 
In the morning and in the evening too. And

10:34.215 --> 10:38.001
sometimes on Wednesday evening. Who is the 
authority in the household? My father. All of

10:42.969 --> 10:43.950
them. My mother was left with a lot of things to do 
because he was gone for sure. And you had five,

10:53.119 --> 10:57.946
there were five children in the family, so you had 
four siblings. Yeah. How'd you get along with

10:58.707 --> 10:59.608
them? Tell me, what happened to them? I mean, did 
they also become leaders like you did? Well, my

11:06.637 --> 11:09.260
sister married a dentist. She lives in Cleveland. 
She was the oldest. My next older brother was in the

11:13.907 --> 11:18.814
Marines during the war. He was a tank battalion 
commander.

11:24.803 --> 11:29.410
And the next brother was in the Marines. He was a 
pilot for the B-25s. And the youngest one was in the

11:32.535 --> 11:37.242
Navy. He just got in as the war ended,

11:39.213 --> 11:51.454
I think. He was just a sailor on a ship. My sister 
graduated from Baylor. And my next oldest brother

11:55.278 --> 12:12.168
graduated from the University of Texas, and the 
other two

11:55.278 --> 12:12.168
graduated from

11:55.278 --> 12:12.168
Texas A&M after the war. So it started before, but 
then ended up after finishing up. If religion was a

12:13.390 --> 12:19.581
strong influence, why didn't all the children go 
to bail? My dad had one prerequisite. He sent us to

12:23.941 --> 12:25.846
school. Everybody had to have at

12:25.866 --> 12:36.996
least two years of military

12:25.866 --> 12:36.996
time. I don't know that any of the children were

12:36.976 --> 12:52.317
quite as

12:36.976 --> 12:52.317
religious as your parents. We do go to church. What 
happened to your brothers? Are they still in the

12:57.385 --> 13:00.349
engineering business? No, the youngest one is the 
only one still alive. The other two both contacted

13:03.333 --> 13:05.616
me. some kind of fungus or something to deal with

13:07.385 --> 13:23.103
asthma out in Southwest Pacific during World War 
II, and they had trouble breathing.

13:23.123 --> 13:34.236
And the next to the youngest, Arthur, had a worse 
case, and he was allergic to his own infection, and

13:23.123 --> 13:34.236
he moved to Well, he came back after the war and he 
started working and he had a job out in the Alpine,

13:34.503 --> 13:49.862
which is a higher level and he seemed to do better, 
but it didn't get better, enough better, so he

13:34.503 --> 13:49.862
moved to Arizona. Went to work. He got a graduate 
degree from the University of Arizona. He worked

13:59.475 --> 14:06.045
for the state for a while, and then he got out on his 
own selling water systems. He was selling and

14:06.065 --> 14:10.231
installing water systems. He's also an engineer? 
Yes, he was a civil engineer graduate. But he

14:17.461 --> 14:19.123
died...

14:21.128 --> 14:25.272
The year before last. And my next oldest brother, 
Erwin. He died

14:28.182 --> 14:44.884
when he was 45

14:28.182 --> 14:44.884
years old in 1960.

14:44.904 --> 14:45.986
He had a cardiac arrest. He was a business 
administration lady. He was in the business with

14:50.592 --> 14:52.975
my father. Three brothers were there for a while, 
and finally the one brother

14:52.955 --> 15:05.402
had left in Arizona, and the other two were in, and 
were my father. Now, for... people in your period,

15:08.783 --> 15:12.088
your generation. It was not that typical for young 
people to go to college, but not only did your

15:12.108 --> 15:22.404
parents both attend college, but all the kids went 
to college. Wow. Why was that? We were all

15:25.928 --> 15:30.258
motivated and oriented in that direction. Your 
parents continually told you that someday you're

15:30.278 --> 15:35.390
going to college? There was never any other future 
in mind except going to college. My father that put

15:44.491 --> 15:51.648
himself through college, and he was that way from 
the time he was born. He knew he wanted to go to

15:51.668 --> 15:55.035
college, and he did it. And that's the same, I guess 
he, motivated us in the same direction.

16:05.704 --> 16:16.962
Now you've had a very successful career, rising to 
gentleship, and I was wondering in what ways do you

16:05.704 --> 16:16.962
think that your parents are responsible for that? 
Well, I guess my father was the most responsible

16:18.781 --> 16:34.199
because he insisted on the military training. I 
went to John Tarleton. I got indoctrinated into

16:36.922 --> 16:46.493
the military there, so I decided that I wanted to 
make a career. It was a very forceful Major

16:47.975 --> 17:01.932
Bender, who was a colonel during World War II that 
killed a beach in Normandy. He was a character.

17:07.010 --> 17:15.244
was a great influence

17:07.010 --> 17:15.244
on my children. I liked the life that he led, and I 
liked him. I liked his family, and I enjoyed the

17:22.536 --> 17:29.387
military. He inspired them. Yes, he did. As a 
matter of fact, he talked me into taking CMTC in

17:30.629 --> 17:31.971
1938. And I was there on the book of formation as 
soon as I was 21. And there he introduced me to

17:44.204 --> 17:46.068
recent graduates from West Point. And they taught 
me how to go into West Point. Ostensibly,

17:48.337 --> 18:06.946
Lieutenant Meyer, who was an

17:48.337 --> 18:06.946
Army football player, found out that I was an 
all-Congress football player in Virginia

17:48.337 --> 18:06.946
College. He was going to get me an appointment in 
West Point, Pennsylvania. At the meantime, he

18:08.308 --> 18:09.670
told me to go for my own challenge, which I did. I 
took the entrance exam. I made the highest grade of

18:15.961 --> 18:22.011
the people who were taking it. He had two 
appointments, I believe, one to the Naval Academy

18:22.031 --> 18:25.957
and one to the Military Academy. So I chose to go to 
the Military Academy. That's where I really

18:26.978 --> 18:29.082
wanted to go. Why did you decide on the Army and then 
the Air Force instead of the Navy? Well, I was going

18:35.738 --> 18:42.777
to the Army because I wanted to be in the infantry. 
At that time, I didn't know anything about the Air

18:42.797 --> 18:46.909
Force. The connection I had with the Air Force, I 
had marched with the Army. Well,

18:50.960 --> 19:09.227
we had a

18:50.960 --> 19:09.227
crack platoon that marched in the Battle of 
Flowers Parade in San Antonio. We got to go out to, I

19:09.247 --> 19:12.872
believe it was either Brooks or Kelly Field, and we 
got to crawl over some airplanes, and that was my

19:09.247 --> 19:12.872
first association with airplanes. I saw that they 
did a fly-by there, too. Were you pretty

19:13.673 --> 19:18.720
impressed? I was very impressed, but I didn't know 
whether I had the proclivity that it took me an

19:19.141 --> 19:22.466
80-year-old. I mean, I really, as I look back now, I 
wasn't that enthusiastic about it. I thought it

19:28.755 --> 19:31.699
was great, but I was in the emphasis. Let's go back 
to your education, though. You were telling me

19:35.821 --> 19:37.223
about Austin. What about your junior high and your 
high school? Well, we moved to, we moved to Cuba

19:39.787 --> 19:50.002
from, uh, Minnesota to Cleveland.

19:50.022 --> 19:57.113
And, uh, we were there, you know, I think I was

19:50.022 --> 19:57.113
in the I

19:57.093 --> 20:22.772
suppose I was in the second grade. And I went to the 
third and the fourth and the fifth grade to a

20:22.792 --> 20:24.876
elementary school. And then we moved to another 
area of the city.

20:29.425 --> 20:56.459
And

20:29.425 --> 20:56.459
I

20:29.425 --> 20:56.459
went to what was called the junior high, because it 
had the elementary grades plus the junior high all

20:29.425 --> 20:56.459
at once, just across the street. I got a couple 
blocks from the high school. I finished junior

20:57.380 --> 20:58.481
high and went right into high school. What were 
your favorite subjects? I suppose, man.

21:03.811 --> 21:15.087
Did you excel at that?

21:15.107 --> 21:19.814
Yes,

21:15.107 --> 21:19.814
I made new friends. After I found out that you had to 
behave, after being switched a few times to sit on

21:19.834 --> 21:25.302
the steps during recess and those types of 
disciplines, I learned that My dad promised me a

21:26.547 --> 21:33.483
bicycle if I'd get on the honor roll three months in 
a row. And the main thing I had to overcome was to be

21:33.503 --> 21:39.075
into Portland,

21:33.503 --> 21:39.075
which I did. And I got a bicycle. You said that you 
were a footballer? Yes, I started football when

21:44.530 --> 21:53.931
I was in Jan Long's elementary school in fifth 
grade. I played in the sixth grade and I was on the

21:53.951 --> 21:57.017
junior high team. I played four years in high 
school. What position? Guard. Guard?

22:03.571 --> 22:04.934
Must have been a tiger, you know. You don't look 
like you're big enough for a guard. Well, in those

22:08.902 --> 22:11.909
days, they had smaller people. I weighed more than 
a pound. In high school, I weighed 170 pounds. I was

22:16.959 --> 22:22.912
heavier than 175 pounds.

22:22.932 --> 22:23.172
My goodness. That's why I played guitar all the 
time. Were you in other activities in school? Yes.

22:33.300 --> 22:37.605
Oh, I was

22:33.300 --> 22:37.605
in a music memory contest. I was

22:37.625 --> 22:44.033
in a play. We didn't have too many activities. We 
were so poor, we didn't even have an annual. Right.

22:48.779 --> 22:54.486
Would you consider yourself a leader in high 
school, and I was interested when? When generals

22:54.905 --> 23:00.490
start assuming leadership roles, when do you 
think you did? Was it in high school? Yes, it was in

23:01.611 --> 23:03.473
high school. I was captain

23:03.493 --> 23:17.966
of the football team and captain of the basketball 
team. Did you like that role? Yes. Then I was

23:18.567 --> 23:19.367
co-captain in junior college. Would you consider 
yourself popular in high school? Well, I don't

23:22.917 --> 23:35.297
think,

23:22.917 --> 23:35.297
I don't remember anything. I was too shy, and I 
didn't date much. I was popular with the boys, but

23:36.358 --> 23:40.605
that way with the girls I wasn't particularly 
popular. Did you have a lot of friends? Yes, I did.

23:45.681 --> 23:54.848
Why do you think that they picked you for the 
captain of these

23:45.681 --> 23:54.848
two teams? Well, it's

23:57.460 --> 24:13.369
hard to say. But it wasn't because I was very 
articulate, because I wasn't. I never was an

24:16.414 --> 24:17.376
articulate person of equations. I guess

24:17.356 --> 24:37.647
they looked to me because I was able to make good 
grades and I knew all the plays and I helped

24:17.356 --> 24:37.647
them in the game. Now this, of course, is right 
during the Great Depression. I was wondering at

24:41.934 --> 24:44.157
the Depression, a pathetic economic situation on 
the country in the mid-1930s had any impact on your

24:45.098 --> 24:54.028
upbringing and your family? Well, nobody had any 
money.

24:59.341 --> 25:07.869
Everybody

24:59.341 --> 25:07.869
was in the same boat, but no one had fun. Every once 
in a while, I guess, I'd get a nickel to get an ice

25:07.889 --> 25:24.524
cream cone. I was a small kid. When I was a small kid, 
I came out here to East Texas and worked on my

25:24.924 --> 25:27.586
grandfather's farm. And I got interested in 
farming, and I decided I wanted a cow. I started

25:31.858 --> 25:39.928
milking cows and my father bought a cow when I was 
about to third or fourth grade. Later on he added

25:43.177 --> 25:50.849
another one, so I met with gals twice a day until I 
got out of high school. My brother has cursed me

25:50.869 --> 25:51.590
ever since. He goes, I went to my next older brother 
after I left, and after he left I went to the next

25:51.610 --> 26:00.904
one, and after he left I came to the last one, and the 
last one sort of cried him up. And he was happy it did

26:00.884 --> 26:05.953
dry

26:00.884 --> 26:05.953
up. Did the depression have any effect on your 
father's business? Oh yeah. I think he went broke.

26:16.532 --> 26:18.436
At least he ran out of money. He had to move in with my 
grandmother in Cleveland. But he started all over

26:22.663 --> 26:24.647
again. He kept on going. So if he was broke, in other 
words, he was unemployed for a while? No, he wasn't

26:33.226 --> 26:36.212
employed. He just didn't have a job. Oh, you mean he 
didn't, no one, in other words, no one hired his

26:39.190 --> 26:43.939
construction services? Well, it wasn't a 
question of that. When you run out of money and you

26:46.725 --> 26:55.041
have to sell all of your equipment, well, he had to 
sell all of his equipment after the job was over. He

26:55.061 --> 26:56.704
got injured. He got all this trouble. I don't know 
how mad all people was financially, but I know that

26:58.748 --> 27:05.262
we didn't have any money. Did you have enough food 
on the table? Oh yes, we raised a lot of food. And of

27:11.616 --> 27:14.462
course I was milking the cow. things got better. He 
started making money, I suppose. The

27:24.876 --> 27:33.165
construction business would have a bad job, 
especially back then when you only had one job at a

27:24.876 --> 27:33.165
time. You had to move your mules and everything 
with you, but he had to sell all his mules and all his

27:33.185 --> 27:38.931
equipment. And it may have been a good thing 
because they started mechanizing everything

27:38.951 --> 27:42.475
after that, but we never had mules again.

27:45.391 --> 27:52.173
When you graduated from high school, had you 
already made up your mind what you wanted to be? Did

27:52.514 --> 27:55.203
you have firm ideas? I thought I wanted to be a 
mechanical engineer. When I left high school,

27:59.414 --> 28:10.164
that's what I took at Tarleton and A&M. At A&M, I 
decided I wanted to get a

28:10.184 --> 28:25.057
degree in mechanical and civil engineering, and 
then go to MIT and get a master's in mechanical

28:10.184 --> 28:25.057
engineering. That was my goal. I thought it would 
change my mind at Tarleton, and I wanted to go

28:25.437 --> 28:28.140
there. Why? Why MIT? Well, that was just the 
reputation they had. In my mind, it was in my mind as

28:39.042 --> 28:50.275
a good place to go to get a master's degree. It's my 
dad's name, and it must be someone to be a part of his

28:50.295 --> 28:54.880
thing. But that was my, that was what I had outlined 
when I said I would go. During the Depression, did

28:58.865 --> 29:02.308
Your father support the New Deal and Franklin 
Roosevelt? Do you remember? I haven't the

29:05.191 --> 29:07.714
slightest idea. Was he in any way political? Not 
that I know of. Did he vote? Oh, yes, he voted. Who

29:14.981 --> 29:19.605
did he usually vote, Democrat or Republican, or 
conservative or liberal? I don't know.

29:20.626 --> 29:20.826
Democrats. I know, but I mean, did he vote for 
liberal Democrats or ones that supported? I don't

29:25.611 --> 29:26.492
think we had any. in Texas,

29:26.472 --> 29:44.627
they may have

29:26.472 --> 29:44.627
been. But the ones that we had on a national level, I 
know, the guy that appointed me to the military, he

29:44.647 --> 29:47.232
was an old-time conservative. Are

29:47.212 --> 29:57.220
there local legislators, state legislators? I 
don't know too much about politics. When did you

29:58.003 --> 30:02.335
start paying attention to politics? After I got

30:02.821 --> 30:29.550
the right

30:02.821 --> 30:29.550
to vote, let's

30:02.821 --> 30:29.550
see, up until 19,

30:02.821 --> 30:29.550
I don't know what year, I don't remember what year 
it was, criminals and regular army people could

30:02.821 --> 30:29.550
not vote for the state of Texas. I was a regular army 
. And when

30:29.990 --> 30:51.236
you finally did get the franchise, who did, what 
party, or what, did you vote, liberal, moderate,

30:29.990 --> 30:51.236
or conservative, independent? Conservative.

30:55.442 --> 30:57.364
Mostly Republican. And are you a member of a 
political party now, or are you just? I call myself

31:03.722 --> 31:05.384
independent. I support a lot of Republicans, but I 
support a lot of Democrats, too. We have a state

31:12.995 --> 31:19.503
senator here, Peyton McKnight, I strongly 
support. He's a Democrat. I support Governor

31:19.964 --> 31:27.334
Reagan, President Reagan, and I support him. I'm 
supporting all these programs too. Now, why'd you

31:33.795 --> 31:37.460
decide on Tarleton? Why'd you immediately go up to 
Tarleton instead of going to A&M? Well,

31:41.284 --> 31:48.073
I was thinking about the two years of military. And 
also, I thought I had a better chance to play

31:49.420 --> 31:58.857
football there than I did at that

31:49.420 --> 31:58.857
time. And you made the $10,000.

32:10.922 --> 32:12.724
Yes. I was not given a scholarship then. I was just a 
walk-on. But I went over early and started to

32:18.811 --> 32:22.035
practice. Finally got some of the big boys hurt. It 
allowed me to have a chance to show what I could do.

32:24.357 --> 32:25.619
The coach of the team was Chuck Saunders, the guard 
from S.E.U. He helped me a lot. He was really good.

32:26.540 --> 32:26.920
He taught me a lot. And then you stayed there for one 
year, is that not correct? Two years. Did you go to

32:31.927 --> 32:35.433
A&M for one year, or did you go directly from? I went 
two years to Tarleton,

32:35.453 --> 32:43.985
then I went to A&M, and while I was at A&M, I took the 
entrance. So you went to A&M for one year, which

32:44.005 --> 32:48.452
would have been your junior year? After your two 
years at Tarleton. Why did you decide on A&M, and

32:52.465 --> 33:00.015
why didn't you try to transfer into MIT or some 
other engineering school? Well, I'd already

33:00.035 --> 33:01.277
picked A&M. I was going to A&M. Why? Well, I had a lot 
of friends that were going there, too, and I had

33:07.405 --> 33:16.617
already decided that's where I wanted to go. I was 
going to MIT for Masters. Okay. Can you describe

33:20.856 --> 33:25.220
the accommodations when you arrived? Where'd you 
stay at, Andrew? I stayed in Goodwin Hall in a

33:28.043 --> 33:31.867
triple-decker bunk. A triple-decker? I had two of 
my friends from Tarleton there with me, and we were

33:34.891 --> 33:42.739
junior fish, which is not a very savory position 
and enjoy at that time. It may be better now, but it

33:47.986 --> 33:51.591
was horrible then. You had a heavy course load and 
you did everything a freshman did. Sure. What

33:57.680 --> 33:58.982
about employment? Did you work while you

33:59.002 --> 34:05.211
were at A&M? No. How were you supported? How could 
you afford to pay for it? My father My father sent

34:09.888 --> 34:11.951
me. So by that time you had your father's business 
had been covered enough so he- Oh yeah. It had been

34:17.719 --> 34:22.125
covered in early 30's. Now, what corps outfit were 
you assigned? I was an A company

34:25.429 --> 34:34.201
infantry. Did you enjoy being in the corps? Yes, I 
did. What were some of the things that you enjoyed

34:39.537 --> 34:43.942
about it? Well, I enjoyed the

34:43.962 --> 34:59.319
friendship and the association

34:43.962 --> 34:59.319
with the individuals. The spirit permeated the 
whole mountain. We thought we were the best.

35:08.326 --> 35:09.467
Nobody could tell the difference. Were there any 
things that you disliked about being in the court?

35:15.514 --> 35:20.940
Well, I didn't like being a freshman.

35:20.960 --> 35:30.991
In other words, you didn't like servicing the, uh, 
ugliness of the nightly seniors, some of them who

35:20.960 --> 35:30.991
were younger than I was. Sure. What about hazing? I 
had all I wanted. but I had had a year of it at

35:38.380 --> 35:46.311
Tarleton.

35:46.331 --> 35:48.954
Can you compare the hazing of Ann and Tarleton? 
About the same, except we didn't have the...

35:56.785 --> 36:01.872
There wasn't as much of the room

35:56.785 --> 36:01.872
cleaning. Was there as much as we didn't have? We 
only had one dormitory there, and it was a brand new

36:04.675 --> 36:07.459
one. I went

36:08.080 --> 36:22.155
in when I was a freshman.

36:26.300 --> 36:28.622
I lived in a rooming house. I was the only one who 
lived in that rooming house. Then when I went into

36:31.085 --> 36:32.727
the dormitory, everything was worked out from 
there. By the time we got to the upperclassmen, we

36:32.747 --> 36:34.088
had a few things going. Everybody had to be in the 
military there. Sure. No question about it. Did

36:44.305 --> 36:50.535
they use the board as much at Tarleton as they did at 
A&M? A physical hazing. Well, they used the Sam

36:51.757 --> 36:53.801
Brown belt both places.

36:56.826 --> 36:58.609
I don't know if you're familiar with the Sam Brown 
belt. No, I'm not. Tell me about the belt. and they

37:03.110 --> 37:17.127
had holes in it and it'll make it really tear you up 
in the rear, turn you purple, blue, orange, green,

37:03.110 --> 37:17.127
any color you wanted. Let's compare the type of 
hazing at A&M and West Point.

37:24.616 --> 37:30.923
It was very similar, except there was no physical 
hazing.

37:32.388 --> 37:35.933
They weren't allowed to touch you at West Point. 
They did not beat you. That's not to say there

37:38.116 --> 37:44.445
couldn't be rifle exercises until you passed out. 
And did they do that? Oh, yeah. Pushing the piece

37:46.248 --> 37:51.576
and things like that? Yeah. Plenty of similarity.

37:55.061 --> 38:02.091
The toughest warning at West Point was the needles 
that you had to sit at attention. Keep

38:04.079 --> 38:28.578
your eyes on the blood, not look up. Keep your 
posture in a very stiff, erect position. It's not

38:29.620 --> 38:29.941
very... I think they've cut that out now, so they 
allow me to be made to sit up. So, in

38:32.311 --> 38:59.078
other words, the hazing at A&M and at West Point 
were similar in the mental hazing. Same types of

39:00.138 --> 39:03.341
demands? Well, there are even more demands

39:03.361 --> 39:22.821
that West Palm would say, insofar as the mental

39:03.361 --> 39:22.821
is concerned, because you haven't memorized a 
bunch of stories. They can call on you at any time to

39:22.841 --> 39:24.743
recite them, and if you need more of them, they can 
set up. They might allow you a few seconds, a few

39:24.763 --> 39:26.365
minutes to eat, and that would be all. and at A&M the 
difference was that we had the physical and there

39:29.264 --> 39:39.154
was no physical hazing at West Point.

39:42.898 --> 39:48.524
What was your opinion of hazing both at A&M and then 
at West Point? I thought it had a place

39:48.544 --> 39:54.090
and a lot of it was good. And what was it? Tell me 
about the place that it is. Well, they had what they

39:59.165 --> 40:13.045
called clothing formations, and you'd have to run 
upstairs and change your clothes and get back and

39:59.165 --> 40:13.045
do the last one

39:59.165 --> 40:13.045
when you got in trouble. And this is at 
Westmoreland? Yeah. And it taught you to change

40:14.868 --> 40:23.200
clothes in a hurry and get them right, because if 
you went down there wrong, you had to go back and it

40:14.868 --> 40:23.200
ended up with lots of problems. And I really had

40:23.872 --> 40:36.926
no problem with it because I'd been through what 
I'd had to talk and what I'd had to answer. And I had

40:36.947 --> 40:37.787
no trouble memorizing the stuff. I had no trouble 
in the formations I'd ever had to be in, the violent

40:37.807 --> 40:39.690
stuff. Some of them I had to go through because we 
had troubles. What do you mean violent? Well...

40:53.505 --> 40:53.625
The... more stressful situations maybe violent 
is too strong a word more stressful situations

40:53.842 --> 41:23.646
because what they were doing is trying to create a 
stress situation which occurs in all military

40:53.842 --> 41:23.646
under stress and try to put you in a stress 
situation and get you so that you know how to react

40:53.842 --> 41:23.646
under a stress situation and

40:53.842 --> 41:23.646
i think that's good it's not overdone and it also 
teach you attention to

41:24.487 --> 41:46.630
detail, and teach you to take care of your parents, 
and if they found a spot on you, boy, you'd get on for

41:24.487 --> 41:46.630
that, or something like that. It's a good mental 
training. What about the, in other words, you're

41:48.592 --> 41:53.437
saying that hazing teaches you discipline. 
That's right. What about,

41:56.414 --> 42:12.831
this question, in what way do you think being in the 
Corps, both at Tarleton and A&M, helped you at West

41:56.414 --> 42:12.831
Point and later in your career? Well, I knew, I 
would say this, that I knew close order drill as

42:14.412 --> 42:22.741
well as the ones that were trying to teach it to me up 
there. It was not better because I had more of it

42:22.961 --> 42:25.864
than they had.

42:43.748 --> 43:01.633
Actually, I didn't have any, and also I didn't have 
any new subjects there for the first three years

42:43.748 --> 43:01.633
except for French, which I hadn't

42:43.748 --> 43:01.633
had before. So it was relatively easy for me, and I 
was coaching my classmates who were having

43:01.653 --> 43:05.419
problems. So in other words, you had a good 
preparation here in Texas before? Yes, sir.

43:11.558 --> 43:13.160
before you went to West Point. I said, well, I think 
it's a waste of time. They don't do that anymore.

43:17.868 --> 43:20.291
They give people credit, and they take other 
courses. They have a curriculum now that's not so

43:20.512 --> 43:24.718
high-balanced. Everybody had to take the same 
thing. That's what it was when I went there.

43:29.365 --> 43:30.787
Everybody had to take the same thing. In other 
words, when you went to West Point, the credits

43:30.807 --> 43:34.733
that you took at A&M didn't transfer? It meant 
nothing. No kidding. Absolutely nothing. Well,

43:41.917 --> 43:43.623
were you a little irritated by that? Well, not 
really. It didn't make any difference. It didn't

43:50.547 --> 43:51.872
take any more. I was going to have to be there.

44:10.250 --> 44:14.957
I don't think I read the

44:10.250 --> 44:14.957
interview. What about the quality of military 
training at A&M versus military training at West

44:14.977 --> 44:29.258
Point?

44:29.278 --> 44:38.772
Well,

44:29.278 --> 44:38.772
insofar as, as I said, close artillery and things 
like that, A&M is better. But in the other

44:39.697 --> 44:55.375
subjects, your military training at A&M didn't go 
as deep or cover as many subjects because you

44:39.697 --> 44:55.375
covered only the infantry. I was in the infantry. 
Up there we covered the whole gamut. We studied

44:59.560 --> 45:06.328
every one of the services, each individual 
service.

45:10.595 --> 45:13.057
I didn't go to the field training at A&M. I went to 
the CMTC, which is, I guess, similar. We had field

45:21.464 --> 45:37.718
training in the summer, which was a lot more

45:21.464 --> 45:37.718
realistic training . What about the engineering 
courses that you took? As I said, the first three

45:41.206 --> 45:46.974
years, I didn't have engineering courses, and 
it's almost the same.

45:50.899 --> 45:52.300
Which one did you enjoy more?

45:57.647 --> 46:00.591
Well, you've got to put that in perspective. I 
enjoyed them both. But did you enjoy the one you

46:03.315 --> 46:04.857
finished most? Sure. There was no question about 
that. The year you enjoy most is the senior year,

46:10.248 --> 46:14.533
and I never had a senior year. Oh, that's true. At 
A&M, I had a good year, but it left some things to be

46:15.655 --> 46:33.076
desired in terms of freedom, relationships.

46:33.096 --> 46:33.837
Oh, would you explain? Well, if you're a junior 
fish, you're doing nothing. It's not a great deal
