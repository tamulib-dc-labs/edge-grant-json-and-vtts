00:02.005 --> 00:17.103
This is January 11, 1981, an interview with Tom 
Wetzel, landscape architect, graduate of Texas

00:02.005 --> 00:17.103
A&M in the Department of Urban and Regional 
Planning, as well as the Department of Landscape

00:02.005 --> 00:17.103
Architecture. Tom has been living in Austin for 
three years, and it's with this in mind and his

00:19.205 --> 00:30.358
particular perception of the physical 
environment that he may be able to provide a

00:30.929 --> 00:43.268
particular insight into the planning process in 
Austin as he has come to know it. Tom, would you like

00:44.249 --> 00:55.306
to give us a bit of information about your firm, 
perhaps to begin with, and the project that you've

00:44.249 --> 00:55.306
been working on for Austin? That might be a good 
place to begin.

01:02.131 --> 01:06.477
I'm with Myrick Newman-Dahlberg, who are 
landscape architects and urban planners. We are

01:07.419 --> 01:22.521
presently working on a project titled the Lower 
Waller Creek Development, which is a city project

01:07.419 --> 01:22.521
of the redevelopment of the Waller Creek segment 
between 11th Street and Town Lake. This segment of

01:23.843 --> 01:28.830
the creek has been historically basically a 
sewer. And the objective is to develop a hike and

01:29.317 --> 01:40.855
bike trail promenade walkway from Symphony 
Square at 11th Street to Town Lake. The project was

01:41.957 --> 01:57.501
begun in approximately 1975 with authorization 
from the Friedman Council to develop a

01:41.957 --> 01:57.501
comprehensive study of the entire area that would 
develop a direction for planning and

01:57.700 --> 02:07.770
opportunities, or at least to point out 
opportunities, in this eastern side of the

01:57.700 --> 02:07.770
Central Business District. The project 
progressed through 1975 with the culmination of a

02:09.812 --> 02:25.868
planning study by the joint venture consultants 
of Myrick, Newman, Dahlberg, Taniguchi,

02:09.812 --> 02:25.868
Scheffelman, Minter, Vacker, and Fries and 
Nichols. The three consultants, landscape

02:26.675 --> 02:44.115
architects, architects and engineers,

02:26.675 --> 02:44.115
developed a comprehensive plan for the Lower Wall 
Creek area, which included all aspects of urban

02:26.675 --> 02:44.115
design.

02:48.160 --> 02:54.387
The project is now under its first phase of 
construction, which is approximately a 1.5

02:54.890 --> 03:03.421
million dollar bond funds used by the city for this 
particular project. No federal funds are

03:03.441 --> 03:05.003
involved. Subsequent phases of the project would 
include flood water diversion and other

03:06.885 --> 03:17.939
amenities along the creek. Already there has been 
a increase in the activity of real estate along the

03:21.400 --> 03:43.462
creek as more and more local developers realize 
the potential of the creek area once the city has

03:21.400 --> 03:43.462
taken the initial step to clean up and to provide 
some amenities that will attract local residents

03:21.400 --> 03:43.462
to the area. Thomas, could you go into the origins 
of the project? The spark plugged the thing

03:51.421 --> 03:54.485
initially. Was it an individual or a commission? 
And who do you report to as a consortium in City

03:57.569 --> 04:02.575
Hall? Who is managing the project for the city? The 
initial planning on the project occurred prior to

04:09.704 --> 04:15.852
my employment with Myrick Newman Dahlberg. And so 
I guess I'm truthfully only sketchy on those

04:16.613 --> 04:20.938
details. The potential of Waller Creek has been a 
famous or infamous planning and architecture

04:21.340 --> 04:48.546
study for the University of Texas architecture 
department for many, many years, as well as the

04:21.340 --> 04:48.546
town lake development was, similar to the large 
Trinity Lake proposal for downtown Dallas, where

04:21.340 --> 04:48.546
they would redevelop the Trinity River channel. 
So the history of the project, I guess, probably

04:49.083 --> 04:54.830
goes back maybe 40 years in Austin's history. 
People have been concerned about the creek. But it

04:58.414 --> 05:11.369
wasn't until the Friedman Council, who was 
probably the most environmentally oriented

04:58.414 --> 05:11.369
council that this city has ever seen, it wasn't 
until that council that real action and steps were

04:58.414 --> 05:11.369
taken. As far as us as consultants, Our dealings 
from the planning stage through this

05:15.627 --> 05:33.383
construction phase have been basically with 
originally what was called the Building

05:15.627 --> 05:33.383
Construction Department, which is now part of 
Public Works, and the prime client is the Parks and

05:15.627 --> 05:33.383
Recreation Department. In fact, any kinds of 
changes during this construction phase, we first

05:33.650 --> 05:49.968
consult with Parks and Recreation as to our 
recommendation, and basically Public Works is a

05:33.650 --> 05:49.968
functionary and sees that it occurs, you know, the 
actual construction. Very good. There has been,

05:52.718 --> 06:02.190
since the early planning stages of the project in 
75, there has been a change in the city council.

06:02.631 --> 06:09.119
There has been a tremendous change in the city 
council as far as direction and their interest or

06:02.631 --> 06:09.119
concern about development. And there has been a 
change within the city staff of reorganization

06:09.960 --> 06:19.513
nature, which has really complicated the project 
as far as consultants are concerned. And many of

06:19.633 --> 06:22.236
the city staff who originally had provided 
planning direction are no longer with the city or

06:22.587 --> 06:51.919
have changed departments completely and have 
nothing to do with it and this as consultants

06:22.587 --> 06:51.919
frequently leaves us out in the cold in trying to 
either justify a particular design decision or

06:22.587 --> 06:51.919
whatever the circumstance may be it's not 
necessarily a perfect working arrangement

06:22.587 --> 06:51.919
well Thomas,

06:52.810 --> 07:19.948
going on to the major planning thrust of Austin, 
taking a look at what has been happening in the

06:52.810 --> 07:19.948
recent past that you feel comfortable and 
knowledgeable about discussing, would you care

06:52.810 --> 07:19.948
to comment on the character of the planning 
activities in Austin with regard to any aspects of

07:20.907 --> 07:39.586
it that might occur to you, such as 
transportation, environmental quality, growth

07:20.907 --> 07:39.586
control, growth management, new industry, human 
services, whatever might be indicated. It

07:41.889 --> 07:49.817
appears that the planning department in Austin, 
the city function of planning, has a very low

07:41.889 --> 07:49.817
profile.

07:50.084 --> 08:18.015
functions it appears to me to be rather 
reactionary and their direction seems to come

07:50.084 --> 08:18.015
solely from the council at the council's whim for 
instance there we do have a comprehensive plan

07:50.084 --> 08:18.015
which like many plans in texas has no real teeth to 
it and despite what the plan says the city is still

07:50.084 --> 08:18.015
building utilities to sensitive environmental 
areas. So there doesn't seem to be much, although

08:21.845 --> 08:44.172
the planning department exists and they do 
recommend basically zoning change, zoning

08:21.845 --> 08:44.172
change recommendations and subdivisions and 
they seem to want to check to make sure that the

08:21.845 --> 08:44.172
subdivision applicant has applied and has 
crossed all his I's and dotted all his T's. But they

08:49.085 --> 08:51.967
really don't do much planning. Austin is a 
desirable city to live in. Everyone comments

08:54.650 --> 09:10.325
about its environmental quality but from my 
viewpoint that is only pure circumstance and

08:54.650 --> 09:10.325
there is nothing within the city to protect what we 
have. There is no ordinance which that controls

09:13.244 --> 09:16.327
the cutting of trees. There is a landscape 
ordinance which only speaks to putting grass and

09:17.508 --> 09:27.618
not covering a property from one property line to 
another with asphalt. That's all it requires is

09:27.838 --> 09:30.720
that the property not be totally covered. So 
you're drawing the distinction between the

09:31.421 --> 09:37.467
natural resource environment and the man-made 
environment. Well, yes. I understand what you

09:40.930 --> 09:43.032
mean by that question. What I'm saying is... When 
you're saying that Austin is considered by

09:45.263 --> 09:53.873
everyone to be desirable, you say it's a matter of 
circumstance or happenstance. Yes. The hills are

09:54.674 --> 09:56.436
beautiful. Yeah, there's a natural resource 
base. Right. Yeah. But then man has not done much to

09:59.339 --> 10:05.406
accommodate an enhancement of that. Certainly 
not when the city council, as recommended by the

10:05.426 --> 10:11.533
planning department, approves... a large 
shopping center to be built in the southwest

10:11.733 --> 10:15.198
hills. And they have scalped the top of the hills 
and have two to one slopes that can never be

10:15.298 --> 10:25.692
maintained and have totally destroyed one of the 
natural scenic features. Which area? It's all the

10:26.473 --> 10:28.155
things we came here for. Many of them are going to be 
quickly destroyed. Is there any way to identify

10:31.480 --> 10:33.923
that area? Oh, sure. It's all been identified. I 
mean, but what does it have a name? Yeah, it does,

10:39.543 --> 10:40.804
really. It's Barton Creek Mall or whatever it is. 
And it's a Melvin Simons shopping center

10:44.369 --> 10:48.193
development. And you've seen that shopping 
center over in College Station that they're

10:49.334 --> 10:54.621
developing. And of course, the easiest way, most 
cost efficient way to develop a shopping center is

10:54.641 --> 11:00.428
to mow down everything and flatten the site. And 
when you're trying to do that in the southwest

11:01.068 --> 11:04.612
hills of Austin, that's very difficult to do. Is 
that the Tennessee firm? No, they're from Ohio.

11:07.656 --> 11:08.036
Ohio. Yeah. But it just seems like there are no real 
protections. And planning is pretty weak. If the

11:19.238 --> 11:25.144
mayor wants to see that something gets done, 
she'll see that it gets done and be damned with what

11:19.238 --> 11:25.144
the general plan says. Although the general plan 
is very environmentally concerned. And the

11:32.370 --> 11:39.857
general plan was, I think, done in a very, very good 
way, from what I understand, in terms of citizen

11:32.370 --> 11:39.857
participation. And that general plan speaks to a 
north-south development corridor for Austin,

11:40.394 --> 11:45.139
period. And you wouldn't see the city trying to put 
sewer and water lines to the southwest hills if

11:46.120 --> 12:02.817
there was any control over departments that meant 
that the department needed to comply with,

11:46.120 --> 12:02.817
generally speaking, with the general plan. So the 
plan says this, but their policy is we go ahead and

12:08.407 --> 12:10.189
do business over here as usual. How many, how big a 
line do you want? Do you have any responses to the

12:14.275 --> 12:26.092
transportation system, circulation system of 
Austin?

12:26.112 --> 12:33.442
In terms of airports, freeways, thoroughfares, 
city streets, just getting around Austin, is that

12:26.112 --> 12:33.442
an easy thing to do? It's not really. The 41st 
Street, 38th and 1⁄2 Street, 35th Street corridor

12:38.005 --> 13:00.765
going east and west was identified years ago in a 
transportation plan as being a major, developed

12:38.005 --> 13:00.765
into a, upgraded into a major thoroughfare to sort 
of for crosstown traffic. And the citizens didn't

13:01.426 --> 13:02.787
want that. And I'm not sure it ever got there. so far 
as to be any kind of conflict, but it never has been

13:07.064 --> 13:10.428
done. And I'm not sure that it ever will. The 
freeway, the Mopac Freeway, which is nearing its

13:13.931 --> 13:35.535
completion, or at least what they say is going to be 
the completed portion of it or the completed

13:13.931 --> 13:35.535
length of it, that has provided north-south

13:13.931 --> 13:35.535
transportation in the western part of the city, 
and Interstate 35 fills that same function in the

13:36.916 --> 13:44.363
east part of the city. In the north, there is 
Highway 183, which badly needs to be upgraded to a

13:45.064 --> 13:50.750
freeway standard. Unfortunately, it really 
does. And that's a function of the building permit

13:52.852 --> 13:58.117
process and zoning changes. In other words, the 
city policy was to go ahead and allow all these

13:58.237 --> 14:06.906
businesses and subdivisions to develop out 
there, but all they had going to it was a four-lane

13:58.237 --> 14:06.906
highway. with traffic lights and curb cuts. What 
about Ben and White? Ben and White sort of the same

14:12.290 --> 14:13.471
way. It serves as a major thoroughfare, but it 
really almost needs to be a freeway. So they sort of

14:22.220 --> 14:24.682
built what was improper. And especially with a 
policy that says we'll approve any subdivision

14:26.044 --> 14:31.610
you want to build out here. So there doesn't seem to 
be much coordination, again, between the

14:36.265 --> 14:48.538
function of transportation planning, and the 
permit process to build something.

14:48.558 --> 14:54.565
Tom, a city like Austin always has several 
projects going. And Austin is, by Texas

14:54.625 --> 14:58.769
standards, an all city. And presumably, they have 
small districts that need attention. Could you

15:04.801 --> 15:15.814
describe perhaps some of the projects that are 
underway now that the city looks forward to

15:04.801 --> 15:15.814
benefiting by upgrading and rehabbing and so 
forth? Well, probably the most outstanding

15:18.077 --> 15:33.475
feature of Austin is from an urban design 
standpoint and a historical standpoint as well is

15:18.077 --> 15:33.475
Congress Avenue and the entire downtown area. 
many buildings dating to some of the very early

15:33.893 --> 15:40.942
structures built in Austin. Many of which are 
undergoing adaptive reuse and at the same time

15:41.743 --> 15:54.280
others are demised by the arson's torch. So we have 
some very strange things happening in downtown

15:55.361 --> 15:59.046
Austin. But probably the most

16:03.695 --> 16:09.203
prominent in the last couple of years has been the 
Congress Avenue redevelopment. Congress Avenue

16:10.665 --> 16:15.752
is a broad six-lane street leading directly to the 
state capitol. And there is a magnificent vista

16:16.573 --> 16:24.905
from the South Congress across the Colorado River 
to the capitol at the terminus of the avenue. The

16:27.328 --> 16:29.972
street in And almost just before the turn of the 
century, it was still a dirt street. And despite

16:36.603 --> 16:43.994
the fact that they had some rather grand buildings 
built along the side of the avenue. But over a

16:45.657 --> 16:50.764
period of years, everything seemed to get paved 
and sidewalks were built. And what we ended up with

16:50.865 --> 16:59.217
was a rather dismal urban space leading to the most 
important structure in the state. So about five

17:01.390 --> 17:11.242
years or so ago, and I believe this may have been 
also under the Friedman Council, which was a very

17:01.390 --> 17:11.242
active council, doing a lot of good things, it 
seems. But they approved a renovation plan for

17:12.704 --> 17:16.929
Congress Avenue. And the plan included several 
different phases. One of the most important ones

17:20.693 --> 17:27.381
was flood control due to poor drainage 
conditions. the avenue and buildings that had

17:27.614 --> 17:32.020
basements would frequently flood. And so when I 
first came to Austin three years ago, they were

17:32.060 --> 17:41.311
just completing a giant storm sewer down the 
middle of Congress Avenue. One would have thought

17:42.012 --> 17:49.402
they might have considered the inclusion of a 
rapid rail transit while they had the city street

17:42.012 --> 17:49.402
open, but they didn't. That obviously was not part 
of the picture. Or planned it maybe. Yes, they

17:54.768 --> 17:56.811
hadn't planned that at all. So at any rate, at this 
point, approximately six months ago, the city had

17:57.432 --> 18:16.656
completed an urban streetscape plan for Congress 
Avenue, which included trees and so forth, and

17:57.432 --> 18:16.656
widened sidewalks, other street amenities that 
might be appropriate for a grand avenue leading to

18:16.906 --> 18:21.591
the state capitol. Benches and drinking 
fountains and a small kiosk and a new sign system

18:23.132 --> 18:36.906
and traffic lights and so forth, all of which was to 
be designed, which was to be in keeping and to

18:23.132 --> 18:36.906
harmonize and so forth with the urban area. The 
plans were completed by an architecture firm.

18:44.581 --> 18:59.096
At the same time, it became knowledge of the 
general public that in order to accomplish the

18:44.581 --> 18:59.096
widened sidewalks and so forth, they were going to 
have to eliminate two lanes of traffic. One lane in

18:59.276 --> 19:01.018
each direction. One lane in each direction would 
be eliminated. And this would accommodate the

19:03.681 --> 19:14.132
construction of tree wells and so forth, because 
many of the buildings have basements that extend

19:03.681 --> 19:14.132
out to the street curb under the sidewalk. So in 
order to make everything consistent, we had to

19:14.838 --> 19:17.983
move out. There were a number of downtown 
merchants who organized a campaign to not accept

19:20.226 --> 19:38.495
this particular plan, not to narrow the streets, 
not to eliminate approximately 50 or 60 parking

19:20.226 --> 19:38.495
places, which was going to have to occur. Their 
basis, of course, was they were afraid they were

19:39.156 --> 19:43.022
going to lose business. If one would walk down 
Congress Avenue, you would quickly identify

19:43.171 --> 19:58.432
Congress as a dying downtown business street with 
a lot of discount drugstores and other rather

19:43.171 --> 19:58.432
low-class types of businesses. There are a few 
good stores that have hung on, such as

19:59.734 --> 20:04.861
Scarborough's and so forth. This avenue also has 
several banks that face on it. And several of the

20:07.265 --> 20:13.093
banks also felt that they didn't want to see the 
street narrowed. you have to be familiar with the

20:13.445 --> 20:31.591
Texas banking laws to realize that a branch bank or 
a drive-in bank has to be within 500 feet or a

20:13.445 --> 20:31.591
thousand feet, some ridiculous distance close to 
the main bank, and therefore of course they were

20:13.445 --> 20:31.591
concerned that their customers would have 
difficulty getting to their drive-in bank.

20:32.652 --> 20:34.455
That's why they were opposed to it. So at any rate, 
what happened was the city, despite all the

20:35.316 --> 20:42.186
controversy and even controversy on the council, 
the mayor wanted to block off a street with

20:42.352 --> 20:49.923
barricades and pretend like we had widened the 
sidewalks and see if we had a traffic problem.

20:49.943 --> 20:53.267
Because the big hue and cry is, oh, we don't have any 
place for the automobiles to go. Well, in fact,

20:53.788 --> 20:57.453
Congress, although it's a grand avenue, really 
doesn't go anyplace. It's dead end at the capital

20:59.596 --> 21:01.939
end, so to speak. And included in the plan, 
incidentally, was the changing of bus routes and

21:02.560 --> 21:07.727
so forth. And, of course, the re-signaling and the 
total thing. And at any rate, finally this group

21:11.680 --> 21:28.537
that opposed the whole plan, led by the merchants, 
decided that the only way they were going to stop

21:11.680 --> 21:28.537
the Congress Avenue renovation and the narrowing 
of the street, which was their point of

21:11.680 --> 21:28.537
contention, was to get up a referendum. And they 
were successful in getting the 25% signatures of

21:28.557 --> 21:36.085
the last number of voters in an Austin election. 
and presented their petition to the council, and

21:36.402 --> 21:43.208
their petition, the names were verified and so 
forth. So the council was faced with either

21:43.228 --> 21:54.179
stopping the project totally or perhaps 
submitting it to the voters in the February

21:43.228 --> 21:54.179
election. The council chose to, oh, the council 
had also accepted, had already advertised the

21:54.840 --> 22:04.789
project for bid, and the bids had been received. 
The lowest bid was some million dollars over what

22:05.512 --> 22:14.665
the city had in hand that was actually earmarked 
for Congress Avenue. However, there were other

22:16.087 --> 22:25.981
funds because it became prudent to include 
certain other types of renovation, for instance,

22:16.087 --> 22:25.981
the streetlight wiring system and so forth. And so 
there were funds available from other city

22:26.001 --> 22:33.392
coffers to take up the difference. But at any rate, 
what has happened is the project has been stopped

22:33.946 --> 22:37.970
at this point. But I guess the interesting thing is 
not that Congress Avenue renovation has been

22:38.010 --> 22:51.903
thwarted by merchants who failed to see the 
benefits of it, which is partially true. But in my

22:52.523 --> 22:55.406
view, I'm actually glad that it has stopped. 
Because what Austin does not have, getting back to

22:55.646 --> 23:02.232
planning, is that Austin does not have a downtown 
plan. Downtown is treated no differently than any

23:02.870 --> 23:10.056
other part of the city, and yet it functions in a 
very special way. And if one is going to try to

23:10.136 --> 23:20.545
improve the conditions in the central business 
district, then there needs to be a plan from which

23:10.136 --> 23:20.545
one works from. And you don't attack Congress 
Avenue as a separate and distinctive part of the

23:20.565 --> 23:28.152
downtown area. It's part of the downtown area. The 
city has... A southeast corner of downtown is

23:32.620 --> 23:47.843
what's called the Rainy Street area, and in that 
area there are a lot of Chicano homes, and oh,

23:32.620 --> 23:47.843
probably about 40 or 50 of them, and many of them 
have been divided into apartments and so forth.

23:48.604 --> 23:52.711
And so the Rainy Street area is part of downtown 
Austin. Austin has the problem with the railroad

23:53.532 --> 23:58.039
tracks downtown, and they have done a separate 
study on the railroad tracks. They have...

24:00.683 --> 24:09.376
conditions along 6th Street and its potential 
business area of historic interest and

24:00.683 --> 24:09.376
significance. That's a separate area. So I guess 
what I'm saying is that... Where the Briscoe Hotel

24:11.600 --> 24:14.324
is. Right, yes. So what I'm saying is that here they 
are. They're talking about this thing downtown.

24:18.770 --> 24:22.336
They're talking about this thing downtown and 
this thing downtown, but they don't even have a

24:18.770 --> 24:22.336
plan. And so what I say is we should first do a 
downtown plan Oh, this also relates to about two

24:27.430 --> 24:41.253
years ago when the city council authorized, 
without real much public knowledge, a downtown

24:27.430 --> 24:41.253
redevelopment plan for the area from 3rd through 
1st Street, which was the American Cities Plan. So

24:41.894 --> 24:43.016
here are all these issues. There's the American 
Cities Plan and the ire that that arrived. That

24:45.520 --> 24:47.424
fell flat on its face. Yes, exactly. And they've 
got a real problem with this Rainey Street area

24:49.047 --> 24:58.100
because of the Chicano community and their 
feeling that they have a right to that part of

24:49.047 --> 24:58.100
downtown. You have the conditions along 6th 
Street, which clearly need to be brought under

24:59.462 --> 25:07.473
control in terms of parking and other conditions 
along the avenue. You have the Congress Avenue

25:08.074 --> 25:12.220
controversy and problems. So here we have a whole 
number of issues that all are downtown. Oh, the

25:15.348 --> 25:15.989
railroads. What are we going to do about the 
railroads? We're going to get rid of the railroads

25:17.231 --> 25:20.996
and utilize that area in some other way. So you have 
a whole bunch of problems down there that have

25:21.536 --> 25:26.823
never been attacked from a planning standpoint at 
all. Certainly not comprehensively. And we just

25:28.725 --> 25:30.508
do a little bit here, a little bit there. And these 
little tries you see fail. It seems to me that

25:34.653 --> 25:41.802
downtown Austin has an interesting 
juxtaposition of... features such as Town Lake

25:42.001 --> 25:49.552
with the beautiful lake, a civic auditorium on one 
side. It has a park strip that runs along it, which

25:50.874 --> 25:54.219
is ideal. It is not that far away from the state 
capitol. It is adjacent to the CBD. All of these

26:01.690 --> 26:08.059
things come together, and this is going to cause 
some pressure for certain types of development.

26:08.663 --> 26:11.987
which may or may not be in the long-range interests 
of the citizens of Austin. And it's going to be

26:13.289 --> 26:23.301
interesting to see how the area immediately 
adjacent to Turner Lake on the North Shore is

26:13.289 --> 26:23.301
redeveloped in the coming decades. What would be 
the objective of that particular area for

26:25.083 --> 26:33.434
redevelopment south, for example, of where the 
railroad tracks are now? Well, it has a... Right

26:36.625 --> 26:39.388
now, there's no demand for it. That's probably the 
saving grace. But at the same time, there's also no

26:42.052 --> 26:45.616
plan for it. And I suppose that several planning 
postures

26:46.077 --> 26:54.567
would be obvious. And probably the major one that 
would relate best to the lake and that amenity

26:54.687 --> 27:05.080
would be the development of residential, highly 
residential in the first couple of blocks along

27:05.549 --> 27:08.977
Town Lake. A city where the same kind of conditions 
sort of exist would be the shoreline along Lake

27:10.140 --> 27:17.196
Michigan in Chicago. where there was a heavy 
concentration along the North Shore of

27:17.530 --> 27:23.018
residential use. Now, obviously, there's quite a 
bit of difference between Lake Michigan and Town

27:23.940 --> 27:31.811
Lake and Chicago and Austin, Texas. So maybe we're 
talking about small townhouse types of

27:33.253 --> 27:42.407
structures, two and three story, which would fit 
in quite well. with an area of green developed

27:42.843 --> 28:08.698
along the lake and then you move closer to north 
toward the capital and you get into the central

27:42.843 --> 28:08.698
business district where there are offices and 
other businesses where many of the people living

27:42.843 --> 28:08.698
in this area work so you have the possibility for a 
very concentrated pretty pedestrian oriented

27:42.843 --> 28:08.698
downtown austin and in fact you have two um nice 
amenities of both sort of the north and south end of

28:09.100 --> 28:12.623
downtown Austin. You have the Capitol on one side 
and you have Town Lake on the other. And with the

28:16.227 --> 28:23.614
Shoal Creek Hike and Bike Trail and the Waller 
Creek Hike and Bike Trail, you have two nice

28:16.227 --> 28:23.614
pedestrian things that bring you all the way down. 
So there are, you know, some good potential. But

28:27.097 --> 28:38.128
the only interest so far along Town Lake has been, 
for instance, the Holiday Inn wanted to exchange

28:27.097 --> 28:38.128
parkland for money with the city and take part of 
the town lake to build another high rise tower and a

28:38.513 --> 28:45.902
parking garage. Fortunately, that idea just 
really met with disdain. And it would have set a

28:50.967 --> 28:57.355
very dangerous precedent for the city to have even 
a long term lease arrangement. That's what the

28:57.375 --> 29:01.199
hotel said, we'll buy it, we'll lease it from you, 
we just want this land. It just happened to be park.

29:03.802 --> 29:07.086
So, unfortunately that didn't happen.

29:09.395 --> 29:23.937
I think the main problem here is that there is no way 
that the general plan, although it is adopted,

29:09.395 --> 29:23.937
but it has no teeth in forcing the council to follow 
it. And I'm not quite sure of the actual procedure

29:24.538 --> 29:28.624
of adoption and what that means. I'm sure Dick 
Lilly can tell you. But the city council, there's

29:31.548 --> 29:35.194
nothing that forces the city council to do it. So a 
very good master plan. drawn up under a previous

29:38.875 --> 29:54.538
council who was very environmentally oriented, 
hits a council that is not environmentally

29:38.875 --> 29:54.538
oriented, but is oriented toward growth at 
whatever cost, oriented toward serving the

29:38.875 --> 29:54.538
development community. I know a developer who 
told me that when Friedman Council came in, he went

29:55.299 --> 30:01.688
to San Antonio, built houses down there for four 
years. And as soon as McTowell got in, he moved

30:01.728 --> 30:05.053
right back to Austin, because that's where he 
wanted to be. He just couldn't do business here

30:05.073 --> 30:08.578
with Friedman. I think that there's no way that the 
comprehensive plan can have any continuity to it,

30:08.778 --> 30:20.491
even if under the present conditions, because 
there's no way that it's continuous. It just

30:20.772 --> 30:24.356
depends on the council and which way they're going 
to look. I think Austin has a number of problems,

30:24.376 --> 30:34.127
because I don't think there's enough concern for 
the environment here that makes the city that

30:24.376 --> 30:34.127
people think of it as. It's a beautiful place to be, 
but gee, I can take you to a lot of places and you

30:37.458 --> 30:41.301
won't find it very pretty. And the things that are 
here are things that we're not even protecting.

30:46.786 --> 30:57.796
We're very happy to let Simon's build his mall out 
there that is over the aquifer that furnishes

30:46.786 --> 30:57.796
water for Barton Springs. And that much of the 
shopping center land drains to the Barton Springs

30:59.237 --> 31:04.182
watershed. And we're not even concerned about 
that. There has been some good activity in

31:08.656 --> 31:15.925
planning with regard to growth controls along 
Town Lake. And there has been, most recently, but

31:16.326 --> 31:28.701
only after real public assistance by private 
groups, say Barton Creek, Barton Springs, and

31:16.326 --> 31:28.701
other groups, has there been any control.
