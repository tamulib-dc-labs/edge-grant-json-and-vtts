WEBVTT

00:04.705 --> 00:13.116
On this date, August the 4th, 1987, we will have an 
interview with Dr. John Wilkins, Jr. of

00:04.705 --> 00:13.116
Greenville, Texas. Dr. Wilkins' father was 
president of the Texas Veterinary Medical

00:14.538 --> 00:24.571
Association in 1912 and was instrumental in 
passing the first Veterinary Licensing Act in

00:14.538 --> 00:24.571
Texas. Dr. Wilkins, Sr. was a member of the first 
Veterinary Examining Board, and Dr. Wilkins, Jr.

00:33.308 --> 00:34.750
has followed in his footsteps. Dr. Wilkins Jr. is a 
1949 graduate of Texas A&M University and has been

00:35.691 --> 00:44.060
a member of the Veterinary Examining Board for 
several terms. The interview will follow

00:46.583 --> 00:48.465
shortly.

00:55.493 --> 01:00.379
This afternoon, the fourth day of August 1987, 
it's our pleasure to be in the office of Dr. Johnny

01:01.203 --> 01:06.269
Wilkins, Jr., who is a very illustrious man in his 
own right. He has seen better in medicine from

01:06.289 --> 01:14.218
considerable of the early days, especially 
through his father. And I think that would be a nice

01:15.339 --> 01:19.644
place to begin our interview this afternoon. Tell 
us, Dr. Wilkins, about your father, his birth and

01:19.684 --> 01:28.594
his early bringing up and where it was and how it all 
came about. He's a native Kentuckian. He was born

01:31.853 --> 01:35.558
and raised in Murray, Kentucky. And as far as his 
schooling there, I'm not acquainted with it. I

01:41.466 --> 01:43.389
don't have the information. But he did attend

01:43.429 --> 01:52.301
undergraduate school in Tennessee. But I don't 
recall the... the name of the school, but you do

01:56.587 --> 02:02.898
have it on the vitae that I sent you. And then he came 
to Texas, taught school in Mayo Normal in

02:02.918 --> 02:15.439
Commerce, Texas, which is now East Texas State 
University. And he taught in the Oddfellas School

02:17.162 --> 02:21.970
in Cumbee, Texas. taught science and English, and 
there he married my mother, who was a student, and

02:23.941 --> 02:37.132
then from there he went to veterinary school in 
Indiana. Graduated about 19 and 8, I believe, 19

02:37.753 --> 02:42.677
and 8 or 19 and 10. So your mother was born in Cumbie? 
Yes. She came from Cumbie, yes. She was from

02:48.462 --> 02:50.404
Cumbie, yes. Did he tell you any of his experiences 
in medical school? No, if he did, Bob, it's been so

02:56.020 --> 03:06.970
long that, of course, he's been dead now since 52, 
which is 30-some odd years, and I wish I had him to

02:56.020 --> 03:06.970
talk to again. What year was he born again?

03:10.933 --> 03:11.834
Bob, I don't remember. I don't remember the date on 
it. Okay.

03:18.040 --> 03:23.044
If you didn't discuss his schooling, you didn't 
have any favorite school jokes to tell you? No. I'm

03:24.269 --> 03:28.576
sure he told them to me back years ago, but I've 
forgotten. I just don't recall that. School

03:33.324 --> 03:34.767
stories or whatever. Following his graduation, 
he came back to Texas. This was about 1910, right?

03:43.261 --> 03:44.263
Yes, about 1910. Looking back in the history of the 
Practice Act of Texas and the Texas Veterinary

03:50.560 --> 03:53.904
Medical Association. He was quite an active 
organization man from the start. Did he tell you

04:00.613 --> 04:05.820
anything about the Texas Veterinary Medical 
Association at that time, its beginnings?

04:08.083 --> 04:19.318
He did have, he was quite active in both the, I 
think, in the state association and he was quite

04:08.083 --> 04:19.318
active in the examining board holding license 
number three. And he and Mr. Sam Rayburn were very

04:20.581 --> 04:29.432
instrumental in getting the Practice Act 
approved through the legislature. And I remember

04:30.774 --> 04:37.302
a Dr. Cook that was also on the board at the time. 
That's the only name I remember. I believe he was

04:39.585 --> 04:41.668
from Paris, Texas. From Paris. I believe he was 
German origin, wasn't he? Didn't he come from

04:45.313 --> 04:45.953
Germany? I don't know. I never did know the man. All 
right. I don't know.

04:52.424 --> 04:59.772
your dad was, did he tell you anything about the 
struggles to get this practice act passed? I know

04:59.792 --> 05:01.754
there was quite a little opposition to it. Well, 
the opposition came primarily from the ranchers

05:01.934 --> 05:13.586
and I guess from the ranchers more so than the 
farmers, but the agricultural people opposed it

05:01.934 --> 05:13.586
at that time. I think primarily because of They 
didn't, well, I guess they didn't want a

05:17.568 --> 05:22.916
veterinarian to be licensed, or they wanted to do 
it themselves. Which we had a lot of, after the

05:23.457 --> 05:34.834
practice act, we had quite a few that were allowed 
to practice for five years, I believe, under

05:23.457 --> 05:34.834
grandfather clause. And

05:36.136 --> 05:43.968
at the end of the five year, then they weren't 
allowed to practice.

05:46.431 --> 05:46.832
So. It was quite a struggle getting it through the 
legislature. I know he told me a lot of times that

05:52.781 --> 06:11.685
the time he spent down there trying to get it and 
promote it through Mr. Rayburn,

05:52.781 --> 06:11.685
who was our representative, he was able to help get 
it through. At that time, he was representative in

06:12.446 --> 06:15.130
the state legislature. He went on from there to 
be... elected to Congress, he was extremely well

06:18.841 --> 06:24.829
thought of in your home district, wasn't he? Oh, 
yeah. He was Speaker of the House in state

06:26.291 --> 06:36.866
legislature at the time the Practice Act went 
through, and then he has since been Speaker of the

06:26.291 --> 06:36.866
House in Congress. Yes. Your dad in 1912 was 
President of the Texas Veterinary Medical

06:40.070 --> 06:44.656
Association. Right around that time, 11 and 12, 
the so-called two associations or the TVMA split

06:48.541 --> 06:53.890
into two associations. Did your dad mention 
anything about that back in those days? If he did, I

06:58.377 --> 07:00.240
don't remember. I don't remember. That was too 
long ago. I understood there was some jealousy

07:05.288 --> 07:11.758
over who'd be granted licenses and who was not and 
so forth and so on. I don't recall that, Bob. Your

07:17.819 --> 07:21.743
daddy took you along to his practice runs in the 
early days. What do you remember about those and

07:21.803 --> 07:26.588
the things that his experiences in practice? 
Well, the thing that strikes me most is the fact

07:26.608 --> 07:37.898
that we did a lot of surgery and a lot of things 
without the benefit of anesthesia that we use now.

07:39.420 --> 07:45.566
And it

07:39.420 --> 07:45.566
seems like every cow we went to see had milk fever. 
And we had to pump them up with a pumped the udder

07:48.025 --> 07:55.534
with a pump, and then graduated to an oxygen tank, 
which was great. But I think, looking back,

07:56.476 --> 08:07.009
probably we gave more of them mastitis with a car 
pump than we did good. I don't know, but it was

08:07.149 --> 08:14.438
remarkable the way they would get up after you'd 
inflated the other and tied it off with strings and

08:15.228 --> 08:23.777
I still don't know how it worked. What was your 
procedure? You put in a teat tube and then applied

08:24.899 --> 08:29.584
the pressure of that and inflated it? Put a teat 
tube in and had it hooked to just an automobile

08:29.644 --> 08:42.298
pump, hand pump, and that was my job was to run the 
pump and As soon as we'd get the udder inflated to

08:42.903 --> 09:04.587
tie it off, we'd use string from a pillowcase or 
whatever they had and tie it off, tie the teat off,

08:42.903 --> 09:04.587
and keep the pressure built up in the udder for a 
period, I don't know how long, probably 12 hours,

08:42.903 --> 09:04.587
something like that. You didn't have any teats 
drop off from poor circulation. I don't recall it

09:08.418 --> 09:10.500
if it did. I really wasn't worried about that. You 
had to be careful how tight you tied it. Yeah,

09:16.166 --> 09:17.907
that's right. I don't recall whether it did or not, 
but like I say, I wasn't too concerned about that at

09:18.027 --> 09:23.413
that time. I was 10, 12 years old. Back in those 
days, veterinary practice didn't consist much of

09:26.415 --> 09:32.181
herd management at all. It was more or less an 
emergency type practice, wasn't it? That's

09:35.865 --> 09:36.265
right, yes. What do you recall your daddy doing 
besides the inflations?

09:44.379 --> 09:47.044
Oh, I recall tree-finding horses. I recall

09:47.204 --> 09:51.571
cases of... I know one case he removed a piece of 
skin from a mule as big as a saddle blanket. This

10:00.767 --> 10:03.872
mule had some kind of a... Maybe it was a malignant 
tumor. I don't know what it was. But then I don't

10:07.419 --> 10:12.306
think we considered we were concerned about 
malignancy. But we would go out and castrate maybe

10:13.347 --> 10:24.844
25, 30 mules in the morning. Everybody would bring 
their mules into one central place. And we'd

10:28.669 --> 10:34.197
castrate mules most of the day.

10:36.522 --> 10:44.471
What did you use for topical anesthetic on those 
castrations in those days, topical antiseptic?

10:46.653 --> 10:55.943
I think he had some kind of a preparation that it 
was, I have his formula. It was made up of, I think, a

10:56.884 --> 11:02.310
little kerosene,

11:10.289 --> 11:19.823
Some kind of acid and...

11:10.289 --> 11:19.823
Oh, scarlet oil. Scarlet oil. Scarlet oil. That 
was the primary thing. That was the big thing.

11:24.289 --> 11:24.429
Yeah. Those mules get stiff afterwards or they get 
right out and move? No, they get up. They were hard

11:32.862 --> 11:36.567
to get down and they were glad to get up.

11:41.086 --> 11:42.828
Did you ever need to still kiss them out to 
anything? Yes. Yes, we did. But I never did get in on

11:46.092 --> 11:50.777
those very much. It was kind of a one-man job. The 
tree fighting, was that mostly to get exudate out

11:54.981 --> 11:58.005
of the sinuses? No, I think it was mostly for the 
fourth molar. Is that the one that causes the

12:03.711 --> 12:05.393
problem? To knock the molars out? Knock the molar 
out, yeah, with a punch. Yes. Yeah. Infected

12:11.292 --> 12:13.455
fourth tooth. Yeah. Fourth cheek tooth. Well,

12:16.879 --> 12:24.828
the day finally arrived when you could get through 
veterinary school and help. And tell us about your

12:24.849 --> 12:27.572
birth and so forth. When were you born? I was born in 
Greenville, Texas, September the 2nd, 1914.

12:35.481 --> 12:40.067
And I

12:35.481 --> 12:40.067
attended schools here. When I graduated from high 
school in 32, it was right in the middle of the

12:41.853 --> 12:47.020
Depression. The funds weren't available to go to 
school, and I had to go to work, which I did. And then

12:53.768 --> 13:02.720
I wanted to go to A&M all the time, but it just didn't 
work out. And I went to work, got a pretty good job.

13:08.006 --> 13:08.887
Then I got married. That postponed it a while. Your 
wife? Came from this area also? Yes, she did. And

13:14.149 --> 13:14.589
her name? Her name was Elizabeth Hughes. And her 
family is one of the old families here in Hunt

13:17.732 --> 13:24.238
County, a big ranch family. And

13:25.859 --> 13:35.127
we have two boys that are 38 and 39 now. One's in 
Corpus, one's in Denison.

13:42.485 --> 13:45.710
But back to my school, after I got... Neither of the 
boys followed the veterinary profession. No,

13:48.274 --> 13:53.141
they said there wasn't enough money in it. Tell us 
about your schooling. Well, I was out of school 13

13:54.804 --> 14:01.654
years when I went back to take English. I'd take 
freshman courses. And the...

14:12.472 --> 14:41.770
courses you know were pretty hard for I was 30 years 
old when I went back to school and

14:12.472 --> 14:41.770
I was one of the first veterans to come back on the 
campus and they thought we just hung the moon that

14:12.472 --> 14:41.770
everything was anything we wanted we could have 
which worked out pretty good they helped find

14:12.472 --> 14:41.770
housing and so forth but

14:43.471 --> 14:46.034
I started in 45 and got out in 49. At that time, it was 
a five-year course. And I had one year of one

14:50.520 --> 14:56.808
trimester. I think my first year was a trimester 
when A&M was on trimester. And so I finished in 49,

15:02.995 --> 15:13.208
finally got my degree, came back to Greenville to 
start practice. When I went to school, when I went

15:14.335 --> 15:21.122
down there, I had enough saved up from my job that 
I'd been working on. I had enough saved to go

15:21.142 --> 15:26.788
through school, which at that time wasn't a whole 
lot of money. The GI Bill helped a little also,

15:27.028 --> 15:29.991
didn't it? Yeah, the GI Bill, which helped a lot. 
Yeah, it sure did. And then I came back to

15:34.395 --> 15:40.041
Greenville to practice. Was your dad still in 
practice from the time you began? Yes. Yes, he was

15:44.643 --> 15:46.885
still in practice. Well, that helped a whole lot, 
didn't it? Oh, yeah. He had a practice waiting for

15:48.927 --> 15:55.472
me, which was

15:48.927 --> 15:55.472
fine. It just meant a whole lot to me to be able to 
step in. He enjoyed a good reputation among his

16:01.658 --> 16:06.101
colleagues. At the time you first went in 
practice, emergency practice was still pretty

16:07.202 --> 16:13.688
much done. so-called fire engine, run out and 
treat cases in the middle of the night. What was

16:20.615 --> 16:26.081
your earliest recollection of practices you 
started in the early 50s? Well, in the early 50s,

16:26.562 --> 16:33.590
every call I got was an emergency because I was 
broke and I was hungry. And it didn't bother me to go

16:34.992 --> 16:43.843
at 2 o'clock, 3 o'clock in the morning any more than 
it did during the day because I needed to practice.

16:45.072 --> 16:53.803
And

16:45.072 --> 16:53.803
so lots of times, I'd be out on a case maybe all night 
or most of the night. And I'm sure like you did, it

16:55.084 --> 16:59.850
was just a case of go when they called. But the 
farther along you get, the more you realize that

17:01.012 --> 17:09.562
everything's not an emergency.

17:09.583 --> 17:14.809
When among the, you observed your father practice 
quite a bit. some tremendous advances. In fact, I

17:18.033 --> 17:27.167
think the greatest advances have taken place in 
medicine actually is what we did from the 1920s

17:18.033 --> 17:27.167
till now. What are some of the landmarks that you 
remember comparing the practice of the 20s to what

17:28.108 --> 17:37.181
we have today? Oh, I think the greatest one is 
anesthesia. Tell us the evolution of that as you

17:42.168 --> 17:44.712
saw it. Well, I remember when I was real small, we 
did a lot of surgery without anesthesia at all. We

17:52.707 --> 17:56.090
did tree fines on horses. We did spays. And I was 
just big enough to help hold. And the first

18:03.197 --> 18:13.146
anesthesia that I recall him using was when we got 
Nembutal capsules.

18:14.560 --> 18:21.109
I know they'd break up the capsules into a little 
vial with, I don't know whether the water was even

18:14.560 --> 18:21.109
sterile or not. I think it was boiled water. I'm 
sure it was. And draw it into the syringe and give it

18:24.934 --> 18:30.041
intraperitoneally.

18:33.947 --> 18:39.895
So

18:33.947 --> 18:39.895
it worked. It was a lot better than it had before. 
Although the popularity of such things as

18:44.227 --> 18:55.882
sulfathiazole, sulfanilamide, and so forth was 
short-lived, it really had a place where we had it,

18:44.227 --> 18:55.882
didn't it? Well, of course, this was, yeah, sulfas 
were fine when they did come in. But that was back in

19:02.170 --> 19:06.255
the 40s, wasn't it? Yes. Yes, that was in the early 
40s when the sulfanilamides came. And... I

19:15.310 --> 19:24.068
don't know how we got along without them.

19:24.088 --> 19:34.770
But you know, they say that we were told that 85% of 
them would get well if you didn't do anything to

19:24.088 --> 19:34.770
them, so I guess we were banking on the 85%.

19:38.480 --> 19:47.290
Well, later on practice changed a little bit, and 
things went into more herd management bases,

19:38.480 --> 19:47.290
isn't that right? Oh yeah, the herd management 
programs were, they started in about, I guess in

19:47.310 --> 19:56.159
the 50s.

19:59.523 --> 20:02.106
I recall that. And, well, your clients were a 
better educated group of people they were taking

20:08.332 --> 20:38.271
ag courses even though it was in high school they 
were getting some ag courses and then a lot of your a

20:08.332 --> 20:38.271
lot of your clients would were college graduates 
and they respected the veterinary medicine so it

20:08.332 --> 20:38.271
it made it made a lot of difference as far as as far as 
the relationship between the client and

20:40.276 --> 20:45.764
veterinarian. In small animal practice as things 
came along what do you think are the most

20:45.784 --> 21:00.806
significant advances we've made in the last 30 
years from a small animal practice in a relatively

20:45.784 --> 21:00.806
small town? Well there again I think the I think the 
anesthesia is one of the finest things because

21:02.728 --> 21:09.338
when I was in school In the 40s, all of our 
anesthesia was, in small animal, was IV. We had no

21:18.133 --> 21:20.315
gas machines that we used. And, of course, we all 
know the value of gas as far as the mortality rate is

21:21.876 --> 21:31.985
concerned. And, of course, the procedures. I 
remember in surgery, when I was in vet school, When

21:40.182 --> 21:45.107
we'd do a spay, our sutures were just through and 
through. In fact, yours was the same way under Dr.

21:45.147 --> 21:49.832
Armstead, wasn't it? No. Well, of course, I went to 
Iowa State. Oh, you didn't go. Well, I went to

21:52.695 --> 22:02.385
school, but after we, when I precepted, 
everything was individually sutured, adenium

21:52.695 --> 22:02.385
and muscle, fascia and skin. Well, that changed 
when Dr. Lum came to A&M. Do you know? Yes. Yes. He

22:09.359 --> 22:16.270
came out, and I forget that Dr. Lum said, we won't do 
that anymore. We were just putting our through and

22:17.151 --> 22:23.742
through, skin, peritoneum, muscle, peritoneum, 
and everything. Hey. Now Annie wants to talk to

22:24.403 --> 22:27.988
you. We were discussing anesthesias in small 
animal practice. What else has changed in small

22:32.596 --> 22:35.400
animals since... you first went and practiced it. 
In the first place, the volume of practice

22:38.094 --> 22:40.938
increased a little bit, hasn't it? The volume has 
increased. The use of fluids has improved

22:42.781 --> 22:46.888
tremendously. In

22:48.170 --> 22:59.930
fact, early, the use of fluids was just a last 
resort, more or less. But now we're using them.

23:03.865 --> 23:09.494
right at the beginning, like they do with medical 
patients, MDs. And, of course,

23:10.816 --> 23:21.071
the vaccines have improved so much. The different 
types of vaccines, we have so many different

23:21.091 --> 23:28.843
vaccines now, but when I started, The only thing we 
used was a two-way black leg or a three-way black

23:30.764 --> 23:44.185
leg for

23:30.764 --> 23:44.185
vaccination caves.

23:47.149 --> 23:55.422
And now we have any number of

23:47.149 --> 23:55.422
vaccines that We've gotten a tremendous number of 
viral diseases we're vaccinating against in the

23:56.414 --> 24:06.606
various animals, large animals especially. You 
went around, do you recognize any of these things

24:08.087 --> 24:13.293
like IBR and all those things? Were they here 
before or did we just miss them? I don't believe so.

24:20.762 --> 24:21.903
I don't believe they were here. I think they kind of 
came in like the AIDS did. I think a lot of our viral

24:27.498 --> 24:34.289
diseases have, in my experience, I don't believe 
we had all of those. The same thing with feline

24:34.489 --> 24:43.323
leukemia and with the Parvo virus, etc., etc. You 
felt they're brand new, right? Well, we didn't

24:46.027 --> 24:52.397
know anything about Parvo when I finished school 
or when I first started practicing. In fact, it

24:52.417 --> 24:54.400
came along, what, in the Of course, we did have some 
acute dysentery, but they looked different.

24:59.245 --> 24:59.565
Yeah. And a lot of those acute dysentery were from 
hookworm. Yes, sir. Sure were. Well, real fine.

25:12.405 --> 25:22.260
You've been considerably involved for a fair 
amount of time in the examining board and the

25:12.405 --> 25:22.260
practice act, and you know there's always a some 
perhaps room for controversy, as to how much they

25:22.865 --> 25:29.932
protect the public. And of course, us 
veterinarians who see the inside of it think it's

25:30.773 --> 25:35.697
very important. What's your balanced opinion of 
how the Practice Act is working for what it's

25:36.618 --> 25:44.005
supposed to do to protect the public? Well, I think 
it's a tool that we need, and I think it's a tool that

25:52.987 --> 25:59.152
I don't think we could do without it because of the 
quackery and so forth that goes on. If it goes

25:59.833 --> 26:07.640
uncontrolled, and that's the purpose of the 
Practice Act, is to protect the public. And if you

26:07.660 --> 26:13.385
have no control over it, it could be disastrous. 
And we've had, I know in serving 12 years on the

26:14.926 --> 26:21.812
examining board,

26:24.661 --> 26:32.191
We saw many, many cases of malpractice that should 
have never been by veterinarians. So you not only

26:33.132 --> 26:41.743
protect them from the quacks, you protect the 
public from the veterinarians, some of them that

26:33.132 --> 26:41.743
are out of line. And to the drug problem among 
veterinarians is raised its ugly head, and we've

26:48.286 --> 26:55.495
had a lot of that in drug abuse in our own 
profession.

27:05.688 --> 27:16.581
The fact that the Federal Trade Commission has 
gotten into the act somehow or other, it was a bit of

27:05.688 --> 27:16.581
a surprise to us, wasn't it? In what respect? They 
don't want anything which would restrain free

27:18.796 --> 27:26.083
trade and advertising and all that sort of thing. 
We try to maintain the profession on a

27:26.203 --> 27:32.829
professional basis, and there seems to be a little 
confliction there. Well, I think a whole lot of

27:34.250 --> 27:47.622
that was resolved in Arizona versus Bates in the 
advertising, and the Trade Commission got into

27:34.250 --> 27:47.622
that, and they can now advertise like they want. 
which is, I don't know whether it's good or bad.

27:54.947 --> 27:58.552
Being from the old school, I never did condone 
advertising. I thought it wasn't professional.

28:02.799 --> 28:08.868
But evidently I'm wrong because a lot of them are 
doing it, and I can't see that the world's any worse

28:02.799 --> 28:08.868
off. One of the other things that I've more or less 
felt that, people like you who had your dad in

28:17.386 --> 28:26.675
practice and you've been on the board and you can 
just look at practice from all its facets.

28:30.199 --> 28:45.975
There's some feeling that we're kind of losing 
grip as a profession and professional bearing and

28:30.199 --> 28:45.975
it's getting on toward more of a technology and a 
technician type of thing and that you don't need

28:30.199 --> 28:45.975
the rapport with the client and the patient and so 
forth the way you used to have. And if you just do

28:51.341 --> 28:56.307
these things and do these tests, it'll all get 
done. I'm sure you've had observations on that as

28:58.129 --> 29:01.414
the years go on. Well, I don't know. I think the 
farther along we get in practicing veterinary

29:06.881 --> 29:13.549
medicine,

29:16.162 --> 29:21.650
I believe a lot of dedication has gone out the 
window.

29:21.670 --> 29:30.404
I know that

29:21.670 --> 29:30.404
going back to my father's practice, I've been with 
him many times. We'd drive up to a place. This was

29:32.867 --> 29:34.169
during the Depression. He'd tell me, he said, 
well, son, we're not going to get paid anything for

29:34.209 --> 29:37.654
this. But he'd do the job anyway.

29:43.347 --> 29:44.709
He got paid for some of it. Some of it we got 
chickens, some of it different things,

29:44.729 --> 29:49.216
vegetables and whatever. But

29:49.316 --> 29:56.306
he was doing it for a living. Don't misunderstand 
me that. But I never knew how he turned down a call to

30:00.012 --> 30:07.684
someone that had an animal that was sick. And I 
tried to do that myself.

30:15.764 --> 30:26.994
The pride in a difficult job well done

30:15.764 --> 30:26.994
meant a lot to you, didn't it? Yes, it sure did, sure 
did.

31:32.545 --> 31:37.173
I guess we've brought that on ourselves, though, 
you know. The doctors have been smart enough to

31:38.576 --> 31:43.204
say, well, now look here, we're not sure about 
this. We're going to have to send some of this into

31:43.244 --> 31:45.307
the laboratory. We're going to have to do this and 
that and the other. But we thought we had to give a

31:47.151 --> 31:55.465
diagnosis right across the table, you know.
