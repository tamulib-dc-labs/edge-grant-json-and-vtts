WEBVTT

00:12.451 --> 00:32.694
Well, when I entered the Army, as I just mentioned, 
I think we probably had the initial edge, A&M

00:12.451 --> 00:32.694
officers did, over the West Point officers, 
military academy graduates, initially, in terms

00:12.451 --> 00:32.694
of branch knowledge. And I think that's the only 
advantage we had, basically, over them, because

00:34.856 --> 00:41.884
their education while it was branched in 
material, was still oriented

00:42.590 --> 00:56.964
very much toward the military profession, 
military history,

00:42.590 --> 00:56.964
customs of the service. And of course, they were 
immaculate in formations.

01:03.871 --> 01:11.618
And they excelled us in every way, I would say, in 
military precision formation.

01:12.627 --> 01:26.388
Now, I think that when A&M went to the branch 
immaterial

01:12.627 --> 01:26.388
form of instruction, or body of instruction, then 
that advantage was lost. I wouldn't think

01:28.311 --> 01:41.250
I could detect in the Vietnam era, for example, we 
were still getting the We were getting the

01:42.715 --> 01:52.346
branching material officer then, but I don't 
think that advantage that we had in World War II

01:42.715 --> 01:52.346
time over the West Pointer existed anymore. And 
that was only really in a matter of branch

01:52.366 --> 01:55.910
knowledge. And knowledge, of course, is a very 
important element of leadership. And so it gave

01:59.695 --> 02:02.458
the A&M officer a very good start. It ends up the 
infantry or signal or whatever.

02:12.095 --> 02:17.502
It was then up to him to keep the lead if he could. I 
don't think that in wartime, World War II

02:18.984 --> 02:40.313
experience or Vietnam experience, I never 
really, or during my entire career, I was never

02:18.984 --> 02:40.313
conscious of the West Point versus other source 
officer controversy that you'd often seen

02:18.984 --> 02:40.313
discussed. Now, in wartime, there's no question 
the Vietnam War was different, but in World War II,

02:42.065 --> 02:55.801
we needed every man that could bear arms. We 
needed, with that tremendously rapid expansion

02:58.284 --> 03:09.557
of our armed forces, we needed everyone who could 
possibly command successfully at all levels. And

03:10.263 --> 03:19.837
all of a sudden, this little army of 200,000, less 
than 200,000, became 14 million. And we should

03:19.858 --> 03:31.515
never under-evaluate

03:19.858 --> 03:31.515
the importance of those professional officers in 
creating that huge army soundly and effectively.

03:33.118 --> 03:37.384
Although those units were filled with people like 
me who came in from reserve status, National Guard

03:39.203 --> 03:43.868
status, or commissioned in the course of the war 
status.

03:47.733 --> 03:58.866
I never felt that I was at a disadvantage in 
competing for jobs or promotions in the Army with

03:47.733 --> 03:58.866
West Pointers. If you can use that term, 
competing, I guess we're subconsciously or

03:59.587 --> 04:05.533
unconsciously competing. Everybody's 
competing. Yeah. directly conscious of it.

04:12.102 --> 04:24.246
So I think that much of that West Point 
controversy, which I used to hear a lot of in my

04:12.102 --> 04:24.246
younger, you know, my earlier years before World 
War II pretty much erased it. I think that's a

04:25.268 --> 04:27.452
result more of a earlier times. Must have been. I'm 
not familiar with those earlier details, but it's

04:31.649 --> 04:36.575
not significant now. But I think it's a fair 
question to ask how we compare it, because A&M is

04:36.715 --> 04:47.749
producing officers to go into the Army and the 
other services, and it's fair to know how they

04:36.715 --> 04:47.749
stack up. And certainly the professional

04:48.330 --> 04:55.178
military academies is a good point of comparison. 
But you never felt that you were at a disadvantage

04:55.647 --> 05:03.055
in promotion throughout your entire career 
because you had not attended West Point? Never

05:03.635 --> 05:04.056
did.

05:11.624 --> 05:24.237
You know, there are two things about

05:11.624 --> 05:24.237
military service that particularly people

05:11.624 --> 05:24.237
who've been involved extensively in wars in the 
Army at least, tend to settle on. One is an outlook

05:30.784 --> 05:37.655
that fate is going to determine whether you live or 
die. Most soldiers arrive at that after they've

05:39.518 --> 05:43.945
been in war sometime. It may not be right, but they 
do. What do you think? And the other one is being at

05:47.698 --> 05:56.410
the right place at the right time makes an awful lot 
of difference in how you progress. And that's

05:57.492 --> 05:59.434
true. Of course, the fact is that if you're in the 
right place at the right time, you still have to

05:59.454 --> 06:05.222
produce to progress. You say, how do I feel about 
faith? What are your opinions on those two issues?

06:11.591 --> 06:12.572
I agree with both of those. I became a believer in 
faith. I think it's as much, not that I was always in

06:17.407 --> 06:31.286
such frequent, or any soldier for that matter, so 
frequent and constant jeopardy, but I tell you, I

06:17.407 --> 06:31.286
was not an infantryman. I have all the respect in 
the world for the infantry, and I was brought up in

06:31.566 --> 06:47.228
the Army, convinced, oriented to the fact that the 
battle is going to be won finally by the infantry.

06:49.807 --> 07:10.028
Everybody else from the direct support field 
artillery where I was most of the time in World War

06:49.807 --> 07:10.028
II,

06:49.807 --> 07:10.028
all the way back to the guy shipping bullets, is 
working for the infantry in support of the

06:49.807 --> 07:10.028
infantry. But those are the guys that, while 
battle is never constant, when they are in battle,

07:19.658 --> 07:26.444
I can understand how they do become fatalists 
because it's one way to throw off the concern about

07:19.658 --> 07:26.444
it. You're bound to be concerned about it, being 
under fire so frequently and so intensively as

07:27.045 --> 07:35.953
most of them are in an active battle. Well, what 
about that idea of being at the right place at the

07:36.634 --> 07:41.358
right time? Is that more important for a promotion 
in the military or is it more important that you do

07:41.419 --> 07:48.265
the job right? In other words, do you determine 
your promotions, or just that fate, that ideal

07:49.156 --> 07:53.200
fate? No, fate has something to do with that, too, I 
guess, the roll of the dice. But it's not that

07:59.187 --> 08:00.208
simple.

08:04.293 --> 08:10.219
You will be in the right place at the right time 
because somebody initially thought that's where

08:04.293 --> 08:10.219
you ought to be. Whether it's a fellow reading your 
records or whether it's the general up here who

08:15.228 --> 08:25.004
knows you and has served with you before, and he 
knows you, and he doesn't know the other

08:15.228 --> 08:25.004
candidates, so he wants you.

08:29.231 --> 08:40.189
But however you got there, the fact that you have 
been in the right place at the right time to meet a

08:29.231 --> 08:40.189
test and did it, there's no question that It has an 
influence on how you succeed, not only rank-wise,

08:41.384 --> 08:53.154
but in building your base of knowledge and 
experience and expertise.

08:55.596 --> 09:03.503
I know I had a few classmates that I can recall, A&M 
classmates, that came out of World War II as

08:55.596 --> 09:03.503
captains.

09:06.785 --> 09:10.969
I came out as a lieutenant colonel, and that wasn't 
unusual. And

09:11.675 --> 09:19.728
some of those captains I knew pretty well from A&M 
days. And they were victims of circumstance. You

09:26.558 --> 09:32.588
know, being in the wrong place at the wrong time or 
not getting to the right place at the right time

09:26.558 --> 09:32.588
because they can't do it better than that. You see 
some examples of that. I always felt that where

09:34.591 --> 09:38.998
World War II and Vietnam experience, too, was 
concerned, that I was in a position to be a

09:40.666 --> 09:43.849
profiteer of circumstance. I couldn't have been 
in a better situation in wartime to have the

09:43.929 --> 10:07.931
opportunity to contribute and test yourself, be 
tested, and gain from success the satisfaction of

09:43.929 --> 10:07.931
knowing you're contributing something. You're 
doing something right. Good. Effective. So we're

10:14.176 --> 10:20.165
oversimplified by those two things, fate and 
being in the right place at the right time. But

10:21.507 --> 10:23.330
there's something to it. I think this believing in 
fate simply is a matter of covering the concerns.

10:29.259 --> 10:30.080
Of possible death. Of possible death. And you get 
to where you think in terms of your friends that

10:33.565 --> 10:38.112
way, your comrades.

10:40.606 --> 10:56.089
Any commander worth his salt is concerned about 
not overexposing his troops and not putting them

10:40.606 --> 10:56.089
in an unacceptable

10:40.606 --> 10:56.089
danger. But he comes to think pretty much in terms 
of faith for them, too, I think. I've seen...

11:09.142 --> 11:20.297
As I said earlier, religion has been important to 
me, but I've seen deeply religious people that can

11:09.142 --> 11:20.297
put that more in terms of the Lord taking care of 
them more directly. What is faith? That's part of

11:23.140 --> 11:23.741
it. Let's turn to your academic career. Tell me 
about it. When you went down there, did you have

11:30.149 --> 11:32.412
firm ideas? Did you want to go into business, or did 
you have any idea? Did you know what you wanted to do

11:35.136 --> 11:37.579
academically? Yes, I wanted to be a banker for some 
reason. I'm not sure what. I wanted to get into

11:44.448 --> 11:49.776
banking.

11:50.757 --> 11:59.309
So looking at A&M at that time, we didn't have a 
business major like we do now. The nearest thing to

11:59.330 --> 12:05.378
it was agricultural administration with a major 
in marketing and finance. And so that was my major.

12:09.773 --> 12:13.378
I could never get the country out of me entirely. My 
minor was animal husbandry. In fact, I think my

12:17.244 --> 12:20.529
father always really expected me to come back 
here.

12:23.694 --> 12:25.516
When you didn't, do you think that he was let down? 
Beg your pardon? When you did not return and stayed

12:28.080 --> 12:32.707
in the military, do you think he was let down? I 
don't think so. I think he might have been

12:35.211 --> 12:36.853
disappointed. And I think the reason he thought I 
would come back was because Of all the boys, I

12:39.929 --> 12:47.777
seemed to be the one that, I guess, showed perhaps 
more attachment to the land. Maybe that was just a

12:47.837 --> 12:50.339
matter of demonstration rather than feeling.

12:52.882 --> 13:07.136
And George, who it turned out was the one who did 
come back and stay, eventually come back,

12:52.882 --> 13:07.136
Dad thought would not want to be here, I think. He 
never told me that. But George, when he graduated

13:09.258 --> 13:19.494
from A&M, got into the production credit 
organization and did very well and had good jobs.

13:21.357 --> 13:26.085
And eventually was sent back to Kauffman, took 
that office. And then when Dad died suddenly, he

13:27.447 --> 13:34.118
came to, of course, take over the place, which was a 
natural thing to do. Incidentally, I mentioned my

13:35.380 --> 13:38.584
dad dying by accidental death.

13:43.850 --> 13:50.097
He had a 55 gallon oil drum rigged up to put air 
pressure on it and spray his cattle. I just

13:52.500 --> 14:01.590
happened to be home en route to the ROTC camp when I 
was on the staff at A&M. and went to town with him and

14:03.359 --> 14:31.020
he took that tank in and his pickup to get it aired up 
while I got a haircut and the boys at the station

14:03.359 --> 14:31.020
were busy and he aired that thing up himself and his 
uh obviously the lid had been weakened or

14:03.359 --> 14:31.020
something anyway the lid just blew off and that 
intake pipe struck him in the head and killed his uh

14:33.025 --> 14:37.570
So, he lived a matter of a couple of hours, but never 
knew anything after that. So, I just thought I'd

14:37.590 --> 14:39.331
explain that. That must have had a big impact on 
you. How old were you? Twenty? No, I was back from

14:45.057 --> 14:48.180
World War II then, and I was forty-eight. I was not 
yet married, but I was, let's see, I would have been

14:48.341 --> 15:02.475
twenty-nine.

15:03.147 --> 15:06.590
Well, you know, you can usually see a silver lining 
to every cloud. The

15:06.630 --> 15:16.039
one we saw was that Dad would have been the world's 
worst invalid. And so you can immediately

15:16.059 --> 15:19.021
appreciate that he was not just crippled. And then 
if you accept that, you can appreciate that he

15:20.042 --> 15:31.973
didn't live into

15:20.042 --> 15:31.973
old age that incapacitated him. Why do you say he'd 
be the world's worst cripple? Because he was such

15:35.640 --> 15:39.243
an energetic, physical man. Active man. Active 
man. At the age of 69, he never would admit that he'd

15:41.125 --> 15:55.037
lost any of his powers, you know, physical powers, 
or mental. Now, at A&M, what classes, what type of

15:55.057 --> 16:00.542
coursework did you like?

16:05.973 --> 16:22.749
Well, having chosen that course, majoring in 
marketing and finance,

16:05.973 --> 16:22.749
this, of course, starts basically with economics 
and then gets into, as the term describes. So I

16:24.831 --> 16:32.098
guess I enjoyed all of those courses. We had to have 
so much history and so much English. And English

16:36.804 --> 16:38.226
never bothered me. That was a great problem with a 
lot of my counterparts or comrades from small

16:38.266 --> 16:45.295
schools. We were fortunate. Had to have so much 
math. Math was never my long suit. But I liked the

16:51.923 --> 16:53.745
economics and the finance. I kind of enjoyed 
accounting. That was almost a minor by virtue of

16:59.032 --> 17:02.136
the course, you know. Were there professors there 
that- But I particularly also, I never minded

17:03.297 --> 17:18.731
these required courses off-subject because they 
were all, I liked history, for example.

17:20.833 --> 17:24.757
I wish I'd been a better student of it because it 
later became important to me. Sure. Were there

17:25.657 --> 17:30.722
professors there that were important to you or 
that you had a closer relationship with?

17:32.980 --> 17:34.782
Not really, and I'll tell you why. We all had our 
favorite professors, and we all had those that we

17:37.125 --> 17:41.992
liked. Very few, I can't think of one that I really 
disliked.

17:51.504 --> 17:54.548
But there was a distance between students and 
professors then. As a matter of fact, you could

17:54.709 --> 18:01.958
still detect in the classrooms that the 
professors still felt some responsibility for

18:02.545 --> 18:11.238
that matter discipline, which related to the 
military aspects of that university. I'm sure

18:11.258 --> 18:13.401
that was a carryover from the early years. 
Probably when they were very small, every

18:14.483 --> 18:20.512
professor had a role in the military training. I 
don't know that to be a fact, but I often suspected

18:21.694 --> 18:24.257
that. And I never had any special problems. I did 
become quite close to... You know, I'm

18:32.043 --> 18:33.805
embarrassed I can't call his name. He was an animal 
husbandry professor, and he winds up getting me in

18:33.885 --> 18:43.974
trouble because he talked me into taking advanced 
statistics course. Buenas tardes. Come on. Si,

18:50.620 --> 18:51.641
okay. Yo no se donde esta.

18:56.886 --> 19:00.970
We're talking about an academic career at A&M. Do 
you think that the career that you had, the

19:02.631 --> 19:08.340
academic career that you had, prepared you for 
banking? Yeah, sure do. I was really looking

19:10.583 --> 19:15.150
forward until it became obvious that we were going 
to the Army. I was looking forward to getting to

19:15.170 --> 19:17.674
that bank and learning all about it. Okay, now you 
told me that you had a job lined up. Yes, sir. Will

19:20.658 --> 19:21.379
you relate that? I had a dean, Kyle, who was dean of 
the School of Agriculture, my dean, really did

19:30.650 --> 19:32.512
this. I applied properly and all that, but I think 
his influence got me a job with the Federal Land

19:32.752 --> 19:38.097
Bank in Houston. And he took me down there to meet 
the top people, and the president told me that his

19:39.438 --> 19:50.229
plan was to move me from department to department. 
And as I absorbed that, I'd make the full circle,

19:50.349 --> 19:54.633
and then they'd decide what to do with me. But I 
thought that was a wonderful opportunity. But of

19:57.135 --> 20:00.218
course, it was becoming more and more obvious, and 
we were ordered to active duty upon graduation,

20:01.295 --> 20:04.799
knew it was going to happen before we ever 
graduated. All these jobs, everybody, generally

20:04.859 --> 20:11.246
speaking, had a job lined up early in the second 
semester.

20:13.809 --> 20:18.154
So, anyway, I thought my course was very 
appropriate for what I was setting out to do. By May

20:18.674 --> 20:23.920
of 1941, then, you had prepared yourself to go into 
the military. You bet. I've got to tell you a little

20:24.881 --> 20:29.867
story that I think is very American and also is... 
somewhat descriptive of the way we were thinking

20:30.843 --> 20:37.291
in that last semester of my senior year. And every 
outfit, you know, these little military outfits

20:38.813 --> 20:49.987
that we live in, we all, members of our class, 
become very close and extremely close by the time

20:38.813 --> 20:49.987
you reach your senior year, because it's been a 
lost process. Two

20:50.067 --> 20:59.078
fine fellows in C battery in my class were adapted 
Americans. Ty Kovach, Japanese, full-blooded

21:03.041 --> 21:06.607
Japanese. He was born in this country. His parents 
were not. And Peter Kousoulis, Pedro Kousoulis,

21:09.791 --> 21:26.095
from Laredo, whose father was a Greek immigrant 
who married a Spanish lady, Mexican lady, at the

21:09.791 --> 21:26.095
border. And Pete, boy, they're wonderful guys. 
Pete talked with a Greek-Mexican accent, if you

21:30.904 --> 21:35.311
can imagine that.

21:40.178 --> 21:55.963
At this time, of course, in our last semester, we 
were devoting most of our bullet session time to

21:40.178 --> 21:55.963
the possibilities of getting into this war, World 
War II, and to the events of the day that outrageous

21:40.178 --> 21:55.963
related to the war. This particular night we were 
in my room and mine and Anderson's room and

21:56.872 --> 22:25.866
reviewing the news of the day and the 
German-American boon led by Fritz Kuhn, you were

21:56.872 --> 22:25.866
too young to attach to that I guess, but he had just 
displayed very arrogant and we thought misguided

21:56.872 --> 22:25.866
energies up in New York I believe it was to organize 
a Nazi... support organization in the United

22:27.027 --> 22:30.391
States, and of course this just incensed us. And 
I'll never forget, Peter Kasulis was ordinarily a

22:31.592 --> 22:49.853
very quiet fella, but when he got stirred up, he did 
get stirred up, and he listened and finally joined

22:31.592 --> 22:49.853
into this conversation about the 
German-American boon with one very brief but

22:31.592 --> 22:49.853
strong statement. He beat the desk and he says, the 
trouble with this country, there's too many

22:49.873 --> 22:54.638
foreign pimples in it. Which I think is a splendid 
testimony of the immigrant American. He's just as

23:03.062 --> 23:05.305
American as anybody. Of course, he was born in this 
country. But that very near attachment to foreign

23:07.208 --> 23:11.453
land meant nothing to him. He was just as involved 
as we were. Sure. How about your Japanese friend?

23:19.643 --> 23:20.484
Oh, he was the same. He was the same, and a fine man. 
His father was a His father was a truck farmer down

23:27.524 --> 23:36.598
near Houston, and Ty succeeded him in that and is 
still there. Ty lost his wife recently. I called

23:38.641 --> 23:41.565
him when I learned about it. An interesting thing, 
I went to war against the Japanese. There was a

23:47.755 --> 23:55.827
great deal of sentiment, as you know, about the 
Japanese problem in this country. And Ty and I were

23:57.005 --> 24:04.234
very good friends, but he just would never 
initiate a communication to me. And the only

24:06.217 --> 24:18.452
reason I could, when I was over there, and the only 
reason I could, I never asked him, was he didn't

24:06.217 --> 24:18.452
want to prejudice me in any way by putting that Ty 
Kovacs on his letter. You know, everything going

24:18.633 --> 24:23.098
in and coming out.

24:23.118 --> 24:24.480
That just may be a... What happened to him during 
the war? The reason to reinforce that thought, the

24:29.379 --> 24:36.328
week after the war was over, I got a letter from him. 
He, in the late stages of the war, was drafted. Not

24:40.734 --> 24:41.214
early. He didn't have a commission. Did he 
graduate? He graduated. Why didn't he have a

24:45.720 --> 24:48.484
commission? He was not selected for the advanced 
course. You see, in those days, Everyone was in the

24:53.603 --> 24:59.291
cadet corps except graduate students and 
crippled. And even though there were only a

24:59.311 --> 25:08.723
certain number of contracts that were made with 
the juniors to pursue advanced military science

24:59.311 --> 25:08.723
after their first two years. And there were quite a 
number that weren't selected. Incidentally, we

25:15.533 --> 25:19.658
got paid a little bit for that too, you know. But if 
you weren't, you still stayed in your military

25:19.678 --> 25:22.342
outfit. You still had your Class privileges. You 
still had your seniority within the

25:25.716 --> 25:29.360
organization. And so after the first two years, he 
was not selected. That's right. But he was drafted

25:33.425 --> 25:35.247
during the Second World War? Yes. He was not given a 
commission? No. He was drafted. I forget now just

25:39.751 --> 25:43.456
what the timing was, but it was late in the war. I 
think in the early part of the war, I don't know that

25:44.677 --> 25:50.884
the Japanese presidents had anything to do with 
it. I rather think that he was necessary to

25:50.904 --> 25:53.867
agriculture, you know, Anybody producing like 
they produced were significant in the picture. I

26:00.257 --> 26:03.021
mean, this is food for Houston industrial 
workers. Did he go to the European theater?

26:09.009 --> 26:15.699
I don't—I think he was sent to the Pacific after the 
war actually was over. You know, after the

26:15.719 --> 26:16.760
surrender. Sure. Okay. As I recall. It's been so 
long I just don't piece it all together. Now, a lot

26:23.429 --> 26:30.819
of people say that A&M is more than an institution 
of higher learning, but it's something special.

26:31.299 --> 26:32.321
What are your thoughts on that? Well, I agree with 
that, at least that I know it.

26:39.630 --> 26:49.723
First of all,

26:39.630 --> 26:49.723
we got that sense of oneness And the A&M spirit that 
stuck with us, and I think that's a plus. But also, I

26:55.383 --> 26:58.327
think that Cadet Corps always thought so. Whether 
you went in the military or not initially put you

26:58.847 --> 27:05.195
ahead of your contemporaries. Whether you're 
going into an engineering job, now my class didn't

27:05.215 --> 27:11.222
get to do that.

27:11.641 --> 27:18.089
I think the best example, of course, I can think of 
are those just ahead of me, the two or three classes

27:11.641 --> 27:18.089
ahead of me. You always remember the classmen 
ahead of you better than the ones behind you

27:19.050 --> 27:26.079
because you were looking up to them. And the reason 
it did was because that experience they got in that

27:26.099 --> 27:39.977
cadet corps put them ahead relatively in the same 
fashion I've described to you that put us ahead of

27:26.099 --> 27:39.977
the West Point graduate, except in the sense that 
It was the leadership aspect more, in that case,

27:40.126 --> 27:48.275
than the knowledge aspect. You were just bound, if 
you came out of A&M as having been a cadet officer,

27:48.295 --> 28:00.348
and having commanded a company or higher unit, you 
just had to have accumulated some leadership and

27:48.295 --> 28:00.348
management experiences in there. I don't think 
they're separate terms. I think leadership's

28:04.033 --> 28:05.134
enough. That the guy in the ordinary, education 
institution didn't get. That's why I say yes.

28:19.889 --> 28:23.193
What way do you think going to Ann now changed your 
life?

28:28.920 --> 28:31.203
I'm not sure that I can say it changed my life. I 
think it opened up my future to a much... more

28:39.037 --> 28:44.602
advantageous future than I could have ever had 
otherwise. So it gave you new advantages. You bet.

28:47.264 --> 28:48.305
New opportunities. You bet. But as far as changing 
my life, it didn't change any of my basics. It

28:53.209 --> 28:54.210
didn't change... I don't think it changed any of my 
standards.

29:02.737 --> 29:03.998
But it gave me new opportunities.

29:06.921 --> 29:07.021
Okay. Let's move on to your military career, then. 
Tell me how you received your commission, and

29:09.125 --> 29:16.234
let's start right in on your first duty station.

29:25.144 --> 29:31.532
Before the first semester of my senior year, I was 
invited to apply for a regular Army commission.

29:32.353 --> 29:35.537
You know, ordinarily we're commissioned as 
lieutenants of the reserve. I got the actual forms

29:37.930 --> 29:48.862
when I was at home Christmas holidays to apply for a 
regular Army commission. And I studied that,

29:50.804 --> 29:58.112
thought about it, and I went to my dad and I said, 
Dad, I don't want a military career. I don't know

29:58.192 --> 29:59.093
why I should. I've never given any consideration 
to a military career. I said, I've enjoyed being in

30:02.016 --> 30:06.621
this cadet corps, but that's not my goal. I said, I 
think I'll just send this back to them, to the Army.

30:13.574 --> 30:16.117
This came out of Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio. 
And, of course, fathers are supposed to give good

30:18.740 --> 30:23.646
advice to their youngsters. And he said, well, I 
tell you, maybe that's the way that you shouldn't

30:23.666 --> 30:29.774
choose to accept that. But you don't know what a 
military career would be like, and you don't know

30:31.757 --> 30:36.102
what a banking career would be like. But you could 
go down and talk to Colonel Beasley,

30:40.618 --> 30:48.367
and he could probably enlighten you on this. Why 
don't you do that? So I called Colonel Beasley, and

30:49.709 --> 31:00.942
during my holidays and his, I went down and told him 
what the situation was, and I said, now, I'd just

30:49.709 --> 31:00.942
like you to tell me what I should consider before I 
act on this. Colonel Beasley was a very beloved

31:02.221 --> 31:05.765
instructor of field artillery. He was our senior 
field artillery instructor. And you asked if I'd

31:09.809 --> 31:11.611
been very close. I guess I was as close to him in 
regard as any of them, and also, through those

31:11.751 --> 31:24.724
years, a professional as far as the Corps versus 
military staff was concerned. He gave me a

31:26.747 --> 31:29.089
wonderful

31:31.330 --> 31:59.008
critique of a military career I thought he didn't 
try to talk me into accepting that and he didn't

31:31.330 --> 31:59.008
agree with me that I should let it go

31:31.330 --> 31:59.008
but he says I

31:31.330 --> 31:59.008
may be wrong but he says I believe that we're going 
to get in this war and if we do you're going to find

31:31.330 --> 31:59.008
out what the military is like And if you do, if you 
had this regular commission and you like what you

32:01.722 --> 32:10.033
found, then you're set. But if we do go to this war 
and when it's over, you don't have regular

32:12.135 --> 32:23.450
commission but would like to have had it, you'll 
regret having sent this back. So I decided to take

32:23.470 --> 32:27.255
it, and I got it. I decided to apply, and I was given 
it. So I was commissioned a second lieutenant in

32:29.768 --> 32:52.183
the reserves for just a matter of weeks until the 
West Point class graduated, and I was

32:29.768 --> 32:52.183
commissioned in the regular army, second 
lieutenant field artillery, with standing just

32:29.768 --> 32:52.183
behind the class of West Point. In other words, I 
was Even though he graduated earlier, they did

32:55.604 --> 32:59.571
that on purpose? Oh, yes. That'd be fair. Those 
guys had given four years of complete time to

33:01.534 --> 33:06.362
preparing for commissioning. So we were 
commissioned behind them. Now, there were five

33:08.906 --> 33:12.892
others in A&M who got regular commissions. Only 
five others? Yeah. All the rest got reserved?

33:16.258 --> 33:21.907
There were a total of six, two of whom were 
commissioned in the Marines and four in the Army.

33:22.248 --> 33:22.388
Mm-hmm. Of those commissioned in the Marines,

33:25.118 --> 33:32.548
both made it a career. Of those commissioned in the 
Army, three of us made it a career. My first

33:39.077 --> 33:43.482
assignment was to the 1st Cavalry Division at Fort 
Bliss, Texas. Did any, just parenthetically, did

33:43.502 --> 33:49.951
any of those others who received regular 
commissions ever make it to general? No, no. They

33:52.735 --> 33:54.417
were fine officers, but No. So your first 
assignment was? I was assigned to the— And this is

34:02.568 --> 34:06.272
in June of 1941? In June of 1941.

34:14.241 --> 34:16.884
I was assigned to the artillery of the 1st Cavalry 
Division. That division was still a horse cavalry

34:16.964 --> 34:22.530
division in 1941.

34:25.531 --> 34:34.242
As

34:25.531 --> 34:34.242
I recall, we had around 8,000 horses.

34:34.642 --> 34:36.765
The artillery was horse two. The battalion in the 
artillery that I joined initially was mounted. It

34:46.356 --> 34:53.445
was a motorized artillery unit, but it left 
shortly thereafter, and I was reassigned. to the

34:54.117 --> 34:58.322
61st Field Artillery Battalion, which was a horse 
unit. And four and a half years later, I was given

34:59.724 --> 35:11.619
command of that division in the Philippines, of 
that battalion, 61st Field Artillery Battalion.

35:11.639 --> 35:14.103
So I stayed with it the whole war. You're talking 
about being in the right place at the right time.

35:17.307 --> 35:19.129
When vacancies occurred, I was there. and I 
consider myself most fortunate to have been there

35:20.223 --> 35:29.316
and to have succeeded to the command of the 
battalion. But anyway, we thought we were going to

35:30.898 --> 35:38.069
fight the war on the Mexican border because who's 
going to send the horse outfit to fight these days?

35:42.255 --> 35:49.926
But in the summer of 43, two years later, pretty 
late, actually in the winter of 43. We had our

35:52.827 --> 36:03.940
horses taken away, and we were made just really, in 
the cavalry division form of organization, we

35:52.827 --> 36:03.940
were really made a light infantry division. We 
never lost our name, but that's what we were. Were

36:08.285 --> 36:11.088
you sorry to see the horses go? Well, under the 
circumstances, emotionally we were. But as a

36:16.180 --> 36:29.453
matter of reason, we were glad that they were gone 
because nobody wanted to tell his grandchild that

36:16.180 --> 36:29.453
he was on the Mexican borders securing El Paso all 
through World War II on a horse.

36:32.956 --> 36:46.069
But I don't believe that I've ever witnessed a more 
emotional day in the Army, even considering some

36:32.956 --> 36:46.069
of the traumatic memorials to casualties. as was 
shown, that's an extreme statement to make, but

36:47.467 --> 37:07.835
it's because when those horses were taken away, 
because there were this mass of old soldiers, the

36:47.467 --> 37:07.835
non-cons particularly, hundreds and hundreds of 
them, who'd been nothing but horse soldiers, and a

36:47.467 --> 37:07.835
horse becomes just like your friend, you know. It 
just becomes like a family member. And when they

37:11.901 --> 37:16.427
led those horses away, you never saw such emotion 
in your life. Very interesting, I thought. These

37:20.430 --> 37:21.672
old servants are crying? You bet. Oh,

37:23.594 --> 37:27.638
it was unbelievable. But anyway, an era had ended, 
too. Sure. And we all were conscious of that. But at

37:35.347 --> 37:38.030
the same time, we were glad that we were getting 
shaped up. Actually, we'd been lined up to go to the

37:38.490 --> 37:41.734
Pacific when this occurred. For those two years, 
then, what was your job at Fort Bliss? And what was

37:46.968 --> 37:49.232
it, training, basically, or can you explain? 
Well, that's the job of every division. If it's not

37:51.896 --> 37:53.379
in combat, it's training. And we had the best 
trained division, I think, that ever went

37:53.419 --> 38:00.130
overseas because, I say that because of the nature 
of that division. Our personnel were kept intact

38:00.811 --> 38:02.514
more. They trained more constantly. We had less, 
we provided less cadremen to other new outfits

38:05.178 --> 38:12.430
than any division in the Army. Mm-hmm. And so we 
were just extremely well-trained and very

38:13.698 --> 38:16.902
realistic. We had a commander, division 
commander, General I.P. Swift. He was a West Point

38:19.645 --> 38:20.746
graduate. He was a splendid training commander. 
He was a good leader. And we couldn't have been in

38:27.274 --> 38:30.778
better conditions when we went overseas. But 
anyway,

38:30.798 --> 38:39.148
I was initially what's called an assistant 
battery executive officer. I did just about

38:40.411 --> 38:46.237
everything those first few months that a battery 
officer would do, except I'd take command. And

38:48.300 --> 38:51.223
then I was given command of a battery.

38:54.286 --> 38:59.192
I'd have to check my doggone record there, but a 
matter of months after I entered. 1942? Yes. What

39:02.255 --> 39:03.096
was the month? It just says 1942. 1942. Is that when 
you were promoted to first lieutenant? No, that

39:10.921 --> 39:13.304
was after I was promoted to first lieutenant. How 
about captain? I was promptly promoted to

39:16.428 --> 39:18.151
captain. Okay, so you were promoted to captain on 
the 2nd of November, 1942. Well, I was given the

39:22.136 --> 39:24.919
battery before I was promoted. And I went overseas 
with the division commanding that battery. Then

39:32.790 --> 39:40.540
after we'd been overseas for a while and before, we 
went over in July of 1943, Before we were actually

39:41.110 --> 39:43.712
committed to combat, we were in Australia. Okay, 
well, let's get back to Texas. All right. What were

39:50.819 --> 39:52.200
the problems of training?

39:55.483 --> 40:06.053
Well, there were no real problems, but it was

39:55.483 --> 40:06.053
real field soldiers. See, we were right there in 
Fort Bliss on the edge of that vast desert. and uh

40:11.587 --> 40:37.729
you go through training cycles if you've taken in a 
number of recruits then you get cycle back sort of

40:11.587 --> 40:37.729
the basic things until they kind of get to where 
they can work and then you cycle through small unit

40:11.587 --> 40:37.729
training and then battalion and regimental 
training and division things where everybody's

40:11.587 --> 40:37.729
out and then you go to uh as we did both summers after 
I joined the division. I missed one of them. We went

40:42.873 --> 40:46.598
to Louisiana Maneuvers with other divisions and 
did mock warfare. Excellent training. So you were

40:49.142 --> 40:50.043
prepared. You bet. Now, were you eager—this is 
July of 43. We'd been in war for a year and a half. You

40:57.775 --> 41:00.579
were still in America, had been training for all 
that time. Were you eager to go to war? You bet, and

41:02.502 --> 41:06.788
that's why we were— the only reason we were glad to 
see those horses go because— Because we were so

41:07.915 --> 41:10.137
attached to them, you know. But that meant you were 
going to war. But that meant we were going to war.

41:14.642 --> 41:21.188
And anybody in wartime that is an average 
American, he wants to be a part of it. He wants to do

41:21.208 --> 41:22.730
his part of it. Did you have a desire to go either to 
the Pacific or Europe on one way or the other? It

41:27.875 --> 41:30.698
doesn't matter, really. As it turned out,

41:31.278 --> 41:36.083
the— the Japanese war was a dirty war the war with 
the Japanese in many respects but I guess we all

41:36.518 --> 42:04.602
adjusted what we're committed to and I at least 
felt that we were in a preferred situation there to

41:36.518 --> 42:04.602
Europe

41:36.518 --> 42:04.602
why well in the first place

41:36.518 --> 42:04.602
we were less susceptible to the Of course, it was a 
war of mobility in Europe, but to the line on line,

42:05.932 --> 42:14.101
you know. We did a great deal of, I think John 
MacArthur did a beautiful job of executing a very

42:14.121 --> 42:24.753
imaginative strategy. So we didn't get bogged 
down anywhere, and we kept leaping great

42:25.714 --> 42:33.843
distances, and we always were winning. We didn't 
have any serious reversals. Our casualties were

42:36.239 --> 42:39.503
many, of course. By and large, they were in the 
infantry and the people directly supporting

42:41.046 --> 42:50.118
them. So, in a sense, we didn't have to put up with 
the terrible artillery that the Germans could

42:50.138 --> 43:05.098
deliver on our troops or the dive bombers. One time 
where we were really, in my division, exposed to

43:05.281 --> 43:25.564
serious air action by the enemy, and that was in 
Lady

43:05.281 --> 43:25.564
when we had only carrier support and that big naval 
battle occurred which crippled most of our

43:05.281 --> 43:25.564
carriers and therefore immobilized our support 
aircraft. But I think more than those things, it's

43:25.584 --> 43:31.330
just that you know what you're doing. You know what 
it's like where you are. and therefore you prefer

43:33.766 --> 43:37.350
that to the unknown. So I guess what I'm saying is 
that we had many disadvantages, but it didn't

43:37.370 --> 43:43.476
bother us. Disadvantages are that, as I say, the 
Japanese were a very, very sticky, difficult,

43:44.557 --> 43:58.290
mean enemy because of his training and commitment 
to the fight to the death.

44:01.614 --> 44:03.115
The tropics are just pretty dirty place with 
mosquitoes and snakes and other insects and other

44:04.192 --> 44:34.148
reptiles

44:04.192 --> 44:34.148
and as I have expressed it for 18 months between 
Australia

44:04.192 --> 44:34.148
and Luzon in the Philippines for 18 months I never 
heard a door slam that means you're living on the

44:04.192 --> 44:34.148
ground or in best in tents and I think our Our fellow 
soldiers in Europe were managing a little better

44:34.718 --> 44:38.883
than that some of the time. On the other hand, 
another big factor, I'd much rather be in the heat

44:41.425 --> 44:49.114
of the tropics than in the severe cold of the winter 
in Europe. That's my personal viewpoint. Tell me

44:53.419 --> 44:56.142
about your movement in July of 43. When you left 
Texas, where'd you go? We left Texas, went to San

44:59.585 --> 45:03.730
Francisco, and embarked for Brisbane, 
Australia. and we went across by individual

45:04.570 --> 45:10.878
transport ship and without incident. Were you in 
convoys exactly? No, there were no convoys. The

45:15.745 --> 45:33.649
theory was, as passed on, was that those 
individual ships were faster than the convoy

45:15.745 --> 45:33.649
escorts, and therefore your chances of, and 
actually faster than submarines, and our Navy was

45:15.745 --> 45:33.649
trying to keep up with where the submarines are, 
but of course they couldn't bear it too well. So

45:33.950 --> 45:36.173
there's a certain amount of luck in it, I guess. But 
also one ship's harder to spot than a whole bunch.

45:43.061 --> 45:45.784
And we arrived in Australia, of course, in July in 
Australia. It was wintertime. It was pretty cold

45:46.505 --> 45:47.626
when we got there. And we were there five months. 
Really? Mainly. Five months? Five months. And we

45:53.914 --> 45:55.055
got very impatient. I bet. And the reason was 
that...

46:01.996 --> 46:18.240
As best we could figure out, and I guess I should 
have read the, I'm sure there's a detailed history

46:01.996 --> 46:18.240
written by the Army that someday when I'm not so 
busy I'm going to read, but it seemed that there

46:01.996 --> 46:18.240
just was not an advantageous place to commit us 
during those five months. Also, we had a great

46:19.342 --> 46:29.877
opportunity to continue training and get people 
into our outfits to that had actually been in

46:31.696 --> 46:35.039
combat up there in this different kind of 
fighting. So that was very advantageous. But I

46:36.501 --> 46:39.664
think the main reason was they just hadn't decided 
where to commit us. We were a strategic reserve

46:39.684 --> 46:44.588
those first five months, which is a very logical 
thing, too. Did you start jungle warfare tactic

46:44.748 --> 46:48.392
training then? You bet. And that was useful. And 
where'd you do that? Well, we went to a training

46:52.536 --> 46:54.678
area. It's not the same, but it was very similar. 
There was quite a lot of vegetation. Flinders

46:59.911 --> 47:01.699
Range, it's called. It's up from Brisbane. Oh, 
quite a long little way. I don't know, 75 or 100

47:06.421 --> 47:08.892
miles.
