WEBVTT

00:06.933 --> 00:14.203
Okay, this is Ron Shorn in Boulder, Colorado, 
interviewing Rita F. Beebe on October 21st, 1993.

00:15.785 --> 00:19.910
Rita, for the record, could you give your full 
name?

00:22.674 --> 00:24.416
Rita Faye Jenkins Beebe. Okay, and when and where 
were you born? In Pritchett, Colorado, October

00:28.061 --> 00:33.088
10th, 1936. How do you spell Pritchett? 
T-R-I-T-C-H-E-T-T but I don't believe it exists

00:35.536 --> 00:39.822
anymore. Where did you get interested in 
astronomy at the beginning?

00:47.291 --> 00:49.294
I had a strange childhood. I grew up near Boulder, 
Colorado. My father was 54 years old when I was

00:53.660 --> 00:57.525
born. He was a cow puncher in his younger days and 
had settled into ranching and farming by the time I

00:58.646 --> 01:05.475
came along. As a cowpuncher, he spent a 
considerable number of winters with remittance

01:06.333 --> 01:16.167
men in line shacks. And these people were people 
who were very well-schooled dropouts from

01:17.469 --> 01:24.418
Eastern culture in those days. My father's 
interest, having had only a third-grade

01:25.861 --> 01:30.467
education, was in nature and the knowledge he had 
accumulated was that of a naturalist in the old

01:31.088 --> 01:38.835
fashioned sense. So I grew up believing everybody 
knew about constellations and everybody asked

01:39.576 --> 01:47.122
questions about stars. I had mechanical 
tendencies and was frequently accused of

01:48.383 --> 01:56.711
stealing my father's tools when he lost them and 
that sort of thing and having no brothers to

01:48.383 --> 01:56.711
compete with. I was allowed to develop my 
interests I developed sort of a two-pronged

02:00.923 --> 02:12.697
interest in the fact that I also wanted to be an 
artist, and I actually spent the first two years of

02:00.923 --> 02:12.697
my college days majoring in art before I turned 
back to the physical sciences. Where did you go to

02:13.377 --> 02:16.020
undergraduate school? I went to art school at 
Washburn University in Topeka, Kansas, and the

02:16.040 --> 02:25.251
Kansas City Art Institute, and then returned to 
Colorado University. Why did you go to Kansas?

02:28.114 --> 02:28.635
Fellowships. All right, so then you went back 
after you left art school and went to? Colorado

02:34.483 --> 02:35.865
University. Okay, in Boulder. Yes. And what did 
you major in there? Chemistry. Chemistry. Why

02:40.533 --> 02:41.094
chemistry? Because at that time I was going to be a 
veterinarian, and I couldn't put the financial

02:42.176 --> 02:48.125
package together for that. So then I moved into 
teaching junior high school, junior high school,

02:54.637 --> 03:03.969
We went into an extensive curriculum 
development, and I moved into teaching earth

02:54.637 --> 03:03.969
science, and after three years of that, then I came 
back to graduate school. Okay, when did you get

03:04.509 --> 03:06.452
your bachelor's degree? Fifty-nine. Okay, and 
when did you enter graduate school? In 62, I guess?

03:12.119 --> 03:13.240
Yeah. Where did you go to grad school? Indiana 
University. Why did you pick Indiana? Previous to

03:17.114 --> 03:23.041
Indiana University, I went back to the University 
of Idaho for two years to upgrade my physics and

03:17.114 --> 03:23.041
mathematics. And then did a survey of graduate 
schools. And I got married in 59. So that parallel

03:31.710 --> 03:35.995
to my development, my husband was doing the same 
thing. So we were going to enter graduate school

03:36.055 --> 03:37.877
together. And we picked Indiana because they gave 
us a double financial package that we needed. How

03:43.793 --> 03:47.299
long did you stay at Indiana as a grad student? When 
did you get out? Sixty-nine. Sixty-nine. What was

03:49.983 --> 03:54.370
your doctoral dissertation and who was your 
advisor? The work was on R. Cygnus, a red giant star

03:55.672 --> 04:03.545
with anomalous heavy metal abundance. My thesis 
advisor was Benjamin Franklin Peary.

04:11.570 --> 04:14.413
OK, so you got your PhD in when? October of 69. I 
covered that. So where did you go after that? When

04:22.741 --> 04:24.182
did your husband get his degree? He got his in 
September of 69. He got a position at New Mexico

04:29.207 --> 04:34.933
State University as an assistant professor in 
astronomy. I had worked as a graduate student at

04:36.494 --> 04:40.378
Los Alamos. And at that time, there were not two 
jobs available. But I was well enough established

04:44.815 --> 04:50.203
at Los Alamos that I could continue to consult part 
time. And we were working on molecular opacities

04:50.423 --> 04:56.031
calculations. And that was quite compatible. The 
New Mexico State University gave me office space

04:58.554 --> 05:06.546
and computer access free of charge. So it was quite 
a comfortable arrangement. Okay, and what were

05:10.548 --> 05:13.371
you working on there? I was interacting with the 
Los Alamos group, working on opacities. Then in

05:19.056 --> 05:22.439
January of that year, I began to work with Brad 
Smith. Okay, how did that come about? Elmer Rees

05:26.663 --> 05:36.893
had developed quite a few measurements of drift 
rates of clouds in the atmosphere of Jupiter. He

05:37.784 --> 05:45.651
had lost his collaborator, Gordon Solberg, to 
controversial political issues and needed some

05:37.784 --> 05:45.651
assistance. So I started working just part time on 
the Los Alamos situation and part time for Brad

05:45.731 --> 05:56.640
Smith to help Elmer Reese with that 
interpretation.

05:59.323 --> 06:03.706
OK. How long did that happen? I mean, how long did 
you stay in that position doing that kind of work?

06:07.568 --> 06:21.406
After about a year, we wrote new proposals and I 
became fully funded in the study of Jupiter's

06:07.568 --> 06:21.406
atmosphere and worked as a research associate 
until 1974. Okay. And what did you do research on

06:23.649 --> 06:26.172
until 1974? Jupiter and Venus ground-based data. 
Okay. What kind of data? Photographic. Okay. What

06:36.931 --> 06:37.672
happened in 1974? 1974, Brad Smith left New Mexico 
State, moved to the University of Arizona. And I

06:46.400 --> 06:53.607
was selected to replace him as a tender track 
assistant professor of astronomy. And what's

06:53.627 --> 06:56.270
happened to your career since then? We continued 
to study Jupiter. And in 1977, I joined the Voyager

07:01.214 --> 07:05.098
team to assist in the targeting of the imaging and 
continue to work on that project. Since Voyager

07:13.153 --> 07:15.616
wound down, what have your interests been? I moved 
over to Hubble Space Telescope. I've been

07:21.964 --> 07:31.795
principal investigator on teams that are 
utilizing the WIFPIC planetary camera mode and

07:32.095 --> 07:47.158
the faint object spectrograph to do correlative 
studies of changes in wind fields, cloud wave

07:32.095 --> 07:47.158
formation, and spectroscopic data. When you 
first got into planetary astronomy, did you feel

07:47.819 --> 07:55.251
that real, quote, unquote, astronomy was 
considered at second rate?

07:58.606 --> 08:02.952
I have been known to say that I haven't experienced 
sexual discrimination. I've experienced racial

08:02.992 --> 08:06.718
discrimination. Yes, there has been a general 
tendency to do that. I consider it a lack of ego on

08:12.165 --> 08:16.211
their part. I think they feel grossly challenged 
because when we attempt to do our work, we have

08:16.291 --> 08:24.763
higher spatial resolution. We have more 
information. Our physical interpretations are

08:28.424 --> 08:34.651
frequently more sophisticated than theirs. Do 
you think planetary astronomy is a little more

08:34.911 --> 08:40.117
respected now than it was when you first got into 
the game? Yes, I think so.

08:45.182 --> 08:49.107
What was planetary astronomy like when you first 
got into it? I mean, size, attitudes, the kind of

08:49.207 --> 08:54.853
people that were in it as compared to now?

08:57.955 --> 09:12.353
Actually,

08:57.955 --> 09:12.353
by the time I really started participating in 
activities outside of New Mexico State, there was

08:57.955 --> 09:12.353
a fair amount of excitement about it. I remember 
the second Division of Planetary Sciences

09:15.216 --> 09:27.051
meeting was in Tallahassee.

09:27.925 --> 09:30.449
I found that meeting extremely exciting. I found 
another thing about it rather strange in the sense

09:31.450 --> 09:39.982
that I encountered strange discrimination. I was 
not allowed to buy my own drinks in that state at

09:40.002 --> 09:50.317
that time as a female, although I was at that point 
in time becoming recognized as a working

09:40.002 --> 09:50.317
scientist. The culture hadn't caught up with it 
yet, definitely. What's the best piece of work

09:55.684 --> 09:57.527
you've done?

10:01.422 --> 10:12.399
The

10:01.422 --> 10:12.399
coordination, the targeting, and the 
interpretation of Voyager 1 Jupiter encounter.

10:14.382 --> 10:23.295
The really satisfying thing about that encounter 
was, yes, we did know a lot about these clouds, and

10:14.382 --> 10:23.295
yes, we did know how to find them. And much of the 
work that we had done before that, that people felt

10:23.562 --> 10:31.674
might be over-interpreting the limited 
ground-based resolution, then became accepted.

10:32.315 --> 10:41.489
So that in retrospect, we could go backward and put 
even more physical constraints on the atmosphere

10:32.315 --> 10:41.489
than the Voyager data itself allowed. Did 
anything about the Voyager information about

10:42.571 --> 10:50.042
Jupiter surprise you?

10:58.105 --> 11:07.262
I hadn't done a lot of consideration about the 
magnetic field or the surface conditions of the

10:58.105 --> 11:07.262
satellites before we arrived. Those were 
surprising to me, and part of it was that I hadn't

11:07.803 --> 11:18.122
pushed as hard as I probably should have in those 
areas.

11:18.592 --> 11:22.577
the atmospheric results, I would say satisfied 
me. That was wonderful to see that much of what we

11:23.978 --> 11:31.167
thought was true really was and to just gain higher 
and higher resolution. Voyager 1 was wonderful

11:31.988 --> 11:42.861
because we had almost 90 days of that trip in the 
sense that every day I went in I was seeing a little

11:31.988 --> 11:42.861
higher resolution, a little more of the 
understanding, so it really was a wonderful

11:44.225 --> 11:47.233
thing. I'll never live through another trip like 
that. Have you had any dead ends or fiascos or

11:49.940 --> 11:56.817
things that you wish you wouldn't have gotten 
involved with? I wish I had the time back that I have

11:57.134 --> 12:05.963
spent trying to figure out what triggers 
disturbances in Jupiter's atmosphere. I've

12:06.003 --> 12:14.031
looked at almost every combination of 
satellites, tides, all sorts of things, and every

12:06.003 --> 12:14.031
one of them is just pulled up as a dead end. If I had 
that time back, I could probably do some very nice

12:14.111 --> 12:20.017
stuff with it. Where was your first encounter with 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration?

12:24.590 --> 12:29.136
When did they first give you money or put you on a 
board or something? Seventy-four. And that was?

12:31.118 --> 12:35.083
That was a grant,

12:31.118 --> 12:35.083
yes. Okay. All right, and you've had frequent 
contact with NASA since then. Quite so. How do you

12:41.432 --> 12:47.880
think they handle the management of planetary 
science in general? My feeling is that the people

12:47.960 --> 12:54.208
who have been managing my contracts are 
excellent. It's the structure above that. And the

12:58.756 --> 13:05.041
financial structures have become very 
complicated. Gerard de Bacallure was very strong

13:06.142 --> 13:21.776
in saying that he was really annoyed at the fact 
that NASA would get some pretty pictures out of a

13:06.142 --> 13:21.776
probe and then not support the follow-on 
research, just cut things off. Did you find that

13:22.437 --> 13:23.638
was true? I have aggressively worked to keep M.O. 
and D.A. financed over the years, and yes, it's a

13:33.175 --> 13:43.586
constant problem, and it's a real problem simply 
because it is the one thing that can be delayed. So

13:45.067 --> 13:51.634
that it's sitting there always vulnerable for any 
sort of a taxation or a budget cut It's the one

13:52.171 --> 13:56.197
that's sticking out in the wind ready to be clipped 
off. And that's not just NASA. That happens

14:01.243 --> 14:05.349
everywhere, in business and everywhere. You can 
always delay the fine analysis of a project so that

14:05.369 --> 14:13.801
it's just an ongoing problem. People who are 
involved in it will continually have to fight.

14:20.189 --> 14:20.710
Where do you think Planetary astronomy today 
would be if it wasn't for the money that NASA put

14:21.348 --> 14:27.294
into it in the last 30 years.

14:30.797 --> 14:34.461
Well, I suppose it would still be back in the realm 
of astrology, quite frankly. Because there

14:36.263 --> 14:42.269
really was a huge resistance to letting it grow 
academically. And that came not only from the

14:42.409 --> 14:47.794
classical astronomers, but it also came from the 
classical physicists. because it was their

14:48.162 --> 14:51.787
territory that would be encroached in academia. 
And without NASA, this area would have been

14:52.448 --> 14:58.096
expected to exist in academia. There were several 
big funding crunches in NASA history. One was in

15:03.743 --> 15:07.909
73, one was in 81, and it looks like we're getting 
another one now. And things have been tight for a

15:09.291 --> 15:12.195
number of years. When you get an intelligent 
student or intelligent students who say, gee, I

15:12.580 --> 15:26.577
want to go into grad school and be a planetary 
astronomer, what do you tell them now? Well, I have

15:26.597 --> 15:39.533
a discussion with them about the potential, but my 
own attitude, which I convey to them, is that if

15:26.597 --> 15:39.533
they are good enough, they will probably be able to 
survive in it. and quite frankly, if they wanted to

15:40.424 --> 15:53.475
become an architect, or any of the other applied 
physical sciences where your real survival is

15:40.424 --> 15:53.475
your own creativity, they'll have the same kind of 
tough time. Now, if they're second rate, I will do

15:54.636 --> 16:03.825
my best to encourage them to decide that they 
really would rather do something else. There's

16:04.265 --> 16:08.929
been some talk lately of turning NASA into the 
national... Aeronautics Administration giving

16:09.095 --> 16:16.405
space research to the Air Force, who already does a 
lot. And of course, before there was an NSA, the Air

16:17.447 --> 16:28.543
Force poured a lot of money into planetary 
astronomy and related topics.

16:28.743 --> 16:31.487
If that happened, would you mind working for the 
Air Force? No.

16:36.247 --> 16:40.433
We're at a division for... Don't forget I've 
already worked for Los Alamos. I like the idea that

16:40.453 --> 16:48.966
there are a few intelligent people working for the 
agencies who develop our ability to go to war. I

16:49.407 --> 16:53.433
don't want that left to people who are warriors by 
nature.

16:56.197 --> 17:03.148
We're at the Division for Planetary Sciences of 
the American Astronomical Society meeting. 25

17:03.820 --> 17:10.288
years ago, 26 years ago, there was no special 
organization for planetary astronomy. And in

17:10.969 --> 17:14.032
fact, there was no special journal for planetary 
astronomy. And now there's Icarus and also the

17:14.052 --> 17:19.619
Journal for Geophysical Research-Planet. Do you 
think that this specialization has been good,

17:21.001 --> 17:27.729
bad, indifferent, inevitable? What's your 
opinion? I think the specialization has been

17:29.591 --> 17:33.456
good. I think the fact that it's been recognized as 
an area that should have been pursued and

17:33.605 --> 17:44.745
developed has changed the basic attitude of 
ordinary people. When you walk into an elementary

17:44.765 --> 17:56.727
classroom or a group of freshman students, their 
concept of their surroundings has been grossly

17:44.765 --> 17:56.727
modified by the space program. and it's been 
modified in a constructive way in the sense that

17:57.685 --> 18:06.939
they have been able to see more than one planet. 
They have seen things that are as spectacular as

18:07.680 --> 18:25.988
science fiction can deliver to them, and they have 
been introduced to the concept of cause and effect

18:07.680 --> 18:25.988
in a very graphical way that has led them not only to 
know that this sort of logic exists, but to expect

18:27.048 --> 18:33.376
it, to expect there to be an explanation of the 
spectacular. Since you've done both, you're an

18:35.098 --> 18:52.520
appropriate person to ask, do you ever get annoyed 
when some popular book or TV show claims that

18:35.098 --> 18:52.520
spacecraft discovered everything we know about 
the solar

18:35.098 --> 18:52.520
system? It doesn't bother me that much. Because 
quite honestly,

18:55.803 --> 19:08.083
spacecraft has brought it to the attention of the 
public. I certainly attempt to correct that over

19:08.263 --> 19:12.650
time. Do you think that planetary astronomy is a 
part of astronomy? Definitely. Just, there's one

19:18.720 --> 19:21.404
other thing I don't know. Astronomy is a part of 
NASA. The traditional astronomy is, by a very

19:24.490 --> 19:31.300
large part, now funded by NASA. The breakdown 
between NSF and NASA is shocking to me. I mean, the

19:38.671 --> 19:44.640
entire field of astronomy is now dependent, for 
most of its support, from NASA. This came with the

19:45.402 --> 19:50.329
development of the great observatory projects 
and that sort of thing. Like the Hubble Space

19:50.427 --> 19:51.589
Telescope. The shift is huge. NSF is supporting 
very little of the whole astronomical academic

19:53.192 --> 20:01.846
community at this point. Do you think that's good 
or bad? I think it's bad. I think we've slid into a

20:04.190 --> 20:06.774
situation. Any time you have federal funding for 
projects that are pushing technology, the number

20:15.082 --> 20:23.953
of people in the field will expand to the limit that 
those projects can accept. And we've had this

20:23.973 --> 20:31.002
major expansion in all of the areas, and it can't 
continue to expand. The fact that we're suffering

20:33.165 --> 20:43.958
a budget crunch is caused by many different 
aspects, and one is 25 years of expansion of these

20:33.165 --> 20:43.958
fields. Let me ask you, how old do you consider 
planetary astronomy to be? Because there's two

20:52.594 --> 20:53.775
schools of thought. One says it didn't really 
begin until Galileo had the sky in the telescope.

21:00.464 --> 21:10.058
And others would say, well, it started back when 
the first Swiss lake dweller looked at the sky and

21:00.464 --> 21:10.058
saw that Venus was this bright thing in the sky 
after sunset. What's your opinion? Actually, I

21:12.221 --> 21:13.202
think Planetary science as such really started in 
the 50s.

21:24.205 --> 21:29.217
Before that, it was a part of our natural science 
lore. And in the 1950s, people began to understand

21:29.652 --> 21:39.966
spectroscopy enough to realize that they could do 
some very significant remote sensing. They began

21:41.288 --> 21:45.314
to look for general physical explanations. They 
began to do detailed studies. A classical one is

21:47.757 --> 21:51.443
Kuiper's study of trying to understand the red 
spot. A beautiful study in the sense that that,

21:55.268 --> 22:04.246
again, here was the real realization that we could 
expand ourselves, stretch ourselves, and really

21:55.268 --> 22:04.246
push the concept of cause and effect. And to me, 
that was the point that the field that we call

22:06.150 --> 22:13.885
planetary science, where we're really relating 
other planets to the Earth instead of saying these

22:14.692 --> 22:21.422
are wonderful things with some mystic properties 
associated with them. We're saying these are

22:21.442 --> 22:25.067
different cases of the same thing we have here. To 
me, that's when planetary science, as I see

22:25.107 --> 22:30.475
planetary science, began. Of all the discoveries 
that have come about in the last 30 years, what Was

22:39.245 --> 22:45.871
it really most astounding to you, the one that 
you'd say, I never would have thought of that, or I

22:39.245 --> 22:45.871
never would have believed that? The volcanoes on 
Mars. There was just something wonderful about

22:47.952 --> 22:52.136
them. I was ready to accept that Mars had never had 
plate tectonics. But it had never occurred to me

22:58.741 --> 23:08.830
that instead of plate tectonics, you would have 
activity that just sat there and piled up. That

23:09.603 --> 23:14.128
concept is just neat. Do you think planetary 
astronomers and planetary scientists have done a

23:15.249 --> 23:27.042
good job in selling themselves, or as good a job as 
they could have, to the public and to the Congress?

23:27.062 --> 23:31.727
I think they've done an excellent job of selling 
themselves to the public. I travel a lot. I'm on a

23:33.970 --> 23:36.032
lot of committees. And if I'm on a plane and 
somebody opens a conversation that I really don't

23:36.265 --> 23:46.258
want to pursue, asking me what I do, I tell them I'm 
an astrophysicist and that's the end of that

23:36.265 --> 23:46.258
conversation. I tell them I work in planetary 
science and the conversation will last until the

23:47.540 --> 23:52.426
plane lands. I think that's a good measure of the 
fact we've done it. Selling ourselves to

23:56.431 --> 23:57.933
Congress. That's another question.

24:05.442 --> 24:16.019
I think we've probably done a better job of that 
than most of the other physical sciences.

24:16.901 --> 24:32.226
What effect, if any, do you think on the public 
interest and funding is the fact that we found no

24:16.901 --> 24:32.226
trace whatsoever of light anywhere in the solar 
system except Earth, and in particular not on

24:16.901 --> 24:32.226
Mars?

24:33.640 --> 24:57.960
i think that stimulated our funding uh during the 
period of time that we were on our survey of the

24:33.640 --> 24:57.960
solar system mode we're now past that i think it may 
actually curtail our funding now because i think

24:33.640 --> 24:57.960
what we have done with that is that we have made 
people more aware that this is all we got and we

24:33.640 --> 24:57.960
better save it so i think in the long run our efforts 
have actually done a better job of selling the need

24:58.852 --> 25:08.688
to really understand this planet as a unit, so that 
we probably enhanced the area we now refer to as

24:58.852 --> 25:08.688
Earth Sciences.

25:11.553 --> 25:17.122
How did planetary studies get started at New 
Mexico State? In the 50s, Clyde W. Tombaugh, who

25:17.142 --> 25:25.315
had moved to White Sands, At White Sands, he set up 
tracking cameras for studying the ballistic

25:25.649 --> 25:35.586
trajectories of various test rockets and that 
sort of thing. And in the mid-'50s, he decided that

25:36.367 --> 25:46.324
he wanted to free himself up from some of the 
details that he was forced to accept if he

25:46.912 --> 25:51.417
continued to live at the White Sands Proving 
Grounds. So he requested the right from the

25:52.098 --> 25:59.447
military to move his contracts to New Mexico State 
University, which was a small university. Its

26:00.288 --> 26:06.415
research was centered in the central office, 
which would give him first class service. So he

26:06.936 --> 26:08.698
moved to New Mexico State. Among the people that he 
had acquired to work with him at White Sands was

26:09.639 --> 26:16.868
Bradford Smith. And after they moved to New Mexico 
State, the two of them worked as a team to develop

26:17.962 --> 26:39.165
ground-based monitoring of basically Mars when 
they first started, with an eye toward

26:17.962 --> 26:39.165
understanding the seasonal aspects for space 
exploration. And then later they acquired the

26:39.185 --> 26:46.213
services of Elmer Rees, a gifted amateur 
astronomer all of the right attributes to be an

26:46.666 --> 27:01.958
outstanding observational scientist where did 
they get the money to do this at first it was air

26:46.666 --> 27:01.958
force and then they moved to nasa for me okay and 
then uh Were you the next hire that came along? No.

27:05.467 --> 27:10.756
Clyde had a faculty slot in Earth Sciences. And he 
expanded his contracts to the point that he had an

27:11.818 --> 27:22.215
observing team, which I think he had as many as five 
observers on staff at a time. I was the first PhD to

27:22.235 --> 27:26.983
join his staff. And Clyde was still the PI of the 
group when I joined, although he retired soon

27:27.908 --> 27:35.479
after that, and Brad Smith became the PI. Now, what 
happened then? I mean, what department were you

27:39.545 --> 27:42.249
in? I was in earth science. And in 1969, the 
astronomy separated from earth science and

27:45.414 --> 27:56.751
became an individual department.

27:58.672 --> 28:01.760
William Reitmeier was the department head. And by 
the time I arrived, there were three

28:01.800 --> 28:11.685
stellar galactic type astronomers. And Herb 
Beebe was the theoretician. He was actually a

28:17.570 --> 28:19.873
solar astronomer. So the fact that the Sacramento 
Peak Observatory was there was extremely

28:20.494 --> 28:31.209
attractive to him, because he could do his 
observing there and then do his modeling at the

28:20.494 --> 28:31.209
university. Well, what's happened since then? I 
mean, what's happened to the astronomy

28:34.214 --> 28:38.260
department? Has it grown much? Over the years, we 
attempted several times to set up an effective

28:40.437 --> 28:47.806
consortium to build a large telescope. And we have 
managed to do that. University of Chicago,

28:54.455 --> 29:04.528
Princeton University, University of Washington 
and Washington State and New Mexico State have

28:54.455 --> 29:04.528
developed a consortium. Recently, Johns Hopkins 
and the Institute of Advanced Studies at

29:08.720 --> 29:11.873
Princeton have come in. We have a three and a half 
meter honeycomb-type

29:16.178 --> 29:25.690
Naismith-focused telescope that will be coming 
online within the next six months. It's now

29:25.790 --> 29:27.472
waiting for its secondary. Everything else is in 
position and tested. And it will be located, it is

29:30.596 --> 29:32.678
located at? Apache Peak, which is 100 miles from 
the campus on paved, maintained roads. And we have

29:41.086 --> 29:43.891
remote observing capabilities. How many faculty 
do you have now in the astronomy department? We

29:49.741 --> 29:53.528
have two planetary astronomers that are on tenure 
track. Myself is tenured, and we have a junior

29:54.750 --> 30:00.160
person who has been with us for a year and a half. 
That's Mark Marley.

30:04.373 --> 30:13.466
Jack Burns is our current department head, and he 
is a radio astronomer, interacts considerably

30:04.373 --> 30:13.466
with the VLA. Rene Walterbos, galactic 
astronomy. Walt Sanders and

30:19.034 --> 30:34.195
Kurt Anderson, both

30:19.034 --> 30:34.195
stellar population galactic structure types. 
Bernie McNamara, variable stars, catastrophic

30:34.748 --> 30:41.036
variable stars.

30:43.740 --> 30:46.424
That's the tenure track group. We have Bill Weber, 
retired from New Hampshire, high energy

30:47.705 --> 30:54.414
astrophysics. He's a university professor. Nick 
Devereaux, a young NASA investigator. Galactic

31:02.693 --> 31:04.916
astronomy. Andre Klippen, the Tombaugh Fellow. 
We have developed an endowment in honor of Clyde

31:10.966 --> 31:14.331
Tombaugh. And Andre, a Soviet cosmologist, is our 
first fellow.

31:25.367 --> 31:28.793
Do you planetary types talk with the other 
astronomers much? Oh, yes, yes. As a matter of

31:30.925 --> 31:41.722
fact, the major thrust that's developing in 
galactic astronomy at New Mexico State is

31:30.925 --> 31:41.722
hydrodynamics.

31:42.403 --> 31:47.812
Yes, because hydrodynamics is quite well 
developed in planetary astronomy. Mark Marley is

31:47.892 --> 31:52.980
quite interested in energy balance in the upper 
atmosphere, and so am I. So the overlaps with the

31:56.761 --> 32:02.857
Most newly acquired galactic people are open, 
friendly, and very collaborative. Some of the

32:03.038 --> 32:12.964
older traditional astronomers are still sitting 
off in their stuffy corners, but they're

32:03.038 --> 32:12.964
literally isolated from both sides now. Well, of 
course, you have the advantage that you don't just

32:13.214 --> 32:18.868
have a snapshot, which is all you get. You can 
actually see things changing on Jupiter, which

32:19.530 --> 32:25.384
makes it a little more tricky to make predictions. 
Actually, our radio astronomers can see things

32:25.765 --> 32:30.818
changing, too. supersonic jets change with time, 
too. So the concepts of modeling and displaying

32:34.864 --> 32:40.694
time changes and that sort of thing really do 
overlap. That brings me to another point, which is

32:41.134 --> 32:52.292
that radio astronomy, which is what I started out 
in, was really founded not by astronomers but by

32:41.134 --> 32:52.292
engineers. And in the Well, the 40s and the 50s. It 
had a hard time getting started in this country

32:58.798 --> 33:09.052
because the astronomers at the time had about the 
same attitude towards the dirty engineering work

32:58.798 --> 33:09.052
as they did towards looking at the planets. And 
radio astronomy has never had a bias, as far as I

33:10.194 --> 33:16.943
know, against planetary astronomy. How do you get 
along with the radio astronomers now? because

33:22.064 --> 33:23.766
it's a new generation of people. The old timers are 
mostly gone. But I wanted your opinion on that. And

33:28.092 --> 33:31.617
many of the numerics are so parallel.

33:34.582 --> 33:40.069
Around the turn of this century, planetary 
astronomy was still a significant part of

33:34.582 --> 33:40.069
astronomy. Henry Norris Russell did papers on the 
atmosphere of Venus and so forth. But by the end of

33:45.959 --> 33:49.466
World War I, it was basically dead. I mean, there 
were a few people still working, but it was

33:49.486 --> 33:53.134
basically dead. Who or what killed it, in your 
opinion? probably

33:59.037 --> 34:20.117
the lack of infrared observations coming along at 
the right time we really had a dearth of new

33:59.037 --> 34:20.117
observational input and most of the interesting 
spectral features are in the infrared,

34:22.122 --> 34:26.168
unfortunately. The development of large 
telescopes that did not enhance our spatial

34:26.188 --> 34:36.242
resolution sort of made the planets not that 
desirable. And then the fact that we weren't able

34:37.003 --> 34:48.320
to use those large light buckets to reach into 
another frequency domain and give us some more

34:37.003 --> 34:48.320
constraints is probably what really put it down. 
Gerard de Bacalaur has a... vehement two-word

34:51.097 --> 34:53.520
answer to that question. Percival Law. Do you 
think that would have an effect?

35:00.990 --> 35:02.553
No, I don't. I think the fact that you see too many 
bubbles of air, Earth's air, in a big telescope had

35:02.573 --> 35:18.294
the biggest effect because much of the money was 
being recruited to support the big telescopes.

35:18.314 --> 35:20.597
And we really weren't competitive on them. really 
couldn't pull new, exciting information out. If

35:24.962 --> 35:32.871
the spatial resolution had been directly 
proportional to the diameter of the telescope,

35:24.962 --> 35:32.871
Percival Lowell couldn't have touched us. The 
idea of what we would have seen on Mars would have

35:33.832 --> 35:41.682
just been so intriguing that... I wanted to ask 
your... This is a detail that may not get in the

35:43.003 --> 35:46.467
book, but I want your opinion. You know, now with 
CCDs, you can beat the scene and take pictures of,

35:47.543 --> 36:01.540
in particular, Mars, that look like the sort of 
stuff that those of us who have looked at Mars

35:47.543 --> 36:01.540
through telescopes will occasionally see but 
could never photograph or even draw.

36:07.727 --> 36:14.055
Were you relieved to see that those images 
actually were just like what you'd been seeing in

36:07.727 --> 36:14.055
the past? Sure. The idea of being able to record and 
then go back and analyze is always exciting. Sure,

36:23.281 --> 36:24.642
you believe what you see. After you understand how 
the human eye interprets things, you know that

36:24.843 --> 36:30.988
those details are there. But you can't remember 
them. You can't intercompare them. The classical

36:37.455 --> 36:43.200
example of this is Elmer Rees, who had observed an 
excellent observer. And when he was finally

36:43.535 --> 37:07.667
allowed to have the A Mountain, the Tortugas 
Mountain, photographic record, so he could go

36:43.535 --> 37:07.667
back and see what a south equatorial belt storm 
looked like in 71 and compare it to 75, it was like,

36:43.535 --> 37:07.667
you know, manna from heaven to him. One thing 
that's been a petty annoyance of mine, and I wonder

37:07.687 --> 37:11.432
if it's been of yours, is that the pictures they 
release of Mars and the whole disk from various

37:11.969 --> 37:16.849
spacecraft don't look like it looks when you look 
directly at it. They fiddle around with the data.

37:24.961 --> 37:27.123
Does that kind of tick you off? Yes, it kind of ticks 
me off. And there's a fair amount of it going on now

37:28.565 --> 37:32.169
in ground base, too. High pass filtering, edge 
finders being used to really enhance the edge

37:32.830 --> 37:44.203
structures, total destruction of the 
photometry. One of the things that bothers me a

37:44.707 --> 38:02.050
little bit about the Voyager representation of 
Jupiter is the fact that in order to get high

37:44.707 --> 38:02.050
contrast images into the American living room, we 
grossly enhance the color. And we have left the

38:02.912 --> 38:09.300
public with the concept of the appearance of these 
cloud decks. It's wrong. Lately, there's been a

38:11.251 --> 38:24.165
fair amount of effort to make planetary science 
practical, and there's certainly been a lot of

38:11.251 --> 38:24.165
publicity about killer asteroids and comets, the 
ozone layer, global warming. Do you think that's

38:26.368 --> 38:31.774
gone too far, or do you think it's just about right, 
or not enough? I think it's gone too far. I don't

38:33.475 --> 38:37.760
think that that is the real application of 
planetary science. I think that... The real

38:42.082 --> 38:52.997
application of planetary science in the field of 
education is the idea of physical processes. More

38:54.880 --> 39:05.295
than one laboratory to understand what has gone on 
over time, developing the general understanding

38:54.880 --> 39:05.295
of time dependence on Earth. We could do real 
structures there. Killer asteroids is... I don't

39:10.685 --> 39:12.847
think planetary people invented that. I think SDI 
people invented that, looking for a home. And I

39:17.953 --> 39:19.715
think that's appalling. I think it's misleading. 
I think it's asking the American public to pay

39:23.980 --> 39:37.755
attention to something that is not as likely to 
happen as some of the other pending catastrophes

39:23.980 --> 39:37.755
that we should be expending resources on.

39:39.322 --> 39:40.524
What do you think is going to happen? Well, first of 
all, do you think planetary astronomy is kind of

39:40.564 --> 39:46.792
mined out now or not? No, I don't think so. I think 
that...

39:49.415 --> 39:55.303
Well, I talk to elementary students a lot. 
Elementary students are ready to go to the moon,

39:56.945 --> 40:01.450
even if they have to live in a hole. As long as I will 
let them have television, they would love to go to

40:01.531 --> 40:05.996
the moon. The concept of a 14-day... day is 
fascinating to them. Sixth graders would like to

40:13.530 --> 40:29.792
take pregnant women to the moon so they can watch 
the children grow up under low G.

40:13.530 --> 40:29.792
It's this concept of just a little different 
environment. I think we've still got a lot of very

40:31.614 --> 40:35.299
interesting stimulating this same toward really 
improving education really improving critical

40:35.903 --> 41:05.269
ability do you think there will be money to support 
planetary strategy no I think we're headed toward

40:35.903 --> 41:05.269
period time where support really is going to 
decrease and then I think that maybe 20 years from

41:05.519 --> 41:32.893
now we'll we'll see an increase in interest in it 
again and it'll come back um i forgot to ask you one

41:05.519 --> 41:32.893
thing about the situation in new mexico state now 
it was a small college 30 years ago what was how

41:05.519 --> 41:32.893
would you characterize the attitude of the 
higher-ups there you know whatever they are the

41:05.519 --> 41:32.893
regents or the deans or the presidents or 
chancellors towards having um you know, a real

41:33.177 --> 41:36.422
research group, and in particular astronomy. 
Were they amazed that there was such a subject? No,

41:39.627 --> 41:57.075
not at all, because the proper people of Pasadena 
chased the Caltech people out of Arroyo Sepe to the

41:39.627 --> 41:57.075
White Sands Proving Ground, so that the 
development of The space program is very closely

41:57.528 --> 42:04.834
associated with New Mexico in the minds of most of 
the people there. The first

42:05.895 --> 42:18.606
satellite that was to go into Earth orbit that 
didn't get off the launch pad carried a

42:05.895 --> 42:18.606
communications package that had been built at New 
Mexico State. New Mexico State has been very

42:19.627 --> 42:27.113
strong in telemetry and communications, so that 
we came in two this area from the technological

42:27.481 --> 42:36.249
side, and the physical science was second to 
develop there, but it was natural that it did

42:27.481 --> 42:36.249
develop there. New Mexico State has a very large 
involvement in military funding.

42:47.159 --> 42:56.728
They entrap, process, and deliver a large portion 
of the data that's acquired at the White Sands

42:47.159 --> 42:56.728
Missile Range.

42:59.662 --> 43:12.695
You're undoubtedly aware of the fact that 
astronomy is, I guess, without astronomy in

42:59.662 --> 43:12.695
general and planetary astronomy in particular, 
is the most popular science with the general

42:59.662 --> 43:12.695
public. How come?

43:19.322 --> 43:23.646
Well, it's not quite as mundane as Earth-based 
science. There's still a little bit of the

43:23.706 --> 43:27.610
fascination of science fiction in it. But at the 
same time, because people have been living on a

43:29.362 --> 43:35.989
planet, they've got all the fundamental basis for 
understanding it. So it's something that's

43:36.109 --> 43:40.654
familiar but mind-stretching at the same time. 
It's been my opinion that astronomy is the best

43:42.976 --> 43:52.286
carrot that you can use as a teacher to get people to 
learn science. Do you agree?

43:56.391 --> 43:56.871
No. and elementary students like bugs just as well 
when does that start to change about the sixth

43:58.150 --> 44:20.327
grade any idea why

43:58.150 --> 44:20.327
i guess they get tired of bugs when you've done 
grasshoppers too how far can you go
