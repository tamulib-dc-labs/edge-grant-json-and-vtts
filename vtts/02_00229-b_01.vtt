WEBVTT

00:01.634 --> 00:03.697
In fact, it was doing the best that you can.

00:03.717 --> 00:07.742
Can you think of other ones, other ideas that your parents?

00:08.383 --> 00:11.447
And I always believe this, even in sports.

00:11.567 --> 00:24.283
For example, we didn't have, out on the farm, we didn't have opportunities to do many of the things that are available to rural youth today.

00:24.423 --> 00:27.047
We didn't have 4-H at that time.

00:27.227 --> 00:31.152
It came to be just when I was finishing high school.

00:33.005 --> 00:44.324
So I used to, Sunday after church, I would take my .22 rifle and go hunting, and mostly I was seeing what made things go in the fall and in the winter.

00:44.344 --> 00:45.886
I had the strap on.

00:45.906 --> 00:56.083
But quite apart from this, I used to think, and my grandfather used to make me think there too.

00:56.103 --> 00:58.928
He'd say, why are those trees dying?

01:00.865 --> 01:02.367
And I got to be inquisitive.

01:03.488 --> 01:09.776
The fruit bodies of the fungi that rot the dead trees.

01:09.796 --> 01:14.021
I'd bring these in to Granddad and I'd say, what are these things?

01:15.984 --> 01:17.325
What are they doing growing there?

01:18.407 --> 01:19.448
At a pretty early age.

01:20.349 --> 01:26.637
Well, he couldn't tell me scientifically what they were, but he knew that they were rotting the wood.

01:28.034 --> 01:30.096
I don't think he knew whether it was the same one.

01:30.236 --> 01:31.097
I'm sure he didn't.

01:31.117 --> 01:33.240
It was something else that had killed a tree.

01:33.620 --> 01:35.382
But he always used to ask questions.

01:35.402 --> 01:37.224
Why are these things dying?

01:37.244 --> 01:41.108
He had his own ideas, probably generally wrong.

01:41.128 --> 01:45.012
But he used to ask some questions.

01:48.536 --> 01:55.223
And along the way, also in the work, for example, I mentioned the thrashing

01:55.979 --> 02:02.148
Another long struggle, this was just between the two farms, was making the hay for all the animals.

02:02.168 --> 02:08.959
That went on for two or three weeks, or sometimes maybe even a month.

02:08.979 --> 02:14.487
So this is, it was these years that you learned to get along with people and to work with people?

02:14.627 --> 02:25.243
Yeah, and grandfather, the one thing that he used to always want to do was to run the mower, cut the grass, and every noon,

02:26.472 --> 02:54.808
when after as soon as we'd eat he'd say come on i have to sharpen the sickle i'd go out there and i'd have to turn that damn grindstone when he and pour water on the grindstone when he would chop in the sickle so it wasn't so hard on the horses every noon and every night after we got done this was the ritual and i think that was part of the work ethic you did it from the time you were a little guy just able to

02:55.497 --> 03:01.205
In other words, you didn't quit the job until you were finished?

03:01.225 --> 03:01.365
No.

03:01.786 --> 03:02.587
No goofing off.

03:05.210 --> 03:13.923
In the same way, if grandmother was going to make soap, I had the job of putting all the wood chips underneath and keeping that fire going.

03:13.943 --> 03:21.513
When it got to the point where you put the Lewis Lye in the thing and you might get scalded or burned, it would chase you away.

03:22.795 --> 03:24.357
Always there were those little things.

03:25.130 --> 03:28.313
go out and collect the eggs, feed the chickens.

03:29.074 --> 03:30.495
All of these were parts of the soil.

03:30.515 --> 03:34.819
Industry then was another thing that you learned growing up.

03:35.240 --> 03:36.281
Right.

03:36.301 --> 03:41.286
And I learned that there could be fun in these things if you learn something along the way.

03:41.306 --> 03:45.910
And I used to ask my grandfather and later my dad too, what about that?

03:46.050 --> 03:47.452
Why is it this way?

03:47.472 --> 03:51.135
And then the spirit of trying to do the best you can.

03:52.056 --> 03:52.977
We didn't have

03:53.480 --> 04:09.919
athletics and sports back in the countryside, but even before I started high school or when I was starting, in addition to the high school sports, we used to have our country baseball team.

04:09.939 --> 04:19.690
I used to organize this and we used to play out in the call pastures and sometimes when I'd slide into third base, it wasn't the third base, the call had been there before, but

04:20.075 --> 04:26.222
That's the kind of thing we did, and we had some surprisingly good teams for just country boys.

04:26.423 --> 04:31.108
We'd take on some of the big towns, and sometimes we'd lick them.

04:31.128 --> 04:39.899
And I think a lot of it was that we worked together for quite a few years, and this was a spirit.

04:39.919 --> 04:43.002
And I think that carried through into high school.

04:43.723 --> 04:48.529
I used to like competitive athletics in high school and in the university as well.

04:49.555 --> 04:55.544
And is there something else back in the farm that I'm forgetting?

04:55.784 --> 04:57.848
No, no, no, no.

04:58.148 --> 05:07.182
When I got to high school, the principal was a man of... Wait a minute, wait a minute.

05:07.202 --> 05:07.723
You're right.

05:07.763 --> 05:12.089
I want to ask you something else before we get to high school, and that is about your siblings.

05:12.991 --> 05:17.217
Do you have a... I have a daughter who was one-year-old

05:17.821 --> 05:20.704
when she came to Mexico, a little more.

05:20.724 --> 05:21.925
No, your brothers and sisters.

05:22.085 --> 05:23.907
Oh, excuse me, excuse me.

05:24.888 --> 05:25.829
I have two sisters.

05:27.811 --> 05:28.492
There were three.

05:28.772 --> 05:33.316
One died in childbirth, apparently injured at the time of delivery.

05:34.057 --> 05:35.198
She lived only five days.

05:38.061 --> 05:46.950
My first sister, younger than I am by two years, Palma and Mrs. Behrens, she said,

05:47.420 --> 06:08.112
widow now, grew up, she went to Iowa State Teachers College and she just retired about a year ago after 38 years of teaching primary school, one of the top primary school teachers, kindergarten teachers I should say, in the state of Iowa.

06:08.212 --> 06:14.001
My younger sister, five years younger than I am, and Palma Behrens,

06:14.538 --> 06:20.044
as a son and a daughter, both of whom are grown and have families.

06:20.885 --> 06:33.298
My younger sister, youngest sister, Charlotte Culbert, finished high school.

06:33.539 --> 06:36.442
She was married pretty young in life to a farmer.

06:37.383 --> 06:42.489
And they retired, now live in the little town of Cresco.

06:42.509 --> 06:43.870
They have three.

06:45.217 --> 06:52.305
three children, all adults.

06:57.891 --> 07:07.942
I always, when we started talking, Dad and Mother and I, about university training, I said, I'll make it some way.

07:08.422 --> 07:11.085
You think it's Obama or my sisters.

07:11.605 --> 07:14.869
This was during the worst of the Depression.

07:15.727 --> 07:30.246
They had very little money left after the bank disaster, but they did have the farm clear, and I told you, by a good stroke of luck, they just bought all the materials for building, lumber for building the new barn.

07:31.627 --> 07:39.878
And so, even despite the hard times of the 30s, they were saving little money because we didn't spend much.

07:40.803 --> 07:48.473
And so when it came time, whether I was going to college or not, I stayed out after I graduated from high school.

07:50.876 --> 07:54.380
First, I stayed out one year before I went to high school.

07:54.400 --> 07:59.847
My mother thought I was too young after I finished the eighth grade.

08:01.549 --> 08:08.498
Besides, I had to go to Confirmation, Lutheran Confirmation.

08:09.203 --> 08:13.207
They didn't want me to do this because I was too young when I was in the eighth grade.

08:15.170 --> 08:17.753
And so I stayed out, but I went to school anyway.

08:17.833 --> 08:28.024
I just kind of went to the second year, eighth grade, and gave me a little more time to read, although I didn't have any books in the library, very few.

08:28.084 --> 08:29.786
But I enjoyed it.

08:31.748 --> 08:35.312
School was always pleasant to me.

08:36.052 --> 08:46.526
Then after I went to high school, I stayed out one year also before I went to the university, because that was the worst of the depression.

08:47.107 --> 08:55.899
And I got a little money together just working in whatever I could do during thrashing, saved all of it in this little trap line.

08:55.919 --> 09:02.588
I guess I had the magnificent sum of $150 that I saved up, which got me started.

09:02.608 --> 09:04.911
And I should have pointed out that in the high school,

09:05.448 --> 09:13.982
I got interested in athletics and I played football and wrestling.

09:15.505 --> 09:17.629
You were telling a story about your sister.

09:18.470 --> 09:20.433
Oh, about my sister.

09:21.034 --> 09:26.303
So we decided this was when I was getting ready to go to college.

09:27.485 --> 09:31.472
Dad says, well, I don't have much that I can help you with, but

09:31.857 --> 09:33.038
I'll help you all I can.

09:33.058 --> 09:36.302
And I said, let me try it alone.

09:36.322 --> 09:42.750
You, whatever you can give to my sister, Alma, better save for that, Charlotte later.

09:43.771 --> 09:46.394
So that was agreed.

09:46.414 --> 09:51.100
And that's the way it worked out.

09:51.500 --> 09:53.543
And so that's how she got to go to college.

09:53.563 --> 09:55.305
College, right.

09:55.325 --> 09:58.168
Well, then let's go back to

09:58.823 --> 10:02.969
the years, the 8th grade, 9th grade, 10th grade, senior high school.

10:03.189 --> 10:04.371
What were your favorite subjects?

10:07.235 --> 10:20.353
Well, at that time when I got to high school, I thought with the way things were going, I was almost certain to be a farmer.

10:20.373 --> 10:22.636
So I took Smith Hughes Agriculture.

10:22.656 --> 10:25.801
This was the agricultural high school course.

10:26.442 --> 10:27.463
And it so happened that

10:29.114 --> 10:39.844
We had a very young, dynamic teacher who was just fresh out of Iowa State, Harry Schroeder, and he spent his entire life there.

10:42.606 --> 10:51.894
Won the Outstanding Teacher Award for the State of Iowa and died in a tragic fishing accident.

10:52.435 --> 10:57.079
He and two other high school teachers, when they were up fishing,

10:58.088 --> 11:10.118
Spring of the year, they went in a cabin, a wasp had built a nest in the chimney, and they came in tired and left their fish inside the bed and there were rods.

11:10.559 --> 11:11.760
They found them three days later.

11:11.800 --> 11:21.048
They'd been cast from carbon monoxide, from dioxide, monoxide, from the flue on the stove.

11:22.789 --> 11:24.451
My goodness, that is terrible.

11:24.491 --> 11:25.592
I've never even heard of that.

11:26.613 --> 11:27.994
Talk about an unusual thing.

11:28.902 --> 11:32.766
Found them all dead.

11:32.786 --> 11:35.469
Well, anyway, he was an excellent teacher.

11:36.209 --> 11:40.954
And he used to also tell me, well, you've got to go to the university.

11:41.014 --> 11:44.278
If you go to the university, you like agriculture good and well.

11:45.038 --> 11:47.481
You've got a good background for it.

11:48.001 --> 11:50.804
And he used to be on the wrestling team in Iowa State also.

11:51.545 --> 11:52.686
He was a big burly guy.

11:53.847 --> 11:58.352
But the principal was a little guy by the name of Dave Bartelma.

11:58.822 --> 12:08.773
And he was a strong disciplinarian, no monkey business, but also an excellent teacher.

12:08.793 --> 12:12.437
And he was the wrestling coach.

12:14.238 --> 12:18.303
And so I went out for wrestling, and I got pretty close to him.

12:19.704 --> 12:27.833
And he made this little town into one of the hot spots of wrestling.

12:28.420 --> 12:29.882
throughout the United States.

12:31.724 --> 12:33.846
Less than 3,000 people.

12:33.866 --> 12:45.579
Out of our ten-man high school team, when I was senior, seven of those kids wrestled later on Big Ten or Big Six teams.

12:45.599 --> 12:48.983
And two of them were national champions.

12:49.003 --> 12:50.785
And that's the way he was.

12:50.805 --> 12:51.806
He was organized.

12:54.069 --> 12:57.853
And when I went to Minnesota, after my... Did you wrestle for him?

12:58.188 --> 12:58.729
Yes.

12:58.749 --> 12:59.389
Wow.

12:59.409 --> 13:03.814
You had to tell us about... Then I wrestled in high school.

13:03.834 --> 13:05.716
I never did win the state championship.

13:05.776 --> 13:06.697
I got to the finals.

13:06.897 --> 13:10.641
Oh, did you really?

13:10.801 --> 13:11.362
In Iowa, 145.

13:12.623 --> 13:18.149
Then I went to Minnesota, and that was by pure stroke of luck.

13:18.169 --> 13:27.199
In 1933, after having stayed out from high school for a year to get a little money,

13:28.310 --> 13:44.361
The Iowa State Teachers Coach, where this professor, this high school principal had studied, came up to convince me that I should come to Iowa State Teachers College and he would get me a job for it.

13:44.780 --> 13:49.006
I don't remember what it was, working for my room or some such thing.

13:49.026 --> 13:54.254
He got interested in me because of wrestling and baseball.

13:54.274 --> 13:59.983
But there was none of this giving out money at that point.

14:00.003 --> 14:01.866
And I had about decided to do this.

14:02.447 --> 14:09.718
And this was because the year when I was out of high school, I competed in the Midwest AAU.

14:10.299 --> 14:13.183
Again, I went to the finals and was beaten by the

14:13.467 --> 14:21.096
guy at what's now Northern Iowa, then Iowa State teachers who won the thing, and I was just a high school kid.

14:21.116 --> 14:21.497
The same guy?

14:21.517 --> 14:22.278
He was a senior.

14:22.338 --> 14:24.200
He beat you twice the same day?

14:24.220 --> 14:25.401
No, this was a different guy.

14:25.421 --> 14:26.142
Oh.

14:26.162 --> 14:34.412
This was a high school or college senior, and I was not even a freshman.

14:35.473 --> 14:36.775
And so this coach

14:37.362 --> 14:43.427
He took a look at this and so he came up and convinced me I should come down there and he'd help me get a job.

14:43.447 --> 14:55.898
And I decided I was going to Iowa State teachers and I was going to become a high school science teacher and an athletic coach, high school athletic coach.

14:56.659 --> 14:59.901
I liked this combination.

14:59.921 --> 15:06.407
And about a week before, no, two weeks before I was to have gone,

15:06.674 --> 15:14.901
young guy by the name of George Champlin who'd graduated a year from the same high school, a year before I started, had gone to Minnesota.

15:15.081 --> 15:18.464
I knew his family and never knew him personally.

15:18.504 --> 15:25.591
His father had been a county auditor for a long time and they were a prominent, well-respected family.

15:25.611 --> 15:35.179
George happened to be a very fast little halfback and he had made a pretty big name for a 145 pounder

15:35.446 --> 15:40.234
at that time on Bernie Berman's teams because he didn't like little football players.

15:40.655 --> 15:42.037
This guy could really run.

15:43.419 --> 15:49.890
And he came one afternoon, he drove up out there and he said, he says, you don't know me but I know you.

15:50.771 --> 15:55.779
He says, come on get your things together and go with me to Minnesota tomorrow.

15:55.800 --> 15:57.943
I want you to look at the University of Minnesota.

16:01.062 --> 16:02.884
I said, well, I'm going to Iowa State teachers.

16:02.904 --> 16:05.527
He said, well, I got to go to early football practice tomorrow.

16:06.308 --> 16:07.149
He said, you come on up.

16:07.209 --> 16:08.991
If you don't like it, you can come back.

16:09.532 --> 16:10.393
You can come back.

16:11.193 --> 16:14.938
And so, hi.

16:15.538 --> 16:22.146
He convinced me, and I rode up with him, and he was all beat up, Model A, or whatever it was.

16:23.828 --> 16:29.314
And one of my other high school classmates rode along, who was also going to Iowa State teachers.

16:30.560 --> 16:33.624
And this guy, George Champlin, was a real operator.

16:33.644 --> 16:42.575
By the end of the day, he had us both had jobs in the university coffee shop working for our food, and he got us another job working for our room.

16:44.197 --> 16:57.833
And then, better than that even, since we were both little country boys, he had sort of a big room, and he moved us in with him for the first quarter.

16:58.741 --> 17:08.695
Well, we made the adjustment before he moved over to the fraternity house, so he was the guiding hand, and I owe him a great deal.

17:09.857 --> 17:15.946
Then there was the little problem about that the University of Minnesota probably didn't think I should be in the university in any case.

17:17.648 --> 17:25.339
In Iowa, to go to either Iowa State or Iowa State Teachers or University of Iowa,

17:25.690 --> 17:32.096
8th grade, we didn't have junior high schools in many of the small towns.

17:32.517 --> 17:35.360
We had high school, 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th.

17:35.920 --> 17:44.489
But in Minnesota at that time, junior high school, 9th grade didn't count as entrance requirements for the university.

17:47.312 --> 17:53.858
Although I had a good academic record, when I got to Minnesota and presented my credentials,

17:54.732 --> 18:00.218
So they said, well, you're deficient, whatever it was, four units freshman year.

18:00.879 --> 18:08.146
The only way you can get into the university is to take a special exam, which I did and proceeded to flunk it beautifully.

18:08.967 --> 18:14.953
And then there was the big discussion whether I should actually be in the university at all.

18:14.973 --> 18:18.737
What kind of special exam was it?

18:18.757 --> 18:21.460
One that was made up of a hell of a lot of vocabulary.

18:21.520 --> 18:23.102
I don't remember that.

18:23.386 --> 18:27.633
Words that I'd never heard a good share of, and you can imagine how I did.

18:27.653 --> 18:32.040
And besides, I was nervous when I knew that this was pretty decisive.

18:32.761 --> 18:39.732
And so I proceeded to flunk it beautifully, and then I was called in to the head of testing, who later became vice president of the university.

18:40.172 --> 18:40.873
And I saw him.

18:41.635 --> 18:50.288
As a matter of fact, he and his wife, and my wife and I were chaperones at the Forestry College of Agriculture.

18:52.664 --> 18:53.866
Thanksgiving dance.

18:54.707 --> 19:01.638
The day before I left or after I got my PhD to go to Dupont, I said, do you remember?

19:01.658 --> 19:04.503
I was the guy that wasn't supposed to succeed.

19:04.703 --> 19:06.826
Well, to make a long story short, going back.

19:08.910 --> 19:17.844
It so happened that they were in need of some white guinea pigs or experimental rats, educational rats.

19:18.645 --> 19:19.887
It was the first year

19:20.997 --> 19:32.354
that they were establishing what was called the General College on the main campus of the University of Minnesota, which would lead to Associate of Arts degree, which was a terminon degree for most.

19:32.374 --> 19:36.501
If you made an outstandingly good record, you could transfer to another college.

19:37.482 --> 19:39.465
And they needed some of these white rats.

19:39.485 --> 19:40.928
And so I was picked as one of them.

19:42.310 --> 19:49.080
That was, I think, in many ways, a stroke of luck because

19:49.634 --> 19:52.618
I went, of course, back behind with Champlin.

19:52.678 --> 19:56.723
He wasn't going to let me go back to Cresco and be a washout.

19:57.303 --> 19:59.126
And I couldn't go back out of pride.

20:00.067 --> 20:02.970
So I wasn't smart enough to get into the university.

20:02.990 --> 20:12.021
So I figured, well, I guess this is the least degrading, so I'd give it a try.

20:12.862 --> 20:17.548
But I had the good stroke of luck that my first advisor

20:18.136 --> 20:20.459
was the late Dr. Fred Hovde.

20:21.961 --> 20:22.963
How do you spell his name?

20:23.063 --> 20:29.592
H-O-V-D-E, who later became president of Purdue.

20:29.612 --> 20:34.960
This was his first job after he came back from Oxford, from Rhodes Scholarship.

20:36.822 --> 20:38.885
He was assistant dean.

20:38.905 --> 20:39.927
They called him director.

20:39.967 --> 20:43.131
They didn't even give General College deanship.

20:48.055 --> 20:49.717
He was named a Rhodes Scholar.

20:49.817 --> 20:53.121
He'd been a quarterback at Minnesota, a very good one.

20:53.141 --> 20:57.286
He was a good student, scholar, athlete.

20:57.306 --> 21:06.958
And I'm sure again, Chaplin was around the corner here talking to Hovde that this guy isn't as bad as that exam says he is.

21:08.260 --> 21:18.012
And so he looked at my record and he said, well, he said, I don't know why you've loused up this test this bad because it doesn't jive with your academic record in your high school.

21:19.088 --> 21:20.770
And he said, let's see what we can do about it.

21:20.910 --> 21:22.412
So he fixed out a program.

21:22.432 --> 21:28.280
He said, looks like you've got some blind spots, and we'll see what we can do about it.

21:28.360 --> 21:31.444
So I registered, and I did very well.

21:33.246 --> 21:38.352
The second semester, when I came in for the third semester, these were quarters.

21:38.372 --> 21:39.394
Yeah, still on quarters.

21:39.734 --> 21:43.959
And he said, you can transfer wherever you want to go.

21:43.979 --> 21:45.521
I said, I'd like to go to Forest Street.

21:45.541 --> 21:46.783
He picked up the telephone, and he said,

21:47.607 --> 21:50.150
I got a young man over here that liked to come to forestry.

21:50.171 --> 21:53.515
He's been here with me for two semesters or two quarters.

21:54.376 --> 21:58.302
And he said, I think that he's got the makings where you accept.

21:59.023 --> 22:05.892
So I started forestry and I graduated then.

22:06.072 --> 22:08.856
And I thought that

22:10.068 --> 22:14.873
I really was amazed when I saw on your veto that you went to Minnesota.

22:14.893 --> 22:17.215
And I thought it was for academic programs.

22:17.315 --> 22:18.977
And now I find out.

22:18.997 --> 22:20.939
It was George Champlin, this little.

22:21.439 --> 22:23.021
That was a buddy of yours.

22:23.661 --> 22:27.145
He was the guy that was the culpable, the responsible one.

22:27.325 --> 22:30.248
And he was a real maneuver.

22:30.829 --> 22:35.333
And you know, there's another sequel here that's kind of interesting.

22:38.097 --> 22:39.239
I carried a full load.

22:39.319 --> 22:41.021
I worked for my room and my board.

22:41.061 --> 22:45.628
That's where I went at the university coffee shop, where I met my wife to be.

22:46.329 --> 22:47.991
She was working her way through also.

22:49.213 --> 22:56.463
And then I was very successful.

22:56.744 --> 22:59.888
In those times, no one as freshmen could compete in athletics.

23:01.190 --> 23:06.197
But we used to have all university athletic

23:08.843 --> 23:09.945
I don't remember what they called it.

23:11.747 --> 23:13.029
All of the... Intermarrow?

23:13.089 --> 23:14.171
Intermarrow, yeah.

23:14.671 --> 23:16.875
Big carnival or whatever it was.

23:17.075 --> 23:18.036
All kinds of events.

23:19.398 --> 23:20.860
Both team and individual.

23:21.942 --> 23:23.985
Track and the whole gamut of things.

23:24.005 --> 23:26.869
Wrestling, boxing, and

23:27.440 --> 23:29.384
I was an experienced high school wrestler.

23:29.424 --> 23:32.049
This was before Minnesota had much wrestling.

23:32.169 --> 23:36.036
Only two teams competed, Rochester and Austin.

23:36.377 --> 23:47.338
This little town of Cresco used to really wipe the mats with them because they had poor coaching, even though they had big students.

23:48.010 --> 23:53.440
Unattached, I wrestled both my own weight, 145, and I wrestled a heavyweight.

23:53.760 --> 23:55.303
That was before there were any restrictions.

23:55.343 --> 23:57.607
You could wrestle two weights if you wanted.

23:58.810 --> 24:06.724
So I won both of these, including the heavyweight, against a great, big, burly football player.

24:06.744 --> 24:11.773
Simply because of knowledge and coaching.

24:12.023 --> 24:15.147
Then I competed in the Midwest AAU with one hit.

24:16.388 --> 24:17.610
Northwest, I guess it was.

24:18.631 --> 24:24.659
And then my second year, I guess I lost one meet against Illinois.

24:24.699 --> 24:32.008
I made a really pretty fantastic record because Minnesota was pretty damn poor in wrestling.

24:32.028 --> 24:40.258
About that time, the coach, who was really a banker, a lawyer, part-time coach, he did it for a hobby.

24:40.728 --> 25:07.191
was going to retire, so based on pretty largely on my record, and this other boy who'd come from the same high school, Upton, he also had a good record, not as good as mine, but the captain of our team says, when we went to the athletic director, the whole squad one morning after the season, and he said, we want to hire Dave Bartelma to fill the vacancy.

25:08.048 --> 25:13.656
Borlaug and Upton's high school coach and principal.

25:13.676 --> 25:21.006
Frank McCormick, the athletic director, used to be the baseball coach, he said, hell, we don't have any money to pay for this kind of person.

25:21.987 --> 25:32.321
And Clive Johnson, who was a big light heavyweight, pretty sharp, he was an ROTC officer, and he says, why don't you give it a try before you say you can't do it?

25:32.882 --> 25:36.427
To make a long story short, they hired him.

25:36.447 --> 25:37.448
And Dave Barthelma,

25:37.867 --> 25:45.840
Also, by then, just finished his PhD in psychology and education.

25:46.721 --> 25:49.205
That's the kind of guy he was.

25:49.225 --> 25:51.188
Pretty firm disciplinary.

25:51.909 --> 25:56.196
And he came up there and the first thing he

25:58.572 --> 26:09.044
Then he said, look, he said, this is a good sport for high school kids, which it is because 85-pounders the whole way up to compete.

26:09.064 --> 26:12.649
But he said Minnesota doesn't have any preparation.

26:12.669 --> 26:26.605
So he used to give this light heavyweight, the captain and I, two bus tickets to go to some parent-teacher's meeting halfway across the state and 35 cents for supper.

26:27.428 --> 26:33.376
We'd put on a demonstration of what they thought wrestling was, the slapstick pro stuff.

26:33.536 --> 26:41.426
And then we'd put on an amateur thing, get a couple of kids from the PT class, put on a demonstration, and it all took off.

26:42.387 --> 26:52.420
Before I left graduate school, I coached after I'd finished, a freshman also, and used to referee.

26:52.440 --> 26:54.583
By then, high school wrestling became

26:55.019 --> 26:56.281
big stuff in Minnesota.

26:56.301 --> 27:05.794
By the time I finished high school wrestling, I also refereed the first state tournaments and also the first district tournaments.

27:05.814 --> 27:07.156
And so I saw this all grow.

27:07.176 --> 27:22.917
And I guess in 71 or 72 when I was back there, which happened to coincide with the state tournament, high school tournament, they told me that there were more kids competing in wrestling than in any other sport except basketball in the state of Minnesota.

27:23.470 --> 27:25.072
So that's kind of interesting.

27:25.092 --> 27:26.795
Even more than football?

27:26.815 --> 27:29.439
Because small towns had wrestling.

27:29.459 --> 27:29.599
Right.

27:29.879 --> 27:32.303
They didn't have enough money for football.

27:32.363 --> 27:35.487
Exactly.

27:35.507 --> 27:42.357
Because it doesn't take much to put a wrestling team on the band.

27:42.858 --> 27:44.700
That's an interesting story.

27:44.720 --> 27:51.570
So I, in effect, was involved in hiring my high school

27:52.242 --> 27:52.722
coach.

27:53.704 --> 27:57.167
There wasn't any hiring, I mean, but that's the way it worked out.

27:58.388 --> 28:02.072
That's a good place to talk about last time that I'd like to continue.

28:02.713 --> 28:07.178
Today is, what is it today, the 12th?

28:07.798 --> 28:08.559
10th.

28:08.839 --> 28:14.865
10th of February, 1984, and we're in the second interview with Norman Borlaug.

28:16.147 --> 28:21.152
This is Terry Anderson, and while thinking over the interview,

28:21.554 --> 28:28.124
last time I came up with some questions that I'd like us to sort of backtrack on and then we'll get back to the University of Minnesota.

28:29.306 --> 28:38.480
One was, when you went to the University of Minnesota, you explained why you went to Minnesota.

28:38.981 --> 28:39.742
Like by accident.

28:39.842 --> 28:40.683
Yes.

28:40.703 --> 28:48.996
And when you did go there, did you ever think at that time that you would be going back to the family farm?

28:51.288 --> 29:12.553
Well, I guess there was no way of knowing, but things were so miserable during the 30s and the economic depression that I suppose, even though I can't recall precisely how I looked at it, I guess the fact that I went into forestry

29:13.462 --> 29:30.913
indicated that I wasn't very hopeful that the farming situation would be such that it would be attractive again on the small farm that we had.

29:31.535 --> 29:33.578
I can't recall any of the details.

29:33.878 --> 29:51.400
I always liked the farm, but the economic situations in the 30s were so miserable, I saw all the banks go broken, farmers lose their land, because if they had stock in the bank, they had double the indemnity.

29:52.139 --> 29:59.168
They would foreclose on the farms in order to raise enough money to pay off for that stock.

29:59.989 --> 30:14.707
And then I saw even worse, a year or two after that, sometimes all the personal property was sold from the sheriff's sale by those same families that had been well-to-do people and good farmers.

30:16.229 --> 30:17.750
So I guess this had a... So you were hopeful.

30:18.471 --> 30:21.555
I wasn't too optimistic at the time.

30:22.835 --> 30:51.357
And I would imagine that was one of the parts that was in aspects that was involved when I decided to have a try at forestry, because if I had wanted to hope that I could go ahead on the family farm, almost certainly I would have gone into agronomy or some aspect of applied agriculture.

30:51.607 --> 30:55.414
Okay, well that answers another question that I was going to ask you, too.

30:55.935 --> 31:03.268
Why a kid from a farm would want to go into forestry, and in other words, it was the impact of the Great Depression.

31:03.288 --> 31:06.574
Except for one other aspect.

31:06.594 --> 31:14.087
For example, on Sundays and holidays, I used to like to roam the woods.

31:14.438 --> 31:32.143
There were oak woods around this farm that I grew up on, some fairly sizable tracks that were all in family wood lots, but maybe 1,200-1,500 acres in one block, and so I used to roam these during the hunting season.

31:32.323 --> 31:33.865
I used to like to fish.

31:33.885 --> 31:40.935
There wasn't much fish in those small streams and rivers because they'd be killed out by the

31:41.540 --> 31:48.808
ice freezing every year, except in a few deeper holes.

31:48.828 --> 32:03.025
But I liked fishing and hunting, and I suppose this had, and I told you I ran a trap line, I believe, this used to appeal to me, just as being in the Alcar.

32:04.473 --> 32:05.994
There is another issue.

32:06.014 --> 32:15.563
You said that your grandfather was not in any farm organization, and you've alluded to the fact that during the Great Depression, a number of farms were collapsing.

32:16.664 --> 32:21.548
Did your father ever get involved during these really bad times on the farm?

32:21.568 --> 32:29.516
Did your father ever get involved in any of the farm organizations, which there were a number during the Great Depression, and a number of those were increasingly radical?

32:30.476 --> 32:32.218
No, he never did.

32:32.806 --> 32:40.954
And curiously enough, right around the county where we were located, there was no radical groups there.

32:41.515 --> 33:00.674
There was some pretty strong feelings towards, in that period, in the next county south, where the Collins Land and Mortgage Company came in and took over a lot of those farms that had been foreclosed on.

33:00.694 --> 33:02.796
With my understanding, recollection,

33:03.063 --> 33:24.177
that those farms were, the mortgages were held by one or more of the large insurance companies in the East, and when they went broke, they formed this subsidiary holding company, the Collins Land and Mortgage Company.

33:25.152 --> 33:31.423
They pulled up all the fences, started plowing it out to the edge of the roads, and there was strong resentment there.

33:31.985 --> 33:36.853
But apparently the markets went so bad that that was folded up.

33:37.655 --> 33:39.098
It never prospered.

33:40.079 --> 33:44.848
And as things began to pick up, apparently those farms were sold off.

33:47.258 --> 33:50.911
But that was the closest right around Howard County.

33:50.931 --> 33:55.227
This was mostly in Chickasaw, where this took place.

33:56.202 --> 34:02.171
that I noticed that there was pretty strong public feelings against this sort of anger.

34:02.432 --> 34:06.158
And it was directed toward some eastern establishment then?

34:06.238 --> 34:09.062
It wasn't directed toward any individuals in the community?

34:09.242 --> 34:09.583
No, no.

34:09.603 --> 34:14.030
But it was toward something that they couldn't get a handle on, something vague on.

34:14.070 --> 34:14.811
Hidden hand.

34:14.851 --> 34:15.833
Yeah, the hidden hand.

34:17.796 --> 34:19.979
The hidden hand of the free market, yeah.

34:19.999 --> 34:21.822
And so,

34:22.595 --> 34:35.693
and a little farther west, a couple of counties over, when things were at its worst, I did not see this personally, but my granddad used to talk about this.

34:38.423 --> 34:39.765
at some of those sheriff's sales.

34:40.387 --> 34:56.196
The second one, after the farms had been foreclosed on, but a year or two later, when the personal property was sold at sheriff's sale, the neighbors turned up with shotguns and pitchforks at those sheriff's sales.

34:56.446 --> 35:04.300
And they bought in that property and obviously turned it back to the owner for a pittance of what it was really worth.

35:04.640 --> 35:09.889
It wasn't healthy to bid against those people.

35:11.652 --> 35:17.182
So there were real strong feelings, but it didn't happen to be right around the community.

35:17.242 --> 35:18.184
I've forgotten the name.

35:18.324 --> 35:21.289
I have in the back of my mind the name of

35:21.674 --> 35:27.485
the town, but I think I would rather not put that on the tape because that's a long time back.

35:28.206 --> 35:31.853
But I do know that it was several counties west.

35:32.775 --> 35:34.218
Did you ever read the grapes of Ralph?

35:34.999 --> 35:35.961
Yes.

35:37.323 --> 35:40.870
Did you find any analogies in the grapes of Ralph?

35:41.451 --> 35:42.433
Yes, I think so.

35:42.683 --> 35:44.004
Well, what could you explain?

35:44.205 --> 35:48.069
But not to the same extent.

35:48.129 --> 35:51.472
I think it was worse than some of the settings that he picked for it.

35:51.612 --> 35:51.792
Yeah.

35:54.075 --> 35:58.740
The Oklahoma, the dust storm, all of this.

35:58.840 --> 36:04.185
We had the drought in 34, 35.

36:04.866 --> 36:10.632
Also, my grandfather told me that the drought of

36:11.860 --> 36:34.801
I suppose it was 35, was the closest to a crop failure that he had, I'm not sure it was 34 or 35, anyway, when it was at the university, was the closest he had seen to really complete a crop failure in that part of Iowa from the time he was a small boy.

36:35.902 --> 36:41.327
Oats were miserable, the hay was bad, and the corn was bad.

36:42.826 --> 36:43.527
Let me stop this.

36:44.568 --> 36:53.741
Did the Great Depression and the problems with the Great Depression, did that have an impact on your father's politics, his political views?

36:57.446 --> 36:58.508
No, I don't think so.

36:58.688 --> 37:12.647
I think that he, even though he did a great deal of reading about the world economic situation, especially the agricultural situation in the U.S.,

37:13.336 --> 37:31.395
He used to read the, among other farm papers, the Wallace Farmer and Henry Wallace, as you remember, became the Secretary of Agriculture under Roosevelt, and I have a feeling that, recalling

37:31.797 --> 37:42.232
those days that Dad was a strong supporter of Henry Wallace's philosophies, which was New Deal.

37:42.512 --> 37:53.468
Even though I'm sure that most often he voted Republican, he would vote for an individual also, candidate.

37:54.325 --> 37:56.127
Not necessarily a straight party.

37:56.487 --> 38:04.696
Right, so in other words, he might on local elections vote Republican, but on the national scene support Roosevelt usually?

38:04.716 --> 38:18.971
I think that in that case, he never did tell me, but I felt certain that he probably would voted for Roosevelt, at least in the first two goals.

38:19.211 --> 38:24.096
I had long since left with the East, so I don't know

38:25.358 --> 38:26.600
what he did later.

38:26.900 --> 38:34.050
We never talked to politics very much, except as it related to economics.

38:34.070 --> 38:37.135
Well, you could first vote in the election in 1936.

38:38.216 --> 38:38.897
Yes.

38:38.917 --> 38:40.980
And did you vote for Roosevelt?

38:41.000 --> 38:48.831
In 1936, I really hadn't had a residence long enough to be eligible to vote.

38:48.951 --> 38:51.776
I was working for the Forest Service, and I was out.

38:54.700 --> 38:54.960
Let's see.

38:56.476 --> 38:58.258
Yes, out in Massachusetts.

38:58.278 --> 39:08.011
I hadn't been there long enough or didn't get my papers in order, so I missed a chance to vote at that time.

39:08.032 --> 39:09.614
Would you have voted for Roosevelt?

39:09.654 --> 39:16.743
Yes, I think so, because I'd worked by that time, you see, in a lot of those emergency programs.

39:16.843 --> 39:20.548
For example, Civilian Conservation Corps.

39:20.568 --> 39:25.555
I was a NYA student, National Youth Administration student.

39:25.957 --> 39:31.564
And I'd never made it to the university if it hadn't been for that help.

39:31.584 --> 39:43.858
Okay, well, now that we're on that, let's go back to the university and let's talk about those Roosevelt policies and the impact that they had on your life.

39:43.878 --> 39:49.665
Can you explain how you got the National Youth Administration job and tell me what you did?

39:49.725 --> 39:51.087
Yes.

39:51.691 --> 39:59.041
You see, I had only about a hundred and fifty dollars or thereabouts when I started the university, but I did get two jobs.

39:59.161 --> 40:16.944
I worked for my board at a restaurant, and after that went broke, I was fortunate enough to, after a hell of a time for several months, to get a job in a sorority house, a waiter, working food.

40:18.086 --> 40:21.310
And then I

40:21.948 --> 40:28.498
had another job that I worked where I could scratch together about enough to pay for my room.

40:32.263 --> 40:48.647
That, as I recall, I used to park cars under the Northrop Auditorium at the concerts and the artist courses.

40:49.589 --> 40:50.470
That helped.

40:51.191 --> 40:59.179
It wasn't enough to pay for the room because it was only, as I recall, one night a week or something like that.

40:59.439 --> 41:00.240
Where'd you live?

41:00.480 --> 41:01.101
A rooming house?

41:01.121 --> 41:01.781
A rooming house.

41:02.182 --> 41:03.363
Do you remember where it was?

41:04.284 --> 41:09.749
Well, I moved around in southeast Minneapolis.

41:11.071 --> 41:15.495
I lived there all during my college career, undergraduate.

41:16.437 --> 41:18.881
The first one was in the Kearsarge Apartments.

41:19.542 --> 41:30.301
They were directly across on 15th, directly across from where the new athletic headquarters of the university is.

41:30.441 --> 41:32.204
There were three old brick buildings there.

41:33.186 --> 41:36.892
The new track facilities, the outside outdoor track facilities, yeah.

41:36.912 --> 41:41.280
And especially the administrative offices.

41:41.615 --> 41:50.389
where the athletic department has their administrative offices and they do have some gymnasium or some such thing there.

41:50.489 --> 41:52.553
Yeah, but they have a new baseball field there.

41:52.593 --> 41:53.915
Yeah, but it's... Berman field, isn't it?

41:54.035 --> 41:57.401
Yes, but I think it's... That's down in Louisiana.

41:57.421 --> 42:03.150
That was where I lived the first year and the second year

42:06.202 --> 42:15.255
15th, I believe, so this must have been on about 13th and about 7th or 8th.

42:15.676 --> 42:18.620
Yeah, I know where you were, because I lived in there too.

42:19.201 --> 42:32.040
And within a few blocks of there, all four years, the University coffee shop had disappeared by the time you arrived.

42:32.459 --> 42:40.752
It was on, what's the street, not University, 5th, where the main traffic comes from.

42:41.052 --> 42:41.613
Oh yeah, yeah.

42:41.733 --> 42:43.035
5th and about.

42:43.055 --> 42:44.357
Fourth.

42:44.838 --> 42:53.311
Fourth and about, let's see, 15th, 14th, between 13th and 14th.

42:53.331 --> 42:54.713
Yeah, where the theater is.

42:54.913 --> 42:56.796
Yeah, it's across the street.

42:56.962 --> 42:58.364
little farther up towards this.

42:58.384 --> 43:00.527
Dinkytown, did they call it Dinkytown?

43:00.547 --> 43:00.808
Dinkytown.

43:00.828 --> 43:03.431
We used to call it the Dinkyt Theater also.

43:03.892 --> 43:07.737
They did change the name to Varsity Theater or something like that.

43:07.757 --> 43:09.039
That's sophisticated.

43:09.059 --> 43:11.042
Yeah.

43:11.062 --> 43:17.832
There used to be a, well all of those places have disappeared, at least the names have changed.

43:18.172 --> 43:21.016
Some of the buildings I guess still look pretty much the same.

43:21.137 --> 43:24.201
And so,

43:24.552 --> 43:29.718
Let's get back then to the National Youth Administration and how you got that job.

43:29.738 --> 43:49.159
Well, I got, I had enough money to get registered for the second quarter, but I was without even Nichols.

43:50.590 --> 43:58.660
and somebody told me about this NYAA situation, so I went over and put in an application.

43:59.962 --> 44:01.323
There wasn't anything right then.

44:02.645 --> 44:07.691
Mrs. Johnson was her name, I've forgotten, Dorothy, I believe, Mrs. Dorothy Johnson.

44:07.711 --> 44:09.253
I saw her many years later.

44:09.293 --> 44:18.184
She came to Mexico once, and I took her out to the experimental station, but she

44:18.704 --> 44:30.978
told me, well, she's one of my great records in my background, and she said, there's nothing now.

44:31.819 --> 44:47.817
But I think right after that second semester, or quarter, some way or another, I survived, and I remember that before I got hooked up to the sorority house,

44:48.185 --> 45:17.280
after the university coffee shop went broke, there were weeks when we'd get the, all of us that worked there were in the same shape, I don't know, 15, 20 students, those little coupons for at the White Castle hamburgers place, and with one of those I think you could get three of those hamburgers

45:17.615 --> 45:19.598
for a dime or for 15 cents.

45:19.798 --> 45:21.300
I think three for a dime.

45:21.320 --> 45:31.894
There used to be a nickel apiece, and that and milk was the only damn thing I had for several weeks.

45:32.334 --> 45:35.659
Where was White Castle located then?

45:36.820 --> 45:44.871
The closest one was on University, right on the corner of University and Fourth.

45:45.572 --> 45:46.373
No kidding.

45:46.876 --> 45:48.218
It's no longer there.

45:48.238 --> 45:53.989
No, it's no longer there either, just across from the College of Education.

45:54.370 --> 45:58.237
Yeah, but now they have a McDonald's, so.

45:58.257 --> 45:58.758
Yeah.

45:58.778 --> 46:03.246
So, at the end of that quarter, and then I was really stuck.

46:04.989 --> 46:05.089
Yeah.

46:05.109 --> 46:06.492
I couldn't even pay my tuition.

46:06.512 --> 46:10.639
I went over to see Miss Johnson again, the administrator for it.
