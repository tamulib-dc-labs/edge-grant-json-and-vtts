WEBVTT

00:01.482 --> 00:02.743
Canals, right. I've never talked to him, but I'm 
going to next time I'm on the East Coast. Oh, you

00:05.687 --> 00:13.115
certainly should, because Johnny's got some 
interesting things to say, because, oh boy.

00:16.840 --> 00:18.161
My memory's failing me here. But he was in and out of 
Washington, I think, in uniform, I believe. Yes.

00:26.771 --> 00:27.832
In ONR and so on. And then... at Scripps and then 
went back to Rhode Island, but he's been very

00:32.347 --> 00:50.743
active in the kind of political aspects of these 
things and so on, and you certainly ought to have a

00:32.347 --> 00:50.743
talk with

00:32.347 --> 00:50.743
him. research vessels. Obviously, you don't have 
any when you come here. What do you do? How do you go

00:58.385 --> 00:59.186
about it? What kind do you try to choose? What do you 
want your undergraduates to have? Just tell me

01:03.010 --> 01:04.832
about it. Well, here we were influenced a good deal 
by also local tradition and so on. And when I

01:22.313 --> 01:46.526
arrived here in 51, the department under 
primarily under Dr. Barnes's I think impetus had

01:22.313 --> 01:46.526
obtained through sort of government surplus a 
small vessel that had been originally built by the

01:22.313 --> 01:46.526
Bureau of Commercial Fisheries. She was about 115 
feet long, wood hull, and had been designed not as a

01:51.760 --> 02:09.600
fishing vessel, but essentially as a small kind of 
passenger and freight vessel to take care of

01:51.760 --> 02:09.600
supplying fisheries

01:51.760 --> 02:09.600
programs up in Alaska and so on. She had an 
interesting sort of characteristic that she

02:10.087 --> 02:28.052
could, although she was a small vessel, she could 
accommodate quite a large number of passengers

02:10.087 --> 02:28.052
and had a large hold which in effect we were able to 
convert to a sort of laboratory. She was not didn't

02:30.067 --> 02:32.970
have a great deal of deck space and so on. But this 
vessel had been procured and it required a certain

02:33.670 --> 02:45.001
amount of conversion as they always do and also the 
installation of necessary winches and so on. We

02:45.782 --> 02:57.593
used this, what was in a sense a very small type 
vessel up until we obtained the the Thompson,

02:58.332 --> 03:06.541
which is one of these Agars, in about 1965 or 66. So 
we used Brown Bear for about 15 years, and not only

03:06.661 --> 03:28.204
for local work inside Puget Sound and so on and off 
the coast, but we took her out into the North

03:06.661 --> 03:28.204
Pacific, not, but she was range limited as well as 
sort of size limited, and so it was sort of the Gulf

03:28.825 --> 03:48.167
of Alaska and so on, but out along the Aleutian 
chain, and in 1964, and I'm sorry,

03:56.095 --> 04:07.849
must be 1959, 1960,

03:56.095 --> 04:07.849
we actually took her north up into the Bering Sea 
and actually into the Arctic. So we stretched her

04:07.869 --> 04:18.222
capabilities just about as much as and maybe 
beyond sort of reasonable limits, but she proved

04:19.163 --> 04:36.661
to be a very kind of efficient vessel in that she 
could be operated with a fairly small crew and so

04:19.163 --> 04:36.661
on, and we thought we got a lot of good work out of 
her. When she was replaced by the T.G. Thompson, we

04:41.926 --> 04:49.153
were clearly sort of vessel limited, but we ended 
up with a real sort of problem here in the fact that

04:57.537 --> 05:17.346
We were really rather reluctant to take on one of 
these AGARs, but had been told repeatedly by ONR

04:57.537 --> 05:17.346
and NSF that the vessel would be completely 
funded, because it was almost an ordered

04:57.537 --> 05:17.346
magnitude jump here in the cost of operations and 
so on. So we finally did. And of course, we no sooner

05:19.148 --> 05:23.815
had delivery of the ship than they said they 
couldn't.

05:26.140 --> 05:38.652
has really been fighting ever since to, in a sense, 
get adequate vessels, operation support for the

05:26.140 --> 05:38.652
vessel. And one thing we did not get involved in, 
and it was done intentionally,

05:53.343 --> 06:17.780
It may be hard to tell whether we were right or 
wrong, but we never got involved in anything like

05:53.343 --> 06:17.780
the Indian Ocean Expedition or even going back 
prior to that to the IGY of using this as a mechanism

05:53.343 --> 06:17.780
in a sense to expand the fleet and so on, which was 
clearly done, I think, at some of the

05:53.343 --> 06:17.780
institutions. They used these sort of major 
national efforts to increase the size of their

06:22.655 --> 06:52.290
fleet, but we've never felt we had quite the same, 
or I never felt, maybe I should say, and I know some

06:22.655 --> 06:52.290
of the faculty would agree with me, that we should 
try and do the same kind of things as Scripps and

06:22.655 --> 06:52.290
Woods Hole did, but we had our own destiny to try and 
work out here, which didn't necessarily involve

06:22.655 --> 06:52.290
the very extensive seagoing cruises. Did you 
expect all your undergraduates to work on the

06:53.063 --> 06:57.368
vessel out at sea? Oh,

06:58.450 --> 07:17.333
I think I would have said yes if you go back to the 
early 50s or something, but

06:58.450 --> 07:17.333
we got very much caught up with this. the Sputnik 
era here, with increased interest in science and

07:18.967 --> 07:27.078
so on. And certainly the ocean became a very 
romantic sort of an area of study. And so our

07:41.107 --> 07:47.595
undergraduate program shot up at a rate that I 
don't think we would ever have sort of predicted.

07:48.677 --> 07:58.850
And we were, our undergraduate enrollment in 
oceanography was increasing about 25 percent a

07:48.677 --> 07:58.850
year, which means it doubled every three years. 
And we went from one student or something in 1952,

07:59.651 --> 08:10.405
and we were up to I think over 800 in,

08:11.077 --> 08:20.527
well, the early 60s, I guess it was. And, I mean, it 
was clearly obvious you couldn't do the kind of

08:23.090 --> 08:38.367
things that we'd originally had in mind, which, as 
I think I mentioned earlier, a really sort of

08:23.090 --> 08:38.367
practical preparation of sea work and so forth. 
And it got to a point that we couldn't even give

08:39.089 --> 08:53.241
laboratories

08:39.089 --> 08:53.241
with our formal courses because we didn't have the 
capacity to handle this number of students. So

08:53.341 --> 09:01.729
even the kind of laboratory work clearly sort of 
suffered under this expansion. It was very

09:02.690 --> 09:08.995
exciting, but

09:02.690 --> 09:08.995
I think probably went too far. Now, I don't know 
what the later, what's happening in the last year

09:10.405 --> 09:32.955
or two, but it's dropped down considerably, the 
undergraduate enrollment, but it in a sense got

09:10.405 --> 09:32.955
over-inflated here, but not really due to our 
recruiting efforts or anything, but just because

09:10.405 --> 09:32.955
of general popular interest in the field. And 
we've done a lot of things other than just the sort

09:32.975 --> 09:38.863
of formal undergraduate

09:39.029 --> 10:01.585
and graduate training here, in that

09:39.029 --> 10:01.585
it started back in the days where I really felt we 
did need to provide some input of students and so

09:39.029 --> 10:01.585
on, which involved working with high school 
teachers and so on. I ran summer institutes for for

10:04.898 --> 10:14.391
high school teachers for a number of years here, 
with the idea that, you know, they'd encourage

10:04.898 --> 10:14.391
some of their students to come into the field. I've 
been involved in the writing of two high school

10:15.213 --> 10:32.577
level textbooks, and so we did that, and one of the 
things which had started before the war was a

10:33.350 --> 10:54.630
general sort of introductory oceanography 
course, which still carries the number of

10:33.350 --> 10:54.630
Oceanography 101, which was in no way intended for 
our own majors, but a science orientation course.

10:54.970 --> 11:02.817
And most of the students who take it are not even 
science students, but humanities and social

10:54.970 --> 11:02.817
science students. We were teaching, that's a 
five-credit course, and a few years ago at least,

11:03.455 --> 11:12.330
we were teaching that to over 1,500 students a 
year. We build up, certainly. I must have some sort

11:18.099 --> 11:22.847
of general public awareness of the field, at 
least. And I think these are, these are worthwhile

11:28.890 --> 11:32.154
things. They're not just for sort of promotional, 
but anybody living around here, I think, ought to

11:32.174 --> 11:42.386
know a little bit about what the ocean is like. And 
so that's still going on. When you started to

11:49.253 --> 11:53.158
outfit these early vessels, did you have a 
professional captain do so? Something like James

11:53.418 --> 11:56.902
Fawn, I'm thinking of, or did you try to do it within 
your department? No, we started out in a sort of

11:57.623 --> 12:17.286
small way here, and the first man we had who was 
skipper of, he'd been a skipper of an even smaller

11:57.623 --> 12:17.286
vessel before the Brown Bear, had no sort of formal 
training as an officer. He had been a fisherman

12:20.206 --> 12:31.905
primarily, and a small boat operator type person, 
and came in and kind of learned the job as he went

12:20.206 --> 12:31.905
along. He was a marvelous individual, and Frank 
Princehouse, and very much interested in the in

12:43.338 --> 13:12.636
the what we were trying to do and extremely 
cooperative and very good at sort of taking care of

12:43.338 --> 13:12.636
the vessel and the crew and so on we actually had to 
see that he got the opportunity to get some sort of

12:43.338 --> 13:12.636
special training and so on when the Thompson came 
along because otherwise he couldn't have been

12:43.338 --> 13:12.636
captain on the Thompson unfortunately he shortly 
after we got the Thompson he developed a serious

13:13.628 --> 13:19.978
ailment and since died, but he was captain on her 
for about a year or so. And then we went to these

13:20.038 --> 13:35.621
Morris out of professionally trained officers, 
and I think the man that's captain now is the

13:20.038 --> 13:35.621
Thompson that came to us from Scripps, having been 
on one of their ships. So there's been a switch

13:35.641 --> 13:38.826
there, but it's partly related, again, just to the 
size of the vessels and the kind of Coast Guard

13:39.532 --> 13:50.824
regulations about the types of officers that you 
have to have on board.

13:52.205 --> 13:59.756
When you first come to Washington, the funding for 
oceanography and oceanographic departments was

13:52.205 --> 13:59.756
sort of a block funding. That is that- When I came 
out here. When you came out here. Yes. Is that ONR

14:03.641 --> 14:10.972
and so forth would get sort of a block funding to a 
university, which has moved recently to sort of

14:03.641 --> 14:10.972
special project fundings. What sort of feeling do 
you have about that as it affects the way you try to

14:10.992 --> 14:14.837
work your department? Well, of course, I've been 
out of this for about ten years. I just think it's

14:21.314 --> 14:37.418
been a very unfortunate sort of trend, and I keep 
hoping I can see some sign that's going to reverse

14:21.314 --> 14:37.418
itself, but I don't think I have been able to see 
anything so far. Yes, although in a sense, in terms

14:39.942 --> 14:50.578
of the total dollars, they were small now compared 
to what's being

14:52.448 --> 14:53.692
transferred these days. Nevertheless, they were 
relatively large amounts, and in the first few

14:54.333 --> 15:06.188
years when essentially all our support came from 
ONR, it almost used to be done by letter. they'd

15:06.758 --> 15:09.903
send us a letter saying, what do you want to do? And 
we'd write a letter back saying, we think it'd be

15:10.063 --> 15:13.167
fun to do so. And they'd say, well, we think we can 
give you X thousand dollars next year. And why

15:17.574 --> 15:20.358
don't you write a request for that? And we'd write 
another letter saying, we'd like to have so much

15:20.398 --> 15:23.763
for next year. And that was it. But since then, it 
has gone progressively towards more agencies

15:26.887 --> 15:35.500
involved, which in a way, is life insurance, I 
think, from our point of view, because not all of

15:36.577 --> 15:44.935
them go up and down at the same time. So it gives you 
some sort of security in that way. But the fact that

15:50.007 --> 15:54.737
the projects have and down and down until you get 
the situation which I feel prevails today where

15:56.135 --> 16:18.632
money is not allocated really to, although 
legally it comes to the university and to the

15:56.135 --> 16:18.632
department, it's based on these individual sort 
of proposals. and what people do is start talking

16:18.916 --> 16:26.467
about my money and my ship time and so forth.

16:30.713 --> 16:46.155
I think that from an administrative point of view, 
it's essentially an intolerable situation and

16:30.713 --> 16:46.155
that the chairman of the department has no way of 
administering All he's doing is trying to fit

16:46.675 --> 17:04.395
together all these little bits and pieces, and he 
has no way of fitting things together in most

16:46.675 --> 17:04.395
cases, and saying, okay, you two fellows get 
together and use the ship jointly or something.

17:04.436 --> 17:07.159
They both say, well, I got my money to do so-and-so. 
And it's completely sort of ridiculous. I think

17:11.984 --> 17:15.248
it's a part of sort of Parkinson's law here that 
that this is the way in which a bureaucracy

17:15.582 --> 17:19.909
functions. It tends to generate work for itself, 
and this is exactly what I can see is happening in

17:20.050 --> 17:39.362
Washington, that if you can have 100 projects 
under your guidance rather than 10, you've got

17:20.050 --> 17:39.362
that much more paper and you justify the many more 
positions and so on. But this, plus the fact that

17:40.102 --> 18:01.816
there are many, many more sort of bookkeeping 
requirements these days than there used to be,

17:40.102 --> 18:01.816
really makes it a major sort of problem, I think, 
from the administrative point of view, to do these

17:40.102 --> 18:01.816
things. The problem, I think, is sort of being 
compounded recently by the fact that they've got

18:07.557 --> 18:15.629
into this multi-institutional

18:07.557 --> 18:15.629
pattern here. And I haven't had any direct part of 
any of these things, but I don't know how they

18:16.130 --> 18:28.890
managed to do those things and keep them going. But 
even the Sea Grant program was originally thought

18:29.933 --> 18:50.382
of as a sort of block funding type thing, and even 
there they, without any kind of appropriate

18:29.933 --> 18:50.382
authorization from Congress or anything, they 
went off in the same direction of breaking things

18:29.933 --> 18:50.382
down into ridiculously small things. And there's 
all the paperwork involved with this, as well as

18:51.043 --> 18:56.751
the lack of flexibility. The other thing that's 
been happening here is the fact that you're

18:59.038 --> 19:13.616
committed to making plans longer and longer in 
advance that you want any kind of major support

18:59.038 --> 19:13.616
these days. You've probably got a plan about three 
years ahead and hard to get it. The result is by the

19:19.264 --> 19:21.186
time this third year's rolled around, you have 
absolutely no flexibility. As things have

19:25.201 --> 19:30.847
changed or something, you're kind of stuck with 
things. So, the planning's fine, but it

19:31.727 --> 19:43.439
certainly, you lose any kind of choice in things.

19:44.420 --> 19:45.942
A lot of the problems that have come from the 
combination of inflation and reduced funding and

19:47.322 --> 20:00.854
so on, all have really been most critical since I 
stepped aside as chairman of the department. And I

20:01.315 --> 20:14.747
thought I was leaving everything and looked rosy 
at the time that I decided that I would step down as

20:01.315 --> 20:14.747
chairman. And I couldn't, in a sense, I probably 
couldn't have chosen a better time. But I

20:20.141 --> 20:27.135
certainly had no anticipation of what was going to 
happen. What about the division of agencies,

20:28.277 --> 20:30.942
which you mentioned earlier? Let me sketch 
something for you. ONR becomes more

20:34.859 --> 20:51.180
mission-oriented as it advances upward after 
World War II, let's say particularly after 1949,

20:34.859 --> 20:51.180
and you begin to have the rise of NSF and other 
scientific agencies to administer

20:34.859 --> 20:51.180
oceanography. Was this essentially a good thing?

21:04.778 --> 21:12.565
I think it was for probably many different sort of 
reasons. But ONR was obviously strictly a Navy

21:12.585 --> 21:29.900
type thing, although in the early days they 
certainly interpreted their responsibilities

21:12.585 --> 21:29.900
very broadly, I think, relatively speaking. But 
there were areas that they were sort of not

21:29.940 --> 21:33.503
touching at all. But essentially, at least my 
interpretation is that sort of out of the ONR model

21:34.225 --> 21:43.581
came this idea for NSF. And NSF was set up, as I 
recall, in 1951. Let's see, the first director was

21:48.529 --> 21:57.885
moved over from ONR, remember, wasn't it? 
Waterman.

22:01.394 --> 22:10.187
But the general situation was that ONR would 
continue to support oceanography. NSF would get

22:10.427 --> 22:14.213
into, essentially, other fields. And NSF really 
didn't get into oceanography to any, I think I'm

22:15.315 --> 22:30.557
right in saying, any kind of significant extent 
until the IGYK program came along, which was

22:15.315 --> 22:30.557
actually in what was it, 57, 58, but where the 
funding must have predated that by a year or so. And

22:38.617 --> 22:45.447
I think NSF picked that up because, well, it was not 
just oceanography. There were many other

22:45.487 --> 23:00.527
aspects, but it would not have been appropriate 
for ONR to have gone into all of these other fields

22:45.487 --> 23:00.527
besides oceanography, certainly some of them. So 
this is really what moved NSF into the picture, and

23:01.047 --> 23:08.298
they've essentially never been out of it since. 
And the

23:09.500 --> 23:25.384
sort of drift of things has been such that we've 
been told various times, well, NSF's going to pick

23:09.500 --> 23:25.384
up more and more of this.

23:26.360 --> 23:28.550
I don't know quite what has happened. ONR seemed to 
be sort of going down in level of support as far as

23:28.570 --> 23:35.222
they were concerned here. But now I hear that maybe 
they're coming up again and so on. What has been

23:40.370 --> 24:02.222
difficult is for us, and we're not alone in this, is 
how do you sort of deal with ONR, NSF, AEC, which no

23:40.370 --> 24:02.222
longer exists under that name, but how do you keep 
some sort of a... of balance or whatever with these

24:03.097 --> 24:06.723
different agencies. And very often, I feel that we 
have been in the position of kind of divide and

24:06.983 --> 24:29.020
conquer, that where all the money and so forth 
existed in Washington, they were the ones who got

24:06.983 --> 24:29.020
together and decided, well, we'll support this 
institution to such and such a level. We're put in

24:29.607 --> 24:37.240
the position of asking people for, in a sense, 
overlapping kind of support. I don't think this is

24:37.320 --> 24:39.003
actually done. But I mean, you never know quite 
what's going to come out of these things. So I think

24:44.512 --> 24:50.502
it's been kind of a scary game here.

24:51.325 --> 25:08.188
AEC turned out to be a fairly substantial 
supporter for our work here, and entirely on sort

24:51.325 --> 25:08.188
of environmental studies, although they were 
related to essentially radioactive materials

24:51.325 --> 25:08.188
that might get into the Columbia River and so on. So 
that was of concern to them, but they were a kind of

25:09.870 --> 25:15.358
major supporter here. It seems almost to an 
outsider that it's as if oceanographers looked at

25:15.625 --> 25:28.959
what the government wanted and planned a research 
topic they might get funded, rather than moving

25:15.625 --> 25:28.959
out and directing research to what interested 
them. Is that a...? I think so, and of course

25:31.141 --> 25:41.532
there's always the kind of argument here about 
freedom of research and so forth, And I think all of

25:42.187 --> 25:59.672
the agencies have made

25:42.187 --> 25:59.672
quite a conscious effort to play fair on this 
thing, but the fact is that they do influence you a

26:00.091 --> 26:08.360
good deal, not by telling you what to do, but by 
refusing to support things that they didn't want

26:00.091 --> 26:08.360
to do. So things do become very much sort of 
controlled in this way, and exceedingly

26:08.440 --> 26:29.322
difficult to get sort of new things started, and 
particularly to get sort of younger men started

26:08.440 --> 26:29.322
and so on here.

26:29.960 --> 26:45.941
So I think that it reached a point where there was a 
sort of undesirable

26:29.960 --> 26:45.941
amount of control over what goes on. Sure, you do 
things where the money is. Now, we've chosen in a

26:48.865 --> 26:52.930
few cases not to go where the money was. We didn't 
participate at all in this Indian Ocean

26:53.146 --> 26:59.498
expedition by choice. We were asked at one time if 
we wanted to get involved in a lot of the Antarctic

27:00.059 --> 27:11.762
operations and we said no thank you, we didn't want 
to.

27:12.113 --> 27:32.603
I guess here have operated a little bit more on a 
sort of an individual basis and have not

27:12.113 --> 27:32.603
participated maybe as much in some of these 
multi-institutional programs that have been

27:12.113 --> 27:32.603
coming along here in recent years. Some of the 
individuals have. They've participated and gone

27:34.894 --> 27:37.536
on and so on. Now, we did get quite involved here for 
several years as part of the international,

27:37.556 --> 27:52.791
what's it called, international biological 
program on this upwelling program. But we've more

27:55.133 --> 28:01.999
or less operated

27:55.133 --> 28:01.999
more by ourselves. Is this because of the 
undergraduate emphasis here? No, I don't think

28:07.518 --> 28:32.492
one could say that, although the

28:07.518 --> 28:32.492
good many of the faculty are involved in teaching 
either at undergraduate or graduate level, which

28:07.518 --> 28:32.492
means that they're not entirely free to go off for 
long periods without making appropriate sort of

28:32.962 --> 28:35.405
adjustments and reallocations.

28:37.748 --> 28:43.556
No, I think it's more sort of individual choices. I 
may be overemphasizing this in a way, but one

28:44.117 --> 29:02.682
thing that I sort of fought against for a number of 
years was getting involved in general

29:04.670 --> 29:26.389
set of marine geophysics is refraction and 
reflection, seismic shooting and so on, which

29:04.670 --> 29:26.389
involved carrying explosives and was in a sense 
kind of hazardous thing. And I said, I didn't think

29:26.409 --> 29:29.071
we ought to get into that. There were two or three 
institutions that were heavily involved in it.

29:32.474 --> 29:34.356
Why did we have to get into it? Well, lo and behold, 
some money came along, and we were doing it. And we

29:41.598 --> 29:45.483
no sooner got started on it than ONR cut off the 
support. So we were probably being well advised,

29:45.543 --> 29:52.513
you know, never to get really sort of committed to 
that thing. And I think there have been some,

29:55.077 --> 30:03.769
probably some similar sort of things.

30:09.335 --> 30:29.408
So it's,

30:09.335 --> 30:29.408
I think if one took a really sort of objective view 
of things, one would find that the

30:09.335 --> 30:29.408
programs in this country are pretty much sort of 
what the federal government agencies want them to

30:09.335 --> 30:29.408
be. There's very little sort of independence here 
now. they can always turn around and say that

30:34.192 --> 30:49.868
anybody who wants to can submit a proposal on 
anything they think they want to do, and that if

30:34.192 --> 30:49.868
something isn't going on, it's because nobody's 
interested in doing the work, so they kind of stuck

30:34.192 --> 30:49.868
on this. But I, just as for fun here several years 
ago, I dreamed up a rhetorical question. I asked

31:03.098 --> 31:06.842
Professor Rattray whether I could have the 
Thompson for a couple of weeks. And he said, what do

31:06.862 --> 31:08.564
you want the Thompson for? And I said, oh, I'm not 
going to tell you, but I got an idea that I want to

31:08.584 --> 31:13.690
test. Can I have the ship for a couple of weeks? And 
he thought for a while, and he said, well, he

31:16.834 --> 31:21.859
guessed I could. It would require some 
telephoning to Washington to get some funds

31:21.899 --> 31:27.486
reallocated and so on. But if I really had a good 
thing, I could probably get the ship. And I said,

31:30.609 --> 31:32.211
what about some people help me?" And he said, oh, 
no, no people. Everybody's committed, you see, to

31:36.454 --> 31:41.421
other programs. So I had, this was just a 
hypothetical question, but it indicates how tied

31:41.441 --> 31:52.317
up you are with the system in a way. We had a uh we've 
mentioned it at lunchtime here we had this drought

31:53.707 --> 32:04.375
situation this year and it was more than just a 
local drought something very unusual has been

31:53.707 --> 32:04.375
happening out in the north
