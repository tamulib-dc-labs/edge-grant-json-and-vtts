WEBVTT

00:03.473 --> 00:07.919
Gordon Volkman was one of these people.

00:11.323 --> 00:26.243
We were interested in the fact that reflectivity 
from the bottom is going to be disturbed by the

00:11.323 --> 00:26.243
shape of the bottom. And it became apparent that If 
the bottom was sloped, the reflections from the

00:31.334 --> 00:38.703
bottom would appear to come in from a different 
direction. Also, if one was looking down the ridge

00:40.225 --> 00:48.976
of a mountain range, one would be in a shadow zone 
for bottom reflected sound. If one was looking

00:49.056 --> 00:57.747
down a valley, one would be in a sound channel from 
the standpoint of reflected sound.

00:58.503 --> 01:21.912
simple result of this kind of thinking, which 
wasn't really very fundamental thinking, but it

00:58.503 --> 01:21.912
was important to start thinking this way, was that 
every spot on the ocean has its own directivity

00:58.503 --> 01:21.912
index

00:58.503 --> 01:21.912
for bottom reflected sound, so that both the 
intensities and directions could change a great

00:58.503 --> 01:21.912
deal upon the bottom configuration.

01:29.671 --> 01:58.463
Also, another aspect of underwater sound, in 
which a great deal of field work was done, both with

01:29.671 --> 01:58.463
the standpoint of research work and also with the 
possibility of working with aviators, was that it

01:29.671 --> 01:58.463
quickly appeared one one night that if the source 
was at the bottom, near the bottom of the ocean, in

01:59.641 --> 02:25.716
fact, if it was at a depth in which, if the water was 
deep and it was at a depth at which the sound

01:59.641 --> 02:25.716
velocity equaled the velocity near the surface, 
that about 20 miles, 15 to 20 miles away, there

01:59.641 --> 02:25.716
would be a very strong convergence zone. And what 
was at least as important was that at all ranges out

02:28.261 --> 02:41.978
to that range,

02:28.261 --> 02:41.978
near-surface targets would be in the direct path. 
So this was called the Reliable Acoustic Path.

02:49.588 --> 02:58.099
Actually, it was the Naval Research Laboratory 
people who gave it that name and did some excellent

02:49.588 --> 02:58.099
work on it. But this was sort of a new concept in our 
game. It opened up the possibility of having

03:03.995 --> 03:10.785
much deeper towed sonar. It had the possibility of 
instrumentation, bottom mounted

03:11.626 --> 03:22.341
instrumentation, in which we could listen to it. 
If we were in deep water, we could listen to it out to

03:22.722 --> 03:27.529
a range of 20 miles. out to a range of 10 miles, it 
would get weaker and weaker, and then it would

03:28.353 --> 03:33.461
start getting stronger and stronger. So this 
opened up

03:34.002 --> 03:42.134
the range of things that could be done 
acoustically in the ocean a great deal. It was

03:43.616 --> 03:52.690
another step in showing that if one was willing to 
be more special purpose in the way one utilized

03:43.616 --> 03:52.690
acoustics, then the ocean was a more benign place 
than was usually given credit for. Let's shut it

03:58.320 --> 04:06.090
off a

03:58.320 --> 04:06.090
minute. Next, I would like to talk a little bit more 
about the research ships and submersibles. As

04:18.027 --> 04:21.732
mentioned earlier, transportation is an 
extremely important part of oceanography. And

04:26.757 --> 04:35.873
even after you get there, if the equipment isn't 
good enough so that you can operate, you sort of

04:26.757 --> 04:35.873
lost the purpose, lost the advantage of being 
where you are.

04:38.878 --> 04:42.764
There were two tacks on this. I decided this was 
important enough to spend a good deal of time on it.

04:48.290 --> 04:56.720
my bosses, both Hersey and Islin, and during much 
of this time, Admiral Smith was director. I

04:58.181 --> 05:01.525
started spending more time on it in two veins. One, 
a group of oceanographers,

05:02.446 --> 05:17.503
primarily under the sponsorship of ONR and with 
their well wishes, etc., we set about to... try and

05:19.154 --> 05:21.076
get some new ships designed. This went on over a 
good many years, but it ended up in the Agor class,

05:22.538 --> 05:37.333
about 180-foot ships, of which the Conrad was the 
first, and which Lamont received that ship. And

05:38.334 --> 05:46.663
this gave them a dual ship capability, because 
they had the Vima and the Conrad.

05:48.095 --> 05:50.818
The Conrad had all sorts of problems in the 
beginning. The

05:50.858 --> 06:00.787
Lamont wanted to operate it themselves rather 
than running a chance of a Union crew. There

06:00.807 --> 06:15.942
was a gas turbine on auxiliary power, which was a 
little bit too new to be very reliable.

06:16.107 --> 06:23.575
A good deal of discussion is whether it was 
incompetence on the part of the user or

06:16.107 --> 06:23.575
incompetence on the part of the builder or 
incompetence on the part of the specs. But finally

06:24.676 --> 06:36.549
the ship got out of the shipyard, and Lamont got it 
home and put it to work and altered some of the

06:24.676 --> 06:36.549
equipment, and it has been a very fine ship since. 
Along parallel with this, program of getting new

06:40.373 --> 06:46.523
ships was getting some ships to keep going in the 
game. At this stage, I want to pay particular

06:47.485 --> 07:04.272
homage to Commander Charlie Bishop, who was in 
ONR, in the Undersea Warfare Section, who did a

06:47.485 --> 07:04.272
marvelous job, as a fellow named Bill Groverman 
had done before him, Both of these people had a

07:04.943 --> 07:10.831
civilian compatriot called J.W. Smith, or James 
Smith, who was one of the better organizers and in a

07:10.871 --> 07:20.786
quiet way was one of the visionary people in 
oceanography. I think plate tectonics and a great

07:22.067 --> 07:33.043
many things in oceanography have much to be said 
for these people because they made it possible for

07:22.067 --> 07:33.043
American oceanography to go global. in a 
large-scale sense. At this time, Frosch had

07:37.587 --> 07:44.456
become director at Hudson Laboratories. And in my 
own case, I set out to try and find what ships that

07:45.898 --> 07:53.769
were in the reserve fleets would be available. We

07:55.150 --> 08:02.220
or I, I was doing most of the legwork. Checking was a 
great many people, both within the Navy, Maritime

08:03.095 --> 08:09.324
Administration, and amongst the laboratories. 
We settled down to about four ships, one of which

08:10.606 --> 08:28.393
was the Army FS class, about 180 footer, which 
subsequently, these were obtained by University

08:10.606 --> 08:28.393
of Rhode Island. by Scripps, by the University of 
Oregon, and several other organizations got

08:29.116 --> 08:37.425
these as research ships. At Woods Hole, we felt one 
of those would make an excellent replacement for

08:38.486 --> 08:53.942
the Atlantis, but it was not capable enough to take 
on the kind of work that some of us visualized ought

08:38.486 --> 08:53.942
to be done.

08:58.242 --> 09:13.557
The Navy fleet tug, which was about 200 feet long, 
had to do about 14 knots and was big and tough, was

08:58.242 --> 09:13.557
also a fine ship and available in supply. But

09:13.597 --> 09:26.410
the working spaces on it would have required a 
great deal of conversion in order to make them so it

09:13.597 --> 09:26.410
had a logical layout for our work. Also, it was a 
single screw ship, and we felt for

09:26.761 --> 09:32.827
maneuverability purposes we should have it. The 
Maritime Administration had a V-4 tug, which

09:32.847 --> 09:50.805
looked very good, but there was very little

09:32.847 --> 09:50.805
high seas work in which we could find people who had 
operated them enough to know how good seaboats

09:32.847 --> 09:50.805
they were. So we really settled on the on the Navy's 
salvage ships, the ARSs.

10:03.381 --> 10:12.836
Actually, the decision on my own part was made on 
New Year's Eve of 1956 or 57. And after looking at

10:14.138 --> 10:20.308
some other ships, I stopped off in Norfolk to take 
another look at this ARS class and to All the boys

10:21.419 --> 10:30.888
out in the salvage department of the Navy were 
having a New Year's party, and obviously they felt

10:21.419 --> 10:30.888
their ship was the best. And having ridden on 
nearly all of these ships myself, I couldn't help

10:30.968 --> 10:34.852
but agree with them. And even though it was more 
complicated than we wanted and so big it kind of

10:34.872 --> 10:43.580
frightened us, we decided that was the ship to lay 
our money on. The primary criteria some of us kept

10:43.620 --> 10:50.667
asking ourselves was if you had a job of operating 
off Iceland or circling it in the wintertime,

10:51.355 --> 10:58.485
which of these ships would you choose? This 
appeared to be the toughest, best-riding ship

10:59.867 --> 11:11.985
that was available in the reserve fleet in a size 
that was small enough so that our bosses would

10:59.867 --> 11:11.985
consider taking it. This was extremely important 
because none of the oceanographic institutions

11:12.005 --> 11:20.637
wanted to take, the private labs wanted to take on a 
ship that was too big. Well, anyhow, J.W. Smith and

11:25.438 --> 11:49.948
Charlie Bishop in O&R risked about 30% of their 
next year's budget, which they hadn't received

11:25.438 --> 11:49.948
yet and committed it, on getting the Argo for 
Scripps, the chain for Woods Hole, and a still

11:25.438 --> 11:49.948
bigger AVP ship for Bob Frosh at Hudson 
Laboratories.

11:53.540 --> 11:58.364
of particular interest here and to show the 
versatility of the Navy group.

12:01.808 --> 12:22.146
Woods Hole, Island would not accept a ship of this 
size, so the Navy made the, at our request, at our

12:01.808 --> 12:22.146
unofficial request, made the conversion, crewed 
it for one year at the end of which time Woods Hole

12:01.808 --> 12:22.146
could either take it over themselves or have the 
MSTS crew continue. Scripps, on the other hand,

12:26.164 --> 12:31.971
Revell wanted to have nothing to do with the Navy in 
any part of it. He just wanted enough money to have

12:31.991 --> 12:39.540
every aspect of the conversion handled by Scripps 
and to have a Scripps crew.

12:43.746 --> 12:48.792
Bob Frosch at Hudson Laboratories took exactly 
the opposite view there. He wanted to have their

12:49.244 --> 12:57.116
laboratory have no responsibility, really, for 
the conversion or for the operation of the ship.

12:58.739 --> 13:07.192
And ONR and their people saw to it that all three 
requirements were met. This was a piece of

13:08.253 --> 13:15.184
administrative flexibility which is seldom 
seen, but it was certainly appreciated. These

13:17.088 --> 13:35.177
ships were, as I'd said before, the ones that 
really permitted the ocean-wide cruises

13:17.088 --> 13:35.177
with large enough groups of people and enough 
equipment to pretty much take on whatever problem

13:17.088 --> 13:35.177
one wanted to take on.

13:39.083 --> 13:41.847
We were very fortunate in the Office of Naval 
Research, that Charlie Bishop, who was a

13:42.080 --> 14:07.075
submarine man, was followed by Commander Swede 
Momsen, who was also a submarine man, and

13:42.080 --> 14:07.075
felt that submersibles made good sense for 
science and good sense for the Navy to be involved

13:42.080 --> 14:07.075
with. Not many people in oceanography seem to feel 
that submersibles made very good sense. The

14:17.351 --> 14:33.417
Navy's work with Trieste was such that some marine 
biology and a tiny little bit of physical

14:17.351 --> 14:33.417
oceanography had been done out of San Diego. But 
they were not really, in any sense of the word, were

14:34.308 --> 14:39.254
they workhorses of oceanography.

14:41.676 --> 15:00.838
Cousteau, with his submersible, with his ship 
Calypso and his submersible Surcouf, had devised

14:41.676 --> 15:00.838
a submersible which was easy to use, was 
rationally designed to be operated with the

15:01.578 --> 15:02.880
surface ship that he had. And this submarine was 
used in a variety of research to show some of its

15:04.041 --> 15:11.490
potential. And the Westinghouse Electric 
Company also got a submersible, had Casteau build

15:12.851 --> 15:30.572
a submersible Deep Star for them, which was rented 
and used. In my own thinking,

15:32.341 --> 15:41.352
belay that. The Office of Native Research started 
a deep submersible program for the combined use of

15:42.253 --> 15:59.395
how deep should military submarines go to, and how 
can you learn more about the background for such

15:42.253 --> 15:59.395
things as that. and more particular for the 
factors involved in making submersibles

16:00.235 --> 16:11.528
go deeper for any purpose whatsoever. In this 
vein, they sponsored work at the model basin. And

16:19.077 --> 16:24.203
Ed Wink was a very important person here. He had 
been a mechanical engineer at the model basin.

16:30.239 --> 16:31.420
working in submarines. He then went down to 
Southwest Research Institute.

16:38.266 --> 16:45.733
ONR sponsored research work there on factors 
having to do with deep submersibles and hull

16:38.266 --> 16:45.733
design. Ed got in touch with

16:47.115 --> 16:58.305
Lewis Reynolds, the Reynolds Metals Company, who 
had been a, as a, very young man or boy had met Simon

16:58.910 --> 17:04.958
Lake and was convinced that submarines had a 
future. After he grew up and became one of the top

17:06.560 --> 17:15.431
administrators in the Reynolds Metals Company, 
he had the finances to do something about it.

17:19.536 --> 17:27.246
So while a few oceanographers were concerned with 
how one operates at depth, The ONR was putting some

17:28.778 --> 17:41.353
money into this game, perhaps a quarter of a 
million dollars a year in one way or another,

17:28.778 --> 17:41.353
perhaps double that in some aspects. Ed Wink hit 
the jackpot with Lewis Reynolds, and

17:42.975 --> 17:55.950
preliminary work was proceeding on the design of 
Illuminati.

17:58.816 --> 18:06.444
I had been one of those people who felt the 
submersible had a future. Hadn't worried too much

18:06.484 --> 18:20.480
about the exact details of it, except that because 
the ocean is up to six miles deep, you want to build

18:06.484 --> 18:20.480
it to go as deep as is practical. But if it wasn't 
going to be consistently usable, Then it had no

18:25.057 --> 18:26.778
chance of selling. So what we tried to do was to find 
a critical group of scientists, engineers,

18:26.819 --> 18:35.706
financiers that thought that it made a good sense. 
Then get an idea of the state of the art and the

18:37.328 --> 18:47.697
amount of money that might be available and see 
about how much of a submersible it was practical to

18:37.328 --> 18:47.697
start out with.

18:52.361 --> 18:53.882
The ONR had a had a meeting on deep water work in 56, 
in which this received a good deal of discussion.

19:03.801 --> 19:15.803
And actually, it was Bill Bascom who called 
attention to the fact that, along with all the loud

19:03.801 --> 19:15.803
talk, if we really had anything to say, we should 
end up so that the assembled group had a specific

19:17.808 --> 19:26.458
recommendation to give to the science world as a 
whole, the Navy in particular. So the part that

19:27.699 --> 19:40.154
Bill Bascom played in getting a specific 
recommendation going that the United States

19:27.699 --> 19:40.154
should have a deep submersible capability was 
very important.

19:43.878 --> 19:44.659
That report That meeting, incidentally, was 
written up as the National Academy of Sciences

19:45.044 --> 19:52.455
special publication.

19:57.703 --> 20:13.667
Although the design work of the new submersible, 
which turned out to be called Illuminat, was being

19:57.703 --> 20:13.667
done at Southwest Research Institute under the 
direction of Ed Wink and under the sponsorship of

20:14.795 --> 20:16.717
Lewis Reynolds at Reynolds Metals Company. Fred 
Spees from Scripps and myself were asked to serve

20:17.398 --> 20:31.395
on the design committee as oceanographers to see 
to it that it was compatible with the needs of

20:17.398 --> 20:31.395
oceanography.

20:33.938 --> 20:36.861
Those were very interesting times. The 
fundamentals of designing a deep submersible

20:36.961 --> 20:41.507
were pretty clear. It was largely a question of 
what kind of materials, metals, sizes, and so

20:45.473 --> 20:57.088
forth were consistent with the sort of a budget 
that had better be in the low millions.

21:00.633 --> 21:03.117
For myself, I never really worried. On a 
philosophical point of view, I never worried

21:03.177 --> 21:13.270
about the money, because the world was operating 
about 40 research ships, 30 or 40 research ships,

21:13.621 --> 21:18.626
of which the U.S. was running about half. All of 
these would be more expensive than the

21:19.667 --> 21:33.903
submersible, and most oceanographers would 
gladly welcome another research ship, which

21:19.667 --> 21:33.903
could only improve the overall global capability 
by 3%. And it seemed logical that rather than

21:35.865 --> 21:40.810
building another general-purpose research 
ship, it would make more sense to build some

21:41.195 --> 21:53.550
special purpose ships that could go down to the 
bottom and look with the eyeball. And in

21:55.372 --> 22:08.147
actuality, these are really perhaps more 
comparable to the fact that the geologist has long

21:55.372 --> 22:08.147
been associated with the burrow or the mule. And we 
wanted some kind of a mule that would dive so we

22:08.347 --> 22:18.899
could go down and look over the terrain that was 
otherwise not accessible.

22:21.762 --> 22:32.814
The general plan behind the Illuminaut was that 
Reynolds would pay for it and sponsor it. The

22:33.495 --> 22:38.320
electric boat company would build it and do the 
detailed designs. UNR, through the hand and eye of

22:39.683 --> 22:53.935
their assistant, the Woods Hole Oceanographic 
Assistant, the Woods Hole Oceanographic

22:39.683 --> 22:53.935
Institution, would rent it and operate it for 
science. And then at some future date, it would be

22:54.155 --> 23:09.268
decided that the submarine was paid for through 
rental and it would belong to the Navy or to the

22:54.155 --> 23:09.268
Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. It turned 
out that for a variety of reasons, many of which

23:11.662 --> 23:41.128
were very legitimate and others probably seemed a 
little fuzzier, the questions of operational

23:11.662 --> 23:41.128
control and what good business were and were not 
good business practices, neither Woods Hole and

23:11.662 --> 23:41.128
Reynolds were not able to arrive at a common 
document which would permit this to happen. Woods

23:43.100 --> 23:53.793
Hole, here at Woods Hole, we had been working under 
the general assumption this would happen, might

23:43.100 --> 23:53.793
happen or would happen. We had begun to hire crew 
for the Illuminat. ONR had started giving us half a

23:59.500 --> 24:09.613
million dollars a year to prepare for this event 
and to hire crew to start buying instrumentation

23:59.500 --> 24:09.613
and getting ready. At this stage of the game, I want 
to mention that the pilot we hired, or that I had

24:10.724 --> 24:37.542
hired, was Bill, had looked up and found, was Bill 
Rainey, who was one of the heroes of the small

24:10.724 --> 24:37.542
submersible business, who was really the 
operating, he was the chief pilot and the one most

24:10.724 --> 24:37.542
responsible for it for many years.

24:40.205 --> 25:09.165
along

24:40.205 --> 25:09.165
about this time it was decided here at Woods Hole 
that the ship the submersible program would be in

24:40.205 --> 25:09.165
the under the general cognizance of Earl Hayes who 
was in the Department of Ocean Engineering and

24:40.205 --> 25:09.165
at At that time, I remained heavily involved with 
it, but more in an advisory capacity than in a line

25:09.905 --> 25:19.220
capacity.

25:23.687 --> 25:35.946
When it became apparent that the submersible 
aluminate was not going to come here, we

25:23.687 --> 25:35.946
worked with

25:39.723 --> 25:52.539
Harold Froelich from the electronics section of 
General Mills, who had been proposing that they

25:39.723 --> 25:52.539
build a small submersible called the CPOP. We 
utilized his version of that submarine, which was

25:54.241 --> 26:05.055
a very elementary, undersized submarine. Elvin 
that here was something we could buy off the shelf.

26:11.219 --> 26:14.424
We wouldn't need to rebuild and design a new 
submarine. And this was used as the

26:14.484 --> 26:26.040
administrative logic of why we should use the O and 
R money we already had and were getting to go ahead

26:14.484 --> 26:26.040
with a submersible program at Woods Hole. This 
scheme worked, and Woods Hole ended up with a

26:29.960 --> 26:35.686
submersible.

26:43.694 --> 26:47.197
We wrote up a set of specifications. We wrote up a 
set of specifications to alter the CPAP so it would

26:48.198 --> 26:54.685
meet what we considered our requirements. This 
turned out to be a good deal more of a submarine than

26:55.711 --> 26:59.896
CPOP was. And the price jumped from $250,000 up to 
$600,000 or $700,000.

27:09.647 --> 27:22.883
Then because the Navy wanted to experiment with a 
Navy-type steel, it was decided to build it out of a

27:09.647 --> 27:22.883
Navy-type steel rather than a commercial-type 
steel. This raised the price about $150,000, I

27:25.023 --> 27:35.335
think, or some such thing as this, because it 
involved a much more comprehensive test

27:25.023 --> 27:35.335
procedure. Now, one of the very important things 
in the submersible program was that many people

27:36.777 --> 27:46.808
were involved. In fact, people from many 
countries.

27:53.170 --> 27:56.154
was involved, not so much in an official capacity.

27:59.619 --> 28:09.313
But unofficially, everyone who had a submarine, 
who wanted to build a submarine, operated pretty

27:59.619 --> 28:09.313
much together, kept checking notes. We came to 
pretty much the same kinds of meetings to find out

28:09.553 --> 28:15.441
how things were going. It was clear there wasn't 
enough money for everybody to do everything. So

28:21.875 --> 28:37.434
what they tried to do was compare notes on 
operations, notes on safety, to talk to other

28:21.875 --> 28:37.434
people in the business so you could go home and tell 
your bosses that if you didn't hurry, you'd be left

28:21.875 --> 28:37.434
behind. And this was strictly a very favorable, 
pleasant, international system of everybody

28:39.276 --> 28:50.329
raising themselves with the bootstraps. This 
submersible becomes the albin. When do you start

28:55.368 --> 29:03.258
experimenting on

28:55.368 --> 29:03.258
the width of the hull of the albin? Is this when you 
begin to decide how thick the hull should be?

29:10.988 --> 29:17.717
The work on how thick the hull should be is In one 
sense, it's very complicated. In another sense,

29:21.529 --> 29:23.231
it is very elementary. From simple geometry, you 
can figure out what the forces are, because if you

29:24.572 --> 29:40.167
build a submarine only to go shallow, it is so thin 
that it is able to collapse in any number of funny

29:24.572 --> 29:40.167
modes, and you need complicated ribs. And this is a 
real job for the mathematical experts. However,

29:44.552 --> 29:47.755
if you decide to build a whole of a simple form, like 
a cylinder or even more so a sphere. And then you

29:52.212 --> 29:56.456
design it to go deep. The hole gets thick enough so 
it is what we call a simple, it would fail in pretty

29:56.616 --> 30:08.768
close to the pressure of simple collapse. And you 
would not have the thing going out of round and

30:09.569 --> 30:15.835
getting into mathematical complications. until 
you got almost to the ultimate point. So from this

30:20.537 --> 30:26.345
standpoint, the deeper the submarine goes, the 
easier it is to design. You choose the material on

30:28.387 --> 30:45.670
the basis of corrosion, on the basis of its 
strength-weight ratio, and on the basis of its

30:28.387 --> 30:45.670
cost, and on the basis of whether You can weld it, 
form it, and so forth.
