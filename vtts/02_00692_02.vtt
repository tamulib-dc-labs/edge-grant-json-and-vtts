WEBVTT

00:02.663 --> 00:14.655
So that our graduates tend to have a sort of common 
point of view, regardless of their

00:02.663 --> 00:14.655
specialization.

00:14.916 --> 00:23.865
Then they will, then of course, within their 
specialization, they will have the point of view

00:14.916 --> 00:23.865
that they pick up from those faculty members. I 
think we have been working very hard to encourage

00:23.885 --> 00:31.573
them to stand on our shoulders,

00:32.431 --> 00:38.840
to exceed what we have been able to think and 
accomplish.

00:41.544 --> 00:57.207
I think that more and more members of this 
department are involving doctoral students in

00:41.544 --> 00:57.207
research activities and co-publishing 
activities so that they finish their degrees with

00:41.544 --> 00:57.207
three or four publications already on the books. 
It's not universal, but it's expanding.

01:05.294 --> 01:14.423
The very nature of this department is that it is

01:05.294 --> 01:14.423
diverse. The people that we hire have

01:15.505 --> 01:23.953
some kind of specialization. There are very few of 
us that are generic. I'm going to put it that way.

01:29.794 --> 01:33.118
I'm on one hand and have fingers left over. 
Otherwise, they're English educators or they're

01:33.138 --> 01:43.629
reading specialists or they're math educators or 
they're elementary educators or middle school

01:33.138 --> 01:43.629
people or something. They've got some sort of 
specialization. And they tend to focus on

01:47.653 --> 01:54.801
teaching courses and working programs that that 
take advantage of their specialization. So the

01:59.405 --> 02:11.901
generalists

01:59.405 --> 02:11.901
are kind of the amalgam that holds it all together, 
if you will. And if the three or four or five of us

02:18.288 --> 02:28.801
cast our votes all together with one cluster or 
another cluster, we can have a majority, if you

02:18.288 --> 02:28.801
will. We don't really have that political in the 
way we go at it. It's much more a matter of

02:34.307 --> 02:35.789
conscience. But still, the net result of that 
interaction, interplay between the

02:35.889 --> 02:48.244
specialization and the general has been a rather 
unique kind of situation. There's diversity

02:50.725 --> 02:55.291
within commonality or something. And is there a 
pretty good degree of freedom to express that

02:55.311 --> 03:01.179
diversity and that uniqueness? Yes, yes, yes. I 
think there always has been. Certainly, when

03:03.662 --> 03:09.610
Johnson there was, and I was department head, I 
encouraged it. Where were you department head?

03:11.092 --> 03:11.853
What years? Oh, dear. Well, I'm sure it's in the... 
I was roughly... 1975 to 82. You were between

03:20.554 --> 03:25.660
Johnson and, has there been three, just Johnson 
and you and Dr. Peters? Well, David David was

03:26.020 --> 03:29.464
interim department head for one year. Okay. Okay. 
And he's serving in that capacity. I mean, he's

03:33.728 --> 03:37.092
interim department head right now in IVT. Okay. 
Now that we've talked about the department and the

03:39.574 --> 03:46.682
college and everything else, can we talk just for a 
few final moments on Robert Schutz and what

03:47.067 --> 04:03.149
contributions or what things you feel the best 
about that you've done since you've been here, or

03:47.067 --> 04:03.149
maybe some insights, observations, an anecdote, 
just something a little personal from your

03:47.067 --> 04:03.149
standpoint or from your vantage point. For that 
many years, I know there's got to be bunches of

04:03.169 --> 04:09.757
them. Well, yeah. It's been a wonderful 
experience for me. I've enjoyed it.

04:16.835 --> 04:35.721
Well, in terms of what I've done, I think 
programmatically I'm proudest of establishing,

04:16.835 --> 04:35.721
or helping to establish, I didn't do it 
single-handedly, obviously, helping to

04:16.835 --> 04:35.721
establish a sense of program for master's degrees 
and doctoral degrees, of requirements, of

04:36.393 --> 04:49.506
standards, of expectations. I've embedded a 
number of courses since I've been here. You

04:53.130 --> 04:54.131
mentioned just a couple. Well, EDCI 675, which is 
Teaching Strategies and Patterns of Learning, is

04:54.851 --> 05:03.240
one. Okay. It was designed around the idea that we 
should use what we know about how people learn to

05:04.321 --> 05:12.796
design better ways to teach them. The basic idea. I 
did it as an

05:13.637 --> 05:25.177
outraged response to the educational 
psychologists with whom I worked at Stanford who

05:13.637 --> 05:25.177
didn't care about teaching. They just said, 
learning is interesting all by itself. And I said,

05:29.633 --> 05:36.002
but why do you make teachers learn about learning 
if you're not going to help them draw the

05:29.633 --> 05:36.002
connections? And they said, that's their 
problem. It's not our problem. Then you belong in

05:41.510 --> 05:44.475
psych, I think, not in ed psych. So I thought, boy, 
if I ever get the chance, I'm going to make a course

05:45.256 --> 05:48.681
that will do that. And it's been successful since 
the first time I taught it. I expected to have five

05:51.585 --> 05:54.069
people sign up for the first year. I had 50. The 
first time I offered it, it just bowled me over. How

05:59.063 --> 06:00.305
long ago was that? It was 1971, something like 
that. And it's been taught ever since? Usually

06:05.876 --> 06:06.838
twice a year. Are you still teaching it? I still 
teach it. I'm teaching it right now. I do it

06:10.345 --> 06:14.773
differently every time, but still, that's the 
same basic focus. And John Denton shares that

06:14.793 --> 06:19.202
course with me every now and again. He teaches it. 
That's because I believe that no course should

06:20.174 --> 06:25.621
belong to somebody. Because if it does, when that 
person goes, dies, retires, whatever, it's gone.

06:31.629 --> 06:32.491
That's true. If you really believe in the content 
and the curriculum, then you've got to have two or

06:32.511 --> 06:39.801
more people that are associated with it. And I 
invented instructional theory. And I invented

06:44.807 --> 06:47.711
curriculum theory. And I invented curricular 
management theory. Well, I've done an

06:51.460 --> 06:56.890
undergraduate course that was born, struggled, 
and died. Well, those come about once in a while,

06:58.613 --> 07:01.598
too. It was a good idea to try to help the 
undergraduate see that knowledge has a

07:03.141 --> 07:16.084
structure, and that when you learn your area of 
special secondary, you learn your teaching

07:03.141 --> 07:16.084
field, you need to learn its structure. So that you 
can say to the students you teach, this is how what

07:16.621 --> 07:22.692
I'm teaching you fits into this field. This is what 
you're going to study next, and after that, what

07:22.712 --> 07:28.181
you'll be able to do, and so on and so on. And 
somebody who's got difficulties, well, you can

07:28.201 --> 07:34.673
analyze what they're missing in the structure. 
You talked a little bit, or you have mentioned

07:34.693 --> 07:38.860
several different things that you do. Can you give 
me just a brief overview? You're very busy, and we

07:41.849 --> 07:45.052
talked a lot about time. How do you balance your 
time as far as teaching and service type

07:45.833 --> 07:56.002
activities and research?

08:01.667 --> 08:11.856
In the last few years since I came back from the 
Target 2000 project, well, when I was department

08:01.667 --> 08:11.856
head, I was mostly an administrator with some 
teaching So you could say service and teaching.

08:15.459 --> 08:19.162
Target 2000 was the same story. So when I came back 
from Target 2000 in 1983,

08:19.723 --> 08:31.994
I was so far behind in everything that I had you to 
scramble. I was hanging on by my fingernails as

08:32.014 --> 08:40.722
though I was legitimate

08:32.014 --> 08:40.722
as a teacher. I crawled back. I'm reasonably 
confident of what I'm doing now. Between doing

08:48.158 --> 09:02.813
that, updating and upgrading my teaching, and 
taking care of all the doctoral people that I work

08:48.158 --> 09:02.813
with, there isn't an awful lot of time left.

09:04.455 --> 09:08.779
And that's where I'm in trouble right now. Is there 
pressure put on professors in this department or

09:08.799 --> 09:12.623
in any department To publish or to write? We're all 
expected to, all the time. It is recognized that

09:17.859 --> 09:20.282
some will be more productive than others. I have 
some things on my writing agenda that I have worked

09:21.824 --> 09:30.356
on and that I will continue to work on until I get 
them done and published. But they're hard.

09:32.579 --> 09:34.081
They're big papers. They're nasty, conceptual. 
And it requires lots of time. It requires somebody

09:40.860 --> 09:48.851
to sit down and interact with periodically in 
order to do the job right. And I said, there's a lot

09:48.871 --> 09:50.474
of time. Well, we only have so many hours, and we 
just can't do everything we'd like to do. But is

09:55.541 --> 10:03.012
there something that you would like to close with 
that kind of ties all the rules? about all the

10:03.599 --> 10:10.266
different things we've talked about with the 
College of Education and the perceptions of the

10:03.599 --> 10:10.266
past, the present, the future?

10:13.109 --> 10:30.807
Well, it seems to me that the major things that have 
happened are the tremendous growth in student

10:13.109 --> 10:30.807
body, which she's experienced and we have 
experienced. That has meant a growth in faculty.

10:33.890 --> 10:43.279
numbers and diversities, which has offered us 
wonderful opportunities to cross-fertilize. If

10:44.040 --> 10:51.107
only we could ever find the time and the 
opportunity to take advantage of that. I am

10:51.127 --> 11:02.878
rather, now, rather systematically

10:51.127 --> 11:02.878
trying to socialize with people in other 
departments and other, trying to do that. At least

11:04.045 --> 11:10.396
of letting them know that we're not boring.

11:16.266 --> 11:20.494
And

11:16.266 --> 11:20.494
also with students. I've started getting a lot of 
entertaining with graduate students, which I've

11:20.854 --> 11:25.783
enjoyed a lot. When you say systematically, and 
I've had that feeling from a lot of teachers that

11:26.270 --> 11:31.858
they don't get to do that enough. How do you 
systematically go about it? Because everybody

11:33.921 --> 11:40.070
has to make a concentrated effort because it does 
not just happen because of the time constraints.

11:40.090 --> 11:42.754
Well, you see, I'm in a somewhat unique position. 
I'm in the process of a divorce, so I have no

11:43.275 --> 11:47.521
children now. My children are grown, having 
children of their own. So if I want to have somebody

11:51.076 --> 11:55.500
in for dinner on Tuesday night, I have nobody to 
consult but me. So there's no family disruption

11:57.622 --> 12:02.827
that occurs as a result. I normally confine my 
activity to the weekends, but occasionally, if

12:03.088 --> 12:14.399
there's a need for something, Tuesday night or 
Wednesday night. No, you simply have to say to

12:16.180 --> 12:20.965
yourself, it's time to get out of the rut. Quit 
seeing the same old people. To some degree, that

12:25.702 --> 12:30.650
says you've got to take a little more risk. You've 
got to invite

12:30.670 --> 12:42.149
somebody that you think is somewhat

12:30.670 --> 12:42.149
more prestigious than you are in the hierarchy of 
things. And if they say no, why, you aren't going to

12:43.291 --> 12:47.037
be crushed by it. So far, they've all said yes. 
Maybe everybody's looking for somebody to start.

12:54.371 --> 12:56.233
Somebody has to make that initial move. Well, I 
like it. I'm really having a lot of fun doing it. As I

13:01.020 --> 13:13.736
get to know people there, a lot of the strangeness 
is cross-departmental

13:01.020 --> 13:13.736
operation resolved. It's fun. That's great. So I 
think

13:15.485 --> 13:37.105
we can look for some interesting kinds of 
developments in the next few years, on a number of

13:15.485 --> 13:37.105
fronts, and hope that as the university evolves in 
its growth toward excellence, we will be a part of

13:15.485 --> 13:37.105
that. I don't have time probably to go into this, 
but you kept mentioning or referencing the Target

13:37.608 --> 13:45.862
2000. Did you? Were you? I was the staff director of 
that. For this college or for the? For the whole

13:53.174 --> 13:54.175
system. I didn't know that. Two years.

14:00.085 --> 14:00.666
That report. Okay, great. Dr. Schultz, thank you. 
I really enjoyed it. visiting with you and

14:04.422 --> 14:10.987
learning a little bit more about this department 
and your perceptions of what has gone on. And I hope

14:11.007 --> 14:14.280
that you'll let me come back if I have a few added 
questions.
