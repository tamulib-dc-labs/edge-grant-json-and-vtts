WEBVTT

00:02.714 --> 00:07.979
Were you and the others working in this building 
aware that his health was declining? I don't think

00:09.180 --> 00:10.040
I was. I wasn't either. And do you remember hearing 
the news that he had died? That is not... I'm sure I

00:20.850 --> 00:27.035
did, but right now I don't recall exactly when it 
was that we knew. And his body was in state here in

00:27.496 --> 00:31.219
the... main lobby of the building. Was it for one 
day or longer? Seems like it was longer, but I'm not

00:39.234 --> 00:41.238
sure. I don't remember either. And work continued 
in the offices during that time. And I think there

00:47.872 --> 01:09.351
have been times when they thought that the when 
they when the chief executive officer was both the

00:47.872 --> 01:09.351
chancellor and the president they thought that 
was too heavy a load for and maybe some of this was

00:47.872 --> 01:09.351
caused by but I'm not sure if that had anything to do 
with it. Because he he at the time of his death was

01:10.932 --> 01:13.955
both. I think so. President and Chancellor. um 
then ludic he was interim president briefly then

01:17.285 --> 01:45.148
jack williams became president what was your 
impression of him well i had a good impression of dr

01:17.285 --> 01:45.148
williams as far as i knew he was a fine president 
what but you know dr monroe i didn't have close

01:17.285 --> 01:45.148
contact with those people it was just that i knew 
they were and respected them and thought they were

01:45.770 --> 01:48.334
I have no negative comments. But I'm assuming if 
you saw them in the hallway, was Williams

01:48.354 --> 01:54.483
outgoing? I don't remember much about that.

02:02.395 --> 02:05.260
Dean, Dr. Kunkel became the dean. Before he got to 
be dean, I went to work for Dr. Patterson. Okay. Dr.

02:11.309 --> 02:13.853
Patterson loses his secretary and He had told Dr. 
Kunkel he was going to ask me to come over there. So

02:18.858 --> 02:22.965
Dr. Kunkel called me at home and said, Dr. 
Patterson's going to ask you to work for him. And I

02:23.826 --> 02:27.132
said, well, I'll help him, but I'm not going to work 
for him. But Dr. Patterson wouldn't have it any

02:27.152 --> 02:29.115
other way. And he found somebody for Dr. Kunkel. 
Oh, okay. So I went over to the dean's office before

02:33.182 --> 02:38.912
Dr. Kunkel did for about a year maybe or so. I was 
here when Dr. Patterson was on his way, you know,

02:39.128 --> 02:46.619
was leaving the university. Where did he go or did 
he retire? No, he went to Thailand. Oh, okay. And he

02:53.670 --> 03:06.790
got an international assignment and he had had a 
low blood count for a long time and he had had it

02:53.670 --> 03:06.790
checked. over and over again, both here on campus, 
I think, and maybe at Temple. And they didn't want

03:12.830 --> 03:14.873
to let him go to Thailand. But he persuaded them 
that that was normal for him. Uh-oh. So they let him

03:21.201 --> 03:22.643
go for two years. And no problem? No, I don't think 
so. Oh, I thought you were going to... No, he went

03:28.711 --> 03:31.856
to, he got to go. But it took a while to go into 
doctors and Houston and Temple to persuade them

03:35.542 --> 03:40.810
that his health was alright. Did he retire from A&M 
when he left? I would imagine he did. In other

03:48.361 --> 03:49.904
words, he did not take leave? No, no. He did not take 
leave. And Dr. Kunkel, did he become Super Dean?

03:57.956 --> 04:03.945
No, he was the interim Super Dean for about a year 
and they recruited to fill that position. And it

04:04.246 --> 04:06.870
ended up that Dr. Kunkel got the position. Were you 
all happy with that position? Yes, I was. I was very

04:10.435 --> 04:12.217
happy with that. They brought in someone from 
California for interview, but Dr. Kunkel was

04:12.638 --> 04:22.051
named dean, and he at that time was the super dean. 
Describe the differences in working for these

04:22.832 --> 04:26.877
various deans.

04:32.124 --> 04:32.565
I don't know. Which one put in the longest hours?

04:39.404 --> 04:40.145
I'm trying to think. Dr. Kunkel put in long hours.

04:45.012 --> 04:46.734
I remember Dr. Patterson. We knew when he was going 
out of town, he'd wear his boots. And, you know, he

04:52.262 --> 04:53.044
drove. They drove everywhere they went about that 
time. They were always... driving and you had

04:58.550 --> 05:14.853
these travel vouchers and you had to put down the 
mileage and they went and the around the between

04:58.550 --> 05:14.853
the towns and then the mileage that was driven in 
the area. So you've been doing a lot of travel

05:15.514 --> 05:19.039
vouchers that had mileage. And sometimes he would 
go all the way to El Paso and the Panhandle and

05:19.643 --> 05:25.151
Weslaco. Everywhere they went, he would drive. Of 
the deans we've chatted about so far, did some of

05:31.600 --> 05:40.613
them have favorite research projects? Was one 
more interested in cattle and the other more

05:42.276 --> 05:46.782
interested in this or that? Well, I guess they 
can't really be that way, you know. They have to,

05:49.971 --> 06:13.478
and I'm amazed at sometimes, sometimes I'm amazed 
or all the time amazed at how broad they, you know,

05:49.971 --> 06:13.478
they are in areas that they know what's going on 
with in the plant and the animal and biotechnology

05:49.971 --> 06:13.478
or whatever the area is that they could come out of a 
particular field and then be seemingly become so

06:14.335 --> 06:19.320
broadly. Now when they were getting ready to go on a 
trip what did you try to gather together for them?

06:27.848 --> 06:36.416
Well anything that pertained to their travel 
without the position I mean the purpose of the

06:27.848 --> 06:36.416
trip. But that might be a big stack of materials. 
Well sometimes it might be but most of the time

06:39.219 --> 06:42.942
wasn't that big. So, Dean Kunkel, of the men you 
worked for, he was dean the longest, I guess? Yes,

06:52.304 --> 06:52.644
sir. His tenure over here was from 1960, December 
of 62, until May of 88. But some of that time, when

07:05.638 --> 07:09.182
Dr. Miller became the president, He changed Dr. 
Kunkel's appointment to just be dean of the

07:09.888 --> 07:16.475
college. And he had O.D. Butler as vice president, 
or associate vice president, and Perry Atkinson

07:19.518 --> 07:27.166
was the vice president for agriculture at that 
time. And that took the Experiment Station and

07:27.427 --> 07:33.533
Extension Service and put it under their 
administration. All right, but your task was

07:33.968 --> 07:41.136
still to be the, and what was the title by then? 
Probably, first it was executive secretary. I

07:46.422 --> 07:50.227
went from administrative to executive and then to 
assistant to the dean. And gradually electric

07:52.389 --> 07:57.355
typewriters and then computers. Yes, sir. 
Automatic telephones. When I came back to work, in

08:01.323 --> 08:12.001
58 they had gotten electric typewriters and when 
they wanted me to fill out a form I first asked for a

08:01.323 --> 08:12.001
manual typewriter for the form but it doesn't take 
long till you get the touch. Of all these

08:13.063 --> 08:19.333
technological changes which one was the most 
difficult to adjust to? Well I think it took me a day

08:20.295 --> 08:24.782
or two to get used to an electric typewriter And now 
I use the computer, but I don't know all things

08:25.235 --> 08:30.784
about the computer. A lot of these girls do. And if I 
get stuck, I ask for help. Over in the lab? I've

08:38.458 --> 08:42.805
never gone to take instruction on the computer. 
Over in the library, when we have a problem, we turn

08:43.257 --> 08:52.774
to one of the students to explain to us how to solve 
the problem. Back to campus administration. Do

08:58.900 --> 09:06.800
you remember when your thoughts or the reaction 
when Dr. Williams became ill, his heart attack?

09:06.820 --> 09:12.234
Well, there again, we think this is too much of a 
position for one person. If that had anything to do

09:13.818 --> 09:15.542
with it, I don't know. Then, Dr. Miller, you say he 
reorganized. Which was better? Which

09:23.952 --> 09:27.078
organizational pattern, from your point of view, 
was better? To have the super dean or to divide it

09:27.378 --> 09:31.906
up? Well, to me, I was used to the super dean and I 
thought that was a good organization. During all

09:39.248 --> 09:49.440
those years, did you have much contact, you and 
your staff, with board members, directors, then

09:39.248 --> 09:49.440
regents? No, sir, except Bob Cherry was upstairs, 
and sometime we got assignments down here, you

09:49.460 --> 09:58.290
know, to help get ready for the board meeting. In 
fact, I probably still have thank yous from Bob

09:58.931 --> 10:06.420
Cherry thanking us for, they were right upstairs, 
and if they had some materials they needed to type

10:07.480 --> 10:10.066
or get ready for the board. We did that a few times. 
And this would be, by and large, informational

10:11.689 --> 10:15.257
material. Informational. What about 
legislature? Did the dean, the director? Yes,

10:22.612 --> 10:22.933
sir. I remember at that time when I came over here, 
They're going to the legislature and that's

10:27.190 --> 10:30.054
getting materials ready. In fact, I have driven 
out to the airport and handed Dr. Kunkel some

10:30.174 --> 10:40.547
materials on brush control or other things when 
they were ready to take off to go to Austin. Over all

10:42.509 --> 10:48.397
the years, what were some of the controversial 
agricultural topics? Some of the research

10:49.618 --> 10:54.885
projects or topics that caused the greatest 
discussion? I don't know whether I can answer that

10:56.300 --> 10:57.983
or not. At the moment, I don't think of situations 
where the most controversial. I was trying to

11:06.339 --> 11:09.786
think of some where the politicians would have 
argued. I'm sure there are some. I would feel sure

11:12.090 --> 11:14.455
there are some. All right, then Dr. Ernstson. came 
as Deputy Chancellor and Dean so we go back to the

11:17.950 --> 11:38.760
Super Dean yes and just where did he come from Dr. 
Ernst I think he came from industry okay and the

11:17.950 --> 11:38.760
East and I'm not sure whether it was DuPont or some 
organization How did you and your staff educate

11:38.825 --> 11:42.429
him about the way Texas A&M did things? Well, when 
he came, he asked me about, you know, talked to me

11:42.449 --> 11:49.256
about, you know, about working for him. And he 
indicated I would have to stop what I was doing now

11:49.836 --> 11:55.702
and just be at his, you know, helping in his office. 
Because at that time, he would take the person who

11:58.365 --> 12:03.710
was assistant to the meetings. I think he soon 
stopped that. But... We had I would he would

12:08.457 --> 12:35.292
sometimes throw things in the trash that I would 
probably be fishing out, you know That he and he

12:08.457 --> 12:35.292
came over here and he our offices weren't 
decorative they Enough he we took all the pictures

12:08.457 --> 12:35.292
of the Dean's down and we made some changes Then Dr. 
Lee came and And then briefly, he was briefly, and

12:36.554 --> 12:39.438
then Ed Heiler. Dr. Lee was here, I think, as 
interim

12:40.459 --> 12:48.931
from January to September. Okay. And then Ed 
Heiler. Then Ed Heiler. Who came from

12:53.817 --> 12:57.222
agricultural engineering back then. No, sir, he 
had already, he had left agricultural

12:57.242 --> 13:02.389
engineering, was over in the chancellor's 
office. Oh, okay. I think he was interim

13:03.350 --> 13:05.633
chancellor for a while. And before that, he had had 
another title in that office, though. But no, I was

13:10.858 --> 13:13.480
meaning his discipline was agricultural 
engineering. Oh, yes, sir. It is. All right. And so

13:16.183 --> 13:22.048
now, for eight years, you've been working with 
him. Right. Describe his style of leadership.

13:25.951 --> 13:28.013
Well, he's tried very hard. Well, he's 
accomplishing it, I think, of the cooperative

13:28.193 --> 13:35.400
research extension and teaching He believes in 
integrating all of that. About how many people now

13:42.416 --> 13:47.442
are on the staff of the Vice Chancellor and Dean? 
How many people do you have to watch over? Well,

13:52.048 --> 13:58.536
right now I'm not watching over very many as far as 
I'm concerned, but this office has grown. You

13:59.225 --> 14:22.433
know, because now they put the extension service 
in the experiment station, and we have one

13:59.225 --> 14:22.433
directory, you know, where it's, but even then, 
through the years, the programs have grown and the

13:59.225 --> 14:22.433
research has grown, so there's a lot more people 
here now than there were when I came over. What do

14:23.814 --> 14:28.540
you think have been Dr. Heiler's, major most most 
important objectives?

14:35.375 --> 14:53.599
I think they have vision you know visioning and 
wanting to meet the ever-changing needs of the

14:35.375 --> 14:53.599
agriculture and the life sciences and improve

14:35.375 --> 14:53.599
the the progress. Who are the most important 
pressure groups, the most important

14:54.305 --> 15:05.764
organizations in Texas agriculture that y'all 
work with? Well my main job right now is faculty

15:06.706 --> 15:16.482
promotion and tenure,

15:16.917 --> 15:26.410
the hiring, you know, the appointment papers that 
we send to the dean of faculties and reports and so I

15:16.917 --> 15:26.410
don't work with them. I'm sure there are people in 
this office to give you a very much better answer on

15:26.470 --> 15:31.938
that than I can. Right now I'm not going to ask the 
negative, the positive. Of the deans you've

15:36.004 --> 15:42.553
worked with, which one was the most pleasant to 
work with? Well I have had very good bosses all

15:43.833 --> 15:47.216
along. They're all. I knew Dr. Heiler when he came 
as an assistant professor. I knew him as

15:54.553 --> 16:10.390
department head, and I did something for him that 
he never has forgotten, and that is when the

15:54.553 --> 16:10.390
administration didn't want to approve his 
secretary's raise because he had recommended it

15:54.553 --> 16:10.390
higher than they thought. Dr. Heiler was in a 
meeting in Florida. And I called him, and he

16:14.798 --> 16:22.530
dictated the justification to me, and it went 
through, and he never forgets it. Good, good,

16:23.151 --> 16:24.253
good.

16:29.060 --> 16:34.208
In his routine, are there birthday parties in the 
office? Well, now we have usually the first Friday

16:34.525 --> 16:44.218
and we celebrate everybody's

16:34.525 --> 16:44.218
birthday that was in that month. Ah, okay. Usually 
they call it Fat Friday, but there is someone

16:46.461 --> 16:50.827
designated to bring the birthday cake. And 
normally what time is the office open and what time

16:52.790 --> 16:58.558
does it close? It's open here by 7 o'clock. Dr. 
Hyler is here early, and they, Dr. Krieger's going

17:01.651 --> 17:10.682
into his office, maybe others, and they get 
started early. And about what time does the last

17:12.024 --> 17:15.528
one leave? I think some, I think generally around 
5, but it could be later. Did Dr. Hyler hear longer

17:24.219 --> 17:29.085
hours than some of the other, than the other deans 
were? I don't really think so. He may be coming to

17:31.278 --> 17:32.540
work earlier.

17:35.885 --> 17:36.285
Let's see. Of all these years, what are some of the 
happiest moments you remember?

17:45.059 --> 17:46.280
I guess I've just had a good time. Most all the time. 
I'm just trying to think what would have been the

17:48.564 --> 17:52.249
happiest.

17:55.054 --> 17:57.317
Was there a contract that was approved? Somebody 
got promoted or? I'm not really remembering that.

18:02.692 --> 18:06.297
And you're questioning right now because I've 
been thinking about it. Remember any sad moments?

18:08.299 --> 18:08.640
Yes, sir. I've seen some sad moments. I was working 
the day that Roy Sims got ripped, was on the killing

18:11.263 --> 18:22.517
floor and ripped this knife into his stomach and 
bled to death there. And I was on duty that Saturday

18:22.717 --> 18:24.600
morning. That was a sad time. Back in the 40s? Yes, 
sir. I think it was in the 40s.

18:33.891 --> 18:42.140
I don't remember exactly when it was, but there's 
still a story about that building that his ghost is

18:33.891 --> 18:42.140
over in the animal industry's building. The 
students carry that on. Are there some

18:45.524 --> 18:52.131
politicians that you remember that have been 
particularly helpful to agriculture?

18:54.894 --> 18:57.257
State or federal politicians that helped? I can't 
recall their names at the moment. I'm sure they

19:00.525 --> 19:01.286
are. Bill Moore or Tiger Teague or John Connolly or 
Lyndon Johnson. Yes, sir. I'm sure there's some

19:06.032 --> 19:13.161
that have been chair of the finance committee 
who've been helpful. And then there's probably

19:13.541 --> 19:17.907
been some that we thought might be helpful more to 
someone else. Of the presidents that A&M has had in

19:19.169 --> 19:26.738
your experience, which one supported 
agriculture most, you think? there again it's

19:28.658 --> 19:52.287
kind of hard for me to really know okay um let's see 
remember any jokes or pranks or goofy things i'm

19:28.658 --> 19:52.287
afraid i'm not very uh good today on pranks and and 
jokes all right um I believe I told you the other

19:54.241 --> 20:08.326
day, of course this is not a prank or a joke, that I 
remember Mr. Rutter saying he signed things

19:54.241 --> 20:08.326
because, and this is not to do with that, but 
because of the signatures he sees on the document

19:54.241 --> 20:08.326
before he signs. I did tell you that the other day on 
the phone. But I can't think of...

20:11.892 --> 20:16.620
Pranks... And has it been pleasant for a woman to 
work on this campus? Yes, sir. I mean it's been very

20:25.495 --> 20:26.997
pleasant. And in your office have you had, in 
today's terminology, have you had a diversity of

20:28.520 --> 20:37.953
staff members? Have there been some Hispanic? 
Yes, sir. We have a number around our office. And we

20:44.750 --> 20:48.013
probably have more Hispanic than we do black. But 
we have both, all. And do you think that they would

20:51.877 --> 20:57.082
feel positive about working in the office? Yes, 
sir. I would hope so. How did you feel when Texas A&M

21:00.326 --> 21:08.133
changed to coeducation and non-compulsory core? 
Well, that I liked. My daughters were permitted to

21:10.381 --> 21:15.448
come to Texas A&M and get a degree. So that was good 
for us. I don't know whether we would have been

21:17.390 --> 21:24.600
easily able to send them to another university. 
How did they, if I were interviewing them, what

21:24.980 --> 21:30.728
would they say about what it was like for them to be 
students here? Did they feel they were treated

21:31.409 --> 21:32.691
well? Yes, sir. They did. Sometimes they were the 
only one or two women in the class, but they felt

21:34.331 --> 21:42.604
they were treated well. Well, very good. I have 
just about run out of questions I can think of. What

21:47.812 --> 21:50.857
have we not covered that we might have? Not sure. Of 
what are you most proud, after working here all

21:53.421 --> 21:57.988
these years? I think I'm proud that I've had 
wonderful people to work for and with in

21:59.555 --> 22:07.070
agriculture. I think that's maybe the best on the 
campus, but that's what I know. And when I came over

22:12.741 --> 22:19.494
here to this office, we had someone down named 
Clark Monroe. You remember Clark Monroe? He told

22:21.728 --> 22:27.576
me at the time that when he called me about these 
vacancies, he said, I think you can get either one

22:21.728 --> 22:27.576
of them. One of them was for Dr. Graff, Dean Graff, a 
staff dean. And I thought I wanted to work for

22:33.203 --> 22:36.327
agriculture. And that would have been in Mr. 
Rutter's office. And they told me, Mr. Rutter

22:41.494 --> 22:45.559
sometimes will come out, although you work for 
Dean Graff, He will come out and give you work to do.

22:49.798 --> 22:55.810
I did talk to Dr. Dean Graff, and he told me, he said, 
you may be here longer than I am. And he wasn't here

22:56.672 --> 22:58.215
too long. Clark, he spells his name differently 
for me, but they're close friends of ours. The

23:04.162 --> 23:08.947
Heilers and Clark and Virginia Monroe were in the 
Sunday school class I taught at the Presbyterian

23:04.162 --> 23:08.947
Church. Oh, really? And I'm going to interview 
Clark in San Antonio Friday. So I will tell him that

23:12.871 --> 23:14.553
you mentioned him. Yes. And I presume you went to 
him because he was the personnel officer at that

23:17.316 --> 23:20.820
point. No, they came to me. Oh, okay. I was in animal 
science. All right. I was contacted about these

23:26.026 --> 23:29.029
positions. All right, of all the people you have 
worked with, if we could have them all together,

23:29.633 --> 23:37.302
which ones would you want to thank most?

23:40.105 --> 23:41.887
Which ones do you feel most grateful for? Well, I 
would, of course, Dr. Butler's not here now. No,

23:45.831 --> 23:49.075
but if we could bring them all back, that's what I'm 
saying. Dr. Jack Miller, Dr. O.D. Butler, Dr. H.O.

23:53.600 --> 23:58.746
Kunkel, Dr. Krieger now, and Dr. Heiler. And what 
do you think is the most important reason for your

24:00.295 --> 24:09.188
long success in this task? I suppose that I have 
tried to do my job as well as I can. And I've been, I

24:16.999 --> 24:21.865
think, loyal to them as far as an employee. I've 
tried to be. And they have all been excellent

24:23.648 --> 24:26.792
bosses. I've never had anyone that I hated to get up 
and go to work that day. It's been a pleasure to work

24:31.706 --> 24:35.660
in the offices. And I've been interested in the 
things that have happened in agriculture. in the

24:40.357 --> 24:44.523
academic and the research that I've known about. 
Of course, I'm not specifically naming those

24:44.563 --> 24:47.267
things. But agriculture is just, to me, of course, 
I would put it at the top of the university. And I'm

24:54.757 --> 24:59.584
sure people who are working in other areas would do 
their areas would say that about where they work,

24:54.757 --> 24:59.584
too. I've seen lots of people come and go in this 
office since I've been working here. And I used to

25:05.011 --> 25:06.493
supervise the girls. But we didn't have as many as 
we have now. I remember one that came from the east

25:10.934 --> 25:14.200
and was wearing the miniskirt. And Dr. Kunkel and 
Dr. Potts told me I should tell her that her dress

25:14.861 --> 25:19.570
was too short. And it wasn't long until that style 
came here and others were doing it. So you didn't

25:28.927 --> 25:29.769
tell her? Yes, I did tell her. Oh, you did? Oh, okay. 
I did tell her. All right. How did pantsuits come

25:35.491 --> 25:38.916
into acceptance? They didn't go over very well 
either at first. And when they did allow it, you

25:42.121 --> 25:51.575
were supposed to have coats, pantsuits, not just 
anything, and the coats coming down to your

25:42.121 --> 25:51.575
fingertips. Now that was not a written rule. No, it 
wasn't a written rule. But you didn't wear short

25:57.664 --> 25:59.807
jackets? Because I remember when Jeanette Ferris 
went to Dr. John C. Calhoun on behalf of the other

26:00.665 --> 26:11.818
women to ask if it would be okay, and Dr. Calhoun's 
response was laughter. To say, of course it's okay

26:12.959 --> 26:17.044
if you women think it's proper. I know one time I 
went somewhere, I think it was when my husband

26:17.324 --> 26:25.653
died, and I had to go somewhere, and then I came back 
in and I had on a patent suit, and Dr. Calhoun told me

26:17.324 --> 26:25.653
it looked nice. But I know that we had, we knew, what 
kind of pantsuits you could wear. And I presume

26:32.872 --> 26:40.722
you've had lots of student part-time employees 
working in and around the office. And I assume that

26:41.683 --> 26:48.912
they have been an important part of the team. Yes, 
sir. They are. We used to have maybe one or two in my

26:52.256 --> 26:59.224
office in animal science, and then they have 
several students working in this office now. What

26:59.845 --> 27:08.477
kind of advice would you give to, during these 
years, what kind of advice did you give to a new

26:59.845 --> 27:08.477
staff member when they came to work in the office? 
What advice did you give them to start off? I think

27:12.162 --> 27:21.195
we gave them their responsibilities, and most of 
the time they performed them all right. And one

27:22.576 --> 27:31.769
time in animal science, the extension service had 
someone that was over all the secretarial staff of

27:22.576 --> 27:31.769
the extension service. And one of the men in 
extension had someone working for them that

27:32.750 --> 27:36.836
wasn't working well. Dr. Butler said he didn't 
hire, but he could fire.

27:42.363 --> 27:48.111
But most of the time, you know, we've had really, 
not everybody's worked out, but generally, yes.

27:48.175 --> 27:52.904
If a new person joins your staff now, do you try to 
have a brief session with them? Well, I'm not

27:52.964 --> 27:55.028
responsible for that. I'm working more with Dr. 
Krieger and Dr. Heiler and Faculty Matters and

27:55.609 --> 28:04.887
some reports, academic reports. And our student 
records and Advising is over in Kleberg now. It's

28:15.066 --> 28:16.047
not in this building. Now, are you the senior 
employee in terms of your original employment

28:17.530 --> 28:22.939
date on the campus? I don't know that for sure, but I 
wouldn't be surprised. And I presume you're proud

28:27.146 --> 28:29.069
of that. Yes, sir. I don't think about it very 
often, but recently I was reminded of it. Uh, last

28:36.404 --> 28:41.250
question I can think to ask, what feelings do you 
hold in your heart for Texas A&M? How do you feel

28:42.852 --> 28:43.974
about this place? I like this place. It's a great 
place to, and I think, and I'm thankful many times

28:47.298 --> 28:54.147
that Texas A&M University is located here. 
Because I'm thinking Bryan College Station

28:55.088 --> 29:01.216
wouldn't be near the place they are if Texas A&M 
wasn't here. We'd probably be like Navasota. or

29:04.771 --> 29:06.961
some of those other small towns around. It's made a 
lot of difference. Let's quit on that.
