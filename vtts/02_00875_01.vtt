00:01.634 --> 00:05.057
Joe Chow, Assistant Planning Director for the 
City of Houston. This is the 12th of June, 1987.

00:09.101 --> 00:25.817
Joe, would you please recount how you got into 
planning, and then go from that point to where you

00:09.101 --> 00:25.817
are now, and how this involves the City of Houston? 
How I got into planning? I just happened to land a

00:28.320 --> 00:30.662
job with the department. Well, I guess... How did 
you go into... Why did you study planning? Okay, I

00:34.877 --> 00:42.425
graduated from Texas A&M with a master's planning 
program in 1972. I finished my degree in the summer

00:43.547 --> 00:59.485
session and was looking for a job, and one of the 
places that I applied for a job was the city of

00:43.547 --> 00:59.485
Houston planning department, and at that time 
they had happened to have a vacancy, and I started

01:00.629 --> 01:10.277
as a planner, too, in charge of, or at least I was 
right away assigned to downtown planning. And at

01:11.959 --> 01:16.223
that time, they were doing some reports for 
downtown, and I picked up on that. Identifying

01:17.123 --> 01:30.315
the existing conditions, making projections of 
the employment population, and

01:30.532 --> 01:38.744
checking out the current development and things 
like that. Really, it's more like a data book, so to

01:38.784 --> 01:42.810
speak. It's what's going on rather than try to do a 
downtown plan, so to speak. Roscoe Jones was the

01:51.743 --> 01:53.345
director then. Roscoe Jones was the director. 
That's correct.

01:58.813 --> 02:00.235
I guess... Because of the nature of planning in 
Houston at that time, our hands were tied to a

02:00.468 --> 02:20.758
certain extent that we would do reports that would 
spend more time on the current conditions and

02:00.468 --> 02:20.758
pointing out possibly some of the problems that 
exist.

02:24.423 --> 02:29.631
To a certain extent, we recommended 
identification solution, but not in the

02:29.948 --> 02:34.916
recommendation form. Some action should be 
taken, so to speak. That was during the fast growth

02:38.641 --> 02:41.546
area of Houston. Well, the 72 is growing not as fast 
as it was in the later part of the 70s and early part

02:41.906 --> 02:50.580
of the 80s. Sort of the beginning of that, right? 
The beginning, yeah. And so through that, I Also

02:59.142 --> 03:11.374
did some parks planning,

02:59.142 --> 03:11.374
area planning reports, such as the Galleria data 
books, so to speak. We were very

03:11.834 --> 03:28.390
careful as to not identify any publication of the 
plans, so to speak, because we were under the

03:11.834 --> 03:28.390
impression that anything identified as a plan 
with the public

03:28.842 --> 03:41.936
interest or opposition, so to speak, that we're 
really trying to get something going. I'm not

03:41.956 --> 03:55.291
saying that that posture is totally wrong, but to 
me, it's probably the policy that's filtering

03:41.956 --> 03:55.291
down from the mayor's office at that time. Who was 
the mayor? First it was through Welsh, and then it

03:56.669 --> 04:03.778
was Hawthorne, and then it was Jim McComb. Of 
course, when Mayor Whitmire came in, she quickly

04:05.140 --> 04:15.973
changed the planning director to Ethan Boise, 
which was about a year. I think about a year after

04:17.255 --> 04:23.723
she searched the country for the planning 
director, And Roscoe was quite near retirement at

04:24.850 --> 04:28.776
that time, wasn't he? Roscoe had 18 years in the 
department. 18. As far as I know, about 18 or

04:32.582 --> 04:35.747
something around there. Well, the policy, is it 20 
years that you get retirement? You can get

04:41.175 --> 04:47.625
retirement with 10 years and attain a certain age. 
I see. Probably when Roscoe... leave the

04:52.390 --> 04:53.591
department. He was not old enough to actually get 
retirement benefit, but I think he's invested. So

04:59.116 --> 05:10.105
when he attained his own age, he would probably 
draw retirement for the 18 or so

04:59.116 --> 05:10.105
years. That's interesting. But Whitmer wanted 
her own man in as planning director. Well, I'm sure

05:18.773 --> 05:22.296
everybody knows that Mayor Whitmire had 
identified that she wants to run the city like a

05:22.630 --> 05:29.877
business corporation. And she had her own idea and 
policies of how the city should be run. And she

05:35.041 --> 05:50.916
quickly moved to study how various departments 
could be more efficient and that the whole system

05:35.041 --> 05:50.916
of the city employees could be reorganized and 
there was a commission appointed to do studies

05:51.385 --> 06:20.717
about various departments how they work together 
or how they haven't been working together and so on

05:51.385 --> 06:20.717
and there was a report out to uh we organized the 
city department into four or five major city

05:51.385 --> 06:20.717
departments putting together some of them and the 
first one that was put together was finance

06:21.220 --> 06:29.731
administration, combining tax department and 
some general services or some other departments.

06:29.751 --> 06:32.154
I don't even know what the names were at that time 
anymore. And then I think the second one is

06:33.075 --> 06:38.702
probably the planning department. We took over 
the economic development office of the mayor. We

06:43.127 --> 06:49.135
took over, okay, when finance administration was 
formed, the mayor's policy planning department

06:49.638 --> 06:57.070
was absorbed by that particular department. Was 
that the one that Rick Gerlach was in? Yes. And then

07:00.635 --> 07:07.005
we later on took over community development.

07:07.964 --> 07:11.188
It's a department with about 120 employees. Oh. At 
the time when Roscoe left, we were about 55 to 60

07:13.271 --> 07:19.379
employees. So we have taken on a whole lot more 
responsibility and picked up a lot more

07:19.399 --> 07:26.868
employees. As I remember, the chief activity of 
the planning department under Roscoe was

07:28.490 --> 07:35.119
subdivision processing. You're probably right. 
However, we do have at that time, when I first

07:36.895 --> 07:45.024
joined the department, there were four 
divisions. Development, coordination,

07:45.925 --> 07:49.929
handling plants, and development. And the major 
system right away and stuff like that. And then we

07:57.518 --> 08:04.245
have a group called research division, which 
handles population estimates. and work with the

08:04.816 --> 08:11.342
census and employment estimates and 
projections. Economics. Yeah, and we don't have

08:13.624 --> 08:21.831
that much on economics, so to speak, but 
coordination with the Chamber of Commerce

08:13.624 --> 08:21.831
Research Division.

08:24.413 --> 08:27.355
We then also did some land use studies. That would 
be Louis Welch, wouldn't it? Mayor Welch was still

08:29.938 --> 08:33.861
with the city at the time, but... The Chamber of 
Commerce historically has a very strong research

08:34.533 --> 08:48.377
division, and they were very strong in working 
with the census and population estimates and so on

08:34.533 --> 08:48.377
and so forth. In fact, every year they used to put 
out a data sheet that estimated the population for

08:48.397 --> 08:58.515
the city and the county every year. plus 
employment and so on. So they always have a very

09:01.089 --> 09:05.994
good research division, so to speak. And we have a 
small group of planners, two at a time, works with

09:06.014 --> 09:15.124
them and so on. And then we have a comprehensive 
planning division also. That division works on

09:28.145 --> 09:36.876
items such as downtown reports and also small 
areas planning reports. We did also pick up on

09:37.416 --> 09:39.819
parks. We work with parks department and we did 
some fairly good report. In fact, there were a lot

09:54.672 --> 09:59.316
better reports came out before I got here than 
after I did it. I don't know if that has anything to

09:59.856 --> 10:05.541
do with me or not.

10:05.681 --> 10:16.010
In about 1980 there was some work that was done here 
that took an overall view of the greater Houston

10:05.681 --> 10:16.010
area. Yes, we have been publishing a one-page map 
with summary back up on the back page. The first one

10:26.802 --> 10:33.230
we did was called 1990

10:26.802 --> 10:33.230
map. We didn't want to call it a plan. I noticed. 
Which identified the growth of Houston. I think it

10:44.543 --> 10:50.590
was done during the early 70s or even late 60s. 
Identifying how projected growth would take

10:53.785 --> 11:09.046
place, identifying the major regional shopping 
centers where they would fall on the intersection

10:53.785 --> 11:09.046
of major freeways and thoroughfare and so on and so 
forth. And the major transportation facilities.

11:11.489 --> 11:21.463
And the major transportation facilities such as 
freeways, which the information is available

11:11.489 --> 11:21.463
from the highway department, so to speak. 
documented it all into one piece of document. You

11:24.921 --> 11:33.412
know that when Ralph Ellefrit was the planning 
director, that the planning department did the

11:24.921 --> 11:33.412
freeway planning. That's correct. That's what 
turned to be the major trophies map, probably. And

11:42.424 --> 11:45.027
then later on, it was taken over by the highway 
people. Well, we still have the major trophy

11:45.728 --> 11:48.632
mapping responsibility. It is now part of the 
development ordinance. In fact, every time we

11:53.897 --> 12:02.387
update the major thoroughfare map, we would have 
to have council approval on it since 1977. Now

12:02.467 --> 12:13.019
that, I would say that development ordinance 
would probably be one of the major piece of work

12:02.467 --> 12:13.019
that is done under the direction of Oscar Jones. 
That much credit, I think, he deserves. Well, now

12:16.338 --> 12:28.575
Joe, does that mean that the city council actually 
makes the selection of corridors or freeways?

12:29.797 --> 12:44.438
That means the staff will recommend the layout of 
major streets, so to speak, at a mile distance grid

12:29.797 --> 12:44.438
type of and identifying the need for 
right-of-ways. Major streets but not freeways?

12:54.046 --> 12:54.327
No. Freeways, I think we work with the highway 
department to identify the location. That way for

13:00.674 --> 13:06.021
areas that's not developed, we would have some 
basis to to ensure that when they come in with a

13:06.659 --> 13:15.469
plaque, we would request them for dedication of 
the right-of-ways for major streets and so on. And

13:15.489 --> 13:18.833
we adhere pretty much to it through the years. And 
it has been, even before it became an ordinance, it

13:19.734 --> 13:32.329
was pretty much followed by the developer and 
required by the lending

13:33.457 --> 13:34.760
Why not? Right. So that we could make sure that we 
could get from one place to another in the future.

13:40.631 --> 13:42.254
Sure. Yeah, well, that was quite a change, though, 
from Ellifrit's administration to Jones, in the

13:42.274 --> 13:52.073
sense that under Ellifrit, the planning 
Department actually had responsibility for

13:52.525 --> 13:56.549
selection of freeway corridors. Well, there 
again is probably because of the growth of the

13:56.629 --> 14:00.772
Highway Department, too. Oh, I think so. It just 
happened all over the state. Responsibility just

14:03.074 --> 14:18.188
becomes distributed to the District 12 here, and 
also plus the creation of Houston-Galveston

14:03.074 --> 14:18.188
Regional Transit Study Group out of the District 
12. They would have specific responsibility to

14:21.668 --> 14:30.462
identifying, analyzing, and determining the 
major freeways between Metropolitan Houston and

14:21.668 --> 14:30.462
Galveston area. So I wouldn't say that because we 
didn't want to do it, but there is a distribution of

14:30.482 --> 14:37.834
responsibility. It just evolved that way. Right, 
it just evolved that way. And also as I was

14:41.500 --> 14:48.351
describing the divisions, Mayor McCann did later 
on created a neighborhood planning division,

14:48.567 --> 14:55.214
which takes care of inner city area. Of course, 
1974, we got into the community development and

14:55.234 --> 15:05.265
start getting community development money. And 
of course, the mayor created a CD office at the

15:05.765 --> 15:11.431
mayor's office. But the basic area planning type 
of function was given to the neighborhood

15:17.710 --> 15:24.116
planning division of the planning department at 
the time. So we did sort of divided the planning

15:26.058 --> 15:30.362
function in areas. The CD area belonging to the 
neighborhood planning group, while the rest of

15:31.203 --> 15:40.131
the area belonging to the comprehensive planning 
group, so to speak. And also the posture of the

15:40.151 --> 15:46.637
comprehensive planning group is we would be also 
responsible for the general planning of the area.

15:50.267 --> 16:09.705
As a result, we would feel like that the 1990 map was 
reasonably successful in identifying the growth

15:50.267 --> 16:09.705
of the city, the growth of actually the metro area 
which covers the ETJ outside the city limit. A lot

16:10.023 --> 16:18.653
of the regional shopping centers did fall within 
very close to the identified location. Now, if you

16:18.713 --> 16:34.090
look at it from today, you might think that the 1990 
map might have dictated the location, but I think

16:18.713 --> 16:34.090
rather than dictating its influence in the 
decision, off the developer to take a better look

16:34.458 --> 16:45.709
at why the department had given that location as a 
regional shopping center or whatever. Does the

16:45.729 --> 16:54.879
department have any plans for doing that sort of 
map again? We did in the mid-70s. worked that 1990

16:59.804 --> 17:03.408
map into a year 2000, okay? And with that, at that 
time, it was partly handing over to me as the

17:04.249 --> 17:13.601
division chief. We feel like that maybe the 
one-page map plus a limited explanation on the

17:14.662 --> 17:22.872
back was not sufficient. We have gone through the 
progression of coming back to look at things a

17:22.892 --> 17:29.440
little bit more closely

17:29.926 --> 17:59.224
so to speak and with the development of some parks 
master plan and so on and so forth and some other

17:29.926 --> 17:59.224
report that has not been published but being used 
in-house we feel like that maybe we should develop

17:29.926 --> 17:59.224
a report that may not be called comprehensive plan 
but we'll have all the comprehensive planning

17:29.926 --> 17:59.224
elements in the report as a result we did publish a 
350-page report called Year 2000 Report. I'm not

18:05.169 --> 18:10.575
sure if you have seen it, but copies were sent... 
Copies were sent to the various planning

18:11.396 --> 18:20.467
libraries and all the public libraries in 
Houston. Now, this one happened to have a cover

18:20.487 --> 18:28.536
that was not printed, but we did... make two prints 
of that, I think each time 1,000 copies. And we have

18:36.843 --> 18:43.512
distributed all of them at the cost of $10 a copy, 
except to public agencies. And in fact, today I

18:43.532 --> 18:51.302
have a request from an individual wanting to buy 
one of these reports. That's why I have it out on my

18:51.322 --> 18:53.686
desk. They want to read it. In fact, I was told that 
TSU used it sort of a reference book for one of the

18:58.857 --> 19:03.722
planning classes.

19:06.606 --> 19:13.914
So in the Houston year 2000 map report, you're 
stressing data rather than maps. Right. Why is

19:14.875 --> 19:15.475
that? We feel like the map would be the one that 
would come out as a composite map called Houston

19:16.817 --> 19:25.266
year 2000 map. And the report is to, I think, to 
really detail the map itself. Detail the map.

19:32.407 --> 19:32.668
Right. And to provide, for example, population 
numbers and projections and so on and so forth. I

19:42.217 --> 19:45.761
think we do have a section on economy at that time. 
And of course, since it's being produced at a time

19:45.881 --> 19:57.332
when the growth was, like you said, very strong,

19:57.683 --> 20:02.048
point out something that is not happening like 
this because the economic downturn. But really,

20:02.068 --> 20:13.900
there have not been that much projected into the 
future, so to speak, even though we call it a year

20:02.068 --> 20:13.900
2000 report. We did identify what may or should, 
would happen in certain areas, but not

20:13.920 --> 20:20.648
everything. Okay. Okay, following up on this is 
that when Ephraim Garcia came to be the department

20:27.046 --> 20:30.950
director. He brought with him an idea that he wants 
to do planning in Houston, which sort of coincides

20:32.511 --> 20:53.131
very strongly with my thinking of philosophy 
about planning in Houston. We understand that we

20:53.171 --> 20:56.074
will not have zoning but zoning is not planning. 
People try to bring that together and confuse the

21:00.287 --> 21:05.935
two things. We, I guess, as professionals, if we 
can call ourselves that, that we need to identify

21:06.075 --> 21:22.739
that zoning is not planning, that zoning is only 
part of two to maybe accomplish a plan and so on. And

21:23.199 --> 21:25.943
so we feel like that maybe we could do 
comprehensive plan for this area here. And we do

21:31.622 --> 21:38.569
feel like that the time has come because of the high 
growth and all the confusion that is generated

21:31.622 --> 21:38.569
through there. And also, I'm sure, the economic 
turn down in Texas. Right. And the timing is

21:43.855 --> 21:48.260
probably quite good at this time for us to do that. 
So we started in Houston to work on a set of first we

21:48.280 --> 21:55.828
wanted everybody to be comfortable with the idea 
of doing climate. So Ephraim Garcia started

22:00.370 --> 22:07.138
talking with a group of area associations. If you 
know what area associations are, they are the

22:07.338 --> 22:16.829
association joined together by developers and 
landowners. For example, there is a city of Post

22:16.849 --> 22:22.116
Oak Association, now it's called Uptown. There's 
a very strong group called West Houston

22:22.156 --> 22:25.900
Association. South Main Center, and so on and so 
forth. At the time, there were about seven area

22:30.784 --> 22:41.055
associations with strong financial backing from 
developers and landowners. Each one of them

22:41.115 --> 22:52.967
really have an executive director who is a 
professional planner and understand what

22:41.115 --> 22:52.967
planning is all about. And they worked very hard to 
bring some of the ideas into the office and into the

22:53.318 --> 23:02.970
area. For example, West Houston has been very 
strong in the area of transportation, which they

23:02.990 --> 23:12.742
feel like they need to have before they even go 
develop the area. So they were very effective.

23:15.125 --> 23:15.385
Jack Lindahl. Wasn't Jack Lindahl involved? Jack 
Lindahl was... Lindahl. Yeah, Jack Lindahl

23:19.270 --> 23:21.132
was... the first executive director for West 
Houston, and then following that, what's his

23:22.242 --> 23:32.654
name, now with Chamber of Commerce.

23:34.476 --> 23:35.797
Where is Jack, though? Jack is now with Bernard 
Johnson, Senior Vice President for Projects and

23:35.817 --> 23:44.567
Planning.

23:46.269 --> 23:48.992
So, just like Uptown Association, which is City of 
Posto now, has John Breeding, who's a classmate

23:49.715 --> 23:57.325
from Texas A&M. And then let's see who else. We do 
have, okay, South Main Center has Marty Reiner,

24:01.831 --> 24:10.463
who's got a Ph.D. in planning, I believe. So we have 
very strong backgrounds going into these area

24:11.865 --> 24:17.713
associations. Ifram saw the opportunity to sort 
of piggyback on their experience and expertise.

24:27.961 --> 24:42.375
We started talking with the area associations, 
asking them to see if they want to do some

24:27.961 --> 24:42.375
comprehensive plans for the areas that they are 
responsible for. We have gotten good response

24:42.395 --> 24:46.840
from them. Five out of seven area associations 
have signed a memorandum of understanding to work

24:47.613 --> 24:52.538
with us. Do you provide them with any kind of 
guidelines? We do. We provide them with

24:58.063 --> 24:59.505
guidelines. In fact, we even provided them with an 
outline of the report that we want to see from them.

25:05.190 --> 25:07.172
Could I get a copy of that? Yes, I'm sure somewhere 
around here we have. Good. The evolution is such.

25:13.246 --> 25:17.250
When we first talk with them, we want them to do the 
report. We want them to identify the boundary of

25:17.271 --> 25:22.396
their study area. We want them to work with one of 
our planners or coordinate, hopefully, between

25:22.757 --> 25:41.818
the various area associations so that one area 
association that identify as something to do may

25:22.757 --> 25:41.818
not negate something that's happening another 
area association. Of course, you know, this is

25:44.028 --> 25:50.556
very similar to what Fort Worth started quite a few 
years ago on their sector planning. It's very

25:50.576 --> 25:51.558
possible. I'm not aware of how they go about 
whether they ask the local group to do it or whether

25:52.218 --> 25:59.869
the planning department does it. Well, the local 
group does it and then it's coordinated with the

25:59.929 --> 26:03.654
professional planning. Okay, that's probably 
what we have in mind from the very beginning. So we

26:10.022 --> 26:10.843
start to go out and sell these ideas to the local 
residents, so to speak. And we have gotten the

26:20.002 --> 26:26.649
attention of local AIA group, APA group, ACME, 
everybody. In fact, when we gotten the signature

26:27.170 --> 26:39.362
of the area associations, either the chairman or 
president or executive director, each time it

26:27.170 --> 26:39.362
generated quite a quite a bit of debate within that 
area association. As a result,

26:44.579 --> 27:00.682
it also generated a lot of debate within the 
professional groups in Houston, and Ephraim and

26:44.579 --> 27:00.682
myself have been to various meetings to explain to 
them what we want to do and how we go about doing it.

27:02.345 --> 27:07.813
The situation is such that there are a number major 
developers that feel like that they do not

27:08.637 --> 27:31.788
understand the process enough or they 
misunderstood that as a forerunner of the

27:08.637 --> 27:31.788
planning department wanting to put more control 
over how development should be carried out and

27:08.637 --> 27:31.788
maybe changing to zoning of the area, so to speak. 
And that sort of really caused everybody to pay

27:33.310 --> 27:38.357
attention to what we were doing. uh the chamber of 
commerce came out at the very beginning as an

27:38.793 --> 28:06.724
opposing to this whole process uh you from 
advanced to various meeting with them finally we

27:38.793 --> 28:06.724
have assured them that that's not what we want to do 
we want to do comprehensive planning we want to

27:38.793 --> 28:06.724
take a look at the present and project into the 
future so that development may be a little bit more

28:07.075 --> 28:28.932
how should i say it orderly so to speak and when the 
growth and development does come back

28:07.075 --> 28:28.932
economically worldwide we can also handle it 
physically so to speak um and one other thing was

28:07.075 --> 28:28.932
one thing i wanted to ask you uh joe um You know, 
assuming that all of these neighborhood groups or

28:29.688 --> 28:49.173
community groups get their plans together and 
they're coordinated, presumably, by

28:29.688 --> 28:49.173
professional planners from the staff, I've 
always referred to that method or that style of

28:29.688 --> 28:49.173
planning as cut-and-paste method. And it was 
tried in Anchorage, Alaska, I think, first of all,

28:50.435 --> 28:58.986
about 19... 56 or 57, and

28:59.675 --> 29:26.172
I perceive some disadvantages to the method, and 
I'm sure you do too, but these can be overcome, and I

28:59.675 --> 29:26.172
suppose that you and Ephraim have discussed this, 
and also I wanted to ask you Once all of these have

29:26.843 --> 29:39.242
been put together and you do have, in fact, a bona 
fide comprehensive plan, then how do you intend to

29:26.843 --> 29:39.242
implement it? Okay. Things have changed since our 
initial conception of how these cut-and-paste

29:40.224 --> 29:49.598
plans were done. Because of the various 
discussions with the professional group with the

29:54.974 --> 30:02.065
developers, with the individuals who are 
interested. We have evolved to a situation where

30:03.267 --> 30:12.582
now the area association will be supporting the 
planning department in doing a sector planning.

30:12.722 --> 30:21.015
We will be dividing up the city and its ETJ into two 
major portions. One portion is still the CD area.

30:26.276 --> 30:30.923
The planning for that area we perceive as slightly 
different from the rest of the area. For CD, we are

30:31.324 --> 30:41.419
really going back into identifying the problem, 
identifying the redevelopment opportunities,

30:31.324 --> 30:41.419
so to speak. And for the rest of the area, we are 
looking at how to cope with new development.

30:52.012 --> 30:58.782
how to support the new development with the 
infrastructure that's needed, with the

30:52.012 --> 30:58.782
transportation system that's needed. So the CD 
areas are really areas that you're essentially

30:59.142 --> 31:06.313
recycling. Right. If you look at the map over 
there, there's a big patch of yellow area, I would

31:07.414 --> 31:21.715
say about 250 square miles that's CD-eligible 
area, and we will be identifying that as a

31:07.414 --> 31:21.715
neighborhood planning area. For the rest of the 
area outside that and inside the ETJ, we will call

31:22.150 --> 31:28.637
it the sector planning area. The sector planning 
area will be...
