00:05.903 --> 00:12.150
This is an interview with Mike Arisco by Stephen 
Huggs in Houston, Texas, 11-5-88. I need

00:12.671 --> 00:25.125
your name, place of birth, location and date for 
Vietnam. Okay, my name is Mike Arisco. I was, at

00:28.449 --> 00:35.877
that time, I was living in Port Opera, graduating 
from Thomas Jefferson in Port Opera. I was in the

00:36.599 --> 00:44.846
United States Marine Corps in 1966 through 69, but 
entered Vietnam in 67 through 69. All right. And

00:46.728 --> 00:48.249
what service organization were you in? Marine 
Corps. In the Marine Corps. And what was your job

00:49.550 --> 00:50.751
specialty? I was 2533 was what my specialty was, 
which is communications. But a lot of times you get

00:56.036 --> 01:00.680
stuck in some of the weirdest jobs while you were 
there. I was with H&S, 3rd Engineers is what I was

01:01.561 --> 01:06.505
working with. Originally, I started out as 
sweeping highways in the morning for landmines.

01:15.102 --> 01:19.328
That's what my original job was, beginning at 
communications. Later took over communications

01:19.348 --> 01:23.334
of the area and then started working. We did toward 
the end of my first tour, then through my next tour

01:23.394 --> 01:31.586
was patrol, working with H&S. Were you 
communication on patrol? No. No, I wasn't. Okay.

01:36.539 --> 01:41.824
When I say no, I wasn't communications. When I 
became a sergeant, I was still part of

01:43.326 --> 01:52.114
communications, but I enjoyed going out more than 
sitting in the Cointree area. I just didn't like

01:52.154 --> 01:53.255
sitting there. I liked taking off. Now, when you 
say communications, just about everybody in our

01:56.338 --> 02:02.044
squad could work the communications. We all took 
turns with it, if that's what you mean. We had a

02:05.227 --> 02:06.428
radio operator. Okay. Okay. All right. And why in 
particular did you choose to fight and be not?

02:12.490 --> 02:13.632
Because I was scared to go to jail. At that time, no 
one wants to go to jail. No one wants to die. But I

02:21.783 --> 02:25.828
felt I was scared, as everybody else was. But I was 
afraid that if I didn't go, I'm going to jail. And I

02:29.893 --> 02:32.397
was more afraid of that. I was more afraid of what 
would happen to me if I didn't go than if I did go.

02:36.402 --> 02:36.482
Hmm. And why did you choose the Marine Corps? 
Because I'm stupid. No, I picked the Marine Corps

02:41.569 --> 02:50.339
because of my personality and the way that I am. I am 
a person who likes to do spontaneous things. When I

02:53.343 --> 03:00.312
entered the Marine Corps, I was fooling, of 
course, with the lower Neanderthal people. Some

03:00.352 --> 03:02.334
of the dumbest things they made us do. But I could 
get away with more. if i if i did not show up for three

03:07.478 --> 03:36.372
days to an area let's say when i when i was in uh when i 
was in the uh san diego let's say when i was

03:07.478 --> 03:36.372
stationed there for a while which was near 
oceanside or wherever i was stationed i'd go meet

03:07.478 --> 03:36.372
some girl be gone for three days and just say i lost 
my way back or i had car trouble and they'll believe

03:07.478 --> 03:36.372
me it was it was unique how ignorance confess your 
own ignorance and but again i also looked at it when

03:36.925 --> 04:05.903
i was in the marine corps we had a tradition we 
didn't leave anybody behind if someone was shot we

03:36.925 --> 04:05.903
didn't leave them we took them back body and all 
sometimes so uh again that's dumb reasons i guess

03:36.925 --> 04:05.903
but that was my reason all right did you receive any 
uh instruction about the country or the nature of

03:36.925 --> 04:05.903
the conflict no that was when i received the 
information Okay, let's start over here. When I

04:08.617 --> 04:14.527
entered the Marine Corps, I spent boot camp, and 
then I went to weapons training. We went to Camp

04:15.549 --> 04:19.776
Pendleton for about six weeks to learn how to use 
certain weapons. There we had maybe a few days of

04:20.498 --> 04:28.111
talking about Vietnam because that's what 
everybody was talking about, but nothing on

04:20.498 --> 04:28.111
Vietnam. It wasn't until I really got into country 
And that, I think, was our major problem. I don't

04:33.210 --> 04:37.234
know if other units did have any indoctrination of 
the country. We didn't. And I think one of our

04:38.235 --> 04:40.797
problems, we never understood the people. And not 
understanding them, we insulted them more than we

04:41.758 --> 04:48.325
ever, by helping them, we insulted them more. One 
example, when you go into a village, when kids run

04:48.806 --> 04:58.035
up to you, you always just say, hey, here's some 
candy. And you're trying to be nice to them when you

04:58.075 --> 05:01.118
know it's a friendly village. At that point, when 
we first walked into a village, we did not know that

05:01.705 --> 05:16.624
before I even stepped into the village, I've 
already insulted everyone in that village four

05:01.705 --> 05:16.624
and five times and never even knew it because I was 
never told of their customs. And I guess you could

05:16.925 --> 05:20.589
say it's the Marine Corps' fault because we're out 
there fighting a war. But again, we lost the

05:20.970 --> 05:22.933
villagers. We never had them on our side. Of 
course, they were more afraid of the enemy. than

05:26.984 --> 05:28.706
they were of us. But like when you enter a village, 
the first person you're supposed to talk to is the

05:28.806 --> 05:34.112
oldest and the elder of the village. Where you 
would stop and say hello to a little kid and you'd

05:34.713 --> 05:40.079
give them candy, you've insulted the oldest 
person in that village. You've insulted the

05:40.099 --> 05:41.561
entire village. Also, touching the top of a 
child's head is very, the top of a child's head in

05:42.202 --> 05:51.793
our area was very, very sacred. And it was like a 
magnet. They said that if you touched the top of a

05:53.114 --> 05:55.337
child's head, it would suck the kindness out of 
their body into your body. And they believed it,

06:00.043 --> 06:03.366
and that's part of their beliefs or their customs. 
So first thing you do is grab a little kid's head and

06:03.386 --> 06:06.489
you shake the, hey, how you doing? You just, to 
those people, you've just taken all the kindness

06:07.089 --> 06:13.174
from that child, and you now own it. And you just 
insulted the family.

06:20.400 --> 06:21.721
Yeah. What is your very first memory of the country 
you were on? The smell. The country stunk. I landed

06:28.319 --> 06:39.432
in Da Nang, is where I first landed, and I was there 
in Da Nang about three days, but the first thing

06:28.319 --> 06:39.432
that I noticed, no, I wasn't there about three 
days, about two days I was in Da Nang. Getting off

06:41.113 --> 06:50.704
the plane, when I was on those little steps coming 
off, the smell, the stench, it smelled like the

06:41.113 --> 06:50.704
whole country was a cesspool. At that time, I did 
not know why, but then I thought everybody in the

06:51.528 --> 06:58.377
country, again, that was my ignorance of not 
knowing the people. Vietnam stunk because It's

07:02.463 --> 07:04.146
rice paddies. It's 90%, at least the areas I was in, 
it's mostly rice paddy and jungle. They use

07:08.553 --> 07:13.962
natural ingredients to fertilize their rice 
paddies. So everything stunk. The people had

07:16.927 --> 07:19.412
different ways of life. Again, the smell was the 
worst, I think. That's the first thing I remember.

07:23.178 --> 07:26.944
I still can smell the, at times, the stench of the 
country. Of course, they could have been burning

07:28.737 --> 07:30.541
Yeah, sure. I thought they could have been burning 
the shitters at that time, you know, the

07:30.902 --> 07:33.608
outhouses. And if they were, you know, the smell 
was going across the tarmac, which was our denang

07:34.189 --> 07:43.529
at that time. Did you at any time feel that South 
Vietnam was too corrupt or corrupt? South Vietnam

07:50.671 --> 07:52.373
could never win the war. We kind of knew that. What 
we wanted was to spend our tour and get out.

08:02.964 --> 08:10.212
The few men that I met, we had an interpreter, and 
over a year we became half-decent friends. He

08:11.133 --> 08:17.880
didn't trust me, and of course a lot of times I 
didn't quite trust him, but we became as best

08:11.133 --> 08:17.880
friends as we could.

08:19.835 --> 08:22.738
He had a brother that he paid to get out of war. 
There's a lot of people that could pay their way out

08:22.958 --> 08:25.281
of the army. Corruption was real, real big. So we 
knew that. And we just knew there's no way that

08:28.684 --> 08:32.208
that... There had to be a revolution to overthrow 
the corruption. So it was just no chance. And did

08:36.312 --> 08:44.140
you ever feel that the Arvin were ineffective 
or... Again, a problem... We had an Arvin. Again,

08:44.240 --> 08:46.102
one of our interpreters was an Arvin. And...

08:50.210 --> 08:54.757
He knew when we went out on patrol that, again, they 
had a different belief. Now, again, this is the

08:56.200 --> 08:57.882
area I was in. Before we get started, I've got to let 
you know, over the years I've found that talking to

08:57.922 --> 09:16.993
other people about Vietnam, what happens to me in 
Vietnam, you can talk to 50 other guys, and all 50

08:57.922 --> 09:16.993
have different interpretations, different 
ideas of Vietnam, even different terrain,

08:57.922 --> 09:16.993
everything, which is so different in areas. So I'm 
giving you what I saw and what I interpreted from

09:17.243 --> 09:21.589
this. The Arvin that I had in my unit,

09:21.609 --> 09:30.621
the first time we fought, you know, we had a small 
engagement. He wanted to run. I mean, he wanted to

09:32.704 --> 09:37.009
run the first thing, and he just knew the moment he 
got up, I would shoot him in the back. He knew that

09:37.290 --> 09:42.897
from the start, that any one of my units was going to 
kill him the moment that he got up to run. I thought

09:43.872 --> 09:44.813
he was a coward. I thought he was an absolute 
coward. And until one day, he's changed me a lot, my

09:47.796 --> 09:57.485
interpretation of Vietnam because he showed me 
their point of view, which was so different from

09:47.796 --> 09:57.485
mine. One day we were sitting there talking and I 
said, you know, I can't believe I'm in your country

09:58.166 --> 10:05.313
fighting for you and you're nothing but a bunch of 
cowards always running. And he got a little upset

10:06.955 --> 10:11.179
with me and he said, you are a a visitor in our 
country you're here to help us but you're so wrong

10:11.547 --> 10:35.479
and he he was very angry he told me he said you you 
marines up here uh brag about having the ten to one

10:11.547 --> 10:35.479
kill ratio in other words uh they'd say that our 
units up in the north had ten to one ratio would kill

10:11.547 --> 10:35.479
ten of the enemy before they finally kill us which 
is a very high high ratio and he said that means And I

10:35.898 --> 10:37.440
call it the John Wayne theory. The John Wayne 
theory is you fight to the end and you die a hero. He

10:41.765 --> 10:45.590
turned and he said, you know, that idea is totally 
stupid. He said, why do you do it that way? All you

10:48.333 --> 10:52.458
want to do is you shoot one today and you run. And you 
shoot one tomorrow and you run. And in one year, you

10:56.744 --> 11:01.770
have just killed 365 people. and I'm still alive, 
what is the ratio then? 365 to one compared to your

11:04.421 --> 11:07.090
10 to one. So they had a different idea about what is 
war. War to us was fight to the John Wayne, the

11:11.504 --> 11:15.557
Alamo, fight to the end. where they had an idea that 
you hit and you run. If you get into a situation

11:19.117 --> 11:22.380
where you think you're going to be surrounded, get 
out. But you're still allowed to fight another

11:22.901 --> 11:27.987
day, where we will sit there and keep fighting. So 
it's different ideas. I think their type of

11:29.849 --> 11:35.014
fighting could not, we could not work together. If 
that's what you mean by the arm, they could not

11:35.155 --> 11:39.339
fight with us because we had different theories. 
Guerrilla fighting or in the jungle fighting,

11:39.860 --> 11:42.202
perfect. But we did not fight that way, and that was 
the difference. Did you ever actually conduct a

11:45.406 --> 11:48.310
small unit action or any action? Oh, yeah, yeah, 
yeah. As I showed you earlier, going into Khe Sanh

11:50.913 --> 11:56.820
was the biggest joke. We thought we knew we died at 
Khe Sanh. It was a... And we walked right into it. A

12:04.409 --> 12:08.754
story out of Khe Sanh.

12:08.774 --> 12:10.877
1-9, there was nothing left of 1-9 or 2. 2-9 was just 
chopped up. There were areas they talked about,

12:14.583 --> 12:28.577
and I never saw this area, but they were talking 
about at night when you set up your concertina

12:14.583 --> 12:28.577
wire, you put cans of rocks in it, or you put a piece 
of metal into the concertina wire to where someone

12:14.583 --> 12:28.577
touches a rattle. You make noises, and you tell 
what the enemy is there touching the wire. Some of

12:32.221 --> 12:33.683
those nights, it got so dark. You couldn't see, and 
you kept asking for flares, but after a while, the

12:33.983 --> 12:40.810
enemy then sees you, so you can't put too many 
flares out. They said one of the sides during this

12:42.038 --> 12:47.565
time period, at night it got so dark they couldn't 
see. The next morning when the sun came up, they

12:47.585 --> 13:03.945
noticed that all the hands were taken off and 
little white crosses were placed in that

12:47.585 --> 13:03.945
position, saying that the enemy got into the 
concertina wire, made no noise, showed that they

12:47.585 --> 13:03.945
could have crossed into the wire any time they 
wanted to. Personally, I was too scared to believe

13:04.870 --> 13:06.873
something like that. I'm saying, God, if they 
could do that, then why are we still here? I mean,

13:09.957 --> 13:12.661
they were really pounding the hell out of us. It 
felt like you couldn't sleep at night. You tried

13:16.786 --> 13:17.587
the best. You would sleep for maybe, it felt like 30 
seconds because a shell was coming in almost that

13:17.607 --> 13:21.953
often. It was just constant pounding. But I guess 
we're, as Marines, we're just too stupid to give

13:24.477 --> 13:27.441
up. But one of the guys in a unit got his flight back. 
It's the day that you have to report to the name,

13:34.722 --> 13:38.968
you're going home. And he's in the middle of, right 
in the middle of Khe Sanh, surrounded by, we

13:39.369 --> 13:47.240
thought, the entire Asian population was around 
us, because hell, we were totally surrounded. We

13:48.702 --> 13:52.388
started laughing at him, that you ain't going 
home, mother, you're going to die right here. We

13:53.509 --> 13:54.831
laughed at him for about a day. It must have been the 
second day this idiot stood up, took his helmet

13:56.734 --> 14:01.641
off, We have what they call little Volkswagens. We 
call them a mule. They're like little

14:04.930 --> 14:06.994
Volkswagens. They took all the parts of them and 
made a flat bed across them. You had one place to

14:09.278 --> 14:12.203
steer it and carry things on it. He stood up on a mule 
and he just hollered out to the wire, people, I

14:12.223 --> 14:17.652
quit. I'm putting my rifle down. I'm putting my 
helmet down. I am not fighting anymore. I am going

14:22.280 --> 14:23.342
home. Okay? He gets in the mule. And he takes off, he 
puts some mail on the back behind this mule. He

14:34.503 --> 14:39.529
takes off to Dong Ha, which is right next to Quang 
Tri, going home. When he left, he snuck out. He just

14:42.472 --> 14:45.375
didn't just, you know, everybody watched him and 
waved at him, but he snuck out. We knew when he got

14:45.836 --> 14:49.179
out, you know, we'd never see that mother again. 
He's going to be just dead meat somewhere. About

14:52.465 --> 14:55.030
four hours later, he calls from Quang Tri. Nobody 
stopped him. He just saw no one the entire

14:56.734 --> 14:58.758
distance. Again, the Vietnamese believe that 
people that are crazy are sacred. Anybody crazy

15:06.333 --> 15:11.824
enough to go through three divisions of North 
Vietnamese regulars Got to be crazy. And he made it

15:14.028 --> 15:15.009
all the way back. You know, nuts like, things like 
that always happen. You know, you wonder. You

15:18.872 --> 15:21.335
know, everybody then started saying, people, I 
give up. You know, but it didn't work after they

15:21.395 --> 15:26.339
kept pounding the hell out of it. All right. What 
was the typical action you would describe that you

15:27.821 --> 15:33.366
were involved in as a, in those later periods as a 
patrol? Okay. I classify Vietnam as two wars. You

15:37.750 --> 15:41.153
have a good war and then you have a bad war. About, I 
would say, 66 through 69, it was a good war. Maybe

15:46.720 --> 15:48.563
even kind of 70, if you want to. It was to where the 
American public was not that much against it.

15:52.589 --> 15:54.432
People over there were still fighting the war.

15:57.517 --> 16:00.020
I was there during that time period. The bad war is 
the time period where People coming over were the

16:06.597 --> 16:18.017
protesters, the people that did not, of course, 
nobody wanted to be there, but these were the ones

16:06.597 --> 16:18.017
that were picketing and fighting against the war. 
So their patrols, I heard about, you know, smoking

16:19.400 --> 16:25.270
grass, going on patrol, most of the guys would die. 
I would be really afraid to have been over there

16:25.811 --> 16:29.618
during the 70s because of how... Sloppy, real 
sloppy, these people were. I always heard, you

16:35.370 --> 16:39.716
know, these guys that talk afterwards about being 
heroes. You know, there's no hero in Vietnam. All

16:41.418 --> 16:44.502
it was is a bunch of guys that try to stay alive. Some 
of them did some of the weirdest things by being

16:44.842 --> 16:47.525
heroes. But anyway, the Enormous Patrol for us was 
very easygoing. We worked together very well. the

16:57.053 --> 17:21.964
four guys that I was with some of my I call every so 
often but I've not seen him since we left since I've

16:57.053 --> 17:21.964
left Vietnam or they left also of course I didn't 
ask you I didn't answer your question too well

16:57.053 --> 17:21.964
other typical action what was it like you mean 
going on patrol yeah most of the times we had a

16:57.053 --> 17:21.964
three-day patrol four-day patrol you're really 
going for us a lot of times we were just out seeing

17:23.733 --> 17:52.626
what's out there and if you're talking about 
different types we had a patrol you'd go out past

17:23.733 --> 17:52.626
the wire for a few days just checking to see what's 
or even one day you're going out just see what's out

17:23.733 --> 17:52.626
there and coming back you had other ones where we 
would have to go to vanden grift or to any place like

17:23.733 --> 17:52.626
that where you just take off and put it all the way 
there

17:23.733 --> 17:52.626
gosh i wish i could in the jungle was uh The most 
frightening of them all to me. The jungle was scary

17:56.425 --> 17:59.289
because you couldn't see ahead of them. It was so 
hot. There's no sun. The humidity just drained the

18:01.212 --> 18:03.976
energy out of you. The heat was just terrible. But 
you couldn't see. That was a big thing. You were

18:08.483 --> 18:09.304
walking along. You had to be so quiet because you 
make any noise, those people can almost walk 20

18:09.324 --> 18:16.594
feet away from you, and you will never even see 
them. You'll only hear or smell them. Same way for

18:18.457 --> 18:19.398
our direction. Typical action. Let's see if I can 
give one. We took three days, or two days of

18:23.504 --> 18:27.269
C-rations, or three days, we were out for three 
days. We used C-rations or K-rations, which

18:27.709 --> 18:34.698
tasted like, you know, 20-year-old vomit. And we 
couldn't heat it up. We had to eat it cold, which

18:37.100 --> 18:39.103
made it even taste worse. But you were so hot and so 
drained of fluid, you really didn't want to eat

18:39.824 --> 18:45.150
anything. All you wanted to do was take down the 
liquids. God, I... I wish I could help you more on

18:52.495 --> 18:55.679
it, but that's just when we'd go out on patrols. We 
were scared. Of course, there are fun times. I

18:59.845 --> 19:01.347
mean, there's a weird time, too. Now, that's what I 
like to remember, the weird times. You'll get out,

19:05.252 --> 19:08.837
and you'll have these monkeys. We call them rock 
apes. They'll throw rocks at you. You're sitting

19:12.362 --> 19:14.505
down there on the ground, not bothering anybody. 
Also, you have these things thrown at you from, we

19:14.885 --> 19:18.330
call them rock apes. They'll throw anything they 
can get their hands on. to get you out of their area.

19:22.487 --> 19:23.668
They thought that was their area. And idiots like 
us, instead of shooting them, we throw rocks back

19:24.469 --> 19:27.773
at them. And then you have a firefight between 
monkeys and marines over their little area. There

19:34.160 --> 19:36.222
was a time where we went after a bingo tiger. I 
showed you the picture, didn't I? I didn't shoot

19:39.966 --> 19:40.767
it. Some guy shot a... We went out on patrol to kill a 
bingo tiger. There was like an operation of

19:46.393 --> 19:48.135
maybe... Four or five hundred went out on a hunt of 
this rabid bingo tiger. It was told whoever got it

19:53.499 --> 19:56.204
could keep it. It was their skin. They could take 
the skin home. A Marine shot it with an M16, one shot

20:01.934 --> 20:06.562
by total accident. The guy said he was just 
shooting in the area and the tiger ran into the

20:06.582 --> 20:09.988
bullet. But he hit him right in the head, just blew 
the top of his head off. Well, they drug it back,

20:13.572 --> 20:21.381
they hooked it up in the camp, they hooked it on a 
telephone pole, and let's sit there like an honor,

20:13.572 --> 20:21.381
like this is what we got. Found out the next day it's 
rabbits. So the colonel of our company found out

20:27.088 --> 20:33.295
that we have to burn it. What you have to do to a 
rabbit animal out there is you dig a hole, you bury

20:33.335 --> 20:38.541
it, You dig a hole first, then you cover it with 
gasoline, you burn it, pour lye on it, then you bury

20:38.977 --> 20:45.986
it, and you don't get away from that area for a 
while. That's what they did. But our colonel

20:48.309 --> 20:49.130
didn't. 101 Airborne just moved up right next to 
us. We never saw stakes. We never had T-bone

20:55.359 --> 20:56.680
stakes. They did. Their colonel said, God, I wish I 
had that skin because, man, that's a beautiful

20:59.444 --> 21:06.854
thing to take home, to lay on the ground, to say 
that, you know, he'd probably go home and say he

20:59.444 --> 21:06.854
shot it himself, you know. Who in the hell would 
know? So our colonel, knowing it's rabbit, said,

21:08.558 --> 21:16.268
I'll tell you what, the guy, the boy doesn't want 
the skin at all, or the animal. He gave it to me. I'll

21:17.770 --> 21:25.379
tell you what, if you give me one of your bins full of 
steaks to feed my guys, we'll give you the skin. The

21:25.399 --> 21:27.181
guy said, hey, great, we'll do that. So he takes the 
steaks that he was going to give to his own

21:27.442 --> 21:37.975
servicemen, the Army, which hell, they get them 
all the time, gave them to us. He has, we call them

21:39.203 --> 21:43.710
like ditzy dumpsters, or big metal containers of 
refrigeration. Well, he only had one

21:44.071 --> 21:51.202
refrigerator left with the steaks that the guys 
were going to eat for the rest of the month, which is

21:44.071 --> 21:51.202
mostly ground meat and stuff like this. So he 
throws that carcass into that, their other

21:51.903 --> 22:01.077
refrigerator, waiting until someone processes 
the skin, okay? So he called over his doctors. We

22:03.226 --> 22:05.709
already had this big, ditzy dumpster with steaks. 
We had a fantastic barbecue. We just, we ate and

22:07.932 --> 22:15.982
ate, because we had email, because we knew that as 
soon as he found out that that thing is rabid, that

22:07.932 --> 22:15.982
we, okay, to the Army. Great steaks. He had to, the 
funny part, this is what I heard, I don't know if it

22:19.706 --> 22:31.080
was true or not, but I heard that the colonel was so 
embarrassed, their colonel, was so embarrassed

22:19.706 --> 22:31.080
that he was being snookered by a Marine colonel 
that he couldn't tell everybody that the thing was

22:31.887 --> 22:35.370
rabid. He just snuck out and burned it. But he put it 
in with this meat, which contaminated the meat. He

22:40.194 --> 22:42.977
was so embarrassed by it, he didn't want to tell 
anybody he did do that. So he let the guys eat the

22:43.337 --> 22:47.240
meat, you know, that was then contaminated. But 
who knows? They could have done that. That's

22:49.042 --> 22:52.565
normal.

22:52.625 --> 22:55.027
How would you analyze the progress of the war while 
you were there? There was no progress.

22:59.411 --> 23:00.392
When I got there, All I saw when I got there, the 
progress to me was the building up of Quang Tri.

23:07.374 --> 23:13.683
When I entered Vietnam, I was stationed with the 
3rd Marine Division, and they just moved up. They

23:15.145 --> 23:16.688
were first, I think, in Dong Ha. I wasn't there yet. 
Dong Ha is a little farther north than Quang Tri.

23:21.114 --> 23:24.359
And they were from the other side of the DMZ. They 
could rocket to Dong Ha. So it's It was a little too

23:27.035 --> 23:32.483
close to the north, so I think they wanted to build a 
base a little farther south where rockets won't

23:27.035 --> 23:32.483
hit it. Dong Ha base was still there, but they moved 
down to Quang Tri. When I got there, they were just

23:36.749 --> 23:39.313
starting to build Quang Tri up. We went from tents 
to – now, this army wasn't there yet, so we were

23:40.796 --> 23:49.709
stealing plywood and things from the Seabees or 
whatever we need stuff from. So we built – within

23:49.729 --> 23:53.194
the first year, we had wooden tents – you know, the 
size of me out of wood, things like this that we got

23:53.647 --> 24:00.717
from the Seabees or whatever we could steal from 
other people. But that's the money field. I saw no

24:02.439 --> 24:09.569
advancement except you go out on patrol one day, 
you hit a village the next day, you go back, the

24:02.439 --> 24:09.569
village is, you know, taken over again. We didn't 
gain anything. I never thought we ever gained

24:11.992 --> 24:13.474
land. I never saw it gain. I just saw us lose. Or you 
go into a village, you know they're scared. You

24:20.323 --> 24:22.626
know that you can tell that they're scared. 
They... They tell you there's no one there, and you

24:23.819 --> 24:29.347
know there is, but you know that when you leave that 
village, they're going to move back in. And we

24:29.727 --> 24:31.189
lived in that village. They'd help us if we lived in 
the village, but then we would be gone, and we

24:31.229 --> 24:37.138
didn't see Viet Cong at all. We fought straight 
North Vietnamese rebels. We knew they were going

24:40.703 --> 24:46.030
to come back and live in that village, so they were 
more afraid of them than they were of us.

24:53.924 --> 25:19.780
do you feel the policies guiding the world the war 
were too vague or inconsistent with actually what

24:53.924 --> 25:19.780
was going on oh yeah uh that made it difficult to uh 
the policy we i didn't know if we had a policy in

24:53.924 --> 25:19.780
vietnam except go over and just a lot of times i 
blame west marlin i blame uh i don't know if i'd

24:53.924 --> 25:19.780
blame johnson because i don't think johnson i 
think it was allowed to that's how i really feel i

24:53.924 --> 25:19.780
feel that the army and not the Army lied to him, I 
think that the CIA came up with a lot of situations

25:20.215 --> 25:31.393
that did not,

25:20.215 --> 25:31.393
were not true. When Westmoreland came up and said, 
we need 50,000 men and we can do this, and so he gives

25:32.815 --> 25:39.947
them 50,000 men and says, we're a little wrong, we 
need another 50,000. The escalation of war, a lot

25:40.267 --> 25:43.973
of people blame Johnson for the escalation. I 
don't, I just think that he was going along with

25:44.053 --> 25:47.539
what he was trusting, his advisors, and I think his 
advisors were all wrong with what they were doing

25:48.329 --> 25:53.456
in the policy. You don't believe me? He was part of 
the naval pump. Your teacher was part of the...

25:59.325 --> 25:59.665
Right. He served as a gunner out on the ship. Okay. 
My one time with the Navy, I've got to tell you this

26:02.850 --> 26:08.137
one. When you call in fire support, We call in fire 
support by calling our rear or having a frequency

26:10.503 --> 26:16.032
to go to. And our frequency is mostly a 105 howitzer 
or a 155 howitzer. And that's what mostly we got

26:21.060 --> 26:22.903
sometimes. And when you call it in, they check your 
coordinates to make sure they're not in a friendly

26:23.324 --> 26:28.473
area. Then they'll ask for smoke. And they'll send 
one round. And sometimes you're hit so hard, you

26:34.417 --> 26:37.661
say, forget the smoke. Just come in with it, 
because we're really being hit. And sometimes

26:40.465 --> 26:41.346
they do. But sometimes it's like a grab bag. You're 
knowing you're going to get 105s or 155s, but you

26:45.291 --> 26:48.775
don't know what else you're going to get. We were 
out. And this was about 6.30 in the evening, just

26:51.919 --> 26:55.083
starting dust. We can see them moving around. We 
were near a rice pad. what they call scrub brush.

27:01.578 --> 27:03.122
There's a lot of this stuff around. We can see there 
must have been about 30 or 40 of them out there. At

27:05.346 --> 27:08.473
least for us it felt like 5,000, but there's only a 
few. They looked like they were trying to surround

27:10.197 --> 27:14.506
us, but we wanted to hit them, so we called in for 
support. What we were hoping for was a jet or a

27:15.167 --> 27:18.715
helicopter to come in because They're easier to 
work with because they're right there on top of

27:19.015 --> 27:21.998
you. But you get mostly 105s and 155s. So we called 
in, and the guy on the radio was calling in our

27:27.223 --> 27:32.207
coordinates. And he said he kept hollering at this 
guy. And we said, what do you got? He says, I can't

27:36.932 --> 27:41.916
tell where this guy is, but he sounds like he is 
5,000 miles away. He's talking so far away from his

27:41.976 --> 27:44.539
mic. May I have this? He was talking so far away from

27:46.184 --> 27:53.895
the mic. We couldn't understand what he meant by 
that. This guy said, just give me your

27:56.799 --> 28:00.504
coordinates. We gave him the coordinates, and he 
said, I'm going to drop smoke. I will wait, and then

28:04.409 --> 28:07.473
tell me if you want to fire for effect. That must 
have been, oh, a few minutes later. We looked up,

28:13.572 --> 28:16.997
and in my mind I said, where's the train? Because it 
sounded like a locomotive coming over. And all of a

28:20.402 --> 28:23.688
sudden, the whole ground just shook. And he said, 
fire! And the guy on the bus just thought he meant

28:28.555 --> 28:31.900
fire for effect. And he put three shells. It was New 
Jersey. He put three shells. All we were doing was

28:37.906 --> 28:39.367
ruining it. We thought the world came to an end. I 
did not know shells get that big. We got about, oh,

28:45.113 --> 28:53.682
we must have ran, it felt like for days, but I mean, 
we ran for a couple hundred yards, laid back, and we

28:45.113 --> 28:53.682
said, God, we don't want that anymore. They should 
have said, we're the New Jersey. Please be a bit

28:56.504 --> 28:57.806
advised. You're going to get a train coming over 
your head, and we're going to blow up an entire grid

28:57.826 --> 29:01.990
coordinate for you. That was the only time, and I 
think after that we got real gunshot, but I never

29:01.970 --> 29:09.099
called anything in because we were afraid we'd get 
to New Jersey again. God, I mean, that is the most

29:09.360 --> 29:13.645
powerful shot we have ever, I've ever had. He was on 
me in New Jersey. Thank you for letting me shit in my

29:15.808 --> 29:22.096
pants.

29:22.116 --> 29:24.599
All right. Did you see any atrocities or war 
crimes? No. No, I didn't see any. Wait a minute,

29:30.047 --> 29:30.687
wait a minute. Let's take this back a minute. Wait a 
minute. If you mean by atrocities, no, I saw no

29:32.243 --> 29:38.137
atrocities. I heard of some. For instance, that's 
what I was going to try to get to. I don't know if

29:43.549 --> 29:48.882
that's considered the same. I heard of a guy going 
down in a... Picking up the enemy, having three of

29:51.683 --> 29:56.869
them in the back of a... We never had these 
beautiful trucks. We always had dump trucks or a

29:56.929 --> 29:59.853
deuce and a half. We never had the beautiful cars or 
the beautiful trucks with the covers on the back

29:59.873 --> 30:04.818
and the beautiful seats. The Army had that. We had 
nothing. When you pick up three guys or three of the

30:07.802 --> 30:13.068
enemy that you've caught, you don't want them to 
talk. I've heard of them guys that would take them

30:14.009 --> 30:18.855
and tie their hands together, throw them off the 
back of the truck. And just drag them. And then when

30:21.126 --> 30:24.631
you have nothing left of the guys with these arms, 
then you say, next. And they say, by that time, the

30:25.152 --> 30:27.335
guys are talking. You know, find out where the 
enemy is. I don't know if that's true. I never saw

30:29.798 --> 30:30.940
it. I've always heard about stuff like that. And 
you say, yay for the good guys. You let them drag

30:34.545 --> 30:35.726
them a while. But that's it.

30:40.513 --> 30:42.956
Do you feel your involvement in the war was the 
right thing to do?

30:45.900 --> 30:46.581
Wow. Hindsight is great sight. At the time, I 
thought I was fighting for God, mom, and apple pie.

30:57.825 --> 30:59.467
That, I really believe. I still believe today, 
I've got to, or I would... Everything that I did was

30:59.487 --> 31:10.278
actually worthless if I don't believe that I 
fought for the United States and for what I really

30:59.487 --> 31:10.278
believed in. But it gets tougher to look at it that 
way. I believe the war was... was wrong. At the

31:19.027 --> 31:29.337
time, what we wanted to do was turn the whole 
country into glass, just nuke it and make it into

31:19.027 --> 31:29.337
another Disney world for the future generations. 
But I personally today look back and say I don't

31:30.919 --> 31:35.964
think we should have been there. But at the time, I 
have to believe that I was there for a cause.

31:39.467 --> 31:40.648
Because at that time, it was a good war. It wasn't a 
bad war yet. So we still believe it was a good war.

31:45.353 --> 31:46.034
That's your question? Oh, yeah. Let's see. So 
we've been reading materials that bring to light

31:48.933 --> 32:07.893
the fact that South Vietnam was so permeated with 
corruption and civil dissent that the VC or the

31:48.933 --> 32:07.893
National Liberation Front were in such firm 
control that there was basically nothing that

31:48.933 --> 32:07.893
could have been done. Do you believe this is true, 
that no amount of aid, men, troops, unified

32:14.092 --> 32:17.166
national action from the union or anything could 
have prevented? THE PRESIDENT. No, Vietnam was,

32:18.090 --> 32:21.486
the country was wrong. I don't know if it was our 
foreign policy, which I think it was. It wasn't the

32:25.133 --> 32:31.601
military fault, since you're an ADM, I can't have 
to say it that way. It really was not the military,

32:31.721 --> 32:36.887
because they fought with the politicians and made 
them fight. And that's sad. That type of war should

32:39.050 --> 32:41.633
never happen again. And it's not the war, it's that 
letting politicians fight a war. And I think

32:45.278 --> 32:46.800
that's what happened. We went into a country that 
the politicians absolutely corrupted. We

32:51.065 --> 32:53.469
destroyed their economy. We destroyed their 
self-image. We destroyed everything that one

32:54.971 --> 33:00.839
country could destroy on another country. And we 
did it for the sake of democracy. And that was not

33:03.503 --> 33:06.147
the military that did it mostly. It was the 
politicians at the time, and our own politicians,

33:06.167 --> 33:11.595
trying to make a buck. Some of us, not politicians, 
but some of our company owners of big industries

33:11.896 --> 33:20.869
was making a lot of money off this war. They'll do 
any calls. But there was no hope for Vietnam.

33:23.759 --> 33:27.022
Vietnam never, ever had a chance. What was your 
homecoming like? Bad.

33:33.008 --> 33:35.431
By the time I got home, oh, wait, let me tell you 
about home. I entered, when I left Vietnam, I

33:36.712 --> 33:44.360
entered Da Nang. When we go home, we get flight 
dates. You give up your gun, you give up most of your

33:46.904 --> 33:58.641
stuff, you give all that up at your units, and then 
you fly in by helicopter, for us by helicopter,

33:46.904 --> 33:58.641
into Da Nang, and you wait for your flight date, 
which is that day. What happened to us was a

33:59.402 --> 34:02.166
situation. We entered, when I left home, when I was 
coming home in 69, a typhoon just finished hitting

34:02.226 --> 34:12.481
Da Nang, or Vietnam. Another one just went over 
okinawa now how marines go home everything stays

34:14.528 --> 34:42.207
through okinawa so and okinawa had a treaty that's 
only a certain amount of servicemen will be on

34:14.528 --> 34:42.207
their country at any time so they had a backlog and 
they had not only they had too many people on

34:14.528 --> 34:42.207
okinawa because of the typhoon because they had to 
stop flights and they had so many waiting in denain

34:42.457 --> 34:45.501
waiting for those people to leave Okinawa where we 
could fly out. I was in Da Nang like three days

34:45.521 --> 34:48.505
waiting for an airplane. We were getting 
frustrated. We had no rifle. We were getting

34:51.849 --> 34:55.474
shelled about every other day, which is only three 
days, but we got shelled. We had no protection

34:56.595 --> 35:07.890
except we were inside of these big cement sewer 
holes that they used to make bunkers out of. We'd

35:08.039 --> 35:12.303
run into it and we were scared to hell because we 
were going home and that's the worst time to be. So

35:12.864 --> 35:16.648
by the time I got my date to leave, I flew into 
Okinawa. Now Okinawa, we had a problem too now.

35:18.870 --> 35:25.857
We're there and they said, hey, you're going to be 
here for at least a week because we're trying to

35:18.870 --> 35:25.857
find any way to get servicemen home. Well, 
eventually, what I got on was 12 of us. We just got

35:31.582 --> 35:32.403
the first day. First day I entered Okinawa. We 
found a hole in the fence. They would not give us

35:36.722 --> 35:40.889
liberty because we're not part of that unit. We're 
just staging areas going from one spot to another.

35:43.713 --> 35:44.675
So we couldn't have liberty. So we're going to be 
three days in this place. So the first day, we made

35:47.779 --> 35:51.024
sure we found a hole in the fence. We found a... a 
social house that is in Okinawa. Of course, we had

35:55.878 --> 35:58.525
alcohol and this type of thing. The next night, I 
did not want to go out. Those guys just took off the

36:01.432 --> 36:04.741
same hole in the fence, you know, hey, another 
social night. I stayed And I got a private flight

36:07.895 --> 36:10.057
home. We found a, there was a commercial flight 
going through Okinawa. And they said, they've got

36:13.942 --> 36:16.765
five, 20 seats open. Any of you five want to go, you 
know, get your stuff and meet. Boy, I mean, we dove

36:19.748 --> 36:21.410
for that area. It landed in Los Angeles, which 
meant it was not a military pickup. Now, it sounded

36:25.574 --> 36:28.938
great to do it that way, but now I'm stuck in the 
middle of Los Angeles. And I had to find the closest

36:29.599 --> 36:34.204
base, which was El Toro, which is in California. 
Then it became a joke. Some officer, it had to be an

36:36.667 --> 36:50.361
officer, I hope the teacher wasn't an officer, 
some idiot came up with a beautiful idea that

36:36.667 --> 36:50.361
servicemen, Marines coming back from Vietnam 
were animals. So they were going to spend three

36:51.202 --> 37:01.273
days to a week bringing us back into the social life 
of the United States. all we want to do is go home we

37:01.962 --> 37:25.793
wanted to be out and one day get my uh because i was i 
was out of service i was going back to go to college i

37:01.962 --> 37:25.793
was i was uh i'm out i'm on home we'll go i want to go 
home but he said nope we're going to spend a week

37:01.962 --> 37:25.793
putting you back into society so they take us to 
places like uh disneyland and we have to walk in or

37:01.962 --> 37:25.793
we're in That was the most embarrassing. We went to 
Disneyland in uniform, and we had to march into

37:27.960 --> 37:31.966
Disneyland. We had to stand and ride and march, 
which caused havoc among these guys that want to go

37:32.026 --> 37:39.316
home. The whole idea did not work. I don't know how 
long they tried to do this, but it didn't work. We

37:47.046 --> 37:48.609
got into Pirates of the Caribbean. You put 40 guys 
on a ride going into a place you don't want to be. Uh,

37:55.743 --> 37:57.505
guys were jumping from boat to boat. They were, uh, 
jumping up, changing the, uh, the hand signs. You

38:01.649 --> 38:06.373
know, a guy had, in the parts of the Caribbean, you 
got these guys moving around, you know,

38:01.649 --> 38:06.373
animation. And they would jump off one boat, you 
know, little bitty carts you're supposed to be in

38:06.393 --> 38:16.883
in the water, jump off, change the hand where 
instead of waving, it is showing the, uh, great

38:06.393 --> 38:16.883
American bird. Uh, they stopped the ride in the 
middle, made us get off, told us to get out of the

38:17.964 --> 38:24.130
park that we were very, very, oh, man, there's a 
lieutenant over us. just reamed us out, but we got

38:24.110 --> 38:28.616
to go home to them. It was a total flop, but that's 
what they tried to do. When I finally got home, I

38:30.558 --> 38:34.363
went back to school. It wasn't fun. I went to Lamar, 
which compared to your college is not much, but it

38:36.005 --> 38:41.492
was my college to go to. I had a sociology teacher 
that called me a baby killer into class. He

38:47.700 --> 38:48.941
embarrassed me very much. He tried to as much as he 
went. By this time, the war was getting bad.

38:54.890 --> 39:04.747
When we entered, there's like 12 of us that I knew 
that was in Lamar, and they would call us on the

38:54.890 --> 39:04.747
phone saying, don't show up today to school. 
There's going to be a protest, and we don't want you

39:04.827 --> 39:07.272
to cause a problem. It didn't happen very often, 
but I kept saying to myself, why are you getting mad

39:08.333 --> 39:13.663
at me? I went to defend the United States, and 
you're taking it out on me, and I didn't, you know. I

39:20.337 --> 39:21.158
didn't shoot you. I didn't shoot at you. Why are you 
getting that at me for? And that's how a lot of us, we

39:23.081 --> 39:26.025
felt very frustrated and very angry. Of course, 
the sweetheart of sweethearts today is Jane

39:28.248 --> 39:31.793
Fonda. Anything to do with Jane Fonda, I will 
absolutely, positively protest. If she came to

39:38.183 --> 39:47.316
town or went to, had anything in Foley's or any 
place that I have credit cards, I will let them know

39:38.183 --> 39:47.316
that if they sell that item, I will burn that card. I 
will not have anything to do with that company. To

39:50.442 --> 39:57.773
me, protesting is different than going to another 
person's country and saying how bad we are. That's

39:58.674 --> 40:00.777
unforgivable.

40:02.359 --> 40:05.544
That's what things have happened to me. Where were 
you during the test? It depends. I was there for two

40:08.888 --> 40:09.750
tests. One I was a case on. Looking back, I'm glad I 
was at Khe Sanh compared to Way. I mean, it was

40:19.333 --> 40:22.676
either probably my luck out of the top that I had to 
go on the way. And Way was a woolly booker. Of

40:26.219 --> 40:28.502
course, again, we had it tough. But you're 
fighting, I mean, street by street and bunker by

40:28.522 --> 40:36.109
bunker. Those guys really had to me had a tough 
time. Of course, we were getting shelled. We knew

40:40.113 --> 40:42.235
we died. Wade was tough. There's a lot of them that 
was really bad. The next one was in 68.

40:51.849 --> 40:52.930
And it wasn't as bad. I just remember getting 
shelled a little. But it wasn't, I don't remember

40:55.134 --> 41:01.543
that much about that pet at all except we just 
prepared for it and it wasn't as big as we thought it

40:55.134 --> 41:01.543
would be. Where were you for that one? I don't 
remember. I must have been out on patrol. I must

41:05.910 --> 41:06.991
have been in Cointree. It wasn't, it did not hit me 
to remember, so it must not have been that

41:10.615 --> 41:15.783
important, because I don't remember that much 
about that. How did you change during your time in

41:16.524 --> 41:19.649
Vietnam? I grew up. I was a little kid. Being from a 
small town like Port Opera, and with one high

41:25.237 --> 41:32.168
school, all white, All you did was, you know, the 
biggest problem you had at school when I was

41:33.565 --> 41:42.021
growing up in high school was who I was going to, 
what girl I was going to take out that weekend.

41:43.323 --> 41:46.309
Making sure dad would have enough gasoline in my 
car. It was a small town, and the beach is only 25

41:46.409 --> 41:51.378
miles away. We were at the beach in the summer, so it 
was really a very easygoing life. I learned a lot. I

41:58.334 --> 42:00.738
learned a lot about people when I was in Vietnam. I 
learned that I am not right. I am just, even if I, my

42:03.782 --> 42:09.469
ideas are not always right. But they might not be 
wrong either. It's just someone else has a

42:10.851 --> 42:12.593
different idea. I grew up a lot. Being honest, I 
kind of, if of course I don't have a son, I've got a

42:14.436 --> 42:18.201
daughter. And I've always said that if I had to do it 
all over again, or not all over again, if I had a son,

42:25.220 --> 42:33.838
I would want him, before he went into college, he 
should either enter a military institution or a

42:25.220 --> 42:33.838
military academy. I don't mean like A&M, going to 
school at A&M. I'm talking about core. If he said,

42:40.252 --> 42:44.922
OK, Dad, I want to go to a college, he'd have to enter 
one with a core. He has to learn. to grow up, but I

42:46.870 --> 42:50.775
believe the military does help. Some people 
don't, but it did me, and I'm very happy that they

42:50.835 --> 42:56.843
did that for me. It also paid for my education. It 
taught me how to lie and get away with it. Did you

43:03.152 --> 43:15.308
find while you were there that you grew more 
distant to the situation or more in tune to the

43:03.152 --> 43:15.308
actions of the day, the people, the effect of the 
Americans on Vietnam culture? Did this become

43:15.760 --> 43:17.122
more distant? No, it became more acute to me about 
the people. That's why I learned.

43:25.652 --> 43:30.638
That's when I started growing up, when I started 
realizing that this guy was not a coward. He just

43:30.779 --> 43:34.303
had a different idea of what life is. Knowing your 
customs, which we never did, I blame myself for

43:36.245 --> 43:39.389
that. But then again, everybody had a problem not 
understanding their customs, which meant we

43:39.449 --> 43:45.717
weren't right. We weren't wrong, but we weren't 
always right. And that's hard to say, because

43:48.387 --> 43:50.745
you're both.
