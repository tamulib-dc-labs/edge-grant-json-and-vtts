00:01.938 --> 00:05.924
young freshman or as an undergraduate?

00:05.944 --> 00:10.050
Well, it was pretty awesome to sit there in the midst of those people.

00:10.170 --> 00:15.558
And, you know, I didn't know a lot of the names that they called.

00:15.598 --> 00:20.425
Of course, there were student names that we had been familiar with at Silver Taps earlier in the year.

00:21.146 --> 00:29.498
But just hearing a few names that rang a bell that meant something that I had...

00:29.849 --> 00:33.153
a contact with made it meaningful.

00:33.213 --> 00:43.204
But the simple idea that these people whose names were being called, they were right in the same place where I was at one time.

00:43.945 --> 00:46.588
I'm going through the exact same thing they went through.

00:47.529 --> 00:51.574
It just brought it all home that this is why we're here.

00:51.634 --> 00:55.418
This is what we're all about is we care about each other.

00:56.039 --> 01:05.473
And I didn't really comprehend the full muster tradition as to what it is with all the meetings around the world and all that.

01:05.493 --> 01:12.604
You don't really get into that much until you get out of school unless you happen to be in an Aggie family that goes to them to start with.

01:13.585 --> 01:20.275
And it really, I think it helped me grow up a lot.

01:21.318 --> 01:26.105
Commencement for you, what was it like?

01:26.165 --> 01:29.049
Family came?

01:29.870 --> 01:44.170
Oh, yeah, and my brother and my dad had to practically carry my grandmother up to the top of G. Raleigh White because, of course, they didn't get there real early and most of the seats were already taken, but she wasn't going to miss it.

01:45.432 --> 01:47.596
It was real meaningful to me.

01:47.637 --> 01:54.170
I lost my mother while I was finishing school and also my grandfather on her side.

01:54.210 --> 02:06.175
And I can remember sitting there and thoughts going through my mind about how much she wanted to see that day and how much it meant to her.

02:06.712 --> 02:10.338
how without her prodding and pushing and all, I probably never would have been there.

02:11.339 --> 02:14.284
But, you know, it was kind of an awesome feeling.

02:14.304 --> 02:20.233
Of course, here I was, not knowing what was going to be going on after that.

02:20.333 --> 02:25.361
The Vietnam War was going on, and I knew that, well, I called my draft board.

02:25.381 --> 02:26.322
I said, what's going to happen?

02:26.342 --> 02:30.789
They said, well, next week we're going to reclassify you, and the month after that we're going to send you a notice.

02:30.809 --> 02:33.293
And so I started shopping.

02:33.728 --> 02:44.181
signed up with a recruiter for what they call the college op program and went in for basic and advanced training and then immediately into OCS.

02:45.062 --> 02:52.431
And it was kind of a real eye-opening experience.

02:53.813 --> 03:00.141
I tried to get jobs that summer to at least tide me over and the only job I ever got was working

03:00.678 --> 03:06.147
for my cousin's husband at the opening of the Schlitz Brewery in Longview, Texas.

03:06.267 --> 03:10.754
I never tapped as many kegs in a few days as I did then.

03:10.794 --> 03:13.939
And nobody else would touch me.

03:14.159 --> 03:17.284
I mean, they all wanted to know, you know, what's your status with the military?

03:17.384 --> 03:23.614
And I couldn't even get anybody to agree to take me on on a limited basis.

03:24.185 --> 03:24.966
at that time.

03:25.066 --> 03:43.195
I thought I was going to be a public relations type person at that time and they gave me the old deal about, you know, come back when you've got your military finished and you've had four years experience and all of this kind of stuff and I'm sitting here saying, how am I going to get experience if nobody will hire me?

03:45.739 --> 03:49.825
Commencement, was your name called and your hand shaking?

03:49.845 --> 03:50.206
Oh, yes.

03:51.187 --> 03:52.369
How important is that?

03:53.210 --> 03:55.033
I think it's very important.

03:55.133 --> 04:06.130
I think students who write off commencement and don't want to, you know, walk across the stage, I think they're missing something that means something to them.

04:06.190 --> 04:16.025
I mean, it's not something I can't remember every little action that happened and everything that went on that day, but just the idea that I was able to cross that stage.

04:16.806 --> 04:20.972
Of course, when I opened up my case and pulled my diploma out,

04:21.188 --> 04:23.311
and found out they'd misspelled my name on it.

04:23.451 --> 04:25.854
It didn't help a whole lot, but they got that fixed.

04:26.636 --> 04:28.939
But it was a good feeling.

04:29.680 --> 04:38.933
Of course, most people will tell you that they probably felt better the day they put their Aggie ring on than they did the day they got their degree.

04:38.953 --> 04:39.053
Yeah.

04:39.073 --> 04:40.735
Now, what did your ring cost?

04:40.795 --> 04:42.157
Do you remember?

04:42.177 --> 04:44.020
I believe it was about $36.50.

04:44.100 --> 04:47.144
And how did you feel when you put it on?

04:47.785 --> 04:48.466
Oh, it felt good.

04:49.067 --> 04:50.689
It made me think about my brother

04:51.125 --> 05:18.972
writing me when he put his ring on he said his hand felt so big he could hardly write this letter and uh... it it was a good feeling i mean that's you said i hate to admit it and it sounds a little childish to some people but getting that ring was what i felt like it was really all about i mean finishing up the next year or so and getting my degree just just didn't carry the same kind of weight uh...

05:19.930 --> 05:22.916
Do you have any ring stories?

05:23.898 --> 05:30.230
Many people, they've had an unusual situation where it was lost or they were somewhere and somebody spotted it.

05:30.531 --> 05:37.585
The most exciting thing about my ring is that I have to wear it on my left hand because the day I got it resized to fit better on my right hand,

05:38.172 --> 05:40.475
Some guy walked his dog right up to my dog.

05:40.576 --> 05:46.665
My dog took a leap, and my finger sprung, and I've never been able to get it on that hand since then.

05:46.685 --> 05:48.307
That's not very exciting.

05:48.447 --> 05:55.237
But nobody on the other side of the world spotted an Aggie ring in Singapore or something or other.

05:56.259 --> 05:57.962
I mean, we've always looked for them.

05:58.002 --> 06:01.226
I don't remember any outstanding occasions of that.

06:01.246 --> 06:07.015
That's what they're trying to collect those stories here about, and people keep sending them lost ring stories.

06:07.332 --> 06:10.796
But they really want to know about rings that help them make a connection.

06:10.976 --> 06:15.440
And I can't point to any particular event like that.

06:16.261 --> 06:17.442
You mentioned Aggie spirit.

06:18.163 --> 06:22.888
What is it or what are it that creates Aggie spirit?

06:24.209 --> 06:29.455
Well, you can kind of put it in a category of how they define love to me one time.

06:29.495 --> 06:35.601
They said, love is a feeling you feel that you're going to feel when you feel a feeling that you've never felt before.

06:36.357 --> 06:50.417
The Aggie spirit, it's just a sense inside you that defines your place and your relationship to a group of other people.

06:50.437 --> 06:52.399
That's about as close as I can come to it.

06:52.460 --> 07:04.997
I mean, to me, Aggie spirit is just a whole kaleidoscope of images that go through my mind when somebody says, what's it like to be an Aggie?

07:05.635 --> 07:07.759
I think about working on the bonfire.

07:07.839 --> 07:11.184
I think about the day I picked up my ring and put it on.

07:11.244 --> 07:15.912
I think about the musters I've been to and the silver tap ceremonies.

07:15.992 --> 07:21.321
I think about the times when I've been in trouble and somebody helped me out.

07:21.561 --> 07:26.850
I think about the times when somebody else had a problem and I had a chance to help them out.

07:27.320 --> 07:30.684
That sort of thing is not limited to one Aggie to another Aggie.

07:30.704 --> 07:35.250
And fortunately, a lot of Aggies practice that with other people they run into everywhere.

07:35.891 --> 07:38.013
And I think that's the beauty of it.

07:38.033 --> 07:42.639
I think you learn this feeling about caring for each other as Aggies.

07:43.460 --> 07:51.490
And I think a lot of people then take that and do something with it that affects how other people think about Aggies.

07:52.110 --> 07:55.875
Because I've seen letters from folks who

07:56.125 --> 08:00.873
had car trouble on the side of the road and they were elderly and knew they were going to have a problem with this.

08:00.953 --> 08:06.121
And lo and behold, this guy pulled over and stops and he said, I saw your Aggie sticker on the back of the car.

08:06.181 --> 08:07.283
I'm an Aggie, can I help?

08:08.585 --> 08:14.134
And I think about Jack Williams going to Tennessee and having car trouble.

08:14.485 --> 08:27.541
He reached up in the back window of his car and picked up this directory that Buck Wires gave him and he starts calling people and the next thing you know he's surrounded by cars and people wanting to help him and wanting to feed him and wanting to just put them up whatever they needed to.

08:31.266 --> 08:32.247
It's hard to talk about.

08:34.069 --> 08:40.277
Do you think Aggie spirit among today's students is strong also?

08:41.058 --> 08:42.720
I think it is.

08:43.544 --> 08:51.717
You know, we talked when I was in school about the two percenters, and I think we've always going to have those like with any other group.

08:51.917 --> 09:02.715
And I think, unfortunately, with a larger student body, that two percent ends up maybe becoming a lot larger group of people than we'd like to think about.

09:02.755 --> 09:06.721
But it's possible to go through A&M and not be touched by any of it.

09:07.202 --> 09:08.404
And some people do.

09:09.194 --> 09:21.013
With some of them, it might be because they're so involved in their academic program that they just don't want anything else to get in the way of that, and they won't let anything interfere with it, and that's good.

09:21.995 --> 09:26.162
But I think they and other people who do that miss out.

09:26.422 --> 09:31.891
For whatever reason they do that, they lose something that they could pick up here and take with them.

09:32.372 --> 09:35.978
And the majority, yes, I think still have it.

09:36.835 --> 09:38.156
I get excited.

09:38.236 --> 09:40.098
I've got a niece and nephew in school now.

09:40.239 --> 09:41.720
One's a junior and one's a freshman.

09:41.780 --> 09:47.686
And I get around those kids and their friends, and it's just in the air.

09:48.027 --> 09:53.332
It's just a vibration almost, a feeling that, hey, these people care about each other.

09:54.574 --> 09:54.834
All right.

09:54.954 --> 10:00.480
You made a point a while ago that I certainly share, that it's a series of shared experiences.

10:03.380 --> 10:11.704
maybe midnight yelp practice, maybe fish camp, football games maybe.

10:12.025 --> 10:15.735
Every one of those has some effect on it.

10:16.492 --> 10:21.297
Being an Aggie is, you remember the good things and the bad things.

10:21.397 --> 10:25.841
I mean, you remember that test that you should have made a better grade on.

10:25.861 --> 10:30.686
You remember that one that you did make a good grade on.

10:30.746 --> 10:34.690
You remember stopping to pet reveille when you walked to class.

10:35.051 --> 10:44.280
You remember somebody making that extra effort to be there to just give you a little encouragement.

10:44.320 --> 10:46.262
Maybe they weren't there for any other purpose.

10:46.613 --> 10:49.696
but they were there to let you know they cared about what happened to you.

10:50.557 --> 10:57.144
And every one of those little experiences dills, and that's the Aggie spirit.

10:57.164 --> 10:58.985
All right, I don't have many questions left.

10:59.906 --> 11:02.109
We've chewed up a lot of time.

11:02.429 --> 11:05.452
What did it mean to your life that you went to Texas A&M?

11:06.273 --> 11:07.594
It meant everything to my life.

11:07.834 --> 11:16.603
I probably would not have guessed that I would have ended up coming back here and spending as much time as I have.

11:17.107 --> 11:25.618
I look at the predecessors in my job, most of them were here maybe two, maybe three years.

11:25.718 --> 11:35.892
I've been here going on 29 years right now, and I just fell into something that I liked, and I was lucky.

11:36.091 --> 11:40.476
I kind of laugh when I think about how I got the job.

11:40.576 --> 12:02.622
I mean, and I'm pretty honest in telling people this, that Buck Wires went through a list of journalism graduates and people who were working in the field of journalism, and all of those either had decent paying jobs or jobs that they just liked enough that they didn't want to leave them, and he was left with me.

12:03.293 --> 12:10.006
I didn't make as much money working on a newspaper as some of those other people, so I was very much interested in moving for a monetary reason.

12:10.086 --> 12:15.877
But I found out after I got here that there were a lot of other reasons I needed to be back up here.

12:16.178 --> 12:23.872
And now I understand, looking back on it, why I get those phone calls from people who say, hey, are there any jobs in my field up there?

12:23.892 --> 12:25.335
I want to come back to Aggieland.

12:26.632 --> 12:28.775
Next to last question.

12:29.697 --> 12:35.785
Let's make believe that somebody walks up to you and hands you a million-dollar check with one requirement.

12:36.707 --> 12:43.136
You must pass it to Texas A&M, but you can decide what it would be used for.

12:44.799 --> 12:49.045
If you could make a big gift to A&M, what would you want them to do with your gift?

12:51.758 --> 12:55.308
Well, I'm assuming it could be split up into more than one use.

12:55.328 --> 13:06.460
Anything you want to... Of course, I think, you know, various types of scholarships is one use of it.

13:08.161 --> 13:19.219
We're making a lot of headway right now in academic circles, in gaining chairs and professorships and all.

13:19.359 --> 13:23.326
You know, might even want to add one or two of those to it.

13:24.308 --> 13:27.553
But the thing I would want to put money into, I think,

13:28.580 --> 13:39.370
would be into some of the support operations of A&M that are so meaningful to the school overall and to the students.

13:40.451 --> 13:47.958
I think in terms of things like the University Relations Office that does amazing jobs on a shoestring.

13:48.779 --> 13:52.382
I think about the archives, Dave Chapman, I'd want to put money into that.

13:53.864 --> 13:57.287
Definitely they need a lot of help over there because

13:57.858 --> 14:03.024
The thing about it is they don't need help just to do what they're doing now.

14:03.585 --> 14:07.089
They need help so they can do all of those other things they can't find time to do.

14:08.171 --> 14:11.615
And that's what I would want to do with it.

14:11.635 --> 14:16.461
And, of course, there are probably some student life programs and things that are very deserving of support.

14:17.162 --> 14:21.147
But we're doing an amazing job, I think, of collecting money for those kind of programs.

14:22.068 --> 14:27.274
But I think some of the basic offices that handle things for A&M,

14:27.440 --> 14:31.264
Student health services probably would be a good place to give some support to.

14:35.429 --> 14:46.882
Perhaps more facilities if you could add either equipment or other things to the student center that would allow more people to participate and do things.

14:48.144 --> 14:52.789
We pour a lot of money into brick and mortar and that's important.

14:53.562 --> 15:10.037
both the university president's office and our office has been talking in different aspects at some time about some sort of open-air pavilion, both for use of students and maybe for use of former student gatherings on special weekends and things.

15:10.798 --> 15:18.404
And they've done all the stuff with the student area out by Easterwood Airport, and I think those things need to be improved on.

15:18.424 --> 15:21.207
But I'd like to help some of the people

15:22.013 --> 15:24.137
whose main job is to help everybody.

15:26.982 --> 15:44.292
When I first came here, Photo Services operated on a deal where they got, I think it was like one percent or maybe one-tenth of one percent of every department's budget that allowed them to purchase supplies and to budget for covering different events photographically.

15:44.862 --> 15:54.453
And they've put them on a strict business footing over there to the point where I think we're missing a lot of things that ought to be cataloged and ought to be photographed.

15:54.473 --> 15:57.376
And I would like to see some help in that area.

15:57.396 --> 16:03.023
But those areas that I'm most familiar with them and university relations are ones I definitely want to help.

16:03.603 --> 16:06.527
All right, I've got one more question that I know of.

16:06.627 --> 16:10.431
Have we left anything out that you had on your high agenda?

16:11.879 --> 16:14.281
I don't think of anything.

16:14.842 --> 16:15.062
All right.

16:15.102 --> 16:22.089
Then my last question is, what feelings do you have for Texas A&M in your heart today, now?

16:26.493 --> 16:40.587
Well, one of my biggest concerns for A&M right now is the fact that we've grown so large and by trying to increase academic stature, we've become

16:41.056 --> 16:48.984
a great deal more selective other than the state's mandate that the top 10 percent of the high school classes can get admitted.

16:51.267 --> 16:58.174
I'm afraid we're overlooking a lot of the kind of students and people that have made A&M what it is.

16:59.175 --> 17:09.426
And you look back through our history, some of the people that have had the most impact and been most important to this place are people who probably

17:10.030 --> 17:15.195
barely scraped by in the grades, but they had the perseverance to do it.

17:15.715 --> 17:23.643
So they weren't selected for their academic achievements and necessarily for their leadership positions they had before they got to A&M.

17:23.663 --> 17:28.087
They were given a chance, and they made a lot out of that chance.

17:28.188 --> 17:32.692
I think there's a lot of people out there that I hate to see us sending them off to other schools.

17:33.853 --> 17:39.058
And while I think academic credentials and stature are important,

17:40.388 --> 18:08.522
I just don't want to see us overlook this critical area and that's that do we want people moving into leadership positions in this state and nation because they either had privilege or they were just happened to be outstanding students in high school where some people find it very easy to make grades or are we going to lose those people that

18:09.380 --> 18:23.161
because they didn't have much and because they had to work extra hard to get what they got while they were here decided that was important and made something out of themselves and decided that was important to help other people do the same thing.

18:24.403 --> 18:35.479
I wonder how many of these people that are graduating in the last five, ten years around here are going to still be here helping us do more things down the road.

18:36.361 --> 18:38.644
I'm afraid we're going to lose a lot of them because

18:39.248 --> 18:47.402
They didn't have the involvement when they were here, and they didn't have the struggle.
