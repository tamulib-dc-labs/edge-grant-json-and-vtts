00:01.263 --> 00:02.384
California, mama. Le dije, pues, ven pronto. Vas y 
recoges el trofeo y vienes pronto por mí. Le dije, y

00:07.750 --> 00:09.091
yo me voy. Pues, entonces, se vino luego, luego, él 
en el trofeo. Era un trofeo grande, nuevo.

00:17.319 --> 00:22.725
Entonces, se viene él pronto. Y llegó a Blumenthal 
con su esposa, porque ya estaba casada. So my

00:31.199 --> 00:39.988
brother was there with his wife and all his 
piscators. I got there and he said, Mom, I came for

00:41.610 --> 00:44.332
you. So I came. Then my brother paid me what I had 
piscated, and then I came. When I came,

00:53.722 --> 00:58.827
I picked up como de 200 a 300 pesos la temporada que 
yo, aparte de ropa, aparte de comida y de todo,

00:58.958 --> 01:11.051
porque ganábamos muy buen dinero.

01:11.692 --> 01:16.797
Todavía quedó mucho trabajo cuando yo me vine, 
pero yo me tenía que venir porque mi muchacho había

01:11.692 --> 01:16.797
ido por mí. Nomás llegamos aquí con mi mamá a 
arreglar todo y a visitar Mi hermano y mi mamá.

01:28.943 --> 01:31.409
Entonces dijo, mi mamá te vas a ir. Le dije sí. Me 
fui, como siempre, con toda mi familia. Hasta

01:39.207 --> 01:40.510
California. Este muchacho no sabía que yo iba por 
él. But your husband doesn't go to California? No,

01:46.982 --> 01:49.184
he always stayed in these places. In these places? 
Yes, he never went to California. He never went

01:52.608 --> 01:54.690
anywhere. He always stayed here. What kind of work 
did he have? Oh, in labor. He always worked at the

01:59.936 --> 02:01.578
ranch. Yes. He always liked to work at the ranch 
because, well, I don't know, I think he had a lot of

02:02.919 --> 02:11.348
education in Spanish. How much? Cuántos años de 
educación? Pues yo no sé, porque él estudió no aquí

02:17.078 --> 02:20.748
en México. En México. Él estuvo en México. Para 
muchos años. No, not much. I think it was the first

02:27.781 --> 02:29.244
one. The primary school in Mexico. The primary 
school. Six years. That's what I know. And then, he

02:36.155 --> 02:41.544
learned so well to speak. It seems that he had 
studied English. He studied it, he read it, like

02:47.313 --> 02:58.226
Spanish, and like speaking Spanish, he spoke 
English and everything. Well, I didn't correct

02:58.246 --> 03:03.332
him because I didn't know how to speak it. But the 
people who heard him speak said, it seems that your

03:03.492 --> 03:09.239
sir studied English. But no, he took it from the 
people, but he had a very good head. He had a very

03:15.275 --> 03:19.341
good head to learn it, you see? And he spoke it 
like... Well, no, but I say in the language. He had

03:26.631 --> 03:32.459
an accent to speak it, whether it was Spanish or 
English. You see? Like this boy who is in Noste. I

03:37.045 --> 03:39.909
tell you that he studied a little. That boy... He 
writes very well in Spanish and English, and he

03:42.275 --> 03:52.273
speaks it, and everything. And he studied very 
little. Well, I don't know your time. I don't know

03:57.522 --> 04:02.270
your time. How much time can you spend here? Here? 
It's 11, 11 and a half. There's a lot of time left.

04:16.861 --> 04:28.937
Well then,

04:16.861 --> 04:28.937
there in California there were many, many fields. 
No, thank you. There weren't many, there were many

04:31.676 --> 04:48.714
fields in those years that

04:31.676 --> 04:48.714
I was there in 55. There were many places, many 
fields of many people from Mexico and everywhere.

04:59.225 --> 04:59.966
Right? No. No? Yeah. Entonces, nosotros, ese 
muchacho estaba en ese campo. Somebody went out to

05:07.573 --> 05:10.656
the clubs, folks club. Estaba en ese campo cuando 
nosotros llegamos y aproximadamente sería como

05:11.437 --> 05:27.713
las cinco de la mañana cuando llegamos a ese lugar 
donde estaba ese hijo que está ahorita en

05:11.437 --> 05:27.713
California.

05:30.477 --> 05:37.183
Then my boy, Pita,

05:30.477 --> 05:37.183
arrives. And then he goes to Apea. He knew all his 
places. He goes to Apea to look for him. He stops at

05:43.789 --> 05:48.153
the door. You?

05:54.078 --> 05:54.739
No, I'm kidding. And then... You? You here? Yes. 
His mother.

06:05.931 --> 06:10.318
He got

06:05.931 --> 06:10.318
scared. I said,

06:10.959 --> 06:15.306
son, get ready. I'll be back soon for you. He said, 
well, I'm leaving soon. He got everything ready.

06:26.468 --> 06:27.689
He went. He got on the truck and passed me by, very 
happy. And he went with us to the place where we were

06:34.196 --> 06:37.339
going. In that place is Farport, California. 
That's where my boys were raised, all of them.

06:54.617 --> 06:55.598
I worked there. very hard, me and my children.

07:02.647 --> 07:24.555
We got there because a year before, a year ago it 
was, we got to that place, we met a contractor from

07:02.647 --> 07:24.555
that place who There was a very large field, as if it 
were

07:26.864 --> 07:36.381
a town. And that gentleman, very kind, he and his 
wife, and I think he had three children, because

07:36.401 --> 07:50.526
the other family was already separated.

07:53.830 --> 08:00.498
Well, we got there, they gave us a little house 
because all the apartments were small. And we

08:01.600 --> 08:03.322
were... I don't know...

08:08.208 --> 08:14.476
Seven,

08:08.208 --> 08:14.476
approximately. We had to be in that little

08:14.556 --> 08:21.725
room. So... Pure water, anywhere. There were 
roads, yes, but it was water. Then it was

08:31.036 --> 08:38.105
winter time. The boy, his son, had to go with my son, 
who was the one we went to pick up from that place,

08:40.128 --> 08:53.065
with the one who was in Washington, because he 
lived there. So he said, well, you're going to have

08:53.315 --> 08:58.641
to go and leave Washington. And I had to find 
someone to go with him. So I went and told his

09:03.966 --> 09:07.891
father, he's going to go. He gives permission to 
his son to go with my son to Washington to go and

09:08.732 --> 09:14.498
leave his sister. Yes, he says, of course, go. They 
go. Después de que llegamos de Texas, otro día se

09:21.175 --> 09:27.762
fueron para el estado de Washington. Ellos cuatro 
llegaron a Washington, dejaron a mi hijo,

09:29.023 --> 09:37.032
regresaron para atrás los dos. Bien, de salud. 
Allí nos establecimos. Entonces ya tenía mi hijo,

09:44.580 --> 09:50.406
que era el responsable de aquel troque, y de mí. in 
that place.

09:55.949 --> 10:01.157
So...

10:03.941 --> 10:05.543
I never... I was able to solve all the problems I had 
in my life. And I thank God that I didn't go to

10:10.350 --> 10:17.301
school, but school was my mind and my head. Yes. 
That was my school. A school of experiences. Yes,

10:22.124 --> 10:44.659
even though I was very young, I got married at 16 
years old, but God gave me that thought to direct,

10:22.124 --> 10:44.659
give advice to my husband and give advice to my nine 
children. and direct my person to me.

10:52.267 --> 11:06.284
Well, at that time,

10:52.267 --> 11:06.284
when I returned to California, I was not hopeful 
about my husband. I was not hopeful about my

11:07.005 --> 11:11.510
son. I was only hopeful about my person.

11:16.668 --> 11:23.098
Yo estaba esperando el porvenir de la vida mía.

11:25.622 --> 11:37.680
Yo llevaba

11:25.622 --> 11:37.680
como a 300 pesos,

11:25.622 --> 11:37.680
como a 300 a 400 pesos.

11:41.606 --> 11:45.392
Yo tenía para salvar lo que atrás podía sobrevenir 
en mí.

11:53.603 --> 12:01.396
Entonces,

11:53.603 --> 12:01.396
mi muchacho, este que está en California, ya no era 
aquel. Ya era otro hombre. ¿Por qué? Porque ya no

12:07.928 --> 12:10.452
había estado al lado mío. See? Because they 
respected me. Because what I said, that's what I

12:18.605 --> 12:23.594
did. Because that's how I imposed

12:23.614 --> 12:30.366
them. So, yes, he... Todos mis hijos se casaron, 
fueron al army, vinieron, han tomado ya de

12:35.575 --> 12:53.112
hombres, ya de que ellos salieron del lado mío, 
pero a mí no me han molestado. A mí no han sido mis

12:53.132 --> 13:01.380
hijos desobedientes conmigo que diga, mis hijos 
me han dicho esto, mis hijos me han dado lo otro a mí.

13:04.634 --> 13:07.638
My children have seen me all the time.

13:10.401 --> 13:18.330
And I don't have to say that my children have 
treated me badly, no. No, no. Everything they can

13:19.792 --> 13:22.556
do to me, they do. Everything I can say, they do. 
They have never bothered me. It doesn't make them

13:29.244 --> 13:32.127
arrogant, it doesn't bother me. And I tell them, if 
you are going to drink, and you come to drink here to

13:32.444 --> 13:39.692
my house, don't come. If you come healthy and well, 
come. But don't drink. That is the time of the

13:44.157 --> 13:45.778
married. But when they are at home and they come to 
drink every now and then, they don't tell me

13:46.419 --> 13:54.227
anything. Like this one who came from the service. 
He was upset and everything, but you're going to

13:58.111 --> 14:07.085
sleep and you're going to do this now. There's 
nothing here. See? Everyone's like that. So I

14:14.057 --> 14:18.504
don't have anything to say about them. It's just 
that they've all been good. And they were nine

14:21.609 --> 14:22.971
brothers. But those who were fighting, or those 
who were cursing each other, they were nothing.

14:30.575 --> 14:38.106
They, the first was the girl, who is the oldest. 
They all played with their four little brothers or

14:38.126 --> 14:42.373
their five little brothers. You are there, we 
don't want you here, that you are with us. You are

14:48.302 --> 14:49.804
there. And she was sitting there, just looking at 
those who were playing. But she didn't mess with

14:54.406 --> 14:58.473
them, because they didn't admit it. And she didn't 
have any more girls to play with. She played with

15:03.502 --> 15:04.724
what she had. She bought her a doll, she played with 
that doll. She played with little things, but what

15:09.813 --> 15:14.862
was she doing? No, nothing like that. They were 
very good boys because that's how they got used to

15:18.267 --> 15:24.015
it. The little brothers didn't have to fight. The 
little brothers didn't have to say this or that.

15:31.986 --> 15:33.628
Are all your daughters married? My daughters? 
Only this one is left. That's all. She is not

15:38.517 --> 15:42.103
married. She is not married, she is still here in 
the house. How old is she? I think she is 24 years

15:47.190 --> 15:49.895
old. And thank God that God has left her until now to 
think well.

16:00.070 --> 16:04.457
Well then, what did we do? No, we had a truck of the 
year. I think I had only one year of use of the truck.

16:17.795 --> 16:29.048
Well, I could

16:17.795 --> 16:29.048
have saved my truck.

16:31.731 --> 16:34.174
But sometimes that companies

16:34.897 --> 16:55.806
see people who are

16:34.897 --> 16:55.806
humble and they take over the position to do that. 
You see?

17:00.344 --> 17:04.408
Is your husband still alive? No. He died. In what 
year? In 1965.

17:14.017 --> 17:18.422
I was already here. I was here for about a month. 
So... I told him, they sent a letter. And he said,

17:34.216 --> 17:38.444
you know what? We're going to go for this truck. I 
told him. I told my boy. Yo había mandado porque el

17:45.265 --> 17:51.755
truco era de Washington y yo sé los reglamentos que 
hay. Pero como yo nunca, yo puedo sacar un carro de

17:52.216 --> 17:56.984
este estado y lo puedo llevar para otro estado. 
Pero yo aviso y yo mando mi dinero. ¿Ves? Así no me

18:03.695 --> 18:06.539
molesta, no le hace que esto venga con un carro 
nuevo. Entonces, este... He said, well, the truck

18:11.624 --> 18:14.949
is not here. He said, the truck is outside the 
state. I said, they told me in the letter. And since

18:25.323 --> 18:30.510
that truck was not in my name, it was in the name of 
the older boy, So I had to talk to the older boy and I

18:31.705 --> 18:36.271
told my boy. I had already sent the payment that was 
behind that truck. But I didn't know how he had

18:43.600 --> 18:48.206
taken it. So they say, here they come. As soon as 
they sent me the letter, they sent whoever picked

18:50.849 --> 18:58.759
it up. So I said to the boy, look, you're not going to 
sign any papers. I said, why? They shouldn't pick

19:05.976 --> 19:09.324
up that truck. I said, why? We were short of money. 
We were short of 18 bucks. They shouldn't have

19:14.956 --> 19:19.163
picked up the money, I said. Why? I already sent the 
money. And how did they pick up the money? And now

19:23.811 --> 19:25.635
they want to pick up the money. So they shouldn't 
have picked up the money since they came to pick up

19:25.655 --> 19:29.061
the money. And you're not going to sign anything. 
And besides that, you shouldn't sign because it's

19:30.924 --> 19:34.991
the boy's. The boy is the one who has to talk to him 
and he has to sign it. What do you think they did?

19:42.260 --> 19:44.283
They said, no, let's just go to the agency. Let's 
go, he said, because they want him there. I said,

19:49.911 --> 19:52.936
well, he's not the owner of the truck. Well, they 
took him. On the way, they made my boy sign the

19:56.761 --> 20:02.429
papers, telling him not to sign them. They took him 
and put him in the agency. Oh, how did he think I was

20:07.176 --> 20:10.461
so mortified? Well, then I went to look for the boy. 
Well, no, he says, well, the truck. No, my boy came

20:19.895 --> 20:23.601
and said, Mom, the truck stayed at the agency. Why 
did you leave the truck at the agency? I didn't tell

20:27.187 --> 20:29.931
you that you didn't have to sign any papers. He 
said, well, they made me sign and they told me so

20:30.873 --> 20:35.801
much. He says, but I already told you. Why did you do 
it? That's why they took him where they were

20:39.926 --> 20:47.936
talking to me, so that he could sign on the way, to 
make him believe and he would sign. In these days,

20:47.956 --> 20:57.708
where do your children

20:47.956 --> 20:57.708
live? In these days, where do your children live? 
There you go, Janie.

21:07.664 --> 21:09.466
Yes, the food. Well, do your children now live all 
here or in Washington and California? I have my

21:17.517 --> 21:19.339
whole family irrigated. Look, come and see them. 
Close it and come and see them. I have them all here.

21:24.146 --> 21:25.568
Come and see them. Let's go. To see them, my boys, in 
portrait. Oh, in portrait. In portrait. Just a

21:28.792 --> 21:29.693
moment. But where do they live? Look. These now. 
Now they are all irrigated. They are all... Near

Philadelphia. In Philadelphia? She is married to

21:45.735 --> 21:48.358
a Canadian. Oh, really? Yes. She had a lot of 
education, my girl who is in Philadelphia. How old

21:58.753 --> 21:59.334

her school. Yes, that's good. And this other boy

26:06.486 --> 26:09.250
oldest. Yes, the oldest is in Austin. He, all his 
life, he liked to be a mechanic. Yes. Because when

26:17.803 --> 26:21.108
he went to the service, he wanted to study for that. 
Yes. But he didn't pass the tests of the

26:21.929 --> 26:27.217
applications for that. Yes. But he... through his 
head. He practiced and he practiced. He has a gas

26:35.228 --> 26:37.251
station in Austin. A gas station in his country? 
Yes. And he is a mechanic. And he manages

26:44.221 --> 26:50.770
that gas station. And his boy too. His boys too, but 
now one of them got married. Right now he only has

26:55.116 --> 26:57.840
one son and they all got married. Well, he had two 
daughters and two sons. Yes. And the other son who

27:05.791 --> 27:08.455
lives in Austin is? Right now, the youngest boy is 
Roel, German, who is the youngest. He lives in

27:15.805 --> 27:17.527
Austin. Yes. But he, I'm not very practical to say 
where he works, but He

27:24.820 --> 27:41.655
married, no one knew that he could marry a girl from 
a family that I have known for many years. All my

27:41.715 --> 27:47.941
family, the first one was raised with that Basque 
family, right? Now that we came from California,

27:52.529 --> 28:03.901
He met with that girl and with that Vázquez family, 
who was from Robestán, and that's where that

27:52.529 --> 28:03.901
family grew up, but he went to Austin. So this boy, 
as he was going all the time, because they

28:03.921 --> 28:17.695
recognize him as his father, who is the oldest boy, 
he always wanted to be there when we came, looking

28:03.921 --> 28:17.695
at his brother and helping him in the garage. Ah, 
yes. Yes, he always likes to come to work and there.

28:22.769 --> 28:24.852
That is five and six. Where does the boy or girl six

28:25.633 --> 28:33.404
live? Well, it's this one. This one that I'm 
telling you about. This one that I'm telling you

28:39.793 --> 28:46.583
about, he got married and he thought about it very 
well because he has He got married, he got married

28:47.069 --> 28:52.674
to a very good girl, and she has a very good job. She 
works in the office of the telephone and

28:52.694 --> 28:58.780
insurance. She fixed all of that. He got married, 
he did his application, and then he left because he

29:00.541 --> 29:11.891
worked here in the pants factory. The pants 
factory. Since he left school, my boy worked

29:12.852 --> 29:14.514
there. What was his name? Roel Alemán is the one I'm 
talking about. Roel Alemán. And he lives here. No,

29:21.653 --> 29:23.596
he lives in Austin. In Austin. In Austin. He's the 
youngest of the greats. Yes, yes, yes. All right,

29:32.027 --> 29:33.309
yes. So, he worked here, got married, and left 
work, and applied, and then he left. So, he came in

29:37.815 --> 29:39.978
with his father-in-law to do all this work. Yes. Of 
carpentry and everything. He... He told his wife,

29:44.714 --> 29:50.743
let's both work together because those workshops 
are very big. He did the application and he has a

29:51.765 --> 29:57.794
very good memory. So he took, they gave him to 
study, he passed all the exams of that class of

29:59.957 --> 30:10.333
work. Y ahorita tiene el muy buen trabajo y le 
dieron una máquina para que él estudiara mucho

30:11.680 --> 30:20.476
eso. Ese trabajo que está haciendo él es de puro 
botón. Puro botón. Bueno. And now he works at

30:27.205 --> 30:30.668
night. And he learned all of that very soon. All of 
that. They taught him there very soon. And there

30:37.094 --> 30:40.017
they gave him his job. And now both of them are doing 
very well. Both of them. And both of them are

30:45.582 --> 30:47.303
working there in that place. Yes. And he, well, 
there are boys who didn't go to school because of

30:48.244 --> 30:54.289
that. And they don't have the job that he has now. 
And he very soon. Yes. And there he is. And he's

31:01.308 --> 31:03.631
making very good money, both of them. And right 
now, his car has already been paid. He's just going

31:08.918 --> 31:11.361
to complete his two years of marriage. He bought a 
little car of those pretty ones. A little station.

31:17.109 --> 31:17.870
Yes. Now he has his... Now he says he already 
ordered his new pickup. And he has his house,

31:26.487 --> 31:37.400
small, new, his place, all surrounded, all very 
well arranged, and he is the smallest. Yes. All of

31:37.981 --> 31:43.527
them have thought, well, well. Yes. Yes. And this, 
and now this, this girl is just, ah, well, my boy,

31:44.849 --> 31:52.798
like right now, And those are the five boys. Rudy, 
well, he lives here. He got married. He has his

31:58.646 --> 32:01.049
property here. Then he bought all that property 
and built his house. In this town? In this town.

32:05.877 --> 32:07.379
You're talking about the ones outside? Yes. Well, 
that's all the ones I have outside of here. Yes. All

32:14.510 --> 32:16.513
these. Right now, the only ones I have here is this 
girl. This one. Yes. In the state of Texas. In the

32:23.920 --> 32:32.131
state of Texas, there is Rudy,

Yes. And, Rabiel, Roel, they are here. And Janie.

Janie, the youngest. Yes, she is here in the house. 
Y el muchacho, mi muchacho el que murió, porque

32:49.968 --> 33:00.545
murió uno en un accidente en California.

33:00.565 --> 33:09.419
Él dejó sus tres hijos, que fue el que se le sigue el 
segundo del mayor. Y él murió en un accidente. Allá

33:13.686 --> 33:17.612
fue en California, porque él When I left, he got 
married, and he stayed here. He stayed here. As

33:24.456 --> 33:26.138
soon as he got married, I left. When I was three 
years old, I came back. Then I made myself a little

33:32.326 --> 33:37.172
house. Because then I worked very hard for three 
years.

33:42.358 --> 33:48.426
And I was one of those who pecked the plums, pecked 
the nuts.

33:50.735 --> 33:57.841
Piscaba, bueno, todo lo que, las corridas que 
había de las, de las frutas. Sí. En California, no

33:58.262 --> 34:03.266
todos los años, nomás ciertos años los trabajé. 
Nomás una corrida así hasta el día que me vine pa'

34:04.487 --> 34:08.151
Texas. Entonces él, el cincuenta

34:10.313 --> 34:20.522
y cinco mismo se fue él a verme. with his family. He 
already had two children, and he went to see me. So,

34:31.152 --> 34:35.738
I was going to be there for the next three years. So 
he said, I'm going there. He said, are you going? He

34:39.823 --> 34:42.947
said, yes. So we came. He made this little tree that 
I have there, to bring us everything. Y yo, ya se me

34:51.232 --> 35:01.022
habían casado el hijo que me acompañaba, ese que 
está en California.

35:01.042 --> 35:08.470
Entonces, este nos fue a traer, pa' vernos y pa' 
traernos. Él se trajo el carro de nosotros con la

35:08.490 --> 35:12.614
trela. Y mi nuera se trajo su carro de ellos con mi 
muchachito este, Rudy. And his children, he came

35:22.349 --> 35:29.239
with his children

35:22.349 --> 35:29.239
and he died. And then I sent him money to make me that 
little room because I didn't have anywhere to be.

35:37.131 --> 35:38.052
And he did it. It was a little room like

35:38.072 --> 35:42.699
this. I came. And I had surgery here, from my sight, 
from both eyes, I had surgery. And it cost me 100

35:48.918 --> 35:55.689
pesos the healing of each eye. I relieved myself. 
In 1956, my boys were here at school. They had never

35:59.755 --> 36:07.446
been here in Texas at school, but that year they 
were here because I had surgery from the sight. So

36:07.466 --> 36:11.172
they left school, and they just left and we left. 
back to California. So, my son left his wife and

36:15.481 --> 36:18.524
children. And he took them back to California, 
because at that time, I was the only one who had the

36:18.544 --> 36:30.476
eldest daughter. But she also laughed, but he 
always wanted to leave some, but with his wife's

36:30.496 --> 36:40.527
will. So, He was working there with me for a while. 
He was doing very well. He worked. He wanted to

36:58.939 --> 37:02.583
continue his studies. He followed the school. The 
first year he went, he worked with us, with his

37:04.666 --> 37:11.415
wife, because he wanted to go to school. And the 
first year that he went to see us went very well, and

37:16.703 --> 37:23.453
that was when we came with him. The second year that 
he left us, that was in 1956, he was working too. And

37:29.201 --> 37:40.238
he continued his school to compose televisions.

37:42.209 --> 37:46.395
And he put up a fruit shop there on the 9th.

37:49.500 --> 38:03.361
He went, they, he was very Catholic in the 
mornings, he went very early, it was Sunday, and

37:49.500 --> 38:03.361
they went to Mass, he with his children and his 
wife, because they were both very Catholic. Very

38:04.602 --> 38:07.727
early they went to Mass, and after Mass, they would 
go to the shop they had, to sell, because he wanted

38:07.943 --> 38:17.156
to continue. And he was granted. So, when he left 
me, he came to work with his family and they came

38:23.023 --> 38:31.635
back. He continued his school and finished it. And 
he told me that he was leaving. So I waited for him.

38:40.681 --> 38:45.972
When he came back, I waited for him. So I was going to 
come back that year. So I told my son, my son, I'm

38:50.321 --> 38:56.614
writing to your grandmother. What do you say? What 
do I tell you? Are you going to go back with us or not?

39:01.922 --> 39:08.833
He says, Mom, I already told my grandma that I'm not 
going to go back. I'm going to go until next year. He

39:11.036 --> 39:13.240
says, what I want, you know what, Mom? You're going 
to go there. I want you to come there. And you go

39:18.903 --> 39:23.490
there and bring my grandmother. And I don't want to 
go there anymore. And he says, you know very well

39:26.395 --> 39:31.724
that it's always very hard there. And well, it's 
hard for one to be there. Here the jobs are paid

39:38.835 --> 39:40.217
better. Well, then I told my mother. It's a bad luck 
that my son was about a month old, I think.

39:47.482 --> 39:53.070
Approximately a month old when this happened. He 
made applications, because as he was already

39:54.692 --> 40:06.148
known in that mill in Britain, he made 
applications

39:54.692 --> 40:06.148
to work. He had already fixed his place to put 
television work, because there was none in that

40:12.785 --> 40:16.671
place.

40:19.695 --> 40:28.128
She says, Mom, I've fixed the place where I'm going 
to live and where I'm going to put to work. She says,

40:29.910 --> 40:35.198
and then I'm going to put Ruri too, to help me sell.

40:37.490 --> 40:45.820
I said to him, what I don't want is for you to apply as 
soon as you arrived at the BRIT. He said, mom, we

40:47.562 --> 40:53.430
came to work and maybe it will take a long time to 
talk to me. I said to him, it's better that you rest

40:53.450 --> 41:00.358
and then apply. He says, no, he says, well, after 
all, when they call me, while I'm working, he says,

41:01.098 --> 41:21.224
there on the TV, he says, look, I already grabbed 
three people, I already grabbed what I'm going to

41:01.098 --> 41:21.224
buy and everything, I already

41:01.098 --> 41:21.224
sold them. Well, son, I told him, but I didn't want 
to. Well, nothing, if they hadn't talked to him

41:25.930 --> 41:30.396
late, they talked to him soon. He said, Mom, they 
already told me. I said, what do you mean? Well, I

41:39.135 --> 41:39.936
don't know. He went to work when they told him. He 
was going to a party, I don't know what party, when

41:43.865 --> 41:50.359
the mayordomos were going. Muy a la carrera, 
porque cada que les dan off, se ponen bien

41:51.335 --> 41:57.766
contentos y todo. Porque cuando mi hijo me 
escribía las cartas de aquí de Texas, todo el

41:58.648 --> 42:06.682
tiempo decía, mamá, voy a tener off tal día, dice. 
Voy a descansar. Ese día, así les dijeron. Yo

42:15.128 --> 42:22.962
andaba trabajando y siempre, siempre, yo todo el 
tiempo los he encomendado a Dios. ¿Dónde

42:22.982 --> 42:28.473
ese día se me pasa a mí? Tanto que se me pasa decir por 
Él. Y me voy yo al trabajo. I walked about a mile or

42:39.952 --> 42:49.865
two away

42:39.952 --> 42:49.865
from the town. Then they say that at lunchtime they 
were eating, and everyone was eating and talking,

42:50.646 --> 43:02.020
because they were going to be off. And then they 
ate, and another friend of his He said, are you

43:10.377 --> 43:12.019
leaving? Yes, he said, I'm leaving. He said, 
because I'm looking at you. He said, no, don't go.

43:21.949 --> 43:26.233
He said, I don't know what they were giving him more 
than food. He said, no, he said, I don't want it

43:26.253 --> 43:29.416
anymore. And you know that my boy, all the time, 
since he started school, he lived all the time in

43:29.436 --> 43:37.785
his pocket. Everything he needed, he brought it 
there. All his papers, everything he needed, he

43:41.670 --> 43:48.861
brought

43:41.670 --> 43:48.861
it there. Then he left. The other boy stayed there. 
But after a while, he also said that he was leaving.

44:02.116 --> 44:08.947
There were exits outside the mill and there was a 
lot of loose sand. The roads had to go to Hacina.

44:12.172 --> 44:15.877
This road from the mill went to Hacina. And from the 
end, the trucks had to go to Hacina. The trucks of

44:20.945 --> 44:26.774
the mayordomos came very slow to Hacina. And this 
went to Hacina. A lot of land entered the road.

44:31.512 --> 44:39.605
Where my boy was going to come from, he came from 
Sina, with a lot of land. With a lot of land, this

44:39.625 --> 44:44.874
friend of his came. He hit him. He hit him. Look at 
the door. It jumped. He was stuck. A wire got in

44:53.909 --> 44:56.651
here. What was left in his heart? The shock wire got 
in here. He was stuck. They had to put something in

45:04.238 --> 45:12.086
to get

45:04.238 --> 45:12.086
him out. So... This is a lack of precaution. Yes. 
This truck, they say he had already said, because

45:16.000 --> 45:22.957
that was the victim, he was a friend, and he himself 
killed him. Yes. Because they had already said

45:25.804 --> 45:29.633
that this truck did not have enough manpower.
