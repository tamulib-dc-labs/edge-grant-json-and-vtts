00:02.933 --> 00:04.504
This is August 22.

00:05.310 --> 00:06.981
We're testing, testing, testing.

00:07.847 --> 00:09.096
Hello, I'm testing.

00:11.371 --> 00:12.372
This is August 22nd.

00:12.533 --> 00:23.828
I have the pleasure and honor of chatting with longtime colleague and close friend Dr. Victor Hugo Treat Sr.

00:25.791 --> 00:32.661
about his recollections and memories of almost four decades in Bryan College Station.

00:33.281 --> 00:40.872
To begin with, Vic, describe for this tape and a stranger who might listen to it or read the transcript years from now,

00:41.341 --> 00:49.675
Describe your background growing up, parents, and your experience before you got to College Station.

00:49.695 --> 00:54.062
I was born in Matagorda, Texas, in a town called Old Gulf, which no longer existed.

00:54.082 --> 01:07.163
It was a sulfur town, and my father was an engineer down there, and my grandfather also worked for the sulfur company there, Texas Freeport Sulfur, I think it was, and moved to Houston part of the time,

01:08.122 --> 01:09.804
most of my life I spent in Houston.

01:10.806 --> 01:16.935
I grew up, my father died when I was six and I was raised reared by my mother.

01:16.955 --> 01:25.928
It was depression times and times were tough and hard but we got along fairly well because my mother was one of four sisters and a brother.

01:26.414 --> 01:34.349
And we all kind of pooled together and lived together and, as I said, did not suffer many of the hardships that some people suffered.

01:34.369 --> 01:41.723
We didn't have all of the thrills and many of the things that we have today, but we always have plenty of food and plenty of clothes.

01:41.703 --> 01:45.451
My family was pretty active in church.

01:45.491 --> 01:52.566
We belonged to Christ Church downtown Houston and my family was in the choir and were active in the church the whole time.

01:53.387 --> 01:58.598
I attended Henderson Elementary School, which is still there I might add.

01:58.578 --> 02:03.884
And then Johnston, Albert City Johnston Junior High School and then San Jacinto High School.

02:05.846 --> 02:07.588
I grew up in an unusual neighborhood.

02:08.850 --> 02:17.099
Most of my young teenage life and uptime I got married was in a Jewish neighborhood, so it was kind of unusual in that sense.

02:17.119 --> 02:21.324
Many of my early friends were Jews and most of my life were Orthodox.

02:21.844 --> 02:24.147
There was none of those Reformed things around those days.

02:25.223 --> 02:33.397
And I attended San Jack, graduated, attended University of Houston, where I ran track, and was on a track scholarship, and did fairly well there.

02:35.540 --> 02:48.502
Got married when I graduated from college in 1953, and then in 19, worked at various jobs which convinced me that I wanted to continue my education, working with Coca-Cola in a steel mill.

02:49.323 --> 02:51.687
In 1955, my first child was born.

02:52.038 --> 03:13.142
William J. Treat, and then my wife got married in 1953 to Joanne Harvolt, and we then moved to Austin where I attended graduate school at the University of Texas at Austin, and 1963 then came to Texas A&M and joined the history faculty.

03:13.603 --> 03:15.945
How did you and A&M get together?

03:16.947 --> 03:18.248
What happened for you to

03:18.785 --> 03:23.318
first of all know there was a vacancy and how did you get that to fill that vacancy?

03:24.060 --> 03:25.424
I had no intention of getting a job.

03:25.464 --> 03:32.724
My wife had a very good job in Austin and we lived in University Housing for almost nothing and we were content to stay there for several more years.

03:32.804 --> 03:33.807
I was one of the older

03:34.225 --> 03:47.218
guys and so the various I was always given some of the cushier jobs and I was I taught at night at one of the local high schools and which paid better money and we really lived quite well.

03:47.839 --> 04:02.494
I received a phone call one Saturday morning from a Dr. Cotner, William Cotner who was a real good friend close friend of Joseph Milton Nance at A&M who Nance was the head of the history and government department and so Cotner said he thought I'd come down and talk to

04:03.082 --> 04:05.706
to Dr. Nance, and I was somewhat reluctant.

04:05.726 --> 04:07.128
I said, okay, so I went down.

04:07.729 --> 04:20.167
I really wasn't seeking a job and certainly didn't try to sell myself, and we chatted and talked, and all of a sudden, out of a clear blue sky, I had the job, and September 1963 came to A&M.

04:20.227 --> 04:22.551
My wife Joanne stayed in Austin.

04:23.011 --> 04:32.245
We lived in University Housing, had not finished a PhD yet, so we decided to stay there, and I came over here and lived here for half a year, almost three quarters of a year by myself then.

04:32.917 --> 04:37.704
Do you remember any formal interview with Dr. Nance?

04:37.724 --> 04:39.386
Yes, it was a formal interview I met in history.

04:39.406 --> 04:40.107
Describe it.

04:41.268 --> 04:44.974
Well, I walked in and sat down, and Dr. Nance was already there.

04:45.014 --> 04:50.561
He did not get up, and I went in and sat down and introduced myself, and he began to ask me some questions.

04:51.883 --> 05:02.097
He asked me some questions about history and what I thought about certain things, and he asked me about my background, my background,

05:02.077 --> 05:09.585
church and religion and where I went to high school and and what I've done and some of the various jobs I've held and then that was it.

05:10.306 --> 05:17.895
Did you get the impression that there might have been some answer you could have given that would have turned your chances away?

05:17.915 --> 05:24.422
No not really I think he already having talked to Kotner I think already he had made his mind unless I really

05:24.807 --> 05:28.271
pull some kind of boo-boo if I didn't want it, that the job was probably mine.

05:29.513 --> 05:39.125
Back in those days, before all the fair play came in, most jobs were filled by friendship, I know you, you know me, and so on and so on.

05:39.746 --> 05:42.109
Do you think he had asked Kotner questions about you?

05:42.390 --> 05:43.811
Oh, I think so, yes.

05:43.831 --> 05:48.197
That's why Kotner called me, and I was in good terms with Dr. Kotner.

05:49.399 --> 05:52.823
The University of Texas back in that day was somewhat compartmentalized,

05:53.107 --> 06:01.325
And in a sense, I don't want to make this sound, that was a really terrible thing, but in some sense, Dr. Kotner was not one of the inside group.

06:02.387 --> 06:09.462
And as you well know, Dr. Nance was not always one of the inside group, and they've been good friends for a long, long time.

06:10.336 --> 06:20.509
And did Dr. Nance, when the interview here was over, did he tell you yes or no, or did he tell you he'd be in contact with you?

06:20.529 --> 06:22.852
Tell me I had a job, and he would send me papers.

06:22.872 --> 06:25.956
He already knew when I walked out that he'd offer me the job.

06:26.837 --> 06:31.143
And we won't talk about money anymore, but what was the beginning salary he offered you?

06:31.223 --> 06:31.564
$6,000.

06:31.584 --> 06:32.204
$6,000.

06:32.465 --> 06:33.866
For nine months.

06:33.967 --> 06:34.748
For nine months.

06:35.649 --> 06:38.132
Did he describe what your task would be?

06:38.618 --> 06:41.161
Yes, he said I would be teaching basic American history.

06:41.502 --> 06:45.347
There were very few advanced courses, and I might teach government.

06:45.587 --> 07:00.608
Back in those days, it was history and government, and many of the people, especially the younger ones who came in, filled in, and my minor was political science, so that didn't, it was government, called Texas, government here at A&M, as I recollect, and so that would have been fine with me because I certainly could have done that.

07:01.128 --> 07:03.211
Did you accept on the spot, or do you remember?

07:03.371 --> 07:04.192
No, I did not.

07:04.713 --> 07:05.955
I said it sounded very good.

07:05.995 --> 07:08.338
I needed to talk to my wife, and also I needed to talk to my

07:09.550 --> 07:30.660
advisor who at that time was Barnes F. Lathrop and so I called Lathrop and he made a number of remarks and things and he finally told me that well A&M was a major school and he thought that there were some drawbacks but A&M he thought had promise and so I probably ought to take it.

07:31.181 --> 07:33.164
What drawbacks do you think he foresaw?

07:33.384 --> 07:34.866
Well it was still an all-male school.

07:35.977 --> 07:39.462
And he thought that a lot of people here, he used the term marionettes.

07:40.424 --> 07:49.517
And he thought that the military was pretty strong and that A&M was very, had many traditions that were not always good, he thought.

07:49.998 --> 07:55.346
And I think he had probably the typical view of many people at the University of Texas at that time.

07:55.947 --> 07:59.673
During that conversation with Dr. Nance, and this lasted about how long?

08:00.935 --> 08:03.739
Oh gosh, 30 minutes, 45 minutes, not a long time.

08:03.837 --> 08:10.345
Do you think that as you walked out, did you feel he had really endeavored to learn about you?

08:10.486 --> 08:10.866
I think so.

08:10.886 --> 08:18.416
He asked me a lot of questions about my background, education, childhood, beliefs, family, things like that, yes.

08:18.476 --> 08:20.879
Did he ask you about anything that you thought was inappropriate?

08:21.440 --> 08:22.301
No, I don't think so, no.

08:22.962 --> 08:33.135
Of course, in hindsight, some of the things that he might have asked me in 1963 might very well consider inappropriate today, but back in 1963, it was still not inappropriate.

08:34.162 --> 08:46.781
Because I'm assuming that he would have, it would have been more positive that you were a church attender to him, whereas today it might not be.

08:46.801 --> 08:47.903
I think so, yes.

08:48.364 --> 08:50.988
You had to be a better person if you attended church.

08:51.008 --> 08:51.388
All right.

08:51.408 --> 08:55.475
So then you moved over, that's in April?

08:56.576 --> 08:57.638
No, that's in August.

08:57.837 --> 08:58.878
In August?

08:58.898 --> 08:59.839
Yeah, it was getting close.

09:00.320 --> 09:03.243
Do you have any idea why he waited so long?

09:03.363 --> 09:05.205
Had somebody... Have no idea.

09:05.265 --> 09:08.088
Have no idea why they were doing it.

09:08.308 --> 09:11.191
Whether they got some more money or decided to need somebody else or what then.

09:11.851 --> 09:22.022
They had hired, the year before, they had hired another Texas Ray Stevens had gone from, gone over there and so.

09:22.323 --> 09:26.387
Now, was this, were we still having Saturday classes?

09:26.467 --> 09:28.429
Was this in the fall semester?

09:28.449 --> 09:29.790
Yes, still Saturday classes, uh-huh.

09:29.810 --> 09:32.272
Okay, so the fall semester began in mid-September.

09:32.513 --> 09:33.513
Yeah.

09:33.533 --> 09:34.975
And you moved over here.

09:35.035 --> 09:37.197
What kind of housing did you find?

09:37.217 --> 09:48.588
I rented a room in, by, from Mrs. Lancaster, Mrs. Lancaster over on the south side of campus, off Throckmorton, actually, what's that street now?

09:48.608 --> 09:49.008
Dexter.

09:49.268 --> 09:51.250
Dexter, yeah, off Dexter.

09:51.517 --> 09:56.744
She had a big old house, and she rented rooms out, and I rented a room from her.

09:57.365 --> 09:58.827
Remember what the rent was?

09:58.847 --> 09:59.508
No, I don't.

09:59.768 --> 10:01.450
It wasn't much, though, that's for sure.

10:02.312 --> 10:08.120
And it wasn't heated, and I lived there up to December, I guess, through January, January.

10:08.480 --> 10:12.766
And Joanne is still... Working in Austin.

10:12.846 --> 10:13.347
In Austin.

10:14.708 --> 10:19.515
And let's see, and Jay...

10:19.495 --> 10:24.808
Is not yet... No, he was born in 55, you see, so he... Okay, so he stays in Austin.

10:24.828 --> 10:26.632
He stays in Austin with his mother, yes, in school.

10:27.053 --> 10:28.717
What did you teach that first semester?

10:28.757 --> 10:29.278
Do you remember?

10:29.298 --> 10:31.143
105, all 105.

10:31.223 --> 10:31.804
I was lucky.

10:31.865 --> 10:36.255
I was really expecting to have to teach some government, and so I'd gotten a...

10:36.792 --> 10:47.724
government textbook and had reviewed national government and Texas government, because I fully expected to have to do it, because I'd been warned by some people, oh, you'll have to teach some government.

10:48.325 --> 10:49.246
And so I thought, okay.

10:49.847 --> 10:52.149
But I did not, I never taught any government.

10:52.450 --> 10:53.131
How many sections?

10:53.531 --> 10:53.791
Four.

10:53.971 --> 10:54.232
Four.

10:54.812 --> 10:57.395
They had just cut back from five, as I remember him.

10:58.016 --> 11:05.905
And describe the physical location of the department in Nagel Hall.

11:06.104 --> 11:07.307
We were on a second floor.

11:07.327 --> 11:16.709
At that time, our offices were on opposite end and I was given a desk in a large office.

11:17.010 --> 11:19.776
The office was occupied mainly by

11:21.528 --> 11:22.269
Oh, good grief.

11:22.289 --> 11:27.899
Garland Bayless and also then a guy named Anderson.

11:27.939 --> 11:31.105
I don't remember his first name now, but he was actually government what he really was.

11:31.506 --> 11:37.637
He officed in there and that was on the second floor and the dean's office was still in Neagle Building at that time, the dean's office.

11:38.138 --> 11:39.039
Hubert was the dean.

11:39.420 --> 11:44.008
In fact, when I went over to A&M to accept a job, I was personally interviewed by Hubert.

11:44.225 --> 11:49.571
Back in those days, the dean interviewed every individual person and asked them questions and things like that then.

11:49.591 --> 11:51.293
Do you remember the kinds of questions he asked?

11:51.313 --> 11:52.415
No, I don't remember anything about it.

11:52.775 --> 11:53.976
It was not a very long interview.

11:55.278 --> 12:01.305
Describe how it was to get acquainted with this, the members of this faculty.

12:01.505 --> 12:02.466
Well, it was very small.

12:03.027 --> 12:09.535
And, of course, our office was Garland Bayless, and anyone who was Bayless knows he's very friendly, so he made me feel very, very much at home.

12:10.276 --> 12:11.397
And Anderson was a nice,

12:12.001 --> 12:12.402
guy.

12:12.462 --> 12:21.275
As I recollect, he was a minister or a part-time minister, so he was very friendly, and it was a very small department, and it was pretty easy to get to know people.

12:22.057 --> 12:27.785
Did you get the impression there were any senior people who were more influential than any others?

12:28.226 --> 12:29.728
Yes, I got that pretty quickly.

12:30.610 --> 12:40.405
It seemed pretty clear that Nance was, thought a great deal of Lloyd Taylor's opinions, and

12:43.017 --> 12:54.154
I think that maybe not many more Nance respected Lloyd Taylor and I think that most of the other people not so.

12:54.635 --> 12:56.999
Was Dr. Nelson still active?

12:57.339 --> 12:57.660
Yes.

12:58.401 --> 13:08.316
Screaming Owl was still there and he certainly was not considered influential and I think that Nance walked his own route pretty much.

13:08.617 --> 13:13.545
And if he talked to anybody, it was largely, I think, Lloyd Taylor that he had opinions on.

13:14.045 --> 13:20.175
Did anybody, Dr. Nance or anyone else, give you any kind of departmental guidelines, rules?

13:20.195 --> 13:20.635
Oh, yes.

13:21.357 --> 13:24.882
I was expected to dress and act like a college professor.

13:25.583 --> 13:32.093
Now, that wasn't always spelled out, but I was expected to dress and act like a college professor, and I can remember very clearly

13:32.815 --> 13:37.940
My wife bought me a whole new outfit, short Bermuda shorts, a nice shirt, new tennis shoes.

13:38.400 --> 13:42.364
And one Saturday morning, I wore those out to school to do some work in the office.

13:43.305 --> 13:45.007
And this was in 1964 or 65.

13:45.868 --> 13:49.231
And Monday morning, it was a note in my box saying, see me.

13:50.032 --> 13:57.739
And I was called into Dr. Nance's office and told me that he had noticed me on Saturday and that I was dressed inappropriately, he thought.

13:58.740 --> 14:01.843
And since I don't believe in tilting windmills, I did not do it again.

14:02.262 --> 14:12.877
Nowadays, we might do that deliberately and call someone's bluff, but I know people in our department who did that, if you remember Mr. Monroe, they weren't around very long.

14:13.839 --> 14:18.225
Heads had power in those days.

14:18.666 --> 14:19.807
What other rules?

14:20.709 --> 14:22.912
Were there either spoken or unspoken?

14:23.312 --> 14:24.995
Well, very clearly, you kept office hours.

14:25.596 --> 14:26.777
Your door was left open.

14:26.958 --> 14:31.324
It was an open door policy, and you were expected to be there pretty much from 8 to 5.

14:31.895 --> 14:33.978
with your door open unless you were in class.

14:35.059 --> 14:40.145
And you expect to be available for the students.

14:40.646 --> 14:43.029
Let's see, in that era, did people smoke in their office?

14:43.289 --> 14:43.970
Oh, sure, yeah.

14:44.310 --> 14:45.452
People smoked in their office.

14:45.472 --> 14:46.293
It was a common thing.

14:48.355 --> 14:52.080
Did any of the other faculty members give you any advice?

14:53.731 --> 14:55.392
Oh, it's kind of hard to remember that.

14:55.453 --> 14:57.454
It's been, gosh, almost 40 years now.

14:58.275 --> 14:59.236
I'm sure Bayless did.

14:59.296 --> 15:01.778
Bayless, well, I know Bayless did because we chatted a good bit.

15:02.218 --> 15:04.300
And, of course, they had me over for dinner and things like that.

15:05.101 --> 15:06.442
And I cannot remember now.

15:07.703 --> 15:10.085
I went over to Monroe's for dinner as well.

15:10.105 --> 15:16.671
And I'm sure in those conversations, those two I can remember pretty clearly that undoubtedly they did make some remarks to me.

15:18.273 --> 15:22.236
And were there some of the colleagues that struck you as interesting characters?

15:22.722 --> 15:23.323
Oh, Lord.

15:23.363 --> 15:24.944
Lloyd Taylor would be at the top of the list.

15:24.984 --> 15:27.827
Lloyd and I started out by being enemies in a way.

15:28.728 --> 15:30.110
We got cross lives at each other.

15:30.370 --> 15:30.770
How so?

15:31.471 --> 15:38.058
Well, one day a car was parked and I left my boy Jay in there with our little dog, Sparky.

15:38.679 --> 15:42.102
And Sparky got out of the car and Jay was trying to get him back in the car.

15:42.202 --> 15:47.127
And Jay was talking to him rough and poking at him, not going to hurt him.

15:47.147 --> 15:49.750
And Lloyd Taylor went by and told him to quit doing that.

15:49.770 --> 15:52.493
And if he didn't quit doing it, he'd come over and whip him.

15:52.912 --> 16:02.384
And I came out of the office about that time, and someone telling my nine-year-old boy that he was going to whip him did not sit well with me, and so I very promptly told him exactly what I thought of him.

16:02.945 --> 16:12.878
And Lloyd was very cool to me for several years, and one of those strange things, Lloyd was a very good friend of Alan Ashcraft, and Alan Ashcraft and I became good friends.

16:13.347 --> 16:22.499
And once I became good friends with Alan Ashcraft and then Lloyd decided I wasn't too bad a guy and I was, went on my way to try to be nice to Lloyd and we became fast friends.

16:22.519 --> 16:25.703
I have some pictures of Lloyds now that he gave me before he died.

16:26.424 --> 16:27.465
What about other characters?

16:28.386 --> 16:30.849
Well, Screaming Al, of course, it was one.

16:31.991 --> 16:33.312
Names elude me right now.

16:33.452 --> 16:36.036
Why did, why was he called Screaming Al?

16:36.056 --> 16:36.957
Because he screamed.

16:37.638 --> 16:38.899
He screamed in class.

16:38.979 --> 16:39.580
About what?

16:40.201 --> 16:41.042
Politics.

16:42.406 --> 16:49.618
Al hated Franklin Roosevelt and students used to bait him.

16:49.658 --> 16:50.379
They did it deliberately.

16:50.419 --> 17:08.008
He could be teaching a course in 105, a long way from Franklin D. Roosevelt and students would bring up something about Franklin Roosevelt and that ended the class pretty quickly and Al was off running about and he hated Franklin Roosevelt and he hated John F. Kennedy.

17:09.440 --> 17:14.647
Uh, let's see, other senior people in years of service would have been Dr. Bass.

17:14.667 --> 17:15.949
He'd retired before I got here.

17:15.969 --> 17:16.830
Oh, okay.

17:16.850 --> 17:18.813
He was already retired when I came to 63.

17:19.394 --> 17:20.616
So Claude Hall?

17:20.676 --> 17:22.238
Claude Hall, Duncan.

17:23.279 --> 17:23.640
Ah.

17:23.660 --> 17:26.023
I did not get to know Claude Hall until a little bit later.

17:27.525 --> 17:36.578
Claude officed in, down near the, near the head's office, and so he was kind of off limits, and I did not get to be a good friend with Claude until somewhat later.

17:36.912 --> 17:42.102
We weren't, you know, we weren't enemies but we were never close until a good many years later then.

17:42.542 --> 17:44.105
Duncan I got to know fairly well.

17:44.125 --> 17:44.747
Describe him.

17:45.869 --> 17:58.532
Duncan was already an older man and was one of those that had not finished his PhD and he taught Texas history and right at that time there were three or four people teaching Texas history.

17:58.883 --> 18:02.086
Nance, Lloyd Miller, Duncan.

18:02.187 --> 18:03.468
Tom Miller.

18:03.488 --> 18:04.669
I mean Tom Miller.

18:05.971 --> 18:14.119
And actually Ray Stevens was brought in that he might teach Texas history so, and I could teach Texas history to that matter.

18:14.139 --> 18:17.463
There were four or five people in the department and there weren't that many classes in those days.

18:17.723 --> 18:19.044
And you mentioned Alan Ashcraft.

18:19.064 --> 18:19.285
Yes.

18:19.785 --> 18:28.114
Alan Ashcraft was a Civil War historian, a very fine teacher, excellent with students and worked very hard at it.

18:28.499 --> 18:31.888
and was one of our better lecturers probably as far as from the student viewpoint.

18:32.530 --> 18:39.630
And he and I would get along with, I never understood why really, but he did not get along with Dr. Nance very well.

18:40.573 --> 18:42.458
And no one ever seems to know why that was the case.

18:43.687 --> 18:44.749
Let's see.

18:45.851 --> 18:47.775
It was Charlie Wines.

18:48.236 --> 18:49.318
Charlie Wines had already gone.

18:49.458 --> 18:50.220
He'd already gone.

18:51.422 --> 18:54.027
I'm trying to think of others.

18:54.047 --> 19:00.379
Did you or anybody else think that Dr. Nance had any pets?

19:00.359 --> 19:02.643
Anybody that he gave special?

19:02.683 --> 19:03.544
No, not really.

19:04.045 --> 19:08.752
It seemed pretty clear that he and Lloyd Taylor were close together because he went down his office lots of times.

19:09.033 --> 19:14.321
In fact, Taylor's the only one I know, and that's not quite true, Claude Hall.

19:15.142 --> 19:19.790
If I had to pick a second person that he talked to, and of course, Herb Lang.

19:20.491 --> 19:21.372
Now, I became...

19:22.010 --> 19:24.153
These people I became friends with a little bit later.

19:24.654 --> 19:27.097
I knew Monroe and Bayless earlier.

19:27.477 --> 19:32.264
As time went on, I became very good friends with Herb Lang and also Lloyd.

19:34.927 --> 19:48.405
If I had to pick the two people or three people that Nance talked to the most, and I don't think necessarily their pets, it would of course be Lloyd Taylor, Herb Lang, and Claude Hall.

19:48.385 --> 19:50.108
And they were senior people.

19:50.529 --> 19:53.354
Describe Herb Lang.

19:53.375 --> 19:57.623
Well, for a Yankee, he was more Southern acting than anyone else probably.

19:57.963 --> 19:59.566
He almost came on as a Southern gentleman.

20:00.428 --> 20:01.951
He worked very hard for his students.

20:03.213 --> 20:04.255
He was a very good teacher.

20:04.295 --> 20:08.824
I think the least you could say about him is that he's a gentleman.

20:09.260 --> 20:12.524
He was a gentleman in the old school, and so would Claude Hallby.

20:12.564 --> 20:14.006
They were both gentlemen of the old school.

20:14.427 --> 20:18.833
Describe a typical, in those years, a typical departmental meeting.

20:20.435 --> 20:21.857
Well, we met together.

20:22.537 --> 20:28.625
In the early days, of course, government would have been with us, and there were very few questions from the floor.

20:28.645 --> 20:34.373
Dr. Nance talked and described what was going on, and then the meeting was over pretty much.

20:35.770 --> 20:52.682
That year or two when political science, as they wanted to be called then, were splitting away, they frequently raised some questions and made accusations about how they weren't being treated fair and that Dr. Nance was trying to block them from separating, which was not true.

20:53.000 --> 20:56.405
most of us understood that Dr. Nance would like to get rid of them, you know, and put them all over there.

20:56.445 --> 21:00.430
There were more troublemakers in that area than there were in the history department.

21:00.851 --> 21:07.140
Do you remember going to any kind of social event at the Nance's home in your early months?

21:07.160 --> 21:07.760
Yes.

21:07.780 --> 21:08.441
Nance frequently.

21:08.501 --> 21:11.986
We went over there for dinner one time by ourselves.

21:12.026 --> 21:15.972
It was a private thing, and we ate.

21:16.833 --> 21:19.817
And then I guess the first year or two we were here,

21:20.270 --> 21:24.055
He also had general social function where the whole department was invited.

21:24.516 --> 21:25.598
But those didn't last.

21:25.978 --> 21:29.764
They then stopped somewhere in the middle, late 60s, I believe.

21:30.445 --> 21:32.948
Now, describe his work habits.

21:34.330 --> 21:38.817
Well, he was always there probably by 7, 7.30 in his office.

21:38.837 --> 21:40.139
And he stayed until 5.

21:40.259 --> 21:41.080
He was there.

21:41.482 --> 21:44.589
Unless he walked over for coffee, he was a coffee drinker.

21:45.090 --> 21:48.297
And so every morning he walked over for coffee and met some of his friends.

21:48.377 --> 21:50.521
I don't think he went to his department very often.

21:50.561 --> 21:52.706
I don't remember him really going to the department too often.

21:52.987 --> 21:54.149
He met other people over there.

21:54.991 --> 21:56.875
And then he stayed until 5 or 5.30.

21:57.395 --> 22:03.204
Am I correct in recalling that he didn't think we should have a coffee pot in Nagel's room?

22:03.224 --> 22:03.925
That's right, yeah.

22:04.446 --> 22:07.291
If you wanted, you could walk over to the MSC and do it over there then.

22:07.511 --> 22:12.679
That's what I always thought, that he didn't think it was a good thing for us to have it there, but it was all right.

22:13.160 --> 22:16.365
Well, you'd congregate there too much, I think, probably, that sort of thing.

22:16.801 --> 22:25.369
And did you have the impression that he was doing research, that he was also working scholarly?

22:25.389 --> 22:25.709
Oh, yes.

22:26.149 --> 22:27.691
If he wasn't in the office, he was in the library.

22:28.191 --> 22:30.913
And he always had something on his desk he was working on just about then.

22:32.475 --> 22:37.719
Who were the key secretaries in those years?

22:37.759 --> 22:38.280
Do you remember?

22:38.300 --> 22:39.000
I don't remember.

22:39.061 --> 22:39.621
I don't either.

22:40.782 --> 22:43.625
There was one lady, an older woman, who was there for a long time.

22:44.826 --> 22:46.487
And I just don't remember now.

22:48.526 --> 22:49.107
That's terrible.

22:49.127 --> 22:50.168
I should have remembered their names.

22:51.710 --> 22:55.796
And the office was at the west end of the second floor of Nagel.

22:55.816 --> 22:56.036
Right.

22:56.737 --> 23:02.685
And the dean's office was straight opposite the head of the stairway in the middle of the second floor.

23:04.147 --> 23:06.851
We had most of the offices on that second floor.

23:07.031 --> 23:07.572
Well, and the third.

23:07.592 --> 23:08.954
Some on the third, yeah.

23:08.974 --> 23:12.419
And then economics on the second, on the first.

23:12.439 --> 23:12.559
First.

23:12.927 --> 23:14.048
and in some geography.

23:14.409 --> 23:21.318
Geology was in that first basement and journalism.

23:21.819 --> 23:28.327
I'm not sure how long geology and geography stayed there, but Fred Smith was there.

23:29.328 --> 23:30.750
His nickname, of course, was Fat Freddy.

23:30.770 --> 23:35.256
I don't know what he said, but he had an office there for good many years when I first came.

23:36.164 --> 23:40.630
Did you meet in those early months some people in other departments or?

23:41.030 --> 23:51.183
Oh yes, I got to know some people in economics, got to know some people in journalism, and of course Fred Smith I got to know quite well who was in geography geology.

23:52.725 --> 23:57.290
Did you make some other friendships that lasted a long time early on?

23:57.310 --> 24:00.995
Yes, very early I had to know some people.

24:01.195 --> 24:05.901
Jack Grant, who was actually in the

24:07.450 --> 24:08.952
Well, in the oceanography area.

24:08.972 --> 24:10.013
How'd you get acquainted with him?

24:10.333 --> 24:24.730
Well, he ran the reproduction system of oceanography and meteorology, and I had to do some mats and things and diagrams for my dissertation, and he did them for me.

24:24.750 --> 24:30.017
He had all the fancy equipment, and he would do it cheaper than the university would do it.

24:30.437 --> 24:30.637
All right.

24:30.677 --> 24:34.622
Now, describe how you were able to mesh

24:35.665 --> 24:43.181
your new faculty duties, getting ready to have that full workload, and finishing up your dissertation.

24:43.201 --> 24:43.823
Not very well.

24:45.626 --> 24:48.713
Actually, I made great progress

24:49.418 --> 24:51.680
I often tell people this.

24:51.700 --> 24:52.681
We made a grave mistake.

24:52.781 --> 24:56.045
Joanne should have stayed in Austin for at least a year, year and a half.

24:56.065 --> 24:57.546
Maybe we had real cheap housing there.

24:57.846 --> 24:58.767
She had an excellent job.

24:58.787 --> 24:59.388
She enjoyed.

25:00.249 --> 25:01.850
We took her cut in pay to come over here.

25:02.511 --> 25:09.718
And I was working very hard on my dissertation that first six months until she came over in the spring of 64 then.

25:10.199 --> 25:13.983
If she had stayed over there in Austin, I would have probably finished my dissertation in a year, year and a half.

25:14.663 --> 25:16.405
If that she came over, we bought a house.

25:16.891 --> 25:21.576
We had a second child, and things slowed down then considerably then.

25:21.937 --> 25:23.599
So I didn't finish my degree for a few years.

25:24.019 --> 25:24.640
All right.

25:24.660 --> 25:29.665
So she came over at mid-academic year.

25:31.287 --> 25:32.268
That'd be early 64.

25:32.869 --> 25:33.069
Yes.

25:33.550 --> 25:34.651
And you all bought a house?

25:35.192 --> 25:37.735
Over on what was called Redmond Terrace in those days.

25:37.815 --> 25:39.737
It was off Jersey, off the golf course.

25:40.578 --> 25:45.143
And back in those days, houses would have taken, you could buy houses for just picking up the payments.

25:45.528 --> 25:54.181
And we bought a house from a former military man who had put a big down payment down, and we bought it quite cheaply, and it was a nice place.

25:54.201 --> 25:55.503
Do you remember what the price was?

25:56.164 --> 26:04.375
Well, the house had originally been $13.7, something like that, and we got, I think, for $12, and I think, or $11.5, and we put $500 down.

26:04.436 --> 26:05.237
He'd already reduced it.

26:05.417 --> 26:06.118
And it was about?

26:06.470 --> 26:07.391
What in size?

26:07.752 --> 26:09.294
One bathroom with three bedrooms.

26:09.915 --> 26:11.457
And about how many square feet?

26:11.477 --> 26:12.419
Oh, I think 2,000.

26:12.439 --> 26:15.002
It was a big house for us in those days.

26:15.022 --> 26:17.306
And that was a new residential?

26:17.326 --> 26:18.608
Well, it had been built a couple years earlier.

26:18.628 --> 26:20.290
No, but I mean that was a new developed area.

26:20.310 --> 26:21.191
New developed area, yes.

26:21.392 --> 26:23.014
Had Redmond Terrace Shopping?

26:23.074 --> 26:26.679
Redmond Terrace Shopping Center was there, and it was the Cat's Meow at that time.

26:26.700 --> 26:29.824
And what retail establishments were there?

26:29.844 --> 26:32.468
Well, there was a drugstore there, Redmond Terrace Drugstore.

26:32.808 --> 26:33.790
There was a barber shop.

26:34.090 --> 26:35.953
There was a Brookshire Brothers store.

26:37.385 --> 26:44.735
And there was a, oh, well, no, it wasn't academic.

26:45.176 --> 26:45.937
It was not academy.

26:45.957 --> 26:47.539
It was one of those before that then.

26:47.559 --> 26:48.280
Oh, boy, yes.

26:48.300 --> 26:49.802
I had the name of it just a while back, too.

26:49.842 --> 26:50.423
Yes, yes.

26:50.523 --> 26:51.104
But it was there.

26:51.424 --> 26:52.045
Yeah.

26:52.065 --> 26:54.429
And there were some smaller places there as well then.

26:54.449 --> 26:58.414
But Brookshire Brothers and that place took up much of the area then.

26:58.782 --> 27:04.653
Describe how you and Joanne became a part of the community, church and other things.

27:05.093 --> 27:06.736
Well, we started attending St.

27:06.776 --> 27:08.560
Thomas Episcopal Church because it was convenient.

27:09.261 --> 27:15.372
We went down to the church downtown, but it was a long way away, and so we started going to St.

27:15.392 --> 27:16.574
Thomas, which was quite convenient.

27:17.175 --> 27:22.545
It was also associated with the university, so we thought that was probably the best thing to do, and we became active there.

27:23.116 --> 27:26.964
And I eventually became active with the Acolytes there, and Joanne was active with the women.

27:27.906 --> 27:34.982
And I eventually was what Presbyterians call a senior warden, who was the chairman of the vestry at that time.

27:35.082 --> 27:36.325
I served two terms at that.

27:36.725 --> 27:38.730
I was on the vestry, I guess, for six years.

27:39.632 --> 27:41.175
And we became active there.

27:41.662 --> 27:43.344
I became active in a number of organizations.

27:43.824 --> 27:50.070
One of them was the Men's Garden Club, which I'm still active in, and so is Mr. Monroe, and it's been around for a long time now.

27:50.991 --> 27:53.653
And got to know people that way.

27:53.693 --> 27:58.098
I was interested in Indian artifacts and fossils, and so I met a number of people that way.

27:58.758 --> 28:04.724
In fact, I got to know Dean Hubert a little bit better because Hubert was involved in rocks and fossils and things.

28:04.744 --> 28:11.230
How did, how, do you remember how those first acquaintances came about with Hubert?

28:11.598 --> 28:15.882
Hubert always remembered names, not whether it was just me, but Hubert always knew my name.

28:15.922 --> 28:19.125
And I could walk across the campus, and he would say, how are you, Victor?

28:19.686 --> 28:22.229
Now, whether he could do that with every faculty member, I have no idea.

28:22.829 --> 28:31.678
But I got to know him that way then, and I met him, I went to football games, and I worked football games with a number of us from the history department, and I got to know him there.

28:32.118 --> 28:38.905
And Hubert attended football games those days, and I would see his wife there, Mary Julia, and we would chat a few minutes.

28:39.172 --> 28:41.682
And he was a very friendly person in those days.

28:42.947 --> 28:44.835
And then also he had a rock shop.

28:45.477 --> 28:49.975
And I went in the rock shop some and got to know him that way then.

28:50.056 --> 28:52.800
The Rock Shop was already going in those days?

28:52.960 --> 28:56.225
Well, not that early, but I mean, I'm talking down the line some.

28:56.245 --> 28:58.648
Rock Shop was in operation in the 70s, I guess, yeah.

28:59.209 --> 29:02.213
It was over 20, had 25 years, I guess, long in there.

29:02.233 --> 29:11.046
In those early days, did it matter that you had a UT Austin experience?

29:11.567 --> 29:14.932
No, because most people in the department were connected to you.

29:15.673 --> 29:19.438
Dr. Nance seemed to want to hire them, and so I suppose

29:19.908 --> 29:25.635
Uh, my, myself, Garland Bayless, Ray Stevens, uh, Herb Lang.

29:25.655 --> 29:28.699
There was one other one too, Duncan, uh, Tom Miller.

29:30.421 --> 29:33.205
Uh, over half the department's probably graduates from TU.

29:33.405 --> 29:36.629
So, and Nance himself, so, uh, no.

29:36.649 --> 29:41.275
And as political, as the history and government department was divided,

29:41.997 --> 29:44.522
and the new Department of Political Science was created.

29:44.602 --> 29:47.127
What did the people in the History Department think about that?

29:47.387 --> 29:47.908
We're glad.

29:47.968 --> 29:48.609
We were glad.

29:48.629 --> 29:50.172
It was rather acrimonious.

29:50.353 --> 29:57.967
I know the people in government had the idea, and I don't remember all their names now, but we were out to get them and things like that.

29:58.007 --> 30:02.976
They were trying to prevent them from separating, when in reality, everyone would like to see them go.

30:03.597 --> 30:11.265
And so I think that there was some bitterness, and I think history was glad to see them go.

30:12.006 --> 30:13.167
I was so new at that time.

30:13.267 --> 30:14.489
Did this happen, what, 66?

30:15.510 --> 30:15.870
Somewhere.

30:15.890 --> 30:16.731
Very early in there, yeah.

30:17.071 --> 30:20.715
And so I was relatively new and really didn't know it was going on a lot.

30:20.735 --> 30:27.442
So I knew there was some bitterness because I spoke to some of them, and they really felt that they were put upon, and they weren't.

30:28.243 --> 30:30.786
Describe as much as you can recall

30:31.323 --> 30:34.848
early experiences in teaching Aggies?

30:36.250 --> 30:40.837
Well, in those early days, I really liked the Corps because everyone had a name tag.

30:42.319 --> 30:47.726
When I came here, the Corps was no longer compulsory, but nearly all freshmen were Corps members.

30:47.746 --> 30:49.529
And so they all had that little name tag.

30:49.549 --> 30:58.782
And so other than sleeping in class, and that was not only them because I had people sleeping in class the year I

30:59.015 --> 31:23.765
I retired, so it was not that alone, but they would sleep in class frequently because of what they had to go through sometimes, but having name tags was nice, and they certainly were very respectful, and they certainly did not ask any questions out of line, and you didn't have near as much problem with controlling a class in those days, other than I said sleeping, and there was a lot of that going on.

31:24.165 --> 31:26.288
Now, you had taught some sections at UT.
