Another one is a policeman himself. He may be 
involved in some personal problems that would

00:09.722 --> 00:18.513
affect his performance on the job. He might have a 
toothache. He might have a bellyache.

00:26.703 --> 00:28.785
Wife might have pussed at him. He might not have got 
no sleep last night. Maybe he's got a girlfriend

00:32.750 --> 00:36.855
about two weeks late. he might have something of 
his mind. To give you an example,

00:42.535 --> 00:52.029
there was an old boy that I started with.

00:54.974 --> 01:00.342
And I made sergeant before he did. Later on, he was 
made sergeant and given me to train. We'd been

01:08.847 --> 01:12.053
friends from the time we met.

01:14.918 --> 01:26.798
He developed a little gallbladder problem and 
went to the hospital to have a minor operation.

01:28.762 --> 01:29.824
Doctor got in there. Turns out it was terminal 
cancer. He had less than 90 days to live. I went by

01:36.353 --> 01:41.700
the hospital every day to see him. Some days he was 
awake, some days he wasn't. Some days we talked,

01:47.809 --> 01:52.035
some days we didn't.

01:54.959 --> 01:55.580
Until he died.

01:58.464 --> 02:04.352
The day he died was about 8, 3 in the

01:58.464 --> 02:04.352
morning. Wack was there.

02:10.390 --> 02:11.872
Her mother and dad were there. He didn't have a 
mother and dad, he didn't know. And, uh, got things

02:17.498 --> 02:23.985
pretty well settled down. I got his wife in the car 
and took her home.

02:29.891 --> 02:34.937
Then I got a call from one of the men that he needed a 
supervisor.

02:38.701 --> 02:39.722
We get out there. or I get out there and what he 
needed a supervisor for was that he had two grown

02:40.445 --> 03:06.621
men in a neighborhood there with new houses that 
had just been recently finished

02:40.445 --> 03:06.621
and they were arguing or the argument was over the 
location of a fence line in the back of the two

02:40.445 --> 03:06.621
houses separated them out in between. One of them 
said it was here, the other one said it was there,

03:11.125 --> 03:15.151
which was six inches difference. The officer had 
explained to him that that was not a police

03:16.874 --> 03:35.123
problem, that was a civil problem, and

03:16.874 --> 03:35.123
that there wasn't anything he could do about it, 
and he'd talk to the other state people about it.

03:35.305 --> 03:40.776
Survey people, title people, whatever.

03:40.796 --> 03:49.995
And they were not satisfied with his decision

03:40.796 --> 03:49.995
and insisted that he call the supervisor. I 
listened to all this, and I had

03:50.015 --> 03:56.689
this other problem on my mind. I told them at the 
time that they had to explain what the problem was,

03:59.234 --> 04:07.466
and this officer explained to you what the answer 
to the problem is. Now, you goddamn son of a bitch,

04:07.486 --> 04:18.522
I've been in the hospital for the last 90 days with a 
friend that died this morning of cancer, and you

04:07.486 --> 04:18.522
called me over here to ask me the same thing? Yes, I 
went through with it, in language and in accents.

04:24.490 --> 04:27.975
Shit, I've been criticized for it in what form? As 
it was, there was no complaint made. There was no

04:31.925 --> 04:33.467
investigation made of it. A policeman can get 
involved, yeah. And he can blow up a caseload.

04:43.779 --> 04:48.245
He's supposed to, but they're imperfect. You just 
saw my last question. Do you think the police, I

04:50.368 --> 04:54.573
mean, that the public expects the police to be 
perfect or not? Sure. They've got the right to

04:56.315 --> 04:57.777
expect it.

05:00.997 --> 05:01.979
But they're not gonna get it. Never will. It can't 
be done.

05:08.749 --> 05:12.094
Just like you expect A&M to win every football 
game. But we can't do it. Or we expect the Dallas

05:14.598 --> 05:16.962
Cowboys to. Every spring season we expect 
Detective Rogers to be playing in the World

05:16.982 --> 05:20.447
Series. They ain't gonna make it. We expect 
perfection out of every policeman. You can't

05:26.897 --> 05:28.540
expect anything less.

05:33.228 --> 05:36.472
But realistically, you're never going to get it.

05:44.020 --> 06:02.661
Just like one of the, to give you a sense of what I 
mean, one of the schools that I went to, the subject

05:44.020 --> 06:02.661
was investigation of traffic accidents, how to 
determine what happened and who was at fault. and

06:03.232 --> 06:09.240
what could have been done to correct it that wasn't 
done or something like this. The school was put on

06:09.260 --> 06:21.897
by Northwestern University out of Illinois, out 
of Chicago, the top accident investigation

06:09.260 --> 06:21.897
school in the country.

06:23.079 --> 06:29.728
In their teaching, they teach theoretically the 
perfect way to investigate an accident. And one of

06:31.970 --> 06:40.818
them was telling me, one of the instructors there, 
he spent three weeks on one accident.

06:40.838 --> 06:43.681
We've got officers out here working 10 and 12 
accidents a day. We don't have that kind of time.

06:46.664 --> 06:52.789
But they've got to teach you the theoretically 
perfect way to do something. Then you adapt it to

06:52.809 --> 06:57.994
your own situation. But you've got the benefit of 
the training. to do it that way. You shortcut

07:04.461 --> 07:05.903
what's required. The same with your policeman. 
You expect perfection, but you're going to get

07:08.686 --> 07:14.354
shortcuts. Same

07:14.374 --> 07:22.244
question. 1968, Rich Nixon ran for president, a 
law and order platform, a big deal in the United

07:22.264 --> 07:30.495
States. law and order this and law and order that. 
After he was elected, millions and millions of

07:33.417 --> 07:38.282
dollars went to local law enforcement. His what? 
Millions and millions of dollars went out to local

07:38.883 --> 07:42.707
law enforcement. What was an effect here? Did 
y'all get new gear? Was there any noticeable

07:47.231 --> 07:53.138
effect of his campaign on increasing law and 
order? How did the money go out? It went directly to

07:55.600 --> 08:00.786
local departments. If it's $50 for you and $100 for 
you, I never heard of it. OK. Now, there were LEAAs

08:05.625 --> 08:15.355
and different groups of this type, or federal 
grants. Numerous of those, and they involved

08:17.196 --> 08:23.943
paperwork and justification and youth programs 
and this kind of stuff. But just to be handed some

08:23.963 --> 08:27.086
money, I never heard of that. It might have been. 
OK. um another political question during the time

08:30.162 --> 08:55.225
in the police force there were seven presidents 
with any uh that's not directly tied at local law

08:30.162 --> 08:55.225
enforcement is any any one president sitting out 
of his administration being the most favorable to

08:30.162 --> 08:55.225
law enforcement

08:30.162 --> 08:55.225
i don't believe really

08:58.732 --> 09:08.521
The president himself

08:58.732 --> 09:08.521
could affect law enforcement to an appreciable

08:58.732 --> 09:08.521
degree. You've got your legislative houses that 
pass the law, the courts that rule on them, the laws

09:08.761 --> 09:27.237
that have been in existence for years,

09:08.761 --> 09:27.237
the Supreme Court. which, with the effect of some 
of the decisions, creates new laws,

09:29.005 --> 09:48.936
there would be very little noticeable effect from 
the president or the local law enforcement, I

09:29.005 --> 09:48.936
believe. I don't know that one's been better or 
worse.

09:55.668 --> 10:01.354
I guess, lastly, is there anything you'd like to 
add to anything that's been said or anything I

09:55.668 --> 10:01.354
didn't mention you think?

10:04.758 --> 10:07.220
Is it important? No. The courts right now are one of 
the biggest

10:08.802 --> 10:22.637
problem areas, I believe, of the judicial system 
to complete.

10:25.300 --> 10:43.169
their

10:25.300 --> 10:43.169
way of handling cases, the way they're requiring 
cases to be handled,

10:25.300 --> 10:43.169
the decisions of the appeal courts, and some of the 
decisions of the Supreme Court. Hopefully,

10:43.189 --> 10:51.443
somewhere along the line, this will change to the 
rights of society as opposed to the rights of the

10:43.189 --> 10:51.443
accused.

11:00.147 --> 11:04.708
If you don't have anything else to add, I guess that 
wraps it up. Okay. I'll go get my coffee.
