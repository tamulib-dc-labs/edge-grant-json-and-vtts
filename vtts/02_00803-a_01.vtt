This is a test. This is an interview with Dr. 
Trevino, Doctor of Veterinary Medicine. Today's

00:11.966 --> 00:15.590
date is June 12th, 1980. This is Terry Anderson. 
This is a test.

00:28.285 --> 00:31.489
This is an interview with Dr. Gerberto Trevino, 
Department of Veterinary Pathology, Texas A&M

00:31.840 --> 00:45.017
University, one of the series of the oral history 
project concerning the College of Veterinary

00:31.840 --> 00:45.017
Medicine. Today is June 12, 1980, and this is Terry 
Anderson. Could you tell us about your early life?

00:52.386 --> 00:54.509
You were born in Laredo, or grew up in Laredo. I was 
born in Laredo, and I was one of six boys born to my

00:54.529 --> 01:01.678
mother.

01:04.645 --> 01:05.286
No girls.

01:08.530 --> 01:12.055
My father was a rancher in South Texas. So I 
acquired a love for animals at a very early age in my

01:12.075 --> 01:20.207
existence. What type of ranch? It was a 2,640

01:21.989 --> 01:27.197
acres cattle ranch. He also operated a dairy. It 
was a Jersey dairy. And so that's where I was born

01:32.793 --> 01:38.659
and reared, in this type of environment. What type 
of cattle? He had in his dairy only jerseys, and for

01:41.162 --> 01:46.888
beef he raised breamons.

01:52.934 --> 02:01.483
Ultimately crossing these, because the jerseys 
were very good milkers and they were able to wean

01:52.934 --> 02:01.483
some pretty heavy calves. As a matter of fact, we 
still own, my brother and I own 640 acres in Webb

02:03.404 --> 02:10.293
County. And I try to go back there maybe twice a year 
or so. But that's the background. What happened to

02:20.487 --> 02:22.210
the rest of the ranch? Well, we sold 2,000 acres in 
1947.

02:30.501 --> 02:31.943
I went to school in Laredo. And I graduated from 
Martin High School there. That was the only high

02:35.600 --> 02:38.562
school in Laredo at that time. When was that? When 
did you graduate? I graduated in 1942.

02:45.049 --> 02:47.972
And in September of that year, I entered A&M.

02:51.235 --> 02:55.419
And it was my intent to be a chemical engineer. Why 
did you come to A&M? Why did you choose A&M? Well, I

02:59.767 --> 03:11.082
chose A&M, I suppose it was at the urging of one of my 
high school teachers who was very influential in

02:59.767 --> 03:11.082
my life. He was a chemistry teacher, and he thought 
that I would do very well in chemical engineering,

03:12.264 --> 03:24.120
but that wasn't my bag.

03:26.716 --> 03:27.537
I stayed here. Was that one of your good fields in 
high school? Oh, yeah. I did very well in chemistry

03:32.626 --> 03:37.174
in high school and physics and math. And then I 
attended A&M from September 1942

03:39.398 --> 03:52.099
until the Marines called me. And I entered the 
Marines in May of 1944. So you

03:57.143 --> 04:03.653
were drafted then? I was drafted. Could you 
describe the campus during the Second World War?

04:08.561 --> 04:18.778
Well, you see, when I came here in 1942,

04:08.561 --> 04:18.778
we had a total of enrollment, enrollment of around 
6,500. I can't tell you with any degree of

04:20.957 --> 04:25.704
precision about this. No, no, that's about right. 
It's about 6,500. And of course, we were all boys.

04:31.573 --> 04:38.763
And all the freshmen were assigned to specific 
ROTC units. And I was assigned to be chemical

04:39.003 --> 04:41.747
warfare. And each one of these units occupied 
specifically designated dorms. And I lived in

04:50.213 --> 04:57.304
dorm three

04:50.213 --> 04:57.304
for a long time. And then at that time on this campus 
there was a lot of activity on the part of the

04:58.686 --> 05:15.512
military because they had a lot of people here who 
were involved in what they called at that time the

04:58.686 --> 05:15.512
Army Specialized Training Program, ASTP.

05:17.872 --> 05:34.876
And these people were

05:17.872 --> 05:34.876
college graduates who were inducted as privates 
and who were attending

05:17.872 --> 05:34.876
courses here on this campus. Some of them were 
about to receive their degrees. Not all of them had

05:39.402 --> 05:41.525
completed their degrees. Some of them, I suppose 
they were in their final year or the final two

05:41.585 --> 05:46.292
years.

05:52.600 --> 05:57.126
Yeah, I think I would like to revise a little bit 
what I told you. If I remember correctly, these

05:57.506 --> 06:09.301
ASTP boys were picked for their senior ROTC and 
inducted into the service. Some of them into the

06:10.322 --> 06:12.525
Air Force, some of them into the Army. It was sort of 
an officer's training school? Yes, they were

06:17.752 --> 06:22.017
being trained in their final undergraduate years 
by the service with the stipulation that upon

06:22.469 --> 06:35.761
completion of their degree requirements, they 
would enter the service and pay back some of this

06:22.469 --> 06:35.761
time, see. That was the deal.

06:41.826 --> 06:52.476
We had on this campus the Air Force candidates and 
Army, but I don't recall having seen any Navy B-12

06:53.030 --> 06:55.473
program people here. At any rate, when those 
people went on to complete their degree

06:56.635 --> 07:08.590
requirements, they were simply picked up and they 
were compelled to serve for some time. That was the

07:09.612 --> 07:12.395
intent, you see. But then, as you know, the war 
ended in 1945 and a lot of those people were just

07:20.873 --> 07:33.893
released without having to pay back any of this 
time, only to be recalled at some later date, like

07:20.873 --> 07:33.893
the Korean emergency.

07:33.913 --> 07:40.322
So in those days now, we had a very strict 
discipline here on this campus. The

07:40.362 --> 07:43.106
upperclassmen was king, as you know, the senior.

07:46.011 --> 07:48.214
We still had a lot of hazing. For example, what kind 
of hazing? Well, I mean, the type of hazing we had

07:50.317 --> 07:58.108
was in the strictest traditions of A&M at that 
time. That is to say, the freshmen wore a fish

07:59.150 --> 08:13.591
stripe on the cuff of their sleeve, on their shirt 
sleeve, and they were not permitted to use the

07:59.150 --> 08:13.591
sidewalks.

08:16.976 --> 08:18.538
We had to function as room orderlies for the 
upperclassmen, bring their mail, clean their

08:19.750 --> 08:29.160
room, make out their laundry, take it to the 
laundry, bring it back.

08:33.085 --> 08:47.260
During mealtimes, we were compelled to give them 
what they called meal service, and you as a

08:33.085 --> 08:47.260
freshman could not partake of any food, you see, 
until every upperclassman at your table had been

08:33.085 --> 08:47.260
served. And those things, besides the board 
beatings, we got a heck of a lot of board beatings,

08:48.792 --> 08:59.287
you know. They used to break out a board and any 
upperclassmen who outranked another one could

08:59.568 --> 09:08.641
order a butt tear, see. They'd line them up and whip 
everybody with a board. That was traditional and

09:13.087 --> 09:17.213
it was very common. we uh we used to to march to each 
meal there was no one at A&M here who was not in

09:19.538 --> 09:45.580
uniform those people that attended A&M and were 
unable to qualify for a commission because of some

09:19.538 --> 09:45.580
physical disability wore on their collars here an 
NM which meant non-military You see? But they

09:47.699 --> 09:50.282
still lived in the military dorm. No kidding. Yes, 
sir. Now the student population of A&M went down

09:51.924 --> 10:05.401
from about 6,500 to about, I think it was about 
2,500 during the war, basically because

09:51.924 --> 10:05.401
young men were being drafted. Yes. Also, I didn't 
know that it had reached that lower figure, but

10:16.458 --> 10:21.704
A lot of, a lot of officers were being produced here 
at this university. And this university produced

10:22.525 --> 10:32.037
more officers than any other service academy in 
the United States and any other military school.

10:32.057 --> 10:37.764
As a matter of fact, as you well know, the 
commanding general of Corregidor was an Aggie,

10:32.057 --> 10:37.764
General George Moore. Now were you happy to be 
drafted or did you want to continue? No, I wanted to

10:43.272 --> 10:52.205
finish my undergraduate work, but unfortunately 
the war was not looking too good in those days. They

10:52.805 --> 11:06.705
deployed a lot of young men, and in those days when I 
was called for active duty, I was given the choice

10:52.805 --> 11:06.705
of serving in the Navy or the Marines. And I chose 
the Marines. Why? Well, I chose Marines for many

11:12.618 --> 11:17.404
reasons. I was attracted to the Marines because of 
the stringent discipline that they exercised and

11:17.424 --> 11:34.103
because I knew that the Marine divisions were 
deployed in the Pacific, and I felt that if I

11:17.424 --> 11:34.103
volunteered for the Navy, I don't like cold 
climates, and I didn't know where I would serve, so

11:34.522 --> 11:45.096
I knew that if I joined the Marines I would always 
remain in a tropical or subtropical climate. And

11:46.858 --> 12:00.095
because of the fact that I thought that my military 
training at A&M, of which I had had two years, might

11:46.858 --> 12:00.095
give me a chance to go to the Marine Officer's 
Candidate School. And did it? No.

12:05.504 --> 12:10.232
I was a private in the Marines, and after 17 months I 
was promoted to PFC. I served in the Marines about

12:11.554 --> 12:13.116
two years. Got out in 1946. Where were you 
stationed? I was stationed on Guam. Well, I got my

12:21.370 --> 12:24.675
boot training in San Diego, California. Then they 
sent me to Guam, where the 3rd Marine Division was

12:26.218 --> 12:30.685
based. the 3rd Marine Division had already 
participated in two operations in Bougainville

12:32.993 --> 12:38.479
and in Guam. So when we arrived there in December 
1944, they were just cleaning up. The Japanese

12:46.449 --> 12:49.953
stragglers still remained on the island. And from 
that base on Guam, we participated in the invasion

12:51.655 --> 13:02.427
of Iwo Jima, which was the hardest battle that the 
Marine Corps had ever fought in its history. And

13:09.527 --> 13:13.272
you were in that battle? I participated as a member 
of the 9th Marine Regiment, and I was in the 1st

13:13.292 --> 13:23.526
Battalion, Charlie Company.

13:26.350 --> 13:31.097
We landed on that island on the 19th of February, 
1945, and after a very, very severe battle in which

13:32.309 --> 14:00.645
many Aggies died, some of whose names are on the 
list outside of the Memorial Student Center, we

13:32.309 --> 14:00.645
then secured the island on the 6th of April, and 
then we returned to Guam. And then the war ended

14:02.667 --> 14:06.271
that year, 1945. Were you in infantry then? Yes, I 
was a machine gunner. Oh, really?

14:17.624 --> 14:27.876
Then I was assigned, believe it or not, to the 
Marine Corps headquarters in Washington, D.C.

14:17.624 --> 14:27.876
And then... After Guam? After Guam. And in 
February of 1946, I was released from the Marines.

14:35.992 --> 14:42.540
My father at that time was dying of cancer, and he 
subsequently died in November of that year. And

14:42.560 --> 14:57.038
then in June of 47, I returned to A&M as a student, 
this time as a pre-veterinary medical student. In

14:57.058 --> 14:57.919
1948, I was accepted into the College of 
Veterinary Medicine. I received my degree here in

15:00.840 --> 15:02.882
1952. Okay, now let's go back a minute here. When 
you came in 1942, what was your course of study?

15:16.479 --> 15:16.980
Engineering? Chemical engineering, yeah. And 
then why and when did you change? When I was in Guam,

15:21.365 --> 15:27.973
my father bought a 2,000 acre ranch that I joined 
ours. and uh he had so many cattle that

15:29.371 --> 15:42.607
it caused me to reconsider and I wrote a letter to 
Mr. H.L. Heaton who was registrar here from Guam

15:42.627 --> 15:49.875
and I told him that I wanted to change my major from 
C.H.E. chemical engineering to veterinary

15:50.997 --> 15:58.686
medicine and he wrote me a nice letter and told me I 
would have to go through a selection process and to

15:59.189 --> 16:06.199
take a lot of pre-vet courses and all that. So it was 
then established by 1940, 46,

16:06.219 --> 16:23.425
47 that I would pursue a career in veterinary 
medicine or at least in pre-veterinary medicine.

16:25.109 --> 16:28.652
And, of course, I didn't know that I was going to be 
selected the first time. I was working towards an

16:30.073 --> 16:43.024
agricultural education degree as

16:30.073 --> 16:43.024
a contingency in the event I were rejected by the 
College of Animal Medicine. And then you go out and

16:43.084 --> 16:45.126
teach? Agricultural education. But I was very 
lucky to have been accepted the first time. Now,

16:51.591 --> 16:54.694
can you tell me about the acceptance process? 
Well, at that time, we had a committee. Did you have

16:57.550 --> 16:58.492
interviews? Yeah, we had interviews. Everybody 
was interviewed. And uh...

17:05.762 --> 17:09.187
I remember some of the people on my committee. That 
is to say, on the selection committee.

17:14.915 --> 17:24.208
Dr. Jaggi, Dr. Burns, Dr. Sam Cruz,

17:14.915 --> 17:24.208
and uh...

17:26.821 --> 17:56.423
I believe it was those were three of my selection 
committee members in 1948 and

17:26.821 --> 17:56.423
uh the the questions that they ask you your 
selection was based on not only on your grades but

17:26.821 --> 17:56.423
also on the on the interview well they asked me for 
example one of the questions that I remember

17:26.821 --> 17:56.423
they're asking me is if you were selected for 
admission to the College of Veterinary Medicine

17:57.128 --> 18:21.398
would you choose to be a large animal practitioner 
or a small animal practitioner and I think that

17:57.128 --> 18:21.398
that same question is being asked today in some 
form or another I don't know that but some of the

17:57.128 --> 18:21.398
students that have been before the committee have 
told me My answer to that question was that I didn't

18:22.711 --> 18:32.884
know enough about veterinary medicine to make a 
choice before I was even admitted into the College

18:22.711 --> 18:32.884
of Veterinary Medicine. And that I would defer my 
choice until I was in the third year of my

18:32.904 --> 18:40.074
professional work. By that time I felt that I 
should have enough information that would steer

18:40.995 --> 18:46.222
me one way or another. And they accepted that 
answer and they liked my, my, my candor

18:55.499 --> 18:56.320
And I was selected. In my class there were a lot of 
veterans. I would think so. Very highly

19:02.768 --> 19:06.253
intelligent people. And I was very fortunate to be 
accepted because I was in with a lot of people who

19:08.516 --> 19:19.870
who had demonstrated academic ability.

19:25.874 --> 19:29.119
Now, did you eventually get your bachelor's 
degree? No. No, I came very close to getting a

19:29.700 --> 19:36.030
bachelor's degree in ag education. The only thing 
that I lacked in order to complete my requirements

19:36.050 --> 19:42.359
for a degree in ag ed were practice teaching. Oh, 
really? Yeah, I took many, many courses in ag ed. I

19:49.650 --> 19:50.652
enjoyed it very much. I've always enjoyed working 
around county agents and agricultural people,

19:55.287 --> 19:59.594
you know, having been born and reared in a rural 
area.

20:04.803 --> 20:19.827
And after I got out of here, in 1952, I wrote five 
letters

20:04.803 --> 20:19.827
applying for five different jobs, and I was 
accepted by all five. Where were they? What type of

20:23.025 --> 20:23.806
jobs? Well, they were all small animals, small 
animals. I was accepted by one of the outstanding

20:28.332 --> 20:37.024
practitioners in Miami, Florida, a fellow by the 
name of Charlie Bild, B-I-L-D. He was...

20:37.044 --> 20:46.877
he was a very highly respected small animal 
practitioner, and and also by a man in Louisiana

20:48.292 --> 21:01.326
who was an A&M graduate, and then also a doctor who 
signed my license there, Dr. Childress. He was

21:02.368 --> 21:16.223
practicing here in Texas, and he accepted me, but 
the one that I was attracted to the most was

21:02.368 --> 21:16.223
California, and I practiced in Hollywood, 
California immediately after I got out of A&M. and

21:16.388 --> 21:20.012
I had a lot of movie stars as my clients. I went, I 
went in to work for an established older

21:21.594 --> 21:39.836
practitioner who had two veterinary hospitals 
and one of them was right across the street from the

21:21.594 --> 21:39.836
Republic Studios on Ventura Boulevard and that's 
where, that's where I went. I was very happy there.

21:43.440 --> 21:45.703
Let's, let's go back to Now, I looked at the list of 
commencement ceremonies from 1920, and the first

21:46.291 --> 22:04.657
Mexican-American I found was a Ralph Gomez from 
Bryan, who graduated in 1936, and now it seems like

21:46.291 --> 22:04.657
he's in Tulsa, Oklahoma. And by the time you 
graduated in 1952, it seems like you were only

22:05.338 --> 22:11.927
about the fifth or sixth Mexican-American who 
graduated here now we did have some Cubans and we

22:12.329 --> 22:41.627
had some Puerto Ricans that graduated here and so I 
was wondering uh why we have so few to begin with no I

22:12.329 --> 22:41.627
I'm gonna have to disagree with you there because 
there were a lot many more Mexican Americans than

22:12.329 --> 22:41.627
that number that you quoted and I'm going to tell 
you why I know that okay because you see we used to

22:12.329 --> 22:41.627
have the Laredo A&M club and the Laredo A&M club was 
made up were composed of Mexican-American

22:43.852 --> 22:49.860
students primarily. But I'm talking about vet 
school. Oh, in the vet school? In the vet school.

22:54.186 --> 22:56.369
I'm not talking about A&M. Oh, you're probably 
right there, as a matter of fact. I'm just talking

22:59.834 --> 23:01.877
about— I know only one other. I'm just talking 
about people who graduated with a doctorate. I'm

23:07.464 --> 23:13.032
not talking about— The only other 
Mexican-American that I know that is finished

23:14.243 --> 23:22.155
from here, well, I'll bet that even today you won't 
find half a dozen. Why?

23:27.843 --> 23:33.091
Well,

23:27.843 --> 23:33.091
that's a tough question to answer.

23:37.678 --> 23:40.162
First of all, this fellow Gomez, when did he 
finish? 1936. 1936. And I know that there was

23:42.603 --> 23:49.033
another man by the name of Martinez from 
Heavenville. I knew him personally. Oh, did you

23:50.595 --> 23:51.396
know him? Yeah, he was the second one that I found in 
1937. Yeah, that's right. That's exactly right.

23:59.209 --> 24:10.086
He was, as a matter of fact, I called him several 
times for veterinary assistance when I was

23:59.209 --> 24:10.086
operating my father's dairy.

24:11.686 --> 24:12.387
Yeah. That guy's a judge now, a county judge. Is he a 
county judge? Yes, sir. Now, I personally taught

24:17.995 --> 24:25.005
a Mexican-American here by the name of Garza. His 
name was Gilberto Garza. He finished here in 1958.

24:29.571 --> 24:30.432
Oh, okay. Well, I only went up to you. I only went up 
to 1952. I didn't continue on. But why do you, let's

24:37.702 --> 24:39.705
get back to that question. Why do you think there's 
been so few Well I don't know how to answer that

24:42.989 --> 25:09.300
question

24:42.989 --> 25:09.300
I know that there have been a lot of 
Mexican-Americans interested in veterinary

24:42.989 --> 25:09.300
medicine but I suppose the reason the most obvious 
reason is that that maybe their grades haven't

24:42.989 --> 25:09.300
been good enough to entitle them to an interview 
which is basal it's primal to to the selection of a

25:09.922 --> 25:38.494
student for the professional curriculum is that 
he that a grade point average be so high that he

25:09.922 --> 25:38.494
merits an interview there's been a lot of people 
here from Laredo that have tried to be

25:09.922 --> 25:38.494
veterinarians they come across the same 
obstacles that any other kid comes across I think I

25:09.922 --> 25:38.494
really believe that the only way that we would have 
a higher uh proportion of Mexican-Americans

25:39.352 --> 25:54.060
entering the College of Veterinary Medicine is if 
they were recruited at the high school level and

25:39.352 --> 25:54.060
interested in veterinary medicine. And we don't 
have a program like that, do we? To my knowledge,

25:55.883 --> 25:58.127
no. To my knowledge, there isn't. I believe that we 
would also have a higher percentage of blacks that

26:02.487 --> 26:15.945
might be interested in veterinary medicine, but 
to my knowledge this university doesn't have an

26:02.487 --> 26:15.945
active recruitment program for minorities, and I 
think that they should. I think that when people

26:17.667 --> 26:30.604
tell me, well, the reason why Mexican-Americans 
don't choose veterinary medicine as a career is

26:17.667 --> 26:30.604
that they know they're not intellectually 
qualified, and I consider that to be bullshit.

26:35.093 --> 26:39.036
I myself was in the top ten percent of my class here. 
And when I went to get a Ph.D., I finished number one

26:40.457 --> 26:44.741
in my class at Michigan State. It's not that they 
don't possess a mental aptitude. It's just that

26:49.726 --> 26:58.954
they feel that the career is very long and maybe 
they come from lower income families and maybe

26:59.812 --> 27:05.338
they feel that they ought to select a career that 
will enable them to get a job in four years. I don't

27:05.838 --> 27:07.040
know what the reasons are. There's probably a 
multiplicity of reasons. Yes, yes. Did you feel

27:11.424 --> 27:23.257
when you came here, first as an undergraduate, and 
then as one student of the vet school, did you feel

27:11.424 --> 27:23.257
that you were discriminated against in any way? 
Dr. Anderson, that business of discrimination on

27:23.277 --> 27:28.182
this campus is rampant. It is today rampant, and in 
those days it was worse. Can you give me some

27:34.671 --> 27:37.034
examples? Oh, there's, there's so many, you know, 
there's so many subtle ways in which

27:37.054 --> 27:43.102
discrimination can be practiced. It is, it is 
quite difficult sometimes to, to identify

27:45.045 --> 27:56.380
specifically

27:45.045 --> 27:56.380
the reason for the discrimination or the 
instances of discrimination. I feel that, well,

28:00.123 --> 28:07.255
You tell me a single Mexican-American on this 
university campus that has any positional

28:00.123 --> 28:07.255
responsibility. Name me one. I can't. I'm not an 
expert. This state is composed of 30%

28:14.849 --> 28:19.156
Mexican-Americans.

28:20.959 --> 28:24.966
We don't have anybody here that's a 
Mexican-American in positional

28:20.959 --> 28:24.966
responsibility.

28:29.131 --> 28:36.241
American in Hernandez, I think his name was. Danny 
Hernandez. I think that's his name. But he's

28:42.871 --> 28:54.107
supposed to be equal employment officer or 
something like that.

28:56.009 --> 28:58.513
But aside from that, I have gone through the 
faculty

28:59.945 --> 29:12.302
roster, to find out how many people here are 
teaching at A&M that have a Spanish surname.

29:15.066 --> 29:27.724
Now, just a short time ago, the office of the vice 
president for academic affairs claimed that

29:15.066 --> 29:27.724
there were 140 minority people. teaching here on 
this university campus. A hundred and forty?

29:31.452 --> 29:37.499
Yeah, but I've gone through that book there, and I 
can only find about five or six with a Spanish

29:31.452 --> 29:37.499
surname.

29:43.305 --> 29:48.870
Oh, uh... Well, could you give me some examples 
when you were here back in the, back in the 40s, and

29:43.305 --> 29:48.870
then when you got here? Of discrimination? No. 
Well, I guess one of the outstanding examples was a

29:57.050 --> 29:59.153
fellow who was in my dorm. He was classified as a 
junior. He's now, he became a veterinarian, you

30:04.741 --> 30:07.945
know. That's ironic, you know. It really is 
ironic. But in those days we were, you know,

30:11.210 --> 30:14.234
teenagers. And this guy really had it in for 
Mexicans. He said he had killed several of them on

30:19.501 --> 30:22.445
his father's ranch. That's what he told me. He 
couldn't tolerate them around him.

30:31.362 --> 30:44.766
That fellow then went on to become veterinarian,

30:31.362 --> 30:44.766
and the irony of this thing is that I became a member 
of the teaching staff here, and we met at

30:31.362 --> 30:44.766
professional conventions. As a matter of fact, 
there was one guy in my class who never spoke to me

30:51.623 --> 30:58.474
for four years, that we went together every day to 
the same classes. Is this in vet school? In vet

30:59.476 --> 31:00.598
school. The first one was in 1943 or 44. 44. That was 
the first example. And this example is in vet

31:08.110 --> 31:10.374
school. In vet school, yeah. He never spoke to me.

31:19.720 --> 31:49.643
when we were see he he joined our class from the 
class that was supposed to finish ahead of ours he

31:19.720 --> 31:49.643
failed of course and therefore was uh was put back a 
year you know and he joined our class now this guy I

31:19.720 --> 31:49.643
don't know he he had it in for Mexican Americans and 
of course

31:19.720 --> 31:49.643
I never made any effort to cultivate his 
friendship and we went like that for four years he

31:51.833 --> 32:11.310
never spoke to me during four years we were here 
except in the final month when our graduation was a

31:51.833 --> 32:11.310
certainty then he
