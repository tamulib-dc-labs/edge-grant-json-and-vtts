WEBVTT

00:01.600 --> 00:03.862
Then let the army do it. You cannot run the 
battlefield from the White House. I don't care

00:07.085 --> 00:08.006
who's president. It's the big fancy word today is 
micromanagement. We didn't know what it was then,

00:12.069 --> 00:13.791
but they were doing it.

00:17.034 --> 00:18.395
That's not how you get there from here. Give your 
units an assignment for which they're trained to

00:20.897 --> 00:24.681
do.

00:28.504 --> 00:31.607
In wartime, things happen wrong and examples You 
may get 50 Arabic linguists sent to a war in Vietnam

00:32.060 --> 00:38.308
because they finished language school and 
everybody's going to Vietnam. Why, you learned

00:40.110 --> 00:44.715
Arabic and I learned Vietnamese, but sir, it took 
me two years to learn that one. Learn this one, you

00:45.016 --> 00:46.818
got a year while you're here. Start 
interrogations at 2 o'clock a day. Hi, I'm down

00:50.823 --> 00:51.784
here. You got any Arabs for me to interrogate?

00:56.309 --> 00:58.452
These accidents happen. The sheer numbers. You 
try to get between the perfect and the imperfect.

01:04.200 --> 01:05.441
There's some compromise out there. Hopefully the 
ideal prevails a little bit. Sometimes it

01:08.304 --> 01:11.106
doesn't. On that train of thought,

01:11.126 --> 01:24.177
I've heard or it's been said that Vietnam, the war 
was managed rather than... Oh, yeah. It was war by

01:24.217 --> 01:26.239
management. And that's where the body counts, the 
ratio of management. I can scale it. and measure

01:30.093 --> 01:30.854
you. Wars are won or lost on leadership. That's the 
difference between the American units, even

01:34.058 --> 01:39.505
though the advisory program was management. You 
were in the woods if the decision was wrong. You

01:44.211 --> 01:48.997
were out there with their unit you were peddling 
your good expert advice to. They may not just take

01:50.780 --> 01:52.602
it. No, sir, we don't want any of that today. Then 
you had to see if you were smart enough to get the

01:56.367 --> 02:00.972
same advice, figure out another way to get there.

02:04.015 --> 02:04.956
It hangs on leaders. It falls on leaders. All wars 
do. Never seen a manager win one yet. So what do you

02:12.445 --> 02:23.657
think about the bombing, the effect that the 
American firepower had, in particular on the way

02:12.445 --> 02:23.657
that the South Vietnamese viewed the U.S. troops 
in the United States? How did it affect you,

02:28.077 --> 02:32.325
especially since you were working with MACV? 
Well, where we were, where I was in MACV, we did not

02:32.385 --> 02:43.423
have, in III Corps, in Saigon, Benoit, Jardin, 
which was the west of, we were in Benoit. We did not

02:43.884 --> 02:47.750
have this mass firepower of American units. We 
were in the pacified region. There was no effect on

02:49.093 --> 02:50.455
us. uh you didn't see b-52 sorters you could see the 
planes go over uh one of the things is the

02:51.059 --> 03:20.830
vietnamese i think by us making them miniature 
copies relied on our technology artificially

02:51.059 --> 03:20.830
introduced into their system when we left we took 
our goodies with us you know if there was a problem

02:51.059 --> 03:20.830
in vietnam it wasn't the problem of how to fight 
even though there was a problem there It wasn't a

03:22.008 --> 03:23.931
problem of should we fight. I think if anybody sees 
an attack going on that we perceived, and I hope we

03:23.991 --> 03:31.741
were right, you get in. The problem was the way we 
left. If we're going to turn the war over to win for

03:36.227 --> 03:44.038
yourselves because we can't stand the pain any 
longer because too many of us are dying of being

03:36.227 --> 03:44.038
crippled. Good luck, suckers. And now the good 
news. We're leaving. The bad news is we're taking

03:48.163 --> 03:50.867
our toys with us. The Toys R Us store was closed. 
Weapons R Us quit being Weapons R Us. We didn't

03:57.578 --> 03:59.461
supply the B-52s for them. We couldn't supply that 
quality that was missing in the Army leadership.

04:05.730 --> 04:09.816
It was missing in ours at the same time, possibly.

04:10.357 --> 04:14.564
I think the outcome based on what we did to the Army 
was a foregone conclusion. It was... Senator

04:18.050 --> 04:21.054
Aiken from Vermont said, if you're going to leave, 
just leave. Declare yourself a winner and come

04:21.074 --> 04:22.375
home. We did. Peace with honor.

04:33.508 --> 04:40.997
Was there anything in particular that stands out 
in your mind as far as... I know we talked about

04:41.017 --> 04:45.002
morale a little bit, but... especially when you 
were working as an advisor, that had a very

04:46.838 --> 05:00.156
positive effect on the RFPF forces that you were 
utilizing? Well, I think the biggest effect we had

05:00.176 --> 05:15.057
in that area was we retrained the NCO and others at 
the local level, at the district level. sent some

05:16.808 --> 05:27.438
RF units through our own in-house training, 
scrounged up the extra ammo, the guns, the

05:16.808 --> 05:27.438
uniforms, ran them through what would amount to 
our boot camp. Never mind the bull that goes with

05:29.860 --> 05:32.682
boot camp. Run them through. Everybody's already 
got a rifle. Now they're all the same. We want to

05:35.425 --> 05:37.287
show you what M16s can do. Run them through it and 
see the morale difference in the unit. Now they can

05:40.650 --> 05:42.572
get ammunition. They've got all the weapons of the 
same. They've got the best. We're carrying them,

05:46.173 --> 05:48.756
but they're carrying them. They got rid of the 
bolt-action rifle, the nine kinds of ammo,

05:48.776 --> 05:53.902
everybody looking like a rag muffin. They looked 
like an army. I think that was probably the biggest

05:56.546 --> 06:02.893
success a sergeant working down there with me ever 
did. Run them through it. We'd go out there, we'd

06:05.056 --> 06:06.377
run them through it. He runs them through it. I'm 
the officer. I stand there with their officer and

06:08.240 --> 06:09.761
watch. He runs them. It's then going back in the 
village with them. and seeing these units fight

06:15.517 --> 06:20.161
communists on a local level, act like an army. 
Instead of acting like 20-year-old kids,

06:21.062 --> 06:32.271
20-year-old men, 10-year-old dogs crippled up, 
old age, over the hill, they gained this

06:21.062 --> 06:32.271
togetherness. Their equipment they knew was 
going to work. We scroungers used magazines, and

06:35.934 --> 06:40.218
how we got them, you know, scrounging was a way of 
life. When you were through training them, they

06:42.399 --> 06:44.361
looked good. They acted better. They were an army. 
They weren't a collection.

06:51.065 --> 07:02.423
And I would think if I had one thing I'd point a 
finger at and say, yes, there's something about an

06:51.065 --> 07:02.423
RFPF unit I can stick my fingers on, they looked 
like a military unit instead of a bunch of people

06:51.065 --> 07:02.423
out for weekend drill.

07:07.812 --> 07:11.578
Uh, seriously, I kind of lost my train of thought.

07:16.992 --> 07:43.084
the

07:16.992 --> 07:43.084
uh do you think that i know i noticed you mentioned a 
while ago that you felt like that at the hamlet

07:16.992 --> 07:43.084
level the rfp forces they were the key to our 
success or they would have should have been or

07:16.992 --> 07:43.084
could have been they were where we went in live with 
them work with them necessarily died with them

07:16.992 --> 07:43.084
they were the keys because the village the hamlet 
in vietnam was that's the center of their universe

07:43.857 --> 08:06.439
not this abstraction called national government 
in saigon that's the french-american creation

07:43.857 --> 08:06.439
there was only one person known to everybody in 
vietnam was ho chi minh bao dai was well known also

07:43.857 --> 08:06.439
southerner Once you got past that, it was the 
Vietnamese generals who were favored by the

08:07.988 --> 08:18.142
Americans, and if we didn't like you one day, we 
killed you off or replaced you in the next coup.

08:18.162 --> 08:22.588
It's at the village, the Vietnamese, the graves, 
the ancestors are there. Life evolved about spot

08:22.848 --> 08:30.298
X, Y, the village, the hamlet. That's where you won 
the hearts and minds, if that's what we're going to

08:30.318 --> 08:35.245
talk about, winning in the war. You convinced them 
to quit straddling the fence, and 80% of them sat on

08:36.001 --> 08:40.946
the metal and watched. Let's get them off the 
fence. Whoever gets them off the fence wins the

08:42.788 --> 08:44.910
war. It didn't matter what happened in the jungle, 
what happened in the towns with the guns, the big

08:47.332 --> 08:52.016
army fights. It's out there. I'm winning them five 
at a time, ten at a time, or I'm losing them. I saw a

08:59.223 --> 09:03.507
quote

08:59.223 --> 09:03.507
on a film. I don't remember the name of it. 
Westmoreland made the statement

09:06.072 --> 09:22.831
that the value of life to Asians was not, they 
didn't place as great a value on life as Westerners

09:06.072 --> 09:22.831
do. What do you think about that statement? Well, 
first, I think something you need to look at in a

09:24.453 --> 09:31.400
question like that, part of it's going to be a 
religious answer. If you're a Buddhist, You're

09:34.912 --> 09:39.118
coming back again and again and again until you 
obtain perfection. Life's not one trip through.

09:45.006 --> 09:52.336
The next thing is, if you're a communist commander 
and all you have is people to throw at our

09:45.006 --> 09:52.336
high-firepower technology, you throw a mass of 
people at it. There was a difference in value

09:54.018 --> 09:55.460
there. Not to say that we would not expend you for a 
target. We did. It's just that we don't hang signs

10:02.603 --> 10:16.260
on it and say, hey, dear Ms. Smith, we just spent 
Johnny and 24 of the men in an aerial recon scout

10:02.603 --> 10:16.260
platoon so we could find 1,000 communists and kill 
them. We sent the scouts out, and your job in life

10:16.280 --> 10:20.946
was radio back and say, boss, we found them. Give me 
your grid, quick. That was your job in the war. Did

10:25.532 --> 10:25.852
that happen? Sure it happens. You mean when you 
breathe? There's no rescue. You last 30 seconds.

10:33.164 --> 10:34.446
The unit's still in the area. We're not going to get 
out there with a thousand men to rescue you. We sent

10:38.212 --> 10:40.135
you probing. Johnny, it's take the stick and go 
poke in the woods and find me something. When you

10:45.563 --> 10:47.025
find it, phone me. Now, it's the intel types that 
try to guess what did you find. Sir, I think they

10:53.600 --> 10:55.303
found the big one. We better get out there. And 
everybody piled on. We were air mobile. We could

10:58.890 --> 11:03.378
fly you from Bryan to here anywhere 10 miles, 20 
miles, 30 miles, 40 miles rapidly. But not rapidly

11:04.019 --> 11:05.723
enough to save that unit. It just went out there. 
But that's okay. Look how we cover it. The platoon

11:10.331 --> 11:11.573
was annihilated. That was the usual case. Or badly 
shot at, militarily unaffected. But when you did

11:17.157 --> 11:20.224
the company back, it lost one out of four platoons. 
It's ineffective. The battalion lost one platoon

11:21.407 --> 11:25.277
out of 19, 20, however many was in a battalion. The 
brigade lost one platoon out of its 50 platoons or

11:25.317 --> 11:30.229
200. The brigade didn't even miss them. And that 
night on the 5 o'clock briefing, you were a

11:34.083 --> 11:36.926
pinpoint. Yes, sir, we made contact with the enemy 
this morning. It commenced at 0900, whatever time

11:39.689 --> 11:42.111
it started. And we're piling on, sir. The initial 
report was we lost 20 men killed. We've now killed

11:47.036 --> 11:48.938
several hundred of them. The fight continues. It 
may take four, five, six days to play it out.

11:52.702 --> 11:56.726
Somewhere along the way, the enemy starts to 
withdraw because you replied your superior

11:52.702 --> 11:56.726
firepower. They're breaking off contact. 
They're sneaking away. A little carriage won't

11:59.009 --> 12:00.510
stand up and fight. In about a week, it's all over 
with big battles. And when you threw, nobody knows

12:05.572 --> 12:08.217
who that platoon was that disappeared. They just 
gone. Did they, when after the platoon made

12:11.683 --> 12:17.192
contact, did they call in the artillery 
immediately? No, they didn't always have it. They

12:18.074 --> 12:21.219
were sometimes in range, sometimes out of range, 
just depending where we sent you. We want you to go

12:23.423 --> 12:24.745
look for it, boys. What patrols do is go out there in 
those spots that aren't covered and look around.

12:30.570 --> 12:31.311
What did you find? We think there's 800 of them out 
there. Go find them. Now, you stir them up good, you

12:34.337 --> 12:35.900
hear. Tippy,

12:35.960 --> 12:43.092
tippy, tippy, tippy, tippy, and then whack, you 
show up. They had figured out pretty quickly all

12:43.112 --> 12:46.939
the places you could land helicopters in. They had 
people watching them. They watched them. You

12:49.891 --> 12:50.912
tried to sneak in. Sometimes you snuck in, 
sometimes you didn't. They didn't want to shoot

12:53.594 --> 12:54.736
you. The asshole laid flat and let you walk by them. 
They want you dead, you're dead. But we traded

13:01.322 --> 13:04.706
those people to get the big numbers.

13:07.769 --> 13:11.853
I wouldn't think in some ways they were any worse 
callous or more callous than us. I think there's a

13:12.394 --> 13:14.356
technology difference. They had to employ more 
people. I don't think any commander loves to throw

13:18.421 --> 13:22.726
away men.

13:31.695 --> 13:35.960
You know, I don't think, and I think that's one of 
the things that I think we had a bad picture. If you

13:36.340 --> 13:39.904
understood that you had five tries to do life or ten 
tries, you could play them differently. You could

13:39.924 --> 13:41.325
learn something every time you come through.

13:44.188 --> 13:46.791
If that's what they believe, then they can afford 
to be different. Regardless of what's true, it's

13:47.328 --> 13:49.490
perception that counts. And the problem we had is 
we had to write letters home to Mayor Smith. Dear

13:54.636 --> 13:56.377
Mayor Smith, Johnny's not going to come back. 
Johnny's on his way home early.

14:01.723 --> 14:07.689
From what I saw on the TV when I would come back in 
Ashford looking at it, we ran the war scores on TV

14:01.723 --> 14:07.689
like a football game. Them on one corner of the 
screen and us on the other. I'm not sure what that

14:12.194 --> 14:16.238
said back here either, except the numbers got 
bigger every year. You know, when you're over

14:17.433 --> 14:19.636
there, you don't know how many men died. You knew 
how many men died in your local area, how many men

14:20.638 --> 14:23.322
was wounded. You didn't have the war toes. It 
wasn't your job to worry about it. Then you come

14:28.649 --> 14:31.053
home and you find out, well, gosh, is this how it 
went? Yeah, home. And it's, so what?

14:39.885 --> 14:41.668
What do you, how do you think that? Or do you think 
the anti-war movement back in the States had an

14:42.914 --> 14:49.643
effect on the troops in Vietnam? When you were 
there, did you realize it was going on? You would

14:53.388 --> 15:01.279
hear in 67 and 68, yeah, we heard. How much an effect 
it had, I'm not sure. Some of the guys held up

15:03.662 --> 15:10.491
pictures of the protesters back home, you know, 
and poked holes through them so you can, you know,

15:10.943 --> 15:14.147
Some came over less willing to die in a place that 
didn't look like it was going to win. I think the

15:14.948 --> 15:26.421
demonstrations back home, from looking backward 
at it, was a turning point signal that the other

15:14.948 --> 15:26.421
side looked at and said, if the American public 
doesn't support the war, we've won.

15:31.688 --> 15:33.430
It's hard to say which happens first. Was the 
public here against the war when the numbers got

15:34.251 --> 15:40.258
too big, the expense got too high? and we'd have 
left anyway, or was that extra shove what

15:41.048 --> 15:44.733
happened? I don't know. You know, still don't. It 
happened. It did have an effect. In the advisory

15:51.343 --> 15:55.228
program, I don't think we paid much mind to it. You 
know, you weren't into worrying about it. Do you

15:59.654 --> 16:03.640
think that the National Guard should have been 
called up? That decision, when Lyndon Johnson,

16:03.660 --> 16:07.866
having made the decision not to call the Guard, 
that settled it. If there's a turning point in the

16:08.588 --> 16:16.699
war, militarily, in thinking, it's the decision 
not to disrupt the national economy by calling the

16:08.588 --> 16:16.699
Guard. I personally believe if you have them, you 
should be able to use them. You should also keep

16:19.503 --> 16:21.185
them trained for that use. They weren't. The Guard 
wasn't trained in that era. It was the place to go if

16:26.493 --> 16:29.717
you didn't want to go. The way to save your butt was 
join the Guard.

16:37.073 --> 16:44.943
If there's ever a thought about that, and I'm going 
to put it in even though it's not in this era, did

16:37.073 --> 16:44.943
Quail avoid going? He damn sure did. And I think one 
of the cartoons on the wall was, had the wall

16:47.686 --> 16:52.852
saying, Dan Quail, where were you? He was home 
saving his butt. If he's a hawk, hawks go. And I

16:58.859 --> 17:01.382
guess I class myself as a hawk, I went. If you're a 
hawk, you eat chickens. And

17:06.200 --> 17:11.547
leave it at that. That's an out of context thing. I 
had made my decisions. I would. I can't climb in

17:17.354 --> 17:20.818
anybody else and answer for them. They have to 
answer for themselves. How did you feel about the

17:25.344 --> 17:29.449
draft doctors? Did that have any effect on you 
after you came back? I recognize you have a right in

17:34.432 --> 17:38.195
our system not to go. I also recognize you may 
choose to break a law and not go and go to jail and pay

17:40.037 --> 17:44.581
your price. They didn't pay.

17:49.685 --> 17:54.990
Personally, I don't like them, but I have to live 
with them, and they have to live with me. So it's

17:57.452 --> 18:01.036
that conflict in American politics that's never 
going to be resolved. The ones that want to go are

18:01.056 --> 18:02.717
going to go.

18:05.752 --> 18:13.624
And think what they think about the ones that went, 
and then, you know, as it turns out, the ones that

18:05.752 --> 18:13.624
didn't go said, say we didn't win, so what were you 
and all your friends dying for? And it's the

18:13.684 --> 18:16.829
unanswerable question. I did not like what they 
did. They have a right to do that. You know, I'll

18:22.839 --> 18:26.264
defend their right to say no. I don't have to like 
you for saying no. That's right. That's

18:32.774 --> 18:33.155
interesting. And... This is like the thing, and I 
had a medic that was a conscientious objector, one

18:34.439 --> 18:39.744
of the best guys I ever knew in my life. Wouldn't 
carry a gun. He served.

18:46.812 --> 18:52.958
I didn't like him because he was a CO, and I make no 
whine about it, but he was a good man, one of the best

18:46.812 --> 18:52.958
I ever had. He did his job. Everybody warned me he 
was different. Being different Didn't kill him,

19:02.789 --> 19:10.037
didn't mark him, but I'm saying, you know, looking 
at it, why don't you carry a gun? I don't believe in

19:11.039 --> 19:13.081
it. Why are you here? I didn't believe in running.

19:18.708 --> 19:21.691
And you have to admire him. I admire him much more 
than I admire the ones either hid in the Garden of

19:21.711 --> 19:31.142
States or tiptoed to Canada or Mexico or anywhere, 
or just hid. You know, I guess I fired it with my last

19:33.552 --> 19:37.816
name, and irony that Stallone becomes famous with 
that name. And at least I've been told that he was in

19:39.417 --> 19:43.781
a girls' school, a dance school in Switzerland. 
Oh, really? But, uh, but see, perception becomes

19:45.843 --> 19:49.085
reality.

19:52.228 --> 20:00.795
And, uh,

19:52.228 --> 20:00.795
you know, it's one of those strange quirks. Well, 
did you, do you think, uh, I think

20:03.320 --> 20:15.396
selective service had to enforce a set of rules 
that had too many loopholes. If asked, do you favor

20:17.159 --> 20:21.645
a draft, my answer is yes, but universal military 
conscription. At age 18, everybody goes. If you

20:24.709 --> 20:27.032
don't want to carry a rifle, I've got plenty of 
bedpans. Plenty of national hospitals. That way

20:29.442 --> 20:32.484
you don't have to wear a uniform and do one thing to 
help a war effort. I am probably opposed to a

20:33.765 --> 20:41.172
volunteer army because I believe they are 
mercenaries, pure and simple, out for a paycheck.

20:41.192 --> 20:42.894
And I prefer one of draftees. Even with the problem 
of education of the draftee, I believe that's the

20:42.954 --> 20:56.766
only way you put your people as a group in touch with 
this side of democracy which says some of us may

20:42.954 --> 20:56.766
have to go die in order for the rest of us to have what 
we consider the good life. I don't think we should

21:01.580 --> 21:05.725
have it on just volunteers. Of course, I recognize 
the law really says in Congress, if there's a war,

21:05.745 --> 21:09.690
we'll draft. I think we should use a draft all the 
time. It leaves you with a large professional

21:14.055 --> 21:18.040
manpower pool if you need it. We're out of that 
manpower pool. The guys from Vietnam are aged 35 to

21:20.643 --> 21:26.010
40, 45, 50.

21:27.256 --> 21:32.803
It's been nearly 20 years since the last large 
units left. If you have to call up reserves, all

21:33.063 --> 21:41.915
you've got left now are the reservists, the guard 
units, the regular Army, and I'm going to call them

21:33.063 --> 21:41.915
the over 40 Vietnam guys. You need a different 
force, I believe, than that to help. And I think a

21:47.802 --> 21:52.909
draft is a way to keep new people entering the 
manpower pool in large numbers. Do you think that

21:55.112 --> 21:56.233
the... because of the the deformance and 
everything that there was a any particular

21:56.973 --> 22:26.912
segment of society that was well sure whittled 
down i think whether it's fair or unfair that is a

21:56.973 --> 22:26.912
matter of fact more blacks and browns and poor 
whites if you want to call them a disadvantage

21:56.973 --> 22:26.912
whatever good name you want to stick on poor or 
others died. You know, one of the problems with

22:30.140 --> 22:36.968
saying, well, it was just purely accidental, was 
we gave deferments. If you had money to stay in

22:37.008 --> 22:39.270
college, you had the IQ. But if you'd graduated in 
that era and didn't want to go to college, you were

22:39.290 --> 22:44.876
battlefield meat. If you were poor, regardless of 
race, you became an infantryman, a mortarman, a

22:44.896 --> 22:52.364
rifleman, the grunt. If you had the education, you 
became an intelligence, became an officer,

22:52.384 --> 22:57.490
became an NCO, something. Also, it should be said 
at the same time, the people wanting out of the

22:58.702 --> 23:11.518
barrio, the ghetto, and off the street, they also 
volunteered to go to those elite units that drew

22:58.702 --> 23:11.518
extra pay because they wanted the money. It was a 
ticket out. A lot of those tickets got punched. It

23:18.947 --> 23:22.271
was an out with a dead end. Others got out. And I 
personally think they paid disproportionately.

23:27.490 --> 23:30.074
And that's why I would go back to the original 
answer, a universal. No holes, no exceptions.

23:34.200 --> 23:36.503
Then we don't have to worry about, why didn't you? 
Won't be anybody. It'll just be you and them or

23:39.147 --> 23:40.610
whatever. When you came back to the States, did you 
have any particular feeling that stood out in your

23:42.312 --> 23:53.589
mind when you

23:42.312 --> 23:53.589
were confronted by the sentiment here? Yeah, I 
would think, you know, you... come back to the West

23:56.802 --> 24:08.754
Coast, go through the airports, find out the guys 
wearing the uniforms, the bad guys, the good guys

23:56.802 --> 24:08.754
were in the street with sticks, weren't the police 
either.

24:12.839 --> 24:21.187
It was, and I guess the biggest resentment part 
was, it was the country kind of in a way said, God, we

24:12.839 --> 24:21.187
sent you, but we sure hate to acknowledge you were 
there. And I think that was the, that's more

24:22.369 --> 24:26.573
damning and more aggravating than whether some 
people in the street didn't like what you did. You

24:30.784 --> 24:31.565
can live with them. It's the official side of it, 
the non-recognition side. Did you feel betrayed

24:36.650 --> 24:38.392
by the government? I'm not sure I ever analyzed it 
up to that point. You didn't have your homecoming

24:41.115 --> 24:44.279
parade, but it wasn't World War II either.

24:47.542 --> 24:51.427
I think the longer it went, the longer you look 
back, the more it may have worked toward that. I

24:51.467 --> 24:52.408
don't like that word. I'm not sure that's the one 
I'd pick. I'm not sure what I'd put in there. Anger

24:57.097 --> 25:05.930
at the government probably didn't do more to solve 
its own problem of it was going to go win or go stay

24:57.097 --> 25:05.930
home. I think long term, you look at the loss of the 
guys you worked with, and you're always going to

25:07.552 --> 25:15.924
have that question. If it was a good cause, and we 
went. They died and paid for a good cause. If it was a

25:24.116 --> 25:25.939
bad cause, why did we go? And I don't think anybody 
who went necessarily, and those in that area who

25:28.417 --> 25:39.592
didn't go, are going to be able to judge out with a 
good, clean answer on either side was it a good or

25:28.417 --> 25:39.592
bad cause. I think it started out with some very 
noble ideals.

25:45.740 --> 25:47.623
I think it evolved into something else. and I'm not 
sure what I would do with it other than saying, I

25:49.983 --> 26:04.857
think, to go back that line, if we're going to go, 
then let's go win, because I think at the time I was

25:49.983 --> 26:04.857
in Vietnam, even in the advisory program, I viewed 
the war as winnable if. Get up and do something. Do

26:06.799 --> 26:10.182
you have any experiences on your return that stand 
out? Anything where you treated? Oh, I think

26:13.245 --> 26:18.370
everybody had a spot where you hit where were you, 
you know, and somebody said, oh, you were,

26:18.923 --> 26:24.250
quote-unquote the baby killer, I think a lot of 
guys bumped into at least one of those. I'm not sure

26:24.270 --> 26:28.416
it's any worse than the draft dodger who went to 
Canada coming back, and he was one of them. I think

26:30.279 --> 26:33.083
every war has a high side and a low side. You know, 
the parade down Main Street is one side of it. And

26:40.493 --> 26:44.058
what do you say about your war? You know, at least 
the first clear loss we suffered in quite a while.

26:49.670 --> 26:57.301
You know, everybody used to remark, and I guess 
particularly the early days in ROTC in the early

26:49.670 --> 26:57.301
60s, wonder what the German Army felt like that 
lost in World War II. Now you know. No. You got your

27:00.646 --> 27:02.109
answer in the 70s. It didn't kill the Army. We went 
through an evolution of leadership. I'm not sure

27:08.238 --> 27:10.942
of management back into leadership now. I'm still 
not sure we've evolved out what picture we want the

27:11.543 --> 27:15.509
Americans to have. When you borrow women from 
combat, but let them take the jump slots and fly the

27:18.577 --> 27:24.544
planes in peacetime that the men will have to do in 
flying wartime. I find that totally ironic. I say

27:27.387 --> 27:30.090
if I can't use them, I don't want them wearing the 
jump wings. I don't want them standing in the door

27:30.230 --> 27:32.172
of my plane. If they can wear the wings and fly the 
planes and pull the trigger, then I want the law

27:32.953 --> 27:40.902
changed that says we're going to put them on the 
front line and treat them just like any other

27:32.953 --> 27:40.902
soldier. You know, I think part of ours is to 
question ourselves of what we want society to be

27:42.904 --> 27:47.689
like. Do you really want your women out there with 
you cutting throats? See, we have these myths we

27:51.855 --> 27:53.878
have in our society. The Tarzan and Jane, whatever 
you want to make it out to be. Now we find out Jane's

27:58.345 --> 28:00.628
maybe a better killer than you are.

28:06.457 --> 28:13.908
Do you think that it was a... that our failure in 
Vietnam was a product of those myths? Do you think

28:13.928 --> 28:17.794
that our culture didn't allow us to win, or... Or 
the myths that we went over there with caused us to

28:18.500 --> 28:22.325
not be able to? Or the myths even got us there in the 
first place? Well, I think the question we said in

28:26.451 --> 28:33.660
World War II was the strategic region of the 
country, of the world. If it was, then it still is.

28:37.966 --> 28:40.649
You're always conditioned by your perception of 
the world. What is it? We were conditioned. We got

28:43.433 --> 28:43.994
there. We had a set of beliefs that didn't fit 
reality. We didn't adjust them. In a way, Vietnam

28:53.031 --> 29:00.518
was to us what the end of the British Empire was to 
them, the ending of World War II. The Empire slips

29:01.039 --> 29:02.260
away.

29:05.524 --> 29:06.825
We did ours a little differently. I think we didn't 
want territory as such, merely want control of the

29:06.885 --> 29:14.073
region. I think you need to decide when you go

29:19.216 --> 29:46.843
what's it worth how much will i will i pay how much am 
i willing to pay where do i draw the line if the line

29:19.216 --> 29:46.843
is to leave short of accomplishment of it then you 
should ask yourself should i go at all and i think

29:19.216 --> 29:46.843
that takes a look at reality that we still may not 
want to face and i think there's been a number of

29:19.216 --> 29:46.843
books written on the limits of american power it 
should be marked with american lives I think you

29:48.882 --> 29:59.072
spend too many Americans in a war that isn't fought 
quickly, and I tell everybody, we like our wars

29:48.882 --> 29:59.072
like football games, four quick quarters and 
sudden overtime, if necessary. But don't make it a

29:59.332 --> 30:01.675
forever affair. You know, Vietnam, a 10,000-day 
war, the forever war. The first policy war we

30:08.882 --> 30:13.827
fought, our policy is contained communism. We've 
had it from Truman to Eisenhower, all of them. In

30:18.070 --> 30:21.974
Vietnam, we got ourselves caught in the swamp. We 
got bogged down and won. Could we have won if we'd

30:24.957 --> 30:28.882
applied enough men or enough technology at the 
right time? Sure. Did we have the resolve to win?

30:31.905 --> 30:32.065
No. I think the resolve went to the crew that won. Do 
you think that... the myths that led us there in the

30:41.549 --> 30:44.399
first place were valid? Or could we have even known 
if they weren't?
