00:01.313 --> 00:08.102
Dr. Bill Peters, who is the head of the Department 
of Education Curriculum and Instruction and has

00:01.313 --> 00:08.102
been at Texas A&M since 1981. And Dr. Peters, I hope 
you're going to share with me a few of the changes

00:08.202 --> 00:16.933
that have occurred since you have been here. And 
again, you are one of my newer interviewees. But

00:20.598 --> 00:27.287
maybe your perceptions of what has caused some of 
these major changes. you know, how you feel about

00:27.638 --> 00:29.801
where we're going. We'll go from the past to the 
present to the future, if that's okay. And just

00:34.348 --> 00:41.738
give me, first of all, changes within the college 
and then, or if you want to, specifically just

00:34.348 --> 00:41.738
within your department. As department head, 
you're seeing, you know, the department and the

00:43.060 --> 00:54.417
college from a totally different, because you 
have interaction with the dean and it's, you know,

00:43.060 --> 00:54.417
I'm kind of peeking in through little windows and 
doors. I don't I'm not a part of the whole system or

00:54.976 --> 01:01.002
the organization. Well, I came to Texas A&M 
University from the University of Kentucky,

01:01.022 --> 01:07.709
where I had chaired a similar department. And I was 
at that institution for 13 years. And I served

01:12.254 --> 01:15.478
under the leadership of George Denemark. And 
George Denemark was a very well-known leader in

01:16.459 --> 01:20.963
teacher education. And I felt very, very 
fortunate. to move from the leadership of George

01:24.794 --> 01:28.680
Gennemer to the leadership of Dean. How did Dean 
find you? Or was it Dean Corrigan? Yes, Dean

01:35.170 --> 01:35.871
Corrigan. This is rather an interesting story. 
And I guess I could share it as an anecdote,

01:40.358 --> 01:45.666
perhaps, as part of how this occurred. I was 
completing my first term at the University of

01:47.309 --> 01:52.557
Kentucky. And in October, as chair of the 
Department of Curriculum and Instruction at

01:53.617 --> 02:08.892
Kentucky, I received a notice, as I do from a number 
of institutions, that there was an opening for

01:53.617 --> 02:08.892
head of the Department of Curriculum and 
Instruction at Texas A&M University. And

02:09.894 --> 02:12.199
frankly, I was impressed just with the 
announcement itself. It was very well written. It

02:15.757 --> 02:17.600
had a statement about the community. It was on very 
fine paper. It was the type of thing that's

02:21.084 --> 02:28.154
different from the kind of announcement that 
normally passes over one's desk. And I guess I

02:29.616 --> 02:40.971
would say that I wasn't struck in terms of saying 
this is something I'm going to apply for, but I was

02:29.616 --> 02:40.971
rather struck by the advertisement and the fact 
that it was a Texas A&M University, but an

02:41.204 --> 02:45.730
institution about which I knew very little. And as 
I normally do, I listed it on our bulletin board and

02:47.252 --> 03:00.450
really gave not much further thought to it, except 
that it was the year that I was entering into my

02:47.252 --> 03:00.450
review. And now I'm, I guess I'm going to be getting 
a little bit into my personality now, but I guess I

03:07.546 --> 03:27.698
dismissed that announcement because what I did 
not want to have perceived was any kind of

03:07.546 --> 03:27.698
perception that I was thinking about going to 
another institution as a way to sort of get a more

03:07.546 --> 03:27.698
favorable review, shall we say. And I was very 
happy at Kentucky. I began my career there as an

03:30.334 --> 03:34.019
assistant professor and moved through the ranks. 
In three years, I was an associate professor, and

03:34.540 --> 03:39.387
then I became a full professor and so forth. And 
working under George Denimart's leadership, I

03:40.188 --> 03:43.814
was very, very happy. There were some rumors about 
George thinking about retiring. And I guess there

03:51.185 --> 03:57.634
were a couple of subconscious elements that were 
functioning within me that perhaps made me

03:57.850 --> 04:03.579
subconsciously think about a move, but not really 
thinking about one. Well, I just dismissed it from

04:05.062 --> 04:07.686
my mind, to be honest with you. In early spring, a 
second announcement from Texas A&M University

04:09.990 --> 04:20.787
crossed my desk because the search was reopened. 
And I thought, well, this is curious. Apparently,

04:25.380 --> 04:28.384
they have not found someone for that position. Who 
was department head then? Or was it an interim?

04:30.967 --> 04:33.089
David David was the interim department head. 
Robert Schutz had had a heart attack. And David

04:36.273 --> 04:41.659
David was serving as interim head.

04:41.679 --> 04:49.609
I mentioned at dinner one evening, my children, my 
son in particular, was still in high school. And I

04:50.370 --> 04:52.512
mentioned this at the dinner table. to my wife, I 
said, that's curious, I have another

04:53.588 --> 05:00.878
announcement that passed my desk about Texas A&M 
University, and no one really knew too much about

04:53.588 --> 05:00.878
the university. And my son said, Dad, you know, 
it's a warm climate, why don't you just go ahead and

05:01.639 --> 05:09.269
apply for that job and see what would happen? Now, 
at that time, I had, my review had been completed,

05:09.669 --> 05:23.528
and I had received a favorable review and was 
reappointed for another term as chair of the

05:09.669 --> 05:23.528
department. That, of course, took away any 
semblance of my attempt to use any leverage. I

05:31.604 --> 05:34.148
still said, well, you know, I'm still happy. We 
like Lexington. It's a pretty part of the country,

05:35.329 --> 05:37.412
and so forth. And I dismissed it again. My daughter 
was at the University of Virginia at that time. And

05:43.501 --> 05:53.937
I can't exactly remember the date, but it was about 
the first week in May, perhaps, when we needed to

05:43.501 --> 05:53.937
get a U-Haul. to go to the University of Virginia to 
pack up her things to bring her home for summer. The

05:59.403 --> 06:03.028
deadline for applying for this position was 
something like May 15. And this was either May 13 or

06:03.809 --> 06:06.633
May 14. And as we were packing to leave, my son said, 
dad, did you ever send that application in? And I

06:13.381 --> 06:17.026
said, no, I didn't. But I have it all done. But I 
said, I think the deadline is probably tomorrow or

06:19.448 --> 06:25.715
the next day, so, and we're busy, we're trying to 
move. And he said, look, why don't we nail it on the

06:25.795 --> 06:32.342
way leaving for picking up Vicki? And I did. And he 
said, it may be postmarked. And I said, because if

06:37.688 --> 06:40.612
it isn't postmarked by the deadline, it can't be 
considered. Well, we went on our journey to pick up

06:41.673 --> 06:46.418
my daughter from the University of Virginia, and 
Patrick came back. got back, I believe it was on

06:47.191 --> 06:59.207
Monday, and I was returning to U-Haul, and came 
back home, and my wife said, Bill, you have a call

06:47.191 --> 06:59.207
from Texas. And I said, oh, certainly I have a call 
from Texas. Well, it was Brian Cole. And Brian

07:06.377 --> 07:12.726
called to see if indeed I was sincere about my 
application. And I said, yes, I was sincere about

07:13.685 --> 07:17.569
my application. That's why I forwarded it. And he 
said, well, we would be interested in having you

07:19.811 --> 07:28.640
come to visit with us on campus. I was in the midst of 
recruiting for Kentucky at that time. And I also

07:33.565 --> 07:39.792
had some other rather vital things that I had to get 
done. So I explained to him that my the time I could

07:43.469 --> 07:55.521
come to be rather limited, but I could come, I 
couldn't arrive until like 11 o'clock on one

07:43.469 --> 07:55.521
evening because of the flight arrangements, and 
would be able to spend a day and a half or so, which

07:43.469 --> 07:55.521
was the time they wanted. In the meantime, I, of 
course, returned to my office, and I had a few

07:55.541 --> 08:04.570
faculty members who came in to see me and said, Bill 
Peters, what are you about? And I said, what do you

08:05.271 --> 08:07.413
mean? Well, obviously, there had been some 
telephone calls made from this institution to my,

08:10.570 --> 08:16.777
at that time, home institution. And I said, well, 
I'm just really going down to look. And I had

08:19.720 --> 08:28.410
previous to this mentioned to Dean Denimer that I 
had received this second notice, and I said I might

08:19.720 --> 08:28.410
apply. And his comment to me was, Bill, you can go 
and look, but don't you dare leave, which I felt

08:29.091 --> 08:36.019
very good about. Of course, I had just had 
favorable review and so forth. Well, I came down,

08:38.887 --> 08:44.115
and everything just happened very rapidly. And I 
accepted the position here. I could tell you

08:48.342 --> 08:51.848
another little story, and I don't know if it should 
go on tape or not. But I came down here for an

08:51.868 --> 08:54.031
interview. And at that time, they were also 
interviewing for reading positions. And Dr. Pat

09:00.421 --> 09:04.067
Alexander was being interviewed here. And at 
breakfast on the day I was being interviewed, she

09:05.009 --> 09:10.516
was also at breakfast at another table. And I think 
it may be David David who wanted to introduce me to

09:11.397 --> 09:16.123
her. And of course, what David David did not know at 
that time was that I was flying back to Kentucky and

09:17.785 --> 09:34.105
would be picking up Pat at the airport in Lexington 
because she was being interviewed for our reading

09:17.785 --> 09:34.105
position at that institution. Isn't that funny? 
And that's exactly what occurred. I interviewed

09:38.363 --> 09:46.933
her and told her she must remember I'm 
interviewing for the University of Kentucky. And

09:46.953 --> 09:48.255
we both ended up here. Isn't that interesting? 
Well, you have, is it the largest department in the

09:50.197 --> 09:53.982
university? Yes, one of the largest. How many in 
your staff? How many in the staff? I mean, how many,

09:57.986 --> 10:00.109
like, people? over 2,000 students in the 
department. And if you include those individuals

10:04.615 --> 10:12.083
who are interested in certification outside of 
the college, we run about 2,400 students. And our

10:13.785 --> 10:20.112
faculty and staff total about 100 in the 
department. So in fact, our department is really

10:20.132 --> 10:25.618
larger than some colleges of education. 
University of Oklahoma, for example, has

10:25.638 --> 10:30.163
something like 38 full-time tenure track back. So 
really, by the time you came here, a lot of the major

10:32.350 --> 10:36.877
things had already occurred. Of course, they had 
already made the transition to the new

10:36.917 --> 10:39.901
administration. Yes, first year. So you have not 
experienced any of the drastic, you are now

10:41.724 --> 10:49.936
probably in the most, in the biggest upheaval type 
changes, would you say? Yes, I guess I would. Let me

10:52.620 --> 10:56.466
say that when I came here, the department probably 
was half the size it is now. I think we had about

10:56.506 --> 10:59.931
eleven or twelve hundred students. So what has 
happened since I've been here is an enormous

11:01.058 --> 11:10.592
increase in student enrollment in our 
department. And what is that based on, or what is

11:10.732 --> 11:13.516
that attributed to? Well, it's attributed to a 
number of things. First, I think it's attributed

11:17.401 --> 11:21.207
to the quality of our teacher preparation 
program. Second, I think it's attributed to the

11:23.630 --> 11:27.015
quality of the student population at Texas A&M 
University.

11:34.157 --> 11:41.449
Third, I think it's attributed to our growing 
national reputation.

11:41.469 --> 11:44.874
Tell me how we have gotten that growing national 
reputation. What has really been the primary...

11:51.110 --> 11:56.938
First is the fact that we have a man like Dean 
Corrigan as dean of this college. And he has been a

11:58.140 --> 12:05.390
respected educator prior to coming to Texas A&M 
University. However, he has increased, I think,

12:05.450 --> 12:20.712
his visibility nationally and internationally 
because of his sincere professional interest in

12:05.450 --> 12:20.712
education.

12:23.037 --> 12:36.735
To put it another way,

12:23.037 --> 12:36.735
Kim Corrigan is not the kind of individual who is 
doing something to gain more stature for himself.

12:38.397 --> 12:46.147
He does it out of the sincere interest for those who 
are going to benefit by what he thinks he can

12:38.397 --> 12:46.147
achieve. I think that makes quite a difference 
because what he has to say is perceived as being

12:52.130 --> 13:02.386
said to further and to make better the lives of our 
young people. As opposed to furthering, he's

13:04.689 --> 13:07.173
putting it better in his hand. He'd use a 
colloquialism.

13:14.825 --> 13:16.247
I think that the And this may get into some of the 
other points that you might be raising a little

13:17.543 --> 13:22.208
later on. Well, that's OK. They can be in it. Sure, 
sure. No problem. Is the fact that what I'm very

13:24.691 --> 13:39.429
pleased about in regard to our department is the 
department's growing national reputation.

13:39.449 --> 13:40.750
And I think that is due. Now, some people would look 
upon this negatively as opposed to positively. I

13:46.703 --> 13:52.071
need to share with you that my entire career has 
been spent in major research institutions. And so

13:52.531 --> 13:54.133
I come from that mentality. And I think you need to 
have that context. So that when I came to Texas A&M

13:57.478 --> 14:12.279
University, I came from that mentality, which 
said that there is not a dichotomy between

13:57.478 --> 14:12.279
outstanding teaching and outstanding research. 
Because in teacher education, I don't see how you

14:15.492 --> 14:23.900
can be on the cutting edge of teacher education 
unless you're on the cutting edge of research, and

14:15.492 --> 14:23.900
they support one another. They are not 
contradictory. I think some of our best

14:27.263 --> 14:39.353
instructors, and I could name a few if you wanted me 
to, but as illustrative of this, I think some of our

14:27.263 --> 14:39.353
best instructors are the best researchers. They 
go hand in hand.

14:44.062 --> 14:46.965
We were just talking earlier about Pat Alexander. 
That's an interesting point. Pat Alexander now

14:49.687 --> 14:54.471
has a Spencer Fellowship. And that is highly 
competitive, and it's given by the National

14:54.491 --> 15:01.857
Academy of Education at Harvard University. She 
has a $25,000 grant. And the manner in which you get

15:04.900 --> 15:13.107
that grant is by submitting a research proposal. 
And it is reviewed by the National Academy. And you

15:18.479 --> 15:29.751
gain that grant if they feel that your research is 
going to truly make an impact on the field of

15:18.479 --> 15:29.751
education. What is she researching? What is her 
area? She's looking at domain-specific

15:31.392 --> 15:39.841
cognition versus the subject-specific matter. 
Ooh.

15:44.339 --> 15:46.823
It's really metacognition is what she's getting 
into. Okay. Metacognition. Now, you probably are

15:48.005 --> 16:03.469
aware of the fact that she just was one of the 
university-level recipients of the Outstanding

15:48.005 --> 16:03.469
Teaching Award by the Association of Former 
Students. Oh, yes, very definitely. That was

16:04.110 --> 16:06.294
wonderful. So what I'm saying, I think, It's 
illustrated by Pat. She is an outstanding teacher

16:10.390 --> 16:15.636
and an outstanding researcher. Another 
individual in our department, just not to be

16:15.656 --> 16:21.584
sexist, John Denton. And John Denton is a very 
demanding, as Pat is a very demanding instructor,

16:22.405 --> 16:36.182
but a highly respected, sought-after instructor 
who also is highly productive in research. The

16:37.917 --> 16:45.865
point I'm making is that...

16:45.885 --> 16:46.686
I know what you're... This is going to be on tape, 
but I'm going to say it anyway.

16:52.732 --> 16:53.833
I came here in August.

16:56.636 --> 17:04.644
I already had to begin the promotion and tenure 
review process in the department.

17:04.664 --> 17:06.085
I brought with me a certain mentality of promotion 
and tenure. And what I brought with me was the fact

17:12.363 --> 17:23.417
that when one was going to be promoted and tenured, 
what you did was to put together a dossier. And in

17:25.119 --> 17:33.709
your dossier were examples of supporting your 
teaching activities, your service activities,

17:25.119 --> 17:33.709
and your research activities. You also included 
reprints of your publications. In addition, the

17:38.781 --> 17:54.859
department head sought letters of reference from 
individuals who were respected in the nation and

17:38.781 --> 17:54.859
outside the institution. So there were a few 
people. Letters of reference? Letters of

17:58.363 --> 18:00.405
reference for support. of promotion and tenure of 
individuals. Based on these dossiers? Well,

18:05.135 --> 18:06.277
based on a vitae. A vitae, OK. All right, all right. 
You can't send the whole dossier. Right. Now, that

18:09.682 --> 18:23.683
meant when I came here, when I had these names of 
these individuals about whom I knew very little

18:09.682 --> 18:23.683
because I was in the institution, I simply met with 
them and shared, you know, now you'll get your

18:09.682 --> 18:23.683
dossier together. And if you want to give me a 
couple names of people you know, but I'm going to

18:23.723 --> 18:30.713
select some individuals in the nation who are in 
your field. secure letters of reference. Of

18:33.112 --> 18:37.158
course, they sat there just as you are, smiling. 
And of course, from my perception, I just assumed

18:37.658 --> 18:43.446
that this was routine, when in fact it wasn't. It 
had not been routine, which I guess would begin to

18:43.767 --> 18:56.364
show a change that was occurring in the 
institution, a part of which I was. I was part of

18:56.544 --> 18:58.106
that change. But it was strictly departmental, 
not At that point, it was departmental. And I

19:05.921 --> 19:08.104
didn't realize that. So when I sent out my letters 
of reference and they came back and so forth, when I

19:08.124 --> 19:18.218
put together my letter from the department in 
supporting it, I indicated these letters of

19:08.124 --> 19:18.218
reference. Well, now at that time, all we had to do 
was forward this letter from the department in

19:18.238 --> 19:29.995
which we supported or did not support the 
recommendation for promotion and or tenure. And I

19:30.616 --> 19:34.641
went to the college and then went forward from the 
college. No materials were required at that time

19:36.523 --> 19:46.136
other than this letter, although I did support it 
with these letters of reference. I don't know if

19:46.156 --> 19:55.307
you are aware of the procedures we now follow, but 
the procedures that we began to use in the

19:46.156 --> 19:55.307
department are very similar to the promotion and 
tenure procedures that now have been instituted

19:55.507 --> 20:07.264
by the central administration so that all faculty 
who are up for promotion and tenure must have a

19:55.507 --> 20:07.264
dossier. It's not called for by the central 
administration, but it's there, and it includes

20:08.085 --> 20:14.635
many of the pieces of material that I just cited. 
And that dossier is reviewed by the promotion and

20:14.755 --> 20:19.342
tenure committee as well as by the department 
head. It requires a minimum of three letters

20:20.343 --> 20:23.488
outside at the university. And those three 
letters must be from individuals who are at least

20:26.063 --> 20:32.950
at the rank to which the person wants to be 
promoted.

20:34.051 --> 20:39.096
So that, I guess what I'm saying is that have I seen 
change at this institution? I have seen a great

20:39.116 --> 20:49.327
deal of change at this institution in regard to 
where it has moved in terms of faculty review for

20:39.116 --> 20:49.327
promotion and tenure. So then we could answer, 
that would be an answer possibly to one of of your

20:53.033 --> 20:58.000
contributions in number nine, because you 
already came with that idea, and it sort of

20:53.033 --> 20:58.000
evolved. Perhaps it had something to do with the 
way it is now structured. I don't want to be so bold

21:03.288 --> 21:18.670
as to say it was a contribution, but let me say that 
one of the first things we did, which I'd be glad to

21:03.288 --> 21:18.670
provide you if you'd like, is to put together an 
annual evaluation document And that came out in

21:19.038 --> 21:21.021
February of 82. Remember, I came here in August. 
And in March of 82, we put a promotion and tenure

21:23.745 --> 21:26.910
document together. Because one of the things that 
I recognized when I came here is that there was

21:28.773 --> 21:32.839
nothing in it. This is for the whole college, not 
for them. You're still talking department. OK,

21:36.604 --> 21:37.165
I'm sorry. You want me to talk to partners? Yes, but 
I mean, I wondered how it might have influenced,

21:38.966 --> 21:48.597
because again, I'm looking at the department and 
how the external environment of the college and

21:38.966 --> 21:48.597
then the external environment of the university. 
So maybe how, if there's anything that fits all.

21:54.343 --> 22:06.797
Since there was very little in writing, and one of 
the things that I felt very strongly about is that

21:54.343 --> 22:06.797
faculty, I believe we have to have expectations, 
and those expectations need to be But at the same

22:07.402 --> 22:14.198
time, it's clear that faculty have known what 
those expectations are. Now, then it's a question

22:14.218 --> 22:19.611
of knowing those expectations, have you met them? 
And there was a faculty committee, a faculty

22:19.631 --> 22:24.803
evaluation committee, that put together these 
documents. I served as an ad hoc member of the

22:28.930 --> 22:31.934
committee. But it is a faculty committee 
document, both of those. And if you'd like copies

22:36.420 --> 22:38.363
of those, I'd share them. I would, surely. And in 
the sense of what you're saying, in retrospect, I

22:39.645 --> 22:46.414
guess perhaps they were one of the earliest 
documents in the college. Because Ernie Goetz and

22:47.155 --> 22:56.207
the faculty advisory council about a year ago 
began to interview department heads in regard to

22:56.879 --> 23:00.743
what criteria do they have? Were they written 
down? And this is all an outgrowth, I think, of the

23:02.305 --> 23:07.691
Faculty Senate, which was formulated. And our 
documents, as I indicated, were dated 1982. And I

23:10.575 --> 23:15.240
think they're probably the earlier documents in 
the count. And other departments have formulated

23:16.121 --> 23:18.985
their documents. And does there continue, then, 
to be total autonomy in that every department,

23:19.045 --> 23:24.591
according to the department heads, criteria just 
follows? In other words, everybody's doing their

23:26.547 --> 23:32.456
own thing as far as this type of document? Within 
the general guidelines of the college. See,

23:35.802 --> 23:37.003
that's part of what has occurred. What the Parent 
and Staff Advisory Council is trying to do and has

23:37.184 --> 23:45.837
tried to do is to find out what each department is 
doing. And if there are discrepancies, then they

23:45.857 --> 23:53.869
want to be able to identify those so that there can 
be a college review committee that will

23:54.406 --> 23:58.913
understand where each of the departments is 
coming from. So you really answered that question

23:58.933 --> 24:17.143
that I had about teaching research and service, 
you know, through what you just shared, because

23:58.933 --> 24:17.143
that is the way, in your perception, and most 
everybody else is feeling that, you know, there's

23:58.933 --> 24:17.143
pressure to do research, but if you're doing 
research, you know, you can't do justice to

23:58.933 --> 24:17.143
teaching and vice versa. Absolutely. Now, it's 
possible for a faculty member to have a modified

24:22.199 --> 24:24.442
role responsibility.

24:26.385 --> 24:44.031
In other words, in our document, when you review 
our document, you'll see that a faculty member

24:26.385 --> 24:44.031
could come in to talk to me and say, Bill, I really 
need to do a lot of research in the coming year.

24:45.092 --> 24:49.759
Could you reduce my instructional load by one 
course? if we can see that we can cover our

24:49.958 --> 24:52.101
staffing. And I'd say, yes, we can do that. Then the 
role responsibility has shifted. And then your

24:58.371 --> 25:04.259
evaluation at the end of the year would be based on 
that modification of role. Now, if you were, let's

25:05.221 --> 25:17.299
say you were a new assistant professor coming in to 
me, and you said to me, you wanted to, if it's

25:05.221 --> 25:17.299
possible, you'd like to really, you enjoy 
teaching so much, you'd like to do teaching and

25:05.221 --> 25:17.299
have your research component practically just 
10%. But I would say to you is, well, let's think

25:22.747 --> 25:26.413
that one over. Let's talk in terms of your 
probationary period and what the expectations

25:26.433 --> 25:30.680
might be. Now, do you think it would be wise, if we 
went this route, do you think it would be wise for

25:30.700 --> 25:36.129
you to do that at this point? What would be the 
impact of that next year and the year after?

25:39.634 --> 25:44.502
Because, from my point of view, it would be a 
disservice to the individual Now,

25:45.072 --> 25:58.813
because your department has grown so 
tremendously, do you teach classes all the time?

25:58.833 --> 25:59.734
So you always have taught? Always have. Okay. How 
has it affected not only your work with students,

26:02.438 --> 26:12.193
but do you get a feedback from your faculty as to 
whether or not they're able? making great

26:12.494 --> 26:18.682
numbers, or it's impeding their work with 
students and giving them the attention. And do you

26:18.702 --> 26:25.511
have a limit, for example, on how many committees 
people can chair, or how many graduate students

26:18.702 --> 26:25.511
they can advise in that kind of thing? Yes. We 
instituted, through our graduate faculty, a set

26:26.893 --> 26:40.071
of criteria in terms of the number of chairs that 
you could have in regard to PhD, DD, the number So we

26:40.456 --> 26:46.224
have put a limitation on that because that was 
getting out of hand also. Let me share with you that

26:46.344 --> 27:02.205
my role has

26:46.344 --> 27:02.205
been tremendously pushed into a management role. 
With the increases that we have had and the limited

27:02.705 --> 27:08.573
resources, frankly, that we've received It has 
been, my time has to be spent almost entirely in

27:10.122 --> 27:16.391
managing resources. And frankly, I'm very 
pleased with the manner in which we have been able

27:17.373 --> 27:29.471
to function within this stroke pattern.

27:29.491 --> 27:32.997
By managing resources, are you talking about 
space and money, just everything? I'm talking

27:33.077 --> 27:34.659
about staffing. I'm talking about space. I'm 
talking about operating expenses, I'm talking

27:36.818 --> 27:42.826
about travel, I'm talking about research. The

27:45.089 --> 27:52.899
October 1986 issue of Teacher Education, you're 
probably aware of this article. Productivity of

27:52.919 --> 27:56.864
faculty in higher education institutions.

28:00.108 --> 28:03.653
This is based on the number of articles produced, 
now this is in teacher education, produced in

28:04.814 --> 28:10.360
major teacher education journals. And number of 
presentations made at teacher education

28:11.461 --> 28:27.419
organizations like the Association of Teacher 
Educations, the American Association of

28:11.461 --> 28:27.419
Colleges for Teacher Education, the American 
Educational Research Association. If you want to

28:27.439 --> 28:30.402
look, look at where Texas A&M ranks. And what I'm 
pleased with is that although obviously this

28:34.919 --> 28:51.206
means a survey of all the college faculty, in 
regard to teacher education, my faculty is

28:34.919 --> 28:51.206
heavily involved in teacher education, as 
opposed to...

28:56.474 --> 28:57.636
I'm trying to think of an area. industrial 
education or something like that. So that when it

29:01.316 --> 29:17.674
comes to making presentations about how are you 
preparing teachers, what are the best

29:01.316 --> 29:17.674
strategies, instructional strategies, and so 
forth, and research in those domains, I would say

29:01.316 --> 29:17.674
that our faculty are in a large bulk of this group. I 
think that's incredible. And now, is there much,

29:19.837 --> 29:26.104
in your faculty, much collaboration with people 
in other departments or within The department

29:26.354 --> 29:28.897
with each other, there is? As much as you'd like, or 
is there ever as much? Part of this is coming from

29:34.703 --> 29:41.250
Dean's initial structure of the college in regard 
to its inquiry groups. And I think you're aware of

29:41.270 --> 29:44.413
the inquiry groups. And so I think one of the things 
Dean has tried to do is to cut down the departmental

29:44.433 --> 29:55.905
barriers to the degree possible. When I first came 
here,

29:56.982 --> 30:07.012
it was clear to me that we were highly 
departmentalized. To put it another way, the

30:07.773 --> 30:15.020
faculty was very much oriented toward its own 
department. And I think there's been quite a

30:15.040 --> 30:18.223
change in that regard. As department, obviously, 
I have to try to get the greatest resources I can for

30:19.324 --> 30:26.331
my department. had to struggle over these years 
because of this enormous growth that we've

30:26.665 --> 30:30.590
experienced. And I feel that Dean has been open to 
all departments in regard to their needs. And

30:38.679 --> 30:41.663
obviously, we all feel like we could get a little 
bit more. But I think in terms of what we've gotten,

30:41.803 --> 30:53.297
and some of this has been central administration, 
like operating expenses, we simply haven't

30:41.803 --> 30:53.297
received increases in operating expenses. And 
that's something the central administration

30:53.918 --> 30:56.782
basically deals with. So that's not something 
that is unfair in the college, if you understand

30:57.282 --> 31:03.510
what I'm saying. And that's why I feel very 
strongly that we've done very well in managing

31:03.530 --> 31:12.141
when we can have this kind of research 
productivity. At the same time, we are still

31:12.842 --> 31:16.827
serving our students. Now, that's becoming more 
and more a problem. We just began

31:20.446 --> 31:24.834
pre-registration, and I already have a number of 
classes that are closed. Now, I have students sign

31:26.898 --> 31:37.378
a little slip in the outer office and what class 
they want and why they need it. Here I have an

31:37.398 --> 31:41.506
example of one of the burdens of management that I 
have had to assume. We do not...
