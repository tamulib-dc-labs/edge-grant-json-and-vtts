One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. One, 
two, three. Say something. Testing. Testing.

00:15.649 --> 00:17.652
This is Monday, the 28th of August. Sitting in a 
nice, quiet living room at Jim Ray's house,

00:18.212 --> 00:31.827
getting ready to chat with him about his 
experiences here, being the man in charge of all of

00:18.212 --> 00:31.827
the scenery. Let's see, now I should say Gene and 
not Eugene. That's fine, either way. But most

00:38.920 --> 00:40.001
people call you Gene? Most people call me Gene, 
yes. To introduce yourself to anyone who may

00:41.983 --> 00:51.533
listen to this tape or read a transcription that 
didn't know you, describe your background before

00:41.983 --> 00:51.533
you got to A&M. Where'd you grow up, what'd your 
family do, went to high school, college, where'd

00:51.553 --> 00:59.721
you work and all in the service before you got here? 
I was born east of Abilene, Texas, between Abilene

01:00.325 --> 01:10.064
and Albany, and my father was a farmer. My mother 
taught school at a little two-room school at

01:10.284 --> 01:19.161
Hamby, Texas.

01:20.575 --> 01:27.666
When I was, after school when I was nine, we moved to 
Leveland, Texas. My dad bought a hatchery and feed

01:27.906 --> 01:47.055
store there and we moved out to the flatlands and 
graduated from Leveland High School in 1955 and

01:27.906 --> 01:47.055
went to Texas Tech and

01:49.769 --> 02:09.634
majored in horticulture and park administration 
and

01:49.769 --> 02:09.634
graduated in 1960

01:49.769 --> 02:09.634
and came back to Level End in a small business.

02:11.588 --> 02:27.994
and was in that for, it was a small nursery and 
greenhouse operation until 1963 and decided that

02:11.588 --> 02:27.994
the town was too small and people didn't, 
understand that I was grown and I had some

02:29.408 --> 02:36.757
information and that my services weren't free. 
And so we moved to Oklahoma City and I went to work

02:38.118 --> 02:48.410
for Higdon's nursery and greenhouse operation. I 
was managing some greenhouses, about an acre of

02:48.430 --> 02:55.939
greenhouses, and did a little landscape design 
work. That's when I renewed my acquaintance with

02:55.919 --> 03:00.583
Bob Rucker. Bob came in, he was back, Bob was my 
landscape design prof at Tech and had gone back to

03:01.484 --> 03:16.959
the University of Oklahoma and I guess it was maybe 
the fall of 1959, somewhere along in there. And he

03:18.340 --> 03:23.665
was at Tech about three years and at any rate, he 
came in the governor, Henry Bellman, had asked him

03:23.645 --> 03:40.266
to more or less be in charge of the work Oklahoma 
exhibited at the New York World's Fair, which was

03:23.645 --> 03:40.266
depicting the green area of Oklahoma, the water 
and everything like this. He came in hunting

03:40.346 --> 03:43.690
redbud trees, state tree of Oklahoma. And we 
hadn't seen each other in a number of years. And so,

03:46.414 --> 03:51.340
you know, I knew he was down there and things, this 
was long in the fall of 1963 and long in the spring,

03:52.602 --> 04:05.768
he came back in and that was an early summer 
actually because that had taken him away from his

04:06.963 --> 04:23.537
job at OU and he said how would you like to leave this 
place and I said fine because at that point in time

04:06.963 --> 04:23.537
my 45 hour a week job had gone to seven days a week 
candle can't and it was a lot of long hours, and I

04:25.373 --> 04:28.018
said fine, where's the door? And so that's how I got 
into the campus grounds, landscape grounds

04:28.518 --> 04:35.590
business. And I went down as Bob's assistant 
supervisor in the summer of 1964. and I've often

04:44.476 --> 05:08.340
kind of kiddingly said that it was the New York 
World's Fair that got me into this and which it

04:44.476 --> 05:08.340
actually was I guess but and I stayed at Oklahoma 
until Bob came down here in 1968 and I took his job

04:44.476 --> 05:08.340
and then Stayed there until

05:09.603 --> 05:22.836
early 1973, and then came to work down here on March 
1, 1973. Summarize briefly your

05:23.339 --> 05:26.524
responsibilities at OU. My responsibility at OU 
was basically what they were here. I was in charge

05:30.870 --> 05:52.080
of all the landscaping grounds, a few other 
things, but primarily all the grounds,

05:30.870 --> 05:52.080
everything outside basically, and the routine 
maintenance, the design and implementation of

05:30.870 --> 05:52.080
new landscapes around buildings, and this type of 
thing. describe the process here. How did they

05:55.620 --> 05:57.943
contact you, or you them? How did the employment 
come about? Well, I had

06:01.287 --> 06:07.234
got a call. Well, when Bob came down here in 1968, he 
came down here to a garden club. He was very

06:14.263 --> 06:17.728
involved in national garden clubs. And he came 
back and said, would you like to go to A&M? in 1968

06:22.013 --> 06:46.317
and I said no I'm happy here you know and when he had 
mentioned that when in fact I think they were

06:22.013 --> 06:46.317
really after him which that in fact came about but 
then in in I guess in December

06:22.013 --> 06:46.317
yeah it must have been in December of of uh 73 yeah 72 
ray smith who was director of personnel at that

06:47.765 --> 07:05.706
point in time called me and asked me if i would be 
interested in coming down to interview and i said

06:47.765 --> 07:05.706
yeah i might you know uh And although I was quite 
happy at OU, it had been very lean on salary

07:07.087 --> 07:22.857
increases and all, and so I decided it might be a 
good thing I could come down and visit Rucker and

07:07.087 --> 07:22.857
all like that. So he said, well, you can come down 
during Christmas break. And I said, what

07:26.624 --> 07:28.487
Christmas break? I said, we get Christmas Eve 
afternoon and Christmas. But anyway, I had plenty

07:36.013 --> 07:44.772
of vacation time, so I came down and interviewed 
and visited with them. Bob and he carried me around

07:44.752 --> 08:09.549
and then took me up to meet Tom Cherry who was his 
boss and ultimately my boss and we became, we had a

07:44.752 --> 08:09.549
very good connection at that point in time and 
ultimately had a very good working relationship

07:44.752 --> 08:09.549
but I'm very fond of both Bob Rucker and Tom Cherry. 
As far as you then indicate they contacted you you

08:14.637 --> 08:38.248
didn't yes no i didn't apply do you have any idea 
whether you were the only person they were i have no

08:14.637 --> 08:38.248
idea never asked who uh who who was involved in the 
interview visit who'd you meet um basically bob

08:14.637 --> 08:38.248
rucker and tom cherry uh did they sit down together 
and they talked to you separately uh separately

08:14.637 --> 08:38.248
and then together um I came and visited with Bob, 
and he took me around campus and then up to the Koch

08:39.089 --> 08:46.778
building in Tom's office. And we sat down and 
probably visited for about an hour. And finally,

08:50.722 --> 08:58.310
Mr. Cherry said, what makes you think you can come 
down here and handle this? And I said, well, it

08:58.350 --> 09:04.477
might be we could both learn something, you know, 
because me being from Texas Tech and all. And we got

09:04.778 --> 09:08.742
along great. did did they give you a comparatively 
clear understanding of what they were looking for

09:09.532 --> 09:37.783
what what did they want done they they wanted 
someone basically to assist bob and i came as

09:09.532 --> 09:37.783
assistant landscape architect and in charge of 
basically all the all the maintenance operations

09:09.532 --> 09:37.783
and i had some input into the design and at that 
point in time we were just formulating

09:41.898 --> 10:00.194
I would guess I would call it a site development 
aspect where as a project, let's say a major

09:41.898 --> 10:00.194
building project went through facilities 
planning and construction, there would be a

09:41.898 --> 10:00.194
certain amount of money that was set aside for site 
work, landscape and irrigation. And at that point

10:00.375 --> 10:08.722
in time we decided that if we were going to have a 
viable landscape, we had to irrigate it. So

10:08.742 --> 10:11.905
therefore the two went hand in glove. because if if 
uh if we were going to have something green we had to

10:11.885 --> 10:40.626
water it and that started we had a few irrigation 
systems on campus but that really started the

10:11.885 --> 10:40.626
growth of all of our landscape irrigation systems 
simply because there are times like this summer

10:11.885 --> 10:40.626
that if you don't water it you're not going to have 
it do you remember asking them any questions that

10:41.770 --> 10:46.166
where you got an answer that was disappointing to 
you? No, really.

10:50.410 --> 10:56.899
We talked about a number of things, how it would 
work. One of the things that, and I'll be real

10:57.540 --> 11:09.377
frank, what appealed to me was that the grounds 
area was in the final stage of separation from the

10:57.540 --> 11:09.377
physical plant. At OU, I had worked under the 
director of physical plant, which it will work

11:16.178 --> 11:43.789
both ways there are times when it works better and 
this basically allowed direct access to the

11:16.178 --> 11:43.789
administration without having to go through a 
director of physical plant who is normally an

11:16.178 --> 11:43.789
engineer there's nothing wrong with engineers 
but they're interested in buildings and

11:16.178 --> 11:43.789
structures and and utilities and things like this 
and they're not too keen on the green things and the

11:44.427 --> 11:52.556
aesthetic part of a campus. That's what I've 
generally found. Did they give you a

11:55.339 --> 12:07.532
comparatively clear definition of what your 
responsibility is going to be relative to working

11:55.339 --> 12:07.532
with Bob Rucker? not really they basically they 
said that I would be his assistant and that you see

12:08.288 --> 12:36.507
it at that time Bob I believe was also head of he was 
director of grounds landscape architect and head

12:08.288 --> 12:36.507
of horticulture floriculture the academic side 
and which that that was a pretty good load and so

12:08.288 --> 12:36.507
basically they wanted me to to handle the 
maintenance end of it and the implementation part

12:37.567 --> 12:48.602
as we got into some new buildings and site work, 
this kind of thing. What promises did they make or

12:49.183 --> 12:54.330
what commitments did they make? Nothing other 
than

12:54.350 --> 13:04.664
I would be making about a third to 50% more than what 
I was making at OU. All right, now that's out. This

13:06.068 --> 13:07.650
is the only money question I'm going to ask. What 
was the beginning salary? I came here at $15,000 a

13:09.192 --> 13:11.435
year. I was making $10,000 at OU. And this is 1973? 
1973.

13:19.486 --> 13:19.947
Let's see. In these conversations, interviews or 
just plain conversations, the fact that you had

13:19.967 --> 13:32.403
gone to Tech, did that appear to be an advantage or a 
disadvantage? No. It was a... It was a point of

13:36.393 --> 13:43.484
discussion a little bit between Mr. Cherry and 
myself. He was kidding me quite a bit, you know,

13:44.365 --> 13:53.819
about a little bit, and it was all, I enjoyed that 
part of it. That was great. Was he an A&M

13:55.061 --> 13:59.147
undergraduate?

13:59.167 --> 14:03.514
I don't remember where he went to school, but I 
never thought of him as an

14:06.683 --> 14:11.409
You know, I think he went to Sam. I believe you're 
right. I'm almost positive he did. But, no, he and I

14:15.795 --> 14:29.153
just, I don't know, we, you know, you get, and I 
think we both got the feeling, you know, we just

14:15.795 --> 14:29.153
both hit it off very nicely. Describe the move down 
here. Well, I... The family and the meetings and

14:35.181 --> 14:36.623
everything. I

14:37.193 --> 14:45.465
left, it was on Friday, Friday evening, it was like 
3rd of January, something like this. But I

14:49.819 --> 14:52.322
remember it was on a Friday because I'd come down on 
Thursday. And so I had called my wife and told her

14:53.743 --> 15:06.216
that it was very interesting and we had some 
talking to do, you know, when I got back. And there

15:07.677 --> 15:12.422
was a major cold spell coming down. And I got iced in 
at Fort Worth going back. And something told me I

15:17.255 --> 15:22.967
better get up the next morning and try to get home. 
And it took me eight hours to drive from Fort Worth

15:23.989 --> 15:28.740
to Norman. And the further I got, the more snow. I 
mean, there were cars off the road, you know, and it

15:31.866 --> 15:34.993
was, Oh, 20, 25 miles an hour, maybe. And I got home, 
and we had like 15 inches of snow on the ground. But

15:43.223 --> 15:44.965
anyway, we sat down and talked about it. And of 
course, we have three children. We have the

15:48.369 --> 15:51.713
oldest, Randy. He was in eighth grade. Melissa was 
in probably the fifth grade. And Doug was

15:57.519 --> 16:05.368
probably second grade, maybe. And so we decided, 
okay, this is too good an opportunity to pass up. So

16:13.944 --> 16:19.560
we talked to the kids and Randy says, bye, I'm 
staying here. You know, I like it here. I don't want

16:22.484 --> 16:23.305
to move. So we decided that maybe we could afford a 
four bedroom house. And at that point in time, he

16:31.517 --> 16:39.068
and Douglas would not have to share a room because 
it was like the odd couple, basically. because

16:40.010 --> 16:49.369
Randy is always neat and exact, I mean, everything 
in its place, and Douglas is, you know, the floor is

16:40.010 --> 16:49.369
a storage facility, that kind of thing. And so that 
kind of changed his mind a little bit. So anyway, we

16:54.059 --> 16:58.288
came down and I called Bob and told him that I would 
accept the job. And so then we made a couple of

17:03.948 --> 17:09.974
trips, three trips down, house hunting and all 
that, put our house on the market. And there were

17:12.436 --> 17:21.626
only three or four four-bedroom houses in Bryan 
and College Station for sale. This happened to be

17:22.547 --> 17:23.668
one of them. Was this a new house? No, this was about 
18 months old, and the folks, the family were

17:27.284 --> 17:45.201
military, and he'd come back to school for a little 
bit and was leaving, and we looked at it, and Janet

17:27.284 --> 17:45.201
didn't like the kitchen, and then we looked and 
looked and looked, and finally came back to that

17:46.227 --> 18:07.948
that it was a very small kitchen and but we decided 
we wouldn't handle it and so we

17:46.227 --> 18:07.948
I guess our house sold probably two days before we 
moved you know and I'd gotten calls from one or two

18:08.975 --> 18:32.113
of the banks said you know if you need if you need a 
loan before you sell your house not a problem you

18:08.975 --> 18:32.113
know and it was a very um

18:08.975 --> 18:32.113
very warm type reception and all and so we moved and 
uh down here the last couple of days of february and

18:08.975 --> 18:32.113
uh and i went to work first march describe getting 
settled in first of all in the community the

18:32.465 --> 19:01.307
schools the community the neighbors what was it 
like for a newcomer to College Station it wasn't

18:32.465 --> 19:01.307
very bad the

18:32.465 --> 19:01.307
Janet joined the newcomers group and of course the 
kids moved and and they got right in school and they

18:32.465 --> 19:01.307
didn't have they didn't have a problem blending 
in. Of course, Randy was right close to the high

19:03.189 --> 19:17.036
school, and Melissa was going, I think she 
finished up at South Knoll, and Doug was going to

19:03.189 --> 19:17.036
South Knoll, and then the next year she went to, I 
guess, the middle school then. On that point, did

19:17.897 --> 19:25.692
you have any impression of the quality of the 
Indian Missile Aid schools with the Norman

19:17.897 --> 19:25.692
schools at that time? Um fairly similar the 
particularly the two the two younger ones had the

19:26.195 --> 19:54.767
grade school they were in was the open open 
classroom concept and that that was the primary

19:26.195 --> 19:54.767
difference I think it's just that they were used to 
that rather than you know very well delineated

19:26.195 --> 19:54.767
classrooms but really didn't didn't have any in 
terms of quality I don't know that we had any

19:54.967 --> 20:01.074
quality differential there at all. We had good 
schools in Norman, and kids seemed to,

20:01.094 --> 20:09.604
they didn't have to do any catch-up at all. If 
anything, they might have been a little bit ahead

20:10.445 --> 20:12.547
in places. All right, now describe getting 
settled in on the campus. Okay. Where were you

20:20.016 --> 20:23.640
quartered, and who, staff did you work with, and so 
forth? We had at that point in time only a couple of

20:23.705 --> 20:53.577
supervisory staff, and we were headquartered at 
what was then the grounds maintenance quarters on

20:23.705 --> 20:53.577
Old College at Hensel Park, a couple of quonset 
huts that were quite old, and had probably about 50

20:23.705 --> 20:53.577
workers. had a couple of supervisory staff, and I 
never will forget, of course, College Avenue was,

20:54.417 --> 21:02.768
as it is now, is busy thoroughfare. And we, I found 
out, didn't have a whole lot of equipment. I had

21:09.817 --> 21:19.169
some tractor-operated mowers, and I think we had 
two or three small riding mowers. And I remember

21:20.190 --> 21:22.213
thinking, after a got to work and the people were 
going out and there were those three little riding

21:23.054 --> 21:52.656
mowers going out at eight o'clock in the morning 
and competing with that vehicular traffic on

21:23.054 --> 21:52.656
college avenue and just scared the liver out of me 
you know it just you know just hazards everywhere

21:23.054 --> 21:52.656
just but you know we got by that and then ultimately 
probably about five or six months later we wound up

21:53.969 --> 22:22.862
with a portion of the basement of the old hospital 
building that we used as as a work area for the

21:53.969 --> 22:22.862
smaller equipment and things like this so we 
didn't have to road it back and forth you know when

21:53.969 --> 22:22.862
and got rid of a lot of the uh the hazard of the on that 
level how did I'm assuming the two institutions

22:23.450 --> 22:29.459
were similar in size and enrollment and so forth 
then. Probably so. How did the workforce here and

22:30.420 --> 22:35.508
equipment compare with what you left at OU? It was 
not as good here.

22:41.540 --> 22:49.615
because I had worked on equipment up there and had 
gotten it up to what I would consider a decent

22:41.540 --> 22:49.615
level. And that's one of the things Mr. Cherry was 
very active in. He, you

22:54.043 --> 23:04.543
know, I would see a need and talk to Bob and either he 
or I would talk to Mr. Cherry and Tom found two or

23:06.852 --> 23:22.853
three batches of money that I'm not sure where he 
got it but I didn't worry about that at the time and

23:06.852 --> 23:22.853
so we could we could purchase needed equipment 
ranging from oh gosh a small motor grader to riding

23:22.833 --> 23:29.606
type mowers, and just a whole gamut of different 
types of equipment that we needed. And that, we got

23:30.247 --> 23:41.569
the first batch of equipment was probably in the 
summer of 73 and then in the fall of 73, another

23:30.247 --> 23:41.569
batch of equipment. So we were catching up in a 
hurry, you know. And then, by then, I was melded

23:45.209 --> 23:49.593
into the budget thing. Of course, in September of 
73 is when Bob started having knee problems. And I

24:00.003 --> 24:07.790
think he just had surgery at that point in time on 
his good leg. And the doctors told him that he was

24:09.051 --> 24:14.997
going to have to make a choice, that he couldn't 
Both jobs were too demanding, particularly on his

24:15.719 --> 24:25.072
good leg, and that he really needed to give one of 
the jobs up. And so he decided that he would go to the

24:26.454 --> 24:32.302
academic side. And then I went over with Mr. Cherry 
and met with Dr. Williams. and about my assuming

24:42.213 --> 24:50.870
the job of Director of Grounds Maintenance. And we 
talked for a while. And there had been, I think,

24:53.876 --> 24:56.982
some consternation with the academic landscape 
architecture folks about Bob being called

24:58.328 --> 25:03.675
landscape architect. Well, he was. I mean, he's a 
very qualified landscape architect. But the fact

25:06.078 --> 25:10.043
that he wasn't in the academic side and this kind of 
thing, I think, I don't know. And Dr. Williams

25:11.265 --> 25:16.131
says, well, you'll be director of grounds, but you 
won't be landscape architect. You won't be titled

25:17.613 --> 25:19.396
landscape architect. Yeah, that's what it was. 
And I said, well, you know, that's not a problem. I

25:23.081 --> 25:26.445
know what I am, and I know what I can do and that kind 
of thing. And it went that way for several years

25:26.982 --> 25:44.941
before it was changed to director of grounds 
landscape architect again, you know, but, but I

25:26.982 --> 25:44.941
remember that real, real clearly, you know, that 
that was, and I, I, uh, I don't know whether I looked

25:26.982 --> 25:44.941
puzzled or not. And later Mr. Cherry said, well, 
there's a little, little bit of problem there with

25:45.161 --> 25:53.050
some of the academic folks and just passed it off 
on, you know, like that, like Tom would do. In that

25:54.792 --> 25:56.854
and other sessions, What did you sense to be the 
working relationship between Tom Cherry and Jack

25:57.222 --> 26:02.087
Williams?

26:04.950 --> 26:06.732
I sensed that it was good. I didn't sense any

26:07.733 --> 26:15.642
kind of... Mutual trust and respect? Yeah, I think 
so. They seemed to have a very good working

26:18.165 --> 26:21.428
relationship. I know that's great. And I was only 
with both of them. probably a half a dozen times.

26:31.005 --> 26:37.016
Describe Tom Cherry as a human being, and then as a 
supervisor. He was, in my opinion, one of the more

26:38.219 --> 26:45.032
understanding people that I've met.

26:46.801 --> 26:55.202
Tom was extremely knowledgeable in the finance, 
the budget works, and all like this. And I know I,

26:55.783 --> 27:04.725
when I became director of Grounds, Well, going 
back to mid-summer of 1973, that's when we were

27:05.127 --> 27:23.997
setting up, we set up a landscape construction 
section and irrigation, a landscape maintenance

27:05.127 --> 27:23.997
section, and a roads and pavement section. found 
supervisors for each each of those areas and the

27:24.449 --> 27:48.516
landscape construction section was going to 
handle all of the new construction and maintain

27:24.449 --> 27:48.516
the install and maintain irrigation systems this 
kind of thing and as a part of that we were set up with

27:24.449 --> 27:48.516
a local account that's something that had never 
been done with the ground theory and and Mr. Cherry

27:24.449 --> 27:48.516
and Clark Diebel set the thing up, and Bob says, 
okay, you handle the outside, I'll take care of all

27:49.255 --> 27:54.803
this. Well, I didn't have an idea, man of the moon, 
how the local account worked. And when the change

28:00.110 --> 28:12.006
made, it was made rather quickly, and we were still 
tied to the physical plant with an accountant over

28:00.110 --> 28:12.006
in their accounting area, named Marie L. And so BC 
Hurt, who was my number one guy, had been, BC had

28:13.910 --> 28:22.820
been here for like 35 years or so. H-E-R-T. 
H-U-R-T. H-U-R-T Hurt. Yeah, BC. He had no name,

28:30.830 --> 28:33.092
just initials, BC. And in December And we'd been 
working out of a local account, you know, and all

28:38.868 --> 28:41.854
like this. And I got a call in December, early 
December of, no, just before Christmas of 73. And I

28:50.691 --> 28:52.775
got a call from Marie. And she said, sir, you need to 
come over here. So I went over there. She said,

28:57.443 --> 28:59.167
you've got a problem. You're $60,000 in the red. 
And I thought, oh, geez. And so it was probably a day

29:04.917 --> 29:08.623
or two before Christmas break. I spent the most 
miserable Christmas break I have ever spent in all

29:09.124 --> 29:15.575
my life, wondering why I'd ever come down here. And 
my wife still doesn't know. I've never said

29:20.102 --> 29:21.144
anything. And I made up my mind. that I needed to go 
talk to Tom Cherry. So first day back I called and I

29:27.597 --> 29:31.165
said, Mr. Cherry, I need to come talk to you. I've 
got a problem. Went up and I laid it all out and he

29:33.009 --> 29:36.356
said, yeah, you've got a problem. I thought, oh, 
man. and he said you need somebody to mind your

29:38.656 --> 29:56.800
business and so he called downstairs and got Clark 
Diebel brought him up and they set some things up

29:38.656 --> 29:56.800
and then he called I guess Logan Council was 
director of physical plant at that point in time

29:38.656 --> 29:56.800
yeah and the upshot was they moved Marie Allen over 
physically to us and Clark set up some he set us up on

29:58.113 --> 30:23.149
how to handle the local account and you know and 
once I got into it it was pretty simple I just didn't

29:58.113 --> 30:23.149
know that if you spin it you had to make it kind of 
thing and so by uh between B.C. Hurt and Bill

30:23.189 --> 30:25.673
Vittlepill who was He was working half-time. He 
was half-time horticulture, half-time grounds,

30:27.503 --> 30:33.552
and ultimately came over full-time the next year. 
But between the three or four of us, we were out of

30:34.634 --> 30:43.608
the red by March of 74, you know, learned a valuable 
lesson. But like I say, Tom Cherry didn't faze him,

30:44.329 --> 30:48.755
you know. He just said, you need somebody to mind 
your business, you know. Now, in hindsight, was

30:52.147 --> 30:56.633
that whole matter handled appropriately? Oh, 
yeah. Yeah, I figured I was going to be fired,

30:57.375 --> 31:06.568
frankly, because, I mean, $60,000, you know. 
Clark Diebel, describe him. Clark was one of the

31:09.512 --> 31:12.656
more helpful guys. I mean, any time I needed a 
problem solved or had a problem with money or

31:13.257 --> 31:20.027
accounts or anything like that, I could always 
call Clark. And he had an answer. He always had an

31:28.222 --> 31:29.207
answer.
