00:02.107 --> 00:06.433
Colonel Frank G. This is a test, this is a test. This 
is an interview with Colonel Frank G. Anderson,

00:08.436 --> 00:25.600
head coach, Texas A&M Track, 1922 to 1935, 1946 to 
1957, and Commandant of the Corps of Cadets, 1935

00:08.436 --> 00:25.600
to 1937.

00:26.845 --> 00:28.006
This is a test. This is the 26th of July, 1983. This 
is Terry Anderson. 26th of July, 1983. This is a

00:36.337 --> 00:39.481
test. So can we start there? Yes. Okay, this is an 
interview with Frank G. Anderson at his home and

00:41.263 --> 00:46.450
college station. And we are going to start off 
talking about how you got to A&M. I know it dealt

00:53.359 --> 00:55.722
with Mr. Bibles. Are we ready? Yeah. Before we talk 
about A&M, I would like to include the name of D.X.

01:08.725 --> 01:12.189
Bob in my past history. He was my prep school coach 
back in Tennessee at Brandon Training School. I

01:19.738 --> 01:23.042
graduated from White County High School up at 
Sparta, Tennessee. I made a good many touchdowns.

01:31.291 --> 01:35.095
Two touchdowns was against a school named 
Fitzgerald Clark. And at that time, it was a young

01:36.396 --> 01:41.883
coach beginning his career there. And

01:43.845 --> 01:52.354
I scored four touchdowns against his team. Right 
over in the adjoining county there was another

01:52.638 --> 02:01.058
young coach having his first year at Shelbyville, 
Tennessee.

02:05.609 --> 02:09.398
They played each other.

02:13.158 --> 02:21.952
I made enough touchdowns against this team, this 
prep school team, Fitzgerald and Clark, at

02:13.158 --> 02:21.952
Tallahoma. I made four touchdowns playing on the 
White County High School team. I didn't have any

02:29.023 --> 02:31.166
money to go to college. I was offered a $40 job as 
freight clerk in the depot. at the end of a branch

02:36.310 --> 02:38.794
line on the railway. But then, thank goodness, a 
boy, the son of the headmaster at Brandon Training

02:38.834 --> 02:56.580
School,

02:38.834 --> 02:56.580
the son came up there and recruited me to go an extra 
year in prep school. I didn't, as I say, I had very

02:58.535 --> 03:17.300
few prospects of ever going to college, and so I 
thought maybe if I went down there and did pretty

02:58.535 --> 03:17.300
well, maybe somebody would offer me a scholarship 
or help me get a job to have a scholarship. So I went

03:18.222 --> 03:28.035
down there, and then this young coach down there in 
his first year, D. X. Bible,

03:29.534 --> 03:32.921
was just a fine young man. He was a good Christian 
man, Baptist Church, and he taught a Sunday school

03:33.422 --> 03:40.938
class at Shelbyville. And it just so happened that 
the preacher at this Baptist church, happened to

03:49.447 --> 04:03.173
be a graduate from Mississippi College, which is 
kind of the Baylor of Mississippi, and they were

03:49.447 --> 04:03.173
looking for a coach. And Coach Bible did real well, 
and I did pretty well, too, I guess, because he

04:03.955 --> 04:11.910
says, boy, you're going to college with me. So I 
went to college with DX Bible down there and we had a

04:12.363 --> 04:17.969
very fine year. He stayed there three years and he 
did so well that the people out at A&M heard about

04:18.029 --> 04:30.401
him and they gave him a job. He came over here and he 
did real well for two or three years. His team's

04:36.727 --> 04:38.809
already been scored on. Both he and I, though, went 
into World War I, and when the World War I was over, I

04:39.953 --> 04:48.885
had finished my time at Mississippi College. We 
had won the state championship. We had beaten

04:51.609 --> 04:52.870
Tulane. We had scored on Alabama. And we beat 
Mississippi State, and we never did lose the

04:55.554 --> 05:03.404
University of Mississippi. One time we beat that 
team 74 to 7, where you believe it or not, we did it.

05:10.379 --> 05:15.905
And so, D.X.

05:15.925 --> 05:23.834
then, he was just getting started over here, and he 
had just been here before the war as a freshman

05:15.925 --> 05:23.834
coach, I guess. Maybe one year more than that. But 
he wasn't athletic director until one year after

05:27.799 --> 05:33.265
the war was over. I went back to Mississippi 
College after the war was over. I'm now a major in

05:37.750 --> 05:39.492
the Army. I happened to go in there as a captain. I 
guess I was the only captain in World War I that had

05:42.931 --> 05:48.337
never had a uniform on or saluted anybody. But

05:49.699 --> 05:57.808
he offered me a position. He said, you go on coach at 
Mississippi College one year and then come on out

05:58.109 --> 06:04.876
there and be my freshman coach. Now I have covered 
that tile up to explain how I got here and who

06:07.096 --> 06:13.814
brought me here. That was my best friend in the 
world, the ex-bible. Can you describe the type of

06:17.885 --> 06:19.991
person? Can you describe what type of person Bible 
was? Would you describe him? Oh, as I said, he was a

06:26.784 --> 06:46.772
fine enough character back in Shelbyville, 
Tennessee that that preacher at that Baptist

06:26.784 --> 06:46.772
school where he taught that Sunday school class 
recommended him in every way to go and said, you

06:26.784 --> 06:46.772
better hire the man. He went down there and he 
impressed them and they offered him the job. He

06:52.601 --> 06:58.368
stayed with that job for three years.

06:58.989 --> 07:04.516
Could you tell me a little bit about World War I, 
your experience in World War I? Well, Mississippi

07:05.056 --> 07:13.747
College furnished a rifle company to the 
Confederacy. When World War I broke out, they

07:17.397 --> 07:19.981
wanted a unit into the army. And this good old 
patriotic president just, he just practically

07:21.243 --> 07:34.663
got us all to, who were at least wanted to, enough to 
form a battery of field artillery. These boys

07:35.892 --> 07:39.300
elected their own captain. They elected me 
captain. And the reason they elected me captain, I

07:41.927 --> 07:47.280
had scored lots of touchdowns in football. I 
happened to be a class president. over there and I

07:51.755 --> 08:01.045
might have made a mistake in leaving Mississippi 
because if I stayed there I believe I could have

07:51.755 --> 08:01.045
been elected to the governor of the state. Later on 
one of the boys I coached was elected to the

08:01.065 --> 08:05.890
governor of the state and that over there. Now

08:06.751 --> 08:11.376
the war is over. Where did you go in the war? Did you 
go to Europe? Oh yes, I was in the artillery, he was

08:16.301 --> 08:19.585
in the air force. And we were over there a year. You 
were in France? In France, yes. Okay, can we stop

08:26.696 --> 08:28.980
just for a minute? Okay. Now let's continue as soon 
as the war is over.

08:36.554 --> 08:40.662
DX had a little...

08:42.886 --> 08:57.828
summer get-together, his sister and a friend, a 
girl from Texas, he and I were at a little summer

08:42.886 --> 08:57.828
resort for a few days and he offered me the job to 
come out here. But he says, I can't, I'm not in

08:59.370 --> 09:03.436
charge for one year. After one year, the man who's 
on the job will be gone and I'll have his place. And

09:09.966 --> 09:12.049
so I took that job for a year and then I came out here 
as his freshman coach in 1920. Now,

09:16.173 --> 09:31.554
Mississippi College had never, had never scored 
on Mississippi State or University of

09:16.173 --> 09:31.554
Mississippi or Alabama or Tulane or those teams. 
We played them a warm-up game for them, always, but

09:32.235 --> 09:38.323
by golly, The first year we played Ole Miss, it was a 
7-7 tie. The next year, we just mercilessly

09:44.952 --> 09:51.961
slaughtered them, as I've told you. The score was 
74-7. Then we went right on down, and

09:53.703 --> 10:07.281
I just happened to make an 80-yard run against 
Mississippi State. That game up there, his first

10:08.577 --> 10:17.464
game and my first game in football, I guess 
something happened that had never happened in a

10:08.577 --> 10:17.464
football game. We led Mississippi State up on 
their campus at the end of the half, 14 to nothing.

10:24.831 --> 10:27.613
But we had gone up there with 14 players. We didn't 
have a big squad. But he had only a guarantee of $250

10:31.396 --> 10:38.382
and he had to clear a little money, so he goes up 
there with with 12 men. No, with 14 men. That's

10:42.674 --> 10:44.216
right, he had 14 men. And when you play both ways, 
offensive and defensive, against a big squad,

10:45.258 --> 10:53.993
you're in pretty good shape after that first half 
is over with. And so with five minutes to play, They

10:58.342 --> 11:02.828
were leading us 14 to 13, and we didn't have 11 men 
that could stand up. And so we just go out of this

11:03.749 --> 11:08.315
other team and said, Du Bois, you know we can't play 
you anymore. You're ahead of us now. Let's quit.

11:11.679 --> 11:14.342
They said, all right, we'll just quit. And we went 
over and told the coaches that we had decided to

11:14.362 --> 11:18.688
call the game off. And they were winning 14 to 13. 
And that's the only time that ever happened to

11:20.991 --> 11:24.535
them. history of college football on without a 
doubt. Well then, next week we go down to Tulane.

11:34.519 --> 11:37.022
There's a young coach down there by the name of 
Shaughnessy. He

11:37.503 --> 11:44.413
and Dix had all gone up to see old Doc Williams up at 
Minnesota. He was a famous old coach. He was having

11:47.535 --> 11:49.138
a coaching school. Well these two young freshman 
college coaches, both getting ready to go to be a

11:49.578 --> 11:55.788
college coach this coming year. One of them was 
going to coach at Tulane, the other one was going to

11:56.469 --> 12:01.837
coach at Mississippi College. They were going to 
meet each other, so they put up a bet that when the

12:02.559 --> 12:11.953
game was over in New Orleans that fall, that the 
loser would pay for the supper. All right, we go

12:12.237 --> 12:13.960
down there. Now I don't know, we had already played 
Mississippi State a 14-13 game. I guess that's the

12:21.832 --> 12:24.556
only part that got in. But this young coach down 
there, Shaughnessy, decided that since he's

12:24.576 --> 12:33.790
playing a team that never had done anything in the 
past, except just fill in a date for a warm-up game.

12:38.505 --> 12:43.232
He'd just go up to LSU and scout LSU, turn the game 
over to his captain. Well, the poor guy was pretty

12:43.272 --> 12:49.782
badly shocked when he came home and found his team 
was beat. Well, I just happened to make a run there

12:51.605 --> 13:02.562
in that game that the

12:51.605 --> 13:02.562
people put it in the paper. We beat them. We beat 
Kool-Aid. And of course next year the guy stayed at

13:06.517 --> 13:12.348
home when we played him. We went down and beat him 
again. So that's the way things went. So D. X.

13:17.357 --> 13:23.267
Bottle got a job out here on account of his record 
over there with a school that had never done

13:17.357 --> 13:23.267
anything. Now, Bible's record here was 
outstanding. And I was wondering why it was so

13:27.362 --> 13:30.909
good. What were some of the things that he taught 
his men? I mean, there were years in which no one

13:36.179 --> 13:40.868
scored on his team. Or no one scored against him. 
For two or three years. Yes, I was wondering why was

13:45.125 --> 13:47.931
he so good? Did you know that his teams usually won 
seven to nothing or fourteen or nothing or

13:48.472 --> 13:56.128
fourteen or something? Yeah. He never scored any 
scores much. He had a fine defense and some fine

13:59.410 --> 14:02.373
kickers. And he just beat them that way. He beat 
them on defense then. Yeah. Now we're going to come

14:08.721 --> 14:13.146
back to A&M and A&M Athletics. OK.

14:13.166 --> 14:17.611
DX's record was good. But DX did not believe in 
giving anybody one cent to come to play on his team.

14:27.558 --> 14:33.548
James Sullivan was more interested in bricks than 
he was in equipment or anything else. He wanted to

14:33.889 --> 14:35.372
build a stadium. Between the two of them, they 
built a stadium. But between the two of them, they

14:40.140 --> 14:44.908
ran completely out of material. Lusher Stark, a 
rich old man, was taking care of Texas with some

14:46.981 --> 14:52.406
help from some other people. The Dallas 
businessmen were taking care of SMU. The Rice

14:59.412 --> 15:07.959
people, certainly Rice is a fine great team, and 
I'm not besmirching them any whatsoever. But

15:08.420 --> 15:11.442
Houston probably helped them out too, you see. And 
here we sat with not giving anybody anything.

15:17.423 --> 15:19.466
Party X ran out of a team. He saw the handwriting on 
the wall and he left A&M. He put them up and then he

15:26.376 --> 15:37.712
let them slide down, but he let them slide down 
because he was honestly

15:26.376 --> 15:37.712
an amateur. He hadn't been used to, he helped me 
out. He helped me out, but after one year he didn't

15:44.660 --> 15:58.960
have to help me out much because I told those 
people, get me that laundry job and let me pick up

15:44.660 --> 15:58.960
the dirty shirts and collars and I'll make my way in 
there. That's the kind of a scholarship I had over

15:59.281 --> 16:02.305
there that first year. Well, so much for that. So 
much for that.

16:09.695 --> 16:11.578
Now,

16:15.625 --> 16:23.111
I've

16:15.625 --> 16:23.111
lost my line. Okay. I'd like to... find out about 
when you became the head track coach in 1922. How

16:29.917 --> 16:31.358
did that happen? You came over here in 1920 to be the 
freshman baseball, basketball and track coach

16:31.659 --> 16:42.008
and then in 1922 you became the head coach. I 
haven't told you about Charlie Cummings and the

16:42.108 --> 16:49.074
first thing that they gave us, first job. I would 
just like to explain why I have tried to explain why

16:54.252 --> 17:11.791
A&M didn't do too well in his latter years, but when 
he left here and went to Nebraska, good old Matty

16:54.252 --> 17:11.791
Bale came here as his successor.

17:14.875 --> 17:16.777
But Matty didn't have anything. He actually let 
things run out to nothing, just going down to where

17:16.937 --> 17:23.584
we couldn't play a decent, Much more than a decent 
high school team almost. But Matty Bell had... Why

17:29.729 --> 17:33.213
did DX let this happen? Because he wouldn't give 
anybody a dollar to come here. No scholarships.

17:38.438 --> 17:41.961
Everybody out was bringing them in and he wasn't 
bringing them in. He didn't want to bring them in.

17:43.983 --> 17:45.084
Why didn't he want to? Because he was an amateur. He 
believed that... He believed that... We

17:53.450 --> 17:56.115
shouldn't hire athletes.

17:57.798 --> 18:06.033
But when he left here to go to Nebraska, he realized 
that he either had to quit coaching or do what the

17:57.798 --> 18:06.033
others were doing. He went to Nebraska when they 
were down, but he got all he could get at Nebraska.

18:14.448 --> 18:16.572
And he built a team up there. that was a champion. 
Texas heard about him, knew about him, they knew

18:19.406 --> 18:32.428
about what he had done to them in the earlier years 
here and they hired him to come back to Texas and

18:19.406 --> 18:32.428
they were on the very bottom and he helped them back 
up. And now we'll just have to say thank you to good

18:32.448 --> 18:40.602
old DX and go on from there and take up Matty Bell. 
When Matty came here, He had very, very little

18:44.362 --> 18:47.245
talent. He had a little old backfield. I don't 
think any of them were bigger than I am. And I

18:53.433 --> 18:54.834
weighed about 140. And they were slow. And of 
course he couldn't do any good. He didn't do any

19:02.664 --> 19:03.905
good. After about three years, they fired Matty.

19:15.040 --> 19:22.862
The first man under a scholarship when he came down 
here was a boy by the name of Charlie Cummings. He

19:22.942 --> 19:25.890
was a brown boy and a very fine football player. He 
came out here, now Matty, is on the job. But DX and

19:32.393 --> 19:43.490
Sully had got together and they promised the boy if 
he'd come out here, they would pay him $25 to sweep

19:32.393 --> 19:43.490
out to our field house. That's the first money that 
A&M ever paid for an athlete. What year was that?

19:49.600 --> 19:54.427
That was in the year of, it was Matty Bell's first 
year. I would say it was, say, 33.

20:00.856 --> 20:03.619
Just as a guess, I'd say that's what it was. Poor old 
Charlie got ineligible. He didn't pass his work

20:09.605 --> 20:12.928
and he lost his job and he lost his $25. Isn't that 
something? Yeah, that's too bad. That's all the

20:16.872 --> 20:26.261
money was spent when Matty Bill's first year was 
$25 on Charlie Cummings and he didn't make the

20:16.872 --> 20:26.261
grade. He didn't ever help us in it. Matty didn't 
have a chance. And they fired that man without even

20:31.538 --> 20:37.945
talking to him. He read it in the paper that he was 
fired. I loved old Matty Bell. Why? Because he was

20:45.753 --> 20:47.515
such a fine fella. He was a crackerjack coach 
because he had beaten the heck out of us a number of

20:48.036 --> 20:53.622
years before we brought him down here. That's when 
we hired him. But if you don't win, you don't last.

20:58.670 --> 20:59.211
Yeah.

21:01.954 --> 21:09.204
Now,

21:01.954 --> 21:09.204
next year up at SMU, you know what he did? Went to the 
Rose Bowl.

21:13.750 --> 21:14.931
That just shows us up. That showed up the people who 
are running things down here. Farmer students

21:19.837 --> 21:24.103
have got no business running outfits. Listen, as 
track coach, I have never asked a former student

21:25.028 --> 21:36.034
to give me a dollar for track. I've had Charlie 
Babcock and Jimmy Williams who worked for Tyree

21:37.398 --> 21:51.344
Bell at Dallas helped me land the first two boys I 
ever gave scholarships to. Not the first two, I

21:51.425 --> 21:55.913
gave a scholarship to another one before I did 
them. Those two boys helped me win championships.

21:59.313 --> 22:02.178
We wouldn't have won championships without those 
two boys. But I gave only six full-time

22:02.759 --> 22:08.648
scholarships in all of my time here. And I coached 
13 years after they started giving scholarships.

22:15.098 --> 22:17.803
We wouldn't have won without those people. We 
never would have won a championship without those

22:18.203 --> 22:21.629
six boys. But I never had over Two of them might have 
been on the same team at one time, but they made the

22:24.192 --> 22:29.458
difference. But the others were made by boys who 
had never

22:31.120 --> 22:43.535
won first places in a conference in the Texas meet. 
The first athlete I ever had, I've been out of

22:43.555 --> 22:49.322
coaching now, for a 12 year interval. I come back to 
coaching. After the war was over I had that first

22:54.045 --> 22:56.850
interval. I didn't do too well because of the life 
in A&M College. They drove off more freshmen than

23:05.042 --> 23:10.090
they kept in some outfits. My boys were The boys 
that I would have recruited if I'd had any money to

23:14.395 --> 23:27.293
recruit or try to talk into coming here didn't come 
in most cases because they heard how rough and

23:14.395 --> 23:27.293
tough A&M College was. And those that did come, 
some of them got run off. Because of hazing? On

23:33.040 --> 23:34.703
account of hazing, yes. A&M

23:36.505 --> 23:42.293
was a fraternity. As long as it was just a military 
school, it was a fraternity. That fraternity had

23:47.095 --> 23:51.220
lasted 12 years, one full year. Some kids couldn't 
take it. We have had people start in with 35

23:56.746 --> 24:01.552
freshmen and end up with 10.

24:04.836 --> 24:08.280
I couldn't win with this school. against other 
schools who are now going out and giving track men

24:09.610 --> 24:14.058
scholarships.

24:16.402 --> 24:27.642
I wouldn't have taken the job, I don't think it's 
common then,

24:16.402 --> 24:27.642
if we'd had a chance at the boys. But upperclassmen 
would respect the football freshmen. But a poor

24:34.552 --> 24:36.376
track freshman. What the heck with track? That's 
no sport. They'd just give him just like they would

24:39.662 --> 24:52.547
any other freshman and here's a boy that was good 
enough to win a mile back there and he's up here, he

24:39.662 --> 24:52.547
wants some good for nothing sophomore paddling 
him or doing what they want to do with him. Well,

24:52.567 --> 24:53.910
they just won't take it. The sons of these people 
who were my first years out here didn't come when

24:54.987 --> 25:04.996
their daddies talked about A&M College and what 
they had to go through. Rough stuff, real stuff,

25:06.437 --> 25:09.801
Texas A&M. That was their yell and that was their 
life.

25:15.606 --> 25:20.390
Let's talk about those years when you were the 
first, during the 1920s. Tell me about during the

25:20.510 --> 25:24.454
1920s. Now we'll go into

25:24.603 --> 25:39.943
what

25:24.603 --> 25:39.943
you, from 1920 on. We didn't- How did you become the 
head track coach? In 1921, I came out here in 20, in

25:48.346 --> 25:55.356
the spring of 21, I was assistant track coach. But 
back in high school, I was the champion pole

25:57.559 --> 26:05.671
vaulter of the state of Tennessee in 1912. And I was 
a good sprinter.

26:14.064 --> 26:15.045
They, uh,

26:19.852 --> 26:23.236
Oh, to heck, where am I? How did you become the head 
track coach? I was interested in track in other

26:27.861 --> 26:29.904
words. Yes, yes, I know. Rothgeb had been a track 
man on the University of Illinois. He was DX's

26:36.031 --> 26:40.336
line coach.

26:46.583 --> 26:48.525
I learned a lot of track from him. I was a track man in 
high school, but I learned a lot of track from him,

26:48.742 --> 27:00.655
and I had the job after one year as his assistant in 
track. What happened to him? He stayed here for

27:02.797 --> 27:10.125
four years, and then he and somebody else went down 
to Rice, left us to go to Rice. In those days now, DX

27:10.846 --> 27:14.790
was, we had three coaches. DX was head football 
coach, He also coached basketball. Rothkopf

27:20.468 --> 27:22.511
coaches baseball. I coach track. So then for 12, 12 
or 13 years I was, that was the setup. When did you,

27:30.981 --> 27:36.929
when, when and how did the position of athletic 
director come about? I never have been athletic

27:38.571 --> 27:40.193
director. I know you haven't, but when did that 
come about? Do you remember? Well, they always had

27:44.446 --> 27:46.828
an athletic director here. D.X. was athletic 
director. He was athletic director and... Matty

27:48.830 --> 27:52.593
Bell was athletic director. Always the football 
coach was athletic director. I see. We have never

27:55.675 --> 27:57.517
had it otherwise. And it is a rotten way to be. Why? A 
school as big as this ought to have an athletic

28:01.621 --> 28:04.563
director. It didn't coach anything. You can't 
tell me that all

28:07.065 --> 28:14.031
sports are... equally handled

28:15.226 --> 28:21.673
if the... I like this football coach. I don't want 
to antagonize him, but I say that any big school

28:23.735 --> 28:30.101
ought to have an athletic director who coached 
nothing. But he ought to have been a fine athlete.

28:32.764 --> 28:34.406
He ought to have known athletics. But now that's 
just my opinion. That's my opinion, and a pretty

28:38.850 --> 28:41.773
strong opinion too. but I've been able to get along 
with all the athletic directors here. I got along

28:46.034 --> 28:49.039
mighty fine with Burr Bryant.

28:54.148 --> 28:56.231
I've got a funny story to tell you about Burr. When

28:57.994 --> 29:05.787
he came here and talking to him, I just brought up, 
the subject came up and I thought he had heard about

29:07.420 --> 29:13.709
it and I said, that's the reason I resigned. He 
said, you did what? I said, well they published in

29:16.133 --> 29:28.872
the paper that when you came you could make a clean 
sweep of the whole deal here and I just decided I

29:16.133 --> 29:28.872
wouldn't let, I'd make it easier on you and I'd just 
resign.

29:32.615 --> 29:33.957
And, which I did. Honestly, I did. I said, here I've 
stayed here all these years and I've done pretty

29:35.319 --> 29:47.618
well because we had already won six championships 
in those other years. And

29:48.540 --> 29:53.868
we went and fell to third one time. Now, so when he 
said, you did what? I said, yes. I did, but I told

30:01.235 --> 30:08.724
them at the time, I didn't want to leave. I love it 
here, but by golly, I'm not going to let them fire

30:08.845 --> 30:13.170
me, so I'm resigning. And old Bones Irvin, who was 
then the athletic director, said, now Frank, you

30:13.991 --> 30:19.218
know they didn't mean you. I said, well, they said 
so. They said he'd make a clean sweep, and I'm in the

30:21.300 --> 30:24.344
department. I said, all right now, Bones, I've 
been here. I've been here all these years. I've

30:30.766 --> 30:32.388
subsidized track. I've taken boys in my car and 
gone to Chicago for two of them and you give me $50 to

30:32.628 --> 30:38.614
do it. I've taken sandwiches and gone halfway to 
the drug relays and going to the border Olympics

30:39.275 --> 30:47.643
and things like that and you haven't paid me 
anything. I stayed here when they offered me more

30:47.683 --> 30:51.267
money to go to Rice. Now you just go over to Texas 
University and find out what they're paying Clyde

30:51.907 --> 30:56.672
Littlefield. We have beaten him six out of the last 
seven years.

31:04.824 --> 31:06.326
By golly, I'm as good as he is. You go there and find 
out what they're paying him, and I'll stay. And

31:13.192 --> 31:14.113
they did it. And I told that story to Paul Bryant. 
And he says, how much they paying you? I told him,

31:22.721 --> 31:27.165
it's not enough.

31:27.466 --> 31:29.268
So he gave me a little raise. Isn't that a good 
story? Oh, Lordy. Now, now. I was wondering why you

31:37.315 --> 31:43.560
resigned from the head track coach back in 1935. 
Why'd you decide to resign? Oh, the commandant had

31:46.343 --> 31:51.167
gone. Yeah. I came out of World War I as a major, and 
in the meantime I had done all the work necessary as

31:57.807 --> 32:01.596
an active reserve officer. Went to camp every 
summer and things like that. And I was now a full

32:05.104 --> 32:07.630
colonel.

32:11.440 --> 32:14.567
I've got a lot of trophies back there I want you to 
look at before you leave.

32:18.749 --> 32:21.492
So you worked your way up in the reserve. Yes. And 
you were a full colonel by 1935. Yes, and so here's a

32:23.714 --> 32:29.320
man that's gone and leaving them. And he told me 
that this place is going to blow up. He did? What was

32:36.608 --> 32:37.849
his name? He didn't like the way things were 
running at A&M College. Why?

32:46.964 --> 32:50.928
some outfits started in with 30 and ended up with 
10. Now,

32:53.251 --> 33:00.739
well, I'm not doing as well as I want to do in track. I 
don't have a good chance and the school isn't

33:00.759 --> 33:03.942
growing. I came out here, it was 1700, now after 12 
years it's just 3500. But they're losing too many

33:12.361 --> 33:16.788
people in the freshman class. I took that job with 
my eyes wide open. I challenged the system. I'm the

33:23.879 --> 33:26.844
first man to challenge this system. In what way? 
Tell me about it. Well, when I first was here, I'm

33:30.149 --> 33:36.098
the brand new commandant. We have a bonfire. Here 
comes a very irate man in my office the morning

33:38.568 --> 33:49.126
after the bonfire and those damn boys carried off 
my log barn last night and put it on the bonfire.

33:54.836 --> 33:57.120
I made them pay that man for that barn. I just called 
the captain's end and said, you're going to pay for

33:58.222 --> 34:00.846
it. Collect it up from your companies. I paid the 
man. And I said, you're not going to build a bonfire

34:05.095 --> 34:07.518
next year. I'm going to build a bonfire. And it's 
going to be a legal bonfire. I took the bull ring.

34:14.886 --> 34:20.572
The bull ring or the freshman now that didn't 
carry, got caught carrying you some food in the

34:14.886 --> 34:20.572
mess hall maybe. Or anything else they want to ram a 
freshman for. Of course, they didn't want to ram

34:25.008 --> 34:33.317
the freshmen for that, but old John King caught 
food on the freshmen and he gave them eight rams.

34:37.481 --> 34:44.208
Now that thing right there, now there's so many 
other things that happened. Why don't you

34:44.228 --> 34:47.331
continue about the legal bonfire? Yeah, the legal 
bonfire. Next year I got some saws and axes and some

34:50.000 --> 34:56.793
transportation from the building and grounds 
department. And I took the bull ring. The bull ring

34:59.438 --> 35:10.540
is composed of freshmen and maybe a few sophomores 
who weren't necessarily breaking college

34:59.438 --> 35:10.540
regulations but they're breaking student body 
regulations. Well I took those kids out there and I

35:11.650 --> 35:15.855
got on the end of the saw just like they did. Some up 
and took my turns and we cut down enough old trees

35:15.935 --> 35:28.869
and other trees between here and the airport 
because in those days there wasn't anything but

35:15.935 --> 35:28.869
trees on the other side of where the baseball 
stadium is. And we built a bonfire of logs. When I

35:34.074 --> 35:37.979
show you this picture in here, it's my brain child. 
It's the same It's the same thing and all we had to do

35:40.102 --> 35:48.192
that was one year and that started a new tradition 
and that's my tradition. Not a bonfire but that

35:48.733 --> 35:54.520
kind of bonfire, that's my baby because we built 
it. And I told these boys you're not going to be

35:55.281 --> 36:00.507
allowed to put one thing on that bonfire. If I catch 
you putting the thing on that bonfire I'm going to

36:00.688 --> 36:06.615
campus you during football season next year. 
Because you just, I'm just going to allow you to

36:08.536 --> 36:23.855
pill, they burned the faculty's wood piles, they 
burned the outhouses, they burned anything they

36:08.536 --> 36:23.855
could gather, plus what the merchants gave them, 
old boxes and cartons and things like that. And

36:23.875 --> 36:29.623
they made an excellent bonfire because they 
caught fires so quick and burned up in the herd and

36:23.875 --> 36:29.623
weren't so darn big. It's a shame they're burning 
all these good logs, I love trees. I just had to do

36:36.127 --> 36:39.452
something about that bonfire. Okay, what were 
some of the other problems that you dealt with as

36:39.472 --> 36:43.858
commandants? They used to have a silly thing of 
throwing toilet paper. Sometimes at a game they'd

36:48.645 --> 36:58.759
throw toilet paper and there was a lot of it there 
and I told the boys, now you've got to quit throwing

36:48.645 --> 36:58.759
that toilet paper.

36:59.920 --> 37:03.784
And then I got him to wear the toilet paper. And I 
remember this story. Now we're first trip, court

37:06.046 --> 37:09.730
trip, going up to Fort Worth. I got on that special 
car. I'm the commandant now. I'm the wife now. I got

37:15.456 --> 37:18.359
the guess of the man who's running the railroad. 
He's washing the car. I got him on that thing, and I

37:19.440 --> 37:24.685
was thinking about stopping him throwing all that 
darn toilet paper. And I said, I said, I hope we

37:30.295 --> 37:34.261
don't, I just don't believe we got a lot of toilet 
paper on the train today. I didn't explain to him.

37:37.385 --> 37:38.507
And he was just shocked. He says, I just hope we 
haven't overlooked that thing. I said, oh no, no, I

37:42.713 --> 37:45.577
should have explained myself. I said, I don't 
think the boys are all loaded down with toilet

37:46.298 --> 37:51.966
paper so they can throw up this football game.

37:55.338 --> 38:00.424
Oh we managed to get rid of the toilet paper without 
any problem much. The student body was pretty

38:00.444 --> 38:03.588
reasonable in that thing. All right now but the 
first Friday night here they had they aired out the

38:04.690 --> 38:11.538
freshmen. They'd get their belts and boy they had 
belt them as far as they could do it until they ran

38:11.558 --> 38:19.748
them clear off the campus and they don't you show up 
here till tomorrow. Well I don't know. I went along

38:23.485 --> 38:25.608
with them. But after the next, the second year now, 
second year after they aired them out, I went out

38:26.849 --> 38:38.564
there and I said, now all right now boys, that's 
just, you got them all gone now, let's air them in.

38:38.884 --> 38:39.605
Let's air them in. And they cooperated with me. We 
all got together and they agreed with me, fine,

38:42.769 --> 38:46.814
it's a good thing too to air them in. And what did 
that mean, air them in? Bring them back and let them

38:49.598 --> 38:52.041
sleep in their own beds. which for years they 
hadn't been allowed to, first Friday night at the

38:52.392 --> 39:01.984
yellow practice, first yellow practice. Now 
that's the end of the second year, but now in the

39:02.004 --> 39:18.265
second year there was one, and I was, I tried to talk 
them out of it, but there's one man named Frank

39:02.004 --> 39:18.265
Slacker, thank goodness, he wouldn't let his boys 
He wouldn't let anybody run in one of his freshmen

39:19.190 --> 39:23.676
out of his dormitory. He's the first. He was a 
cadet? He would not let them air out. They didn't

39:29.203 --> 39:30.525
have to air out. He just said it's the foolishness. 
But now, also, also, the air go down here, the train

39:33.168 --> 39:39.897
comes down here. The freshman class is down there, 
all of them with brooms, and they hold the train up

39:40.839 --> 39:46.446
while they sweep out the trains. That's a fine 
thing for a big college to be doing, isn't it?

39:55.967 --> 39:58.610
Somebody had to challenge this outfit. I was 
having a hard time getting freshmen to come and to

39:59.912 --> 40:03.276
stay here. I've got an opportunity now to do 
something about it. And Harry Boyer said, boy, you

40:07.442 --> 40:11.747
were the toughest commandant I ever saw. I didn't 
last but two years. We had a lot of confrontations.

40:20.529 --> 40:23.052
Now, for instance, you had to do something like 
this. They tell me that I passed through the campus

40:24.594 --> 40:31.643
last night and somebody was drilling the boys at 3 
o'clock. So I go up there and find out what's going

40:32.244 --> 40:34.307
on. Sophomore out drilling the freshman at 2 or 3 
o'clock in the morning. Well, I got out an order.

40:41.917 --> 40:43.078
You can't do that. You just gotta quit doing that. 
But they don't pay attention to the orders you get

40:46.690 --> 40:49.093
out. You have to enforce them. So on the night or 
two, I went up there about two or three o'clock, and

40:52.858 --> 40:58.245
here was some sophomore out drilling the 
freshman. I said, all right, sophomore, take

40:59.346 --> 41:02.890
these boys and put them back to bed. You go with me. 
We went to woke up the first sergeant. All right,

41:06.855 --> 41:09.859
first sergeant, you come on and wake that damn 
captain up. Asked them, why are you doing sleeping

41:10.733 --> 41:13.636
here? The boys out drilling, some darn sophomore 
out drilling these boys in here, you're sleeping.

41:20.662 --> 41:26.468
If that happens again, Bud, you're gonna get up and 
drill them while the freshmen sleep. No more done.

41:27.489 --> 41:29.391
It stops, you see, it stops. The carrier food, now 
this, we're nearing the end of my second year now.

41:36.678 --> 41:37.939
The next thing happens, All these years I've been 
ramming fresh, I've been having in force rounds

41:40.248 --> 41:48.799
for freshmen for taking food out of the mess hall. 
Freshmen don't need breakfast, they eat

41:48.819 --> 41:51.522
breakfast. But they take it to some boy that wants 
to sleep and have something to eat. So he makes a

41:56.368 --> 41:58.230
freshman bring him some food. Old John King 
catches him and gives him eight demerits. I send

42:03.397 --> 42:07.302
for the darn freshman and I say, freshman, I'm not 
gonna go ask you anything. You'd have to lie to me.

42:09.610 --> 42:22.963
You wouldn't dare tell me who you did that for, 
because that is the one percent that cannot be

42:09.610 --> 42:22.963
pardoned for in this Corps, is to squeal on an 
upperclassman. But when you're a sophomore next

42:22.983 --> 42:30.691
year, doggone you, I'd be mad enough to come over 
here and tell me you made the freshman. I'm not

42:30.791 --> 42:32.493
doing too much for you. And I won't do anything for 
the freshman. They don't pay attention to you.

42:38.062 --> 42:40.566
They just go on and do it, so I have to act again. What 
did you do? Well, here's the company that one of his

42:43.090 --> 42:50.964
freshmen yesterday was turned in for, had food on 
him. They're standing here ready to go to some

42:52.246 --> 42:53.949
dinner. This captain is one of my finest friends, 
but he wasn't thin because I was captain You're

43:04.538 --> 43:12.891
going to stand here until you rot or fall out or I 
will fall out one because you're not going to move.

43:14.634 --> 43:19.962
You're not going to dinner today until that man 
steps out that made that freshman. I've got out an

43:19.982 --> 43:23.548
order that that's going to stop and now I'm 
stopping it. I'm going to find out in your outfit

43:25.030 --> 43:29.116
who made that freshman. Take that. I won't tell you 
what I'm going to do to him or what I'm going to do to

43:32.517 --> 43:36.723
him if you walk off. But you better not do it, boy." 
They stood there for 15 or 20 minutes. They got

43:43.011 --> 43:49.480
restless and pretty soon the singers got together 
and pretty soon the boy steps out. I said, now for

43:51.162 --> 43:55.808
goodness sake, isn't this a hell of a mess to have to 
go through this? Go on, eat your dinner, and I hope

43:56.328 --> 43:58.833
you have a good dinner. Hope you enjoy it. But damn, 
it had better not happen again. It didn't happen

44:04.023 --> 44:17.290
anymore, but they threatened to strike because 
they said he told us he would enforce our rounds if

44:04.023 --> 44:17.290
we would give the paddle up. I said, I didn't mean if 
you make him break the college regulation then you

44:19.717 --> 44:29.126
ought to be sensible enough to know that that 
wasn't included in that promise. But the

44:30.087 --> 44:33.850
president of the college called my attention to 
the fact that I had. The board of directors laughed

44:33.890 --> 44:41.577
at him sleeping out the train.

44:45.161 --> 44:48.964
Everybody that ever tried to do anything had 
nothing to do with him taking food out of the mess

44:49.349 --> 44:51.031
hall. Things are just in that shape. And the school 
not growing. And I'm not doing too well in my sport.

45:00.444 --> 45:02.687
And I've got a chance to do something for this 
college. I've never talked to anybody like this

45:03.568 --> 45:05.891
before. It's going to put it in print. I want you to 
put it in print. Oh, we will. Now listen, they've

45:13.421 --> 45:17.847
just got through naming that track for me down 
there. I know, I know. I'm the only coach that ever

45:19.775 --> 45:24.761
came here and never did quit and never was fired. 
And for that reason, they make me the first man that

45:25.582 --> 45:30.387
they take into the Hall of Fame. But they can fire me 
for making this talk.

45:36.795 --> 45:45.565
But if they do this all right with me, no, it 
wouldn't be all right with me, but I mean, I

45:36.795 --> 45:45.565
wouldn't change any part of

45:36.795 --> 45:45.565
it. Now, the captain of that team, No, tell me more 
about the Corps of Cadets. Let me say, we walked off

45:51.525 --> 45:55.360
with this team with my best wishes. Mm-hmm.
