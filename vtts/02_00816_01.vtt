00:05.566 --> 00:10.072
This is Allison Seal, and I'm in Terry Anderson's 
History Class 374. I'm interviewing today Mr.

00:11.013 --> 00:16.922
Plez Turner, who holds City Council Place 2 on the 
Bryan City Council.

00:21.248 --> 00:24.712
How long have you lived in Bryan? Since 1945. Where 
did you live before coming to Bryan? Well, I lived

00:29.699 --> 00:33.244
in Bradscott out in the rural area. Under what 
conditions did you leave? Well, I left and went

00:37.592 --> 00:38.774
into the service. And what service? Army. Army. 
Did you go to World War II and fought? Yes. Okay.

00:49.991 --> 00:51.473
When were you elected to the city council? April 7, 
1976. Okay.

00:56.401 --> 00:58.344
When was your first vote in a public election?

01:00.847 --> 01:02.590
Well, that man that must have been around. In the 
late 40s. In the late 40s? Okay. How old were you? In

01:12.040 --> 01:14.723
my early, in my mid-20s. Where did you vote? In 
Bryant? In Bryant, yes. Okay, what were, under

01:19.828 --> 01:25.874
what conditions were you, was there any kind of 
discrimination against you in voting? No, it was

01:26.094 --> 01:28.196
normal conditions. The only thing was you had to 
have a poll tax. Uh-huh. Okay, uh, In 1964, was

01:34.852 --> 01:43.143
there a freedom summer here, or were blacks always 
allowed to vote as long as they paid the poll tax?

01:43.183 --> 01:49.872
Well, they were always allowed to vote as far as I 
can remember as long as they paid the poll tax. Did

01:50.412 --> 01:52.956
you go to segregate or desegregate schools? 
Segregate schools. What about your children? He

01:56.680 --> 01:57.782
went to segregate school. And your 
grandchildren? They went to desegregate

02:00.105 --> 02:01.787
schools. When were the schools desegregated

02:03.421 --> 02:13.275
in

02:03.421 --> 02:13.275
Bryan? That, I don't remember. I don't know 
exactly when it was. It's been somewhere around 20

02:16.019 --> 02:21.627
something, 20 years ago I'd say. Okay. Were the 
schools equal as in separate but equal before

02:21.768 --> 02:25.733
desegregation? I don't think they were equal. 
They were separate and I don't think, I know they

02:28.417 --> 02:30.981
were not equal. Can you describe what you thought 
the differences were? Well, the difference that I

02:35.679 --> 02:45.494
had was that the black schools did not have the same 
curriculum as the white schools had. Since it was

02:45.514 --> 02:48.960
totaled with the white schools, it was not totaled 
with the black schools. Like what? Well, when I was

02:50.522 --> 02:56.211
going, it said just type it, or it was not totaled. 
Uh-huh. Sciences were taught with labs? Did they

02:58.855 --> 03:00.057
all have labs? It was a poorly equipped lab. How do 
you explain the lack of all due speed in the South to

03:05.534 --> 03:22.899
desegregate the schools after Brown versus 
education, which called for desegregation of

03:05.534 --> 03:22.899
separate but equal schools in 1954, but yet 
schools in Brown that I remember were not

03:05.534 --> 03:22.899
desegregated until 1970? Well, I think it just 
took took a while for it to trickle down. There was a

03:31.899 --> 03:45.973
lot of communities that, I mean, after the Supreme

03:31.899 --> 03:45.973
Court ruled to desegregate them, it took time for 
them to put into effect the plans. Then you kept

03:48.350 --> 03:52.496
having court battle after court battle, and 
people were waiting. One district was waiting on

03:52.656 --> 03:59.666
the other one to see what this court would rule, 
whether this was legal or not. And it just took a

03:59.686 --> 04:03.190
while for it, before it got down. What was the 
feeling among the black community of Bryan after

04:03.210 --> 04:07.396
that movement? I would say the feeling was mixed. I 
think the majority of the people held the

04:11.201 --> 04:18.171
movement, but some was a little comprehensive 
about it, a little worried about what it was going

04:18.758 --> 04:24.444
to be like. Did you feel like that the schools would 
in time be desegregated, or did you really not have

04:24.464 --> 04:32.031
much hope that they would be? I felt like they would 
eventually be surrogated,

04:32.052 --> 04:36.656
yes. How has the treatment of Blacks and Bryan 
changed from the 50s to the 80s, and why do you feel

04:36.676 --> 04:44.344
it's changed? Well, it has been some change. I 
guess the main change that I would say would be is

04:49.341 --> 04:57.390
that in the early 50s, everything was surrogate. 
You had two water fountains. You had two sets of

04:58.852 --> 05:01.154
restrooms. You had a cafe. You had two kinds, one 
for the blacks and one for the whites, you know,

05:03.497 --> 05:08.423
things of that nature. And that has changed, and I 
think you're being accepted more now than what you

05:08.963 --> 05:15.951
were.

05:19.087 --> 05:25.395
Which United States president do you think 
contributed the most to the civil rights

05:19.087 --> 05:25.395
movement? Well, that's a hard question. I would 
have to say Kennedy contributed the most, even

05:26.696 --> 05:31.402
though he didn't live very long. Johnson 
contributed equally, I'd say, but I think it was

05:31.462 --> 05:36.168
between those two presidents. One started, the 
other one finished it. How would you describe

05:39.993 --> 05:45.059
President Reagan's devotion to the civil rights 
on a scale of one to ten? One. And why is that? Well,

05:47.487 --> 05:55.038
every move President Reagan has made is to

05:47.487 --> 05:55.038
go back to discrimination. He has cut out the 
affirmative action program practically, and

05:55.058 --> 06:06.774
everything he can do in the legislature would be, 
it's contrary to the civil rights movement. What

06:06.794 --> 06:11.922
if any acts of discrimination did you experience? 
Oh, wait, you mean what I brought up? Yeah. Well,

06:14.425 --> 06:15.807
like I say, it was that When we were growing up, it 
was just two sets of everything. You could not go to

06:20.434 --> 06:21.975
the white schools. You could not go to the, you 
know, restaurant. You had to go around to a side

06:24.018 --> 06:26.661
door, a back door. Or if you go to get a drink, why do 
they have two fountains? And thanks to that,

06:30.225 --> 06:35.070
nature would discriminate against you. What were 
your feelings about the Freedom Rides in 1965 and

06:35.090 --> 06:40.957
the race riots and the bus boycotts? Well, I agreed 
with the Freedom Rides. I like the bus boycotts. I

06:47.573 --> 06:54.061
think that they did a lot of good, but for the race 
routes, I still don't think they did any good. They

06:54.081 --> 06:59.768
might have helped, but I can't see any. What do you 
think brought about the change from in the early

06:59.788 --> 07:14.346
60s, the bus boycotts and the freedom rides, you 
know, from a kind of nonviolent protest to then the

06:59.788 --> 07:14.346
black power movement in the late 60s? Well, I would 
say Martin Luther King did more for the change than

07:15.575 --> 07:22.282
any one man, a black man. That was what really 
brought about the change. But I think the time

07:27.809 --> 07:36.899
had just about caught up with it. See, we were freed 
over 100 years ago, but still we're not freed. And

07:40.883 --> 07:45.328
then it just kept chipping away and chipping away 
until we finally just got to the point What I was

07:46.355 --> 08:04.438
speaking of is in the early 1960s with Martin 
Luther King's nonviolent protest, eventually it

07:46.355 --> 08:04.438
changed to what brought about the race riots and 
things where there was black power movements and

07:46.355 --> 08:04.438
it was more a violent protest. Why do you think that 
changed? Well, I think that Martin Luther King, he

08:07.402 --> 08:12.548
had enough followers in him. People respect him 
enough that when he said nonviolent, they

08:13.388 --> 08:19.035
cooperated with him. Then after he passed along, 
there was no one else who had that much respect that

08:19.055 --> 08:27.605
they could say nonviolent and would have the power 
to keep it from happening. What happened in Bryan?

08:29.127 --> 08:32.671
Were there any protests or sit-ins or anything 
like that? It might have been some very minor

08:34.153 --> 08:38.458
sit-ins, not anything much, though. Some very 
minor, yeah, I think it was some minor sit-ins.

08:41.422 --> 08:41.522
Okay. What organizations such as NAACP and SCLC 
and SNCC were represented in Bryan? The NAACP, I

08:50.928 --> 08:53.872
think. Did you belong to any of the groups? I 
belonged to NAACP. What other black leaders

08:59.258 --> 09:02.301
besides Martin Luther King do you respect?

09:05.865 --> 09:09.970
Well, I respect Roy Wilkins. I think he was great. 
And I think Benjamin Hooks is a great black leader.

09:13.845 --> 09:19.351
Jesse Jackson is not a great black leader. What or 
to whom do you attribute the success of the

09:19.371 --> 09:27.238
Civil Rights Movement? You mean the person? Or, 
yeah.

09:34.726 --> 09:39.150
I would have to attribute it to Amanda the King.

09:40.210 --> 09:52.609
When you were elected to the city council, what was 
the voter turnout during the election, and what

09:40.210 --> 09:52.609
percent of white vote and what percent of black 
vote did you receive?

09:53.470 --> 09:54.692
Well, let's go back. If we review that first 
election, it was a good turnout at first because

09:54.792 --> 10:09.694
there were several of us running, but it was one 
black lady, myself, and Hispanic was in the race.

10:12.222 --> 10:22.296
The Hispanic and I got into a runoff, and the 410, I 
was re-elected at the end. I don't have the

10:22.316 --> 10:25.461
figures, though. If I'd have known enough 
questions, I guess we might have looked it up and

10:25.481 --> 10:33.231
got it, but it was very 19. I don't know. Okay. And 
what about the re-elections when you ran a

10:33.712 --> 10:37.217
campaign? Well, I've had one more runoff with a 
black lady that was a fairly light turnout. I think

10:53.605 --> 10:59.231
it was about 14% turnout at the end. But usually, 
all the races that I've been in, usually it would be

10:59.251 --> 11:06.259
about 20% turnout. When you were on the city 
council, did you experience any racism, racial

11:08.416 --> 11:16.107
jokes, etc.?

11:16.127 --> 11:16.187
No. Okay. There have been several terms used to 
describe blacks, such as colored in the 20s,

11:16.487 --> 11:22.615
Negroes in the 50s, and blacks in the 60s. Why do you 
feel those terms have changed? Just people come

11:25.379 --> 11:30.566
out with a different word that they want to use. 
What is your opinion of these terms? Do any of them

11:32.229 --> 11:33.310
offend you?

11:36.395 --> 11:45.004
Twenty-four percent of the soldiers killed in 
Vietnam were black, whereas blacks made up only 11

11:36.395 --> 11:45.004
percent of the U.S. society in the 60s. How would 
you explain the malaportia? Do you think that the

11:47.207 --> 11:49.289
blacks were drafted over whites? I don't have any 
figures on that. I know that a lot of whites were not

11:56.337 --> 11:59.881
drafted. I've read where a lot of them went to 
Canada and different places. But then too, during

12:04.627 --> 12:12.615
that time, prosperity was very, it wasn't what it 
should have been, I don't think. And a lot of the

12:12.635 --> 12:17.721
blacks volunteered for armed services before 
that. And a lot of them was caught in the fuck being

12:17.741 --> 12:25.328
that Vietnam War thing at the time. How do you feel 
black person's chances compared to white

12:25.349 --> 12:33.537
person's chances for social mobility are rising 
in the social status?

12:36.672 --> 12:42.381
I feel that it's considerably less chance. I think 
that if the black is one of the elite, the top

12:42.401 --> 12:50.513
person, then he can rise. But if he's an average, 
like the average white, he has a hard time making

12:51.434 --> 12:57.283
the move. What do you attribute that to? Well, it's 
still the same thing, that we want to take care of

12:59.687 --> 13:05.616
our own. As long as you have the white person who is 
in power who is doing the hiring and the promotion,

13:06.355 --> 13:19.107
well, he's going to take care of his

13:06.355 --> 13:19.107
own first. How would you rate the progress of 
blacks in society today in having attained their

13:19.127 --> 13:26.574
civil rights, just starting to almost there or 
complete?

13:29.137 --> 13:34.742
I'd say

13:29.137 --> 13:34.742
they're making progress, but it's It's a little 
slow, though. I don't say they're almost there. I

13:40.336 --> 13:44.582
guess they're about 25% there. What do you think 
would bring about complete change, complete

13:44.862 --> 13:51.272
progress, complete civil rights? Time. Had it not 
been for the efforts of Truman, Kennedy, and LBJ in

13:56.002 --> 14:12.065
attaining civil rights legislation and the 
Warren Court in upholding the legislation and

13:56.002 --> 14:12.065
setting new precedents for civil rights cases, as 
in Brown v. Board of Education, do you feel blacks

13:56.002 --> 14:12.065
today would have the rights they now possess? 
Well, I feel that had it not been for them, it would

14:14.649 --> 14:21.800
have been other men, other people that would have 
done the same thing. I think the time had just come

14:22.340 --> 14:25.485
and once if they happened to be the ones that was in 
office at that time. And I feel that after 100

14:32.982 --> 14:36.306
years, I think it would have made some progress. 
OK.

14:41.771 --> 14:48.018
I'm talking to Mr. Turner again on desegregation 
in Bryan School District. OK, Mr. Turner, you were

14:48.058 --> 14:52.502
talking about the differences in the 
desegregation as far as busing. Could you go on and

14:57.026 --> 14:58.427
tell me? Yes. If you notice that there's only one 
grade in the black neighborhood, which is the

15:00.269 --> 15:13.244
sixth grade, the Kemp College School. And when we 
look at that, we see that the white student is only

15:13.264 --> 15:22.675
bused out of his neighborhood one year out of the 12 
years to come into the minority area. into the

15:23.667 --> 15:26.711
black, predominantly black neighborhood. But 
when we reverse that, the black is busted out of his

15:26.731 --> 15:32.119
neighborhood. He's lumping out of the 12 years of 
high school. And that's going on right now? Yes,

15:36.125 --> 15:38.008
that's going on right now. And how long, what do you 
think will cause a change? Or do you think there

15:40.491 --> 15:42.995
will be a change in that? Well, on the time there 
will be a change, the pressure will be put into a

15:43.075 --> 15:49.945
change, I think. Okay, we were also talking about 
the schools, the black schools in Bryan compared

15:50.937 --> 16:01.534
to the white schools, and you were telling me about 
all the schools that were burnt down. Could you go

16:03.197 --> 16:07.824
through that again and tell me what schools they 
were and how often, when they were burnt down? The

16:07.964 --> 16:16.478
first school in Bryan was

16:07.964 --> 16:16.478
Washington College School. It was a historical 
mark. I don't

16:18.342 --> 16:39.030
know whether it's still there,

16:18.342 --> 16:39.030
because it was one of the historical schools. And 
that school burned down, which, back in the 20s,

16:39.050 --> 16:44.637
the blacks that would graduate, they would have on 
their diploma, brown-colored high school, or

16:39.050 --> 16:44.637
something to that effect. Then the next, that 
school burned down the next, not very, They had the

16:47.772 --> 17:03.755
junior high school in Brown, which previously was 
the high school in Brown before the Kemp was built,

16:47.772 --> 17:03.755
which was near the high school. In fact, that 
school was named Kemp High School until the other

17:03.915 --> 17:07.300
high school was built. And R.C. Neal was the 
principal there. He taught there for quite a few

17:10.403 --> 17:12.446
years. And after his passing, they named that 
school Neal High School and built a new high

17:12.546 --> 17:17.655
school. And they named it Neal Jr. High School and 
built a new high school and named it Kemp High

17:17.675 --> 17:24.007
School. And that school also burned down. Within 
how many years between the two? I don't think it was

17:30.449 --> 17:31.991
years. I think it was within months. I'm not part of 
that, but the record was shown. And then there was a

17:37.857 --> 17:40.640
third high school that burnt? No, just the two high 
schools, just the two schools that burnt. And what

17:44.584 --> 17:51.271
were the feelings among the black community as to 
how those schools burnt or why they were burnt?

17:51.351 --> 17:54.174
Well, it was a mixed feeling. They felt that it was, 
the black community felt that it was some

17:54.194 --> 17:58.178
obstinate in there. arson about white adults or 
white children? Well, they didn't, they never did

18:05.182 --> 18:11.090
come up with a specific who it was. It just felt like 
it was some arson in there. But I don't think they

18:13.574 --> 18:16.477
thought it was children. They thought it was white 
adults. I think we had another school to burn

18:18.040 --> 18:19.922
there, if I'm not mistaken. Did they tear that one 
down? If you go back quite a few years ago, on the

18:28.432 --> 18:30.775
side of the cellar. What was the name of that school 
there? What was it called? See, the Hispanic had

18:34.920 --> 18:37.503
school, too. They were equally surrogated. And I 
think that school burned down, too, if I'm not

18:39.385 --> 18:41.848
mistaken. Do you think the reason why they never 
figured out if it was arson or not is because they

18:41.908 --> 18:53.122
didn't really care and they didn't want to point a 
finger, since it's whites who would be doing the

18:41.908 --> 18:53.122
investigating, they didn't want to point fingers 
at whites? Well, I'd rather not comment on that,

18:53.782 --> 18:58.388
because I really don't know Okay. Yes, that school 
did burn down. So it's three schools that burned

19:04.335 --> 19:05.897
down. Because the Hispanic used to go to a school. 
In their neighborhood? Yes, it would rather be on

19:12.828 --> 19:18.116
Sandy Center and Luckin Street. Well, a little 
place around there was a Hispanic school. Were

19:21.401 --> 19:25.067
they segregated as far as fountains and restrooms 
too? I don't remember whether it was or whether it

19:27.781 --> 19:38.898
was not, but I know they were segregated as far as 
going to school. Okay. When these schools burnt

19:40.661 --> 19:44.907
down, around what time did that happen? During the 
immigration period. Did you ever know of any, did

19:48.312 --> 19:55.223
you ever travel through the South, or did you ever 
know of any or hear of any type of restrictions on

19:55.709 --> 19:59.735
blacks in other states? Well, I traveled through 
the South,

19:59.755 --> 20:22.806
must have

19:59.755 --> 20:22.806
been in 57 up until Alabama, and it was pretty bad 
then for black traveling. You couldn't, you could

20:22.826 --> 20:24.248
not find a hotel hard to see. It must

20:26.354 --> 20:38.889
have been in 64. It was in 64. We went to

20:40.470 --> 20:48.540
Cincinnati. We went to Arkansas. We couldn't find 
a decent place to live. Once we spent a night in

20:50.002 --> 20:51.563
Arkansas, we couldn't find a decent motel to live 
in. We carried Joe to back to Tuskegee at that time.

20:53.265 --> 20:54.267
We stopped at a cafe to eat and they waved us off. 
Yeah, that was in 57. You know, it wasn't a cafe, but

20:55.261 --> 21:03.333
it was something like a drive-in, a hot dog place. 
And they just keep going. What other things did you

21:08.360 --> 21:09.802
see? How was the black mood in those towns? Were 
they upset or were they just kind of so down? I don't

21:18.955 --> 21:21.419
think they were upset or anything. It was just... 
They had to endure it. They knew it until they got a

21:25.063 --> 21:27.587
chance. And when the chance came along, man, you 
know, it was improved. But back then, in those

21:33.156 --> 21:37.102
days, there was nothing they could do. If they were 
done

21:37.162 --> 21:44.674
with it, they would have been killed. How did Bryan 
compare to the other towns? Did Bryan have as much

21:49.058 --> 21:55.126
cruelty toward the blacks, or what do you think? 
Not as much as they had that envy of our deep

21:55.366 --> 22:04.900
southern states, such as Mississippi, Alabama, 
and those islands. Bryan wasn't as bad? No.

22:10.167 --> 22:15.454
How did the blacks' chances for employment in 
Bryan compare to those to a white person? without a

22:15.704 --> 22:19.409
college degree or with a college degree? I say it 
was slim because it was, blacks had passed exams

22:19.429 --> 22:41.317
before, but half of them, there was a fellow named 
Jim Parker Carroll was a postmaster at that time,

22:19.429 --> 22:41.317
and he hired me, and I was the first black carrier 
hired at the Bryant Post Office. The black person

22:41.337 --> 22:44.842
hired at the Bryant Post Office was a custodian, a 
janitor. What year was that? That's 1955.

22:49.641 --> 22:55.872
As far as for anyone else, what jobs were available 
to a black man in the 50s and 60s? Mostly janitorial

22:57.054 --> 22:58.536
work. If you had an education, teaching was about 
the only thing you could get. As far as

23:05.388 --> 23:10.416
salespersons, there was none. They were 
nonexistent for us blacks. In the banks back

23:14.022 --> 23:25.099
there, you had nothing but a custodian, a janitor, 
an air force, something of that nature. As far as

23:25.119 --> 23:28.945
being a teller or somewhere in the bookkeeping 
department, something of that nature.

23:41.193 --> 24:02.982
Like the pine trees lining the winding road I've 
got a name, I've got a name

23:41.193 --> 24:02.982
Like the singing bird and the croaking toad I've 
got a name, I've got a name And I carry it with me like

24:04.885 --> 24:09.852
my daddy did. But I'm living the dream that

24:09.932 --> 24:17.343
he kept here. Moving me down the highway. Moving me 
down the highway. Moving ahead so life won't pass

24:23.391 --> 24:26.556
me by.

24:31.970 --> 24:53.252
Like

24:31.970 --> 24:53.252
a north wind whistling down the sky I've got a song 
I've got a song Like a willful will and the baby's

24:31.970 --> 24:53.252
cry I've got a song I've got a song And

24:55.797 --> 25:14.226
I carry it with me and I sing it loud. If it gets me 
nowhere, I know they're proud. Moving me down the

25:15.147 --> 25:15.688
highway. Rolling me down the highway. Moving to 
hell till I won't pass the fire.

25:42.997 --> 26:09.308
And

25:42.997 --> 26:09.308
I'm gonna go there free Like a fool I am and I'll 
always be I've got a dream I've got a dream They can

25:42.997 --> 26:09.308
change their minds but they can't change me I've 
got a dream I've got a dream

26:12.545 --> 26:17.292
I know I could share it if you want me to. If you're 
going my way, I'll go with you. Bend me down the

26:24.263 --> 26:26.227
highway. Don't let me down the highway. One man 
ahead so life won't pass the by. Bend me down the

26:37.444 --> 26:37.945
highway.
