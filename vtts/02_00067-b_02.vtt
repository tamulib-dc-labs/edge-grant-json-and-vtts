WEBVTT

00:03.035 --> 00:06.219
I wasn't taking ROTC at the time. All right. 
Incidentally, when I finished A&M, I

00:08.942 --> 00:13.127
volunteered. I went to OCS, the Army, and my 
training as the ROTC helped me to get into OCS. So

00:27.304 --> 00:29.667
your A&M preparation... helped me to get into OCS. 
Now you graduated when? 8 a.m. 1938.

00:41.305 --> 00:42.326
Did you go to commencement?

00:45.049 --> 00:46.171
I don't really remember. Things like that were 
not... You don't remember who the speaker was? No.

00:50.535 --> 00:54.760
Do you remember when you got that ring? No. Well, I 
remember when I got this one, I lost the first one in

00:57.822 --> 01:01.706
New Guinea. Oh, did you? I was swimming in New 
Guinea, and it fell off in the Indian Ocean. Oh, my.

01:07.671 --> 01:12.336
And then I got this one while I was overseas. I 
bought another one. And incidentally, this ring

01:14.839 --> 01:18.762
only cost maybe $30. Do you remember what the first 
one cost? It wasn't over $30. wasn't much 25 30

01:24.980 --> 01:51.477
dollars as i remember what or maybe do you have any 
other ring stories you lost one in the indian ocean

01:24.980 --> 01:51.477
uh what about some others about somebody spotted 
your ring or something like that now that hasn't

01:24.980 --> 01:51.477
been found no but is was there times when somebody 
noticed your ring on your yes i took up tickets at

01:24.980 --> 01:51.477
the football games for thirty-some odd years. 
I've seen a lot of the spirit change there.

02:01.404 --> 02:09.793
Arkansas, I remember gung-ho they'd come in, and 
they were always a good crowd.

02:10.634 --> 02:18.882
The Texas crowd always came in when I was working on 
the gates, dressed up pretty real good. and even up

02:20.549 --> 02:40.760
until a few years back and even today I could go to 
the baseball game and you'd be surprised at the

02:20.549 --> 02:40.760
number of young Aggies, girls and all, will show 
you this old worn out ring and recognize it and

02:20.549 --> 02:40.760
introduce themselves or ask me what class I'm in 
and was in. And it's surprising how so many have

02:46.132 --> 02:51.984
really, over the years, these young people, 
recognized that ring. In OCS and later, what was it

02:53.728 --> 03:01.484
that you learned here that helped you? What was 
there about A&M that made a difference? Well,

03:07.310 --> 03:11.254
respect of authority, that's one thing. And

03:11.334 --> 03:23.187
understanding the principles of drilling and 
commands. And respecting authority is one of the

03:24.709 --> 03:33.999
biggest things I think I learned. And to do what 
you're told to do. What is Aggie spirit?

03:45.689 --> 03:47.411
Well, I saw that one time. I was on a boat going up to

03:47.531 --> 03:56.800
Tokyo, Yokohama. We had left the Philippines, and 
I was with a young man, a fellow, and he had

03:56.820 --> 04:06.730
graduated from some military school in Virginia, 
I believe, somewhere. And he had gone into a class.

04:11.644 --> 04:24.505
See, at that time then they were bringing in Aggies 
from ROTC that had a commission, but they were

04:11.644 --> 04:24.505
making them go into another, what, refresher 
course. And if they didn't pass that refresher

04:24.825 --> 04:29.292
course, they didn't keep them on duty. And he had 
learned every Aggie yell, even though he was with a

04:31.246 --> 04:38.035
bunch of Aggies. He had learned every Aggie yell 
and learned that. However, he did say this, that

04:43.982 --> 04:58.941
they had one or two Aggies that were a little bit 
hanging back, and he said they could have really

04:43.982 --> 04:58.941
carried them through, but they didn't do it. He 
said he was somewhat surprised that they let them

04:59.410 --> 05:06.058
drop out.

05:09.942 --> 05:11.384
I remember him saying that. I remember over in New 
Guinea, though, there was an old colonel in charge

05:12.665 --> 05:18.112
of the Air Force. We had a,

05:18.132 --> 05:28.624
we sent a plane down to Australia and we got some a 
keg of beer and some chickens. And we had the Aggie,

05:33.087 --> 05:39.995
what do they call it, reunion? Mustard. Mustard. 
We had that in New Guinea there one time. And there

05:45.102 --> 05:51.109
were a bunch of Aggies there in New Guinea at the 
time. Was that a meaningful experience? Well, it

05:55.315 --> 05:55.975
was. This old colonel that I knew, And we got a bunch 
of Aggies there together and had a monster there.

06:02.875 --> 06:10.488
And he'd let us send a plane down to, I wasn't in, I 
was attached to that unit. I wasn't in the Air

06:10.709 --> 06:12.893
Force. And send a plane down to Australia and get a 
keg of beer. some barbecued chickens now, that was

06:17.457 --> 06:22.702
a treat. And we got a bunch of aggies and had a nice 
muster. Do you remember going to muster when you

06:25.824 --> 06:28.907
were a student? No, I don't. I haven't found many 
people that remember muster before World War II.

06:34.732 --> 06:38.315
The only one I actually remember was when I was in 
New Guinea. What are the qualities of being an

06:39.976 --> 06:42.599
aggie? What's special about an aggie?

06:51.865 --> 07:14.802
Well, as I remember

06:51.865 --> 07:14.802
there, we were with each other and respected each 
other and trusted each other and

06:51.865 --> 07:14.802
felt like that our other Aggie

07:17.228 --> 07:25.960
would be there to help us or whatnot.

07:26.201 --> 07:42.283
And

07:26.201 --> 07:42.283
most of us at that time, you might say, understood 
and respected where these others came from, that

07:26.201 --> 07:42.283
they were poor boys, too. See, any one I think that 
was a feeling that had maybe perhaps is different

07:47.992 --> 07:53.018
from today. We all knew the backgrounds of these 
people, what a lot of them did to be able to come to

07:53.719 --> 08:06.433
A&M, which drew us very well together.

08:09.056 --> 08:16.885
And there wasn't anybody, you might say, football 
players or anybody that was any more than somebody

08:09.056 --> 08:16.885
else. And it didn't matter where you came from or 
who your father was? That's right. And of course we

08:24.253 --> 08:26.697
didn't have any politics. That wasn't the 
internet to any of

08:27.838 --> 08:33.887
us. What have we left out that we should have 
covered?

08:40.196 --> 08:41.358
Well, I don't know. I

08:41.378 --> 08:45.724
can't

08:55.627 --> 08:56.388
Well, let's see. When I finished A&M,

08:57.730 --> 09:10.147
until I got this job in New Orleans, I went down to 
Houston to try to see about getting a job. Jobs were

09:11.649 --> 09:15.715
very hard to get, very hard. There was a green 
company down there, Archer I'm thinking,

09:27.065 --> 09:36.178
I would have been able to get a job there, but they 
called me in and said, we don't care whether you

09:27.065 --> 09:36.178
graduated from college or not. And that was the 
general attitude.

09:43.347 --> 09:45.470
They said, no, but we'll let you get a job. We'll put 
you on the dock out here. load and unload and feed

09:48.850 --> 10:00.221
and drain, and we'll see how you turn out.

10:00.241 --> 10:16.917
Also, I had a chance, possibly, of getting a job 
with a concrete company in Houston

10:00.241 --> 10:16.917
as a clerk or something like that.

10:19.208 --> 10:32.464
And I almost had another chance of getting a job, I 
believe it was with Guff Refining Company in the

10:19.208 --> 10:32.464
accounting department, since I had some 
accounting at A&M. But that wasn't very

10:33.906 --> 10:46.701
promising, and

10:33.906 --> 10:46.701
I ended up getting this job in New Orleans with 
American Cotton Co-op as a cotton class. I was what

10:47.558 --> 10:49.961
they called a squidge, as I remember. I had to work 
as a squidge or an apprentice until later. But I

10:56.870 --> 10:59.974
worked there in the classroom rooms there in New 
Orleans. Made seventy-five dollars a month and

11:01.196 --> 11:08.485
lived there, and I live down in New Orleans now for 
ten thousand. I lost my job when they put the

11:08.505 --> 11:11.389
twelve-cent loan on.

11:14.677 --> 11:18.922
Let's see, I'm near the end of the questions. I can 
think I've got three or four. Let's make believe

11:23.007 --> 11:32.859
that someone comes up and gives you a check for a 
million dollars today and there is one

11:23.007 --> 11:32.859
restriction on that check. You must pass it on to 
Texas A&M but you get to decide what the money would

11:33.880 --> 11:40.228
be used for. In other words, if you could make a big 
contribution to A&M, what would you want it to do?

11:50.030 --> 11:54.235
I believe mostly it would be for scholarship, not 
research. Scholarships for whom? What kind of

11:58.218 --> 11:59.099
students? Well, I try to make it for

12:01.522 --> 12:09.169
students who Not financially, but go to A&M. How 
would you select the most deserving ones?

12:25.025 --> 12:26.807
I haven't given that a whole lot of thought.

12:29.831 --> 12:31.032
Could they major in anything? Would it matter? No, 
it wouldn't matter because I found that The more

12:39.018 --> 12:55.284
you continue to learn throughout life, and 
regardless of what you take, in other words, it's a

12:39.018 --> 12:55.284
good idea to get an overall

12:39.018 --> 12:55.284
thing done. All right, next to the last question. 
What did it mean to your life that you went to Texas

12:58.269 --> 13:02.376
A&M?

13:06.052 --> 13:14.324
Well, I've always been proud of the college and 
that I could, I think it's helped me a whole lot. It

13:14.864 --> 13:15.425
helped me.

13:22.775 --> 13:25.419
I haven't been real successful in making a whole 
lot of money. However, I'm financially stable

13:26.200 --> 13:31.047
now.

13:34.300 --> 13:48.613
I think I learned something way back there when I 
went to A&M

13:34.300 --> 13:48.613
that I wouldn't have gotten at some other school.

13:48.633 --> 13:51.836
What feelings do you have in your heart for A&M 
today?

13:55.580 --> 14:02.646
Well, today I think, for instance, I went to the 
baseball game the other day. I had hard season for

14:04.490 --> 14:05.712
them. And I just love A&M, particularly now the 
baseball.

14:15.067 --> 14:27.747
I feel fortunate that I can go to baseball games at 
A&M, in preference to pro games down in Houston or

14:15.067 --> 14:27.747
Dallas, and I I like to see it because I think that 
those boys are playing there for the love of A&M. A

14:33.569 --> 14:39.940
lot of them know they're not going to be 
professionals, but they're playing and it'll

14:33.569 --> 14:39.940
help them later in life.

14:44.147 --> 14:51.760
I don't care to see some of the

14:44.147 --> 14:51.760
research that's going on in A&M now. And I don't 
like particularly sometimes they have some

14:52.837 --> 14:59.263
professors I've heard that some of the students 
don't understand. Sometimes,

14:59.303 --> 15:09.613
of course, the classes are larger, but we've got to 
accept that. I

15:12.256 --> 15:21.645
can't say I could carry the love for Antium now as I 
did back there when it was a college. I feel

15:22.942 --> 15:33.024
fortunate, and I wouldn't mind going through it 
again. I wouldn't change it. I'm glad.

15:41.262 --> 15:42.064
I'm happy about it. all right now that's the end of 
the real interview but I'm worried that we didn't

15:43.630 --> 16:12.017
get that first part I'm worried about our machine 
so let's go back and you again please summarize

15:43.630 --> 16:12.017
growing up where you were born your family and that 
that first five minutes or so that you did this

15:43.630 --> 16:12.017
morning okay where were you born what'd your 
family do where'd they come from that sort of thing

15:43.630 --> 16:12.017
where'd y'all live Well, I was born somewhere 
around College Station on September 22, 1913.

16:22.506 --> 16:41.903
My mother was the daughter of W.C. Boyd,

16:22.506 --> 16:41.903
lived at College Station, and he lived, he built a 
home there located where the campus theater is

16:22.506 --> 16:41.903
now.

16:42.676 --> 16:46.680
I was born, I didn't, there was no birth 
certificate when I was born. Later in my life, when

16:47.941 --> 16:54.566
I went in the Army, my mother had to fix a birth 
certificate up for me. I moved to San Antonio when I

16:56.468 --> 17:11.181
was very young, and then moved back to College 
Station when I was about eight years old, and my

16:56.468 --> 17:11.181
mother had a house across from my grandfather 
which is, my grandfather lived, as I say, in the

17:12.308 --> 17:17.835
home he built while the campus here is.

17:21.999 --> 17:28.007
And I went to Consolidated School, the old band 
hall on the campus. I had to walk from my house over

17:29.368 --> 17:37.658
across the campus, and I remember going across the 
drill field all of the That's

17:38.971 --> 17:44.556
where I graduated from in 1931. And how

17:44.617 --> 17:50.042
many in your class? You think 15? It might have been 
15, possibly 20 at the most, I think. And campus and

18:01.853 --> 18:04.716
country? What's that? Both. Consolidated school 
was composed of what we called the campus kids and

18:07.945 --> 18:15.637
the off-campus kids. I was an off-campus kid. And 
the country kids. The country kids came from

18:23.248 --> 18:29.297
around maybe Welborn and out at Rock Prairie. And 
the buses carried those kids back and forth. The

18:35.126 --> 18:36.568
rest of us had to walk school. which was no problem. 
And some of the key teachers at the school that you

18:42.552 --> 18:45.999
remember? I remember we had a principal came named 
Gross. He took several of us one time over to

18:50.988 --> 18:54.213
Huntsville. I don't know what for. Also, I had a 
teacher,

19:02.688 --> 19:09.776
Mrs. Burgess, which was the wife of Herschel 
Burgess, and Mrs. Burgess was the daughter of Dr.

19:02.688 --> 19:09.776
T.O. Walton, and she taught English, I think it 
was, or some courses there at Consolidated

19:09.796 --> 19:18.066
School. I liked her very much, of course. Also, 
there was a Mrs. Dokes at Consolidated School, and

19:22.831 --> 19:30.180
she was very well liked. Matter of fact, we liked 
all of our teachers really. There was no teacher

19:34.494 --> 19:37.198
that I knew of that we didn't like.

19:43.028 --> 19:47.095
I told you about A&M about Mr. Snuggs. You got that, 
haven't you? I think we got it. I believe now we're

19:49.098 --> 19:50.380
caught up.
