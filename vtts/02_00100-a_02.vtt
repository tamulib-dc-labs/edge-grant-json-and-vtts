WEBVTT

00:02.107 --> 00:04.630
arm of Boyd Page at that time. He was right across 
from the president's office in Coke. In Coke. Now,

00:09.256 --> 00:14.462
did you, was there a dean of the college appointed 
then, or did you? No. As I probably kind of

00:15.643 --> 00:26.116
caustically said in this thing I wrote up, Rutter 
had me doing two and three jobs for the price of one

00:15.643 --> 00:26.116
all through my tenure under it. No, he, I was I 
didn't even have the title of acting dean. I was the

00:31.188 --> 00:32.409
dean of the college. I was running A&M for him. 
Because when I first knew who you were, you were

00:35.353 --> 00:41.401
vice president for academic affairs and? Dean of 
the graduate college, yeah. But that came later. I

00:45.787 --> 00:55.941
never, in fact, I was trying to talk him into hiring 
somebody to direct and coordinate research, and

00:45.787 --> 00:55.941
he said, okay, Hall, add that to your title.

00:58.115 --> 01:05.442
And in those days, generally summarize what your 
responsibilities were. My responsibility was to

01:07.666 --> 01:19.161
do anything that Earl Rudder asked me to do, and he 
expected me to run the academic ship, and that was

01:07.666 --> 01:19.161
it, which included student relations. In the 
early days, we didn't have a dean of students until

01:19.221 --> 01:27.831
Hannigan was hired to replace him, to replace 
Benny Zinn, that had been dean of students. There

01:28.172 --> 01:32.998
were four school deans then? Well, I can name one. 
There were agriculture, arts and sciences,

01:34.780 --> 01:48.253
engineering,

01:34.780 --> 01:48.253
veterinary medicine, and education came later 
after Rutter was president. So there were four.

01:50.535 --> 01:57.322
And when I get here in 59, Frank Hubert had just been 
hired. To be dean. And Benson was. Dean of

02:00.745 --> 02:02.327
engineering. Gus Watkins, and Al Price. Al Price 
was veterinary medicine. Let's see. Am I leaving

02:11.399 --> 02:12.521
out something? No, those are the four. No, that was 
it, because I immediately talked Rutter into

02:13.282 --> 02:24.958
reorganizing the whole campus, and that's when we 
established the new colleges, like science and

02:13.282 --> 02:24.958
geoscience and et cetera. In fact, they're all 
there now. What was a routine week for you? and the

02:30.185 --> 02:32.228
way Mr. Rudder related to you and the other key 
administrators. Did you all have a weekly

02:37.196 --> 02:41.542
administrators staff meeting? No, we didn't have 
any formal staff meetings, but in the early days

02:42.564 --> 02:47.772
right after he came, He would call, have a meeting 
with Dorsey and me every evening after the others

02:47.752 --> 02:53.741
had gone home. We'd stay there until we had hashed 
out whatever he wanted done. Sometimes it would

02:58.569 --> 03:06.722
run to 9 to 9.30 at night, even though many of us had 
never eaten lunch that day.

03:06.888 --> 03:09.110
No, he was a hard worker himself. In the early days, 
he would be there early in the morning and stay

03:09.310 --> 03:17.119
there late at night, except when he was out of town 
on business, university or other business. Was he

03:17.359 --> 03:18.300
a good listener? I would say he was, yeah. He would 
listen to people he trusted, I'll put it that way.

03:25.627 --> 03:27.429
And I'm not going to ask the negative on this one. 
Who were those you think he trusted most? Well, in

03:31.573 --> 03:35.157
the early days, only two people, Dorsey McCrory 
and myself. He didn't trust the Deans. He wanted me

03:38.508 --> 03:43.174
to interact with them and get the things done, 
which I did, of course. And he didn't react

03:43.335 --> 03:50.183
pleasantly to someone that tried to go around the 
chain of command, did he? No, sir. Everything was

03:52.667 --> 03:54.749
formal with him. You had to have appointments, and 
you didn't meet around the bush with him at all.

04:04.297 --> 04:11.961
Where as you first began to settle into that task, 
were there some immediate problems that you felt

04:04.297 --> 04:11.961
you had to deal with? Well, the main thing was 
trying to get the existing organization schools

04:13.814 --> 04:26.654
and so forth on a better basis, which we did, and 
start hiring and assisting. We hire better

04:26.754 --> 04:32.904
faculty, particularly those for the research 
vent, which I insisted upon, Mr. Rudder endorsed.

04:34.486 --> 04:42.178
Essentially,

04:34.486 --> 04:42.178
the only research that was taking place in the 
early days was in agriculture. Even engineering

04:42.558 --> 04:45.723
wasn't conducting any research to mount 
anything. I convinced Mr. Rutter that we should

04:46.744 --> 05:02.468
model the entire research effort after 
agriculture with joint appointments, teaching

04:46.744 --> 05:02.468
and research, even in arts and sciences, although 
that was the last one to follow that route. The

05:04.220 --> 05:08.467
appointment of Frank Hubert was important to me. 
He had been my seventh grade band director and my

05:08.908 --> 05:12.153
12th grade principal. Yeah. How did he get 
identified to be the new dean of arts and sciences?

05:18.202 --> 05:18.703
This way. He was a well-known college, I mean, high 
school superintendent. I believe he was at

05:23.130 --> 05:25.334
Beaumont when he was hired. Orange. Orange, 
you're right. Yeah, Orange. You're right. Yeah,

05:28.799 --> 05:31.003
that's right.

05:33.785 --> 05:37.470
He was hired primarily because he was a well-known 
educator. And he knew Earl Rudder. That's another

05:38.571 --> 05:40.654
reason. I think they had overlapped in Austin. Was 
that it? Because Hubert had been the number two man

05:43.718 --> 05:49.405
in the State Department of Education before going 
back to Orange. Oh, you're right. You're right.

05:50.887 --> 05:51.928
And I think. Yeah. Did you identify him, or did 
Rutter, or do you remember? No, I had nothing to do

05:56.478 --> 06:00.428
with the initial appointment of Frank Herbert. 
Rutter handled it entirely. And I endorsed it. I

06:06.353 --> 06:19.089
did convince him to establish a college of 
education school initially and to let Hubert

06:06.353 --> 06:19.089
decide whether we wanted to be dean of arts and 
sciences or of education. And initially he took

06:19.950 --> 06:27.939
arts and sciences, but later when we split it off to 
education, he took that helm.

06:30.242 --> 06:34.167
Staying with Mr. Rutter, normally he was... there 
on campus all day, five days a week? When he wasn't

06:42.453 --> 06:46.840
involved in some other activity, yeah. That was in 
the early days. Later, I hesitate to say this, but

06:49.464 --> 06:56.715
his health deteriorated badly and most people 
weren't aware of this. No, I was not aware of that.

06:58.338 --> 07:01.723
He was absent a lot from the office. And about three 
or four years after he was president, he spent over

07:01.703 --> 07:10.056
a month over at the O'Brien Hospital. And I used to 
go over there every morning and spend an hour or so

07:10.696 --> 07:17.927
discussing everything and getting his blessing 
on actions that needed. What were his key concerns

07:19.490 --> 07:23.496
as a decision maker?

07:26.680 --> 07:29.044
Did he have any pet peeves and pet joys? Well, he 
liked action. He didn't like people that would

07:33.099 --> 07:37.845
dilly-dally around and not just bring something 
to fruition. And he wanted it done in a hurry. And I

07:41.870 --> 07:45.795
presume he probably didn't like theory as much as 
he liked reality. No, he liked practicality, yes.

07:49.339 --> 08:01.174
He wasn't adverse to theory as long as it tied into 
the objective that we... Now, by 1962, A&M was

07:49.339 --> 08:01.174
blessed by his friendship with John Connolly. And 
I presume that we were helped in Austin by that

08:01.407 --> 08:09.095
relationship? Oh, yeah, very much so. Connolly 
was a strong supporter of A&M behind the scenes,

08:11.597 --> 08:17.183
even though he was a UT graduate. But, I mean, he was 
behind the scenes. He was supporting A&M. Oh,

08:21.107 --> 08:23.630
yeah, he and Rutter were great friends. Probably 
you may remember in the book I mentioned that the

08:24.330 --> 08:29.255
surprise meeting, we were coming back from 
Junction. He didn't tell me until we were Leaving

08:31.377 --> 08:35.109
his place, his ranch, we stopped at his ranch on the 
way back. And he said, we got a meeting I got to

08:36.374 --> 08:38.581
attend.

08:41.611 --> 08:43.497
And we stopped at Waco.

08:46.143 --> 08:52.470
To my surprise, the people he was meeting was John 
Connolly and LBJ and their staff.

08:55.352 --> 09:01.118
I said, Mr. Rutter, maybe I better just stay at the 
bar or go get something to eat or do something. He

09:01.379 --> 09:02.460
said, no, you come in there. He said, get you 
something to eat. Keep your damn mouth shut. Just

09:07.105 --> 09:08.366
listen. That's what I did. Now, did Mr. Rutter have 
a good sense of humor? Yeah, surprisingly he did.

09:15.252 --> 09:17.274
He didn't display it too often, but he did. And 
let's see, food. Did he have special foods he

09:20.458 --> 09:22.581
enjoyed? Well, I don't know if you can call that a 
typical Texan, but he liked the fiery Mexican

09:22.621 --> 09:29.689
foods. In fact, even though he had stomach ulcers, 
he used to get on me because, Mr. Rutter, why in the

09:31.211 --> 09:40.622
hell do you eat that fiery stuff? It's burning your 
stomach up. He said, Little hot stuff good for you.

09:50.069 --> 09:58.338
One of the key things that I hope you can recall for 
me is the Aspirations Report and all of those

09:50.069 --> 09:58.338
studies. Do you know who came up with the idea that 
we have a study of what A&M might become in 1976?

10:09.100 --> 10:13.833
Well, I'd like to take credit for it, although I'm 
sure there's a number of different inputs. The

10:13.933 --> 10:21.152
Association of Former Students claim that they 
had a strong influence, and I guess they did have

10:13.933 --> 10:21.152
some effect. I convinced Mr. Rutter we were 
supposed to do the Southern Association

10:21.487 --> 10:28.684
accreditation in the coming year. I said, Mr. 
Rutter, as long as we're doing this, and Dorsey and

10:29.346 --> 10:39.630
I had talked it over with Rutter at great length, 
why don't we do our own study, what we want to

10:29.346 --> 10:39.630
become? because we got to do all most of this anyway 
for the self-study and we got the people appointed

10:39.610 --> 11:07.744
and so forth we'll just select a few and do it and we 
did now uh as you recall i became the secretary of

10:39.610 --> 11:07.744
the aspirations committee and we met for many 
months and i think most of us on that committee were

10:39.610 --> 11:07.744
dumbfounded on the day that we voted unanimously 
for all of those tradition-shattering changes.

11:12.449 --> 11:40.549
uh were you and mr rutter and other key 
administrators surprised when our committee

11:12.449 --> 11:40.549
turned in the report at the recommendations i 
wasn't i think mr rutter was initially in fact a

11:12.449 --> 11:40.549
certain part of it he wasn't going to endorse at all 
until i convinced him that he would be in the best

11:12.449 --> 11:40.549
interest to do it all right as i remember the 
conversation with you one day you gave me uh... one

11:41.120 --> 12:10.772
of the first draft copies which mister rudder had 
annotated questions so forth and you ask me to

11:41.120 --> 12:10.772
review it redrafted bring in and uh... i went back 
and said to you and said that he in the number of

11:41.120 --> 12:10.772
instances was questioning the committee's 
subjective judgment and that we really believed

11:41.120 --> 12:10.772
it and that therefore couldn't undo that and uh... 
as i recall you said i'll state my job on the

12:10.870 --> 12:19.220
committee's right to, all right, what was Mr. 
Rutter's reaction when the final report wasn't

12:10.870 --> 12:19.220
changed? Well, initially he was opposed to 
certain parts of it, but it took Dorsey McCrory and

12:20.702 --> 12:32.597
myself several months to convince him that we 
should go ahead with it. I think some of the outside

12:33.258 --> 12:39.105
influences also impinged on Mr. Rutter's 
decision. As I have looked at it, I thought we had

12:40.233 --> 12:43.599
Bill Moore for it. Bill Moore was one that was 
endorsing it and telling him he would push it in the

12:43.619 --> 12:48.728
legislature. John Connolly, behind the scenes, 
was doing it. And the Washington LBJ. Ed Cooper

12:56.862 --> 13:01.009
told me in the interview with him But in 
retrospect, he believed that there had been a

13:00.989 --> 13:09.366
conversation at the White House when LBJ told him 
you've got to do it. There was. The former

13:10.448 --> 13:12.211
representative from here. Teague. Yeah. He and 
Rutter were cut from the same cloth. Oh, yes, yes. I

13:18.404 --> 13:27.217
shouldn't tell you this, but when he used to come 
down here to visit, Rutter would invite me over to

13:18.404 --> 13:27.217
the president's house and over drinks. He would 
ask me to key him in on several things that he and I

13:27.778 --> 13:36.531
wanted to do and we had underway and so forth. And 
they would kid each other. You'd think they hated

13:38.794 --> 13:44.480
each other's guts to hear them talk, but that 
really wasn't the case. They were blood brothers.

13:46.182 --> 13:49.506
And then Jake Pickle, the Austin representative, 
went way back. I don't know much about Pickle's

13:49.586 --> 13:51.509
influence. I think it came later in the game. But 
they were old, positive friends. Now, you need to

13:55.633 --> 13:57.175
leave when? No, no, not right now. I've got a bad 
case of kidneys. I've got to go. Oh, all right,

14:01.160 --> 14:02.381
unplug. Oh, that's right. As long as we were 
talking, is it on now? Yes. Talking about Earl

14:07.587 --> 14:10.510
Rudder, I'd like to make a few comments. Most 
people on the campus were scared to death of Earl

14:11.411 --> 14:14.554
Rudder. In some cases, they had good reasons for 
it. But the reason he and I got along and he knew from

14:20.840 --> 14:27.107
the start that I wasn't afraid of him a bit. I would 
stand up to him and talk to him, and he respected me

14:27.307 --> 14:30.950
for it. And we got along very well as a result. And he 
never did... Well, he got angry a couple times with

14:37.463 --> 14:45.591
me, but he never did really blast me like I've seen 
him blast some of the faculty and other deans and so

14:37.463 --> 14:45.591
forth. And the result, a lot of them hated his guts, 
just to be blunt about it. Now, I heard through the

14:50.456 --> 14:54.440
grapevine that he had a high respect for Fred 
Benson. Is that? He did, and I did, too. Fred and I

14:56.322 --> 14:59.065
got along about as well as any of the deans. Al Price 
was an excellent dean, too. Al was sort of quiet and

15:02.248 --> 15:07.453
unassuming, but he got the job done. Because I 
heard a version of his one day fussing at the deans.

15:14.993 --> 15:23.566
maybe that's too weak a word, about that 
aspirations report and that Benson said, Mr.

15:14.993 --> 15:23.566
President, you ask them for their 
recommendations. If you didn't want to hear what

15:24.067 --> 15:27.132
they had to recommend, you shouldn't ask them. 
He's entirely correct. Fred wasn't afraid of Mr.

15:28.574 --> 15:30.797
Rutter either. That's the reason that Earl and 
Fred got along well, too. Because you never show

15:35.444 --> 15:40.752
any fear of Mr. Rutter because he'd be right on you. 
Of those changes... non-compulsory core,

15:43.158 --> 15:53.213
co-education, was Mr. Rutter more concerned 
about one of those than the other? Initially, he

15:53.253 --> 15:56.637
was opposed to all three. The least was changing 
the name of college to university. But even that,

16:02.987 --> 16:07.393
it took us a long time of argument with him to get him 
convinced about it. The last I think that he

16:08.082 --> 16:11.407
capitulated on was women. But he gave in. And with 
all of these important people being supportive,

16:15.172 --> 16:27.390
one day in 1970, not long before he went to the 
hospital, I was over there begging for money for

16:15.172 --> 16:27.390
the library. And I got him to smile because I said, 
Mr. Rutter, they couldn't say you weren't a Texan,

16:28.096 --> 16:41.589
you weren't an Aggie, you hadn't served the 
country, that you were one of these fuddy-duddy

16:28.096 --> 16:41.589
PhDs that were just here passing through. And he 
grinned and he said, oh, I never thought of any of

16:41.610 --> 16:45.058
that. And I said, oh, I'm sure you didn't. Yeah, 
well.

16:52.093 --> 17:00.330
No, he and I, and Dorsey, and not always, sometimes 
just the two of us, would hassle these things out at

16:52.093 --> 17:00.330
great length. It took me a long time to convince him 
that this was for the good of A&M. He told me also in

17:07.197 --> 17:17.340
that same session in 1970, he said, if your 
committee had recommended the name that LSU has,

17:18.400 --> 17:19.482
It would have gotten through. And I said, what do 
you mean? And he said, the official name of the

17:20.603 --> 17:28.375
school in Baton Rouge is Louisiana State 
University and Agricultural and Mechanical

17:20.603 --> 17:28.375
College. That's true. Still is. And he said, that 
way, us old-timers could have called ourselves

17:29.596 --> 17:34.103
Aggies and talked about A&M. And he said, then you 
young kids could have talked about Texas State. I

17:38.590 --> 17:41.674
now see his point very clearly. uh it was it was a 
surprise to me uh then yeah he did argue for that he

17:41.654 --> 18:03.105
didn't like a and m he says you're going to put 
periods after a and after him i said no it's just

17:41.654 --> 18:03.105
carrying over the old tradition of the 
agricultural mechanical without spelling it out

17:41.654 --> 18:03.105
just saying it's the a and m Texas A&M University. 
It took him a long time. Yeah, he did bring up about

18:07.779 --> 18:10.563
LSU's name. Now the board members,

18:11.103 --> 18:20.114
I know you mentioned some of them a while ago during 
that era. Sterling Evans and Boydle and I presume

18:20.134 --> 18:26.342
Al Davies and...

18:27.588 --> 18:33.819
Oh, the former Southwestern Bell president. The 
board

18:34.941 --> 18:40.431
came along with it? No, not all of the old Aggies 
that were on the board were in favor of it, but they

18:41.473 --> 18:47.284
finally went with it because they had political 
pressure from other places put on, too. And I know

18:52.944 --> 18:58.101
the former students, John Lindsay and- John 
Lindsay was- He wasn't on the board at that time,

18:59.752 --> 19:03.458
but he came on the board later. He was president of 
the former students when they endorsed him.

19:07.224 --> 19:07.725
You're right. I remember that now. I'm trying to 
think. Jimmy Aston from Dallas was in that era.

19:17.881 --> 19:19.083
Oh, there's a couple of others. In the 60s, did you 
feel we were making progress? Yeah, we were making

19:28.760 --> 19:32.066
great progress academically. I thought so. Oh, 
yeah.

19:38.056 --> 19:44.608
I thought we were making better progress than we 
were in some of the administrative areas. No, I

19:44.588 --> 19:47.651
thought we made great progress. In fact, I think it 
set the real solid foundation for what happened

19:47.731 --> 19:57.521
under your friend and mine, Jack, later. Let's go 
on. You said, Mr. Rutter, you were aware of his

20:00.865 --> 20:08.893
declining health because you saw him regularly 
and so forth. Were there times that, in fact, you

20:09.974 --> 20:14.359
and others had to make decisions and then relay the 
action to Mr. Rutter? Not too often, only it would

20:25.057 --> 20:27.722
be a rare occasion. I usually check with Mr. Rutter 
about any major decision because I knew the way

20:28.022 --> 20:34.373
that he reacted. Now, let's see. He brought in Dean 
of Students... Hannigan. Hannigan. Yeah, Jim

20:43.990 --> 20:44.772
Hannigan. And he came about not long after you 
became the Chief Academic Officer. Yeah, he was

20:50.945 --> 20:52.328
the...

20:55.970 --> 21:01.636
Well, after Benny Zinn, the things just sort of, 
student relations just sort of vacillated. In

21:02.097 --> 21:06.621
fact, Mr. Rutter handled a lot of the student 
relations himself in the early days. He delighted

21:06.641 --> 21:13.188
doing that more than making major decisions. 
Wouldn't he have enjoyed being the commandant of

21:13.549 --> 21:16.412
the Corps? Oh, yeah. He would have enjoyed that 
thoroughly. Now, I have the impression that Mr.

21:19.295 --> 21:24.120
Rutter worked a lot, long hours, but almost never 
took any of his frustrations and joys home. No, and

21:31.210 --> 21:35.556
you can confirm this with Margaret if you ever talk 
with her. Margaret knew less about what was going

21:36.577 --> 21:48.454
on at A&M than almost any of the wives because he 
never took, he would not discuss business at the

21:36.577 --> 21:48.454
university or college in the early days with her. 
She'll tell you that. She's praised me. She says,

21:51.848 --> 21:54.791
you knew my husband better than I did. And I asked 
Ann Rutter that question. And what were his, as you

21:59.075 --> 22:05.942
remember the table conversation or anything at 
home, what were his greatest joys and

21:59.075 --> 22:05.942
frustrations? She said, I don't remember his ever 
bringing anything home. That he would go back to

22:09.286 --> 22:10.907
the office and work. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Or he 
wouldn't go home until late. Like when we were

22:15.472 --> 22:18.475
having a session or something. No, you're right. 
He never took things home. He never discussed it

22:21.623 --> 22:25.509
and never let it affect his family life at all. In 
your days of working with the legislature, which

22:26.451 --> 22:39.113
legislators would you give gold stars to for their 
support of A&M and higher education? Well, let me

22:40.088 --> 22:50.541
preface my remark by saying that when Mr. Rutter 
was active, he handled political matters

22:40.088 --> 22:50.541
himself, legislative matters almost entirely. 
It was only when I had to substitute for him or

22:50.561 --> 22:53.384
something. Locally, of course, Bill Moore was by 
far the

22:54.225 --> 23:02.536
king, the key to the whole thing. And he carried the 
legislature in those days. They didn't call him

23:05.720 --> 23:08.543
Bull of the Brazzers for any reason. for no reason 
because he was rough and tough on them over there

23:08.793 --> 23:13.766
and got what he wanted through. A number of the 
board members were very influential with the

23:13.786 --> 23:22.870
politicians.

23:25.010 --> 23:30.620
little short guy that used to fight with Bill Moore 
that was in the legislature at that time. He was

23:30.680 --> 23:33.064
from the Gulf Coast area. Oh, uh, Babe Swartz. 
Yeah, Babe Swartz, little short guy that I call

23:34.687 --> 23:37.612
him. Reminded me of Lincoln. Debater, Douglas, I 
guess. Yeah, but in those days, a lot of the stuff

23:44.603 --> 23:56.202
was handled behind the scenes, and I was never much 
of a politician, and I never got involved with the

23:44.603 --> 23:56.202
politicians except at Mr. Rudder's behest, 
because that was one thing that he handled and

23:56.262 --> 24:00.349
handled well. He allowed me to run the campus and do 
the academics and see everything was going all

24:00.329 --> 24:10.706
right on the campus, but politics, he wanted to be 
involved. See, I have a Civic Club speech I've made

24:10.726 --> 24:14.452
a number of times. I call it... Camelot on the 
Brazos, using the Kennedy family use of that term.

24:20.325 --> 24:31.112
And I tell people that those of us that were here in 
the 60s and early 70s particularly, that we felt

24:20.325 --> 24:31.112
that things were happening. that this place was 
going. Oh, yeah, that's the thing that really

24:33.635 --> 24:42.723
stimulated me, kept me going, because we were 
putting in tremendous hours and working real

24:33.635 --> 24:42.723
hard. It was trying, too, some of this stuff. I'm 
sure it must have been. But that's what kept me

24:48.709 --> 24:52.051
going, that I could see real progress happening. 
And the fact that Mr. Rutter would almost give me

24:52.132 --> 25:00.559
carte blanche on anything academic or research or 
student-wise that I would recommend to him.

25:00.539 --> 25:06.075
except initially about abolishing the Corps and 
stuff like that. All right, do you remember any

25:06.095 --> 25:12.253
academic triumphs that cause you great pleasure 
to recall?

25:14.528 --> 25:18.918
Well, I think initially when the board approved 
Mr. Rudder's endorsement, the realignment or

25:19.359 --> 25:28.882
reorganization of A&M, which is essentially what 
it is today, with the exception of medicine. We

25:28.902 --> 25:32.470
didn't have medicine at that time. I don't know. 
The real thing was that Mr. Rutter allowed me to

25:33.413 --> 25:42.323
work with the academic deans almost at will and to 
get things done. And he would back me up, even

25:42.383 --> 25:46.608
though he might not know the background of what 
happened. If he said Hall said it, you're damn well

25:46.628 --> 25:52.154
you're going to do it. I shouldn't use that 
language. No, no, no. Now, the commencement

25:55.218 --> 26:00.364
ceremonies here to me have always been 
impressive. Were they pretty similar when you

26:00.344 --> 26:07.587
started as the chief academic officer to what they 
are now? Were they then shaking every hand,

26:08.169 --> 26:12.463
calling every name? Yeah, every Aggie walked 
across the stage, his name was called. I think I can

26:17.240 --> 26:23.647
remember that we did it several times in the early 
days. There was no air conditioning. When

26:24.888 --> 26:31.436
Eisenhower gave the commencement address, we had 
it out in the stadium or near the stadium. Oh, yeah.

26:35.140 --> 26:37.824
Those days I didn't even own a cap and gown. I had to 
run it each time That's how I used to bitch about

26:37.864 --> 26:48.340
when I was a young sister professor to put that 
money out Later his I got to be chairman. I bought

26:48.400 --> 26:55.150
finally bought a cap and got figured I was gonna 
have to Wear it every year two or three times a year.

26:55.390 --> 26:55.410
I i've always thought that's one of the traditions 
here that is a nice inclusive item that kind of

26:56.116 --> 27:20.368
makes it an aggie family in fact the parents 
usually came when they were looking forward to

26:56.116 --> 27:20.368
seeing their son's name called out and therefore 
when we ask them for their assistance five years or

27:20.348 --> 27:40.602
fifty years later that positive last memory was 
uh... was so good that you say you have an eleven

27:20.348 --> 27:40.602
o'clock yeah i gotta go to through the dark let's 
uh... let's then terminate today okay and we'll

27:20.348 --> 27:40.602
resume uh... at another time of your convenience 
well almost any time
