WEBVTT

00:02.242 --> 00:05.105
On Monday the 9th, 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:05.125 --> 00:08.770
1, 2, 3, 4, testing on Monday the 9th.

00:10.272 --> 00:11.753
This is the 9th of April.

00:11.773 --> 00:21.345
We are over in the Hagler building, and I have the pleasure and honor of chatting with Harry Green, class of 1948.

00:21.365 --> 00:21.866
52.

00:22.046 --> 00:27.653
I'm sorry, 58, 52, because he and I finished college the same year.

00:27.813 --> 00:28.013
Right.

00:28.516 --> 00:44.280
In order to introduce yourself to anyone who would hear this tape or read the transcription, describe biographically Harry Green, his family background, where'd you grow up, where'd you go to high school, what did mom and dad do for a living?

00:44.902 --> 01:09.782
I was born in San Antonio, 1930, and at the age of one and a half we moved to Houston, out in the East End area of Houston, and where I grew up, where I was reared, I went to J. Pickney Henderson Elementary School, Jackson and Austin, Stephen F. Austin High School in Houston, after which I attended Texas A&M.

01:10.783 --> 01:11.905
What did Mom and Dad do?

01:12.560 --> 01:31.911
My dad was an accountant, and my mother stayed home and took care of us while he had one sister, two years older than I am, and she has since deceased several years ago, and so what else?

01:32.992 --> 01:35.316
Why did you attend Texas A&M?

01:35.496 --> 01:37.740
Did you, why not somewhere else?

01:38.581 --> 01:47.254
Well, for some reason, I did not have any other place in mind to go to school except Texas A&M.

01:47.975 --> 02:00.994
And why I chose it, I've thought back and I really don't know because my daddy didn't go to college nor my mother and no one in our family went to A&M to give me any connection.

02:01.531 --> 02:09.323
I did, however, go to church with a young man named Wimberly who came to church on occasion in his boots.

02:10.285 --> 02:12.668
And maybe that had something to do with it, I'm not sure.

02:13.009 --> 02:13.329
His Aggie boots?

02:13.349 --> 02:15.212
Yeah, his Aggie boots, senior boots.

02:16.554 --> 02:20.460
And that may have had something to do with it, but I can't say even that for sure.

02:20.520 --> 02:24.526
But I just never wanted to go any place but here for some reason.

02:24.547 --> 02:28.112
Who encouraged you to go to college at all?

02:29.189 --> 02:41.551
Well, my family did, of course, my father and the family, and then the peers in school, most of us were going someplace, and we had a group coming up here, which was good to know the people.

02:41.631 --> 02:43.535
Had some of the football players, athletes.

02:43.635 --> 02:47.241
I was running track at the time, so I came up here to run track.

02:47.322 --> 02:53.172
I was not on scholarship, but Colonel Anderson, the track coach, allowed me to

02:53.675 --> 03:00.185
move into the athletic dorm my first year and try to work for a scholarship.

03:00.906 --> 03:04.872
Did you come to visit before coming up to enroll?

03:04.892 --> 03:06.455
No, didn't come to visit before.

03:06.495 --> 03:18.754
I'd sent the papers in and was accepted and came up and my daddy brought me and a friend, Dwight Edward King, who lived two houses down

03:18.987 --> 03:46.699
brought us both up here and dropped us off at the, he was going to play football and dropped us off at Kyle Field and we met Dawg Dawson who took us over to the athletic dorm which was Hart Hall at the time and got us checked in and then we started our college career at that point.

03:47.152 --> 03:51.537
As far as you can recall, what did you bring in the way of paraphernalia and gear?

03:53.099 --> 03:53.880
How much and how little?

03:56.824 --> 03:58.066
I really didn't bring too much.

03:58.126 --> 04:04.513
Brought a suitcase, you know, and stuff like that, some clothes.

04:04.954 --> 04:11.182
But we knew that we were going to be issued the stuff, so we didn't bring too much.

04:12.503 --> 04:13.024
Who was the?

04:13.392 --> 04:14.273
Who greeted you?

04:14.293 --> 04:15.475
Who received you?

04:15.796 --> 04:24.489
Doug Dawson, who was assistant coach at the time, greeted us and took us in and introduced us to some of the other coaches.

04:24.549 --> 04:26.071
I don't remember who they were at this time.

04:26.131 --> 04:33.342
I just remember him because my daddy shook his hand and he introduced himself to my dad and dad shook his hand.

04:33.322 --> 04:50.537
His hand, Dog Dawson's hand, was about twice the size of my dad's, who Dog Dawson was about 6'6", 6'7", had played, I believe, tackle here back in the early days and impressed my father completely about his size, so.

04:51.918 --> 04:56.283
something in the mail that told you you had been admitted?

04:56.743 --> 04:57.524
Yes.

04:57.624 --> 05:08.636
We got stuff from the admissions office that we'd been admitted and that we were to move into Hart Hall, which was the athletic dorm.

05:09.637 --> 05:14.202
Describe your first impressions of A&M of that first day or two.

05:14.222 --> 05:14.763
What was it like?

05:15.704 --> 05:19.748
Well, the first day or two was very bleak and

05:21.483 --> 05:29.450
That's the first time I'd been away from home, so it was really, you know, sort of away from home.

05:29.470 --> 05:40.401
And so it was an eye-opener, so to speak, with the sophomores running around explaining things to us that I didn't understand.

05:40.421 --> 05:44.304
So, but it was good.

05:44.384 --> 05:49.549
The people I met were really good people, and it turned out to be greater people, you know, after you.

05:49.715 --> 05:52.939
Now, had you seen Aggies before at a Rice football game?

05:53.179 --> 05:54.641
Yes, I'd been to Rice football.

05:54.661 --> 06:04.934
I had been to a football game or two at Rice and watched them play, and they impressed me, you know, the band and so forth.

06:05.014 --> 06:07.497
But I'd never been up here to a game.

06:07.537 --> 06:12.203
I'd never been up here at all until I came up that day to enter school.

06:12.223 --> 06:17.730
When your dad was getting ready to leave, did he give you any instructions or guidance or?

06:19.111 --> 06:20.273
No, I don't think so.

06:20.853 --> 06:22.936
It's just the usual good lucker.

06:23.817 --> 06:26.921
How much money did you have in your pocket?

06:26.941 --> 06:27.262
Do you remember?

06:27.282 --> 06:28.463
Probably two or three dollars.

06:29.865 --> 06:32.849
Do you remember what that first year cost?

06:32.869 --> 06:37.214
The first year, I believe, was 70, I think it was $75 a semester.

06:38.496 --> 06:45.405
And that included room and board, 18 hours of classes,

06:46.752 --> 06:52.863
clothes, uniforms, laundry, everything but books.

06:53.544 --> 06:57.931
We had to buy our books, which were not too expensive, I don't recall.

06:59.274 --> 07:02.099
Did your brother and dad pay for that?

07:02.119 --> 07:05.284
Yes, they were able to afford that.

07:07.238 --> 07:17.775
My mother would send me about a dollar a week, and that got me through any paper I needed and through the coffee that we drank between classes and so forth.

07:17.835 --> 07:22.082
But at that time, we really didn't need all that much.

07:22.122 --> 07:25.888
No one in the outfit had a car, so we didn't go very many places.

07:25.948 --> 07:31.377
We walked to the north gate or wherever and walked to church and walked everywhere we went.

07:31.397 --> 07:33.060
Everything was close at hand.

07:33.378 --> 07:36.884
And so we really didn't need that much money, you know.

07:36.904 --> 07:40.930
Describe the campus as you gradually got acquainted with it physically.

07:40.950 --> 07:41.551
What was where?

07:42.052 --> 07:48.542
Well, the campus in Hart Hall, Hart Hall is pretty well the most central dorm on the campus.

07:48.562 --> 07:57.276
So it was very easy for us to get around to the, to the, to class because the,

07:57.526 --> 08:04.116
Physics building, chemistry building, my right at hand, academic building where all the English, history, math was taught.

08:04.216 --> 08:09.524
Old Pfeiffer Hall was there where we had math and what else?

08:09.544 --> 08:13.510
Oh, the ME shops were there where we had our shop classes.

08:14.632 --> 08:18.538
So it was all very handy.

08:18.518 --> 08:26.266
what was it, Ross Hall, where the Commandant's Office was, was right next door to the dorm on Military Walk.

08:27.187 --> 08:34.053
So we were close to, and right across the street from the drill field, which is now, so.

08:34.474 --> 08:37.917
What did you, how did you get courses selected?

08:37.937 --> 08:39.218
Was that done by mail?

08:39.559 --> 08:41.220
No, the courses, we stood in line.

08:41.461 --> 08:43.783
We had a lot of cards to fill out.

08:43.932 --> 08:45.013
and we stood in line.

08:45.053 --> 08:52.901
They had a table set up in Sebesa Hall, and you'd go stand in line on certain alphabetical order.

08:53.061 --> 08:54.202
You'd fill cards out.

08:54.943 --> 09:13.821
I think there were about 12 cards on this one sheet we had to fill out for different reasons in different places, and so we'd run to English class that we'd try to fill out a schedule, and then we'd go to this English class, so to speak, and say, I need English.

09:14.240 --> 09:20.889
At this time and hour, it's full, so then we'd have to run back and redo and then go to the next one and try to fill them in.

09:22.791 --> 09:41.817
The good thing about that, we probably met most of our friends that have remained our friends standing in those lines because they've been real good people and... You know, I like...

09:42.488 --> 09:43.850
Yeah.

09:43.870 --> 09:47.996
Who advised you as far as you remember that first semester?

09:48.417 --> 09:50.320
Who told you what courses to take?

09:50.620 --> 09:52.483
Did you have a major already in mind?

09:53.825 --> 09:56.789
Yes, I had a major in mind and then we just kind of looked in the book.

09:57.590 --> 10:00.855
I don't know that they, they were just different.

10:02.177 --> 10:10.369
I think they gave us a schedule in the athletic department, you know, just to,

10:10.990 --> 10:14.393
kind of a mammograph sheet that told us the freshman courses.

10:15.014 --> 10:28.448
And so each one of us, if we were going into the engineering or going into business, I think they had the different things down as what, I don't ever remember going by the engineering office and talking to a counselor and all of that business.

10:28.508 --> 10:30.410
I think we just, they were pretty standard.

10:30.430 --> 10:32.432
It was English history, you know.

10:32.872 --> 10:38.618
As far as you remember, was it the fact that you were from Hart Hall and an athlete,

10:39.408 --> 10:42.773
Was that an advantage or a disadvantage that day in registration?

10:43.734 --> 10:45.297
It wasn't any advantage at all.

10:45.337 --> 10:46.919
We just went down and got what we could.

10:47.159 --> 10:47.900
Like everybody else?

10:47.920 --> 10:48.922
Like everybody else.

10:48.962 --> 10:49.362
No.

10:50.364 --> 10:58.716
I think the football players got a little advantage to go in because they had to have the afternoons, but I was running track and the track people in the

10:59.067 --> 11:10.625
The rest of the athletes I don't think had any advantage because we just worked out when we got time, when we finished class and went out and worked out until we marched to dinner.

11:11.226 --> 11:15.793
All right, so you get those classes all done.

11:16.775 --> 11:18.898
Let's go back to Hart Hall.

11:19.182 --> 11:24.469
What was it like those first few weeks being a fish?

11:24.489 --> 11:33.361
The first few weeks being a fish, I met my fish buddies, which were great people, and got acquainted with them.

11:33.761 --> 11:37.706
And they were all much faster than I was, I found out later.

11:38.047 --> 11:46.658
But anyway, then to meet the sophomores who were pretty, they were not really as bad on us.

11:48.140 --> 11:52.808
We knew there were sophomores around any time we stepped out of the building somewhere.

11:52.828 --> 12:04.748
And the one thing I remember, the first sophomore I met was in his room by the name of Fuston McCarty from Muleshoe, Texas.

12:05.048 --> 12:05.749
Fuston?

12:05.769 --> 12:08.654
Fuston, F. F-U-S-T-O-N.

12:08.674 --> 12:11.599
Fuston McCarty from Muleshoe, Texas.

12:12.220 --> 12:15.785
And he said, I whipped out and met him as I'm supposed to.

12:15.865 --> 12:16.706
I did learn that.

12:17.267 --> 12:21.312
And he said, I'm from Muleshoe, Texas.

12:21.332 --> 12:23.435
He said, you know where Muleshoe is, Fish Green?

12:23.455 --> 12:25.298
I said, no, sir.

12:26.239 --> 12:28.943
He said, well, you find out before you see me again.

12:29.323 --> 12:30.705
So I had to go find out.

12:30.805 --> 12:32.268
I'd never been out of Harris County.

12:32.968 --> 12:36.113
You know, back in the 30s and 40s, we didn't travel too far from home.

12:37.455 --> 12:41.400
So I had to go find out where Muleshoe was before I ran into him again.

12:42.140 --> 12:43.382
He's really a great guy.

12:43.862 --> 12:47.527
Of course, I've kept that friendship, or we have, for all these years.

12:50.050 --> 12:51.132
But it was kind of funny.

12:53.154 --> 13:01.505
All of the sophomores and all the other student officers were athletes?

13:01.745 --> 13:02.006
Yes.

13:02.466 --> 13:03.808
Everybody in Hart Hall was.

13:06.592 --> 13:09.936
The military, we were...

13:10.237 --> 13:34.793
In military outfits in Hart Hall, A, athletics was all the football team, and they had their top sergeants, corporals, top sergeants, lieutenants, captains, and all the other sports, the minor sports they would call them in those days, I think they're non-revenue sports today, was B, athletics.

13:35.667 --> 13:44.903
And we had a CO and lieutenants and platoons, and then we had a, we were a battalion.

13:44.923 --> 13:50.833
We had a battalion commander, and then it skated down to the companies and so forth.

13:50.873 --> 13:55.881
But right there, our battalion commander was in A Athletics, I think.

13:56.603 --> 13:59.768
Did you have the same kind of freshman duties that?

14:00.355 --> 14:02.117
fish did in the other company?

14:02.137 --> 14:03.418
No, I don't think so.

14:03.438 --> 14:05.280
You didn't have to go clean up some sophomore's room?

14:05.340 --> 14:06.641
No, no, we didn't have to do that.

14:06.661 --> 14:14.109
We were pretty fortunate in that line that we didn't really get caught in as bad in.

14:14.129 --> 14:16.551
We didn't have to clean up any rooms or anything.

14:16.972 --> 14:20.635
What kind of things happened in the hallways those first few weeks?

14:22.057 --> 14:27.342
Well, we just got chewed out on a lot, you know, as sophomores will do, but it wasn't,

14:28.115 --> 14:34.042
wasn't a real bad thing because we were out at the track getting acquainted with the people.

14:34.082 --> 14:56.569
But I do remember the seniors that year, a guy named Bilderback and one named Holbrook and one named Art Hornden, who was on the Olympic mile relay team, backed all the freshmen into the wall at Cobb Field.

14:57.511 --> 15:02.838
and dressed us down more so than any sophomore could have dressed us down.

15:02.878 --> 15:09.467
They were all veterans, of course, because not a one of us took time to meet those guys.

15:10.589 --> 15:18.420
When we got on the, when we came to the campus and went out to start working out, we didn't stop and meet them.

15:18.840 --> 15:23.687
Bad news, bad news not meeting the seniors.

15:24.916 --> 15:26.858
But we did do that after that.

15:26.958 --> 15:28.540
We met everybody we could find.

15:29.702 --> 15:33.206
Was the broom or paddle used in the Hart Hall?

15:33.606 --> 15:36.029
It wasn't used in our track area.

15:36.569 --> 15:39.793
I think it was used up in the football area, but not where we were.

15:42.536 --> 15:49.404
Describe going to class the first days.

15:49.825 --> 15:50.726
What was the routine?

15:50.786 --> 15:52.968
What was a typical day like?

15:53.008 --> 15:54.450
What time and where?

15:55.257 --> 16:05.212
Well, all the classes started at 8 o'clock, so we got up early and dressed and marched from Hart Hall to Sebiza Dining Hall for breakfast.

16:05.233 --> 16:11.983
And, of course, it was family style and we sat with our outfits and

16:13.482 --> 16:41.565
Then it was kind of the humorous thing about marching the chow was being athletes we all marched route step until we hit Ross Hall where the commandant was who happened to be Colonel Boatner which I'm sure some people have told you about that young man and his office faced military walk so he was there every morning watching us so we

16:42.355 --> 16:51.268
our company commander would give us left, right, past Ross Hall, and then we'd go back to route step until we got to the

16:52.177 --> 16:53.840
It was kind of a lax operation.

16:54.802 --> 17:13.476
But anyway, we were all military in the athletics, and we all went to military science, which was a freshman basic course, and all wore uniforms, A and B athletics all the time, just like they do now.

17:13.895 --> 17:20.905
And in the dining hall, did you all have the same routine about the passing of food and all?

17:21.085 --> 17:21.966
Same routine.

17:22.327 --> 17:26.352
It wasn't as bad as it was in the Corps.

17:27.253 --> 17:33.642
After my freshman year, I went over to the Corps because I knew I wasn't going to make it on the track team.

17:33.976 --> 17:39.149
And the sophomores called it bad over there because the freshmen were still at the annex.

17:39.169 --> 17:42.016
So it was a bad deal.

17:42.978 --> 17:47.308
But they did do the cush questions and all that stuff over there.

17:47.850 --> 17:52.120
Your freshman year here, had the annex

17:52.623 --> 17:54.926
My freshman class was at the annex.

17:54.946 --> 17:58.890
All right, so you were among the few, there weren't many freshmen on the campus?

17:59.130 --> 18:00.652
No, just the Hart Hall freshmen.

18:01.332 --> 18:01.393
Oh.

18:01.413 --> 18:01.933
That's all.

18:02.474 --> 18:03.375
I hadn't thought of that.

18:03.395 --> 18:03.515
Yeah.

18:03.535 --> 18:06.258
So there weren't many freshman classes?

18:07.459 --> 18:07.659
No.

18:09.181 --> 18:10.122
Oh, I hadn't thought.

18:10.142 --> 18:12.925
No, but there were a lot of people taking them over.

18:14.567 --> 18:18.411
They had enough to fill a class, you know.

18:18.914 --> 18:21.798
You got up, you marched to child.

18:21.959 --> 18:22.880
And came back and.

18:23.521 --> 18:25.564
Had classes pretty well all morning.

18:26.045 --> 18:26.465
All day.

18:27.266 --> 18:28.068
Okay.

18:28.088 --> 18:30.031
Describe as far as you can.

18:30.091 --> 18:32.013
We came back and cleaned our room up.

18:32.034 --> 18:43.791
I mean, we did do that, make the beds and got it ready for inspection, so to speak, because we were military, maybe half military, but anyway, we were military.

18:43.771 --> 18:46.514
Then we went to class.

18:46.534 --> 18:52.200
We didn't have to march to class, but we did wear uniforms and went to class from 8 to 12.

18:53.041 --> 18:55.243
The whistle blew at 12 and everybody quit.

18:55.824 --> 18:56.825
Everybody went home.

18:58.547 --> 19:02.972
The professors, administration, school lockdown.

19:04.193 --> 19:07.857
One o'clock, the whistle blew.

19:08.738 --> 19:09.519
Everything opened.

19:09.619 --> 19:10.740
Everybody was back.

19:12.205 --> 19:17.872
But then we marched to lunch and then we marched to dinner when we got through practice.

19:17.892 --> 19:23.719
And we'd go to class one or two or three or four hours in the afternoon, according to whether we had lab or not.

19:23.939 --> 19:40.339
And then we'd go work out and then come back and clean up and change clothes and go to march to breakfast and then come back, I mean to dinner, and then come back and study and whatever.

19:40.910 --> 19:46.215
Now, in the afternoons, did you start working out for track early?

19:46.695 --> 19:48.397
We started out in September, yeah.

19:49.298 --> 19:57.966
The quarter-milers and above, which I was, worked on a cross-country course from September to January.

19:58.046 --> 20:07.354
Then everybody in January went into their particular field, whether it was sprinting hurdles or quarter-mile or half.

20:07.374 --> 20:10.377
Describe that routine as well as you can because I haven't had anybody yet.

20:10.846 --> 20:11.747
What routine?

20:13.088 --> 20:15.311
That kind of workout for fall.

20:15.731 --> 20:36.212
Oh well Ray Putnam was our distance coach and Colonel Andy was the hurdler and sprint coach and who was the head coach Colonel Andy and so we'd go over and get with Putnam and dress in the locker room and at Caulfield we had a dressing room which is now the

20:37.778 --> 20:39.860
Visitor's dressing room, so to speak.

20:39.900 --> 20:45.486
It was over on the east side of the field, underneath the stadium.

20:45.506 --> 20:47.968
That time of year, only for track.

20:48.429 --> 20:49.470
Only for track, right.

20:50.070 --> 20:56.297
And so then we'd take out on a cross-country course, which went, it was three and a half miles, I think.

20:57.618 --> 21:04.765
And you can't visualize it today, but we went out across, it started across the tracks

21:06.753 --> 21:25.808
probably about where the rec center is today and it went on a dirt road which might be old Kyle or George Bush Road today somewhere.

21:25.848 --> 21:27.411
I don't think it went all the way through there.

21:27.431 --> 21:28.032
I'm not sure.

21:28.052 --> 21:29.655
I don't think it did though.

21:30.293 --> 21:44.069
And then it went around past what is today the Bush Library and then back down university or back by the vet school because the vet school wasn't out there.

21:44.129 --> 21:45.971
So it was all back in that area.

21:47.033 --> 21:50.196
And so it was three and a half miles.

21:51.037 --> 21:52.619
So we just ran that every day.

21:52.679 --> 21:54.141
How many times?

21:54.982 --> 21:56.084
Well, I only ran it once.

21:56.124 --> 21:58.387
I couldn't make it around, but once J.D.

21:58.427 --> 22:06.839
Hampton, the number one two-miler in the nation, he passed me about the three-quarter mark, which was the alfalfa hay barns.

22:08.161 --> 22:23.824
And we had a quarter-miler named Mitchell from Deer Park, Don Mitchell, I believe it was, that he used to get rides on bicycles and on the tailgate of pickup trucks.

22:24.968 --> 22:27.511
until he beat Hampton back one day.

22:27.531 --> 22:39.568
He forgot where JD was in the race or just in the workouts and he crossed the line before Hampton did and Mr. Putnam finally discovered what he was doing.

22:39.608 --> 22:45.356
They usually wait on the corner until Hampton passed him and then he'd come in behind him sometime.

22:45.376 --> 22:52.866
So it wasn't good to beat JD around the track and the last guy through had to close the gates.

22:53.825 --> 22:55.929
Now, about how many would have been in this group?

22:57.591 --> 23:03.121
There's probably 15 or 20 of us that would be in that group.

23:03.141 --> 23:05.445
Now, was that the entire afternoon's workout?

23:05.465 --> 23:05.645
Oh, yeah.

23:05.665 --> 23:06.146
What else did you do?

23:07.048 --> 23:10.213
Well, just exercise, you know, but that was about to work out.

23:10.514 --> 23:13.077
And about what time did this occur?

23:13.097 --> 23:21.126
Well, we'd get out there about from 3.30 on and do that and then get through sometime around 5 or so.

23:21.166 --> 23:23.669
I think we ate at 6 is what I think.

23:24.370 --> 23:27.313
Anyway, sometime whenever we were all back.

23:27.874 --> 23:35.122
If we didn't get back, then we'd just casually walk down to Subison and go on in and eat.

23:35.843 --> 23:39.407
And your group of guys didn't have intramurals?

23:40.012 --> 23:42.956
like most of the rest of the Corps did?

23:44.358 --> 23:45.679
I'm not sure they may have.

23:45.779 --> 23:50.666
I didn't participate in any of them, but I don't think we did.

23:50.706 --> 23:55.011
There wasn't too many intramurals in those days.

23:55.031 --> 23:56.193
Not like today, anyway.

23:57.074 --> 24:02.661
Describe as well as you can those first few weeks of going to class.

24:02.761 --> 24:03.743
What was it like?

24:03.763 --> 24:04.804
Who were some of the...

24:05.307 --> 24:08.732
teachers you remember and some of the courses you remember?

24:08.752 --> 24:32.310
Well the first two or three days going to class was very interesting because as you remember when we went the classes were only about 25 to 30 in a class and once again you had to meet everybody in the class before you sat down and then meet them until you call them by name at the next class so

24:33.995 --> 24:35.136
which was a great thing.

24:35.156 --> 24:44.288
It taught us a lot on courtesy and the ability to meet people no matter where we were or what we were doing, and particularly started with the upper class.

24:44.308 --> 24:52.339
However, in the freshman courses, there weren't too many upper classmen, but anyway, there were some sophomores in there maybe.

24:52.359 --> 24:56.544
And the professors were good professors.

24:56.564 --> 24:57.826
They were like a bunch of them.

24:57.846 --> 25:03.613
A lot of them were A&M graduates who just graduated and stayed in on to teach.

25:05.078 --> 25:16.852
I had a trigonometry professor that, at the time, was one of the seven people in the world that understood Einstein's theory of relativity.

25:18.194 --> 25:19.035
Name was Kent.

25:21.718 --> 25:23.220
Called him Kubrick Kent.

25:25.322 --> 25:26.804
As a matter of fact, he just died.

25:28.766 --> 25:31.069
He may not be dead yet, as a matter of fact.

25:31.657 --> 25:32.699
Oh, yeah, he's been alive.

25:33.020 --> 25:36.206
I saw him just two years ago at the Shrine of Fish Fry.

25:37.568 --> 25:38.891
He may have died since then.

25:38.931 --> 25:41.997
I'm not sure, but if he has, it's the last two years.

25:42.197 --> 25:45.543
Describe him as well as you can remember.

25:45.563 --> 25:52.737
Oh, he was a tall, thin, gangly-type professor.

25:53.138 --> 26:04.156
He'd write the problem on the board with his right hand and with an eraser on the left and expect us to get it, you know, because he was so sharp at it and he thought everybody else was.

26:04.256 --> 26:06.320
So he'd just go along like that.

26:06.340 --> 26:10.607
If you didn't get it, well.

26:10.627 --> 26:14.573
But anyway, he was a... Where did that nickname come from?

26:15.295 --> 26:16.517
I have no idea.

26:16.557 --> 26:19.361
That's what they called him when I got to class, cube root Kent.

26:19.722 --> 26:29.096
Now, I've heard some people say that supposedly the cube root of the number of students taking the class would pass it.

26:29.116 --> 26:29.978
That's probably right.

26:30.919 --> 26:31.880
Was it a tough course?

26:34.424 --> 26:37.489
I don't, it wasn't really tough if you studied.

26:37.823 --> 26:39.446
typical trigonometry class.

26:39.927 --> 26:47.860
It wasn't that tough, but you had a tendency sometimes not to study too hard, so it was tough.

26:48.441 --> 26:51.366
He was tough, because if you didn't get your homework in, you didn't pass.

26:52.628 --> 26:55.413
You know, he gave you assignments to do each day.

26:56.996 --> 27:00.642
And you turn them in the next day, whether he graded them, I don't know, he never gave them back.

27:01.313 --> 27:04.757
But if you didn't turn them in, you didn't pass.

27:05.057 --> 27:09.041
You know, he was a, he just wanted you to do the work primarily.

27:09.061 --> 27:12.685
Was his grading system, as far as you know, the calls, did it seem fair?

27:13.366 --> 27:14.668
Oh, yeah.

27:14.708 --> 27:16.830
They all graded on a curve then, for one thing.

27:17.431 --> 27:30.645
But the fairness of A&M at that time, if you were in each individual class, like an English class or a trigonometry class, if you were in the upper 25 percent,

27:31.553 --> 27:34.438
in grades at the end of the year you didn't have to take a final.

27:35.460 --> 27:41.111
So that meant that four or five students out of each class didn't have to take the final.

27:41.151 --> 27:47.142
So there were some students went through here and never took a final because graduating seniors didn't have to take final.

27:47.843 --> 27:54.355
So you could feasibly go through here without taking one final if you just kept up during the semester.

27:55.718 --> 28:00.423
And so it was, and like I say, they graded on the curve.

28:00.443 --> 28:02.104
So it was all fair.

28:02.925 --> 28:11.113
And in that course from Professor Kent, had your high school reasonably prepared you for that?

28:11.133 --> 28:11.374
Oh, yeah.

28:11.834 --> 28:12.255
Yeah, it had.

28:12.595 --> 28:14.977
What about some of the other courses, English, history?

28:17.240 --> 28:19.101
They had pretty well all prepared us.

28:19.121 --> 28:25.708
And the problem with English 103 was it was all composition, rhetoric they called it, I think.

28:26.347 --> 28:30.273
and you can either write or you can't, so either pass or fail, you know.

28:30.994 --> 28:36.201
They didn't really teach you how to write, so you either passed or failed.

28:36.221 --> 28:39.446
You could sit down and write a composition on your hip pocket.

28:40.468 --> 28:52.145
Sometimes it'd be a paragraph, sometimes it'd be three pages, according to what the guy was thinking about when he assigned you the deal, you know, or you couldn't, you know, so you'd make grades in between, whatever the case may be.

28:52.625 --> 28:55.830
Do you remember your English teacher in freshman year?

28:56.080 --> 29:01.745
That freshman year was, gosh, he just, Limpy Keel.

29:02.726 --> 29:02.806
Who?

29:02.826 --> 29:04.868
Mr. Keel, K-E-E-L.

29:05.068 --> 29:05.809
Called him Limpy.

29:06.289 --> 29:07.250
He walked with a limp.

29:08.411 --> 29:11.874
Dr. Keel, I think it was.

29:11.894 --> 29:12.895
Called him Limpy Keel.

29:12.915 --> 29:15.037
Wasn't too good because he did have a bad limp.

29:15.357 --> 29:16.659
I don't know if you remember him or not.

29:16.699 --> 29:23.785
But anyway, he was, he was around here just for a few years ago also.

29:23.865 --> 29:26.087
So they've been around.

29:26.303 --> 29:29.707
And then other courses you had?

29:29.727 --> 29:30.308
Science?

29:30.568 --> 29:31.189
History?

29:31.809 --> 29:32.510
Had all those.

29:33.832 --> 29:36.235
Had a guy named Williams as a history professor.

29:36.715 --> 29:38.297
Dr. Williams, I believe he was.

29:39.458 --> 29:40.780
He was a car nut.

29:42.102 --> 29:43.203
Had an old Chevrolet.

29:44.585 --> 29:49.170
Said he never had any work done on his Chevrolet because no two moving parts touched.

29:50.131 --> 29:51.573
So it never wore out.

29:51.593 --> 29:54.336
I think his name was William.

29:58.315 --> 30:00.918
And what was your major freshman year?

30:00.938 --> 30:05.343
Freshman year was mechanical engineering, and then I changed over to industrial technology.

30:06.003 --> 30:07.765
And why did you change?

30:08.746 --> 30:11.529
Because my chemistry and physics grades were low.

30:12.811 --> 30:14.532
Did you have those as freshmen?

30:14.552 --> 30:14.813
Yes.

30:15.714 --> 30:17.115
Who talked about them?

30:17.135 --> 30:18.377
I don't remember who they were.

30:18.417 --> 30:24.323
The one chemistry professor I had said you could bring anything to class, you get on a three by five card.

30:25.619 --> 30:29.203
So I walked in with a three-foot by five-foot card.

30:30.484 --> 30:31.546
I didn't have anything on it.

30:31.606 --> 30:33.568
I just walked into class with it.

30:34.469 --> 30:36.131
He was a pretty jovial type guy.

30:36.731 --> 30:39.134
He was a guy with kind of a bad hand.

30:39.154 --> 30:40.535
I don't know if you remember him or not.

30:41.236 --> 30:45.941
Anyway, I don't remember his name, but they were good.

30:45.961 --> 30:50.506
It wasn't anything, you know, you couldn't pass if you didn't study.

30:50.526 --> 30:51.027
They were all.

30:51.688 --> 30:54.150
Did you and your buddies go to class right now?

30:54.170 --> 30:54.531
Oh, yeah.

30:55.192 --> 30:55.592
Yeah.

30:55.842 --> 30:57.544
How did you behave in class?

30:57.564 --> 31:02.191
What were the unwritten rules about classroom conduct?

31:04.314 --> 31:07.077
We were pretty well behaved in class.

31:09.100 --> 31:09.681
Stay awake?

31:11.443 --> 31:14.547
For the best part except Mr. Keough's 1 o'clock English class.

31:15.028 --> 31:16.831
Had a little problem staying awake in there.

31:18.052 --> 31:21.597
But most of the time, then I had another day that we had.
