WEBVTT

00:02.258 --> 00:03.820
Yeah, we're picking up on it. This is January 27, I 
believe, Wednesday, and in the living room on 1016

00:04.201 --> 00:18.764
Guadalupe and College Station, talking to Bill 
Lay, and now going to stop and see if the machine is

00:04.201 --> 00:18.764
working. Bill, as a starter, to introduce you to 
any reader or listener in the future would you give

00:26.305 --> 00:48.567
a brief biographical summary up to the point that 
you go to work for A&M where did you grow up high

00:26.305 --> 00:48.567
school college other experience before you came 
to work at A&M actually I guess we call Valley Mills

00:26.305 --> 00:48.567
Texas home that's where my grandparents both 
lived and where I was born. I lived there until

00:52.206 --> 00:55.088
about we were so about six years. I was about six 
years old, about 1936. And my dad took a job at that

00:58.591 --> 01:02.455
time, which was right in the middle of depression. 
And Gatesville, Texas working with state

01:03.135 --> 01:09.661
training school over there was a school for boys 
which had had a game. So he worked over there taught

01:09.681 --> 01:15.806
paper hanging and painting to the boys and help 
with some of the maintenance there. And then about

01:16.707 --> 01:18.148
19 41, he quit that job and we moved to Pasadena, 
Texas, which was a long way from Gatesville,

01:18.348 --> 01:27.584
Texas. I spent the remainder of my youth in 
Pasadena and graduated from Pasadena High School

01:28.746 --> 01:36.720
in 1949. And at that time, one of my Actually, one of 
our former landlords was a strong Aggie

01:40.724 --> 01:57.768
supporter, and he'd always encourage me to come to 
Texas A&M, and I enrolled at Texas A&M in 1949 at

01:40.724 --> 01:57.768
what was then called the Annex, which is the old 
Bryan Air Force Base, which is now called

01:40.724 --> 01:57.768
Riverside Campus. As many of you will know, the A&M 
system used that for freshmen for four years, I

01:58.910 --> 02:07.963
believe. We were the last class there and it was 
rather spartan existence. I can remember my

02:13.285 --> 02:26.067
mother telling me about that she dropped me off at 
this tar paper buildings that they had out there at

02:13.285 --> 02:26.067
that time, turned the corner and was crying all the 
way home that she had left me in such an ungodly

02:13.285 --> 02:26.067
place as this. But we survived the annex and I came 
back onto the campus the next year and I graduated

02:26.828 --> 02:33.900
from Texas A&M in 1954. At that time, I took ROTC 
while I was at A&M. At that time, there were not

02:38.560 --> 02:41.684
enough commissions for everyone. So they gave me a 
National Guard assignment and said I could come on

02:42.485 --> 02:57.607
duty, active duty, if I wanted to as a sergeant, I 
believe, in the National Guard. And I told them no

02:57.627 --> 02:59.429
thank you at that time. So I went back and taught a 
year at school and then passed it in Texas. And

03:02.939 --> 03:18.141
sometime during the year, they found some 
commission, a commission in the National Guard

03:02.939 --> 03:18.141
for me as a second lieutenant, and then called me to 
active duty in 1954 in the summer. And of all places

03:19.162 --> 03:23.388
to send me, they sent me back to Bryan Air Force 
Base. And I thought I was going to begin and end my

03:24.289 --> 03:29.757
career at Bryan Air Force Base. Sometime again by 
the end of the summer I think they found some not

03:30.023 --> 03:46.887
regular commission but reserve commissions and I 
was given a reserve commission in the Air Force as a

03:30.023 --> 03:46.887
second lieutenant and we stayed here until 1958 
when they closed the base. In the meantime I had met

03:47.547 --> 03:56.520
a young lady and got married and we had a child while 
I was still stationed here and we went from here to

03:57.496 --> 04:05.904
England, spent three years in England, came back 
and spent about two years in San Antonio at the

03:57.496 --> 04:05.904
Security Service headquarters. And I was not 
particularly enamored with being in the Air

04:07.065 --> 04:14.393
Force, although I had a good career. But I heard 
President Kennedy at that time say, that's not

04:15.214 --> 04:22.180
what your country can do for you, but what you can do 
for your country. And I felt I would be better off in

04:23.298 --> 04:35.979
the public school, so I resigned my commission, 
which was a regular commission at that time, and a

04:23.298 --> 04:35.979
captaincy in the Air Force, and went back to 
teaching school in Pasadena, of all places. They

04:36.841 --> 04:45.475
had asked me to come back there, and I thought I was 
going to starve to death for a few years, but

04:36.841 --> 04:45.475
eventually we got on our feet, and I I began to take 
courses in school administration, and I took some

04:46.467 --> 05:00.690
work at the University of Texas during the summer 
of 1963,

04:46.467 --> 05:00.690
which was an intern-type program they had for 
prospective administrators. And went back and

05:01.932 --> 05:13.470
taught a couple of years after that, and then went 
full-time to the University of Texas in 1965 and

05:01.932 --> 05:13.470
finished up a master's and doctorate there. I was 
working for the Austin Public Schools during that

05:14.227 --> 05:25.657
period of time, working as an assistant 
principal, a principal, and a dean of men at three

05:14.227 --> 05:25.657
different times. And when I finished my 
doctorate, the Austin Public Schools didn't at

05:26.678 --> 05:39.289
that time have a specific position in 
administration for me other than an assistant

05:26.678 --> 05:39.289
principal. And I'd had enough of being an 
assistant principal. and I called my friend Ed

05:43.589 --> 06:10.407
Cooper who I had seen in the issues of Aggieland was 
working here at the university and although we

05:43.589 --> 06:10.407
hadn't been in contact with each other for quite 
some time you know Aggies and Aggies in the band

05:43.589 --> 06:10.407
especially maintain some kind of relationship 
and I called him and asked him if he knew of any

05:43.589 --> 06:10.407
positions in school administration department 
or the in the school administration department

06:11.686 --> 06:17.396
here, they might be open, thinking I might get a 
teaching job or something like this. And he said

06:18.358 --> 06:24.670
no, but he was director of admissions, and he was 
going to work for Dr. Williams, and his position

06:18.358 --> 06:24.670
was open. I wanted to come and interview for him. 
Well, at that time I didn't know what the Director

06:29.168 --> 06:42.408
of Admissions was, did, or anything else, but it 
was a chance for a job and it was a Texan A&M, so I

06:29.168 --> 06:42.408
said, sure, I'll come over and talk to him about it, 
having no idea what to expect or anything else. And

06:42.468 --> 06:53.225
I came over and interviewed with Dean Heaton and 
probably some other members of his staff, and I'm

06:42.468 --> 06:53.225
not really sure who I did talk to. When was that? 
This was in 1971. Spring, fall? In the spring of 71.

06:58.885 --> 07:06.494
And I interviewed, had a nice visit, went back 
home, and I thought, well, that's the last of that.

07:08.136 --> 07:12.942
Went ahead and carried on with the business at 
Crockett High School where I was employed. And

07:14.003 --> 07:24.336
probably two weeks later, I got another call from

07:14.003 --> 07:24.336
someone, and I'm not sure whether it was Dean 
Heaton or others from Ed, asked if I'd come back

07:25.042 --> 07:28.085
over for another interview. Well, I thought, 
well, they've narrowed it down to two or three

07:28.125 --> 07:33.872
people, and they want to do some more 
interviewing. So I jumped in the car and came back

07:33.932 --> 07:41.180
over here, and I think it was probably a Saturday 
morning, although I'm not sure what day of the week

07:33.932 --> 07:41.180
it was. And after talking a little while, he says, 
would you like to, Dr. Byers would like to talk to

07:42.461 --> 07:52.652
you. Vice President Hurst. Vice President, or he 
wasn't pro, he was Vice President Horst Byers, I

07:54.815 --> 07:59.041
believe. And I says, yes. So I went in and talked to 
Dr. Byers, and he says, well, we'd like to offer you

08:01.925 --> 08:08.554
a job. And I swallowed kind of hard because I hadn't 
even thought about it. And we talked a little bit

08:13.360 --> 08:22.453
more, and the terms were certainly better than 
what I was making, and it was kind of what I was

08:13.360 --> 08:22.453
hoping to make as far as any move that we were 
looking at and I immediately called my wife and

08:23.227 --> 08:38.364
told her to start packing the bags that we were 
coming over here and that's kind of the way I got

08:23.227 --> 08:38.364
here. I started in June of 1971.

08:44.151 --> 08:45.492
What was that opening salary? Opening salary

08:50.530 --> 08:51.631
I want to say it's 17-5. I think that's what it was. 
And this is 60, I mean 71. 1971. And the enrollment,

08:56.636 --> 08:58.578
though, I never forget. The enrollment was, give 
or take a few, 14,700. I do remember that. That's

09:04.124 --> 09:05.145
where we started. Okay. Describe the staff of 
admissions and records at that time. Who were the

09:15.997 --> 09:17.178
key people? Where were you located and so forth? 
Right now, that seems like ancient history, but

09:21.985 --> 09:24.728
I'll do my best. At that time, the office was 
located in the Koch building. We were on the second

09:31.116 --> 09:32.117
floor.

09:35.081 --> 09:37.224
The admissions part was on the second floor, to put 
it differently. And the other half was occupied by

09:37.244 --> 09:45.554
the graduate college, I believe, and the vice 
president, I think, as I recall. We had the, I guess

09:45.574 --> 09:48.297
it's the north half. The registrar's part was 
directly under us at that time. In underground, in

09:53.195 --> 09:54.998
the basement. And on the basement, that's 
correct. Dean Heaton was the dean. Ray Perryman

10:02.771 --> 10:06.056
was an associate dean. Bob Lacy was the registrar.

10:13.673 --> 10:16.496
I think Don was there at that time. Don Carter. Don 
Carter was there at that time, I believe. Carolyn

10:20.840 --> 10:25.344
Mitchell was in the admissions office. Leona Dean 
was in the admissions office. Carolyn, Ms.

10:27.406 --> 10:31.230
Mitchell took care of the transfer student area. 
Ms. Dean was taking care of the graduate admission

10:31.290 --> 10:33.693
area. And

10:34.573 --> 10:42.381
Homer Smith was taking care of the undergraduate 
area. Describe those people as professional

10:43.373 --> 10:50.643
associates, beginning with Mr. Heaton. Tell me 
about Lloyd

10:50.664 --> 10:55.090
Heaton. The thing I regret most about Mr. Heaton, 
knowing Mr. Heaton, was the fact that I didn't know

10:55.110 --> 10:59.396
him very long. Mr. Heaton retired several years 
after I got there. And I didn't work as closely with

11:06.627 --> 11:16.345
Mr. Heaton as I would have if I had been there over a 
period of time because we were working like crazy

11:06.627 --> 11:16.345
trying to keep up. Mr. Heaton was very precise, as I 
recall, very nice to me as far as I was concerned.

11:26.270 --> 11:34.442
I'll always have a fond spot in my heart for him for 
hiring me to the job, which I really thought I

11:26.270 --> 11:34.442
couldn't do any better anywhere. It turned out, I 
think, that was true. I certainly enjoyed my

11:36.586 --> 11:40.391
relationship there at all times.

11:42.294 --> 11:47.082
It's hard to remember a whole lot about Mr. Heaton 
because I just didn't work with him that long. Do

11:47.342 --> 11:50.607
you remember his key likes and dislikes? Not 
really. I really don't. That part I didn't get to

11:54.228 --> 11:56.192
know about. I knew he was very precise, I think. He 
was, I think, had an extremely high moral

12:00.600 --> 12:05.508
character.

12:08.193 --> 12:13.523
But he believed in, he believed in very strongly,

12:08.193 --> 12:13.523
I think. knowing a lot of the little intricacies 
about how he did things and I really don't remember

12:14.144 --> 12:21.096
those things it's been too long. What about then 
Perryman? Ray uh what was his responsibility and

12:23.039 --> 12:29.029
his way of doing it? Ray was his assistant 
registrar I think and at that time as I recall he I

12:29.230 --> 12:39.527
know he had charge of the graduation part of it I'm 
sure he had charge of the certain reviews of

12:40.165 --> 12:47.756
certain records and keeping the records and 
things like this, again, didn't associate with

12:40.165 --> 12:47.756
Ray very much at all. Again, he retired three or 
four years after I got there as well. And as you

12:52.604 --> 12:58.272
know, like I say, during that time admissions was 
just booming. When I walked in, there were, we had

12:58.472 --> 13:03.440
papers stacked all over the place. And because 
everything was done by hand, we, applications

13:04.101 --> 13:09.649
came in, piece by piece. We were getting more 
applications than we could handle. At that time,

13:16.019 --> 13:20.943
we still admitted everybody who qualified. We 
enrolled everybody who showed up at the door, so to

13:21.584 --> 13:25.788
speak. But the handling of the applications, we 
had very little

13:25.808 --> 13:35.518
electronic equipment to handle it, as I recall. It 
used to be that the problem was trying to get all the

13:38.636 --> 13:48.124
pieces of record together so that you could review 
an application. I never forget down in the

13:49.066 --> 13:51.449
basement itself. I think the number was 62, but I 
could be off. We had 62 four drawer filing cabinets

13:54.693 --> 14:01.702
down in the basement, which contained the records 
of applicants. Those are who people who had been

14:01.982 --> 14:04.325
here. Could we still kept the the paper file for 
years afterwards, which get that they knew just

14:13.028 --> 14:16.031
huge area down in the basement where he kept 
records and everything. Now this and these files

14:16.051 --> 14:21.476
were both those who had been admitted and those who 
had not been admitted. Yes, actually those and

14:21.936 --> 14:26.481
those who had enrolled too we kept those for a 
period of time. We kept those who had applied and

14:26.501 --> 14:30.865
didn't get admitted for a period of time and we 
eventually destroyed them. But once they were had

14:31.365 --> 14:37.971
applied and been admitted then we kept those 
records as I recall forever. We eventually got

14:38.492 --> 14:42.816
into the process of microfilming and it cut down on 
the the space that we needed and it made it much

14:43.370 --> 14:49.281
easier to find as far as that goes. We had a pretty 
good paper mill going there. Your staff as

14:52.728 --> 15:04.551
Director of Admissions, at that point, who were 
the people that worked directly with you? He

15:04.852 --> 15:07.015
actually came in as Director of Admissions. Homer 
Smith was in charge of Undergraduate Admissions.

15:10.999 --> 15:15.805
Carolyn Mitchell, the Transfer Admissions, and 
Louina Dean in Graduate Admissions. What's

15:16.566 --> 15:17.988
Dean's first name? Leona. Leona, spell it. L-A, 
capital U-N-A. And she and Ms. Mitchell had been

15:23.614 --> 15:32.445
there for a long time.

15:32.965 --> 15:44.196
many stories about Carolyn Mitchell and her 
operation there, but she

15:32.965 --> 15:44.196
was very good at what she did. She knew how to do it 
and she was very fair with everyone in that sense.

15:48.280 --> 15:50.362
Can you share some of those stories? Probably not. 
But she, I think we used to, Ms. Mitchell She tried

15:59.881 --> 16:05.928
to keep everything in order, and she was working, 
doing a number of jobs. Ms. Mitchell took care of

16:05.948 --> 16:08.611
the transfer admissions. She took care of the 
certifying of athletes, and there were one or two

16:08.631 --> 16:19.563
other jobs that she had that when she retired, we 
hired probably three other people to replace her.

16:19.583 --> 16:27.812
But Ms. Mitchell, when the applicants came in, she 
would be, not only did she do the admission of the

16:19.583 --> 16:27.812
athletes, She also did the evaluation of the 
transfer work, which in itself is a job, which now

16:28.096 --> 16:36.505
is split out. The admissions part is handled for 
one thing, and then we have another complete

16:36.565 --> 16:45.614
section handling the evaluation of the credit 
that's being transferred now. But she would

16:45.634 --> 16:52.942
always, when she'd be working on things, when 
things would be ready, it would go to the bottom of

16:45.634 --> 16:52.942
the pile, and she would work her way down. Stuff 
didn't get on the top of the pile. I always was

16:54.624 --> 16:57.647
amazed at how she kept things in order, you know. Or 
she was working on three different things. She'd

17:00.960 --> 17:04.225
work a while on this and she'd work a while on 
something else. I will share one thing with you. I

17:06.308 --> 17:09.573
don't think she would mind hearing this. In 
certifying the athletes, because it was just as

17:09.653 --> 17:19.568
much a problem then as it is now, if not more in the 
sense that you didn't have as much... much help and

17:20.341 --> 17:25.054
he didn't have as good a way of keeping track of 
things as we do now. But I do remember she said that

17:25.716 --> 17:31.633
in Ed Hargett's case that she cheated on Ed Hargett 
in reporting She says, Ed Hargett had a 4.01

17:32.609 --> 17:41.017
because of the fact at that time we gave credit for 
PE, but no hours. And therefore, you can have

17:41.398 --> 17:43.620
better than a 4.0. And she said she knew nobody 
believed he had a 4.01, so she just rounded it to a

17:44.020 --> 17:48.605
4.0. Oh, now that's a good story. Because I had Ed in 
class, and I remember what a good student he was in

17:51.868 --> 17:56.533
my history class. All right, when you began, did 
anybody give you advice and counsel in how to do the

18:02.174 --> 18:06.199
task? What guidance, what advice did you get to 
begin?

18:12.648 --> 18:14.610
I'm sure that I was given some. It's hard to 
remember right now. I do remember that

18:16.353 --> 18:30.291
the

18:16.353 --> 18:30.291
person who was in charge of the freshman 
admissions had some leave coming and my coming

18:30.980 --> 18:42.840
there coincided with the amount of leave he had to 
take before he was going to retire or to leave the

18:30.980 --> 18:42.840
university. And soon after I got there with a brief 
amount of instructions, he took his leave and I was

18:43.681 --> 18:54.760
in charge at that time. and didn't have the person 
in charge of the freshman admissions and I was

18:55.145 --> 19:08.486
trying to hire a person to be in charge of the 
freshman admissions during the summer while I was

18:55.145 --> 19:08.486
trying to learn the job and we were trying to keep 
applications flowing at that time. So it got

19:09.087 --> 19:12.692
really hectic that first summer. Did anybody tell 
you any absolute do's and don'ts?

19:19.057 --> 19:20.279
It's hard to learn. I'm sure we were given 
instructions, guidance as to what the admission

19:20.299 --> 19:32.843
criteria was and I'm sure that we went by that.

19:36.009 --> 19:37.251
I don't recall

19:40.775 --> 19:44.319
being given instruction as particular ways of 
having to do things. Actually, I was trying to

19:44.339 --> 19:48.904
learn the process of doing things, which is what I 
was trying to do. Trying to learn how to check to see

19:49.565 --> 19:54.010
the student had the proper admission. Trying to, 
I'm sure at that time, although I don't remember

19:54.070 --> 20:07.626
the specifics, dealing with concerns of people 
who wanted to get their students admitted and

19:54.070 --> 20:07.626
those kinds of procedures. Other than the fact 
that it was a whirl of paper and that I was trying to

20:08.129 --> 20:21.975
hire a new assistant director of admissions, it's 
kind of a blur as to what happened at that time. In

20:21.995 --> 20:29.850
those early years, for you early years, an 
application included a transcript

20:31.079 --> 20:31.800
And what else? The high school, they had to furnish 
us a transcript which would reflect certain

20:32.481 --> 20:40.633
credits which they had to have for admission. And 
then we based it on a... Was there any other pieces

20:41.654 --> 20:48.143
of paper? A standardized test, an SAT or the ACT. We 
were already requiring that of all? As I recall,

20:53.932 --> 20:57.376
there was a minimum that you had to have. I'd have to 
go back and check it. quite some time, but I was

20:59.615 --> 21:08.227
thinking that we had to have the high school 
graduate a certain score on the SAT and a certain

20:59.615 --> 21:08.227
class rank on that. You don't remember what those 
were? I really don't remember what they were. I

21:11.893 --> 21:24.811
know we increased it in probably,

21:11.893 --> 21:24.811
Dr. Williams was there in 1976. That sounded like a 
good year. Because I remember that in questioning

21:27.796 --> 21:51.078
the

21:27.796 --> 21:51.078
testing office, they'd come up with a cut-off 
figure, as I recall, and they'd made certain

21:27.796 --> 21:51.078
studies on what levels they thought were 
appropriate and what weren't. I think that it was

21:52.879 --> 21:57.043
800 in the top half, I'm not sure on the thing. 900 in 
the third quarter and 1,000 in the fourth. That was

22:02.699 --> 22:07.003
a criteria at some time, and I think that's when we 
came in in 1971. That's what we used. Give me some

22:12.168 --> 22:20.576
examples of disappointed applicants or 
disappointed parents of applicants. What were

22:21.216 --> 22:23.098
some of the experiences you had?

22:26.081 --> 22:26.541
Any time. about admissions. There had to be phone 
calls, letters. Oh, gosh, there's, I'm sure there

22:33.572 --> 22:37.537
are literally hundreds of them. It's easier, 
you're

22:38.839 --> 22:52.377
going to interview Ed, so I'll let you talk to Ed 
about one of his experiences about the big,

22:53.369 --> 22:57.474
plumber or pipe fitter or whoever it was that 
wanted to talk to Cooper. But most of the time,

22:57.494 --> 23:12.091
we tried to deal with the students from the 
standpoint of that we're not denying you

22:57.494 --> 23:12.091
admission to Texas A&M. We're trying to provide 
you a way to be a graduate of Texas A&M. And in

23:17.397 --> 23:22.583
dealing with them, you didn't make everybody 
happy. But I'm not sure we made anybody extremely

23:22.850 --> 23:28.258
mad at us on the thing. We hoped that we could say, 
although you don't meet what we consider the

23:28.278 --> 23:37.752
proper requirements, there are certain things 
you can do. And at that time, we had the summer

23:37.792 --> 23:42.318
provisional program, as you may recall. And it 
gave us an out, in a sense. And I say an out. It gave

23:46.364 --> 23:52.553
the student another way to prove that they had 
ability, the determination, whatever it may take

23:53.157 --> 23:59.995
to come in and be successful at Texas A&M. And 
therefore we never quote denied anybody the right

24:03.118 --> 24:10.426
to come to Texas A&M in that sense. We said right now 
you don't meet the requirements. If you want to

24:13.909 --> 24:21.456
come to the summer provisional program you can 
come and meet the requirements of the provisional

24:13.909 --> 24:21.456
program and then you can enter on in in the fall. 
Could anybody go in the summer? At that time

24:23.758 --> 24:26.521
anybody could come in and enter the summer too. Now 
I'm realizing that It was impossible for some to

24:28.443 --> 24:37.757
come because of work situations and distance and 
other things, but otherwise the program was open

24:28.443 --> 24:37.757
to anybody who wanted to come. What did it take in 
the summer, what courses and grades, to survive

24:38.298 --> 24:44.067
for the fall?

24:47.392 --> 24:56.847
I want to say at that time that it took 12 hours and a 
2.5 average or I believe. Were there any courses

24:58.459 --> 25:01.263
that had to be included? Early on, I don't think 
there were. We did go to where we had to because we

25:04.106 --> 25:11.295
found that a lot of students were, some were taking 
it very difficult. Some advisors, let me put it

25:11.876 --> 25:25.112
this way, would assign a very difficult program 
for some, and some of them would provide, give them

25:11.876 --> 25:25.112
some what we considered easier courses, and they 
didn't think it was really fair to the students,

25:11.876 --> 25:25.112
nor did it give you the basis on which they might be 
successful. Early on, when I say early on, in 71

25:29.691 --> 25:36.178
when I went there, I think they could take any 12 
hours. It takes six hours a summer school session

25:36.559 --> 25:44.729
and had to, and I believe the figure, I don't know 
whether it's the 2.5 or the 3. 3 sounds a little high

25:44.749 --> 25:46.130
to me. I think it's a 2.5. And eventually,

25:47.492 --> 25:56.162
maybe it's forgetful, but I think English and math 
one of each was included eventually there were

25:56.598 --> 26:20.462
some core courses that had to be and then there were 
some others that could be added in from a select

25:56.598 --> 26:20.462
group but we we got away from just a wide open 
selection of courses so uh and as i recall about

25:56.598 --> 26:20.462
half of the students who tried it in the summer made 
it Then, of that half that survived in the summer,

26:21.488 --> 26:31.419
what is your recollection of how well they did 
toward graduation?

26:34.363 --> 26:37.687
Again, I want to say about half of those made it on to 
graduation. So they didn't do quite as well as

26:38.808 --> 26:44.515
those that were fully admitted to begin with? I 
don't think they did quite as well, but a lot of them

26:44.695 --> 26:50.922
came through that route and did graduate.

26:51.779 --> 26:58.309
And it was hard to tell because some of those who 
didn't make it then eventually may have come back

26:51.779 --> 26:58.309
as transfer students too.

27:02.215 --> 27:09.586
In those early days was there any particular 
geographic pattern to our enrollment sources?

27:10.447 --> 27:11.849
Where did the students come from? Well I think

27:11.889 --> 27:18.259
for the most part They came from the larger 
metropolitan areas, there were just more

27:19.133 --> 27:23.017
students there. But there were, again, at one time 
I can remember, seemed like maybe two or three

27:23.037 --> 27:32.265
counties didn't have anybody from it. But most 
counties in the state of Texas would have one, two,

27:32.285 --> 27:40.172
three, or more students come from there. They were 
occasionally, they were, there were always a

27:40.192 --> 27:46.558
certain few, I'm not sure how many people lived in 
the county, but there were, It did pretty well

27:47.045 --> 27:58.042
spread all over the state, but again, you had more 
students coming from Harris County, Bexar

27:47.045 --> 27:58.042
County, and Dallas and Tarrant Counties. Don't I 
remember Harris maybe 20-25% of the student body?

28:01.768 --> 28:02.789
Probably so. Harris was the biggest. It always 
showed up in the figures that you had a lot from

28:04.853 --> 28:09.019
Brazos County. But I think that's because a lot of 
them listed this as their home. Therefore, it

28:14.406 --> 28:17.170
showed up at more students here. There just 
weren't that many students to come from Bassett

28:17.210 --> 28:25.622
County, although it was maybe third or fourth in 
numbers as far as total enrollment was concerned.

28:25.642 --> 28:25.842
All right. Still on admissions, y'all would get 
these applications. And as far as you recall,

28:29.908 --> 28:37.158
early on, what was the turnaround time in 
notification? Do you remember in those pre-

28:39.948 --> 28:40.809
Computer days? I don't remember. It wasn't very 
good, I'm sure, though. The time we got them in, got

28:47.136 --> 28:56.666
the things together and everything, I don't 
remember the procedure we used as far as getting

28:47.136 --> 28:56.666
the information back to them, whether it had been 
admitted or not. But pretty slow as far as they were

28:56.726 --> 29:01.211
concerned, I would imagine. Do you remember any 
unusual situations where a student sent their

29:01.231 --> 29:09.280
seventh semester transcript with their 
application, but then when their eighth semester

29:09.530 --> 29:17.989
official transcript came in, that it had changed? 
Yeah, we had those occasions, and admission was

29:18.430 --> 29:29.614
conditioned on the fact that they, well, let's 
see, it was conditioned on the fact that they

29:18.430 --> 29:29.614
graduated from high school, so we had to, not only 
did we have to verify that they had the proper

29:31.231 --> 29:54.538
information based on seven and then we did it was 
based on seven semesters uh we had to go back then

29:31.231 --> 29:54.538
and get a report from the high school showing that 
they did graduate and we had a look you know some

29:31.231 --> 29:54.538
that didn't that were admitted but didn't 
graduate and therefore they were not eligible to

29:31.231 --> 29:54.538
come on the thing i don't recall I don't know that we 
even checked to see if they maintained a class

29:56.510 --> 30:01.875
rank. I think if they were admitted based on being 
in the top half, if they dropped to the third

30:01.895 --> 30:11.504
quarter, I don't think we paid any attention to it 
at that time. But we did pay it too close to the fact

30:11.524 --> 30:17.090
that they were a high school graduate because that 
was part of the admission requirement. And that

30:17.110 --> 30:24.897
was a real problem trying to get information in 
from counselors, schools, between June and

30:25.501 --> 30:29.266
middle of August when they started coming for 
their summer conferences. All right, now Ed

30:29.767 --> 30:33.573
Cooper would replace Mr. Heaton. Right, Ed 
replaced Mr. Heaton when he retired. In the early

30:36.557 --> 30:38.199
70s. In 73 possibly, something like that. All 
right, describe Ed then as the Dean of Admissions

30:41.544 --> 30:46.391
and Records. What was his normal work style and so 
forth?

30:56.838 --> 30:58.400
I enjoyed working with Ed. I never did work before 
Ed. I worked with him. Of course, having been a

31:04.209 --> 31:09.457
classmate of Ed, we had known each other for years 
on the thing. Ed was the dean and he coordinated the

31:10.739 --> 31:16.668
work of the admissions and the registrar. And 
although I can't speak for Bob, It was an excellent

31:21.172 --> 31:32.700
person to work for in the sense that he assumed I 
knew what I was supposed to do, and he let me do it.
