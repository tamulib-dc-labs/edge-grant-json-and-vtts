00:12.670 --> 00:16.294
This is Debbie Park interviewing Mr. D.A. 
Anderson at Mr. Anderson's home for the history of

00:16.474 --> 00:27.325
the City of College Station Project, September 
22nd, 1983, Side 1. I'd like

00:27.846 --> 00:35.734
to start with some background information. Where 
were you born? Well, I was born in Pittston,

00:39.265 --> 00:50.755
Pennsylvania, P-I-T-T-S-T-O-N. That's in the 
northeastern part of the state, in the anthracite

00:39.265 --> 00:50.755
region. It's a small town not far from the Pocono 
Mountains. And I spent quite a bit of time in the

00:55.259 --> 01:03.386
Poconos as a youth, you know, in the mountains. And 
that is one reason, I think, why my vocation trees

01:07.852 --> 01:08.713
today. Actually, I had two choices. One was 
medicine and the other was forestry. And they both

01:15.560 --> 01:29.814
had an equal tug in my heart, but apparently 
forestry won out and that was why I majored in

01:15.560 --> 01:29.814
forestry at Penn State University. Well, were 
your parents from Pennsylvania also My mother was

01:33.232 --> 01:40.899
born there, but my father came from Scarborough. 
And as a youth, he came while I guess he was about 21,

01:41.440 --> 01:46.905
22 years old. And came to the area, married my 
mother. And then he, well, he started to work in the

01:54.292 --> 02:00.538
coal fields.

02:02.729 --> 02:05.694
He rose to the rank of a foreman. He was a good 
worker. I, myself, also worked in the mines during

02:11.744 --> 02:15.250
the summer. Matter of fact, I carry a piece of coal 
right there. I've never wanted to take it out. That

02:21.340 --> 02:22.902
fell out of the roof one day. Oh, my gosh. And you can 
see it. Oh, you sure can. Oh, my gosh. But it reminds

02:29.797 --> 02:32.140
you of your... Well, that's why I carry it. It's a 
memento of when I worked in the forest. Well, you

02:36.985 --> 02:42.432
mentioned a minute ago about your education. You 
went to the university or something? No, not the

02:45.515 --> 02:46.296
university. I went to Penn State University. Penn 
State. Yeah. And majored in forestry? And majored

02:50.702 --> 02:52.764
in forestry. And did you work on... Well, 
actually, even though I went to Penn State, they

02:52.784 --> 02:59.652
had an area... in southern Pennsylvania where 
they screened out potential foresters. And the

03:07.697 --> 03:11.101
first two years you went all year. Summer you had 
your ordinary curriculum. You were staying in a

03:15.728 --> 03:27.824
dormitory and you were subject to firefighting, 
you were subject to anything that arose in terms of

03:15.728 --> 03:27.824
the forest. They had a nursery there, and you had to 
work in the nursery. In other words, they had two

03:33.370 --> 03:43.625
years, or anyone that went into forestry spent two 
years doing a lot of distasteful work. In other

03:43.645 --> 03:46.929
words, unless you liked it, you wouldn't stay. And 
they made it hard, both in coursework and

03:47.610 --> 03:51.576
otherwise. For example, we had what we called, in 
that day, Boy Scout merit patches. I mean, we were

03:57.962 --> 04:01.227
inclined to call them that. But we had to know, I 
think, 30 constellations in the sky. In other

04:05.734 --> 04:10.401
words, as people in forestry, this was part of it. 
We had to know every, we called them bugs, insects.

04:14.455 --> 04:42.555
that were flying around the campus or you know to 
identify all the insects that were common to the

04:14.455 --> 04:42.555
forest area or the city common names and 
scientific names this was on the side we had to know

04:14.455 --> 04:42.555
every rock you know a fellow professor pull up a 
rock or pick up a rock in the area and we had to know

04:14.455 --> 04:42.555
the type of rock this was all a prelude to other 
formal education too. We had to know, we had to have

04:45.726 --> 04:53.355
leaf collections, we had to have grass 
collections, we had to know the sounds of all the

04:45.726 --> 04:53.355
birds. We had to know all the birds. In other words, 
they were making environmentalists really out of

04:56.559 --> 05:04.308
us. Is the education different today? Oh yes, by 
far, right. And even when you When I took the civil

05:12.100 --> 05:18.950
service to get into federal civil service, it 
lasted three days. And I had to know how to put a

05:20.151 --> 05:24.438
telephone together and take it apart. I had to know 
telephone lines, transposition, because being

05:25.259 --> 05:33.130
in the Forest Service, well, you had to do with 
communications. So we didn't have radios in these

05:33.991 --> 05:36.895
days. So you had to know the communication system. 
And they just threw everything at you. And as I

05:44.902 --> 05:55.239
said, I think there were 91 starting out in our 
class, and only seven graduated. Oh my God. Yeah.

05:56.882 --> 06:04.074
Well, would you say that you gained more 
information than what they do today? Oh yeah, by

06:04.815 --> 06:06.137
far. I doubt seriously any of them would know the 
birds or could go outside and call any

06:06.607 --> 06:15.735
constellation any season of the year. You know, 
where is north? And things of this nature. And

06:20.319 --> 06:24.402
engineering, why they just stacked it on and 
stacked it on. I could lay out railroad curves in my

06:24.422 --> 06:29.947
freshman year, almost in my sleep. We had to go out 
and estimate the ties, the number of ties per mile.

06:36.813 --> 06:44.100
You know, on the railroad track, everything, and 
at the bridge, make bridge designs.

06:44.200 --> 06:48.764
It's amazing, the training they put you through in 
the early days. And even then, you know, I had to

06:49.024 --> 06:57.773
have two years of Latin before I, in high school, 
before they would accept me at the university.

06:57.793 --> 07:03.058
Well, I'm in favor of that type of an education. 
It's a very well-rounded type. Oh, yeah. How did

07:06.192 --> 07:11.861
you get involved in the Texas Forest Service? 
Well, I started out in Pennsylvania. Following

07:17.511 --> 07:29.230
graduation, I worked with the then Division of 
Plant Industry in the U.S. Department of

07:17.511 --> 07:29.230
Agriculture. This was in the control of a disease 
that affects white pine, a tree, white pine. And

07:40.664 --> 07:47.631
the alternate host of this disease is what is 
called ribes, R-I-B-E-S. It's a currant or a

07:48.312 --> 07:50.294
gooseberry. Maybe you like them, I don't know. Do 
you ever eat currants or gooseberries? Okay.

07:59.230 --> 08:13.328
With this alternate host, I mean the disease 
spreads from the currant or gooseberry to the

07:59.230 --> 08:13.328
pine, where it produces whole postules on the tree 
and eventually will kill the tree. And the only way

08:14.049 --> 08:22.500
to allow the tree to grow is to get rid of that 
alternate host, which is the ribes. So I was

08:22.520 --> 08:23.922
detailed. to travel all over the state of 
Pennsylvania making recommendations in CCC

08:24.357 --> 08:36.395
camps for the control of the ribies. And I was doing 
that when the opportunity came up to come to Texas

08:36.415 --> 08:46.430
with the U.S. Forest Service. So I came with the 
U.S. Forest Service. To me, I mean, just coming to

08:50.536 --> 08:52.980
Texas You know, that was just, that was a thing. I 
mean, that was great to me. And being, you know,

08:59.026 --> 09:04.232
somewhat of a pioneer anyhow, I thought this was 
great. So I came down to Texas, and when I came here,

09:04.292 --> 09:15.184
I had passed a civil service exam, but they didn't 
have any civil service openings. So I was working

09:15.204 --> 09:22.933
in the CCC program and other programs of the Forest 
Service without really a... civil service, you

09:23.538 --> 09:28.925
know, I wasn't in a civil service job. All of them 
were filled up. But then there was an opening

09:32.290 --> 09:41.662
occurred up in Channing and Stratford in the soil 
conservation service.

09:41.682 --> 09:43.685
So my wife and I bundled up. It was in the middle of 
the summer. And we went up there to Channing and

09:47.429 --> 09:50.033
Stratford. I don't know whether you have ever been 
up there in July. You could just see that, you know,

09:53.272 --> 09:59.238
that heat emanate from that ground. There were no 
trees. You know, it was just a desolate area. So I

10:06.144 --> 10:10.328
turned around and came back to the piney woods of 
East Texas. I was at that time in Lufkin. Well then

10:14.052 --> 10:19.217
when I came back, there was an opening in the Texas 
Forest Service. So I wanted something a little bit

10:22.162 --> 10:27.328
more permanent than to be an employee out here. Had 
I stayed, everything would have worked out all

10:27.768 --> 10:30.311
right. But I was taking a chance because all the 
appointed offices were filled up. So I went with

10:37.259 --> 10:44.588
the Texas Forest Service, which is a part of the A&M 
system. And having gone with them, well, I stayed

10:44.608 --> 10:49.333
with them for that period. And were you stationed 
in College Station? No, I started out really in

10:53.492 --> 10:56.676
Lufkin. With the Texas Forest Service? With the 
Texas Forest Service and I was there through 38 and

10:57.658 --> 11:08.354
then came over here and have been here ever since. 
And was there a time that you became involved with

11:08.374 --> 11:15.865
the educational program of the Texas Forest 
Service? Yeah, that's right. Well, that came

11:17.267 --> 11:19.270
later. yeah well yeah there was established in 
Texas

11:19.739 --> 11:49.037
well we had a part in it I guess

11:19.739 --> 11:49.037
a committee for conservation education it was 
eventually sponsored by the Texas Education

11:19.739 --> 11:49.037
Agency and I was named to this particular 
committee by Edgar, who was then the head of the

11:50.114 --> 11:58.228
education department in Austin. And I served on 
that committee for years and years and years.

12:03.496 --> 12:09.827
Actually, I was president of the appointed group 
for two terms. And every summer, I went up to

12:11.512 --> 12:18.481
various colleges and universities throughout 
the state of Texas. I really miss it, you know,

12:20.944 --> 12:32.919
today, working with in-service and pre-service 
teachers in the area of conservation education

12:20.944 --> 12:32.919
resource use. My particular field was plants, 
grass, trees, you know, any green thing. And then

12:39.693 --> 12:42.856
there was one that dealt with oil and gas. There was 
one with soils and one with wildlife, for example.

12:48.142 --> 12:53.327
And I would go into the classroom or auditorium. I 
had an experience there, too.

12:57.671 --> 13:00.594
And then work with the teachers. Now, it all 
depended on the particular program at the

13:00.694 --> 13:04.198
university. Sometimes I would go and lecture for 
most of the day and then be available the following

13:04.600 --> 13:19.240
day or maybe that afternoon for the development of 
work units, teaching units that were used in the

13:04.600 --> 13:19.240
classroom. Well, what

13:20.601 --> 13:26.389
years were you talking about that you were doing 
this?

13:33.001 --> 13:42.473
Oh, they

13:33.001 --> 13:42.473
were in the 60s and 70s, yeah. Oh,

13:42.874 --> 13:49.082
yeah.

13:50.403 --> 13:55.650
Yeah,

13:50.403 --> 13:55.650
just like the Extension Service. Any extension 
service throughout Texas? No, no, no. Extension

13:59.682 --> 14:02.585
service is just like the Forest Service. In other 
words, it is part of the system. Of the A&M system?

14:10.814 --> 14:11.174
Of the A&M system. Is there an extension service 
of, say... No, there's an extension service.

14:13.877 --> 14:18.141
Agricultural Extension Service is a different 
group, a different organization. Then there's

14:18.802 --> 14:21.064
the Engineering Extension Service. And see, the 
fireman's training course, fireman's training

14:22.023 --> 14:30.793
comes under engineering extension. Then there's 
engineering experiment station. But the Texas

14:34.898 --> 14:41.645
Forest Service or the whole state of Texas is part 
of the university. Of A&M? Yeah. I didn't realize

14:42.386 --> 14:44.388
that. Yeah. Well, then, was 38 the year that you 
came to college here? It was late 38, 39, yeah. So

14:51.067 --> 14:54.552
you were here... The city started in 38. It was 39. I 
came just after the whole thing, you know, got

14:58.017 --> 15:02.865
started. Right, okay. So you were here quite a 
number of years before you... Oh, yeah, yeah,

15:04.207 --> 15:13.601
right. Well, why did you decide to go to the city 
council the first time? Well, some issues came up.

15:17.828 --> 15:23.755
A lot of the citizens,

15:17.828 --> 15:23.755
some issues came up. They weren't maybe, you know, 
worth shaking in the community. But they asked me

15:28.201 --> 15:35.469
if I would go before the council on their behalf and 
do thus and so, which I did. And

15:35.489 --> 15:40.816
it became a habit. If anything else came up, well, 
Andy, why don't you go? You're our, you know, our

15:43.739 --> 15:45.962
representative. So finally came around to an 
election, and they said, well, you'd be better on

15:47.562 --> 15:52.187
the council. You know what I mean. Rather than 
going before the council, you can represent us

15:53.969 --> 15:58.755
better. So with that in mind, I did run with their 
support for the council. Were these mainly

16:03.600 --> 16:05.423
neighbors? Oh, yeah. All of College Hills and all 
around, yeah. Well, when you got on the council

16:09.618 --> 16:22.130
those first couple of years, did you have anything 
that you

16:09.618 --> 16:22.130
were really interested in working on or a project 
that you were interested in starting? Well, the

16:24.132 --> 16:39.287
main issue at that time among the people, I think, 
in most of the subdivisions were the subdivision

16:24.132 --> 16:39.287
regulations, the deed restrictions.

16:41.647 --> 16:48.895
These developers had these deed restrictions, 
and they had them registered in court. They were

16:50.037 --> 16:53.781
all nice, and you ran them over, and they were just 
great. I mean, the distance between buildings

16:54.182 --> 17:01.831
will be 10 feet, and no one will do this or that or the 
other thing. But then you found that they didn't

17:02.812 --> 17:07.317
adhere to that themselves. You know what I mean. 
When they put up a house, they didn't adhere to some

17:08.546 --> 17:12.131
of this. And then the city, for a while, got to the 
point, this is one reason why I got involved, was,

17:13.512 --> 17:28.211
well, now, for example, the deed restrictions 
said 10 feet between your property line and your

17:13.512 --> 17:28.211
house. It had to be on both sides, which made for 20 
feet, which I like, personally. But the city

17:34.599 --> 17:37.523
regulation was 5 feet. That means that somebody 
could live 10 feet away. You open your blind in the

17:41.307 --> 17:46.955
morning, somebody, you know what I mean. So we had 
some problems here. And the city was willing to go

17:52.563 --> 18:03.358
ahead and allow somebody to build a house on the lot 
and build it almost to the property line. So this

18:03.378 --> 18:07.864
was really a problem that we had to fight in the 
early days. Now, a lot of this, you know, stems from

18:08.502 --> 18:19.962
who was on the council, you know, not necessarily 
when it started because they were primarily

18:08.502 --> 18:19.962
university people. But boy, yeah, I hate to 
mention his name, but I could tell you a lot of

18:19.982 --> 18:26.273
things. Well, I'm going to take that. All right. 
Well, if you, whatever you want to say, you can hang

18:30.912 --> 18:35.992
out later. Don't feel like it's something that 
will be in a record.

18:44.362 --> 18:49.932
That was really, I mean, in the early days, this was 
a concern to people, you know. Well, the city did

18:49.952 --> 18:55.121
have subdivision ordinances. Were they allowing 
people to go past those? Well, no, they lived up to

18:58.447 --> 19:03.516
the city ordinance, but not to the deans. It 
wouldn't enforce the deans. Right. Well, they did

19:06.080 --> 19:07.962
after a while. When I got on the council, then we 
started to respect the deed restrictions.

19:18.874 --> 19:21.317
Oh, no, he wanted to make all the money he could. I 
mean, that was his primary. He didn't care if

19:23.980 --> 19:28.645
people had to park in the park. Excuse me. So the 
people who were interested in real estate, I

19:31.477 --> 19:37.583
guess, were into selling, buying real estate. 
Well, they were selling homes or building homes.

19:43.669 --> 19:44.309
You know what I mean? They didn't particularly 
care about regulations. And this is what prompted

19:47.232 --> 19:56.742
me, really, to get into

19:47.232 --> 19:56.742
city politics. And then I served for six years. And 
I figured, well, now that's enough. I'll just get

20:03.367 --> 20:04.228
out. So I made up my mind that I'd just drop out. And 
then, well, why, Andy, why can't you serve two

20:09.095 --> 20:15.504
years on planning and zoning? I mean, that isn't, 
well, that was worse almost. So I served two years

20:20.030 --> 20:22.915
on planning and zoning. In the meantime, the 
people, particularly all the way back here,

20:28.666 --> 20:31.690
insisted then that I run for mayor. And I mean, I had 
up here on the hill. Well, they knew then if I got in,

20:35.916 --> 20:42.325
you know, they'd have some, they could knock on my 
door and have some control. So, yeah, so then I

20:43.266 --> 20:56.665
served six years on the council, two years on 
planning and zoning, and then five years as mayor.

20:57.421 --> 21:05.993
Well, when you first got on the council, Mayor 
Lankford had been the mayor for quite a few years. A

21:06.013 --> 21:07.435
good many years, right. And he was also

21:07.455 --> 21:16.327
continuing for some more time. And can you 
describe the philosophy that he employed as

21:16.347 --> 21:20.733
mayor, what he was interested in? Well, we were all 
interested, I think. We were interested. a very

21:26.463 --> 21:31.711
conservative, at that time, council. Federal aid 
was brought in the land. And all of us, of course,

21:36.579 --> 21:42.027
serving on that council, came up through the 
Depression.

21:44.531 --> 21:46.274
I did myself as a boy. You know what I mean. I was a 
product of the Depression. I went to school at the

21:50.821 --> 21:54.006
university through the Depression. I know what 
the school of hard knocks is. I came up on the other

21:57.548 --> 21:59.631
side of the track. What I mean by that, I never had 
much as a child because of, you know what I mean, the

22:01.374 --> 22:12.490
economic conditions existing. And I scratched 
around for everything to go to the university. And

22:17.037 --> 22:21.844
if I could, well, I knew others could do the same 
thing. I did everything. You know what I mean? Shoe

22:24.533 --> 22:29.177
laces, shoe polish, I did everything to get a 
little bit. I ate a lot of bread for meals, too. I

22:31.639 --> 22:37.505
mean, I didn't... You know, bread was maybe my 
breakfast or dinner, see? You know what I mean? You

22:39.827 --> 22:40.828
just don't have it. You have to get by, and you work 
harder to get another nickel to do something else.

22:46.393 --> 22:51.718
And I went through the hard way, and I think 
everybody on that council... you know, had that

22:52.255 --> 23:03.787
spirit of, you know, if you pull yourself up by your 
heels, there were a lot of federal projects in the

22:52.255 --> 23:03.787
area we didn't particularly want. And we thought, 
well, we ought to earn them ourselves. Do it

23:06.250 --> 23:07.791
ourselves. Let's not call on the federal 
government to do it. Well, this was, I think this

23:12.977 --> 23:20.845
was the theme during most of Lankford's tenure.

23:21.162 --> 23:24.827
Then I think the thinking began, I myself changed. 
You know what I mean? Well, now here is Brian

23:26.489 --> 23:28.512
getting it. Here is everybody all over the state 
getting it. We're sending our taxes, and we're not

23:32.617 --> 23:37.183
getting anything in return. So I think after life, 
then there was a change in the philosophy on the

23:38.485 --> 23:50.781
council, whereby then we'll go out after some of 
these things. and i know the sewage disposal plant

23:51.723 --> 24:21.662
i know was one and of course the fellow that was 
heading up hued at that time was an aggie that was an

23:51.723 --> 24:21.662
easy one we we had some disappointments 
personally i have

23:51.723 --> 24:21.662
we were well i'll say it but i had arranged to have 
the this creek down here, channelized from the

24:21.929 --> 24:30.602
apartments clear through to McCarter Creek as a 
federal project. Now this was done through a

24:30.622 --> 24:47.907
number of good friends

24:30.622 --> 24:47.907
in the Soil Conservation Service and otherwise, 
clear through to the Washington office.

24:47.927 --> 24:48.628
This was in the Washington office and had been 
approved, you know, now my application had been

24:49.047 --> 25:10.571
put on top of the pile through some friends and had 
been approved and was ready to leave Washington

24:49.047 --> 25:10.571
and come down whereby this whole area would have 
been channelized. And Glenn Cook out at the VVDC

25:15.406 --> 25:44.383
raised the question that it was not approved at the 
local level and therefore had to be thrown out and

25:15.406 --> 25:44.383
he ruined that whole project because of his 
attitude towards that there was no way that you

25:15.406 --> 25:44.383
could locally improve it at this point well yeah i 
could have gone through but then i would have been

25:15.406 --> 25:44.383
in the bottom of the pile see i ran through french to 
get in the top of the pile in washington And Eddie

25:45.258 --> 25:49.306
called me up and said, Andy, what's this all about? 
Or, you know, to help me rather than just turn it

25:49.326 --> 25:54.175
down. And so, did the city ever channelize it? No. 
No, I didn't think so. No. You know, it's just plain

26:00.988 --> 26:05.657
ditch now. We'd have had all them federal funds 
just to... Well,

26:08.562 --> 26:18.819
it would be a HUD project.

26:18.839 --> 26:30.638
But it's just one of these things that you wish that 
something else had transpired, because that

26:18.839 --> 26:30.638
would have been, in terms of drainage, Even today, 
in a way, it hasn't totally drained the way it

26:30.972 --> 26:41.002
should be

26:30.972 --> 26:41.002
drained. Well, it's a shame that the project would 
have been so worthwhile, and it's inhibited

26:41.062 --> 26:53.094
because it's here for one of the wrong reasons, I 
guess. Right, right. That's not in the record

26:53.535 --> 26:58.260
either, I don't think. Oh, is that right? I hadn't 
read about that. What did you see as advantages or

27:01.465 --> 27:13.718
disadvantages for the city of College Station 
having a mayor, the same

27:01.465 --> 27:13.718
mayor, for 24 years? You served many years. Well, I 
didn't, Lankford was, yeah, I served many years

27:14.639 --> 27:23.668
with Lankford.

27:25.710 --> 27:29.734
You know, during his tenure, the city was in the 
formative stages. developing. If you look back

27:33.448 --> 27:40.074
and see some of the old ordinances that were drawn 
up, they're quite interesting. They wouldn't

27:40.094 --> 27:46.300
hold water legally today, you know, the way some of 
them were drawn up. But it was a formative

27:46.320 --> 27:50.103
government.

27:53.106 --> 27:59.552
I think

27:53.106 --> 27:59.552
it was university controlled. for the most part, 
until the boyhood got in, the faction got in. It had

28:06.743 --> 28:07.584
to be. It was just like the school, you know. The 
school was on the campus at that time, and then it

28:09.126 --> 28:16.335
moved over to the chicken coops, as we called it.

28:21.763 --> 28:24.046
I don't know what else to say. I think that...

28:29.401 --> 28:46.958
Well,

28:29.401 --> 28:46.958
everybody, everyone was really, I think, very 
well satisfied with the form of government, for

28:29.401 --> 28:46.958
the most part. Ernest never, he went in each 
election. Sure, he had some people against him,

28:51.283 --> 28:55.527
which is natural. But he went in with a fair-sized 
majority, and people were satisfied in that

28:55.777 --> 29:02.462
period. see the number, you know, the population. 
You know, when I came here, this was just nothing

29:05.857 --> 29:11.446
but a cotton field, you know, for the most part. 
This is one of the oldest houses in the area. In the

29:14.710 --> 29:15.331
area? Yeah. And when did you build this? This was 
built in late 37 and 38 by Ross Sherwood, who was

29:18.396 --> 29:28.371
head of the poultry department. And I bought the 
house from him. For $4,000. Oh, my God. And that was

29:34.039 --> 29:35.160
a lot of money. $4,000. No, I've added a lot to it. 
You know, I've added a room in the back here and

29:41.128 --> 29:54.546
added still further on in the back so that when the 
children can come, like, you know, they have their

29:41.128 --> 29:54.546
own bath and accommodations. A lot more room. Oh, 
yeah. Yeah. Well, when you were on the council, it

29:56.122 --> 30:06.454
seems as though a lot of time was spent working out 
street repair and street building. Do you

30:06.474 --> 30:08.456
remember? Oh, yeah. There were those that wanted 
to, some few, that wanted to, wanted the city to

30:10.659 --> 30:24.475
issue, well, they wanted to get a big bond issued to 
pave all the streets. And again, that

30:29.235 --> 30:32.039
conservatism in us showed up. And we got our 
pencils out, and we figured we could do a better job

30:33.541 --> 30:40.029
on a pay-as-you-go basis. And you probably read 
about that in whatever you read. And we went to the

30:46.417 --> 30:54.647
people in total support of a pay-as-you-go 
program. and they endorsed it by an overwhelming

30:55.235 --> 31:02.082
majority. I don't think we needed to spend the 
money,

31:02.282 --> 31:11.992
you know what I mean, millions of dollars just to 
repair all the streets. I think we did a very

31:13.554 --> 31:19.740
creditable job the other way and saved the city 
much money. As you look back, do you think the

31:20.463 --> 31:24.367
decision was the best? Right, I do, right. Do you 
think the city might have gotten into a debt that

31:26.689 --> 31:33.536
is... Well, a debt there, yeah. And of course, 
you've got to keep in mind the philosophy of the...

31:33.556 --> 31:37.961
You know what I mean? We went through a depression. 
I know what a dollar is. And today, well, I'm going

31:43.026 --> 31:46.690
to save that dollar for the city. And then 
throughout my regime, when I was mayor, I squeezed

31:47.362 --> 31:56.819
everything that I could to get a maximum out of that 
dollar. Because I prided myself on trying to get a

31:58.522 --> 32:06.075
maximum return on every dollar we spent. And 
unless I figured we were going to get a return, that

32:06.095 --> 32:11.665
was something else.

32:14.125 --> 32:26.317
Also, there was a period when the city was trying to 
build an underpass at Crompton Market Road 60 in

32:14.125 --> 32:26.317
Wilbur. And it began in the 50s. They started 
talking about it, but it wasn't completed until

32:28.319 --> 32:33.604
the early 60s. I was wondering if you had any 
thoughts as to why it was so delayed and what

32:33.624 --> 32:40.791
happened with those. You mean the overpass? 
Overpass, right. Yeah. At the railroad track.

32:45.597 --> 32:48.061
Yeah, because you don't mean the one at Boyette. 
Yeah. At University Drive? Right. Yeah. Well,

32:51.826 --> 33:03.663
that's the one where I used the

32:51.826 --> 33:03.663
voting procedure to get him to vote in favor of 
something. This had come up at several meetings.

33:06.867 --> 33:07.749
You've read the minutes. It came up. several 
meetings in an attempt to get Boyette and his

33:09.678 --> 33:20.890
followers to endorse, you know, the underpass. 
And he wouldn't do it because of the condemnation

33:20.910 --> 33:25.415
procedures against his land. And he did not think 
they were fair and all kinds of things. The minutes

33:30.360 --> 33:32.823
are replete with this information. And the judge, 
Judge Bill Davis at the time, He was chomping at the

33:39.766 --> 33:50.396
bits, and the highway department had the money, 
and they were ready to go, and everything was held

33:39.766 --> 33:50.396
up because of the situation. And that is when we, 
well, we arranged to at least try Robert's Rules of

33:50.416 --> 34:00.766
Water. And we were fortunate in raising it two 
degrees and then coming back twice, or coming back

34:08.690 --> 34:36.013
quickly and uh in the process you know unless you 
keep your mind about you you don't know what what's

34:08.690 --> 34:36.013
going on so we got him to vote in favor so up until 
this point the council had not approved no city

34:08.690 --> 34:36.013
taking part in in the condemnation no no no he held 
everything up And it was through this Robert

34:36.787 --> 34:43.635
Shultz Award that we got him mixed up. Well, was he 
afraid that he wouldn't get enough money from the

34:43.655 --> 34:47.319
condemnation group? Oh, yeah. He wanted a lot 
more. Oh, I see. He wanted a lot more, and they

34:50.042 --> 34:52.845
wouldn't allow any more. See, they met, and the 
condemnation group met, and made this award. And

35:00.153 --> 35:04.077
that was really the tops. They

35:04.597 --> 35:12.725
made him an offer and everything else, yeah. I 
forget, you know, the details, but he was well

35:12.825 --> 35:24.516
aware of what he was going to get, and it was beyond 
what other people normally thought was

35:12.825 --> 35:24.516
justified. But he, you know, he had that, well, 
cold beer, Oh, yeah. It was taken down to put in. Oh,

35:38.484 --> 35:40.027
he didn't want to see that taken down? Well, yeah. 
He said that was worth a million dollars. You know,

35:43.893 --> 35:46.156
all them kind of stories.

35:49.281 --> 36:01.519
For example, we only paid $175,000 to Louis Mays 
for the intersection down here at University and

35:49.281 --> 36:01.519
Highway 6. you know, right down across Caddy 
Corner from the golf station. And that was a more

36:06.594 --> 36:14.085
valuable piece of land than, boy, yes, you know, a 
little track up there. But I thought he was

36:14.105 --> 36:20.915
offering more than enough for what he had there. 
And then when you realize what he did get out of the

36:20.935 --> 36:31.810
churches and the business people, you know, and 
how he got to the students, I... I'm just full of

36:32.566 --> 36:35.250
stories. Well, I had heard that there's a lot of 
things that happened also, building very, very

36:35.270 --> 36:47.207
small apartments, I think, for students that 
didn't meet the restrictions or didn't meet the

36:35.270 --> 36:47.207
conditions. No. Well, see, this is when I bucked 
him on this. This is really what started this

36:49.250 --> 36:52.495
matter in the soup. Oh, I see. In other words, he 
wanted to build one apartment unit there using the

36:53.817 --> 37:01.408
street as a parking area. You know, building the 
apartment right out to the street. And I said, I

37:06.854 --> 37:10.762
wouldn't go along with that. He ought to provide 
for off-street parking.

37:16.575 --> 37:18.199
And that's really started. Was that after, when 
was that? When I was mayor. And was he on council?

37:28.526 --> 37:29.207
Yeah. He was still on council? Yeah, that was the 
prelude, you know, to a lot of this other... Okay.

37:36.118 --> 37:40.164
How did the council, when you were on council, feel 
about planning? I know that the graduate period

37:40.184 --> 37:45.773
plan was put into effect, but how effective was 
that?

37:49.600 --> 38:09.513
Well,

37:49.600 --> 38:09.513
this was an attempt on the part of the county 
highway department and the two cities to evolve a

37:49.600 --> 38:09.513
long-range program, a plan that we could follow.

38:10.235 --> 38:15.844
Any plan, however, is subject to revision. This is 
my comment with some certain people at the

38:16.364 --> 38:21.595
university now. It's all right to say that now the 
city's going to grow this way and therefore I

38:22.237 --> 38:29.552
should be planned accordingly. But then suppose 
the city starts to grow this way, what are you going

38:29.572 --> 38:33.561
to do? After your plan is, you know. You can't get a 
plan that is 100% perfect. We had this particular

38:42.319 --> 38:51.592
plan and I thought it did us very well for at least 
five years or more. And then there was a lot of

38:51.612 --> 39:00.985
interest in gender within the two cities to make 
their own comprehensive plans. So, actually,

39:01.572 --> 39:07.678
Brad's area plan was not... Well, we used it as a 
guide. I think I still have copies of it around

39:07.778 --> 39:11.221
someplace. They haven't stopped the city, I 
guess. Well, I haven't seen it in mine, but I have.

39:17.006 --> 39:18.468
Well, I don't think I threw them out. I think I still 
have, because I was vice president of the board

39:18.488 --> 39:29.418
when the last of them met. And... But it was a 
forerunner to what the cities eventually then,

39:31.070 --> 39:40.319
you know, took over and decided to expand on their 
own. Now there was, as you probably know, there was

39:40.819 --> 39:50.848
some hard feelings between Bryan and College 
Station over the years. And it is still evident

39:51.109 --> 39:53.271
today. I still run into it. But I can cite well These 
things didn't help the community grow together,

40:00.533 --> 40:11.608
you know, county-wise in two cities.

40:11.628 --> 40:21.923
Well,

40:11.628 --> 40:21.923
the plan was good for what it was intended to be. And 
it served as a guide to our city for two years. Oh, I

40:26.569 --> 40:28.752
say over five years. And then we began to expand on 
it on our own and develop our own long-range plan.

40:35.319 --> 40:38.504
And the city of Bryan attempted to do the same 
thing. One divorced pretty much from the other.

40:41.168 --> 40:54.147
Now they may say that they tried to coordinate, and 
they did to some extent, but

40:41.168 --> 40:54.147
each of them I think went off on their own in many 
areas. I remember For example, we had a fellow come

40:56.069 --> 41:05.679
in here and set up a taxi, a stand, across from 
Ramona. And the radio controls of his office, very

41:05.700 --> 41:11.986
nice, one-man outfit. And he called me one day and 
he was arrested in crime. I said, arrested for

41:17.192 --> 41:18.473
what? He said, because I can't take passengers 
into crime from the airport. And I said, you don't

41:26.377 --> 41:27.678
say. So I called up Brian, and I just told him, the 
mayor and Brian, that in fact, tomorrow morning, I

41:27.739 --> 41:47.401
gave orders to our police to stop every Brian taxi 
that came into College Station because of

41:27.739 --> 41:47.401
violation of our ordinance.

41:47.421 --> 41:48.963
And they said, Eddie, what are they violating? I 
said, they're violating our ordinance. That's

41:51.505 --> 41:52.907
all I'm going to say. And they think that tomorrow 
morning they'll do it. Now, I'm doing this because

41:55.436 --> 42:01.805
our man was thus and so and so. And boy, they got on 
the phone and all of them down there. Well, but the

42:07.213 --> 42:09.857
next day it was all settled. That was when you were 
mayor? Yeah. Well, it was just one of the

42:12.040 --> 42:13.702
incidents. One of many, yeah. So the Brazos area 
plan was... a plan for the overall county? Is it

42:22.079 --> 42:23.762
like a transportation? Right, the highway 
department and all of them were involved. And

42:27.808 --> 42:31.233
hopefully it was to help the cities. The two cities 
and the county as a whole. Grow together. Grow

42:34.799 --> 42:36.501
together and plan together. But in fact they 
didn't. Well they didn't, not to the extent that

42:38.344 --> 42:42.891
they should have. To my knowledge, I don't know 
whether the Razzis Area Incorporation still

42:43.293 --> 42:49.241
exists or not. They had a charter, and I know I was 
vice president the last time we met, and the thing

42:49.261 --> 42:58.875
just naturally dissipated. Do you

42:58.895 --> 43:06.366
remember when it dissipated? I think it was, I 
guess it was, they started talking about it in the

43:06.386 --> 43:09.270
early 60s, and it lasted about five years. Oh yeah, 
yeah. and uh let's see what's the butler r.b butler

43:11.069 --> 43:37.566
the senior

43:11.069 --> 43:37.566
was uh president

43:11.069 --> 43:37.566
i think oh yeah we we were but uh And it eventually 
evolved. I think the stimuli, too, came from the

43:40.589 --> 43:48.157
university to do, you know, more planning. And the 
Planning and Zoning Commission then took a more

43:48.177 --> 43:54.764
active role than it had in the past. And that led, of 
course, to all the things that in late years

43:56.305 --> 44:04.954
developed, you know, in terms of planning.

44:10.047 --> 44:18.839
The previous years, I guess it was more of a 
competition with slow but steady growth. Yeah,

44:18.859 --> 44:19.760
that's right. It didn't have the growth that, you

44:19.780 --> 44:31.837
know, it was just, you get a slow growth. Then when 
we began really to expand and grow more at a faster

44:31.897 --> 44:39.227
pace, things changed. Yeah. To a great deal. You 
know, that's what this meeting was about today, in

44:42.006 --> 44:48.378
part.

44:48.518 --> 44:54.289
What's going to happen to this industrial country 
between you and I? Are you aware of it? The

44:55.150 --> 44:56.813
industrial development out there? Well, 
somebody's got wind, and it's going to be huge.

45:01.522 --> 45:01.722
Thank you.

45:15.640 --> 45:18.924
Oh, I'll have to be there. Well, I don't come for it. 
Oh, no, no, sir. I won't. Oh, and I don't write for

45:22.689 --> 45:27.496
the papers either. Well, there's no 
confidentiality about us here. But I am privy to a

45:29.479 --> 45:35.426
lot of stuff by a lot of people. The Telman thing. So 
when Andy, you know, it's off the record. Right.

45:41.214 --> 45:43.337
And because I respect him, I hear more. You know 
what I mean? I can get out of the courthouse And I

45:46.589 --> 45:52.918
start down with the girl down there, the secretary 
down there, you know, the commissioner. Chat with

45:52.938 --> 46:08.519
them all down there, you know, and they'd go in and 
think of getting the commissioner to go and go see

45:52.938 --> 46:08.519
the sheriff, who's a friend of mine, and then start 
upstairs, you know, chat with the JPs and the

45:52.938 --> 46:08.519
county judge, you know what I mean, and all the rest 
of them. And then drop at a bank or two and end up at

46:08.659 --> 46:11.763
Vermont Inn. Well, I'm pretty well filled up 
with... you know what's going on i'm gonna stop the

46:15.226 --> 46:23.886
tape on this side because i'm afraid you'll run out 
okay
