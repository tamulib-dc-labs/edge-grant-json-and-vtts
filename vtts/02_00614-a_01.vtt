WEBVTT

00:04.621 --> 00:05.783
up to it three times. Sounds now as if it's a 
rehearsal for a movie. Different story every

00:08.526 --> 00:10.129
time. Okay. That's the way historians do. We 
change the story with regularity. Start again

00:15.196 --> 00:17.278
with the Officer's Candidate School. Explain why 
that you were in Officer's Candidate School from

00:17.318 --> 00:20.663
40 to 42. Well, it was because I was performing my 
normal military service, which is a one and a half

00:20.743 --> 00:32.299
year period in Sweden, normally, during the war. 
It became longer. I was in for about three years.

00:40.563 --> 00:43.807
And it seemed to me to make the best out of that time. 
It would be most interesting to go to officer

00:44.748 --> 01:01.628
school, particularly if I was interested in the 
coast artillery, which combined the physical

00:44.748 --> 01:01.628
interest of ballistics and mathematics and also 
the contact with the sea. And the first contact

01:03.970 --> 01:10.238
with the sea then that you experienced was really 
from your home and not from the military? Oh yes, I

01:10.698 --> 01:27.298
grew up on the ocean, on the beautiful bay of the 
Baltic, which had very interesting natural

01:10.698 --> 01:27.298
features and therefore attracted my interest 
very much. What degrees did you receive from the

01:28.219 --> 01:32.104
University of Stockholm prior to the doctoral 
degree in science? Well, the way you work it in

01:35.114 --> 01:40.439
Scandinavia, first you take your bachelor's 
degree. And after that,

01:41.040 --> 01:51.971
work your way toward what corresponds more or less 
to a doctorate degree here, which is called

01:41.040 --> 01:51.971
licentiate degree. And for a thesis in that 
connection, I worked on the problem I found

01:53.593 --> 02:01.821
fascinating. namely studies of sedimentation in 
the past by using the type of deposit that occurs in

02:02.257 --> 02:31.690
the glacial strata around Scandinavia, where you 
can distinguish every single year and therefore

02:02.257 --> 02:31.690
establish a chronology and study processes on an 
absolute time basis. How do you distinguish every

02:32.041 --> 02:33.483
year? Does it fall in layers like, you mean like a 
tree reversed? Exactly like tree rings,

02:36.628 --> 02:54.758
essentially, because in spring you get the flood, 
the melting, and that gives rise to a specific type

02:36.628 --> 02:54.758
of more coarse grain deposit, and in winter and 
fall and winter, things slow down and the

02:36.628 --> 02:54.758
character of the sediment, chemical character of 
sediment is different. So therefore you get the

02:55.279 --> 02:58.504
kind of tree ring-like effect, and you can measure 
the thicknesses of these rings, and therefore

02:58.906 --> 03:19.204
seek to reconstruct exactly the

02:58.906 --> 03:19.204
different hydrologic conditions and metrologic 
conditions during each year, and also use this

02:58.906 --> 03:19.204
sequence as a timekeeper and measure things on an 
absolute time basis. Is that what began the

03:19.484 --> 03:23.267
Scandinavian's interest in deep sea drilling? I 
wouldn't say so. So the deposits of this kind were

03:28.167 --> 03:43.143
formed around the polar ice that covered 
Scandinavia

03:28.167 --> 03:43.143
during several ice ages. And it's the basis for 
establishing the whole chronology for the ice

03:43.324 --> 03:51.392
ages. And it gave me an interest, or it was an 
exponent of my interest, putting geological

03:57.800 --> 04:02.685
phenomena on an absolute quantitative basis. And 
with that background, it then became very

04:04.488 --> 04:13.618
interesting to go to the deep sea, where one knew 
that the sedimentation was much, much smaller.

04:13.658 --> 04:23.969
Instead of having a fraction of an inch for each 
year, the

04:13.658 --> 04:23.969
same thickness of sediment corresponded to many 
thousand years. So you have the chance to extend

04:24.570 --> 04:27.233
much, much further back in time. That's what 
fascinated me first with deep sea geology.

04:36.971 --> 04:46.379
Now,

04:36.971 --> 04:46.379
when was your first expedition that began to 
explore the sea in these terms, in terms of deep sea

04:36.971 --> 04:46.379
drilling?

04:49.282 --> 04:56.848
The first expeditions with that specific aim in 
mind were a series of of preliminary test

04:57.402 --> 05:11.624
expeditions in the North Sea and Skagerrak that 
were initiated by the, taken by the Oceanographic

04:57.402 --> 05:11.624
Institute in Göteborg. And I was lucky enough to 
participate in these and also in the final

05:13.507 --> 05:24.844
shakedown cruise to the Mediterranean. 
preceding the culmination of these efforts in the

05:25.702 --> 05:36.672
form of the Swedish deep-sea expedition with the 
Albatross, 1947 to 1948. So the first major effort

05:37.633 --> 05:51.566
preceding that was then the Skagerrak expedition 
to the Mediterranean, called the Skagerrak

05:37.633 --> 05:51.566
expedition because the ship's name was Skagerrak 
in this case, in 1946. And then you were on the

05:53.388 --> 05:54.949
Albatross in 1948. 47 to 48, 15 months. And then 
when you come back from the Albatross, then you

05:57.708 --> 06:05.997
work with the Swedish National Research Council 
in compiling your data? Well, the National

06:06.277 --> 06:24.818
Research Council provided essentially the 
fellowship support and research grant for the

06:06.277 --> 06:24.818
working up of the material collected from the East 
Pacific during the Albatross expedition, which I

06:25.118 --> 06:37.757
had been given the opportunity to use as a basis for 
my

06:25.118 --> 06:37.757
doctoral science thesis work. And when did you 
first make contact with Americans in terms of

06:37.777 --> 06:43.885
oceanographic work?

06:49.634 --> 06:51.336
It's hard to pinpoint the first time. It must have 
been in connection probably with the Skagerrak

06:55.190 --> 07:02.678
expedition, the preliminaries leading to the 
Albatross expedition. I developed

07:02.798 --> 07:21.417
correspondence with many people in this country 
who were interested in similar

07:02.798 --> 07:21.417
problems, particularly the people at Woods Hall 
and Lamont Geological Observatory, Morris Ewing

07:02.798 --> 07:21.417
there.

07:22.257 --> 07:30.807
several of the geologists in the country that were 
not necessarily associated with oceanography,

07:22.257 --> 07:30.807
but who were fascinated by these new 
possibilities. And finally, and foremost, with

07:31.528 --> 07:41.360
the staff here at Scripps Institutional 
Oceanography, Roger Revelle, and some of the

07:31.528 --> 07:41.360
other people working here. How did you manage to 
come to Scripps?

07:46.466 --> 07:50.931
It was a natural choice for what I thought would be a 
maybe half a year or a year post-doctoral work.

07:54.813 --> 08:08.513
After spending four years of working up the 
material from the East Pacific, which showed some

07:54.813 --> 08:08.513
very interesting previously unknown features, 
it was fascinating enough. So I wanted to at least

08:08.533 --> 08:12.078
devote a few more years to that problem. And the 
logical place, the center in the world for Pacific

08:19.379 --> 08:25.487
oceanographic studies was scripts, so that was an 
obvious choice. And whom did you contact here? One

08:28.671 --> 08:42.449
of the things that I found most inspiring in my 
thesis work was the thesis by Roger Revelle that

08:28.671 --> 08:42.449
had just then come out, quite strongly delayed 
again by the war. It worked on material collected

08:43.130 --> 08:47.395
by the American Carnegie expedition much 
earlier. But the material had not been worked up

08:48.067 --> 08:56.880
until

08:48.067 --> 08:56.880
he started investigating it. And his monograph on 
this is a very impressive piece of work, plus the

08:58.403 --> 09:14.587
fact that he was the man who inspired and 
controlled this place at the time made me write to

08:58.403 --> 09:14.587
him. And? Well,

09:18.492 --> 09:26.079
I didn't hear anything for, must have been half a 
year. I think I wrote him in Christmas, around

09:27.481 --> 09:33.226
Christmas time, 1940, 1951. I

09:33.867 --> 09:45.038
spent the Christmas together with my wife's 
family in Copenhagen and at the Bohr Institute.

09:46.119 --> 09:47.200
And Niels Bohr. further encouraged me to take that 
step and to go for a postdoctoral period here. He'd

09:55.872 --> 09:56.853
also heard about Scripps. But sometime in May the 
following year, I got a letter from a man whom I

09:59.517 --> 10:11.653
didn't know at that time, but who since then has 
become a great friend of mine, John D. Isaacs. And

10:12.033 --> 10:17.220
he explained to me in his letter, which was rather 
brief, that That day, a whole pile of papers had

10:17.943 --> 10:22.970
fallen down from the director's desk. And he was 
assistant to the director. And when he picked up

10:24.753 --> 10:28.418
the papers, he found my letter among them. And he 
felt he should answer some of the letters. And he

10:32.645 --> 10:33.386
picked mine. And his answer was, yes, why don't you 
come? That was all. I took that as an expression of

10:39.094 --> 10:47.106
the informality and directness of approach to 
science in the United States. and embarked on the

10:48.183 --> 10:50.225
trip over. Now, obviously you stayed here now. Why 
the change from research to professor? Was there

10:59.274 --> 11:01.816
any...? At the time when I came here, Scripps 
Institutional Oceanography was a kind of

11:01.836 --> 11:14.628
exceptional institution in the university and 
had very few faculty positions. They were very

11:17.140 --> 11:18.422
difficult to get. So Roger Revelle, who wanted to 
attract

11:18.923 --> 11:39.853
new scientists to the institution at a much higher 
rate than he could possibly get faculty positions

11:18.923 --> 11:39.853
for, used research staff positions for this 
purpose, and he offered such a position to me. And

11:40.954 --> 11:46.202
then you worked on research, and then from there 
you moved on into teaching when? Well, actually,

11:48.106 --> 11:52.693
there's no border between teaching and research 
in Scripps. I was teaching then insofar as we had

11:52.713 --> 11:58.020
contact with students around here. And I'm doing 
as much research after the change in title that you

11:58.821 --> 12:16.206
referred to, which

11:58.821 --> 12:16.206
didn't mean anything much in fact,

11:58.821 --> 12:16.206
just more of an administrative arrangement that 
you would call professor instead of research?

12:21.745 --> 12:26.791
Well, what I'm interested in is what appears to be 
biogeochemistry. Well, that thing stemmed from

12:26.811 --> 12:47.053
partly the fact that in much of my work in the ocean 
settlements, I had become to depend much on the

12:26.811 --> 12:47.053
record provided by the fossils of organisms. They 
provided a very rich, both chemical and

12:51.182 --> 12:59.650
paleontological evidence to tell you where you 
were and what had happened in the past. That is a

12:59.670 --> 13:09.058
characteristic feature of the EBC settlements, 
that they have a large proportion of tiny

12:59.670 --> 13:09.058
skeletons of microscopic animals and plants. So 
part of my geochemical work involved biological

13:09.078 --> 13:16.365
questions And when Roger Revelle kindly wanted to 
arrange for a professorship for me, he had to look

13:18.067 --> 13:28.578
for the best strategic way of doing it. And he had 
just succeeded in obtaining a million dollar

13:28.658 --> 13:40.009
grant from the Rockefeller Foundation for the 
rejuvenation of biology in script. And here he saw

13:40.029 --> 13:43.133
me as a biologist suddenly. And in order to to be 
able to incorporate this work I was doing in the

13:48.155 --> 13:53.903
general scheme of things. He therefore called the 
professorship

13:54.283 --> 14:02.074
of biogeochemistry. Well, when one reads the way 
you've approached work, it seems as if you begin as

14:02.394 --> 14:12.087
a generalist and then you become a specialist in 
And then you broaden out to be a journalist again.

14:15.445 --> 14:17.148
Is that a fair description of your career? I'm 
afraid that's the case, yes. Do you prefer to be a

14:19.111 --> 14:20.713
journalist? Is that the way you conceive of the 
role of a scientist? I think a scientist must renew

14:25.079 --> 14:27.082
himself all the time. And to renew yourself, you 
have to approach problems, new problems, and see

14:27.122 --> 14:34.793
problems in a different perspective. You must 
learn something about other branches of science.

14:40.012 --> 14:42.574
And that has a great danger that you spread 
yourself too thin. But the interesting thing is to

14:43.996 --> 14:45.838
learn new things. And I'm afraid if you get too 
specialized, then you might very well become an

14:46.238 --> 14:57.629
authority, but life will eventually become 
boring. Well, is oceanography especially suited

14:57.649 --> 15:06.817
to the sort of journalist, specialist, 
journalist approach as an academic discipline?

15:07.458 --> 15:07.538
Yes. is, and I would say earth sciences in general, 
because there's no barrier between

15:07.855 --> 15:32.057
oceanography, earth sciences in general, and 
from earth sciences in general, there's no

15:07.855 --> 15:32.057
barrier between that and space science, and the 
question of the laws that rule our universe or our

15:07.855 --> 15:32.057
solar system. These diffused borders make a very 
wide field, but it also makes it necessary to learn

15:32.341 --> 15:43.217
a large number of things. Let me offer an 
explanation before I ask the question. Many

15:46.362 --> 15:54.754
American oceanographers, if that's fair to say, 
began as meteorologists and moved into

15:46.362 --> 15:54.754
oceanography through submarine warfare 
training in one way or through meteorological

15:55.223 --> 15:58.687
work in the Air Force, the other. Who do you think 
are specifically? I'm thinking of people like

16:00.710 --> 16:07.437
Spellhouse, for example, who is only an American 
in terms of being naturalized, and those people

16:00.710 --> 16:07.437
who trained with the Air Force with him. And the 
other way, I'm thinking about people who moved out

16:08.459 --> 16:14.986
of oceanography and into space like yourself. 
Does there seem to be a blending together of

16:15.447 --> 16:18.751
atmosphere, space, and the ocean? That's 
certainly true, particularly for the people who

16:20.573 --> 16:23.897
deal with... The physics of the ocean, the motion 
of ocean currents, there is no particular

16:24.569 --> 16:38.574
principle difference between the motion of the 
fluid that forms atmosphere and the motion of the

16:24.569 --> 16:38.574
fluid that forms the ocean. And if you can treat 
one, you have the tools for treating the other. So

16:45.326 --> 16:48.973
there's often a blend of atmospheric and and 
oceanic sciences among these people. Ross Bue,

16:52.205 --> 16:58.493
Walter Munk, John Isaacs, you see many others. 
Now, is this what led you to turn your attention

16:58.513 --> 17:04.220
towards space? What I'm trying to find out is what 
specifically led you from the oceans to space. Oh,

17:08.825 --> 17:10.988
I'd always been interested in that. And again, it 
came much from the work of particularly One of my

17:19.700 --> 17:43.526
ancestors, back in the 1870s,

17:19.700 --> 17:43.526
was an Arctic explorer, but also very interested 
in the question of interaction of the Earth with

17:19.700 --> 17:43.526
space, the question of how the Earth had formed, 
the dust that it had accreted from, and what

17:19.700 --> 17:43.526
meteorites could tell us about the origin of the 
solar system. And I was always fascinated by his

17:43.866 --> 17:49.032
work.

17:50.058 --> 18:02.837
In the deep sea sediments, you also find traces of 
the influx of cosmic materials onto the Earth in

17:50.058 --> 18:02.837
the form of fine cosmic dust that is not so diluted 
in the deep sea as it is on land. And the work with

18:04.039 --> 18:13.633
that then led me on still further into these

18:04.039 --> 18:13.633
questions that I already earlier had been 
interested in. And particularly the presence

18:13.673 --> 18:19.862
here, we succeeded in attracting to Scripps one of 
the great authorities in this field named

18:20.855 --> 18:24.539
Professor Harold Urey. And everybody around 
Harold Urey becomes enthusiastic by what he's

18:25.940 --> 18:33.027
doing. That further catalyzed my interest in this 
field. Okay. And so you seem to think it was natural

18:38.813 --> 18:47.402
then to, if I may coin a word, to sort of relate the 
sciences of the galaxy with the sciences of the

18:38.813 --> 18:47.402
ocean? Or I would say the science of the solar 
system with that of the ocean. The galaxy, as such,

18:51.141 --> 18:55.105
is a step I haven't taken yet. Okay. Then what is the 
Space Research Laboratory? Because that implies

18:59.309 --> 19:01.051
galaxy to be. Well, you can divide space into near 
space. Okay. And the solar system, which is

19:06.116 --> 19:14.284
essentially our bound system, And then, as you 
say, the galaxy, which is a much larger concept,

19:15.243 --> 19:19.247
much more enormous. And I've never been,

19:20.027 --> 19:45.250
or I've limited myself so far to the questions of 
our solar system, particularly because with the

19:20.027 --> 19:45.250
techniques that I'm using and the material that 
I'm using, one has access essentially by

19:20.027 --> 19:45.250
observation only to the, or mostly to the solar 
system.

19:48.571 --> 19:51.615
But I'm sorry, what's your question? What is the 
Space Research Laboratory? Oh. The Space

19:55.620 --> 20:00.807
Research Laboratory, again, was a convenience of 
the time. There were several people at the time

20:00.847 --> 20:03.851
here on campus. The campus was growing now under 
Roger Revelle's direction. And we started to

20:07.976 --> 20:16.587
accumulate on purpose many physicists and 
chemists who were interested in Not only the

20:17.292 --> 20:22.719
ocean, but the Earth as a whole and the solar system 
and the universe. People like Harold Dury first,

20:22.859 --> 20:35.154
Professor James Arnold, the Burbidges, 
Professor Jeffrey and Margaret Burbidge. And

20:36.616 --> 20:43.784
after a while, Professor McIlwain, for example, 
has done lots of work on the Van Allen belts and the

20:36.616 --> 20:43.784
radiation belts around the Earth. And it became a 
practical... administrative matter to try to

20:46.688 --> 21:16.189
pull all these things, all these people together 
into some kind of organization that was very loose

20:46.688 --> 21:16.189
and perhaps more consisted in a work than the Space 
Research Institute, which then served as an

20:46.688 --> 21:16.189
organization to deal with the outside world, 
particularly the sponsoring agency that was

20:46.688 --> 21:16.189
NASA.

21:17.131 --> 21:19.414
What were your actions as director? That's what I 
would like to find out. What kind of direction did

21:21.537 --> 21:24.582
you try to give to the Space Institute? 
Practically nothing. That was essentially...

21:29.910 --> 21:32.453
The idea was to... I mean, at that time, scientists 
were very individualistic, and there was no great

21:32.473 --> 21:40.505
attempt to force everybody to do the same thing. So 
the idea was that only one of Herb York, who was

21:41.566 --> 21:46.834
chancellor at the time, to create an umbrella for 
all of these people. And what I had to do was a

21:51.199 --> 22:15.640
minimum of integration of results to present them 
to the space agency to convince them that our

21:51.199 --> 22:15.640
campus was a worthy recipient of further funding 
and particularly student support.

22:16.126 --> 22:19.030
What is the Institute for the Study of Matter? 
Well, that is yet another interesting creation in

22:20.372 --> 22:32.229
the early days of the expanded

22:20.372 --> 22:32.229
campus here. Due to the arrival of the great solid 
state physicist, Professor Bernd Matthias, who

22:33.912 --> 22:44.327
is one of the foremost pioneers in the field, 
particularly of material science in general, and

22:45.421 --> 22:54.170
particularly superconductivity. And he was one 
of our great catches. And again, he's a very

22:58.715 --> 23:09.207
inspiring and brilliant man

22:58.715 --> 23:09.207
who enthusiasmates everybody around him. And he 
established, and then again for the purpose of

23:14.328 --> 23:23.419
generating an umbrella for all activists in the 
field, an institute called the Institute for the

23:14.328 --> 23:23.419
Study of Matter. And I felt that I would like to 
branch a little into that fundamental field to

23:24.300 --> 23:43.423
learn more about the atomic molecular structure 
of the solids that I depended on in my work. joined

23:43.994 --> 23:47.037
in his effort in those early days.

23:50.521 --> 24:03.234
Okay, now, your publications have concentrated 
on the geology, chemistry, and physics of outer

23:50.521 --> 24:03.234
space, interspersed with occasional articles on 
marine geochemistry, if I understand it

23:50.521 --> 24:03.234
correctly. Would you agree with that? And also 
material science. And materials. Okay, right. I

24:08.559 --> 24:09.921
would agree with that, certainly. Now, Is space 
then a key to oceans for you or is space by itself for

24:10.927 --> 24:17.935
you in terms of research? I see it all as an 
interrelated system and the oceans are a very

24:17.955 --> 24:39.499
interesting special phenomenon generated on 
some of the planets due to the separation from the

24:17.955 --> 24:39.499
primordial matter of water on the surface of the 
planet and I like to understand the ocean partly as

24:40.610 --> 24:56.072
it exists today and the processes it shows today, 
partly as a recorder of the most immediate past

24:40.610 --> 24:56.072
history of the Earth. That means the last 
something like 100 million years, the very most

24:56.132 --> 25:03.843
recent pages in the history of the Earth. But space 
science has opened up for us questions that refer

25:11.018 --> 25:17.424
to the very earliest history of the Earth that are 
no longer recorded in any existing settlements

25:11.018 --> 25:17.424
because they've been wiped out. And we can learn 
from what we see on other planets and in material

25:18.345 --> 25:26.212
that has not yet formed any planets. From that we 
can learn where the ocean originally came from and

25:26.232 --> 25:34.720
how it originally formed. Okay, good. What was the 
American Chemical Society PRF award presented in

25:40.752 --> 25:43.555
honor of in 1961? Oh, I guess it must have been in 
response or some recognition of the work that

25:44.035 --> 26:08.818
started with the work on the Deep Sea Expedition 
and continued its scripts afterward, trying to

25:44.035 --> 26:08.818
clear up some of the questions of the metabolism, 
of the chemical metabolism of the ocean. and the

26:09.980 --> 26:23.112
relationship between the

26:09.980 --> 26:23.112
ocean sediments or the use of the ocean sediments 
as a record of the

26:09.980 --> 26:23.112
past history of the Earth.
