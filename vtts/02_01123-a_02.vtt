WEBVTT

00:01.381 --> 00:30.241
But the point I was going to make that I wanted to 
come back to was prior to 1980

00:01.381 --> 00:30.241
and in the Institute for Solid State Electronics, 
on more than one occasion, I had been approached by

00:01.381 --> 00:30.241
industry or individuals starting a business to do 
work, to fund work, development work at Texas A&M

00:01.381 --> 00:30.241
in our Institute for Solid State Electronics.

00:30.261 --> 00:31.202
And of course, I'd already gotten several patents 
myself at Texas Instruments, and then again in the

00:33.595 --> 00:43.225
work Jack and I was doing together on the solar 
cell. And the difference between the industrial

00:43.245 --> 00:56.700
world and the agricultural world, as my old friend 
Neville Clark used to say, who was director of the

00:43.245 --> 00:56.700
Aggie Transfer Station while I was the 
engineering, he said, you know, technology

00:43.245 --> 00:56.700
transfer in the farming business is you pick up the 
phone and call your neighbor and tell him you've

00:57.170 --> 01:03.939
got a sack of the new hybrid corn out on the porch, 
come by and get a cup full.

01:06.963 --> 01:12.431
And TI doesn't call up Motorola and tell them 
they've got a new circuit design, come by and make a

01:06.963 --> 01:12.431
copy. And I had argued as a faculty member in the 
late 70s that we had to get an intellectual

01:14.714 --> 01:22.644
property policy. And Fred Bitson and said, we're a 
publicly funded institution, and whatever we do

01:24.288 --> 01:29.293
is owned by all the people, and we give it away. And I 
said, hell, you can't give it away. Nobody will

01:31.415 --> 01:32.757
take it. Nobody's going to put the extra resources 
into it that have to be. If it's public, that's

01:36.701 --> 01:37.822
right. If they can't own it. That's right. You 
can't give it. You can sell it to TI, but you cannot

01:41.746 --> 01:46.230
give it to them. And I couldn't argue that point. As 
a faculty member, I couldn't get enough

01:49.735 --> 01:52.259
attention. But when I became the director of the 
Engineering Experiment Station, I was a member of

01:52.740 --> 01:56.986
the Executive Committee. I ran a state agency. I 
had resources. And I couldn't argue the point at

02:02.315 --> 02:07.142
the Executive Committee level. The board 
understood it implicitly

02:07.162 --> 02:13.853
and pushed for it. And the chancellor formed a team 
to review and study it and put forth a

02:15.250 --> 02:22.240
recommendation, and we did. In those days, I got to 
chair a lot of fun stuff. I got to chair the research

02:27.528 --> 02:31.794
park committee, the airport committee. It

02:31.814 --> 02:36.782
was an interesting period for me. And the 
recommendation was to do it. Texas A&M wouldn't

02:40.681 --> 02:45.407
put any money in it, and the Ag Experiment Station 
wouldn't put any money in it. The system argued

02:45.427 --> 02:49.532
they didn't have any money, so I funded the whole 
thing myself. Did you? I did it. Hired the first guy

02:52.275 --> 03:03.007
in the Experiment Station, and got a policy that we 
would split 50-50 with any researcher, whatever

02:52.275 --> 03:03.007
we got out of it. And when we negotiated the first 
royalty for a million dollars, out of the

03:10.162 --> 03:21.017
development in the Food Protein R&D Center, Ed 
Lucis' operation, when they came up with a

03:10.162 --> 03:21.017
technique for taking the soy taste out of soybean 
oil. And we licensed that to a Japanese company for

03:22.098 --> 03:29.008
$1 million to be paid $100,000 a year over 10 years. 
And I got the first $100,000 check and cut a $50,000

03:29.028 --> 03:36.338
check to these three guys over in the Food Protein 
R&D Center. It was interesting the stimulus that

03:37.212 --> 03:41.418
was for all the new patent applications. And it was 
also interesting the impact that had within the

03:42.760 --> 03:50.130
system, because shortly thereafter it was 
decided that we needed to move this office over to

03:42.760 --> 03:50.130
the system. It was done. And I was pleased, but I 
never got paid back. The university and the

03:56.178 --> 03:59.102
experience station all agreed they owed me money. 
But

03:59.555 --> 04:21.357
to my knowledge, I put way over $150,000 of the 
Engineering Experiment Station's money on

03:59.555 --> 04:21.357
behalf of the A&M system with prorated parts to be 
paid by different system parts. I don't know

04:23.740 --> 04:27.704
what's ever happened to that, but I know the 
history well because I did it. And I had to do it. I

04:29.288 --> 04:30.189
just had to do it. But I knew it had to be done. You 
know, to create a property right. Sure. If you're

04:35.514 --> 04:55.092
ever going to link, and the nation is going to get 
any opportunity for the academic and industrial

04:35.514 --> 04:55.092
community to learn how to work together, the 
academic community had to mature to the point of

04:35.514 --> 04:55.092
being able to say, yes, we own this property, yes, 
we can license it to you, and yes, we will work with

04:35.514 --> 04:55.092
you to make money off of it for yourself. And that 
that'll Pay some of the mothers and daddies in a job

04:58.229 --> 05:05.477
that you give them whose children are likely to 
come back to this institution. And while that may

05:05.578 --> 05:14.828
not be uniformly equal, if we tried the other way, 
as Fred used to argue about a lot of other things,

05:05.578 --> 05:14.828
we'd reach uniform mediocrity. So at any rate, I go 
back to that point because it's relevant to the

05:16.370 --> 05:26.582
Hark story.

05:29.380 --> 05:34.125
And we can come to that in a minute, but I'll try to 
focus on that. And the relevancy and the

05:34.185 --> 05:53.346
importance and the difference between HARC and, 
say, the Texas A&M System or the Engineering

05:34.185 --> 05:53.346
Experiment Station as an agency of the state 
operating in the A&M System, trying to

05:34.185 --> 05:53.346
effectively link the private sector with the 
academic sector is the bureaucracy and

05:54.119 --> 06:00.307
constraint of a publicly funded institution over 
a private one, which is New York. And when you look

06:01.889 --> 06:21.173
around the country, and I began to do that, as I 
began to think how, OK, I've got this

06:01.889 --> 06:21.173
responsibility as a CEO of a state agency to turn 
this agency into an effective way to help the state

06:01.889 --> 06:21.173
of Texas support its industry. like the 
agricultural experiment station, has helped its

06:21.777 --> 06:24.881
farmers. I'm supposed to be helping the TIs and 
the... But you have a whole different

06:28.787 --> 06:30.690
constituency out there. Oh, and a very different 
philosophy. And if you try other than the generic

06:32.432 --> 06:48.796
one to say the engineering experiment station 
should be helping industry as the agricultural

06:32.432 --> 06:48.796
experiment station helped the agribusiness 
industry, or the farmers more specifically, the

06:32.432 --> 06:48.796
analogy breaks down. Very fast. And

06:52.709 --> 07:06.188
when you look around the country, as I was going to 
say, and you look at Silicon Valley and Menlo Park,

06:52.709 --> 07:06.188
you find Stanford and SRI. And Stanford's 
private, and SRI's private. Stanford Research

07:10.614 --> 07:13.918
Institute are now SRI International. But it's 
kind of the link. to do research of relevance to

07:17.903 --> 07:25.634
industry that drew on the talent at Stanford, 
which was SRI. But industry went to SRI, not to

07:25.974 --> 07:28.198
Stanford.

07:31.783 --> 07:39.954
And when you look at Route 128 in the Boston 
miracle, you find Harvard and MIT private. When

07:40.896 --> 07:46.864
you go to the Research Triangle Park, you find Duke 
and the Research Triangle Institute private now

07:47.637 --> 08:10.725
you find North Carolina North Carolina State 
which are public and also a member of the Research

07:47.637 --> 08:10.725
Triangle Institute but this theme of private 
institutions is too consistent to ignore

07:47.637 --> 08:10.725
particularly when you're running an agency in the 
state like Texas dealing with the Bubba's in

07:47.637 --> 08:10.725
Austin so you had to come keenly aware of this Yeah, 
the difference. Character. That's right. And I

08:13.844 --> 08:15.606
had become keenly aware. I had been forced to 
become keenly aware, asking myself, can it be this

08:15.706 --> 08:29.382
tough for all these other areas that are doing it, 
that I've got all of this politics to fight

08:15.706 --> 08:29.382
through? And why do I have all of this politics? 
Well, I had all of this politics to fight through

08:33.506 --> 08:39.413
because this state, Achilles' heel of our 
education, is you buy your seat. on a board of

08:40.490 --> 08:41.972
higher education. It's who gives the governor, 
the winning governor, the most money. And the

08:45.815 --> 08:50.620
greatest prize or seats on UT Austin and Texas A&M, 
those are the two most coveted ones. And we

08:52.683 --> 08:58.488
occasionally get very talented members. But 
that's an accident,

09:00.090 --> 09:05.856
not a cause. And see, I've gone beyond the 
knee-jerk fear of even putting this on tape,

09:06.950 --> 09:12.418
Henry. This is so important to the state's future 
that it needs to be said. The fact that when I

09:17.365 --> 09:26.118
started reporting to Texas A&M Board of Regents, 
one of them had an eighth-grade education and

09:17.365 --> 09:26.118
really got my attention. And I wondered, 
wonderful guy, good old rancher from Uvalde, but

09:26.138 --> 09:36.433
hell, he was a big old hunting and fishing buddy 
with Dolph Briscoe, and he just gave old Dolph a lot

09:26.138 --> 09:36.433
of money and got him elected, and Dolph Asking what 
he wanted, he told him, and hell, he gave it to him.

09:39.982 --> 09:42.366
He didn't have any business being on Texas A&M 
before. I mean, he loved us a lot, and he showed up to

09:44.929 --> 09:48.514
meetings, and he was a wonderful guy. But how can 
you be on the board of anything if you don't

09:49.295 --> 09:52.780
understand their product? I mean, it's a 
travesty. So we've got some excellent board

09:57.266 --> 10:04.075
members in this state on our boards. But I 
handpicked the one at ARC. I didn't check with the

10:08.511 --> 10:09.773
governor. And it didn't have anything to do with 
who they were for or against. It had to do with who

10:14.239 --> 10:17.363
they are, what they know, and what they produced. 
It's a very different approach and much more

10:18.424 --> 10:28.036
relevant, I think, to building the kind of 
institution that can serve. And I think that

10:28.216 --> 10:35.766
that's probably the single most distinguishing 
thing between A private university or

10:36.252 --> 10:49.024
institution and a public one is the way the board 
selected.

10:49.044 --> 10:54.870
Next, and maybe of equal importance, is the public 
perception of the use of public funds. Tax

10:57.152 --> 10:57.993
dollars. It's different to go out for Rice 
University to go out and ask for money to run the

10:58.673 --> 11:04.639
institution. and have people give it to you than it 
is just to tax the citizens and then allocate it to

11:05.412 --> 11:13.765
the public institution. There's a different 
level of accountability that's implied in that. I

11:20.615 --> 11:28.828
think that's one of the reasons that an 
institution like Texas A&M for so long, even in

11:20.615 --> 11:28.828
defiance of logic, it's such a powerful thing. 
It's kind of like Galileo had the telescope for six

11:28.848 --> 11:33.715
months before he even thought about looking at the 
heavens with it. It was the province of the church.

11:36.906 --> 11:39.288
I mean, he was using it as a navigational tool. And 
then one day he looked up and saw a star and said,

11:40.149 --> 11:44.154
gee, this is exciting. So there's a built-in 
inflexibility. Yeah, there's a built-in

11:47.658 --> 11:51.522
perceptional thing that you can't go through that 
barrier. I mean, that's everybody. So whatever

11:52.863 --> 11:55.426
you develop here, you give it to everybody when you 
can't. But you still keep thinking that you ought

11:56.527 --> 12:00.091
to be able to do that somehow when it's impossible. 
That's not the culture of the grand process. So all

12:03.192 --> 12:17.050
of that was beginning to sink in in my experience 
base of being challenged to run a state agency that

12:03.192 --> 12:17.050
was challenged to provide this link. And my own 
experience as a professor and my own experience as

12:19.013 --> 12:31.950
an industrialist and my growing experience as an 
industrialist, as a member of the board of a high

12:19.013 --> 12:31.950
technology company, as a member of the research 
staff of a major corporation like Texas

12:32.673 --> 12:38.781
Instruments. So, PARC was created in 1983, 
roughly, on paper. Where? Who? That was done on the

12:50.317 --> 12:53.161
initiative of George Mitchell.

12:55.925 --> 12:58.208
And George Mitchell contacts who? Okay.

13:02.288 --> 13:04.290
Or did someone contact George Mitchell? No, I 
think this was George's own self-initiative. And

13:09.757 --> 13:28.178
George has launched the real estate development 
of the Woodlands,

13:09.757 --> 13:28.178
which I believe was done about 15 years ago now, 
maybe 16.

13:31.600 --> 13:43.250
So

13:31.600 --> 13:43.250
George launched the Woodlands in 69,

13:31.600 --> 13:43.250
71, whatever. And

13:43.530 --> 14:00.325
most of what I'll say now is my impressions of what 
was happening as opposed to specific historical

13:43.530 --> 14:00.325
documentation. This is kind of images. based upon 
untold hours of George and I talking and hearing

14:02.262 --> 14:12.303
one another talk.

14:13.546 --> 14:22.785
You know, I think if we were doing this parallel 
kind of path, what I've just told you about my own

14:13.546 --> 14:22.785
experience, if we backed up In the 70s and tried to 
ask the question, now what's George learning out

14:23.255 --> 14:28.262
there? And where is he going? And how did what he was 
doing and what I was doing cause these curves to

14:29.323 --> 14:34.830
cross? It's kind of the way I see this. Because when 
Matt and George's curves crossed,

14:37.714 --> 14:49.990
vis-a-vis Hark at least, now we crossed to know one 
another prior to Hark. And that was because George

14:50.010 --> 14:52.333
was an Aggie. or is an Aggie, and he was asked to 
chair the Target 2000 project. That's where you

15:01.080 --> 15:03.242
first encountered Mitchell? That's right. And 
Target 2000 was A&M's effort to follow the

15:04.423 --> 15:16.695
governor, then Governor Clements' lead in Texas 
2000, which had been a state study on the future of

15:04.423 --> 15:16.695
Texas. And so following that, A&M launched Target 
2000.

15:24.241 --> 15:53.775
all of the issues that i've just reviewed with you 
from my personal perspective of what was going on

15:24.241 --> 15:53.775
with skip porter back in those days uh you know 
that's just one one man's view and uh you could get

15:24.241 --> 15:53.775
this from several people that were watching what i 
was doing who would tell you a completely

15:24.241 --> 15:53.775
antithetical story of what i've just said because 
what they were seeing me do had no resemblance at

15:24.241 --> 15:53.775
all to what i just told you i was doing well no i think 
i am aware of both Several images. Yeah, yeah. But

15:56.028 --> 15:59.013
yours is the first time I've heard that statement. 
Yeah. And

16:00.354 --> 16:22.986
because what, in my judgment, and by my firsthand 
measure, by the fall of 1984, the

16:00.354 --> 16:22.986
success or failure of what I had turned the Texas 
Engineering Experiment Station into, depending

16:24.181 --> 16:27.924
upon who you talk to. I mean, in my judgment, I had 
done what I had been asked to do by the board and the

16:29.386 --> 16:39.875
chancellor, at least initially. As those people 
changed, particularly the chancellor and not so

16:39.895 --> 16:53.648
much the board, but

16:39.895 --> 16:53.648
I think they, at that point in time, had maybe 
wished I hadn't been asked to do what I was doing.

16:54.742 --> 17:10.978
There

16:54.742 --> 17:10.978
was one little point I was going to try to make in 
there that escaped me now. We

17:12.740 --> 17:23.230
were talking about TARC 2000.

17:24.391 --> 17:29.698
all of this different perception of what in the 
hell is going on with this A&M system. I mean, gee,

17:29.718 --> 17:34.444
should we move all these agencies back over under 
the university? Gee, should we have one guru dude

17:35.465 --> 17:43.335
that could somehow keep all of this patched 
together in some magical way? And we went through

17:43.375 --> 17:48.762
vice president of agriculture and vice president 
of engineering for a while. Then we went to Deputy

17:48.809 --> 17:53.255
Chancellor of Agriculture and Deputy Chancellor 
of Engineering, and then we went... I mean, we were

17:53.275 --> 17:56.719
trying Management 101 every other month up there. 
It was a joke. It was really boring to be in that, to

17:59.483 --> 18:15.203
have responsibility when...

17:59.483 --> 18:15.203
outside of all of that concern... You know, it was a 
neat, clean world. Oh, God. It was so... I mean, we

18:16.685 --> 18:18.748
fumbled the ball... Texas A&M could have captured 
the intellectual leadership in the state of Texas

18:19.336 --> 18:27.928
in five years in 1980. It made two, which I'm not 
going to talk about, bad calls back to back. It

18:36.279 --> 18:36.860
killed it. And it was hard to overcome that. I don't 
think it has yet. And subsequently. one to that

18:46.724 --> 18:52.310
I've quit watching it because it's too painful.

18:52.330 --> 18:58.277
It's amazing the resiliency of an institution 
that continues to do unusually amazingly well.

18:58.618 --> 19:00.640
It's hard to kill a good place. It is a good place. 
But it's always sad to be close when you knew it

19:03.864 --> 19:07.588
could have been so much better. But anyway, that 
was part of it. But this was really a tumultuous

19:09.791 --> 19:12.013
time. I don't know, you'd have to ask George his 
perception of what he learned about the

19:16.154 --> 19:25.526
institution and the players, being head of the 
entire Target 2000 project. Had he at that time now

19:25.566 --> 19:35.618
become aware of the operations and the character 
of teams while he was on to Target 2000? Oh, I think

19:35.638 --> 19:36.599
so. I think he became aware during the Target 2000 
study. OK.

19:44.909 --> 19:48.875
But HARC already, by 83 or whatever, exists? Yeah, 
on paper it exists. On paper? Yeah. It's a legal

19:51.158 --> 19:52.000
entity. It does not do anything. But it has 
actually been created as a legal entity? Oh, yes.

19:55.785 --> 19:56.106
Yes. Has it worked? Do you remember that? No, I 
don't. But it's around somewhere. It may have even

20:00.452 --> 20:03.437
been as early as late 82 sometime. But I think it was 
in 83. So it's sitting here, then? Oh, yeah. It

20:09.225 --> 20:09.886
exists. It's a created institution. has bylaws, 
has a board, but has nobody to run it. And I'm

20:20.407 --> 20:38.208
approached by Arthur D. Little, the consulting 
firm which George hired, to do a study of how other

20:20.407 --> 20:38.208
regions had evolved and developed in economic 
diversification. And they studied them. They

20:40.050 --> 20:42.253
studied the entry in the Illinois Institute of 
Technology in the Illinois area, they studied

20:42.588 --> 20:52.180
Route 128, they studied Silicon Valley, they 
studied Research Triangle Park. And I think

20:53.682 --> 21:01.212
George decided that the best model that he saw out 
of all of that for Houston and for Texas would be the

20:53.682 --> 21:01.212
Research Triangle Park. And that if Houston could 
take the lead in pulling together- Do you know why

21:01.232 --> 21:07.300
he decided that? No. I don't know if it was the 
relative

21:08.339 --> 21:24.340
level of growth of unrelated industries. I'm 
guessing now, absolutely guessing. George and I

21:28.546 --> 21:34.414
never specifically talked about, I've heard him 
say that in conversation to others several times.

21:36.576 --> 22:00.334
So I know there's been a mix of the institution 
because the diverse Well, I think I think in the

21:36.576 --> 22:00.334
invitation of particularly initially, Rice was 
the Duke and UH and Texas A&M were the North

21:36.576 --> 22:00.334
Carolina North Carolina State, so to speak, of the 
Research Triangle Institute, but it may also have

21:36.576 --> 22:00.334
been George is pretty deep thinker. He doesn't 
come to a decision casually or without insight.

22:05.379 --> 22:07.480
One of the brightest guys I've ever met. And he, it 
may well be, and I'm trying to ask myself that

22:08.381 --> 22:16.428
question now, trying to think of it as I'm sure 
George would analyze it at that time. Texas is

22:18.050 --> 22:24.235
strong in energy, and North Carolina is strong in 
textiles. Kind of one major horse driving, yet the

22:24.295 --> 22:30.220
strength, of already existing spot-off 
industries may have also been similarly weak. I

22:37.795 --> 22:38.216
don't know. Maybe it was because they both had a lot 
of pound trees.

22:45.306 --> 23:00.409
But at any rate, Arthur

22:45.306 --> 23:00.409
D. Little goes then to the institutions to inquire 
if they would be willing to participate.

23:01.165 --> 23:14.001
Duke, North Carolina, and North Carolina State 
had done with RTI in the, in HARC, which was then

23:01.165 --> 23:14.001
called the Houston Area Research Center, now 
Houston Advanced Research Center. And so I was

23:14.021 --> 23:17.725
interviewed. And Little was coming to you, and 
then basically you had to invite participation.

23:21.109 --> 23:22.631
Well, to get my opinion. Oh, okay. As a key person at 
Texas A&M, as to whether or not I think this makes

23:23.845 --> 23:36.696
sense or not, and several of us on Texas A&M's 
campus, as I'm sure on the other campuses were

23:23.845 --> 23:36.696
interviewed, what would you think about? They had 
a neat little list of questions prepared that I was

23:37.497 --> 23:41.801
asking. John Calhoun was asked, and others. 
Meanwhile, about the same time now, Calhoun, I

23:47.226 --> 23:51.810
assume, and Winnarty are... Doing the medical, 
beginning to get involved in the medical? Well,

23:54.821 --> 23:56.203
Winarty's already down. He's already down. Yeah, 
well, or he's at, Winarty at that point in time is

23:56.763 --> 24:01.028
with Gulf. Okay. He's with Gulf Research. Okay. 
Calhoun is still at A&M, and he's the vice

24:06.094 --> 24:14.303
president for engineering, matter of fact. Okay.

24:18.757 --> 24:31.635
I'll lose track of who was in what position when, 
but for a while Calhoun took over from Fred Benson

24:18.757 --> 24:31.635
as the Vice President and Deputy Chancellor of 
Engineering.

24:36.322 --> 24:46.536
But I'm asked to give recommendations to the A&M 
Board of Regents as to whether or not A&M ought to

24:36.322 --> 24:46.536
affiliate with PARCC.

24:49.047 --> 24:51.951
And I can see some real potential benefit. And I can 
see opportunities for conflict or competitive,

24:53.353 --> 25:13.544
even potentially negative competitive, if HAARC 
doesn't perceive its collaborative role to

24:53.353 --> 25:13.544
enhance and support. But my final analysis is that 
because at that point in time, for example, The

25:18.848 --> 25:24.837
engineering experiment station had 
responsibility for delivering all computing

25:18.848 --> 25:24.837
services to the A&M system. Remember the data 
processing center was a part of TEAS? Yeah.

25:30.325 --> 25:38.297
And I was put in charge again of the computer 
committee to advise the system on what computer

25:30.325 --> 25:38.297
acquisitions for the future we should be making. 
And the issue of should we have a supercomputer?

25:40.901 --> 25:43.945
Should we have another central processor or 
should we have distributed computing? I mean, I'd

25:45.173 --> 25:46.935
waded through that. Old Mac Prescott was on the 
committee, and Neville Clark, and I forget who

25:46.996 --> 25:53.164
else. But I got the black bean again to chair that 
baby. As I say, I had a lot of interesting

25:55.808 --> 26:00.534
responsibilities during those times. And, well, 
there was no way we could justify spending $10

26:01.456 --> 26:09.627
million or so on a supercomputer. There was no way 
any university in the state could justify doing

26:10.609 --> 26:13.813
that. unless you just wanted to buy $10 million 
worth of image to say you had one. There's nothing

26:20.293 --> 26:23.657
easier to share than a computer. And anybody 
that's ever had to operate one knows you don't want

26:24.558 --> 26:28.122
to. Let somebody else operate it. You'd be a user. 
And then you can complain why it doesn't work. So

26:36.513 --> 26:43.902
one of the things I suggested straight away is that 
Hark should go after a supercomputer and network

26:36.513 --> 26:43.902
it into all the collaborative universities. And 
the university should look to HARC and support

26:44.590 --> 26:54.463
HARC as the place for major, unusual computing 
resources to be provided to it. And you're

26:54.483 --> 26:57.046
thinking this primarily as director of TEAS? Yes. 
And as being in charge, basically, of the future

26:57.507 --> 27:02.874
computer needs and so forth of the university? You 
bet. That's right. And I'm thinking of it also.

27:07.253 --> 27:14.820
When you say director of TEAS, remember, I've 
learned to look at that as a state agency. And while

27:15.781 --> 27:25.690
it's located on Texas A&M's campus,

27:15.781 --> 27:25.690
well, it's an agency that serves the state, not 
just College Station. And that's something I'm

27:25.730 --> 27:28.172
sure the university had very great difficulty. 
Oh, big time. I had more trouble with the Aggies

27:29.413 --> 27:36.079
than I had with anybody else on that point, because 
all of those resources of that agency of the state

27:36.785 --> 27:42.854
They had been so long used to using them as they 
wanted to, particularly the College of

27:36.785 --> 27:42.854
Engineering. Just the College of Engineering. 
And with the College of Education and the College

27:45.939 --> 27:51.026
of Business and the College of Veterinary 
Medicine. When we started opening up these other

27:51.226 --> 27:58.838
divisions, which globally expanded the research 
capability. You're going to talk to Bill Mobley

27:58.858 --> 28:05.387
today about the value that was to

27:58.858 --> 28:05.387
you. You'll hear it. And that's where that college 
learned how to be competitive outside on the

28:07.261 --> 28:15.033
street with writing proposals. That's when we 
created Invent, the Institute for Ventures in New

28:15.053 --> 28:24.908
Technology, which you go talk to the students in 
the MBA program at Texas A&M, was far more valuable

28:15.053 --> 28:24.908
and exciting to them than any course they ever 
took.

28:29.575 --> 28:32.880
But that was not happily received. It was a 
delusion. I was spending, quote, Aggie money with

28:35.053 --> 28:43.782
the Longhorns or with the Lamar guys or with UT 
Arlington. And it was just this little narratini

28:44.502 --> 28:50.268
view of all the world was centered in College 
Station. It was hard to overcome. It still is. It's

28:53.591 --> 28:54.752
a big-time syndrome. It's true on most campuses. 
Yeah, it is. It's true on most individual

28:57.615 --> 28:59.317
professors. I mean, you don't really care what 
happens at all. It's what's in your lab. in your

29:02.341 --> 29:05.644
life, in your profession. And so

29:05.664 --> 29:31.369
I think that's important to understand from my 
personal perspective, to the extent that that's

29:05.664 --> 29:31.369
interesting in the history of the Woodlands at 
heart, is that I was committed intuitively as an

29:05.664 --> 29:31.369
individual, and maybe unusually, from the time I 
came to Texas A&M. I mean, when I came to Texas A&M in

29:32.058 --> 29:37.846
68, I was in an unusual position at Texas 
Instruments. I met every week with Fred Busey, the

29:38.346 --> 29:48.199
president of Texas Instruments, because the 
project that I was developing there was so

29:38.346 --> 29:48.199
important to Texas Instruments. And when I left 
and was on Texas A&M's campus, I could pick up the

29:48.219 --> 29:54.928
phone any minute and call the president of TI and 
get through. And I did it. And I'd say, Fred, we're

29:56.810 --> 29:58.993
missing a bet here. God, Texas A&M needs TI, and TI 
needs Texas A&M, and I see how to put this thing

29:59.632 --> 30:04.739
together. He said, okay, get on back down here. And 
he taught all the VPs together, and I'd go to

30:06.021 --> 30:14.753
Dallas, and everybody would agree it's 
wonderful, and I'd walk out of there, and

30:06.021 --> 30:14.753
everybody else would go back to doing what they had 
to get done. It's hard to make this work. This is not

30:16.375 --> 30:17.196
easy. But T's got started on that, but it created 
enough of a local whirlwind that it really made it

30:27.728 --> 30:32.375
just, I mean, life's too short. So I was kind of 
getting to that point where, you know, I had kind of

30:33.777 --> 30:39.025
two choices on a personal level. I could either toe 
off and win or real bloody win. And I was real

30:41.488 --> 30:43.972
confident that that's the way to work out. Or I 
could just say, hey, you've got too much respect

30:44.553 --> 30:52.004
for the institution and all of what could happen. 
And there's too much opportunity in your life of

30:52.644 --> 30:56.991
positivism. Sure. Why do all this negative stuff 
and end up doing damage to what you've loved and

30:57.378 --> 31:03.190
worked for? Just walk away and let everybody else 
take off with it and see what happens. Maybe

31:06.236 --> 31:07.880
they're right and you're wrong. Just go do your 
other thing. So that's kind of where I finally came

31:08.962 --> 31:10.986
out. OK. So the concept is here. Little has 
approached you. You've approached the board.

31:17.138 --> 31:21.184
suggesting involvement, participation. Yes, I 
supported the idea long before I met George

31:21.204 --> 31:25.049
Mitchell. I didn't know who he was. That's good.

31:30.516 --> 31:42.853
But

31:30.516 --> 31:42.853
it was easy for me to do that because that was 
philosophically the plane I was trying to get A&M

31:30.516 --> 31:42.853
on and learn more about myself. This was a risk I 
believed as a nation we had to be taking. I could

31:46.737 --> 32:04.785
feel this from just intuitively out on the street 
in Oregon and in Dallas and in College Station and

31:46.737 --> 32:04.785
in New York City and wherever else it was, I was 
going professionally and I was seeing the number

31:46.737 --> 32:04.785
of Japanese people showing up and presenting 
electronics papers. I just knew we had to start

32:05.687 --> 32:09.412
doing some things differently and take the risk of 
doing that. And I believed intuitively of the

32:09.753 --> 32:12.357
value of winking. I call them the three separate 
societies in our single one, government,

32:13.417 --> 32:19.102
industry, and academia. They just don't talk to 
one another, and they don't understand the

32:19.743 --> 32:23.126
culture, and their cultures are very different. 
NASA has the same problem. Well, they're part of

32:24.728 --> 32:25.849
the government. That's right. Yeah. And they're 
trying to establish those same linkages. Yes,

32:29.993 --> 32:30.793
right. And this institution can help much better 
than a publicly funded research university. And

32:36.719 --> 32:37.680
it will, and it is. And I hope it will. That's my 
goal. So, go ahead. At what point now were you

32:42.408 --> 32:45.833
approached to come to HAARP? Okay. Well, in 1980,

32:47.435 --> 32:58.271
late 83 or early 84, probably late 83. Well, HAARP 
was born in 83, let's say. And John Calhoun served

33:05.602 --> 33:11.250
on the executive committee of HARC's board of 
directors as the A&M representative.

33:22.717 --> 33:34.635
Each of the founding universities had four 
members on HARC's board, and one of those members

33:22.717 --> 33:34.635
served on the executive committee, which George 
Mitchell chaired.

33:36.377 --> 33:40.123
But that was all that ever happened, to my 
knowledge. the executive committee would meet. I

33:41.888 --> 33:43.170
don't think the full board ever did. And the 
executive committee would just kind of get and

33:44.312 --> 33:49.699
say, well, what do you guys think we could do to get 
HARC started? What would be a good project? Well,

33:53.324 --> 33:56.269
I'm not sure of the transition. We'd have to go back 
to the records to find this. But it was after Frank

33:59.613 --> 34:09.908
Vandiver had become president of Texas A&M and 
after John Calhoun retired, Frank called me and

33:59.613 --> 34:09.908
asked me to represent Texas A&M on Hark's board and 
be on the executive committee. Because Hark's

34:18.203 --> 34:24.149
bylaws call for the presidents of those 
universities to appoint those people.

34:29.355 --> 34:40.047
And that's

34:29.355 --> 34:40.047
when I met George Mitchell.

34:40.499 --> 34:54.755
Where exactly the target 2000 study is at that 
point in time, and where and how George and I may

34:40.499 --> 34:54.755
have or may not have interacted back on Texas A&M's 
campus, I don't know exactly. But I came to know

34:54.775 --> 35:05.287
George consciously that he was a Texas A&M 
graduate, that he was a guy living in Houston, and

34:54.775 --> 35:05.287
he was in the oil and gas business. And that when he 
was asked, to chair the Target 2000. That's how I

35:12.496 --> 35:13.337
met him. I went to one of our organizational 
meetings and I met George Mitchell. I had no idea

35:17.843 --> 35:23.991
that he was the forces behind HARC or that he had a 
real estate project called the Woodlands or

35:17.843 --> 35:23.991
anything else. And how, what he learned about me 
during that process and who I was and what the

35:25.213 --> 35:34.165
engineering experimentation was doing and 
anything else, I have no idea. Vandiver appointed

35:34.330 --> 35:39.117
you to the board as a representative of Texas A&M. I 
might argue you wouldn't slight lead if we picked

35:39.678 --> 35:42.242
up this morning. In fact, Vandiver apparently had 
some pretty close association with Roger

35:42.262 --> 35:48.111
Gallagher's Gladys. That could have been part of 
it. Could be, yeah. Well, I don't think so, because

35:53.078 --> 35:56.423
Roger's joined this company since I've been here. 
Part of that, he was with Exxon and Prince. 79. He

36:01.398 --> 36:02.600
said he joined in 79. Did he? Yeah. Ah, okay. Well, 
he's become president since I've been here. He

36:06.986 --> 36:08.007
became president in 86. Yeah, okay. I know he 
became president since I've been here, but he's

36:08.708 --> 36:14.015
with the company. Okay. Yeah, that's 
interesting, yeah. Well, okay.

36:21.406 --> 36:25.431
So I start coming on A&M's behalf,

36:29.798 --> 36:32.261
to the executive committee of the HART board.

36:35.125 --> 36:44.579
So Frank has really asked me to represent Texas A&M 
in an official capacity.

36:44.599 --> 36:50.407
I guess with my professorial hat of double E on. I 
think it's in a way that's an odd, where you're the

36:50.427 --> 36:56.515
director of TEAS, a state agency. Yeah, but I was 
also a professor of engineering. But that, again,

37:00.106 --> 37:05.073
is the kind of murky lines of, plus Frank and I knew 
one another well. Of course, we served on the

37:05.093 --> 37:08.677
system executive committee together. And 
there's nothing that any one of those entities

37:09.438 --> 37:18.390
does that doesn't have some relationship and 
impact on the other. And so I was pleased to do that.

37:21.674 --> 37:23.717
Told Frank I'd be happy to do it. I really didn't 
know what it involved or entailed. I knew about

37:26.836 --> 37:40.552
HARC because I had been inquired and interviewed 
by Arthur

37:26.836 --> 37:40.552
Little. So I put forth the idea of the 
supercomputer at a board meeting. George had

37:47.461 --> 37:49.283
brought in or I guess the executive committee of 
the board had concurred to hire a guy named Harvey

37:51.322 --> 38:09.406
McMains, who worked with

37:51.322 --> 38:09.406
George Kosmetsky at the Institute for 
Constructive Capitalism, IC Squared, at UT

37:51.322 --> 38:09.406
Austin. And Harvey came here on, I think, a 
halftime basis to be the interim president of

38:09.426 --> 38:17.397
HARC.

38:20.296 --> 38:23.219
And so Harvey would sit in on these meetings.

38:29.706 --> 38:36.854
So a team was organized,

38:29.706 --> 38:36.854
pulling together some of the professors from 
various institutions. I think the lead came out of

38:36.874 --> 38:43.641
the University of Houston to go after one of the NSF 
centers for supercomputing. And that proposal

38:45.563 --> 38:49.527
was written and submitted in 84. Also, in

38:50.435 --> 38:58.584
late... Excuse me, that's an NSF application. Did 
you say NSF? Yes, National Science Foundation.

39:03.829 --> 39:13.019
And it basically is sort of a cooperative 
application between universities centered

39:03.829 --> 39:13.019
through Hartz and Minsky applications. That's 
right. And these are members of a collegial or

39:13.500 --> 39:17.284
whatever association. That's right, yeah. So the 
proposal... NSF had announced they were going to

39:20.725 --> 39:27.297
establish four national supercomputer centers. 
And so our proposal was that one of those be here at

39:27.317 --> 39:37.074
HARC, which would link the collaborative 
institutions and serve all these different

39:27.317 --> 39:37.074
research universities.

39:40.099 --> 39:41.842
And I'll come back to that in a second, if you like. 
But we ranked in the top eight. four there were

39:45.278 --> 40:11.455
eight picked as finalists and then four of those 
eight were funded and we were not one of those and so

39:45.278 --> 40:11.455
when i came here in january of 1985 as hark's first 
full-time president or first president i guess i

39:45.278 --> 40:11.455
should say

39:45.278 --> 40:11.455
one of my first moves was to go to nsf and find out why 
we didn't win and to see what it would take in order

40:11.789 --> 40:20.140
to come after such a designation in the future, and 
learned that that was not likely to happen. There

40:20.180 --> 40:21.923
were not going to be those resources. And so we went 
after bringing the supercomputer in here on our

40:23.325 --> 40:29.733
own initiative, working with the private sector. 
And we're successful at doing it, as you know. Why

40:32.397 --> 40:34.540
didn't Art get that? the first initiative? What'd 
you find out? I really have to go back and review

40:40.463 --> 40:42.827
that. It's been too long since I've asked the 
question.

40:48.597 --> 40:50.320
Technical, mechanical, philosophical? Well, it

40:50.340 --> 40:57.693
wasn't so glaring that I remember it six years 
later. It was competition, and We were

41:01.773 --> 41:03.315
complimented. We had a good proposal, a 
competitive proposal. We just got beat. You can

41:08.340 --> 41:10.783
get beat for a lot of reasons.

41:17.971 --> 41:27.021
That follows into a lot of interesting stuff that 
will be interesting in the history of the park, I

41:17.971 --> 41:27.021
think, but not so much the history of the 
woodlands.

41:28.233 --> 41:31.498
But also, I still haven't gotten you here yet. 
You're in 1980, but who hired you? The board of

41:34.282 --> 41:35.944
Hark. Who made that contact, direct contact? 
George Mitchell.

41:42.434 --> 41:45.318
And I'll tell you the details of that, but I want to 
get this other thought in while I've got it. In 83,

41:46.019 --> 41:57.396
while I'm still the director of the engineering 
experiment station, the idea for the

41:46.019 --> 41:57.396
superconducting supercollider surfaces, the 
SSC, And it surfaces on A&M's campus in a guy named

41:59.468 --> 42:03.313
Peter McIntyre. And Peter goes to see Frank 
Vandiver, president of Texas A&M, and describes

42:05.056 --> 42:17.613
this mystical, magical, giant federal project. 
And Frank says, Peter, that sounds exciting, but

42:17.633 --> 42:23.140
that's a big deal. Go see Porter.

42:27.366 --> 42:28.868
So he comes to see me. And I listened. And 
McIntyre's kind of a guy that you can't not listen

42:33.161 --> 42:37.989
to. And I

42:39.952 --> 42:57.820
listened long enough to gain enough insight to 
realize that this project was of a scope and a

42:39.952 --> 42:57.820
dimension that it was unlikely the state of Texas 
could play. The whole state. It was certainly

42:59.577 --> 43:13.479
impossible for Texas A&M,

42:59.577 --> 43:13.479
the entire system, certainly not Texas A&M 
University, but if we pulled everything the A&M

42:59.577 --> 43:13.479
system had, we weren't even close. I mean, we 
weren't even close. And the thought of Hark hit me.

43:21.632 --> 43:27.441
If the state of Texas wanted to line up and try to 
compete in that league, in the intellectual

43:28.180 --> 43:44.596
business of big science, Park was the only chance 
it had that it would take pooling the best minds of

43:28.180 --> 43:44.596
our four largest research institutions with the 
structure of a new institution designed to do this

43:28.180 --> 43:44.596
kind of thing. So at a sequence of events, I told 
Peter he ought to go meet George Mitchell. who was

43:58.218 --> 44:03.127
chairman of the board of a new institution called 
HARC. And this began to get enough visibility on

44:05.531 --> 44:15.067
A&M campus that it began to make a lot of people 
nervous. Art Hanson was getting nervous. Perry

44:18.333 --> 44:19.996
Atkinson was getting nervous. Frank Vandiver was 
getting nervous. And we were spending a lot of time

44:23.513 --> 44:29.401
at the executive committee level of the system 
talking about this project. Did McIntyre go to see

44:29.461 --> 44:31.804
Mitchell? Yes, he did. And he took Sheldon Glashow 
with him, the Nobel laureate from Harvard, with a

44:33.947 --> 44:47.445
lot of preposterous proposals, thinking it would 
apply to the flamboyant, big scope nature of Texas

44:33.947 --> 44:47.445
and big oil, talking about the Texatron, and 
they'd use this to find all bio-absorbent

44:47.712 --> 44:57.406
neutrinos in the earth and a bunch of stuff like 
that, which George, of course, saw through. But

44:57.887 --> 45:00.270
intellectually, the project was interesting.

45:03.474 --> 45:13.669
I finally became convinced that Peter McIntyre 
had enough energy

45:03.474 --> 45:13.669
and interest and commitment to this that it might 
be possible that they could pull a team together.

45:19.152 --> 45:24.880
So I brought the idea as the executive committee 
member of HARC's board representing Texas A&M. I

45:24.960 --> 45:32.991
committed A&M

45:24.960 --> 45:32.991
in toto that if HARC wanted to run with this, we'd 
back their play. That got it off of our campus, got

45:34.833 --> 45:43.285
us out of the lead hot seat, which everybody was big 
time nervous about, and put it in an institution

45:43.855 --> 45:58.339
that had some chance of leading and pulling 
together all the other talent that would have to

45:43.855 --> 45:58.339
come from Bryce and UT Austin and U of H, plus all 
that would have to be hired and have some entity

45:43.855 --> 45:58.339
that could nurture and manage it to get us 
competitive. And George liked that.

46:05.010 --> 46:06.152
It was the second project. So we had the second. Why 
do you think Mitchell liked that? George is an

46:09.938 --> 46:10.639
intellectual. I think it also maybe appealed to 
his sense of the private, and that's been a

46:11.547 --> 46:18.415
persistent theme also. The mixture, like you were 
talking about, of the academic world. Yeah. And it

46:24.882 --> 46:30.548
also was big enough to be meaningful.

46:30.568 --> 46:33.712
And that's beyond Woodland's, though. I mean, 
that's not Woodland's thought and mentality. No,

46:36.355 --> 46:38.537
I don't think so. I mean, I agree with that. but if it 
if it happens in the woodlands that's that's good

46:41.686 --> 47:10.258
sure yeah and uh you know uh that's good pr yeah and 
uh and that's good visibility and and george

46:41.686 --> 47:10.258
doesn't miss many of those licks either that's 
what i'm trying to get he's a marketing man

46:41.686 --> 47:10.258
obviously but there are incentives and uh motives 
here that go far beyond you know the woodlands

46:41.686 --> 47:10.258
that's part of what i yes and uh
