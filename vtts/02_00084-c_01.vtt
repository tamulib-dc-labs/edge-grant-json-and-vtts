WEBVTT

00:03.203 --> 00:08.872
They play it through and then they get a little 
closer and a little closer. And all this time, if

00:09.192 --> 00:17.225
you don't go through it, you can't. I don't have the 
words really to describe it. But when it's over and

00:22.272 --> 00:31.827
you walk back to your dormitory in complete 
silence, I mean, you don't hear anybody, you don't

00:33.106 --> 00:37.231
hear any sound anywhere. And it, all kind of 
thoughts are going through your mind. Do you

00:43.958 --> 00:46.301
remember going to Muster before the war? No, sir. 
Almost no one does. Almost no one remembers

00:51.807 --> 00:53.508
Muster. So I'm getting the impression that that 
Muster at Corregidor kind of changed that

00:54.249 --> 01:03.079
entirely. And I've been told by two or three people 
that one of the reasons for that muster in the first

01:03.143 --> 01:19.279
place was to broadcast back to the families that 
certain young men in the tunnels on Corregidor

01:03.143 --> 01:19.279
were still alive. that the War Department 
encouraged them to give away to get that message

01:19.799 --> 01:25.887
back. All right, what about Bonfire? Do you 
remember Bonfire? Oh, yes, I remember Bonfire,

01:29.532 --> 01:48.979
but Bonfire was,

01:29.532 --> 01:48.979
I guarantee the people in Brazos County didn't 
like to see Bonfire come along because we just, we

01:29.532 --> 01:48.979
grabbed up any kind of wood we could anywhere, and 
old sheds and i don't remember anybody ever

01:49.870 --> 02:16.367
tearing down a new barn or anything like that but 
how long did y'all work on it

01:49.870 --> 02:16.367
uh three four weeks and it was held on the drill 
field uh i'm trying to think yeah yeah on the drill

01:49.870 --> 02:16.367
field And there was always an outhouse? Oh, always 
on the top. Oh, yeah. Yeah, always an outhouse. And

02:27.655 --> 02:45.882
I had to think a minute where the site of it, but I 
remember now that's where it was on the drill field

02:27.655 --> 02:45.882
because you could come in from Melbourne Road and 
circle around it. Well, you couldn't circle

02:46.807 --> 02:48.890
around either. You could come up one side. Yeah, 
you could, you could, you could. And we had, I know

02:54.520 --> 03:03.094
we had guards out there because after

02:54.520 --> 03:03.094
it got up old foot high or so where we had guards 
every night and freshmen had to guard. But nobody

03:10.594 --> 03:14.140
tried to burn it, did they? Not my freshman year. 
Not my freshman year. Did you attend a

03:21.551 --> 03:25.897
commencement in those days, an Aggie 
commencement? No, I didn't. okay i did not all

03:26.378 --> 03:55.913
right so you go away to the war and you said you're 
going to tell me about uh not coming back to to a m to

03:26.378 --> 03:55.913
finish your degree oh oh i uh i was injured in the 
second world war that's a pretty poor excuse but uh

03:26.378 --> 03:55.913
i when i i didn't know i was in the sir in the hospital 
a long time And I didn't really know what I wanted to

03:56.922 --> 04:00.327
do. And I

04:02.450 --> 04:23.101
finally went, got back to Laredo, make up my mind 
and had a couple of job offers and

04:02.450 --> 04:23.101
I tried one and took another. And

04:29.693 --> 04:34.259
always halfway regretted that I didn't make that 
effort. And then, what I did do was, when I finally

04:36.381 --> 04:58.789
retired, which was in 1980,

04:36.381 --> 04:58.789
I decided, I believe I'll go back, Texas A&M, and 
Maybe in, you know, maybe it'll take me a year and a

05:00.187 --> 05:04.992
half. But what the hell, I don't have anything to 
do.

05:10.717 --> 05:13.400
And so I called my friend Ed Cooper.

05:16.142 --> 05:22.188
And I said, Ed, check up and see what I can do. I said, 
I don't care what I get the degree in, anything I can

05:22.208 --> 05:27.173
do.

05:32.637 --> 05:34.279
He said, I'll see what I can do. Well, he called me 
and he says, Porter, he says,

05:36.361 --> 05:46.812
I want to tell you, he says, you're going to get a 
letter from me. And he says, I didn't want you to

05:48.674 --> 05:56.923
think I was hiding, but not calling you, but he 
said, I'm just calling you to tell you that I'll

05:59.097 --> 06:00.959
support you in whatever you want to do." But he 
says, just read the letter. Okay. And he says, this

06:05.164 --> 06:10.650
is one of the hardest letters I ever had to write for 
her. He says, you know, he says, it's been so long

06:11.011 --> 06:18.800
since you took any of those courses. And he says, 
other than giving you some allowance for being in

06:28.780 --> 06:52.105
the service and getting certain military things 
and so on and so forth, says none of the courses you

06:28.780 --> 06:52.105
took that are that far back

06:28.780 --> 06:52.105
would count towards a degree in today's world. So 
he says, you'd just about have to start at scratch.

06:58.070 --> 07:04.956
Well, I wanted to do, but I didn't want to do it that 
bad, so I dropped it right there. Right now, don't I

07:05.397 --> 07:07.058
recognize that ring? Yes, but let me tell you, when 
we went into the service, our class,

07:07.859 --> 07:19.290
everybody that was classified

07:21.717 --> 07:31.336
as a middle of the road junior,

07:21.717 --> 07:31.336
were given permission to get an Aggie ring. I 
didn't know that. And there's no, I don't know of

07:33.040 --> 07:37.549
any I remember. Who made that decision, do you 
know? Texas A&M made that decision. Was it an

07:44.606 --> 07:46.408
administrative decision? I have no idea, but I 
know that it was made and we were. How much did it

07:51.713 --> 07:53.115
cost, do you remember?

07:56.378 --> 07:59.081
It was around $60. A lot of money. A heck of a lot of 
money. I had to pay for it in four installments.

08:07.246 --> 08:07.807
Yes, sir. And that's your original? That's my ring 
right there. Do you have any good ring stories?

08:16.637 --> 08:16.937
Well.

08:20.161 --> 08:26.528
Where you lost it and it was found or somebody in 
some unusual circumstances recognized it? No.

08:29.011 --> 08:34.958
Oh, I've had worlds of people recognize it, and 
more or less like you they do. mine is worn so that

08:35.275 --> 08:39.639
they'd say, isn't that an Aggie ring? My ring, at 
that time they didn't make the ring that they do

08:39.920 --> 08:46.086
now. This ring had too much gold in it and it was too 
soft. And I put all the wear on that ring and the

08:50.250 --> 08:58.278
first three years I had it nearly. But I tell you, I 
wouldn't part with it. right now what so far what

09:05.296 --> 09:27.642
have we left out about your student days that we 
should have included i think we've probably

09:05.296 --> 09:27.642
included more than then it's going to be 
worthwhile i i did as far as student days i can't

09:05.296 --> 09:27.642
think of a heck of a lot more Can you look back now and 
realize some life-changing people or events from

09:28.415 --> 09:38.268
your A&M student days? Somebody that did 
something that affected your life?

09:51.765 --> 09:57.072
No, not in that respect, but... A lot of the people 
that I met then did

09:57.980 --> 10:09.476
things over the years that caused me to change my 
life.

10:12.481 --> 10:20.612
As I mentioned earlier, when I got out of A&M was the 
people I got to know. and the connections with

10:22.381 --> 10:24.663
them. And when I say connections, I don't mean that 
you're looking for something. True, friendly,

10:32.650 --> 10:48.245
friendship connections where they just thought 
of each other and felt like doing things for each

10:32.650 --> 10:48.245
other and so on and so forth. Let me tell you a story 
about Ed Davis. I won't take any more of your time,

10:51.355 --> 10:54.178
but I want to. No, no, no, I'm glad. Ed's

10:55.860 --> 11:02.066
mother and father were great, great, great 
people. And we spent nearly every weekend in

11:02.466 --> 11:09.733
Wichita Falls when we were up at Fort Sill, he and 
Dickie and I. He and Dickie were roommates at A&M,

11:11.695 --> 11:18.342
by the way.

11:20.414 --> 11:32.413
When he had gotten married, he and Janita came to 
Laredo, and they were going to Monterey on their

11:20.414 --> 11:32.413
honeymoon.

11:32.433 --> 11:43.671
And they

11:32.433 --> 11:43.671
came over and I treated them to dinner and so on, and 
the next day they went to Monterey.

11:46.334 --> 11:59.830
Well, I think that was a, I'm not sure if it was a 
Friday or a Saturday, but early Sunday morning

11:46.334 --> 11:59.830
over at the place I get a telephone call from 
Monterey. He says, Garner? Yeah. He says, this is

12:04.436 --> 12:05.557
the head. And I said, yeah, what can I do for you? He 
says, well, I'm down here in Monterey and says, I

12:15.190 --> 12:16.532
done run out of money. He says, I don't know what I'm 
gonna do. And I said, well, I tell you what, I said,

12:22.499 --> 12:30.608
Ed, there's a, I says, it's 10 o'clock. I says, 
there's a bus leaves here at 11. I said, now

12:36.415 --> 12:38.858
transport this Del Norte. Can you remember that? 
He said, yeah. I says, well, I'm gonna give the

12:41.861 --> 12:44.404
driver an envelope, and I'll have some money in 
there." I says, how much do you need? He says, oh,

12:52.667 --> 12:55.152
fifty dollars would be fine. Of course, you've got 
to remember, you could rent a hotel room in

12:55.313 --> 13:02.968
Monterey for three dollars then, you know, and you 
could eat for a dollar and a half. Yeah, that was a

13:03.068 --> 13:07.337
lot of money. So I said, well he'll have the money. 
He says, well I sure thank you and so on. Well a

13:15.034 --> 13:25.625
friend of mine there overheard

13:15.034 --> 13:25.625
the conversation and he says, you got to send 
somebody some money in Monterey? I said, yeah. He

13:26.826 --> 13:27.948
says, where does he stand? I said, he says he's at 
the Hotel Monterey. He says, yeah. He says, I got a

13:32.332 --> 13:35.856
friend there that runs a bar in the hotel. He said, 
if you want me to, we can call him, and he'll give him

13:36.730 --> 13:42.399
the money, and you can just send this money to my 
friend. I said, that'd sure be a lot easier. So he

13:45.644 --> 13:53.737
calls this guy down there and tells him, go up in the 
hotel and give $50 to this man. Well, the guy he's

13:53.757 --> 13:56.922
talking to doesn't speak much English, see. So a

13:58.404 --> 14:03.312
little while, the phone rings again.

14:06.599 --> 14:07.842
He called me the phone. I said, hello, Garner? He 
said, yeah, this is the head again. I said, yeah,

14:12.533 --> 14:15.420
what can I do for you? He said, listen, don't send 
that money. I said, what's the matter? He says, you

14:21.770 --> 14:28.558
know, he says, some damn fool muskin just knocked 
on my door and asked if I was A.W. Davis. And I said,

14:29.479 --> 14:30.320
yes. He says, he handed me $50 and turned around and 
walked off. He said, don't send that money.

14:40.952 --> 14:42.093
But anyway. Very good, very good. I've got to tell 
you one thing about Earl Rudder. I know you know a

14:47.479 --> 14:51.003
lot more about Earl Rudder than I do. No, no. I was on 
the board of the former student association one

14:53.056 --> 15:06.413
year or two years or whenever it was when Mr. Rutter 
was president. And it was back during the time when

15:06.433 --> 15:13.522
we were having all this student unrest on the 
campuses of the United States. And he met with us

15:15.665 --> 15:21.612
one time with our board And you know, Jim Rutter is 
pretty much for calling spades spades. And he told

15:30.621 --> 15:41.953
us, he says, you don't ever have to worry about us 
having these problems at Texas A&M like are

15:30.621 --> 15:41.953
happening all over everywhere else. He says, we 
don't have a bunch of wild-eyed professors here.

15:48.781 --> 15:51.244
And he says, we're not going to have. He says, some 
of these security checks that we run before we hire

15:52.996 --> 16:06.359
anybody from the instructor level up, they might 
be illegal. But we do them anyway, and I'll

16:06.379 --> 16:13.131
guarantee you we're not going to have that problem 
here at Texas A&M.

16:14.579 --> 16:18.385
He's dead, everybody dead, but that's what he 
said. And I remember a few times saying, too, if

16:20.187 --> 16:31.524
there's ever a problem, the guy that's going to be 
walking in front of the group to stop the problem is

16:20.187 --> 16:31.524
talking to you right now. In other words, you're 
going to have to deal with me, one way or the other.

16:37.372 --> 16:39.355
And that was very, very important. Well, I've got 
two or three concluding questions, but let's go on

16:39.824 --> 16:45.254
to the Cadillac bar before we do that. How did you 
get connected with it and tell me about it and

16:45.474 --> 16:50.683
describe it? I sure will. It

16:52.246 --> 16:59.880
belonged to my first wife's father. His name was 
Mayo Besson. Spell the last name. B-E-S-S-A-N.

17:06.145 --> 17:09.070
B-E-S-S-A-N. He was from Louisiana. And he had 
come down there in the middle 20s, opened up a

17:14.139 --> 17:23.355
place. Anyway, and he had reached, oh gosh, he was

17:33.470 --> 17:44.544
in his middle 60s or so, or 70s, almost 70, 65 to 70, 
when I got married. And he'd had a man that had

17:45.866 --> 17:52.494
worked for him for years over there that had had a 
heart attack, another Louisiana man. And he

17:52.594 --> 17:58.862
really didn't, he was thinking about closing the 
place up. But it was kind of a legend over there. And

18:03.406 --> 18:11.658
I was working on this side, and he approached me to 
see if I might be interested in going over there and

18:03.406 --> 18:11.658
going to work. I said, I think I would, but I'd like 
to think about it a little. I talked to the man that

18:19.149 --> 18:31.708
I'd been working for who was an old family friend 
and so on and so forth, and he told

18:19.149 --> 18:31.708
me, he says, Porter, it's a great opportunity for 
you. And he says, I don't

18:32.633 --> 18:40.763
want you to leave here, but I think it would be a 
great move.

18:43.626 --> 18:48.552
And he says, but one thing you have to remember, you 
stay on one side of that bar or the other. Don't try

18:49.633 --> 18:53.998
to work both sides of it. And so I did. I went over 
there and I went to work. This is what year? 48? Last

19:05.009 --> 19:06.953
part of 47. Oh, excuse me. Here, Benjo. Yellow.

19:16.151 --> 19:18.435
So anyway, I went over there and started working 
for him. I didn't know much about the business, but

19:23.314 --> 19:29.921
I learned and met a lot of friends, made a lot of 
friends. And we went through the flood over there,

19:31.542 --> 19:44.315
washed everything out, out of business for nine 
months,

19:31.542 --> 19:44.315
and then reopened. And shortly after that, He

19:51.608 --> 20:20.991
decided that he was going to get out of the business 
and he gave me an opportunity to buy it from him with

19:51.608 --> 20:20.991
the 10-year payout, which I was glad to have 
because even though he and I got along fine,

20:21.595 --> 20:35.807
It's not easy sometimes to run a place and have the 
complete responsibility but not have complete

20:21.595 --> 20:35.807
authority.

20:38.369 --> 20:51.180
And anyway,

20:38.369 --> 20:51.180
we averted any kind of problem and funny thing is 
fate would have it at a ten year payment

20:53.945 --> 21:00.274
And he died 20 days after I made my last payment. And 
to people who knew him and me, I always had said he

21:00.294 --> 21:10.249
wasn't going to die until he got his last payment. 
Anyway, he was a fine man. We got along well. But it

21:14.060 --> 21:19.805
was a legend institution down there. Describe 
where it was and describe it physically. All

21:22.968 --> 21:23.388
right. It was about three blocks into Mexico. It 
was a

21:27.592 --> 21:36.780
bar room. It had a long bar, about a 30-foot bar. at 
least 30-foot bar. And in the main dining room

21:46.637 --> 22:10.915
there in front of the bar was about,

21:46.637 --> 22:10.915
let's see, about 20 tables, and then another room 
behind it that had about another 20 tables, and

21:46.637 --> 22:10.915
then an old like a dance floor, which we didn't 
utilize at all back before, which at one time had

22:13.375 --> 22:30.013
been a gambling room before gambling went out in 
Mexico in 37, I believe, 37, 38.

22:32.035 --> 22:39.383
But anyway, we served mostly

22:32.035 --> 22:39.383
American foods. So it was both drink, both 
refreshments and? Oh yes, yes. We, it's like most

22:47.091 --> 22:53.980
of those places, the food's what draws the people, 
the drinks are where you make the money. But we

22:56.383 --> 23:01.209
always felt like we gave everybody a real run for 
their money. We were very reasonable price-wise.

23:06.336 --> 23:09.640
Who were some of the famous visitors you recall? I 
had lots of those. One time I had five governors in

23:14.493 --> 23:16.234
there. I had the Texas governor, the New Mexico 
governor, and three Mexican governors in there at

23:17.636 --> 23:27.006
one time. I had lots of celebrities that had been in 
and out.

23:40.973 --> 23:48.064
had

23:40.973 --> 23:48.064
politicians of all kinds. I mean,

23:48.245 --> 24:06.694
Jimmy Carter was there before he was president, 
John Connolly, all of the Kennedy clan,

24:07.670 --> 24:08.972
distaff side. And Lady Bird was a regular down 
there with her family. And let's

24:16.422 --> 24:20.748
see.

24:25.174 --> 24:26.575
I'll never forget the time. Now this is an unlikely 
combination when the Roy Rogers and Jack Dempsey.

24:36.566 --> 24:38.628
Now, would you imagine those two together? A 
friend of mine down there was having them down to go

24:39.969 --> 24:46.335
hunting with him. And he brought them across the 
river and told me that he was going to come across

24:48.157 --> 24:54.623
with them. And he said, I want you to do something 
for me. And he told me what it was. And I said, OK. So

25:01.045 --> 25:11.715
they came in that morning just about the time I was 
opening up and he introduced me naturally to them

25:01.045 --> 25:11.715
and I said, what did you gentlemen like to drink? 
And Dempsey said, I don't know, an old-fashioned

25:11.935 --> 25:17.520
or something. He said, I'd like an old-fashioned. 
And so Roy Rogers says, I'd like a Sarsaparilla.

25:26.188 --> 25:26.969
And I said, yes, sir. And I reached down and handed 
it to him. We didn't normally have them, but he had

25:31.319 --> 25:36.365
tipped me off ahead of time that that's what he was 
going to ask for. Well, I'm going to tell you that

25:37.045 --> 25:44.714
guy's eyes got about that big, because he really 
didn't expect anybody to have a source of perilla.

25:48.498 --> 25:51.701
But anyway, Phil Harris used to come quite often. 
He loved to hunt quail, and he'd come down there.

25:56.733 --> 26:01.418
Now that's a guy that could handle that booze and 
not show it at all. He's something else. Come in and

26:03.760 --> 26:08.185
he'd think, I'll have a double Jack Black. And 
Dizzy Dean. Of

26:13.670 --> 26:22.099
all the famous people that came, who was the most 
enjoyable?

26:24.593 --> 26:27.416
the most pleasant, positive? Probably Leo 
Carrillo.

26:34.104 --> 26:45.919
He was,

26:34.104 --> 26:45.919
of course, being Mexican, he had that ambience 
with all of the people that worked there and

26:34.104 --> 26:45.919
everything. And I remember

26:45.959 --> 26:52.947
one time somebody asked him, Of course, you have to 
really understand the vernacular, but somebody

26:53.298 --> 27:00.208
asked him, says, are you Spanish, Mr. Carrillo? He 
said, no, I'm puro pelado. Pelado literally means

27:05.616 --> 27:15.370
hair, but pelado is just part of the group or the 
barrio or something. I'm one of the people. That's

27:16.252 --> 27:17.213
right. He said, no, yo soy puro pelado. Did any of 
the celebrities ever become troublesome? No, not

27:26.979 --> 27:27.960
really. Never did. Never did. The

27:29.562 --> 27:42.715
nearest one was

27:29.562 --> 27:42.715
John, I've

27:29.562 --> 27:42.715
forgotten his name. I've forgotten his last name 
now. I remember he played in in the movie The Flying

27:49.019 --> 28:01.528
Tigers with

27:49.019 --> 28:01.528
John Wayne, he was the pilot that was a hot shot or 
something. I can't remember what his last name is.

28:04.294 --> 28:04.935
John Carroll. John Carroll. He was a little but it 
was not really bad. All right, so you were managing

28:12.986 --> 28:18.511
that from 48 till when? 47, well, the last part of 47 
till I retired in 1980. I actually, I gave it to my

28:24.317 --> 28:31.404
employees when I left. And Aggies knew where it 
was. Oh, yes. I mean, Gus, Morris

28:41.500 --> 28:47.749
always said, now this is the Aggie table. He didn't 
tell everybody that. When you go down there, you go

28:49.352 --> 28:51.194
to the Aggie table.

28:54.119 --> 28:58.886
Oh, he was a great bunch. Well, I'm about to the end 
of the questions I can think of. And here are some

29:07.018 --> 29:09.381
kind of summary questions.

29:11.707 --> 29:17.175
What has it meant to your life that you attended 
Texas A&M? What difference has it made? All the

29:22.683 --> 29:25.367
difference in the world. I can't think of any one 
happening.

29:34.133 --> 29:46.608
that has probably had a bigger influence, other 
than family or children, but I can't think of

29:34.133 --> 29:46.608
anything that had a bigger influence on my life. 
What did you learn at Texas A&M? We're talking

29:52.856 --> 29:53.977
about learn now. I know what you mean. I know what 
you mean.

30:02.652 --> 30:04.634
I think I learned to judge people.

30:08.178 --> 30:20.271
I really, if

30:08.178 --> 30:20.271
I'd say I have any quality, I would think I'm a 
pretty good judge of people.

30:24.575 --> 30:29.741
So what are the qualities of being a good Aggie? Beg 
your pardon? a good Aggie has what kind of

30:31.913 --> 30:34.115
qualities?

30:42.224 --> 30:43.005
Well, he's true. He's

30:43.065 --> 31:00.605
true to himself,

30:43.065 --> 31:00.605
and he's true to his friends,

30:43.065 --> 31:00.605
and he's

30:43.065 --> 31:00.605
responsible. He's truly He's just a true man, 
that's all. Let's make believe that someone walks

31:09.974 --> 31:23.318
to your door tomorrow and hands you a check for a 
million dollars and attaches only one condition

31:09.974 --> 31:23.318
to that check.
