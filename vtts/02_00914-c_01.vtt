WEBVTT

00:02.225 --> 00:31.455
The towns included New Boston, Clarksville,

00:02.225 --> 00:31.455
Allen, Texas,

00:02.225 --> 00:31.455
Woodway,

00:02.225 --> 00:31.455
then studies for a number of independent 
individuals not associated with some of the

00:02.225 --> 00:31.455
cities, and then for the city of Lakeside and the 
Fort Worth area, or Lake I'm sorry, Lake Worth

00:32.195 --> 00:38.944
Village, which was at Lakeside. And for the Lake 
Worth Independent School District planning

00:38.964 --> 00:54.444
study, that's a school district located at the 
north end of the approach into Carswell Air Force

00:38.964 --> 00:54.444
Base. And so there was a certain amount of activity 
I had through the north Texas area working on a

01:01.439 --> 01:05.424
contractual basis for some of these towns. That 
was under the old 701 planning program. Now, let's

01:09.249 --> 01:13.695
go back to the education area, and let me just 
comment a little bit. The Federation of North

01:16.138 --> 01:23.608
Texas Area Universities consists of North Texas, 
East Texas, and Texas Women's University, as I

01:16.138 --> 01:23.608
already mentioned. The program there is focused 
on merging together in terms of degrees and

01:30.515 --> 01:47.091
hopefully course offerings, the delivery 
system, the whole combination of things, a

01:30.515 --> 01:47.091
unified, coordinated set of offerings in various 
fields. Each field comes up before the

01:47.291 --> 01:55.979
Coordinating Board for its own independent 
approval. The graduate program in adult

01:55.999 --> 02:00.403
continuing ed was approved in 1974, April 74, to

02:01.345 --> 02:16.886
give authorization for the awarding of MA, MS, 
MED, PhD, and EDDs at all three of the

02:01.345 --> 02:16.886
institutions.

02:19.950 --> 02:22.113
This was one of the programs. Typically, some 
others included psychology. They've included

02:26.959 --> 02:29.783
areas like early childhood studies. They have 
included programs in, at one time, I believe, in

02:30.218 --> 02:37.887
chemistry and so forth. Most of these have been 
within the area of education, but not totally.

02:42.133 --> 02:45.116
There are, for instance, some in vocational 
technical training.

02:47.980 --> 03:00.175
One of the things that we have striven for is to find 
ways within our ACED committee to bring together

02:47.980 --> 03:00.175
the scheduling of classes and getting 
established common admission standards,

03:00.813 --> 03:18.078
getting a common core of courses, course 
descriptions that would be the same at all three

03:00.813 --> 03:18.078
institutions. And of course, that means titles as 
well. Getting examinations administered on a

03:22.204 --> 03:30.195
three university basis, rather than each one 
doing its own under some sort of local

03:30.479 --> 03:36.826
departmental guideline. We are aware within this 
group, in adult continuing ed, that we have quite

03:37.206 --> 03:58.208
presently a diversity of orientations to the 
handling of doctoral exams, ranging all the way

03:37.206 --> 03:58.208
from three-day written exams to one-day written 
exams. North Texas, for instance, has a half-day

03:58.947 --> 04:05.014
proficiency exam in research tools. We at East 
Texas rely on coursework to take care of those

04:07.477 --> 04:16.707
research proficiency tool requirements. TWU has 
a different set of criteria. They use core courses

04:19.170 --> 04:26.018
for examination along the way before the student 
ever gets admitted to doctoral exams. We are

04:27.314 --> 04:52.345
attempting right now, and the adult continuing ed 
committee is very active presently and during

04:27.314 --> 04:52.345
this academic year of 85-86, with the support of 
the graduate deans, with the support of the vice

04:27.314 --> 04:52.345
presidents, with the support of the presidents of 
the three institutions, to move forward on

04:27.314 --> 04:52.345
unifying the entire approach. The nearest 
program unifies its approach Maybe there are two.

04:59.347 --> 05:19.568
Early childhood for one in terms of the 
promotional aspects of the program and

04:59.347 --> 05:19.568
psychology from the standpoint of the course 
requirements and masters and doctoral

04:59.347 --> 05:19.568
examination requirements.

05:20.809 --> 05:24.253
Those are perhaps the hallmarks of those two 
programs. early childhood, for example. I think

05:26.965 --> 05:29.668
planners need to be thinking in these terms. That 
program has brought in specialists in the early

05:31.571 --> 05:37.339
childhood field. And the programs that they have 
developed have been of interest to people from not

05:38.801 --> 05:50.597
only all over North Texas, the East Texas area, but 
generally across the state. And folks will come

05:50.697 --> 05:54.662
in, even from Corpus Christi and other such 
points, to hear these national and sometimes

05:54.997 --> 06:02.144
internationally known figures speaking on 
problems of early childhood. I see the same

06:02.164 --> 06:23.485
potential application for the federation of the 
graduate schools of planning bringing in people

06:02.164 --> 06:23.485
of international stature because planners from 
all over the state of Texas and beyond the

06:02.164 --> 06:23.485
boundaries would be interested if those people 
were going to be here for or in Austin or wherever

06:02.164 --> 06:23.485
for a one-day seminar. It could be very, very 
appealing, very attractive. And, in fact, early

06:27.244 --> 06:46.744
childhood has made money on this, and they 
consistently have a kitty of $2,000 to $5,000 that

06:27.244 --> 06:46.744
they can use to promote their programs and to 
guarantee honorariums and so on and travel

06:27.244 --> 06:46.744
expenses and lodging and so on. And that's a very 
good thing, I think, as a service to professionals

06:46.764 --> 06:53.151
in the state And to my way of thinking, the planners 
in the state would be very interested in hearing

06:53.992 --> 07:03.023
individuals of international renown. This would 
be non-state funds also. That's right. It's

07:06.547 --> 07:07.829
non-state funds. So it's not subject to line item 
vetoes either, or budget funds. You have complete

07:12.995 --> 07:16.479
freedom on what you spend it on as well. Right. Now 
the interesting thing is that our federation has a

07:22.055 --> 07:24.317
certain amount of basic funding. And the 
Federation, the Council of Presidents, as they

07:25.739 --> 07:40.894
are called, in turn, on recommendations of the 
graduate deans and the vice presidents, make

07:25.739 --> 07:40.894
decisions as to where small amounts of money 
should go to various programs. It may be $200 or

07:41.234 --> 07:49.262
$500 or $700 or $800 for the year for a program 
committee, such as Adult Continuing Ed. But early

07:50.424 --> 07:51.825
childhood. has taken that money and they have spun 
off these programs, which have become enormously

07:52.227 --> 08:01.001
popular and successful. And as a matter of fact, 
they turn around in some cases and even arrange for

08:01.402 --> 08:08.493
students to enroll in one hour courses. Sometimes 
these seminars will be five day, full time, five

08:09.635 --> 08:17.728
day seminars. And students can even enroll for 
credit or for continuing education units. And of

08:23.679 --> 08:33.433
course, from the standpoint of a practicing 
professional in the planting field, the CEUs

08:23.679 --> 08:33.433
could be a way of encouraging them to come in. Well, 
you know, the Educational Foundation is charged

08:34.435 --> 08:41.185
with the educational function of the chapter. And 
the only real activity that they've undertaken

08:41.772 --> 08:52.423
continually is the short course for planning 
commissioners and elected public officials. And

08:53.424 --> 09:03.595
there's always been talk of

08:53.424 --> 09:03.595
continuing education for degreed planners. And 
this has never happened. Well, this would be a

09:06.238 --> 09:09.822
place where

09:11.017 --> 09:28.001
the institutions could, on a cooperative basis 
with the Education Foundation, come together and

09:11.017 --> 09:28.001
offer programs that would help the practicing 
professional and others who are skilled, whether

09:11.017 --> 09:28.001
they be in private practice or public practice. 
Another thing that has always been talked about is

09:28.021 --> 09:38.256
getting together a unit that could be used 
throughout Texas in high school. usually we're

09:38.962 --> 10:07.517
thinking lately about the junior year rather than 
the senior year, and have this available with a

09:38.962 --> 10:07.517
member of AICP to be there with the canned product, 
as it were, that would be in some media form, and to

09:38.962 --> 10:07.517
carry on a conversation and a discussion of it 
Yeah, I think that should be done, especially

10:07.767 --> 10:15.656
because the high schools have their career days 
very regularly. There are lots of them here in the

10:15.696 --> 10:19.720
Dallas-Fort Worth area. And it's a very popular 
kind of event. I think planning needs to be very

10:24.286 --> 10:31.834
much more concerned with recruiting high level. 
entries into the profession. Let me comment on one

10:34.957 --> 10:37.000
other aspect of that. And this is something that I 
have touched on earlier. But I think that the

10:41.667 --> 11:01.517
planning programs, in terms of the content of the 
curriculum, but more especially in the working

10:41.667 --> 11:01.517
arrangement, the programs need to be giving some 
serious consideration to it. I have had

11:02.932 --> 11:28.230
opportunity to observe both those programs that 
are operated

11:02.932 --> 11:28.230
within and at the level of a single department 
program versus, on the other hand, those programs

11:02.932 --> 11:28.230
that are operated in a coordinated fashion 
embracing several departments. There are

11:29.864 --> 11:39.219
weaknesses in the multidisciplinary approach 
from the standpoint of program control and

11:29.864 --> 11:39.219
management. Those, though, in my judgment, can be 
overcome. And people in continuing education

11:42.624 --> 11:46.930
have that same kind of problem. I didn't get rid of 
those problems when I left. The planning field

11:50.656 --> 11:54.442
actively moved over to education. But I must say, 
candidly, I see some serious weaknesses in the

11:59.108 --> 12:27.057
folks coming out of the graduate programs in 
planning in being so singular in focus, whether it

11:59.108 --> 12:27.057
be an urban design selectivity or an urban 
analysis selectivity or whatever you might want

11:59.108 --> 12:27.057
to name it, an administrative selectivity. that 
they don't seem to have the inadequate

12:27.357 --> 12:35.804
understanding of the total dimension of the 
field. I don't mean expertise in all these areas.

12:38.707 --> 12:43.551
But they don't seem to have a good, solid 
understanding of the other side. They do get some

12:43.992 --> 12:53.400
theoretical exposure, as I see it in most of these 
programs, but some understanding of the working

12:43.992 --> 12:53.400
tools in the other disciplines. For example,

12:57.968 --> 13:26.710
and not challenging the program at A&M, but simply 
pointing out by way of asking the question, do the

12:57.968 --> 13:26.710
students in the graduate program at A&M get an 
exposure to population statistics and the

12:57.968 --> 13:26.710
analysis of demographic data from a statistical 
point of view that a demographer will say, yes,

12:57.968 --> 13:26.710
that person's on the right track. do they get that 
same exposure to public administration case

13:27.955 --> 13:49.599
analysis whereby the person who is a practicing 
public administrator with a background in public

13:27.955 --> 13:49.599
administration will be able to say, yes, that 
person has correctly approached the analysis of

13:27.955 --> 13:49.599
these case studies. That's the kind of thing I'm 
talking about. Would the geographer, the

13:52.703 --> 13:57.608
experienced qualified geographer, be able to 
say, yes, the procedures that are being followed

13:57.976 --> 14:07.205
in the analysis of the geographic implications 
have been correctly addressed.

14:10.769 --> 14:25.624
The theoretical base is important, but I think the 
thing that I find so often missing is that the

14:10.769 --> 14:25.624
student doesn't really appreciate exactly what 
it is the person in the other field is expecting

14:10.769 --> 14:25.624
from a performance standpoint. It's not the lack 
of theoretical base, It's the understanding of

14:28.216 --> 14:35.346
how the geographer should work in the situation. 
There is professional methodologies. Yes, it's

14:38.050 --> 14:50.748
the professional methodologies with kind of a 
fundamental understanding of the underlying

14:38.050 --> 14:50.748
theory, but not totally absorbed by the 
underlying theory. Flabel Shurtleff, years ago,

14:50.828 --> 14:55.995
when he was very active in AIP, gave a talk at Long 
Beach, which I remember very well, sitting in a

14:57.089 --> 15:15.076
room of about 35 or 40 people and listening to him 
expound on the problems that he had done, kind of a

14:57.089 --> 15:15.076
joint effort at MIT and Harvard, talking of . You 
were in Long Beach. OK. In that Long Beach session.

15:23.397 --> 15:48.941
He presented the results of a study that had been 
done reaching across both academic and

15:23.397 --> 15:48.941
practitioner lines, trying to identify courses 
and content areas that individuals felt a

15:23.397 --> 15:48.941
graduate program in planning should have under 
the belt before going into private practice. And

15:48.961 --> 15:50.282
he said, we eliminated not only the duplications, 
but also those various areas that seemed to be

15:50.752 --> 15:58.220
rather minuscule. And he said, we then put 
semester hours or quarter hours credits on it,

15:58.240 --> 16:06.068
added it all up. And he said, for a person who would 
enter a graduate program in planning, say, at age

16:06.308 --> 16:19.341
22 or 23, maybe with a couple of years experience 
under the belt, maybe age 25 or 26, He said, we found

16:21.059 --> 16:26.808
that the person would be 72 years old if they took 
all the required courses. Beautiful. Beautiful,

16:28.130 --> 16:29.352
yeah. I'm not surprised. Well, obviously, this is 
a horrendous problem. I guess my plea is that the

16:36.823 --> 16:48.501
people have some understanding of, as you put it, 
the methodologies that give the planner

16:49.578 --> 16:55.183
recognition by counterparts in the other fields 
that they are connected with. It's not that they

16:56.824 --> 17:04.651
know all of the nitty gritty details, but that 
their methodological approaches sound. Because

17:04.671 --> 17:08.434
that's the thing I have found consistently so 
often. For instance, people coming out of urban

17:08.514 --> 17:19.483
design programs, relatively little 
understanding of how the geographer works, how

17:08.514 --> 17:19.483
the sociologist works. Almost

17:19.683 --> 17:25.490
no understanding of communication skills. And 
this is terrible. Probably the greatest

17:27.492 --> 17:30.856
weaknesses in that area. And certainly no 
understanding of how final decisions are made.

17:35.441 --> 17:36.202
No, no. The political process is just... Out to 
lunch. Gone. Totally gone. And a lot of them

17:42.049 --> 17:45.773
stumble and fall because of that. Or they get 
frustrated with it. And there's no reason for

17:50.092 --> 17:52.314
that. They need to recognize the process. Kent 
kept homing in on process in his writings about how

17:57.659 --> 18:05.826
you have to do this and this and this. And I think 
it's a point that you have to be constantly aware

18:08.248 --> 18:13.653
of. Planning is not something done in a vacuum. 
It's got to be done with the people. How do you feel

18:20.348 --> 18:31.184
that the three recognized schools should relate 
to each other in Texas? My feeling would be that

18:32.846 --> 18:47.267
they ought to put together a united front as a 
consortium, a consortium of planning schools, or

18:32.846 --> 18:47.267
I should use that instead of federation, because I 
think it might make a stronger approach that One,

18:48.395 --> 18:56.323
there would be first an acceptance of certain core 
courses, especially that first year of graduate

18:48.395 --> 18:56.323
study. And then second, that there would be, 
because of the core, those core courses with

18:58.145 --> 19:11.760
common agreement on substance, content, 
description, would then be transferable from one

18:58.145 --> 19:11.760
institution to the other. But beyond that, that 
there would then also be agreement leadership

19:17.572 --> 19:27.363
provided by all three schools in furnishing work 
experience, on-site experience in various

19:17.572 --> 19:27.363
locales in the state. And I don't care where it is. 
That would be up to the institution and the student

19:30.226 --> 19:32.889
needs. But I think beyond that, it would be very 
helpful if in the final review of students,

19:43.913 --> 20:12.351
probably the end of the third semester of their 
graduate study, that there could be an evaluation

19:43.913 --> 20:12.351
step, maybe near the end of that third semester or 
just before they go into the fourth, an evaluation

19:43.913 --> 20:12.351
step where faculty from all three institutions 
would come together and review the work of all of

19:43.913 --> 20:12.351
those third semester students and say, here are 
the strengths, here are the weaknesses, this

20:12.618 --> 20:17.083
student needs to get some special attention, not 
necessarily another course. But in that fourth

20:17.764 --> 20:21.749
semester, hone in on this particular area. Mike at 
A&M, I recognize the need for some kind of review of

20:23.511 --> 20:34.124
the student's work prior to the final oral exam. 
Right. That's what I'm talking about. And so I

20:35.986 --> 20:40.532
instituted the midpoint review. The midpoint 
review is not intended as an exam, but as a review of

20:41.339 --> 21:07.549
the student's work and to try to take a look at 
anything that needed bolstering up during the

20:41.339 --> 21:07.549
last half of his or her academic career, and also a 
chance for the student to voice any aspirations

20:41.339 --> 21:07.549
for the department, anything that might have been 
hoped for that didn't come to fruition, wasn't

21:07.850 --> 21:14.519
realized, that would help the department. And of 
course, that's a very difficult thing for the

21:15.140 --> 21:20.988
student to do, because they're still there and 
they're still being graded. But I understand what

21:22.190 --> 21:26.616
you're saying. But on the basis of a consortium of 
three institutions that would make that a bit more

21:27.497 --> 21:37.030
meaningful, I think it would from the standpoint 
that these people are not going to continue to work

21:37.904 --> 21:44.854
in College Station or Ryan. And therefore, 
they're going to be competing with graduates from

21:45.835 --> 21:55.189
the other institutions in San Antonio, in 
Houston, in Corpus, Dallas, Fort Worth, and other

21:45.835 --> 21:55.189
points. Also, it would make it very much more of a 
professional type of review. Yes. And that's what

22:01.258 --> 22:07.827
my concern is, that it not be an academic grading 
process it not be the jury, but rather it be a

22:08.330 --> 22:29.181
professional relationship between

22:08.330 --> 22:29.181
individuals in the institutions almost 
representing the role of prospective employers

22:08.330 --> 22:29.181
and the students as prospective workers. And 
therefore, bringing those two together in that

22:30.222 --> 22:34.168
context so that the student would be able to say at 
the end of the program, collectively, in the

22:34.958 --> 22:52.222
wisdom of the faculty in the three institutions, I 
have done what they said I needed to do in order to be

22:34.958 --> 22:52.222
ready for the field. The only thing I would add to 
this is that I think there must be somebody from a

22:52.903 --> 23:02.316
practicing professional, maybe from a private 
operation and someone from a public operation sit

23:02.768 --> 23:08.617
in on that consortium review of those students. I 
feel that's essential in order to be sure that

23:09.398 --> 23:25.241
because of the mix of faculty maybe in that review 
process, things don't get warped one way or

23:09.398 --> 23:25.241
another and get out of context with what goes on in 
practice. That's why we have a representative of

23:25.261 --> 23:30.669
the graduate college on our PhD committee. Right. 
Sure. just to ensure fairness. Right. This

23:34.977 --> 23:45.010
reminds me of the relationship in planning 
between Harvard and MIT, where one can take

23:34.977 --> 23:45.010
courses at either institution for credit. Right. 
And if they can do it, I can see no reason why we in our

23:46.172 --> 23:54.082
own state under one coordinating board for higher 
education couldn't accomplish it. Right. And I

23:54.323 --> 23:59.029
think the coordinating board would be the vehicle 
to accomplish a consortium. Yeah. To me, it's the

24:00.059 --> 24:01.821
logical thing. It would mean that the deans of the 
schools or the graduate deans, perhaps more

24:02.061 --> 24:16.596
specifically, and the VPs and presidents could 
really be the parent body. Well, I think it might be

24:17.357 --> 24:22.642
very realistic to think in these terms right now 
with the budget crunch. Yes. And you see, that's

24:23.062 --> 24:26.766
what has happened with the adult continuing ed 
program. And that is, although the budget crunch

24:26.786 --> 24:29.509
hadn't surfaced as visible. It was 1 tenth of the 
tip of the iceberg that was shown. But everybody

24:36.952 --> 24:40.977
was aware that something could happen. We were 
already under constraints in the three schools

24:40.997 --> 24:45.163
about hiring additional people. Now we're at the 
constraint of don't hire replacements. We were

24:50.771 --> 24:56.138
really feeling, and I say this from the standpoint 
of faculty and had felt for a number of years a

24:57.350 --> 25:23.264
desire to get together, what we are now

24:57.350 --> 25:23.264
finding is that we now have the attention of the 
vice presidents and the presidents who are

24:57.350 --> 25:23.264
saying, uh-oh, we better find a way to maximize the 
capabilities of the faculties in these three

24:57.350 --> 25:23.264
institutions. And mind you, we're only talking 
about myself full time. and a part-time faculty

25:26.695 --> 25:46.453
member at East Texas, one full-time person at TW 
who will be leaving at the end of this year, and one

25:26.695 --> 25:46.453
other full-time and a couple of part-time people 
maybe doing one course per semester in the area,

25:26.695 --> 25:46.453
and only one at North Texas. So we're talking only 
about a very few faculty. Yeah. Paragraph. Mike,

25:52.258 --> 25:56.162
would you care to comment on the Kessler 
contribution to the planning of Fort Worth?

26:01.383 --> 26:10.252
Interestingly, when I was there as planning 
director, we dug out some of the old material from

26:01.383 --> 26:10.252
the Kessler studies, the Kessler planning work.

26:13.276 --> 26:25.609
I found very little, very little knowledge of 
Kessler ever having done work in Fort Worth by the

26:13.276 --> 26:25.609
man or woman on the street. That was unlike the 
situation in El Paso, where I talked with a great

26:26.146 --> 26:39.057
many people who remembered Kessler as a very 
dynamic individual. He came in. He was involved.

26:41.259 --> 26:42.600
He talked with local groups. In fact, I had people 
tell me that they remembered 25 years earlier

26:43.001 --> 26:52.248
having gone to a public meeting where Kessler 
spoke. I never encountered that in Fort Worth. I

26:56.082 --> 27:03.473
don't know why, whether I just didn't bump into the 
right people, did not meet them, maybe they were

26:56.082 --> 27:03.473
gone. Herman Cox, who was the chairman of the 
Planning Commission when I went to Fort Worth, may

27:04.394 --> 27:14.850
have had some contact with Kessler years before. 
But seemingly, the impression was just very nil.

27:20.659 --> 27:24.064
And we resuscitated part of his work for an exhibit 
that we put on in Fort Worth. Where that material is

27:27.743 --> 27:29.925
today, I do not know. We had also done a study. In 
fact, a review of the Kessler material was

27:33.408 --> 27:51.425
prompted in part because shortly after I went 
there, we were doing a study on trying to find some

27:33.408 --> 27:51.425
way to bring the four railroads together into 
common terminal facilities and so on. It did not

27:51.605 --> 27:53.967
meet with success. One of them, MoTak, turned 
around deliberately and started to enlarge their

27:54.892 --> 28:06.026
own facility so they wouldn't get trapped into 
doing something with the Santa Fe.

28:06.046 --> 28:07.948
At least that's my assessment of it. They expanded 
in any case. Mike, this may take the record as the

28:10.551 --> 28:13.595
longest interview. I'm afraid so. We covered a lot 
of cities in the process and a lot of topics. And I

28:18.942 --> 28:23.127
want to thank you for your time and your 
contribution of the Texas chapter of APA. Quite

28:26.749 --> 28:27.431
welcome. And this closes out the interview. If I 
could ever do anything with the foundation, I'd be

28:29.114 --> 28:32.801
glad to do it. And if there's anything on promotion 
of the programs in the state for continuing into

28:32.842 --> 28:39.154
the planners, I'd certainly be welcome. Look upon 
that as a very welcome opportunity. Thank you.
