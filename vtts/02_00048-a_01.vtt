WEBVTT

00:03.389 --> 00:13.263
And I have the pleasure of being in Corpus Christi 
and chatting with Dick Connolly, the president of

00:03.389 --> 00:13.263
the association 1958 and 1959. Now I'll stop and 
hope that the machine is working.

00:25.440 --> 00:27.102
Mr. Connolly, as we begin, Tell me, why did you go to 
A&M? How did you happen to get to A&M in the first

00:31.079 --> 00:33.562
place? Well, back in the days of the time I 
graduated from high school in 1931, there were

00:35.084 --> 00:57.274
tough times for most people, and my father had gone 
through two very serious business failures. One

00:59.502 --> 01:03.506
due to World War I in Athens, Georgia where I was 
born. He was an automobile dealer. When the war

01:07.049 --> 01:14.016
came along, he could no longer get cars and his 
business folded as a result. He picked Palm Beach,

01:15.538 --> 01:25.708
Florida to go to get into the real estate business 
for seeking hopefully to get a place where he could

01:26.498 --> 01:34.690
make a living for his four children and my mother 
Dixie. There we lived for about four years during

01:36.213 --> 01:52.337
the Florida boom but again there were two Florida 
hurricanes came along and a boom burst in Venice

01:36.213 --> 01:52.337
and Wall Street and it was jumping out of windows 
and his business there folded, so he picked Corpus

01:52.958 --> 01:57.385
Christi, Texas. That's going a long way around to 
tell you how tough things were for us and many other

01:57.405 --> 02:05.317
people in those days, but he couldn't help me go to 
college. So when I graduated, I was working as a

02:14.963 --> 02:22.251
shipping autoclick for the Ranges Converse 
Company here in Corpus Christi, watching the

02:14.963 --> 02:22.251
boats go in and out of our harbor. And I was 
fortunate enough to have a friend who I thought

02:23.413 --> 02:38.350
might know some of the Likes brothers, Ripley 
Steamship Company people, and she did, Mr. Roy,

02:23.413 --> 02:38.350
Ms. Roy Miller, who at that time was, I believe, the 
mayor of the city. Anyway, he got me a job and I spent

02:39.191 --> 02:42.034
two years nearly two years at sea as a deck boy and 
ordinary seaman, which was a great experience,

02:42.014 --> 02:52.586
but still didn't get me to make me enough money to go 
to college. One day I was dating a very lovely girl

02:54.208 --> 03:01.496
named Bernice Wilder, the daughter of a state road 
contractor. I came to pick her up late one

03:04.913 --> 03:19.290
afternoon to take her to a picture show at a summer 
fair and was met by her father, Harry Wilder, at the

03:04.913 --> 03:19.290
door and said to come in and that Bernice would be 
down shortly. So we went out on the porch, didn't

03:21.092 --> 03:32.406
have any air conditioning back in those days, and 
sat in the swing and we visited a bit and he said,

03:21.092 --> 03:32.406
Dick, why don't you go to college? I said, well, Mr. 
Wilder, I haven't been able to afford to go to

03:33.922 --> 03:37.567
college. I'd love to go to college. He said, well, 
if you had a job at Texas A&M, say, for instance,

03:39.650 --> 03:45.619
could you go to college? I said, Mr. Wilder, if I had 
a job, I could make it anywhere. And he put his arm

03:52.189 --> 04:03.085
around my shoulder and took me to the bottom of the 
stairs of his home there and picked up the

03:52.189 --> 04:03.085
telephone and dialed some numbers and Got Bob 
Ferguson, the governor at that time, on the line.

04:08.496 --> 04:15.950
After swapping a few pleasances with her, he said, 
Miss Ferguson, I have a young friend that I'm very

04:08.496 --> 04:15.950
interested in. I'd like to see him have the 
opportunity to go to college. I wonder if you could

04:20.920 --> 04:25.849
get him a job at Texas A&M this coming fall. They 
talked back and forth and he hung up, put his arm

04:26.774 --> 04:34.704
around me and he says, now, Nick, you've got a job at 
A&M. You go up there. And so on the strength of that,

04:36.867 --> 04:51.246
no letter, no any other thing, I hitchhiked for 
motor transportation mainly back in those days

04:36.867 --> 04:51.246
with my big suitcase. I got into A&M about sundown, 
I remember, late one evening. The first, as I

04:58.081 --> 05:10.585
walked in from the old train station there on the 
highway, heading toward Old Main, the first

04:58.081 --> 05:10.585
building on my left was Law Hall. That's where the A 
Troop Cavalry was. That was one of the best the good

05:14.345 --> 05:19.956
Lord was looking after me because I went in there 
and asked directions. They said, well, come right

05:20.016 --> 05:21.679
on in here. We got a bunk for you. So I joined the A 
Troop Cavalry at that time. Well, the second day

05:28.973 --> 05:32.320
after I registered, My name was called over the 
loudspeaker at Savisa Hall, I believe it is, at

05:33.211 --> 05:40.518
West Hall, Cadet R.N. Connolly, report to 
Secretary S.G. Bailey at the main administration

05:40.538 --> 05:47.264
building. Well, I had to get directions where to go 
down there, and I, right after lunch, I walked down

05:48.505 --> 06:03.218
and walked into that beautiful new 
administration building, which, thank

05:48.505 --> 06:03.218
goodness, has recently been named the Jack 
Williamson Building. I was amazed at his beauty,

06:03.198 --> 06:13.571
and I overcome with it, really, and I walked up 
those parallel stairs to Mr. Bailey's office. I

06:14.793 --> 06:24.506
was rushing in by his secretary, and I looked at Mr. 
Bailey, and he looked at me, and he said, Son, are

06:14.793 --> 06:24.506
you Cadet R.N. Connolly? I said, Yes, sir, Mr. 
Bailey. He said, well, son, you've got some

06:29.017 --> 06:34.345
powerful friends. So through the goodness of a 
friend, Harry Wilder, and his friendship with

06:34.365 --> 06:49.508
Governor Mark Ferguson, I had a job from the day I 
entered A&M to the day I left. It wasn't an easy job.

06:53.182 --> 06:58.289
because I had to get up around 4.30 or 5 every 
morning and sweep. My building was the old civil

06:58.709 --> 07:01.172
engineering building. That was my 
responsibility. I swept it from top to bottom,

07:04.657 --> 07:15.291
cleaned the waste paper baskets, and on 
Saturdays, cleaned the windows, trimmed the

07:04.657 --> 07:15.291
shrubs, cut the grass, if I remember, and cleaned 
the crappers. Let's see, describe that trip from

07:17.532 --> 07:23.379
Corpus Christi to College Station, that first 
trip. Did you go the whole way by train or hitchhike

07:23.900 --> 07:27.504
part of it? Well, my father wanted, was so proud 
that I was going to A&M. He had gone to the

07:33.351 --> 07:39.378
University of Georgia two years, but had left to go 
into business for himself. But he had to go to

07:40.279 --> 07:45.025
Houston on business, so he took me as far as 
Hempstead, I believe, or Hempstead, and let me out

07:46.996 --> 07:59.167
there and I hitchhiked with my big suitcase. What 
did you have in that suitcase? What did a freshman

08:01.909 --> 08:04.792
take to college in that era? Back in those days, you 
know, not much different than it is today, I don't

08:05.973 --> 08:14.961
imagine, in that sense I had Knowing that I was 
going to go, really wanted to go into the Corps, I

08:15.616 --> 08:23.345
researched that a little bit and the government 
was going to be furnishing me a uniform. I had the

08:24.867 --> 08:27.009
best of whatever way I had. I had a good suit in there 
and a lot of changes of shirt and underwear and

08:27.029 --> 08:38.603
whatever I felt like I needed but haven't been a 
deck boy, an ordinary seaman on a ship, I learned to

08:38.583 --> 08:49.313
get around and get along with very little in a way of 
fancy clothes. Please describe the campus when

08:50.714 --> 08:54.277
you arrived physically. What buildings were 
there and where were they? Where did people live?

09:01.484 --> 09:08.050
Well, you know, back in those days, we had a 
relatively small student body. It was probably

09:08.705 --> 09:16.954
around 6,000, maybe 6,500 if I'm not mistaken. And 
we each had this, we were all military and we had a

09:16.974 --> 09:36.735
rather versatile military organization there 
with many different types of choices. I picked the

09:36.755 --> 09:37.716
cavalry. Because before you went up there, I had 
made up my mind that's where I wanted to go because I

09:38.152 --> 09:53.047
loved horses and to me it was the elite service, 
just like the Air Force later became the, you might

09:38.152 --> 09:53.047
say, the elite service.

09:56.551 --> 10:04.159
But the law hall was right next to another hall. I 
can't remember all those hall numbers, right

10:04.477 --> 10:14.171
close to the YMCA, which was a very important focal 
point on the campus in those days. Down in the

10:14.211 --> 10:32.678
basement, Casey had his Sparks, and if I'm not 
mistaken, there was a barbershop down there, and

10:14.211 --> 10:32.678
they had their pharmacy where we could go down and 
get a milkshake every now and then, but mainly we

10:14.211 --> 10:32.678
made friends quickly with Sparks and Casey. Casey 
particularly was a great individual, and I'll

10:33.451 --> 10:39.837
have to tell you a story about Casey later. But to 
answer your story, a lot of the buildings that were

10:40.257 --> 10:46.383
there then have been torn down now. Old Main was 
there. Many of our classes were in Old Main. And the

10:51.408 --> 10:59.796
headquarters for the university were down in the 
new administration building pretty well. They

11:00.164 --> 11:18.086
didn't have a system back in those days, or any 
system building of course, but we did have a

11:00.164 --> 11:18.086
coliseum there for,

11:00.164 --> 11:18.086
we had our intramural athletics. The intramural 
athletics formed a big part of taking the energy

11:18.166 --> 11:26.937
out of those students. We didn't have any women 
around, So we all took parts, and we got up early in

11:30.320 --> 11:37.551
the morning. We went all day, and in the afternoon, 
we had a spare time. We were out there playing

11:41.897 --> 11:45.883
intramural sports. Describe what it was like to be 
a fish in that era. How was a fish treated in his

11:51.920 --> 11:54.403
outfit? Well, they were treated like fish. In a 
sense, newcomers had to be trained. I was never

12:03.792 --> 12:12.141
treated unkindly unless I voted on myself. We had 
the military system that we had as far as my A Troop

12:19.207 --> 12:23.033
Calvary was concerned and what I observed from 
others. They picked good leaders who had good

12:24.315 --> 12:30.985
character and with good leadership roles. I know 
my captain was, my freshman year there was Zeb

12:32.067 --> 12:36.854
Burke. B-U-R-K? B-U-R-K, yeah. And I don't know 
what ever happened to Zeb, but I couldn't stay in

12:42.002 --> 12:47.931
touch with him. His top kick was Ed Neal, who later 
moved to Beeville and was the extension director

12:48.350 --> 13:17.074
there, and a noted

12:48.350 --> 13:17.074
specialist in Hawaiian animal health and did a 
great job at that Beeville Experimental Station

12:48.350 --> 13:17.074
throughout his career, where he ended up and is now 
farming there now. was a very kindly person who

13:17.493 --> 13:25.125
took an interest in all the freshmen and so did 
Frank Schleicher, the top kick to him. And they all

13:25.285 --> 13:30.133
were gentlemen, they all treated you fairly. But 
if you stepped out of line, you could get a whack on

13:30.674 --> 13:34.821
your butt. And I did that occasionally. I stepped 
out of line until I learned that that wasn't the

13:38.086 --> 13:41.551
thing to do. I remember one Sunday morning, I had 
presented up out late at night

13:45.725 --> 13:54.940
on one Saturday night. I figured, well, no one's 
going to be around here Sunday. They're all going

13:57.965 --> 13:58.907
to Austin. I'm just going to lock this door and 
sleep in. And nobody knows the difference. Of

14:05.738 --> 14:11.327
course, I was supposed to be up even on Sunday 
morning and checking to see what the and the top

14:11.763 --> 14:18.672
kicker and the others might need to help them shine 
their shoes and boots and so forth. But so the next

14:18.692 --> 14:33.911
morning when I heard outside, I heard Zeb Berger 
say, oh, Ed Lee, Ed Neal, well, these freshmen, I

14:18.692 --> 14:33.911
need somebody to shine my boots. Oh, I need someone 
to get me some coffee. No answer from anywhere, no

14:39.077 --> 14:41.500
freshmen around. Well, where's Dick Conley? I 
thought he was going to be here this weekend. No

14:51.491 --> 14:53.193
answer. I heard all this behind a locked door. I 
said, oh my gosh. Anyway, Frank said, the top kick

14:59.300 --> 15:06.889
said, well, look, I've got a key to Conley's room. 
I'll go in there and get his polishing kit. And

15:09.932 --> 15:12.735
we'll see if we can clean our own boots. So he opened 
the door and there I was in the sack. Well, they gave

15:18.706 --> 15:22.813
me a lesson that I'll not remember, not forget. And 
I never did anything like that again, but it was a

15:24.876 --> 15:27.780
good lesson. Did you all do duck walks and other 
things like that? Well, you know, they were very

15:35.152 --> 15:40.039
considerate of me because I was working my way 
through school, and they knew it. They knew I was a

15:44.654 --> 15:54.468
janitor, and I got up early every morning, 4.35 or 
4, while they were still in the psych, and they

15:44.654 --> 15:54.468
respected that. And because of that, I was never 
subject to any type of tomfoolery, you might say,

16:03.695 --> 16:11.363
Some of the others didn't have to put up with all in 
the name of good training. But I was getting that

16:11.403 --> 16:17.669
good training another way. Describe a typical day 
of classes from the time you got up till the time you

16:17.689 --> 16:25.657
went to bed that night. What happened when and for 
how long? Well, when the bugle sounded, we were put

16:34.829 --> 16:44.943
on our socks, jumped out of that bed and made it 
quickly in an army style and cleaned up. And then we

16:45.704 --> 16:53.294
raced down to get in line, line up as we had three 
formations a day to go into the mess hall. And

16:53.334 --> 16:54.475
where'd y'all line up? We'd line up right in front 
on the street, right in front of Law Hall. Okay. We

17:01.036 --> 17:27.052
had our top kicks and we had our sergeants who were 
there to keep us in line and we took pride in our

17:01.036 --> 17:27.052
marching and always had as we went into the mess, 
oh, there's a piece of a roar of some song or

17:01.036 --> 17:27.052
something we were singing. It was all a lot of 
camaraderie and Those men who lined up with me were

17:32.373 --> 18:00.809
lifelong friends, like Omar Smith was a 
cavalryman, and Omar went on to have the tennis

17:32.373 --> 18:00.809
court named after him, and I can tell a different 
story about, well, later, about Omar that might

17:32.373 --> 18:00.809
not be a proper place for it here, but those friends 
were lifelong friends. All right, you... You got

18:01.685 --> 18:04.289
up, the Reveille was at what time? Got up usually 
about 6 o'clock or 6.30. I guess it was around 6.30

18:08.897 --> 18:17.230
because we were lined up at 7 and the mess hall about 
7.30 if I remember and maybe 6 o'clock, 6.30, 7.

18:20.835 --> 18:22.157
Well, we were in full classes. It was 8 o'clock 
every morning. And we walked everywhere we went. A

18:27.202 --> 18:39.576
few people had bicycles, but as you looked at the 
A&M campus, it was just students walking

18:27.202 --> 18:39.576
everywhere with hooks under their arms and a sling 
over their shoulder. All right, then before

18:39.857 --> 18:43.100
lunch, did you fall in again? We fell in again 
before lunch. And the same here at night and in the

18:46.690 --> 18:50.595
evening. Usually the evening performance was a 
little more special than the one at noon. And

18:56.702 --> 19:03.630
sometimes at noon, we had formation three times a 
day. All right, after supper, what was the typical

19:03.650 --> 19:11.119
routine on a weeknight? Did you go back to your 
room? Did you go play somewhere? We had a little

19:16.103 --> 19:30.440
camaraderie usually over our meal in the evening, 
and usually we'd get out with a few of our buddies

19:16.103 --> 19:30.440
and walk around the lounge under the shade of a tree 
and bowl a little bit. But we all had studies, and I

19:30.480 --> 19:41.013
had to get up early the next morning, so it was a 
routine for me to pretty well head back to my room

19:30.480 --> 19:41.013
and go to work. All right. Describe the routine in 
Sabisa Hall at mealtime for a freshman. Where did

19:49.195 --> 19:51.842
you sit and what did you all do during the meal? 
Well, the best I can remember Of course, so many of

19:54.578 --> 19:57.703
us, they didn't shave my head. My head was short, 
necessarily, anyway. Very little shaving back in

19:59.667 --> 20:02.051
those days. But we sat, it was, on the property, we 
sat extremely correct. And we had, of course,

20:08.723 --> 20:14.253
certain rules we had to follow. And the officers 
and A couple of freshmen were fed, always served by

20:19.975 --> 20:24.084
the freshmen first. And we got what was left, but it 
was always plenty. And if we

20:28.253 --> 20:34.407
particularly Fond of dessert, we would usually 
stick an extra piece of pie, a sweet roll or

20:35.095 --> 20:45.265
something under our shirt and carry it out 
frequently. Did the food have nicknames in those

20:46.606 --> 20:49.268
days? Oh, yes. Please share some of those 
nicknames. Well, dessert was kush always, and I

20:52.532 --> 21:01.700
recall meat was

20:52.532 --> 21:01.700
bull. Bull neck? Well,

21:04.525 --> 21:13.158
they had a nickname for practically every one of 
them, most of the vegetables. And meat, bull neck,

21:14.100 --> 21:17.766
bull neck for meat. Bread,

21:18.447 --> 21:26.059
ketchup, tea. For everything they had some sort of 
nickname. I don't remember all the details. uh

21:33.078 --> 22:00.857
let's see uh was your freshman roommate did he 
become a special friend i had three roommates

21:33.078 --> 22:00.857
unfortunately unfortunately my first one was 
paul moore paul moore was a great young man from

21:33.078 --> 22:00.857
beeville taking veterinary science and paul 
moore It was difficult for him to concentrate and

22:01.917 --> 22:11.687
he had trouble and he had to drop out at the end of his 
first semester.

22:15.351 --> 22:26.362
But Paul went ahead and did graduate from a vet 
school and became the number two veterinarian at

22:15.351 --> 22:26.362
King Ranch. He worked for Dr. Northrup and got some 
valuable training. And just a wonderful man with a

22:31.786 --> 22:40.797
lot of personality, but he had one weakness, and 
that was barley corn. And as so many people at the

22:40.897 --> 22:49.868
King Ranch did, he drank too much and it affected 
his life. And the other one following him was

22:49.888 --> 23:00.240
Cliff Hardwick. how do we get a gin people out of 
Sherman? And he was a sort of a privileged young man

23:04.507 --> 23:20.101
because his father was a manufacturer and rather 
wealthy, I think, because he was one of the few that

23:04.507 --> 23:20.101
had money and had an automobile off campus. But 
Cliff was a good friend, but we just didn't have the

23:20.441 --> 23:29.569
right chemistry. and he

23:30.376 --> 23:41.410
went to room with someone else the following 
semester. He was killed, incidentally, in one of

23:41.891 --> 23:49.641
the first horse cavalry episodes in the 
Philippines. The machine gun was killed there

23:49.841 --> 23:53.285
early. But Cliff was always a good friend. And then 
I had... Ralph McCambell, a rancher from

24:00.211 --> 24:02.995
Hebronville. He was a sophomore while I was a 
junior.

24:09.665 --> 24:18.277
Yeah, when I was a sophomore, he was a freshman, 
came as a freshman, but I wanted him because he was a

24:09.665 --> 24:18.277
Corpus Christi. Your outfit was very special to 
you as you look back on it, your core outfit. What

24:26.108 --> 24:29.593
made it special? leadership and the friends that I 
made there and the camaraderie and

24:30.670 --> 24:42.145
the pride in their unit. And a troop was always a 
special troop and a cavalry of the elite service as

24:42.165 --> 24:52.078
far as we were concerned. And I think it's pretty 
well recognized at that time back in those days

24:52.098 --> 24:57.305
that the cavalry won. Did you all have a nickname 
for the outfit? No, it just stayed true. How did you

25:04.637 --> 25:08.241
describe your dress when you went to class? What 
did you wear to class? Well, the government issued

25:10.504 --> 25:29.027
you your Army uniform, and that was part of being in 
the military and taking the military, and we wore a

25:10.504 --> 25:29.027
uniform religiously. Please describe some of the 
pranks or the jokes or the good bull that you were

25:30.914 --> 25:40.872
aware of that occurred while you were a student.

25:44.117 --> 25:54.255
Well, there again, I worked so hard, I say worked so 
hard, I had such a regimen that was so full I was

25:55.214 --> 26:03.727
interested in acrobatics and had an opportunity 
through Penny to work with the tumbling team. And

26:04.789 --> 26:11.899
then I was in the cavalry and very quickly got 
involved in polo and in monkey drill squad. And

26:12.701 --> 26:15.725
that's something a lot of people never heard of. 
But the monkey drill squad was an acrobatic and

26:16.426 --> 26:21.254
trick riding group. And we had an old army sergeant 
who was an artist at this type of thing, and he

26:24.509 --> 26:30.895
trained us. Tell them about that. I've not heard 
about the Monkey Drill Squad before. Well, I've

26:34.098 --> 26:36.641
got some pictures of it, I'm sure to you. We had a...

26:38.342 --> 26:52.356
With his help and Captain Robertson, we had two 
outstanding cavalry officers. Major Ross Irvin

26:53.602 --> 26:58.990
and Captain Marcella Roberts. And they were both 
unusually well qualified

27:00.692 --> 27:23.305
men with lots of interest and humor

27:00.692 --> 27:23.305
and made the cavalry work we did interesting. And 
of course

27:23.656 --> 27:32.063
we did the hoodoos and we camped. trained to shoot 
.50 caliber machine guns. We fired pistol mounted

27:37.357 --> 27:39.859
and dismounted. We were expert at sharpshooter 
and we were always into things that were active and

27:41.561 --> 27:53.314
fun. Where did, where were the cavalry horses 
stabled? They had a special stable area there like

28:02.823 --> 28:04.204
West of the tracks? Oh yes, west of the tracks, 
there was. How many horses have... Well, I think

28:07.087 --> 28:29.269
there must have been 40, 50 horses, or better, 
maybe 60, 70, that we had of that group where the

28:07.087 --> 28:29.269
sergeant, I wish I could name his name, was 
bald-headed, red-faced, short, stout, tough as a

28:30.008 --> 28:59.458
bull and he knew those horses and he picked the best 
ones for our monkey trail squad because we would

28:30.008 --> 28:59.458
ride them bareback with a surcingle and you'd 
stand on the horse and ride in a circle in a corral

28:30.008 --> 28:59.458
you might say and then we'd ride two abreast and 
three abreast and we'd build pyramids and then we

28:30.008 --> 28:59.458
would through the use of the search angle, you'd 
vault from one side of the horse to the other as you

28:59.793 --> 29:07.829
galloped. And you would learn to let the momentum 
of the horse as it swung forward to bring you back up

29:07.849 --> 29:16.246
in standing position. And it had a lot of romance to 
it and a lot of fun. Where did you all perform? Well,

29:22.220 --> 29:28.769
we performed like the polo team, you know, at 
different times it was announced. And mainly it

29:28.889 --> 29:39.763
was an activity that didn't get much publicity, 
but it was done because we all enjoyed it so much.

29:41.205 --> 29:44.329
Kind of like an NMU sport, didn't get a whole lot of 
publicity. How different was it in that time to be a

29:45.271 --> 29:52.625
sophomore in the Corps of Cadets than to be a 
freshman? Describe being a sophomore for me.

29:55.069 --> 30:02.283
Well, as a sophomore, I never was hazed myself, you 
know. As I say, I paddled a few times pretty hard.

30:08.137 --> 30:09.680
But if I did, I deserved it. And I knew I deserved it. 
And I knew whatever infraction I did, that I'd

30:12.023 --> 30:18.695
probably get a good filing from one of them. But it 
was administered in a manly way and in a fair way.

30:24.304 --> 30:28.771
And, you know, it was never an abusive thing. And 
the sophomores,

30:29.352 --> 30:34.701
of course, we We had these various different 
traditional things that they did. But I didn't

30:47.026 --> 30:52.617
take part in most of them because of my work or the 
work that I had to do. And they respected that. Any

30:55.673 --> 31:08.566
of us that had jobs like I had in the janitor corps 
that was demanding and got you up real early, they

30:55.673 --> 31:08.566
made special dispensation for that. An important 
question. Please describe some of the important

31:11.048 --> 31:18.115
teachers and advisors that affected your life 
there. Well, I was always tried to be I was

31:26.875 --> 31:37.729
interested in my subjects and the toughest thing 
was my chemistry.
