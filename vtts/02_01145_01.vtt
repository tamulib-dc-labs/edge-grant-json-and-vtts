00:01.533 --> 00:09.802
Okay, this is Ron Shorn interviewing Torrance 
Johnson in Boulder, Colorado on October 20th,

00:01.533 --> 00:09.802
1993. Torrance, for the record, could you give us 
your full name? Torrance V. Johnson. And when and

00:19.313 --> 00:21.835
where were you born? In New York, December 1st, 
1944. New York City? Actually on Long Island,

00:26.180 --> 00:27.902
Rockville Center. When did you first get 
interested in astronomy? Oh, I was interested in

00:31.756 --> 00:35.360
astronomy as a kid. Actually, I was more 
interested in dinosaurs. But as I got interested

00:37.323 --> 00:46.614
in physics and things like that, I got interested 
in telescopes and astronomy along with that. I

00:47.195 --> 00:54.704
used to go to the planetarium in both New York when 
we lived there, and we also lived out in San

00:47.195 --> 00:54.704
Francisco. And folks used to take me to the 
planetarium every year. every month for new

00:58.807 --> 01:00.388
shows. So I've been interested pretty much since I 
was a small kid.

01:06.734 --> 01:09.157
Where did you go to undergraduate school? 
Washington University in St. Louis. And what was

01:11.239 --> 01:12.580
your major? Physics with a pretty strong minor in 
geology and geophysics. Why did you pick that

01:16.884 --> 01:18.285
university? It's halfway between Long Island and 
San Francisco, of course. Well, we moved around

01:22.849 --> 01:24.211
when I was a kid. My father was in the Coast Guard, 
and About the time I was in high school, he retired

01:27.123 --> 01:36.499
from the Coast Guard and went back to school at 
Mississippi Southern University, which was,

01:27.123 --> 01:36.499
Mississippi was where my mother came from. And 
when time came around to get to college, we were

01:36.539 --> 01:45.214
looking for good scholarships and things, and I'd 
never been to the Midwest before. Washington U had

01:45.394 --> 01:47.578
a very strong program. going out aggressively 
recruiting smart people from different parts of

01:47.913 --> 01:52.581
the country. We were the first class that had more 
than 50% streetcar college kids from the local

01:52.601 --> 02:01.576
parts of St. Louis. Did you take any astronomy as an 
undergraduate? No, there wasn't an astronomy

02:06.205 --> 02:10.454
department at Washington U. What we had was some 
physicists who were engaged in different types of

02:10.955 --> 02:17.448
what is generally called astronomy. We had people 
interested in X-ray, gamma ray, and the emerging

02:17.468 --> 02:23.100
field of infrared astronomy at that time. In fact, 
my interest in that type of astronomy was piqued by

02:23.080 --> 02:30.710
doing a senior project for Dr. Friedman there. And 
what I did was researched a lot of the early work in

02:31.291 --> 02:48.613
infrared astronomy being done out at Caltech by 
Gary Neugebauer and Bruce Murray, and tried to

02:31.291 --> 02:48.613
help think about how they might set up some similar 
infrared work at Washington U. When did you get

02:50.475 --> 02:51.737
your bachelor's degree? 1966. And then where did 
you go for your graduate work? I went out to Caltech

02:56.635 --> 03:04.563
and I was influenced partially by those working 
and reading with those papers on infrared

02:56.635 --> 03:04.563
astronomy. I thought it was sort of neat to couple 
the ideas of astronomy and geology together and I

03:04.583 --> 03:16.735
was interested in the infrared telescopic work 
that was being done out at Caltech. And right at

03:17.496 --> 03:19.378
that time I sent my my application into the physics 
department, since I was in the physics

03:19.645 --> 03:22.972
department. And I wasn't really good enough in 
physics to get into the Caltech physics

03:23.292 --> 03:40.928
department, but they bumped it over to geology, 
where Bruce was trying to put together a program of

03:23.292 --> 03:40.928
people working quantitatively with using 
astronomy and physics to understand planetary

03:23.292 --> 03:40.928
problems. What did you do your doctoral 
dissertation on, and who under? I was a student of

03:45.441 --> 03:55.210
Bruce Murray's at Caltech from the time I got 
there, and I worked on doing spectrophotometric

03:45.441 --> 03:55.210
studies of the Galilean satellites. Bruce was 
quite good at, I think, handing over really good

03:56.331 --> 04:03.157
problems to his students. I had a survey course 
from Bruce where he kind of laid out a lot of things

04:03.818 --> 04:09.683
about solar system astronomy to us, And he said, 
gee, nothing's known about the Galilean

04:10.085 --> 04:13.551
satellites of Jupiter. Why don't you work on that? 
And what he had done was asked me to review for the

04:15.434 --> 04:22.366
class everything that was known about the 
Galilean satellites. I accomplished that in

04:22.446 --> 04:25.572
about 15 minutes at the time. Now we can have a whole 
conference on one aspect of Io for a week. And the

04:32.883 --> 04:42.693
other thing that came together at that time was 
that Tom McCord was in the midst of his thesis work

04:32.883 --> 04:42.693
there also working for Bruce Murray. And he had 
developed and built his dual beam photometer for

04:43.534 --> 04:54.766
doing multispectral observations at anywhere 
from 12 to 24 different wavelengths of different

04:43.534 --> 04:54.766
areas on the moon. And Bruce thought it would be a 
neat idea to apply that instrumentation to the

04:59.360 --> 05:01.282
Galilean satellite studies. So I started working 
with Tom, helping him with his lunar studies, and I

05:01.302 --> 05:06.909
got involved in lunar astronomy at that point 
also. And then as Tom phased out of that, went to

05:07.630 --> 05:22.649
MIT, I took over the equipment, if you will, and 
started working on that for a whole apparition

05:07.630 --> 05:22.649
doing spectrophotometric studies of the 
Galilean satellites. When did you complete your

05:24.071 --> 05:26.734
PhD, or when did they throw you out? I left for MIT in 
1969 to take up a post-doctoral job with Tom

05:27.119 --> 05:36.000
McCord, who'd set up a lab there. And so I 
concentrated on getting my thesis published,

05:36.882 --> 05:44.200
which I actually got a little bit of it published as 
opposed to some people. and continuing to expand

05:44.855 --> 05:55.600
the work that Tom and I had started on both the moon, 
satellites, and asteroids with his group that Tom

05:44.855 --> 05:55.600
had started at MIT. So I arrived there in the fall of 
69. How did you make that connection with

05:59.208 --> 06:01.513
McCartan? Well, as I said, I've been working with 
him. He was, in essence, my mentor amongst the

06:05.919 --> 06:13.568
graduate students at Caltech. He was a couple of 
years ahead of me, and I kind of apprenticed myself

06:13.648 --> 06:22.359
to him to learn about the equipment side of the 
business, working with lunar observations. And

06:23.080 --> 06:29.728
then when he went to MIT, I spent another year 
finishing up my thesis, and he offered me a

06:23.080 --> 06:29.728
postdoctoral position at MIT. OK, how long did you 
keep this postdoc, and what did you do? Well, what

06:34.612 --> 06:40.097
we worked on during that period of time, the period 
was 1969 until about 1971. So it was a little over a

06:40.158 --> 06:46.144
year and a half at MIT. And during that period, we 
worked on a number of interesting things,

06:46.164 --> 06:58.737
extending the spectrophotometric studies we've 
been doing to Saturn satellites. and the rings of

06:59.172 --> 07:01.995
Saturn, and to asteroids. And there were a lot of 
people that are major players in that game that

07:02.856 --> 07:09.404
were students of Tom's and that I worked with. 
Clark Chapman was doing asteroid

07:09.704 --> 07:14.129
spectrophotometry. And let's see, I was trying to 
think. Gloria Lubofsky was doing a lot of stuff on

07:18.154 --> 07:22.058
the rings of Saturn at that time. And I got involved 
with both of those partially kind of helping bring

07:25.700 --> 07:31.786
them along with using the equipment and data 
reduction and so forth in the same way that Tom had

07:25.700 --> 07:31.786
helped me. What did you do after that post-doc? 
Well, times were tough then. If you remember, in

07:38.532 --> 07:48.201
1970, 71, we were hitting the big post-Apollo 
downswing, and academic positions were as scarce

07:38.532 --> 07:48.201
as hen's teeth. And so I started looking around, 
getting my resume out. I actually looked at taking

07:52.305 --> 07:54.947
a job with... what became the, you know, there was 
an environmental office that was set up back then.

08:01.289 --> 08:02.713
I've even forgotten what they called it. I went 
down to Washington to interview with those guys.

08:06.102 --> 08:12.177
And I went out to, I wrote to JPL for one of these NRC, 
National Research Council, postdoctoral

08:13.135 --> 08:26.155
positions, which were postdoctoral but paid a lot 
better than the academic postdoc positions at

08:13.135 --> 08:26.155
that time. So ultimately I ended up doing a NRC 
postdoc at JPL and getting involved in some

08:26.175 --> 08:37.732
research at JPL that then led to getting a job offer 
at JPL when that ran out. What did you do with that

08:37.952 --> 08:41.338
NRC thing? How long was it and what did you do? I 
think that was a period of two years. I'd have to

08:45.467 --> 08:46.128
check. Let's see. I just got my 20th year pin at JPL. 
So I was, I guess, officially hired in around

08:50.775 --> 08:54.280
December of 93. So it was a two year. 73. I'm sorry. 
So I must have been hired in December of 73. And so it

09:01.631 --> 09:06.278
was a two year postdoctoral thing. And during that 
period of time, we started doing, I worked a bit

09:06.747 --> 09:13.118
with Dennis Madsen on infrared studies of 
asteroids. And one of the major studies that we

09:14.040 --> 09:20.972
started at that point was doing a little bit of 
laboratory work, which I hadn't done before.

09:21.012 --> 09:22.815
Frasier Finale was at JPL. And he and I started 
doing some of the first spectral observations of

09:23.420 --> 09:40.534
meteorite samples to see if we could explain the 
properties of these very dark, spectrally

09:23.420 --> 09:40.534
featureless asteroids that we were beginning to 
come up with from Chapman's spectrophotometric

09:23.420 --> 09:40.534
survey. Now, you've been at JPL since then until 
today, and just in general, what have you been

09:41.324 --> 09:50.880
doing the last 20 years? Well, let's see. I guess 
during my general tenure at JPL, things have kind

09:52.302 --> 10:00.536
of split into two general areas. One of them is 
continuation of telescopic research, and the

10:04.342 --> 10:14.032
other is spacecraft

10:04.342 --> 10:14.032
instrumentation and experiments in about equal 
measure.

10:18.096 --> 10:30.788
Over the years at JPL, we've continued to work on 
spectral imaging techniques on everything from

10:18.096 --> 10:30.788
lunar things to spacecraft images from Voyager 
and Galileo.

10:31.190 --> 10:39.600
In the last decade or so, we've gotten quite 
involved in infrared astronomy of Jupiter's

10:31.190 --> 10:39.600
satellite Io. After we discovered the volcanoes 
on Io with Voyager, we realized that we probably

10:40.001 --> 11:01.146
had all along been seeing the infrared signature 
of those volcanoes in the ground-based infrared

10:40.001 --> 11:01.146
data on Io and set up a program to monitor and 
measure the heat energy coming from Io. So I worked

11:01.126 --> 11:20.628
on the Voyager imaging team through all of its 
encounters with Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and

11:01.126 --> 11:20.628
Neptune, and I got involved in the mid-'70s with a 
lot of NASA studies on future missions,

11:01.126 --> 11:20.628
particularly to the Jupiter system, as a result of 
the work that I'd done. Don Hunton had a committee

11:20.688 --> 11:29.158
on atmospheric entry probes that I was a member of, 
and then I was a member of... Jim Van Allen's

11:29.138 --> 11:36.225
committee, which ultimately recommended the 
Jupiter Orbiter Probe Mission, which became the

11:29.138 --> 11:36.225
Galileo Mission. And after that got started, I 
became the project scientist on that, which has

11:36.986 --> 11:45.835
sort of occupied me since 1978, about half of my 
time, more or less. Okay, now I'm going to switch

11:46.775 --> 11:48.137
the subject. Do you consider planetary 
astronomy, or planetary science, I realize that

11:49.218 --> 11:58.487
some people make a difference, but I'll call it 
planetary astronomy...

11:59.581 --> 12:03.245
Is it part of astronomy, in your opinion? Some of it 
is parts of astronomy. I think it is almost

12:05.107 --> 12:22.287
becoming a separate discipline in itself in the 
sense of the study of planets involving a lot of the

12:05.107 --> 12:22.287
major physical and even biological sciences 
directed toward studies in the planetary

12:05.107 --> 12:22.287
context. When you started in this game in the 60s, 
and early 70s, did you feel second rate compared

12:29.737 --> 12:39.551
to, quote, real, unquote, astronomers like the 
ones at Caltech and Palomar models? We had a lot of

12:40.753 --> 12:43.517
that type of feeling. At Caltech, it was a little 
bit more like the traditional

12:43.597 --> 12:59.119
frictions between the messier sciences like 
chemistry and geology compared to the purer

12:43.597 --> 12:59.119
sciences like astronomy, mathematics, and 
physics. And I think those of us that worked for

12:59.791 --> 13:10.812
Bruce, we didn't feel second rate, but we knew that 
a lot of the real astronomers felt that we were

12:59.791 --> 13:10.812
second rate. I think we felt a bit more like 
Mavericks. We knew we were good. We knew we were

13:15.662 --> 13:21.613
applying techniques that had never been applied 
to interesting problems before. It was kind of

13:21.813 --> 13:22.554
interesting. You'd run into people on the 
mountain. You're doing something, and they'd

13:24.376 --> 13:27.339
say, what, you're doing that on a planet? And you'd 
describe your equipment to them, and by God, your

13:27.459 --> 13:34.307
equipment and the techniques you were using would 
be better than what they were using. So it was a fair

13:35.909 --> 13:38.172
amount of cross-fertilization. Mostly, I'd say 
the rivalry was more friendly than not. You

13:43.077 --> 13:43.838
think... Do you think today that planetary 
astronomy and planetary astronomers are

13:44.105 --> 13:52.427
accepted by other astronomers or do you think 
they're still considered a little second rate

13:44.105 --> 13:52.427
because they're not megaparsecs away? I think 
there's always, I think they're more accepted. I

13:57.901 --> 14:01.325
think there's a lot less of why are you looking at a 
planet? Why are you even worried about it? We used

14:03.108 --> 14:04.289
to get those questions. Some of that was just 
ignorance and compartmentalization amongst the

14:05.831 --> 14:11.358
pure astronomers. I think there was a lot of 
feeling that with the discovery of Pluto and a few

14:11.818 --> 14:20.549
of these other things that it was sort of like the 
field had been put to bed. We knew about the

14:20.569 --> 14:21.490
planets. They were close and so forth. And I think 
that feeling went away gradually and probably not

14:23.153 --> 14:37.450
gone completely at the moment with the 
discoveries that were made by the spacecraft and

14:23.153 --> 14:37.450
ground-based astronomy in the last 20 years, 
revitalizing a field. It's a bit like celestial

14:37.490 --> 14:38.912
mechanics. I mean, I always felt celestial 
mechanics was a dead field until people like Peter

14:38.972 --> 14:46.181
Golreich started playing games, and now chaos is 
big in it. I mean, it's bigger than it was when

14:46.221 --> 14:51.507
Descartes and those guys were working on things. 
There actually is some stuff that Laplace or

14:52.010 --> 14:55.717
Lagrange didn't discover.

14:58.583 --> 15:08.802
Could you take a minute or two and just give me your 
subjective opinion of how planetary astronomy

14:58.583 --> 15:08.802
has changed from when you began in it to now? 
Obvious things like size, for example. Well,

15:11.267 --> 15:12.229
there are Size is the thing that comes to mind, 
particularly sitting here at the DPS meeting, is

15:12.749 --> 15:20.422
that there's just a massive amount more people 
working in the field. And I think this mimics the

15:20.462 --> 15:33.745
growth of astronomy out of phase by maybe a few 
decades also, is that when the DPS started and when

15:20.462 --> 15:33.745
I began in the field, you could... literally fit 
most of the planetary astronomy and planetary

15:33.961 --> 15:43.735
geologists, if you wanted to, you know, around the 
table in a relatively large room. And now the hotel

15:44.153 --> 15:50.762
is overflowing with people all working in the 
area. That's been one of the changes. I think the

15:52.344 --> 15:59.935
other change is the diversity of techniques being 
applied these days, all the way from X-ray to

15:52.344 --> 15:59.935
X-band, if you will. A lot of things that were just 
dreams that we had, and considering things that we

16:00.816 --> 16:06.904
might apply to planetary studies, in the 60s are 
absolutely routine now. Super high-resolution

16:10.929 --> 16:14.513
spectroscopy, infrared imaging. Spacecraft are 
the obvious things. Spacecraft make big

16:18.057 --> 16:23.163
breakthrough sets of observations. There's no 
other way to make. But even amongst the techniques

16:24.585 --> 16:35.878
used in near-Earth space and ground-based, I 
think that I'm kind of overwhelmed by the number of

16:24.585 --> 16:35.878
different clever ideas theoretically and 
experimentally that people were applying to the

16:36.247 --> 16:40.955
problem these days. Do you ever get annoyed when 
some popular level book claims that space probes

16:41.977 --> 16:50.270
discovered everything we know about the solar 
system? I tell you, we fought that with the press on

16:51.092 --> 16:59.886
Voyager so hard and with so little success. It was 
extremely frustrating because Most of the people

17:02.403 --> 17:17.403
on the science teams on Voyager were well aware 
that they were standing on the shoulders of a

17:02.403 --> 17:17.403
generation or two of people looking and studying 
these things from the ground and the theoretical

17:02.403 --> 17:17.403
underpinnings. Perhaps the most egregious 
example of that is the business of water ice in the

17:17.724 --> 17:25.474
outer solar system, which was... hinted at very 
strongly in work back in the 50s done by Kuiper and

17:25.758 --> 17:47.563
others, a simple one and two broadband IR 
observation showing that the reflectance of the

17:25.758 --> 17:47.563
satellites was very low and hints that the albedos 
of the satellites were very high, although the

17:25.758 --> 17:47.563
issue of the albedos, of course, was 
controversial because we didn't have good radii.

17:47.948 --> 17:56.178
But, you know, by the early 70s, the ground-based 
spectra were incontrovertible. Water ice

17:56.218 --> 17:59.703
existed in the outer solar system on most of these 
surfaces. We began to get a few good radii. The

18:02.026 --> 18:03.167
albedos were high. This was established context 
by the time Voyager visited the Galilean

18:03.688 --> 18:16.204
satellites in 79, and yet to this day you still see 
after Voyager got there, we then knew that there

18:03.688 --> 18:16.204
was water ice on the surface of these things. And 
Everybody who talked with the press from the

18:18.307 --> 18:23.633
science community always kept making that point. 
But it's a cultural thing, and you're probably

18:24.193 --> 18:29.199
aware of this in the work that you've done. Well, 
hi, Spinrad. And Toby and I get a big bang out of

18:30.020 --> 18:35.686
Viking discovered, or whatever, Mariner 
discovered water on Mars. But the best one was when

18:36.267 --> 18:44.115
Viking 1 lander landed, there was a headline in a 
Houston paper, one of the Houston papers. It said,

18:44.336 --> 18:46.558
Viking proves Mars is red. And Andy Young was so mad 
that he wrote off a letter. He says, well, why

18:52.025 --> 18:56.551
didn't they say Viking proves grass is green or 
something like that? I'm surprised at that from

18:56.752 --> 18:59.555
Andy, what he should have said. Viking didn't 
prove Mars was red, and it isn't anyway.

19:06.084 --> 19:08.327
What's the best piece of work you've done, in your 
opinion? Oh, Lord, that's I've worked on a number

19:10.096 --> 19:14.620
of things. I think in terms of sort of team science, 
I'm proudest of having worked to get what I think

19:14.701 --> 19:38.203
are much better observations of the satellites 
throughout the history of the Voyager mission

19:14.701 --> 19:38.203
than would have been done if we hadn't had myself 
and a lot of other good people working very hard to

19:14.701 --> 19:38.203
get good satellite observations. These things 
are quite difficult to plan in detail and take a lot

19:40.066 --> 19:45.092
of hard work. In terms of specific scientific type 
things, I feel myself quite attached to Io and the

19:45.893 --> 19:58.429
way Carl maybe feels himself attached to Mars. And 
I think that my efforts over the years have done a

20:00.311 --> 20:09.803
lot toward illuminating what's really going on on 
Io, although nobody would pretend to really

20:10.137 --> 20:11.018
understand it now. The work I've done with Dennis 
Mattson trying to understand the heat flow from

20:11.058 --> 20:17.268
Iowa I think is perhaps some of the most 
fundamental work on that. Where do you get your

20:19.171 --> 20:20.893
ideas on what to do? Is it because NASA puts out a 
request for proposals to study EO or is it because

20:20.933 --> 20:30.748
you have an idea that you think you want to do? In 
your personal experience, what's the mix there?

20:34.707 --> 20:44.639
My personal experience is that it's almost 
entirely internally driven, but that's because

20:34.707 --> 20:44.639
the environment, at least up until the current 
moment, has allowed that. In other words, we've

20:45.340 --> 20:59.837
been fortunate to be in a situation where we can 
come up with interesting concepts in planetary

20:45.340 --> 20:59.837
science, and there is, in fact, the structure of 
interest at NASA and other funding agencies to

20:45.340 --> 20:59.837
pursue that. we haven't had to go out and look to 
find exactly what they're interested in in order

21:00.104 --> 21:07.212
to get the funding. And that started as my tenure at 
Caltech was

21:07.532 --> 21:16.202
supported. You're talking about the meteorites. 
Reminded me of the...

21:23.290 --> 21:25.032
Reminded me of the... The first asteroid that we 
got a really good spectrum of that had a really good

21:25.467 --> 21:31.896
absorption band in it was Vesta. And it's still the 
most pronounced absorption band on any asteroid

21:32.817 --> 21:36.983
that was observed. And I think it probably holds 
the record for the fastest identification of any

21:37.423 --> 21:46.215
planetary piece of remote spectral sensing. And 
the reason is it happened right after the first

21:46.336 --> 21:51.002
Apollo sample returns. And the data from the Vesta 
run, which I'd been involved in, Lebowski, MJ

21:51.674 --> 22:03.917
Elias, and a few other people, along with Tom 
McCord, was wrapped up on tape and waiting,

21:51.674 --> 22:03.917
sitting at MITPAL at MIT, the Planetary Astronomy 
Lab. And Tom was off working with their initial

22:04.939 --> 22:14.678
sample returns with John Adams, taking spectra, 
the return samples, comparing it with lunar

22:04.939 --> 22:14.678
samples. And we had in hand right at that time, we 
talked to some of my older colleagues who dealt

22:15.130 --> 22:27.408
with headquarters and the government in the 
pre-Apollo era, in the Apollo era. I think you'll

22:27.968 --> 22:31.814
find a slightly different tinge, at least 
anecdotally. People felt that a lot of the people

22:31.854 --> 22:38.444
at NASA were not well-trained in their fields and 
didn't know what good science were. By the time I

22:39.285 --> 22:42.910
was interacting with them, partially as a result 
of criticisms like that from the Academy and other

22:43.160 --> 23:00.038
places, the people at headquarters who actually 
were involved in directing the programs

22:43.160 --> 23:00.038
connected with planetary work I feel were in fact, 
well equipped to discern what was good and were

23:00.220 --> 23:10.555
working very hard to develop peer review 
techniques and so forth. That doesn't mean

23:10.575 --> 23:26.498
everything went swimmingly, but I didn't run into 
the types of things that I at least heard stories

23:10.575 --> 23:26.498
about, like somebody in there had been trained as 
an agronomist or something like that who was

23:10.575 --> 23:26.498
suddenly trying to make a whole bunch of decisions 
about what instruments should go on some Mars

23:10.575 --> 23:26.498
mission. There have been three big funding 
crunches in NASA's history. One was the one you

23:33.641 --> 23:36.204
referred to earlier, 1973 or so. There was another 
one around 81 or 82, and it looks like we're going to

23:36.364 --> 23:44.015
get another one right now. What effect does this 
have on the field, and in particular on the younger

23:44.856 --> 23:51.085
guys who don't have a reputation yet? Well, the 
80-81 crunch was basically, I believe,

23:52.347 --> 24:02.581
coincident with the Nixon administration and the 
Reagan administration coming in. And some of the

24:02.601 --> 24:14.137
feeling on the part of some of the parts of that 
administration that NASA was either irrelevant

24:02.601 --> 24:14.137
or science was. I'm not sure which. which 
gradually worked its way out, but the emphasis on

24:17.204 --> 24:21.590
the shuttle was very strong then. The shuttle was 
having problems. I was not personally affected

24:23.353 --> 24:31.604
too badly by that in my professional career in the 
sense that we had to worry about not getting

24:23.353 --> 24:31.604
funded. We were in the midst of trying to get 
Galileo built at that time. The way we were

24:35.249 --> 24:42.259
affected was that it had a tremendously negative 
effect on the long-term stretch out of the Galileo

24:35.249 --> 24:42.259
program. The shuttle should have been flying in 
the early 80s, and it wasn't. And that affected

24:46.685 --> 24:54.084
Galileo and all subsequent planetary and space 
missions. So the 80s were a continual struggle, if

24:54.104 --> 24:59.378
you will, to play catch up from that. And given that 
those stretch outs cost large amounts of money,

24:59.746 --> 25:10.237
the money available for research outside of the 
mission areas also decreased during that period

24:59.746 --> 25:10.237
of time. And that's where you first started 
feeling that there was a tremendous pressure on

25:11.338 --> 25:17.364
some of the younger people in the field. It became 
very difficult then and has remained difficult to

25:18.405 --> 25:22.629
get permanent positions. A lot of people have been 
in rotating post-doctoral positions and

25:23.370 --> 25:29.196
unsolved money positions even when they do get a 
job. uh it's been said that every year the dps got

25:29.480 --> 25:57.580
lots of young eager faces at it but um somebody else 
also remarked that well they're not all the same

25:29.480 --> 25:57.580
eager faces and they're all looking for a job and uh 
that that's been kind of a pattern since that

25:29.480 --> 25:57.580
period in the early 80s in my my impression uh if a 
sharp person who just got their bachelor's degree

25:29.480 --> 25:57.580
came up to you and said gee i really want to be a 
planetary astronomer what would you say to him or

25:29.480 --> 25:57.580
her I guess my first-order response would be a 
relatively elitist one. There's always room at

26:03.036 --> 26:04.758
the top. If that's what you're really interested 
in and you're good, you can find a place. That

26:11.669 --> 26:14.894
doesn't mean it's the best place to make a career, 
best place to make money. There might be something

26:15.175 --> 26:17.579
the person is equally interested in. Well, of 
course, it's a similar situation to the one that

26:17.599 --> 26:23.207
astronomers in general went for 100 years. There 
were very few jobs in astronomy, and of course,

26:26.534 --> 26:33.561
about the money crunch before there was the 
shuttle, Apollo was the villain, and now it's the

26:26.534 --> 26:33.561
space station, and there's always something. So 
that part at least is constant. If you listen to the

26:35.743 --> 26:51.017
tenor of the discussions at NASA night here at the 
DPS, I don't see any, the names have changed and

26:35.743 --> 26:51.017
some of the issues have changed, but the general 
tenor of the discussions sound an awful lot like

26:35.743 --> 26:51.017
the ones I heard back in the 70s. Where do you think 
planetary astronomy today would be without

26:52.338 --> 26:56.322
NASA's money? the stuff it's given over the last 30 
years or so. Well, I think that goes back to your

27:00.385 --> 27:09.073
point about the way planetary astronomy was 
viewed in the previous decades. I think it would be

27:09.894 --> 27:28.772
a relatively small offshoot of, if you quote Will, 
regular astronomy, dealing with global

27:09.894 --> 27:28.772
properties of objects and occasional 
curiosities, such as Io or the rotation of

27:09.894 --> 27:28.772
Mercury. I think the infusion of support for 
studying the solar system that started with the

27:28.752 --> 27:44.785
Apollo program and NASA and, well, the space 
program generally. I mean, starting with

27:44.805 --> 27:48.212
Sputnik, really, if you want to put it that way. By 
the way, my high school career was altered

27:48.192 --> 27:54.638
somewhat by what was an old Title IV funds 
post-Sputnik. You know, we got to get, you know,

27:54.678 --> 27:57.341
better scientists. We got good equipment, and I 
got more interested in physics as a result of that

27:57.401 --> 28:01.205
type of thing. But I don't think there would be a 
field of planetary astronomy or planetary

28:03.207 --> 28:13.677
science as we know it today other than without 
NASA's infusion of resources. There would

28:13.657 --> 28:25.471
probably be a single faculty member or maybe two 
faculty members in a couple of the larger

28:13.657 --> 28:25.471
departments dealing with this, more or less as it 
was back in the 50s and 40s. Today, the Division for

28:27.574 --> 28:34.802
Planetary Sciences of the American Astronomical 
Society exists, and it has an official journal,

28:27.574 --> 28:34.802
namely Icarus. Are these two developments good, 
bad, inevitable? What's your feelings? I think

28:43.087 --> 29:00.117
you've got to put it in the context of what was 
happening generally in the 60s and 70s as they

28:43.087 --> 29:00.117
developed this entire field of planetary 
studies, and I won't restrict it strictly to

28:43.087 --> 29:00.117
planetary astronomy. There was a feeling in a 
number of the classical professional societies

29:00.670 --> 29:09.498
that they needed to take account of this 
discipline in some way. And this was done in a

29:10.119 --> 29:12.160
number of different ways. In the astronomy 
community, the Division for Planetary Science

29:12.521 --> 29:17.065
was formed. Some of the same players were 
responsible for forming a section in the American

29:17.325 --> 29:22.009
Geophysical Union. NASA has a journal called JGR 
Planets. Yes, a piece of the traditional JGR

29:25.613 --> 29:30.357
journal. The GSA did something similar, but not 
Geological Society of America, which was not

29:30.337 --> 29:39.293
quite as autonomous. Each one of these responses 
was a little different. The Division for

29:42.739 --> 29:49.752
Planetary Sciences and the AAS rapidly became 
almost entirely autonomous from the AAS. It, in

29:49.772 --> 29:52.497
effect, is a separate society, in my opinion. 
Whereas in the American Geophysical Union, the

29:53.236 --> 30:07.039
planetology section remains a relatively small 
but active section within the union as a whole and

29:53.236 --> 30:07.039
has its sessions with the major meeting of the AGU. 
It's not an autonomous thing. I think that's the

30:09.864 --> 30:13.810
same pattern as the GSA also. I think all of these 
activities were a logical response to the number

30:14.127 --> 30:22.115
of people and the number of ideas working in the 
field. Just to stick in yet a third thing that I've

30:23.296 --> 30:42.835
kind of looked at over the years, there was

30:23.296 --> 30:42.835
a major perturbation and difficulty with trying 
to figure out where the tremendous amount of

30:23.296 --> 30:42.835
information developed from the Apollo samples 
the geochemistry and the subsequent work on

30:43.186 --> 30:49.963
meteorites should go in all of this. If you go back 
to the early days of 69 and the Apollo era, A lot of

30:56.635 --> 31:02.167
the early results were presented at AGU meetings 
and DPS meetings. In fact, some of those people

31:02.227 --> 31:06.096
were founders. Ed Anders was our second 
president, I believe, of the DPS, or chairman of

31:06.256 --> 31:10.827
the DPS. And Anders and the people working in 
geochemistry haven't been involved in detail

31:16.987 --> 31:21.453
with DPS for many years since then. What happened 
was that as a result of the Apollo sample

31:22.454 --> 31:37.214
studies, there in effect grew up a society without 
a society, which was the Lunar Planetary Science

31:22.454 --> 31:37.214
Conference down at Houston. It started out as the 
Lunar Science Conference, and it started out

31:37.234 --> 31:44.023
strictly as a meeting of the PIs on the Apollo 
program. And that's grown into yet another

31:44.864 --> 31:52.395
different accommodation for communication in 
this area. The Meteoritical Society has a similar

31:54.278 --> 31:59.085
type of role. So you rarely see much rock and 
meteorite work presented at the DPS or the AGU

31:59.105 --> 32:05.275
anymore. These other areas tend to have subsumed 
that function. So the fractionation continues.

32:12.792 --> 32:23.386
Well, I think the fractionation existed by 1972 
and hasn't changed too much since then, although

32:12.792 --> 32:23.386
the boundaries of these Venn diagrams overlap. 
People work on doing joint sessions successfully

32:23.446 --> 32:33.579
sometimes, and there are a number of parts of the 
community that tend to go to two or more of these

32:23.446 --> 32:33.579
types of meetings. Do you have much contact with 
astronomers who work on stars, galaxies, and

32:34.400 --> 32:38.445
things like that? Very little, and I think that's 
one of the negative effects of this

32:38.594 --> 32:45.763
fractionation, as you will. In the early days of my 
career, I went to AAS meetings occasionally when

32:45.844 --> 33:02.205
they had sessions on planetary astronomy, and I 
felt that was quite valuable, particularly in

32:45.844 --> 33:02.205
terms of changing information about techniques 
and so forth of observing. But with the growth of

33:02.185 --> 33:13.639
these other things in the types of areas that I'm 
working in, there are two AGU meetings per year, a

33:02.185 --> 33:13.639
DPS meeting, a lunar meeting, to say nothing of 
international meetings. And to try to also, and

33:14.160 --> 33:23.772
I've drifted more into, if you will, the 
geophysical side of some of these things rather

33:14.160 --> 33:23.772
than the pure observational astronomy. So I've 
tended to put the weight of where I operate more on

33:23.752 --> 33:34.148
that side, and it's taken me more away from 
astronomy in a pure astronomical sense. Do you

33:35.410 --> 33:48.510
think the fact that there's now a lot of interest 
among stellar astronomers in formation of other

33:35.410 --> 33:48.510
solar systems offers a chance to maybe bring at 
least those people and DPS types together? I think

33:48.659 --> 33:50.764
we've already seen a bit of that. The fact that we 
don't actually have another solar system yet

33:51.024 --> 34:04.255
identified to form the nucleus or focus of a new 
field of studying extrasolar solar systems has

34:04.235 --> 34:15.128
limited that, but at a number of major meetings 
over the years, in the past few years, we've seen

34:04.235 --> 34:15.128
people of both of those disciplines coming 
together to worry about this problem. I kind of see

34:15.728 --> 34:29.905
this as a cyclic type of thing in history, and I 
think that the information and the techniques of

34:15.728 --> 34:29.905
stellar astronomy are now to the point where They 
are gathering data and the theoretical

34:30.188 --> 34:40.039
constructs are beginning to become available 
that are now relevant to really planetary issues

34:30.188 --> 34:40.039
in other solar systems. I don't think that will 
actually happen in a major way until one or more

34:40.419 --> 34:55.335
real extrasolar systems are identified and we 
actually have some physical data on one or more

34:40.419 --> 34:55.335
planets that aren't in the solar system. You were 
saying that there was a lot of talk and discussion

34:57.526 --> 35:04.340
about voluntary types splitting off from the AAS. 
Would you continue to do that? I was the secretary

35:05.795 --> 35:12.542
treasurer of the DPS for a term back in the 70s. I've 
forgotten the exact years of my office and got

35:12.622 --> 35:20.690
involved in a lot of the council meetings and so 
forth and the DPS committee meetings. And there

35:21.431 --> 35:33.203
were at least a couple of cycles that I remember not 
too clearly as to exact dates where the membership

35:21.431 --> 35:33.203
proposed that it might be a good idea to split away 
from the AAS entirely. And the options were

35:33.183 --> 35:45.488
usually form a separate society, get involved 
with some other society, such as the GSA or the AGU,

35:33.183 --> 35:45.488
Geological Society of America. And those, I 
believe that those discussions were fueled by a

35:45.772 --> 35:54.985
number of different parallel types of problems. 
One of them had to do with sort of logistics,

35:55.106 --> 36:07.223
whether we were being well served by the parent 
organization in terms of where our dues were

35:55.106 --> 36:07.223
going, what we were getting for it other than 
getting abstract published in the BAAS. and

36:07.203 --> 36:16.541
whether the discipline was relevant enough to the 
AAS. The other, if you will, more intellectually

36:17.643 --> 36:29.025
reputable point of view, I think, was that the 
society, the DPS at that time, was already...

36:29.191 --> 36:33.797
drawing a broader community of people to its 
meetings than astronomers. There are a lot of

36:33.817 --> 36:36.440
people who didn't feel themselves to be 
astronomers. They'd come out of geology

36:36.460 --> 36:38.663
departments like myself. I never felt 
particularly strongly about that. I felt that it

36:42.348 --> 36:51.039
was more a matter of pragmatic convenience as to 
where a good place for professional society to be

36:42.348 --> 36:51.039
was. There are also issues about the journal, and I 
think that probably people that were involved

36:55.263 --> 37:02.472
with the genesis of the relationship of the DPS to 
ICRIS could tell you more about that. But there was

37:02.592 --> 37:17.731
a major stumbling block, if you will, I think, in 
the early days is that the membership of the DPS

37:02.592 --> 37:17.731
didn't feel that the AAS journals were serving 
their interest. This is a problem that you

37:18.031 --> 37:21.996
mentioned, the AGU. In fact, a similar set of 
discussions has led very recently to the

37:21.976 --> 37:38.957
formation of a section of the Journal of 
Geophysical Research devoted to planets because

37:21.976 --> 37:38.957
it was felt that that would better serve the 
membership that was interested in planetary

37:21.976 --> 37:38.957
science. Whether that works or not remains to be 
seen. Do you think planetary astronomers have

37:42.081 --> 37:50.852
done a good job of selling themselves, A, to the 
public, and B, to the United States Congress?

37:52.756 --> 37:55.238
Well, I don't know in terms of selling themselves. 
Again, I tend to review these things more in the

37:55.619 --> 38:03.245
context of science as a political and policy issue 
within the government as a whole. I think in terms

38:04.126 --> 38:14.656
of catching public interest and having Congress 
sympathetic to the types of research we're doing,

38:04.126 --> 38:14.656
we have a slightly easy job, actually. I think that 
people relate to the exploration motif and

38:14.956 --> 38:22.763
looking at new worlds They also relate to 
discovering things about black holes. I think you

38:26.531 --> 38:28.816
can get too far over on this. If it's not relevant to 
me today to exploit for some sort of economic

38:29.597 --> 38:37.454
benefit, it isn't going to interest Congress, it 
isn't going to interest the public. I find the

38:37.494 --> 38:38.997
exact opposite. And I think that it's sort of 
interesting in some way that our relativistic

38:38.977 --> 38:55.196
astrophysicists find themselves in a position of 
being, it's as easy to get the public interested in

38:38.977 --> 38:55.196
their thing as it is interested in a lunar base, 
which you might think is much more relevant to a lot

38:38.977 --> 38:55.196
of people's thoughts. From your experiences, 
from the general public you've met, what do they

38:56.938 --> 39:01.764
think of planetary astronomy? Practically 
everybody I've ever met in a social context that

39:06.297 --> 39:13.045
was reasonably well-educated has been very 
interested in it. They find out you're an

39:13.085 --> 39:16.409
astronomer, find out you work with planets. You 
always get lots of questions, very eager

39:17.711 --> 39:23.538
questions, some of them naive, some of them 
somewhat ignorant. And occasionally they,

39:23.858 --> 39:27.182
what's your sign? Did you say you were working in 
astrology? Type of questions. I find that the

39:32.572 --> 39:38.937
educated public in general very interested in 
that. I've rarely gotten an extremely hostile

39:39.187 --> 39:45.854
response as, you know, what the hell are you 
wasting the government's money with that for? I

39:45.894 --> 39:52.901
think a lot of people are worried and frequently 
misinformed about the total amount of money we

39:45.894 --> 39:52.901
spend on these types of things. I think that's one 
of the problems that science and basic science in

39:52.961 --> 40:08.637
general have, that they see the shiny rockets out 
on the launch pads and think that a large fraction

39:52.961 --> 40:08.637
of the national treasury must be pouring into 
those things to satisfy our curiosity. And, of

40:08.617 --> 40:16.028
course, these programs are substantial, but 
they're nowhere near up in even the top five or six

40:08.617 --> 40:16.028
government spending categories. Most people 
don't realize that, but as taxpayers, they're

40:17.069 --> 40:22.217
concerned about whether we're doing the right 
thing. I frequently get questioned about that,

40:22.237 --> 40:26.663
usually in a fairly non-confrontational way. Do 
you think the spectacular results that we've

40:28.065 --> 40:37.138
gotten out of the solar system in the last 30 or 40 
years, do you think that's really changed the way

40:28.065 --> 40:37.138
anybody thinks about anything?

40:39.717 --> 40:44.283
That's more of a question for a sociologist or 
anthropologist. I think it has. I think everybody

40:46.246 --> 40:53.536
now relates to the Earth as a whole picture as seen 
by Apollo pictures and other pictures, you know, a

40:46.246 --> 40:53.536
globe. I think that if you just think about... If 
you show a picture of an object to somebody now with

41:00.065 --> 41:09.117
a bunch of impact craters in it, people understand 
the impacts of... bodies into other bodies over

41:09.502 --> 41:15.251
4.6 billion years is something that's happened. 
Most people that are involved with following

41:15.312 --> 41:22.383
science and astronomy at all sort of have that in 
their background knowledge now. Back in the 50s

41:23.104 --> 41:33.822
and 60s, you probably couldn't find one person in a 
thousand that knew that the holes in the moon were

41:23.104 --> 41:33.822
created by meteorites slamming into them or 
asteroid or cometary debris. And at that time,

41:34.139 --> 41:40.885
people didn't even really know the length of time 
or the time scales that these things had been done

41:34.139 --> 41:40.885
over. I think there's a tremendous amount of 
shared knowledge about our history in the solar

41:40.905 --> 41:50.313
system that has crept into the public 
consciousness without anybody really noticing

41:40.905 --> 41:50.313
it. It's not just a matter of flashy pictures in the 
textbooks. How much, if any, negative effect on

41:56.278 --> 42:04.045
public interest and public funding of planetary 
astronomy

42:05.965 --> 42:18.480
How much of a negative impact on those two things do 
you think our failure to find any evidence of life

42:05.965 --> 42:18.480
anywhere else in the solar system except 
particularly not on Mars has had? I think that's

42:20.443 --> 42:31.416
been overblown a bit, just as I felt that the 
original raison d'etre of Mars exploration being

42:20.443 --> 42:31.416
nothing but the search for life was also 
overblown. I think people are somewhat

42:31.717 --> 42:49.103
disappointed, but I think that in fact, again, in 
terms of this kind of shared cultural knowledge of

42:31.717 --> 42:49.103
where we are, who we are, and what the solar system 
is, they now know that there aren't little green

42:31.717 --> 42:49.103
men on Mars, and they're not... Most of them. Most 
of them do. The others are uneducable, so

42:51.727 --> 42:59.479
that's... And I think people were disappointed, 
but... I think that's taking the universe as it is,

43:00.083 --> 43:07.295
rather than wanting it to be the way somebody might 
make it. I think that

43:07.756 --> 43:25.264
interest, if you will, the interest that was 
wrapped up in the search for life on Mars now has

43:07.756 --> 43:25.264
shifted to perhaps more subtle problems of the 
history of life on the Earth, the effects of impact

43:07.756 --> 43:25.264
on evolution on the Earth. the origins of life 
itself in terms of the chemistry brought in by

43:25.733 --> 43:42.490
comets and impacting debris, and the possibility 
of there having been false starts at getting life

43:25.733 --> 43:42.490
going in other environments, looking for fossils 
on Mars, if you will. I find people still very

43:43.611 --> 43:54.002
interested in these things, interested in the 
concept of other worlds and other solar systems

43:43.611 --> 43:54.002
beyond the solar system that might harbor life 
Quite frankly, I don't think I've ever had anybody

43:55.838 --> 44:02.810
come up to me and say, the solar system, the 
planetary program should be shut down now. We know

44:02.890 --> 44:04.132
there isn't life on Mars. That's all we were doing 
it for. I never really run into much of that

44:05.835 --> 44:08.820
reaction. Looking at your crystal ball a minute, 
what do you see for the future of planetary

44:10.723 --> 44:18.336
astronomy and planetary science for the next 10 
years or so? I think it's in a mode of

44:19.784 --> 44:22.026
consolidation. Now, right at the moment, you 
could say we're in a... You could be very negative

44:22.046 --> 44:27.932
right at the moment. I personally feel the 
situation with respect to leadership in

44:27.972 --> 44:33.297
Washington at this instant is quite bad. I don't 
think that the right resources... I don't think

44:37.300 --> 44:45.108
we've got realism in the resources and 
constraints and plans for planetary work. But I

44:45.528 --> 44:47.530
also think there's a very large... a base of firm 
understanding of what we should be doing that will

44:48.016 --> 44:57.240
carry the country through to a reasonable 
continuity ultimately. And what I see is sort of

44:58.022 --> 45:00.509
consolidation. I see a lot of work exploiting what 
we can do from the ground and from Earth-based

45:03.338 --> 45:10.228
astronomy, that's Earth orbital astronomy. That 
has really grown. It's easier to do than the big

45:11.650 --> 45:15.255
major outer planets missions. I see that there's 
the emphasis on small missions. I think we are

45:21.945 --> 45:24.208
going to have more small missions. I think that 
they're not going to be as mind-blowing and

45:29.022 --> 45:35.991
revealing as a few of the big missions have been, 
but they're going to be addressing very relevant,

45:29.022 --> 45:35.991
very interesting questions. We'll be able to deal 
with that. So I think if you think about it in DPS

45:38.114 --> 45:52.673
context, we're going to have a lot of 
nitty-gritty, hard science returns from a number

45:38.114 --> 45:52.673
of ways and fewer of the big breakthroughs, oh, we 
never knew that that was going on there again. But I

45:52.713 --> 45:56.818
think that's inevitable with the maturing of any 
field is that... I've always liked a comment that

45:56.798 --> 46:02.806
Carl Sagan made many years ago, is you only explore 
the solar system for the first time once. So you

46:04.628 --> 46:06.931
don't think the field is mined out by any extent? 
Oh, no, no. Any more than the field of geology was

46:08.113 --> 46:12.038
mined out in the 19th century. Last few years, 
there's been a lot of attention and certainly a lot

46:14.301 --> 46:22.853
of publicity directed towards making planetary 
astronomy practical. And I think things like

46:23.173 --> 46:26.097
ozone layer studies... global warming, killer 
asteroids and comets. Do you think that's been

46:31.264 --> 46:34.173
overdone, or do you think we ought to do everything 
we can? Or do you think if it's good science, so what

46:34.274 --> 46:37.263
if it gets publicity? Your personal opinion. I 
think we ought to let people know what's relevant

46:40.184 --> 46:43.828
about our science. You always face the issue of 
over-hyping something and getting out on a limb

46:44.069 --> 46:54.782
and stating things that are really warped in terms 
of their perspective. Not true. In the worst case,

46:55.463 --> 47:06.937
actually, you know, dropping into charlatanism, 
trying to sell something on a flashy basis that has

46:55.463 --> 47:06.937
no substance. I would not accuse... anybody of 
that in a major way in the instances you just

47:08.281 --> 47:13.033
measured. I believe there's a firm basis to most of 
those types of studies, which is important to

47:13.093 --> 47:22.577
people.
