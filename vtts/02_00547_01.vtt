WEBVTT

00:01.735 --> 00:06.762
All

00:01.735 --> 00:06.762
right. Let's start with your background. Could 
you summarize your early background? Summarize

00:11.768 --> 00:12.810
my early background? And how it prepared you for 
being a test pilot and an astronaut.

00:20.740 --> 00:30.713
A lot of luck was involved because my early 
background consisted of doing just what I wanted

00:20.740 --> 00:30.713
to do, which would be an airplane pilot. So when I 
went to the University of Texas I took

00:31.267 --> 00:38.837
aeronautical engineering because I thought it 
would make me a better airplane pilot. So I was an

00:38.877 --> 00:47.569
aeronautical engineer and then I went to Navy 
flight training and then became a test pilot and

00:38.877 --> 00:47.569
then ended up being an astronaut. So each step 
built on the previous step, although a lot of it was

00:47.589 --> 00:51.874
luck. Particularly the transition from test 
pilot to astronaut because when I Began all this, I

00:57.676 --> 01:02.144
never even thought about astronauts or space 
flight or anything like that. Okay, you said you

01:03.726 --> 01:06.331
went into NASA as a naval aviator. How important do 
you feel that that was in your selection and also

01:06.892 --> 01:13.503
your career? Would it have been different had you 
gone in as a civilian? As a civilian or you mean an

01:18.432 --> 01:21.598
Air Force or something like that? Well, no, just 
basically as a civilian without the military, the

01:21.618 --> 01:28.031
active military that you went in on. Well, now, to 
be an astronaut, you've got to have, at that

01:28.652 --> 01:37.470
period, you had to have lots of high-performance 
aircraft flying equipment. You can only get that

01:37.805 --> 01:39.788
in the military. So everybody that came in, came in 
as someone

01:39.828 --> 01:49.562
that had been in the military to amass the flight 
experience. Once you were in, I don't think it

01:50.924 --> 01:54.970
really made a lot of difference. as long as you were 
perceived as a pilot kind of person. Because, for

01:58.856 --> 02:08.591
example, Neil Armstrong came in as a civilian, 
even though he had formerly been, I guess, in the

01:58.856 --> 02:08.591
Navy. So I think as long as you were perceived as a 
pilot kind of person, that it didn't make any

02:11.275 --> 02:19.388
difference whether you were Air Force, Navy, 
Marines, or civilian. All right. You spent 18

02:22.779 --> 02:26.705
years at NASA, 1963 to 1981. How did your 
participation or the role you played change over

02:27.045 --> 02:33.453
those years?

02:37.158 --> 02:43.907
Well, when you first get to NASA, you're in a very 
much of a training situation where you're trying

02:44.461 --> 02:48.766
to mostly understand what the job is you've been 
hired to do. I mean, you want to go fly in space, but

02:48.786 --> 02:57.256
you really don't have the opportunity and they 
have you doing a lot of other support sorts of

02:48.786 --> 02:57.256
things and training things. And so you're, at 
least I was a little bit lost trying to understand

02:57.956 --> 03:08.468
what my function was other than just, I kept 
wanting somebody to tell me what to do, which they

02:57.956 --> 03:08.468
never did. After you've been there a number, for a 
while, then you're assigned to a flight crew Then

03:14.920 --> 03:29.657
you begin training for a mission and that's, it's 
harder work but it's simpler because you have a

03:14.920 --> 03:29.657
certain thing to do in a certain length of time and 
so you can sit down and determine how to do it. Now in

03:29.697 --> 03:32.203
my case it was very fortunate because I work with 
Pete Conrad, and he knew very much how to train for

03:32.538 --> 03:47.533
missions and what to do on space missions, so he 
taught me quite a lot, much more than maybe most of

03:32.538 --> 03:47.533
the other people, just because he knows a lot. So in 
that phase of your time there, as long as you're on a

03:47.553 --> 03:59.845
flight crew, on a backup flight crew, you're 
training for a mission or flying it or then getting

03:47.553 --> 03:59.845
ready to train for the next one and So you're doing 
that function which is the most interesting

04:00.179 --> 04:09.445
function there and of course the function that you 
always want to be in. Then after the Russian

04:10.508 --> 04:15.623
mission, I was the backup commander of that 
mission, then there was quite a way before anybody

04:15.974 --> 04:20.382
flew in space shuttle. And so all of us were in a mode 
where we worked on the space shuttle in an

04:21.023 --> 04:28.437
engineering sense, engineering supports it. A 
little bit like when I first came there, except

04:28.798 --> 04:36.733
this time some of the new ones worked for me doing 
the same thing. As time passed, they selected

04:36.815 --> 04:42.443
people to fly the early shuttles, and I wasn't 
selected to do that. I was selected to work with the

04:42.463 --> 04:49.994
new astronaut candidates and serve sort of as an 
administrative officer for all the astronauts.

04:50.655 --> 04:57.064
So I did that for the last two years that I was at 
NASA, and I enjoyed it very much. It would have been

04:57.084 --> 05:05.556
very frustrating to me if I hadn't flown to be in 
that role, but having flown to be in that role

04:57.084 --> 05:05.556
was... nice, I enjoyed working with the people, 
and it was sort of like paying a little of the debt I

05:06.143 --> 05:30.565
had for having had some nice experiences, so all in 
all, I felt my career at NASA was, although I would

05:06.143 --> 05:30.565
never have done it exactly that way at the time, 
looking back on it, it turned out really nice, so

05:06.143 --> 05:30.565
I've been very happy about the 18 years, and felt 
that Felt that I stayed long enough so that I was

05:31.979 --> 05:36.365
ready to go. One of the things, I liked it being at 
NASA and I wanted to make sure that I didn't leave

05:36.405 --> 05:44.336
too early and then look back on it and wish that I 
were still there. And that wasn't the case. I felt

05:46.098 --> 05:49.383
like I was there until I finally said, you know, 
it's time for me to go. So that felt good also. And

05:51.886 --> 05:52.907
that's the way I feel now. Okay. What impact did 
your career have on your family? Well, it had a big

05:58.642 --> 06:09.472
impact on my family, although I'm not sure exactly 
how it had the impact. If I just looked at the

06:09.932 --> 06:15.477
results of my family, then I would say that it had a 
big impact. First of all, I guess was my son, who

06:17.599 --> 06:28.108
was, when I went to the moon, he was about, let's 
see, I was 69. And, uh, he was born in 55, so that

06:28.966 --> 06:33.871
would make him 14 years old. Um, seemed to have a big 
effect on him. The fact that I was gone a lot, uh,

06:37.194 --> 06:52.569
seemed to, um, seemed to make, seemed to make him, 
uh, I don't know what aspect of it, but he grew up to

06:37.194 --> 06:52.569
be a fairly rebellious, uh, son. And he, uh, He 
never wanted, and still doesn't, tends to not want

06:55.308 --> 07:04.664
to do things in the way he thinks that I might do 
them. So he, somehow over this period, he got the

07:05.546 --> 07:16.084
feeling that he wanted to live his life 
differently than I did. Whether that would have

07:16.655 --> 07:19.678
happened if I hadn't been in the space program or 
not, I don't know. But that is an effect that

07:19.758 --> 07:21.861
occurred. My daughter, who was seven years old 
when I went to the moon, she didn't seem to bother

07:22.541 --> 07:31.511
her so much. And so I see her as growing up in rather a 
normal fashion and seems to behave... with good

07:40.820 --> 07:49.352
and bad features of, uh, that, uh, of, uh, she's a 
freshman at the university of Texas. So, and she's

07:49.372 --> 07:52.656
probably going to do real well there. Uh, my 
marriage, I was divorced about five years ago. And

07:55.941 --> 08:08.278
I think probably the space program had a lot to do 
with that in that, uh, when you're gone a lot and,

07:55.941 --> 08:08.278
uh, the running of the family and the decisions 
moves over to the woman, Then when you come back, as

08:08.883 --> 08:24.879
I did five years or so after I got back, then the man 
then wants to take over the decisions, and that

08:08.883 --> 08:24.879
gets difficult because it's a lot more fun in a 
family to make decisions than follow them. So I

08:26.000 --> 08:34.608
think that the space program had a big effect on my 
family, and whether or not it would have had it if I

08:26.000 --> 08:34.608
had stayed in the Navy, I don't really know. But it 
did, in fact, have a big effect. When you were

08:39.072 --> 08:46.004
growing up, your generation was just ahead of the 
youth movement and Vietnam War demonstrations.

08:46.986 --> 08:49.530
Some of the newer astronauts today are from that 
generation. Do you see any indication of the youth

08:49.570 --> 08:52.575
trend in the 60s? Do you see any effects from that in 
some of the newly chosen astronauts?

09:03.372 --> 09:06.922
No, but it may be because I'm not sensitive to it. If 
I talked with them about those issues, probably

09:07.002 --> 09:17.753
they would have considerably different opinions 
than maybe I have.

09:19.285 --> 09:32.366
Since at NASA you tend to work on the space shuttle 
and the job at hand, which has little to do with the

09:19.285 --> 09:32.366
politics of things, you don't really know how 
people feel about the politics of the matter. The

09:34.991 --> 09:45.748
thing that I've noticed mostly about new 
astronauts is the fact that women astronauts are

09:34.991 --> 09:45.748
technically and mentally and emotionally just as 
capable as male astronauts and that effect is sort

09:46.150 --> 10:02.640
of surprising because I don't think women of my 
generation most of them, or many of them, had the

10:03.093 --> 10:15.181
same attitudes that would have let them be as good 
professional astronauts as the women of this

10:03.093 --> 10:15.181
particular generation. And it is just an 
attitude. I mean, their attitude is... You know,

10:18.871 --> 10:25.299
it goes without saying that I'm just as capable as 
anybody else, regardless of sex. And then when you

10:25.700 --> 10:28.544
watch them, they are just as capable. Perhaps in my 
generation, since it would be more unusual, a

10:29.024 --> 10:36.955
woman might have an attitude that says, I'm just as 
capable as a man. And to have that attitude is not as

10:37.856 --> 10:40.980
good as... just not even hardly thinking about it, 
but having that feeling. So that's the big

10:46.324 --> 10:48.006
difference I've noticed. I've also noticed that 
the men and the women accept each other as the role

10:48.026 --> 10:59.219
of astronaut, just as equals, and that's just the 
way it is. There's no strain or anything else that

10:59.259 --> 11:03.964
would make you think that... The male astronauts 
think the female astronauts don't belong or

11:04.248 --> 11:08.414
anything like that. How has the training changed 
through the presence of women? It's not changed

11:14.802 --> 11:16.805
much at all. The thing that occurred when we got 
women is we realized that many of them were smaller

11:17.506 --> 11:29.082
than the men and also that they weren't as strong in 
the arms and hands. So what we did was... was make

11:33.577 --> 11:49.122
sure that everything that had to be operated in 
space shuttle, like the space suits, the controls

11:33.577 --> 11:49.122
and all that, would work with the female size body 
and also with typical female strength. And once we

11:49.861 --> 11:56.409
did that, then

11:49.861 --> 11:56.409
the training is pretty much the same. If you take a 
job that requires this kind of strength, the man

11:56.869 --> 12:04.959
can probably do it more easily than the woman just 
because he's stronger. But both of them can still

12:05.039 --> 12:07.962
do it adequately. I relate it in my own mind to... to 
trucks getting power steering. Once trucks got

12:15.122 --> 12:21.454
power steering, women could drive trucks just as 
easily as men and were just as good as drivers.

12:23.337 --> 12:29.409
Before that, it was difficult because the actual 
job of steering a truck was so physically

12:23.337 --> 12:29.409
demanding. I feel that their training is no 
different. you relate to a woman astronaut just

12:35.744 --> 12:58.731
like she's a male astronaut and uh nobody asks for 
special favors you don't see everybody treats the

12:35.744 --> 12:58.731
women nicely but i mean you they never ask to be uh 
excused from anything difficult or don't uh seem

12:35.744 --> 12:58.731
to feel that they have any uh special um called to 
get any extra treatment or soft treatment. And so

13:05.226 --> 13:10.253
everybody does the job, and it seems to work out 
real well. The Apollo program's goal is to send man

13:12.376 --> 13:15.681
to the moon. After this was accomplished, what was 
the change, or did you notice any in public

13:16.001 --> 13:26.136
opinion, Congress's attitude also towards NASA 
and the manned program? Well, my feeling is that

13:28.580 --> 13:47.960
the public attitude towards anything is largely 
controlled by what the president wants, and then

13:28.580 --> 13:47.960
when the newspapers and television people sense 
what he wants, then they kind of jump on the

13:28.580 --> 13:47.960
bandwagon. So, and Congress is sort of separate, 
and they... They have their own opinion. For

13:54.958 --> 14:10.262
example, I think that Congress related to the 
space program is just as much in favor of it as they

13:54.958 --> 14:10.262
ever were, and they always give you as much money as 
the president asked for, and they do things that

13:54.958 --> 14:10.262
the president wants done, and no problem at all. 
The problem we have is getting our budget... what

14:14.851 --> 14:18.376
we're looking for to have the president say that's 
what he's looking for. So any cuts we've ever

14:18.957 --> 14:23.664
received have been from the president himself.

14:26.468 --> 14:37.986
I think that

14:26.468 --> 14:37.986
then when the president does have an attitude, and 
then that is carried along to the rest of the

14:26.468 --> 14:37.986
people. For example, if he starts talking about, 
if he started talking to Mara about the fact we

14:43.167 --> 14:45.189
needed a space station. He was very enthusiastic 
about it and said we told a bunch of good reasons why

14:45.869 --> 14:55.738
and there are a bunch of good reasons why we should 
do it and there are a bunch of good reasons why we

14:45.869 --> 14:55.738
shouldn't. If he started talking about the good 
ones tomorrow and kept after it for a while and was

14:56.119 --> 15:13.174
committed to it, pretty soon the newspapers would 
talk about it all the time and everybody in the U.S.

14:56.119 --> 15:13.174
suddenly would be in favor of it and would talk 
about how wonderful and how the space program is

14:56.119 --> 15:13.174
going crazy and they like it and that's what they 
thought about. If he doesn't do that, which he

15:13.154 --> 15:19.160
hasn't, then they, in my opinion, don't perceive 
it that way. And everyone sort of begins to say, why

15:19.821 --> 15:26.748
is the space program different than it was? They 
personally don't feel any different, but they've

15:27.188 --> 15:36.838
been barraged by the statement from the press that 
it's different, that they wonder why it's

15:27.188 --> 15:36.838
different. So you seldom meet a person that 
doesn't feel about the space program just as he did

15:36.858 --> 15:42.143
in Apollo. That is... If they were in favor of it 
then, they're in favor of it now. And if they

15:46.637 --> 15:48.659
weren't then, they weren't now. So you've got to 
say, generally, public opinion is probably about

15:49.941 --> 15:56.248
the same from the individual. How did that opinion 
affect the objectives of the pilot program? Did

16:03.357 --> 16:09.164
that affect what you thought you could do or what 
you said you could do in that program? Concern for

16:10.385 --> 16:11.967
those opinions? Well, the opinion allowed you... 
Well, the opinion was that we were going to do

16:12.352 --> 16:21.060
whatever we had to do to get to the moon and back. And 
we're going to give you the money to do it. The

16:24.383 --> 16:30.608
minute you have that opinion, then you can go out 
and do whatever is necessary to get to the moon and

16:24.383 --> 16:30.608
back. And you know you can. So you have an attitude 
of, you know, I can do it because you know you can. If

16:36.954 --> 16:41.498
Midway and Apollo, the president decided not to 
support it for one reason or another... then it

16:41.832 --> 16:47.939
would have changed our attitude because we 
immediately would know we wouldn't have the money

16:41.832 --> 16:47.939
to do it. We wouldn't have the support. So even 
though technically we could do it, we wouldn't

16:52.084 --> 16:56.890
have been able to. We'd have had to not do it. Like 
now we know we could go to Mars, but nobody wants to

16:57.931 --> 17:01.755
do it. Nobody's gonna pay to do it. So it's not like 
we're running around saying, NASA's running

17:02.937 --> 17:08.143
around saying, you know, we can go to Mars. I mean, 
you could, but nobody's going to pay. So really,

17:11.150 --> 17:15.715
you'd have to say we can't. It doesn't have the 
popular support. You need popular support to get

17:18.858 --> 17:21.580
the money. Once you get the money, you can do it. If 
everybody in the country were against you and you

17:24.783 --> 17:34.553
still had the money,

17:24.783 --> 17:34.553
you could go get it done because you could hire 
people to do it. probably not as efficient because

17:35.191 --> 17:45.268
people wouldn't dedicate themselves, but still 
in all, with the right amount of money, you could

17:35.191 --> 17:45.268
buy the technology to do it. Okay, Congress also, 
in the late 60s, cut back on appropriations, which

17:45.449 --> 17:53.963
cut out the last three Apollo flights. Looking 
back on that, do you feel that was a good, bad

17:54.604 --> 17:57.970
decision? I mean, how do you feel now about that? 
that cut in your budget? Well, I feel that that's

18:03.787 --> 18:07.751
what Congress is there for. They're there to 
decide where money should be spent. And the fact

18:11.416 --> 18:20.526
they wanted to cut those out,

18:11.416 --> 18:20.526
I think from somebody in the space program, they 
wish they hadn't. But at the same time,

18:21.247 --> 18:29.297
from Congress's point of view, they wish they did 
and did. I mean, I don't... I don't ever think that,

18:30.743 --> 18:47.537
personally, that one of my favorite sayings is, 
history draws straight with crooked lines, which

18:30.743 --> 18:47.537
fundamentally means that things eventually 
happen or don't happen no matter what human beings

18:30.743 --> 18:47.537
try to do about it. So even though they vote money or 
don't vote money over the next 10 years, man is

18:47.838 --> 18:54.650
going to slowly get out into space. He's going to 
find ways to make it profitable, and he's going to

18:54.710 --> 18:58.597
go out there more and more. And whether it takes 
place 10 years from now or 20 years from now, it

18:59.218 --> 19:04.928
isn't going to make any difference. Any more than 
it'd make any difference if Columbus discovered

19:04.968 --> 19:08.715
America in 1910. 1592 or 1492. I mean, who cares? 
And it was important at that moment. But sooner or

19:16.466 --> 19:20.872
later, somebody would have found out the world was 
round and come over here. If it hadn't been

19:21.874 --> 19:23.917
Columbus, it would have been somebody else. If we 
don't go up into space in the next 10 years, if we

19:23.957 --> 19:30.586
don't fly the last three flights to the moon, you 
know, who cares? Someday people will live on the

19:31.527 --> 19:34.051
moon and they'll never worry. It's like wondering 
why... three or four white Columbus didn't take

19:36.185 --> 19:40.412
eight ships instead of three. I mean, at the 
moment, at the point, he could have said as he left

19:40.572 --> 19:49.847
the country, well, look, I could start settling 
the New World myself if I find it. However, we look

19:51.129 --> 19:52.932
back now, we don't know. I mean, we can't even tell 
he had three ships or a hundred. So I don't really

19:55.556 --> 19:59.061
worry about that sort of thing. Plus, I don't think 
the individual, unless he's president... can do

20:03.370 --> 20:04.532
anything about it. And I think it's good not to 
worry about things you can't do anything about

20:04.872 --> 20:12.102
because it is needless worry. You were one of 12 men 
to walk on the moon. Ten years later, it's almost a,

20:15.046 --> 20:20.213
what do we have here today? So what kind of thing? 
What is there today that is a result of that? What is

20:28.966 --> 20:29.987
the legacy? What is the legacy? Good question. I 
think the legacy of going to the moon is just a good

20:33.458 --> 20:42.671
feeling in everybody's heart that America can do 
the things it wants to do. I think that's probably

20:42.691 --> 20:45.935
the number one thing we got from it. The other is it 
gives us a good feeling about what we can do in the

20:47.117 --> 20:53.245
future. I think most of exploration has to do with 
just man feeling good about himself and...

21:03.226 --> 21:28.575
wanting to do it and it lifts the human spirit and he 
feels good and thinks good about it and you start

21:03.226 --> 21:28.575
talking about Apollo program to anybody now they 
start you can see them brighten up they think about

21:03.226 --> 21:28.575
when they were where they were during Apollo and 
they think about where they were during the first

21:03.226 --> 21:28.575
landing and they like it it makes them feel good 
about America and it makes them feel good about

21:03.226 --> 21:28.575
themselves and Even the ones that don't like the 
space program like that. So I think that's what you

21:32.038 --> 21:36.684
get from something like that. Eventually, of 
course, people will move out into space and live.

21:42.311 --> 21:52.403
And so you could then say, well, if we didn't have 
the space program, it would have taken that much

21:42.311 --> 21:52.403
longer to go out there and begin to have 
settlements on the moon. But I don't think that's

21:54.121 --> 21:57.545
really important in the long run when you do it. You 
think all the money and everything else is worth it

21:57.706 --> 22:01.450
for the feeling? Oh, yeah. I think so. I think 
probably more than that because a country's

22:03.052 --> 22:11.423
ability to survive or not depends a lot on mental 
attitude. If you feel like you're a worthy country

22:13.406 --> 22:19.774
and that you can lick anything and that nobody can 
beat you down... and that you can solve any problem

22:20.362 --> 22:29.313
and that you're the greatest country in the world 
and you're willing to sacrifice for it, that you

22:20.362 --> 22:29.313
probably can do that. But if you get to feeling like 
despair and that other people are beating you and

22:29.814 --> 22:47.095
that you don't do anything right and there's 
really no use in trying for good goals even just

22:29.814 --> 22:47.095
because they're good, then I think that's what 
happens. You know, most countries don't get...

22:51.192 --> 23:17.841
wiped out from the outside they sort of decay from 
the inside and lose their spirit and everything

22:51.192 --> 23:17.841
and then somebody comes in from the outside and 
takes them but before that happens they've lost

22:51.192 --> 23:17.841
their spirit and I think things like Apollo keep 
keep your spirit up and keep you feeling competent

22:51.192 --> 23:17.841
and good and worthy and all those things like right 
now you just read so much about how the United

22:51.192 --> 23:17.841
States has difficulty, can't do this. You know, 
really we can, but

23:21.635 --> 23:28.924
it's just what people write about or what they talk 
about. And Apollo, they think how great we were,

23:28.964 --> 23:32.788
how great this country is. So I think it's worth 
that. And I think we ought to keep doing that

23:34.691 --> 23:38.896
because we need things like that. You need things 
that...

23:44.095 --> 23:59.518
You know, the human body needs food to keep itself 
physically strong, and it needs exercise, and it

23:44.095 --> 23:59.518
needs something on its mind to be mentally strong 
and mentally feel good. And I think Apollo made

23:59.538 --> 24:03.905
this, you know, gave us good mental vibes. Even you 
talk about it now, it gives you good vibes. You're

24:05.908 --> 24:09.613
doing a report on something that happened 10 years 
ago, and... You know, it makes you feel good. If you

24:11.714 --> 24:14.357
did one on the Vietnam War, we'd all feel bad. So 
that's what you need. You've got to have things

24:16.679 --> 24:22.245
that are good going on, and you have to pay for them. 
Nothing's free, and so if you want something good

24:22.545 --> 24:28.911
going on, you're going to have to sacrifice and pay 
for it. You also played a key role in Skylab. What do

24:31.574 --> 24:39.482
you think its main returns are besides proving 
that man can stay in space for long periods of time?

24:45.200 --> 24:48.105
Well, there's some scientific return. I don't 
know that all that's really important. I don't

24:52.292 --> 24:52.693
know. I guess it's once again the good feeling you 
get about being part of progress and being part of

24:52.713 --> 25:09.621
great adventures and moving civilization along 
in a good way. Of course, when you do all this, you

25:10.630 --> 25:17.140
build your technology and everything so that you 
maybe can defend yourself better if some country

25:10.630 --> 25:17.140
tried to take you over. I don't think that's as 
important. But I think a lot of it just has to do with

25:19.644 --> 25:26.614
doing something that's good. I mean, you can spend 
your life trying to clean up the slums. You ain't

25:31.702 --> 25:32.503
going to make it. As someone said, Johnson's War on 
Poverty, poverty won. It did. He spent millions of

25:36.888 --> 25:49.520
dollars, got us in difficulties and he was going to 
clean up poverty and I don't know how much poverty

25:36.888 --> 25:49.520
he cleaned up, probably not all that much because 
it's still around and we've kind of forgotten the

25:36.888 --> 25:49.520
war on poverty. It probably cost a hell of a lot more 
than going to the moon back, okay? But... But we

25:54.337 --> 25:55.639
remember going to the moon. It makes us feel good. 
So I think we ought to spend a lot of money to help

25:57.361 --> 26:04.952
poor people, but we're going to have to spend a lot 
of money to help everybody have a good feeling,

25:57.361 --> 26:04.952
too. I mean, there's more to life than eating. And 
you ought to be able to eat, and then you ought to be

26:08.597 --> 26:13.124
able to have some things for the human spirit. And I 
believe things like Apollo are really great for

26:13.865 --> 26:17.871
the human spirit. It makes us feel good. Okay, 
going back to the selection process, how did it

26:20.375 --> 26:27.927
have to change for the inclusion of women? Was 
there physical requirements that had to change?

26:32.954 --> 26:40.546
Was that basically the only... Well, we knew that 
there weren't women that had the background. With

26:40.746 --> 26:44.993
the shuttle, we knew we were going to need two kinds 
of people. We were going to need the kind of people

26:45.574 --> 26:47.817
to fly it, And then we're going to need the kind of 
people to be the scientists in it or the part

26:47.915 --> 26:55.542
scientist, part technician. And so we realized 
there weren't any women pilots at the moment,

26:56.383 --> 27:04.911
although they're coming along now, that had the 
flying experience equal to the men. We didn't care

27:04.951 --> 27:06.693
whether they were women and men. We were looking 
for the best qualified. So we knew we wouldn't get

27:08.955 --> 27:16.622
any women there, although we know in the future we 
will because women are getting in airlines and the

27:08.955 --> 27:16.622
military flying and all that other stuff. Then the 
next thing was looking for the best scientist. And

27:21.802 --> 27:37.346
we then tried to be completely arbitrary

27:21.802 --> 27:37.346
in that we tried to pick out the best scientists 
available without regard to the fact they were

27:21.802 --> 27:37.346
woman or man. In other words, we... We rated 
everybody according to their desirability

27:39.383 --> 27:47.520
without referencing whether they were a man or a 
woman. Now that's hard to do because you know

27:48.041 --> 27:51.368
you're like some women. coming in in addition to 
men. But that was sort of the effort. So I'm sure

27:55.119 --> 28:05.611
what we did was end up with a good combination of the 
best people, of which some of them fortunately

27:55.119 --> 28:05.611
turned out to be women. As I watched the new 
astronauts, I felt that some of the best ones there

28:05.651 --> 28:12.239
were women. I mean, I didn't feel like we had a bunch 
of great guys, you know, and then we had number

28:18.027 --> 28:45.638
women that work too grand you know but we had to take 
him anyway I never felt that way and I was work close

28:18.027 --> 28:45.638
with it closely with him for a number of years I felt 
that some of the women were the very best there and

28:18.027 --> 28:45.638
the one characteristic I noticed about the women I 
felt as a group that they worked harder than the men

28:18.027 --> 28:45.638
and maybe they had to do that to make it as a woman I 
don't know but if you evaluated what they were

28:18.027 --> 28:45.638
doing on the weekend or after hours or something, 
they usually were doing, taking flying lessons or

28:46.057 --> 28:54.832
running. I mean, they spent more of their waking 
hours becoming good astronauts than the men did, I

28:55.152 --> 29:01.042
felt. Although the men were tremendously 
dedicated, maybe when you find a dedicated woman,

29:01.142 --> 29:07.473
she is even more dedicated. So that was impressive 
to me. What about the other minorities? There's

29:11.830 --> 29:13.873
blacks and Hispanic. Do you see any difference at 
all, I guess, with the WASP and the minority? I

29:21.121 --> 29:31.354
think the backgrounds of the minorities

29:21.121 --> 29:31.354
seem more different.

29:33.957 --> 29:35.419
The background they bring... to the astronaut 
corps seems more different from the older

29:36.783 --> 29:44.072
astronauts than the women bring to the astronaut 
corps. So I think maybe, and all of them are not the

29:45.594 --> 29:54.925
same either, some are more closer to the same 
background in most of the WASP and some are further

29:45.594 --> 29:54.925
away. I think their adjustment into the corps 
probably

30:03.412 --> 30:05.394
probably is more difficult than the women. 
However, the individuals we brought were very

30:06.055 --> 30:13.785
adaptable anyway, because they essentially made 
it in a white man's world. Not our world, but the

30:14.285 --> 30:16.007
outside world. So that indicates they're smart, 
dedicated, and they know how to adapt. But I still

30:23.576 --> 30:28.963
think that their job of integrating Not because of 
prejudice either. I don't think you see that. I

30:32.091 --> 30:33.995
really don't see any prejudice around there. But 
just because of their background and

30:36.019 --> 30:44.455
experiences, I think they probably had a more 
difficult time integrating into the astronaut

30:36.019 --> 30:44.455
corps than the women did. Can you just basically 
maybe go over the selection process, just the

30:45.599 --> 30:55.369
areas that you look at in the selection process? 
Say education. I've never been on a selection

30:57.311 --> 31:00.495
board, so that's one thing. I don't know for sure. 
But what it appears to do is you have a number of

31:02.537 --> 31:11.286
categories like physical condition or physical 
abilities professional abilities and then

31:12.008 --> 31:40.412
finally sort of an intangible attitude abilities 
and so for example you give all your

31:12.008 --> 31:40.412
candidates a finalist some number that you 
determine are the best of the group physical

31:12.008 --> 31:40.412
examinations uh physical tests such as hearing 
such as blood tests such as uh running such as all

31:40.848 --> 32:00.325
sorts of things to look at how they are physically 
and then when you do that then you give them sort of a

31:40.848 --> 32:00.325
grade of like one to two hundred and uh If a person 
was perfect in everything, I guess he'd get 100.

32:03.918 --> 32:06.582
But let's say if you're really good, you'd 
probably get 90 or 85. Sometimes if you have some

32:08.004 --> 32:22.948
disease or some abnormality that would drop you 
below a certain level, then no matter how much you

32:08.004 --> 32:22.948
made in the other two areas, you couldn't make it 
because your physical condition wouldn't be good

32:08.004 --> 32:22.948
enough. But you get a certain numerical rating, 
let's say. And that's further broken down into

32:26.360 --> 32:31.684
areas like fiscal conditioning, where a person 
could improve that. Where blood pressure, maybe

32:32.207 --> 32:34.075
they can't. vision uh maybe they can or can't you 
know things like that then you look at background

32:34.915 --> 32:59.640
you just take a look and see what people have done in 
the past what opportunities they've had to do

32:34.915 --> 32:59.640
things for example we took people that have been 
out of school a long time so their experience level

32:34.915 --> 32:59.640
they ought to get a pretty good rating however we 
did take some people recently out of college with

32:34.915 --> 32:59.640
advanced degrees and they really had done little 
other than be in college and uh and get their

32:59.620 --> 33:00.621
degree. So they didn't have an opportunity to, 
let's say, make a nice discovery or write 100

33:00.922 --> 33:07.691
papers because they hadn't been out. So you give a 
grade relative to their professional competence

33:08.672 --> 33:27.518
by

33:08.672 --> 33:27.518
the fact that we have people that are competent in 
those fields and they can talk to them and they can

33:08.672 --> 33:27.518
go talk with their professors or the people they 
work with and determine how they stack up. Then you

33:28.139 --> 33:34.673
bring them in and you have their ratings for 
general attitude. You interview them. You talk

33:36.637 --> 33:44.072
with them about what they've been doing and you can 
see how much of their life they've been devoting

33:36.637 --> 33:44.072
to. trying to be this kind of a person, an astronaut 
kind of person, how they view it, what they would

33:44.845 --> 33:49.854
be. And so you can get an idea of, is this the kind of 
person you'd like being an astronaut working with

33:49.914 --> 33:55.084
you? Now, when they come in to be an astronaut, they 
have an idea of what, what it takes to do the job. We

34:03.279 --> 34:05.903
have an idea of what it takes to do the job. And, uh, 
Somehow you've got to pick a number of people that

34:09.685 --> 34:18.836
you want to work with you on doing these 
exploration jobs, these astronaut things. I

34:19.436 --> 34:21.759
don't think you end up taking the smartest people. 
You don't take the physically fit people, most

34:22.520 --> 34:27.526
physically fit people. Maybe they happen to come 
in. But what you end up taking are the people that

34:29.408 --> 34:37.077
you think that you can work with to get the job done 
the best. And I think sometimes that a lot of it just

34:37.462 --> 34:58.828
has to do with whether people that are there know 
you or know of your attitudes and know how

34:37.462 --> 34:58.828
cooperative you are and that you're a good team 
player and a lot of intangibles that make it

34:37.462 --> 34:58.828
difficult to pinpoint. All these things are sort 
of given points and you add up the points and at the

34:59.369 --> 35:04.735
end you... You take a look at the ones that have the 
highest points and you try to take them. And you may

35:10.303 --> 35:20.313
have to do some juggling because maybe the fifth 
one down is the fourth geologist you've got among

35:10.303 --> 35:20.313
the top five and you don't really need that many 
geologists. So maybe you take that person and

35:20.333 --> 35:26.398
don't take him and go below him and take someone 
else because you really need an astronomer. And so

35:27.019 --> 35:30.182
maybe take the highest ranking astronomer who 
could be further down. So there's a lot of... give

35:33.200 --> 35:58.313
and take and a lot of it just boils down to is this the 
kind of person i'd like to work with and and that's

35:33.200 --> 35:58.313
true not only astronaut corps but it's true in 
every walk of life a lot of what you get in life has to

35:33.200 --> 35:58.313
do with how people perceive you as being 
cooperative or like them or you'd fit in and they

35:33.200 --> 35:58.313
can't they can't know either i mean they don't know 
how you're really going to fit in and uh That's how

36:00.318 --> 36:05.164
the selection... And when women were taken, it was 
the same thing exactly. I mean, they couldn't run

36:06.126 --> 36:07.868
as far maybe. Some could run further than the guys, 
but same kind of thing. And so there was really not a

36:12.434 --> 36:15.018
lot of changes for the women. So it's mostly 
attitude then, just selecting. I think it's a lot.

36:20.605 --> 36:29.717
Yeah, I think that if you had to... As long as you... 
You can't be physically...

36:30.997 --> 36:34.763
If you're physically bad, no matter what your 
attitude is, you've had it. If you're

36:36.105 --> 36:39.891
professionally incompetent, no matter what your 
attitude is, you've had it. But there's many more

36:39.911 --> 36:43.316
people that have those two than you can ever take. 
So I think the thing you can hope to do... is if you

36:47.062 --> 36:53.128
have those two, which many do, then it's mostly 
attitude, and I've found that to be true in life,

36:47.062 --> 36:53.128
period. I mean, it's the attitude of the people 
that really make the difference, and it's funny,

36:53.568 --> 37:05.741
at least my experience has been looking at 
successful people, they all kind of have the same

36:53.568 --> 37:05.741
attitude, most of them. You'll find an unusual one 
now and then that's pretty weird, but mostly they

37:05.761 --> 37:14.149
have good attitudes, and... Even if they might not 
have a good attitude to people outside their field

37:15.142 --> 37:24.474
or somebody that's not working with them, to the 
people they work with, they have a good attitude.

37:24.534 --> 37:26.917
Because good people wouldn't work with them if 
they didn't. Because they don't want to be around

37:26.937 --> 37:30.481
people that aren't nice. I wouldn't. If I was 
around somebody I didn't like very quickly, I'd

37:32.704 --> 37:38.691
say, hey, I've got to go somewhere, and I'd just go. 
I wouldn't want to be around them. And that is the

37:41.154 --> 37:44.338
case there, too. That's the number one thing to 
work on, I think. It's hard to do, but it's

37:47.793 --> 37:52.639
profitable if you can do it. Wouldn't you say that? 
Now, this is a dog with a good attitude. See this

37:56.985 --> 37:57.606
attitude? Sweet doggy. It seems to me that NASA 
falls into the realms of science, but until

37:59.828 --> 38:09.561
recently, scientists really weren't accepted 
into the program. Why would you say that that is?

38:14.407 --> 38:19.293
Well, I think that was because they began with no 
scientists. And the group that was

38:20.414 --> 38:27.823
in control were non-scientists. And so they were 
more familiar with non-scientists, pilots. And

38:34.432 --> 38:43.823
so naturally they felt more comfortable and felt 
one of the rules of life is people tend to like

38:34.432 --> 38:43.823
people like themselves. I mean, a banker may not be 
as crazy about other bankers, but he's

38:44.073 --> 38:50.839
comfortable with them. And if he runs into a person 
that likes the same kind of thing he does and works

38:51.379 --> 39:04.031
about as hard as he does and all that, they tend to 
like that person and feel that person is good. So

39:05.072 --> 39:09.676
I think that was the case. If NASA had started out 
with a bunch of scientists... then pilots would

39:13.148 --> 39:24.783
have had difficulty because scientists would 
have viewed pilots as flighty or hot shot. Whereas

39:26.025 --> 39:35.978
maybe pilots viewed scientists as studious,

39:26.025 --> 39:35.978
not loose enough. I don't know what, but I mean, 
It's normal. It's just like Americans view

39:39.021 --> 39:41.783
Frenchmen as. Frenchmen view Americans as. And we 
all know that there's just as many Frenchmen just

39:44.205 --> 39:50.791
like us as there are Americans. So it's just the way 
it is, and it's gradually changing, see, because

39:50.831 --> 39:58.898
we got some early scientists in, your father, for 
example. He had to kind of break the ice. Now, you

40:04.342 --> 40:07.405
know, the scientists... People don't think of 
them quite so different as they did before. It's

40:13.945 --> 40:15.787
just part of life, you know. I mean, if you go on a 
football team and everybody's 6'3", and you're

40:15.807 --> 40:22.635
5'10", you're different. And if you go on another 
team where everybody's 5'10", and you're 6'3",

40:22.655 --> 40:27.981
you're different, and you're going to have 
trouble fitting in. It's just the way of human

40:29.282 --> 40:31.485
nature. Okay, NASA's civilian organization, how 
has its role drifted towards the military in

40:33.153 --> 40:43.224
recent years? Well, I don't really think NASA's 
role has drifted towards the military. What has

40:49.090 --> 40:52.814
occurred is the military is going to use the 
shuttle. So NASA's off here trying to get money so

40:53.755 --> 40:57.419
they can build the shuttle. And so in order to get 
money from the Air Force or the military, they've

41:00.406 --> 41:05.097
got to satisfy their requirements. So they have to 
go with them and say, in order to give us money for

41:05.117 --> 41:11.171
the shuttle, what has it got to do? And the military 
says, well, it's got to fly this far across range.

41:14.659 --> 41:16.643
It's got to carry this much load and this and that. 
And NASA would try to talk them out of it if it was

41:17.180 --> 41:20.744
different from their own goals. If they couldn't, 
they'd then accept it. But I don't think... I can't

41:24.308 --> 41:26.050
tell NASA's any more... I don't think NASA's any 
more military. Don't forget the heads of NASA are

41:28.012 --> 41:31.115
not military at all, generally. So they don't want 
to be military. They don't... Once again, they...

41:35.400 --> 41:35.800
They want... They like civilians. They like them. 
Now, there's a few military sprinkled around, and

41:37.502 --> 41:40.425
they like them. But if those military people don't 
act pretty much like civilians, they're going to

41:40.445 --> 41:45.711
remove them and put civilians in. So... I haven't 
seen NASA move to a more military way. It may be, and

41:52.489 --> 41:54.372
I just don't notice it. I think even if you're here a 
while as a military, very soon you become a

41:54.392 --> 42:00.842
civilian. I was there 18 years, and I felt I wasn't 
military after two or three years. I just didn't do

42:05.950 --> 42:09.816
military things. Let's

42:11.281 --> 42:16.947
get Rush into this now. How did Rush's 
accomplishments in the early 60s affect our

42:16.967 --> 42:31.963
astronauts' attitudes and determination to make 
our program be successful?

42:31.983 --> 42:32.404
I don't know. I guess it affected just like it did 
everybody else. We wanted to be the best country in

42:36.108 --> 42:40.933
the world, so we worked at it. I don't think, I think 
the astronauts would have felt that way anyway. I

42:46.968 --> 42:50.174
think those sorts of things have more of a public 
opinion. I never wanted to do anything because the

42:50.715 --> 42:53.561
Russians did. I mean, I never felt as an astronaut. 
I never in training or in flying a mission ever

42:57.749 --> 43:02.719
thought to myself, I got to do a little bit better 
because Russians are trying. I mean, I'm sure that

43:07.061 --> 43:12.931
football players say, I got to do better because 
the opposing team, you know. But Russians, you

43:13.852 --> 43:19.222
never see them and you don't really know that 
you're competing and they're far away. So you

43:19.302 --> 43:21.906
really... You really don't know. I don't think it 
had any attitude on astronauts. I think it had a

43:28.818 --> 43:34.205
heck of an effect on presidents and Congress and 
people, general people. Well, it's not that

43:35.587 --> 43:45.282
important, but we did try to assess their program 
and its progress. How accurate do you think the

43:45.462 --> 43:51.150
intelligence that we got was in the 60s of their 
program? I think it was probably pretty good. I

43:54.842 --> 44:04.698
think it was good enough so that we realized that we 
better get off our duffs and get into space. I think

44:05.559 --> 44:18.960
the one thing that I remember that had to do with the 
Russians was back in the end of 1969, intelligence

44:05.559 --> 44:18.960
said that they were gonna send a Soyuz spacecraft 
around the moon. Not orbit it, but just go around it

44:21.269 --> 44:23.692
once and back. And when that occurred, people at 
NASA got a big idea to get Apollo 8 out to the moon

44:25.034 --> 44:33.324
before they did. But that wasn't astronauts. 
Astronauts didn't even know it was. I remember

44:37.248 --> 44:39.010
when they told us they were going to do it. I mean, it 
just was a big surprise. We weren't even thinking

44:40.612 --> 44:41.574
about it. We were over-training. And the crew that 
went over and did it, Frank Borman's crew, they

44:42.895 --> 44:48.542
were training astronauts. They were training 
behind us. And

44:52.026 --> 44:58.513
when we heard they were going to fly before us, that 
was kind of disappointing. But, you know, we were

44:58.553 --> 45:04.318
so busy training, it really didn't make us any 
difference at all. We just said, gosh, wonder why.

45:09.343 --> 45:11.646
It was only later on we heard the Russians might do 
it. And then we hoped to beat the Russians, but, you

45:12.486 --> 45:17.191
know, we didn't. There's nothing we could do. 
Thank you.
