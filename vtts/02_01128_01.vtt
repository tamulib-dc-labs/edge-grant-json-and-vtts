00:03.338 --> 00:21.814
My

00:03.338 --> 00:21.814
name

00:03.338 --> 00:21.814
is Larry Probst. I am a retired president of Betz 
Processed Chemicals here in the Woodlands. I

00:27.599 --> 00:32.383
think one of the things that you are trying to 
determine is how Betz and the probes family

00:32.583 --> 01:00.126
specifically got here to the woodlands let me back 
up just a little bit on my own personal history i was

00:32.583 --> 01:00.126
a 1950 graduate of villanova university as a 
chemical engineer and in june of 1950 i had a

00:32.583 --> 01:00.126
extremely interesting two weeks the 3rd of june my 
first son was born the 7th was my first wedding

01:01.118 --> 01:02.960
anniversary. The fifth, I graduated from 
Villanova. And the 12th, I went to work for Betts

01:05.703 --> 01:08.827
Laboratories.

01:12.391 --> 01:24.825
Since that time, I've had several 
responsibilities at Betts, moving through the

01:12.391 --> 01:24.825
engineering chairs to eventually become vice 
president of their engineering force. And I also

01:26.307 --> 01:30.231
became a director in 1975 But in the latter part of 
1977, Betts, which is a worldwide water and oil

01:31.426 --> 01:54.953
treating company, made the decision that they 
would have to move some of their analytical and

01:31.426 --> 01:54.953
research facilities from the Tribos area, which 
is a suburb just north of the city of Philadelphia,

01:56.367 --> 02:24.298
and we chose to go somewhere in the south and since 
houston was the epicenter as we say of our business

01:56.367 --> 02:24.298
in this particular area it seemed quite natural to 
begin to look for space in this houston area

01:56.367 --> 02:24.298
i happen to be personally familiar with the 
woodlands having come here as an officer of bets

02:24.447 --> 02:34.701
and the head of some of the units where we wanted to 
have regional meetings in this particular

02:24.447 --> 02:34.701
section. And prior to coming to the Woodlands, we 
had been to places like April Sound and some others

02:34.862 --> 02:46.257
that I don't really recall right now in this area. 
So when the Woodlands finally opened up their

02:46.278 --> 02:50.944
conference center, we came very early in the game 
in the 76 77 period so when we decided in the

02:51.599 --> 03:20.020
november of 1977 to move south it was easy for me to 
think of the woodlands as a good place to locate my

02:51.599 --> 03:20.020
family

02:51.599 --> 03:20.020
one of the reasons why i felt comfortable in the 
woodlands bringing my wife and 16-year-old

03:20.354 --> 03:25.819
daughter was the fact that my son, Thomas, already 
lived here. He was a contract painter working for

03:25.859 --> 03:40.374
some of our original builders here, such as Tom Cox 
and Jim O'Connor, and some of the others that may

03:25.859 --> 03:40.374
not necessarily still be building here. But 
anyhow, Tom and his wife, Sue, had moved here in the

03:41.735 --> 03:47.661
latter 76.

03:49.733 --> 04:08.194
So knowing that I would have to do a good bit of 
traveling and not wanting my wife and daughter to

03:49.733 --> 04:08.194
feel too alone, I thought that the Woodlands would 
be an excellent place for them to be living with the

03:49.733 --> 04:08.194
closeness of Tom and his family.

04:12.419 --> 04:15.302
After we decided where we would locate, We then 
began to look around the Houston area for a

04:16.717 --> 04:24.788
suitable spot of 15 or 20 acres of land. And we 
realized that in order to have a campus-like

04:26.671 --> 04:44.054
atmosphere, similar to the ones we had in the 
Philadelphia area, we couldn't locate in areas

04:26.671 --> 04:44.054
like Rankin Road or off of 45 or off of 59. So we 
shopped. and finally settled on the two places

04:47.159 --> 04:56.672
where we could locate Kingwood and the Woodlands. 
One of the things you mentioned earlier, which I

04:56.752 --> 05:05.565
thought might be significant, is the issue of the 
covenant. That's what I was getting to. The

05:09.410 --> 05:14.517
Kingwood area and the Woodlands area both gave us 
easy access to the international airport. And

05:21.995 --> 05:33.026
since I personally had already decided and made 
commitments to build a house, I was leaning

05:21.995 --> 05:33.026
towards the woodlands. But one of the other 
executives of bets was responsible for picking

05:33.046 --> 05:38.131
the location. And coincidentally, he ended up 
coming here with one of the early

05:45.648 --> 05:57.963
real estate persons, and I can't recall his name 
right offhand.

06:00.466 --> 06:13.242
But after he looked the two places over, he felt 
that the Woodlands was a better location and

06:00.466 --> 06:13.242
proceeded to spend about a half an hour on the 
telephone convincing me halfway across the

06:15.061 --> 06:20.248
country that this was a good spot. We both realized 
that the restrictive covenants that the

06:20.268 --> 06:34.706
Woodlands had was one of the main features for our 
laboratory and research and headquarters for the

06:20.268 --> 06:34.706
Betz Process Chemical Company.

06:38.211 --> 06:42.216
I think those features are probably the main 
reasons why we located here in addition to the

06:43.900 --> 07:11.460
general quality of this area as compared to living

06:43.900 --> 07:11.460
in the champions area or naturally any of us that 
wanted to be part of the vets campus and our homes if

06:43.900 --> 07:11.460
we could do them in the same area why It would be far 
better for us than doing like we just did in

07:12.352 --> 07:20.161
Philadelphia, drive 15 to 20 miles every day to 
work. You actually discussed that on the phone

07:20.742 --> 07:28.271
then, the advantages of being able to live in the 
area where you were working. Well, that was one of

07:28.291 --> 07:34.719
the main things that we used to sell the other 
people that we were bringing from other parts of

07:28.291 --> 07:34.719
the country. We brought research and laboratory 
people from Philadelphia, but we brought

07:35.320 --> 07:42.088
salesmen, managers, and other high-tech people 
from other parts of the United States, such as

07:42.338 --> 07:55.190
California, Chicago area, some in the central 
Midwest, in St. Louis, Denver. There were perhaps

07:56.491 --> 08:08.683
25 people that were the original cadre of the vets 
group here.

08:09.068 --> 08:31.448
we made arrangements with the woodlands and 
bought 20 acres in the location that we are now and

08:09.068 --> 08:31.448
after we did that we of course cleared the land and 
built our first 40 000 square foot building in the

08:09.068 --> 08:31.448
shape of a t with the top half of the t the 
headquarters for That's Process Chemical

08:32.626 --> 08:39.634
Company, and then the bottom half were the 
Analytical Laboratory and the research.

08:40.695 --> 08:59.157
Subsequent to that, we built about another 55,000 
square feet of research space as we expanded about

08:40.695 --> 08:59.157
two years after opening there in 1980.

09:01.516 --> 09:11.489
recommended to people as they were considered to 
transfer from Philadelphia to the woodlands

09:01.516 --> 09:11.489
operation. It was relatively easy to convince 
them to

09:12.851 --> 09:27.591
come to the south in addition to the good climate 
compared to all the snow digging that we had to do.

09:30.389 --> 09:59.687
wonderful area of the woodlands and the new 
hometown program and everything else the growth

09:30.389 --> 09:59.687
pattern the hike and bike trails i often say that 
coming here at 52 i regret i didn't come here at the

09:30.389 --> 09:59.687
age of 32 and raise my family here rather than 
having most all of them out of high school by the

09:30.389 --> 09:59.687
time i got here because all of the younger 
generation of feds that has come here used to

10:01.540 --> 10:19.461
always go back to Philadelphia and tell the people 
back there that it was like a constant vacation

10:01.540 --> 10:19.461
while they lived in the woodlands with all of the 
programs that we had here for the children, with

10:01.540 --> 10:19.461
the swimming pools and the facilities that we had. 
And of course, when we came here, there were only

10:19.481 --> 10:24.907
3,000 people and no red lights. Now we have about 
30,000 and a lot of red lights. We only had the

10:30.413 --> 10:53.110
original village of Grogan's Mill at the time, and 
only the two golf courses, but a lot of tennis

10:30.413 --> 10:53.110
courts and a lot of opportunities for

10:30.413 --> 10:53.110
all ages of people.

10:53.130 --> 10:53.511
That's fine. One of the things, has Betts been in a 
growth mode since you came? Have new staff members

10:59.982 --> 11:06.628
or researchers come since then? Has that initial 
sense of enamor with the woodlands maintained

11:06.688 --> 11:14.454
itself through? I would say so, yes, because we've 
had people come here almost on a continuous basis

11:14.474 --> 11:26.965
for the first seven or eight years, from 1978 until 
about the past two years. where we would bring

11:28.531 --> 11:34.358
different units of best research, maybe just four 
or five people. And then another year would pass,

11:36.201 --> 11:40.266
and we'd bring four or five more and maybe hire 
some. Most of the technicians are hired locally.

11:44.551 --> 11:50.218
Most of the research managers have transferred 
from Philadelphia or from some other part of the

11:44.551 --> 11:50.218
country. But I know that when they were hiring 
people to come here,

11:58.653 --> 12:13.231
to identify and show them all the advantages that 
we had here at the Woodlands helped a lot of people

11:58.653 --> 12:13.231
to make up their mind to move from other parts that 
were not quite as enjoyable to live and work. One

12:13.251 --> 12:21.000
thing in the very early stages, we all talked about 
having the University of Houston campus here. And

12:23.163 --> 12:26.787
that brought a few people. to this area to help 
increase their education. And that did not

12:31.079 --> 12:38.366
develop into an active program. They since have 
gone to some of the other local schools in order to

12:39.007 --> 12:47.096
get their extra degrees.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.162
How active was the Woodmans itself? in helping you 
as a director locate these people here? Did they

13:02.297 --> 13:04.699
play a role, a significant role? Were they 
supportive? I would say that not only the

13:05.380 --> 13:17.590
Woodlands people, but also some of the other 
Houston area groups that helped people transfer

13:05.380 --> 13:17.590
from other parts of the country to this particular 
area. There were a lot of real estate and

13:23.990 --> 13:27.434
development people that had units. I think one of 
them at the time was called the Woodlands

13:27.474 --> 13:33.081
Development Council or something like that. I 
really don't remember. But there were several

13:35.964 --> 13:41.270
different people that I remember helped us. One of 
the original men that's still here is a chap by the

13:41.931 --> 13:53.625
name of Rex Johnson, who was primarily 
responsible for us finally deciding on where we

13:41.931 --> 13:53.625
located and the exact acreage that we picked, 
because we had two or three choices. None of this

14:01.273 --> 14:04.917
area north of Timberlock was developed at that 
time. So we had to literally build the roads to get

14:05.137 --> 14:08.721
to our location. So it was a little difficult to 
visualize what it was going to be like. And of

14:15.949 --> 14:19.613
course, with other people like Richard Brown

14:21.652 --> 14:25.857
Ed Lee, who was the original president.

14:30.823 --> 14:34.187
Those are just some of the few people that I can 
remember at the beginning.

14:42.997 --> 14:50.646
Let

14:42.997 --> 14:50.646
me just say one more thing about our family. 
indicate how totally convenient it is to live in

14:51.503 --> 15:21.510
the woodlands in my opinion we had of course as i 
said earlier our son thomas lived here before we

14:51.503 --> 15:21.510
came and when my wife and my daughter gina came down 
in 78 then within two years after that my son

14:51.503 --> 15:21.510
michael joined us and stayed with us for about a 
year and then married and now he lives here so i have

14:51.503 --> 15:21.510
one of the A few people with three generations, two 
sons and three grandchildren. This really is a

15:28.134 --> 15:29.175
hometown. And this is obvious. And when people ask 
me if I were going back to Philadelphia when I

15:30.737 --> 15:50.061
retired this year from Betts after 40-plus years, 
having passed the retirement age of 65, I was

15:30.737 --> 15:50.061
asked, oh, I'm sure you and your wife will return to 
Philly. And the answer was no. very simply, no,

15:52.388 --> 16:09.111
there's no reason that we should ever consider 
going back to Philly because we have our two sons

15:52.388 --> 16:09.111
and three grandchildren here, and we have our 
daughter and her husband living in Austin after

15:52.388 --> 16:09.111
she subsequently went to University of Texas and 
graduated from there. So they're living in

16:10.433 --> 16:20.927
Austin, and now they're expecting a baby, so the 
remaining, our oldest boy and his two children and

16:10.433 --> 16:20.927
his wife live in San Francisco area in Black Hawk, 
south of Walnut Creek. And we just came back from

16:28.047 --> 16:29.569
there. And since my wife and I do travel a lot, we had 
no problem going out to California. I returned to

16:38.022 --> 16:48.518
Philadelphia about every month or nine or 10 times 
a year for our vets board meetings. So I'll

16:49.443 --> 16:52.447
continue to do that until April of 92.

16:56.172 --> 17:14.877
And to then talk about the pavilion, one of the 
other responsibilities that I had here or one of

16:56.172 --> 17:14.877
the avocations early was a member of the board of 
directors of the original bank in the Woodlands,

16:56.172 --> 17:14.877
which eventually became M Bank of Woodlands. And 
it's now Bank One, but when the Bank One people took

17:15.818 --> 17:24.810
over MBank, well, they dissolved all of the 
boards, so you no longer have a board. But I think

17:26.172 --> 17:36.967
the opportunity to work in the community, and of 
course I also am the head of the Finance Committee

17:26.172 --> 17:36.967
of St. Simon and Jude Catholic Church. It seems to 
me that some of the older and earlier people here

17:38.429 --> 17:44.037
were assigned some of the... responsibilities 
from the different organizations and churches,

17:45.265 --> 17:55.995
so I'm sure that's why I ended up doing some of the 
other than vets business. And I'm also a member of

17:58.217 --> 18:08.747
the Houston Golf Association, so I've got many 
things to keep me busy in my retirement. And one of

18:08.768 --> 18:14.513
the opportunities I was given towards the end of 
well, I should say in the early part of 1990, was the

18:16.636 --> 18:30.534
opportunity to be on the board of the Pavilion, 
Cynthia Woods Mitchell Pavilion for the

18:16.636 --> 18:30.534
Performing Arts. Some people have indicated that 
I got the job because the Betz parking lot was right

18:32.056 --> 18:40.968
near the pavilion, but I don't like to think that 
was the whole reason. But having known the

18:45.037 --> 18:50.742
Mitchells as well as the other people in the 
hierarchy of the Mitchell organization. I'm sure

18:52.544 --> 19:01.753
that my name was one of the ones on the list of 
candidates for the board members. And that gave me

19:03.654 --> 19:12.883
an opportunity to, again, have something else to 
work with during my retirement. I think that the

19:14.804 --> 19:24.579
pavilion is probably going to be one of the nicest

19:14.804 --> 19:24.579
units of the woodlands. We've only completed one 
year, but we have a lot of plans for 1991 to increase

19:25.981 --> 19:33.893
the number of programs. And I'm sure that the 
opportunity to provide more cultural

19:44.723 --> 19:52.314
involvements for the people in the Woodlands will 
make this hometown a bigger and even better

19:44.723 --> 19:52.314
hometown. Do you have a sense of how many people 
from the Woodlands have attended

19:53.956 --> 20:08.838
program versus how many from surrounding

19:53.956 --> 20:08.838
communities? No, they've taken surveys of the 
people that have come to the programs but i think

20:13.529 --> 20:43.317
it's very difficult i know from talking to many of 
my friends in the

20:13.529 --> 20:43.317
woodlands that all of the industries have sent 
people from their

20:13.529 --> 20:43.317
companies as part of perks for their own employees 
for example at vets we had a box and also we had four

20:13.529 --> 20:43.317
reserve seats And if we did not have customers that 
were able to come and join up with us at any of the

20:44.410 --> 20:58.707
performances, why, we would then turn the tickets 
over to our employees and their families so that

20:59.918 --> 21:03.142
Was that a bed suggestion or did that come from 
folks in the woodlands? No, that was our own

21:03.222 --> 21:05.305
decision. But other companies are doing the same 
thing? But we know that other companies have been

21:07.228 --> 21:14.057
doing the same thing, especially those people 
that are in adjacent boxes to us. We've noticed

21:14.317 --> 21:18.523
that they've been sending their employees as well 
as their own customers. And I know from talking to

21:20.806 --> 21:29.217
the younger generation, you know, my son's 
associates, both my boys have different groups

21:29.669 --> 21:59.558
that they associate with in their sporting 
events, you know, the tennis and golf and softball

21:29.669 --> 21:59.558
and, of course, all of the younger generation with 
the soccer teams and the independent football and

21:29.669 --> 21:59.558
baseball, little league, all of those fathers 
that are one generation away from me, they all have

21:29.669 --> 21:59.558
these opportunities in the Woodlands to be 
involved in all these athletic events. And now I

22:02.695 --> 22:07.099
even have some of my grandchildren getting 
involved in those. But getting back to the

22:07.119 --> 22:17.609
pavilion, I know that there are a lot of people that 
have sent the younger folks to the pavilion. A lot

22:17.669 --> 22:22.753
of them have gone on their own to the various 
performances that we've had. Because my

22:23.694 --> 22:27.638
generation doesn't really know all of those 
performances. But my son's generation knew them

22:28.394 --> 22:37.025
all by heart, and they were always participating 
in the shows. What has been the philosophical or

22:37.666 --> 22:48.039
the values that the board has utilized or seen 
demonstrated in the Pavilion? To what audience is

22:48.059 --> 22:56.190
it aiming its venue of acts? Well, I think that one 
of the things that we're trying to do right now is to

22:57.402 --> 23:06.512
focus more on the type of programs that we're going 
to have. Thirty, for example, in number for what I

23:07.913 --> 23:26.413
call the non-performing arts or the

23:07.913 --> 23:26.413
musical units, such as Crosby, Stills, and Nash, 
you know, those, however you define those,

23:07.913 --> 23:26.413
whether it's rock or concert or whatever, and then 
we're going to have twenty or more of the cultural

23:26.950 --> 23:41.229
things such as the ballet and the symphony and

23:26.950 --> 23:41.229
that type. So I would say that we're trying to focus 
on every generation and every type of cultural

23:50.828 --> 23:55.033
program that most anybody would be interested in. 
So is it abroad? You're trying to get all

23:56.254 --> 23:58.056
generations. Obviously you can get the older 
people with some of the pop arts. Last year when you

24:01.981 --> 24:06.066
had Frank Sinatra and some of those older people. 
The Woodlands does not have a high percentage of

24:06.666 --> 24:11.472
over 50. Because every company that came here had 
maybe a manager over 50 and then several 40 year

24:12.333 --> 24:18.640
olds. So we don't have a standard town of age 
brackets because we are almost in a pyramid form

24:22.402 --> 24:50.586
with a few olders and then a few more in the 40s and a 
lot more in the 30s and a tremendous number in the

24:22.402 --> 24:50.586
20s so the people that move here with companies 
normally came in in that type of as i call it pyramid

24:22.402 --> 24:50.586
form but there have been a number of people that 
have moved here for retirement that I'm familiar

24:51.359 --> 24:55.226
with from my older golf partners. They had 40 or 
50-year-old children here that came as part of a

24:55.867 --> 25:02.839
company. So then when they came here and visited, 
they found what a nice place it was to locate. And if

25:09.610 --> 25:17.063
you can get through July and August in the summer, 
most Yankees can stand the South. And so I know

25:18.528 --> 25:22.294
quite a few people that have retired here. Paul 
Womack said he doesn't even go on vacations

25:22.895 --> 25:25.919
anymore. He can't think of any place he wants to go. 
Everything that he wants to do is right here. While

25:32.629 --> 25:37.076
that may be a little bit extreme, I think it's 
illustrative of what you're saying. It's a

25:37.096 --> 25:38.538
pleasant place for people. Well, we used to laugh 
about people who came down here of our original

25:39.159 --> 25:45.328
group back in 78. when they would go back to 
Philadelphia to visit their relatives at

25:46.017 --> 25:59.030
Christmas time or weddings or whatever, the 
comment was always made that living in the

25:46.017 --> 25:59.030
woodlands was like being on a constant vacation. 
And more than one family expressed that back to our

26:00.812 --> 26:05.817
Philadelphia people. So the statement was made in 
our internal group at Betts that Maybe those folks

26:12.376 --> 26:15.942
down in the woodlands are really not working as 
hard as they should be. Everybody

26:16.003 --> 26:21.192
always came back. Everybody came back north with a 
good suntan. And one hand is always more tan than

26:25.840 --> 26:32.973
the other from the golf gloves.

26:33.033 --> 26:36.139
So the snow diggers... always did envious and then 
of course when they used to come down here for we had

26:37.233 --> 27:04.050
quarterly meetings of our executive staff that 
came here uh maybe a group of anywhere from six to

26:37.233 --> 27:04.050
ten people including our chief financial officer 
our chief legal officer the chairman the

26:37.233 --> 27:04.050
president and several others ahead of our 
research department those people came and

27:04.283 --> 27:31.033
reviewed with us our work program for our vets 
process company and our vets energy company in

27:04.283 --> 27:31.033
california secondary recovery work and when they 
would come they would stay two or three days and

27:04.283 --> 27:31.033
naturally they were very impressed number one 
with the woodlands in with the facilities that we

27:04.283 --> 27:31.033
had here the glass menagerie for our big formal 
suppers uh places like the feed store or quick

27:31.756 --> 28:00.008
barbecue lunches and heidens for the seafood we 
always seem to have so many things around here that

27:31.756 --> 28:00.008
we could take everybody to and i've always made the 
statement that the beauty of the woodlands is that

27:31.756 --> 28:00.008
everything is five minutes away you can go to 
church you can go to the barbers you can get your

27:31.756 --> 28:00.008
shoes fixed you can get your cleaning post office a 
reasonable number of small shops for your wife.

28:07.367 --> 28:13.076
And the vets and the doctors and just everything 
that you need is all done. We who lived in

28:13.977 --> 28:30.703
Philadelphia had to travel anywhere from 30 to 45 
or 60 minutes to get to the pediatrician, to get to

28:13.977 --> 28:30.703
the hospital that you prefer to have your children 
at,

28:32.438 --> 28:44.556
Facilities for, obviously, any kind of a cultural 
facility had to be cleared downtown in

28:32.438 --> 28:44.556
Philadelphia to get to the airport within an hour. 
And whenever it snowed, then it was twice that. And

28:48.402 --> 29:02.142
our offices were anywhere from 30 to 60 minutes 
away, depending upon the weather, so that the

28:48.402 --> 29:02.142
ability to do everything in five minutes It's just 
a miracle, as far as I'm concerned, from a work and a

29:03.286 --> 29:11.353
living standpoint. That was my big theme all the 
years I've been here, that everything is five

29:11.373 --> 29:16.277
minutes away. That's a good testimonial of what 
Mr. Mitchell was trying to do. One last question,

29:19.760 --> 29:25.005
because I haven't had anybody else to ask this, and 
you brought it to my mind since you're obviously an

29:19.760 --> 29:25.005
avid golfer. Tell me about golf in the Woodlands. 
Are they got four courses now? When we came, the

29:34.876 --> 30:00.748
original course that was wrapped around the 
conference center was known as the west course and

29:34.876 --> 30:00.748
the east course was just being completed in 78 and 
that's the one that's now the tournament players

29:34.876 --> 30:00.748
course where they had the houston open they had the 
houston open for a few years on the west course and

29:34.876 --> 30:00.748
eventually the west was added to in two areas nine 
more holes added to the original and first the left

30:01.893 --> 30:30.043
side and then the right side or the north side i 
guess you'd call it over in panther creek and that

30:01.893 --> 30:30.043
became the north golf course and then of course the 
west new nine holes were over in the grogan's mill

30:01.893 --> 30:30.043
area

30:01.893 --> 30:30.043
grogan's point rather than grogan's mill then the 
fourth course is the arnold palmer course which is

30:30.783 --> 30:35.110
way out on the west side in one of the other 
villages. See, when we came here, the original

30:35.450 --> 30:51.054
concept was something like six or seven 
individual villages, all with separate

30:35.450 --> 30:51.054
shopping, separate living, separate 
everything, separate intermediate schools. And

30:52.797 --> 30:57.043
the first one was the only one that existed in 78, 
that's Grogan's Mill. Now they have the ones in

30:57.817 --> 31:01.423
Panther Creek and Cochran's Crossing. And I 
forget right now. The newer ones over on the other

31:10.540 --> 31:14.406
side. And of course, the lake was built way after. 
And the reason we selected our location right

31:22.859 --> 31:28.227
there on the corner of Brogan's Mill and what will 
eventually be Lake Woodlands Drive. We will be on

31:29.068 --> 31:31.252
one of the major intersections.

31:34.797 --> 31:44.972
And I'll never forget one of the chairman's 
concerns was that we were located too close to the

31:34.797 --> 31:44.972
fire house and the police station. He said you may 
eventually end up with so much noise that it may not

31:44.992 --> 31:50.200
be a good spot. But with the way everything is built 
in the woodlands, with the

31:50.888 --> 32:07.849
trees and the setback theory of buildings, it's 
never been a problem. Surely you can hear it, but

32:07.869 --> 32:11.714
it's never been that much of a problem. So it's not 
an annoyance. The insulation of all the trees and

32:12.896 --> 32:18.803
the and so forth really makes it It's a great place. 
Well, is there anything I should ask you to have it?

32:29.726 --> 32:31.611
I can't think of anything right now.
