WEBVTT

00:01.533 --> 00:07.280
My mother was born

00:01.533 --> 00:07.280
in Des Moines, Iowa. I shouldn't give

00:08.221 --> 00:15.711
you the date, but it was May 12, 1907. My mother was 
born in 1907. And then, I'll skip it, I went to Iowa

00:18.654 --> 00:28.006
State, took chemical engineering, and 
graduated. When you got to Iowa State, in uh 1927 or

00:31.553 --> 00:56.447
something like that 25 uh was was the chemical 
engineering department independent or with

00:31.553 --> 00:56.447
chemistry or do you remember okay it was 
independent it had done well it had become

00:31.553 --> 00:56.447
independent before i was there okay the head of 
department

00:31.553 --> 00:56.447
uh dr o.r sweeney was

00:59.853 --> 01:00.634
quite a person. He looked like Edison. He looked 
impeccable. And he had

01:06.782 --> 01:11.909
separated. We had a separate building. We did use 
some of the chemistry department basement. and

01:20.305 --> 01:28.539
they were in the chemistry department basement 
for a couple of years, several years before I was

01:20.305 --> 01:28.539
there, and they were in the chemistry department 
before they got to Quillip. Yeah. And, uh, they,

01:29.320 --> 01:42.181
uh, well... What were chem, chemical engineers in 
Iowa doing at that time when you were in school?

01:42.241 --> 01:46.448
Well, they, they didn't, they went, a lot of them 
went out of Iowa, but The companies that hired them

01:46.850 --> 01:58.162
were Quaker Oats, and there were a few other 
industries that hired them in Iowa. I just

01:59.183 --> 02:03.047
wondered, they got a food processing oriented in 
Iowa? Yes. He was interested in solid extraction.

02:12.989 --> 02:13.430
Milling? Mainly, before that, he was interested 
in paper making using straw and corn stalks. Okay,

02:23.282 --> 02:25.044
yeah. And they built, as part of his research, they 
built a plant to make wallboard, fiberboard out of

02:25.064 --> 02:39.081
corn stalks. And also, a solvent extraction plant 
was built to extract the oil, soybean oil. And both

02:48.851 --> 02:54.738
of them stopped economics. The 29 Depression made 
paper so cheap that they couldn't afford to make

02:55.178 --> 03:07.092
this all the way out of lunchbox. So they made it out 
of And then the solvent extraction plant, they had

03:09.098 --> 03:29.921
planned

03:09.098 --> 03:29.921
to use ethylene bicarbide as a solvent, and it 
turned out to be bad. The poisoned cattle, the

03:29.941 --> 03:37.570
original and the

03:29.941 --> 03:37.570
poisoned indigo paddlers had restoration. that 
plant shut down. Then there were... Do you have an

03:40.098 --> 03:44.642
interesting idea in the paper making? I don't 
guess that's done anywhere now. Is it out of corn

03:46.344 --> 03:53.792
stalk material?

03:53.812 --> 03:57.737
I don't think they used corn stalks much. They 
couldn't?

04:02.802 --> 04:05.565
Well, they had then when I was there, they had a 
Department of Agricultural Research lab there,

04:06.187 --> 04:13.818
too, as part of it. And they experimented with 
fermentation of corn stalks and

04:14.659 --> 04:28.459
other things, and distillation. They ran that at a 
big still, and they ran I dumped in there and got

04:31.229 --> 04:38.320
charcoal out and residues and stuff. What had 
gotten you interested in chemical engineering in

04:38.340 --> 04:41.505
the first place, do you know? No, I don't exactly. I 
was more interested in electrical engineering.

04:49.237 --> 04:59.312
And I got to talking with someone who said that 
chemical engineering would have a bigger field.

04:59.967 --> 05:01.408
So I just switched over. That's the way we do 
things.

05:08.796 --> 05:10.177
So you finished then? I finished my BS in 29. And

05:15.642 --> 05:23.950
that was as the depression was starting and it was 
hard to get a job. So I got a job as a chemist at the Des

05:25.152 --> 05:28.675
Moines Water Company. I spent a year there, but it 
was not chemical engineering, it was mostly

05:29.093 --> 05:40.790
chemistry. So I went back up to Iowa State and Dr. 
Sweeney offered me a graduate assistant in

05:40.810 --> 05:50.764
teaching.

05:53.157 --> 05:58.023
I was going to get out with a master's degree, but it 
was still very, very bad. No jobs available. And so

06:00.105 --> 06:02.007
I stayed on and got my PhD. Oh, you did? OK. And I will 
stay. And taught. And taught part-time. Yeah, I

06:09.055 --> 06:09.916
taught all four years. Assistive teaching, 
mostly in laboratory. And I assisted Dr. Sweeney

06:12.119 --> 06:19.207
in his first book, Walker Lewis McAdams. I don't 
know whether you've ever seen it. No. That was the

06:23.330 --> 06:25.792
first real book in chemical engineering. Is that 
right? Yes. It had the unit operations. Yeah,

06:28.775 --> 06:29.416
okay. And the methods of handling it. And it was a 
very good book. Do you have a copy of that?

06:39.085 --> 06:40.326
I may not have. I'll look in the library. It's 
McAdams, Walker, and McAdams. They really

06:45.030 --> 06:49.855
initiated chemical engineering in this country. 
MIT. Okay, yes. I've seen references.

06:56.067 --> 06:59.030
I probably should look at that, because I'm 
familiar with that story. And the next one we used,

07:01.392 --> 07:05.957
I guess, was Badger and Banker. It wasn't much of

07:05.977 --> 07:10.501
a difference. I'll look at those. That's a good 
idea. A key period. So you got your PhD. What year

07:17.909 --> 07:18.870
was that? That was in 34. And that was the very 
bottom of the depression. That was the year I was

07:25.582 --> 07:28.726
born. Memorable. So I took college

07:29.567 --> 07:51.273
jobs, one of which air conditioning was coming 
along, and I got a job working with a fellow who

07:29.567 --> 07:51.273
installed air conditioning, and I contracted to

07:29.567 --> 07:51.273
install a little of it. In Des Moines? In Des 
Moines, yeah. I went to Chicago, everything in

07:54.472 --> 08:01.458
Chicago was

07:54.472 --> 08:01.458
shut down. Yeah. And I was married to my mom, got 
married in 31. And my wife had a job. She worked for

08:09.826 --> 08:14.871
an insurance

08:09.826 --> 08:14.871
company. We had a firm for that time. That's right. 
If you were employed, you were doing pretty good.

08:21.797 --> 08:21.897
Yeah. I

08:22.855 --> 08:30.005
said, if you were employed, you were doing pretty 
good. Yes, you were doing all right. And she went

08:32.788 --> 08:39.598
for an

08:32.788 --> 08:39.598
internship, automobile industry. And so in 
summer of 35,

08:48.303 --> 08:56.953
I went back up to Iowa State and he

08:48.303 --> 08:56.953
told me about this job down here. And so I wrote down 
and he sent a recommendation and I got a job offer.

09:04.481 --> 09:17.637
Now one reason they were expanding down

09:04.481 --> 09:17.637
here, the enrollment was jumping and they didn't 
have enough

09:04.481 --> 09:17.637
people to teach. So, I don't know whether it jumped 
away from Iowa State or not, but there's not much

09:18.880 --> 09:28.032
more I can say up there. My thesis there was on 
plastics,

09:28.052 --> 09:42.771
polymer. Oh, okay. So, did you take the job down 
at... I took the job down here at A&E. Okay. And you

09:49.253 --> 09:52.637
might say I've been here all ever since. In 35, fall 
of 35, I came here. Now when you came, did you go into

09:57.002 --> 10:00.005
the chemistry department? Yes, we were still a 
part of chemistry. It was under chemistry. Yeah,

10:04.610 --> 10:06.352
chemistry and chemical engineering. Yeah. And 
Hedges, C.C. Hedges. C.C. Hedges was the head of

10:08.655 --> 10:11.198
the department. But he was not a chemical 
engineer. No, yeah. And he wasn't much interested

10:13.893 --> 10:26.086
in research, and I was, and some of the other new 
people that came in were interested.

10:26.306 --> 10:35.416
And at the time, the fellow that started Timothy 
Gleason right here was called Duke Thorne, M.K.

10:35.496 --> 10:36.957
Thorne. And I really took his job.

10:42.985 --> 10:48.114
Apparently he didn't care too much about teaching 
chemistry and playing with hedges. So he went in

10:48.134 --> 10:54.545
the, I think he went in the agricultural 
experiment station. Yeah, he did. It was the

10:55.327 --> 10:56.809
cotton specialist. Yeah, he showed people how to 
make leather and all that sort of thing. But he

11:04.342 --> 11:07.508
started the chemical engineering and they had a, 
laboratory building, I guess it was a metal

11:08.399 --> 11:19.009
building, across from where the chemistry 
department is now. Right across the street was

11:19.029 --> 11:24.014
this chemical engineering laboratory. Now 
another little thing that they were interested

11:24.074 --> 11:36.527
in, and maybe through Duke Cotton, was fibers, the 
treatment of cotton fibers and wool fibers. And

11:36.547 --> 11:38.068
there was a

11:41.997 --> 11:55.596
in a

11:41.997 --> 11:55.596
separate organization which studied processing 
fibers, dyeing and cleaning and all that. And

11:56.898 --> 12:09.616
Professor Bishop, who came in just shortly after 
his partner's death, he was also interested

11:56.898 --> 12:09.616
in that. And he was from

12:14.954 --> 12:22.604
I don't

12:14.954 --> 12:22.604
know whether he was from New York or 
Massachusetts. I'll check. He was from some

12:22.945 --> 12:26.289
school up there. And he was interested in 
papermaking because that school had been

12:26.309 --> 12:36.342
sponsored greatly by paper companies. And so he 
was interested in papermaking that idea. He

12:40.708 --> 12:44.353
started some research on it. Interesting period. 
How about petroleum? Was there much? Well, yeah.

12:49.380 --> 12:50.981
Okay, don't let me rush you.

12:53.564 --> 13:08.201
Tell me about, let me back up here just a minute, 
because when you arrived at Texas A&M, what was

12:53.564 --> 13:08.201
your impression of the school and teaching the 
situation? Well, I didn't. Professor Hedges was

13:10.804 --> 13:13.007
hard to get along with. Other than that, it was 
okay. The people in there, I got along fine. We, uh,

13:19.963 --> 13:28.110
Bishop and I had our own say-so in the development 
of chemical engineering. Okay. So you two really

13:28.871 --> 13:30.332
were in it? We, we started it. I started teaching 
the courses that I had helped with and taught at

13:33.455 --> 13:39.241
Iowa State. And Bishop had the unit operations 
pretty well, too. And I started teaching

13:45.320 --> 13:51.550
the first course, 204. That was the new course.

13:57.860 --> 14:01.225
I was talking to Ron Darby the other day about it, 
and I can't remember what it is. Well, he's still

14:01.265 --> 14:02.166
teaching it. Yeah, he's teaching it now, in fact. 
We used the best book that there ever was from

14:04.069 --> 14:09.538
Haugen and Watson. And then we later resubmitted 
one that was written by the University of Texas.

14:18.960 --> 14:24.508
But Hagen and Watson was probably the best book on 
that. Physical Properties. Okay. That was the

14:27.431 --> 14:28.753
course, wasn't it? That was the course. Physical 
Properties. Yeah. Yeah.

14:34.060 --> 14:34.220
Yeah. And then I taught design from the point of 
very beginning. And my first class was 36 when I did

14:40.400 --> 14:48.171
basic. And they did very well. And I met with them 
some years back here, some of

14:51.917 --> 15:00.750
them. All of them did excellent. Now to back to 
growing. When I first came here, Everything was

15:06.353 --> 15:12.582
pointed to petroleum because they hired all of our 
students. We taught a laboratory course

15:12.602 --> 15:22.757
in petroleum and a regular class. We had a class in 
petroleum, 409 of them.

15:32.780 --> 15:41.012
But

15:32.780 --> 15:41.012
we were down in the basement. We distilled crude 
oil and even gasoline, which was very bad, down in

15:41.032 --> 15:50.865
the basement of the chemistry department. We had 
drums, big drums of crude oil down there. And it was

15:54.571 --> 15:56.934
not very safe. Luckily, we didn't blow it up. Then 
gradually,

16:03.408 --> 16:10.377
the new things came in. I might say that there was a 
Pan American Oil, Pan Am Oil Company, a subsidiary

16:10.557 --> 16:23.994
of Standard? Standard Oil, subsidiary. And all 
they did was distill petroleum. It was the largest

16:29.361 --> 16:32.605
one in the world at the time. And

16:33.547 --> 16:50.328
then gradually, they began to

16:33.547 --> 16:50.328
use petroleum byproducts as chemicals. And they 
began

16:50.348 --> 16:56.475
to make various things, like Shell. Shell

16:57.617 --> 17:02.102
developed a plant to make glycerin. They

17:03.095 --> 17:29.011
also had been making ethyl alcohol, and then of 
course they made many other chemicals, ethylene

17:03.095 --> 17:29.011
glycol. And now off the back, the first oil 
companies were Golf, an oil company in Fort

17:29.031 --> 17:30.773
Arthur. And

17:31.630 --> 17:49.827
Tim

17:31.630 --> 17:49.827
Kerr was almost as old

17:31.630 --> 17:49.827
in Fort Arthur. And then there

17:49.847 --> 17:57.214
was what's called the Magnolia, which became 
MOVA. And then this one, Texas City, which is Van

18:01.043 --> 18:08.332
Am or Amical, I think. And

18:08.352 --> 18:26.113
I don't remember, but the Humboldt Oil

18:08.352 --> 18:26.113
and Refinery was also in there at the beginning, 
and that became Exxon. And then there, in Farfus

18:26.133 --> 18:30.679
Christie, there were a couple of the Taylor Oil 
Company, which had a lot of our students.

18:31.402 --> 18:34.726
Mannington.

18:34.746 --> 18:39.652
And they eventually sold out.

18:39.732 --> 18:45.679
Were they Aggie-owned,

18:39.732 --> 18:45.679
I wonder, or anything? Yes. Well, no, I don't 
think. Not necessarily. I don't know. Bill Taylor

18:49.483 --> 18:53.848
started a little refinery in East Texas. And then 
he moved down. They moved and built a refinery down

18:55.210 --> 18:58.854
in Corpus Christi. And also another small one. at,

19:01.068 --> 19:08.141
what's the name of the part of the big resort is it? 
Port Isabel. Port Isabel. Port Isabel. Port

19:12.850 --> 19:15.976
Isabel was the refinery that was the Port Isabel. 
And it was a small refinery, but they would And then

19:23.393 --> 19:37.352
there

19:23.393 --> 19:37.352
were one or more other refineries in Corpus. And I 
don't remember the name of them.

19:44.741 --> 19:45.362
Didn't have much to do with it. Those refineries 
then stayed on. There was another refinery right

19:48.106 --> 19:52.692
in Houston in Pasadena. And

19:54.832 --> 20:06.805
then

19:54.832 --> 20:06.805
during the war, that created a lot of things. And

20:07.025 --> 20:23.522
one of this class of mine, first class of 36,

20:07.025 --> 20:23.522
built a good year rubber plant in Pasadena.

20:25.915 --> 20:26.536
Who was that? Do you remember? I can't remember. 
That's okay. I can't remember. You'll have to give

20:30.242 --> 20:33.587
a list of the Class of 1936. And then he went from 
there and became in charge of the government

20:33.608 --> 20:46.549
uranium separation plant. He became manager of

20:46.569 --> 20:51.737
it. I'll find out. That's interesting. And 
another one stayed in there and went to the Air

20:57.953 --> 21:03.421
Force as a test pilot.

21:06.385 --> 21:09.809
And he bought the campus once and twice in a big fee. 
Yeah. 29, I guess it was.

21:14.856 --> 21:22.686
But in that class,

21:14.856 --> 21:22.686
a lot of them went to become managers. manager of 
the paper mill in east texas the manager of the one

21:22.885 --> 21:50.260
in houston i think and they became very high in 
industry yeah

21:22.885 --> 21:50.260
and they did well that's what i heard yeah they did 
very good in the mobile oil We didn't do so well with

21:50.662 --> 21:53.312
Sinclair. There was a pure oil company, and the 
manager of that was one of our students.

22:11.114 --> 22:13.936
What else were they doing besides petroleum? 
Where were your students going? The paper you

22:15.718 --> 22:17.179
mentioned. Yes, that came along.

22:24.646 --> 22:27.688
I don't remember. The management of Diamond 
Outlaw in Pasadena

22:27.708 --> 22:40.159
was built pretty early to make chlorine and 
caustic soda. And the manager of that was one of our

22:41.118 --> 22:51.793
students, one of my students. And when they had a 
surplus of chlorine, they began wanting to use it,

22:51.813 --> 23:00.545
so they began to make chlorinated compounds. And 
in order to get

23:00.565 --> 23:06.433
more chlorinated hydrocarbons, I guess, They 
went to, uh, they bought refinery and diamond oil,

23:07.156 --> 23:16.288
and so they become diamond shamrock. Okay. They 
want shamrock. Yeah. And so then they, they began

23:20.534 --> 23:34.232
to make, uh, mostly,

23:20.534 --> 23:34.232
uh, vinyl fluoride as their main production. And, 
uh... Dital? What kind of chloride? Vinyl

23:37.661 --> 23:41.306
chloride, polyvinyl PVC. They sold, I don't think 
they made the plastic, but they sold PVC. And I

23:47.776 --> 23:59.252
think maybe, one way they made that, they bought 
acetylene from Roman Haas.

24:05.830 --> 24:29.939
Now, Roman

24:05.830 --> 24:29.939
Haas was a very interesting company to me in that 
its raw materials were methane and air

24:05.830 --> 24:29.939
and

24:05.830 --> 24:29.939
very little else. And they made 
methylmethacrylate,

24:32.442 --> 24:43.754
which

24:32.442 --> 24:43.754
is plexiglass. What was their name? Plexiglass, 
what was their name? Plexiglass, what was their

24:48.720 --> 24:49.440
name? DuPont. Anyway, and then they went on to 
other compounds, such as the constant dysplastic

24:50.041 --> 24:59.912
compounds and all that little black thing. Their 
raw materials were just So

25:02.277 --> 25:14.514
plastics basically are beginning to come in in the 
30s or earlier? No, actually

25:14.554 --> 25:30.917
when I was working on plastics,

25:14.554 --> 25:30.917
the only ones in production that were being made 
were the urea formaldehyde discovered about that

25:33.040 --> 25:59.858
time and before that phenol formaldehyde formica 
what was the name of the guy and he wrote

25:33.040 --> 25:59.858
a book on plastics but his book was mostly trial and 
error, like anesthesia. But then, about that

26:06.110 --> 26:22.535
time, in the trunk of the dog,

26:06.110 --> 26:22.535
he studied the theory and figured out why polymers 
were formed. And they have to have two acting

26:25.059 --> 26:28.765
groups. Nylon

26:29.858 --> 26:55.528
has, for example, hexadecane,

26:29.858 --> 26:55.528
hexamethylene diamine, and adipic acid, which is 
a dicompaxilic acid. So that's phenomenal. He

26:58.571 --> 27:22.124
discovered that, and that's why

26:58.571 --> 27:22.124
another, I beg your pardon now, another plastic 
that was being made in those days, and this is what

26:58.571 --> 27:22.124
kept the plant out of problem in the Depression, 
they discovered cellophane, reconstituted

26:58.571 --> 27:22.124
cellulose.

27:22.144 --> 27:26.190
And so they began to make lots of cellophane 
sheets. That kind of stuff really didn't come on

27:27.031 --> 27:34.241
the market until the late 30s and 40s to look for it, 
was it? That's right. They didn't even know much

27:34.541 --> 27:38.447
about it when I graduated in 34. The only thing that 
I'll show you is this.

27:45.076 --> 27:49.001
I'll bring it

27:45.076 --> 27:49.001
over here. Your outcome?

27:57.018 --> 28:24.156
i made two of these i don't know that's been all from 
hell to high okay and that was made i made that back

27:57.018 --> 28:24.156
probably about 1933. did you ever

27:57.018 --> 28:24.156
i had two of them i don't know what happened then i 
think

27:57.018 --> 28:24.156
i made them as later i tried to put some light bulbs 
on them well that's very nice that's A pioneering

28:24.440 --> 28:26.302
piece of work, I would guess. It was more or less 
made by accident. I mixed the phenol and

28:30.246 --> 28:35.151
formaldehyde and it came out that I could cast it. 
And so I began to cast it and then I turned it down in a

28:35.171 --> 28:42.659
lathe and polished it. But that was up to date then. 
That was new. Yeah, I bet it was. However, they had

28:48.144 --> 28:49.806
been making formica for some time, but they 
couldn't make it white. A trace of iron makes this

28:55.864 --> 29:01.411
red, and the phenol. They didn't have very pure 
phenol, but they had a little iron in the phenol,

29:01.431 --> 29:11.144
and it would make a color. Now the phenol,

29:11.205 --> 29:19.776
the urea formaldehyde, could be made white, but it 
was not durable.

29:29.144 --> 29:38.694
So they got into melamine from Mount Hyde, which is 
what most of these dishes are made of. Yeah.

29:40.817 --> 29:41.657
Plastic dishes. Melamine, yes. Plastic

29:42.098 --> 29:48.545
dishes. Now, are some of your students beginning 
to move into research in the 30s and 40s? Of course,

29:54.569 --> 29:56.692
there was wars going on. Not very many went into 
research at that time. We didn't have very many

30:00.295 --> 30:03.818
graduate students. At the time, when we were in the 
chemistry building, I had one graduate student.

30:12.647 --> 30:19.954
He was

30:12.647 --> 30:19.954
trying to make a by-product. He had worked for a 
carbon black company in West Texas. And he found it

30:28.418 --> 30:32.102
up there that they accidentally made lots of 
formaldehyde. And so he was trying to make a

30:33.684 --> 30:43.134
by-product formaldehyde from their carbon 
black,

30:33.684 --> 30:43.134
I guess. And he did some research on formaldehyde. 
Then before that, they had some research students

30:45.637 --> 30:51.643
on cottonseed oil. Now I might better go back. 
Hedges and Duke Thornton had started working with

30:55.717 --> 31:04.909
the cotton seed

30:55.717 --> 31:04.909
people. And they started up the cotton seed oil 
short course.

31:11.497 --> 31:17.825
And it was going when I came

31:11.497 --> 31:17.825
here. And Bishop, more or less, took over the 
supervision of that short course after Duke

31:21.053 --> 31:25.762
Thornton went on. But Duke Thornton stayed with it 
for a while. And even Dr. Hedges was very

31:29.649 --> 31:32.714
enthusiastic about it. And, of course, they built 
a building which

31:33.837 --> 31:42.252
has been torn down to the right. adjacent to the 
parkway, south of the parkway. I don't know what's

31:46.509 --> 31:48.472
there now, but they've torn it down. Yeah, that 
whole part of the campus has really changed. But

31:51.976 --> 32:08.458
anyway,

31:51.976 --> 32:08.458
that was under chemical engineering until one 
time we got a new beam and he put it under the

31:51.976 --> 32:08.458
engineering experimentation and brought in new 
people to run it. That was the food processing, and

32:09.417 --> 32:16.246
I forget the one that's there now. Carl Cater was 
one, and there was a fellow for him that died, and I

32:16.306 --> 32:25.057
don't know him. I've met the fellow now, and I know I 
should know

32:25.297 --> 32:30.925
him. But at that time, I went into research in 
potency. Oh, you did? Solid extraction. and

32:39.235 --> 32:53.815
build

32:39.235 --> 32:53.815
a pilot unit over there. And it might be, I don't 
know, but anyway, I use isopropyl

32:53.835 --> 33:06.833
alcohol as a solvent. And We found that we could 
remove the gossipole from cotton seed. I don't

33:14.529 --> 33:18.955
know whether you know what that gossipole is. It's 
a reddish-brown, beryllium... Under the husk?

33:22.279 --> 33:23.380
Poisonous, but fakes. Yeah, okay. And bad for 
chicken and eggs, and doesn't bother cattle. But

33:28.887 --> 33:33.272
anyway, we could remove it.

33:36.914 --> 33:43.521
So we designed the processing unit, and it's been 
published. And in the last few years, they have

33:43.781 --> 33:53.131
restarted that research out at Bryan Field. And 
they have a fairly large pilot unit using

33:53.191 --> 34:01.540
isopropyl alcohol. And they have developed some 
improvements to take care of some of our problems

34:04.741 --> 34:08.967
out there. That's interesting, isn't it? Coming 
back, huh? I'm still a member of that committee

34:11.410 --> 34:14.354
now. That's good. But I haven't been very active. 
Yeah. Rather than the Leslie Watkins. Les Watkins

34:21.504 --> 34:28.013
was the one that ran around with it.

34:30.978 --> 34:32.740
What do you think would have been... In the 20s and 
30s, I forget the date that chemical engineering

34:33.277 --> 34:52.547
came on as a part of the, I've got it somewhere, but 
as a part of the program in chemistry, what would

34:33.277 --> 34:52.547
you give, say, might have been the primary 
incentives to the development of a chemical

34:33.277 --> 34:52.547
engineering program at Texas A&M in the 20s and 
30s? Would it have been agriculture, cotton, oil,

34:53.829 --> 34:59.318
or should you even say that, just all of those 
things?

35:02.453 --> 35:03.575
Petrochemicals? Well, I think oil was the thing 
that started the interest in chemical

35:03.975 --> 35:12.388
engineering. However, yes it was. The fact that 
this was an agricultural college, why chemical

35:16.534 --> 35:30.115
engineering had to become interested in 
agriculture. Yeah, I kind of felt like it had a

35:30.297 --> 35:42.047
little bit different twist here than it would in 
some of the... Back up in Des Moines, if you want to

35:30.297 --> 35:42.047
take a look out there, these squirrels come up. Oh, 
water, yeah. You know, wild ones. He has been able

35:46.952 --> 35:50.435
to get in there, but we think we've got it wired 
down. He's studying that. I'll figure that out. He

35:58.102 --> 35:59.663
can, he's just getting... She filled it up this 
morning, I think. Yeah. Now,

36:04.982 --> 36:17.055
skipping back up to Iowa, that was the same thing. 
Dr. Sweeney had a department who was interested in

36:17.075 --> 36:22.701
improving coal. The coal had as much as 3% sulfur.

36:30.878 --> 36:49.406
And, of course, it was hard

36:30.878 --> 36:49.406
to burn without making some of the oxides, because 
the plants spit.

36:49.426 --> 36:57.038
And in a water plant, I analyzed the coal, and it ran 
up to three and a half percent sulfur. time. It was

36:58.868 --> 37:01.010
mostly around 2%.

37:04.213 --> 37:05.875
And that was a big problem in Bernie. And then, of 
course, he became interested in the corn stalks

37:08.337 --> 37:14.263
and the soy beans.

37:17.266 --> 37:21.790
And that was why chemical engineering developed 
in Iowa State. And a similar thing down here. They

37:23.952 --> 37:24.493
had It was set up by another called General 
Mechanical College. And the oil production and

37:29.549 --> 37:41.327
oil companies grew and hired these people who used 
the unit operations and used the chemical

37:29.549 --> 37:41.327
processing.

37:44.713 --> 37:48.278
And one of the other plants that was started was 
sulfur. Sulfur. Sulfur Company. And of course,

37:51.403 --> 37:53.586
they made lots of sulfuric acid. to be used in 
petroleum. Petroleum here is a great deal of

37:58.206 --> 38:03.630
sulfuric acid. And then, of course, they began to 
make fertilizer. And incidentally, one of my

38:07.554 --> 38:16.642
students had a big fertilizer plant down in 
Pasadena. He was also, I believe, may have been in

38:16.662 --> 38:22.147
the class of 36, but I'm not sure. Do you remember 
his name? I'm not trying to put you on the spot.

38:26.877 --> 38:29.219
Well, mine neither, so don't worry. Well, me too. 
When I want them, they don't come. Me, I have the

38:34.224 --> 38:36.846
same problem. But that's OK. I'm just curious. OK, 
so let's see. I've probably got you all phased a

38:44.773 --> 38:48.997
little bit here.

38:50.198 --> 38:52.260
One quick question. Do you remember when Gib 
Gilchrist became dean? Yes. Okay, about 1935,

38:57.230 --> 39:00.694
wasn't it? No, no, 37, 38, it doesn't matter. Let me 
see.

39:12.006 --> 39:15.630
And I can't remember who had been dean before him, I 
guess is one question. It was 37 or 38. Yeah, that'd

39:16.932 --> 39:20.796
be right, yeah. Because he left the state after the 
Mall Ferguson regime, I believe, came over to A&M.

39:32.730 --> 39:35.393
Well, he more or less retired. Yeah, from the state 
service. Yeah. Highway. He had been in the highway

39:40.901 --> 39:43.184
department, yeah. And

39:43.625 --> 39:49.433
he was responsible for the traffic circle. there 
at Northgate. Not Northgate, but where College

39:51.909 --> 39:55.773
Avenue comes off. They put a big circle there. And 
they called that Gilchrist Circle. It was a little

40:00.517 --> 40:02.119
too small in diameter. It was hard to get around. 
Get around, was it? That's still a good idea, those

40:03.941 --> 40:05.782
circles. We really work in Europe. We don't do 
that. I interviewed him when I was working that A&M

40:09.266 --> 40:14.271
history way back when. He's an interesting man. He 
was very bitter. As I remember, because he really

40:18.269 --> 40:20.812
had a, he fought the battles. Well, he really took 
care of me all the time. Yeah. He got me this summer

40:23.375 --> 40:28.181
job with the engineering department station. 
Right. And paid me for my research over there in the

40:28.342 --> 40:33.708
privacy lab. He was good, yeah. He was all right. I 
think a lot of people really think he was very good.

40:37.713 --> 40:38.875
He was a little hard to get along with. Yeah, that's 
what they said.

40:43.565 --> 40:49.371
Did he make any changes in the program that you 
remember, you know, other than, I guess,

40:43.565 --> 40:49.371
Experiment Station? Kind of just... The reason I 
ask that, in 1940, I guess it was, he's primarily

40:51.594 --> 41:03.747
responsible, I think, for separating chemistry 
and chemical engineering. Would you say that?

41:05.388 --> 41:08.091
Well, really, he was there. No, it was more or less 
automatic. Dr. Lindsay was in chemical

41:14.075 --> 41:25.932
engineering, and we had to be inspected to be 
approved, and they wouldn't approve us as

41:14.075 --> 41:25.932
chemical engineering department. It's 
accreditation. We were separated. Okay. So that

41:29.097 --> 41:32.001
was the reason it was separated at that time. Okay, 
but now I, somewhere I picked up to that Hedges

41:32.021 --> 41:37.369
really didn't want that to happen. No, and it broke 
his heart, really, for us to leave. And we moved

41:41.154 --> 41:42.276
out, from the chemistry department in the 
petroleum building. And he was very, well, he just

41:48.936 --> 41:56.608
couldn't do anything about stopping us. He just 
had to let it go. And I'm sure that the Elkhurst had

41:58.731 --> 42:06.983
something to do with the separation, but the main 
thing was that we had to. They just wouldn't

42:07.364 --> 42:11.250
approve us, and that's when we were separated. 
Now, what kind of a department head was Lindsey

42:11.720 --> 42:15.223
when he came in? I've got a lot of stuff on. I'm going 
to go over here and talk to Hugh, his son. Well, he

42:19.687 --> 42:26.653
sort of grew to be the department

42:19.687 --> 42:26.653
head. He came in

42:26.673 --> 42:32.979
as a professor and acting head. He wasn't the head 
of the department. See, Hedges was still the head

42:38.644 --> 42:41.727
of the department when Lindsey came in. as a 
chemical engineering professor. And so when they

42:45.158 --> 42:49.403
separated us, they made Lindsey the acting head. 
He was older. He had a little more experience. I was

42:54.228 --> 42:58.012
not made to cut off while I'm there. But anyway, I 
married with a teacher, a chemical engineering

42:58.032 --> 43:04.098
teacher. And we got along all right. There was 
another fellow that came in ahead of Lindsey.

43:12.200 --> 43:16.165
who couldn't get along with the feds, but he was 
there one year. He was from University of

43:16.185 --> 43:30.964
Minnesota, and then he went to Iowa State and was 
there for a few years and died young,

43:16.185 --> 43:30.964
probably young. He was a specialist in just 
infiltration. I can't remember his name either,

43:35.891 --> 43:39.816
but he'll come to me some day. When, when use? split 
out and became an independent department. How

43:44.252 --> 43:46.214
many of you were in that new department? You and 
Lindsey and Bishop? Bishop. Okay. Okay.

43:52.843 --> 43:54.164
We taught all the courses. Okay. And we started 
doing quite a bit

43:55.806 --> 44:02.836
of research. And then during the war,

44:02.856 --> 44:10.185
Kirkbride worked with Lindsey and we taught war 
training courses. Kirk Bryant taught one under

44:17.545 --> 44:24.156
A&M in Houston.

44:24.396 --> 44:27.642
Now who was Kirk Bryant and where did he come from? I 
think he was originally from Michigan, I'm not

44:29.966 --> 44:35.295
sure, but he came to this

44:37.469 --> 44:44.438
chemical oil refinery, a Pan-American oil 
refinery, the Amoco, as assistant director of

44:37.469 --> 44:44.438
research.

44:47.943 --> 44:55.213
And then he came here during the war, he worked with 
A. M. and Dr. Lindsay. And incidentally, Kirk

44:56.154 --> 45:06.328
Pryde and Lindsay and a few of the others from down 
there started the South Texas section of the

45:07.675 --> 45:08.456
A-I-C-H-E. I didn't get in on it much. I did flow 
with them every

45:13.141 --> 45:20.089
time. I was one of the first members of it.

45:27.117 --> 45:27.337
Good.

45:32.463 --> 45:34.565
Now, Kirkbride only stayed a short time. He came up 
here I think he may have stayed a full year.

45:44.584 --> 45:51.172
He taught

45:44.584 --> 45:51.172
and conducted some graduate research. He had one 
or two graduate students and he did a lot of work on

45:51.192 --> 46:05.610
my

45:51.192 --> 46:05.610
gathering data on petroleum hydrocarbons. And he 
wrote a book unit operations.

46:16.762 --> 46:26.556
While he was teaching,

46:16.762 --> 46:26.556
he wrote the book they used. Yeah, I knew he was well 
regarded. And he was a very hard worker. He had a

46:32.945 --> 46:36.831
regular night schedule. I think he took off I spent 
at least four or five nights to go home for supper

46:38.598 --> 46:52.518
and come back and work

46:38.598 --> 46:52.518
till 12 o'clock. Then he became assistant 
director of research for Mobile

46:53.178 --> 47:01.570
Oil in Dallas. They had a big research center 
there. But then they closed it out. He would have

47:09.715 --> 47:12.891
had to come back east.
