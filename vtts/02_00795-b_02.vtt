WEBVTT

00:05.228 --> 00:12.178
The Doctor of Veterinarian Medicine degree was 
first granted at Texas A&M in 1920. Yeah. But the

00:14.321 --> 00:23.694
school didn't grant a master's degree in 
Veterinarian Medicine or a doctor, well the

00:14.321 --> 00:23.694
doctor's degree was first issued in 1955. I was 
wondering why did it take so long? Well because

00:36.160 --> 00:41.567
The enrollment was relatively small, and we 
didn't have research individuals.

00:43.971 --> 01:01.915
Most of them had a degree in veterinary medicine, 
but did not have any advanced degrees in research,

00:43.971 --> 01:01.915
like master's and

00:43.971 --> 01:01.915
PhD. that had to come gradually as more of the staff 
had an opportunity to get, in other words, lots of

01:03.869 --> 01:21.089
them would have to take courses

01:03.869 --> 01:21.089
and take them four, five, six years to get a 
master's degree. So it took quite a while to build

01:22.852 --> 01:32.543
up a backlog of individuals that were 
research-minded.

01:35.206 --> 01:38.932
To be a good research man, you've got to be research 
minded. And originally, we were trying to turn out

01:40.614 --> 01:45.602
clinicians. Right. And research was something 
else. Now it wasn't until after the war that they

01:50.970 --> 01:57.260
really started putting pressure on. Who's they? 
Who's they? The college authorities, the

02:00.284 --> 02:02.788
university authorities. Okay. on departments to 
get advanced degrees and do research.

02:12.770 --> 02:18.536
Up to that time, A&M

02:12.770 --> 02:18.536
was not a great research institution. And then, in 
other words, it was sometime between, or it was

02:19.497 --> 02:33.732
right after the Second World War, as a matter of 
fact, that the emphasis of the School of

02:19.497 --> 02:33.732
Veterinarian Medicine changed. one from, and 
correct me if I'm wrong, a training ground for

02:34.218 --> 02:45.337
clinicians to a much more specialized and a much 
more research-oriented school? Yes. I'd say

02:48.142 --> 02:50.446
that's right. And do you think that the 
specialization has had an impact on the quality of

02:52.169 --> 02:58.740
education?

03:04.762 --> 03:12.113
That's hard to evaluate, for me to evaluate. Now, a 
man that's doing research, I'll say this, he likes

03:12.834 --> 03:25.133
in his classes, he'll always be drumming his 
students on what he has discovered in research or

03:26.159 --> 03:32.866
what research he's doing and he's going to put a lot 
of emphasis on his research. Whereas the men who

03:34.108 --> 03:44.920
were teaching as more or less clinicians

03:34.108 --> 03:44.920
put it more on the practical side. So I think you can 
go as far as training. If you're going to train

03:50.085 --> 03:56.132
veterinarians to be veterinarians, you can go 
overboard on research. You'd much rather have

03:59.702 --> 04:11.761
them good surgeons or good internal medicine or 
something of that nature rather than full of a

03:59.702 --> 04:11.761
bunch of research statistics. There's after all, 
there's just so much time. Right, absolutely.

04:20.362 --> 04:25.248
You're either going to turn out a good clinician or 
a good research man. And when does the student make

04:25.268 --> 04:30.655
up his mind if he wants to be a clinician or if he 
wants to go on for an advanced degree? It has to be

04:30.675 --> 04:32.377
after he graduates. After he gets his doctorate in 
medicine. That's right. OK. You know, as you well

04:37.763 --> 04:48.917
know, in the last half century, there's been a 
trend in most fields, especially in medicine, it

04:37.763 --> 04:48.917
seems to me, a trend from training general 
practitioners to specialists. We can even see

04:55.325 --> 04:57.408
this in the field of history. American historians 
to people who are studying just recent American

04:58.390 --> 05:06.742
history, or people who are just studying economic 
American history, or something like that. Much

05:06.822 --> 05:08.224
more specialization. Is that the same tendency in 
veterinarian medicine? Seems to be, yes. In other

05:16.336 --> 05:28.031
words, as you get these staff members who are PhDs, 
now bear in mind, that's a research. They're going

05:28.051 --> 05:31.716
to want to teach that one specialty. That's the 
thing they know the best, and that's what they

05:32.757 --> 05:36.642
should be teaching. So, yes, there's quite a 
difference there.

05:48.584 --> 05:53.130
Are there any other reasons besides these 
advanced degree people? Are there any other

05:53.170 --> 05:56.475
reasons, do you think, for more specialization?

06:00.741 --> 06:02.483
Well, it's just personal preference. Just like 
one man going to small animals and one man going to

06:04.666 --> 06:15.081
large animals, it's just what you'd like to do. No, 
if you want to be a research man, you can't be a

06:16.293 --> 06:24.301
practitioner, because you'd starve to death. 
Somebody has to foot the bill for research. In most

06:30.166 --> 06:32.509
cases, it's the government.

06:36.352 --> 06:43.259
Let's talk about your duties

06:36.352 --> 06:43.259
from the Second World War to the present. You were 
the head of Veterinarian Hygiene, and then you

06:45.689 --> 06:50.435
were Assistant Dean in Curricular Affairs. We 
talked about Veterinarian Hygiene. Can you tell

06:52.558 --> 06:55.242
us about the Assistant Dean in Curricular 
Affairs? What did you do there? What were your

06:57.084 --> 06:58.486
functions and duties? I served just as a dean. The 
Dean Boughton had a stroke and was incapacitated.

07:12.704 --> 07:14.667
So I was acting dean. Hiring and firing and- 
Everything, yeah. Salaries and- The whole works.

07:21.930 --> 07:22.951
All administrative. How'd you like that? Not too 
much. Why not? It's pretty draggy. You get into

07:29.777 --> 07:44.350
administration, a lot of paperwork, and here 
there's always somebody coming up with some fool

07:29.777 --> 07:44.350
questionnaire that they want you to fill out.

07:44.768 --> 07:47.130
You're up in cloud nine half the time. So,

07:49.653 --> 08:02.045
I enjoyed it all right, but there's lots of 
pressures there that are not too enjoyable.

08:08.271 --> 08:14.016
Yeah, you're always having to do things that you'd 
rather not do. because they have to be done. For

08:19.700 --> 08:20.381
example? Well, there's always all kinds of

08:22.784 --> 08:33.100
meetings to go to all over the country, one kind or 
another. All these associations of universities

08:34.302 --> 08:42.855
and all that, and that gets pretty tiresome. and it 
takes up a lot of time that you'd rather be doing

08:44.506 --> 08:49.052
something else with. And while you had this 
position, did you have any classroom

08:51.475 --> 08:56.662
responsibilities? Yeah, I went on with, sure.

09:02.790 --> 09:05.814
So this is sort of an extra burden. That's right. 
That's what it amounted to. Somebody had to do it

09:11.262 --> 09:13.905
and they asked me to do it. So I did it. Why do you 
think they asked you? I don't know.

09:21.768 --> 09:22.508
Because they liked me. I don't know. At least the 
ones that were in there at the time. But

09:28.033 --> 09:32.897
I don't know why they asked me. Now, after that 
position, you were head of the Department of

09:34.138 --> 09:38.442
Public Health. In what way was that different than 
being head of the Department of Veterinary and

09:39.903 --> 09:44.247
Hygiene? Same thing. Just a different name? Just a 
different name. I told you in the beginning that

09:49.343 --> 09:56.373
veterinary hygiene was a poor choice of terms. But 
they couldn't come up with a better one.

10:06.466 --> 10:11.974
During 30 years, you must have been on some 
important committees. Would you like to talk

10:13.716 --> 10:15.178
about that?

10:21.773 --> 10:25.438
Golly, I can't remember the committees I was on.

10:29.723 --> 10:41.297
I was on the athletic council one time, and

10:29.723 --> 10:41.297
I was on other committees, but I can't remember 
what they were now. They'd function for a while,

10:41.357 --> 10:50.228
they'd do what they had to do and be disbanded.

10:51.710 --> 10:55.114
That was kind of a constant thing going on all the 
time.

10:58.017 --> 11:06.666
You'd be appointed to a committee or else you'd be 
asked or told to do certain things and I can't

10:58.017 --> 11:06.666
remember all those. Then let's go back to what we 
were just talking about and that is research. I

11:13.554 --> 11:16.217
have a couple of quick questions on research. It 
appears that research in American Veterinarian

11:20.768 --> 11:26.516
Medicine has made some great strides in the last 30 
years or so. What is the School of Veterinary, what

11:28.539 --> 11:37.191
fields of research are we strong in at the School of 
Veterinarian Medicine here? I can't answer that.

11:39.534 --> 11:39.975
I don't know.

11:43.239 --> 11:45.763
Well I can't, I know when I was out there, I guess, 
poultry diseases. They were strong on poultry

11:51.890 --> 11:53.792
diseases.

12:04.227 --> 12:10.736
That's about the only thing we were strong on as far 
as research is concerned that I can think of at that

12:04.227 --> 12:10.736
time. Not with cattle research? You know, it just 
seems to me, Texas, cattle, Texas A&M School of

12:16.928 --> 12:24.136
Veterinary Medicine probably would be pretty 
strong in cattle.

12:24.156 --> 12:32.926
Well, yes, but your teaching staff didn't have 
much time

12:24.156 --> 12:32.926
for research. Now, Dr. Schmidt, principally that 
was his job. He was always doing research or

12:39.073 --> 12:46.902
troubleshooting.

12:48.367 --> 12:57.278
He did a lot of research on

12:48.367 --> 12:57.278
pyroplasmosis, pyroplasmosis.

13:00.642 --> 13:02.965
Then they did some on anaplasmosis. They did quite 
a bit on anaplasmosis. They did have, they did some

13:07.070 --> 13:14.239
work on, they had a black-legged research project 
and an anthrax research project.

13:24.596 --> 13:28.041
And, but I don't, I came, I wasn't too familiar with 
the prize. See, that was separate. Right. I

13:30.865 --> 13:31.586
understand that. I was just, I just wanted your 
ideas on this. During your last few years here,

13:34.510 --> 13:45.525
here, we, the nation seemed, and I've talked to 
people up at Purdue about this, the nation and

13:46.062 --> 13:57.959
seemed to go through a green revolution they 
called it, the green revolution in the 1960s and

13:46.062 --> 13:57.959
the increase in production and new strains of 
wheat and all, things like that. Do you remember if

13:59.722 --> 14:09.035
that was a topic of conversation here in your last 
four or five years or did it have any impact at all?

14:09.055 --> 14:10.857
No, not on me. Okay, fine, fine. And that brings me, 
speaking on a more international scene, that

14:12.893 --> 14:17.978
brings me to another question. That is 
international studies. Did you have any role

14:21.261 --> 14:27.747
whatsoever in international studies in the 
School of Veterinary Medicine?

14:39.438 --> 14:41.820
Not in the School of Veterinary Medicine. Now I did 
attend some conferences that had to do with

14:42.458 --> 15:02.712
international veterinary problems,

14:42.458 --> 15:02.712
but I don't think it affected us there in the 
veterinary college.

15:15.263 --> 15:43.752
It was just a question of

15:15.263 --> 15:43.752
listening to these people from various countries 
talk about their problems, and usually it was the

15:15.263 --> 15:43.752
government men that, that is the American 
government men, veterinarians and whatnot, that

15:15.263 --> 15:43.752
more or less call the shots because they were 
putting up all the money. Sure, sure. In other

15:49.536 --> 15:52.480
words, you didn't spend any time overseas. No. For 
example, Dr. Turk spent some time in South

15:52.921 --> 15:56.847
America. Oh, he went to Peru once. No. Now Ted 
Franklin spent more time out of the country, I

15:59.812 --> 16:05.841
guess, than anybody else. He was in

16:05.881 --> 16:12.051
the Dominican Republic for a while.

16:14.782 --> 16:20.609
And

16:14.782 --> 16:20.609
where else did he go? I think he went to Africa for a 
while. And

16:24.173 --> 16:34.465
well, there's a man in parasitology that was in 
Africa for a year.

16:39.811 --> 16:43.135
When did we start having these more international 
contacts? After World War I, II. After World War

16:46.542 --> 16:47.343
II? In the late 1940s and then the 50s? Yeah.

16:55.955 --> 16:57.577
Mostly in the 50s, I'd say.

17:04.186 --> 17:12.598
Oh lots of, some of these South American countries 
would want to set up a veterinary school or start a

17:04.186 --> 17:12.598
veterinary school.

17:13.439 --> 17:16.423
They'd ask someone to come down and help them. 
Sure, right. They'd say they wanted to ask me to go

17:20.328 --> 17:24.834
to Venezuela one time, but I wasn't interested. 
That was after I retired. I think it was Venezuela,

17:27.357 --> 17:29.500
somewhere down there.

17:32.324 --> 17:37.210
And I've forgotten what they called those 
programs. Anyway, they had a, government was also

17:41.317 --> 18:08.286
sponsoring another program that had to do with the 
retired people, not necessarily in veterinary

17:41.317 --> 18:08.286
medicine, but businessmen, creamery operators, 
owners of, and who had retired, had to go to

17:41.317 --> 18:08.286
Thailand or somewhere and set up, help them set up a 
creamery over there.

18:11.438 --> 18:15.023
But no, it didn't affect us too much.

18:18.628 --> 18:27.199
Now could we turn back to your service, your 
personal service over almost 30 years in the vet

18:18.628 --> 18:27.199
school.

18:31.045 --> 18:35.671
In every man's career, really there are high 
points and low points you might say. Could you

18:35.931 --> 18:38.695
reflect on what you feel were perhaps your 
shortcomings or things that you thought you

18:39.316 --> 18:53.755
wanted to complete, but you just for some reason 
didn't, and then on what you feel are your

18:39.316 --> 18:53.755
achievements, things that you did achieve.

18:58.281 --> 19:06.252
No,

18:58.281 --> 19:06.252
I don't think I have anything that I that strikes me 
as being a high point or a low point in my career is

19:06.603 --> 19:19.175
more or less doing things that needed to be done. I

19:19.195 --> 19:28.004
can't think of it as being a high point or a low 
point. It was more or less of a plateau all the way

19:28.324 --> 19:31.867
through for me. How about strengths? strengths or 
weaknesses. What fields did you feel that you made

19:38.536 --> 19:46.226
a strong contribution teaching?

19:49.490 --> 20:03.508
Well, I guess it was in developing that veterinary 
public health program because there was nothing

19:49.490 --> 20:03.508
there when I went there. And I had to start from 
scratch and develop it. And well, I'm still

20:13.870 --> 20:17.934
developing it. When I left there,

20:20.256 --> 20:27.663
Dr. Russell had come there with me. I think that was 
in about 1957, 58.

20:35.129 --> 21:02.655
he had a master's public health that he'd gotten at 
Tulane and

20:35.129 --> 21:02.655
then we developed some of course an epidemiology 
that

20:35.129 --> 21:02.655
veterinary, well public health and this 
epidemiology of course is

21:08.322 --> 21:11.066
how different diseases are transmitted. In other 
words, the history of the outbreak, that sort of

21:12.127 --> 21:17.795
thing, and how it behaves.

21:20.299 --> 21:27.008
And then while he was there, he got his PhD there at 
A&M, and he's still out there. I think he teaches

21:28.971 --> 21:32.035
mostly epidemiology now.

21:46.257 --> 21:50.845
So I don't know that there's any, that I have any 
high points. What about your students in

21:51.205 --> 21:55.132
veterinary or in public health? Where were most of 
those people placed and what are they doing?

22:04.187 --> 22:10.577
Well, a lot of them, after they graduated of 
course, They don't come to any, they don't take

22:12.886 --> 22:21.554
veterinary medicine to become veterinary 
hygienists or anything of that nature. They come

22:22.315 --> 22:26.259
there to become practitioners. Now a lot of them, 
after they graduated, they went to the service and

22:26.279 --> 22:34.327
a lot of them are in public health work. I see. As a 
result of that, and

22:44.746 --> 22:56.960
I hope that what we gave them in veterinary hygiene 
and veterinary public health was a stepping stone

22:44.746 --> 22:56.960
to help them while they were in the service. Now 
most of them that didn't go to the service don't go

22:59.202 --> 23:05.369
into public health. For some reason or other they 
become, while they're in the service, since

23:07.591 --> 23:13.538
they're principal job is public health. I think a 
lot of them go into public health work when they get

23:19.006 --> 23:24.732
out of the service.

23:28.397 --> 23:44.014
Rather than go into, well they've been out of 
contact with practice, with the practice of

23:28.397 --> 23:44.014
veterinary medicine, and they prefer to go into 
public health work. rather than try to catch up on

23:44.753 --> 23:51.840
what's happened in the clinical subjects and go 
into practice. Now that's a

23:53.061 --> 23:58.946
feeling I have. OK. I have a final question. We've 
talked about a number of changes in the School of

24:02.830 --> 24:11.858
Vet and Medicine since the 1920s to your 
retirement in 1965. along with your thoughts on a

24:12.344 --> 24:15.108
lot of these changes. What have I missed? Is there 
anything that I haven't talked about or asked that

24:19.534 --> 24:24.641
you'd like to discuss? No, I think you've about 
cleaned me out. I can't say that I can think of

24:29.648 --> 24:39.201
anything

24:29.648 --> 24:39.201
more that I can throw in there. Anything with your 
career would that you'd like to talk about. I'm

24:44.295 --> 24:50.122
sure there's probably something in there that 
I've missed about your personal career that you

24:44.295 --> 24:50.122
might.

24:57.431 --> 25:02.016
Oh, my personal career I guess has been pretty 
uninteresting. Uninteresting

25:03.298 --> 25:09.385
to anybody else but me.

25:17.228 --> 25:19.070
I had lots of good experiences. I appreciate all of 
them. All of them taught me something when I was in

25:22.113 --> 25:47.218
practice and then working for the city in Beaumont 
and coming to A&M and trying to develop a course or

25:22.113 --> 25:47.218
courses in, well, veterinary hygiene at that 
time. later became Veterinary Public Health.

discuss that I might have missed?

26:15.842 --> 26:17.644
I can't think of anything right now.

26:20.425 --> 26:24.973
As I tell most people, I'll think about it about 
midnight and I'll call you. But

26:27.137 --> 26:33.088
no, I can't think of anything else right now. Okay,
