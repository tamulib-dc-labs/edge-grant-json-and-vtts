WEBVTT

00:01.718 --> 00:08.928
General LeMay arrived at about the Vietnamese 
situation and their air force, your air bases?

00:10.450 --> 00:26.832
Well, he came in and visited not only our own air 
bases, which I think we had two at the time, but he

00:10.450 --> 00:26.832
went out and visited some of the Vietnamese 
commands. And I don't know that we really... came

00:31.756 --> 00:54.746
to any conclusion, you really don't come to any 
conclusion when you're just following some

00:31.756 --> 00:54.746
four-star general around

00:31.756 --> 00:54.746
where he has a massive staff with him and he's just 
looking at the situation, getting appraised of

00:31.756 --> 00:54.746
what was going on out there. Okay, well what were 
your impressions? You must have been coming from

00:58.267 --> 01:02.892
Hawaii and going to this primitive land. You must 
have had some impression about our capabilities

01:02.912 --> 01:08.618
of fighting that war. Well, I would say that your 
impression was you couldn't really depend on the

01:09.418 --> 01:24.814
Vietnamese people to do very much of your fighting 
for you, unless you took a long time in training

01:09.418 --> 01:24.814
them. and organizing these mountain guard

01:25.570 --> 01:34.742
backwoodsmen into the fighting force.

01:37.526 --> 01:37.987
I don't know. You look at the problem of just 
communications.

01:44.515 --> 01:53.367
Certainly these old mountain guard people are 
certainly not going to learn any English, or not

01:44.515 --> 01:53.367
very much.

01:55.118 --> 02:02.347
trying to train a foreigner in the English 
language for him to fight your war. It was a major

02:02.507 --> 02:04.489
problem. Do you think that was a major problem of 
American strategy? Let me answer that.

02:14.541 --> 02:22.290
Do you think that part of the problem of American 
military was being rather Gung-ho on the war in

02:23.671 --> 02:32.403
Vietnam was, I mean, that we set ourselves up as we 
can't win this war. You're talking about all the

02:32.423 --> 02:34.326
problems now. Did the military back in 1962 
perceive all these problems, or was it just a

02:34.847 --> 02:42.538
can-do type feeling? No, I think it's a matter of 
the strategy of just gradually putting another

02:42.558 --> 02:52.632
small I really think the strategy that we had at 
that time was a small build up to just almost stay

02:53.641 --> 03:11.692
even with Yvette Kahn.

03:13.455 --> 03:19.024
It was only much later I think that we even 
committed major forces and had we committed those

03:19.561 --> 03:25.147
two or three years earlier, we probably would have 
gotten the job done. But we were always just

03:25.227 --> 03:34.158
committing enough of the force to kind of stay 
even. Of course, this is what we're talking about

03:35.039 --> 03:40.825
now, Secretary McNamara's idea of flexible 
response. Do you remember what your thoughts

03:42.027 --> 03:48.454
about flexible response were and what your 
commander's thoughts about McNamara? Well,

03:48.890 --> 04:09.531
see your problem in the military, your commanders 
really don't get involved in all the top secret

03:48.890 --> 04:09.531
information that you have at the headquarters.

04:10.439 --> 04:13.984
And like the commander Masawa, he's completely 
out of the picture. I mean, they don't provide you

04:14.084 --> 04:17.189
any information up there. You have a different 
mission altogether. So your commander of your

04:19.412 --> 04:36.717
13th Air Force, who was in the Philippines, who was 
supporting the Vietnamese war, and then you had a

04:19.412 --> 04:36.717
brigadier general at that time, chief of the 
military assistance group over in Dunham, so that

04:37.135 --> 04:54.521
you don't really have a lot of people coming in and 
pounding the desk and saying, let's do this and

04:37.135 --> 04:54.521
let's do that. What about at the Pacific Air Force 
headquarters? What about there? Four-star

05:01.432 --> 05:04.797
general, he must have had some dealings with that. 
uh... secretary of defense well yeah i hear any

05:05.283 --> 05:28.489
scuttle about uh... what they thought about well 
you're uh...

05:05.283 --> 05:28.489
you don't you don't uh... i don't think you i don't 
think you hear general o'donnell uh... pounding

05:05.283 --> 05:28.489
his desk and saying mcnamara is crazy i mean you 
just don't you don't do that type of thing. I just

05:31.466 --> 05:36.874
don't think that you really criticize your 
superiors before your juniors. It's a

05:37.015 --> 05:42.844
know-it-all type of thing. Now, I have met with 
Michael Mayer when he came out to the PACCOM

05:44.026 --> 05:52.840
headquarters and where he gave you a briefing. his 
staff would give you a briefing or you'd give him a

05:53.242 --> 05:59.488
briefing first as to what the status of activities 
were. But you didn't have your commander sitting

06:00.249 --> 06:14.683
around pounding and saying that this guy's crazy

06:00.249 --> 06:14.683
because he's just not being a good commander. When 
you met McNamara, what were your impressions?

06:20.545 --> 06:31.676
He was a whiz kid type of thing, and of course he's 
the one that set up the program of retiring people

06:20.545 --> 06:31.676
over 55. You weren't too excited about it. I wasn't 
too excited about it, no. And I'm wondering what

06:37.442 --> 06:42.527
his ideas on retirement are today. Certainly it's 
not the idea that you that he should be put out to

06:46.533 --> 06:55.663
pasture by the time he's fifty-five because he's 
beyond that age now and I still say he's still

06:46.533 --> 06:55.663
working. He's retiring next year I think, or at the 
end of this year as the president of the World Bank,

06:55.723 --> 07:02.270
but he's way over fifty-five. Yes, right. Okay, do 
you remember, you said that you wrote a report, you

07:05.934 --> 07:16.405
and General LeMay, or you had some input on that. 
report on the mission, your visit to Vietnam. Do

07:19.697 --> 07:22.140
you remember anything that you said in that 
report? No, I really don't. I was looking through

07:23.562 --> 07:29.971
my files where I was searching for my resume and 
this type of thing. I ran across

07:30.151 --> 07:42.167
a document which covered General LeMay's trip to 
Vietnam, but I don't remember anything about it.

07:44.110 --> 07:45.852
Was he in pretty good humor to see you again? Oh 
yeah, he always remembered me.

07:57.562 --> 08:11.080
Well, I think that we should talk about what you 
think, after 30 years in the service, are the

07:57.562 --> 08:11.080
highlights of your career and what we might call 
the low points if we can. It seems to me like some of

08:15.074 --> 08:22.341
the major highlights, a commander of the 39th Air 
Division, seems like one of the jobs that you

08:15.074 --> 08:22.341
enjoyed the most. And then, of course, when you 
were the commander of the 379th down in Homestead,

08:24.804 --> 08:33.292
sounds like you were very interested then in the 
823rd. Am I right in those assumptions? Well, I

08:35.134 --> 08:38.418
basically like to be boss. I mean, I'm... And of 
course, I think that the jobs that I had in the Air

08:41.215 --> 08:49.368
Force were real quality jobs. I mean, being, well, 
going, I'd say my first big job was the radio school

08:49.388 --> 09:04.152
at Sioux Falls, South Dakota, where you build it 
from scratch with using a having available to you a

09:05.566 --> 09:18.880
bunch of second lieutenants and you were the 
lieutenant colonel and the second senior officer

09:05.566 --> 09:18.880
on the base, why that job I enjoyed. I would say the 
next job I enjoyed was the radar school down in Boca

09:20.522 --> 09:26.908
Raton, Florida. Setting that up. Ends up setting 
that up. I'm not a I'm not a particularly strong

09:32.397 --> 09:36.263
staff guy. I like to be out, rather than sitting 
behind a desk writing papers, I like to be out

09:37.825 --> 09:47.920
generating enthusiasm in people.

09:51.024 --> 10:01.780
Then from there, commanding the security service 
was a very challenging job. You're talking about a

10:02.738 --> 10:04.081
low point. I would say that when I was removed from 
being commander of security service up to the

10:04.161 --> 10:24.460
deputy director of NSA, although the jobs were 
equivalent, I thought I was being moved out and

10:04.161 --> 10:24.460
replaced by a higher-ranking colonel who at the 
same time was promoted to BG. So did you consider

10:30.246 --> 10:39.999
that job as the deputy director of the National 
Security Agency sort of a setback? Oh, yeah. Yeah,

10:41.581 --> 10:42.983
I consider that a setback. A demotion? Would you 
consider it a demotion? Well, you can't really say

10:44.785 --> 10:49.251
a demotion. As far as I was concerned, it was a 
demotion. I mean, it was an equal-status job.

10:54.438 --> 10:54.598
Yeah. And of course, I was Wade Jr. to General Lynn, 
or Roy Lynn, who replaced me as Commander of the

10:55.169 --> 11:06.386
Security Service. And he was promoted at the same 
time he was moved in to a BG-7 grade. So I figured I'd

11:12.375 --> 11:24.113
work my tail off getting the Security Service 
organized, and then he gets promoted and comes

11:12.375 --> 11:24.113
down and take over a pretty well-run 
organization.

11:29.299 --> 11:30.701
And you wanted that job. Well, I was interested in 
keeping the job. But you wanted the star and you

11:34.767 --> 11:41.376
wanted... Well, I was interested in a job and I was 
interested in promotion. Sure. And so therefore,

11:42.457 --> 11:49.166
at that time, I figured that maybe I wasn't going to 
get promoted. And because... Neither one of the

11:53.438 --> 12:00.908
deputies were, although they were one star slots, 
neither one of them had been promoted. Navy, Army,

12:01.549 --> 12:06.196
or the Air Force. And

12:06.216 --> 12:12.104
I'd say that was a low spot anyway. I was unhappy 
with the job at being director. And it was at this

12:16.410 --> 12:19.935
time when you were getting your MBA and 
considering of getting out of the service. Yeah,

12:22.048 --> 12:28.676
if I didn't move from, I was willing to put up with it 
for a couple of years. And then from there. There

12:32.200 --> 12:35.905
you have four command jobs in a row. Then from there 
you go to 379th Bomb Wing, which is a very, that job I

12:36.105 --> 12:45.616
thoroughly enjoyed. And being a commander of 
eight 23rd Air Division was a step up and you got

12:49.514 --> 12:54.041
promoted. Being moved out of that job into a MAG 
job, I figured that was a demotion. Although both

13:01.995 --> 13:09.808
of them were occupied by a Major General, I mean a 
Brigadier General. So I replaced the Brigadier

13:10.549 --> 13:12.552
General. You can't say it was demotion as far as I 
was concerned. But it wasn't a command. Well, it

13:18.500 --> 13:21.003
wasn't a command job. Then of course you moved to 
the 39th Air Division. I moved to Sawa. And again,

13:24.688 --> 13:27.011
that was a good job. And the two jobs that I had in 
PACAF headquarters were real good jobs. I mean, I

13:31.817 --> 13:35.822
thoroughly enjoyed them. And because you were 
almost a deputy commander there in your

13:36.967 --> 13:45.218
particular field and you had a lot of 
responsibility. What was your favorite job of

13:45.238 --> 13:51.928
your entire career? Well, I would say that your 
Sioux Falls, South Dakota

13:52.188 --> 14:02.442
was a real good job. I mean I thoroughly enjoyed 
that. thoroughly enjoyed, well the one at the

14:07.358 --> 14:18.195
radar school was not as enjoyable because I wasn't 
technically qualified as a radar officer. I mean I

14:18.215 --> 14:27.830
was, you were directing an organization in which 
you weren't technically qualified to supervise

14:18.215 --> 14:27.830
the technical aspects. You had to depend on 
somebody else to provide that. The only thing is

14:31.035 --> 14:33.940
you just

14:36.350 --> 14:42.539
just by force that you change the character of the 
school. Then

14:43.801 --> 14:57.622
from there going to 5th Bomber Command as a 
communications officer, I'd say that's one of my

14:43.801 --> 14:57.622
low spots. I've gone to B-29 Transition School and 
then you get shipped all over to

15:06.826 --> 15:21.146
to an organization as a communications officer, 
and although you were an administrator of a

15:06.826 --> 15:21.146
technical radio school, I still wasn't a 
technical officer as far as communications was

15:06.826 --> 15:21.146
concerned. I couldn't

15:21.166 --> 15:31.060
really teach radio, the theory of it. I was 
administrator type. And then I always worked

15:33.809 --> 15:37.272
myself out of these communication jobs. I was very 
happy with those. But when you get into being the

15:40.055 --> 15:54.468
A3, the operations, deputy for operations in 5th 
Bomber Command, deputy of operations for 5th Air

15:40.055 --> 15:54.468
Force, I like those jobs pretty well. Although I 
like being in that command of the 315th. I was back

16:00.574 --> 16:01.875
in my was a true element.

16:06.957 --> 16:18.269
Because I just liked to be responsible and

16:06.957 --> 16:18.269
then

16:06.957 --> 16:18.269
the Air Force Security Service would have gone 
over. But so, any command job, I was really like to

16:19.189 --> 16:26.677
be the boss. Did, you know, very few men become 
generals. Did you consider yourself during your

16:32.315 --> 16:35.120
career ambitious?

16:38.485 --> 16:40.950
Well, yeah, I watched everybody else getting 
promoted. Every promotion that came out, you

16:41.110 --> 16:48.683
looked it over and tried to figure out how he got 
promoted and you didn't. And did you think that

16:50.105 --> 16:58.339
your advancement was, when you figured these 
things out or tried to figure these things out, did

16:50.105 --> 16:58.339
you think that your advancement in the in the 
military was because of luck, or fate, or

16:58.741 --> 17:08.575
something that you had no control over, or was it 
because of your own actions, your own behavior?

17:09.296 --> 17:10.297
Which was most important? I think your own actions 
and your own behavior. I think

17:12.560 --> 17:28.242
that had I been in a different position, I would 
have gotten promoted

17:12.560 --> 17:28.242
with or the guy who did get promoted in that 
particular job. I mean, he just happened to get

17:32.164 --> 17:35.149
selected for that. And I know that when I came back 
from Japan the first time, I was being considered

17:35.270 --> 17:49.415
for a job in the Pentagon being the director of 
technical training. It was Air Force-wide.

17:54.749 --> 18:02.739
And the guy, the individual, one of my classmates 
who took that, who got that job, and I kind of went to

17:54.749 --> 18:02.739
their war college. So it just happened that I got 
selected to war college instead of taking that

18:03.159 --> 18:07.004
job. He and I were probably equally qualified. 
Well, he ended up with a four-star, as a four-star

18:09.927 --> 18:12.951
general. It's just one of those, that particular 
thing, there's no way of guiding your career

18:25.090 --> 18:27.994
into the lucky spots.

18:29.255 --> 18:36.745
My philosophy, I guess, was that if you do a good 
job, you'll come to the attention of the right

18:29.255 --> 18:36.745
people. Maybe that I didn't pay politics, play 
enough golf with the boss that he got to know you

18:36.765 --> 18:52.806
better personally. Is that important in the 
service? Oh, I think that it's...

18:54.622 --> 19:03.613
Well, it's hard to say. It's not my philosophy of 
operation. But you look at some of the people who

19:06.417 --> 19:23.498
did get to be known by their golfing and

19:06.417 --> 19:23.498
personal contact, they seem to get ahead a little 
faster than... the ones who really

19:23.866 --> 19:33.216
kept their light under the bushel. In other words, 
those people promoted themselves more? Is that

19:38.081 --> 19:39.062
what we're talking about? Well, they got promoted 
because they got to be known more.

19:45.249 --> 19:47.452
You have to face the fact. If a guy works as a major in 
the Secretary of Defense's office, or a

19:53.110 --> 20:02.946
lieutenant colonel, why then the secretary of 
defense, if he sends a note down to the chief of the

19:53.110 --> 20:02.946
staff of the Air Force to promote this guy, the 
chances are he's going to get promoted. I mean, he

20:03.768 --> 20:05.991
doesn't have to go through all the selection 
process. I think that it's

20:13.462 --> 20:15.986
it's really a problem of getting to be known. I 
mean, just like running the radio school at Sioux

20:16.126 --> 20:20.353
Falls, you've got to be known. You've got to be 
known by the commanders in Second Air Force who

20:20.373 --> 20:33.595
were cadres, and your contemporaries are the ones 
that really promote you, I think. I

20:33.835 --> 20:40.566
don't know, you can't Normally the setbacks that 
you have, I think you have to look at them that

20:42.368 --> 21:07.078
although your ego gets bruised rather 
thoroughly, maybe if you look back on it, maybe

20:42.368 --> 21:07.078
that's the best thing that happened to you.

21:08.039 --> 21:11.143
Maybe you don't get fired, maybe you get replaced. 
And so maybe you change the direction just a little

21:11.697 --> 21:18.324
bit in your career. You've been a success both in 
the military and in your civilian career in the

21:19.925 --> 21:25.931
building business. And you've had assignments 
and leadership in both the military and in the

21:26.852 --> 21:33.639
civilian. How do you get ahead in both of these? Is 
there any difference between getting ahead in the

21:36.122 --> 21:41.367
business world and getting ahead in the military? 
Well, there's one major difference. In the

21:49.471 --> 21:56.378
military, when someone verbally tells you 
they're going to do something, the chances are

21:49.471 --> 21:56.378
they're going to do it. In the civilian business 
world, a lot of people tell you they're going to do

21:57.799 --> 22:08.890
something, and they have no intention of ever 
doing it. I mean, it's a question of honesty here?

22:11.007 --> 22:13.030
It's a matter of honesty, as far as I'm concerned. 
You think that officers in the Air Corps in general

22:13.350 --> 22:20.319
are more honest than the average businessman? I 
would say so, yeah. I'd say honesty in civilian

22:22.922 --> 22:27.568
life is improved by having it in writing. I mean, 
it's

22:28.650 --> 22:33.736
very simple. You just can't depend on... on people 
to do what they say they're going to do. Whereas in

22:43.254 --> 22:57.296
the military, you've been taught for four years at 
the military academy and 30 years in the military

22:43.254 --> 22:57.296
that a man's word is his bond. And

22:58.017 --> 23:06.450
in civilian life, that's just not true. You can't 
pay an individual who says that he's completed

23:07.308 --> 23:19.345
your roof without going out and looking at the roof 
to see that he has completed it. The chances are he

23:19.946 --> 23:21.949
hasn't completed it. So you just have to check and 
double check.

23:30.941 --> 23:32.083
And as I mentioned, Although the executive vice 
president of a bank told me when I was getting in a

23:34.443 --> 23:44.213
small business that this is a real fine, small 
company. He had lots of contracts. And he knew

23:47.356 --> 23:51.240
doggone well that wasn't exactly true. That they 
were in the red. Yeah, they were in the red. And all

23:55.925 --> 24:01.951
he was trying to do is protect himself.

24:01.971 --> 24:04.433
And that type of dishonesty would not happen in the 
officer ranks. I don't think so, no. I don't. Well,

24:11.708 --> 24:23.063
it's probably a different situation because when 
you're talking to, communicating with officers,

24:11.708 --> 24:23.063
you're not dealing with finances. Sure, not 
dealing with money. You're not dealing with money

24:25.206 --> 24:30.153
or protection or loss of money. You're...

24:34.231 --> 24:42.763
you're really talking about efficiency of 
operations of an outfit or this type of thing. What

24:42.783 --> 24:57.364
about, oh, I don't know, backbiting to get ahead, 
stabbing another officer in the back so you can get

24:42.783 --> 24:57.364
a little leverage on getting that promotion 
before somebody else? Is there much of that in the

24:57.384 --> 24:59.126
service? Did you find? No, I don't. It's really not 
evident. It's really not evident.

25:13.139 --> 25:33.988
Because I think when you're a staff officer of 
General O'Donnell or you're a staff officer of

25:13.139 --> 25:33.988
General Burns, I think you have a lot of loyalty 
there that you don't...

25:13.139 --> 25:33.988
You just try to excel in your job and... and not try 
to downgrade somebody else's job. But there's a

25:38.915 --> 25:45.082
lot of competition between wings. One wing 
commander and another wing commander. But he

25:48.466 --> 25:51.229
doesn't say that Tex Hetherington is no good. He 
just says, I'm better. And I think this is

25:54.933 --> 26:03.503
different probably from civilian life. But you 
are, I said all you do is try to excel and I think that

26:05.542 --> 26:28.714
probably if you had it do over I would probably 
develop a little more positive

26:05.542 --> 26:28.714
promotion of telling them just like the going nine 
months without an accident. You announce this,

26:31.606 --> 26:44.222
you work at it, you accomplish it, and then when you 
have accomplished it, it's time and we're going to

26:31.606 --> 26:44.222
go six months, Then you invite all the commanders 
up and say, come on up, and we'll celebrate going

26:44.573 --> 26:53.766
six months without an accident. So you get 
everybody up there to look at your program, and

26:53.826 --> 27:01.457
then you kind of promote yourself that way. And you 
think if you would be, I mean, you would have

27:02.578 --> 27:06.464
promoted yourself now. Well, I mean, you would 
have. You would have promoted yourself more than

27:08.066 --> 27:09.949
you did. Well, there's a lot of opportunities 
where you could, have graphic charts and show as to

27:15.117 --> 27:23.429
what a good base you were running and things of this 
sort. Whereas you really didn't go out of your way

27:23.489 --> 27:33.283
to tell people what a good base you thought you had. 
And of course you learn that as you

27:34.746 --> 27:42.677
grow up. from your first command at the 350th Air 
Division on up. At that time, I should have

27:50.736 --> 27:54.041
promoted them. But at that time, you didn't get the 
competition between the bases and various

27:55.222 --> 28:09.103
activities

27:55.222 --> 28:09.103
to promote enthusiasm and things of this sort. 
Well, I think that you're taking over a base by

28:11.716 --> 28:19.773
taking over any organization. And I think this is a 
problem with even the U.S. government. We just

28:25.224 --> 28:29.934
criticize, criticize, criticize. And when I went 
to an in and there base, or an Air Division and took

28:33.299 --> 28:43.694
command of it, why then we just promoted, this is 
the best, this is the best, this is the best, and you

28:33.299 --> 28:43.694
just get everybody believing that you're the 
best. And when everybody believes they're the

28:43.714 --> 28:50.644
best, then you become the best. But when you get 
everybody criticizing and running down, why?

28:58.747 --> 29:02.811
This is a major problem, I think, in running 
government. I mean, the president. Everybody

29:03.852 --> 29:06.635
criticized the president. And instead of 
promoting the president, I mean, he has a

29:07.716 --> 29:25.815
fantastic job to do, and you just can't have all the 
backbiting, the media and the senators and

29:07.716 --> 29:25.815
everybody trying to get ahead. I don't know what 
the answer is, but But you have to develop your

29:28.953 --> 29:33.459
enthusiasm. And we're the best. And when you do 
that, why, you become the best. OK. We're going to

29:38.667 --> 29:44.014
talk about leadership this afternoon.

29:47.279 --> 29:50.223
Let's talk about one last thing this morning. And 
that is, of course, retirement, substantial

29:51.164 --> 29:55.270
change in your life. What were your thoughts? 
about your military career on the day that you

29:58.535 --> 30:02.240
retired. Do you remember? Well, you really get 
depressed. I'll agree. You really get depressed.

30:11.011 --> 30:15.036
When I retired, my— You were still on Hawaii now, 
right? No, no. Or did they fly you back for this? No,

30:17.479 --> 30:21.184
I was shipped back as a patient to Wilfrid Hall. And 
the Surgeon General was a friend of mine, so it was

30:22.345 --> 30:28.054
just one of those things that he could do. Although 
there's nothing wrong with me, I'd taken a

30:28.655 --> 30:41.877
physical at Andrews at Washington, and they 
didn't find anything wrong with me. So I didn't

30:42.618 --> 30:48.808
meet a board, a retirement board, because they 
didn't think it was necessary. And then a certain

30:49.328 --> 30:57.058
general said, well, he called me up and said, Tex, 
you would do another physical because you had to

30:49.328 --> 30:57.058
move the board. And they said you didn't need a 
board. So where do you would like to get another

30:59.741 --> 31:01.664
physical? And I said, well, I just want to go to 
Wilford Hall because those people know all about

31:01.744 --> 31:08.012
me. Maybe they'll find something wrong with me. I 
can get 10% disability or something, which is a tax

31:10.074 --> 31:15.741
break. And so he said, well, I'll owe you back as a 
patient. So he could do that. So I entered the

31:20.690 --> 31:35.738
hospital over there and then he evacuated me back 
as a patient although we came back to San Francisco

31:20.690 --> 31:35.738
and then we picked up a new automobile and drove and 
so I came back.
