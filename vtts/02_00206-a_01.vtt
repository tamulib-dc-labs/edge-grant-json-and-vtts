WEBVTT

00:03.018 --> 00:11.811
The 6th, and we're at 713 East 30th Street in the 
beautiful home. Paul Van Ryper and Paul, say a

00:12.332 --> 00:16.698
sentence and let's check. This is the old Cabot 
House, which is on the National Register of

00:16.779 --> 00:21.826
Historic Places. It's the oldest house of any size 
in the county. Okay, now... Paul, to introduce

00:27.453 --> 00:41.567
yourself to someone who may hear this tape or read 
the transcript many years from now, describe your

00:27.453 --> 00:41.567
background, where you grew up, where you went to 
college, and experience before you came to A&M.

00:43.329 --> 00:48.635
Okay, I was born in Indiana in La Porte. My father 
was school superintendent, which is a background

00:48.755 --> 00:56.903
I don't wish on people often. He was school 
superintendent my entire high school period. He

01:04.474 --> 01:09.558
was commissioned in World War I, and I never lived 
in the ports but a few months. He

01:10.139 --> 01:26.113
was commissioned to give, as a captain in what's 
called the sanitary corps, to give training to

01:10.139 --> 01:26.113
shell-shocked and insane soldiers, 
rehabilitation work in veteran's hospitals in

01:27.005 --> 01:54.835
New Jersey and Virginia then he came back to 
Indiana

01:27.005 --> 01:54.835
and became superintendent at Franklin Indiana 
and then Lebanon Indiana where I grew up he was

01:27.005 --> 01:54.835
superintendent there from 1922 to 1942 and I view 
Lebanon Indiana as my hometown and as a native

01:27.005 --> 01:54.835
Hoosier

02:02.037 --> 02:16.032
I went to high school in Lebanon,

02:02.037 --> 02:16.032
was lucky enough to be valedictorian, and got a 
full scholarship ride to DePaul. My father and

02:18.074 --> 02:25.722
uncle, who had gone to Franklin College, Indiana, 
did not like DePaul because of some football

02:18.074 --> 02:25.722
experiences. And my uncle, who was a corporation 
lawyer in Chicago, offered to pay the difference

02:25.762 --> 02:31.909
between what it would cost me to go to DePaul and 
anywhere else. He was definitely favoring

02:36.825 --> 02:43.393
Harley, which at that time I could have got in. 
Everybody was looking for students.

02:48.459 --> 02:51.042
This is 1934, the middle of the Depression.

02:54.225 --> 02:57.289
Well, that, of course, committed me to DePaul. So, 
I went to DePauw. I thought it was just about the

03:01.245 --> 03:03.587
right size. I had come from a high school which had a 
graduating class of 79, and I wasn't prepared for a

03:03.627 --> 03:12.677
big institution. I thoroughly enjoyed DePauw. I 
graduated as Phi Beta Kappa, major in history.

03:21.686 --> 03:26.972
I would have majored in political science, but 
didn't much care for the political science

03:21.686 --> 03:26.972
professors, so I had a minor in social studies. I 
applied then. I got interested in the University

03:32.836 --> 03:35.279
of Chicago. This is the heyday of Hutchins. The 
second. How big was DePaul? DePaul was about 1,200

03:39.944 --> 03:41.246
then. It's now something like 2,200 there about. 
It had been in the 20s up to about 1,500.

03:55.640 --> 04:06.354
So I got a half scholarship to Chicago and decided I 
was going to proceed and major in political

03:55.640 --> 04:06.354
science, which interested me. I might just as well 
have gone to graduate work. There was 20%

04:12.241 --> 04:17.428
unemployment at that time.

04:18.961 --> 04:27.432
In addition, the major source of employment was 
the public service, which was expanding rapidly,

04:18.961 --> 04:27.432
as you know. What year was that? I enter

04:29.335 --> 04:38.367
DePauw in 34, graduate 38. I enter Chicago the fall 
of 38. And I finish my doctor prelims. the summer of

04:48.458 --> 04:51.681
41.

04:54.144 --> 04:58.328
I'm working on my doctoral dissertation, and 
December 7 occurs. I have a very high draft number,

04:59.309 --> 05:08.719
8,500 or something like that, so I'm in no danger of 
being drafted immediately. But I, in 1939,

05:09.781 --> 05:15.006
applied for a reserve commission in the Army. It 
looked like things were coming to a head, so it

05:15.678 --> 05:25.332
didn't take

05:15.678 --> 05:25.332
great brains to figure that out. Well, the 
Quartermaster Corps was the only part of the Army I

05:25.833 --> 05:32.082
could get a commission in without having prior 
military service. So I often laughed at my

05:34.164 --> 05:37.589
background. My background for commission was the 
10 series of correspondence courses. including

05:43.488 --> 05:47.194
truck driving by correspondence, if you can 
imagine. At the University of Chicago, they did

05:48.116 --> 05:55.728
weekend military training for civilians. And 
they did a series of six weekends. I took that.

06:01.497 --> 06:03.601
Chicago also had a rifle range. And I qualified for 
an expert bad small bore. They didn't have caliber

06:07.387 --> 06:10.592
30. And on July 2, 1942, I was called up as a second 
lieutenant and sent to Fort Lee, Virginia. Let's

06:20.029 --> 06:22.151
back up just a second. How, where, under what 
circumstances did you hear about the happenings

06:22.172 --> 06:30.623
on December 7 in Pearl Harbor? Oh, I was living in a 
dormitory room on the campus. right across from

06:36.830 --> 06:41.858
the place where the atom bomb was begun. And at that 
time we were mad as hell because our squash courts

06:42.840 --> 06:50.512
had gone for reasons unknown. Did anybody, did you 
students know what was going on underneath the

06:51.273 --> 06:56.081
stadium? No, except classified. uh information 
and nobody was talking were there any graduate

06:58.244 --> 07:24.741
students that you all knew that were working on 
that project not that we were aware of so uh excuse

06:58.244 --> 07:24.741
me go ahead quite secretively uh as i say we were all 
furious because our best squash courts went and i

06:58.244 --> 07:24.741
played squash a great deal then My major professor 
at Chicago was Leonard White, who's considered

07:25.801 --> 07:36.916
the kind of founder of modern public 
administration. He did the first textbook in

07:36.936 --> 07:38.878
1926. He had just come back from three years as U.S. 
civil service commissioner.

07:47.590 --> 07:49.092
Probably I pointed to that at the suggestion of 
Charles Merriam, who was head of political

07:49.342 --> 07:58.294
science at Chicago for years and who was a personal 
friend of FDR's.

08:02.200 --> 08:04.363
Interesting backgrounds there.

08:11.953 --> 08:18.302
White encouraged me to get a commission. So I was 
called up before my doctoral dissertation was

08:18.772 --> 08:22.057
done. It was just as well I wasn't getting anywhere 
with it at that time and my mind was not. Now you had

08:27.204 --> 08:29.207
changed to political science. Yeah. How did that 
change come about? Well I had started in to be

08:32.872 --> 08:44.408
political science at DePaul but I didn't care for 
the faculty and I liked history anyways so I

08:32.872 --> 08:44.408
combined the two and my dissertation was the 
History of the United States Civil Service, which

08:44.911 --> 08:54.546
later I parlayed into a book, which was published 
finally in 1958. My dissertation, 1900 to 1940, I

08:55.547 --> 09:10.750
parlayed it back to 1789 and forward to the date of 
publication, 1958.

09:11.911 --> 09:13.292
I went in the military. I don't know how much you 
want a little bit, because it is relevant.

09:21.500 --> 09:33.691
I was sent to Fort Lee, Virginia, reported in, and I 
was assigned within a week to the 9th

09:21.500 --> 09:33.691
Quartermaster Training Regiment, which was 
black troops. Fort Lee had two black regiments and

09:33.711 --> 09:38.956
five white, plus the Quartermaster School. And I 
served for let's see, about 18 months as an officer

09:42.893 --> 10:02.303
in an all-black outfit except white officers, 
black negro that is, non-coms and enlisted men.

10:02.444 --> 10:04.206
Let's venture on that just a second. What kind of 
nomenclature, what What identifying words were

10:10.298 --> 10:19.129
used then by serious professionals like you to 
identify those men? At that time, we spoke about

10:19.930 --> 10:21.933
colored troops. And they accepted that? Yes, 
there was no... And basically, where were they

10:25.337 --> 10:29.582
from geographically? Primarily from the South. 
We had some from New York. who were not accustomed

10:37.045 --> 10:39.388
to going to the back of the bus. And there would be, 
periodically. This is Virginia. Virginia. Near

10:44.874 --> 10:47.256
Petersburg, Virginia, just outside. And you were 
a newcomer to the South. To the South. But I seemed

10:53.704 --> 10:56.887
to get on. So there was a tendency, if you got on with 
black troops, to keep you there. Well, I'd been

11:07.808 --> 11:18.660
there about 18 months, and I knew I was going to be, 
the officers were turning over and being sent to

11:07.808 --> 11:18.660
Europe. I had an interesting situation, very 
briefly. When I tell the Corps of Cadet students

11:27.169 --> 11:36.499
the promotion possibilities in wartime, I was a 
second lieutenant three months, a first

11:38.892 --> 11:50.869
lieutenant nine months and when I had to be a 
captain for over two years before major I thought

11:38.892 --> 11:50.869
that was a long time.

11:50.889 --> 12:04.528
And so I was a captain by the time the end of the 18 
months and our colonel had been the personnel

11:50.889 --> 12:04.528
director of

12:08.018 --> 12:10.420
I think one of the large meatpacking firms, 
anyway. He was W.W. Watson. And I went to him and

12:13.303 --> 12:19.169
said, if I go overseas, could you put me with a white 
unit for a change? He said, I'll try. Said, you've

12:20.911 --> 12:22.392
done very well for me. And so I went in April 44 with 
the 63rd Quartermaster Base Depot headquarters

12:23.173 --> 12:36.186
and headquarters company. it was 36 officers and 
118 enlisted men the top cadre for a quartermaster

12:36.925 --> 13:02.865
based depot when you had enough land to put one on 
and I was designated the purchasing and

12:36.925 --> 13:02.865
contracting officer and when the colonel said why 
that he said well I've I don't have any person in

13:03.706 --> 13:29.342
contracting officer you've had some enough 
education you ought to be able to learn it so I said

13:03.706 --> 13:29.342
all right this suits me and

13:03.706 --> 13:29.342
we were formed from people who already had their 
background for example we had the captain who was

13:03.706 --> 13:29.342
in charge of Cole had been the owner of a coal yard, 
this kind of background. It wasn't a military

13:34.657 --> 13:46.875
outfit, except our commanding officer was

13:34.657 --> 13:46.875
West Point,

13:34.657 --> 13:46.875
Colonel Harding. serial number 4204, which 
indicates his.

13:56.428 --> 13:59.452
So, yeah, we had four full colonels in the outfit. 
It was an outfit to run a large operation. Well, we

14:04.477 --> 14:16.390
set sail for England on June 19th on a French luxury 
liner that had been pulled out of Brest Harbor. to

14:17.500 --> 14:45.718
keep the Germans from getting it and then refitted 
for a troop ship and we sailed alone because we were

14:17.500 --> 14:45.718
faster than viewed as faster than the submarine so

14:17.500 --> 14:45.718
we got across to Liverpool without incident and 
spent a couple of weeks at the Seaforth barracks in

14:17.500 --> 14:45.718
Liverpool and then went for some depot training 
experience, sort of, to a

14:46.677 --> 15:02.852
general depot, the quartermaster part of it, in 
Burton-on-Trent.

15:02.872 --> 15:15.864
And they were losing their officers, so I became 
the S-3, the mansion training officer, for that

15:02.872 --> 15:15.864
for a couple of weeks, or three weeks. And then 
Prings were moving fast on the continent and on

15:17.288 --> 15:34.816
early, let's see, about August 9 or 10, we got on a 
train for Southampton. A day later, we went across

15:36.138 --> 15:39.564
to land on Normandy. Thank God it was in August, not 
in June.

15:45.385 --> 15:52.132
And we landed at, I never can remember whether Utah 
or Omaha, landed on Utah Beach, I think. One or the

15:53.313 --> 15:55.415
other, I'll have to look it up.

15:58.678 --> 16:01.922
Without any problem.

16:03.403 --> 16:09.289
We went over on a Belgian freighter, 
Leopoldville, which a month later was sunk in the

16:03.403 --> 16:09.289
channel. But there were, we went across and we all 
wore gas masks. the Germans have not broken

16:16.452 --> 16:45.852
through at St. Louis yet so we can hear the guns and 
so on although the US has air superiority there are

16:16.452 --> 16:45.852
no danger there's a flyover plane occasionally 
Midnight Charlie we called him who was obviously

16:16.452 --> 16:45.852
just kind of nobody fired at him let him look 
figured this would be discouraging enough to see

16:16.452 --> 16:45.852
how strength there was

16:47.536 --> 16:52.522
Well, we'd been there a few days when Patton broke 
through. And an interesting experience, which

16:54.124 --> 17:00.472
is, as far as I know, has not been written up. I 
thought I would do it sometime, and time's getting

17:00.593 --> 17:09.544
short, so I'll either do it for three days. we 
realized finally the beach command and we were as

17:10.553 --> 17:30.267
quartermaster we were helping assisting the 
beach command half at Utah and half at Omaha and I'm

17:10.553 --> 17:30.267
sorry and a few more back in Cherbourg the only full 
depot was at Cherbourg at that point it's the only

17:10.553 --> 17:30.267
place we had enough land to award quartermaster 
depot so for three days Patton commandeered all

17:31.327 --> 18:00.945
the trucks from the beach that had been bringing 
supplies and loaded them with gasoline and

17:31.327 --> 18:00.945
supplies and he took off with all the beach trucks 
or nearly all of them and

17:31.327 --> 18:00.945
the way things were logistically on the beach is at 
any one time there are anywhere from 200 to 400

17:31.327 --> 18:00.945
ships out there in the English Channel and the what 
we called ducts ductworks holding a ton and a half I

18:01.567 --> 18:27.405
guess about that I'd have to check that come up and 
the nets would put two net loads in a duct and it

18:01.567 --> 18:27.405
would come back on land the nets would be unloaded 
in piles they would be put on trucks and the trucks

18:28.060 --> 18:33.408
went to the interior depot. No trucks. The piles on 
the beach are getting to astronomical pyramidal

18:37.134 --> 18:56.143
proportions and the beach command doesn't know 
what to do and the problem is solved by one of our

18:37.134 --> 18:56.143
officers, Major Schaffner, who in Private Life 
was a photographer in Indianapolis, Dale

18:57.018 --> 19:02.126
Shockner. He said, look, can these ducks make it up 
the beach road?

19:11.219 --> 19:21.354
If they can, we lay out a depot right above

19:11.219 --> 19:21.354
and unload and sort there. And we don't have to use 
trucks to get the stuff off the beach. and whatever

19:26.600 --> 19:31.467
trucks can then come in to the upper part and be 
loaded. And sure enough, it worked.

19:37.055 --> 19:47.410
I was assigned with a sergeant to go up and lay out 
the stakes for the long runways that you send stuff

19:48.250 --> 20:17.278
down a roller conveyor and it's sorted out and all 
the beans here and all the potatoes there and all

19:48.250 --> 20:17.278
something else there and it had been mine 
presumably all the mines had been I discovered

19:48.250 --> 20:17.278
later that not all of them had done we I saw down at 
one field a mine exploded and knocked the track off

19:48.250 --> 20:17.278
a Caterpillar. But nevertheless, we went out and 
laid out and staked the thing, and this worked and

20:21.501 --> 20:29.933
worked fine. So I give Schaffner credit for that 
problem. I'll back up once further, because this

20:35.802 --> 20:42.131
hit us in Paris. Then we were wondering, where we 
were going to be sent. They're now land for more.

20:51.354 --> 20:53.856
And we were supposed to be sent to Metz.

20:56.559 --> 21:15.396
Well, it turns out that the group who were to go to 
Paris, who were much senior to us, General Rogers

20:56.559 --> 21:15.396
could not stand the colonel commanding the unit 
that was scheduled for Paris, and he sent them to

20:56.559 --> 21:15.396
Metz. and we got the Paris assignment. We were the 
youngest depot unit in the UK and we got the choice

21:17.660 --> 21:25.051
assignment by that accident. So we head for Paris 
on September 10th and set up the Quartermaster

21:25.071 --> 21:44.860
Depot in a French warehousing concern, 105

21:25.071 --> 21:44.860
Rue d'Aubervilliers in

21:47.742 --> 21:51.027
Oh, the working class suburb just north of Paris. 
Well, be that as it may. And

21:54.914 --> 22:13.243
in three weeks' time, we are supplying food,

21:54.914 --> 22:13.243
clothing, and gasoline to four field armies. This 
is where the Army military preplanned

22:13.763 --> 22:32.230
organizational system does things that private 
enterprise couldn't have done from scratch in six

22:13.763 --> 22:32.230
months.

22:33.712 --> 22:39.180
Within six weeks, we were from our little 
headquarters unit, we had 1,500 US military,

22:41.489 --> 22:56.493
about 2,000 French civilians and a battery of 
German PWs operating as an entity. We had one

22:58.416 --> 23:04.966
problem. We'd been there about three weeks when 
suddenly in the Paris rail cars, rail yards,

23:10.193 --> 23:18.084
there's no railroad around the coast. Everything 
comes into Paris and then has to go out from there.

23:21.368 --> 23:27.156
That's why we were so central to four field armies 
for about three months.

23:32.583 --> 23:38.952
Somebody sent 700 rail cars to us and 250 trucks all 
at once. We have 26 warehouses that can unload at

23:40.990 --> 23:49.663
any one time two cars or three trucks.

23:52.287 --> 24:06.829
Well, Quartermaster General sent down 
inspectors to find out what was going on and we were

23:52.287 --> 24:06.829
exonerated as all we did was to begin to unload 
things in between the tracks. and unloaded them in

24:07.467 --> 24:13.059
the streets and it was the suburbs of Reveille. 
Things in the streets. And as our colonel told the

24:15.449 --> 24:21.777
inspecting officer, do you want trucks unloaded 
or pretty warehousing? You can't have both right

24:21.797 --> 24:24.802
now. So the person who had done this was nothing 
less than Colonel Florsheim. What's his name?

24:32.332 --> 24:32.892
Florsheim. Florsheim Shoes. As in, oh, OK. The 
boss man of Florsheim Shoes who had done this to us.

24:38.740 --> 24:40.583
And he got reamed, I'm sure. Well. Here's what 
happened to the best laid supply plans.

24:50.730 --> 24:56.357
The ships that left New York were loaded 
carefully.

25:00.141 --> 25:05.908
What would have been easiest was to put all the 
beans in one ship and all the peas in another ship,

25:07.019 --> 25:12.146
but if you lost a ship, you lost the beans for the 
entire continent. So every ship had six or eight

25:14.009 --> 25:19.156
items. Now, here's what happened, you see. 
They're in a hurry on the beach. They put the nets

25:23.582 --> 25:26.085
into the hull. Here are the six and eight items 
around the nets. They're tossed in, and the nets

25:29.370 --> 25:32.454
are mixed. They are dumped on the beach. They are 
then sorted

25:36.618 --> 25:43.408
up on the beach. They're re-sorted. OK. So the 
trucks bring them in to the depot. And the 700

25:50.238 --> 25:55.285
trucks have to be, and the rail cars, all have to be 
dumped. and all resorted again. So there's no

26:01.647 --> 26:24.293
simple way to solve this, and our records were an 
absolute mess because we started the death pool

26:01.647 --> 26:24.293
without

26:01.647 --> 26:24.293
a full set of documentation files.

26:25.387 --> 26:37.461
We have things being tallied in by American 
soldiers, German PWs, French civilians, and what

26:25.387 --> 26:37.461
the hell they're tallying them in for, God only 
knows what the records show. I later became

26:37.582 --> 26:41.146
director of the supply division. First, I was 
moved from person and contracting officer to

26:43.168 --> 26:53.841
commanding officer of the depot supply company, 
which provided most of the warehousing. And I

26:54.597 --> 27:20.858
became major and director of the supply division, 
which was

26:54.597 --> 27:20.858
the things that are

26:54.597 --> 27:20.858
like civilian stuff, office supplies, paint, et 
cetera, and so on, plus food. I figured I had my

27:21.040 --> 27:26.244
records were good plus or minus fifty percent on 
any given item. It took me about a year to

27:26.324 --> 27:30.908
re-warehouse the whole place.

27:37.854 --> 27:50.845
Okay, as purchasing and contracting officer I 
wound up in charge of the produce for the American

27:37.854 --> 27:50.845
troops in the Paris area and for about a year I was 
buying price produce for approximately a quarter

27:51.297 --> 27:55.543
of a million men. It's an occupation I want nothing 
more to do with. You can lose your shirt. And I'm

28:00.009 --> 28:01.531
chuckling to myself. I can't imagine anything in 
your background prepared you for this. Nothing

28:07.159 --> 28:10.824
whatever, except a certain amount of 
flexibility. I hired three Frenchmen. We dealt

28:13.148 --> 28:17.794
with the Paris market through the French Ministry 
of Foods. The arrangements were interesting

28:18.348 --> 28:23.217
because we bought things on reverse land lease.

28:27.204 --> 28:30.129
The French government paid for whatever we 
bought. And we had a consignment in the Paris

28:31.110 --> 28:37.462
market of produce. France was quite 
self-sufficient in produce, in food of all kinds.

28:43.171 --> 28:48.558
The only things in short supply then were meat, 
butter, and eggs because Normandy was shot up.

28:48.818 --> 28:51.021
That was the meat, butter, and egg country. So I 
dealt with the Paris market and made friends. I had

28:57.849 --> 29:03.075
three assistants whom I kept in touch with for many 
years. One is still living. I just got a letter from

29:04.737 --> 29:07.040
him. I wanted Frenchmen who were without any 
possible taint of collaboration. So I hired

29:16.685 --> 29:24.993
William Duncan, who was the son of a Canadian 
soldier and a Frenchwoman in World War I. He'd

29:25.754 --> 29:35.624
lived in Canada for part of his life and had been in 
the resistance and

29:25.754 --> 29:35.624
he was totally bilingual, which was very helpful. 
And I hired Norman Pullen, who was the son of the

29:41.052 --> 29:51.126
British headmaster of the British school in Paris 
who'd been interned the entire war in Paris. And

29:51.747 --> 30:07.228
the third was Joseph Kertetz, a Hungarian Jew, 
whom I'm still friends with, who had managed to

29:51.747 --> 30:07.228
save both himself and his parents in Vichy, 
France.

30:10.448 --> 30:27.887
We gradually closed out the depot and I left in 
April 1946, came back and was discharged,

30:10.448 --> 30:27.887
remained in the reserve, and became a lieutenant 
colonel after a while. In Ithaca

30:28.047 --> 30:39.460
I was asked if I wanted to be executive officer of an 
infantry regiment and I thought Why the hell are

30:39.608 --> 30:44.034
you asking a quartermaster to be in charge of 
infantry? Well, I had in between 55 and 60 gone and

30:44.074 --> 30:54.348
done the command general staff course in 
Leavenworth and the reserve version. He said,

30:55.089 --> 30:59.355
you're the only one around who's done that. I said, 
give me a day or two to think about it, but I declined

30:59.504 --> 31:03.651
it. It was too much time. So my military career was 
in effect. I was in a reserve unit, a logistical

31:07.537 --> 31:22.501
unit, and enough to end up with a 15% military 
pension, which is useful. But the experience

31:23.843 --> 31:26.828
was... important I think in terms of my main field.
