WEBVTT

00:02.933 --> 00:07.300
June 15, 1999, my 42nd wedding anniversary. 
Perfect. And sitting in the beautiful living room

00:08.743 --> 00:17.057
with Dr. Wayne Hall, looking out on a cloudy 
morning. Now, let's see. Let's check and see if

00:19.120 --> 00:20.562
yours is working. Yeah, it indeed is cloudy today, 
but I think we'll have some sun before it's over. I

00:24.810 --> 00:25.370
suspect so. Now let's see.

00:30.322 --> 00:36.393
To a kind of review, you became vice president and 
dean of the college when? Well, to start with, my

00:36.453 --> 00:45.550
initial appointment under Earl Rutter was simply 
just dean of the graduate college. School first,

00:45.570 --> 00:49.056
then they changed it to college. But I soon found 
out that I was really carrying out the duties of the

00:49.036 --> 01:00.992
dean of the college more than I was of the graduate 
school, informally, no title given. Because Boyd

01:01.012 --> 01:09.424
Page, who had been dean of the college, had left to 
go to Iowa State University.

01:11.682 --> 01:18.450
I began to wonder how long that might persist or 
last, because I used to kid Mr. Rutter. He didn't

01:18.630 --> 01:22.274
care for some of my kiddies sometimes. He was 
always having me work three jobs for one price.

01:26.399 --> 01:34.028
Well, anyway, the initial appointment was as dean 
of the graduate college. I did not become the

01:35.577 --> 01:38.865
academic vice president. I never did officially 
become the dean of the college. We never did. That

01:43.297 --> 01:47.848
died with my time at A&M. But finally, I was able to 
convince him, along with many others, that he

01:49.381 --> 02:04.344
should have vice president for academic affairs, 
because A&M then was beginning to burgeon and grow

01:49.381 --> 02:04.344
and had many different activities than they had in 
the older days. So we convinced him. So he did

02:06.928 --> 02:14.680
appoint me dean of the, I mean, vice president for 
academic affairs. So your full title was Vice

02:14.660 --> 02:19.788
President of Academic Affairs and Dean of the 
Graduate College. Yeah, there's a little

02:19.808 --> 02:22.051
interesting anecdote about that. As soon as he was 
approved there, he said he was going to approve me

02:22.712 --> 02:27.198
as Vice President for Academic Affairs. I said, 
well, you want me to start looking now for Dean of

02:27.259 --> 02:31.825
the Graduate College? He said, no, I want you to be 
Dean Hall. So we just combined my former title with

02:35.050 --> 02:40.498
the new one, yeah. Do you remember when that was? I 
was trying to think. It was around 1960. I may be off

02:46.792 --> 02:48.355
a year or so. I should have brought in some of my 
notes. All right. The deans of the colleges then,

02:51.843 --> 02:58.217
excuse me, of the schools, were whom? And please 
describe them. Well, the first school to become a

03:03.528 --> 03:08.779
college was agriculture. That happened early in 
my, when I was dean of the graduate college. And the

03:14.892 --> 03:18.079
dean at that time was Gus Watkins. who was followed 
by Pat Patterson later, but that's digressing.

03:25.070 --> 03:27.634
Dean Benson, Fred Benson was dean of engineering. 
They were the two largest schools. Engineering

03:30.199 --> 03:35.427
later became a college, but not immediately.

03:35.407 --> 03:41.054
Veterinary medicine was a school for a number of 
years until about the mid-60s. Well, it was after

03:42.736 --> 03:46.280
the aspiration report was made. I proposed to Mr. 
Rutter we needed reorganization and establish

03:47.141 --> 03:56.672
some new schools and colleges more in line with 
what A&M was becoming. He agreed, and we split off

03:56.652 --> 04:10.807
arts and sciences into liberal arts and later 
education and the College of Science, which

03:56.652 --> 04:10.807
immediately was called the College of Science. 
Then there was a College of Geosciences formed,

04:11.808 --> 04:22.440
because A&M had always been strong in the 
geosciences, mostly the influence, I guess, of

04:11.808 --> 04:22.440
petroleum engineering originally. And 
architecture

04:23.315 --> 04:32.897
was the last to be split out as a school from 
engineering. Describe those four deans, that

04:33.799 --> 04:41.256
personality that you dealt with first. Well, the 
first dean of the school or college of liberal arts

04:42.063 --> 04:49.413
was Frank Hubert, who you know very well. You know 
his personality probably better than I do. But how

04:52.897 --> 04:55.140
was he to work with? Frank was always congenial and 
easy to work with. We never had a bit of difference.

05:02.770 --> 05:09.319
I sometimes thought Frank was a little lazy, but 
that was because I was a gung-ho young man at that

05:02.770 --> 05:09.319
time, I guess. that he let things take its own 
development, of course, but maybe that was the

05:09.299 --> 05:15.008
wisest thing in the long run. But he ran a good shop, 
and we gave him the choice later when we split out

05:16.311 --> 05:31.175
education, if he wanted to become dean of the 
college of education he could over liberal arts,

05:16.311 --> 05:31.175
and he did accept that. Did he give any reason why he 
made that choice? Oh, Earl Rudder, as well as

05:35.557 --> 05:41.247
myself, but I was to learn this. Earl knew it. He was 
strong in the field of education, well respected

05:42.909 --> 05:47.237
throughout. And we wanted to build up education, 
and we thought he would be the natural. But we gave

05:53.067 --> 05:55.070
him the only, he made up his own mind. We didn't 
force him to become dean of, because he enjoyed

05:55.110 --> 06:00.940
being dean of liberal arts, too. What about Benson 
in personality? Benson was probably the most

06:04.677 --> 06:15.234
capable dean that we've had at A&M, in my 
experience, in my lifetime. I mean, I'm sure there

06:15.294 --> 06:19.300
were other great ones.

06:21.929 --> 06:28.436
Benson was thoroughly dedicated to engineering, 
and he was willing to cooperate with others and to

06:21.929 --> 06:28.436
get things done. He was a doer, an achiever, and it 
sometimes took him longer than he wanted, and he

06:28.456 --> 06:37.305
became a little agitated as a result. But he and I 
always got along fine, because we were always on

06:37.786 --> 06:42.270
the same wavelength. I got along with the School of 
Engineering better than I did with some of my own

06:42.290 --> 06:51.700
former colleagues in the School of Agriculture or 
the College of Agriculture, because we saw things

06:52.034 --> 06:56.799
eye to eye, usually, is the reason.

06:56.859 --> 06:59.341
He was one of the deans that would speak up to Mr. 
Rutter. The two of us, I think, myself and he were

06:59.601 --> 07:04.586
the two that were not afraid a bit of Mr. Rutter. We 
would tell Mr. Rutter exactly what we thought, and

07:04.947 --> 07:10.592
I think he respected us for it. I've heard two or 
three examples of Benson speaking up. Do you

07:16.678 --> 07:18.700
recall any that you can share? Well, one you 
already are well aware of was when the Aspirations

07:20.755 --> 07:28.328
Report came out, and I guess Mr. Rudder, in Fred's 
presence, was complaining or bitching about the

07:28.408 --> 07:36.482
faculty didn't know what they wanted to make these 
recommendations. Fred said to me, I looked him

07:36.943 --> 07:39.427
right in the eye and I said, Mr. Rudder, if you 
didn't want the faculty involved, why did you

07:39.487 --> 07:43.995
agree to appoint them? Let them carry out what they 
recommend. And how do you think Mr. Rutter

07:48.793 --> 07:52.577
evaluated Benson? I think he thought highly of 
Fred, yes. He gave Fred pretty much the people Mr.

07:56.362 --> 08:02.229
Rutter trusted and had confidence in. He gave him a 
pretty free rein of doing. Of course, we all

08:04.672 --> 08:08.036
checked with him on major decisions. We never 
tried to run something by him without That

08:10.739 --> 08:13.243
wouldn't work well, would it? No. In fact, you were 
more apt to get it approved if you took it to him and

08:13.944 --> 08:20.733
discussed it in a rational way with him. Earl could 
be convinced about the merit of things. Did he meet

08:23.677 --> 08:26.722
regularly with you and the deans? Well, initially 
for the first year or so, when I was still just dean

08:27.783 --> 08:38.198
of the graduate school, and Dorsey McCrory was his 
administrative assistant. The three of us really

08:38.178 --> 08:40.922
ran A&M for about three years. No, there was 
nothing else. Well, I say we ran it, of course, with

08:42.405 --> 08:46.872
the board's approval of the future protocol. But I 
mean on campus. No, we didn't consult with the

08:48.855 --> 08:50.618
other deans. We just made up our mind what should be 
done and did it. And in those days, you could do it.

08:56.026 --> 08:59.612
You couldn't do it in modern times, no. No, but 
later I convinced Mr. Rutter that we should have a

08:59.592 --> 09:07.683
little more democratic way of administration. So 
we formed the Dean's Council. Mr. Rutter was the

09:10.527 --> 09:14.653
chair of it, and I would take it in his absence. We 
would meet weekly. Of course, sometimes it would

09:21.262 --> 09:26.950
go two and three weeks when Mr. Rutter was out of 
town or I was tied up or something. But I usually

09:26.930 --> 09:30.607
would take it over and run it in his absence. What 
are the kinds of topics that group would deal with?

09:33.882 --> 09:36.012
They were mostly academic. We didn't deal with 
political topics or how to do things or anything

09:37.156 --> 09:42.502
like that. It was just how to get your own job done in 
your own bailiwick. In other words, if you were in

09:46.927 --> 09:53.635
chemistry, how chemists should be performing. 
Did you all discuss new degree programs? Oh, yeah.

09:56.378 --> 10:02.505
The first five years I was just run ragged in 
developing new degree plans. Mr. Rutter and I

10:02.823 --> 10:13.501
spent more time over in Austin convincing the 
coordinator, the director of the coordinating

10:02.823 --> 10:13.501
board, who was somebody else before Jack was 
appointed. Incidentally, I don't know if you know

10:14.483 --> 10:18.811
the story of how Jack came to Texas or not. No, I'd 
love to hear that. Well, I knew Jack when we were

10:21.166 --> 10:24.173
both graduate deans. He was graduate dean for a 
number of years at Clemson, and we served on a

10:24.333 --> 10:29.685
number of committees together. We had a great high 
respect for each other. We liked each other. He was

10:33.774 --> 10:40.609
a very congenial person to get along with, in my 
opinion.

10:42.243 --> 10:46.412
I think it was Davies, Dr. Davies vacated the 
coordinating board. They were asking the

10:47.515 --> 10:53.989
university presidents or two university 
presidents to make recommendations for possible

10:47.515 --> 10:53.989
candidates. And I suggested to Mr. Rutter that I 
thought Jack Williams would make an excellent

10:54.931 --> 11:02.327
coordinator or director of the coordinating 
board. And that's the way his name got into the

11:02.307 --> 11:04.230
hopper. I had nothing to do with it after that. Oh 
my, I did not know that. Did not know that. Because I

11:11.904 --> 11:17.072
think it is almost as if somebody upstairs was 
planning it. In a way? The sequence of Rudder and

11:18.815 --> 11:21.480
then Williams. Well, Earl liked Jack, too. Of 
course, Jack had been a gung-ho Marine and had

11:25.005 --> 11:31.652
great respect for the military. And he was an 
outstanding Marine, too, as far as I remember his

11:31.692 --> 11:35.216
record. And Mr. Rutter respected that.

11:40.621 --> 11:47.648
In terms of creating new programs, do you remember 
any that you thought of as great victories? And do

11:47.808 --> 11:51.552
you remember any that didn't go the way you wanted 
them to go? Oh, there were both achievements and

11:52.932 --> 11:56.876
disappointments throughout. I

11:57.297 --> 12:10.511
think the reorganization into the schools and 
colleges, which still largely exist, was one of

11:57.297 --> 12:10.511
the real satisfactory achievements. And 
developing mainly not only all academic

12:11.672 --> 12:17.438
programs, but the new graduate programs. Because 
Mr. Rudder and I agreed early that A&M was never

12:18.060 --> 12:25.578
going to mount anything as a university unless we 
had an outstanding graduate and research

12:18.060 --> 12:25.578
program. That's where we put the emphasis in the 
early years. As a result, if you'll check the

12:29.046 --> 12:34.700
record, probably during my tenure there and Mr. 
Rudder's, I would say forty percent of the current

12:36.470 --> 12:40.915
programs were approved during that time. We were a 
frequent visitor over there trying to convince

12:41.676 --> 12:48.883
the people in the coordinating board and so forth 
to approve things. They almost would laugh that we

12:48.983 --> 12:54.029
were members of their staff. Do you remember any 
that they snuffed, they turned down? Initially,

13:01.462 --> 13:04.746
they would not approve a college of education. Mr. 
Rutter had to use some of his strong influence to

13:04.806 --> 13:11.092
finally get it approved, because they thought A&M 
did not. There was talk about law and medicine even

13:12.874 --> 13:19.682
in those days, but they turned a deaf ear to those in 
the early days. They still do, I guess, as far as law

13:20.362 --> 13:27.570
is concerned, except the venture down in Houston. 
And so the key lobbying in Austin was done by Mr.

13:27.550 --> 13:41.813
Rutter and by you and anybody else in those years, 
in the 60s? Whenever it was before the board for

13:41.833 --> 13:50.908
approval, we would usually, in fact we would 
always take the dean if they were available to

13:41.833 --> 13:50.908
help. to make the proposal and defend the request. 
Yeah, no, we worked not only on the Coordinating

13:54.672 --> 13:59.518
Board, but on key legislators, too. Bill 
Williams, not Bill Williams, Bill Moore, as you

14:00.579 --> 14:08.708
know, carried the ball here pretty much, directly 
working mostly with Mr. Rutter on it. Was there

14:09.329 --> 14:14.955
even an official A&M lobbyist in those days? No, 
not in those early years. Mr. Rutter did all of that

14:18.350 --> 14:19.872
himself. He wanted to handle the political 
matters, and he handled them very effectively, in

14:19.952 --> 14:26.841
my opinion, too. How responsive was John Connolly 
to A&M proposals? John liked Earl very much,

14:32.889 --> 14:35.813
because they were Politicians of the same kind of 
cloth, put it that way. And he used to kid their own

14:41.803 --> 14:50.015
and vice versa about the University of Texas 
versus A&M. He didn't want A&M to ever get its

14:50.455 --> 14:58.206
biggest University of Texas, or to be as 
outstanding and all this, but thought it was a

14:50.455 --> 14:58.206
good-natured banner. No, he would approve things 
after a while, but Mr. Rutter always did his

14:58.186 --> 15:07.041
homework very effectively. He would contact the 
key people that had the clout throughout the

15:07.462 --> 15:23.029
state, whether it was in Amarillo or in San Antonio 
or Houston or Dallas, wherever it was, and he would

15:07.462 --> 15:23.029
have his proponents lined up. came up for action, 
two or three, if nothing more, telephone calls

15:24.022 --> 15:33.957
from these key people would swing the vote when 
they were reluctant to do it initially. Were there

15:33.977 --> 15:38.523
key allies in the legislature other than Bill 
Moore? Well, yeah. Surprisingly, Swartz, even

15:40.686 --> 15:49.219
though he and Bill Moore didn't get along, Earl and 
I used to go down to cultivate Mr. to get him to vote

15:49.486 --> 15:52.870
on our side. There were others, I can't recall all 
the names right now, but some of them were former

15:53.751 --> 16:01.621
students and some were not. And Brownrick Dewey 
was our representative. Yeah, he was our long—I

16:05.265 --> 16:12.334
worked more with Mr. Dewey than Mr. Rutter did. He 
worked directly with Bill Moore. The only time I

16:15.170 --> 16:22.337
ever dealt with Bill Moore was when he was 
unavailable or he was out of town or something had

16:15.170 --> 16:22.337
to be done and he would ask me to go. But I'd have 
regular meetings with Brown. Oh yeah, we were, I

16:25.039 --> 16:30.845
started to say great buddies, we weren't quite 
that, but we were good friends. And he would do

16:31.786 --> 16:35.089
almost anything to get anything done for A&M. He 
was a great friend of ours too, although he's

16:35.449 --> 16:39.313
largely gone unheralded. He didn't get the press 
that Bill Moore got. Let's go through the

16:43.857 --> 16:49.777
aspirations and all that, the aspirations 
report. As far as you know, where did the idea

16:49.797 --> 16:56.820
originate for a kind of an, you started the other 
day Telling how it originated? With the Southern

16:59.174 --> 17:02.180
Association self-study. Yeah. That's really 
what prompted it, or at least that's the way I

17:02.700 --> 17:09.413
convinced Mr. Rutter that we should do our own 
personal study. Not only what was required for the

17:10.134 --> 17:18.049
accreditation, but where we really wanted to go 
and put it down and get key people to endorse it. If

17:18.029 --> 17:29.205
you and I both know, you don't get great ideas 
approved and endorsed unless you carry the votes

17:18.029 --> 17:29.205
for it when it's required. That's where the 
aspirations study came about. Of course, from

17:34.653 --> 17:38.158
that was the blueprint for progress, as we called 
it. Who selected the individual members of the

17:39.320 --> 17:44.948
aspirations committee? It was a combination of, 
well, we would get input from any number, but Mr.

17:46.463 --> 17:59.763
Rutter and I coordinated the input. Bill Barzak 
and I the other day were comparing notes, and

17:59.823 --> 18:06.092
neither of us knew how the two of us got on there. 
How? Well, that was through my intersection.

18:11.154 --> 18:12.856
Yeah, I recommended that. I mean, Mr. Rutter gave 
me almost free rein of appointing the internal

18:12.976 --> 18:17.200
members. How did you know that we existed then? 
This was before Bill and I had worked for you. Oh, I

18:21.944 --> 18:23.526
know. Yeah, Bill was my first assistant dean of the 
graduate college that I appointed. But wasn't

18:30.573 --> 18:33.936
this before he was the assistant dean? Was he 
already working for you then? Oh, yeah. I

18:40.573 --> 18:43.377
appointed him almost immediately. It was the 
first year I was graduate dean, Mr. Rutter. How did

18:47.443 --> 18:48.965
you identify him? Well, to be frank, Mr. Rutter 
wanted me to get somebody who was capable of

18:51.509 --> 18:57.578
writing. because he had a lot of writing 
assignments and he wanted somebody. Dorsey would

19:01.855 --> 19:08.461
do a lot of it, but Dorsey was not a real, he wasn't an 
English professor, but he was capable. So that's

19:08.502 --> 19:11.905
one reason, from English. And we both liked Bill 
when we interviewed him. I knew Bill from my

19:18.031 --> 19:22.536
professor days. I got acquainted with almost 
everybody throughout A&M when I was. Then

19:28.474 --> 19:41.385
as the aspirations report was being done, did 
anybody keep you informed about what it looked

19:28.474 --> 19:41.385
like was forthcoming? Yeah, I don't know if you 
recall all of the different committees and

19:42.395 --> 19:47.860
subcommittees and so forth. I know you attended a 
lot of them, and I tried to attend a lot, and Bill

19:49.862 --> 19:57.470
did, and Barczak, and oh, a number of other people. 
Mr. Rutter didn't personally attend any of the

19:57.590 --> 20:05.478
committee meetings that I ever recall, I mean the 
faculty or the on-campus committees. All right,

20:06.439 --> 20:07.980
now when we got through I had the impression that 
Mr. Rutter was a bit surprised by the breadth of the

20:08.602 --> 20:15.793
recommendations. Yeah, I think honestly now in 
reflection that Mr. Rutter thought we were trying

20:16.714 --> 20:27.370
to cut off too big a piece, a bigger piece than we 
could chew. which didn't turn out that way at all.

20:32.616 --> 20:39.124
But I convinced him, and unless you really dream 
and so forth, you're not going to have high goals to

20:32.616 --> 20:39.124
obtain. A lot of them will never probably reach, 
but you can't reach them unless you establish that

20:39.965 --> 20:46.653
that's where you want to go. Now, when the final 
report came in, do you think that his reservations

20:59.142 --> 21:06.840
were based upon the fact that he opposed some of 
them or that he was fearful simply that he couldn't

20:59.142 --> 21:06.840
bring them about. I think it was a combination of 
both factors Haskell started with. No, he didn't

21:13.482 --> 21:15.264
agree with everything. He thought the faculty was 
trying to seek too big a role for itself. Mr. Rutter

21:19.990 --> 21:27.438
was a strong authoritarian, as you well know, and 
believed in the power being at the top and

21:19.990 --> 21:27.438
descending downward. Well, he was a former 
general. That was his training, and that's what he

21:31.070 --> 21:33.712
did well at. And A&M was a military school when he 
came here. Still is, in a way. And for that era,

21:39.558 --> 21:42.841
thank goodness that he had some strength. Oh, 
yeah. There was Mr. Earls. Mr. Earls, I shouldn't

21:46.424 --> 21:48.186
say that. Mr. Rudder's tenacity and 
determination and bulldogging. A lot of these

21:55.913 --> 21:57.955
things would never come about. Was the board kept 
well aware of the way the aspirations report

21:58.559 --> 22:06.171
looked like it was going? Not initially, I don't 
think. Mr. Rutter was fearful. I didn't answer

22:11.499 --> 22:15.285
fully your last question. Not only did he think 
that the faculty had too high an aspiration and

22:15.265 --> 22:32.992
wanted too high a lofty goal for itself, but he 
thought that the board would never approve some of

22:15.265 --> 22:32.992
these old-time Aggies that were on the board with 
influence. Mr. Rudder was hesitant that they

22:33.332 --> 22:37.358
would ever endorse them. But he found out that most 
of them did eventually. But a lot of the board

22:41.841 --> 22:50.520
members and the politicians that had the clout, 
the political clout in the state, the people that

22:41.841 --> 22:50.520
did, thought the faculty would take its normal 
course anyway, as most faculty does. Mr. Rutter

22:58.936 --> 23:03.622
thought, as well as a lot of others, the role of the 
faculty was to teach. That was it. It wasn't to

23:06.325 --> 23:15.057
politic or to administrate or leave that up to the 
people that had the power of clout. Which board

23:15.644 --> 23:19.852
members, I think they were still called board of 
directors then. Yeah, they were. Which board

23:21.034 --> 23:29.990
members were most positive, and if you know, most 
negative about the Aspirations Report

23:21.034 --> 23:29.990
recommendations? Well, I don't want to do anybody 
injustice.

23:39.640 --> 23:49.809
I think Jimmy Aston was one of those that endorsed 
it quite well, and J. Harold Dunn from Amarillo was

23:39.640 --> 23:49.809
a great supporter of it. Pete Peterson, who had 
been on the board during that era, had some

23:51.671 --> 24:01.580
reservations, but he would do what Mr. Rutter 
would ask him to do. Sterling Evans initially had

24:03.301 --> 24:09.647
quite a few reservations, although he may say 
otherwise. But he eventually came around and was a

24:09.627 --> 24:14.014
full backer, yeah. But initially he had 
considerable reservations. Pat Zachary was one

24:18.801 --> 24:24.830
of the strong leaders at the time at San Antonio. 
And as long as engineering got a place in the sun,

24:25.851 --> 24:30.759
Pat would endorse the rest, usually. But you 
wanted to make sure the engineering group was

24:31.900 --> 24:36.968
taken care of first. Let's sidetrack on that. Is 
one of the consistent features of A&M down through

24:39.449 --> 24:52.434
the years the comparative rivalry for first place 
between engineers and ag leaders? I'm talking

24:53.115 --> 24:55.880
about first place here on the campus. Is that a kind 
of consistent part of the story? I think it is from

24:58.750 --> 25:04.600
the founding of A&M when initially that's what 
they were, agriculture and engineering. There

25:05.441 --> 25:06.904
was considerable rivalry. Agriculture took off 
first and probably had that leadership role for a

25:08.426 --> 25:15.157
while, and engineering caught up. But in what I 
call the modern era, engineering not only caught

25:20.266 --> 25:26.477
up, but probably was rivaling agriculture for a 
leading role. Fred Benson was a great person. Not

25:29.462 --> 25:39.861
only was he a strong leader of engineering, but he 
was a good man to cooperate in anything that was

25:29.462 --> 25:39.861
true academic

25:41.967 --> 25:53.703
And I'm assuming, too, this kind of reflected the 
change of the state of Texas from an

25:41.967 --> 25:53.703
agricultural-dominated state to now 
technologically-dominated. Yeah. Well,

25:54.464 --> 25:56.827
agriculture is still strong in the state. In fact, 
it's probably the leading agriculture school in

25:56.847 --> 26:00.052
the country yet. But it's much more modernized, as 
you know. It's more heavily science-based

26:03.136 --> 26:07.722
anymore than it was in the older days. Back to 
aspirations, do you remember any specific

26:07.702 --> 26:18.939
incidents that were kind of symbolic of what 
happened with the aspirations recommendations?

26:21.042 --> 26:22.144
What happened from them? Do you remember any 
specific events that helped to explain the

26:22.224 --> 26:33.321
eventual approval of the aspirations report 
recommendations? Well, I may be wrong, but this is

26:34.499 --> 26:39.009
my interpretation, which I'll state. I think they 
were approved and became successful because they

26:40.051 --> 26:44.581
were right for A&M. They were exactly right for 
A&M. That's what A&M should have. In fact, I used to

26:48.870 --> 26:52.558
yelp to Mr. Rutter in the early days. unless we 
establish where we want to go and really build

26:52.538 --> 26:59.229
this, you're never going to have a place in the sun. 
You'll probably lose out for all time. Well, and I

27:02.315 --> 27:07.864
agree, particularly looking back now, if we 
hadn't done it about then, We'd be so far behind.

27:09.728 --> 27:10.308
Oh, right. If we hadn't become coeducation and a 
number of other things, A&M would be a fourth-rate

27:10.929 --> 27:19.217
institution now. One of the recommendations that 
didn't get approved was the name change to Texas

27:20.138 --> 27:26.085
State University. Who came up with the 
abbreviation A&M as it is now? Well, as simple as

27:33.172 --> 27:37.817
just a name change might seem to some people, It 
actually took more time with Mr. Rutter and Dorsey

27:38.725 --> 27:49.517
McCrory and I on these evening long battles than 
any other subject initially. And then it had the

27:49.537 --> 27:56.525
same fate when it went to the dean's council, to the 
academic council, all along the way. People just

27:57.185 --> 27:59.628
couldn't agree on what the name should be. And 
finally, As I recall, I suggested that we call it

28:02.536 --> 28:06.324
university. Everybody agreed it had to be 
university. But what university? And I said,

28:10.934 --> 28:13.741
well, the heritage of the past is A&M. That stands 
for agriculture mechanical. Well, let's forget

28:15.625 --> 28:16.867
about it. Let's just put capital A without period, 
capital M without period. and call it, because we

28:21.554 --> 28:26.401
are in the state of Texas, Texas A&M University. 
Eventually, after a lot of harassment and

28:26.942 --> 28:32.531
disappointment, it was approved. Mr. Rudder 
didn't like it originally. He used to say, well,

28:34.674 --> 28:41.644
what does A&M without periods really stand for? 
Now, did he have a favorite, or do you remember? I'm

28:47.845 --> 28:49.127
trying to recall. He did at one time, although he 
was mostly more of a devil's advocate about names

28:49.207 --> 29:00.622
that were suggested and then suggesting them 
himself, as I recall. Dorsey McCroy just used to

29:01.023 --> 29:08.473
reel them off by the dozen in our personal 
discussions. In these private discussions of you

29:08.953 --> 29:15.422
and Mr. Rutter and or you and Dorsey and Mr. Rutter, 
Clearly, it was okay for people to say exactly what

29:16.178 --> 29:20.266
they thought. In other words, you could, in those 
discussions, you... Oh, I mean in our personal

29:21.909 --> 29:27.180
discussion? Yes. Oh, yeah. We often had quite 
heated debates, but nothing in anger. You're

29:34.114 --> 29:34.435
right. I mean, it was just forceful to... 
enthusiastic debate. Mr. Rutter wasn't afraid

29:38.599 --> 29:45.528
to say, you're crazy as hell. I would never say that 
to him. I used to try to convince him in a rational

29:50.294 --> 29:57.944
way what something that he wanted done wasn't 
feasible or shouldn't be done. Do you remember any

29:57.964 --> 30:02.269
examples of where he literally changed his mind? 
He started down this way and eventually ended up

30:02.289 --> 30:05.153
over here? Yeah, there was a number of things that 
came about that he initially was opposed to. He

30:11.473 --> 30:15.537
didn't want the name change to start with. He 
definitely didn't want coeducation, and he

30:16.738 --> 30:21.222
didn't want the voluntary corps. But he came to 
them. Admission requirements, did that, to

30:25.887 --> 30:34.515
gradually make those more restrictive, did that 
bother anybody? Initially, Mr. Rutter used to

30:36.385 --> 30:42.114
question me when I was saying, well, you've got to 
tighten the screws on a mission. I tried to

30:43.356 --> 30:52.730
convince him that high standards didn't turn 
students away, that sometimes low standards did,

30:43.356 --> 30:52.730
too low standards. And it took a while to convince 
him. In fact, he was concerned because enrollment

30:55.714 --> 31:02.865
was falling when he came here. it had to be beefed up 
or A&M wasn't gonna survive. That was as simple as

31:08.760 --> 31:09.987
that. And so he was concerned that we might turn 
students away. But I finally convinced him, and

31:15.422 --> 31:28.382
after showing him what was happening, that higher 
standards was the thing that would attract the

31:15.422 --> 31:28.382
outstanding students, along with the 
President's scholarships that we established.

31:28.402 --> 31:30.805
There's various versions how that got 
established. I've read them myself. But I can tell

31:32.468 --> 31:35.032
you frankly how it got established. Earl Rudder 
asked me to draw up the recommendations to form

31:35.052 --> 31:38.337
them.
