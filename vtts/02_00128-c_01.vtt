You know, what brings our students here, what 
makes our reputation what it is.

00:11.180 --> 00:24.577
But I think it would be the scholarship, a limited 
amount of research, and a certain amount to

00:11.180 --> 00:24.577
outstanding faculty, either as an incentive or an 
award or whatever. I'm not years or better at that

00:24.658 --> 00:31.827
than I am, but I would not object to doing that if I 
had that opportunity. Okay, last thing.

00:37.201 --> 00:39.103
Aggie story or two. Do you have a sad one, a poignant 
one, a true Aggie event? And then a funny one, goofy

00:46.713 --> 00:54.162
one

00:46.713 --> 00:54.162
from your experience anywhere. What are your 
favorite Aggie stories? I guess maybe let's say

00:57.806 --> 00:59.248
that.

01:02.688 --> 01:06.573
Well, I have one that's a shocker. But I probably 
turn that thing off. Let me tell you what. One of the

01:13.923 --> 01:19.951
funny ones that I remember, and this has to do with 
Ed Cooper. Ed Cooper was such a stickler for signs

01:24.912 --> 01:33.567
that were proper, you know, and he didn't really 
care for any kind of handmade signs. This was some

01:34.388 --> 01:38.275
years ago before we completely automated 
everything. He went over to the Coliseum and they

01:38.836 --> 01:44.085
were paying fees over there. and somebody had put a 
sign up on the door that just said, the doors were

01:44.673 --> 01:48.739
locked. Couldn't get in there and all the signs 
said, computer broke.

01:55.248 --> 02:02.498
And he came back to the office and he called me in 
there and he said, Lacey, he said, get that sign

01:55.248 --> 02:02.498
fixed. Well, he really wanted any of our doing to do 
it, but we got over there and took care of it because

02:02.518 --> 02:11.811
that was a funny story. Or go to the other extreme, a 
sad or a poignant

02:12.787 --> 02:20.556
one. A sad but a good one? Well, it can be good, yeah. 
I know, but good in terms of,

02:23.941 --> 02:32.150
does it necessarily have to deal with my tenure in 
the office? No, no, no, no. Just relating to A&M

02:34.033 --> 02:35.855
somehow. This goes back to my support of the Texas 
A&M adjunct. I think that was a wonderful program

02:43.060 --> 02:54.435
and I wish that maybe we don't need it today because 
the students are so better educated now. I taught

02:54.455 --> 03:01.424
for a summer out there between semesters here when 
I was in the math department. As you well know, the

03:01.444 --> 03:04.889
adjunct was put out there. This was one of General 
Rudder's projects that he got going with Kimball

03:04.909 --> 03:11.177
County, which is where Junction, Texas is 
located. And of course the most famous story about

03:11.933 --> 03:22.246
that is the Barry Bryant trip out there when he took 
all the football players and what, three buses

03:11.933 --> 03:22.246
went out and one came back or whatever it is. But a 
lot of students were sent out there in order to get

03:22.266 --> 03:41.670
the intense tutoring from faculty members that 
would help them become prepared for on campus in

03:22.266 --> 03:41.670
the fall. And

03:42.882 --> 03:53.594
my tenure in teaching was like five years. But this 
one student made it all worth my while and time. A

04:01.903 --> 04:05.547
kid by the name of Tommy Reagan. And he was from some 
little bitty small town between San Antonio and

04:11.907 --> 04:18.477
go to Lareda, down in that general area. And when we 
got Tommy at the adjunct, he could read 60 words a

04:20.400 --> 04:27.350
minute when he wanted to go to school. And he took a 
math class under me. And classes out there started

04:32.798 --> 04:40.750
at 7 o'clock in the morning and ran till like 2 in the 
afternoon. As a faculty member out there, you

04:41.067 --> 04:43.830
lived on the post. It was kind of like a military 
city. And you were, when you weren't in class, you

04:46.533 --> 04:54.641
were in a room where there was a help session being 
administered. And the students could come in from

04:54.661 --> 04:59.726
7 in the morning until 10 at night. Saturdays 
included. The only day we had off was Thursday. And

05:03.410 --> 05:05.853
Tommy was having a hard time. But he was there all of 
the time. All of the time. All of the time. And we

05:11.003 --> 05:24.762
actually, we being some of the other faculty out 
there, had to just make him go and do something

05:11.003 --> 05:24.762
besides stay in these help sessions as much as he 
did. Kid made it, got out of there just barely, came

05:26.745 --> 05:33.034
to this campus. Three years later, was in vet 
school. and is now a very, very successful

05:36.637 --> 05:48.731
veterinarian and large holder of real estate in 
Central Texas. Got a letter from his mother that

05:48.751 --> 05:54.037
was almost illegible. But the gist of it was, Dear 
Mr. Lacey, I just want to thank you for helping

05:55.798 --> 06:05.209
Tommy. I did not finish the second grade, and my 
husband did not ever go to school. And I am a postal

06:14.475 --> 06:22.807
clerk in this little bitty town, and I'm sorry I 
cannot remember. And the thing that you did for

06:22.827 --> 06:32.440
Tommy, we taught him how to use his hands, but you 
were able to teach him how

06:22.827 --> 06:32.440
to use his hands. And all of my associations, and 
education. That one. You know, that makes it work

06:40.047 --> 06:42.050
well. Oh, yes, yes, yes. That keeps you going. Oh, 
yes. That's splendid, isn't it? The other, I have

06:46.297 --> 06:48.300
one other if you want to hear it. Oh, yes. I had to 
revoke one diploma while I was at Texas A&M. This

06:55.651 --> 06:57.354
was a diploma that we had awarded. The book's all 
checked out to be correct. John Beckerman and I did

07:01.260 --> 07:02.922
it together. This man came in my office and he said, 
Mr. Lacey, he said, I'm on the police force in a town

07:04.825 --> 07:15.595
in North Texas. And he said, I have not been able to 
sleep for three years. Well, what's your problem?

07:23.283 --> 07:29.349
He said, well, you guys awarded me a diploma and I 
didn't learn

07:23.283 --> 07:29.349
it. I said, really? He said, yeah. He told me the 
circumstance. and I checked the records and what

07:34.272 --> 07:43.626
had happened was he had taken a chemistry course in 
another institution and had falsified the

07:34.272 --> 07:43.626
transcript as he came in here. He needed 
qualitative analysis here but he took

07:44.127 --> 07:55.124
quantitative there and he changed it so Beckham 
had given him the credit over in transfer. And he

07:55.144 --> 08:01.313
said, I just can't live with myself any longer. And 
so we revoked him. And two years later, he came back

08:03.820 --> 08:11.507
here and took that course, and we graduated. So 
that made me feel real good. And to finalize it, in

08:14.170 --> 08:21.657
all of my contacts, I had my students up there, and 
had to come to see me about problems. I only had one

08:21.677 --> 08:32.407
that I never could or didn't feel like when he left 
there that I had anywhere near satisfied him. He

08:32.427 --> 08:33.068
was still there. Still better than he was when he 
came in. I guess out of those numbers. Yeah. That's

08:41.376 --> 08:42.218
a good batting average. That's a good batting 
average, yeah. Let's quit with that. That's

08:44.623 --> 08:45.065
great. All right.
