00:06.680 --> 00:15.450
This reference system card file, I presume what 
this is something you developed over a long period

00:06.680 --> 00:15.450
of years. Many years. In fact, I, you asked me if I 
took it with me. I said the courage is because I had,

00:22.037 --> 00:28.144
I wrote so small. If a student wanted to read that, 
I'd have to read it for him. I used so many

00:31.928 --> 00:36.113
abbreviations and but mainly the reference where 
they could go to the library and get it. And those

00:41.766 --> 00:46.631
were published in mimeograph form and made 
available. Now, what is this that was published in

00:47.972 --> 00:50.275
mimeograph form? These cards. The cards, I see. 
The most significant ones. One was, well, I had

00:53.798 --> 01:04.328
some that weren't worth putting on there, like 
newspaper, reference to newspaper clipping.

01:04.865 --> 01:30.670
Sometimes you get into folklore stuff that way and 
hearsay evidence and I'd mark it whether it was

01:04.865 --> 01:30.670
research evidence or clinical evidence and 
because I found attorneys don't, they want that

01:04.865 --> 01:30.670
research material so I marked all those that way 
for my

01:31.392 --> 01:58.682
use so you uh your your reference would be to 
something in in in literature whether it be a

01:31.392 --> 01:58.682
journal article or a section of a book or something 
oh yes

01:31.392 --> 01:58.682
i take it you are continuing to add to your file yes i 
haven't kept it up as well as i should uh

02:03.708 --> 02:05.431
But every once in a while I find one. I use four by six 
index cards, plain, no ruling, just plain cards.

02:12.821 --> 02:26.402
Break them right on both sides, very small, and get 
the, you might say, an abstract of a sort.

02:26.422 --> 02:33.512
Because I'm advising students as to whether it 
would be worthwhile. run off, pick one by title,

02:33.644 --> 02:41.358
it'd be just a cull that would not be very 
desirable. And so I would code these as to whether

02:41.879 --> 02:55.163
they're good or excellent, or poor, and

02:41.879 --> 02:55.163
for a student's guide.

03:03.952 --> 03:16.345
Okay, the same story, I believe, said you had 
pioneered the development of electronics to

03:03.952 --> 03:16.345
amplify cardiac, respiratory, and peristaltic 
sounds. For what, would this be used during

03:18.367 --> 03:25.474
operations on animals or just in diagnosis? 
During classwork, Dr. George T. Eads, who's now

03:25.614 --> 03:32.862
head of Veterinary Science at the University of 
Florida, was the one who joined me in 36. He

03:36.103 --> 03:38.566
deserves a lot of credit for that. The two of us 
worked together. And we sought the advice of Dutch

03:42.472 --> 04:02.022
Dillingham and Electrical Engineering and 
others who might have had some experience with the

03:42.472 --> 04:02.022
old, with the radio station. on recorders and 
amplifiers, and we followed their advice in the

04:04.162 --> 04:15.992
sound systems.

04:18.354 --> 04:19.716
They were quality materials. However,

04:19.976 --> 04:28.984
we did not buy one of those tape recorders. Dutch 
advised us if we were going to buy. This was back in

04:33.608 --> 04:38.453
the late 30s, early 40s. He said the experience 
with the radio is that if you want a tape recorder,

04:40.795 --> 04:48.744
you better spend $1,000 for it and get a good one. He 
says a lot of them are just toys. So we never did get

04:52.988 --> 04:55.170
that one.

04:58.134 --> 05:03.379
So what, I mean, do you... We amplified sounds, 
oh... In swallowing, for example, and also in the

05:05.705 --> 05:15.257
voice box at the larynx, put it on the vocal cords. 
And having to swallow water, preferably a bottle

05:16.719 --> 05:30.137
of Coke, because you'd hear those bubbles, just 
like a boiler factory, so to speak. The little

05:30.317 --> 05:34.362
bubbles would pop in the stock, and you'd hear 
them. and

05:35.152 --> 05:51.913
students could get those sounds that they'd never 
heard before because of the lack of

05:35.152 --> 05:51.913
amplification.

05:56.199 --> 06:03.488
It was, they were very instructive tools and I went 
to Cornell for by two-week workshops on two

06:05.392 --> 06:08.475
occasions. And Dr. H. H. Dukes, who was head of 
Physiology at Cornell University,

06:10.077 --> 06:27.395
pioneered in the use of instruments, physical 
instruments and electronic instruments for

06:10.077 --> 06:27.395
teaching methods. I gained a great deal of 
knowledge from those workshops.

06:38.062 --> 06:40.946
Let me see if I can. If you had, say, an animal that 
you suspected had a respiratory ailment, you

06:41.627 --> 06:52.383
could then put the equipment on that animal and 
listen to the animal breathe. The whole class then

06:52.944 --> 06:54.526
can hear it. Oh, yes. As opposed to each one having 
to use a stethoscope to hear it individually. That

07:00.194 --> 07:01.837
is right. That's right. It would, that way then the 
whole class could hear it one time and hear the

07:03.880 --> 07:24.564
entire proceedings and then would be able to 
remember that sound and if they heard it again in

07:03.880 --> 07:24.564
another animal they could draw a comparison 
between the two cases then. Yes, there are

07:24.584 --> 07:31.052
different sounds in different animals, even in 
normal animals you get different sounds. It was a

07:33.091 --> 07:35.915
near experience for them, for us too. Is this, I 
take it, the same type of equipment is still being

07:38.639 --> 07:41.744
used? Oh yes, but to get more sophisticated 
equipment out there now and use physiographs

07:41.904 --> 08:00.651
which developed at Baylor University in Baylor 
Medical College in Houston. And we used to use the

08:01.660 --> 08:21.637
camographs, the old smoked, but put carbon, a 
layer of carbon on slick white paper, and then use

08:01.660 --> 08:21.637
writing points that would leave a white on black 
background. But there are a lot of objections to

08:23.319 --> 08:26.741
it. Some students would spend a lot of time 
smoking, and others would ruin it. and you can

08:31.917 --> 08:58.262
teach much more with a physiograph and you can work 
about five students to a physiograph and of course

08:31.917 --> 08:58.262
a lot of this electronics is push button work and 
you need somebody to keep them working but they

08:59.153 --> 09:03.378
have employees who take care of that.

09:07.763 --> 09:23.862
I guess more and more come to realize since I've 
been here that you use a lot of the same equipment

09:07.763 --> 09:23.862
and same techniques on animals as medical doctors 
do on humans. Well, there are some similarities,

09:25.175 --> 09:28.039
yes. Electrocardiograph and 
electroencephalograph.

09:36.211 --> 09:41.819
We use stethoscopes and we use other instruments, 
otoscopes for the ear. And

09:43.642 --> 09:54.017
quite a bit of it is, in fact, we've purchased some 
from medical supply houses.

10:02.620 --> 10:17.563
We

10:02.620 --> 10:17.563
talked a little bit earlier before we turned the 
machine on about the

10:02.620 --> 10:17.563
evolution of co-education at Texas A&M. Did the 
School of Vet Medicine have any girls prior to the

10:19.626 --> 10:28.560
undergraduate school here at A&M having girls?

10:31.544 --> 10:43.637
No, our first girl,

10:31.544 --> 10:43.637
I think graduated in 67, I believe. And then we had,

10:45.399 --> 10:58.733
Perhaps you graduated in 66, and then we had about 
four in 67.

11:01.598 --> 11:09.087
Now

11:01.598 --> 11:09.087
they have quite a few, around 30. That

11:09.327 --> 11:15.555
is in one class. So they're, what then, three 
classes? Is the vet medicine degree a three year?

11:26.236 --> 11:31.403
It's a three-year consisting of three semesters 
per year. So you have three classes going at one

11:32.184 --> 11:37.271
time per second and third year? First, second, and 
third years.

11:48.445 --> 11:55.855
What was the rationale behind switching vet 
medicine from a semester to the trimester basis?

12:02.838 --> 12:12.090
Greater utilization of equipment, time, and the 
employees were put on 12 months basis. Some of them

12:12.711 --> 12:15.375
had previously had been on nine months.

12:18.119 --> 12:30.415
And

12:18.119 --> 12:30.415
greater utilization of all equipment and 
manpower, both.

12:31.036 --> 12:49.742
fairly

12:31.036 --> 12:49.742
sophisticated

12:31.036 --> 12:49.742
complex of buildings and machinery over there, 
and if you were only on two semesters per year, you

12:31.036 --> 12:49.742
had a third of the year during which it basically 
stands idle.

12:52.525 --> 12:57.292
I think it's much better on a trimester than 
semester basis. When you were on a semester, was it

12:57.312 --> 13:00.216
then a four-year program? Yes, and then of course 
two years pre-vet and then four years veterinary

13:01.310 --> 13:07.218
medicine. Nine months each. Now how many years of 
pre-vet do you have?

13:17.213 --> 13:21.198
They don't have a pre-vet curriculum as such. They 
take

13:21.399 --> 13:30.051
68 credit hours and they are They're advised, they 
can take the pre-vet at other institutions, but

13:30.959 --> 13:38.466
they are advised to take certain courses, 
required courses. But of course some of them come

13:39.887 --> 13:46.413
to us with degrees, masters and even doctorates. 
And on an occasional doctorate would come, go

13:48.194 --> 14:00.645
through, but a number of them with bachelor 
degrees. But say if a student comes to Texas A&M

14:01.368 --> 14:13.163
with the intention ultimately of going to vet 
school, he would be an undergraduate probably

14:01.368 --> 14:13.163
what, three years? And then if he is fortunate to 
get into vet school? Well 68 hours, I think he could

14:17.269 --> 14:27.482
get that and possibly less if he goes to summer 
school, less than three years.

14:27.502 --> 14:28.523
So, Of that 68 hours, you say there's no 
prescribed... Yes, some prescribed courses,

14:33.191 --> 14:35.675
yes. What I'm saying is there's no real prescribed 
curriculum. There are required courses. Yes.

14:44.268 --> 14:45.089
About what percentage... It's more flexible that 
way rather than a

14:45.109 --> 14:53.842
prescribed pre-vet program. About what 
percentage of those 68 hours are required

14:53.862 --> 14:57.868
courses?

15:01.645 --> 15:26.455
all 68 I think now wait a minute they have might have 
several electives in there but they

15:01.645 --> 15:26.455
have to have 68 I don't recall now the required 
courses that have so many hours minimum of organic

15:01.645 --> 15:26.455
chemistry a minimum of Physics, I think eight 
hours of physics, and I think 10

15:27.970 --> 15:38.591
or 12 hours of chemistry, I believe. I don't recall 
now. But,

15:40.815 --> 15:47.548
and some animal science courses.

15:55.527 --> 15:59.815
At an earlier period, you had a prescribed 
two-year pre-vet course, I take it. Oh, yes. And

16:01.298 --> 16:09.154
then for those who were accepted to the vet school, 
another four years of drug medicine. That's

16:09.174 --> 16:09.875
right. The thing that makes it better for the 
student where the prescribed pre-vet, they'd

16:12.352 --> 16:15.535
take courses they wouldn't need. This way, they 
can apply most of these courses on other degree

16:15.575 --> 16:22.502
plans. So, in other words, there were probably a 
number of kids who went through pre-vet and then

16:23.403 --> 16:31.491
didn't get into the vet school. That's right.

16:38.337 --> 16:38.718
Excuse me a minute. Do you remember at what point 
this prescribed pre-vet curriculum was

16:41.815 --> 16:45.319
discontinued? Hasn't been too long. Two or three 
years. Two or three years, I see. I don't recall. So

16:53.769 --> 16:56.272
it was after you retired? Oh yes, that's right. Had 
there been some talk of discontinuing it before

16:59.316 --> 17:03.181
then? Not that I recall. But do you have any idea as 
to why it was discontinued? No, I don't. To help

17:13.276 --> 17:25.813
students save their time and so that they could 
apply that work on other degree plans if they

17:13.276 --> 17:25.813
weren't successful in getting in. I imagine now 
there's only a small percentage of those who apply

17:26.393 --> 17:30.739
who actually get in, is there not? I don't recall. 
Oh, a year or two ago, I talked to one of the members

17:33.190 --> 17:37.254
of the selection committee. One out of three or 
four or something like that would get in. So 25 to

17:42.539 --> 17:45.382
30% perhaps of those who applied get in. I don't 
recall how many applicants they had last year,

17:46.663 --> 17:51.367
between 300 and 400, something like that. I don't 
recall either. I have an acquaintance who teaches

17:52.308 --> 18:00.355
over there, and I talked with him about it, but I 
don't remember either.

18:05.279 --> 18:12.268
The article about which I spoke earlier, written 
at the time of your retirement, indicated you were

18:05.279 --> 18:12.268
the author of numerous technical publications. 
When you taught as many as 20 or more hours per week,

18:13.410 --> 18:19.177
how did you find time to do research and writing? 
I've been asked that question many times. I don't

18:21.521 --> 18:26.427
know. Did, obviously, or well, I mean it isn't 
obviously, I was wondering, I'm assuming that

18:27.031 --> 18:36.686
these articles are based to a certain extent upon 
research that you did. Some yes, some not. Some are

18:39.410 --> 18:41.834
just for meetings. These would be papers 
presented at meetings? Yeah, presented. But

18:46.381 --> 18:55.755
obviously you don't just dream that information 
that you pass out, that you include in the papers at

18:46.381 --> 18:55.755
a meeting. I have a bibliography. I presented one 
to the American Public Health Association in

18:59.370 --> 19:08.644
Kansas City. I had a bibliography of several 
hundred.

19:16.537 --> 19:21.405
I used several hundred references to write that 
paper.

19:23.731 --> 19:30.600
Well, I assume that that reference system which 
you devised and made available to students helped

19:23.731 --> 19:30.600
you somewhat when you sat down to do a paper. A great 
deal, yes. You

19:33.044 --> 19:42.477
could get almost immediate access to the 
technical literature and so forth. Were there any

19:45.080 --> 19:50.768
other people in vet medicine who had similar 
reference systems? I mean, I would assume that

19:52.418 --> 20:05.176
your reference system would primarily cover 
those areas of your responsibility rather than

19:52.418 --> 20:05.176
all aspects of vet medicine. Yes, I kept one solely 
on toxicology. In the early years, I had decided to

20:08.360 --> 20:13.527
keep one in physiology, one in pharmacology, one 
in toxicology. Those were the three cautious

20:13.547 --> 20:16.131
areas. I found it impossible to do. So then I 
restricted myself to toxicology. I mean, it was

20:22.260 --> 20:25.544
too much of a task to keep all three of them. That's 
right. We had good textbooks in physiology and

20:26.205 --> 20:36.920
fairly good, not as good in pharmacology as 
physiology, but when you have a good textbook to go

20:26.205 --> 20:36.920
by. But when you don't have a very good textbook, 
that means that you... I have to supplement this

20:43.178 --> 20:47.503
with a mimeograph material. In fact, I had the 
mimeograph material for toxicology. It was a

20:53.029 --> 20:57.594
little better than a ream of paper between 500 and 
600 pages. This was reproduced for each of the

20:59.797 --> 21:02.780
students? Yes. I had many calls for that. And 
finally, the budget forced me to restrict it to

21:06.464 --> 21:13.152
students who took the course. Were these calls 
from other campuses? Yes, not only, in other

21:17.082 --> 21:20.848
countries too. Well I can imagine that word gets 
around if you have something good. It got to be

21:24.494 --> 21:27.979
quite a task with me.

21:31.164 --> 21:33.448
I didn't even have my name on some of it. An 
instructor left here and went to another school

21:33.468 --> 21:39.477
and one of his co-workers used and gave him credit, 
and he denied it. He said, no, that credit should be

21:44.085 --> 21:48.472
to P.W. Burns at Texas A&M. He's the one who worked 
at it. Occasionally I put my name on some of it, some

21:55.822 --> 22:00.810
I wouldn't. It is work that is available to anyone 
if you worked it out. Yeah, yeah. I've done some

22:08.971 --> 22:14.319
bibliographical compiling in the past. It's an 
interesting chore, but it's a chore

22:14.379 --> 22:17.644
nevertheless. And errors, you have to be very 
careful of errors creeping in. Yes, you do.

22:26.858 --> 22:29.141
What types of things have you been doing since you 
retired?

22:32.727 --> 22:36.312
Oh, I did a little consulting work. didn't care too 
much about it because there were potential court

22:37.743 --> 22:42.889
cases. One of them did turn up in court. And 
sometimes I was pitted against former students,

22:46.773 --> 22:51.278
and I didn't like that. Sometimes I had former 
graduates on my side and some opposing, which is

22:52.519 --> 23:02.791
quite healthy, of course. But I disliked the 
nature. of the work that is controversial.

23:19.905 --> 23:30.161
This may be treading on dangerous ground here, and 
I realize that where there are potential court

23:19.905 --> 23:30.161
cases involved you can't go into a great detail, 
but what is the nature of your consulting?

23:31.643 --> 23:35.509
Poisons.

23:37.058 --> 23:44.885
poisons and poisonous plants.

23:45.165 --> 24:06.424
And then

23:45.165 --> 24:06.424
I haven't kept up with the literature in the last 
several years as well as I usually refer an inquiry

23:45.165 --> 24:06.424
to the department where I'm sure they've kept up 
with it much better in doing research work in those

23:45.165 --> 24:06.424
areas. So

24:10.133 --> 24:17.542
I enjoy manual labor now, have ever since I 
retired.

24:18.423 --> 24:27.674
While you were still on the faculty, did you ever do 
any work with the experiment station,

24:18.423 --> 24:27.674
agricultural experiment station? No, we didn't 
have a, we were not, they do have a connection now in

24:27.694 --> 24:37.947
the department, but not then.

24:40.863 --> 24:42.185
Okay. Have you done any consulting abroad, 
outside of the United States? No, not on

24:48.393 --> 24:50.356
consulting cases. I've corresponded with some.

24:56.284 --> 25:05.777
I was wondering, I sort of asked because so many of 
our retired faculty people have gone abroad on AID

24:56.284 --> 25:05.777
programs or something akin to that. Yes. No, I have 
not.

25:09.842 --> 25:10.363
Okay.
