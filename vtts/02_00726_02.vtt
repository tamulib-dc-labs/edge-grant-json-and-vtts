WEBVTT

00:03.625 --> 00:08.971
I have a lot of stuff to be found out. Our problems 
run from adoption of babies and alcoholism all the

00:09.172 --> 00:18.703
way through the alphabet, clear down the 
wheelchairs and things of that sort. Are most of

00:18.723 --> 00:20.505
your problems with the blacks? No. Blacks have 
Latin. I would say that approximately 60% were

00:24.229 --> 00:33.480
blacks, another 20% or so were Anglos, and another 
20% were Lesbians. Anglos. Where do you get most of

00:36.097 --> 00:37.659
your volunteers from? Housewives and retirees. 
Are the retirees good volunteers? Oh, yeah. Yeah,

00:46.710 --> 00:48.752
it's just remarkable. There's a man out here, he 
had a house that you could set this in his backyard.

00:56.301 --> 00:57.162
And two stories. And he must be, must have all the 
money that he's ever going to use and some more

00:57.763 --> 01:04.311
beside. and yet he is one of the best roadrunners we 
got. Call him up and he's out just out today on a

01:08.491 --> 01:32.543
little side street called Military Street up here 
in North Bryan taking a woman to a doctor and uh it

01:08.491 --> 01:32.543
runs all all the way from uh

01:08.491 --> 01:32.543
of course in people it it there's practically no no 
no stratification there they're all all retirees

01:33.755 --> 01:39.362
and whether they're just on call. One case that I 
thought was quite interesting was a boy who was

01:40.484 --> 01:51.458
graduating from Allen School. And he had a 
football scholarship to one of the colleges. And

01:58.708 --> 02:01.652
his mother was working. But she'd had an 
automobile accident. And she had fallen behind on

02:05.620 --> 02:11.827
his tuition. And he had to have his grades by a 
certain date to get his scholarship. And they

02:19.975 --> 02:24.380
would not release his grades until his tuition had 
been paid. And she had no car even to make a loan. And

02:32.210 --> 02:35.615
so she came to Bible what to do and how to do. And it 
was a case of talking to her employer a little bit.

02:43.968 --> 02:47.954
Yeah, he said, why didn't you come to me? He said, of 
course, I'll let her have the money and she could

02:47.974 --> 02:53.001
work it out out of her salary. So that was solved. 
But this Junior Museum, I'm treasurer of it.

03:02.618 --> 03:31.191
manage have a great many duties in connection with 
keeping it going like hammer and saw and and the

03:02.618 --> 03:31.191
screwdriver and things of that sort and I'm very 
fond of it because I think that we do instill into

03:02.618 --> 03:31.191
these kids some little bit of scientific 
knowledge and respect for their environment and

03:02.618 --> 03:31.191
respect for nature and I'm sure that in some cases 
We have pointed some of them to A&M, and they've

03:31.829 --> 03:43.401
gone, of course, plus their high school and all the 
other things they acquired. But we have helped

03:44.142 --> 04:01.279
them in ways, in their thinking, orient, and I'm 
hopeful or feel quite sure that sooner or later

03:44.142 --> 04:01.279
we'll have fed into A&M quite a number of the kids. 
with the museum with the youngsters way back

04:01.360 --> 04:20.413
before he had to go to the hospital because he got 
some cards from the little boys that he had helped

04:01.360 --> 04:20.413
them solve a problem of moving materials. I took a 
bunch of 10 kids, limited to 10, I wanted to be

04:27.162 --> 04:50.908
anywhere from 9 to 11 but I had one boy about 12 or 12 
and a half and we had a chunk of concrete out of a road

04:27.162 --> 04:50.908
but about as big as a fourth of this floor area, one 
chunk of concrete and the kids learned something

04:27.162 --> 04:50.908
about levers, block and tackle and ropes and 
hitches and We just moved that thing all over the

04:51.732 --> 04:53.855
area. We got it up on skids first, then we put 
rollers under it, we moved it around, and we

04:53.895 --> 05:07.491
determined its weight by calculation. I had 
another chunk of the same, broken off the same

05:07.511 --> 05:11.896
piece, so I determined its density. And having 
found the area and the thickness of the chunk, it

05:13.398 --> 05:19.445
had its volume. But if you have the volume and the 
density, you have the weight. So we calculated the

05:22.462 --> 05:25.465
weight of it, 1,970 pounds. We got that up on skids 
and rollers. That's a really marvelous practical

05:29.789 --> 05:31.951
experience. You can look at it in a textbook and it 
just doesn't quite... Yeah, and those kids had fun

05:32.131 --> 05:40.580
because we used two-by-sixes as levers, you know. 
And they'd get an end of that under there and first

05:41.821 --> 05:48.567
thing, they didn't have enough support under the 
fulcrum. So they learned something about that.

05:51.959 --> 05:55.804
Then they got too short a bite and they broke the 
two-for-six off. So they learned an awful lot of

05:55.825 --> 06:00.071
things about that. And then I took it up on a hill 
intentionally so that a couple of them could move

06:00.091 --> 06:11.327
it on rollers just by pulling on it. Up that hill, 
they couldn't begin to take it up that hill, so I got

06:11.687 --> 06:16.895
the block and tackled. And I had equivalent to 11 
lines up. 11, that's quite a lot of power, 11 times

06:20.933 --> 06:26.119
what you're pulling. And, uh... He went over to the 
hardware store and borrowed some gear. Oh, I got

06:32.066 --> 06:35.530
bummed. I needed to know how much we were pulling. 
So I got one of these scales they used for weighing

06:39.054 --> 06:44.420
bales of cotton, you know, about the 500 pounds. 
And I put that in the line so when the kids pulled, I

06:45.140 --> 06:49.185
knew how many pounds they were pulling. We rolled 
it up that hill, rolled it up that slope. It took

06:53.738 --> 06:57.163
every kid and all my block power to roll it up that 
hill. They could do it. They could do it, just could

06:58.505 --> 07:01.188
do it. They learned it, they learned an awful lot 
and she said I was sick and one of the boys sent me a

07:01.229 --> 07:11.123
get well card. I've talked to different classes on 
rocks and minerals and things like that. Yeah, in

07:18.851 --> 07:29.268
my petroleum engineering courses, geology was a 
very strong subject. In the early days of

07:29.428 --> 07:31.592
petroleum engineering, we did practically all of 
our geology on the surface, geology. So geology

07:35.778 --> 07:42.367
had to play an important part and of course it would 
not be complete without of course the mineralogy.

07:43.448 --> 07:48.114
So all the rest of my lifetime I've been gathering, 
collecting minerals and rocks and so on. Since

07:49.416 --> 07:55.864
I've retired I've got together the equipment for 
cutting and polishing and shaping and stuff of

07:49.416 --> 07:55.864
that sort. So that's the other thing that I do with 
it. You still collect? Oh yeah, collect all the

07:59.767 --> 08:01.069
time. You go out? Yeah, rock trips, I really, 
that's the real fun of it. We can get more people out

08:07.678 --> 08:11.303
on a rock trip than any place else, any other. 
Meetings, that's something else, but rock trips,

08:12.165 --> 08:17.092
that's something else. Could you tell me some of 
the people that are involved with your community

08:17.112 --> 08:26.605
council, some of the people that are doing the 
work, so we might have a record of it? Well, the

08:26.956 --> 08:31.223
retiring president was H. Hugh Island. He's head 
of the, what's now the Twin City Mission. He was,

08:34.247 --> 08:48.510
but the presidents have been, the first president 
was Bill Vance, who's now county judge, and

08:34.247 --> 08:48.510
then... How many people are on this council? Oh, 
there's about 12 or 15 in the board of directors.

08:54.399 --> 08:55.140
Are they appointed? Yeah, they're appointed. 
They're elected, rather, by the membership. The

09:00.764 --> 09:10.894
membership consists of the various 
organizations and the personnel of the various

09:00.764 --> 09:10.894
organizations and interested citizens. And we 
have a membership schedule of dues and so on, and

09:11.855 --> 09:23.828
the membership elects the directors, and the 
directors elect the officers. and

09:25.175 --> 09:49.056
the president was one of the leading people, one of 
the real starters, and the man that would be a real

09:25.175 --> 09:49.056
candidate for getting a lot of A&M history, 
because he's a guy that starts things. His name is

09:49.660 --> 09:50.861
H.G. Kanagy, and of course everybody calls him 
Andy because they were the famous Andy Kanagy,

09:50.902 --> 09:56.789
although he spells it differently. He spells it 
with a K. But Andy was the one who started an

09:56.809 --> 10:10.045
organization of social services, and it fell 
through, and that's what gave me the clue that it

09:56.809 --> 10:10.045
had to have some activity. So when we started the 
Braddock County Community Council, I said we've

10:11.287 --> 10:19.617
got to have some way to hold it together and some 
activity And that's the way it turned out because

10:20.407 --> 10:28.456
there was a few years there we had presidents that 
were absolutely uninterested in what we were

10:20.407 --> 10:28.456
doing. And the only thing that held it together was 
our activity, the information for a while. But

10:33.882 --> 10:35.163
Andy was a starter. Andy started action with Earl 
Rudder in connection with the A&M Retirees Club.

10:44.173 --> 10:48.237
He wrote the first letters and had the first 
communication with Earl Rudder. and Andy was one

10:48.925 --> 11:14.646
of the three starters in the community council, 
and he's one of these fellows that likes to start

10:48.925 --> 11:14.646
things and turn them over, and I like to think that 
Andy started the community council, but I kept it

10:48.925 --> 11:14.646
going, but

10:48.925 --> 11:14.646
then there was Bill Oxley, a preacher up here at the 
St. Thomas, Harold Wells, who was a preacher at the

11:15.757 --> 11:33.626
First Presbyterian Church, those were the 
presidents, and now we have another preacher,

11:15.757 --> 11:33.626
Frank Dietz, he's the Faith United Church of 
Christ down there on South College. But

11:35.009 --> 11:41.359
Felice Klein, a very able woman who had a 
counseling service in the Berisco building for a

11:42.233 --> 11:50.641
number of years. Now she's down at the Central 
Grimes Valley Mental Health. She was a very strong

11:56.145 --> 12:03.912
worker in the community council. Mrs. Topaz 
Hughes, Mrs. W. Frank Hughes,

12:10.820 --> 12:21.511
She's a very compassionate woman and she is 
actually what equivalent the almoner for the

12:10.820 --> 12:21.511
First Baptist Church downtown. She has a budget of 
$500 or so and if she overruns that budget, they

12:22.752 --> 12:31.482
still come up with additional money for her to use 
to help people out. Now she comes to my office every

12:31.602 --> 12:39.510
Tuesday and she for 20 years now, she's been 
running a clothes closet She has some money. A kid,

12:41.744 --> 12:48.050
a teacher finds a child coming to school 
improperly dressed. She writes a note to the

12:49.331 --> 12:57.037
principal, and the principal passes it on to Mrs. 
Hughes, and Mrs. Hughes calls the kid in and fits

12:49.331 --> 12:57.037
him up. At the beginning of the year, he has three 
pairs of new jeans. He has three sets of shirts and

13:00.440 --> 13:06.065
shorts, and he has a couple of outside shirts. He 
can start the school properly dressed, and people

13:06.266 --> 13:10.189
don't. can't tell him from somebody out here on the 
know because he's just as well dressed as they are

13:10.608 --> 13:38.286
and she has, this is new stuff, she also has an awful 
lot of used material for the children and even for

13:10.608 --> 13:38.286
some of the mothers and for 20 years now she's been 
handling this old clothing and the principal will

13:10.608 --> 13:38.286
say such and such kid needs clothing and She said, 
go send an auto when in the afternoon at 2 o'clock,

13:38.722 --> 13:53.558
and she measures his feet and fits him up with 
sneakers and socks and whatever he needs, sends

13:38.722 --> 13:53.558
him home with a big bundle of clothes. If someone 
comes in to you and they need to have the gas turned

13:53.579 --> 14:02.949
on and they can't pay the fee, and then you have Mrs. 
Hughes. Mrs. Hughes will pay for it out of her cash

14:02.989 --> 14:06.653
allowance. So she was the first secretary of 
Bradley County Community Council. She was a woman

14:12.689 --> 14:18.577
of great compassion and she knows everybody. 
She's taken a mother and two little children that

14:18.597 --> 14:30.153
were abandoned into her home or another place she 
found a... That's another woman. It was one woman

14:30.173 --> 14:35.661
that she found a place you got special rates in 
the... motel

14:36.620 --> 15:04.618
oh yeah we do that regularly we twist on you must be 
really quite a kind man by now yeah I don't take

14:36.620 --> 15:04.618
anything at face value he even got an ambulance to 
go and get a deathly sick man and bring him around to

14:36.620 --> 15:04.618
the doctor's back door so the doctor could get out 
and listen and assigned so he could get to an

15:05.358 --> 15:09.683
institution and be taken care of. His old fellow 
was bedridden and his wife was as old as he was and

15:10.183 --> 15:20.355
she wouldn't take care of him and the doctor 
wouldn't go 13 miles out in the country to see him

15:10.183 --> 15:20.355
for nothing. He could make $50 while he was going 
out in the country, you know. So I said, well, will

15:25.440 --> 15:27.723
you see him if I bring him in? He said, yeah. So I'd 
get the ambulance to go out and get him and bring him

15:31.244 --> 15:39.511
to the space behind the doctor's office, you know. 
He takes one look at him and he certifies it. He

15:41.533 --> 15:49.019
should be institutionalized and the welfare 
takes over and institutionalize them. But he went

15:49.039 --> 15:51.541
to the hospital and he died in about a month. There 
was one family that she called up and needed

15:52.282 --> 16:00.289
groceries and it was a Saturday and all the welfare 
people take Saturday off of course and so it was up

16:00.758 --> 16:30.040
to Bob and I went along with him to deliver the 
grocery and Mr. Island had given him a box that he

16:00.758 --> 16:30.040
could hardly manage to get up onto the porch he came 
out and he said that was just a case of real want and

16:00.758 --> 16:30.040
it was the man was lying there and he's little red 
spots on his cheeks and he had a can to spit into and I

16:30.391 --> 16:57.529
asked him whether he had any fever and he said a 
little and I said it's coming up in the afternoon

16:30.391 --> 16:57.529
before the evening yeah I said just cough much he 
said yeah got any medicine he said well I have one

16:30.391 --> 16:57.529
aspirin but I'm saving it and I said there's TB if I 
ever saw it so I alerted the TB and and they were real

16:30.391 --> 16:57.529
good about it I said you bring them in you take him to 
the doctor and we'll pay for it. So I took him to the

17:02.652 --> 17:07.798
doctor and he got x-rays and he didn't bother 
writing a report. He called up and he said, this

17:07.858 --> 17:10.642
man's got it. You better start taking care of him. 
From there on, they were real good. They took care

17:15.408 --> 17:16.549
of everything. Got him the clothing. They got him a 
lot of clothing and then they went through the

17:17.550 --> 17:24.278
family and the whole family got moved out to 
Temple. They all had... Over east of here. I've had

17:29.808 --> 17:34.312
a whole family in a TB sanitarium for a little bit. 
But those are things that happen. There is need.

17:37.195 --> 17:40.698
There's a real satisfaction about it too. There is 
a great deal of need and there is a need for some

17:40.718 --> 17:52.549
place where people can come and have somebody try 
to do something about it. A woman in this morning,

17:55.191 --> 17:59.055
she has kidney trouble. occasional complete 
kidney blockage. She has to go to John Seeley

18:02.739 --> 18:06.904
Hospital in Galveston. We sent her down last week 
and they gave her some medicine, sent her home and

18:08.166 --> 18:13.873
said come back on the 3rd of July. So we get a charity 
rate from the bus company and I got the Salvation

18:13.913 --> 18:24.486
Army to buy her her bus ticket There's a round trip 
ticket for $11.10 galveston. So

18:29.345 --> 18:33.472
I arranged that. That's the only thing I did this 
morning is arrange that. Of course I am working on

18:36.878 --> 18:50.001
our number four directory now and then the- Well 
isn't she the one you usually made long-distance

18:36.878 --> 18:50.001
calls to the hospital so she could get in the last 
time she went? Well that was a couple months ago. A

18:54.547 --> 19:11.324
little over a month ago that she had a kidney 
stoppage and I called Galveston from the house

18:54.547 --> 19:11.324
here on Saturday afternoon and somebody 
furnished her transportation and she got that

18:54.547 --> 19:11.324
right down there and they took her in but then they 
turned her loose again. Looks like she's gonna

19:12.886 --> 19:14.728
have to have an operation. They've been fighting 
it off.

19:21.740 --> 19:24.364
I guess that's, that tells the story. We did a lot of 
traveling and we like, each year we like to do a

19:24.404 --> 19:29.752
little traveling. We were, two years ago we went 
down through Africa, went up through Africa

19:29.772 --> 19:43.013
rather, and

19:29.772 --> 19:43.013
last year we were in Hawaii for a couple of weeks. We 
just like to haul off and go, but in the meantime we

19:51.068 --> 19:53.892
look after these things are of interest to us. They 
have three sons and eleven grandchildren. The

19:59.380 --> 20:12.499
oldest is a mechanical engineer or industrial 
engineer with a

19:59.380 --> 20:12.499
command company. They've started out making 
helicopters. They don't make many of them. They

20:17.146 --> 20:18.308
make parts for a lot of aviation parts, 
subcontracts, aviation parts, and then our

20:19.132 --> 20:45.493
middle son is an electrical engineer, and he works 
at Bell in Buffalo, and our third son is a petroleum

20:19.132 --> 20:45.493
engineer, and you'll hold it against me, but he 
graduated from the University of Texas. That was

20:46.132 --> 20:54.287
in 1950 though before I came down here, but he's 
with the Imperial Oil Company in Alberta in

20:46.132 --> 20:54.287
Canada. Did he ever give you a hard time about 
coming here? No, he's, once in a while he says, why

20:57.053 --> 21:09.456
didn't we ever come to, because we tried to do a 
pretty good job of investigating all of the

20:57.053 --> 21:09.456
petroleum schools. It was because of Dr. Fancher. 
The same Dr. Fancher that I mentioned. He was over

21:13.856 --> 21:16.299
there and Tori and the rest of them. I thought that 
that was about as good a school as it was at the time

21:17.280 --> 21:26.132
but I'm convinced now that A&M is a better 
petroleum school. Well, thank you.
