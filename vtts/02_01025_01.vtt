00:01.786 --> 00:08.115
Altsuarez by Linda Mendez from December 4th, 1988 
at my home in Houston concerning the Vietnam War.

00:08.515 --> 00:15.665
In the interest of accumulating knowledge about 
the war, I am going to donate this tape to the Texas

00:08.515 --> 00:15.665
A&M Oral History Collection in the University 
Archives. Is this all right with you? The answer

00:18.148 --> 00:19.050
was yes. What is your date and place of birth? He was 
born on February 25th, 1950.

00:31.182 --> 00:32.423
born here in Houston, Texas. What type of 
education did you have prior to going into

00:33.425 --> 00:39.512
Vietnam? Prior to going to Vietnam, a high school 
diploma and one year at San Jacinto Junior

00:39.552 --> 00:49.484
College. How and why did you join the military? 
Well, I joined the military for basically two

00:55.190 --> 00:58.354
reasons. Number one, I wasn't doing too well in 
school. I didn't maintain a B average, which

01:01.329 --> 01:13.301
essentially at that particular time meant that 
you were more prone to getting drafted, and I felt

01:01.329 --> 01:13.301
that my time would be coming up soon.

01:16.424 --> 01:25.793
Basically,

01:16.424 --> 01:25.793
I felt like a change was needed, and so I made the 
attempt to at least talk with the enlisted people

01:26.482 --> 01:29.685
with the United States Air Force. They, in turn, 
were very much interested. But luckily, for an

01:35.331 --> 01:54.531
unknown reason, a cousin of mine who had just 
returned from Vietnam happened to talk with me

01:35.331 --> 01:54.531
about that subject and really gave me a strong 
impression that maybe two years of induction

01:35.331 --> 01:54.531
would be more beneficial to me. at which point then 
I did go directly to the Selective Service and then

01:54.848 --> 02:06.143
request for induction as a draftee, that they 
would send me and immediately induct me. I don't

02:08.205 --> 02:18.539
regret doing that, it's just that I felt somewhere 
along the line that I really needed to find my

02:08.205 --> 02:18.539
future and myself, and I so chose to do that. 
Dealing with the Selective Service, did you

02:19.940 --> 02:23.505
notice any kind of, While you being there, did you 
notice any prejudices towards other people?

02:30.065 --> 02:37.374
Like, for instance, didn't they had to judge you on 
whether or not they chose people to go to Vietnam?

02:37.915 --> 02:39.356
Did you notice any kind of? Well, during the 
induction period, one thing I did notice, you

02:39.737 --> 02:51.771
didn't find too many upper class individuals. 
were very few college students. You could tell

02:53.953 --> 03:00.082
simply by the way that they talked that they were 
more educated than the ones that were around me.

03:00.783 --> 03:09.475
Very many blacks, very many of the people like me, 
18 and 19 year olds were there. And I really didn't

03:09.496 --> 03:18.829
see anybody that to me looked outstanding as far as 
looking on the upper echelons of society. This was

03:19.330 --> 03:20.712
strictly an induction of the lower spectrum of 
society, at least that's from my point of view.

03:29.823 --> 03:33.007
Where were you stationed during your tour of duty 
and what was your job? Are you referring to the

03:35.571 --> 03:40.038
processes of what I went through? Upon the 
induction date that evening, I took a long bus ride

03:41.380 --> 03:48.370
to Fort Polk, Louisiana, to which I began my boot 
training. and I stayed eight weeks there before

03:48.788 --> 03:58.344
going on to advance individual training at Fort 
Sam Houston in San Antonio. There I stayed a total

03:58.725 --> 04:09.884
of ten weeks before actually getting a permanent 
assigned duty at Fort Leonard Wood Army General

03:58.725 --> 04:09.884
Hospital in Leonard Wood, Missouri. Is all this 
Like, is this all, when you first joined, is this

04:14.573 --> 04:19.198
all you did right before you went into Vietnam? I 
mean, is this like, this would be your military

04:19.458 --> 04:22.722
career before Vietnam? Right, prior to going, 
right. Okay. And when you went, when you finally

04:25.285 --> 04:35.656
got to Vietnam, did you feel that the training that 
you had was going to be sufficient, or did you have

04:25.285 --> 04:35.656
any idea what was going to be expected of you? Well, 
I was, yeah, I was fortunate. in the sense that when

04:38.570 --> 04:46.162
I was assigned my permanent duty at Leonard Wood 
Army General Hospital, I was assigned

04:38.570 --> 04:46.162
specifically to the emergency room. That in 
itself brought on a new change in my attitudes

04:46.182 --> 04:50.229
toward life. I began to see so much.

04:55.938 --> 05:04.392
It's really strange, you know, from a kid that used 
to wake up and play baseball from 8 o'clock in the

04:55.938 --> 05:04.392
morning at the local park with all the rest of the 
gang until about 9.30 at night, you know, that was

05:04.827 --> 05:33.079
the bulk of my summer activities a lot, just 
playing ball and enjoying being with my local

05:04.827 --> 05:33.079
friends, to having to work in an emergency room 
where little kids come in,

05:04.827 --> 05:33.079
not being able to breathe, accident cases, just a 
whole range of things that occur inside an

05:04.827 --> 05:33.079
emergency room of a major hospital. in a major area 
in Leonardwood. It's actually in between Rolla,

05:36.083 --> 05:43.573
Missouri and Springfield, Missouri, in a stretch 
of road, probably one of the most dangerous of all

05:36.083 --> 05:43.573
the country. The hills of the Ozark Mountains 
there caused a lot of fatalities. And having been

05:48.941 --> 05:52.807
stationed there, I did a lot of ambulance runs. I 
did a lot of work there on trauma cases. And that in

05:56.492 --> 06:03.302
itself gave me a much more controlling factor on my 
part of knowing that I could, if engaged in combat,

06:03.788 --> 06:13.725
be able to or feel confident enough that I could be 
able to conduct myself and work and potentially

06:03.788 --> 06:13.725
save lives. Basically, I felt very strong that if 
it wasn't for that, I wouldn't have felt that I was

06:13.906 --> 06:25.506
capable of being able to control myself in 
Vietnam. Okay. Before you went to Vietnam,

06:30.248 --> 06:39.280
whatever you visualized of it being like, or what 
did you visualize Vietnam being like? Prior to

06:39.300 --> 06:39.821
going? Well, I was like most other Americans. Six 
o'clock news, that's all you saw. Luckily, I

06:45.528 --> 06:50.995
didn't have any cousins that were there or 
somebody close. I had friends that I went to school

06:51.916 --> 06:59.226
with, one in particular that passed away, that I 
found out had died in Vietnam. It was really

07:00.033 --> 07:09.385
strange to visually think about him, because a 
year had passed by before I realized that

07:00.033 --> 07:09.385
something had happened to him. I don't really know 
how many of my fellow students went to Vietnam. I

07:14.712 --> 07:17.415
really haven't just tried to even inquire. But

07:17.456 --> 07:25.566
just basically, like most Americans, we didn't 
really know what was going on. And that was part of

07:25.606 --> 07:28.690
my curiosity about wanting to go there, too. And as 
during the time period that things were beginning

07:30.087 --> 07:59.571
to happen at Leonardwood,

07:30.087 --> 07:59.571
in the sense of getting bored, getting into 
trouble in the sense of getting into trouble and

07:30.087 --> 07:59.571
the fact that in one particular incident I yelled 
at Lieutenant Colonel and could have probably

07:30.087 --> 07:59.571
gotten a court martial except that the surgeon 
general of the hospital backed me up and saying

07:59.888 --> 08:27.583
that I was corrected when I was doing and that made 
me feel good but at the same time I felt that it was

07:59.888 --> 08:27.583
just coming to a boiling point and just being 
someplace and doing the emergency work there

07:59.888 --> 08:27.583
working 14 sometimes 16 hours a day and all that 
just came into play the stress there came into play

07:59.888 --> 08:27.583
and when I get rather I received orders to go to 
Germany but then I went back to personnel and told

07:59.888 --> 08:27.583
them hey No, that's not what I really want. I 
cannot, I do not feel like I want to find another

08:29.981 --> 08:36.250
Leonard Wood in Missouri, you know, in Germany. So 
then I suggested that Vietnam would probably be

08:37.131 --> 08:48.968
the best place for me to go and I felt that I acquired 
enough knowledge or at least felt strong enough

08:37.131 --> 08:48.968
that I could do my job there or I could do a job there. 
But I didn't know much about Vietnam other than

08:50.210 --> 08:57.621
from what I'd heard from the fellow workers and I 
didn't feel like it would be that much different,

08:58.529 --> 09:00.531
really. So you didn't feel like there was a 
difference between, say, the land itself? You had

09:05.697 --> 09:07.759
just no idea what it was like? Well, here again, 
you're right. I have no idea what the jungle is like

09:11.022 --> 09:15.768
or what the different areas are like. But if it was 
going to be jungle, I remember the days when my dad

09:17.009 --> 09:26.359
would talk to me about fighting in the islands, the 
island hopping that he did. in World War II in the

09:26.896 --> 09:32.061
Pacific, and I felt like that was enough for me. I 
think I could do just as well. Did you think that

09:34.664 --> 09:39.849
Vietnam was going to be anything like the previous 
wars, like World War II? Oh, no. That was something

09:41.691 --> 09:53.883
that, in talking with many returning Vietnam 
individuals at the military base in Leonardwood,

09:41.691 --> 09:53.883
that it wasn't like that. But at the same time, I had 
to see it. Having been in Missouri long enough, I

09:56.815 --> 10:04.563
learned to acquire that seeing and believing is 
something you need to do. Show me. Did you know or

10:06.805 --> 10:11.990
understand the reason that the United States was 
in Vietnam? At that particular time, no. Did you

10:15.914 --> 10:17.356
have any kind of, what was your... I didn't really, 
to me, at that particular time period, I was more

10:17.396 --> 10:24.443
concerned with developing my own life than the 
real issue. It took many years later before I began

10:25.418 --> 10:38.194
to understand and to acquire enough knowledge as 
to why the domino theory was so strong and why we

10:25.418 --> 10:38.194
were there, basically. Going in, did you believe 
anything about the domino theory? That didn't

10:42.819 --> 10:44.601
really interest me too much. I was among so many 
people my age, so many people that were like me in

10:44.721 --> 10:55.054
the era, that time period. the real military 
strategy just didn't really affect anybody. We

10:58.773 --> 11:05.903
were there simply because we were there, either 
because we wanted to be there or because we just

10:58.773 --> 11:05.903
accepted the orders. We didn't rebel. We were just 
there, you know, and the job that needed to be done,

11:06.664 --> 11:13.493
we felt like, well, we're here, so we'll just go 
ahead and get it done. What about the Vietnamese

11:14.334 --> 11:17.018
people? Did you have any idea, anything about 
their culture? No, no. I had no idea what what these

11:24.548 --> 11:25.809
people were like. They, to me, were peasants in the 
sense of the country that they lived in. They were

11:31.056 --> 11:31.877
farmers. But as far as knowing them or knowing what 
was to be expected, I really didn't. The only

11:42.709 --> 11:50.218
indoctrination we got was about an hour of 
Vietnamese culture, which didn't really say

11:42.709 --> 11:50.218
anything. Technically, we were not really, and I 
don't think there was anybody in the military that

11:51.346 --> 12:03.282
was really trained for the type of conditions we 
were going to go into and the reasons for why we were

11:51.346 --> 12:03.282
there. We just had to accept the orders. Okay. 
About the tour of duty, how did you feel about the

12:08.469 --> 12:13.235
tour of duty just being one year?

12:16.139 --> 12:20.425
Did you think that that hurt or that helped, the 
fact that you were only there for a year and then

12:16.139 --> 12:20.425
gone? Well, in my particular case, wanting to be 
drafted and knowing the two-year induction, I

12:20.540 --> 12:28.109
knew that sooner or later it was time to go home. The 
one-year period, as far as the issue is concerned,

12:28.890 --> 12:38.361
I never really dealt with that until years later 
when I began to really think about all that had

12:28.890 --> 12:38.361
happened. One year is sufficient. But at the same 
time, under the conditions that we saw and under

12:42.847 --> 12:50.496
the conditions that existed there, Two days was 
too long. But you knew that 365 days your tour was

12:54.169 --> 12:58.775
over. And actually I went there at a time period 
that I would be there less than a year anyway. So in

13:05.424 --> 13:16.298
that respect I knew sooner or later the day would 
come when the oilers would come down and I'd be

13:05.424 --> 13:16.298
ready to make my way back to Houston.

13:18.821 --> 13:19.362
Okay. How did your unit, you and your unit, try and 
fight the war itself, like the operations? Well,

13:27.224 --> 13:40.323
to begin with, the 2nd of the 7th, which is the 2nd 
Battalion 7th Cavalry Regiment, which is part of

13:27.224 --> 13:40.323
the 1st Cav Air Mobile Unit, we were infantrymen. 
We were walking through jungles, triple canopy, a

13:41.484 --> 13:49.255
lot of vegetation. four trails in search of the NVA 
and the VC militarily. The areas that we worked in

13:56.624 --> 14:03.474
were combatant areas that meant anybody there was 
free game. Didn't matter if it was a child, didn't

14:03.495 --> 14:06.739
matter if it was a grandmother, it didn't matter. 
They had no business being there. They were told

14:08.462 --> 14:09.924
not to be there. Our operations were then search 
and destroy. It's a hard feeling, but at the same

14:15.232 --> 14:18.297
time, it's one of those that was a part of the 
operation. That's what you're trained for. Were

14:24.140 --> 14:35.213
there any problems with orders from the 
commanders to the soldiers themselves about the

14:24.140 --> 14:35.213
soldiers not wanting to go along with what was 
being said? We had a lot of disputes. In fact, I

14:36.815 --> 14:45.886
happened to be there at the time period that the 
refusals of walking trails became very much an

14:36.815 --> 14:45.886
important issue among the men. We knew we were 
there for less than a year. We weren't concerned

14:49.394 --> 14:51.756
about becoming generals. We were concerned about 
doing something that was right. It was surprising

14:56.200 --> 15:03.486
that most of the people that I worked with, the 
people that I was with, were more intelligent than

14:56.200 --> 15:03.486
I really thought. They were like me, a year of 
college now, or two years of college. Some of them

15:08.450 --> 15:18.439
did it simply because they found themselves 
caught in a dilemma of finances or caught in a

15:08.450 --> 15:18.439
dilemma of going to jail or going to war. this 
particular case, I had many people that were

15:19.212 --> 15:31.544
smarter than me, you know, and I believe we talked 
to each other in the different parts of the country

15:19.212 --> 15:31.544
that we were with. And the most important thing we 
wanted to do was come home. So when it comes to

15:36.228 --> 15:43.715
walking a trail and knowing that you could be 
ambushed, you could be a sitting duck, no. We

15:44.336 --> 15:44.936
rebelled. I was there Just about the time period 
that the news media was capturing this rebellious

15:47.107 --> 15:53.415
act. In fact, our company was one of the ones, our 
battalion was one of the ones interviewed, and

15:53.975 --> 16:04.568
pictures being sent back about military morale 
going down. How did they deal with that? How did the

16:07.512 --> 16:09.815
commanders deal with it? Well, as I say, the media 
took hold of that, and when the politicians

16:11.096 --> 16:15.882
brought it back, the message was then filtered 
back, I guess, you know, this is my personal point

16:17.296 --> 16:45.136
of view, was filtered back into saying that, you 
know, start, stop your military young

16:17.296 --> 16:45.136
lieutenants from forcing the issue and start 
listening to the men a little bit more because they

16:17.296 --> 16:45.136
actually, now, you know, now that the war is dying 
out and pacification has taken, has taken in place

16:17.296 --> 16:45.136
that we really don't need bad publicity for the 
war. And, uh, I'm sure that in Washington they felt

16:47.317 --> 17:04.176
very strongly that we needed to pick up the morale 
and we needed the American people behind us,

16:47.317 --> 17:04.176
backing us, because the war was coming to a close, 
but at the same time you didn't want any hard

16:47.317 --> 17:04.176
feelings. We eventually learned that many of our 
young lieutenants found themselves not being

17:04.496 --> 17:15.568
able to be heard when they spoke. And I think it 
finally came to a point after several deaths that

17:16.088 --> 17:24.380
the message got out that we meant business. We want 
to come home alive and not in a box or in a bag. Did any

17:30.148 --> 17:35.435
of that ever result in fragging of the officers in 
the cells that you know of? Actually, and

17:37.238 --> 17:45.910
specifically, there was a case, and I never really 
dealt with trying to find out whether This was the

17:46.126 --> 17:49.350
actual court martial. The day that I went into the 
field,

17:51.412 --> 18:07.449
the evening that I sat in a fire base, beginning to 
see the men that I'd be working with, there was a

17:51.412 --> 18:07.449
young second lieutenant who was going home. He was 
actually getting ready to be processed out, start

18:07.489 --> 18:12.214
his process out the next day. And he was well liked 
by many of them. the medics that were with me by many

18:16.113 --> 18:20.899
of the people that he worked with. He had learned to 
work with his men. And during the era that we went

18:24.423 --> 18:37.438
into Cambodia, which I missed, but that he was 
there, they had learned to like each other. And he

18:37.478 --> 18:38.479
was well liked. Anyway, that particular night, we 
had an opportunity to talk. Of course, I didn't

18:43.345 --> 18:45.968
really know him because I was new. very green into 
the country, and this particular individual. I

18:50.676 --> 18:51.897
spoke just very briefly. But he seemed like a good 
person. He was just a very strong attitude, very

18:54.840 --> 19:00.445
well-educated. And I felt like, well, he was 
there. It was time for him to go home, and he did his

19:04.569 --> 19:09.914
duty. But we went out on the field for several days, 
and when we came back, the word came out to me that he

19:15.293 --> 19:20.099
was involved in an incident in which he was killed. 
And I couldn't believe that because it just seemed

19:20.980 --> 19:26.528
that this guy looked, you know, hey, he's going 
home. He was real happy. And that's when

19:28.390 --> 19:35.199
everything started coming back to me as far as what 
this whole world was all about. Prior to that

19:37.662 --> 19:42.128
particular night, I was in Phuc Vinh, the night 
that I met him. I was in ,, which was the

19:42.783 --> 19:46.187
headquarters division. And I never really 
realized just how much hatred there was in this

19:46.227 --> 19:51.453
world. But we had plenty of Black Panther or 
Malcolm X people, I guess. I don't really know.

19:58.862 --> 20:01.405
It's just a lot of Black sentiment there. Many of 
the Blacks that were there felt like the whole

20:02.586 --> 20:07.332
world was against them. And they pretty well 
protect themselves. I remember a couple of them

20:09.514 --> 20:11.997
just constantly talking about, and using the 
language that they use, you know, about the whites

20:12.618 --> 20:17.505
and all this and that. So I realized there was a lot 
of bigotry and racial indifferences there. I

20:22.131 --> 20:36.892
didn't realize how drastic it became, but 
apparently the more, the closer you are to the

20:22.131 --> 20:36.892
weapons as they were there, it became real easy for 
instances to occur, especially the utter hatred

20:22.131 --> 20:36.892
that was there. And I, you know, and hearing... And 
like I said, I really, this is something that just

20:40.850 --> 20:45.015
happened to happen. But in overhearing some of the 
things that were said, it just, I played it down. I

20:51.203 --> 20:56.029
didn't, you know, I was new there, so I really 
didn't know what to expect. But it was just funny

20:56.089 --> 21:04.961
that here was a land that we were fighting, you 
know, an enemy, the NVA and the VC. At the same time,

21:05.441 --> 21:08.325
our worst enemy was ourselves. And in this 
particular case, when I found out that this

21:09.166 --> 21:15.095
fragging had occurred, the intention was to kill 
the first sergeant. The first sergeant wasn't

21:15.115 --> 21:16.858
even in the building. The frag supposedly rolled 
underneath the bunk in which the young dude, the

21:17.879 --> 21:25.090
first lieutenant, was sitting in. And 
apparently, he never knew what happened. But it

21:27.994 --> 21:32.982
was really surprising that years later, I read 
about it. I just happened to be looking at the

21:33.823 --> 21:38.430
paper, and I happened to see a first court martial 
dealing with the fragging incidents and it

21:38.731 --> 22:07.118
happened to be of a unit close to mine and I just put 
two and two together and said most likely in the

21:38.731 --> 22:07.118
back of my mind this is actually the

21:38.731 --> 22:07.118
situation that I knew of and although it was just 
one of those things that do occur it's one of those

21:38.731 --> 22:07.118
that begin to make you feel that, you know, why am I 
here? Because even if I, even if we win this war, I'm

22:13.390 --> 22:20.078
still going to, I'm still going to, I'll go back 
home to find that there's another war there. You

22:20.098 --> 22:24.323
know, and it really, it's really degrading, 
especially for morale purposes. You know, why are

22:24.584 --> 22:25.385
we there? Why are we there? Our real problems are 
really at home. And so in this case, this became

22:30.551 --> 22:36.638
really the first major incident that I had that 
occurred to me. And and specifically where

22:38.806 --> 22:41.730
fragging occurs. Okay, what about the problems 
with drugs? Did that have any negative effect on

22:47.419 --> 22:51.405
the fighting itself? Or did it have any effect at 
all? Well, drugs per se were more prevalent back in

22:54.189 --> 23:02.361
the installations. Out in the field, you were 
crazy if you lit up a joint because they gave you

23:04.103 --> 23:08.610
away. I remember one incident where one of the new 
guys, and this was several months after I'd been

23:08.962 --> 23:25.145
out in the field, one of the new guys came in, it was a 
black dude, he came in and he just went off to

23:08.962 --> 23:25.145
himself, just about 20 feet away from everybody, 
and he lit up a joint. He very quickly put that joint

23:27.208 --> 23:33.697
away when several of our rifles were pointed right 
at his head and said, you better not ever do that

23:27.208 --> 23:33.697
again. And then he all of a sudden felt like, you 
know, Well, this is the way I interpreted the war to

23:38.881 --> 23:43.266
be like. Well, I know he was black, and I know 
everybody called him the words we often hear, you

23:43.286 --> 23:52.596
dumb nigger, you know, but it's essentially the 
same thing. He learned very quickly that this

23:52.616 --> 24:04.669
isn't the place for this, you know, and he never did 
it again, but he always remembered that if they

23:52.616 --> 24:04.669
didn't kill him, we would, you know. Because we 
want to go home. That was the main thesis, is to

24:07.387 --> 24:13.394
count your days and essentially to come home. Were 
there any particular operations that were either

24:14.576 --> 24:28.314
successes, great successes, or just tremendous 
failures that you would like to talk about?

24:28.334 --> 24:30.436
Well, when you're out in the field, every day is an 
operation. Because every moment could be a last

24:31.878 --> 24:33.981
moment. We had several cases and several 
incidences that occurred with units that I was

24:35.024 --> 24:42.615
with, but none of them really stood out. It seemed 
like every day was just one of those days that, you

24:42.655 --> 24:49.445
know, really every day was a day to remember. There 
are some that stand out a little bit more, and I

24:50.627 --> 24:57.176
don't really know whether the successes are now. 
Apparently they did, because we ended up getting

24:57.236 --> 25:02.083
steaks and ice cream, and that's one of the 
rarities you find in the war. How did they measure

25:02.184 --> 25:03.225
the... the progress y'all were making? Well, 
actually we weren't, you know, we weren't really

25:06.859 --> 25:13.047
dealing with a measurement. I, if you're 
referring to kill count and the war was coming to a

25:13.067 --> 25:28.127
more controlling factor, we were giving more of 
the South Vietnamese more of the areas where it was

25:13.067 --> 25:28.127
really dangerous or we felt it was dangerous. I 
don't know, it was hard for me to judge that because

25:30.678 --> 25:38.287
It seemed like every time we had an operation or we 
had to go out in the field, we were going out in the

25:30.678 --> 25:38.287
field with potentially 200 to 300 feet seated 
where to be located. Because that was an area where

25:39.008 --> 25:45.996
the sensor devices and the night airplanes had 
noticed a lot of movement. So every day was an

25:46.857 --> 25:49.941
operation in itself. We stood very firm, very 
close, and ties communications to make sure that

25:49.981 --> 25:57.170
if we did run into a problem that we would get the 
backing. One particular incident. February the

25:59.872 --> 26:03.696
11th, I believe it was February the 11th. I'm 
almost positive that day always stands out in my

26:03.716 --> 26:05.918
mind. We were, our operations generally kept the 
platoons no more than a mile apart in the areas that

26:07.739 --> 26:24.235
we were sweeping to look for these bunkers and 
these battalion strength personnel that we were

26:07.739 --> 26:24.235
looking for. And there's one particular incident 
We were standing around and all of a sudden the word

26:28.424 --> 26:32.711
came out that one of the platoons had hit contact. 
And it seemed like all of a sudden everybody became

26:33.232 --> 26:43.668
supermen because we were all doing things that we 
generally don't do, and that is functioning

26:33.232 --> 26:43.668
together. We were always griping with each other, 
you know, and telling each other, you stupid,

26:43.869 --> 26:50.079
crazy person or whatever. But, you know, you ain't 
going home and your girlfriend's out with some

26:50.760 --> 26:53.504
other guy. We were always criticizing each other. 
In this particular case, all of a sudden, we all

26:55.812 --> 27:01.299
snapped and said, hey, you know, this other 
platoon is in trouble. We got the word through the

27:03.322 --> 27:05.946
company commander to converge. Immediately, we 
all began to get our stuff together, and we started

27:06.747 --> 27:12.194
running. And we ran down trails that we probably 
would never want to do, but the objective was to

27:13.096 --> 27:25.212
hurry up and get to the platoon that was hit and 
provide the perimeter support. secure the

27:25.850 --> 27:28.734
perimeter in order to get the people that were hurt 
out of there. I ran like I'd never run before. I

27:33.580 --> 27:35.822
guess I was glad that I was so physically fit. And 
before I knew it, you know, through the jungle,

27:36.984 --> 27:48.678
jumping over the dead logs, and I have no idea if I 
stepped on a boa constrictor or not, but I think I

27:36.984 --> 27:48.678
did. Something was slippery when I stepped on one. 
We made our engagement. And immediately upon

27:56.090 --> 28:07.242
arriving, I could see and I could hear the moans and 
the groans and the smell of powder. And there was

28:08.303 --> 28:10.365
still contact. We were still fighting. Some of the 
guys up in front were fighting.

28:16.492 --> 28:20.916
One of the soldiers was hit really bad, and his 
stomach was torn apart. He was screaming and

28:21.457 --> 28:24.240
hollering.

28:25.402 --> 28:26.784
damn it, he didn't want to die here. This wasn't the 
way it was supposed to be. We had two of the medics,

28:30.007 --> 28:34.072
the headquarters medics, was already there. And 
one of the other platoons was arriving very

28:35.153 --> 28:40.420
quickly. We were all converging pretty close. We 
weren't really that far. A mile apart is not really

28:43.403 --> 28:48.790
that far, but yet in a jungle it seems like 100 
miles. Anyway, we very quickly encountered the

28:53.397 --> 29:07.792
immediate spot where the entanglement occurred, 
and then were given the directions of where the

28:53.397 --> 29:07.792
fighting was, and it wasn't just, you know, listed 
50 feet further up, but he couldn't see it because

28:53.397 --> 29:07.792
of the thickness of the jungle. I don't know what 
was in the back of my mind. Not that I didn't care. I

29:13.017 --> 29:21.666
just thought that it was something I needed to do, 
and I just immediately took two of the guys, went

29:13.017 --> 29:21.666
straight on up front, where there was another 
person that was hit. And I didn't really realize

29:24.658 --> 29:37.451
it, because everything was happening so fast, 
that this other person that was hit had some

29:24.658 --> 29:37.451
fragments in his lung. And another one had 
something had gotten into his eye. He wasn't

29:41.175 --> 29:43.357
really sure if it was a fragment or he'd cut it. 
Anyway, I began to do my duties with them. I never

29:49.051 --> 29:54.279
really realized that less than 20 feet away there 
was a VC that was shooting in the opposite

29:49.051 --> 29:54.279
direction. And it just so happened that one of the 
guys that was with me happened to see him, it was

29:55.561 --> 30:13.928
just by accident, because there was so much noise 
going on and so much bombing going on, people

29:55.561 --> 30:13.928
throwing frags and everything, that he happened 
to see him and so he terminated him. At that

30:14.903 --> 30:19.108
particular time, you did things, and you just 
didn't, you functioned. This is what you were

30:19.629 --> 30:20.930
trained for. You don't have time to be sentimental 
or thinking. You just did it. Well, it was really

30:25.035 --> 30:43.577
just one of those operations where, I guess, if it 
was successful, it was the fact that we all played

30:25.035 --> 30:43.577
an important part in securing the area as well as 
being able to get the area to where we could get a

30:25.035 --> 30:43.577
helicopter to come in there and take the men that 
were hurt. It

30:44.519 --> 31:01.625
seemed like just a few days later when we were able 
to get into a nice, clear area of secureness that

30:44.519 --> 31:01.625
the hired officers came by and then awarded medals 
to the bravery. I guess that's where I got my first

31:02.186 --> 31:03.508
one. I'm positive. So many things happen so much, 
you just accept them and it's just like I say, every

31:06.372 --> 31:12.822
day is a different day. And in respect, I believe 
that there's no doubts about it. That's why I

31:18.741 --> 31:24.167
received my first Bronze Star with Valor. The 
other one deals with another incident, which I

31:24.187 --> 31:30.473
don't wish to really talk about. But as far as 
successes, that was just one incident. There were

31:33.857 --> 31:41.965
so many, and I guess that one stands out because I 
can still hear them yelling sometimes from time to

31:33.857 --> 31:41.965
time. that, damn, I don't want to go home, but I 
don't want to go home in a bag. Essentially, he

31:47.227 --> 31:48.068
died.

31:57.258 --> 31:57.879
We had a few. We had a few of them with us. Basically, 
they were scouts. And a scout is just one who is a

32:04.005 --> 32:10.132
little more familiar with the terrain than we are. 
Of course, we were already familiar with it had we

32:10.332 --> 32:13.015
been there for a while. In the event we encountered 
contact, if there was an opportunity to be able to

32:14.075 --> 32:27.988
discuss with these people why they were out there 
or if they were VC, he'd have an opportunity to talk

32:14.075 --> 32:27.988
with them. The ones that worked with us just a few 
times, we really didn't have too many of them, but

32:28.049 --> 32:38.859
the one that worked with us essentially went to 
another platoon. I understand, or I heard later on

32:39.940 --> 32:41.922
that that he accidentally blew himself up when he 
was trying to throw a grenade in an encounter. And

32:48.415 --> 32:52.040
that's just about the last one I remember. There 
were a few, but not that many. And we essentially

32:54.383 --> 32:59.090
were more into lacking a being to ourselves. It was 
just a trust problem. We didn't really, a lot of us

33:02.395 --> 33:10.086
didn't trust anybody that was from Vietnam. is 
that home feeling, you wanted to go home. You

33:12.647 --> 33:27.566
didn't want to get, you didn't want to find 
yourself totally trusting someone that could

33:12.647 --> 33:27.566
eventually, in this particular war, may 
eventually be the enemy. You couldn't tell the

33:27.586 --> 33:28.567
difference. Did you have a hard time telling the 
enemy from, like, say, the Vietnamese and the NVA

33:29.628 --> 33:36.697
and the VC? Vietnam in itself, say, they The French 
Vietnamese, of course, characteristically are

33:41.622 --> 33:46.309
different from the Chinese Vietnamese. And the 
Chinese are definitely distinctive between

33:47.972 --> 33:50.876
them. I mean, we ran into one that was at least 6'2". 
He was just, I guess, an advisor for the NBA. But

34:01.192 --> 34:02.895
essentially, this is what we were looking for. We 
were looking for the people that were hard cadre,

34:03.175 --> 34:09.385
hardcore, because they were the ones that we felt 
would intermingle with VC and organize and then

34:09.938 --> 34:20.869
provide the real confrontations that were 
prevalent throughout the country at all times.

34:21.970 --> 34:32.781
And in this particular case, during my tour of 
duty, we were constantly bumping into VC and NVA,

34:21.970 --> 34:32.781
which you really couldn't distinguish many of 
them. Because when they'd come into the country,

34:32.821 --> 34:38.207
essentially, they couldn't wear the type of 
uniforms or the type of clothing that they war in

34:38.643 --> 34:42.448
the north, simply to give them away, so that's why 
we couldn't really tell. DC people basically

34:43.269 --> 34:49.138
looked all the same to the southern Vietnamese 
people. That's why you really didn't trust anyone

34:49.158 --> 34:50.880
there. You made that number one priority.

34:57.129 --> 35:06.642
Being in Vietnam, seeing how your unit was 
fighting the war, what y'all were doing, did you at

34:57.129 --> 35:06.642
the time think that you were winning the war, or did 
you have any idea? We didn't care. We were there,

35:10.988 --> 35:13.432
and we knew, and we wanted to come home. We didn't 
care. We cared about securing ourselves, and we

35:15.375 --> 35:24.068
cared about wanting to go home, but as far as 
winning the war, we already knew it was lost. I

35:25.069 --> 35:30.397
don't think there are too many GIs that fought in 
the jungle that really felt that the war was a

35:25.069 --> 35:30.397
winning war. We were there for police action only, 
and that as long as the politicians back home did

35:36.946 --> 35:55.573
not give us the full strength and power that we 
needed, and all of the problems that were involved

35:36.946 --> 35:55.573
in there, such as having to have South Vietnamese 
approval before you could bomb the country, and

35:36.946 --> 35:55.573
having to spend nights in unsecured areas. I can 
remember one night we stayed awake all night long

35:55.613 --> 36:04.185
because we wanted arterial

35:55.613 --> 36:04.185
support. We couldn't get it because of the 
allocations. They had already let go of all the

36:08.205 --> 36:13.533
bombs that they could get rid of that day. So we had 
to wait till morning. That seems very stupid to me.

36:17.680 --> 36:19.403
Even the emergency allocations were gone. And all 
that amounted to is that we were playing a game of

36:20.064 --> 36:28.698
numbers, and that's why I guess essentially most 
of us just got turned off. What do you think could

36:29.079 --> 36:31.202
have done to... as far as the military was 
concerned, to try to win it?

36:37.953 --> 36:41.518
At that particular time, I don't think anybody 
knew. I guess that's why I met Westmoreland and got

36:42.159 --> 36:45.684
out of it.

36:47.386 --> 36:48.067
I don't really know. When you think about it, we 
weren't fighting a conventional war, which we

36:48.087 --> 36:56.278
were trained for. That's what we went to do 
training for, conventional warfare. Those are

36:59.802 --> 37:09.174
the ones that were able to go to advance military 
training in infantry, continued on with the

36:59.802 --> 37:09.174
conventional war. I mean, that's large units, big 
firepower, utilization of men, and essentially

37:09.675 --> 37:18.786
you were plunging into something. We were 
scattered, and we found ourselves like policemen

37:18.847 --> 37:26.957
on the streets in Houston, you know. If an incident 
occurs, well, they all converge together, and

37:27.443 --> 37:30.847
that's essentially what we did. We did a policing 
action. This war of attrition, actually, was that

37:32.429 --> 37:35.533
in itself. A little fighting here, a little 
fighting there, just something to keep nibbling

37:36.714 --> 37:39.958
away. There were really no major offenses

37:40.138 --> 37:47.747
like the offense of 1968 in the tent. We looked 
forward to one in 1971, but it didn't materialize,

37:48.849 --> 37:54.295
I guess, I guess General Gieff didn't want to lose 
any more men than he had lost in previous

37:56.350 --> 38:08.065
engagements, General Gieff being the main 
military mind of the NVA. So I don't know really

38:10.008 --> 38:22.083
what could have been done other than giving us the 
full strength of going in there and

38:10.008 --> 38:22.083
going all forth. We probably should have gone into 
Hanoi.

38:26.810 --> 38:28.592
I don't know if that would have made much 
difference either. Sometimes, you know, you

38:28.652 --> 38:32.937
think about it, it just would have been a cost of 
more lives on our part. But at the same time, with

38:33.698 --> 38:46.232
the politicalness that was going on and the 
atmosphere, you know, of just wait and see, that I

38:33.698 --> 38:46.232
don't really feel that at any time we were going to 
win the war. And I don't think anybody really felt

38:47.233 --> 38:54.702
that there was really a want and desire to win a war 
or win. Right. There's just too much at stake, too

38:55.885 --> 38:59.110
much cost, too much money, too many lives. So the 
police action seemed to be the best approach. Did

39:04.357 --> 39:08.203
you witness any pacification at all while you were 
in Vietnam? Yes. It's interesting with the time

39:10.927 --> 39:13.370
period that I was in the field. I was in combatant 
areas. But the 1st Cav, being the type of unit that

39:17.977 --> 39:25.167
it was and winning so many of the awards that it did, 
the time was coming for the divisions to come home.

39:31.082 --> 39:35.408
And out of the five divisions, four of them came 
home. We had a big stand-down. Secretary of State

39:37.431 --> 39:43.359
Dean Rusk was present, and all the generals and 
South Vietnamese president, I believe. I don't

39:43.880 --> 39:44.321
know why. I don't really remember who he was. But we 
had a huge, huge gathering of all of them, all of the

39:46.564 --> 39:53.894
men in a great march. It was just a huge thing. on the 
field by Ben Wyer base. And right afterwards, then

40:01.521 --> 40:07.326
everybody got reassigned. Those that were coming 
home could come home. Many got early outs to come

40:10.088 --> 40:11.850
home. But I was too new into the country. I didn't 
have the time period. And I still had time before my

40:17.835 --> 40:25.782
two years were up that I got reassigned. My 
reassignment went to the 229th Helicopter

40:25.964 --> 40:40.005
Assault Battalion, which was basically the 
helicopter unit servicing the 1st Cav for the

40:25.964 --> 40:40.005
division that was still there. And so then my tour 
of duty became more of working there in Benoit, at

40:40.025 --> 40:55.127
which time then we did begin to, I began to see more 
of the pacification programs helping the

40:55.698 --> 40:57.640
citizens. And so I took part in several of them in 
the sense of going down into the towns and going

40:57.700 --> 41:11.695
into Saigon and going into the

40:57.700 --> 41:11.695
orphanages and working with the people. We were, 
at the same time, giving more and more of the duty of

41:12.475 --> 41:19.743
combat to the South Vietnamese at that time. And so 
we began to see more and more of the South

41:19.823 --> 41:23.747
Vietnamese soldiers. which we didn't see before, 
or at least I didn't.

41:30.135 --> 41:42.250
I saw the change coming on, and it was funny how 
they... We knew that essentially we were going to

41:30.135 --> 41:42.250
give up our barracks to the South Vietnamese, and 
so we started cleaning them up. That's probably

41:43.011 --> 41:44.493
direct as you can be. You're cleaning up your 
barracks, you're planting flowers around your

41:45.034 --> 41:52.823
bunks, you're raking the area, you're... Even the 
latrines were cleaned a little bit more. And now

41:58.047 --> 42:05.234
all that had to do with was, you know, as far as we 
were concerned, is eventually we were going to go

41:58.047 --> 42:05.234
home and the South Vietnamese were going to take 
over the base. And essentially that's what

42:06.516 --> 42:15.085
happened anyway after the last of the men, I think, 
I believe in 72, started coming home. What about,

42:15.105 --> 42:17.808
like you said, you were in the jungle. Was the 
weather or the climate itself a hazard being

42:17.828 --> 42:23.113
there? Well, you know, when you freeze to death at 
90 degrees, the weather has an effect on you. When

42:34.446 --> 42:39.413
you hike the jungle, of course, there's a lot of 
moisture in the jungle, and you're sweating all

42:34.446 --> 42:39.413
the time. You get into a clearing spot where the sun 
can beat on you, and there you are. And basically

42:49.326 --> 42:53.151
every three to seven days you'd get, a new pair of 
clothes, just clean clothes, it's all a matter of

42:53.755 --> 43:01.525
two. The weather beats on you. It's unfortunate 
that 3.30 to 5.30 every evening during the monsoon

43:04.670 --> 43:12.981
rain season, the rains would come. Temperatures 
would drop to 80, 90 degrees and you'd freeze.

43:19.009 --> 43:21.552
You'd be freezing because you were used to the 110 
degrees. 120 degrees and the humidity is no

43:22.088 --> 43:50.205
different you know and it's effect than 
windshield factor you know I mean just you your

43:22.088 --> 43:50.205
body just can't you know it doesn't take it and so we 
found ourselves just uh from time to time just

43:22.088 --> 43:50.205
really wishing that we were out of there you know 
when you're soaking wet the rest of the night and

43:22.088 --> 43:50.205
then you got to fight leeches in the evening 
because they might get in they might crawl up up to

43:22.088 --> 43:50.205
you especially if you crawled if you've gone 
through a little river or a little creek, and the

43:50.810 --> 43:56.819
way the terrain is, it's just a jungle, and a 
jungle, it's hard to describe. There's just

43:56.839 --> 44:09.737
nothing but leaves and leaves, more leaves, and 
snakes and all other little insects that you just

43:56.839 --> 44:09.737
don't want to think about anymore, but it did have 
an effect. What about the anti-war

44:09.777 --> 44:13.963
demonstrators? How did you feel about those, 
seeing how you were there fighting and they didn't

44:14.064 --> 44:19.872
want to go? Well, let's start from the beginning 
first. You know, I didn't go. You know, the Chicago

44:25.138 --> 44:29.706
scene had already occurred in 68. I think with the 
election, you know, Richard Nixon had won

44:29.826 --> 44:36.436
presidency. There was a lot going on, but it wasn't 
close to me because I was graduating from high

44:37.198 --> 44:41.745
school then. You know, I was thinking about a 
future and not, you know, necessarily about a war.

44:46.793 --> 44:47.935
As I said, I really didn't know any more about the 
war than what I saw on 6 o'clock news. But at the same

44:52.119 --> 44:57.324
time, anti-war demonstrations of that period 
didn't really affect me. Even while over there in

44:57.364 --> 45:06.995
the jungle, the military was very good about not 
bringing up any of that subject. And so you just

45:07.236 --> 45:15.525
generally didn't hear it, except from the 
letters, the letters from coming back home from

45:07.236 --> 45:15.525
people who would talk about Did you hear about Kent 
State? Or whatever the case was. So anti-war

45:19.595 --> 45:25.462
demonstrating really didn't mean much to me until 
I came back home at that point. Then I realized that

45:25.522 --> 45:45.343
this continuance of this war that meant nothing to 
the people that I was with, then I started

45:25.522 --> 45:45.343
beginning to voice my opinion against it, which I 
took part in the march here in Houston where we

45:25.522 --> 45:45.343
walked from downtown on to onto the Herman Park and 
had our little rally. But as far as anti-war

45:51.094 --> 46:00.768
demonstrations at that particular time period, I 
didn't really deal with it because it didn't have

45:51.094 --> 46:00.768
any psychological barrier with me. Right. But now 
that afterwards, and having gone back and

46:01.990 --> 46:15.229
starting to think about it, now I can remember when 
in boot training, the National Guards, the

46:01.990 --> 46:15.229
reservists, We had plenty of them from New Jersey 
that were with us. They'd always be laughing

46:19.354 --> 46:22.578
about, oh, are you going to Vietnam? I'm going to go 
back home. How did you know about that? Well, I

46:26.783 --> 46:30.187
didn't really care about them, so I didn't listen 
to them. But at the same time, I knew that my tour

46:30.207 --> 46:34.433
duty probably would amount to going there. And as 
far as they were concerned, it wasn't anything

46:35.334 --> 46:42.583
that they had to worry about. You know, I think I 
mentioned once that, you know, they do activate

46:43.593 --> 46:51.321
National Guard units every once in a while. I think 
they did in Ohio once, you know. But it was just a

46:54.004 --> 46:57.287
tactic, you know, just something to get back at 
them. But generally I knew that there were so many

46:57.307 --> 47:11.642
who did evade the draft and evade service in 
Vietnam that, you know, I became one of the few

46:57.307 --> 47:11.642
that...

47:12.905 --> 47:17.372
You know, it was always talked about in the sense 
that you went over, you're going over there, you

47:12.905 --> 47:17.372
went over there, you know. I got all the negative 
feedback, which had some psychological bearing

47:18.834 --> 47:24.143
for a little while. But as the years have gone by, 
you know, I feel totally different, you know. I did

47:29.571 --> 47:30.793
my part. I stood, you know, I stood out. I can't say 
the same for them. Do you have any negative

47:36.682 --> 47:40.448
feelings towards those who evaded the draft or... 
Yeah, well, you look at a vice president now that

47:41.609 --> 47:45.658
did it. I don't have any sentiment for him, really. 
I could care less that he is vice president. I hope

47:52.553 --> 48:00.951
to hell George Bush doesn't walk away from the 
presidency because I can't imagine somebody like

47:52.553 --> 48:00.951
that leading our country.
