WEBVTT

00:02.022 --> 00:02.402
Exactly.

00:02.603 --> 00:04.765
Some did it a little more, some did it a little less.

00:05.946 --> 00:08.049
But we stopped doing it after that.

00:08.109 --> 00:09.550
You know we didn't do it anymore.

00:09.570 --> 00:10.791
Nobody got paddled for it?

00:11.672 --> 00:13.615
No because the upperclassmen thought it was good bull.

00:15.577 --> 00:18.019
And apparently it had been done in earlier years?

00:18.520 --> 00:20.722
Yes, because that outfit had been around for a while.

00:20.962 --> 00:29.852
And actually after that year they dissolved that outfit and they combined us with, they reorganized the corps in other words, that's what they did.

00:30.035 --> 00:32.859
our outfit and put it in with squadrons one and two.

00:33.941 --> 00:36.344
And they took some of the other outfits and combined them.

00:36.364 --> 00:46.038
So we had a mix of, sophomore year we had a mix of different outfits because we reorganized the whole structure of the Corps.

00:46.959 --> 00:53.308
And so, but I think one of the reasons they dissolved us is because we were kind of a hell raising

00:53.896 --> 01:00.664
group and and so they decided that no get rid of these guys and they're nothing but trouble you know so they split us up so.

01:01.324 --> 01:03.347
Now there wasn't a fish day in your town.

01:03.367 --> 01:03.567
Yes.

01:03.727 --> 01:04.248
There was one?

01:04.468 --> 01:05.489
Describe it please.

01:05.509 --> 01:06.390
We had two fish days.

01:07.191 --> 01:13.178
One in the fall and one in the spring and and you would go through the reverse.

01:13.819 --> 01:16.782
You would be the sophomore and the and the uh

01:16.762 --> 01:18.405
And the sophomore would be the freshman.

01:18.666 --> 01:20.870
And it was chaotic, chaotic.

01:20.990 --> 01:23.355
So would he come and clean up your room?

01:23.375 --> 01:23.535
No.

01:23.876 --> 01:24.257
Oh.

01:24.277 --> 01:24.818
No.

01:24.838 --> 01:26.060
He'd come up and mess up our room.

01:26.301 --> 01:26.721
Oh.

01:26.741 --> 01:30.188
See, because he would say that that's what we would do to him.

01:30.268 --> 01:31.010
Oh, I see.

01:31.030 --> 01:38.905
So if you brought him into your room, if you had him in your room for that day, then what he was going to do while he was there, he was going to

01:39.813 --> 01:46.243
pull down your bed, step on your shoes, throw your clothes out of the closet.

01:46.684 --> 01:50.189
You know, he would just go in there and just start throwing it all out.

01:51.071 --> 01:58.863
And if you were smart enough, you knew you couldn't really pick on him that much because the next day it came back to the same old thing, you know.

01:58.883 --> 02:00.145
So you stayed away from that.

02:00.265 --> 02:05.213
But I guess the way we retaliated with the sophomores, because you could only go one class above you.

02:05.851 --> 02:07.997
We used to have the drown outs.

02:08.017 --> 02:09.601
I don't know if you've heard of the drown outs.

02:09.661 --> 02:10.904
We used to do those a lot.

02:12.308 --> 02:16.198
And we used to do the babble bombs a lot.

02:16.837 --> 02:21.646
What did you all use as the explosive for the Babel bomb?

02:21.666 --> 02:24.491
Well we'd get a can of Babel and put a cherry bomb in there.

02:24.511 --> 02:25.032
Just a cherry bomb.

02:25.052 --> 02:30.302
And just roll it into the room and boom and everything's Ajaxed.

02:30.322 --> 02:37.495
And of course we'd have to clean up the room because they'd go looking for you and if they couldn't find a particular freshman that did it they'd just

02:37.475 --> 02:39.482
pull all the freshman class out.

02:39.502 --> 02:40.525
Same thing with the drown outs.

02:41.167 --> 02:48.210
Pull all the freshman class and put you in there to clean up the room and you'd clean it, but you'd have fun doing it because

02:48.730 --> 02:59.881
You would work on doing some things to them that they wouldn't realize, like instead of using the regular shoe polish on their shoes, you'd put Johnson wax on there or you'd put shaving cream in there.

02:59.901 --> 03:06.147
So when they got up in the morning and put the shoe on, they'd, those kind of things would always happen.

03:06.328 --> 03:09.591
Did just about every freshman participate in these things?

03:10.051 --> 03:10.852
Yes, yes.

03:11.052 --> 03:11.993
The drownouts were mass.

03:12.193 --> 03:14.856
In other words, every freshman had to do it.

03:15.140 --> 03:18.307
And we were all responsible, and we knew what we were going to do.

03:18.327 --> 03:23.499
And if we didn't do like a mass drownout, we would pick a certain hole with a sophomore.

03:24.441 --> 03:26.145
But we were all involved in it.

03:26.225 --> 03:27.248
We knew that was happening.

03:27.268 --> 03:30.094
I mean, it was just like we'd meet, okay, who we were going to hit.

03:30.766 --> 03:48.686
Or we'd say okay let's do them all at one time and boom we'd go do them all at one time and we'd get these coke, the cartons that were, the wood cartons, and we'd use them to actually jar their door so they couldn't get out.

03:48.766 --> 03:50.789
So that's the way we'd try to get away with it.

03:50.809 --> 03:52.691
But I mean they were going to know who did it.

03:52.771 --> 03:55.474
I mean they were going to get away with it.

03:55.589 --> 04:02.778
Now did you all ever avoid doing that to anybody who might have a big test the next day?

04:02.818 --> 04:05.041
Not that I can recall.

04:05.161 --> 04:05.662
Is that right?

04:05.682 --> 04:08.906
I don't think we were that nice.

04:09.226 --> 04:11.649
Let's see, did you have a nickname as a freshman?

04:11.669 --> 04:15.835
Well actually when I came here my name was, was, was Gregory.

04:16.195 --> 04:19.359
And that's the way everybody called me through high school.

04:19.379 --> 04:21.782
When I came here,

04:22.471 --> 04:23.733
everybody shortened it to Greg.

04:24.315 --> 04:26.339
And that's what stuck.

04:26.399 --> 04:28.102
We used to have nicknames for each other, yes.

04:28.463 --> 04:38.182
Hot Tamale, WAP, you know, those kind of things.

04:38.362 --> 04:41.188
But those were only within ourselves, not really like

04:41.573 --> 04:47.249
like that we used them in front of an underclassman or in front of upperclassmen who were freshmen.

04:47.269 --> 04:47.570
All right.

04:47.590 --> 04:51.761
Now, in today's lingo, some of the nicknames would be politically incorrect.

04:51.781 --> 04:52.603
Yes, correct.

04:52.623 --> 04:55.752
But you all didn't think of them in those terms at all, did you?

04:56.727 --> 05:06.127
Really, it really didn't bother me because I figured that I had proven myself as a person just like anybody else.

05:06.387 --> 05:11.558
And it's the same way as a person from Italian descent, probably the same way.

05:11.638 --> 05:13.943
You know, we were all like

05:14.243 --> 05:17.248
one, you know, and that's the way we looked at it.

05:17.308 --> 05:20.254
When it came down to the nitty-gritty, we were all as one.

05:20.274 --> 05:22.918
It didn't make any difference what you were.

05:23.139 --> 05:31.473
I mean, I didn't know that the guy that was next to me was rich or the guy next to me was poor.

05:32.215 --> 05:38.125
I had no idea of any of those things because they never let you

05:38.105 --> 05:51.644
I figured, of course you figure out the guy was rich because he had a car on campus, you know, but there weren't very many of those, you know, so the majority of us were, we really didn't pay much attention to that.

05:52.826 --> 06:00.276
Like I tell everybody that if you were a part of the group that was it.

06:01.197 --> 06:01.598
That's it.

06:01.966 --> 06:07.057
that nothing else mattered and you were fully accepted.

06:07.337 --> 06:07.578
Right.

06:07.718 --> 06:09.723
And everybody participated.

06:10.665 --> 06:11.667
Everybody participated.

06:11.687 --> 06:12.689
Nobody was left out.

06:12.709 --> 06:13.731
Nobody was left out.

06:14.150 --> 06:18.756
The only one that would be left out is if it's an individual that was having trouble.

06:19.977 --> 06:24.002
And you would have to try to bring that individual back into the group.

06:25.063 --> 06:38.820
And normally it would work, you know, say a freshman or even a sophomore, if they said the sophomore's not cutting the mustard, you know, or freshman's not cutting the mustard, you need to bring him up to par with the rest of you guys.

06:39.160 --> 06:42.064
And it was a responsibility of the class to bring him up to par.

06:42.449 --> 06:44.552
And we always carried that through, I mean all the way through.

06:44.572 --> 06:55.366
I remember being a senior and I'd see a freshman in my outfit that I felt that maybe needed to, you know, be polished up a little bit and I would go to the freshmen that I felt were the leaders.

06:56.147 --> 07:01.695
In a week I expect this freshman to be just like the rest of you guys.

07:01.775 --> 07:03.097
And they would normally work on that.

07:03.117 --> 07:07.663
What was it like to go to football games as a freshman fish drill team member?

07:08.065 --> 07:09.366
Well no we didn't.

07:09.666 --> 07:10.707
We went in with our outfits.

07:10.727 --> 07:16.753
We never went, we only had, actually back then we never even had one game that we marched as a unit.

07:17.073 --> 07:23.179
The only time we marched as a unit outside the campus with the Corps was on the Corps trips.

07:24.260 --> 07:29.445
And when we had the Corps trip they would let us march as one unit, as a fish drill team.

07:29.465 --> 07:32.187
Do you remember where you went that fall in the Corps trip?

07:32.267 --> 07:33.088
Yes, Fort Worth.

07:33.609 --> 07:35.350
Describe Fort Worth, Dallas.

07:35.390 --> 07:37.212
We were playing.

07:37.664 --> 07:38.986
No we were playing at SMU.

07:39.086 --> 07:41.391
It was in Dallas.

07:41.871 --> 07:42.512
How did you get there?

07:43.434 --> 07:44.556
Hitched the ride.

07:45.177 --> 07:45.718
Hitched the ride.

07:46.780 --> 07:51.568
And actually that's why our outfit was in so much trouble.

07:51.608 --> 07:55.054
We had this junior, his name was Smith.

07:56.136 --> 07:57.078
He was a chunky guy.

07:58.300 --> 08:02.828
And everybody liked him and he was everybody's buddy you know.

08:03.263 --> 08:21.791
And so we went on the court trip, and, of course, first thing Friday night we were going to be, they told us, you have your uniform on, you go over to TWU because they're going to have the big dance, and you'll get a honey over there and all that kind of stuff, and you might even get a date.

08:21.891 --> 08:27.179
It wasn't a situation where you had to worry about getting a ticket to the game because you could always get it.

08:28.141 --> 08:29.303
And so we'd go over there.

08:29.323 --> 08:32.207
So the junior said, okay, I'll tell you what I'm going to do.

08:32.980 --> 08:38.087
I am the quartermaster here, you pay me and what do you want to drink?

08:39.469 --> 08:50.484
And I'll meet you at this certain area at TWU and I'll give you your requirement, you know, which was whatever you ordered, bourbon, scotch or whatever, so he would do that.

08:51.105 --> 08:56.733
And he'd be there in his car and have a trunk open and he'd be the distributor of the alcohol.

08:57.334 --> 08:59.477
We would always have outfit parties.

08:59.575 --> 09:04.827
and the outfit parties were always, we would drop handles at the outfit parties.

09:05.178 --> 09:10.183
And the upperclassmen, like the juniors and seniors will always treat us a lot better than the sophomores.

09:10.203 --> 09:16.269
The sophomores always were a little still, a little strong on us, but they couldn't haze you or anything like that.

09:16.289 --> 09:17.631
And we'd have a good time.

09:17.711 --> 09:21.194
I mean it was kind of a bonding time away from here.

09:21.234 --> 09:22.335
We used to have beer busts.

09:23.356 --> 09:24.918
Some people probably have told you that.

09:24.938 --> 09:29.903
We'd have beer busts on the Brazos and we'd go out there to the pit out there and then

09:30.305 --> 09:41.450
They'd have these keg of beers and we'd drink the beer and come back and get something to eat and then everybody would go to sleep that Friday night and get up the next morning before the football game and we'd go to our drill.

09:41.470 --> 09:42.593
We used to drill on Saturdays.

09:42.613 --> 09:43.815
We used to have drill on Saturdays.

09:44.357 --> 09:45.900
So every Saturday part of our

09:45.880 --> 09:52.107
week was the bull-tex part of it, which was either drill or going to a class.

09:52.547 --> 10:00.016
So every Saturday for the four years that I was here we had a Saturday morning drill or bull-tex, whatever it was.

10:00.096 --> 10:02.478
So we did have that.

10:03.119 --> 10:14.572
Back on this court trip though, you marched as, and that day you and your buddies marched as the fish drill team in Dallas.

10:14.612 --> 10:15.533
How did you feel?

10:15.614 --> 10:22.502
Oh, it was a great feeling because, I mean, you know, you felt like, well, you know, I accomplished

10:23.731 --> 10:25.594
something or something great for you.

10:25.614 --> 10:31.802
I mean it was like everybody knew that you were, you know, because we wore a different uniform.

10:31.822 --> 10:37.270
We didn't wear like the same uniform that the rest of the corps was wearing so we had our own uniform.

10:37.350 --> 10:39.893
What did the fish rail team dress uniform look like?

10:40.314 --> 10:46.823
Back then we would wear the blouse, but we had like white belts and of course the scarf.

10:47.804 --> 10:53.232
We'd wear jump boots with white lacing.

10:53.448 --> 11:02.143
And sometimes we'd wear the hat, the regular little hat or helmet liner, dependent.

11:03.385 --> 11:06.130
And did you have a date that weekend or do you remember?

11:06.170 --> 11:07.553
No, I did not have a date.

11:07.573 --> 11:08.414
Where did you spend the night?

11:10.217 --> 11:14.585
That night I stayed at a friend's house in Dallas.

11:15.126 --> 11:16.789
I still remember his name, Roland.

11:17.343 --> 11:17.924
Garcia.

11:18.385 --> 11:20.108
He was in the Army unit.

11:20.990 --> 11:30.588
And my best friend who was in his outfit talked to him and he said we could stay over at his place, which I can't even remember.

11:30.608 --> 11:34.215
He lived a very modest family.

11:34.255 --> 11:36.499
I mean they were Hispanic and

11:36.968 --> 11:42.797
And they had a very modest home, and I guess I would say probably east part of Dallas.

11:43.078 --> 11:45.482
And so that's where we spent two nights.

11:45.502 --> 11:47.946
We stayed there Friday night and then Sunday night.

11:48.627 --> 11:57.441
Now when I was a junior, we got a little smarter, and TWU would always have these

11:57.742 --> 12:03.048
accommodations in some of the dormitories, the old wood shacks that they had that were not occupied.

12:03.589 --> 12:10.177
So we would get the rooms for two dollars a night with, they'd give us sheets and the blankets, and we were there for two nights.

12:11.178 --> 12:12.319
And that was pretty good.

12:12.499 --> 12:13.120
That was pretty good.

12:13.540 --> 12:17.065
How did you and your buddies treat those young ladies from TWU?

12:17.665 --> 12:18.707
We treated them real well.

12:20.128 --> 12:22.551
It was so different from today.

12:23.054 --> 12:28.602
I remember when I was a junior, my dad bought me a car.

12:28.862 --> 12:31.265
Because my mother would complain because I would hitchhike back and forth.

12:32.367 --> 12:40.698
And so my dad, I came home, the end of my sophomore year, and right before I came into my junior year, my dad said, I want you to go with me.

12:40.738 --> 12:41.179
So I went.

12:41.840 --> 12:47.367
And he bought me this 57 Buick Riviera hardtop.

12:48.008 --> 12:49.150
And it was nice.

12:49.230 --> 12:51.593
It was bright red, we used to call it big red.

12:52.096 --> 12:54.999
And it was a beautiful car.

12:55.500 --> 13:03.810
And the idea was, okay you bring it up during football season, son, but you give it back to us after football season and we used it.

13:04.311 --> 13:09.597
And he had another car of course, but you know I gave him the car back after football season.

13:09.617 --> 13:19.909
So we would go, when I was a junior I had the car, of course I was big buddies with a lot of the guys because they wanted to go with you up to TWU and you're in that car and we're going to be all right.

13:20.665 --> 13:33.741
And I remember junior year I had these sophomores with me and one of them told me, well I can get you into the dance or I can get you into this.

13:35.944 --> 13:46.116
I can get you into these different places but we have to say, we can get you a room, but we have to say that you're going out to the dance with one of these girls.

13:46.619 --> 13:47.541
All right, that's fine.

13:48.544 --> 13:49.847
So they assigned us a girl.

13:50.047 --> 13:50.849
We went up there.

13:51.270 --> 13:51.932
We got the room.

13:51.972 --> 13:53.115
We had the girls, of course.

13:53.596 --> 13:55.501
And we went to the dormitory that they were in.

13:55.721 --> 13:57.065
And it was really a nice house.

13:57.365 --> 13:59.270
And they came down.

13:59.310 --> 13:59.831
They met us.

14:00.253 --> 14:02.077
And God, they were all good looking.

14:02.157 --> 14:04.122
I mean, we were just like, wow.

14:04.102 --> 14:11.973
And the girl that one of my buddies had was supposed to go with, he didn't really like her, but I did.

14:12.113 --> 14:15.017
And so the other, he liked the one that I was supposed to go.

14:15.037 --> 14:16.579
So we kind of like worked it out.

14:16.659 --> 14:23.348
And so this girl was from Rio Grande City, a very, very nice young lady.

14:23.548 --> 14:25.771
And Rodriguez was her last name.

14:25.831 --> 14:27.674
And she was, she was very, very pretty.

14:28.014 --> 14:33.822
And, but anyway, she, her father was a county judge and, and,

14:34.004 --> 14:36.247
a colonel in the Air Force Reserves.

14:37.369 --> 14:40.373
And so we became good friends.

14:40.593 --> 14:46.682
We were never serious about each other but we went to the dance that night, took them to the football game the next day and we had a great time.

14:47.003 --> 14:52.370
And we always tried to treat them right because they always treated us right.

14:52.931 --> 15:01.544
So I don't think we were, I can recall anybody ever did anything that was out of hand or misbehaved that I can recall.

15:02.004 --> 15:03.927
I know we used to have this one thing.

15:04.210 --> 15:06.595
We, in our outfit, we used to call the moose pot.

15:08.118 --> 15:14.391
And the moose pot, we'd all pitch into the moose pot, and the guy that had the ugliest date would get the monies.

15:14.672 --> 15:16.014
So I mean it all worked out.

15:16.034 --> 15:19.722
So I don't know if everybody told you about that before.

15:20.005 --> 15:24.111
Did you go home Thanksgiving your freshman year?

15:24.452 --> 15:24.652
Yes.

15:26.555 --> 15:28.398
What were you thinking about A&M by then?

15:28.458 --> 15:29.039
Did you like it?

15:29.599 --> 15:31.322
By that time I was pretty much an Aggie.

15:31.562 --> 15:33.265
I mean there was no ands and buts.

15:33.305 --> 15:34.166
I was going to be an Aggie.

15:34.206 --> 15:41.277
I mean I was, you know, being a freshman wasn't bothering me anymore.

15:41.317 --> 15:45.203
I mean I think about the first month or so, I mean I hated it.

15:45.537 --> 15:51.083
But then after that, I mean I started, you used to get adjusted, okay, being a fish drill team helped me, I mean no doubt about it.

15:51.904 --> 16:02.995
And I guess another thing that helped me, and I didn't mention this to you in this, is when I walk into, I was taking, I was a pre-law major so I had to take two years of Spanish, okay.

16:04.016 --> 16:13.266
And so when I walk into my Spanish class, and I knew how to speak the language, it was not a problem, but I never had really learned

16:13.533 --> 16:19.265
you know, the grammar and the writing and the reading, so that's why I wanted to take it.

16:20.086 --> 16:27.762
So I walk into the classroom and behold, my CO and my executive officer are in that class.

16:28.788 --> 16:32.695
And they saw me walk into the class, I guess they assumed that you ought to speak Spanish.

16:33.356 --> 16:39.948
So Captain Gatlin, he was the squadron commander, Fish Garcia come here.

16:41.671 --> 16:44.937
So I go over there and he says, you sit right here between the two of us.

16:45.859 --> 16:50.307
So it was Bruce Hudson was the executive officer and Johnny Gatlin was the CO.

16:50.287 --> 17:00.256
So go back to the dorm and that night all of a sudden they tell me you're going to move out of your hole and you're moving to the hole next to the CO and the Executive Officer.

17:00.416 --> 17:01.016
Okay fine.

17:01.076 --> 17:06.281
So my roommate at that time was a young man from Amarillo and so they made us move all our stuff over.

17:07.422 --> 17:20.293
And they kind of stayed away from us because they knew that we were, that I was helping them through their, they were already seeing or remembering this and so they needed to complete those courses and so anyway they

17:20.273 --> 17:22.135
I had it made with them.

17:22.416 --> 17:33.229
And they always, he would always, you know, we'd study together and I guess some of the upperclassmen didn't like that too much because they felt well this guy's like the pet of.

17:33.890 --> 17:36.353
So did you do well academically that first semester?

17:36.513 --> 17:37.715
First semester I did well.

17:37.855 --> 17:43.682
Second semester I stumbled, but I mean I still did okay.

17:43.662 --> 17:53.217
I guess based it on four point, I was at first semester probably at a little over two point, about two point five.

17:54.639 --> 17:58.806
I almost had a two point out of three point in my first semester.

17:58.866 --> 18:00.929
So it would be close to a three.

18:01.069 --> 18:01.830
Yeah.

18:01.850 --> 18:06.998
And then the second semester I struggled and I don't know what happened but I did struggle my second semester.

18:07.359 --> 18:11.205
I think girlfriend problems, one of the reasons I struggled, and my girlfriend flushed me.

18:11.185 --> 18:12.567
Was she back home?

18:12.808 --> 18:14.210
She was in San Antonio, yeah.

18:14.230 --> 18:23.806
She flushed me and I'm sure you've heard the story that when they would flush you you'd get the Dear John letter and you'd give it to the first sergeant.

18:23.946 --> 18:26.431
Oh no, describe that.

18:26.451 --> 18:34.965
If you didn't have to do this but you would, I mean you'd take the letter and say, look sir, you know, my girlfriend just flushed me.

18:35.485 --> 18:37.268
And he'd say, OK.

18:37.288 --> 18:39.032
So he'd say, well, do you want to share the letter?

18:39.172 --> 18:40.134
Yeah, he'd read it.

18:40.254 --> 18:40.795
It's OK.

18:41.396 --> 18:45.184
After call the quarters tonight, we'll bring the outfit out, and we'll have the ceremony.

18:45.204 --> 18:51.476
And the ceremony consisted of bringing out everybody to include all the upperclassmen, seniors, juniors, sophomores, freshmen.

18:51.496 --> 18:52.057
In your outfit.

18:52.357 --> 18:53.239
In your outfit.

18:53.259 --> 18:54.321
Line up on the wall.

18:54.723 --> 18:58.767
And of course you're down, you know, and you're feeling bad.

18:59.288 --> 19:04.053
So the first sergeant would get up there and start reading the letter and they'd make remarks about it, you know.

19:04.713 --> 19:06.555
Not nice remarks, but remarks.

19:08.177 --> 19:17.066
So when he completed reading the letter, you know, everybody would kind of sympathize with you and they'd have a 21-gun salute for you.

19:17.086 --> 19:20.089
And the 21-gun salute was

19:20.069 --> 19:29.136
going to the crappers, they'd have freshmen in the crappers, and they'd flush the crapper 21 times, take the letter and flush it down the toilet, see.

19:29.156 --> 19:31.824
So they would do, that was... Really a flush.

19:32.024 --> 19:33.208
Yeah, really flush, yeah.

19:33.228 --> 19:34.973
So that's why they call it a flush letter.

19:35.290 --> 19:41.059
All right, so at the end of that first year you're still pretty sure you're going to stay and all.

19:41.079 --> 19:41.179
Yes.

19:41.400 --> 19:42.381
Yeah, there was no doubt about it.

19:42.561 --> 19:45.826
What did you do that first summer after the year?

19:45.867 --> 19:49.392
My dad worked for Polly Kruger, I think I mentioned that to you.

19:50.434 --> 19:59.087
And Polly Kruger owned all these San Antonio machine supply companies in the state that they had them all, Harland's and Corpus, Midland, Odessa, San Antonio.

19:59.107 --> 20:00.910
San Antonio was a corporate headquarters.

20:01.193 --> 20:08.865
And Polly Kruger told me, told my dad, as long as your son's at A&M, he has a job here at my place.

20:09.806 --> 20:12.110
So he put me in a boiler shop that first year.

20:12.871 --> 20:13.813
Oh man that was tough.

20:14.574 --> 20:15.275
It was hard work.

20:15.716 --> 20:19.802
I mean I knew then I wanted to come back to school because I was working in a welding.

20:19.942 --> 20:24.990
You know we would build these water tanks and so I spent time out in Pleasanton.

20:24.970 --> 20:27.914
putting this water tank together, spent the whole summer there.

20:28.335 --> 20:29.657
That was hard work.

20:30.698 --> 20:32.361
And I mean, that was hard work.

20:32.681 --> 20:35.665
And every summer I'd go back, he never gave me an easy job.

20:35.685 --> 20:39.311
He always put me in an area where I had to work hard.

20:39.411 --> 20:43.937
You know, I mean, maybe I was a helper for someone, but I mean, I had to work hard.

20:44.017 --> 20:54.252
And I mean, that made me appreciate the fact that I was going to college, and I'd see these older gentlemen that were working away and saying, God, man, I don't see how these guys can do it, you know.

20:54.687 --> 20:57.270
That's why I was glad that I was coming back to school, so.

20:59.212 --> 21:04.458
So you come back as a sophomore, and the new outfit, what number?

21:04.498 --> 21:05.019
Squadron 2.

21:05.279 --> 21:06.020
Squadron 2.

21:06.260 --> 21:07.221
Did it have a nickname?

21:07.661 --> 21:09.423
Yeah, it's Gator 2, it's still around.

21:09.624 --> 21:10.264
Gator 2.

21:10.405 --> 21:11.225
Yeah, Gator 2.

21:11.886 --> 21:21.897
And new friends, because some of the, I presume some of the outfit mates were new guys?

21:22.158 --> 21:24.340
Oh yeah, we had a combination of

21:24.927 --> 21:28.633
My roommate, my official lady and I were still the same.

21:28.833 --> 21:31.036
I mean we had been in Squadron 6 together.

21:32.158 --> 21:34.882
And so we were roommates.

21:35.323 --> 21:47.202
And then the others, we probably had about half and half, maybe 35, maybe 30 sophomores, something like that, and half were from one of the other outfits and the other half were from.

21:47.222 --> 21:48.243
What about the leadership?

21:48.704 --> 21:52.289
Leadership was the one that had been in the other outfit.

21:52.890 --> 21:53.331
Yeah.

21:53.699 --> 21:56.645
But you had that barber pole?

21:56.845 --> 21:57.887
Yeah, barber pole, yeah.

21:57.907 --> 21:58.829
I could wear that everywhere.

21:58.869 --> 22:00.091
Did that help as a sophomore?

22:00.332 --> 22:00.712
Oh, yeah.

22:01.013 --> 22:01.895
Yeah, it always did.

22:02.255 --> 22:06.864
How was life for a sophomore better than a freshman?

22:07.065 --> 22:09.089
Well, you didn't have to sit at attention in the mess hall.

22:10.050 --> 22:11.333
You'd have to call everybody, sir.

22:11.613 --> 22:13.497
You'd drop handles with everybody.

22:13.915 --> 22:15.417
Those were the good things.

22:16.338 --> 22:20.884
You had to start developing a leadership role within the outfit.

22:20.924 --> 22:33.640
Of course, you know, which the leadership role was basically by being assigned as athletic corporal or squad leader, assistant squad leader, something like that.

22:33.720 --> 22:37.284
So those were the leadership roles that they would give you.

22:37.645 --> 22:39.787
And, of course, you worked with a freshman a lot.

22:39.868 --> 22:41.830
You actually tried to make sure that

22:42.029 --> 22:48.240
they followed the rule, because if they didn't do what you were supposed to do, then you were held responsible for it by the juniors.

22:48.901 --> 22:54.411
So you started having more of a leadership role, and that was the difference.

22:55.433 --> 23:00.021
Responsibilities started coming on, you know, and I think

23:00.676 --> 23:10.910
I was able to study a lot better as a sophomore, you know, not maybe because of the discipline but because I got more adjusted to what was going on.

23:14.535 --> 23:17.819
What would have happened back home if you had quit college?

23:17.960 --> 23:19.502
What would your parents have done?

23:20.603 --> 23:25.350
My dad would have been very disappointed for sure because he wanted me to complete here.

23:25.991 --> 23:27.713
My mother didn't want me to come to A&M.

23:28.283 --> 23:53.636
But I think that after she saw me go through the freshman year and the accomplishments that I had, grades of course not as good as they always wanted them to be, but the fact that I made the fish drill team and I was a guide on the fish drill team and that I was selected the outstanding freshman in my outfit, you know, those made her feel very proud.

23:53.876 --> 23:57.160
And being a woman who came from Mexico

23:57.815 --> 23:59.978
could not speak English very well.

24:00.840 --> 24:15.543
To her, it was like, God, you know, I've really done something for my son, you know, I really have made him, I know he's gonna be better off than what we are, you know, and so she loved it, she loved it.

24:15.763 --> 24:19.188
I mean, she, at that point after that, it was like she supported it.

24:19.228 --> 24:23.535
Now, if I'd ever have, would have ever told my dad I was leaving,

24:23.988 --> 24:25.190
And we talked about this.

24:25.531 --> 24:36.291
I said, Dad, if I don't want to finish out, say, after my junior, sophomore year, junior year, he said, the only thing he told me was, son, if you're not mad enough to finish, then you don't need to come home.

24:36.312 --> 24:39.959
So that kind of encouraged me a little bit.

24:39.979 --> 24:42.884
I can understand that very well.

24:42.904 --> 24:44.427
You change your major wins.

24:44.845 --> 24:48.991
In my sophomore year I went to business and I was running way behind.

24:49.952 --> 24:54.117
What led you to decide against law and in favor of business?

24:54.137 --> 25:05.232
I really didn't want to follow the history and government major that I had and so I felt that I needed to, I had no plans of going on to law school.

25:05.353 --> 25:13.924
I thought about it, my mother wanted me to do that, but I figured it was really a hardship for them and putting me through college at that point was, I mean I figured well I can always do it.

25:14.427 --> 25:20.376
if I want to with a business major, you know, eventually I could go to law school or whatever, you know.

25:20.836 --> 25:22.479
Did you seek any advice?

25:22.659 --> 25:22.919
Yes.

25:23.099 --> 25:26.144
I went to a counselor here, and I can't remember his name.

25:26.564 --> 25:28.607
It wasn't the same one, not the same one.

25:28.908 --> 25:30.310
I never had the same one really.

25:30.490 --> 25:35.057
And he looked at my scores and he said, well you can do that, you know, you'll be all right.

25:35.117 --> 25:36.899
So I followed that.

25:37.100 --> 25:42.207
And I actually wanted to take accounting but I had too many hours, I was too far behind.

25:42.760 --> 25:44.623
And I was trying to finish in four years.

25:44.703 --> 25:53.717
So the biggest mistake I made was that in my junior year, I took 20 hours one semester and 21 hours the next to catch up.

25:54.418 --> 25:57.102
And that was tragic because, I mean, I struggled.

25:57.262 --> 25:58.985
I struggled because of too many courses.

25:59.205 --> 26:00.107
But you still passed it.

26:00.127 --> 26:01.609
I passed every one of them.

26:01.869 --> 26:05.455
And I maintained the grade to stay.

26:05.535 --> 26:07.798
And then eventually my senior year was a good year, though.

26:08.279 --> 26:10.202
I mean, as far as grades were concerned.

26:10.486 --> 26:11.447
had more time to do.

26:11.868 --> 26:17.156
Did you and your buddies know about any easy courses where the grades were just?

26:17.216 --> 26:17.476
Sure.

26:18.357 --> 26:19.239
What were some of those?

26:19.299 --> 26:19.860
Geology.

26:20.200 --> 26:20.661
Is that right?

26:20.741 --> 26:21.101
It was easy?

26:21.542 --> 26:21.903
Oh yeah.

26:22.243 --> 26:29.494
I think we had this geology course that was, that was, it was, it was an easy course.

26:29.554 --> 26:31.276
Everybody knew about it and everybody would take it.

26:31.296 --> 26:32.218
It was a four hour course.

26:32.238 --> 26:33.339
We had a lab and all that.

26:33.800 --> 26:35.342
Do you remember who taught it?

26:35.382 --> 26:35.943
No.

26:35.963 --> 26:36.624
It was a big guy.

26:36.724 --> 26:38.687
Did it have a nickname, the course?

26:38.870 --> 26:46.485
No, it was geology and we, I mean my, I guess half of my outfit took it.

26:46.966 --> 26:47.908
Any other easy ones?

26:52.457 --> 26:55.343
Were there any special courses for athletes?

26:57.095 --> 27:08.596
No I can't recall it because I remember athletes being mixed in with the student, you know within the regular courses like marketing, I mean like the basketball player Broussard.

27:09.237 --> 27:09.898
Carol Broussard.

27:09.918 --> 27:10.019
Yeah.

27:10.199 --> 27:11.962
He was in some of my classes.

27:12.002 --> 27:12.984
He was a business major.

27:13.725 --> 27:16.510
And I remember him going through with us through the four years.

27:16.751 --> 27:19.075
I don't recall that they had special courses.

27:19.235 --> 27:20.638
And they did, I didn't know about them.

27:21.192 --> 27:31.438
Were there, in all of your years, were there some celebrity students, people, kids that everybody knew because of who their daddy was?

27:35.198 --> 27:35.679
No.

27:37.402 --> 27:39.947
Not that I, outside of Rudder.

27:40.388 --> 27:44.515
Rudder I think had a son that was, but that was it.

27:44.535 --> 27:46.178
But nobody really paid much attention.

27:46.299 --> 27:47.260
Or maybe I didn't.

27:47.862 --> 27:48.883
I don't think anybody did.

27:48.904 --> 27:51.749
Yeah, we really, I mean he was just one of the guys, you know.

27:52.510 --> 27:55.776
President Rudder got here about the same time you did.

27:56.438 --> 27:57.780
What did you all think of him?

27:58.064 --> 27:59.265
Well everybody liked him.

27:59.505 --> 27:59.786
Why?

27:59.966 --> 28:21.167
Because I think he was the type of person that came down and he wasn't like away, I mean he was a short sleeve type president that wasn't the same like a lot of the academia that are in their ivory tower and didn't want to spend much time with the student body.

28:21.687 --> 28:26.772
He was more in with the student body and everybody kind of really liked him.

28:27.376 --> 28:42.425
The most unpopular thing was when they did that, we were going what in our 75th year and they did that century study and they were having the century consulate that spent time here.

28:42.686 --> 28:45.030
I was a senior, I was a senior.

28:45.010 --> 28:48.374
But, I mean, up to that time, everything was going all right.

28:48.895 --> 29:14.106
But when the Century Council came in and they were doing the study, you started hearing rumors about the fact that they were going to, no compulsory corps, the women were going to be admitted, and there were going to be some changes that, as an old corps and old ags or whatever, they were really upset, and you as an Aggie in the A&M should really not let it happen.

29:14.542 --> 29:16.490
It really wasn't a concern of mine.

29:17.254 --> 29:24.163
I thought that was probably the best way they had to go at the time because the university or the college was not going to grow.

29:24.413 --> 29:26.055
I mean we were losing too many students.

29:26.295 --> 29:31.300
I mean you could see that 40% of freshman classes just can't exist.

29:31.320 --> 29:50.539
But anyway, I remember the Century Council was doing their study and when they got through, what they would do, they assigned a senior to one of the members of the council and you took them wherever you wanted to go on the campus and then you would go back and

29:50.992 --> 29:57.498
And if he had a drill-in ceremony type activity, then you would be with him at the drill-in ceremony.

29:57.579 --> 29:58.840
And I'm going to tell you this.

29:59.601 --> 30:01.442
This was really kind of crazy.

30:02.563 --> 30:03.244
I don't remember.

30:03.324 --> 30:05.867
This guy was maybe the class of 1930-something.

30:07.068 --> 30:10.431
And he's kind of a redneck guy.

30:11.152 --> 30:14.856
And he's standing there watching the troops march by, going to the mess hall.

30:15.877 --> 30:17.218
And he says,

30:18.987 --> 30:23.672
asked me about what I felt about the core being non-compulsory.

30:23.692 --> 30:27.477
And I said, well, if it's going to happen, it's going to happen, you know.

30:27.497 --> 30:28.658
There's nothing we can do about it.

30:29.479 --> 30:32.403
And he said, well, how do you feel about women coming to school?

30:32.463 --> 30:39.250
I said, well, I mean, there's nothing that I can really offer you that, I mean, I don't see a problem with it myself.

30:39.991 --> 30:44.016
And he says, well, how about blacks coming to the school?

30:46.257 --> 30:50.664
I said, I think they should be allowed here just like anybody else.

30:50.744 --> 30:52.887
I said, sir, what class are you?

30:52.907 --> 30:54.569
And he told me it was 1930s somewhere.

30:54.830 --> 31:02.481
And he said, I said, well how would you have felt when you were here if your roommate would have been a Mexican American?

31:05.826 --> 31:06.807
And he didn't say anything.

31:09.471 --> 31:13.277
If there had been a vote by the student body at that time,
