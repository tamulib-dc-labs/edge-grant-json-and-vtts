WEBVTT

00:02.630 --> 00:03.952
and pressure and so forth.

00:06.516 --> 00:15.249
New hires comes in the winter and spring weeks?

00:17.973 --> 00:19.155
The paperwork, yes.

00:19.175 --> 00:19.716
That's what I mean.

00:19.736 --> 00:20.016
Yes.

00:20.377 --> 00:30.392
The physical people show up here usually about the first week in August, and we will have our new faculty orientation

00:30.372 --> 00:32.915
August 20th and 21st this year.

00:32.955 --> 00:36.680
Describe the dean of faculty's task there.

00:37.861 --> 00:38.222
Yes.

00:38.342 --> 00:47.333
The first year I was here, I pretty much sat back and watched the spectacle because it was so close to time for it to happen, you know.

00:48.154 --> 00:51.739
And Ann has done this for years and she was very well organized.

00:52.580 --> 01:02.190
But I have continued to tinker with it from year to year because whatever we do, it never quite seems perfect, you know?

01:02.810 --> 01:10.959
Pretty good, but gee, if only we'd had this session before that session instead of after or something like that.

01:10.999 --> 01:15.624
And so each year, it will vary a little bit.

01:16.264 --> 01:17.085
This year,

01:17.740 --> 01:33.499
We are reducing from two and a half days to two days because I know how busy the new people are, and I could see the drift off, and I felt like if we could hold them for two full days, that ought to be enough.

01:33.559 --> 01:36.583
But boy, it's hard to get in what we need to get in.

01:37.103 --> 01:41.048
About what percentage of the new faculty actually participate in these?

01:41.163 --> 01:44.127
Oh, I think three quarters of them.

01:44.447 --> 01:46.690
Yeah, we have pretty darn good attendance.

01:46.790 --> 01:51.035
And the ones who show up usually seem very glad.

01:51.095 --> 01:56.562
And we often hear people say, oh, I didn't want to do this.

01:58.064 --> 02:01.087
I made myself do it, and then I was glad I did it.

02:01.708 --> 02:05.313
So I think it's a very worthwhile thing to do.

02:06.214 --> 02:09.718
The dean of faculties is also charged with

02:10.255 --> 02:14.428
and development of academic administrators, development experiences.

02:15.390 --> 02:20.626
And I think that's what I feel I've done least well at.

02:20.646 --> 02:24.197
And I'm still searching for a good venue.

02:24.312 --> 02:27.535
Which, what level of academic administration?

02:27.555 --> 02:38.545
Department heads, associate deans, deans, and sometimes somebody like the new director of the press will join in, and very appropriately so, and we're glad.

02:38.625 --> 02:42.129
But mostly department heads, associate deans, and deans.

02:44.531 --> 02:52.058
Last year, we went away from a format of two full days of a parade of talking heads.

02:53.135 --> 02:55.139
which gets kind of deadly dull, right?

02:55.600 --> 02:59.869
Even if the talking heads individually are very bright and engaging, it gets dull.

03:00.932 --> 03:11.093
We went to a seminar format, a topical seminar format, inviting all of the academic administrators and not just the new ones.

03:11.427 --> 03:17.939
And that makes for good conversations, the experienced people talking to the less experienced people, et cetera, et cetera.

03:18.680 --> 03:20.744
We still have a problem of attendance.

03:21.225 --> 03:22.708
These are very busy people.

03:24.311 --> 03:28.038
And not as many attend as I think should attend.

03:29.681 --> 03:33.047
But in going to the seminar series, I think we missed something.

03:34.006 --> 03:36.311
I think the new people need a jump start.

03:37.453 --> 03:51.120
And this fall, we are going to have a one-day toolkit of essentials for the new ones, deliberately keeping to a minimal number of topics to try to avoid that.

03:51.607 --> 03:53.352
parade through effect.

03:54.595 --> 03:56.621
And we are going to have just three topics.

03:56.701 --> 04:06.628
We are going to have someone from the general counsel's office to come talk about essential legal concepts that you need a firm grip on.

04:07.891 --> 04:32.924
I'm going to have someone from what used to be the university auditing office, which is now the management and, I forget what Charlie Clark's office is now called, but management advising office, let's call it that for the moment, to talk about good fiscal management and how to have such a good fiscal operation that you won't need to be audited.

04:33.985 --> 04:34.246
Okay?

04:35.027 --> 04:37.510
That's the morning and in the afternoon.

04:38.063 --> 04:44.096
I'm going to march through the university policies that pertain to faculty members.

04:45.138 --> 04:52.714
So I want these new people to actually look at those and not to be discovering later, oh, I was supposed to do this and so.

04:52.998 --> 04:54.944
Oh, there's a grievance committee.

04:55.004 --> 04:56.689
I didn't know that, et cetera.

04:57.732 --> 05:03.508
So we're going to try to do the jump start and then have our seminar series.

05:03.589 --> 05:08.222
And if we can't make it appealing enough for people to attend, then we need to make it more appealing.

05:09.181 --> 05:18.452
Let me, as an editorial note, add what we first began to attempt as new faculty orientation when I was dean of faculties.

05:20.295 --> 05:29.426
When Dr. Williams told me I would be responsible for it, I complained about how it was done when I was a new faculty member my first year in the fall of 59.

05:31.028 --> 05:35.273
We had what I considered like boot camp lectures.

05:35.725 --> 05:39.714
by President Rutter telling us what we would and would not do.

05:39.734 --> 05:46.709
The Corps commander came and directed us around like we were a bunch of fish in the Corps and so forth.

05:47.932 --> 05:53.143
And pretty soon, Dr. Williams said, well, if you think you know what it ought to be, you bring me a plan.

05:53.697 --> 06:14.490
So what we came up with for that period was a one day in which we asked both husband and wife, whether they were both faculty members or not, but husband and wife to come dressed casually and let's begin at 8.30 and we would welcome them

06:14.470 --> 06:24.944
introduce them a little bit to Aggie traditions, but much of the day we would spend in visiting some of the interesting and sometimes remote parts of the campus.

06:25.725 --> 06:38.442
Go to veterinary surgery, go to the top of the meteorology building, go to the inner parts of the library, to the MSC, to the Rudder Auditorium.

06:38.923 --> 06:42.047
And then in that, at about 4 o'clock,

06:42.685 --> 06:58.710
Then they were to come back at night to a formal dinner, and Dr. Williams, who was a superb speaker, would then speak that evening about this institution and what he dreamed it would be.

06:58.730 --> 07:09.486
I, as the master of ceremonies, would always end up saying, our hope, ladies and gentlemen, is that this day will help

07:09.820 --> 07:17.890
to cause you on the way home from this day of activity to turn to each other and say, you know,

07:18.697 --> 07:20.078
I'm real glad that we're here.

07:20.839 --> 07:22.280
That's a wonderful purpose.

07:22.480 --> 07:36.552
Because I said, if we can have you feeling positive about this institution on your first day, then there is a good chance of it being a happy, happy routine.

07:36.792 --> 07:39.395
Well, I may quote you at this year's orientation.

07:39.415 --> 07:40.335
I like that.

07:40.355 --> 07:41.096
I'd be happy to.

07:41.376 --> 07:43.578
And if I can ever help, please let me know.

07:45.880 --> 07:46.300
Let's see.

07:46.841 --> 07:48.282
Have you ever been sued?

07:48.262 --> 07:49.343
No.

07:52.066 --> 07:58.213
Has anyone accused you informally of not giving them fair treatment as dean of faculties?

08:00.075 --> 08:03.098
I don't think so.

08:03.118 --> 08:05.341
Not everybody's always happy, of course.

08:06.582 --> 08:18.015
When I took this job, people would always mention the lawsuit idea and would say, don't ask yourself whether you'll be sued only when, because you will be.

08:18.738 --> 08:19.579
Haven't been yet.

08:19.899 --> 08:22.603
To whom do you turn for legal advice?

08:24.185 --> 08:27.308
Usually Dena Wallace in the Office of General Counsel.

08:27.388 --> 08:31.433
She has the title Associate General Counsel.

08:32.074 --> 08:34.437
I used always to call Scott Kelly.

08:34.457 --> 08:41.586
Scott Kelly... Was he on the... And he's still there.

08:41.606 --> 08:43.167
At the Counsel's Office?

08:43.207 --> 08:43.648
Oh, yes.

08:43.628 --> 08:47.031
But Scott, I don't know.

08:47.151 --> 08:59.303
I just think he's more and more involved in system-level things, and Dena is the one who's primarily associated with the university.

09:02.026 --> 09:07.431
In fact, you are responsible for about how many faculty?

09:07.951 --> 09:08.512
About 2,200.

09:08.832 --> 09:10.834
About 2,200.

09:11.287 --> 09:14.992
And of those, about how many are tenure-track?

09:15.012 --> 09:17.255
1,710 as of last fall.

09:18.737 --> 09:20.199
Okay.

09:20.219 --> 09:28.390
And compared to other institutions of this size and of this sort, are our numbers comparatively typical?

09:31.193 --> 09:37.041
Our numbers are much smaller than they should be for an institution of the quality we are.

09:37.342 --> 09:38.283
Number of faculty?

09:38.443 --> 09:41.267
Our number of faculty in proportion to the number of students.

09:41.287 --> 09:44.912
We are under-facultied for our size of student body.

09:45.613 --> 09:51.520
And that was studied very carefully in the Vision 2020 project, and it's clearly demonstrated.

09:52.441 --> 09:54.364
Boy, but that's a hard one to change.

09:55.826 --> 10:04.176
As you have worked with the provost, what are, does he have any pet peeves?

10:04.236 --> 10:05.458
Does he have any

10:06.367 --> 10:10.951
Does he have any things you know that he's deeply concerned about?

10:10.991 --> 10:26.204
Pet peeves and no-no's, I think the one way in which he probably gets irritated with me, though he doesn't show it much at all, I have to look closely, is that my email messages and memos are too long.

10:26.244 --> 10:27.746
He wishes I were more terse.

10:29.427 --> 10:36.373
I think that Ron is very interested in

10:36.623 --> 10:53.130
really quality work and he wants us to find a way to bring the best quality faculty and to keep the best quality faculty and he doesn't want us to get tangled up in red tape.

10:53.397 --> 10:56.242
ever to the point that it prevents us from doing that.

10:57.424 --> 11:00.109
And, of course, I share those values.

11:00.129 --> 11:08.884
And if he had to give a priority to teaching research or service, where would it fall?

11:12.149 --> 11:17.278
I will say it's a tribute to him that I have trouble answering that.

11:17.495 --> 11:20.439
There's not one that's easily an obvious.

11:20.459 --> 11:21.120
You think it's valid.

11:21.140 --> 11:27.428
Yeah, it would certainly be teaching or research, but between those two, I'm stymied.

11:28.870 --> 11:34.096
In your years, do you remember any midnight calls or weekend calls of emergencies?

11:36.359 --> 11:39.603
Those, no, not really.

11:39.704 --> 11:47.113
Those usually go to the college dean, not to the dean of faculties.

11:48.865 --> 11:58.316
And, in fact, only day before yesterday I had a call from a department who had, where the associate head had gotten an emergency call on Sunday over the weekend.

11:58.837 --> 12:04.543
Well, he didn't call and fill me in on it until Monday because he didn't need to.

12:05.644 --> 12:08.528
College person took care of it.

12:09.709 --> 12:16.577
I remember very early in my service placing a night call to the provost when it came

12:17.131 --> 12:28.382
to my awareness, which I should have been aware sooner, that the Women Faculty Network reception had been scheduled for Rosh Hashanah.

12:30.044 --> 12:36.630
And it wasn't until about three days before that until we realized what a bad thing we had done.

12:36.650 --> 12:43.797
And we had a call from someone saying, you need to cancel this.

12:44.485 --> 12:53.956
And at that point, we decided it was too close, that we just couldn't, that more people would be discomfited that way.

12:54.016 --> 13:03.447
But I don't like that answer because the minority persons in a group are the ones who most need protection for their rights.

13:03.907 --> 13:10.695
And we've tried to be very, very careful about this since then.

13:11.047 --> 13:18.164
So you held it on Rosh Hashanah, but was there an apology at the event?

13:19.768 --> 13:28.870
I don't remember that there was out loud, but I conferred with the provost about whether we should cancel or not.

13:29.761 --> 13:31.845
It may not even have been three days ahead.

13:31.905 --> 13:34.030
It may have been like two days ahead.

13:34.070 --> 13:37.697
And it was not the main day of Rosh Hashanah.

13:37.717 --> 13:45.593
You know, more orthodox observers of the faith observe a longer period, and it was in this extended

13:45.573 --> 13:47.577
period.

13:48.839 --> 13:59.077
We were not so inept as to have scheduled it on the primary day, but I wished that we had not on one of the secondary days.

13:59.197 --> 14:04.847
All right, now that causes me to jump to this question.

14:04.827 --> 14:09.333
And I'll preface it with a Fred McClure statement.

14:09.353 --> 14:16.062
One day I was talking to Fred, you know, Fred, why do we have difficulty recruiting black faculty?

14:16.963 --> 14:24.793
He said, because there is not a clear black community in this town with black professionals.

14:25.786 --> 14:40.133
What are Texas A&M's major obstacles in recruiting minority, international, people of other religious backgrounds?

14:40.173 --> 14:42.537
What are our handicaps there?

14:45.122 --> 14:49.009
Well, certainly Fred was right that the community

14:49.580 --> 14:50.783
makes a difference.

14:52.286 --> 14:59.160
It is a strength of a community that we are very family oriented in this community.

14:59.240 --> 15:04.431
That's wonderful for families, but that makes it hard for single faculty.

15:05.032 --> 15:08.179
So almost anything will have

15:08.159 --> 15:09.200
It's reverse.

15:10.582 --> 15:19.411
Homogeneity in a community is probably great if you are strongly group identified and you're part of the majority.

15:19.451 --> 15:22.354
But for anyone who's different, it's not.

15:22.975 --> 15:31.383
And also, homogeneity in an academic community doesn't serve intellectual purposes well.

15:32.024 --> 15:35.888
We function better in our learning, in our teaching,

15:36.526 --> 15:42.835
in our studying, in our investigating, when we have a great variety of voices.

15:43.677 --> 15:47.683
A great variety of voices usually come to you in a great variety of human packages.

15:48.464 --> 15:49.586
And so we need that.

15:49.846 --> 15:51.048
What's holding us back?

15:51.689 --> 16:00.842
Yes, the community, which has historically been an overwhelmingly white community in its more affluent and professional levels.

16:01.143 --> 16:03.867
And one would hope to change that.

16:04.420 --> 16:11.992
in the family orientation and the varieties of leisure time activities here.

16:12.032 --> 16:14.436
Those hold us back.

16:15.317 --> 16:28.318
I think we have sometimes in our good intentions not listened enough to our minority faculty members themselves and I have

16:29.092 --> 16:38.846
The past two summers had focus group meetings with all of our African American faculty and all our Hispanic faculty who care to attend.

16:39.587 --> 16:45.816
And we've talked as frankly and openly as people can talk in a group situation.

16:46.056 --> 16:46.897
Good turnouts?

16:47.638 --> 16:48.439
Good turnouts.

16:48.900 --> 16:50.823
Better last summer than this summer.

16:51.123 --> 16:54.728
I think people were surprised and it was the first time.

16:55.332 --> 17:11.372
smaller numbers this summer, but I think we have often tried to figure out how we could be more effective in recruitment and retention of minorities without asking the minority faculty members themselves.

17:12.313 --> 17:14.175
What about Asian faculty?

17:15.417 --> 17:17.459
Do they, how do they feel here?

17:17.499 --> 17:18.100
Do you know?

17:20.493 --> 17:31.248
I have not had the group discussions as opposed to individual discussions with Asian faculty that I've had with African American and Hispanic.

17:31.969 --> 17:40.000
I think within the university community itself, our Asian faculty usually feel very comfortable.

17:40.401 --> 17:40.842
That's what I thought.

17:40.942 --> 17:48.913
Many are very conspicuously successful, and we are so fortunate and happy that they are here.

17:49.636 --> 17:52.360
Out in the community, I don't know.

17:52.380 --> 17:57.888
I think Asian faculty usually do well.

17:58.068 --> 18:00.030
Asian graduate students, I'm not sure.

18:00.051 --> 18:02.634
I worry about them a little bit.

18:03.195 --> 18:08.703
I have heard rumors of hostile statements and actions that bother me a lot.

18:14.110 --> 18:17.635
Goofy things that the dean of faculty has been confronted with.

18:19.657 --> 18:20.999
Goofy things.

18:21.059 --> 18:21.540
Silly.

18:21.740 --> 18:22.401
Goofy.

18:24.243 --> 18:29.430
I know you're not going to believe this, but... Oh, goodness.

18:29.671 --> 18:33.315
I should have been thinking of funny things.

18:33.636 --> 18:34.597
No.

18:38.523 --> 18:40.045
More sad things.

18:40.465 --> 18:40.986
Such as?

18:42.087 --> 18:43.770
People's illnesses.

18:44.831 --> 18:47.014
People's troubles in their lives.

18:47.602 --> 18:49.204
That makes this job hard.

18:50.666 --> 18:55.413
If you care about people, it makes them hard, it makes it hard.

18:56.114 --> 19:13.457
We had a faculty member, I won't say in what part of the university, who, I'm not sure how open to be, you may want to edit this out, who had prostate cancer.

19:14.652 --> 19:20.821
and who was wetting his pants in front of his classroom, and students were laughing at him.

19:20.841 --> 19:24.467
And you see how that gets me now.

19:25.749 --> 19:36.766
And he, well, yeah, those sad stories come to mind, and I wish that I had the funny ones more in my mind.

19:37.166 --> 19:38.989
That would make better oral history.

19:39.728 --> 19:44.682
Right now, one that I remember, a goofy one, this is another editorial note.

19:45.404 --> 19:51.983
Back when we were reviewing, I would meet with

19:53.161 --> 20:03.946
prospective faculty and spend about a half hour trying to describe Texas A&M, what it actually is, as honestly as I could describe it, and what we hoped it was going to be.

20:05.629 --> 20:12.064
As I looked at this man's resume, I noticed that he had done his PhD at the University of Virginia.

20:13.107 --> 20:20.697
And so when he came in, I said something about what a pleasure it was to do research at the Alderman Library.

20:21.539 --> 20:23.221
And that didn't register with him.

20:23.962 --> 20:24.122
Oh.

20:25.564 --> 20:31.432
And so I then referred to the grounds, and that didn't either.

20:34.036 --> 20:40.144
I then talked about the lawn and the East Range and the West Range, and that didn't either.

20:40.917 --> 20:51.331
So I then made up the names of three of my, quote, friends in the English department at the University of Virginia, and he said he knew them very, very well.

20:51.351 --> 20:53.013
Oh, my word, Haskell.

20:53.414 --> 21:01.404
So after he left, I called the Department of English and told them that it was not my job to review the capability of anyone.

21:01.444 --> 21:02.266
That was their job.

21:02.646 --> 21:05.390
But this is what had happened, that something was wrong.

21:05.430 --> 21:06.912
They needed to check.

21:06.932 --> 21:08.434
They called the University of Virginia.

21:08.554 --> 21:10.857
This man had never been heard of there.

21:11.242 --> 21:17.139
that he had submitted some phony, a phony resume.

21:18.343 --> 21:20.088
Did you ever encounter anything like that?

21:20.409 --> 21:21.412
Oh, my word, no.

21:21.813 --> 21:24.441
That's absolutely amazing.

21:25.147 --> 21:36.398
I did encounter once an attempted hire in one of our departments where I was not convinced this was the quality of person we ought to be hiring.

21:36.538 --> 21:51.272
And it's only with fear and trembling that I call a dean or department head and say that because they will be very quick to, well, and rightly so, to perceive interference.

21:51.252 --> 21:55.779
But this time I did kind of call and shyly indicate that.

21:56.139 --> 22:00.826
And the department head expressed a great desire to discuss it with me.

22:01.007 --> 22:10.120
And he arrived at my door bearing two big file boxes of applications and proceeded to sort of go through them one at a time.

22:10.721 --> 22:18.593
And he demonstrated to me by the weight of paper that they had indeed hired the best person.

22:19.349 --> 22:30.656
Have you felt consistently positive about the search processes that the departments have used to recruit faculty?

22:30.676 --> 22:31.097
No.

22:31.938 --> 22:33.280
Mostly positive, yes.

22:34.261 --> 22:44.973
But there have been a couple of times that I have heard of things being said in search committee meetings that if true were not appropriate.

22:45.293 --> 22:56.005
And fortunately, in those cases, I've always had a dean or an associate dean that I knew well enough that I could call and say,

22:55.985 --> 23:05.679
This is what has come to me, and I hope it's not true, and it probably isn't true, but you need to know it, and you need to look into it.

23:06.200 --> 23:15.373
As A&M is recruiting faculty in today's real world, what are our strengths and our weaknesses in trying to recruit outstanding faculty?

23:15.393 --> 23:22.524
Our strengths are the wonderful faculty that we have here now, and people know that.

23:23.305 --> 23:25.468
People want to come work.

23:26.073 --> 23:27.314
with our people.

23:28.075 --> 23:29.817
And I can give you examples of that.

23:30.998 --> 23:48.715
Our weaknesses are, and this statement would not be well received by everybody, that people are still suspicious that we are extremely military in our nature.

23:49.516 --> 23:55.962
Women are very suspicious that we are still extremely male dominated.

23:55.942 --> 24:11.718
I spoke with a woman, a candidate not long back, who said to me, when people at the national meeting in my field heard that I was applying to Texas A&M, they took me aside and said, you do not want to go there.

24:11.758 --> 24:14.461
Now I want you to tell me why they were wrong.

24:16.323 --> 24:20.667
She did not accept our offer, by the way, but at least she thought about it carefully.

24:21.035 --> 24:22.281
And she did get an offer.

24:22.301 --> 24:28.328
In general, is Texas A&M seen as a school that is moving forward?

24:28.409 --> 24:36.258
Yes, I do think that that's true, and we are seen as a school that is well-funded compared to many institutions.

24:37.360 --> 24:46.811
Now, we always know that we have less money than we have ideas and things we want to do, but it would be pretty bad if it were the other way around, wouldn't it?

24:49.414 --> 24:56.222
What, with what other separate land-grant colleges would you think we should most

24:56.827 --> 25:01.213
appropriately compared as our peers?

25:02.475 --> 25:16.995
Michigan State is, usually we would be considered not quite as good an institution as Michigan State, but that's not necessarily so, and we ought to be winning that comparison.

25:18.297 --> 25:25.888
North Carolina State, we ought to be winning that comparison, and sometimes we are.

25:25.868 --> 25:29.195
And after that, we're clearly better than anybody else.

25:29.215 --> 25:32.924
Yeah, I'm groping for where I'd go next.

25:33.004 --> 25:40.140
Now, in Vision 2020, our goal is to be one of the top ten publics.

25:40.300 --> 25:40.741
That's right.

25:41.623 --> 25:42.645
Reckon we can do that?

25:44.465 --> 25:45.027
I don't know.

25:45.167 --> 25:57.040
It's going to be touch and go, because the other institutions out there, not only the ones that are, you'd say, are top 10 publics now, but the ones that are in the next 10.

25:57.256 --> 25:58.599
They're also moving.

26:00.543 --> 26:11.886
And who knows who's going to have the good fortune and the good wisdom and the resources and everything it takes to be in that select group in 2020.

26:13.349 --> 26:17.037
But the effort to be there is itself beneficial.

26:17.017 --> 26:19.300
Whatever.

26:20.001 --> 26:22.063
You see that as an appropriate goal.

26:22.424 --> 26:23.685
Absolutely, I do.

26:24.206 --> 26:25.928
And possibly a doable one.

26:29.933 --> 26:42.288
In the years that you've been here, both as dean of faculties and earlier, how has this institution changed, for better or for worse?

26:42.589 --> 26:44.391
The liberal arts are stronger.

26:45.265 --> 26:50.190
There is more of a consensus that we need the fine arts.

26:51.171 --> 26:59.721
There's certainly not a consensus yet that we can build them effectively in the short term because the huge resource demands.

27:00.322 --> 27:04.246
But certainly there's a consensus that we need the arts.

27:04.306 --> 27:09.872
And when I came here, I do not think there was.

27:11.185 --> 27:25.548
I think the position of women in the faculty has improved, although still there's some grading now and then.

27:25.568 --> 27:33.039
And women are still suspicious and not always feeling well-treated.

27:33.140 --> 27:35.303
But on the whole, I think we're doing better.

27:36.329 --> 27:37.632
in that respect.

27:38.513 --> 27:41.840
We have greatly increased our programs.

27:43.443 --> 27:45.848
That is, new programs have come online.

27:46.950 --> 27:53.764
We have proven to be better at inventing new programs than we are at discontinuing any old programs.

27:54.301 --> 27:57.405
And we need to watch for both of them.

27:57.425 --> 27:59.388
I bet we're not going to go on to another tape.

27:59.468 --> 28:01.090
I bet we need to be over it.

28:01.110 --> 28:02.091
We've got a little bit more.

28:02.111 --> 28:05.876
Just a little bit.

28:06.317 --> 28:13.126
Are there any things that we ought to review about termination, discontinuing?

28:13.146 --> 28:13.867
Of programs?

28:15.870 --> 28:16.090
Mm-hmm.

28:16.643 --> 28:22.590
I think we ought to be looking at degree production and looking at it real hard.

28:22.630 --> 28:29.098
And that doesn't necessarily mean that if you only produce five degrees a year in something that it's not worth having.

28:29.118 --> 28:31.001
It doesn't necessarily mean that.

28:31.882 --> 28:37.549
But we are stewards for the people of Texas, and we need to be looking at that.

28:37.769 --> 28:38.951
Things do change.

28:40.593 --> 28:46.600
Do we give enough attention to that part of the world that's south of us?

28:47.845 --> 28:48.746
As an institution?

28:49.667 --> 28:50.348
To the valley?

28:50.868 --> 28:54.872
No, well, I'm talking about all of America, south and river.

28:54.892 --> 28:56.114
Oh, you're really looking.

28:56.374 --> 28:56.474
Yeah.

28:56.854 --> 28:58.316
Do we give enough attention to that?

28:58.396 --> 29:01.479
Oh, I, don't get me started on that.

29:02.180 --> 29:14.072
I think one of the things that I would most love to see happen at this institution, all right, is when we have our capital campaign, that we would get

29:16.212 --> 29:29.770
Two or three, I mean, I want to be modest in my goals, chairs in border studies, border studies being the emerging or recently emerged name.

29:29.971 --> 29:35.959
This institution has lots of strength in border studies, but it's scattered.

29:37.100 --> 29:38.723
And we could pull it together.

29:38.763 --> 29:40.465
We could be.

29:40.445 --> 29:41.606
a leader in that.

29:41.826 --> 29:42.627
Why aren't we?

29:42.727 --> 29:43.648
I want to see that.

29:45.630 --> 29:51.796
So that's, I have been talking up, and I just think there are multiple benefits to that.

29:51.956 --> 30:07.490
Now, coming out of a liberal arts background, the whole Latin America, Iberian Peninsula debate in the modern languages is a rather more specialized debate than you were talking about, I think.

30:07.590 --> 30:09.372
But it's, it's,

30:09.858 --> 30:32.301
indicative of that whole, that our focus perhaps has been excessively Eurocentric for a long time, and it needs a little more balance, shall we say.

30:32.501 --> 30:38.447
As dean of faculties, you had little, if any, outside interference from a

30:38.579 --> 30:42.106
from a former student, a legislator?

30:42.126 --> 30:42.928
Absolutely.

30:42.948 --> 30:43.569
A board member?

30:44.210 --> 30:44.831
Absolutely.

30:44.851 --> 30:47.917
Nobody ever called and tried to tell you to do this or that?

30:48.258 --> 30:48.499
No.

30:50.422 --> 30:53.348
I've certainly seen that at times

30:53.783 --> 31:04.961
people with connections call the president's office because their neighbor's offspring wasn't satisfied with a professor or something, and those complaints come in.

31:05.803 --> 31:09.970
But have people tried to lean on me to do something?

31:09.990 --> 31:11.011
No, never.

31:11.652 --> 31:15.980
And particularly regarding hires or promotions or anything?

31:16.000 --> 31:16.120
Never.

31:16.440 --> 31:17.762
Absolutely not.

31:17.823 --> 31:18.023
Right.

31:18.103 --> 31:18.884
I never had that.

31:18.904 --> 31:19.926
Never had that.
