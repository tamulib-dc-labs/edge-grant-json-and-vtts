WEBVTT

00:03.541 --> 00:13.459
When

00:03.541 --> 00:13.459
we quit this morning, I believe you had just been 
elected... Yell leader. Yell leader. How did life

00:15.322 --> 00:17.205
change? How did life change? Well, first off, that 
night was crazy. It's a really funny story. My

00:23.456 --> 00:24.659
friends and I talk about it a lot. We're standing 
out there and we're in front of Sully. And the

00:28.128 --> 00:30.752
election commissioner's up behind Celine. She's 
got her little bullhorn. Her name was Ashley

00:32.314 --> 00:34.197
Jenkins, election commissioner that year. No, 
no, no, no. That was my senior year. I don't

00:37.141 --> 00:38.824
remember her name now. Anyway, and we were 
standing there, and it went through all the class

00:38.984 --> 00:48.037
council stuff, and everyone was waiting, and then 
it said junior year leader. Then it got really

00:48.899 --> 00:51.823
quiet, and then all you heard was a riff. Like all 
you got out was a rip. And then just, I mean, it was

00:53.538 --> 00:56.461
just crazy. Pandemonium. And then everyone was 
going nuts. Everyone was crazy. I fell down on the

00:59.625 --> 01:00.546
ground. And they picked me up and they carried me 
over to a fish pond and threw me in and all that kind

01:00.566 --> 01:05.211
of stuff. She read out the total? Mm-hmm. She read 
out the names. Were there any negative reactions

01:10.557 --> 01:15.242
that you could sense? Not that I could hear. Not 
that I could hear. Now, there was. I remember going

01:17.965 --> 01:21.709
after. Well, actually, before I got thrown into 
the pond, I went over to congratulate or at least to

01:22.432 --> 01:36.511
talk to the others that had been elected already 
simply because they, the core block all walks

01:22.432 --> 01:36.511
together over, and so they were all standing next 
to each other. And I went up and tried to talk to

01:36.591 --> 01:39.595
them, and they were still talking. So they weren't 
very open to me at first. And so I remember just kind

01:41.778 --> 01:47.226
of standing there for about ten minutes, just 
waiting for them to quit talking. And then finally

01:48.127 --> 01:50.109
I gave up and went and played. Did... During the 
campaign, did anyone campaign against you, as far

01:51.693 --> 01:59.342
as you know? In the run-offs, probably. In the 
run-offs, they did. Not necessarily against me,

02:03.367 --> 02:06.972
but just because I wasn't in the Corps. But it was 
never an issue with me. I never let it be an issue.

02:13.059 --> 02:17.144
Any phone calls or mail? Once I got elected. I got a 
couple of letters. I got emails. I never got phone

02:21.246 --> 02:21.968
calls. And what was the nature of those? I wasn't 
deserving. I didn't know what I got into. I didn't

02:27.095 --> 02:32.242
know the tradition that A&M was. I remember a 
specific email from a fish in the band, a fish,

02:32.662 --> 02:38.811
which really made me laugh, but a fish in the band 
that said something about You don't know what it's

02:39.635 --> 02:42.179
like to wear the uniform. You don't know what it's 
like to have the white belt. You don't know. And

02:44.522 --> 02:48.348
then you start asking all these questions like, do 
you know so and so? Do you know the people that were

02:48.368 --> 02:50.110
on Cricador? Do you know all that? And it's just 
like simply because I wasn't in the Corps of

02:52.053 --> 02:58.683
Cadets, they felt as though I had no clue what this 
university was about. That bothered me. Alright,

03:01.467 --> 03:03.390
so you get thrown in the pond. Then where else do you 
and your buddies go to celebrate? Actually, we

03:06.755 --> 03:08.157
just go. We were so tired from the two weeks that we 
went to this house. I remember the guy who wants to

03:12.369 --> 03:15.032
be mighty president that year, his name is Will 
Hurd. We went to Will's house and stayed there for

03:16.274 --> 03:21.179
about 30 minutes and then I went home and went to 
sleep. Did, as you looked back at the election,

03:22.240 --> 03:30.369
you were happy and so forth. Did you think in 
retrospect that you and your supporters had done

03:38.697 --> 03:42.883
anything that was original, that was... Very much 
so. Very much so. It's funny now that I've seen

03:44.906 --> 03:52.496
elections two times after I've gone, how 
elections, if something works, everybody's

03:44.906 --> 03:52.496
gonna copy it. And that's what's happened these 
past two years. What have they copied?

03:57.503 --> 04:02.170
Campaigning my freshman year, and the people I ran 
against, it was very as usual. It was very, pretty

04:02.370 --> 04:06.636
much all you had to do was show up, smile, say your 
name, and that's it. And that's all people

04:06.656 --> 04:07.978
expected. If you had a little campaign slogan, 
then that's all you needed. Going to speak, you

04:11.796 --> 04:14.985
just go, say a couple words, and then leave. No one 
ever thought outside the box. No one ever thought

04:16.810 --> 04:22.525
of the fact that maybe I needed to show my true self 
instead of what they're thinking I need to be. So I

04:22.910 --> 04:24.933
saw a lot of that. There was actually a candidate 
who ran for, who ran for junior Yale leader, didn't

04:24.953 --> 04:39.654
win, and then ran for senior Yale leader who very 
much so had the exact same campaign that I did my

04:24.953 --> 04:39.654
freshman year, I mean sophomore year, even down to 
the stuff that he handed out. As far as you could

04:40.756 --> 04:48.326
tell, the turnout tended to include what groups of 
folks? Who turned out and voted? Freshman girls.

04:52.711 --> 04:54.935
Freshman girls, okay. Freshman girls voted a lot. 
And the core. The core voted a lot. And then

04:58.601 --> 05:01.226
involved people. Do you have any idea whether 
campus residents voted more than off campus? They

05:08.639 --> 05:11.284
certainly did just because they saw it a lot more. 
If you live on campus, you're walking around

05:11.885 --> 05:13.648
campus a lot more. So you're going to notice, okay, 
it's voting today. What about the Greek

05:16.172 --> 05:17.655
organizations? They did if they were behind 
someone. I know the sororities did a lot. See, the

05:21.852 --> 05:27.179
funny thing about Yale leaders is A&M has a higher 
student body turnout than anywhere in the nation

05:21.852 --> 05:27.179
because of Yale leaders. I'd say almost hands 
down. And then the runoff, how many other runoff

05:30.443 --> 05:36.331
races were there that year? Big ones, there was 
just the Yale leaders and then the student body

05:36.952 --> 05:40.056
president. Junior Yale leader and then student 
body president. How soon did you and the other Yale

05:43.387 --> 05:49.576
leaders, newly elected Yale leaders, get 
together? The next day. Describe that. It was

05:52.821 --> 05:54.083
nuts, actually. We went to Hensel Park over there 
on South College. I'm going to remember this so

05:57.648 --> 06:03.336
well because I got there early because I didn't 
want to be late. taking the shoe polish off my car

06:03.839 --> 06:30.893
just because we had shoe polish all over my car so i 
was taking that off my car and they drive up and

06:03.839 --> 06:30.893
they're all in the same car and so i'm like all right 
great it's already started just because i i are

06:03.839 --> 06:30.893
people had already warned me they're like okay now 
you realize it's going to be you and them for a while

06:03.839 --> 06:30.893
so we go out to inso park and we're talking and it's 
very obvious that they didn't think i would do a

06:03.839 --> 06:30.893
good job right off the bat very obvious simply 
because it felt like they were babying me very very

06:31.480 --> 06:49.742
much which is fine i mean they had they didn't know 
me i didn't know them and so of course they were

06:31.480 --> 06:49.742
going to take every precaution that they needed to 
but i remember walking away from that meeting

06:31.480 --> 06:49.742
going well they don't trust me at all now there were 
how many Five yell leaders. Five yell leaders.

06:53.407 --> 06:54.969
Four corps cadets and me. All right. And seniors 
and? Three seniors, two juniors. Two juniors. And

06:59.877 --> 07:04.404
how many of the seniors had been junior yell 
leaders? Two. So the two junior yell leaders. Had

07:07.469 --> 07:08.230
been reelected. Okay. And had there been many 
civilian yell leaders before you? A handful, I'd

07:15.153 --> 07:19.600
say in all 12, 14 maybe, in the history of the 
L-Leader. There used to be something called a

07:21.022 --> 07:34.544
veteran spot that they would hold, withhold for 
that, but that was when it went to non-compulsory

07:21.022 --> 07:34.544
Corps of Cadets, then they took that away. In your 
years at A&M, have you ever heard of any serious

07:35.625 --> 07:41.214
consideration of a female? One ran last year. A 
woman ran last year, actually. Her name is Toni.

07:46.866 --> 07:49.150
And how many votes, how well did she? She got 1,200 
votes. She was running as a junior or senior? As a

07:53.035 --> 07:53.356
senior. She was running for senior the other day. 
Was she in the corps or something? She was senior.

07:58.684 --> 07:59.645
Have there been other women? There were actually 
women in 1991 who got third and fourth place. They

08:05.714 --> 08:07.857
actually beat guys. Because imagine what a 
revolution that will be. Yes, it will be. All

08:13.510 --> 08:17.076
right, so that first meeting was comparatively 
cold. And did anyone say anything that was cold?

08:23.447 --> 08:25.491
No, they didn't. They didn't at all, actually. 
They were very positive. I mean, not positive per

08:28.132 --> 08:31.776
se, but it was just very informatory. Look, okay, 
this is this. This is what you have to do. This is why

08:34.799 --> 08:35.720
we're doing this. This is what it's for. This is 
what the schedule's like. It was more just like,

08:39.043 --> 08:40.965
okay, this is what you're getting into. And the 
head yell leader is elected, so? It's that yell

08:45.629 --> 08:47.971
leaders are elected. The head yell leader is 
picked from the yell leaders. By? A council, a

08:52.696 --> 08:54.718
board. And so when you had that first get together, 
had that decision already been made? No. Okay. So

09:02.716 --> 09:05.480
one of the three seniors was going to be the head. 
Right, then what was the next event? The next event

09:09.725 --> 09:17.635
or the next time that we got together is I remember 
meeting Jeff Bailey who ended up being the head

09:09.725 --> 09:17.635
yell leader because he had a uniform for me. I got 
the uniform, and he taught me how to roll the

09:18.762 --> 09:26.813
sleeves in the parking lot out in front of Jason's 
Deli over there on Texas and George Bush. I

09:26.834 --> 09:32.241
remember very, very well that we were sitting 
there, and he taught me how to roll the sleeves. No,

09:32.261 --> 09:33.944
that's where we met because he was getting his hair 
cut. Then we went over to the cleaners, and that's

09:33.964 --> 09:37.028
where we got the uniform. He introduced me to the 
guy who does our laundry, all that kind of stuff.

09:39.952 --> 09:40.834
Then we went out in the parking lot. He taught me how 
to roll the sleeve. I was like, okay, this is how you

09:42.456 --> 09:43.678
do it. So how many uniforms are provided? You're 
provided with three. But you've got to order them

09:48.361 --> 09:50.504
after you get elected, obviously. So it's pretty 
much when you first get elected, you just try and

09:51.666 --> 09:55.132
find whatever you can fit into. And the three 
uniforms are identical. Yes, they're all

09:59.398 --> 10:00.380
identical. Make believe that I had never seen the 
uniform. Describe what they are. The white

10:04.406 --> 10:15.043
uniform is, take what you see in cartoons, what 
painters wear, white pants, white shirt, a white

10:04.406 --> 10:15.043
belt with a brass buckle, The sleeves are rolled 
up, and then you have a maroon A&M stitched onto the

10:15.142 --> 10:21.934
left pocket on the shirt. They're not full-length 
sleeves, though, are they? No, they are

10:23.737 --> 10:24.538
full-length. We rolled them up. It's just like 
that shirt right there, and you just roll it up. And

10:30.048 --> 10:37.080
is the shirt

10:30.048 --> 10:37.080
knitted or woven? In other words, that's knitted. 
It's woven. It's woven like this. Yes, it's like

10:42.198 --> 10:42.879
that. It's a work wear. We ordered it out of the 
JCPenney catalog. And has a small insignia on the

10:46.865 --> 10:49.589
pocket. And that's the only identifier. Only 
identifier. And then what shoes do? Maroon shoes.

10:55.518 --> 10:56.299
We wear maroon shoes. And that's actually really 
funny. We can never find maroon shoes. Something

10:59.684 --> 11:00.706
because no one makes them. 60 years ago, 
everywhere made maroon shoes. But now, maroon is

11:02.568 --> 11:05.633
not the end color, I guess. So it's always a big 
deal. And I have size 14 shoe. I have a real big foot.

11:10.340 --> 11:13.166
And when you first get elected, it's always a pass 
down thing. You always wear what the people before

11:13.186 --> 11:15.491
you wore. Well, no one had a size 14 foot. No one even 
had clothes. The closest I had was an 11. And so I had

11:21.344 --> 11:25.092
to wear a size 11 shoe for about a month and a half. I 
remember that first Yale practice like my toes

11:25.780 --> 11:30.566
were almost bleeding by the end of that simply 
because we were having to run around so much. Now

11:30.927 --> 11:33.190
these are leather shoes or? It depends on what you 
can find to be honest with you. We've had

11:35.833 --> 11:41.841
everything from leather to suede like this year's 
was more of a suede material I guess. But not canvas

11:42.101 --> 11:43.623
like a sneaker? No, they're not canvas. And what 
socks do you wear? Just regular athletic socks.

11:49.066 --> 11:49.347
White? White. White athletic socks. So the only 
things that aren't white on whatever you're

11:50.951 --> 11:58.690
wearing are the ATM, the brass buckle, and then 
your shoes. When you learned that you had been

11:59.041 --> 12:04.088
elected, how soon before you contacted your 
family? We called them that night. What did you

12:06.031 --> 12:06.532
tell them? Right then. Actually, I wasn't the one 
that called them. Sko, that Roscoe, the guy that I

12:09.336 --> 12:11.419
told you about. My parents aren't very excitable 
people. Just simply because of their nature of

12:14.303 --> 12:18.950
having to do with elections and having defeats and 
all that stuff. They aren't excitable. like they

12:20.152 --> 12:40.219
really aren't they don't yell and scream a lot or 
anything like that and so sco said that he called

12:20.152 --> 12:40.219
him and my dad answered the phone and sco was 
yelling and screaming i mean he was very excited he

12:20.152 --> 12:40.219
was like we won we won we won and my dad was like 
that's great congratulations and then sco just

12:20.152 --> 12:40.219
remembers looking at the phone and being like okay 
well we did so bye and then hung up and then of course

12:20.152 --> 12:40.219
we just were yelling and screaming. So yeah, I 
called them that night. My parents had a lot to do

12:43.388 --> 12:46.612
with that even though they had no idea what was 
going on. Neither of them had any idea what A&M was

12:46.652 --> 12:52.458
about other than that they remember how Yale 
leaders acted at Rice. When did you and the other

12:54.200 --> 12:59.106
Yale leaders have your first event? Parents 
Weekend Yale Practice was the first time that we,

12:59.766 --> 13:04.211
the five of us, had a Yale practice together. Now 
there was other stuff like we had a pie throwing

13:04.272 --> 13:09.177
contest and stuff like that where they wanted a 
Yale leader to be there. But as far as the yell

13:09.697 --> 13:14.542
leaders, the five of us getting together and 
having an event, that was parents weekend. And

13:15.223 --> 13:17.245
when did you practice for that event? I remember 
having a meeting in the core headquarters, there

13:17.586 --> 13:25.754
in the little debriefing room, and we went over the 
yells. It was funny, just because none of us really

13:25.774 --> 13:28.497
knew what we were doing. So Jeff and John, who were 
the two seniors that had been yell leaders before,

13:28.978 --> 13:32.802
kind of knew. what that was just they they had to 
teach us and they had said that looks good that

13:34.064 --> 13:57.405
doesn't that looks good that doesn't so it was all 
right was there a predetermined arrangement of

13:34.064 --> 13:57.405
where the five of you stood um it's always the head 
yellier stands in the middle and then they it's

13:34.064 --> 13:57.405
just kind of the seniors talk about which side they 
want to be on and then they assign the juniors and i

13:34.064 --> 13:57.405
was assigned to be on the far right side for a couple 
reasons one because I wouldn't be in front of any

13:57.841 --> 14:07.092
core guys because they said that they wanted to 
make sure that nothing happened on that simply

13:57.841 --> 14:07.092
because there were core people and are still 
people in the Corps of Cadets that didn't agree

14:07.460 --> 14:10.304
with me being a yell leader. And so they put me on the 
right-hand side, which would just be in front of

14:11.746 --> 14:18.055
students and parents that sit there, for two 
reasons. One, for that, and also just because I was

14:18.155 --> 14:20.678
the tallest yell leader. And so because the one on 
the end is the one that has to call off the, like,

14:21.139 --> 14:27.728
when you're doing it, they're the one that does the 
motion to call off the thing. So everybody needs to

14:27.748 --> 14:30.752
be able to see them. Now, were there any letters in 
the battalion about this? I've got a whole stack of

14:33.953 --> 14:36.438
battalions at home. They were in the mail call, you 
know, the little opinion section of the

14:36.458 --> 14:40.427
battalion. Actually, right after the election, 
the battalion wrote a little thing about me being

14:40.647 --> 14:52.271
elected and how I was a non-corps yell leader and 
all this kind of stuff. And then the next day, so for

14:52.291 --> 14:55.017
about a week and a half, There was just stuff. There 
was just stuff in it. Back and forth. Someone in the

15:00.820 --> 15:03.163
court would write something and someone out of the 
court would write something. It was just back and

15:03.183 --> 15:04.585
forth, back and forth. Anything ever said to you 
going up and down a hallway, going to or from class

15:04.885 --> 15:11.053
or anywhere? Well, some congratulations. I'd get 
a bunch of stares and stuff. But it's funny. People

15:17.401 --> 15:23.689
really didn't, even though they knew that Ricky 
Wood had been elected, they didn't necessarily

15:17.401 --> 15:23.689
know that I was he. Mm-hmm. And you weren't on TV or 
anything like that? Not at that point, no.

15:33.160 --> 15:34.662
So how did the Parents Weekend go? Parents Weekend 
went well. Something that we do that they didn't do

15:36.344 --> 15:42.711
this year, I guess it's done, is that just like in 
the Corps, when you get a position, you get shaved.

15:43.672 --> 15:51.261
I don't know if you've heard that talked about or 
not, but if you get a position, well, for instance,

15:43.672 --> 15:51.261
you get a position when you got elected Yale 
leader, a friend of mine named Baba, he'd be

15:51.882 --> 15:58.173
sitting there, and then all of a sudden his fish 
would run into his room, grab him, pull him into the

15:51.882 --> 15:58.173
showers, and they'd shave him head to toe. 
Including private area. Including private area.

16:01.458 --> 16:02.320
They'd shave everything. Except eyebrows. You'd 
keep the eyebrows and eyelashes. Everything else

16:06.988 --> 16:07.829
is gone. And so we were bald, to say, which was 
really interesting. That did happen. All right,

16:14.601 --> 16:16.624
and the shavers were corps members? For me, no. The 
shavers were my friends. Oh, okay. They just came

16:20.837 --> 16:22.399
and grabbed me one day. And that happened where? 
That happened in my living room, actually. We have

16:27.547 --> 16:28.969
pictures, and it's really funny. As far as you 
know, did anyone encourage them to do that? Yes,

16:33.356 --> 16:34.477
they did. They were encouraged to do so. But it was 
fun. It's one of those things that's just really

16:38.263 --> 16:39.925
neat. I mean, it stinks, and, of course, you itch 
real bad. Yes. But it's one of those things,

16:43.368 --> 16:49.054
especially for the guy who they called my buddy, my 
junior Yale leader buddy. His name is Bubba. It was

16:51.816 --> 16:56.461
one of the first times that we had an issue to which 
we could both talk on. Does that make sense? Even

16:57.482 --> 16:58.583
though there's many now. I mean, we're going to be 
friends for the rest of our lives. But at that

17:00.725 --> 17:04.369
point, we didn't really have anything that we 
could speak on. And this was like the first thing.

17:07.052 --> 17:09.454
And then one of the seniors was shaved as well. And 
so we talked about that. All right, the rest of that

17:13.051 --> 17:19.483
spring, were there any other important 
cheerleader events? Not real important ones. The

17:21.952 --> 17:24.877
big thing that happened that year is we started 
something called First Yell. Now, I don't know if

17:25.537 --> 17:27.360
you know what First Yell is. That was the first 
year. Describe it. First Yell was something that

17:30.184 --> 17:34.931
the Association of Former Yell Leaders came to us 
about and said, you know what? And this was still

17:35.051 --> 17:36.753
when Bonfire was going on. And so they said, you 
know what? Just like Bonfire ends off the football

17:39.157 --> 17:45.906
season, we need something that will kick off the 
football season because generally we play lower

17:39.157 --> 17:45.906
class teams the first game of the year. So we were 
wondering if there's something... that y'all

17:48.370 --> 17:53.234
could put together that would bring people back to 
campus and get that first game sold out. So we just

17:54.916 --> 17:56.317
started thinking. We started having meetings 
with all the key people on campus. We invited the

17:58.599 --> 18:06.106
Vice President of Student Affairs, Athletic 
Department, 12th Man Foundation, Association of

17:58.599 --> 18:06.106
Former Students, people in the community, and 
said, okay, this is our idea. We're going to do it.

18:07.247 --> 18:08.508
And no one thought we could do it. People were just 
saying, okay, the five Yale leaders have no

18:08.988 --> 18:12.351
programming experience. They have no experience 
programming the event. How in the world are y'all

18:14.473 --> 18:16.335
going to get this off? How in the world are y'all 
going to do it? All it was was a decision. All it was

18:19.577 --> 18:20.739
was this, that, and the other. And so really, two 
weeks after I got elected, that became a huge focus

18:21.279 --> 18:25.504
of what we did. And so that summer, we just worked on 
First Yell. And First Yell consisted of a Friday

18:30.410 --> 18:39.521
afternoon, fun time for students, Friday night 
entertainment, Saturday morning barbecue, and

18:30.410 --> 18:39.521
then Saturday night game. Oh, and midnight yell 
practice, obviously, on Friday night. And that

18:42.016 --> 18:44.760
week was absolutely horrendous. Probably one of 
the harder four days or week long just because

18:45.902 --> 18:52.693
starting that Monday, we were getting all the 
final preparations done. And then starting that

18:52.733 --> 18:57.981
Thursday night or that Friday morning, I remember 
getting out to R. Simpson Drill Field about 4.30 in

18:52.733 --> 18:57.981
the morning. And I didn't leave R. Simpson until 
about 9.30 at night. And that was just to go put my

19:02.007 --> 19:04.371
overalls on to go to Yale practice. And then after 
Yale practice, I went home and slept for three

19:05.152 --> 19:10.200
hours and then woke up and came back out to the 
barbecue and then had to go to a football game. It

19:10.940 --> 19:14.487
was a very, very hard day, but it was great. All 
right, now back in the spring, did class

19:14.703 --> 19:22.052
attendance and grades suffer from? Actually, I 
had to Q-drop a class because of campaigning. I

19:25.457 --> 19:28.821
made the lowest grade I've ever made on a test 
because of campaigning. I got a B in that class

19:29.502 --> 19:33.146
instead of an A that I should have gotten because of 
that one test. I had an 89.3 in that class because I

19:33.166 --> 19:43.039
made a 54 on the third test, which fell right in the 
middle of campaigning, and I walked into that

19:33.166 --> 19:43.039
class having not opened a book and took the test. 
But I did Q-drop another class during that time

19:43.019 --> 19:48.097
just because I didn't. Did any faculty, any of your 
instructors in any way acknowledge your new task?

19:55.895 --> 19:56.856
Yes, they did. In the spring, a couple of people 
said congratulations. But then in the fall is

20:00.800 --> 20:03.742
really when people started acknowledging. It 
just simply because we missed class so much. What

20:07.346 --> 20:09.468
did you then do that summer? That summer, Aggie 
Moms Clubs is essentially what our job is. Our job,

20:13.071 --> 20:16.655
not only are we obviously at athletic events, but 
we also go and speak everywhere. We go speak all

20:17.215 --> 20:19.357
over the state. So you didn't have a job that 
summer? No, gosh, no. Actually, I start work. 26

20:25.072 --> 20:39.418
days and this is the first time that I've held a job 
since fall of my sophomore year and I can't wait I'm

20:25.072 --> 20:39.418
sick of being poor the now by this time had you any 
romantic life? Did you have a girlfriend by this

20:41.334 --> 20:42.596
time? Actually I did I started dating a girl in 
March of my sophomore year and so she we started

20:42.616 --> 21:08.292
dating and then campaigning started and then I got 
elected and then we kept on and we broke up in last

20:42.616 --> 21:08.292
February like February a year ago but then we got 
back together this November and so we're back

20:42.616 --> 21:08.292
together now And actually, she just dropped me 
off. She just dropped me off. And how did the Yale

21:12.722 --> 21:18.589
Leader activities affect romance? It was really 
good and it was really bad. It was good in that I got

21:20.572 --> 21:29.202
to take the girl that I liked, obviously, and my 
girlfriend to do stuff that no other guy could take

21:20.572 --> 21:29.202
her to go do. No other guy on this campus could take 
Kate, my girlfriend, I think, could take Kate to do

21:30.564 --> 21:39.274
the things, to go walk on the field with the torches 
at Yale practice, to go to these games, to go on the

21:30.564 --> 21:39.274
away games. to go and go to Dr. Sutherland's house, 
be on first-name basis with Dr. Bowen. There's

21:44.163 --> 21:51.015
just certain things that you get and you can give to 
your friends that you wouldn't get otherwise. It

21:51.816 --> 21:53.860
was really hard just because I was so busy. What it 
really did is it affected my other friendships

21:53.900 --> 22:03.777
just because I had Yell Leader, which was a 
24-hour-a-day job, and then I had a girlfriend.

22:04.027 --> 22:07.412
which I really wanted to invest time in, and so 
something had to give. And so it was really kind of

22:08.373 --> 22:17.226
my same-sex friendships, my guy friendships that 
gave on that a lot, which was tough, but it's

22:08.373 --> 22:17.226
picking back up, so that's good. But I guess that's 
just one of the things that you have to give up. All

22:19.970 --> 22:23.175
right, then junior year begins that fall. 
Describe the routine for a typical home game. And

22:31.381 --> 22:35.509
then an out-of-the-way, I mean out-of-town trip. 
Okay. Home game, Friday morning you wake up, and

22:36.471 --> 22:41.661
it's just a different day. You can tell it is. You go 
to your classes. You do whatever. One of the

22:44.106 --> 22:51.060
responsibilities of a junior yell leader is you 
call the seniors every morning and tell them

22:44.106 --> 22:51.060
what's on the schedule. That's just what you did. 
You called them. If they had to wake up at a certain

22:53.646 --> 22:55.708
time, you make sure they're awake. You said we had 
this at this at this at this, and this is what you

22:56.669 --> 23:04.178
needed to wear, and the uniform will be here to pick 
it up or take it by their room. Now, there were two

23:04.859 --> 23:06.821
juniors. Two juniors and three seniors. Okay, and 
did you call each of the three? We split up the days

23:10.725 --> 23:11.887
of the week. We split up the days of the week. So, 
yeah, we split up the days of the week. Normally you

23:17.393 --> 23:19.175
made the phone call about what time? 7 o'clock in 
the morning. I'd wake up, call them, go back to

23:21.382 --> 23:24.526
sleep. Just because they were obviously already 
awake because of formation and whatnot. Okay, so

23:27.911 --> 23:29.233
keep going. And so you'd call them, and then you'd 
just go about normal day, and then about 5 o'clock,

23:29.393 --> 23:37.363
usually everyone would go out to eat. Sometimes 
we'd go together, sometimes we wouldn't. But then

23:40.848 --> 23:47.457
I'd go back to my room, and I would just put my 
overalls on, and then we'd meet behind Duncan at 11

23:40.848 --> 23:47.457
o'clock. p.m. Friday night. Friday night. And 
then we would have our torches and we'd walk over

23:51.750 --> 23:56.715
and do midnight yell practice that would last 
until about 1 or 1.30. And it would just be, I mean,

23:57.175 --> 24:00.378
it's, that's, there's nothing like that. There's 
absolutely nothing like midnight yell practice

24:00.538 --> 24:03.120
down on the track. How did you feel that first? The 
first one of the year, I remember, I remember I

24:05.362 --> 24:10.006
didn't get to enjoy it that much because of first 
yell. That was first yell weekend. And you know

24:11.147 --> 24:16.072
about the, I don't know if you've heard about the 
push-ups that junior, that yell leaders do, the

24:11.147 --> 24:16.072
junior yell leaders. That was a big... big area of 
concern simply because I, not being in the core, I

24:18.267 --> 24:22.995
wasn't used to doing push-ups all the time. Sure, I 
was an athlete, and so I could do, I could sit down

24:23.015 --> 24:32.550
and I could do 100 push-ups, but that's not near the 
amount that we would do on the 50-yard line in Kyle

24:23.015 --> 24:32.550
Field. I mean, it was just... intense intense 
physical activity and so that was always a point of

24:34.687 --> 25:03.867
I guess not fear necessarily but just nervousness 
okay am I going to be able to do it how tired am I going

24:34.687 --> 25:03.867
to get am I going to be able to lift my arms 
afterwards because then you do all those pushups

24:34.687 --> 25:03.867
and so your arms are completely dead and then you 
start doing yells and that's just a bunch of

24:34.687 --> 25:03.867
raising your hands and stuff and so very tired I 
remember after the first yell practice there in

24:34.687 --> 25:03.867
the fall but I remember it was just 30,000 people 
were there Just amazing. Amazing. At what point

25:08.376 --> 25:11.540
then, it's called a fable, isn't it? At what point 
did a new junior yell eater get to tell a fable? Was

25:16.046 --> 25:17.487
it the first midnight yell practice? Oh, really? 
Mm-hmm. First midnight yell practice. Did you

25:21.592 --> 25:25.877
ever tell any that in hindsight you thought maybe 
you shouldn't have? No. Actually, we did really

25:26.538 --> 25:33.887
good at just telling, making sure to tell the good 
ones just because... We're really trying to, I

25:35.150 --> 25:41.086
know that we're making a concerted effort to make 
Yale Leader into a position that wasn't looked

25:35.150 --> 25:41.086
like it was 10 years ago. We want Yale Leader to be 
equal to a student body president. Just as far as

25:46.701 --> 25:48.606
stature and just as far as respect. Because that's 
what we feel, I mean, The position calls for it, and

25:52.430 --> 25:55.996
so why not live up to it, if that makes any sense? And 
so we were really careful. We always talked about

25:57.979 --> 26:00.222
which fables we were going to tell. Now, there are 
certain ones that you would tell. Like, for

26:02.586 --> 26:06.332
instance, okay, so we do the midnight yell 
practice, and we wake up early on Saturday. We make

26:06.953 --> 26:11.159
sure the uniform is all done, and then I'll get back 
to the fable in a second. And then the other junior

26:11.180 --> 26:16.588
yell leader and myself, we'd walk over to Kyle 
Field about an hour and a half before game time. We

26:18.311 --> 26:19.753
go down in the locker room. put the seniors 
uniforms there because the seniors would march

26:20.527 --> 26:23.572
with their core. They'd march in with their core. 
And so we'd be standing down there right by like the

26:25.937 --> 26:32.428
viewing stand where all the honored guests always 
are. And so, I mean, we got to meet some really,

26:32.528 --> 26:35.674
really neat people down there. Colin Powell, the 
president, former and current George Bush, Rick

26:36.375 --> 26:41.644
Perry. I've actually, Rick Perry and I have 
actually grown to be on a first name basis which has

26:44.523 --> 27:07.341
been really really neat just simply because he's a 
governor former head yell leader so that was

26:44.523 --> 27:07.341
really neat then the seniors marched by then we'd 
run down to the locker room they'd get dressed and

26:44.523 --> 27:07.341
then men running out onto that field from 
underneath and running across the field and

26:44.523 --> 27:07.341
seeing the student section and getting them to 
stand up and do yells it's It is definitely

27:08.620 --> 27:14.932
something that I don't think I'll ever experience 
anything like it again in the rest of my entire

27:08.620 --> 27:14.932
life. Then when the game was over, a night game 
over, what did you and the other Yale leaders

27:15.514 --> 27:23.088
normally do after the game? Well, if we won, they 
would obviously, the freshman in the corps would

27:23.449 --> 27:28.519
run out and tackle us. pick us up and carry us over to 
Fish Pond on the north side in front of Sabisa,

27:28.702 --> 27:37.130
throw us in, we do a couple yells and then we walk 
over the steps of the YMCA building and have a full

27:28.702 --> 27:37.130
yell practice there. And that was always fun 
simply because we just got to mess with whoever.

27:41.214 --> 27:46.719
Those were always more fun yell practices just 
because you could just say anything, which was

27:41.214 --> 27:46.719
really neat. Some of my fondest memories and then 
obviously we'd stay after because people would

27:48.341 --> 27:56.008
want pictures and we'd stand around and talk and 
then we'd make plans for whatever we're going to do

27:48.341 --> 27:56.008
that night. Whatever it be, whether we go out to 
dinner, whether we go to a party, whether we just go

27:56.782 --> 28:03.851
hang out in someone's dorm room, whose parents 
were in town if we wanted to do that. So it was always

28:04.532 --> 28:08.758
just kind of a... And what time would all that 
activity end? Oh. It depended on when the game was

28:11.161 --> 28:13.104
and all that kind of stuff. No, make believe it's a 
night game, 7.30 game. 7.30 game. We would get done

28:16.749 --> 28:20.073
with that about 10.30, so we wouldn't be ready to go 
out until 11, 11.15. All right, and then what? That

28:23.858 --> 28:26.181
night we'd go to a party and... It depended on where 
it was. I mean, like, if we went, like, this year,

28:27.685 --> 28:35.295
for instance, went to some tailgate parties with 
the Association for Memorial Leaders, those

28:27.685 --> 28:35.295
wouldn't get done until 4, 4 in the morning. So 
almost all night. Oh, yeah. Oh, sure. Oh, sure.

28:40.041 --> 28:40.802
They'd go a long time. My junior year was a little 
different simply because, just like in the Corps

28:40.822 --> 28:45.289
Cadets, there's a class system. We wouldn't 
really hang out with the seniors necessarily. But

28:50.335 --> 28:52.599
we would a little bit every once in a while. But this 
year was very different. I mean, this year... At

28:55.810 --> 29:04.411
that junior year, how long was it before you began 
to feel that all Leo leaders were a group?

29:05.193 --> 29:05.915
Beginning of the fall. That's when it started. 
They accepted you. I put it this way to a lot of

29:09.428 --> 29:11.811
people. They're like, well, how is it? I was like, 
well, it's a little odd right now. And they're

29:14.094 --> 29:14.795
like, still? I mean, that's weird. It's been six 
weeks, you know? And I was like, well, think about

29:17.158 --> 29:18.299
it this way. Think about you having five best 
friends, and all of a sudden, just on one night in 15

29:18.740 --> 29:27.010
minutes, one of them is taken out and someone else 
is pushed in its place. That's hard to deal with,

29:29.353 --> 29:30.574
you know? I haven't totally accepted them. They 
haven't totally accepted me. And so it really

29:33.948 --> 29:43.490
wasn't until we started having common 
experiences that we could draw from, that we could

29:33.948 --> 29:43.490
talk about, that I wasn't listening to their 
stories and they weren't listening to my stories.

29:43.611 --> 29:44.533
We were telling stories. That's when it became... 
We became, friendships were starting to form and

29:46.840 --> 29:48.984
stuff. Was the first out-of-town game a 
significant memory? That was actually the first

29:53.673 --> 29:55.376
game of the year that year. It was versus Louisiana 
Tech in Shreveport, Louisiana. And that really

29:58.021 --> 30:02.009
was, because I told the fable that night, and I 
remember being so nervous. We were walking, and it

30:02.309 --> 30:06.958
was right before y'all practiced, and there was a 
lot of people there, and I remember... walking

30:07.681 --> 30:12.948
with my girlfriend Kate and I was like well this is 
the fable I'm going to tell and she was like that's

30:07.681 --> 30:12.948
stupid I was like what? and I told her the fable and 
she was like that's dumb and I was like then what am I

30:12.968 --> 30:15.652
going to do? I started freaking out and not knowing 
what I was going to say ended up telling it and it was

30:16.032 --> 30:25.104
fine but it was I remember that was a you went in your 
own vehicle? no actually travel is provided for us

30:26.005 --> 30:35.478
we flew we flew to every game all the just the Yacht 
Leaders just the five Yacht Leaders and who

30:26.005 --> 30:35.478
provided the plane? American Airlines We have a 
budget, Yale leaders have a budget that is set

30:39.119 --> 30:49.955
aside from the association of former students and 
the university gives us money. So this was a small

30:50.316 --> 30:52.659
charter plane? No, it wasn't a charter plane. It 
was just, it was American Airlines. Oh, so here to

30:55.624 --> 30:59.610
Dallas and then to Cleveland? Yeah, we flew 
commercial. Well, did anyone go with, when the

31:01.124 --> 31:07.294
Yale leaders go like that, does anyone go with the 
Yale leaders? My junior year, no, not as much. My

31:09.878 --> 31:12.962
junior year, two games a year, Rusty Thompson, who 
was our advisor, would come with us. This year,

31:13.924 --> 31:17.810
every game, Rusty came with us, just simply 
because of the more risk management. Now, what

31:17.890 --> 31:19.813
does identify Rusty? Rusty Thompson, he's the 
associate director of the MSC, and he was advisor

31:19.833 --> 31:27.705
for the Yale leaders at Bonfire. That was his dual 
role. And was he experienced in that role?
