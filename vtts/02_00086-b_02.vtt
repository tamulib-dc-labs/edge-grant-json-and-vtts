WEBVTT

00:03.743 --> 00:14.454
You know, probably John Pearson termination was partially he took a side and his side lost.

00:14.474 --> 00:23.042
So, you know, those were not good times internal politically.

00:23.483 --> 00:24.383
But we grew out of that.

00:25.044 --> 00:25.845
We grew out of that.

00:25.945 --> 00:29.008
And the college, and maybe John leaving,

00:29.292 --> 00:42.891
at that time was just the time for John to leave anyway, because Muse came in, and then Mobley came in, and Benton has come in, and Don Hellriegel has been underpinning on this, and our college, I think we've got a great college.

00:46.335 --> 00:55.688
When did y'all begin to feel that business was being treated with the same kind of favoritism that agriculture and engineering supposedly had had all through the years?

00:55.718 --> 00:58.188
Well, I think it began with Muse at some place.

00:59.634 --> 01:03.229
Not at the beginning with Muse, but towards, and then particularly with Mobley.

01:03.731 --> 01:06.201
And the advisory committees do a lot of this.

01:06.367 --> 01:10.693
The advisory committees began to make statements and say things.

01:11.495 --> 01:14.980
And then, of course, Benton has been so good here.

01:15.020 --> 01:20.067
Benton has a countenance about him and a demeanor.

01:20.889 --> 01:26.176
Was there a time when you all began to think, okay, we have now entered the big league?

01:26.217 --> 01:28.560
Was there something that happened nationally?

01:29.097 --> 01:29.397
No.

01:29.978 --> 01:30.358
Uh-uh.

01:30.418 --> 01:31.700
No.

01:31.760 --> 01:32.641
We just chipped away.

01:33.321 --> 01:34.182
We just chipped away.

01:34.723 --> 01:48.276
When you begin to get visibility of certain programs, maybe a step for us, particularly our department, is when we hired Lynn Berry.

01:48.877 --> 01:56.404
Dan Robertson took over in 81 or 82 I think as department head behind me.

01:56.941 --> 02:09.874
I think Chuck Lamb or Bill Pride kind of did interim work or were department head, and then Dan Robertson came, and then Dan hired Lynn Berry, and Lynn Berry came in and began this Center for Retail Studies.

02:10.815 --> 02:12.817
He's got a first-class operation over there.

02:12.837 --> 02:13.838
Now, he stepped down.

02:13.858 --> 02:24.349
It's going to be interesting to see what happens with him stepping down, but Lynn gave this college and this department a lot of visibility as a result of that.

02:24.329 --> 02:25.050
All right.

02:25.070 --> 02:27.493
You go back to the department.

02:28.054 --> 02:29.516
You ceased being department head when?

02:29.957 --> 02:31.058
Oh, about 79 or 80.

02:31.178 --> 02:34.022
I had one four-year.

02:34.303 --> 02:34.623
Okay.

02:35.484 --> 02:38.148
And you started... Go ahead.

02:38.749 --> 02:42.854
And I was going to say, what were your key courses then when you go back to the department?

02:42.914 --> 02:48.582
Oh, I ran the undergraduate program from 80 to 90.

02:48.562 --> 02:49.984
For the Department of Marketing?

02:50.004 --> 02:50.965
For the College of Business.

02:51.005 --> 02:51.826
Oh, the College of Business.

02:52.167 --> 02:53.689
Yeah, I ran the undergraduate program.

02:53.709 --> 02:54.530
Oh, describe that.

02:54.850 --> 02:56.392
Well, that was a challenge.

02:57.674 --> 03:00.537
If I would say my contribution was that.

03:00.858 --> 03:01.599
What was the title?

03:02.400 --> 03:03.221
I was assistant dean.

03:03.441 --> 03:05.063
You were assistant dean for?

03:05.103 --> 03:11.451
Assistant dean, and I kind of bucked politically for associate, but Mews would never, and now today it would be associate dean.

03:11.511 --> 03:18.180
But then Bill wanted one associate, and Dan Robertson was assistant, ran the MBA.

03:18.734 --> 03:21.416
I was assistant, and I ran the undergraduate.

03:21.617 --> 03:24.619
And we reported to Bill Mobley, and Mobley then reported John.

03:24.639 --> 03:27.101
It was pretty thin, pretty thin operation.

03:27.402 --> 03:30.584
Describe the duties of that assistant dean then.

03:30.605 --> 03:31.886
Well, my job was to run it.

03:31.966 --> 03:48.100
So the first thing that I did, having come from what I thought was a great school, University of Illinois, and having for two years helped run as assistant dean, run the undergraduate programs for the College of Commerce there, I had a pretty good idea of what we wanted to do.

03:48.687 --> 04:00.364
So I came in as assistant dean and began to say we're going to get rid of some dead weight.

04:01.165 --> 04:05.272
I thought we were keeping too many undergraduate students here.

04:06.133 --> 04:14.425
So formed an undergraduate committee and we began to work on the academic program for the College of Business.

04:14.945 --> 04:22.945
Bill Mewes and myself and others, we traveled around, there were four or five of us, traveled around the United States looking at other undergraduate programs.

04:24.048 --> 04:28.178
Bill Mewes wanted to ratchet this thing up.

04:29.086 --> 04:35.793
And we went to Illinois, back to Illinois, went to Michigan State, went to Indiana, went to a variety of places.

04:35.833 --> 04:38.575
And while we were there, we were trying to do some recruiting along the way.

04:38.635 --> 04:43.780
But basically, look at their graduate programs, their undergraduate programs, and I looked at their undergraduate programs.

04:45.001 --> 04:56.933
And so that's, we came back and we began to put this thing called the Common Body of Knowledge, where we put a set of courses together and said, you've got to take these courses and you've got to do so well.

04:58.516 --> 05:06.130
I was also on the AOC, the academic deans thing for the assistant deans for rules and regs and I was a

05:06.953 --> 05:16.586
I was a bear in there because I looked at the rules and regs and I just thought some of them were poorly worded, some of them weren't good, and I can still remember.

05:16.606 --> 05:20.831
And at that time there was, who was registrar?

05:21.773 --> 05:23.234
Ed Cooper.

05:23.575 --> 05:24.056
Ed Cooper.

05:24.356 --> 05:33.568
Couldn't understand how Ed Cooper could be head of the academics for rules and regulation

05:33.970 --> 05:47.871
and had to work a dean when he didn't even have a degree, you know, had to have a PhD, and so that was short-lived, and I think eventually that got, and McCandless came in under Calhoun or somebody and began running, but go back to there.

05:48.251 --> 06:00.670
It was a struggle to try to get those other assistant deans to ratchet up, and I began to wiggle around and tweak some of the rules and regs so that I got a rule that said,

06:01.730 --> 06:09.992
that it was, and Dan Falklust from Geosciences was on there, and Dan and I kind of shared the same idea about trying to ratchet the standard.

06:12.118 --> 06:16.650
A fellow from history, Garland, I think was, Garland was over there.

06:17.018 --> 06:45.490
as you know he's a little bit more liberal and he was a little more more tender-hearted and I wasn't quite that tender-hearted and and so we were always at odds about where the ratchet ought to be but one rule was and we got changed because we wanted the option a any college any a student any college you know a student who whose grade point

06:46.432 --> 07:04.373
falls below a 2.0 in any semester may be put on probation by the dean of that college may so that meant there were only two colleges that did that geosciences and business and so what we began to do

07:04.690 --> 07:06.052
Because that's what we did at Illinois.

07:06.212 --> 07:09.978
Doesn't matter what your grade point is, you are on trial every semester.

07:10.779 --> 07:16.869
And so, man, we'd have a thousand kids, you know, freshmen come in, we'd have a thousand kids on probation at the end.

07:16.889 --> 07:17.850
But we had their attention.

07:18.972 --> 07:21.736
And two semesters in a row, you're dead meat.

07:21.776 --> 07:22.197
You're gone.

07:23.599 --> 07:32.352
And so everybody was heading over to Suter's job over to Ag, or everybody was running the general studies.

07:32.416 --> 07:37.342
or everybody was running the liberal arts that we were getting rid of.

07:37.602 --> 07:41.867
And of course those people were saying, you're sending us the bottom end.

07:42.848 --> 07:45.011
Well no, I'm not sending you, you don't have to take them.

07:46.152 --> 07:47.774
But they wanted to take them.

07:50.357 --> 07:57.346
So we began to play very, very, very hard-nosed academic performance.

07:57.987 --> 07:59.208
And that was tough.

07:59.308 --> 08:01.731
Took a lot of heat, a lot of stress from that.

08:02.318 --> 08:03.719
But we ratcheted up the program.

08:04.320 --> 08:07.023
In hindsight, you believe that was a good?

08:07.043 --> 08:08.144
Oh, I know it is.

08:08.304 --> 08:12.989
And we have, one of my disappointments is that we've moved off from that.

08:16.813 --> 08:26.404
And, you know, there are, I have some feelings about how we run those academic programs, but that's, you know, that's just my opinion because of somebody else, and I'm not the dean.

08:26.704 --> 08:29.727
And we, you know, we would take everything to the faculty.

08:30.365 --> 08:35.311
The executive committee would approve of it if the faculty would approve.

08:35.331 --> 08:38.454
And we would take it to the faculty and, of course, the faculty didn't really care.

08:38.474 --> 08:39.996
They wanted somebody else to run the program.

08:40.036 --> 08:44.101
And we just were sending them better kids all the time, getting them better kids.

08:44.121 --> 08:50.649
And so when I stepped down, those things went away.

08:50.909 --> 08:54.313
And part of it was is that the undergraduate programs office,

08:55.205 --> 09:03.235
I mean we had to, we spent more and more money putting money into advisors and money into counselors because we were putting so many kids on probation.

09:05.058 --> 09:20.117
And during that decade then, were you the person that was almost the counselor of last resort for the student who could come and ask for an exception, please allow me to stay another semester?

09:20.138 --> 09:21.619
Well it didn't quite go that way.

09:21.800 --> 09:25.144
I would, I would, I knew why they were there.

09:25.748 --> 09:31.675
And I would say, please tell me why I should treat you differently than the others.

09:31.876 --> 09:33.097
But you did hear it.

09:33.117 --> 09:33.818
Oh, you heard them.

09:34.359 --> 09:37.342
And I would say probably one out of ten.

09:38.464 --> 09:47.655
Give this machine some examples of some exceptions you made that in hindsight you're glad you made.

09:47.821 --> 09:54.929
Oh, I have one guy that for a semester had zero grade points on two semesters.

09:54.969 --> 09:55.650
No, zero semesters.

09:56.170 --> 09:58.092
And he had set out his two years and he came back.

09:58.253 --> 10:03.699
And he had been on drugs.

10:06.342 --> 10:10.566
And came back, admitted it, and he made four points the rest of the time he came back.

10:12.989 --> 10:13.930
Had a paraplegic.

10:16.441 --> 10:21.587
And he wanted to drop courses.

10:22.367 --> 10:23.989
And I said, you signed up for those courses.

10:24.450 --> 10:25.351
You take those courses.

10:26.492 --> 10:29.495
Made a 4-0 that semester apparently in a wheelchair.

10:29.575 --> 10:31.577
And he was a senior in accounting.

10:31.598 --> 10:32.478
I said, you've been here.

10:32.759 --> 10:33.920
He says, well I can't get around.

10:33.940 --> 10:34.921
I said, don't give me that.

10:36.002 --> 10:37.444
You've been here for four years.

10:38.125 --> 10:39.887
You know how to get around.

10:39.907 --> 10:41.668
You sit down and figure out your schedule.

10:41.969 --> 10:43.090
Now you go out and do it.

10:43.525 --> 10:49.191
And I guess he did it to show me because I got a 4.0 out of it.

10:49.211 --> 10:51.734
And there's others that I think I did the right thing.

10:53.656 --> 10:55.418
Part of this is trying to teach a lesson.

10:55.618 --> 10:55.838
Sure.

10:57.280 --> 11:09.853
A kid came in who didn't do well, put him on probation, and he came in the office to talk to me, and the reason he was on probation, his father

11:11.318 --> 11:37.900
uh was ill with cancer i said why are you in school you yeah if this is what got you in this particular you don't need to be in school oh yes i need to be in school so he stayed in school his father died and he flunked out and he came to get back in and i said wait a minute i thought we had this conversation a semester ago yeah but i thought i could make it well you didn't did you yeah but my dad died yes we knew your dad would die

11:39.145 --> 11:41.730
And I terminated him.

11:42.251 --> 11:44.375
Now that sounds cruel, and it probably is.

11:45.397 --> 11:53.092
I was raised by a tough love dad in a tough love family, and I raised my kids tough love.

11:53.112 --> 11:55.737
And that may not be the right style, but that's my style.

11:55.868 --> 12:05.539
All right, do you remember any time when a minority student or a female asked for any special?

12:05.660 --> 12:08.103
Oh, yeah, but you couldn't, you can't, you don't do that.

12:08.283 --> 12:09.344
What were some of their arguments?

12:09.945 --> 12:19.436
Well, none of them, well, there might have been one or two that argued because of being their race, being black.

12:19.756 --> 12:25.403
But you just, you never took it, you never got it to that.

12:25.383 --> 12:27.946
Did any female?

12:28.987 --> 12:37.435
Females haven't, but the minority students have said that what I'm doing is racist.

12:37.715 --> 12:41.419
What about, did anybody try to intervene?

12:43.161 --> 12:44.002
From the administration?

12:44.422 --> 12:46.184
Or former students?

12:46.304 --> 12:46.584
Oh, no.

12:46.644 --> 12:48.326
Oh yeah, oh yeah, you have former students.

12:48.747 --> 12:55.153
But you know, this happened, a lot of this happened under Mobley.

12:55.994 --> 13:03.103
and they would call Mobley and this is why I liked Bill.

13:03.123 --> 13:18.103
Bill would and he would and I think he enjoyed taking this course not enjoyed giving it but enjoyed taking it he said Mr. or Mrs. so-and-so or so the College of Business has faculty

13:18.083 --> 13:47.230
that's why we took it to the faculty and the faculty the College of Business faculty have voted and supported this program and we understand that the uh what you're asking but we must treat everyone alike and sometimes we do things that other people don't particularly care for us to do but I hope you understand our position and he he was there to support

13:47.210 --> 14:02.569
at no time absolutely no time did he say you need to reevaluate this and if we had a situation where a parent wanted to come in and argue it

14:03.258 --> 14:08.766
I would come in, and he would come in, and he'd have his paddle down, and everything that student said, he would write it down.

14:09.788 --> 14:10.388
Who is this?

14:10.408 --> 14:11.430
Bill Mobley.

14:11.690 --> 14:15.836
To show that he was interested in this student, that he was writing their things.

14:15.856 --> 14:23.428
Then he would ask the people to leave, we would talk, and they would come out, and of course we knew what the answer would be.

14:23.928 --> 14:27.814
Keep in mind, in the rules and regulations, there's always an appeal.

14:28.300 --> 14:40.836
And, again, Linda and Bill go to our church, sit with you Sunday ago, you know.

14:41.777 --> 14:44.120
Math, you know, he was a... Oh, Perry.

14:44.140 --> 14:45.362
Yeah, Linda Perry.

14:46.924 --> 14:52.070
Bill Perry was chairman of the Appeals Committee.

14:53.953 --> 14:57.177
And I came in extremely prepared.

14:57.612 --> 15:16.633
because we had a file on the student we had our letters we sent and you can ask Bill that I was probably one of the most prepared people and I don't I may have all out of 30 or 40 appeals lost one or two and I argued vehemently

15:18.301 --> 15:29.076
I remember one time we had a guy from our department, from our college, because each college has an option on that appeals panel, I guess.

15:29.096 --> 15:40.092
So I went on there, and we send the information ahead to each of the members of that appeals panel, and he says, man, this is cut and dried, Sam.

15:40.593 --> 15:41.054
Cut and dried.

15:41.074 --> 15:42.556
There's no way this kid's going to make it.

15:42.696 --> 15:44.899
I went in and appealed, and I'll be damned if I lost.

15:46.448 --> 15:56.627
and uh uh this guy he said well we just felt sorry for the guy I said sorry you you know and I ran all over him but uh

15:56.877 --> 16:19.358
I don't think I lost very many of those because we had we clearly had a process by which we attempted to notify the student give an opportunity to the student to to improve themselves report to us and if they didn't they didn't clearly there were exceptions and we we before we ever dropped any student

16:19.878 --> 16:26.926
We had a whole, it would have boxes of those who dropped, and we'd go through student by student by student.

16:28.487 --> 16:32.852
The other, my coworker, myself, and we'd say, is there any reason?

16:33.072 --> 16:34.494
Are there any reasons?

16:34.814 --> 16:39.860
And one of the people that we had, Lynn Zimmerman, Lynn was very, very pro-student.

16:39.880 --> 16:44.805
And so I would get Lynn in there and said, are there any of these students that we need to drop?

16:46.726 --> 16:51.892
And he would pull one out and he said, well, let's talk about it.

16:51.912 --> 16:53.414
Sometimes I would and sometimes I wouldn't.

16:53.554 --> 17:05.167
But every student just didn't get, they got a form letter, but they didn't get the form letter without having been looked at very, very closely.

17:05.687 --> 17:10.573
What were the other important responsibilities of the assistant dean?

17:11.853 --> 17:19.507
Well, ours, I don't know, we were just in charge of, you know, the academic programs.

17:19.588 --> 17:23.595
Did you, did you look at what courses were being offered at what hours, what semester?

17:23.615 --> 17:25.519
No, no, no, that was departmental level.

17:25.539 --> 17:31.971
Now I might give feedback that we need to the deans or to the department heads, because I went, I was at the EC,

17:31.951 --> 17:37.277
And I may talk about feedback I get from the kids and send that on up to the department head.

17:37.297 --> 17:40.721
Did you sometimes say to the departments, we need some more sections of this or that?

17:40.961 --> 17:41.822
We will need it.

17:41.862 --> 17:48.590
We can't, you know, maybe next year try to give them some input to it.

17:48.970 --> 17:55.698
And, you know, along about that time in the mid-80s is when we began to put this electronically in.

17:55.798 --> 17:57.300
I sat on that committee with

17:57.280 --> 17:59.782
Carter and Cole.

17:59.943 --> 18:01.144
Don Carter, Brian Cole.

18:01.404 --> 18:11.193
Brian Cole and Don Gardner and William, Steve Williams, and we began to put together that SIMS program.

18:12.334 --> 18:13.015
We did that.

18:13.075 --> 18:24.666
That was a major thing that we did and that took a long time and that was a big, that was a big job and I feel, I feel good about it.

18:24.686 --> 18:27.068
I was on the, when we put in the

18:27.402 --> 18:31.725
core curriculum I was on that committee and that was a real

18:32.009 --> 18:41.522
That was a real contest between those who wanted lighter requirements and those who didn't.

18:41.542 --> 18:43.605
You're talking about the campus core curriculum?

18:43.625 --> 18:45.087
The university core curriculum.

18:45.868 --> 18:57.645
We initially, you know, said you got to have a year of the hard sciences and that went for a while and then after a while the Faculty Senate changed it.

18:57.945 --> 18:59.788
Faculty Senate, by the way, you know, became

18:59.768 --> 19:03.760
more active and vocal on that.

19:05.625 --> 19:11.382
I served on the Faculty Center for six years and on the Executive Committee for two years.

19:12.087 --> 19:23.018
there and again you had this contest between those who wanted to give the students more and those who wanted to tighten up for example the Q drop period.

19:24.520 --> 19:27.543
The Q drop period is now out about 50 class days.

19:29.405 --> 19:35.451
I think too long and so it used to be in the 30 or 40 days, 30 days.

19:36.032 --> 19:38.955
At Illinois it was after the fifth class day.

19:40.353 --> 19:41.395
You couldn't drop it.

19:41.415 --> 19:43.078
I mean, you bought the ranch.

19:44.702 --> 19:45.283
What should it be?

19:47.247 --> 19:50.674
I don't believe in Q-drops.

19:51.495 --> 19:52.277
I really don't.

19:52.998 --> 19:57.467
I think there is enough information out there

19:58.747 --> 20:04.873
enough information out there for you not to get blindsided on the class.

20:05.353 --> 20:08.096
I used to think about, say, two weeks at the most.

20:08.216 --> 20:14.001
Yeah, two weeks at the most because, and that's, you can't add, you're just going to drop.

20:14.582 --> 20:26.813
And what we have, if you aren't careful, and this is what we had before we put in the QDROP, you'd have sign up for six and pick the past four.

20:27.046 --> 20:32.292
And so we had a 20, it was really sign up for the five and pick the best four.

20:32.512 --> 20:37.197
So you had a 20% enrollment piece in there.

20:37.217 --> 20:41.382
And so it became that we weren't utilizing the space well.

20:42.283 --> 20:48.891
I just think the students, I really think the students are treated too liberally.

20:49.792 --> 20:56.479
During this period, do you remember any, during your dean day, your assistant dean days, do you remember any,

20:56.780 --> 20:59.666
Politician, trying to pull a string.

21:00.167 --> 21:06.501
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, and you know I would, I, that wasn't my call.

21:08.846 --> 21:13.236
That was, my response was if the Dean wants that student in,

21:13.790 --> 21:14.491
He gets in.

21:14.752 --> 21:17.658
If the president wants that student in, I let the dean know.

21:18.660 --> 21:20.443
I get paid by the dean.

21:20.463 --> 21:26.415
Did you sometimes get some calls directly to you that should have gone to the dean about some of these matters?

21:28.680 --> 21:31.225
There would be a few, a rep.

21:31.205 --> 21:32.167
A state rep.

21:32.187 --> 21:33.208
A state rep would call.

21:33.268 --> 21:35.452
It wouldn't get any higher than that, but a state rep.

21:35.712 --> 21:39.839
This was... For Joe Johnny, so and so.

21:40.439 --> 21:41.201
From his district.

21:41.241 --> 21:42.002
Such a nice guy.

21:42.042 --> 21:43.264
I've known his mom and dad.

21:44.125 --> 21:51.036
And I would tell him very frankly that the student, I cannot let the student, however,

21:51.016 --> 22:09.835
if the president wants that student in they're fine and of course the president want didn't want to take on that burden he got plenty of calls on that and so that normally ended it oh that ended it did did any uh of the these politicians ever get uh out of line not with me not enough huffier but

22:09.815 --> 22:21.360
You know, another thing that I did that I'm proud of, I was on the faculty senate and I was on the executive committee and I chaired the committee that looked at academics and athletes.

22:21.577 --> 22:42.384
There was this idea of the football players, the low, you know, graduation rate and Shelby with his atrocious graduation rates for the basketball teams and yet the guys were playing and people playing a semester but not attending class because of their last.

22:42.484 --> 22:49.633
And so I took that on and knowing that that was not going to be a fun job.

22:49.653 --> 22:51.415
And so I chaired that.

22:52.137 --> 23:02.539
And we took college by college, took athlete, took sport by sport, athlete by athlete, and went through for the last three or four years.

23:03.261 --> 23:09.253
And we found, you know, where a lot of people were, had they been on the College of Business, they wouldn't have.

23:10.236 --> 23:12.340
For example, when I was deaning,

23:12.640 --> 23:29.047
Whoever was the, I can't recall the gentleman's name, but the fellow was in charge of the academic side for the athletes over there, he would call me and say, Sam, I see that so-and-so, you're going to drop so-and-so and so-and-so that's on probation.

23:29.608 --> 23:30.169
I said, yeah.

23:30.189 --> 23:32.893
He says, don't send out that drop letter.

23:33.481 --> 24:03.353
until monday and if i haven't found a home for them by monday you drop them so the guy would get out and then he would travel around campus and try to locate a home and then he'd say well i put so-and-so send so-and-so to this department in this college and so it became clear to me what what the academic the athlete and academic is no athlete is going to stay in school unless a dean lets him

24:05.510 --> 24:10.602
So you can't look at Coach Sherrill at that time or Coach Ballard.

24:10.923 --> 24:12.427
You can't look at Shelby Metcalf.

24:12.467 --> 24:13.589
You can't look at any of these.

24:14.211 --> 24:17.459
What you've got to look at is how does the dean run his program.

24:17.739 --> 24:19.283
And I guarantee you, you go right now.

24:20.478 --> 24:24.284
And you look at these two young men that are going pro.

24:25.866 --> 24:30.333
And one of them plays in the backfield.

24:31.615 --> 24:32.677
If you look at his record.

24:33.739 --> 24:36.403
It's time for him to leave academics?

24:36.423 --> 24:39.668
He failed to make a 2-0 any long semester.

24:41.926 --> 24:52.939
You know he he made a 3-0 in the summer one time and he made a 2-0 in the summer one time but never made a 2-0 in any long term yet a college kept him.

24:52.959 --> 24:59.928
Now what has happened of course is the college says I can't keep him and nobody else is going to put him up so what is the answer?

25:00.308 --> 25:04.173
I think I've found my way I'm going to go the NFL.

25:04.513 --> 25:06.075
I don't know about the other young man.

25:06.376 --> 25:10.060
Did you ever have anybody in behalf of academics

25:10.563 --> 25:13.167
try to strong arm you as assistant dean?

25:13.187 --> 25:13.888
No, no.

25:14.369 --> 25:16.833
They, no, uh-uh.

25:16.853 --> 25:19.116
Am I, no, absolutely not.

25:19.637 --> 25:25.806
And I think our reputation over here was, and of course you were gone by that time, Haskell, so you didn't experience it.

25:26.247 --> 25:26.848
Let's see.

25:27.810 --> 25:30.073
I've got a five o'clock,

25:30.374 --> 25:47.995
tennis date okay all right we'll be through by the end oh we need to be through in about 15 minutes oh about 15 minutes oh okay it's four o'clock now yeah and i got to go home and change clothes and you know okay 4 20 at the least all right um you you go back to why did you leave deanie

25:49.257 --> 25:54.545
Oh I think I'd done as much as I could it was uh it was it was same old same old.

25:54.925 --> 25:55.266
Okay.

25:55.286 --> 26:04.799
I'd taken it to where I wanted it or I could take it and if somebody's going to take it any place else it had to be somebody else other than me and you know just it just became a job.

26:05.120 --> 26:07.283
All right and you started out under

26:07.263 --> 26:08.064
Which dean?

26:08.665 --> 26:12.452
Started out deaning under Mews.

26:12.672 --> 26:12.952
Mews.

26:13.273 --> 26:14.936
And went up to Benton.

26:14.956 --> 26:17.941
Then Mobley, then Benton Kokenauer.

26:18.141 --> 26:20.184
Kokenauer, one year with Benton, I think, or two.

26:20.585 --> 26:26.655
How were they different in their dean style?

26:28.880 --> 26:32.084
I never really got to know Benton that well.

26:32.104 --> 26:34.327
You know I never got to.

26:35.048 --> 26:38.272
Were there any particular changes though in his when he came in?

26:42.357 --> 26:47.243
Oh yeah I think well I had to look at it from the undergraduate programs office.

26:47.443 --> 26:51.748
I think that he didn't want those standards that I had.

26:53.197 --> 26:57.689
Things now are not taken to the faculty, they're done by the EC.

26:58.872 --> 27:04.106
Policy's done up there and the faculty aren't involved in it.

27:06.232 --> 27:08.438
I felt that the faculty ought to be the

27:09.008 --> 27:20.987
the ones that should do that, kind of like the Faculty Center, but Benton doesn't, for some reason, and we've never discussed this, so I can't say those are my perceptions.

27:21.668 --> 27:27.237
And so I think just Benton wanted to change, and I was happy to make that change.

27:27.740 --> 27:51.417
and he brought in Bill first, moved him up to associate dean, and Dan Robertson went down to the graduate college, and Wynn Sharon came up and ran the MBA program, and we just kind of moved on.

27:52.118 --> 27:55.283
And so since then I've just helped out here as the department head.

27:55.415 --> 28:04.671
Did, as the Wiener building is being planned, did faculty have any... No, there was a faculty committee.

28:04.691 --> 28:05.352
Okay.

28:05.372 --> 28:15.229
And Don Hellriegel, you know, kind of carried this through and a fellow by the name of Wickern, Dean Wickern, who came as head of the

28:15.682 --> 28:21.252
Banner Department when John Dinko went over to run the computer facilities.

28:21.853 --> 28:26.922
And then Wicker moved up to Associate Dean and he kind of worked on the building.

28:26.962 --> 28:29.407
Don's worked on our addition that we had.

28:29.827 --> 28:31.851
So yeah, we got pretty much

28:31.831 --> 28:35.515
Did the building turn out pretty well?

28:35.936 --> 28:37.297
Fundamentally, yeah, it turned out right.

28:37.678 --> 28:43.744
We've got some classroom size anomalies, but we're going to solve those with the new wing that's coming on.

28:44.565 --> 28:55.017
And right at the moment, we knew at the time that we didn't have enough space, but we were also told that we could use the space that AG has.

28:55.558 --> 29:00.403
Well, AG says, yeah, you can have the space after we take out what we want.

29:00.383 --> 29:10.393
and so we get the tale you know of the distribution of rooms we get the the eight the eight o'clock and and the threes o'clock on and they get the rest of them

29:10.846 --> 29:17.673
How did the fun of moving to the Wainer Building compare with the fun of moving to the Blocker Building?

29:19.275 --> 29:22.518
This was, in terms, you mean the task of doing it?

29:22.619 --> 29:23.179
No, no, no.

29:23.299 --> 29:23.600
Oh.

29:23.620 --> 29:26.603
Because you all must have thought each of them was such a good step.

29:26.623 --> 29:27.143
Oh, yeah.

29:27.163 --> 29:27.564
Oh, yeah.

29:27.624 --> 29:30.127
This was, we were, we really loved it over here.

29:30.187 --> 29:31.828
This is, you know, a palace over here.

29:32.069 --> 29:34.251
And we thought the Blocker is a palace.

29:34.271 --> 29:37.174
And you go over to the Blocker now and it's pretty worn down.

29:37.154 --> 29:39.256
It needs a lot of work.

29:39.276 --> 29:41.879
The only thing we've had a problem with was some leaky windows here.

29:42.459 --> 29:46.043
But we've, you know, we've got, we've outgrown this building.

29:46.063 --> 29:49.166
In fact, we had already outgrown this building by the time we moved in.

29:50.787 --> 29:53.090
How large should the college of business be?

29:53.130 --> 29:54.791
I haven't, I don't know what that is.

29:54.872 --> 29:58.035
It can be as large as one as you want if you've got the faculty.

29:58.055 --> 29:58.555
We just can't.

29:58.855 --> 30:00.417
But what, I'm asking your opinion.

30:01.438 --> 30:04.461
Given the realities of A&M, how large should it be?

30:04.778 --> 30:06.761
I don't know what you mean by the realities of A&M.

30:06.822 --> 30:15.937
If you want to be a top flight school, really a top flight school, I think we've got to have some more faculty or smaller, a smaller undergraduate college.

30:15.957 --> 30:21.587
Now we're working at it, but again we, you know, there's the political realities.

30:21.607 --> 30:22.528
You can't get too small.

30:23.690 --> 30:29.841
When you, when, when you look at the University of Minnesota and it's, it's upper division programs,

30:30.580 --> 30:32.922
because you stay at a lot of anything, you get a pop-up.

30:33.923 --> 30:38.628
They don't have, they got less than 900 people, 900 undergraduates.

30:38.648 --> 30:39.989
You're talking about junior, senior level?

30:40.029 --> 30:41.711
Junior, senior level at the University of Minnesota.

30:41.791 --> 30:45.374
University of Illinois probably doesn't have 3,000.

30:45.414 --> 30:52.401
Oh, it has less, in total, probably has less than 1,500 undergraduates.

30:52.421 --> 30:53.822
But yet their reputations.

30:54.503 --> 30:56.164
You know, you've got great reputations.

30:56.465 --> 30:57.325
Great reputations.

30:57.646 --> 31:00.148
All right, let's make believe now you're the consultant.

31:00.938 --> 31:06.388
to the Texas A&M College of Business, what advice would you give them for now and the future?

31:06.969 --> 31:13.402
Oh, I wouldn't know what that was, Haskell.

31:14.303 --> 31:18.812
There are too many political realities to this thing.
