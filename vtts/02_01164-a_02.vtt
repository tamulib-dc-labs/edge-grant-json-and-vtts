WEBVTT

00:05.549 --> 00:13.181
This is going to be your personal opinion, but I'm 
trying to build up a consensus, if there is one, by

00:05.549 --> 00:13.181
adding up personal opinion. What do you think the 
taxpayers and the general public in this country

00:13.201 --> 00:20.272
think of planetary astronomy in particular and 
just astronomy in general? I think the public's

00:21.033 --> 00:29.407
very interested in astronomy, and to the average 
person on the street, planetary astronomy is

00:21.033 --> 00:29.407
probably most of astronomy. I mean, they've heard 
a lot from Sagan. which emphasizes, although not

00:31.233 --> 00:34.597
exclusively, planetary astronomy. And they see 
stuff in the media frequently on sexy things like

00:35.639 --> 00:41.326
black holes, but they don't understand them. On 
the other hand, if you show them a picture of

00:41.346 --> 00:58.489
Jupiter or a satellite of the outer solar system or 
a volcano on Mars, they'll figure out quite

00:41.346 --> 00:58.489
quickly where it was, how that image was obtained, 
and maybe in some cases be able to tell you why

00:41.346 --> 00:58.489
they'd like to see more. So I think, in fact, it's 
extremely important for science in this country

00:58.807 --> 01:06.534
to continue the planetary program with vigor. Do 
you think the public ought to have that view? Sure.

01:10.717 --> 01:11.117
Why not? It doesn't matter. It's close. It's 
easier to touch. You can see Jupiter at night and

01:13.119 --> 01:14.941
recognize it. You know, to point out to your kids 
that it's not just a star, but it's a big, giant,

01:15.401 --> 01:23.748
gaseous world with little planets around it. Why 
not? Here's another two-part question. And your

01:29.232 --> 01:32.496
point's probably fairly important here. Do you 
think planetary astronomers have done a good job

01:33.297 --> 01:38.062
of selling themselves to the public and Congress? 
And do you think that astronomers as a whole have

01:38.122 --> 01:44.269
done a good job doing that? It's hard to answer. The 
second one I can answer, recently I think there's

01:46.632 --> 01:56.843
been some counter examples or examples of 
negative salesmanship, bickering. to Congress

01:57.380 --> 02:07.173
trying to go pork and anti-pork for things like the 
Gemini project, probably quite

01:57.380 --> 02:07.173
counterproductive. So politicizing future 
projects with NSF and NASA as a funding agency is

02:08.034 --> 02:15.423
probably a bad idea. As far as planetary astronomy 
being successful, well, you'd like to think so. On

02:20.370 --> 02:23.995
the other hand, look at the number of missions 
planned and canceled of late. So in fact, from that

02:24.015 --> 02:25.817
aspect, despite the fact that these things are 
moderately inexpensive compared to manned

02:27.215 --> 02:36.546
exploration of near-Earth environment or 
anything else. They aren't getting full funding.

02:38.709 --> 02:42.713
It's just a tough time for space science, I 
suppose. We've both done some optical and some

02:44.615 --> 02:48.480
radio astronomy.

02:52.274 --> 02:59.184
First of all, radio astronomy never had a sneering 
attitude towards planetary work. Now, is this

02:59.204 --> 03:03.751
just because the planets were bright sources that 
could be identified? Or was it because both of them

03:05.353 --> 03:09.839
in the 50s had this pariah status? Well, the radio 
astronomer, I'm not sure the radio astronomers

03:10.580 --> 03:13.585
had pariah status. They were just regarded as 
different because their backgrounds weren't...

03:16.389 --> 03:16.889
Engineers. They were engineers, and they 
certainly knew how to use, you know, slide rule

03:16.909 --> 03:22.197
and... some electronic test equipment. 
Soldering iron. It's definitely a soldering iron

03:26.613 --> 03:28.776
and plenty of solder. I wasn't completely 
scorned. I don't know. No, I think they were

03:33.060 --> 03:34.502
treated differently. They may have been not 
mainstream, but I don't think they were

03:34.522 --> 03:40.508
particularly pariahs. And as far as planetary 
astronomy making an impact, as soon as Jupiter was

03:40.528 --> 03:51.660
just slightly beyond discovered at low frequency 
from the first radiation by Franklin and Burt,

03:52.130 --> 03:54.393
right? Then Venus got detected, I think, in 56 or 57 
first. No one believed it quite that fast. With a

04:03.846 --> 04:09.935
high brightness temperature, and after a little 
while, we realized that that wouldn't go away, and

04:03.846 --> 04:09.935
you had to figure out what the reason was. So that 
played a big role around 1960, plus or minus three,

04:09.975 --> 04:19.588
on each side of 1960, in the development of 
planetary physics. How come with this future

04:21.053 --> 04:35.789
planning and tenure plans and all this sort of 
stuff, the radio astronomers always seem to have

04:21.053 --> 04:35.789
their fights and their bloodlettings behind 
locked doors and come out with a unified thing,

04:21.053 --> 04:35.789
whereas the optical people stage public 
spectacles? It's so painful. Why does this always

04:36.570 --> 04:38.191
continue? I mean, I've heard this repeated many 
times. I don't know the answer. I mean, it's a

04:45.519 --> 04:49.624
sensible part of science to disagree on technical 
details. That's normal. but you're not supposed

04:52.306 --> 04:55.049
to involve Congress in it. Which doesn't 
understand the technical details in general.

04:58.132 --> 04:59.454
Definitely not, and probably doesn't care. And 
once they hear some argument, they figure, oh,

04:59.514 --> 05:08.504
both of these sides are quite silly, and let's 
listen to them for a few minutes and go on to

04:59.514 --> 05:08.504
something more serious. Yeah, I don't know the 
answer to that, but it does seem to always be the

05:09.825 --> 05:12.468
case. I would have thought we'd got over that 10 
years ago. I mean, even the high-energy

05:15.872 --> 05:20.777
physicists have gotten their act together, which 
with that bunch of, Queen Bee seems incredible.

05:25.413 --> 05:27.456
Yeah, I don't know how black and white the 
situation is. I'm pretty unplugged to that, but

05:27.496 --> 05:49.684
certainly ever since I got to think about 
astropolitics, it's always been the case that the

05:27.496 --> 05:49.684
radio astronomers have been well enough prepared 
in advance that they had a chance to get something

05:27.496 --> 05:49.684
while the optical folks bit and scratched, mostly 
scratched each other pretty badly, yeah. With

05:49.833 --> 05:59.904
some exceptions, I mean the National Observatory 
in the early days at least went quickly from an 0.9

05:49.833 --> 05:59.904
to a 2.1 to 2.4 meter telescopes, but after that 
it's pretty much turned off.

06:03.348 --> 06:09.515
Planetary astronomy found out a lot of things 
about the solar system in the last 30 years. All you

06:09.555 --> 06:14.541
have to do is compare Baker's 7th edition or 
something like that and it's just a whole

06:09.555 --> 06:14.541
different solar system. Do you think that's 
really changed the way the general public thinks

06:15.736 --> 06:20.782
about anything? I've got a whole list here, the way 
they've thought about Earth, solar system, the

06:20.802 --> 06:25.708
universe, planetary astronomy, astronomy. Can 
you be more explicit? I mean, give me an example.

06:28.271 --> 06:35.881
Has it really changed the way

06:28.271 --> 06:35.881
people think about, well, for example, science? 
Do you think that all these discoveries have made

06:36.461 --> 06:43.029
people say, hey, these scientists can really do 
something and can really find out stuff? I think

06:43.049 --> 06:45.152
they've thought that that's the case. since World 
War II. I think the application of science to the

06:47.961 --> 07:04.625
conflict, World War II and the Cold War, told 
people that science was important, if not

06:47.961 --> 07:04.625
necessarily completely without 
disqualification or sin. There's been a lot of, I

07:05.045 --> 07:15.460
don't know if you want to call it 
pseudo-philosophical comments to the effect

07:05.045 --> 07:15.460
that now that we can get out and see that Earth is 
just one little planet among others and all this

07:05.045 --> 07:15.460
sort of stuff. Do you think that's really affected 
the general public?

07:21.338 --> 07:26.125
Slightly from the ecological point of view, but 
not enormously. I think the lumber companies are

07:26.906 --> 07:34.618
still quite happy to cut all the old growth and the 
owls be damned.

07:36.001 --> 07:40.688
Okay, 30 years ago there was still a chance that 
there was life on Mars. And now we've been to all the

07:42.068 --> 07:52.178
major planets except Pluto, and no evidence so far 
of any life on any planet, particularly no little

07:42.068 --> 07:52.178
green men on Mars, not even a bug. Do you think 
that's had any effect on funding and public

07:52.198 --> 07:58.425
interest for planetary astronomy, astronomy, 
and science in general? I don't think so. I don't

07:59.466 --> 08:00.046
think so. Anyway, we haven't explored Jupiter 
thoroughly, right? I mean, there's still

08:03.069 --> 08:05.251
possibilities for floaters. Of course, the 
alternative is if they would have found one

08:05.271 --> 08:08.835
microbe on Mars... We'd be standing there now 
probably. Oh, yeah, no, no, that's true. I mean,

08:12.998 --> 08:24.176
certainly if the results had been very, very 
different from Vikings, more or less negative

08:12.998 --> 08:24.176
results, that we'd want to track it down or 
certainly make sure it wasn't something we

08:12.998 --> 08:24.176
carried along. Yep, hitchhikers are welcome. 
Yes, I agree with what you're saying. But I don't

08:28.963 --> 08:33.490
think it's had an enormously negative effect 
because I think most people are. slightly cynical

08:34.280 --> 08:37.064
and didn't really expect to see much. It would have 
been interesting if they had found fossils. Hard

08:41.349 --> 08:42.791
to do with the experiments on. We don't know that. 
We still may. Of course, the only two lander pros

08:44.874 --> 08:50.101
were landed for engineering reasons. 
Absolutely. They're lousy places to look for

08:50.762 --> 08:56.890
anything interesting because they don't have 
previous water flow history. Now,

08:57.551 --> 09:00.355
unfortunately, this question that I that I wrote 
down here, it says your institution, but Lick is

09:01.448 --> 09:09.159
now separate from Berkeley, but isn't in all 
the... Lick is a statewide institution, per se.

09:09.179 --> 09:13.446
It's called Organized Research Unit, and it 
serves all campuses. Okay, well then let's just

09:13.546 --> 09:16.070
take Berkeley here. You mentioned how Carl came 
here for a while and got interest started, and you

09:16.470 --> 09:23.420
still have some interest in planetary astronomy. 
Do you have any planetary astronomy group here or

09:23.440 --> 09:26.124
anything like that? Not really a group, but Imke de 
Potter is very interested and works... almost

09:30.220 --> 09:37.587
full-time on planetary problems, radio mostly, 
radio magnetospheres, radio thermal radiation

09:30.220 --> 09:37.587
from all the planets. She's had a student who just 
finished a thesis on the thermal radiation from

09:38.488 --> 09:45.255
Mercury is measured radio interferometry. So 
there's a bit going on. Also, the geology

09:47.016 --> 09:49.099
department would like to be in it. They're not 
quite sure how to do that. So there's interest in

09:51.841 --> 09:55.705
geology, but nothing much yet to show for it. How 
come this place never developed a strong

09:56.697 --> 10:02.643
planetary thing, just other things? Just breaks 
of the game, a lot of strong people in other fields.

10:08.468 --> 10:09.649
It's hard to cover every base. We don't have much in 
solar either. But never any implied attitude that

10:11.411 --> 10:16.215
you shouldn't do that? No, no. Okay. What do you 
think the taxpayers got out of the money they

10:19.018 --> 10:23.582
funneled into the space program over there? the 
past 30 years as far as planetary astronomy goes?

10:26.304 --> 10:28.828
Oh, a lot, because it's a wonderful frontier. More 
in planetary, more tangible stuff in planetary

10:28.888 --> 10:32.033
than anything else. And we can point to moon rocks 
and say, hey, if you're interested, we'll tell you

10:32.554 --> 10:36.640
how old that rock is. That rock is older than 
anything you walked on. Probably. Probably. So,

10:42.128 --> 10:44.191
yeah, I think they've done reasonably well. I 
mean, you know, it's hard to justify the bucks for a

10:44.231 --> 10:47.315
launch, but what can you do? So I think they've 
gotten a lot of thrills, too. Do you think

10:49.899 --> 10:53.164
planetary astronomy is a real... accepted now by 
most other astronomers? Most. Most. Still a few

10:58.466 --> 10:59.607
holdouts. Maybe. Not that many. But, you know, I 
don't like all kinds of astronomy. Some I know

11:03.491 --> 11:05.854
there, but there's some things I wouldn't bother 
to do. A lot of people have been getting a lot of

11:07.195 --> 11:12.581
mileage lately in the, quote, planetary, 
unquote, field. I just wrote down four things

11:12.781 --> 11:15.404
here. There might be more. One is the search for 
extraterrestrial intelligence. One is search

11:19.709 --> 11:21.651
for other solar systems. Another one is the hole in 
Earth's ozone layer, and one finding

11:23.063 --> 11:33.192
and deflecting killer asteroids and comets. You 
think they've overdone that? Well, not that much.

11:39.217 --> 11:41.079
I mean, the ozone hole is real, right? So you hardly 
want to see your grandchildren have to wear a

11:41.659 --> 11:48.525
Dodger hat every time they go out in the sun in 20 
years. So that's something that clearly is a

11:48.545 --> 11:52.969
man-made situation which can be probably 
improved by ecological care in the future. So

12:00.808 --> 12:02.951
that's probably, of these, the most important 
thing. SETI is the most whimsical, but still has a

12:03.932 --> 12:08.817
small outside chance of success. And there, of 
course, the stakes are very large. So it's like a

12:11.481 --> 12:12.402
lottery. And that would be exciting. And I'd be 
somewhat cynical about the chances for instant

12:14.965 --> 12:20.111
success, but who knows? Killer asteroids? The 
statistics are fairly straightforward that

12:23.999 --> 12:33.868
there are asteroidal impacts that are going to 
release a lot of kinetic energy. Certainly going

12:34.649 --> 12:36.731
to ruin the Tuesday tea party. Right, so that's 
fine whether you can deflect them or want to

12:38.432 --> 12:43.997
deflect them if we knew enough how to do that. It's a 
different constituency, which might not be my

12:44.017 --> 12:50.283
favorite fans. Other solar systems are likely 
events, and we don't quite know how to find them.

12:54.533 --> 12:58.278
When you can find a dust cloud around Beta 
Pictoris, that's fine. Whether that really has

12:58.338 --> 13:04.866
anything to do with another solar system is 
unknown, but it's a kind of lead we would like to

12:58.338 --> 13:04.866
follow up in a variety of ways. So looking, for 
example, for objects of few Jovian masses by radio

13:05.406 --> 13:19.183
velocities of the parent star are projects going 
on now which are quite worthwhile and don't tap the

13:19.332 --> 13:21.915
resources very deeply and should continue. 
Chances of success are hard to measure, but

13:22.275 --> 13:26.219
probably pretty good. Here's a question, and I 
think you can put them together, because both

13:27.841 --> 13:45.120
planetary astronomers and regular astronomers 
are complaining about the budget crunch, but of

13:27.841 --> 13:45.120
course there's even now vastly more money per 
astronomer available than there was in the late

13:27.841 --> 13:45.120
1950s, right? Yeah, because then there wasn't 
any. We learned to do without. But that wasn't so

13:48.186 --> 13:49.167
good. I mean, you know, use it up, wear it out, make 
it do. We learned that. And that's not necessarily

13:53.452 --> 13:56.716
the most efficient way to proceed. It does make you 
self-reliant. But what do you think about, and

13:58.618 --> 14:07.048
I'll lump together planetary astronomy with 
astronomy, because if somebody pulls the plug in a

13:58.618 --> 14:07.048
bathtub, all the little rubber duckies are going 
to ground.

14:10.151 --> 14:11.313
What's the state of it today? Plateau? Seems like a 
plateau, but the problem... is the number of

14:15.442 --> 14:25.891
people who want money are increasing and 
expectations are increasing sort of

14:15.442 --> 14:25.891
proportional to the prospects in the field, which 
are good. So it's a disappointment in the sense

14:25.931 --> 14:31.376
that our expectations get higher all the time. So 
the exponent is greater than one. Yeah, I think so.

14:35.559 --> 14:44.807
And, well, would you agree that it just can't keep 
increasing at the rate it's been doing, say,

14:35.559 --> 14:44.807
during the 70s or during the 60s? Yeah, there it was 
very high, but it could increase a little bit. Keep

14:49.973 --> 14:53.919
us from fighting among ourselves all the time for 
the remaining scraps. There are more

14:53.940 --> 14:59.488
degree-granting institutions than ever and more 
new PhDs than ever. How long can that go on? Not

15:00.650 --> 15:01.171
forever. We've got more than we need. Right. I 
mean, you just can't employ them all gainfully.

15:06.639 --> 15:10.425
Also, there's a rather substantial influx of 
astronomers from other fields. So it isn't just

15:10.445 --> 15:13.630
that we're training too many PhDs, but the field is 
successful. So the numbers I've heard quoted

15:14.251 --> 15:21.280
around recently is something like 135, roughly, 
PhDs per year in astronomy. And there aren't

15:22.401 --> 15:26.206
nearly that many positions. So they often go into 
postdocs as a holding position for some years. On

15:30.171 --> 15:36.979
the other hand, the number of people calling 
themselves astronomers or becoming members of

15:30.171 --> 15:36.979
AAS increases at about twice that rate. So it must 
mean an influx from physics and other associated

15:37.420 --> 15:40.984
fields. So even if we were to cut back enormously on 
productivity of new PhDs, it wouldn't completely

15:41.268 --> 15:51.984
solve the problem.

15:52.004 --> 15:59.695
We forgot to go into some detail about Gerard de 
Bacallure, who was unusual in that he did

15:52.004 --> 15:59.695
planetary and galaxy research. Right. He walked 
both sides of the street in a very unusual way in the

16:00.416 --> 16:06.765
1950s, 60s, and even later. He was a good advocate 
of planetary astronomy. wrote a good book on Mars,

16:09.922 --> 16:14.687
which was a distillation of many observations. 
Not all of them survived, but it was influential.

16:18.372 --> 16:31.907
And he did very good stuff on galaxies, probably 
was one of the leader in statistical work on galaxy

16:18.372 --> 16:31.907
properties from Hubble's death to maybe 1970. 
Quite an impressive guy to be able to do that that

16:33.169 --> 16:35.531
well. So I shouldn't have omitted him earlier. 
Certainly he was a well-respected person that

16:39.166 --> 16:43.053
could do either. Well, we just noticed that when 
you applied for telescope time at McDonald in

16:43.493 --> 17:01.444
early 1963, de Bacalura wrote you a letter dated 
February 4, 1963, in which he said there's a good

16:43.493 --> 17:01.444
possibility of JPL buying time at McDonald 
Observatory. And he sounded quite favorable.

17:04.380 --> 17:04.600
Right. So I'm not sure what happened next. 
Obviously, it never panned out. It was never a

17:07.966 --> 17:09.128
penny spent. He recommends that you send a formal 
application to Dr. W.W. Morgan at Yerkes

17:09.148 --> 17:14.157
Observatory. And then here's the next letter 
saying, in a famous phrase we both remember, a

17:14.398 --> 17:24.175
famous sentence, I regret to have to inform you 
that the observing program for the McDonald

17:14.398 --> 17:24.175
82-inch is saturated.

17:26.780 --> 17:27.060
And? I would have supposed that you would have made 
arrangements through Caltech to obtain

17:28.103 --> 17:32.809
observing time locally. These were very 
frustrating times. It's interesting that Morgan

17:37.376 --> 17:43.043
actually was a nicer guy than I thought at the time. 
So I don't think he was particularly mad at me. It's

17:47.864 --> 17:52.554
interesting that just a year and a half later, 
McDonald completely opened up to planetary work.

17:52.634 --> 17:53.075
Yes, right. But it wasn't because of either of 
those people, although DeVocalor certainly

17:53.155 --> 17:57.545
wouldn't have minded. No, that was Smitty's 
influence, which had an enormous positive change

17:58.066 --> 18:04.219
there.
