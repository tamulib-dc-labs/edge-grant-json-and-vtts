WEBVTT

00:02.123 --> 00:05.088
I wanted to move on to your next job.

00:07.772 --> 00:14.062
I went into the advisory program, which was the 
Military Assistance Command Vietnam, or MACV.

00:16.065 --> 00:26.342
And it was the chance to move away from American 
units

00:16.065 --> 00:26.342
into an American compound But you went out and 
worked counterparts. You had a Vietnamese across

00:29.272 --> 00:32.436
the desk from you, the job assignment. You were the 
advisor to them. And I think that's one of the

00:37.041 --> 00:42.967
problems some of our higher level commanders had. 
You did not run the Vietnamese army. You merely

00:46.310 --> 00:52.597
provided advice they could accept or reject. One 
of the problems was you had to prove to them

00:58.435 --> 01:02.539
Which, once again, took up time until you get to the 
point they're happy that you're trustworthy. You

01:02.979 --> 01:07.743
know, every month, every six months, or every 
year, in walks a new American to do this job. And as

01:07.763 --> 01:13.729
one of them remarked was, when asked, why don't you 
guys press the war harder? You can fight hard as you

01:14.309 --> 01:15.490
want. You're here for a year. I'm here for the rest 
of my life. Yeah. You know, I've got my fixed amount

01:20.475 --> 01:26.080
of time unless I do something unusual to stay 
there. I do my job, I arrive, I learn my job, I

01:26.701 --> 01:32.929
perform my job, I get nervous about leaving and I 
leave. The next American walks in, usually with

01:34.191 --> 01:41.680
about a three-day overlap from you to me, and says, 
hi, I'm your replacement. He says, I'm so glad to

01:41.700 --> 01:43.162
see you here. I thought they might want to keep me. 
And you take him over and you introduce him to his

01:45.545 --> 01:52.735
counterpart, your best friend after a year at 
least, a trustee. And who are you? I'm the new

01:53.456 --> 01:54.577
American here. What's going on? And he spends the 
next 30, 60, 90 days trying to find out where North

01:57.143 --> 02:02.229
is. So we had a problem. They had a problem. There 
was also the question, I guess looking at it, that

02:08.437 --> 02:14.424
whether the best went to the advisory program or 
whatever. The emphasis was big unit battles. Big

02:18.769 --> 02:20.471
unit battles didn't win the war. The question may 
have been and always remain that one, The war was

02:26.692 --> 02:29.776
probably lost in the hamlets, the villages. This 
is where the advisor lived and died. He lived in the

02:34.641 --> 02:35.943
mud outpost. You ate with him. You wore the same 
armament or lack of armament they wore. You didn't

02:43.731 --> 02:48.817
wear, with the Vietnamese army, you didn't wear 
American flag vests and steel helmets when you

02:43.731 --> 02:48.817
went on patrol. You wore your shirt open to the 
sleeve, you know, sleeves up like theirs, lightly

02:49.338 --> 02:55.585
armed. They wore tennis shoes. You wore your 
boots. You carried your chopsticks in your

02:59.638 --> 03:01.420
pocket. What we tried to do, and I think it was the 
part that was successful in Vietnam,

03:03.182 --> 03:15.537
first you had to prove you were there to stay, which 
was a difficult thing to do, particularly when you

03:03.182 --> 03:15.537
left every year. Beyond the individual leaving, 
we had to say, if you trust us, you risk your life. My

03:22.786 --> 03:25.369
advice is this is how we fight the war. That's not 
what the problem is. Don't you understand? And you

03:28.629 --> 03:31.013
would hang on to what the problem was. And this was 
going on forever. The time you learned your job,

03:37.223 --> 03:39.406
you were through. It was time to go. In other words, 
they tell one of the things in Vietnam, the first 30

03:42.371 --> 03:47.539
days, you got killed because you were stupid. The 
next 10 months, you did your job. The last 30 days,

03:52.484 --> 03:55.510
you got killed because you were too cautious. You 
were worried about dying. I'm short. I'm real

03:59.197 --> 04:00.359
short. You counted days. When days got too small, 
you switched to hours, then jumped to minutes. And

04:06.170 --> 04:10.138
everybody that ever went could tell you how long 
they were there. It's just one of these. And

04:12.948 --> 04:18.296
depending on where you were, some units had the 
short timer stick, others no different symbol.

04:18.616 --> 04:22.662
But everybody marked or counted and you knew about 
where you were. And I say that it's a relative, how

04:22.702 --> 04:25.787
close am I? You weren't safe in Vietnam until you 
were out of there. That's the only safe, that was

04:31.175 --> 04:37.865
the only way you knew you lived over Vietnam was 
you're over international water and you're on

04:31.175 --> 04:37.865
your way home. Till then, than you think of Gary? 
You were fair game.

04:47.598 --> 04:56.506
I think the hardest thing we had to do and learn was 
we were guests of their government. And as guests,

04:56.526 --> 05:08.998
you had to learn to conduct yourself with certain

04:56.526 --> 05:08.998
actions that you might not have done had it been 
your home versus their home. If the Vietnamese

05:09.721 --> 05:16.252
said, we don't want to go on the operation until 10 
o'clock in the morning, you wait until 10 o'clock,

05:09.721 --> 05:16.252
even though you knew by 10 o'clock everything's 
over. So you worked on the next three weeks, four

05:16.693 --> 05:21.962
weeks, a month, trying to get them to say, look, 
let's do this differently. Maybe try this, but you

05:22.022 --> 05:27.811
had to make their commander believe he thought of 
it. If you walked up to me, and I'm the American, and

05:29.414 --> 05:34.142
you're the Vietnamese, and I said, do it, He may do 
it because he knows your radio calls for the

05:36.485 --> 05:43.036
helicopter in case he's wounded. But he doesn't 
have any authority left in front of his men. So you

05:48.004 --> 05:52.412
make him believe he discovered this thought in the 
middle of the night on his own. And he runs out the

05:52.993 --> 05:55.857
next morning and does what you whispered in his 
ear. And you can't stand up and holler, well, hot

05:56.579 --> 05:58.983
dogs, he did it. I told him and he did it. You just 
stand there. And when you get away from each other,

06:03.586 --> 06:08.733
away from them back in your own compound or with 
your other crew, we got it. Now let's hope it works.

06:15.503 --> 06:18.648
And they had to see it in their system. And what we 
did to their system that hurt was we copied it after

06:19.129 --> 06:23.755
ours. In other words, we decided instead of us 
learning their way, they'll learn our way. So we

06:30.705 --> 06:33.289
made the Vietnamese military... a replica or a 
model of the American Army with all its great

06:34.045 --> 06:41.614
logistical support, which they didn't have. And 
then you wonder, I wonder why they can't do that.

06:50.003 --> 06:53.347
And you face that problem. You know, we, at least on 
a large scale with the advisors, we had at one time

06:53.367 --> 07:02.618
there about 20,000 at the top levels. top number of 
advisors in South Vietnam, had them assigned to

07:03.357 --> 07:08.529
all the provinces. We had within the advisory 
program a thing called a MAT team, a mobile

07:08.589 --> 07:18.632
advisory team, which roamed around.

07:20.671 --> 07:22.593
vagabonds as far as where they live. They went from 
job to job to job. The unit I was on was a province

07:25.096 --> 07:27.198
team. We had a fixed responsibility just like a 
state or a county line. We worked in a particular

07:30.441 --> 07:40.272
place with the forces that were there, but we would 
have mobile teams come through the area, do

07:30.441 --> 07:40.272
specific problem-solving for us, do operations. 
After we were successful, the Vietnamese took

07:40.752 --> 07:42.794
over. This unit went on somewhere else and worked 
for the next Vietnamese unit. Americans were with

07:48.835 --> 07:52.542
you in the province? We had 100 assigned at the 
team. 100 officers and men. Total men. In your

08:01.260 --> 08:02.482
team? In the intelligence business, we had four at 
province level. We would have... one or two,

08:09.794 --> 08:17.423
normally an officer and a sergeant, and each one of 
the subsectors are districts. So what you really

08:18.364 --> 08:32.681
had in the intelligence business was about, in our 
province with Benoit, we had six districts, so you

08:18.364 --> 08:32.681
probably had at best 13, 14 people, which did not 
work for you. Now listen carefully to this one. I'm

08:34.883 --> 08:36.325
on the province team But the other Americans are 
advisors to the Vietnamese at each level of their

08:36.659 --> 08:44.250
operation. I had no team. I had myself, my American 
NCO.

08:50.660 --> 08:54.486
I was the advisor to the Vietnamese intelligence 
officer at the province.

08:57.470 --> 08:58.792
I could advise him all I wanted. If he didn't want to 
take it, you couldn't make him. They went through

09:02.057 --> 09:03.359
the game, by the way. They were very good at 
learning what we were good at watching. They

09:06.697 --> 09:15.449
always wanted more typewriters, pens, pencils, 
chairs, goodies, because it was a status symbol.

09:15.629 --> 09:21.597
How many things... Let's talk about, let's you and 
I go to the woods and collect intelligence. Kind of

09:23.239 --> 09:25.262
exciting. A lot of them didn't want to go to the 
woods. You live longer not going to the woods.

09:31.970 --> 09:32.451
But... what we had and the hardest thing to learn 
and our commanders and i say the commanders the the

09:32.988 --> 09:57.730
province senior advisor are actually the ones we 
worried about the province senior advisor was a

09:32.988 --> 09:57.730
civilian the deputy was the military and always 
used the term the it was deputy but we just called

09:32.988 --> 09:57.730
him the boss because he was the colonel and i'm not 
sure that they ever really

10:00.612 --> 10:04.597
got out at the end, understood what happened or 
didn't happen in the field. If you had reports to do

10:04.617 --> 10:12.848
that said an area was safer and we had a thing called 
the Hess Report Hamilton Evaluation System. One

10:12.868 --> 10:16.112
month you raise one village, you lower the other 
one. Nobody spent the night out there. The village

10:21.859 --> 10:24.122
chief didn't even spend the night out there. But on 
paper, we pacified the area. In real life, go on out

10:27.324 --> 10:35.396
there, but be sure you're back before 5 o'clock or 
don't worry about being back. Don't wait on

10:36.498 --> 10:37.720
sundown. Don't plan on eating supper and 
strolling down the street at midnight in these

10:37.760 --> 10:47.075
villages, not unless you took a lot of guns with 
you. And we played this paper chase game. It all

10:51.221 --> 10:52.523
looked good on paper. But the problem was that's 
where the war, that's where the fighting was being

10:53.347 --> 10:59.958
done that we were doing was on paper. And that left 
some problem areas and some things there.

11:07.571 --> 11:16.085
What did a typical operation in this capacity 
consist of? Well, what you had, your normal, if you

11:16.465 --> 11:19.911
were at province headquarters, You were 
responsible, much like the order of battle

11:20.836 --> 11:25.721
section for the intelligence picture in the 
province. Except this time, instead of having

11:26.982 --> 11:33.930
American troops who collected the data, you had 
Vietnamese, the national police, their army. We

11:36.192 --> 11:44.241
had a thing at the province level called the PRU's 
Province Recon Unit, which worked directly for

11:36.192 --> 11:44.241
the province chief who were trained and directed 
by us. In other words, you had 50 guys, you'd train,

11:45.582 --> 11:48.345
equip, You got them M16s, legally or otherwise, 
American uniforms, boots, ammunition. You

11:55.119 --> 11:59.804
trained them as a private mercenary reaction 
force to do what you wanted done. When the

12:00.365 --> 12:03.788
intelligence came in, you had somebody to go. The 
district chiefs is where the actual collection

12:05.329 --> 12:09.393
went on. The National Police had a thing called the 
National Police Field Force. We had an alphabet

12:14.839 --> 12:19.243
organization of collectors there. census 
grievance, we had people under all kinds of names

12:19.865 --> 12:30.858
and covers out in the woods, out in the villages, 
trying to collect data about the other side. What

12:32.521 --> 12:39.449
our normal job there was was to convince the 
Vietnamese, okay, we've got enough, or they would

12:32.521 --> 12:39.449
come to you and said, we want an operation. Our job 
then was to make sure we got the helicopters, we got

12:39.569 --> 12:44.856
the assets they needed to get them out there. Or, in 
some cases, they would come to us have a lot of data,

12:49.868 --> 12:54.834
but they couldn't do it because so-and-so was kin 
to somebody. The old power game. The

12:59.339 --> 13:01.902
brother-in-law of the relative of. And at this 
time, sometimes our side of the organization

13:03.724 --> 13:07.569
might mount an operation. Just go bag him. We know 
who it is. And after you bring him in, let them

13:13.556 --> 13:16.560
explain how he got there. He doesn't know how he got 
there. Hi, who are you? Let's go. Midnight Hook.

13:23.453 --> 13:25.616
We'll go get them. Those were less rare. What you 
normally had was you would go out with the

13:27.199 --> 13:35.290
Vietnamese unit, go in a village, you walk through 
the same village every day. The day you walk in and

13:35.310 --> 13:37.493
grab whoever you're after. You may have a team set 
in the jungle and watch them for three or four

13:37.996 --> 13:41.760
months and then grab them. It's just, it was what 
level of proof do you want somebody to work for the

13:42.742 --> 13:47.347
other side? Do you want three reports from the 
laundry woman that so-and-so is a communist? Do

13:53.875 --> 13:56.218
you want him in a meeting with a communist? It was 
how much proof and what level do you go get him? Do

13:59.662 --> 14:00.883
you want him carrying a gun? Depending on what it 
was, you'd go out and try to round them up. And it

14:06.616 --> 14:12.543
depended on if the district chief wanted to make 
himself look good to the province chief, he ran and

14:06.616 --> 14:12.543
got one. He also may have saved one so when things 
got rough and tough, he had a spare. You see, they

14:18.870 --> 14:21.933
were there forever, too, and they were appointed 
by the province chief. The district chiefs owed

14:22.013 --> 14:28.581
their job to the province chief, who owed his job to 
the military command. So it was one gigantic

14:28.641 --> 14:31.324
bureaucratic thing. You scratch my back, and I'll 
scratch yours. You knife me, and I'll stab you. And

14:38.168 --> 14:43.897
you had to learn to work your way through it. What 
pleased one boss might not please the other, and be

14:43.917 --> 14:47.843
careful. So you worked with Arvin and the National 
Guard? We worked, the level we worked with, we

14:51.028 --> 14:53.933
didn't work with the Arvins at all. The province 
commander had some. We worked with what would be

14:56.577 --> 14:59.421
the National Guard units, the regional police, 
The RFPF, the Regional Forced Popular Force. This

15:03.952 --> 15:07.378
was where the war was won or lost, the village 
troops. The two squads in the village, you had to

15:07.919 --> 15:14.611
learn, and finally when you were good, you went out 
around the villages and you stayed in different

15:07.919 --> 15:14.611
places at different times. Not because you wanted 
to, but because you wanted them to see you out

15:14.711 --> 15:18.237
there. Here's the American. He's out here to show 
you you can do it, you can catch them. And you'd go

15:26.030 --> 15:27.793
out and conduct raids for them. We also lived 
normally at the district headquarters. The MAT

15:32.820 --> 15:34.322
teams lived in the villages. We had the ones that 
went out.

15:38.909 --> 15:47.522
Normally you lived in the village in one location 
inside of this unless something happened and you

15:38.909 --> 15:47.522
had to move.

15:47.542 --> 15:55.193
Can you sort of describe a typical operation in the 
field, something that you went on, some unique one

15:47.542 --> 15:55.193
that stands out in your mind? I guess one that would 
be, I won't say unique, but it stands out as one of

15:55.797 --> 16:22.009
the different ones, is we went out, we had an 
intelligence problem with one of our units that no

15:55.797 --> 16:22.009
matter what we did, the other side seemed to either 
know we were coming, they could either stand and

15:55.797 --> 16:22.009
fight, and what bothered us was you would go out 
with the Vietnamese, take the hill when you got to

15:55.797 --> 16:22.009
the top, the little old ladies are waiting up there 
with beer and Coca-Cola iced down to sell it to you.

16:22.029 --> 16:24.252
They could have been waiting there to kill you. 
Someone was telling them, you know, they're

16:25.109 --> 16:29.015
coming. They're going to be here at 10 o'clock or 8 
o'clock or whatever time. The one funny one that

16:33.521 --> 16:36.225
happened on that run, we went out. We normally did 
not have aircraft at this level. In other words,

16:41.652 --> 16:43.395
you didn't own any planes. You had to call ahead for 
a month and say on the 10th of next month, I want five

16:43.415 --> 16:50.084
helicopters, ten helicopters for an operation. 
You might or might not get them. We went on one that

16:52.902 --> 16:56.086
when we went out, we turned into a rice paddy. Just 
when they went in on final approach to flare, we saw

16:57.247 --> 17:04.176
sunlight reflecting off the water, but it was 
supposed to be a dry jump. Everybody had a heavy

17:04.236 --> 17:05.378
load. So you jump in a rice paddy full of water. It's 
memorable. Bend one leg behind you. Bend one leg

17:13.227 --> 17:14.950
however you want to bend it. Stick one foot in the 
mud and hope your head's above the water when you

17:15.450 --> 17:19.315
stand up. And then you walk back. You see, we would 
ride out. The aircraft threw us off. They left. You

17:25.761 --> 17:26.502
walk home. Security on the way home from an 
operation like that was fun. They bunched up. They

17:34.333 --> 17:37.898
all climbed in a couple of dump trucks and ride back 
to the compound. No security as we'd know it. But

17:39.681 --> 17:41.323
they said, don't worry, communist not here. We go 
home, eat lunch.

17:45.529 --> 17:50.196
And we finally found the village, the district 
chief found his security problems on the

17:51.104 --> 17:53.587
Vietnamese staff. And he plugged the problem.

17:59.393 --> 18:05.159
But we had rules about that, and we were ordered out 
of the compound when he had anything he had to do.

18:05.700 --> 18:07.562
Since you were advisors, you had to go. If he said, 
you leave now, you go. I'll call you when I want you

18:11.746 --> 18:14.329
back, then call you back. So you were guests. Don't 
forget it. Sometimes we were pushy guests,

18:19.977 --> 18:24.142
sometimes not pushy enough, but you're still 
guests.

18:27.727 --> 18:30.550
There's probably at the village level no typical 
thing. It's just like going to the office to work

18:30.590 --> 18:37.739
and you decide four times this week to go out on a 
two-mile sweep around your town, around your

18:30.590 --> 18:37.739
village. Take about 50 people, pick up and go. Nine 
out of ten times, you see nothing. One time you have

18:44.928 --> 18:47.571
a report that the communists are out there You hope 
you're right because you've been wanting them.

18:51.471 --> 18:54.696
You get out there at the same time and your 
intelligence is better than theirs and you catch a

18:51.471 --> 18:54.696
few. Or they decide to come to town to demonstrate 
to the villagers you can't even protect the

18:55.296 --> 19:02.667
village and they attack your compound. You got 
some of these. We used to laugh and say both our

19:04.390 --> 19:10.399
compounds were in mortar range of each other one 
time. They lived in the woods about two miles from

19:11.861 --> 19:17.389
us and they were generally out there. But by the 
time you could walk out there to get them, they were

19:17.588 --> 19:20.272
gone. You could find food on the table, still warm.

19:26.743 --> 19:29.627
But how do you sneak out there and catch them? Their 
spies were as good as... And they'd come to town and

19:29.667 --> 19:36.298
collect taxes right there. The next morning you go 
downtown, whoever was there said they were in here

19:36.338 --> 19:40.645
last night, they wanted rice. Well, that's what 
they usually wanted. They wanted money. They

19:42.308 --> 19:43.730
wanted something. They may want a few recruits. 
Everybody knew somebody in the other side. May

19:51.375 --> 19:53.037
even have a relative on the other side. So what we 
had to do, and the hard thing was, convince them to

19:53.798 --> 20:01.345
get him to quit being on the other side. Those are 
the difficult things to try to get done. So you

20:06.591 --> 20:12.857
mostly, these regional force, popular forces, 
mostly engaged They engaged one, two, three,

20:13.445 --> 20:18.050
four, five VC trying to sneak in a village. Little 
things. The war is not written about. There were no

20:22.854 --> 20:24.416
thousand man battles. It was your six men, your ten 
men, your twenty men, kill their twenty men or

20:26.458 --> 20:31.443
wound them. A big firefight, you shoot all night 
and the next morning you got one blood trail or you

20:32.244 --> 20:36.749
got nothing. What did you see? I don't know. You 
never saw a thing. were fights from villages when

20:41.660 --> 21:05.355
we got in the way of their infiltration routes 
that's where we put these mobile teams tried to

20:41.660 --> 21:05.355
find where they were sneaking through the woods 
put a mobile team right there in the middle of it

20:41.660 --> 21:05.355
with 25 30 guys block them uh they'd change routes 
if possible we gradually did a lot of things called

20:41.660 --> 21:05.355
rome plows we crushed down, bulldozed out 
thousands and thousands and thousands of trees

21:07.158 --> 21:13.824
per mile, cleared fields of fire. But you could, no 
matter what you did equipment-wise, until you

21:15.906 --> 21:25.735
convinced the villager it was their war, get off 
the fence, you weren't going to do anything. At

21:27.436 --> 21:33.662
least where I looked at and was, I think we could 
have won the war in the villages. I think locally we

21:34.683 --> 21:37.165
held it quite well for quite a while. But we didn't 
commit our assets as a country to that. We were out

21:41.608 --> 21:44.492
fighting the big war, which wasn't the real war at 
all. The real war was in each village because South

21:44.552 --> 21:51.763
Vietnam is not a country, was not a country. About 
the only thing everybody could tell you who was was

21:51.783 --> 21:54.647
Ho Chi Minh. They could tell you, they could point 
to Hanoi. You say point to Saigon, it's like

21:57.311 --> 22:04.401
turning off the magnet, point on a compass, and 
just letting it freewheel. There wasn't any.

22:05.763 --> 22:08.046
Loyalty in Vietnam was family, in Hamlet. We never 
did quite grasp that at the high level. I think the

22:13.266 --> 22:16.490
people at the bottom in the advisory program, a lot 
of them saw that. It's selling it to the people at

22:17.191 --> 22:20.154
the top. That's the hard part. Were you ever 
involved in anything like the Phoenix Project? I

22:27.483 --> 22:33.831
worked in Phoenix in and out for the 18 months that I 
was in the advisory program. Normally in Phoenix

22:34.840 --> 22:45.456
you ran, these were the people that ran the 
province intelligence centers, the PEOC was the

22:34.840 --> 22:45.456
province, DIOC was district. You would have that 
job as an additional job. You were assigned to the

22:47.740 --> 22:51.345
team and your job was an intelligence specialist. 
You also drew jobs that you did not tell your boss

22:51.906 --> 22:58.656
you were conducting. If they wanted to know why you 
were gone for three days, you just ate the cake. You

23:04.456 --> 23:08.441
couldn't say, sir, I was doing something. It was 
just, I thought I had something to do in the woods,

23:10.162 --> 23:19.954
and we sat there and waited on somebody to come, and 
we waited, and we waited, and we waited, and nobody

23:10.162 --> 23:19.954
came, no matter if you were there or not. But... 
That was an extremely killer spot. Well, yeah, the

23:26.541 --> 23:29.164
whole thing is, And the whole thing really, a 
simple sentence about it would be, Phoenix was

23:29.752 --> 23:36.879
designed to neutralize the shadow government. 
And I think the records show we probably

23:38.761 --> 23:47.749
neutralized about 17,000 of them, 18,000.

23:48.730 --> 23:50.311
Phoenix also may have gotten out of hand. Like 
anything you can't see, how do you regulate it?

23:57.899 --> 23:59.320
The bosses never said kill. It was always 
neutralized. Ours, they use the other term,

24:03.423 --> 24:07.767
rendered militarily ineffective. That's 30% of 
the targets destroyed. Your head counted for 10,

24:10.170 --> 24:12.372
your arms counted for 10. That's one head, both 
arms, that's 30%.

24:19.580 --> 24:22.683
Don't reduce a lot of things to writing. These were 
done face-to-face. Go do orders. Come back, tell

24:26.347 --> 24:27.969
me yes or no. End of End of question. So you didn't 
have... Your direct superior wasn't involved? My

24:39.597 --> 24:42.200
superior, in many cases, never knew what 
Phoenix... He knew there was a Phoenix team. We had

24:43.901 --> 24:45.102
reports we did. We ran the stick, the pen, and the 
map for him. When I conducted operations outside

24:48.806 --> 24:58.855
the gate and everybody took their turn conducting 
them, I may be going to tell him, I'm going out and

24:48.806 --> 24:58.855
ambush the trail tonight. If it looks promising, I 
may stay on for tomorrow. Well, you go out there,

25:02.317 --> 25:07.684
you sit down, you let everybody know you're there, 
then you get up and sneak off in the dark. Go do your

25:08.805 --> 25:09.907
Phoenix job. It may take you two days. You come back 
three days from now, and he says, why in the heck

25:12.270 --> 25:16.856
didn't you answer your radio? I was busy. We were 
sitting there watching an ambush. I said, what

25:22.023 --> 25:22.744
happened? Nothing. He gives you the big weenie 
over it, too. A lot of Phoenix officers got fired,

25:28.872 --> 25:34.698
bad efficiency reports. It was a matter you had to 
decide early in that project, and the company

25:36.220 --> 25:44.689
wasn't going to write you a good report saying you 
worked for them. It was just the Army paid us. We

25:48.674 --> 25:52.838
worked for the Central Intelligence Agency.

25:53.847 --> 26:04.720
either one or two levels of military bosses above 
us, but the ultimate guy in each province was some

25:53.847 --> 26:04.720
kind of an agent, whoever the company sent over 
there, Mr. Smith and Mr. Jones. Did you receive any

26:04.740 --> 26:07.663
special training from them? Not particularly. 
Everybody that basically got in there wanted in.

26:14.431 --> 26:16.353
They didn't draft a lot of reluctant people. 
Should like to do something exciting, really

26:17.374 --> 26:21.559
wonderful, you know. Did they approach you about 
it? Well, it's kind of like some of your friends

26:26.331 --> 26:32.738
that are in said, gosh, we got something you ought 
to like. It's kind of recruitment from within. The

26:36.221 --> 26:42.948
people within that know you or knew you, somebody 
knew you said, hey, I understand he's down here.

26:44.910 --> 26:48.474
Can we find something? And if they offered you 
something that's more exciting than sitting at a

26:48.494 --> 26:52.238
desk or going out and Counting troops.

26:57.685 --> 27:01.932
You're not going to stand up and get your parade, 
but you can go out and do something. Let's go what

27:01.952 --> 27:04.617
we're waiting on. And this was one of the things 
that I think made it interesting. There was some

27:08.384 --> 27:12.271
danger in it, sure.

27:12.291 --> 27:13.954
But a lot of excitement in it. How did they know how 
you were going to react in that situation?

27:21.496 --> 27:25.662
You never knew that, but I mean, it's just saying 
that, well, you've done your other job somewhere

27:21.496 --> 27:25.662
else. You've been in the woods. We believe that, 
and they were always short people. In fact, one of

27:32.152 --> 27:35.678
the problems they had was nobody wanted to go to the 
advisory half. A lot of it was hard to get people

27:35.698 --> 27:40.345
over there, hard to keep them. And if there was a guy 
or two that came along that wanted to go do

27:40.365 --> 27:45.192
something a little off the wall, well, leave them 
alone.

27:48.007 --> 27:54.276
As long as they got done what they wanted done, they 
really didn't care what you did the other 30

27:48.007 --> 27:54.276
minutes using the woods. You did their job in 30 and 
you took an hour to come back at your business. You

27:58.623 --> 27:59.845
went sightseeing for 30 minutes. Don't be stupid. 
But it was a trade. Somebody said, we think that.

28:10.881 --> 28:14.667
Then don't mess up because you put your name on it 
too. You vouch for me. I go out there and I'm the

28:15.528 --> 28:17.271
clown klutz. then you get a problem.

28:22.494 --> 28:25.857
But it was a different challenge. It was something 
that I think was approached and sold somewhat, a

28:25.937 --> 28:31.182
friend, you can make a difference. And I think most 
of the guys that got it believed it, at least at the

28:33.585 --> 28:39.871
start. And I think one of the problems with any 
program of the type is you can't come out and

28:39.891 --> 28:47.578
explain how you're doing it. and by not explaining 
it the commander said you intel types can't find

28:49.533 --> 29:17.903
you know where with both hands holding on to it you 
can't find it look in the mirror you know and and you

28:49.533 --> 29:17.903
bagged it there was some notoriety and there were 
some some guys that really caused problems in the

28:49.533 --> 29:17.903
program but uh the program i think to a large extent 
worked it's the problem with any of those

28:49.533 --> 29:17.903
operations of that type how do you measure success 
Everybody remembers the one failure. You know,

29:20.067 --> 29:23.994
you go out and you miss the target. You go out and bag 
the guy. You can't have a parade down Fifth Avenue

29:25.296 --> 29:28.260
for you. You got him. Only satisfaction you get was 
you know you got him. You and the other three guys in

29:37.575 --> 29:40.680
the woods, the four guys, the five guys. And you may 
not know you got him. The boat comes by, you shoot

29:44.883 --> 29:49.402
everybody in the boat because the guy's supposed 
to be in the boat, and you come home. You go back to

29:50.466 --> 29:53.880
the team house, think we got him. You have to wait 
until the other side, maybe a year later, two years

29:55.210 --> 29:59.515
later, three years later. You capture a document 
that says, two years ago at 2 a.m. in the morning, we

29:59.935 --> 30:08.085
lost these three guys who were shot out of the boat, 
and they name them. By then, you've rotated home.

30:11.488 --> 30:17.235
Somebody may tell you one day that was in the 
business later than you were, come by and say, hey,

30:11.488 --> 30:17.235
by the way, you did get him. It's not like the 
infantry commander. You get the other side, you

30:21.308 --> 30:28.398
walk out, and you have your picture made there with 
8,000 of them stacked up. We didn't want them

30:28.418 --> 30:29.620
stacked up. I just went and got one. Did you, these 
three and four-man, five-man teams, were they

30:34.227 --> 30:43.100
Vietnamese joint? No. We normally ran, when 
Phoenix worked, it ran all U.S. personnel. other

30:51.117 --> 31:19.774
words i want you to go somewhere and do something 
you may have had a vietnamese security force that

30:51.117 --> 31:19.774
stayed somewhere with one of the americans the 
other four you detached yourselves took off went

30:51.117 --> 31:19.774
and did what you were going to do and come back 
normally do not work joint operations in fact most

30:51.117 --> 31:19.774
of the ones we worked weren't joint because we were 
doing something they weren't going to do or

30:51.117 --> 31:19.774
couldn't do or somebody might said wouldn't do but 
it was Did you have any type of... I guess you had to

31:24.841 --> 31:36.439
be

31:24.841 --> 31:36.439
completely... had no identifying... Well, you 
didn't sign your name Kilroy was here. You

31:36.479 --> 31:44.712
tried to make sure you left as few clues as possible 
in the woods. You were tidy. Don't go out there and

31:46.214 --> 31:48.478
play cards and eat lunch. If you ate, you ate their 
food. I mean, you know, most of the stuff that I got

31:50.336 --> 32:00.647
in on that way were go out, wait on something, do 
something, come back.

32:02.188 --> 32:04.851
Where possible, you tried to disguise it as a 
communist act. And there were ways of doing that.

32:08.795 --> 32:12.299
But give the other side credit for doing 
something. They did it. And if it turned out they

32:13.660 --> 32:18.465
did it and it was one of their own, well, I guess he 
was disloyal. Let them get the

32:20.656 --> 32:42.258
credit.

32:42.278 --> 32:49.245
Did you feel like that the Phoenix project 
accomplished the objectives that you were out to?

32:50.035 --> 32:57.762
The only part any of us had there then was your local 
picture. In other words, you got province-wide,

32:58.783 --> 33:05.670
corps-wide over briefings.

33:08.933 --> 33:11.195
If you asked to, I think it accomplished an 
objective. We removed enemy agents,

33:11.255 --> 33:17.781
plugged leaks. tried to disrupt the shadow 
government it wasn't complete you couldn't find

33:20.225 --> 33:48.645
all of them there's a lot of people i would like to 
have met at least once uh i think at the the level we

33:20.225 --> 33:48.645
were working at we at least kept their government 
from growing it was kind of the uh well it's like

33:20.225 --> 33:48.645
fighting fire ants You kill a mound, and another 
mound shows up, and you go after it, and another

33:50.380 --> 33:57.472
mound shows up, and you dose the next mound. I think 
we held them in check. The Vietnamese had to be the

34:01.739 --> 34:04.764
ones who decided. They now felt successful 
enough, brave enough, bold enough then to then

34:06.507 --> 34:14.601
mount the operation and go get them. And we got a lot 
of that where I was. Because we helped equip them.

34:18.289 --> 34:20.253
In other words, Americans helped the Vietnamese. 
We got them equipment. We got them boots. We got

34:23.077 --> 34:24.159
them our rifles. We made them look like us. In other 
words, instead of having 25 rifles, you had one.

34:32.913 --> 34:36.499
But you had to make them come around. It was their 
war, not yours. You were merely there as the

34:40.025 --> 34:41.908
advisor. Then you can say, yes, we won. When the 
district started doing what it should have been

34:44.802 --> 34:53.215
doing by our guess of what a war ought to be, we were 
then happy, yeah, we're succeeding here. You had

34:55.879 --> 34:56.520
those. You had the failures. But on hold, I think 
where we were, we succeeded.

35:05.635 --> 35:11.704
After I left, I was told they brought American 
units in and cleared an area that we didn't have the

35:05.635 --> 35:11.704
manpower to clear or the equipment. But I'm saying 
it was an area that we knew was a problem area that

35:12.697 --> 35:21.748
what it amounted to was if you had a 30,000-acre 
preserve you can cross and nobody can see through,

35:12.697 --> 35:21.748
there's nothing we can do about it. So we came in and 
bowdozed it out clean. Once it was clear, you can

35:25.693 --> 35:29.878
look out there for three miles, four miles, 
nothing going on. But that's where the heavy

35:31.741 --> 35:36.607
equipment the Americans had would come in. The 
village areas, I think we helped the villagers

35:36.867 --> 35:40.712
there to help themselves. I think that part was 
successful. I think Phoenix

35:45.126 --> 35:54.676
was fairly successful even though I'm not sure in 
the end how you measure success. I don't think you

35:54.896 --> 35:58.200
do it in number of targets neutralized. I think it 
may be measured the best way in was what did the

35:59.801 --> 36:08.050
Vietnamese government, their people feel that 
they were doing. Ours became, our advisees became

36:09.802 --> 36:17.875
more capable of doing their own war. I think that's 
a success measure. I think the villages we were in

36:21.921 --> 36:24.606
became proficient. What we did was give them that 
gentle nudge and once in a while show off when you

36:26.609 --> 36:37.446
had to, but you did not want to go out and do these 
things because if you were ever caught doing them,

36:26.609 --> 36:37.446
you're through. The unwritten rules of the thing 
are coming apart. The adequate breach of... They

36:44.734 --> 36:50.622
didn't realize you had absolutely no trust in them 
to slip out there and do this. Oh, you didn't

36:52.885 --> 36:55.369
want... We never told the Vietnamese. Oh, the 
Vietnamese never knew who did it. No. You see, when

37:00.095 --> 37:05.443
the Americans performed as Americans, that's 
what it was. Just the job was done.

37:09.775 --> 37:13.882
Another case of communist terrorist. Maybe his 
bomb went off before he got the planet. You didn't

37:19.110 --> 37:21.815
hang a sign on anybody's desk saying, we did it. Let 
them sort it out. They may know, but they were more

37:26.001 --> 37:35.597
polite than walk up and say, did you Americans that 
were missing from the compound for two days go and

37:26.001 --> 37:35.597
do something? Because your boss is already 
hollering at you in front of all of them about why

37:36.050 --> 37:41.679
didn't you answer what was going on. Well, boss, we 
were sitting in the woods looking at something. We

37:44.223 --> 37:45.145
thought it was nice. And while you guys are in the 
woods on vacation sitting on your butts, we're

37:46.467 --> 37:51.956
back here overworked and undermanned. Yeah, I 
guess that's how it is. And you ate it. Did that have

37:56.443 --> 37:58.767
a negative effect on you? Oh, yeah. It had a 
negative effect on you. On your record, too? Yeah.

38:02.695 --> 38:06.561
If you didn't want it cleaned or couldn't get it 
cleaned, how are you going to clean it? The guy that

38:07.622 --> 38:09.946
sent you to do something didn't put it in writing. 
He wasn't going to write you a report card and say

38:10.387 --> 38:12.951
thank you. Your thanks was you got to do it.

38:18.499 --> 38:24.408
And that was the problem with part of it. You can't 
stand up and have the parade because then you've

38:24.428 --> 38:28.214
lost the effectiveness. But if you don't have the 
other proof... your boss says how come didn't you

38:31.180 --> 38:54.083
perform as well as i hoped you just stand there and 
say well gosh boss i guess i'm not what you expected

38:31.180 --> 38:54.083
and yeah it was uh it had some negative performance

38:31.180 --> 38:54.083
it's how to get kicked and stand there uh you 
mentioned a while ago that uh

38:57.623 --> 38:59.886
Sometimes the program was taken advantage of. In 
what way? Well, if you were out doing something,

39:01.007 --> 39:11.139
nobody

39:01.007 --> 39:11.139
was really going to ask you what else might you be 
doing.

39:14.443 --> 39:19.629
If I went in and I bagged whoever I went after, I 
picked up whatever I was sent to do. If on the way out

39:19.649 --> 39:27.158
you picked up some spare change in your own pocket, 
there wasn't anybody left that was going to say he

39:19.649 --> 39:27.158
took it there were people in there that they took 
advantage of it but eventually it leaks because

39:29.112 --> 39:53.314
you're no longer conducting yourself as if you've 
got money you've got something and usually it came

39:29.112 --> 39:53.314
out very quickly particularly when you're 
talking about five guys that supposedly haven't

39:29.112 --> 39:53.314
been anywhere living in the woods all of a sudden 
act like they're uptown that uh Most of it, a lot of

39:54.712 --> 39:58.436
it, some of them took advantage of the time. They 
simply went out to do a job that wasn't going to get

39:58.456 --> 40:00.839
done. Instead of doing it one day and coming back, 
you stayed a week. What are you going to do to them?

40:05.624 --> 40:05.984
Fire them? You're just out there doing a job. You 
weren't watched when you did these things. In

40:12.911 --> 40:18.618
Vietnam, the advisors weren't watched all the 
time unless you want to call the Vietnamese seeing

40:12.911 --> 40:18.618
you drive around being watched. You have your 
jeep. Where is it going? Gosh, I don't know. How

40:25.137 --> 40:26.258
long is he going to be gone? I haven't got any idea. 
When's he coming back when you see him next? And

40:30.223 --> 40:32.725
that was the most of the goof off. There were a few 
that did other things, but I'm saying that was the

40:32.745 --> 40:37.190
big one. Some got caught picking up property that 
wasn't theirs. Dumb.

40:44.599 --> 40:52.107
It's been said that

40:44.599 --> 40:52.107
the project was used as a way for... uh people to get 
revenge on one another oh if the vietnamese wanted

40:52.593 --> 41:19.815
you dead it was simple

40:52.593 --> 41:19.815
supply the information to the system the 
vietnamese at the province level had a committee

40:52.593 --> 41:19.815
that met they made the selections on the 
system-wide ones as the Who should Phoenix go

41:21.179 --> 41:22.841
after next? Took a vote on it. They supposedly had 
hard evidence. In other words, they had agent

41:29.587 --> 41:35.113
reports, sworn statements, police sightings 
that you are a commie. If they didn't like you, just

41:37.655 --> 41:45.163
have that same policeman who's your 
brother-in-law swear that you're no good. The

41:46.864 --> 41:48.486
system will then go get you. And there was 
problems. Their standards of conduct might not

41:52.496 --> 41:55.060
have been what we wanted. But you had no way of 
knowing because you weren't asked when you were

41:57.323 --> 42:04.412
assigned a task why it's been assigned. You were 
told the committee has voted to proceed with the

42:04.973 --> 42:08.738
operation. If you didn't want to proceed with the 
operation, resign. Do

42:11.182 --> 42:19.553
you think there was instances where the Viet Cong 
or Vietnamese whoever fed you with false

42:21.406 --> 42:50.569
information so that you would select the target 
that they wanted neutralized I'm sure without

42:21.406 --> 42:50.569
saying I have any proof I don't have any because you 
never saw when you worked in the field the answer to

42:21.406 --> 42:50.569
that question it's always possible whether it's 
probable

42:21.406 --> 42:50.569
you know I don't probably have somewhere had no no 
proof and no idea of it. Was there, what were the

42:55.079 --> 43:02.727
prevalent operational problems that you 
encountered? I mean, I'll give you an example of

43:02.747 --> 43:05.770
what I'm after. You may have not noticed it so much 
when you were with MACB, but perhaps more when you

43:05.790 --> 43:20.286
were, but such things as

43:05.790 --> 43:20.286
the morale problems or drug problems or language 
problems? I think the biggest problems that way in

43:21.903 --> 43:31.431
67, if you want to go back to that one, pick up 
I-Corps with American units, there wasn't a drug

43:21.903 --> 43:31.431
problem as such in the field. The troops in the 
field were fairly straight. Anybody that was fool

43:37.577 --> 43:42.621
enough to shoot up out there probably came home in a 
body bag. You just sat there when the firefight

43:45.063 --> 43:50.408
started and anything that was standing up went 
down. The drug problem was probably in the base

43:50.843 --> 43:56.450
camps. Too many hours of sitting on your butt doing 
nothing but sitting on your butt. And when you got

44:03.619 --> 44:06.022
off work, nowhere to go and nothing to do. And 
particularly, I think, the longer it went toward

44:08.345 --> 44:13.071
the end of the war, and I will say that is reading 
reports and speculation afterwards was, I think,

44:14.485 --> 44:19.210
probably the worst guy. When it became apparent 
you weren't going to win and let's get out, then I

44:19.231 --> 44:30.343
think the problem was who wants to be the last guy to 
die in Vietnam became relevant. Not me, sir. Where

44:32.986 --> 44:39.514
I worked, and remember, when you're talking about 
the intelligence people, you're talking about

44:32.986 --> 44:39.514
the hand-picked crews.

44:42.093 --> 44:51.387
And if you say other than alcohol, drinking, that 
type of an abuse, and I believe alcohol is a drug,

44:42.093 --> 44:51.387
that would be the drug abuse question. A lot of them 
drank. There weren't a lot, if you're heading for

44:55.113 --> 44:58.438
the question, were there a lot of dopers? The 
answer is no.

45:02.024 --> 45:04.708
But remember, we didn't take people with an IQ of 80 
either. You know, you wanted 100 plus, 125 that you

45:06.427 --> 45:09.971
could find them. One of the things the 
intelligence unit did, they had people who went

45:10.492 --> 45:21.584
through the records from the people processed in 
who would call you if somebody came through with a

45:10.492 --> 45:21.584
master's or a PhD, an enlisted man who didn't want 
to be an officer. We always had use for another

45:21.944 --> 45:23.806
brain. We didn't get the scum or the riffraff of 
America who, instead of going to the TDC for the

45:31.908 --> 45:36.835
Texas example, enlisted for six years. Those kind 
were there, I'm sure, but we didn't see them. When I

45:43.044 --> 45:48.692
went to the woods, I was with a unit that was on 
operation, and there truly wasn't a drug problem.

45:49.233 --> 45:59.628
Now, as far as morale goes, and asking that 
question, you know, well, anti-war, pro-war, you

45:49.233 --> 45:59.628
had all of it. Mm-hmm. uh there were units that i 
visited that had

46:00.275 --> 46:26.940
some problems motivating the troops use a nice 
army word for get them off their butt lieutenant

46:00.275 --> 46:26.940
and get them going but that wasn't the problem that 
we see portrayed later where everybody in the unit

46:00.275 --> 46:26.940
did drugs i didn't see those oh I guess from an 
intelligence standpoint, I would think that the

46:29.114 --> 46:38.325
language barrier would have been a problem as far 
as operations. The language barrier only becomes

46:38.505 --> 46:53.303
a problem when you're with the Vietnamese

46:38.505 --> 46:53.303
walking through a town trying to talk to people, if 
you want to call it civilian street talk. Two

46:53.463 --> 46:57.568
armored units engaged on the field of combat 
language barrier is no problem at all. I mean, I'm

46:58.122 --> 47:02.028
shooting at you, you're shooting at me, and one of 
us surrenders. Then you encounter the problems.

47:06.174 --> 47:13.244
But the American unit, and say something about 
Americans, and I think this is one of the problems

47:06.174 --> 47:13.244
that we had. The great picture of Vietnam was this 
mass of battles fought in jungles and other

47:14.486 --> 47:22.577
strange, exotic things like that. Vietnam looked 
as much like Texas as anywhere you go. Open

47:25.902 --> 47:28.045
countryside, rolling hills. We had the jungles, 
we had the mountains. We had both in I-Corps.

47:35.850 --> 47:41.826
In III Corps you had jungles and some more 
mountains, but it was much warmer, more tropical.

47:41.846 --> 47:44.413
The Americans that went, they were isolated.
