00:01.094 --> 00:12.511
Rodriguez on December 6, 1989, at 308 McCullough, 
the residence of Mr. Rodriguez, concerning his

00:01.094 --> 00:12.511
life here in Bryan, Texas, and his tenure at Texas 
A&M University. Mr. Rodriguez, in the interest of

00:14.273 --> 00:23.367
accumulating knowledge, I'm asking you to donate 
this tape to me or to the Texas A&M Oral History

00:14.273 --> 00:23.367
Collection in the University Archives. Is that 
all right with you? Yes. This is a future

00:26.031 --> 00:30.257
historians, students, and researchers also can 
listen to it And so you are free to use the

00:30.558 --> 00:34.344
interviewee's statements. To begin, I'd like you 
to relay some biographical information to me,

00:34.364 --> 00:41.254
date of birth, your family history in Bryan, and 
the like. Well, as you mentioned, my name is Pete L.

00:43.016 --> 00:48.364
Rodriguez. I was born in Bryan, Texas in 1915. My 
father, Manuel Rodriguez, was born in Zacatecas,

00:53.251 --> 00:59.080
Mexico in 1869. He arrived in the United States in 
1889, arrived here in Bryan same year. My mother's

01:08.458 --> 01:11.621
maiden name was Clotilde Gondina. She was born in 
Pearsall, Texas in 1880. Her mother was born in

01:15.225 --> 01:19.910
Senton, Texas in 1835. That makes her a native 
Texan. It sure does. Back when I was a child, I

01:25.515 --> 01:28.999
remember my daddy's restaurant. It was a 
combination of a restaurant and saloon business.

01:34.250 --> 01:36.272
It was in downtown Bryan. The only part I can 
remember of that operation is when Dad was closing

01:37.293 --> 01:41.759
it up. I was about three and a half years old.

01:48.226 --> 01:50.829
And it was closed because of prohibition. About 
1918, 1919? Yeah, about that time. After that, Dad

01:56.756 --> 01:59.239
went to work in Goose Creek. as an old Derek hand, I 
guess. But according to Mom, he never left Bryan.

02:07.262 --> 02:10.406
He commuted weekly. So I got to see him at least once 
a week for many years after that, because Daddy did

02:11.648 --> 02:19.018
work for about 10 years. I started school when I was 
seven years old. In those days, we did not have

02:24.586 --> 02:27.910
ghettos here in Bryan. at least not to the extent 
that it affected the Hispanics. There were only a

02:32.284 --> 02:36.811
few Hispanic families in Bryan when I was growing 
up. Would you describe the Hispanic community in

02:39.234 --> 02:42.860
Bryan as it was when you were growing up? 
Basically, what was its relation to the rest of the

02:43.861 --> 02:46.666
community? How many families were there, et 
cetera? Well, we grew up with the rest of the

02:49.450 --> 02:56.260
community, which consisted of I guess Italian 
people, Polish people, Czechoslovakians, and I

02:57.050 --> 03:09.289
guess other nationalities.

03:10.611 --> 03:15.158
And we were accepted as equals by them. You didn't 
feel any tension? None whatsoever. I don't know

03:21.113 --> 03:29.136
why, because later on there was tension, but at 
that time, back when I was growing up, there was no

03:21.113 --> 03:29.136
tension whatsoever. None those early years, 
anyway. At this time, I guess along the same lines,

03:32.466 --> 03:36.237
how did Brian treat his Hispanic citizens? In your 
mind, I guess you've already answered part of

03:37.077 --> 03:46.366
this, but was there any legal, public, or hidden 
discrimination, or even just an air of bad

03:37.077 --> 03:46.366
feelings or anything like that? I wish I could 
answer that, but I can't because I don't know what

03:46.386 --> 03:52.772
was in their mind, but they treated me well. But I 
did notice some discrimination later on in the,

03:53.773 --> 03:59.979
I'd say, latter 30s. I think this change of 
attitude took place when a large influx of

04:06.271 --> 04:28.264
Hispanic

04:06.271 --> 04:28.264
began moving into Bryan during the late 30s, as I 
mentioned before, from nearby towns such as

04:06.271 --> 04:28.264
Cameron, Hearn, Caldwell, Somerville, 
Rockdale, and so forth. And I believe this is when

04:28.284 --> 04:33.171
the school board decided to segregate the school. 
I never did understand why. A school strictly for

04:37.000 --> 04:43.867
Hispanic was established in North Bryan near the 
San Jacinto Loop. It was known then as the Ibarra

04:44.968 --> 04:50.693
School, named after a Mexican Baptist church 
minister. Regardless of what part of Bryan an

04:51.774 --> 04:57.359
Hispanic lived, his children had to attend that 
school. The end result was that the students did

04:59.301 --> 05:05.387
not learn much due to inadequate facilities, and 
they were inadequate, and extra large classes per

05:06.245 --> 05:08.688
teacher. Can you elaborate a little bit on how they 
were inadequate? Was there just not enough? Were

05:13.493 --> 05:15.796
they not using proper text? Were the classes just 
spread out amongst the grades so much? Actually,

05:19.159 --> 05:23.765
the rooms were crowded with students. They only 
had one blackboard, and it wasn't wide enough to

05:23.785 --> 05:29.751
cover from one end to the room to the other. And a 
teacher somehow or other seemed to want squeeze

05:35.675 --> 05:41.060
the material that we think the kids had to learn in 
that small blackboard. And I remember I went to see

05:41.200 --> 05:45.985
this because I had my son there. And I told his 
teacher, I said, you need additional blackboard

05:46.786 --> 05:58.357
so that the kids can go up there and write because 
they can't do this because it's covered with your

05:46.786 --> 05:58.357
material and things such as that. So were these 
white teachers? Yeah, they were all white

06:01.480 --> 06:02.781
teachers. Yeah, they were white teachers. But 
they were kind. They appeared to be kind. I think

06:10.937 --> 06:16.042
they were doing the best they could under the 
circumstances. But I could tell that they didn't

06:16.983 --> 06:21.408
care about being there. I think that they felt that 
they were recognized as inferior teachers by the

06:21.428 --> 06:31.078
fact of being sent over to the Yvonne School. You 
didn't grow up in this system. You went to Bryan

06:33.692 --> 06:36.015
High School. That's right. Can you contrast how 
you think you were educated to this? In those

06:41.222 --> 06:44.425
schools, there was a lot of room. It was not 
crowded. You had blackboards all around the room

06:47.169 --> 06:53.877
when the teacher would tell us We've got a problem. 
I want all of you to go to the black room, the

06:54.964 --> 06:57.509
blackboard. We'd all go to the blackboard and we'd 
do whatever she wanted us to do. And not only that,

07:03.822 --> 07:09.874
we'd have different teachers for different 
subjects. While here at the Morrow School, that

07:10.377 --> 07:14.703
one teacher taught every subject. She taught 
arithmetic, spelling, and geography, and

07:14.763 --> 07:18.909
history, and everything else. And you know 
yourself that she probably was good in one area,

07:19.430 --> 07:24.377
but not that good in the rest of them. And I know 
this, you could see this, because this later was

07:24.397 --> 07:34.512
reflected in the students when they attended high 
school. They all flunked. I mean, they never

07:35.884 --> 07:37.486
finished high school. So after like nine years of 
bar schooling, it went on. That's right. And they

07:41.370 --> 07:45.074
felt inferior. The kids did. They felt that they 
were not wanted. And they did not feel equal to the

07:50.420 --> 07:58.089
other kids there when they got to high school or 
when they were in high school. They would hang

07:58.109 --> 08:03.655
around with themselves, with the rest of the 
Hispanics. And they'd play with each other. They

08:06.361 --> 08:09.107
would not play with the Anglos. I guess they felt 
that they weren't wanted. And so, as a

08:14.418 --> 08:17.825
consequence, they just didn't do well. And they 
just dropped out. What about the language, too?

08:21.592 --> 08:22.795
That's another thing. They never learned the 
English language well. They needed to mingle with

08:26.146 --> 08:28.009
Anglo kids. So be immersed in it. That's right. And 
they did not do that. They just mingled with

08:31.393 --> 08:33.536
themselves. And so when they were with 
themselves, they spoke nothing but Spanish.

08:37.982 --> 08:38.623
Nothing wrong with that. But still, they had to 
learn the English language. I see. Do you know how

08:42.168 --> 08:45.513
long the Bar School was operating? I think the Bar 
School lasted about 10 years, approximately 10

08:45.693 --> 08:50.119
years. OK. How did the Bryan public school system 
actually become desegregated, and how are you

08:53.399 --> 08:58.887
involved in this? Well, you know, in 1939, World 
War II got started, and everything was focused

08:58.987 --> 09:10.062
towards the war. I mean, somehow or other, people 
were excited, and war was the primary concern. And

09:17.598 --> 09:22.883
the schools were not in the forefront like they are 
today. They were thinking about war. Of course, I

09:26.466 --> 09:32.071
went overseas, and a lot of the parents of these 
kids went overseas. And we left things like they

09:32.531 --> 09:35.154
were in those schools. But then when we came back, 
we found out what was happening to these kids. You

09:41.920 --> 09:43.401
and some other veterans? That's right, me and some 
other veterans. Actually, I got it started.

09:47.905 --> 09:56.657
Actually, I decided to get a group of people whose 
children were going to that school, and I know they

09:47.905 --> 09:56.657
didn't like it, and I asked them. I had a meeting 
with them. I don't know if they would go before the

09:57.758 --> 10:05.328
school board with me and complain about the 
school, and they say they were more than ready to

09:57.758 --> 10:05.328
go. And so I went and met with one of the board 
members, and told him what I had in mind. He agreed

10:14.535 --> 10:16.739
it was all right for his concern. What exactly did 
you have in mind? Beg your pardon? What exactly did

10:19.244 --> 10:20.567
you have in mind? To get rid of the school, to 
desegregate the school, to permit these children

10:20.587 --> 10:30.505
to go to another school other than Ibarra, to get 
rid of Ibarra. And so then I asked him if to give me

10:34.143 --> 10:41.053
the names of the board members, because since I 
just got back from overseas, I didn't know the

10:34.143 --> 10:41.053
names of these board members. And he did, and some 
of them I knew, and some of those board members, I

10:41.073 --> 10:51.448
knew them because I went to school with some of 
their children. And so, actually, I knew Mr. Webb

10:51.468 --> 11:00.842
Howell, whose dad did business with him at one time 
or another. And so he was the president and

11:01.463 --> 11:04.366
chairman of the board. And I went to see him at his 
office. And he said, definitely, I'll call a

11:06.769 --> 11:09.833
meeting for you. So he gave us a meeting. It was on a 
Tuesday night. I think we met, if I'm not mistaken,

11:12.716 --> 11:18.483
at the old Bryan High School. And we met there on the 
third floor. And the superintendent was there.

11:27.417 --> 11:34.246
I asked some of the members that went with me, some 
of these people that are going to help me try to get

11:27.417 --> 11:34.246
rid of the school. I asked them questions to the 
president and the board members why they want to

11:35.687 --> 11:39.632
get rid of the school. One of them would get up and 
say, well, my wife is taking my son all the way to

11:39.673 --> 11:45.600
Huntsville every morning. Drop him off in the 
afternoon, go pick him up. And then two others say,

11:49.885 --> 11:54.391
well, mine is going with another group to 
Navasota. And we are doing the same thing. And then

11:57.320 --> 11:59.203
I said, well, take me, for instance. I've got my 
children, and they're consolidated. And so NM

12:02.228 --> 12:05.473
Consolidated wasn't a problem. Big part? They 
were not. No, they were not segregated.

12:08.858 --> 12:09.880
Absolutely not. And so they were, actually, they 
were surprised to hear this. I don't think they

12:15.328 --> 12:20.256
were aware, Peter, that this was going on. These 
sacrifices were being made by these parents to get

12:20.978 --> 12:36.093
a better education for their children by taking 
them out of town because they knew that they were

12:20.978 --> 12:36.093
not getting the kind of education that other kids 
were getting in the other schools here at Ibarra.

12:37.254 --> 12:41.358
And so they were very receptive to what we had to 
say. And Mr. Webb Howell thanked us for bringing

12:41.799 --> 12:47.965
this to his attention and to their attention. And I 
think they all in unison said that we were going to

12:48.620 --> 12:52.845
get rid of that school immediately. And sure 
enough, within two months, it was gone. Two

12:55.489 --> 12:55.869
months? Within two months, it was gone. And so the 
kids were sent to these other schools, to go to the

12:58.452 --> 13:03.919
school of their choice. And accommodations were 
made to accommodate them. And they were very

13:09.406 --> 13:12.370
gladly accepted by the teachers. The teachers 
seemed to be glad to have them there. And so that

13:15.194 --> 13:17.817
ended that school. It left the mark on these kids 
that attended Ibarra because they never did get

13:18.657 --> 13:34.077
rid of this feeling of inferiority that they 
developed by going there. And they never did

13:34.097 --> 13:36.680
finish high school. I'd say that 20% of the kids 
that went to Ibarra finished high school. The rest

13:42.447 --> 13:43.348
of them did not. And that was because of that 
school. And I can see this today. I can see a lot of my

13:48.557 --> 13:56.767
friends' children, a lot of my friends will 
complain about how this affects their children.

13:57.167 --> 13:59.790
They say, my boy didn't go to college on account of 
that. My boy didn't advance on account of that. And

14:03.274 --> 14:12.205
I remember at one time I was talking to the 
principal of the boys' school, who was also

14:03.274 --> 14:12.205
principal of that school, And he knew that I had 
went before the board, and he didn't like it. And I

14:18.011 --> 14:20.874
told him, I said, look, these kids need a better 
education. They want to advance you like all the

14:20.914 --> 14:24.317
other kids. And the response he gave me was that, he 
said, someone has to take the ditches. And of

14:30.484 --> 14:35.769
course, I didn't expect that from an educator, but 
that's what he said. And I think, that's right, I

14:35.990 --> 14:38.833
remember that. He told me that on the school 
ground. But you can see why, from that attitude of

14:42.087 --> 14:51.016
this principal, why the school board didn't know 
that this school's having this effect on these

14:42.087 --> 14:51.016
kids. And so I was very appreciative of the group 
that went with me, because they helped a lot. And

15:00.105 --> 15:06.231
actually, they're ultimately responsible for 
getting rid of this segregated school. Can you

15:08.333 --> 15:12.077
compare the Ibarra school the treatment of 
Hispanics and education in Bryan public school

15:12.378 --> 15:17.544
system to that of blacks? What do you know about the 
black education or community at this time? Well, I

15:21.709 --> 15:24.492
don't know too much about black education. The 
only thing I do know is that the blacks had black

15:26.275 --> 15:33.964
teachers, whereby the Hispanics had white 
teachers. And the blacks The schools were in their

15:41.167 --> 15:59.285
ghettos

15:41.167 --> 15:59.285
near them, and I guess it was convenient for them 
because it was there, it was close, it was nearby,

15:41.167 --> 15:59.285
but still it was a segregated school. I never heard 
of a white going there to teach them or anything

16:00.906 --> 16:08.794
like that.

16:10.799 --> 16:38.697
I know that,

16:10.799 --> 16:38.697
I know this to be a fact that at times when our school 
started, when school started, we were issued new

16:10.799 --> 16:38.697
books, all of us were issued new books, and the 
books that were used the previous year or were old,

16:10.799 --> 16:38.697
they put them all in boxes and they were taken over 
to the Black schools. So they never did get new

16:40.663 --> 16:42.125
books. They only got old books. They got books that 
we had already used up. And they were always

16:46.310 --> 16:47.932
separate, is that right? They were always 
separate, right. They were always separate. And

16:51.957 --> 16:57.483
they were just discriminated against. And they 
were always segregated. I don't know what else to

16:59.285 --> 17:00.947
say. I mean,

17:01.047 --> 17:07.755
they had their own football stadium. They played 
with each other. They could not, actually, their

17:10.411 --> 17:18.559
high school football team could never play 
without a football team against ours. Yet they had

17:18.619 --> 17:21.562
a big stadium over there. And actually, sometimes 
they had more people going to their games than we

17:21.582 --> 17:29.390
had white people going to ours, because there are a 
lot of blacks here. But it was, I mean, I enjoyed

17:31.973 --> 17:35.457
going to their games. As long as you paid, you could 
go to their games. But they couldn't go to our

17:38.330 --> 17:41.574
games. Even if they paid, they couldn't go. Some of 
them would mingle in and stand up by the fence and

17:44.277 --> 17:51.525
kind of sit there. But that's the extent of their 
participation in our football. But that's the way

17:56.771 --> 17:58.893
it was in those days. What about publicly in Bryan? 
They were disallowed from public facilities or

18:01.856 --> 18:07.122
had separate public facilities? Your public 
places had separate facilities. All your

18:14.138 --> 18:16.420
doctor's offices had separate facilities. And 
the hospitals had separate facilities and

18:17.441 --> 18:22.405
separate rooms for blacks. And

18:22.685 --> 18:35.577
you could notice that in the hospital, that all of 
the activity was on the end of the whites and hardly

18:22.685 --> 18:35.577
nothing on the end. I remember when you were in 
Europe, If your daddy was born, I could see a lot of

18:37.274 --> 18:42.979
activity there in the hospital. But on the black 
side, there was only two rooms, I think. It was kind

18:48.644 --> 18:52.167
of semi-dark and nothing going on. Every now and 
then you'd see a nurse go in there and come back out.

18:56.471 --> 18:58.793
There just wasn't any place where the blacks could 
sit. They had to either wait on the outside or in the

18:58.913 --> 19:06.640
hallway right directly in front of the room where 
the patient was. But we, on the white side, had

19:07.042 --> 19:10.888
seats and everything. So they didn't have the 
conveniences that we did. And I think that was, to

19:16.836 --> 19:21.684
me, it was unjustly. Were the hospital facilities 
always open to Hispanics, too? Yeah, always.

19:28.414 --> 19:29.695
Definitely, yeah. There was some sporadic 
discrimination. I don't know. They tell me that it

19:36.674 --> 19:41.362
came in the form of preference, in other words. And 
I think that they would readily treat an Anglo

19:41.382 --> 19:52.080
quicker than they would an Hispanic. And usually, 
because we only had two hospitals in Bryan, lots of

19:52.100 --> 20:02.277
time is overcrowded.

20:02.881 --> 20:10.289
If an Hispanic would go sick and need a room, they'd 
make sure that the Anglos were taken care of first

20:02.881 --> 20:10.289
before the Hispanic. They never told you this, and 
nobody knew it, not even the Anglos, but the

20:11.030 --> 20:16.176
Hispanic. The Hispanic knew it because it 
affected them. I know that. It happened to the

20:21.602 --> 20:26.087
people that I know. They could see an empty room 
when they were there, but then a little bit, it

20:26.978 --> 20:34.149
wasn't empty anymore, and the Spaniard, Angler 
was in there, or whatever. And he would be sent back

20:35.351 --> 20:40.840
home and say, well, come back tomorrow, maybe we 
can get you in the hospital. You know, that's the

20:41.221 --> 20:42.162
way it was. We've already talked about public 
schools and Brian and how Hispanics fit in, what

20:43.504 --> 20:49.093
they had to do. What about A&M? What were the 
opportunities for Hispanic students at A&M? And

20:53.050 --> 20:55.152
were there really any there from the community? 
Well, actually, I think that A&M always had its

20:55.193 --> 21:05.505
doors open for, I say, Latin people. I'm going to 
use that term right now, because there were a lot of

21:05.565 --> 21:14.275
Latin people, a lot of Latin students there from 
Mexico, from South America. And there was some

21:15.777 --> 21:20.442
discrimination. there, but not much. I think it's 
mostly a language barrier because those people

21:22.940 --> 21:31.734
from Mexico, the students from Mexico could not 
communicate very well. And so that's the only

21:31.834 --> 21:39.306
thing I could see is that they just could not 
communicate. But I never did see why Latin from

21:40.167 --> 21:46.497
those foreign countries was mistreated. And I 
don't recall that any Hispanics from this country

21:47.320 --> 21:53.628
were mistreated because there were hardly any. I 
mean, between you and me, I just hardly ever saw

21:53.648 --> 21:58.755
Hispanics attended A&M. Every now and then you'd 
see, excuse me, you'd see one or two or three. And it

22:06.125 --> 22:12.113
may be, it might have been that A&M was not doing any 
recruiting at that time. At that time, everybody

22:12.852 --> 22:17.758
had to join the Corps. And a lot of people just did 
not want to go into the Corps, so they'd go to other

22:18.779 --> 22:22.945
schools. And I think that's what kept a lot of the 
Hispanics out. They would rather go to other

22:26.349 --> 22:36.121
schools, but they didn't have to join a military 
regiment of some sort. And like I said, another

22:37.583 --> 22:41.728
thing, too, I don't think that A&M had any 
recruiting system for recruiting Spanish

22:42.434 --> 22:51.687
because there was no need, I don't think, because 
actually, let me change that. I think there was no

22:51.787 --> 23:00.500
prospects available because the Spanish were not 
finishing high school. Most were dropouts

23:00.540 --> 23:06.248
because a lot of these schools were 
discriminated, in other words, segregated. And

23:07.049 --> 23:11.175
so every now and then, I guess you'd get one or two, 
but that's it. Even, I understand, in Houston, in

23:12.421 --> 23:22.741
the University of Houston, it wasn't the 
University of Houston then, they called it

23:12.421 --> 23:22.741
something else. There were hardly any Hispanics 
either in these colleges. But like now, now you see

23:28.372 --> 23:33.883
quite a few. So I think that's what kept, that's 
why, it's not that A&M discriminated against

23:35.759 --> 23:51.257
anybody, it's just that first, there were not 
enough high school graduates among the Hispanic

23:35.759 --> 23:51.257
people, among the Hispanic students. And 
secondly, they didn't like the core aspect of it.

23:57.024 --> 24:03.792
They didn't want that because in those days, you 
know, the way that freshman was treated, you're

24:03.974 --> 24:05.415
lucky to come out alive. And they could see a lot of 
that, and they didn't want to undergo that. And

24:08.899 --> 24:13.964
they figured that if they do that to the Anglos, 
look what they do to the Hispanics. Let me change a

24:13.984 --> 24:19.849
little bit and talk about civic and religious 
activities of the Hispanic community in Bryan.

24:20.350 --> 24:21.971
And what role did the church play? Are you talking 
about back then when I was growing up or now? Back

24:26.555 --> 24:27.496
then. Way back? Well, actually, I was baptized in 
the Catholic church. St. Joseph, and that's where

24:33.100 --> 24:44.576
we went to church because there weren't any 
Spanish-speaking churches around.

24:47.500 --> 24:56.172
And

24:47.500 --> 24:56.172
are you asking what role did we play with the church 
or what role did the church play with us? Give me a

24:56.523 --> 24:58.305
little of both. Was there much interaction or did 
that come later? The only thing I know is that the

25:02.070 --> 25:11.242
only special events that we attended was when 
there was a confirmation of some sort. There was,

25:13.485 --> 25:18.091
say, a bazaar to raise benefits. We'd go and 
participate. and watch what was going on and buy a

25:21.127 --> 25:24.671
few things to help the church. And then, of course, 
we'd go to church on Sunday. And we were treated

25:28.354 --> 25:30.837
well. I mean, of course, since I think that the time 
that we were going to church, only about two more

25:31.017 --> 25:40.387
Hispanic families were going. And we were some 
sort of a novelty. We attracted attention because

25:43.070 --> 25:45.932
we were a little different. Hair was dark. Our skin 
was a little darker. But other than that, the

25:51.147 --> 25:56.052
priests were very friendly to us. They were always 
real good to us. And they'd come by. Because in

26:01.217 --> 26:06.682
those days, sometimes the horse and buggy was late 
getting there to pick us up. But if we needed to ride

26:06.742 --> 26:10.046
home, they'd take us home. I said, no, we got a ride 
coming. Sure enough, a little big cluck, cluck,

26:12.468 --> 26:16.312
cluck, there comes a buggy, and we go home. A wagon 
or a Model T Ford, one or two. They were nice. Of

26:21.983 --> 26:27.631
course, mom and papa missed out a lot because they 
didn't understand too much. Because if we'd go to

26:27.691 --> 26:37.324
St. Joseph's Church, it was preached lots of time 
in what you'd call Polish language or maybe

26:27.691 --> 26:37.324
Czechoslovakian language. Or if you go to the 
Italian church, it was preached in Italian. So we

26:40.989 --> 26:41.831
missed out. So this is why I decided to go to the 
Baptist church for a while, where they spoke

26:41.871 --> 26:47.078
English and I could understand it. And I enjoyed 
it. But then later on, The so-called Catholic

26:50.615 --> 27:04.619
Church got away from this speaking their own 
language because they saw that the kids were not

26:50.615 --> 27:04.619
benefiting. The kids understood English better 
than they did their own language. So then they

27:09.227 --> 27:12.252
started hiring priests that could speak both 
languages. So they were kind of bilingual. They'd

27:14.661 --> 27:24.675
speak Polish for the old Polish people, and they'd 
make a little English for the younger, and the

27:14.661 --> 27:24.675
Italian would do the same thing. And that worked 
out pretty good. Of course, to me, I think that the

27:27.139 --> 27:32.907
services were a little long, and I think that had a 
lot to do with it. But now, at the present time,

27:33.258 --> 27:39.827
they've got priests that speak nothing but 
English in most churches now. In our church, we

27:39.847 --> 27:47.599
have a bilingual priest that speaks, right now at 
the present time, that speaks English and

27:39.847 --> 27:47.599
Spanish. And the reason he speaks Spanish, not for 
the people that live and were born here, but

27:48.200 --> 27:56.211
because we have so many citizen newly arrivals 
from Mexico due to the amnesty program. They're

28:04.476 --> 28:11.425
here, they don't understand, so he is also doing a 
little preaching in Spanish. What about civic

28:11.445 --> 28:13.267
involvement at that time? Was there much? Not how 
far back you want to go, Peter. As far as you can take

28:17.472 --> 28:18.433
me. Well, when I was a young man, I was pretty 
involved in YMCA work. and March of Dimes and

28:25.216 --> 28:35.093
let's see, quite a few other things. I can't 
remember some of it, but oh yeah, go ahead. I was

28:40.102 --> 28:46.313
also involved in Parent Teachers Association, 
which you know. the first year when your daddy went

28:46.580 --> 28:51.205
to Ibarra. I was a parent teacher there, but I 
didn't like it, but I was there anyway.

29:03.280 --> 29:07.785
Well, Peter, we had a voice in the city. We could do 
anything we wanted to, but it was up to us to

29:09.807 --> 29:13.752
participate. What happened that so many of us 
spoke Spanish so much that we'd go to these

29:14.913 --> 29:28.013
meetings and we did not want to get involved 
because we felt that we couldn't communicate. We

29:28.294 --> 29:30.537
felt that we couldn't cope with the English 
language. And well, we were afraid of derision

29:31.659 --> 29:38.389
would amount to because of the language. And some 
of that exists right now, spreading time. Some of

29:41.414 --> 29:44.599
the young boys, I mean, some of these people don't 
want to talk. They hold back because they're

29:45.140 --> 29:47.824
afraid that they can't communicate. Yet, they 
speak perfect Spanish. They speak well in

29:50.728 --> 29:52.230
Spanish. But if we want to get involved, it was 
there. They encouraged us to get involved. And I

30:00.543 --> 30:07.954
know I was involved in quite a few things, numerous 
of them, way back there. Actually

30:08.508 --> 30:17.982
I had a little combo myself that we played in high 
school. And we played little high school dances. I

30:22.048 --> 30:33.185
used to play the harmonica and the drums and 
another kid used to play the clarinet and another

30:22.048 --> 30:33.185
one played the guitar and I forget what. But we made 
some noise. And actually we got so good that we went

30:35.812 --> 30:41.338
and played for some of the civic organizations. I 
guess they just wanted to do us a favor, you know,

30:41.378 --> 30:44.682
but it was all right. But there weren't too many 
things that Bryan was doing those days other than

30:46.124 --> 31:00.160
YMCA and there was no boys club, you know, and there 
were no JC's. The Chamber of Commerce was very

31:00.220 --> 31:05.346
small and it was, now that was a place where We never 
participated because it was made up only of the

31:05.849 --> 31:13.438
so-called elite people, you know, people who ran 
the community. And it was not inviting to working

31:14.420 --> 31:19.126
people, you know, blue collar people. It was not 
inviting. And so, however, now it is. Now they want

31:24.753 --> 31:29.038
anybody, but not nowadays. Can you tell me a little 
bit about Brian B's Recreational Club? You

31:32.953 --> 31:34.235
mentioned the Boys Club earlier. I know that this 
eventually more or less evolved into that. Can you

31:37.979 --> 31:40.602
tell me why it was started and basically what it 
did? Well, what it was, it was a group of boys that I

31:40.903 --> 31:47.470
started as a Cub Pack. It was a Cub Pack group. And 
there were kids. Some of those kids actually were

31:51.856 --> 31:55.240
from broken homes. I could name them if you wanted 
to, but I don't care for doing that. And then they

31:59.005 --> 32:00.807
grew out of it. And I was a cup pack assistant cup 
master. I was just beginning myself. And then

32:08.715 --> 32:10.918
later they grew into Boy Scouts. And I've had them 
for a long time in Boy Scouts. And they were good

32:14.221 --> 32:16.504
troops. And I mean, we'd win all these prizes when 
we'd compete with other troops. And then they

32:22.009 --> 32:23.511
outgrew that. And then I didn't want these boys to 
disperse because where would they go? So what I

32:28.287 --> 32:30.850
did, I decided to organize a baseball team. And we 
organized a baseball team. And there was a

32:34.494 --> 32:38.518
suggestion to the boys to come out with a name. And 
some of them came up with different kind of names.

32:41.462 --> 32:45.666
And they chose Bees because they had a reason for 
that. I remember something like the Bees, by

32:45.967 --> 32:52.534
working together, would produce something 
worthwhile. You know? And because

32:53.832 --> 33:07.407
of that, we decided

32:53.832 --> 33:07.407
to play different teams from different places. 
And

33:07.487 --> 33:21.983
there was a good baseball park here that at one time 
housed a professional baseball team in Bryant.

33:22.975 --> 33:29.726
But they went broke, and then another team decided 
to move in. They went broke, and so the park was just

33:29.826 --> 33:33.612
laying there. I mean, it looked like a lake. The 
fence had fallen. The roof had caved in, and it was

33:39.141 --> 33:42.827
in bad shape. So I told the kids that I would go see 
the owner, Mr. Travis Bryan. see if he'd let us fix

33:50.380 --> 33:55.187
the park so we could play in it. So I went to see him. 
And he told me, he said, I'm not loaning any money on

33:56.269 --> 34:00.475
that park. I said, well, I'm not asking for a loan. 
What I want is just for you to give us an opportunity

34:03.339 --> 34:08.006
to put that park back like it was. He said, well, 
that would entail a lot of money and a lot of

34:08.026 --> 34:12.673
sacrifice, a lot of work. You can't do that. I said, 
well, I will try. He said, if you can do it, you go

34:15.216 --> 34:17.920
right ahead. So we took it. And sure enough, we did. 
We made that park, put it back like it was brand new.

34:26.684 --> 34:30.589
And that enabled a lot of other teams to play in it. 
It enabled A&M Consolidated to play there. A&M

34:34.153 --> 34:37.336
Consolidated had to call me to schedule the game. 
And also Bryan High School enabled them. It also

34:41.080 --> 34:48.709
enabled a black baseball team to play there, a 
black high school baseball team. The American

34:48.729 --> 34:49.750
Legion. and enable also the

34:51.215 --> 35:00.163
Bryan Air Force teams to play there. Because at 
that time, we had the Air Force here. And of course,

35:05.267 --> 35:07.969
we played there, the Bryan Bees. And we were 
sponsoring two teams, the Bryan Bees, the Bryan

35:08.069 --> 35:15.035
Aztecs, and then later on, the Bryan Merchants. We 
played there, and I scheduled all

35:15.055 --> 35:20.800
those games. Shortly after that, I became a member 
of the Bryant Park Board. And Mr. Carbosier was the

35:27.906 --> 35:30.990
chairman of the board. No, he was not. Someone else 
was. Mrs. Culpepper, I think, was chairman of the

35:34.694 --> 35:36.737
board. And I suggested to Mr. Carbosier that the 
city of Bryant should buy that park. And so he said

35:43.685 --> 35:47.590
he thought that was a good idea. And so we went to see 
Mr. Bryant. We made a very good deal with it, good

35:51.880 --> 35:54.703
deal. So then Mr. Carabasio went and made a motion 
to the park board, and we buy the park. I second the

36:02.652 --> 36:03.593
motion. And then it was sent to the city council, I 
don't know, the Brian commission, the Brian

36:04.594 --> 36:10.141
commission. And they voted to buy the park. And I 
named the park Travis.

36:17.378 --> 36:20.541
I decided to give it a name, and I just thought I'd 
name it Travis. I think it's called Travis today.

36:23.704 --> 36:32.993
But as a result of that accomplishment on behalf of 
the Brian B's, we accommodated a lot of people, a

36:23.704 --> 36:32.993
lot of kids. And they played that for years and for 
years. Actually, it kept me busy at the office. I

36:39.039 --> 36:42.042
was doing more work for that park than I was doing 
for my own job. I was neglecting my own job and kind

36:42.362 --> 36:47.267
of that, but nobody there seemed to mind it. What 
about the Boys Club? And then, of course,

36:49.178 --> 37:01.770
actually, I also, because of that, somehow they 
approached me about organizing, help organize

36:49.178 --> 37:01.770
the, you should call it a league team. And I was very 
instrumental in organizing, helping with that.

37:06.014 --> 37:16.444
And then, of course, one of my members, Brian Bees,

37:06.014 --> 37:16.444
wanted to set it, He said, you know, we're growing 
now. We're going to leave this team. We're going to

37:23.436 --> 37:24.277
break out. What's after that? And he suggested to 
me that he'd heard of Brian Boyd's club in

37:27.202 --> 37:32.790
different places. And I didn't even know what a 
Brian Boyd's club was. And he explained it to me.

37:37.484 --> 37:38.786
And I thought it was a good idea. So I told him, I 
said, do you know of anybody that you could contact

37:38.846 --> 37:46.619
that would, yeah, I know Mr. So-and-so. So he, I 
can't remember this gentleman's name, a

37:46.659 --> 37:55.673
wonderful person because he came over and talked 
to me and talked to other people. And then we

37:55.794 --> 38:04.167
decided to get together and we met in an old lumber 
yard in Bryan. And actually, we even invited WT

38:05.108 --> 38:12.816
McDonald, who was the present judge at that time, 
district judge, 85th District Court judge. And he

38:14.037 --> 38:31.875
got up and didn't discourage us, but in essence, he 
said that he didn't think people would buy

38:14.037 --> 38:31.875
anything like that here in Bryan, that people in 
Bryan would not support it because it's going to

38:14.037 --> 38:31.875
take money. But anyway, we decided to go ahead and 
start one. So at the second meeting, we got a

38:41.343 --> 38:50.673
charter group. We named the charter members. And 
Mrs. Parker, Marianne Parker, was at that time.

38:57.440 --> 39:01.525
And we made her chairman of the charter. because we 
figured we needed her influence in the community.

39:06.714 --> 39:09.136
And we got started. Then it was up to us to go out and 
recruit kids to come and join. And we went out and

39:13.941 --> 39:16.624
recruited a bunch of kids. And they started 
coming, and some people started donating

39:17.525 --> 39:24.813
basketballs and little pool tables. And Mrs. 
Parker and I, we decided to ride for a boat We went to

39:32.015 --> 39:38.524
the campus, and we got thrown out until we got off 
the campus. We made a little money off that boat. We

39:41.108 --> 39:46.875
were able to buy more supplies, and that's how we 
got started. Not only Curtis Dickey, but

39:48.017 --> 40:00.334
Bernstein and others that played real well for 
Cheryl, made a name for themselves,

39:48.017 --> 40:00.334
they went through Boy's Club. And we have a lot of 
kids that went through there that were from broken

40:01.192 --> 40:09.921
homes, and now today are successful people in the 
world. And so I think that the Boys Club was a good

40:10.842 --> 40:16.108
thing for Brian. And I want you to know that I don't 
want to take credit for all that because of

40:17.329 --> 40:27.520
starting it, but I was one of the members that 
started. A lot of Hispanic kids go through there

40:27.753 --> 40:29.556
also? A lot of Hispanic kids were going. At that 
time, we were very much involved. And we worked

40:33.923 --> 40:35.466
hard to get it going. But the overall success of it, 
as it is today, belongs to the community of Bryan

40:36.408 --> 40:48.889
and to the United Fund who are now supporting it. 
But that's how it got started. It was bleak when we

40:52.094 --> 40:53.777
started. And it looked like every year it got 
bleaker, but then we never gave up. And we had

40:58.991 --> 41:09.501
criticism from people saying that we were 
accommodating kids that were not from good

40:58.991 --> 41:09.501
families. But actually, that's the kind of kids we 
wanted. Kids that had problems, kids from broken

41:12.784 --> 41:15.287
homes. And we realized it was a challenge, but we 
had a lot of volunteers work with those kids. And

41:21.773 --> 41:24.135
they turned out to be good kids later on. Kids that 
later on paid back some of the benefits that they

41:26.193 --> 41:37.549
derived from Boys Club by working in Boys Club 
voluntarily and helping other kids. This was very

41:37.589 --> 41:38.990
obvious. It's obvious right now. So, these kids, 
Brian Bees, did well. Boys Club was an aftermath of

41:47.382 --> 41:50.606
that. I think what I've read earlier says that at 
least Half of these people, or half of these boys

41:53.630 --> 41:58.396
involved in the Brian B's Club actually went to 
finish college. Right, they did. Actually, more

42:00.119 --> 42:02.402
than half of them went to finish college. None of 
them dreamed that they would ever go to college.

42:07.889 --> 42:15.059
This came about because of their athletic 
ability, their baseball playing. I remember that

42:16.261 --> 42:22.489
when I went with them to Allen Academy and asked the 
director there, that

42:23.465 --> 42:30.413
I would appreciate if you'd give them a trial to see 
if they'd get a scholarship. And he said, well,

42:30.473 --> 42:32.876
we've given too many scholarships already. I 
said, well, why don't you just give them a trial for

42:33.937 --> 42:38.622
maybe later on you may have scholarships. Well, he 
said, he directed me to the coach, and the coach

42:38.682 --> 42:44.008
gave him a trial. And sure enough, the coach took 
about eight of them right off the bat and gave him

42:44.088 --> 42:48.093
scholarships. And for the first time in the 
history of Allen Academy, They won a state junior

42:52.186 --> 42:55.069
college championship. Without that group, they 
couldn't have done it because the coaches said it

42:55.490 --> 43:00.115
themselves. And after that year, they had a big 
banquet for all those kids. And then later on, more

43:05.041 --> 43:08.485
Bs went down and more Bs went down. Actually, they 
wanted all our boys because we had them. And I'll

43:12.309 --> 43:13.231
tell you another thing. We had such a good team that 
in that year, I don't remember what year it was, A&M

43:13.291 --> 43:21.400
won the district. Texas A&M? Texas A&M, and they 
wanted to give us a practice game, and Bill Bell

43:24.715 --> 43:32.866
said, you can announce it like a real game because 
we're going to play. I said, okay. So we announced

43:34.489 --> 43:39.836
it, and we had a full stadium, and we beat them 
pretty bad. I forget, I think at that time it was

43:39.916 --> 43:45.885
3-2, and he felt real bad about it. The following 
year, he won again the district. The Southwest

43:49.812 --> 43:50.693
Conference? Southwest Conference, yeah. And so 
we beat him again. And I think we shut him, I think 61

43:55.598 --> 44:00.623
the second time. That's how good our team was. And 
that was made up of these kids that had this dream of

44:03.006 --> 44:09.493
playing baseball and improving themselves. And 
today, a lot of them are successful boys. Some are

44:12.425 --> 44:13.786
teaching school. Some have got good business. And 
about 20 years ago, we had a reunion that gave me a

44:15.228 --> 44:24.158
surprise party. Had about 150 kids there. But I 
mean, they were there. And then about 10 years

44:31.346 --> 44:35.230
after that, they had another reunion. So we still 
stay together. We communicate, and they

44:37.332 --> 44:39.615
communicate with me.
